La vibra de Harry era diferente en este video y me encantó, era muy relajado y tenía mucha onda, además de ser muy gracioso todo el tiempo.
6:14 W

Watched this video so many times and on my just noticed this. Any one notice the editing mistake at around 6:30 when Tobi saw the card signed by the queen haha
Ksi is having a bad day
how does 70k make 100k?
Icl at this point toby has max aura
7 boxes, 10k each... 70k? No? 😅
The only reason I watched this video (KSI)

They had to blur some much put of Tobis box 😂😂
bobbe
So that’s what lovehoney is
Simon foreshadowing his penalty goal miss from charity match 2025, its insane
What did Simon steal
what is the football they used
Vik's box was dumb. #ihateVik
Vik's gold bar is worth around £14k 🤯🤯
Why does Vik always repeat himself
Why is JJ allways having to wear these outfits? SCRPTED?
General knowledge 😂😂😂
Vik and Josh created the best boxes, such masterminds
Musical chairs was hilarious, especially that last round lol Ethan: hovers over the chair Harry: straight up snatches the chair
29:38 to see the object they blurred out
Thank you now i can talk to my friend without anyone knowing that we are nor what we’re saying 😊

9:53 the funniest part is I thought about this happening just before it happened 😂😭
2:40 Vikmon 😂😂😂😂😭😭 6:10 vikmon 😂
Great vid guys!!
The look on JJ’s face riding the bike was hilarious!! He looked amazed that he was able to ride it! 😂😂
The bear is hilarious! 😂😂
Harry really regretted not stealing Ethan’s box lol. You could tell he was genuinely sad! 😂😂
looking back on this video.. i've noticed that ethan was really touching himself for a long while lmao. bro better get checked
37:50 SCOTT STERLING
Have gotta say at 29:40, the edit on JJ as ‘general knowledge’ is one of the best edits on the channel 👌👌👌
A millionaire bribing someone to tell him the box worth 10k for 5k. Bro is not good with money
That motorcycle was un taxed and had no mot LOL so funny
envy is a sin😂 oh harry😂
Simon got his payback with the cat tree
8:31, 20:50 😂😂😂
1 ticket to 4 different war zones is diabolical
In the intro he said $100,000 in total and £10,000 each
Ice bath and the toaster 😂
6:09 🤨🤨🤨🤨 SIMONNN??? LMFAO
This flippen video wss jokes thanks for the best content lads❤
Yo it took me over a year to save up to buy an ROG ally PC to have any sense of self joy and Simon standing there with one his hands probably not even knowing what it is 😂😂
มาชมด้วยครับ
4:50 in what world is a wii 325 quid
As a iranian , we will happy to simon come IR
The plane tickets and house is mental 😂
Great video as always! The envy of fomo is most interesting to me. I have fragheads asylum and love the quality of that already.
Just found these guys today and for the life of me can't figure out why they keep JJ around.  Cheating, dishonest, no integrity... Just really bring the vida down imo.  Just feels like what sleazy thing is he going to do next.
41:58 YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS CRAZY
Josh is so boring
12:54
What was the blurred thing in the first box
this was such a fun video please do more of these
now rewatching :
At 35:54 it's just the British looting the Indians gold 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mr Beast is the father these shows and best and  number one youtuber
Please do this again😭
Nice too see you guys ask something about my country South Africa 😊❤
damn when you couldn’t think “zerkahz” head could get any bigger, you just compare him from present to 1 year ago and how fat he was makes his head even bigger HAHAHAHA
The urge to dislike this video Bcoz we could clearly see that lady told jj that the box at far right was the best and he took it Shame on you jj
As an American this was the hardest game of corn hole to watch
5:11 ethan and simon made it look so dirty😂😂
iran mentioned
Hopefully Ethan got that rash sorted
8:00 "Toby,... can I have a go?"
What is that blured thing
Why did they have to turn around?
This video made me really dislike Vik. Early on the video making the comments saying he could care less. And then literally having everyone not try to touch any of the gold.
YouTube use to be 5 star ratings dam 32:06
simon's 'general knowledge 🪖🫡' from how i met your mother

When the line came out Ethan grabbed his sack😭
Harry became mr krabs in the end
tobjzl condoms🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

If this was filmed today bog would have had the golf clubs out of the KSI box in a flash but he didn't even look at them 😂
Ok
Jj is sick 😂😂
I think the Last supper Art should be their new banner image tbh. You guys like so they consider it.

This video is perfect
Curious to know what Simon took from Tobi's box
So.. ksi is considered as black mail
sss
Can i have the hustlers university please
Bro vik getting his own box is clutch, pure gold doesn't lose value
The plane tickets actually sent me😂😂😂😂
The musical chairs was so good, Ethan was so competitive, where on earth did that come from 😂😂
I don't like KSI he's such a poor sport always trying to get the best of everything if not he cries and makes the video boring
They blackmailed jj
8:34 Those subtitles... Ahh yes the famous rapper JLTE....
Ethan’s box got me screaming “man bro got my favorite things”
Im not a materialistic person at all. But jj wanted the bike and telescope and jj took the telescope. All these boys are multi millionaires, jj being the wealthiest, why be disapponted if he can buy 20,000 telescopes, if we wanted too?
Did ANNNNNYYYYONE else notice when Ethan decided to play a little grabby grabby with his weenie on camera at 4:39 and AGAIN at 5:11......and he's really YANKING on it then....itchy? Or something else?? 🤔🤨🧐
31:50 i am surprised that tobi could spell hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia
But what did Simon pick out of Tobi's box?
28:36 Vik saying “it’s not looking good bruv” from Castillo TikTok’s before it became a thing on InSide 😂
31:50 Ethan 😂
28:35 IS IT ME OR DID SOMEONE SAY ITS NOT LOOKING GOOD BRUV!!😳

The musical chairs hilarías 😂😂

Rewatching this now after watching inside and i could hear vik saying "it's not looking good brev" at 28:33 , can't be a coincidence brev 😂
South Africa mentioned AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
JJ’s face 😂😂😂 24:08
Reading comments before finishing the video equals spoilers, Reading comments after finishing the video equals funny moments
Afghanistan ❤❤

شاید توش دودول بود  کی چه میدونه😮

Something about harry stealing from jj doesn’t seem right
1 question. Now that I wantched it. Did simon go on a trip-trip everywhere his tickets were taking him
JJ:"i wanna put their letter in my mouth" Tobi: what? JJ: What?😂
i still dont understand how 10,000 x 7 is 100,000 maybe they were generous and used their own money
My favourite sidemen Sunday came out on my birthday 😄
Hilarious 😂😂😂
Simon saying bullets got me😂but to be fair though if I weren't a south African, I wouldn't know either
we dont give enough credits to the sidemen editors
8:11 😭😭
I'm just jealous of harry getting 10k cash can't even afford to get a streaming pc to be able to start streaming on twitch
josh looks clapped btw
What a music vik box?
That rc plane would double in price in few years if kept in the box(sealed and new)
harry's face when he sees the money and his voice is just literal pure gold!!!
what the hell is blured in tobis box on the ground?
30:10 TANZANIAAAA, I know because it’s one of my Geography Paper2 case studies. Hopefully I do well in ST2 next month results :) 20.2.24

What is the Currency of South Africa? Bullet bruh 😂😂😂😂
« I activate the steal🙋🏻‍♂️ »💀
Definitely need that e bike to get back and forth to work 😂
After the sidemen whole in the wall I am convinced JJ has a crush on simon
People who watched this in 2024 then like!!!
The box at 27ish minutes is so lame. I'm so confused why they liked it so much. It's all just junk to me hahahab😅
Ohhhh so this is where that ksi dude is from. I remember hearing about him boxing or something idfk 😅
Congrats on your new home Simon :D

Investing money in Gold, could Vik be more Indian. Props !

I swear KSI always gets the outfit
In case anyone was curious Boxes:   Tobi - Simon Box Ethan - Harry Box JJ - Tobi’s Box Josh - Ethan Box Vik - Vik Box Harry - Josh’s Box Simon - JJ’s Box
Simon ->tobi Harry->ethan Tobi->ksi Ethan-> Josh Ksi->simon Vikk->vikk Josh->harry
Corn hole was all comedy
I came back to say PT 3 please ?
Free Palestine
12:14 I can't get over the fact that out of all the good things in the boxes harry lost it at "cheese wheel"
It's rly sad that i see my country(Iran) among other low level countries in that list... It's a shame cuz Iran is a beautiful place u can google it, a rich history and educated ppl known for their hospitality. the only problem is this evil regim and government.
redhead with the black shorts cant stop playing with his dingaling the whole time
The title says 100K but only spent 10K on the boxes?? Anyone else catch that?
sidemen
36:00 anyone else notice Harry pocket the gold bar lmfao
I feel like someone needs to explain to them that 10 x 7 is not 100
jack should be fired
14:32 fire
This video is insane
KSI costume is getting more and more better looking😂
I love how they copy Mr beast thumbnail 😂
8:00 Ethan's like the little brother in this part awww😭😭
9:45 😂 wtf the best  musical chairs i ever seen
What did Simon take from tobi’s box did I miss something??
Nothing more funny then watching grown men play musical chairs 😅
I love this video but the time i was watching it my grandpa died
10,000 each, 7 boxes equals 70,000 not 100,000😂😂😂
naaaah the crew needs to have a comedic sense too and challenge the players not sell out lmao, don't accept the bribery!
@18:40 Kirsty told JJ which box is good.
Why is the one with the green t-shirt constantly grabbing his nuts 🥜
wtf is ethan doing at 5:11
A wii is like 45$ bucks and not 375 hahaha
25:16 why are they using facial shavers?!

Why are Ethan always grabbing himself
Does Ethan have some VD of some sort!? He’s always fondling himself, it’s actually weird. I know people meme about it but legitimately, it’s pretty creepy tbh.
Dikstar123

41:50 Simon was crying literally 😒

The musical chairs was freaking hilarious
What’s the name of the motorbike Ethan got out of Harry’s box
How to donate
I swear I could be crying but the second I start watching them they make my day😂
I love the peek from harry at 20:59
I love how they want to keep the integrity of the video by making sure jj couldnt pay his way out of things.
37:30 🤣🤣🤣🤣
super competetive musical chairs, we need a full vid of that with forfeits
7x10 isn't it £70? 😂 so not 100k but £70k lol
Eithan be scratching them balls alot in the vid he ok? Ahahah
The things I’d do for a derbi and Ethan don’t care 😂
22:07 good afternoon
I feel like Harry is always unlucky in these mystery box videos but he finally got lucky😂
9:50 12:45
How does 7 boxes each 10k in value add up to 100k?
hahaha simon one ticket to iran made me smile that finally my country got mentioned in a vid..even tho it was pronounced horribly..welcome to iran simon!
Can we just point out the mafs here. Each sidemen got 10,000 for the box. there are 7 sidemen 10,000x7 = 70,000
Who’s box did JJ get? Vik’s?
vikks was a w
I sure hope those flights were first class 😭
Ethan grabbing is crotch constantly 😂
7 X 10,000 = 100,000 got it cheers
10,000 X 7 = 100,000 yes 👍
the wii is worth a fuckin 10th  of 350 bruh what are yall smokin
Did Ethan have crabs during this video? He can not stop scratching himself
Harry and Ethan playing musical chairs was singlehandedly the best 20 seconds of content of all time

As a South African , I am disappointed
A flight to Iran is not funny or scary. It’s a beautiful country
Famous Harry quote “Does cockroach have wing?”
What is the song at the end called? :)
Song at 34:27?
mr beasts thumbnail is crazy 💀
Bro did mrbeast 💀💀💀🔫😶‍🌫️

asssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssawwww
Too long and boring
In what world is a Wii £325? 😂😂😂
why does ethan keep touching his balls
We need part 2 of this🔥
Kinda hope a new Ksi character spawns in soon, a quiz show hosted by General Knowledge would be class
If this doesn't brighten your day, I don't know what will!
AKA “WE PRETEND WE’RE MR BEAST”
Each of the boys were given 10,000 dollars and there were 7 boxes… So how tf does that equal 100,000 dollars worth of stuff? I’m pretty sure it’s 70,000 😂😂
What is all this South African slander?😂😂😂
Where do we get to watch simon get killed in war zones?
As a afghan that ending bit with Simon was funny man said one way ticket to Afghanistan 😂😂😂 I mean it’s a beautiful country suin they don’t show u on media.
325 for a wii?? In what universe ? XD
ksi why are u so black bro
Why is Ethan always touching himself. Lol
Ksi type question is crazy
Ethan scratching WILD this episode lol
Ah yes 7 boxes, 10,000 pounds each, 10,000 x 7 = 100,000
I’ve never actually cried of latter but musical chairs I did
MrBeast Copy
1000000 split up for all y’all to spend
josh's box is by far the best
please do a second one of these this was sick
Iam from Afghanistan come to Afghanistan simon
Why do u keep switching between £ and $
Simon should donate the house to someone
Ethan spends half the time grabbing his balls and scratching them 😂😂
I almost cried 😢
It was the last loon
What happened to Simon and Tobi’s deal
30:50 harry has some crazy forearm muscles ✨
they should do a part 2
8:11 ethans casual "ow"🤣🤣🤣🤣
"the game is the game" i hope someone reminds JJ that when hes on the bad team for the next holiday if he is lol
Hustler’s university punch line I’m subbing for that
Y’all spoiled way too much
🇿🇦the bullet😂
Nobody gonna talk about how Toby Got a signed card from the Queen even though shes dead
Guys what's the title of the music when there playing the musical chairs is that right?
Bra the most expensive thing in the box is not just a bear but a baby bear. What tipe of mother f#$@er will kill a baby bear👁️👁️
We need a part II of this 🔥
Nintendo Wii £325? What?
I don’t like the part at 18:17 where Simon tells Harry to steal AFTER JJ got his box, despite the card saying Harry could only use it before they open the box.
9:21😂😂😂 9:47 😂😂😂 37:22 till 38:55 jj on Simon 😂😂😂
So tobi got who’s box?
Why Ethan keep itching fr 😂🦀
Nice idea👍
Simon welcome to Bulgaria
SO CORNY
Wait how’d it add to 100k when there 7 of em and each box is 10k might have just missed something said or something but idk
The way how Ethan and Harry playing musical chairs against each other made my day 😂
JJ's one way tickets killed me 😂😂
The chair has seen better days
The fact JJ did a horrible box and had the chance to get his own box 😂😂
is that dude fired yet? i need to know. fck that dude
can i have your piano ksi?...please
Hustler's University..... yep that's definitely a hustle.
Nahhh JJ ruined the vid
i like how they act like they can’t buy absolutely everything seen in every box 😂
Why did no one want jjs box tho
vikkstar has mastered the skill of spanking 😂😂🤣
I wouldve LOVED Ethan's box. That Hamilton wheel table would've had me GASSED
why tf came the wii 325
Wonder what Simon took from Tobies box
Bro I'm actually crying laughing from the musical char part
I wish I was Harry rn
EW NO
I hope that guy get the 5k anyways hes just trying to survive
I am from Iran and I am so happy
We need a part 2
Ethan and Ksi is best combo
What did Simon take from Toby?
Simon needs to go to his Bulgaria house for a video
Can we get a part 2 of this concept
Ethan scratching his balls at 6:39
Ethans ALWAYS grabbing his bits 🤨😂
vik needs to lose the dont care attitude its just annoying
WHAT WAS THE BLURRED THING?
9:21
Simon got Hustlers University 💀
32:25
i woudve stole ksi's grandfather clock or gramaphone
Ethan is the least deserving of anything good
Who’s was the first box ?
Why tf is Ethan’s hand constantly on his balls
Banger
In no world is a wii $300 anymore
Sidemen renovation home video in Bulgaria coming up lol
I’d think they’d know how to buy som crazy stuff with them being so rich they always pick the simple things 😂
It's so funny when josh goes to sit on the chair and Harry takes the chair
6:31 They left it uncensored here..
4:09 dodgy Simon salute
I was to get nay box I would have got the box josh chose
12:25 'Should have', not 'should of' lol
Buncha fairies
Yall gon skip the fact that my country's currency is Bullets?🤣
This video is one of the best sidemen videos ever, genuinely a fucken classic
why is Ethan grabbing himself 😭
yo bro this video gave me food poison
Holy shot simon got a ticket to flight in my country iran that's crazy dude
I need to a ticket to Afghanistan my home country 😂
Simon, Use your ticket and come to Iran, mate. 🇮🇷❤️
I wish JJ had the best box so it could seem like he can be nice sometimes
why was one of them constantly scratching his balls? 😂they buzzed with an overabundance of emotions?
It was such a Vik thing to do with the gold 😂
u copied mrbeast
not harry dragging the chair around in musical chairs and breaking it.. never laughed much in my life lmfaoo
the crew needs to make at least 1 mystery box forfeit next time
به عنوان یک ایرانی بهم برخورد😂😂
Imagine if Harry activated the steal on Vik's box
5:11 look at Ethan catching his balls to intensly 😂😅
The tickets were all one way 🤣😂😭
💀
5:11 what is bro grabbing there 💀💀
33:54 Simon said it. Half way there everybody.
5:11 Ethan..
The likelihood vik choosing his box is surprising 16.67%.
212 reference from josh is elite
22:35 LOL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was just scrolling through videos and found a mr beast video on top of this video with the thumbnail identical....
Ethan 5:11
do this again with the sidefriends pls i enjoyed this concept
There is one thing to understand if Harry had used steal on Vik, He would have won 10K worth of gold with 10 grand That would be the Peak
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxkFhACvDaEXHinmUKBf5NVbC98m9Vf79v
Good video but I think they should give the boxes to the FANS . They all pick one  FAn that's posting and a real FAN  so there be 7 winners it would make it More intense like think about. JJ gets the worst things to give away to his crew cause he knows that if they really wanted the stuff they could buy it. But for the FANS it would be a life changing.
Ok we want the 100k boxes now, let’s get this video to a million likes
Did yall see Ethan get smacked in the I face by the gokart handle 😂😂
Best gift is the hustlers uni membership
Ksi didn't even do the shopping booooo 🤔🤔🤔
This was great 😂😂😂😂 honestly please do the 100k a box vid that would be epic and go hard
Great video 😊
Kon looks good uno
Monday left me broken
We all felt it when Harry knew about everything in Ethan’s box and couldn’t have it
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Courseeeeeee
44:00 Iran is literally so beautiful, idk why he is upset. Classic Rich Western people. Literally all big tourists put it in their top 10 countries. I am not from Iran btw but the truth is the truth
Imagine if Harry used his steal on Viks box
Cant lie JJ is annoying in videos like this, he always buys awful stuff for other people and then if it goes wrong or he ends up with the bad stuff he tries to pay or fame his way out. can be funny sometimes but eh
Y'all don't know the currency of South Africa isn't it common sense especially from people who live in UK 🤦🏻‍♀️
How does this video have 8 milion vieuws but only 3k likes???
but why did zerka tell the code to harry?!
Egg
Vik did the most indian diwali thing lol!
I saw u at shop
Welcome to the jungle 🎉 Bulgaria is the best ❤
Tax free gifts, these boys are very smart, business expense straight away 10k each, avoiding  close to 50% tax
bro i saw ethan scratch his balls so much
Come to Bulgaria, all bulgarians gonna appreciate it and repair the house we waiting all of u 🤙
Would love to see this but the crew get what’s in the box 😂 all terrified of getting a KSI box but the Josh box being the real villain
Bullets is South African currencies best line😂😂😂
6:42 got me rolling
vic just doesnt even bother anymore he always gotta kill the vibe
One way ticket to Afghanistan wow
Why did they have to Turn around before opening the Box?
A sub would mean the world🙏
POV: me josh got so much cool things POV: josh squashiesssss!!!!!!!
This bears a striking resemblance to a Mr Beast thumbnail... 😂 Athough in the words of the great W2S: "The game's the game"
Simon's never allowed to get spankings as a punishment after that XD
The editor did toby dirty in the first 2 minutes
I’ma need that hustlers university fs
JJ had Nike shoes whilst he’s sponsored by adidas
I don’t understand how people like sidemen more than beta squad, beta squad are so much better. These guys are just annoying
I felt kinda sad about the bear, but then I looked up and realized, we have a taxidermy buzzard 😭😭
Tanzania 🔥🔥 on the map
I haven’t watched sidemen in ages. I’m mad I stopped. Also, Ethan needs to get his balls checked.
where do the sidemen get thier music from?
I hope bro still got that 5k lol
No one is going to talk about how when the first box was opened Ethan was scratching away at his balls 😮
https://youtu.be/oCA2Y8MiUtw
An
not me vibing to the music at the end
copy of mrbeasts vid  thumbnail
9:44 and 9:55 gave me the laugh that almost killed me
😂
Vik’s box was by far the best one
10000 grad worth nothing to them
😂😂😂😂😂
Great video. Just imagine if Harry had used his steal on Vics box. He would of been laughing there.
jesus was a prophit only
why do they say "dollars"? I thought they were British?
Nice contents
ya habibi come to Iran😂
True facts broskie
31:47 WHAT IS ETHAN DOING TO TOBI 😭
Next time doing it with fans would be better. Like they said to KSI, he could just buy everything the boxes lol
Who had Which box
mini said the south african currency is bullet and honestly i aint offended
Such a good and fun video!
This is class I hope we get another one of these
I like what Simon got 😅
Wowwww Con’s looking skinny at 18:11. Good for him
Send me that bowling ball lmao thats an overseas ball I want
Ksi❤❤
😂😂😂
As an afghani your dead Simon 💀😭
What did Simon take from tobi’s box
Did josh choose the shirt over the signed ronaldo boot?
14:24 Ethan is a good friend even tho harry was very upset and disappointed he wanted to cheer him up
7 boxes, 10k each and they all cost 100k not 70k??
Beast clones
They should make this a series where they make fans participate
30:16 Ethan laughing at Kenya when Kenya is legit the neighboring country of Tanzania, where Kilimanjaro is....
as a Ukrainian i am glad that russia is like the same shity place as Afghanistan and the others. Russian is totally the worst thing ever.
Great video!!
PLEASE DO THIS AFAIN
Harry being devastated with Ethan taking his box is hilarious
Imagine taking Mrbeast his video idea
5:10  Ayooo Ethan scratching them balls 😂💀
Ethan needs to clean his balls hes always scratching in videos its 🤢
6:31 they forgot to unblur the thing on the bottom left
abc
Whos was the first box?
So what did Simon get from Toby’s box then
This basiclly is just a mr beast video where they open up every single box
W vid
got 4 acres to ride a bike with road tires
The ending is arguably one of the best in Sidemen history! THE TICKETS 😂😂😂😂😂
31:51 why is Ethan acting like that near his coleagues
I’m a the only Bulgarian who is in shock to hear that Simon is a Bulgarian home owner😂
Sick video..like it alot is fun and exciting
They should visit the house in Bulgaria
Hustlers university bro that had me dying 😂
❤
Another flexing video nice
Heyy ia am on vacation in bulgaria
Why’s Ethan keep scratchin his wood😭 wrong outfit for filming 😂
not them scratchin their balls doh LOL
The Bulgarian Home Owner Caught me Off Guard :O

Bro come to iran its not even bad
5:11 not ethan scratching his thing 🤨🤨
5:10 What cha doin their Ethan??🤨
Side man 😂
Josh got the best box
Sidemen are the best youtubers
lmao, as a Haitian i'll take the ticket. Maybe now's not the best time to go but...
the ticket to Afghanistan made me choke on my own saliva LMAO 43:45
Is ethan feeling okay first box bro looked bit itchy
harry wasted 10000 just to get 10000 😂

11:54 they are a good nostalgic childhood guys then they have this this is next level
🇿🇦🇿🇦🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾❤
I'm crying at Ethan and Harry going at it in musical chairs bruh
I love sidemen but like hide And seek's are so boring it's not 2017 anymore, but this was a banger
Bro Ethan has to stop scratching his balls
Kon looking good
video idea: refurbishing the Bulgarian home
The thumbnail is VERY familiar
Watched it 3 times and only just realized that simon choose the wrong box already  in the beginning to get the be spanked box😅
Welcome to Bulgaria 🇧🇬🇧🇬
31:06 WTF Harry 😭
100,000K box please!!!
Why is Ethan squeezing his dong so much
Go on 5 minutes and 10 seconds and look on the bottom left
This is had became a sad group, a sad outcome, oversexualized themes, example: 4:10, and whether they like it or not their audience is young, another example, 5:05, admitting to overpricing items, little care for fans, they know they want the money, then shortly after more sexualized themes appear, a sad sad group
Why did they needed to turn around?
Lol the guys upset about the prizes is humbling I’m sure they can all buy Lambos 😂
The one in the green at the start of the vid where the first box is open green shirt is touching hi dawggg I just saw that 😮
simon should go to afghanistan. its not bad at all
"My intrusive thoughts when i sae the thumbnail with harry near the 100k Box." Is Harry's Mom Inside that Box
Over the years  i think it’s been shown that simon is actually the best in math
The one way 💀
I feel super violated with that low camera angle  looking up at JJ 🤣
Im surprise the sidemen hasnt done/thought to do Sidecards 2.0 for the upcoming charity match with everyone involved with the selling going to the charity of the match, on top of ticket sales
That prank with one way to Afghanistan got me good
Who else saw Ethan at 15:10
Ethan's ball itchy af
I'm just glad I didn't drink anything while watching the musical chairs part ... I would have absolutely sprayed the drink everywhere lol ...
This video was epic
25:31
25:01
this video was decent but why did it had so low views?
God is good and Jesus is our savior and they love us all so much  and wants us to be with them we just have to put in the work and please repent and spread the word and love and bless each other and God bless
Ethan needs to go check his dingaling with all that scratching he was doing down there...boy go shower lol
Simon was gonna cry.
3:06 bare spit tobi, bare spit
Storror and sidemen hide n seek🤲✌
I got a idea how about yall do guess the price of yalls  Sidemen stuff
Yo that Hamilton wheel is insane!
We've been robbed of a great moment when Vikk got his own box.
I love how there would be basically no risk if they didnt all know KSI would make a stinker of a box.
5:11 i see nothing 🤣🤣
Expecting a main channel video from Simon where he renovates that home and gifts it to someone in Bulgaria now lol
How deadly annoying and brain sucking can a thumbnail get? Well, we can remain curious. RIP from germany
Nah I wanna know how tf JJ got tickets to Afghanistan for only 500-600??
Best episode so far lads 😂😂🔥
Nice video
That broken chair is a paid actor. I laughed so hard 💀
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecAnFHAxvtwOIVVVTK3cuQ
I feel offended about yall not knowing the currency of south africa
they’re all comparing items when every single one of them is rich enough to buy every single item in this video
Liking the videos but seriously does Eathan have to keep grabbing at his d1ck
Lol, bullets. I can't imagine going to the bank with bullets
Rip off mr beast fr
bro JJs face at 24:08 is absurd XDDDD
Yo Sidemen. I have a crush on your female photographer lady.  I liked since the first moment I saw her .
Hello mrbeast
Has Bez got an STI the way, he’s itching his bollocks?? 😂
I read semen not sideman
When they said what is the currency of South Africa is bullets had me dying (I’m South African)
I am so jealous of that Lewis Hamilton table 😫
I honestly dont understand y anyone wants to own 99% of these. Things like the bike and ninebot are dope but the ronaldo boot and all make 0 sense
5:10
I got a 2013 Mercedes f1 rear wheel coffee table for £800 a few years ago, not a championship winning year but at least they won a race with it😅
I keep noticing ethan scratch his below ;-;
What did Simon take out of tobies
32:00 Simon is so relateable - don't wanna choose but wanna win the game
Okay but what did Simon pick from Tobi’s box?
harry pulled 1000 IQ move by pulling that chair😂😂
Bullets as the currency of South Africa is actually crazy.
25:40 Did anyone else realise KSIs evil laugh in slow mo 😂
20:17

Next mario kart edit should be the new vancouver race track
Tobi is so nice telling Simon he can have anything from his box, that's a real one right there

sssssssssssssssssssssssooooooooooooo many ads omfg
Vikk....giving 10k worth of gold is like the most indian thing ever
Josh got the best box fs
Love from South Africa 🇿🇦 ❤, I'm glad Harry knew our currency
this video reminds me of old sidemen vids lmao. love the work editors
this is like storage wars lmaooo
So who got who's box? Vik got his own Harry got Josh Simon got JJ
I wish we had just the non blurred and censored versisons of these vids on Sideplus love the BTS but  'Sidemen Extra' with no cenoring would be sick! Espically the big episodes
Banger!!!!
Damn
9:51 Bog vs Behz at the end there literally made me cry out pound 😂😂😂
Harry and Ethan playing musical chairs was singlehandedly the best 20 seconds of content of all time
I like this video😄
So who opened whose boxes?
The way chair stealing 😂😂😂
pretty sure the keyboard for that old computer sells for a fair amount of money
I would want Vik’s box.
The faces when the baloon pops
U can get the Hamilton wheel table or similar things at f1authentics
U can't spell sidemen without semen
what is the name of that bike in the video?
we gonna ignore how toby perfectly pronounced that word?
Ethan need some cream for the itch
still waiting for the next video
5:12 whats ethan up to

The ticket to Afghanistan had me rolling
Radio activity and radiation are two different things, why did yall give that one to Vick
I have genuinely never seen Simon really loose so this was something different 100%
As a Bulgarian I am more then happy to welcome Simon in he’s new house
Ggggg
When was this filmed ? £325 for a wii? That's nuts lol
That bike is worth like 1000 pounds in sweden
I wish sidemen would shorten their vids ❤️

We need a Part 2 👇🏽
Is no one going to say anything about Ethan touching himself for half the video? LOL
Get in Bulgaria all the way.

Brudda these videos are absolute trash now
I'm so glad josh lost Musical chairs if I had someone go that slow to guarantee a spot I'd have pushed man on his face 😂
10:35 for the longest time I thought the lettering was stitches from his surgery
@sidemen should do a Collab with the samurai himself, CoryxKenshin

As a Afghan I welcome simon to our country 😂

If I see the million likes I´d love to see the video with 100k on each box
So which country Simon's gonna visit first? Afghanistan, Russia, Iran or Haiti?😅😅
JJ’s box actually wasn’t horrible, surprisingly enough.
Others: "Josh is old!"  Josh(while jumping up & down like a 9 y/o): "I got wet for a reason(×2)"
Let beta squad do the boxes and u open them
Should’ve*
Never seen this idea

Nice, we watched rich people gift each other presents. Great content
Pls we need it to get 1m likes 100 k version would be incredible
35:56 - harry casually just steals the gold
that bear was my dog
Imagine Harry stole from Vikk and just took the 10k gold coin
As a Bulgarian citizen, can i take the property? 😆
Has Ethan got crabs? All guy ever does is scratch his bollocks😂
Finally someone knows about us (Bulgaria) and we welcome Simon into his new modern home
Why do ppl like these morons
Hear me out. Get “Jamie Tartt” in the sidemen charity match. And get Ted Lasso as a coach
Bruh when JJ said “It’s one way by the way”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
Vik pretending he doesn’t know the answers
🤣
Simon can I have the ticket to Afghanistan
Banger Vid as always
Most amazing math I’ve ever heard
So sorry to be the grammar police, but please someone tell the editors that it's "I should HAVE stolen" not "I should OF stolen"
Top 10 Sidemen Sunday

Littt
I thought jj cosplayed as blackmail
Afghanistan took me out.🤣
25:35 see Josh’s bald spot 👴🏻
The sidemen should do a season of love island with all the members
5:10 Ethan's lacking yk
I would've been so gassed with Vik's box, gold 10k will always keep its value
Please bring back sidemen among us
Been watching these guys since 2010, wondering where my $100,000 mystery box is at? I mean technically if it wasn’t for me or people like me, they wouldn’t have this stuff?? Idk I guess I can continue waiting for my box ❤❤
So wait a sec, Simon got KSI’s Box, Vikstar got his own, Harry got Josh’s, Ethan got Harry’s, Josh got Ethan’s, so does that mean Tobi got Simon’s and KSI got Tobi’s?
Wait! What did Simon take from Tobi’s box?!
Simon need to go to Afghanistan now 💀 would make a banger video
We need to get this to 1m likes imagine how good that video would be
WHY DOES JJ's HEAD SHAPE MATCH  @Maasaiboys
Ethan man handled tf out of his junk for no reason right there omg
Josh and his box idea was top tier! Made the whole video tbh!
Harry deserves the box bro
Who got who’s box?? I’m so confused
HARRY'S IN PAIN FROM NOT STEALING FROM ETHANS BOX
Where can I find the shirt vik is wearing the style looks mint
Mr beast men
😍❤️❤️❤️
Why was Ethan grabbing his nuts at the start 🤣🤣🤣
29:31 true friend saves the awkward moment for bazinga
Fire vid
Tobis smooth saying the word and first try in the whole deserves appreciation
Y buddy in green shirt kept grabbing his stuff all on video he must b burning
Can I steal the ticket to Afghanistan please 😂 I haven’t been in like 5 years
Why can toby not do musical chairs
I love it when it's just the OG sidemen ❤️
Best vid in a while! Really enjoyed it
I love how Ethan calls harry his friend after he opened the box and not his colleague, how opinions can change In a matter of time
This is the fourth video.. I have noticed Ethan casually scratching his balls every now and then.. Dude what's wrong!!?
what is the thing blured in tobis box?
Wait why do they turn around when opening a box?
Vikk acting like he doesn’t care in every video recently - replace him with Randy
GET IT TO 1M LIKES❤
This time it’s not fair split the player if Toby gonna be on sidemen his brother have to be on the other team it’s truly not fair both in same team
I am from Bulgaria
Bro why is he not giving tobi 50 bro 😂 tbh that’s selfish
5:55 what’s that song in background? I always tried to find it what’s the name of that background song?
Can I have The Hustlers University Pass
Great video
Not hating but seeing vik not caring about anything anymore tells me he will be the first to leave sideman one day
ethan needs his balls checked out
So pleased for Josh and his box choice 🥰
jj cheating as usual lol
As a South african, im offended that they took so long to guess rand 😭💀
A moment of silence for the chair 😔😔😔
39:03 made me laugh so much
100k version next
DON'T FIRE JACKKKK LOL
Simon got violated through the whole vid and still ended up happy was jokes🤣
Shout-out to Sidemen from South Africa😂🎉🥳!!!!!
Loved this video ❤
I've decided that any time I need a laugh, I'm gonna watch Harry and Ethan play musical chairs
Bring the strength test again
Kinda glad Harry didn’t steal Ethan’s box,he would of broken that motorbike immediately 🏍️
Never seen Ethan so damn happy playing musical chairs😂
W Video😂
Vikmon❤
this is the best sidemen video this year
Vic throwing “statistically” out after every box😂
at 17:50 it sounds like he called ksi a N-word lmao
damn vikk seemed upset about simon being above 18🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'd be well happy with Ethan box
43:33 genuine question btw 😂
5:11 ethan chill man, why man grabbing his weiner 😂
1 10M + video in 14 😳
improvement 's ''
JESUS heard tobis prayers
If he goes to Haiti wish he could come back to england safe
I am sorry to do this but “I should’ve stolen” even if for the memes, this is embarassing
I should've NOT I should of
3:06
Why is one of the longest words in the world the name for the phobia of long words
Keep bringing back the forfeits!!
I want to go soooo bad but blue water shopping center is 4 hours away from me 😢😢😢
Drinking game: take a shot every time Ethan scratches his balls
Can anyone tell the name of song during musical chairs?
Simon was too funny this video
I really enjoyed it a lot when Simon kept in insta saying they will get bad comments I worried nah it's great and new
By the way Iran is bountiful
Member when they actually posted Banger content back in the days.     They've fallen off.
JJ cheated but whatever.
Welcome to Afghanistan bro 😂
the music at 42:30 is the same as that Nintendo DS game Imagine Detective.. i don't think anyone in this comment section would know but damn what a blast from the past
I'm not envious. Envy is a sin
I'm down to see the 1mil each mystery box
Jj buying four 1-way tickets to some very “luxurious” countries is hi
Quick question, why did Ethan set the ball for everyone ? He wanted to shoot that ball sooo bad ? right ? 😅🤣
Do this but 50k each
Ethan and his colleagues did a banger in this video🔥
its unbelievabel they choos so long word for fear of long words🤣
well im waiting for simon in moscow now i guess
Sidemen hide and seek in Simons Bulgaria house….?
5:11 i had to rewatch
Simon should visit his home in Bulgaria and probably make it little nicer as well
What’s wrong with Vik he’s like a depressed boy during all the video . He’s saying : Who cares?
We need a Sidemen tinder with AMP
Loved this one, i hope there will be more in the future!
05:10 ay yo, keep scratching ethan XD
Does Ethan have crabs or what? 5:10 , 6:38, 15:41 Is that the Warner Bros in Watford?
Cant wait for miniminter to visit bulgaria :D
Jesus is our saviour ✝
the math aint mathing 7 box cost 10k each which adds to 100k nice maths mate
This video restored my faith in the main channel 🤣🤣🤣

Seeing how much joy Ethan had playing musical chairs has warmed my heart so much. Go get it big guy.
Wow what a great vid between Colleagues 😂
So no one noticed Ethan scratching his balls ?😂 5:12
So what did Simon take from Tobi??
Tobi is increasingly disrespectful, especially to JJ. He also lied about getting his own box ... 😅
I would love to see another sidemen spend $100,000 on each other but in america this time
Dont joking about JESUS.
THE AD AT THE END!!! INSANE
Take out ID from SIDEMEN
5:10 dont think i didnt see that ethan

sidemen giving money to themselves again
Imagine copying the looks of mrbeast his tumbnail
I want one please
7 boxes, 10,000 each, equals 100,000. Thanks sidemen i had the maths wrong my whole life.
need to do the beanbag throws without the cornhole, makes it so much more scarier, but funnier when someones hit
I’m hoping there a bit confused about the size of the motorcycle because 50CC is tiny compared to that bike.
Am I the only one who noticed Ethan grabbing his sack when tobi opened his box😂😂😅
Harry was the perfect person to getting the cash since he loves money the most
https://m.youtube.com/@Purplemonks
19:21 Ethan caught JJ out with that little bit of context 🤣🤣
Nobody talking about the scene they forgot to censor the pp plush😭
PLEASE MAKE ISHOWSPEED VS 20 WOMEN THAT WOULD BRAKE THE INTERNET
This might be my fav sidemen video this year!
Ksi is just a L 💀
harry had a stinker on predictions this vid 😂
2:49 that’s a married man right there😮‍💨
43:50 "I have four tickets to Afghanistan"😂😂
The cornhole mini game gotta be made into a whole video bro😂😂😂
Are we guna skip tobi pun 😂😂
Vikk millionaire’s attitude is pissing me off tbh
Just taken that mrbeast thumpnail 1 to 1
Why they don't look before they open any vox?!!!

ethan caught in 4k at 5:11
Dogshit video
Petition for $100 vs $100,000 calorie challenge.
The steal from simon to tobi never happened So dumb wanted to see what he would steal
I’d watch a whole video of them playing cornhole like that
“i’m gunna take the telescope” crazy
Simons voice in the General Knowledge part was funny
I am from Bulgaria and good luck with that house
Eyo, Simon really coming at South Africa with that one, love it 😂
9:53 the broken chair part had me dead 😂
Pizza
I couldnt stop laughing like crazy when they were playing the throw into the hole game xD

Vikstar123 any chance I can have a gold coin
България! ❤️
This is video was so entertaining
Seeing Ethan happy makes my day ngl
I do enjoy how they act like 10k is not peanuts to them 😂
10k X 7 = 100K?!?!
My Fiancee wants to know why Ethan is always grabbing at his junk. She also requested he gets some kind of cream for that itch.
Sad how they basically took the piss laughing about the ticket to Afghanistan. It is a beautiful country that has become torn apart by war, they should be more mindful when filming ☺️
this is the sidemen i used to know, these type of videos were the best.
Vik is so annoying! “I don’t care” “I don’t want to play” blah blah, just have fun man
Ksi is a neek😂
The one way flight to Afghanistan 😂😂💀💀
danny arron’s 20 v 1
10x better than hide and seek
That general knowledge section had me crying 😂😂😂 harry too funny man
What a funny video xD
What did Simon take from Tobis box???
“miniminter in afghanistan “  can’t wait to see it
9:33 love this duo
Idea : Sidemen Last man standing  The last one in the box standing wins
Petition for mini minter to visit his new home and all his places from his box—->>
Who's box was whos
Im going to afghanistan pull up
This was brilliant. They need to work out how to change this up for another similar styled but different video.
WE NEED THIS SIDEMEN EPISODE AGAIN!!!
31:50 bro?
The way josh said im older than fifa😂
best video of the year by miles
How many times is Ethan gonna scratch he crotch 😂
What did simon from Tobi ???
Simon opening JJ’s box and not being angry and seeing the positives was so wholesome.
There's definitely a video to made by Simon about his new home in Bulgaria lol
Tobi’s picture 😂
More of this
simons box got me dead
Drink every time behz scratched his nuts Jesus Christ
i'm acc gassed Josh won that, Ethan's reaction was so sweet!
They are all millionaires lol these nothink to them haha
Harry looks fit
Ethan got an itch??? scatching his thing all video
BULGARIA❤❤❤❤❤
I love all the pictures they put on the boxes, Vikk’s got the giga chin and the rest are just memes 😂😂
Has Ethan got crabs?
9:50
31:00,34:30,37:37,43:58
i realy like this video
sidemen vs betasquad would be a nice vid
Wii 325?

I'm waiting for Simon in Moscow
all kenyans jeezz we up now
35:58 imagine if he used the steal on this box
Hey Come to Iran we will have fun together
I'm searching for a ticket to go to Iran and I can say that 438£ is a good price 👌🏻
14:56 - the timing of this edit was top tier, I’m cackling 💀😭🤣
5:10 hey HEY
The second Harry said Ethiopia🇪🇹(My Country)😊
The musical chairs with Ethan and Harry has to be one of the best sidemen clips ever seen. I was on the floor laughing at that carnage.
how are they saying a wii is 300 quid it's like 50.
didnt care for the challanges, just show the box. content too long and slow
15:26
Why are they Turning everytime they choose box
25:51 what is vik doing 😂
Ain’t a great video lads! Hopefully next week is back to bangers!!!
Just a question did i miss what simon took from tobis box.
do cockroaches have wings? BYEEEE 💀
South Africa's currency might as well be Bullets😅😂
Josh's reaction to the remote controlled airplane LOL 😭 22:28
If the sidemen make another one of this sidemen should add a another secret box that the camera crew bought and a special guess
The ticket to Afghanistan got me😂
I know the game isn’t talk about anymore but I think a Sidemen pokemon go video would be so sick. Something like “Sideman to catch the most Pokémons in 24H challenge”
I had to pause the video to make this comment, I laughed so hard at the musical chairs and genuinely thought it was funny and since they both cheated it was a fair end to it, but now I truly feel bad for Harry, he is always getting bad luck and mugged off by the others, I truly hope Ethan was a true friend and gave Harry the Go Kart and Driver at least from the box, especially since Harry is the biggest Go Kart enthusiast in the group and he has been getting into golf a lot lately, he deserves them from the box at least 😢😢 my heart actually breaks for poor old Harry in most of these videos 😢😢 but it does make good content 😂😂😂
One of the better sidemen sundays this year
100,000 each box
Ethan has to get new underwear, his balls have been more itchy than ever
That was the best game of musical chairs I've ever seen 😂😂😂😂😂
ym please like so they do it with the bigger budget
harry and ethan on the musical chairs was so funny 😂
a 100k one off this would be sick
who made the boxes that tobi and jj got
I take that ticket to Russia
8:11 😂😂😂😂😂
Ok hear me out. They need to do a video of them going to visit Simon's new house.😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
ofc simon gets JJ's box. Ksimon
10k each, 7 sidemen, how does that total up to 100k?😂
Whatever happened to outros?
I’d like to see sideman involve fans for videos like this
Indian guy puts 10k gold bar actually the best box anyone could have got
sidemen biggest trip to landfill challenge
Sidemen x AMP tinder irl just saying
After violating South Africa, Simon deserves the worst box.
Seems a bit odd for ethan playing with his colleagues
“I should of stolen”
34:00
So what STD does behz have? Scratchy scratch
naa thay be holding jj
Harry went through a roller coaster of emotions but I’ve never seen him happier than what he got in his box
Is no one gonna talk about Ethan scratching his nuts a lot….
What the hell is wrong with Ethan’s balls ?? 😂
Damn KSI cosplaying a blackmail
I love it when Simon is suffering he’s such a hateable person
Why do they turn around every time they choose a box?
Envy is a sin lol
why is ethan always scratching his balls
Royal mail sponsor?😅
I absolutely adore the recent editing!
12:45 Simon🤨🤨🤨
17:37 bookmark
Come to Iran man 😂
17:21 Tobi with the attempted dab save
Best sidemen video in ages
Are we just gonna miss "i should of stolen", rahhh
Sidemen > Nelk Boys  Beta Squad > Sidemen
The first sidemen video I've rewatched
If Harry got JJ's box,  he definitely travelling to all those countries and renovating his Bulgarian home
What did Simon take from Tobeys box?
Wait so if we get the likes to 1 million, they'll do a 100 grand box each. Bois let's get this to one milli
As a Bulgarian im waiting for Simon's visit to his new home😂
harry turned to mister crabs
Vik and Josh were smart 😂
Good video ❤❤❤❤❤
2:54 JJ couldn't resist
Pog
I love how every ticket was one way
This was a sick video. Basic concept, executed well.  Now time for @miniminter to do a house flipper irl series
Taliban will be thrilled to have simon in 🇦🇫. He only needs to grow some beards.
Is it just me or does Harry look slim af
Viks attitude of "i cant be arsed" for everything, during every video is getting abit annoying🤣🤣🤣
They are actually average 5m views now.. and this vid is a banger aswell!
Nah Harry should’ve given tobi something icl

Good to see Ethan and his colleagues work together as always!

1 million likes = 100k budget, everyone start liking the vid NOW
20:55 POV of Soggy Biscuit.
10:35 I just realised the Roman numeral tattoo on Ethan’s neck is Olive’s date of birth
Which Sidemen editor thinks it’s “I should of stolen” and not “I should have stolen” shocking behaviour
Kon is looking fresh
5:10 wtf is that 🌝
Imagine Harry stole from Vik's box😅. Leaves Vik with toilet rolls and takes 20k for himself😂
Hustlers university 😂
Does anyone know the name of the song that plays when they revealing the boxes? Been stuck in my head for a minute
actual banger
I really enjoyed this new video idea
I love the twist that JJ’s box brought 😂😂😂 I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time..
This Sidemen Sunday wasn’t what I expected in the best way possible. Really like how it turned out. it’s very creative as well.
this is now one of my favourite sidemen videos this idea is so good !! loved it
Simon asking for 50 quid killed me
icl i watched the whole vid just for the sidemen clothing bit at the end cus the music bangs
Road to 1mil likes
simon is on that irl houseflipper
41:43, 43:52
BULLETS 😭
Bring back sideman pub 2023
Can someone let me know why they had to look away once they picked their box?
Tobi at 42:35 “that’s the apple macintosh”💀😂😂
Nice to see Ethan hanging out with his colleagues
14:45

9:45
If Harry stole from Vikk’s box, he would’ve ended up with 20k.

31:51 shoutout tobi for not fumbling that word
Harry's excitement was so genuine and contagious !!!
We love for simon to come to Iran😂❤️

Banging video idea, Simon renovates his Bulgarian gaff. I hope it's coming soon!
One of the most original and entertaining videos !!
This was a sick video
arguably the best sidemen video ever👏🏼👏🏼
JJ doesn't put effort in sidemen videos.
36:27 learn from Vik guys, he can carry his spending everywhere 😂😂😂😂  Btw gold's value increases with time (mostly)

29:17 is that correct grammer?
Imagine KSI getting vikk's box 😂😂
I was expecting comments from a bunch of outraged animal rights activists mad about that bear  That is actually a pretty awesome piece Although I would’ve preferred the whole bear and not just the top half
I want that old computer Not gonna lie
5:11 is definitely going to be on their reddit
copied me beast
If josh hadn't cut two layers of balloons, vik would have won that round 😶
3:18 ksi looks mad jealous 🤣 ksimon still alive
My little 4 year old niece has one of those little hoverboard go karts

16:40
25:11 male puberty
We’re already a 1/3 of the way to making it £100,000 each. In one day, we can do this by end of week for sure
I just thought of something what if Ben Foster plays in the charity match?
2:45-2:50 i did a bitta extra zoomin in the video then. 🎉
A Sidemen escape room would be sick
What’s the name of the outro song
Get jj out
Fire dat guy man tf!
We definitely need a part two or have them make it into a series of some kind
why do they have to look away after picking the box
one of the best sidemen video ive watched this year!! genuinely the vibes were amazing this video..
Did simon get something from tobis box??
We NEED a 100,000 mystery box. Please
One way tickets😂😂😂🔥
Simon got violated, meanwhile Harry dubbed up
Video was based off chance but was so good it felt scripted. The fact that JJ's box was picked last and Simon was the one who got it was hilarious 🤣
I mean in a way JJ gave Simon new video ideas Id say he has the best box
Please stop it with the 2 unskippable ads
Harrys back to breaking chairs 😂😂😂
I LOVED THIS VIDEO!!!! THIS IS A BANGER
36:01 bunch of gold and Tobi decided to steal a toilet roll 😂
u should do part two but each sidemen is in their box and u have jme lux danny and more do it
What did he choose from Tobi's box?
Cheap version for Mr beast 😂
I said the how I met your mother reference then they started doing it 😂😂
Go watch squeezie the french Guy who do formule 1 with other youtuber we need a sidemen formule 1 with all the other england Guy like chunks please made them see that comment
Why does Harry keep playing with himself 😂
Watching them try to play cornhole was painful but funny

5:11 Hand looks a bit inappropriate around work colleagues
11:51 My birthday is the 15th, pls say happy birthday on the 15th
Love to see Sidemen recycling the boxes. Looks kinda expensive
This needs a part 2 really enjoyed it 25:35😂😜
-29:57 song please!
Quality video. Jj is so jokes man
Post box is delivering mail😂😂😂
Spread the gospel
Musical chairs was a historically funny moment

As a bulgarian resident I'm excited to invite simon into his new home.
Best video ever

Ethan needs to see a doctor about that scratching
Lowkey jj’s box aint bad 😂😂😂
The flight tickets were awful 😂😂😂
being from afghanistan, i really didnt expect the sidemen making for my contry like that, its sad because i have been a fan of the sidemen for so long.....
Josh is sick
Whats the chances simon got ksi’s box 😂😂😂
Vikk really got his own 😂😂😂
Kon is looking slim 💪
Just had to drop this here. That ishowspeed is close to getting above the sidemen in subs
if anyone else was curious this is who got whose box: tobi - simon ethan - harry jj - tobi josh - ethan vik - vik lol harry - josh simon - jj
The advert music at the end was coldddd
i need waterboy ksi back
BANGERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
simon always makes bangers fr
Sell me the derbi pn05vob
A part 2 of this video with a bigger budget would be amazing
14:53 LMFAO funniest sidemen edit I've seen
Heard holiday playing in some random store in new Zealand lol didn't know jj was that big
Beta squad better but sidemen cool
EVERY game Vikk just says "I don't want to be here, can I go home".  So ungrateful.
I have finished the video, but I believe the people on the right got the people on the left’s box:  Simon ———> Tobi Harry ———> Ethan Tobi ———> JJ  Ethan ———> Josh Vik ———> Vik  Josh ———> Harry JJ ———> Simon  Correct me if I am wrong
tambnail of the MR Beast Videos whaaaaat
5:00 where’s Ethan’s hands bro
Please do this again!!!
18:48 KSI sounds like vik
Tbh, everyone got gifts but Simon can make some cool videos out of all the tickets and stuff from there
all i would want is a iphone i got a iphone 6 XD
96 Fuckries during the musical chairs is so elite
Simon plz plz come to irannnn
I heard Bulgarian h0.0
Harry's face when the balloon was over him 😂😂😂
At the end of the day any box would of been good as your getting items for free✌🏻
As a South Africa, bullet was crazy 🤣
Whoa 😂 https://youtu.be/gnoJBpQDdBw
It’s one way by the way 💀 😂😂
We need Simon to go to Afghanistan 😅
I'm sad Vik picked his own box, he looked like he would have had more enjoyment watching someone else try and find the gold
As a Ukrainian, I'd love Simon  to throw a ticket to f***in russia in the toilet!!! But the video is the piece of art tbh)
poor don was about to bag 5k 😭
Vik was so excited about his box, I wish someone else got it
The ads are getting so annoying
best video ever
Why do con and tiesto look alike
Best one in ages
One of the beat sidemen videos ever 🔥🔥
The handle bars smacking Ethan 😂 No way harry broke another chair😭
Not the dude in the green shirt scratching his balls

the musical chairs was brilliant. never laughed that hard before
Hall Of Fame vid 100%
5:11 real
which video was this? i can't remember
I’ve never laughed on a sidemen video that much as I did tonight
How is a wii worth so much?
I love this video, it is a nice spin on spending videos.
They need to redo this video but choose fans to get the boxes
25:39 the water maintaining the shape of the balloon for a millisecond was so satisfying
lol
Vik did proper indian thing and bought gold bar 😅
Ethan having fun with his colleagues
Ngl, JJ actually had the most entertaining and creative box
بیاین ایران😂😂
Minikstar?
This is an absoliute banger video
$10,000 x 7 = $100,000??😂
God didn't want vik doin that for a reason
Joshua's box was a sick one just bc it had the cristiano boot and Lewis car table. Thats soo sick
Crazy that £10k gets me out of debt and changes my life yet to harry it's just an amount'
"ITS MONEY! YES ITS MONEYYY!!" lmfao harry
The sadness in Harry's voice on Ethans box
I think Faith has been unfaithful because Ethan was hella scratching his helmet full video 😂
yooo was that SLOWTHAI playing whilst them playing musical chairs????
Worst Sidemen Sunday of all time.
I feel like they’ve either lost a director, editor or producer.  Eva use this is shot terribly
Anyone else notice that they're all wearing white sneakers
What did Simon chose from Tobi's box tho? 🤔
Imagine just having £10k
If I don't see a Simon series titled "REAL LIFE HOUSE FLIPPER" where he does up his new Bulgarian house then I will cry
So this is what being rich is like-
Sidemen acting like they can't buy these and not affect their wallet
13:56 13:56
Are we ever going to find out what Simon picked from Tobi's box???
Do this again, this was lit🔥
How does 7x10000=100000
Can we have 20 vs 1 duke dennis
As a resident of South Africa I can say that out currency is indeed bullets😂
W VID
This was an absolute banger of a video
Waiting patiently for a Miniminter main channel video titled either ‘I Moved to Bulgaria’ or ‘My New House Tour: Bulgaria Edition’.
Whose box was the first one?
Does anyone know the song during the musical chairs
The musical chairs 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was a banger❤
the musical chairs finale was one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen
Banger video
😂😂😂
Great video guys
One of the best sidemen videos ever
When’s the house tour siman
What a great video! I really want to know what Simon took from Tobi
i love this video sm their vibes are amazing
I’m convinced Simon is a psycho 30:52
23,09
Vik’s statistics are completely wrong btw. Picking these boxes is identical to drawing without replacement which means the odds are interchangeable. In laymans terms this means that the odds of the 5th one being ksi’s box is equal to the 1st or the 7th one being it for example🤥
they say dollar but then say pounds immedialy after then say dollar again bruhh
Such a good video loved this and it was so funny😂👌🏻
2:55 Simon having flashbacks to when he lived with ksi
Oh my god.....Ethan and Harry's fight for a chair was amazing I couldn't stop laughing....still replaying it lmao😂😂😂😂
Every Sunday a banger from the sidemen 🔥🔥🔥🔥
why does vik never care in sidemen and moresidemen videos 😂
15:14 😂😂
we want simon to visit the countries he got tickets for and also the house!
God video, all though the hustlers university sub as a joke was very stupid. Cheap shot, with a stupid message from the KSI / Sidemen side.
Josh is always nicing harry whether he means to or not haha
This video should become an annual appointment 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I actually liked this video more than the others recently it was much more of a laugh and anticipation 😃👌🏼
7 * 10k = 100k
Loved this video!! more of this
afghanistan one way trip is crazzyyy
damn simon looks good
Thanks guys for yet another amazing sdmn sunday
This video was sickkk
Vik n josh really put the effort in making the boxes fun
300 pounds for a wii no f-ing way
Perfect
If I go to blue water can I get the ticket to Afghanistan. I want to go to Kabul to try their pilau.
Ethan was sus lol
Next sidemen video should be them visiting Simon's Bulgarian home xD
Did Simon forget to take an item from Tobi's box?
Best Sidemen Sunday in a long time!!!
One of the funniest sidemen videos in a while
the fifa one was easy in general knowledge
They should make a part 2 this is funny 😂
12:24 should've, should've, should've. Come on editors.
We need more videos like this
first box contains a throne, multiple over 2k items, sidemen basket ball a fuckin go kart n " its not a great box " 😂
Finally a sideman video with only sidemen
41:17 is the exact response 8 year old me had when opening Christmas cards
Why is nobody talking about the fact Ethan kept touching his knob
simon should do a house flipper irl with his new house .
bruh the mark rober music
How many time did Ethan scratch his balls??? 🦀 🦀
As an Afghan can I get the one way ticket to Afghanistan I haven't been home since I was 12
JJ casually trying to pay the camera man off
only thing i wanna know is what headphones Simon got if he got some sony wh-1000xm5, i will actually be gassed for him cus they r amazing.
Best video in some while
Tbh.. what a boring video concept. Almost no explanation and just the most random pick a box and that's it video. Boring
As an Indian I can relate to vik having gold in his box 😂, it's something really valuable to all Indians
Loved the video. Need pt 2 for this
All the south Africans wanting to kill Simon
L sunday sidemen🙂
Get this video to 1M likes for $1M dollar version cmon every1!
Vic was close with Mt Kilimanjaro, it's not in Kenya but we can see it from Kenya😊😊
this was a banger , unique , LOVE IT
i sworn myself to only simp for Harry for the rest of my life! juss becauz he is too funny
imagine Harry  stealing Vikstar's 10k gold instead of Ksi's telescope💀💀
That was an absolute classic game of musical chairs
Best vid in a while tbh 😂
One of the best lads for a long while
Mr.beast lite?
what was the blurred thing in the first box
The "Statistically best time" would be after KSI's box was already open technically given it isn't last
fuckin ethan will have bear grylls in his bloody house
JJ made a bad box knowing that Simon would open it. This must be revenge for the weeding. Genius😂😂
The ending got me in tears 😂
GIVE IT LIKESSSSSS 👍
this is the best sidemen video in a while lmaoooo
JJ man. Love that guyyy
😂😂
https://youtu.be/llaP7sLSsxo
1 mil likes come on
It’s all empty vikkstar🤣
Sick video again🔥
The bounce sound effects make me giggle
ethan has clap
The funny thing is Harry will just buy his own box again
poor ksi
Didn’t believe a wii is £325 just checked on Amazon and am genuinely shocked they cost that much now!
as a south african bullets sent me howling😭😭
This is one of the funniest sidemen vids of the year 😭🤣
This makes me think the sidemen need to do a sidemen Sunday based on Storage Wars
what in the mr beast
This vid ain’t it love y’all tho
5:11 damn Ethan doin a madness
Man said our currency is Bullet 🥲💔
Such a great vid one of my favorites
Only 15 mins in Harrys box is the best (Golf,Music and loads of cool things)
19:51
20:08 Harry activating the steal is like in Yu Gi Oh when they activate the spells and the traps lmao 😂
I actually like this they need too do more like this it’s brilliant they should do on the next one £10.000 worth of good stuff in the mystery box
Nah they just copy mr beast with some differences 😂
Won't get loads of views but I really enjoyed this as an original video idea
6:14 this is way people including me hate on the furfandom(furries/furry). Cuz of the yiff.
What's the currency of South Africa Simon: Bullets 💀
Nice
I am the only one who thought Ethan was bare awkward in this video😅😂🤣
Loved this so much, the challenges, the whole thing was awesome
17:21 does anyone know the name of the background music
That bear in Josh’s box is worth bear money isn’t it?
It's the fact that there all millionaires I swr so they can just buy it thereselfs 😂
Ayyyoooo Simon hahahahaha Please respect South Africa, Bullets as a currency is crazy LMFAO!!!!
Is that fnaf music in background of intro
copying mrbeast??
did Harry Say Ethiopia Please answer  Sidemen😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢please
Simon isn't to far off 31:20 😂😂😂
17:50 now thats a transition
36:00 Tobi stole a roll of toilet paper 😂
Why is Ethan always gripping 😭??
Sidemen be like: 7 x 10000 =100000 Makes sence to me
Harry literally crying when ethan got his box😂
This is possibly the most entertaining sidemen video I've ever seen. Would love to see more of these with varity (boxes with different values, more steals or whatever). Love it!
Wait so who’s was Tobi box? Tobi - ? Ethan - Harry Harry - Josh Josh - ? Vik - Vik Simon - JJ JJ - ?
15:11 Only Tobi and Simon appreciating the joke
guys 7:05
A sidemen storage wars would be a sick idea. I get this is similar but u should actually get a budget each and go out to storage auctions and see who can get the most profit/best items, would probably need to be in the us but would be good
Nah the 1 way ticket to Afghanistan is nuts 😭😂😭😂😭😂
100% need a number 2 of this
Genuinely one of the most entertaining videos in a while
This was such a cool vid ..after so long a classic which actually made me laugh!!!
Such a banger vid top 5 this year but its not gonna get views unfortunatly
Bullshit
What a banger!
the cornhole was the funniest part
JJ is such a cheater
the exact replica of the mrbeast thumbnail is insane lmao
i met harry today!! at aztech in guernsey supporting his sister in table tennis.
a part of kilimanjaro is in kenya so vik got that
25:41 Viks face🤣
5:10 what is Ethan doing lol
34:11 whats that song called?
i think the sidemen should definitely do a video where they have to design rooms and the winner gets a prize of some sort
why does ethan keep touching his wood lol
As a South African "Bullets" is a valid answer.
That Asus ROG Ally Simon got thooo
Bullets is crazy 💀
I don’t think there could’ve been a more fitting box for Harry
Bro the hustler university actually bomb. I can make 50 grand a month and not even pay for the Uni. SIGN ME UP
Whose video idea is this?
39:22 is such a good meme clip
33:00 josh I’m older than FIFA 😂😂😂 no s#*t bro
mr beast's idea though
24:30 JJ's reaction everytime bro😭😭😭
i’m sorry jj is a terrorist😭😭😭😭
43:48 This part got me on the floor😂
How tf did tobi read that phobia
32:00 That was such a funny voice 😂🤣
PLEASE do a sidmen vid of making a cabin in bulgaria
This is a good videooo ❤
https://youtube.com/shorts/IBvmU5V23-I?feature=share
Viks box was elite
video defo better than what i expected from the title
why Ethan keep scratching his d
Another dub in the kitty. Keep it up, lads. This is your forte.
Hustlers university 👀👀👀
9:35 Genuinely. Watching these two fight over the chair made me laugh so hard my heart started hurting
I don’t think I’ve ever seen Josh this gassed in a video
think ethans got a std keeps scathing his corey
bro ist mrbeast
!!! soo good
Vik gave and received the most valuable box
Simon has to make a video going to those places 😂😂😂😂
Being south African when they send the currency is bullet I was so surprised coz that is my surname The correlation was crazy
Jj pushed Tobi from getting the bad box and Tobi won😂
how do i like a video twice
harry stealing the chair from josh was a cold moment (with the glasses as well 🥶)
9:54 was the best part of the video 😂😂😂
Ethan having some fun with his colleagues
😂the video is 10x better when they themselves are having fun
So many ads man
Viks gold box is constantly increasing in value, vik is a money man
What did Simon choose from the Tobis box?
What is the outro song called?
Ginger stop playing with yourself
Viks villain ark should never end
1 million likes and it’s 100000 each box everyone
5:12 Ethan doing madness down there💀💀
Who got whose box? Does anyone know
One of the only videos shot indoor that i love
Harry and Ethan playing dirty in musical chairs was hilarious
such a refreshing video. old school Sidemen + bigger scale. amazing!
Can someone tell me how can I get the after credit sidemen clothing music beats
Great video once again from Ethan and colleagues
Does anyone know the bgm when Vikk opened his Chest??
Simon never stole the item from Tobi’s like he could’ve
3:55 flew over so many heads😂😂😂
I beg i see a video soon where yall go to bulgaria to fix up that house
The video editors need to be paid so much more.  The memes are so subtle and hilarious 😂
Bulgariaaaaa!!!
Easliy best sidemen Sunday for a long time
Imagine how much better it would have been if JJ's box had had actually been good instead.
Simon is back, pog
The concept of this video is a big upgrade from the classic hide and seek. Not saying I don’t enjoy the hide and seek but it’s getting a bit repetitive
best sidemen sunday in so long
if harry had stolen vik or joshs box he would have got full 10k ahhaa
Simon needs to make a video going to visit his Bulgarian home
Your fiancé is a lucky girllll - Simon 😭😭😭
This is such a sick video!
https://youtu.be/49A4URvL4U4
KSI bad box made the tension and video exciting.
So good
I’ll have the hustlers university subscription
When's part two coming out.
U need to come afghanistan 😩❤
Over 3 bills for a wii 🤔
Loved this Video!! Sooo funny!!
Wtf..  just how many ads do I have to watch this is my 8th ad I'm not even in the halfway seen
Yo
Harry and Ethan playing musical chairs is incredible 😂
I was like this vid will be dogshi but this was fire ngl
We need another one
My best sidemen video
vikkstar is so awkward he shouldnt be in the sidemen
Dead video
Corn hole was literally one of the funniest things Ive seen all year
Bulgaria 🇧🇬
i love seeing ethan have a laugh with his coworkers
This was so good would love to see a second one of it really entertaining
So why do they turn round after someone has picked
ayo kon lowkey looking good these days man
14:55 cant stop my laugh😂😂
should have filled that baloon w/ horse semen
Really good video! Couldn't stop laughing 😂
31:48 ayoo ethan that's a bit mad😂😂
w video better then hide and seek lol
Josh getting more excited about the squashies than anything else was just incredible 😂
Ethan bro get a bore kit for the 50 cc make it a 70 cc , get better sprockets and carbs….. will fly mate
'This postbox is sus' 😂
Much love from kenya vikkstar123
good vid lads
What an absolute banger of a video
Very creative loved IT
As a Bulgarian i wouldnt recommend moving to Elhovo Simon 😂
5:14 wtf ethan doin LMAO
why is ethan scratching his bannana a lot ? Get off the screen and itch
Why do they turn around? Aren't the boxes already filled?
Can I have to ticket to Iran, I would like to see my family this summer
Vik and Josh really suprised me, those boxes and the idea behind them is so gold. Damn this is so good Sidemen Sunday, If this doesnt go top on a Sidemen Sunday tier list, i CBA😂😂💀
Gotta replay the musical chairs again and again
WHAT A FKN GREAT VIDEO GUYSSSS
They should do a DIY SOS video at Simons new Bulgarian house 😂
Probably one of my favorite sidemen sundays! This was so much fun to watch. I hope this becomes a series, especially with featured youtubers.. mr.beast?? I hope this continues! Very well done!
if i was harry i would take the poker table
37:00 broo i am dead😂
I feel sorry for Simon and Harry
Bez owes me a new phone. I dropped my bloody fone because of that freaking ball he shot.
What shoes has ksi got on? Air forces? I thought he was with Adidas. Surprised as he didn't chuck the Nike socks away
The cornhole game was the funniest thing I've seen in a bit I was dyiiiing on the floor 😭😭
lmao ethan saying ksi deserves lashings is crazy
Nahh man. I need more of this!!! This is banger!!! 😢 please part 2!!!
does anyone know where i could get harrys shirt?
Lmao bro won a one way ticket to Afghanistan 💀
We need to get to a million LIKES
This is fine content❤
Is the chairs in a line a British thing??? It makes no sense. Should the chairs not be in a circular formation???
banger
JJ seeing Simon get zesty, his intrusive thoughts took over
Kilimanjaro is on the Tanzania-kenya border... I totally understand harry's confusion
Really with the balloons vik should have got the turn
Come on guys get the likes of this video to 1 million because part 2 is even more interesting
29:35 editing mistake
Hope we get this 1M likes for £100,000 per box 🙏
Not gonna lie one of the top best entertaining videos on this channel keep spreading joy guys
The tickets to all the war country’s had me crying 🤣🤣🤣
disappointed that sidemen are against bribery, lost my respect
We need this but reddit chose what to buy for them and forfeits will be in the boxes and if they won't make it they have to give the stuff to thr crew
Can we appreciate how much effort vikk put into his
jj always ruins everything
12:44 ksimon going strong
Bog and Ethan playing musical chairs was the best thing I've seen all year
Class  shame they won't let my little channel advertise
No way harry is ever going to use the telescope
Ethan and harry fighting to sit on the chair was hilarious 😂
Ive enjoyed this video more than I have others in a while honestly
the plane tickets ahahaha
Honestly one of the best sidemen videos ever
the fact that jj bought him only one way tickets and no back ones is mad
Low Key, this is one of the better videos we've had in a while. Im dead🤣
This video is golden plus the editing of the football with JJ’s face on it tops it
I don't see why Harry always has to be upset just because he didn't get to screw over his friends out of getting the best thing for himself what kind of logic is this that they are all playing with for each one of them only does the same joke every video I guess
unfortunately he won't come to IRAN 😂😂💔
We need a Part 2 🔥
Fianally a sidemen video that I enjoyed after some time this was a banger super funny it felt soo short 😂❤️
Best video since the last roast in my opinion
23:00
I think Josh's idea was the winner for me, but overall great fun really
What is Ethan always scratching himself it’s so gross
one of the best videos in a while 🔥
5:10 is no one going to point this out?😂😂
Literally every single video I don't even want to put a period In between those words because of how serious I'm being but every time something good happens to Toby he instantly has to throw out wait I don't like this
I can’t🤣🤣🤣
was anyone else just so happy to see Josh’s reaction to his box
Seriously delete those first 3 seconds
Can't wait for Simon's vlog in Afghanistan
They are washed.
Finally a decent video
Harry saying i activate the steal 20:07 is the most autistic thing i've seen him done  😂😭😭
👏
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 The musical chairs sequence was nothing short of pure class
Oh my God, the best video in history, really
good stuff
funniest video in a long time😂
Absolutely mental that they all dodged the bad box til last
Nice
As a South African, I found Simon's joke at 31:18 offence but so funny at the same time. So props to Simon for the great joke
18:15 god dyamm kon's ripped
This vid is definitely the best one of all the vids that have come out recently
Can anyone explain why they face the wall after the box is picked?
Banger vid
This video needs to win an award  the best youtube video i have ever seen 😎👌
Wait so what did Simon take from Tobi’s box???
Vik fully goes in on JJ now in every video he just goes for him
Harry’s reaction 😂 24:54
As a South African, that question threw me off and I said "cent" with so much pride😭😭😭
Good video! i liked it
Harry and his glasses 😂
Sidemen will always be greater than Beta Squad
Banger
Waiting for the video where Simon renovates his Bulgarian Home.😂
😂😂😂😂
This was awesome! Defo 100k each box next one
Simon got jj's box,imagine my shock. It is written in the stars man....😂
This video BANGS 😂 Please do it again!
do a collab with storror
Everyone just gonna ignore Ethan itching his balls every 5 minutes 😭
Yall need islam
This is absolute gold!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
def need a part 2
We need a house tour in Bulgaria for sure 😅
This one of the best vids in last year or 2 on god this is goated vid an the blind folded corn hole thing was fuckin hilarious
As an afghan if Simon go to Afghanistan i will go there as well just to see him and believe me Afghanistan have very beautiful places❤
Whose box that jj & toby got,does jj got toby' box & toby got simon's box?
I mean at this point they are just gifting themselves shiz. wow
Ethan looks like he is having a tough time at work with his colleagues!
What a banger video
Ministar was born today
good concept! great video! NEED A PART 2
Why always ethan grabs his balls
More of these!
Is vikk about to leave sidemen?why is he like who cares?who cares? in every challenge.
Hilarious
harry doing the jorginho run up for the penalty killed me, the reason he does it is so he can see the keeper move first then he shoots the other way, but tobi isn’t exactly gonna start diving😭
this is one of the best videos, one way tickets is gold JJ!
🔥 video I’ll definitely watch this again.
one of the best sideman video ever
18 hours ago
They should do a christmas edition instead of their normal secret santa videos
Vik’s box would’ve been sick if someone else got it 😭
I know it’d be boring but I’d quite like a sidemen Sunday general knowledge quiz. Might be more suited for moresidemen though.
Thank goodness this video has no guests, I was now really tired of every sidemen Sunday with the annoying guests.
17:22 Why he dab tho
Good sidemen video well done lads 👍👌👍👌
Ethan really needs to stop grabbing his balls every 5 minutes and stop being such a sore loser
WE WANT MORE OF THIS
I need more videos like this to live istg this was amazing
Not stolen from mr beast
As a Bulgarian, I am happy to accept Simon into our country 😂
My stomach hurts from the chair breaking 😭😭😭
Josh for the best box easily
We need a video at the bulgarian house 😂
This was a banger, tha last videos have been L’s
That’s gotta be one of the best ones this year 🎉
Ethan and Bog😭😭😭😭
Nah JJ’s box was jokes 😂😂😂😂
32:00
This video is actually a banger 😂
JJ has a stylist all for him to wear black socks with white trainers 😂😂😂😂
Ethan scatching his balls in every scene made me angry af...
Minter got KSI's box, how poetic 💀
The edit of Simon getting hit with the driver
Big day for white shoes

haha toby trying to dab to defend the goal haha
😊
This video is brilliant
hj
Great video idea!
Dollars??, they’re in England…

3:28 bruh what am i watching this whole thing is like 20 ayos
Viks a proper sausage like
I wasn't able to take JJ seriously in that out fit man 😂😂 This vid Is jokes
I enjoyed this!
Can someone add subtitles 😂
The whole Sidemen team and crew are killing it with the new games and concepts for Sidemen Sunday! 🙌🔥 Used to avoid watching long videos but I'm loving the recent ones. 💯
Really fun video!
Sick! Surely more of them
This is one of the best ones
josh pushing 40 btw
Absolute banger
Ethan constantly playing with himself since the start of the video lol and no one noticed?
Simon, the man with everything got nothing. Love the balance
What’s the point in this video sorry, like what’s the goal loool
Why is Ethan always scratching his coco
This wasn't top tier
96 fuckries 👌
We need more of this
Simon next video be like doing up a house in Bulgaria that JJ bought me
teq za kvo sa mi kupili kushtata na be
The one way trip got me cracking up 😂😂
vikk's box is like flexing how rich he is. that was a good box btw
hustlers university and afghanistan, russia and iran tickets a fat W. ide take it.
Please stop doing hide and seek. These kinda videos are more exciting and entertaining❤❤❤
Ayo Kon loooookssss fitttt
Another terrible video. The emphasis is completely on wealth and there is no more humour to be found.
can we get the sidemen go to bulgaria and renovate the house please
musical chairs and such must be a more sidemen video.....
banger
Low key that IBM PC is goated.
Harry sounding like Mr krabs
Coming soon from Simon: surviving and escaping Afghanistan
That south africa joke was so offensive btw
another great sidemen sunday with ethan and his colleagues
This video was a lot more entertaining than I thought it was going to be 🤣 Well done lads!
8:10 lol
Vik giving gold soothes the souls of the Indian Ancestors 😂
banger bro
Simon's energy was different dis vid...
Lol, how the turns table...
Everyone focusing on the items  Meanwhile harry - "does cockroaches have wings??"
Simon actually got the best gift: a main channel video visiting his house in Bulgaria
Ethan touches his **** way too much
They should definitely do this again, perhaps let other youtubers make the boxes
I mean, what did Simon get from Tobi's box?
This was a 10/10 video
What did Simon pick from Tobi's box though
Ethan just constantly touching his c*ck 😂😂
Outstanding video!!!
Josh got the perfect box for him thats wholesome
Kick Simon from the sidemen
Peak sidemen
8:10 had me lol
Ethan saying ksi deserves lashes is crazy
At the end of Vik's box does Tobi hide a roll of toilet paper under his shirt? lol
I did not like being in that pov
One of the best videos in a long while
absolute banger
Awesome😊
Makes me feel poor
Sick video
all misses no hits past 2 weeks
This was the coolest fckn concept. I need more man this was top tier
The funniest video in a long time
I’d personally say Harry’s box was the best 👌❤️
banga vid
Get it to a million likes
Now this again but 50-100k lol
So is everyone just ignoring Ethan at 5:10 ??? 🤣🤣😭
Banger Vid!!!
I laughed so hard at the musical chairs 😭
What did simon chose
I think this is my favorite sidemen Sunday video this was amazing
why are they acting like they cant buy this stuff themselves though
this video was fun!
What did Simon choose from Tobi's Boxxxx ???????
We definitely need another part of this concept. Like maybe guests will buy for the sidemen
Nah ethan didn’t even deserve to win musical chairs Harry sat before him but Ethan broke the chair😂
32:13 lmfao at harry 🤣💀
100k one next, make the box big enough for a car 🤣🤣
Some one has put a hell of ads in it bro
But what did Simon pick for Tobi's box?
W video
They all actin like they couldn’t just buy themselves all these things if they wanted them that bad 😅
W
So dull man, who came up with this one
Musical chairs 😂

Great vid!
JJ being the richest but still willing to pay 5k for a good box😂😂😂makes me laugh
Hustlers University...like Andrew tates BS
Volkanovski did him dirty .He is great  but volkanosvski is just beast
Musical chair what a lovely game 😅
44:56 BAHSBSJSJSJKS 😂😂😂
This video seems very familiar. (Mr beast)

2:26 KSI looks soo autistic

This video was a banger, how is only on 2.7 million views in 15 hours? Has to be a glitch
Im pretty sure the biggest joy Ethan ever had was that musical chairs round

37:49 lmao
33:18 nah the editors are on another level boss😂😂
YES WE NEED 100K PER BOX‼️‼️
<3
I liked those video, only cause ksi won a challenge. 🥳😂
I wish I could play musical chairs with my employees...
NOW CAN'T WAIT FOR FREYA TO REACT TO THIS VIDEO ❤❤
Sucha banger man
Everyone like this I beg for a part 2
Bro 1 way ticket to afghanistan is mad😂
Btw if ur celebrity froends cant get the time to watch 2 hours of content it dosent mean ur audience doesent i want 2h sidemen vidoes back
Was a fuckin banger!
How many times did Ethan scratch his private areas? 😆He's not even discreet doing it XD
We need a part 2 cause this was a banger!!
Hate that jj is supporting a scam like buskers university but damn was this video good
What did Simon secure from Tobi's box ?
37:22 Simon got Slumped
29:38 was waiting for the edit team to forget 😅
2:53  Slaves try to get revenge on owner - around 1862, colorized
As a South African I feel offended as for bullets 😂😂
what item did simon choose from tobis box?
Amazing video
.
Fatneek Is a Racism Loser! By Cheating Before Hand B**** N**** He shld Be Fined .
this is a certified classicccc
im zooted and that mario kart added got lmfao and fell off my chair XD
So, 7 boxes and each sidemen has 10k to spend = 100k?
Kon looking slim yano well done🙏
Why did they have to turn around and look away every time? Were the boxes not filled yet or something? Or did i miss something? 🤔
can we just appreciate kon's fresh buzzcutt <3
Vikkstar showed his inner Indian to everyone with gold. That's an investment there guys!
KSI face when opening the box😮😮😮😮😮 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Uhhhh simon didn't get anything out of tobis box lmaooo
3:10 spit on me daddy jizzle
this was surprisingly entertaining, I hope we get a part 2 one day
just had a constant smile on my face all way through this vid
Editors are illiterate. Its “should have” not “should of”. English isnt my first language but even I know that. 😢
2:54 😭😭
I'm from South Africa. And the SA joke Simon made about bullets was Fing funny. Well done on that one.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Imagine Harry using his steal card on Vic’s box
I like the new video ideas the sidemen are coming up with instead of repeating stuff
In a turn of events, Vik getting his own box was in turn the worst one there 😂
as a iranian citizen im thrilled to welcome simon to Iran and show him around
ngl this was a banger video
gonna need to see what they can buy with 100,000...what JJ can buy with 100,000
Viks box was so underwhelming ngl 😂
ksi actting like he cant buy everything he  wants lol hahahah
Indians and their love with gold😂
Who tf is watching this anymore
This vuds a banger up there as the best kf the year so far
The math aint mathing  Each is given 10k And it totals to 100k There are only 7 sidemen how???
whos box did jj get
Vik was right it is partly in Kenya
This had me laughing all the way through and the editing (even for the ad) had me spitting out my coffee
Simón needs to go to Bulgaria
close to a new favourite sidemen sunday
I loved this video but would have liked maybe a 10 minute segment of each one purchasing and setting up there box
Ethan suffering from some major crotch rot, every shot he's scratching away down there
sidemen fell off they aint getting views like they used to
Now Simon has to go to Haiti, Afghanistan, Iran & Russia and then rebuild his house in Bulgaria  That video would be some great content
Good investment by vikk.
Banger
W VIDEO
Run it back 1 more time damnnn
banger vid
Banger
31:18 I live in South Africa and hearing Simon say "Bullets" had me rolling 🤣
guys let's get this to a million likes.. we need to see a 100k mystery box version of this 🤗
I’m so glad that sidemen are doing more educational content recently. 7 x 10k = 100k 😢 I’m learning so much
Simon was violated during the corn hole game 😂😂😂
damn I love this video so much
This video is freaking epic ❤❤
Kon is looking great, respect
Harry using steal is gold
My favourite video of the year
This video was so so good, had me rolling most of the time. Also I love how Vikk and Josh still thought of getting more content out of their boxes, with the treasure box and briefcase. And big props to editors, sick job
5:12 what is ethan doing
Vik choosing to buy the gold is such a indian thing to do!
“I might need some of that lube then”   KSI.
When Josh went to open his box that was cool❤‍🔥
U cant doo that
Bro we needa 1,000,000 likes asap 🎉
Naaa what did he take from tobis box
Fair play chipfat for keeping the thing blurred the whole time
I neeeeeed that massage chair!
This needs to get to a million likes guys 😂
Dude literally got the jock itch 😅
These mfs deadass copied mrbeast’s thumbnail
This needs to hit a Mil likes 😭

Wii's aren't worth over £100, let alone over £300 😂
2:18 bookmark
simon didn't even steal
Ethan do be grabin his crotch 24/7
5:10 WTF is Eathan doing with his hand LMAO BTW good vid keep them up
Sidemen without guest is the best!
Harry is going to be so gutted he didn’t take that electric bike; I have one and they can reach 30/50mph 🤣
JJ trying to cheat with money is so his persona😂
Getting gassed over a motorbike that does about 35mph
Ethan u ok fam?? Man’s moving like he gots 🦀🦀’z
Vikk is about to get married and got himself some gold, that’s the most indian thing ever 😂😂
I swear to god if they just returned all of that I would be pissed.
5:11 Ethan is gripping his meat like crazy
Harry constantly breaking chairs😂😂😂
Simon didn’t even chose from Tobi’s box
We need more of this 😂
Hoping for a moreSidemen video of everyone buying the content of their boxes 🤞
Another one!!
Love the vid but why’s harry acting like he can’t just buy any of this 😂
Don't get me wrong but was a good sidemen Sunday video, but it would of been nice to see the Lads actually buying the gifts for the mystery box's, why is it in $'s when the prices in video are in £'s, still was a good video
Soo its either SimStar or Starmon.
This is such a banger video!
Simon - Tobi Harry - Ethan Tobi   - JJ Ethan - Josh Vik - Vik Josh - Harry JJ - Simon
Is harry losing weight?
5:10 have a shower daily y'all
eyyy welcome to bulgaria, Simon hahaha
i love vikkstar
Best vid of the year
lol, shout out to the South African Rand😅 🥳
the variety in the boxes was actually pretty cool. as much as i like the gold and the money one. overall i think jj got the best one. the bike and telescope would be alot of fun to mess with
yo KSI's box is hilarious XD
As a South African citizen, the currency question got me rolling laughing
The outro goes hard man
Poor Simon
Its funny how harry has so much money and he’s upset that he didnt get his box as if he cant just buy that stuff anyway 😂
which box was tobi's and simon's?
Come to iran habiby
Scuff Mrbeast  vid
Tobi a real one for the daps
AYYY letss gooo BULGARIAAAA!
How many times has jj featured in a sidemen video is crazy
Damn just imagine if Harry decided to steal the box vik or josh's gift was in , damn that would be like the one and only reward gone lol
When tobi steals the toilet rolls HAHAHA
THISS VIDEO IS A BANGERRRR
Sidemen sunday at the bulgarian house?
simon enjoyed it
I like how Vik just straight went to his Indian traditions and bought a bunch of gold
Absolutely love this style of Sidemen Sunday, keep up the amazing work
Banger video

KSI is a knob-head his box had the most laughs🤣🤣🤣
This is such a Banger
36:09 anyone else heard "good  old fashioned game of pornhub?

This feels like the first sidemen video in a while that actually feels like a sidemen video.
ethan always make sure that his balls are still with him XD
Great video 👏🏽❤️
Ethan is my hero🤟🏼❤️😂
I love this video hahah!!
The musical chairs>>>>>>>>>>>

As an afghani I would love to welcome Simon here
Loved this vid
Simon acts like JJ’s dad 😂
GOOD VIDEO IDEA
Love this! Something fresh
did harry really just guess that they switched from the star rating to likes in 2017? or was it 2007 cause aint no way he actually thought that 😭😭
7x10k doesn’t equal 100k 😂😂 but love the vids
Does anyone know where i can get vik’s sidemen shirt?
Hilarious u
Nah this sidemen fall off is unreal🤣
Blud straight up modified mr.beast's thumbnail
Simon and Ksi romance still hitting strong I see
Nice time with the colleagues Ethan
We want this series
5:11 ethan scratching his balls
Ronaldinho?????!$ 12:46
One of the better sdmn vids in my opinion. Looking forward to the 100k one! 🤑
My birthday is on July 15 and your store is opening July 15😂😂I love the sidemen
Every video confuses me from the start
Harry v Ethan it’s jokes bro😂😂
Y'all should visit East Africa 😀😀😀❤️❤️
25:39 Nice slow mo there
At 14:55 the editor>>>>>>>>>>1÷0
KSIMON still lives ❤❤
No shout out to mr beast is crazy his thumbnail with jjs face and no credit it wild
Give that hustler university to me
This was an awesome video! I wish I could give soooo much more likes. I loved it!!
Who else watching this while absolutely cunted
As with the meme Olympics, its a nice change of pace from the regular videos and we would love to see a it on a GRANDER scale
next one try to guess the person who bought the items lowkey
Before I watch the video, I really hope simon gets the bad box 😂
hands down one of my favourite videos
Musical Chairs and Simon getting the most useless box killed me 😂😂😂
greatest vid this year
The images of the sidemen keep on getting more and more cursed i swear
The thing is that if i be in a video there and get a box i would just sale everything and just keep those squashies..
genius idea
Vick stay acting like a little teen😂 get that foo out the vids
7x10k isn’t 100k???
Ethan adjusting his balls at 5:10 is just so relatable
The LH steering wheel is awesome, I didn’t know they sold for $4k, way less then I thought
Amazing video laughed most the way through.
The chair breaking literally sent me
Harry looks so good in this vid
As a Haitian Welcome to Haiti Simon
The Colleagues! 🔥💯
Anyone that can explain to me the joke Simon made at 20:57?
Sidemen price is right...please
Harry looks so good here, props to him. Also the glasses actually look good on him and no one pulls those off.  Geez I just saw kon, he is looking amazing too, in such good shape!
Greetings from Bulgaria

Absolute classic
Can’t wait to see Simon’s Iran, Afghanistan, and Haiti vlogs 🥰🥰🥰  Also the home tour in Bulgaria!!

Stinker vid! we need more Trips and Hide and Seeks! @sidemen

Best Sidemen Sunday in a while! Laughed the whole time!
If it were me I wouldn't mind picking any box . I'm broke. Lol🤣
This was a sick video, should definitely do it again
I like the music in the background when the video is done, and they jusf advertise the Sidemen clothing, the music goes like this: "vikk, vikk, vikk, vikk, vikk, vikk"
14:56 MAD
31:49 could we appreciate that toby could actually say this word
Banger of vid
Ksi's fit is dead
14:56 Whoever edited this needs to chill 🤣
The more I watch the sidemen the more I realise that I could watch a series of behz and Harry just doing anything and spend my whole day laughin
Harry lookin slim brotha
Video idea for Simon is him seeing his home in Bulgaria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1rOsACs7DA
31:06 harry...
What a banger of a video lads❤
Always tell harry not to use telescope in the morning
This video was jokes. Just wish it had the shopping bit. Half the fun and content is seeing them shop for the things

PT2 PLEASE
The rainbow road edit was nice
Anyone else notice Ethan scratching himself a little too much?
Can we get a round of applause for the editors? They knocked it out of the park on this video 🎉
❤️
I thought this was a Mr.Beast video 🤣
I rewatched harry breaking that chair at least 6 times 😂
Nah how they not gonna out melmon animation in with the ‘hi again it’s me’ from Simon 😂
Ethan laugh is contagious i love that man😂❤
I must say Ethan and Harry are treat to watch Behz and bog duo is amazing i just love when they are together😂❤
can we just talk about Ethan groping himself on 5:13🤨
The musical chairs part was the funniest thing I've seen all month. Thanks boys for providing such amazing content for free.
50 grand each box next 😅
When Tobi put a couple of toilet paper rolls under his shirt got me dying lmaooo 36:01
Whens the next holiday?
37:24 what a shot 😂😂
JJ was air bombing the beanbags😂😂😂😂
Awesome video idea! Need another one!!
12:26 *should've
When JJ realizes he has a chance to get his own box is actually so excellent
5:11 eathans hand
the musical chair part is hilarious on 2x speed
JJ’s plane tickets 😂😂😂 one way!
I don’t think musical chairs has ever been that entertaining 😂
W vid
Harry vs Ethan in musical chairs was too much I laughed so hard that I cried and nearly fell off my chair
I loved this video!
Vikk completely misunderstanding statistics was funny.
nahhh I can't believe Simon actually picked JJ's box. KSIMON is real confirmed
38:44 Tobi coldest moments 🥶❄️
37:35 Poor Harry lmaooooo
Josh was so proud of the letter joke
W for harry🤘
Great video
JJ Purposely hurting Simon for marrying Talia and not him.
This is one of the most good videos in the Sidemen

Banger Sidemen Sunday 🔥🔥
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I LOVE THIS VIDEO
Shoutout to the team behind the scences! The editing of this video is ELITE!
Good video Brothers , simon is cringe
Bullets is not far from correct this country is done....
Next sidemen Sunday: “visiting Simon’s home in Bulgaria”
A part 2 to this video with a bigger budget would be awesome, especially because of how creative vik and Josh were
34:24 😂😂
kon is looking good!!!!!!!
32:20 he said 2017 what?
Miniminter got lucky 😂
Fire the crew. I wanted to see jj suffer. Atleast for few seconds
What is the JME song during musical chairs called?
30:48 cold
They forgot ads again
How do I get the shirt Harry is wearing
Drop likes so we get another guys!
29:43 new character: general knowledge
Song 15:55
29:40 why simon got one
What did Simon take from Tobi?
28:36 harry just checkin
Best one was musical chairs 😂
16:23 "JJ who's the goat? " JJ:
Been awhile but safe to say…..Banger
What did Simon get from Toby’s box?
this was THE best Sidemen Sunday Ever!!!!!!!!
14:54 This is one of the best editing moments of all time. 🤣🤣🤣
"GENERAL KNOWLEDGE"
12:03 "Hi again, It's me."
ngl i looked at the title and thought this was gonna be a stinker but this was a really good vid imo
JJ gave simon video ideas
These kind of videos are always fun. + even more fun when I don't listen to the rules to start with.......Buuuut I like old sidemen more, so maybe not that much views from this?
Josh smashed the box choice, it was like it was meant for him frfr
MinimintStarr ❤
This video was so funny 😭
31:49 ayo ethan🤨🤨 Tobi got violated
Their videos are honestly so entertaining. Crazy how they always come up with these ideas.
Simon going to his new home would be a good video idea 😂.
WOAH son looks really good wtf
20:09 lmaoooo why was Harry steal soo epic 😂😂😂😂
12:14 harry didnt steal two good crates in a row 💀💀
Ethan grabbing his crotch a lot at the beginning 🤔
i neeed harry's shirt omg
10:00 thats what harry gets for callin josh fat 🤣🤣🤣
What did Simon take from Tobi
The plane tickets jj had in his box has me crying
take a shot every time Ethan touches his balls on camera
😂😂😂😂
Harry acting like he can't afford to buy everything in Ethan's Box
What is a South African Pound bro
Good video
I've never laughed as hard as I did when Simon went through his box. My stomach literally hurts.
The cornhole was so funny
Bro Simon is tall af😭😭
4:50 is a brand new wii still that much??
8:33 - 9:40 Funny XD
10:06 I can’t stop laughing
Jj needs to wear that costume for the match
Ayo if anyone Watches Syndicate, he got the same chair Toby got!  Partition For Syndicate To be on some sidemen Videos (if it makes sense obviously)
What was the gaming device Simon got?
Pt 2 ? 🤷🏾‍♂️ this was all jokes
I didn’t know what to expect but that was actually a banger vid
The Sidemen always spred my cheecks😊
i did my cbt and u get a bike like its nothing hahaha. i cant even afford rn
Banger of a vid didnt expect this
Do the 100K VIDEOOOOOO
The electric bike jj got msg seem good… I had the exact model and it’s awful so much went wrong with it within 2 months I exchanged it 3 times for the same bike but obviously new and I ended up getting a complete refund
Simons hella annoying
Your store is opening on my birthday, surely that's worth a birthday surprise boys?
Need more of these best video in a while
Finally Simon has arrived in intro
DO A GIVEAWAY BOYZ
That IBM computer instantly reminded me if Steins Gate
W vid
I love mystery boxes lol
JJ just gave Simon some good content. Flying to one of those countries or going to Bulgaria to fix up the house and give it to someone
Btw they have producers to tell them which boxes to get. It's actually so sad that everything is scripted nowadays. But they script it so the boys know what to say before hand; like ohh look how well timed the comedy is.
5:10 couldn't let this one slide
What got me into Sideman was the $100,000 spending video. I like the one where they spend on each other, and J.J. did a Jeuse theme. So I've been waiting a long for another one, man. This one was great.
Wait.... 7 boxes each 10k value.... =100k?
12:26 when the editors are from India
Bro this sidemen Sunday was one of the best in a long time this was a really original video idea
It always is a monay sidemen video for indians 😢
Did ksi forget to put ads on the video again
Top tier video!
Old sidemen video vibes!! Studio vids have been missed
Love this video idea!! Want to see this more
sidemen need to be wholesome again
Joshes box was dope
31:50 behz lookin a lil saucy
Ethan saying “lashes” is mad 😂😂😂
SO WE AINT GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW JJs PEN MADE TOBI DAB
I wouldn’t be mad if someone payed for hustlers university
I'm glad they're starting to do different things again
Why so many beers ads? It’s like they know the young people watch this
sidemen no more natural aint gon lie
Top Job Chaps 🤘
Nah this sidemen Sunday was acc very entertaining
We need more of this!!! W... Can I have a box next time.. This would be a good one to do with fans, and I'll take one for the team and go first?
ethan , such a mood
I’ve accepted that math alludes the Sidemen. “We each get $10,000.00 to spend on whatever we want equaling $100,000.00.” 7 Sidemen x $10,000.00 = $100,000.00. Quick maths
omg I actually feel bad for Simon ... but such a great video idea, loved it!!
Enjoyed that 👌
Simon should actually go to Haïti, I think it's by far the best of the bunch. Assuming he leaves the resort it would be a humbling, but special experience.
GOD BLESS
WAIT THERES A BOWLING BALL. Wait why is there a bowling ball is hilarious
Favorite Sidemen video of the year so far.
I feel bad for vikk. Dude got nothing except a 10k worth of gold
Andrew tate gona like this
The bad box is opened at the last. That's sus on the Scripted Meter.
31:50 💀💀💀💀💀
behz with the golf club swing at minter edit was mad lmao
I love this vid
Bear cub Taxidermy
Do a youtube video fixing up the home in Bulgaria
Now that Simon is married, tali has suggested his legs be blurred and seen by her only.
So what did Simon end up getting from Toby’s box?
bro why was the musical chairs song so trash
We never saw what simon took from tobi's box
goated vid idea
nostalgic vibes
Take it to a million likes
Respect the first dude that didn’t tell the perfect box lol
Simon and Tobi forgot to swap an item
Ethan wont stop scratching his balls
Tbh I wish JJ would have actually balled out on his mystery box. Like NOONE wud have guessed it wouldnt be bad. Like first class tickets to santorini, a weekend first class resort.
This was such a good video but it won't get views sadly  😢
This video was so sick
Should have became a Lord for 4,000 lots priced at $25 each.
Paid to have fun😭😆
The indian is still strong in vik i see
2:20 I should of stolen..
Well what did Simon get out of Toby’s box?
I feel like this is a video that should get a part 2 eventually. Maybe with some guests
5:12 wtf is Ethan doing 😂
Tobi reading that word was an absolute master class
Yo what's the song or music at 21:51 at JJ's Turn?
Amazing video ❤
Harry fuming over ethans box is hilarious😂
musical chairs had me crying😂😂😂
Shouldve hadeach person know their pwn box so they don't pick it
I just love tobi so match, just the way he wanted to replace jj cus simon said he had pain was so wholesome
The first banger in a while.
Ethan and Harry are like the best in musical chairs, its mostly down to these 2 lad in the final
toby dabbed at 17:23
Vikk is a genius bro damn
Banger of a video. I would LOVE to watch another one of these! Sidemen should make another.
Imagine Harry used his steal on Vik's box and stole the £10k gold bar💀
I'm so happy for Josh
Who’s box is who’s now? Like who was the first?
One of the top videos over the years, would definitely like to see the same video but with callux, cal, theo, chip, randy, deji and chris!!!
Need another one of these!!! This was great
Simon: What is that?! Then Ethan do the Harry style 😂😂
Tobi squeezing in the bear pun 😂
I need to know the out tro song!!
Simon needs to make a video of him going to his home in Bulgaria
He look bear happy how did everyone missed that 😢
What an idea.
5:11 I like how Eithen is man handling his meat while talking to Simon W mans.
The first challenge gave me flashbacks of silent library when they had to pick cards
Genius concept
Ksi dressing up as blackmail got me 😂😂
There needs to be a counter of how many times ethan grabbed his c#ck this video 😂
Goated studio vod
I like when sidemen does these game show type videos.
32:00
Simon is back 🙂
37:23 37:59 38:12
Bike all the way!!  Vroom vroom
This is a banger for a very ling time
Vikk said kenya..and simon asked if it is in that continent💀😂😂
MAN LIKE WHAMMMSTAR123
173k likes in 7hrs ..... gotta hit that mill :D
Best sidemen sunday in like 3 months
is tobi missing teeth?
quality content. real quality content.
It wouldn’t surprise me if ksi didn’t even do his box. If his assistant did do it I want a vid, or Atleast a short of proof of ksi getting the yellow card. Y’all should have a card series when u have to yellow or red card someone, have it as a lil special segment on sideplus
Come to iran simon
just how itchy are ethans balls? someone count the amount of times hes touched em 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That beat tho at 34:10 tho 🔥🔥🔥
This was gas
16:28  MiniMisser
Bangerr
Ksimon will never be the same🥲
Viks box has me crying that is great stuff😂😂
We need Simon to do a video going to his new home in Bulgaria
Harry saying “arch it bro arch it arch it” 😂😂😂😂
31:43 Vik’s sheffield accent coming out 🤣
That ending song is so lit? Any credits?
How didn’t no one laugh at 8:12
Ay give josh props for mentioning 212 by azaelia banks lmao
I like the concept but we need an upgraded version with random mystery boxes
Peak Sidemen vid here! 😂
Tobis bear pun in so underrated
W video
Come to iran bro💎
Ethan got the itchiest nuts on the planet
BlueWaters not chavy  it's quality 😂
I was crying watching the bean bag game 😂😂😂😂😂
such an awesome video idea. hoping another one can be something like this
Idk why but I’ve always liked these “shopping spree” Sunday’s and this one was no exception
so the take here is that the worst box is vik’s and josh’s
Lol jj got karma and pushed tobi out of the way at the beginning
It's meant to be, Simon getting KSI's box
That telescope really isn’t that great Harry
Has nobody else noticed Con tapped KSI twice on the chest when he asked which is a good box. And the best box was the second one???!!! Subtle
Poor minter 😂
Really enjoyed this video
banger bro
Are we just ignoring the fact that Simon didn't pick anything from Tobi's box at the end?
Common guys we need a mil likes so they can do $100,000 each box
Iran is actually a very pretty country
Simon went from getting married to getting violated  Love to see it
tobi box pic  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
8:10😭😭
LOL Bluewaters is about to be shut down on Saturday 😂
This video is gold. Great concept, great moments. And the fact that it's under an hour is awesome as well. Incredible. Arguably the best of this year.
This video is amazing, love it.
I recently begun making YouTube videos. Does anyone have advice on how I can improve them?
Traveling to My new Bulgarian Home would be a banger video ngl 🤣🤣🤣
36:18
so vik basically just washed 10k back to himself in gold…. genius
If u didn’t like this so we can see 7 100k boxes I’m disappointed.
Ngl didn't like last week's video but this one's a banger!
😂
Part two with a higher budget is definitely a good shout 👌🏽
Ethan grabbing his nutts at 5:09. Edit. He is scratching his nutts most of the video.  🦀
I like to think Ethan came up with this video idea so he could make Tobi being in bare boxes jokes all day
Outro song please
Make the musical chairs a more sidemen game!
Absolute banger!
15:05 why did everyone air Tobz joke? It was on point 😂
It's a weird vid 😂 but approved
What song was that during musical chairs the JME song
sidemen store on my birthday and one of the funniest games of musical chairs every
Please for the love of god do another video like this it was amazing and funny the whole way through
We need a bts vid on them buying the stuff for the boxes if they did record the process surely
Yoo that was the most hilarious musical chairs I’ve ever seen! Harry and Ethan are elite 😂😂
45:12 wait Simon never took anything from Toby
Hate to be that guy but, should have*
Each side member being given 10000 but there is only 7 sidemen so that’s 70000
These lot have actually been lowkey closeted for like a decade it’s amazing 🤣
This was a good video
Ppl might see the title and think it’s a dead vid but just watch it, it’s a great vid
what did Simon take from tobi's box tho?
Anybody notice the matrix programming, they associated Andrew Tate with Cheap houses and bad airfares, this is a form of propaganda. Theses celbs sell their souls and have to talk bad against anybody exposing and talking truth.
Miniminter should honestly visit Iran and make a vlog, it actually a sick country not as bad as the other ones on the list
Play lil jr in sidemen charity cup
sidemen lets work on some maths LOL 100k mystery box each side men get 10k, 7 sidemen LOL
Nah that kart for señor frogs next year, bussin 🥵
37:23 Brotha, man’s taken a direct hit to the chest. And Harry took the other in the face. This whole video is comedy gold. I would want them to do another one, but with the YouTubers from the last brutally rates .
Your math don't add up from the start 😂😂, 7 sidemen $10000 each doesn't equal $100000
Good videe boys👍🏾
I now want to see Simon do a Vlog Series on turning his derelict bulgarian house into a comfy fixer-upper. Anyone else also wanna see that?
This was such a banger of a video, please do this again
This is the unique type of sidemen Sunday we came to know and love
Sidemen are so washed. Wtf are these videos
That rainbow road edit got me ngl hahahah
5:11 ethan scratching his balls
first video in a long time where I actually watched through it
That @DudePerfect cameo tho
what did simon take
We need this every month on a sidemen Sunday
hi
Bullets 😂
Please do this again! It was so freaking funny and entertaining
I'l have the HU if no ones using it
a wii aint 325 pounds lol
10/10 best video in ages
best sdmn vid this year
5:10 yo wtf is ethan up to
do this again but let the fans make the random boxes and put me in that video.
BANGER
Ethan itching too much bruv
Simon finally came from clapping Talia’s cheeks 😏
10k x 7= 70k …..the maths r not mathing
How the heeeellll is no one talking about the flipping SIGNED RONALDO BOOT OOOOHHHH MY DAAAAYS
I'm having trouble seeing the purpose behind opening those boxes. Will they actually be able to keep the items? If that's the case, I must say, this video was quite disappointing, especially considering the fact that they're already millionaires
This vid was sooo good
One of the best videos on the channel. Kept me on the edge of my seat 😂🙌
100k mystery box, each given 10k for each box, 7 boxes total, 7 boxes are worth 100k, something isn’t adding up 😢😂
Honestly top 10 sidemen Sunday of all time
Now we really want to see the 100k one of this. This is elite!
29:41 love the how I met your mother reference by Simon
Simon looked like he guessed 210 randomly, how in the hell did he do that?
Harry acting like he cant buy these 1000 times over lmao
Alright boys, start planning the 100k version
This was a banger
Should “have” stolen*
Can I have the ticket to AFGHANISTAN because I’m from Afghanistan and I live in the Netherlands and I want to go there but the tickets are so expensive!!!! Love your videos been a fan since the start of the sidemen ❤️💪🏽
Vik: spanker Simon: spankie Also Simon: “I got to get spanked by vik!” Josh: “that’s alright” 🤔
I am from Tanzania so happy they said mountain Kilimanjaro is from Tanzania and not Kenya
This was a belter sidemen Sunday! Top tier 👌🏽 Harry was the real winner though the telescope and 10k in cash look at his face 😂😂😂😂
Well what did Simon take from Toby?
I found the general knowledge round and the corn hole round to be the funniest part of the vid. 😂
I don’t understand ? What was the point of opening those boxes ? What where they going to do with those things? Do they get to keep them ? If so it’s dead fam, they’re literally millionaires
What is the background music when they open vik's box? it is mad!!! the beat is on fire!!
W video
Nah the Hustler's University papers in JJ's box had me 💀
This was so much fun make more of these
Best video in a long time
The fact Tobi got the box with the last supper after he said Jesus would want me to pick this one is flawless
More of these! Super entertaining boys 🎉
1.5m views in 5 hours, what a banger.
Amazing vid
28:42
I love how Josh and Vikk added a bit of spice to their boxes
surely do one where 4 boxes are $25,000 and 3 boxes are $250
Watching this from Afghanistan 🖐
We need an "Ethan scratching his balls" counter for this video
Hope they don’t actually fire the guy
gotta run this back
As a iranian i say just throw away your ticket😂
simon HAS to do a vid on the house
6:12 Simvik is sailing
So Ethan's original idea flopped so they tried to salvage what they could to gather more views 😂😂😂😂
5:34 It's such a coincidence that the christian guy got the last supper canvas
ETHAN GET UR BALLS CHECKED U CONSTANTLY TOUCH THEM IN EVERY VIDEO AND ITS ONLY U WHO DOES IT
2:36 Nah the editor is wrong for pitting that clip ☠️
jj hangs out with logan now. ofc he tried to scam.
glad south africa 🇿🇦 made it in the video🤣
I'm happy my guy Josh W'd up, that's my guy
But wait what did Simon steal?
Cant wait for simons vlog in afghanistan
The best one in quite sometime 😂😂😂
9:30
They need to do  this again it  was soo fun to watch
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 video
lol imagine simon actually joins the hustler's university and starts making BANK
The pictures bottom left for the boxes they picked are actually amazing 😂
LOVE THAT HARRY REALIZED ENVY WAS A SIN  JESUS CHRIST IS THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE  AMEN
Is it a coincidence everyone is wearing a white shoe
Simon forgot to pick 1 item from Tobi's box....
Sidemen editors need a pay rise…..Toby on rainbow road absolutely killed me 😂😂😂
I wish I got Simon's box 😢😢.
need to know what simon stole from tobi
What did Simon get from Tobi's box?
yo Vik, drop the whole "I don't care" act man it ain't it
Amazing video
What did Simon get from Tobi??????
Why did harry get a steal and no one else
As a South African bullet is accurate😅😂🇿🇦
ethan's box for josh was actually so cold
Also does Ethan need to see a GP about the scratching of his?
personal beef with ksi for that ,
Simon making him use his steal so that he wouldn’t use it on him was a power move 😂
Simon surely has to do a video travelling to the home and doing it up. Maybe a location for the bad team to stay on a bad vs good holiday 😂
I LOVE HARRY SO MUCH
KSI - making devious plans to pay off staff for insider tips Harry - NOT TODAY, SATAN
Been following these guys for a good while, started off not really liking Simon but now he’s my favourite one, funny lad
Good video
please do a vid for the all the sidemen crew/backroom staffs.
14:54 nah this edit 😂 This vid is the best one of the year
Yooo ethan stop grabbing your dic fam
“7 boxes worth $10,000, totalling a grand total of $100k for the title 🎉” 😂
South African pound 😭😭 bruv do people know that little about SA
Can yall ask Ethan to stop grabbing his junk every 2 seconds🤦🏽‍♀️🤣 Otherwise... loved the video😂😂
Can I have the ticket to Afghanistan please
I beg this vid get 1 mill likes to do it again probably my favourite sidemen sunday
Simon needs to renovate that house in Bulgaria with Talia for a YouTube video
I can't lie this was one of the most entertaining Sidemen video ever
New King vik ❤ 😅
the musical chairs had me pissing meself 🤣
22:35 I Couldn’t Stop Laughing At This Joke From Ethan LOL 😂😂
As usual another awesome video from the Sidemen🔥🔥🔥 we need part two of this
These are the best type of sidemen Sundays instead of like £10 vs £10000 holidays
I haven’t laughed this much at a video in a while, this was too funny 😂
One of the videos gotta be a fixer upper with that home
Sick video tbf
Harry snapped the chair, Ethan still grooming his balls every vid. Just standard really
The musical chairs had me in stitches🤣🤣🤣
Now do this with varying amounts of money and a level up
w we will see simon in bulgaria w ksi w sideman and w everything 🎉
That was one of the best sidemen Sunday i watched in  a while i didn't even notice the time
I need to see a bez vid of him on that dirt bike 😂
Best video in ages
This is definitely a banger. Probably one of my favorite sidemen videos this year.
"General Knowledge🙋🏼‍♂️"  I never thought id hear a How I Met Your Mother reference in a Sidemen video but here we are
Harry getting 10k is going to be a meme a 100% 😂😂
I was expecting JJ’s box to just be barrels filled with condoms.
100k mystery box on the way
This was one of my most favorite vids of the year! Way to go guys!!!
The best video I’ve seen for a long time, need a part 2!
Quality video
The editor writing "I should of stolen" at 12:26 is really icky
Vik is smart man gold man is ready for future
Josh sure knows a LOT about spanking, bro
At least Haiti is a nice Caribbean island
Damn how much they paying if they didn’t accept the 5K
Can I have the Andrew Tate thing
That musical chair was for some reason a funny bit.
Can we have a more sidemen musical chairs
I also hate playing musical chairs and having a great time with my colleagues Behz 💀
Simon has the best item being the old computer that is!
Underated moment 08:10
Ethan got a 50cc gilera lol
This video is going to be good I can already tell, with all of the seven sidemen too
Hustlers university acc is fire I woulda been hella lit
my fav sidemne video
Zerka got blessed. That Ronaldo boot 😳
Good to see Ethan and his Colleagues
The Korn hole had me in stiches! 🤣😂🤣
Ethan and Harry is the best duo 😂😂
This was actually a good sidemen Sunday
Please do a video with the new house in Bulgaria
I want to know what simon picked from tobis box
I loved this vid man. It felt like the old sidemen again with boys getting together to just have fun, whilst also making the most of their now business and production opportunities
harry looks so good in this video 😫
ethan’s - harry box josh - ethan’s box vik - viks box harry - josh box simon - jj box
A completely different video concept on the Sidemen channel?!?! What's happening 😅
Love this video❤
I don’t why the 4 tickets to Afghanistan killed me 😂
Loved this vid🙌🏆
Wait so what did Simon pick from Tobi!?
Welcome to HU Simon 😂
good vid
The sidemen are too rich for me to enjoy these days
Perhaps a video about Extraterrestrial Disclosure?
That house in Bulgaria is a video in itself
Squashies are phenomenal.
this is one of the funniest vids they have ever posted, love this kinda content, more studio shoots pls
I'll have the ticket to Haiti 🥹 🇭🇹. Im right over the pon so dont mind flying out of Heathrow either 😅. Beautiful country first black independent nation and led the slave revolution all throughout the caribbean and sound America abolishing slavery and many countries even helping Americans buy states like lousianna 💪🏾🔥 free fun facts 🇭🇹 my ancestors built different
the maths not mathing for 100k but who cares sdmn OP
at 29:34 someone messed up the points😘
What a banger💛💛
why harry anounce his steal like that 😂
Vikkstar thinking he’s being cool by not caring is pretty cringe
The balloon popping in slow motion is pretty cool looking.
Ethan hitting himself in face with the go kart, then him and harry fighting like brothers over musical chairs! Brilliant 👌🏼
14:52 that edit was mental 😂
“it’s a venus flytrap ya donut”  ~ bog
Harry was proper heart broken 😂
This was a banger. Best video in a while.
Simon has a main channel video doing up the new crib
Big up jj the boxing lad
Ethan keep touching his balls  bro..
SO? secret santaz with a twist?
Make a video of them doing up the house in bulgaria
Who’s idea was it to have the only in person sidemen shop in Kent lmao
Genuinely a good video after a while ly sidemen
Who's box did Tobi and JJ open? They didn't say in the video
This Video was so Fun😭
There should be a more sidemen video on the guys buying/putting together  their $10,000 box
Simon for his main channel should actually go on all the flights, banger vid
Harry’s excitement for money is truly beautiful ❤😢
Ethan in the iconic hide and seek t shirt ✨
It actually would've been funny af if someone else got vikk's box. Missed opportunity...
8:10 😂 poor Ethan
Best sidemen Sunday this year! 🙌🏻
Josh W
wait so did simon take anything from toby’s box then?
10000x 7 is not 100 000 $
JJ wants a good box and then buys crap stuff for someone else lmao
a bunch of 30 yr olds btw
A wii is not £325 that’s just milking crap for cash
SIMON PLEASE GO TO AFGHANISTAN IT WILL BE A VERY GOOD VIDEO
This video actually slapped
simon didint  pick any item from toby
This video was so sick
ethan complaining over kSI "scamming a box" yet he was the one cheating during the musical chairs
People who didn't come from tiktok are allowed to like this
Beta squad killing it.
Sidemen never fails to entertain
First time acc laughed out loud in a while at sidemen when musical chairs
Ronaldo the best suiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
5:11 didn’t need to see that Ethan
Such a w vid better than a hide and seek every other week
Pls do a giveaway
To think Harry has been to SA and doesn’t know the currency 🤦🏽‍♂️😂.
I NEEEED that boot
nice
A good sdmn video after quite some time
This was so funny loved it
Im going to iran in September could I have that ticket by any chance at all 😂
Simon should do a video of visiting house in Bulgaria 😂
Simon carried
7 * 10,000 apparently equals 100,000?
Another banger of a video
19:45
Ethan looks happy with his colleagues❤
Not a cactus m8
Finally a good video
So Harry just straight up took something from Tobi and that didn't count as a steal?
By all means, KSI needs to be the sidemen's assistant for 2 days just for making Simon go through hell. Simon didn't deserve the bad box
i love how jj has given top g money lol
whats the song used at 15:55 - 16:05 ?
We definitely need a part 2, this was banger content
“The Royal Mail’s Delayed” I lost my mind so funny
Hey Sidemen Group I saw the bowling ball in one of the boxes and I am willing to pay yall in some way shape or form for it!! I am a professional bowler and I have been looking for that specific ball for a while! Please get back to me on this!!
What did Simon steal?
Who's hype for the charity match
deffo need a 100k on each box for part 2
Does literally no one know that it's  "should've stolen," not "should of"? I think I used to do that but I see that everywhere and I'm quite concerned with the wellbeing of the princess in this dreadful he- I mean I'm quite concerned.
Give me this ticket to iran
5:11
Its so funny for simon to have jjs 😂
Behz keeps touching his peepee cuz of simons spanking
This vid was a banger. The vibe is still there
One of the best sidemen Sundays in a long time as a good original idea not hide n seek or holiday
This video is a banger pls give us more but bigger budgets
This was the best video in a bit great work guys!
31:48 Ethan just emoting out of the blue like some Roblox donny 😭
What did Simon get from tobi’s box?
My favourite sidemen video in a long time!!
Again 9:50 Com
Man, Ethan's box was incredible. That Hamilton wheel, god damn.
miniminter had a lotta jiggle back there. home gym paid off!
The music chairs shenanigans is why Ethan and Harry are the best duo.
31:48 so were just not gonna talk about this 😂
Ethan and Harry played musical chairs the right way 😭😭
yo CON GLEW UP NAH WAIT CON?
The tickets are wild 😂
Seeing Josh happy is so wholesome! He seemed so excited!
Harry became a different person with them glasses on
please do this again
Realistically they are giving everyone there stuff and selling the useful stuff back
We need better hosting/commentary and outro
This was so goooooood😭
Yoooo Kon is looking WAAAAAM
they didn't show what simon took from tobi. he said what he might do, but no giant reveal. shame.
Vik just got married!!!!!!
I WOULD LOVE THAT BOWLING BALL😭😭😭I REALLY NEED A NEW ONE COME ON KSI BLESS ME
I was surprised there wasn’t an Alphorn in JJ’s box
One of the best sidemen videos
fr so happy about this video!! gonna be honest felt like some of the content lately has been slacking (but i understand everyone’s idea of good content is different so i appreciate it anyway) and this video has really upped the game. for the first time in a while they are all properly in the video together with no guest appearance and all the vibes are good! keep it up boys
jj should use that cycle in a music video
Whose idea was this ?
This vids editing was top tier
Watching this makes me want to see a Sidemen Storage Wars Video
Loved this! Reminded me of like old storage hunters😂😂
25:39 Vik's face😂
Come to Florida
jj is actualy a bad person
Every single box they like oh no that’s Harry’s box
Kai sent it
Simon has moved from Black to Brown.  Still involves chicken and rice, possibly?  I hate both of those things unless the chicken is in nugget, strip, or popcorn form.
JJ's box wasnt even that bad, ill 100% take the rest of the crap plus an iPhone 14 and a ROG handheld
People say Ethan has bad luck when it's always Simon who gets the stinkers lol
20:15 damn Ksi has gray hair😢time flies
What did Simon take from Tobi's box tho?
Best sidemen Sunday in a long time!
Tobi is such a beg
I'm surprised Tobi didn't find that painting offensive.
The musical chairs was too jks the competitiveness🤣
Omg this was a brilliant concept. Exciting and hilarious to watch😂
🔥
New trend?
JJ's box was jokes. 😂😂😂
As a Tanzanian, my dissappointmemt is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
what the snowflakes try cancel simon for answering "bullet".
Wiis are still worth that much?
7x10,000£= 70,000£ not 100,000£
One way ticket to Afghanistan 😂😂😂
why is it the wii console the thing that confused me the most in this :D
Love the last 2 simon v harry pure class ❤
We need another sidemen cornhole video. It’s so funny
A nice enjoyable video
We wanna see Simon cleaning that house and put some furniture in it
Blud got the Derbi senda 😁
Ksi ruins everything in these types of videos.
Why does Ethan keep grabbing his lil soldier.? Wtf lol
Talia's gonna have to train her spankin' arm. 😂😂😂
VIK try not to be boring challenge
Omg I’ve never laughed so hard with the musical chairs
enjoyed that nice vid!
How much ya wanna bet that the Sidemen are gunna use that Bulgrian house in the next vacation video?
Simik is blossoming
Grass is a common name for the plants that belong to the family Poaceae, also known as Gramineae. These plants are characterized by their long, narrow leaves that grow from the base of the plant, as well as by their stems, which are usually hollow and jointed. Grasses are found in a variety of habitats, including lawns, prairies, savannas, and meadows, and they are often used as a food source for grazing animals such as cows and horses. In addition to their ecological and agricultural importance, grasses are also used for a variety of other purposes, such as for making paper, thatching roofs, weaving baskets, and as ornamental plants in gardens. here are some additional facts about grass: -   Grasses are one of the most widespread and diverse plant families, with around 10,000 species found around the world. -   Grasses are typically herbaceous plants, meaning they do not have woody stems, although some species, such as bamboo, can grow quite tall and have woody stems.   -   Grasses are often adapted to survive in environments with frequent disturbances, such as grazing or fire. They have developed various strategies to cope with these disturbances, such as being able to regrow quickly from their roots or producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil until conditions are favorable for germination. -   Grasses play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, as they are able to capture and store large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in their leaves and roots. -   Grasses are also important for soil conservation, as their extensive root systems help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. -   Many grass species have a symbiotic relationship with fungi, which live in their roots and help them to absorb nutrients from the soil. -   Grasses are used for a variety of human purposes, including as food for livestock and humans (e.g. wheat, rice, maize), for biofuel production, and for landscaping and ornamental purposes. -   Grasses are wind-pollinated, and their flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with simple structures adapted to efficient wind dispersal of pollen
Harry cashed in like Seth Rollins
Part 2 please!!!!!!!
Who tf guys someone a one way ticket to Afghanistan 😂

i hate josh
The Bulgeria house could make for a good sidemen Holiday. Or a renovation video with a twist
23:10 why was that oh bog so wholesome
The taxidermy bear is just pure animal abuse. Hunting a highly intelligent animal just to stuff it and sell it for thousands... And all for a prop in a video. Awful
Y’all did Simon dirty with that golf swing edit cuz now people can take that edit & use it for a ton of crazy memes☠️
Finally new ISH content from these love most the stuff they got going but some are getting stale so nice to see

If ive learned anything from this its that Ethan really enjoys musical chairs.
Watched this the night I’m back from F1 Silverstone, as a Hamilton fan, I’m jealous as fuqqqq 😍 enjoy that table josh, I’d love something like that 🍻🙌🏻
JJ acted shocked that the box he picked was good but the crew literally told him the box wasn’t his.
Hahah omg! Ethan with the musical chairs , hahaha that’s passion !!!! He deserved to win loli 😂😂😂 I have never laughed so much watching a Sidemen Sunday! 😂😂😂
JJ launching the beanbag at Simon at the speed of sound had me dying😂
Bro ong one of the best videos of the year

Ayo why Ethan keep groping himself like that
Best sidemen video in a min
Simon Bulgarian house tour when?
My friend bought a cheap house in Bulgaria online when she was drunk. She went there and did it up and lives there now, loves it!
From the broken chair to the cornhole brutality to the overall wholesome/laid back vibe, really hit the mark with this one lads 👏
Videos I need to see come out of this: Simon going to his new luxury estate in Bulgaria Ethan learning to ride his motorbike on his 4 acres
Best upload they’ve had in a while 😂 every second was gold
Hey iam watching from iran
I love that it just them and no guests. peak

Sidemen should do a 1 % club
@24:41 ethan and tobi are epic 😂😂🔥👌
What did Simon steal of Tobi ?

That old computer monitor is worth Ps, not matching IBM PC but do pass that on to a retro computer collector

Nah props to Simon for the video🙌 It was unique and a captivating new concept. It had anticipation throughout
think this is the first time simon got shafted in awhile
Harry is the goat 🔥
we didnt see what simon took from tobi
Harry is my favourite member of the Sidemen, don’t know why he just gives off good vibes
is it just me or does harry look kinda slim?
From a long time fam - this video is insane everybody in sync , editing on point and the banter is impeccable  Feels good to see this kind of content ngl love it
Man said the South African pound 😅😂😂😂😂
732,932nd
Salute General Knowledge 🫡🫡🫡
Rich people getting expensive stuff... cool concept
Ethan i beg send me the bike ❤❤🎉😂😂
Anti climax
We’re all glad Harry got the money, felt bad for the fella when his box got tooken.
that derelict house has the potential of a great video in the future
212 AZEALIA BANKSSS YEAH JOSH

Ethan vs harry musical chairs had a me dying 😂😂
39:57
Simon has to go to his new home!!
Wow how much weight kon has lost big up him
Can we get a sidemenreacts “tobi allegations” edition
5:11 “what is that” as Ethan is scratching the shmeat
stinker
39:08 sounds like an Aitch ad lib
gives me old sidemen vibes I like
Banger
I could take the Afghanistan ticket😂
the bean bag game was brillant!!
Need to know where they got the electric bike from jjs chosen box
There's still something wholesome about how they act like they're not all millionaires in videos like this 😂😂
What did simon take from tobi
If they new the value of the boxes they had to win but not the contents the comps would made sense
this video was sick! really enjoyed it boiiissssssss
“It’s a Venus fly trap “ 😂😂
41:16 meanwhile us poor common folk suffering through cost of living...
Editing in this video was amazing…🔥🔥👌🏽
Finally worth content i expect from this guys.
Bullets for south african currency,nee Simon,daais net verkeerd😹
9:24 😂
Vik's box should of gone to somebody else man was gonna be joks 😂🤣🤣
simon should visit those countries and do a vlog there
My only question is what did Simon pick from Tobi's box?
Great video, so funny!
Zerkaa got an unreal box there.
8:31 😂
Ksi in nikes ??
Is this the new sidemen warehouse??
Simons bullets joke….
cant wait for simon's "I survived 24 hours in my home in bulgaria" vid
Good vid
5:07 😂😂
Deffooooo needs to become a new series !!
Sidemen drunk corn hole👀
Harry looking ten years younger
this sidemen video was sooooo good👍
musical chairs was gold
We didn’t get to see what Simon got from Tobi’s box
Imagine Harry stole from Viks box
This was really sick!  Seeing all the tension with each box pick was intense.
44:03 big fan from Iran
This video was vibes
when simon said "which one they have choosen" at the start lmao
20:06 😂😂😂
Sidemen had become repetitive, this was a good change, I enjoyed the video
This has to be the new thing, I want to see this with other people. Imagine Gib, Deji, Baker, Chip, Lux and Freezy in these kind of videos
£100,000 grand please!!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
They going to cancel the video cuz of this bear 🤣😭
Great video concept
The question is: how many times Ethan touched his wood in this video..?
Omfg the musical chairs ending was so good bro
Where are they getting $100,000 from? 70,000 pounds is not $100k
absolute banger of a video
I Would gladley take the trips from KSI!! 😂😂 See the world and some sand, camels and great food, why not.
Jj’s face at 24:09
this is probs one of the best vids yk
Countries like those are a one way ticket to visit .
JJ booking one way flight tickets to Afghanistan,Iran & Russia was hilarious 💀
Definitely need another one of these 😂
LOVE YALL. Vids are amazing makes my day
One way ticket 🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀
This is why I look forward to Sundays
Wait so which box was Simon and Tobi
31:18 nah simon is right (coming from a South African)
They got vik's name in the outro
Man’s always touching his crotch he needs to be tested down there
JJ trying to get Simon killed with those tickets 🤣🤣
So whoose box did Tobie get?
That house in Elhovo(Bulgaria) is nice. Come and visit it!!!
Nah the ending, the tickets part, they messed up for that, clearly know what they doing.
Let me have that bike lol
Best Sidemen sunday of 2023!
Just watched the vid and i’m already wanting part 2
Really good video
bruh this video was mad funny

Who’s box is who’s????
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not the sidemen store opening on my birthday 😊
Finally a legit video.....these are better than sidemen holidays
No one mentioning how much weight kon has lost fair play good in him
I died laughing when Simon said 4 tickets to Afghanistan cuz I could have used that
Round 2
Xix
Bro Simon NEEDS to go visit his house in Bulgaria!
get that million likes up we need it
Mid video as usual we aren’t mr beast fans stop it😭😭
Attention!! Get them 1 million likes and they will do it with 100k each box.
5:11 what is Ethan doing with his hand lmao
Simon new seeies house flipper irl
Ksi box was mad 😂
I am from afghanistan so the ticket part is quite funny...
Great video I was crying 😂😂😂

This video is so freaking good!!!
More sidemen videos with just  the boys, no guests pleaseeeee
Please make another one of these
Musical chairs was to funny my god 😅😅😂😂
general knowledge has to be a new ksi character mann
Josh going it’s quite useful 😂
1 way tickets to paradise 😂😂
There should be a part two but with like the troops 👀
As a South African I took that personally
this was a quality idea lads, the one way ticket to afgan got me creasing
Simon needs to make a video of him going to places he got the tickets for and visiting his house🤣🤣
I be so gassed with that ronaldo boot
this is a banger i wanna watch it again n again
a good idea for a video would be sidemen storage wars have the same setup in a warehouse with boxes and everyone gets a certain amount of money to bid
The musical chairs have killed me😂i love this
funniest sidemen sunday for sure
41:27 awh harry was so happy bless😂😂
this video was hilarious and 100%  one of their best
Simon use the Iran ticket please 😢at least let me see one sidemen 😅
i genuinely feel bad for simon tbf 😭✋
Welcome to Bulgaria broski 😆😆😆😆
Wow the corn bag game has wrote me off
Pls get 1m likes😂
one of the best videos ever
What they can do for next one is make each box a different price. So one can be 10$k, 20k and go higher to 100k to a mil. Be good vid and funny to see who gets what
Vikk & Josh had great ideas for their box! Loved their creative thinking! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Banger video  fairs
First
So whos got whos box?
Simon got videos out of his box, he can do a going to my new home main channel video
Sidemen Bulgaria hide and seak let KSI seak and everyone just go back to the u.k simons revenge
I am from Bulgaria 🇧🇬😂
South African bullets Bread cost one bullet at any store
Still waiting to find out what Simon took from Tobi’s box but seeming how it was the box he made up I think he seemed most excited by the massage chair so is that what he took?
Great video
Class video what a good idea
What a content when it twisted to be jj’s box the last one that had to be opened by simon😂
Simon better do a video where he goes to check out his home in Bulgaria 😂😂
big lucky block
Lil edit mistake on the general knowledge before they started Simon had 1 point
This was such a good video would love a 2nd vid of this challenge
Straight up if Simon were to do something with the house it’d make an amazing video
Im giessing "the $89k mystery box challenge" didnt have the same ring to it lol
WHO IS GOING TO THE SHOP WHEN IT COMES OUT  AT THE 15TH 👇
Vik gave himself a 10k investment on company dime ... chess, not checkers
41:34 tobi helped harry to record with his camera but then got slayed by harry didn’t give him some cash
Simon is actually too clever
really enjoyed this one. great job lads <3
Simon cant escape from JJ 😂
pure banger of a video! thats all
Tobi is the goat 🤫
33:34  Harry moment. "I think I might be autisitc"
This was a great vid icl!!
Ay simon, i can take that hustlers university if u aint gonna use it bro
Next sidemen Sunday, they do up the house in Bulgaria and give it to some randoms
Sidemen vids are so much better when they are all together at the same place
W Concept
Banger video
33:34  Harry moment. "I think I might be autisitc"
We need more videos like these
This video is such a banger concept!
They should do it with fans 😂😂 Everyone should put a box up for fans and should do this
Ethan has smashed it. Josh got the best box of the lot
so... what did simon pick from tobi's box?😭
This has been one of the most funnyest sidemen vids for a long time
As a South African, I approve Simon’s joke.😂😂😂
10:41 can someone translate what josh said
I love this video😂
I’ll take one of those tickets lad
this was actually funny. the entire video is just hilarious and the challenges were funny too. WWW
The photos on the mystery boxes at the start ☠️
So did simon not take anything?
Can I have the HU membership… please? 😂
All 7 sidemen only in a video feels weird no collage just them pure class
🐻
next time please do the show again with 100k per box
A christmas version of this with that 100k each box could be good. Could also do a naughty or nice variant
Harry needs to just do one already most unfunny human alive atm
I’m just waiting for the Vegans to try cancel the sidemen over the best 😮
Brother they keep going crazier and crazier especially Harry 😅😅😅
Before I watch this, I already love this idea cause idk what to expect. Sidemen videos been kinda repetitive lately.   Sidemen go skydiving next pls?🥺😅
General knowledge 😂🤣 29:35 I’m gonna do my best to get big on YouTube and make my dream of becoming friends with the sidemen a reality ❤
jj wrong asf for that lol
10:05 new sidemen moment of the year
11:50 finallyy an actual store yu can walk into plz have locations in America soon
What did Simon get from Tobis box?
Harry and Ethan during the musical chair killed me 😂
What a banger 🔥
KSIMON no it's now VIKKIMINTER
Man i thought the safes that vik got was actually kinda sick ngl
Ethan shows ticket to Afghanistan: Josh is it actually like a ticket? KSI its one way as well😂😂😂
slaps
they got 120 staff members filming and he needs a gopro to see what's inside
Honestly what a good video!
Why did ksi join the sidemen? I didn’t know they let any old celebrity in the group?
Best video of the year
JJ trying to scam them is mad funny
Best video in months
this was fun, love it
Best video in a while ❤
Love from Iran, also SImon we'd love to see u here! Well, I'd love to anyway lol!
Next sidemen store needs to be in Metrocentre Gateshead
Sidemen storage wars would be a all time classic ngl would be so good
what a video man, was refreshing to see a new concept of video
Looking forward to Simon’s upcoming “Bulgarian House Tour” video
Someone put "Boys, I'm a Bulgarian homeowner!" on a t-shirt 😂😂😂
The tickets to war ridden countries had me dying
What kinda mr beast vid is this
seeing 50cc motorbike in a sidemen video feels weird lmao. It's so big thing in Finland for 15 yos never thought I would see one in sidemen video
What’s the point of them all turning around after picking?
12:25 should've*
It's always the special ones that win musical chairs😂
the two people who actually got what they really wanted is vik and harry
W South Africa feature train

Simon violating South Africa by saying our currency is bullets 😂😂😂

19:55 ethan telling the black guy he deserves lashes 😂😂
noooo we didnt get to see what simon chose from tobis box😢
Damn Harry... lookin sharp.
Am I the only one noticing Toby literally dabbed 17:20
Ethan seems to be enjoying himself at his 9 to 5 with his work colleagues 😊
i love how harry kept grabbing the chair
I Like these Sidemen Video But a Tip would be is that they should explain what is happening more clearly than more quickly because it gets more confusing down the video.
Banger!
The violation towards SA 😮‍💨🇿🇦
Everyone cheering on JJ on the bike. Zerkaa: He’s a Big boy! 😂😂☺️
Well i’m from afghanistan but our country is not what ya’ll think like yes its war there but its not like what yall think saying and laughing that’s bad I’m sorry but that’s my country the media don’t show the beauty of that country and they don’t show how kind people of afghanistan are and how good people they are y’all can’t joke at our country because of war.
😂
the box with the bike and telescope was the best
32:12 yes I literally guessed 2009 ,I didn't even knew I just guessed
Why do they have to turn around
Joshua Zerkaa, i would like to steal some of those squashies mate
this was 100% my fav sidemen Sunday EVER!!
A one way trip to Afghanistan hahahahahahah

Great video
9:31 😂😂😂love it
Best Sidemen Sunday in a while  ❤❤
Harry and behz musical chairs had me crying 😂😂
Never would’ve thought id see the day where KSI was riding a penny farthing in a post box outfit.
How come they need to turn round?
100,000 or even 50,000 would be a great idea
Isn’t Simon supposed to get something from Tobi’s box. Deal is a deal.
Jj winning a football challenge for the first time since 19 0 blonk
the mario kart segment went crazy
That picture of Tobi is outrageous lmao
Sidemen should do a Storage wars
Simon got South Africa confused there with another one.
22:58 In Denmark that thing is called an vælte-Peter, which is translated to tumble Peter😂
8:08 killed me man 😭
The Iran ticket is a WIN
First Kilkenny won and now a sdmn Sunday, what a great day
❤
Bro I was watching on the dinner table with my headphones and watching Ethan get smacked in the face made me burst out laughing. My dad actually got scared😅
josh being so excited for the squashies is quite sweet lol
Simon needs to make a video going to his bulgarian house
17:02 harry: “I think he just might” Vik : who cares honestly * kicks the ball and doesn’t score * Oh! Why did it curve that way 👈🏽and not that way 👉🏽ffs 😤  He totally cared lol 😂
31:48 Can we appreciate how Tobi read Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia perfectly. Also the irony of the phobia of long words being 36 characters long is crazy. I feel bad for anyone that has this phobia having to explain it to someone lmao
i love this video i want more sidemen videos like that
It was hilarious! when Ethan and Harry broke the chair during musical chairs 😂😂😂
LOVED THIS VIDEO
when harry smashed the chair I died laughing
banger video need a part 2
No offence but these sidemen Sundays have been getting worse imo
As a bulgarian citizen I'm thrilled to welcome simon into his new home.
JJ was so zesty
This was a gold video boys! Loved it... defo needed more musical chairs lol
w vid
Why is simons energy so different and funny I’ve only watched 4 minutes so idk if it continues like that
why did they have to turn around after they picked their box?
8:09 ethan hitting himself was hilarious
ksi’s costume is called blackmail
Bulgarians here 🇧🇬 ?
Wait, did I miss Simon's steal on Tobi?
Simon getting JJ's box damn their chemistry❤😂  Talia might have him but JJs all over his mind..hahah😂😂
banger video, 'your going to afganistan' is too funny lmao
Josh actually sweats in every game including musical chairs 😂
who else watched the waterballoon pop in 0.25 speed over and over again
Musical chairs killed me
this was such a great video idea big W to who evers idea this was
Goated video
5:10 AYO ETHAN JJs gonna be jealous when he sees u doing that with simon whispering in your ear and touching u😂😂😂
Best game of musical chairs ever
We love to see the Mother City getting involved 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦South Africa!!! P.s please bring SIDES to South Africa!!!
only Ethan could call a Venus fly trap a cactus 🤣🤣
Anyone else impressed tobi could pronounce that word?
But what did Simon and tobi swap😭
20 seconds in and I can tell this video is a banger
Give this video a million like we want part 2.
Harry did not stole the box that ethan picked is hilarious, all the items in there is like all the wishlist item harry ever wanted😂
Someone forgot to censor 6:31 xd
19:14 hahahah
banger video
wait who made Tobi's box?
what did simon take from jizzles box
We absolutely need a HOUSE TOUR of Simon's new home!!!!!!!
The musical chair was one of the sideman calssics
Genuinely a decent sidemen sunday boys for the first time in a little while😅
This has to be one of if not the best sidemen video i have ever seen
feel like the video would of been better if they would of gave stuff away to fans
Crew getting too comfortable
As gent from South Africa🇿🇦, bullet is a crazy guess given our history 🤣☠️
the cornhole game was THE BEST PART.  WHEN'S THE ANNUAL MORESIDEMEN CORN HOLE CHALLENGE VIDEO COMING????
8:10
Banger
The editing in this video was very bad. It was all very rushed, too many sudden quick jumps. We couldn't even see what was in the boxes all that well.
Currency in South Africa  Bullets
monkey
josh got done so well, i want that lewis wheel
One of there best videos in a while
If there is one Sidemen who didn't  deserve the crap box it was Simon as he works the hardest out of all of ye for content and didnt take money and run. Simon deserved one of the better boxes. Harry and Vikk deserved the crap boxes cause they do no content on their channels at all. Harry is the laziest Sidemen of all.
GET THIS TO A MILLION LIKES GUYS
One of the best ideas ever
bhundo video banaviyo
♥️👍
Hi
5:12 trusttt
This was a good tax write off vid. At least it was more entertaining than just going shopping.
vik mentioned the probability thing bare times its not even true I expect better from him
27:10
We need to get this 1 million likes
Those tickets KSI got for Simon looks real. Kam Air which is an AFG airline.
love this vid idea 💡
I can’t with Ethan scratching his private region the entirety of this video.
I mean hey I’m from Afghanistan can have that 😅 AFGHANISTAN TICKET PLEASE 😅
Banger
Ethan scratching his crotch through the entire video 😂
Hi
What item did Simon pick from Toby’s box?
Honestly, even if Viks cage was only toilet paper, it would be very useful, especially in case of another lockdown 😂
Harry is always comedy gold!
What did Simon get from Tobi
😂😂 ayy Top G gets Sidemen money 😂 that assistant is jokes
What a banger of a video. The fire editing, musical chairs chaos, insane boxes, and it felt so poetic for the video to end with JJs box and of course Simon gets it. Hahahaha , legendary.
vik is such a nerd hahah
We NEED a sidemen and dude perfect collab
Personally my favourite vid of the year so far!
Good video idea but feels disorganised
Icl Simon deserved the worst box
Apart form the spanking, great vid!
5:31 that picture is sick
As a South African.. Simons response to the question "what is the currency of South Africa" him saying bullets was the most sad and true thing ever...
Classic Harry moves 😂
no one actually looked closely at the ronaldo signed boot its from his prime
Simon needs to do a video on visiting the House and renovating it!
What’s the song they played during musical chairs it’s hard
In this situation, vic is like a 5head genius to accidently choose his own box and walk away with 10k worth of gold.
The ticket to Afghanistan killed me 😂
ngl this is  one of my favorite videos
21:00 Harry’s Sisters POV.         Obviously Harry’s there too.
I died at the plane tickets
36:00 tobi stealing the toilet paper like it’s some treasure 😭😭
Bro got 1 way ticket to russha
The mini games were better than the actual mystery boxes
Simon saying currency in South Africa being bullets is jokes.
Is it just me who doesn’t get the concept of this video?
Real life house flipper coming soon from Simon
Wait so what did Simon choose out of Tobi’s box?
First sidemen video I've watched in a little while going to binge watch the rest of them that I've missed
NEXT VIDEO IDEA: THE SIDEMEN GO TO BULGARIA AND HOUSE FLIP IT
Is it just me or is vikk blue-ish?
That was the best sidemen video ever please make more
That massage chair looks similar to a fellow Syndicate's.
What did Simon take from Tobi´s box tho??
Amazing Video
this was such a good video wth
This is elit vid
Simon needs to visit his home in Bulgaria for a vid
Do the sidemen reply ❤
Ngl if everyone wins a box, no matter what, they all get 100 grand worth of something
Loved this video 😂
Thoroughly enjoyed 😂
Brilliant concept!! Need $100,000 per box next!
We gonna talk about Ethan at 5:10?
jjs box was too good
Jj wearing black socks in criminal
great vid would love to see more of this type
Nice dab from tobi at 17:23
Didn't even watch the video yet just wanted to be first 🥲
😅
THIS. BANGED
Could Simon do a video on renovating his Bulgarian home?   Might be too much effort and too expensive.  But I’d be interested to see what he could do with it
Ethan should go show his D, if its that itchy
Best sidemen video of 2023
Crazy Video, one of the funniest Youtube videos in a long time!!!
This was too funny. The musical chairs. Josh getting excited over the squashies. The one way tickets 🤣
But we didn't see what Simon tool from Tobi box
MoreSidemen play corn hole?
Big props to the editors 🙌  The edits at 14:56 🏌️‍♂️ 29:40 are totally sick 🙌🙌🙌
a
9:20  josh getting finessed by harry
Forgot the steal lmao
I don't know why they're saying "Oh no" like 10 bags isn't that much to a lot, if not, all of them. I'm sure Harry can pretty easily just buy all of the things in his box that he wants.
Best one ive watched yet
Happy for Ethan man😂
What wii did they buy that it was 325$
Their best vid in a while 👏
Okay but we have to see 100k version
They get sad cuz they didn’t win the good boxes but they know they could buy all of those things
South Africa ❤️ 🇿🇦
i hope ethans balls are done itching by now
W
7:55 the Tobi rainbow road edit was cute 🌈🏎🌈
pls give me the hustlers university guys
Imagine harry still had his steal in vicks and chose the 10000 gold and Vick went home with toilet paper
Josh really called the last supper as final supper @5:30 😂😂
Damn Ethan having so much fun with his colleagues
This video gave the perfect combo of old sidemen vibes. With the recent sidemen production level
20:22 I just had a great idea, Sidemen should have a "Money in the Bank" briefcase.  And it'll be a half day event where they compete some silly some tough tasks for it.  The person with the MITB briefcase could use it to Swap himself from team A to team B (on those $100 vs $100,000 trips).    People like Harry/Ethan/JJ could definitely hype and sell that gimmick and it'll be a hella great merch to sell regardless if it's a success or failure.   The meme potential would be like that overpriced basketball.  Bad publicity is still attention generating!   2023 - Sidemen Money In The Bank Video!!!!
W
Why is Ethan constantly itching his crotch. Please stop doing that.
Missing JME 😢
Vikk held on to that chest for dear life for the rest of the video 🤣
Ethan itching his willy when the lube was being shown was weird 😂😂😂😂😂
banger
Since when was vik funny
ethan and harry's musical chair finale was fantastic
No way Ethan won the chairs, Harry sat down
Of course JJ can't contain himself one he sees Simon on his knees 😂
Bucket squad vibes any1 else just like
vikkstar really went all in
The golf club edit was cleannn
Those 1 way tickets 😭😭😭😭🤣
Nice
Sidemen rule
Never seen someone throw overhand in corn hole lol
Hello
Only real OG’s will remember what the original thumbnail looked like 😎
Sooo good! Bring us more of this content!
Simon was elite in this video.
These are my fav but I’m miffed we didn’t get to see what Simon picked from TOBIS box!
The acting is soooo shait….. scripted AF😂😂😂
Need the $100K version of this asap
Did he say that bike is a 50cc??? As in what I rode when I was 5 years old 😅
I like how simon got a hustler university lmao
This is such a sick video, one of the best this year so different and such a cool idea 🔥
Can we talk about how epic the water balloon popping looked in slow motion?
5:11 Yo Ethan’s movin mad with that “wheres my hug” stance
3:54 Ethans joke at the beginning is so underrated 😭
Vik is the real winner here, cause he got the GOLD.
KSIMON LIVES ON
The best video for this year 🔥
if they dont do a video of living in Simons new house for a week i am going to be annoyed
As if Tobi did it first time 😂
No way one of the sidemen’s owns a house in my country man big up Simon🇧🇬
2:09 josh 🤣🤣
I think josh should give me the ronaldo boots
good video lmao
Am I the only one who can see that harry lost weight
Legit, best sidemen video this year 👌🏼
such a good video
3:07 😭😭😭
yet another banger
before watching the video i think harry is geting screwed over and jj is going to screw someone over and ethan is going to forget XD
Ok so… Tobi- tobi Ethan- Harry Ksi-Simon Josh- Ethan  Vik- vik Harry- josh  Simon- Ksi
Ethan is actually so bloody jarring
My dream is to get a bike but unfortunately my family can’t afford one so I’m stuck Whatching videos liek this and experiencing the joy with them
37:32 😂
another banger
Finally a sick video
These thumbnails NEED TO STOP
JJ killed me with his box
Lmao as a person who lives in Bulgaria this house is just abounded waiting for someone like JJ to buy it for that much money
We NEED 100,000 grand boxes!!!
JJ's box is actually comedy
Fun video
Vik's "who cares" attitude in every Sidemen video lately is dead
Thank god this is fire y’all were in need of a banger
36:48 KSI admitted Josh has then 😂
harrys box is really picked by him lol
This was such a funny video. I fully enjoyed every bit of it. Please do another one with guests choosing their boxes and the 100k like Simon said!
Damn kon lookin good
As someone from Bulgaria simon's box was fire
Best sidemen sunday this month
The best sidemen Sunday of this year by far!
I want this to get to 1 million likes straight away
The only time JJ genuinely tried to be nice in one of these videos he got crushed at the end by Ethan. BTS showed there was actually a couple good things in JJ’s box
The videos Simon take charge of hit different, loved it!
Tobi's picture is a violation 😭😂 unacceptable.
This would be sick if each box was 100,000
I mean to be fair, Simon did say multiple times in his videos that he wanted to fix something up DIY, does it really matter if it's in the UK or Bulgaria?
This video was sick, after this we definitely we need a 100k per box man, everyone go like the video fam .
big ups harry for knowing the south african rand❤🇿🇦
good vid
This was an awesome one!
YOOOO! JJ is a fool man LMAO I am literally after crying tears of laughter for about 10 minutes straight. That box was so random and thrash OMG! LMAO
ethan chill 5:12
Musical chair brought upon a light in my depressed life lol 😅
Probably one of my favorite sidemen sundays
Need a pt2 more money this is golden
33:50
I love how annoyed Harry gets that he didn’t get Ethan’s box when in reality he could afford to buy everything in that box 100 times over 😂
Whats the song or soundtrack in min 25:58 please
Big up Josh for thinking about the mystery box as a mystery box. That man knows content.
What a super banger Sidemen Sunday by Simon. Genius 🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥 After a long time.
As a South African,  hearing Simon answer "bullet" for the currency question had me dead 😭😭
As south African I don't know how to feel
Harry broke another chair😂😂
Bro i have never laughed soo much in that musical chair
pov u take mrbeast thumbnail
Well didnt got to knew what simon picked from tobi's box....
what did simon pick from tobys box though??
uh yall, the math aint mathing 7 x 10k is not 100k w vid either way
i think it would be sick if simon goes to iran i believe its safe , he can also make a video out of it.
Ethan’s got crabs
please make these types of unique videos im sick of hide and seek and tours
Josh seemed more excited for the squashies than anything else
31:49 Ayo Ethan?
41:18 Mr. Krabs moment
amazing video!!!!
YOO BIRTHDAY SIDEMEN SUNDAY!!
One way ticket to afghanistan is crazy😂
Had to reload JJ's beanbag throw bare times 😂 Josh launching it first n then Simon nearly getting his head taken off was too much
I can see this reaching 100mil
Tobi on the Mario Cart is hella funny😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
This one a banger🎉
31:06 💀
Harry getting money is so ironic lmao
I beg he goes to Iran 😂😭😭😭
What's more better than watching YouTube is watching the sidemen on YouTube 🔥❤
Ethan always scratching his manhood
Best Sidemen video!! Had me in stitches! Loved every second of it!!!!!
Harry cashed in like he was Mr Money in the Bank lmaoooo
Ksi box wasn't to bad i like enything from eny box
Everyone’s talking abt the musical chairs but the cornhole game was SO FUNNY😭😭😭
Mid video for 100,000 spending on eachother budget
That football transition 👌
Sidemen never disappoints
have to pass driving test by 2001 to get the 50cc without cbt on license
18:10 DAMN Kon lost ALOT of weight omg
This could be a series and I wouldn’t mind
Kon looks like he’s lost a lot of weight
Everyone please get this video to 1 mil likes we need that 100k mystery box vid break the sidemen bank 😂😂😂
The corn hole was too funny. Especially when Josh followed JJ in just throwing it hard AF. 😂
What did Simon take from Tobi's box
Banger vid
It was calm styll
As someone that's from iran having a ticket to iran be a bad box item is very offensive. My country is beautiful
NEED MORE OF THIS🥴❤️❤️
They should've had 4x bad boxes, would've been way more interesting, or different budget boxes
Josh: Gets a good box Also Josh: “SQUASHIESSS”
Joshes box is hardddd
The rainbow road edit was too good
But what did Simon take from tobj?
stick to these kinds of videos😂😂😂😂
that was an amazing video, i love how when harry and ethan were the last two on musical chairs, the chair broke when harry sat on it XD Keep up the good work like u always do
the corn hole challenge needs to be made in to a full video was jokes
28:37 😂💀
Sick concept, some of the boxes were wavy
Vik's idea of putting real gold behind the fake gold and toilet paper was genius
“10k each 7 boxes…. 100k” missing 30k there
Yes! This is the new, original, funny sidemen content we want! But god please dont rinse this, keep it up as a 1 off special a few times a couple times a year and slowly increase the £££🎉😂
One of my favourite videos in recent times 😂😂
More money to people who don’t need it.  Although it was quite funny
Y u violate my country like tht Simon
give it a bear hug
Miniminter video in 6 months : I visit my home in Bulgaria
Simon's answer to what is the currency of South Africa hit way too close to home
Amazing!! Loved it!! Deffo need another version!!! I miss the shopping challenges
1 mil like? We got that 😊
Cool content
Cheap vs. Expensive video needs to happen with the cheap team going to Simons house in Bulgaria 😂
what did Simon take from Tobi's box
bro vikk buying gold is a indian parents thing lol.
We Indians Are Obsessed With GOLD😂🔥
Come on everyone. Let's get this to 1M 👍🏻
Sooo, this means Tobi can keep the chair?
They wont let that ksi image die lmao
I like the games more than the boxes. Cornhole was awesome.
If Harry's used his steal on Viks box he'd essentially have got two boxes as there was only really one thing in it
The boys popped off with this one
Do they reply
🙌
I am from Bulgaria and it was prety cool that Simon has a house there now 😂😂😂
Why is Ethan scratching his balls the whole video
Finally a good video
What did Simon steal
This has been my favourite vid in a while. Solid concept
Biggest banger 😂❤
31:16 Respectfully f*ck u simon 😂
great episode
One of my favorite episodes in a long time! Loved it!!
17:53 thats a sick transition. Good work on the editing team this video is s tier for sure.
2:55 The way Simon told JJ not to touch him had me rolling 😂
Simon with the South Africa violation but I'm here for it 😂😂
JME still showing up in the tunes!
WWWWW video
Simon, I'm a south African Nd I don't take offence to "bullets" but other people will 😂😂🤣🤣
I guess Ethan’s surgery has healed with all that jumping
5:11 Nah Ethan what u doin there💀💀🍆
Im done with JJ in these vids bro💀
Love the video please do it again
toby’s picture on the mystery boxes got me dead 😂😂
Kai must go done he support’s Russia
they should defo do this again, but with more money
The first box was from who?
My man said the currency of SA is bullets 😄
If that’s a real bear they need to be cancelled hunting is wrong and sick
15:00
General knowledge answers from harry and Simon were hilarious
One of the funiesy sidemen Sunday videos ever
Of course there was an ad before Harry took his shot 😂
One more 45+ minute video and I’m unsubbing
I don’t like viks new “who cares” attitude
One way ticket to Afghanistan mate, one way ticket to Afghanis :'DDDDDDDDDDDD
❤
Not Ethan Scartching his balls the whole video
One way ticket to Afghanistan is mental😂
Simon didn't get to take an item from tobi's box
aint no way bro bought a house in bulgaria
31:25  water
10 Minutes in and already it just feels like a video with the boys.  Love this vibe need more of it👏🏾
love it!
If I was Simon I would of killed myself 😂😂😂lol
let's gooooooooooo. Simon's coming to Irannnnnn
Better if we could see what they but
Bro I just flooded my house
9:21 was cold
🤣 Ethan digging for gold
Why was Vik holding his gold bar afterwards 🤔
This is the most sidemen sunday I've realllyy enjoyed in a while
Sidemen videos peaking again, to be fair that slapped.
Couldn't buy much I  the UK with dollars
WE NEED A PART 2 TO THIS!!😭
100% need to go visit that house lmao
Why's Ethan always groping himself. Just weird and gross
South African dollar😭no!!!!
JJ is still the most entertaining sideman by a landslide
Bullet for south african currency ,holy moly
didnt get tosee what simon picked from tobis box
Best Sidemen Sunday this Year
Simon saying "bullets" for our currency (South Africa) is mad😂
honestly a sick video
29:34 mistake!
sooo what item did simon steal??!
Why do they turn around ?
Harry is actually the most selfish of them all. Donny just gets away with it because he has millions of subs to a channel he hasn’t uploaded to in years, knob x
Simon forgot to swap items with tobi
Once I heard the end song repeating “vik” over and over that’s all I can hear 😅
harry and ethan in musical chairs cracked me up lmao
I'd be so gassed if I got Vik's box!
JJ being hella zesty
Sidemen so washed
Its good how they had 3boxes of good items/clothes 2 boxes that were 10k of gold or cash then Jj's Random box!😂
W vid
44:14 as a Bulgarian I did not expected this...
It's  Monnnneeeeeeyyyy !!!
Bro the way these dudes played musical chairs is allegro the way we could play in 2023
As entertaining as this video is. It's also truly sickening.  With the cost of living crisis going on and these multi millionaires picking boxes with stuff in that's mostly useless but stuff they can afford anyway
44:30 Simon should do it up on his main
pog
As a South African, point for Simon
Great video. What did Simon take off tobi 👀
Currency in South Africa... Bullet....   Me  as a South African: well hes not wrong....
What did simon choose from tobi's box?
that's a mistakeø
Come to iran mini minter 🎉🎉🎉
5:10 Ethan just casually massaging his groin in front of everyone
That Afghanistan plane ticket is legit , because I live here in herat Afghanistan, and that Kam air brand is from here 😅
As a South African I can confirm Simon was 98 percent correct..
this video is great
L VIDEO
Ethan is too much now
Shootout to Simon, has to be one of the best Sidemen video 💚
Simon never stole from Tobi
Harry sounds like he was in a  Yu-Gi-Oh episode 20:06 😂😂😂
30:46 One of Simon's Coldest Moments
silent library 3 pls
The Bois smashed it yet again always delivering ❤🎉
Beta Squad getting better guys
17:54 Who else flinched?
Spoiler shield , pin this
This video is goated
Glad simon got JJs, for the stubbornness throughout the video.
What’s South African currency?   Simon: Bullets lmaooo
Harry’s vibe was different this video and I loved it he was so chill and just a vibe while being hilarious the whole time
Yo lowkey id want to see this as like a monthly video on the channel this concept has a lot of potential for a series
I find it funny how tobi pretends to “talk to Jesus” he’s not a Christian… he sins in a lot of videos and I don’t see any sign of repentance
vik's box was good. A little mystery box
They are producing so much stinky content recently. Doesn’t surprise me that Ethan feels the way he does.
At least the next vacation video is sorted.
can everyone comment on this comment if u think sidemen should make a a seperate channel called sidemen sports where they do boxing and other sports
34:15 what's the song here? pls
"I'm older than FIFA"                       -Josh(Zerkaa)
I'm from South Africa and saying  bullets is our currency is a vio😂
Simons said he’s always wanted to do something up now he has his chance
This video was so good.  Jj's box was pure jokes.
Great content once again by Sidemen😅😎 hilarious stuff 🤣😂 Simon did South Africa wrong with the currency😅 I'm a proud South African😎
This video is a BANGER Hard to find a dull moment They've killed it
one of my favorite sidemen sundays
this needs atleast 200,000$ episode again
Bro that thumbnail is wierd but attractive
5:12 Ethan squeezing his phallus whilst saying lube 😂😂
14:56 this edit what eeeeveeen
Finally a funny video😂😂
The chair breaking in musical chairs had me creasingggg 😭😭
Best vid in a while
I’m actually too poor to enjoy the sidemen
wth the bad box is actually really good, i would be so happy man
jj’s box😂
Tobys really jarring lately doesn’t know how to have fun
Great video, although would like another holiday one with jj and Harry on same team
This sidemen Sunday was one of the best in this year
Very very sick video idea! 100% need to do this again
When they broke the chair😂 i lost it
What did Simon take from Tobi’s box
Did Simon take anything from Tobi’s box?
tobys pic is amazing
Ngl this was a banger
20:00 lashes is racially motivated
❤❤❤❤
More of this and less hide and seeks
Ethan got the 🦀🦀🦀
Ksi + mail = blackmail
31:51 whoever came up with this was on demon time this is actually evil 💀
The hovercraft hitting Ethan in the face as he was getting off had me dying for no reason 😂😂😂
Ethan’s jarring af scratches his balls every 10 seconds
This was top tier
40:00 Josh is a Genius literally
32:12 The zest 😭😭 38:26 JJ's a menace to society
“What is the currency of South Africa?” Bullet 😂😂😂
8:08 nah im dead the way it hit ethans face 😭😭
Hands down best video yet 🙌🏼
WE NEED ANOTHER ONE OF THESE 🔥🔥
why is vik funny now😂😂😂😂😂
I see that they post and it gives me pure happiness ❤❤❤
"IT'S MONEY!!!" 41:04 😂😂
Jesus Kon’s weight loss is mental
Ethan scumbagged the musical chairs grabbing onto Simon and Vikk etc just to win the game. Its childish is all I am saying
My favourite video in quite a while it was jokes😂
The musical chairs 😂
They have to make a video where they go to Bulgaria and do up the place
TBH - after all is said and done ... THIS VIDEO IS A BANGER !!!!  ... Serious ... this was hilarious to see all the interaction and responses. Thanks boys !!!
I cried at the tickets. Salam alaikum ! Youre going to Afghanistan!!
"envy is a sin, envy is a sin, I will not be envious"😂😂😂
Not me planning my wedding with R50 (South African currency) in my account and them messing about with 100k 😂😂  - edit:not them asking the SA currency in the vid 😂😂
10/10  sidmen vid
Best video I’ve seen in a while 🔥
Does anyone know the name of the song at 34:14
Loved it pls do another
God I hate it when Ethan and Harry grabs there junk then touch their face and others hands. Especially Ethan, like go take a shower if it's that's itchy.
Good to see Simon and all the boys together !
7 x 10000 = 100000
Enjoyed every second
Musical chairs 😂😂 oh my god ethan ethan ethan ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This was actually very entertaining. These recent videos have been very funny. Keep up the good work ❤
Best sidemen video in a while icl
bored of these mr beast style edits
All 7 together after so long
What did Simon pick from Tobi's box?
27:14
Now Simon can do a main channel video where he visits the house which Jj bought for him.
The employee who switched should be fired
No cap I would’ve been SO hype for the house in Bulgaria. By far the most random and funny thing in there. Such an odd flex.
No guest 😭?? Normally every sidemen Sunday they have a gust 😭??
Why is my man ethan grabbin his d*ck every time in every video bruv, then he touches the others wtf
31:19 bro said we use bullets🤣🤣🤣
Josh can't play musical chairs
Ethans wins ????
Can Ethan go get some tea tree body wash for his jock itch, man can't stop touching is balls, obviously it's a sweaty mess down there!
As a South African, Simons "bullets" comment was spot on 😂
loved the video, so funny
nah this is actually a banger. the suspense is fuckin amazing
Best vid of the year!
This was legendary . Harry breaking the chair and summoning a steal😂 the editor should be proud too.👏🏻 sidemen never miss . The best in the business
15:12 😂
One of the best videos 😂😂
31:49 Yoo Ethan😂
I love how harry sang Skepta and wizkid song 😂
JJ fr got one way tickets to afghanistan, haiti, iran & russia… nah i’m dead 💀

Simon is gonna visit me soon in Afghanistan 🎉🎉

when the chair broke that was hilarious
This vid was 🔛🔝
14:23. Did Ethan say friend🤔
Yo my girlfriend is from Russia, can I get that ticket Simon? Preferably to Rostov or somewhere close. thanks.
Banger
29:34 gee i wonder if simon will get the first point, thanks for spoiler chip lol
Ayo Simon come to Iran
the cornhole game had me almost die of laughter 🤣🤣
One of the funniest
9:28 comedy
We need more of these videos
One of the best sidemen Sundays in a while for sure
Lost respect for these guys after that stuffed bear and defending it instead of being shocked.
This is a great twist on the Sidemen spend money on each other idea
WHAT ETHAN DOING
ABSOLUTE BANGER, I was getting a bit worried of some stinkers but I definitelly recommend doing more of this content!
Banger
Ksi's outfit clearly says blackmail 😂😂
couldn't have had a more perfect ending with simon getting jj's box, w vid
Banger
i know the tickets are one way but i would be happy to go there anyway 😭
Josh’s box made by Ethan and Ethan’s box made by Harry had the best stuff IMO lol
Did simon end up picking an item from Tobi his box?
@5:10 ethan gettin a lil too excited when he sees that lube 🤌🏻🤌🏻
one way tickets😭
such a good concept and execution omg I love this vid
As an Iranian fan I must say, the one way ticket to Iran was actually really good 😂😂
32:00 simon's face🤣🤣
what did simon take from tobi?
Harry looking really good and so happy these days. Keep up the good work!!
Damn jj back at it again with the All White and Black Socken Outfit.
Absolutely loved this one
Already funnniest vid in a minute😂
There is always this myth that vic is more intelligent than the rest of them, thats why any general knowledge questions make vic sweat!
Wait, what did simon take from tobi's box?
Best sdmn video in a while

Outro music had me jump off the sofa and start jamming with my dog lol
hanv't veen finished the video, but this is a FIRE idea. good stuff sidemen
28:17 had me crying all these cool expensive things and JJ's most upset about the squashies 😭
1 million likes for a bigger version of this? Sure.  Let's go.
Genuinely laughed so hard at musical chairs, just bog and behz going at it

5:10 🤨
the musical chairs 😂😂😂
the best bit was musical chairs

Oh my days, the final round of musical chair was absolute madness 🤣😭
The musical chairs😂
im convinced JJ was a absolute baller at football at the age of 5
12:20 *should have
9:21 😂
This is was utterly hilarious! 😂 could not stop laughing this video is such a good idea
Why is Ethan itching his balls all the time?
Why did it end like that? Without picking something from tobis box
I would have loved to watch them buy the stuff for the mystery boxes
I want to see KSI cut out in Simons stream room
harry is happier for 10k cash than he was for 2.7 mil private jet
41:18 mr crabs moments😂
They really don’t know what content to make now
The irony of the po box riding a penny farthing..that's the lick!!😎
Can everyone pls look at Kon at 18:12 That boy straight out told JJ 😂
nowadays beta squad> honestly
Can i get ethans go kart
Love this concept, pls do again
I feel like they should get randy and the boys to fill the boxes for the sidemen to open
Someone tell the editor it’s should have 😂
banger
Kon looking fit 💪🏼
The musical chairs was pure comedy
General knowledge 🫡
Banger boys!!
bullets? as a South African I don't know how to feel about that lmfao
Whenever the Sidemen play Cornhole, it's a dub.
3:17 watching this on repeat
Millionaires getting excited over $10,000...pocket change I guess.
Great video concept
I like their new videos ,this video was top tier
Simon just casually dissing South Africa 😂 much love to SA 🇿🇦
Brühl, i wanted to see What Simon would’ve picked from tobi
5:11 cheeky ball scratch

Harry is cute @20:07 😂. "I activate the steal"
I am from Bulgaria 🇧🇬 and this absolutely mad
Great video 🎁
Come to iran bro I'll show u the best things u could ever see in your life ❤️
I feel like this is the most fun JJ has had recording a video 😂
Sidemen holiday to Simmons new house
how are bot accounts making comments relevant to the video?
Nah JJ is ruthless 😂
This was actually a sick video idea
This was just pure elite dub Sunday
This vid was class
Not to bad of a swing just slow the back swing a little the rest will come
legit banger no cap allow it
Everyone else: We're buying mystery stuff for the house today. Vikkstar123: We're investing in gold today.
One of the best videos I’ve seen in a long time funny engaging and stupidness
❤ unreal video! A mystery box challenge part.2 with fans?
Why does Ethan always touch/ scratch his balls thinking it’s cool? He comes across like he has an STI or a problem. Disgusting.
Good choice taking the telescope
Could of done without seeing Ethan itching his balls 😅 the painting didn’t get enough hype! This is one of the best sidemen’s in a while because there all here as well!
That was elite boys 👌👌
Great video. Already want another one!
This video was hype, the musical chairs had me  in tears 😂😂😂
44:16 i've seen that house 💀💀💀💀
I really loved the last round of the dancing chair
🇿🇦🇿🇦❤️‍🔥
I hope this video goes viral I loved it so much
𝕀𝕟𝕥𝕖𝕣𝕖𝕤𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕘
Next sidemen video Simon is spending the night in his “new home”😂
Simon saying bullets are South Africa's currency was absolutely hilarious and a pretty damn good shout! XD
THE BEST SIDEMEN VIDEO EVER
Simon could renovate his new Bulgaria home as a YouTube video 😂😂😂. Ut wouldn't be bad.
We need more likes on this video!
?DERBI DRD 50CC MOTORBIKE how the bike is 1000 pounds and they acting like they cant get even a better version wtf?
with fans?
I think it is safe to say that josh is the best sidemen in terms of planning videos
21:00 JJ be the type of person to pay God 5K for everything in life!
Lol Ethan sees the lube and start playing with himself 😂
So who got who's box ?
Would love to see one with vieuwers and they team up with a sidemen member or maby would love to join and  and see them do something with vieuwers like the.old shopping vids
Simon and Tobi never made there deal
Nooo this video is a banger after a while
Yooooooooo

I loved this style of video. More of this kind of stuff please
What did Simon pick from Tobis box
this was so good
ngl this video was hella good for this channels standards lately. really enjoyed it compared to the last few weeks of sidemen content
That gave me old school sidemen video vibes best video In a while
.
The best video of 2023 easily, very enjoyable
Nintendo Wii 325£ 😂
Loved this concept 👍
nothing better than watching sidemen Sunday on Sunday before school
that kinda got me 😂😂 17:53
They should do a storage wars with teams and and see who gets the most money afterwards
SIDEMEN $100,000 MYSTERY TAX WRITE OFF
Vikstar doing the most indian thing that indians do when they have money…buy gold😂😂
W video that's it and that's all😂😂
New Title: - "Multimillionaires buy themselves expensive presents under the guise of "creating content" so they can write the cost off as expenses in the Sidemen Ltd accounts."  Love the guys and what they have achieved but got to admit that the videos are stale and boring now. New some new formats or ideas.
Congrats on your first property Simon!!😅
38:42 the fact that he got it first try too
PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE
Ethan and Harry are like siblings fighting for that chair. I've never laughed so much in months
Oh my god loved this video so much❤
damn sidemen would usually easily pull 1M in a hour
Ethan at 5:12 😂😂
Simon needs to do a video series renovating the Bulgarian house 👀
what a video
ethan just scratching his sack through the entire video and no one noticed
The musical chairs was hilarious 🤣
Best video this year
What’s wrong with tickets to Haiti Iran and Russia? Like I understand  Afghanistan but what’s the problem with others?
So what did simon get from tobi?
It got me dead at 37:00
jjs box was actually surprisingly funny😂
I like how JJ spends more than 10 tries, trying to land the sack in the hole, and then Tobi just sinks it in his first try 💀
Caught my boy tobi dabbing in the goalie in 2023 that’s crazy
Reach that 1M likes soon...we want each box 100 bags play❤️
JJs box was the one 😂😂😂
Y’all are da Goats
It’s always good to see all the boys together in a video
Good vid
Vikk getting his own books was amazing
would be jokes if one of the boxes have 10k worth of greggs sausage roll or something along those lines
Www
Definitely need a pt2 on this 😂😂
This is the life. Mint being able to do this as a video
jj box was mad
good vid
i just think there must be an idea of a new video sidemen build thier own house in bulgarija
The one way ticket to Afghanistan has me floored. Who even thinks of that? 🤣🤣
Good vid, keep it up ❤❤❤
look at ethan with his colleagues 😂
Thank lowercase god Simon is back
I like that Vik's trying to take all the gold back to where it belongs little by little!!
Dope vid boys

Simon asked Harry for 50 pounds is hilarious :))
5:10 Ethan doing some crazy stuff…
I want a 100k one
NGL  ...  I love Harry .. but i loved when Ethan pushed him off brooo .like instant karma... When Ethan fell .. i felt pain watching him bro ... Harry had that coming brother
Best video y’all have put out in quite a while
7 x 10,000 = 100, 000. The math isn't mathing and the brain isn't braining
Can I have the one way ticket to Afghanistan?
Can't wait to watch Freya's reaction tomorrow!
4:16 KSimon
I wonder what Simon took from Tobi’s box
Tobi: *wins* Tobi: "I don't like this"
How can they violate us like that😔 our currency is “bullets”, what else no electricity 💔
Thats a video idea for simon to fix his house in bulgaria
Another banger Sidemen Sunday.
where is the house in Bulgaria i am from there
They didnt say what simon picked from tobis box 😞😞
In which town or village is the house in Bulgaria because i am from there xd
Ethan got actually a stunning box for josh
Jj fully deprived some homeless guy in Bulgaria of a home for joke in a video
What's Hustler's university?
should've = should have, not should of 💀☠☠
This was a great video nice too be something different
I loved when simon picked a thing from tobi's box 😂
Kilimanjaro is also in Kenya
12:22 Instant Karma for Harry for 4:15 and Why is an American adding captions 'Should of'????what
W VIDEO this gave me old sidemen feels 😭😭
Brooooo this video bangs🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂❤
‏‪44:02‬‏ im from iran and i don't get it man  so a ticket to Iran is bad?
Where did they get their Nintendo Wii from? EBay? £325 on release day maybe, but that's worth like £50 nowadays
Get this video a million likes people we know we can do this
Best plot twist would be JJ doing a genuinely amazing box for once - be good content too
What did Simon chose from Tobi’s box?
Did Simon get anything from Tobi's box?
Ethan scratching himself whilst saying “it’s a load of lube”
I dont even care wat happens afterwards that musical chairs was amazing
Funn😂😂
the Simon tickets got me thinking one thing, sidemen Sunday?
Hustlers University 😂
36:27 what happened to JJ
I forgive Simon for saying bullets😂😂🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Actually one of the best ideas in a while imo
Please can I buy the motorbike, so I can make some awesome content with it on the channel ?? 😮😮🙏
Sidemen has been BANGERS after BANGERS lately. Am glad we can all put that horrible Stag Do video behind us and finally enjoy some real content. Keep it up bois!!
Ethan looks like a dad
Yes do this again!
This is a banger I hope they do more of these, imagine having 100k per person
Kon’s looking leeeeeeaaaan!!!
LOVING THE LOW CAMERA ANGLES 😂
AYOOO ETHAN 31:48 😂
Harry knows Ethiopia. YAY
screen shotted the plane ticket, off to Afghanistan. Later!
How does 7 boxes of 10k equals to 100k?
One of the best videos in a while!!!
Ethan seems to be having fun with his colleagues
No one: Vik every round: “well statistically…”
This concept is so good, best sidemen Sunday in a while, we need this challenge with 50 or 100k!!
The absolute joy from harry getting money while simon is so sad is fuking funny ngl
Did anyone notice bazinga keep having a scratch ?
😂😂😂 love it.deffo got to do the £100.000 box challenge now 😮
KSI IS SCAMMING LIKE HIS PRIME PARTNER!💀
this video was gold another sidemen (and simon im pretty sure banger) Josh getting good karma and simon getting the one way tickets was hilarious. Poor harry but at least he can buy his items again and ethan and him can race around 😂
What did Simon take from Tobis box
What did Simon choose from Toby's box?
Vik's joke abt Toby loving a canvas😂😂
The piano and telescope was definitely Vik’s box
I swear this video was an hour long. What happened?
Would have been good to see them buy the stuff,, but wicked video
Didn't even show what Simon stole from tobi
I woulda just bought 10 grand worth of cement

this was a nice video!
someone tell me why 17:53 forced my heart out of my chest
Proof that Harry is ## 8:14
But what did Simon take from Tobi's box?
This SIDEMEN sunday feels like classic SIDEMEN 🔥🔥🔥
Lets get this to 1 mill likes to get 1 million mystery box challenge!
I beg they do this again with 100k each box and maybe that is the best time to do their next collab with Mr Beast and let him choose everything for each box
31:49 Ethan is going nuts xDDDD
9:13 can bro ever take an L without making some lame excuse 💀
Video would have been similar without vik, he was not doing anything
They should have added the buying portion too, i love watching them
whoever subtitled 12:25 should be fired
Bro vikks vibes is dead
One of my favorite videos in a min💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
good video
let me get the iphone sidog
ETHAN WASH UR CROTCH AND COME
best sidemen Sunday of the year so far

It's always nice seeing the sidemen spend money.
Simon and JJ being golden in this video!
Ethan’s got crabs it seems
What did Simon choose from tobi's box??
41:15 best  moment
Now do one where all the boxes are bad.
hit and miss, could've been done better
Simon Should go to all four countries and make a vlog and rate them Iran is underrated af
This video was unreal🔥🔥🔥
Simon should make a video with Talia in his new home
think a heist/code-breaking video would slap now after that!
The BEST sidemen Sunday in a long time y'all good job
The amount of times they said "box" and all the little inuendos are hilarious 😂😂😂
Sidemen fell off
vikk did th most indian thing i've ever seen, buying gold omg i love him
100k each box would be sick to watch - live vicariously through the video
The musical chairs finale was one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen
Please do 100K a box
Did Simon get the chance too steal from Tobi's box I would have taken the massage chair everday of the week
Good video ❤ I need the 100k asap😂
love how theyre getting pissed even though they can literaly go and buy anything they want from all the boxes anyway lmao
Wait so what did Simon get from tobi
W video
4:53 @LifeofTom

A bunch of MrBeast thumbnail copycats, now I'm waiting for these sideboys to fall apart
12:56 Ethan: “An ice bath” Simon: “U are meant to mix that with the toaster”  Simon’s way too clever 😂 that line was hilarious
Bro got the TATE subscription fckin hell 😂
Claim your here before 7000 years card

They didn't show what Simon chosed from Tobi box...
We will never know what simon stole

Tobi prayed for Jesus and got the Last Supper Sidemen Edition. Jesus loves 🤩

100,000,000,000,000 per box
The Ronaldo boot. Unreal box that was
This was a GREAT FANTASTIC W video
Vikk was planning the box like a straight up villain 💀
7 sidemen and 10k each equals 100,000$?
9:26

That was fun video. Absolutely amazing 👏
the most lazy video in a while.
Why is jj wearing af1s doesn't he have a deal with adidas
Really cool idea for a video lads
So what did Simon pick from Tobi's box?
20:56 cutest frame ❤️
Vikk being smart with his box and Josh instantly outsmarting his box was 🔥🔥
Harry looking like hes gonna cry when he didnt steal off behz... Get wrecked 😂😂😂

Sick execution.

Honesty I miss the old sidemen. I just watch their super old vids now for nostalgia.
Funniest game of last to leave the chair
Best Musical Chairs Ever!!!!

harry breaking the chair was so funny
The sidemen just dropped a banger video !! The best entertaining and funniest video after a long long time 🎉🎉😂❤
Absolute banger but ofc it aint gonna get views , fk these sdmn fans
I'm sad nobody knows my country Tanzania 🥲
Ethan needs to stop grabbing his junk and making eye contact with his friends
KSI FACE 😐.... DURING JOSH MISTRY BOX😂😂💯💯

5:11 ain't no way we ignoring what Ethan did 💀💀
Bro did Ethan have a hamster in his pants? What is he tryna grab
Last few videos have been soooo much better. Please steer away from the cringe dating style videos and repeating the same cheap v expensive videos and keep with these original and genuinely entertaining videos. Last 5 have been some of the best this whole year after a string of the stuff I just mentioned that was not entertaining and made me switch off within 10 mins.
Vik did typical Indian thing 😂😂
Yesss sirrrr😂
a ticket to iran ...
Who’s is who’s box?
Banger vid
One of the best vids ........
They should do a video surprising Kon with something. Guy is the backbone of the group! Drop a like for Kon!
I still remember ksi being in tgf bro🫂💯
I knew the chair was going to break 😂
8:11 was the funniest 😂poor Ethan 😂
Good to see Ethan and his fellow colleagues
Sidemen video idea, they go to Bulgaria to fix the house up 😂😂

😴
One of the sidemen’s best videos over the past 3 years
Loved this video man😂
Sick vid ❤️
i think that simons home in bulgaria should be used in a 100000 vs 100 pounds holiday xD
What was the turning around for? Were they putting the stuff in the box after it was picked?
18:12 ayeeee kon lost hella weight, big ups to him
Simon didn't choose anything from Tobi's box
W video
What did Simon pick from Tobi's box? Did I miss that, or was it not shown?
But what did Simon pick?
Best video of the year by far
This was so fun to watch, actually one of the best this year for me.
Banger

Simon brings such a good vibe when it’s his video 🙌
Kon's lookin massive btw
Does Ethan have crabs? He stays itching himself
Stealing syndicates chair 😂😂
Wish they showed them actually using the stuff or where they have put it at home
Harry had the chance to steal anything and chose a telescope 😂
What is bluewater 💀
Best of the month so far! OMG!
This is the best video, not only in sidemen history but on YouTube.
Ju is the only one who would try to bribe the crew
Who spotted my Painting 👀
The sak throwing game was goated i couldnt stop laughing 😂😂😂
Nahhh this guys are the best 😂
Honest.y .love this video idea!!! Please do more of these
Who is this ksi guy haven’t seen him around in ages

The musical chairs section is by far the funniest part of the video with JJ’s extremely slow reaction time to Ethan pushing everyone off and Harry breaking the chair at the end 🤣
sick video
NGL this vid actually bangs wow loved it can we have a nother one plzzz❤❤
lets get 1m likes for 100k box

I really enjoyed the part where Simon picked something from Tobi's box.
There’s no way a wii is worth £325
Absolute banger🎉🎉
hi  🐀 💩🚬
Petition for Simon to do up the house in Bulgaria and make a video for his main channel
No one gonna talk about how this has got the exact same thumbnail as mr beasts video
lmao simons had an absolute rotter compared to others, ngl wouldve been sick if jj came after that saying that sint his actual box and bought a new one which has crazy item in it
Such a great idea, and so funny😂
JJ's box had me cryin, Home in Bulgaria and a one way ticket to Afghanistan 😭
after a long time I enjoyed a sidemen Sunday
I live right beside blw sooo me and my brother u will see us there..
Actually a class vid for once
Actually kinda surprised that JJ wanted the bike tbh
I literally was smiling the entire video with suspense.
Great logic from Simon in the Intro... 7 sidemen spending £10k each to total $100k... It actually totals just under $90k 😂😂
The editing on this video is amazing
Shout out to the editors one of the best editing 😂❤️❤️
If somebody else would've chosen Vikk's box , it could've been a great moment for the video . Especially someone like Harry, Ethan or JJ . They would've just pissed & started ranting only to realise that they are getting 10k worth of good 😂
Nah that's a one of the greatest videos
31:14
I'm still waiting for Simon to choose something from Toby's box💀
31:17💀💀
Watch what u say about South Africa Simon...we watching
The musical chairs made me laugh I have laughed hard in 2 weeks
Simon quickly knowing that it wasnt ksi who chose the stuff but his assistant 😂 trying to get him a yellow😂
7 x 10,000 is 100,000 now?
This video is a banger
Gassed for Josh! 🎉
Vikk and harry are clear
Thank God it's not hide and seek
i liked thisvideo
Wow they even used the same thumbnail mr beast used 2 years ago lol
Harry stole the telescope but I’ve seen him use the golf clubs in Theo bakers new video 😂
Simon gotta go to bulgaria
Mid Vid
5:10 to 5:14 Ethan scratching his balls.... This is gold 😂😂😂😂
As an Afghan living in Afghanistan I think it's jokes that jj got a one way ticket  I approve
Man, This was really good video. I love surprises and mini games and that last was soo damn funny especially the tickets.
Bro the cornhole had my dyingggg. Reminds me of old school YouTube when people would do that just for an entire video. More please :)
18:11 AYOOOO KON BEEN DOING A MADNESS IN THE GYM MANS CHISELEDDD
Ksi is a BOT 👾🤖
They should do the next one with subscribers
What about the one thing that Simon should or take from Tobi
Nice to see Ethan having so much fun with his work colleagues
yo lads fancy giving me the table pretty please with a cherry on top
part 2 ASAP
gg
simon man come to Iran there are plenty of landmarks and mind blowing sightseens.
Amazing show full of surprises and entertainment. Tnx4sharing. Watching from DUBAI
but we didn't get to see what simons stealing from tobi tho
Genuine contender for vid of the year
Seems Ethan’s having alot of fun with his supposed ‘colleagues’ 😑
pls do this with 100k each. It would be sooo sick.
Josh knowing 212 has made my day
When he said Afghanistan, that hit me in the heart
SIMON SHPULD MAKE A SERIES ON DOING UP THAT BULGARIA HOME!!
the 4 plane tickets sent me
W con
this is a banger
harry lookin slim
This was awesome, hope they do another one soon...
great video
what did Simon pick from Tobi's box ?
Damn vikks box was actually had a fun idea about it!
Ayo, Kon's looking kinda good y'know
Ethan got bare STDs or something? Non stop grabbin his meat!
the edit really ruined it by telling us who picks which before we get there
JJ’s box had me dying from the plane tickets to hustlers university that was hilarious
Get it to one mill likes guys
Ksi git his get back 😂😂 if simin didn't get married, ksi wouldve been happy and now so depressed when he choose what to put in that  box
Why’d they have to turn around before opening? I don’t get it
what was the blured thing in tobi's box?
i wanted to see what simon got from tobi’s box
Honestly 1 of the BEST Sidemen vids.. Truly a banger🔥🔥🔥
9:21 pure class from harry
So what is the point ???
can i have the ticket to afghanistan please?
It was script af but actually it has its funny moments
For those wondering... 1st box Simon 2nd box Harry 3rd box Tobi 4th box Ethan 5th box Vik 6th box Josh 7th box KSI
ive never seen harry so happy and im so happy for him
Bro got a ticket to Afghanistan
Simon should hand me the house he got in my country, I would repair it
The Musical Chairs made my week 😂❤
I love the interaction with the crew
To all the mfs who say money can't buy happiness....hold that🖕🏻
JJ is alot 😂😂😂
Harry slowly getting sadder after Ethan takes his box might be the funniest thing this year.
One of favourite style of vid. Need a part 2
Jjs box looked bad but was actually cool😂😂
Such a good video! Hopefully it gets good views so we can see another!
What did Simon pick from Tobi's box?
The currency of our country 🇿🇦 is bullets huh Simon🤨😂
can we get a behind the scenes of when they were ordering all these stuff on moresidemen?
Harry already broke something 😭
Lol the musical chairs 😂😂😂😂
this was a banger! finally not another hide and seek
Such a random thing to hear as a Bulgarian  that they bought a building in Bulgaria 😅😅
The corn hole was too funny
JJ enjoying his man getting spanked tho 😏
we need 100k one
not the One way ticket to afghanistan I'M CRYING
This is 100% going to be an unpopular opinion but i didnt really like the box josh got… most of it was pretty much vanity items like clothes or shoes. Atleast simon got an iphone, best box id say is ethans… id say i have similar taste to harry on what id spend 10k on, ethan got a fuckin dirt bike!!!
next video idea musical chair with forfeits
bullets? I'm South African, he's not wrong
What did Simon take from Toby’s box ?
33:52 Smash that like button!
Banger
This video was great! This is why they need to try new styles of videos.
that musical chairs is one of the funniest things I've ever seen
Such a good video even tho not typical sidemen sunday
Loved this, clean, simple not over produced and really funny
Miniminter needs to do a video of him visting  his property in Bulgaria
28:15 that’s what she said
why is vic blue
Its " I should have stolen." Come on. We can't  be telling the English the correct English.
proudly south african
19:55 Ethan telling a black man he deserves lashes is crazzzzyyyyyy 😂😂😂😂
Finally a new Sidemen vid idea instead of repeating the same thing time after time
This new Vimon couple is so cute together
Would love to see a storage wars spinoff
Tbf Harold really did well for his mystery box. He's matured quite well ya know.
Am I the only one confused as to why they were turning around after a box was picked?
Awesome video, more like this pls
vik wasnt trolled for once, im happy
Cool one
ill take the home in bulgaria
Awesome need another one of this,  was good
Iran 💚🤍❤️
Sick
Josh won icl
JJ always stiffs someone, when its his chance to buy gifts for someone else, but would expect big things in gift😅
another terrible video, time to unsubscribe
One of your best videos! And that's saying a lot.
ethan couldnt stop scratching his balls
Vik making a joke about Tobi loving boxes😭😂
Does anyone know what Simon took from Tobi box
Imagine getting fired from Sidemen
Someone check Ethan for std’s the way he’s always on his wiener
Can't lie this video was a masterpiece
Watching Ethan and harry play musical chairs is such a highlight of this video 😂
W vid 💯
We want josh with a mustache
Simon is now a lanky millionaire and now even a home owner in Bulgaria absolute legend
Is there going to be 7 videos on moresidemen where they show the POV of the them buying it?
For the algorithm
The one way ticket to Afghanistan💀
Sidemen never disappoint
vikk knowing kenya is a good thing for kenyans
Not the best vid but at least all 7 of them were in it
This is so. Funnny
Thia might be one of the best videos imop
29:25 - " _General Knowledge_ " Lmao😂😂
The fact jjs box was last is just perfect
Mid
what did simon choose from tobi
🇿🇦
So vikk basically just bought an investment to himself
BRO WHAT DID SIMON STEAL FROM TOBI?
We have to get this to 1 mill likes❤
On what planet is a Nintendo Wii £325? Pricing is more rigged than Kenny's fights.
I really liked this video, it’s really nice to see all the boys together (no shade to the guests lool)
Harry put the boozzz down 😅
Bro south African currency is Rands  :   South African dollar's  Bullets  🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀
Simon the Currency here is South Africa is actually dagga
Yo
BANGER
cornhole while they were blindfolded was tooo funny
omg ur opening the store on my birthday I wish could go
Miniminter can stay with my extended fam in Afghanistan 😂😂😂
This is sick
Anotha smasha!!
One of the funniest video  We need part 2  100K $ a box
is it just me or does vic not care about the videos anymore?? he seems to be more mean towards them and saids "i dont even care" more so than he has in the past? just my opinion.
9:30 that musical chairs game 😂😂
The musical chair part had me crying 😂😂😂😂
What did Simon take from Tobi?
greatest video in a while, really enjoyed it!
What did Simon pick?
jj casually bribing the crew
Yo Ethan handling his rocket at 5:13
SIMONS BACK!!1
HELLO SIMON FORGOT TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM TOBI ! !
Someone tell Ethan to stop rubbing his junk.
whats with ethan rubbing his d**k every other shot of him?XD
This with 100k a box would be wild.
Hustlers university after this video 📈📈
Do it again but let the Troops pick the boxes!!!!!
Harry’s reaction to money is priceless
7 times 10000 = 100000?
Banger
Pure comedy.
I honestly haven't laughed this much in a long time ... couldn't even hold my laughs in
A wii is like £80 not 350
They should have let jj pay the guy the 5k and then just get Harry to steal anyways🤣 the guy gets 5k and Ksi loses so the sidemen win🤷🏻‍♂️
me personally i think JJ trying to buy the best box makes the video better 🤷‍♂️
Simon should do a video where he goes to his house in Bulgaria
finally a video with only the 7 sidemen
Such a banger video
“What is the currency of South Africa” Harry: “Bullets”😃
Is that code of the ticket to Afghanistan readable😂😂
Ethan moving mad sus
Banger video
I cant breathe from the musical chairs😂😂. I was crying
ethan stop grabbing ur thing 5:12
Ayyy josh even pronounced TANZANIA correctly 🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🎉
That ksi box man, definitely a ksimon coincidence
Bring speed to 20v1
3:55 FIRE JOKE FROM BEHZ, THEY SLEPT ON IT
Why does ethan grab himself every few minutes
YouTube Goats. 🐐
Need a 100k version of this
This has to be a 1/10
That game of musical chairs 😂😂😂
Finnaly a good vid no affence I just like these vidoes

Vik and Josh were on the same wavelength.
One of the best vids
I'm in Bulgaria give me the address I'll go have a look maybe now your lawn for £1
2:50 that’s someone’s husband 😂😂😂😂

The best video they've released in about a year
best sidemen sunday of the year so far
Forgot to blur the willy at 6:32😆
I mean its  "AIGHT"😅😅
love it when it is just the 7 of them
Josh need that w lol
Good to have Simon back
the best sidemen sunday in a while
This is a great video but this would of been even better if it was more like storage wars. Go about a storage place all together have a set amount of money each and can bet on a container or even a car option one then a race would be sick.
Love this format of video!! Lol JJ just gave Simon a bunch of main channel video fuel: 4 trips and a house renovation!!
KSIs new name : BLACK- MAILMAN
I was expecting JJ's box to be far worse, really enjoyed this vid could watch so many of these
45:36 Best Mystery box video on YouTube to date surpasses mrbeast too for me ,Great job
JJ showing us he actually likes Top G! 🎉😂🎉
Banger
Banging
This was my favorite video in a while😂
this was a amazing video!
This is the best sidmen sunday in a good while, nice one
Love it 😂😂
I love how the sidemen can do anything they want to JJ and him just taking it ...meanwhile if it's with other people like Tommy or his fighting opponents, if those would shove socks in his face.. LMAO hell would break loose xd
One way 😂
31:50 🤨📸
I Wish Someone else got Vik’s Box
Of course JJ tried to bribe one of the staff members.
This is crazy 😂😂😂
Use this as a we need a part 2 button
Simon gets JJ's box!! 😂
Another Banger video from the boys!!😂😂😂😂😂
Out of all the boxes minter had to choose jj . Thats real love😢❤
What was the function of everyone turning around after choosing a box?
Vik talking about matching the painting with stuff in your house, this man is basically married already
Colleagues
Absolutely loved this video
Damn Simon doing my country's currency so dirty  "bullets"😂😂😂😂😂
We need sidemen storage wars, or sidemen antiques road show
Sidemen opening a shop on my birthday 🎉🎉😂
Might be their best vid yet
14:55 The sidemen editor needs a raise for this masterpiece 🙌
great video
Ethan needs to sort his crabs out 😂
Harry had the best box 📦
Ethan most spoiled sidemen now Lmao
🎉
This video was sick
Imagine if Harry used his steal on Vik's box LOL
When vik bought gold . We Indians respect him .
Such a fire video!!!
It's nice to see Ethan spending time with colleagues.
So what did Simon get from Tobi??
That transition where Ethan shot the ball was amazing and scary (jumpscare) at the same time! 17:50
Vikk showcasing his Indian roots by buying gold... 😂😂
All of  this video is sus😂😂
6:44 the way Harry snatched them socks 17:54 that just scared ts outta me 21:31 that look ethan and tobi gave each other I’m crying 24:44 keep it going going 33:03 “I’m older than fifa” LMFAOO 36:27 I would’ve chose tobi too tbh
Josh has never been this happy in a video
The Bulgaria home is actually a sick gift for Simon. He can do a remodeling series now
That was good boys I enjoyed that 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
Viks the goat man got himself the real gold such smart play!
Godlyy!!
The Tickets got me not gonna lie
I waited hours for this
Vikk did such an India thing and bought gold with his money. Solid investment!
Honestly, a great vid 😂😂
💣
Why did they have to turn around?
Vikk putting in the extra effort😂😂😂
Fire vid
Did simon take from tobi
29:39 Spoiler😅
Strange content
Holy the musical chairs was the funniest thing ever, i can not stop laughing
Big up Bulgariq <3
Vickstar did no mystery box but a treasure hunt 🤣but Harry's "It's money"!!
The best musical chairs, could be on more sidemen.
Simon connection with ksi is destiny 😂
amazing bloody video
KSI just as surprised to see what was hidden in his box
Vikk's box was gonna be a banger if another person got it.  Would have been jokes
Great vid honestly so funny
By far one of the best Sidemen Sundays they've done in awhile
The most entertaining video i have seen in a while
Vik yelling he got his box was hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂
What is the blurred thing in tobi's box?
i wanna play musical chairs now
This would’ve been a perfect video to do with Mr Beast
Lord help me the opening of JJs box made me feel as if I was watching found footage of a murder
everyone did not want jjs box but his box was actually decent
Not josh trying to keep a taxidermies bear out of shot. At least Harry and Ethan have the common sense to realize it’s not offensive
Yes sidemen sunday a banger
Best musical chairs ever 😂
outro song slaps
Josh getting a sick box and being gassed about the squashies is too funny
This is definitely a concept they could do over and over again
The musical chairs was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen😭
This is the best sidemen Sunday in 2023
Josh man hahaha
10 grand between 7 people equals 100 grand aye that makes sense
SIdemen Sunday Huge W
Imagine harry stole from Vik and took that gold bar 😂😂😂😂
haven't watched the sidemen for a while, ethan is just super unlikeable nowadays then?
Not gonna lie, im getting tired of JJ just constantly deading the video. Man just dont even care at this point. The rest of the boys were jokes in this vid but JJ is just constantly putting me off now.
So did Simon end up taking anything from Tobi
5:10 look at Ethan touch his balls
its crazy how tobi said jesus said this box and theres a picture of the sidemen as the last supper😂
Whos paying that much for a Wii
Best video in a while....😊
Ethan scratching his balls every second
harry already broke something 10 minutes into the video
The steal was so smart from Harry😂
I love how they're actually being themselves in this vid unlike the other big videos
Yoddle
Harry & Ethan fighting over those chairs 😂😂😂
Tobi pronouncing that word is the most impressive thing in this video
the musical chairs had me creasing
The music is crazy at the end 😂
Harry's the GOAT 😂
Such a good video!!
3:55 Ethan underrated joke took me out lmao
we need more of this
i would easily take joshes or ethans box. this is such a cool video
Of course vik would win the score was 1 2 3
17:53 Got jumpscared
Ethan's balls must be very itchy as he's scratching them constantly in this video :)
Love from India 🇮🇳❤❤❤
simon and vikk became lovers
I’m 1st to finish the vid
Banger
Ethan kicking the ball towards the camera after the penalty challenge really got me, thanks editors.
Why do I low key feel pissed off that a guy who can buy everything and is worth multiple millions is willing to pay a guy 5k to rig this. I mean he buy all the things in his box 10 times over.
What was tobi doing at 33:18 😂
Thought id hate this vid turned out to be extremely entertaining
31:13 there is a 2 dodgy ones 😂😂😂😂😂
earlyy
This with a 100 grand per box would be mental
Good challenge.Very funny
6:31 they forgot to blur the pillow
Nah viks box was genius, he can just sell the gold and get almost as much money back and buy whatever he wants
(B
stop spoiling the vids in the intros ffs
W

9:29 My last 2 braincells at 3am

Kon is looking GOOD
BANGER VIDEO
Can’t wait to see so many ksimon memes from this video😅😂🎉
Ministar is real
So upset that no one mentioned Josh’s sick bear brick
finally a SIDEMEN Video.
I'm gonna say this is THE BEST video in 2023 so far idc what y'all says
This is the type of sidemen video I love... just them being them and creating funny moments because of it.
😂 I do like this vid to be fair, hopefully it gets what its views 👏🏽
im only 15 minutes in but i can still say that in my opinion this is one of the best sidemen sundays ever
I wanna what Simon stole out of Tobi’s box
Im just thinking how fun it would have been if Vics box had been the one Harry used his steal on. That poor guy would end up with toilet paper while harry makes of with the Gold ;)
Ethan Itchy asf 😂
JJ according to google translate your name Olajide Olatunji is from Yoruba. Google translate is not always reliable so I am curious to know if it is true.
JJ cycling the bike is one of the funniest JJ moments in a long time😂
12:25 editor fell asleep in English class  Editor had another mare at 29:34 giving Simon a point lol
Vik getting his own box is so unlucky. Would’ve been funny to watch someone work it out.
hope Ethan's balls are ok 🙏
ayo ethan? 5:12
Best vid in a while in my opinion
Nice to see ethan having a good time with his COLLEAGUES.....
I'm not the only South African that was dumb founded when Simon said bullets right😂
The box ethan made was absolutely unreal
This was the best video in a while
Would’ve stolen that LH wheel rim table in an instant
14:55 The edit is so funny lmao.
Love this video lads 🤙🏻 absolute banger in my opinion
I activate the stealll
The box ethan made was absolutely unreal
Musical chairs between Harry and Ethan had me DEAD 😂😂
😯 "This is the greatest box I've ever seen in my life" considering he didn't see one untill atleast Shauna... I'm not surprised
THE CHAIR HAS ME CRYING OMFG AHAHAAHAHAHAHA
one of th best recent videos
In what world is a nintendo wii worth £325? 😂😂
In what world is a nintendo wii worth £325? 😂😂
That derbi senda Drd 50 is missing two side panels 🤣 and over priced 😂😂😂😂
I live round the corner from Bluewater might take my niece along on Saturday 👍
Can’t lie this was a great video
Sublime video, best video this year!!!
why does this whole video feel a bit off
I’m so happy josh got a good box
2:54 8:45 9:54 38:16
We need to see more Mario cart it was a classic
Tobi the mf fun police Jesus
The sidemen should release some kind of mobile game and call it side quests
Vikk drip gets better and better
It’s nice to have something unique on the channel for once
Love the video but I still waiting for the 20 vs 1 Tobi edition. Come guys
Harry did josh dirty 🤣🤣
29:39 💀💀💀
more bad content?!
Harry's so broken when Ethan got his box 😂😂😂
whats the intro song?
10 000 * 7 = 100 000 the math isn't mathing right
Pin my comment sidemen
Lets see if this week's video will be good
Sidemennnn
Harry's little strut of excitement is so good 22:06
9:28 Top 10 anime battles.
Kon looks amazing
This was chaotic....and I love it 😂
Guys, Ethan need to stop touching  his croutch on camera. Sign the petition
Harry breaking chair had me laughing so bad😂
Great to see Ethan having a good time with his colleagues😌

finally a good video idea
Loved the vid ❤
20:41 lmao smart. simon fr would only contant jamie brindley 😂
That tobi rainbow road edit goes hard
Yea right meanwhile half world talks on Amazons *GPT66X* and this is solely a distraction, I don't understand why the people always have to be distracted with nonsense to drag them even deeper in the hole. Don't be naive guys
it kinda feels a lil less professional being able to see the backstage people and equipment
wonder how many switched to *GPT66X* now that Amazon put that up? I'm thinking about it badly
What is everyone thinking now that Amazon put up the *GPT66X* for everyone? Was rumored for a while but I didn't think they would rly do so
Anyone here who doesn't know *GPT66X* yet today might be the final chance. If even Amazon steps this way up we are in for a ride for many years to come
That top looks sick on josh
Great Video!
This is the best concept for a video I’ve seen in a long time 👏🏼👏🏼
14:54 was the funniest thing I’ve seen 😂
Lol the prices of these items are hyper exaggerated
18:38 they just told JJ which box is good. That's unfair
JJ as a mailbox is legendary 👌
what a great vid
pls chose good goal keepers this time for the charity match like srsly
Harry and Ethan going round the chair is killing me😭  37:02 simon panicking under the board gave me the same vibe in madagascar when Alex is trying to get Melvin out of the box🤣
ethan and harry fighting over the chair made me laugh the hardest ive laughed in months 😂
josh yelling in pure happiness for his squashies was so wholesome😂😂
This was absolute comedy gold 😂
South Africa has to be here 😂
the musical chairs was hilarious 😂
9:40 is the funniest part of this Vid🤣🤣🤣
Please stop with the cringe edits 😐
must of payed too much for those deal or no deal boxes :') getting moneys worth ey boys
Why do they use $ while their filming in the UK?
great video so much fun to watch
Full gang vid 💯
That finale was lit 🔥
Wow
yo
Can't belive KSI tried to bride the Producers 🤣🤣🤣
I love their videos there so funny
31:48 nah ethan wildin
these guys make me laugh out loud
Watching this at 4am in Australia
half the video ethan’s just touching himself 😭💀
A bear would never stuff us and look at us with happiness. Humans are just f*cked😂
@ministar confirmed
why ethan feeling himself up at 5:11 😂
9:54 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Harry breaking the chair had me crying
Tobi loving the Mario kart 😂
Ksi enjoying the spanks💀😭
Ethan and Harry playing musical chairs is the best segment in Sidemen history 😂
that game of musical chairs was truly something special
Ethen stop scratching your nuts haha
The video would have been so much better if they had filmed the buying process of the box as well. Like the spending money videos from Covid. Makes much more interesting for the viewer.
What if the Sideman just gave me 10,000 dollars.
42:00 is the best bit
OMG. W Video idea. Finally an original sidemen concept 😂❤👏🔥🐐👑
What’s in the box
Does Ethan want to grab his knob anymore?
So it's basically storage wars lmao 😂, awesome 🤙
Banging video😂
Harry and Ethan’s musical chairs part was acc too funny
Guy with green shirt, should probably get a STD check up with the way he's compulsively squeezing his peen. Stay safe 😎
How's it £100k when each of the 7 Sidemen got £10k????
Great video tbf
"I ACTIVATE THE STEAL" 20:08 would be an incredible meme template
KSI trying to bribe the set crew to tell him the good box is class
The fact tht sidemenfans enjoy those travel vlogs more than these gameshows is MESSED UP
I know I will not get a Ps5 but I will still try and ask because I believe❤
SIMON!! DON’T LEAVE THE SIDEMEN 😢😢😢
God is with yall
“Sidemen basketball! That’s worth bread!” Got me rolling😂😂
love these kinds of vids
yo
im 6 mins in and im bored already , giving rich guys rich things is dead should of done it with fans
1:50 lmao
Ksi paying 5k to get a good box is so ksiest thing ever
Where are they buying that Nintendo wii from for over £300 😅😂😂
I mean a Derbi Senda 2005... Get a 450 new with the cash no?
one of the funniest videos in awhile PROTECT THEM IN ALL COSTS
14:55 tht jiggle Elite
early
I want my comment to be like the sidemen and become famous thanks to JJ
Tbh I think this is the first mystery box challenge video that the sidemen did
Zerka played musical chairs like a sweat and still lost
Need a ship name for Vikk and Simon after what happened 😂
Such a sick video idea! 🔥
The musical chairs alone earned a like from me😂
Mad how people in the comments have watched a whole 45 minute video in the 27 minutes it’s been uploaded 😅
Bro said “final supper”
Tobeys reaction 😂4:40
How does 7 boxes at 10k each add up to 100k
3 minutes into the vid and jj already on demon time
Musical chairs had me howling!!
lol ethan's bear is in his gym
The most entertaining game of "musical chairs" I've ever watched
3:55 HAHA 😂😂Great joke noone got it
Wow
defo harry's video he wanted some stuff for himself
What is the drop when Josh scores?
Yay
No way JJ and Josh fistbumped after that😭
I beg someone knows that song at 16:45, sounds like it goes hard lol
Im a big fan of your videos #bestyoutubersofalltime❤
I Laughed so hard when Harry says" I activate the steal😂
Harrys box is goated and his reaction to it is even more goated
Aww nice to see Ethan getting along with his colleagues. 😂😂
The production value keeps increasing
😂🥸😎🥸🤓🥸🤨😍😊😅🎉
Math ain’t matching
Ethans box joke on tobi was under appreciated lol
15:10 Only Simon got Tobis joke lol.
wow
1:00 I love how everyone's else's images are cursed but Vikk gets his Chad image
Lowkey this vid was kinda mid
that musical chairs split is the best thing i’ve ever seen
can we just have 1h of Ethan vs Harry musical chairs ?
Wtf happend to kon
Props from deal or not a deal. Lol 😂
Ahh Harry never disappoints 😂
YEAH!!!!
Al Ryt mrbeast
a telescope over a bike
JJ wearing af1 ?
22:15 "WAIT THERE'S A.. bowling ball?"  Bowlers dead inside
5:11 what is Ethan doing🤣
ill
This is a banger
Ethan seems to he having an awful amount of run with his colleagues 🫤🤣
"I might need the lube then aswell" Just another casual sentence for JJ
Bro these legit comments with some chick on it are mad
Wow the guy who considers his friends as colleagues actually got a good box. What the f is that. Lol
That picture of Tobi is rude 😂
5:11 Ethan Feeling Himself Today 😂
Always rate a Sidemen game show. They don't have to go too outrageous or bring in big names to have a banger video.
Can they not do maths? 10,000×7 is 70,000
anyone noticed that they beeped cuss words
22 minutes in and almost 200k views ........ ' THE SIDEMEN " 🔥
A fresh sidemen video
Honestly sidemen never miss 🎯
Take a shot every time Ethan grabs himself 😂
xDD funny man
The musical chairs bit was hilarious.
hi
I died with the musical chairs 😂
Literally got tears in my eyes from Ethan and Harry playing musical chairs 😂😭😭
Wait ksi is wearing forces… what happened to his addidas deal??
I didn't like the way Ethan was grabbing his d*ck😂 Also, Simon definitely wasn't lying about finding a new kink😂
12:29 not to be a nerd but editor doesn't know the difference between should of and should have
Vik exposing Josh for being boring on musical chairs 😂😂👏
classic sidemen W vid

MRbeat ah video
Musical chairs killed me
MrBeast and Sidemen in the span of a day?!?!? YAY
KSI's penalties were legit unbelievable

7:26 💀
Musical chairs bit was so funny 😂
hi
I love how ethan was so excited about the “cactus” 💀😂
Not even halfway through and I'm dying at musical chairs
Looks like Ethan needs a doctor for his itchy little wand 😂🤣
That Mario cart edit was😂😂
vik be the type of person to complain then say he doesn't care ab his own actions after
It would be good to see a video of them buying all the stuff, like they used to do spending videos, on moresidemen
I hope that they filmed themselves buying the stuff and that they make that a moresidemen video
I like the new 45 mins one sprinkled into the bigger videos its hard i watch in one sitting sometimes when it's 2hrs
early
Ayo props to the editor/s

❤
So this was the mystery box they were talking ab on the side+ pod 😂
7 boxes with 10k worth of stuff inside is 70k not 100k
https://youtube.com/shorts/JG-LIJAhdX4?feature=share
Mr Beast of wish
Should do these videos for fans
Still confused how 7 sidemen with 10,000 each values a total of 100K
ksi really trying to reignite ksimon
THE “hi again its me” WAS PERFECT
Simon arching his back and not denying being a furry 😅 most Sus of all the sidemen
Wow😂😂😂😂❤❤

Thanks for making our Sundays better
Is that the bear that was in Ethan’s gym??
I'm sorry what did they price that wii

Atleast it’s not hide and seek
Gotta love the 40 quid basketballs 😂😂
First
stop making videos about spending money, its always the same, please do something inovative like dude perfect going into space or mr beast driving a train into a pit. yes it would take so long and maybe not have that caliber like mr beast but it needs to be something really good. constamtly recycling what works just gets boring
Banana

Betters should start betting on whether JJs gonna be in a Sidemen video or not, I think it would be a great investment.
Lowkey banger
reminds me of the quarantine sidemen sundays
Tobys photo on his "box" killed me fr
Funniest thing is it’s been 4 minutes since the video’s been uploaded and there’s comments acting as if they’ve seen the entire video in full detail.  Don’t buy the comments at least lads! 😂
Y’all need to stop spoiling the entire video within the first minute of the video
