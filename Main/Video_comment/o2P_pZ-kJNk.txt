I wish more wrestlers who worked together genuinely disliked the other, it makes it 10 times more interesting.
Cm punk best men
CM Punk is back for at least the next couple years full time. BEST IN THE WORLD! 😊
Wrestlemania
He never needs a title. And I mean that with no disrespect.
Think is awesome.. i hope no one gets injured and ruins this match at wrestlemania
Seth Rollins  Was Right  .
Seth Rollins don’t like nobody 😂
Havent seen this Rollins since 2k15 shessh
And yes everythings been handed to cm
Literally how is cm not on suicide watch.
Still talking....... Ffs guy
Cm punk wwe awesome great good going wwe
Thank God for this Thank you 🏆🐐🎯🙏❤️
Why you Mad Seth. Why he mad.
Go it find it. He’s waiting. Why he’s choke himself
Go it find it. He’s waiting. Why he’s choke himself
Why you Mad Seth
I’d love his first match (I haven’t watched in months ) his first match back at mania
That entrance really feels like the super villain coming in to address the new upstart
The GOAT!!
Cody vs punk final 2 double elimination...
He isn’t gonna win if he fights Rollins anyway, we all know Seth. 🙄
🤔 just like Seth abandoned the shield Lol
AEW Punk: if anyone is disappointed that I walked out I understand but I want you to understand I was never going to get better in the place that got me sick in the first.  WWE Punk: if anyone is disappointed I understand and hey I'm sorry.  😔
Imagine cm winning the royal rumble and then seth show up at the ring and say, "see you at wrestlemania!!"
Seth slapped this dude on this promo.
I don’t think so
I stopped watching when punk left hope he’s back for awhile love him
This scene was cut majorly, punk also said that’s the only time I will stand here and let you disrespect me to my face and not come after.
Maybe Punk wins the Royal Rumble match and chooses to face Rollins at WrestleMania 40.
Welcome to Rollins IS JERICHO!!!!!
They’ve done such a great job of building the card and setting up the stories for wrestlemania 40.
its kinda sad that seth hates cm punk in real life i wish they would bury the hatchet feels very personal
Cmp  your boring
No producer for the Seth and Punk promo, oh my god this match is going to be sick.
Seth Rollin: “I’d Win” 😂
CM Punk forgot to mention before he left he got his revenge with Randy Orton. That sweet revenge that he’s been holding onto for years and finally cashed in with the nexus after showing the video of Orton punting his head on the Jumbotron.
he is kinda starting to promo like austin if you see when he paces
He is going to be One of The Best Of All Time, one of these days.  This guy can cut some fantastic, riveting promos.
Let’s go Rollins !!! No love for quitters on this side !!
Would have be better if Seth Rollins not done the stupid walk to the ring.
Seth actually confronted him...punk is a bitchy cry baby while will ruin the wwe locker room just like Rohan and awe
Rollins is better champ by a lot over reigns just by not being a part time worker and showing up every week
Punk actuality preferred AEW this is just a last resort
Too late, the product is even more watered down. The audience ratings agree as well. Ratings barely get over a million, and the zoomers don't even know who he is.
This match is going to get so personal and I’m so ready
This video has officially reached Collision's average rating which means AEW lost his golden goose. Great one Triple h!
I still want to see cm punk vs Roman reigns
I know what I want in WWE I want the shield back in WWE, running it shield versus judgment day Imperium, DIY, new Day, alpha academy, and many more
Dean Ambrose you need to come back to WWE right now the shield reunion, please😀🤞🏻
How come they all have the same haircut 😂
Road To WrestleMania Begins At The Royal Rumble
I know this is scripted, but you can tell that there’s some truth in what Seth is saying. Can tell it in his eyes. He can’t stand Punk in real life.
its always someone else's fault with him the poor fella
I would be genuinely shocked if they put Punk over in their initial WM match
Don't worry Seth i can't stand cm punk Either i can't stand a a wrestler trying everything in his power to tear the wwe apart i hate hate hate cm punk
I always thought 10000000% he was gonna come back someday for sure....But now that he has it really is so surreal
Its all about CM doing whats in his best interest.
This feud is going to carry WWE through 2024 and I’m here for it
This is non scripted btw if anyone was wondering. This feud is personal. I’m here for it!
Punk vs AJ Styles dream match
Bring back the fire burns and I'll finally be on board with cm punk coming back
He looks so old anymore. Like he has gained age in a short time of period.
I just pray that priest doesn’t ruin this
This is 💰, boxoffice type 💰
Seth Rollins Vengeance From The Past
Skipped the highlight of him telling Rollins that's his only pass to speak to him disrespectfully without coming after him 😮
Should of wore your hair down...not in the Romans Raines bun....
I give him a year before he rage quits like AEW
Is this the redemption arc?
They chose Seth because, of how he worked with Cody.   I'm not a Tyler Black/Seth Rollins guy.... but, i have faith.
It is true. Punk actively tried to put WWE out of business. Like idk ..   last year. I wouldn't have hired him back. He's not good enough. Never was. What has he really done? Nothing
CM Punk winning a tertiary title is ok...
Cm punk looks like he is sick. Are they going to do this every week? Listen to him whine for 20-30 mins on the mic.
Why do people like this guy? I want to like wrestling but these people aren’t even stars, he’s just like Roman Reigns, a fail but they keep pushing these guys and trying to sell them to us
Cmpunk gonna just come back and get a title shot.....just walk away again dude. You know your gonna
What a SUPER GREAT segment!!!
“Are you done” punk all the way
Dude I gotta say it again holy shitnthis is probably one of my favorite Rollins scenes of all time🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
ROLLINS IS RAW!
This is sick two baby face and when Rollins said this is my home.I will do everything to protect it from people like you.🤯🔥💯
Yawn
I like that they really don't like each other, makes the promos more meaningful
He would have to wrestle Brock Lesnar so why isn't Paul Heyman being incorporated in this? I'm just a casual watcher so nothing I say means anything anymore than any other fan of the performance fights
This gonna be greatest match ever
We got one main event set with this one
He’s cooked as a wrestler but still fun to see him back
I love how they put everything aside and are actually standing on business. Thank you gentlemen this was good
CM Punk and Samoa Joe are the best on the mic 🎤 today.
Unlike Seth Rollins that CM Punk has been a Champion for longer than 200 days that Seth Rollins has right now. Because Seth Rollins will not surpass 434 days. CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk!!!! BEST IN THE WORLD!!!!
I like the fact that it is not good guy vs bad guy, I mean the Cody Nakamura feud is a really good babyface/heel storyline  But this is so interesting because I really don't know who I am rooting for, but they both just say what they want and amplify their character and I go back and forth depending on what they say.
Seth Rollins is the best wrestler in the world hands down
Feud of the year and the year hasnt even started yet
This is going to be a really good rivalry.
CM punk better than Randy
They better not spoon feed Punk. He's no where as talented n hard working as Seth Freakin Rollin.
So funny when people say Seth fued is going to be good. He copies Hangmans program now and has copied the joker character for years.
Rollins is trash . Not a punk fan either but anyone against Rollins has my vote .
Cm punk should be a heel
Predictions... Buckle Bomb Cm Punk career over 😅
Serious question, why does Rollins hair due look like my garbage bag after I tie it off?
I’d rather watch cm punk face Roman reigns tbh but I know wwe would never let cm punk win that match
Cody literally did the same thing that Seth said punk did
It’s wild Roman has been stripped
Boy Cm Punk dont care about what Rollins think
HHH just said yeah ok Punk here's your time, go speak from the heart and Seth here's your time, go vent. Everyone cool? K go make me money.
WWE hasn’t had an epic blood feud since hitman & stone cold in the 90’s . Hopefully cm punk & Seth Rollins comes somewhat close to that at least.
“With every fiber of my being, I hate you” LMAO 🤣
CM PUNK was at NXT
Best Seth Rollins promo in history of WWE he tells the truth
Seth doesn't really like CM Punk in real life, so some of this is real from Seth.
They skipped the best lines
This dude cm punk is a fake way superstar ifykyk
Once a punk always a punk ..CM Punk is a Clown... Sell out
Who is cm punk?
Did he just say he never asked for anything or anything handed to him bs that was your  biggest gripe he never main evented mania and he was injured
Shut up and take all of our money
Seth don't worry about Punk!!
I’m actually rooting for punk this time
Cm punk ecw champion, aew champion twice , tag team champion, intercontinental champion, 3 times world heavyweight champion, 2 wwe champion ROH champion. Guy its a legend 😎  ( had the balls to be at ufc even if he lost) most of you wont do it and die in the ring 🤤
This segment was awesome
I back Seth 1000000000000%
Good feud but punk is rusty/washed up in the ring I rather see this 10 years ago 😴 oh well better late then never ig 😅
Seth is a "snowflake" He would've never lasted in the territory days, whiny little B---
Feud going to be crazy, Rollins turning heel
Punk shouldve signed with smackdown and traded to raw for Cody Rhodes. Cody would be able to challenge Roman reigns and then get Punk to win the Rumble and challenge Seth at WM
Cody vs. Roman, Punk vs. Rollins, Jimmy vs. Jey, Orton vs. Solo, Knight vs. Paul, Gunther vs. Lesnar (Hopefully)…. The possibilities for WM 40 are fantastic! Let me get my tix now…
the fact that when cody came back it was with seth and now punk with seth! seth is the goat right now
Colby Lopez (Seth Rollins) and Phil brooks (cm punk) actually hating each other is gonna make this so good.
Sounds like Adam page 😂
Seth said hangman’s line
This is the new Bret Hart versus Shawn Michaels But strangely I think CM punk is going to be the Shawn Michaels... And Seth Rollins is going to The Bret Hart..
bunch of marks
You gotta acknowledge Seth Franklin Rollins of his Passion that Fire and Desire on the mic cause he speaks the truth and spitting out facts 8:28
Can't wait to see Punk take out Rollins!
Seth Franklin Rollins will PROTECT THIS HOUSE
Punk seems genuinely happy
Punk rewriting his personal history is hilarious, lol.
John Cena and rock vibes but still good
No big fan of Seth but at least he stands up an say the truth, their are sooo many better wrestlers than CM Skunk an he is one I luv it when he let him know that he would wrestle rings around 😂so true.
If Seth think cm punk scared of him Seth go ask hunter how was the cm punk era ask him how hard it was 😂😂
If LA Knight doesn't win the RR, WWE will be in shambles.
Team Rollins ALL THE WAY
Can never lose when story and reality are blurred. I’m all in for this rivalry that could be one of the best ever😳
That’s a nice purple suit
If my memory  server me  correctly. Rollins was with the shield and help Punk  keep his belt. I  just want to keep the record stright.  That is the last time I seen them togather
If they let punk win the rumble I will quit watching wwe and focus solely on aew punk is a looser always has been always will be
I'm here 😊
Really don’t care for CM Punk he is bad for business
this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Seth FREAKIN Rollins keeping it 💯 this is awesome!!!
I know cm punk will end up being the more cheered babyface but im a huge rollins fan and definitely dont think punk should be the 1 dethroning him
Rollins 100x punk 😂😂😂
Awesome hes back and most likely gonna take the title from rollins or atleast try but meanwhile Cody Rhodes gets pushed to the side and probably wont get his title shot anytime soon.
Roman is gonna lose .. so is Seth FRIGGN Rollins.... and then Ambrose is gonna be back too... .. forget this all .. this is an introduction to get the guys back ... dislike if you want ... matter of time.. just wait
Things are getting raw on Raw!
CM Punk you sly dog. He is basically doing the Adam Page thing where he went into business for himself and said that "I have to defend AEW from CM Punk" promo. The difference here is that no one is going into business for themselves lol
I'm with Seth Rollins
Hopefully he doesn’t break his foot trying to kick someone like he did in AEW.
is that the guy from monster house
WWE stages are absolute garbage these days. No creativity all lazy LED screens.
I acknowledge Rollins for his great masterpiece of Promos
He didn't break kayfabe he just spoke as Colby Lopez
The way Seth Franklin Rollins cut a excellent tremendously terrific promo on CM Punk it was incredible but the most electrifying part was when Rollins said protect this place from guys like you is a stoke of genius and simply a splendid choice words too he was spitting out the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and facts as well
This will be the feud of this year ! Of course counting royal rumble & mania !!
"...I hate you..."  That felt so real
If wwe took hogan back, brought Eric bishoff in, brought back lesnar, he’ll brought back Bret hart and HBK…. They will bring back just about anyone.
Hella smarks in this comments section
They should bring back the lightweight championship or cruiserweight title for cm punk to compete for no way homie should be world champion Again .
Seth is real tough on punk but completely silent on Romans BS
This soap opera just gets sillier by the years😂.
Seth Freakin’ Rollins needs to be protected at all Costs!!! 🤩
I can't wait til Punk turns heel
Seth is Sean….Cm Punk is Brett. Let’s do it right this time boys n hopefully only the fans see “sunny days”😅
I was sad when cm punk left, but I always held hope that he would come back. But after a while I accepted he probably wasn't. Glad he did come back. But im conflicted because I don't know who to cheer for. Cm punk had a right to do what he did and seth had right to say what he said.
Is Punk gonna cry about Rollins like he cried about Hangman when he cut pretty much the same promo?
I love Seth he isn’t int wrong even if I like cm punk Seth is right!!!!
This is the exact promo he had with Hangman Adam page
I think cm punk likes my 2 chogoink franky toys  a lot  and my red Tokyo tower franky as well
there was no way both randy and him would be on the same show so now that they got their ratings..
Ugh Rollins is insufferable.
Ok that part.  Yes. I was so mad I stop which for a wild. 😢. I'm still mad . Sometimes us as fan really got to no how to separate facts from fiction. I had to tell myself it's just t.v he'll be back. ❤. But boy o Boy just like John Cena.  You just get tired of holding your breath. ❤
I always said cm punk was Seth before seth
MUST SEE TV!!!!!!!!
Best thing that happen in WWE lately.
I love CM Punk just had his arms crossed and let Seth strike first with his words because when their inevitable showdown happens, Punk is gonna strike harder at Seth with his words. Like just imagine if Punk told Seth “you were part of the shield but you’re in the ring with the guy who created it and picked you to be a member because he saw your potential so you’re welcome.” It would be amazing.
Send CM back to NJP.. dudes irrelevant.
Wwe cooking something good I love it
CM Punk hasn't done a thing, but the crowd is treating him like he's Michael Jackson. John Cena didn't even get this much. That's star quality.
They cut out cm punk line lmao
So seth is turning heel basically since Cm punk is back and he might drop the belt to him or might not 😮 7:37
CM PUNK 🤜😍❤
Never thought anybody could make me like Seth Rollins.
Yeah its going be good
Punk Cody and Seth need to start cutting down there talking time it’s getting too long
I already feel like Jey isn't going to become champion after watching this. I do find it funny how without saying a word punk is already in the head of Seth Rollins
Cm punk looks like middle aged red neck podcaster. 😅
Seth rollins gots a point
I’ll tell you right now, Punk isn’t winning the Rumble. Cody is and he’s going to knock off Roman (FINALLY). But Seth and Punk will duke it out at Wrestlemania. He doesn’t need to win the Rumble for that to happen. ITS GONNA HAPPEN.
🧀
Wrestling is getting great again
CM punk needs to get humble and lose a few matches.
Wwe can break the contract nothing is exclusive you can get traded/release at any time 😮😂😂😂
I’m ready for him to leave again.😂
WWE fans y'all are funny just saying..
Super duper glad I missed Punks entrance.
Didn't expect Seth too early but this was awesome
Seth Freakin’🔥Rollins SpotLight✨ Just Got “DIMMED⚠️”💯 by CM Punk❕👊🏼
Not getting the absolute SALSA buffalo sauce on the mic we used to get from Punk. Rollins got a lot of jabs in, and Punk just took it. What’s going on?
thats what exactly what he is a punk!!! Seth is my guy!!!
I still can’t believe he’s bck 😂😂
Am i the only one that noticed that glitch at 6:05 ???? I heard they were going to continue the Bray stuff!
Lookin like a member of Prince's revolution bun head mu fu.👎
Seth is right.
Seth : I hate you  That took me out 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That “I hate you” line cracked me up cuz he changed his energy so smooth.
Cm punk back is boring. He was better many years ago when he was actually fighting against the wwe and Vince McMahon
Who else is believing cm punk .this guy is a fraud.i used to like him as a wrestler but this guy lame
Everytime Seth gets pushed to his limits he proves over and over he's the very best overall performer there is in the industry...  Not named Rhea Ripley
The fact that Hunter got these two in the ring this quick is awesome.
Cmpunk Seth Rollins championship
The best stories are those based on truth.     Love this
I hate CM PUnk ....but   this IS GOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Imagine being in CM Punk’s brain and realizing you’re straightedge and still have to go through a whole redemption arc like Jeff Hardy.
MJF did it better
god please give me cm punk vs an styles
CM punk back. I  need too start watching wrestling again. I haven't watch wrestling since 2015
This was brilliant!
Rollins will suffer a gts
Seth not wrong .
CM Punk fathered most of this roster these next feuds are gonna be hot
Honestly I'll like to see there match but cm punk better not win there are so many superstars that have been working so hard that deserve a title reign for him to just walts in and be handed a title he does not deserve to take the title off Rollins
Wow rollins sounds like hangman. I thought this was aew for a second
5:56
i don't buy the I hate you though....Rollins looked like he regretted using that word.
Promos will now start begin to get good for once
You just know Triple H was thinking "alright Tony, let me show you how an adult company deals with real life drama that can be turned into a hot angle and generate interest".
It’s funny once Seth gets to the  Im protecting wwe from you   CM Punk had a flash back of that hangman Adam page promo!!!!   I’m protecting Aew from you!!!   😂😂😂
Don’t worry they let other super stars go to pay cm punk salary and cm punk be gone in two years if that
Punk Vs Rollins is gonna be good
Punk wins rumble, beats Rollins at wrestle mania Seth retires/ leaves for aew in July when his contract is up.
PromoJoe going to have a field day with this.
Kinda rocking with Seth with this 1
Whats the point being exclusive to raw if we're gonna see him make appearances on smackdown and maybe nxt.
Ugh boring raw always taking every talent as usual and now this boring Rollins? 🥱
Let me know when the ruthless aggression era comes back
They have made Seth Rollins into such an idiot. Is he a music composer or a wrestler now
Grandpa punk
Seth:”I never had anything handed to me” Triple H help you win your first WWE title
Im getting hella deja vu rn. A mix of the Seth and Riddle rivalry with a mix of the Adam Page promo
Dude you got fired from wwe and aew , your a crybaby
CM Punk will not beat Seth Rollins fair and square but hey it’s WWE
Perfect promo!
I mean everything seth was saying was what we all were saying and i stand by him 💯
Rollins doing the Adam Page bit to Punk has to be a big LOL for those guys backstage. That was Rollins trying to make him crack up and Punk knew he couldn’t. Anyone who thinks these two have legit heat are delusional. Seth has planted this seed for the past year outside of the ring. This is going to be awesome.
Seth vs rollins then winner face roman !!!
There was so much tension in the ring, I wonder if it’s going to get personal between the two in the months to come
9:25  😳🍿
The Hangman promo hits different now. And Page did it with so much more conviction.
CM PUNKKKKKKKK
That BLATANT shot at HangMam Adam Trash 😂 “pRoTeCt iT fRoM yOu” 🥴
CM PUNK 1
WrestleMania.. Cody Rhodes vs Roman Reigns and Seth freaking Rollins vs CM Punk
Seth rollins is right .
Cm punk is Awful .
eh, Randy vs Roman is better. Seth will win. Punk is in his Ego.
I agree with seth
It'd be fun if they just had him float between both brands instead of choosing 1
Seth has a good honest point
This is the nest thing wwe had done bring back CM Punk I remember what CM Punk talking about the match of CM Punk and sath is going to be amazing match
If I recall correctly the last person who said a promo like this lost a belt...but Seth did it better
No one wants to admit it, I will.. Punks promos have been boring af and hard to pay attention to. His in ring skills have diminished greatly... now the only true skill he has left, is being watered down and bombing lol. But everyone is going to pretend like its awesome and sit by while punk makes himself double champ and steals away codys big win.
So Punk is gonna be a heel
CM PUnk feels so disingenuous and desperate.  He is saying most of the same t hings he said in AEW, none of which he lived up to. It's just empty promises.
Brock watching this like somebody say royal rumble
He's never gonna say that they fired him on his marriage day.... Before he stops wrestling...Trust me...😂😂😂😂
Hangman Page & Tony KHAN should take notes 📝
Rollins did a better version of the hangman promo.
"confronts Seth Rollins"  No, other way around lol
We knew this was coming. He was never gonna be on Smackdown lol
I can’t stand this pg punk he’s missing a thing or 2
In real life,he doesn’t like cm punk
Now that's good wrastlin
Seth Rollins is trash
Never been a fan of punk
Well you know he isn't beating Roman but yeah he can have that belt
Guess Seth gonna be heel of this rival
Seth rollins basically copied hangman adam page
Colby Lopez and Phil Brooks real animosity and hate
I doubt he talked about Seth at all in the past ten years.
Seth mad that cm punk gets massive pops
Seth you are fake and punk isn't. That is why Seth will never be over like punk.
That was a very tense promo right there.  The most tense is when Seth did that anger look at CM Punk.  It's real and personal mix with the promo to keep it with the business.  But it still some real heat that's why it is so tense and real.
WWE Fans: The Bloodline story is the best!!!!!!! CM Punk: Hold my drink and watch this......
Cm punk winning royal rumble after this segment for sure. They gonna kill each other on the mike after he win.
So this is a real version of Adam page vs cm punk I love this lol 😂
For those who don't know, RR should have been stripped of the title about 2 years ago, and multiple times since. CM Punk explains at the 2:00 mark that the WWE used to make their champions compete, or they would lose the title.
CM Punk is washed and broke useless
I wanted him back on Smackdown but this is still good. Looking forward to this clash. 😄😄😄
Not mad but would’ve been sick if the contract details that made it “the best offer” was to have a guaranteed championship match against Rollins. But regardless, the Cody Vs Punk match as final 2 in the rumble will be insane.
This is why punk came back..this is why Seth is the world champ..I can't explain how good this was..I literally can't lol but under HHH and how he book these shows it's how pro wrestling suppose to look like..I'm having flashbacks of the attitude era with all the great stars mixed with new up and comers and funny skits with great booking wow
His first match back is at the royal rumble and before that TLC that year before he left he faced the shield in a 3 on 1 handicap match and CM punk won its literally picking up where punk left off well done WWE this is going to be a great feud A CM PUNK N A NEW ROLLINS with both fighting styles similar but yet so different🔥
The Feud of 2024…  Coming Soon…
Is there a reason Punk hasn’t had a match or even a scrap yet? Orton came back swinging but Punk has only cut promos.
Seth has been unlocked! We need the villain back!
🥲 I love WWE
Seth u sounded a lil bit like hangman there.
Great promo, I hope these two realize they can do something special here with this rivalry...this could be historic, don't waste this oppurtunity
I know that this is scripted but I know there is truth behind Seth’s words and I’m 100% behind him. Cm punk, as much as fans want to deny it is a p.o.s. who is unprofessional when he doesn’t get what he wants. This is truly his last chance but for me, it’s going to take a lot from him to change how I feel about him right now.
Watch cm punk not win the royal rumble, and watch him throw a big fit about it and leave 🤣
Nobody gonna say Rollins gave same promo that the Hangman gave?
😴😴😴
I know I've seen this before but where 😂
now what if randy and cm punk both take titles
Anyone could see this coming from a mile away...there is no way they would have Orton and Punk on the sane show after they made their big returns...you know Punk wasn't going to NXT LMBO..and they want to match Punk up against Rollins for some reason lol
CM Punk isn't athletic as Rollins.  Hopefully he doesn't botch his move like we seen in AEW
I know it’s Kayfabe, but look how big of a draw CM Punks still is. It’s crazy!
This is money! Just straight up money!
And I am out. He is a hypocrite going to main-event night 1 of the 4-night extravaganza like he said he never would. So much for the Main event of last night or nothing huh
5:59
They cut some of Seth’s promo. Af one point I could here the Jon Moxley coming out of him
the double turn at wrestlemania is gonna be so fire
these mfs gonna COOK
HE'S A QUITTER!!! CM PUNK WILL QUITAGAIN IF HE DOESN'T GET HIS WAY!!!
I knew from survivor series that this was going to be the angle they went this... Raw is about to get good again
It was a no brainer that CM Punk was going to raw when Randy went to smackdown...
Thing is Seth is telling facts, while CM Punk need to prove he isn't the snake that he was in the past.
Can’t wait for that wrestlemania match. Punk vs Rollins night 1
interesting...kind of a repeat of the punk/page promo...
Did we just witness the seeds to could possibly be one of the greatest, maybe even what can be the greatest rivalry of all time.
Seth hit it OUTTA the stratosphere! There wasn't much Punk could (nor should) have said after that. Respect!
I'm sorry but in my book CM Punk does NOT deserve to be automatically forgiven for the things he did and said when he left WWE ten years ago. There is an old saying "For Every Action There Is An Equal And Opposite Reaction" and "Actions Have Consequences". If Punk thinks that he can simply come back and give that phony apology that he gave on raw last night then he is sadly mistaken. I do not trust CM Punk right now until he proves he can be trusted.
You know, Punk winning the Rumble just to build this feud might not be a bad thing. There are other ways to get Cody to Roman.
Seth heel turn coming
Well they made it obvious, CM wins the Royal Rumble and goes on to main event night 1 of Wrestlemania vs Seth
I think seth Rollins, is right what he said about cm punk
I want a retirement match so seth could send punk to retirement land.😂😂
I hope it's real glass
What I like is that is NOT an angle, Seth truly dislikes this guy so I’m glad to have it come to a head!!!  Hopefully Seth can stay focused and not let his TRUE emotions get the best of him
welp, we know who the rumble winner is.
Good promo…. Wwe is taking their time with these guys to build anticipation for this match. If this was AEW, Tony khan would have rushed this and have them wrestle on free tv next week.
Sooo good
Jungle girl vs Rusev will be the feud of 2024😅😅
Lol. That's funny. I guess Rollins is a cm punk fan after all. I mean, pretty close Adam Page promo. Hmmm, rip off huh. Lol.
Wwe need to go back to cinematic
I smell a good story line between these 2 intertwined with Jey Uso, Randy Orton and Cody Rhodes.  I feel Sami would enter the Rumble at #30 because he's been MIA for a while.   AJ Lee will be #30 at the Rumble in the women's match
Not a fan of CM.
Soon as Seth’s music hit, my face went 😳
Hey WWE, CM punk is not the answer.
Powerful promo from both this is what the fans want and need thank you HHH
Legendary
WWE needs to hire jack Perry and say thank you for the actions you did to bring cm punk back to the WWE
I got a WCW reference…Wrestling is back 💯
I love the Cleveland arena
Punk seems to be more relaxed now that he’s back in WWE.
The big thing is that Seth was 100% right about Punk. If he goes over Rollins, i will not be happy
This is going to be rock and stone cold epic
Say what you want, WWE knows how to build a story.
This might feed families
I’m glad when I started watching wrestling again for the first time since 2011 that I did not get too invested, because I can stop watching it again.
Who are these two?
Auuuuuuggghhhhh Seth delivered this with the utmost passion I’ve seen in a while. He’s been wanting to say that for the longest time. Even punk was speechless
This looks good
Whenever the fight happens , it’s going to be RECEIPTS AFTER RECEIPTS ……AFTER RECEIPTS
Meh
I really hope punks second stint is exactly how hogan's last wwe official in ring career went. It felt like hogan wanted to give back a little and to right the wrongs he made with some of the guys backstage doesn't mean he wanted to be friends but to let by gones be by gone. We haven't seen the next nature boy , the rock, stone cold.. but we for sure have seen the new hogan and that's cm punk no matter were he goes love him or hate him people talk about him daily
I was there last night. Place was intense!
When Seth said "I hate you" it didn't feel like kayfabe. He's a professional. He'll job for Punk if that's what Vince wants.
Even though he stole a lil bit of his lines from Hangman Seth was in HIS BAG🔥🔥🔥
Cm punk is so garbage
Punk is blown away looking at the hardcam side 😂
seth is mas the spotlight is being taken off of him
Cm punk vs seth Rollins WrestleMania ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hope they don’t book him in any matches leading up to WM bc he will just get hurt as he always does nowadays 🤦‍♂️
Rollins came off like a bully
That old school feels coming back
Either way whoever wins priest cashes In not guessing if priest wins or not but it leads to Seth and punk teaming against judgement day together
Wtf
I see their match at wrestlemania with MJF making his debut
9:27 I feel the exact same way as Seth Rollins dose about him as well.
07:45 the looks CM Punk gave lol Kween
This should end up being punks best match. I hope could keep up with rollins
This guys ego is bigger than his talent
This is the first confrontation between Seth “Freakin”Rollins and C.M. Punk! C.M. Punk is going to have to participate in the next year’s Royal Rumble event at the Royal Rumble! Seth “Freakin” Rollins and C.M. Punk have a wonderful confrontation and they will have to compete for Seth “Freakin” Rollins’s world heavyweight championship in a world heavyweight championship match at WrestleMania 40!
Who is watching AEW?  Uh no one. Boring!!!!
Dude this wrestlemania is gonna hit like CRACK! 40 year anniversary , tko’s first mania . The entrances are gonna be insane and the matches are gonna be just as good
Wow! This isn't wrestling it's comedy hour with clowns
I was screaaamingggg 😮‍💨 I love all of this. Every single spec of it. So many possibilities.. Raw was the only choice for him. 🙌🏻🥲
This mf talks so much. He still has YET to actually wrestle😭😭
Truth is - go back to AEW CM Punk, you already had your time to shine in WWE
CM Punk was Rollins teacher back on the first season of NXT when Rollins made his WWE debut. It's all come full circle
Punk is just incredible
He mentioned my biggest weakness, Mickie James,  mmmmmmm sexiest woman alive.
Ok. I need someone to remind me why they have real heat with each other. I kinda stoped watching after Roman won for the 1,000th time.
I never seen a guy bring the company so much money and he hasn't even wrestled yet.
I DO NOT LIKE CM PUNK.
"With every fiber in my being, I hate you." 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Would be a better match with anyone else. Punk is all mic no skills. Really go watch his aew matches go watch them and you will see what im talking about. He faced top tallents and the win was impressive that he didn't pass out or hurt anyoor himself
We are seeing The Rock vs John Cena of this generation
Monday Night Rollins  🏆 🎥 🎞
They both 5'9" Rollins just wears lifts😅
People just don't understand how good CM punk really is. He was the face of WWE before Seth and Roman Reigns.
Rollins was outstanding here
Can't wait for this legendary feud
Punk wins the rumble but Seth will go over at Mania
Interesting
CM Punk couldn’t do it at AFE so he comes to WWE thinking he got what a joke
When Punk brings up Rollins meltdown on twitter when folks were calling him out is going to be hilarious!
CM Punk makes it cool to be a 'punk' He makes being a'punk' so cool
Absolutely under any and all circumstances Seth should not drop the title to punk. If any one should it should be roman cause he's trash.
rollins vs punk wm40 confirmed.
Seth Rollins speaking Facts CM Punk is trash
This is gonna actually elevate that belt, and Raw.   It's been a couple decades, but WWE is finally getting good again.
i think rollins was seriously mad but is starting to get over it and realize punk changed and is now ready to feud with him
This is what AEW should’ve did with CM Punk and The Elite
I don't see how they give the Royal Rumble to anyone other than Randy orton. If they somehow let CM Punk win the rumble that's going to be a shame
Seth did a better version on Adam Page’s promo against Punk.
This. This is what I wanted from CM Punk's return.
I was watching this last night at the NY Giants game😊2024 WWE is gonna be lit🔥💪🏾
THAT MEANS CODY WILL FINISH THE STORY!
Seth referenced things from that Adam Page/Punk promo
So we’re just doing away with Cody’s story?
These promos are boring af. 😒
His song doesn't even have O in it?
Hope he doesn’t drop the title to him…
Punk became a lil punk when seth was telling the truth!
Hope punk takes that title
Let the cinema begin
Punk has me watching WWE again just like in 2011
seth making this look personal is what will make their feud more interesting
Vince says make it a mixed tag  with the two spouses
You know, cm punk doesn't die his hair, doesn't even come out to punk rock. His real name is Phillip.
The only thing good about cm flunk is his entrance music.
Punks talking to this crowd like an AEW crowd not realizing these WWE fans are brain dead and don't know what he's talking about
WWE crowds are so clueless and boring
Looked like Seth confronted him....but ok
C M Hypocrite 🧿
god I love this so much
Anyone get Hangman vibes from Seth trying to protect his house being AEW or WWE respectfully from Punk. Good stuff but seemed a bit the same that I've heard with Hangman promo
They may turn Seth heel but he's actually right ▶️👍🏿 about everything he's saying 😂.
Seth rollins has the best drip. Dripping swag
Punk better not win any titles till after 2 manias go by ok maybe a tv or intercontinental at most
Wrestling is back 🔥
Oh this gonna be gooood
Both could turn heel in an instant, hopefully its Punk him being a heel is where he shines best.
I like how people say copy n paste from aew but at least nobody here fyi went into business for themselves 😂😂 so thank you once again hangman and jungle boy for bringing punk back
Punk let him off...he could have verbally destroyed seth but kept it simple and it was great
Cena/Rock tension 😬
Starbucks’ take on Grimace is highly upset.
fak cm skunk
As soon as that music hit I was like....and SO IT BEGINS....🔥 🍿
Can't wait for this feud. They may get match of the year when fighting at Royal Rumble.
"F" Seth Rollins never cared bout his sqeaky voice! It's clobbered time!!!
Rollins promo sounded a lot like Hangman's "workers rights" promo to me.
I remember when edge told John cena I hate you 😅
Wwe is showing Aew how it’s done!! Nothing but absolute professional’s and even tho they don’t like each other personally they are able to let it go and do business for the better of the company… Aew has put on some great shows and have had some awesome moments but they’ve got a long way to go!!
There's so many good wrestlers they could let beat Seth Rollins for that title wrestlers that have been there and tried to make WWE great and if they let CM Punk come back in after leaving and going to another brand over those wrestlers and get that title that would be a shame
Glad CM Punk is back!!!!
FEUD OF THE YEAR 2024!!!!!!!
Make sense since Randy in smakdown and I believe Cody will too soon.
Chick magnet punk is closing in on 50 years old wow..
And a great promo in my eyes is someone who questions if they what is said is real, and if they have a script…
HBK VS Bret Hart
I can’t wait till Punk turns heel.. He could turn here, but it would be too soon for this to happen. I don’t think Seth should be the bad guy in this. They shouldn’t even touch each other until mania (cause I believe they can create genius by their words alone)
your all going to be disappointed.
For Once, Seth Rollins isn’t acting like a “Happy to be here” Lame-o. Good promo. But CM Punk is gonna take u to school
Wade Barrett excited cause the Nexus is almost full
Best promo I have ever seen from Rollins. Most of them are goofy. Punk is making him step up his game.
This is awesomely fascinating! ❤❤❤
Said it before, say it again.   Seth is going to embarrass him
I was very disappointed in him leaving he been my favorite since saw him in ecw so glad he back
This is sooo fukcing good!
Glad seth quit acting like a goof long enough to get serious and have a real promo. He'll never be the top guy if hes  doing the jokester routine.  Plus that music needs to go. Tired of the sing along bs.
Funny to hear Seth "Burn it down" Rollins use tear it down as an insult. LOL
Seth has a point, but CM Punk is taking that title at Mania
Can't take  the angry crossdresser and his annoyingass fans serious
The crowd was so split that’s a GOOD PROMO
Seth and his whiny voice. He should take vocal lessons from triple h.
no one loves cm punk more than cm punk
Rollins and Punk need to cook. I’d rather see them go at it at Wrestlemania. If both Punk and Orton go at Roman it’s gotta be a triple threat match
Something tells me this feud is going to do WAYYYYY more good for Seth than it ever will Punk.
🔥🔥💯
Wasnt this same promo done like 2 years ago in Aew with Adam Page?
Got Hangman Adam Page vibes
Seth you were build for the WWE, but Cm Punk rises from the WWE.
Cm punks goes to the baby division
Was Seth channeling that Hangman promo that he did on  CM Punk in AEW?
We all knew it was MNR… Orton signed w/ SMD and feuds w/ the only good storyline there, NXT there’s not much for a big superstar to continue his career.
I am glad CM Punk picked Raw.. CM vs Seth. It's gonna be interesting can't wait.
Just fire CM punk already so we can get to better storylines... please
Everyone who thought Seth was genuinely THAT mad about cm punk coming to wwe, you have been worked. If Seth was truly that mad, he woulda dropped the belt and quit
CM Punk needs to be careful. Seth had injured Sting, he fought him.  Seth did that.
Feud of 2024 🔥😮‍💨
I just want him to come out to “ This fire burns” and hear him yell out “ it’s cobbler time”
This should be night 2s main event we all know this is going to be way better than Cody and Roman. Romans part time anyway he Shouldn't get handed it. May have had the title longer but Seth probably still defended more times. This is wrestling at its best blurring the lines
Is this guy ever going to pretend fight or is he just going to talk every time?
Well tbh if punk wouldnt left seth  would still be a midcard
Keeps dressing like Joseph Seed from far cry 5
Would have liked to see him beat Roman at Mania, but we knew that was never gonna happen.   This will be a really good fued tho
This feud gone elevate Seth & the world title Raw definitely needed punk
This is the Seth Rollins i wanted back again. The serious verion, not the knockoff joker verison.
Finally, wrestling is interesting enough for me to start watching again.
I go for Rollins. Good age, to be on top the world.
Analytics
Somewhere Tony Khan is punching the air.  This could have been CM Punk vs. Kenny Omega.
So basically Seth is cutting the same promo he did with Cody Rhodes as well.. 😒😒
THANK YOU, JACK PERRY
Shawn vs Bret 2.0
Is anyone else worried about Punk vs Rollins? Rollins has a pretty intense style, and Punk is fragile. Rollins will have to take it easy to put Punk over. That will be a bummer.
CM PUNK HAS BEEN IN 6 ROYAL RUMBLE MATCHES  ROYAL RUMBLE 2007 ROYAL RUMBLE 2008  ROYAL RUMBLE 2009 ROYAL RUMBLE 2010  ROYAL RUMBLE 2011 ROYAL RUMBLE 2014  CM PUNK Will BE COMPETING IN HIS 7TH ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH NEXT MONTH JANUARY 27  2024
Hangman did it first and it wasn't scripted.
CM Punk wants Seth Rollins.  Randy Orton wants Roman Reigns.    Both can dethrone the current champion at Wrestlemania after lengthy absences.  We're in a new age, Folks.
Go Seth go Seth!!! Tell him!!! Omg idk who’s side to be on…can I just pick both😅
These crowds are so lame
Seth heel turn incoming
Good job WWE writers. You guys took what MJF vs CM Punk did in AEW and are doing it in your show now. Sad to watch punks carrier go down the crapper.
zzzzzzzzzzz wake me when Punk does ANYTHING interesting.
Didn't think WWE could get any better.  Well it literally just did
Cm Punk as a babyface seems so fake & insincere.
So sick of Seth he acts like bewatch
😂
Cm punk personality very close to Vince  Wwe needs his charisma Rating will sky rocket. Since Brock is gone
And just like that, Punk managed to make the World Heavyweight Championship feel credible.
Can we get rid of overrated guys like Seth!
Can’t wait for cm punk to get injured on his first match
Seth isnt wrong
I have never like Seth so they is that I get why Seth doesn't like him.
I hate cm punk with a passion
Nice suit SETH
Did they edit lines out of this?
Seth having this type of energy with Punk and Cody, imagine the magnitude of feud if Moxley ever returns, It'll be like punk 2x
Genuinely really hope Punk takes the title from Rollins
Seth should be thankful Punk left because he never would’ve got his opportunity to step up if he didn’t
Brothers and sisters, he had brothers and stabbed them in the back 💀💀
Seth Seth Seth 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Imagine Rollins vs Punk WrestleMania 40 Saturday main event, Becky interference trying to help her husband, then BAM!!!! AJ Lee shows up to defend CM Punk, and you start a rivalry there as well, what a main event that would be for either Saturday night or Sunday night?
Your DAD chooses his brand !
So weird to hear cm punk constantly talk in the 3rd person😂
10 years of us fans screaming his name after he left. But they only like to sing Seth song lol
I really hope he wins the Royal Rumble and would make a great story. Maybe add Stone Cold as a ref to make things more interesting.
CM punk always had the Hype...  he doesn't repect the game
🔥🔥
I fell asleep the first 5 minutes
my gosh edge should’ve never left for aew
Rollins kind of sounding like a big baby. Last he said he didn't like Cody Rhodes last year and now he come to CM Punk face saying that he hates him with a passion.
"I hate you". That sounded pretty legit.
Hard not to root for CM Punk against this pampered star Seth
Punk better take the title.
Promo was better when Hangman delivered it
Facts tho cm punk held the WWE hostage and tried to sabotage it then comes knocking back!!! GTFO!! Seth is loyal cm punk isn't!!! And triple h is fool to bring him back
Seth Rollins really just gave us the Hangman Adam Page promo
One guy gets a huge pop for being legendary status, as for the other guy, WWE had to create a cool fan interactive theme song to make it seem like he’s a hit. Essentially stole the fan interest in Sami Zany's song to get him over. Seth’s music > then him.
WWE RAW WCW Smackdown
Rollins/lynch. Vs Punk/AJ Lee. Wrestlemania.   Make it happen
Oh yes the confrontation we’ve been waiting for.
Maybe the belt will finally have meaning after all
I’m just happy to see wrestling being must see tv again
This gon be so dope
Lot people on here sure do like Hangman Adam Page’s promo that Seth Rollins plagerized
We are looking at the modern day shawn vs bret
Duh it would be raw
Don’t put that belt on cm punk
Not Seth geniously referencing hangman’s promo 😂 lol I love it, you can even see the change of expression on Punks face
A dude comes out to a song that screams burn it down, and then says it's bad that another guy tears down WWE. ???
This is Hulk vs Rock of 2023. One proven superstar leaves, comes back, and a once blossoming now main event superstar is there to "welcome back" said former superstar. This feud is everything
Oh wow. WWE may reach its highest peak since late Attitude Era.
Great promo from both! Welcome Back CM Punk!
Punk is so watered down in PG era
If punk happens to win against Rollins at WM it will be a very bad decision. He’s 45 years old . For Rollins to put him over is a bad business move
Seth is a crybaby!
Hangnail did this promo better.
Someone choosing Seth to complete a story cause my tribal chief ain’t goin ☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿
Wwe has fallen so far. Ppl excited to see 2 normal dudes wrestle lol. This dude looks like he's 50 yrs old..why do u ppl watch this??😂
CM Punk> Seth Rollins any day of the week twice on Sunday
The AEW reject going for the WWPG Participation Heavy Wheat Championship.
Magnificent that is all.
God that suit ...... 🤢
That I love u guys and grin was evil 👿 asf 😂😂😂
I'm with Seth Rollins 👍
Im with Seth 100% cant stand CM PUKE never liked him
Cm punk finna carry RAW
So is Rollins heel or Punk heel?
I love when they speak from their hearts RAW EMOTION ‼️
Rollins is a cry baby haha. I hope Punk takes his title
More like y2j vs hbk
he looked at the "callener"
Seth: Punk, I do t want to take you off guard, but you know that Hangman promo? Punk: Say less, and let’s make this money
Punk is gonna GTS the Jiddler outta Seth's stupid face 😂😂😂😂
Hangman Page did Seth's promo better in AEW...and it wasn't scripted there either.
Hey USA Seth confronted punk but ok
Adaaaaaam!! 😂😂😂
I’m just saying this was weak compared to the MJF segment Punk had. He is now PG Punk.
Mjf did this a billion times better
Go Seth!
What is the deal with Seth freaking Rollins beef with CM Punk?
I miss new jack 🤦
2 roh originals getting ready to blow the roof off I’m glad after 5 heart attack’s I get to see Tyler black and cm punk get it on one more time. God I love professional wrestling
I want CM Punk vs Rollins at WM40 and Damien cashes in...
He's running around looking for his   daily bread
trash. your just going to hand it over to cm punk like that? pathetic. why do they do this? please answer me. why do they do some cool stuff and then around the end of the year up to wrestlemania they have the absolute worst writing that makes the big premium shows terrible. The rumble isnt even fun anymore. wrestlemania is a joke of an event. just go back to writing it good please. stop purposefully killing it.
I hate him too rollins n love you ❤
Cm Punk wins the Royal Rumble! And challenges Seth freakin Rollins
What makes this so good is that we know they have real animosity for one another.
Seth is Right
WWE is on 🔥🔥🔥
Seth bullied Punk on the mic there was no coming back from that💯😂
Seth spoke the truth
take the logo off the mic again like you always did in AEW you brown-noser, last straw mark
Adam Pierce so lame
I genuinely think the “I hate you” comment was actually real 👀👀👀👀
The royal rumble is gonna be epic
seth is right he left wwe and tore it down then he went to aew and did the same thing now hes back to do it all over agin
Wait...so adam pearce offered orton a championship match to join raw but not cm punk, that makes no sesne lmao.
Going to elevate both Stars. Time for Seth to get serious. I love it
Punk yawn
This will be an epic match and possibly an epic mixed tag match
He was the goat he ran ECW for sure
My money is on Seth Rollins score 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
It feels so weird to see WWE finally give us what we want. It’s like I’m hesitant to get back into WWE because I’m so use to them letting us down with poor storyline writing
Punk keeps things interesting.
I like how they just didn’t make him a heel we love Seth 😊
really smart getting punk back hes going to bring the best out of rollins like we havent seen since the shield days
I kinda wanted to see Punk vs Reigns at wrestlemania. 🤷‍♂️
Confronted by Seth Rollins*
2 times Seth had to carry washed up boys who ran to the opposing companies & the crawled back, while Roman gets to be a part timer & fight scrubs
This was the right call. CM punk on raw and LA Knight on Smackdown.
3:14 That's an Aew diss showing that full crowd.
Cody Seth and cm punk and sami
Wwe is just a pale shadow of what it used to be. Glad i got to grow up with the golden era instead of this garbage lmao
Anyone esle get cena vs rock 1 vibes or rock vs cm punk vibes.. they go back and forth.. cm punk wins royal rumble and faces Seth rollins.. cm punk wins because he the new returning favorite face then loses to probably whoever is the next face at the moment. Probably Jey Uso. Naw not jey lmao!!!!!!!
What a beautiful way to end 2023
They haye each other😅
Bring back Enzo
Seth going into business for himself! Punk don't like that. 😅 Ask Hangman Adam Page.
its been almost a month and i still cant beleive cm punk is back. i cant wrap my head around it. what im seeing doesnt feel real
Dude....took a break from wwe a yr ago....now that punks back i took the weekend, got caught up with a yrs worth of storylines, the best matches, etc....and im ready cause this seems to be a good time to start watching again!!
CM Punk should've said 'The last time someone said that to me, I took their title AND main event status'.
Seth Rollins with the Adam Page promo
Rollins towering over him
Anybody else remember hearing that “protect this place from you” line anywhere else?🤔
As usual, WWE went right down to business and do the hard stuff, something Tony Kahn could never do. Rollins and Punk needed this confrontation before the fire dies down. Even if they’re fighting at mania, they still need to constantly confronting each other to build it up. Maybe give Punk Dominik on raw or elimination chamber and then Rollins at mania.
Just wrestle.
Cm punk didn't confront him😂😂😂😂 Seth Rollins confronted cm punk .. WWE writers got it wrong😂😂😂😂
Rollins just sounds like a smart mark who watches AEW on the regular.
We gotta get Ross and Dub in this storyline
Truthfully, I didn’t think hearing an apology from CM Punk would make me feel a sort of way but hearing him say sorry reminded me dang I was sad he left. Maybe it’s just adulthood hitting so I didn’t pay mind to it, but Thanks PB, I wish 10 years ago was a better place but today will do, and it’s okay to do what you got to do 🙏🏼💪🏼 that being said, hey reader, hit up that person you haven’t spoken to in a while, even if it’s literally a “hi” and nothing else, there’s some closures we abandon thinking we might never see it and just sometimes it doesn’t need to be like that
This is the best "Worst staredown" I've ever seen!
Nothing better then watching a pretentious entitled idiot refer to himself in the 3rd person.
CM Punk looks old & frail.
I mostly read up on wrestling now a days, haven’t been that interested in quite some time, but this feud here caught my attention for sure! I can’t wait to see how this storyline plays out
Seth will probably turn heel
Already tired of Punk’s babbling
im anti punk but seth coming together to give us this masterpiece is a must watch😂😂😂
CM Punk literally makes me throw up in my mouth.   He's so phony is ridiculous and yet everyone cheers smh
I want Seth's jacket!
Cm punk let Seth have his moment and get stuff off of his chest.. watch the build up though. Can’t wait for cm punk to wreck Seth on the mic. Mark my words.
Looks like the main events are set for Wrestlemania 40:  Night 1 Main Event: Seth Rollins vs CM Punk for the World Heavyweight Championship   Night 2 Main Event: Roman Reigns vs Cody Rhodes for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship
This is Hangman vs Punk all over again. Punk is taking that title.
He’s so good on the mic. One of the best in the buisness and Seth is right up there with him
This going to be a good fued
They should do the co winner royal rumble with punk and Cody at the rumble
Booooooring
I’m so reddy to see the insults and roasts that cm pump and Seth Rollins are going to do to each other
I feel bad because now cody is stuck in the shadows
CM Punk has me feeling like a teenager again! Welcome back!!
I'm still in awe of CM Punks promo skills but on the other hand, his wrestling has become rusty. That remains to be seen
I can't stand Seth cry baby
Seth went Adam Page like lol
Obviously he was going to raw they always sign with the current show they are appearing on
WWE is the best! I’m so excited 😊
Seth freakin Rollins well said hoping for you to retired CM Punk from wrestling for good. This dude should have never come back to WWE.
The one guy to actually give Brock Lesnar a fight and made Seth Rollins...everyone is mad at him is making this kinda ironic given creative control 10yrs ago!!!😂😂
Cm pink got old …compared to seth
One ghost Punk steered clear of was getting squashed by Moxley for the title.
🔥
Oh my god he mentioned my hometown 💀
Seth killed this promo
Please retire crybaby bully punk once and for all Rollins.
seth rollins got a point he stayed even  wrestle while hurt while punk left n did everything to tear down wwe.
When can it be January 27th already I can’t wait that long
Seth Rollins cut a way better promo here
This is one of those rivalries where us as fans can’t pick who we want to win
Crowd was trash
🎉 Botchamania 🎉 bout to catch every cm knee buckle
he was in mma and they almost killed him so he came back to wwe where its all fake
Omg rollins with the hangman page promo. 😂 And we saw exactly how that turned out .
I hate him too seth. Boo punk booo!!!! BOOOOOO
Wrestling is stupid and wrestling fans are puppets.
Ready for WWE 2K24 so i can play as Punk
Also maybe we'll see the wives get involved with a return of aj.
I prefer heel punk but it’s prolly impossible
This promo was🔥
Just like 2013 n the Video game 🎮  raw is where he really belongs 💯
8:42 Hangman Adam Page be like: 😏
Ngl is kinda weird to me that the current champ seems so bothered by a return it feels jealous
Weird I thought he was loved at aew soo what happen did they turn on them? He seems so happy here. Seems his last hurrah
Remember John Doe from New York said that Seth Rollins saying "no one wants CM Junk back!" that didn't age well. I wonder where he's at now?
I honestly think most of this was shoot
Smackdown roman returns. Reigns is going to destroy punk  when he gets on mic. Saying punk did the smart thing and went to raw instead of facing him on smackdown cuz punk knows what he knows is even cm punk could never beat roman reigns. Thats y punk is running to raw scared to face the truth. Or something like that
Whys punk always licking his lips?😂😂😂 creep.
I've said it before and I'll say it again, 2024 match of the year.
Excited for WrestleMania already!! It definitely can’t come any sooner, but it’s gonna be exciting!!!
Let him know Seth Rollins. F U CM PunK!!!!!!
That was a really bad edit around the 7:25 mark.
Rollins shouldn't be criticizing only CM Punk for tearing down WWE after leaving it. You know why ? because his former buddy Dean Ambrose, or Jon Moxley (or whatever you wanna call him), is doing the same thing. In the same AEW company that CM Punk just got fired from.
This is giving me shawn and bret flashbacks
Still un real
Fragile Phil
I can see Seth Rollins going to sleep real soon
This is gonna be a build up match! I love it.
“I’m not here to make friends, I’m here to make money”
More then likely punk is gonna win rumble and challenge seth which i hope they do but to pick a side i cant cuz i like both
Seth needs this feud his gimmick is not really working maybe this will turbocharge him
Really needed something other than Bloodline business. Nothing draws money like real heat! Can’t wait to see this develop
CM Punk promo was so good to me I will never miss another Raw now that he's back, thanks Triple H
I’m already playing it in my head haha. Gonna be a 5 star.
CM Punk promo was so good to me I will never miss another Raw now that he's back, thanks Triple H
Theyre dumb for editing out the whole 2 min stare down they had. 🤦‍♂️ I felt the intensity in the building all the way here in Tx!!  Watch the full version!!
CM Punk promo was so good to me I will never miss another Raw now that he's back, thanks Triple H
Two of the best wrestlers in the world
Look everyone... The failed UFC fighter 😂😂
CM Punk promo was so good to me I will never miss another Raw now that he's back, thanks Triple H
Seth elevating himself and that title very well now.
This has 🤑 all over it
CM Punk promo was so good to me I will never miss another Raw now that he's back, thanks Triple H
cm punk looks too old
Even if cm punk entered the women's royal rumble he couldn't win he a joke an all these idi**ts who think he great r hilarious
That scowl that he gave at the beginning before he grabbed the mic was Colby. Not Rollins lol and he pulled an Adam Page on Punk. Lol
Love, Love , Love My Seth but can't wait till Punk kicks his azzz
Should have taken the NXT DEAL
WWE IS BACK BABY!!!!!!
Rolins would destroy punk in a real fight... But since it's fake.... Punk will be given a chance
He gotta take a cycle
This ain’t the same punk we had. This isn’t the good punk. This is a brand new PG Punk
I stopped watching wrestling when CM punk quit WWE 10 years ago. This is the second Raw I've watched in a decade. Besides watching YouTube clips of the attitude Era, I actually turned my TV on to watch this.
Never Before But Love CM punk Now !!! Waiting for Jeff to get Straight ❤️
Adam Page to CM Punk: I’m protecting AEW from you!  Seth Rollins to CM Punk: I’m protecting WWE from you!  Interesting….
That's not a WM match I would wanna see
this wouldve been PERFECT without the forced crowd noise. The “hair dryer” pop if you will. Im watching WWE again BECAUSE of Punk, it wouldve been better if they just played the natural reaction from the audience,
I don't care if Punk stays face and Rollins completely turns heel again.  Im going to continue to be team Rollins.  Never will i ever be team punk.  And thats the bottom line wheather Stone Cold said it or not 😂 lol.
Hangman Page vs CM Punk 2.0?
Best return, best promo, gonna be a Dave Meltzer 5 star. I will fight anyone disagrees
OH GOODY CM PUNK IS BACK FOR BANK!! GOODY!!
I just hope he stays
Never liked Rollins more
Punk is gonna get injured.... Dude is so old.
Please triple g make this two solid matches at mania punk Vs Seth and Rollins Vs Cody
The one thing  you can’t say is cm punk doesn’t always give it his all when he’s in the ring either on the mic or in the ring can’t wait for the royal rumble
Seen this already - Page vs Punk.
Well we know they will allow him to win the rumble
WOW WOW WOW!
This will be epic
This is just getting started ladies and gents
I KNEW IT! I CALLED THIS AS SOON AS THE VIDEO OF ROLLIN’S FREAKING CAME OUT
Cm punk gotta win royal rumble 2024!!!!
It’s amazing how WWE is going to make money off of a self created AEW storyline.
This is good.
8:53 Seth taking a page (lol) out of Hangman's book and stole his promo 😂
WWE IS FREAKIN COOKIN BRO  PUNK  ROLLINS  CODY JEY GUNTHER MIZ DIY DREW LYNCH SHOOT EVEN NIA are all apart of some intriguing ishhhhh
They better not give CM Punk no title this early
Pink is so disingenuous.
Cm 🤡
You talk too much.
seth rollins referencing hangman's promo? 🫣 8:56
Punk came back because he knows Cena ain’t coming back no more to take the PPV’s.
The next cena vs the rock
Punk has to earn his roses again. Elevate wwe to new heights like a professional and you shall have them! Do it like seth and john cena!
Seth comes off like a cheesy comic book villain. Now's the time to pull back on the character and go for realism
Songs exactly like the hangman Paige vs punk promo like exactly
Rollins lose I might be done .. if RANDY lose im done.
I guess all those clowns chanting C.M Punk forgot he  said he'd never want to ever step in a wwe ring again what a hypocrite. And he said he came back to make $ not friends.
Seth coming out in a velvet rhinestone suit is soooooooo rich!
This story line is probably like 50 percent legit and 50 percent fake
This is good. This feels real.
So he apart of the raw roster
seth is abt to shine
I can respect that CM punk wanted to earn a title shot and not just it get handed to him
Of course raw guy
Seth should retain over Punk night one at mania and then Cody should win on night two
I didn’t like how they stole the protecting ____ from you from AEW.
i haven’t liked rollins this much since king slayer, and i’m a punk mark 💀 i hope they get more promo time together if it makes both of them get elevated together
Punk scared 😱
Paul Heyman wrote a fire promo for Seth !
So his match is the rumble
I love that Seth isn’t being portrayed as a heel, he’s very much a face who has a very real reason to hate another face. I’m looking forward to this rivalry and seeing how the fans will get riled up.
If he says “ladies and gentlemen” one more time, I’m going to light my hair on fire.
Epic
Triple H is a genius on creative
This personal he walked out on seth
Loved it!   Haven’t said that about a lot of WWE stuff lately. But, loved this.
This is just the beginning  of the most awesome feud cm punk vs seth rollins at wrestlemania 40
🍿
This is fire
The emotion in this segment was beyond real. It's cool they are using the hate towards punk to fuel this
Lol Seth copying hangmans "protecting it from YOU" promo 😂
Well they made it obvious here. CM Punk is definitely winning The Royal Rumble....lol
Hangman Seth Rollins!!!
Bottom line who beats.Roman.
He will be out of WWE in a year or 2
With the Joker color outfit and the laugh lol,Only Seth
Wwe are gonna clown him
Chooses his brand? He was always going to raw just as orton was to smackdown. As if they would ever draft them to the brand of the show they weren’t currently on
If we're being honest Seth owes a lot of his success in WWE to Punk. Paved the way BIG TIME for the Indy guys.
Really hoping aj Lee returns too:)
Hilarious how he parts his hair on both sides, trying to hide that reced
Rip aew lol
He also lost his UFC debut in that building
This is about to be can’t miss tv. These promos are gonna be 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This and the staredown should have ended Raw.. the Cody Rhodes ending was very anticlimactic
That mean Cody win the royal rumble
Special. You think you're Special. You do. I can see it in your eyes.
Great promo.......literally everyone is standing in that crowd
I wish these videos would show the pop cm punk gets when he walks out.
Cm.  Sux
Hi
The fact there is legit beef between these two. Chef kiss
Y'all native dean Seth roman don't like punk lol what if The shield reunited to attack punk
CM Punk is about to show up and show out 🔥 someone needs to put Seth Rollins in his place once and for all 💯
Rollins > Punk
I’m rooting for Seth Freakin Rollins, I hope Punk loses the Royal Rumble
Moar please
I been waiting for this rivalry.
Geeat rollins promo. Best promo outside of a bloodline promo in years.
I hate cm punk
The cult of personality vs the generic crybaby
The prodigal son has returned
This is gonna be awesome 😂
Great. Now we get to see the storyline that should have played out in AEW had everyone been professional about it. Good move by WWE.  I think Seth Rollins even moved like Hangman when he said the protect them from you line.
This brought me to tears I was so hurt when he left
cm punk will win the royal rumble!
Side note anyone know where I can get that suit that Seth’s wearing lollll
CM Punk. Overrated fraud.
Cm punk is so boring. Weak promos.
I love it
This is so corny and laughable 😂
Seth does the same promo Page did lol but the difference here is that Rollins is actually a star
Seth
Step a side  ponytail CM punk 💪 is back
Not a fan of Seth's music or whatever this whole eccentric thing is...
This feud is gonna be huge!!!
CM punk go play neck bungee jumping
dude gonna ruin raw
Hold up , This cm punk character is winning me over right now , 😮
Definitely giving John cena and the rock
Louisville, KY shoutout! Let’s go!
CM punk is Booooooring
Seth Rollins looks amazing with that title
These fake audience noise is annoying
That Seth Rollins theme song is already annoying time for him to drop that belt he’s no champ title run is garbage,
When I got my rumble tickets, I had no idea what a road to Mania it would be! So hyped!
Same corny promo he gave at aew 😂😂😂
CM Punk arrives, Seth raises his game up
punk is a hypocrite hes dodging roman or he a big phony
Probably biggest mistake Tony Khan ever made and will make! The Bucks don’t fill seats! Seats = Money
CM Punk gets put out for five years if not permanently
Can we please get an updated cm punk Jeff Hardy intro 😂
I hate how they have to limit punks promos. He should have demolished this cornball on the mic but i have no doubt in my mind seth is responsible for limitings punks words against him. Smh
would have been great if Seth had said "tell me when I'm telling lies" when he was pointing out punks hypocrisy.
Wow, 70 yrs & I've never cared bout a promo or a story of Seth's until this one. Only other rivalry he's had worth talking bout was with Cody. Welcome back Cody & Punk lol, us older True wwe fans have missed you guys.
History from their RoH days…this is going to be a great rivalry
I was born in 2009 so growing up a lot of wwe wrestlers were gone or retired amd not to mention seth rollins was in his authority stage but I wish I was alive in 2003 when ppl were fussing but still having matches with each other
Sounds like another Rock and John Cena angle
Dean Ambrose need to return next
Maybe? he better come for seth.
Corny promo
😳 you feel the electricity dream match  This is why WWE is king
Little do yall know this rivalry benefits both of them cause now they both get to main event wrestlemania they rightfully deserved for years
Y'all really buying this?
Of course he thinks he deserves a title shot
Nun but old wrestler give young ones opportunities
Your two biggest stars are AEW rejects! 😂😂
This segment right here is more interesting than anything we’ve got in the past 4 years
I already  know Seth Rollins hates cm punk 🤦  lol:)
Seth better be ready to get feed to cm punk
Punk is so good that slow turn when 😂 Seth’s theme played was perfect same look I have when I’m about to go on  break and I’m stopped by a customer
Wait so you telling me we can get Punk Vs Seth to headline Night one of the 2 night wrestlemania extravaganza!? sign me up such a good matchup 🔥
Someone handed Rollins the same script Adam Page used….
Rollins going heel
Seth Rollins was looking like a little dog just barking away while cm punk just didnt care the loudest in the room is the weakest he didn't say much he just let Seth Rollins make himself look like a fool
Dam shame..Barkley trip on some grass and fumbled.. the pack on the move again..21-16
This is going to be a generational feud in terms of promos alone. I still don’t know what Punk will be like in the ring.
A soulless copy and paste promo stolen from a lesser company with a guy that's an overrated malcontent who changed wrestling for the worse by conning the office that indy guys are draws .   CM Punk and his fans are the reason wrestling's dead...
I'm done watching wwe I believe I can watch other things I enjoyed it years ago but it just isn't good anymore
How u copyright this
Seth was obviously talking about Colt Cabana. Right? 😂😂😂
This is the only time I've heard a crowd activity go against Seth's chant and cheer for the other guy. This feud should be gold.
I can make your decision EASY. Go to Impact.
Rollins with some valid points! I’m Team Rollins!
I really hope Rollins doesn’t lose the title to this guy! 🤬
So much for fighting roman storyline
Seth is still crying 😂
If he wins the royal rumble I'm done with wwe.
Did he just read the notes in his palm??? 😂😭
Okay, quick thing. He signs the contract right handed and his watch is on his right hand. My observations indicate most dominant hand people wear watches on their non dominant hand. Anyone else notice this?
If punk goes to wrestle mania and faces Seth. I hope priest cashes in and wins on him.
The two biggest indie marks in one ring.
Will Seth have this same energy if Moxley comes back?
This makes me like Rollins now
Isn’t this the same speech that Hangman Page gave CM Punk in AEW? This sounds almost exactly the same
Seth isn’t lying
Randy choosing smackdown should have been the clue who punk was gonna pick.
That honestly would be fckn wild for him to stroll back in and win the rumble 😭🤦🏻‍♂️
Seth turned into hangman 😅
Can we see CM Punk and Seth Rollins go to a Chicago Bears game together?
Seth rollings for the W 🎉😎
I wish AJ Styles interrupted the promo to say that this was the house that he built.
I've never been a big Seth Rollins fan, but I hope he takes this trash out back.
That editing was just not it , great segment but what was that lol
folks we are on the road to wrestlemania. Here we go.
Seth Rollin showing Adam Page how it’s done right.
What a joke. He can't wrestle anymore
You know DIS MATCH GONNA CRAZY since they already can't STAND EACH OTHER
This is actually the perfect feud for Rollins going into Wrestlemania! How controversial if whoever wins Priest cashes in on 😂 cuz they're not having Priest take the title off Reigns for sure
6 mins left the giants up by 8 ...pack on the move
the modern day bret and shawn fued
Rollins with his best Hangman imitation
Dude haven’t felt that charged up for we in awhile
The tension I feel it
Rollins gonna win!  He's to much for CM Punk!  Lol hahaha 😆
I hope Seth whoops Punk
Punk is still a b@#$%.
Best matches and stories come from real life heat
CM TRASH! 😂😂
This is going to be awesome
Here you go cm punk fans! when cm punk was put in a real mic vs mic he had nothing to say because seth rollins is right. Cm punk is not going to win rumble, that would be huge slap in the face to whoever they planned to win. He will still feud with rollins at mania. Unfortunate cm punk didn't have any backstage drama on seth rollins, looks like jack swagger on the mic.
Their match is gonna be similar to Orton and Triple H at Mania. Intense personal feud with a regular wrestling match
You could tell this was a "real promo" both guys cant stand eachother but have a passion for the business. This is gonna be a crazy good fued and a true test to both stars.
Absolutely amazing. Love Punk. Love Rollins. Hope this feud makes Seth more serious. Right now all Seth has is that song but he’s capable of so much more. Can’t wait for this feud
This is about to be the best feud in wrestling in years
Too bad they can't put a blue dot over Rollins' voice.
Seth was talking to Punk like how I tall to my brother when he eats the last of my rice. 🤣
seth > punk .. idc 🔥
Yes!!!!
*me from louisville* HE SAID LOUISVILLE RIGHT
This may be off the video topic, but Gunther seems like a good choice to dethrone CM Punk when he wins the WHC
Im waiting for Punk to come out to the sheild entrance. Imagine their music hitting, and then it goes to Punk and you see him standing in the crowd with a vest on. That would make Rollins livid. Fitting though, Punk started the shield and he wiuld get under Seths skin. Lol
No one else finds it weird that most of the stories people do with CM Punk are about how much the other wrestlers don’t want him around?
Seth better win
This is the perfect redemption arc.   I can see this being a Wrestlemania main event, especially with that promo. If Seth Rollins beats CM Punk at Wrestlemania and then shows CM Punk respect at the end, that would put both Seth and CM Punk over. Punk gets his redemption, and Seth elevated the title and his run to new hieghts.
I'm officially over AEW
This is what happens when 2 adults can do business with each other; an epic program and rivalry coming down the pike.
Like a girl's brother having "that talk" with her returning ex boyfriend
Lets just undo all the development of all the people in the back for Punk to do his run and such. ZZZzzzzZ
Seth "Hangman" Rollins
Wait. Didn't "Hangman" Adam Page say the same thing to CM Punk in AEW last year (with an exception to a GM/Authority Figure) or does both Zeth Rollins and "Hangman" Adam Page share the same writer???
Not interested 😢
OOOOOOOOOOOOO THE ADAM PAGE LINE IS LOWKEY KINDA INSANE 🤭🤭🤭
Don’t be fooled guys. Seth is happier than a pig in slop right now. CM Punk was one of his top dream matches.
Didn’t Adam “Hangman” Page cut the same promo 😂
Cm punk a clown. Always has been. Always will be.
Shawn vs Brett Remake  roles are definitely reversed
Rollins just  destroyed him and Punk had to sit back and take his medicine with little rebuttal.
Is Rollins a face or a heel?
🔥🔥🔥
Randy Orton kicks me in the head backstage 😂  punk was just one of the many victims of the Viper 🐍 He needs to stop crying and talking so much on every show like a broken record and start having matches.
In my opinion the Seth Rollins vs CM Punk feud should be a non-title match at WrestleMania. It would allow Damien Priest , La knight , Drew McIntyre or someone else a chance to become world heavyweight champion . Besides the Rollins vs Punk match is bigger than a title and it will still draw huge numbers and CM punk can get a championship a little later.. 🤔 just saying
Here's hoping for a successful run similar to when Shawn came back from surgery, few expected him to come back after that at that time. But goes to show you anything is possible in wrestling, if we just stay hopeful! 👌
CM PUNK!!!! LFG 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Should’ve ended with a Seth “joker” like laugh
The End is now Seth Rollins is going to Sleep 😴 zzzz
Seth Rollins is RIGHT
We all should thank jungle boy for making this feud happen
Well seth is not lying. Cm punk is a hypocrite.
CM Punk igniting that fire.
It’s been a minute since I’ve been this hype
Sorry Seth it’s hard to take a guy in glitter skinny jeans seriously as a tough guy. You’re not fooling anyone
He should have gone to smackdown
If cm up I loses we riot
This fued has all the ingredients to be epic
Seth was TWEAKING 😭😂🤣🤣
I hope they can mend things, either way the matches are gonna rock
No whining aye Rollins!!!! that's why punk is a goat, he was like "stop whining in your promos" boom Rollins achieved a new skill all love, do ya job
That's how you steal someone's thunder 😅
Wack,Rollins was throwing a fit like a little girl and he gets in the ring and that's all he says no rara face to face 😂😂😂
Really hope they give Seth this win lol
Dear Hunter,Thank you💪🏾😎
Am I the only one that’s like… what’s the point of asking Adam pierce to come to the ring just to end the promo and leave lol
Rollins is using the Hangman Adam Page reasoning
Punk need to be a executive cause I dnt get a ounce of enthusiasm from this dude. SUPER DUPER OVERRATED
Take Seth’s title away
I love how he’s making it sound like the Raw and Smackdown fans aren’t the same people.
The most unathletic wrestler in the business. That's the truth.
let me talk too ya yeahhhhhhhh
So is Rollins a heel now?
"i wish we had more time"
This is the modern day Bret Vs Shawn feud
So ashamed of Seth to be disrespectful to his father.
Is that seth Rolland or russ the rapper
Breaking news!! CM Punk took Rollins promo to heart and started throwing chairs and punching people backstage
Punk is 44, looks like hes 55, wrestles like hes 64,  Rollins isngiing to wrestle circles around Punk and Punk will gas  out in 3 minutes
I know it's just been 4 appearances, but Punk is feeling lukewarm right now. Im not sensing that spark that he had when he first returned to the business. This feud is big money though, so only time will tell
this was exactly what it should’ve been. this is Rollins best promo in years and perhaps the best non-bloodline related promo of the year. In my humble opinion.
🤣 in that 10 year time frame Seth Rollins was trying to get CM punk to return. So how TF can Seth even say what he said. Trust me I like them both but my question is exact.
Bro CM Punk is boring AF to listen too 😂 Talking way to much
Wwe just got better love it
Seth Rollins is terrible on the mic compared to CM Punk
This is going to be fantastic.
Seth Rollins vs CM Punk & Cody Rhodes vs Roman Reigns at Wrestlemania 40 is about to cook and be absolutely insane!!!
This is the single best case scenario between these two. Now I'm interested again.
punk is heel. they love it
I SMELL HEEL SEEEEEEEETH!!!!!!!
This is a rehash of the Hangman promo against Punk in AEW. He even uses the similar words. “I’m not gonna be defending this title against you, I’m going to be defending this company from you.” -Adam Page “I will do everything in my power to protect it from people like you.” -Rollins
Dude I hope it doesn't play out like the other place because Seth said the samething that another wrestler said
Two of the worst wrestlers in the business. Punk is washed and Rollins is over pushed and overrated.
Flashbacks of Hangman’s promo against him
Cm cancer! Just ridiculous.
Dang you can actually feel his real life hatred for Punk lol 😂
This is whats gonna happen... Punk is gonna be babyface Punk until he wins the royal rumble and makes it to wrestlemania. Then he is gonna cheat to beat Seth and turn heel and start a stable of his own and dominate raw for a year as Rollins becomes massive babyface chasing him all year. Meanwhile over on Smackdown there will be a triple threat with LA Knight, Roman and Cody and the twist is LA Knight is about to pin Roman but the bloodline turns on Roman and starts following Cody who turns heel. Cody pins LA Knight. Roman disappears for a while, Cody is the new leader of the bloodline and the champion. LA Knight chases him all year long and becomes Stone Cold Steve Austin, essentially.
Why do they have to spoil every video in the title. Wonder who he picked since him and Rollins confronted eachother
You knew you were going to sign with Monday night Raw when you were on Smackdown a few days ago.
WWE needed people who don't like  each other 😂 creates a competitive environment so long as they stay professional
They really don't like each other in real life huh? I can totally feel Seth super tense through the whole thing as a matter of fact it looked like he wanted to say more than just that but hey it's tv and you can't let your feelings run all over ...
BOO! Send him back to the UFC.
Nice Hangman Reference Lmaoo
Cm punk is str8 🌽
Is Seth Rollins really dumb punk was there longer when Seth was nobody and in NXT
I can potentially see a Seth heel turn soon 🧐
Remember the coked up, monster sized men cutting promos....now we have this....wimpy annoying dorks pretending to be tough. Boring A.F
I guess that's why CM Punk lost the defamation case because he was the one slandering people. Oh wait! He won the defamation case he left because he had a staph infection that wasn't being treated and he had every right to leave. Also it was because of CM Punk that Seth Rollins got called up to be the third member of The Shield, if we're going to take a walk down memory lane let's make sure we give an accurate account.
Honestly, it's starting to remind me of HBK's second run. He went away, did some other things, decided what he wanted in life and what was most important. Came back and had the best run of his career. Here's hoping the same for CM Punk.
Ugh... I absolutely want punk to win the RR.... buuut, did this jinx it? Are we going to get the same story of him somehow making it into a newly modified ME at WM? Isk... but im here for it
Just get to it already jesus
CM Punk will prevail over that made up gimmick called Seth Rollins...
Oh my. The money they are going to print with this feud!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤"It's clobbering time! Again!😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
A heel Punk?
This straight out of universe mode I swear to god 😭
Like the brand split is consistent lol
Is it just me or did Seth essentially cut the same promo that started the CM Punk collapse at AEW. Acknowledging the real, outside the ring history of Punk is about to elevate this feud. I hope one day Super Eyepatch Wolf covers the CM Punk story like he did for Roman Reigns.
The Raw belt look 🔥
This is going to be a fantastic feud.
Seth rollins sounded like Adam page.
id be more interested in cm punk wrestling triple H's blazer. seth just doesnt interest me, hasnt since before he turned in MOTB at WM
You know what if Jey and Jimmy main event night 1 of WrestleMania and Punk vs Rollins night 2 😱😳 ❤️
😎🎥🍿
WORLD HEAYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP BABY👑👑👑
Seth is not wrong with what he said
Does this segment feel familiar to anyone? Hangman/punk in aew?
Punk vs rollins at mania I'm on cm punks side
Seth suit is so nice and it’s gonna be an intense rively
This is going to be INSANE! Possibly one of the best storylines between 2 wrestlers we have ever seen
Punk wins the rumble (Cody repeating would be flat WWWE wouldn't do it) and goes for Seth. The "real animosity" is a good enough reason for him to pick Seth over Roman   Cody wins elimination chamber for the chance to fight Roman
The 2020's weird/fun time to be a wrestling fan?
Mickie James wwe return confirmed by CM Punk
We all knew this was coming...
This is gonna be a fire rivalry
Seth Rollins just became famous. Thank You CM Punk for making the WHC finally feel important now Edit: what a time to be witnesses to a Vince McMahon-less WWE. Wouldn't be seeing this if Vince had power
You can tell Seth is feeling some type of way. Rightfully so
what a horrible crowd. they were so dead
Can’t wait to see the handshake after their wrestlemania match
Please tell me that Seth has a pair of the Grimace crocs to match that suit
This is soooo awesome!!!!!
👑 Punk is ready to take out the clown 🤡 trash. Tomorrow's Tuesday trash day. Take his title
Give Shinsuke the belt already
I really miss cm punk 😊
facevsface ooooooooh
Rivalry of the year
Well, bro, LA Knight, literally the hottest guy in the company, is going to get screwed again out of a WrestleMania main event. Absolute nonsense.
Everything Seth said was real
"You slander me, my brothers and sisters in the back" Are we sure Seth is the heel here?
He just did the Hangman Page promo
Seth is an outstanding athlete! Sorry I don't like the stuff he has on now wish at least for this goes back to the black and bring back the evil.
Rollins cringe
Take notes AEW, this is how guys who don't necessarily care for each other, put their differences aside to make money!
Seth Rollins heel turn coming
I can't wait for the match.
Seth needs to interfere in the Rumble helping eliminate Punk setting up a match anyway for them at Wrestlemania and Cody wins the Rumble and faces Reigns
The fact that Punk beat the Shield in a handicap match almost 10 years to the day! Crazy.
Already boring storyline
gd I love HHH's WWE   LETS GO BABY
i like both of them a lot idk who wins
Hangman Adam Page feuds with CM Punk: goes into business for himself  Seth Rollins feuds with CM Punk: goes into business
Seth wasnt Wrong
Cm punk gonna make a great heel!
Heel turn??? 👀
Another year without Seth vs Reigns  😤😢
They did a good job on cooking this match 🔥
Seth Rollins: I hate you 😂😂😂😂😂
Punk as HW champ again 🎉❤
this is already so good.
And we all hate mr lynch
Can’t wait for punk to take that belt but I doubt they’ll do the right thing
I'm gonna be sad if this is his final match but ya know what, I can't think of anyone better than Seth Rollins
Rollins just looks like an insecure guy who knows he can easily replaced.
CM Punk is one of the greatest promos of all time. He is a great storyteller.
Now that was good!
Goosebumps.
Hypocritical Phil at his best.
I like this
CM punk new tshirt "I luv u guys"
This only works if its night 2 wm
Awesome
Guy is beyond boring as a face
The look on CM Punk face tells it all when Seth stop talking lol 😂 He had that smug look like “no this SOB didn’t”
i mean rollins isnt wrong.. look how many  WWE guys go over to  AEW and  bad mouth WWE
I NEED JOHN CENA VS CM PUNK 1 MORE TIME
CM PUNK MY IDOL IS BACK TO RAW BABY!!!
4:33 punk is reading the notes on his hand lmao. He botched this promo.
I'll say this for Punk - I don't enjoy him as a person, performer, talent, or much of anything really, but he definitely has that intangible that makes me want to tune in to see him fail, which is a testament to how good he is at making people invested in him. Dude is a draw wherever he goes.
Whenever the crowd goes Woooo ohhhhh ohhhhhhh for Seth I just instantly go the opposite direction and say. C M PUNK C M PUNK. Goes with the rhythm and Rollins fans would hate it lmao
Give Seth a GTS!
My two top favorites about to go at it. Hello 2024! WrestleMania 40 in the works. Yeehaw! I'm super excited
Seth so drippy I swea to god
I can't wait for the Rumble. It will come down to two men, Cody Rhodes, and CM Punk.
Seth Rollins will never be the star CM punk is.
Imagine.. cm punk wins the world heavyweight title from Seth that would be so CRAZY!!!🤯
Seth Rollins IS WWE 💯
Seth's a douchbag
Team Punk. Never been a Rollins guy
When I see CM Punk, I still think about AEW
CM Punk should win the 2024 Royal Rumble Match and feuds against Seth Rollins for the World Heavyweight Title at WrestleMania 40! 💯🔥
CM PUNK WILL WIN THIS GAME.  REVENGE IS ON!!!!!!!!!🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
I knew he was gonna choose raw since Seth gave him that 🖕🏽 as his welcome back. Plus Randy already chose smackdown.
Right before I watch this at 52 minutes post-posted, I just know it’s gonna go down in the history books.
CM Punk should of said "Seth, maybe its you im putting to sleep!"
Heel Rollins or Heel Punk incoming…
This is incredible
Seth's sounding exactly like Hangman Adam Page right now. I'm sure that promo was completely coincidental.
This honestly feels like the next montreal
All shield members really hate punk with a passion, huh?
I would love it if Seth enters the Royal Rumble just to stick it to CM Punk and make sure he doesn’t win but of course they won’t let that happen
Seth "Drippin" Rollins and Dirty Dom Mysterio are the candidates for 2023 MVP Of The Year. Who youse got as MVP? Honorable Mentions: Gunther Chad Gable
Hes cool, but his monologues can drag
Seth sounded a lot like Hangman Page, wanting to protect the company from Punk lol. We know how that turned out
The fact he scoffed and smiled almost everytime at seth. I think weve found the one that doesnt let joker seth get him rattled up
Punk really is a miracle worker. He made Seth Rollins interesting again.
That suit is 🔥🔥🔥
Rollins vs punk Cody vs roman Wrestlemania
Face vs face
more like CM Punk send this indie jobber back to AEW AND ROH
Was hoping for Roman vs Punk
We all knew he was signing to raw Cs Randy sign to smack down and it’s a fued between both of them Seth and punk Seth have hate towards punk
Here’s my prediction for the Royal Rumble Match: Seth “Freakin” Rollins will make sure that CM Punk gets eliminated from the Men’s Royal Rumble Match and thus adding more fuel to their rivalry!
my dreams  there really is a god
My opinion Seth broke character and straight told CM Punk off and was straight honest and truth
Shocker punk is nothing but trash
Well CM punk vs Rollins at mania is confirmed!
Seth is not gonna be happy when he has to drop the title to CM Punk lol
This feels big time
PG Punk 🥱
Shut up and take my $
I like how Adam Page tried to cut the same promo on PUNK. The locker room doesn't want HIM.
Good opening promo from Punk. Good opening promo from Rollins. Terrible response from Punk to Rollins. Wow!
Excellent segment
All Punk had to say to seth..."werent you supposed to be my security?"
I can't wait for this feud
Seth is going 2burn it down
Well Punk did say he just wants to main event Wrestlemania, whether or not he gets the belt out of it who knows, and Wrestlemania will probably be a two day event again, so I see a scenario where Cody and Punk both get what they want. Cody may even win the men’s MitB in 2024 and finish the story of winning the WWE championship @ SummerSlam.
He doesn't seem to be going forward, I'll I keep hearing is old tales of why we don't want him. And keep your apologies
Seth cutting the “protect this place from you” promo was a stoke of genius.
What app can I watch wwe for free on mobile?
What happened to the audio during Seth's promo? They cut something out?
@beingtheelite This is how you “Draw Money” … biggest fumble of all time 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Now that things have been getting better with the story lines and character development it seems alot of folks wanna come running back and jump the line of people that helped build things back up🤔
Be careful with Seth Reckless
So he purposely waitied to today to sign.  You know whst this tells me Rollins knew or is smart enough to play it up early.  I think he knew
☝️ Jey Uso ☝️
Dudes a loser “I will never wrestle in wwe again” hahahahaha clown ran out of money
AEW is bush league
Rollins is a 1000 times better🤷🏼‍♂️
The question is can this punk still wrestle like he can still talk lol
Now this is a professional working promo
I can’t wait for this ride I love Seth ❤
6:06 what was that!?!?
Cm trash cm botch mania
Like 2010 all over again
Cm Punk is gonna win the royal rumble(idc, Cody isn’t going to win the royal rumble back to back)
Sounds a lot like CM Punk and Adam Page.... I'm protecting it from you
I wouldn’t waist my money on seeing cm funk lol
So Excited to see CM Punk go against Seth Rollins and hopefully Punk enters the Royal Rumble. But pretty sure it's gonna a world title match
Seth beef with him actually real it’s wild and it’s awesome adds to this story line
You guys cheering for a guy who got kicked out of AEW 😂😂😂
I honestly see this turning into a rerun of the Seth rollins and the fiend’s feud The crowd will forcefully turn Seth rollins heel by wrestlemania
I can’t wait for CM Punk to be world champion again.
The new WWE Raw music with its release is a major disappointment.  It's was a poor decision by the marketing nerds.  Why would you ever change? Pander to who? Let HHH (even ask Rick Rubin) to produce music choice. The vocals are atrocious whiney and obnoxious.  That's not trend, that's just a bad decision.  The new music is a fail despite the product getting better.
Seth Rollins and Boredom Reigns are everything wrong with WWE...The nonstop push of the shield needs to end now..
What a promo from Seth Rollins! With all the bad Joker impersonation I almost forgot how good he can be on the mic. Hopefully this is a sign he's ready to talk like a real human being again
👏👏👏👏👏 beautiful
I wanna take this seriously but can't help but be distracted by the fact that dude looks like the lovechild of Richard Simmonds and Grimace...
Dude needs a ruback shirt
They really about to turn rollins heel lol
Seth is stating facts.!!
The fact that the crowd doesn't know who to hear for is amazing. A true fued between two babyfaces. This is what Seth vs Cody should have been last year. While I hoped to see Seth vs Roman at WM40, Seth for Punk in the main event at WM40 would be so good.
That's what Roman said to Seth I hate you And now Seth says the same thing to CM Punk
Cant take Punk seriously. Washed up, out of ring shape and a complete blow hard.
I love how Seth stands up for wwe
Buckle Up 🍿
As someone who is "straight edge" and as "drug free" as is Punk, I've seen healthier alcoholics and crack fiends 😅
What Seth said about cm punk so true and I really appreciate the door slam Seth said.
Are fans gonna be mad that WWE is gonna be predictable having Punk win 2024 Royal Rumble just like Batista or Roman a decade ago?
They better not have Seth or Roman lose to this fool
I hate that CM punk don’t bring up Maven. F*ck CM punk after this.
Seth Rollins has a very valid point, and that is, that C. M. Punk actually DID abandon WWE, nearly 10 years ago! I have to side with Seth "Freakin" Rollins on this one. It's kinda nice to have C. M. Punk "Back", but how long will he stay THIS time, before he walks out again?!? Look at the history of C. M. Punk. Didn't he actually attack people, and even Tony Khan, in AEW? What's up with this guy?!?  If C. M. Punk keeps up with his variable attitude, then Triple H needs to fire C. M. Punk. I know he just came back, but C. M. Punk is carrying a huge chip on his shoulder. When things don't go his way, he loses his temper, and gets completely out of hand!  As I said: I'm with Seth "Freakin" Rollins on this one. C. M. Punk, being back in WWE could cause a lot of trouble for WWE, that's for sure!
Love him referencing OVW and WCW. This already feels so personal those emotions were too real
Say what u want but Triple H saved WWE (at least for me)
Seth might not actaully like punk but one thing for sure is that when it comes to money. They both speak that language fluently😂
This is going to be good but not for the reason everyone thinks.
I agree having CM Punk on Raw
🤣😂😂b anyone else laugh when Seth said I hate you
Seth interferes in the rumble and tosses punk out. The winner of the rumble picks reigns for wrestlemania and punk vs Rollins at wrestlemania.   Pay me my money wwe lol
I'm sorry, I can't take Seth Rollins seriously in a purple sparkly suit 😂
Dam bro.....To make a long story short please
Getem seth 💯
Hoping Cody and Punk finish the story at Mania and have a very similar moment to that of WM 20.
Punk should be back in line not feuding with the champ on his first back day here
Punk looks tired.
WORKED SHOOT!!!!!  Is there heat here yes but this sin't Hangman going into business for himself. Triple H is gonna use the heat to his advantage and make money off it
Colby Lopez is trash
Seth is right
Im ngl this feud might be the only feud as good as roman and jey uso imma need some popcorn for this
it's like when the middle brother gets brave and tries telling the big  brother how it's going to be.
Are you Team Punk or are you Team Rollins
History repeats
Seth is going to win
Am i the only one not happy with Punk being back?
CM Punk going to quit😂
Did Rollins remind anyone of a poor man's wish version of punk when he was younger?
Get him Seth!
CM Punk 💤
Adam page
Hope they run program passed mania. Been wanting this for awhile.  But Seth who's my guy since punk left hasn't gotten to punks level yet
The reaction on seth Rollins faces when cmpunk said he was going to enter the royal rumblal cmpunk said when he win he might be coming after seth but u never know how will win the royal rumblal
Definitely going to stretch this to mania for sure, WM40 going to go BANANAS, IMAGINE IF WE GET ORTON vs Reigns or Reigns vs The Rock!!!! Either way I'll be happy!!!!
Well Mondays will belong to cm punk
Some one tell hang nail to take notes. That's how you that promo
The feud of feuds. Gonna be f’n legendary
Seth ate this promo and Punk just high tailed it to the locker room. L Punk
Protect this place from people like you hmmm sounds like the hangman page promo punk hated so much that started all the drama in aew
Seth Rollins and CM Punk are like brothers storyline due to similar characters.
CM Punk has been back, but I haven't seen him in any wrestling matches yet, almost seems like a Roman Reigns, bunch of talking, but no action 😃
Cm Punk was talking raw a few days ago he didn't hold back at all.
He’s gonna explode soon, he always does never liked punk 🙄
Love this
Wrestlemania quality match
This is going to propel Seth into a main event level talent. Amazing.
I already knew it would be RAw
Honestly Rollins promo was fire.
So many marks Rollins got all of you marked up real good
If cm punk gets a title match this fast, I'm done. There is way better talent in wwe that deserves it more.
Rollins was like 👋👋 hi aye excuse me. Not gon take up much of your time. On everything cuzz...  But i hate y0u 💀💀😂😂
This is going to be so good CM PUNK vs SETH ROLLINS
That suit is 🔥 😮‍💨
Seth is right
Seth's going to turn heel
This feels like what would've happened if Punk and Hangman had turned their heat into business.
No
Awesome segment! Let's go!!
The fantasy is better than the reality. Very underwhelming segment.
😅😅😊yea punk tell it
This feud is going to elevate Seth so much. It already did with this segment.
why does it feels like seth rollins is defending WWE from CM punk?
the " i will do anything to protect it from people like you" is such stab at hangnail's punkass omfg lol
This feud has been a long time comin'.
Hi Jack Perry 👋😃
Rollins looking like a badazzled Saints row fan
They are throwing us for a loop he’s going after Roman
YESSIR
Yup he sure did have Mickie james on his arms I remember that Hope to see her back one more time
CM Punk is a sellout
WWE hasn’t had good feud in a minute this is gunna be a peak storyline
Good to have you back on Raw like the old days 👏
Seth Plays His Part Well 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Not Everybody Knows Seth And Punk Are Good Fans
Doesn't CM punk resemble a beat-up worn out older Freddie Prinze Junior ?
Wrestler very inspiring  wwe super stars  they all do great job  each and every woman and men all the kids inspire  by the wwe super stars  God bless  🙏
In another time before, CM Punk and AEW Collision were  held at the same venue Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland; September 2023. :)
Seth costing cm punk a royal rumble win 😭😭
FINALLY!!
Cody is a Raw superstar so he'll win the rumble and make his target Roman and then Punk will win the chamber to face Rollins.
Tell him when he's telling lies
I never understood why this guy had any traction in the wwe. Obviously I'm talking about CM. Seth Rollins is no bargain either.
Anti-hero tweener Seth goes crazy
Everybody already knew he was going to join Raw
Seth is 100% correct. This fued bout to be fire
CM Punk is back on Monday night Raw 😁👍💯🇺🇲
WWE just got an awesome Royal Rumble match setup
Seth is losing that title
This match is gonna be 🔥
The “best in the world” shouldn’t have to say so
The Seth pop had to make punk a lil proud deep down
Last year: “I’m protecting AEW from you”  This year: “I’m protecting WWE from you”
Absolutely perfect!!! Thank you Triple H… Seth and Punk!!’ You guys made me fall in love with wrestling and the WWE again!!!
Seth has a point
lol this heel turn from Cm punk gone be crazy.
I love Seth Rollins  ❤ when he said  he loves us has his family  we are his brothers and sisters  each ever once  in bk the raw show i been watching wrestling since I was 3yrs now my son watch it with me.
Game on!
Im really hoping Triple H saves this for Mania
Seth Rollins was so good on the mic here he’s right CM Punk left 10 years ago talked bad about WWE let’s let Seth Freaken Rollins tell it like it is  all of the sudden Punk wants to Come back just because he AEW run went down the toilet
punk is playing the phony nice guy perfectly
never thought we'd witness this
I bet CM Punk & Seth Rollins will have one of the best rivalries
This is what Hangman attempted to do with Punk but instead he went off script and the rest is history.
“This isn’t cm punk, this is pg punk!”
Honestly i was expecting more from seth 😂😂
Let's get AJ Lee vs Becky Lynch too!!
Can you imagine the story if Punk wins the RR?   First off, there's Seth Rollins and their beef but then you have Roman Reigns.....and PAUL HEYMAN!
Hangman Adam page shoot 2.0
Mega match
When did Punk slander the WWE? When he made references to the company when he was in AEW? Help me out here if you know. Lol I don't get the hate from Seth.
Reminds me of HBK and Bret Hart. Both hate each other in real life but have chemistry in the ring. This will be a awesome feud to watch.
I love how honest Seth was. You could see in his face how much he really hates Punk. You can also tell WWE got Punk by the balls because his promos just aren't hitting like they should.
Yeah CM Punk is back but how weird is it that we got The Rock John Cena Randy Orton & CM Punk on SmackDown in 2023
It’s crazy cuz he beat Seth years ago and Roman beat punk years ago and now Seth and Roman are the faces of wwe so I see why it’s hard for punk to choose
When it said burn it down I went ooooou this is a new era and it’s exiting thank you triple h
Shout out to my cuty. Louisville!
Watching this with a spliff hits diffrent ..i cant believe this
I have to think that this was definitely a dig at Hangman's promo in AEW. Seth just did it with more style
Can’t wait for Seth to GO TO SLEEP!
Is anyone tired of listening to this guy already. I am lol
Fragile Punk vs Injury Maker Seth Rollin.  Wrestlemania 40 Rehab
Excellent promo here 👏🏾
Seth Rollins is 1000% correct! Cm punk walked out and then comes back as if nothing has happened!
Look, people, we get it. You individuals dont like Punk. Meanwhile let wrestling fans enjoy this feud.
Rollins is a punk
Hope Punk wins this feud. Rollins is like nails on a chalkboard to me at this point
This is so much better than Adam Page promo lol can’t wait for this match!
Rollins's time is up
Seth Rollins is really good!!!
WWE is a well oiled machine
Well we know who the next world heavyweight champion is lol
Who else thinks that CM Punk is going to win the Royal Rumble now?
🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
Intense....!!
CM Punk should bring his Real World Championship with him to the Wwe 🔥
What a war this is gonna be!
I like how each is a face in their own right. Punk could be seen as a heel but he really isn't. Neither is Rollins
Seth Rollins sounded like Hangman Adam page… lol how did that end up lmao😂.
Seth promo sound very familiar lol .
This is going to be the feud of 2024, HANDS DOWN! Amazing segment from both guys!
Crazy how Punk still hasnt wrestled. Just keep wasting everyones time week after week.
Even the fans don’t know who to cheer for😂
That’s the Seth Rollins we need. He is better as a heel cause he’s not going to get cheered more than CM punk and Cody Rhodes.
Disgruntled younger brother that’s what Seth sounds like…. He’s right tho
Now THIS is a feud to remember!
Could have sworn we saw a promo like this during Punk's feud with Hangman in All Friends Wrestling.
Here we go ladies and gents the rivalry as old as time is back
Why did they cut the part when he said “are you done? That’s the last time ur gonna talk to me like that”  Punk too spicy for Seth YouTube gotta cut it
I had a feeling Punk was going to go sign with Raw because Smackdown can't have Randy Orton and CM Punk  needed to be even out.
So many great candidates to win the men's rumble match! This rumble should be one of the best!........ I hope 🙏 🤞
This fued is gonna be awesome
punk needs his slick back back
Joker vs joker
Why did Seth freaking Rollins come out there looking like barney
CM Punk enter the royal rumble hope he don't walk out like back in 2014 when he didn't win.
I knew this was going to happen sooner or later 😂
CM has been
i don’t get it soooo who is reigns facing at maina anybody anybody please not rhodes again i hope some way we get the rock
Nobody in the WWE now can talk like this guy.
CM Punk is something like the worst nightmare that I hate so much
Story time with Punk is sooooo boring..
Welcome to Cleveland
I feel like a 18 yr old again
Every time I see Punk, I think I'm still sleeping.
Rollins has a point!!! I think CM Punk has his hands full!!!!
Why do these two hate each other?
If it weren’t for Punk Rollins,Roman and Moxley wouldn’t be the stars they are now 💯💯💯
Seeing CM Punk in a spicey good mood makes me feel all warm and fuzzy in my tum tum.  Let's hope he keeps smiling.
Ain't no cm punk anymore it's cm sellout
This is hilarious. It’s the Hangman Adam Page promo WWE Style 🤣
CM Punk and Wade Barret Could Form a New Nexus
They are going to trick everyone when he wins the rumble. He will go after Roman instead.
That's right never look back on the past it was just a lesson 💯
Punk is so overrated it's not funny i don't know why everyone likes this woke waste
Team punk team rko 😅🎉
And it begins
Great watch this tonight...❤️🤍🖤🤣🤣🤣🤟🏻
I dont think the crowd knew how to react lol... like do we cheer or boo 🤔
More like seth confronts punk 😂
Seth hit him with that Hangman line 🔥
This feud is going to be great 👍 👌
Please don't use this matchup at RR, this screams WrestleMania night one main event    Edit: Just finished the video so nevermind 😂
I need a brawl and curse words at some point 😅 your not the only one who's been betrayed
In that crowd No one is old enough to remember his early stint lol
The back to back promo shots for this would be crazy once wrestlemania season comes 😭
The title hurts so much.
Wow amazing performance by Seth congrats on crushing and destroying for the win tonight. He totally deserved the beatdown and you definitely deserved the win tonight.
We need the Heel Punk
Wow, he said wrestling and not sports entertainment
I really can't believe that CMPunk is back in the WWE he is gonna be WWE World HEAVYWEIGHT Champion sooner then Later Seth Rollins you are living on borrowed time you are gonna lose that title
Why is the crowd so quiet always
The long stare down was 🥶 blooded tho,But CM Punk put Seth  Rollins on noticed tho.
Cm punk is not going to just show up and become champion. Rollins such a far more superior wrestler than punk will ever be . 💯
He's only here because his wallet is empty. That's the only reason why he's back
Seth Rollins vs. CM Punk at WrestleMania 40 💯🔥
Heel turn for rollins now?
Imagine Punk wins against Rollins and then Priest cashes in
🔥🔥🔥🔥segment
Shirt purchased!
RAW!!!!!!!!!!
Yep
Long term story telling at its best
Still doesn't feel real that Punk is back in the WWE
W
