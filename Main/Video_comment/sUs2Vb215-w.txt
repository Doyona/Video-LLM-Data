The Last Xbox Limited Edition Console ever.
I just bought this Halo Infinite Xbox Series X for 300 euro’s from someone that said it was turning off after 2 hours of gaming. I opened up the console, replaced the thermal paste and it’s still working after more than 2 hours. Got so much luck with this find.
7/21/25 Here: these 3 year old Covid Era comments are hilarious. They really used to sell out in seconds 😂😂. Now they resell on FB marketplace for as low as $200. 😅
Its a debt. For spoiling. They owe me consoles, monitors, a bedroom. Phones.
Fix MCC and infinite then sell this
Not worth 1k$
I tried so hard to get this Xbox should send me one
Finally got one for 440£ boxed and with all original items, happy!
❤️❤️❤️💪💪💪💪
I wanted one but I only found the regular Series X so I have that
Do they still make this edition?
Let’s get straight to it. 😤
😮❤
Time flies when you're having fun😢     I absolutely love this console
Ich hab sie❤❤❤
Awesome 🎉❤😅
2 years😢
don't sweat onit
Finally got one for 450€
Please make more, or give us another special edition
I need one!!!!!
Just bought one off of eBay.  Getting ready to play Starfield!
The best Xbox Series X edition yet! I’ve been enjoying each & every game on this. Halo was the first video game I played as well so thank you Xbox for giving me such an incredible childhood!
c'est une console épic que PERSONNE sauf les commerçant qui les ont TOUTE acheter pour pouvoir les vendre 2,3 voir 4 fois le prix super le commerce en 2023 on va aller loin !!!!
when will it restock or what?
Pre order took forever!
We waiting for Xbox series S" Halo Infinite edition" 💪🏻
Glad I 😅got this 💰 $1100 it worth ever penny
4 hours from now this trailer turns 1 year old
How many of these were made? Why won't you tell us Microsoft?
It was out of stock the moment they clicked upload
I’m happy and proud to say that I was able to preorder this and get it on November 15th. It looks beautiful!
Xbox Series X - Halo Infinite Limited Edition Bundle
I got it in store at micro center retail price 550$ 😍 shhhh
Why I can’t find the Xbox series x anywhere they are out of stock
I love it^_^
Are you going to be making more? Scalpers are reselling them at ridiculous prices
I can't understand why it's so difficult for Microsoft to provide information regarding whether there will be any future restocks or not!
Just got my hands on one can’t wait
We're all finishing this fight
See you on December spartans you need
@XBOX Any chance theres one more console left for someone who will actually appreciate it? 😉
What are the in game add ons with this console?
I GOT IT!!!!!
❤
I can’t believe I own this now
Stood in line for 6 hours at best buy in 32 degree weather for one. Worth it.
This looks even more beautiful in person
Shipped yesterday woot woot. Now I have the Reach Xbox 360 and this one
Ordered one yesterday i‘m so excited to unbox this beauty
I was an 1 hour late and I missed it
This better get back in stock soon
They weren't even limited edition, they simply never existed.
Whenever I see the out of stock thing I wonder: was there any stock in the first place.
More like can't and won't get it edition
Reeeeeeeeee 😤❤️
This theme song gives me crazy, I gonna wait to playing
Microsoft announces something Scalpers: AAAAAND IT’S GONE
I got charged for mine today I am so happy I was able to get 1! I am so sorry to everyone who wasn't able to get 1 due to the ridiculous scalping situation :(
The release date has changed?? 25th Nov?? Or as it was 15th?? Please tell me
Managed to get one for 50%+ RRP, not sure if I should be happy or not 😅
And series S?
Why pre-order online stop selling online and release it to stores because of scalpers like yall winning because of scalpers. Pls limit 1 per person/ in stores not online, jesus crist to slow down scalpers. Yall dont care about xbox fans only for scalpers look I wanted mini fridge and gone 3 minutes this shows proof why you xbox dont care/Bill gates.
I can't wait to get mine I hope Gamestop restocks the Halo Infinite Elite Controller
The best console yet! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This month BABY
It would be nice if Microsoft did an official unbox of this console, showing it side-by-side with the regular Series X. It's a bit difficult to know which one I would prefer under normal lighting conditions (especially the light grey sections), just in case I'd get the opportunity to buy one!
Will I ever be able to get one of these?
If only there was stock…
I sold 2 of these for 850 each. The 3rd one I kept for myself :) its so beautiful
I hope you can buy the controller separate
Had to buy from eBay….. Finally got one though! So excited. Microsoft needs to better handle preorders.
Dam looks good.
Nice, but Halo5 on PC when?😁
Oh, that's beautiful!
Jus pre ordered mine 🔥
xbox alıcaktım ama baktım ki ps5 le arasında grafiksel fark yok gittim ps5 aldım microsoft 12 teraflops değilde 20 teraflops donanım ile gelseydi direk series x alırdım
Дайте два.
Yoooii
Microsoft could be making way more money but all these scalpers probably gonna be making more
Ah, this console, it's making me loose interest in the franchise. You can't even sell it to your actual halo fans and make it easy for scalpers to buy it. Let us preorder it from our live accounts and make them to order. I'd wait 6 months for it.
Успел сегодня
AAAAND IT’S GONE!!
Представители #microsoftxbox дайте отчет предзаказов в россии!! Что то ваших предзаказов Мвидео\эльдорадо не было вообще, dns - какая то кошачья залупа которая сбросы происходили, ozon отключил доставку на предзаказ , заказать было не возможно но теперь цену сделал 59тыс!!!
Just preordered this today, can’t wait for it 😁😁😁
The scalpers are going to have so much fun with their new xboxes!
BEAUTIFUL 👌🏻👍🏻👌🏻👍🏻
So beautifule, I hope I will catch it .
Scalpers are rubbing their hands rn
I have already preorder it im very hhappy 😱😱
😱OMG!!!😱
Amazing
Scalpers got the lot :(
That's sicks I wonder if when you turn it on it has the halo theme song that would make me buy it😂
Seen some crazy prices for one of these!!!🙈
Next month baby!
does anybody know if this console has special sounds for on/off (like the other limited bundles did)?
The specialty of all custom consoles!
Scalpers: All your xbox are belong to us.
U mean the xbox halo mythical edition
OUT OF STOCK
Le jeu le plus attendu sur la console, l'édition la plus attendu de la console et le stock est partie sur Ebay
I can’t wait to see this on eBay selling for $3000
Shame series x hasn't been in stock anywhere in 3 months
Lmao….good luck getting this
Gamer bar
Just pre-ordered this, I'mma sell it for $800 ez money
If I had the money, I would definitely get this. Probably sold out by now though.
That’s cute, but will anyone be able to buy it? 😕
They're selling stuff that's already out of stock.....
I kinda wish the armour wasn't on the console.. and it was just the stars/sky. Imagine how minimal and amazing that would look.
I love it. One day itll be mine.
Hopefully mine getting delivered nov.14th :-)
Another artificially scarce product I should just forget about since it won’t be available.
I was able to Pre-Order 2 from Walmart on September 23 2021!! Who else got one?
Aaand its sold out 🤦 only available at your local scalper for $2500
It’s prolly like 2k
Thanks for the pre-order Wal-Mart.
That took lots of clicking. Thanks Wal-Mart
I got one last night boys!!!
Wow looks🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don't care about Halo but this looks nice
I was able to preorder 2 today! one for me and one for my gf
I've never seen it sold in Japan.
Super!🍀🏆💓*
Kratos voice vs Master Chiefs voice?
Где консоли в РОССИИ????? МЫ УЖЕ УСТАЛИ ЖДАТЬ!!!!!
Be nice if I could get one of the new consoles at all
Where can I find on the regular one ? Lol it won’t even let me pre order this
Man got this but can't find one Xbox series X anywhere... Lol this will be $2k on eBay
they put the master chief on the xbox!
Stores are advertising but as soon you go online its already out of stock🤣🤣😍
I would love to know where I can buy any series X
Microsoft could do something about scalpers, but chooses not to because it's better for their bottom line.
I see they are continuing the Scalper Edition Xbox. Literally selling for twice the msrp. Great job Microsoft. . .
Bruh would have gotten this one instead of the one that released immediately
At this time bots have one I'm sorry, my brothers and sisters it was sold out in one day
Looking nice!🔥🔥🔥
Who cares already been scalp
Scalper magnet edition
Prepare to pay more than $1000 for this console,  Microsoft you guys are really amazing, I really don't understand all the companies who do nothing to battle scalpers, I mean like are you comfortable earning less money from your product than someone who does nothing but just resend the package?
X box series x scalper edition
aaaaaaaand it's gone
Well, Limited Edition says everything.
Please bring back more into stock I wanted to buy one just couldn't since they were out of stock
Pre order now, or never, or nah, nvm.
Can i buy the Controler only?
Xbox series Y and Z out 2024
Two words….     Doo…Doo
Lmao limited edition my 🍑. I can even by the new XBOX or the PS5.
Too bad bots are the only ones that can get it
If I could buy an xbox I'd get this
Isn't that false advertisement, how do you pre order something that cant be pre ordered
Pre orders flipping like hot cakes rn
They could have just called this bundle the 'Manliness package'
Yeah Xbox are you releasing these things to scalpers on purpose because actual gamers should be your priority. Whatever gets you your money I guess.
Ebay scalper: "$34,000 plus $500 for shipping and handling."
I want this
0:44 se sintió como si halo estuviera reviviendo, como si hubiera visto todos los halos crearse desde el ce hasta el wars 2
Alguien en español??
I was waiting to get the new Xbox series X cuz I knew they would make this one but the pre orders are already sold out, truly sad honestly, I have the Halo 3 and Reach Xbox 360 and this would’ve looked so nice next to them 😔
I almost feel bad that I was able to buy this to replace my "regular" Series X.
Should be called "Game not finished edition"
Still pissed they didn't do ANYTHING to slow scalpers. Thanks from you loyal fans, Xbox.
I finally got it secured myself 🤩
"Out Of Stock''
If  people aren’t getting Xbox series x to spend money on games that means game publishers are making any  money that means lass game would be released in the futures
I love it! Ordered one and will make my year getting this limited edition halo console I have the Xbox one version and that’s impressive so this Xbox series x will be mind blowing
Yessir
When the series X all digital?
I’d sell my soul for one
Was so sad to see this go out of stock in less then 5 seconds, could not even buy one.
shame it will be obsolete when the sleeker consoles get released, not that it looks that good anyway...
이놈들아 팔기나해 사러가도 살수가 없어
Why don’t you focus on making standard editions?
Les mecs qui les achètent pour se fair un bénéfice allez vous fair foutre
Dont buy on ebay. There will be more series x halo editions available on 15th november at the ms store.
it always starts with the limited editions and collectables, then followed by disappointment. just look at how cyberpunk turned out.
Im gonna get 3 and selk for double price!!!
And it’s already scalped
I have 25 of em up on my eBay story if anyone needs one!!!
Be nice if I could get 1.
Annnnnddddd it's gone
series x "scalpers edition"
Xbox series x even harder to get edition
Wtf did they only make 1 per retailer?
Wait was anyone actually able to preorder one though 😂
Can’t even get my hands on the normal version…… wtf makes you have the audacity.
omg
They gotta start selling in stores and not just online
Scapular‘s already ruining it
Microsoft: "limited edition" Me: "so the regular Xbox series X?"

More like “🦄 Edition”
Halo infinite bouta go baw baw baw brrrrrr
Where can I find one ?
Keep watching this video. Can’t wait to receive this bad boy!
All ready up on ebay for 1500 😵😵
Microsoft needs to step up and fix what they let happened  losing faith in Xbox
I will never see this in real life. Only in pictures…and eBay!
throws money at screen
Yes Spartan 117 we need you to stop the end of the Xbox famine.
When will we see the Xbox Series X Scalper Edition? It’s a Series X covered in dollar signs and eBay logos. When you turn it on, it makes the noise that the eBay app makes when someone bids on one of your auctions.
Top!!
Ok sounds good #halo
amazing
“ Halo infinite Limited Scalper Edition Bundle”
Llebate todo mi dinero
Enjoy scalpers XD.
Infinite limited
and its sold out
First start by making the original
PS5 FTW
I can’t order it!! Out of stock (Italy ) WTF!!
Sad you still can’t find them
More like Not Available Edition, Xbox you really gotta do something about these scalpers. Actual people who want to spend money on this can't even buy it. But then again they're still getting money so then don't care. 💀
So these will be in stock about year 2025 then?
😡😤🤬yejiabbdvnrkeuattahfitijehafzbmgijrhd .....gggrrrrrrrrrrr...hwhidifbdnsk....ok I'm ok now, just had to let that out, back to my Xbox one X 😅
Hooray! Another xbox series x I cant get!

Callesenen ey tototoomen mi dionerrooooo locoooo
Lindo de mais ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Microsoft can barely keep the regular version of the console in stock. I cannot imagine the Limited Edition being available at all.
And i'm like just stuck with base xbox one 😭
Should of called it "The Scalpers Edition"
Oh man the music,l😭😭
Quelle beauté, elle est incroyable vraiment.
Annnnnd ITS GONE!
Can't believe I was able to pre order one for my lil bro

Amazing!
#nextgenruined
I thought that the Grey Halo controller that it comes with was an even more limited edition Halo Elite controller, needles to say I was very disappointed to find out that it was not.
Xbox Series X Scalper Edition
Aaaaand it's gone.
Looks like I’ll get to play this December 2023 😫😫😫
I FINALLY GOT ONE YAYY YAYY I HAVE EVERY SINGLE HALO EDITION CONSOLE EVERRR! THIS LOOKS THE BEST TO ME!
I try to pre order and it says out of stuck.
Currently dying in my seat
It would be good to actually get one for the normal price and not 5x higher
Out of stock LMAO 🤦🏽
"Pre-order now from participating scalpers while supplies last", there fixed it for you lol
That looks amazing
Someone in North Korea will get one before I do
"sold out everywhere" went to my local game to find that they had numerous consoles remaining for pre order?! Yup I got one 😊
20💚
Beautiful
Wow..!!! Another Edition i can't buy ;)
https://youtu.be/UbvxNepnSIw

Wondering if I’ll even get the chance to play this game on the new console sheesh 🙄 😒
IF XBOX REALLY LOVED US THEY WOULD HELP STOP THE SCALPERS.
Microsoft teams: ok team we gonna go ahead and start making halo edition Xbo-  Halo infinite edition: sold out*
Necesito 🥲
To the scalpers they go...
Should be called “Buy me for 1500 dollars because scalpers will run bots on my website.”
Yeah the scalpers already got them all
Can not compare to halo 3 limited edition console
Me who needs this in my life but already has the series x 👁👄👁
0:24 0:44
This gives me chills
Where's the gold "20" emblem on the console from the vid? I've checked all the photos of the console on the xbox site and can't see it lol
Ahh microsoft you wanna slide me one of those for free?
So sick of stuff like this being released and they only make like 100 of them, they're just missing out on more money
Pre ordered 👍🏻
هالو تاىهعغلالعغلرعغهالثعهسخابصىخهثتبصخبتخشسهعاتصهثعباثهعبلثصعبثصهابهصشعث7غثصبثصفلثلبغثصعشه

Does it have laser engraving?
And it’s gone
Anyone else think they make chief talk too much now?
I was lucky enough to pre order still cant wait to get my hands on it and halo infinite
Ima hope this ends up on store shelves when it releases
Any performance upgrades from original series x?
More like: scalper edition
'Limited Edition' Yeah cause its not like we're short of standard Xbox Series Xs.
I managed to get mine! Can't wait
And its gone
Pure unobtainium
More like mythic edition  since nobody can get the regular one 🙄
Rip I’ll never get one
งามอีกแล้ว
😑, what about me though. I already got one
Look guys! We're making an Xbox for more scalping! It looks great btw!!
Intercessor
Should just make an eBay edition.
Scalped
I like the original one more
Как же она круто выглядит то)
Its gonna be never ending if they keep coming out with themed consoles there gonna be on wave 5 and were still cant get the base console tfo
Microsoft dont care if their scalped as long as they sell them
Xbox Series X - Limited Out of Stock Edition Xbox Series X Halo - Only in your Dreams Edition
oh look, another thing for scalpers to monopolize :/
343 should have hired this guy to put Cortana on the console https://youtu.be/fggE3VI3NRg
Can't wait to not be able to buy this!
Can’t wait to see this on stock X for $2,000
I’m honestly so lucky.
I’ve got one :)
I’m so happy i manage to pre order one
Can't wait to get mini fridge
Microsoft: pre-order the Halo Infinite Limited Edition console right now!!  Also Microsoft: NOT IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS!
They only built like 20 xboxes 🥲
I can’t find the normal X, let alone this.. 😂
Gorgeous
Omg 😍
Xbox Series “Out of stock”
Microsoft : "...while supplies last" *Scalpers : aight bet!!*
probs sell out before it releases
How the hell do scalpers already have these lined up for sale
I preordered one! Lets gooooooo
Heres an idea Microsoft: RELEASE IN PHYSICAL STORES
They're already sold out, scalping needs to be made illegal
🦾🔥 the best console and powerful in the world thanks Microsoft 😻
OHH so the limit Edison will be available November 15th right just to be really sure?
Tomara que venha pro Brasil
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY 🤜💰🎮
I have not clicked this fast in any video. Ever!
WHAT ALL HALO DIE HARDS WANT BUT WONT BE ABLE TO GET. THE TRAILER!!!
Making limited edition console bundles and consumers can't even get their hands on regular editions. Seems about right smh
That does look sick.
I’ve been trying to pre order but can’t?
Show, the best.
Does anyone know when preorders go up in Australia? Because I can’t find anything allowing me to preorder
You can't even buy this.
Aren't all Xbox Series X's limited edition?
If you live in the UK like me go you’re local GAME store and pre order one to the store I did as the online stock GAME had sold out fast same with everywhere else but the stores have limited orders they can do but you should still be able to get one for the original price if you want it instead of shedding lots on resale
I managed to score one! Now to keep this or my normal Series X?
Atleast now that there another version of the series x it will make it easier to get one
I cant buy one MR.MS Scalper bought them all.
I got mine preordered yall buncha plugs
It’s beautiful 😍
I bet they only made the one that was in the trailer.
While I really want MS to take my money, but they just don't do it.
top 1000%
All gaming products are officially being advertised only for scalpers.
Already being scalped on eBay
Hola
Scalpers can you step away pls? Xbox running for the top!
Proof that I should of waited
UwU UwU UwU
I cried😂😂💀
I have the regular series x but I’m still gonna buy one of these because why the hell not
It would be nice if all the bots/scalpers didn't already scoop them all up.
Scalpers just creamed their pants
I FINALLY GOT IT OMG
I’m applying at Walmart, target , Best Buy  just for this
One X Gears. One X Gears. One X Gears....
OK 👍 And... One X Gears?
And it will cost you.... your kidney. (Have not checked actual cost yet)
Scalpers be like ……. Nope
Guys at this point just wait for the next generation of consoles
Scalpers like 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Since consoles wont be in stores guess im done gaming after one x scalpers can have them and xbox can be happy for sales although the consoles aren't in gamers hands
I thought goosebumps were designed for you to look bigger while fighting off another primate/animal. Evolution now does that during console reveals too.
Much interested in the game
Got mine YEAH BABY !!!!!
Sorry but I love halo and that looks whack. Should have been spartan green
😂
I have one for sale as my partner pre ordered me one for Christmas but she forgot I was massive Halo geek and already pre-ordered myself lol. If you are interested get in touch! I want it to go to someone who deserves it
nice
I need to stop buying consoles on release 😩
Omg wow
WOOOOHOOOOO got my Pre Order thank goodness missed the last one because of scalpers and i have FH5 on pre order too 😎👍😁
WHOOOOOOOO
I havent bought one but this the ONE
*Music in the video*   Youtube: [MUSIC]
WHATS THE INTERNAL MEMORY❓
Nice console.Sadly I won't have the money to buy it in the next 1 year.I hope there will be some other limited edition console then.
🗣📢NUT
Cant Buy it!!!! THX Microsoft to give all your XBOX to the SCALPERS!!!!
If it makes Halo noises like the Reach edition 360 did, I'm in
Just went to my local gamestop and got it 💪🏾
Look nice but hear problem why cost more Xbox one series and just skin color
Microsoft, allow us to purchase through our Console: 1 per customer, to stop Scalpers.  Or, just ship them directly to stores.
Another product that will be found in resale markets day one.
Sure let me pre order my ANNND ITS GONE!!!
Beautiful! I’m the proud owner of an Xbox Series S, but one day I’ll have to bag me one of these!
I was at PayPal Checkout and the the Sold out apperead :(
Sold out in seconds
And it’s sold out within minutes. Man these times we’re living in sure do suck :/
I can’t wait for an unboxing video next
Im not even able to get the 'normal' Xbox Series X and do you really spect me to get that ultra super limited edition? C'mom Microsoft why did you do this to me? 😢🤤
Sickest looking console in the history of gaming.  WOW!
20 years.  Man we’re old.
Increase the RRP and let market forces sort this mess out!
READ 1:10  WHILE SUPPLIES LAST CRY ABOUT IT! LOL!!!
Buenisima la edicion pero con el juego me conformo 😂 la pobreza ...
0:20 I thought we were getting Halo 3 Anniversary :(
Lol merry Christmas to all the scalpers out there😂 and to all the fools who pay $1,000 we'll be praying for your stupid brain!!
Walk us through how we can get this. It's OK, I'll wait...
Fingers crossed for another stimuls 🤞🤞😂
Glad I could get one before they went out of stock..
Ima wait till 2023 before buying one.
awesome, another console for scalpers
Anyone know if bestbuy will have these as preorder or just sell them when they release?
Scalpers got mostly all of them
Flex
STOP SELLING THESE TO SCALPERS XBOX!!!!!!
Cheif what are you doing??  Sir killing the scalpers sir Can we send cheif door to door decking scalpers and delivering these consoles to gamers???
I'm done with Xbox after this launch.  I feel like all new consoles launches are gonna be like this.
Microsoft helping scalpers line their pockets for the holidays. How kind.
Take my money!!! :3
This should’ve went to GameStop exclusively
Too bad that Microsoft don't care about us and allowed scalpers to buy them all up. I really wanted one too. Thanks Xbox this generation of consoles been disappointing.
"Aaaand its gone"
Cant even preorder that xbox
"Master Chief, mind telling me what you are doing on that console?"  "Sir, finishing these scalpers"
Sold out :(
Going to buy 40 at least 🤟🖕🤟
please let this be available in Asia i promise ill skip PS5 Fat and wait for PS5 Slim. 😍
Scalped it lol.
Lmao they are already sold out on preorders 💀💀
You're going to see this on electronic bay and Amazon for $2,000 sold by those wonderful scalper losers
What about the series S?
Your joking right…
That’s a dam good looking console, Shame you won’t be able to buy one
Otro halo?😴😴😴😴
I can’t wait to pre… Oh wait.
Yes yes YES!!!!!!!
I WANT IT NOOOOOW!!!
Would have been nice to pre-order one if not for the scalpers grabbing them up in less than 30 minutes
I need this music
The game not even out yet though...
We’re never be able to upgrade, because devs know old consoles outnumbers the people that do own the new consoles, so the gaming industry will always make games for old consoles, im good with that.I don’t much care for graphics or fast turn on or quick resume, consoles people just buy s pc and an xbox controller
I’m so glad I was able to grab this and the controller through Game Uk
Wish I could actually pre order!!!!
I LOVE ITTTT
You cant even get on the list for preorders, why even advertise?
I got one and the limited Elite Controller too🥳😍
Why even bother to tell us scalpers are gonna get it I haven’t even gotten the series x yet
Xbox out here feeding the scalpers again
Microsoft why even advertise this. If you care about your fans make enough consoles for the actual fans to buy them.
Delivery ob 2025
Sheeeeesh
Were csn I perolder gamestop are not taking any  Preorder
great video to bad you won t see it available lol
PL -> Eicko to wygląda. ENG -> It looks epic. 🤩
HOW THE HELL DO YOU EXPECT POEPLE TO PREODER THIS WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN GET THE REGULAR SERIES X
Lol cant wait to not see them not release more and let scalpers control another market
XseX
Thanks for the shadow drop while I was at work… Now I’ll never get one
Got mine yaya
I can smell the scalpers from here
I hope the Scalper offers on ebay will be deleted soon!!!
Why! Scalpers have them all. Won't matter!
Scalpers have cleared the pre orders Microsoft…. What are going to do about it ! 😡
Infinite but not really xd
Scalped already 😂 nice job Microsoft👍
Console lindo pra kralho
Man I'm so hyped for the game that I immediately went to pre-order the console, except there were none! I'm so excited that I didn't get to pre-order one; so much so, that I cancelled my copy of Halo infinite. Yay!!
And it's already sold out.
Bought my ore order this morning! Woohoo, something to look forward to!
Haha you guys still sell these? Thought the scalpers bought y'all out already
Why are they afraid to show gameplay...
And it's gone!
yet more hardware they wont be able to provide.  Fun times...
They’re on eBay already
Welcome, we are announcing the xbox series x halo limite... and theyre gone.
Ebay exclusive?
Just pre ordered mine. Roll on December.
scalpers? you can only buy one system per account so I don't think scalpers would buy this. Offcourse you got normal people to buy this and sell.
About time for pop up Microsoft stores to hit the streets, get people away from this ‘passive income’ BS*** bring back the fun of the winter holiday period, standing in line with other gamers was fun, meeting people at ‘crazy o’clock’ people actually invested in an experience. I can’t help but think that the scalpers are actually players who rage 😡 quit during matches, desperately trying to get revenge. 😂
Halo Infinite Xbox Series X: Scalper Edition
Introducing the legendary thanks to scalper out stock edition.
YES I WAS ABLE TO GET ONE!!!!
Take my money
Scalpers going to sell this minimum $1000-$1500
They already on ebay for thousands
These sold out in like 5 minutes
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Xbox releases new Xbox  Scalpers: I'll take your entire stock
Always commercials for nothing! 👎💩
Just announced for pre-order Already sold out due to scalpers…..
scalpers already done bought em all
Might as well sell these to scalpers themselves since they don't want to stop them
Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.
Im going to pre order  it Now
So let's find where the scalpers live and rob them
The music ❤️
Thought the original black one was limited edition cause you can't find one
halo 2.0 без русской озвучки
November 15 ...sounds familar             Plz don't fk this up 343 have my hopes on u guys..
SCALPERS: INFINITE
We need more SSD internal storage!!!!!
game play pls
Omg!!!
@majin 👀
Very tempting to have.
If you could sell that controller to me separately, that would be quite nice.
its annoying how they make so few, I cant even get one man. Disappointed
Would be nice if the sites weren't botted and I could actually get one -_-
When are they going to make reselling illegal?
Omg just got one pre ordered at GAME   out of stock unless buy with a t shirt or hat!
I'm sooooo thankful to get my hands on this
to late i have already the normal version q,q
Preview of things you can't own on game systems you can't buy.  Bah ha ha ha.
That's nice
Sold out in seconds.... I really wish Microsoft would figure out how to sell to regular consumers without scalpers buying all of these units.
My bank account will be pissed
Oh, it’s beautiful.
You are telling me to pre order this ? When I can’t even get my hands on the regular version smh mission impossible….
Got the point to place the order and already gone ffs. Microsoft really need to change how they go to market. Only people that can buy are those that want to resell  straightway for double.
scalpers already have them all preordered and ready to sell for the low price of $1800
Seriously???? 😂😂😂😂
I've looked for eight hours just to go on ebay and see the cheapest listing as 1300... oh why scalpers???
Aaand they're gone. I can buy someone's preorder on Ebay for 1300 bucks already. How wonderful.
Dont like 😢😢😢
I want one so fookin' bad
Can’t believe I got one so happy about that ✌🏻
I got chills when I saw this!
Can’t wait to see me lose the chance of getting one because of scalpers
$50 deposited.
Status: Out of Stock
"HeRe I aM, sCaLpErS."
Beautiful.  Now can I trade in my bland Series X for that one?
It’ll be nice never seeing any of these because of the shortage
I swear, I will get one of these at all costs,
I NEED IT
looks good MS but it will be like 5 of them max.... on ebay for 5 times the price
Que música!!!!
And its sold out
My Mind: Shut up and take my money  My Wallet: Im ready Brother The Xbox Halo Edition: …and Im sold out
I JUST GOT THE SERIES X!!!!!!!!   I COULDVE WAITED!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah ok, nice job Xbox for keeping scalpers in business. Shows how much you really care about your loyal players, nice job thinking this one through, again 🙄
It’s so pretty why did you announce this while I was at work I want one :((
Bellissima. .la voglio ...xbox  se in Italia fate girare una pubblicità  così in tv  fareste il botto.😉
Beautiful. If I didn’t have my XSX yet, I’d definitely buy this one
Change the song to: "It's not there!"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8LUxlzAoyA
All sold out.
E3 2022 : In Stock!
I got one wooooooooooo
SOLD OUT - BEFORE THIS TRAILER WAS EVEN PUBLISHED.
How can it be "Infinite" if it's a "Limited" edition????
GÄNSEHAUT…
like any normal person will be able to get this
好吃
This was already sold out when you put this up
Finally the Xbox I've been waiting for
Shut up and take my money. I'll pay 800 rn
People already selling pre-order receipts for $1k.
and brothel stocks ?????
Ridiculous how they are sold out already..
Name of the music
Sexy af
Had my series x from launch and now got this pre-ordered for my son.  And peepz say they are hard to get. :)
So nice of MS to release this for the scalpers.
24 hours later and the pre-orders are sold out. :/
Just put stickers on my gaming laptop and it’ll still be better
If it's only xbox and controller skin then I won't but it. Ehehe
Lindíssimo!!!
gift me one please
*:0*
Xbox: I know what gamers like
Annnnd it’s gone..
All gone to scalpers and bots. Smh
Now I have 2 series x consoles in my house, suckers
I've been holding off forever for this and now it looks like I'll never get one unless they release more
scalper already got it. sweet
Microsoft rn: “how can we make more money off of people’s nostalgia”
And in Europe nobody can preorder it
Pre order now... After 1 second was already out of stock
Dont tell me that this thing sold out in like 5 min
There are you on sale on ebay 😂😂😂
Scalpers Edition
So…. sold out already?
Why dies the seris s exist why doesnt Microsoft hust make the x because surely they would make more money by seeling the seris x alone so there was more being made
This looks amazing
Limited edition? It basically never even was accessible. Frick off.
Wooowww!!!
Just saw this sold tf out love working night shifts lol
Its out of order -.- oh man...
Microsoft has to solve the scalping issue.
0:33 All my Halo memories from Halo: CE to the introduction to Infinite, the history of Xbox and Xbox Live, all flashed before my eyes.
Looks okay, could look better though.
Yeah, about that.... I'm gonna have to pass.
Xbox Scalpers Edition more like
Dayum that looks good
Это конечно всё круто, но где сама игра? Где геймплей? Где хоть то нибудь, где Хелблейд 2, где старые свиткки? Хватит кормить нас надеждами, давайте игры!
I love the look of these new halo controllers and consoles but I already have an elite series 2 and series x
Meh
Should of been off your website with requirements of an Xbox account for multiple years. At least then you could negate some of these scalpers. How about current Xbox live accounts
343 YOU BEAUTIFUL HUMANS I LOVE IT
Só espero que tenha pra vender .
Xbox has continued to completely botch this generation of consoles. We literally arent even going to be able to play these new games you bozos. We cant even get consoles. Ship them to stores and end online ordering.
Probably be able to get me hands on one by 40th anniversary
Looks like the scalpers are the only ones who won the fight after Master Chief said “finishing this fight.”
what about russian localization in psyhonauts2?
Already sold out😕
I guess I’m gonna be paying $1000 for this on eBay
@xbox:  Do the stars glow at night?
When the legend says we need to fight.
Im so glad i got one before it sold out
Meh 🤷‍♂️
all sold out
Already sold out.... Will I ever be able to get one before Infinite comes out? I doubt it....
I literally can’t find the console on any website apart from Microsoft and it’s sold out. Does anyone know where to look? I’m in the uk btw
I don’t know, but I’m disappointed! I was hoping they would take inspiration from the Green Halo 3 Xbox 360. This just reminds me on spaced themed Console, just check out the new Halo Infinite Elite Controller and you’ll see what I’m talking about
Microsoft: Only one console per person!!!! Scalpers: We don’t do that here
The game pass spoils us I love it :)
Wait...              i thought series x was limited edition
Stunning 🔥👌🏾
I'm annoyed because I had put my name down at various places to be told if/when this would be announced, so I could get one. Microsoft announces it, and sold out with in half an hour. I never got notified. So annoyed right now
I will be sure to preorder bid on eBay 🤔
Lies! 🖕🏼
Damit "sold" out everywhere!!!
Bought
“Just one question…what if you can’t get one of these consoles?”  “I won’t”
so great
You get the controller later as it's not ready yet kinda like the game....
You got my money lol!
Looks great  but I think the  halo infinite elite controller looks better  what  do you guys and gals think should the console have looked more like the elite controller .....
That's as beautiful as the music
Finally！
I wish it was easy to buy Xbox series x
Xbox doing what they do best. Releasing everything but games.
its beautiful!!!!
I missed it 😭😭😭😭
So hyped 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's beautiful ❤️
I am buying that
At least I know that the normal Xbox series X will be cheaper because scalpers would be focusing on the limited edition series X.
Time for Crystal Case Xbox ONE X
I want the full image of gold MC posing there
Yea!
I am poor😢
That gold image of MC that melts down.... WHY ISNT THAT ON THE SIDE OF THE XBOX ITS SICK
Anyone know the storage?
Should be called more: "Out Of Stock Edition"
I'll make now that my personal mission.  To get Xbox Series X Halo Infinite limited edition.
Fuuuuuuhhhh
i cant wait to get this console
Microsoft: "It's an Honor to bring all of you this gift in memory of Hal... Me: "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY" !!
Где купить такую цацу?
It would be nice if it came upgraded to 2tb
I will own me one of these... beautiful... just beautiful!
Not spartan green? Not interested
Thanks for showing us an awesome console that only 1% of people will get before the scalpers.
another thing we cant buy nice
I want one!
Sweet baby Jesus...
Ugh I wish it was just the controller
Yea nice gone in like 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.1 sec
Lol ok Microsoft you making me want to buy it
Sob I have one already.. 😐
You guys make me want to learn to code to figure out how to create my own bot JUST to get stuff "normally".
They better make it in person purchases to reduce scalpers.
Can you pre order in canada yet?
I just want the controller.
May I get on free by chance?
Bruh c'mon plz do something
You think they would've seen what Valve did with the Steam Deck preorders and did something like that to prevent rabbid scalping, but nope.  Shows how much they care.
I need it
I want to cry from the emotion
Se me hizo la piel de chino
I kid u not this thing sold out in 12 seconds
Already "sold out" smh
The scalpers 🥺
Hey guys. I’ll have one on eBay soon if anyone’s interested
coming soon with your favorite scalper
Includes 2000 bugs
I really belife that all of this Scalpers are working for or with Microsoft. From the standpoint of cheating all of us out of our money, it would really make sense.
“While supplies last”
I wish I had bits to buy me one smh
hahaha people are already selling the preorders on ebay for $900+ 4 months before release
air console🤬
And the scalpers already won…
wowowo omg epic
Meanwhile, I can't find available to buy even the standard version of the console...
Been waiting so long for this, now I’ll probably never get one tbh😔
HOW ARE WE EVEN GOING TO BUY IT YOU INCOMPETANT TOOLS?! I'll gladly drop several hundred on this I just want to be able to buy it before these scum of humanity poach it up with bots and scalp it...
Instant Pre Order
Been playing halo for 20 years Infinite looks 10 years old 😬
Y’all can’t even get the series x in stock
I will get it
Yo! I was able to pre-order and get one!!
Wrong step Microsoft
coming to ebay for 5k
I AM CRYING I AM SO EXCITED
would have been better if they gave us the elite controller instead
ITS SOLD OUT AS SOON AS IT WENT LIVE!!! HAHAHAHAAHA GOD BLESS THE #PCMR WITH THERE BOTS
they put the mamsnrhbr chehfde in the xbox
I gonna buy it next year! I won't give up!

Not gunna lie that's an amazing looking limited edition console 👍
Good
Xbox shut up and take my money!!!
i want this before i die :(
There going too make 2 of these so don't get ur hopes up lol
I want to pre-order so bad but I know it won't end well because of scalpers
I wonder how fast I'm going to see this on ebay for 5,000 dollars.
Please make more so I can buy one. Please
That's one good looking Xbox
It should have came with 2TB not 1TB.
straight FIRE
I did the 19K like
Orded.
YAY!! can’t wait for those to immediately go out of stock. Thanks Microsoft!
'Order Confirmed' 😁
BADASS! that's a sick lookin xbox. I love its for the 20th anniversary!❤
Sold out in less than 40 minutes online had it in my cart and got scalped BIG SURPRISE.
Snagged mine today for half off after redeeming MS Rewards points. Thank you, Xbox!!!
Xbox make the scalpers life easy as forever and when I really look like it I feel like they working with them too
Nailed it Good job Xbox 👌 I wish I could buy one......
As usual out of stock already
🤩🤩🤩🤩
How about xbox sends 1 email invite per gamertag so we can reply and buy one sheesh!!!
Limited editions like these should be sold exclusively by the microsoft store to allow for true fans to catch one instead of scalpers.
I need this in my life 💗
I wonder how much idiots will be willing to pay for this from scalpers?
Bro forget the console I need the music played here
The amount of money i spent on hardware this last year.. here we go again!
All the pre orders are already gone. Probably in the hands of scalpers
and sold out lol
sold out before you could even promote the thing. make more consoles and people will buy them MS.
And the special edition of Series S??
Soooo um what about the guys who got there’s on day one?? But want the special edition? 😅😅😅 @xbox
This was supposed to be the reveal for halo 3 anniversary
Just preordered baby
I tried adding it to the cart at least 20 times on Walmart and now it says it’s out of stock. Fml
Why its sold out in first hour
The thing looks good though
Best Looking Xbox Ever. Xbox kindly keep manufacturing up this exact console with original as well so that we can able to buy it
Just got this pre ordered cant wait!
Sold. Ill take 100 and sell them to scalpera
Beautiful
Scalpers' dream !
See, if you had this at YOUR event....YESTERDAY....I wouldn't have been at work, and missed this....now....fvcking scalpers got em all.
Wait. I thought xbox series x’s are gone.
Please Xbox, limit them to one console per person...
Mi opinión, my opinion. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DyADoyMsnxQ
Boy that toy looks spiffy!  These console skins keep getting better.
Good job more scalper fuel, great job guys really!
When can I preorder?
Will the controller possible be also sold separately. :)
Hopefully some stores have them in stoke and not online only
I want my mini fridge
Just copped from Walmart -1200 lmk🤣
Can't wait for these to go for $2,000 because Microsoft only decides to make 5,000 units
Can you make enough for normal people to get them though?!!!?
this ad has better graphics than the game
Pre-ordered!
Could've put green in there... somewhere. 🤷🙄
Hermosa!
I'm just trying to get the Standard Edition. Can we work on getting those in stores first!
"Get ready" for the scalpers
I’d just want an… edition.
생산이나 마이 해라!!! 지금 한국은 죄다 구엑박으로 한다... 이것들아!!!!
Meh.
Time flys...... when your havin fun.
Xbox please take my money
I want this...but I never will.
Now yall can't make me buy another series x
I just want the controller.
Will we be able to buy this in stores in person?
That’s probably gonna be like $800 just because it’s a Halo Master Chief limited edition
can't wait to not get one and instead just watch helplessly as they're scalped for two grand on ebay because they can't possibly make enough of them
I’m running out of money Microsoft!
Great looking console, too bad every retailer isnt saving any pre-orders for In-store only so scalper’s bots are just going to by out the stock before you can even click “add to cart” 🙃
Switched to pc after owning an Xbox since the 360. Life has never been better.
if nobody ever bought from scalpers then the scalpers would lose. Don't buy from scalpers! I'd rather not have the item than support those scumbags.
target has laptops in the Xbox display cases,, they also know nobody will get one this year
100% of the comments: *S C A L P E R S*
BOO!!!!
Listen scalpers I want this
If I get my hands on one of these (which I will) I’m selling it for 2k$, my bots are ready.
Bueno, pero si todas las Series X son actualmente edición limitada 🤔
Nice work Microsoft !!!!
The Xbox Series x scalpers limited edition
Page was bugged and it was instantly sold out when I got to check out. Great Job Microsoft!
Paint prices; Before Xbox: cheap After xbox: empty that wallet
OUT OF STOCK

Can't even get my hands on the normal one.... lol
Good luck getting one 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡

Awesome sauce, another system I'll never even see in real life!
just another idol.  sad.
you gotta be f!cking me I just got my series x 😀
I bet you like 10 actual fans that want it got it and the rest are now under scumbag scalper's control.
Master Chief vs. The Scalper Empire
when it’s cheaper to just get the regular series x and the game because of scalpers
It's out for stock in multiple stores already
Imma be looking through websites seeing this for like 2000$
Pain I have the regular this looks incredible
the piano gives me 2007 vibes
All consoles are limited editions these days.
Xbox limited edition çonsoles are back!  💚 the look!
Just nabbed one.
Ppl are already bidding on it at $2025!!!  Can't stand the f'n place!
And_it's_gone.gif
Already pre-ordered it, going to see my human friend soon
In latino  america???
I’ll stick with my series S till the X actually stays in stock
its probably sold out already
Aaaannndd we will never see it because of scalpers
And here’s where I’d put my Xbox Series X Halo Infinite Limited Edition. IF I HAD ONE!!!!shift+1!!!
I hope scalping becomes illegal before this drops
I'm so glad I got one!
I knew it was coming.
Does it play coop?
"While supplies last"
Ta potente 💗😎
Another version of the Xbox I have 0 chance of finding.
It's beautiful
Scalping this for 2k

Glad I didn’t buy the Regular version when I had the chance. This one I need.
Its the guys from splitgate
Se ve bien
Aaaaaaaaaaaaannnnddd.......it's gone! 🤣🤣🤣
😲Woooow💚so beautiful💚
Scalpers dream
Yay scalpers win again…
Bruh they are out again !!😂😩
posted 5 hours ago and i already cant get one.
When does the pre orders end?
Now that's tempting 🎉
Já vai ter mais consoles do que jogos, parabéns aos envolvidos 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🤣🤣🤣
Cant even get my hand on standard version thanks Microsoft gonna be even harder now
I was even online and spamming to get this... not 5 seconds after it went live it was sold out mid checkout. Gotta love it - gonna be first halo xbox I haven't gotten.
just preordered mine and the elite controller  to anyone who didnt get to preorder….shame suckers
Your console isn’t even available to buy….
Looks sick !!!!
Instead of this give us co op and forge at launch
Now I understand why it was delayed, just to make more money off it.
I GOT MINE!
Halofield Halofield Halofield Halofield
Imposible reservar en España.
THEY PUT DA MAMSTERCHIEF IN DA XBOSX! -Russian Badger and his friends probably
Can't believe I was able to pre order
Why did y’all only ship like 2 series X’s to New Zealand it’s been sold out for MONTHS!!
What makes this one more limited than the other
Ugh prepare for all the bots to rush to this!
It’s beautiful
Increíble! 😱🎮🤣
Cant wait to have this in 5 years❤
Design/engenering team have more respect for the Halo franchise than the 343
Scalpers selling 2g on ebay even though that illegal extortion
Can’t wait to not be able to find these either
December 8 the release date!!!
Microsoft you should of just sold all of these on your website. Take all the profit. Start it with dynamic pricing. Start the price at $1,500 and lower it every half hour. And it bottoms out at MSRP. Or just take pre orders and make that exact amount make the people happy not the scalpers happy.
I just bought mine off EBay for $5000
Woww just take my all my money 😍😍😍😍😍
The great journey ends here
Can we talk about how scalpers bought these out before this video was even put up. What the actual hell?
Aaaaand its gone. Thanks xbox. Yall should've tried the steam deck method instead letting all the scalpers have fun again
Tiddies.
Scalpers have ruined it again looking at eBay
And it’s gone….
That looks insane!!!
Lo necesito
Pra quem gosta de HALO parabéns. Já eu prefiro esperar uma do gears.
Stars ♥
Lol at the scalper gnashing of teeth.  I for one don’t care that people who are willing to pay more (not me mind you) will get their hands on one instead of you lot.
Already up on eBay for £1000
The regular series x are "limited edition". And now they release the "Myth Edition"
Time to buy it for 5000$
Already have the Xbox series x so....  *BUY THE HALO LIMITED EDITION* Well i now have 2  of them
Great now scalpers are going to sell these for $1000
And they’re sold out. Bummer. :(
(ONLY ON EBAY)
can't wait to not get one cause of the scalpers
Tbh I might buy this on my birthday(October 3) then sell my series s
Um wow impressive
While watching this video, my heart was pumping faster and faster, even skipping beats; ... until I read the comments about scalpers and my heart stopped beating.
I need one
How do they have the gaunt to make these ads and bundles when you can’t even buy them from retail? 💀
Ill get it 15 years down the road
Pre ordered the console and the elite controller 🙌🏻 roll on November 15th
isnt the normal series x and s already considered limited edition cause you cant find them anywhere💀👌
I wait for next year
Somehow got mine around 3 minutes after it went live on the Microsoft store today and  haven’t seen it since besides on eBay for outrageous prices. Everyone should get the chance to own one of these. Learn from the situation and limit one per household address, rest go to physical inventory in stores.
Why bother putting out the video when they all sold out before it was even posted?
Scalpers are going to by it out and sell for 2 grand
Wow bs first let us at least buy the regular first
If only we could actually buy these at retail.
When can we pre-order cause i'm trying 🤷‍♂️
Yay I’m so excited about waiting another 6 months for stock to be available
They should make it to where you can only buy these in store.
...... You know what.... I guess it wouldn't hurt to buy another series x lmao
Already on ebay for 1,500 rupies😪😪
I'ma nut
I want one ):
It's majestic
My buybots are ready!
if only it was actually possible to buy
Mother of god😶💚
add deeds politely
Scalpers <3 Microsoft
Anyone else looking for the regular one too?
Bruh i just got an xbox fml
I expect this one to be near impossible to find too
Tried my best to be faster than the scalpers
I love halo😍😍😍
I legit thought this was gonna be halo 3 anniversary at first
Sold out everywhere already nice job dropping the ball again
I can't even pre-order it, what hell
got mine
I love it. 💚💚💚
Not available in Colombia :3
Please make an Ice Blue version or Xbox Green?  Also fix your issue with scalpers WHAT THE HELLLLL
Straight from Xbox to EBay in 0.0001 seconds. Thanks Microsoft for nothing. Your fans really appreciate you putting scalper bots first. Thanks again. Just one of your loyal Xbox and Halo fans and supporters since 2001, guess that means nothing to you.
cant wait to play minecraft on this
Scalp the scalpers!
Of course these clowns announce this when I get mine
Can’t find the normal console in stores, but here! Try and preorder this one!
It honestly doesn’t even look that good,
Scalpers are going to have the best Christmas ever

Got one preordered for me and my wife. So excited for it
Great. Now how do I pre-order?
Sierra 117 > Spartan 117

Honestly I would just like the controller from this since I play PC.
How long will this be available for purchase?
Already sold out everywhere :'( --I just want an XSX
Oh great, lets see if Microsoft will do anything to prevent scalpers from preordering 10 of these as soon they’re available. Not like scalpers are bad for business or anything.
Managed to get one so happy 😀
Ughhhhh
Why does it show preorder when you can't?
I still really want one for my Collection... Must Have it so awesomely.
December 8? That's my birthday. Badass console skin btw.
Time to get another Xbox series X!
how would we be able to get this when we cant get our hands on the standard edition? still looks sick though!
Vive Halo
Already out of stock.. 😭
literally sold out within 2 minutes. just like my rtx card. wow.
IN CANADA 🇨🇦  ITS SOLD OUT FYI
Wonderful news for anyone who already has the console. Real nice...
How are they already gone
My Halo Reach 360 still looks better
And sold out..
It would be awesome if you guys didn't let scalpers and bots pre order all the stock.
Wait are they sold out already? I'm trying to buy one
When it’s out of stock does that mean it’s over? Or will they release more on November 15 to stores?
Amazing
I HAD IT IN MY CHECK OUT CART M Y CARD FAILED FMLLLLLLLLLLLL
Aaaaand its gone
GIVE
VERY BEAUTIFUL THIS FORERUNNER VISUAL
It's gonna be impossible to get one of these limited edition console. I'll just stick with my Alienware X17 gaming machine.

Ohhhh gift me that please i wish my first Xbox Console in my life
Im going to sell this for $1000
I can see it, now available on ebay for 3000

Scalpers  bots  Activited.
For $50 extra that’s a steal
Shut up and take my money!
Have fun actually trying to get one of these
Microsoft release it in person pleaseee I can’t handle these scalpers
I already got my xbox Series  S 😅
Y'all can't even produce enough regular editions.
This video was dropped two hours ago and they are already sold out. Get it together,  please,  💯
So beautiful 😍
This boutta be 2000 on eBay watch

Scalpers: great I can sell it for more than 10 times the price
There gonna be way more than 1000$ 3rd party sellers :(
😲❤️❤️❤️

Bruh they dont even have the regular ones
Niceeeeeee
@microsoft are you kidding me. It’s already sold out 🤬🤬🤬🤬

Refachera
Yay!! Another Xbox I won’t be able to buy because I refuse to pay scalpers.

they put de mamsbrhhbr chefde in de consl
And it’s sold out
THE SCALPERS ARE AT IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Already sold out. Lovely
@Xbox Cant wait to buy this from scalpers at 5x the value. Seriously are we getting any guarantee that we're getting this as soon as its available. Stop being silent about it and tell your fans that your going to do something about scalpers.
2 hours and the scalpers are already at it.
I would get this but I already got the normal series x
Lets just accept that the Series X won't be fully available for another 2 years..... if we're lucky.  The modern-day communistic breadlines are now video game hardware.  Who what of thunk.
Hope it comes with an anti-scalp system
Hard pass. The halo 360 looked much cooler than this.
PRE-ORDER NOW.. For £1000 on eBay.
600 usd
how can i get it?
Oh great another system the scalpers can get or people that already have one
And already out of stock
delayed*
Does anyone know when GameStop will have this for pre order because so far they don’t have any info??
ALREADY out of stock. thanks xbox for solving the scalpers problem!
The game companies plan this system shortage...   It happens every console generation,  they use it to keep demand high.
It’s so beautiful it’s almost like I won’t have one of these because I actually already have the normal series x
HALO INFINITE 20 Years Limited Edition Bundle, scalped on ebay, November 15 2021.
💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍💚💚💚
Bro, all Series X consoles are limited edition
Why bother calling this 'limited edition' - all Xbox Series X are limited edition right now.
And of course it's already out of stock
Just when I bought the old all black Xbox series x edition
OMFG! 😦
Sparten 117 scalpers can you hear me … (Scaplers: soooo $2000 fair offer right 🤣
And of course they sell out instantly what the hell.
And just like that the scalpers took them all
Just tried to pre order it, already gone.  Scalpers about to sell these for $2000
Hold up, so they were holding halo infinite just to release it on the 20th anniversary?
Scalpers right now: *hands rubbing*
This better not be sold out
OMG !!!!!!! 😍😍
Beautiful 🤩
What about the S version

Just pre-ordered mine!!!

But can it run forge and co-op?
Aaaand the bots are being prepped as we speak....
I had the chance to pre order it.. I Was curious to see if they where still available.. I’m looking the white one when it hits
Perfect
Aaaand it's out of stock
I hope they can only be purchased with the Xbox Live Ultimate subscription plan, to prevent scalpers from ordering them.
Was waiting online, I was only able to add to my cart before it was sold out....
There wont be limited edition if we dont stop the banished
And the game should arrive just in time for the 25th anniversary.

Take my money Microsoft 😱👋👈👅👻
this looks so sick, i feel like because ps5s are so much harder to change the look of, the new xbox can look so much better because of its plain design
Does anyone know if they will do another staggered release?
It’s actually going to sell for $2,000 for the limited edition. Oh they will be limited all right!

The preorders aren’t up. Scalpers prob got it
I'm pre-ordering this so hard
already out of stock
Blast it. I just got my Series X last month. Would have waited.
i dont see the pre-order for this anywhere, has it already sold out?
Gonna sell my Xbox series x for the double and buy it

Where's the series S version of that!? I'll love if they do this!! <3
.................... Give me the Green version go go with the new Green Elite controller....... PS5 what are you guys doing for your fans?
Thank you Microsoft for showing this because we cannot buy it and you are doing nothing to ban the scalpers
Wake up John …

Well now we know why they delayed the game an extra year.
Yea it won't be too long where you can just buy the skin off Amazon and just put it on your self make your own limited edition lol but you won't have the blue top but still ok
5 in total will be made....and YOU WILL NEVER GET ONE!!!
✨😍✨
Que-CHULADA!!
My guy it’s a bunch of lines on the series X atleast put mastercheif on it
YESSSSSS
Yay I can't wait to not be able to get one. Btw I blame it 100 percent on Microsoft since they don't mandate retailers to sell their consoles in stores and not online
Ngl that’s sexu
the preorder doesnt work
when can we pre order this??
anyone else sick of those stock alert tweets that never work lol
You can't show the game, but selling custom devices? I thought it was the campaign trailer. Very bad joke.

Maybe if yall would sell these in stores we would have these consoles by now
Was anyone able to get one?
So 700$ dollar console
I wish it came out earlier (crying noises)
That's okay I'll wait for the good ppl @ AliExpress to make housing cases for the Series X
Looks great. Can't wait to see scalpers buying them all and selling them for $1500.  How about increasing production on the regular Series S/X before you start making limited editions?
🙌🙌🙌
I need the fridge version
Limited alright, limited on game content 😆
You cant put normal ones on the shelves, how you going to sell this one 🤔🤔
I knew I should've waited 😤😂🤣
Already sold out
And the game drops December 8th.🎉

It’s gonna be impossible to actually get one without paying $1000 on eBay lol
Where are these pre-orderable?
They should limit one per customer and not allow scalping
When are the UK pre orders going live? I need one.
Where do you pre order it? I can't see the button anywhere
Scalpers: Hippity-hoppity, it’s now my property!
Im crying coz i wont be able to get it

Anyone know the price for this?
That looks pretty. Too bad the Halo of 20 years ago came out with co-op DAY 1 and this 1 DOESN'T!  Yes that's a problem for me.
Question, will this be released on Amazon?
Microsoft just made the scalpers year with these.
How about some regular versions for the rest of us too?
When will we be able to pre order this? Also it looks amazing!
Should be 2tb
