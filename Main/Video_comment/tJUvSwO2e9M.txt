Good
I won all 6matches😂😂 . It is what it is
I want to be a boxer me too
What U say
🎉
Never really watched tank until now, but he's earned a new fan.  Not from just the performance,  but the humbleness and respect he brought to the press conference!
I have realised that humbleness and determination will make Tank to win.
It's impressed.
The second fight???😝 dam
Tanks just going to knock him out again. Team Tank!
Rolly is a poor sport!!no class, he shows poor sportsmanship.. he ran off the Ring.he was embarrassed talk shit talk, he's knoking tank out!! It doesn't pay to talk shit,look at you now! Don't know if your coming or going 🤪🤪🤪
ROLLY THAT'S WHY YOU GOT KNOCKED OUT,YOUR DISRESPECTFUL!! GIVE TANK HIS PROPS 👋, YOU DIDN'T WIN ALL 6 ROUNDS.HES NOT A BITCH,YOU ARE!! DON'T TALK SHIT YOU CAN'T BACK IT UP !! YOU DIDN'T LEARN YOUR LESSON!🤔
Rolly got his ass kicked. His technique is good enough to beat the chumps but Gervonta is seasoned and technically superior.
First comment for a boxer, love Tank for being so humble and mature.
You got knocked out  and you are talking about winning all rounds. You talk too much
What did he expose? Sound like a duck?
they picked NY becuz tank cant sell out tmobile thats y thats where you make money
He knock you out that all
hahahahaha... man  Rolla   you can't say  you win all six  hahahaha  0ne  left punch   you sleep forever .   hahahaha     that's all happened  you get  knockout  srrss hahahaha      RESPECT TO TANK  HE'S THE BEST
i got knocked the fucked out thats all it is .cmon man
spate me davis concerned about Garcia age...he's doing the same shit his bitch promoter did with manny
stank Davis is a punk....Garcia will beat his ass
stand davis is a punk
lomachenko would have more than a shot with rolly 😆 🤣 😂
He said in the second fight? Yeah he got a concussion lol 😆
Next
Yo his trainer ain't talking all that talk he was talking before the fight look at him all quiet and sht from London kome on bud crawford
He’s doesn’t deserve a rematch. Not because of the way he fought, but the way he is still being so disrespectful. All he had to do was be humble. I wouldn’t give him a rematch on that alone!🤷🏾‍♂️
Rolly got his ass handed to him. Davis don’t want that rematch.
Kinda hard to defend somebody who talk all that shit and don’t back it up 🤣
4:04 give Rolly a big hand :Tank Davis, say no more…lmao
Rolly depends solely on his athleticism to win fights . It wouldn’t hurt him to learn some conventional boxing techniques and strategies. He is definitely as strong as a bull and he has lightning speed and reflexes. But, If his trainer can’t teach him these other things, he needs to seek other help. He could be an absolute beast if he gets right. He also seems like he needs help accepting and dealing with this loss. What really bothers me is that his coach is not being honest with him. His coach seems like a yes man and that’s bad for a fighter. The two of them are having a real pity party. Rolly has tremendous potential, but without a good honest trainer that can give him additional new skills, that potential will go wasted.
The ability to even be able to pull that punch 🥊 off, he just looked lightening ⚡️ fast 💨 to me.
WITHOUT TANK, THERE IS NO MAYWEATHER PROMOTIONS
Delusional
"Welcome to the hood rolly" Founder:  Broner Member:  Russel jr Teofimo Lopez Canelo  Rolly the hoods know you beat that boy. we believe in you!!
Rolly exposed nothing lmao u got starched man
This clown
Exposed that Lump on that left side of the head
And…and….and😂🤣
Tank needs to get winner of Kambosos vs Haney. Rollie vs Garcia next!
Rollie: “I exposed him......Tank ran like a b*tch!”  Also Rollie: ——————————————-
Rolly and Bullet really sound like sore losers they are so pathetic! Shout out to the champ, Tank Davis!💪🏾🔥💯
Pitt bull deserves the rematch then right!!!
what a punch!!!!!!! Tank is by far better fighter
Him and Shakur is the dream matchup at 135
Just shut the hell up Rollie. How you want a rematch and you just got knocked out. The ref saved you from a total humiliation to be real with you. Because had he not stopped the fight you would've been knocked clean out
L
Tonto no me interesa😡😡
Rolly was making him run and was winning in my opinion but that's boxing!!!
"He hit me with a shot and I knew I had to stay out the way" 28:10  That's the reason Tank was on his bicycle most of the fight and his punch output was very low. I actually feel Rolly was winning  (letting his hands go more, walking Tank down, hitting Tank with the more effective shots).
Stop crying bro you got KO and that's that. You'r trash talk didn't work.
I don't think Rolly knows what exposed mean. Canelo was exposed not Tank.
Rolly is special also, if ya know what mean.
Shouldn't have been talking shizzznit! "Kat Williams"
This has to be the most delusional team in boxing, he loss and can't accept it, another canelo I guess.
He has no humility he will never be a champ
There’s something about Leonard Ellerbe,, he’s so convincing when he’s selling a fighter to you lol Rolly is trash but he’s making him seem like he’s really 2nd after Tank lol 😂😂
Rollie on teofimo status .. very delusional
“I won every round all six rounds” how the hell you win the round you was TKO’ed in Rolly was still suffering from Tankquil 😴😂😂
Trying to sell his second fighter, he put the lightweight division on notice 😳. By falling asleep 😴.
Tank vs Shakur
Excuses 😂
Great fight. Rolly  must have got hit pretty hard to think he was winning every round. A lot of elbows from Rolly. Great knockout from Gervonta.
I wanna see Tank fight another elite slick boxer. That's why I'm salty we never got the Tank-Farmer fight. Yeah Tank most likely would've won but that woulda been a helluva chess match
Rolly was delusional. Tank  played a game when the opening came he put him on the deck. He was never in this fight.
What a sore loser.
Tank caught Rolly like Marquez caught Manny. Excellent ring generalship & IQ by GTD.
Tank talent wise is P4P flat out
I would have been furious if I had paid like $80US for this fight, & then they stopped it after he got up.
Rolly is definitely delusional, he was way too focus on knocking out tank, and his low ring IQ is the reason why Tank set him up for that left hook.
Rolly is tough.
Trolly’s a SuperClown..Tank will beat him even quicker now he know his power..He need to fight his fellow Troll Lying Ryan Garcia..Troll Wars!!!🥊
Romero is trash . Sorry foot work and poor head movement,  Anyone can swing hard lol but he sucks bad!!  And for RYAN GARCIA , tank gonna lose that one forsure
GOOD WIN AND Let him wear that L.
Romero is a fucking nut case! You got knocked tf out! Exposed? You fell into his game plan!
Shout out to the GOAT Jim Gray……GOAT of awful interviews
He was terrified of me and you was the one knocked out by Clean punch LOL so the running paid off so you can run right into a clean punch LOL
Rowley career might be over the way he was still not focus as he'd walk to the locker room his eyes was going left and right look at his head it was constantly shaking his body was constantly shaking that kind of knockout like that would take over you mentally physically and emotionally and socially he's about to get bashed for that performance you can't talk all that s*** and they get knocked out by a check punch LOL
Deluded boy Rolando Romero is lol
This dude is delusional lol
Tank just earned my deepest respect...
He wants to really go to sleep next time go fight Instagram kid
I won all 6 rounds 😂😂😂
😂😂😂 and he was making fun of pitbull 🤣
😂😂😂 and he was making fun of pitbull 🤣
Facts tank all he did is hold run hold run  in the ref did help him crazy man . 💯
I would like to see Rolly vs Pit bull
That hand motion was his excuse for IF he lost
Respect to Rolly for taking the fight! A lot of guys hold onto their 0 forever fighting cans and avoiding the biggest names in their weight class. Hold your head up and Respects to Tank! Davis always taking care of business! Need more 0 vs 0 matches to go down!
Bro stop acting like it was ur fault u walked into the punch like if Davis had nothing to do with it dude u got put on ur ass!
Me and my wife go to every Gervonte Tank Davis fight in ATL because everything is checked off the list. Speed, technique power knockout and aggression. Thank you Tank eat well and live long Ps. I love Rolly too
Tank Davis is way too good to have the WBA regular he has to get the Super and give Cruz the regular.
Rolly got knocked the fuck out..
Rollie exceeded my expectations, he fought way better than expected, close fight for me before he got dropped
He’s not wrong but tank vs Garcia would be a massive fight even revenue wise
He is mixed  with Adrienne  Bronner  with his post fight rhetoric
Tank did what was expected. Leonard knows he can’t rip off tank anymore. Rolly is done he needs to retire he a bum like tank said
The only way to beat tank is to outbox him. Tank can't box, but he will knock you out. He depends on his power. Something like wilder, can't box for shit, but he'll knock you out.i give Mayweather promotions credit, they have picked the opponents for tank so far. Notice everyone tank has fought he nocks them all out while they are coming in or are exchanging with him? Like I said, the only way to beat him is to stay away and out box him.
ROLANDO ON THE FLOOR ROMERO
Rolly is delusional. He had a couple moments but I had Tank up 1 round before the knockout. Tank showed patience and ability to figure out a fighter. In that fourth round Tank started to figure it out and starting to step on the gas. But great strategy to fight off the back foot against Rolly. He let Rolly aggression set up the shot!
Congrats Tank. Tank stayed poised and stuck to the game plan. Tank has great power and can Ko an opponent out with one shot. To be honest Rolly helped selled the fight. But, that was a good finish by Tank.
Ellerbe talking shite as usual
Rolly was fighting perfectly very strong, had tank on back foot, landed good shots, was quick super sharp, and davies one punch surprised us all. Rolley did well and will be make great comeback...
it was a super fight and a super knockout!!! Floyd Mayweather trained him perfectly
Rolly's footwork is that of a novice, he gets off balance after he throws his so called power shots quite often.
All that talk about a first round knockout and then come out and throw about 10 punches a round lol.
Rolly is a good fighter but a real 🤡 you didn't  jump into a punch you was timed
Rolly needs a new coach he is giving him false hopes and making him delusional he needs a Derek James
You and your coach are bumbs!!! Rollie threw elbows, head butts, and even threw the man down, and still got your ass kicked!!! You won one round the judges felt sorry for you and gave you another!!! Tank kicked your ass, and humbled you and the predator (looking) coach!!! 🤣🤣🤣
You got your ass knocked out
Rolly need to fight Spennce so he can lose again lol. I knew he wouldn't beat tank. All yall team talk about is power and Tank knew that. Like tank told you at the press conference, NONE of your fighters got skills.
Cigar Talk is TRASH F-oh
I LOVE HOW DELUSIONAL HE IS …you just got KO’d and you’re still actin tough LOL I’d probably whoop your ass…the stupid faces you make are priceless
Glad Floyd ain't there lol and rolly ain't shit but another Al fighter
TANK =   BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF MARTIAL ARTS !
Exercise the rematch clause Rolly......lol
Hey lernard….How do you know Rolly is strong, you ugly bellpepper nose? Did you fight him?
only pitbull cruz can survive the davis tank🤫💪
Can’t wait to see what tank does when he signs to Eddie and dazn!
Still talking that smack.smh   Some people never learn
Leonard basically saying devin aint a big enough name yet
Nobody wants to see this fight again he’s trash
Rollie would bully Ryan the whole time no doubt
Run it back? Really?
I wanna knock out al shameman
That knockout really messed up his brain if he thought he won all the rounds. He landed way less punches than Tank in all categories.
Romero didn't put no one on notice, he got knocked out after all that shit he was talking.
Rolly ain't said shit wrong. He just wanna see if tank can knock him out again even though he still gonna wanna another rematch if he gets knocked out again 🤣
Would like to see Tank fight Stevenson 👑 or a rematch with Pitbull 🔥💯
😫🥱😴😪💤
Tank Did Not KO Rolly . T damm Raf. Stop the fight THAT IS NOT A KNOCK OUT IT IS A STOPAGE .  It's a difference between them 2 words . And that dude Lanard n Most black guys working n than boxing world INCLUDING THE stupid Raf. The can say what Ever they want . What IM SAYING , THEY GOING 4 THE BLACKS N NO OTHER RACE  .
Isn’t Floyd in Dubai with Antonio brown? Lol or he was maybe they left but AB might’ve stayed😂
His voice gon a lil deeper too🤣🤣knock the chipmunk outta him
This is chess not checkers. Give him the pawns so u can take the king 😂
Rollies team and fans with All the, if buts wudda shudda cudda but he couldn't do, you got k'od no excuses. I'm glad tank won he so humble🙏🏽
He said he won all 6 rounds 😑😑😑
Honestly I thought Rolly did a good job, but yes Davis got him good with 1 shot while rolly was being open many times & that’s when Davis got him. Davis can’t fight but he definitely is fast when giving out a power shot
Why is the promoter doing all the dam talking shut up let the fighter’s talk geezs
Rollie and Teofimo prolly the most delusional in a time...
He didn’t need to hold his head down. TANK Happily obliged him w/ that part. 🤣
Don’t do jump roping before the fight , yu need your legs
Tell Him stop boasting and bragging,,,,😂
Told y’all, Tank going to whoop Rolly trash talk *ss up
"I exposed him. I won all 6 rounds...I exposed his ass, and everyone in this room knows it...He ran like a bitch...He ran around, he was terrified of me."- Rolly still delusional as fuck.
Where is Floyd now🤔🤔🤔... Floyd was pist, tried too send in a hit man... Floyd didn't even tap in he could of tapped in live. Just out of respect to the sale out crowd
keep saying that's what happened he got a lucky shot in a good shot in well that's what boxing all about then homie you lost
🤔🤔🤔Rolly and his trainer is crazy! Rolly got knocked out on a walk in punch like he said tank will fall too 🤣🤣🤣
Rolly neva gonna be great he way too delusional + his coach trash asl
Rolly will soon be forgotten into oblivion unless you change your ways. You insulted an opponent without grudges towards you in all manner of insults. Ok, let's agree you did it for PPV which you stated everyone should buy because you are KO'ing Tank in 1st round which you didn't achieve, you were KO'ed and I expect you to be a man and say sorry to the man for all your antics before the fight, but you went on still insulting and even lying about what we all saw was a clear beaten. I don't even know about you if not for Tank. Change your ways or the last time you get a fight will be a sparing with a lunatic like you. Your own father even said he preferred you when you were a kid because you don't talk and everyone thought you were deaf.
What🤔🤔🤔...  Trying to promote Rolly at the same time. I get it Tank has left. Poor Rolly was thrown to the wolf's he was nervous on the walk in due to crowd size.
Huge Tank fan but Rilly was winning that fight ,Tank got stung a few times he felt eRolly ,Tank caught him clean but he looks like a fool laughing at Roly cause he was all over Tank
Rolly is salty asf and hating
You got caught walking in and got caught with a pretty left
Bullet lol
Lol
GTD
Bravo gervonta 🖤❤️ After rolly next ?🤔
Rolly should have rushed him and let his hands go. He had success early on when he rushed tank and let his hands go. He should have went for the KO. It was his one and only chance. No way was he going to outbox tank or beat him with skill.
Crazy how rolly n coach bullet still talking greasy in defeat but tank took the high road and showed why he is the great champion he is in victory. Shows the level difference between the two n why one is on top n one just got knocked out. Smh let’s go Tank!! Bmore is very proud of you!! 💪🏽💯
Last time I looked we don’t” Run it back”  after getting knocked out…!  Tank closed ya mouth  after all ya bs talk.. 👍👏👏👍
I wish the ref would have let him get his ass beat and not stopped the fight. This guy has zero class, a sore loser and has no sportsmanship
Rolly is a complete clown. Gotta save face. Like you would have beat Tank with a jab. Ran out the ring like a coward.
Ellerbe has an eye for talent. He told us about Tank early on.
I am Cuban you are brave but in boxing you win with technique and you don't have you put pressure on David you made him run but the tea was marrying with a blow and your corner didn't tell you I advise you to change corner and look for another one I taught the art of boxing which is to hit and don't get hit
Delusional. Tank scared? Nah, Tank took all the smoke and extinguished Rolly’s fire!
Nobody wants to see roly tank again👎🏾🥊
This dude is delusional lol
Devin haney cant punch and i predict he will smash roly and  win every round, SKILLS PAY THE BILLS, ROLY HAS NONE, JUST A STRONG GEEZRR
Tank haters who rooted for him to get KO all who said ROLLY was a step up in competition EVERYFUCKING BODY he put that ass 2 sleep 🛌 😴  foh
Knocked out and still not humble. Bullet needs to get out of boxing. Wrong attitude and c level training.
Congrats to Tank.  This fight proves the saying "Skills pay the bills".  5:08 "I won all six rounds..."  Rolly is one funny dude.  He lost to a more technical fighter, no shame in that.  It wasn't a beatdown.
I wonder if rolly really believes 🤔the things he's saying or is he completely delusional 🤔
Guys what do you think isac pitbull vs rooly next?
Coach bullet on the powda
running,hurt stiff jab.they both delusional Geesha🤣What fight was they in
He saying tank was running the whole fight that’s Floyd whole style of fighting
He wants to say he’s trash so bad 😂
Rolly go back to sleep 😴 💤  dude you still concussed 🥊
NO WATER IN THE CONFERENCE
Rolly is trippin’ 🤣🤣🤣!!!
If there's a second fight between the 2 Tank with surely take his head off:I'm just laughing at his arogance.
Haney vs Tank in December….thumbs up if you agree
Love Tank’s calmness and maturity. Confident and not cocky…love how he carries himself.
You don't deserve a rematch you got 💨💨💨🥊
Romero’s career will be short if he doesn’t learn how to box.
Nah he set you up that's what you call a professional boxer my man you still got a lot to learn young kid and if you do get the rematch this is going to happen You're going to knock your ass out again what you going to say then
Much Respect ti TANK surprised at his answers & how humble and mature he sounds 💯💯
Wait I’m confused, how are George Kambosos jr or Devin Haney gonna be undisputed if Gervonta still has the WBA lightweight belt?
What caused that bruised on Davis temple? Ik he was even looking at it himself after the fight in the ring…
Rolly is still concussed here. He needs to be in the hospital for a check up rather than doing this press conference.
Congratulations to my brother tank for knocking that mother f***** out all I want to know is the golden question where was Mayweather why Mayweather didn't want to show his face to see his boxer getting knocked the f*** out 💨🥊💰💯😭😭😭😭
Second fight? 🤣
Why are they still talking tho they need to be HUMBLE
Rolando🤕😭Romero plain got his ass handed to him on a platter, this dude's just a shit talker plain and simple  !
🍒🤏 Davis
People talking like tank did something big…..he was fighting a 14 fight novice who’s borderline retarded. L.E saying Rolly is one of the top lightweights lmfao
This guy a bitch!! Both him and his coach!! You got the knocked, light work. Tank was patient... then bang!!
Referee is not giving Rolly Romero a chance to fight. It is very clear that Rolly is still strong to fight. I think the referee was paid by Floyd Mayweather promotions to let his fighter Tank Davis to win. It is very clear that when referee command Rolly to step  at right side he followed it and why the referee stops it? Stupid referee!! The audience did not satisfy what they paid as it was fraud or we call in Filipino nabudol si Rolly ng referee at ng Team ni Mayweather promotions.
what was the scorecard before the knockout?
Now this fight is in the book let's get to the real fights for Tank like Crawford,Ennis,Devin,Spence and maybe Garcia now since Garcia likes attention why don't he fight Ennis or Devin because right now Tank is the top dog with all eyes on him and if he leaves Mayweather Boxing and becomes his own boss the money is his to make as long as he keeps winning so I say good job for the win and be your own boss and make your own money,how does Davis Boxing Promotion  sounds and with this day and time you don't have to be 50-0 to do it.
Rolly, "I beat him, everybody out there know I beat him!"
"You guys just have to be patient" code word, keep on milking the fans on mediocre match ups for tank....
Buddy McGirt did a pretty good job hosting the post fight press conference and got that pimp look on point too.
Dude still talking.. Terrified? A scared fighter won't do a sh*t like what Tank did. You hit him good, but dude's pretty waiting for that moment. You only got one shot. The end.
Rolly never congratulated Tank.
Big Rollo said Tank only hit him with one big shot when he actually got timed and hit by a few clean ones, but for argument sake lets say Rolly's right & he only got hit by one big shot what does that say about Rolly's chin. Some people should think before they speak & ask themselves is what I'm going to say gonna make me look bad or like a fool before I open my mouth. Just saying food for thought. Before this took place I said Tank would KO Rolly in the 5th or 6th round and said even if he dont I dont see anyway this goes past 10 & had also predicted Big Rolly would be on the next youtube episode of "when trash talking goes wrong". Now lets see if Big Rollo makes the cut and I'm right again.
Well Leonard,  you don't have Davis anymore, don't you?
Rolly forgot that he got knocked silly
Running around like a b*tch? You were literally staying 2 pivots away from him all night until you got too aggressive after your corner told you to take him out lol… Stop the cap Romero
Easy to be humble when you win
Girl Plats
Let's keep it real, Rolly was winning until the knockout. He stunned Tank a few times but ultimately Tank finished the job and proved to be the harder puncher. Great job Tank!!
Tank is a truly learning the sweet science. Absolute Warrior.
"I want a re-match because he just caught me with a nice shot, that's all". That's what Tank does, kidda...hits people with good shots!
Won all 6??? He’s still dazed
Video starts 29:45
35:35 anyone else crack up over that aggressive water bottle toss. Great hands coach.
His brain wasn't right still up till that point of questioning..what the heck is he talking about 2nd fight Lmaoooo...  😳 his brain is froze and know you just lose and now you're begging for a fight!! Please 🙏 don't ask for another fight and then demeanor his ability for whooping your ass!!! Pure loser...loser loser loser, heck out of talking loser.
I don't understand how rolly can still say that he won all 6 rounds when before the knockout tank he was winning by points, rolly put up a very good fight but he is not at the level of the great tank
Tank scared he don’t want no rematch
Rolly Foldy goodnight queen 👸
Rolly.... sore loser that's why he lost no focus... congrats TANK.. it was only a matter of time before you got him..🔥🔥
Rolly polly olly was saved by them ropes. Tank almost knocked him off the big stage TWICE 🤣🤣🤣
jjajjajajjaja. He sounds just like. Teofimo Lopez. he still sleepinggggggg and dreaming
Tank is so humble and laid back i love it. I hope he runs the roster up bc rolly and others like him ain’t gone learn until you inna ring w him and get sent to God. Noodle legs and all. He did it, that’s it. NEXT CALLLLERRRR
These clowns 🤡 stupid I never wanna see them again tank won 🏆 yo they sound stupid yo... he done.... he didn't expose shit rolly coach stupid too......fools all that shit talk 😒 🤣 😴
looks like a conference between a child and an adult.
Rolly coach more out of touch with reality than Rolly concussed ass 😂
Tank prove me right he sets most of his opponents up for the kill shot no matter if he lost some rounds same goes for Slolly
“Stiff jab” dude ☠️ Every fighter in boxing has a stiff jab otherwise they wouldn’t be boxers.. you got laid out dawg, hell naw he ain’t taking a fight again with someone he already just slept 😂😂🤡🤦🏻‍♂️
Not going to cap I had rolly 4-1 before that 6th rd
Exposed what!!!? Rolly basically caught with a clean one, suffered the Loss n now uttering that nonsense calling out tank dare one state insisting for a rematch..    which bout did rolly walk away with winning 6 rounds.   Not this one🤦🏾‍♂️  amazing fight congrats rolly at least now he gon get his mumma that house.
Leonard speaking facts. Told no lies.
Rolly wants rematch 🤣  Ryan Garcia and Shakur Stevenson are next in line
Rolly is clearly concussed y'all...... Of course you wouldn't run into a shot like that again 😂 but it happened and here we are... 🤷🏾‍♂️
*I gave Ryan Garcia the biggest L of the night*
What fight was Romero at? You got knocked out, you didn’t even know where you were! The ref helped you out cause you couldn’t take another hit, your legs buckled you were laid out on the ropes in a daze!
Romero did not hurt Tank anytime! Tank had a good defense. Tank was waiting for that stupid mistake from Romero! And, he scored a knockout by Romero punching to the body with the head up high exposed! And, Romero wants to get knocked out again in a rematch!
This man is delousnal lmao 😂😂😭
I knew ROLLY was gonna get KOd by trying hard to KO him 😂💯🤷🏾‍♂️ never fails with dum fighters😂😂😂 Tank said he was a dum ass fighter 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Those are good fights vs Kambosos and Haney and Garcia but I think Tank beats them all. Shakur vs Davis wb big tho
do tank has the tongue damaged?
Baltimore Tank
Leonard  tap dancing like mr bo jangles..🤣🤣🤣 please stop interviewing him ...did yall see how excited he got when they said romero vs garcia.???🤣🤣🤣🤣.. we all know that ryan garcia is big name in boxing.. way bigger then romero.. Leonard is full of sh!t..and he knows it. He wanna keep gettin tank easy fights he can win.  Thats gon back fire when he has to fight the other guys haney ,loma,shakur, etc.🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
What did he expose?
Rolly is to delusional. He didn’t expose Tank. If anything he fell into Gervonta trap. Smh kid is dumb as hell
You had your chance and got knocked the fuck out
If you understand the sport of boxing, you’d know Tank wasn’t “running”. All he was doing was luring Rolly in, there’s a difference.
Leonard sound like he sick of Ryan name coming up and he’s tried to do business with them but the the duck ran away
Rolly coach is mostly the problem in this situation. A fighter can't get better when their coach/ trainer keeps lieing and bullshiting them smh
Judging my rollies comments, hes still halfway knocked out.
Tank is so classy & mature.
He’s concussed he got asked a question and asked in the second fight🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 They only fought once rollys a fuckn clown he’s on a different planet💯🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rolly is a mental patient. Swinging wildly and missing to him is Tank running. Bullet says he can out box 90% of the fighters in boxing. Recipe for disaster. These dudes need to stop talking
Never really watched tank until now, but he's earned a new fan. Not from just the performance, but the humbleness and respect he brought to the press conference!
This Rolly you can tell he's young he's got confidence to much confidence if there's a rematch he will get knocked out sooner. Tank Davis shouldn't go up in weight class if anything down. He weigh in just over 133lbs. When you go up to much in weight look what happened to Canelo.
tank came thru w/the left & took’em out.. simple as that.. tank had precision & patience.. juss laid’em out.. tank is a technician in the ring.. he collects the data... wears’em out… then boom wack… lightz out.. good nite.. congrats tank.. hol-it down.!!!
Tank pretended to be hurt in that round just so rolly can push in so tank could catch him with the k.o
Tank vs Shakur will be big
Tank buckled Romeros legs twice in that fight, Tank was never hurt in that fight. All Romero was doing was rushing in which caused him to run into that nice sleeper.
Rolly didn’t win 1 round he was scared to swing after a body shot or two
This dude is still knocked out 🤣🤣🤣
Rolly still has not learned his lesson. He feels like he made tank run like a b***h, instead of realizing he got lured into a trap.
When your mouth punch more than your hands🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fight pitbull again. Let him get the right preparation . Tank kos but he also receives a lot of punches
Tank Canelo'd Rolly 🤣
Does it seem like they don’t want Davis fighting Ryan Garcia? This guy said Rollie is better than Ryan Garcia? They do t want Tank to lose
After watching that I do feel tank will come unstuck against a more skilled fighter with range. I like tank but he said in the build up he’s more skilled than canelo Respectfully I personally don’t see it.
I died when he said run it back 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
33:00 tell that to Ramirez 🤣🤣 stop tryna hype up Rolly to make him seem like a top tier opponent for tank
ROLLY BEATS RYAN
great fight he just need a new trainer. same thing with wilder he got fixed up same thing with rolly get a new trainer fix him up he’ll be the next big thing i think he’s confident in what he does give him more confidence in other things he’ll be a big champion
Davis never was on problems !  What a  2 ble looser …. Now he making another story !!!!😂😂😂😂
Rollie has a concussion.. cause he is talking Out the side of his head
Man i need what Romero smoking 🌿 💨💨💨
“people don’t deserve a rematch when they get knocked out like that” 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽 exactly what i said to my homie Rolly don’t deserve a rematch
Lmao tank was never hurt
YOU LOST, accept it fam.
In what part of the fight did Rolly expose Tank? He talked all that crazy shit and got knocked the fuck out, Give Tank his credit and move on. Now Rolly sounds like a delusional cry baby.
They don’t do rematch’s them niggas is really on some bs
Rolly was definitely up 3-2 he fought well I can’t even lie
tatonya minta amput, coba lawan ryan garcya pasti gak tau jalan pulang🤣
Still talking 💩. Done with this trick.
True Words from ROLLIE!!!!!💥🥊
It’s crazy that shobox had tank landing more wat fight they watching
Maybe I watched the wrong fight but Tank throughout the 6 rounds was landing clean shots Rolly was still swinging wild he landed a few but Tank used footwork defense and his ring intelligence showing he could box & be a brawler ppl think he’s easy because he’s short but he uses that to his advantage
NOW there saying Tank is ducking David Benavidez 🤣🤣🤣
not good enough to not loose the biggest fight of his life, and the kid wants more of the same.
And still talking shit !!! You got k the fuck out
And still talking shit !!! You got k the fuck out
Tank the face of cherry picking!! Where are all the elite fights? Tank is wack as crap
Still sounds like a girl.
Rolly cane in the size of a welterweight! WHAT ARE THE EXCUSES NOW???
Where is Mayweather talking about how great he is at?
Man he still has a concussion 🤕😂 bro still think they are promoting the fight
PPL FAIL TO SEE THAT TANK ALLOWS U TO HIT HIM TO GET U NICE & COMFY FOR YOUR PILLOW U ABOUT TO USE😴😴
Sheesh him and his trainer are delusional lmao
I knew it. Rolly loads up way too much and got caught mid combo. His stance is way too wide when he throws also
Dis man in love with Gervonta 🤣
Tank classy Rolly is a big vulgar mouth, he's weak he's done, bye 👋  big mouth.
Even Rolly trainer thinking Rolly delusional asf talking abt he won all 6 rounds 🤣
Rolly and his trainer got to be 2 of the most delusional guys in all of sports.
Lmfao boy said he can outbox 90% of boxers 😂😂😂 wtf is wrong with these guys.  Wait, This the same guy in a interview leading up to the fight discrediting “boxers” cause His fighter has power. 😂😂😂 sheeeesshh it’s spooky out here.
In the words of the late great John Weatherspoon:  "you win some, you lose some... but you live to fight another day"
All these excuses..smh
HE WANT A REMATCH.. U WILL GET HIT WITH ANOTHER CLEAN SHOT SILLY
I’d like to see Rolly vs Jake Paul 👀😂.
He still got the money to buy his mother a house, I want to fight Gervonta too, this looks like easy money. Getting knocked out and still be rich, I'd love to do this.
The judges score card was shown after clearly Rolly didn’t win all 6 rounds! 3-3 in my eyes
Rolly is so mad, can’t take a L
Tank is humble dosen't doesn't want to disrespect rolly.he know that boi just talking
we need to run dat shit back ...
Come on Rolly. I like you as a fighter but it's hard to support you when you can't take the loss like a man😒😒😒😒 Hope he learns from this fight.
You got knocked out. Accept the ass whipping .
ROLLY U GOT KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT 🤣🤣🤣💯
"Just came up a little bit short". The dude didn't even make it halfway...
rolly saying he felt like he won all 6 rounds before being slept lmaoooooooooo
Rolly has a lot of weaknesses and needs to go back to the drawing board so that opportunities to knock him out won't be so evident.  As soon as he went in to make a fight of it he got knocked the spark out.
Rolly told everyone to bet their house on this fight   A moment of silence for the homeless 😞😞
Sorry Rolly. No rematch. Can't get ko'd then ask for a remarch
Where is Don King ? Devilish ass at ???
The ref had nothing to do with that left hook
Davis i Know his no. 1 inspiration is Mike Tyson and not Mayweather cause they're bot all out fighter rather than Mayweather a defensive Genius and a calculator fighter.
Rolly really got a concussion thinking he won all 6 rounds 🤣🤣
He is delusional
This fight showed me tank isn't that good he's highly overrated and y'all giving him praise for beating up rolly like he was some legit champion ain't no way he beating Shakur or haney
We know he told that ref he didn't want anymore smoke when he stood up if u pay attention.....
You win some you lose some, Rolly has NOTHING to be ashamed of..   He's still a young man, he'll be back..   And CONGRATULATIONS to Tank on this win against Rolly tonight..
Congrats champ tank
"In the 2nd fight?" 35:22
No rematch !!! He got KTFO. !!!
Who’s the man In white suit?
Ryan is a goat stop sleeping on him dead ass
So much unnecessary time in this vid😅, vid starts a 29:45
🚨🚨🚨 Not surprising Oh boy didn’t want to be a man & address the media after he took that knockout L but talked BIG tough talk beforehand.  WHERES THAT SAME ENERGY⁉️💥🦍
Congrats Tank!! Always a humble person. Happy you recalibrated yourself from taking the fight too personal. As you said this boxing. Cheers to both of you.
WHERE ALL THE HATERS AT NOW🇲🇽🤣🤣 WE RUN BOXING 🇺🇸🤴🏿☝🏿🥊🥊💯 ALWAYS WILL
Congrats to the referee…. He could have made the fight continue and rolly won’t be here doing an interview. And also Rolly leave Tank alone , fighting on the back foot is not running . It’s a skill reserve for those who have mastered the art of boxing.  And the shot you were caught with was legal so what you complaining about talking about a rematch and you winning all 6 rounds. It’s a 12 rounds fight . Sore loser. And the least said about the trainer the better ….
Rolly Wept.
Delusional rolly 😂😂
This guy is a Bum with a foul mouth !!!
I wonder 🤔 if Rolly was in Special  ED
Why Romero won’t talk to the press after the fight 😂😂😂😂
😭 Knew this 💩was coming..Tank beats #1 rank contender with.. well had no losses and he 🍒 him...😭 I must be psychic. 🔮
😂😂😂😂😂😂 these dudes delusional
Davis vs Maidana comparison former 100% knock out artists. Aside Maidina is in upper division what else?
Rolly didn't come out cuz he's still laying down somewhere from that knockout 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💯💯
What did the 5 fingers say to the face?? SMACK!!! That was cooooolldddd bloooooded Ahahahha Bang bang !!
Excuses excuses excuses that's all it is and then he got knocked out
There nothing lucky when you’re a master boxer
Nobody can talk no shit rolly's legs turn to putty haaaaaaaaa lol a yo son stop playing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow, now imagine Tank fights someone of worth. Doesn't look good.
He should have respected tank power
Rolly won 6 rounds but only lost to ONE PUNCH! Take away that one punch and rolly won.
Rolly aka “Sometimes you write a check with your mouth, that your as$ can’t cash!” - An Old Black Proverb 🤣🤣🤣
