Which cast members from The Office do you want to see on Hot Ones?
I know this video is old but Wow I’m super proud of Ed! I really thought he was gonna tap out!! Well done! 😮
No matter what role he's in, Ed Helms comes off as just the guy next door. The guy you wave to on your way to work and have conversations about football and your kids.
He Is So awesome in the Hangover. Hilarious 😂He is handling the chicken wings,like a BoSS!!!!!
I love watching this show for Shawns interview skills alone, he has the best interview skill I’ve ever seen ! Keep up the awesome work !
Wonder if Andy still has it out for Broccoli Rob?
"Dance your cares away 👏👏 worries for another da-a-ay let the music play 👏👏 down at fraggle rock" 😁😁
He needs to reprise his role as Principal Benjamin Krupp/Captain Underpants for Captain Underpants 2!! Who’s with me, we need to make an online petition for this!! He needs to come back to voice Benjamin Krupp/Captain Underpants, he was made for this!!
At first im like "what is he talking about " with the narration. Then he starts reading it and I instantly recognize his voice spouting all this nonsense about mesotheleoma. Lol.
I'm a heavy metal guitar god, I've been playing for about 30 years or so, and I pride myself on being able to play practically anything with strings. Banjos be hard dude. Like I've been able to pick up and play everything from violins to harps to guitars and pianos. Banjos be hard dude. I highly respect any banjo player. Banjos, they be hard dude. Ask any non banjo player. Banjos be hard yo.
hangover part IV immediately following this video
"Dont bother" lol
He just really is the NARD DOG!!!!
😂😂😂 was one of my favorite episodes yet
Trice
Good job Ed.
Da bomb is a great rodent repellent...true story.
The background music is relentless lol
"I'm still happy"
Sean impressing him with the first three out the gate!
So many seasons and guests watched on this show. It's absolutely my favorite interview show ever.  ❤🌶🌶🌶 ❤
I love the Los Calientes Rojo pringles! I need to order some of this sauce! It is so delicious! Well, assuming it tastes the same.
“And we’re gonna pack up those sauces for you!” Ed: “Don’t bother.” 🤣🤣🤣
Ed Helms I love you please don’t like kids I loooveee you ❤
THE FIRES SHOOTING AT US
Im still waiting for Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer or BJ Novak
ED HELMS YOU’RE A GEM
I love Ed Helms! I love boiled peanuts! I love Andy Bernard! And I have a unique affection for the banjo; my nono played it in vaudeville & i grew up singing & dancing to it!
ed is of the finest characters
When I was in college (Cornell) I was in one, Here Comes Treble. -Andy- YAY! Andy and Jim re-unite!
BANJO IS AWESOME !!!
Something real and switched on about this episode. Snotty noses and all 😅
lol da bomb all small but mighty
Jason Segal would be an amazing guest
Anyone know what interview he did after this? I really would love to see it lol
Imagine if Sean interviewed a politician 😂😂😂
he's so andy
Anyone know where the interview after this one is?? Love to see it 😂😂😂
ed helms seems to be a truly good person
At least ed was finishing most of the wings / sticks
Whatever you do don’t rub your eyes.
Da’ Bomb tastes fine , not the problem
Ed Helms is very similar to Andy lol.
So did his show not so good ?. Because it’s not on peacock anymore
Edd helms realizing he’s literally Andy from the office while talking about acapella groups 😂 . You can see the sudden change in his face lol
I love Ed Helms so much 😄 this interview was excellent
I've just discovered this channel, I've watched a lot of interviews with celebrities and Sean is by far the best I've ever seen. Every video is a pleasure to watch
"This is super cool and fun and . . . harmful."  Perfect statement for this show.  Thanks, Ed (and Sean).
This is the most affected I’ve ever seen Sean
The hangover tag and vacation are some of his greatest movies
Ed Helms hasn't slept for a decade.
We NEED KAMALA HARRIS!
Great episode; great interview! Always impressed with the "deep cuts" questions you ask.   I have a question-- do the guests have a "safe word" or gesture to let you know they might truly be having a moment of duress... or does the editing just take out those moments?
“We’re going to package some sauces for you to take home”  “don’t bother” 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 what a great way to end
You should see if the cast of hangover will do a tap out in a round table none stop hot wings last man standing....😂
When he mentions roller-coaster. All I can think of is,  the end of the newest vacation movie.  All of his family singing kiss from a rose in accapella
Great show!
so he was a voiceover actor? no wonder, i mean HIS VOICE totally beautiful :')
0:35
"wittwe Andy is afwaid"
"Boiled peanut stands were a part of my childhood. My dad was from alabama" Me from alabama: I've never seen a peanut stand
He starting to look like Jim Bruer's guy from Half Baked
Pimento Cheese - I described it to a friend of mine from the North.  You know how there’s Egg Salad and Tuna Salad?  Pimento Cheese is Cheese Salad!  What could be better than that?
greatest man alive
Is it just me, or are there are a lot of onceler comments in here that literally have only 5 likes, but you can still see them near the top of the comment section.
Ed is the human form of a cupcake.. he's so sweet and lovely
After the bomb, he looks very similar to that scene from the office when he washes his eyes 😂
Perfect opportunity to say “how bad can this possibly be”
That voice onceler from the lorax
He and Steve Martin are banjo brothers!😂
Did he not wipe a bit of his last dab off?
How bad can the spice actually be?
Hot ones guests just can’t keep themselves from appreciating the quality of questions. That just is a testimony of how amazing these interviews are.
Andy came out after the first question with his answer having his old nickname
I think that's the worst I've seen Sean react. New to these videos but enjoying the content!
ngl, now every time i hear a mesothelima commercial, i hear this man
🤔 This is starting to make me think. 🤨 Maybe Scoville Units isn't that accurate! 😂 They get to the BOMB and it's all over.😅
"My nose is sprinting," what a great little idiom.  Yoink, that's mine now.
Watching this video is making me want to watch father figures for bedtime tonight but I mainly watch it because I love Owen Wilson sorry Ed once again you're not my type 😂
I like this show. It's the show with hot wings and even hotter questions. Get it?
helms is the man
Can't wait to watch Baby-wah-wah eat hot-ones
We're gonna package up the hot sau.. Don't bother
Not even one wing in, and he’s already busting out his old acapella nicknames with “asbestos tongue”. I bet broccoli rob gave him that one.
Can you invite Katt Williams as a next guess? Its going to very funny to see him eat spicy chicken LOL!!  I love Ed Helms, funny awesome guy too.
im in love with ed helms
I don't know why but I just got the constant impression he didn't want to be there.  Like right at the end, talking while basically walking away.
It’s Egg Helms!
Hot sauce #3 or #4 is not accurate...Ed says "beyond insanity" and the shown hot sauce was Da Bomb... which wasn't showing the biohazard sign but the nuclear one right? Much love from Bahia state... Brazil's northeast "hot sauce" region...
“Don’t bother” 😅
Is Ed afraid of Covid?
That’s so great he has a new show with Jim!
How boring.  Got through 5 mins.  Next!
Ed Helms have a very nice personality!-)
probably the classic michael, dwight, and jim + kevin?
We need Jon Stewart on this show. Let’s make it happen.
New title: The Onceler eats hot wings
Actually, more talk about bluegrass!
Ed is like the older brother of every rich female I've ever been with since high-school.
When his nose starts running at the end 😭🤣
The part where they said they'll pack those bottles of sauces and he goes "don't bother"🤣
Ed Helms is awesome. Nuff said.
should have served him a wing in Jell-O and watched him lose his freaking mind
bro i only know ed helms for the captain underpants movie 😢
Andy Bernard
pets? It just me or did it look like Ed has a mole or growth on the end of his nose on his left side?
why isn't there "Da Bomb beyhond Insanity" in the packs you sell on your Website?
Coco Ghost "chocolate" I don't think so🫣 I'm Mexican and in spanish we refer to "El Coco" as the boogie man😬🤣🤣🤣
Ed Helms is the only person in the world where I just can’t see him talking as a real person. Any other actor I see as an actual person, and then Ed Helms just seems like he’s playing a comedic role and I can’t unsee it 😂
A scholar and a gentleman thus far. He's halfway. On we go.
Eds a nice guy. Fun stuff
I don't even watch for the hot sauce anymore, just for celebrities to tell Sean how amazing he is at asking questions.
The uplifting music makes me smile 😂
I just realized I've been using Da Bomb Ground Zero, not Beyond Insanity. Which one is the worst?
It looks like Shaun is struggling today 😂
ed helms invented babygirlism here
Excellent
Great Banjo players.. include Steve Martin! Love a good Banjo player!
another great episode...got to learn some more about Mr. Helms.
My kid absolutely loves this guy because hes Captain underpants and the Once-ler. Im glad he seems like a good guy
Such a handsome & classy guy.
Get Michael Franzese on here!
i love ed <3
Hi
he's so hot
Da bomb turned him right into the nard dogg
I love him even more after this
I wish Hot Ones would tag the “after” interview the guests have to do during the press circuit. That would be next level.
Hey Hey my kid is the  co president of the Obertones. They've sung at my house.
The Onceler ate alot of hot wings but didn't suffer the death
Look at you, Stu. You're cool. Powered through the wings of death. The generic ad music accompanying Ed Helms reading an ad was like putting a cherry ontop of a cake.
Ed Helms seems to be a solid dude. Respect.
How bad can i be
There's a dark side to him.
I'm sorry I like Ed Helms but does he think he is like Bill Murray or Steve Martin the way he talks about himself?? Just my opinion this was as boring as the office.
How bad could he possibly be?
how bad can this be
23:29 I can't believe I didn't know about a spinoff with Andy and Jim!
Over the years, this guy has grown on me. And what a legend he is
Love Eggs reactions here
I am actually amazed by the fact that I have the same tooth condition as Ed. The top 2nd ones never grew, so at the age of 38 I had the braces, made the neighbour teeth move aside and got implants.
Great interview once again, loved how he got into the interview and wings after that painful number 8, stuck it out, and went for it!
Nice ep ^^
Andy Bernard did great!
A funny guy, a fantastic actor and the man who gave us the unforgettable guy who went to Cornell and played the banjo.
He’s went far past the good old days
way to go Ed.  You dah man
16:05 radiation symbol
Ed Helms is a hot one
Ed Helms always seems like just a fun guy to be around. Anyway, he did extremely well considering how much pain he was clearly in. Pushed through it and gave some great answers
I can’t stop giggling at another person’s pain… that doesn’t make me a bad person though haha…
Dude the guitar playing in the beginning ❤❤
Gabe Lewis please!! While in character
Is it just me or anyone else feels every time they see a hot ones episode they suddenly crave a bucket of hot wings too?
Does anyone watch the first 15 minutes of any of these?
"Don't Bother" - Ed Helms
DID KRASINSKI DO THE SHOW?
Ed seem like such a good guy
We need Creed Bratton from The Office!
When did he become so old? 💔💔
WHO THE F IS  Ed Helms WHO CARES GET WITH IT. Your show is hitting bottom
The onceler eating spicy chicken.
You need to eat more to keep up with your guests!  They eat half or more and you only eat a bite generally.  oO  I would love to do a test against you with a stare down if it meant getting my daughter back home sooner.
Always love your line of questioning to your guests. Definitely can tell you care about what you do. Keep it up Sean!!
He took it like a champ but bounced quick af. This was a chore for him for sure.
PROPS. to Ed Helms and pimento cheese sandwiches!!   A pimento cheese sandwiches probably good with these hot sauces!!  He almost gave up didnt... great comeback !!  awesome!!
That clicking music in the background is totally annoying! I had to pause to see what was clicking in my house when it started. Yeah, don’t do that.
Should've had the tooth removed on the sly and freaked everyone out with your dedication to the role.
I would very much like to know what his next interview was so I can watch it
We need Steve carrell or rainn Wilson PLEASE
Ed Helms is such a good guy
Bro was about to die😂😂😂😂
He is so handsome when he smiles
Ed is one of the nicest actors around! Love everything, he does! Mouth medic! That's a good one! LOL!
Saw the show in my recommendations for 2 years. And hooked up recently just in two episodes. And guess why? The sound. gush, hats off to sound director, or editor, or designer or all of them. The music selection, the sound mixing, everything is so brilliant! But guess what. In a restaurant you go for the food and stay for the music. Here is the opposite, now I watch and eat wings with a hot sauce.
This guy is very intelligent.
This is what we wanted Matthew Perry to turn out like
I love how he was so ove the whole thing at the end that he said "don't bother" when they said we are packing these up for you at the end hahaha
I liked hot food in my teens and 20’s, my brother called be asbestos tongue. When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke. I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, boot, rally, more soco, head to class.
How b-a-a-a-ad can it be, I'm just eating some delicious wings
Andy and Jim have a show together ❤️
Can't wait to check out Andy and Jim on their new show on Peacock
Id like to see a bad friends hot ones
I couldn't stop laughing. The both had me roflma
vacation
Andy Bernardddd
I am from Alabama walker county I would love to be on Ed’s new show I could tell some stories about my dad that was chief of police and stories he told me….keep it up Ed love you brother
This is what he gets for leaving Erin to go on a boat trip
Have Trisha Paytas do this please
You're a real Southern boy if you love boiled peanuts and pimento cheese.
Egg Helms is such a nice guy
PLEASE get Zach Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Lawrence on Hot Ones
The Real Nard Dog
It’s EGG Helms, get it right, geez.
Hangover
we need Payton list on the show !!!!!
LOVE YOU ED! WISH YOU THE BEST!
I always get hungry after hot wings when I watch this so jealous
He said car crash, but I think he was trying to say c0€k rash.
You gotta love this man, he was hurting form win 3 but then went full on Savage but enjoyed every wing with Sean. Very humble person thank you 😊
I just ordered all the hot sauces they use since I know I'll never be on thoa show and when I grt the sauces I'm gonna record it lvor with your next episode and send it to you guys with all the pain I'll be in
Make the rest of the Hot Ones/Office crossover series!
good video.
He did grab a question for Bill Burr from Reddit. So I’m guessing he’s listening to the die hard fans with these types of interesting never before asked questions. Which is pretty cool, good job Sean Evans team!
I'm just imagining him from Brooklyn 99 doing this
I think there are 2 reasons I love this show.  1. The guest is always eagerly waiting for the next question.  2. The host is always actively interested and enjoys the answers.  None of this is forced. It may be the hot sauce, but I feel the show is just the vibe I described.
Da Bomb beyond insanity is a heat cheat like Dave’s insanity sauce.  Heat pumped up with capsaicin extract.
Love that guy
I absolutely love Ed Helms!
Love this episode but I'm bummed there was no mention of Rutherford falls.
Bring CREED BRATTON
My birthday twin!! 💙💙💙
There's never been a sad song played on a banjo. That's the defense of the banjo.
Do zendaya !!!!!!
Man, they really need the eliminate that BOMB sauce!! clearly, it's ACID!!! Pure POISON!!! It's really dangerous!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Oh wow. Egg Helms himself.
I am dying for daddy Stephen Colbert to be on this show
Did you think his name was Ed? It's Egg! Egg Helms!
Ed is really looking like Jim Brewer in this episode. I’m thinking he may have gotten Half Baked before the filming.
Streaming exclusively on peacock... oh I guess I’m never gonna watch that
“Break me off a piece of that apple sauce, football cream.”
I shall watch it. If that makes any difference.
Can they get Jason Bateman on there😂
Thank you
Sean is literally the Tiger Woods of interviewing. Near enough every interview his guest will say "that's a great question" at least once!
I’m glad to see that baby wawa finally made it to the top
Seems like Sean spent a few seasons just rolling with it so well and now he’s gone back a bit and is feeling the sauces more again.
this was one of my favorite and i would have never expected it!
Kelly,!! I
The no-tooth/tooth/no-tooth/tooth story was too much! XD
do you guys pay for people to come on?
is it just me or is the music edited in way too loud.
Da Bomb really got Sean on this one, that was humbling lol WE NEED CREEEEEEEEED
I don't like that he didn't shake your hand or give you a hug after that, just kinda walked off. Still, outside of that he seems like a chill dude. Work on that etiquette though!!
Who's out there hating on Banjos? 😂
Every one cries in the bathroom after every episode....😂
seeing Ed helms here, my life is complete
It’s always the guys I think are going to have a total meltdown that actually surprise me and handle themselves so well through the pain
I've watched so many hot ones, I love Ed and I love Sean, but I've rarely seen Sean so little invested in an interview
Love the boiled peanuts and pimento cheese talk!!!
"Just having something in my mouth is soothing" -Ed
He reminds me of easter
This show is da bomb
You guys at hot ones are Dogs
I think if you ever heard Bela Fleck, you would change your "tune" about banjos. Works pretty well for Steve Martin too.
Creed
Steve Carell please!.. one of the funniest actors of all time.
I really thought Ed said afterbirth and my soul lit up thinking he made a the office reference but got disappointed when I realized he said afterburner😪
Y it feel like he still acting for office in this video  lol
Rit dit dit di Doo!
000
Probably one of the most underrated actors in show business
It's egg helms
“This is super fun and cool and….harmful” 😂
well done ed helms... a rockstar ..
Hearing his fake tooth story on how he had it removed to shoot a movie and still go shoot his sitcom with a retainerwas wild lol he's really dedicated
0:50 my brother called me Asbestos Tongue  That's such an Andy thing to say lol got straight B's. They called me Buzz
Watch the Clapper if you haven't seen it yet. He's so sweet in that movie
Since Jenna and Angela have their podcasts, could be fun to have them on. They have a lot of stories to tell.
It's so weird. I tried the last dab sauce in their frozen chicken bites and it was pretty underwhelming. Maybe I just love spicy lol.
They should get the whole main cast of The Office on at once!!
ed did way better than i thought he would
Come on Stewart Price
Samuel L Jackson
Ed didn't seems so pleasant at that very end...   "don't bother".  and great editing to leave that at jem in,.
He actually is Andy Bernard
Use strimp
Get Jim, and Pam together next!
Jon Stewart,  Conan, David Letterman, Colin Quinn,  Jerry Seinfeld
I really like Ed Helms a lot. He is a very pure dude, nothing but friendliness. Probably a great guy to have as a buddy
I always fast forward  when Da bomb appears
Next: Mose Schrute
Now you need to get Steve carell to do this or John krasinski lol
'Don't bother' at the end should be a t-shirt
"This is super fun, & Cool, & harmful." hahahahahahahahahahahahhahaahhahahahaahahhaha underrated episode!
I'd love to know what his next interview was, to see if he was still suffering the after effects or had recovered nicely.
lonesome trio?  they stole name from Airheads.  The Lone Rangers
Now you need to have Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey on.  They have their new book out and they are great together on their podcast.
When is Jason Segel gonna make a hot ones appearance? 🤓
I wonder how his other interview went that day.
Dfh
I ordered the season 17 lineup and it does not have the OG Da Bomb that you have on the show. What’s up wit dat?
What a great guy. So humble and sweet. The way he read the voice over bit at the end when he was clearly on fire! Super professional and he came across really well. I love it when these “celebs” don’t take themselves super seriously. He has a really soothing voice too, he should read audio books.
HOW DID YOU GET TO INTERVIEW AMERICAS FAVORITE 😭😭🥰💕🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Love egg helms
Can we have John Krasinski on Hot Ones?
Uhm.... It's Egg Helms
Thanks again
you can actually tell which ones have the celebrity life of like “GET ME THIS GET ME THAT” vs here where they don’t demand things angrily
All i can hear while watchin hes face is "It was wonderful. I came in you, and you came on the floor."
the nard dogs trying da host wings
I need a mouth hug
Get Lewis Black on!
I love how the guests on the show underestimate Sean and his question asking abilities
Hahaha at the end they offer to pack up the bottles for him and Ed says “don’t bother” 😂
can you please have rainn wilson on
Has Hot Ones considered inviting other YouTube stars, such as Dr Mike, to the show? His sense of humor and medical education could be really interesting to see mixed with this formula.
16:07 I just laughed so  hard lol
Oh my gosh it's EGG helms!
Glad to see rice pudding on the show!
He reminds me of Adam Savage
13:39 HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
Please invite Randall Park onto Hot Ones.
Great interview as always.
Every interviewer on the plant needs to take a note from First We Feast's ability to research and ask the right questions.
Well as a fan of Hot Ones n Ed Helms that was just super enjoyable!! Kudos to you both;)
The Nard Dog!
Ed Helms will read anything after 10 hot wings xD
Banjos are great.  Steve Martin will tell you.
Where is Alan Stu?
Ed Helms is a super nice guy. 10 years ago, I was a mover in LA and he hired us. He fed us, made us coffee (it was a tough job) and tipped us REALLY well. He also hung out after. Went out of his way to be great to a bunch of sweaty shirtless movers.
Ya know, back in the day I had a really hard time liking Andy Bernard. But after watching this interview and seeing how nice and down to earth Ed Helms is makes me appreciate that character so much more.
i like the flaming bottles lol
Magic Johnson is the worst
Aunty Donna on Hot Ones please!
Mr. Helms seems like a genuinely good guy. Definitely funny. Good episode.
An original series?! Hamish and Andy did true stories years ago in Australia!!! C'mon guys!
I would love to do this with my friends, but I don't have any.
i can thank the avett brothers for inspiring me to learn banjo
NARD DOG!!!
Sean just let your hair grow out, it will be a game-changer
I am just going to pretend that this is the "NardDog", and that at the end he ends up in the gutter :D
Loads of great content from the big names in this series and love how people open up and get real under the influence of the spice but just don't get the presenter at all...is he a robot or some kind of AI creation? Does he even taste the food as he has absolutely zero reaction to anything and then just moves on to the next what's your favourite colour question with very little interaction , all a bit strange, must be an American thing?????
Wait, True Story by Hamish and Andy in Australia? They’re doing a us version?
Creed!
Pepcid works against C* 19
Sea Sick Steve!
Remember Turbo Tax lobbying is why you can’t actually file your taxes for free.
Remember Turbo Tax lobbying is why you can’t actually file your taxes for free.
He was not shy about those bites. Good for him!
Does anyone know what interview he does after this one LOL
paging Dr. F_ _ _ _ _
HOW BAD CAN THIS POSSIBLY BE?!
I feel like I only watch these now to see the reactions to Da Bomb beyond insanity, because the two sauces after that are always MEH. You need some stronger sauces on the end run I think.
The Chief Master Sergeant of the US Space Force said he wants to get on Hot Ones👀 Lmk if you’re interested in getting him on
Hangover 4 🥲
I loved Ed Helms's YouTube bluegrass videos during the height of the pandemic. The artists that he had on his show really made me a fan of folk/bluegrass music. I'm glad to see him on the Hot Ones show.
Y’all gotta invite Mufti Menk
Once DaBomb enters the party its always downhill.
He’s an awesome guy. Great interviewee
Nard Dog :)
ALHAMDULILLAH(SWT), ASTAGHFIRULLAH(SWT).
Very Nice Bro! Get Good People!
Give me a break. Break me off a piece of that.... what's it again?
Me and my friends ordered a bottle of DaBomb sauce and it’s literally the worst decision I’ve ever made. It literally just hurts. Taste is horrible and the physical pain I felt is awful. Please never make the same mistake. I watch these videos with a completely different outlook now. Props to everyone that completes these interviews.
Bring the whole cast of hangover on this show! esp Bradley!!!
I want Micheal Scott on this show  Not steve Carrell, Micheal!!!
You just got Nard dogged
“Rit-dit-dit-di-doo”!
Where is MatPat
I could really down spicy foods when I was at Cornell.. they called me "asbestos tongue"
the jon stewart show was the epithome of a jew show.
Get Theo Von!
Mans was leeeaaaking on tha bomb!!
As Martin Short said about hanging out with Steve Martin, "it's all fun and games until the banjo comes out".
So he is having a new show with Jim.
Boiled peanuts for life
Invite Steve Carell please. 🙏🏻🌸
“OH, I CAN TOO JUST SIT HERE AND CRY!!!”
I like how happy Sean is doing this interview
My ulcerative colitis could never
Me love for The Classic is so profound, you can literally put it on anything and it’s so yummy. Such a great sauce 🙌
Egg Helms
He was on vacation
This was the first time I was a little disappointed in the quality of the questions :/
I think if these actors will be asked of the most memorable interview they did, this will go down as their number 1 choice not just because of the twist of eating spicy chicken wings but because of how refreshing and surprising the questions are compared to the generic ones they're used to. Kudos to the team and of course the greatest interviewer of all time my man Sean Evans.
Man, Egg Helms needs to work on his spice tolerance. A producer shouldn't have to deal with this.
Can I request Rashida Jones as a guest!?
Was that the theme from The Rock in the intro?
NARD DOG!
Ed, buddy you keep answering half the question.. Sean, myb ask one at a time. Follow-up questions will make you appear more engaged as an active listener too
we are gonna package up those hotsauces for you to take home...         "Don't Bother"  😂😂
I think Marshawn lynch would be great to see next 🤔👍
Ed really is just the good natured, rational side of Andy Bernard. You can see where he pulled from himself, and where he bumped things up a notch
Has to be the biggest flex to have been in an acapella group! 😤
Oooooo he can sooooo sit there and cry... As much as he wants.
Ed explaining why he was called "asbestos tongue" reminds me of when he'd explain why he was called "buzz", "puke", etc.
Great episode! I would want to be famous just so I could be on this show.
I dont know why but i have the impression that Paul Rudd and Ed Helms would be great friends
Yo is Helms ok? Those bags though
Get Michael Jordan on the show. I love your questions Sean. I would love to hear the thoughtful questions MJ would get from you.
michael scott
I want to see Martha Stewart on Hot Ones :)
Creed! But they have to be in character 🤣
Could you guys try to get Elon Musk on the show !? :)
DA BOMB 16:00 . . .
The "dont bother " at the end got me good
got the season 17 set for my birthday and it was great!
Getting Jim halpert is the obvious next step
Egg Helms*
Ed gave me the "don't you know who I am?!  vibe... am I wrong?
Ed was a super nice guy when I met him at work, didn't want to bother him but had a great convo when he approached looking for products.
I’d like to see Randall Park who played Jim Halpert.
Thought he was Tobey Maguire from the thumbnail lol
He did really good, didn't expect that...lol
Meh.
5:54 it looked like Ed was tearing up cuz Sean brought up that movie
Since you guys do deep dive background checks on your guests, you should get Nardwuar on!!!
I LOVE Hot Ones.  But , here is a spin.  Maybe get regular people .. off the street.. possibly an ex felon that just got out.  And then do a deep dive on their background.  THAT would be cool to watch.  Lol
ANDY
I loved him in the office and the hangover movies. In addition to being very well spoken and sounding super intelligent, he seems to be a down to Earth super nice guy.
Dean winters
Need to have the All-State accident guy. I forger his name. Wait that's what Google is for
He's always Andy to me 😂
"I'm throbbing" -Ed Helms, 2022
I want to become famous just so I can be interviewed on Hot Ones
07:23 "Angry Goat Pepper Company"  Not PAPER COMPANY??  Come on, Prison Mike...
Aww…
yo, can i get ed helm's sauces? I don't have a $120 for the whole pack lol
If I had to pick any actor to play me, it would be Ed Helms.
It’s called bangkok lol
I’d love to see nardwuar on here!
Love the show! Any chance for James or Lars from Metallica, maybe both..?
Nard Dog
Egg Helms
Starting out with nicknames from the old days. "In character"😄
Killed very enjoyable to watch
My husband just gifted me the season sauces for my birthday. I can't wait to try them all...well, I don't know about Da Bomb...lol.
Isn't his name Egg?
HAHA ITS FUNNY BECAUSE HES JUST SITTING THERE AND CRYING XD
Nard dog
Chris Pratt, Chris Pratt, Chris Pratt,  start with him then have on the cast of guardians of the galaxy
Jeff who lives at home is definitely one of my top 5 favs
Which interview did Ed have after this 😂
Kind of feel like we need Hank Green on hot ones....
happy to see baby wa wa doing well.
Dont bother. Lol yup
Egg* Helms
who's idea was it to light the bottles on fire?
What's unique about this show is not the hot sauces, it is the questions that no other interviewer has said.
hasn't ed helms already been on hot ones?
Ed looked more like Greg Kinnear than Ed Helms in the thumbnail.
I was behind him in line at a Coffee Bean a few years ago, and I told him he had a great ass and I wished I could touch it. It was obviously a joke but he got really pissed and looked at me like he wanted to start a fight. I figured he's either a homophobe or has no sense of humor.
Get nardwuar
Did Ed Helms just eat asbestos? 😂
Stu Price
Ed Helms seems like such a nice and genuine dude
dont use that gimpy back ground tune its soo shit its not calming obvs 😂 just talk fuck that weird music
Rainn Wilson
Radiation symbol.. but w/e.. it's not like that isn't common knowledge or anything.. LOL I love da bomb drops.. lol.. He took it like a champ though.
Classic Egg Helms.
Where are your masks? Oh yeah, I forgot that celebrities and the elite are excluded from mask mandates.
I sold Ed Helms some high end outdoor gear once when I was working retail (store was in West LA so celebrities came through with some regularity). Aside from Danny DeVito, Helms was without a doubt the coolest/most down to earth celebrity who shopped there. Just a nice, funny, warm hearted dude.
Speaking on banjos, Steve Martin needs to be on this!
"this is doing permanent damage"  one of the funniest lines I've heard on Hot Ones
that guy is actually Andy Bernard, it was never a character but himself honestly
It’s going to get a little toasty up in here.
Omg it’s Nard Dog!
ellen should get on here
Was that a don’t bother it’s to hot or ?
This was an awesome episode
You should do an episode with John and Rainn from the Office in it
Can we get John and Rainn together on here??
When I was a baby, my mother threw my head into a brick wall.
I really love Creed also and Kevin
“Boner champ!”
am I the only one worried about Shawns long term health doing this show??????
Oh no. Ed is not super fun and cool.
Da bomb starts the downhill slope every time
Thought he was going to give a shout out to Here Comes Treble for a minute there.
We want Jeremy Clarkson.
Harry mack. Get Harry mack on the show
Glad to see Aunty Donna have helped push Egg Helm's career.
I can he has a spice tolerance, not even from eating spicy food but from just having it naturally
Does this guy ALWAYS say "Segway" ....someone teach this man new words.
Imagine if they got all the cast back and recreated some Office scenes but the actors all ate a da bomb wing before action lol
16:10 Stu doing stu things 😂😂😂
Is it possible to order all the hot ones sauces? I wanna try it with my mates (so delivery to South Africa). Does anyone know?
That was a good episode. Congrats Ed
When is you going to invite 50 cent??
Another great episode. Ed Helms is a beauty.
Mouth doctor because dentists ARE doctors
Sean Evans is just a boring host...same boring tone, pitch and style. 💤
The 'We're going to package those sauces for you to take home...'  Ed: 'Don't bother'   I can't wait to watch True Story !
We need Steve Carrell!!!! :D :D :D :D
Egg helms
13 scorpions 🦂 is made in Brisbane Australia 👍
can u get eminem?
Speaking of music... perfect pitch is when someone throws an acordian and hits a banjo player
THE NARD DOG
Love it! HOT ONES Never disappoints!!
I don't think True Stories is an "original comedy series" I believe it was first done by comedians Hamish and Andy in Australia
Oh please... These FX sounds and echos are really ruining it...
Ed took decent bites every time!
No one can deny that Sean is a shit hot interviewer
This comment section is a direct reflection of how wholesome the interaction between these two gentlemen was. Love to see it.
pls invite hyunee eats in hot ones
Bring Justin Trudeau on. Give him beyond insanity every second one. Ask him how he sleeps at night.
You guys are doing so well this season. I love the music and the flame on the hot sauce segues. It just feels like more of an intimate interview. Great job guys!
Ed is too funny
Best hot ones of all time
Hey this dude went to my high school! Westminster in Atlanta Georgia. There are a ton of pictures of him on the walls in the preforming art rooms.
"Are you seriously trying to still do this interview right now?" ...and then he fields the next two questions brilliantly!😆 What makes Ed such a favorite for me is he's the Southern/Midwestern small town guy who has no idea that he's the Southern/Midwestern small town guy. He makes the best of everything. So great. #OberlinOvertones #trustSean
Boiled peanuts!!! OMG, that’s how I got pregnant with my first kid!
Absolutely love Ed... just a stand-up dude.
I’m 99.99% sure that’s not real hair. Come on bro.
🥳 I loved his interview. I truly enjoy the interview.
Steve carrell, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, Rainn Wilson, Angela Kinsey, ellie kemper, all of them
Am I the only one who thinks of Jerry Smith from Rick and Morty every time he speaks?
Would love to hear some Metallica or some something from Black Sabbath I think that's more it's more into the show
What is with the happy go lucky piano music at the end?
The Office might have survived without this guy’s extremely bad Michael Scott impersonation.
Get Emma Chamberlain on the show!!!
Are gonna get joe rogen anytime soon?
Sean, your questions are amazing. You’re just natural at this and deserve any and all attention you get! So original. :)
They not in the same room 😨
I love this guy. Such good vibes
has this guy ever done anything ever that make people say "wow that has ed helms in it, great movie"
JOHN KRASINSKI PLEASE! imagine it
The awkwardness at the end because they couldn’t shake hands was the realest thing I’ve seen on this show
Guys!! It's Egg!
Love him in Tag. such a fun film.
Sean Evans..I know how little this means to you because you're rich now..  I hope you see this.. I'm unsubscribing. I've been a fan since the beginning. You seem to have lost interest in your fans, now just money 🤑 good for you
“Are you seriously trying to do this interview still ???” 😂😂😂😂😂
We need JASON BATEMAN up in here
Jeff Who Lives at Home is one of my favourite movies!!!
I stopped watching these episodes because he always saves a question about the guest's biggest success for when they can't even properly answer it. Get those questions everyone wants to hear out of the way in the beginning, and leave the less popular questions for the hot wings. Can't stand when I wanna hear a guest talk about one of my favourite pieces of theirs and they can't even get more than 10 words out about it 😿😿😿😿
I usually skip to da bomb, it just hits different
That "Oh my god" @16:50 sent me 🤣
When are these guys bringing on Bradley Cooper and Zack Galifianakis?
He should've ended the challenge with a good "rrrruderderderuu"
Nobody eats wings like Stew  , not you , not you   , not you  not Nobody.... like Stew
Ed took it like a champ! Such a great guy!
You forgot to ask the most important question! Is Andy the Scranton Strangler? Wtf!
I want either Steve Carell or John Krasinski to appear on hot ones. Both would be nice, Carell first; to promote minions 2.
Haven't seen Sean struggle thisbmuch in ages! Poor man musta caught a seed.
Did you guys know he went to Cornell??
Also love when they asked if he wanted the sauces boxed up he said don’t bother.
Thought it was funny that Ed didn’t know the difference between the biohazard and radiation symbols 16:04
I love that ad read. I actually didn't know he did that at first.
I've heard of a pimento cheese sandwich and from what I've heard it's delicious
I wish I knew what his next interview was that day! I'd love to watch it!
Oh he can play the banjo? I didn't know that
Actually didn't know Ed Helms used to be on Daily Show and yes I do know Lewis Black. Totally agree he can make the mundane funny.
If you are going to have another person from The Office you have to have THE Steve Carell. It would be a crime not to
Literally Andy Bernard in real life as well lol, y’all need John Krasinski, Quiet Place+Office
Who is this White Grandpa?
8:02 *Bele Fleck has left the chat*
“Don’t bother” 🤣
🎵 And then we're gonna find our best friend Doug and then we're gonna give him a best friend hug....🎵🤣🤣🤣
Have people really not had pimento cheese sammiches??! Toasted is my jaaaam. We ate them ate work in the ice cream and dairy stores I worked at 🤤
Banjos are cool, only because I'm a huge fan of the hurdy gurdy (yes it's a real instrument)
Props to you for such a simple but weird show concept that's been successful. Relaxing and entertaining. One for the books for sure.
I thought it was Egg Helms?! Wtf?!?!
Any! grab the camera guy. I would also like to add. I know your Clive Barker though! That bomb bottle is the big one👇  *The Bomb:* You ate it! Pain Came! 😈 *Guest Tongue:* Who Are You?📣 *The Bomb:* An Explorer in the Further Regions of Experience, Hot ones to some, Bliss too others☠😈
"Tuna, I'm a performer and perform I shall" proceeds to sing a great song beautifully and get every one of the show's fans emotional
Sean is the best English interviewer after Joe Rogan. Hands Down!
What a champion hahaha man I love these interviews. Ed you did it!! 👏💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥
Hahahaha he couldn't get out of there fast enough 😮😂🤣
"Don't bother."
If it's Dr. Jekyll .. we're fine! haha clever
The true pride of Cornell
I may be in the vast minority, but I find it oddly wrong that a grown man would, in a conversation with another grown man, would  would intentionally and seriously use the word "yummy". I mean, you'd expect it in talking with a child - but an adult???
Holy shit shout out to Hamish and Andy who are the og hosts of true story in oz, well done boys
Get jocko!!!
Lol
Wow did they add extra hot sauce this episode lol. Even Sean looked in rough shape
You suck - TexasPoonTappa
Lol the end "don't bother"
I didn't like the taste of Apollo, it wasn't too hot. The chip was way hotter.
Is Shawn wearing a Nike react AF1s ? Those were really good!
Ed's next interview will be done through the bathroom stall door
the nard dog!
I watched the movie "Jeff, lives at home" because of this interview and I really liked it
When he said ow 🤣🤣🤣 For someone who took part of such an iconic show and has inspired so much emotion in so many people hes so humble and genuine....others do far less and lose all common sense ans self-awareness
‘You’re murdering the nard dog’😀 Bring Creed next
Someone probably beat me to it but all I'm gonna say is Nard Dog 357
10:49 still reppin that xterra in the face of the man who finessed it from him
I am so disappointed that you did not ask him about Rutherford Falls.  So much for research
We need joe rogan on this
"We're going to package up those sauces for you to take home" Andy, "Don't bother."
Would love to see Bernie Sanders on the show Sean and crew 🙏🏼👀
Please have Dwight and Michael on together.
I am weed Jesus. Each time you toke this, do so in rememembrance of me.
Its so cool how he plays bluegrass, im actually from the bluegrass state and one of my great uncles i think played with bill monroe so its pretty cool.
You should do one with Danny Trejo!!
"I feel like this is 20 or 30 scorpions" just took me out 😂😂😂😂
Ed Helms is one of those rare famous people who I'd be completely happy to have a drink with
We need Dwight on this though! Like now.
Yes.
Yea Ed!
It doesn't matter how many times I watch this show, when guests reach Da Bomb...I cross my fingers and hope for the best even though I know it's gonna knock them the fudge out!!!
This show reminds me of that one episode of The Simpsons episode where homer drinks the wax then gets so high from the spice he just swallows he ends up on a golf course
"Don't bother." 😅
There's my helping of wholesome entertainment for the day. <3  So... Are there any links to the rest of the press day? :D
ridid did didiw!
They need to coach the people telling the stories on True Story - they need to have them talk to people first and then have those people reframe the story with better words - not scripted, just enhancing the experience
Just one explain that gram....uhhh man such a let down. Terrible... First dislike every on hot ones!
He's so nice 😭
"I can barely feel it" This would be a great opportunity for the Michael Scott quote "that's what she said"
ITS NOT FREAKIN FUNNY
Sean, check your facts!! Everyone knows this man's name is Egg Helms
You guys should get Lewis Black on the show
Why no banjo music in background?
Get seal
Get Randall on the show
Invite Biden. With a little luck its his last meal.
BRING ON TIM CHANTARANGSU AND RICKY SHUCKS!!
"It's doing neurological damage" - Ed Helms
A mouth medic. Isn't Ed Helms a dentist.
We need dwight in character of course lol
I would love to see Lucy Hale on the show!!
I know I'm  late but ED IS STUPID FUNNY EVER SINCE THE OFFICE GOODAZZ SHOW
Watch it around the eyes Sean.
Isn’t his name Egg? Egg Helms?
I love how he smirks while he's waiting for everyone's reaction to da bomb. It is the grossest tasting hot sauce on earth.
I don't wish this kind of pain and suffering on Ed Helms. Andy, on the other hand...
We need another 3 hangover movies!!!
It's Egg Helms tho...
Finally, Egg Helms on the show!!
Ed seems like such a lovely person!! And this is the best show ever 💖
True Story was done by Hamish & Andy years ago, not new and original at this stage?
Here's still hoping for a second season of Aunty Donna
Such a class act. Handled the wings and the interview like a champ.
I was waiting for Broccoli Bob to show up and steal the thunder
If i was on the show i'd swap plates with Sean. I have my doubts he's masochistic enough to eat the full plate every interview.
You should do Jim Carrey next
Wait, at 12:55, did he really just admit to using editing tricks to make guests look dumb?
LMAO ITS ANDY BERNARD
Top 10
❤❤❤
Ed Helms looks like Aaron Rodgers with short hair
Cleaning wings, I respect that
Back in college I used to eat the hottest menu item before a night out. They called me Asbestos Tongue. The I’d go get wicked hammered. My nickname was Puke. I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a few frat parties, polish off a few brewskies, do some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class. Probably would’ve gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced my courses. They called me Ace. It was totally awesome. Got straight B’s. They called me Buzz.
I want Sean's coat. Where can I get this?
He found a shiny
I love Ed Helms so much already and this just solidified it all for me
"Are you seriously trying to do this interview still?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣im dead
"Dom just hover over the button"  Do yall have an emt button???  Thats legit not gonna lie
Ed, what a trooper! His eyes are red, tears pouring down, nose running. When’s the last time somebody was in this much pain?
Yea OK STU
Should ave got him manic on spice and thrown him out the window?
Robert California
Lol either Mindy Kaling or Angela Kinsey would be so great to see on this show. Or try Michael Greyeyes from Rutherford Falls! 😆
Excited to see true story but I wish they could have talked about Rutherford Falls more!! So much love for Ed Helms
At 24:24 they’re talking about how they’re gonna send him home with sauces and he just goes, “don’t bother” lmfao
This show will never not make me hungry
From @4:30 to @16:17 - "...Not at the table, Carlos!"
He looks like a person from the impractical jokers. Lol
His nose was running faster than he did at the celebrity Marathon
Ed, love ya brother!  Shalom!
He really did just sit there and cry
Get Jim or Dwight up next! Golden!
Love the hard pass by Ed at the end on packaging up the hot sauces to go.
His name is Egg Helms not Ed
That was an interesting one. Ed with the snot running down his nose and his eyes practically bleeding but keeping the composure and keeping the professionalism. Wild.
Sean, what did you do to your teeth?? I haven't watched First We Feast in forever, or around when COVID started.
This show is like Nardwuar with super hot wings. Lol i just realized that.  Edit: wait a minute… i just noticed under “Executive Creative Directors” it says “Ryan Dunn”….. did he have a hand in the show before he passed? Cause it wasn’t around back then. It must be a different Ryan Dunn right?
That don't bother at the end!! LOLOL!!!
20:53 is one of Eds best one-liners.
His name is actually Egg Helms. Yeah "great" research dude :-/
*WALL PUNCH* '....that was an OVER reaction...'  Andy Bernard
Lol watching celebs poison themselves is always a good time
Andy Bernarrrrd. Mr. Bernarrrrd.
This interview was off for some reason, Sean was amazing but I felt a rudeness or disconnect from Ed.  Bring back Chris D’Elia!
Nothing about Aunty Donna?!?!?! Do your research Sean
Andy actually make it to the Hollywood
We need Angela Pam Dwight and Daryl on here And nardwuar.
Ed Helms comes across as such a fantastic gentleman in this episode and my respect for him and what he has done has gone up so much. Absolutely loved this episode - kudos to Sean for bringing out the best in all your guests. What a treat!
when i watch hot ones i just wait the moment when the guest gonna say "that a great question " chris evans just kill it
I was really hoping that they'd talk about Aunty Donna's Big Ol House Of Fun 🥺
The mesothelioma bit was the cherry on top I couldn’t stop laughing ! Hell of an interview!
So glad to see Jim and Andy moving on well so many years after the office.
Once again with the great questions. Well done to the Hot Ones Team.
Off topic, but I saw Mary Poppins the other day with my kids, and I thought that if they did a reboot of the movie today, Ed Helms would have been a perfect fit for Bert(originally played by Dick Van Dyke).
Pretty sure Sean has heard ‘great question’ more than any other phrase in his life.
Ed Helms is a legend - Sean is the best interviewer alive on the planet
true story isn't an original show, maybe to american audiences but it isn't original
You realize asbestos is mold it doesn't mean something is hot lol.
Oh that little ending moment, he is so sweet 🥰
"Poignant: evoking a keen sense of sadness or regret." For those like me who had no idea what that meant.
I would love to see Chris Evans on the show.
So great to see Egg Helms
GET SULLIVAN KING ON HERE!!
How has Corey Taylor never been on "Hot Ones"?
The effects of the pain are halirous
I wish this was Andy tho. Shit would be funny as hell. You know he'd go for it with confidence but end up curled in a corner crying. O wait...
Why is nobody able to pronounce his name properly? Egg Helms! So sad that Egg has so used to Ed that he is no longer correcting people
You need to have shaggy and the creep on here
Tell Flatt and Scruggs the banjo sucks  I don't think so
He looks like he's aging by the wing.
Such a good guest to have.
So you just dropped THE bomb
Wish they would have talked about Aunty Donna Big Ol House of Fun
I love you Sean, don’t get me wrong with my previous comment. I was just wondering.
Did Sean Evans get dentures or change his teeth in some way??
Damn, Ed is even sweeter and more authentic than I could have ever imagined.
Love this guy
ed just summarized "a cappella" in the most connotatively accurate manner that i've ever seen. i think that society dotes on talented vocalists in a way that doesn't justify the skill (underlining that it IS skill, which = hard work + talent, and the bar is high) necessary to break into stardom. naturally, a group of all vocalists will come off - maybe only to those who understand how creepily disproportionate singer-worship is - as trite and self-aggrandizing. but singing - hopefully to anyone who tries it - IS so much fun. like honing any other instrument, folks who spend time learning how to be a vocalist in a group will find that a cappella is just really fucking fun.
It always amazes me how intelligent and well composed these A-List celebrities are on your show. They come off as so human, it's refreshing. These people really do deserve to be where they are in life. I think we get caught up on judging them on the characters they portray. Really great people. Thank you Sean.
I've ate that "da bomb" sauce a couple of times.  It's not that bad, but I was pretty drunk, which probably helped a lot
Itd be nice to see people sit at the same table again instead of putting two tables together for the camera
Even Evan got kicked with that the bomb Wing!!!
It's the nard dog
Please make, “caution around the eyes” with that exact font and logo, a hoodie please. Would buy ASAP.
Nard Dog!
You should add Steveos hot dance because season
Bet your ass that was a great question. They pride themselves on getting that reaction on this show.  😉
Ayoooo I knew he did the voice for that 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Great interview
So disrespectful not calling him by his true name: Egg Helms.
Wow. Ed's a beast!
Please get Shaun White
Can we please have Jim carrey on next?
They show make one with Adam Sandler
Zach Galifianakis in future maybe?
We need vin diesel in this show😂
Can we get any how I met your mother actors on hot ones pleaasasee
Best interviewer ever!
I’ve have a weakness for prostitutes… all kinds apparently
You guys don't need to be 6ft part anymore it's cool bro
The Nard Dog 🐕
What's andy doing here?
Idk why I didn't know he was from ATL
you should have emma chamberlain on this show!!!
Adults shouldn't say "yummy" while speaking to other adults.
Ed Helms.... Wrecked.
So, I know contact high was a thing right. But contact spicy?? Every episode I get red cheecks and a sweaty forehead
Why no mention of the nard dog?
Omg I love him
Da bomb needs to be the last dab already. It's been established.
The current 2 people I would love to see are Tom Hardy and Michael Peña
Is no one going to mention how high this man is!?!?
Where's Nardwaur at?
“Oooh! Chocolate!!”😂😂😂
Gotta get Rob O’Neill on the show
Stüssy force 1s Sean. I got the black ones
We’re gonna pack up the hot sauces for you to take home, Lol. Ed, don’t bother!
Am I the only one that thinks the audio is incredibly loud?
The Helmster.
Telling you it’s time to have mat pat on the show
Sean is absolutely the "That's a good question." king. How many times do we have to hear his guests remark "Wow! That's an incredible question." "No one has ever asked me that before." "Where did you dig that up?" and so on to set this man on the interviewer pedestal where he belongs. There has to be some award, right? I would loved to have seen the interview Ed was going to do afterwards.
does anyone know if I could buy hot one's hot sauce from a local store like Walmart?
Hey! I work with mesothelioma law cases. I watch these to get away from work!
I don’t know why I hate Andy, but I love watching him suffer
Don't Do TV But The Show Sounds Great... Thinkin' Outside The Box🎯
Ok but Jim Carrey on this show tho , omg.
This guy Andy single handedly came and ruined office- well for me
gotta get some prominent youtubers on here.  maybe start with #WhoIsMatPat .
Hey man I have a great idea. Make a hot sauce using the hottest hot pepper in the world after Carolina Reaper, “Dragon’s Breath”. If you do that, I will 1000% subscribe to your channel right now!
Such a nice person.
Breakkk me off a piece of that first we feast
No disrespect but he's an awesome secondary but was never a star primary.
I love the way Ed Helms just fucked off when he was done.....What a professional.
Merry and Pippin for Hot Ones. Perfect timing because they have an active podcast
Boo turbotax!
The ad read really completed the _watching tv way too late at night_ vibe for me. This was a really great episode.
The Nard-dawg
*Get ReviewBRAH on!!*
Wow I'm impressed that he didn't mention that he went to Cornell even once
You spelt his name wrong, it's Egg, not Ed.
O  N E Of the best 👌
You should have on Joe Manganiello on your show.
Hey, how about you invite Matt Stonie? He is a competitive eater and has a world record. It would be great if we can have a non-celebrity in the show.
The sound effects are always the best 😂
you dont deserve to be here if you didnt catch the reference at the beginning
Amazing! Lmao such a great interview
Steve Carell and rainn wilson
the ad copy voice over killed me lol
Sean Evans is the GOAT when it comes to the questions he asks his guests. Not to mention, he lets them talk!
lol his banjo response was pretty funny seeing how good he shreds on it.
Ed Helms eats wings like a weak rabbit.
Imagine if they got Elon musk
You have to get Nardwar the human serviette
Andy Andy Andy… what would Mr. Bernard think??
Dann he's such a good comediant, also heat keep them honest
I’m not going to lie,  this interview technique is genius because it brings everyone to one level.
I died when Ed wiped the last dab off of that last wing, he gave up.
We need to see Sean and Nardwuar interview each other during Hot Ones. Both are great!
Ed Helms is awesome. Zac Galafinakis or whatever the fuck his name is, is garbage comedy for dipshits. I personally think Ed Helms would have been much better without ever being associated with him.
He seems cool. Hopefully nobody puts his stapler in jello
The Nard dawg went in!
thought this was josh peck
great guest a real person
🤣🤣🤣 He should have been forced to do this whole thing as Pablo Chacon 🤣🤣🤣 Or at least  “Just a smidge” 🤣🤣🤣
I got straight As. they called me asbestos tongue.
Such a great interview.  The back stories are everything. Right on folks. Great viewing. This one had me howling.
I love Egg Helm. He’s great
i can’t believe they made an american version of true story with Hamish & Andy 😂 what world we living in
1:32 um excuse me I thought it was a chicken wing?
It getting to anyone else that Sean’s table isn’t level?
Please add Dave Portnoy to Hot Ones. He seems sort of wimpy with hot sauce, but it would be cool to see him with Sean.
How about bringing BTS onto Hot Ones??!!
Love Egg's work
Bring John H. Benjamin to the show
Hyped because it wasn't focused around his office position the whole time. I think Ed appreciated that too every question seemed to make him pretty happy too
*Egg helms
Another awesome episode! Ed's such a humble and genuine guy. Cool!
OMGoodness! We have the Insanity brand and that one is a BITCH, My friend!! Mean, MEAN, MEAN 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Why was he salty because of the 10second plug lol
Wow, now I know where I’ve heard Ed Helm’s voice before! 😆 I’ll call that 800 number now ☝️.
John Krazinksi
This was so wholesome. I love the researched questions. I can't wait to see a guest like Neil Patrick Harris on here. His instagram/twitter dive would be hilarious.
this would make me want to never eat hot wings again lol. You know how you eat something and get sick and never want it again….yup
why don't they clean the bone...smh pure amateurs
Love this guys acting. He steals the entire movie just by being in it.
That was great! I’m glad this show is still going.
hey guys can i get sountrack? 11:00 i''d like to hear at full volume ;)
Absolute best celebrity interviewer. Best questions for the best personalities.
I'm 65 years old and pimento cheese sandwiches have always been a part of my life. So it really surprised me to hear a question about pimento cheese, like it was something foreign.
24:57 That's what she said
he just seems like chill dad
Peanuts you wanna talk about nuts right now?! “Wow that is so brutal” hilarious greT show guys n gals keep up the solid work
Why don't they use a rectangular table rather than two circular ones?
I see you Ed. Wearing redwing 1907 moc toe  boots.
We need Jason Segel!  He is a artistic mastermind
It’s so disappointing to see you still doing the most ridiculous “social distancing” social conditioning 🤦🏻‍♂️ For as smart as we thought you were, you have no idea about what mass psychosis is, do you? Nor your participation in it? Just go back to normal for sanity’s sake!
Nard dog!
This is easy Bring. It. On.
Please put Will Arnett
Petition to have Rick Astley on hot ones. ⬇️
Ed Helms is so funny as the "Bad Guy" in The Goods.  On par with Stiller in Dodgeball.  Such a funny guy!
please please pLEASE have Jason Bateman on – that would be killer
Ed's the man!!!!
Nard dog
Where’s the part where they show pictures that need more context?
Andy Bernard is really bossing it!
Invite Rainn Wilson onto the show!
Ed helms is naturally funny without even trying.
there really should be links to the following interviews when guests have those after :D
Hahaha  We are going to package those things up.... Don't Bother..LOL
Haha the slightly different "say it ain't so" music in the background at the beginning
Guys you should totally get Matthew Mercer on this.
we are going to box up those sauces for you... Dont bother.. lol
i thought this guy's name was Egg Helms
Ed’s taking huge bites!!
The Nard-Dog sweating it out! 🤣I love it! Everyone who eats these wings makes me want wings but not the sauwce.
If you've never had a fried bologna and pimento cheese sandwich. You're missing out!
Thats not Ed Helms, that is Egg Helms
How did he handle the last sauce so well?🤣
Why Andy Bernand is trying to be someone else ?
Dam he didn't age well lmfao🤣 Just like me🤣
I'm not sure what the story is behind it, but did they rip-off true story from Hamish and Andy which was made back in 2017 in Australia
I can't believe he has another interview after this. He might have cancelled it. Hahaha
So glad to see Ed on the show, love his work
YES!!!!!! Dude so in my house every birthday that person chooses what we eat for dinner.  I have wanted to go on your show because I literally eat the hottest sauces in the world its a little ridiculous but I'm not a celebrity so noway I'm ever gonna make it on the show so on my birthday the past 2 or 3 years we do our version of it and boy you of all people know eating ridiculous hot stuff on the regular pales in comparison to starting mild and going hot because then you realize just how hot the stuff is but it's fun and now I can't wait for August this year totally buying that
Omg they got Steve Haines from GTA V on the show!
He looks like dude that can pull off a Mike Tyson face tattoo
Let’s switch this for a bit why doesn’t Kevin Hart asked questions to the rock instead.
We need Ted Lasso on the show!
Love the flaming bottles for this season's bottle close-ups, but I think it'd be really cool to just have a slow-mo shot of you guys smashing them with a sledgehammer. Feel like it would really encapsulate the desires your guests have in the moment...
“I’m not gonna fuck a tradition” 🐐🤣🔥
creed but in character
Egg Helms is defiantly a pretty cool dude
This was a really good episode.
Roo doot doot doo doo
DEFINITELY one of those episodes, you KNOW the guest was feeling it. Handled it like a champ.
Next has gotta be Rainn Wilson and Steve Carrell
ed helms is basically jerry from rick and morty
You've got to get keanu reeves on this show!!
What shoes is Sean evans wearing? I know they’re air forces but I can’t find the color/texture.
Get Nardwuar on here and he and Sean can interview each other!
"Are you seriously trying to have this interview right now?" lolol
Ed Helms never looks the same in any pictures. Always looks like some other guy. haha
I just noticed the flame on each bottle. Is that new or am I just ultra-nonobservant? 🤔🙈
could have sworn his name was egg helms
This feels so full circle seeing him thriving, since I just finished watching The Hangover Trilogy, what a cool coinkadink🤠✨
I really hope they never get rid of Da Bomb. It's been in the lineup forever. It's usually the real turning point for guests as far as heat, and it's also hilarious how disgusting everyone finds it!
Who doesn’t love Ed! Great guy and actor
I am not famous in any way. I probably have nothing to give when it comes to rating or in this case views. But what do I need to do to get on this show?  Screw the show, Sean can you hook me up and let me do a challenge with you?
I'm here! 😎 Great video, just posting a comment to show some support! Keep up the good work. 🤙
this was so wholesome!
Wow a guest thanking the show for having a good time
Poor Ed!! He’s sweating under his eyeballs!!!
Can we do a hot ones for dom?
That’s Egg Helms
gj, you are honored.
what a stand up guy.
When I was in college, I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was "Puke." I would chug a fifth of So-Co, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, boot, rally, more So-Co, head to class. Probably would have gotten expelled if I'd let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses. They called me "Ace." It was totally awesome. I got straight B's. They called me "Buzz."
hear me out i just thought of this, but you guys should auction the sauces used in each episode and donate the money to a foundation that the guest choses!!
those are the wierdest fuckign ears i've ever seen.
Great interview 🙌🔥🔥
Hot ones restaurants  coming soon  at least I hope there is  I will be a hit
Wow!! This was a great interview! This might be the best season of Hot Ones so far!
LOL he brought out the roots with that ad read lol fantastic
Cool guy, terrible actor.
Hahahahahahaha.. "Don't bother!"
Peacaulk
"are you seriously trying to do this interview still???"
get Tom Brady on here!!
I already have peacock n i will watch your show
He's really popping on screen
I love getting Ed.
Get Protoje on this shit
Y’all should get David Goggins!!!
Doesn’t Sean always do the explain that gram segment? Or does it depend on the interviewee?
Nardwuar vs Shawn
Love Egg Helms
First episode of this season and Sean’s first question already got answered with “that’s a great question”. This is gonna be a great one!
Why are there several different copy/pasted comments in here from different people?
He was looking for the bathroom and people harrased him all the way lol.
Can I mention the flame on top of the bottle is totally not needed? Like I get it cute but you don’t need it for the show. It honestly distracts me from seeing the hot sauce and I miss what level he is on.
heard he's got a stellar rig
It's Egg, not Ed.      If you got that reference, your a champ.
Ed Helms is the man
Whoa... Sean's at the ropes this time :O
What a champ
God, he seems so down to earth! I love that ☺️
THE NARD DOG
The Lady: " We are going to package up some hot sauces for you." Ed : "Don't bother." 🤣🤣🤣
My brain can’t separate him from Andy lol
Ed, your ok for a white guy..  lol.
i know steve-o will ignore these signes
He’s like your wacky neighbor not the most “holy wow I can’t believe you went through that” just if a suburban night was a person
If they ever do a movie about Antony Burdain he would be the perfect actor to play him.
He spent the rest of his day clenching his butt cheeks through more interviews.
Believe it or not last year Sean did a Hot-ones-style interview with Cornell's Vice president over zoom. Now he's interviewing our biggest icon from the office 🤣
jack black
Get Pat McAfee On Here !
I always want to know what interview they have afterwards so we can see how that went!
“This are coming out of my mouth and I can barely feel it.” Sounds like a Lana Rhoades said.
I've always wondered, how exactly is the hot sauce applied to the wings? I mean they're always these dry and cold wings.. how is it done so the little amount is spreaded equally? When I do my wings and in most  restaurants where I go, they're swimming in the sauce. Of course not as hot sauce as the hottest presented here.
Ed must be a tennis player, this dude loves throwing topspin on things
Good job Ed.  After the 2nd wing I really thought you were headed for disaster.
Woo another episode ruined by obnoxious background music
He has a new show with Jim from the Office?!? Thats awesome!
He got his Acapella group name wrong...it was Here Comes Treble!
just go to 16:00
you should do a season with Trinidad and Tobago Hot Sauce Berties ! its delish!
Sean, not your best performance today, hope everything is ok.   Ed was fantastic, struggled through it for sure.  Fun episode overall
Ed looked better after wing ten than he did after wing 2 lol. He closed it in style.
Great video.
Love to see Micheal Rosenbaum on the show aka Lex Luthier from Smallville. Great guy and think he’d play this up so well
HOT!
Boiled mfkn peanuts are the best.   Cheddar cheese and spice make the best pimento cheese.
I love that guests still go into da bomb completely unaware.
Can we get Jared Keeso on here??
Wow! I can’t wait to watch that show with Andy and Jim!
Another great episode with great questions!
Lol you almost killed Ed
This is one of the best ones lol I am from Alabama and I love boiled peanuts and my dad plays the banjo (poorly) 😄
I feel like the flames on top of the sauces just distracts from the label on the sauce. Kinda takes away from the impact. Idk maybe it’s just because it’s new
Low key my celebrity crush, along with Bob Odenkirk.
please BRING THE JACKASS FOREVER CAST TO DO THE WINGS.
i know he was on a time schedule, but he definitely seemed ready to get out of there. Just the way he told them not to bother to pack up the sauces sounded like he was done.
I love Ed, hearing him talking about pimento cheese sandwiches. Seeing his tears and hearing his voice makes me feel he lost his best friend, who was a pimento cheese sandwich.
Sean flying faster and faster through the “explain that gram” intro
Why not, "The Hot Box"? Pretty sure that's what awaits anyone who takes that journey.
Tell me Ed Helms has heard of Billy Strings? This kid is reinventing Blue Grass. https://youtu.be/jCf3nmSo1XY
Get Taylor Swift for the love of god
THE NARD DOG‼️
He will always be Drew in my eyes.
Hello
Another banger
Ed Helms is great but we need the Sudeikis-Lasso hot ones trip, it could be a whole Ted Lasso special tbh
Steve, Creed, Phyllis
Are those Thursday boots you're rockin there, Ed Helms? Those look exactly like a pair I have (Diplomats in Arizona Adobe) and I love them. 0:56
anyone think the music is kinda of annoying
Ed "Asbestos Tongue" Helms. His moniker is longer than his name. 🤣 Great episode!
Love him great guy you’re awesome
the fucking MESOTHELIOMA ad LMAOOOOOOO
Been a while since that level of snot has flowed.
Me and some friends did the challenge using season 16 sauces, and that Da Bomb is the one that got everyone. That shit is dangerous... Emotional Damage.
☢️ It's for radioactivity, biohazard has its own symbol ☣️
What a cool guy. Clearly super smart, and real, dude!
To much background noise (music) and enough with the reverbs....
i never noticed bro had that mole on his nose
For the last time, it's EGG Helms! I can't believe people are still getting this wrong in 2022.
My mouth salivates so much every time I watch this show
If I’m not mistaken this true stories show was already done by Hamish and Andy…
ROO TOO TOO TOO TOO TOOOOOO
True Story? No love to Hamish and Andy? K
Oh I forgot he was on the office sounds funny but sign of a great comedic actor, he was awsome in the office.
Robert California!
This show isn't as good with all the silly covid virtue signaling. Just sit at one table with the guest like the first ten seasons please.
Hot Ones Classic is an insult to hot sauce. I'd ask for my money back, but I already threw that shit away.
Don't bother...shoot I will take them!!!
AYOOOOO GET DWAYNE THE ROCK JOHNSON ON HERE. Let's see if he can still keep that smoulder after eating these wings 😉
i know this is out of nowhere - but i need to put in the request...NICOLAS CAGE PLEASE 😎
Great episode. Can we please have a Nardwaur vs Sean episode? Ultimate deep cut question battle...
Love the new teeth Chris!!! They're HUGE!!!!
The more I watch these, the more puzzled I become. I don't understand why people don't watch this before they agree to be on it? Even if you only watch a few, you will be prepared at least a little bit. Them not knowing about the last dad and da bomb after 200 something episodes is truly confusing.
Will Arnett would be awesome to see on here... 🔥
Wow, & no milk as far as this showed. 👏
What a great guy. Nice show, Sean
The mesothelioma plug XD LOL!!!
Man ed helms can handle his spicy food!!
This is garbage. Sean needs to be shown eating his wings and they focus too much on the celebrities. Figure your shit out because this is bad.
He seemed stand offish at the end... kinda like he only did this for exposure. After personally trying da bomb myself... Im hugging whoever did it with me!!!
Ed Helms has Dick Van Dyke energy - rare to find these days.
"Oh, I can so just sit here and cry."  Ed Helms
homie kinda looks like jerry from rick and morty
21:04 nose drippin, brow is sweatin, but the bigg balls come out
ABSOLUTELY LUV HIM A GOAT!!!😘❤
hey guys im funny
had no idea jeff who lives at home was improve that blows my mind bc its such a good movie. also I think Ed Helms just set a new record for last dab drops lmfao wow.
Pat McAfee next please!!!!
I'd like to see the footage of him in the interview he had to do after this...
I think one of the background music is the “find out best friend Doug” song
I've had every Last Dab. The last one is the tastiest, hands down. It is very hot. It is half as hot as the first Last Dab.
Get chris bumstead on here
wow oh wow, the whole tooth thing is just amazing. crazy dedication, i wonder the ep. of OFFICE he did with that. lloool. luv this . shoutout to maker's mark rn rf rf  :P
They all say "great questions' dude... Best interviewer out there
kind of embarrassing they got Egg's name wrong the entire time
its time you get NARDWAUR!!!! ON THE SHOW!
One redeeming thing about the banjo. Steve Martin plays it, and he makes it sound good. I will always remember his stand-up routines where he played it on stage.
LA BEAST needs to do an episode with only the hottest sauces on the wings
Okay Sean! I see you in your jeggins sis lol
I want to sit down and talk blue grass with helms so bad
The nard dog is suffering, hey oh!
10/10 guest, Ed was great!
"Don't bother." - Ed Helms
Never get tired of this. Just brilliant. Cheese and pimento!! so forgot about that, as basic as PB&J.
Pablo chakone
You want to hear cool Banjo, check out Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. You're welcome.
He's still Andrew Bernard. You can't convince we otherwise.
I busted out laughing in the first 2 seconds
Finally a guest who knows what the Last Dab is
Lol i hate a capella music
Awe I really really like Ed!
The odd part is that Sean and the team do such a great job on the deep dive on obscure information on the guests but they can't even give full answers to the questions because they are in so much pain from the sauce.
Thus far the best 'da bomb' reaction/trooper.
It’s actually Egg Helms…
Such a darling
I just became a big fan of Ed!
I’ve seen him in so many things over the years. Never once learned his name until today 🤣🤣😂🤣
Dang didn't know he went to Oberlin college in Ohio. That's literally 30 minutes from my house. That's awesome.
is this colbert's brother?
He one of my favourite actors in tag
Feel like his authenticity is fading, they’re probably just putting restrictions on him now
Which “Da Bomb” comes in the gift pack?
Dabomb is a horror liquid brought from the depths of hell.
get kodak black on here
Impressive.. most Impressive
I would love to see nardwuar here on hot ones
we need some close up shots of sean putting the sauce on his wings too
i think Ed's brain just exploded inside his skull on Da Bomb.  Gushing
Why does Sean Evans look like he only eats one bite? Unlike most people on here taking 2 or more bits!
Get Bradley Cooper or Zach Galafanakis next! That would be awesome!
I cackled at the Banjo answer.
Ed Helms! Please cast me on True Story! My life is hella interesting! ✨👏😎
Now I'm cracking up that Ed Helms wasn't playing banjo in the Hopeless Wanderer video and reveled in the bashing of the banjo so much.
Him saying ow and that he has another interview afterwards is insane I need to see that other interview
Alan Ritchson as Jack Reacher is honestly the best thing. Ive seen him as young Thad in blue mountain state turn into the absolute UNIT he is now. I would love to see him do this interview becauae Sean would come up with some amazing deep dive questions I'm sure and ill bet Alan would be hilarious as he took on the wings of death.
I hate to correct you, but I'm pretty sure it's Egg Helms
They need to start putting the wing number on the screen when they show the sauce or something because I can never keep track of which number they're on. happens almost every time
Class act, both of them! And he handled those wings like a champ.
Lol Sean was so happy to let him walk into da bomb. Lol. Gotta do some research Ed, lol, hot ones is a big show.
Egg
I love Ed Helms! He looks like McLovin all grown up! 😁😁😁
I want to see Jared Padalecki!!
im going to honest and say the background music was pretty bad, it took away from the interview alot more then it gave to it.
I love the music change at 3:11 HAHA! People never learn, they always get cocky after the first one.
Ed is right. I watch ones just for the questions he asked. His questions are amazing. It's what carries the show.
Ed Helms is slowly morphing into Dylan Baker.
Guys,i wanna see Zlatan Ibrahimovich on the show! Pls invite him! I wanna see tough man crying like a baby🤣
Best thug life wing moment lmfao
How have I never heard anyone say "my nose is sprinting" before? Seems like an obvious one but it caught me off guard lol
And this is why Da Bomb is never the last Sauce... It stops down any function for a few Minutes!.. Its Always #8 for How many season?
He didnt break out a little hangover jingle I'm dissapointed
I don’t get it, how did Olivia Rodrigo do so well with the wings when she isn’t good with hot sauce. And then some do bad with the wings who are fine with hot sauce
"Don't bother" 😆
😘😘😘😘😘😘🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
His name is actually Egg Helms. They spelled it wrong on here.
Now bring on the Aunty Donna boys!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH 😂😭🤣
How did Ed get all the way to the helm of this episode???
He got choked up with the Jeff @ Home question
great guy
Hastiest exit from the show award goes to Ed Helms.  "Thanks for having me. Great questions.  Gotta go blow these chicken wings out my butt now."
We gotta get Sullivan king  on hot ones
i love that he seems like such a nice guy in real life.
Great interview, and good job by Ed powering through.   The last exchange was great; 'Hey we're going to package up those .. for you.. Don't bother."
Can we get a Sean after hot ones episode? Like what does Sean do for the rest of his day with a burning hot mouth, up to burning hot but hole. Poor guy does this all the time episode ends, but! But the heat doesn’t… would be very interested to see a special on that. Thanks
https://youtu.be/gjvNNqKnUHM
I’m waiting for the movie where Ed Helms plays a homely dad who goes on a murderous rampage after his kid is kidnapped…the gritty, dramatic turn is begging to happen with him
Mouth medic More like Stu the Dentist
Sean Evans = Nardwaur With Hot Sauce
good  dude
Since The office I have always thought very good about Ed, and this is the first interview I see from him, and now I know why I felt that
2:30 I do agree with that, I mean my father made the three humped camel joke hilarious. Mainly because he was talking to a phone spammer who sounded middle eastern or Indian idk 🤷‍♂️ he was just messing with the dude and my father just blurted it out in the most hilarious way possible. My father just has that nack to make everything ten times funnier then the original way they are said. I mean I took a bit of that from him which I find awesome, unusually it’s me just taking people criticism of me and turning it into a huge joke. For instance at my current job everyone’s making fun of me for ordering Ford F-350 and one of my coworkers said recently to me “this is why you bought an F-250, cause you like to take ducks!” And my comeback was “well jokes on you I got an F-350, that’s 3 times the dicks!” Lol 😂 all in good fun though lol 😂 I mean I could of gone on to say “well my gay uncles boyfriend drives a Cummins!” Which oddly enough is true but my manager is a Cummins guy. Lol 😂 didn’t feel like getting fired. 🤷‍♂️
Awesome
Damn this dude has aged like a hot wing cooked way too long 😬
Omg I would want Will Forte on this show so bad!!!!!!!!!
Andy!😃❤️
Man they dunked  that Da'BOMB wing for sure.... Shit got real fast when that one came round. Looked like the last two sauces didn't event register.... funny stuff
I'm pretty sure it's Egg helms guys...
Ed did not seem so happy at the end, he clearly enjoyed the questions asked in the interview but not the whole experience.
Ok... now I am just waiting for the REMAINING CAST MEMBERS TO SHOW UP ONE AT A TIME, TO EAT THE WINGS OF DEATH! THE FIRST TWO i WANT TO SEE IS JOHN KRAZYNSKI AND MINDY KALING... just to get things rolling!
Are those some AF1 coffees I’m seeing right now?
All these episodes later and Sean's only 5% less robotic.
19:46 that's what she said
I have a question: Are the chicken pieces drowned in de sauces, or do you put just a drop on it, as it is presented to your guests? Keep up the show, I am one of the biggest fans!!
Nard Dawg
Ra da da da doo
Spicy chilli is very bad for blood type A people
Sean: are those coffee stained Nikes??
I'm really sorry for the interviewer that had to interview Ed after Sean. Sean is simply incredible
Sean took a hit on this one, this one was tuff on him!
I love egg helms.
Ed Helms looks like he's been awake for a month
What a cool down to earth guy
He looked blasted from the start
We need florence pugh!
It's egg helmes
Andy eats chicken wings
No Ted Lasso conversation??
He looks exactly how I imagine Jerry from Rick and Morty would look like if he was irl :D.  Anyway, amazing episode!
How are people still getting his name wrong? It's *Egg* Helms...
I always wonder what interviews they’re doing after this one so I can see the result and if they’re struggling or not later on in the day 🤣
24:24 "Dont bother" hahahaaaaa
I thought his name was Egg Helms…
Name does not fit this guy.   Who is Ed Helms and what has this guy done with him?
When will we see HotOnes Aloe Vera toilet paper?
redeem banjo check out Willow Osborne
Banjo at 7:49 is aight
peacocks are cool
Would love you to do eddie Murphy or joe rogan or adam sandler
Goddamn Andy you got old boy.
Ed Helms not realizing how awesome he is for playing banjo breaks my heart.
Bring the rhcp guys to the show!!
I like this dude^^♡
DO NARDWAUR
Andy Bernard ladies and gentlemen 👏👏👏
"We're gonna package those sauces for you."  Ed- "Don't bother." great ending!
So whats the lesson about beginning in comedy that he had to learn the hardway?
I think this is the hardest I’ve ever seen Sean hit with Da Bomb. But also, Ed Helms took that like a champ.
I hope the researchers on this show get paid A LOT of money. 😂 😂
That was the Davies and Main ad from better call Saul!
"We're gonna package those sauces for you."  Ed- "Don't bother." great ending!
love his character on Harold on Kumar 2 shits hilarious
Sean Evans tackles a gazelle in this episode
Andy Bernard is one of my all time favourites.
Great episode!!!
Hands down Steve Carell. Like, that man just needs to be on this show regardless.
It’s funny, but when Ed Helms took that big bite out of the “Da Bomb” wing, I said “Ohhhhhhhhhh Andy” 🤣
Don't bother!
I recognize what’s happening at the end there on Ed’s way out. My man is trying to be chill, buuuuut where’s um restroom coolcoolcool um I’m just gonna pop in thanks
Glad he says pea-NUT instead of Pea-NIT like most people in the Mid West / West say. idk why I hate that haha
Holy 💩 he plays 🪕 jimmy crack 🌽. Phenomenal!! 💣 😂😂
Great job 👏
The original hot ones sauce is not good. I’m not sorry about it.
Rutututurruuuuuu
Humble request for Jason Sudeikis to face the spice.
Lame.
Not a fan of the background music.
So when do we get to see Sean Evans and Jon Stewart on the same show?
Should have gotten him some spicy tuna
Parkour! Parkor! Parkour
Ed seems like a really nice guy.
dont you mean Egg Helms?
Mike Tyson would be a wild interview on here.
Please reach out to Brandon herrera and demolition ranch and have them on hot ones. I guarantee you'll get a ton of views.
The Fire Shooting at Us🤣🤣🤣
True story isn’t an original show, it is the American version of Hamish and Andy’s show in Australia which has been around for a few years
Right On!!! I got hot ones season 16 for Christmas. It’s honestly not that bad, but I also eat extremely hot stuff. The flavors are amazing though. Also I something about this episode made me want to cry happy tears. It is really a beautiful interview.
Only the Bomb shook him
Asbestos mouth? More like Ass best of mouth
In my Dwight Schrute voice: "Michael!" 🤣
i wanna know  what his next interview is. I bet he was a mess... ANyone know what was up next for him lol
Everybody's saying how mean Ed was during this and how awkward this was, I thought it was great!!! Ed's a pro 😊
I hoped he’d at least rips his tooth out 😅
I can't NOT feel like it's The Nard-Dog talking
Oh wow, he really is Andy Bernard even irl
Riditditdido
So his new show is a podcast
I can't take it anymore! GIVE THESE GUESTS SOME MORE FUCKING NAPKINS JESUS CHRIST.!!! HOW MANY FUCKING SEASONS IS IT GONNA TAKE FOR YOU TO FIGURE THAT OUT. YOU WANR THEM ABOUT TOUCHING THEIR EYES OR FACE AND YET U WATCH THEM WIPE THEIR FACE AND BLOW THEIR NOSE WITH THE SAME NAPKIN! ITS DRIVING ME CRAZY AND ITS HONESTLY INCONSIDERATE. ALSO SEAN NEEDS TOGROW A PAIR OF BALLS AND KEEP REMINDING THEM! SOMETIMES HE SAYS IT JUST ONCE AND SOMETIMES NEVER AT ALL.
I swear, if this guy talks lib, I am out...Annnd, he didn't! Sweet, just as cool as I hoped he would be! No preaching lib BS. Awesome episode! 🤘😁
Really surprised that the napkins aren’t white and fuzzy soft. You could see where you wiped the hot sauce by the color on the towel.
Can you get Nardwuar on next?
please try and get dave grohl on the show he can promote studio 666 and he’s so funny
Of all the episodes of Hot Ones I've ever seen, I think Ed is the closest to how I'd fare doing the wing gauntlet. My nose and eyes would be gushing, I'd be fighting off Panic Mode and the brain would be racing. I'd hope I would do as well as him and make it to the end. Wish I got a shot to do it. It was a good interview, Ed did great and I like him more for having seen it.
Steve, Rain, John K, and CREED hahaha i would love them
I wish Disney make the Simpsons live action. Ed Helms perfect for principal Skinner
I was browsing Instagram while watching this and when I came across a pic of someone putting their hand on their face, I immediately thought "Careful around the eyes!" 😆
Wake me up when we get there.
I feel like Sam Elliot and/or Robert De Niro would be perfect for this. Idk why, I just get that feeling.
The aunty donna boys should come on the show
“My nose is ‘sprinting’” did he mean “spritzing” or is that an Andy joke?
#SashagreyonHotOnes
That was great.
Might as well put debomb on spot 1. The best questions and answers happen there. Also it's funnier to see the guest struggle to do their plug after the actual hottest sauce.
Love Ed Helms and he is hilarious.
My favorite moment of Andy Bernard is when he's singing Take a chance on me to Angela. He was so sweet when he first appeared on the show
Didn't know Ed plays the Banjo. Now I would love to see Ed play with another famous Banjo playing comedian......Billy Connelly!
Cant believe you got egg’s name wrong
I wonder if he walked off stage, and just sharted, pure flames? 😢😢😢
first off guys dont drink water it makes it worst drink milk or lemonade
I can’t wait to give birth next month so I can enjoy my Hot Ones box my hubby got me for Xmas!!!😭😭😭
I absolutely adore Ed Helms. He’s one of those people you’d want to have a coffee with.
He looks so old now :(
Ed was one of the funnier guests I’ve watched. May need to watch his new show for sure!
Andy is looking great!
Ed Helms? I think you mean Egg Helms
da bomb is built differently
I would honestly love to see everyone from the office on this show
I've never seen Ed in any interviews or anything, but man he just seems so genuine and likable. I used to think he was a bit much in the Hangover, but the more I see of Ed, the more I've come to really appreciate him. He seems like someone I'd love to just have a casual dinner with and shoot the shit. Thanks First We Feast & Sean for always allowing us to see more of celebrities and actors, and giving them a down-to-Earth platform.
Hot Ones can you put your biggest fans on hot ones. Would like to see a regular person do this.
What an incredibly nice guy
when he read that advert. at the end i lol'd hard
BRING BRITTANY BROSKI ONNNNN
best part is that Ed had so many possible "that what she saids" and no one did anything
"Don't bother".   LMAO!!!
egg*
So glad that Big Tuna and Andy are getting back together on the new show!
weeeee need a comp of people wow thats a good questions
Is it just me or... did the end of that come off as ignorant to anyone else!?! The way he couldn’t wait to leave. Could barely hang around and let Sean finish what he was trying to say and to then say, “Don’t bother!” when offered a BOX of sauces as a memento from this great interview you’ve just talked up!?! Maybe it’s just me but that just seems...off!😒And it spoiled what was, a really good  interview. Like, manners bud! Have any?!!
The music lol
Ed was fantastic. A real gentleman.
ah the Nard Dog !  awesome
*me after my first car crash*  “Oh man this is like hot sauce”
‘Don’t bother’  - Ed Helms 2022
Ed's story made me realize that LEWIS BLACK NEEDS TO BE ON HOT ONES.
Rainn and John!
He’s definitely sitting there and crying.
I do believe DA BOMB is the real vaccine for covid 19
I was hoping Ed would read a commercial for the new Hot Ones product in Walmart.
nice interview. Also i'll never sub to peacock.
Ed was a trooper.
Handled like a champ.
This guy and the amount of sincerity and relatability is astounding
I'm an old school Daily Show fan but I was impressed by the 2nd/3rd/4th bites he took of the hot ones, even if they hit him.
Mindy Kaling.  She'd probably would kill this challenge.
Out of curiosity, what was his next interview?  I want to see him sweating and squirming.
Man Amir got Mickey with this prank, all those wings. can't wait to see what That rascal Amir does next
I think I'm not understanding something here...this guys not an egg?
My god!!! its EGG HELMS for god sake EGG HELMS!!! Why do you people keep getting his name wrong?
Another great interview, Sean.
Is that the boner champ?
Reporter happens upon the scene of a fiery crash. Man struggles as he climbs from the burning vehicle. Reporter puts a mic in the man's face and asks, "...what role did roadside boiled peanut stands  play in your life". 😂
Just did my taxes and remembered about this video. Funny how they're sponsored by the same place I did my taxes through lol ads really do work
I agree with the pimento cheese sandwhich. When he asked what made one better?  My first thought was what Ed said.  They are all good.  No matter where they come from.  I have had them all.  It is like that you cannot destroy pimento cheese, no matter what you do it.
I love Ed and everything he does. And even more so now after learning he plays the banjo!! I have a thing for hot comedians playing the banjo ala the gorgeous Steve Martin. Guess I have two crushes now. 🤭
Like your new intro (or new to me maybe I've missed a few newer episodes) with the hot sauces cyphering thru the wrappers ending up with them lit like candles. Really nice!
I'm from sc so him talking about banjo got my interest, I personally, used to and still a little, play mandolin so I could kind of relate!
sean did you get new teeth???
This Ed man is a prince! Love him. Genuine, lovely, warm southern....love him.
Fuck TurboTax!
I have 2 amazing guys for an interview with you Sean!   1. Charlie Sheen 2. Jon Cryer   It would be absolutely amazing to see those two in an interview after all those years!  If you guys like the idea don't be afraid to give those thumbs ups! 👍
Um. You guy's got his name wrong. It's Egg Helms.
Love the episode. Kinda wish they brought up Aunty Donna, but I understand it's hard to pick and choose when you have such a prolific actor to interview. Great job, guys
It's not a bio hazard symbol it's an atomic bomb symbol thus da bomb. Dummy!
Can you bring on an older actor like Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Clint Eastwood (he’s 91), Jack Nicholson… who cares if they have nothing to promote. Actually, Scorsese has Killers of the Flower Moon coming out in the near future!   How about have Scorsese, De Niro, AND DiCaprio on all at once? 😃

Gemma chan please
Gotta love da bomb! Gets them everytime hahahaha
Who's this guy? Woe they'll take anybody on this show
Man he got old
Why doesn't anyone ever use vanilla ice cream? It's way better than milk.
It speaks volumes to Sean and his team when he's getting humble appreciations from the guest on the research they've dug into their guests background. Ed Helms is such a great actor, musician and a very funny guy! Amazing episode!
❤❤
Wait so based on the ad copy message did Sean also know Ed was called Asbestos Tongue by his brother!?   Man 👏🏼 does 👏🏼his 👏🏼 research!
If you can fuckin smack on a banjo its badass simple as that
he has not aged well
Are acid washed jeans coming back? Because I want nothing to do with that. Good interview though.

10/10 ride.
Anybody know the name of the song that starts at 21:03?
Would love to see John Krasinski on Hot Ones! Florence Pugh would be great, too
Really enjoyed watching your show today, thank you for the laffs
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
I'm still waiting to hear "You are Nardwar ..we have to know.."
Great to see him…. From the Daily to The office he would always stand out…
I always love your ability to think of questions you KNOW they will be ready to chat about and love it
"Don't Bother" -- the gloves finally come off
Idk why but "Oh...thats different" took me out 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭

I love ed!
I would love to see these episodes uncut.
You should have Jordan Peterson on
Can we PLEASE get the office ladies on hot ones
Respect on the double bites!  Not clearing wings but not cowering either.
The heat had his voice sounding more and more like Tim Allen as the interview went on.
Jeff Who Lives at Home is fantastic
The Bomb is one of the hottest sauces I've ever had. Not sure why it's not the last one.
Another excellent interview. The most priceless moment came right at the end. 🤣
Idk I could be wrong...but Ed seemed to have a bit of an arrogant air to him in this interview. Like I'm too good for this chicken wing shit lets get this over with. I HATE it when guests give that sort of vibe.
Seeing how impressed and his face lit up when he realized Sean asked deep, researched questions warms my heart
f.  and RESPECT.
can we have BTSs RM for their next album promotion?  this would give you millions of views believe me
this guy has a way with questions
I kinda hated Andy bc he was annoying but this made me like Ed Helms a lot more
Ed's mood literally got better and better with each wing, and by the end he was ecstatic! Love it!
"great questions" still so proud to hear that :) you doin a great job sean + team
John Krasinski (the TUNA!)
Te quiero andy
It's really hilarious/creepy when Sean eyeball fucks the guest as they're eating the wing
It's actually Egg Helms
Never expected Ed Helms but he seems like such a cool dude, another good episode
That last question was great but it was a missed opportunity to not make it about Hot Ones so it could be used in promotions/gags
Michael Scott!
FINALLY SOMEONE FROM THE OFFICE!!! 🙌🏼
Rididididu
Can you guys bring on Sullivan King next?? I think it would be a great interview
Loves this episode. I'm going to have to look up his band now. But as someone who loves in the south, pimento cheese sandwiches are the best. And I loved how he said don't bother with the remaining hot sauce. If he really didn't take them, could I get them? Or just 1 maybe?
I love it when Sean and his team get credit for their great research :-)
I love Ed Helms!  A class act all the way ...even with his mouth on fuego :)
Don't try this,kid,You are going to poop fire after this
Isn't complex going bankrupt? Get woke, go broke.
Don't say office.FUCK
I don't know.... I love hot sauce/Mexican food, Extra Spicy Thai food..... I think most of the "HOT SAUCE" these special guests are consuming are not what they want us to think. I know when I'm going up the scale of spicy, ...at some point I need some milk, and my breathing and all that reaction to the heat/burn prevents me from having a normal conversation, and the burn doesn't dissipate that quick like with these guys allowing them to continue conversating.  Could I be on to something here. Might just be looking for Ratings.
I’d love to see the interviews they have to do after hot ones
That looks like Andy Bernard
Now he looks more like Broccoli Rob than Andy Bernard
OUCH A~N
https://youtu.be/W9EQYKtEXSk
Ed seems like such an amazing guy
Love Ed and love hearing him say "Oooo good questions". 🤗 Sean's a beast.
I think he handled that pretty well. Ol' asbestos tongue may not be a bad moniker, and it even synergises with the voiceover ad.
Surely it makes sense to eat as much chicken as possible in each mouthful in order to dilute the sauce? Small bights have a higher sauce ratio.
riiit diiiit dooooodle dooooo
Ed helms seems like a genuinely good person. Super down to earth and humble!
Never expected Ed Helms but he seems like such a cool dude, another good episode
I think hot ones has become a rite of passage now.
Sean needs to donate his body to sience after this career. For real.
Random q, but what jeans are they wearing?
Does anybody want to see Jon Taffer on hot ones?
People really don't know what pimento cheese is? Unreal...
please bring in The Rock dwayne johnson
shout out oberlin!!!!
Good job Ed didn’t think you was gonna make it. But you finished strong!!!
20:54 what does tba mean
I love Ed Helms… he is so funny and seems so down to earth. I love actors who are grounded.  Awesome interview, it was hilarious and fun!
''don't bother''
Every time da bomb pops up, I’ve noticed I audibly say “oh no”, but in my head I’m screaming “here we go!”
Top 5 guest of all time!
Just want to say thanks for all the great content! Keep it up!!!!
Just want to say thanks for all the great content! Keep it up!!!!
Just want to say thanks for all the great content! Keep it up!!!!
Just want to say thanks for all the great content! Keep it up!!!!
Just want to say thanks for all the great content! Keep it up!!!
Can't believe Hot Ones wrote his name wrong... You guys, it's Egg Helms, as in egg.
Who?
What happened to this show? Sean used to focus on genuinely connecting and bouncing off what the guests have to say. Now he's just reading lines and ignoring things the guest says because it's not part of his lines being fed to him.
We need more Office cast members, most importantly CREED!!!! He’s had a long and interesting life, was even in a rock n roll band with a hit song in the 60s.
hey look EGG HELMS
Ed’s a great guest! A great actor and interesting to listen to. Also love the flaming graphics on the bottles 🔥 Happy New Year everyone…be well & enjoy life! Hot Ones 🤙🏼
Im sorry but I have to complain in the title and description you labeled him as ed helms while his actual name is Egg so please correct this and give the proper credit
They should have linked "asbestos mouth" nickname to the mesothelioma ad read it would have tied off the the first and last request nicely.
We've been asking for Keanu for ages.
Beer me that hot sauce
Just watched "Together, Together" on Hulu starring Ed. I didn't expect the tears at the end of such a chill comedy lol.  About to watch "Jeff Who Lives at Home" on Prime. Thanks for the tip, Sean!
This guy is a legend
I love what he says!
Hey ed helms love you so much such a honor to see you here.
Dont bother 🤣
60% of the time, it's Da Bomb every time.
Lol Da Bomb is always the great equalizer.  Every single time.    If anything proves that the Scoville Scale is bullshit, it's Da Bomb.  It should have a Scoville level of like 10 Million based on the reaction it gets every single time.
Does nobody wanna dip em in ranch? Like damnn that sucks
I AM A NON-ATTORNEY SPOKESPERSON!!!!!!!!!!!!
Still absolutely love Hot Ones! There is NO celebrity who can keep their "mask" on while shoving napalm into their mouth.
Who put my calculator in jello?
im sorry his name is egg helms
Sean wasn't as himself today
@Sean you should get Chris Tucker and Ice T on the show .
Get BJ Novak
My favorite character in The Office.
Alan Tudyk please!
The Nardog
Ed Helms seems like such a genuine person. He has that fatherly personality.
I must not fear, fear is the mindkiller.
One of the best episodes.
Damn!  Dem boogers are out of control!
The hangover, and tag are hilarious movies of his 🤣
Not alot of chemistry in that one. Ed seemed kinda caught off guard and off put. Cordial, yet forced by both.  Awkward ending/walk off.
Looks like Andy is doing pretty good
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life887
if anyone can find the interview ed does after this show i would love to watch it ahah
Most I've seen Sean react to da bomb for a long time
0:30 let me just correct you there, this is not an original comedy series it is a blatant rip off/spin off of the Australian version "True Story with Hamish and Andy" they're even wearing the same coloured blazers same lighting and seating positions
Why are you still virtue signaling the two tables
Yo, is that Egg Helms?
The editing is so damn good lmfao
Hangover 😵
Hot Ones and Mythical Kitchen are the best food related shows on YouTube IMO. Should do some kinda collaboration.
I would like to see jordan belfort cursing while eating those hot chicken wings.
ANDY BERNARD
Ed Helms is such a cool layed back dude
Hell yea Sean. He did it right. This was cool.  I loved The Office. My introduction to Helms.  Big fan of u both
Egg Helms managed the spice very well.
He could not get out of there faster. Impressed with the interview while speeding out. 🤣
Awesome, good show
As a guy from the Chicago Suburbs that Ad read was amazing
If you guys really did your research, you would have known that his real name is actually Egg Helms.
Low key good episode
I haven't enjoyed  and episode that much in a while, so funny and wholesome!
what a champ!
should have jacob bertrand and xolo Maridueña as a guest
I patiently wait every episode for each guest to try Da Bomb. (The Peak Sauce 😁). Sean always asks the question really quick before it really sets in 😂
Why so many cuts? I feel like he even spit out “da bomb”.
what were they gonna package up for him and  he said Dont Bother?
I am fucking obsessed with banjo's 😂 I would love if it someone could just follow me around and play banjo music to my life.....
Ed Helms is like the dad smoking weed with his son’s friends
I love how da bomb sauce is always the starting point to the insanity lol
The Rojo is my absolute favorite. Best smooth heat of the 3
It's "Egg" Helms, guys
I am totally impressed with him. He handles this like a boss!!
I think Da Bomb is the hottest sauce according to all of the guest reactions so far!
True story isn't an "original series" it's an adaption from Hamish and Andy. At least give credit where credit is due.
Best part is the very last words Ed says "Don't Bother" when offered the sauces lol.
John C Reilly would be an awesome guest I would think
Get pewdiepie as a guest!
Egg!
When are you ganna have Drake?
Rita doo doo do
My favorite part of this show is seeing people that I think are incredible come on and prove how genuinely cool they are and how much they just love what they do and love bringing people joy. Ed seems like a real one!
Gods The Office SUCKS!!!
Let’s have the trailer park boys
Yo
Why isnt Sean warning Ed about the eyes?
How about some rock or country stars in the mix?  Would love to see if Phil Labonta from All That Remains or Morgan Wallen on!
“Are you going to just sit here and cry?”
11:25 is this a good ass question or is it just bc im drunk?
Ed Helms is brilliant! I first saw him on The Office and I hated Andy!!!! Then, out from nowhere, I LOVED ANDY! He is just brilliant and funny! I can't believe he made it through the Apollo sauce! One drop of that about killed me! I didn't think it would ever stop burning! Great job, Ed!
Ed Helms is a genuinely nice guy! I’m a banjo player and met him many years ago at a bluegrass jam at a small bar in NYC. The jam ended kind of early. He came up to me and asked if I wanted to go back and forth on a bluegrass standard. Hell yeah! We ended going back and forth on “Old Joe Clark” with each one of our solos getting more and more bizarrely away from the melody of the song. It ended with both of us laughing because what we were eventually playing was so ridiculous!
“My nose is sprinting” Took a second but that is cleve to nose is runny
😂😂😂
No matter what. The bomb is the killer. Just because other have higher ratings, doesnt meant its the most painful one.  To the Bomb makers 👏👏👏 ill never ever try that shit on anything. Lol and I like this guy.
Neither Henry Cavill nor Keanu Reeves have been on this show
Go Egg Helms!!! I have no idea what executive producers like you actually do, but i STAN for lyfe.
"That's enough about the bluegrass Helms, enough about the God damn banjos. Lets eat some wings"
Oh, Was this Guy, One of the Guys in The Hangover!?
I can’t not see Andy 😂😂
Ed helms is a class act
It would’ve been better as Mr.Hyde and 13 scorpions lol
That was awesome!
Don't bother 😂😂😂😂
I'd love to be on this show just cause I love hot shit just sucks to not be a celeb and not be able to compete
Great actor and really enjoyed this interview.
Not satisfied with the banjo answer. Bring on the superior banjo playing comedian.
who's this guy and why does he look like that famous actor egg helms?
Sad to see there was no Lorax question :’(
This guy is awesome
I met Ed Helms a while back and he truly is such a nice and good person, huge fan
Great guy, always like to see people like this succeed.
STEVE CARRELLLLLLL NEXT PLEASEEEE
I need a link to whatever interview he went to after this one.
Wow that was kinda rude at the end…”We’re gonna package up those sauces for ya to take home”…….”Don’t bother” he says. He could have at least taken them as a token of their appreciation and could have given them away or thrown them away after he left. 😕 but I did really like how many kudos he gave on the research questions. Poor Sean looked so uncomfortable there when it was all over and Ed just walked away lol.
The don't bother is totally worth the entire watch
Im now watching Jeff who lives at home
Get Jason Sudekis on there as Ted Lasso, and see if he can stay in character as Ted the whole time
Get Jenna and Angela on together.
Jeff Who Lives at Home is an All Time great movie Ed!!! You and Jason killed it
Creed Bratton next!
Get Harry Mack on the show
LD Apollo is fantastic.
The very end haha!
Celebrities don't need to get facelifts, just go to Hot Ones
Ed Helms: Huh, that's his name.
Egg Helms
I never knew his name was Ed lmao I hate it. It's Andy
After watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tonight Show interview, I really want to know what Ed Helms next interview was.
Mark 8:36- “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” Anyone that does not make sure they have taken care of their soul will end up destroyed. Your soul is the part of you that is eternal. It is tragic when a person dies and is not sure of where they will spend eternity.
3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”  4 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.  9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
Yo turbotax still owes me like 120$ for that class action lawsuit that was filed. Anyday now yall can pay me you fuckers.
Rit Dit Dit Di Doo!
Please have Nardwuar on the show
Sounds a lot like true story with Hamish and Andy
so weird I was just watching office clips and this pops up 🤔
These interviews should be part of every journalism class... the questions are brilliant... the whole research they put into it is just impressive.
Let's get cheeto andrew santi o
Ed Helms is going back to his spicy roots and try to reignite that flamin self.
Cornell greatest alumni
Great episode!
Genuinely funny dude. Man I wish The Office was still going....
Wow. You decided to interview someone that may not be a demon from hell this season? I thought your next interview would be Chelsea handler and Casey Anthony, but Ed healms is a refreshing change of pace. Maybe next week you'll get back to human garbage.
I love the editing. When the heat kicks in and the sound just transcends, emphasizing the burning.
That's his name I remember him  playing in those moves hangover franchise
Is that Andy?
I just now finished The Office. This is quite some timing.
He looks baked as fuck.
why do I get a sick grin every time a guest bites into da bomb?! 😂😂
Don’t bother 😂💀
I love Egg Helms!
I've got IBS. No way in hell I would survive this show without having to go crap 10 min after the first few wings.
"We're going to package up those for you"  "Don't bother"  😂
I love hot sauce
Where's that shirt from Sean?
I would LOVE to see the interviews these celebrities do after doing Hot Ones. Like Id pay money to see them suffer lol
You keep saying Ed but his name is actually Egg. Get cultured.
Ed Helms is a total goat this is awesome
Q- What's the definition of a "Perfect Pitch" in baseball?  A- When you throw a banjo in the dumpster and it lands on an accordion!  one of my fave jokes of all time!
Andy Bernard... i am now a fan of yours. Congratulations. You earned it.
Sean ur the one thats crazy bro u do this all the time how can u handle it and be so kool calm and collected love the show keep it up
Sean still bringing his A game
He did the office and hangover at the same time.  Damn!
he'll always be the 'nard dog
Sean much love from Cape Town
19:05 “That’s what she said”
Matthew 25:45-46 King James Version 45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
Wow!! Ed is such a real deal likeable guy!! I'm not even mad at him anymore for Andy's shenanigans on Office!! Thanks for another great one Sean, this one is up there in the top five for me!!
"Stew! Your a freaken Doctor!!"
Stu !!!!
5:58 the first time I've ever heard Sean ask a question I already heard before :o
"Don't bother" 😂🤣
It’s great to hear that Jim and Andy get their own show together.
Never expected Ed Helms but he seems like such a cool dude, another good episode
Hey! How do we nominate a guest, I have a notable South African/American I mind that I’d love to see how far they get through the hot sauce. Also…they are my boss, so…
What a warrior!
Harry styles on this would be awesome
Great interview!!!
Ed crushed it.
"don't bother" :DDDD
is tha bomb and last dab the only sauces that have made it the entire series
Roman Reigns for Hot Ones!
"Don't bother." Hahaha!
I didn't expect him to talk with the same cadence as Andy Bernard lmao
AH RUDDA-DAT DAT DO!!!
Don't bother🤣
Great Job Fellas.  Ed, you did an awesome job handling all of that heat.👍👍
Oh shit its the guy from USPIS
"Don't bother." 🤣🤣🤣🤣

You need to get Ryan Reynolds and Joe Rogan and Dr. Disrespect

Egg Helms Needs a Mouth Medic While Eating Spicy Wings | Hot Ones
"Perfect Pitch" is when you throw an accordion into a dumpster and it lands on a banjo....

Cheers to Ed, for staying on track - simply because Sean Evans was.   Keeping us on the continued journey.
okay but who doesn't love ed helms
Now you gotta get Randell Park on!
I once chewed Ed's dingle berries straight from his backside.
Has Ryan Reynolds done Hot Ones? Sean please get him!! love your show!
Would just love to point out Hamish and Andy did this “true story” idea already
ROO DOO DOO DOO DOO!
Man these sauces seem low key, no?
You misspelled his name. His name is Eg not Ed.
Wait.  Pete holmes has a podcast?  Can you guys get pete holmes on this show?
He can so just sit here and cry.
Okay random and nobody cares BUT Ed Helms interviewed my dads for The daily Show back in the day and I have a picture of Mr Helms and myself when I was probably 4 years old. At the time I had no idea who he was and I was not impressed by him whatsoever (which the picture shows very clearly 🤣) but now I'm so grateful that I have that picture cuz it's a cool anecdote to tell.
I would love to see the slow mo guys on hot ones
fantastic interview.....such a funny guy.  Plus.....you can actually see snot dripping from his nose at the end!  My fave ending of all time!
I'd like to see Bob Odenkirk on the show!
*Egg Helms
boiled peanuts do NOT do it for me...lol
Bro ed is an old man now!!! Wow time flys!!
Genuinely funny dude. Man I wish The Office was still going....
Please get Jason Sudeikis on the show
I teach the truth about the Holy Bible on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/mttracks. Support your fellow Hebrew Israelite on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/mttracks?fan_landing=true -MTTRACKS
You guys should get Jeffery Donovan on the show this season
I love Ed Helms so much. He’s such a brilliant comedian and this interview was amazing as always
Please please please invite Bryan Cranston!
God I love his work on the office such a classic
Love Ed but True Story is actually a remake of the show here in Australia. It’s not original.
Good-💩
the guitar that slowly going out of tune when eating wing 2 is top tier
I jus finished watching the hangovers
dope on the hot sauces!!!! claps! I am happy to see this! ♥♥ good interview!
https://youtu.be/1L3bt-eKnz4 👀🥵
Finally a good guest 💀🔥🤷
Ed will always be "The Hangover Dude" to me
The Complete Wario Apparition-https://youtu.be/w6_uX74wjVo
Ed is a legend. This might be te best episode ever.
Sean is starting to phone these in ngl…
Jesus he is bland.
“Don’t bother” lmao
Should have The Rock on here sometime, so we can see if he can muscle his way trough the pain.
Sean didn't say "...my friend" at the end. gotta re do this one
Ed helms is a cool dude and he's pretty chill when you meet him.
What's up with the flames on the bottles...weird.
Rit dit dit doo dooooo
The backround looks beautifully black on my monitor and smartphone. What camera are you using ??? Is it expensive hardware or just a setting ??
Staff: "And we're gonna package up those hot sauces for you" Ed: "Don't bother"  My heart sank :(
I’m a mouth medic😈
Actually it's Egg Helms
YES!
You guys should have made him do an ad for First we feed insteed
Bring mat pat to the hot ones
He also did the vacation movie which I watch whenever it’s on tv
https://youtu.be/ymYB0zLIotU
Love your videos!! Everyone be safe out there ❤️
Egg Helms is hilarious
Get joe Rogan on !
Salsa or hot sauce isn’t hot sauce or salsa unless it has tomatoes in it..
Am I the only person that affiliates this man with the hangover over the office?
What a great guy
Ed Helms is the man
16:44 Are there other interviews where Sean is so affected by the wings?
19:47 THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! 😂
Something about the black backdrop just makes the interview intimate
PAGING DR F@$$0T!!!!!
Ed looks like he’s never gotten a good nights rest. Someone tuck him in with some Benadryl 😂😂
You know if Dwight knew Andy did this he would have to go on the show and try to do better.
Speaking as a banjo geek, it is now CRIMINAL for every episode that does not involve STEVE MARTIN.
Who has links to the post interviews when guest leave hot ones.
How many guests have responded to Da Bomb with "there is nothing redeeming about that"?
The "don't bother" at the end really got me. Great one!
This dude reminds me of my Dad lol super cool guy ! Great episode !
It sucks boiled peanuts aren’t a thing out here in Cali, it was such a big part of my childhood growing up in Florida  Also plz invite the spice king in here 😂
I love at the very end when the lady says "we'll pack up those hot sauces for you" and Ed is just like "don't bother" LOL!
I was hoping to hear a new song, but Allan wasn't here to inspire him
I love Ed Helms!
Craving Hot ones! SCategory of boss jams  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxx_ed3GR-kjYS7TknKbIFZNMRHV9wuY6 jumping up for style https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxx_ed3GR-kgD2y6TffUFeK2XUbrl8soO
awesome episode. seriously gonna watch his stuff now. i totally forgot he was on tds
omg, this is the "What Do Tigers Dream Of?" guy
What a fucking gangster this dude is
The "Don't bother" at the end 🤣
Both Steve Carrell and Rainn Wilson would be fantastic guests!
Just an opinion here but dont ruin the moments by showing some of them at the beginning. Like showing a trailer and showing all the good parts
I figured out recently that it's not the heat that gets to me in hot sauces. I can eat fresh peppers all day long and not blink an eye  It's the insane amount of vinegar in a lot of them..
ru gu gu gu .... the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue n the man n the moon, when u coming home dad i dont know when, we'll be together thennn ... ohhh yhhh were gonna have a good time thennnnnn
the mesothelioma ad at the end had me dying 😂 they even got the background music for it too 😂
Ed Helms seems like a really nice person. Thank you Hot Ones team for all your efforts over the years!
You guys….it’s Egg Helms.
Ed’s description of acapella music is so spot on
It pains me so much to watch Andy Bernard degrade into such an unredeemable and insufferable character in season 9 of the office when I know how damn awesome Ed Helms is irl :(
Ed took those wings like a champ lol
I love Ed Helms so much. He’s legit one of my biggest celebrity crushes, and I don’t really think I need a specific reason. ♥️
Glad Sean threw in an Oberlin shoutout as an alum.
Andy and Jim making a show together!!! Yes!!!
Whoever scheduled this in the middle of the press junket instead of at the end should be fired immediately for not doing any research.
they NEED john cena on hot ones
Nard Dog!
Get Louis CK here PLEASE
Don't Bother hahahahaha
-0:50 🤣🔥🔥🔥
Andy Bernard!!!!!!! On my goodness that was so awesome. 😊😊😊😂😂
Y'all should really divide the episode chapters by hot sauce so I can go back to da bomb every video to rewatch where it all starts going down in flames lol. It would be nice, but thanks for the content nonetheless team!
THE BOTTLES ON FIREEEEEEEEEE
As usual, Sean rules...and Ed Helms is just funny to watch all the time...
He’s a polite southern boy, put on a good face, I don’t think he saw ONE episode before doing his lol. I do love when guests are pleasantly surprised by the questions and research. Still a great episode!  Thank you Ed and Sean!
I see the Nard Dog i click
Good episode. Now lets get MattPat
8:02 🤍 sums it all up, LOVE this guy 🤍
You should get the Office Ladies (Jenna Fischer & Angela Kinsey) to come on. They've even got a new book coming out soon. They could promote it on your show!
Lets get MatPat Gametheory up there!
Its Egg holms not ed
Idk why the scoring during his ad read and his plug had me laughing so much lmao
Damn I want that box, you guys ship to the eu?
Please please don’t ever get rid of the new background music!!!!!!!!!💯💯💯🤙🏽🔥
It was interesting to hear Ed Helms' voice slowly turn into Tim Allen's.
https://youtu.be/yC6C_xi7gvY
I don’t care what anyone says, Sean Evans is the best interviewer out there :)
on the banjo argument i will only say one thing. outer wilds.
That ending, don't bother was great 👍🏽
Bring Zezima next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rId6PKlDXeU   for those who forgotten  about this masterpiece
Theee Narddddd Doggggg
I haven't seen Sean laughing so much for a long time!
We need to get Sasha Baron Cohen on this show!
I would love to see you guys get a NHL superstar like Sidney Crosby or Connor McDavid on the show. McDavid is always so bland when he talks that the hot sauce should put some life into him
😢
Those wings got nothing on the Nard Dog💪💪💪
only sean evans would make ed helms read the mesothelioma meme ad 😭
The background music in the beginning reminds me so much of the closing time tune, hard to unhear it even if it's not
So you're telling "I'm going to die"🤣🤣🤣😂
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
Take me home To a place  I belong! 😅
I've watched a lot of this show and I have to say Ed Helms deserves a hot ones championship belt! He just destroyed the last dab Apollo wing and didn't budge! I want this sauce just to pinky dip it lol but that was amazing 👏
Was surprised he didn't punch through that wall.
I love the hot sauces on display, makes me want to buy a bottle of it; which is the bottle that was shown last?   Also, I've found a really good hot sauce, it's labeled "only one drop needed" and it couldn't be more true, that shit is hot. 2m scoville units, would love to see you do it with a more spice-experienced guest, or something of that magnitude.
Number 7 (12 scorpions Jekyll & Hyde) was coated ! 🤣
We need to find this other interview Ed did after Hot Ones.
the fact that i found out he plays the banjo just was the coolest thing ive ever heard xD
he was in and out. dang lol
🤙😜😂
have tobey maguire on next
Whoa ed helms looks like ben affleck and low key ben stiller
Da Bomb did da bomb
Don’t bother? Sad face…lol
Do yourself a favor. Please pause this hot ones and go watch the Yasmin episode. I cried the happiest of tears watching this one. I just got choked up writing this comment and remembering the episode. And when you’re done with that check out Gastor for a big laugh. Then come back here for more Ed.
I've been saying this my entire adult life: The world needs more banjo.
I found Da Bomb, then ordered a 3 pack from The Heatonist. With a few others, some friends and family are going to do a "Hot Ones Roulette" with what we have. Tobasco, Franks, Sriracha, The Classic, Las Calientes, Da Bomb and The Last Dab. Going to be a hot party!
Miss ya Ed, you’re a great actor
I got to get this out to the producers here. While the flaming cap is neat, it's also very distracting away from the bottle label and I find myself forgetting what sauce is up. All I can do is stare at the flame. Please, reconsider.
Has the rock.did this yet cause I feel like he needs to lol
Bring Matpat on. He will defeat you. Lol
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
Sean should watch crtikal’s review of the sauces
Ed helms is just full of life. Comedy,acting,acapella,banjo etc this guy can do almost everything.
NARDDAWWWGGGGGGG
And now I’m obsessed with Ed Helms. Such a lovely man!
Critical Role episode.
Don't bother 🤣
Ed is legit in the throws of death and Sean is just grinning and nodding in reply lol
now you have to get Michael Scott himself on to the show..Mr.Steve Carell! :o
that last dab was heroic if not naiive, compared to other guests who just touch the bottle against the wing
*Not very much of a lineup this year for hot ones. Last year wasn’t that great either compared to the other years. Hope you will be getting some relevant celebrities soon. Jason Momoa, Dwayne Johnson, Josh Brolin, Vin Diesel, The list goes on. Who would you like to see on hot ones that has an already been on?*
Sad to see a turbotax advertisement. A company that conspires with lawmakers against the american people. cmon guys
Angolmois: Genkou Kassenki - Opening "Braver by Straightener"[Color Coded Lyrics Romaji] : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1a18WuM6B8&ab_channel=Kurowolf
This is how I’d imagine all white people talk to each other
Hey, try to get Alan Ritchson who is the new Jack Reacher on Amazon Prime.
Nice to see him on the show, that Cornell degree took him far!
Dude, one of my favorites
Love Ed Helms from Indonesia 🇮🇩
Can we sign a petition to get nardwuar on the show, interview of the century
this might be the biggest facial transition in hot ones history.  You can see his face melting in real time.
We need an episode with nardwuar
.... i have done acapella music since i was 6..... I may be smug.... but i have never thought that the music was the thing that did that. Now I know.
Staff - "And we're going to package up these boxes for you to take home." Ed - "Don't bother" LOL 😂🤣😂
So much better than that Seth Rogen episode, this gives me hope for the future of this season🤞
Putting Hot Sauce on an Egg is always a good idea!
https://youtu.be/Fo4SnFc0FuA
Why is everyone getting so old
Ed Helms looks like he worked in the Trump administration now that he's old and wrinkly
"Don't bother." 😂😂😂😂😂
I'd like to see Penn & Teller do Los Calientes .
RRR-D-D-D-DOOO
Thank God he didn't punch a hole in the table !
https://youtu.be/ZD0lpb8ECpk
Rududududu
I just go straight to them eating Da Bomb in every episode lol
Sean must be loosing his tolerance after so many interviews.
great reaction to the last dab. "Yeah? Are we shakin it up??"
I like guests that actually eat the wings and not nibble
New favorite guest. Love how he trusts Shaun and just leans in to the interview.
Brutal to see how low you go though for Hollywood fame when it comes to movies like Vacation and Father Figures.  What possess someone, well we know what does, money and fame but to do paedophile related scenes and you know what else in these movies is seriously seriously hard to watch if you're awake to it all.  Hollywood slowly desensitising people to seriously dark dark sh*t.  Price of wanting to make it in Hollywood.  Feel like you've done more movies on this stuff than most for a while now.  I know you know.
hey its Egg Helms
Random but id buy a shirt that says "Ten Wings Up, Ten Wings Down" with a picture of a fully eaten tray of wings.
Really great episode!!!
this was a murder
What's up with them red, glassy eyes Ed Helms????
Great interview with Egg Helms
omg SO HAPPY he's here!!!!!! I did not mind some of the recent guests that much, but clicked instantly for him 🤩
4:23 those 3 separate c alliteration thoooooooooo 14:32 Sean with his version😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
maybe the first time da bomb got to sean too  wow
This is not the energetic crazy Andy I have seen
He looks so tired
The presenter has about as much personality as a lump of coal
“My nose is sprinting”
My brother called me asbestos tongue.....no he didn't
15:53 Da' Bomb, you're welcome.
Worse interview of the year!
I don't know who Ed Helms is but Egg Helms is really funny in this
Egg Helms
It is yummy phuckin andy
Shut up about the sun!!
How to see unsee Andy in him? I can't do it.  #ilovetheoffice
His story about his tooth is crazy. I'm missing the same incisor because I just never had the adult tooth and I also had to wear a retainer with a fake tooth built in. Small world lol
Its was a bad date ending just a awkward exit with no hug, or even a handshake. Keep my distance and exit the set. "We can box those up for you.."  DON'T BOTHER." Lol
Would love to see a montage of interviews that had to take place after this one.
He is such a nice guy 🥰
The man is openly WEEPING - he’s visibly scared of what is happening to his body and begging for a medic I’m absolutely losing it ahaha
I LOVE EGG HELMS
Y’all should get Chris Pratt on the show!
https://youtube.com/channel/UCtdA4Vw6v-SQC25rXCb7Lpg
So nobody's going to talk about how Jason Sudeikis and Ed Helms look like the same person.
Sean is just such an incredible host, really. His charisma is just off the charts by just being himself and you can see this when guests compliments him for doing his research. He rarely ever responds to it, much less with a sinple 'thank you' because for him it is necessary to research your guests, not an obligation but a must. Keep up the good work, Sean and the Hot Ones! 🤘
This was a weirdly comforting episode and I enjoyed it very much
NARD DOG!
shoutout to the guy for realizing that the banjo and acapella music aren’t cool by normal standards but loves them just the same
Somehow Ed Helms saying "yummy" makes total sense
He didn't draft during the running portion of the triathlon that's why he lost
Wondering if Sean has pre-Bomb anxiety…while the guests usually try it for the first time he knows exactly what is coming yet he still goes for it every time. Respect.
it's "EGG Helms"
GET JASON BATEMAN ON THE SHOW
Will you please offer the uncut content to these interviews?  Start a patrion or something.  I would love to see these full interviews.
eMoTioNaL dAmAge 18:59
thanks ed for pointing out how much good and deep sean's questions are
You guys misspelled his name. His name is Egg Helms.
True story an original?? What about Hamish and Andy's True Story tv show..
I've said this before, but I love how Sean skips the last dab when the guest is really struggling
Really like Ed. This show is so great.
What a genuinely lovely guy Ed is. So talented, intelligent and humble. Brilliant guest and fab questions!
"I wish there was a way to know you were in the good old days before you actually left them."  -Andy Bernard (Ed Helms)
where are the sauces available again?
The music ruins it
I miss old Daily Show. So many teens grew up on watching that to gain knowledge and understanding of the world through a comedic venue
The goat
Truth or Dab with John Krasinsky and Rainn Wilson
this show makes me want wings so bad
Haven't seen Sean struggle like this with Da Bomb in a while, I've eaten that shit once and it's still in my fridge, I'm never gonna touch that metallic tasting pain inducing bs ever again :D Glad to see Sean still get's screwed by it, not going to lie :D
"Don't bother"  LMAO
love this guy hehhee
This hot sauce just might make him sit here and cry
Every time a guest says “that’s a great question.” I smile.
“We’re gonna package up those sauces for you.” Ed - “Don’t bother.”  LMAO
His mouth/face tomorrow: 🏜
Steve Martin STILL plays the banjo! Banjo is BOSS!! THAT IS YOUR EXCUSE! LMAO!!!  Kidding but ultimately not kidding! Steve Martin is a comedic genius and a profound banjo player. Like Weird Al. Weird Al made the accordion COOL! Keep on playing Ed Helms! You are BOSS!! ❤❤❤
For anyone interested true stories was originally a TV invented by the Australian comedian/presenters Hamish & Andy
wait he was actually in an acapella group in college IRL thats hilarious
Why is every one of ed helms characters a complete tool
When are you guys gonna get Chael Sunnen on the show. That be awesome.  🍻🙋
Love Ed Helms, love Randall Park. Definitely gonna check out that show
I wonder have they tried to get Beyoncé or Jay-z on here lol. That’d be cool.
I love this show not only because of the celebrities suffering and challenging themselves but also because of Sean and his great research and questions. You always get so much new insights of the guests on a personal level and in a total honest way. Nothing feels staged or scripted. No other "talkshow" can compete here.
Keanu Reeves on this would be amazing.
How many hot ones where the laptop didn’t come out
So taken from Australia tv Hamish and Andy did the same show a few years back
Dawson's Hot Sauce is really good!
He seems like a very cool dude for real!! 😁
I have seen most of Hot Ones, it seems like Sean and Ed didn’t mesh well. It just seemed dull and they didn’t really like each other.
Ed Helms is the better Jason Bateman
would have loved more office questions
"We're gonna package those sauces for you."  Ed- "Don't bother." great ending!
We are going to pack them up for you, "BOTH BOTHER!!!" LMAO
Actually it's egg helms
Can you get The Report of the Week on here? Please!
Da bomb is just extracts and awful flavors. Wish you'd get rid of it and get some real hot sauces.
Wow Jason Sudeikis really aged and looks like an old gramp
I love how Sean is leaning back and has a grin on his face as they do the bomb knowing full well what's about to happen 😂
Really went full-circle on the whole "asbestos" thing.  From "My brother called me 'asbestos tongue'" to "Mesothelioma is a rare cancer linked to asbestos exposure".
Ed is such a fucking good dude.
You’re awesome ED Helms
Would love to see an other hangover movie
Really respectful, insightful guest
andy finally got his shot at  fame .
Kool. I really like him even more. Great (hot) stuff.
What’s Evan talking about? That’s Andy.
Hate they never mentioned Hamish and Andy
I  love Ed Helms, he is hilarious. He is a great actor. Maybe not the best but he is a memorable person
Girl: We're gonna package up those sauces for you to take home Helms: Don't bother...  LMAO That last part had me DYING
I'll take the questions, but fuck your sauce, keep that shit away from me.
"My brother called me Asbestos tongue" Why did that sound like such an Andy thing 😂
Ed helms looks old af
Don't bother😂😂😂 god this show is great
https://youtu.be/1DR_YRXpI1c
One thing about the Banjo. If you hit someone with it, they’re going down.
So tom segura sold yall out, he said on his podcast that yall trick the guest, "da bomb" at number 8 is actually the hottest
I wish there was a way to know you’re in the good old days before you’ve actually left them.
I've watched a few of these now and I don't get Da Bomb. It just doesn't fit. Literally no redeeming feature. Everyone says it just tastes like crap. Fantastic interviews. Love the show.
Sean, we need to know, did Ed take the sauces in the end? :D
The banjo is excellent and so is the accordion, play them well, just like any other instrument!
Don’t bother… love that!😂 think that was enough pain for a good while
Nard dog strikes again
Ed Helms seems like a real cool and funny guy to hang out with
bring back some pepper north
Me a person who's never had any of these sauces still salivate for those wings.
COVID 19 VACCINES ARE NOT VACCINES!
Bothers me that he has starded fakeing it to make the guests feel good. Used to be so good when he just sat there smiling while thay were dieing in pain.
We need to start a collaboration. I will start a show called "The morning after", one camera, one toilet and people just finding new faith through pain.
They called me asbestos tongue, I could really handle my spice food. Use to nail every dish, used to call me Ace.
we love a guest that appreciates the background research and thoughtfulness of the questions
Always great to see Egg Helms!
I can't believe people are still getting his name wrong, his name is Egg Helms smh.  Also, please get the Aunty Donna boys on one day 🥺
We NEED Zach Galifinakis on this show ASAP. Hangover 1 is an all time comedy.
Go watch Jeff who lives at Home if you haven't seen it yet!
Ed Helms, even more of an awesome dude that I’d hoped.
Love his acting. First time I’ve seen him and known about him was hangover lol. Then the one on peacock with the native reservation show lol Gunther falls or something lol.
Ed: "The front of my face is throbbing, this is doing permanent damage." Sean: Nods excitedly
Only seen this guy in the hangover, everything else he was on was pretty much only shown in America,so, plus he does podcasts, yeah the "celebrity sex tapes" of the 2000's, but guy seems pretty ok. It's another clip I can watch, walk away to get a beer, come back & I know I didn't really miss anything....
WOW Hamish and Andy were able to sell True Stories to NBC. Must be nice,
Great episode. Ed seems like a good dude.
Loved this episode. One of my favourites now!
Omg Egg!
He's gonna Blister up jkn
I didn't recognize him without his glasses on lol.
What a nice person! Thanks Ed and Sean for the great piece of entertainment!
“Oh I can just sit here and cry” -Nard Dog
Great episode
I just re-watched the movie "Together Together" with him in it.  Great movie!
Um Original comedy series true story?  Just ignoring the show the bought the rights from in australia?  Hamish and andy true story?  Fuck sake
Love Sean’s outfit in this video, fire blazer! 🔥
I love this guy
Would you guys ever do subscriber edition? 😂 get just your average subscriber on to do this? Would love that haha
Rainn or Steve please
Mindy K
You can always tell who watches the show and who doesn’t 😂
"Don't bother" lol
Nard Dogg!!
Damn he’s old
Ed’s grates role was in Auntie Dona’s big ol house of fun on Netflix
I clicked on this so fast. Love him ❤️
Why is Ed Helms famous?  Can anyone explain it?  He seems like a nice guy and all...  Great name....for a news anchor....
That “don’t bother” at the very end was the deepest cut I’ve heard on this show since Idris Ilba wanted to fight the shows creator...😆
i started hating Andy Bernard once he left on that trip for a long time and came back really rude and an asshole
Hey guys. You've managed to get Kevin Hart and a lot of wrestling celebrities to come, but can you convince the Rock to join the spicy wing party? Big fan of the show :) keep up the great job. Cheers from Romania !
Please get Mike Tyson. That would be such a profound interview.
After quitting Dunder Mifflin Andy seems really laid back now. Reh deh deh deee dooooo
such a great episode!!!!!!
Making fun of asbestos poisoning at the end, that’s great 😁 Definitely will not be watching you and the Korean dude on your new show. Such Hollywood.
omg is that baby wawa???
Taking real bites.  Helm for pres
This was great.
The Office is the best show ever
I really feel like this is good accompaniment to weed...       Any desire for a slightly longer form version that includes weed? I feel like you've got the cultural courage
Great phrase ‘after burner’ and ‘something talking back to me’.  First time I recall hearing those words on your show.
You could tell at the end there Ed was trying to make a break for the bathroom lol, poor guy. Glad he had fun though.
Am I the only one that thought he was Jason Sudeikis?
Did not think he would finish and finish with a bang too. Very Impressed. Very enjoyable Ed Helm Puts out a Show like always.
Looks like Sean got those Hollywood teeth
Put this man in the hot ones Hall of Fame! It looks like he was feeling the heat more than anyone on the show (excluding DJ Khaled) but he exhibited the willpower to push through and made it till the end.
Each episode is as perfect, memorable, and beautiful as a Disney movie.
Stew
Sunny d helps with the burn!
“My brother called me asbestos tongue” gave me “They called me Ace, got straight A’s”  “They called me Buzz, got straight B’s” Vibes
Tim the tat man or nicmercs next
They keep misspelling his name, it isn't Ed, it's Egg Helms.
HIS NAME IS EGG!
All of them!
Ed is such a cool dude :) Keep up your work  🌶 man. 👏
Wait. But is he actually Philip DeFranco's father?
Hey it's the Nard Dog!!!!
Australian tv show first, not original..?
What a great dude. 👍
love it!!!! ed champ!!
John Krasinski
Ed took em like a champ! Awesome!
pls have bad bunny ❤️
riditditdidooo
It’s dope to see Andy and Jim working on a new show together
Luckily things didn't get too heated that he smashed the wall or the table
you guys spelt egg wrong
Any one else catch that ed said he had a nick name asbestos tongue and did an ad read for mesothelioma which is a disease causes by asbestos exposure?
Every time a guest praises or comments on your questions and research I smile. Learning those little known things makes it more personal and enjoyable. I feel for the guy... He seemed wounded at the end but still seemed so grateful for the depth in the interview....
First We Feast... Thank you! Ed Helms has been in all of my favorite movies and TV shows growing up. You asked all of the right questions to all of the answers I wanted to know about. Keep up the good work and again, Thank you.
Its egg helms why do the keep getting his name wrong
Selma Hayek was a huge guest but this is also high #quality
Lol defs saw Sean getting excited and amused ahead of Da Bomb 😂😋
I can't be the only one who expected Ed to say "Thank you muchly, for having me on the show."
my favorite movie if him is fast & furious21 did you guys see the stunt he make to scape the truck
That’s why his missing tooth looked so real. 🤣🤣🤣☠️
Okay but these sauce names are intimidating afff💀😂😂
Stupid 6 feet rule is in effect I see 😂 great job for your efforts guys lmao
Any chance you get Kyle MacLachlan on here?
I would love to see the real folk’s out there trying ur wing’s sauce maybe once a month pick and choose someone that would be great 👍
great guest
I love that Andy made it in show biz! Everyone doubted him, but look at him now! 🖕🏼
23:48 wait Ryan Dunn’s an executive creative director??
The fact that he used to do commercial reads makes his (excellent) guest feature in the Punch Brothers song even funnier.
As a straight male, I was not expecting to fall in love with Ed Helm. I've never been so sure someone has a 12 inch dong.   Sold me on his show about stories, always loved "this is not happening" and those stories, Humility about the banjo is relatable. Triathlon.   Def huge hanging weener.
Us From NC love their boiled peanuts
https://youtu.be/yC6C_xi7gvY
I remember seeing Ed Helms at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, he wasn't playing, he was attending. That man does indeed love the banjo.
True story is and “original” American adaption of an Aussie tv show..
i want to see the interview Helms went to after this
Omg I didn't know there was gonna be an American version of True Story?! I've just seen the Australian one with Hamish and Andy. Good to see some aussie content spreading to other countries :D
Ohhh so andy and jim are back at it again🔥🔥👍🏼
Sean Evans = GOAT interviewer
Amazing episode!! Loved every second!
Man was Ed just extra tired? Or is my image of him stuck in the time of The Office and he’s aged naturally since then?
This guy looks like hell. Go get another boosta
Love the grey hairs Ed has ❤️
Looking forward to seeing a US spin on what was a great Aussie show.
Such a fantastic interview, Ed you are an absolute legend 💚
Da Bomb totally burned out his nerve endings near the end 😂
At 24:03 you realize Ed Helms wishes he and his publicist were dead. He regrets this.
Sean's jacket though🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😻
My man looks A HUNDRED in the thumbnail hahahaahahhaha
It’s really fucking frustrating to hear Sean mispronounce Egg’s name all the time. Like show some respect to Egg, like you do all the other guests, Sean.
Seems kinda "forced" this week 🤷🏻‍♂️
10
K this was one of my favourite hot ones 😂😂
all of them!!!
Not going to lie by the time he got on the office it wasn’t as nearly as funny and also not cuz of him… just weird for it to be listed as A huge accomplishment when in reality it was probably just the vehicle to get his name out there… mind you he wasn’t bad in the office, and the dip in quality wasn’t his fault, just felt the writers ran out of gas!!!
"so your telling me I'm going to die" 😂😆
Mouth Medic at 14:45
Poor guy, it looked like no silver lining kind of experience for him🌶🤷‍♂️😅
This dude easily gets comments from people who think he's Nat Faxon.   They fill the same role in Hollywood.
I would love to see people that had to do interviews after doing this show 🤣🤣
Damn. I like Ed far better than any of his characters.
This show is so much better at showing us the human behind the 'actor' than literally any talk show has ever done. There's no fluff, the entertainment isn't staged, it's real and Sean clearly does a lot of work researching his questions. Even if it isn't just Sean doing this research the show itself feels so genuine. It's a lot of fun to watch.
Yeah Egg Helm. Lovely guys.
do matpat
Eats Da Bomb - "Are you seriously still trying to do this interview right now?!"
I think I like the SNL beyoncé thing better than the actual show
Wow i gotta say him reading the ad script with hot sauce in his mouth was much more impressive to me then i thought it would be. So professional so 👌
Why put the tables so far apart. Please tell me you aren't one of those woke fools.
Anyone know the music that plays when he eats the Beyond Insanity one?
I'm in my 50's, and Steve Martin was the first banjo player I was introduced into when I was a teen. Banjo is folk music comfort food.
Really want to see Steve carrel, Andy samberg, Adam Sandler, or impractical jokers on here
We need the Channel 5 news crew now!!
Yeah nah, True Stories is a show in Australia with Hamish & Andy and has been on for about 3-4 years. Even the sets are similar. It’s not ‘original’.
Well…I don’t think you are in touch anymore with the underclass women
He said don't bother lol
Ed is a good guy
Luv this show, and Ed fights to hold on to his sanity.  He did well (as sweat rolled down his face). True Story on Peacocks will be a great show, looking forward to it.
Not a single cuss word in the episode, Ed's running nose said it all
Asbestos tongue was Andy’s real nickname in his a cappella group at Cornell 😂
why are they sitting at two tables?
Flames are a very nice touch
Seans a great interveiwer. I love ed and i love the banjo! 🥰🥰🥰
"I feel like this is actually 20 or 30 scorpions" 😂caught me off guard so funny
Whose next?! NARDWUAR!!!!
WoOoOoOoW I feel like I've heard his voice in so many commercials and never knew it lol good episode 👏
Love this show, love hot sauce, but there's no way on this Earth I'm paying $10 or more for a small bottle of it.  Call me crazy, but I buy a gallon of Frank's at Sam's Club for around $13.  I bought a squeeze bottle like you'd put ketchup in at a diner and I just fill it up from the gallon and that gallon lasts me about 6 months (I put that stuff on most everything).  I just feel the whole hot sauce market is insane with their pricing.  I mean, think about it.  It's some spices and vinegar and water, made in huge batches and put in a bottle.  $3 or $4 tops is what I'd pay for that.  But because there's a hot sauce cult out there, these manufacturers feel they can come up with some clever name, put some bold graphics on the bottle and charge you the price of a steak dinner.  Not me.  I'll stick with Frank's.
Really respect the level of research that goes into the show. Also really respect the people that hero their way through the wings. Also really looking forward to the day a celerity tap out or walk out of the an interview, with a "fuck that!", after "Da'Bomb".
Ed Helms. Comedian. Gentleman. Closet masochist.
damn my mouth for watering.
This reminds me of the time Andy had to make himself cry for an acting gig🤣
Really surprised that Hot Ones got Ed Helms. Luv him in Tag, Hangover, and The Goods. Good show this week.
Ed Helm’s haircut is clean asf
Do yourself a favor and watch “Jeff who lives at home”
Ah yes. I love Egg Helms
Please do an episode with Mark Duplass.. A GOAT of an actor and super chill dude.
I like when they clap at the end
Was hoping he'd do the whole interview in his Nard Dog character.
Oh he so can just sit there and cry 😢 😭 👹💥❤️‍🔥
He was so fun!  "Don't bother."  HAHAHAHA!!!!
Props to the Nard Dawg for making it all the way!
You need to get Jocko or Rohan or the rock on this!
When da bomb came up while he was already dying 😂😂😂
I am still having difficulty watching hot ones, because of Sean's new teeth
I think you're getting pretty hard up on celebrities these days. Finding celebrities from the dementia unit isn't very PR. Do better! Nobody care if their butthole puckers if they have assistants to help them change.
22:20 both of their voices are quivering lol
Hey Phil, am I missing a tooth ?
Damn.  Ed Helms looks like he would say, "No, I don't think I will," in casual conversation.
Who can fly higher using their flappy ears - Helms or Stiller?
I love when the guests acknowledge the ability of Sean and his team to do a great interview through the most adverse conditions for both the host and guest. Great episode.
He's so cool!!
Maybe I love his characters or maybe it’s just him.
Pls do Keanu reeves
Snotty nose Ed
He has that perfect good old boy persona.  I feel like if you were sitting next to him on the plane he would have a quip ready before lift off.
It's funny that Beyond Insanity used to be where it ended
Ed is awesome! Love him
hes turning into j.k Simmons
Dude, I am not famous but I WOULD LOVE to be on this show. Hahaha but with boneless wings. If possible
I should have taken a pepcid before this.  That's a peak middle age statement.
“What do tigers dream of ?”
Nardwuar The Human Serviette
Did they call him Ed Helms? Don't they know it's Egg?
Hooooooooly SHIT the bots have gotten insane on YT.
Yoooo
Keanu Reeves FOR HOT ONES!
What is with this background music in the beginning? 😅
#2 On trending..... wow this show has come a long way.
He handled this extremely well
Yooo
Egg Helms is a champion!
We need Keanu Reeves.
i thought he would mention his days as a champion in the Cornell chicken wing contest
The Rock
Jason Sudeikis next!!
Im happy they have him on here now just Steve Carrel
I literally chugged a cup of milk just watching the beyond insanity moment...
Got the season 17 kit at the Williamsburg store in NY, and the Bomb sauce (Evolution) is different from the one in the show (beyond insanity). Which is hotter?
Ed’s really a big dork, good to see him outside of the Office and less Hungover!  Speaking of Ed, the other one, that Extra Mean Green is perfectly placed after Da’ Bomb.  Skip Da’ Bomb and try this sauce...it’s just as mean, but does have some good flavor!  I swear Smokin’ Ed nor Hot Ones is sponsoring this, but I wouldn’t mind it if they did..🤷🏼‍♂️lol
true story with ed and randy sounds like a rip off of true story with hamish and andy but maybe its a similar situation to the office
Damn when did he become a senior citizen
Love.  Love.  Love.
Now get Dwight on here
take a shot every time ed says "yummy"
Never seen a lot of Ed in the real world but wow, what an amazing guest! truly a special episode.
SUGGESTION:  spin a wheel of death to see how many extra dabs on some wings.  ALSO: mix all ten together for 1 wing sauce challenge
Man y’all gotta get adam driver on here
Big props to Ed for taking real bites
Every guest: wow this sauce is doing irreversible damage to my body and soul   Sean: haha
Please get nicki minaj on here
SNOOP DOGG
This is, the best interview period
Nard Dog!!!!
why are they sitting so far apart
Sean Evans probably has a huge whip collection
Why not one long, beer pong style table? The separation is weird!
Ed was funny as hell in the hangover 🤣
I wanna see whatever interview he had going on after this!
I admire Ed for not trying to eat around the last dab.
This liberal putz is awful to watch.
Another guest that takes manly bites instead of barely nibbling. I hate to see guest barely take a bite
Daaaaaaamn, i just saw Ed Helms and i already knew that i needed to click in this video /,,/
Ed my man
Wow! This guy is actually normal and likable!
I was initially not enjoying this interview a and then Ed decided to shit on banjos. now im done with it.
I laughed so hard at this one
Nervous , he pulled his own tooth out.
GET STEVE CARELL AND ALSO PLEASE GET THE KID LAROI ON THE SHOW
Love him!
Love Ed Helms, so glad to see him tackle the wings
Helms seems like the kind of guy who embarrasses the hell out of his kids, but all of his kids' friends love him and think he's hilarious.
I still can't get over how they straight up murdered and then sliced up his character in season 9
Sean was off his game, he's usually a little more playful. He didn't seem to be having fun with such an amazing guest, odd vibe. I'm wondering if maybe Sean was offended by Ed telling him he was churning too hard to create the question.  lol
well i got to 2:47 and realized ed helm is fuckin boring.
Sean has to cringe when they get to Da Bomb, everyone’s reaction is the same 😂
You should get ufc fighters on this show. Those types of personalities with this sort of challenge would be awesome
wait, 3D Chess? Isn't that... just Chess?
Something tells me Ed is looking for a bidet for his next bowel movmint...😥😰😭💩
I love when the research pays the bills.
"shut up about the god damned banjos, Helms…" love it! - also, y'all are BRINGING it with this season - kudos! - so much nose drainage … the best :-)
Seems like a lack of research from the other end of the table...
That show sounds bad. Love him though.
Please have smokin Ed currie on. It would be so entertaining watching two hot food legends get into it
Used to watch the office and for sum reason i never figured out its the same guy from hangover😂 must be the tities or teeth
We need Julian casablancas or st Vincent
Such a sweet, smart, cool guy
This man is a treasure.
OMG! I love Egg Helms so much
Idk if it just me but I’d be wiping dem wings cleans
Oh hey its egg helms
PLEASE CAN YOU DO KEANU REEVES!
When a guest comments on Da'Bomb's logo I know they don't watch much Hot Ones and I get scared
he might say the office was one of his highlights, but we all know the writers destroyed the Andy character because he kept taking long breaks to shoot movies in the later seasons.
AHH CLASSIC STEW!
In my opinion he will always be known as “the fire is shooting at us” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂💀💀🔝💀
Andy: eats last dab  Andy: I go by drew now
OMG he handled those wings like a champ! Lol. Also didn't know he did commercial voice overs. Very cool.
Wow he looks really vaccinated
Is Seans smile different...? Looks great
Ed Helms…
Love it. Get Ryan Reynolds on this show pls
Ed is great!
Whoever is reading this I hope your gaming is fun and your day is great !!
19:40 da blessing of da bomb
Good job Ed, but serious that can’t be worst then getting your tooth knocked out my Iron Mike Tyson.
Bring MattPatt on this show, he's been preparing
first time i thought i want to try all these sauce and you have it now, wtf
Queen Majesty Cocoa Ghost is so good.
I adore this man!!
Banjo and boiled peanuts? I am in heaven.
Is it just me or do they both seem stoned?
Who is the guy? (I don't watch tv especially Saturday night live due to horrible memories of it from 1990's... and also cause I could make the jokes they tell now; not so funny to me.  Still watching intrigued though. Then:  He plays banjo? *SWOON*🥰😍😲and ... he swims. ...aaahhhh and masochist. Gimme.  OMG and he was in a muppet movie. Wth
Andy lookin old
I love when he said “are you still trying to do this interview?” you can hear the background guys laugh lol
Ed was so hammered by this seasons wings but he rode it out like a champ, love to see it!
Can we get DR DISRESPECT on here!
I love Ed Helms. He seems very intelligent and down to earth.
I’m stoned out of my mind that episode was nuts  Ed done well in such a vulnerable state 🥴
I didn't see Da Bomb in that box lol
MrBeast should go on the show!
https://youtu.be/r5DuF8IKhco
i really wanted to like this one but damn is Ed Helms kinda boring.
Awww I needed this, it feels like home when anyone from the office pops up
Joe Rogan Jordan Peterson  Elon Musk Get them on!🤘👊🤞
I gotta say I enjoyed this so much, Ed is such a beast for completing this. Great episode
Fantastic interview, very enjoyable.
Sean struggled more than I’ve ever seen before lol
Always like your shows.  Why not have Daves Insanity????
I saw Edward in Ohigh the other day. He was eating ice cream at libby park, stoned out of his mind. Shout out to Sespe Collective
How do I turn off the crappy music?
Still waiting for the Security Dave episode (s5e1 for those new to the series).
Hello Dear
Nard Dawg is aging quite gracefully.
16:14 shawns face!!!!!
This guy is strong af
Egg Helms
Great watch. Ed is awesome. Rocked it.
That tooth story is hilarious 🤣
After watching this, it brought up Justin Timberlake...that reminded me of ANDY SAMBERG.  GET ANDY SAMBERG!
Wow, guess I’m the only one thinking he did an about face when he thought the cameras were off, huh? That “don’t bother” while walking away awkwardly (no outro?) sounded rude a.h.
I wish Sean would of said “Here comes Treble” when Ed was about to name his college acapella group
"This is so fun!... and harmful"
I wonder why don't people remove the ugly warts they get on their faces. Even this guy (a celebrity with good money) has a nasty Witch-wart on his nose and a couple more on his cheek. It's very unpleasant to look at.
title should be : Ed Helms eats wings the way he acts in every movie - like a p**sy
THE FIRE IS SHOOTING AT US!!!!!
I thought his name was Egg
Jesus Christ those stage lights are NOT helping Ed Helms. 😬😬
Boild peanuts:  get the medic Love you guys
Man he looks old now
Dabomb is so bad he chased it with puckerbutt😂😂
Bring Rainn, but as Dwight...
Invite matpat to hot ones before it’s too late
I was definitely hoping for a mention of the “Hopeless Wanderer” Mumford and Sons music video
Finally someone I actually want to see on Hot Ones!
Jason bateman next
8:20 "most of us play it kinda badly".....ummm yeah no Ed. Bela Fleck has entered the chat and vehemently disagrees.
Great show ...love the commercial  reading ....
Peacock? The failing media platform? Yeah.. thats s sinking ship to be on.
How has it been like 15 years and Ed looks exactly the same as he did in the office
Andy after the Office
Kathleen Madigan
'So you are telling me I'm going to die'  Yes....yes he was.
The comments on these videos always suck
He knows about ambulance chasing law firms!!!
❤️
Pretty sure it's Egg Helms
the ad I had to watch to see this, I am so insulted
Was that an office reference with the “ used to call me “ in the beginning
I think its time for Sean to be on the other side of the table...how about a contest for a fan to interview Sean?!?!
Looks very hot, because it's very spicy food. 😂😆😜😂
I love how they offered him the wings and he like yeah dog don't bother.   He looks like in such pain and in such like a food coma eating the wings, I honestly think he didn't even know where he was afterwards
this show is awesome and im really glad it lasted this long so far, we have tons of good actors and personalities that can still make it, Ed was struggling really hard btw but he completed the challenge!
I never clicked so fast :)
had no idea that was his name lol
is it just me or has Sean been struggling more with the hot wings ever since he's gotten his new teeth?
What the office writers  did to the Andy’s character sucked
Still saying nicknames from his past is GOLD! 😂
Amazing guy 👏👏👏💕
Hot Ones has definitely become a favorite of mine. I end up respecting the guests more after each show. Sean Evans was born to do this show.
i finally know of another person who was born without that front tooth, please let me know if they need an extra on set for H 4 :)
*Egg Helms. 😂
Instant classic episode. Couple of class acts 👍
The ad copy should have been throwback style for Hot Ones...
WOOOOO!!
PLEASEEEE PUT BRITTANY BROSKI ONNNNNN
I love Ed Helms since the Daily Show, but I am not getting peacock for the show he is promoting
Please get Matt Stonie on here 😂
Gotta do Jim a Dwight at the same time
We will fail every time; it is in our nature to SIN. It is only through the  BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST, that we can acquire complete forgiveness. We can all attain this by just accepting Jesus as our Savior, and accepting that He shed His BLOOD to atone for the sins of all who (REPENT).    Just ask  (for the BLOOD of JESUS for FORGIVE your SINS).   And then PRAISE the Name of GOD!  And then ASK God for what you need help with.  It REALLY WORKS.
You definitely have to get Matt from demolition ranch to come eat wings with you..... Please, it would be so funny
6:04 for a second I thought he was upset the tooth got brought up! 🤣
The 🐐
Anybody know what jacket Sean is rocking?
I also have a tooth implant in the front :)
todd packer
“A core crew of committed comedians” huh…
Guys…his name is Egg. Egg Helms.
Oh man. Can we get the guys from the trailer park boys on the show. Ricky, Julian, and bubbles .
Andy was one of the greatest, if not the greatest addition to the Office over the years. Guy is an improv great and his chemistry with that cast was tremendous.
“This is super fun. And cool. And… harmful.”  This should be the Hot Ones tagline. 😂
Does anyone know what interview he had after? I gotta watch it😂
Nard dog was fighting for his life !!
Amazing!
ed like a champ
Sean is the ULTIMATE host! Best questions!!! Y'alls research team is ABSOLUTELY TOP NOTCH!!!! MUCH LOVE ❤!!!!
This is genuinely one of the most wholesome things I’ve ever seen. He is so precious
When he talked about his college acapella group, for a split second i legit thought he would mistakenly say something about going to "Cornell".
I love Ed Helms!! Who else love his acting??
OMG i love Egg Helms
Ed, what a legend
What about broccoli Rob
Handled like a G
"And it's time to roll out the red carpet for you."  *no my friend*
👍👍 AWESOME! Such a good interview.
I literally didn't even know what his name was until now, but he is now one of my favorite actors. If I used Twitter, I would start following him. Big ups to Mr Evans too for his millionth baller interview. Props to the researchers and the staff too.
Once again is really impressive how Sean’s team does research on their guests. I wonder how many hours of research they do on each guest.
Interview Mark Weins!
There’s no way he said “shut up about the banjo” and Sean didn’t immediately reply “shut up about the sun! Shut up about the sun!”
he actually looks the same as he did in hangover in 2009.
So glad y’all brought up Jeff Who Lives At Home. Adore that movie so much!
Ed look high AF
Segura talked about the bomb on his podcast yesterday.
It’s Egg Helms!!!
Are you drunk? No this is Andy Bernard!
The least person on hot Hines I ever connected with. Weird.
Get Russ on this show
Boogers at 21.06 😪
honestly never knew this guys name but ive seen him in lots of stuff
Andy be lookin oooooold
Sooo good!
Nard Dawg!
You should do Markiplier, Jacksepticye, and Pewdipie hot ones video
That was Fun!  Ed Helms, a Renaissance Guy! He is, what it means to say, Brainy is the New Sexy!!  Great Questions! Love the Hot Ones Show!
I cannot stand the characters he plays... but I really find him endearing and real... goes to show he is a really good actor.
thats Egg
We need Bradley Cooper on the show
Great to see Egg Helms getting the credit he deserves!
I love Ed, he's such a great dude
Can you please tell us which or what his next interview was I gotta see how he handles that 👍🏼
Bradley Cooper when?
It's beginning to be incredibly contrived that people don't know what "Da Bomb" is. If they don't know it themselves their publicists definitely give them a heads up. It's ok that they know. The reaction is still genuine so why pretend?
What do tigers dream of
No way he’s that guy from tv lol
What a likeable guy ..👍🏻 😎 Both of them 🥰
Sean's starting to loose his edge
"This is super fan, cool, and harmful." Good job, Ed Helms.
egg helms
Perpetually on the look out for the guest complimenting Sean's questions.
His woke shows on peacock are pretty lame. Seems like he would of learned something being on The Office all those years.
I love how Da Bomb still has some affect on Sean, he's tasted it hundreds of times and his eyes still water.
starting to get those puppet lookin old people wrinkles
You having a tooth pulled for a roll beats anything you could do on hot wings
i must say something about Da Bomb , i was a cook in a local bar/grill and i made a chili with da bomb in it and i was once told by a truck driver from Texas that my chili was the best he ever had and i always attributed it to Da Bomb .  Good stuff just HOT and Long Lasting.
What a great dude. That was fun
Hey out of curiosity is there anyway you can promote a charity for us and those with R.S.D. / CRPS it's an incurable nerve condition to help thise with this!
2 tables apart yet you guys hug and take pics together after. quick the bs.
this one time, i ate some boiled peanuts, like a whole lot of them, and i like to got sick. know what i mean?
This is embarrassing for you guys, his name is actually Egg Helms.  Awkward, but we all make mistakes.
16:51 Don't touch your eyes!
Please get Rosamund Pike on the show.  Please.
Starts with an asbestos reference, ends with an asbestos commercial read!  An unintentionally deep full-circle cut for the great Ed Helms!
you need to do an interview with nardwuar. it would be so epic peoples minds would blow!!!
Really need to check out Ed's new show, also boiled peanuts are always a favorite traveling treat as someone who lives in Western North Carolina. Also pimento cheese is great on many things including solo.
we  have  joe   Rogan, and Ethan Evans........ best interviews of all time. Eat your heart out Brokaw  and Cronkite
Ha handled that like a boss
I honestly enjoy how the actors think it’s just eating wings during an interview, but you guys always do research and always have them leave with mad respect for the Sean the interviewer !
Please have Conan on!
Him and Zach would be perfect together on this show
I really really want them to have an eye napkin and a mouth napkin because that's the most stressful part of watching this show for me haaaaaaaaa
No questions about Aunty Donna!? what a missed opportunity lol but great interview as always
Heyyy it's Egg Helms
They should get Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey on here lol
This was a really good one
I would very much enjoy to see the next interview on Ed’s agenda or any hot ones guest. Please link these
Im done.. IM FREAKIN DONE.. im 30 and Andy did the Mesothelioma Ad i wathced when i was a teenager.. IM FUCKING DONE
Get AOC on hot ones
Now bring Steve Carell in the show
Not the Mesothelioma ad reading! 😂🤣
Yo Ed Helms aged like shit
I really want to see the interview he did after
@Firstwefeast can i have his unclaimed sauces 🙏🏽
Some ppl do not use hot sauce at all, I dont blame them for doin poorly on this show.
wtf is peacock
GET RAMI MALEK TO GO ON
Man Jim Breuer is looking sharp these days
What’s with the boogers lol
hold up man are you in charge of as we feast or only hot ones ????????
We need Michael Scott!
Ed is just an awesome human being, love the guy...😁👍🏼
THIS IS THE BEST HOT ONES INTERVIEW EVER!!!
Have yall asked Eddie Murphy??? He would be great!
STOP FUCKING IT UP!!! Why do you tease it with the best part of the episode...  I try to fast forward  but sometimes I don't get to it.
Dana white
Get Peyton Manning on here
11:10 I hate how he bit into that wing 🤦‍♂️ should of went in from the side.
“I just ate an entire seahorse” vibes
Tobias Boon would be a interesting one
My celebrity crush!😘💖💖💖💖
Ass Reaper….a Carolina Reaper sauce… 6 million Scoville. Skip the weak stuff…
What hold on what happened to the bomb they changed the bottle they can't just do that there's a little something called tradition and changing the bottle is not right and what the hell happened to the fiery Chipotle hot sauce that's the best hot sauce bring that s*** back it was Alton Brown's favorite and quite frankly it was my favorite too I've been watching you guys for a long time now I'm a little upset here LOL
"I have some gene that makes me love the banjo"  "My dad is from Alabama"  I think I know what the genes are 🤔
Love Ed, Hamish and Andy also did this concept a few years ago, cant wait to see Ed and Jims take
Dwight please
The game is rigged, Da Bomb, burnt tire dipped in acid, let's put it on chicken!
I'd be really interested in watching whatever interview Ed did after this. 😆
What a cool guy. Great guest great episode... John Cena!!!!!
That was just a super chill interview that I absolutely enjoyed. It's nice seeing interviews where everyone involved just seems so relaxed and respectful of each other.
"And we're gonna package up those sauces for you to take home."  "Don't bother."  LMAO!!
That’s what he gets for ruining The Office. While Steve leaving did not help, Ed taking over dragged it behind the woodshed.
snoop dogg plz
I love when the guests actually are invested in the sauces
Andy Bernard does not lose contests, he wins them. Or he quits them because they're unfair.
Here comes the "Guests impressed by Sean's question" compilation.
Ed Helms is a national treasure. We must protect him at all costs.
The Stratocaster guitar song that starts @ 9:02 is beautiful. Anyone know it by chance?
Ed Helms seems like such a nice guy. Really enjoyed this episode
Love Ed Helms Jason Sudekis would awesome too
What a genuinely nice dude Ed is. Thanks for having him on. I loved it!
WHY DOES HE LOOK OLD NO
“My brother always called me asbestos tongue” “They used to always called me Nard Dog” “I got straight B’s. They called me Buzz” “They used to call me Boner Champ”
Seeing the bottles on fire gave me an idea for a gag gift.  Someone should make Hot Ones candles, but the twist is the smoke has a pepper spray effect.  Making the everyone in the room suffer.
Office Ladies! I wanna see Jenna and Angela tackle the heat together, it'd be hilarious.
ANDY!!!
If you’re seeing this have a good night or day.
The Nard-dog😂😂😭
Just wanted to give a shout-out to Shawn great job and love the show big fan here I got some mouth cancer going on and got surgery set up for Monday and when I heal up I am going to buy a shitpot full of your hot sauce and I will be watching the show in the hospital and see if I can get some doctor's to eat some wings with me when I get better love you man 👍 and keep up the great work
Meh
Constructive criticism: The lighting is so harsh.   It’s distracting.
great interview, but you misspelled "Egg Helms"
Can’t believe they spelt his name wrong.  It’s “Egg Helmes” 🙄
We need Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds on this show oh and Chris Evans and Chris hemsworth
What interview did he go on next?
I can so just sit here and cry!
an honest man deserves the applause. I always wondered about his tooth during the OG days xD
I remember Hangover 2...he has aged as well as cheese on the roof of my condo.
One of my favourite episodes!!! Thank you Chris for showing your humanity in feeling da bomb 😂 and ah! I have some new films to watch with Ed ☺️
You gotta get Jomboy and Jake from Jomboy media. Fellow sports lovers and amazing chemistry in front of the camera
great episode
ed helms has been 40 for like the last 25 years wtf
I noticed after eating da bomb. Another hot sauce will take the taste away.. still hot but at least it’s a different taste 😂😂
Ed Helms has just entered the heat of Hellms
Does Ed helms always look faded lol
One of the best hot ones in a while
I feel like I can't focus on what Ed is saying because all I can hear is this unnecessarily loud (and really just unnecessary) music.
It’s fucking awesome seeing actors and actresses on this show using there skills on da bomb. Haha they break then their good a few minutes later 😂
So much fun! Love him! Thank you for being so brave 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Deep cuts only!
LOVED this!! :)
Im here for DA BOMB fans.. Put me on top! 16:04❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
I thought his name was Egg Helms
I'm not a big comment writer but this felt so deserved. Hot ones is one of my favourite shows and as an autistic person it's one of my biggest comforts - and the office has to be my number one comfort show! I was so excited to see ed helms on this and watched immediately and it's definitely one of the best episodes :) As always, sean you are an interviewer and host way beyond your time and ed, you are such an amazing, talented person! such a good one :)
Bring mike tyson
Love how he started off about a nickname lmao classic andy
It's funny how they have two tables so that the Karen's won't complain that they are too close without a mask.  Actually catering to morons.  An additional table will not stop you from getting the flu, a cold or corona.  If you have a hearty laugh, which they do, particles will fly.
My wish is that he starts singing his acapella
I swear Sean and the team have found this magic formula with their questions. They found this sweet spot of: a story that the fans want to hear, but more importantly, a story that the guest really wants to share. Like it was a point in their lives that not many people ask them about, but that means so much to them. Hence why they are taken back by the great question. PS - Another great show team. Ed was, of course, fantastic. Keep up the awesome work!
I really want to watch the interview he did after this one. Does anyone know what it was?
Ed Helms is slowly aging into Woody from ToyStory.
Have Steve Carrell!!!
You know I think I’m at a point where I’d just like to see regular, every day people experience this and get interviewed
Can we please see the office ladies??? Angela and Jenna TOGETHER
I love how every celebrity says “wow you really did your research” kudos to you sean!!!
Uncle Roger or GTFO
the wings look of better quality than they have. hotones upping the game
Ed has left the chat.
“And we’re going to pack up the sauces for you” “Don’t bother”
Lets get Daniel Radcliff AKA Harry Potter :p Or Emma Watson!
4 drops… Respect !
Yesssssss Ed Helms:D
It was interesting to hear Ed Helms' voice slowly turn into Tim Allen's.
Can someone tell me why that Coco Ghost wing looked so damn good? idk what it is about it.
Sean might interview all of Hollywood lol.. C'mon he interviewed Halle Berry 🍓. Everybody wanna be apart of something. Followers SMH
Sean it's time to flick a few random street peep's into the mix . The star's are by far amazing always , but to just bring in a few randoms with zero cred would be interesting ????
my dream is to make it on this show
Why so many only fans links
"Hey, we'll package up those hot sauces for you to take home."  "Don't bother."  He's worn out.
He looks like the old man character he played in the office
Ed Helms is great, it was fun leaning more about him.
Another great episode! How long does an average shoot take?
I love when the guest comments on the quality of Sean's questionssssssss
Okay, I lost it at 18:30 😂 Poor Ed is trying so hard to answer the question normally but is straight up dying inside.
Can we get Jordan Belfort on this!
Here's a "Sean is such a good interviewer" comment 😭 Really tho, like if you'd like to see Sean get a raise
Hes such a badass actually!!
Ed killed it 🥳
Yes! Ed Helms! One of my all time favs!  Great interview, great questions.
Ed has always been underrated! What a shame.
Still waiting for the la beast
If you ever want to convince someone that a banjo is great.. Show them Bela Fleck 😍
Hey that packaging is beautiful nice job.
Sorry who is Ed helms? It's Egg helms guys
Scheduling other interviews after Hot Ones -- rookie move; fire your PR team.
did sean get dentures? he sounds a little lispy/slurry
Me sitting here editing a Voice Over gig I just did while having NO CLUE Ed was a VO guy
16:00 "Da Bomb" 🔥
This was so good
Was the Ad read out at the end a call back to asbestos tongue that his brother used to call him or just a happy coïncidence? Your team does such insane research I can't even tell anymore!!!!!!
wow hes gotten old since hangover
I gotta say he seems like a really great guy. Also he handled himself really well. Stand up guy.
I would love to see the whole The Office Cast on Hot Ones
Cornell's only Andre Bernard, jk love Ed Helms tho
The exit had me dying💀. He did not want to stay at all. He looked like he either had to shit himself or he was about to pass the hell out. Someone, anyone GO CHECK ON ED🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for that - he was great!
Ed is going to murder his agent now
+1 for the Nard-Dog!
Did Ed Helms knock back the hot sauce goodie-bag at the end?
Drunk af while watching this but, beylamfagom toolangufulu
Shout out to acapella!
After DaBomb Ed started sounding like Tim Allen.
Ed Helms! Total comedy legend and a real gentleman!
Best episode yet! Ed is charming and great!
I would want to see the whole cast of the office do this as their character
Please invite Zach Galifianakis !!! <3
I didn't know this guys name before watching this
lets be serious - almost all of these high tier celebrities are starting to come on the show simply because when hot ones asks them, the celebrity looks up his vids to see if its worth it; then see every. single. video. of the people being interviewed complimenting Seans questions and instantly agree right away because they know they have ZERO fear of losing their credibility, all while getting to answer some really awesome questions no-one would've ever known about them! Kudos Sean, keep it up!
Get more The Office crew!
Would have for sure thought he was going on the wall of shame but Ed handled those like a champ.
Nard dog
What an incredibly pleasant guy Ed is, love him :)
23:14 who else saw him rub his eye with his spicey fingers
Hey Sean, when will european viewers be able to buy stuff like to season 17 hot sauce lineup from EU origin to avoid paying $100 through customs??
The real show would be seeing these celebrities in the bathroom later!
I want to see the other interview as well to see the after hot ones effect
Great episode and great guest!!
one of the best interviews! i used to love to hate andy but he is amazing and now i just love him. everyone finds him annoying but thats the whole point. ed helms is a master
One of my favs this. He comes across as more of a guy you could have a pint with than a celebrity.
Ed didn't want the hot sauces (end says don't bother)? Send them to me, I'll gladly take his hot sauce donation!
"Fun and cool and harmful" may be the best descriptor of this show that I've heard. Lol
U have to have Jason on now😂
Evans insides are immune to harm and foreign invaders. His immune system will ride-up on anything it needs to. His cells all look like 300.
Ed Helms looks a lot like Buster Keaton.
We need Jason Sudeikis
He gave me Tim Allen vibes here. He looks and sounds like him when Tim was younger. If you were to tell me that he was Tim Allen's son I wouldn't question it
Would have to disagree with Ed as a fellow southerner - there is no such thing as good pimento cheese.  It's all nasty.
Ed Helms saying his brother calls him Asbestos Tongue is the most Andy Bernard thing in the world
I don't think he is ever coming back for another season.. lmao
Damn allllllllll the research sean does, and he couldnt find that his name is egg helms
My only wish is to be famous enough to be interviewed on Hot Ones
I can't believe Sean got his name wrong the ENTIRE INTERVIEW
Who is this guy and what’s with all the nickity names
Glad to see them do this in person again.
He corNAILED this
I can’t believe you’ve spelt and pronounced his name wrong, his name is obviously Egg Helms
Tell Dropkick Murphys and FLogging MOlly that banjos and accordions suck
You should bring Randall Park on too!
great interview but he seemed kind of dickish towards the end there?
Does anyone have a link to the interview Ed had after this one?
who the hell is ed helms? all i see is andy bernard
Great job!!!
Roo do do do dooo!!!!!!
I love Ed!  But it looks like someone CGI'd his face onto Seth Meyer's body for this interview
Hoping he touches his eye with the spice and washes his eyes in the end credits..
Sean I the best there ever will be 🤠
What a gem
“There’s nothing redeeming about that” lol the music went for the wholesome emotions on this one
I feel like this show needs a hidden camera for when these celebrities walk out of the building, so we can see there face of regret as they walk to there ride lol
I’d want to come on here just to try the vegetarian wings they have ahah
damn i love egg helms
I have a huge respect for really good banjo players. Like Ed said, its difficult to make the Banjo sound good and not over power the other instruments. Bluegrass done right is so lovely to listen to.
Interview Jared Keeso! Or even better, interview WAYNE!!!   "Just let that (wing) marinate for a bit."
The nard dog!!!!
Ed Helms is the man!!! This was an awesome episode ❤️
The way Sean laughs before Da Bomb because knows what's coming🤣
That's not a biohazard symbol, thats a radiation symbol Andy
Why is John Krasinski not credited for being in the show with Ed?
*Egg Helms
You gotta get spiceking on here even if he ain’t famous famous.
Ed looks great still. Not aged a whole lot from the office
Is no one talking about how this absolute unit came back for a SECOND bite on the last wing?? And with no reaction whatsoever!!!
I need you to understand how big your mark is on pop culture from The Office and Hangover alone. You sir, have forever changed how I exit a monologue, conversation or even a room. So, thank you.  "ok, byeeee."         - Ed Helms
22:24  The moment you actually wait for during every hot ones interview
sean can you please get mr. andrew garfield on the show this season?? i'll love you forever
Rettatataduu
I love the subtle record player stopping when Ed noticed wing #2 was hotter than he expected
Ed Helms rules! Love the Office and Hangover!
Bro we need Andrew Garfield
Get Uncle Roger on the show!!!
Ain’t gonna lie Ed looks like when Andy dressed as an old man for that audition
I want any of the Queer Eye guys on here!!!
I’m watching this as hangover is on fox tv haha
dang it went from 1800 to 7000 that fast..what happen to 2800 or 3500 or 4000......dang that is insane...can't do it...i can't even do 150 scoville
When are you going to bring on the 6 foot 8 gaming great, two time back to back 1993 1994 block buster videos game champion and true international video game super star Dr. Disrespect?
Just had some last dab with my eggs this morning! Skipped the coffee cause that stuff wakes your ass up!
Nicolas Cage, Tom Cruise, Gérard Butler. My wish list for this show.
I hope Ed got tested…  For that  Bangkok tattoo ink inside him….
How does Sean have intestines?
Omggggg I flipping died when you got to the Pucker Butt bwahahahahaha 😆 🤣 😂 💀☠️
I have a new found love for this guy. What a champ.
The beauty of this interview is that I find comedians when in the public spotlight always feel the need to constantly be funny. Like everything they say has to be hilarious. We know Ed Helms is funny, he knows we know he is funny. So we just got a chat with Ed Helms not feeling the need to try too hard. This was class and humbling.
ED!! YAAAAYY!! Thank you @firstwefeast for bringing this gem on the show!
ED HELMSSSSSSSSSSSS WHAAAT
8:45 "Shut up about the Sun!"
Ed big fan rolled with the wings of death like a champ
I too never grew in my top adult incisors
Is that Egg Helms?
Guys, his correct name is Egg Helms. Egg, not Ed.  https://youtu.be/aNVYDluxQr0
Hero
This guys is literally andy in real life. He was in an Acappella group and a Banjo playing fanatic 😂😂
Ed is the best, so glad they got him on here!
He seems like a wholesome person
I always wanted to see him suffer fr.
What a lovely guy.
Why has ED not done a banjo battle with Steve Martin???  Someone get on this there may be a funny add or even a movie there...
Don’t bother… 😂
this is the BEST interview show on the platform EVER, how we get the most RAW form of each celebrity !!!! THANKS
Picture a campfire 🔥 at night in the middle of the woods.   Group A. Are the people closest to the fire. They are huddled around it. They can easily see the light of the fire, feel the warmth of the fire, and hear the soft sound of the fire crackling.   Group B.  They moved far from the fire. They can no longer see the light, feel the warmth, or hear the sound of the fire.  Our relationship with God/Jesus works the same way. Some don’t believe in God or have a strong relationship built on faith because they have strayed so far from Him. They can’t see His light, they can’t feel His warmth, and they can’t hear Him calling them.   As Christians:  We are to light candles 🕯and torches from the main fire (God/Jesus), and use God’s light to go look for those that are far from the light. We are to lead them out of the cold darkness. Not to Judge them, but to love them. That’s the love of Jesus Christ ❤️‍🔥working in us!
Andy was my favorite!
It would've been perfect if he did a car extended warranty read.. just saying
I was all Chipotle behind Ed Helms once and he ordered "Dos tacos por favor".
What do tigers dream of, when they take a little tiger snooze... Do they dream of mauling zebras, Or Hally Berry in her Catwoman suit
ED eating more of the wings then Sean massive respect dude
True story is just ripping off hamish and andy in australia
That can't be Andy, more like Andy's dad.
Bring on the Spice King
Good old Egg Helms
Sweet! Steve Carrel next! :)
Dont Bother 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣
What a fun interview. I didn't it was the dude off the hangover lol. This episode was entertaining to watch 😅 the mouth medic part made me laugh 🤣 😂
that dude is still alive?
sean is the goat honestly
These videos are truly a highlight of my weeks, every time they drop.
Can we have MIA on here
This whole time I never knew his actual name lol
Fran Lebowitz would be hilarious on this show...if you could get her.
You should out the bomb second to last cause you never really get the effect of what the hotter sauces do to your guests
Glad to see Andy and Jim are making a new show together!
Are you wondering if the show is fake now? hahahaha
“ …don’t bother.”🤣😂🤣
"Are you seriously trying to do this interview still!?"  🤣🤣🤣
ugh the spaced out tables. news flash: you're not gonna die and you look ridiculous
Ed Helms was just acting like himself in The Office.
I'm here for Da Bomb reaction.
"My brother called me asbestos tongue"  Is Ed in character as Andy?
I love seeing guests' happy reaction when Sean brings up a not so popular project of them, you can see how proud they are of their work and it shows in their excitement, this episode was so wholesome.
Woodysgamertag, wow!
Wow I didn't know I needed to see this!
Egg!
I love Ed so much! What a great interview
Really like Ed. However I feel like he has that vibe comics talk about where on camera they are sweet but back stage they will backhand staff for not having their coffee at the right temp. Again, I prey I’m wrong cause he seems down to earth n cool
What an amazing performer! Ed you’ve inspired me for years and keep on with everything you legend!
Still hoping for a Ryan Reynold episode
When he said “I’m not angry yet”, gave me flashbacks to when he stuck a hole in the office wall
just because Ed Helms reminds me of Cyril Thiggis from Archer, you should ask Cyril (and also Jerry from Rick n Morty)'s voice actor to come and do the show
Wow! Ed Helms nailed his turn on the seat. Great interview as usual too. Ed seems like a regular dude to me. I love his comedy. Great episode.
a whole office reunion even partial would be hilarious!
So adorable
Hamish and Andy selling True Story to the US…must be nice, must be veryyy nice
Would love to watch whatever publicity he had to do next
IT'S THE NARD DOG!!!
He killed the last one. Did he flip the wing lol.
Did he even drink any water…lol. He did great and he was funny!  I love learning things about the people he has on…always so interesting!
Can’t believe he managed them all!
i guess ima sadist cuz da bomb makes me laugh every time
"Dont bother!" LMAOOOOOO!
Number 4 on trending! Good job guys
Yes I love EGG helms!
The NARD-DAWG!! 🤩
What's a sentence that feels dirty after you add this "😏" to it?  Ed Helms: I'm throbbing 😏.
Get all 3 spiderman on this showwwww
Where does tapatio fall on the line there? zero position? what about del taco fire sauce??
This dude funny asl✌🏾😂
I just have to say it.  After Da' Bomb, this man has a demon in him!
HEAR ME OUT WHAT IF YOU INTERVIEWED NARDWUAR
I love Ed but when the hell did he start looking so old! Yes I know people age but I’m just in shock!
I love the appreciation the guests have for the effort put into the questions
I fucking love Ed!!!!
would love to see Adrienne Houghton on Hot Ones
Please get Andrew Garfield on this show
Seeing Sean using his sleeves to wipe his eyes, proves that he is actually a human being, and not just a 🌶️ fueled machine!😂
Andy! Good job! Glad you made it through them all.
“Oh chocolate 🍫!” Lol
Sean’s hand movements weird me out
You sure thats not Philip  DiFranco?
He just seems like such a sweet person  :)
ok but jim and pam would be amazing as a truth or dab
16:46 WHUT
SS web has the best banjo
I knew it!!! Guy from hangover!
The bomb falls to the bio symbol again *sigh*
Egg helms
Im gonna watch this Andy & Jim Show
I want to know what interview he’s going to next so I can watch it and see if you can tell he’s suffering 🤣
Thought Ed was getting emotional about his tooth 🤣
Well now we need Jason Sudeikis
It’s the “don’t bother” at the end for me 😂
Ed is awesome great interview
I would have to put them on something other than chicken cause I don’t eat the devils poultry.  Not vegan, just anti chicken. Makes me sick, what else do you recommend these sauces on. Just kidding, I will put it on anything (but chicken)
Cant stand Ed Helms! He is not funny at all and has a very annoying face
Actually is Egg Helms but good vid none the less
LOL ... "Don't bother." killed me. I hear that, Ed.
14:20 incredible reflex acting after that loud smash
Yet another great interview with both of them really enjoying it apart from the pain 👏🏻
Staffer: we’re going to package up the sauce’s for you. Ed : Don’t bother. Best last word ever.  😂😂😂😂😂
GET STEVE CARELL ON HERE
Oberlin.  That explains a lot.
"something incredibly mundane can be so funny if it's told really well"  _deja vu kicks in_  **Office theme intensifies**
I can't unhear Ted from the lorax it's ingrained at this point 😂
literally only know this man from The Office
I think this is the only podcast/interview show I watch because of the host instead of the guests
I can’t with the flame edit 😏
Really looks by the looks of this that his people didn’t line him up well.  He had no clue what was about to happen haha
This sucked. Couldn’t even keep me entertained for two minutes
we stan andy bernard!
Andy Bernard is my favorite character to pick apart and it makes my heart so that he made that possible. 💜
Such a good guest. Love it.
i can too, just sit here and cry!!
Egg
Ed is a champ.  I don't think I've ever seen a guest on this show sweat and leak as much as him but he keeps plowing on!
Wait... I thought it was Egg?
Man, Ed jumped ship well before Trevor Noah sunk the daily shit show.
I got a sympathetic runny nose just watching this one.
jeeeez Ed Helms what a champion. Way to power thru!
Ed Helms, Jason Sudekis, Ryan Reynolds and John Mulany are some of my favorite people in the world!
I never understand how people still "have things to do" after being on this show.  I'd be like, this is All that I'm doing today....and I'm taking tomorrow off, too! The only thing I have "planned" for the next 36 hours are bubble-guts and fire-shits. Give me loose pajamas, Netflix, and a tub of ice cream while I recover from being on Hot Ones. LOL
I love this show so much, one of the few things I look forward to.
“Called me asbestos tongue”? Lie again Ed Helms. We all know they called you Ace. Or Buzz.
First
Ed looks incredibly high while doing this interview, ha ha.  Probably the only way he could get through eating all that spice!
The best episodes - where hosts always repeats "great question" or "wow you did good research". Nice!
I'm still waiting for the Keanu Reaves interview
Awesome!
Holy shit the Mesothelioma ad comes full circle hahahaha
This dude seems pretty chill. Hope he doesn’t flip out and punch a wall over these wings
DWIGHT
Nardwar and Eminem are the two I most want to see on this show.
Hes gonna punch a hole in the wall
Sean definitely said POT Ones during the last 10 seconds of the video haha
Lol it’s always fun seeing someone think they’re doing we till they hit dabomb
Always a favourite. ❤️🙌
"Things are coming out of my mouth .. I can barely feel it."    Things will be coming out of a different place fairly soon  .. and, you will definitely be able to feel it.
Here’s a fun challenge. Name the sauce with the scovile level that is closest to your income.
He says his borther called him asbestos tongue but i thought they called him "ace" or "buzz"
Get Bear Grylls
We NEED to see Kanye West on Hot Ones. That could easily be one of the best episodes ever
Can you do one with Eminem?
I literally paused this to watch "Jeff, Who Lives at Home", do it! Its free on Amazon Prime, so good. Ed and Jason fucking nail it!
Happy to see Bread Helms on Hot Ones.
How much money do you charge the companies that produce the sauces you feature on your show? 20k+?
I didn't know I liked Ed Helms so much.....weird
Ed Helms didn't disappoint. A good man who can take a punch.
I hate how the cut all the time. I totally ruins the flow of the conversation.
Ed: this is doing permanent damage Sean: *nodding his head like Jack Nicholson in The Departed*
I have loved watching Ed for a long time.  Great talent and know I know even more great facts.  Great job Sean!
Ed just feels like one of those really chill dads
Gotta get Brian Shaw or Eddie hall on this show
When are you interviewing Nardwuar???🥸
Im going to say it one more time as the guests:what an amazing skill in investigate,research and make the best questions ever!Thanks Sean...5k views, 1.8 k comentaries in 5 hours you post the show!WE LOVE YOU SEAN!WE LOVE HOT ONES!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏BEST SHOW EVER!
Dude. Ed just seems like such a cool guy
Drew and Jim in a new show!!?? Nice!!
Sean actually looked like that DaBomb wing caught him real good this time haha. Awesome interview as always.
There's no way Los calienties is 49000. Shits not spicy at all
Yo!!!! Can't believe y'all got Egg Helms!!! Egg is the best
i would love to see ed's next interview after doing this show ......... love from hamilton ontario canada
Jim Carrey next!
I'm so cut that Hamish and Andy didn't get a shout out for pioneering True Story in Australia! Comedic legends!!
It’s Egg Helms
??????  Did he take the hot sauces or not?
Hell ya NARD DOG beat the wings!!
Cool guy 😎
Love these interviews  Bring Nicolas cage please
Wait, wait, wait! I thought his name was EGG Helms?
The Undertaker theme song was a great affect
It doesn't taste g....owww owwww
Great interview. Ed is one of the best and one of my favorites!
Hang Over 2 😆😆😆
FYI True Story was created in Australia by Hamish and Andy. Thank you 🙏🏼
Always hated andy.
My face has a heartbeat. 😂
Ritiditidoo!
19:20 LOL dont know if this was supposed to be a joke or not but the delivery was so funny on that line
I've gotta say that "True Story" sounds similat to Middleditch and Schwartz (in the best way!)
He got "nard-dogged".
It's Egg!  Egg Helms!
I love Egg Helms
19:45 "What makes it easier to eat hot things is if you chew them; your saliva is an integral part of the digestion of capsaicinoids", Smoking Ed Curry.
Holy crap that professionalism from Helms at the end!
There needs to be awards for the celebs to achieve, clean the wing award and most daring sauce award etc.
GET DAVE GROHL FROM FOO FIGHTERS ON HOT ONES TO PROMOTE THE NEW FOO FIGHTERS MOVIE 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
Ayyy you got the Boner champ on! Im impressed 👏
Ed Helms needs to be in Ted Lasso! I'll let Ed and Jason hash out the details, but how could it not be great?! ❤
“Don’t bother” at the end killed me
All I hear is Andy Bernard.
I don't think he's coming back. Ever.
Timely! Just finished my umpteenth re-watch of The Office. Ed is such a funny gentleman 🤗🤗🤗
This is the only type of interviews where I actually watch all celebrities and learn about them. Best show.
Ed did a great job he really surprised me, but also I have to say that Sean is without a doubt an absolute BOSS at interviews and this show.
Don't Bother 😂😂😂
It’s easy to forget that Sean is eating the spicy wings too!! I kinda didn’t even think about for the last few episodes…. It’s the first time in AGES that I’ve seen Sean struggle a bit!! 😅
A big mistake was made at 16:20
Damnnn he got old…. F that means I got old … f
Love Ed Helms!! Absolutely adore Andy Bernard 🤣🤣🤣👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 such a sweetheart!
When he said, "My brother called me asbestos tongue." all I can think about are all the times Andy would say, "They use to call me...."
A bit of an awky goodbye, Ed was out of there.
This is amazing lol
I wanna see peacemaker on hot ones
You should try getting Joe Rogan  on this show. Interview an interviewer.
Sean is hands down the best interviewer. his questions are head and shoulders above any other interviewer i've sen
17:39
he’s such an awesome guy, i love Ed
Lmao that's why RLM hates Jeff He Who Lives At Home
I get how every hot sauce “tastes” different but I imagine the hotness or spicy-ness compounds on the tongue.
When was the last time someone didn't finish the whole gauntlet?
Awesome, two full length ads that I can’t skip
Looking forward to his new show and he did great! Love when people have a good time on the show and are thrilled about the questions 👏👏👏
i think this is the first tim ei see Ed Helms not as a character and hes oddly normal
It's Egg, Egg Helms. Get your facts straight.
Excuse me but his name is Egg Helms.
snoop if its not too much to ask ehehhe hope u could get him pls ehhehe
I feel like this is 20 or 30 scorpions lolol
Chris Evans is a MUST!!!
An impressively honest individual:  We need more of this.
I wonder if Jim Carrey would ever come on..
25:02 Did Sean just say "Pot Ones"? I would love to see that show!
What is Andy Bernard doing here?
I wanna see the game grumps
Still rooting for Ryan Reynolds’s after all this time
He is the once-ler as well
Criminal that he didn't admit Hamish and Andy did True Stories first in Australia. We've all assumed the boys sold the rights to America.
Please try and get  Conan Anna Kendrick Aisling Bea James McAvoy Don Cheadle
Steve Martin playa the banjo, it’s charming and has it’s place in blues and bluegrass which is such a deep American sound,. It’s got a time and a place
He was the Voice of those Commercials!!! 😱😱😱😱
Lololololol all millennials love the mesothelioma ad!
The whole nine Nards
Love Hot Ones! Ed Helms is great! But f*ck Intuit for fighting free tax filing legislation for 20+ years.
Great job!
He truly IS Andy Bernard!
sit at the same table for gods sake
..."Don't bother!" 😂🤣
Ed looks really really tired.
You know it's going to be a good episode when he doesn't really know about it and is just on a press day hahaha
Not sure who this Ed Helms guy is but he  sure reminds me of Egg Helms a lot.
Hello hot ones. Please invite matt pat . Thank you
You need to get Danny Trejo on Hot Ones. The man is a legend.
Man, Ed Helms comes across as such a great guy. Just seems like such a wonderful person to spend time with or work with. Funny, genuine, caring. Awesome.
Get that Ted Lasso guy in there. Great interview
shout out to boiled peanuts!
I'd like to Craig Furgason, hope I spelled his name right.
Cool! Andy's got a new show with Asian Jim :D
I just realised I style my hair exactly like Ed Helms lol
But if he's been murdered by extra hot sauces.... Well, then we're shit out of luck.
ive gotta admit; the overall wing quality looks really good!; not spongey and fat but all meat
Omg Ed is amazing!
What another great interview!
Ed is such a likable person. It’s refreshing that not all Hollywood types are complete aholes
this guy seems so godamn wholesome, its nuts. like the radest neighbor
I love Ed Helms
egg!!!!!!
Andy Bernard is a really good actor, he really made the Ed Helms guy seem real
So odd seeing people still social distancing.
lol "Don't bother." I hear ya Ed!
LOL I love the sweet music in the beginning
Never liked his character in the office but I like him , nice dude
True Story was an Australian show by Hamish and Andy that they've simply purchased and remade... I wish they'd say that and not act like they came up with this brilliant new show idea
if i would ever encounter ed helms i would just smile and no word would come out , just admire the legend
#HotOnesS17 #JustEatTheWings!!! #HesThatSerious. #NoChanceToDie!!!  #RLSKnowsAll. #MouthMedicNeeded. #DontBuckTheTradition.
Wow Andy really made it
Great interview as always, please please bring Jimmy Carr to the show¡¡
Ed: "The front of my face is throbbing, this is doing permanent damage." Sean: *Nods excitedly*
That’s Egg Helms, not Ed
Los Calientes Rojo is my husband's fav sauce, man puts it on everything. I'm a wuss and it's too hot! I do love Keith's chicken sauce....that may be my #1
Definitely another fine example of Hot Ones adding dimension to the personality of the guest :)
Not from the office, but will you be able to get Jon Stewart....? That was great!
I want to see Cesar Millan (the dog whisperer) on hot ones
Love this dude he's funny
Still waiting to get used to Sean with those new teeth.  Very noticeable still.  Bit of a Lisp.
I got a three pack of Hot Ones sauces from Heatonist from my sister for Christmas. The Classic is awesome. Amazing flavor, with moderate heat. Los Calientes was pretty good on flavor, and still not overly hot. The Last Dab XXX kicked my a$$. The flavor was still good, but the heat just killed me. I've used up half the bottle of the Classic.I am keeping the Last Dab XXX around for my pepperhead friends (and I will overload what I put on for them). I have absolutely no interest in trying da' Bomb.
Ed Helms is so charming and humble I knew his interview would be so good!
Only 120$ for ten hot sauces that's a pretty good deal considering.
I always wonder why da bomb isn't the last sauce since it clearly is the sauce that hurts people the most and is absolutely my favorite part of every episode
I'd love to see some other members of the Jon Stewart cinematic universe on here - Mr. Oliver could be fun.
Now I wanna see Zach galifianakis on hot ones
Woo! Lets go Andy!!
Best line in the entire show "Don't Bother" LOL
I like that he comments on how good the questions are
Wow. Ed really got taken out.
hope one day we will see Harry Mack sît fire while eating fire on hot ones !
The Office is like good memories you never want to lose , I get emotional over that show...best TV in history imho.   Ed's Charecter added new energy , Dwight and Andy's relationship with Angela was hilarious.
I haven't watched in awhile, almost forgot how amazing this show is! It's amazing how your able to make something so simple so interesting. Also shout out to the sound and music design the way it builds with the heat is just great
NARD DAWG !!! he went full full gator on this one! PAR~KOR!!
YAY A GUEST I KNOW
Roo doo doo do doo!
#HotOnesS17 #WelcomeMisterHelms. #NowWeKnow. #FieryCarCrash!!! #RiseToHisLevel. #FunnyMightNotHelpYa!!!  #BeVeryNervous. #ThatNumberTwo. #SuchVisceralComedy. #OhThatAfterburner!!!
this pops up right after i finish watching the hangover trilogy 🤔
Good to finally see The Nard Dog on here 🔥
What a rookie. Hasn‘t seen a single show. All the beginners faults, remarks ..etc. Shame..love him as an actor anyway..
Poor Andy 🤣
Sean is one of the best interviewers alive.
Highly recommend watching True Story with Ed and Randall. It is an absolute delight!
Nard Dog!
Egg Helms
Damn my dude is getting old
Top 5 episode for sure.
Mimosas cure spicy mouth.. YOU GOTTA DRINK A MIMOSA ITS THE ONLY WAY
Oh wow I can’t believe they got Jason Sudeikis on Hot Ones
without Ed Helms, The Hangover movies would have absolutely sucked. He is in all the best scenes.
How does the banjo player know if the stage is level?         He drools out both sides of his mouth 🤤     But seriously, Look up Luca Stricagnoli banjo if you want your mind blown.
Egg Helms!
The special effects on these never disappoint. The echoes, zooming in, etc. all top notch
I love banjo music, you can't be in a bad mood listening to somebody jam out on those strings; it's not easy, so respect the banjo! Lol
Is that Egg Helms?
I loved it! I didn’t expect any less from Andy Bernard.   I was thinking though, what if the guests are provided paper napkins that they can use and then toss so they’re not having to be inevitably burned by reusing the same cloth napkin. But then again, that must be a part of their bit too.
Why is this the first time I'm noticing how big Sean's feet are???? 🤣😂🤣
I peeped the “exterra” swimsuit as he standing next to Dwight.  Office fans know what’s up.
John Krasinski next?
This made my day! I would love to see Rainn or Steve on some day.
i know it's 1:1, but would be cool to see a "group" interview with Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, etc
poor Ed, he never wants to see hot sauce ever again, "don't bother." XD
Ppl I wanna see on here: The Rock Donald Glover Joe Rogan  Vernon Supreme  Nardwuar  Elon Musk Morgan Freeman Anne Hathaway
damn he looks old
How did ed age so fast :(
What a great quote 4:05   Theres no were to go but up ❤💯
it's so nice to see Andy Bernard and Jim Halpert team up in a new TV show
Roo Doot Doot Doo Doooo!
Sean's "Shout out Oberlin" before Ed could say it was SHARP!
Tried the “apollo” sauce shit is not a joke I spit it out so quick
jeff who lives at home lowkey a hidden gem of a movie
I only know this man as Stu from Hangover, so even I appreciated all the questions that were about something other than The Hangover. Awesome interview!
Ed Helms did Fantastic he made it to the end without bitching and crying like chef Ramsey 👍🏻
11:25 These kind of connections Sean makes between his questions and the wing-eating theme makes this show amazing.  I know he's been told many times he has a unique way to interview but it never ceases to amaze me.
Put ur seat belt on.  Comedy surrounds us daily.  Txs 🇨🇦
Ed looks like he could be Ryan Reynolds’s dad.
Sean he gave you the perfect "in" to talk about your new chicklets!
Love Ed, this is already one of my favorites. But the level of research that Evans does and that questions he brings to the table never cease to amazing. Awesome
"Are you seriously still trying to do the interview right now??" 😂😂😂 That Beyond Insanity sauce always gets them
somebody needs to run that mass reporting tool that linuxtech showcased on this channel
Seriously don't vare about his movies, seriously liked him.
A pimento cheese sandwich is the bomb ! Been a long time tho!
" *Don't Bother* " ~ Ed Helms 2022
Lewis Black would be the best on this show!
As someone that has tasted "da bomb," I can attest to the claim EVERYONE makes about it being irredeemable. Not only is it hot, it does not taste good.
i bought season 16 and find it more tasty than a comical spice. They are delicious. Even the 9th one is good.
Ed Helms , one of my favorite Comedians
Damn, he nailed that ad read.
get rid of the flames on the bottles
Eminem needs to get in the hot seat
Invite Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield onto hot ones I think that would be so sick
We're gonna package up those sauces for you to go home..."Don't bother!" HAHAHA!!!
Ed Helms!! Excellent episode!!
🔥💪🏽💪🏽
I love the mesothelioma bit
.@hotones Do you guys film more Explain That Gram and just dont air it? Or does sean sometimes just move on to the next question without showing more pictures??? .
Nice! You finally got Egg Helms on Hot Ones!
That was an awesome episode! I already liked Ed Helms and I figured he was a good dude, and this just solidifies it even more for me.
Naaarddoogggg
The hottest questions!
Sean evans literally has the best autograph collection ever lmao
I know from personal experience that Da Bomb is no joke, so it’s refreshing to me to see someone take it and not get over dramatic about it - good guest! Don’t know who he is, but this was one of the better interviews
You should have Danhausen on the show, it'd be very nice and very evil
Healing collar is the word he’s looking for…#foreverdentalnerd
Nard Dog !
this is so good to watch high
Good video but please relay to Ed Helms he has got to do another Cedar Rapids movie, the original was one of my favorite movies of all time.
Shut up about the banjos! SHUT UP ABOUT THE BANJOS!!!
Men theres a good guy right there
Switch to rumble guys, YouTube is socialist evil
Yummy
Good job Ed Helms!
Okay, now we NEED Steve Carell
Dude always looks like he has pink eye.
RIT DIT DIT DI DO
I personally think Ed was like, “yeah cool you dug out some old questions, but I actually wanted to talk about my new show…..and now I just want the fuck outta here, but really good job….and ‘don’t bother’” hahhaha the southern gentleman came out lol.
Random!!!! Hey Sean I think u should try to get Nardwuar on the show, think it would be the most high viewing shows ever
The intro" It's like a car wreck!" Me: "And I'm rubber-necking!"
It's the Nard Dog!!!
We would love to see Nardwar on the hot ones.
So you have a show coming out with Jim halpert. Got it.
"Don't bother." roflmao
Not sure if anyone has commented but , Get LUIS BLACK on here !!!! That would be epic ! He's so beautifully animated 🤘 Also, would love to see Rainn Wilson!
Ok we got Andy on the show, but WHEN shall we have Michael? I'm sure he will destroy these wings like Michael Scarn annihilate Goldenface in the masterpiece "Threat Level Midnight"!
The fire is shooting at us!!!!
So cool that they were able to get Egg Helms to take some time out of his busy schedule.
Ed Helms will always be up there when it comes to underrated actors
I have a similar story with a tooth implant! I was also born without the ability to grow adult lateral incisors so when my director told me I needed to mess myself up for one scene (did a musical called “Disaster!” that has a lot of stuff break and go insane) I told her about my implants and I had to take my retainer with the tooth out for my performances! Always made me feel better knowing I wasn’t alone :) Great job Sean, thanks for having Ed on :)
Sean coming in with all that teeth work and 2" lifts.
dude sean why do u always talk so fast when u introduce explain that gram?
CAN WE PLEASE GET THE ROCK
Man, I'd love to buy the sauce line up, but to get it in Canada is over $200. Hard to justify at that point :(
It's a hot 2
I feel like they're going to have to step up the 9 and 10 sauces...it's kind of a let down after The Bomb. lol
I know this show is normally on top of these things but his name is Egg Helms I believe
He was trying to GTFO like stop asking me questions lol
The Nard Dog <3
Getting Zach Galifianakis on here would be a great episode! Hilarious persona
Hey First We Feast. His name is actually Egg Helms. Not Ed.
Idk why but I didn't expect ed to be this nice. He was such an interesting guest
I always picture guests telling Sean afterwards: “I like you Sean, your a nice guy, but I never wanna see you again”.
“I should have taken a Pepcid before this”
bill cosby can be his mouth medic
Michael franzese
The Nard dog 🐶
Andy finally made it guys 🥲
Good ol' asbestos tongue
Ed "asbestos tongue" Helms!
You know when they sort of take a step back on #4 that we're in for a good time. "Ow. Ow!"
Wow I thought he would gave gotten killed but he surprised me … well done
matpat
Another great video! Thank you! 😁👍♥
As country as it gets!!
LOVE THR BANJO!!!
First we feast should interview Nardwaur
Omg pls do zachhh g
the wings sure have improved since the early years!   hilarious interview. already collecting for this years 'guests compliment Sean' video
Where’s da bomb
Not going to lie something about this interview was so wholesome. ;")
Good to see Egg Helms again.
That was hilariously real! One of my favorite episodes.
I like Ed Helms. Cool dude
Get Morgan  Freeman on here
Lol, hot ones just figured out how to trick guests into doing ads they can sell.
I actually love this guy and everything he’s in
The Nard dog
the nard-dog!!
Dude was in actual pain. Big pain. But he pushed through. Respect!
What a brave man Ed is amazing
What is this show?  An interview show that slowly tortures their guests?
Also grilled pimento cheese is delicious. ESP if you add it to Mac with some bacon
This show is literally the only reason I would like to be famous
Sean where’d you get that jacket from, it’s pretty 🔥
"Don't Bother🤣🤣
His left ear is so perfectly straight
We're going to package up those hot sauces for you .... "Don't bother." Lol.
eMOTIONal DAMage
you done good Nard dog
lmao. Redlettermedia dragged Jeff Who Lives at Home for seeming like it was ALL shitty improv. Guess they were right on the mark
NardDog acting pretty good as this Ed Helms guy
*doesn't wanna leave his seat after wing 10* "you can't just sit here and cry" "OH I CAN SO JUST SIT HERE AND CRY"
Beastly
The Narddog! I was expecting a little "BUH-RIGUGUGU!"
SEAN WHY DONT YOU EVER EAT THE WINGS ANYMORE??? EAT THE WHOLE THING!!!! 🙄🙄🙄
I love the studio giggles as they dove into Da 💣
Can we get Trent Reznor :p
What we really need to see is James Bateman on this
So you're telling me I'm gonna die...
Great episode
So proud of him tho lmao
I just love it how all the bottles are pretty much the same height and then there is da bomb ruining everything for everyone
Would have been funny to have him do an ad read about the adverse side effects that hot sauce will have on his bowels in a couple hours.  Great episode as always!!
More athletes would be cool
OMG!! The nard dog 🐕
I feel Trevor Bauer would be a dope interview lol for real
Ed Helms is such a likable person.  I'll definitely watch the new show with Randall Park.
Can you get Zach Galifianakis on the show?
"What do tigers dream of when they take a little Tiger snooze"
Mickey my friend!!
Drew is here to eat something fun
Need a Try Guys interview
Are the flames on top of hot sauce bottles real or CGI??????
GET. JON. STEWART.
Dwight Shrute!!! But in Character 😅
To be fair Ed Helms always sounds a little drunk
Who better than ol' asbestos tongue to read and ad about the consequences of ingesting too much asbestos
Why not have Matthew Perry on Hot Ones? I’d love to see a more vulnerable side to him
"don't bother" 😂😂😂
I feel like Ed helms, Christopher mintz, and Anna Kendrick all came from the same batch...
No french toast . . . we need this.
roo doo doo doo doo
Da Bomb, the bag pipes of hot sauces
EGG HELMS!!!
Fantastic as always ! I think this show is a perfect vehicle for the expression ¨Do Not Speak With Your Mouth FULL..!!¨
true story based on hamish and andy!?
Egg Helms!
I love Ed so much lol
Shoutout Hamish and Andy for the OG "True Stories" show!
I can't wait for the day when a guest will bring up the Nomex tongue that Lourde has.  One of these episodes...
This show is both wonderful because I love the interviewer and questions, and horrible because i feel like im a terrible human being enjoying the moments when others are in the most pain
Is nobody gonna talk about the absolute pain that happens 24 hours later?  You know Sean is getting texts later on like 'you SoB'
His face melted🤣
Sean you are an amazing interviewer and in my opinion you have the coolest job ever.  My top 3 I'd love to see are Tech N9ne, Woody Harrelson, and Nick Swardson!
“In college they called me asbestus tongue, i could eat everything. They called me ace, i had straight A’s”
The Nard Dog!
Ed can take the heat.
Don't bother lmao
Hot Ones:  "We're going to box those sauces up for you" Ed:  "Don't bother" Me:  ded
The music was Top notch
Anybody figure out which interview/guest spot he had to do that followed this one?
I knew it was going to be a good one when he started feeling the heat at wing #2.
Dayum, Ed did more than most guests. He actually bites off the skin
The show was great! Thank you!
Should give him a Cornell sauce
Crazy to see Drew Bernard control his anger
Yummy
Love to see Nardawg!
How and why is first we feast only on 11M it should be more than 11m
mesothelioma lmao
Daaaaamn ed helms is aging worse than I am
zaddy
You just got nard dawggedd!!
dang I would love to see a Korean version of this channel, would love to see someone like Lee Jung Jae as a guest
First we feast should do a charity auction where you get to be on Hot Ones and Sean does a full interview with you.  If I won, Sean would somehow know about my like childhood best friend when I was 6 even tho there's no online record of that.
"Don't bother" at the End lmaoooo
Parkour !
I never get tired of seeing the reaction to Da Bomb ... f'n HILARIOUS every time
Get Nardwuar on this show!
NARD DOG FOR THE WIN!!! LOLLL
love Hot Ones 🔥 but I'm starting the petition now to see an episode of Hot Ones with big ole Sean Evans & Joe Rogan!!!!
"My brother used to call me asbestos tongue"  "I got all B's"
I like how they light the bottles on fire now. Thats a nice touch
Nice to see Egg’s doing well for himself
Ri Di Dit Da Dooooo! Well done Andrew Bernard!
I want John Krasinski and Emily Blunt on this show so bad.
“These wings are going to make me lose MY FREAKING MIND!” *punches hole in table* “That was an overreaction.”
7:44 the little banjo tribute and the "That's enough about Bluegrass, Helms!" melted my Bluegrass heart. Pickers have one more reason to love Ed ...
21:15 "This is super fun... and cool... and harmful..." 😂 Best description of the show ^^
The Earth is Flat! The Globe is a satanic lie that is the basis for climate change, evolution, the big bang, old earth, and atheism. Space is a lie, the world is exactly as the Bible described!
Can't get enough of the plug starting by "I'm in pain" or "thanks this was fun" before the guest remember that they went through this to promote something.
His name is actually egg helms
Such a good dude. Love Ed! Great episode guys!
You need to a vegan version just so you can interview Joaquin Phoenix.
That’s why Sean gets big names.( and if you notice they always have a smile on their face first thing). Between the questions and the way the interview is set up, it’s like a breath of fresh air from all the same questions they get and almost gets them out of the “robot” stage. I bet they look back and smile like, “ yeah, well I ate a 2mill degree chicken wing” lol
He got old
Sean missed the opportunity to say "Like the banjo?" when Ed said there was nothing redeeming about Da Bomb.
Isn't that Egg Helms?
Don't bother..🤣
His name is Egg Helms.  Not Ed.
RADADIDOOOOOO
I think he pushed it and walked off set after while they were talking to get to a medic or ambulance.
"I wish there was a way to know you were in the good old days before you actually left them."
Why are yall sitting so far apart?...looks weird
Class act from helms
Ed Helms, great job. Thanks for not being DJ Khaled
Please, PLEASE! Bring in Matthew Patrick (film theory / game theory / food theory) <- He really wants it! and Matthew Mercer (critical role) <- can be an amazing interview!
Snotting and crying and dribbling and still trying to answer the question! Brilliant interview 😂😃. Loved it!!!
Ed you didn't go to Cornell?
Yes! The Nard Dog!! 🐶
Good job Ed. Mad Respect!
17:40 where the camera does the close up and you see snot and tears coming from his face 😂
Yummy
Who here has actually done Hot Ones Home Grown?
You need to get the spice king on here
I didn’t feel like eating wings to watch first we feast today but i ate some sushi called the bomb roll with wasabi 💣
Pamentto cheese or bought in little tubs and southerners put it on crashers and white bread.
🎶🎶🎶“What does Ed Helm dream of, when he’s eating really hot wings dude? Does he dream of melting his tongue off, or having really really fucking hot poo.” 🎶🎶🎶
PLEASE GET ANNE HATHAWAY
Give this man a blaster cause he is a fucking trooper!
we love ed helms
Nard Dog 🐕
Wait did they get those wings from Gordon Like he said they would 🧐
I ♥️ to see Dwayne on the show
I love that we’ve reached a point where every participant low key HAS TO muscle through the hurt so they don’t end up lookin like little bitches like to Khaled and Ricky Gervais.
Steve Martin is one of the best banjo players in the world! Pretty incredible to see.
I LOVE THIS SHOW 😂😂😂 been watching for years and its so damn good to see these people just start to slowly fall apart while Sean is firing away w his questions. So genius. I could never bc I would die LOL
Me seeing flames on the sauce bottle 😳 SAUCE: Yh, we got to make it hotter 😁
Big tuna
JUST 2 DAYS AGO I FINALLY SAW THE HANGOVER 3 AND YOU GIVE ME THIS? AWESOME
This is not Ed, this is BABY WAWA OH I CAN SO JUST SIT HERE AND CRY 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
so they just ripped off drunk history?
Isn’t it “Egg” Helms?
Is it the alcohol or Sean’s question are getting longer and longer ..?
I have never seen Sean show how Da Bomb affect him that much, lol. He IS Human after all!
He comes across as a genuinely nice guy, someone who is enjoyable to be around. He did great!!
Wow! One of my favourite comedians along with Will Ferrell and some others - thanks Hot ones! Was true fun!
I thought his name was Egg Henry?
To confirm, the last dab wing already has the sauce on it, and they dab more one it? It is hard to gauge how much sauce is on all the wings.
Soooo hilarious I fking love him
Andy ♥️
Yeah!! I love you so much more because you love boiled peanuts. Best parts of the South right there.
The secret is to edit a 3 hour interview into 45 seconds. It can be funny but also the most obnoxious and overused technique popularized by the daily show. Love Jon Stewart but what he inspired is awful.
The metaphors are getting a little bit too much in this one.kinda took the fun out of the video... Too many ambiguous references and not much fun. Weird interview for sure, not the best one. Maybe I had big expectations
First time I’ve seen Sean kinda fucked up. The bomb does not discriminate
“I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.” - Drew
Missed opportunity with the disclaimer, should have done one for spice lords, that would have been a great addition to your production. Keep up the good work, amazing interview!
Brilliant Da Bomb reaction,  and nice to see you sweat a tad too Sean!  Great interview,  well helped ( as duly noted by the guest) by the usual thorough research and well versed host.
I love how impressed and physically hurt everyone who comes to the show eventually feels.
I was watching The Office like 5 minutes ago, open youtube like another day, and you upload this! lol
They should have the whole Office casts do it together
He said don’t bother lol send them to me pleas lol
Im not sure if this has ever been asked before BUT ... obviously these videos are edited, which is completely understandable.  Im WAY curious to know how much time is edited out between the last few wings. Like from wing 8 to 9, on video, we only see about 90 seconds. How much is left on the editing floor? :)  Also, AWESOME interview. Big fan of Helms for a long long time. He comes across as such a good dude. Sean is, as always, his usual charming self.
I want to see the interview he did after this
You didn't talk about Rutherford Falls!
Don't Bother 😂
EMILY BLUNT AND JOHN KRASINSKIIIIII PLEASE
Now sure why the voice clip of Ed Helm refusing the opened sauces to take home, but it just makes Ed look like a wasteful Hollywood prick, which I'm sure he's not and someone can cite evidence.,
These were not the diluted versions, glad to see the authentic show is back, I was losing interest with the diluted sauces.
For the celebrities on here that say they have interviews to do after hot ones, I’m always curious as to how those go for them
LMAOOOOO the ending had me dead
Awesome job Ed! Professional, polite, appreciative and funny in the face of a challenge.
Finally!!, the full sauce lineup in one box!! Brilliant idea
Banger
Damn he sounded just like the commercials 😂😂😂
DaBomb causes mesothelioma!
If you haven't seen him in Cedar Rapids you're missing out.
First nerds
boring so far. Get rid of the candles. It's hot sauce. not wax.
I have a hot question for you Sean: Which guest did you have to edit/cut the most out of the finished video, either by request from the management of said guest, or by your own volition?
Can’t believe Hot Ones got the great Egg Helms
Stop saying yummy
Oberlin? I'm pretty sure he went to Cornell. Ever heard of it?
hey sean ur show kinda getting dull and boring lemme  spit ball here instead celebs do youtubers  more and more zoomber u know  try to be less boomer
I hate "ageing"...
most i’ve seen Sean affected by the wings in a while! love this episode for a lot of reasons
This show wouldn't be halve as fun, if it wasn't for the great questions that get interesting stories, and amazement out of the guests, almost every time ;D Keep up the good work!
Julia Garner would be a great guest!!!
Oh shit, Sean was feeling it near 17 mins.
THIS SINGLE-HANDEDLY MADE MY ENTIRE DAY
Thought we'd see a Jackass crew wing thing this week with the release of Jackass: Forever, but never am I disappointed with new content from you guys. I think Ed wanted to just get the hell out of there after that tho!
Awesome. Hilarious
Honestly a great ambassador to idiosyncratic interests. "This thing is weird, it's not for everyone, but I love it"
The Nard-Dog. A legend !
Haven't seen it..but this is gonna be good lol
Man McLovin got old
There's something ironic about Ed reading an ad warning of thew dangers of asbestos while his mouth is on fire
The amplified coughs always get me 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Ed one of my favorite actors and comedians.great work man,keep it coming
I would just reference his performance of country roads with rainn in that office scene as all the justification in the world for playing the banjo
STEW‼️‼️ Great interview. He is naturally hilarious😂
16:20 Awww you gonna cry, baby wawa?
Sean is always hoping someone can tell him what's going on.
LOL! "Don't bother"
Was anyone else hoping he would be like "my brother called me asbestos tongue, I ate the hottest stuff they called me dragon breath, then I cried when I pooped, they called me pepper pansy... ok, beer me that wing" ::eats wing:: "nailed it"  -13 minutes later he eats Da Bomb- "I am cutting Sean's head off with a chainsaw... reeenehnehnehneh"
Man Andy Bernard looking really old!
dude just plays himself in The Hangover ahahah
That was such a smooth interview. Love Ed ❤️
Please invite Mark Weins
What a nice, quiet and awesome guy. He's a great comedian as he looks like the total opposite. And Sean as usual delivers the goods and makes great questions.
He is so calming and seems like a nice guy 💜
"There's nothing redeeming about that" - ah, Da Bomb
Da Bomb always gets em, it's just a rude and obnoxious sauce 😆
You should get Nardwuar on
The tooth story 🤣
Rainnnnn 🌧
Ed is what I want in a naturally funny yet smartly played out segment.
95 out of 100 people on the Los Calientes - this is sooooooooo  nice. . . . . . . ... . .. me watching the reaction here - - - - - well ... this is gonna be good :D : D
There’s nothing redeeming about that 😂
Its egg helms guys, not ed. Show some god damn respect.
The Hangover is almost 13 years old.  Time flies
NOT THE MESOTHELIOMA AD💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
“My nose is sprinting.” 🤣
I am huge  fan of Office, good interview!
There’s no way he said “shut up about the banjo” and Sean didn’t immediately reply “shut up about the sun! Shut up about the sun!”
What the hell is a mouth medic?
Sean looks so happy this episode lol not that he isn’t always but you can see it in his happy lil eyes
Curious Sean  Why didn't you include his show Rutherford Falls on Peacock  ?
Da bomb is battery acid, its not good but its worth a try just to understand why its sooo bad😂😂pure extract heat
He looks like Greg Gutfeld
I really didn't like The office, it was good to see him in pain. Steve Carroll next but can you ramp up the spice a little more?
He’s a cool actor but we need better guest man. Get Wallen on here or durk
Oh shit it's Egg Helms
Da Bomb is by far the most disgusting taste I have ever experienced.  The heat is far too painful, to also taste like the bottom of Shrek's foot.
If we get more The Office US cast on the show this yould be so cool.
Ed was awesome. That's how it's done 👏😊👏
Man imagine a hot ones with tobey, andrew and tom holland, or just tobey or andrew, the dream
Ahhhhhhhhh
Just imagine Sean Evans and Nardwuar in the same room together interviewing each other ... #Golden
I always knew him as "that guy from that movie remember?"    now I know his name thank you
The "Asbestos Tongue" story totally sounded like an Andy Bernard story, so I have to believe it lmfao
great guest.
I can't think of anything more delicious and nostalgic than boiled peanuts and a pimento cheese sandwich.
I always feel so proud when the celebrities are impressed by Sean's questions and appreciate how much thought and research the Hot Ones team have put into the interviews. It's always great to watch 👍🏽👍🏽
"Don't bother" 🤣🤣🤣
Loved Ed Helms in The Hangover & Vacation. Also the comedic villain in We’re The Millers
21:00  *wholesome music starts playing*  Ed: This was super fun and cool and.. harmful. :|
Sean does more research than nardwar haha
hot ones chicken wings sold in your frozen food isle?
Edd helms is such a underrated actor
'dont bother'  AHHHHH baahahaa!!   How many others have turned down the set, I wonder?
Where was the deep dive on a guest's instagram?
Big Wings!
The separation in sauces and people not shaking the bottles (thank you Ed!) before they put it on, has always baffled me. Yeah it's like water because you didn't shake the bottle. *shrug*
I would LOVE to see Chris Evans on here eventually.  I feel like he would be a shoe in for one really fun and interesting interview.
Asbestos tongue came through in the end!!
I wanna see the next interview he went to. Wish I had his press schedule, so I could look up what press came directly after Hot Ones. 😅
Entirely different kind of "celebrity" - but I'd love a First We Feast x Try Guys crossover!
Anyone running for President or public office should have to eat these wings while at the podium 😈🤣🤣
Wonder what Ed had to do after this interview. Even all the celebs on their press tours, what interview did they do after Hot Ones because I wanna see how they're handling the aftermath XD
Ohhh baby the NARD DOG is in the house
awesome ep, Look into the scissor bros they would be great on here
I wanna see the whole office crew! Shut up about the sun!!!
I have to say I love this show because i am not watching celebrities, I am watching people that are   celebrities. Very cool
I just got "gifted" a Banjo. It's humbling to learn.
"Don't bother..." Best line of the show.
NARD DOG!!!!! 🐶 🐶 🐶
David koechner, Kathy bates, Jessica alba. You already got Jack black but his would be good again,  Rob riggle would be good,  Andy Buckley, Ricky Gervais, Leslie David baker, Paul lieberstein, creed Bratton lol,  and steve Carell
My guy‼️😀
Great Job by Egg Helms!
it's Ed Helms? i been saying "Egg"....weird
Get Craig Ferguson!!!
He's gonna need some chok
oh my god he looks like hes getting older that makes me so sad :( i love him so much.
Have Red Hot Chili Peppers on
1) You should contact Pepperidge Farm and have them make a classic, los calientes and last dab apollo flavored goldfish crackers! 2) Los calientes should come in much larger quantities! It's totally my favorite taco/burrito/pizza sauce! 3) Can we get Ed Helms to do some reading for books on tape? Please?
Fantastic interview.
Michael or Dwight
Identity theft is not a joke Ed, that is Jim.
Nice! Now we need Randall!
Without a doubt, more gangster then DJ Khalid, and my guy doesn’t try to be lol
I think some of the things that happened when I worked in steel mills and factories would be so perfect for his new show! Ed reminds me a little of Fred Gwyenn of the Munsters, but much more handsome.
22:43 😂 “did I just endorse something?”
It's Egg Helms !
Andy gets to work with big tuna? Awesome!!
I literally saw the commercial roll by in my brain as Ed read those lines.
Forever Nard Dog
Ed Helms is such a great guy.
Plz have John Krasinski on the show🙏🙏🙏🙏
ed Helms is the worst.  thumbs emphatically down.
Ed Helms looks like a member of Jackass who retired and became a dad
What a lovely person
How have I never heard "my nose is sprinting" before? I'm immediately adding that to my idiom repertoire
I disagree, the banjo is awesome. Ed is in good company with Steve Martin and the late, great George Segal.
His name is EGG helms not ed
0% surprised Ed Helms was going to come off as wholesome.
Get some metal musicians on the show! Devin Townsend would be insane
I loves this interview
ANDY !!!
egg helmes
Dont bother 😂
Even Sean was on a serious strugglebus for da bomb 😂😂😂
Get CIllian murphy!!
OMG
One of the best episodes yet.  Well done, Sean and team.  Congrats Ed.
I don't feel like they connected like with most guests.
Did anyone else know he was screwed after calling himself "Asbestos tongue"?
He was as angry he did this as he was happy.
You SHOULD invite Bear Grylls, I want him to describe every single flavor in this show and watch how his face change from bad to worst like when he ate some insects in the jungle
Please get Josh from Mythical kitchen 🎉
They should open a hot ones restaurant that sells the hot ones line up of wings or just certain flavors of their wings. I feel like people would flock to a place like that were u could get to know someone or even just try out the hot ones with ur buddies and stuff
🤣🤣🤣 Love it!!!!!
They should do one with completely new sauces and interviewing Sean Evans.
Ed Helms looks like the type of guy to say "Ow" when he eats spicy food.
Great job! Ed crushed it!!! Sean you and your team always do a great job!!
Episode 23456342 of waiting for MatPat
Did I hear voiceover, come on let's get some Titans together. Ed Helms on Critical role and Matthew Mercer on Hot Ones!!!!
We need to see Keanu Reeves and Steve Carell on this show
My day sucked at work until I saw this thumbnail NOW IM F….. Happy !!!!
What a great episode. Thanks.
Sean has such a great speech it's amazing
Props to Ed. He's not a nibbler like some other guests.
The best office I know is Critical Role. Can you guys start trying to get Matthew Mercer on?
Its Egg Helms! :D
I miss his face tattoo..
The Nard dog finally becoming a star in Hot Ones 🙏🏼<3
Ed: “where is my FREAKING glass of milk.”
Music was way too loud around Da Bomb.
Would love to see Sarah McDaniel.
were gonna pack those up for you in a box for you.... lmfao dont bother.
I love his movies, but I’ve never knew his name.
I love how everyone that comes on is impressed by the research done and questions asked. These are the only celebrity interviews I watch because of that. The humans melting is just a bonus.
I didnt know Andy and Jim will reunite for a new show, good to know.
Love Ed! He was so good in Together Together!!
Did he wiped the sauce off w the napkin before he ate the last wing?
Could you get Nardwuar on here?!?! Great episode!!
Dr. Disrespect. When's it happening?
Ed Helms is literally one of the nicest guys ever
This interview was really disrespectful Sean, his name is EGG!!!!!
If you don't have milk in your nose, you're fine. Next comes the Hot Ones Hangover 🔥
You might want to fix a typo in the title. It said "Ed" Helms. His name is Egg Helms.
for some reason i just REALLY wanna see jesse eisenberg on this show
This is doing permanent damage Sean smiles and laughs knowingly.
Ohh shit it's Mcluvin
I got a very satisfying belly laugh at 24:24 when the crew offered to box up the sauces and Ed was like "nah, I'm good" 😂
That story about his tooth reminded me of how they made Jim Carrey’s front tooth looked chipped in Dumb & Dumber - it really IS chipped, due to a classmate pushing him into a desk in middle school. Jim just always had a cap over it, but removed it for Dumb & Dumber to make Lloyd look even goofier.
Hangover 4 confirmed?
water to drink not milk?are you sure that you know what are you doing lol
Oh ohhh, I bought Los Calientes but haven’t used it yet. I’ll be very careful with it.
First time in a while I've seen Sean be affected by the heat... is he losing his touch!?
these the wings he ate in cornell
Don’t bother.
nunca me imagine que Ed fuera TAN ABURRIDO!
https://youtu.be/zIJErVlVOY8
the sound guy on this one....SMOOTH FKN FIRE BRO
Boiled peanuts are amazing.
Poor Egg, nobody ever gets his name right.
Ed Helms wants to drink from the firehose? Stanley can make that happen!
Aw, it's so nice that Jim and Andy are still friends and are making podcasts together!
I would love to order those sauces but $120usd before  tax  and shipping  is rough for your Canadian fans. I did pony up for the Sean sculpture but I have limits. :(
THE BANJOOOO !!!!!!!
This made me like Ed Helms 1000X more and I already loved him
I wonder which season of The Office was the one where he was wearing a tooth flipper.. 🤔
Please have Jeremy Strong on! Or any cast members from Succession... I need to see that!! haha
What a freaking champ.
why the Explain that Gram section super short?? hmmmmmm.....
Love Ed! Such a genuine guy
Dom’s new title should be mouth medic
Ed Helms cut in line in front of me at a comedy venue in LA years ago. It was awesome.
This was great! As always my favorite thing about Hot Ones (other than watching people suffer from food LOL) is the deep cut type questions.
mentioning the daily show, you guys need to get jon stewart!
Was really hoping for an Aunty Donna shoutout, still a great interview
Daily Show churned out so many great entertainers.
Ahhhh!
Ed Helms looks like black pepper is a spice to him.
Honestly, the guest we didn't know we wanted.
Guys there's a typo in the title - his name is Egg
This is one of the most pleasant interviews I’ve ever seen
Ed really pulled through, props to him. Great interview, great episode! Keep em' coming Sean!
The way Sean says Heatonist really sounds like Heatness.
Fuck Turbotax.
I wanna watch the interview he had after this one :D
What would it be like to have a fan only season? You could have a sweepstakes for who makes it onto the show with a set of 20 or so interview questions and pick the best answers, and fly the people out to face the gauntlet! I think that would be incredible to watch regular people deal with the crazy heat of the wings.
READIDDUDUDU
This is one of the great ones. I'm dying.
Get Tobey Maguire
First one here  from Michigan
Yall should start providing the link to the guest next interview so we can see how they handle it ...🤣🤣🤣
Micheal Rosenbaum
Love this guy! Mf cool as hell
Som vanligt en fantastiskt bra intervju med ännu en sympatisk deltagare! Chili make you humble! :-) Hälsningar från Sverige!
Nard Dog and Big Tuna reunited 😌
''THE FIRE IS SHOOTING AT US''
Loved it!
Ed Helms is a super-fun kind dude. love him. reminds me of Paul Rudd.
Jeff who lives at home is actually a really cute movie. would recommend if anyone hasnt seen.
Dropped a like for that stern professional intro
Love me some Egg Helms.
ed was a great sport. I applaud the extra bites.
Can you use "Steve O's Hotsauce for your butthole" ? Lol
Ah ah ah ah staying alive staying alive….
I loved Andy but he was one of the worst characters on the show for me He just changed so many times, was a shitty guy, became a better guy and was trying and then became a shitty guy again before getting humbled in the end  Idk, just wanted more for Andy I guess
Spicy Tuna!
First Class!
Gotta get Creed Bratton on next!
I wish he asked about Rutherford Falls. More people need to watch it. It's on Peacock and has great Native representation. Ed Helms is also in it, of course.
Remind me again why Heatonist replaces Da Bomb Insanity with Da Bomb Evolution? I was kind of disappointed when I received my season 17 set, and the most nefarious sauce wasn't there. I should have paid attention to the pictures and descriptions more I guess.
Holy voiceover what a performance
Really like the way he took it onboard an settled into it, shame it was so short cool guy tho 😎
Producer - "...and we're gonna package up those sauces for you to take home." Ed - "don't bother." 😂
I want to hear a story about one of the celebrities rolling out of this gauntlet and right into some fancy interview with no warning to that host. Maybe these days they'd think covid and it wouldn't be as funny as it is in my head right now, but I feel like it'd be a riot.
8:42 "Shut up about the banjo! SHUT UP ABOUT THE BANJO!"
110,000 views already? That's prodigious!
Excellent job Nard Dog!
I thought he WAS a doctor…
Andy and the Big Spicy Tuna
Ed helms I was alwayings wondering who had that name !!
Missed opportunity, should’ve been  “Ed Helms Punches a Hole In The Wall While Eating Spicy Wings”
"we're gonna packaged up those boxes for you to take home"  Ed: "don't bother"  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Ed's such a nice guy :)
The “Don’t Bother!” At 24:20 was so deeply sincere I barked out loud… I skipped laughing out loud and jump barked a single laugh that woke up the dog.
It's nice when you can tell an actor is a genuinely good person that enjoys bringing happiness and entertainment to others.
I agree with Ed's acapella assessement on to of that, no matter how well you sing, singing words to someone, even when it is not a notable song is creepy. Got to love that, especially when they are overly sincere.
Great episode. However, watching Ed made me wonder. Is there ANY chance that hillary is slipping some hot sauce into the president's coffee to make him look bad and get back into politics?
The nard dog
I was actually a bit worried for Ed for a few seconds there !
Bruh FWF hot ones don't miss hilariously cold blooded respect its entertainment gangsta no cap lol stay safe RIP Bob Saget Betty White Sidney Poitier Cheslie Kryst Louie Anderson BLM God bless stop all dis hate checkout The Main Squeeze 🙏
Ed should get together with Steve Martin who also plays banjo for a jam session .
I fucking love the office and andy is one of my favorite characters from the show. So excited for this episode.
Dont bother haha!!
Matpat would be great on this show.
This show is a little gimmicky with having guests eat spicy wings and hoping for funny reactions but what gets lost is how good of an interviewer sean evans is and how much research he does on his guest
I can't believe Sean didn't ask Ed if he went to Cornell...
A billion scovilles, c'mon guys.
👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼
I loved tihs one
Why have I heard so often that Ed Helms is a jerk in real life?
Amazing......much love
Asbestos Tongue does voice over for a drug that deals with asbestos poisoning.
Jim!!!!
Wow... real fans will know that his name is actually EGG Helms...
*Egg Helms
I didn't know his brothers called him asbestos tongue, I always thought since he used to get wicked hammered, they called him Puke. He would have gotten expelled if he let it affect his grades but he aced all his tests so they called him Ace. He got straight B's. They called him buzz.
This is already a future classic
Da Bomb hit Sean hard this time... Yet he still remains perfectly on track. Legend
More Aunty Donna, please, Egg!
Working on Henry Cavill i hope!
Sean! Next season get Gator Hammock sauces in the lineup, they're delicious!
Noticeably felling bombed the last 8 minutes, fun to watch, many good times.
Without a doubt.......you need to do an aftermath show
Sean keeps calling him the wrong name. It's Egg Helms
Wow, time has not been kind to McLovin
Gotta respect the fact that he didn’t ask one single hangover question
🤣🤣🤣 He was feeling it 🔥 🔥 🔥
Good episode, cool dude
That wonky table managed to distract me every time.
Egg Helms*  If you know you know.
Crew: "We're gonna package up those sauces for you to take home"  Ed: "Don't Bother"   lol loved that last line!
Omg it's Egg Helms!
Blue Grass Helms would be a great stage name
I am like a proud mom when they compliment Sean's question skills and his research
Anyone else see that Bonnaroo wristband👏🏼 @7:50
Without Da Bomb, I think most people will survive fine with the hot wings. The moment of truth is when they about to have Da Bomb and thats like the only time most celebrity start changing their tune. I an so glad Da Bomb is the only sauce that survived from the very first episode untl now. I hope they will never get rid of Da Bomb
you should get Rachel Brosnahan , she is in NYC . also get Aubrey Plaza back .
RRRRREdididooooo
Your dad isn’t alone we all love boiled peanuts
I think that Seann William Scott would be great one. What you think
Ed? his name is Egg....Egg Helms?!
lmao the final "don't bother"
19:07 that’s what she said
Not one Aunty Donna mention…. Disappointed
Love the show! Not a huge fan of the candle flames over the hot sauces. Loved this interview in particular :)
I think it's safe to say that the Da Bomb is the final boss in disguise
Jesus I can only see “Andy” whenever he talks lmao
Jeff who lives at home is really good movie
Ed Helms need's a fat Dude with an Asian Baby and a Couple Roofyyyys😂☝
I don't know if it's just me but I want becky g on here.
i loved this one! Ed Helms is the best, also Sean Evans teeth still looks soo fucking weird wtf XD
Speaking of Acapella…I would love to see Pentatonix / @ptxofficial in this show.
"Umm, that's number two?" - ol' Asbestos Tongue
The Nard Dog!
You can do it Andy!
I just love Sean 🥰🥰🥰
Egg Helms??
I don't even care that much about the hot sauce, i just love the interviews. Incredible questions
He is one  the cutest person in the world .i love his movies
I'm glad he had fun making "Jeff Who Lives At Home" or whatever it's called, but holy shit was that a crappy movie lol
WOW ! Go Nard Dog !
The Nard Dog lives on
Looks like Ol' Asbestos Mouth did As-best-os he could lol
Hey, we got a box for you to take home ...    "Don't Bother" .. hahahaha
Dude the da bomb sauce has literally stood the test of time
What a humble man! Love this
I want to see the interview he went to after this pne Lol
you can tell what guests follows the show by how they approach Da Bomb hot sauce.. me having seen all the seasons know whats gonna happens once your tongue touch the Da bomb...lol
Class act!
Asebesdos tongue? I thought this was boner champ…I might be thinking of broccoli rob tho
Love u Ed, ur my dads doppelgänger
Woodysgamertag fell off harder than Fetty Wap
I love ed
Coming soon :( I got baited :(
Every one of these interviews that you do, I can't help but remember, Jackass crossed with Charlie Rose. Bravo Sean & Team.
The man the myth the legend, Andy Bernard!!!!!
Drew , he's drew now
How do y'all get those bottles to burn for the insert shots?! I love it!
So the ad read about asbestos exposure and Ed's brother calling him "asbestos tongue" was just a coincidence, right? Or are Sean and the Hot Ones crew really that good?
Andy finally completed his dream of becoming a famous celebrity. I'm so happy for him!!!
20:00 really sad that you missed the opportunity to ask him about the acapella group he founded at Cornell.
Why is he soo nice... How does he exist in today's world 😂😂😂
YES PLZ DO MORE THE OFFICE GUYS <3
John Krasinski next pls!!!
not the mesothelioma ad read😂😂
We would love to see CANELO on hot ones. Am just curious if Canelo would make it to the end
The asbestos tounge ref was so much of an Andy Bernard statement its hilarious
I've watched this show for years and I think this is the first episode I've seen where Sean reacts to the spiciness of a wing.
You should get Bill Murray!!
Interesting that they're showing Sean's reactions to Da Bomb in this one.  Is this an attempt to make Sean look more human and less teflon? Or did the person making the wings just feel extra sadistic that day?
Man, Ed seems like such a down to earth guy, I love it
Glad I’m not Ed Helms right now, I have no spice tolerance what so ever, so I be dead lol
Anyone else bothered by the hot sauce going from right to left?
THE NARD DOG
Get bill burr in hot Ones asap!
Great interview!!
Wow.. this guy is so much different than what I thought he was like. I have a new level of respect for him now.
Production Assistant: We're gonna package up those sauces for you to take home. Ed: Don't bother. LMFAOOOO
I like Ed Helms ... in *that way ;)
He's on par with Will Ferrell, very entertaining 👍
Image how insane an interview with Nardwuar would be.
payday candybar
Finally, The Nard Dog
Ed Helms is like that one uncle that will chat with you about life and while simulatiously prevent this socially awkward brother from initiating conversation
Helms repping those Thorogood boots.
🔥🔥🔥THE NARD DOG 357 🔥🔥🔥
I hope you will land John Krasinski
Need to have Rainn Wilson and Krasinsky
I was gona watch this bur saw ed helms was the guest...and remembered hall pass, hangover etc
This felt like old hot ones thank you
Overall Vibe:  _forcedlaughterawkwardaf_ 😬🥴😮‍💨 Turns out some on-screen comedians are painfully _unfunny_ off-screen. ☠️  Props to #seanevans and that right eyebrow for making it through. #realones 💯
he honestly took those wings like a champ. da bomb is the only one that got him (usually the one that sets it off)
You have this tough guys wannabes like Quavo oe DJ Khaled and they cannot eat even half of the wings and you have humble guts like Ed, or Mike Cera who clear the board
i think it'd be funny if they had a completely non-famous random person as a guest but sean still gave a super in depth interview with tons of background information
Hey it's Egg Helms
Is it just me or was the music a little distracting in this one?
Each episode is a reminder of how well this format works. The way guests are always caught off guard by Da Bomb & Sean’s perfectly crafted questions is just… *chefs kiss*
*egg
Sauce on fire!  I love the intro with the sauces on fire.  You just know it's going to be hot!  Be prepared to burn on the Hot Ones set.
Who else snowed in?
A really good interview!! One of the best
Mickey my friend!
“We’re going to pack up these sauces for you to take home” ….. ED - “don’t bother” 😂😂😂
I believe its actually "Egg Helms"
We need Randal park or rain Willson now
Why does it feel so good when the guest are in pain from the heat :D
How long do they tape, vs what we watch
If you or a loved one may have been exposured to asbestos tongue...
Well, Oberlin wasn't a bad school to go to if you had any artistic talent whatsoever. I'm sure they have an outstanding acapella ensemble there. haha ... lucky for us Ed only got to talk about his show for 10 secs or lucky for it's over, or lucky for us what?
I LOVE LOVE LOVE the way he delivers asking questions. His voice! His wording! His hand gestures! Everything! Great interview Side note:I love how the hot sauce lids are burning like a candle 🥰🥰
Needed a mouth medic long before this show
The episode I never knew I needed
Ayy it’s soo nice to see Ed!
love you Ed! still rock Stu's Song ! I feel like this man doesn't get enough talk... Absolute legend  🤙
Ed's a trooper lol
He should have done this episode with the Face Tat...   Get Eminem next
Baby waa waa is getting really famous he is even on hot ones wow!
I would love if this show had like a video call with the guest's the next day, asking how they felt the next few hours after the show, how they felt the next day, and their impressions of the show they had before and after leaving the studio. And it would be a one or two-minute clip at the end of the interview. I feel like this would take the show to the next level because I believe a lot of people feel curious about these sorts of after-effects of this show.
Great show!
Now get John Krasinski!
Sean: how are you around spicy food ? Stu: idk hold my tooth
Woah, kinda neat you managed to land James Comey for an interview.
Please get Nathan Fielder on a episode
Wow Ed did GREAT!!! Way to go Ed!!!
Da bomb gets em Everytime.
16:08 I swear....that knowing giggle from Sean 😂
Nothing funnier when guests have no idea what Da Bomb is...you know right away when they comment on the "radioactive" symbol.
0:33 why would you say it’s an original series? Its a direct copy (licensed) version of an Australia show.
I'd love to see some of the "Gamers" on here, like TimTheTatMan or Ninja.
❤❤
I love that his nickname was Asbestos Mouth and he did an ad read about asbestos and mesothelioma in the end
that movie holidays is best comedy ever :D
I’m constantly amazed at how many people go into this without their PR team preparing them.  Have the person taste Da Bomb before they agree to do the show.
YOU’RE A DENTIST!  NOT A DOCTOR!
More The Office cast members
blahhh blahhhh joe rogan? please invite joe rogan! or maybe bing hot one's to joe rogan?
Da'Boom is so bad tasting that guess would rather eat the wing that's twice as hot to get the taste out there mouth lol.
Sean evans will absolutely be remembered as one of the greatest interviewers of all time
Crew: And we are gonna package up these sauces for you.  Ed: Don’t bother.   😂💀😂💀
Ed being genuinely grateful for the research was awesome!
By far one of the funniest episodes 😂
"Don't bother" 😂 Another great interview
I am so happy to see Egg Helms doing well.
Great to see Ed Helms! Now, anybody know what interview he did same day after this? I want to see that too. :)
Uh, no... that's a piece of chicken, Ed.
When I saw the thumbnail I was like "who is this person"? And why is hot one picking from the bottom of the barrel?
"Peice of cake" ME: Ya u wait mf I will watch you suffer   🔥 😈 🔥  This was when I knew it would be a good episode
"and we're gonna package up those sauces for you to take home." "Don't bother."  My favourite post-interview comment yet 😂 Fantastic interview as always. Love seeing guests come in not knowing much and come out going "wow, that was an awesome interview and great time."
we love a guest that appreciates the background research and thoughtfulness of the questions
I am HELLA impressed with Ed Helms. For a dude that looks like he doesn't go any spicier than mayo, he totally HANDLED it!
Ok but I need to see Robert Downey jr please 🥺
Makes me miss the Daily Show from those days. 😒
Ri-Dit-Dit-Di-Diu
MESOTHELIOMA 🤣🤣🤣 oh man, I remember that ad so hard. That killed me
FIRST!
The manning brothers!!!!
Next Rainn Wilson plzzz
Took those wings like a champ!!!!
Why did those specific wings look so good
Still hoping one day they interview a competitive eater preferably Joey Chestnut and give him 10~ wings to seans 1 wing and go from there.
Good to see the Nard Dawg killing it on HO
What’s up with the super hero music, the subtle sounds y’all used to have was so much better
I wanna be friends with Ed.
Nard Dog
To Everyone who sees this comment: Keep pushing in life and just never give up! You are a wonderful person, you can achieve everything you want, God may bless you.🥰🥰🥰
My boy Sean wants to retire already. He's over this show lol, you can tell he's digging deeper to get excited recently
This dude seems pretty chill. Hope he doesn’t flip out and punch a wall over these wings
"Dinner date with wings of death" poetry
The pinnacle of celebrity notoriety is being well known enough to be interviewed on hot ones
When was the last time someone went on the wall of shame? Has anyone on the wall ever asked to come back to redeem themselves?
MICKEY MY FRIEND
Watching Hot Ones while eating some hot wings  Great episode
hey it's good to see Andy and Nate bonding over wings ❤️
When he says he was in an a capella group in college and he’s about to say the name, I half expected him to say “Here Comes Treble”
Oberlin Alum here!! Ed Helms is such a great ambassador for us 😅
Riiii di di di doooo!
I think you guys should get Jim Carrey on here
Mans has gotten old
Harry styles plsssss
Skip to 16:03 for da bomb
@24:21 Ed Helms forgets that the point in bringing them home isnt for him to enjoy on himself. Its to bust out on the arrogant friends who will say they could have handled it. You drop down a few of those and chalelnge them on the spot.
would love to see the rock on this
I am amazed for the choice of words Sean has. Wow!
If he''d got a dollar for everytime his guests were impressed by his research, he would've been a millionare.
Ole Runnynose Ed. Love it. ♥
I actually pour sweat from my head watching this
Why is the intro music so extra lol
Loving the pirates of the Caribbean -esque music. Lol
Oh Lewis black needs to come on this show
You should get Rainn Wilson and Steve Carell on here!!
Don't bother.
This felt so genuine!  Love Ed Helms and this show!
Big Spicy Tuna
It's Egg actually.
Yo, where can I find top trending video and movie?
That's funny I'm literally eating boiled peanuts right now
He handled that well....Try to get Seth Mcfarlane on the Show. That would be hilarious.
First question Sean asks... Ed Helms "well, that's a great question..."
That was a VERY awkward ending
Since we are on Ed, why not get Eminem to do the show??😅😅😅
please bing in Canelo Alvarez.
"don't bother" I.e. i hope i survive this and i'll be eating 0 spicy foods ever again.
The Office Fans Like
Get corey taylor on here
*Egg Helms
I’ve been Watching Sean for years, I’ve actually starting taking mental notes on how he talks with his guest. It’s helped me out in my social life so much, I can pick up on something they need mentioned. Then use that topic to ask questions that gets them to open up and talk about themselves,(which most people love doing).
The Lonesome Trio is a serious Rec if you’re at all into Folk/Bluegrass/Country Blues.
why do they have two awkward ass round tables?
"Jeff who lives at home" is a very underrated movie, amazing it was improvised.
Shout out Here Comes Treble!
I saw "The Hangover" movies first. So when I started watching "The Office" on Netflix I was genuinely surprised to see Ed Helms on there.
"don't bother" - Ed Helms 2022
I love " Hot One's". I'm always looking to see which of the guest is going to wipe their mouth and use the same napkin to wipe their face 🤣🤣🤣
One giant table please. Having two tables awkwardly set against each other looks stupid
We need Joe Burrow on this
Love it when you guys showing Sean suffering along with the guest! Makes him seem less of an Iron Man and I dig that.
Actually, his name is Egg Helms.
Go Andy!!!
I feel like I’m also numb to sauces like Sean after watching so many episodes🤧
Love bruh but get LIL BABY ON HERE !! That mf a hit off rip 😂
Mark Twain said a Gentleman can play the Banjo and doesn't.
Mark Twain said a Gentleman can play the Banjo and doesn't.
Is that the Nard Dog 🐶
Will we ever see Tom Cruise on Hot Ones? I hear he likes to do his own stunts!
So he didn’t go to Cornell? He still better have sang “Here Comes Treble”
I want to know if he really got the nard dog tattoo
Been watching since season 1. Never been this early. Thank you guys   💔💔💔💔
Banjos were originally created by enslaved African Americans based on traditional African instruments and then taken or sold by their slave masters. Most music and playstyles involving banjos is from or inspired by the racist minstrel shows in the 1800s and 1900s, and is completely different than the music and style it was originally made for.
Sean "Great Question" Evans
rit-dit-dit-di-do!!
Never heard someone say "ow ow ow" on this show. 😄
PROPS ON THE BACKGROUND MUSIC BEING THE PIANO SONG FROM THE HANGOVER
I love Egg Helms! Weird his name was spelled and pronounced wrong.
“Don’t bother.”
Love me some Boiled Peanuts.....best roadside food ever!
Gotta love Egg Helms
Andy really thought he could handle the heat
"Don't bother."  I'm dead.
He handled da bomb like a CHAMP
Boiled peanuts are fucking delicious...I have  had to have them shipped to me for the last 15 yrs since I moved north. Pimento cheese is another fucking crazy delicious too.
What interview did he do after this? I wanna see how wrecked he was lol
16:40 I swear I can see a puff of smoke come out of Ed's mouth when he exhales here
Don’t bother hahahah
I love Ed Helms! So glad he smashed this!
It was hilarious when Sean asked Ed to do a voice over for Asbestos when his nickname was Asbestos Mouth 😆
If I didn't know this mans movies I'd legit be like who tf is this guy that looks almost like Stephen Colbert , he looks like your dentist.
This show needsNicholas Cage
he looks older now than he looked years ago
Oh man it's so funny how Sean is giving these weirdo pedestrian questions during Ed's the Bomb fall out. I really enjoy the little cheeky smile after he asks him about pimento sandwiches.
I made a video on my channel testing the best cures to counter spicy food, but I may make a part 2 if there's anything you want me to try
Very funny man. Huge fan
Bro whats in da bomb
Aunty Donna next then
The most underated guy in hangover
He's not hawt. He's gay
I never knew this guy’s name. Face don’t match the name lmao
I would love to get some freeze dried wings from wherever they get them or make them. Either already sauced or unsauced. The wings look so chunky and tasty.
We need Dana White on this show
Does the hot ones box ship to other countries or do you have stockists in the UK?
I'm pretty sure his name is 'Egg' Helms.  Come on, get it right Hot Ones...
I feel like this is the most I’ve seen Sean struggle/suffer in an interview in a long long time!
Billy Connolly plays banjo too. Hook up!!!
IT'S THE NARD DOG!!
Crazy to think that a show about wings would have such great interviews XD
Andy! Stu!
Can I get a hoyaaaaa
I would love to watch these celebs for like 20mins after the show is done in like the “decompression chamber” reviving themselves or falling apart. 🤣🤣
No ones asking, but Da Bombs sauce has an Ionizing Radiation symbol not a Biohazard symbol
Would love to see the press junket after this. It’s come up a few times that the interviewee is nervous about the rest of the day- would love to see HOT ONES mentioned after the fact.
mono audio?  Love ed so much though such a damn stud.
Hahaha that very last thing Ed said Assistant: "And we're gonna package those bottles for you..." Ed: "....Don't bother." 😆  Great video!
Banjo and accordion defense: Steve Martin and Weird Al Yankovic
This show is FUNNY, and SMART, and DWHUMANIZING 😂
Do these celebrities not watch the show? How does Beyond Insanity always seem like a complete surprise?
Omg! I love him so much ❤️🤣
It's so emotional to see someone make it to the Last Dab! What a triumph XD Love this show! Love Ed Helms. Love the Hot Ones crew! <3
Helms is boring, couldn't sit through the whole video.
They spelled Eggs name wrong.
NO WAY NO WAY ED HELMS!!!!
Ed Helms mic drop:  "Don't bother"  lol
You should interview either Maluma or J Lo since Marry Me is coming out soon
You're killing the Nard Dog here!
Heyy, it's Mickey, my friend!
Michael Jim and Dwight in one episode 😂💯
DOM: And we're gonna package up those sauces for you, so you can take them home.   ED: Don't bother.
Reddit di di dooooooooooooooooooooo!
Youtube needs to recommend videos of follow up interviews that guests are on... I really want to see someone tell their interview they are still suffering from Hot Ones :p
would like to see Dwight in this
What celebrity wouldn't pay to be on this show?
Fun story: A banjo player was traveling through the northeast looking for gigs. During his NY stop, he accidentally left his banjo in the rental car overnight.  When he came out in the morning,  sure enough,  someone had smashed the rear passenger glass to get inside. In a panic, he looked inside......   2 banjos.
im just sitting here waiting for "HotTwo's"
Love the you made it weird shoutout. Pete would be great on here
You did a great job Ed!! I have all the sauces at home and I think you might have done better than me.
I wonder how sick Sean is of chicken
nard dawg
He did not have fun 😂
How many guests have requested to take home a variety of the sauces?
Paging Dr F 😊
After buying the hot ones lineup, and experiencing it a few times now. I have such a higher level of respect for Sean doing this day in and day out.
A root a doot doo doot doo.
Wow! Its rare to see physically signs of Sean losing it. Not gonna lie, that shook me a bit.
Uh... pretty sure that's Egg Helms...
Thankfully there's no walls there. Was afraid he bout to put a hole in your wall
Ed helms made me tear up in the podcast with Brian baumgartner
Oh wow! Love Ed Helms and he rocked it. As usual and certainly deserved, Sean is praised for his amazing interviewing skills.
16:00 what we came for lol
Great job doing what Rob Corddry couldn’t!!!
You don’t realize how thin these sauces are until you get a bottle lol
Typo. It's actually Egg Helms.
This made me so happy, i love ed helms! John Krasinski next!!
This is crazy last night I watched the hangover and this came out this morning
Love the guests. Seen all of em. What about Corey Taylor!
were gonna pack those up for you. DONT BOTHER!!!! lol
Does Sean’s teeth look different? Or am i buggin
0:51 typical Andy “they called me ace” “they called me boner champ” etc…. Hahaha that’s hilarious
So we thinking 36 hours before this one has more views than last week's?
Jeff who lives at home is an amazing movie.
get Jordan Peterson.,
Jheeeeez amazing 2 people so far this season
He passed 👍🏾 👏🏾 got throw that shit
Okay, you guys SERIOUSLY need to get Mike Rowe on Hot Ones!
If ive said anything here before ill say it again. We *need* #steve1989mreinfo on this show but bust the wings onto a tray
Andy still misses Erin 😭
I had a look at their season 17 ten bottle box and it's a different Da Bomb than the one they use on the show.  Maybe that's a good thing.
We're going to package up those sauces for your to take home Don't bother
Please get Kid Cudi to do this!
This show is my favorite , i feel like i know all these stars personaly after watching them brake down 💯🔥👍👍👍
Ed's face said it all - eyes, nose, mouth leaking all over his face. SO GOOD.   Crew Member: "We will box that all up so you can take it home."   Ed: "Don't bother."   hahahahaha
I've never understood why your guests aren't given the common courtesy of the exclusive use of drumettes.
cheers i'm dumpin some buffalo sauce in my spaghettios to get with the vibes love you sean
Why only 1 instagram photo mentioned for the deep dive instagram?
Do not resuscitate
I did not know that was his name
It's amazing that Joe Rogan has been on you show, that would break the internet, get him! No one give a shit about guest
Ahh. Who the fuck is Ed Helms? Do you mean the actor/writer/producer Egg Helms?
Ed is at the helm for this one.
ah yes it's mickey, my friend
Great interview guys! But when are we gonna get back to 1 table?
This show got stupid
We need a supercut of guests telling Sean “that’s a great question” and “you really do your research”
what a scary ride! Another great guest and show! luv yah Sean!!
What's not to like about Ed? Seems like a great guy and he's pretty darn funny as well.
I want to know what his next interview was so can watch and see the pain he's in lmao
RIDIDIDID DIDOOOO
Nice to see you Andy!
HAVE MORE PEOPLE FROM THE OFFICE CAST ON HOT ONES PLEASE! :)
I love Sean so much!
I’m on my 3rd last episode of the office and this shows up. Just watched Andy shit on Wallace’s car
You can see that Andy's anger management training really paid off :))
It’s egg. Egg helms how does nobody know this
Just watched The Hangover Part 2 the other day. Shit is SLEPT ON
Is been how many seasons Da Bomb been on cause wow that hot sauce isn't pulling any punches still
It would be funny to see the next interview these people have. Hahah.
great to see sean tear up once in a while !
Sean looks high as hell in the episode lol
The fact that I'm wearing my Nard Dog hoodie today, AND watching the Nard Dog on Hot Ones... best day ever.
Ah-Ah Andy and the Tuna
Wow. He did well!
They REALLY need to have you on SNL
Love this guy!
Lol
Snottie Pippen!
Dude... Ed is awesome
Andy, was such a great hilarious character hahaha this guy is great
Once again the best ! Hot ones rules 🥵
El es Pablo Chacon
OMG.. the ad read! Never recognized him as the mesothelioma guy!
PLEASE GET ANDREW GARFIELD ON THIS SHOW
Steve carell would be legendary
Classic!
The Nerd dog got burnt in this one! Shout out Big Tuna and Lady Tuna!

that 'don't bother' at the very broke me hahahaha
Ed - "My brothers called me asbestos tongue" Andy - "They called me buzz. But I still aced all my tests. They called me Ace"
Have a whole new level of respect for Ed Helms from this video, knew he was a solid dude from Aunty Donna but god damn this just pushed it over the top, much love for him and Hot ones for this amazing vid 💛
selling the whole set as a box is sick, going in on that bad boy
I almost want to be mad at Sean for hurting poor Ed! :D
i just love ed helms man
Get Ed Helms to ask iron Mike.
"My brother called me asbestos tongue" False. His name was "Buzz"
Hey we are gonna pack up those sauces for you!  Don’t bother.  Lololol
Makes me happy when the guests appreciate Sean’s questions
I think you need to make videos called aftermath that show the guests in the subsequent interviews they had to do after the wings of death.
We need Mike Tyson to do Hot Ones.  Everyone has a plan until they eat a Da Bomb wing.
Should've served the hot sauces with big tuna.
Am I crazy or do I hear Gwynns theme lmfao
Andy
I had no idea “Jeff who lives at home” was fully improvised! I’m going to re watch it asap. Ed Helms is always so high spirited, what a great interview Sean
They Titled the Video wrong. It should be Egg not Ed.
I want to see Jocko Willink!!!!
Day 2 of asking for Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki
Can I have Ed's bottles of hot sauce? He didn't want them. Lol
His voice is so iconic I can't not hear Andy every time he talks XD
*Egg Helms
"We're gonna pack those bottles up for you."  "Don't bother!"
Another great episode
Wanna see a montage of people saying "hmm that's a good question"
I think Ed Helms is the first guest on this show that I've felt bad for lol
It's actually Egg Helms
You should get the McElroy brothers! They would lose it!! It would be hilarious.
Sean Evans is the best host ever! who's with me?
Thank you Hotones for a other amazing episode 👊
Big shout out to the fact that turbo tax lobbies the government to make doing your taxes harder so that you have to do it thru them. FUCK TURBO TAX
Oh yay! Ed Helms. Very much looking forward his interview.
I cannot describe how proud I feel when Sean gets praise for his questions
Hot Ones Producers: And we gone pack you some of these sauces Ed Helms: don't bother 😂 😂
The older I've gotten, the more normal I've realized it is for people to miss their lateral incisor and that's cool! I'm missing mine too!
Reggie Makes Music: Ed Helms Youtube that^
You better get Todd Packer next, David Koechner the man, the myth, the legend
Paminto cheese is f n nasty even the good stuff has a bad ending taste.
Paging doctor f( _can't say that word anymore_ )t
Didn’t he go to Cornell?
NARD DOG IN THE HOUSE!
next guests jim and pam
'We're gonna package these up for ya...'  Ed: Don't bother.   LOL
Just as I literally finished rewatching The Office, what a timing
Steve Carell next please!!
Ed Helms is the best
I want to know what interview he did afterwards, and I want to see it!
I love how he was actually in an a cappella group in college.
I love hot ones.  I always show everyone the gordon ramsay episode.  I was always curious how the fake tooth from the hangover worked.
I love Egg Helms! Glad Hot Ones could get him on the show.
This was so wholesome. Great episode.
you got too love this guy!!
NARD DOG
Cedar Rapids mite be my fav Ed Helms film, hidden gem classic
Nard Dog!
‘My brother called me asbestos tongue’ sounds exactly like something Andy would say
Thank you for bringing him on your show. Now it makes since why Andy talked like that in The Office and The Hangover movies are AWESOME!!
Loved it 🥰
Wonderful detox from Gordon Ramsay... Ed´s a great dude.
5:20 no wonder that movie sucks so much what a waste of time
This show is heavily over produced 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Let’s do it :)
It's Led Tasso!
I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.
So my only critique is when Sean asks 2 questions on one subject. The guest usually only answers one of the two. Not sure if that's the spice or just the way they edit. Still, incredible interviewing skills👌
ROO DOO DOO DOO-DOO!!!
Don't sleep on Jeff Who Lives at Home. It's such a great movie.
My son made a comment yesterday that "Andy from The Office" would make a good Joker, and I think he's totally right... I can 100% picture Ed Helms as a deranged psycho killer with a man crush on the Caped Crusader
We need jordan belfort on here
Ed should make a hot ones song
Oberlin College
Need DOJA CAT on Hot Ones!!!!!!
If 'tired' was a human, it would be Ed Helms.
Sean feeling da bomb today
The really good interviews, like this, always fly by so fast!
Who go straight to da bomb?
I wasn't sure if I was imagining how red Eds eyes got but oh my god dude!! 😂
I collect hotsauces and tried "The Bomb" years before "The Hot Ones" ever aired. Not only is it hot af but it tastes AWFUL! It's just nasty bitter LAVA. I have no idea why anyone would use it on or in anything besides as a challenge lol
Classic Egg Helms
<3 Ed Helms <3 Yay <3 :)
4:07 Great advice for trying to make it as a comedian!
Ngl ive always thought Ed Helms was not that funny.
I hate accordions whoever decided to give a piano asthma should be shot lol 😂
Ed Helms is the GOAT!  Much love Hot Ones!
Egg Helms
Nailed It
Man I love Egg Helms.
Get Bradley Cooper on this channel.
the asymmetric bags under his eyes are super distracting
16:30 Is there a tiger, a jungle cat in your mouth Ed?
I can't be the only one who wants to see the interview he taped *after* this.
Whoever made this title spelled Egg Helms wrong.
I just realized Ed is McLovin's father. I wonder if he knows.
FINALLY SOMEONE FROM THE OFFICE HOLY SHITTTTTT!! You guys need to do Steve Carrell now😭 THIS WAS LIT
Every time I see Ed Helms I think of Nard Dog and say Ri di dit dit di doo
Never thought to see Andy on here
Egg Helms?
Always been a huge fan of Ed Helms. Love this show
I absolutely love this guy!!! Seems so real and down to earth! So excited to watch!
hes definitely been to calabria before....
Oh Andy…
Around the eyes! BE CAREFUL!
When someone starts struggling before dabomb you know you are in for a treat
Hey-oo!
<3
I love the fire on the bottles! It's wild it took 17 seasons to think of it, but it's awesome. Tell the person who thought of it that it's great.
Da Bomb gets em every time lol
Please get Steve Carell !!!
3:14 the music...perfect.
roo doo doo doo doo
NARD DOGGGG
John Krasinski and Steve Carrell Please
How about getting YouTube legend Tom Scott on here, especially after the hot sauce ice cream episode? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZCwg_9zq2A
All I'm saying- Tom Brady couldn't eat nightshades (peppers) before he retired. I was never a fan of his while he played, but trying to say he's not the best QB of NFL history would be insane. Pls market as hard as you can to get him on the show.
“Are you seriously still trying to do this interview now?!” 😅😆
oh shit it’s egg helms
Keep taking those wings tuna
The music transition from the first sauce to the second…too damn funny.
They don't teach that in Cornell huh
When he played banjo in the Mumford and sons music video. 🔥
How about some guests that people actually want to watch?!
Will never forgive Ed Helms for forgetting how to play Andy in The Office after The Hangover. Him saying he’s proud of it shows how dumb he is
Boring Ive never said that about this show
I thought he was going to scream ''what the f*ck is going on?!''.
Why would you schedule anything for the rest of the day after going on Hot Ones?
I’m that 999 like that was for juice world love your content first we feast keep up the great work
Nard dog going in on those wings
Hes got one tooth too many.
Eds movie with Jason segel(Jeff who lives at home) is actually the bomb of a movie tbh... ❤️
SPICEKOUR!
Micky my friend!
He's about to lose his freaking mind
Nominating Matt Stonie.
Bagpipes are one of those instruments you hate or love, I fell asleep to them as a kid.
We need Bobby Flay!!!
The Nard Dog himself!
When I was in college, I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was "Puke." I would chug a fifth of So-Co, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, boot, rally, more So-Co, head to class. Probably would have gotten expelled if I'd let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses. They called me "Ace." It was totally awesome. I got straight B's. They called me "Buzz."
is that Egg Helms from Aunty Donna's Big Ol' House of Fun????
loved him in Tag - underrated movie
The Nard-Dog!!
Its Andy
MICKEY MY FRIEND
It's nice to see "Andy" and "Jim" working together again.
Rit dit dit dit dooo
It'd be great to have BJ Novak on Hot Ones.. the guy seems to be one of those guys who has a lot of stories to tell.
STOLTMAN BROTHERS!!!
Since you're running out of guests, you might as well get the Chicken Connoisseur from YouTube...
one table format.  bring it back.
Mickey! My friend! I've got some wings for you Mickey... they're right outside Mickey...come on out and eat them Mickey. Mickey!
So glad they finally got Egg Helms on the show!
Sean is absolutely a god tier interviewer it's insane, give this man 100 shows.
Sorry this season has weak sauces in it …. Only contender is Apollo X .  The da bomb is just garbage - so that doesn’t count . Retire the battery acid🙏
Drop a like on this masterpiece
Ed Helms on the outside looks like just some boring ass dad, but secretly had a very amazing and  interesting life stories.
He look, and sound like a sober steve-o.
"I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them." GOAT of the quotes🙌
I love himmmmm 🥰
Andyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! god i miss The Office.
If they got Nardwuar, it would be the ultimate interview.
egg helms
Yo
His exempt to have a sequel for National Lampun Vacation, was his lowest point, it sucked. But he was great 👍 in the Office and The Hangover Trilogy, and Jeff Who Still Lives At Home, and Tag
Ed Helms is hella Funny 🤣😂
Jim would be an awesome guest too. love these guests!!
You should interview Nardwuar! That would be top tier 👌🏻
Love all of his stuff. Except office. Hate that show
Riddle doodle doo
When the relaxing, nostalgic music slowed to a stop because of the heat lol
Gotta love a bit of egg helms
Waking up and seeing hot ones just dropped always makes my thursdays good :)
Absolutely loved Ed in VACATION! My families favourite comedy!!!
I want to see Ismo Leikola in there :D
Vacation was the funniest comedy sequel of all time.  I watch it twice a year at least.
Mickey! My friend
So his show is Drunk History but with no drinking. And not about history??????
Hell yeah! This is going to be a great interview I just know it.
Surprisingly humble guy. Great interview as always.
The nerd hillbilly!
NARD DOG 🤴🏻!!!!!
Some nice one liners from Ed...mouth medic, car crash, my nose is sprinting🤣

(#416) Ed Helms is so great!!! Thanks Sean!!!
Love from scotland!
Hot Ones makes me feel hot & Iʼm just watching them.
No Regerts!
I have loved everything about this show since the beginning, but I’m not feeling the fire on the lids of the bottles this season. Fire is hot. Hot sauce is spicy. Not the same thing.
Ed is just the coolest. Love him sm.
Corporate Media will never have felt amount of pain they deserve for what they've done into our society
I love Egg Helms!
