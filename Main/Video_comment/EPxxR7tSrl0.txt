Thai pairs could win easily in their match point, yet Phuangphuapet didn't kill it at 1:07:37 Is this anything to do with lifetime banned players lately?

This Thai pair is excellent！👍👍👍

) David Kilgour, former Secretary of State for Asian-Pacific, and David Matas, international human rights lawyer, have investigated the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) state-sanctioned organ harvesting from live Falun Gong practitioners for several years and published their investigation reports.   During the virtual online rally held on July 20, 2020, they put forward several suggestions to the Canadian government including using the Magnitsky Act to sanction the 14 CCP officials who have participated in the persecution of Falun Gong.  Matas Proposes Ten Suggestions to Canadian Government to Stop the Live Organ Harvesting Renowned human rights lawyer David Matas proposed suggestions in his speech to end the CCP's killing of Falun Gong practitioners.  “My particular focus when addressing the persecution of Falun Gong has been the mass killing of Falun Gong for their organs in transplants,” he said.   “The question I would try to briefly answer is how can Canada contribute to ending the abuse. In the short time I have, I have suggestions to make very quickly.  “First of all, Parliament should enact immediately Bill S-204 which has all party support and which criminalizes complicity in organ transplant abuse abroad.   “Second, parliament should amend the state immunity act to shoulder the civil liberty liability in complicity in transplant abuse abroad.  “Third, the government of Canada should sign and ratify the council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs.  “Fourth, the government of Canada should raise Chinese organ transplant abuse at the United Nations human rights council under the agenda item human rights situations that require council’s attention.   “Fifth, the government of Canada should name Chinese organ transplant abuse perpetrators under the Canadian Magnitsky legislation.   “Sixth, the government of Canada should impose specific immigration ban on those complicit in organ transplant abuse abroad.   “Seventh, a provincial legislature should enact mandatory reporting by health administrators and health officials of transplant tourism.  “Eighth, a provincial legislature should prohibit insurance coverage for transplant tourism.  “Ninth, the health and bioethics profession should set out specific bioethical and professional standards against complicity in transplant abuse abroad.  “And tenth, Canadian hospitals and universities should adopt policies standing against any assistance of hospitals and doctors complicit in organ transplant abuse abroad.   “I suggest action on all 10 of these proposals, but even if only one of them were realized, we would be better off than we are now in avoiding complicity and helping to prevent the mass killing of practitioners of Falun Gong for their organs.”
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Hallelujah! Repent and turn from sin! Obey God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out.
wow, this thai pair is really energetic, good, and enjoyed their match till the end. they just need some experience then they would become a beast. hoping a best future for them..
Listen to this, it is not spam, the most important thing you'll ever read.   If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality, rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in selfish child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the believers in Christ/Christians will be taken up, away with God, the world will be in turmoil, then the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, receive Jesus as your savior, believe God raised Jesus from the dead (Romans 10:9), and repent of your sins, you are now saved by grace! (NOT BY WORKS)

For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
Tiap mas jom serve suka deg deg an...congrats BTW jar/jom semoga JUARA
Ardianto kalau lagi bagus main nya,  👍👍👍Banget!! Tapi kalau lagi kurang fokus,  demam panggung, skills nya ngga keluar,  toloooooong!! 😖😣 Errors nya itu kebangetan, bikin geleng2 kepala!! SUMPAH!! 😣😖😔 Kalau Alfian lebih stabil.
Fajri mainnya standart2 cuma main cepat ngandalin power n drive2 aja kurang bervariasi placing2nya

Nice blue color
Tetap semangat dan konsisten brader!!!
Erornya banyak ya, jantung pada aman kagak
It's inexcusable for world level MD player like Rian Ardianto to suck so badly at short serve. This pair will never reach the top if this weakness continued.
Biru🥵🥵
Yahh kan kalah😢 makanya klo poinnya blm jauh gak usah tereak² dlu ntar klo udah jauh bru deh puas²sin teriaknya(itupun klo menang yah🙏) Nah kan emosi gw😂
Berapa kali jantung brdetak dalam satu menit
Mampus thailand berisik

Wow, the Thai pair really choked. That's what separates the very good from the top. Alfian and Ardianto kept their composure
Udah teriak2 matchpoint, ternyata kalah😂😂
I’m a man. I saw new BWF clips, I clicked like. Anyway Alfian’s hair is cute
