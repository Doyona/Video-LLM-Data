9:12. The UFC knows what they are doing.
Cyrill is literally the chillest guy ever
Awesome
Bet that Asian woman enjoy touching the champion
0:56 would hate to be this guy's neighbour!
It's in God's hands, but I trained to kill.  Oi Figueiredo!!! ever heard of the 10 commandments?
Apple and peanut butter 🧈
BRO FRANCIS HAS SOME WHITE FUCKING FEET OMG. Whiter than a irish man
I feel like Francis is not taking Gane seriously. I get the feeling he's looking too far into the future and not stopping to see whats in front of him. His ego is showing. Gane is no slouch.
So crazy that gane and tom segura are friends
That hair dresser has the downs 8:05
Both these heavyweights have same personality as a plank of WOOD 🪵
Allez Cyril
Peanut butter with an apple dafuq
Gane looks like he is so chilll.... someone that could hang with anyone - Hope he gets his and raised “and new”
This guy is two faced, he says "i respect you" at the face off and at the end of this video he calls him a joke. Wtf.
Cyril game can pursue a drill rapper career too.
Peanut butter on the apple?
figgy has to move up
AY!! The green apple with peanut butter, that's a DAILY! 🔥
Figueredo has some wide ass feet. 3:44
5:15 of course his golf swing is precision
6:08 my car when I start it
I liked figgy in the cage, he's annoying on embedded, so now he's annoying
Francis learned English quickly
It's interesting how often people have referenced Phoenix rising from the ashes, considering it's directly correlated  with evil taking control of the world. Not saying this dude is evil, just saying seen folks of the lie using that line.
Are fighters getting paid for embeddeds ? 🙄
Frances says gon is a joke
Gane said he was happy and proud why would he say that to that machine standing in front of him
Is there a after version of Francis's massage session with BBC at work? Asking for a friend. 🤣🤣
Morenos not even sweating or breathing heavy. 🤦‍♂️ Dayum.
I bet Francis got a tuggy after his massage
Sucks seeing what $ did to ngannou
kinda love both these guys
The UFC has a LOT of bantamweight fights recently the past few years.  Some of these are really good fights don't get me wrong but would rather see fights at the minimum 145 and above.  I just can't relate to anyone 5'5''-5'6'' 135 lbs.  That is very short and lightweight.  125 lb'ers are almost freak show short/small.
🙌
9:17
FRESH AND FIT PODCAST🔥🔥🔥🔥💪.
the fact the champ, Moreno, is doing the "hardest training camp" in his life from his home garage, shows you just how very little the UFC pays it's talent
Lol defender on proclubs
Circle Gane's coach looks like Tom Segura
Fight week feels 🔥
6:09 what was that laugh 😂
9:20 wtf is his feet
Figuerido is so annoying
@9:20 that man has the whitest feet on an African I’ve ever seen
yooo GANE is just chillen HAHAHA
you know how Francis improved in English when they removed subtitles
that dude is insane, he can fight, he can dance, he's good at soccer and basketball, he is top 100 in the world in a videogame, he can probably even cook, wtf is this?
He’s even happy when he plays fifa
Does the cameraman have a foot fetish lmao???
figgy acted like a douchbag during the prefight press conference but he seems like a good dude just trying to sell the fight. idk just my opinion
8:15 man those chemtrails...
Doing research for Hamilton to play Lafayette. This is a class on French dialect lol
Can someone explain what the diffrence between ngannous and ganes belt is ?
Ciryl qui joue a fifa avant le combat🤣👏👏 bon gamin
Why does Gane's coach look exactly like Tom Segura? xD
4x4224
42424x
24244x2
2242
if you think deiveson didnt get a pay under table to loose the first match, you dont know. if you know, you know.
Oh man Moreno is training hard af! I don't see him losing.
Moreno will get smoked , and n ganu will get knocked out .
I see the Diaz’s signed Brandon to their Represent brand.
Keep playing video games...but when you get knocked out you'll know it ain't no fucking game!!
Dang. Ngannou and Gane are the most likable heavyweights ever.
Tom Segura is trying Gane!
Peacefulness is the choice I make and I wish people the best on whatever there going through everyday can be a fight when you feel like your in competition
Bonne chance Francis. Nous avons confiance en toi. Nous savons que tu gagneras.
Gane with the better console that’s what’s up.
I fail to understand why so many top level Brazilians fail to learn English, international fighters elsewhere seem to understand the importance of it to sell fights.
Interesting.  Never knew that Figgy created the God of War video game series.   He is truly a renaissance man .
Ripp Van Wrinkle
Francis is big black guy with white boy feet
Its a shame there arent enough flyweights that can shake things up. Cuz if figgy wins theyll definitely run it a 4th time
Going to be a great night
His pec weighs more than 100 pounds 🤣🤣
As a die hard mma guy ive learned that waiting until Thursday to binge watch the first 5 embeddeds get me super hyped for #6 And ofcourse the fight Saturday
She likes “heavy duty table cause Francis is like 100 pounds” ..  No … I’m like 100 pounds, Francis is fuckn unit.
Francis having happy ending
I don't know how Figuredo gets another rematch so fast? Is that division super low on challengers? It's like the UFC wants Moreno to lose!
Yall put this man in your main events, your thumbnails and constantly post videos of his KO's now please pay him don't let him go over money 🙏
5:53  Tom Segura's doppelganger
Triple rat always training the enemy 😂
Gane is a Teddy bear 🧸 he seems like a top bloke
Gane bought a ps5 to play fifa? 🤦🏻‍♂️
There's never been a main event in the history of ufc with 2 fighters with zero charisma
Moreno sounds like a fucking gibbon
Iv just noticed YouTube unsubscribed me from the UFC channel! Wtf! I will never forgive them for this. Premium account and I know I would never do that myself, they are taking everything I work for lol.
Ngannou training hard🤷‍♂️ gane playing Pro clubs 😂
LETS GO BRANDON, NO NO NO FOR REAL THIS TIME
Cyril Gane World Heavyweight FIFA Champion, that‘s crazy
Gooooo Gane!!!!
Last time yall slept on francis somebody else got slept keep on sleeping francis will Still Be the Undisputed UFC Heavyweight Champion
Get a 6'4 bodybag ready cirly is going to need it The Predator will give him a permanent rest
J
Can we see a DC and Gane golfing interview please?
cool to see as finn how much pro athletes use sauna for relaxing
Brandon's mom: limpia tu cuarto cabron  Brandon: Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow or maybe not de next month pero- *GETS CHANKLETASO*
This is the most soft spoken main card, ALL OF THEM ARE SO KIND
Den roten Streifen macht er nicht mehr damit hat er verloren würde ich auch so machen hoffentlich  gewinnt moreno den finde ich irgendwie sympathischer
Technology......
Golfen die Jungs da an nem See?
What is Moreno adding to the apple at the beginning of the video ? I have never seen anyone do that
At 9:17 francis feet are more white than mine lol
Francis deserve two UFC's champ belts, after this fight he will leave Dana white speechless and panic...

Gane gonna bring that gold to France 🇫🇷
Whatever they saw in Francis isn’t going to get better in the U.S, yet alone superficial Las Vegas
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I love the idea that Gane is calm when facing opponents in the cage yet rages against teenagers on fifa
cyrle ganes 1 of the best in the world! oh its at soccer, no no 1 cares.
strange how little time Francis received in this episode ... being the HW champ
funny how they only gave ngannou 1 minute of promotion
i can beat gane           in fifa
Jesus I really thought Cyrils coach 'Ben' was Tom Segura for a moment there.
dammit, I don´t want Moreno, Figuredo, Gane or Ngannou to lose.
To think I couldn’t love Gane more and he’s a PlayStation fan, the future GOAT
Thanks.
Does somebody the song at 9:30, I forgot what it’s called
its insane what these people go through to get a check
Yet, here he is ready to whoop your ass and he is playing fuckin games.....just know I told you so big boy.
Francis doin it right with the Asian massage girl.   She got her work cut out for her if ya know what I mean 😉
Cool to see gane is 64 in the world in fifa lol
Gane literally sounds like he has a full cabbage in his mouth..
Ngannou Francis is looking for his nyama
Cyril Gane looks like the franchement rapper Booba
I appreciate the humility of Moreno
8:17 chemtrails ruining Mother Nature 🤦‍♂️
Francis got some white ass feet bro hahahaha
Honestly Figgy vs Moreno 3 shouldnt have happened. Moreno needs to defend that belt via other fighters
Imagine loosing against Cyril Gane in FIFA and calling him namens Not knowing who ur playing against
nice chemtrails 8:15
Damn Cyril is 64th on fifa ! ? ! That’s wild , dude most almost never lose.
I think Francis is going to underestimate Ciryl
If Gane beats Francis he’s going to be a dominant Champion. His skillset is off the charts compared to other fighters
Brandon is such an amazing dude, he inspires me
Anyone know what game mode Gane is playing on Fifa?
Just wanted to give a shout out to the camera man that got the close up of the bottoms of Francis’s feet.
I could probably take most of the fly weights with one hand behind my back,
Y’all need Jesus
Silver play buttons?
Francis sleeps  Ciryl
Real fighter
Morenooooooo
Is that peanut butter on apple?
I love how Gane is low key ranked number 64 of the world in fifa 😂
I thought Cyril was playing golf with Tom Segura 😭
Francis is like 100 pounds? I think she ment 1000 pounds
Wow. The commercial was so racist
Francis always sounds like he's telling you a secret
Was that peanut butter on apple?
🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲💪🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
I can't wait for Gane to beat his ass and send him packing.  Tired of 'champs' who refuse fights and always bicker with Dana.
WTF! 62bpm at 60% so 230bpm max at 28 year old! Moreno he's in shape!!! 😅
I love that Moreno trains in his garage!
Could you imagine talking trash to a fifa opponent... Only for it to be Ciryl Gane XD.
Fights sound crazy but the ppv price to watch is crazier. 80$ bro! Thanks ESPN !
Figueiredo's son's impression of a dinosaur is pure rage
100 something Lbs Francis, what a manlet.
How can you not like Francis?
why is literally nobody talking about emotional figgy is coming across in every interview
Brandon just crawl out of bed?!? Love that kid!!
Wtf Moreno!?? Apple with chocolate… please man, eat bitter
Was Gane playing FIFA 2002?
Is Cyril’s coach is Tom segura?
Everyone's so likeable lol just got to hope for good fights regardless of the victor
Also I used to like Francis, but something about his demeanor has seemed to change. Went from a humble guy go whT seems borderline arrogant IMO. Hes a hard hitter but Ciryl is SMART. Intelligence beats brute power most of the time.
Table and therapist too small for Francis
Ciryl you are opening the face of your club to much. That's why you keep slicing. 💯
Is this guy wearing AirPods the other way around?
Final song?
@2:15 Venize bitch
Ngannou can do audio books after he retires.
Goddammit u cameraman shooting such a vulgar scene, 9:12 🥸
Ngannou got them big ass potato smasher feet 🤣
god bless you
Lol Moreno eating an apple with peanut butter on it 😂. That’s what happens when you weigh as much as a small child.
Lookin at ngannous feet when hes gettin a massage youd nvr think it wasa black guy lol...
MEXICO🇲🇽 VS BRAZIL🇧🇷 BABY!!!!!
Ciryl gane accidentally leaking his PSN name
I wish I was Brandon’s friend
🥱
Big talk from a illegal immigrant
Is Quentin Tarantino directing these?
figgy pretending he didnt get smoked last time
What is with UFC fighters wanting to be golfers?
Francis - happy ending ?
Two days ago I played a whole game of fornite with max Holloway and baby max and I didn’t even know it until the end of the match when he said GG brothers I was l was like wait is this max Holloway he said yeah nice playing with ya later brothers I was sooooooo surprised I added him and could never play with him again 😭😭😭
In all honesty is Gane is gonna get starched lol
I hope Ngannuo losses seems so arrogant, go on Gane
"i dont want peace i want problems" 3:13
there is no better way to prep for the big fight
First Embedded Video. Gane play FIFA and Golf. Classic
Figueiredo must be a bit confused, he got beaten too hard by Moreno, you actually get a new belt each fight, so no matter who wins, you get a new belt. Moreno will beat him again (for the third time)
Apples and peanut butter, super healthy and full of protein. Good work
Is it me or does Moreno keep his chin up kinda high
You didn’t come up with the god of war it’s a game kratos
Francis talking a lot of shit..
The 2 baddest men on the planet turn out to be some of the nicest too! haha
Gane looks like he’s added even more mass. I believe he can do a lot of damage to Ngannou, especially his legs
me at @5:55 "Why is Tom Seguar there?"
it's weird to see that francis is slowing becoming  a villian.
I have a feeling Gane is gonna dominate than get kod last second
did i really just see a guy eating an apple with fucking peanut butter on it??
All 270 Fighter In This Video : "Preparing For His Fight At Saturday like training and Stretch their muscle by massage"  Gane : "Keep Calm And Playing FIFA Babe".
Francis Ngannou vs Ciryl Gane is so 50/50. We will find out really fast in the first round who is going to win the fight.
PlayStation 5 ❤️
Gane 👐
Gane is like a big kid with manners but is deadly inside the ring,its gonna be a good one
100 pounds? I dont think think she should be in physical therapy.
What, no happy ending for Francis?
HOLY SHIT Gane's fifa ranking is insane. He plays A LOT and has been over many years I can tell
Even Cormier would beat Gane at Golf haha
Whats up with fighters and golf lol canelo loves golf too
I’ve noticed that EMBEDDED show a lot of shots of feet ….. is this on purpose hoping  to attract the foot fetish fans out there 🤔😂
THE CARD OF THE NICEST GUYS IN UFC
The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.
Moreno is Jordi El Nino Polla 😂😂😂
Gabi Garcia turning her hand to hair dyeing, I see...
My money is on Gane & Moreno $$$$
Ngannou playing a local music from back home is so cool. Let's make it happen again on Saturday champ
Lent he beat you easy twice
Nutella apple, that's the secret
5:40 Tom Segura is that you?
Francis Ngannou built like a tank but has the voice of an ASMR instructor.
I'm slowly starting to dislike Francis. Whatever there may be, calling your old friend a joke is not cool. Especially when it looks like Gane harbors no ill will towards him. Maybe Dana was right after all about Francis' ego.
No way in hell you are ranked #64 in FUT and not score that 1V1...
What was homeboy at 2:23 talking about? Lol, def said the N word.
Cant believe Gane is being coached by the french Tom Segura
Uh oh, Figueiredo had a hair cut on Embedded. He's doomed!
All the fighters are training hard close to the fights...but the heavyweights are just vibing...
Ngannous feet give me a stiffy for some reason. Looking like two Turkish bread subs
The haircut/color...most important part of any camp
It's nice to see Tom Segura training Gane his golf skills
I can’t stand football games , Cyril you football fiend
when french ppls talk english ... it's total shit ... ear hurting !!!
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Hah you can see how pissed the UFC is with Francis with the air time they gave me compared to Gane
Masseusse: "He's like 100lb! ...  I mean kilos!" Ngannou: "I ain't even no middleweight!!"
Brandon Moreno is a really nice guy, but I don't think I'd want him as a neighbour.
I really like both Moreno and Figuredo
The lack of love for the champ is disgusting. Hoping for a knockout to shut them the fuck up for a while at least.
Didn't know Tom Segura was Ciryl Gane coach
Seeing figueiredo on the phone to his son on his 3rd bithday makes you realise how much these fighters really sacrifice to get to the top. Respect
Mc Lovin is gonna win again :)
I like how they all got love for they home country
Red baring on fifa💀
all 4 are great fighter, I wish they could all win
The dude is a UFC champ and he's training in a garage 🤦🏻‍♂️
No one :  Sound cloud rappers : 1:38
I like Gane as much as I like N’Gannou Much respect to them both!!
Cereal Gun
Masseuse be like fark me how long is it gonna take to massage this behemoth?
Chemtrails at 8:15
Does any other fighter besides Gane wear their own merch? Not even Conor I think
The anticipation is building day by day I can't wait for the 2 title fights, I hope for everyone's sake the fights are legendary    😉👉🏼👉🏼
I get that Figuerado is interesting and has funny jobs and shit, but he seems like a real douche and he always has.  He's constantly talking about death and decapitation and shit to the point where it's uncomfortable.  He just manufactures shit to get mad at his opponents about.  I never found him easy to root for, even when the media was pushing him like hell because he has an interesting backstory.
Team Moreno/Gane all day
Gane - "Always focus on mission, always" Also Gane: plays Fifa & Golf
When he was talking about the interim was he calling gane a joke? I didn’t too much understand
Figueredo looks like a crackhead here lol
Figi did an embedded haircut
6:08 when u get that gawk gawk 3000
I got the house on Gane....Francis is gona be way too weak from all those happy endings come fight day.
8:21 it starts
Figeriedos hair dresser looks like she is about to make her heavyweight day view on the Ngonnou vs gane undercard.
Gane sounds the scariest Cookie Monster but looks like a cool shrek and will get a badass Fiona if he whips Frances ass
9:23 you know this chick is living her best life xD
My favorite thing about this is that they don't put any background music in it.  The quiet really encapsulates the feel of the calm before the storm.
@9:20 wtf was that angle lmao
2:35 - Are my eyes playing tricks on me?  In the soccer game Gane is playing, the field at certain angles looks like it was mowed in circles, but at different angles it shows that it’s mowed vertically?
Is Gane loosing a FIFA game while talking about his fight a sign?
2 friendly giants. Unless you are in the cage with them, then God help you! 🤣
Gane seems likes such a down to earth dude.  Win or lose he’s gonna be one of my favorite fighters going forward
Gane plays pro clubs? I'm a fan of that
Francis reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Pumping Iron
I can't wait!!!! Going to be an awesome card!
Gane is a great guy but Francis by DEC.
Uuuugh, I reckon Figs needs to go up in weight. He looks to be killing himself. Moreno looks so damn good, strong and happy. I will be amazed if Moreno doesn't win fairly comfortably.
Noticing a trend of training at home gyms and playing golf to relax.
Raised the price to $75 after screwing us over with the ESPN subscription requirement? Nah
God of War is my favourite video game franchise, so it is really cool that there's a fighter repping it in the UFC.
Geez, figgy's so cringe without trying
Pays to be the bigger man I guess. You got the big guys playing golf and getting massages. While the little guys are busting their arses’ to cut and make weight.
Fig with that big ass water bottle🤣
I’m running with Brandon by UD. And Gane by tko or submission in round 4. Bold predictions but I feel it
Gane's style is bad for Francis tho
Is there anything Gane can’t do ✊
Francis really turned on his whole team that’s crazy I thought he was a good guy
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
1:58 craziest thing about this whole video lol
I think Figueiredo lost his last fight during his weight cut.  He made the weight but he had nothing left for the fight.  Let's see how this weight cut goes.
El cinturon
Mmm didn’t like that fatigue talk from the champ..
I swear every time Francis is on camera he gives another meme
Francis is the must relax killer of all time
Vamoss Brandon
The China woman got embedded by Francis lol
Brandon Moreno putting peanut butter on an apple ... 😉
Cyril is literally the chillest guy ever
Let’s go Gane !
Ma man is actually playing fifa 😭😭😭😭
Seen ciryl gane playing Fifa makes me want to play even more now
Deveison is going to loose, he just appeared two times doing his hair, in the countdown and in embedded, the curse is already on him
Impressed with the fifa ranking Bin Gamin. As impressive as the fight resume 🔥
Gane looks like a very simple guy. Not attached to the flash or fame.
I like this cyndaquil guy, seems chill
So many, so many of you all missed how deep the message at 7:00 was. I’m nobody father mentor nothing but bro enjoy life you might be so focused on something right now that you ain’t even check up on Mama, pops, aunty family etc. bottom line what I’m saying Cherish that shit. It’s One way In Life And One Way Out 🛣🕊.
Hopefully Ciryl fights better then he golfs .
6:08 when she give you that gawk gawk 3000
I like Moreno he got good energy
Wow I was just at the islands wish I would’ve known 😢
Ok, Gane is not small at all lol
Brandon’s English got better
Both these fights, I don’t know who to cheer for these 4 are all great humble warriors with good energy all the time
This camera guy really likes feet.
Ive never seen someone get off an assault bike and go straight into something else. Crazy fitness.
What are those ngannou feets
moreno wasent even sweating
Just to piss the UFC off big time it would be hilarious to see francis win then feck off to boxing
Gane🙏🏻🙏🏻👌🏻
We French always say '' putain '' , at least 20 times/day. so UFC embedded gonna bip him every 10 seconds !
1:40 assassin baby w the cartel music
Francis defo got a happy ending
I like Gane… seems like a great guy. I actually hope he does well but it only takes one from Francis
Figureido: and then I thought of the name "God of war"  Me: were you at gamestop by chance?
I lost some respect for Gane after seeing him wearing a face yamaka.
Cyril’s a joke? We’ll see about that
Branden ' You Know " moreno
9:27 they cut out the part with the happy ending.
I love both Cyril and Francis but I want Francis to win. Cyril will get his turn in 3 years time.
is moreno eating peanbutter and apple?
Guessing fig needs another humble sandwich after his beat down and still yapping lol clown
AND NEW CYRIL GANE
I like gane but hope it's another time. Ngganou is fighting to win for bigger changes that needs to happen in ANOTHER corrupt BUSINESS
How on earth did Cyril miss that tramp at 2:50 smh
Figueiredo using the Olaplex shampoo bet he cant lose now
Gane's Coach looks like Tom Segura ngl
Fuck, these guys are so fucking boring!  They literally put me to fucking sleep.  Woke up to the music at the end.  Think I'll watch the fight for free on youtube a couple minutes after the PPV.
8:15 those chemtrails tho
Figuerados over confidence is a big flaw.  Be alittle more humble to guy that# 1 is a gentlemen & #2 u have not beat when hes been murdering everyone.. "fighter of year "" etc..  The fight Gods hate that shit
Ummm…. These camera people really fucking love feet bro….
Saying Gane is a joke is a foolish thing to say. Like, if he is a joke, the fight is a joke so why should anybody tune in to watch?
Thickness spotted 5:34
Who else wants Gane to win?
Gane, seems like such a likeable dude!
Wait... are we all just gonna ignore that Moreno put nutella (or whatever that was) on an apple???
Ciryl playing Pro clubs 🤣🤣
It's crazy that both Francis and Ciryl are both great fighters and they both stack Bitcoin.
5:54 WTH!! I didn’t know Tom Segura had a side hustle working as Gane’s coach! 😂
Francis is a beast, lets go.
BON GAMAN
anyone know the name of the song francis is listening to during massage?
5:58
i would legit like to have a cold one with cyril and play some fifa. lad looks like he would be the absolute best chillest mate ever lol
3:20 when she won’t stop slurping
He said “ In the future I’m gonna be a girlfriend “  damn translator
"It's a heavy duty table because Francis is like 100 pounds"  Francis, the new flyweight champion.
Weakest card of the year......
Francis is looking leaner
You see those chem trails at 8:15
this embedded made me a fan of Gane
Francis getting a happy ending before sat lol
Francis clearly angry yet acting chill about it. That shit is scary.
9:35 omg this is tooi much  Gane is dangerous plz train hard  I cant see this frane as ufc champion 😫💔
9:18 😂😂😂
9:18 😂😂😂
Francis is gonna get f!$ked by the UFC and be made an example of . Off a loss. My prediction. He loses a decision. And leaves the UFC FOREVER ♾
rira bien qui rira le dernier
And...here....we...go!
Hes a joke that's going to pepper you from range and do what he wants with you
just 6:07, thats it
I can't guess Figueiredo's age within 30 years. He could be 24 or 54 it's so hard to tell..
Cyril Gane’s coach is Tom Segura
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Someone is getting their neck knelt on!!!!
Francis Is acting like he's John Jones and is undefeated and done 10 title defenses. Newsflash he hasent even defended it once. His ego is unbelievable   for never having defended his title yet.  I figured from where he came from he would be humble but it's exactly the opposite. Maybe the most egotistical of any champ I've seen yet. It's off-putting.
Francis with the best 🍑 in the game
Everyone’s had a fantastic camp until you get beat
Let's go moreno and n'gannou
Moreno listening to corridos while training 😈
Gane: we number 60 in the world Francis: hes a joke 🤣
The massage therapist should ask Francis for more money
Watch that whole video and they only interviewed Francis for about 30 seconds. What a joke. He's my favorite fighter I hope after he destroys Gane he leaves the UFC and is successful somewhere else.
Allez Ciryl  en est tous derrière toi !!!
I think people are hating and sleeping on Figgy unfairly.... This dude is a down to earth legendary human being
The editing at 5:17 is hilarious... "Ofcourse I'm a golfer" the throws it behind him somehow
Nous tous on falla le nyama🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲
Ciryl Gane going into this fight like it’s the morning & he’s going into Starbucks to get a quick coffee & bounce like it’s an ordinary day 🤣
"Its a heavy duty table because Francis is like 100 pounds" Francis vs Moreno next?
Did Brandon Moreno put some Nutella on his apple?? 👀😆
will there be a 4th moreno vs figgy fight in 2023 if fig wins? these 2 fight once a year and each other for the past 3 years
maaaaan why is gane so fn cool? i really have wanted ngannou to win  but gane is such a nice dude, hes been the exact same preufc till now
He said “he’s a joke”? Lol
Embedded is life
“It’s time for the real owner to have it” ??? Why fig acting like he didn’t get absolutely demolished in the rematch lol.
Gane chillin on fifa ready to take that belt 😂😂😂
Francis is going to win. We are Cameroonians. We always do. 🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲
ufc : foot fetish edition  This episode was directed by Dan Schneider 👣
9:17 lol
Francis gives off that final boss energy !
Cereal gane is getting captain crunched
We might have Gane and Moreno have a Lego, Fifa, and pizza party after their fights.
Is the cameraman in love with feet or what I’ve noticed this on embedded for years
Dana doing Ngannou dirty, gave him a 90 second segment in the entire episode. Smh
Damn he said he’s a joke
I think I'm putting my money on Gane
Both Gane and Nganou seem like nice ass monsters the fight game ia brutal im excited tho if Ganes foot work and defense is well in the first 2 rounds i see him having a high chance of winning unless he gets clipped
Andstill for both! 🔥🔥
I like how Moreno makes the most Mexican noise ever when he throws punches in training.
I love how everyone is training and recovering while gane is chilling playing his ps5 and golfing 😂
8:14, everything is fine, don't pay attention to it.
I don't understand the need for Figgy to get a rematch. Hopefully Moreno can beat him easily once again and we can move on.
I fuking love how everyone of these serious bones breaking fighters enjoy their daily dose of gaming.
I get the whole trash talking to sell a fight but it's hard to take anything DF says seriously when he was literally holding Brandon up and congratulating him after he got choked and now he's saying "the belt I lent you"? 🤦‍♂️
Sad thing is about these fighters going through all of this during their camp is that they don't get paid enough. Dana is a tightass
Gane deserve the belt than naganou
9:30  "I never cared about the interim title. it was a joke, still a joke" Did you Francis? which one is it?  haha this guy has always been a prick and I still do not understand how can people like him.
Brandon Morano’s breakfast is a questionable one
an, if the ufc would just admit they were cunts to mark hunt id definitely pay for the ppv this time!
Homie chillin with his biggest fight of his life 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Watching Ngannou sit up on that table; I'm sure some athletes at that weight are lean, but not many; it's just scary, for this sport, that a fighter at heavy weight looks like Ngannou does. If he fights Gane as calmly as he fought Stipe, I've no doubt that he wins that fight. Gane has more skills, is dangerous and could very well get his hand raised, but I think there's more motivation on Ngannou's end, in addition to a physical advantage; if Ngannou's mental game is on point, I dont see (m)any heavy weights beating him, even on the ground, however long he chooses to stay in the promotion.
6:10 that's such a French laugh 😆😆😆
Who is surreal gone?
3:20 this nigga laughing like Kaido 🐉
I like all theses fighters ,  Moreno is so much fun so much energy and happy . Cyril is so easy going - matches his technical skills.  Both speak English . Fig has the serious hungry look - I need to win to feed my kids.    The life Francis is having from homeless to a star . My verdict . Cyril and Brandon wins on points . You can’t hit me you can’t knock me out.
Fun Fact: Francis would’ve had a longer part. But this being his only title defense and him doing no promotion of his own he felt he wasn’t being paid enough.
Cryl is such a cool dude man
When are people going to realize the herny is train himself with other champions and not make them better but himself better for a fight dana will never give him
The camera men have a bad case of a foot fetish goddamn
More please! This card is insane
What's the code for Ngannou and her fine asian masseur? 😆
His neighbors must hate him for making all that noise!
If Francis really didn't care about the interim belt then he wouldn't even mention it.
Why the ufc keep filming figerierdos feet lol?
Not to be rude but gane is such a boring basic person man is like a manikin
Deiveison wins this week, God is with him
what a free dom to be 64 in the world. I bet he is red pill no wife or kids. I could have made fast judgment
Netflix: Are you still watching? Someone's daughter: 6:08
Thats actually crazy hes 64th in the world
Brandon Moreno knows his snack! Green apple and nutella what's up!
ICIIIIII C'EST PAAARIIIIIIIS !!!  BON GAMIN  !!!!
Gane playing video games makes me feel better when i play games now.. Lul. All balance though, not too much of anything folks.
Francis always have two other people present when your message therapist is messaging you. This way no false sexual harassment claims!!
9:17,  damn,  not only did Francis take stipes soul,   but he also took his "soles" aswell
just curious: why are they hitting golf balls into water? does someone go and clean them up?
Can’t wait to watch these fights on YouTube.
Hahahaha “I came up with the character God of war” These fighters and their egos.
I have a feeling that Moreno vs Davidson will be like Micky Ward Vs Gatti’s three amazing boxing matches that are legendary now.
He is not a joke. He came this far. If he was a joke. I would be a interim champ lol 😂
I’m convinced Moreno could go 8 rounds no problem.
Guys who you got francis or gane?
Francis gets about 2 minutes camera time right at the end
TWO GENTLE GIANTS  GOD BLESS 👍🏼💙
9:17 who's feet are those?
It's cool Ngannou is giving Gane some shit in the lead up to the fight - hypes it even more - but I hope they hug it out at the end, whoever wins.
If figueiredo will miss his chance winning the belt back, he must go up. Flyweight is sapping him, endurance will be his issue. A torture.
Ngl I'd be annoyed af having to train in the same gym as Moreno with all his little sound effects
Gane about to put on a clinic
I swear the embedded camera guys have some sort of foot fetish. Always making sure to get a shot with fighters feet as the focus
It will all lay in Gane’s hands. We know what Francis does best. Its how Gane will react to Francis strategy. Gane needs to be patient, keep distance in the early rounds and focus on the lead leg of Francis with leg kicks. That will decrease francis power and then he can fight like he always does
With the price hike… eh. Not a good enough card for me to spend dang near $80 for.
Sıfata bak
im so nervous for my boy brandon!!
Ngannou shitting on Gane sounded more like a praise. Such a gentle monster.
How can anyone say Francis is a nice guy. Gane hasn't said one bad word, but Francis has dismissed Ciryl and talked shit about him.  Figuereido embraced Brandon after their last fight and congratulated him. Now, he is talking trash?? 🙄   I hope Ciryl and Brandon win! Those are true nice guys!
6:05 Highest 'Chip' ever XD XD
francis with the at home happy endings
Gane's reaction at 5:21 reminds of mbappe surprised face meme
I like how the clip went from Moreno training his ass off to Gane showing his ranking in a game 😂
Does Francis message therapist give him tugs ? 😏
Can someone clarify why people keep saying that Francis is leaving the UFC when he very clearly seems to not be
i think the camera man this episode had a fetish for Deivesons feet
Aviero Djess Mola tu a encore briss
Good
Francis, you have been a great Champion. You are humbled and down to earth person. Somehow Cyril‘s success touches your nerve. Why? You should be happy as he is your brother. Don‘t underestimate or saying bad things about him - you are not that person! You are a great champion and remain like one. Please change your tone and show your class. Acknowledge Cyril and be professional. Otherwise you will lose the fight and get humbled. Please 🙏🏻
If I play Ciryl on fifa and lose you know his life’s getting threatened and then I’ll turn off my Xbox and go into hiding
Usando aquela VPN pra poder assistir kkkkkkk
I think Ngannou knocks out Cyril Gane in two or three rounds.
The best matchup is ngannou vs wilder.
the balls is Moreno eating with the green apple🤔🤔
Gane's friend looks like Tom Segura
Francis didn't perform good against Lewis. I think Cyril will win.
The rare ps5 shot
9:19  Even If Francis loose he could still have some success on onlyfans
Francis is fake asf.
Ya pay thousands of dollars to buy good cards
ngannou is fxxxxxxxxxed
Flyweights: training and cutting weight on Embedded Heavyweights: playing golf and Fifa
Gane has such a better personality than Ngannou.  Much more positive.
Love you Francis from india ❤️❤️
I'm cheering for Gane on this one even though I like Francis too
My guy Ciryl all chill playing FIFA like he won’t be fighting an absolute monster in Ngannou who can shut 99.9% of the populations lights off. 😂
Gane seems like the kind of guy who smoked weed and didn’t like it.
This is gonna be a very unfortunate co main and main event. I like Brandon and Figueiredo along with Francis and Cyril…
Cant wait to see Dana’s happy face when he wraps that belt around gene’s w
As good as gane is, ngannou is so physically powerful and athletic that i just don't see the technical pitter-patter working that well, not with ngannou being able to get gane off his feet with leg kicks and being able to put gane out if he ever ducks his head into one of ngannou's uppercuts
Nganu will take the biggest beating of his life
Benico has that demon yell. He’s going to be a killer
Was that green apple with peanut butter or what?ima try
Love the song (nyama), Francis playing in the background
2:56 bizarre choke right there
The only thing bigger then Ngannou is his tv setup.
Francis End-Gane-Ooh!!
man you can see the animosity towards francis from this video only a 1 and a half minute section for the heavyweight champion and that also at the end of the video
Francis has such a soothing voice. He should get into reading audiobooks as a 2nd career.  Did he call gane a joke?
Looks like figuredo got a cut on his eye. That's not gonna be good for fight night. Shit.
I think Gane is gonna win this one he’s the Jon Jones of the heavyweight division
I hope he quits ufc and goes to box fury which ofc no one would watch. He is a bullshit fighter, hope gane wins this.
🙏🇫🇷❤️
Oh la la is a real thing frenchies say???
Cant wait but the co main what a stupid fight
Gabi Garcia washing Davidson feguiredo head lol
Cannot wait for Gane to show Francis who is a joke! AND NEW
Although im rooting for Moreno , Figgy is such an interesting fighter. Not only is he a killer, his persona totally matches it too. This is probably my favorite rivalry in the UFC right now, im glad we still have this division.
Gane’s laugh when he hit the golf ball is priceless.
MAD Hype for this fight. 💯👊🏻   Who yall going for? Gane and Moreno Or Figueiredo and Ngannou 🙏🏻
Gane is playing proclubs? My man
Cyril is going to win... 🏆
Moreno and Davieson can fight 100 times, so entertaining and it’s gonna be a toss up every time. Respect
Francis and Gane are fighting for Baddest man on planet but both are Nicest men in the division, plus Figgy is getting more cringe.  I Hope Brandon wins this one also.
Ngannou Bomaye!!! Ngannou Bomaye!!!!
Wait did I just see someone eating freshly cut green apple with a chocolate spread? What world I'm in
Watching the heat up before the fight i really like both Gane and Ngannou. Both so calm and friendly, makes me wish they would team up and fight together :-D
Lmfao Francis feet look like a white mans feet .. shit whiter then mine hhahah
Francis  will won 100%, KO after 40 sec.
UFC not liking Francis.... What a ruthless, no backbone organisation is UFC... Like all big organisation... Apart from the fact that it's literally built in people's blood
Francis the new WOODLEY CRY CRY CRY
Camera man got a foot fetish
Let’s go Gane and Moreno !!!
Massage lady has happy ending written all over her t-shirt.
The joke will be on Francis if he loses
I guess if Francis got the happy ending?
I’m done doubting moreno. It will be the same outcome.
Figueredo is trying so much to act like the tough guy... and then my guy, the leggo collector, ruins him... : D
And the new
Damn, is Gane even bad at anything? He already said he was good at football and basketball and even his sales job and now he shows us that he is also a high rank fifa player.
Gane will win this and just a gut feeling as well I’m picking Figgy
Man this is going to be a tough fight to watch. I like both Gane and Ngganou and watching them rise to the top was amazing.
Having a masseuse of opposite sex is a recipe for adultery bro. you should get a male one.
Where can i get a "Bon Gamin" T-Shirt? Anyone knows??? O_O
Lol Cirycl Gane is a gamer.  Now I can relate to him 😂
c'est bien montre ton arrogance francis samedi tu pleure
Francis has a bad attitude.
Only episode 1… but approx ~40 sec of the champ Ngannou, and at the end? He’s the draw for this ppv.
As much as I think Ganes gonna win. Im mentally and emotionally not ready to watch him possibly get sparked unconscious
Either Cyril beats him on the score card or Francis knocks him out in the second. Excited for this card
That director has a foot fetish...
'cyril is like a computer. he gathers data, finds your speed, your movements and then picks you apart' - fernand
Francis's voice is so relaxing like the angel's siren song but it's a 6'3 117 pounds beast
FRANCIIIIIIIS. Repping the homeland even in Las Vegas. The name of the song is le nyama by aveiro djess if anyone wants to know
3:38- take that shit off your face mate! clown!
Moreno is such a cool dude.
hope Moreno defends his title
Gane to knock him out
NEYMAR
Apple and peanut butter?? What!!??
Figueiredos brain must be short on air after getting choked out to loss the title as he thinks he lost by decision and gave the belt to Moreno XD
fabulous stuff .. !
Lets go ciryl 👍
8:15 some artificial clouds
Davidson is still asleep lmao
Ngannou is 5% French with his white feet
I'm sure Brandon's neighbors love the yelling
figgy look and sound drained
Gane - The Good Guys' Champion
« Pass the ball. I haven’t touch it once since the camera’s been there filming guys » 😂😂
As a guy from Paris, it's sad to see this event happening on the other side of the world. Enjoy it for us, may the best man win.
Cryl vs Francis draw
tom segura speaks french too?!
No one speaks English on this card 😂
If Deiveson wins  that means we getting  Deiveson vs Moreno 4
Main event will end in a split draw. Guaranteed!!
Dang this ppv is gonna flop
I love Francis Ngannou and Cyril Gane, 50-50 I give a bit to Francis just because he's the champ. May the best fighter win. (Those fifa skills give Gane extra points XD)  My Spanish heart goes with Moreno, I hope the saviors of flyweight division (Moreno and Figueredo) give us a great fight like the two Before they have.
Its the who gives a shit fight card
i just have this sneaking feeling that figueredo is gonna win by ko this time. love moreno but idk i think thats the most likely outcome
Anyone know that song Francis played before he got a massage?🔥
Cyril gane reminds me of my dad who went out to buy milk
Fifa22 still has that server sign showing on your online match? Thats so cheap. How is it possible in the year 2022, to still have server issue?? So cheap and amateurish. From a big football game.
One the most exciting HW match ups we’ve had in a while! I’m routing for the Cameroonian destroyer 😬
After watching this video, im sure Gane will lose
Some one remind me why Dieveson got a rematch  ?
I think Ngannou is going to win. But Ngannou have to respect his opponent. He isnt a joker. Gane is the real deal.
Dont worry Francis, everyone thinks the interim title is a joke except the UFC
6’5 UFC Heavyweight phenom Ciyrl Gane, is a pro clubs sweat lmao
Nasıl götürdü kemeri ama  bu arkadaşda sarmaş dolaş dövüşmeyi seviyo : )))))) Şu Meksikalı arkadaş.
6:08 when she gives you that slop top all of a sudden.
Man Francis has some white feet
9:19 Francis got some French bread loafs as feet lol
I want moreno to humble him again, this guy talks to much for a draw and a submission
Going for Francis and Moreno, let’s go champs!
We're so lucky to have such wonderful representatives at the top of our sport
sheesh
All four of them can be nice and scary at the same time 😂❤️
I believe Gane is gonna school Ngannou. It's gonna be like Adesanya vs Costa.
Francis. First trash talk ever ...I know his a joke, his still a joke
He talking bout his belt when he lost twice
Gane TKO 4th round
Wtf is Figgy talking about ? He lent Moreno the belt ? 😂 that man choked the life out of you & made you submit. Check the scoreboard Figgy , you’re down.
Is Figueredo actually diluded or something he lent the belt to Moreno come on man u wore lucky to get a draw In the first fight and the second one was as convincing a win as he cud of been it will be a good fight but In my opinion Moreno gets the job done again
Gane is such a free minded guy ❤️😊 He’s robbing on me slowly.
Rust and the G in da zone. Big up la sueur
Did I really see that guy eat an apple with peanut butter???
Can’t wait ! Let’s go Cyril
Gane join our pro clubs team
When figgy said that he would take back the belt he lent to Moreno, I'm like WTF, that dude got choked .
Ahh fuck Apple and peanut butter not for me
Figgy looks drained as fuck
both champions gonna lose
They should make these atleast 20 minutes.
LFG
i just get a feeling that this year will be the year of most derailed hyped train !!
Gane tkos people Nganou sends them to Heaven
Allez Cyril, récupère la ceinture de cet opportuniste de Ngannou ! Tout ce qu’il sait faire c’est bouffer à tous les râteliers.
Moreno and Gane are the best people in the whole UFC roster
Cyril Gane aside, I think I love Mexican MMA now
How do they fish out golf balls ?
dude
FOOT FETISH CAMERA GUY IS BACK - DAMN HE LOVES FIGUEIREDO'S FEET
If nganou loss,khabib will never take him and bring to eagle fc..coz in eagle fc all fighter dont have bad sheet...all of them zero losses...
Figgy saying the weight is great🤣 Heard that before🤧🤧🤧
apples and chocolate spread !!! thats his secret wtf!! hahaha
9:16 What are thoose :D
I wouldn´t want to win a FIFA match against CIRYL.
I predict, this will be one of the lowest paper view's in UFC history. I knew this would happen to the UFC. Out price the fans that made the sport! Unbelievable..🤦🏼‍♂️
Moreno and Gane what amazing characters.
i love Moreno but i wanna see Figgy back at champ. he’s like one of the cool villains🤣
9:17 what an angle :D
People getting theyr fifa rankings on ufc embedded who would of thought
Ganes taking wonderboys title for the nicest guy and gane is one scary guy at the same time
It wud Hilarious if Figgi miss weight and fights for nothing. 😆
Man figgy looks very uncertain
0:08 You Might think The Toys are for the Kids, But These were Brandon's Toys
No way cyril said a bad word
Picturesque chemtrails lol @ 8.17
Francis looks very relaxed. Good. 🙂
I like Francis but Cyril is the elite of the elite
Wow good luck Guys ,awesome Card,nice to see u Francis 👍👍👊👊🙂
Am I the only one who thought the Ben guy was Jon Anik?
Francis is a living "blacked" meme but is so kind he doesn't even notice
The fact that moreno is even giving him a rematch is amazing. He could have just walked off with the belt
Moreno and Gane will both win by submission
Et  sinon bon courage Cyril moi je vais aller avec Francis et sinon je te souhaite bonne chance Cyril 😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇.
Francis is a capitalist pig! He’s a really bad person don’t you know?
ils en beau etre gentil a 50 ans ils sont foutu a force de prendre des coups
This is going to be hard to root against anyone. I really like both Moreno and Figuredo… also I really like Gane and Ngannou 😕
Gane beats ngannou in the second round
Jesus does Francis look big...
I think the most boring embedded ever...
So grateful to still be alive in 2022 to see this epic fight!
Figgy's really proud of that one 4:25 lmao
Moreno just casually spreading penut butter on an apple, must be an american thing
Gane and Moreno for the win easy money 💰
We are either going to witness a brutal knockout within the 1st 2 rounds by Ngannou or a 5 round clinic and possible late 4th or 5th round finish by Gane.
Didnt know Gane played fifa
Gane’s coach couldn’t look more like Tom Segura 6:10
Moreno is very likeable and at the same a killer in that octagon! Vamos champeon
Well i hope you don't get beat by a joke
que los dios de Azteca le quema la corazon de Triple C por tratando en no apohrar  los Mexicanos y  la corrason a brandon Moreno
too manny fkn ads
Imagine gane slept ngannnou
Francis getting a massage giving me blacked vibes
So Fig is just a polytheist pagan, k
3:15 'se démarquer'= 'to free oneself from marking' in this context. :)
People that win the rematch win the trilogy much more times
Figuereido cuts too much weight Brandon Moreno makes that cut easily
Biden must want ngannou to lose, look at the size of those chemtrails above his house! 8:15
Francis trying to hide the pressure but I can feel it's there on the back of his mind. Rooting for Cyril to get the job done.
Fuck man, I dont know who to root for, Francis or Gane?
Was that nutella on an apple? Intrigued. Breakfast of Champions.
A joke ? Gane will win boy
Ngannou looks smaller and leaner this time around. Potentially more cardio for him while hopefully keeping that insane power.
IT'S TIMMMEEEE! First PPV of the Year!! 🔥
Assassin baby said "ey eyyy ey ey eeyy!
Fancy seeing U fellow ufc fans here lesgoooooooo!
Disliked just to be FIRST!
05:32 Didn't know Tom Segura was Gane's coach!
Bold words there, "He's a joke".Gane is as skilled as they come !
long live assassin baby
Let's go, Brandon! 👌
Great...all guys who cant speak english well
moreno wins by UD and francis wins by ko in round 3 u heard it here first
Make the episodes longer!
Cyril is making Francis WREAK of insecurity. Sure, the Interim Belt is somewhat of a joke, but the guy holding it in this case is the exact opposite of a joke. I dont know who the hell Francis is trying to fool. I guess he's doing what he has to do to be mentally where he needs to be, but denial can be a very dangerous thing, and if he's going to bed at night telling himself "No way is Gane the fastest, best footwork having, undefeated savage heavyweight" than boy, he might just be in trouble.
Feels like figgy vs Moreno 3 would whole lotta different ?!!
02:55 that was a terrible passing decision, there were 2 players to his right who would've scored the goal relatively easier
Gane is building that hand eye playing Fifa.
6:08 thats what she said 😉
Cyril, francis, Brandon, figgy. All the nicest people you’re likely to get killed by if you try.
Best of luck Charlie Puth and Francis Ngannou.
goddamn brandon looks big up
For American dudes pro clubs is the mode in FIFA football/soccer where you play online and only control one specific created player. I'm sure NBA or NHL, NFL games have the same type of mode
Gane is a super chilled guy positive vibes
Wow I didn't know Tom Segura was coaching Ciryl Gane 😅
Moreno looks shit, but he worked out with Canelo, so fuck it
Can't wait to see Cyril golfing with DC
They censored the “putain”
Moreno one more tym 👊👊👊
"Yesterday is history, tomorrow a mystery and today is a gift. That's why we call it the present." - Michael Chandler
Even as a ufc champ you still dealing with shitty hotel WiFi lol
Francis Voice Sounds like a Killer in a Movie  Friendly But dangerous
Nganu win .3d round tko
Francis: *trains 6 days a week Ciryl: *plays FIFA 6 days a week
Pay your fighters dana
This fight is a repeat of the rumble in the jungle
“I knew he was a joke and he’s still a joke” damn Francis firing shots!!
Figgy was a barber before joining the UFC. Give him some respect.
Feels good to have UFC embedded back!
8:18 nice chemtrails!
Moreno and still, Gane and new!
Il est trop drôle ce mec 😂(Ciryl Gane)
Moreno working his Lil ass off in training camp... Next Cyril gane playing Fifa and having the time of his life 😂. Man I love the UFC
"I knew he was a joke and he is still a joke" - Francis
imagine some nerdy teenager starts trash talking gane on fifa without knowing he could literally kill everyone on the planet in a fight
Idk what it is about figueiredo but I’m mot a fan.
Ciryl knows deep down he,s gonna f**k francies up that's why he,s just chilling like a villain
Tom segura is friends with so many people.
Like Gane a lot more than Ngannou but kinda want Ngannou to win. I can’t ever root against a fighter who publically advocates for more money.
Figueredos phone case is awesome
When Cyril says he will menage this ya gotta believe him....Francis by KO.
Did Francis call Gane a joke?
Am I the only one that felt it was weird for them to show the bottom of Francis foot ?
Did Francis got the happy ending or what ?
Big respect to Ngannou Massage therapeut, how can she manage a body like that
Nice to see branden
francis got the happy ending
Game vs Cormier 🏌️
Ngannou thinks Gane is a joke but if he doesn't get that knockout he will have a hard time winning.
Francis going to catch it.
Cyril Gane has the biggest cranium in the UFC, I somehow think that helps him against Frnacis
So what's the point of those big ass cameras if you're not gonna upload the vids in 4k...
Figgy's looking sluggish. No idea how that guy makes 25
2:38 what dana says to conor every friday night
nice to know Francis is taking Ciryl as a joke LOL. whoever has money on Francis cash out now.
These brazilians have something with dying their hair 😂
Everyone's training while Ciryl playing video games and golf aha, long life Bon Gamin !
Can’t stand to hear someone speaking in foreign languages…
I was like *okey*
Francis is like the most soft spoken giant ever!
You need to be Lewis at least to be Francis massage therapist.
HOLY SHIT Gane's fifa ranking is insane. He plays A LOT and has been over many years I can tell
There is only one question:Is Gane ready to nullify Ngannou,or not YET.
So Gane is just amazing at everything?
Man I'm so excited about the main event can't fookin wait.
Ganes pro club is shite
My dawg Francis 🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲💯💯
His coach at the golf range looks like Tom Segura
Y’all ever see a relatively new ufc stars in big houses and your just like “ man I hope you keep winning becuase the bills will keep comming.”😂
1:37 J Balvin:"Let's make music together ese"
AJ is fighting too soon after his loss
Lots of subtitles in this episode
cant wait to witness a murder on saturday night
Ciryl gane is gonna smesh francis mark my words💪
Francis always talking like he's in a library or somethin 💤
B
I don't think there's any real bad blood between Gane & Ngannou. They've been thoroughly respectful towards each other; and yes the interim title belt in this instance is a joke.
Figuereido showing again why fighting is so hard, being away from your family. A birthday even, best wishes to all these men. Competitive cards.
Lmfaoo Moreno out here living in a mansion.
Hopefully francis and Moreno win
UFC VS Top Boxers Dream Card  Ngannou Vs Fury Jon Jones Vs Wilder  Ciryl Gane Vs Anthony Joshua  Stipe Vs Usyk
WHY TF YALL GIVE MY GUY FRANCIS ANY SCREEN TIME THIS IS BS BRO
Francis if fighting, wut?
I hate this fucking matchup..someone is going to loose damn it..same situation happend during Stipe match..
Moreno looks good
I got a PS5 just like Ciryl Gane.
You know I know Francis is Francis and he does have that power but Ciryl def ain’t no joke bruh. He may make Francis look bad.
4:30 still playing heel
What’s the headset Gane using?
Dude around here playing golf like Francis a joke, Francis knock his ass out
Brandon getting a UFC lego set is whole some.
I absolutely love listening to Ngannou. He has the kindest, most genuine soul and a soothing voice. He could talk me into being his sparring partner in 2 seconds
When Ciryl said he is always focused on his mission, is he referring to FIFA?
Ciryl gane is the type of guy to beat Francis and give him his belt back because he so nice
ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP I Subscribed to you Channel and I Press 🔔Bell Button and i Joined the Notifications Squad to and I Follows you on Instagram & Facebook &TIKTOK  to
Everyone: fighting at ufc 270: Training hard cutting weight  Gane: playing Fifa and golfing
0:14 Yes it is, and you are! PSYCHED!!! ok carry on...
Figgy must start cutting weight now before its too late!
I have moreno and Gane winning curious what everyone else has
Both the Francis v gane fight and Moreno v figuredo fight are soo hard to call, both literally the case of who shows up on the night
Top 65 and they miss that 3v1??? my guy 😮‍💨😂 gane and moreno to the top 🙏🏾
Francis finna get humbled
If Figgy wins then that will mean him and Mareno fight a 4th time to sort it all out
The translator getting a big paycheck on media day!!
Someone needs to mix this audio better, Francis’ voice almost blew my iPhone speakers
If fig wins their needs to go to a 4 fight If Brandon wins  id like to see fig vs france
Great chemtrails!!
wtf was this embedded? I just watched a dude play fifa on PlayStation in a hotel and dude get a massage.....  Wow... killers in there....
Francis is Foooked
Fransis "100 n sth pounds" Ngannou!!!
Francis and Still Figueiredo will be champ again
man what's up with this weird foot fetish that the embedded editors have... stop that bs man pleaase
8:14 what a fuck is that shit on the sky?
Ngannou's head is shaped like a tiger, so is his nose
Hoping Gane takes the Undisputed Belt. I am a fan of Ngannou but since he won the belt something changed with him, can't put my finger on it but something changed
me sorry for bad english. does massage therpist = prostitute?
Moreno is worried about getting better, Figgy is worried about weight. Gimme Moreno
I knew he was a joke, and he's still a joke. Really? If this goes past 2 rounds he's the heavyweight champ and I don't even count him out ending you early. Good luck with that not working for $500,000 a fight after this.
9:35 so disrespectful of Frances to say about Ciryal i hop Ciryal ko him      Gane seems very calm and collective and that is what makes him very dangerous fighter !! you can not get under the skin of that guy !! he is so focused !! what a fighter !!
That was lame and boring
The last time we see Francis get ready...
Youtube and there ads are so annoying
If Francis competes in bodybuilding I think he would do very well.  I swear This man is carved out of stone while being natural.  One of a kind athlete.
Why is gabi Garcia cutting figgys hair?
I'am rooting for Ngannou but Gane is cool but can't stand his Coach. Predicting KO 1st RD for Ngannou.
0:15 😰😰😰😰 i never ate an apple like that
Green apple already gross. Green apple + Peanut Butter Jam, holy fk I can't
🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
Parlay on the challengers.
The 2 deadliest guys on the planet are fighting and one has the softest voice and the other has the funniest laugh
I hope Francis continues his reign
damn that little asian lady has to go through all that fascia and muscle on Francis. Must be tiring as shit.
I think Deiveson is actually just a chill guy who gets personified and paraphrased by Walid
The UFC kicks off the year with a biggest, baddest fight.
flyweights: cutting weight and goin hard in on the mats. Heavyweights: playing fifa with the boys. Golfing. Getting massage.
Figueiredo: I trained to kill.   Also Figueiredo: I like dyeing my hair and travel with the color ready.   Gotta love it.  👊🏽💇🏼‍♀️☺️
Didn’t realize Tom Segura is Gane’s coach
Let’s go assassin baby!!!!
Ciryl “Venice bitch” Gane. Gonna be a banger on Saturday!
All the best. The harder you train, the less likely it is you get hit in the face. Remember it is 80 percent mind, 20 percent body. @UFC - Ultimate Fighting Championship Slice him up, Gane.
"All I got to say, there gonna be some more black on black crime."  -Rampage Jackson
FIFA 22 Pro Clubs @Sidemen x Top BoyZ? Come on lads, you can make it happen!
Battle
Equal
Those Two
Gane for the win !!!!!!
Crazy battle coming up
Clearly fig has never heard of the barbers curse
Gane will win
Seeing those cardio machines and NOCCO drinks in Francis’ kitchen makes me think he’s gonna have a decent gas tank.
Francis about to show everyone why he's the scariest heavyweight ever.
skip to 8:14 for the Chem trail shot we were all waiting for.
One hit wonder:" i knew he was a joke and he is still a joke" keep that energy in the post fight presser after Gane wins
Francis can't promote a fight
we have spanish, french and portuguese. i learned a lot from this video lol
Moreno: Working his ass off Figueiredo: Training and making huge sacrifices   Gane: I think I’ll play fifa Ngannou: I want a massage!
The only thing Cyril Gane cannot do is nothing😅
Figueiredo didnt deserve this rematch🤦🏻‍♂️ Brandon controlled and dominated the last fight and left no question about whos champion
Damn Francis be getting that happy ending every camp 🥶
Cyril needs clubs made for his height
Petition to bring Michael Chandler in every Embedded
I still say Deebo went to France roughly 31 years ago...:)
“ Calm Francis is a Scary Francis “ Yes Sir
9:18 is that francis foot 😆
I just realized, Figi Does the Red Stripe literally as a reference to the video game “ God of War “   That’s actually high key cool af. Didn’t know he knew that world
Figueirdo is crazy. You didn’t lend him the belt. Brandon strangled you and took the belt home lol.
Gane by TKO of the very 1st Round 💪🏼
Gane is a gamer? His chances of winning just skyrocketed
Tom Segura coaches Gane? WUT
I had no idea Moreno's English was that good.
Cannabis can block covi, Smoke weed everyday 🌲🌳🌴
y’all hear the same thing as me at 6:08
Francis voice is so relaxing 😌
Ciryl just chilling in the hotel room ripping ultimate team packs
I have nothing against Francis but it kills how much one good sprawl against a stipe gave him so much hype.. he’s a scarier looking Derrick Lewis gane Schools him
Did Francis just said Gane was a joke ?
I miss Anaheim!!!!!! 🥲
That moment where he talks to his son in the dinosaur costume really got to me. You always want to be around for your kid but sacrifices must be made for a better future.
And Still🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲👑🏆
This is just great Gane and Moreno are just so likeable, je prie pour qu'ils soient tous les deux victorieux. 🇫🇷
Francis needs to shut up and fight. Hard to feel sorry for someone who hasnt fought since winning the belt almost two years ago.   You have guys like Moreno who've only won their belt a few months ago and already fighting this weekend.
mohajed 6:08 that ciryl gane's doorbell
Gane is such a nice guy you could never hate him
I feel like Brandon and Ciryl together would make a great interview
Moreno is such a cool dude
Francis loves massage. All his embedded massages 💆‍♀️ 🙌 😍 😌 👌 ✨
Cyrils mates not passing him the ball on fifa for the camera
That french laugh @6:11 was diabolical
Im french and honestly cyril is almost as trash in the french language then in english wtf honestly
Hold up.... Green Apple with Peanut Butter?
Who else tryna peep Francis' massage therapist knockers?
Pat Barry is the type of guy to be the husband and corner man of Rose while fighting for the heavyweight championship 🤯😀
Cyril is possibly the calmest fifa player I've ever seen, I would've lost my head at 2:55 if I was him
Francis made white feet 🦶🏻🦶🏻(on that table massage) So why can’t I do a black face??  🤷🏾‍♂️
Stay humble Francis.
No heels here all baby faces in the main event
Woah,when did Gabby Garcia buy a salon!!
I love cyril but there is no chance to win against nganou i mean look at him. Thats the ufc promoting and supporting the new guy in the division, they know nganou is on his last fight and wont sign again probably and they try to bring the new guy on the spotlight that they can say hey look he leaves us but we have still this other guy gane. And thats it! Ufc is getting more and more shady
6:09 WTF was that.. New content for Mojahed
FIFA? People play that game?
Peanut butter with apple?😂😂wtf
I'm still rooting for moreno he deserves the belt more than anyone!!
Man I still can't find a ps5 in the wild.. bonkers bruh
Nganou will sleep cyril, he just looks more ridgid and he can move too. Stipe fight was insane. If Nganou comes out the spinner punches from death like he did against rozenstruck its a wrap.
gane jus like us fr 😭
Francis by 1st round vicious ko
Did Brandon just put Nutella on his apple?? 😂😂 the man is as innocent as a baby lol it’s cute in a childish way. But seriously? Nutella with apple? Bananas? Definitely. Strawberry? Maybe. Apple? That’s wild.
Champions of UFC need to atleast make a million dollars. Shame that smaller orgs champs get 1 million
smh these fighters should have had there own YouTubes and monetized it there self  ... another Revenue stream 4 Dana White he's getting paid at least lol.
Francis got that happy ending forsure
I like figgy he’s cool. moreno gonna mop him tho
Feels like Figueiredo has problems with weight cut again
Moreno & Ngannou
AY HEE AY HEE AY AY HEE 1:37
Biggest white feet bottoms i have ever seen
Man, these UFC posters these days have been pretty lame. Show some creativity in the posters @UFC
Dang I miss this one
Cyril ain't no joke big man!
idk how exactly it happened but im rooting for Gane!
Francis is going to visualize Dana's face over Gane's when he's punching him this Saturday.
Lmao Cyril Gane casually being 64th in the World on FIFA Club Pro
5:45 Lmao
I like Figgy, but let’s go Brandon!
Gane looks too comfortable, it’s just one video but let’s see I guess.
Ngannou is getting tko, sad but true
Ngannous gonna get battered and then blackballed. Dont bite the hand that feeds you
Win or lose there better not be a fourth fight between Moreno and Figueiredo
INNA TRACKHAWK JEEP ITS NOT CHEAP ITS A SR….HUH? IN A TRACKHAWK JEEP THIS A SRTTTT 😮‍💨
Gane is 64 in the world at fifa!?!! Damn son
GANE IN UD
Gane gonna finesse past Le Predator.
Mixing apples with coffee and all that shit...I guess that's how he cuts weight
Dana hoping to send Francis back to the sand mines.
Shoutout Moreno for giving his training partner some shine there it’s easy to forget about some of the undercard fighters but they deserve press as well not all the attention should be on the co/main event fighters
French people always sound like they have food in their mouth
Moreno gonna take Figgy cheeks. Trust that
I bet Brandon’s neighbors are like wtf….but never complain.
Bro Im a fan of all four of them, so ready for the weekend, they are amazing fighters !!!🔥
Figueiredo will lose again. Hopefully after that the UFC releases him.
La candela
Figgy still writing that false narrative of Moreno just to be motivated .. Moreno by Knockout 👌
This is a great fight card.
Gane losing I know because video games put you down when you lose
Netflix: Are you still watching?  Somebody’s Daughter: 6:09
who fckin puts peanut butter on apple lol
The videography is always amazing on these UFC vlogs
Here we fucking GO!!!
Gane will win vs ngannou 💪👊☮️😉🤔👑👍🙏
Deiveson has a controller on his phone! Wonder what he plays?
Love how Brandon gives his boy camera time at the beginning “This guy is fighting at ufc 270 also”  *walks away while camera stays on his boy Love this guy.
Cyril Gane looks and sounds like I'd expect Shrek to sound like if her were 6'4 240 and French
& Gane
Let's go Brandon Moreno!!
Gane is fast strong and very agile. That being said Ngannou by first round KO
Moreno is such a genuine person. Love his attitude.
Lets goo moreno. The come Saturday at the anaheim arena im literally a 5 min drive away from the place i couldnt get tickets sold out but man its going ti be amazing . Same here guys I dont want either of those 2 to lose. Francis or gane theyre both cool asf ppl. And thrill and the agony episode will great in the aftermath once the dust settles
he posted his sn right there. i played him on FIFAA lol. hes ok, but i won. SORRY CIRYL BUT I GOT YOU HAHAHAHA
Cyril Gane reminds me of Andre The Giant
Pes its Easy. Try fifa 22 much better
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I like how they show everyone getting ready for the fight and Gane just chilling lol
Figueiredo already looks drained lol.. I think the fight gets canceled
Moreno looking punch drunk, look how dudes holding the apple…always thought there was something up with him.
I gave the first fight to Moreno,but this is a great match up. I would watch these 2 warriors fight over and over without losing interest
BON GAMIN 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
I bet Francis had a happy ending :P
A UFC Champion should have a bigger house than that man… increasing ppv prices but not gonna pay them more? Pretty sad. Don’t delete my comment now
“How tough can he be with a name like Francis”
I really really hope Francis and the UFC can work a good contract out. Hate to see him walk
Can someone pls let Cyril know that he has a fight this Saturday???
Sorry Fig that belt isn't going back to Brazil with you.
Ngannou
Ngannou will surprise a lot of people again.
Old saying in Pakistan  Lowa ko lowa kat tha hey  Meaning to this in English is  Metal cuts metal  He trained in the same gym and had the same trainer at one point so he will already be aware of fransis strong points and week points
Brandon looks like the small brother of Juan Manuel Marquez. And LOL UFC took advantage of his lego collection.
I honestly didn't know black peoples bottom of the  feet are white 🤯
Ngannou the real champ!
Moreno all dayy🇲🇽
I can't stand Moreno's little bitch boy noises when he punches lmao
Cyril has Tom Segura on his team, i never noticed that.  cool
i feel like the embeddeds can be 20min long. 10min is too short
Its always crazy to see how nice they are then in the octagon just MEAN.
Francis needs to humble himself. Or his reign won't last long
1-1 versus stipe and calling Ciryls title a joke hahaha.
My boy Tom Segura at 5:53
It’s gonna be hard to see Cyril get ko’d his a really cool guy
I'm surprised the UFC even included Francis in the embedded as much as they hate guys asking to be paid what they deserve. But their hate shows in the fact they gave him less than half the time they gave anyone else. Fuck you Dana. Pay the man.
Guys the video from here 3:59 to here 4:59 has issues, so you just skip that part...
Let’s go champ you got this do it for TJ
Israelites watching Moses split the sea: 3:17
Assassin baby has that gremlin’s number. Let’s go Brandon!!! 😂
Gane English coming together even better now. Good for him! Always big respect for guys who put effort into learning the language of the country that has given them these incredible opportunities. Soooo stoked for Saturday!
Brandon Moreno's just a good dude    Fig don't deserve rematch. Change my mind?😎
It’s interesting that most ufc fighters are kind of introverted gamers on their down time.
Alistair gonna get schooled if that spar footage was anything to go by
Brendan I like you but f you I don’t want to see your shit rematch with that guy would have liked to see someone else get a shot
IDK I LIKE GANE IN THIS ONE. GANE IS MORE ATHLETIC PERIOD.
Moreno is a walking W
Figgy "i train to kill" my self. 🤣
“I’m always focused on my mission” *while playing fifa*😂😂
Franci’s ego getting to him lol Looking past Gane and callimg him a joke is crazy when his problem not even with Gane, its his former coach lmao Gane with a 4th rd triangle choke
Feeling confident for Gane as the massage therapist let slip that Francis weighs only 100lbs
Gane finna rock ngannou nd moreno keepin his title
6:08 Mojahed going to have fun with this
5:33 i thought that was tom segura for a sec lol
I can only imagine that massage lady was like "Damn this man is built like a God, what even are these muscles i've never seen that before"
Can’t wait to stream this mf on Saturday 🙌
peanut butter n apple...its normal adperson Silva voice
What's the chances we see Francis try for takedowns? I think that be a good gameplan if the opportunity presents itself.
Playing video games...lol. He's so relaxed....he knows the NEW!
Arrogance does not suit Francis, don't know why he has to push it, he's respected already as it is
When did Francis decide to be such a dck?
And Still And New
I'll be impressed if Deiveson can just make weight easily. I think that's his biggest hurdle coming into the fight. Last time was brutal I didn't think he would return to the division
Let's go God.of war and Cyrial
Has to be the worst embedded Iv ever seen 👎🏻
Gane 👑👑
Dármela dice gane 🤣🤣🤣🤣
figueiredo is going to lose and then pull out the excuse book again
Can't stand Portuguese language
I wanna see Francis VS Wilder so freaking bad!!
Justin Gaethje sees quit in Gane's golf game
I'm sure the neighbors don't mind Moreno yelling as he trains with the garage door open.
Happy Ending?
Brandon training while listening to corridos is absolutely amazing
If it goes passed 3rd round, I got Cyril. If it’s under 3 it’s Francis fight.
Both fights are nearly impossible to predict because of how good all four are, but I’m predicting Gane by TKO, Moreno by TKO. I would never bet money on this. BTW Gane has a PS5.
:o my man Ciryl plays Pro Clubs wow
Love Francis Ngannou and Ciryl Gane! May the best man win.  Deiveson Figueiredo will get his Belt back! Let's go Champ!
Moreno is good at screaming but he's going to lose bad
9:09 nip slip
I’m 140 pound soakin wet. I can DEFINITELY beat Cyril     in FIFA 😝
this fight is going to be incredible!
Win or lose it’ll be sad for the  heavyweight division if Francis leaves after this fight  PS: Moreno makes some loud ass groans lmao
There will be some big upsets
Figgy is actually a very likeable guy
Apple & peanut butter?
Cyril should of been on UFC4 on top of Francis ground pounding him. Missed moment 😂
Sometimes the nicest guys are the scariest ones
He either wins and has one more fight on the contract and if he wins again still has another fight added so Francis is just gonna let Gane win so he can head straight to boxing. Francis can always return and he should leave, he's almost beat everyone and return in 2 years the division will look different. Bet all your money on Gane.
this made me like Gane a lot more lmao
Francs isn't focused, he's going to get knocked out.  watch
Asian massage therapist not wearing a bra looking for that extra tip
I fucking love you Dana white and you change my life
Francis becareful... Becareful!!
Let's go
petition to get cyril some better wifi 🗣️
Definitely rooting against Gane, dude has a POS5. Yank.
$4bn company and champions and fighters are training out of garages and hotel rooms.... Fuck Dana
Let's go Francis.
Part of me thinks Cyril is to technical and will win, Francis has alot of distractions too. But when you have a guy with that kind of one shot power he only has to be on for a split second and the fights over. Either way I'm excited to watch this one.
The Thrill and Agony gonna be something lol
Ganes looks heavier... Or I need a gynaecologist
Lets go assassin baby and cyril.
peanut butter on apples. is that what it takes to be a champ?
I never knew Tom Segura was Ciryl Gane's coach
Venice beach was not beautiful. Stop It
Did Ngannou just call Gane a joke ? So much arrogance.
The Predator 💪🏿
Gane is very good
francis gonna regret calling him a joke when he gets his ass handed to him on a platter
8:14 that sky 😜
stoked!!
Ciryl Gane has a great golf swing
Anyone else imagine the cameraman butt-naked in the sauna with Figueiredo?
The cameraman appears to be obsessed with Figuierido's feet
I wanna play Gane on pro clubs
Deiveson talking like he didn’t tap out lol
All Francis  needs is one punch 🤛🏽
This is gonna be action not like when he vs Lewis 🤣🤣
And we're baaackkkkkkkkk
Idk Gane being ranked 64th in the world in FIFA may be more impressive than him winning the belt 🤷‍♂️
Shoutout Moreno for having his training partners living with him
Gane plays pro clubs for a club ranked 64th in the world, that’s class😂 I play pro clubs religiously and we’re only ranked 876th
Lmfao 6:08 it sounds like someone is spraying a windex bottle 😂
Did they fire the person who did subtitles? They were invaluable.
Here for the culture 🔥 let's get it
은가누 1라운드 ko승
Gane rocking the 97's. keep finding more reasons to like this man
Gayne gonna whoop this dudes ass!!!!!!
Cyril over here with Tom Segura as a coach 🤔
Ngannou is about to get out classed

Is anybody else getting tired of hearing francis's mouse voice? 😂
idk if its ciryl or his teammates on fifa but that game was tragic 😂
Francis after eating breakfast: where ma “cereal gone”?
Glad I don't live next to Moreno...
Ciryl Gane or his team member are top 70 in fifa. unexpected.
“I don’t just knock them out, I pick the round.”  -Francis “Uvuvwevwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwemuhwem Ossas” Ngannou
Hard to see Francis winning outside of landing a bomb. Cryil is just the better over all fighter
Ciryl is such a nice guy, that I feel sorry for him when I think about what Francis is gonna do to him 😱
i cant be the only one who thinks Ciryl Gane looks like Andre Bishop from Fight Night Champion surely‼️
Dang Francis called gane a joke with extreme confidence.
Hope everyone is good! The martial arts community is the best!
Did Tarantino direct this Embedded? Lots of feet shots that I didn't need to see
Why do you keep showing people's​ feet on close-up in this video?? Showing the bottom of the  feet on close-up as well and an extended period of time. What is the purpose of doing that??? Very poor choice of filming and editing. Shame on you for such a job.
Francis and Davison both are pretty arrogant and take from their ass.
Cyril, " I'm always focused on my mission, always always always" . . . Picks up the PS5 controller. Haha.   I'm excited for this card
Dunno why but this made me crack up😂😂😂 1:38
How humble can you be lol UFC champion and training in your own garage.    Come on Moreno and still!!!
"It's a heavy duty table because Francis is like 100 pounds"  Francis, the new flyweight champion.
LETS GO FRANCIS
This is the absolute best way to start the year, I think Ciryl Gane gets it done - he is "fuckus"
What a card to start the year!! Ngannou and Gane are an example of the bigger fighters reaching a new level. And with Jones and Stipe waiting in the wings, 2022 is shaping up to be a standout year for the heavyweights
Notice how there isn't interim belt holders in welterweight, middleweight, it's because they have been active and that's the only way to not have interim belts if you don't like them Francis? And to think how quick your cage time has been, I'd say that is a good deal where some fighters have to go the full 5 rounds 3 times a yr. And other organizations have fighters fight way more frequently.
Gane is  cooler than a cucumber
Seeing figueiredo on the phone to his son on his 3rd bithday makes you realise how much these fighters really sacrifice to get to the top. Respect
Why doesnt Moreno get a good barber 🤦🏻‍♂️
I remember when he said he was going to be an active champion.
Lol imagine Moreno had neighbors and their house is trembling 😂
And new 🇧🇷💯💯💯🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍💯💪 And new 🇺🇸💯💪👍💪💪💯💯💪💪
peanut butter on an apple wtf?!
I didn’t know Tom Segura was Ciryls’ coach
I want to see Stipe beat that ass one more time.
Someone get cereal a Xbox… PS5 is for turds
Chemtrails @ 8:17
Ladies and gentlemen the thousands in attendance and the millions watching around the world I bring you the UFC version of deonte Wilder really cannot fight but power is off the charts brings a level of fear to his opponents which makes them wait for delivery of the missile he has in store for them but his fighting skill is subpar yes I am talking about this f****** idiot right now he's a deontay Wilder who is a f****** chump and all it took was one man to stand up and get right off in his chest the very second any fighter can negate a amateur's fight style and not be afraid of his knockout power and out fight this man he's going to be the embarrassment of Nigeria
Keep it up! I am dropping 1 song a week for the next 3 years straight. It has never been done in music. Come along for the ride if you want. Stay blessed !  - Bryan
deiveson figueiredo seems a lot more genuine without his bald manager, Henry cejudo and his white glass wearing coach hanging around him doing cringy stuff
Fuck yes so hyped for this card! Too bad it's 75$ now. Let's go Moreno!
Merano and Francis you got this
Tbh, I even raged at some moments when Ciryl was playing Fifa
Brandon Moreno I believe will be the individual who motivates figgy to move up to fight Volk or Petr Yan. His weight cuts are too much. I believe in Ciryl Gane as well. That guys skills are just next gen, he's so adaptive in the moment in fight, like it's natural to him. He's still new to this too, it's crazy.
I hope brandon morano loses that clown  And that african gets outclassed by the french man
For some Reason i think Cyril Gane will Win hes 10:0 Undefeated he doesnt wanna Lose ... Its hard to beat Guys who never Lost we will see let the Show begin ^^
5:53 Tom Segura
let's goooo
Avero Djess: Yama 😃🥳🥳🥳
Gotta feel bad for Gane being stuck in the middle in a petty battle between his head coach and a former sparring partner.
Gane just chillin playing Fifa with the boys, he's one of us
Anybody else think Ciryl’s coach Ben looks like Tom Segura? 😂
Don't care much for the Moreno figured fight all I want to see is Gane vs Ngannou
nice to see tom segura showed up to play some golf at 5:33
Gaine has worst beard in mma
9:20 nice
Moreno all day!!!
Francis don’t think Ciryl is a joke please.. just respect him.. good luck for the both guys 👊🏻
Davison is scary looking not gonna lie. He looks like the main villain of a martial arts movie
Just finished making dinner, now I have something to watch while I eat
Francis sholuld do some voice acting, he has such a calm and soothing voice to the ear.
Davidson got me with that "Paying the price" shit..
Figgy: "The belt I lent you" Sure of you call tapping out lending it to him sure but to me I would say Brandon took it let's goooo Moreno🇲🇽 AND STILL!!!!🏆
You can tell the UFC Salty with Francis, they gave Cyril like 3 and half minutes of this episode and Francis gets 30 seconds 😂
Islam is the truth. Read the Qur'an
If Moreno loses it'll be a sad night..
I would be so happy if Francis starches Gane inside 2 rounds and then calls out Jon Jones by calling him a bitch ass wife beater who is scared to fight him.
Shows his PSN screen name. RIP
Francis was kinda right, Gane is a joke. No disrespect, he gets dangerous only if you fear him and fall for his smoke in the eyes. If not, he is, let s say, funny. But, Ngannou is not more serious, if you don t consider his body and wild savage animal mode, again, if he has the room to step in. I saw him against Lewis. Just wait for me. I am still training in Romania, and i will be untill the retirement.  It will be huge.
Disgusting chemtrails at the 8:14mm.  Thanks govt for spraying poison ☠️ on the people.
Deiveson’s weight cut is brutal… I think this will be his last fight in flyweight. Moreno beats him again
Did Francis’’MONSTER BBC’’Ngannou got happy ending?
Omg Francis has this little girl massaging him. HEY Francis fly me out, best deep tissue massage therapist on this side of the Mississippi (I’m in PA) . She ain’t even get into your delts smh
Figgy tapped😂 JORDI DONT TAP BABY ITS MY TIME
Me and Brandon go way back I remember I smashed his punk ass in middle school
Gotta start the day with a happy ending i c u Francis, my dawwg
Maybe if enough of us protest, the UFC will finally decide to extend this to 20 minutes. Each episode of Embedded is always too good to be just 10 minutes.
Ngannli is a punk I smashed him at the pub once
Figueiredo acting like he didn't get thoroughly outclassed in the rematch. Moreno dominated him in the stand-up and made him tap.
UFC Vlogger : so how do you prepare for your title fight ? Cyril : Fifa ? Golf ? Yeah
9:18 - Some powerful ass looking feet right there.
Cejudo helping out Figueiredo … shame on Cejudo
Brandon's boxing is excellent;  I think Francis creams Cyril
David looked like he suffered from a bad weight cut in both fights and it looked like he gave the belt away in his 2nd fight..i expect it to be more competitive this time around and won’t be surprised if David wins, but I am rooting for Moreno!
Francis Ngannou has the biggest feet in Anaheim on Saturday night.
Francis has his hands full but so does Gane … I thought the UFC rushed Gane but he gets past Francis I don’t see him losing to anyone.
I need Francis to KO Gane then to fight Fury. He’ll be huge after the Fury boxing match. No hate toward Gane. He is good, dangerous, and a nice guy. Also, how can you not like Brandon!
Gane  Brazil  To make sure that the job done
Ciryl Gane is what martial art is all about. I'm sure GSP is already a big fan of him.
8:30 i might be the only one but in my mind its like "naughty america, nobody, nobody, nobody does it better "
Go Ngannou Goooo!!! And still!!!
Ngannou wins by first round ko
9:10 bro you can literally see her... 💀
Let’s go Gane!!!
Hope gane wont use his dirty punches to the back of the head again
Glad to see Tom Segura doing well as Gane's coach
Smiling Francis can't hurt you, he can't even throw a jab.
finally
They use ngannu face as the promo and show 10 seconds of him and spend the whole time with Gane haha
Santa Moniqua
is he putting nutella on that apple?
Francois is a "needle mover", a knockout puncher, a terrifying individual and also the nicest guy ever how is it that the UFC can't pay him what he wants?
Cyril gane if he was a type of bread  Cyril naan
Moreno v Figgy is going to be fireworks, Figgy fighting while its his kids birthday too going to mean alot to him this fight
I really hope Ciryl wins. Big fan of him!
Ciryl Gane being ranked 64th in the world in FIFA PRO Club... is there anything this guy can’t do?
"The house had enough space for all the guys so I don't care" Wow. If we felt like that we could make a huge change.
Ngannou getting that happy ending. Gane is fucked 😂😂
Ngannou is going to kill. You can see his shape ( monster condition)The france  guy (gane) is to busy to play PlayStation, you got a lot off time to enjoy after this fight. Minimum 3/4 months recovery. Sorry dude.
As an extra F you to Francis they give him the least amount of time on the Embedded.
👍🏼 if you think Francis stays with the UFC, if not, comment below where you think he goes to:
Money on the line for francis any day!!!
There’s something so comforting about Ciryl chilling playing video games like a week before he faces the scariest mma KO artist of all time
It kind of seems like Figueirdo is trying to convince himself when he talks.
6.08 thats how you laugh .....in french 🐷🐷🐷
Lets go Gane
Battlefield 2042 sucks !! I want my $$ back!!!!
VAS-Y CYRIL TU VAS LE FAIRE, TU ES LE CHAMPION 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
5:32 I thought it's Tom Segura for a second💀
I hate seeing the constant phone usage-maddening and saddening at once. It's disrespectful to yourself and those around you. We'd all be better off without.
Gane owns Francis
Only thing that would make me stop being a Moreno fan would be him being into "my little pony."
Ayo I live next to Moreno
Francis stock goes up Saturday night! LFGGGG
😂😂😂 Ciryl et trop marrant irl !
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope gane wins
Me at 9:00 Wait a min...is this one of those Asians massage parlor hidden cam videos? 🤔🤔🤔
cant wait the fight but also the press conference between Gane and Francis
good lord the chemtrails, 8:14
Francis in his room: I need to defend. It's my last contract fight. Fuck Cyril is GOOD AF, dammit... also the whole country of Cameroon watching I cannot let them down.   Cyril in his room: So this is my new fifa record , guys.
Nice promotion of Francis lmfao
$75 😂😂😩😩
Ciryl playing fifa loool
Embed is back. The year just got better.
Someone going to 💤
9:12 yeee
9:16 I always believed that Bigfoot was a real thing
Gane out here livin his best life
ty
Black Panther feels
Here! We! Go!!!
Did he drink water in the sauna
Why censor the french curse words? 99% of audience wouldn't understand it
Golfing into the river, why y'all niggaz wasting those golf balls
Thought Ngannou would be fighting 3 times a year like Usman, unfortunately his relationship with Dana has soured.
Greatest match up of the year! Let’s go Brandon!
no way ciryl gane plays pro clubs 😂😂
Awful card atlesst we have hw’s, Moreno and topuira to keep us entertained biggest underdog I got is t.Giles
Gane playing pro clubs that’s cool !
If figgy had purple hair with the red stripe that’d be hard
12 kg Sledgehammer
Gane is going to send Francis into boxing
Hope he sends ngannou the big dosser into retirement
Very tough cut for figuerido
Gane plays pro clubs? I’m a fan ✊🏿
I wanna see francis win just for the chaos after.
Let's go Cyril 🇨🇵🇨🇵
9:17 motherfcker sleeps standing
What a good guy Cyril Gane!
Really hoping Francis wins, if only to increase the chances he stays with the UFC.
Brandon just needs a trim and he’s all sorted
Gane is Uber French right down to the _oh la las_ - I'm gonna challenge him on PS5 right now.
This is most likely Frances’s last fight in the UFC. That sucks, he’s the most exciting heavyweight of all time and he can move on fight Jake Paul and make 5 times as much money. His interview with Joe Rogan was epic, how he got to where he is now and what he went through is amazing. Fans will follow him to his next adventure for sure!
Calling that Moreno KO's deiveson in the 3rd and ngannou stops gane in round 2 or gane by decision
imagine video game kids raging when someone scores on them in FIFA and yelling "come over ill kick your ass in real life"
I’m Mexican and my hart is with Moreno but I don’t think figaredo is a bad person, he was smiling talking to his sons, and the way he carried Moreno after he lost. I think his team makes him do all the bad shit
Well it looks like that joke is ganna whoop that ass boy!! Lol Gane by knock out 💪🏽
Let's goooo figgy!!
Way to flaunt your ps5 thanks. Ngannou fuck him up lol
Gane will
I’ll be there in Anaheim! Let’s go
Tellement hâte! Allez, Ciryl! Ramène-nous cette ceinture undisputed en France!
Cyril playing FIFA and Golf instead of training, that's how you can its game plan is rock solid :D
This is probably my favorite part of UFC, not even the fights are as good as these series
I've been a fan of Francis for years and its heart breaking to see him lose a big fight hopefully he won't Saturday 👊
this heavyweight fight is so interesting because will francis just do what we know him to do or will gane be the answer and finish him 🧐so excited
ngannous got white feet?
really wish these were longer
Brandon Moreno annoys me. There I said it
Embedded Lord
Brandon "The Cry Baby" Moreno
That would be so damn cool to live next to Moreno lol
Brandon and Francis to retain there belts easy 💯
An asian masseuse without a bra rubbing a naked black man. I've seen that movie before...
Just shows people will step up in the UFC but not the best in the world
"Show me the dinosaur "got me🤣🤣🤣
It’s nice to be a UFC fan these days. Back in the day. Was maybe one card a month. Now there’s fights weekly (pretty much) love it.
Let's go Brandon!!
we need more from Francis!!
I bet the neighbours think "here we fucking go again" but don't want to say shit.....
Francis by uppercut
How many close ups of Figueirdos feet can you get.
Brandon's victory speech was so real I hope he wins again what a dream, keep on making the dream real my friend. Much love from Canada 🇨🇦
True colours will start to show
I like the camera mans surprise to the ranking.
Bon gamin 🇫🇷
Gane needs to tell us where he got his PS5 as I havent seen one in stock since launch 🙂
How can you not like assassin baby? Dude has one of those personalities where it’s hard to not like him.
the old peanut butter apple
Ngannou win or lose I love the person. How can you not like him
Always crazy seeing the heavyweights enjoying their best life while the lighter guys are trying and struggling so hard to make weight 🤣
Ngannou has the most soothing voice ever.
Represent!! Glad Brandon hooked up w Nate!
Does anybody know the title of that awesome outro sound???
Love the fact Gane is just chilling with his ps5 and playing golf lol.
Brandon looking sharp AF.
6:08 the fuck was that??
Daymn cyril gane is a ranked pro club player sheeeeesh
Let's go Francis Ngannou.  Let's go Africa 🌍 👏 🙌 💪 💙
Maybe if I eat apples like Brandon Moreno I won’t be a piece of shit 😭
Ciryl Gane being a fifa sweat is hilarious.
jan was the last fighter to play video games on embedded and he lost, now gane is playing games let’s see if he loses. gotta stay disciplined during fight week.
And Still x2
“Never wound what you can’t kill”
I hope francis ngannou pays pack his mma factory fees after defending his title
Let's not forget Francis said to Fernand " Coach I really like America"
6:08 When you take a potion in minecraft
When Ciryl Gane laugh, he always put a smile on my face.
thanks uncle dana for inventing this sport
Gane is the nicest guy ever
“You know what Conor told me?   He said I want Ngannou..in AFRICA!  Heheh isnt he awesome?!”
Cyril is so good at sports that it even translates to his FIFA skills. 64th in the world!!!?
Francis looking smaller this time around!
Brandon Moreno looks like he took sleeping pills when he woke up
@6:02 I have never seen a golf ball look so small lol
This year belongs to the good guys (moreno and gane) for the win🤞🏼
moreno cant seriously eat a green apple with peanut butter minging
Imagine playing Gane and his mates on Pro Clubs 😂
Hi champ Ciryle Gane 😃 ,I would like to challenge your club in fifa 22 Pro clubs please and thank you,good luck on your fight I’m rooting for you 🇫🇷 🥇
The main event champion was in the video for less than a minute?
They are real Marvel's.
These vlogs need to be longer. They're one of the few things I look forward to on YouTube
It’s funny that a lot of fighters forget that the ufc took them from nobody’s to household names
First embedded of 2022!! - *Francis Ngannou breathe laugh*
They didn't show the hole in the massage table for Francis' BBC.
You’re going to be reading these embeddeds more than watching them
Gane is no joke
Sounds like Ngannu is underestimating his opponent.
Dana praying moreno loses so we can see a 4th fight lol
Francis: His title is a joke  Ciryl: *plays fifa*
Francis = I knew he was a joke, and still just a joke, come saturday Gane will show the world who is the Big Clown, your ass will K.O the fuck out rd 2 by Ciryl Gane. lets see who the Joker hahaha
ngl i was waiting all day for the embedded and it did not disappoint
oh la la
I've just remember that the first fight ended as a draw, it means that Moreno has a win (sub) vs Figueiredo, and a majority draw... Dis fight doesn't makes sense, the brazilian has 0 wins over Brandon.
Im I the only one surprised how white are nunganu's feet.9:18
I hope moreno win again
Loving the blacked/massage rooms collaboration at the end.
Who do you guys think has the bigger meat between Francis & Ciryl, answer honestly
"I'm not the scariest I'm the nicest." Brandon Moreno
God damn it id fucking hate to see Gane get slept
Gane is shit at FIFA and Golf, but amazing at MMA, cant have it all i guess
Actually 🔥💯
damn they put his Fifa name out there .. rip his inbox
In my opinion Figuereido is training a lot harder /:
Gane seems very calm and collective From his fifa and golf  Can’t tell if this is a good thing yet but am gonna bet and say yes it is
No ones gonna talk about the peanut butter apple?. ok
Huge fan of Ciryl Gane playing Pro clubs
What if you’re online chatting mad shit to someone on fifa not knowing it’s fuckin Ciryl Gane
2:39
That Ngannou foot shot, at this point I think the Embedded team is in on the joke.
heavyweight champ of the world and he has no ladies? francis is sus ya'll. just saying
Francis is right about interim titles, complete crap 💩
Ciryl playing golf, trying to hit the moon and Mars.
That shit of Francis's massive feet boutta make me act up
How they bottling a sweaty bruh
Lego Legend ain’t giving up his belt
netflix: you still watching? someones daughter: 6:08
Francis weighs 100 lbs 🤣🤣🤣 I’m dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Most anticipated fight in over a year for me. Ngannou v "Surreal" Gane? I'd pay for that even if it weren't for the trilogy fight, as well.
I dont understand people who get mad at fighters for saying they want more money. Isnt that the point of all this
bet the house on gane. its an immortal lock. gane will dance around until ngannou gets tired. ngannou wants to go box, I think he possibly wants out of his contract.
How can you be so relaxed when you're fighting a man who sent stipe to another dimension
Being a heavyweight is the best, you dont have to worry about weight cutting,
I cant wait to watch Cyril beat that ass.
8:15 InshaAllah And Still ☝ Let's Go Champ
I'm flabbergasted and can't call it, however I do know that either Ngannou or Gane will be going night night...
Francis going to the shadow realm
NO WAY GANE ON PRO CLUBS IM CRYING
Lets go! I got Gane winning
Francis sitting there watching the poor girl put that table up 😂
Episode 1 and so does the excitement begins for the fight
Every time a guy that plays a game in an embedded, he always loses. Rip Gane
As an African, I'm supporting Francis because of his background and what he wants to do as the future champ of the division. As a fan of MMA I'd like to see Ciryl win so he can go up against Jon Jones because I feel that they would be the Ken and Ryu of the HW Division stylistically.    When it comes to Moreno and Figgy, I'm really a fan of the Mexican fighting spirit and brandons overall boxing abilities, so I'm going with him even though I still believe if Figgy has a solid game plan and doesn't let his emotions get the best of him he could win.   Damn what a card to start the year.
Feels so good to be back!
Video games are a crucial part of humanity.
9:17 Ngannou's feet 🤤😛🦶🏿
Did she finish him at the end🤔😆
2:57 I genuinely thought that Gane said “ i got an open net “ I must’ve been to focused on the game 🤣
Gane is trash
Can’t wait for obligatory I love Cyril fan girls in the comments
9:27 BLACKED
I love Moreno but I will fill bad if Figueiredo lose
9:18 Tarantino frame
A joke? Watch out Fracis!
09:02 Francis ready for Happy Ending :)
fracis is soo over with himself .. im 195 ... but i would beat the hell out of that high raised nose ... i swear to god... sence hes not humble anymore , i really really dislike him .. HOPE GANE WINS!!!
We need a dc interview gane on the golf course
Gane gonna pick him apart. watch the kicks
8:25 Ngannou should challenge Moreno for the belt and become a 2 division champ. He's only like 100 lbs he should be able to make weight with ease
i wish Ngannou wins because its going to piss off Dana... The heavyweight champ of the world deserves a million dollar paycheck everytime he fights. Pay Francis Dana.
First Embedded of the year ❤ So excited 🥰
DAMN I love Francis, the level of disrespect being shown to him right now by ROGAN and everyone else who has just GIVEN Cyril the belt before they've even fought is INCREDIBLE in my opinion. But its hard to root against a guy like Cyril dudes energy is just magnetic he seems like an all around good dude. GOOD LUCK TO BOTH.
If you close your eyes when Moreno is speaking its just Cris Cyborg
Dude everytime Ciryl does or says something I can't help but smile 😂😍
2:39 that's what she said
zzzzzzz i feel like i snorted heroin watching this
Francis is sooo HIGH on himself...
solid episode
Let's go Ciryl
"When you want to conquer something in life... You got to pay a price", well said Figgy. Beside that, Moreno is going to win 😌
Tony The type of guy to hide in Francis’ punching bag to condition his durability
so figgy got a haircut on Embedded... Moreno via UD
Nganu
Figueiredo is looking very unhealthy. He should definitely switch up to Featherweight after this fight
Francis trying to sell PPVs calling Gane a joke…
Biggest fight of his life and this guy is casually playing fifa hahah
6:08 Ciryl Gane laughs like a tractor
Seeing gane play pro clubs makes me not want to see him get knocked out if he even does
Gane breaks out his mythical Twister or my name isn't Yannis
4 title fighters and not even one fluent english speaker
Does Gane ever get angry? What a likeable guy
1st embedded of 2022 lesgooo! 👀
very psyched for his card
Gane looks like your average gamer
ea new model brandon and all the fighters from 2015
I don’t want Cyril or Francis to lose both of them are likeable guys. May the best fighter win.
6:08 Cyril got the SL0ppy T0ppy
9:16 WTF is that camera angle? 😂 Also, Francis feet are weird, they're long wide on the back and  round, but they don't get wider on the front. 🤨
french is such a gay language
2:54 how you not score that? LOL
moreno having all his guys at his house is goat shit
Every time I see Ngannou in videos hes like getting massages, pedicures, wearing expensive ass watches buying houses and then also crying he ain't got no money... The dude has no idea how to manange it... He needs a financial advisor.
Boring
let’s go Predator 🔥 🔥 🔥
What’s that circle tattoo on Moreno left shoulder represent? Aldo had that same thing on his chest or something if im not mistaken?? 🧐
Francis has crazy KO power and has improved so much since his first title fight. Definitely the scariest fighter on the roster. With that being said, Gane via TKO
Chemtrails
I have the same JBL headphones, they're good... the mic not so much
Cannot stand whiny Francis
Gong playing that ps5 was humbling
After Francis gets an MMA lesson from Ciryl he can go to boxing and fight whoever he wants
Figueredo loses and blames it on a bad weight cut for the 3rd time
Gane x Moreno parlay only because that's what I want to happen and it'll make it so much better if they win.
An sleepy brandon is just too cute
🇨🇲 🇿🇦🇸🇳🇿🇦🇨🇲🇿🇦🇨🇲🇿🇦🇨🇲🇿🇦🇨🇲🇿🇦🇨🇲🇿🇦🇨🇲
Ciryl Gane has that super likeable energy that JDS had. Francis is awesome, but I hope Ciryl wins, it'd be good for the division to mix things up.
bored now
How much is PPV?
lets go francis
These vlogs are my favorite thing from all fight week
ciryl game
Give me the ps5
Gane is a monster on pro clubs tf 64 ranked team what can this man not do
I've been waiting for these!
The bass in Francis voice is pretty scary lol. Love the guy.
EEW 0:14
let’s freaking go!   thank goodness for the content.
Moreno is 100% impossible to root against for me. He's like childhood innocence personified. I always wondered what was up with the look he gave DF when boxing...it's the SAME LOOK HE GIVES HIS PEANUT BUTTER APPLE! Note how he raises his chin and kinda smirks at the apple...he did the same before piecing up the ex-champ!
That assassin baby X Nate Diaz Represent jersey is 🔥🔥🔥
I don't get people who think Ciryl is scary. He may not have Franics' mass, but has mass + speed. He will be a problem for Francis.
I have a feeling Francis is getting TKO'd in this fight...
almost a 10 minute video and the heavyweight champ is only in it for less than a minute and a half. UFC ain't even trying to be subtle anymore lol
If someone with a thick african accent doesnt come out during Ngannou's entrance and yell "HE IS KING" then im not watching
I like it when the fighters punch each other
Me on Saturday 3:22
Ciryl playing pro clubs u just love to see it 😂
Someone get that man an apple slicer,  that was some cringe ass shit!
Francis with the oriental rub and tug
This whole things going to backfire on Francis when Gane dominates him like he did to Derrick. No belt, those boxing offers will dry up and he'll end up renegotiating for probably the same amount he is fighting for now...
Man Francis is banging that Massage woman 100%
Waiting hours for this - they late on this one....Saturday gonna be a banger though.
8:15 . . .
Fight week 🔥🔥
Please someone, what is the most probable swear word he is using? I don't know any French but I love swear words
Who are you betting on?  Ngannou or Gane?
Lesssssgoooooo
Embedded editor has foot fetish.
2:00 gane is legit good at everything haha
It seems that Francis is taking this fight too personal. He needs to clear his mind and execute his game plan because Gane is no joke.
Tom Segura is Ciryl Gane's coach?
Nice vlog
nobody who plays fifa will win a world title. i hope im not wrong
8:25 If Francis was 100 pounds I don't think he would be fighting at heavyweight.
Finally
Anyone else wondering how they get the golf balls out of the lake?
I have no idea who’s gonna win my prediction is for Ngannou to get the KO inside 2 rounds but I genuinely have no idea how it’s actually going to play out. But I hope gane gets sparked simply because too many heart broken stipe fanboys jumped on ganes hype and are saying Ngannou has no chance at winning like they didn’t say that about stipe 2 and look what happened
I hope Moreno loses then we won't see this LEGO shit no more....😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
They should invite Colby and Jorge to the press conference just to make it entertaining
I love how humble and Nice Francis is, he’s a completely different person inside the cage than out
Francis ngannou for the winnnn
if we end up talking about figgy vs merono instead of gane ngannou its a bad ppv
Damn ngannou’s feet are whiter than white people 9:21
ahah 100 and something pounds. not sure about that
I hope gane gets his eyepoking under control.   He extends his fingers into opponents faces a lot
Bon Gamin!
let‘s go brandon!   😂
Figgy’s son definitely got his father’s spirit  😂
Cyril is a straight up chill, man baby inn The good way
Gane has a second face behind that head of his or a double forehead Idek
2:54 They blew a 4 on 0. 😂
Go gane and Moreno
His feet are weird. So much padding on them. Does he even need shoes?  I suffer from a condition whereby I don't have much fat padding on my heel. It sucks, always have to be careful what shoes I wear.
POV: Here after they reposted a whole countdown episode
I swear Brandon and gane are the same person
Man I feel like I notice more sponsors through the UFC than any other sport. They go through sponsors like copy paper.
1:47 No way Cyril is in a pro clubs team in fifa that's 64th in the world lol.
How can you not get a smile on your face when you see Brandon Moreno
8:24 her basically saying, "HELP ME LIFT THIS FRANCIS!!!"
UFC 270 is basically: The Scariest (Ngannou and Figueiredo) vs The Nicest (Moreno and Gane). First embedded of the year, feels damn good!
YES FINALLY
Francis is definitely losing this one. Gane is too fast and has a bigger gas tank
took you long enough!!! was itching for this
Let’s gooooo
Masvidal getting 50-42’d
Gane is an ass and I don't buy into his nice guy act. He releases training footage of him out striking francis and then goes ahead and messes up his friends negotiations with Dana by accepting an interim belt
5 days boys🔥🔥
I'm not to pumped for this one
FINALLY
EMBEDDED IS BACK !!!! 😭
I could watch an hour long episode on just brandon moreno
Franciryl Ngane
Francis is an incel, i hope he wins
First Embedded of 2022.   A moment of silence please.
Francis reminds me of a young Artem Lobov
"Never zig when you should have zagged, See you at the top!" - Michael Chandler
So hyped for this card...
DMT and elk meat makes you bald - Joe Hogan
I just want Francis to win in vicious fashion just to watch UFC deal with the shit show after 😂
Ciryl Gane will make it look easy.
Finally! Embedded is back!   Altho i still wonder why they deleted and reuploaded the countdown videos 2days later after north of 700k views.... 🤔
Was he eating peanut butter and apple
How about Ngannou vs Mcgregor?
💯💯🔥🔥
Gane will win
Gane s gonna win
Finally something to watch
first
Hi mom
And still
Gane by tko round 4 take it to the bank
First
first!
Yo
