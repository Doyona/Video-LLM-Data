Déjà vu, huh? I think my memory is going...
17:55 I squeezed my ass so hard for IGP
4:01 hi doe.  11:24 ok thanks?  14:04 no. I'm not laying down for you. Your not my mom!
0:13  Don’t you mean South Park?
wtf the sponser says "We save ball" i mean what is that meant to mean
You should try Siren head Nithorn
Epic they remade the game from years ago!
HEY HOW DO U INSTALL
Imagine seeing sahur negotiator in 2094.5 :lol 💔
99 gece benzemiyor mu robot iyi bak
Siren head is an alien that was worked on by scientists and then was sent back in time say yes siren head would have been around in the 1700s cuz scientists made it that way
can we talk about that scream? LOL @8:32
At 9:10 the ice-cream truck song would have got me lol
😔✌️🥀🥀
that wendigo was nice. he was probably annoyed that siren head was soo loud in the middle of the night
its that mahoraga before you escape
his voice is so beautiful😍😍😍/j !! 6:11
11:18 is that zoom 💀
I love how you edit the vids
*HERETIC YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE!!!!*
Conspiracy theory.  U dont have to censor stuff.  Ppl upload vids with open human skull and brain next to it
I didn't see shit...
When you’re crapping yourself out of fear but it’s okay because a cookie run add just came on
The "Get a load of this guy" gets me everytime, I think it's because it's so weird to think that Siren Head has an attitude like that.
11:21 he’s part of an old lore i forgot what it’s called. Can’t believe they added that mythical monster in this game.
7:33 darkiplier?  coincidence I don’t think so.🤣🤣
0:14 Sauron
the way IGP screams the first time he sees siren head is hilarious😂
2:09😂😂😂 ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oh my gosh god😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😰😰😰😰😰☠️😰☠️😰💀😰💀😰💀😰☠️😰💀💀😰
😰😰😰😰😰😰😰
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I feel like the unknown being at the end when u escape is Trevor Henderson the guy who made siren head and the other creepy pastas
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
at least in siren head southpoint u get a checkpoint for everything u do, cuz in the other siren head game that was created by isolation interactive there were no check points in that one, meaning if siren head killed u in that one u had to restart from where the car u drove is next to the meadows sign.
What was the blurred thing?
Why does siren head sound like ultron? Ngl kinda fits tho
the fact dat he knows who u are and talks to u is just cool
Game name?
Who’s here in 2025
ive seen this vidoe plenty of times and sirne hed crawling at you still gets me
Stupid little thing, I know....but what factory with heavy equipment like that has a tile floor?🤔😅

Bruh I didn’t realize my playback speed was in 2x speed and I was so confused and a was rolling on the floor laughing 🦹‍♂️🌂🌂🐸🌝🍠🍠🎟️🛴🛴🚅📀⛎🈹🆑
"Get a load of this guy😏." If I was him, I would just lay on my back and wait. Wait for what you ask? DO IT AND YOU I'LL FIND OUT" 13:48
Anyone else think he sounds like Markiplier when he yells?
Clark Anna Hernandez Cynthia Garcia Joseph
Lopez Daniel Young Michael Jones David
Apparently a lot of dumbasses got herself killed out there😂😂😂
Mr. @IGP if you reduced the pixel on the censored part of your video, will YT allowed it? Or it still will be demonetized? Try it next time on your other channel, make it barely visible.
Idk if it’s always been an intentional reference but I’m so glad you acknowledged the Punisher image in my head whenever you say that
this reminds me of that one siren head game from four years ago, pure nostalgic memories 🫡

As siren head blared that john had been killed my computer started to lag really bad   Me:!?!?!
What did you see? 2:09
VR support?
😂😂😂 6:43 6:47
Maybe the invention of the siren was inspired by Siren Head.
1:14 pause it and look at the paper 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
4:57 boing!
Anyone here in 2024?
I like to think siren head is making the chase music
7:06 does anyone else see that smile looking thing above the rocks?
I hate how this guy talks. The ingame guy not IGP. I dont hate you man. But the protagonist sounds like the average tiktok E-Boy
Horrible voice acting. Can't even spell words correctly. Even the dialogue is completely unrealistic, whether or not they delivered it even decently. Even the game itself doesn't know if it's exploration or action. At the end, you finish the game like it's piss. As a game itself, it's poorly designed. There isn't even any rhyme or reason between the creatures. And they generally explain there are "deities" but there's no clear connection between them. Not even an explanation of the Wendigo and why it communicates (with horrible delivery and lines, again) to begin with. The lore is the focus of this game and even THEN it doesn't even really develop it, or provide anything that makes SENSE. Where is their due diligence? These people should hire us to perfect their games and do quality control. We make a buck, they get better sales and reputation. Ridiculous.
Bro, that's way taller than 40 feet. That's at least 70 feet tall.
16:00
i like how he just says shut the duck up to siren head lol
-uh hello-
2024 gang
Who sees this in 2024 and still decides to click on it
15:04 “hey Freddy come here😊😊” “Shut the fuc up”
I think out of all the Siren Head games that I've played, I'd say that Siren Head: SouthPoint is honestly my most favorite one.
Kinda. One screaming kind of makes me funny
1:30 Wait a minute. That's Cougar!!!
why he scream at 2:09 explain pls
i think because I learn of ssirenheaad as a kid, now as a teen i am sub consciously super afraid of it
I know the original voice actor for the hunter commented, but I didnt want to reply to his comment specifically because I didnt want to hurt his feelings. The hunter literally sounds like a total anime dweeb.
I miss when Siren Head and entities like it were popular, not just brain rot content. It's mainly the fact that now if you search up and of Trevor's creatures, it just ends up being brain rot minecraft content. Very annoying.
Please I want this game ❤❤❤
I was scared at night because I was wanting it to be day 😂😂😂😂😂😊😢
Idk if siren head crawls 😅😢😮🎉
0:20 not Scp 096😭
2:07
at 29:13
WE SAVE BALLS
funny fact siren head was much older than you think even if he made no siren noise he copied human sounds and animal sounds
I love how siren head says ‘get a load of this guy’ bro is sarcastic as heck lol
What happened to the old game with a story you were playing??
girl how do you not know? obviously when stranded in the forest you trust the windego  common knowledge
15:32 Not the laughing!!!!
🚨…
deer: ba. BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1:24  want a break from the ads
That was an extremely short game
" we save balls " at 1:14 was wild, lmao 😂😂😂😂
If its coming prone or crouch down
i played it and its good tanks for making this video
8:32 actually a fire beat i started jamming and 9:02 why did the lethal company song play
I just noticed, when we first see siren head at 8:33 the Protag shoots him, AND SIREN HEAD IS KNOCKED BACK and I have to say WHAT CALIBER IS THAT RIFFLE
2024? Anyone?
i dont understand 2:08
Is it just me or do his hands get bloody at 5:58
i love the scream
Is that a markiplier plush at the start of the video
The officer on the radio sounds like @The Dark Somnium 12:45 curious.
Huh, a friendly goatman. Fancy that.
5:00 dude that scream alone goes close to pewdipies screams wtf🤣
Bro siren head is talking💀
I like how siren heads alarm is loud
It is scary!
anyone think 2:01 was goofy?  He reacted and turned before the silhouette was visible.
Man , It's Huge
11:23 the heck is that thing
"What the F*** are you" At the ending is the best
the hearts are the source of the power *proceeds too shoot heart*
wanted to escape wendigo T_T
what game is this
27:54 he sleep
Siren head is bad enough when the cryptids even tell you to leave
eyyy
I loved that he was stopped by at the campsite
Siren heads run is so goofy 😂
Who from 2024?
what was the thing that you blurred? like at the window where he walked by
Bruh this is so scary        becareful of siren head because his sirens are loud don't gain his trust because he is scary which is my nightmare
9:00 DUDE IT'S LETHAL COMPANY SOUNDS
Does anyone know what was actually under that bell when he said I can’t show that on YouTube?
Bro, I know this is probably gonna get like no comments and likes and he’s probably not gonna see it but the deer person I think is one of the people that died in the town because he was praying to the heart
you earned my like as soon as I heard you say Gonads 😄
New fear unlocked: Going camping
3:40 buddy screams like a girl
24:42 was that a sack tap?
I like how the music was call of duty zombies after he killed siren head
Fake fear
When you said "you can't get me with that ice cream music" I was thinking to myself "yeah because your not Joe Biden" 😂
me?
096 scream go crazy
I like how that one with the antlers gave a warning to get out rather than attacking
This is a comment.
God these games are so horrifying but your commentary makes it hilarious. The fear in that scream at 8:34 was fucking gold. And the screen shaking on top of it made it feel all the more genuine. I love this 😂
I love how  3 years ago you played this and you did again
IS THAT THE LETHAL COMPANY SONG?
TBH, smash
Friendly terrifying wendigo man who shows up to give you a warning is kinda charming.  “Dude, how did you grow up here and not figure out this was cryptid forest. We’re all friends here, just chilling, no killing - maybe a little light spooking. Except for Big S - and now Big S is awake and your making him mad, please leave, kthx bye!”  Also, IGP pressing prone after he’s been explicitly told this was an option to end the game and that it has now sneak mechanics then wondering what happened is peak IGP - I get he plays these games far longer than we watch them and this is a job, but his attention and memory span is so short I sometimes wonder if it’s faked, then he makes a genuine error and I see it’s not!  I’m impressed with the sound work in this game, not flawless, but for this genre it was absolutely excellent, the audio around the various states of Sirenhead and the way it taunts you were great!
"wait,wait,wait,wait WAIT WAIT" got me laughing
Slay!
8:13 If you look veeeeeeeryyy closely you can see siren head behind the tree right above the crosshair, coming from the direction of the radio voice (I wonder why???) You might want to pause it to see it.
Was instantly annoyed the car turns without the wheel moving.
the shitty action music really ruins the atmosphere lol  it completely ruins any sort of tension.   and why would they put bgm in a game where the enemy literally has speakers as a head?
I love how he said I feel safe now (a few minutes later) SHREIKS OF PURE TERROR
Weird but cool.
I like how you first time saw a gun in this game and said "OH YEAH BABY"lol that got me dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
why do you sound like markiplier?
Hell yea Markiplier
next up, steering head
Hello everybody, my name is Marki- I mean IGP and welcome to another blah blah blah
I watched this at 1 am
Siren Head is a troll😂
People who saw in the sponsor is said balls
I like how the wendigo is also tired of siren head's bulshit
i cant play it did you get early acess?
I heard sodden head today at night it was scary 😢😢😮😱😱
For someone who plays a lot of horror games, you are terrible at playing horror games.
Sirenhead
6:41 UNCLE BEN?
5:30 i imagined that shrek would had burst out of there and said SOMBODY-
It’s Made in Unreal Engine 5? Cool
Dear IGP, we never see it...
siren head my son
Oh my god, Igp when I grew up I was different, instead of watching baby shows or anything like that, I watched you. I remember sitting in a chair and watching your 9 hour rust stream and watching all your generation zero videos, igp you played a huge part of my childhood, I love you g❤
Are you a scary cat scary cat
It says to wish list
So having seen the wendigo thing I like the idea of their being a forest full of Cryptids and one of the ones we would consider to be hugely terrifying comes up to a human and is just like "Oi mate, best clear off. The guvnuh is comin and 'e aint too noice like me see? So off you go, on your bike." And then runs away to flee the apex cryptid.
Honestly just feels like its trying way too much, way too fast Got actually nauseous from jokey intro, finding friends, tower outta power, Siren trying to give head, Windego being friendly, back to tower
2:08 that OOOOOOOOOOOOH sends me into fits of laughter every time  I imagine the protagonist calmly driving and murmuring while you are in the passenger seat screaming and yelling
i whould just wait in tower till day
oo
what a nice thing to watch when im about to sleep and looking at the window 🪟
Hell to the naw, I said HELL NO everytime he got jump scared lol
Eh, 6/10. If we got to t bag siren head after he got yeeted id give it 10/10
The PC’s name is Teddy Henderson.  Bet that’s a nod to Trevor Henderson, who created the Siren Head.
That light moving was light head
My pc is so fucking stupid, it's monitor has Dozens of pixels and cant handle this video on 480p, the internet is ass too, Like wtf
Why don't you try it out here jour friends and see how day recakt hmmmm
Just imagine that a video game has to be blurred for YouTube. I thought YT was a progressive and liberal company. Idk..they seem kind of Orwellian now, kind of pathetic if you ask me. Kind of ruins the whole meaning of YOU-TUBE.
I just know i'm gonna get jump scared dead
I feel like the only underwhelmed person here.
00:21 thats an scp sound
yes
did the wendego call you a dick? dik but I herd dick.
Darkiplier 😂
This game got a massive overhaul I guess! It looks so good now!
2:08 and 3:42 i love his reactions XD I'm crying lmao
Looks like the protagonist is related to IGP I think we all know why
Wasnt this based off a more simpler version of this game a long while back? I just remember seeing thr same billboard
DADDY
Na lam out💀
don't die from siren head
IGP WHAT did you see on the hill didn't see anything
11:42 one of the friends -freddy anderson-
Sponsor ad ends at 1:24.
2:07 why do you sound exactly like Markiplier.
Wonder if Siren head is a anomalie that are in the Scp files
Can siren head die in real life
As I was watching this I was literally shatting out bricks 😂😢😂😢
Is this game on console ps4 or ps5? Pls replay
Seeing Siren Head crawling on all fours that fast being that big has to be the scariest shit I've seen in a horror game😨🥲
I really liked that scene of siren head dying
@IGP the defeat ending im pretty sure the end credit that is pyramid head and southpoint is in the silent hill universe dumb theory but a theory is a theory
Holy shit, I know the guy who voices the narrator in the beginning of the game, I think he does voice acting for the emkay or ezpz youtube channel
the sponsor is killing me
Can i trust this website to download game?
I think I remember this game still back in 2020 or 2021, something like that(I don't  really know anymore). It was pretty simple and had a weird TV filter on it.
10:14 Kakuyoin??
8:30 this fucking scream 😂😂😂😂
I can’t believe they incorporated other cryptids into this!
It would b so nice if we could get it without u taking !!
I got scared at 18:03 for no reason
Darkiplier BRO i died of laughter
27:48 wait hisdeath noise sounded like a beat
Tbh I love the content of this version of the Siren Head game but you just can’t beat that horror of the original version!
Ik this abit late to comment but I've seen no other ones asking this and I desperately need an answer idk it its bad video quality on my end but what is the IT IGP sees from the car widow on that music cue at 2:06 to 2:09?"
Can you make your content inclusive by formatting the auto captioning into closed captioning please? it is extremely hard to watch it relying only on the auto captioning sadly (I'm Profoundly Deaf)
Is it free??
A hunting rifle ain't gonna do squat to a wendigo
0:22 SCP 939? Many Voices?
You sound like Markiplier
how did you get it for me it says coming soon
U have the best videos
what was with the silent hill looking character at the end
When a Wendigo says its bad and you need to leave, you know things are seriously fucked
The things siren head says is horrifying and some of the best lines from it I’ve ever heard in a game truly amazing
28:42 Pyramid head?
Its weakness is bullets! It gets weaker the more holes you put in it!
9:02 10:34 Want some candy? 13:00 Yeeaaahhh.. You see that thing dont ya. Yeah I see that thing too, with both my eyes. Thats a Nope. All that teleporting around way over there (coughCHEATINGcough), and walking maybe, yeah that too. 14:10 An interesting point I would like to bring up is: "WHY" your here. Think about it.. You were invited here by your friends, right? And then most assume the kids got killed after that invitation, yes? But what about this: What if Sirenhead was listening in to the kids camping, got the intel he needed and killed them. And THEN, called YOU. That's pretty messed up eh? That level of intelligence, planning, etc.. This game is crazy. 16:45 He used to come sprinting at you ALOOOOT faster in the older versions. 20:47 Yes please. Do this to Icy. lol
i geuss the skin walker is friendly
Being the monster must not be scared but being the victim is scary
8:34 that scream 😂
Is it possible that siren head always made that sound and wasn't recognized as a siren sound until a similar sound was created in the 1800's.
Here’s a challenge watch it in full screen like i did
“Missed an opportunity, that’s why I should make horror games!” Actually I would definitely love to play a game made by IGM! With all of his experience with horror games, he would definitely be able to make something scary!
"Casually waking through the woods" : sees big tall tree man:  "intense screaming" "mental panic"😂
will it be multiplayer??
2:08 me when my favorite home less man wins a fight
Dude sounds so much like markiplier
Never mind wendego not friendly.
No it was not the wendigo mimicking someone it was siren head it does that alot.
Friendly wendego?
what was that at the end as he was driving away
Markiplier clone vibes
only in ohio
16:00 why tf did that scare me
litteraly nobody....:  Deers: PWON
no  idea why but 15:04 is so funny
Dude that’s how real sheep sound?
POV: you walkin’ around *hears sirens* keeps on walking “probably nothin!”
You only died 4 times, pretty good
L asset flip ahh game 💀💀💀💀
15:04 got me lol
Funny, that scream when Siren Head first shows up! Lmao!
Lol imagine you just trying to survive to a giant horrifying cryptid in the woods and when you believe you are safe house in a building the Wendigo itself appears in front of you.
this is how it should be!
bro is that thing at the end of the video the spiky blind zombie from the walking dead with a hand crank for eyes and heaD
It seems the plan is to tell you a mix of what you want to hear as well as what you don't effectively using your memories and thoughts against you. When you finally go insane or let your guard down, it strikes, and as it's telepathic, it knows exactly where you are at all times. Keep a level head and be cautious. That's the trick to defeating these kinds of threats.
IGP held in that cough since world war 1 💀
27:48 You Defeated Siren Head Boss
i say shut the fuck up and stop lying ?! what? Siren had a game in 2023 ?! better be true or im gonna report your video 😂
when you saw sirene head the for the first time. some people will call that a scream but they are wrong, that is a god damn war cry
big jumpsacre once siren head apeard 💀💀
1:25 love how he definitely thought he was hitting a quicktime event 🤣
tf was the thing at the end
Finally a siren head video that isn't claiming he is real
they had the goat man from do u copy in it
this game is actually two ish years old or the og one is. its really cool to see this game updated
I nearly get hearth attack
*How i wouldve reacted if i saw blood stains everywhere* Me - WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!!!!!!!!!!! WHO DID THIS I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE MAN!!!!! *How the protagonist reacted* Protagonist - Who did this? D: hmmm I think ill explore more :D Me -   ................
I like how they got siren head’s speed correct. On two feet it goes about 24 mph and on all fours 258 mph
What are you doing in me swamp!?
Imagine this, in vr
just me or instead of freddy anderson i heard trevor henderson
i dont understand this game. how can i interact when i see the hand icon?
Get a ooad of this guy  -siren head
Is the game multiplayer?
The goatman was like MANSCAPED LEMME HEAR
I think the're talking about the cripdids. They were saying plurle.
The sponsor 💀💀💀
💩💩💩💩👹👹👹🤡🤡🤡👹👺
*noise* OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  yeah the trees are very scary
why is Cougar macdowall Voice acting the charracter wtf
I love how he's just talking to siren head like it's his friend. "Dude", "dawg". Exactly how I act in every horror game. 😂
Alright, so I did a little digging, and this game is a remaster of the original Sirenhead game, also made by UndreamedPanic. I knew I'd seen this before!
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😅😅😅😅😅😅
Voice actor is fro Emkay on youtube sounds like
Siren head is a really old myth from the dunes of egypt to the waters of greece and even through the forest's of rome but it's just a myth so it's probably not real
I could tell the radio he called was from siren head to and he didn’t notice it evhoed
He sometimes sounds like Mark. I love it
So they give you a toy gun more or less can't save even one person sucks.
11:17 that sou ds like savitar from the cw flash
Siren head FANS 👇👇👇
I watched this one when jacksepticeye first played it they added so much to the game 😮 it’s so cool!
W. T. F
he sounds like markiplier
captions would be cool for us who are ear stupid
If y’all wanna skip the sponsorship well 1:23
IGP - It's genius. The game lies to you and then kills you and tells you there is multiple endings! Lol. Idk about genius, but... yeah. Hey. There's multiple endings so now you know.
like this comment if u would have fallen for the ice cream truck sound 🥶🥶
0:21 You had to use SCP 096 for the noise🤦‍♂️
8:33
13:48 WHY IS HE SIREN HEAD VOICE HOT WHY           WHY WHY WHY               the voice kink is real
As th manscaped advertisement started with the (just forgot the English nem of his thing so I'll go with the German one) Waldschrat I was like: oh yeah goddamn he needs some of that.
bro why do you sound like siren head at 2:07 wtf
Hi this is so good I love thIS PLZ  MAKE MORE VIDS!
For me, what's scarier is all the tick possibilities.
IGP with the " jesvs chrvst!!! "
5:06 The truck after eating Chipolte
“He couldn’t exist, the very first siren was invented at the end of the 19th century” how tf do you know that? Lol
I only watch you, icy and skilly since you are the only gamers that don’t irritate me with poor gameplay. Most channels are people who are really bad at games, miss a lot of content and suck at editing. Keep up the good work!
The voice actor sounds a lot like cougar but it isn’t🗿
The developer or the creator of that game must be an og dude, i respect him
SIRENS WENT OFF AT MY HOUSE, ITS NOT STOPPING, ITS GIVING ME EEEE IN MY ears
THEY DID NOT JUST USE THE 096 SCREAM IN A SIREN HEAD GAME.
Shi. He is fast!
Scary😂
holy shit the first time I saw siren head in this video I just up and was so scared and I was not even playing the game. hey by the way I can make you a siren head game I'm a horror game developer and have been one for 6 years if you do want me to make one just like the comment or respawn I don't care what you do
2:07 3:34
precedes to tell a deer to shut up in deer lol
I know he has a deer skull head but I think the deer skull cryptid isn't a wendigo, but I believe its one of the other cryptids in a piece trevor henderson made. I could be mistaken but usually wendigos look a bit different, and considering the plot and the fact he prayed to the heart in the church, he may have neen a person at one point and became a cryptid over time. Not 100% on that though, just a haunch.
On PC?
Dislike of pistachio
matpat should do a video on this
why did you kill the only one that had humour
the random deer just existing and making noise really takes you out of it. especially since it doesn't even sound like it's coming from them. deer don't even make noise like that and aren't anywhere near as abundant as they are in this game. it also keeps you from feeling alone
Man you should make a horror game or 2 yk because with your knowledge on different types of horror games I think it would be absolutely badass but IF you were to id recommend a multi platform
The main question I have is where all that bright light comes from.
8:35 quick fear quick actions, nice shot bro
A baby can crawl on screen and IGP will be like OMFG WTF WAS THAT
Fun fact: there’s a secret ending called: 4 FRICKING PIXELS where you see a picture of SCP 096. DONT search up images you’ll die
11:18 wendigo
fun fact: this game was a remake of sirenhead by undreamed panic
8:34 Bro good no scope
IGP can you do more videos of  URGE. Also thank you for what you do.
that was scary. Love it
" As an animation student i love the game and all its assets its simple shapes and detailed enough to see and remember everything...........but the funny thing is the reason why I clicked on this horror vid.......        TO HEAR IGPS SCREAMS"
8:33 there’s prolly a comment on this already but the scream he makes when he sees or hears siren head for the first time was hilarious. 😂 💀
I would suggest for the game when you’re near Sirenhead for the players POV to start dissipating and slowly erroring out the more you’re near him since the sounds and just his appearance himself start interfering with the cameras signal. I would also suggest for the player when getting chased to get around 4 seconds of an adrenaline and get a speed boost.
I love how in the beginning he does even turning his steering wheel 😂
The protagonist sounds like cougar macdowell.
i want the scary shit
Is this on steam?
u posted it in 2022
I am so frickin happy that people are still making siren head games! He is by far my favorite fictional creature and it just a masterpiece!
No i did not see it
17:55 where did that sound effect come from?
that moment when a fucking Wendigo shows up and warns you to get tf out of that forest because the big monster is so, so much worse
"we save balls"
bro you know its a good game when im not even playing it and getting the chills
damn siren head stopped being famous in the 2021 i think?but damn some sirenhead games really follow the concept of fakes like using a missing report from the past to taunt the protagonists was smart and the fact the game had nice graphics although there are some bugs like no clipping randomly also could've been nice to add some jumpscares here and there.
Love u IGP u ar the best //got your  name Right this time =D
Izin ngab
Was that the thing from silent hills at the end
too exagerated streamer!
5:46 : every American after buying a gun and shooting up a school
2:05 I have bad eyesight anyone else know what he was screaming at
jeaaa siren head
bruv got warned by the wendigo
this over acting is just bad
Thats the jankiest rifle ever
Where can you find this game on a game system
Siren head doing the Ohio walk
Sweet, love the terror of it UvU
That thing in the window is cartoon cat or cartoon rat
the note said that there were 5 hearts you only destroyed 3 maybe there is a bonus ending if u destroy all 5 hearts
whats the pron button?
IGP how do you not get nightmares or get jumpy From this stuff? Like i Watch these videos and Even in the daylight my anxiety levels go up!  Edit: Bruh I couldn’t sleep the previous night, cause I kept replaying the second ending in my head over and iver
I swear every 20 something has the same voice now. That is allot creepier than siren head ever could be.
8:30 Now *that's* how you introduce Siren Head
Didn't it say "A SIREN HEAD GAME in 2022?! AND IT'S GOOD?!"?
I kinda curate/suggest games for a streamer friend often -- can anyone tell me what was blurred/cut from the edit around 21:20 and then again referenced at 21:40? Thanks, and, of course, always love your content!
Your editing is possibly the worst. Every interesting part is immediately cut short to a part where us as the viewer have to try and catch up. This is why I’m subscribed to markiplier perhaps
pause at 2:09 - 2:10
This has to be the first game where the wendigo doesn't scare me
Watching this  having midnight snack too
0:21 *Ohio scream*
i was genuinely screaming FOLLOW THE WENDIGO THE OTHER WAY IS WRONG at my monitor
The story is not canon at all, don't be surprised if Henderson gets this taken down.
that scream when you saw him first was great who agree
Ngl that snapshot at 8:55 was insane
is this a remake of that one from a few years ago?
i love that the deers are just going from time to time, "HONK" just randomly and that's just hilarious to me
Siren head is a shape shifter he wasn't always a siren he has changed though out the years and yes this is just the tip of the siren head lore this is much more, I am a siren head fan and I know alot
It is said that Siren Head is 44,000 years old, so most likely he evolved into a siren.
I just realised how similar this is to an older siren head game
The voices that Siren Head plays is a hunting strategy it uses... it plays the voices of loved ones to lure out its next victim, only to repeat the brutal cycle again and again
11:25 Oh? Thanks for the advice, Satan. Appreciate it. I'll be on my way now, dear.
It was the null head
Reminds me of cabelas dangerous hunts.
Thare is one more light head
11:43 did i hear 'one of the friends trevor henderson'? that would be funny
Why is this so fucking scary. Why is this so good?!? I almost never get this scared?,
only true ogs remember when the main character didnt talk
Yall, at 2:05 he yells during the driving scene but I cannot for the life of me see anything, can someone clue me in?
wait a minute is that cougar va voice acting?
IGP scared me more then the actual game 😅
Why 2023 liar
this is probably one of the worst siren head games out here.... The video title is so dumb. The only fact that crouching draws him faster is very stupid, as well as the way the police officer dies and the fact siren head was created in the last 18th in their lore....
Imagine how much the tone of the game would change if Siren Head running on all fours had some goofy cartoon running sound effect
wow that voice acting is awesome
I have never known a form of relief, like the utter relief I get when you're awkwardly scampering around and bumping into corners as that entity is almost AN INCH away from you, and then you finally decide to run into the open door waiting for you. Felt like I just eased myself into a Jacuzzi, while finally unclenching my ass.
Blood covering the seat and steering wheel  Guy: "HUOH, John's truck is wrecked...!!"  I love when great visual games have the most idiotic writers.
When he OHHHHHHHH i had to pause rewind 6 times before i saw it
fun fact i re-wrote the plot of this game in my head for fun bc i thought there was a ton of missed potential. cool little game tho still
Is it just me or does the protagonist sound like Mason from Cod
That voice was not like real siren head voice.that was different
I love when Siren Head said: "It's Sirenin' time, and sirened all over the place
0:00, 3:58, 4:00, 4:02, 4:03, 4:05, 4:30, 4:36, 4:39, 4:46, 4:48, 5:35, 5:37, 6:19, 6:35, 6:44, 7:18, 8:05, 8:07, 8:13, 8:29, 10:27, 10:29, 10:32, 10:33, 10:56, 11:22, 11:24, 11:26, 11:35, 11:37, 11:39, 11:52, 13:50, 13:55, 15:03, 15:06, 15:30, 16:02, 16:05, 16:18, 16:50, 16:52, 17:17, 17:26, 17:30, 17:56, 18:28, 19:45, 20:12, 20:36, 21:00, 21:12, 22:22, 22:24, 23:33, 23:35, 24:44, 24:46, 24:48, 24:50, 24:52, 24:54, 24:56, 24:58, 25:00, 25:02, 25:04, 25:06, 25:08, 26:10, 27:58
Did the ending mean that the protagonist turned into cone head? o_O
the terrible audio of my headphones rn is adding to this a lot
I love your videos
so you cannot go with a car after a specifiek point but your friends have pick ups and campers at there location. what a logic hahahaha
Huh. I'm sure I saw this game before with a pixelated screen effect on top of it. so my guess is that it's either reworked or someone stole the game and called it his own
igp could sell time to a wristwatch
the creature that knocked the protagonist out is an scp I forgot which one though he lives in a forest near a village and people bring food out to him he is always hungry and really skinny with black skin and that deer head
U clean ur shitt!!?
1:30 bru must be ina tesla for him not to be turning the wheel😭😭
I can't tell the difference between your screening and the protagonist.
That wasn't even Siren Head peeking out from the trees in the beginning, just a very giant cryptid and equally as terrifying 😨
Why do you soundtrack so similar to Rick and the main character
Never saw Sirenhead in the Mist movie it will be crazy
igp dead ass sounds like seth rogan ;0
This game is totally awesome,  but unpolished upon blood beng everywhere the narrative igronred it
I don’t get the third ending with that guy? Is that a lore thing or just a mystery
I shit my pants at the start of 5:54
Sometimes I can't tell if the main character is talking or its you talking
Awsome
11:19 the fact that some wendigo motherf**ker came up to you to give you a warning rather than straight up murder and cannibalize you says straight up the kind of force Siren Head really is
Am I the only one who has seen this game before? It's hard to explain, but Markiplier played it. It might be the same game just updated, but I'm not sure. There are some key things about this version that spark my memory.
*me watching this during the dark of Christmas morning*
If it bleeds you can kill it
When the video ends  but u still hear him 💀
Around the heart there all skulls
7:26 I remember jacksepticeye plays this
The fact that a wendigo is telling you to stay away from its woods should be an indication that you should probably, maybe, possibly stay away. Maybe. Its fear overcame its hunger and thats saying something.
As much as I love watching IGP, he could've played this better. Quality content though.
2:15 dawg i think you seeing stuff cause i rewinded like 18 times and didn’t see it 😅
idk but i feel like the siren head is way too fast when its sprinting for its big ahh size dude
this must be a remastered version of that other siren head game
You're such a guy smiley
Who would've thought the Wendigo was just a nice dude.
I didn't know the Wendigo was friends with Siren Head
That was a great advertisement
is it just me or does Freddy sound like cougar macdowall
Fun fact: they tzlk about trevor henderson in the game sometimes, trevor henderson is the creator of all the siren head cryptids and stuff
Love this
"fucking play something sax man!!!"
Sirenhead is such a.... weird... concept. I mean it's a little unoriginal, I actuality think it's a little cheesy. But the games look fun!
i had to pause the video several times to catch my breath even tho im sitting
not scared watching the video;   plays the game;MOMMY11
I really wanna see Markiplier's reaction to warfstache
That wendigo run animation was goofy. Looked like he was skedaddling
I like blood realy like this video
The second I heard the radio guy say where the bridge was I knew that you couldn’t trust him
The amount of typos in the notes is crazy
5:31 the jumpscare: somebody had told...
hello can u play this in multiplayer?
You have a very contagious horror game scream lol I catch myself yelling sometimes when you yell! Loving the playthroughs!
Average ohio national park be like:
yo, Just found you as a youtuber and you make the siren head game funny to watch.
I didn't expect a wendigo to be in the game
So the wendigo isn't aggressive and it's helping like how
wow i just realaised that the gun shot in the beging of the game mite be the frends trying to protec them self
One for Press Start To Laugh, I think.
Pretty good that was a good game like the twist ending with the other monster it's pretty cool and just your sheer reaction to it
tu voz y la del prota suenan muy similares: no tenía idea de quién estaba hablando
Fun fact, Siren Head Was A SCP Before He Was Finally Breached Out By The Chaos Insurgency Then He Continued To Escape, The whole SCP Foundation Nearby Was Nuked And Siren Head Was The Only Survivor So He Killed Every Human Nearby Since He Thinks Humans Are Simply USB's For His Internal DNA.
next game valve head
Are we just going to ignore how th driver able to left and right turn without even moving his hands
the last one is stearing head
Sirens  Head said train Henderson the dude who made the art of sirenhead is named Trevor Henderson get the dots I'm trying to connect the dude you are playing as is his son
Why was that blured
I always wonder with these games what caliber of rifle it is.
So could sired head be considered an scp?? Like, Keter level?
Have you ever played among the sleep? It would super cool, I don’t know where to find it tho maybe it’s still on steam
Can you please play poppyplaytime
This was the best shit i took in my whole life man thx
Crawling siren head is nightmare fuel for me 😂
10:14 why is kakyoin in this game
Beautiful gameplay IGP! New subscriber for you! Last time I watched a different person play this game the game was an older version with only one ending. But watching you getting all three is a 100% the best gameplay walkthrough I've watched! I laughed a lot at this, even your reactions & screams. I become your fan! <3 Keep it up!
PAUSE AT 0:45 AND LOOK TO THE TOP LEFT
Nice aim
At least the Wendigo was being friendly, somewhat
0:45 Oh My God Stevie T
Siren Head is so damn overrated as a creature. and way to ruin the mood by making the game so damn bright even with brightness at intended level, that moon is almost as bright as the sun.
This reminds me of the other siren head game in 2020: The main character ( Freddy ) Siren head crawling  The broadcaster voice siren head emits  The storyline itself   What a wonderful reminder
I missed what happened at 2:09
I thought that this is going to be game that you need like 3 episodes but its only one and its realy short but its ok.  Hope that more games like this come😄
why did u blur the cutscene a little?
siren head in this game is just like "haha you think you can help your friends no just lay down and die"
Bruh
It would be a plot twist if the guy was chosen as his successor, to keep the so called God alive
scream timestamps:  3:41 is the most perfect scream I've ever heard :'D 4:58 okay so IGP just has the best screams in general 8:34  h e  e m e r g e s 16:00  he emerges 2: electric boogaloo
Hands down the worst bolt action animation for a rifle in gaming history.
8:34 Idk why this part made me laugh  hard
what did you see in the beginning?
"damn dude, thats uh" (wendigo noises) "shut up"
why did i watch this at 3am
Little girl: come here! IGP: shut the fuck up That was funny
Chose to give up by standing there and Screaming.
he sounds like alistor from hazbin hotel lol
I almost want to say the thing that spoke to you when you found a body is a skinwalker not a wendigo as skinwalkers look like a wendigo but don’t kill
my theory is the cryptids are neutral for now but its just a theory
I split my toe in two places by stubbing it on a corner while watching this. I blame you IGP >:(
tag @coyrxkenshin
19:00
13:54 I can't stop laughing at the concept of Siren Head saying "Get a load of this guy"
Heyo! My name is Dakota and I'm the voice actor of The Hunter! Thanks so much for supporting our project and giving the game a try! We all worked very hard to make the experience super scary for you!
Did he really just gloss over the shrek meme?
Holy shit the thought of siren head using news reports of someone’s dead friend to taunt them is incredible...such a good use of the concept.
5:58 Looks like you're covered in blood one moment and not the next
I am just purely waiting for one of these new Siren head games have cartoon cat as a possably encountered enemy that is entirely different from Siren head.
Someone should mod choo choo Charles and hello neighbor into this and call it Ohio
only in ohio the game (free trial)
29:12
a siren head :D What the heck guys
Funny thing is when you mentioned about manscape monster patiently  waiting for you to finish 😂
Things are getting freaky in Ohio huh?
Manscaped looking different
Wh were the letters written in the 1790’s and mid-1800’s read like they were from today? That kind of lack of attention to detail is totally avoidable.
Can someone please explain why He had to blur something about a woman and it's ok with the body with the suic note? I mean, what's the difference? Why the first one had to be censored and the second it's ok?
I hate manscaped sponsors "Today we will learn about the decapitated toddler found in a river last week in ohio BUt beFore thAT r Ur ⚾️'s HAirY"
In the final scene of the game when there's that one creature that looks like a cone, does anyone know what it is?
that's Zach from Emkay/ EZPZ
For SIREN HEAD -  8:31
The ice scream was funny
I don’t normally watch this type of thing with games and shit but you are hilarious. You keep me watching with your comments in the game lol.
i think the Wendigo  is supposed to be long horse im making this from the start of video
*ME WITH A M16, FLAMETROWER AND A 357 MAGNUM* FEAR ME YOU LONG NECKED SON OF A BITCH
Maybe he had a giant bell instead of a siren
Seems like an amazing game, although maybe during the siren head attacks they should remove the music . Or add more horrific music. This just made me think of alias for some reason😅
Only in ohio
You nailed the ad.
28:42 Great Value Pyramid Head apparently.
11:21 Bro, why not just explain why instead of show up, say we're not supposed to be here, be vague about why we should leave, and then just exist stage right.
Thank you so much that was really entertaining🤘😎
*Car is filled with blood* Main character: HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS TRUCK BEHIND!
Im so bad with any horror shit and im still watching this... what am i doing
no one: manescape: *we save balls*
I feel like at the beginning they missed out on a 4th joke kind of ending where u get an option to get back into the car and leave 🤔😂
i love how his screams are the things that scare me more than the actual jumpscare. cause ill be watching and i see siren head and i freak out a bit then he screams and almost chuck my across the room  also i love how how near the beginning hes just "its just siren head" that made me laugh a lot.
Everyone here know berleezy played the early version of this game
If I play this game, I probably need more than a hunting rifle.
Looked like an alternate Pyramid Head
You lay down he said if you lay down your choosing to give up, The next you play the game try not to lay down
naw that wendigo needs to shave his balls dawg give him some manscaped
IGP's reactions are the best, the screaming is just a chef's kiss.
Not only Siren Head, but also the most legendary beast ever to cross the mind of man? How can you beat a mind altering Wendigo and a blood frenzied Siren Head?!
I bet IGP wont play a horror game in VR
you chose to give up = you lay down and waited to die like sirenhead told you to
This game changed a HELLA LOT. It looks like an entirely new game, a sequel.
"WE SAVE BALLS" lol
Siren Head crawling will always be goofy to me.
What was that creature at the end before the guy drove away?
this siren head is the tallest siren head i have seen in all sien head games
The voice actor of the main character is Cougar McDowell!!! Or however you spell his name lmao.
Lol sirenhead…so dumb.
I’m pretty sure this game is a revamp of an old game back when siren head became popular
i guess technology is "technically" natural!
ok....real talk here...the car engine sounds in this game sounds like someone is takin a wizz
Why does the character your playing as sound like cougar?
While i was watching this we had a nationwide emergency alert systems test so my phone suddenly started blaring a siren sound. God damn
8:27 the reason i love this channel 🤣🤣🤣
The John Bernthall wait was spot on
IGP’s fight or flight response: fight, then flight
He said he should make his own horror game. He would probably get scared by his own jumpscares😂😂
13:00
This game looks dumb as hell. Like the way siren head chases after you makes me chuckle
I see jack shit at 2:01
See, untill I heard about siren head and all this, I was fine with the dark, and fine with being in a forest alone. I should mention that I have a massively overactive imagination, so now I can't step outside in the dark without thinking there is a fucking demon behind me ready to mutilate my body while I still am awake.
Could’ve sworn I seen this game before?
I love your cinematic reactions! The shaking of the screen when you scream, the focus when you're freaking out, you're just freaking awesome!!!
Never thought a Wendigo would actually try to help you.
god damn the dialogue sucks and it ruins it
It said it's creator name Trevor Henderson 11:43
23:00 "Ooo hoo Jizz"
from 21:40 was she hung? or what
The main character voice is Cougar Machdowall
Thanks Indy I got mine with your code and this thing. . .  . . . ooh gaats its heaven!!
0:35  I like the implication that the deer monster thing is the one presenting the sponsor instead of IGP
So let me guess wendigo and sure head
This game looks beautiful, but there is SO MANY GRAMMATICAL ERRORS!! It annoys me...
screammmmssss are good in horror game
Everyone knows who the voice actor is  👇🏿
“Shut up 😅, I’m mourning my friend”
The way the protagonist doesn't question where the broadcasts are coming from is a bit annoying.
i like this siren head, he got attitude and sass
The last part of the game look like someone from silent hill
i like how theres just a comically large camping stove on the bed of the pickup truck at 5:06
I’m trying to think if it’s a finalised version of that game back in 2018/19 where you go in tower and get the gun then can shoot siren head and he mocks you with your friends voices and screams and tells you to lay down and accept your fate, is this the finished version? I think jacksepticeye played it then
11:16 Wendigos walk is fruity frfr 💅
19:39
27:44 suren head ded
15:25 oh come on , that's just bullshit. you could totally climb that. it really isn't that bad , even a kid could do it. I feel like that was a very lazy way for the developer to make the game uselessly longer
Valvehead
everyone sais to grow up its not scary it is for sure
i loved how he screamed the first time he saw siren head.
There is a good horror game I’d think you’d like. Luto I think it’s called.
the voice acting in this game is killing me bruh💀
oh my god you got cryptids in this bitch too? fuck that
Watching this at 2:30 am. Let’s not get any sleep tonight lol
I noticed at 15:17 when he is going to the voice, it cuts to the bridge and a bullet is used, was there a cryptid there?
Am I the only one who thinks that the deer person is cute?
your not markiplier...
Siren Head is a Sirent not a radio that can make whatever sounds it wants
Poster of Wilfard Warfstache IGP: It's Darkiplier
Why do these games take other random Cryptids that don’t look like they belong in the Siren Head lore rather than getting in contact with Trevor to use some of his other creatures?
When a big fookin demon runs up, tells you shits going down, and then runs away, you should likely listen lol.
17:55 my ass was clenched hard enough to make diamonds
You should play generation zero with icy  again the game has more new stuff such as in a motorcycle, new machine fire bird, and if you go to the Vesslan bunker their is a living human being also you can make experimental ammo from uranium
my theory about pre-siren sirenhead is that it used its mimicry to hunt, but only just so happened to look like a siren to amplify its calls
Goofy ahh voice actor
That scream at 8:35 had me dying
The game uses gravity falls font for the sign
can we appreciate the most appropriate reaction at 8:30
I just imagine there could've been a joke part of this game where siren head starts talking like a TV show host whilst chasing you, just something stupid like "Spin the wheel and see how astronomically screwed you are!"
“Get a load of this guy”, Siren head 2022
Dude his scream is so funny I can’t stop laughing 😂
Still disappointed that there is no good game of Cartoon Cat !
Wilford Warfstache, not Darkiplier
Glad you play it and not me.
ITS THE GHOST OF VALVE
If this was on console, for sure we’d all buy in a heartbeat
Voice acting is surprisingly good
if siren head moved at least 10x slower than this it would be way more terrifying
I would've shot myself if I realised I was in that situation after I saw Siren Head fr.
15:33 wen the music gets intes it means he is coming
I hope long horse is in this game
Not only that siren head is hella terrifying you gotta deal with windegos and ski walkers hell nah  Game still good tho  Edit: Take it in that the windego warns you to leave because of sirenhead 😳😳
3:14 gout (not goat)
Isn't this just the last game but on Unreal engine?
They should use you for horror voice over you sound more scared than everyone
Thanks for the fun! ^^
You know that you're in something serious when you're asking the _Wendigo_ of all creatures to stay with you.
Sirenhead, are you good?  OOOOOAAAAAAHHHH
I can't help but feel that we must be getting poorer video quality than IGP was getting in game. That first scream around 2:10 came roughly 3 seconds before anything odd was visible in the video.
The deer sounds like a otomaton
7:32 Both wrong. That is Wilford Warfstache. He's a reporter. He also used to have an afro.
You cannot escape
That rifle only having one lens cap really bothers me. Lol
Does anyone else besides me notice that the speedometer and tachometer dont have dials?
How evil do you have to be to the point the scary ass cryptids would try to help you escape and warn you
Stop promoting shitty games because they pay you. This game sucks.
Aside from being confused at least the only person left survived who killed the friends siren head or the other monster.
11:18, if anyone is wondering what the Random Wendigo is saying here; "Heretic! You should not be here, leave at once! The longer you stay, the worse _he_ becomes...."  Also, WHY IS THERE A RANDOM TALKING WENDIGO???
Siren head: *plays a cheery scary siren sound*  Me: he’s an ice cream truck!
Mortuary assistant next??
This is quite literally EXACTLY the same as the sirenhead game by undreamedpanic.
So this game is just a rehash of another game just.... Better?
That map is a game from Roblox that I used to love and play
lame pretty much a reskin of theat one old game that has the same options
6:39
I love when he screamed !
8:14
1:25  honestly I would like a game like this  basically The Long Drive but you're a passenger
Valve head.
Im so tired, i thought the ficking title was "(…) AND ITS GOOFY"
Your average day in Ohio
Bro forgot Trevor literally said siren head can control radio’s there was no police officer
8:46 My guy, that cut was like turning the corner and finding yourself in a different timeline. Too clean lol
Why does it remind me of roblox siren head ☠️ (haven't played roblox in years so idk if its still thete)
Dude you're the best!!! You're videos are amazing! I love all your horror game videos AND the best part of these videos are your screams and comments 🤣🤣🤣 I really love these screams! Keep doing the great work! Really entertaining!
He sounds like a Young Markiplier, his scream is almost on point with Marks
I LOVED YOUR PLAYTHROUGH! Thanks for playing my game again! Made my day!!
The rubberbanding sound effect oml
The elk? Caribou?? Deer? The creature going "behhhhh" first scared me, and then made me crack up when you "behhh"ed back
I don't think Sirenhead has any official lore, the only thing all stories have in common are the monster itself, some forest/park in North America  and people disappearing, all the rest is free game.
0:19 "dynamic interaction" bruh sirenhead do be skedaddlin
"JEEEEEEZZUUUUUUSSS!!" 😂😂🤩
Better than the giant hunting game cuz it actually has enjoyable animations.
finally a game that doesnt depict its monsters as infallible. also wheelhead??
Him trying to be kid friendly be like:
2:08 Bro I've watched this over and over trying to figure this out. What happened???
That scream is hilarious
That was actually a missing persons report on Wilford Warfstache.
Evans is that just on the thumbnails what the f*** is that to where to kill it with fire and go to church for real
I'm sorry, but I simply despise the interpretation that Siren Head is a crawler. In no way should he be a crawling creature. When I first saw that I laughed out loud, it wasn't scary but hilariously stupid. Siren Head is born from the concept of a siren on a pole screaming its warnings of danger. It is meant to be mistaken as that, not a dog. It is meant to be slow, intelligent, and noticeable only when one is close enough to realize that it is shambling towards them ominously bellowing its siren call.
The cop didn't lie to you. Sirenhead was broadcasting through the radio to you. There never was a cop.
2:07 yes, I see a shadow of a tree. I literally went frame by frame, the only thing there is the shadow of a tree.
that's some music man fight ost right there
So did the protagonist just forget he had a perfectly running car?
I'm so confused right now it says this video was posted 2 days ago but this comment was posted 3 days ago my brainnnnn. YouTubers being weird again
Was that the Wendigo ? Wtf
This game looks nearly identical to one I saw a while ago, dialog, locations, weapons, but the only difference was no cryptids and only 1 ending.
Is the main character voiced by cougar
It always starts on a damn camping trip
0:38 Average Manscaped user
As much as I liked this game, I must say that siren head is one of the most silliest creatures I've heard of.
I’m so happy to finally have faster internet speeds so now I can watch all of IGP videos in higher resolution then 360. I CAN FINALLY SEE EVERYTHING
What is that notdeer doing there before the sponsor announcement. I want to see more of him! (Also mistaken for wendigo.)
The scream on the driving scene at the start.. I rewinded like 6 times and can’t see anything where the heck is it
Skinwalkers, Wendigos, Siren Head? What else is next?
I forgot how scary this mf is
I am facepalming so hard
😉👍👍👍
The wendigos running animation had me dying 😂
Cougar is actually an amazing voice artist! You guys should totally check him out
Since when does siren head allow other creatures in his territory?
12:35 i think they people that turn maybe the the siren dna dont mix well with our
8:33 almost died
This game has promise but it's no where close to Sirenhead: Resurrection. That game has so many more elements to it including survival mechanics, a large open world, time changes, and a much longer story. This game is more of an open walking sim with a bit of Slenderman: The 13 Pages at the end. It's got pretty graphics and actually voice acting but lacks polish and substance. I do think it does well to raise the bar for the baseline standard in indie horror games these days.
i think i know what siren may be it may been make for tree growing it use sound to increase tree grow make by a mad man the fog is water it let out and it make by the gov it likely eat fertilizer but one day a bug strom like back in the great depression bug attack got too many in it now it eat human because they taste good to it all who knew about it die
someone... try and trick marki to be subjected to play it without knowing what it is beforehand if its a new good siren head game ...that could be a nice way to round of 2022 after all XD
It's been so long.
I like how the Wendigo just comes out to help him. It is unlike every story I’ve heard, and I like it!
like how nhe runs toward the sound once
A wendigo helped with a tip
7:35  That's Warfstache 😭😭😭
The existence of Sirenhead before sirens indicates an older, more powerful Sirenhead...  Gramophonehead.
Haven't you played this game before? Obviously there's more content since last time, but I find it odd you didn't mention playing this before at the beginning of the video.
Okay but can we just talk about how that wendigo was lowkey being a homie and warning ya to run for it? Didn't have to, coulda just mauled you, instead he up and said "Ay bro, get out, man's bad news."
Player character sounds like an English dub shonen anime VA but pretty cool game nonetheless.
Damn... The monster roasted him
This is fckin terrifying
the rear view mirror of the car at the beginning is smack dab in the middle of the wind shield
5:05 - “Johns truck is wrecked! He’d never let this happen!”
I love this game!
at 21:23 why was it censored?
i love how you cant tell if its the main character talking or IGP
Wasn't paying attention and suddenly heard him say "that's not Kirkland" and had to double take. I've never seen my name used in a video game before so that was kind of jarring.
So what happens if you give up in a building?
4:02 to 4:05 this is why your the best!!!Lol love ya IGP!!
When the imposter is sus
I've been scrolling YouTube for over 25 minutes, and you IGP, you just saved me from boredom, Thank you! 🙏
Cant choose international countries for the Manscape pack.
WAIT @CougarMacDowall VOICED THE MC NO WAY
You need to try the Siren Fred game. It's super scary
Idk what it's called but the last being u see in the game has a coil starting a new siren look at it close ull see it
5:57 when he moves into the shadow, it oddly makes it look like his hand and gun suddenly became caked in blood
If I remember correctly weindigo and siren head do have similar powers.
I feel like this is a remastered version of a sirenhead game from awhile back (The "do it and find out" line confirmed it for me)
Ever heard of aiming in…? You aren’t the smartest.
17:40 Not getting caught and desensitized makes it much more terrifying. More games should just let the player be scared of getting caught rather than actually catching them.
yes more siren head please
You know you're in trouble when a WENDIGO gives you advice.
28:33 VALVe
4:57 set the tone for the video
I actually die of laughter everytime you scream XD like why does it catch me off guard everytime?
God the car sounds so good. It sounds kinda like a cammed SBC 350. Odd that they chose it for the car but im definitely not complaining
bro.. as always.. I'm more in shock because of your scream than the game jumpscare.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
shiiiiiiiiiiit he caught me stalking him in the woods
IGP the main character you playing as the voice actor sounds familiar does it not sound familiar to you.
I could die if i played this game
So… he doesn’t even look for the rest of his friends? He just leaves despite thinking the danger is gone and the clearly dangerous wendigo thing still around who isn’t likely to be too happy with his actions
I like that it does messages instead of just noises, way creepier.
The Cryptids are looking for Gnome Chompski lol
why did you have to blur the woman?
Literally cult of the cryptids on roblox
Ah yes. "Dynamic Interactions". My favorite.
Your screams make this so much more enjoyable XD
0:19 scp-096 moment
I’ma be real, saw nothing at 2:08 i think your just jumpy lol
At the end was the famous cryptid, Steering Wheel-Cone-Head!
Well that was nice of the Wendigo
"I love driving at night. I love not being able to see anything." I love that I am unable to turn the steering wheel yet my car follows the road perfectly. Ah, the pinnacle of self driving technology in this clearly early to mid 1980s era. I think I'll leave my car running when I get to the campsite's parking area. Gas prices are still quite reasonable, after all. And if my friend's car interior is drenched in a red looking fluid that might be blood, well I'll just choose to ignore that. I'm sure it'll be fine.
Oh man I could nerd out soo much about the Markiplier references and if it was ever made canon what it'd mean...
That reaction at 2:07 was just priceless
This Feels similar...
The back of the criptid at the end has a steering wheel on it's head.  You could assume that the ending is suggesting that the cult of siren head is going to use your car to spread criptids and find the other siren heads
"I love driving in the pitch black darkness of night" says mr. main character as Gods flashlight illuminates everything.
I remember this game just being a demo, now it’s fully flashed out
Did... did the mother fucking Wendigo just warn you about Siren Head then peace out? LMAO
I got my hubby manscaped for christmas a while back and he absolutely LOVES it!   Now this game, wow. I'm glad to see Sirenhead some more!
You are my favorite youtuber ❤
“SHUT UP!!….. I’m mourning my friend!…………….. …..:….poor bastard…”
Back then when slenderman was popular, now it's siren head and the backrooms
It's simple: If you know how to do it, it will be good and never die. Like Rick Rolling :v
JESUS 👁️👁️👃👁️👁️ 🙏
gotta love the doom eternal reference though lol
At 6:40 Was that the rake??
We couldn't see Siren Head's heart because of your screaming. 😅 But great edit nonetheless, Skilly. But it's nice to see this game again, and they've definitely added more to it. It feels a lot more fleshed out.
There is a OG game source for this game. This is like some remastered version of a game called Siren Head. Mark played it some years ago. You can find other YouTubers who played the OG game.
Manscape really wants YouTube viewers to have smooth balls
The Wendigo telling you to leave to save you from Sirenhead is pretty cool
Oh wow, i remember when you played this game 2 years ago, it really has changed a lot since then.
I tell YouTube to "Don't Recommend This Channel" every time I hear someone say, "God, damn it." One day, you'll wonder why He damned you. And if you don't care about a higher power or don't believe in one, then the word "God" shouldn't exist in your vocabulary. After I'm finished watching this NOW RUINED video of yours, I'm reporting the video, and blocking you.
Love when IGP plays games like this. Thank you IGP
"If you'd been there, you might have saved them. It's just Siren Head." If it's *just* Siren Head then why would I need to be there? They couldn't handle it?
The fact that I know the voice actor for the main character is rather surprising for me as I didn't think they would go into games, they normally just do comics and stuff like that along with a few animation series.
Dude stop yelling at shadows. That's annoying not engaging
This was a lot better than previous Siren Head games. The core issue is still that if you stay inside, you're safe. Having more cryptids to force you outside would make it more engaging I feel.
11:26 DID HE JUST SPEAK?!!!
I'm 8 minutes into the video. I'm really hoping that I don't see The Grafton monster. It's extremely unlikely due to it being a West Virginia Crypt near a town called Grafton. Yes, I learned this Crypt from Fallout 76. Although, they do typically have real Crypts in their games.
SIRENHEAD JUST SPRINTING AT YOU ON ALL FOURS IS HORRIFYING. PLEASE, NO.
I was just thinking about watching something about Siren head, how convinient
Could you imagine that the creature at the end was Pyramid Head before it was placed in the pyramid trap thing.
Oh no… Valve Head.
manscape is shit 🙄
Wendigo- dude get in your car and leave Protagonist- hmmm radiø go brrrrrr
I love how mr main character is so oblivious he left his car running, he’s never gonna financially recover from that
8:31 can we just appreciate IGP's sick noscope on siren head?
lol, i heard the character's voice and immediately went "COUGAR???" i knew he was a VA, but i'd never heard him in anything before! i'm 99% sure it's cougar anyway, but i can't find any credits for this game Anywhere :/ and i'm not used to him sounding so serious, lol
The fact you called Wilford "Motherlovin" Warfstache Darkiplier hurt me a bit lol
THIS WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO WATCH WHILE WRITING A PAPER!!
The amount of anxeity IGP had when the icecream music started playing o my god
Oh hey, its that death vfx.
DEATH: psst hey c'mere  IGP: UGH SO TEMPTING. *Proceeds to walk towards it* *DIES*  IGP: what I gave up? How? What?  I'm sorry but am I the only one confused on how he can be so stupid sometimes?
Who's the valve dude at the end? I wanna read up on it
This needs more likes 👍
2:08 Bro, how? How can you even see anything when you yelled? I only say a squatting shape at 2:11
The sad this about being a small YouTuber is that no one cares to watch my videos.I uploaded a playthrough of the same game and I put so much time into editing and it does bad because I'm a nobody.
You know, that was the first sponsor I sat through I think xD
i swear to cthulhu, i keep seeing manscaped ads on tumblr and on tiktok and everywhere else. if it starts advertising in my dreams, im gonna mutate into a gibbering monstrosity. at least we know why sirenhead is so squeaky clean, though.
Man...this Wendigo sure does talk a lot
*That wendigo told you to leave because the longer you stay the worse he gets what a king*
I know it's silly to say this, but the most unbelievable part of this game is the two Hilleberg tents that we see in the campsite at the start. No way your average college age kid could justify buying one of those, much less two.
Do your ears hang low? Do they wobble to and fro? Can you tie 'em in a knot? Can you tie 'em in a bow? Can you throw 'em o'er your shoulder Like a Continental Soldier? Do your ears hang low?
Windego to Siren head:  “Wanna do a co-op bruh?”
the brodcast speaker reminds me of Cave Johnson from Portal 2
Man's looked like smeagle
My son created sirenhead. He has a deal with a production company to make a film. Look up Trevor Henderson’s work.
Play the store is closed
I remember me watching these years ago, brings back some cool vids and memories
2:08 yes indie. That's a tree!🤣
i also liked how sirens head height is more accurate since he is 40 feet tall in the other game it looks like he is more of around 20 feet
I remember seeing the old version of this game years again, and seeing updated to an more polish and unique, having more story in, better animation with siren head, better graphics, and proper voice acting. It has come long way, and the developer should be proud to make the best siren head game
Bro they really got the valve head guy in the end credits
i thought this was a movie at first imagine games in 2040-50
Dude leaves his car on in the middle of the woods that's the most next level escape shit ive ever seen! Or developers' oopsie 👀
IGP: my friend is dead  Wendigo: hey bro you gotta like get out of here the man gets worse the more you stay
Ah yes. “Siren Head lore.” Yes, the lore from a drawing with almost no description.  (Original artist: Trevor Henderson)
What did he see I cant really see it???
Why does the deer sound like they used otomatones for their sounds?
this was not Darkiplier, it was Wilford Warfstache XD
I'm pretty that's Wilfred warfstache actually...
I know people can sound alike but that sound like a person who dubs Godzilla comics the character you at as
IGP's screams never get old.
Great video.
I gotta be honest, I did not in fact, see anything at the beginning lol and I rewound it!
Technically there are cave paintings of Siren Head that are ancient, so yes, Siren Head existed in the 1800s.
bro the bolt action cycles like a straight pull even thought it doesnt look like it 💀
Guys, have IGP play'd Silent Hill? Can't find a playlist...
I know how you're being paid to advertise and you're just doing your job but all of us know manscaped is just dropshipped and not good for you at all
Igp  I don't know if this is true for all cryptids, but not all cryptids are good and siren head is also a cryptid.
That rifle is a bolt-action but the action used by the player is for a semi-auto slide.
I watched multiple playthroughs of this one before, but has updated so much it is completely different. Honestly, I hope the old version still exists too since it was already pretty good
Is this updated from the one that Markiplier and jacksepticeye played before? The one that had a bit of a CRT monitor Vision screen?
Anyone notice how the Officer said "You and your friends" when the protagonist never said anything about being with other people?
The fact that you cant show a body hanging on YouTube is kinda weird to me, yet dead bodies and human remains on the ground are just fine?
Play war of the worlds next please
super merci !
I imagine in the 1700’s version of Siren Head is Bell Head 😂
The protagonist's voice sounds a lot like cougar
whens the next signal simulator episode?
Oh god that game is horrifying just watching the playthrough!
I cant believe that after a few years of Siren Head being a dead thing, there are still things like this
Can someone please inform me as to what he couldn't show at 21:39 ?
this guy is annoying
Never would I imagine that a Wendigo would stop and give you a warning to leave instead of eating you on the spot
Cann you pley Discofer the ocean
Did anyone else notice that he was turning on the road in the beginning, without ever moving his hands? Maybe the MC was a cryptid the whole time? Or an SCP?
I love the VA; Cougar is one of my favorite meme narrators too!
"Wt- what the fuk is that?"  My best guess, Wheelhead 👌
Just bought Platinum Package 4.0 with your code, thanks man! My balls thank you! XD
I love the scream like seriously
The scream when the game lagged had me in stitches🤣
Can’t wait for “Valve head” next!
23:45 actually siren head has existed ever since the stone age, although it's species were wiped out My theory is that this specific siren head just evolved over time
I watched someone play this already, but you make me laugh so I watched yours!!!!
THE AD TRANSITIONS KEEP GETTING BETTER
The siren head game franchise just resurrected a bit , didn't it?
Isn't this a remake to the other Sirenhead game? It also had a lay down to give up button. They made it even better though and gave it an extra ending! I hope we get more horror games from this developer.
The sentrys have come
What was at 2:08-2:10? IGP reacted but I have no clue as to what, I don't see anything.
Wonder if they’ll make a sequel for Standpoint. Lot of depth in this game and has potential.
I’ve always wondered what would happen if you laid down in the bunker or watchtower
I hate that the protaagonist just leaves his car running
The first siren ever made was invented in 1819 by the French engineer and physicist Charles Gagniard. Tho those dates still don't match still, he did start the project in 1777 and it became used by all in 1859. The more you know 🌈
That Scream tho😂🤣💀 8:34
I think it's apart of the lore but idk if you aswell but when i heard the timeline is out of order I looked it up     "Siren head is 44000 years old as depicted in cave paintings"
Ain't even back from dimensions-(redacted info ) and this drops in , nice IGP
IGP I would love if you would make a horror game
i guess the wendigo guy just walks up to you and gives you a warning? what a nice fella.
Was that Obama on the radio radio Man sound like Obama my fellow American get to the bridge we will help you
Was that the wendigo or the skinwalker that told you hey get the f*** out of this for she's going to get worse that man was letting you know
I love the use of the wendigo. XD
Just started the video, does he know about "Not Deer"?
Love your vids
10:14 is that a Jojo's reference?
thie animations are goofy. but amazing
Dunno about good, but looks fun.
19:41 Jump scare
8:31 can we just appreciate IGP's sick noscope on siren head?
Monster: "BRRRRRAAAAAAAAWWWWWWRRRRR!!"  IGP: "Shut up...I'm morning my friend..."
I didn't even see the first one he talked about while driving
I love igp and this little community we got, but honestly I've grown tired of all the fake screaming and fake authentic jump scares.
yo that start jingle came from the game walking zombie 2 XD
Trevor Henderson has actually left a lot of info on siren head, it's why he sticks out over his other creations simply because he has been posted multiple times and people like him
The wendigo just reminding you to get out of the park and running away like   Get out the park the more you stay the more angrier he becomes  Skeletor will be back for more spooky facts 🏃‍♂️
The voice sounds like crugermcva
Big horrific goatman: "Do you take care of your balls?"
You know, for a weird ass goat/dear monster that cryptid was speaking some facts. Just leave? Honestly if I saw a giant radio skinny man trying to attack me I'd just get outta there
They made Siren head more terrifying than before.
IGP is cute        Also nice shot
IGP, this could most definitely be a series if it's good enough, if it becomes a series do you think it'd become a console game, I most definitely feel like it should.
Wow. This game sure got a big update since I last saw it. It looks great.
woow..just..the ending was the msot compelling part...man I lvoe games with creepypastas and/or creepytides!
“Did you see that” no…no I did not 😢
Wait, is the Sirenhead voice Dark Somnium? They just sound so similar 😭
These games could be good, but these developers need a bit of patience. Things go from 0 to 100 way too fast lol.
Wendigo: *enters building* IGP: *IT’S MANSCAPING TIME*
28:48 Wheel Head, the long awaited sequel
Wait this was JUST posted? Okay then! Love your vids IGP! They help keep me entertained and ironically sleep at night. Thank you for entertaining us with the horror and scares! Happy holidays to you and the family!
23:40 I'm afraid they reverse-engineered sirens FROM Siren Head. Although the term, "reverse-engineered ", doesn't quite cut it in this case. It's more like they "imitated" it.
They kinda copied stuff from other siren head game (siren heads lines, story of this game, etc.)
21:52 at least describe to us what you can't show 🥺
Valve Head confirmed!
if war of the worlds (yes, based on the movie) releases i would like to see you play it (currently its in closed beta)
19:22 deja Vu? Oh wait this is based off the other game haha, though the newest thing about this is the addition of new cryptids into the lore.
18:05 even without a brain he's smart LOL. And his senses are super.
15:15 the voice acting is awesome LOL 😂👌
17:23 Fug bro you scared the fecal matter out of me
Gasped seeing the Wendigo! I love them
12:42 "maybe they're being cryptic now cuz they're cryptids"  Like that new(kinda) conjuring game? Was it conjuring? It was based off a horror movie. I think H20 delirious played it.
Weird there's different cryptids along with siren head, don't like that, too much competition and kind distracts from the main Villain.  11:35 nevermind...it seems Wendigo is or has become subservient to Siren Head, gives me newscapepro vibes ( an ancient Minecraft YouTuber who did roleplays on cryptids, pretty good actually, sad he deleted his videos ) also his "sexy walk" is hilarious 😂👌
8:31 I am scared 😬
I kinda wanna see you play Cult of the Cryptids on Roblox, ik its a roblox game but the lore is pretty good, and theres tons of cryptids
News just blaring across the forest and protag doesn't even question it.
6:06 that's one of the things why I love siren head, the whole news and voices immitation Lol, reminds me of the nuclear remix for 28 weeks later music.
That boi scuttlin
Dude, indeed was a great Sirenhead piece alright. Honestly think it’s my favourite Sirenhead game so far out all that exists. The game was truly very satisfyingly made.
Markiplier needs to play this, it may never happen tho :(  I’ll keep waiting tho :)
I love the there's one alarm is in Henry stick min collection
Igp you should try, Siren Head:retribution (unless you’ve done it before and I’ve missed it)
That thing at the end was the road kill god. I forgor the lore about him. Also in most universes about siren head they are a species, but most probably died since they had no sacrifices
I love how good igp's eyes are I Can't see the things that he sees
I like these graphics, so perfect for the game
The lower the sound the closer
Youtube is a p*ssy if you have to blur sexual content. Thats why i prefer to use odysee--censor and law-free
Didn't I already see this game some time ago? It was probably a demo
2:06 IGP is loosing it, I slowed the video to 0.25 and the only thing I see is a lens flare. IGP you have to let go, the accident wasn't your fault.
I agreed to Siren Head! I didn't agree to other cryptids!
8:33 That scream is legendary 🤣
The weird sound in the beginning when you get out if your car is a buck or doe  grunting. When they do it in the wild it's just as hilarious sounding lol
I've never heard of you but you have over 2mil subscribers.
wow this game has improved drastically since I last saw it lmao and that was years ago
Ha! You can’t fool me siren head! I KNOW there’s no ice cream trucks in the woods!
@21:42 what couldn't IGP show in YouTube?
What was blurred out
looks like hints of a next game. looking forward to it
OK... now what!? Valve Head the Horror Game!?
NAWHHHHH wendigo runs sturdy tho ☠️🚶🤡😫📢✌
Ay that noscope on the siren head was pretty faze of ya
I love your videos keep up the great work your my favorite youtuber
I miss your oldschool intro music :( Almost 5 years now since you used it.
It was good to see you "getting back to the basics".
IGP: “Did you see that?!?!?”   Me: “no”
5:14 yea, you out of all people know best what can be in water
This man teached me its ok to scream like a girl respect
damn, too new of a vid i can't check for the most replayed sections so that i can prepare for jumpscares
Yoo what did see because the zoomed in on it and couldn't see anything i think you saw a tree
I keep missing the videos being put on 😭 I hate timezone differences
Irl=in real life (SIREN HEAD) = ITS LIKE GOING NUCLER TO HIDE OR SOMETHING DEATH VIRUS ETC..
If the screen is in the corner it can't hurt me if its in the corner it can't hurt me
I played these game and im glad they added where if you shot siren head he will get stun some part don't like the chase
I love the scream hip fire shot at siren head lol
Thank you for your content IGP!  Always brighten up the mood over here! Much luv from germany! 💚
Guys, is siren head your favorite trevor henderson creature?
Sometimes when ya screaming IGP, I have kinda feeling like to hear Markiplier.
So the cult is called the order ? And the thing at the end ? The shape of its head and the way it walks? Pyramid head? That’s 100% silent hill references! That makes me think, what if the guy you’re playing as actually did kill his friends in the past and was led back to these woods to face sirenhead and be punished for his sins 🤔
I saw what was in the beginning but I couldn’t tell what it was… any idea what it was
Yo I swear I just saw  the  best siren head game ever 10 months ago  And after that I saw this !
Speaking of siren head resurrection… *IGP 🙃*  *w h e n i s t h e s e c o n d* *p a r t c o m i n g o u t . . . ?*
Seem like the second game will be about wheel head😅
Since when is manscapes new RAID SHADOOOW LEGEENDS?  i wonder
Now you get to defeat the Valve Supremacy 😈
That VA sounds suspiciously like someone I know on EZPZ
5:32 shrek reference from the movie 1
Skip the first  1:24 to game play.
the chase to teh factory was to intens
So this is clearly an updated version of a previous Siren Head Game - neato! I like the added material.
Such a coincidence I’ve been watching your old videos of playing Siren Head fan games. And now you make a new upload on one. Hahah. This is awesome by the way, I love your content :) I’ve always loved cryptid games. This game reminds me of cult of the cryptids on roblox. Really good game. Me and my friends bossed through that game a lot. It was really fun times
IGP screams gets me 😂
I love how the protagonist completely ignored the fact that his friends cars driver seat was covered in blood
Once I was with a friend at a campfire and in the forest we heard the sound of an ice cream truck. I still don't know what it was
But isn’t that Wilford warstache not darkiplier lmao ..
Cougar macdowall as the your character, never would of guessed that they would hire comic dubbers on youtube to do voice lines.
I have just realised that this game is almost a complete remake of a another siren head game which is just called siren head and IGP has played that game before I think.
Siren Head sounds like it has been to Aperture Labs, and ate Cave Johnson
i  remember the meme in manscaped the balls
bro entered ohio
10:14 that's fucking Kakyoin from JJBA
thank you for video,  always fun to watch😄
I'm pretty sure I saw the demo for this awhile back
"oooohhh did you see that" No, cause it was a tree
this looks... familliar
That 1st death was terrifying!
7:35 that's wilford wurfstace
19:39 | The way he walked towards you tho, very sassy, he just casually crushes the cop cruiser while doing so, this is hilarious.
this video has been out for 25 minutes and it already has 6.8k likes its so crazy how big a supportive community can be love your vids keep it up
Déjà vu.
That wendigo told you to leave because the longer you stay the worse he gets what a king
I love how IGP screams
I like the fact they did a whole lot more with this game.   One suggestion tho...........I would get rid of the chase music.  Really lean into those unnerving silences.....unsettling stomping sounds just barely in earshot.......and most importantly REALLY use that warning sound. Get an audio person and REALLY have fun with it. A siren noise is ULTRA UNSETTLING and shit yourself Fear inducing if you do it right.   The other reason to get rid of it, it blairs over where the player would be listening for footsteps. Giving the player the option to listen for that would add to the carnal panic of trying to get away. Making the player fight almost like an animal to use every instinct and resource they can to get away from the danger is good ass game design.
Wait...”You were tricked”? By what? The game? When this ending was looming, I thought that the police lights would suddenly start rising into the air, and we’d see that Sirenhead could mimic the red-and-blues of a police cruiser.   But instead, he just arrives, steps on what was apparently the real and active police cruiser (which was making both the lights AND the sound), and then...what? The game says “You were tricked”? Again, by what?   The police radio call _did_ sound mad suspicious, and by that point we had seen really clearly that Sirenhead could impersonate human voices as well as make them sound like they were coming through a radio.   There was no trick. Acting like it was a trick is stupid, unless the ‘trick’ is that...Sirenhead knew where you were going? At which point, what the hell is the trick?   Bleh. It irks me a lot like how the ‘lie down and find out’ ending happens if you just crouch. Like, if there was a mechanic that allowed you to, say, go prone, then okay. But is the dev really trying to act like the natural instinct to be stealthy in a survival horror game is the same as ‘You have up’?  Clearly a lot of work went into this, but much like the clumsy VA work during the investigation bit not at all matching with the things you find (Really? Astonished that your brother ‘abandoned’ his truck after a crash...and not commenting on the buckets of blood in the driver seat, or now it’s now in the lake?), this game feels like it needed just a _bit_ more polish to really stand out. The main VA sounds like a pro, but also one that didn’t have the visuals in front of him, the extra endings feel slipshod at best and ‘meh’ at most, and there are lapses in writing and scripting that drag a player out of the story (“This wasn’t on the map.” (‘I have a map?! Wait, I don’t have a map.’))  Still, I remember how a lot of games that IGP has covered got some additional life in them development-wise, so maybe this rough-cut gem will get a proper chance to shine.
Now that you finished Southpoint: Siren head! Are you ready for Southpoint: Valve head??
Dude ur such a wimp with horror games it’s funny
Idk this one didn't seem high quality at all just kind of shitty overall
Can you please grow up or stop doing the fake screams
Wendigo with that sassy ass walk wft 0:35
Is the VA cougar it sounds just like him
Got scared by the rubberbanding hahaha! But no hard feelings, I've been spooked by them too, especially in tense moments
I like a nice indie game like this
I like how the ending part were you're about to drive away just gave out some silent hill vibe because of the unknown figure that was just staring at you as you drove away so basically there's 3 entity in total
Siren-head is kinda..
Where’s signal sim 2.0 😂 not to be a dick here for siren head but can’t wait for aliens 👀👀
The voice acting of the MC is on point
Something tells me the nightmare is not over ..
We need a bigfoot style siren head game, that would be f-ing AWESOME
Make sense that markiplier is in there he played the game 2 years ago
i love this game so much. the execution of sirenhead talking to the protagonist is so perfect, i just love it. 13:47 is such a perfect, amazing, and memorable moment.
This game isnt from 2020??
Why is siren head so damn fast Gah damn man drank 293 red bulls and 23 punds of cocaine wtf
Hallo
Lol the ending when he tries to figure out what that thing was
Where the fuck you been?
U should also try out "Project: Playtime" created by the same developers of Poppy Playtime, early access in steam for free.
This siren head rendition is massive.
Sirenhead feels weirdly sassy
That.... was.... AWESOME!
17:46 THE AUTO CAPTIONS SAY APPLAUSE WHEN HE SCREAMS
Still, it's like a good review. You would blow their socks off as a game spot reviewer. (or whatever the big game review site is)
In the end be like Cryptids: Ight sirenhead is dead, let's make this area Silenthill instead
Would siren head before the first siren be using like church/town bells?
The voice of that voice actor sounds familiar
this was amazing, especially adding the wendigo and other new cryptids to interact with this lore. definitely see room for them to build on this and expand to investigations and fights of other cryptids
Good lord, when you were running from Siren Head and quick shoting him I was holding my breath hoping you'd outrun him.
That thing with the deer skull head was definitely not what he thought it was. I’m a bit hesitant to talk abt this, because I’ve heard Indigenous people talk about how some media featuring those creatures are just cultural appropriation. But I think it should be said that it looked to be some other kind of cryptid, or possibly an original concept made by the devs. I think people should be more conscious of keeping cultures in mind when talking about cryptids. It’s easy to just rehash a creature from a culture’s mythology to turn into a creepy pasta, but if you think about it, it’s a little ridiculous to do that, and I think people get offended by it. Just wanted to say this bc I didn’t see any other comments about it. If any Native people want to talk about this, seeing as they will probably be able to explain if and why it’s offensive to use that specific creature in certain ways, I’d like to hear opinions!
cryptic cryptids is a good tongue twister
Neat thumbnail, reminds me of my ex
"THATS GOT TO BE HIM" igp looking at a lighting orb which are very much a real thing that we have no idea what causes them
Boy,  your character is a winey biotch. I think he had bigger problems then the dark.  Like his instrument cluster has no working gages and he doesn't seem to have a windshield since his tape recorder would be sticking through it.  Just saying.  😉
23:02 ooOoooh JIZZ!
Haha! Never thought it would come back!      *Like this comment bish you won't*
Lets……GOOOOOOO
Will Voice of the Voud come back? I've bewn waiting for an episode 2 :(
I love the design of whatever that thing at the very end is. Is that another one of Trevor's monsters, or is it unique to this game?
I love sirenhead!
every day i pray igp uploads faster why does god ignore me
Bruh I'm not getting shit from Manscaped until I see a manhood & asshole combo kit promoted.
I love how speechless you became when the Wendigo spoke to you after finding John. Felt like I could hear you processing what the fuck just happened lmao
You know what would be cool?  Getting a Long Horse cameo in one of these games.  Picture this: the main character has a horrifying dream featuring a skeletal horse/thing, with flashes to later points of the game.  The character wakes up, is shaken up by the dream, but chalks it up to just being a weird dream.  The character goes about their day, but begins to get Deja Vu from things happening around them.  If the player catches on and avoids those situations, maybe it can be used to make the game slightly easier at the start/give the character more warning/time to prepare?  it'd be cool for a first time player experience, though maybe the dreams could flash different points of the game for replay ability.   If you read to the end of this thanks!  Have a cookie!
Campsite covered in blood, "Did a bear do what???" ...so desensitized :P
(2:08) Jesus christ. WTF are you screaming at??? Ugh. It sucks so bad that it's so cool that you show so many interesting indie games with promise that might not otherwise get exposure, yet you constantly yell and scream at the most innocuous things and sometimes even nothing at all. Like, a leaf might blow out and you're all like "YAAAAAAAAA! Did you see that?! Did you SEE THAT?!?!?! I can't believe I just saw that!!!" Christ, man. Just chill TF out. Let the game speak for itself. Probably the best of one of your videos was the last half of the most recent video you did on The Trench. You hardly talked and I actually (for once) actually got a little freaked out. Shit, you've got 2.5 million subscribers, but your comment sections rarely reflect an equivalent level of engagement. Let's do the math... Maybe, just maybe, you're getting all of those subs because you are showcasing unknown games, but maybe, again, just maybe, you're FREAKING ANNOYING PEOPLE with your inane artificial screams and caterwauling as you play. Just play the freaking game and react like a normal person. Jesus. I hate that I have to come to your channel to see the many obscure yet kind of cool indie games that you showcase just to have to listen to you hoot and holler like a freaking 13 year old. Jesus.
Favorite cryptid and IGP talking about dude things. Best video ever.
28:44 this man obviously auditioned for the the valve intro
I would love to see you make a scawy game
The fact that siren head taunts you and says what happened to the people and what it did makes it more unnerving to me.  I also feel like this is Siren Head moves to Appalachia with the wendigo.
The 1815 note never specified it was Siren Head terrorizing the town, just that the source of the god's power were their hearts. It is possible the game is trying to create its own horror/creepypasta themed pantheon of gods.
I love when they have him play radio stuff and other noises and not just that same audio clip of the tornado siren everyone uses! Also, I highly recommend y’all listen to The Mayfair Watchers Society, a podcast based on the works of Trevor hinderson AKA the guy behind sirenhead
I can't believe I didnt even skip a second. Before I knew it, the video ended and it's already 30min. Solid game and likewise a solid video from IGP
Question for everyone what happened to drae I need to know
IGP Please finish Deliver Us The Moon. DLC. They are apparently releasing another game based on its story!!!!❤❤❤❤
You should check out a bird called the Wattled Bellbird. This is quite literally the siren head bird
Wendigo: leave the forest fast as possible or get punished!  Me: good idea... how about you can lead me out of here and keep me safe from sirenhead?  Wendigo: oh no no no its fine. Take your time and we'll meet down the road, k?
Damn I'm 2 hours late but Idc bc this is the only horror game channel I can enjoy Edit: .25 speed 2:10 you can see siren heads head under the tree
routine ball inspection
The fact that they make a Wilford Warfstache reference brought a smile to my face
Hello IGP! Happy holidays!
The commentary in this video made so little sense it actually started making me angry
What in the world was that creature at 28:35?
I don't know why the first time he killed you you asked how and why he killed you you literally stopped in the middle of the forest looked in his direction and f****** stared at him you expected that to f****** scare him or something the c*********** 30 ft tall you're an ant to him
How did an idea as dumb as sirenhead get so popular? It has to be one of the dumbest monsters I have seen.
I heard this is what camping is like in Ohio
Didn’t see anything at the beginning when he yelled…….
IGP what happened to SurfShark?
Jesus h, tone it down IGP
Even the wendigo is scared and warning the main player of siren head 😶‍🌫️
I use to enjoy watching you :/ idk what changed
when the wendigo says to gtfo. GTFO
Next time you pick something up, I'll just put it down lol
is it Co-Op ?
Holy shit this is just like that older sirenhead game....literally the same set up
anyone notice that the clusters dont work or have needles lol
Game: "Find your friends 0/1"  I'm pretty sure friendS means more than one, not just one lol.
Fun fact, Siren Head technically did “evolve” into the form we know now. As far as I understand it Siren head can take any form similar to any post like object, kinda like how in some games it turns into street lamps or trees. Which is how it manages to catch people so easily and in places like neighborhoods.
"Hey it's Markiplier!.. Oh It's Darkiplier. Sorry."  * is a picture of Wilford Warfstache *
those goats sound so bored
There's things farting out there
I love ur vids
2:29 Bro must have an LS with a huge cam in that car, good Lord.  Edit: looks like it’s based on a 3rd Gen Camaro, so it makes sense now.
As soon as the ice cream truck music started play at 9:03 I was like "aw hell no, fuck that"😅
The only thing in my mind when I saw the last ending was: "Valve Entertainment"
I already watched this on FusionZGamers channel but I’m watching it here just for his humor.
Those content creators you "like" before the ads are done? Yeah, that's IGP
17:45 that was fucking awful. WHY did look again
yo IGP great video as always but i must admit i was stunned the first minutes of the game realizing that the voice of the player is actually cougar macdowall va from youtube bro what a great voice to voice this
Oh shiiiiet Siren Head
The Darkiplier reference is golden! A very amusing Easter egg!
Does anyone find it funny that Siren Head tried to lure IGP with ice cream music x'D (Also since when are wendigos friendly to give a warning?)
I honestly really enjoyed that
gg dude
I would like a wendigo game like this.
Man this is the second siren head game Ive heard my name in- Maybe i should stop going camping
HOLY CRAP THIS IS AWESOME!!!!  i think I had at least 3 moments where my mouse hovered over the close tab button...
Honestly thought today's sponsor was going to be depends adult diapers. 😅
"find your friends 0/1" Ah yes, friends plural, for friend singular
Shys scream XD and his laugh is creepy
Imagine you're going camping and you hear loud ass footsteps, then all of a sudden *"Hey, VSauce Michael here. How fast can you run?"*
Dude, your more grounded reviews like this are such a massive improvement on the ones you used to do where you'd feign being scared and have Icy acting like a child. Keep up the more nuanced, mature, thoughtful stuff...you're much better at that, and beyond that, you're good at it. You're still fun, but it's fun with the obnoxiousness removed. I approve on the direction your channel is going, and I find myself watching more regularly as a result.
When he fell through the stairs I about passed out
5:55 Is that the same VOA from Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, specifically the PA system? If not it is a very good facsimile.
Valve head
Games like this truly make me wish for more solid open-world horror. The things I'd give for open-world cosmic horror though, oooh my god.
That was Warfestache, it said if you see him contact Darkiplier. Because Mark played the demo of this game.
If manscaped takes care of packages, you think they work for hand fulls too?
I love these vids igp they are very scary and awesome to watch also your scream is funny
17:55 the chills that went down my spine💀
Deja Vu like a Taco Bell breakfast exiting at noon
Tbh a horror game made by IGP would be both amazing and absolutely horrifying!
why do i recognize the voice in the begining of the game?
I'm sure it's been said, but having this video playing in the background while working on classwork was really confusing - the protagonist's voice sounds a LOT like IGP.
Why the Five nights at Freddies PA Voice ?
Im only 6:41 into the video, but hear me out. Siren Head took the friends at the campsite and turned them into criptids as we've now seen two different ones so far? I mean think about it, the wendigo has deer antlers. Perhaps Sirens way of "getting revenge for the deers"?
Can you please play phasmiphobia with icy
Me after watching the 2:08 clip for the fifth time, twice on slo mo: Nope, still don't see whatever it is he saw
Fun fact, siren head is actually scp 5678
8:34 lol Indy be channeling Icy again…
lmao, love the male target ads. wonder if I could still use them...🤭
The Punisher edit was absolutely perfect!
Can someone tell me what IGP saw at 2:09? I can’t see anything ;-;
That intro is interesting.  Dude got talent.  He cam drive, look around, complain but most impressively.. make it around that windy ass road without ever turning the steering wheel  😂😂
That creature at the end might tell us that this game might have a part 2 coming out
as good as this game may be, at this time it's about the movement to forget siren head its old age was always showing.
Time for some PTSD again oh boi 😅
A Manscaped sponsor to go with a hairless Wendigo, if a cryptid can stay clean anyone can.
Love the content IGP! Keep up the good work!
11:45 i hit my space bar so hard it got stuck. also 11:36 susy bocker
So the Sirenhead is the Devil and the beast is the last remaining member of the village.
WOOO HE JUST POSTED!!!! 😭
What the fuck is that Skinwalker looking thing when you were talking about man scape it’s got like cuts on it it’s got a fucked up looking deer skull I am so confused what the fuck am I looking at it’s terrifying that’s for damn sure but what the fuck is it guess I’ll find out and see
8:35 I didn’t know wether to laugh or scream 🤣🤣
Yes! I love all of Trevor’s creatures and seeing siren head in games is so cool! Just wish there were some other Trevor monsters in games as good as this, but the pole boi is awesome nonetheless.      “Ehho it’s markiplier- oh it’s darkiplier Nevermind.” Quote of the day.
It’s always a good day with IGP 💪🏽
I like the fact sirenhead bully's you in this one.  It taunts you.  Makes it scarier.  You know the monster has contempt and is toying with you
lets go!!!! 50 min!!!!
This game looks beautiful. Quality content as always.
That was awesome. I look forward to more!
you're late to playing this game
Minecraft?
Definitely deja vu moment, this seemed like an updated version of the other siren head game where the only ending is you either get eaten or give up. Like the cultish aspects though!
You can't have IGP without Siren Head playthroughs, good to see another awesome video!
The cryptid human hunting meet up.
I love that this one doesn't just play siren noises, and actually does what it would do "in real life"
so warfstache is now darkiplier eh
ah what the flunk
This game actually gives me the chills
Not sure about anyone else but personally I think they should've waited to reveal siren head. Let him be a constant forever out of sight force to put the player on edge until finally revealing him after letting the player drop their gaurd.
Play  star citizen  with da people
3,347th
Who else is looking through comments to not be scared by the video
This was awesome!
Yeah, you definitely played this before IGP, but back then it was pixilated, and nowhere near as good as it is now. I don't blame you for thinking this was a different game.
Hi
Love the detail in the storyline!
Someone get makiplier on the phone I’d love him play this game
i like how the reload animation doesnt match the type of gun being used
Cool game, IGP. But…. Your Beware play through is better.
If I’m not mistaken this seems to be an updated version of an older siren head game I was very fond of, so super excited to see where it goes from here!
8:29 , manly scream 🤣🤣🤣
Do you think you will continue the scp fragmented minds videos?
I love how different the siren head games can be.
Ah ok
Don't forget, the full version of CLAYTOWN HORROR is out now!! Can't seem to get anyone to give it a chance, they all think the demo they tried was all there was. Same with the awesome 'KEEP OUT' ToyStory style game that everyone played the super short demo then forgot about it...
Love it igp keep on making vids!! No matter what we will still love you and them
IGP what was that? that's an ending? Well my friend you went prone in the grass. He said lay down as you were leaving the watch tower it gave you a prompt to go prone and give up. This is exactly what happened. Edit: NVM.
Was that markiplier in the intro or am I high agian
Yeah, this is either a remake of that last game or just an updated version of it, because the fake radio lines about the kids & from the 'cops' as well as gameplay & graphics are copied directly from the game a couple years ago... 🤔🤔🤔
this game is REALLY fucking good
How tf does he see half the shit he sees I never see it
Bro... I just was gonna watch your old siren head video ... What a coincidence
How? I was literally just talking about siren head before you posted this. Coincidence maybe.
Zero brightness is absolutely terrifying
this gave me so much anxiety XD        also igp, are you still selling the plushies? my birthday is coming up in january and i plan on getting one
Is it just me or is this a remake of some other game?
The fact their is a wilford and darkiplier Easter egg makes me happy
Fun fact: this game is a remake of another siren head game
Nobody: Igp: messing with the deer. Me: hmmmmmmm....
Hey IGP, you’ve been one of my favorite content creators for years now. Thanks for keeping at it all this time.
Its a shame things get ran into the ground so people get tired of making them. Like id still love to see Slenderman games if they used a new gaming formula beyond finding letters.
I can't watch this rn its dark af outside
oh hey thats just down the road
i was literally about to go to bed, however ur videos are totally worth sacrificing my sleep and sanity lmao
First 10k let's go love you videos
Earlllyyy LETS HUNT
already at 7k views, you truly are something!
Bollocks, Innit?
No vehicles beyond this point, finds truck.
Games like these are so awesome. Thank you igp
The part that makes me laugh so much is the screen shaking when he screams
Those Deer's were the true threat...They can drive even the most sane man insane..
Dry content
There is a war of the world's horror/survival game that is in development. I think it would be something that is up your alley I hope you check it out.
Now I can't go to sleep, have to watch that first 🙏
This would be even funnier with if he used his face cam in my opinion 😂
Yay more siren head stuff. the last game was not that creepy in my opinion  Edit: That guy at the end made me say PYRAMID HEAD!
heyyy keep on keeping on man, your content always satisfies. thx.
I have low self esteem, but your videos slowly make me feel better, it’s the one thing that makes me happy, thank you IGP
Ha one of the first
Was literally just thinking, "Damn, when's IGP gonna upload again?"   Ask and you shall receive lol.
Oh man I have to play this now
Ooooh yes, I've had a terrible day but this makes it a good deal better. Truly appreciate what you do for us 💜
2:15 I didn’t why? what was it??? WHY ARE WE PANICKING??
Yesss new IGP vid n I just rolled a doobie 🤟🤘
2:05 I didn't see anything up there so I thought you where just screaming at the ray of light lmao
Any plans for the Callisto Protocol?
REGRET.
E
I know you love Cthulhu,  so check out Isle of Eras.  It's Lovecraftian bliss.
Cool game, IGP. But…. Your Beware play through is better.
Hey IGP can you do more of the newer Signal Simulator I really enjoyed it.
Horror games like these are always fun to watch get letsplayed
I love him being scared shitless
Are you ever going to try to beat the blood fang forest in foklor hunter?
69th comment (nice)
Gay
I'm early finally
Dude watching your videos makes me so happy and they cheer me up!!!! I'm constantly rewatching The Isle and Phasmophobia!! <3
The voice actor for the main character has a youtube channel, I don't remember what it is but ill edit this.     Edit: couldn't find their channel but they narrate for a channel called emkay.
I feel like I’ve been here before lol
yiiihaaaaa igggggggppppppppp!!!!!!!
Tlo_oly? Is that him? What Is he doing there?
Fun to refresh the page and see you views jump up and comments. Love your videos. I watch them everytime i can.
I always love and enjoy your uploads!
number 55 ayee
Yeassss!! Love siren head lore and games!!
Love the videos
I love how IGP makes the lawn mower even sound horrifying
I love how sarcastic the character is 😂
I hope more of Trevor Hendersons creations get this treatment in future. It might take away from the character that gets popular a bit but it draws more people into the weird depths of his creations it's awesome. This game is neat but I just remembers the default dancing siren head meme and never mind. Humanity
An igp upload is like when the munchies kick in and the pizza guy is already ringing the doorbell. 😊
Great Video!!
I exist.. no your lying... STOP TALKING!!!!!!!
Yooooo doing a siren head vid? nice
Hell ya...
Yesssss! Another video :> love watching IGP play horror games xD :>
