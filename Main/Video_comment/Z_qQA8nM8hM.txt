he will take from campaign  donations
Меня уволили с позором и я забыл
Lock him up
Aged so well.  How long have you all been in Trump's pocket?
Ummm. It is March 24 right now and not 1 bank will lend him a dime!!! LOL
Is Forbs eating crow now???!!!  It is March 24 right now and 1 day away from the state seizing Trump's assets to pay the money!!!😂😂
Latisha james made sure he cant pay
U cant sell something in a week
The assets do not appear to be free and clear...
Wow- this video didn’t age well! 😂
Absolute scam americas becoming more and more a bananna republic.  In all his dealings its up to the bank to do its due diligence and he had disclaimers in all those deals absolving liability .  While Joe biden runs pay to play schemes with withforeign entities like china and ukraine. He sols out american interest in highly needed lithium deposits to china for ancouple million bucks .     The whole world is watching and 75’percentnof America knows this is politically motivated prosecutions
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA that's why he only has roughly 40 million cash on hand now and he himself seems quite concerned about losing his properties!!! If this is true then someone should tell him cuz he seems to think otherwise lmao
This video isn't aging well
Lol never gonna watch Forbes again.. Nothing but lies...
UPDATE: March 20, 2024  TFG is broke and can't rub 2 dimes together. LMAO
Well, now we know this is an unreliable source 😂😂😂
😂😂😂
I'm not a cattle farmer but I know bullshit when I see it! If he's a billionair? Why is he panhandling for 5 bucks 10 ir 25 if you can spare it? It's pathetic and sickening. Vote blue 💙 straight take it down ballot.
3/19/24 - well you chuckleheads really called that one! 😂
He can't sell the assets because he is over leveraged with existing mortgages on the properties.  He's a con artist, not a real billionaire.
THIS IS BULLSHIT FAKE NEWS,,,,  A  2 BEDROOM CONDO IN MIDTOWN GOES FOR 2,5 MILLION .,,,
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 wrong
lmao🤣
Mar a lago is valued at $27 million.
Really? Thats weird because today he said he can't pay.
THIS AGED WELL
Boy is this article out of date and just plan wrong.
Mortgage free??! This story is a lie. ALL his properties have major leans. Who wrote this? Trump’s PR firm? And Mar a Lago is worth 27 million respectively. 300 million? What utter nonsense.
🤣 Lmao!  It was just reported that the so called billionaire couldn’t come up with the money.  His gofundme failed big time!  I guess his cult might be coming to their senses after all, or maybe they’re just tapped out already.  Either way it’s a glorious day!  🤣🤣🤣
Putin and the Saudis will back him... He can do the. Favors again.
300 million for Maralardo? That’s a joke more like 18 million
Putin is gonna give him the money  USA FOR SALE
Hes  may very well be under investigation concerning his golf courses in Scotland.
$300 million for Mar a Lardo??🤣🤣🤣🤣. This property has so many exception that he devaluated the property by himself and is only worth a fraction. First off it's not a home its a hotel which lessens the price significantly
Forbes is foney. Jus say'n.
lol
I don't believe any of it
Lititia & angoran they better not use the money for New York states sanctuary.
250 years of slavery in America,  100 years of jim crow in America. Now the son of a Klansman is selling America to the highest bidder.  America was never a democracy.
In October of 23, Forbes dropped him off of their own listing....the Forbes 400 listing of richest Americans.
If it was Forbes described, he would have done it already to demonstrate his liquidity and solidify his status.  Alas, he folded like a cheap suit.
Forbes got punked 😂
Mar lar go is valued at $27 million.
No one will lend him money and assets will be sold for Pennies on the dollar.
Total BS
Because they will take them! Lmao
Fobes Where do you come up with this stuff???
Trumpinsky will get it from Putin his better half.
because he'll treat it like any other bill and not pay it?
Balderdash. Even when this was posted, the figures were fundamentally flawed.
This is what happens with this “news” sources. Just some wishful thinking without any investigation.
Would you like to think about your bull$hit video statement on Dementia J's financial "health" Forbes? We'll wait........
So why did he offer the court just $100 million?
I would love for whoever is spreading the propaganda to put some proof what's what they are saying I'm second tired of the bullshit from both sides proof damn it only proof.
Well your rankings were  based on his submittal to you. Which you knew were lies so why should we believe your lies now?
Have you somehow missed the fact that the judgment against TFG has to do with the fraudulent overvaluation of his assets?  And would it be a shocker to you if the self-proclaimed king of debt's real estate assets are so leveraged that he has little to no equity in them?  I'm just a schmuck with some critical thinking skills and no background in finance, the law, or real estate.  You're Forbes Magazine.  Shouldn't you have a better grasp of this than you're displaying?
ChatGPT  generated?  Smart financial Ivy league educated "owes" $0.5B of a net worth of $2.6B.  Only rich people can afford their bad behavior costing 20% of their net worth.  In contrast, the poor shop lift from CVS.
He ain’t come up with the $83.000.000 for the Eugene Carrol appeal and has only 4 days left as of today lol , so what does that say about him coming up with the other Millions 😂
Forbes no one listens to you He wont have to pay anything
Totally click-bait-ish 😂
Pundent 😂 fake news
Maybe Trump’s buddy Putin will give him some money to save him. Trumps has now money of his own at all.
Sounds like this animal has nothing to worry about . Why is he always asking for Money?It warms my heart to hear he is ready to pay his bills as he should . My vote is worth more to me . I’m voting for Joe Biden  he is worth way more than trumff towers and dilapidated golf courses .
Mara lago is worth 18 million
Fake news- Reported as misleading.
He has borrowed on many of these properties, and kept it quiet with NDAs! Then, as per SOP -  LIED ABOUT IT!  Just how gullible can Forbes be. !!!?
You sure his property is 1.1 billion…… he mis valued or in correctly valued his property .. that’s why we are here now. 🤮😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
His balance sheet...you mean the piece of paper that has in the fine print the following disclaimer; 'Do Not Trust These Financials'
And I thought Forbes was a serious  informator... Shame on Yoy....
Your information is definitely not accurate, he does not have the money put up this amount for appeal.  Now that tells you how unreliable your information actually is…
Great video. 🤭👎🏼
That background music could be used at Guantanamo Bay
How such an outlandish "verdict" can be allowed to stand is mind boggling.  No fairness, no equal justice, just vindictive behavior by 2 persons in conspiracy to hurt a political opponent. This SC houl be overturned and the 2 arrested for such misuse of their office.
Again… Forbes trying to cover its embarrassment from trumps fake numbers  they believed for decades.
If Mar-A-Lago is worth $300,000,000 then he owes Florida millions in property taxes! But he won't need to sell anything, because New York will be glad to sell his property for him😂😂🤣
Wonder the number of those peoples who were paid to be there,kind of mercenary    of occasion.
Bs
lol 😂 what’s this rubbish? He’s already admitted to not having the money!  He’s losing those buildings in a few days - stop lying to your audience Forbes - you’ve already lied about this conman’s wealth for well over 40 years - now you need to move into reality- he’s cooked
Coulda should woulda. It's all academic he's going to prison 😅😅😅
The SPAC deal is in litigation with the originators of the site there Einstein! I doubt there will be any movement there this year!😂
Guess we'll find out soon.
Did you know Forbes is owned by Chinese communists?
No way Mar a Lago is worth $300 million. Forbes has always overestimated Trump's net worth, sometimes by billions. They take what he says and publishes it. They need to sharpen their pencils.
Forbes, I love it, those beady little eyes of his.  Hope that you will lend him the money.
a presidential candidate who owns hundreds of millions of dollars to a foreign country, just what we need! 😂
Democraps are jealous of this video. It drives them crazy Lollllllll
All he has to do is pass a few more "Top Secret" documents to Saudi Arabia.
Canceled my trip to New York, not that anyone cares - but I just could not justify a vacation to such a currupt place.
You'd think that if anyone would lend to a proven fraud who will screw anyone it would have happened by now, but who knows.
HAhaha !!!!! You really believe this FORBES?????????????????????????????????
Forbes should feel embarrassed.
Putin: please please i need money
Why isn't he paying?
sorry, i call BS on this one. He has less than a week to post 83M to EJ Carroll.....and hasnt as of today, she can have the state seize his property in a week. Thats a slamdunk he could do. If he only has 400M would he use all of it? nope, and lets not forget his counter offer , which sorry that not a thing you can do, is likely prompted by the fact he doesnt want to use all of his cash.  Any sale must be complete  and money in the bank by the 30 day mark, as he has 7 for Carroll and 20 days for the state he probably doesnt have the time to sell and close on the sale before the 20 day mark. Also lets not forget all of his corporate assets are subject to control and audit by the judge appointed as overseer. They have been caught redhanded moving assets to Florida in violation of the law so its likely he will get a criminal charge for that. His other option is loan, which is likely his best, but his terms will suck as he is under pressure and has been convicted of 90 pages of financial fraud. His Truth Social Sale/merger is likely to get put on hold well as there is serious litigation in multiple states. He's backed into a corner for sure, his best bet would be to get a bank to buy a property outright and do a quick closing, so i think his best option is to dump a property he wont miss and hope he can raise 500M to stave off colection fopr Carrol and pay for fraud appeal
Forbes will pay for the djt, it seems.
Lol 😂sure he couldn’t even put up the money to appeal his case
Did he pay already??🤣🤣
Will the court accept Rubles? Asking for a friend...
Who’s greedy enough to throw more good money after bad?
Then why hasn`t he done it?
Yikes Forbes, did you actually rely on known fraudulent financial records and the word of a criminal to write this article? Respect for your investigative journalism has gone down hill, shame on you for this obvious biased reporting.
At first i thought this was a legitimate video...but quickly realized my mistake as this amounts to a healthy dose of satire.
If Forbes believes in Trump's balance sheet, maybe they should put up the money for him.
Even if the value estimates are correct and willing counterparties could be found, this analysis presumes that these financings or sales could be concluded before the end of March. Seems a bit optimistic.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Then he should have paid the fine early instead of accruing interest. Not good business letting the interest accrue.
I already sent him $20 bucks.
misleading
No he cant borrow agaist Mar alardo. Liars
I got my Orville Redenbacher popping - CAN.  NOT.  WAIT.  FOR.  THIS.
Oh dear looks like the orange Mussolini will have to sell his property. In another issue, orange must maintain his wealth of $2.5b with $50m in cash in his bank account according to his DB back loan. Once he sells, it will goes against his contract. Plus other banks can't do business with him due to court orders.
A "future" President owing $400 MILLION to a FOREIGN party? How is that NOT a direct threat to national security?
Nobody is going to be stupid enough to risk lending that traitor anything.
lol, what a load of bollocks
@Forbes Part of the fraud system are you? Quite frankly get a better narrator bot, the one you use pauses incorrectly.
Forbes lose all credibility with videos like this. It is all BS.
Are you now talking about actual values, or the values that he has claimed, that is the reason of the penalty he has to pay?
I guess we will find out very soon if his balance sheet is yet another work of fiction.
Usual Forbes Bullshit
Comical that forbes believes trumps balance sheets. He just got convicted for fraud. Geez
The politicians are crooked and need to be held accountable
He now has less than 20 days to come up with the cash. It takes time to raise cash from real estate but then again I now think he will declare bankruptcy and blame it on the radical left. Btw, the courts gave him a break allowing him to get a NY bank to give him a loan.
You cannot sell a building in 30 days.  He won't come up with a dime.  750 LLCs all have to be broken in 10 years of court proceedings to get at them.  Then all the lienholders and contractors and employees all start suing for their pieces.
Dream ON!
300$ million for his property in Florida. Forbes is just as silly as the Judge !
Time to update this story and have it re-read by the text to speech ap. He doesn’t have the money.
Rubbish!
If so  … Than what’s the hold up ? CLICKBAIT for sure
Please stop before I throw up.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NO LONGER THE PARTY OF REAGAN..😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
AMERICA IS ALREADY GREAT!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Mar a lago is valued at $27 million.
I'd like to see a new movie from Hollywood, a remake of the old 'VANISHING POINT' classic where some powerful 77 y\o Ukrainian guy pretending to be his cousin gets into a superfast EV automobile, made in America of course, then drives into a couple of huge D11 bulldozers placed in the middle of nowhere to catch a corporate businessman hiding his tax losses...
Also he is properties are probably mortgaged to the hilt. Is there anyone at Forbes left that actually does any research any more?
Well if he really have that much money you said....why he didn't paid it yet???? The only thing he did is crying about it....
You big mouths at Forbes should cover him for the money if he needs help
He doesn't have friends
Delusional
Predicated on Trump's balance sheet being reliable, lenders heing foolish enough to go near him, and the existence of listed assets.  Ignores current debt commitments and apparent inability for the organization to conduct transactions until it is under new management.  Risky prospect when there is no guarantee he will be elected or seize power.
#BS 🎉
So Forbes estimates his net worth as $2.6 billion…  wonder where they got that number?  🤔
ONLY FORBES BELIEVES THAT....
This is b*ll*cks - he has nowhere near $400 million in cash. No-one will lend him money at a reasonable rate, because he has a history of defaulting and weaselling out of things - he is currently trying to stiff his partners in Truth Social. He could sell off some of the stuffed weasels he wears on his head, in one inch square,s for $1,000 a pop. They would look nice as details on his Golden Sneakers - if they ever turn up - they are not due to arrive till July 2024. He might be bankrupt by then.
I been trying to figure out if this chanel was real.... Know I know it is...😂😂😂
😅😅
Not what is reported  in previos reports liars who.
Does the silly background music add anything to this interesting report? In my opinion no!
How can you be THIS wrong?
Y doesnt he get it from Jared he has billions that the saudis paid him..Dons his father in law.they wete all in cohouts together to defraud the USA 🇺🇸
Lies!! He doesn't have 400 million to work with.  Hope he gets stripped of any properties he actually owns.
How do you know that these “Mortgage free“ properties have not been Use this collateral for trump’s other debts, like the hundreds of millions of dollars he owes the Russians according to Eric?
He won't even a penny. Stop the expectation
oops, looks like Forbes fell for his BS too.
The idiot judge says Mar a Lago is only worth 18 million.
We will find out soon enough if you are making sense.
His good buddy Putin will bail him out
Why would a company loan a criminal money. Does not make sense.
Why borrow? Put up or ...well...300 million? 😅😅 why not a billion?
I think that Forbes need to hire decent journalists who know how to fact check before making news...unless you work for FOX or Newsmax that is.
Theoretically ”borrow”.  This is bogus.
What a Buzz Kill Forbes is.
300 Million Dollar for Mar-a-Lago? Yeah, right, the appraiser of the county valued it at ~27 Million, so about 1/11 of the Forbes estimate ...
This line of argument by you went out the door very quickly.
Boy this didn't age well. Much like Forbes.
WELL AS TISH AND ENGORON SAID TRUMP'S PROPERTIES WERE VALUED LOWER THEN WHAT HE PAID THE PROPERTY TAXES ON, HE NEEDS TO DEMAND IMMEDIATE REFUND FROM NEW YORK TO COVER THE APPEAL COSTS.
He owes our state money lying cheat
Hes a cheat and just wants to feed his waste for hisself
He dosnt wanta pay anybody
Forbes Sucks, what a Joke. 😂😂😂
Never believed Forbes ever.
Who wrote the script?    1. He doesn't have $400 in liquid assets, and much of this needs to be available  to pay staff, maintain properties, etc.    2. Mar-a-Largo (sp?) has deed restrictions  that limits its use as a club.   So, its worth is directly related to its limited club revenue.   3. The numerous golf courses have had a $300 million loss over past 18 years.   4. Potential lenders will be very concerned about lending to a powerful person who could stiff them for  repayment.
Sounds like Coppertop property valuations.
Koch, Musk, Thiel going to bail him out.
This video aged so quickly.
They are misinformed!
He is NOT the future president.. the man is the second worst president in the history of the United States
friggin PROPAGANDA ✅✅✅
Time to change "Forbes" to "Fibs".
He is going to screw investors in his Truth social media!!! Bet on it!
Appealing the NY CASE is dependent on actually posting the cash or a bond, then the Appeal will fail.
What bank would be stupid enough to lend him money??????????????
Wow, egg on your face  already.  Not well vetted either.  Meidas Touch  has the real receipts.
Because he sold U.S secrets 😮
They don't call him Teflon Don for no reason. I can assure you he will come out of this stronger than ever.
Forbes is too drunk on Orange Kool-Aid.
This is complete nonsense
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He’ll get a loan from Forbes,  then default, as usual
Damn Forbes, your bias isn’t aging well. Seems Forbes is aligned with newsmax these days
Can Putin pay Trumps debt?
Nobody in their right mind would lend to Drump.
The Government just Wants Money to Fund the War in Ukraine
Bullshit
ARE YOU SURE he has 27 “Unencumbered” properties worth $1.1B??? Does anyone take Trump’s word at face value after the NYC expose of all his overly inflated assets???
This horseshit judgement against him will be reversed and every dime they collect for the appeal bond will be returned.  The corrupt AG along with others involved in this sham lawsuit will be held accountable for their abuse of process, politically motivated selective prosecution & misapplication of law.
He doesn't own them. They're all mortgaged to the hilt based on his lies. Bye bye 'empire'.
This video didn't age well.
Who the fuck's side are you on
Election Interference
Folks we can now have a new word.. everyone together.. FAKE BILLIONAIRE  and looks like Fani Willis and Ms Carrol have grabbed him by the ^$(*&
If he was a billionaire he wouldn’t be asking to pay 100 millions only. He is a compulsive liar so nothing of what he says is true.
Has Forbes ever had a realistic understanding of Trump's Financials?  😂
That’s good, right, if only he would just pay, there will be less noise
Nonsense
No he can not!!!!
He said he had 400 mil cash and you actually believed him
you make it seem he is mortgage free, prove that, dont say that
😂😂😂😂 Marvelous delusions  😂😂😂😂
His idiotic Fans probably will pay for it.
What a guy… organization guilty of fraud, charity guilty of fraud, university, yes a fraud. guilty of sexual assault, guilt of and more guilty verdicts coming. He cannot run a business with 11 people without fraud and you think he should run the United States 😂 laughable
Of course, he wont have to sell any real estate holdings. New York state will do that for him. Then he'll need alot more when he losses the lawsuits brought by the US Capitol police. Then, the IRS will be wanting the taxes it was defrauded. If he had the money, he would just get a bond. Yeah, he could get his buddy Putin to foot the bill.
Then the question is why hasn't he paid it??? Because the man is broke 😂
Liar! Liar! Pants on Fire!!!!
WOW THIS VIDEO IS SUCH BS?  SURE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE BASED IN THE REALITY OF WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING.
Mar A Lago was estimated to be worth not more than $50 million and the video stated $300 million. We know which side Forbes is on.
He wont have to come up with any money anyway because the whole charge is ridiculous.
Um seems like you’re wrong bro … he has no cash he says
This hasn't aged well.  "He simply write a check to pay what he owes".  He did write check for 100 million which was promptly denied because NY wants the full amount.  I'll be ignoring Forbes in the future.  Now I know how bad their reporting is.
Dear Forbes, why are you playing that mindless annoying music with this video? Thumbs down!
Wishful thinking 😂😂
Answer because won't have to pay that thing at the end
He could also hire a few mercs and ignore the illegal and unjustified verdicts against him.
I do not believe this, is fake news.
Let’s see what the criminal trials amount to.???
Money and Power, crazy.
Nonsense. He has a negative creditworthiness. No lender will lend against these assets.
Sell sell sell and then pay pay pay
500 million right now
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
PURE BS😅😅😅
bullshit
Just open the cartons!
Better check out the information on his property's. He'll borrow his money from Russia  again
He already owes on his buildings!!
ALL THE FALS COURT PENALTIES WILL FALL FLAT
He will have to liquidate everything. His empire is a house of cards built on leverage. When one piece falls, all else comes crumbling. If you have ever seen a large financial loan contract, you know it is replete with covenants allowing the loan to be called when the lender is convicted of a crime; defaults on a payment; becomes insolvent; loses a license to operate; etc. All those covenants are going to be triggered soon or have been triggered already. It is a matter of time before the creditors start calling their loans. Next stop is Chapter 11.
Fischer-Price toys could have written a more accurate article.
Narrator, a note from a sound guy: _Pop filter_
Bs, he can't write a check and banks will  not touch the crook
That aged poorly.
The day after this pod Forbes change its mind. Yesterday, they said he couldn't come up with the money.BIG MISTAKE,HUH?
If he had the money he would have put it up when a file for an appeal!!!!
Your delusional Forbes
Oh he will be selling his crappy underpriced buildings.
🤣😂🤣..plenty of money 😂
This 'news' is total BS......  He's pleading to only have to put up a 100 million dollar bond, and with commercial real estate in the tank post covid he's going to be really under the gun here AND the interest will help kill him!!
“Theoretically”, being the operative word.
Forbes 🤣! If he could pay it he would.
If he has all these assets, he can now pay all his lawyers (legal debt). They should go after it.
This entire video is completely wrong. And you know ow it. When will you stop being that grifter’s shill?
but mar a Lago isnt worth that much.. its a comercial property, so its only worth what you can sell it for..
He won't ever have to pay the state
Wait you are telling me a skyscraper in NYC only costs 52 million??? Thats way less than i thought it would cost.
But are his properties really worth what you're saying...I mean this is the reason he owes NY this money
😅
🎉❤
He should sell everything in NY anyhow and GTFO of NY.
Stop with the lies if this was true he wouldn't have this judgment place on him this is pure bullshit
i used to hold Forbes in high regard.  But, seeing this misunderstanding of Trump's assets and their valuation makes rethink Forbes' supposed expertise.  Not only that, but the more of these Forbes videos that I watch, the more I start to think that Forbes has a right wing slant.
More Forbes BS.
NYC is gonna be a ghost town in a couple of weeks!
So it seems Forbes doesn't think a foreign billionaire currying favour with a potential US president is a problem? Errr... Some should read "The Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution"
Not a chance!
Bullshit, he's broke 😂😂
@2:58 I guess when money is your only focus you don't realize that having a president who owes a foreign entity hundreds of millions of dollars is a gaping security risk.
You forgot to mention all the money his cult keeps sending in.
BS
Forbes is a JOKE.  After today’s court filing where it was revealed that Stinky doesn’t have the cash, Forbes does not have the common sense…or the integrity…to take this ridiculous post down.
Trumps money is tied up in property.  Also he will be getting 4 billion dollars in 6 months from truth social
Really?  Then why could he not post his appeal bonf?  You have no connection with reality.
WRONG!🤣😂
I came in just to comment and ask Forbes, "are you kidding me?"
He could bond it. He doesn't have to borrow anything.
Election interference.
You can beg some money for him.
Borrow more money from Russia.
Where are you getting this mortgage free info? It it was true, he would’ve already paid he debt. I call bullshit.
Not fair
My understanding is he refinanced all those properties. They ask now have mortgages
I stopped watching when this said he had 400 mil liquidity. First off how do you know that? Oh let me guess HE said it 😂😂😂 & second NO HE DOES NOT! So this is big fake news & a joke. He doesn’t even have 100 mil which he’s offering because he wants to go thru a bondsman with that which means he’d pay a fraction. So this video is nothing but false reporting! Disgraceful
Either this article is full of nonsense or Sir Stump is lying so he won’t have to pony up to cover his debts. Or as many have always believed, he only super wealthy in his own mind not in reality because he wants to be a big shot.
This ai generated narrative is so far behind.
he can borrow from putin real easy.
Lock him up ASAP
King Con😂
Forbes over-gouging the property values… what do they gain for doing that??
Your narrator has a very creepy voice.
PURE PROPAGANDA.  Drumph has lied all along about his assets/cash.  No one wants to lend Drumph money now because he has defaulted all his life.
I have great doubts that his properties are debt free.
God Bless the President 🇺🇲
Well all I can say is that we are in the politics but After seeing how successful he is and all that he does that I think the United States needs him as president because he knows how to build empires and businesses and he canBuild America stronger.😊
Elon …. Make it happen, captain!
Trump's own lawers filing directly said he has less than $300 million where do you come uo with $400 million
Forbes "reporting" is so far off i had to check to make sure this channel wasn't fake
No matter if this is an accurate financial statement, the fine is ridiculous in my opinion. Why is no one going after Biden and all the BS with his dealings and family dealings? But more than any of that.....   why are people not insisting on more candidates for president? I am tired of trying to figure which one is the better choice of two that I don't want to vote for. It seems like it has been that way since Jimmy Carter ran.
Forbes doesn't even pretend to be a legit news source these days. (To be clear, neither does MSNBC, Fox, etc.)
Fake news😂
Forbes is an accomplice to tRumps crimes.  Hopefully they take that 30,000 apartment first
Well then why hasn't he put it up
Nice political commercial I wonder who this guy is voting for
What cash? He doesn’t have cash! Of please..
But as he does nothave any debt free property, this whole video is obviously another chumptrump lie meant to look like an indepent report. Yeah, right.
Aged like milk
Even if he can come up with the money, and even if this does not effect his decision making, at the very least, he is foolishly giving away his money. Its just more evidence that he is not the brightest business man. Also, this takes up a lot of his time and focus, further demontrating that he is not in control or any kind of shot caller🤷‍♂️. And, if he keeps up his stupidity, he'll keep losing lawsuits. And, if he straightens out, then he is being controlled and quieted even more🤷‍♂️.
I can't wait till Elon loans him the money interest free and the MSM heads just explode, again.
what a load of rubish pfft
Let's see if you're right Steve... Even if Trumps net worth as you said is 2.6B, still a liability of 500M is 20% of his net worth. That's substantial.
Where are they getting their info?  Does he really have $400 million in cash?  How does he invest that money?  How do they know his properties are mortgage free?
The bank should be at fault not the customer...
FDT
His Kool -Ade drinking followers will pay it happily.
Forbes, pull your head out. You are getting easier and easier to ignore.
This is fraud!
That's awesome that he has all of those assets to borrow from.  What I would like to know is why he has made his donors pay for all of the legal fees he's racked up so far. I believe it's 50 million plus. It's my belief that the reason is that he is cheap and never wants to pay for anything himself if he can get out of it. He has ripped off countless contractors who did work for him so he doesn't have to pay them, and he is well known for not paying his lawyers.
Who would lend him money?  He does not pay anybody?  He overstates is balance sheet by multiples.  He is not liquid.
This video is B.S., his properties aren’t mortgage free. His only chance is to get the money from the sell of Truth Social.
Probably already mentioned by others.. but Forbes is owned by a Chinese company- Since 2014, Forbes magazine has been owned by Integrated Whale Media Investments, a Hong Kong-based investment group.
And so they are, their estimates apparently way off.  .  He does not have the cash according to Forbes today LOL Feb 29
I don't think this report is accurate 😂😂
Forbes, I see you didnt mention his shares in Truth Social valued at 4billion dollars. The liberals that stopped learning in college are fuming in here. LMAO
Satire is meant to feel somewhat plausible. You should take lessons from, for example, the Onion.
How does it feel to get caught lying?  Forbes is propaganda.
alot of acoustic people in these comments dont have assets or know how to leverage them
What bullshit😂,, smoke and mirrors
Forbes out here proving they live in an alternative fact reality. Nobody is surprised though.
Sooner or later his stuff will be seized one way or another.
If you can’t come up with the bond, he will be for sell his buildings his assets. That is a fact you write wing media don’t know what you’re talking about.
If he is worth so much…. Let’s see what happens in 3 weeks.  I will not subscribe to Forbes. This is a China owned media source. Misinformation at work.
New York accepted his property tax payments so how can they say the values were wrong ??????
Mortgage free? Dream on........
Trump’s Amazing That’s Why They’re Coming After Him From Every Side Because They Can’t Buy Him And He Will Expose All The Deceptive Corruption In Our Government
Well, this didn't age well.
So funny. If that was true, he wouldn’t be doing so bad financially. He’s in debt hundreds of millions already. He overvalued his places for years, so we can’t believe these figures 😂
The background music is a distraction and lends nothing to the presentation !!!!!!!!!
so why is he whinging about his poverty? More bullshit. Fortunately the DOJ is not buying his garbage.
Forbes lying again!!!
Forbes fell flat on their face on accuracy with this one.
Who is going to lend him money?  Given his history of avoiding , creditor, contractors, banks - there wouldn't be too many people willing to lend him this amount of money.
YOUR COMPUTATION IS WRONG!  BORROWING MEANS GETTING LESS, A LOT LESS FROM YOUR COLLATERAL.  GO BACK TO SCHOOL!
LOL !  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT NOT SELLING?  HE STARTED SELLING SNEAKERS!
And fors the ever wise forbes know which bank on earth would give him a mortgage?????
Another "THING" Ivory Tower OBSERVERS do not know anything about OR CARE ABOUT IS, little people like me get DESTROYED, e.g. IMPOVERISHED, TORTURED & BRUTALLY BEATEN IN TORTURE CHAMBERS for making a stand against Corrupt Government REROBATES & it never makes the NEWS. WHEN THE TRAITORS DO WHAT THEY DO TO DJT PUBLICLY IT IS MILD TO WHAT THE TRAITORS DO TO We the pupils aka pawns PEONS!!
1:37 that clown of a judge said Maralago is worth $18 million
Who wrote this ?
Fake news!
If any of this is true, why have his lawyers filed a brief asking the court for a stay of judgment, saying that he would be forced to sell properties under “exigent circumstances”…?? 🤔🤔🤔
I see the shade Forbes is throwing at the judge who valued Mar-a-Lago at just 18 million dollars. That judge was so uneducated on real estate it hurt.
How is Mar a Lago worth $300m when he signed an easement in PERPETUITY that it can't ever be developed or a private residence???
Perhaps you are correct. But he is cheap so he will emdeavour to not pay a penny if he can. That is whst he is best at, avoiding payment.
It took only a day for this to age poorly lol.
If Trumph become president he could easily cover even double that amount by just winking at Putin.
Amen
Forbes is really on par with the Weekly World News these days. Next up: Forbes gauges the worth of the Pyramids on Mars...
I thought Forbes was good at math?
How is he going to borrow against his properties when he gas been barred from doing any business with any NY bank, which is basically all banks in the country?
So where's this cheque he simply has to write?
THE CASE IS GOING TO BE REVERSED SOON       THE JUDGES HAD CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND HAD NO BUSINESS GETTING INVOLVED TO BEGIN WITH       THEY ARE NOT LEGIT JUDGES BUT DEMOCRATS        MAR-A-LAGO WORTHH  400M           HE MAY SELL TRUTH SOCIAL  WORTH 4 BILLION
Ever notice the richest of American’s ..the real generational wealth….never seem to be on the list..because they don’t want to be known….those that do want to be on just the power list just inflate, inflate inflate…this is why Donny thinks what he did is perfectly fine.  For him I guess,  you or I would be in prison already…..Remember Leona Hemsley of NY. Owner of a hotel, by all accounts cheap and wrote off everything, basically taking deductions she wasn’t entitled to take…creating fraud like Donny…well off to prison she went…there were many others.   Donny’s conspiracy theory nut case friend Alex Jones who was ordered to pay nearly 1 billion dollars in damages didn’t think he was going to pay either…well the courts have basically sold everything he owned and will take everything he makes between now and the day he dies to pay off or go towards that billion dollar judgement….i hope it was all worth it.  If Donny has the money he claims and we all know he doesn’t then be honorable and pay off your debts…well we know he won’t…so I hope they take take take from him and his knucklehead boys….Eric and Donny Jr.    Poor Donny Jr has his summer retreat house in his dad’s LLC or trust…..oops looks like that might be liquidated as a result…sad:(
This hasn't aged very well.
let see...
He can buy African country with that kind of money!
Forbes of course is on Trumps side as they are VERY right wing and those valuations are way of the mark
Is it because he really dosent own those buildings?
Trick No Good! Putin wants you!
nice risk management. lol
Love the way they note the values of property in New York which are businesses and therefore not subject to Trump's will, given he just got banned from running a business in New York along with any family member.  But of course that is all superfluous now given how badly this post aged in 2 days.
Right. Not only was that incredibly wrong, but the timing of such arrogant and misconceived assertions was almost dooming Forbes to instant notoriety for rank stupidity. I know who never to get financial advice from in future.
This video is BS, he said a while back he had around 400 mil in cash, but if you believe that I'd like to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge and Amway.
You have already been proven WRONG.
Well now see here, and the crooked judge said 18 million was lago worth,thats why he will when win appeal even if it is an democrat court,the world is watching
Maybe the Forbes AI they used to create this narrative and video is hallucinating...
If everything  is paided off and he cannot borrow  he still can't  pay.  If he get the money he can't paid the leaner.  He can't make a y money cause he donot have business.
lol Donny can't sell any of "his" buildings; they're encumbered and damn near worthless to begin with.
If he has so much money, why won't he put up the required bond?  I expect what they said about someone bailing him out will be the case. I'm betting on the Russians.
How is it that Forbes knows his worth, when no one else on Earth does, except those in his criminal family.
uninformed video, my guy has not a positive net worth 😂
Thid didnt age well
Do you catch the irony?   His fraudulent balance sheet is what got him here.
Why do libs get on here and make statements about things where they know nothing? Educate yourselves.
FORBES— Financial evaluation of Trump’s properties is extremely low. Their evaluation of the properties is off by BILLIONS
So this is  fake All properties are clear.
The courts could also find the fines excessive or with no legal merit .
27 mortgage free properties are worth 10 BILLION DOLLARS PLUS
This video sure enraged the TDS suffering cultists 😂
Fake
His balance sheet is leveraged...or he would write that check...if his properties were mortgage free...
Take it all from Him, It was both with bad money
Y’all full of it!!
Putin will write his employee a check for the classified documents
Forbes is a worthless prediction tool.
Forbes company should give him the loan. It looks like they have a lot of money 🤣🤣🤣
Ho for it we well see , are they payed for i think not.
Your information is incorrect 😮 You will need an attorney after this post 😮
Anything with Rrymp name on it is automatically worth less......
He's done Forbes!! He's done! He can't escape this, nobody will lend him the money and he doesn't have the cash!! Get it!! He's done!!
"Make no mistake"  That did not age well ROFLMAO  And a foreign entity? Well, that does not hold well for national security, does it?  When you say foreign entity, just be honest and say "Russia and Saudi"
Just pay up
this didnt age well :D
He just has to ask jarred to give him the money! He could not get any equity on his building because they are leveraged!
So why is he not coming up with the payments?.....Forges post all this "evidence" but WHY IS HE NOT COMING UP WITH THE PAYMENTS?!
Trump's head of finace Alan Weisselberg was caught committing perjury when Forbes informed Judge Engeron that Weisselberg lied in court. What Weisselberg had told Forbes was very different from what he told the court about his Trumpian finacial dealings. So how does Forbes know for sure what percentage of Trump's many properties are actually owned by him. My guess is that they are all part owned by Russian oligarchs and Putin via a proxy.
Forbes is full it, they never checked on Trumps financial situation just accepted his lies about his financial condition and we know he  cant post bond. 😅
Joke
Sorry Forbes cult followers.  He couldn't come up with the money.  And who in their right mind would borrow this criminal pathological liar a penny?
I dont even know why I click on Forbes anymore. I guess it's just for a good groan and laugh.
That doesn't mean he should fork them over to corrupt entities.
assuming their are no claims against his properties
Wow, Forbes is a complete joke. You guys have fun.
No good if he owes 4 billion in mortgages.  Lol 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Haaa... THIS JUST IN!  TRUMP'S NEDIA BUSINESS PARTNERS HAVE FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST HIM AND HIS SHARE AMOUNTS!!  LOL!  So you can forget about that media deal!  Instead send him your rent money, your grocery money, your prescription money, and your kid's school lunch money!!!   🤣🤣🤣😅
What about his old tax con on the way.
Well, this garbage was proven wrong instantly. Hes already confessed that he doesnt have the cash. And nobody will give him a loan. Lol.
Liar
This sounds more like fake news
Well, this aged like a bloated tuna washed up on the beach.  It stinks to high heaven
he has already paid i guess. And he als does not need foreign money for campaining. obviously.
Ha!
GREAT NEWS 👉😎👍👌✨ BUT he owes the state NOTHING ZERO ZIP !!!
So don't give him ANY of your money. Putin will bail him out
This analysis is so faulty. The valuations of Maralargo and golf courses are invalid because of their zoning and restrictions. If he actually owns condos in those buildings mentioned are vacant, they’re unsellable. In any case, the announcement yesterday of only having $100 million kinda puts the lie to these numbers. And selling into a distressed market if liquidating makes them a buyer’s delight and likely reduces the price by 20% or more…not to mention what’s left after debt secured by those buildings is deducted!
#Forbes i thought that you were trustworthy... BUT when he himself says ONLY 100 Mil. on hand, and cant pay ANY of the courts verdicts, he even tried to HIDE some of his assets in California, but was cought.... I dont think, ANYONE would put up his bonds, UNLESS they can get security, on the double amount, AND there is his "known" way to, NOT hold his word or Agreement/contract, as long he can win on it....  Sry Forbes... Dont think ANYONE is up to put 1/2 Billion up, for a conman, who is known by, what the most "american" wont vote for, an extremist politician...
Ooooops - got that wrong now didn't we LOL
Sounds like Forbes are going to secure the bond
How many of those buildings are really owned by Russian billionaires?
This is the most politically biased video I’ve seen. Forbes are spineless SOABs
It's gross that Democrats are getting away with this for obviously partisan BS.
For the people who can't stand the truth go back to watching msnbc! Nov 5th isn't going to be your cup of tea!! MAGA baby!!
I think it's safe to say that not all U.S. banks are headquartered in New York. The Governor and her minions are clearly acting like contemptuous dictators. What if all concerned citizens withdrew their funds and/or closed their accounts from the financial institutions that are? Thoughts to ponder, don't you think?
Ha ha he said today he is broke?????
Lol
All butthurt libs in these comments wait for the boomerang when he wins on appeal and sues the pants off the State of New York
Forbes has been swallowing Trump's forever. This is all bullshit.
I call b.s.
Such a shame Forbes reporters were not called in as "expert witnesses" during the trial😆
half truths are still lying.
Even with collateral not many serious lenders want to be associated with him.
Forbes is full of --it!
Dude you are using Trumps fantasy numbers.
😂😂😂😂😂
This video aged well in a whopping 48 hours.
Well that didn't age ONE DAY well. @Forbes is complicit in the lies
Because he can get a loan from his bank.....
Irish Golf Course valued at $24.64m .....cant see Scotland being approx. $70m...    Doesn't make sense
Are you kidding me.  What a travesty you are trying to propagate— this is so much BS you are peddling
Buddy you don't know what your talking about.
Look at the DA’s balance sheet.
I know the answer...Eric said years ago, we can get all the money we need from Russia...All we need.
Then why isn’t he doing it? 😂
Forbes is a victim of Epstein blackmail?
Forbes is a make-believe world that likes to pander to the ego of those it features
Would anyone lend money to a person who may be in jail soon?
He's not gonna have to come up with that money anyway, it's gonna get overturned.
How does it feel to be proved wrong just hours after posting your video?
That could be an underestimate if Mar-a-Lago comes with cardboard boxes included.
What? $27 million mortgage free? Not counting liens and loans on those properties? Come on, The King of Debt? Forbes schmorbes.
I would advise All business owners to leave NYC. Even Adams said Americans citizens are not welcome there. Get out before it goes down.
Forbes it's just like watching Fox News
Bullshit forbes
Well this is bullsh*t.
I'm so happy  about that ❤
Cope harder. It's like Forbes needs that YouTube money, because I can't understand how they consistently get things wrong with their bold claims. The man himself has said he will need to sell off stuff, yet here we are. Which of the Trumps did you consult with before making this video?
He’s the lower case king of debt.
Try as they might, it’s a bump in the road for him. No one ever talks about how many people are employed by him and what positive economic impact it has.
🤣🤣🤣 He doesn't have to pay anything
😂😂😂He just offered the courts $100 bond (not even a liquid assets), so he clearly worth less than that 😂😂😂
Shame on NY AG!
What a load of BS Forbes ! He just admitted he can't pay and then there is the daily interest if wants to appeal he has to secure 5 hundred mill as a bond. M.largo is not worth what u say omg Forbes u should be charged as a co conspiritor u still lie about his worth and property  values ur just as criminal as him. So many inaccurate  opinions  Forbes.
0:56  *FAKE Newz*
Seems like all his assets have charges on them already.  No one will back him so he is pleading he has to sell assets.  Does not help him that no one actually trusts him.
Decent Americans pity the three women Justices who form the helpless minority in a Supremacist Court that has gone rogue. The majority of six MAGA Justices have joined the White-Nationalist conspiracy to replace our democracy with a pseudo-Christian dictatorship. They deserve our contempt and condemnation. SHAME ON THEM!
Not buying it, guess time will either prove me right, or wrong
So, his own motion to be relieved of his need to post casj ir a bond becsuse he cant get the cash are a lie?  Thanks for clarifying that
Then why is he bitching about his inability to pay? Let him pay up or shut up.😢
Well this was wrong. As on Wed, he's said he hasn't got the money. So wrong again. Give up and have acsleep.
these statements are false
properties are all mortgaged to the hilt and he does not have even close to 400 million in funds. he is allowed to borrow from a bank as they lifted that for now.
Boy, this is some real garbage reporting full of lies.
That didn't age well. Are you good at anything?
Biden corruption will not win.
The orange cheeto puff learned a new word. "Liquidate"
oops...Forbes got it WRONG again....dumps attorneys just admitted he doesnt  have the money
Forbes loves the Donald so much they would lie and call him King. They should pay his fines.
A so-called billionaire that can not come up with a bond.  🤔
I avoid opinions of the FORBES CRIME FAMILY.
FORBES HAVE YOU NOT HEARD??????
Yet he doesn't post bond... Sure thing Forbes
Or he can pardon himself.
I call BS. 😂
40/60% dislike ratio if anyone wondering
Ah, yes, Forbes and its made up garbage estimates.
HA ! HA !HA ! HA !HA ! HA !HA ! HA !HA ! HA !HA ! HA !HA ! HA !HA ! HA !HA ! HA !HA ! HA !HA ! HA ! WOW, Youns is smart!
Potential buyers are already smelling the desperation, he will lose highly!
Apparently he doesn’t have the cash 😮😮😮😮
offs u guys , he doesnt have enough
Wow, you guys certainly disagree with most other expert commentators!!!!!!!  Maybe Forbes should be re-named "Fibs" ??
Hilarious! Mad Magazine stuff. 😂
Let's see what is wrong with this picture. Trump's lawyers just said he is unable to come up with the bond which contradicts what is being said here. The possibility s that he is already over-leveraged with mortgages on top of mortgages and they are not willing to mortgage his property again. Since he is high risk to default.Tota bull. I guess facts do not matter anymore.
🤣🤣🤣 lets see if what you are saying is true.
It seems he won't have to seel them because he is NOT coming up with $540 Million for his appeal!
Forbes "Daily Briefing". Heh heh you mean the Forbes Daily Load of BS.
No,,,,he doesn't 😅😅😅😅😅😅
He just doesn’t want to pay it because if he gets into office…
Forbes should lend him the money
So why is he not paying it ? Pride ?
Liar liar
Why do I not believe a word of this?
Who wrote this script? Junior after a coke binge?
🤣sure...let Alina help with that ? 🤣
Is this satire? Mar-A-Lago is worth 300 million? on what planet?
He won’t have to pay anything because it will be overturned. Simple as that.
@forbes hate to break it to you bud but that net worth was inflated too.
Seems if he wins the appeal, then the State will have to pay back the fines plus interest, no? And as the appeal may take time the State could be on the hook for double or more of the $100 million in interest on the fines and he could come out financially better off than before! Don't be surprised if it happens.
Forbes, why did you turn off the comments on the Dylan Mulvaney interview? Comments were the best part.
lol @ Forbes being completely wrong
It´s terrifieing that you don´t seem to know ANYTHING. I thought you are running a sort of business,financial magazin, that must be a false information as well. The whole video and the numbers are ,what DT personally prefers - a big fat lie.
Total BS. I'll never watch Forbes again.
How can a property worth 18 Mio here be valued around 300 Mio? The whole process was about these inaccurate values you repeat here..
Prosecution of political opponents. Shouldn't have to pay anything for a honest business deal 🤝 where everyone agreed and was happy. Democracy...
Fake we all know
Who would loan Donnie any money after swindling the banks?!
He just said the in luquid (cash basically) he has about $100 mil, so it means that he gotta find $400 mil
He broke. 😂😂😂
Forbes needs to be sued. Valuation by Forbes are typically based on false information as told by liars.   Forbes lies.
Forbes estimates are totally trash. Forbes valued my ex boss to be worth USD 2.1B. In actual fact, he was worth south of USD 400 million. Excellent job in inflating his EGO and nothing more. Lol. We shall see
So Mara logo went from 27 million to 300 million
What’s wrong with Forbes? Lying perhaps?
But hes's asking to lower his Bond to 100 million? If he's so confident that he's going to win his appeal and has all these ways to pay. Why does't he just put up the bond?
In all seriousness, look into who has been trying to acquire  Forbes and it'll tell you everything you need to know.
Forbes and John Barron, aehm, cough, cough, DJ T, have had a very special relationship over the last few decades.  😂
His properties are so heavily leveraged that any sale will put him in the red with taxes. And he's a giant walking fire sale, he's not going to get anything near what NY valued his portfolio. Come on, I'm not in finance and I know that! He's toast.
BS.. bookmark this video till next month when he defaults.
This video is just plain wrong.
Forbes is out of date and out of touch - irrelevant
Garbage assessment by garbage Forbes.  TLDR: Maybe someone could borrow him cash. NO ONE WILL BORROW HIM HALF A BILLION DOLLARS! He doesn't have friends and Russia is kinda indisposed.  He can't mortgage his assets as no one will lend him cash - he owes money cause he OVERVALUED THOSE ASSETS. By the time they are reassessed they will already be UP FOR AUCTION. Garbage Forbes. GAR-BAGE!
I don't think so.
Wow Forbes is just another piece of Trump's propaganda puzzle. Whatever his assets are 540 million is a nice bite of his ill gotten gains fortune.
Surely theres many people now that could start boycotting these golf courses and hotels so their value plummets.
Ummm... You were saying... Geeze, 1 day is all it took to make you look so foolish?
Why would he be losing $114,000  a day with all those options?
Unbelievable that Trump's 10 golf courses are worth ONLY 250 million and his penthouse only 52 million.
Guess Forbes has no clue of what they talk about
You are wasting current.😮😮😮
You are bshitting.
Trumps golf course in Ireland is literally in the middle of nowhere about an hour from a city of 100,00 and 3 hours from Dublin only accessible by car. That site, even with Ireland's insane land prices would only be worth around 5 million. It's crazy remote. So unless Scotlands courses are somehow worth 42 million each in a country where land is 2/3 of the cost of Ireland. Forbes estimates are not based on reality.
Even if he had the money to pay, which I doubt, he would prefer to use campaign donations to pay his debts and legal fees.
Good luck diaper don
Either way. It is going to hurt his ego aunus to the point hes going to cry like a baby
300 mil for maralago.... that must be the figure for mortgage/borrowing purposes. Wasn't it 27mil for tax purposes?
Forbes, not surprised you can't hit 2Million. You think it could be the BS you buy into?
well it will be interesting to see if Forbes knows what they're talking about. Last i read mar a lago  wasn't worth that much because its a histroical site or something like that. So it can't be developed. Oh well a wait and see approach
Putin will put the bond up
Forbes is in Trumps pocket too and its disgusting, why I feel they have lost credibility.
No he does not have to sell because his criminal buddies will help him as they always do.   That’s how it goes with mob bosses
5 bucks each from his voter's....No worries, we got his back..
how come he didnt come up with the money
Because he has $10 billion and just got 4 billion lately
So what’s the hold up? Why did he put up $100 million only falsified papers again. How do we know his name is on those deeds. What you don’t know the bank owns a lot of his property you don’t owe me nothing unless it’s paid for.
The cost to keep America free is getting more and more expensive. When the government has the edge (the leftist), it goes after its billionaires to keep from anything coming in its way. I hope we get this right this time.
He's guilty so he'll never see whatever he put up again
that's amazing that you could translate all those words said on this video, using only bootlicker(Forbes favorite language)
It's sad that people defend clear Democrat corruption.
he doesn't own any of them... that's why he won't have to sell.
Dude running for president borrowing large sums of foreign money to cover legal woes…this tracks
Yes he will have to sell.
lol! Don the con is broke as of today. Forbes why you lying? NY should send in the repo men and take everything.
1. Borrow from a foreign entity? If he becomes presidemt he's now a liability.  2. All properties with no mortgage? I don't buy it  3. Loans? Who's gonna loan him cash knowing he's gonna file bankruptcy and you'll never see it
3:00 there it is. Im sure russia will come through for their big orange boy 😂
a lot of "could haves" in this speculation..
Funny how all the geniuses in math came out of the woodwork. Save for your own tax season that we are all about to take a hit lol!
This article is already out of date.
Maybe Forbes knows that he get cash from his boss putin
Literally said he doesn’t have the money. How’s that egg on your face taste?
This aged pretty quickly 😂
;)
The numbers are easily debatable, but the general info in this piece is helpful. Bottom line IMO is DJT won't be facing bankruptcy again, at least in the near term.  Odds say he'll still be financially solvent after incarceration.
He will still be in dept paying interest🤩😟
Laugh now people. Wait till you see the end tho!
I remember when Forbes was a news source that was respected, and could be trusted because of the level of journalism it maintained. Now they are the new Fox news. Just a mouthpiece for Fascism.
All these false verdicts are a bunch BS. New York is so corrupt
He won't have to sell any buildings because New York will confiscate and sell them for him ! 😅
Forbes has this way wrong.
He will just lie and get another loan.
That was funny!!! 😂😂😂
🤣
This didn't age well (only 1 day)  Did Forbes true up it's estimate to align with the fraud?
As Oversight Committee said today Sick and Tired of being sick and tired!!  Forbes, FOX, AVVO etc...stop the lies !
He doesn't OWE the state anything. This DA and judge are vindictive criminals.
This just does not ring true.
He could only come up with $100 million today.
That should pi$$ off the “D.A. “
Lots and lots of variables at lay here, none of which were really discussed. Nice try, though. I'm sure some people will buy this BS you're selling.
Wow, this is childish. No one believes you.
It’s a conundrum of irony that only books, movies, and historical documentaries can truly explain. He’s accused of lying about his worth and so the only way to disprove it and pay the penalties judged against him is to borrow against it. If successful he will disprove the accusations and, well, the penalties post-paid will have been found false. If unsuccessful, he’ll simply be broke, recognized as a liar, and whatever comes next. In chess words, he’s been “checked”.
Forbes covering up criminal and shady financial maneuvers.  1st What legitimate bank would loan a person just convicted of Fraud to borrow unless it's one of those money laundering banks like  Deutch Bank, or the Saudis who already bailed him out in exchange for selling the country out.  Anyway, FORBES doing what FORBES does.
Why would you pay off debts you are appealing? That makes absolutely no sense.
This didn't age well
very biased narration
I love all the financial experts giving professional advice on a YouTube comment section! Tremendous!
If he has that much $$. Why would he lie to get loans? He's no doubt been scamming the system for decades. Anyone else would be under the prison borrowing money he doesn't really have. Most of those properties he borrowed/stole lied about his worth to build. A ponsy scene. The world's best crook 😂😂😂
The wealthy unrighteousness screw everybody over for the benefit of self gain.  God sees right thru your fiscal idolatry worship!
Upper courts need to step in at some point. These vendetta style lawsuits are filed for 1 reason.. to attempt to break him and force him out of the election.  TDS runs deep in blue cities.
Just write the check, Donald, you filthy-rich billionaire! You do have the money, don't you?
TRANSPARENT REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN INTERFERENCE BY DEMOCRATS
I don’t think it is anybody’s business what he does.
8th amendment
the fines will be eliminated on appeal.
Short shelf life. Your hoax math spoiled within 24 hours.
Because it’s a violation if the 8th amendment.
Leticia James we want to see your “Low Income Apartment “😂😂😂
Both judgments are on appeal. He has to come up with a bond for the State of NY for that $450 million which I would guess based on his assets would not be hard to obtain. Also, while these are in appeal the money goes to escrow to be returned to him if he should win the appeals.
Hi Haters!
No one would loan that much for an adjudged fine I think. If he defaults, they know they’d be tied up in court forever trying to collect the collateral I bet.
Wrong again Forbes 😂
This video did not age well since yesterday.
And a bridge
He can't borrow 💩
He just admitted today in an appeal filing that he only has 100 million in liquid assets... forbes must still be going off of the fraudulent statement of financial condition.
He will never have to pay that BS lawsuit.
LOL. Do you seriously believe he has that much money?  He has no money, that’s why the gullible have been paying his legal bills.
Too late now. He can’t pay it
Dear Forbes, Almost everything in this video was wrong or misleading. Please stop pretending to know things.
Why/ Because he will not need to come up with the $ as the appeal will be very successful.
😂😂😂 best joke told today
lol. You are going by his statements of worth.  This video undermines the credibility of your magazine.  All those valuations are based on disproven assertions.
He won't need to sell any of his assets to pay the bills, once the money he made selling our Nuclear secrets comes out the laundry...lol
Even having the assets, it’s pretty tough to get a loan that large in 30 days.
He’s just going to go to another bank in another state and go exactly what he was fined for in NY. He’ll have the funds and the case will get over turned. If not, he’ll make the money another way and Ny will be the one who suffers.
What he could borrow against Mara lago? It’s worth 300 million? I thought it was only worth 18 million 🤔   We live in a simulation
He won't pay them a dime. Lol this will get killed on appeal
He's been found liable for fraud, I doubt theyll give him a loan without loan shark rates. That's robbing a bank, getting out of prison for doing so, then asking the same bank for a loan.
Forbes needs to improve their research department … they are grossly misinformed
Bullcrap they are all Mortgaged to the hill your figures are ridiculous
Here comes that Saudi money
Could he call putin ?
New York State SHAKEDOWN CONTINUES !
YOU GUYS ARE ADORABLE! You mean the Forbes valuation that used Trump’s fraudulent statements?!? 😂❤😂
Didn't he just file with the court that he couldn't come up with the money for the bond required to appeal the verdict?
He will just file for bankruptcy like he has many times before.
Go secure his bond then, Forbes.
Worth 2.6 billion and has to hock cheap sneakers to his followers. What a crook.
Bold statements to make about someone who can't afford their appeal bonds.
Just one day later, this "insightful" Forbes analysis is not aging well.
Man, you guys were really full of it.
Simple. He won't have to a dime to ny. Or Jean e carrol
Forbes is as fake as Fox News now. Spewing out lies!
This didn't age well
And who is going to lend him this $540 million dollars? LOL!
This aged poorly, Trump's lawyers said that he'd have to do a fire sale if he had to put up more than $100 million in that massive appeal they filed.
So when he filed that he could only pay 100 million,was that cuz he cant afford to pay it or he doesnt want to?
Then why hasn't he posted the bond? Is he counting on donors and Foreign supporters?  Market to market accounting Enron Style? Yea, don't believe you..........
In order to file an appeal, you must post a bond in the amount of the judgement. The courts won't recognize the appeal otherwise. This is the type of shenanigans which got judgements against him in the first place. Putin might give him a "loan", probably has a few times already.
There's no way the ridiculous excessive fine will hold up in court, so it doesn't even matter how much free cash he has. As usual, The Donald will get the last laugh at all these deranged, corrupt leftists.
This is laughably wrong.
So does estimate fall in line with those of Sam Bankman-Fried & Elizabeth Holmes?  You said the where going to revolutionize the world, but instead turned out to be frauds. You seem to like to cover up for scammers.  Are you getting cut in on these deals or just boot licking because you can?
$540M is just the start ... if he borrows from Banks they can seize his assets if he defaults.  Borrowing is a fools game and Forbes knows it ... odd that Forbes seems to approach Trump's financial issues with "he can pay" rather than "why is the fool wasting money" ... isn't Forbes about wealth and increasing wealth rather than defending criminals with "he can pay it"?
Well, this was hilariously wrong. He literally just appealed the court to pay $100mm instead of $400mm. Forbes has no clue on actually measuring wealth. And no NYC-chartered bank is going to give him a mortgage
Who told you he has 400 million in cash??   🤣
County tax assessors should reassess Trump’s holdings based on Forbes calculations?
Fan01 .... see down the page.
Reciprocity!!  The republicans can now justifiably sue, imprison and bankrupt democratic organizations and institutions with vigor!!
Riiiiight.  You should have waited 24 hrs, to find the flaws in your report. One more gaffe like this, and you're blocked back to merely being a spanking magazine.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowed Donald Trump's media and technology company to merge with a blank-check acquisition vehicle in a deal that currently values the parent of his social media app Truth Social at as much as $10 billion.
Only fools will fall for this forbes report. It was designed to put trumpers at ease!! Reality is opposite -  The orange nightmare in in trouble
What can I say, the World's all about business.
The best is that they're stupid and he's a business genius...❤
Well, Mar a Lago is worth 7 or 8 billion, and his New York properties are worth 900 billion.  His golf courses are all worth hundred billion each.
Because he will win his appeal
Std be clear. This reporter says that maralago is worth close to 300 mill.  This disproves the main argument in the case they are discussing where the judge said it’s only worth a couple hundred thousand. The missing part of this report is that all these cases going to appeal will be over turned. And items like this news report will be used to prove the judge is wrong. And trust me, the NY supremacy court is not going to risk losing more business.
There is zero chance Trump's properties haven't been put up as collateral for a bunch of debt already.
the way it seems he will have to call NY so they tell him how much to value his properties at the time of filling out the loan application
BREAKING NEWS: Forbes no longer a reputable news source.
Trying so hard to normalize this Orange Lunatic. Not a chance in the general... Sad!
anything on paper is nothing compared with the assets he hid across the world, not to mention his voters who are chipping in to help the multi billionaire.  His bubble contains all of the owners of banks to take up the slack.  It's really a joke and his voters are falling for it, just like the steal.
Finding a bank that will loan him the money is going to be an issue.
Let me guess . Another scam how to send money to uhraine 😂🤣😂
how are #14 in trending for this?  lol, solar flares got them reptiles on the computer algos all messed up... funny as f
Garbage
He won’t have to sell any building because he really doesn’t Own any Building. He’s leased just about every thing by putting his name on it more often than not. At most he’s a partial owner in some things…
He shouldn't have to sell anything to satisfy these totally unjust judgments against him. Totally biased & corrupt prosecution and judge. NY ripped the blindfold off Lady Justice to render this miscarriage of justice. Not guilty!
this was really done poorly, i love how basically between the music and the narrator yer basically saying this guy is untouchable and like dont worry about it.. ok check
BS
Will this video age well? Time will tell
Then why could he only muster $100 million today?
Just a other right wing lying machine
Maybe he will be bailed out by some of those uber rich, conservative billionaire buddy's of his.  BUT you can safely bet it won't be George Soros. lol
Why not put it then. All these assets valued as it says are probably "increased"
This didn’t age well!
Clown post by Forbes.
why wouldn't he use a bond?
Boy, are you wrong
LOL - Forbes, you are WAY off the mark!  Good old diaper don just admitted, in court, that he does not have the $$ to pay up.
The difference from the uk leadership and Biden...   Nothing...  Coke and money...   Same dreams..  biotching about a short bag lmfao...
Of course he doesn't have to sell any properties if they are SEIZED. The seizures are the payment.
He’s essentially said that he can’t afford the bond. He’s failed to secure the bond and has “counter offered” a bond for $100m. He’s seeing nearly $100k a day in interest and if he fails to secure the bond, they will seize his bank accounts and then move to his assets.
Putin will throw some Russian Rubles into one of Trump's offshore accounts.
LOL. Uh... yeah... today his lawyers said that he can't pay the bill.  So... yeah. Forbes has ZERO idea how to read a con-man's balance sheet. Which is exactly how he ripped off everyone and how he got himself into this mess in the first place.
Mara Lago is only worth 25 million,  not 300 and the 400 mil. in liquid assets is also  grossly overstated given his cash crunch where he can't afford lawyers. This accounting also doesn't take into account other current unpaid debt including pending judgments,  and,  there's no bank in the world willing to loan him money since Deutsche Bank withdrew. This article is an ad for Forbes subscriptions and deliberately misrepresents the facts in order to generate interests among new customers.
He won't have to sell any property because it's going to get overturned. it's really that simple. 350 million + no victim = it'll get taken all the way up to the supreme court if need be. He'll only be paying lawyer fees which i'm sure he has a few on retainer anyway.
I think the banks are going to do more due diligence this time.
WRONG!  On February 28, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM EST he has admitted he does NOT have the liquid assets to pay his debts!  Looks like Forbes is wrong AGAIN as he will have to sell his buildings afterall, …just saying 😅
He borrows, he has to pay!  How is his credit score?  Lmao
Good thing, because his properties aren't worth 1/100th of what he says they're worth.
Forbes …this is fictional BULLSHIT.
With dark clouds over Trump's head, his properties and his brand has greatly dropped in value and falling like a cement block
Denial this page has
because his cult will give him the money... because hes so rich and doesnt need it.
Why not go after Joe and Hunter Bribem. The real criminals
Trump's lawyers , today says he doesn't have the money to pay it. He said he only has 100 million. So he will have to start selling his assets. No one would loan him the 4 million he had to pay E Jean Carroll, who's going to loan him 500 Million. Fire sale in New York !
forbes i would like to sell you a gold pair of sneakers for only 5. …13 million dollars. What a steal right?
Decades ago, as a young investor, I knew Forbes to be a well-regarded and accurate information source. But now....
You lie outright!
Soooooooo the filing came out today buddy. Here, hold this L 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Videos like this are the reason YouTube removed showing dislikes.
This video aged badly....and it has only been one day. 😂 😆
How did Forbes ever wind up in the same category as NewsMax and Fox?  Kind of sad.
If the people at Forbes always been this stupid?
He just filed asking if he could only pay $100 million to stop collection on the judgment. He doesn't have the cash. Y'all don't have a good record of estimating his assets. When Forbes put him on the billionaires list, the philanthropic community just laughed. We all knew from screening his ability to be able to give a major gift that he didn't have the money he said he did. He was found to be a person that would be a waste of our time as he is not philanthropic at all. This video is laughable.
Forbes is likely bailing him out for “valuable consideration”, copying the success of Deutsch Bank. Give or take a couple billion.
Ya, the government will do it for him 😂😂😂😂😂
Unfortunately Forbes track record on financial matters esp predictions is worse than your own guesses.
Forbes is a joke 😂😂
Can we sue Forbes over this obvious piece of propaganda?
I bet hes not going to pay anything either way
Amazing all the crybaby cnn talking point sad little democrats on here that think they got him this time.  The thing is you must be a sad person to hate someone so much because the media told u too that u will justify anything they do to him no matter how much they show u their doing it for personal vendetta's and r breaking and bending laws ti get him with packed judges and juries.
I hate what N.Y. is doing to him. What they sow they will reap. NYC is gone.
How the heck is he going to get a loan. Wasn't tht the point.. Committing fraud?!don't know wht you're talking about. It all his own fault it was all beyond egregious and he still wants to play power games. It's boring now
News said through his “offer” today that he cannot afford what he has marched into through his debt ridden escapades. I am doubting that his portfolio is honestly represented as represented by this YT post. He is being cornered and any entity that lends assets to him for his legal and otherwise personal (his and his “family”) costs. There is enough news…and proof…that he is a bad financial risk for all the latter and he may ultimately learn that the “rats” have taken over the ship and tossed him overboard. Not the best news for USA citizens however. Because the money invested by those most at-risk in supply side economics is positioning politics to favor them by utilizing every “weapon” at their disposal. The end result is an authoritarian empire where citizens serve the (history shows) temporary princes and princesses of avarice, wealth, power and influence.
Sounds like Forbes is stroking Trump's ego to me
"He could theoretically borrow money against one or more of the 27 mortgage-free properties in his portfolio, which are collectively worth more than $1.1 billion."  From what bank? It would have to be a bank with no office in NYC that is clueless about his past dealings with not paying back loans. What bank would be foolish enough to loan him money?
Don't believe the lie!!  He'll be worth much less!
The math isn't mathing, but the cope is coping
He gave forbes the info
Lol did you see todays news orangeman cant make the bond! Lol
Why would he borrow with a debt? That’s awful! I would sale the property and pay the debt
Probably because he will be in the black and brown communities selling his new cheaply made sneakers…
And if you believe that, you must be a true maga.
That's good, he will keep getting more cases to pay up.....if so why is he avoiding to pay?
Sure, uh huh.
Forbes is committing journalistic malpractice as usual to cover up their complicity in Donald Trump's behavior.
Forbes believes a congenital, habitual liar's statements of financial health and strength.  And yet, just today DUMP's attorneys offered only a $100 million bond to cover his exposure of almost $500 million which was completely denied.  Why is that Forbes? A man who YOU claim could whip out a pen and write a check for all he owes but he will not.  Maybe you're wrong, Forbes   Maybe you're spewing DUMP's misinfo and disinfo program for him.  You're in a cult, Forbes.
Dude can sell out of 400$ sneakers in less than an hour.  If signs the sneakers, they are 9K each.  Wait until the Jacket comes out.  Commies are gonna lose their minds.
He shouldnt have to do anything...it was a kangaroo court with a couple of Clown ....
😂the whole point is that he lied about his property values, so we don’t know what they’re worth. He’ll never beg another billionaire because it would make him look bad, and since it was banks he defrauded, they’re not going to loan him money…
Don’t believe everything Forbes says
Uh yeah he will he literally doesn’t have the money. Judge is abouta start seizing assets any day now.
Ummm no!
Forbes is owned by the Chinese.  Perhaps President Xi will give him the money.
You’re still using his numbers.
Many of us know Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a Supreme Court opinion that outlined the 8th Ammendment applies to States. An excessive fine violates the 8th Ammendment.
And just one day later, your reporting proved to be wrong again....
Sad state of politics in our country.
Won't have to sell them because he isn't guilty
All lies 😂😂😂
Thanks for the update. Now they should definitely make him pay the full amount
what sane country forces successful businessmen to liquidate its well run business in order to please few local haters? What about people who work there, there will be kicked out so less revenue for cash starved NYS. Sick and cruel and shows you the amount of pure hatred in politics, nothing else. You can not run on hatred for a long time history showed us that.
Wrong.  He only has $100 million per Trump's attorneys filing.  And he can't appeal until he puts up the money.
Why hasn't he paid, if he can?
Hes not going to have to pay for any of it after the appeals thats just the way it is he will be back in office by then most likley and pardon himself of any wrong doing if he did anything out of the ordinary from the beggining from my understanding he didnt do anything any other businessman hasnt done to me its politcal prosecution whether you like him or not the current powers that be are going after him not because of justice or protecting democracy but because he is their greatest threat
I dont think money is a problem
😂😂😂😂 Forbes is so right wing now they can't get their facts straight. They should start following Meidas Touch so they can actually know what is going on in the 'LEGAL' standpoint. He already cried (wah wah wah) he didn't have the money.. I am leaning very far to the fact that more than likely the new filing he asked won't stop the inevitable.. the Interest on the outstanding amounts is mounting up daily to crazy amounts. School yourself Forbes Newsmax and Tucker are not reliable FACTS sources
Guess Forbes will be indicted for overstating values now in NY too 😂
The self proclaimed “King of Debt” doesn’t have nearly as much money as claimed.
Forbes…. Donald named his most recent spawn after the fake character he made up to dimly trick your publication into adding him to your richest people list.  Your numbers are as bullshit.
This video aged like fine milk
Well this is already wrong! Lol. One day later.
Because he didn't do any wrong ...
Keep dreaming.
Forbes must not be aware that he just offered only $100,000,000 as his bond. He is not as rich as Forbes thinks
BS. Chump doesn't own most of the buildings mentioned. He owns the "branding." Deutsch Bank is the only bank that will do any business with Chump and that's because it's owned by Russian oligarchs. They're not giving any more loans though as Putin has severed links with stinky. The appelate court will refuse his demands and stinky won't be able to appeal and will lose the majority of his remaining wealth. The only thing left will be more grifting of his minions. Loving it immensely.
So inaccurate.
We ALL shall see , soon enough
Trump's balance sheet are strong enough according to who, Forbes? The guy who just got convicted of fraud.
What a bunch of BS
This aged like milk on a hot day...
Forbes is pathetic
This aged well...
88 million is being in appeals.
The FORCE of DARKNESS
Apparently things change since he has announced he “ain’t” got the money…
Who's giving a loan to a guy that was JUST found guilty of fraud for misreporting the values of property to his debtors? Good luck to him.
He could ask his l8ver Putin
I didn't even bother watching this when it came out yesterday. Or the day before because it was so obviously b. S and I was right cause today. His lawyers officially filed in court that he doesn't have the money to pay for his bond. That's hilarious. You guys are just full of it
He's broke can't even pay the bond
Wrong, 😂   It just came out in court he admitted he has only 1 million in cash.  His whole portfolio is a lie. Plus the increasing amount of lawsuits put him in more debt.  He was, is, and will always be a conman.  Are you Forbes?
Really? Why hasn’t he.
That'd how NYC is going to pay for all the immigrants
Today he posted one-fifth of the required bond, and he's begging the judge to lower the required amount. We'll see what he can actually come up with. I believe he has 3 weeks to do it, or he won't have to sell anything--Letitia James could begin doing that for him.   We're so sick of monitoring and babysitting this utterly corrupt grifter. Come on November!
This is a strange fluff piece
TRUMPS FAKE FINANCIALS ...AND YOU DID NOT VET OR VALIDATE THEM
I'm calling bs on this puff piece.
Feels weird to watch my first Forbes news video and have it come off like cheap unreliable clickbait, in both style and substance.
The real reason: the kremlin will front him for it, so long as he does their bidding.
Big lie, oen thing is being worth 2.5 billions another have access to it, you talk about borrowing, but no bank will lend him money...
hey yall remember him back in 2015???? TEN BILLION DOLLARS....HAHAHAHAHAHAA. we remember him saying that over and over and over again... we told you he was a liar back than and now you get to see the truth.
The whole thing is just spite work
So he is half a billionaire
I hate this guy. How does he get away way
Of course, he doesn't have to pay for any of it because he isn't guilty of anything. Witch-hunt.
He'll pay the bond, which prevents James from collecting the fine while he files an appeal. If he loses the appeal, the bond pays the fine. If (when) he wins the appeal, he recoups the bond amount and gives James and Enmoron the international hand signal of discontent!, 🖕
Well…it’s official…his lawyers says he does not enough liquid assets…I guess it’s up to the Saudi royals or Putin…
2.6B? He might not have that much worth given all the lies and fraud he's done.
maralargo is worth $300mil?  and 10 golf courses are worth $250mil?  this is not a smart take
Forbes is crazy or lying.
This is worthless article and didn't age beyond 24hrs.
LOL
After the fraud case, I got a feeling that the number of banks that don't do business with NY is about to skyrocket.
This aged like milk.
He sold the property in Hawaii
If true, why can't he make bond?
Forbes is over rated. he needs to be held accoubtable all if his crimes just like anyone else
This is a great Man and the best President we have ever had in this Country !!!
PayDay loans, here he comes
We know he won’t have to sell a building to pay that illegal fine because it’s an illegal court judgement.
You mean, other than the fact he wont have to pay a dime once this gets to an actual court and not a clown show?
Why is that anyones business, oh it’s not stop your drama.
Pretty sure it's coming from Putin, via Harlan Crow and SCJ Thomas......
Interesting in light of Trump’s lawyers’ representations in court today.
Can’t that criminal get away from the US forever and ever and ever !
😂 thats why he asked to pay 1 million
He won't be paying a thing bc America isn't a communist country. You can't throw ppl in prison bc you disagree with their politics. Just like the russia collusion hoax, this too will FAIL.
Your math anit mathing
You're basing this off of Trump's financials? And we ALL know that his financial records are gospel, don't we?
Forbes is a joke like fox News or news Nation tyt they are all wrong all the time they either lie do not know what they are doing and cenk from fake news tyt is a big whiney baby
So why has he told the court he doesn't have the money?
Source:  John Barron.
This aged like milk. Trumps attorneys just admitted he can't afford to pay lol
Good old forbes, lips firmly stitched to the asses of the Republican party
...fake shoes.
Trump's appeal said he would have to sell assets to cover the bond.  He's admitting it.  He doesn't want to do that.  He is saying he has only $100M in cash.  Research more.  There are loans on all of it and taxes, etc.  Way off.  Who writes this stuff?
Adorable propaganda, considering literally the REASON he owes millions right now is BECAUSE of false valuations of those properties.
Undoubtedly there's Top Secret documents for sale.
Lol this aged bad. Fast to. He literally just filed that he doesn't have the money to pay
Banks will loan him $450M+ with his properties as collateral.  No doubt the banks will value those properties much higher than the judge just did.  This will then be used in his appeal to win.
You didn't mention the GoFundMe that took in over $400M
He’s trying to negotiate with a $100 million bond. He’s doesn’t  seem to want to borrow against his property or can’t. He’s waiting for you to pay.
He also has millions of poor people willing to chip in to bail him out.
This aged like milk.
Of course he won't personally pay anything. He will get the money from the RNC when his daughter in law takes over, and from "investments" by Mohammed bin Salman in exchange for more weapons deals.  If he has to sell Mar A Lago, he will have to go through all of the bathrooms and closets for classified documents that he hasn't sent to his boss (Vladimir Putin) yet.
He just admitted in court filings that he doesn’t have the money
I don’t believe this
Hahahaha. NOT!!!
Well…he won’t have to pay a dime.
Laughable, he only claim up with 100 million, total bs… Forbes is full of it.
Forbes trying to save face - point blank. Stop supporting them.
So, you're suggesting that the con man raise the money by doing exactly what he was fined all that money for doing? I thought Forbes was run by intelligent people, guess not.
Ridiculous
He probably doesn’t really own any of those properties. They’re leveraged to the hilt. He has no money his own.
Whoopsies!
The commie left in this country has to be gotten under control. They are the real trouble in America.
You sure about the values on his properties? They were real consistent about their values (not) that’s is the essence for the problems that got him here.. duh.
This BS isn't aging well and it's only been one day.  He doesn't have the money and unless he finds a bank outside of NY he's not getting a loan. Every one can see the writing on the wall. Would you lend money to a guy who's mouth puts him in $100s of millions of dollars of debt. As Marco once said, "Good Luck."
‘Well, we don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.’
Forbes is so full of 💩
lots of more fines on the way - dollars to doughnuts
So, let's all send him $2 dollars each, better than sending a trillion to corrupt oligarchs in Ukraine and to the military industrial complex elites and its investors.
Forbes has no idea, no bank wants anything to do with that grifter.
😉 Sure, he can easily raise the capital through numerous mortgaged-free properties that he owns, get help from Ivanka and Jared, his in-laws the Kushners, who are worth billions themselves, or better yet, from Saudi Arabia just like how the MBS gave Jared $2B for "investments" and/or from Puttin/Xi for trying to "MAGA" the $25T US economy into the $2.4T of Russia and $17T of China economies.
I guess you made this before he JUST said he doesn't have it😂😂😂😂😅😅
If this is all true then why did he try to get Engoran to wait to file the judgement.
Forbes you are full of bullshit.
Because he doesn't actually own any buildings
Sham lawsuit honestly. How can anyone read that ruling and agree with it?
Now he can focus on selling shoes
so many are saying he doesnt have it, while hardly any are questioning why he actually has to pay it
FORBES = FAUX FAKE NEWS
If he had this so called money that you say he has, then why is it he didn't have the 120 million to make the bond?
LOL DAY LATER YOU WERE wrong lol not even 1| 5th  !
Poor boy didn't cough off the whole bond today so what's up Forbes?
LOL....this video didn't age well LOL
He won't have to sell anything...those estimates are all pending appeal, which means they are WORTHLESS.
Trump’s lawyers beg to differ 😂
this didn't age well....
Maybe he should just give New York real estate instead of cash. In no time at all, the property would be worthless and New York  would have to bear the cost of demolition.
2.6 billion. Hahaha hahaha hahaha!
Comments are gold
Putin will loan it to him
forbes like cnn sht news )
Everyone give this thumbs down. Completely ignores the court findings of fraudulent assessments, also ignores outstanding loans that possibly double Trump's debt. He's in for nearly a billion, all told, and he lets the interest just add on by the millions.
except today he told the judge that he doesn't have the ca$h and only has less than a 5th of what is owed in just this one LOSS! :) LOLOLOL
Looking forward to the appeals, as well as the vanity bonfires of his persecutors
Id sell everything i owned in Ny Every business should move out
Ya right, like any bank in the world is going to give him a loan with the amount of civil and criminal trials ahead of him and a legal defeat on business fraud in New York.  He is not going to be borrowing money this time.
Interesting that Forbes values Maralago at $300m when his property tax appeal two years ago which he signed under penalty of perjury he claimed it was worth $18m. The property tax assessor has an obligation to the citizens of the locality in which the property is seated to collect property tax on its actual value. So if it is worth $300m then he has other problems, like tax fraud and whole lots of property tax is owed and that’s annual tax not a one time deal.
So he can take money from anyone, including foreign entities looking to get a favor from a former or possible president to wipe away his legal problems.  Man, that's not a problem that should be super illegal or anything. Something that anyone not rich would be able to get away with. Hail the rich that rule the world. So much for being, of the common man!
I'll bet you dollars to donuts forbes can't pay for the concrete their walking on
Well, this video didn’t age well, considering Trump’s latest legal filing.
Well we all know today that this video is a lie...😂😂
Yah forbes, this looks real great when just a few hours after  you posted this, Trumps attorneys argued they couldn't pay the whole sum.
Forbes: Played once > Played twice > Rubles on the way. 2024: VOTE OR DIE.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a joke of a video.
Well this didn’t age well, and it’s only been a day 😂. His lawyers just told the judge that he doesn’t have enough money and will have to sell properties to pay his bond!
How do I block this channel from my feed..
Ha ha... come on Forbes. You trust Trump's balance sheet?  Foolish.
Forbes? I stopped Forbes years ago.
when did forbes become fake news?!?!
I think its pretty funny people celebrated his losses in court even though the banks in question have been paid long ago. This is a hit job.
Forbes is using Trump's "give me a loan I'm rich" cooked books not his "I can't pay taxes I'm poor" cooked books.
A key point with these mortgage paths is someone has to be willing to actually put that out and risk that amount. Which given there’s a chance the person at fault might end up in jail? I wouldn’t take that risk.  You also can’t use a few of these items given their overestimated values and would need to reevaluate them before lending unless you as a bank want to be on the hook for the missing differences of pre and post reevaluation. Utterly pointless.
The music is distracting and irritating.
One day later he comes out himself and says he might need to sell some of his properties.  What bank in their right mind would want to loan to this convicted fraudster?  The Palm Beach County tax appraisers value Mar-a-lago at between 18-37 million.
Because he’s innocent, and this is obvious political persecution via weaponization of the government against him (and the people$.  It’s all a sham.
lol whats forbes worth?
Good, then why is he short 360 million?
Even forbes recognized that Mar-a-lago is worth hundreds of millions, not the paltry amount AG James claimed it was worth.
Welllll this didn't age well.
I can't believe most of the commentators have no idea what they are talking about.  Many have no idea how values are arrived and for what purpose. It is whatever their ideology they have is what they believe. Our school system need to focus on math and logic not feel good ideas that the left subscribe to.
FORBES   SANITIZING FASCISTS FOR PROFIT, THE HEALTH OF THE NATION BE DAMNED
Aging like milk!!
I am not an A.I. generated Forbes journalist. Just an average guy... and I can tell you one thing.  He doesn't have the money.   Russia is his only way out. So much for Republicans loving "FREEDOM"
This all ASSUMES that his properties are not already heavily leveraged with debt.
Steve Garvey is perfect for California!
Love Steve Garvey!
Sooooo....where's his bond money? 🫤
This bullshit
Typical Forbes fake news that has zero factual evidence or support for their rampant Right Wing propaganda mission for the wealthy elite. Trickle down economics is only good for those who would not trickle down any of the money they receive. And they can somehow convince economically struggling Republicans that it works.
I don't believe it
VOTE BLUE, ITS FREEDOM FOR ME AND FREEDOM FOR YOU!!🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸 GOD BLESS AMERICA🇺🇸
When they collect his buildings and they will! I hope they use them to house the migrants😂
This is Forbes opinion?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
because:  Saudi Arabia owns him
Curry favor is an incorrectly spelled idiom. It should be "carry favor".  My college language teacher would have given me a zero on that paper, but you are forgiving Kieran.
Ironic if he borrows against Mar-a-lago as assessed at its true value to pay a penalty for "overvaluing it" (as determined arbitrarily by a biased judge)
Forbes got money too. Why do they get to keep my money? All billionaires need to pay REPARATIONS
Won’t have to sell, huh? Well, sane Americans and our justice system will have to fix that. Let’s make him a “thousandaire” ASAP.
This didn't age well...
Forbes just isn’t credible anymore. They are part of the problem.  Lies and exaggerations are the norm there.
Dont give any mercy to him
W ho givs a funk .
Is it actually legal to borrow money    from foreign entities to whom he will then be beholden  should he ever be president again ?
.BS LMAO 🤣😂🤣😂 HE'S GOTTA PAY UP 😊
E. Jean Carrol finally got money after accusing 6 different men of rape over the past 25 years
He didn’t file an appeal. They just wrote a notice to appeal. It’s like one page.
Why don’t we start with FORBES paying us back all the money FORBES had made in America.
Did you notice 4.8k people do not like your work. Your editing is sad
Didn't even take a whole day for this to age like milk. Whoopsie.
His puppets are buying his $400 fake gold shoes. Sad
even forbes is prostrating themselves to carry water for Drumpf.  capitalism makes sane minds perform mental gymnastics to defend their own
No he can’t borrow money, at least not in New York.  And there is no 400 million in cash.  He just tried to offer 100 million in cash, but that ain’t gonna fly with the judge.  He has less than a month to come up with 110% of 464 million before Tish Janes starts selling off his properties
Correction- he wasn’t charged with sexual abuse. He was fined for defamation.
This video is garbage.  Sounds like this information is made up.  There isn't a single source cited.  I would be curious to hear what Suzanne Craig would have to say about this.
But who would loan him money now?
Donald Dump  Can just Borrow the Money from ( Saudi Arabia ) then Declare Bankruptcy ( Again ... for the 5th Time ) O.. my bad .. they just said he couldn’t come up with the Money the Other day... maybe his Election Slush Fund has run low on Cash.....
His SuperPAC could always (illegally) pay it
Really? It looks like $100 million is all he's got. What American bank is going to lend him $$$$? Maybe Russian mobsters? Forbes, you are not definitely what your legacy is...
uh oh, having to borrow money in this Fed environment doesn't sound fun
This is so sad for a great man that loves america. And demorats hate america and americans
He just announced he can’t make a bond. So , you are wrong. What else is new?
The computer voice is noxious.  I can't listen.
😂
this is a puff piece...don't believe a word of it
Forbes WEALTH  ASSESSMENT IS NEVER ACCURATE AND TRUE!
Isnt the whole point of all this that we don't actually know the value of trump's assets because he never reports them accurately? Hence the fraud ruling.
That's what they are really wanting. They want Trumps name off of Wall Street.
If a bank will give him a loan
hey people buy a house slap some paint and then sell next day for double the price how is that not illegal???
Wow you guys are idiots bc he just told the court he only has 100 million he’s going broke
Well this sure turned out to be a bad/deeply wrong take.
Lock him up!!!!
The numbers given here are total bullscheisse. The properties are ‘worth’ such and such amount but no one outside Russia is going to lend him scheisse!
Forbes is biased. End of story
His attorneys just indicate in the filing that he doesn't have enough liquid assets to post the 400+ millions bond. Are you sure about what you are saying about his liquid asset?
He best hurry then.  He claimed today he doesn't have $500M
Let’s just sit back and watch….no matter what, facts prove themselves as they are/were….
He just told the court he doesn't have it. Who is lying?
It took 24 hours for everything in this video to be disproved.  Good job Forbes, nailed it!
He won't have to pay because it's BULLSHIT lol, easily appealed and unconstitutional nonsense.
We're just going to keep getting him where it hurts, and where most take a hint and go away this clown keeps doubling down.
Because it was a nonsensical decision, by an impartial corrupt judge, that will be overturned upon appeal...?
You must be in bed with Putin Forbes! You disgust me! I’m sorry but no Lenders in the US will lend to him. That’s why he started borrowing from Russian Oligarchs! You can’t file bankruptcy on Russian oligarchs! Hence why he is in bed/debt with Putin!  We don’t want the president to curry favor from anyone! Hence the emoluments clause of the Constitution! I know the right wants to get rid of the Constitution and Democracy! Vote 🗳️ 💙to save America and American democracy!
Who says his Mar a largo is worth 300,000000?
How does Forbes know that Trump's properties are mortgage free? stop lying if you do not any evidence.
His Trust will handle it...
Complete BS. All of trump's property are leveraged with loans.  He doesn't have the cash nor will anyone give him a loan against any of his properties which again are leveraged with outstanding loans. Also, NY state will not accept foreign property as collateral.
So why isn’t he paying the bond then???
I think if and when he does pay that fine the state needs to be transparent where that money is going.
We dont care if he sells something or not, the money needs to be secured so he doesnt BS his way of having to pay only 30% and then hide the assets to make it more difficult to seize. All this bragging ? He can shove it
Meanwhile he's trying put up $100m and call it close enough.
Well…. This video didn’t age well less than 24 hours later…😅😂
This didn't age well. He just told the court he can't afford more than $100M. The ludicrus valuation of Mar-a-Lardo at $300M tells us how unrealistic this post is. His only hope is a loan from Musk or a foreign dictator. And the optics there are going to be awful.
I guess forbes didnt read the news today 😂😂😂😂😂
yes ok he got property  but he deflated all of them there for they not worth  as  forbes say  and he is banned from doing  business  in new york  either way he just  admit he only have 100 mil at hand .
Forbes has Fumbled. Massive L
There's a near 0% chance he'll pay anything.. being a victimless crime and a blatant cash grab.. particularly since the bank signed off on the loan AFTER their appraiser agreed with the value.. this will never ever pass a legitimate appeals court that considers all the relevant evidence endogorgon the activist flat out ignored
WRONG.
Not true,
Who is going to lend this grifter money?
QUALITIES are EXCELLENCE.
Let him pay it and stop whining, then we see if you will still brag like this.
russia will fork the bill ?
It's one day later now, and donnie admitted to the judge that HE AIN'T GOT THE MONEY!!!!
Forbes is wrong almost as often as Donald T. is.
He shouldn't have to because HE'S INNOCENT!
😅
Rich & white u get away with anything
If he is so rich, why is he hawking sneakers and bobble heads. It's just another con.
Because of you 🤡 Don Da Con was able to get where he is 😂
You guys are  🤡🤡🤡
Considering he just came out today and admitted he doesn’t have the money to post the bond, and is trying to weasel his way out of the full amount, Tish James will be free to take assets for the people of New York, after his feeble appeal for special treatment is denied. So technically he won’t sell it, it will be taken.
Forbes is so right-leaning now that it's lost a lot of credibility. It's now looked at like those cast of characters at Fox News.
Forbes 🤡🤡🤡
He just said he Don't have the Money 😂😂😂
Sorry but AG James will be seizing his assets!
Remember, there’s no victim, The banks made their own appraisal of his properties, they gave him the loan he paid it off. And they were happy. But here comes New York to say it was overvalued and he scammed the bank, well not according to the bank.
Forbes? I guess y'all didn't get the memo from his attorneys.... Yeah, turns out NONE of those numbers y'all have up there are true, and in fact, he can't come up with more than $100 million in cash. Pity.... So you can take this post down. What a crock of s#it!
He won’t have to pay anything. He’s innocent. Forbes knows it too.
Bull @@#$.  They are going to start selling assets
Wouldn't that be awesome? If he took out a loan against one of his "grossly overvalued" properties to pay this? To shut them up with the same completely legal process that got him here to begin with. It's temporary anyway. This will be overturned when it gets out of the corrupt NY court system.
Don the Con for Prison 2024!🇺🇸
Hahahaha. Forbes!!
He will have to sell a lot of sneakers .
lol... ok
first it was 355, then 454, now its 540?  what's the real number?
Well whaddaya know he doesn't have it and wants to "NEGOTIATE " yeah right
You Blew IT.  HAHAHA
About about Jared sharing some of that  2 BILLION from Saudi Arabia?
fOrBeZ sAiD hE hAs 400 MiL LiQuiD s0 iT mUsT bE tRuE! 🤡
His golfs in Europe are not worth that much, not even half of what you claim... you don't seem to have done any serious homework on your numbers ...
Because he’s gonna sell shoes! And his wife Mercedes is gonna help him. Cause he’s not a loser, not a loser, not a loser…..I think
Listening to estimates from forbes , is like believing FOX news 😂. Nothing but lies .
FAKE NEWS
LOL, he can't pay a thing LOL
Prove it.
He should close down in NY.
I call B. S. You sound intoxicated on Orange koolaid
The left wants to repossess all of his properties and move immigrants into those Towers that's how much they hate him
This is the company that goosed his net worth up their bullshit list for years.
Ha Ha Ha😂 . Sure he does.
Because he will beat it on appeal 😂
Because it’s a bogus trial with no real basis and is going to be overturned.
No; they won't be sold but seized.
Get out of NY
LMAO... Already this has been proven FALSE. Great report Forbes lmao
Forbes? Really? Haven't you lied enough for this traitor? Hey Steve, why don't you shell out the cash to cover the rapists' bill?
he earned those assets during his life. leticia james and the judge engrone are corrupts. they should be investigated and put them jail.
I think this is the single fastest occurrence of milk spoiling and aging. Scientific marvel really, good on you "Forbes Sciences Department "
Well he doesn't have money. This video is a lie.
Egg on your face Forbes.
Wonder how well this video will age?
Because he won’t have to pay a dime. The judgement is the most ludicrous miscarriage of justice in history.
Great pitch let's see if your lenders swing.
Don't pay a dime.
If he pays the money to New York State, when the cases over returned, will New York State have to pay him the interest on the money almost $1 million a day?
Shut up forbes
It’s nothing for him,he’s just don’t want to,he’s billionaire
This video is such a BS!
Forbes seems to have its figurative lips firmly sealed to Trumps wrinkled back side.
WHO'S GONNA LEND THAT CRIMINAL MONEY?
Given today's news, I would say Forbes once again was terribly overestimating the great grifter's liquidity.
Cause his fan-boys will pay it out of their children's college fund. 😆 🤣 😂
so why has he offered new York state only $100 million toward the amount levied by judge engoron.
Either state facts or not, quite trying to,protect the integrity of Forbes Magazine and list the true facts. The magazine has been caught hundreds of times falsifying information to make a story more sensational. Also mention that Trump’s son in law was just given $10 Billion dollars for negotiating a weapons sales agreement as a “quote” “hired intern”, Al illegal act and a non government employee. Post the facts and society may decide they will buy your magazine or even have any faith that you are not simply a tool for the wealthy to promote their newest Ponzi Schemes.
Forbes is right wing propaganda.   Donnie is broke. So are the rest of his cult.  More lies right here.
Yes and he's also 6'3" 230lbs and in perfect health.
Well this did not age well.       lol 😂   He posted a measly 100 million of 550 he owes more than he said he and Alina said they promised he would easily pay cause he’s “ a billionaire “   Where’s Alina 😊
Trump's lawyers just admitted he doesn'yt have the money and will have to sell buildings.
Lie
This aged like milk.
cuz of the RNC slush fund he now owns ? lol
Thats why he said he was broke today right 👍😅😅😅
Liberals will pay a big price for using the court system to try to steal another election! THEY WILL FAIL AT THE BALLOT BOX!
You guys obviously don't know what you're talking about. That's why he sent in more requests today because he does not have the money. Why don't you guys start reporting real stuff? He's broke and those were his words. 😂
He can borrow it from a "foreign entity?!!" Are you serious? As if he wasn't already a" bigly " security risk. Jesus Christ. Even Stevie Wonder can see that a problem for ANY American politician.
Lol i bet he doesnt pay 1 dime lol
I can donate $5.
Who is going to loan him money at this juncture?
He just admitted to the New York Court that he don't have the money
America is one big ponzi 👹 Scheme that’s soon to fall just like Rome
Truth social isn't worth anything
lol. He admitted he doesn’t have the cash. No one in Ny can lend him money. No one else is gonna.
Imagine giving loans based on property collateral to someone who needs the money to appeal the court judgment of fraud in regards to the value of property offered up as collateral.
She is evil to the core
This video content is a big fat contradiction. You don't know what is incumbered in Trump's portfolio.
BWWAHH HAHAH! oh wait your serious, let me laugh even harder...
Why does the amount of money keep growing?
😂😂😂😂
So you're saying he needs to take the paycheck from being President of the world's most nuclear warhead owning country? GOT IT!
Those people are not getting Trump's money. Not a dime.
His fellow prisoners won’t care what his cash is. Did Eric write this?
its sound highly unlikely since his attorneys just said they weren't paying the full amount required by law
Sell properties or borrow against them...he's going to lose them in the end anyway on his way to jail.
Diaper Don has always been a Ponzi scheme.
Crackpot judge values Maro Lago at 18 Million, and Forbes values at $300 million. 🤦🏻‍♂️ There’s no public trust in the leftist ruled judiciary system.
Don't be surprised that Forbes is supportive of Trump's business situations because Trump's major piece of legislation during his presidency was the Tax cut of 2017 which mainly helped the wealthy corporations such as Forbes.
Forbes and Fox news are the confederacy's propaganda media outlet.
You may want to remove this after today's filing that he can't make bond without selling assets and begging to not be forced to do so. Proving again that Forbes knows absolutely nothing.
You soind like AI
Whoever is responsible for producing this video on behalf of Forbes should be fired! He has already come out and said he can't afford it which is why he's trying to appeal without securing a bond 🤷
Forbes has become nothing more than a propaganda and misinformation tool.
He would have paid the bond if he had it…
Well, Trump's lawyers just filed a brief saying he doesn't have the money. So much for your bullshit, Forbes.
They won’t have the chance not too sell off assets if they don’t secure a bond before the stay runs out. Enforcement can take whatever they want and sell it😂😂😂
They are reporting he doesn't have enough money to pay for both judgements. He's begging the court for a reduction.
Oh. A bank that doesn’t do business in New York that can handle half a billion dollars. Lol, that should be easy to find.
appeals court will throw this out , judgements made  by a biased criminal judge never stand
Thank God- do something quickly as Letitia is cackling as daily interest mounts on his (“unjust”) judgements! 🧙🏿‍♀️
Lots of speculation Forbes.   Let’s just let this one play out to see what actually happens.   If he has the money, If he believes he will win the appeal, he will pay. I doubt he’d win the appeal though.
What an odd piece from Forbes.
He's going to win on appeal anyway. These clowns are burying themselves trying to take down The Don
You guys forgot to mention he has yet to post bond for either of his appeals.
Who exactly is he paying, the government? Nobody realizes the moral hazard of allowing the government to walk in, claim fraud in any private business transaction and just take as much as they can from those involved? Its all fun and games while the power is being used against somebody that you don't like, I wonder how fair you think it is when its used against YOU!
So you believe his balance sheet?  Did you keep up on the trial at all?  That’s the whole reason he owes 450 million.  He lied on his balance sheets.  Gawd.
SUE the LYING "mainstream media" for DEFAMATION OF CHARACTOR for $1,000,000,000 each and use $700 Million of it (Always Pay more, just in case they FALSIFY more charges or FALSELY claim he didn't pay enough)
So show us just how rich he is, pay the amount then.
For now.
At what cost?
You have to pay your bills.
He could also liquidize and be 4 billion so total 8 billion realized.
Not journalism but hard hard speculation 😂
...Ha Ha Ha.......
The time will tell 🤡
Truth social has been loosing money since its inception.
So why isn’t he putting up the money
Yes we are a unjust banna republic.
For a supposed source of financial information, this is some of the most misleading, ill-informed commentary available. WTG Forbes.
Whats taking him so long?
This comment didn't age well! He doesn't have the money! Lmao!
Forbes sucks. Why you Lieing for the fraudster. Bet you wouldn't buy mar a Lago for 100 much less 300
Forbes has lost it
Pay your bills!
Then why does he need the donations to his campaign to pay for his legal fees?? This is paid bullshit!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 why hasn’t he done anything tho!???🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
He may be able to come up with the money, but pissing away half a billion dollars ain't the sign of a good businessman.  In trump's mind, being in debt and filing for bankruptcy / stiffing people this is his recipe for success.
Well he just admitted today he can only pay $100M in a court filing. Also, i don't think this article stressed enough he can't borrow money from any bank that does business in NY, the financial capital of the world. What third-rate bank would lend someone with Trump's reputation for not paying his bills $400M+?
All obtained with tainted monies!
MAGA people going to pay.
Latisha is so un lawyer and should be disbarred
Hahahahahahaha…..Forbes, the new FOX propaganda entertainment channel #GFY 😅
FORBES IS FAKE NEWS. MAR A LAGO IS EASILY WORTH OVER A BILLION.
They took duffus donald off their list....he has no money....no bank would give him money unless he sells something...watch and learn clowns
Nobody knows what he has
Never listen to this site ever again he just admitted that he was broke😂😂😂😂
I'm tired of biased media
Criminal
Why would anyone believe what you say? You actually know nothing for sure,and act like you do.  His New York dealings aren’t even run by him anymore,not until the bills are paid.
The judge gets to decide what trumps property is worth now and apparently Forbes does too.
Really? Lol. What Forbes eastimates is true? Lol What about his already outstanding debt? He is running pretty close to the line. If he had it, why didn't he put up the cash when filing the  appeal?  Seeing him squirm  at every turn is hilarious and so satisfying. We will see.
I don’t care how he pays, I just wanna see justice done and I want to see that man made accountable for his criminality.
He has the money why would he let the interest hit him every day?
Sell them, you mean forfeit 😊
I call B.S. on this Article
Who says he got that? He probably got his property mortgage to highest.Don’t believe his lies
Don't believe anything Forbes says
Well, this video didn't age well: $100M is a bit less than $454M
He hasn't paid the $83M plus to appeal and he won't win an appeal there. Why? How old is that phony net worth estimate and was the guy just convicted, again, for frwud involved? Maralago is appraised at $127M, not $300M and aside from possible encumbrance of debt it could be siezed. So eho exactly is going to loan him money? Go soak your head Forbes. BTW i prefer democracy.
This entire video is just.....wrong, he has nothing and will lose his assets. Letitia James' new office WILL be in 40 Walstreet.
🙄
Forbes, another MAGA influenced propaganda outlet. We will soon see if he actually has the money.
Shooooot, I was thinking he was going to use campaign funding to pay court debts like any regular crooked politician.
Well that was wrong
😂😂😂 I doubt your reporting 😂😂😂
So now I know Forbes is pushing clickbait alternative facts like faux news.
Forbes plays both sides and its gross, thats why I never fully trust or subscribe to this BS
this is cruel and unusual punishment
His filing yesterday says he will have to sell properties since doesn’t have the cash…🤔
Putin will help.
Why would anyone pay ransom?....
Where is Melania?
Shitty New York 😂
We’re waiting to see how much he posts for the bond before the NYAC starts seizing his assets. This should be interesting. Forbes saying he has the money doesn’t mean he actually does.
Orly? Cuz he just said he cant pay
Hahahaha. Right😂
If what you say is true about Donald Trump's finances why doesn't he just put up the bond money something may come up in the appeal that may turn things around for him. I seriously doubt it but New York would have to pay him the money back this is what I am hearing, thank you for your reporting
They're definitely going to get drumpf now. Almost 10 years of lies and finally you him.
This is such bullshit. If he has it, he could put up the cash bond.
It’s outrageous that this judgement was made. Kathy Hochul even said he’s being fined this much because of who he is. Never go full authoritarian, democrats!
Mar-a-lago isn't worth $300 million because it can't be changed.
This is gonna trigger the lefties 😂😂
#just do it* Should've could've would've This should be easy peasy right, For a multi millionaire with millions in cash on hand so he says at his rallies and in his tweets / truths 😂
Has our vote!
He probably does not own them. Most likley nobody will loan him. You guys are off.
Forbes is on full cope mode.
Funny because he tried posting 100$ million only a while ago. This video is a sack of bs
The question is, what if the judgement will be overturned on appeal, would the state then be responsible for moneys paid+ damages+ legal fees?
His properties aren’t mortgage free. If he has the money why isn’t he putting up the bond. The clock is ticking, interest is piling up.
Bottom line? Maybe  Forbes will give or lend CON THE TRAITOROUS  THE MONEY
Who's loaning it to him?
We think mortgage free!
Fine, but he'll end up losing some real estate in the long run when he defaults on the loans. Just kicking the can down the road.
This isnt the issue, He's not guilty of anything. He shouldn't pay a dime. He'll win the appeal and hopefully file a law case against Willis for wrongfull prosecution.
Rigoddamndiculous.
Wrong...he can't borrow as no lenders in NY or registered in NY can lend to him and he has that pesky monitor to deal with. If he borrows from the Saudi"s he will be in real trouble politically as well as not being able to take money from his buddy Putin. That would be treasonous. He doesn't have the money, they will start seizing assets soon.
What has happened to Forbes?😮
He needs to sell Tacos 🌮 now beside sneakers 👟!!!  The Dude 🦧 is totally BROKE. 😉
Yeah, he's going to sell them beautiful sneakers to cover it 🤦😵🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He did not file an appeal, which would require posting a bond. He filed notice that he would appeal. If you can't get that straight then your whole report is probably suspect.
They will never charge him, oops. He will never be found guilty, oops. He won't have to pay a fine, oops. Maga wrong every step of the way.
Nothing compared to what NYC will have to pay him after all is said and done.
FORBES: So why don't you put up traitor Trump's surity bond? As a gesture of good faith perhaps?
Well  if Forbes thinks he is such a good risk, they should secure his bond.
They can't break the best President we ever had!!!
Did he write this for Forbes, they believed his self reporting, before?
If Cult 45 has that kind of money, then give it up, Donny Boy. Oh, I forgot. He doesn't like to pay his bills.
BULLLLLLLLLLLSHIT.  FORBES IS ABOUT AS DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY AS THE FORMERLY NON-FASCIST NEW YORK TIMES. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wait, what? Mar-a-lago is worth some $300 plus millions? I thought Donny said it’s worth a billion plus? Hmmmm, he is therefore guilty of ALL charges.
Because he’s never going to pay a dime from this BS show trial.
I. Really don’t make A Habit of Reading Forbes, but when I do it reminds me it is just an offshoot of Fox !!!
Because the Saudis or Emiratis or Russians or anyone else he sold United States intelligence too can easily come up with it?  Oh I’m sorry, I thought we were actually talking about facts.
Well, SOMEBODY has to make all that happen - get the loan, file papers, beat the deadline. Alina Habba, AKA Whoopsi Goldbrick? Her track record is pretty dismal. (But a convincing Ivanka equivalent.)
HAHAHAHA UPDATE THIS FALSE STORY 😂
He wont' have to sell any building only while he is appealing. But once he fails the appeal, which will only be an appeal on the amount of the penalty not the liability, he will then have to pay cash of around 1/2 a billion dollars with all the interest accrued. Even if he were to win the appeal it would only lessen the amount owed to NYC and he would still have to sell some assets to cover the loan he took out during the appeal.
BULL
If any of those building are in New York the state will seize them anyway.
He has not paid any bond because doesn't have ANY money in the bank ,IT WAS ALL A LIE !!  it has just been established !! Leticia can now start selling his real estate !! SO STOP LYING !😮😮
DOJ has lost its mind. Where’s the so called fraud you speak of? People can’t seem to look past their manufactured hatred for the orange man… then completely look over all the blatant illegal things politicians on both sides do everyday…
OK........  tell you what, let's check back in in 30 days.
I didn't know Forbes was an extreme right wing media outlet, well, now I know.
Please he just missed the deadline for the 88 million.
Yeah Right
We need to literally just take his money. I mean he was convicted on all charges. He’s guilty and racist. Let’s just take his money it should be easy. Or we need to change laws to where we can just take it it’s the right thing to do.!  Free Palestine !  🏳️‍⚧️🇵🇸🏳️‍🌈🇺🇦✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽
He does not need to sell anything..You can borrow against them and if the assests are fully paid off then you would even get a rate lower than the stock market gives for its savings programs...Thus he would actually profit from loaning out versus selling.......He can pay the loans off with an asset valuation that will pay more in interest from the stock market than the interest he will owe..Sorry Dems you lose again..
Mar A Lago is NOT worth 300 Million! It can never be anything but what it is right now! It has restrictions on it! You can't remodel it or tear it down and build something else! It has to stay like it is and always be a private club! If those things did not exist, then it would have crazy value!
Putin will loan whatever he needs
Forbes has been so far up Trump's bung they haven't seen light for half a century.
You didn't include any outstanding loans and other debt. The math isn't mathing.
Something else was going on that we don't know. The trial didn't prove anything. Were these legitimate loans on the properties? If I go to the bank and get a commercial loan, they hold the responsibility of verifying the value of the asset in the current market conditions.
Well lying Dems then should Forbes be arrested for overstating wealth??? No one loses money or is hurt by Forbes either and Forbes has put down in writing publicly their estimates!!
I don’t believe anything you said.
Two totally unjustified lawsuits. E Carol is pathetic and this real estate is BS😊
Wrong. Looks like He doesn't have the fine $$$$$
You're high.
He shouldn’t have to come with a dime, this freaking judge and black woman should be thrown in jail.
😂😂😂😂😂😂......HE STILL HAS TO PAY....HE HAS TO PUT A BOND IN ORDER TO APEAL....LMFAOOO...UP YOURS MAGA😂😂😂😂
Bullshit
... Then why hasn't he posted the bond?  Why is he using PAC to post his legal fees?  Why is he trying to take over the RNC to pay his bills?  If he had the money he would have posted the bond.... Why can't you admit that he's and to file bankruptcy?  Clearly he didn't have the flexibility you say he does.. Cause he's about to go to collections.  The Saudis and russians ain't going to save him... Why can't you see that?
They should get rid of him he already said he's not paying nothing to any one
AP reported the vast majority of Trump’s properties are already mortgaged to their near-value. I’d like to see where Forbes is sourcing this ‘mortgage-free’ portfolio.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Hide & watch!
He won't have to sell because his assets will be seized.
Forbes has been inaccurately displaying the "news" about Chump for years. So their far fetched pandering scenarios aren't deeply thought out.
Either way Lock Him Up.
I call BULLSHIT.
LIES, LIES, LIES!!
Orange traitor is about to lose half a billion dollars. That's just to start with. He'll be fitted for an orange jumpsuit next.
They didn’t appeal anything yesterday
Its all has debt on it it he s like Madoff one step ahead of the collapse praying for a refund to help his problems hes like broken
You Lie!  First he didn’t appeal he has to put up the money to appeal. He filed an intent to appeal. 2nd forbes has overvalued his properties. Get your ish straight!
Very Good!... #1999 ✝ {2-27-2024)
His stake in Truth Social alone is valued at $4,000,000,000; honestly, I am not losing any sleep over his net worth.
TDS is a cult symptom at this point. Lol no way prosecuting a political opponent at all costs is American... this has to be funded by China, right? Destroying their competition from within? Demoralization and fomenting inner fighting?
Sue The government for persecution
But why would we want a president who has crushing debt to foreign entities? That easily writes the playbook for bias in foreign interest “against” the better interest and priority of the American public. He’s a cancer anyway you cut it.
Mar-a-lago = $300,000,000?????  Not according to the tax assessment which put's it at 30.6 million. Forbes is not a source for accurate information, based on this video.
He shouldn't have to do any of that bogus charges evil evil people demons......
Who gets the money?
He will be cleared and will become the president which he never did lose.
If he chose to give the NY building up it wouldn't kill him. He will probably sell or give all NY properties anyway after this. He's 77 he has more money than he could spend in his life span. He is not quitting, dems are fools and commies to think he would.
Yeah, but he wont pay it. You do not understand the mind a narcissist.
Bullcrap! Lumpy drawers has very little liquidity. Forbes has become another propaganda rag. Too bad. Ol Malcolm is rolling in his grave.
This video says more about Forbes bs then Trumps bs
So why isn’t he boasting anymore? Is he being humble? Psshh..come on fishin Forbes this is hullabaloo.
If anyone will give him a loan
That's funny, he has offered to put only 100 million🤣
Hilarious estimates by Forbes, as we now know those estimates are waaaay off.
Mar-a-largo worth closer to a billion lol. 3 acre empty plots near there for sale for 250 million.
*DON'T DO BUSINESS IN A WOKE STATE* The Message is clear - All Businesses or persons who are *NOT* a Democratic Socialist and don't think our US nations need to be *FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED* as China Joe Promised will be targeted, abused without due process and criminally charged with a bogus charge to ruin them for not assimilating to the New World Order. Re-Elect a DEM or Uni-Party RINO and they will just Double Down, this time on you, your Company, your friends, family, and associates even if they don't know you.
Mara Lardo word: 300 million hahah aka the entire video is wrong
Thank you Kyle
Forbes reporting... that's laughable!!😂😂😂
Do it n quit crying, Donnie. You owe usa money.😅😅😅😅
Anything Forbes claims holds no validity.  Everything Forbes has claimed seems to be biased on Trump's behalf.
She is going jail big time!!
Mar a lago is not 300 million. You can check the assessor office for that.
3.5K Dislikes tells all - Forbes next to go WOKE BROKE
Thats if he can find a bank to do business with, last i heard no bank in NY will have anything to do with him, thats qhy he started doing business with Russia.
Maralago is not worth 300 million! It’s 18 million. Is this video made based on trumps statements?  You know the ones he was just convicted of fraud for? Most of these numbers are so insane! Do you really think this will help? Most people can read public court filings you know. 😂
I would love to know where the 540 million is going being there is no victim nor defendant in the case the bank didn't even press charges...
yeah right.. we’ll have to see about that, eh?
Y'all wild if you think he has that much somewhere in cash. dude is slinging sneakers and perfume for christ sake.
Neither bonding companies nor the government of New York will accept the actual properties as collateral. He will have to either mortgage or sell some assets to raise the money for any appellate bond. And since he filed his appeal of the $350M judgment without posting a bond, New York could seize any of his New York properties or their cash even while the appeal goes forward.
So the bottom line he does not have the funds😊
because if we ALL pitched in 10 BUCKS.......
Nice to be rich.  It doesn't concern me remember its not me
Wait what? Mar-a-Lago worth 300M? Letitia said it was worth 18M. LMAO.
You can say how much you think your property is and its the bank will assess its based on their appraisal. Now the bank said this is how much they can lend you and you paid it back end of story. These is a politically motivated case plain and simple lets not complicate it.
That's why's he's letting interest pile up in the mean time and spending more on attorneys to ask for stays he  is not entitled to.
Well now he’s TRYING to appeal with a fraction of the amount he owes. What’s your explanation for that?! 😂😂😂
His “Balance Sheet”. Who trusts his “balance sheet”?
Nobody is going to loan him money.
Forbes is officially the infowars of business magazines.
This is a garbage Psy-Op video. If any of his properties was worth anything close to what the vid reported, he would never have gone to court in first place. Starting with his properties being fraudulently overpriced and then downpriced. That’s why he’s in court for IRS Fraud.
He's not gonna have to pay any of it anyways.
Total nonsense! Forbes overestimates these properties and underestimates Trump's credit options in this clip. Yes dude can borrow money on these properties, but not for the values started and not from any NY banks, which means most of them. He also will have to pay interest and principal payments to service those loans, if he can get them, and interest rates will obviously not be favorable to somebody who can only borrow from a limited number of credit options. He also cannot overstate the values given to creditors and most likely also needs approval from court appointed monitor to accept a loan.
One of the stupidest fact-free videos on YT. This video does not even answer its own question!
James is insane and lawless!!
That is awesome!!!!
I wouldnt pay those crimanls a godamn thing
This is BS
FORBES IS RIGHT
...MORE STUPID LIES FROM forbes.
Forbes is an AI ,POS platform.
Forbes has become as consistent and solid as a poo after a week of Jager bombs and taco bell😂
The judicial system has become a circus.
Really he should be in prison for his coup attempt. Prosecution on a series of lesser charges looks political and doesn't address the problem. Where is the FBI CI investigation? Rosenstein blocked it, and Garland has failed to initiate one.
he is about to lose more. no one going to help him.
He cannot use the media ither.
How much is The Big Crackpot raking in from selling (or exposing) his hoard of classified documents? Is he reporting this income on his taxes? Why does Forbes never report on this?
Lemme guess, trump’s publicist, John Miller, gave you guys the lowdown on his  liquidity?? 👀😆
Lies he's going to have to sell some assets to pay what he owes
FORBES EITHER YOU GUYS ARE CLICK BAITING WITH THIS VIDEO OR YOU HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE FRAUD HIM SELF BECAUSE THAT IS NO WHERE NEAR!!! TRUMPS NET WORTH! AND THIS INFORMATION IS  PURE FICTION!! AND HONESTLY I  THINK YOU ALL KNOW THAT! YOUR JUST CHOOSING TO CLICK BAIT!
He can not use the Scotland one. LOL There legal problems there. so how much more is there that not clear and he knows it.
Mortgage free does not mean 100% ownership, what is the Russian percentage!
Mar-A-Lago is only worth $27M.
Hello Forbes why is he selling the $19 shoes for $400?
Citizen Trumpf does not own all the buildings. LOL First he has to find the someone to back him. He will not give his cash then he be broke..
taking a mortgage out to save his buildings is lovely enough. Seeing the state seize it would be the cherry on the top. If we can believe his balance sheet. he is a crook like nixon and a liar.
I thought when a federal investigation is open everything is open to the investigation.
Overvaluing properties seems to be very popular at the moment. Mar a largo $300m? Hahahaha! Incidentally, you might want to speak to Donald, he thinks it’s worth $650m.
Yeah should be interesting for him to get a loan after the bank's all found out that he's been lying about his finances for decades.
Forbes relies on Trump's own estimations for their valuations. We all know how accurate Trump's estimations are........ #facepalm
Trump4ever!
Mar-A-Lago is worth 300 million even though it is a historic site and can never be developed? I highly doubt that. People buy these kinds of properties to develop them.
Yeah even if the valuations were accurate in this video, the clock is ticking. He’s not going to be able to borrow enough money against his properties in the time remaining.
That's a crock of Bs*** and you know it.
He doesn't owe anything. The penalties are Unconstitutional!
Why ??? Becaise they HAVE NO CASE !
Mortgage free properties?...maybe so. Oh and FYI he lost that appeal for more time...the clock is ticking, so pay up money bags to file the appeal, I suspect Wind bag will be the result. We shall soon see within days.
Keep scrolling if you want a good laugh, triggered lefties 😂😂😂
Sorry but there is 0 chance he has 400B liquid. 0 chance. And as for the loan, who tf would be dumb enough to loan him anything?
He is a corrupt person……
When did you list liquid assets? Also, if he doesn't put up a bond, he'll have zero say over what properties are seized.
I would be shocked if that politically driven keystone cops ruling wasn't overturned. Even the random financial penalty was ridiculous.
Maybe he'll pay it with the proceeds from his sneaker sales 😂😂😂
Or just borrow the $ from Elon Musk. He’s not afraid to support what he believes in.
What entity will loan MF45 over $500M cash?
Dems devastated.
Are you the fools who said is 10,000 sq.ft. condo was 30,000 sq.ft.?
Just to be safe he should use his property tax valuation as the value of the properties. We know those values are never overstated LOL. Then the C
Looking forward to the third EJC defamation lawsuit against MF45.  Hopefully Ruby and Shay, GA election workers, file a lawsuit too. Members of congress suing Capitol police suing Keep suing him until he is a "Negative Billionaire"
Mr. Putin if you are listening, I need 500 Million. You can have Ukraine and anything else you want.
The democrats hate him because they’re terrified of him! That’s why they’re trying to stop him from becoming president!
Lies
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Probably because its all going to get shut down on appeal.
No one will lend to him anymore, so....and does he have money?
Here's why he won't have to pay anything at all...because it's BS
He can not borrow the monies from the banks because he did not report the earning correctly who would lend him the monies.  Beside the lawsuit too big in amount who dare to lend him monies
Yeah, but who is going to loan him any money? He could get it for free though, from idiots like Elon Musk.
If Mar-a-Lago is estimated at $300million, why is he being charged for fraud? Disbar Willis Now!
you're forgetting a lot, like the 4 billion his truth social is now worth.
So much COPE in this comment section. 😆
Putin could cover Trump's debts with what he scraps of his shoes.
Tish wants the walstreet building she already said
Because his supporters will GoFundMe out of his debts. No need to watch this video.
He didn't appeal anything yet, he made a notice of intent to appeal, he hasn't paid the required bond or put up the cash to make the appeal.
And Volcker he also wanted to earn the same thing
Why? Because the idiot AG will lose upon appeal.
He can't borrow from a bank registered in NY State, which is every bank in the West.
Putin got himself in a bad spot as well, so I don't think his friendly foreign billionaire is going to be helpful either.
In Forbes's dreams.
Is it same earning with the Reagan when he ran the country
Why is he constantly asking his followers for $$? I’d feel taken.
I love it Forbes screwed up. Follow me here. They say he's worth 2.6B, but then state that UNMORTGAGED properties are 1.1B. BOOM...net worth immediately down to 1.5B. This means that in order to come up with 550m, and NOT use his 400m cash, he will need to mortgage HALF of all remaining properties. This 550m, will add to the 1.5B in debt he already has. His debt would now be 2.5B, against 550m plus 400m in liquid assets. Six percent of two billion dollars is 120m dollars a year, in INTEREST, and he has 400m in cash. He still has to fund his operations. He simply cannot take on the additional debt load..as he is ALREADY cash poor. I believe that the real cash he has is under 100m, and his REAL debt is closer to 3b, and the REAL value of his properties is under 2b. His NET WORTH....debt minus value plus cash, is well under a billion dollars, and dropping fast..dropping by a hundred million a year.
A lot of people here are gonna be really upset come Nov. 😂 Scream at the sky, I hear that helps.
Recently paid off with all the money he stole as president! he will get caught soon on that end as well!
The same reason same reason he can get away with breaking laws.
Don't forget he has a lot of morons who send this "billionaire" money to pay for his crimes. If the info here is true, then he needs to pay up! No excuses.
I see him taking it out of the kid's inheirtance.
Because he doesnt own them
Won''t he have to put some in escrow if he does not have the cash? Isn't some of the cash he has committed to other things?  BY THE WAY THE STATE OF NY WILL WORK WITH ACTUAL VALUE, NOT HIS CLAIMED VALUE😋🤣.
So why hasnt he put up the cash or bond yet?
If it's that easy, why hasn't he paid already, instead of risking a seizure?
Trump's not going to have to pay those liers anything in the end, he's going to win in the u.s. supreme court
Miran para ke kieren ser presidente para sease uno presidente para destruilo
Hey you  don't  know what you are talking about.
Then why hasn’t he done it?
Draining the swamp could be very expensive. He needs to start a donation fund for this .
Donkeys are flying and maybe the Mexicans will help him out and pay.
Yea... sure
I suggest waking up at Forbes! Lock him up, lock him up!
He can't even post the appeal bond.
You can spin it however you want. He is a criminal and always has been. There is no denying it. Forbes or Fox you know the Communist news.
A foreign entity loaning money?  You don’t see any conflicts of interest or National Security issues?
Watch our Forbes don’t be throwing those numbers around. You might get hit with a rogue prosecution
Ooops. Guess Forbes missed that one :-))
This is definitely gonna trigger the whiny lefties 😂😂
Bad reporting, Forbes. Trump's lawyers filed a notice of appeal but without a bond, which is toothless. You're supposed to put up a bond matching the judgement if you want to appeal, and he did not.  Also - you said he could borrow money against his mortgage-free properties, but the NYC judgement said he can't borrow from any financial institutions registered in NYC, which eliminates all the standard banks. He will have to go to a place like Saudi, China or Russia to get his money, and those three are not exactly friends of the US. He's in a pickle.
And Putin could loan him the money.
He says he has 400M in cash.  He would never, ever lie.
You hurd it folks.  The rich are above the law.   Maybe its time the people change that
So what's the hold up? Pay!
Or he could just not pay it at all, when his lawyers appeal these ridiculously political judgements.
😂😂😂😂
No one is going to loan him the money. He’s lied so much about his wealth and him not paying his bill . No one going to risk it . Plus if found guilty in his felonies he not going to be the kind of person you want to be associated with.
This is all based on the presumption that the buildings are actually free of obligations.  It's quite likely some of these buildings are mortgaged to the hilt. Mortgage beyond their actual value. So if he's forced to sell one, then the debt will have to be covered by other properties.  We could be looking at the start of the dominoes falling.  I also expect that he will not be able to claim low value for federal taxes and high value for loans anymore.
I call baloney! Absolute hogwash!
Seems like he basically got the Chicago property free. They sued for him not paying loan back and he countersued for loan sharking and paid crumbs
Because it will be overturned, period!!!!
Ha who would trust forbes these days
so you're saying we didn't sue him hard enough. Welp at least he's half a billion lighter.
My man 🎉🎉2024 let's go Brandon 😂😊
This post is such contrived bullshite!! If he had the cash he would have thrown it down for his appeal.  He's begging for a stay and lower bonds.  His false narrative of being a billionaire are about to be exposed.  The losses just keep rolling in.  F**k, yeah!!!
This may be the most BS piece of reporting ive ever seen. If hes selling or taking on debt to settle the bill. hes doing something he didnt want to do.
Nobody is going to bail out the orange. man after what he is done
Forbes you know he is innocent.
now im seeing why college professors say not to use forbes as a source, stuff like this makes me facepalm on what they are saying.
Well if he has the money, pay the bill!!!!!! It's simple. Thanks for explaining that he's just refusing to pay.
He should have to sell mar-a-lago. He already lives there illegally.
Won’t stop him from taking money from his followers. Another fleecing season begins🐑
He can't sell properties and buildings owned by his Russian handlers.
All those millions is not going to hurt!!! He is not stupid, he has a lot of assets
No Crime iZ Y!   Tyrants and criminals control NYC, the Country and the Whirld.  All criminals, all need years of prison time…
He's cash broke.
How can you sell anything that's not your.
This absolutely INCORRECT. No lending institution will lend on assets potentially seizable by the government. LI base their loan risks against two things; the lendees ability to repay and the value of the asset for resale if repossessed, which in Trump’s properties case is zero - since it will be a government asset for disbursement.  Clearly this channel is propaganda, telling MAGA lies that leads them to violence when things don’t happen the way they expect.
Yeah dont believe it. Why in the world would anyone loan he money??
Really?  Then why hasn’t he put up the bond?
he'll probably just sell some national security secrets to cover it.
Bullshit!  Why wouldn't he have paid already!  112K in interest day!
How long before Biden reinstitutes the draft? Remember, never attack the country that has been giving the Biden Crime Family Burisma Oil kickbacks.
❤
he clearly lied about his liquid assets.  I bet they disappeared from pre-paying his lawyers and the cost of his wife not leaving him.
Mara Lago is only 11 million Forbes is lying orange man bad
Nope. He will never use his money, thats what he has maga give him. If he does pay, it's because putin is likely to lend him the money. Putin owns him and the red party. It makes sense.
BS
Forbes is garbage news
I call B S and I believe he is a traitor
Why borrow money and pay interest, borrowers fees, and create a new bill rather than just paying off a bond if he has the cash to do so? The looming issues of these huge judgments are distraction and need to be put out of the zeitgeist so he can focus on winning. If he would have closed the issue of E Jean Carroll last year, we wouldn't be talking about an $83 million dollar award to her right now.
Because he's innocent it's nothing but a witch hunt and it's all bullshit
Let us know who will back him .  Wait right here
Well I would recommend that NY, backed by the US Justice Dept. agree to waive these penalties if they are successful in putting him in jail - minimum 10 years.  Anything to keep him from ever becoming POTUS again.
Still wonder how you can be accused of something that you didnt do then get a defamation case against you and you have to pay someone for a false accusation because you said something .. isnt being falsely  accused is defamation  in its self?
So he has to pay new york but cant borrow from new york banks? It's extortion.
Because the insane judgement is going to be vacated.
You think Deutsche bank will loan him the money?😂
This doesn't sound accurate.
This is ridiculous! US is becoming like COMMUNIST country can just take away people money!
I wouldn’t barrow him a dime, ask his lawyers if they have received full payments, ask Guiliani?
2.6 that is totally false he's worth way more than that try about 50 billion dollars you have to take into account how many merchandise he has sold in his name worldwide in different countries he made companies overseas he has hotels all the way around the world 2.6 is a joke to a man like that
More fake news to push the narrative.
lmao he's gonna use the Monopoly strategy he never would've come into power if the dems had listened to Henry George like a hundred years ago
What do guys actually know?
He should let NYC seize his buildings as NYC would then be on the hook for maintenance and operating costs. That $355 million windfall for NYC would dry up real fast as they are already struggling with illegals.
This is a good piece..
Lol. Sure. Liars.
AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE PRESIDENCY....!!!!!!!!!
who gets the money?
He’s already trying to weasel out of putting the money up for his appeal.  Let’s see what happens.  I believe nothing from Forbes.  So many of these media companies have sold their souls to the right wingers, and it shows.
lots of misleading going on here.
laughable, virtually every major bank in the world is "registered" in new york, good luck getting a loan donnie.
Probably has his name on the buildings and no ownership
Here is the point.... it will all go away when he wins the Presidency.  Then NY will receive a very slow ( glacier speed) federal government assistance for his tenure... that should be fun for eight years.
All that is great (if your valuations are correct, we know how that’s worked out in the past), but who is going to lend him the money is the real question.
He won't have to sell anything because he will win his appeals case.
So why didn't the 🤡  put up the bond 💰 🤑 💸 when he filed the appeal 🤔
For a guy that is supposedly rich and is a Billionaire??? Wouldn't it make sense to pay the bond and stifle the insanely  daily interest????? One would think that a savvy business person would put a stop to hemorrhaging and burning revenue and profits????
Sounds like bullshit to me
If he really has $540 million, he would pay it already to avoid further interest. But he doesn't. He's rich, but not that rich.
Kyle Mullen sounds like a fan, not a reporter
What we want to know is how a man innocent of all charges, needs to pay "anyone" $540 million dollars!... I'm sorry I forgot the Communists took over a long time ago! 🤣😭🤣
Maron🤌🏻
Then why hasn't posted the money
He should DEMO anything in New York! "We're Renovating all our buildings. GET OUT!"
You mean Penny pinching Jared Kushners 2 Billion Dollars is all gone 👀❓.... 🫢
One problem is he investors invest their money. Nobody has that kind of money sitting around.
He needs liquidity!  Who is going to lend to him, except Russia and Saudi Arabia??
To sell any assets, 45 would have to go through the court. This means, any transaction would have to be above board. Something totally foreign to 45.  It doesn’t look like any lenders are beating down his door, or he’d have already posted the bond.
🤣
Imagine a judge just telling you how much your property is worth and charging you with fraud😂
Yea.... this does not sound credible at all
BS. He doesn't have it thus far and Ms. James CAN seize his assets if he doesn't put up bond-it's the law.
not only is this a lie, it's a stupid one
Ok, we'll see. Dollars to Donuts this reporting is wrong. He'll more than likely be unable to pay without losing assets. What's even more likely is that he'll have a meltdown as all of this takes place (along with all of the legal pressures). 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
They haven’t appealed yet.  They need to have the down payment to actually Appeal
Dude is loaded.
All he has to do is sell another million gold B-Ball shoes and he will have $ to spare.
Forbes SUCKS
lol yeah this seems legit that’s why he’s not freaking out about these judgements (sarcasm)
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ok. Why if he has the money hasn't yet paid the bond?  He needs to put up or shut up.
Of course he can write the check and borrow some more against his properties. How is he going to pay the mortgage on the rest of his properties ? It seems to me if he does that he will have to borrow again next month just to pay his mortgage, no?
Why does this narrator think any of the information about Trump's properties or liquidity is accurate?  We have to assume the only people who know the closest thing to the truth is monitor assigned to track his accounts by the courts.  You know if he says he has $400M, that he actually has about $4M.  And bet all of his properties have mortgages on the minority portions he owns.  His Truth Social SPAC thing is already busted and facing criminal investigation.  Nothing this toad says is accurate.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The crooked judge and Leticia James are the ones that are crooks trying to steal president Trump's money and businesses and ruin his family!!!
I’m sure banks are lining up to loan him money. Maybe Jared can give him some of that $2B in Saudi money.
alot of bullshit is what I heard on this video Anyone that has that much money does not do a "gofundme" nor do they try to sell non existing tack golden tennis shoes for 399 a piece!
He wont have to come up with the money because he didnt do anything wrong. Democrats... Am i right? 😂
😊
This is hilarious.  The narrator sounds embarrassed while he is forced to read this script lol
No . He will win and judgment will be reversed.
Forbes has been known to be reckless with reporting "factual" information. How's y'all cover stars doing in prison for fraud?!!!
❤So why is he making such strenuous efforts to avoid posting bond?  What’s the problem?  Engoran will laugh him out of court
He wont pay because he will win the appeal. When you ask for property loans from a bank, they send out accessors to value the property. If the bank loaned him more than it was worth that's on them. Besides that he has already paid it back a long time ago.
Keep believing what he put on his paperwork.  NY already told you these numbers were fraudulent. If he has it, why doesn't he just pay it?
How much does he pay if the judgement is appealed?
I say he ignores the rulings and picks a bigger fight
Or he could get a wire transfer from Phutin. It would basically be a wraparound. He would be MORE indebted to Phutin, but if he wins, he will stop sending support to Ukraine, essentially handing over Ukraine to Russia. Furthermore, he would do Phutin a real solid by pulling the U.S. out of NATO and allow him to restart U.S.S.R 2nd Edition.... Watch and learn.😊
In case you don't know, Forbes is a propaganda, radical , Vladimir Putin paid for outlet....you cannot believe anything they put out as accurate or factual
That's correct!!! He won't have to sell buildings because hawking gold sneakers and more trading cards will cover it...
WHY would you steal if you are so rich?
Get The money from Putin, just sell your sole. Or your toupee.
LET his buddies pay. " I don't care, do you? This is nothing new.
The clock is still ticking 🕛
But yet he hasn't posted it.... once again Forbes is clueless as to the reality of the situation.
He has no cash to pay the $450 million fine 😅
This is embarrassing for Forbes.    Someone authorized this?
Mortgage free??  Prove it
Click-bait. I stopped reading Forbes a decade ago!
Let's say Forbes is correct and Don the Con has plenty money to pay the fine without selling anything. If that's the case, then Don the Con must be real stupid for not paying or posting the bond, and thus allowing for the possibility of his property being taken by the State of New York...!!!..Forbes report makes no sense.
Ok. WHERE IS HIS MONEY HIDING???
Wouldn’t it be based if Elon covered the fines for him? Heads would explode! 🤯
And who is going to give him those loans? Putin? No sound bank would. And what would the vig be on those loans.
this is some really good science fiction
No one would cover a bond for him
Could, would, should, so why hasn’t he?
Then why don’t he pay it because Forbes is a trumper News
Shall we talk about the wisdom of having a president who has to sell off property or be beholding to a person or foreign power for money to pay off legal judgments?
And who, exactly, is supposed to lend him money?
You never really know what anybody has its easy to hide
So even after a trial showing the fact that Dump over exaggerates his wealth by galactic proportions. Forbes uses Dumps made up BS numbers!!! In the trial they pointed out - in one of the loans he got, cash he said that he had (around 90mil) he didn't have control of. He couldn't use it!!!  so It's very, very, extremely unlikely Dump has 550mil for bond monies for both cases.
Red Don the wannabe dictator.
Most of this is junk info
STEVE FORBES is king of the Incel Army.
Political prosecution, nothing else
Sorry to hear that.
Yea but the question is what bank is going to loan him money knowing he got found guilty of fraud??
XEVEN IF HE PAYS 540000000 THEY WILL NOT BE. SATISFIED. JUST LIKE PAYING A RANSOM S THE WANT IT ALL
I don't believe any of this report.  What's he owe Russia and China as well as all the money he owes in legal fees.
If that were true, he would have done so already. Having a valuable property is meaningless if it is encumbered.
Then why has he not hosted bail yet? As it is, he won't have to sell any of his buildings because the prosecutors will just do it for him 😂
“Owes” is jumping the gun! Especially since it’s highly evident where all this is coming from-manure pile.
He can’t borrow all that easily since any financial institution with an operating license in New York is off limits to him.
Total BS. Forbes is a hack.
I’m questioning if this channel’s content is really from Forbes. Always seems very biased towards all things 45, and somewhat light on researched facts.
Dear Google, I’m so sick of the fraud Ads you allow I’m thinking of breaking up with YouTube. Give some thought to that, especially those $6400 ads. Really sick of those.
Mexico is paying
Forbes doubling down on propping up a con man! Great job!
Forbes is assuming that Trump’s balance sheet is true and accurate.  Bad move!
Because the banks will givehim loans? Because they understand this travesty?
Forbes is a bias reporting agency.
looks like someone's getting called out for inaccurate reporting.  All right Forbes let's see how this pans out...
Where is he going to find a loan? MBS? Russia?
I don't see why the supreme court can't put a stay on the fine until it goes through appeal.
God and angels on his side. Why is this always come up when election come up?
Some distasteful autocrat might bail him out.
He'll withdraw it from his offshore bank account that Russia funnels money to.
Two years ago Sylvester Stalone bought a mansion in Florida for $35 million and it could fit in one wing of Trump's mansion. so go figure. Judge Gorgon is a fraud.
If the Orangeman is worth so much, why is he asking the courts to extend him 30 days to settle the Judgement against him? One would think, hed fork over the money promptly--if he had so much on hand in his account alone. You can rate him all you want--bet you wouldn't loan him any money. Am I right?
Sin in.law got 2 billion from arabs.  That would help him. One man.   2 BILLION for what?
Talking about election interference.  Let me guess what's next, they will sue him for being white?  Two  tiered judicial system on full display here
Forbes is a MAGA supporter that's why they falsify the real facts.
😂😂😂😂
Forbes has lost all credibility.And if he had the money why did he not put up the bond😂
Incorrect: Trumps lawyers DID NOT appeal the civil fraud judgement yesterday. There were merely notices filed of intent to appeal. So until an actual monetary Bond is posted, the 30-day clock continues to tick, and daily interest still accrues.   Also, despite Trumps vast assets, he is clearly too stupid to make a sound decision at this point, that would legitimately work in his best interest.
Forbes shoulda done their homework before posting this.   Completely inaccurate
Who would want to loan at any normal interest rate, someone found to have engaged to deception to banks. It has to be a weird lending source like a foreign leader or billionaire.  I dont think he has any billionaire friends though.
Lets see how that works for him
Is any of this true?  Part of Trump's loss in court was due to his categorizing non-liquid assets as liquid in his declarations.
cause the saudis will pay it ?😂 corrupt
Disagree very strongly. House of cards. Just look at how much he will make off of 40 wall street
Putins got it covered
Didn't just get like 4+ billion from his social media site?
Forbes is fake news
Sounds like you guys are inflating his property values too. Maybe you should be indicted by Latisha James too.
This is so full of incorrect information.
He not going have to pay this because new York state target him  if they went after him they have to go after every one else that does the same thing in new York  only reason they went after him is he's running for president
He wants to use RNC funds to pay his legal expenses. Loser.
Forbes, I'll bet you $1M that you're WRONG!
This whole thing is so corrupt and someone needs to be disbarred! This could happen to anyone doing business in New York. Bottom line all investors run from this nasty state.
Why would any banker make a loan to a man who has been convicted of defrauding lenders? Why would any prospective purchaser not wait until the desired property is up for government auction?
Why the annoying music? Do you think you are a video game?
1. Is it confirmed those properties are clear of leans? 2. What banks are going to step into this mess? 3. There's a race condition with getting this money. Selling a golf course doesn't happen over night
Elon Musk will give him the money
So why is he asking for $$$ on go fund me?
"RUSSIA! IF YOU'RE LISTENING, I NEED 500 MILLION DOLLARS!" - DJT
There are probably very few US banks that could handle that size loan that are not also registered in NY. Never mind if they are willing to take the risk. Remember, he is going to lose ALL his appeals, it will just take some time. Any private or foreign benefactor would be a drag on his campaign. "In ___'s pocket." etc. Forbes' estimates are historically awful too. I highly doubt he has anything approaching $400M in liquid assets. He also needs that money for E Jean Carrol in a few days, and there is no sign he has made any progress toward securing a bond.
Did not appeal. Simply declared the intent to appeal. Without that huge bond, he can't proceed to appeal.
He will be getting 4 billion when truth social goes live...
But who would loan the grifting fraudster any money?
How can he borrow money if he can't deal with any bank license to do business in New York State?
And yet still not posting bond!
dont forget about his loyal supporters imagine if just 10 million of trump's supporters give him 10 dollars a month thats is 100 million a month and 1.2 billion every single year, and its tax free
uh uh you guys are as big of liars than donniedoy.you have no credibility
Because they are in a trust
A con man fleecing his gullible and misinformed supporters to pay his legal bills and fines.
His assets are under monitorship. Let's see how well that works out.
Because there's no equity in his buildings.... He uses it to pay for his next building. Better question: How many millions have the tax payers bankrolled his failures?
You a lie!!
Well why hasn’t he posted a bond? BS… your savior fooled you!
Bwhahaha
Forbes has become a f****** joke
"mortgage-free properties"  You mean the ones paid for and owned by his Russian Vor funders.   They will not be happy if their collateral gets auctioned off to pay his judgements.  Forbes:  you're not good at your job
He can't borrow any money from any Bank licensed to do business in New York to pay his fine in New York
Because even the possibility that you might be President does wonders for your credit with Russian oligarchs.
It will be tossed out on appeal. Lawlessness
This sounds a lot easier than the asset and cash crunch which is turning into a high speed car crash in real time.  Words like   "if" "could "  " theoretically" etc  are no use to possible lenders .
I want some of what you're smoking bro
How does Forbes know ?  No one knows his status.
Forbes is full of it💩💩💩💩🤡
Here for the expert comments 🍿
"Every asset of his that's ever scrutinized by an interested party becomes less valuable but we're confident all these self reported numbers are definitely good." Forbes needs to be erased from the Internet.
Again. I'm a billionaire, but my bank account disagrees.
Why is he selling sneakers? Full of 💩🤡
This sounds like bullshit. We'll see how it ages.
All of the bills they claim he owes are falsified anyway. He doesn't actually owe nothing because it's all accusations made by  laws that really do not actually exist by unlawful criminals. A crooks system.  By crooks. They will regret their actions.
You forget his supporters.  There is a "go fund me" account that's growing pretty fast.
BS! Real estate is only worth what someone is willing to pay and knowing he needs the money you would never pay full price.
That would be a funny meeting to watch. "I'd like to borrow money, to pay the fines I got for defrauding people I borrowed money from."
This is the magazine that had Elizabeth Holmes and Sam Bankman-Fried on the cover as icons. Forbes LOVES fraudsters!
This is hogwash. If he could just write a check, he would have already done it. The fact of the matter is he has to put up a bond for the total amount of $354K, which he hasn't done so far. As a result, he's accruing $114,553 a day in interest fees. So, the so-called multi billionaire is just a sham just like his entire life has been. It seems like he's just running his businesses like a ponzi scheme.
Forbes and more lies.
Happy to hear this news! Looking forward to seeing every dime confiscated!
He won't have to pay because the case will be overturned in a true higher court.  If he is guilty of overstating the values of his properties, then so are most sellers and homeowners getting a refinance.
Forbes is a propoganda rag. Forbes is always WRONG.
LOL he couldn't even afford to put up the bond while he appeals so James can just start taking his property anyway. Forbes is a JOKE
Baaahha  That is a a lot of bs.  Obviously he would have paid it if he had it, he does not have it.  The interest is the problem.  The 91 felonies may have an effect too.  He is having problems with the bond and he does not have the cash.
New York legal system became a banana republic. How sad.  Corrupted prosecutor and partisan judge. It never happened in NY legal history.  NY became a global financial hub because it had balanced judges.  No anymore.
Obama propaganda where you can say something with it not being truthful do your history LoL 😜🤣😁😎🤓👅👊👍‼️💯🇺🇸
Let’s start writing $$!
Forbes is willing to go down with this shipwreck
I keep trying to block Forbes, but they seem to keep finding loopholes and getting through😫🤬
Go to Texas LoL 😜🤣😁
0:33 “Trumps balance sheet is strong enough” …Forbes is believing Trumps balance sheet? 😂
All BS
March 22 tic tock tick tock with 180 thousand per day in intrest and climbing...basically this dead line is like next week in dog leg years. Start paying up Donny like stop EVERYTHING ELSE AND MAKE THIS HAPEN BY MONDAY (and remember the chances of your appeal being successful are super slim) just man up and pay up. Ya done did it to your self! You hired em after all.
Trouble with debt is it needs to be serviced.  He needs cash flow and many of his assets are money losers.  Commercial property is in the toilet with occupancy cratered and nobody will believe what he says these assets are worth given the penalties he owes are because he fraudulently stated there values all along.
Biden is King of the toilet
Palm Beach Daily News:  "For the 2023 tax rolls, the county appraisal team this month assigned Mar-a-Lago an estimated market value of $37 million and a preliminary taxable value of about $33.4 million..."
If thats the case why is it taking so long for him to pay up. You would think a man of his wealth could at least put up part of the money upfront to reduce interest cost. Unless, hes not that rich.
We all know the saudis and the ruzzians are lining up to cover their puppets pockets.
Forbes is not a good form of journalism. They are bias.
He could, he could, he could, BS if he could he would just to avoid the interest. He cant, he can't, he cant, thats why he hasnt. He is a total fraud and this is one of those cases that prove it. Facts matter, if he could get out of this or stop the interest from accumulating on a daily basis he would. He hasn't because he cant. Pull your head out, face reality, he wont and cant even do that!
It looks like he didn't bond out. They are going to collect assets now.
our whole judicial system is a sham.  We literally have Biden on tape blackmailing prosecuter in Ukraine during his VP to not investigate hunter biden
He wont have to pay any judgement. Its a Marxist set up.
So if this is true, why hasn't dt posted his bond?
Americans don't believe a word of this ! DJT 2024 !
Von Shitzenpants may have a big cash pile, but he needs most of it for his fancy diapers.
Forbes is full of cr😆p!
All these commenters literally know nothing about the business world.  There are such entities such as LLCs and Corporations to protect against personal lawsuits.
Forbes is a joke!
AAAAHAHAHA. "Mortgage free real estate" and "Mar-a-Lago worth $300m"  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ok Forbes. Welp glad I know to never trust anything this sham of a company tries to tell me again. But please, by all means, keep putting a neon sign on your head that tells the world you're as biased as you are. I'm sure that will go great for you.
No one would take his stupid failmansion for collateral, the ENTIRE reason he even has it is because the original owner determined it was a failed project and a waste of money, she then DONATED it to the US government, which then also determined it wasn't even worth the money to upkeep, and then ditched it, where Donny picked it up out of the trash at a bargain price so he could turn around and pretend it was actually worth something.
Funny forbes lol donald trulmps thinks mar o lago is worth 1 billion dollars lol
PTL!
A bunch of TDS here.  wow
Mara logo isn't worth 300 million...more like 30 million..
Good to know.
Lol he's a fraud just like Biden and every other politician.
Judge coming up with such an outrageous amount because they are trying to do is bankrupt/punish him  so he'll drop out of the race. Shame on you, Judge, for your obvious intent. You're disqusting.
Forbes estimated it's worth??? Wow... That means absolutely nothing. And also if Frump appealed yesterday why is Forbes talking about he won't have to sell anything? He has to pay the balance before he can appeal and he hasn't done that yet. This post is just a flat out lie because it was just reported that Frump missed the bond deadlines for both E. Jean Carrol and the NY fraud cases. Damn Forbes why don't you just crawl into his pants?
Wrong, wrong, they can go after his physical assets including any buildings or any buildings he has interest in they can force him to sell any percentage interest he has in a business so you're wrong.
He's a this
It's funny to see Forbes, lying more than Faux News.  In a business where credibility is critical, Forbs may be trading on the penny stock market soon.
This chick is a trip
Forbes likes to put fraudsters on the cover. From Forbes to prison.
NEWS BREAK:  the orange menace is NOT a billionaire, but you are not the brightest bulb to say he is
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t put Humpty together again.
Is this really accurate information? I doubt it
There is no crime so there shouldn't be a judgement at all it should be dismissed and it will be when it gets to the Supreme Court.
Dude is LOADED
$300 million??? Worth 27 million if that much! Kitchen doesnt pass health inspection same with his golf places. Mara Largo full of mold according to news!!!
If he had the cash on hand, he would have paid the bond BEFORE filing for appeal the way every other defendant has in the history of these cases.
YUP AND WHEN THE TAXES COME DUE ON ALL THOSE PROPERTIES HE WOULDN'T HAVE A DIME TO HIS NAME... NICE TRY! i BELIEVE SOME OF THOSE PROPERTIES IS NAME ONLY THAT HE LEASE'S HIS NAME SORRY FOR CAPS DUMB KEYBOARD...
How many of those properties also have inflated value?
Forbes has NEVER been accurate about DJT's wealth. Mara Lago is worth $300 million? Weird how the Florida TAX ASSESSOR says it's only worth $27 million.  Considering he has a HISTORY of committing fraud OVER & OVER, for decades, and how he destroys just about every business he touches. I can't imagine anyone loaning him that kind of money. Unless they're stupid.
No mansion in the united states has ever sold for 300 million. Forbes is a joke.
Because he doesn't have nearly enough equity to pay the fine! 🤣
1:33
Good to hear.  Pay up.
Forbes: A six letter word for lies and propaganda.
You're a liar Forbes you billionaires have to bail out your puppet don't you
Sell the NYC property.
But does he own these properties! He was lending his name to others.
Its only worth what someone will pay for them.
Fake news....but the base will believe it so forbes is getting whay they want....deflection
Sounds like a whole lot of bullshit from Forbes 😂
Clickbait.
What about the foreign loans that are about due he needs to keep out of buildings with more than 2 floors if he's smart. They will collect. 😂😂 LOOK The ORANGE fish is playing with that great big white fish with a dorsal fin and Biggly teeth😅
Forbes USED to be credible……not any more!  😡
He just needs to sell a couple million pairs of those ridiculous shoes.
Please,  if Orange Julius was as wealthy as he says he is he would have just written a check the day the fine was imposed! Not selling shoes, t-shirts, and hats like a flea market vendor!
Hahahahaha.
What BS!!! Forbes is using Trump’s estimates of what the properties are worth.
These will all be appealed after the election
1:35 ummmm, no, nope, wrong, wronnnnnggg!!! $18M tops! 😂 fkn joke
LOL    you wanna bet,   he has no money
When you say borrow ain’t that what got us to this point! Looks like the Russians will have to step up! But dumb conversation , $540,000,000.00 is what it is! Forbes ain’t what they use to be, lost credibility!
Well now i know to never ever trust FORBES for financial information
Who said he was going to sell a building?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 SURE DUDE
Nothing this channel reports is accurate, nothing.
Forbes lies!
Bwahahahahaha this is false He doesn’t have the money and he can’t raise half a billion to pay his fines He could barely pay the $5 million fine last week  Bwahahahahaha  Troglodytes
I don’t believe this information is valid
If he was of sound mind he could.
So why he dont pay his dam bills instead of wasting courts time.
Why is trumpos begging to delay this judgement?!! LOOK HIM UP
Wait, the  financial magazine that out Dumps financial officer in jail for perjury for lying to the court about lying to said financial magazine, is now lying for the liar who forced his employees to lie?
So, why is he selling shoes?
You can't seize a third party's building. He only has concessions in the lobby. He used to be the landlord for the chinese and russian foreign agents but became potus.
It is like they want to be able to say he was taking bribes for favors in the future if he doesn't sell to pay the fine.
His swamp castle in Florida is nowhere near worth $300 million.  It's one hurricane away from being a sandbar.
No business is going to loan money to a man who has been convicted of fraud that is why he can not get a bond. He has to pay that in cash or with the seized property, money and other accounts. So no he will not just be able to pay and be fine.
Sorry Forbes, you have no cred here. You, not only fell for Donald’s financial lies, you failed to mention that the $454 million is ONE judgment only and doesn’t include interest. Second, you have failed to do your due diligence on more than one occasion. SEE ALSO: Kylie Jenner’s false financial claims to Forbes.
*According to Forbes, I’m probably worth $2.9 million. Not sure how but I’m rich baby!* 😂
Do you REALLY BELIEVE THIS? - "He has around $400 million of liquid assets on hand, so he could simply write a check to pay much of what he owes right now."
Forbes you guys really don't get it.  Seems a lot of wrong information from your staff, not digging deep enough, has propelled you to who cares news. Do the work. Earn that name.
Any other business would have gotten shutdown over Trump's convictions. This is corruption.
“Even a foreign entity could pay as a means to curry favor”. Burying the lead.
Wishful thinking. Forbes is part of the problem.
Because the properties will be seized.
90 years later, and the always-fascist-curious American business elite think their little Business Plot is still in play.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot
Fake post 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Donnie is mortgaged to the hilt. He’s been living off of a running tab of ever increasing bank loans. Accountability is here.
boo
He doesn’t get to set the values of the property…the moderator does. Also…who is going to lend to him?
Foreign funding would be a bad idea.  That could easily be considered a campaign donation.
Just checking in on the thinkers.
Are you using real figures or his numbers? Or are you saying he is is for sale like stormy?
Sell this corrupt discussing Judge He could bring in 10 cents more
Nobody trusting you Forbes, know it
I can only hope legacy media like Forbes goes out of business in this digital age
The premise of this video is flawed He owes the money because he hasn't played fair with banks in getting loans No bank in their right mind is going to give him a loan without substantial interest and a crazy amount of collateral As for getting money from a rich foreigner goes, that is its own nightmare scenario of having someone who is running for president being deeply indebted to a foreign power  As for the flip side of this argument, selling his properties isn't going to go well for him either Since anyone buying is going to know that he's in deep financial crisis and has to sell So he's going to get low balled at every turn If he doesn't sell then it goes to auction and the bids will be even lower  His best option is to continue to grift his followers and drain the coffers of the RNC to have them pay his debts for him
Since when is Twizzlefuck’s balance sheet believable   For him, I hope he has enough equity in his properties and he finds a willing lender!  Although it still begs the question.  Why didn’t he include a bond either his appeal?  And good luck finding a bank, which doesn’t do business in NY
Ya gotta pay ...ya gotta pay your bills
How does this Forbes "journalist" know for sure that all the properties are "mortgage free"?
Forbes just gave Russia the green light.
Sounds like u are using his personal estimate inflated value! Maralago is worth 24 million not 300! Lol😂  And the golf courses have also lost value!
Forbes has been conned by Donnie himself . . . looks like they haven't learned a thing. 👎
Dude can't even get loans. Seriously, who writes this stuff
Just Woke. If it was that easy, why didn't he pay his bond? An Appeal without a bond won't stay the process, which will cost him $111.000 per day. Not a very clever action. But with the best US lawyers, this is a well-designed plan.  🙂lol L
This is our way of life now, lying and lying and lying to get ahead. I just hope our children and next generations will not become generations of liars. So God help us.
And yet he'll bet for donations
This is why I would never trust Forbes.
It was 2 billion in his Truth Social shares.
2:50  Question: So he has a right to appeal, but between the amount wanted which is quickly approaching half a billion dollars, and the fact that he can’t do any business with any bank in or operates in NY, wouldn’t that basically take away his right to an appeal?   By making it incredibly difficult to appeal if not impossible, would that be a breach of constitutional law?
He probably doesn't have $400M liquid. Second he can't get a loan from a bank that does business in NY. So pretty much any bank of significance is out. I guess he can borrow from the First Bank of Moscow.
Don't forget his golden Treason high-tops .
Trump's gotta get a reverse mortgage like in the Tom Selleck commercial. It's not just another way for the banks to get your home.
What a joke  355 million to 454 million the price just keeps getting more imaginary
It is not how he can pay, it is if he will pay! He is a deadbeat, the only thing he ever paid back was Stormy Daniels.
The US Government Is The Biggest Criminal Organisation in the World!
Forbes is the worst pile of garbage business media I've come across
2:59 Forbes is literally saying a potential president be swayed by foreign entities who he owes millions too…. That in itself should disqualify him as a candidate
Lll
Ads from the Liar in Chief; I just lost my breakfast on the screen.
Based off of this ruling could banks or the government go look at every loan that wasn't in their favor and sue?
Is the value of his properties what they really are valued at, or what he claims they are valued at... we've been down this road before.
For him to borrow, someone would have to be willing to lend.  Let's see if anyone steps forward to lend this deadbeat a few million.
Whats his total and after all Criminal charges, like El Chapo how much does he loose ?
Hope you guys didn't take Donnie's word on building's $$value. Oh dont 4get hes dutch bank loans due this year app 250/300 million.
Bad AI
He won't have to sell any buildings, yet, but soon.
lol it’s cute you think that verdict is going to stand 😂
Yah Right,
Proud Black Woman Christian Conservative Voting 3rd time for President Trump2024-2028 Saving Our Country Again ❤🙏👍!
I’m saving this post to see whether Forbes retracts this. He can’t borrow from any bank all the big ones are SEC registered w/ NY.
I love these video which are in a sardonic tone. Putin wont lend him money anymore. I think rumpies boyfriends have become disenchanted with him and so China wont give him money either. Oh wait there is that more than 2 billion that the Saudis gave him for the secret documents he sold them. Maybe daughter/wife and kush kush will bail out daddy?
Or, the Republiclowns and his other Trumpanzees could just close the books and let him get away with all of his criminal behavior so he could duck the charges.
So, now do we look at the loans and dealings of those properties too? Once a frauder, always a frauder!
What makes you think they are mortgage free??? Stop drinking koolaide, and his fees are for just three crimes, there are 88 to go
Does anyone really believe this false post? Come on Forbes your rep is trash now.
He can always borrow the money from Rudy 🤣😂🤣🤣
Forbes = the National Enquirer of financial literature.
How many criminal charges will put him behind bars ?
Maybe Putin can help him out...............................
BECAUSE. He doesn't own all of them. He lends the name on many. Geezus you people
He could sell the secret documents he stole to one of our enemies or to his buddy Vladimir. BIDEN2024
Too bad Letitia!
Lock him up.
Lies Lies Lies
Well, he did sell one recently, but he didn't need to.
0:59  You can not “simply write a check” for half a billion dollars.  Who made this video? Do you know anything about banks or finance?
Reported for misinformation
He's broken, no cash.  Lie's about everything. Didn't post Bond for the rape charges conviction.  today is 02-28-2024.
Forbes is as believable as Fox news.
He's gonna have to sell something$$$$$$$
He could borrow money from Kushner. Thats why Jared cashed in his 2 billion Saudi deal. But, I don't think Jarad has him on his friends list these days. 😂😅
Can’t wait till trumps back in the White House
This was an abuse of the law and has turned the courts into disgusting mockeries of justice. Just because he doesnt have to sell his buildings to pay the fine doesnt make the fine any less egregious. DEMOCRATS are democratic in name only, they go after their political enemies like communists.
You use a bondsman just like any defendant would.
Fix your microphone geez when did this become ameture hour
🤣
He just sold his gold tennis shoes for $300 million !
he cant borrow from any bank that does business in NY.
Well, he better get with it - even if the properties are worth what Forbes said (which the New York trial itself brought into question), he can't get a loan from any bank that is registered in New York.  The point here isn't whether or not he loses buildings - I'm sure nothing would please the opposing parties more than for him to put the money up straight-away.  Saves them the problem of having to do a seizure process.
Mar a lago is incorporated in a NY business.  Forbes hasn’t done their research.  This is a gross misrepresentation.
His name is not worth what it once did.
Magot Lardo
Biased ruling. You sue him then say he cant get a loan etc. It proves its political witchhunting
What happened to the $350,000,000 verdict?????? It will eventually be tossed.....
Ok.... then why did he file his appeal without a bond?      Cmon forbes.   Be better.  You know very little of this info you spewed here is false
He better do it now, the clock and interest is ticking.
it is not about him selling anything it is about his things, getting seized keep propping him up the whole world see's what you are
The problem: he has to borrow from a bank that’s not registered in New York!  That’s part of the order.
📞  MOTHER RUSSIA 🇷🇺 PUTIN BEST FRIEND.
Tow the line Forbes.
If they know he needs the money now, the worth may go down.
You left out the most obvious. This ridiculous witch hunt is appealed and overturned and he sues the a$$ off the witch hunters. And with the number of people that are coming to the realization how corrupt these attacks have been and the increase in support for him because of it, he probably stands to gain money.
NYC is a dump. Never going there ever again.
I question if this video will age well.  The lawyers in all of Trump's lawsuits will get their money by having assets seized if they must.
I know you put a value of $300 on Mar A lago.. where did that number come from? An actual evaluation or from what he or his company states? Same with the other properties?  What bank will attempt to loan him money against them?  Now.. what if we were to endeavor to use the values he lists with the IRS.. you know, when he wants to pay little to no taxes?  That's what this whole case revolves around.. 1 value for loans and a much lesser one for tax purposes? Sure, most people attempt to play the same game but they find a middle ground.. not blatantly raising and lowering them to fit the want.  So, again.. which valuation is Forbes using?  Let Carrol and the State of NY sell his properties at what he registered the values at with the IRS!!!  HAHA want to see him cry?  What about selling his properties?  Who would venture to buy them?  How many are even turning a profit? It seems wonderful that he has 21 mortgage free properties until you realize he's using one to fund the expenses of another. Go ahead, tell me which properties are even close to breaking even, let alone turning a profit.  What a joke
From what bank or loan company?
B.S. He has yet to come up with a bond !
It was just a notice of his appeal, not the actual appeal.
Booo
Yes, he's not going to sell anything. New York state is going to take it 😉
BS he doesnt pay his bills.
This is wrong on every level
#Forbes is self-seeking #JunkNews
There's no way Mar-a-Lago is worth $300M. Its under 20 acres. The buildings just aren't that nice either.
I would not doubt that some of the sub contractors that worked on trumps properties have put a lien on the property due to non payments.
Forbes has lost its credibility long ago.
But he lied to forbes so cant use that as a starting point qnd why hasn't he posted bond fir his appeal?? So false video
Listen to that. Forbs finally narates thier articles. They used AI instead of a real person. It is easy to tell that is AI.
So what? He still has to pay and there's more coming as the civil suits brought by Capitol Police and members of Congress get their day in court. What is really saving him are the millions of fools who keep sending him their hard earned money because they have fallen for his lies.
AI, AI, AI. So much dork.  Forbes calls this news? Massive fail.
Mara Lago is with 1/10th of what Forbes claims here.  This is a joke.
I think he should sell one of these properties to show how stupid the judge and James are
NY will be paying him after this is over
But who will let him borrow against his assets?  Everyone knows his paperwork to do this will be fraudulent
Lets see? I doubt he has the money to pay or else he would have, liens are soon to follow! A compromised potential president is dangerous to the USA, Perhaps he will ask Russia to help him in return for all of Ukraine?
Wow! Just look at the ALL the Financial and Real Estate Experts leaving comments!
Payback through dopey donors
Mar a Lago would only be worth $300M if it was a private residence which the deed forbids
I don't know anyone that will get that amount of money from a human being in a lawsuit. The more they pick with him, the more voters he has in his base. If he wins,that lady lawsuit will be overturned by the next appointed judges 😂
You failed to mention that every day he doesn’t pay the fine, an additional $114,000 in interest gets added on, and that does include during the entire appeal process
Who is telling the truth about trump's wealth?
This is Forbes? Fox must have acquired them.
Trumps lawyers filed a letter of intent to appeal, not an appeal itself. In order to file an appeal, you first have to hand the money over to an escrow account.
He's got 30 days from the judge's filing to come up with the bond in EJC2 and we're pretty close to that deadline now. If he can't come up with $90 million to appeal, how's he going to come up with $450 million to appeal or pay off the other finding? And why is he asking for no bond or reduced bond in the EJC2 finding? If he has the cash, why does he keep asking for delays, lowered bond for appeals and just overall making excuses?
This is OBVIOUSLY FAKE NEWS and AI generated! SHAME ON YOU FORBES!!!
It's all political. Democrats cheating using the justice system. In 2020, they used Covid now the indictments.
He's got to pay up and still with him only filing a notice of appeal  he still has to put up a bond  and his property is still up for grabs and he only has twenty some days left
Yet He continually grifts off of his naive  followers to pay his legal bills ??? What a Piece of work ! Just goes to show how much He cares about anybody BUT himself WAKE UP MAGA!!!
Maybe Forbes should have waited to see where he gets the money before getting burned again.
Okay. Then why hasn't he posted bond yet? Why is he trying to delay even posting the money? Trying to appeal the ruling without putting up the money is playing with fire.
BECAUSE HE WON'T PAY A DIME, AND NEITHER SHOULD HE! THAT CROOKED "JUDGE"NEEDS TO BE DISBARRED!
Your number are totally wrong!
Hahaha that would be rich! To borrow money to pay the ridiculous stupid judgement on borrowing
This is literally all bullshit.
suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure he wont. wacky reporting from forbes lmfao
Delusional
Meh, we'll find out in 3 weeks!
I wonder if any part of this amazing reporting by Forbes is accurate…
Mara A Lago is worth $1B. Estates down in Palm Beach are selling for as 100Million.
He should sue New York for the all the lies
Maybe he should sell a line of gold colored adult diapers.
Banana Republic New York has gone full communist way to go citizens you have to deal with this now and you did it to yourself 😂😂😂😂
Baloney, nobody's going to lend this freak any money except maybe Russia.
Forbes, Newsweek, Time, ...... were sold to the same 11 year old.
Because Putin will have to continue to pay America for trumps mistakes 😂
Latisha 🐒
But the judge said it was worth 18mil lol we all see the corruption
Because she will have them seized....  Saved you a watch.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If that is the case then Rump should step up and start paying
Russia already sent the check?
I keep up on everything related to this topic. You are very vague and there's a lot of inaccuracies. You are leaving out key details. For the average individual watching this video, I would consider them being misinformed by you.
Forbes Probably funded by the CORRUPT Democrat Party 👎👎🇲🇽🇲🇽🇨🇳🇨🇳👎👎👎👎
The voice of the person on this site cant hold my attention no matter the topic .needs work!
Then why did he not pay the bond in time. NY state is about to go after his assets at their discretion. Great reporting ...  the lies here are astounding.
Lol cope
Mabe because the trial was a complete farce. Mabe because the judge was a openly liberal and completly bias pos. Appeals court is gonna throw this ruling out.
How about because he'll win on appeal.
YOU HAVE IT ALL FIGURED OUT FOR HIM, ONE SMART ONE IN THE BUNCH.
First it was 350 million then 400 million now its over 5 hundred million.
He Won’t Have To Sell Any Buildings Because THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE THEM!
Lol wouldn't it be funny if he sells one of his buildings just to see a load of illegal immigrants moving in there? I think nyc would do it because there is a claim that there is no more room that's why they are being stacked in luxury hotels/
So many triggered people. Political vendetta
Yes, sure
Yet he kept asking for donations and selling sneakers and perfume.
How come every charge that comes up is fraudulent?
Yeah, this video is going to age like milk. And then Forbes will delete it and pretend it never existed. Just one giant bootlicking clown show.
We will see! thanks for sharing
Yes, but what financial institution will want to loan him the money?
This sounds like monopoly
Bullshit
So why doesn't he pay it. Talk is cheap
EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO THE JOKER......4:05   Can you imagine being accused of rape and clearly you didnt do it because if you did you would go to jail and having to pay 88 million dollars?Thats a lot of money he worked for.
The proof he does not have the cash is the moment he said that he has it. Enuf said bruh
Maybe he could theoretically come up with the $540M, but he hasnt.  And since he hasnt posted a bond his assets can be confiscated without any input by him on what should or shouldnt be sold.  And I doubt anyone will loan him the money at this stage.
What that Mara Lago is only worth 18 mil... This whole scam is baloney.
because he has 7 billion $
Not the most likeable person. but he is getting a beating , oh well,  do good and good will follow you, with all his ways he is still allowed to run for president
Putin will help him out. No problem.
He should invest in privatized Prisons.
This story is GARBAGE!  Did Forbes NOT read the judgment?  DJT CANNOT do business with any bank registered in NY (that's almost all of them, and certainly all the Big Banks that have that type of money to lend).  So where's he going to get the loan against any of his assets?  From a foreign bank?  Which would mean he is indebted to a foreign entity if he becomes president!!!  Also, there's the financial monitor to consider...since he's got to inflate his assests big time because if he has a net worth of 2.6 billion and he owes 500+ million, who is going to lend him 20% of his net worth considering his history of FRAUD, his financial hardship, and his brand going down the tubes.  Shows how Forbes really has no financial intelligence and should therefore be totally disregarded.
What reputable financial instituion lends money to a convicted FRAUD?
His fine 345 Mil +88 Mil plus now. Interest today alone is 114 million . Interest alone has been added since the verdict is piling up. He's well over half billion. Interest piling on every day
Think you could you turn the music up a little louder!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's funny Trump's supporters are in here saying how he's a lot more wealthy, but yet they're always donating to pay his legal fees and buying his $399 shoes (somehow after Biden supposedly "destroyed" the economy). Make that make sense.
O shut up!
And yet hes out selling NFTs and shoes, and befging for donations every hour, the emails i get.
He doesnt have to pay. You will see.
The entire point of the lawsuit was to make it unaffordable to appeal.  First mistake..   It will be overturned, 2nd mistake.   And he will then go after them..
Or better yet, why don't we stop jailing and bankrupting political opponents like some Marxist banana republic?
One has to wonder at what will prove to be the actual values of the properties when put up for loans.  Also interest rates on the loans.
因为川普无罪！！！
I cant believe how many people can be so dumb as to believe this joke of a verdict will stand. This is a clown show.
Because he doesn’t have to pay extortion fees. He’s guilty of nothing but being against the corrupt deep state and this is the only reason they are coming after him with all these bogus charges. Disbar them one and all that took part in these cases.
You didn’t mention the future 1/6 LAWSUITS THAT ARE COMING 😂😂😂
Liquid Assets does not mean bank balance, but does include it. This would mean selling a sizable amount of assets, likely devaluing them by selling sizable portions in a rapid manor.
This is the problem all americans have we are being robbed by the government who are not able to make any money but the can take somebody's money and possessions for their benifit taxing food should never be but it is a way of life in america their retirement benifits are way out of line and who pays for it the citizens 😊
You are delusional. If he had it he would post the bond!
Wow it’s so easy for him…. So y hasn’t he done it?
😂😂😂
Terrible reporting by an incompetent reporter. There is simply no way that all those properties are mortgage-free and/or not pledged as collateral for loans. That isn't how real estate investing works.
Total lie He’s in technical default and can’t get loans
0:50 I wish my value were that high when people say I'm lying...
The quality of this video is terrible. The narration can hardly be discerned under the volume of the bavkground video. Also even a person as inexperienced as I am can tell their "facts" are flawed. I wouldn't bet 50 cents on their conclusions. What a waste of time.
More judgments will be coming.
Is this a fantasy flick?
Don't worry, I'm sure his buddy Vladimir can loan him some more money.
Lot of people on here estimating the value of real estate that have no idea what they're talking about that's so funny😅😅😅😅
So who gives him this mortgage.  If I'm the loan officer,  I would do some real due diligence first.
Forbes is like the NY post total bullshit
NOT TRUE! HE HASNT EVEN GAVE THE BOND MONEY!
The fact that the massive real estate portfolio is  mostly mortgage free is a testament to how ridiculous the charges were!  How hard is it for someone with $2 billion dollars in paid off prime real estate to get a loan???😂
Lmfao if you believe this... I have beach front property in Nebraska to sell you.
This just in:  Forbes' source of information on Trump's wealth has been revealed to be a man named Ronald Gump.  COMPLETELY trustworthy and not biased at all.  Just like that 'credible' FBI guy.
Are you more upset with Forbes or that you clicked on the video.
what bank would lend him money to pay off fraud penalties ?
His MAGA followers will pay it
Forbes is spreading financial propaganda. Forbes is in love with Putin and TFG.
Trump's assets will be seized because he didn't pay the $450M bond.  That's why he doesn't have to sell them.  Lol
Forbes for insanity! Forbes for fraud! Forbes for destroying Democracy!
total bs
Hes too smart for all of them which is why they HATE him
Two tiered Justice system. If you are rich, you don’t have a follow the rules? I love the offense and pearl clutching of the super privileged, that one of their own face the consequences of their grift. He might not have to sell, but he will have to mortgage. Using foreign money, in a normal reality base world, should be disqualifying for a Presidential candidate, but hey, screw ethics! Right?
He won’t have to sell anything because his supporters are sending him money - all the while complaining that they can’t make ends meet.
This is absolute bullsh×t. He filed a notice of appeal without posting bond with the court. The appeal can't go forward without the bond money. He can't even pay e Jean Carol the 83M he owes her and did not post that bond either so he can't appeal. He doesn't have any cash.  It takes around 30 days to close on property. James is going to take his buildings. What does she want with a golf course? It's a lot harder to take buildings and golf courses not in new york, so she taking his ny buildings. Forbes is bullsh×thing you.  Correction: your appeal can go forward without the bond, but in the meantime the AG can and will take his assets.
Find a bank that will loan him money. Only a Russian oligarch would loan him money. Future president? The future is cloudy on that, nearly doubtful.
Good job actually pointing out his sexual abuse Forbes. The judge clarified that it was still rape.
Delusional
Here’s the thing, though in reality and truth, this is factual information he won’t have to pay any of it because these charges and fines are all illegitimate from illegitimate trials that were illegitimately conducted, and in fact the courts that did this need to worry about themselves, because not too long from now and due time they’re gonna be dealt with because they’re corrupt to the core and going forward Inger, Ron, and some of these other people and they’re gonna be charged with the crimes that they’ve committed Davedo not operate properly. They break the laws you can’t just do what you want that’s what they did to him and Eugene Carol that’s already blown to. She’s already been caught saying things so now she’s not gonna get any money. I think they need to worry about the crimes they’ve committed dead serious. They’re the ones that are gonna be in trouble cause they’re the ones that should be in trouble that’s the fact of reality
After the role Forbes played in grossly overvaluing Trump's assets (per other reporting and court transcripts) one would think Forbes would have had the humility and self-respect not to post this.
Why this judicial activism and banana republic tactic of persecuting political candidates who threaten the swampy status quo will end in disaster, and possibly a corporate fascist state.
They are using a Marxist tactic! Go after his money!! Typical
He won’t pay. It will be appealed.  It’s a witch hunt.
Can Forbes show their work as to how they came up with this?
Apparently Forbes has no credibility either.
I doubt he's really worth that much in cash.
Maralago is run down, moldy and bedbug-ridden.
The main reason he won't have to sell any buildings is that the lawsuit will be thrown out on appeal
Wow you don't know law.  Lol.......
0:35: and yet, despite your insistence that trump’s balance sheet is so strong he won’t have to sell a single thing, he so far has not made bond. And he’s selling gold-top sneakers, and he’s begging donors to help him. Someone at Forbes, PLEEEASE - explain why a supposed multibillionaire with a balance sheet strong enough to make a $500 million bond a) has not made that bond, and b) begs trailer park dwellers for assistance paying his legal bills.
Sure he has property he can borrow against, but who wants to lend to him? He’s burned bridges with all the lenders.
Who in their right mind would invest a penny in NYC  at this time?
He's a walking debt machine
Question: Do laws actually apply to the rich? Can rich people actually go to jail? We will soon find out.
🍊 Look, I am only looking for 11,780 votes (& voters who can loan me $540 million). 😂😂😂😂😂😂.  Maybe those golden calf sneakers were inflated.  They should get him for those.  Hahahah!  A pair of Jordan cost about $5 in China.
DWAC --SPAC-- 50% OWNERSHIP  mrkt value 1.6B pure trash 🗑..but he can monetize...  Full disclosure I'm short from $55...well see 👀
ROFLMAO... and you used? OH... CHUMP's false statements? The ones he is in FRAUD trouble for? And yeah... he appealed... but without a BOND. Which means NO GO BONZO. Let's watch him try to get ANY Lender to take this risk with his record. AND with the debt he has in tow.
Hold on there. Isn’t ther a overseer now on all his spending? And that Mara Largo quote is not accurate according to what was revealed in court. What’s up?
Don't forget, when he WINS his appeal, he's going to sue New York state, for the harassment, and the Interest on the money he had to put up in his verdict.
Forbes? How long do I have to stop laughing? Now, according to LAWYERS & LEGAL SCHOLARS, 30 days AFTER DJT's appeal is LAUGHED OUT OF COURT, team Carroll can start slapping liens on said  buildings.  Daily reminder, Republicans. Every donation you make to your GQP is a *DIRECT PAYMENT* to E. Jean Carroll. Have a lovely day! 🤣🤣🥰🥰
He won’t have to sell any buildings because this is all 💯 bullsh*t.
Missing from this "breakdown"... The fact that nobody would loan him $5m for his first judgement against E Jean Carroll. So if nobody is willing to loan him $5m then how on earth do you figure anyone is going to loan him $500m 🤔💭  Also, this guy just lost a case because he's fraudulently overestimating his worth. So the next thing you say is that "he says" that he has over $400m in cash on hand. I hope you see the issue here with this logic.
Time for Don the con to pay up in every way. No one is above the law.
1,000,000 YouTube comments from people who don't know anything about property valuation and assessment.
Who's bright idea was this?   Keep selling your soap.
That judgement is so corrupt. A large fine they made up even though nobody lost money
And don't worry he's not doing business in New York anymore for 3 years and plus he's being watched legally now
Don't worry he'll be broke soon enough 2.1 billion that's close to Jay z money😂😂😂😂
And most women will say that they look 10 years younger than they are.  lol
😂 right!
Why are you staring his balance sheet as fact, when we know it’s bulshit?
What bank wants to give him a loan knowing He doesn't pay back the people he owes
🍌BANANA REPUBLIC 🍌
Forbes has been publishing falsehoods about Frump for a while now - nobody who knows cares!
I think you are wrong. People don’t trust his balance sheets, many of his buildings loose money, real estate is a bad investment with a falling population—ask China, commercial real estate is even worse, post Covid’s paradigm shift.
Truth social makes a 3 million dollar advert revenue..while losing 24 million in expenses...     Its a vehicle to wash jareds dirty money....
This such bs. I mean the whole case is BS.  The courts are saying Maralago is worth LESS than what it was worth over 40 yrs ago. My personal property TAX VALUE has quadrupled in value in 30 years but there is no way I would sell for that low.
Stop it with the ridiculous soundtrack!
to keep it all in perspective his fines are 0.02% per day literally pennies on the dollar, if you owe me $1 and i say okay, every day you skip the payment, you owe me 2/10 of a penny extra, would you bat an eye
That is a ludicrous fine...who will they go after next.....
Good luck with that  he never had   Money required to appeal. ,!!     O one will lend him money!!!!!
Forbes estimate of Trump's wealth is based entirely on Trump's claim of his assets. Oddly, for someone with $400 million in liquid assets, he has been paying all his household bills with campaign contributions.
He wont sell his ...properties because he doesnt actually own half of them...
they say he owes  but last i checked he wasn't found guilty of anything
Because James is going to prison!
That's a nice story. Anyway he is made to pay is good enough for me. Let the chips fall.
I’m sure of that because of all the donations coming from his followers.
I thought he got sued for saying marlago was worth more than 18.as court assessed?
If he can afford to put up the bond, he should do it right away.  Paying interest is stupid- - what's the holdup?
He shouldn't pay a dime. Nobody was hurt, nobody has a claim. Everyone was paid, everyone was happy with pricing. Literally a victimless crime
If 'the Donald' is so awash in megabucks, why is he selling demeaning images of himself on the internet?   Not to mention the gold tennies -  these aren't the moves of someone with mass quantities of cash !     What you been smoking?          Forbes:  get a grip !         thanx for the video.
Why not sell access; Biden did it.
Lol, and we should believe Forbes? He can't even put the money into escrow for the appeal.
If he have all that money and asset, why the heck do he want to be a President?  He is not for the people.  He is hungry for power.  Jesus, is watching.  He needs to confess and repent.  Then sell everything he has to the poor.
The clock is ticking on the bond, ticktock, ticktock.
He’s a traitor. 6 January was an attempted coup. You believe him when he says he has 400 million in cash? HA HA HAHAHA 😂
Because, if needed, Americans 🇺🇸 will help him like he helps us 🇺🇸
Sounds like over inflated his wealth again good luck Donald lol . As a working human I’m worth a billion myself. The elite sure like to cover for each other 🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼
The same banks that were in the court case will lend him the money again. Knowing he's the best bet in the business.
Child Please 🙄🤣😆😅🥵IF he had ANYTHING close to this he would take several seats🙌.  He’s running Strictly to stay out of prison & to make money 💰💰💰💰💰🤷‍♀️
More Forbes bullshit
And yet he sells sneakers
because he fleecing his supporters
if he has it, the answer is simple: "if you don't pay, then we won't protect you.  you gotta pay your debts."
Is this meant to be a comedy sketch?
Ficticious charges..these NY judicial individuals are frauds need to been thrown in jail.
why would we trust forbes at all on this, they have been lying about his wealth for years
This video ended, appropriately, with a Biden ad. (at least it did on my device)
Mortgage free.....JAJAJAJA CRIME FREE ALSO !?!?!
never would I ever have imagined Forbes turn itself into trash tabloid fake news
He shouldn’t have to borrow anything. This is his property he work for it he owns it it’s being stolen from him.
No reputable bank would finance a loan to DJT at this time. He is a YUGE financial risk.
Forbes used to be on the money......bet you they are way off.
Fake billionaire just a fake baby!
Paid with Republican donors' money!
Worth 2 billion, has to pay 1/2 billion. No problem?
He shouldn't have to pay a dime to these extortionists
oh noooo they're going after Forbes' daddy, do something!!!!
The only one who assaulted E.Jean Carrol was Father Time.
Then write the check and quit talking.
This is BS. You do not know how much Trump‘s properties are leveraged. It is impossible for you to make these statements knowingly.
If Trump's company is dissolved, then what happens to all of the properties owned by that company?
the democrats are grandstanding.
…. So a guy who is legendary for not paying his debts and falsifying his assets value is going to get a loan from… Who?  Even for Forbes, this is terrible work…
He ain't paid  yet.  And the tab is running.
Too funny for words!  BS!
"former" yes, "future" no.   Forbes was also defrauded by Trump's inflation of assets
If you ever wondered what The Soviet Union looked like in the 50's and 60's look no further than NY State 2024
To borrow you must show ability to meet the repayments, not just have the capital. Banks will tell you they are in the money business and like to avoid being ihe debt collecting business.  His wealth is a house of cards
glad you are so sure. LOL
He may have his name on property deeds, but they're all leveraged and probably aren't worth a whole lot once the creditors get their cut 🤷
where are you driving these cost estimates from? This is an important question to address because he is literally proven to be lying about the value of his property?
More bullshit reporting.
Who put a chanalee
Because he's been notoriously straight about his assets...
Election interference ruling.  Designed to drain Trumps finances just before the election.
Or he could just steal all the RNC and doner money.
Ok sounds like it wont be a problem then. let's move on to the next issue.
I cannot believe the extent to which his haters are going in order to  punish/extort him in relation to his political efforts.  He is  an American defender on a mission.
what kind of propaganda is this? if he cannot post bond on EJC to appeal.....what does that say?
This video must be a joke or total BS
Fake news
😂 good luck 😂
1:02 Than why won't he, and It's has been 2 weeks.
I’m sure Russia would help pay for their puppet in the US.
0:34 oooor, he's been lying to you 😂 27 properties worth over 1B? Let me know how holding your breath goes Forbes
I don’t believe anything coming out of Forbes after watching this video, everything is way overvalued.
Fani sure is a fanny
Forbes. Nonsense.
That’s because he doesn’t have to come up with anything. Sheep.👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
If he wins, will he get that $450 million returned.
Russia will be happy to pay it! 😂
I think your facts are not correct. He has been loosing money on all his golf courses and nothing is debt free. Check it out!
😂As the left melts down yet again😅 Wait until he wins on appeal, they will resemble the wicked witch after Dorothy threw water on her.😅
He will be fine. Thanks for the good report.
DJT's already borrowed more than OUR time & energy over recent decades!!! He doesn't deserve any further leniency, consideration, empathy, let alone recognition & respect, that he was ever a leader of THIS built-by-immigrants country!!!😏
Who will appraise his properties for a loan now?
If so easy, why didn’t he post bond?
lol... coming from the folks who put him and Kylie on a list because they claimed they had money😂 He's broke and his properties are not worth enough.
Forbes... in on the GRIFT .
He’ll get it from his sheep.
How about we wager whether or not he’ll have to pay a dime?
No bro I disagree with you on this
When this case is tossed on appeal he'll make a profit when he charges James, Carroll, and Engoron. The money isn't to the lenders, it's to NY.
Businesses get out of NY while you can‼️ Come to Florida, No State tax, Sunshine 24/7, and no virus shutdown ‼️  There were no victims, no unpaid loans, no damages‼️ They will be after your business next‼️
Marlago land alone is worth 209-300 millions. Try to buy 22 acres beach property in Florida. If he has mortgage free properties then his net worth can be in the billions. Not hard to believe when his father left him 400 million
Most of his properties are mortgaged if not all. This is misinformation.
He wont have to sell any properties because they will take them! Thats the only way he can pay he has no cash he's a paper millionaire
Hes gotta pay 90 million bond for rape case by end of the week 😊
The LIES you tell.
Why can’t I hear him talk ????
Lmao where did they come up this bullshit!
I’m sure his new sneaker and cologne offerings will cover it. Weird that he has to keep selling these rinky dink products and nfts when he’s so filthy rich.
BLACKS MEXICANS NATIVE AMERICANS 12 TRIBES OF JACOB WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE TRUE HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE EARTH NO PORK LOBSTERS CRABS NO SHRIMPS NO CATFISH 💯💯💯💯
We know why … because as new ever to happen to USA in November 2024 as Dictator he will self excuse… and what will remain he will make the people pay to him he will collect taxes into his new personal accounts
Bulls#$ !!!!!!
Wrong!!!!! Its a NOTICE AND UNLESS THE BOND IS THERE, it goes no where!!!!!! ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ that’s just 1 civil case, you forgot E Jean Carroll $83.3 million with interest .
instead of saying  future president... should have said future dictator.
The case was bogus from the start. This is bad for business in NY and in all of the US.
Forbes is and has been in Donald Trump's coat pocket for years. They consistantly placed him in the Forbes Richest Men list when he wasn't eligible. He will probably get a loan from Putin or China to cover the cash needed. There is no way he has enough liquid assets. Full stop.
WOW,  totally opposite of what all the legal experts I listen to are saying.  That's why he is stalling and pulling even more stunts.  We shall see.
Because Russia is supporting him financially.
At $111,000 per day interest he’d pay if he had it. He’s so heavily leveraged he has no equity. Forbes liars:  if he had the cash he would not have to sell anything.
Seems they go out of their way to say all trumps stuff is mortgage free.....HMMMMMM......Sounds fishey to me.
look at all the mad libs haha
Is it because the economy is rigged and favor of the wealthy? Is it because we didn’t eat the rich in 2008? Is it because we didn’t destroy the banking system and start from scratch after they stole all of our houses? Is it because we still haven’t grounded their lawyers into dust and use them for ink to create a new glass steegle 2.0?
Oh bullshit, he's done!
I don’t believe it.
Forbes just can't quit Twump.
All fraud he doesn't have to pay squat
Some hostile foreign government will buy him and his debt.
Wonder how he’s going to pay Bubba?😂😂😂😂
FORBES has no credibility  😂
Since we're going after politicians for anything nowadays,  can we sue Biden for sending all our money to Ukraine. Or us he too "mentally unfit" for that as well.
Completely inaccurate!
Then they need to raise his fines or maybe his punishment should not be financial at all. Maybe he should have to perform restitution to those that he defrauded, perhaps by picking up garbage in the city or helping to unplug clogged sanitary sewer lines or some other public service.
Mark my words, this coming november a lot of people will be crying about the election results.
And pretty soon, the state of New York will own Trumps assets!!!!
He has borrowed against all his buildings, so he really doesn't have a mortgage-free real estate.
The Presidency is the least of the Peoples concerns at this moment, People want to know about what’s being done to correct all the injustices happening in our Country Military job cuts, skyrocketing food prices and why our Country is being systematically invaded.
Forbes estimates Mar a Lago is worth 300 billion😂😂😂😂. That's 260 billion over everyone else's estimate
Jared does have some bribe money from the Saudis.
He filed a appeal but didn't pay up.
I'm gonna have my house listed by FORBES IDEA of what its worth....
Probably because the lawsuit gets overturned
ain't nobody concerned with what he got to do to come up with the money pay the money you do what he want to with his but he all the state of New York and Miss Carol pay the money
Because he doesn’t own the buildings
Does this mean that everyone in NY with goods for sale must have the state place a value on it or risk being arrested  ?
But he doesn't have any money and it's over 500 million already. Forbes has been had. Borrow money from whom? Who isgoing to give him this money given his track record?
This appears to be misleading in some ways. It’s gives the impression that he has a lot of mortgage-free companies. Plus, he filed a Notice to Appeal, not an Appeal. Until he places the bond, it is not an appeal. Plus, he still needs to place a bond for the second E. Jean Carroll judgment, the time to place the bond for appeal comes due in a matter of days.
Is this a joke 🤣🤣🤣
Who was defrauded???
Because his daughter-in-law is going to fleece the RNC and its donors, that's why.
New York should pay back everyone living in that dump
GREAT 👍.
He will not be paying anything. It will be thrown out on appeal.
Trumps balance sheet….ohhh that’s funny
Because the traitor will get money from foreign despots!!
Without a victim, who does these millions go to?  This is such a farce.  Even the banks he borrowed from said there were no issues.
Off shore accounts are going to pay for his criming. It's all good.
Taking a loan against 50% of your liquid assets seems like it would be difficult to maintain payments.
So why does he ask for money from his fan base?  Is it that what you’re saying is false or is it that he is just stingy?
Your information is incorrect on so many levels.
Go away Forbes. Your opinions mean nothing
Forbes lies and has lost all credibility.
Lol I guarantee he WILL sell what’s left of his soul and classified government secrets to come up with the money.
Thought to appeal the judgment  he had to deposit the full amount of judgment ?    I believe he has only indicated that he plans to appeal   No deposit paid?
At what point is it cruel and unusual punishment when you’re charging interest like that and keeping him from doing business in NY. This is what people normally call a scam or a banana republic move
BS Forbes what a joke more lies
No cares how he can pay, we just want him to pay. End of story. Justice done.
Forbes supports billionaires that are sucking our country dry while the rest of us pay taxes that support the infrastructure that enabled them to make and hoard their wealth.
?
He has several overseas companies where his ties and shirts are made, paying employees like $10 a week...he will close them up
Same language...self grandiose
Forbes are shills for right wing America.
Then why has'nt he paid it yet? Idiotic report. End of story!
Betting your reputation on the condition of Trump's financial situation in public is just stupid.
I’m still confused about this case.. is the state saying that they were cheated out of property taxes ? Why does he have to pay so much money? What are the guidelines for the damages? You would think he’d have better attorneys
Dear Forbes, can you estimate my finances please? I need a raise.
So Forbes has no idea what it's talking about, Mar-A-Lago is worth less than 30 million dollars because of all the restrictions on it
Forbes is delusional.
Cry it all out, leftists. He'll be YOUR POTUS in 10 months.
FAKE NEWS, LETS SEE.
Please don’t let anyone suffering from TDS see this video, it could be catastrophic
😂😂😂😂 All lies!!! Mar-a-lago on the books 18million not 300million that was in the Fraud case.  Stop lying for him😂😂😂😂
Strange, the man postures like Hitler when speaking to his audience.
Forbes no longer has credibility.
He's making $4 billion of of Truth Social, and he's still not giving these crooks a dime.
he can make that overnight sellin sneakers lmao
This is TOTAL BS
The irony of paying $300M secured by the value of Mar-a-Lago, to pay off a judgement incurred by fraudulently overstating the value of Mara-a-lago as $300M.
So why he asking donations
The Cases are being Appealed. Leticia James needs to be Disbarred and Judge Engoron needs off the Bench.
Forbes= fairy tale numbers
All the groomers and fake social justice warriors in the comments are hilarious.
so instead of 'selling' he will need to 'borrow'. doesn't sound any better. imagine having to pay back or make regular payments (plus interest) on a $540 million 'borrowed' balance. doesn't exactly open up cash flow for him as more new legal cases keep mounting. looks like he'll need to grift his religious followers even harder...
And he still owes much, much more.  As for the estimates of how much he is worth is way too high, as well as the estimated vakue of the properties is lokely far less than estimated in the article.  A lot of his wealth is smoke and mirrors, bravado and bluff. He was never as wealthy as he claims and idiots like Forbes and Fortune 500 have never questiined anything he ever claimed, and have conspiciously avoided actually appraising anything he claimed or even verifying it.  They just go with what he says because he says so. Oh and please pay no attention to the hundreds if not thousands of people he owes huge sums of money to but has not paid.
He won’t have to sell his property because he is a self proclaimed “billionaire” plus, I can see him stealing from the RNC, CPAC donation funds.  Just as he did on the MAGA.  Later when the FTC comes after him for misuse of funds, he’ll claim he did nothing wrong.  - what a loser!
A smart bank wouldn’t loan him a penny.
😂😂😅😅
Damn he fooled you forbes ,he isnt worth as much as he ever claimed
There are empty lots surrounding mar lago worth 200 million 😑
It seems more and banks do not want to loan him money. Scotland course is losing money daily. Did you include his mounting legal bills??? If he has so much money why do I keep hearing about how he needs RNC funds to cover his legal, etc.   expenses???
Most of his properties are highly leveraged. No one is going to loan him 💩
Well, let's see how good he is! PAY THE DAMN FINES!
The values of these properties are inflated, also how many have second mortgages against them, but not to worry he will make the republicans pay for them, or the Saudi’s, or get a loan from Putin?
Like Forbes know how much Chump is worth he lies so much you don't know how much he owns on loans and how much he's making from putting his bs name on properties.... Let's see how well this video Forbes put out ages.
The state needs the money to pay climate change refugees
It's because he is not going to have to pay it.
He doesn’t own all of mar a lago the people who live there do
It’s cool, he will just miraculously sell 100 condos for 10x the listing price to some “investor” with Russian bank accounts
So how did the lawsuit even go through if Forbes says his property Mar a Lago is worth $300 million dollars if the problem was in court the AG said it was worth only $18 million?
Or he he could get himself in even more trouble trying to avoid being held accountable 😅
The tax man and the US government have brought down many a notorious figure and country who thought they were above the law, Al Capone, Russia....
Even in this report where Forbes is quoted as Mar-a-Lago being worth $300 million negates the unconstitutional ruling that his property was $18 million. The justice system is disgraceful.
This is what happens when you fire Timnit Gebru.
Laticia james looks like a character from crank yankers
he ain't giving you commies a dam thing
He will never pay a dime. The wholething is circus 😂
😂😂😂 And he is selling shoes 👟👟😅 right
Shes not siezing anything
History has shown that Forbes estimates of Trump's wealth have been WAY OFF ... ludicrously inaccurate.
Why do stupid people lose 450 million for stupid decisions..sick of political power....power....power...The 450 million could help the city of Philadelphia solve the problem of the homeless citizens living on the city streets.
He cant even cover the bond. Once again you have poor people speculating unless you are a millionaire you are poor. One of my millionaire friends once told me rich people dont have more money they just play with bigger numbers and one slip up and they are no longer millionaires
AND LATIFFA JAMES WILL SOON BE OUT OF A JOB  TRUST ME
Biden 2024🇺🇸
THIS ENGORON FINE IS NOTHING LESS THAN A "NY MA F IA S HAKEDOWN." ITS ILLEGAL AND A CRIME.
We shall see if the Republicans party still wants to continue paying Donald’s bills. He is known for never paying his own even when he has the money.
Click bait bs
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Boring.
He's going to bust open the RNC and use political donations. Downticket Republican candidates will have to campaign on a shoestring.
But there is a ban on any NYC registered financial institution lending to him for 3 years?  Ah yes you mentioned it at the end..
Because he won’t have to pay a dime
Hopefully he keeps it up, keep catching cases 😂😂
So what you need collateral for a loan to buy tgings or invest not to give away just because he may have enough collateral does not mean he can repay and nobody wants to foreclosure and try to make the clown crook pay. He wouldn not be able to pay the interest let alone the principal
Flag video for misinformation
The 8th Amendment will overturn all of this.
If you say so. Banks don't want to even deal with him anymore. You know, because of the massive fraud. I'm sure he'll be making a deal with one of our enemies that will put our country in even more danger.
I would not think that Donald has that many clear deeds. "The King of debt."?
I got a feeling foreign entities will come to his rescue in particular Russia or Saudi Arabia!!!! Seeing how  the republican circus is very VERY  Russian friendly lately
Haven’t u heard the judge think mar a lago is only 18 million dollars lol
Bs if he had so much money he wouldnt need campaign donors and
I saw an opposition report
Chuckle...hahahahahaha.... You silly fools will believe anything.
Because he’ll be in prison 🤣🤣🤣🤣 VOTE TRUE BLUE ACROSS THE BOARD!!! 💙💙💙🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
None of this will ever stand up in a appeals court this is fascism at its best this is communism New York will pay a big price for this The people in New York will pay a big price for this New York is the future Detroit it'll be called new Detroit City
Who is going to loan him money? Nobody
I'm sure he'll borrow the money from Putin That's Where he got his campaign money 4The 2016Presidential run
Pay your taxes
Oh yeah let's see if banks will let him mortgage any of his properties without Problems
This is AI reporting. 😂😂😂😂
He won't pay anything because the case will be overturned
Cough, cough, bullshist
Your claim that his company possesses 400 million in "liquid assets" is utterly laughable. Did you get that from any statement of financial condition provided by the company??  🤣
One person being that rich(while people in the US go hungry,and have no housing)is sickening.
540 million  of lying  lawyers  and corrupt  of judges   just like my home Georgia  corrupt  lawyers  judges.
We know this to be inaccurate.
Notice the media never says any of this!
Because he doesn't have to pay for a frivolous lawsuit
So why hasn't he paid the bond? Appeal without the bond is ludicrously stupid.
Ain't no way Mar-A-Lago is worth 300 million
Maybe next time he'll think.... Before he cheats....   (He already hasn't)
I tnink he signed over his propertes to his sons... 👍💪💰
Putin will save him.
Palm Beach County appraised Mar-a-Lago between $18 to $30 million, according to evidence presented under oath in the fraud case.  Kinda stark difference from $300 million valuation claimed in this video.
Because his supporters are happy to pay it for him lol plus the sneakers!
Wouldn’t pay a dime, reminds of Lance Armstrong. Everyone was doping, they chose to only disgrace 1. So crooked.
Sounds like a fan 2 me
hilarious, i especially liked how they made it sound like (or worse really think) truth social is an asset!
Yes, I'm sure Forbes will loan trumputin the money.  He's trustworthy and won't default or declare bankruptcy, right???
Well show us the $$ !!!
Problem is, he has no time. All the suit you mention has a process that takes time. More time than he has.
You know if Truth Social ever goes public Trump's stock value is estimated at $4 Billion dollars. Money never mattered. How's that for justice?
Because it’s a shame of a trial and will be overturned on appeal…
Spanky gotta pay up.
He should borrow against his assets? Would these be the same assets that got him convicted for drastically overstating their value in previous loan applications?  That's a bold strategy Cotton, let's see if it pays off for him.
Who would lend money to a convicted rapist facing 91 felonies?
Forbes, are you descendants of the Nazis?
Really duped Americans have been distracted from the Migrant crisis. Usually Scammed Americans 😮
Lmao just wait til he wins the appeal and doesn’t have to pay anything. The left will lose their minds 😂😂
Lousiticia was planning to seize them
The screw ball james won't see a dime because the higher court will laugh it out the door 🤣
If you cant do the time. Dont do the crime...
❤ AMEN...
If the Crazy Orange Lunatic Buffoon Deadbeat can afford it, why didn't he post the Bond with his appeal ? You got to pay up one way or another 😂
WRITE THE CHECK
What a great guy 🤮
So what if he doesn’t take out loans on a or some properties but then they become a let’s say fire magnet or just get torched by a laser beam. ?
SHOW US THE MONEY!
lol Forbes left him off the list
Wahaaaa!😩😢
It will be interesting to  see whether this turns out to be true. Certsinlt differs from most observers. Forbes reputation is on the line..
He owes the IRS just as much as New York, if it came after him!!!
Oh forbes call mara lago 300m? That is literally what the fraud accusations are about. What a joke. The judge said it was only worth 18m hence the "fraud" that the bank itself didnt even have a problem with. You're all pathetic.
Thanks Forbes for your support of Trumps Assets and positive feelings. Now that we know how easy it is for him, his dept should be paid immediately. Average w2 tax payers want him to pay his taxes/ penalties immediately or suffer, as we would.
Vladimir will help his buddy.
Stop peddling bullshi*.He appealed nothing because he didnt put up the matching funds.
NY court system will be its death.
Then how can he pay his debt service  and other payments?
Criminal Democrat Prosecutors and Judges shaking Down a United States 🇺🇸 Citizen like Organized Criminals. How Pathetically Corrupt.
I'll bet money the judge and DA end up in prison when this is all over.
The SEC about a week ago also approved his Truth Social media deal up to $10 billion,gains him about $4 billion.
Sounds like total Bullshit.
I would like to quote our great president in times like these.  "Jowjhsh gjso hshsg yyuhdbd jhf nshsjs js."        - joe biden -
He sold his leases
I do not believe the "mortgage free" part of your story is correct .
China.  The CCP will put up the bond so their agent will continue his good work in America.
Why does he have to borrow if a millionaire oh billionaire?
😅😅😅😅
If thats the case then wouldnt he pony up the cash now to stop the increasing interest?  This isnt complicated, every day the amount he owes increases 140k, so if he has the cash on hand then wouldnt he cut his losses and just pony up to start the appeal and end the increasing debt?  Forbes seek help
He’s not paying
Lain kali dilihat dulu bagaimana kelulusannya sewaktu di universitas.
Sure Jan.
Are you sure he didn’t make up those numbers ? He has a reputation for that 😂
Sure he has $400 million cash. He himself said so, and you can trust him 💯 percent. He has NEVER inflated his worth (or his hand size) 😂😂😂😂
Do not raise 1 Dollar. Ignore corrupt courts. Done.
Nonsense… the disgraced former president will soon be bankrupted, convicted on all criminal counts accused, and incarcerated…
He will not have to sell anything because Leticia James is going to sell his stuff for what it is actually worth.
So why didn’t he post bond immediately?
“He can just write a check” riiiiiight. Then write that check today and show us “lefties” that you’re not lying for once.
If the orange jesus really has a lot of money, why is he letting the interest of $111,000/day keep adding up?
Dont forget the tennis shoe Empire,........HHAAHAJHA!!!
Great. It's good to know he can pay the full amount he owes to everyone. It would have been a shame for him to file bankruptcy or find some other scheme to not pay what he owes.
Put him in jail.
Your appraisals are way too high.His name is Mudd.
This channel is total BS -  definitely not affiliated with the real Forbes magazine!  LMAO
Diaper Don will turn it into $16.4 billion!
Please explain then, Why doesn't/isn't he?!
Forbes 👎 I would question ANYTHING coming from this source.
If Forbes continues to miss inform about Trump,,,I’m unsubscribing at the next pro-liberal Democrat video😂😂😂
People wondering which bank will loan him money because of his "credibility". Go take out a premium credit card. You'll get your answer.
He can borrow money on his name alone.
Posting bond? Not possible?!? Cannot borrow money from anyone in NY.
When will Jared Kushner be subpoenaed for $2B from Saudis?
I did not understand the law why he had to pay since he is appealing the case.
The only bank they would lend to him over the past decade (Deutsche) has been prosecuted by multiple governments for money laundering and assisting in tax evasion. Are these you're best talking points, Forbes? Who are your sources; coffee and toilet paper?
Forbes estimates peoples wealth on fugizzy fugazzy ..
He needs to post a bond. He does not have the cash.
You’re telling us something we already know mate..  the thing is what bank will give him the money because he has zero credibility..  he tells lies and he is a fraud
why would he need to pay? he will appeal this will go away. it's just a circus show!
Forbes overstates the value of it's reporting. Shell out half a billion Forbes you can afford it
Bc bidens gonna bail him out 😂
Why do you insist that he has $400m in liquid assets? That was just a snap shot in time. You are doubling down on your error. Borrowing involves an entity willing to lend. Good luck. If it’s so easy to write a check why didnt it accompany his Notice of Appeal? I disagree with you and time will prove that your organization was wrong once again.
