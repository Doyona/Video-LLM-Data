I’m in third grade in Michigan and I have those same stools
the student: can u check my paper the laptop: am i a joke to you?
I'm in a World History class in middle school and seriously the kids there are too stupid for their own good. I'm genuinely surprised some of them got in.   Our teacher had assigned a project back in September, and still, like nine students per class have not turned anything in. So now, we have a mini project that's due over 2 days and we can't take it home 🙃
We just don't know how to do the work and we just want to have fun
TV TV
I helped this kid write his story and I told him that the instructions where two write 3 paragraphs for reasons (4-6 sentences) and he wrote 1 sentence  So I say to write more on paragraph 2 and he writes more at the end of the page😃
No offense but your eyebrows look fake
The music in the background is disturbing
Sus umug us
The stools ned to be with their family, you don't understand!!!!!
Why is there amongus drawing 🤣
That’s literally me, but I’m a student in fifth grade
><2022<>
we have the same computers at my school!
What grade do you teach
See when the punctuation and capital letters happens it's not because they didn't change anything but because they can't see the issue. They have been staring at it for God knows how long and their brains have said yep that's right where you have a fresh view
Girl what my teacher had the same stools 😱
My students too
That is enough internet for today
Who else sall the             [̲̅A][̲̅m][̲̅o][̲̅u][̲̅n][̲̅g] [̲̅u][̲̅s]
As a student I understand the last one, we do that because we are just lazy 😇😇😇😇
Ha
When you say go check it again where are you getting frustrated outside or head but we can’t take that frustration out on you so we just do one little thing and be like heck it if I get in trouble I get in trouble

I wish I was in your class it would be so much fun🤩🤩
Your so funy
You literally saved my life I have an essay due tonight I finished it a while ago but haven’t turned it in yet thank you so much😂
I remember one time i was told to look at my work. And i did. I looked at it. Then turned it back.  I didnt change anything, because i was told to look at it not to change it. I even thought changing it would be like "hiding my mistakes". I expected to be asked about the mistakes, so i wrote all my mistakes on a separate sheet of paper in case i would be ask which were my errors.  I guess that may be bc im autistic (just discovered i am as an adult) or maybe because i was a very "i do as aim told" person.
This is an odd question but are you in Gwinnett county in Georgia?? You totally don’t have to answer im just curious 😊
Her: "paper" Me:ma'am that's a ipad
I remember in primary school so many kids made grammar, capital letters, and punctuation errors that you weren’t allowed to hand in work without visible edits in red pen, so I had to go over half of my punctuation and letters in red do I could actually turn in my work (this was when we did handwritten stuff)
The among us
Classroom Tour
But who saw the among us 😃👌
That's me
You are two cute 😍
😂😂😂
What grade do you teach🤣
AAA the chromebooks!! So classic
The among us drawings💀
I have that same one at my class
Aniyah:  I have that
For the second one, it's probably cuz they are hoping that you'll do it for them
Used to be a piece of paper that was handed back and forth now it's an electronic brick. Things are devolving.
M                         K
Yeah I do the same thing with my son. Sometimes I don’t understand why he does the things he does also…   Then again think back to our childhood. Did our parents and teachers understand why we did the things we did?
😆
We don’t care
Okay so I did the paper one. My mind would blank as soon as I walked away so I’d just do what i thought they said and go back
I just had my second day of grade 5 and I wish you were my teacher!
I used because twice in a sentence by accident and my English teacher didn't even notice I'm literally better at English than my English teacher who has a degree in like language arts or some shit
Why did we all do this as a kid
I have a question did a student ever fake having a injury
my students do the same
That's my son lol
Damn wish she was my teacher
You know its bad by the way she says “part 24”
Teachers just don’t understand kids minds
Noting like high school lol
Only kids under 10 understand this
Pol
I love the among us papers in the background
I’m in school and 18 mins ago I swallowed a ring :,) I’m in the ER rn-
My teacher has one of those chairs and I fell out of it for no reason😭🤧😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well I do that it is fun and you didn’t say all the paragraph so
These ones I don't get either -
To be fair... I did this many times and was okay with my grade. (when you actually wrote papers lol). I didn't wanna rewrite 3 pages worth of stuff. Usually had a good grade regardless. Not A's ofc lolol
The expression on your face when you realize there’s enough things they do that you don’t get for there to be at least 24 parts…so far.
i love how there's a amongus drawing in the background
No one wants to know about a teachers life
theres amogus drawings in the background
The among us pictures in the background 😂😂😂😂
The last one is me
Mrs wooly mamith
This reminds me of my classmates in 4th grade 💀
Imagine her face when a student finds her channel
Me hey look in the back round  Also me AMOUNGUS
thats called ✨laziness✨
So I was that kid with the paper checking. 😃
Only in public school
The stools were looonelyyyyyy
Lol!
That happed to one of the teachers in my school. The kid didn’t fix it and it was a very big grade eny ho the kid got in a lot of trouble. Idk why bc it was not a big deal.
You have such a good school I wish I was there
It’s the amongus on the wall 😭
The among us papers in the closet 🤣
What year does she teach?
Same but its my classmates then my teachers asked me to help my callsmate lol I was why she whispered that he doesn't listen
I still remember once I finished writing and handed it to my teacher, she looked at it once and said go check it first before giving it to me. But I did many times, I knew there were things wrong but I couldn't understand what it was, it was like looking at a math problem where you just can't solve the answer. So after awhile I gave it back to her and she got so angry she was like you didn't check anything there's a mistake in the first sentence. I was so embarrassed, whenever I needed help I was hesitant to ask because I didn't want to be treated like I was dumb
Way she said part 24 just like my students do a lot of things that I don't understand
Not the fact there was amogos art 💅💅💅👌👌👌
guys you never seen THE AMONGUS DRAWING
2nd one was me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1.we don't like to bend over and take the chairs or stools 2.were just stupid or sometimes we don't see the mistakes
The spongebob background music makes these even more funny
I'm a highschool and still cant punctuate or spell it probably
How do you make these TikToks
Pov ur class finds this
Bro that would be me in 5th and I would always forgot in essay's we had to do

Mr. Woolley middle school English teacher here....100% accurate even up here.

I just watch part 69 and now it is 24
Why your  Student drawing a sus

I love how ur on part 24 of this

Yea I did that last one a couple times before😅
"Oh... You said to LOOK over it. Didn't know you wanted me to correct it, too." 😂
You remind me of my teacher😂
Jokes on her we use auto correct to do our papers
I used to do this when I was little
THOSE DRAWINGS ARE SUS...
Can you tear up the classroom then make your students clean it up
classroom while the students are gone then when the students get to class you make them clean it up
To be fair, you said to check it. You never said to fix it.
Why is it that when a teacher sends a kid back to their desk to fix stuff they go back to the teachers desk a few minutes late and have done nothing to their paper? I always hear my teacher yelling at someone for not doing anyhting lol 😂😂😂
that is the only one that isn't just stupidity as far as my opinion goes
the kids draw among us🤣
Vibing to the music😎
How old are you’re students???
Mrs William but that's the same person why don't you get friends and do it. From
Things that yts do that i dont understand GOING FROM PART 1 TO PART 1 QUADRILLION🤣🤣🤣
The stool thing? That's petty. Fergettaboutit.
I have my moments where I just can't fix my papers and trust me, most of the time, it's as annoying for the students as it is for the teachers.
That's called the stupidity of American kids
The spongebob music ll
As a fellow student I am going to I am going to answer these questions won the very first one we think that we’re cleaning up we are not two the second one some of us just get really lazy so we like to pretend that we just did one sentence
I know why they do this and this is coming from a kid they do it just because
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii iiiiiii iiiiiii iiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Bb bvc
Jjhggbbbbbhg
Show a video of what you do after work at school??!!

0:13 Sus background
Your a really nice teacher. I would LOVE to be in your class.
I love you I'm your biggest fan
O🤣🤣👏👏🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️
I think some students I was one of them because of my social anxiety I was always so worried about being around people people staring at me or me having to talk aloud in a quite classroom I sometimes wouldn’t hear what they asked me to do id remember some of what they would tell me to check and I would miss something so for me it was because my anxiety was always at 100000 like I’d throw up pretty much almost every day before school or just to leave the house it was bad
Chicer noon  wow I love shit but this is funky so whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
If me or any of my classmates did this, we would have been sent to the principals office.

Isn’t that what we pay you for right
THE AMONG US DRAWING IN THE BACKGROUND

Y'all are allowed to have laptops in school????
Just like my class in school!🤣
I used to do that same thing with punctuation and spelling and I didn't have the understanding to tell my teachers that I needed help. I probably didn't fix anything because I didn't know how. My teachers also apparently didn't have that understanding.
Have the same like chairs and same table and the colored circles
Mrs. Woolley we actually
“It’s not a mistake ✨it’s a masterpiece ✨
Ok
This vid shouldn't be just about yur students..  should be this generation... I don't understand half the vids I see... its like why da f would u do that lol...

She puts on more makeup as the series goes on, you can slowly see the epithelium dissapearing

God bless
We have those stools at our school at BELLFOUNTE
I myself don’t understand this especially the correction part because it would bug me if it was not corrected. I try to get straight As and if I don’t I am super hard on myself and idk why.
Love you smile Keep up the vids
Yea u seem like one of those. Have a good day Ms. Karen.
Is it just me or does anyone else not make any revisions to their essay I just send that shit right in
i have the same stools and table with the circle things on them in my math class
As a high schooler I can say that I have done at least three of these
The life of a loser some one who has gotta be alone forever
I feel like she might be a b****
That face she made at the wnd of the intro is a whole mood.
Wait are u a 5th grade teacher 😀 be my teacher
My teacher has the same stools as you
OMG YOUR A HOTTTT TEACHER I WISH I WAS UN SCHOOL WITH YOU
I’m in 6th grade reach where I do 8th grade stuff and in my language class they always say to put correct punctuation but I was never taught where to put commas and stuff I know where to put periods and question marks and exclamation points but I was never taught where to put commas and other punctuation
I remember a pretty hilarious time relating to checking punctuation when I was in year 1 (about 5 or 6 years old). One of my friends had written a paragraph but not used any full stops, and was told to add full stops, so he added them all in at random points in the sentence, not really understanding what they were for, just what they looked like. He ended up with "parrot." as a sentence at the end of the paragraph with the previous sentence ending in "the." This isn't to make fun of him, I just think it's a rather cute thing for a 6yo to do. The teacher was frustrated tho. I blame her for not properly teaching him how full stops worked.
"look at my paper" **Hands over laptop  Boy how the times have changed since i was a kid.
Things teachers do i just dont get
No offense but if your students have a hard time following instructions you give them, you're probably a shit teacher
Did someone draw you a sus-
If you dont get basic children behaviour then you may not be fit for this job
Why are there so many more attractive teachers now!?! Bullshit!
If I'm in your class I'm going to be high as shit and do all the work quietly because that's how I do my work in every school day 420 of life
Please fix them when they try to do the thing where they fix the specific example you gave them but don't generalize the concept and apply it across the work.  Those people turn into very annoying adults to work with.
It's not a mistake ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
That is why I could never be a teacher with the corrections I would have said “ YOU BIG DUMMY”
Horrible teacher putting down kids. What a looser chick
Is it sad that I've done those things🙄🤣
Because they have had you Karen's for teachers for too long
Wait I'm confused you have laptops but your classroom looks like it's for 8 or 9 year olds
They are children!
I would wife you up in a heartbeat💓
Ok if the round stools aren't gonna match the circles on the table I would probably fix that daily
Every kid is different in there ways do you not see that that's sad if you dont
So glad my kids teacher isn’t a tik tok hoe
Maybe if you were teaching instead of tiktoking and mocking them lol public schools are a joke
I’m about to go into 5th grade and I just want to know if it’s hard
I need her as my teacher haha
Oh goodness. Please don't work in NY. 😢
ok the second one would be me. i used to edit peoples stories in my classes and i don’t anymore because i am traumatized by the obvious mistakes, spelling, and horrible writing in general. i of course would never tell them this because i don’t have it in my heart to do so i would just fix things without them paying attention. if i ever did tell them to fix sometimes on their own they’d change one thing or be offended :/
The background music: 🎶🎵 Me: 💃
This is dumb
😂
This was the first one I have ever watched and for being the first it is one of my favorite
man I wished my teachers looked like dis😂
Ngl I did all these thing when I was in school
Ms Wooley is smoking!!
They honestly don't really care
Do they do your makeup as well?
Dang she sexy I don't think I would get any work done in her class🤷
Not very interesting
Yeah school sucks, and teachers are not good enough to teach 30 kids at a time.
That among us ඩා drawing in the back 🤣🤣
None of my teachers were ever this cute
12 years ago I'd get my phone taken away for looking at it on school property. Now teachers are making Tiktoks 🤦‍♂️ we're in a massive decline
How old were you when you had your first child
The fricking among us pictures
God we get it already, it's insufferable, your a teacher, thankyou .
All I get from all these tictoks is the teachers are not giving all the time to the students they’re giving it for likes
Does she have a bacon shirt on
I dont like school i have hated school evry day so flip of skools and teachers
Stupid high school kids
Shes adorable
You should meet up with Mrs. Rogers and do a collaboration.
Bruh I was the last kid 😂💀
I wish I would teach you that damn pretty You are gorgeous
Wish she was my teacher she’s gorgeous
I've seen 30 year old people do this
How to troll teachers xD
I teach senior English and my students don't EVER fix all of the corrections I suggest.
There's ONLY one 'Mrs R.Rodgers'.  Be more creative dnt just copypaste her.
Why are you wearing fake eyelashes to work at a school around children?????
Get off the internet and teach kids
Now I am 14 and In special needs and I have 1 question what's a paragraph.
I know someone is going to go off on me like I'm making a some big deal here, but why are they even called "a paper" anymore when everything is done on school laptops these days? They don't even print out the reports to turn them in, but just sent them to the teachers Dropbox. I'm not arguing for the return of physical paper reports, I'm asking why they are still referred to as "papers"
At least you say where to fix it ulike my teacher that just says go back and fix things when i jave no clue what to fix
Things that women do that I just don't get. Square off your eyebrows as if it looks natural.
A student never fails  The teacher does !!
This is funny but the last one sounds like she might be calling out a few peoole
Should be called "reasons I bang my teachers". When I was in school they were all old and mean women
Kids are stupid af.
Last one was definitely me
The last one I done alot too 😅
Things my teachers do that I just don’t get. Go out and drink on the fire escapes between classes   Bang students
Why didnt i have you as a teacher you’re beautiful
We don’t get why you want us to redo everything like tf no
Yea that last one is forgivable and not weird at all. These are kids btw
She's pretty 😍😍
I'm in college and in still the last kid
That is exactly how my son thinks. Makes me wonder wtf is going on in his head.  Am I doing something wrong? Lol
Your making fun of kids really? Lol
You know what crazy is I see adults do these same things
She kinda seems karen
God sent his on and only son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins! He took the punishment for you so you wouldn’t have to go to hell. Repent of your sins today and turn to God, repeat after me, “Heavenly father, I open up my heart to you today and I ask believe that you sent your one and only son to die on the cross for me. I ask that you forgive of my sins for I turn away from my sins and turn to you, in Jesus’ name I pray amen!”
As a teacher myself I can definitely relate to this video.
The kid I work with does this everyday I tell him to fix alittle things but he just doesn't want to do it
They probably need a good teacher
Lol how am I supposed to know that third paragraph had multiple erros and not just on that one sentence that I corrected
I laughed so hard at the “can u check my paper” *hands over laptop*
If you don't like your job..find another one..Thus is just annoying that you would complain about a profession you chose...
Lets all be real here for a second .........          SHE IS SEXY ASF
Whoever you are, are you single
Probably shouldn't be allowed to have anymore students if youre up to part 24 lol
School vouchers are a must
Carrott
Why do kids that small have a laptop.
She's got some beautiful eyes
Where tf were all these pretty teachers when I was a kid
I can help you with understanding these.  Just like us adults, kids are also lazy and don’t like putting effort into things
Those stools can go to hell.
Meanwhile she's probably teaching them that black lives matter and LGBTQ+@%&$4 is God.
Was this garbage supposed to be funny?
i wish she was my teacher🤩
Yall don't use paper no more?
Stools = wall bricks. DONT brainwash them further than already "have to be" by the "govern"ment.
Future teacher who wonders why they got fired
What the fuck is tjis
"Did you actually fix anything" logical interpretation and reasoning > you need teach them it they clearly don't understand it
Sounds like they have a bad teacher
When I was a kid the second incident happened To me quite often lol
You don’t get that last one? Dumb teacher
The among us drawings in the background 😂😂😂
In my defence i stupid
Try hitting them! I’ve had great results! 👍 #PayItForward
Shes gorgeous 😍, me and my wife who's bisexual wish we could meet someone special like her🌹😇🌹.
Yup. We're dead.
Actually in reality it would be better to put the stools off to the side instead of under the desk so the custodians can come in and a sweep that tile and don’t have to move the stools and put them back. Or if they are lazy they would just not sweep that spot because there is a chair there.
Sometimes they won't get things that actually require any effort?
It’s ironic that a teacher wonders y kids are dumb
Because children are stupid. Everyone knows this.
Humans are really dumb
Amogus
Teachers doing fuck all as per usual why marking this crap
Suddenly I’m hearing “Hot for Teacher” by Van Halen in my head.
Whenever students need to fix punctuation or grammar issues on a computer and it's like an essay length paper, it helps to highlight the areas to fix and to be explicit about what to fix to make it easier to work with. I wish I could have said this to most of my teachers but atleast I still managed to become a senior
I have dyslexia and being made to go back to check your work countless time when you don't understand what you are looking for hurts
Well u need to think like a student, none of them want to be there, their condition for leaving is showing effort and the clock hitting whatever time the lesson ends, so theyre going to go and get what they want, which is to leave, so they dont care where ur uncomfortable stools go at the end of the lesson because they can no longer feel their arses after being sat on them for an hour, and theyre going to ask u to check because it notifies u that they have tried despite their shit work, which means ull let them leave at the end of the lesson. It always makes sense, ur just looking at it from an adult at work who wants a payrise, could quit at any time and get a new job and wants to go home at the end of the day, vs a child who can switch school, and do the exact same thing because they are forced into education, and want to go home, and the smart ones who do want some grades (thats two conditions, not saying the smart ones want grades), they know they can get them easier at home because everything is on the internet and they can spend the correct amount of time on a topic for them personally. So 95 percent of ur class doesnt want to be there.
Part 25....stare at that a$$
Jesus Christ love you
I was the person with the punctuation I just never know when to end a sentence
You are to cute to be a teacher. I wouldn't be able to learn at all.
The among us drawings in the back XD
So you don't get... Children?
Maybe get off social media and do ya job maybe ya kids would know how to fix their work... idk I guess poking fun at your students will make them smarter too
If only they had a teacher to help them and explain things out more instead of expecting them to know
That last one gets me.
Bruh if you don’t get it it’s because there clearly little kids🤦🏼‍♂️
HEY TEACHERS, LEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE 🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵
What grade do you teach
It’s still considered a “paper” when its all done on a laptop,
It's almost like they dont give a shit. It's almost like they're kids.
Can y’all imagine how mad we would’ve been if our teachers posted this about us
Wow
Yeah I do the second one about every time that happens
This could destroy some kids if they saw their teacher posting shit like this
Ummm they have the smallest growing brain.... Stop being hard on them. Especially in social media. They can access this video and really fall behind knowing they are not up to the mark.
When I was in school and they told me to fix the papers I would do the same thing because it’s too much to do when I just wrote a paragraph about a book at that point my Brain hurts
Among us
What grade do you teach
Can you be my teacher 🤔
Goddamn that filter hahahahaha
They are kids dumb dumb they are bound to make some mistakes
Uhh teach them..
These shorts never fail to entertain me.
Deal with it
This is what happens when kid's eat to much fast food, drink city water and are allowed to much internet access.  They get dumber shorter and fatter.
Her eyes are amazing. I don’t get how teachers do what they do I mean I was a horrible student
Comparing to russian school this looks like kindergarten!
I get it...its called lazy!
All these “these shorts make my day” comments feel fake asf ..
Baddie
Man my teachers looked, sounded and behaved like Peter Parker getting into a car crash after his 4773rd leukemia treatment.
Why are you making 5th graders write papers, that’s the real question
You skipped 22 also I can relate to some of these
Your just a bad teacher hopefully your not a mom
I get it lol..
I'm a university teacher and it's so fun to grill students during the final check for their thesis draft with me, the second supervisor, before sending it to be checked by the first supervisor.  It's not just fun for me. I'm educating future lawyers and they're fucked if they can't put punctuations on the right place. The difference could be life and death, profit and bankruptcy.  But it's still fun tho 😂
Yo Mrs. Woolley I still don’t understand the homework task you gave us last Friday
Man I wish she was my teacher 😂
😆 them eyebrows man
To easy
Why was you not my teacher
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHHAHAAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
When I was in highschool I hated when teachers would say paragraph whatever , I'd do my best and not understand one bit hence why I'm having a teacher check my work , school sucked haha , teachers would never actually help
Thier parents feed them food and don't give them education, moral
If you’re Telling a kid he has to go back and re punctuate stuff and getting annoyed when you send him off to do it and he comes back with the same paper you’re not a good teacher that’s a good opportunity to sit down with him and teach him
Maybe you suck at teaching
😐😐😐😐
Teaching is repeating, so, brace yourself, there a LOT more to come XD
These shorts never fail to impress me. I can scroll so long
Glad my teachers didn’t have the ability to roast me and my peers on social media everyday after work. Someone needs to tell the women this shit ain’t cool. Ruining kids self esteem everyday
These shorts are so entertaining they always make my day better💕
So kids act like kids..
as a nighttime custodian why don’t you push them back if you notice this ?
Pt 24 of why did u choose to work with kids
Things I'd do, part 24.
Now the kids have back problems because they are sitting on those uncomfortable stools all day
Ayo
Praise God for teachers like you 🙂
I deserve detention miss!
Do they use laptops like really or just this video?
Yup this is why I have insecurities towards teachers now a days.
Mrs. Woolly do you use a crayon marker for your eyebrows?
They’re kids not nazis
....and this why I retired as a public school educator
i dont ned No Correkt. punctuation and Capitalization, TEACHER
Honestly the fixing the paper bit sounds like something I done in high school.🤣
What’s this teachers tik tok
Listen if I'm told to fix punctuation, I'm just going to turn it in
Our society is fucked lol we just hiring anyone
Omg a saw at the store
Me: writes on the board Me: write this part Students: ok 1 minute passes Students: so... Should we write or...?
This is a lie, she actually beats them with a stick
That’s right publicly shame your students and by the looks of the classroom it’s not even a middle school or high school but go ahead with your proud teacher self
A monkey😳suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuus
The  pupil is also  like that.!!!!!
The among us in the background
Pretty teacher.
Those silly kids.
Do you realize kids are new growing evolving humans?
I’m in 5th grade and I know kids who do that
we have those same stools in the lab at the elementary school i help at
Again, She just doesn't get her students 😕
What grade is ur students?
I have a teacher named mrs.loyld lol I'm a 8th grader
Lol
Aren’t you the teacher lol? Supposed to help with their work
yeah like i think such students are only from the us
I love the soundtrack in the background Lmao
did anyone notice that there was a purple among us carecter in the back or is it just me
Why is no one talking about her shirt that makes her look like she just drank like 1 litre of blood?
Your eyebrows are too squared out in the front.
Ok so if this is in America I can tell you the reasons behind all of these 1 we just want to cause chaos and make ppl fall 2 bc we are lazy beyond belief and 3 we just generally forget
AMONG US?!?
I love your videos like so much
😮 my music teacher has those stools!!!
What grader do you teach
Why do you have among us drawings
"miss, can you check my paper?"  *Brings a laptop*
Why is this so true 😭 (there is this one boy named Leonard he always does that)
Lol 😂 i am in 5th grade to hopefully you can be my teacher someday
Comment 601
Hi

I saw among us that's sus
Jesus Christ loves you
Yoyt or hoyt
Yeah we check it add something maybe and that's it
I feel this is teenagers too. I've training 16 year olds at my job. And it like their listening but their not. Like they hear part of it but not the rest. Then just do whatever.

The among us pictures in the background are the tea to top it off-

Dxvdgf
Bruh if I had to sit on stools like that all day I’d have scoliosis by age 6💀🤚
They’re called children that’s what you signed up for!?
Definitely didn’t scroll through every one of her vids 👀
What school do you work at
Why she look like my middle school PE Teacher aaah
Well sometimes teachers dont give us enough information on what we should fix so we get confused and sometimes we cant be bothered to do too much work
The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
What grade do u teach
Am I school those kids are devious they unscrewed those chairs that you have
The first one you mentioned it's because students get confused by other students misplacing the chair somewhere else and when they came back the chair was somewhere else so they got confused.
Whyy teachers
Okay so here's the thing I'm going to swing everything that we do to you so you can understand we're putting them over there cuz we could just take them over while like I said before I content to your other video we have our own certain way of the organization we we don't have the that we just go with it and with the punctuation we just we're just sitting there just thinking like where we going to do you spect us to ride a hunter paragraph with fire puny little brain trying to spell out the with one keyboard do it in space equally asking us to destroy the longest story and insisted to break the hunter world record everything break the world record of everything that ever existed you expect some I pre cares kindergarteners first graders when they could barely even spell the and make before I commented on your other video out know if you saw it but you would steal a better answer than I did not see the exact answer that I put in but so yeah. And yes I ball that one s.
Things I don’t understand Pt.25: Your eyebrow
Probably because they don't really care
Your so funny I love your videos
among us drawings at the back:
Did anyone notice the purple among us guy
That ebcuase sometimes they don't know or they just don't want too
Everytime I watch one of your videos, it reminds me of my friend who goes around barking at people. My teacher nor my classmates know why he does it, but it's become such a regular occurrence that if he doesn't we get concerned
You have wird students lol
Lol 😂
Among us in the background
I'm so lucky I live in Britain cuz I just got 35 percent

From a guy who has dyslexia and was undiagnosed through all of elementary school and part of middle school until my lawyer forced the schools to test me. But that last part can be confusing, you never know that to them it looks right when to you, a “normal person”, looks wrong.

The sadness in her voice when she says put 24 you can tell that girl is stressed out
When I sit in the cafeteria I sit alone in a 2 person table and most of the time other students ask me to take the chair that I'm not sitting on. Well it's not like I ever sit with someone, besides I'm apparently looking unfriendless
BRO WHY IS THERE A AMONG US DRAWING BEHIND HER
You look like if my aunt, and mom, somehow had a baby...
Now,  I don't even do one sentence...

respect to the kid who drew an among us character
You look like Demi Lovato! anyone else?
I actually do that like I don't understand where the corrections and punctuations are so I either just spend time just looking at it or I just do one part and then the rest I don't do even when I'm 13 the teachers expects my iq to be smarter🙃
We just waste time we ain't no correcting anything we talk with other and goofing around
Idk but the pictures in the background are kinda...    SUS
You really look like miakal  actor 'actor'
"These shorts make my day😇"
Things my teacher do and I just don't get 😊
That’s a computer not a paper
Lol 😂🤣
Another definition for my daily life in school:)
The last one is because you don't specifically say on what 1 sentence or the entire paragraph
The fact that you ACTUALLY HAVE A CLASSROOM and dont photoshop with a green screen
Among us is in the backaround
Just to say next time tell them to redo the WHOLE PARAGRAPH and not just telling them to fix somthing without them knowing what to Fix btw (and pls dont take this as a harsh saying...)
Omg among us poster in the background

The among us in the back round lol
Sometimes I’ll forget teachers can be that young and pretty because all of my teachers are mean old men
As a student, (not hate, just trying to give her some tips 🙂)  1. it's hard for us students to understand the command/request  if it isn't specific.  2. Just because we are thought about everything for that topic,  that doesn't mean we learned it all.  Students study many subjects, which makes them forget about something in from a class, unlike teachers they teach for one subject.  3. Students will cooperate more if you let them do what they want, but only if they are done with the activity. This will make them cooperate more because they are most likely to be excited to do what they want. 4. Punish them for REASONABLE reasons. I don't know if u r the type to get mad at students for no reason but I've seen tons of teachers that are like that.  5. Remind them of late assignments. I know that our assignments r our responsibility but we usually forget about them because they r replaced with new memories.  6. Give them game activities or something like that to build more relationship with the students. It would be better if the game is quite related to the subject, (this technique is usually for math but it does work for other subjects like science) this will also help release energy which makes them less active during lessons.   I'm just sharing this because this is what my old school is like. My aunts school is also like this (she was in college). All of the students in the schools got closer because of school activities.
My teacher has those same stool’s and I in 5th grade🤣
Man that chair throw was smooth
What the
This reminds me of a time where we were doing computing in school        I put my school username and password And then....       The screen was literally sideways  My friends started laughing so hard and the teacher fixed it     Best computing lesson ever

*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Gorgeous  teacher
While I do see the humor here, I hope you understand this video highlights something about you as well. The fact that you title the video as "Things My Students Do That I Just Don’t Get" when referencing the skills or work ethic of your students, it highlights your weaknesses as a teacher. What I mean is, you have to remember where your skill level is compared to theirs, and what it was like to be a child. I guarantee most of your students have lost interest in your lesson plan within the first five minutes, and started thinking about other things. So yes, they will need you explain the same concepts multiple times over. If books were the only tools children needed to learn, you would not be paid to teach them.
The last one was just them being dumb  He needs to learn
Me: looks in the background. The background: AMOG US 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
wait that class look like my class room
Maybe you aren't explaining it well enough. 🤷‍♂️

She always seems to be complaining. Enjoy the job you ungrateful woman, most teachers get on with it and enjoy it. Anything for attention...
Some times my teacher screws up not me because I will ask her to proof read my work and she will say it is fine and turn it in but when I turn it in sshe marks down like 10 things.
How oold are they tho?
Am I the only person who does not get this. When I was in kindergarten my mom was struggling with lesson plans. I did all of them for about the whole year. Yes a kindergartener did a teacher’s with a bachelors degree in teaching  lesson plans. She still gives them to this day to new teachers. I have taught over 100 kids and I was just a kindergartener.  *Proof younger kids are smarter than you think*
Hi

I do hope your students aren’t forced to wear those filthy, wet rags on faces for eight hours a day.

How are you staying calm with all that kids?
Can you check my paper **hands computer**     **VISIBLE CONFUSION**
What grade are you teaching?
Your hair is so long
If you were a kid you would know
1st off 3 PARAGRAPHS?! HUH?! stool: some students think of one thing and think that it looks better this way than the original. And they think that their doing you a favor they really aren't though Work: sometimes we think you mean on thing but you ment a nother thing
My favorite response was when I sent a kid back to their desk to check their work and they came back with nothing changed and said “I checked it, it’s good”.😂🤦‍
I'm in 8th grade and I can confirm that I have done this when I was in elementary
