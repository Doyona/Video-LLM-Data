Please let us get one more update
this event doesnt exist.
Horrible movie but fun game
MHW: speaks english the entire time MHW x MH movie character enters: speaks MH language
Revolver Ocelot "Revolver Ocelot"
.
Any1 tell me how can i get to play as her
low IQ MHW fans
Movie was absolute dog shit
The worst movie video game adaption of all, should just let Japan movie makers make it if you want good and better movie based video games LOL
What a horrible looking movie.
All I'm waiting for is someone to extract her model and that's getting inserted into RE2 or 3 remake
Yea...  Why would I wanna play as him when my CAC can have better feats?
ah yes because she needs to be the main character not us. just like jill and the rest of the resident evil characters didn't need to be the main characters either in the movies. no. just no.
Tony Jaar pls capcom!!!!!
Hopefully the next update allows us to change Handlers (just finished killing Barioth, I regret not spending more time with the Serious Handler)  In the meantime, if you want to enjoy her for a bit more, DON'T do the Barioth quest
This might be a stupid question... But why isn't there a Monster Hunter World x Godzilla? They're both Japanese, they're both massively successful and they're both about Monsters.  And Imagine fighing the likes of Mothra or Ghidorah, yes please! :D
A lot of comments about monster Hunter collaborating with monster Hunter. Well, you see... The difference is, the game is good.
Agghhhhh
That's dope love this game and ole girl Jovovich. China can suck a turd getting all butt hurt 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why Capcom? Why woul you do this??? Why don't just make an animated movie like RE and make it right!?!?!? FFS
Did capcom really think Paul w.s "I ruin video game movies for a living" Anderson was going to make something worth crossing over into the game? Tbh I just feel bad for Mila Jovovich who keeps getting type cast as bland hero girls.
I feel like gore magala will be in monster hunter iceborne
Wow they put alice from re to monster hunter  -resident evil live action watcher probably
You guys keep talking about how the plot of the movie is bad but don't for one second tell me your headass plays mh for the story the reason were all here  is because pointy stick go shing shing
what a crossover to perfectly illustrate my issues with World, generic-looking weapons and armor, throw in the movie character in some of the most generic fantasy armor with the most generic looking dual blades, and let's make sure she's got a potato for a face as well!  real top-notch capcom, it looks like a parody of itself.
Damn but y'all ever gonna fix the constant disconnect issues on PC?
I don't blame Capcom for doing this collab, but I'm not watching that movie and I'm not playing as the actress from it either.
I was surprised the movie is coming out in theatres this Friday. I hope I can see it. This was unexpected for me.
Everyone is making fun of the trailer of the movie. But I have high hopes. With how highly the Monster Hunter team is speaking of it, I have my hope that it'll actually be pretty decent. Unless Capcom is getting a cut from the movie then nvm. But, they seem genuinely excited for us to see the movie.  Or maybe I'm just praying we don't have another Death Note Netflix adaptation but this time on my childhood.
No thank you.
Highly recommend playing these Events, tbh. The cutscenes with Artemis are dumb, but still more engaging than any of the base game and Iceborne scenes. The fight against World Eater Rathalos is fucking dope and the Artemis armor is OP and can be mixed. The layered armor can also be mixed.
well people it was a pleasure to play iceborne with you all, see you in Rise.
F
Dear hollywood, you can in fact start a movie in a very different universe instead of having isekai stuff and world invasions and very frequently if you put in effort it works.   I hope this doesn't make capcom execs never try a movie with any western studio again because some might actually be ""bold"" if pushed and are legitimately good.
I think its time to add something really fresh to mhw iceborne, and I know what it is: 2 new weapon types and a new Land and of course a bunch of new/old monsters. Then it will finish till the next monster hunter
ah yes yes monster hunter x monster hunter how did i not see this coming
fome la wea
Man, look at those knees...
Her monologue during gameplay is kinda cringe.
There's no way for me to unsee this. Looks cool tho 👍
At last! The last time I used Milla was in The Fifth Element for PS1 xD
Monster Hunter movie is basically an Isekai
Milla Jovovich finally joins CAPCOM!
Don't support racism! Ban!
I'm just gonna pass on this skin and movie, I heard it's bombing bad in China
Great now give us white fatalis
Finished both quests in less than 20 min total let down. I guess it's a fair portrayal of the movie?
Worst collab ever...
Biggest cringe fest of an event... just a chick trying to hard to be tough. Would have been better if we could've played with Tony Jaa
we have to own iceborne ?
It doesn't have BGM 「Proof of a Hero 」 その中にBGM「英雄の証」はありません 裡面沒有BGM「英雄之證」
Come on! JUST PUT GORE MAGALA IN THE GAME ALREADY!

Capcom directly promoting the Live Action movie adaptation of their game
Yo you know how in the movie gore Magala is in their What if for the cross we play as her and we fight gore Magala
Give us gore magala
When Monster Hunter collaborates with Monster Hunter: *Confused Fatalis face*
So she’s the new Queen of Capcom?
iIf Monster Hunter x DOOM ?
Is this that HunterXHunter anime????
Another reason to not return to monster hunter.
Monster hunter collaborating with worst Monster hunter....
"The movie might be trash but at least it won't affect the game" they said...
I'm new. I just downloaded the game. How do I get Milla Jovovich?
Okay *NOW* can I go back to saying World was a mistake? Because we didn't have this sort of shit happening beforehand.
Movie? 45 sec
So... no arch tempered shara ishvalda... wow they love to listen am I right...  I really feel like they are shoving the movie down our throats and I really don’t wanna see it now (in my opinion of course if you want to its fine by me)
This makes me a little bit sad, probably the last significant update to the game and its for this.
Off topic does anyone want endemic life in rise
Will Artemis be a permanent character you can use or limited time?
so much for the final update
Is it too late to pull a Sonic on this movie? lol
No
No! Gawd! No! Gawd! Please, no! No No No! Nooooooooo!
....frankly i’d rather they just didn’t add any new content at all for once
Its bullshit
Yo 🐶 I heard you like Monster hunter so we put Monster hunter  in monster hunter so you can play monster hunter while you play monster hunter
The movie its rallye bad capcom why omg why did you need that do you want kill your license ? 😭😭😭😭
I'm so happy the RE movies ended so Alice can stay there as the character she isn't
MHW you brought BEHEMOTH in here so...WHATS STOPPING YOU FROM BRINGING BAHAMUT TOO?!! IFRIT?!! LEVIATHAN?!! COME ON MAN!! BRING THEM HERE ALREADY SO WE CAN HUNT THEM!!!
I'm a dual wield user and I don't even want this. Look at her weapons, dude. Kinda disgraceful ngl.
I just have to point out the irony of Milla Jovovich actually appearing in a Capcom game and it’s not Resident Evil hahah
Alice in Monster Hunter world?
I swear to God if they don't put gore magala in this quest😡😡😡
Wtf is this 😂😂😂
update or dlc either way im excited
Too bad the movie will suck
Does this collabs comes with non-lore-friendly humbees? and machineguns with unlimited ammo? and grenades and explosives? aside from the crappy actress i mean.
I hope her Armor set is bad so i don't have to use her
“And look where it brought you, back to me...”
Noooo!! Y'd she have to use dual blades, it's not as op as LS. Maybe she know helm Braker is broken.
I miss anime collab :c
Where dafuq is Tony Jaa?
Monster hunter+Monster hunter=Milla Monster hunter Jovovich
This gonna be very amazing dashing  Turn me also like it into reality.... 💞💓💞💗
No?but seriously no
what?
big power move
where is gore magala  and  nerscylla
That doesn't look like her, that is her stunt double
Rather have Tomb Raider crossover with Lara Croft
I hope they add a glock
watch the collav be 95% better than the movie
Lemme guess. This quest will give you the option to unlock the layered armour, normal armour and dual blades. That’s it. Zzz
I love monster hunter, but I hate the movie thats gonna come out
Why am I having a deja vu feeling from DRAGON BALL EVOLUTION on MH movie ugh I don't like these!!
other arch tempered elders for a final difficult challenge??  nah fam fuck that, guess we're getting a crossover with the live action movie everyone is trying to forget about
just her being in a movie makes me think its gonna ruin the good original material and her hubby being so loved to showcase his wife gonna makes it worse
Noice!
finally  mila jovovich 3d model for 3d sfm porn
私はアリス
Well at least the palico that who carries incapacitated will get to rest, hoping there is US military jeep XD
This is the most ambicious crossover of all time
Its Canon now.
pengen main anjg tapi gaada duet
"(Monster Hunter language)"  Me: *Aight*
Steel Battalion Capcom  2020 -----> 2082 War
Monster hunter collab with capcom HOW?!!
Yo dawg I heard you like MH so we collaborated with MH for you.
Why this movie exists?
Too bad Milla and her husband are pretty sketch
This 46 second video is probably still going to better than the actual multi-million dollar feature length movie.
Sweet Home Alabama
Damn this is cringe
Bruh
YOU SAID LAST UPDATE ABOUT FATALIS!!! YOU BETTER STOP!!! OR ANNOUNCE THAT YOURE DOING ANOTHER YEAR OF MHW!!! BECAUSE IVE STEPPED AWAY FROM THE GAME. I thought it was over. DONT PLAY WITH MY FEELINGS CAPCOM! JUST TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL!!!
Not sure how I feel about this....its makes sense but is also shameless advertisement. But on the bright side we will get a heavy bow gun that's a machine gun XD
Where Tony Ja
Wow that's my birthday date...... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I mean... YAY because we got a surprise update which means maybe we’ll get another small one down the road (besides the December one). But Come on guys
When you're a goddamn good franchise you just hafta collaborate with yourself.
"monster hunter language"
I'm still not sure what to think about all this.....
I can understand it the monster hunter movie but it a bad move honestly I would prefer a cross over with godzilla
When movie characters meet their own origin. Time for a rude awakening.🤣  I'll give the movie a watch just for fun.
I can’t wait for this set
Jesus fucking christ, literally nobody asked for this
Where is Tony Ja
Why are people whining so much? The movie hasn’t been out yet.
I saw this coming but still nice, also new trailer they released really makes me want to go see it as it seems to be more focused on the mh world.
Where is new monster
Is anyone actually excited for this?
There a movie?!
I could have sworn to see the various styles of Monster Hunter Generation again, but apparently I am deluded, another reason not to re-download the game despite having already bought and abandoned it in the library ....
I love monster hunter I've been playing it for 12 years now and now this!
Can the next collab be MH4? Like crimson and white fatalis? Ya know? Content thats worthwhile
I want Tony jaa
Hi I want the attack jewel +4 I don't need the ear shit
Capcom please stop this..... Please look at what they did to Resident Evil!
Waiting for mhw x mh rise?
Drake featuring Drake vibes lol
I've never been so excited to skip an event.
Alice is in? Let me get my wallet.
so here is this 1(!) good thing about the movie
There better be a machine gun weapon type now and a sniper where you have to close your left eye while you look with your left eye to aim.
Tony Jaa?
Keep this stuff out of the game, I don't want to smell the soulless stink
haha interesting, and right after everyone tells they're done adding stuff to the game. I really hope they add arch tempered versions of the rest of the elders.
she never ages...
Ready for 8 movies with doubtful history?
Kskssksk  vai da um soco no monstro ala
Is this a threat?
trash. they really do not make good  movies and games these days anymore.
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
Ok but this actually slaps lmao
This smells like toxicity
I guess this is cool, I just wish the movie looked better story wise
But like... why?... you know very few people are actually excited for a Paul Anderson movie and the entire thing is a cash write off that will just make people retroactively like Monster Hunter less just like it did for RE. It took time and good will building for love to come back. And nostalgia.
Waiting for Gore Magala in Iceborne
Lame.
Sad news Capcom.  This is the WORST collab you could do.  You picked the WORST director to make the film, with the WORST reputation for making films terrible, and ALWAYS putting his own wife in said films.  You didn't have to do this AT ALL.  I'm just gonna boycott this particular set of  missions as it brings absolutely NOTHING to the game.
How about no
Please give us a Shrieking Legiana event with large gold crown!! Its the only one left for me and I have done the Hoarfrost Reach 5 monsters event quest like 50 times, probably more, every other monster gets large or tiny except S. Legiana, is this some kind of joke >.<
sooo.. will it there be assault rifle and RPG?
It’s still not too late to make a movie about actual Monster Hunter rather than an isekai no one wants.  If the Sonic movie could make the change, so can you.
I am *baffled* that Capcom themselves screwed up the Diablos' roar...
Can we not give anymore attention to a travesty?
cool but not for me :)
Wow they FINALLY put a Resident Evil character in this!
Just like the movie trailer, will Milla's armor come with earplugs 5 by default?
So the milla Jovovich and her husband Paul Anderson who butchered a beloved franchise from capcom already (resident evil) were given another beloved capcom franchise to destroy well yeah makes sense.... next they'll ruin megaman with milla Jovovich getting megamans armor through a dimensional portal from the military cant wait
Could this mean were getting Gore Magala?
Yeah, if milla is in the movie, we all know it will be shit
What bullshit!!!!! The movie already sucks and THEY STILL SUPPORT IT LIKE YEAH WHITE FATALIS WOULD BE COOL BUT INSTEAD TROLLIN WITH THAT BULLSHIT
Don’t mean to be disrespectful of literally the best game of all time but let’s be honest with ourselves this is a collab that nobody asked for with a movie nobody asked for
F
Booo 👎👎👎
Milla Jovovich slayyyyyyyyyy
Can I have that m249 as HBG🤪
All I hope is that they add Gore Magala as a flex after saying Fatalis was the last update.
WHOA
But no Tony Jaa?
It just never end...... I suggestions just make MHW 2 already capcom no need MH rise.
what a update wtf and i am  :D
give me white fatalist
จ่าพนมกูหายไปไหนละเนี่ย
Time to get in my dual blades practice
💩 get your military crap out of the Movie, Maybe we can Talk then.. the Trailer disgusted me. And Mila jovovich? Really? Sex and war sells i guess huh? Im dissappointed
“Yo dawg, I heard you like Monster Hunter, so we put Monster Hunter IN Monster Hunter!”   - Xzibit
Can we have the handler in the movie too?
They run out of ideas for an event. So they decided to collab on their own franchise. Lol!
Honestly would’ve preferred a tony jaa skin, this is as lame as the movie and anything the director has done with any of Capcom’s ip’s. Hell would’ve preferred a bowgun that looked like a machine gun than this.
Honestly i dont get the negative response of the community twords the movie 🙄 i mean sure they had to have some liberties with how to make the game into a 3+ hour movie but ffs open your minds and watch it.Take it as a One Shot instead of a majn universe movie.The Witcher has nothing to do with MHW yet you see Gerald jump into the game and same for other Capcom franchises.Enjoy the movie and move on.
Omg Capcom get a room ... and stop touching yourself.
I dont want to be rude but I think the Movie is going to be trash.
Bruh
well i guess we cant exactly complain that the main character in the film isn't featured from the games anymore.
I wish Monster Hunter World Or Iceborne would be crossplay would be cool I want to play with my pc friends but this update is gonna be cool
Welp, guess I might have to get Monster Hunter to play as Milla
do LBG users get U.S. Army guns?
Nobody asked for this....
Lol no thanks
To play this mission for fun,, I mdown for that, but a fan to the milla jovovich series? Hell no.
This is like doing a fusion dance with yourself.
Cursed af
MK 9, 10 & 11: We have movie Kharacters...  MHW: Hold mah BBQ Spit...
Capcom: Yo... we heard you like Monster Hunter; so we put some Monster Hunter in your Monster Hunter!
So they do this but we never got Alice in Resident Evil 6 multiplayer.
BRO THAT'S MY GIRL ( Alice ) FROM ALL THE RESIDENT EVIL MOVIES HELL YEAH!!! BIG FAN IM GETTING IT FOR SURE
I love monster hunter. I've played so many games, including MHW:I(2000+ hours😬)To see the series grow over the years has been quite the experience. Also so Pumped for the movie! If You guys ever do another collab, it should be a  dragons dogma collab!
YOU WHAT!!!??
Why not Tony Jaa? would be 10000% better.
The collaboration also comes with a murica red white and blue heavy bowgun. That's a wyvernheart.
Hard pass...
What’s with the man wannabe
Monster Hunter X *Milla Jovovich*  There i fixed it for you, now gimme Rise!
Thanks again for all the wonderful content you’ve provided. And is there any chance you could give me like 6 Fatalis evil eyes for 1,700+ hours of MHW gaming?
Dislike
I would rather have a anime collab to be honest lol
I’m gonna watch movie and play this, not expecting it to be great.
Thanks, this is the last piece of shit than I were needing for kick Monster Hunter and move to Dauntless.
I want my boy Tony Jaa.
That'll be a big nope, i'll just pass on this.
I hope she comes next on the resident evil game series..
Raise your hand if you ask for this
ergh....who forced you to do this?
I'm weak 😂😂 they really said "monster hunter x monster hunter what a perfect combination"
I just fuckin realized how does Jovovich understand what Tony Ja is saying in the movie if English doesn’t exist? And why is that the thing that actually bothers me about the film?
Capcom I like you and you know that! I’m only 3 percent in the game with nasty beast to slay before I get to magdaros! This is utterly garbage! Don’t complain i didn’t warn you but WE ALL KNOW THE MOVIE IS GONNA SUCK AND FLOP! what makes you think an Isekai (portal) monster Hunter movie is gonna work with the typical US military plot in a fantasy world!
Br aqui, os @irmaos piologo piram com esse filme kkkkkk
We already kno the movie is gonna suck But can I establish how she’s using the Carving Knife as a weapon?
They could put Gore Magala since he is on the trailer
artemis, or the best opportuniti to add Gore magala.... joke !! just go against that fuking diablos and rathalos kiddo
somehow you have to push this shitty movie
Look fun but  still  no goin back to play is kind bore  to do everything  alone
I heard you like Monster Hunter, so I put a Monster Hunter in your Monster Hunter so you can Monster Hunter while you Monster Hunter.
you can become the wife
Just a word. NOPE
love or hate the movie adaption thats about to be released but you have to at least admit that Artemis design  and voice over is really well done for this cross over.
I bet a 2 hrs lets play video with that costume would be better than the movie.
This looks so bad
Idk if the ruin my childhood or not... thought?
Bruh.. who the f... why the f.... you know what? Forget it, out of all the things they could've add, they do this smh
She looks distressingly white
Other people - This is hype!  Me - Resident Evil movies...
wtf capcom
i'll pass.
wow, i can finally play as "please don't sue me when i literally amputate your arm and rip your face off" director's wife in my fun videogame!!
If they have time for this they have time to work on arch tempered elder dragons
wow they put Milla Jovovich up against Diablos AND a Rajang...
if this movie bombs, this is gonna be one embarrassing update.
Will it replace my current layered not likely, but I’ll cook something up.
I hope this crossover includes an in game rocket launcher just like the movie
Capcom: you guys want new monsters and original weapon designs? Sure her- SIKE you thought haha idiots
That's where my birthday is im 16
And with the addition of mila jojovich, monster hunter world can be the c-tier movie it always wanted to be!
My brain literally stop working when I see this Like what...monster hunter collab with monster hunter with actress that play in resident evil movie
Missile launcher like in the movie??!?!?
Why did they even make the movie they have such great games but gave the movie license to one of the worst directors who made the awful live action resident evil movies
pq?
See guys? just because the final MAJOR update for Iceborne was released doesnt mean we wont still get peppered with some small stuff for a little while longer, we might even still get new arch temepred monsters, heres hoping we get AT Black Veil, Ruiner, and Shara, thatll be the dream, since AT monsters dont count towards Major updates, they just added them between major updates.
Self Collaboration?  thats some next level shit right there Capcom.  Cant wait for all the Ron Pearlman mods for the General :P
"i didn't ask for this"- Adam Jensen
The movie is gonna be good. Stay mad haters.
Looks like Max has to react to this 😆
This is the TRUE final update
Gore Megala, i predict, will be the final boss for this event!
the version everyone wanted in movie form
You should collaborate with the resident evil movies as well so then you can have two overpowered characters that are the same person
Que chido.
Nah skipping this one.
lol what
Wait what
Capcom what the fuck
My thoughts about: New MHW content- YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! / New MH Movie content- pls spare me this abomination
They just trying to push the movie at this point 🤣
where is "other joe"???/
No, I'll take some new weapons or layerd armor but I do NOT want a mila skin.
This is the worst. It makes that movie canon...
To think that the people who don't know the game will see the "Monster Hunter" movie and think that THAT is Monster Hunter. *Sigh*
Ah yes a Monster Hunter collab with Monster Hunter.  So sick
This gives me hope for a "Capcom Vs Capcom" fighting game
Give us an m16 lbg. PLSSS
She looks better in the game than she does in the movie tbh
I remember when they said last update was the last update but hey here's a new update to promote what is likely a garbage movie!
Yeah im sure even with this will not save the movie
I hope you will be able to choose different weapon, because I have no idea how to use dual blades. But I expect my embarassing gameplay with dual blades will still be much better than that movie, so after all I am fine anyway.
Nobody gonna talk about the fact SHE'S ACTUALLY USING THE CARVING KNIFE AS A WEAPON?  No one? okay. XD
please gore will be in this cause i wanna fight him. if not then im not doing this
Oh good, now I can play as an talkative piece of wood
The one DLC I shan't be returning for
I thought they wouldnt add anything to the game anymore.
Yeah but where are the machine guns mounted on jeeps?
Probably means december 4th will be when we get the events unlocked for good.   That's probably the only good thing this will bring.
"hey guys! i am gonna be in a movie about your game i don't know shit about!, now, i will have a character in your game too, so i will be 100% legitimate! i don't see why only Keanu would be the only one to have the honor... this is what you gamers wants, no? having big holywood stars on your games!"
LMAO!!!
What if CAPCOM gives us a whole story in the movie and everyone will be spoiled if playing this mission.
More excited for a little more game content than the movie, ngl
Whhhyyyyyy???
Why though?
POV: u scrolled to the bottom of trending
Nobody asked for this.
Add: asa.official  on Snapchat for good luck 🤯
i pray
This will be the only layered armor i'm not crafting!
First dlc announcement I don't care about
Kanye West ft Yeezy.
Let's just make sure Paul doesn't notice the other guest characters. No need for him to ruin the Witcher, Devil May Cry, or Horizon Zero Dawn.
so, where do I get my m249 for my bowgun?
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Thank you capcom!!! I love mhw im glad they’re STILL adding content. Hopefully one day i can get a ps5 for those sweet juicy loadtimes
oh no, the bad movie is going to really change things in the games too, that’s what I didn’t want, and they did, I hope it doesn’t change many things, because if not, the game movie will change the game itself, and make the game it was good to be bad
So the movie is now official canon in the monster hunter universe. Fucking hell.
I smell Corporate Elder Dragons.
Monster hunter the game is great but the movie will blow chunks harder then super mario bros the movie
LMFAO
Where is my machine gun?:/
Is this smart marketing or is this just Capcom pissing us off more since the live action Resident Evil movies?
Yo dawg, I heard you like Monster Hunter so we...yeah guys get the rest, I’m not gonna add to the already overwhelming theme of comments
ja pierdole
The game looking better then the movie.... 🤫
Goddamnit, Capcom! Why you didn’t use Nero instead?!
Origin of Hunter X Hunter
no
I though they already had a Resident Evil colab already...
Aww...on my birthday. Going to watch it in cinema of course.
Raw Dual blade 🤔 for sure it will be blue sharp so it will be a bad weapon  Also yeah the skin is cool but we can't have like just the chest or just the pants it will be a full armor again.. i would love if they can separate.. like that i can be a girly Leon !
The movie itself sucked, If the movie got replaced with this, Everyone would be satisfied.
They made mila jovovich more flatchested than the actual model.....wow Capcom that is a low blow indeed
Ok the only good thing I saw was really the admiral. Nothing more.  Always the trope "I am bad ass, i did it. Lol me awesome" from that chick is making me sick (yes I hate the movie already. GIVE SOME EMOTIONS. OMG.)  And well her. I dont like the fact that they had to choose pauls wife.. AGAIN... come on take ANY other actress.. The movie will be 50% alone from that in my opinion..
This is like Celldweller featuring Scandroid.
Gore Magala? O.o
What curse have you brought upon this world.
I don’t even want to touch this and I dislike playing dual blades.
Hunter x Hunter?
Why does Capcom continue to let Paul W.S. Anderson make movies off their IPs? He goes completely off script, makes trash and makes his wife the star in a role that makes no sense.
Smash Bros. should take a note from this and collab with Super Smash Bros.
I am expecting the Tigrex tank to return
Its nice to see them collab with smaller franchises.
Oh so it is canon they speak their own language
That movie is a mistake that no one cares about. Until they fire that piece of shit director, all Capcom movies will be garbage.
Hmmm, yes. The floor here is made out of floor
no thank u :)
The 10-minute collab quest will be better than the entire movie
Wow, so the Wyverian language is actually being used.
I wanna play as T.I
Can I sleep with the game director to get myself put in the game?
Artemis backwards is Simetra.  Overwatch collaboration confirmed!
The worst thing that could have come out of this franchise is now going to be in the best thing that happened to this franchise. is this how annihiliation happens?
At least her ingame character not using fire Dual Blade for fight with diablos.
hmm
Sorry I don't wanna wear something that reminds me of a poorly written MH movie.
I guess the leaker didn't expect this either
Its kind funny how she looks much better here than in real life.
Okay this is actually kinda cool
more updates ! okay i will take it
Well I for sure wasn't expecting that.
this looks bad
No please i beg you, keep Hollywood away from my games. It's bad enough that they steal the world and monsters from monster hunter and taint it with their american military imagery and Milo Jowitch (fuck you Paul). But now i have to see her horrifying face inside the game. Just give me a rest. Hollywood in all subversiveness and all its defilement should stay contained and avoidable and far far away from all that is good, beautifull and kawai in this world.
This could have been pretty epic if Gore was involved.
like witcher we had ancient leshen, let me guess     Its going to be tyrant isnt it?
Real bonkers am I right
play together ❤ ？😄
😍
Put the fucking arch tempered ruiner and valzahak and don't put shit that onli put you guys to promote the film
monster hunter X littlebigplanet when capcom?
Well, the movie is looking pretty dumb, but this looks nice.
The biggest take away from this is the self promotion collab. I see you Capcom.
fix we must face goremagala!
Gore Magala is coming aswell?
Oh God, no.
The only game who collaborate with themself Legend
Lets hope they can use this to make other DLC XD
I'm happy MH doesn't use the whole realistic graphics crap that westerners are Obsess with she looks out of place.
uh ok i guess
hopefully I'm able to interact using my own Hunter
This is gonna be better than the movie itself. I'm not salty. 😎
Please don't give this movie your money, please.
Fans: I thought you were finished  Mhw: my death was greatly exaggerated
Now announce monster hunter rise coming to consoles we already know it’s coming to PC so announce it for true consoles not the fake one 😤
You know something that was shown in the movie trailer (even if super early) and MHW could use instead of Mila skin? GORE MAGALA
This is real? Like really real?! Holy shit...LOL Why couldn't yall get T.I dammit XD
So y they ain’t been done this to resident evil🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️dey slackin
Oh no
Whooooooooa
Are you locked into using a fire weapon for these missions?
Wtf nooo
After all the monster hunter x capcom game.  Behold ! monster hunter x monster hunter
Whaatttt Damnnnnnnn
I would be more hyped if I could use the Admiral character (even if shrunk)
Drop It Like It's Hot, Ft. Snoop Dogg
Yay milla!
oh no....
Yuck
Why did you legitimize that piece of crap? I don't want Milla whatshername anywhere near my favorite game of the past two decades.
RPG HBG WHEN
i dont get it. who is that ugly chick? was there any movie scene inbetween or just some game footage? and the movies name will be " Monster Hunter World: Iceborne x "Monster Hunter" " ??? im gonna ignore the existence of this, like i do with post 4 generation pokemon
Oh boy i cant wait to play Monster Hunter character in Monster Hunter
Where Tony Ja?
No
this title "Monster Hunter", within quotes mark absolutely perfect lol
*Is this an out-of-season April's Fool joke?* No please...just no...
Nobody do this event, the movie is already so bad. Capcom needs to learn that handing your IPs out to every Tom Dick and Daniel.
*A cooperation nobody asked for. Money talks, i guess.*
Capcom: i do something called a ''progamer move''
OH DANGO!!!!
What about Tony Jaa for those of us who dont use female characters
"Monster Hunter Language"? Isn't this Japanese? :D
I'm surprised that a lot of people didn't see this coming! It's a Monster Hunter movie! Of course they're gonna do a crossover!!
Its one thing to make a movie out if a video game  But to put a movie into the video game the movies based off of
Don't forget to use Fire dual blades against Rathalos. Otherwise it won't be canon.
I'll never know why this guy keeps getting to make movies, he's such a shit director.
thanks a lot worldbabies.
well, i didn't even though that would happen too bad it wasn't bloodbath diablos
I took me a while for my mind to process what the title was trying to say lol
Admiral : using monster hunter languange So basically we re understand monster hunter languange
The event will probably be better than the movie
Ho maybe the Gore magala 😏
~~Milla Jovovich is now coming to Monster Hunter: World Iceborne~~  "Well, tell her to go home."
"GIVE US GORE MAGARA"
I don't know what's worse: This crossover actually happening, or the fact that Milla's character is named after the goddess of the hunt to justify her badassery.
I wish they bring gore magala 😐
0:17  Oh god her face🙁
What a beautiful surprise
I wish they give us the rocket Launcher and an apache skin for the pig
So umm.. No modern guns nor vehicles whatsoever? 10/10 best collab
Gore magala please 😭
Just... no
Gross.
Gross.
Welp, Mila fans that also play MH must be thrilled ^_^
shows how far the game and the movie are removed from each other, if they can even collab together.
I'd like collab with metal gear solid
I have no interest in the movie at all, but mot more free content is always cool.  Still. I'll be hugely surprised (and  pleasantly surprised) if the movie ended up NOT being awful.
I thought we were done! I am so excited,  even if its small content
No.
I would rather use the Handlers default skin than play as the worst thing from a movie with great potential.
NOBODY ASK FOR THAT
i still wanna fight a nightfury..
Yeah thats cool, now when are you gonna add Gore Magala?
Well, at least Capcom isn't denouncing the movie, even if we're expecting a trainwreck.
Gore magala confirmed?
Don't you fucking dare break my mods with that crap.
Mhw : give quest that have mila jovovivu as skin People : meh!  Mhw : release gore magala in the wild  People : holisy  Just speculation xD
What a waste of development time
Oh God no
This why do not need
m i l f  h u n t e r
booooooo
Monster Hunter Iceborne ft. MONSTER HUNTER 🤣🤣🤣
Well ill be damned!!!
So wait... if the people in the monster hunter universe have their own language how was Geralt able to understand them?
Milla's ego is probably through the roof rn
why don't you make meaningful crossover events instead of a junk movie
I never thought I would see the day....
what the fuck is that
nooooooooooooo
Now, you know what we want. GORE MAGALA, 'cause he's in the movie! 😂
No way, AWSOME !!!!
Can you add Gore Magala instead from the movie? Thanks xp
So... We have to pay for this one? 'Cause the last free update was Fatalis.
The admiral!!!Oh thank god!
Ew no
No, just no...  I've completet every single quest and killed every monster multiple times.  But this.... I'll pass.
Hunter x Hunter
Monster Hunter using Monster Hunter to promote Monster Hunter so you get interested and go watch Monster Hunter
Mods will make her...
OH MY GOD..this is reaaall Mia is soo bad ass
So to be clear Black Diablos get, Great Rathian get, Gore? - go f yourselves?
Ugh does this mean I have to fight a diablos with fire element dbs?
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww is coming
Me, when Iceborne was announced: "Wow, World was full of weird collaborations. I wonder what Iceborne will give us" The actual Iceborne collabs: Horizon Zero Dawn again, Resident Evil, and the Monster Hunter fanfic that Paul "My Incompetence lead to my wife's stunt double losing an arm" Anderson turned into a movie.
Yo Dawg! i heard you like Monster Hunter  So i put Monster Hunter into your Monster Hunter so you can Monster Hunter while you Monster Hunter
Nope. Not happening Capcom. Sorry, I will never accept the movie or Milla, no matter how hard you try.
Anytime I see her it's in movies that give no real representation of the game and butchers the franchise.... Monster Hunter was a good one.....  Let's not Forget Albert Wesker got killed by a door....  I bet that Diablos trips on a pebble, though it digs underground...
ohh update
I honestly hope you're able to pick your weapons, because I seriously suck at duel blades.
Always wanted to play as that one OP OC in the Resident Evil Movies
It's not over yet!
pog
I dunno if I want to watch it
I can feel it , gore magala is coming to world
no
Is Cool If  she can use heavy bowgun instead using a dual blades
Ehhhhhhhhh....
The Monster Hunter Movie is so different and has nothing to do with Monster Hunter anymore to that point that Monster Hunter can collab with it.
Admiral "Looks like you had it under control" Mila "I survived the apocalypse, this is nothing"
At least the model looks great
So glad to see they finally made a collab with a non-game again. It's been a long since the last one...
Even though the movie will be shit this is pretty cool
Yes but Gore Magala???
I have to level here with you, I'm afraid that movie is not going to please majority of fans. Why? Not because of the visuals are lacking, those are good, but because of the story. I still can't understand, who am I kidding I understand why, our main characters are AMERICAN ARMY people who magically got "isekaid" to the world of Monster Hunter. MH already has a storty that would have made a good movie in right hands, but getting those AmErIcAn DrEaMs filled is to get an american to be a hero.
The resident evil gang are almost complete.
No just no
OUR ADMIRAL!!!!!
*Main character of the movie*  Booooooo   *The Admiral*  WOOOOOOO
Please secretly put gore magala in the game please please please
So tasty!!!
It is called promo for the movie 😂
Not gonna lie. I'm actually stoked for a Milla Jovovich skin.
SHAMELESSNESS
Problem is, the movie don't look fresh to me...
Cringe alert!!cringe alert!!!bad movie incoming
I shleep.
i will go see the movie just for the monster  everything else looks pretty bad
It's like Capcom doesn't care about it's IP's and this woman has become the poster child of bad Video game to movie translations. They did this with Mila way back 15+ years ago and now they just opened up MH to this malarkey.
Jajaja aún ni a salido la película y ya van a sacar la colaboración XD
Artemis (Milla Jovovich), Ryu, Geralt of Rivia and Aloy go into a bar. They all eat and drink too much and three of them turn into zombies so Leon S. Kennedy has to beat them in an arm wrestling tournament.  Afterwards they go on an Adventure together and fight the behemoth from FF with a pair of fish, some beer mugs, a big leg of meat and a rocket fueled sword.  Then they go to the sauna and chill in the pool with some oversized cats in funny costumes. Ciri, Bayek and Claire Redfield who are also in the lobby join in. In the end they all go fishing.  No, that was not a feverish dream, it was just a regular day in Monster Hunter Word. Monster Hunter World: Iceborne - Where all your dreams came true that you didn’t knew you even had.
Who tf even wanted this
Fire dualblades on a diablos
not interested.
Ah yes iceborne had really good updates but i guess everyone can fuck up..
well it Canon lol that mean this Happen after the Movie ending and Monster hunter Multiverse (it still diffrent to Tony Jaa Monster Hunter Verse) Monster Hunter(Capcom) x Monster Hunter(Paul Anderson)
I uninstalled the game 2 days ago. Leave me alone! I've done EVERYTHING.
Ok, this gave me cancer. At least it's free but God, why?
Heuuuuuu
Fatalis will be the last update. "So that was a fucking lie". I hope the clutch claw made it into the movie and I hope everyone using it will suffer as all of us did.
Was inevitable in the end i suppose. But not only does that women get shoved down the throat of every video game franchise, now she also comes into the game itself. Disguisting.
Can I just.... forget the MH movie exists. Im going to watch it because Im intrigued. However, its just... hollywoodified. And most things when hollywoodified dont turn out well. Also MH language HELLO?!?!?
In b4 it’s just compilations of her getting carted
Political agenda strikes again I see.
is she looking for her husband?
Look at the dislike
we got this instead of an anime
Im comin back.
My dream after 2020: "I want to be a "good enough" actor so that I could get a collaboration with Monster Hunter and have my own character, so that I don't need to make my own custom character"
GORE MAGALA???
Quite frankly, I don't care about this crossover. I'm sick of Milla Jovovich's husband buying her the lead role in movies. I also burned out on Monster Hunter, partly because of the Reddit Monster Hunter World/Iceborne community went severely toxic during the Alatreon release, and never recovered.  I still love Monster Hunter though, and will buy more Monster Hunter games in the future.
*_Who Asked For This_*
Capcom: "Yo dawg, we heard you like Monster Hunter. So we put Monster Hunter inside yo Monster Hunter so you can hunt monsters while you hunt monsters."
look how the massacred my boy
Yes! This gives me hope that we will get one more final farewell update.  January 26, MHW 3rd year.  I just hope it’s a large update, new content, crazy rank 4 decorations combination like Atk/Crit, Crit/Crit Bonus, etc.  And Arch Tempered remaining Elder Dragon and Uber Wyverns like Rajang, Deviljo, and Beattlejuice.
Me:How about new monster!?  Milla Jovovich:duh?!
Mila jovovich pire actrice de la planète... j’ai envie de vomir ....
You know what it means? That just means Anderson not only made her wife the hero of half his VG adaptations... he now made her the hero of a VG he is playing.
remember not to support the film due to the director Paul W.S. Anderson having no concern for crew, allowing one death, an amputation and 15 hospitalizations to happen on Resident Evil
YO SON! I NEED THIS LAYERED ARMOR!
Ah yes, *monster Hunter language*, it’d be a real shame if nobody knew Japanese in the world she came from
I’m glad there still giving monster hunter world a lot of love. Because this is a well graphic game.
GORE MAAGALAAAAAAAA
Great
Nobody wants this cringe movie
No thank you. Fatalis was the best last free update. This would leave a bad taste in my mouth. You can cancel this now ☺️
But.... but why though?
worst DLC
😂
Go home, Milla.
I was wondering when theyd do this, but they couldnt even give her unique looking weapons lmfao
I have mixed feelings and that is all I will say.
oh fuck yes
I was a player who had a goal to get every special event armor in the game but this one I can confirm I won’t be getting. I’m sorry Capcom but ehhhh no😅
Collab with itself... Pog :v
Sponsored  by Capcom
They should have Tony Jaa’s skin for the field team leader when doing this.
I swear the monster hunter Dev had very *big brain*
I knew they were gonna do some type of quest based on the movie
I like that there is something new comimg to this game but I don't like the movie because it has nothing else but a good monster design.
my name is alice. and this is monster hunter
Ok but why though.
I can’t understate how much I love you.
oh wow... trash
Monster hunter language?
(Monster Hunter Language) Yeah, we know what Japanese is.
Knowing Capcom I'm expecting this to be on par with Street Fighter: The Movie: The Game
Im so sorry
Now that's cool.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐲
Is it bad for a sec I thought this was a parody?
Ohhh intersting so one last update
Due to that part of information leaked of Capcom was about how they would kneel to the western P.C. agenda, I can tell this update is one slight sign to lead them into that direction, even as now the connection still seems blurry...
no.
I'm thankful the RE movies weren't made at this point in time, or they'd have inserted Alice into the games.
Eu tô com vontade de me matar
Lol go capcom!
OH MY GOD!!!!! Thus is actually perfect and I want it NOW lol.
a collaboration that i never thought i wanted.
No surprise here. Only thing I hope and suspect is maybe gore showing up, since he appears to be a part of the monster hunter movie. But again I'm probably wrong.
(MONSTER HUNTER LANGUAGE)  0:29
Finally, I can drop sticky bowgun and switch to an AR-15.
All I have to say is that the SFM "art" community thanks you...
MH^2
Monster Hunter x random actor
i hope im not supposed to use dual blades for the quest  *hammer go spin to win*
My friends keep making fun of me for being a DS user because of her. Now its like rubbing salt in the wound to see this crap.
Looks shit.
i gonna do the skin just to loose my hunts on purpose
cooool.....
バイオコラボにしか見えんw
im ready to fight black diablos with fire dual blades!
Obama giving Obama a medal
Admiral why are you suddenly talk like that when you perfectly capable speaking english before?
I never thought I'd see the day.... Monster hunter the game... The movie... The game
The "Monster Hunter" movie is in quotation marks because even Capcom doesn't want to acknowledge that movie has anything to do with them.
Kind of sucks their first movie is probably gonna bomb. If you have seen the trailers you know why
I can't wait for the movie! Why? The Palico of course!
Capcom: "fatalis is 100% the last update." also Capcom: (puts entirely new armor and event in the game.)  i just dont believe capcom when they say that they are done with world/iceborne. is that so bad?
As long as I don't have to use fire DBs on a Diablos, I'm good.
Cuco apesta... vivan las morzas
Im still waiting and all that for that lagiacrus that was shown in that Mhw demo.
Did MH just collab with themselves
I can see MK colabs   here come two challengers:  Terminator Rambo
Let's be honest, because I will.  *I thought, for a split second, someone from Terminator was gonna be involved.*
Her 3D character model looks accurate but it still really feels like she should stay put in the movie together with her poor man's Odogaron-inspired armor and all.
this is borderline experimental
I knew this was coming but still. No Capcom.  You know that movie looks funny bad deep down.
This makes sense
More portals? i can see why Geralt hates them, that shit just takes you wherever.
But how many stuntmen had to die or get maimed for this to be made is the real question.
It supposed to be Jill!!!
Why Capcom? Why?
I thought this game wasnt giving us any new content but yet again monster hunter proves why it is one of the best games to come out in the last 10 years
Well that’s something to cross off my bucket lists i guess...witness a game collab with itself
MHW: Fatalis will be the last title update.  so that is a fucking lie.      ngl im happy
Yikes..... that looks bad.... The visuals on her face, and armor, look *bad*, and I'm not one that usually complains about that kind of stuff. I'm on the fence about this considering the movie looks bad concept wise. (On the fence, and with baited breath on it... God i hope it's actually surprisingly good.)
Nid tony jaa skin not milla pls ty
The main character somehow teleported to New World, hmm where do I have seen this before 🤔
Yo, i heard you like monster hunter, so we put monster hunter in your monster hunter!
I'd rather wear the Tony Jaa layered.
Yes I will love to see the seven people that will use that layered armor.
An entire rich world of stories and they turn the movie into a resident evil rip off.
Remember guys, the title using double apostrophe symbol. That means it's different franchise, lol. The movie not recognized as part of game franchise.
thank you for the new content.. hope more title expansion for MHW ,, please..
no thanks
Please give us Arch-Tempered Ruiner Nergigante
Movie "collab" : meh More Admiral cutscene : AWOKE
Looks cool, I hope that’s layered armor tho.
Nah fam
To this day I still wonder "Why an isekai when the characters could perfectly have been from the MH world from the start?"
"Monster Hunter" in quotation marks makes me laugh at this so much.
So are we gonna get a new monster from this?
I'm not sure how I think about this. The movie might be trash.
well, more new thing to do for me. also can we get Tony Jaa? :D
So we HAVE to use Duel Blades......m'kay.  I mean I've already killed 3 of them with the damn things, what's one more.
Gross
I always apriciated the developers of world knowing what the fans loved, with them bringing back fan favorite monsters and all that..... but the monster hunter movie? Really? Probably the only movie that everyone disliked? They give us Fatalis and say it's the last big update and then that? God damnit....
Monster Hunter made a DLC with Monster Hunter Inception
I hope it doesn't come as a set. I just what the chest piece.
Am i sad or happry
I don't want to watch that movie, but I refuse to don't finish all the quests
I thought updates were done with? You sneaking hunters
My only hope from this is gore magala
Caraí os monstros tão fodidos espera só ela usar tecsineze e da muito tiro e mortal pra trás
The final and main monster/villain should have been The Black Dragon, Fatalis. This monster is the most strongest and most dangerous monster in the games (not considering the subspieces)
Ngl, i really like the armor
You can now play as Milla Jovavich.
They say it's a collab with the movie, but all I see is Iceborne X Resident Evil movie
oh the US Military movie 😂
Dumpster fire 🔥 movie and director has no shame.
I kinda don't need it... but well.
If you complete this quest, Meowscular Chef will look like the one in the movie... Permanently.
That's the real “ MH × RE ” in game.
I like Milla
So awful, I am not going back to the game to get that ugly skin. Seriously? No jill or DMC V dante vergil or Nero Collab capcom?
I cant wait to use fire dual blades against a diablos like in the trailer!!!
This is like doing "Mario Party 9 x Luigi's Mansion."
Where is Tony Jaa??
Monster Hunter collabbing with Resident Evil. Some Capcom on "Capcom" action.
Tony ja?
no shade to Mila but i feel like Tony Jaa is gonna carry the majority of the action in this film and i’d much rather have a skin of him..
Well I can’t say I expected this lol
Final Update my
Yeah but will we get the magalas?
MONSTER HUNTER X MONSTER HUNTER
Ok so 2020 has me paranoid...  Is this real?
This is really cool, regardless of my thoughts towards the movie and its director.
DOes this mean Gore Magala???
I'm sorry was anyone going to tell me there was a Monster Hunter Movie or was I just suppose to find out from this amazing DLC trailer?
Eww
This is so stupid.
Actually been wondering if they'd do it
No
I don't think with the numerous Resident Evil films Milla ever got featured as a playable character in the games, and not she gets one after her first Monster Hunter film. The irony lol
Paul wes anderson and milla jovovich shitting on another capcom franchise
One of the best games I've ever played
Finally I can play monster hunter in monster hunter I always wanted to do that
"OH NO!!" in Joseph Joestar voice
They collaborated with themselves, the mad lads, lol. On another note, this is great! Most people thought that they were "done" with Iceborne. This gives us more motivation to play! :)
I wasn’t expecting more stuff AT ALL, this is a VERY pleasant surprise.
NGL this looks amazing
Never asked for this but ok i guess
Oh so this is like Witcher quest where you have to play as Geralt eh? Damn I was about to think to use the beloved Kjarr Ice to that black diablos but it seems gotta play with the provided weapon.
(Insert putting medal on self meme)
well in the film, Gore magala did appear tho, if you can give me Gore, maybe i will be excited for this update lol
Gore Magala stealth drop pls?
"Tony Ja" pls
0:30 idk why but the admiral made me laugh , the monster hunter language in a monster hunter x monster hunter collab 😂
Weird...if the Monster Hunter World inhabitants have their own language then how was Geralt able to understand them.😅
It's just a Diablos we should be fine right
Monster Hunter X Monster Hunter.  And they said Smash Ultimate was the biggest crossover.
Well, It's more free content I guess. All we need now is a humvee  mount 😂😂😂
So, they gonna put Alice in the game?
Monster hunter really collaborated with themselves
Ppl: I'll skip the movie Capcom: Nope
Take notes NetherRealm
COLLABCEPTION!!
Giant rathalos?
🤢🤢🤢
Look something no one asked for! I’d rather have an update with a new letter font than this.
Ah yes, Monster hunter X Monster  hunter. The crossover I have been waiting for.
DANK.
Never thought I wouldn’t be excited for a collaboration event, first for everything I guess.
OMG, first they nerf Safi, and now this? Just when I thought leaving us blue-balled without the other ATs was not shitty enough...   At least I hope the Hunter shows her how it is done, and that you DO NOT USE FIRE AGAINST RATHALOS.
What was the deleted video about?
Remind to NOT support this movie because a stunt woman lost an arm due to the director’s incompetence
oh great a new new update... oh well... at least its a new content
I LOVE U CAPCOM!!!!!!! xD
You can feel the lack of enthusiasm they had for putting this video together
gross
Gore magala added
😮
gross
Yea sorry I love monster hunter but I’m just gonna wait for monster hunter rise.
Lol. . . why would the put MH X MH thats like saying Monster Hunter Iceborne X Monster Hunt 1, Fatalis.
We are getting this instead of missing arch tempered elders in master rank?
MH Devs never cease to surprise us huh?
[[Gaming company creates content to promote new movie]]  [[Internet]] Let's show our support by being petty!
Sure, for those dual blades. o.o
one last kick in the balls
Screw it I'll take any more Monster Hunter world any way I can get it.
the only way they can make the movie canon
I might be crazy but... Gore?
Fair enough I guess but I hope there's more to it than just a Diablos.
"Featuring the Monster Hunter from the Monster Hunter series!"
Dumb
I'm going to throw up.
Does this mean we are finally getting Nerscylla or Gore Magala?   Probably not, it’s MHW but still
literally no one asked for this
* Horryfing cries * Me: i-i knowed you wanst Just dead!!! ur not a dead game yeat!!
Please don't be the MR collaboration quest that is on the same level as the Witcher 3 or FF14 collab quests. Just let it be something that sits forever in the Event Quest menu that I never have to do
the successful game, collabing with the less than liked but yet to be released movie tie in... this might go well.
Please let the monster be a zombie tank Or some shit the movie will probably have.
watch them introduce fucking attack helicopters lmfao
Nice I can use this skin to troll others online by fainting rapidly as well with it.
"Monster Hunter Language"
I wonder, if the movie rates high enough will they give us gore magala in world as a gift
Does your Palico die during a stunt in this event?
Look, a pear of probably raw dual blades
I though MHW already had collab with Resident Evil..
MoHun fans: Wow Capcom, you shouldn't have! Capcom: Anytime b! MoHun fans: No, you *really* shouldn't have.
Does anyone else like the fact that Monster Hunter Movie has quotation marks around "Monster Hunter"? It's as if Capcom themselves are questioning whether the movie is really a Monster Hunter movie.
This is the one thing in MH I'll be avoiding. Why would you make a collaboration with that Hollywood abomination? Fk Hollywood for always ruining nice things.
... Are they emplying the movie is a prequel? Please don't. I don't want to watch that.
Oh...?
dislike all you want i bet ya'll still gonna watch it anyways lol
First time I've ever said this about any MH content but damn, that looks ass lol
ew
Alice😍😍😍
In house crossover.
It’s like Springfield and Shelbyville.
Now I'm dazed and confused. At least it's something to fiddle.
worst outfit, WTF, fuck this
Milla got in a Monster Hunter game, before a Resident Evil game. I would love to see Alice in any Resident Evil game, even as a dlc mercenaries or raid mode type character.
Resident Evil 2.0
when they told you that Fatalis would be the last free update   But they were lying! >:C
Hopefully we can fight a giant Rathalos.
I cant wait to flirt with the Meowscular chef as Milla Jovovich in real life. Thanks Monster Hunter
Mila J = No Tony J = Yes
Not getting this DLC
I want the Rocket Luncher with the Iron Sight tho.
what?
I notice noone has mentioned the possibility that Gore Magala might be coming to Iceborme as well! Considering it's in the movie.
On my birthday! :O
The admiral is about to uppercut her into the real world
Does this mean we will get gore? since the movie also has Gore magala
Hoooo me vengoo
....suppose I can do that quest for lols
CAPCOM X CAPCOM LETS FUCKING GO
God darn it, they did it. They had one more left in them.
Hmmmm.... Does anyone else feel the Witcher Quest vibes here? In both quests, someone appears out of a portal, and in both guess your not gonna be playing as your hunter.
When you realize they did this just so the crybabies can stop crying that the movie has nothing to do with the game hahahahaha
Here you go monster hunter.  Thanks monster hunter! No problem monster hunter.
This is unreal and bizarre. It's like if Alice got into the actual Resident Evil games (which thankfully will never happen)
I can't put into words how not excited I am for this
Sooooooo... no gore magala ?
What if you wanted Monster Hunter in Smash Bros but instead they put Monster Hunter in Monster Hunter
This iiiis... disgusting.
Me: I thought you were dead! Monster Hunter World: Me too!
... god no...
M4a1 layered skin for lbg im calling it :D
Really
The movie is still gonna be so shit
(Insert J Jonah Jameson laughing meme here).
Omg 😲 I get to have my waifu in MH! 🤣 ♥ ♥ ♥
I bet you guys there will also be a collab or special quest once MH Rise is near.
*Confused Mini sounds*
Amiral "Is now using Monster Hunter language" Artemis : I don't understand that. Geralt : I don't need this to understand. Moogle : It was a different language?
I know it won't happen but it'd be cool if Gore Magala was added with the Collab since it'll be in the movie
Oh yeah, I forgot that movie was coming out next month
That armor looks sick.
NO
They deserve each other.
I just thought of it now! This is a special assignment that may be re-playable like the Witcher quest. Let me guess, black diablos and then the gold crown rathalos.
I bet the palico armor is the movie version of meowscular chef
i cant stand this fucking director, Paul w. anderson i think his name is
I prefer a nargacuga sub especie :v
The admiral dropping out the sky is legit
Now you’re speaking my (Monster Hunter Language)!
so the handler got the skin from the movie to? :D
Monster hunter x monster hunter makes me think of some weird hunter x hunter rip off
All nice and good until she gets the red dress.
How many times we've seen RE movies with Millia? How many of them failed?
This is better than the movie
When they said last title update i knew!!!!! It was there own way of being a savage and being #1
What a crossover. I bet nobody saw *this* coming.
Goremagala is in the movie right? You don't think?...
why not use admiral skin from the movie hahaha 😂
Wish they would give us the monster hunter rise outfit
Uninstalled
thank god they didn't make the Admiral look like the one in the movie, yikes.
If it's collab.. their will be chance to add gore magala
Is the monster hunter language literally Japanese
Wait whaaaaaaaa?
That movie looks cringe as fuck
Bring AT Ruiner Nergi and AT Shara instead of this crap :(
Carajo grite como vieja por saber el último evento
what if... and get this,..,.,.. you~! were the monster hunter...... ALL ALONG>>>!??!??!?!!! oh my goooooooddddddddd
Lol this quest is gonna be Slay Black Diablos with Low Rank DB and basic hunter armour set. May as well say “just go rape me please Black Diablos”
Now this is the movie we deserve
*Featuring Monster Hunter from the Monster Hunter Series*
o.o
See you at theater
Arch tempered black diablos? Lol 😂
Capcom, please stop letting W.S. Anderson near your intellectual property. Sincerely, everyone.
I can’t wait to play Milla Jovovich and it gonna be awesome that she gets to be in a game finally I be waiting for this moment and I can’t wait for it I’m so excited to play my girl Milla Jovovich oh yeah this gonna be amazing to play Milla in the game for the first time ever
Just casually laughing at the fact that the Monster Hunter is in quotes
Ah! My cue to uninstall the game, sell it, and wait for Rise to release.
Who said there are no updates after fatalis?
✨😳✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ミラボレアス・ジョボビッチ❗️
Wow, even Capcom has a sense of humor.
Wtf seriously
Gore?
Why  the fuck give credit to a washed up actress who's only claim to fame is doing a nude scene in literally every movie she's done?! WHY?! I say CANCEL that collab! First one to cancel! Capcom knows we hate Anderson, and we don't want the shitty movies he's done tied with any of Capcom's franchises!   The only just way to end this collab if it does go live is to kill Milla's character off! That would be the only acceptable way to do it!   CAPCOM! LISTEN UP! BAN ANDERSON FROM POISONING YOUR FRANCHISES!
They couldn't resist could they.
Sekiro X monster hunter iceborne should be a better choice...
This is an insulting send off to the game.  They could have just added the remaining arch tempered monsters here and there and say goodbye... But no.  They had to shit on it by adding this garbage.  It's like having a delicious full course dinner, then being served a steaming pile of shit for dessert and force fed it. Why are you sullying our memory of the game with this vile trash?
Why do you hate your own series, Capcom?
MONSTROUSLY..........     unexpected and expected at the same time!🐉
We already had a Resident Evil collab. wtf.
...those dbs better be good
Bruh.....
Where's gore tho
Not going to watch the movie, not going to play this quest
Buff Lance.
When the game collab looks better than the movie
Oooookaaayy dude
Took me a while to get it... At first I was like... *_another_* RE crossover?!
Well Hey maybe if the dev team is into the movie, they'll help make sure the movie is decent?
Not bad
Lol wow
A new fricking event you say?????? Better get my ranks up, thanks Cacpom!
oh god
Movie looks like trash unfortunately.
Disappointing to see so many people being so negative about the movie, I think it's going to be a fun one to watch regardless of the writing. Looking forward to both this and the film!
Ah yes, the event quest NOBODY asked for...  Can Paul Anderson kindly f-off instead of repeatedly shoving his wife down our throats ?
Capcom :  Makes Milla Jovovich's character playable in World  Modder on PC   :  *┬┴┬┴┤( ͡° ͜ʖ├┬┴┬┴*
It's nice to see the movie showing up in the game. Maybe the game can show up in the movie, too.
hollywood game movies suck, especislly when it's capcom and mila jovovich involved...and now this?? i hate capcom and their love for this stupid actor
OMG
Thats going to be a no for me
Maaan, ya couldnt bring my man Tony Jaa into this game as well?? Missed opportunity Capcom.
Where's AT Shara???????????
I'm hoping it can be layered armor as well - that way I can wear this while having 0 armor pieces equipped, use the dual blades and cart 3 times on every hunt
On the one hand this movie looks like hot garbage, on the other hand: yay free quest
I'll pay money to not have this in my copy of the game. Come on, Capcom. Give me the option to remove this content for $10.
At this point I’m hoping the movie pulls a sonic the hedgehog and ends up being surprisingly good  If only...
Can you imagine if they added Gore Magala at the very last minute 😂
Let me use t.i
I love monster hunter but, I'm not looking forward to this cash grab of a cringe-fest movie.
Yo dawg.  I heard you like monster hunter.     So I put some monster hunter, in your monster hunter.
At the very least make us have the option to use seperate pieces of the layered armor. I don’t want my hunter to look like Mila Jovovich just to wear the armor.
comes with hip hop quest music
And just like that: Friendship ended with Monster Hunter: World Monster Hunter: Rise is my New Best Friend
Damn it I was half expecting Gore magala to make some appearance but looks like we ain't getting him anytime soon
Everybody ranting and capcom is gonna make this set super OP... new meta incoming ! 😂😂😂
Why.. just why
Very pog capcom, very pog
Id be happy if they added gore or that new rathalos with this new collab.
What a plot twist if I had ever seen one.
Cringe
You know its not too late to not release this.
I'm guessing you need to skin a stunt performer alive to make this set.
Monster Hunter x Paul Anderson's wife
Knew there was one update more concerning Iceborne.
*_(Monster Hunter Language)_*
ThAt wAs tHE LaSt UpDatE.   I Have been living a lie.
YES!!!!
....    aight free stuff   thx capcom
we said her armor dosnt resemble any MH armor.... well i guess we are wrong now hahaha
Well...it's Free so it doesn't really hurt, besides Milla Jovovich Looks awesome in here!
So you mean  I get  to  play as the one thing that is the worst part of the movie! Wow I can't wait... oh what's this? I'm afraid I have 999 better things to do on December  4th, what shame right,  guess I won't be doing  this  "great" event.
new monster please
Milla Jovovich's awful acting now infects Iceborne. God save us all...
No.
What a great time to be a dual blades main. I'm gonna layer those for my fire element Kjarr blades.
Ew
The possibility of actually making a better movie with Artemis as a skin than the live action made me laugh harder than it should have.
"hey, maybe we still get a cool collab like DMC in iceborne right guys?" *-capcom proceeds to shove this piece of shit collab with the movie that nobody who play this shit cares for-*  Seesh, what a shame, i thought we would get a cool collab even though the game is already finished, glad i uninstalled this shit already.
I'm actually surprised that Capcom even acknowledges the movie in-game. But if the Meowscular Chef comes in to assist you in a fight then I'm 100% behind this DLC
Capcom: here's the final update *Gives more updates*  You haven't done have you?  Capcom: hehe, nope
Bruh.
Meh.
*sees carving knife*  that thing better be beyond purple sharpness if it can cut through very thick skins.
I love the game, but this is there worst collaboration. Movie looks like dumpster fire trash
Yikes
More fucking portals
I can't wait to watch that movie.
Eww I'd rather have Tony Jaa over Paul's waifu.
Where's Gore Magala, Capcom?
You know what? This is actually pretty cool ngl. Not too excited about the movie outside of seeing the monsters but still neat
So if Monster Hunter is Collabing with Monster Hunter, does that make this.... HunterXHunter? :3
Wheres the Kaiju sized Rathalos, and Nerscylla
(Monster Hunter language)
Damn, so this is the TRUE final quest for Monster Hunter World. The one to surpass Fatalis and AT Velkhana.
I bet you in the movie she wouldn't be able to move as acrobatic as she does in the game. On the other hand, where's Tony Jaa in this collaboration? That's the guy who I want to play as in the game.
Oh, Capcom, maybe since you're still itching working on this game somewhat, maybe do a next-gen console optimization before you close the curtain? This game will still have a lot to give to people who just jumped in long after the live service ended, would be a waste to have it held back.
This is officially above my paygrade
this is like what FGO does all the time.
After finally beating Fatalis: you were good, Iceborne, really good... Maybe even the best. Capcom: ...There is more!
This is pretty cool actually, and its gonna be Mila voice. Even if this is coming from a bad movie
Instead of new ATs like Shara or Ruiner... we get this instead T.T
Finally, monster hunter²
When some normie who enjoyed watching the movie asked when will it get a game adaptation
This could be a HR quest based on the armor and blades lol
Can you don't
Bruh moment
I never thought that Monster Hunter would colab with Monster Hunter. I mean that idea is just inconceivable.
Disliked
No. Remove this. She is an insult to the fans and the franchise.  Capcom did you learn nothing from the RE movies?
I don't know why there's so much hate in the comments... I'm just so happy to receive something new in a game that I love and I thought nothing more will come out!!! 😭😭😭 Thank you... I'm just so freaking happy Iceborne is not dead yet.
Please make this un-exist. Thanks.
This will be better than the movie
Wait an event for the movie with cutscenes and everything and in the movie there was Gore Magala hold on... Hold On...... HOLD ON
Am I the only one who was caught off guard by the Admiral speaking Monster Hunter language?
I hope they add gore magala in this quest
Will we get the Meowscular Chef armor tho? 😅
GIVE ME AT SHARA YOU COWARDS
Can't wait to see this with the buff mod.
I like those dul blades a lot
NOOOOO they should have replaced the admiral with the scuffed ron perlman admiral from the monster hunter movie 🤣
The one layered armor I will not be getting.
Capcom : Fatalis is the final update  Also Capcom : but there is more !
Nani!?!
delete lol
Oh boy, the update that no one wanted or asked for!  Shilling the movie won't make it be less shit Capcom
Why would you hack such a company...
Gym teacher: okay everyone grab someone and form a pair.. Monster Hunter: ... Gym teacher: what's wrong MH? You don't have a partner Monster Hunter: It's okay... *I'll do this myself*
I have been calling The Monster Hunter Movie Monster Hunter DLC all this time. wwwwww xD lol
Is this where we finally get to hunt...  THE ADMIRAL?
Unless we get that jeep with machine gun I'm out
wario64
the most ambitious crossover in Capcom history since Street Fighter the Movie the Game the SNES port  & somehow this money sink of an In-Name-Only Mila Jovovich simp tape is a more acceptable advertisement than allowing Hololive to stream & actually showcase your games...
With this collab can we at least get one more new monster in iceborne?Dont really care about the milla skin but a new monster would be welcomed 😁😁😁
I don't how to feel about this  On one hand we get more Monster Hunter content  On the other it's the movie with Mila Jovich
Pirate cowboy was here from the order of the laughing dragon
I saw this coming!!!
Just make serious Handler skin for Handler please
Don't drag a great game down by associating it with what will no doubt be a piece-of-shit movie, D:
I have a statement... *AHEM* ... _no_
LEZ GOOOO NEW CONTENT
If we don't get an M134 Minigun Bowgun... I'm going to riot.
please tell me -narcylla -greater rathalos -or gore magala thats all i ask
Wtf i thought there was no more new content.
Ew... Just ew, Ill gladly skip this event.
Giving yourself a high-five
let them haters swallow!
At this point, the people over at Astera and Seliana would just sigh at the news of an off-worlder stranding on their world.
This colab has been leaked all the way back from 2005!
I legit thought it was a resident evil movie cross over 😭😭😭
If anything closely related to the collab we want modern guns coz immersion
What in the world?!?!?  That caught me off guard.
I just want them to pull a similar stunt as the witcher quest and have a section of the mission be "monsters? Don't worry we have our best hunter holding an ENTIRE ECOLOGY SISTEM on his own so you can prance around the area."
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!
well i have a reason now not to watch the movie ill just play as mila and then eff the hell black diablos and everything XD
"I use Monster Hunter to promote Monster Hunter" - Capcom
Monster Hunter collab with Monster Hunter. I did not see this one coming
Monster Hunter X Monster Hunter, this is the most pogchamp thing I have ever witnessed
Oh no
Oh so this is a thing now. I really do hope by some miracle of god that the film doesn't suck, it most definitely will, and I hope the rewards for this quest are good, probably won't be but still.
Omg love you guys and yes I’m going to the movie now
Is she still using Dual Fire blades against a black diablos thats resistant to fire.  :)
This shitty movie didn’t deserve a crossover
Wait, which ones witch? XD Jkjk...but srsly, who won? Ruiner nergigante or nergigante?
I honestly dont know what to think of this... I dind really give any thoughts to the movie because I fear it will suck, but why did they do this? Could'nt they just give us a new monster or just scrap this idea all together if decided not to put new monsters in the game? I kinda prefer not getting anything new in the game... than this.... is that wierd? Am I wierd? Im probably wierd... IDK what this is! What is life!? CONFUSED SCREAMING!
Literally no asked for this. Capcom ...
I'm happy for new content and surprised
PLEASE PUT NERZILLA AND GORE MAGALAAA!!!
why
Monster Hunter X Monster Hunter Series
I don't know how to feel that this is likely the last piece of content coming to MHW.
p a i n.
😂 Serious choice, capcom? :D Mh movie x mhwi? Mhxx x mhwi would ne Better, with hunting arts
Wait, Monster hunter will be in Monster hunter?! Smash and the MCU better step up their game.
Hell yeah
Gore magala coming soon?
so can someone explain to me?
Next collab is gonna be resident evil 3..... extinction... just give her a gun and bam
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I dont know exactly how to feel about that...
Ideia boa em filme ruim devia ser considerado crime !!!
Can we have a modern gun?🤣🤣
I'm still not watching the movie until it becomes available fr free on torrent
Gross.
Fight Paul W.S. Anderson, who protects himself from your attacks by sacrificng stunt men.
Does this mean we're getting Greater Rathalos?
M134 HBG
Finally a HunterXHunter collab
The only person who I can think of that's excited for this is directing the movie.
Yes!
Wow I saw it coming,to I thought it would be on Rise.
(Monster Hunter language)
No, thanks.
Well the good thing is we now have a Mila Jocovich model for sfm ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Just like the movie, this looks like it's going to be absolutely dogshit.
inb4 they pull a total fucking shyamalan and stick gore magala in the quest as an invader... ngl that would make me start playing again
Well.. At least we can see more of the Admiral
Now just add Gore Magala...
So what are we? Some sort of video game movie produced by Tencent?
Why? Did they really desperate to get us to see the film that much? Lmao
we want tony jaa !!!
Can't wait for these quests to be better than the actual movie
I have no confidence the movie will be good, but I like the armor.
Guys. Its Monster Hunter... collabing with Monster Hunter ICEBORNE!!   oh mer gerd.
NUDE PC MODS LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I know they're done adding Monsters. But, it'd be sweet if they added Gore Magala, since it's in the movie too.
I dig
i mean, did anyone really want this collab? do people really love Jovovich enough to WANT to play this??
I will not
I see a black monster on the hunt, but it is not Gore Magala
why
I NEED RON PERLMAN ADMIRAL. NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS
Welp, I sure did called it! Collab event! XD
Breaking the fourth wall here.
Everyone is making self-collab jokes but I think this quest looks real neat! Can’t wait to play it
And gore magala pack? :3
and....no Tony Jaa? seriously capcom? the guy deserves it, bring him into the game!
..................
Do you know how big plates are? Yep that's the size of my eyes after seeing this trailer😃 I CAN'T WAIT
i wonder if this'll be a solo quest like the one with the Witcher.
"Avengers is the most ambitious crossover" Monster Hunter : "Hold my well-done steak"
MK11 just did something similar with movie representation. This is dope, TBH.
The series no one one expected monster hunter to crossover with, *monster hunter*
Is nothing sacred anymore
YOOOOOO LETSSS GOOOO NOW CAPCOM PUT GORE MAGALA UN MHWI!!
I can't belive
yay i'll be able to play this new quest on the PS5. \o/
When a dumb reskin looks times better than the actual movie trailer...  Why didn't you just contract some decent animation studio like Digital Frontier, or Marza Animation Planet ?!
Please tell me there is going to be another collab quest with the same effort seen for this quest. As much as I know this promotion may get Capcom money, I still have a bad feeling in my gut.
The smartest move would have been to separate the games from the movie as much as possible imo
How far, does this quest go, is it like you going to play the entire movie, because if so imagine if we fight Gore magala
This is 'Obama giving himself a medal'-moment
Meta af.
Just when I think I’m out, they pull me right back in!
So is this selfest?
Can you refund free updates?
Bad movie cool gear to unlock
worse than 9/11
Monster Hunter collab with Monster Hunter. That's like liking your own posts.
LMAO looks so bad :)
MHxMH? Gonna be my new OTP.
I was wondering if this would happen
I find it strange how that trash movie made it into the actual game.
Wow so now the movie is cannon?
I better see her doing dual blade moves in the movie lmao
Not sure how I feel about this one.
Thank you capcom
Wow, Monster Hunter's collaborating with Monster Hunter! That's so poggers.
MHW team: _We're done making stuff._  Also MHW team: _We're not done making stuff._
Fatalis armor users: k
No.
More content and I get to play as my favorite female actor bro let's goooo
Dear MH, we dont want this.
It reminds me of this mod for some reason https://youtu.be/ub82Xb1C8os
And boom, gore Malala
Welp... I hope that the Movie is going to be good, otherwise it's not going to age well
Where's Arch tempered ruiner!😭
So much for fatalis being the last dlc.
The only armor set I refuse to collect lol
Jesus Christ
At least we get more Iceborne content, thanks movie...I guess?
No one wanted this. Please distance yourself from this future trainwreck of a movie.
Me: *Accidentally predicted the monster hunter movie collab* https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/591200311700619294/780963575715201044/unknown.png Me: what have I done
*vomits profusely*
yikes
At least you don’t play as her husband.
I want Tony Jaa instead
Yikes
As a Dual Blades main, I am pleased.
On my twiiter, @athemwulf i made fakes images about this 1 year ago... this is amazing.. im Nostradamus.
This is like a rapper guest-starring on their own album.
You mean we might get Cephalos, Nerscylla, and Gore Magala in MHWI?!
Don’t want
the like ratio being so fucking high compared to the dislike actually makes me angrier than yellow monke
trash she dont belong in this great game
So much for Fatalis being the last content update
Thank God they didn't not change Admiral face 😅😅😅
okay but gore magala when?
Nope.   Don't like that.
Jovovich 💪
Uh
“My name is Artemis, and this is my story.”
Ngl kinda sick
Can we get the armor standalone from her talentless mary sue face? Please and thanks
I know it's not happening and all but I can't help but hope that there is one more surprise in the form of Gore Magala showing up in the game. Like I said, I know Fatalis was the last one that came but a guy can dream can't he?
No I don't want that
Just waiting for the dislike bar explode rn
This scream spiderman pointing at each other meme
disappointed that theres no ron perlman admiral cowards
Watch the event quest storyline end up better than the movie's
Capcom in this moment:  *the only one who is in pair with me is myself*
Will this quest spoil the movie tho?
This is a good opportunity to add gore magala ;)
How bout the greater rathalos?
We are missing Tony Hawk :v
Not sure how good the movie will turn out being, but this is pretty cool. Now Jovovich can play as herself in game.
i bet this is what is gonna happen if its good i will eat my own words but the movie is going to flop hard and then we will never get another chance at a monster hunter movie because the director is the director of the resident evil movies and yiikes i dont think those were any good either
Please say this is a joke...
Bien, donde esta mi shara ishvalda archi
Hunter X Hunter PogChamp
wait... We know gore and greater rathalos is in the new movie and this seems to be a larger drop then just 1 event quest, and there was that one time when the admiral fought that black monster...Eh probably just going insane.
"Looks like you had that under control" More typical Milla Jovovich... unsurprising.
as much as I apreciate it, I know already that the movie sucks and the director is also a piece of shit so this is would be nice if the movie wasn't such a disgrace. I ain't mad about it tho
Okay but BUNGEE GUM HAS PROPERTIES OF BOTH GUM AND RUBBER
*_NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!_*
*monster hunter language*
Oh fuck off...  We all know the movie is going to be shit.  It's Paul W. S. Anderson.  This is the guy who ruined the Resident Evil movies so bad that Capcom killed off Wesker to distance themselves from the hot garbage they themselves went out of their way to label non-canon material.
Look, the movie is gonna be bad, we all know that. But at least it'll be one of those so bad it's actually kinda good movies. As for this event quest? Not sure I care too much, I really don't want to look like Milla Jovovich. Unless Males get to be Tony Jaa.
This is a joke right, I mean could it be that the movie is so good that capcom did this also it would be nice to get one last surprise monster.
I know that movie will be bad, but I'm going to enjoy it like you can't imagine
No thanks
Cool I won't be playing this
Dafuq is this sht capcom
Such an amazing game does not match this crappy generic movie
AWESOMEEEE!!!!
The main thing is black diablos is the flagship of the movie
These niggas really collabing with themselves 💀
Who allowed this? And why?
Nice! Glad to know we get this instead of arch-tempered Blackveil or Shara Ishvalda. :(
No.
fuck no
Alguien vino despues del directo de masamune?
I am one of the few who is actually really looking forward to the movie but her face looks really uncanny. It's just off. Still awesome to see them actually still giving us content. I thought for sure that AT velkhana + MR layered armor would be the end (not counting the solo Safi update).
We could’ve had gore
There really trying to bring people back to this game they knows its ending and I don't want it to end 😕
I mean, I'll take it, but I'm not watching the movie
That movie is gonna be dogshit
For this collab I would love to outfit my Palico  like a little soilder give him a helmet, a flak vest with canteen, and a combat shovel as his weapon lol but I doubt that would happen
New update adds degloving to world
As a Dual Blade main with over 1300 hunts, I am sad. :(
Ahhhhhhh- everyone screaming!
Plot twist: this update adds Gore Magala.
Now seeing how good Milla Jovovich’s in-game model is in appearance just makes me question even more, why they didn't opt for a total CGI format for the movie.
*Just when you think iceborne is over, they come out with new content!*
Yo I've heard you like monster hunter...
Bro I hope it’s like the Witcher and we fight greater rathalos. Even if it’s just one quest with a diablos though still pretty badass!
That's such a bruh moment
Atleast were not getting a monster hunter the movie the game
This is going to be the only armor I will not craft in the game.
Best thing to come out of this movie: more game content
Where's tony jaa?
HELL NOOOOOOO
And they said "Final update".  I fucking love this game
If there's a new monster I'm in regardless
do we get a new monster ?
When you're such a great franchise that the only good collaboration you can have is with yourself.
Still can't believe this movie is going to be a real thing, that's what I dreamt of in 2007 and now it's real.  I bet it's gonna be ass.
Wow, wasn't expecting anymore new content and certainly not this.
Nah...I'm good. I don't need this in my game.
The cutscenes for this will probably be better then the movie lol
f-ck is this canon
Not gonna lie, I'm hyped by the event but I was never a fan of Milla :(
What does this even bring?
Woah a collaboration of monster hunter and monster hunter. Who could’ve guessed that?
I hate it, I hate it so much, but I'm going to enjoy Monster Hunter as I always had and probably have fun with this quest.
Please give us the Admiral's skin!
Of all the posiblitys why this one...
Monster hunter collab with monster hunter :D
Thats a cool outfit. Wonder when it’ll be layered.
where is the american military at?
Monster Hunter... collabing... with its own movie adaptation. *Inception*
Just like the witcher collab but much worse!
So do we get M14's???
WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?!
*cof*cof*"gore"*cof*cof*
I’m not surprised but all comments aside about the movie they really capture her model really well.   I’m still gonna watch since I rather judge my opinion after the movie. Plus I’m paying for it so 🤷🏻‍♂️
@fayenix @phemeto Hell yeah hype KAPPA
The collaboration we always wanted.
It's the game based off the movie based off the game based off the longwinded Ratchet and Clank reboot reference based off of someone who has no reason to still be reading this comment?
Me :ok im going to beat alatreon and fatalis then put the game down  Monsterhunter: u sure about that?!
No
Lmaoo nobody thinking about when they Said no more title updates. I think we getting more arch temp guys. Arch tempered monsters weren't considered title updates
This is the only quest I won't be doing.
No...just...no...
Still waiting for my Shadow of The Colossus crossover
Umm... Can we trade her in for Gore Magala? He's in the film.  Or Tony Ja at least? 😂
Im just imagining the Spiderman pointing at Spiderman meme
Does this make the movie technically canon?
Meta collaboration I wonder how good those dbs will be 🤣
Hmmm
The people at Monster Hunter knew we liked Monster Hunter so they had Monster Hunter do a collab with Monster Hunter
*N O*  just NO, a military gets isekai'd into MH then using fire db against Rathalos, Gore magala having eyes, using vehicles, using rocket launcher against a Diablos.. DO I NEED TO MENTION THE SINS MORE?   This collab's gonna be shitty
Monster hunter is reaching greater heights collarborating themselves with Monster Hunter Movie this is really getting crazy for me.
OMG THIS MILLA IS MAKING ITS WAY HERE 🤷‍♂️
I find it hilarious that Alice became a playable character in MHW, and not in any of the RE games lol  RE: 6 whole ass movies, and gets single costume reference worn by Jill in a non canon multiplayer spin off game.   MHW: Gets an entire quest with cutscenes, Voice acting, Actor Face, and playable status! For a movie that’s not officially out yet.   2020 sure is a Wild year
I find it hilarious that one of her Dual blades is just a carving knife
https://youtu.be/p9U4iTWTqxA  I've found a brand new best friend and it's me.
Man I hope the movie's good...
Capcom no.... why...
Nope
not sure if the movie will be watched more than the game will be played... or the game played more that the movie will be watched....
Gore magala for world?!
Holy shit I didn’t think we’d have a collab event for the movie
MONSTER HUNTER in Collaboration with... Monster Hunter, let that sink in, weird right
Lmao, ok.
Let me get that armor though lol
Let's go another quest guess I haven't beaten the game yet
Capcom, as much as you do an amazing job with Monster Hunter.... you *never* should have let Paul W.S. Anderson get this directing job. He destroys any chance of quality video game movies 😣
Does that mean the movie is canon?
Does that mean the event quest will be against a buffed up Rathalos?????????
No.
This is a very interesting turn of events. I hope we get some actual story in the quest just like the Witcher crossover event. Also I’m very curious on how the community each base monster in World and Iceborne. Now that the game is at its end, I’ve decided to make a survey on rating every base monster in World/Iceborne. Each respondent gets to rate each monster from 1-10. Each rating will correspond to the number of points the monster will get. I’ll hold the poll until December and I will post the results on every other social media platform I shared the link to. So let’s see who’s the best and who’s the worst! Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeL2GiAuDDs01GG30Qcjx7YPRxt2ZJHG723zgoPpInCCUzhqQ/viewform
No, absolutely not, cancel this. This is not a collaboration anyone wants
Meh if they had added Nerscylla and Gore Magala in-game, I would be hyped af
Bro if its mean more content than it's okay for me.
Alright I feel like we are missing a short event with great rathalos and goromgala
Gore Magalla appearing then huh?
I already prefer this than the actual movie, Honestly just replace the movie with this and we’d all be satisfied
Ya know, I was willing to give the film a shot, even if it looked like shit, because it was monster hunter, and I love monster hunter, but once I heard about how the director is a murderous piece of shit I cant on good conscious watch this movie. It looks awful, its plot sounds dumb and its director is a piece of dog shit on a hot sidewalk.
When you give yourself the Presidential Medal of Freedom
heh  that's more in the game at least
Don't you dare bring modern day tanks and rocket launchers to our beloved game.
So let me get this straight: you are collaborating with a movie series that is based on your video game series? What's next? Monster hunter the movie the game?
GORE MAGALA PLS !!!!
I'm 90% sure this collab will be better than the movie
Ah yes, monster hunter collabs with monster hunter, truly the crossover of the century
Wow that’s awesome would also love to see the Greater Rathalos too but highly doubt that would happen.
We need a collaboration With whoom we don't have anyone? Proof of a Hero starts playing
That's... strange, but any new content is welcome
Hum yes but actually no. The question is : Who is still playing MHW Iceborne ? 🤷‍♂️
Gore magala is in the movie so maybe....
I think this collab will be better than the film itself...and i know I'm not the only one :)
I wasn't expecting any more updates, MHW really is a gift that keeps giving.
Trying to recover from the bad rep the trailer got by hyping it up in game huh? Nice.
Holy shit it’s real.
Dunno how im supposed to see the movie when all the theaters are closed! But yeah this collaboration looks great!
Theirs a movie?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!! 💀
Such a shame the movie is being directed by a guy with zero talent.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Monster Hunter collaborating with MONSTER HUNTER I'VE BEEN WAITING THIS ALL MY LIFE Joke aside the skin is kind of looking badass though
I'm more hyped that we can get monster hunter language finally !
Looks like we’re not done with Iceborne just yet
This was unexpected.
Wtf?
Black Diablos with dual blades? Which is also my 3rd worst weapon in the game? God damnit, might as well start digging my grave now.
Capcom please stop... We already love you and you have already given us more content than we deserve ;_;
Woooooooo incrível 👏👏 conteúdo excelente gostei muito agora vou aproveitar mais nas jogatinas 👏👏👏😎 agora modo épico que venha mais
Oh no
I missed this game I forgot about it the day I had to kill a Alatreon in order to kill fatalis
So they basically collabed with themselves?     If only we get to see gore...
I'm more interested in that mixed bone x iron dual blade she got going on hmmmm
Please tell me we fight a giant rathalos 🙏
Bruh cmon give us something real. Not some lame collab quest nobody's going to like anyways promoting your awful movie adaptation. You decided to kill millions of people's favorite game for a switch exclusive. Die-hard mhw fans are sad. I am sad. Dont give up on this game. Please keep making grindable quests. I dont want to let this game go
Something tells me they should've pulled an ID software and just distanced themselves from the movie as soon as it was announced
I guess the dual blades will be fire element based on the movie, and they expect us to kill that b.diablos with it
I appreciate the effort but don't think I will hunt Diablos with fire DS
Que genial! Monster hunter haciendo una collab con monster hunter jaja. Es buenos saber que no dejaron olvidado el juego aún
Why tf would I want to look like Milla Jovovich
So Iceborne ISN’T over yet?
No tony jaa?
We have Milla in the Game... You know what we need too?          Gore Magala Reveal
If I dont get a gold gold gold crown rathslos i'll be livif
Olivia Jackson lost an arm to the negligence of Jeremy Bolton and Paul W.S. Anderson. I haven't gotten this expansion and I sure as hell won't now.
cool
What
I’m not gonna waste my money seeing a film we all know will be shit. Also I’d rather not give money to a scummy director that let multiple people die on his set when making these films.
I....I don’t know if I should or shouldn’t have expect this.
Ooooo
monster hunter x monster hunter great choice of collaboration when will you do stranger things or ninjago
That's cool and weird a bit weird lol
Okay, fair enough. It looks really good, but just a little weird
nice another layered armour to add to my collection
LMFFFFFAOOOOOOO SPIT THE FOOD OUTTA MY MOUF

The council awards you, a singular yike.
Monster Hunter: Last update is Fatalis, Enjoy the hunt   Aslo Monster Hunter: NEW QUEST IN DECEMBER

Give us the rest of the Arch Temepred elder dragons instead of this crap..
Fucking hell... Does this now mean that the MH Movie is Canon?..
No
This is amazing!
Wow to think all this time the hunters had their own language had really just been translated through us because we play at the hunter itself I really wish they would elaborate more on the lore of Monster Hunter
😭😭😭NNNNNNNNnnnnnnnoooooo just swore I just no😭😭😭😭
It’s not the end of the World yet!!!
I can't believe their actually collabing the movie to the actual game...
Still waiting on Jurassic Park x Monster Hunter
