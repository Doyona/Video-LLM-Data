Only to not add it in the next games
I bought this game on the switch thinking I would get to play AFC Richmond everywhere I went. Imagine my disappointment. What is the quote? It's the hope that kills you?
What's next, the Halifax Highlanders from Goon in NHL, I'd love that!
EA Sports, I'm in the game!  Jason Sudeikis, 2022
AND HERE HE IS EVERYWHERE YOUR MOTHER ROY KENT!
EA pls add it on FC 25
Why'd they show Beard but not add him?
Jan Maas is the most cringe player
Rare EA W
Should’ve kept it in fc25
Bring this club from the bottom league to the champion of the premier league is everyone dream.. 😭
Add the back in fifa 25 please 🙏
So wheres that zlatan from temu.
AYayayay❤

Roy Kent is the best
Trent crimm. the indepentant.

I Hope that ea make in a Next ea fc Game afc Richmond back
Put it in fc 26
pongan el fifa 23 en la store otra vez!
Fritsch Knoll
0:07 Rooney’s acting skills haven’t improved I see 🤣
0:16 That part is the most hilarious and loyal to the series in this whole spot 😂. ROY KEEEENT, ROY KEEEENT!
That transition from the Cinematic to the 2010 iPhone graphics got me rolling
But why we didn't see a story mod on FC games as FIFA 17 to 19 make some story mode it's make more fun
Fifa x ted lasso
ADD RICHMOND TO FC 25 PLEASE I BEG YOU 😢
Why isn't he in fc 24 I want to play as him or under him please ea make this right in fc 25
PLEASE BRING HIM TO FC25
there was a problem communicating with the fifa Ut servers when opening pcack Anyone else’s?
We need Him!!
Wayne Rooney, doing Ted Lasso Promo.
Can we have ted lasso in fc25
This video sums up AFC Richmond Perfectly
They should at ted lasso to ea fc 24 and when ea fc 25 comes out
I want to buy this just because its afc richmond.
ADD THIS BACK FOR FC 24
Is he acully in the game
I’ve never bought a FIFA game before & probably never will again. Ted Lasso ftw!
Glad Nate is not in it.
This is sickkk
Why isnt it on the switch😢
Maybe EA should add Team Shaolin in EAFC 24 😂... That would be funny.
Uhhhhh what happened to the graphics lol?
Please tell me they will also be in fifa 24
Might be actually worth buying
FOOTBALL IS LIFE!!!!!!!!!
I remember this, even i was embarrassed
Is Coach Beard only available on Next Gen?
End rascim
I’m only here to stand by 100% 🇩🇪 Team mens Germany all the way & The best is yet to come
I’m buying the game for this reason and this reason only
AFC Richmond is why I bought this game!
Pena que não tem a torcida chamando ele de bronheiro
devcro
We need them in FC 24 too 😢
Yeah in the beginning people thought it was sick but now everybody probably forgot about it and doesent care anymore
Not played a FIFA game since the original on Megadrive/Genesis. This is about to change. I KNOW I'M LATE TO THE PARTY, BUT I STILL MADE IT
Will AFC Richmond be available on fifa 24 ??
Ohhh
The best thing in Fifa ❤
just watched the whole show and im gonna keep all these players and make them super good and destroy every team on the prem especially west ham
Wait I haven’t seen beard in game!!!
Fifa 24
Armenia woman national football team
esport not for under 13 this game
Banned Ukriane
Armenia men national football team cyprus slovenia slovakia
Any chance if we get this in the game can we get harchester united? More history and all round better show
Still available in ea sports 24?
Cringe
NINTENDO SWITCH????????
Richmond Til We Die !!!
This is the only reason I’m buying the game
unbelievable how fifa still looks like the 2010 Version of 2k
Ted is such a wholesome human ❤ at the end when rebecca cried at the airport it shows how much he has changed every character, this show is lovely
am playing nate's west ham lol
Why does this have Xbox360 graphics...?
Lol... funny enough, I had dream that they will do this 😂
I'm buying
Why is this comment section so positive? Is EA running bots or deleting the negative comments?
unbelievably based.
Wow I mean it makes sense they got Ted Lasso because the graphics in the game are as good as season 3
Yeaaah baybeeee
Where is Coach Beard and Nate the Great?
Now for EA Sports to have a Wrexham ad like this too... with Ryan & Rob...
Gonna be fun, but I'm not gonna progress much with Richmond because I will always be playing hyper aggressively whenever my control goes to Roy Kent.
WHY CANT I GET TED NOW
I love you ted💙😇
Ted Lasso! Now add blue lock and giant killing
legit the only reason why i bought it
0:15, Woah jamie seems different
EA Plees lige iran
“EA Sports. I’M in the game!”
I just started watching ted lasso and im proud I did
will they be an official team?
Coach Lasso with the Foams
*Ted Lasso is perfect!*
Where is coach Beard (In game)
Ted Lasso isn't going to change the rubbish quality of the game... These fans are seriously hyped over the same waste of money but with a different cover slapped onto it... You can please anyone these days...
Is it just me or Have the graphics gone down?
Ill just use my Albacete Balompie team to whoop AFC Richmond
: D
Football is Life!! ⚽️
Can you still get them?
Futbol is Life!!!
Wrexham vs AFC Richmond I’m down
Where is nate?
Whelp. It looks like I’m gonna learn about soccer because of Ted Lasso
I have never played EA Sports, but I will probably start now. As Roy Kent might say, "F*** yeah! Go Richmond!"
Is afc richmond in switch?
Welcome ted lasso EA Sports FIFA 23 ted lasso is the best football manager ever
Wow. This went from a commercial to a fully realized franchise
Never touched a fifa game ever. I might now. 🤠
Yessir
Zava gotta be added now
“Yeah, you sounded like the guy Ted.” honestly that’s my favourite part of the whole trailer 😂
No idea who this guy is or why i should care lol.  But that being said, career mode in fifa 23 is the best i have ever played.
I want to buy this game now!!!
I’ve never played FIFA. I’ve never before felt any need nor desire to play FIFA. I am now going to get FIFA
I had no idea about this. Gotta buy it now
Wow terrible graphics. Is this on a Sega Genesis? Barf
Banter had to be the sponsor
If you’re gonna add ted lasso then you need to add Ryan Reynolds to the game not just the voice
Very rare FIFA W
please EA, bringback OLD GEN to PC
...why?
AFC Richmonds in Ultimate Team omg make it happen
The only redeemable part of Fifa 23
GOOD
Ficou excelente! Meu sonho. FIFA23, FIFA futebol  no Apple Arcade. It turned out excellent! My dream.  FIFA23, FIFA football on Apple Arcade.
Ur telling me he's face is on fifa but real coaches don't have a face in fifa
Is that a Journey mode
EA, do you have any intention of fixing the bug where referees wear similar colours to one of the teams?
amazingggggg
Trent Crimm... The Independent.
I Will Buy the game when Ryan Raynolds  appear.
THE TED LASSO THE REAL BUBBA! AFC RICHMOND IRON SHEIK CLASS!! WEST HAM THE BIGGEST JABRONI SINCE HULK HOGAN!!!
Football is life
Omg I didn't even know they're on here. I guess I need to buy the game now.
Immediately started Career mode with AFC Richmond.
This ones gonna be a collectors item...
Buena, gran serie, saludos desde Perú 🇵🇪
Ted Lasso is one of the best shows ever made
Destroy the game, that you play Pro Club with the computer, you want to run fast, you have to press triangle, but what's the problem, that if you want to run fast and press triangle, it is handed to you, and that way you can't run the whole game. In short, I deleted the game
There should be mode where you can recreat the show like the Journey
This is another reason why Jason Sudeikis is one of my favorite SNL actors I can recall. It’ll be interesting to see what Jason in real life will do in his acting career starting in 2023 now that he will appear in FIFA23 video game and going on 48 years of age. Go Coach Jason Sudeikis!!
I am not a gamer. I do not follow soccer at all. However, Ted Lasso and every single other character on that show, are absolute treasures and THIS is amazing. So awesome.
😂amazing 👌 EA
Having AFC Richmond in the Game is the only reason why I am thinking about buying the game
worst game
Ted Lasso being added automatically made FIFA 23 the best games in the FIFA franchise
LETS GOOOOO TED LASSOOOOO
Magnificent.
👍
Cancellate anche i commenti...
Borat?
Make sure his water has no bubbles in it!!!
Der, der das spiel programmiert ist 7x24h unter drogeneinfluss!!
When coach getting added
Fifa 23 is the worst ever 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
They should make a special commentary featuring Roy Kent and Ted Lasso
HE'S HERE, HE'S THERE!
They add the club that isnt real form some bad series but dont add some great clubs form europe
Hehe cute commercial. "oooh! did i sound like the guy?!"
EA Sports,  Am in the Game!  🎮
Miller in fifa
Roy Kent’s appearance. He here he there he’s every fooking where Roy Kent Roy Kent
Has he played any Scottish side?
Ted Lasso belongs in FIFA 23
0:43 is coach beard only in UT not in the career mode? i am using ted lasso in career mode but never see coach beard in the team
Liked immediately I saw Ted lasso
Thank you
"yeah, you sounded like the guy, Ted" 😂
これは嬉しすぎる やりたい
Wow. Was not expecting this. Good job on the animation!
No he jugado al fifa en mi vida y me voy a gastar 60 pavos solo para jugar el modo carrera con este equipo
Is that may possible to add classical team and club please?
Crazy that this all started with Jason doing ads for NBC and now hes in a video game.
Ive never heard of this man 😐
For the next one. The Rock 🤨
OH GOD I LOVE IT!
Only for this, this game is worthy of play
Amazing
Last FIFA
Ea sports your bank account is in the game .
FIRE!!!
Y los Cuervos Cuando ? Con Chava Iglesias
Not adding antony from ajax to man utd real face ? Really keep generic face ?
Wonder 👍👍💯💯
The show became trash after season 1. It's like they already finished the ideas
How has no one mentioned Coach beard!!??
I wish Arlo white was the voice in FIFA, it was an absolute joy with him commentating
Hi
Love it Fifa Ted Lasso Trailer
Gotta say this is the best thing to come after FIFA09.
I have always wanted fifa my whole time because cant afford💶 it...let me go youtube watch gameplay📺.... Thank you for another year of History history 🎮
L because you put this and not other important things how:mode career online,Deleted icons,deserved ratings for players,Second division in other leagues and more.   L porque vos pones esto y no pones otras cosas importantes como: modo carrera online,iconos borrados,medias merecidas,segunda división en ptras ligas y mas.
😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
Lets introduce FIFA 13
Jason Sudeikis in FIFA? Wow.

Im glad they put Jason Sudeikis in the game
God bless to the 1% who see this comment
instant goty
Мультфильм
It would be funny if they implement that Ted is in a fifa game in the new season.
This just might be the reason I’m buying fifa this year
please unlock game on steam, 😔
This what we want
Just for this - I have to get it
The best African team is not included 😱 Racism is through video games too Shame on you EA 👎
You can had him but not legendary managers?
When i saw a man with moustache that knows nothing i literally thought it was Chris Kamara.
Paying 90 EUR for game which doesnt work and i need to play IT and search the web what to do! srsly!!! give me back my money!
dream team harchester United next
Everyone excited.. Now... let's see what happens when it's released lol... like fifa 22 1.3 /5 stars seems legit lol
lMAO 😂 😜🤣
please teach me how to use this team in career mode
wow really....
Please remove them for career mode because it absolutely ruins the realism
Xbox Series S 1440p Not ? seriously EA?
Im buying this now hahahah
We’re still not buying 😂.
Well what happened to the real Brazil 🇧🇷 team in fifa 23 ????
Y aquí empieza la aventura del rayo metrayo y ted ba-lasso
Y los cuervos de nuevo Toledo pa cuando?
ronaldo dont deserve a pace downgrade
Gazza
This would be the only reason I get this…if I end up getting it. Did not expect this! Wow!
WELL I AM DEFINITELY BUYING FIFA
W FIFA W EA

EA GET BACK CAMP NOU STADIUM
Bruh... Now I gotta buy fifa and I didn't want too
Arteta Arsenal player not real !!!
Uncle Ted is the GOAT. 💯
I LIKE HOW YOU ADDED PLAYERS AND THEIR SYMBOLS OF TEAMS THEY PLAY FOR LIKE THE LIGA 1 FROM PERU ❤ AND BEING ABLE TO SELL THEM TO EUROPEAN/NORTH AMERICAN TEAMS
That's awesome man the ea brought harmony to the game ... Loved it.... "EA sports to the game"
sick!
👏🏻🧠⚽️
WOOOOOOOOW
Mi primer partido será fc Richmond vs Bayern Munich en el FIFA 23 y modo Carrera dirigiendo..
All these guys sound payed to say all that…😂😂
This is actually pretty cool! Very smart cross over!
I will not play the game from FIFA 16, there is no interest in the Italian League
The graphics it's very bad in game
Efootball is good
Dónde está club de cuervos
Well played Sir's
Quem é esse?
O melhor técnico 🤞
This game is BS here’s my 1 star experience - I bought FiFa 23 as a preorder when you preorder it it said it’s compatible with XBox One after I purchase it it says not compatible and it says Xbox series x. EA sports I want my money back and we have proof.
Falto club de cuervos
LOVE FROM KURDISTAN   THANK YOU EA I AM PROUD
Ok I order the game !
Where is version Nintendo Switch 🤔 EASport 💩💩💩🤫🤫
Next…sign Alex hunter and Santiago munez to Richmond!!!!
who is ted lasso
Well played EA. Well played.
🤩🤩🤩
Instead of bringing this guy you guys should bring sir alex ferguson
I'm buying the game just for this
Copy paste
Wie geil Hahahaha
If EA makes this game available on GeForce Now I'll probably end up buying it because Ted Lasso is one of my favorite shows of all time.
Awesome EA
All good except it looks like it’s for the PS2
Ted lasso is amazing and yeah but why is there a entire trailer about him?
Now do Chava Iglesias and Cuervos de Nuevo Toledo.
Can we use him in FUT ?
thank you ea!
❤️
Lol how hard they try but this won't save the game. Fifa is the same for years now with updated teams and minimalistic changes. And for that 60 € every year. I'm out for 2 years now and I'm not missing anything
Wait, this is real?
This is amazingggg!!
WHO TF IS TED LASSO?
Bro I wish they did the football is life celebration;(
Big bruh
It's what we deserve tbh
Can't wait to trash West Ham
Ojala no salgan con que nomás se va a poder jugar en la versión de ps5 😐😤
What a great addition I finished TED LASSO Yesterday and I really enjoyed it It's was a great coach and a great team and the series was completed CAN not waiting for s03  Thank you @EASPORTS
Who is he?
THIS SHOULD BE THE NEW OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN STORY MODE.... drop the rest of that dross you've been doing
can people please share this comment with everyone who plays fifa and EA, EA should get decibel Bellini to record his Legendary speak for fifa 24 and forever
The best series of all time.
Nice
Lmao fifa is becoming a straight up joke, we literally beg them for years for meaningful changes and upgrades as their focus has shifted entirely to FUT. They losing multiple big name leagues and teams, so many generic players and teams now, and to make up for it, we get fantasy teams
هل فيفا22انتهت
For mobile
On this basis you can add captain Tsubasa and his team also. 😂
The ratings are a flop
it's available for season match online?
MAKE FIFA MOBILE GET CAREER MODE AND FUT ASWELLL PLSSS
I was really going to avoid FIFA but with Ted Lasso it's a most buy
Football is life !
Richmond vs Leeds United will be the first game I will play
Football is life
كل شوية تحطو لاعبين اسرائليين fake your 😉
Hope they take out the stamina bug they put on Liverpool. Absolutely ridiculous.  Can change tactics to anything, and you will come out half time with less than half stamina.
They are desperate lmao
This is fifa’s way of not making any improvements
Can we use him as a coach for another team
I hope you can use them in seasons
HAHA good job guys!!
Adesso voglio pure Oronzo Canà!
Who is this game made for cause its certainly not for people who watch or play football
Made in Canada and Romania lmao what the f do Canada and Romania know about football
Canal do Fred Vasquez lançou uma série sobre esse time ,bem antes de ir pro Fifa
Football is life
Dear EA Sports, can you give IShowSpeed on Fifa 24 cover?
Can you use them in player career mode @EA sports FIFA
Have they actually added a fictional team to the career mode?
If Richmond is in Fifa, I'm buying it.
NICEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Meanwhile talents like Musiala, Tchouameni, Adeyemi, Hlozek still have terrible generic faces…
EA can you please add Sidemen all star  and youtube all star it will be so cool  plus is the last fifa please added i will love it
you would have preferred to put more energy into the career mode instead of into such a dumb....
Dany Rojas! Danny Dany rojaaas!
EA know how to ruin a good game
Fifa 14: the fancier update  Pre-order now
now theyve done this itd be a crime to not have mile bassett in game
متى موعد صدور fifa 23 ???
Will it be available on Nintendo's version?
Danny Rocha Danny Rocha
Guys i want to see the show is it good
Who's Ted Lasso?
The best thing fifa has done in years
Will this be my first FIFA since 2006? it could be
my home town going round the world  Richmond ftw
FIFA 23  Good Very Nice ok
Glad they kept that dirty rotten traitor Nate out the game.
que es esto?
Football is life 😁😃😃
Where’s İsmail Kartal Fifa?
This looks wack or is just me tf
if those shoes are in the game props ea
Waist lmao
Please make pro clubs better Less bugs please
From the graphic it's like Fifa18?!
They made a full trailer for a manager? 😂
Am…am I buying my first Fifa game…
Ted Lasso Dlc?😂
Oh nah this team will win the champions League!!!
Still can't believe that Ted and AFC Richmond actually will be in FIFA 😁
So amazing!  😀
I’m surprised EA didn’t charge me to view this lol
Please tell me I can play career mode with this team :)
This graphics looks so 2010ish
Bs
Lol... Maybe this means they'll actually put a MODICUM of effort into the career modes this time round... One can only hope.
Дани Рохос, Дани Рохос, Дани Рохос 🔝🔝🔝
lol here we go
He is like Ter stigen 🤣🤣 with mostach
I really believe that EA will deliver more to the game in the upcoming years without the company of FIFA. I think fifa standards is preventing EA from making such great ideas like this! WHAT A HUGE W FOR EA. definitely we'll make a career mode with AFC Richmond 👏🏽
The graphics are garbage but I like Ted lasso
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.       ..
FOOTBALL IS LIFE
Eyyyy they got Rooneyyyyyyyyy
Career Mode with AFC Richmond!!! 🎉🎉🎉
The should have put "football is life" at the end.
Fútbol es vida.
AFC Richmond Vs. Wrexham AFC is the first game I am doing. Love Ted Lasso, and I love RR and RM.
Ted Lasso is comming soon in FIFA 23!!!!
So it’s steering away from real football now after all these years 😂
Okay, is this real? I might actually have to buy a FIFA game for once.
I choose you buzz lightyear. 😆, just saying. I don't like sports as I used to, it's just a boring thing, why do you humans try it or whatever. I'm interested in fantasy like superman and Godzilla. Those can be my best fantasy stuff, I love centaurs and dragons. Yup, that's me.
I hate the world
I don’t care for soccer at all but if I owned a current gen console I’d buy this game for Ted Lasso alone
Having Ted Lasso in the game is crazy. But to have a Hollywood actor in the game is just whole another level of crazy! Huge dub from EA
Story about real player<< Ted Lasso🤑🤑🤑
Who is he ?
So there in ultimate team?
Cant wait ❤😮😂😂haha
Graphics literally haven't improved since about fifa 14
Me and the boys buiyng Messi to Richmond
Ted Lasso got me into football, I was hyped seeing him in the game but then I saw you can play as Richmond!! Gonna be my first fifa game and I am hyped
Nah bro actors in football 😒 it's a great show but this is bad and it's just my opinion  many footballers aren't here many teams leagues and they bring actors
Wearing his drippy air Jordan’s 😎😎😎
¿para cuándo a los cuervos negros de nuevo toledo?
Reminds me of SNL…painfully unfunny.
When Ted Lasso puts everyone in his team in the wrong positions....coming soon to Murs Gaming Channel.  It's like Erling Haaland in goal.
I can hardly wait to bring this team to Champions League glory 😁
Oooohhhhhhh!!!!! Football is life!!!! I belive!!!!! ❤️
People who have never seen the show won't know who this guy is and why is in the game.
Is it another story in FiFA with ted??? Omfg!!!!
La selección colombiana sigue en fogueo con selecciones muy malas mientras que otras selecciones se enfrentan con equipos de categoría por eso es que el fútbol colombiano no da una en compromisos internacionales
LAST EA FIFA GAME LETS GOOOOOO
Football is life!
If  you can create for us career mod or tournaments in fifa 16 mobile it could be enough for my satisfaction, i love fifa 16 mobile
Waiting for the day you lot decide to do something other than reskins for career mode.
TAKE THIS W
So if you play Richmond vs West Ham, Nate the Great will appear as West Ham coach instead of Moyes?
This is so weird!  Are they an extra non-league team that only shows up in cup draws, are they lined up to be promoted into a particular league after your first season or do they take the place of a team in the league E.A. couldn't get the licence for?!  Are they in career mode by default or do you have the option to add and remove them from each playthrough?! 😯😂😀🤘
This is so dumb... I don't think anyone in the UK even watches this show.
So u can do things like this But not one new efl ground well done
Oh my goooooood I can't believe it!!!
Who is be
Football is life!!
Have to admit , this is a really classy touch.
Roy Keane is back on the pitch. Lol
they should also add Scott STERLING the keeper who can only save with his head.
The graphics look bad lol
No way!!!! Unbelievable🥹
Roy!!!!❤
I might actually buy a fifa game now 😂
The guy replying Ted is wholesome.
messi with variation st and cf, urgent change
The only well used cameo I've seen in an AD for a long time.
Poi ci sono io che non so chi è e perché ha tutto sto successo 🥲😅
I’m buying solely because of AFC Richmond
If you work for EA sports I hate you.
Does this one have the option to have as much players in the box as you chose to in tactics. I mean when I set for 3 players in the box to actually be 3 players in the box not like 6 and then the opposide team could easily score a goal because I am open? You get it? I mean like when I chose so my  40 defence striker will stay forward to actually stay forward and not get in defence mode wasting stamina and not blocking the ball to go inside my net because he is a striker and does not have good defence? I am asking if this one works like it is supposed to work.
Добавьте Амкал и Тудротс
We need shaolin soccer team noww
Classic Roy Kent quote.
I think lazy EA dev team hit a gold mine with this , go give them your money muppets ;) next year they dont really need to update the roasters even
Gameplay não melhora, bugs não corrigem, ai trás essa bomba pra tentar amenizar o jogo podre que ficou
It's been a while since I bought a FIFA game and I'm afraid it will take more than this to make me do so again.  However, I am looking forward to season 3 of Ted Lasso👍
I'm so done with the direction that EA are taking FIFA...
EA for the W! Can't wait to grab this 😊
Ngl first time hearing ted lasso and start watching the series and god, i must say its beautiful
I actually may get FIFA 23 solely to play as Richmond... good move in my opinion.
Ea pode pegar todo meu dinheiro, agora tá merecendo
I hope he is in ut. I am gonna keep the entire time. 😆 🤣
Thank you
The only good thing EA has done.
Hahahah am actually watching the series😁😁
This makes game unrealistic.. why do i need this?
Who tf is this guy
dang
Fifa 23 and there character models are still the worst in the business 😂
Big w
Ted Lasso vs. Sean Dyche, let's go! 😆
ea did something good and fun?
Now i know wholl lead my FUT Team this year
is that Hercules???
🤣🤣🤣fifa les meilleurs pour leur publicité le gameplay zéro 🤣🤣
I want the classic chant of "wan*er" for ted lasso
Great news, something different for a change, love it! I'd love to see some classic teams added, imagine being able to play fifa 23 but with previous seasons squads, amazing
Great news, something different for a change, love it! I'd love to see some classic teams added, imagine being able to play fifa 23 but with previous seasons squads, amazing
FOOTBALL IS LIFE!!!!
So this is the only team on fifa with manager and assistant on the bench in-game?
Yess
Ea sports I am in the game
Ted lasso🔥🔥
Football is life
I have never bought a FIFA game but looks like this will be the one!
Imagine having a manager rivalry with nate in the season
Hashtag FC next please 😂
I didn't watch Ted Lasso, so I thought it was Pep at first lol
Please give the opportunity to use Ted in a career as a coach in another team and championship) Simulate his career path, how he goes to promotion and so on
Omg finally a change in a fifa game
EA i really love you 😘
Club de cuervos es mejor
W Ea W Ted Lasso ❤❤
Best collab of the year 😂❤
Yes, good.. but i wanna Led Tasso
Ted Lasso is amazing
The best fifa news we've ever had!
Idk, am I the only one that's not excited about this lol...
ok this is pretty cool
Bro I never got a FIFA before. I guess it's gonna change now.
not a fan of EA, but this is the next level of marketing haha
Football is life!
why is ted lasso?
I’m buying FIFA literally just for this now.
I hope if I perform poorly long enough he becomes Led Tasso
Graphics look like 2016 version
You can’t be serious. Y’all are still making this TRASH?!😂😂😂😂 ok muggles show yourselves, who’s buying this trash fire? The game has been the same for over a DECADE now. PATHETIC
futbol es vida
Nice
Yeah but where's Keeley?
I just bought it because of this
Now I really might come back to FIFA only bc of Ted Lasso being in the game….HE’S IN THE GAME Y’ALL
Will he be able to take Liverpool to win champions ?
buying my first Fifa game fr what a W
**sigh** as someone who binge watched Ted Lasso in the span of two weeks, I feel giddy, genuine excitement, and I’d ABSOLUTELY buy this game.   HOWEVER, knowing what EA truly is, this is nothing but a joyless cash grab to make people forget that they haven’t updated anything since 2017, that the FIFA series is just online gambling, and that ANYONE who willingly buys this series yearly are completely brain dead and need therapy and interventions  Also, EA if you’ve read this, please add Nate The Great to West Ham United FC  🤞
who would of thought that Tom from Derek would become a professional footballer
fifa 23 going to be the best fifa of all time
About time everyone noticing that FIFA is the best EA game. Always has been.
You made my dreams come true. Only team I’ll use! MY CLUB! AFC RICHMOND!!! We’re Richmond and we’re proud! Could cry rn!
Is it me or the guy looks like jason sudeikis
ted baby! hes back!
just finished my preload  download of the game can't wait til it comes out in full.  big ups 👍👍👍
how i imagine the muiltiversus trailer will go
"I'm in the game" -Ted Lasso
Add Roy Kent or I riot
Never owned a FIFA game…might have to now😊
Everyone’s excited until they tell them it’s a $10000000 DLC with each player as a microtransaction and the air in the ball is an additional $17700 😂
FOOTBALL IS LIFE!
... doesn't sound like Sudeikis
Why does he look like Jason Sudeikis
YESSS YESSS YESS YESSS YESSSSSSSS SO ICONC
Ok and
If EA can see this, thank you❤️
Good, now I can say there is something different to a sports game. I don't play them, cause they feel like cash grabs, but these games should have lots of story, cutscenes, and a fun well developed plot to catch the atention of the people who can clearly see that sports games are nothing but yearly sport cods/ cash grabs. Nice addition, even though I'm not aware who Ted Lasso is.
Miles Davis's trumpet 😂😂
Who is this guy? I don't know him
Amazing
Didnt realize crying bc some ones arm brushed u slightly was a challenge
Lmao what is Hercules doing in fifa
2 years late but cool nonetheless
Team Big Head Bob 2023?? LOVE THIS!!!
thank you EA ❤🌹very nice
joke of the year 🤣🤣🤣.
Coach beard is in the game!!!
Jesse Marsh *chokes on Cornflakes* 🤣 💙💛🤍
this is awesome, thanks to all the team of EA Sport, for this, you are the best!
Is that like Alex hunter but manager version
EA Sports, if you're gonna partner with Ted Lasso- The "Ted Lasso Dance" better be a goal celebration or it's a massive L altogether.
Another step to be the Fortnite of sports game
What team is replaced
nathan being left out, like in the emmys,
Remember when FIFA used to be a football game?
Do caraleo
wonder if this means Nate joined West Ham as well when playing as Richmond or Ted Lasso
Totally dope!
Where is club de cuervos?
Now I am considering buying this game
IS THIS THE START OF FIFA DLC. IMAGINE...   BLUE LOCK DLC
GRACIAS EA!!!❤❤❤ I’m preordering
This is brilliant
EA, this is the birthday present I needed, but didn’t know I wanted
nice soccer update
This trailer gives me alex hunter vibes. Love it!
I couldn't believe it. Fantastic
Literally Selhurst Park
This is fire
Never heard of that guy, who is it?
Idk dude
Oiiii??? 😳😳😳
1000
I am very excited to play the game
wahab  hates this show
Who?
Trash!
I hate this bc I had convinced myself to not buy the game
Who is this guy?
Believe it!
Didnt EA lose the FIFA license
Please make the gameplay actually playable this year, thanks
🔥🔥🔥
This is the best things EA has done since like fifa 17
🔥🔥🔥
A rare W for EA this year✋🏾
this might be the best thing EA had added hopefully fifa 23 will be just as good as fifa 12-15
idk who he is
Wrexham vs AFC Richmond every day!!
Mahsa Amini 🇮🇷🥲
Z
Dont care
I hope the Richmond players are in UT.
WREXHAM?????????????????????
Football is life!
Was gonna start on ultimate team but now I have to do a Richmond career mode
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Ted Lasso is amazing… but I still refuse to buy another EA game. I mean look at the graphics and movement! Geez! We’re back in 2015.
Wait a minute... EA actually did something good?!?!
You just made a me purchase because  of this. Otherwise its just the same game for the last 3 years and EA you know it.   TED LASSO saved fifa 23
where´s Mike Basset?
cringe
60 days for Qatar 2022  🇶🇦
So this means they will be adding Inazuma 11 right?
EA shaking their maney maker😅
Football is life 🫶
EA were to busy putting this c nt in the game, that's why we've to wait until next year for celtic Park and ibrox.
Who???
EA24
Awesome
Amazing
As someone who has never seen the show what are they bringing in, is it a new game mode?
FIFA aren’t playing any games this season
Finally we have this in game thanks ea gods
Semplicemente stupendo🔥🔥
After BF2042 I thought I’d never forgive you. I don’t even like football, but I loved the show so much that I need to play it. Brushing up my skills until the release.
Don’t understand ? What is this craps ?? 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ Why don’t you model the L1 (🇫🇷) stadiums and teams, but teams that don’t exist?
Ted Lasso? That's some very weird casting. But yeah, it's EA marketing after all.
Af
Should be playing against Chelsea not City, stop condoning small clubs
Err, doesn't matter much when the gameplay is garbage.
The. Gameplay. Is. Beyond. Rubbish.
👍👍
Believe
Use them against crystal palace
The final fifa welp we enjoyed and hated this game it’s a fitting end to a classic
It’s better then Volta
HUGE W🎉
Well thats it, im buying it
instead of this bring crossplay to pro clubs
Fifa is not football.
Oh thank you! EA I take so much bad stuff I have said about you
They got this clown for the trailer lol
FIFA is life!
Can´t wait! Football is life
Müll oder nicht
What a video 🔥🔥 Loving the edit
So it’ll be available for career mode such as playing as richmond fc??
Futbol is life 😂🔥
The happiest I've been since fifa 17.. thank you
Who again?
oh a multitude of gameplay issues? oh no brazilian league license? oh boy let's just really quick add ted lasso from the hit tv series ted lasso
Pls someone explain why this guy is now on fifa
Wait can someone explain who this guy is?? Completely lost
I know switch version wont get Ted Lasso  Eat dirt Ea👿
This is rare and awesome
Dani rojas dani rojas
uff
who is that? (i have a feeling ill be killed)
who is he?
Good.
Will this finally get me to buy a fifa game?!?!?!
they can put the Dt of cuervos F.C. please
This is an absolute farce. The years we’ve spent campaigning to get the national league added to the game, only for them to turn it down so they can add fictional teams that don’t exist. Never seen the show, and from the looks of it they’re an Aldi Crystal Palace.  👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
I’m buying this just for Richmond,
More gimmicks to mask the awful gameplay 😮‍💨
It’s probably gonna be for next gen
Ea W
Having Ted Lasso in the game is crazy.  But to have a Hollywood actor in the game is just whole another level of crazy!  Huge dub from EA🙌🏻
Who is Ted Lasso ?
Yessssssssssssssss❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Big fan of Ted lasso. thanks EA, heaven knows y'all tried.
Nice FIFA 23
EA just sold FIFA 23 to me. This is amazing!!!
Who tf is this?
Football continues it's decline as Americans take more interest
🔥🔥🔥
Great, this is my favorite series!) It’s just scary to think that I might not live to see the release of this game since I’m from Ukraine and Putin is bombing my city😥
That is legendary 😭😭😭😭😭😭 what a way to bow down. FIFA 23 will go down as the greatest. I cannot wait for month end
LEEESSSSSSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Should’ve done Will Pharrell 😭😭😂
Who is this guy ? Outside the uk no one knows him.
what the...
That's it
Dani Rojas Rojas, Daaanny Rojaass
No freaking way! Coolest thing ever! OMG!!!!
Yesssssss. A trailer for the best Manager. Need to make sure he is my ultimate team manager
Who is he??
The first W for EA in a loooooong time. Still not a reson to buy it. At least to me…
I honestly don’t get this. It’s a complete shambles really. What makes us angry is that this will probably be available on release day, but you make us wait all the way until January to get any newly promoted club’s stadiums that should be there from day one. Can also guarantee there won’t be an Antony game face, or a Darwin game face, or Ten Hag’s game face yet we get Ted Lasso?! Disappointed EA.
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😂😂😂😂😂😂🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Just add sir alexfurteson
Thank you EA but I’m still wondering why
Admit it ! That's huge! Football is life !!
YES! Thank you EA!
so they do this instead of acfually makimng career mode better
I hate fifa games, but I really love Ted Lasso. I haven't played FIFA since FIFA07, so maybe when this one's on sale I might tried it, just because of FC Richmond
Rare W EA
wahnsinn
who's this ted lasso guy?
O, thank you, EA ❤️
Love ted lasso ! Cant wait for this 😁
If it weren't for Ted Lasso, Americans wouldn't know what football is. 😘
Butifual Video
War ja klar dass es irgendwann kommt
FIFA has always given us what we want, thanks to ea sports.. u guys are the best. Please do not allow groups of people, who can never be satisfied.. sway you.
Sold take my money
Add Sean dyche and Jon brady
Who tf is ted lasso
What the hell is going on?
I never bought a copy of FIFA since 1996... Guess I might just get this one, because, Ted!!!! 🤣
Know add Santiago Muñez from Goal plz 🙏🏼
So…we can have a fictional team and a fictional manager in 23, but almost zero changes to career mode, no facescans for a number of high profile players and teams, certain important national teams not included??  *sigh* at least there’s cross play i guess
These ea concepts man… flash back Adam Johnson official trailer soon
EA W?
Y’all didn’t change anything for the ps4 version
q
Nicely done, EA!
I think I speak for all English ppl when I say we don’t care
will the stadium be added also
They should have Richmond players in ultimate team at the end of the year
wheres nate the great?
Will make for an unusual career save. Definitely be playing it.
Yes! Career mode with Richmond and Lasso
New szn 🐐🔥
I can't take a guy who uses the word "soccer" serious.
I was hoping they'd be in fifa
❤️🔥❤️
Unexpected but not unwelcome 👀
Add As Roma, Atalanta Calcio, Lazio, Napoli, Olympiakos, not Ted Lasso.
No clue who this is anyone else?
Football is life! Love this!
Who else’s dad showed them ted lasso
Not gonna lie am very happy to see this lol
that was awesome!!!!!
ALL WE ASKED FOR WAS TO GIVE THE LOWER LEAGUE GK ACTUAL KIT
English fans and commentators malding rn. A rare W for EA and true football fans alike
Led tasso
Omg, I made him as a manager caracter in fifa 22
Finally, a real reason to buy FIFA
EA did good by including Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond.  EA did bad with the graphics.  The player's model looks cartoonish.
Who's more of a bad boy on the pitch,  Roy Kent or Roy Keane? ;)
THIS IS AWESOME
Gonna buy this game fosho, only cause of ted lasso
Hashtag United please
Hard😂😂😂😂
Why's he is Fifa? 😂
Wasn't he in the movie "we're the millers"?!?!
What a W. I’ll be getting this just because AFC Richmond
everyone talking about how this is sick.    me rewatching that two foot a billion times
Erm OK 👍 fifa we already know you're a joke 🙄
nope
pog
"... Giving players the choice to spend if they want to is fair"  Giving smokers the choice to buy cigarettes If they want to is fair Giving alcoholics the choice to buy alcohols if they want to is fair Giving addicts the choice to buy drugs if they want to is fair
Wot?
best thing EA has done in a long time
Awesome ❤️❤️❤️
football is life!
Waste of money and resources
football is life ⚽
lesss goo
Sir Alex Ferguson pls Ea
Cant wait to play Career Mode (both as player and manager) for AFC Richmond!
this was leaked since beta
Can’t wait to have as much Richmond stuff as possible for my team
This is insane
Last part was literally the best part
Good
Eso fue grabado en old gen y podemos apreciar como sale la animacion de ultimo minuto ¿LLEGARA?
Goat
Brexit tackle🔥😎
Club de cuervos next?👀

Just yestarday I watched again Horrible Bosses. What a coincidence 🤣🤣🤣
Fair play EA, might actually buy my first FIFA in 5 years thanks to this.
Roy kent

EA do more of this please
Are we getting random actors in the game now?
So is Nate The Great West Ham manager in game?
Who the hell is this guy bro
Who is Ted Lasso?
wow i love this
if i beat you with richmond, just delete the game bruh
Who?
Its 2022 , those characters look like Harry Potter on PS1
who is ted lasoo?
Apple payed for this , and you know how much EA loves money  🤑
saftladen
Instant 5k/10k manager.
Cool and all, but theyd rather add player faces for a tv show team, than actually update soooo many player and manager faces across the top leagues in the world 🙄
No way
And the face scan of Benfica, Porto, PSV, Ajax, Premier League, half Bundesliga, Inter, Milán, La Liga?
add Club de Cuervos then LMAO
EA got one right 🤩😍
Sooo Nice 😅👍🏻⚽️💯
I don't even know who Ted lasso is😅
who's he ?
Worst show ever.
w
He’s here, he’s there, he’s every #%^*ing-where Roy Kent… Roy Kent!!!
Already planned to buy this year's FIFA simply because its the last one. But now I have a legitimate reason to
But when Season 3?
Ponga en Español también. Yo no soy inglés
EA W

Hell yea. I am. All in on this
What a pointless addition. Make pro clubs better, no one cares about Ted Lasso
Brilliant
Ea add sean dyche thx
Ok apposto adesso lo compro sicuro
Football is life!!

Humoooo
Smoke jajajajajaa
THANK YOU EA! RESPECT 😍
Question…..will this team have a made up independent league or will be cast into ROTW   Never seen this show
Will this be available for career mode?
Literally have no idea who that is. Some handegg manager, I assume?
i’m so excited, I’m a huge Ted Lasso fan and FIFA fan so really looking forward to playing.    are they going to be in ultimate team as well
Yessss!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Coach Beard is even there! This is awesome!
Waiting for the ted lasso season 3🔥👑😝

What about world cup trailer?
Awesome trailer, very good aged from 2016
Everyone: bring more to career mode and have better gameplay   EA: here’s ted lasso and Richmond fc

This is actually jokes, fair play!😂

Who is he
Lol fifa is moving more toward fiction. I see. This would have been a welcome move had they kept club licenses
OMG. My favorite series in the game. Thank you Fifa for such a great inclusion. Not to mention Qatar 2022 upgrade is coming soon.
Well... It's time to preorder fifa 2023...
Thanx ea love u
Never watched Ted Lasso before, but it's always nice to see stuff like this being implemented into games. Good on ya, EA 👍
Kits and Club Creat for Fut? Save 2000 Fifa points 😂
Never heard of this guy 😅

10/10
Yes this more like it more off this please
Let's goo FIFA23 !!!
Interesting add for sure. Looks like all us create a club career mode guys will be able to have at least one fictional team with a sponsor and cool “real stadium” in the game. Not what I want out of career mode still but I’ll take it for now.
Lets go w***er!!!🥳
Came in at 53 mins
Looks like Pablo Escobar 😢
who is ted lasso
I'd use this guy for career mode
Who the hell is Ted Lasso ?
story of ted lasso in fifa 23?
I'VE PLAYED SINCE 1994 INTERNATIONAL SOCCER. MY ADVICE; STOP WASTING YOUR LIFE ON FUT MODE - ENJOY OTHER MODES.
ea gotta do more collabs like imagine if i could make my manager tony stark? make it happen ea🙏🙏
This is elite hats off to EA👏🏿👏🏿
Who?
This is gud
Who is ted lasso, im not from england sorry
Sick tbf
Haha that’s mad ! I might just get it to have ted 😂love the show
Despise FIFA, but this is the one time I might buy it
THIS IS AMAZING
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ no one actually cares about this. We want improvement for pro clubs.
The greatest thing EA has done in ages!!🔥🔥
Fifa Mobile 2023?
The greatest manager football has ever seen
Ted lasso >>>>Sir alex
Best manger in history
Wayne Rooney lol  I am actually really curious what stats the players will have xd
❤❤❤
HEY JAMIE, JAMIE     🖕
This is the best dlc ever.
You should make a story mode of it, like the journey but as a manager
fr fifa is becoming fortnite
immagine not knowing him biggest L ever
Last fifa i bought was fifa 19. Thinking of buying this one. I love the ted lasso tv show
For them who had no idea like me. Ted lasso is a comedy TV show about an American football manger in England
i hope i can do a career mode w them pleaseeee
Even if it has nothing to do with it, I have my say: the FIFA Community has now become toxic. Whatever the EA adds, does, etcetera, you are never happy and just criticize and nevertheless keep buying it. What more do you want from a football game that has already reached its peak and employees don't know what else to add?
No lie that’s kinda fire ..and I love the Ted Lasso series 💯👍🏼🔥
Great now we just need Mike Bassett !!
Esse fifa 23 vai tá insano, EA como sempre arrebentando!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
can’t wait for a career with ted lasso and richmond!! thank you ea❤
Who is this guy?!
Okay let’s wait and see 😂
My man looks like a pe6o
Please tell me the national league and national league north and south too
Wie geil ist das denn bitte 😍😍😍😅😅🎊🎊 ich Feier euch EA.
You’re joking right
A reason I am buying now.
A trailer for one manager but you guys dont add sheriff tiraspol
"Official Jesse Marsch Trailer"
Bruh
But why??
와..너무 좋고~
Lmbo!!!!!! Mad.💰💰💰
no reason for anyone to complain, its there for the people who want it but if you aren’t interested you can ignore it.
thank you EA for be fun and creative again
remove squad fitness cards
There you go EA 👏. Pulling out more gimmicks like your little brother Madden likes to do every year 🙄🤣. Trash.
So sick
Can you please get Arsenal players’ faces scanned too? What’s going on I don’t understand.
F IS THS
s/o fake Jack Grealish and Roy Keane
Trent Crimm.
*Siuuuuuuuuuu*
The best ❤❤
Even coach beard is there tooo ????!!!!!!
Whos Ted Lasso?
This would have me hyped if I wasn’t so disappointed by how much the game lacks in gameplay and design.
all that money spent on new models , but no updates on Benzema’s beard is crazy
Well now I dont know who to play for AFC Richmond or Wrexham. This is great tho!
Class concept tbf
Only Americans will like this
hope to see Keeley in some Roy goal celebration 😄
0:38 that tackle lmao !
So we have no brazil league, club World Cup, Mexican league no African leagues. Thank god we have a fictional team 🙃😑
Alex ferguson/Bob Paisley next please thank me later
Hey coach.
FOOTBALL IS LIFE !!!
Quién??
sorry, who is this teddy lasso guy? Only person who deserves a solo trailer is the Great Pep Guardiola!
Lmao this is golden ✨️ 🤣🤣🤣🤣
W
I hope you can use him as a coach for other clubs
YES
HUGE W
GIVE ME ROY KENT IN FUT AND TAKE MU MONEY !!!!
0:15 Man's living Jamie Tart's career irl isn't he
ODDIOOOOOO
w
Sad how americaised FIFA has become
football is life 😆
Can we use him for career mode?
Welcome Ted Lasso to EA Sports FIFA 23
AFC RICHMOND, CONFIRMED, TED LASSO CONFIRMED. HERE. WE. GO!!!
finally i have been waiting to use this team for so looooooonnnnnnnnggggg
Мда, осталось добавить аниме скинчики, на самом деле это плохая тенденция. Надеюсь будет возможность отключить эту команду в режиме карьеры. 🤮😒
You can add a whole new fictional team & manager but yet Arsenal players can’t get a decent face scan. Make it make sense 🤦🏾‍♂️.
W  ❤️ let's Goooooo We all Richmond ❤️🔥
Quite possibly the biggest L of this Fifa. Since when is some character from tv show relevant to the game and football. EA please get more national teams in the game and allow us to have career mode with, at the very least, options from Fifa's in the past
bro why ?
EA addition that is a W?????
Big Big W
Hyped🔥
Lmao they did this?
Same game every year
Rare FIFA W😂
W
Probably the biggest new feature
A fictional team in FIFA, but still no major Serie A licenses Ea…
Apple needs to make an new season now
I'm doing a carrer with him as my manager also will Afc Richmond be a rest of world team.
We love you EA, we do, we love you EA, we do, ooooooh EA WE LOVE YOU!
polska o co chodzi?
so random but im here for it do we get the players in FUT is the question...
W
thats fire
"EA Sports, I'm in the game" didn't expect that lmao
Huge L
what the front door was that
W EA
First time since FIFA WORLD CUP 14 that they get a W.
What da heeeeeell
WOW!GJ EA 👍
This is Dope For us 😅 Who Watched TED Lasso🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌🙌
So negative comments against this nonsense are being censored now?
FİFA 23 ÖN YUKLEME SORUNU ....hata veriyor
amazing!!!!
Haha i knew it! I love you so so so much Fifa❤️
This is the best thing FIFA has done in a long time, now if they could just add ICONS into career mode and regular then it would be great
Good
Wow great. When will this ice skate game be released?
where is the graphics? what a shame? I won't buy it.
Big dub bossman
Who is Ted lasso ?
bruh the leaks where real lol
Rare EA W
Scan arsenal players and up their ratings
Praise the players who still play the game with some new sbc's
Lots of shills in the comments section. This is pointless advertising from a gaming series that never wants to evolve but certainly likes to take all your money. I'm not surprised they have a sponsor deal with the biggest sportwashing club in history, Man City. Every one can be bought apparently. Wait for EA to delete this comment and having shills praise this mess.
W
Is this a story mode or something?
Lalo
Excelente ahora sí a jugar 😎 Dios mío que bien EA por esos buenas entrega 😎💪🙏
Finally EA do something good this is quality love the programme this will quality 👌
Fun fact: these are winning in the champions league
Seriously?
Nice
World cup mode+ Afc Richmont?? Its going to be one of the best fifas. Unfortunately its the last one💔
Чë бля? Вы ëбу дали?
Ayo
Best feature ever
Who tf is Ted Lasso? Lol
EA are doing something fun???
For one sec I thought this was the web app release trailer 😂
