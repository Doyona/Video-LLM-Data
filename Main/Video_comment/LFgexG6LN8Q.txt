Hey, Trey, you should do more of the vlog type content. I really think that many people will like the vlogs. I also think that you should do a house tour and just show off all of the cool stuff that you have. And lastly, I think that you should maybe do more than RP and that you should play the new spider man game on the ps5.
yo for real trey looks like Marty off of back to the future ngl
THAT WAS FUCKING FIRE

Does he actually drive a dodge charger
