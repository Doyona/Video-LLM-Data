I tried my best to hold it together
Good parents should be rewarded, to promote the concept of good parenting. Which is sadly rare in modern society.
My goal
Im not crying at all i swear😢
ive wanted to watch this video since i started watching golf like 2 years ago but i knew i would cry and u have made me bawl my eyes out
Brooo! Been watching the last 9 months and just found this personal gem. Love it
still waiting for the moment
From law by mike?
This was so nice to see, even though it did make me cry🥲
If you were going to cry, why did you give it?
I'm late to the you tube game but due to loss of job and forced retirement, i have more time. This episode got me very emotional in a good good way. I lost my father in 2009 but he is still with me in many ways. Taught me golf at 8 years, bought me my first matching set of clubs ( wilson X31) got me lined up with a golf pro at the local Country club ( Dominic Manari at Lebanon CC). One of many things golf gives besides manners, respect for others, respect for the grounds, but the memories! I was playing a late nine holes when he had his only hole in one! blind green so we were looking everywhere except the hole for over 5 minutes. Finally I mentioned to my father too check the hole and lo and behold. we celebrated that evening and relived the shot many times. thank you for sharing your good fortune, from hard work to great parents. Hug them as much as you can life is short.
God bless you parents for raising a wonderful son a lot of parents is not that fortunate❤🎉🎉🎉 consider yourself blessed 🙏🙏🙏🙏🕊️🕊️
My goal in life is
They raised a great young man! Good for you !
That was amazing
what a moment
Best video I’ve ever seen.   So humble and kind.   Your raised right my man !!
I played golf at my local club with a 15 year golfer and we chatted about our favourite YouTube golfers. I said mine was Grant, Luke Kwon and Bryan bros and he said Garrett Clarke. I thought the few videos I saw of you that you were a little cocky. But seeing how you handled losing the 4th game of the recent road trip challenge to Grant made me a big fan of you. You and Grant are the good apples that didn’t fall far from the very good apple tree.
Bra✊🏼👏🏼
Stop braging about u paying ur parents,lol u owe ur life to ur parents....
Your parents remind me of my grandparents I miss my grandpa. The towels they both used on the table is so real
This is the biggest thing man. Congrats

*That was so sweet and beautiful.*
sadly it like 55k after tax
Remember folks…if it’s not documented on social media it never happened 🤷🏻‍♂️
Parents would be like "Is this before or after tax?"
Well.. about the nicest rich kid I've ever seen...  humble beyond your years young  man ...I see why you are how you are.... Beautiful parents. 🙌
This is my dream. Thank you for showing it’s possible
Your parents are already loaded 😂.
I'm a disabled vet. you know how dramatically $100,000  would better my and my kids lives? I'll never get that, but it makes me happy at least some people will.
Right on buddy. So happy for you. I'm 55. Can't work. No money. I came to tears as your mom opened the card and saw the check. Amazing. I will never be able to do that. God bless you and your family. Love your videos. Keep up the hard work.
I came across your channel, maybe 40 minutes ago, Tuesday 06/ 08/2024 watched the one where your friend, had the Gold date, they both played really great. Any follow up on there date at all, or did they part ways. My 2nd video was this one. That was one of the most kindest things I’ve seen in a long time, done by the son, for his parents. Amazingly kind gesture. Us parents, do what we can for our children. Mom & Dad, you have raised an amazing great Son.
I don’t trust mika gerrett. I just can’t trust him.
Thank YOU Garrett! The Good Good Crew is amazing.    Also I’m not crying you’re crying
Great job Garrett! You brought a tear to my eyes.
Grateful, that I live in a country where education is free.
God bless you and your parents❤!!!
When you show emotion about something, it means you care about it. Very nice thing you did.
One day I’m going to pay my parents back 50k each when I get my dream job for Christmas and I’m going to pay back my sister a bit as well for all they’ve done for me and then the next year
That put me in tears within the first few seconds of the video,  I to am close with my parents and lost my mom in 2017.  I'm 49 years old and there isn't a day that goes by I wish I could of shared my success with her .  Big wings waiting for you one day my good man .❤
That’s something that every kid dreams of doing for their parents or at least I really would love that. Super happy for you
You’re one of the good ones GC keep up the work!
What a dude. Well done young man 👏🏽
ive only just discovered golf and good good i this made me tear up
one day i will do this
I'm not a big crier (cryer? 🤔) when I'm sad, but when I have those moments of overwhelming gratitude, I definitely am. And when I see other people experiencing those moments of gratitude, it triggers my gratitude. On top of that, having a five year old son and seeing how proud your parents are of the man you've become... man that's just good stuff ❤
I hope One day i am going to give my parents $100,000, just like u man. while i am watching this video i am just crying man it just hits so hard you know.
Respect and congrats man
Garrett!  OMG. UNREAL!  So amazing so awesome!  THAT’S LOVE
Those are some great parents right there
The Bible say honor thy Father and Mother God honors this, set your mind on what you want, and keep doing what you’re doing and you’ll always be blessed. Psalms 37:4.
Glad you can give to your parents. Happy for you and them
father is hiding his tears! feels proud on you 😎
You gotta day you give them 100k then slide 1mil under the table 😉
Class act
Beautiful moment
Every child’s dream. Amazing brother.
im 13 years old and i m alredy trading i want to make it and make my parents proud
Imagine doing it with the cameras off.
Man, you have me crying. That was very heartfelt and true man stuff there.
B.E.A utiful
So they went on a nice ass vacation right
It is such a blessing to watch wholesome and humble content from young people. We see so much nonsense on social media, to know that there are honest hardworking and honorable young men who respect their parents and are trying to do good for the community is refreshing and uplifting. Thank you Garret Clark and the Good Good community!
Dude what a great mom. “Just being you is gift enough for us.”
I wish i could have both of my parents still together to do this at the same time, but unfortunately it will have to be separate
I’m in bits just watching this! Super stuff 🥹🥹
Good for you brother. Great choice. 👍
That was amazing G!
This is the most genuine video I’ve seen on YouTube. This is what it’s all about. Money is just extra.
This might be the best video I’ve ever watched
Garrett, you have incredible parents who love you, and you can’t put a price on that! I can tell you’re a good man, and they raised you the right way. Keep up the good work, don’t forget how far you’ve come, and don’t forget that your family will always love you more than anyone else in the world! Listen to them! God bless y’all!
I've just recently found your golf videos and I've watched, probably, a hundred videos on your channel and Good Good. Seeing you do this shows me the kind of man that you are. Good for you and good job by your parents to support your dream.
Love it, Garrett. That's Good Good stuff!
Invest it, invest it, invest it, or they will tax you to death. Like 40%...!!!      Invest it.    Do not stick it in the bank.   Do not.     Beautiful event.          Peace.
love you Garrett, you inspire many and you are always humble bro. be proud of yourself and if your ever near six flags magic mountain in Santa Clarita Ca lmk and i got you a round of golf bro
Great video. Great family.
well deserved. Ever upwards, my boy.
Must be trappin on the side bc to only have 125k subs and give ur mom 100k mhmmm?? Someone’s trappin
Dude, I don't even know you and this video brought me damn near to tears. Very wholesome and very much of what I'd like to do for my folks as well.
“That’s gonna be good for about 20 years” I want so badly to hear that from my parents. Thanks for really sparking that Garrett. I will comment back on this video one day thanking you again for the fire that really got me going. Watching your mom’s reaction alone was enough for me.
The second his mom saw the amount and dropped everything, and started crying, I lost it.
So glad I found this channel….its the people and the time you share.  Good Good…Great Great in my eyes
Love the content bro, keep it up. Love how humble you are!
Getting a little dusty over here.
Unbelievable touch garrett fare play
Great job Garrett
❤
Good job young man. Really enjoy all you do.
This just popped up in my algo and glad it did. Awesome to be able to do that!
What a great kid.
I have been following you for years and keep that kind heart with you whatever you do.  When you meet your future wife have that same type of attitude.  Grown men cry and like you said your mom and dad allowed for you to do this.
He is so grateful for such a young age. Great job young man. Many times, adult children his age are taking money from their parents or the parents aren't smart enough to realize, that after a while their kid has to make it on his/her own.
Love it brother!!!
First time seeing this channel and this family...and wow, what an incredible, loving, and warm family atmosphere. Everything about these people, their home, their friends, just shows how good-hearted they all are. God bless them, what a gift.
It rhymes with checkbook..........lol..lol..lol..lol..lol.  Great son. Mom and dad are good people. By the way, I love your table and chairs.
You have a heart of gold Garrett, great video, any parent would be proud. 👍
3:47
Never gets old to watch
So sweet. Made me cry ❤
If I had a son, I did like him to be just like you.
What the heck son - legend
Bravo! I bet your parents are so proud of you.
That is a GOOD Son!
Good on you Garret, well done. And it was good to see Mica there as well as he shared the start of all this with you...
Well done Garrett! Parents are everything
You did good young man... great example for many (you tubers specifically) Stay humble. Be blessed
You're a good son..
No your crying!
Your mom didn't tell me she was married
Waarom krijgen deze kinderen zo veel geld gestort om de sier op YouTube te maken belachelijk.🤣
That is proof of LOVING PARENTS and raising an appreciative son.😊
This has to be the most self serving BS video ever made.  Trying to show off on youtube and get paid back by views, this is really sick and selfish.  What a jerk.
You guys give me hope for the next generation 😍
❤ Perfect.
So proud of you! I love this!!! You’re awesome!!!👍🏼
if that was my mom she would say what took u so  long gd job dude
now this is a perfect example of good family values!
Here's 100,000 grand - look at the house they live in look at the furnishings lol bruh.
I may be watching a year late,  but you can tell your dad is so proud of you
This was the most heart warming Act I have ever seen. Congratulations......it feels good doesn't it! Keep giving,  even if it is a little bit like buy meals for homeless or a room with a shower for the night with a razor shaving cream and a deodorant.  Gives them a little pride and feel good. God Bless you!❤
It's one thing to be humble and just give your parents the money cuz seems most idiots who follow you know you are wealthy from idiotic social media.  But you had to do it on a video for the views, so get real this is not being humble, because being a good guy and humble would mean doing things without others knowing and looking for that praise, but no one in your age group even knows what that means anymore!!!  Everything you people do is for clicks and money, period!! That is just so lame and you will not even get that and erase this post and I hope that shit haunts you forever, that you are just like the guy who gets the nice car!!!!
New sub here, what a great video !! Your parents are amazing and your Mom is beautiful !! They raised a great young man. I'm not a big golfer here but I am definitely a fan !!
🥲
Amazing young man,God bless you 🙏. I see this was 1y ago I came across your YouTube channel this wonderful morning 🌞 what did I see❓ I see a Young man,years in his 👀 and talking about how wonderful his parents are and his friends are around him . Young man you have a glow all around you and yes I watched your whole video crying through it but (your parents are amazing/wonderful) you are the light shine on bright God loves you stay strong, stay safe.🙏🙏🙏🙏
Mr. Clark…. You are an amazing kid. My favorite guy on golf YouTube. Keep grinding brother
They taught you well.
What a wonderful SON
U have help me with golfing
your parents are the best
5:10. Grab some tissues.
Had me crying man in the first 2 min.  Wow amazing guy. New subscriber here
A fine young man thank you
I sure hope you did that in a way that they don’t have to pay taxes on it! Don’t give the ‘wasters’ in government a dime more than you have to.
I haven't seen any of your videos but after watching this I can't wait, you have a great soul and your parents are beyond proud of you. You're an inspiration to so many and I can't wait to follow along. Thanks for being a Good Good  person 😊
Well done, garret. It seems like you have an amazing family and you all deserve one another.
When i watch these videos of kids blessing their parents , their stories of why and how they are successful ALWAYS comes back to the parents being fully supportive , i strive to be a fully supportive parent .
What a wonderful young man......respect to you garrett
Love it.  Love the Jeep in the background to 😏. And the farmers tan. 🥵
fake
You have great parents man ❤
I what to call you awesome nephew you can call me uncle t
Can I call you awesome awesome awesome Garrett can I pick on you put your hands behind your back you are arrested and handcuffed  You are so awesome
I love how excited and heartfelt this video is
You’re a good man, Garrett ❤🎉
this would of been an incredible gesture if you didnt record it then prostitute it over social media just to get more subs
You are a good son.
You were so hot!!!
You know his parents probably put that check into the bank for him to get back at a later date. That's what my parents would do.
What a wonderful person you've  raised
wow nice...... my channel only has 300 subs I couldn't imagine doing this for my 90 year old father...
YOU'RE just so humble. NOT
Absolutely beautiful gratitude ❤
Gmoney clark
old video just love this one well done
His parents thought he was definitely coming out
Looks like they really need it
How???
Your folks have spent WAY more than $100K on you but your focus on repaying them $100k is special!
damn what a good video made me cry
Great video. Shows parenting can mean a world of difference. Glad you paid them back, wish everyone could!
You have a great example for the future when you become a parent.
Since tone isn’t conveyed via written communication, I hope you understand with what I’m going to say is not me trying to shame you, shit on you, or be critical of what you choose to do in an effort to take away from the point.      As everything else aside, it’s awesome they raised you to have the kind of heart to want to do things for others w/o ever being asked to do things for those around you.     Something in life that changed my perspective was when someone I respected a great deal(role model/family friend), whom built a highly successful business for themselves plus passing on generational wealth after starting from nothing, was paraphrased below.     Whenever you do a good deed no matter how small or how big, the most important thing is to remember. God knows, you know, & the person who received the gift knows. End of the day that’s enough, & those are the people who it matters the most too.     Yet. I can understand things being different to document things given you make your living on social media it’s a way to both give back, & to have monetized content. While I’m not that old it’s something that is new-ish to the workforce as a whole & there for with change will come a change in both accepted group in social norms.     Point being, when all said & done no matter the way you choose to present things, what counts is that you were able to be there & help those who had always been there to help you. Which I hope was a great feeling to do that for someone who sacrificed so much by supporting you as you went after whatever dreams you may had in the past or the dreams you will have in the future.
What a moment to share with us all G :)  Thanks, it is so nice to see. Oh, and I am 57, watched all the good-good stuff, and are working my way trough all of GM and this Vlog - just love what you guys do, and my own preference is, I love GM a tad more, since it seems so genuine - all of it. By the way, would love to buy the new putter you took from the warehouse after handing yours away to that young boy in the putting comp. Sadly, there is no way to get it up here in Norway :)  Keep all the good stuff comming, this realy affects people, both young and old   Oh, would also love to see you in a 1v1 with Viktor Hovland, he is a nice lad - just like you guys! Humble and just love golf!!
I agree with people that this was probably a private moment. It’s like calling the press letting them know your going to do some charity and want it broadcasted. Just saying
Alright I cried too. We all wish we could do this for our parents. My old man got me into golf as a kid. Cursed him but man did it make me a better person. Learned patience, mental fortitude, calmness. He passed last year from cancer. When I golf I golf with him still
Be proud brother , you climbed the mountain and made your dreams happen. Our parents , the hood ones , need nothing more than to see us succeed. The fact that you could do this for them is amazing. Don’t know you personally only been watching some kid make trick shots in his backyard for years and years but man am I proud of you
Is that Tig standing near Bubby ??
This makes a grown man cry! Well done young man.
congrats bro, one day God will give me the opportunity to do this for my family.
Stupid... rich people problems...
this is pure love, so happy for you and your family and friends
You can tell your parents just love you for you. If you came over and just hungout with them for the day it would probably make there year.
I’m not a golf fan and I don’t know who this guy even is, but what a wonderful video. Great young man and awesome parents. Mom goes all mom: “Having you is enough.” Dad goes all dad with a discussion on taxes and later wiping away the tears.
Probably more of a private moment
I cried... what a great moment!
50 years from now you will look at this video and tears will flow again.  Great moment in you life.
Your parents are very proud of you
Beautiful
Oh wow. Now they should make a video of everything they done for you
why am I crying a whole year later
Those parents raised a good kid
Thank GRat for making me cry at work. You were raised right and your folks know which end is up.
Really hope Garrett is as good if a person as he seems on videos.
Yall owe brodie some cash I think too.
I’m not crying youre crying
What a family <3
This is the best video I’ve seen in a long time. Stay right with the Lord Garrett and your life will be amazing. 🙏🏻🏌️‍♂️
Garrett my friend you have done what a lot of good sons and daughters dream of doing for their parents, and I am one of those sons that never was able to fulfill that dream.  The Good in GoodGood should read GreatGreatPeople.  Bubbie and Michael you got to experience this and it will always be a memory never to be forgotten.  Your Dad said it best it is God Reward for hard work. And, you gave it right back to the originators of the God's Blessing. We only can dream that we can do it too. Hay..! Where are your "Junior Golf Videos" like to watch your evolution in the sport of Golf...
49 year old Christian from Northern Ireland here, that was a wonderful gesture, other than love I was never really able to give back anything much to my parents before my mum passed away, she gave me so much over the years but watching this made me cry, that's not a normal accurance for me lol God bless you all at Good Good golf, may the Lord continue to bless you so that you're able to continue giving to others. 🙏🙏🙏
Incrdedible G, a very special moment and just love the love and respect you have for your parents. HUGE RESPECT bud. By the way you have amazing folks. Cheers
Man, i came back a year later and rewatched this and cried AGAIN just like my comment from when you first released it. Tammy's reaction just killed me. Love your eyes, Rat.
Your a good son.
Reality at its finest, well deserved ❤
Every sons dream and u done it Garrett. I’m just an ol redneck from south Mississippi and you touched me with how sincere your intentions were. This wasn’t for clout or to brag this was pure love and that’s what this world needs. Just love from the heart and a fair shake in life. God speed to you my friend
Alot of people say they wish they could do that. But when given the opportunity would they? Most people are selfish
❤
good job brother I'm proud of you, me and my son just finished watching this video you have inspired me and my son playing we just started my son just turned 12 and he's not doing too bad he is hitting the driving range at three hundred yards not too bad for his he is always watching your YouTube and you have inspired him good job for doing that for your parents God bless 🙏🥲🤜🤛
That's amazing Garrett. I'm so happy that you made it!!
7:30  that yeah changed the whole room,like a movie scene
Love u
This is probably the second best gift they ever had in their lives, apart from your birth
Respect🫡❤️
❤
Why u stop videos?
I'm probably older than his parents, don't  have kids but I found this very touching.  I immediately recognized what a sweet kid Garrett is from the very beginning
for real i wonder what made this men called our fathers strong because notice how the mother and son cried but father strong as fuck
I think it's appropriate that they get a plaque , for PARENTS of the decade award
IM NOT CRYING UR CRYING '-'
You are a good person and a good son.
This is awesome! This is what life’s all about!
Beautiful
Who’s still waiting for the next vlog
The Good Son
I love this. I didn’t make it through without tearing up.
respect 👍
Your a good boy mate... wish there were more like you.. keep it up G.
Where the hell did Bubbie come from 😂
Who's a good boy?! You're a good boy!
What a guy ! Garrett your a credit to your family. Love watching your videos.
Watched this when it first came out.  Watched it again just now.  Cried multiple times both the first and last time I watched it.  So jealous you got to do this amazing thing for your parents man.  You earned it! But damn so cool!
"What the heck son!"
Made me tear up seeing her reaction, major props to you bro
I’m not crying… you’re crying 😢.
So touching, i am literally crying, both at the intro part and after you presented the cheque. So proud of you, and what you've done!  I have been following Good Good and you only recently, but you guys have done amazing work that inspired millions (no exaggeration) of young golfers! Looking forward to more videos soon, supporting you always! (please consider replenish that Twig polo medium size, it has been out of stock for long now 😅)
God bless g
That’s awesome 😎 feels good to give back
Damn man got me seriously crying over here 😂
We need more Garrett Clark vlogs!!
Congrats on how far you’ve come your story is so cool and giving back to your parents is so awesome you’re the man 👊🏼
You’re the best Garrett. You being a genuine young man keeps us coming back for more! Keep being you man God has major plans for you.
been watching the trick shots for years now it’s been such a treat to watch you grow all these platforms that’ve been created from the backyard trick shots
This video makes me cry. There were many times in my life that I gave up belief in myself, but my parents never doubted me for a moment. I can’t imagine where I’d be in life without them. Good on you Garrett for recognizing that support and showing gratitude. I’m sure seeing you happy and have belief in yourself is worth more than any gift you could ever give them.
Ugh, I'm crying. What a beautiful video this is.
Your a great kid, man! Giving back to your parents should be something everyone strives for. Its not easy to step back and realize all the sacrifice they make for us. Glad you were able to see your goals realized
This is just awesome! Glad I found this channel and you guys. ya'll have made me look forward to seeing ya'll every day. and this is coming from a 45yr old man.
That's stupid.. You wanna do that, you do it privately.
Awesome
For what it's worth. I'm proud of you. Well done. God bless you and your family.
one day.
Emotional and real. Love it. I'd be the same as you.
Gratitude, great attitude!!
Love it! I started a business to try to save up and buy my 61 yo dad a vehicle (nothing special, just something to go from a to b).. my parents have had a rough go in recent years and dads truck gave out a few years ago. He had been riding a bike to work at 3am every morning.. now my mom gets up and takes him in their only vehicle (a 360,000 mile Buick LeSabre). I dream of being able to do something like this for them! I love your content and the effort you and the guys put into it! I wish you nothing but luck and congrats on your accomplishments.
Goals
This is amazing! You can tell his parents care so much about their kid she’s literally shaking to open the letter not knowing what news he’s about to give. Ur awesome for doing this for your parents!
What a good boy. Truly awesome
We can all laugh and joke everyday, but we all have a reason why we are here. You are smashing it and good on you for giving back to your parents who have clearly given you so much.   Now go out and beat 65 😉
You weren’t the only person crying. You have your heart in the right place Garrett J Clark.
Garret way to go so classy
Garrett this is an amazing Video man. Kudos to you. I enjoy watching you a ton!
I got sand in both my eyes
You're awesome Garrett! Love the Good Good channel. Your stuff is so entertaining. Loved the stuff with Rick Shiels as well - big fan of his channel. You are all so funny and I enjoy watching your events. You guys are so blessed to have a great group of guys to play golf with - inspirational! My golf game has improved a lot just by watching the way you all go about the game. Love this video too of you giving back to your parents, very moving! Congrats on all your success.
I know what you mean man, I'm 32 and only really started giving back to my parents in the last year. It's not so much money but maintaining thier property and doing stuff they can't do as they get older. I'm not sure how much longer I have with them so I really want to be a positive influence on thoer life and help them.  Well done I'm glad you have the opportunity to do this, I feel that you are genuinely giving to your parents.
Weird flex
aww, your mom is so sweet!
Every time I find one of these videos I find more things to like about you guys.  Such amazing dudes!
You're a good dude Garrett and your parents are lovely and deserving of your amazing gift. All the success to you going forward.
who filed the gift tax return?? need help on this...send a DM!
That was a beautiful thing you did for your mum and dad well done sir 👍
Wow kids your age need to take note. Respect those who come before us
Fantastic 🎉
How am I just seeing this?   Garrett, you are an inspiration to a generation.   I can totally understand your emotions.    So glad to have been following along throughout your journey on YouTube.
This is the best thing I've seen on Youtube in a long time. You can tell there is no theatrics or false flexing. Character is something you cant fake. Garrett is such a likeable kid and its no wonder he has a massive following. I'm 59 and now that I have built my businesses, I love playing golf. I cant get enough of these videos. They are fun, entertaining and I especially enjoy the fact that they are cognizant of the necessity of protecting the brand by keeping profanity out of the videos. This is a great young man with an incredible future.
Awesome content and this is why I love Good Good and GM
Those parents raised a great young man.  Now he will be blessed even more for what he done for his parents.  That was huge blessing for them and I know it made you extremely PROUD to do it.  Keep it up young man your awesome.
Love this. Nice work buddy. Always take care of the ones that took care of you 👏🏼
That was so wholesome and put a smile on my face. Thats really awesome man jeez
Great job young man. It’s so refreshing to see this heartfelt thank you to your parents & your friends & viewer’s. Keep on keeping on & keep smiling 😁
"Just beeing you is enough for us" wow that is Something my Mother also would say ❤️. That was amazing
I found you guy’s trying to fix my swing in golf at 44 yrs old to start playing golf with my kid’s that just got in to the sport! Now I have tear’s running down my face at at 6am You guy’s are great
Thatta boy G! Always gotta take care of mom and pops first. You got my respect ✊🏽
Great stuff
What a man
Wow I’m truly inspired way to go Garrett
your a good man...
❤
Now I know how Garrett turned out the way he did.
Wow wow wow! 🥹🥹🥹
Thank you to you and your folks for sharing this with everyone. You are inspiring and you do reach the young people out there. I was on the range today and there were a couple boys around fourteen in the next bays talking about the $30 vs $3,000 club challenge video and Garrett and Grant. They were playing Trackman range games against each other, bantering with each other, not cursing and having a great time. You had something to do with that. What you're doing has value. Don't ever let anyone tell you different.  Keep being you and making good hearted content. When the time comes and you do get older, since you made such an impact on younger players, maybe you could mentor a new group of young creators to keep the message alive. All the love to you, the other Good Good guys and your families.
Good for you. Clearly they did something right.
Absolutely one of the best moments in your parents life I’m sure . To be able to raise a son that loves them as much as you is a feeling that you can’t put words on ! Congrats !! Keep up the great vids and love !!
This is amazing! I was able to buy and pay cash for my mother, a Cadillac cts took me alot of hard work and it’s an emotional but greatful moment!
Good for you young man, much respect
You're the man Garrett! You're my favorite of the Good good group. You worked hard to get to the point to do this. Congratulations! Hard work pays off right? Feel proud, you earned it
Made me tear up watching this moment between you and your parents and I just started watching you guys for crying out loud lol. Respect!
You are a wonderful soul Garrett.You and your parents should both be proud. Big fan here in the north 🇨🇦. You should do a tour of Okanagan Valley. We have some of the most beautiful courses on the planet. Keep up the good work. You have changed lives.
They made me cry..... i never had that kind of money but I gave a Girl 1500 to get a vehicle fixed so she could take care of her kids.....  I only knew her from a friend and Myspace....  she tried to give me a car..... ha..... but That Shows your Character Garrett ...Love ya Man.... God Bless Ya...
Really… the best about watching you guys is not your golf or whatever… just you showing up good good values <3
Why tf am I crying
That was amazing! What a blessing for all of you. You got me on that one. God bless you all. That was divinely inspired.
Good for you Man! Best video so far!
Alright who’s cuttin onions 🥲🥲🥲
That's great! Just being helpful here. You will pay a gift tax on $68,000. You can exclude $16,000 per person. The IRS would probably not know except for this video. You could spread it out over 3 years? Maybe it doesn't matter. Enjoy your content. You boys are also good good.
Giving back and to others is what it's all about way to go and may God bless you.
As a small Creator myself, this was my main goal for getting into content too. Still have a note I wrote to myself on the bottle of whiskey my Dad bought me for my college grad that says "open this bottle when you pay off Dad's mortgage". Loved seeing this side of you man, and very proud that you were able to accomplish what you set out to do.
You are a Good Good son Garrett, love all you & the crew does. may God bless and open doors for all of you.
Congratulations Garrett on achieving one million subscribers on good good👍🏌‍♂️⛳️🏆
god damn these onions! who's chopping onions lol
Such an incredible post. So much love here, your awareness of sacrifices and love parents go through for their children is beautiful. Some people never get it. Golf has been something I was able to share with my boys as they grew up. I lost my older boy to suicide when he was 26. I think of him everyday and miss him. He’d have fit in very well with your crew. Happy, hilarious and fun. You guys are doing amazing work, lightening hearts, promoting fun golf, healthy competition, cooperation amongst different personalities shows maturity beyond your age. Congratulations mom and dad!!
Never hold back bud, just let the emotion and tears roll. I've always believed those who can show their emotions are the strong ones. Keep being you my man!
God bless you Garrett.  A wonderful thing to do, and keep keeping it real buddy.
I think Garrett paid for half of the 100k from this videos views alone!
That's why I love these guys
Very well done G! Your parents are so proud of you. I'm a fan for life
Duuhh i gave my parents 100k but i have to record and act like its natural
Awesome life experiences
Great video, tears of Joy. Thanks
Made me cry… awesome man!
God bless you Garrett Clark. Good man.
Awesome
Something that we would all love to do for our parents. I love how you’re not like other channels and flaunt your money in other peoples faces. This is an exception because of how amazing this feeling could be. Happy for you
So cool amazing
What an awesome young man.
Damn onions!
So awesome...the prodigal son.  His parents seem like such good people, and if Garrett is any reflection on how he was raised, they certainly are and should be very proud.
This is awesome.
Great video, with all the things happening today, watching this brings you back. Get back to Chicago, we missed you that last time you were here.
Very touching. Hope I can do something like this some day.
That's awesome brother, so cool to see you give back to your parents!
Screw the onions, this made me cry. 💯🥹😂  Seriously, Garrett, your parents are both right. You and the boys have “changed lives” by “just being you.” I knew who y’all were but didn’t really start watching until COVID. My buddy who also watched, saw my love for it and gave me a set of clubs. I’d never been on a course until I was 24. Now, golf is my outlet. When I can just relax, be in nature, and connect with people that matter to me.  I can honestly say that I 100% believe that while the content is the best in the world; what keeps people coming, and coming back, is y’all’s humility and genuineness.  Thank YOU. From all of us.   Also, Next time you’re in Branson, Dunkin’s on me. 😉
That was awesome …. Good job you little rich punk👍…. I’m starting a YT channel tomorrow … just need to figure out what ?
Such a goog good dude!
Nothing like doing a good deed for clicks right!
Here from Bob Does Sports.  You seem like a great guy and awesome seeing the payback to parents who backed you.  Special!
Garrett, this is so great.  Without our parents where would we be?   I think back to my Mom and Dad following me to cross country and track meets to watch me run, then onto racing bicycles and all the races. They were always there for me and I want to be the way my parents were, and yours were to you, to my own children.    This was incredible Garrett.  Thanks for sharing this moment with us.
its been prooven!! when u take care of your kids they will take care of you! i cant tell ya how many times my mom cried at christmas time when we got her stuff that she had no idea about that was wayyy so expensive ..
Beautiful man. Amazing experience.
legend.  Good lad.
Well done 👏🏼 top man 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
To be able to do this for your parents is absolutely amazing and to be able to do it doing something you love is special. Good luck to all the Good Good boys in the future, great set of lad's
What your Dad understands is Golfosophy - hence building you the putting green. What your Mom understands (as all Moms do) is Loveosophy! I was a teenager who shot under par all the time, turned golf pro, and learned to not like golf...especially teaching people. But, alas, it wasn't about anything but my issues. First my addiction to attention as a teen and loving the accolades of being the best at the course and winning tourneys, and, then as an adult of by just saying to people that I was a PGA of Canada golf "professional" and the addiction to attention continued through feeling that others were impressed by that fact. Which, they ought not have been as I was not "professional" in the true sense of Golfosophy or Loveosophy. You, my friend, are BEING professional, and, it is f'in beautiful to watch you crush life! Appreciate you, your folks, and, all the Good Good squad. Grind on! xo
What a lovely family...and a decent young man you are
Awesome stuff
Golf videos are not supposed to make me cry, but here I am, using up an entire box of tissues.
What a man 👌🏼
i teared up
Man, this is awesome! It's almost negates the cesspool that is Twitter and most of social media. Garrett, this is incredible, man. As a father of a college-aged son, this kind of thing is a parent's dream come true. (Not the money; the thoughtfulness.)
Good Good is the perfect name for this channel
💚
Greatness brother!!
That’s dope man!!! I can agree It does feel great when you can give back to your parents!!!
Good on you  Garrett !!  World needs more  just like you !!  Testament to what awesome parents can raise.
What a wholesome video! Congrats Garret, well deserved to be able to make ur wishes come true!
Priceless!
Great job buddy
🤣damn bro Im waking up just to cry, youtube recommended doin me dirty
I’m a golf “nut” and I’ve been watching GoodGood for a while now, but now you’ve struck a chord in my heart. As a Dad and Grandpa, I understand how proud your parents are of you. Your respect and gratitude for your parents’ sacrifices is an extremely admirable trait and you (and your GG team)deserve all the success you’ve achieved.
Awesome kid 👍
Good good guys are an inspiration. Great examples of friendship, sportsmanship, and values.
Dude... this vid is really f'in cool. Bravo to you young man.
Well done buddy
Micah drinking coffee in the corner……
Mad respect!!!! Love your content broseph!!!!
Epic! Congrats.. Your parents raised a great young man...
Look at the house though. They could afford to take the time/provide the means to support an endeavor like golf. Some of us didn’t even grow up in a home we could call our own.
I'm not crying, you're crying
This is so beautiful G!
Why hasn't LIV offered these two guys millions?
I know this is older. But never take for granted having them around for as long as you do. I lost my father at 2 years old, and my mother at 21... when you lose parents that early, you feel like there's a hole that could never be filled, and will never be filled. This made me tear up, enjoy every moment you get Garrett, stay humble.
Pops..."That's going to be good for about 20 years"....love it!!!! You have a great family!!!!!
I’m not crying, you’re crying! 😭
A very special moment for all of you .... The Good Good crew work hard for all they have and it's good (good) to give back.
your parents raised a great son!
Perfect video... know why its perfect? (Aside from the gift) the camera pans over and there is tig with a cup of coffee
great job man wow
You didn't earn that money. What a joke.
I'm not crying u are
good kid
I want to do this for my parents so much…
Just had our first kid...a son who's 10months old! Can't wait to show him the game and spoil him like your parents did for you. You're a good son, man. And you're all great role models for kids growing up. Awesome video!
Man you're a great kid, your parents are very lucky to have a boy like u. Take care young man.
What a truly wonderful son.
Incredible
I barely made it through this video, great job bro. Maybe one day I can do the same !
I love this . Great parents and great job by you giving back to your parents
Good man!!!!!!
Your blessed, grateful and appreciative... what more could parents want, your a great kid- all of you are!  Keep up the great work fellas!!
Video starts @ 4:25
Good lad
Absolutely sent me into tears. What a wholesome moment
bro got youtube to comment😂
I lost my mother when I was 3 yo and my father when I was 14. I miss them so much but I'm so happy when I see guys like you with awesome parents!
Dude it's only 9:30am and I'm crying already
Tears for ya'll such a wonderful moment. Great parents that raised a Gem. Congrats all around.
Hey can you please tell me how too get that hair it looks fire
Youtuber: buy sport car Garrett: im not going to do that  Also Garrett: ridin a Jeep
💯 AWESOME!!!!!
I cried too bro. I've just started watching your videos. The brotherhood you guys have is far surpassing the golf itself. Your parents raised an amazing son. I'm proud to support you and the guys going forward!!!
Beautiful I tried to do the same but my business failed due to supplier issues
This is why people love good good content. Because you guys are just real people doing what you love and you're such good guys that you've earned an amazing following! Congratulations Garrett.
It sounds like you have great parents Garrett! You need to make them feel special, just like they did for you! Coming from someone who has a terrible relationship with both parents, I can only wish I had the same. I say that respectfully. Your parents did a good job raising you. You are a respectable young man.
You are going places G, keep being you.
Awesome thing to do Garret!  This is something that I would love to do for my folks.
Made my cry
What happen to Bro5..
To this day, the proudest moment of my life was when I knew my dad needed some help and I was able to stroke a check to get it done. We're nothing without our parents, and it's not until we get older that we finally realize how much they sacrificed to get us where we are, selflessly willing us to be the best versions of ourselves. I know it meant as much for you as it did for them, really special moment. Congratulations on your success.
What a great guy....a real credit to your parents. I'm sharing this with my son now, hope he gets the hint.
Good job Garrett!!! Great to see that there is still hope for your generation.
Love this. I hope I can do the same for my parents
God has blessed you and your family, happy for you🙏🏼
Bless your heart! Thats just amazing!! More blessings to come Mr Clark!
I lost both of my parents, my mom at an early age and my dad a few years ago. This video made me tear up, for where I'm at today I wish I could do the same thing today with my parents. The good good golf fam is truly an inspiration in my life right now, keep up the awesome videos.
Loved it good shit !!!!!!!
This video will change my life and I will remember this video. Thanks for posting
This is amazing to watch. I'm proud of what you've done. I just sub to your channel. Keep it up
Yeah guys Good Good desperately needs our support, they're really struggling. Meanwhile Garret can drop 100k to his parents like that while he drives his hummer over. These dudes are rolling in money; they're asking you to keep their gravy train rolling
I’m headed to the store for some Pedialyte to rehydrate my eyes, so thanks for that. Good on you, man. Clearly a very special family.
Good for you!
Absolutely pathetic and an accurate example of how people feel the need to video gestures. If it was coming for the right place, you wouldn’t have video’d. You’ve done this for attention..:that’s it
Good Good is Awesome Awesome!!!
No I’m not crying from a Garrett Good Good video…
Your pops reached straight for the card to read it he didn’t care so much about the value of the gift and that speaks magnitudes to me about who he is and the kind of man he’s raised you to be they did an excellent job man congratulations on your success I hope I can do this for mine one day.
Awesome man. Happy for you and your family and all the Good Good guys! Thank God
Well you got me there i had to just listen in the end cos i couldnt see anything for me eyes filling up
All you guys deserve all success that comes your way! This is also a goal of mine to do with my parents. I look forward to watching this channel grow and more success to come!
Garrett your just a straight up solid ass dude. I watch all your vids on good good and just recently discovered you and you genuinely just attract not just great ppl but great energy as well. Look forward to all the upcoming content. ⛳️🏌️
Thats really nice of you. Sharing is caring. Your parents seem really nice and down to earth folks. And your mom has a good eye for inyerior decorating!
Well done buddy.  Super touching moment. Super proud moment!
You’re a wonderful son Garrett, I could only dream of doing something like that. Over here losing it too.
I don’t know you. First time watching one of your videos. As a parent of 2, you seem like a wonderful young man. Kudos to you and your parents. I wish you all the best.
Big thumbs up! Congrats.
You sir are a TRUE Gent. amazing.
This is fantastic. Well done
First class, young man... First class...
You won my views for life man, love it!
This video is exactly why you're crushing it.. you're genuinely a really good dude!
❤️💪🏼
I’m 63. I like that you are such an appreciative young man. All of you guys are awesome. Keep up the good work.
Wow Garrett your humbleness is inspiring let alone you and the guys passion for golf props to you mate
Started watching GoodGood videos after seeing your videos with Rick Shiels. Love the content you guys are making. Such a lovely thing to do for your parents. You deserve all the success Garrett! GoodGood are seriously doing great things for golf. 👏🏻
GARRETT THIS WAS AN AMAZING VIDEO TO SHARE WITH ALL OF US!!!!!    I want to thank you for being so candid with us and be this open with us as viewers. A Great moment for you and your parents.
Loved watching this brought a tear to my eyes as well well done lad love all the content as well
Respect
The other guy's must hate you because there parents will be wanting  $100000. Now you have done it there have to.
Best thing I ever seen. This is why I love the good good guys. I will always support them
Well done bro, you did the right thing here and did what is not easy to do but so easy to do at the same time. Hard to make it through that one lol. Just became a fan of all the golf channels recently but this just showed up on my feed and im glad I watched.
Legend 🤙🏾
Amazing!
There is nothing more rewarding then making your parents proud and repaying them for all their sacrifices. Awesome, congratulations.
This was amazing. Now I want to do this someday with my parents because you inspired me.
Would love to be able to give back to my folks, couldn't afford to nor put a price on it. Hopefully one day
I needed this today bro.   To know there are good people out there, even if it's just a small fraction of our population, reinvigorates my hope. I'm happy for you, truly.
tears of gratefulness.
Young man you are a very special person, a real credit to your parents.someone that recognises the sacrifices parents make for their children. I have only recently started to watch your videos and really do enjoy them. I am a Youtuber as well but struggle to get subscribers if you have any tips that would be great. My channel is way way different to yours. Keep up the great work with Good Good and you stay close and stay close to your mums and dad's and all your families. Good luck to you all. From Kevin's Rambles
The fact your mom read the card before even looking at that check says alot about her! That’s awesome!
Your a Good Good Man Garrett and that’s because of how your parents raised you. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Your a special person Garrett
im not crying, you're crying
Garrett Clark, you are such a good man! ❤
Your crying and I have goose bumps you were brought up well by your parents
This is awesome
Amazing gesture. Beautiful moment. You have an amazing support system both family and friends. Great content. Your parents must be so proud. Loved this. Well done.
you really got me out here crying in my bed on a monday morning
🥹
Honestly, Clout chancing at its finest. This should’ve been done in private, would’ve been more genuine
Love Garrett. Seems like the nicest guy ever
Man!! Congrats buddy!! What a tear jerker
honestly choked me up. ive been watching you since your first few thousand subs and always been my favorite
Wow that hit hard
Wait you guys have parents?
Amazing moment. Garrett is a good kid and his parents did a fantastic job raising this young man. I wish you continued success and keep up the good content. I'll keep watching if you keep bringing out good content
My parents did this for me every week
SIMPY AWESOME 👏👏👏
YOU GUYS ARE TRULY AMAZING!!!!! THANK YO...PRAYERS FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY AND ALL AMERICANS
That was so beautiful. Amazing parents and son.
what the heck, son?!
Great video man… You guys are the best
Beautiful man...
Awesome people
Who’s cutting onions?? 😳😳 u seem like a genuinely nice guy and deserve all your success!
Ferarris are for men who don't have ⛳ a set of clubs and a beautifull piece of land is all a man needs
I'm relatively new to your channel and I immediately thought you seemed like a good kid and so genuine.  I've actually never commented on YouTube before. I am a father to two little ones and your relationship to your parents is magical, something I share with mine as well. Thanks for sharing and staying humble - a trait I wish for so many others. Thanks for sharing.
Salute u idol,u guys r da best...watch your videos everyday
As a seventy year old Vietnam Veteranold I have discovered GoodGood Golf on line. I am totally impressed by the humbleness, and grace with which each of you have and how you each are not forgetting your roots. I have been worrying about what I call the "youth of America" and the future of our country. After spending many sleepless nights watching videos from Tig, Grant, Bubbie, Steven, Matt and yourself,  I realize I can rest easy knowing the younger generation has their priorities straight. Thanks from an old Army Vet. As the song says "Always stay humble and kind". It is always about faith and choices. MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS EACH OF YOU!
WONDERFUL
LFG GARRETT!!!
Kudos Garrett! This is what life is about! Show the people you love what they mean to you! My 3 boys and myself love watching gm golf and good good golf.
My father was a huge influence in my amateur golf career, so I totally get why this was so emotional.(I'm not crying you're crying) This is fantastic and even though Im an older person, I really enjoy your brand and content. Keep doing what you're doing.
Garret thank you for being there for all of us you are the best love you man
You’re a good kid G
Simply awesome....stand proud
Beautiful man
It’s easy to see how you turned out to be the incredible human you are with beautiful parents like that. Yourself and the good good family are a true inspiration, thanks for the tears man you put the G in Legend.
This is how you know you raised your kid right.  Not the money but the love and emotion you feel from this kid for his family.
I can see your parents are proud of you and your achievements so far, mate. That's a credit to the way they raised you. Isn't it great to be able to give something back 🙂💙🏌
That was awesome
Quality people
love u garrett
Bro ...😢... 💙💙💙💙💙💙👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
What a great video!
You done great job for your parents. Well done
That's pretty fucking cool Garrett!  Well done mate!!
I'm not crying, you're crying
Thank you for not adding the corny music, that was real and true.
You are such a great person. Thanks for all. Greeting from Cologne Germany🙂
Class move, Garret
He's a "good good" kid.  Atta boy G-RAT! 10/10
Well done lad, thats what real men do !
Completely off subject but is Micah ( probably butchered the spelling) not the chilliest dude in the world. This man is changing his parents life and he is just chillin sipping a cup of coffee he clearly just made at Garett's parents house. lol. Gotta be dope having friends like the good good crew.
G-man lookin stacked
Well done, young man. Your parent's did a great job with you ... the love shows. The love grows. ❤️
Jesus im crying on a Sunday night ….
Making bank and still be able to stay humble! Big up and greetings from Sweden, if you’re ever to come and play here in Stockholm hit me up so i can learn a thing or two.🏌️‍♂️
Woow .. very proud. Good one Grant
“Just being you is a gift Enough for us” your blessed with amazing parents man
this is awesome. i’ve always wanted to do this
Class gesture, topman family first ❤️
you're a person who people will look up to just by this example of your generous gift to your parents. blood is thicker than water and this was a great video to watch Garrett
The emotion you have and how humble you are is something amazing, keep being you, and just amazing video. Hopefully everyone can learn something from this.
Better then any mr beast video
Young people today could learn a lot from you. Some dad out there is gonna hit the son in law lottery with you
Such a great story... Choked me up 🥺 very honest and heartwarming. Congratulations young man on your success and God willing many many more victories to come for you and all you touch. Thank you! 🙏😎🇺🇸
Well done Garrett! You are the man! You have a pretty mom.
🙏❤️  G-Rat
Who’s cutting onions!
I am not crying...fricking hot in here and my eyes are sweating.  You have great parents and they have done an awesome job raising you man.  I know how to recognize them because I have a couple just like them.  On days when I am feeling sorry for myself for whatever silly reason, I eventually come around to remembering how blessed I am to have the family that I do...awesome parents...an awesome sister and a wonderful wife and daughter.   There is no amount of money or fame or fortune that can touch that.  You obviously get that and I am glad that you are able to give back to your folks.  I am a recent subscriber and have really been enjoying the golf stuff but this one is the one I will remember the most.  Thanks for sharing.
Just awesome
Cool bro👍🏻
This was beautiful. Thanks for sharing this and being vulnerable enough to show the emotions.
This is awesome and very motivating.
Honoring your parents by giving back to them shows me to your personal values & principles. You're "Good Good" in my book! Respect! 👍🙂🏌️
So cool man! What a dream, and your hard work is paying off in the best way.
nothing better than what I just saw!!    ❤🙏
it literally gives me chills. I can't do much to help than subscribe right away. Way to go G.
I've been watching good good for a whole like 2 months. And I'm fockin crying fack lol. So amazing.
I'm not crying, you're crying. OK, we're all crying.
<3
Great way of remembering your beginnings and the people that support you!!! I have seen G giving a new set to his dad and just because of those great actions I’ll support you as well by buy some of your polos. Thank you for great content.
Brilliant thing to do 👏
there must be some dust in the room here
Only real men will show emotions, that includes tears of humility, sorrow, joy. Well done G! PS: Remember to thank the one who can give direction to your life, I think you know who HE is.
Wow! So awesome!!
That's Awesome! You're Awesome! It's Very Cool To See Something Like This. I Started Making Real Good Money At My Job Past Few Years And Kept It To Myself. Then Started Doing Some Things For My Folks To Help Them As They Get Older And Paying For Things That Come Up Like New A/C Units etc... Nothing On The Level You Did, Not Even Close, And It Really Makes You Feel Great Inside! My Mother Is German And My Folks Haven't Been Able To Travel Due To Covid, And I Paid For A Lot Of That And In 3 Weeks They'll Fly Out. It's Really A Special Thing To Give Back Like That!!! Thanks For Sharinng!
this is what it's all about...congrats buddy...absolutely loved how your mom put the check aside first before reading the card...priceless and precious
man I am so fucking glad I found grant and the whole good good squad. genuine dudes, amazing for the game.
Garrett you are absolutely amazing. Made me cry just hearing you talk about it. I wish I could have done something this special for my parents. My father passed last year and the best I coukd give was my love and spending time woth him which is all he needed but this is simply amazing. Cried the entire time woth tears of joy just imaging how that must have felt. I love your videos and all the good good crew. Keep doing you man. So much love
After watching that, I had to subscribe. Thumbs up from NC!
Awesome
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Now your just showing off. Good stuff.
Not gonna lie, definitely cried. Or maybe I had something in my eye 🤣. Great moment. Thanks for sharing
You’re making me cry!
Love that your mom said “I’m gonna rip this up” “you being you is enough”! Shows how good a kid Garrett is!
And this is why I subscribe.  Good people deserve support.
this shows how amazing your parents are.
Beautiful......Be thankful as well your parents are around as both of mine are gone now and life is so short...so happy for you and the ability to have this moment.
IMHO you should have kept this private Garrett.
Great video. Giving back to your parents it's an amazing thing. I was already a fan of your videos.
This is why you guys are great. Family content, clean content and you love what you are doing.
I can’t love this more
Good family
im not crying your crying..
I hope this makes up for the pan
Hell yes! 🤘🏼
You're a good dude, man. Props to you and your buddies and your families.
Is everyone listening? A supportive Mother and Father will produce winners. Successful, productive members of society. Congratulations to Mom and Dad on this one. You did beyond a great job.
I’m going to do the same thing and come back to this channel, don’t ever delete this…I’ll be back
Well done young man. You and the guys set a great example and a moment that will live long in many peoples memories.
don't do this kind of shit on camera
As someone who has watched your GM Golf channel since you were at 10k, this video is impossible to watch without tearing up. You’ve came so far. We are all proud of you brother.
Love this
This was so wholesome
Well, I have a whole new respect for this guy right here. Garrett never change!
so amazing, what a feeling
Your dads right.  You guys touch a lot of lives (and not just kids)  I turned 51 today, never miss a Good Good vid.  You guys bring joy (and tears now).
U guys are awesome man
dang bro I had to pause it so I didn't cry and I never cry! I hope I can do this for my parents one day
perfect example of what happens when you raise your child right...not just the money, but how he carries himself
Your talent is always impressive (and you’re cute) but what really gets me is the genuine love and appreciation you feel for your mom and dad. Seeing your tears made me cry.  You are truly grateful and for your parents and all they’ve done to encourage you. You’ve used the opportunities they’ve provided and grown something amazing from it all. I hope to meet someone like you. You’re a good one - a good good one 😉 God bless
The sweetest video ever, brought me to tears 🥺
Greatest guy on YouTube without a doubt. Love this guy
Way to go Garrett!!! Hell yes man! This is a HUGE moment in your life!! Proud of you bub. You and your team keep on keepin YouTube alive!!!
Great job Garret.  We all wish we had this ability.  As I always knew...you are a great guy!
LOVE YEW GARRETT
Genuine and just absolute appreciation. Proud of you doing all that you have done and continue to do G. Keep that grind and that humbleness. All thumbs up
❤️❤️❤️
You’re an inspiration brother! Keep it up! I’ve been watching since before goodgood and you got me to take golf more seriously and now I love golfing. We share the dream of being able to give back to family. Keep it up!
me tryan scrape money together to afford a sand wedge 🧍🏽‍♂️
Must feel like a champ💪💪💪 Keep up the great content!!
you are one of the few people that i think deserve the best future man. congrats to you brother!
What a blessing
that camera is nice
God is good 🙌
Honor thy mother and father.   This is why you will succeed brother
Tammy is gonna be upgrading that straw bag 🤣 so happy for you man! Been watching since 2016, so cool to see you and all the guys grow into what you’ve become. Keep grinding 💪🏾
I love the fact that your mom cherished that card before she even considered looking at the check. Genuine and grateful family. Amazing
This is what its all about, giving back to the ones that invested in you. Allways this first, THEN you splurge on yourself with stuff like cars and shit
Said this on Grant's video... same applies here: It's said that "money is the root of all evil"... but I am of the belief that money simply amplifies one's character. In your case, it's amplifying the good that is within you.  Keep up the good work.  Also:  does that backyard green still exist?  We wanna see!
Amen! You’re a good man Garrett.
These gosh darn stinkin allergies
You are Real dude. I choked up myself watching this. I’d give back to my parents too if I had the money. You’re a great dude!
Garret is this giveaway legit? Shortlist giveaway for a gps caddy and a 2 iron? Or is this a scammer?
Y’all got people trying to scam folks in the comments
This is what honor, character, love, respect, gratitude, selflessness and a TRUE MAN looks like!!!!!!!  Mad respect for you Garrett!!!!!!!  God Bless!!!!!
Incredible Garrett! Love your story. Absolutely an inspiration.
This man got me into golf and I couldn’t appreciate him more
Couldn’t help but cry for this one
Thanks for sharing this moment young man and good on you for recognizing how hard and costly it is to raise a child!  Even though I'm old enough to be most of yall's dad, I really hope to meet the Good Good team someday if you're ever in PHX (my swing needs your help!) This team provides the best golf content, hands down! Cheers and well done good sir 👍
I’m glad as hell I’m watching this at home alone 🥹 atta boy G.
What a moment, Garrett!  I've followed you for years and your growth has been tremendous.  Your parents raised a genuine good person.  Keep inspiring people, my man!  Cheers.
This is why support the Good Good brand! Such wholesome and awesome content!
Pure awesomeness!!!!!! Your the man!
Good job young man! Awesome!
Bless you Garrett!
You’re the man. I tried my best to keep it together too. Keep being yourself and being an inspiration to so many. At the end of the day there is nothing more important than family and it is such an amazing thing to be able to give back. Much love from Tampa, FL!!!!!
That’s awesome Garrett. Well done mate. 👏🏽👏🏽
Way to go, man.
Bruh my heart..😢
I mean, emotionally satisfying but yeah Dad has a good point about the annual tax gift limits haha.
What an amazing heart he has. Christ is with him. Keep leading man. God with you
incredible.
Awesome 💯
Wow Garrett your folks must be proud to have a son like you, great attitude, great morals, I pray for great success for you and the good good team.
Best video ever
humble man, doing humble things. Could only dream of doing something of that nature. Congrats to all the boys of Good Good, changing the game of golf, and the community in a positive way.
And whats the point of doing that unless you make a video about it right?
My guy!!! Congrats 👏 💖
ive watched this about 20 times and i cry each time, such a beautiful thing. you and all of good good are beautiful people
You’ve inspired me to the max Clarky. helped me through since tough times by just producing some great videos to relieve my stress..
Always watch your videos to wake up and sip my coffee to because it is such good content and always so easy to watch. You are such a genuine dude! Got me tearing up at 7am before the gym man hahah! Keep striving for greatness.
Damn it! Got me teary eyed...  Well done Garrett!  It is awesome to always appreciate those who helped us along the way -- especially our parents.
Got me 😢 beautiful mate.
Man!  Blast from the past.  Me and a few friends stayed with Jerry and Tami 30 ish years ago with a WCBC church youth group.  So good seeing them again. What great people.  And now I watch their kid on youtube.  surreal.
I remember the first few videos you put up and your father was tagging along with a camera. Later you were doing crazy things in your putting course that wrapped around the back of the house. And your dad did that? For you?  Well that's easy to explain. You are your parents greatest and most devoted fan. I'm a fan probably for the same reason.  Along with the Good Good team and how crazy you guys can get I see how you really love your friends. And I get really charged up when I see them return their love to you. And now your parents get to appreciate how well their son has grown.  Thanks for letting us be a part of this really feel good video.
Just a grown man (and father) sobbing on a Tuesday in Canada. I’ve followed GoodGood for almost a year and tell everybody, because your content is perfect for the “every-fan”, and these videos re-ignited my passion for golf.  To see all the love and support in this video makes it easy to understand why you and the GoodGood crew have all been so successful. Forever grateful to support. Keep doing “Good”!
You're a good man there Clark.
Great job man, I can see how proud your parents are of you. As a parent I could feel that emotion, I even teared up watching it.
Deserved man!
I wish I could have done that for my dad. He was gone before I reached your age. Good on you Garrett. :)
Can I be your dad?
Garrett... What a moment. I got a chill from this. Thank you for sharing this moment. Love your content.
Damn bro you made me cry wtf Congrats on everything you’re the man
Cool video. Very awesome. You know the parents are gonna probably stash it for him for rainy day.
Great accomplishment Garrett!   Your parents are proud of you.
Awesome kid!!
That is bad a$$, I'm glad that your that humble
This is one of the greatest, most wholesome videos I've ever seen. Good for you man!
Dude, this video brought tears to my eyes. To see the person you are on and off the course is a blessing to everyone. Congratulations for being able to do that for your parents, that's gotta be one of the best feelings in the entire world. You're a fantastic dude
My dream was to have a real family this made me tear up, I know I’ll never experience the feeling of love and support however this brought me close to the reality of belonging in a family. Best for the future.
Beautiful moment
You guys are fine young men
Wow! Very nice. Will you be my son? LOL.
Welp, I didnt know I was going to cry today. You're the man for this.
You did a real good thing young man
I’ve only been following you and good good for like 3 weeks and seeing your moms reaction made me tear up. You and your squad are awesome, don’t stop doing what you’re doing G!
Good Good dudes are such good people. Couldn’t be happier for a group of dudes on their success!!
Garrett is such a great young man. It's nice to see that emotion towards your parents, great person raised by some great people. Awesome job man.
Really cool to see other guys from Good Good there supporting. You can really tell these guys want the best for each other. Never let business get in the way of that friendship and continue to be your genuine selves.
This is what its all about. Good stuff Garrett.
If your video gets 10 million views, you will largely have paid for this check.  You didn't have actual checks and had to ask your dad for a check?  It sounds like a fake check to me.
"You are gift enough for the both of us", your Mom has a beautiful soul. I'm so proud of you Garret and I'm proud of your parents for raising such an amazing young man. I look forward to a bright future for you and the team.
Maybe the best thing I’ve ever seen
Garrett, you’re a great young man. You should be so proud of yourself. I guarantee your parents are!  Keep up the great work and keep kickin ass!
I wasn’t planning on getting misty eyed on a Wednesday afternoon!
dude you made me cry!
Damn man... I was just trying to watch some golf. Now I'm crying
Top man, love this channel.
Love your channel Garrett and the whole GoodGood crew. Great content and entertaining but the best part of it is, you guys are good people. This video reinforces what I already thought. Your folks did a great job!  You had me a little choked up as well. Congrats and keep up the great work!
Goals 🫶🏼✨
If you dont get emotional talking about your mom and dad then you got problems. Anyone that gives you static abot get emotional well that's THIER problem.
Amazing to be able to give back to your parents and seeing how genuine and grateful you are! Love watching the videos!
Brilliant ❤️
i totally respect you for this and i will remain a life long fan!
What a good person! Congrats on the success Garrett!
gayyyyy
I want to do that some day too
Garrett is such a good dude. Always gives off such good vibes, and so humble. 🙏
I'll give you a hug for $100,000
absolutely incredible
This is one of the best YouTube videos I may have ever seen
What a guy 👏🏻
I’m 38 years old and I gotta tell u Garrett, I’ve been watching u since the beginning and ur an inspiration to so many people especially new young kids getting involved with golf! I got choked up watching this man! Truly incredible!

I lost it at two minutes when He did.  What a great video!
Legend man awesome video
You're such a good dude man. I absolutely love following you and Good Good and even though I'm 24 myself I still look up to you guys so much. I think you guys have been so successful not only because of how good you guys area at the game, but because you are such good people at heart too. I hope one day I have the means to be able to give back to my parents the same way you were able to give back to yours. Congratulations on all the success man you deserve it and you inspire a lot of people to be the best version of themselves. Thank you for just being you
This is so wholesome! Congrats man!! ❤️
That was an awesome blessing what you done for your parents. I feel blessed just to have gotten to watch it happen. Always keep GOD first stay true to yourself and love as much as possible. All you guys at Good Good are awesome men doing awesome things! Keep it up!
Loved the gift tax/accounting reference that you mentioned inadvertently, as I’m studying for my CPA right now. Wholesome video, Congrats on accomplishing a lifelong goal!
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!  Well done, Garrett!
Congrats to you, Garrett.  For being able to do something like that at such a young age.  Stay humble and keep rocking.  Well done.
You are an amzing son.You and your friends wil go places,thats for sure.The thing i dont get,the irs wont allow you just to give them the 100k,that you have worked hard for and deicided to pay back to your wonderfull parents.

Awesome video
As a Parent and a grandfather, the one prayer we have for our children, is not what they give us, but that they have good hearts and souls. God bless.
That’s awesome man! So happy for you and all the guys that you’re able to do this sort of stuff and just your job is something you love :)
I teared up not gonna lie
I don’t think I have ever  commented on a YouTube video before, but felt the need for this one. I started playing around June 2017, and shortly there after found your channel. I would look forward to the course vlogs at Sunflower. I remember the one with the mobile tee where you guys drove around hitting tee shots from a trailer. The hole in one challenges, range sessions at your girlfriends college practice range, bro 5, etc. this brings a lot of joy to see you be able to do this and continue killing it man. Congrats, but you worked hard for it. Hope to see you continue to strive going forward.
Bro i am crying with you at my desk.  Congrats big man.  you deserve this!
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING!
oh bud this was such a bad idea
Wow, very wholesome
This had me crying. Garret and his parents are too pure.
Your a good dude man! Nice work man!
I remember that green on ig.... Your a game changer, true pioneer
so nice to see you so humble man. best of luck with your future broski.
Love this man Good stuff💯
Respect to you! Continue your work that you do, you are a idol for many people! I’m from Sweden, watch you guys see what you have done it’s amazing, coming to Florida in juli and play golf with my girl. Wish you the best!
This just made my day! You’ve done what I can only hope to one day do for my parents. You and the good good boys inspire me personally all the time and I thank you for it!
WE LOVE YOU GARRETT
This was absolutely AWESOME!! GoodGood things happen to GoodGood people!!
And grant
Jerk the tears right out of my face with a good good.  Garrett Micha Bubby Steve mat all the background guys go do great things
Completely gangster!
Unreal👏🏻
You are a fine young man. So enjoy all of your videos.
Absolute legend
Amazing!!!
This video hit home for me. Been a dream of mine for a couple years now. Someday I hope to do this for my parents.
garrett’s living our dream
Awesome dude. I have been watching you for years now! I actually met you as well at the OMNI hotel in OKC when I was working valet! This is great to see.
The most wholesome part of this is that Garrett's Mom sees the check and just moves it to keep reading the note. That's how you know she means it when she says "just being you is a gift enough for us". Beautiful stuff.
Very special moment.
This is why this guy is a legend
And this is why I continue to watch and support you and all the guys. You might be these big YouTubers but you are all so humble. Love you guys and all the content. Thank you for being great!
Awesome man! You have a good heart bro.
May God continue to bless you and all those around you!
I'll give you a big kiss for $100k and I'm not even gay. Not there is anything wrong with that(Seinfeld reference). Ha
Awesome!!  I love watching all your stuff and I even watch all the ads.  This is just freaking fantastic!
Humility and gratitude. God will lead you to blessings.
What a proud father moment hope I’m able to do something like this one day
It’s okay to cry G. Special moment!
When you realized you made it
Garrett, you say you read these or atleast you did before you blew up. I hope you still do my friend. I have been a fly on the wall for your whole life. I watched u when u were small and then when u got big. (Congrats btw.) I dont ever comment nor reveal my position as fly on the wall but I watched this video and I have to ask you Garrett.  Are you happy? You look sleep deprived and you have gray hair shooting out your hat. Your parents will agree Garrett, tear the check up and give your parents a hug. Stop killing yourself in Hope's that you will someday be happy. Be happy today Garrett. Tomorrow is no guarantee. U search for holes is your game and how to shave a stroke then take a look at the tao de ching. I hope u read this, I never comment on here. U r a good guy Garrett and I would love to whoop your ass in a round of golf if u ever wanna give your fans a memorable 18 holes go ahead and put your big boy pants on and let's go!
congrats you deserve this
7:08 caught me so off guard I didn’t know half the Good Good squad was in the room 😂😭
5:10 I couldn’t hold it either 😭😭😭
Let it out man! Let it out! 😂🙏🏼
Just. WOW!
I am thankful to have gotten lucky and won a massive life changing sports bet.  I relate to this so much because I’ve always wanted to give back and after the win I was able to get my friends and family who did so much for me some nice things and help them all out myself! Proud of you G!!! You deserve every bit of it 🙏🏼
Millennials will never admit it but we all DREAM about doing something like this for our parents. You are someone to look up too brother, keep making an impact 👊👊
Should have bought a car
Best video you ve made. First class kid!
I think I would feel weird as a parent. I'd want to just give it back or put it in savings for that child for when that child inevitably crashes and burns due to drugs, alcohol and taxes
Big up G Rat
Man I have always wanted to give back to my mom because she had done so much for me. Unfortunately she passed in 2020 of Leukemia and I was never able to pay back all that she had done for me. What you are doing is a great thing as a son and as a man.
Really great stuff G!!!! If you're ever in the Toronto area, I'll cover the round of golf hahaha
God is good 🙏🏻 Good job Garrett, keep doing your thing brother and don’t ever forget God and how He has blessed you guys. The World will try to deceive you from this and this is just the beginning, keep God first priority is your only chance to avoid the deceptions.
Someone is chopping a lot of onions my eyes are streaming man
Dude. I'm so glad you didn't hold it together. We live in a society that promotes emotion as weakness and I strongly believe it is the opposite. Your show emotion is the real you. That's how much you love and appreciate your parents. I pray that my kids can grow up and have the amount of respect and integrity that you do. Your parents are a big part of that. Very cool video. Thanks for sharing this side of you.
Jeez Garrett, why am I sat here crying! What an incredible gesture. You are a true gentleman and you can tell your parents are immensely proud of you, and rightly so, you are a credit to them.  Keep grinding
You know they're good people when she read the note before even looking at the dollar amount on the check
Honestly this is the best video I've ever seen you in.  Good on you for giving back to the people who love and support you the most.  Happy to see you guys in DFW, I live in Fort Worth.  Always hoping to run into you guys on a course one day.  If you ever set up a scramble tournament,  I am 100% in and will bring several teams.  Congrats man!
Good for you bud
this is way much cooler than getting a sport car, you will get there one day eventually
Man from just grant and tig to this. It’s so insanely awesome to see. Best part is none of em have ever changed. None of em let the fame and money change them. Absolutely love it
Its funny how money can create insane emotions but ultimately the emotions come from the hard work, time, success and pride. cheers GM
Hey Garret I'm a big fan from down under Australia.. Just wanna say congratulations and you're a legend mate!!
Awesome man! So happy for you
Good man Garrett Clark.
fuckin legend
Love this, but yah you changed my life and the perspective of golf now watch gold everyday and try to play everyday
You are such a great guy and role model Garett! It must run in the family, your parents seem wonderful ❤🥲
Crazy thing is that he's going to make that 100k back in a few weeks lol
Love it, I cried watching this..... Great man, love you for this. God Bless you.
Dreams coming true, happy for you man keep killing it and living your best life
Wow man straight waterworks even from a grown man that doesn’t really know you.
At your age I was a scratch golfer... I stopped playing when my wife got MS.. watching all you GG guys play golf made me start again 20 years later.... thank you xx from a 50 yr old that still loves golf  ...uk
Who put these onions on my desk??!
You the man bro
So happy for you garrett, you are one hell of a man for doing that in the early stages of the career God has planned for you!! keep up he hard work man, so inspirational love yall guys!❤️
Amazing!!!!🙌🏼
This video made my day. You're the best, G!
This is legit Garrett. Congrats my boy.
Very cool G!   Surreal moment happened at a store last weekend when I saw someone wearing a GoodGood hat all the way in Yakima, Washington!   Your guys influence is far and wide and I’m happy to be a part of it. Love the content and continued success to you and the crew. 👊🏻🏌🏻
Incredible stuff you and the rest of Good Good do for the golf community.  What a touching thing to watch and support.  Congrats Garrett!!!
You the man Garret
Nice work dude! Keep giving! Stay humble, and be kind. Connect with everyone and "try" to understand their thoughts/situation. Only helps you grow.
“Just being you is a gift enough for us; it pays us everyday” 🥺
Bro I am at work.. I can't be crying at work man.
Respect G-Rat
Tammy was DEFINITELY not pissed
Well done mate. This would be the first thing I would do to, our parents do soo much and spend so much on our sport as kids that they deserve to be looked after!
Garrett, you are a true gentleman, I am almost 69 and I'm an avid fan of good good. All you guys are an inspiration to golfers young and old. Your'e all great golfers, great characters, great mates and best of all great human beings..love you guys. Keep flying the flag for all countries and as you so aptly put it...Peace out!
They did something right with you G. So humble and grateful at such a young age. Keep up the good work man. Much love
Tammy is out of the strawbag and she is definitely not pissed!
Proud of you Garret, been following you for 3-4 years i believe, back when Steve and Matt were first appearing in your vids, and you guys have really reinvigorated golf for me, it coincided with me coming back to the game after a 18-20 year break (i'm 35) And i gotta say it's been a blast to see the fun you guys are having with golf. Golf is a great sport, but a boring game, you guys made it into a Great sport and a Great Game(s) plural in fact, because you invented your own "Game modes" and that's just down right awesome. Love your vids, wish you guys all the best and keep them coming. I'm very happy to have been a part of the journey since the days of "yor" :D hehe.   Now get your butts over to us in Europe for a Europe Tour :D!
Been following you guys for a year now - Best Video Ever :-) Keep shining!!!
“you changed a lot of lives” indeed you have and way more than you could imagine. Keep up the good work Garrett your a true inspiration to the youth of golf.
Tammy can afford some new pans that Matt ruined!
Great video Garrett… made me cry!
Damn allergies.
Amazing Garrett! You’re one of the few that keep me striving and pursuing golf each and every time I play! Don’t ever stop man
Congrats Garrett! Deserved <3 By the way, America still using checks?!
WHAT A GUY
So cool!
I'm not crying, you're crying :)
Am I gonna cry!? Yeesssssss.
Thank you for sharing that beautiful moment with us.  Hopefully everyone of you guys will be able to do that for your parents someday.
That was awesome! Thank you and God bless you all!
Man, this randomly popped up on my recommendations & this makes me want to work harder with my content to be able to do this for my mom one day! Thank you!
The biggest gift to your parents is the person you have turned out to be.
You’re a wonderful and humble young man. I’m glad I clicked to subscribe to your channel. 😎
You are a wonderful young man and human.  I am glad my 11 yr old son loves watching your videos. Keep up the good work
Unbelievable Garret. Truly a inspiration man.
It rhymes with checkbook!
You touched me doing this your a good person and it’s amazing that your giving back
Good on you Garrett
Cant believe I cried over a video about a guy I’ve never met. But I did. Garrett you truly are an inspiration to anyone and everyone and I really can’t thank you enough for everything you’ve taught me. We are the same age and I look up to you just because of how humble and charismatic you are. Keep doing you man. Changing lives everyday. GSR for life👍🏼
You're a good kid mate. Your parents would be so proud of the young man you've become. Onwards and upwards  mate. Good stuff👍🏼
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congrats man that's an amazing feat and amazing you could do that.
You can’t be making me cry like that at work man!!  Congratulations Garrett  You deserve this and will be riding with you till the end!!
Your dad is so right. Changed my life. Haven't stopped hitting golf balls since I found your GM Golf Channel. Thank you Garrett.
Garrett Clark you and the Good Good Golf family are a huge inspiration. This brought me tears to see what you did for your parents, and to see your Good Good Golf family always being there for each other. I hope I can do something like that one day.
Showing your parents love, should involve tears. It shows you truly care. Great job.
Hell yeah my man !! This is incredible. Congratulations, you’re a great person!
Love this.
I'm not crying , it's just dusty in here.
this is awesome man! congrats and glad you got some awesome parents and gave back to them 👌🏻
congrats, although i don't think your folks were struggling lol
Your parents raised you right.. congrats 👏   I am curious how your parents raised you.
that... was amazing.
We the fans may help, but it's all your hard work dude, love the emotions, humble and greatful, but it's all you guys, congrats on the success, you deserve it.
This is what life is all about. Kudos, G.
This awesome Garrett, congrats bro!
Made me freaking cry dammit! :''(
Awesome
I loved all the the stuff you guys do and look forward to watching it but plz don't make me cry like this again ( aka love it )
Incredible stuff man, Stuff of dreams. Congrats on the success. If you're ever in Ireland let's go for a round
You’re such an inspiration man, I’ve watched you guys from the beginning. This is so awesome man
Outstanding moment 👏
Man… this is amazing.
I've watched a lot of amazing Good Good content, but for me, this video is at the top! Well done Garrett (and crew)!
So weird how I started this video and got a sudden allergy attack that made my eyes water severely. Weird.
What a good young man. Hats off to your parents for raising you right. This is so refreshing I hope it goes viral and gets all over  mainstream media.  Well done bro
Hey Garret, Congratulations man! This video is fantastic! This is a moment that not many people get to experience but I am sure really wish they could. You have worked so hard to get to where you are today and you immediately think of your parents just comes to show the kind of person you truly are. During the video, I heard your father talk about God and being the root of where you are today. I am just wondering if that's how you feel and I would be highly interested to hear more about that and how God plays a role in your life today!
I started crying watching this on the building site wasn’t the best look but such  awesome moment for you to have together love ya content
One of my favourite vids I’ve seen from all you guys
🙏🏿Blessed!!!!
Wow this was fucking awesome
That's awesome brother, made me tear up too
Some damn good parents raised a damn good young man.  I'm proud of you G.
I had a few tears come to my eyes good job man,been watching you for 3 years now and this is just awesome to see bro good job
How dare you make me cry in my living room! Such a genuine person and family
hope yet for our country!
you're a fkn legend Garrett, and a good as son. Keep bein you homie
This is the best video you have ever made. Great work. Hit home.
That was so awesome! Garrett, don’t ever stop hugging your parents. They raise a great young man. Cherish every moment you get to spend with them. Thanks for making your videos. They but a smile on my face. And inspires me to try to get better at golf.
Much love brother, doing great things <3
This hit home so much for me because forever I have yearned for the moment that you just had. There is no greater time then to give back to 2 people that created and sacrificed to make you who you are today. The feeling that you got to have knowing your parents are truly proud of you is like no other. I losy my dad to brain cancer when I was 20 years old. He was my best friend in this world and I did everything for those moments of knowing he was proud of me. I'll never hear it ever again nor see that look your dad gave you and feels about you that he expressed. Such a great moment for you and  happy for you. Cherish every moment you have with them because they go before you know it and you will never be the same. Keep being you man.
Awesome Garrett.  Keep grinding my man!  Thanks to you and your dad for the help in growing my channel and my PTSD Mission for first responders.  And Ms. Tami is great as well.  And my man Leo can come to the fire station anytime I am on duty.
Good on you Garrett 👏 your a top bloke keep that awesome level of modesty and you will be around for a long time good luck !
This is awesome man I’m super happy you were able to do something so nice for those who have done so much
You're an amazing man G, a beautiful soul, keep up the amazing content❤️
This is awesome man. brought me to tears!! Its been great watching you over the years and watching you become the man and golfer you are today!!
Great job Garrett. We all appreciate you from the bottom up. You and all of Good Good❤️Much love
Awesome!!!
Quit saying thank you to us, this is due to your hard work Garrett. You deserve everything good that’s coming your way!
Congrats man! Here’s that attention you needed.
Garrett this is so awesome! Huge kudos to you for using your platform for good and being an example of taking care of the people that got you to where you are. You are a great role model to the next generation
This is the reason I'm happy i support you and the GG web site. Happy story
Great thing to do for your folks.  Pathetic for publicizing it
Legend
Amazing dude, Great people get rewarded
What an amazing blessing! Garrett what you did is not just giving back but the realization of becoming a man with heart. Your parents were proud of you long before this, and the content of your character shows in each video.
I’m buying my parents a house to own one day and my step dad the nicest watch thank you
Beautiful moment
Hopefully you can give them many more $100,000 checks in the future.  You earned it all.  Love Good Good!
I Hope that 1 day I can meet you and shake your hand. That made me tear up.  My respect to you. I'm not great at golf but I sure would love to play a round with all of you.  Have a great night young man
This is really beautiful Garrett. Your chosen family and your real family are incredibly lucky to have a brother and son that truly cares about them. Regardless of whether you make another $100,000 in your life, you can hold your head high knowing that you've provided and cared for the ones you love. Good stuff G.
All I can say is wow.. 👏👏👏
Insane how you gone from stingers videos, trickshots and videos with your old girlfriend haha to everything with good good. Big respect to you!!!
YouTube pays that good divided by like 6 dudes?
There are so many people (young and old) that take and take and more take ,but you are one of the few that gives back, well done,  the most important thing is it comes from the heart.
ok you got me, I couldn't hold it back.🥲  You're a good guy Garrett, you deserve tons of health and success!
Great to watch what you are you doing! I’m following you and the good good guys and I really love it! I have two kids and give everything to them for their education. I can tell you that parents don’t want to get anything back except of love. You’re a great kid! Wish you all the best
good man. which I could by you a beer.
Pretty messed up you didn’t shout out Brodie Smith
You are bad ass man! Love the whole crew y’all deserve it!
why do you feel the need to tell the whole world ?
Wow, you just made a man who hasn’t cried in years tear up
I wasnt crying, I was sweating through my eyeballs
love these videos parents do so much for us and we never realize it until were older. so happy you were able to do this for them so motivational man keep it up!!
Big W Garrett! Amazing and touching moment! Keep killing it !
Wow man. I also have this goal one day. this hits home.  Thankyou for sharing
been following you for the last 5 years and this is the first comment I've dropped. Actually shredded a tear this video.
Awesome gift. I also hope you understand gift tax on this is going to be ~36,000
G Rat! So dope that you did this. Way to be vulnerable and give back. Respect. Keep grinding.
This is amazing man, you and the rest of the Good Good boys deserve every bit of success you lot are getting, and this is just the beginning. Keep doing your thing Garrett!
Inspiration man, truly truly is.
Most genuine dude on YouTube.
Congrats garret! So inspiring to watch you living out your dreams! Keep it up!
This is amazing brother! I’m so happy for you.
An you give my parents 100,00
Top man mate what a bloke u are ❤️
I didn't plan on crying today. But here I am.
I’m not crying … you are 🥺
Can I get 20 bucks?
Time stops for know one. Not even your own parents. We all grow old enjoy your family while you can.
I Gave My Parents $100,000 GONE WRONG (the check bounces)
"It rhymes with check book" is the absolute greatest line and one I aspire to use as a dad one day
Happy for you man, been around since 2018 watching you play at sunflower, love to see you get to this point man. Good luck in the future dawg.
Who’s cutting onions
Absolutely amazing. So much support for you and yours. Great to see👍
Who’s cutting onions?!?
Without a doubt the coolest video I’ve seen on YouTube. Congratulations and thank you for sharing this moment with the YouTube community.
Awesome man!
Shout out to your Mum being a real one and not even looking at the cheque right away! She wanted to read that card and see the message first. You can tell were her heart is.
absolute legend <3
Interesting how similar your story is with Garret Mitchell from Cleetus McFarland. He did the same thing, dropped out of college to pursue YouTube. Must be a Garrett thing. Also, what a solid example of parents caring enough to help their child pursue their dreams. A true blessing!
Proud of you man, <3
Time to build my son a putting Green…   Just kidding, amazing achievement and what a great video to be able to look back on.
This is awesome. Keep grinding big dawg
I think this is every kids dream. Respect. Brought tears to everyone watching this cool moment.
Garrett, I started watching you guys around the Brodie Smith days and honestly I had a hard time with your approach to golf and your ego. Since then, I have seen you mature, a ton. This gesture was the first in a long line of opportunities that you will have to change lives. Your parents did a great job and they are obviously very proud of you. Congratulations on your success and keep up the great work.
Wow garrett.
This is an awesome thing you did, but you should have done it quietly and kept it a family thing. This isn't anything you should be sharing with the public.
Just awesome, Garrett. Congratulations!
Tacky
You are the shit brother, never change
I'm not crying you're crying
I can’t even tell you how much I love your dad for immediately worrying about your gift tax. Good people. Congrats
Incredible.I cried watching 100.000 thumb up for you Garrett
Is somebody cutting onions?
Enough to make a grown man cry. Proud of you bro 🫶
you are an awsome human being     next gift grand children         i just gave my mom 20 thousand dollars and she said i will pay you back and i just started crying and said no you dont have to you gave me way more then that
Bro you can't make me cry at work what the hell dude
Keep killin it bro. What a special moment that u can share with ur parents and thanks for letting us in on that.
Tami is gonna be IN the straw bag ❤️
Mom and dad did an amazing job with Garrett , amazing young man …
You're an awesome person Garrett, and an even more awesome son. Good on you.... God Bless.
Garret I’m so proud of you for this. It takes a different mindset to want to give back to the people that have got you to where you’re at. We need more people like you in this world thank you for doing what you’re doing keep it up keep that mindset I’m very grateful for who you are man keep it up!
This is freakin awesome man!
This is it right here, well done Garrett 💯
I'm not crying, you're crying.
love your videos and I hope I can do this for my parents some day
❤️❤️❤️ Awesome man
I told you Garrett is so humble. You are awesome man.
Been following you since the beginning man! You’re the man G!
Amazing man
That must have been such a great feeling to give back to your parents, and was so amazingly generous, Garrett. I'd never have understood it until a couple years ago when I myself became a dad, but all we really want is our kids to grow up happy, healthy, and doing what they love. So I'm sure Jerry and Tammy were happy enough with you before the check. But then again, if my son wanted to give me 100k I could certainly use it... although I'd wonder where a 2 yr old came up with 100 Gs 🤣
I pursued a career in music most of my life and I always dreamed of being able to do this for my parents. I am now 35 years old and have yet to be able to do this for them but I try and support them in every way I can. Way to go Garrett! You understand how fortunate you are to have two great parents.
you're a real one for this, G.  i can't imagine how amazing you must feel.  be proud.  you've earned this.
Congrats Garrett, proud of all you guys! Never forget where you came from and the people that were always there for you
This is fantastic...Good for you man!  My dad always tells me he is the dad and can buy beers and dinner and this and that....I refuse to let him for the reasons you've stated.  My parents are the ones who groomed me to be who I am today so giving back is never even a debate in my mind.  You're a great son.  Hopefully you signed the check first though lol  PS...you made this big dumb idiot tear up with a huge smile at the same time lol
aaaaaaaaand now im crying. Thanks G! This was amazing!
Got SO MUCH Sand in my eyes ... you are a good son. Genuinely a role model for kids (and adults) ...
This is so cool, your parents are amazing and have raised you so well. God has blessed y’all so much, and as nice as it is you can tell they don’t even really care abt the money bc their hearts are so pure. Kudos to ya Garrett, u deserve it!
Garrett you are the product of two incredible people & are simply inspirational. The best compliment I can pay you as the Grandfather of two wonderful Granddaughters that I protect with all of my might, is that I pray they meet & marry a man with your qualities that I don't have to chase away with my shotgun. Sir I salute you & wish you continued success with your career. A note to your future, on many occasions you have stated you won't be a PGA pro because you don't handle the pressure. I watched you in front of your first live crowd with Good Good, & you came alive and rose to the occasion, you have it inside you, maybe, just maybe, you ought to reconsider, Pheonix tournament, thousands of spectators, great shot under pressure, we all know how good you are, it's time for you to realise it too. God Bless you Good Good Sir, a magnificent gesture to two wonderful parents, God Bless.
Congratulations Garrett, well done to you and the good good lads. Really inspiring and I'm proud of you bro. keep up the good work and hopefully one day I can do something like that for my parents!!
Dude. You have come so far it's so cool to watch. I remember when upgrading your tripod was a big deal to you and now...the sky is the limit. You and the rest of Good Good are amazing and just keep going!
That’s awesome man! Wholesome asf! 😂❤️
What a great video. So happy for you Garrett
Amazing!
Never comment really, but good on you man
great that you could be so generous to your parents...too bad the IRS will be interested in the transaction lol :(
congrats G, keep going bro👊
I wish I had the support u had growing up tell ur parents how much they mean to u n cherish every moment u have with them
I don't even cry, and look at me, you're about to about to make tears come outta my face!
congrats garrett you have built yourself from the ground up and you’ve earned it. your parents deserve it they are the base of everything
Fair play mate! You’re very humble , big respect 👊, looking after the people that looked after you. All the best for the future , look forward to watching more of your content
brody exposed you
ur fake bro
THIS is why GM golf and Good Good is what it is. Good f'n people. Something in the water there in KC dude.
Beautiful
Something I’ve always wanted to do for my parents as well. My friends and I always talk about starting a YouTube channel doing similar stuff as you guys but we haven’t got it going yet. Proud of you though! God bless you and your parents brother! Been here since day 1!
So happy for you Garrett. Happy to have been able to watch you grow since the beginning.
Such a genuine guy.so cool to see
Good Job  to the parents.   Very good example to the youth Garrett, salute.
You are the man Garrett.  You are a great role model to young kids
Can u say look at me what I did. Narcissistic ring a bell for u. Lol
Keep it up Garrett. You are the man
Great video, when people get money/fame they forget about the people that help get them there especially your parents, don't worry about getting emotional obviously means alot and so it should 👍🏻
Beautiful bro. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Nice job Garrett.
Congrats Garrett
Congrats my man!!!
Your dad said it best God has blessed you.  It is awesome you are able to share the blessing with those you love. Make sure to give God the glory in all of this.
Totally deserved mate couldn't have happened to a nicer person, enjoy everything that's coming your way and to your family
Dang it Garrett! You making us cry through the camera! Glad you were able to do this!
Classy
Brought me to tears man. So happy to see where you have gone. You’re journey has been so much fun to watch. Thanks for letting all of us be a part of this. 🤙🏼❤️
very nice garret
haha mom instantly cries, and dads eyes light up with smile and giggle
Proud of you....this has turned into a way to create generational wealth.  If you were still in college chasing d2 or 3 golf you'd still be struggling and your life would be so different.
This really shows your heart. You are a goodgood man
That was beautiful fellas! Such lovely supportive parents..makes me think and miss mine 💚 credit to you all.
Good on you mate!
Tammys never gonna be pissed again😂
Beautiful brother, well done!
Monumental my man. We're all appreciative of you're efforts and progress
This was amazing to watch ❤️
This is truly great! Congrats. Content is top notch, and you all are even better.
So awesome!
Hats off to you Garrett, this really warmed my heart! This video was truly a genuine moment between you and your folks that you can cherish forever! Keeping doing what you and the rest of the GG crew are doing, you all are touching more lives than you realize!
You guys inspired me to pick up my dusty clubs and start playing again. I've reached out to my old high school golf buddies to play and we've reconnected after years. Turns out, they watch Good Good as well. You guys have so much impact. Change the world 1 swing at a time. Keep it up boys!
Garrett, you are awesome... all of you are!
I’m crying dude. This is amazing. You’re amazing. This totally made my day watching this
Talk about PURE!
Damn that's great. I've been watching since pre-Bro Five. I like to think I contributed about $14 of that haha.  Well done.
I knew there was something special when I came across your video with Tig a couple years ago. Keep up the good work, you all make me want to play and practice more.
Good for to give back to your parents. As a parent we do things for our kids out of love and support.  Hopefully to help mold them in to responsible adults.  Your parents did a good job.
You're the man, Garrett!
Congratulations brotha this is absolutely amazing!
You are a good man and a class act Garrett. I always look for the latest drop everyday.  Still can’t wait to see a European/Good Good scramble someday.
What can I say I've given Garrett a hard time for being a cocky sob, but this brought me to tears! Very classy thing to do for those who supported him. Well done Garrett!
love you bro, so amazed how down to earth you are
264k views, and I guarantee not one dry eye. This is awesome, you’re a good dude Garrett.
Im 35 and still cant do this for my mom,  its a goal in life for me to be able to take care of her. Keep building the brand and next time it will be a million my guy!
This is so dope of you man. Keep it up!
Awesome video.  Stay humble, always have gratitude, and you guys will only get bigger.  Congrats.
❤❤ much respect, young man. I have followed you from the beginning and you have completely amazed me with your talent and love for the game but far more of the man you have become. My son (which is your age) thinks the world of you and is always asking me if I've watched your latest video. We appreciate your awesome videos and the humble way you present yourself. Thank you, the world needs more young people like you!
Truly I’m so thankful for you guys! Just by watching your videos on the main channel and the labs videos it’s helped my iron game and my wedge game! Now to work on my driver!
Awesome stuff! Good man!
You forgot when you sent your mom to deal with your issues with brody
Awesome moment!!! Congrats!
Well damn didn’t have to make me cry😂
Dude got me teared up too
Much love brotha
I was cutting onions and then cut the grass. I have allergies! I'm not crying!
Everything about this video is so special. Your authenticity is one of the biggest things I've always loved about you and your content - even just the little things you do to "pick up" another player in goodgood when they're having a bad round... you are so down to earth and such a genuinely kind soul and it couldn't be clearer than in this video. Much love brotha thanks for sharing this.
Respect.
Literal chills you and the good good crew are the only youtubers I watch, glad to know all the vids I watched and the money earned went to a good person with a good heart
This is the coolest shit Ive ever seen bro. Mad respect ❤️ this is what we all dream about. You’re one of the blessed people who actually got to do it. Love this so much
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I've been on this adventure with you guys for 4 years now. Watching videos everyday. Rewatching videos. Inspired me to play golf again. You young men are awsome and Garrett, ifk how the stars aligned for the future you are living in the now but you are here. Keep up the good work Garrett and Good Good. Easily the best golf channel on youtube period. Thanks for making me feel like a kid again!
Who's cutting onions 🥹
What a great moment... I truly felt the emotion and my eyes even watered up and I don't normally do that.  Congrats on your success and that you gave back and you truly understand what your parents did.  That is awesome and you will understand when you become a father.  Keep up the great work and I will still follow...
It’s ok k to cry bro!   I’m crying too!
I got a little choked up listening to this. It’s crazy when you think about all the sacrifices people make for their kids. Now that I have a 10 month old daughter I understand that type love. Great video man.
This is incredible! All the hard work pays off and it is truly worth it when you can accomplish things like this. Keep up the awesome work! Best video on YouTube right now!
holy shit u made me tear up crazy
Great job, wish I had been lucky or talented enough to do something similar?
Love the authenticity
Been following u since 2019 brotha proud of u G
Good shit G
Way to go Garrett. What an accomplishment to be able to do that, and such generosity. Your heart is in the right place!
Bro what the heck. Why am I crying
that was so cool!! the best part was at 5:21 when your dad said "what the heck son?!" so funny.
You're a King Garrett, so many people take for granted what they're parents do for them throughout their life. To give back and show with your emotions how much your parents mean to you is very heartwarming. Massive respect to you for that.
Tig needs a coffee sponsorship lol
That’s awesome, keep up the hard work
Dude you don’t need to thank the fans the fans should be thanking you. I for one thank you tremendously. What you just did was so badass. You’re the man!
Love this!!! Been awesome watching you grow since the beginning!!
gotta love parents!
Good for you, man! always feels good to give back, keep it up!!
Good job G
Amazing stuff I love your content but this is by far the best thing you’ve ever put out. Thank you for sharing this moment with your family
Amazing, Garrett!
mans lookin solid you bean hittin the gym there garret
Proud of you
Good things happen to Good Good people
Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, did not say “Paradise is under the feet of mothers.” Well done man
Positive vibes
jeez, been following you for a long long time now .. since before good good and early gm days. This was emotional for me too! Can't imagine how amazing this feeling was. Love you and your content G!
wow G, as a dad that only wants the best for his boys and wants nothing in return except for some success for them this was AWESOME.  You are truly blessed to have such parents, as they are to have child turn out like yourself 💙💯
Dude I love this!!! You have worked so hard, and deserve this more than anyone! I love that you did this for your parents, it shows you were raised right, and your parents poured into you! G, I know you probably will never see this, but I am so proud of you. Genuinely, you are amazing. You and your family are blessed, god bless all you guys!
Such a proud moment G 👏👏👏
Had me in floods...........You are such a great son and such a humble man. Your with a great bunch of guys. Wishing ye all much love and happiness for life.
This is incredible!!!
Hey yall 🙂 how yall doing? 💪💯🔥🔥 if anyone wants to do a collab I'm down to I'm not that good but I'm trying 😂 I appreciate yall reading this and hope you have a better day then before reading this much love y'all 💙💪💯🙏🔥💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Your parents are so so proud of you
"Honor thy father and mother". You have lived up to one of God's great commandments. You are so blessed Garrett!
I cant love this enough
You are a real good man a wise man once told me you can’t be a man till your a man of God first!
You’re the epitome of what we parents wish our kids can be when the grow up. I got a little emotional watching this and can say, although I don’t know you but am very proud of you. Your parents are blessed.
You’re a good egg, kid!
Face it you still owe them $350,000 for raising you.
Well done Garrett
I’ve been watching since it was just you matt and Steve, and to see how far you and the crew have come has been nothing short of incredible. I’ve always really admired how humble you are Garrett. Without you, none of Good Good exists. If someone were to watch 10 Good Good videos without any prior knowledge, they’d have no idea you’re the “leader” or one who started all of this. Because you don’t see it like that, or act above the rest in any way whatsoever. You’re an incredible friend, son, and role model.
We all appreciate you G being a positive influence on and off the course im happy to be able to see this and grateful of the impact you have made
This is so fricking cool man congrats
Ставлю лайк
Such a great video, congratulations on the achievement man, I’ve been watching your videos since you played before school love what your guys do and you are definitely a huge reason on why I play golf today so thank you for all the great videos to you and all of Good Good
Good Good and Garrett are class acts.   Great work Garrett.   Your parents are truly proud of who you’ve become.   ⭐️
So awesome. Can’t wait to see you at Dove Canyon again 🤙🏻
Good shit. Her expression ..hehehe
Unreal how far you’ve come brother. Very self made and devoted. This is really special stuff.
I would be lying if I said I didn’t get emotional when your mom opened the envelope. I would love to do something similar one day.   Well done G! 👏🏽
Geez, didn’t think I’d cry
❤
Maybe there is hope for the future when kids like this appreciate and understand what sacrifices are made for them. Having his gratitude towards his parents, even if they didn't deposit/cash the check, was way more important to the parents. Beyond words. This is everyone's "someday" moment.
Your a good dude Garret.
damn i almost cried!
This is so wholesome brings a big smile man happy for you Garrett
and they accepted it. wake up.
This is not the type of thing which should be made into a video.
Hey garret I just wanted to say thank you for making my life better. You were the person that truly got me into golf. I’m glad that I could be a part in all this.  You made golf look so interesting and fun. My golf game kinda started like yours. I remember the very first round of golf you played you made a hole in one. Then you fell in love with the game. That’s similar to how mine started except I don’t make a hole in one 😂. You and good good labs have really got my swing path better and helped improve my swing. Thanks for everything garret!
Garrett will do it?
Love this.
this is heartwarming, man. Can’t wait to do this for my parents one day
Wow. Great work. 👍
That’s awesome!!!! You are blessed to have them and be able to do this.
Great video, beautiful moment, thank you!
Well done Garrett, well done.  You honor your parents today in more ways than you probably realize.  Just by being the kind of man who wants to give back to your parents you demonstrate that their hard work has been worth it.   It also shows the kind of person that you are.  Leaving in the shots where you are emotional was a good decision.  Youtube and the world in general need to see good, healthy emotions, and good situations.  Thanks for bringing positivity in what you do.  I have dropped all TV because it is garbage.  Good Good, GM_Golf, your personal channels all have great content that is fun to watch and not like all of the junk that is invading media.  I truly appreciate what you do and wish you all the best!  God Bless you.
Garrett I'm so happy for you. I've watched you since 'Tammy's going to be pissed' thru bro 5 to today and everything between. You are what everyone aspires to be. In the words of the great Joe dirt, keep on keepin on. I wish you nothing but the best. You inspiration transcends generations, both young and old.
I wish I could hit the like button like a million times for this share.
Such deserving parents and great job garret for giving back to your best supporters!
First YouTube video that’s ever made me cry
I’m not crying you’re crying
You’re a good man
Good Job , very impressed, keep it going.
I would have done it in cash.
Huge respect for you. Very honorable! 👍👍
Tammy isn’t going to be pissed about this 😂 😂
That Sir, is the true definition of a son and a humble man.  Main reason I follow good good. Bunch of humble good dudes. Who drive the hell out of a ball!  Haha. Congrats!!
Made me cry bruh lol well done man, love how genuine you are and what a great family you all are 👌 x
❤️❤️
I love that she read the card before looking at what was in it
Damn. Who cutting onions in here?
Well done man we’ll done. ☘️🍀🇮🇪☘️🍀🇮🇪
Man you didn’t think you’d cry through the intro well I didn’t think I’d cry the whole video. That shit was coolest thing ever, and truly showed how much it means to you seeing how you acted. I love it man don’t stop
And this is why I’ve been rocking with you since the beginning. Such a solid, wholesome dude. So happy for you bro ✊🏽
give  to them https://youtu.be/UWBWmpBHIxE
🔥🔥🔥
Really awesome man
Why would anyone even flex that kinda shit?
Well... it's not my allergies, I'm crying.

Literally the biggest dub
This is it... this is real.... this is why we love y'all!   Great job bro!

Garret, weld done. Now thank God for being able to give your parents Money.
You are a good man Garrett. Not alot of kids grow up to be good men and think about their family like this. Love watching good good and all the members
Real day one
Thanks for sharing this beautiful moment with your folks. Very special
Good good all seem a great bunch of lads, if you come to the UK for this collaboration with Rick Shiels I’d love to watch live 😎
Very cool video. Way to go man.
Wow garret. I'm from south Africa and watch all your videos. What you did is amazing and you inspire me every day not just to be a better golfer but to be a better person and always remain positive. Much love man. Proud of you
U absolute legend! You couldn’t do it any better! Loving your parents and letting them know you do, is the most important thing in life. ⭐️
Get your dad out on the course
🙏👍💖👐👏
You got me tearing up while feeding my daughter… this is awesome! Way to go Garrett❤️
Amazing gift Garrett this is the moment if I ever made a lot of money, this is the first thing I would do. Give back to my parents cause they give up so much for us
This was beautiful G.

Well done Garrett!
The best video I have ever watched. I cried like a baby. What a beautiful thing to do, Garrett. I’m so glad I have followed your journey from the beginning. You are humble, grounded, and kind. ❤❤
Raw emotion it’s rare to see this kind of emotion through out social media your doing big things dude everything is deserved 👊🏻👊🏻
Garret you are a very special young man with a tremendous amount of talent. Well done you
love this
It's laying too because it's been doing this too he shoots himself in the foot in the first 10 seconds He's been doing this for so f****** long and because he sees that someone else did it he's going to do it but it looks like the students been sucking on his own thumb since the f****** age too and his parents $700,000 is like nothing to them So put some more blushing your cheeks you little chipmunk
Not impress ed unoriginal insincere and it's the same amount as before this kid is made so much more than that he can give his parents a lot more than that what a twerp
Amen! Amazing video congrats and this is your best video by far ❤️
Hope you let the IRS know
If ya think of all the years parents give to their children not jus money. It be a honor to give back to your parents!!
This is a dream of mine.  Just to even give my mom a small house to call her own.    This is inspiring  and you’re an amazing person for this.
Such a cool thing to do but you didn’t have to record this
Legend. Pure heart bud 💕
This was beautiful brought me to tears. Good job kid, Nothing makes a parent prouder then knowing their kids appreciate them. Love this
i don’t comment on a lot of stuff, but you sir deserve all the success and blessings to follow. it has always been of mine too to give back to my incredible parents. thank you for the inspiration and thank you and all of the good good guys to make my days a little better when i see an upload. congratulations man, keep being you 💜

We have all sinned against a Holy God and are criminals we deserve hell but 2000 years ago the father sent his son Jesus Christ he became the sacrifice for our sins he died a horrific and horrible death to keep you out of hell he suffered the horror of the cross to keep you out of hell if you will repent and trust in the saviour you will be saved he rose from the dead the third day conquering death and he is at the right hand of the father he offers you eternal life come and be saved today God will bless you and give you his holy spirit if you ask him 🙏🙏
This is so inspirational.. While I won’t ever be able to repay my parents with that amount of money, I plan to save up and purchase a nice vacation for them one day. Many people grow up and forget who actually got them to where they are. That is something I think about all the time and this video hit home for me as well. This was so awesome to watch!!
Congratulations. You work hard, you get to play hard.
So cool bro…. For reasons of my own I was even crying. Good people deserve good things.. good good things.
amazing Garrett!
Love it, Garrett.  Your parents raised you right.  You're a solid dude and this speaks volumes to your character.  Now if you'll excuse me I need to find my box of kleenex.
Awesome, Good for you dude!
My father who at 74 is still having to work to pay off a loan, that at the time if we had known what was going to happen a few months later, he wouldn't have... He still has about £8-10 thousand pounds to pay off... Breaks my heart I'm not in the position to pay it off so he can retire. :(
incredible, garrett! a beautiful moment you and your parents will cherish forever ❤
This is awesome man! Well deserved and you have come such a long way since I found your channel a few years ago.
ive been watching for years garret since under 50k subs and im proud to be a part of this journey. your a great dude i hope one day i get the chance to meet the boys in good good you seem like an amazing group of people. we here for the long run. 1M subs this year LETS GOO!!!!
Aw his dad's like " What the Heck son?!" while moms just crying. So sweet ❤
Dude...this was incredible to watch.  Giving back,  and for the right reasons.  You and the Good Good crew, are straight up, good people.  Very cool, man.
#24 trending right now look at ur impact G
I've been watching you since you were playing speed rounds at Sunflower in the cold before school, and when Scharff was playing the junior course with a pan.  It's been fun watching you guys evolve and grow.  Well deserved success young man, and not only to you, but to the rest of the crew.
You deserve it Garrett. You’re doing so much for the golf industry
God Bless you Garrett!!
Garrett this shows what outstanding character you have and the amazing job your parents did. The world is a better place with people like you out there.
Another example of white privilege at its finest
I’m proud of you Gar I look up to you brother❤️
bro you got me cryint
Hello. This is you local IRS agent.  Thank you for documenting this transaction. We’ll be expecting your check soon. 🤣
Well done young man, your parents couldn't be more proud of you, I wish you were my son .
Bro I almost started to cry thanks for a the videos that you and good good do it has rlly made me love the game
You are not getting chills you are getting BUFF!
Keep it up I know your parents are proud and could care less about the money.  Seeing their children turn into adult and finding what makes them happy is what it’s all about for parents.  I know I want the same for my two girls.
I'm not crying, you are..
Basically every kids dream
Love the emotion and how sincere this is
Bless you Garrett. I know parents are super proud, and you’re a great role model for a lot of hopeful young golfers. Congratulations!
Garrett having the ability to do that for your parents is a dream not many people can achieve . I've always thought that if was to win a lottery or came into loads of money how amazing it would be to change people's lives for the better. Congrats Garrett!!
Two thumbs way WAY up !  Garrett Clark.. you are just built a little different.  That is a reflection of great parents... Atta Boy!!!
Class act
Good stuff bro! Keep grinding
Good job man ... no flashy car is equivalent to the family of family
G! Congrats brother this video was awesome. I'm so very happy for the success that you've earned and the love that you've been able to spread because of it is awesome. Congrats again bro it's a beautiful thing to see.
Garrett - stay golden bro you got this figured out
Let's go G! Great work
That’s awesome Garrett!
Shows your true values and the real, true mission and vision statement of Good Good. Always stay true to these values and these means. Really shows class and character. Cheers
That was awesome.
Beautiful. Your parents did a wonderful job raising you such that your first professional goal was to repay them for all their sacrifices. This is what it's all about. Cheers, well done!
So cool man. Parents are the biggest blessing. Hope I can do something like this for mine one day
Where grown men cry
Well played Sir.
I am literally crying bro
Add me to the group that got choked up and teary eyed. To many people today just focus on themselves when the true reward is helping and giving back to others. To be able to do that for your parents is truly amazing!
Garrett Clark. You're a great dude, I'm so glad you can do this for your parents. I wanted to do so much for my father who raised 4 kids by himself. But he died before I had my own business. So proud of you
This is more proof that Garrett is one of the best dudes on the planet
This is amazing. Been following your journey and this is well earnt. You deserve all the success congratulations
My dreams coming true in my world, thank u  to each  child for 🌅🏖️🌦️🏜️🌋🔥☃️🌬️🌀🏔️ the 100 grand. Because of  YOU!🕸️🌍
I have to big of a beard to be crying like this in public. GOSH DAMN. Good for you bro. Proud of you
This is amazing. Thank u for sharing this moment and riding with you and the boys till the wheels fall off
Garrett you have restored my faith in the younger generation. You have a lifelong subscriber and I wish you many more successes
Admire your passion, G. And respect your sense of appreciation in giving back!
Thanks for getting us all choked up. Awesome stuff man.
wwwwwwwwww
inspirational............ thanks!
Congrats Garrett. Family is everything! ❤
Huge for the program
Congrats Brother! Family is your wealth
This is awesome!! Way to Garrett!
Love it man...no words. You are just a great person and an amazing son. Keep it up
They raised you right bud.
Simply can't beat this. Hats off to you, man. You're a great dude
can’t believe how far this has come so inspiring.
Awesome to see dude. Your dad was right by saying you've changed alot of lives. I mean let alone in just the game of golf (just watching you guys and the lessons you give have completely turned my golf game around 1,000%) but I feel like you guys live the right way. Not letting the popularity change the way you guys are. Still like a group of little kids hanging out with your best friends, and keeping things *mostly* clean. I love that you guys are still willing to share your faith at times and be completely open and honest to all of us. You guys are really some amazing role models to multiple generations of viewers. Appreciate all you do, keep it up 🤟🏼
This right here just shows what a product of great parenting does. G is such a great kid and becoming a better man. We need more people like this in the world and this gives me hope there’s more good than evil in the world. Love the GG crew keep up the great work!!
Good for you man!! I wish I could do the same for my Father. Great to see a young man with his head on straight. Keep up the great content
Beautiful family. They raised a awesome kid. I’m having a kid in September and I hope he’s half the son you are. I’ll let him know 50k is plenty LOL. But seriously beautiful man so happy you’re in the spot to do this you deserve it
wow I couldn't even hold myself together watching this, Your a great man.
I cried
good stuff
Nice
Hey garret I followed you guys from the day yous have all started, I think this would have to be the best video yous have ever put together love it .
You’re the man! Thanks for sharing this moment!!!
“Tammy’s gonna be pissed” … not anymore 😂
As someone who watched from the beginning and saw the growth of you and your group, this was really cool to see. Not too proud to say I teared up.
About time you paid Tammy back for denting her pan
May God Bless you. With the same measure you give it will be given to you.
Amen, just Amen!
Garrett you did something that made my day! I love the golf content but this was heartwarming brother! Made me tear up! Parents are everything and without them we would have nothing. Love you guys! Now get me to come golf with you :)
This is better than any golf video you could’ve made man. So happy for you to be able to do this. If this isn’t every sons goal to do for their parents idk what is
Remember when people did stuff like this without filming it for views?
SO INSTEAD OF JUST GIVING THEM MONEY YOU MADE A VIDEO ABOUT IT SO YOU CAN WRITE IT OFF AT THE END OF THE YEAR AN GET IT BACK😅 LIKE A OPRAH SHOW 😂
Awesome to see man! Congrats!
Love this.
Garrett and the whole good good group are like the nicest most amazing human beings on YouTube..
You guys are such good people I'm thankful to be apart of what your doing as a fan
Commenting for algo
So awesome Garrett! Your're one of the good (good) people on YouTube. Thanks for all of the great content- Congratulations on your success, well deserved.
Great story!  College isn't required to pursue your dreams.
You made me cry.....
Tammy not gonna be pissed !!
I'm not crying your crying 😢
We made the right guy famous bois
And this is why I will ALWAYS be a fan you and your journey. Been watching you since the beginning and since day 1 you've been the same good hearted person. Many blessings to you and your family!
What an emotional video Garrett, Tammy is definitely not going to be pissed.
Not going to lie... When he was sitting at the table... It had that "mom I got her pregnant" vibe
May have started crying along with you for a while there. Happy for you man, congratulations. And well done.
Amazing moment, G!
Who's cutting all the onions in here?!
I’m not crying you are
wholesome <3
Amazing man
“That’s gonna be good for like twenty years” lol what a gem!
This is awesome.  So happy for you and your whole family.  You and your Sister are both amazing people and your parents have a lot to be proud of.  Congrats G.
This is what its all about. Such an inspiration man
Gotta say…wasn’t your biggest fan, but seeing how much you care for and respect your parents has completely changed my opinion.  Amazing, amazing stuff man.
Wonderful... Really liked this vid!
This is truly what is all about, having the opportunity to give back and doing it is absolutely awsome.
Your dad was right at the end there. Thank you for all the positive energy you brought to us the last few years 🤙
Well deserved Garrett. You are very humble and inspiring.
That is a life altering amount of money.  Good for you Garrett.
you are a good man bud. damn near had me in tears watching this
Being a father myself, I can just say that parents just love to give/sacrifice for their kids - without expecting anything back. They are happy and satisfied when they see their kids do well in life. Your gesture is beautiful, but I don’t think that the money really matters to your parents. It’s your heart, who you are and relationship, that really matters to them.
I woke up to this. Thank you, Garrett!
Tremendous Garrett. 💙
Insane video and thing to do, congrats!
Who's cutting onions?
This is every kids wish.  To one day be able to do something like this for their parents.  Humbling to watch.  Thank you for sharing this moment with us!
This is what it's all about man. thank you for sharing this.
God dammit, Garrett.  You're literally the GOAT.  Good for you brother
Jesus loves you all and died for our sins
❤️
Garret you are a fantastic person! Never stop being you!
I have said from the very beginning that Garrett is the best Good Good Player! This confirms that he is not only a great golfer with a lot of natural talent- but he also has a huge heart!! This one made my cry.
ur the best investment they made
This is why you’re the GOAT Garrett. Started watching in the sunflower hills days and you’ve done nothing but go up from there congrats man.
Very awesome Garrett
Respect my man your built a lil different than most
Wholesome AF man. Congratulations! And I respect you recognizing where it all came from. We all dream of doing this exact thing for our parents who made who we are today.
I shouldn't be crying at work.
this is amazing!!!!!!.... good luck and all the best!!!!
One zero short… 😉💪
Only been watching good good for 2 weeks because I only just really got into golf but I’ve watched a lot of videos from all you guys and it’s amazing to see how far you’ve come and now doing this even though I was apart of it from the start I’m happy to be a part of it now
Tami’s gonna be PISSED!!!
Garret, you're making my 17th birdhouse in a row looking pretty bad right now! jk, loved the vid
Garrett, when a parent watches their child grow into a young man and become the person that you are, the overwhelming feeling of love for you and knowing that all of their hard work and sacrifice was worth it.  As a parent we just want our children to be happy, respectful to everyone and successful in their career. You are all of those and I can see the joy that you bring your parents. Keep up the great work!
Garrett you deserve everything coming to you brother. Hearing your dad talk and get choked up made me tear up a little…
This had me crying. I mean UGLY crying 😢
This is awesome man. Congrats on your success and way to show some love to the people who made it happen.
God I F’in love the good good guys
Dang man this had me in the feels
This is every sons dream man, to give back to the ones who gave you everything. Congratulations and well done, youre a great bloke!
Impossible not to like this... IMPOSSIBLE. ❤️
Tammy is not gonna be pissed
Love what you are all about Garrett, you are such a genuine dude. Keep it up
Amazing Garrett, well done what a fantastic gesture, had me close to 😢
Happy for ya. I'll never be able to do that for mine.  Glad someone can. You guys are doin great
Pretty cool and humble. So nice to see this from a YouTuber. I’m subscribed and liked the Vid. Let’s go boys…get this kids subscribers up. Share…and like.
Seeing Garret from the junior course to signing 100k check for his parents. Tearing up early this morning🥲
Congrats Garrett, been watching for a long time. Been awesome to watch you guys grow the channel over the last few years, cant wait to see how far you guys take this and grow the game. Thank you
You're a great man. You deserve everything.
Very cool Garrett!! Thanks for sharing.
Don't even have the words. Congrats G. Unforgettable moment.
A+
Forget holding it back, get in those feels man. This is a big deal and you are doing a great thing! love this!
Tammy's gonna be pissed
Well done Garrett, making it big is one thing but giving back to the ones that supported through everything is another!!! Keep making awesome content.
Happy for you man! Good too see people giving back to the most important people in their lives. 😎
Real life super hero right there
There is nothing to be shame about. Crying it's what make as humans way to go
I recently got a promotion and nearly doubled my pay. First thing I thought to do was an all expenses paid trip to machu pichu for my mom and her man. Not gonna lie, slightly triggers me I agreed to pay for him as well 😂, but I know him being there will make my mom happy. And she freaking deserves it. Seeing this video reassured me I’m not giving too much and no amount can repay our parents for what they have done for us :)
Respect to you guys. Some of the most down to earth people on YouTube. Stay true to yourselves brothas ! :)
Man it got really dusty in my house quick. For real though that’s amazing and thank YOU and all the GG crew for the incredible work you put out there.
I cried.
This is what it’s all about. Garrett, that was awesome.
Read the title, and made it to like 30 seconds in the video. Why make this a video? How Kardashian of you.
Proud of man. You all are awesome!
Garrett lookin swoll
Awesome, your mum's response just shows what a pure heart she has. Good man Garrett.
Garret this is special.. talking to you in 2017 and seeing you now is unreal. Completely surreal. So proud of you Bro 🙌
Boy if you stay this good at heart as you mature and get older you will be the model citizen everyone craves to be, well done and crying is just weakness leaving the body. You are a great kid.
Best video you've ever done. Love this dude. Family is everything and make sure you appreciate you mam and dad for as long as you have them. Lost my dad 3 years ago and miss him every day.
Didn’t plan on choking up on my ride to work. You guys are amazing people. Love to see it
Damn you really got me tearing up in my office like this Gmoney. Ah man. You can tell your parents raised you right and they are great parents too. Freaking beautiful!
Garrett is so humble that I think he forgets he is the one who started all of this. It's no coincidence his personal youtube channel was bigger than Good Good until recently lol. The guy works hard. 💪
It’s so nice seeing the right people be able to do this.
This is what happens when you raise a good child. Bless you Garrett.
G-RAT, YOU GUYS ARE VERY INSPIRING, UPLIFTING SPIRITS
Let’s goooo
You're a good dude, Garrett
Why does this have to be filmed? Load of bs
Good job G, think just about all of us can relate to this one, but few get to actually do it.
I’m not crying your crying 😢
Love this
Such an incredibly heart warming experience. Congratulations Garrett! You’ve got a heart of gold man. God Bless you!
You're an awesome dude, Garrett Clark. Ive watched Good Good for a while now. The whole Good Good crew are always a joy to watch! Much Love!
u know ur dad was wright u have changed alot of people i watch all of yalls content and i love it hell i even mad a chip in the other day first time ever and i alomost made a hole in one on par 3 i dont take lessons i just watch yall keep up the awesome content
Very inspiring Garrett 👌🏻 I’m sure your parents are very proud of you! Keep grinding and go and buy yourself a lambo 😂
so awesome hell i started to get teared up lol
Awesome awesome awesome
Go on bro
Ledge mate want to see u in a video playing ur dad can he play ?
Your guys enjoyment from making videos really comes through and the genuine nature of all of you. I have only started to play golf over the last year but after seeing and random club challenge with you and bubbie I was hooked, you guys have not only helped my game but helped grow my love of golf and I thank you for that. Keep up the good work man
Good on ya mate. I just recently lost my Dad on his 80th birthday. I've been a private military contractor for years after leaving Australian SF and your awesome and genuine gift to your parents made me deicide to sign over all of my earnings to Mum. I'd put them through enough and I can always earn more but the love of a Mother and Father is priceless. You have my admiration.
Dude... so awesome
Very cool
You have a life time viewer in me. You have always struck me as a good young man. Not for giving your parents the money. It's because you seem to be just yourself. Good luck in your future and God bless. Keep it up.
Jesus Christ, I’m a fully grown man sobbing in my van whilst watching this 😂 amazing thing to do and congratulations for everything you’ve achieved Garrett 🏌🏼
This is something I aspire to do myself so seeing this really inspired me to keep going. A true inspiration and it couldn’t be for a better person and family. All love, congratulations.
Legend video buddy, really beautiful
Im crying too… <3
Hey Garrett! I know how you feel! You are the best!
You and all the GoodGood Team are a massive inspiration. It just shows that you GoodGood lads are real. If I ever had that opportunity, I'd breakdown and be speechless too. Just for this humbling experience I'm going to buy some more apparel to help you all grow your brand and show your amazing positive message out there. Much love to you Garrett. You are showing the world you're more than just trickshots and wedge game, you are a whole hearted man who will go above and beyond for your family, friends and viewers. Stay safe, be positive and always be GOODGOOD.
Started following y'all for the past couple of years now, and this moment made me stop and appreciate the essence of what you and your friends have done for the game.  Thank you for being humble, fun and entertaining to watch.  Your parents and those of us who follow you are proud of the kind young man you've shaped up to be.  Keep up the "good" work, on and of the course!
This is what it’s all about Garrett. You are more deserving of your fame and wealth than 90% of people out there. So much respect for you all for staying on that grind with the vision of doing something like this being your goal. Like everyone else is saying that’s a great man and many more great things will come to you and the rest of good good. You guys are winning at life so hard right now and I’m sure that’s enough of a gift for any parent seeing their kid be a complete animal and take over the golf scene on social media. There’s no one even close to you and the rest of good good and you guys really are an inspiration to people every single day. Much love to all the boys I hope I get the blessing to meet y’all one day, and hopefully I’ll have one of my uncles Cubans for Bubbie! You got some great parents and friends Garrett, but this win is all you man. As long as your out there slingin em down the fairway, we will all be watching🤟
People are asking me why I am crying in the office...
Such a good dude.
Brings tears to a grown mans eyes!
Your parents built you a putting green because you wanted one?!?!? I can just imagine me asking my dad for a green so I can make YouTube videos lmao!!!
This is so awesome! Congrats Garrett! You had me tearing up as well.
I love this man
Hope one day the whole good good team can come to Australia and play some courses here! You guys have made me wanna take up golf again and improve my game!
So this so farkn awesome well-done dood so like when are u going to go out with Claire and do stuff like that for her.mums and dads do so much without ever wanting ever wanting anything back very cool thing to do.

Nothing more satisfying then smashing a big goal in life...well done Garrett.  You guys really need to be holding good good golf events. They would sell out.

Tammys gonna be pissed😲
Awesome video man! The love and respect for your parents is a breath of fresh air, we need more of this in society. At the end of the day family is all we have. Respect my brother! I hope and pray the Lord continues to bless your life, and gives you more opportunities to be that light in this world!
I've been watching it all from the beginning of gm golf. You guys all saved my life. Thank you. The nights where I couldn't sleep I stayed up watching all of everyone's videos. Without you all I wouldn't be here. Im glad that simply watching something that we enjoy is able to allow you to bless your family's life. Your emotion shows just how much you care about what you do and the gratitude you feel towards your fans. We all love you guys like family. Good good and gm golf is the best.
Everyone sitting quiet crying for a sec is great!!!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

Man, that was one of the most beautiful moments I have ever witnessed. Hope I can do that for my parents some day. God bless you Garret, and your parents.
What a surreal moment that must’ve been for you! Brought all us viewers to tears no doubt. Love to see you giving back. Good Good is the best channel on YouTube no doubt. Love all your work, keep grinding until you can turn that into a mili!
That was so awesome and Emotional at the same time👍👍👍
been following u since 2018, this is my favorite video......
This is the best bud thank you. Keep doing what you doing bud!

Proud of you man!
🤍🏌🏽
We love you g good stuff man love to see it🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
🐐 for this
Incredible moment G!
You are a great person. 💙
I get emotional watching this. It’s hard to watch this in full. But I’m planning something very similar. I’m hoping to get a similar reaction.
W
I would guess your parents get more satisfaction from seeing you do what you love than from any amount of money.  The first time I wrote a 6 figure check it took me six tries to get it right!
Nobody on this app that I’d rather support. Across all types of content. I’m glad to have been a part of it from early on. Proud of you man
Inspiring bro
Amazing vid. Congrats G
What a man. Absolute legend.
Garrett... this was incredible! You are an amazing person. I've been following you since day one. I am so proud of seeing the man you have become. You had me crying right along with you the whole time. Love you and everything you do!
❤️
Thanks kids crying.
Amazing Garrett, as always the Good Good guys continue to surprise us with how genuine, generous, and down to earth they are. What an amazing moment to share with your family. Wish you all continued success. God is good.
You got some ugly writing though
@garret! (Saw the first 2 mins of vid)You don’t need to explain! We love you man! Collin we love you too
Watched u grow from a kid to a man . Congratulations my dude you have very good people around u that legitimately had your back from day 1. That is VERY RARE nowadays, cherish it I lnow u don't take anything for granted. God Bless 🙏 ⛳️
This was an awesome video man. On another note it’s cool seeing how many checkmark accounts comment now. I’ve been here since before the blow up.
Genuine group of guys, what an amazing accomplishment!
I just cried my eyes out sheesh
Who was cutting onions? 😭 great video Garrett this is what it’s all about!!
Been watching you for awhile. Such an inspiration and your parents are very lucky to have you. Keep up the good work. Y’all are great people
If there was a live button for this video, I would've hit it right away.  More of the human side of you. Just amazing .  :)
Well Garrett you brought this 41 year old to tears
the title... why didnt grant get 100k?
May God continue to bless you and your family Garrett! Never stop being the humble guy that got you where you are today.
You the man G! Your parents raised a fine young man!
You guys deserve all the blessings coming your way
The best video you've ever made Garret...Thank you for sharing this with us!
Absolutely love it. As kids this is what we strive for. To pay back the loved ones who got us to where we are!
My parents are my number 1 supporters, this hit home with me hard bro... You're a great human Garrett.. inspiring!!
This kid is the man. Find me a better all-around person than the G-rat. I’ll wait!
i need to make sure my parents don't see this clip :P
Mad respect. Love the raw emotion. You're a good dude. Stay true!
he looks like mom
Such a great video my man congrats! Side note: how does Micah always have a cup of coffee somehow😂
FYI, it’s not just kids that watch your channels… I’m 47 and I watch all of y’all’s videos every day.
You are a grounded young man Garrett! I enjoy watching you grow your career.
With the you tube algarythm how ever you spell it regardless there is nothing more than I would like to play a game with you and Grant. The both of you have such good souls… thank y’all. You take me to a better place. 33yrs young here. Thank y’all!
This is what it's all about. Good on you Garrett, a moment you and your folks will cherish for the rest of your lives!
I never cared for Good Good. And thought they were all douches. Until I started watching Micah and Grant’s personal channels. Then finally started to come around to watch the main channel. I’m glad I subscribed
This was amazing. One day I'd like to come play a round with you guys
Amazing
This is amazing man! Would hope one day to give my parents 10% of what you were able to give! Just amazing!
Kudos to you Garrett!! Keep up the good good work!!
Great job Garrett glad you took care of your parents
Are the sleeves on that blue shirt suppose to be that long??
This was the best video I’ve ever seen out of you. Hit me and everyone else in the heart.
This has made watching you for 6 years worth it. Way to go G! <3
Thank you for sharing this awesome moment with us.
That is such a great surprise for your parents Garret!!!  A very heart warming payback to your parents. 😊
imagine if you gave it to someone thats acctualy in need
Been watching you since 10k on GM Golf. Watching your buildup to this point has been unbelievable. Congrats man
Real one. That made me 🥹
Awesome stuff G! My wife and I finally were financially stable enough to take my parents to Hawaii a few years ago and I remember giving them that gift and it was very similar feels to this video! Happy you could do that for your parents!
Literally stood up and clapped in my living room when you handed that cheque over to your parents. Superb young man. It's become even more of a pleasure to meet you knowing that you've done this for your family
Good on you Garrett. If you have kids one day you will realize that check could have been $10 or $1,000,000 your parents just love seeing their son secure in life and happy. There’s no price on that. Keep it up!
This is just another reason I love this channel... We love it when our children do well, and remember to take time to thank their parents.. Nice going Garrett..
Let the emotions out my guy, nothing wrong with it. You have been blessed by your parents and now get to bless them financially. Keep grinding and know you have all of our support.
lets go bro you deserve it been crazy watching the journey you made golf relatable
Garrett is UNSTOPPABLE
good for you brutha. well done!
So what's this kid trying to prove? That he's rich and can throw the cash around ?
This is awesome Garret, I can only dream of being able to do something like this for my parents. You’re an inspiration for sure. Proud of how far you and the boys have made it!
Respect bro.
I reached out and Garrett‘s dad blew our minds by putting Garrett and my nine-year-old son in touch on Christmas Day 2 years ago. They facetimed for two or three minutes.  My son showed him the golf stuff he got for Christmas : ). I was able to snap a screenshot and it’s been framed in his room ever since.  Thanks again for that special gift.  What a cool family.
Been following you guys for a while now I’ve always enjoyed all of the content but I’ve never been so inspired by one of your videos. Such an awesome thing to do. I hope someday I can do something like this and point back to this video like you did with MrBeast’s! Keep killing it G
Some how got recommended to this video and shed some tears. Incredible moment and definitely going to subscribe
Somebody was cutting onions when I was watching this, right in the feels. Congrats man this is awesome
That's probably the most generous and thoughtful video I've seen all year, not only did you succeed in your goal but you let everyone else share it as well. Thank you for that
This is the best thing I've seen on the internet in a long long time!! I'll always support all the channels. Good vibes, great people.
Let's go!
Beautiful moment! Glad you could do that for your parents. What an amazing thing to see and your dads right you and all the others of good good have changed a lot of lives! Thanks for everything y’all do
So admirable for this Garrett. You have such a humble heart and have been greatly blessed for it!
U r a good kid Grat!!
God bless you Garrett and all of goof good. It’s not just young people who enjoy your contribution and content I’m 49 years old and I honestly feel like I know all of you. I watch every single video and this is one of my favorites of all time. Thank you. Thank all of you.
This was wonderful your a good dude and a great kid I started playing golf because of good good all the guys are great I thought golf was stupid until yall made me realize it could be fun you and the boys inspire me and I enjoy all you do keep up the good work keep making the people you love and love you proud
Honestly, I can’t even put into words this group of people. I’ve been subbed to GM golf for a looong time. Watching all these videos is so inspiring and just heartwarming. Genuinely love these boys ✊🏼
This is dope!
you are the man, Garrett... this has been/is my #1 goal in life, and it was a pleasure watching you reward your parents for their dedication. Also, this is why you are the best YouTuber.... no bull shit. just sick golf shots and a real ass dude. all respect in the world.
Tammy was straight out of the straw bag here today
Hope I can do the same one day. Good work garret
I'm not crying, you're crying. That's absolutely amazing man! I think everyone that was raised right dreams of doing this and I'm so happy for you man!
Had my eyes watering ngl
Such a great video. Loved it
This is awesome, good man Garrett. Much love.
Just beautiful mad respect✊ Your parents have raised an awesome young man that realize what’s important in life.. Family❤️‍🩹
Made me cry bro. Been watching your videos for years! Always hoping I’ll run into you guys on a course here in KC. So far hasn’t happened, but hopefully soon! Love y’all’s videos, congrats and keep up the good work!
Your parents must be very proud!
i gave my parents a headache.
Well damnin garret Clark. I'm 31 years old, and this shit made me tear up,  wish I could do this for my parents,  amazing gesture,  you're a great person,  the things you said about your mom and your dad paying for everything golf related,  and taking you to tournaments. Really hit home for me, my parents supported me every step of the way when I played baseball, amazing parents, good job Garrett,  congrats on everything buddy,  cheers from Las vegas
Absolutely beautiful!
Super cool! I think this is what every son (and daughter) aspires to do for their parents some day.
Awesome thing, god bless y’all and y’all’s families..
This is the most inspirational video I've seen this year especially during the time of Covid and the world's going a bit crazy at the moment. Thank you G for bring forth this unbelievable experience! You have such a huge and wonderful impact on us viewers!
I love this for you bro been here since the beginning
Beautiful thing man. I have the same dream and will get there some day
What a great young man they have raised. I hope my kids grow up as humble as the good good gang. Love your videos and this just supports why. Well done!
Kudos to you Garrett and your parents! Great heart & humble dude! Wishing nothing but success to you and the Good Good crew!
Hey Garrett, my name is Anthony.  Been watching you since the chipping green in the back yard.  What a moment and what a gift for your parents.  Thx for all the videos and thx for letting us be apart of this moment.  Been watching you for years now brother:)  P.S. if you want to take on a challenge come to New Richmond WI.  We got a great course. P.P.S. love Garrett Clark Vlogs, love GM Golf, love Good Good, and everybody else.  Great video Garrett:)
Awsome!! Love it!! 👍👍
You’re a cool ahh dude Garrett
The love you have for your parents and they have for you is as genuine as it gets! Great video, great gift. This is what I strive for with my kids. Thanks for putting this out there for anyone to see. One of my favorite videos I've ever seen on YouTube. Hats off to you young man!
Parents look well off alredi tho 💀😂
"You guys have changed a lot of lives" truer words have never been spoken!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
That’s a blessing. What a great gift.
This was my dream ! Coming from poverty ! I've done ok but haven't been able to achieve this level of success, but this video was amazing thanks for sharing !!!
I don’t comment on videos. Ever. But I felt like this was a great video to leave my first comment on. Like your Dad said, God has blessed you and I truly hope that you believe that. I have been blessed enough to make a career out of doing what I love but it absolutely didn’t happen under my own power alone. You and the Good Good guys make great videos that I can watch with anyone and not be embarrassed by language or any of the content. I appreciate that and you guys are all the more respected because of that. At least in my book. Keep up the great work and it’s so great to see you be a blessing to your parents after they helped you along your path. I don’t have a great relationship with my family anymore and it made me think about a lot of things. Also, I live in Texas now and have started golfing more after watching your videos so I am hopeful that I will run into you at some point! Congrats on being blessed enough to be a blessing to others and I wish you the best of luck in the things to come in your career. Thank you for sharing this great moment and God Bless.
You’ve earned my respect forever garret. Not just for the act but what you said before as well. Made me tear up as well.
Good for you bro
This is an AMAZING testimony. The chills are from the holy spirit. Keep doing good-good work. May God continue to bless you, all of Good-Good and your families.  You brought this 44 year old some much needed happy tears. p.s. We need a hole in one from you soon! How did Matt of people get two and not you!! ;)
Garrett’s a walking W
Damn when i saw the thumbnail i thought it was cus u got grant pregnant but this is even better man. Congrats
I’ve lost both my parents in the year, but one of the things I’m thankful for is that they knew that I have a good life. Parents always worry for their children, but when they know you are in a good place, it’s a big relief. That gift alone is priceless and I know Garrett’s parents are proud, as they should be.
I cried dude. You are amazing. Good on you. Is that grammatically correct? My eyes are blurry
Stand up guy
That is tremendous
Congrats man. It’s great you’re able to do this and even better that you’re willing to recognize your parent’s sacrifices.
Hey Garrett, I debated whether I would even comment this or not but I have to let you know this video brought me through a lot of emotions all the way from tears of pain to smiling with joy.   I lost my dad to a sudden heart attack two weeks ago; he was 51. It has crushed my world because he was the same supportive father that you were explaining about your dad. That made me miss him so much. He was even my golf buddy everytime I wanted to go out, I’d ask him to go with me.    But it also gave me joy to know that there are others who still get to experience a relationship with their own loving and supportive father so I just wanted to encourage you that yes, what you did monetarily was amazing. But more importantly, once time passes, please continue to be there to love on your parents and continue to express your gratitude to them for everything they have done for you and they way they have loved you. Because I would give the world to tell me dad those things one last time.   Him and I used to watch your videos together and even he got a kick out of them and enjoyed. Stay grounded man! Thanks for posting this.
So glad I have gotten to follow along long enough to see this. I knew GM was gonna take off when I was watching the random junior course videos. Proud of you G.
I don’t really get emotional during these type of videos, but this one I did shed a few tears. Garrett and all the other Good Good guys are all so humble. Keep killin it!
that is so bloody awesome
Dude you have the nicest heart, and you have single-handedly changed so many lives. What a genuine block
Wow, you go G! This is every kids dream and you have done it 🙏🏼🙌
As the father of a 38 and 28 year old, I know how your parents feel. Sometimes, just telling them how much you love them a d appreciate them is worth all the money in the world! 100k is good good for the program!
This was very cool.
I'm crying. This is the sweetest video ever 🥺  Love all of your content Garrett  it's so good good 😅💕
This is what it’s all about. Seriously couldn’t ask for a better person to represent the game of golf.  Congrats on everything❤️
You’re such an inspiration, keep it up
So awesome! Out of everyone I watch this is the best! Love that you can give back to your family Garret! Shows they did right by you!
Great video G...it’s apparent you are not chasing clout with this video, just sharing the moment....you should be proud of yourself because I know your parents are proud of you...
very genuine you are an absolute legend
Way to go Garrett, you have made golfers all over proud, especially us oldtimers!  Been watching GM since the days of the short course, Steven hacking with Matt and yourself along with guest hosts like Zac Radford and George Bryan my other favorites.  It is nice to see a class act like yourself living your dream and not forgetting who raised you to be the leader of the pack of Good Good, a great person and even a role model young people can look up to.  Happy Mom's and Dad's Day to the Clarks, and kudos to a job well done.  Blessings to all Garrett's crew from Richard in Cosby, east Tennessee.  POSITIVE VIBRATIONS!!
I was crying with y’all. This is one of those things that reminds you that there’s good in the world and restores faith in humanity. Thanks for your contribution to golf, you’ve inspired me to start playing and it’s a big part of my life now. You do more than you know!
Here for this bro!! ❤️❤️🙏
Love to see the humbleness, humility, and genuineness you bring to all you do. Your dad said it best saying that you don't do it for the money, and God has rewarded you. Congrats man!   Also, love to see Micah with a nice cup of coffee!
Keep making great content Garrett!
Tammy will not be pissed
I’m wildly impressed w Garrett’s thoughtfulness, maturity, gratitude, and intelligence.  Wtg bro 😎
Congrats man. Been watching you for a few years now. Amazing how far all you guys have come.
This beats any hole in one video imo... stand up guy
Much respect G.  Much more gratification than a Lambo…
Micah has a coffee as usual
I love all the good good members it’s a dream to have a successful business /YouTube channel with your best friends. I swear I had a dream that I was a good good member. Sounds weird but it was the best dream I’ve ever had lmfaoooo hahaha Micah drinking coffee of course.
For those of you that haven't been paying attention, a huge amount of successful Youtubers are clean, honest, decent people brought up by wonderful parents and have been taught the will of God. Laugh if you want but it's true. Way over half of those I follow, by choice of content, NOT because of their beliefs, are like Garret. Most, if not all of Good Good, Cleetus and most of his gang, Steve Morris, Heavy D, lots of racers and lots of lawn care posters are all deeply invested in family and friends and have a commitment to living a good life under the rules of decency and respect. Something to work towards.
Well done Head Maniac!
Yooo this video is truly inspirational! Keep it up one milestone at a time
man this made me cry you could see the happiness and gratitude in his eyes and tone of his voice. Truly shows that these guys put in the time and effort and still prove to be the better people we need in this world!
respect man just straight respect ✊
👏🏻
Good things happen to good people that raise good kids
You’re a good man G. That’s good stuff right there
Love you Garret, love the passion and your parents and all of us are super proud of you.
This is freaking awesome, heart of gold man that goes a long way in life!
You are an inspiration to so many Garrett! Very glad to have stumbled across your page 5 years ago. Keep it up man. ❤️👍🏼
geez, im a 34 year old married man with a kid and this video even made me well up! what an incredible gift.
Tig never fails to have coffee in his hand
What a guy. Love to see you giving back to the ones who gave everything they had for you! Keep it up brotha!
Cpme along way well done man

Good job 👏🏾
Goat
That one hit me right in the feels!!!🙂
Love it! Great vibes! Great role model!
The parents go and buy a Lamborghini.
As someone that watches most of your content I have to same I'm glad they invested in you early. You (and the rest of Good Good) bring a lot of joy to a lot of people.
Good stuff🔥🔥
Isn’t it amazing how you can do something amazing for your parents. And the government still wants a bunch of it. It money that’s already been taxed.
100% deserved success brother! Much love ❤️
Amazing guy. 7 years ago I started paying off my parents farm. Best feeling in the world.
Been watching you since the beginning and this made tear up brother it’s so nice seeing a genuine person come out of this YouTube world where it can easily go the other way, congratulations!
Damn my allergies are acting up
I'm 40 and never cried watching a video, until now. That was legit honorable.
🔥{Matthew 23:5} KJV  But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments   🔥{Matthew 6:2-4} KJV  2   Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.   3   But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:  4   That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
Dang allergies man
Tami isn’t pissed. And the money came right out of the straw bag.
GG
Garrett, it’s amazing that you were able to do this for your fam, keep up the good work dude💯✊
“Just being you is a gift enough for us” hit home. Man your mom couldn’t have said it better. I’ll ride with you and GG boys till the wheels fall off man 🥲
That’s awesome man been here from the beginning
One of the best videos I've ever watched. Very moving.
Even though I’ve never met you…. I’m beyond proud of you and relate to you. So glad you could finally see this dream come true. You have a big heart and your parents love you like mine do. God bless you and your family 🖤
Love everything about this
W Garrett
Changed so many lives. Keep being you goat 🤝🏽
Dude, so much respect for you and your grind. Don’t ever stop
You’re a great young man you should be proud!
Congratulations on being able to do this for your family, they did a great job raising you. Good good has the most wholesome group of guys. Each and every one of y’all deserve the world.
Such a genuine guy.
I'm just glad the money never changed you and u remember where u came from, much love for that and being humble with the position ur in and not letting the money forget who u are.
This is all you could ask for.
This was awesome. You can see how much love your parents have for you and how that has influenced you. Thanks for sharing this!
Man you got me crying too
They raised a great son!
Tammy’s not gonna be pissed and she’s not gonna be outa the strawbag
You’re the man Garrett
You are a beautiful human being. And I can only hope that one day I can do the same for my family. Thank you for all of your hard work and content. And hope but nothing hide the best for you and your family.
So awesome Garrett! This is a dream I feel many of us want to accomplish at some point in our lives. It’s got to be an amazing feeling and at such a young age. You should be proud of yourself. Keep it up man more blessing coming🙏🏼
Congrats to the Clacks.  You raised a great son in Garrett & wonderful to see him growing up & being successful in his dream.  Great parents make better kids.  The support & help is what makes a better generation of people.  I hope we all will appreciate our parents more.
This was a tear jerker man. You doing this for your parents is so damn awesome!
Amazing truly amazing!!!!!!♥️
Mom was like no honey. Dad was like hell yeah😂
what an absolute legend
Great to see you value family over money Garret.  A great inspiration for a younger audience watching this channel.  I think everyone watching this is immensely proud of you and can learn alot from the example you have set.  Cheers to you and all of Good Good, I think the lot of you deserve that PGA bonus money more than anyone because NOONE is growing the game for viewers like Good Good.
Man what a moment, every kid dreams of, proud of you and all the guys. Huge for the golf community and social media. Wild to look up to someone younger than me but it’s truly inspiring. Congratulations Garrett
This is the most endearingly special content to watch!!! Thank you G! ❤️❤️❤️
i'm not crying... you're crying...
Thats awsome
sweet boy!
You are a great young man, and I’m sure your parents are very proud of you👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 WELL DONE ✝️
Tammy can get a new pan now!!! She is no longer pissed!
Tammy has secured the straw bag.
A class act. Thank you for honoring your parents. God is in the mix no doubt. I cried.  Seeing you love on your parents like that is awesome.
You are an amazing young man, Garrett. Your parents did a great job!  What you did was wonderfully selfless. It is awesome when we let God's love shine through us! ❤🙏
Wow!  Love this video!
AMAZING!!
Such a goat bro
Respect!
this is the way <3
Thank you Garrett for a great video. Really needed something uplifting today. Keep doing you do and only great things will come
That was awesome
Great family, great kid! Congrats man.
That's what good good is all about!!
Garrett’s a solid dude!
Big congrats Garrett, the ultimate goal
I'll take 5K for the support from the beginning.   Through Tig, Matt being crazy,  Stephen being wired and Grant intense..?.. even BroFive..
Raw, man.  Respect 🫡
the most wholesome video I've seen in a while. Jerry said it best - God has blessed you. And it's awesome to see you bless your parents in return.
This is awesome! Glad to be part of your journey! Keep grinding G ! ⛳️🏌️‍♂️
What a great feeling this must of been.  Awesome job Garrett...we all were in tears.
Good dude!
Good hearted group. Keep up the great content everyone.
Garrett has the biggest heart! You give way more than just great golf content
Good stuff G!
“You’ve never done this for money”… wow that shows how amazing your family is and yourself and just everybody in good good overall. Thanks for this video Garrett, you’ve done more us than we have for you.
Tammy is out of the straw bag
Good Man GRat!
Beautiful. I am not sure they are gonna cash that though lol.
Garrett, you are such a humble and down to earth person, good good on you, and all your golf buddies. Your parents are proud of you and have raised you well! Happy to part of the ride.
Awesome!! I love this
Wish I could give this a 100,000 likes
Where did these onions come from?
Garret, been watching you since Tammy got out of the straw bag, and I always knew you were a real one. Such a heartfelt video and I couldn’t be happier for you, your family, and the good good crew 💯 much love
God man who’s cutting onions in here huh????
Simply Amazing! Hands down the best video I’ve seen in a long, LONG time! God bless. Thanks for sharing this moment!
Garrett you are the best. You guys provided tons of content during a really rough time for a lot of us during covid. Watching your videos always makes my day better.
This is one of the many reasons I subscribed and like all of Good Goods videos. Keep doing what you’re doing.
Mad respect for making this vid G Money Rat Fart 💪  I don't watch you as much as I used to, but I will always love the content. Keep up the great work man, you're a real one
Living the dream my man! Congratulations on all your success!
Keep killing it Garrett! Looking forward to meeting you when we actually get a chance to do the 2v2 with Grant. You’ve inspired me to chase my dreams at 34! So don’t for one minute think your affect is only on kids, cuz it’s on all age groups.
Damn 😭
Made me text my parents I love them. Thanks Garrett. We need to appreciate our parents more. 250k just to raise a kid… like we truly don’t know the sacrifices they make. It’s only right we give it right back to them
Love you Garret. Impacting the world and your parents. What happens when you put in the work and God rewards you.
Garret, this is awesome, but please break this up over 2 years so you don’t go over the gift tax exclusion.
You weren't the only one to shed a tear.....So FER REAL.
Great video Garrett!   This one got me in the feels!   You’ve got great parents!
Happy for you Garrett!
Nice job young man.  Taught us all a lesson about giving versus receiving.  You should never forget this moment and know the two who are responsible for all the good inside you.  With a role model like you and your parents, your children will no doubt, learn what you have learned.
Just awesome man👊👊
Probably one of my favorite videos ever from you. This is what this platform is all about! Loved every second of this video!
You are absolutely amazing Garrett, you are such a big role model to young kids who want to do what you do and want to help other out !!!
Man….who’s cutting onions……seriously mad love and respect to you Garrett to giving back to your parents is how all kids should be, I wouldn’t be the man I am today if it weren’t for mine! Your going to continue to go places beyond your wildest dreams with the head you have on your shoulders and clearly a heart of gold! Keep it up man! I started golfing about 2.5 years ago still shooting over 100 but you and the goodgood crew have taught me so much and continue to make me wanna practice as much as possible to be the best golfer I can be been following all you guys for about a year now and you all are truly inspiring MUCH LOVE!!!!
Bro, I literally started crying towards the beginning of the video, and I know I'm not alone. Like your pops said, you've never done any of this for the money. You've changed so many lives because of loving and genuine dude you've been, and created one of the fastest growing golf brands in the world.  Super stoked you, big homie! Just the beginning!
Damn dude emotions hit G-Rat like a Mack truck. We all can relate to you in that way G-Rat. Beautiful video
you're a good man Garrett, love to see it
Bro, I haven't cried watching a YT video in a LONG time. You got me, man. Beautiful soul!
Who’s cutting onions
Your a good man! Love your channels
🙏🙏🙏
Respect!
This is why we watch your videos, one of the most humble, hard-working, genuine, kind, and caring people in the community right now. Truly an inspiration and something to hold your head high for. Not only are your parents proud, but we are to, love ya G ❤️
I think one of the reasons why you have so many fans is because of stuff like this, you aren't doing it for the fame, money or girls. You're doing it because you love golf and you pursued what you were passionate about and you're giving back to your parents who supported you through everything. Good for you Garrett, and good on your parents for raising a good kid.
I’m not crying your crying
Congrats man! Super inspiring
You’re the man G 🏆💪
Incredible stuff, great job!
Garret I can’t lie I been crying all day with sad tik toks and this shooting stuff going on plus this I couldn’t even watch the whole thing I’m balling my man you’re living the dream bro everybody wishes to do this for there parents one day and being the humble guy you are just playing golf with your bros with no fancy shit is why so many people love good good and your channel man! Props to you bro I hope I can do this one day for my parents! 💕 you’re a legend!
This is probably my favorite video you've ever done. Big congrats
What a guy!  Staying humble through all the success really shows what a good job your mom and dad did raising you!  Congrats man.
Great job Garrett, you and all the good good guys are amazing.
you are the man!
I cry like twice a year and this video brought me to tears. Gongrats Garrett, it’s insane how far you have came.
TAMMY IS GOING TO BE... proud of the young man her son came out to be
Cheez it grooves coated in tears. My favorite snack
You are an incredible young man Garrett.   Changing lives every day.  And killing it on the course. 🤘🏼
So cool man that’s a goal of mine aswell
Glad to have watched you all these years and to do this is such an amazing moment happy for you my boy!
I’m gonna say it. YA LOVE TO SEE IT, FOLKS! ❤❤❤
Love this!! So glad you could do this for your parents- what a huge day! And yes, I would imagine it’s normal to be excited to give a gift like that.
Dude I'm not even gunna lie I've seen you guys for the last couple years here and there and haven't paid much attention to yall. I wrongfully assumed you all were a group of those stuck up preppy golfers we all knew in high school. Man do I feel like I need to apologize right about now. After binge watching a lot of your content the last few months and gotten to know yall, you guys are some of the most down to earth, good human beings I've watched on youtube. This video and Bubbe on his addiction early on in life have both brought me to tears in back to back days. Garrett, man you are a G, this was super awesome to see. Being able to do something like this, for my parents has always been a dream of mine. God bless you and the GG crew.
Happy for y’all man I’m glad you’ve made it enough to be able to do this. Found y’all during covid and haven’t stopped watching since. Keep up the good work👏👏
You absolutely love to see it!
The mental image of all the good good parents waiting for their boys to visit. 🤣. Amazing thing you did Garrett.
That's sweet, young man. But did they need that money, or expect it from you? I truly wonder. They loved it, of course (it was from their son!) but I think you could have bought them a thoughtful gift and that would have been just fine. Never mind. They have your back in ways you might never understand - until you have kids of your own!
Just made a grown man cry… this is incredible. May God continue to bless you!
Best video you made period
If there is anything in this world I am jealous of, its this right here. Proud of you Garrett.
Goals
Dude I legit cried I did something similar to my mom and I know the feeling surreal, definitely hard to hold it in.
Man this hit me in the feels. I just been thinking about this lately if I were to ever get big money I’d pay back my parents for everything they did for me. Proud of you brotha!
This is wonderful ❤ I'm thankful for you and your parents! What a wonderful experience to share. It made me smile and brought tears of joy. GG
Congratulations Garrett, stuff a kid can only dream of to give back to your parents, the work you put in is truly inspirational!!!
Love this!! But Garrett needs a bigger shirt
Simply amazing! I am a 43 year old who was a very good player when i was younger. I can still get it around the course pretty well but with me only playing maybe 5 to 8 times a year for the last 10 years mainly in scrambles the game has gone downhill over the years not to mention I got terribly out of shape which doesn't help the game. Anyway to not make this too long of a post you are not only inspiring younger kids you are inspiring all ages. So far in 2022 I have started trying to get in better shape and I have been at the range as much as possible and to the course a few times(tough to get out with my work schedule sometimes) A lot of that inspiration comes from Good Good and the love I lost for golf is back and it is bigger than ever I would say I am not only committed to being a very good player again I am obsessed and in love with golf again. I hope to meet you guys one day to thank you in person. What your doing for the game is huge and I think the tour and its players notice that and I think you guys have a lot of big things coming your way if the tour is smart anyway. This video just shows your character and I imagine all the other guys are the same so keep doing what your doing you guys are changing lives!
So proud of you man been watching y’all since day one keep it up many blessings to yall
Good Good!  Awesome to be able to do that!!
You are a good man.......
How awesome!
Great job  man you deserve it. You got me choked up as well I don’t blame you for this being the first thing you wanted to do parents are everything
Congratulations brother
Well done mate head down keep it moving forward your killing it
Awesome! I'm 42 so not a kid. And watch every video posted. My kids where talking about YouTube when it first came out. Wanting to make videos. Kinda korny what they where doing but getting to this point is unbelievable. Yall are truly stand up guys. If I could ever pay my parents back a portion of that to get that feeling. Amazing Good Good.
Get these damn onions away from me!
Should invest
Dope !
Yoo…Who’s cutting onions… love this! 👏 🙌
Garrett, well done. Your heart for your parents is incredible. I couldn’t watch without it touching my heart. Fantastic.
I was subscribed when your dad was following you around with the camera. You’re very inspirational Garrett. Keep this up my man
This has always been my dream as well. Always give back to the most important people in your life. 💚
Better than any shot you guys have ever hit... well played sir well played
Micah always has his coffee man
One day I am gonna do something just like this!
🙌🏾🙌🏾
I crying all the way from Sweden, damn man 🇸🇪🫧
Brought a tear to my eye. You're a good lad.
Only ogs know that tami is out of the straw bag
this has to be such a surreal feeling. i can’t even imagine. congratulations, all of you deserve this so much!
your dads a beauty😂😂😂😂
Awesome!
Really cool to watch. I got chills with you. I watched you when you were sitting in your parents basement. Less than 1000 subs. You seem like a good guy, Garret.   I actually thought you had made the biggest mistake of your YouTube career when you broke up with Brody but clearly you’ve proven me wrong. Congrats on the success and I wish you nothing but best in the future.
That’s awesome man
This is awesome! Good stuff G!
Great gift dude. I really hope I can do something similar one day. Won't be as much but hopefully I can do something.
Pure class man.  So happy for you. Take care of those you love and who take care of you. Well done sir!
Dusty af in here
Tammy was definitely in the straw bag for this one
Dang bro . . . got me tearing up over hear just watching you so this!! Absolutely LOVE this. So glad to support you and the boys at Good Good if it makes things like this happen! 🏁☄️🏌🏼‍♂️
Dude that is super awesome. Made me also tear up and now a huge FAN!!
Moments like these are priceless to watch. Love seeing you give it back to your family my guy! Easily one of the most humble people I’ve followed on social media, and it’s truly inspiring!! Keep being you! ❤
This is truly Amazing. I dont know any of you personally and this average golfer from Greeneville TN hopes to meet you guys some day but I have been watching your videos for a long time now and feel almost as if i know you guys so with that said you successfully accomplished making my big ass tear up also. Special moment for sure. Congrats on being able to so this for your parents!
Inspirational brother🙌your content is awesome man🤙
Not gonna lie way better than Mr.Beast’s video.
Even in such an emotional moment, Tig has a cup of coffee
That was beautiful bro. Your a great son!!
This is absolutely amazing bro. So happy for all of you! Keep up the good work! God Bless Y’all!
What a great moment. That's what life is all about
Good stuff here.
Absolute respect
Garrett's mother looks like the relative of Tig.
Congrats to your success. Glad your parents raised you so well! Family always comes first.
You sound like a good man with a good head on your shoulders. Congratulations. Also if you ever want to bring the boys to Ontario Canada love to challenge your square to a Scrabble.
I definitely started crying when your mom did. I wish I could’ve done that type of thing for my parents, congrats Garrett!
THIS is my favorite video on all your channels!
Ok... so i even teared up a bit. Youre a good guy. Never lose that. I wish i was able to do that to my parents and inlaws as well since theyve both done so much for me and my wife over the years. Its special to be able to do that. Ive watched/subbed Good Good for a little while now and the least i can do is throw a sub your way as well for the appreciation youve shown to your parents. Never lose that love for them as your life gets busier.
Stand up move, Garrett. What a great moment.
Such a touching video. You might want to give 15k to each for 3 years plus an extra 10k on year 4 for tax purposes. You can gift 15k a year to family members without tax penalties...
congrats G
This was a great moment. Glad you’ve had the success you’ve had to be able to do this for your parents.
Good lad .
I love how you can recognize what ur parents did for you and how thankful you are bro. A lot of people grow up privileged and don’t realized what their parents did for them. All respect ✊🏾
That was an awesome thing you did for your parents, every son or daughter strives to give back to their parents in some type of way. I'm proud of you Bro, you and the guys from Good Good keep doing what you are doing!👏✊🏌️‍♂️⛳
Geez man, you had me tearing up too. Awesome.
Good job G-Rat.  I wish i could do that for my parents because they dug me out of a deep hole at one point.
You guys are special in more ways than just golf talent. And I think that has subtly shined through for quite a while now. Your kind of generosity always gets rewarded down the road. No one knows how or why, but it just does. Keep being great Good Good.
Tammy is no longer going to be piSsEd!
That is awesome! The thought is so much more than the money.
If only there were more Garrett Clark's in the world! You're amazing! I'm a fan for life.👍
I wish I had parents like yours brother. Mine are amazing and have said I've done well by them but you and good good are such an inspiration to so many, on a few levels, that all y'alls videos are hitting close to home for so many.  ... People seem to think envy, greed and being better than the next person IS the driving force that leads to success ... BUT ! You and ALL of Good Good (in their own domains) are living examples of how love is the only driving force that really matters.  Thank you (ALL). I have nothing but respect for all of you !  -- peace and love brothers --
Good young adult , good parents ,good upbringing
Mad respect! Beautiful to watch!
😭 this is awesome, man. Love to see it
This was awesome. As a new dad my idea as success is raising successful kids. Successful not defined only by Financials but as a good human beings. I only know you on camera but you are a good young man and there is no doubt in my mind your parents know they've succeeded in raising you. Bravo to you Garrett!
If this video didn’t make you tear up you are doing life wrong! Great job Garett!
my guy
Tig is always holding his coffee
Congrats to you dawg!  You’ve worked your butt off and the rewards are great!
well fuck now I'm crying
Best video I'll see in some time! Great job Garrett!
This was great 😊
Glad that you have a mother and father that helped make your dreams reality. God doesn't bless the undeserving
Really hope I can get to a point in my life where I can reward and thank my parents like this. ❤
What an incredible young man
Making a grown man cry! Keep up the great, amazing work.

You’re a fine man Garrett Clark. Humble, kind, genuine. I’m sure your parents are extremely proud of your accomplishments!
We’re all proud of you Garrett.
This is the first time ever commenting on a video this brought happy tears to my eyes Garret. This is exactly why I follow and buy good good merch anyone can go and buy any of the big brand apparel but supporting these guys to do things like this for their family makes it that much more worth it, I can guinely see the tears of joy you had doing this, one day I pray I can do the same. Congrats Garret
You're great son!!! Great job!
Amazing video to watch, Garret!!!   Love watching the vids from all the guys in the group!
so happy for you man. hard work pays off
Garrett please go to the doctors and get that lump on your neck checked because I saw that it could be cancer, just being safe
Well done G, all ways look after your parents.  From one Clark to another, proud of you dude
This is amazing.
Good on you Garrett. Very happy that you are in a position to do something that awesome for your parents.
That is awesome man!! Such a huge moment for you all!
Been watching you since the early days when Steve couldn't even look into a camera. This hits different when I feel I've been on a journey with you. All the best to you and your parents!
Happy for you!😀😀
I’ve been following your channel from the beginning g and goof good crew y’all always lighten my day . Made me tear up watching this good shit guys
Dam who's cutting up all these onions bro, a truly heartfelt moment, all you guys seem like genuine good dude and that's always been the draw to you guys for me, i too had this same dream from watching probably the same video you did but i failed at YouTube and unlike you i gave up so you deserve it man. P.S your parents seem like gems!
Good job pal.....
I hope the day I can do that for my mom she deserves it and working my tail off in many areas to achieve that one day
Happy to see someone young give back and stay humble! Always remember where you come from!!!

made me get back into golf again and i greatly appreciate it. College tennis to my new love golf couldn't have done it without yall
Cool move!!
This makes it extra special bcuZ of how genuine Garrett is. Never seems to be egotistical or acts better than anyone. You always try and help.
Don't usually comment on YT videos but this is an amazing thing you've done for your parents. Props to you! Never forgetting your roots!
All we needed was a sound clip of Matt saying "Tami's gonna be... PLEASED" for it all to come full circle
Proud of you man. Good stuff .
Dude you’re setting the bar a little too high for us mere mortals.. But at the same time that was awesome! You’re my favorite Twig !!!
Take it all in man! You’ve always been my inspiration to me. Keep up the good work! You will always have my respect.💪🤟⛳️
This moment gives meaning to all the hard work, time, sweats and tears. Happy that you have reached this milestone, and hope many more to come!
The freaking king 👑🐐 you’re great brotha
Cool way to reward your parents for their love and support! I hope others so fortunate follow suit
I’m only a few months younger than you and I am looking forward to the day where I can do the same for my parents. Hopefully over the next few years! Congrats Garrett!
❤️ 💙 💜.. 😢 😭 😿  😃 😊 😀
I’m 60 years old and I love watching all of the Good Good content and all of the individual member’s content. Proud of you all.
A golfer who loves his parents, god, and golf. what else could you ask for?
Incredible! Congrats Garrett
There's always some fucker around cutting onions ...
🐐🐐
My dad passed a few months ago. This really hit me. You're a good person. Keep it up brother
BRO. WHY AM I CRYING
You are the man Garrett
have to say I really appreciate how humble and hard working you are. I love the videos and I know how much work you have to put into them. Kudos to you and your drive all while being down to earth and grateful for it all. Wishing you and all of good good continued success
This had me in tears! Great content creator with a great heart for his fans and family. It’s every child’s dream to be able to give back to his/her parents a fraction of what they did for them. Thanks for being a great guy and role model to kids and adults alike.   Glad to be a part of yours and Good Goods journey! Keep up the hard work and great content!!
What a great son you're a great person
Legend God is amazing
Wow that was a good video you even had me in tears
You’re a good one man. It’s obvious you were raised right. Way to give back and take care of those that took care of you!!
Absolutely one of the best things I've seen on YouTube or any kind of social media.  This is beautiful.  Makes me wish I could have done this for my folks before they passed away.  This beats Matt's hole in one. 🙂  I can tell you're a good Christian man Garrett. God has blessed your life.
Money doesn’t always buy happiness but giving it away to loved ones  sure does . Unreal stuff G
You got every grown man on YouTube watching this tearing up.

That was awesome thanks for sharing. I had to look for my box of Kleenex.
So, Tammy won't be pissed anymore, right?
I’ve watched every video since 2019 and this is the best one!
Thank you for sharing this with all of us. Many, many more years of success...
The tears are flowing! Love it and this is awesome.
Wow...thanks for sharing
I am very proud of you Garrett... I have no word to describe how precious parents' love for their children is. But I am sure they are very proud of you and appreciate your care for them... God bless you and your heart...
My respect for you Garrett just went up so much more . This is a goal of mine to do for my parents. They came from another country and gave up their dreams for me and my siblings and I want to just be able to do something like this for them. Seeing them makes it seem very possible cause I know it’s hard 🙏 massive Respect man !
hey man, been following you since you were doing trick shots, you are one inspiring young man.  Congrats on all the success, and keep up the good work!  golf community needs more people like you for growing the game!
he may be a rat but hes Grat wholesome man keep it up!
That’s awesome man! God bless you and your family and god bless the good good team!!
Why the hell am I crying?
This is amazing man. What an unreal thing to be able to do. Your parents raised a good one!
Garrett, so impressed.  Your parents should be very proud.  And to have micah and Bubbie there along with ya shows what friendship and support all the Good Good  guys are all about.  World would be so much better with people like you guys.  Keep up the great work!
Beautiful moment, Garrett. Congrats on all your success!
wow, so much love.  more than any amount of money, the gesture, for the parents, validates all of the love and effort put into raising their kid.  they have to be on cloud nine over their son being such a thoughtful human being.  good stuff...
Now I am crying! Your Mom and Dad are so sweet! The Farm House Table is beautiful! Wow!
This is the real goal in life
My main question is, did your parent have any idea about the kind of money you've been making off of YouTube?
Well done mate your parents will be so proud of you 👏
So awesome! Knowing where you came from and the ones who made you the man you are today deserve it! Your parents raised such a fine young man and it shows in every video we are fortunate to watch. All of Good Good golfers are gentlemen. You are so Blessed!
Congrats man this is an amazing accomplishment. Wishing you all the best!
awesome vid my man!!!  u will definitely be going further with this mindset!!! keep up the good work
Tammy’s gonna be pisseddddddd
you're the man garrett!
Wow! You’re such an amazing guy Garrett. Well done.
Amazing, truly amazing!
Absolutely wrecked me. So awesome, man. Seeing a loving and supportive family in action just hits different.
Could have happened to better people. Nice to see there are other real people out there that have the right priorities. Glad someone like you had had this kind of success and have inspired others to get into golf that may not have.
Loved what your dad said, you’ve never done it for the money. Absolutely beautiful moment. 🥲
Hey Garrett be really proud your self you stay a human stay on this path ....... Appreciate it you share with us
G you are great guy. This is awesome and warms my heart. Your parents have raised a great man and we can tell they are very proud of you! Much love
GOAT

Heart of gold brutha
The best.

This is a life goal of mine, big congrats man!
This is one of those special moments y’all with remember forever!
Your a great young man. You recognised and gave back to those that allowed you to fly. Good on you man. I'm 57 but to watch a young person to do the right thing. Made me feel better. Grant still has the greatest golf swing. Lol

Good for you Garrett, we're proud of you brother.. Keep up the Good Good work, most of us are here for life at this point.
Didn’t figure I would cry on a Monday afternoon
I felt that on another level. I have so much respect for you and all of good good and you showed today exactly why
Who is cutting onions damn it?! 😢
Love you guys
This is awesome dude congrats
Who the fuck is cutting onions… damnit lol
This is awesome man
I almost never comment on videos, but if there’s anybody that deserves the success it’s you and all the guys in Good Good. The content is genuine, and you guys are all awesome. Congratulations dude.
You are a special kind of person. I can tell the first time I saw you. Can't wait till you try to go pro. It would be fun to watch
youre a real on garrett ! love to see stuff like this 🖤
This really is the most genuine group of people I’ve ever had the joy of watching over the past year or so since I discovered you all. There’s A LOT of channels and people on this platform but I don’t know any group that comes across more mature, friendly, and we’ll rounded than Garrett and all of Good Good.
This is awesome man what a feeling
Well friggin done young man, well done.
Damn this is awesome. I’ve been watching since the very beginning and it’s even hard for me to wrap my head around how for you have come. Keep killing it man, you motivate me.
Hell ya dude!! Congrats on everything man!!
Good for you man that’s awesome.   Personally I would delete this video and do a rescind video. Before Uncle Sam sees it.
Bro Garrett this is the biggest W in your YouTube career. Being able to give back to your parents especially on this level is something that I even look forward to doing. These are exactly the kinds of things besides the golf content that keep me coming back to your main channel, the vlog channel and of course Good Good.
This is what it's about my man! You were raised right and your parents are surely proud!
Tammy is NOT gonna be pissed! 🥹
Love to see it
“Just being yourself is enough of a gift for us”, hearing that probably made it all worth it
What a class move, nice one Garrett
Good Good’s greatest moment!
We wouldn't be watching if it wasn't for you guys making the amazing content
What a cool moment!
This is why we watch you. #biggerthangolf ❤️
That’s amazing. You’re truly an inspiration to me and a lot of people. Keep up the great work.
Inspiration bro💯🙏 I’m gonna make this happen for my parents one day 🙏🙌
Good on you, Brother. It is impossible to overstate the power and love we get from a supportive family  The greatest part of this gift is them knowing they raised a son who would do this. The money is just a nice extra.
"It rhymes with checkbook" would be a great shirt. Loved it
I’m not crying…you’re crying
Awesome
Legend
It would mean something, and more genuine if you weren’t posting it for pats on back. 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
I hope to do the same one day ! Garret what a inspiration ! I don’t even know if u will read this but know garret what u r doing is special ! Love u rat even tho I’ve never meet u lol
Some big pee pee energy in this vid.
Damnnnn bro! You can’t make a grown man cry like that!! I feel you bro that’s been one of my dreams since I was a kid. It hasn’t happened yet but hopefully one day soon!
Wow G.
What a goat
Garret the goat
Wow! That is super inspirational! Now I feel like crap...haha
You’re the man Garrett! This was amazing to watch man.
You have some amazing parents my guy. Good on you for giving them back some of the love they showed you for so many years. ❤❤❤
So dope❤️❤️
Inspirational! Good good is the reason I golf and this is just so dope, keep it up man
No need to hold it together. REAL men do cry.  And that's GoodGood.  What a great example you are to everyone watching.  God is blessing you with us and us with you. Keep being humble and smiling.  Peace to you all  GoodGood guys.
What a wonderful thing to be able to do for wonderful parents.
What an accomplishment to do! Congratulations
Good Man G. Congrats
Give them another $150,000 and you'll have repaid them for raising you.
So awesome man, Big ups
Tammy can now get the pans of her dreams!
Well done Garrett. Very inspirational
Love this dude. I think we can all appreciate getting to witness it. Happy for you all!
Wow!!! This may be the best thing I have ever watched on your channel.  I have been a big fan ever since I found your channel, but more now than ever. You are such a great guy. I truly wish all you guys the very best.
I cried. Well done Garrett.  Your parents raised a good kid.
This is why Good Good is special.  Way to go Garrett.
It’s Hayfever ok!! I’m not crying
what a good person you are, not many people that are real like this.
I am a father, so I can speak from that perspective. I’ve been watching your(all of the group) videos for a while now. I knew from the very 1st video, that you guys were all really good kids. I’m sure that your parents are SUPER proud of your success but even beyond that, they can be proud of themselves for raising such a good man!  It’s comforting as a parent to know that your child can provide for himself so much so that he gave back. Never met any of you but I feel pride in all of you guys success. Keep going because there’s no limit to what you can accomplish!!!! Vlog of the year!!!!😂
Everyone Liked that
What a guy👑
Love to see this! Keep it going man!
W garrett
Love to see it. Well done🙌🏼
Someone’s cutting them damn onions man
Hopefully you wasn’t dumb enough to mess with taxes. If so then you shouldn’t have done it on camera
Such supportive parents and I’m so glad it worked out so well for you after the NCAA rules bullshit years ago
This is awesome man, congratulations! 🤘🏼
Something we should all do for our parents who sacrifice so much. Such a big accomplishment. Congratulations!
Ok i am not crying here. What a great soul Garrett is. Great guy.
Your mom really did the "read the card before looking at the money" that we've all done with our grandparents at Christmas before. Congratulations G-Rat. You're a legend
Not me crying at my moms table while watching this lol
Wow Garrett this is just straight up amazing. I know your parents are super proud of you. You are awesome 👏
Felt every word bro! So proud of you G! I’m cryin with you
W video, W Family, W Friends, W Fans.

What an outstanding man you are, Garrett. Kind of lost it when your Mom said "just being you is a gift enough for us."  Great people raise great people. Thank you for sharing this moment with us, and for all that you've done for the game of golf - cheers brother!
Wow! What a beautiful moment. You’re a real one, G-rat

I lost my 20 year old son 16 months ago to cancer. We had a special bond. Watching G do this brought tears to me
Such a well deserved moment garret! Keep the content coming and we’ll keep supporting.
Tamie gunnna beeee rich 🎉

Every child's dream is to make their parents proud. Garrett you are a great guy and keep up the good good work.
Well done. Parents give so much expect so little..to watch you go from back yard trick shots to where you are now. Amazing and a reward for all the effort.
Hell yeah man
goat doing goat things
You’re the best Garrett!
You are a good man Garrett!  You have amazing family so it’s nice to see you give back. I’ve talked to you a few times at destination Dallas and one of the nicest guys I’ve met. Keep up the great work.
You and your parents are amazing!! Loved this video. If only more people in the world was like yous
I genuinely love the emotion. Seeing how big videos are now and the production of it and still being humble behind the camera. Keep moving forward!
You are a beast.  Amazing job

Bruh got me crying too
Bro I am balling over here!Jesus Christ! Amazing stuff. This is the ultimate goal, to take care of your parents. This is great stuff man.
Warett Wlark
You have some great parents man, your moms reaction says it all
well done mate, I wish to do so one day as well
Looks like a great family, congrats man.
Must be surreal, congratulations. The hard work paid off
Here me out. I specifically have one on one contact with your generation each and every day. I can say that you were raised the right way. No monetary mean will ever top the gift you give your parents. It is hard enough to raise kids in this day and age but even more rewarding when they don't turn out like a rotten egg. Good  Good has the best of the best and what you are doing for the youth and for your generation is beautiful to watch. Way to go buddy and congratulations.
Garrett man that's awesome of u giving back to your parents I think thats a blessing of u man also I was on my way from St Louis MO for the live stream and my car broke down but I can't wait to see them hit the Tube keep up the great work brother
Good on you man. You are a kind person with a good heart, or should we say Good Good Heart, and you should be proud to be able to be so real in this digital medium. Huge fan. Good on you!
KING!!!
Garret you should be very proud of yourself what a fine young man you are.
Had me tearing up. You’re a good man.
Don't hold the tears. Those are the tears of a boy becoming a man. Showing people what is right in the world.
Speechless....just AMAZING!!!
This is just amazing. I watch y'all so much it's like I know you somehow. Not sure why it's so emotional for me. Very blessed career, and very fortunate to do that for your parents.
Incredible moment buddy. 😄
Hey man, I'm a father now. My kids are young but I never knew why my parents invested so heavily in me. I, like you, found out college wasn't for me. My parents were disappointed since academics was easy for me. But they still supported me. They still invested in me.  Now that I have kids, I understand that most parents just want their kids to be happy and succeed in life. That's why we give to our kids continuously and unconditionally. Your mom & dad wanted you to pursue your dreams and for you to be HAPPY.  If you ever have kids, you'll understand. It's hard to understand until you're holding your little one and all you can think about is how much you want for them in life.  You did a great thing giving back. I've been doing the same, giving back in chunks. It feeds the soul.
great to see you honor your parents ! Keep up the good work.
Garrett:  No need to hold it back bud.  Your a good kid, your parents raised your right!  They are awfully proud of you and what you have done!  I like the videos, but I like them a lot more now!
Garrett you and the good good boys are the reason I got into golf over lockdown last year. i cant thank you enough. you and your family deserve the best! top man
Respect dude. That was amazing! There are millions of things you could've done with that money but it takes a certain type of person to do what you did. They raised a good kid!
Wow. What a moment 😍🥲
Love this video. Stay humble and always keep family first. Both my parents are gone now. Keep sharing your success with them always because they got you there.
Garrett this is awesome! God bless you and your family bro!
onions man... dang onions...
As a long term fan, I’m so proud of you Garrett. This is a dream of mine as well. Your parents did a good job with you. They deserve it and so do you. Looking forward to what the next years bring you. Sky’s the limit
Deuteronomy 5:16 Honor your father and mother, as the Lord your God commanded you. Then you will live a long, full life in the land the Lord your God is giving you. Well done Garrett!
Hell yeah G. You work so hard so fully deserve to be able to do this!
Probably the best vlog you've done to date!!very humbling to be able to do that!!!!!side note you should have put the check in a box of new pots and pans!!!!!!payback for the Tammy's gonna be pissed video🤣🤣🤣
I think that's every kids dream man I'm happy for you
well done.
Way to go man.  Keep a good heart and you'll go far in life.  Great to recognize your folks for what they have done for you.
Awesome stuff Garrett. Congrats on your hard work
I have been watching you for a long time. You and tigs sunday match was my weekly youtube highlight. Add grant to the mix and i now have three people i never miss an episode off. I am 54 and live down in Aus. I have three kids all around your age. So watching what you just did then had me tearing up. Very bloody cool mate. Keep up the good work. Look forward to years of entertainment.  I think you should find a way to do a month in Australia one day. Some serios golf courses and the weather is pretty special.
You’re the man G!!
Watching this makes me so proud I was able to get a Good Good polo and support you guys!
Huge W. Amazing video, and so happy you were able to do this for your family.
Bro this amazing!!!
Awesome job Garrett!
This hit hard!! I'm a huge believer in taking care of your parents and you'll be blessed with more. Great job Garrett. ♥️♥️
Much Respect. God Bless you Brother on your many journeys.

Congrats man, never an easy thing to accomplish in life.
GOOD(People) GOOD(Vibes)
I’m not crying… You’re crying… OK, we’re all crying. 🥹🥹 Great job Garrett.
No chance you're making me blubber like a baby at 5:39PM on a Monday!  Congrats, Garret. You deserve it and they deserve it. You are an outstanding role model for many, and I think I speak for everyone when I say this, thank you for your contribution to the game of golf.
TAMMY’s GONNA BE PISSSSED
I’ve been following you since GM golf only had 6k subscribers. It’s every son’s dream to give back to their parents in a way that goes beyond what even seems possible. You’re killing it G! Keep it up!
That's what it's all about. Nice work G.
Good job you're a great son.  My son is 3.5 yearsold right now but i'm expecting the same from him! you set the bar bro:)
There not wrong you and the gg guys have helped a lot for golf and for happiness and well being I love the content  That’s huge man well deserved
It’s so nice to see someone who recognizes and appreciates what their family has done for them. None of us are entitled to the great things people do for us. Good on you Garrett for being such a great young man and son.
Hell yes brother
Respect. 🙌🏾
You restored my faith in mankind there G 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
love this wholesome stuff you are amazing
Is someone cutting onions in here? Good stuff G.
What a sweet video! Many tears were shed on this end
Beautiful bro
FUCKING LEGENDARY. G Rat Clark, been here for a long time and I love your channel. Keep going!!!!!!!
Great video and obviously great parents. You are very blessed to have a mother and father like them.  That being said--Sunday Match 3 Clark.  Stop being a wuss.
I didn't expect to cry so early in the morning over here in Aus 🇦🇺 😭 Very touching in many ways! You're a true gentleman Garrett!
What a good thing to do, has his head switched on 👏🏼
That's gotta be one of the best feelings in the world! Do what makes you happy, as long as it includes making content 😜👊💙
Good job, much respect.
Beautiful man x
That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen omg
I’m not crying you’re crying
good on you mate, I got choked watching this 🙏🏼
Well played G! you were a great kid! Now on the way to a great man! Keep making vids & we will keep watching em!
TAMMYS GONNA BE…not pissed?
Any one else have trouble with this video like buffering or just glitching a little with audio? Just trying to figure out if it’s just me
Everyone liked that.  Unbelievable man. This is awesome.
What a top lad
Respect to you G for the respect for your parents. Trust me when theyre gone, it hurts. Make the most of the time you have with them. No regrets bro..🤙🏾
What a gift your mum and dad must be so proud amazing 👍
Amazing to see. You and they deserve it so much. Congratulations ❤️
Good stuff my guy
You know hes a humble man, when he doesnt put ANY sad soppy ott music in the background to make it more emotional. Showing just pure love. Big love to him and his family xox
You’re a great person. Such great values and obviously great parents.
Ofcourse my guy Micah drinking a cup of coffee hahah
best video loved it it is also one of my dreams to be able to pay back my parents for what they did for me.
I can't like this video enough!!!!
It’s crazy watching the people that make you so happy everyday actually become emotional over something makes you actually feel for them  This is awesome rat congratulations
Made me cry. Such an awesome young man.   Also for those who watch the videos on some sort of streaming device and don't see the subscribe option. You need to do a search for that particular channel where it will lead you to that channels homepage and the subscribe option. I think that's why many are not subscribed who watch. Of course it's right there on your PC or phone. But you have to look a little bit when only watching on some streaming devices. All these young men need that support!!!
Well done man. So heartwarming
I'm 30 and can't wait to do this for my dad one day. It won't be that much money but I want to surprise him with something nice. You're so lucky to have the family you do, never take it for granted
Tami’s not gonna be pissed
Bro. That was a lot. ❤️
Love this! So kind & humble ❤️
I definitely remember Tammy from the OG golf vlog videos!   What a huge way to show your appreciation, there truly is no way to show our parents just how much they mean to us and have done for us, but this is something they'll never forget! Huge props!   Your channel(s) are such a huge success because of the circle you keep and the positivity y'all bring, not only to the sport of golf but as a group of friends! We feel like we're a part of it!
Your mom is the sweetest. You have great parents man, it’s so good to see the values they instilled in you come out like this. You seem like a great guy on the content and I can see it’s true by your parents! Much love to GM golf and all the good good guys!
If this didn't make you cry you're lying
Awesome moment G! Cool to see both these channels grow
So touching man! That's awesome. I'm not crying
I am proud of what you were able to accomplish and I am sure your parents are as well. As a parent all you every want to know is that your child will be ok. Having the ability to write that check lets them know you are. They will continue to worry about you and be your biggest cheerleader.
What a G! Love it bro
I knew your parents before watching this video, because I see their values in how you live your life.  They are just how I imagined them.  And the immediate tax discussion was hilarious.  God bless your family.
ABSOLUTE UNIT OF A MAN YOU ARE.
Good on you Garrett. Pay it forward or pay it backward which ever way.
I'm not crying, you're crying
I gotta admit I wasn’t a huge fan of garret after the bro five split, but these past couple of years watching him grow and mature along with good good has been a pleasure to see. Very good on you man, glad to support your dream
Garret, Tammy can go out and buy the nicest set of pot and pans or replace the once Steve, Matt and you broke or lost on the the jr course lol...my youngest son is 11 now i would love for him to grow up and outstanding young man like you. Me being a parent i know you made your parents SO proud and will continue to as well as you grow in life....great job Garret 👏👏👏
Love you bro .. love this . I'm down in Sherman 45 mins away .. I love your vids and I'm proud of you .. this is awesome
Good man. Y’all are all humble in goodgood and y’all have a good team with matt kendrick at the helm. Goods good man
Congrats Garrett on all your success. You deserve everything you have and I’m glad you understand how lucky you are to golf for a living!
Legendary stuff man
My favorite YouTuber for a reason. Humble and selfless. Congrats on all of your success Garrett. You’ve earned every bit of it.
Legend ❤️
And this is why, at age 49, you and the crew are my favorite thing to watch, anywhere, anytime. I’ve said this many times but congratulations and thank you to your parents G 🙏🏻
Love this for you and all of goodgood GGs guys
is tammy now out of the straw bag
this is my new favorite video on youtube garrett i love you man
I plan on doing the same for my mother. I got about 10k or so Togo. All from hard work and passion for my work but I promised her I would do it. As a man holding up to your promise and giving back to your parents is worth more than anything!   Much love
Congratulations Garrett, what an amazing gesture 👊
This hits hard for me as a dad but what makes it hit even harder, just 3 days ago I was sitting just off the green on hole 6 at the short course listening to your dad talk to another older gentleman about how proud of you he is and how your love of golf and sheer determination are why you've come so far. As much as you want to give your parents credit for your success, I can only imagine that as a parent, your dad puts all of that success on you. We as dad's can give you every leg up in life, private coaches, a putting green in the back yard, driving you to tournaments, etc. But at the end of the day, there's only one person who has the ability to either put in the work and grind until they finally break through or break under the pressure and quit before they fully realize their potential. Your dad is able to see that it was you who put in the work, you who grinded day and night, you who grabbed your group of friends to not only help you reach greater heights but to also pull them up alongside you. This is why it hits so hard, because as a father who wants to give my son every advantage in life that I can, I can only hope that he exhibits the same amount of sheer grit and determination as you and the rest of the Good Good crew have.
dang g-rat, you got me crying before my exam tomorrow morning. you are the most wonderful person, you and your parents deserve the world, so do the good good crew. 2022 is your year, even better than the amazing years before. keep smashing it.
Nicely done.
Good stuff man. I hope my kids feel like this about me when they get older.
Aye man, you keep doing you. Keep up the good work
This was sick G. I'm happy for you big-time. With an attitude like you have, there is no doubt you are going to make major waves in this life. The doors that will open for you will be endless. Keep on keepin on playa!!!
Wow, very impressive young man!  Setting a great example for all the young new golfers.
You are a genuinely good guy!!!
I'm a 77 year old father and grandfather. My kids have been so good to me also. What you've just done is amazing. May you continue to be blessed, and give blessings. BTW my eyes are gushing.
No need to hold it together. Let your emotions flow brotha, that’s mom & dad. I respect it more if the tears are flowing. You’re more of a man in my book if you do. Much love & respect
Started watching on my break at work. Had to stop so I could compose myself for the rest of my shift. Congrats man, way to give a little back!
Got a crazy amount of respect for you man. Long time subscriber all the way back to the junior course wheel of not ideal days! You are selfless guy, take notes people….. Tammy’s gonna be piiiissssseeddd
Garret this is so cool man! Love to see it can't wait to do this for my parents too!
❤️❤️❤️
I'm not crying you are. Good for you G.

I cried watching this
Tammy is finally in the straw bag

Your a amazing person bro. Keep killing it and you deserve the best
Absolutely love this
Unreal! Good on you Garrett! You are right most in your position would put that money to the things they want. You put it where it was deserved!
Humbleness at its finest ❤️

Amazing 👏👏👏 they deserve it and you deserve to be able to do it! Worked hard to get where you are
You're incredibly fortunate that your parents did great not only in raising you, but in supporting you in your dreams.  I think your gratitude is genuine and I'm so happy for you and your success. You guys have changed the golf scene on YouTube and you Garrett are the driving force behind it. Celebrate your wins and share your success with the ones you love. This is the best video you've ever done and it's not about the money at all. Thanks for sharing! 👊
I’m biggest fan fan of all good good and everyone in the team but without being rude this is the best video I’ve ever watched on YouTube,TikTok,insta,Facebook anything because all of you are just the most down to earth and humble people and I can’t wait for you guys to inspire more people ❤️
Lot of years flowing on this one.  Garrett
I had a similar experience when I gave my mom a $25 gift card to Olive Garden for mother's day 😛😛

My inspiration!
This is so pure a good for the soul.
What exactly happened with Brodie? I started watching you guys back in like 2017 and it all just disappeared one day.
Beast mode! Amazing
Just because you seem genuinely thankful, I’ll go buy your $75 shirt
Hands down best video.

Absolute class!
Real men show real emotions. Congrats man
Great video Garrett, what an amazing moment that must've been. I can only hope to do the same one day!
Holy shit, I love this so much
This channel may be the one I am most proud to support - and each and every person involved in it. Fantastic.
Damn the 4k looks hella good
Congrats brother. Making me cry 😭
Your dad said it best, God has rewarded you in so many ways!
Way to Garrett, God Bless you all
This is a very touching video Garrett. You’ve matured a lot in the last couple years and it shows. I too want to do this for my parents someday. Although they haven’t always been supportive of my dreams, I still wouldn’t have been able to pursue them if not for all they did for me. Well done my man. Well done.
You're a good man, Garrett. Your parents should be proud for raising such a good person. We need more of you in this world.
Love this, nothing beats repaying parents ❤️
How can you not root for this guy!
Nice man congrats u deserve it...$100k cash would've been dope though...
Atta boy Garrett! True inspiration in gratitude. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
👏🏻

Good or you young man! Respect............
Good work G. What your mom said was heart warming

I think everyone watching was crying, bro... I know I was...
This is motivation man! I’m going to be able to do this one day🙏
This is the wholesome content I love on YT… making me tear up man
its my dream to retire my parents
Omg can’t stop crying
That was awesome!
This is awesome dude. I can only imagine how amazing that felt. Congrats dude.
You inspire more people than you know. I watched that Mr.Beast video years ago and this made me feel the same way.  You inspire me to continue working harder everyday and to take life a step at a time. Life can move so fast sometimes and we all forget that.
Legend!
This is why I love 💕 you guys.  The Good-Good team are very positive and supportive group of young men.  Thank you
I love the emotion.  Amazing what you have accomplished and look forward to what you achieve next.
YouTube vids rarely make me emotional but this almost had me in tears
real tear jerker
Good stuff Garrett.
Recently subscribed. Man you got me by the boo boo. You a Good Good kid
To be watching you since the nighttime putting competitions in your back yard with Matt and Steve and Micah coming back. Arguing with Matt about the best cereal on a live feed to where you guys are all at now is amazing. You guys had me in tears in this video. So freaking proud of you all man seriously. You all have pushed me to strive so hard with everything to winning my first tournament this weekend at Monarch Dunes in Nipomo, CA to Bobby and his sobriety in which I have a year and 8 months I genuinely look forward to your guy's videos. Thank you very much.
My heart is so happy, man.   Well done Garret. Truly inspiring
You have earned and deserve everything you’ve worked for, Garret! So proud and happy for you. Can’t even imagine the feeling ❤️ Congrats
What a legend
I’m not crying it’s just allergy season
Mighty powerful stuff. Keep up the good work
This is amazing.
The fact that you and all of good good are people with great values and personalities make the channel what it is for me. There are plenty of other golf channels but none like you guys. Please never change and keep up the great work! 👍 P.S. the good good line of golf shirts are the best I've ever worn to be honest.
Had me tearing up!! Nice to take the ride with you!! Cheers to even bigger things!!
shoulda bought tammy a new pan
I hope you know you are the new mister beast now, and people will say you inspired them to do the same thing.  loved the way you gave back to the people who gave to you, keep it up.
Earned a subscriber for this one...good shit Garret 👏👏
*Everybody liked that*
Garret thats amazing. Super happy for you
Such a heart-warming story
BIG W ❤️❤️
Absolute respect Garrett! Love GG videos but this is just beautiful!
Your mom made me cry! You can see they're so proud of you. With or without success. Great parents. Respect
You are a good man, G. With excellent parents. You’ve surrounded yourself with equally high caliber friends and teammates. The next check you write could be for 10 times that amount. Love the genuineness of this video.
Tammy is Not going to be pissed this time yaya
Wow Garrett, just wow brother. We all wish that someday we can do this for those that supported us. Good on you brother. I have watched you for years and this is who you are. I see it everything you do.
Best video of the day my friend. You deserve all the success!!!
Such an awesome moment. We're all proud of you Garrett and it's because of things like this.

Pulled up to dislike, shouldn’t have to publicly brag about donating money to loved ones.
What an awesome family, so much love in that home!
🥲
Long hair and emotional. I just told my wife I’m leaving her for you . 😗. Congrats
That might be your greatest shot to date. Well done Garret.
Moments that make a goat right there.
Garrett Clark, you're far beyond most men in this world. Keep it up.
I want to be successful enough to do this someday too. You have no idea how many lives you have changed with your content
Amazing.  Love it.
Onion chopping ninjas everyone!!
legendary moment
Your heart is so pure.  I’m thankful to have found you guys in  YouTube. You are an inspiration for so many not just kids.  ❤️
I think that pays for the Pans Matt destroyed lol and Tammy is no longer gonna be pissed lol
“Just being you is a gift enough for us, it pays us everyday” damn dude his mom saying this really hit home :,)
Awesome job bro! Super emotional and well worth it! Congratulations!
Congrats, you deserve it
You're living the dream Garrett! I hope to be able to do something like this someday. Love the content.
$100k, is that all????!!!!!  You cheap ……GOTCHA!  Well done young man, well done!
this is why I support you guys!
So does this mean Tami is in the strawbag or out of it? I'm confused.
You deserve it all and more! Congrats on this milestone. MANY more are on the way 👍👍
You're a good person Garrett....always remember who sacrificed for you...and never said anything. And NEVER be ashamed of showing your emotions!
My dad would probably beat me if I tried to give him 100k.   probably won’t ever have to find out
Wow what a guy and congrats on being so successful. G is clearly such a good son and kind and so kind to his perants.
Proud of you Big guy
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Bro made me cry and I'm just a random guy
You are an amazing and inspirning guy Garret! Congrats from a Spanish guy for all your achievements and hope this to be only the beggining!
You should be real proud of yourself and of your parents too. they are good people and they raised u to be that way . this got me tearing up too
Eye leak on aisle 9.
Absolutely fantastic mate. Brilliant. Massive well done 👍🏼
Nice. A son who has appreciated everything his parents did for him.
Incredible
This was beautiful. Well done G
Really awesome stuff here Garrett; such a great message here that would do the world some good.  Keep up the great content
I’m sure Tammy isn’t going to be pissed anymore… #whoremembersthepan
This is why I follow and support GG, most solid guys on YouTube!
I’m not crying your crying 😢
Big fat W
Garrett you are genuinely the coolest dude. I've followed you from the old gm golf days and watching you grow and build good good and everything else that you have had been amazing to watch. It hits a special place in my heart because I've always wanted to make it big with music so I could do the same for my parents. Mad respect for you man, seriously. Keep doing what you're doing, seeing someone make it who is doing it for all the right reasons is such a beautiful thing.
Awesome stuff! Keep up the good work and God will continue to bless you
Man I smelled the onions through the video. This is so inspiring and I am about to start my channel. Thanks for all you guys do
Amazing well done G
@Garrett Clarke, what a beautiful gift to give to your parents. You have nothing to be ashamed about shedding a few tears. What's that saying 'boy's don't cry'. What hogwash!!  When parents support you to follow your dreams, its only right to give something back.  Keep up the good work with Good Good and bringing golf content every week.
So cool. Great work Garrett and Good Good. It is awesome to see what great people you guys are and that the hard work you put in pays off!
Awesome you could share that moment with everyone!
Legend, you have inspired so many people man.
All you need to know about a man is how he treats his parents.  Great family. Goals.
Special, but not really gonna matter once hyperinflation hits.  Good heart, but we all need to be ready.
This made me tear up GM golf😭😊
Damn those onions...lol
Enough to make a grown man cry 🥲 legendary
This was awesome to watch. Congrats on your success man, you can tell how proud they are!
Maybe Tammy can buy a new pan now.
You can always tell when these youtubers are (or aren't) genuinely kind hearted people. G-rat's  been A1 since the jump. The definition of a class act. Proud of you dude. Can't imagine how proud you have made your folks and that was before that 100k.
Beautiful man
A M A Z I N G !!! Thank you for sharing this with all of us.
Unreal man, Unreal. Happy for you and your success. You are amazing. It’s okay to get emotional, this doesn’t come around for everyone unfortunately. You have a great heart bro. Wishing you continued success for not only you but for good good as well. Stay Lit🙌🏻
Love this. Well played and love to see life events like this. Congrats on where you’ve gotten to this point!
Tammy's NOT gonna be pissed!
Garrett u truly are a great person for this world! No matter what u do u are a light in this world
You are awesome, G-rat 🥰
Absolutely amazing. Congratulations my man. Great group of people y’all got
Been watching you since the beginning Garrett, this brought me to tears. Congrats on everything you have accomplished so far man. Keep working and creating the best golf content on YouTube!
This is by far the best GoodGood video I've ever seen. Congratulations on your success and it's not a surprise to see your parents are wonderful people.
You and the Good Good guys are an inspiration to our next generation and I wish there were many more young people like you guys in this world. I do play golf weekly off 10 and love the Good Good vids.
This is awesome. You’re a good dude.
This is the Best video on youtube ❤️ At the end of the day there is more important this in life and that is what this video is about
You’re the man Garret! More and more blessings coming your way. Mark my words.
Awesome bro! 👊🏻
Love you bro you are the reason why I got into golf, and I also want to pay back to my parents  . Keep it up your amazing
Love you Garrett!
Lets go G! This is what it's all about. Good work and wish you more success! You deserve it!
Top kid. If my kids turn out half like you I'll be very proud. God bless you x
I have to admit, the first Good Good video I watched was the one with Matt's hole in one on the par 4.  My first impression of Garrett was "who is this dork?"  I soon realized that this dork was the visionary behind the best golf channel on YouTube.  He's a driven, creative, and talented young man who is obviously well grounded and well behaved.  I always appreciated the fact that GG doesn't use profanity and makes their content family friendly.  Kudos to mom and dad for raising Garrett so well, and to Garrett for honoring them.
Great job G!!!! Not enough ppl do stuff like that man great job!
Enough said ...👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻. 💪🏻👍🏻
🥲👏👏👏👏🤙🤙👍👍
Love this man. True role model
Garret, you are a class act!! What a great son you are!!
Absolutely love seeing this. Only wish for more exponential success for you and the good good crew
You deserve it brother!
Garrett still drives the same car he has had since the beginning.   really a great person and huge personality. he’s definitely a big reason why i got into golf and i’m sure why thousands of other kids got into the sport as well.
Thank you garret for giving the golf community something to look forward to. I can't wait to have this exact same moment with my grandparents. Truly one of my favorite YouTubers and someone to look up to, thank you garret.
Respect from sweden 👍
Don't think Tammy's going to be pissed at this! Amazing video Garrett, you're an inspiration to us all. I don't usually get emotional watching a youtube vid but this one deffo pulled on my heart strings. Also the self awareness to understand how much your parents did for you is amazing, can only wish I can do something similar in the future!
I love everything about this video.  Good on you, Garrett!  Congratulations to your parents for making a great guy.
Your parents couldn't be prouder!  Also, epic like to view ratio.
Great work, man. Big day
damn this made me cry
Incredible thing to do for you parents. Just shows what your hard work has done for you. Very well deserved.  Thanks for also sharing with your audience.
did anyone else have to pause it like 5 times to not start crying... well done garret
One of the things I like about the Good Good channel, and a major reason I come back every day, is how down to earth and pleasant all of you are.  You don't think of yourselves as "Rock Star Celebrities" that are better than everyone else.  This is an awesome thing you've done.  Garrett, the Lord said to "Honor thy mother and father" and you are a good son to have done so. I truly believe that soon there will be some golfers in the PGA and LPGA that are there because of the Good Good experience and inspiration.  You're great role models and that fact is solidified with this video.
Every kids dream, to take care of their parents financially.
You guys put out great content, glad it's paying off.
Wowww, this was amazing ❤️❤️❤️
Man this is so wholesome! I don’t know how I got on the good good guys, but it’s the best content on YouTube and these guys are so genuine! Side note: tig is always drinking coffee!
Tammy is NOT going to be pissed
This one definitely hit home. My dad passed away three weeks ago due to cancer. It was a very quick and hard hitting disease. The last conversation that I was able to have with him, a day and a half before he passed, was that he wanted me to have his truck. On top of everything that him and my mother have provided me over my almost 30 years of life, 2 years ago, my dad gave me a personal loan as we were going through some tough times. Since I am now able to sell my personal vehicle, I can fully pay back my dad, even though he's no longer with us, for that personal loan he gave me two years ago. Garrett, seeing your interaction with your parents, as well as describing what they have meant to you, brought me to tears. I'm sure that you are aware of this, but don't take these memories and the time that you have with your folks for granted. Thank you for sharing!
absolutely amazing buddy 👍
Your the type of role model these kids out here need! Keep doing your thing!
Never change, man❤️
I always like your stuff G...now even more
who the fuck is cutting onions!!!
This is why I was drawn to watch his videos, he has a sweet transparency that attracted me to what he does.  In fact, I see that quality in Micah as well.  Garrett, continue to honor you mom and dad and your days will long on this earth.
Wholesome stuff man.. hit me right in the feels this one. Big congrats and I also wish to emulate what you have achieved here in this video. Much respect and may you continue to succeed and prosper 👊🏽
WELL DONE, YOUNG MAN!!  Well done.
Garrett, you and your parents are absolutely amazing. Keep up being a role model for a lot of people! You’re best video ever!!!
Hell yeah Garrett
I never thought a Garret Clark vlog would make me cry like a baby...
Congrats bro
Awesome moment- that’s the reason your channel will always be successful. Don’t ever lose yourself to gain the world.
Lovely vid Garrett. You’re truly an inspiration for all of us. Keep being you. 🤍
I've only been watching you and the Good Good crew for a few months and clearly see that you are all a great bunch of people. This video is very inspiring. The world in general needs more people like you, Garrett. Keep being you!
Gotta love Tig with his coffee
Great parents and raised a great lad
This is sick Garrett. Very proud of you man. One could only dream of doing this.
Family is everything.
Amazing - I cried too!  Your parents are so so proud of you!
You guys are killing the game.  Club deals and way more to come just keep it up.  You guys will go far.
This is why I come back man. Such genuine guys. Could do so much stuff with it. And this is what he does. Grinds endlessly and it’s for stuff like this. Made me cry and I don’t even know any of them. Although I feel like I do. Unreal buddy. I appreciate Garrett more than he’ll ever know. Inspirational
love this boss.... you're gonna go far with a heart like that my guy!
Good to see so heartwarming
Well done Garrett, you're a great example! "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you." Exodus 20:12
Awesome Bro… very touching …
YOU ARE DOING IT! Congrats, im inspired to be doing this for my loved ones on day
who's cutting onions ??
Your fans are so proud of you Garrett
SO PROUD OF YOU. SUCH AN INSPIRATION
Well didn’t think I was going to cry today thanks a lot bud 😂😂
So amazing and inspiring!
Times when even real men cried…
Man this made me cry Garrett, amazing brother!!
A generous gift to your parents the ones who created you and show they love you unconditionally so well done young man i love your vlogs 👏👍
We need a Good Good And Mr Beast collabo ! Raise money for some trick shot to benefit something !
WHO IS CUTTING ONIONS?
What a video.
Well dag
Wow
This was the most humble video I’ve ever seen
Awesome my man! You definitely had me tearing up.
Just subscribed to this Channel what a beautiful first video to watch can’t wait to see some other ones :)
fantastic moment!! great job! and as a Parent, it would be tough to take that check... the reward for us parents, is the fact our child would even think of doing that!! means we did good!
Videos like this give you hope for humanity and show that there are still good people around
Remember when people made fun of Garrett for putting his parents on the phone with brodie? Probably the best decision he could have ever made!
tammy is indeed not pissed, and not out of the straw bag
Tammy won’t ever be pissed again !
Whose cutting onions? Congratulations Garret and thanks for the best golf content on YouTube 👏
This is amazing honestly I aspire to do this one day for my family. I’m tearing up.
Very very awesome! Congrats to you and your family
Garrett is the freaking man!!!
way to go garrett congrats on being able to accomplish a goal you had set videos are great 👍
Do what now
What a great accomplishment!  Would potentially save tax money to give it over time at $32k ($16k to each parent) a year to keep it from counting against gift/estate tax.
I'm not a person to comment on videos or cry but you managed to get me to do both. Called my parents to thank them right after watching this video. You're a true inspiration and I will be a fan for life. Keep it up man!
Legend
And that is what it should be all about, y'all! Just another reason I like watching all the vids you make, Garrett!
Best GM golf video ever !
W son W youtuber W person W soul.
Crazy man, I remember watching you guys at sunflower filming each other 3 years ago. Grateful for how grateful you are g
Damn dude, I haven't actually teared up like that in years. That was absolutely beautiful man🤙
What a legend G!!!
Thanks for making me cry in front of my girlfriend
"Just being you is a gift enough for us"......Wow... Powerful and true words from a mom to her son.  She is obviously proud of you
Jeez G lad. That hit me right in the feels big time. Fair play to you. Well done
Your a heck of good young Man G! This is awesome 🙌🏼
Pretty sure over 4,000 at this post time have got a tissue in their hands right now.
Garrett is the man
Wow man ! That video is powerful.
💪🏾👊🏾👏🏾!!!
Dude 😢 awesome stuff here, can tell your parents are incredibly proud of you.
This is amazing man!!! Had me in tears. I’ve been with ya since the beginning. Keep up the awesome work. It’s better to be a better person than a golfer!
You’re my hero
truly inspiring.
You have a great heart.  Your parents evidentally taught you well.  Keep up what you like doing.
G that was amazing, giving back to your parents is the best thing you could do. good stuff
I can only dream of doing this for my parents 🙏🏻🙏🏻
This is the best, what a man, you’re the best Garrett! Should be very proud of yourself mate!
I may or may not have cried a little bit myself at work.
This is the greatest video I’ve ever watched. Congrats Garrett
Congrats man
Respect
Been watching you since 30k subs and to watch your journey among the years has been beautiful, with gm golf and good good it’s been so fun to watch and I can’t wait to see how big you can grow the game much love brother
Garret you are the best man. You are the main reason I started watching good good. Being able to donate that much money to the people that always supported you is unreal. You and your family deserve the best 🙏🏼
Outstanding!! Now put away 1,000,000 and then give ‘em 100K more!!!
What a man 👏
Congratulations Grant.  Great moment
a wonderful son and a fine young man!
just stumbled upon the good good channel within the last two weeks as I am just getting back into golf and I just want to say Garrett, you are an inspiration to not only continue playing golf, but to be a better person. What you are doing for your parents and how much it visibly impacts you emotionally really hits home. Keep being you bro!
Good man 👏👏👏
If there was a way to like a video twice, this deserves it
Congrats Garrett!! Awesome road your on!!
Tammy was NOT pissed!!  Great job dude
W
It's a parents dream for their kids to just to grow up successful and enjoy life...Im a parent and that's all I want for my boy is just to be happy with every decision he makes in life no matter what direction it takes them...As a parent we never expect anything in return for these things....Congrats on your success and God Bless
I'm not crying, you're crying. WHO'S CHOPPING ONIONS? Gosh haha. Love all of this. ❤️❤️❤️
Well this warmed my cold dead heart ❤️ 💙
I'm just glad all my likes, comments, subscribes, and viewing time went to a great cause, happy parents!
Now that's what it is about.  You and all the fellas are good peoples.  Keep it up.
keep it up dude we are all here for your journey
Garret truly is the glue who has held good good together. He has fantastic business instinct, and has been an incredible leader. I am so thankful for his graciousness here and all throughout his time as a creator. He is an inspiration to so many golfers and even YouTube creators. Keep it up! The sky is the limit
Imagine having enough money to give you parents 100,000 dollars right. Then just film it, have a viral video and make bank off of the video. Seems like an incredibly fortunate situation and hope nothing but the best for good good.
keep grinding soon it’ll be $100,000,000 💯
As a father, I give you mad props for this, brother.  You are really a good-good guy.  Well done Garrett.
What an absolute legend. Man that’s an amazing thing to do. Keep doing what you do man
That’s the mail goal man. Legendary 🙏🏽
Garrett is such a genuine guy, what a freaking stud🙌🏼
Absolutely fantastic Garrett!!!  I watch all your videos and really enjoy them all.  You’re truly a “Good Good” guy.  Thanks Garrett for being so transparent and real.
Why am I CRYING
This man’s a good dude!
whos cutting onions G? You're a pure soul my man
This is a goal of mine!
Great vid man. Thx for sharing. I love that my son watches you guys and in turn has turned me into a fan as well
Good for you Garrett ! What an awesome way to show your gratitude as a son. Keep it up ! I will keep following you because of great things you do like this.
So genuine man! Been filling for along time and your just an awesome person! Congrats buddy
Love this!
Amazing.
<3
U guys are the reason I'm getting back into golf and my son is starting to play. It's a joy and pleasure to watch all the videos. Keep up the amazing work.
Man like G Rat
This is Beautiful. Teared up myself
Wow, 10 minutes of goosebumps!
Dude I have felt so connected through your videos and with the rest of good good. But this video hits in a different spot I didn’t even know existed. Congrats on everything man and keep it going
Brought me to tears too. Been watching you guys since the beginning. You get from the world what you give to the world. Never change brother.
So crazy! Hope I can do this same thing one day!
This is the true testament of your character. Keep changing lives!
I love how emotional you are talking about it , that’s real. I would be a wreck. Your a good dude man . A good good dude !
Wholesome af! Congrats gman!
She’ll be able to replace the pan Matt destroyed now!!!!
So awesome!
Tami is definitely not pissed
Wholesome. Extremely wholesome.  Going to go buy a GoodGood hat now.
Good on you Garrett. You are a beautiful person. Your parents probably get enough back just seeing how wonderful a man you've become. But, it's beautiful what you did.
You are such a great person! Just reading the title and watch you almost start crying made me cry!❤️
Respect
Proud of you!!
🐐
You know he means it when he puts this on the 2nd channel
Very cool ma keep doing your thing
good job G...
W Clark's 💯
Legit one of the most genuine and nicest guys on YouTube. You and all the good good team are absolutely smashing it.
Congrats! No one more deserving! Keep grinding and staying humble never change
Awesome Garrett.  I don’t know you at all but for your videos.  One thing I have always liked was how genuine you are.  All of you are.  Amazing young man!!
I had some tears even... well done.
I’m not crying you’re crying❤️❤️
"That's gonna be good for about 20 years." Jerry holding it together haha. Supportive parents are the best! I remember seeing the dedication always from yours and my own. Super blessed!
yo something flew in my eye
You guys are great. It always clear you just love golf and that you arent in it for the money. So just do not change in that regard. You actually are a part of making Golf cool here in germany, where it always was a more exlusive sport for the elite. And please never start an NFT -Project guys =D
One of the most beautiful family moments I’ve ever seen. Bless you Garrett
Lots of love man, I'm super happy you were able to give back to your family like this. I really enjoy your content. I hope to see more from you soon.
God damn Garrett’s got me cryin in the club right now
Top man great gesture, i’m not crying you’re crying 🥲
Garrett this is an awesome opportunity you had that so many of is dream we could get the chance to do for our parents. Long time GM Golf, Bro 5 and Good Good fan. Great content across all avenues. Congrats again!
<3 <3 <3 <3 < 3 <3
Now Tammy can finally buy a new Pan! She's no longer pissed!
So awesome!!
no way bro garret deserve everything what a grinder fr
Had me bawling my eyes out over here lol. This is workout a doubt, my favorite video of yours.   So genuine, so real, so beautiful.  Congratulations on all your WELL EARNED success and being able to do this, which obviously meant so much to you.  You're a great guy, you're all freaking awesome.  I have so much respect for you and the whole crew.  I found your videos 3 years ago, in the lowest time of my life and you made getting through it so much easier.   You made me more excited about good and made me want to work harder at that.   I still suck, but I'm improving and loving the game more than ever.  Thank you for this video, and sharing this moment.  Love you guys.  Keep being you.
Ugh those onions . From someone watching you 3 years ago . Happy for you !
❤️🙏🏼
God bless you all, after all "Tammy's not gonna be pissed"  I hope i'll be able to do this one day.
Good stuff. Good vibes. Even better people.
Congrats!... on making a grown man cry on his lunch break trying to watch some YT videos.
You’re the man! This is what life is all about!
This is fucking awesome congratulations bro
Well the title should’ve read.. “beware tear jerker”. Absolutely unreal moment to share with everyone man. The example you set on GM Golf and Good Good to people is honestly second to none, and now this! You don’t need flashy things or the best things, you won’t remember those. You remember the memories you make. Not sure much tops this one. Keep it up brother
What the Heck son!? LOL! perfection incarnate
G been watching for a long time man this is amazing congratulations man you deserve every bit of what you’ve accomplished 🤙
Inspiration to many, we love you G-Rat
Shout out to you, G!! You had me over here tearing up like a baby
I'm not crying, your crying! Be proud Garrett! In more ways than one you and the Lads are a credit to your parents and yourselves!
Just so awesome Garrett!! WOW!
Collin behind the camera like 😭🎥
Incredible son and human being...incredible.
Slide them 9k at a time to avoid the gift tax. 🎁
Garrett, you're a genuinely great guy.  Keep up the great work!
Nothing but respect.
Class
Hope I can do the same one day
Sincerely happy for you man
Great job Garrett it's hard to payback what we parents sacrifice for our kids.  I can only hope you continue to be a great kid and don't take your parents for granted...
Who's cutting all these damn onions 😭🤣🤣.
What a legend definitely a tear jerking moment 🙏
The strawbag is getting an upgrade
Tammy is definitely NOT gonna be pissed #pan
Love to see it man never get to big to remember where you came from and keeping the most important people in front of you. your awesome and all the guys that you work love y’all amazing people, amazing content.
Atta boy Mr. Clark
Dang G-Money.....I'm 46 and got tears in my eyes little brother. That's awesome ~
Best on youtube❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
BEAUTIFUL ! aint no shame in letting emotions show !
One of my favorite videos G. Love the raw emotion. You guys have an awesome family, and I'm so glad you were able to do this for them!
God damn wife cutting onions over here making me cry.  Love this for you and your family. 👍🏼
I'm not crying you are 🥺
Garrett the GOAT on Good Good. He’s the reason why a lot of good good guys are doing well and other guys outside of good good doing well.
Dude this is awesome!
Amazing video. Genuine and worth the watch!
This is what success looks like Garrett. You’re doing this thing called life right.
Who’s cutting onions in the comments then. Seriously though that was amazing to watch and I could only dream of doing this one day. ❤️
Well deserved man. You put in the work and things are paying off and you’re doing the right thing by paying back the people that not only raised you but believed in you and provided for you. I’m so happy for you and your parents. I was brought to tears watching this. Keep up the great work brotha. Praise God for his blessings! Looking forward to the content! God bless, G.
You are amazing and u are a very inspirational person I have just started to do some trick starts
Never be ashamed showing emotion man, we’re family here.
100k strawbag incoming . Congrats !
That’s dope man
Material stuff gets old and the newness wears off. Giving back and making memories lasts forever.
People talk about tiger being the goat until they see this guy!
Tammy can get new pans 🤣
Enough to make a grown man cry
Bro this made me get some water works going.... my parents have done the same for myself and my brother. Congrats on the hard work you put in to make this possible!!
As a father I could only hope my son turns out as good hearted and respectful as you young man! All your success is well deserved!
You're a good lad, Garret Clark.  Good on ya for wanting to give back to your parents.  Awe crap.  Got me tearing up, too.
we as children never know how to truly thank our parents for all they do for us... it was good to see the emotions. truly genuine
Truly wonderful! Much love man!
This was amazing to witness. You guys really are great guys.
I heard this stat recently that by the time we move out of our parents houses and move on with our adult lives, we have spent 90% of our parents lives with them.   Gratitude is a beautiful thing. Time is a forgotten virtue with those we love. What a great way to pay them back, but they must be exponentially proud of you and who you are.   Good stuff G.
This is amazing. Something I would love to be able to do one day for my parents.
Great job Garrett.  I'm an older follower of yours (43), and this makes me kinda proud of you buddy.  Keep it up.
Major respect dude
It rhymes with check book 😂
I'm not crying, you're crying!
letsssssss goooooooo
This is awesome Garrett-keep being you man
Wow brother!  Amazing to be in a position to do that!  I hope to be there someday myself.  I think someone is cutting some onions in my office!
Jerry said it best…your changing lives through golf. Congrats to you and team!!
Such a lovely wholesome video, good for you 🎉
Best video I have seen by you! Your such a blessing great job brotha
Who the hell is cutting onions
whos cutting onions rn...😢
Such an inspiration - both you and your parents. Thanks Garret you’re the man.
Might be the greatest YouTube video I’ve ever seen. Every guy growing up wants to have this moment. Wow. Unreal. Props to you for being so generous
This is really cool to see. Just be careful with how you actually give the money to them. Gift tax is a thing. Might be better to give it to them over a couple of years. Talk to an accountant.
My initial first thought was, "damn, they must have won that 100k tourney!" haha love these kinda videos, brings up the good emotions
You’re a good man, G!
That is awesome. Happy for you and all the guys at goodgood. You guys put out great content and help further the enthusiasm for golf. Keep it up…..looks like your community is just going to continue to grow.
Daggom garret!!!! Now I look like a whole ass cry baby here at work ! Congratulations and I’m happy for someone that works so hard can do this for his parents! This is my long life dream and I will fulfill it !
So amazing
You guys were already awesome enough, but now there is this! Mad respect man! You are truly an awesome example for young people to look up to. Thanks for all you do! Good Good best channel on YouTube!
Dude why am I crying?
Congrats garret! I just wanted to say it’s so refreshing to watch this. With all the bad role models and influencers out there that are selfish and aren’t doing things for the right reasons, you are an inspiration. Awesome what you did for your parents and it’s so cool to see. It’s a good lesson that you don’t need all the fancy cars and money to be happy. It’s about good friends and family. Good stuff man
Good for you. I genuinely appreciate the content and vibes. GG
What a guy this. So humble in all that he has achieved.
man that is amazing, so proud of u been watching u for like 4 years now. Such an inspiration garrett, keep it up man <3
I wish you even more success and fortune.  You're a good young man buddy. So proud of you.
Great to see a wholesome video! Good human right there! You’re a great son Garrett!
Truly blessed brother! Such an awesome video! Keep killing it man!
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳. Nice dude
not gonna lie as a fan for the past year and a half to 2 years. i defintiely cried a little bit. So unreal. Congrats on all your success man truly deserving.
What a fine young man you are, more young people should have more respect and love for their parents like you. More good things will happen to you.
Amazing to see your success since high school man.  So glad you’ve come far enough to give back to your family!
Man you guys came a long way. I started following you at 1100 subs.  Hard work dedication pays off.  Keep grinding.

That’s awesome G! For you to keep your parents and family above everything else is awesome to see! Keep it up man.
Best video you've had yet buddy!  So proud of you guys and what you do for the golf community and most importantly what you do for young kids and of course helping out your families along the line.  Congrats!
That's awesome brother!!!
Absolute beast you are bro..... congrats!!
Love it bro, grats on the huge accomplishment!!  Your parents raised you right!!
Respect to my most fav YouTuber of all time 🫡
That’s awesome.   Family is the only thing that truly matters in life! Stayed blessed, bro.
I had to watch this at work and tear up! My boss was concerned lol This is AMAZING!
Whos cutting all these mf onions man 🥲

This is so wholesome ❤️  Congratulations Garrett!

Good for you man!! You and the boys deserve it all. Thanks for the great content.

You’re the man, Garrett! Such a humble, down to earth dude who deserves everything great coming your way! Keep it up!
This is awesome Garrett! I couldn't hold it back watching this either. Such an amazing thing to do!
Great to see, but I hope you talked to an accountant or estate planner before doing this.  That is a lot of money to pay in taxes. Honestly, if anyone reading this ever gets to the point where they can do this please talk to not only your accountant but your parent's as well. There are a lot of variables that go into high value cash gifts that will cause a lot of loss in taxation unless done correctly for both parties.  So happy for all of you guys for getting to this point!  So much hard work and great times to get you here!
This is so wholesome.
I dream of doing this some day
I'm not crying, you're crying....
Congratulations.
Damn bro. Got me cutting onions here. Inspirational stuff!!

I love this man… very inspirational Garrett.
Garrett man, I've never met you and I'm happy crying with you. Unfortunately i don't have a pops anymore and things like this really get me. I have seen countless giveaway videos and don't think I've even been touched like this. Bless your mum too haha, her reaction (timed with yours) is probably the most wholesome thing I'll see all year. Well done G, you're a pretty awesome guy.
It always blows my mind when I think about what Golf does to our lives and our relationships... There is nothing else like it, and it's the most important thing for a young man to be involved in.
Awesome to see.
You choked me up brother ! Wish i coulda done something like that for my parents before they passed ❤
Legit G. Very genuine and you’re a stud. Way to give back.
You deserve every bit of your success. Congratulations!
Beautiful video G!
That is awesome man!

What a great moment between you and your family
Don’t do this to me! I was about to start crying in the middle of class. I’ve always dreamed of the day like this giving back to my parents for all they have done for me through the years. And I’m proud to see you become such a great YouTuber from the beginning of your first channel, I haven’t been a subscriber for a long time but I’ve followed you from pretty much the start.
We love you G, what a gesture ❤️
Great job man
