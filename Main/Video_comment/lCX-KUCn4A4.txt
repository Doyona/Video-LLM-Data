Watching SpaceX's missions never get tiring & old  Been watching you (@SpaceX) since 2017 & still watching to this day  Keep it up SpaceX! 🙌
If you look closely at 17:42  You can see stage 2 at the middle right corner of your screen
COOL
🤗
Why does Starlink have NO customer service? 4 days without internet and no response from Starlink..
Hey Elon, I was in the US Army and would love to be of the first people to put foot on Mars. I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor that was unsuccessfully removed so I do not know how much longer I will be of use to Mankind. I scored so high on the military entrance test and finished in half the allotted time, so they thought I was cheating and made me take it again under close observation. I scored higher the second time and finished even faster. I would only ask two things in return for my service. 1.) Let me get one of your electric cars to use until I leave. (I sold my vehicles so that I don't run anyone over if I pass out from the tumor.) 2.) Build a library and name it after me when I die. EyE SEE YOU ⚡👁⚡
What a era to live!
MVAC’s chillin’
Did some noticed a bird or something flying at high altitude 19:16?
How?? How did they make this happen?
It's always beautiful. I'm so glad
I have to say the launch looked less than nominal but I shouldn't have had any doubt in SpaceX's abilities, as that landing was perfection once again. Awesome live shots to watch.
First Ever Decentralized Orbital Space Internet Data Center ?)))
You can see a satilite during re entry stage

What are the benefits of launching Rockets from the Moon versus Earth?
The footage of the road trip is precious! That's why we all follow you guys. So much hard work and yet so much fun.
chê😒👎
👏
What are price EUR, USD, GBP for one booster asap 1. to build 2. to reuse old one?
Spacex jab logo ko Mars pr le jane lagega tb vo sirf Amir logo ko hi le jayega ya garib logo ko bhi iska laab uthane ka moka bhi milega
wicked you took pan gaming tv's channel
2:43 what's the song
i cant wait until we say “do you remember that dumbass elon musk??” “no.”
Amazinggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
14:42
22:45 landing
Magical.
This video make my moods  👇👇😂 https://youtu.be/RhGfsp2Er9A 😂🐥🐣😂🐥😂🐥🐣😂
Hello Elon Musk, I am a child with an immense desire for you to fulfill my dream. my dream is that you build a ship similar in shape to J2(Jupiter 2) from a Netflix series called Lost In space. You would fulfill a magnificent dream for me. I believe that the shape of the ship is suitable for takeoff on earth as well as for other planets. a greeting  ￼
AirBus could not arrange an air cargo delivery?

Hello Mr. Musk. My name is Tim and I am 14 years old. I think SpaceX's inventions are very cool and I am a big fan of your Falcon 9 missions. My favorite part of all the missions is the Droneship. I think the design is great and the idea of boosters landing safely again is excellent. For this reason, I decided to dedicate the task from math class to the Falcon 9 and the Droneship. We have to create and calculate 3 math questions. However, to make these questions I need some information: How fast (kts) is the Droneship going, how many days before the rocket launch is it going and what is the acceleration (m/s) of the Falcon 9 v1.2? It would be great if you could provide me answers (if possible) to the above questions within the next 2 weeks.  I would greatly appreciate an answer because it would help me get a good grade.  Kind regards, Tim.
What was that object to the left of stage 1? It first appears around timestamp 18:36. It looks like a bird. That couldn't be right at those altitudes - could it?
The launch was so loud, I heard it in my bed two towns over. Thanks SpaceX for the most expensive alarm clock ever! The Central Coast loves ya
Maintaining their 100% land landing record!
After starship is operating will there still be a use for falcon 9, or will she get mothballed?
yet, as humans, we haven't been able to develop a space capable European nation
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates…🟥
Good job guys
SO COOL!!
why flames have changed colour? new fuel formula?
How about a mission to treat your employees with basic human decency
"Space"...haha ...please....come on Elon. 😂😂😂
This will never, ever, get old. Saw the launch from Florida earlier today from the inlet. Awesome stuff.
what is that thing flying around at 18:55
Still never gets old seeing the launch and landing...
T+2:20.  Is that an amended interstage containing the stage 2 engine bell?  I don't remember such a snug and tidy layout with this view.
Several hundreds of thousands, and hundreds of man hours just getting the satellite, to go to space for a few minutes.
Stuff from comic books made real after first being ridiculed and feat being deemed impossible by the "experts" and "gurus"...and then keep being attacked for whatever reason possible. Priceless and never forgotten. A giant among ants.
At 3:54, bottom left corner under the flap, is that space garbage or what is it? Something floating by.
SpaceX y'all rock!
Not even NASA can do this.  Amazing landing feat!
World 🌎 Event Successful
Question,  why no info on the second stage, obviously idiotic machovinist war stuff. Just why?
Starlink made it possible
would be awsome if we could hear some rocket sound? and most importan, where is inspruker. a nominal commentator of note
they are incredible!
😍😍
sussy
https://youtu.be/6WRFxKEDpsE
you should make a drone fleet called The Ronin
I loved that call-out, "mvac is chilling"!
Awesome! Thanks for sharing!
OMG ! I live in Lompoc Ca. it was so loud my shelves were shaking..... I love it! growing up here I have see thousand's of them and I will never get tired of them. great job everyone.
Elon Musk is a boss.
Amazing booster landing view
Браво👍🔊🌐
14:46 - of all the rocket launches I saw over the years this is my first time to see and hear the number and the person doing the countdown in sync. in the past the number was always ahead of the person counting down.
How long does that booster take to full cool after it lands?
SpacEX
These missions are beginning to look routine. And that's the highest praise I know how to give.
So no more weather issues regarding cloud cover!  Awesome.
Good job spacex!
Great..
Gay
125th Successful Return of a Booster.  \o/
Love LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
music at 8:00 on POINT
As many times as I watch these boosters land I'm in awe.Space X is incredible
U.S!A!
Well, that went a bit better than the Astra Tropics mission last week...
Peofoundly dull!
19.25 o que é aquilo? parece saco plástico voando.
Nice transport footage except you left out a state.  Virginia is between Maryland and North Carolina.
real life kerbal
No doubt as to who has the best 'broomsticks' !!!
SO COOL!!!! I loved watching the road trip!!👁🚀🌟🦄🐬 Congrats on the successful move, launch, & landing!!
so cool! song? tnx
Reminds me of that quick landing on the game Lunar Lander that I would attempt when I had just a little fuel left. It never ended well
Wow!  Those engines must be really strong because the liftoff was so quick after ignition.  I all looked flawless.
Best moment of the transportation video - a satellite traveling next to a house on the freeway. Lol
wow
Repent to Jesus Christ  “Praise the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits—” ‭‭Psalms‬ ‭103:2‬ ‭NIV‬‬ H
Landing is always fascinating to watch, cant get enough of it, Godspeed spaceX...✌👍
The launches from Vandenberg are always beautiful, love the fog/clouds.
❤
Can't wait to see Starship Engines start and clear the Tower.
Damn, SpaceX, three launches within one week??
And what, the drone cannot fly closer to the rocket launch site 😂
А что, дрон не может подлететь ближе к месту запуска ракеты 😂
GO SPACEX...OCCUPY MARS NOW!
125.... and another one somewhat later... Crazy but I love it...
Never. Gets. Old.  🚀 ❤ 🚀
I liked the montage celebrating big diesel trucks. 👍
Anyone know what the square object coming off the rocket at 15:13 is?
Elon esta obsesionado en destruir el Mundo SpaceX es todo creado por El Diablo Llamado Elon Musk el es un Verdadero demonio y lo vengo siguiendo desde niños y Te Destruiré Elon Los Destruiré ustedes son Demonios y Lo Mostrare Ante El Mundo
Still no zero point energy….
After watching dozens of these launches and landings, it is still exciting each time.
Back to watch yet another brilliant launch by SpaceX
Please get rid of the annoying techno-pop music during the first 2 min and during the satellite transfer via truck and ship.  There's no need for music.  How about just the sounds of the vehicles ?  If there was a camera there to film it, (or video-record it) then it had a microphone and some means audio-recording.  And for what it's worth, the techno-pop was too loud, compared to the volume of the narrator.
Rockets launching into the mist is so Romantic, if only William Turner could have seen such a thing and painted it.
Kinda sad that we couldn’t stay with second stage however it allowed for greater appreciation of how quickly we could leave the atmosphere and observe the full curvature of the planet.  Space tourism for the masses is perhaps 15 years away (?)
My mission?! Love you SpaceX and NASA
IFR to minimums!
What was those white specs @345 closer to earth??
M-Vac is chillin' 😎  (at 16:34)
Amazing Landing today. With 1 more ignite of stage one to return to the landing zone. Speechless. Congratulations SpaceX.
just a few years ago there were gaps of SEVERAL MONTHS between launches. this year, there's been 1-2 every week!
I don't even watch live anymore these have become so mundane. BRING ON THE STARSHIP LAUNCHES!
Like I’ve said many times, this NEVER gets old! Go SpaceX!! 🇺🇸🖖🏻
ths s aazng
Wow what a landing! I’m using it in my next movie!
Incredible, that the German goverment doesn´t want their spy sats launched by the Russians.
there is no yoo-hoo and clapping?! is this that much of Insignificance?!
What are the 2 things floating by at 18:52??
125 recovered falcon 9’s 🤯🤯🤯
What is stage 1 telemetry relative too? I've noticed the telemetry shows much higher speeds when landing on drone ships as opposed to return to pad.
This is incredible. In that fog they still hit the bullseye perfectly. Always so cool to see.
Absolutely amazing ….  Well done Spacex Team.
So what fell off as it cleared the clouds
I never get tired of watching this
Bundeswehr Aufklärer nun gehts dem Russen an die Wäsche
And their not sharing much technology with Tesla ether
Wonderous!
When is the next one ?
Just another saturday job well done as always
Nor wonder we can't see anything with all the pollution u guize cause!  toxic earth is toxic! :(
Cloudiness is not a problem for the Falcon))) 👏
oh my the deceleration timing for the last 500 meters above ground is really impressive to me
SpaceX be like, give me 10 minutes I'll be back soon. Just have to launch and land a rocket.
cool
"The crowd at SpaceX HQ is, a bit smaller today."
💃🎻🙏🕺🎷🚀 🛰
Huzzah!  Top Notch You'all!
I fully appreciate that the purpose of all this is to deliver payloads to space and you are doing that regularly.  Well done.  But, it is the safe, repeated return of the first stages for  swift re-use which is game changing  Go SpaceX.  (I suspect Musk may be challenging to work for but perhaps his personality issues are largely responsibly for SpaceX?)
Ein guter Tag sowohl für SpaceX als auch für die deutschen Soldaten! 🇩🇪💪🏻
We truly have entered the Space Age.
After watching the other companies struggle I wonder when or if they’ll catch up to SpaceX and what Nasa does if they can’t catch up.  To clarify when I say catch up I mean put astronauts on the ISS and bring them back.
wow! like flipping a candle and landing right side up on a table! NASA why did you not do this?
Azerbayjan 🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
It's crazy that a German military satellite needs to go all the way to the west coast of the U.S. to be launched. Probably some funky 3-way deal between the U.S. and German governments and SpaceX.
Imagine being the person responsible for approving the music that goes into the outro of these videos. Important
🤙
was gonna make the 3 hr drive to watch, but looks like thick fog. Maybe in the winter, with darker sky
WOOOOO -- HOOOOOOO  !!!! TOOK ANOTHER HARD LEFT AT OAKLAND... WOW !!!!  GREAT WORK, KIDS... (Whoever your customer is.... )😶
This is why America is number 1
WOW!!! This was one of the most incredible things I have ever seen. Thank you Elon Musk for making your dream a reality. Without you none of this would exist. You have advanced Space and auto technology by a century within a decade.
At 18:57 - 19:02 there is something in the upper left corner of the screen. What is that?
Congratulations SpaceX
luar biasa spacex, from🇮🇩
🚀🥰🚀🇺🇸🗽🇺🇸
sheesh so foggy
As i see rockets for SpaceX is right now like riding on bicycle ;) good job !
I just *looove* how these launches feel almost casual these days =) Amazing work
No lag anymore, crazy
The idea of a lit horizontal rocket going straight up, as it does briefly during boostback, will always be nuts to me.
Elon is the man!
Falcon 9 booster is IFR rated!  I love watching the liftoffs and landings through the cloud layers and fog.  Awesome!
Bei der Rückkehr derr ersten Stufe, sehe ich immer mehr Grössere Teile durch den Raum fliegen, gerade auch in diesen Video... Ab 18:45 Min wirds interesannt...
3 launches in 48 hours! They keep adding flights, SpaceX is going to need their own 24 hour-a-day launch channel!
The intro would have been more enjoyable without all the irritating visual effects.
18:56... that's not a piece of ice! wtf? lol
Lame sound for takeoff
Brilliant as always...
AYYY the Defender brought her in!!  Representing Delaware!
You kids!  We used to have to wait YEARS between launches and now you can see a company do THREE in one weekend!
never gets old.
Space X is amazing. They are doing more consistent and regular launches than the rest of the world did as a collective 10 and 20 years back.
18:53 What is this object on the bottom screen
https://youtu.be/Shwu-6D5mTQ
Nice launch... and landing as well. But tbh, is it not a better idea for the forseeable future to do launches from the European mainland (Germany for example, where this payload originates from) so one does not have to haul such European payloads for thousands  of miles across the Atlantic Ocean only to have another journey ahead from coast to coast (something about 2500 miles?) This is a costly and logistical nightmare: Launches from the Eurpean continent with Falcon 9  rockets for European based customers simply make way, way more sense. In financial, economical, logistical and security reasons that is. Especially if the number of customers from Europe is going to increase in the future...
Congrats SpaceX and thank you Andy Tran for the entertaining and informative commentary!
Was it not much easier to transport and launch it from Kennedy SC or Cape Canaveral rather than crossing the whole USA in a special vehicle? Anyhow, well done!
it is wild that we get the 1st stage feed uncut these days. SpaceX is so successful that it is even more impressive they don't get complacent and has at least a significant accident while landing.
... 16:45 top left, "Spaceman" cloud formation is a GO
Now with Starlink, the broadcast of the Falcon9 1st stage landing is  simply second to none. Kudos SpaceX!
You wait years for launches and heres two within days.Incredible!
The cadence that SpaceX is doing is simply amazing. Nice video of the satellite's journey from Germany to Baltimore and then across America to Vandenberg AFB.   125 1st stage booster recoveries -you would think after that many people might think of them as nothing. I still love watching the sheer precision of those landings.
Tune in for our 3rd launch in less than 48 hours...wow. Only SpaceX.
Why would anyone else not hire spaceX to deliver their payload and risking an unsuccessful mission?
“At request of the customer” huh? sneaky mofos
What the vision of one man can accomplish . It looks impossible but it actually works
SpaceX makes it look routine, but I still watch every one.  Always a thrill when the booster lands.  Ok, and when the payload makes orbit too. ;-)
I so wish there was a publicly traded part of this company so we could put the World’s financial muscle into Mr. Musk’s exploration of Space.
Looks like they figured out the video interference problems for the booster landing. Never gets old watching this!
Pin point. Congrats team.
cool launch ...great view of the clouds after launch
Lindo
SpaceX missions always successful :)
Great launch. The fog was an awesome special effect. Please do that more often!!!
JESUS CHRIST ALONE DIED FOR YOUR SINS & WAS RESURRECTED FROM THE GRAVE!  HE IS ALIVE & COMING BACK VERY VERY SOON WITH JUDGEMENT (THESE ARE END TIMES)!  PREPARE YOURSELVES, TURN FROM SIN & RUN TO JESUS!    HE KNOWS YOUR PAIN & TROUBLES, HE WANTS TO HEAL & RESTORE YOU!  TALK TO HIM LIKE A BEST FRIEND!  ASK HIM TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU & HELP YOU TO BELIEVE IF YOU DOUBT!  DON'T WAIT TO CRY OUT!  NO ONE IS PROMISED TOMORROW! HE LONGS FOR YOU TO INVITE HIM IN, HE LOVES YOU MORE THAN ANY PERSON EVER COULD, HE CREATED YOU!   Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."-John 14:6  "But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven."-Matthew 10:33  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord”-Romans 6:23
It would be great if you had 2 live streams of your Spacex launches.  One would be with the control room audio only.  Then an educational one where you can talk all you want.  Your  globe shaped timeline does a great job explaining things that the announcer does not need to talk the whole 15 minutes through the launch.   A lot of us have been with you since the first official Spacex launch that you do not need to explain everything away.  If Youtube supports the Audio description feature and you could choose if you wanted to hear the control room audio instead would also  be acceptable.  Your behind the scenes video to day  before the launch was very enjoyable.  Thank you for your hard work.
Awesome!Go SpaceX!
How many successful landings in a row has this been for falcon 9 first stage??
Wow lots of activity.
Wouldn't it be easier and closer to launch from Florida? 🤔
Very pretty footage coming down towards the cloud layer and landing.
3:12 disaster
Parabéns a equipe da spacex, Davi - SP. - Brasil
Did anyone notice some hardware falling right after the boost back shut down?  Thought it was a fairing half for a second…
No employees watching?
Another landing that made me cry. Everything about it, friends. I'm so happy. 🤖🧡
PLEASE bring back the launch microphones! 😮 Rockets Rumble and ROAR, don't you know?   It's not the same without the sound. 🔥🚀
the MVAC is chillin'
Dont see why they don't show second stage
Spacex streams be like:Wow! Rocket get launched! Now spectators, live is over!
You should put a seat with a window for a passenger to ride the first stage.
It would be much more sublime if we had a main narrator without an obvious accent who does not make so many mistakes and use so many non verbals, I don't care who it is as long as we can enjoy a high quality broadcast without uncharacteristic accentual interruptions and having to actively listen and deconstruct, and jettison interruptive verbal noise from what is clearly another language.
WOW!  THANKS
Friday, Saturday and Sunday launches what a weekend.
SpaceX rock(et)s the world!🚀
I’d like to know what all the secrets are about seeing what is deployed. Also, what this stuff is being used for. Its amazing to me that governments have been launching devices into space and generally we don’t question it at all.
18:53 What the hell was that flying by?? How close was that?
Two launches y just days apart! amazing!
Was that an airplane off in the distance (mid to upper left part of the video) at around the 20 min mark?
Nah, we don't do "customer's privacy". 4chan will get us ALL that beautiful private 2nd Stage footage. 😂 🤣 💀
Congratulations SpaceX team, 125  Perfect!
It's cool seeing the Channel Islands from so high above.
Crushing the competition.  Don't teach them the secrets to building your rocket engines Elon.  Stay strong.
Ukraine 🇺🇦♥️♥️♥️
Booster landings still blow my mind, how is this possible? Insane technology. If Elon said I'll land a spaceship in your backyard I'd believe him.
The future has arrived...
Simply out of the world. Amazing! Cheers.
These were the good employees
22:40   landing
damn like clockwork now nice
Ottobrunn - so sad what happened to all the brilliant minds there
"Now, we do have a bit of fog at Vandenberg..." 10:45    We hold these truths to be self evident. :)  BZ on two of three so far this weekend. :)
What was the item appears at 18:52?
thx for launching the german spy sats
I mean this is absolutely incredible…you all are amazing, can’t believe you’ve recovered 125 boosters!
Never gets old!! 😂
As a SoCal person, I am disappointed they didn’t do this in the early evening.  Those backlit launches are so wild to watch.  Oh well, maybe next time.       Edit: Hahaha!  Gawd I’ve become spoiled by SpaceX! Return to launch site was a silly fantasy not that long ago. Now I’m asking, “Could you delay the launch 12 hours so I gather my deck chair?”
Maaann, imagine the pressure on that truck driver's shoulders facing som many hurdles for such a long driving time carrying an important and fragile cargo, he deserves at least an award!
Amazing and exciting! Just a question, why the first stage sometimes land on base and other  time on a drone ship?
looked like the fairing halves going by at 18:30 > 19:00... way cool
You can see the payload fairings Fallon in the background as the grid fins deploy. about 18:40
If the human (sorry dark,  corrupt corporations) is running secret programs of anti gravity propulsion systems this looks beyond obsolete… on the other hand if what has been shared by the pentagon is extraterrestrial in nature this still looks so passé… Mars??? 😂😂😂 can’t make it to the moon… again 😄😄😄
Never gets old!
Can you turn on the subtitles and auto translate? For the rest of the world, thx.
Nailed it! Again! Great job SpaceX… you guys are doing tremendous work!
SpaceX still amazes me with everything they do even after 7 years of reusing Falcon 9 I can’t get over how well they’ve been doing with proving how reusability can be done in rocketry I can’t wait for Starship
Beautiful as always
coo , smooth as butter landing
SpaceX makes launching and landing rockets look so easy. Hats off to all those who do all the hard work to make it look this way!
nice visibility
This doesn't get old! I love watching these boosters return home.
Did anybody noticed something like a celestial being entering the earth's atmosphere a little after 18min of this video?
That journey across the states was impressive. I've not been impeded by a space project on the highways, but did encounter a huge transformer hogging the back roads of Texas. Almost looked like an armadillo inching down the road...the whole road.
Amazing Video spaceX thank you!  Blows my mind how big the Cargo in the Falcon 9 can be. And starships is gonna be even bigger..  Might i ask why the 4 ton Cargo wasnt produced in the USA? Seems like a lot of effort to ship it from germany
In my youth I was enthralled by stories my grandmother told. Born in the late 1800's, she saw so much technological history being made. Born in the early 1950's I now have become my grandmother. My best to you all.
Perfect
BEST OF LAUCH!…👏👏👏👏  OUR EYES ARE ON YOU!…❤️
Beautiful 🥰

SpaceX is in the elite rocket technology class by them selves. 50  years of stagnation over come! Thank You SpaceX!
Bringing the boosters back like the 50's Sci Fi movies and TV shows ! Something I never thought I'd see in my lifetime ! BRAVO !!!!
I love these very long shots taken from the first stage, both going up and coming down! It brings a sense of scale.
Asmelash
When people watch car races, they wait for the crash. When we watch SpaceX launches we want to see success of a landing of stage one and insertion of the cargo into orbit. SpaceX has out performed NASA with every launch
Awesome!!!!!!!!
What was flying back at 18.40 min
Simply stunning
Thanks. :-)
Heck yes!
So cool , SpaceX nailed it again!! Looking forward to FH launch and landing!!!
waw landing in complete fog , nice
Amazing, you folks rock 🤘
NSF channel has the sonic boom sound from this launch if you want to hear it
Great work , thanks !
Great footage!
Love these- I wish the commentator would stop talking over the operations comments.
Wow, that’s really impressive, 25 launches 🚀 so far in 2022
landings are getting too easy for space X..
This is way cool. It only takes minutes to get things into space.
The fog made it less gorgeous than yesterday's launch & landing, but not less fantastic!  Gonna watch tonight's launch if still awake, to make it a three-fer SpaceX weekend!
Man I wish I could see starship launch 🚀 in person,,and F9 is still the best in my book,,go Elon!
MSG US +1 910-408-2650👍✅ For a better understanding, thank you.
Wow, the earth really round 😵‍💫
The road trip was awesome, and landings don't get old, my favorite part for sure
Awesome! I woke up here, 26nm due north from launch site, just in time to catch the return of stage 1! Always an awesome treat....even before my first cup of Joe!
je ne me lasse pas de regarder ça....
German Spy Satellite for even more surveillance. We Germans also care about NATO security. 800 million euros well spent! This sound is the sound of freedom! GO SPACEX! GO SARah-1!
Great job Andy Tran and the entire SpaceX team! It all works just fine even with the fog!
You said you weren't going to show any footage of the second stage, but I saw at least 3 shots of it after separation... Ze customer is not going to be happy :-)
👐
SARah took the ultimate journey before launch.
USA USA
Amazing watched it from 25 miles away no fog  never gets old keep launching from Vandenburg please
this is now like making a sandwich
Launch and land in fog weather is another challenge.Amazed me again.
Amazing at how well each of these are done now.
wonderful satellite transport footage!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂what a load of horse manure
Just caught up with Marcus House channel the tremendous success of SPACEX! Go Elon, Go team 👏🏼 Go for launch! Go Dragon, Go Starship!
So fantastic! 🏆🏆🏆🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥
"and that marks our 125th overall succesful recovery of an orbital class rocket..."  in a handful of years, let that sink in for a moment...
At 18:52 look at the bottom left, it goes off to the side.
Bom dia a todos. From Brasil.
It''s almost getting boring
At 18:30 + What 3 objects were  flying under the left grid fin?
AWESOME🌹🌹🌹🌹
Parabéns.....Mais uma Live Simplesmente Espetacular Magnífica..
I am amazed...Thank you for sharing these moments of history in the making!!! God bless ya'll!!
What was that object flying or passing by the booster? It was around the 4 min mark.
Another nail in their coffins.
Starlink 4-19 and now SARah-1, less than 24h
DEAR EVERYONE AT SPACEX,   GOD BLESS YOU MY FRIENDS.  I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU AND VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.  I HOPE ALL OF YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.  I LOVE YOU.  I LOVE SPACEX.  🙏   GOD BLESS YOU MR. MUSK. I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU AND VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.  I HOPE ALL OF YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE MY FRIEND.  I HOPE YOU HAD THE BEST AND HAPPIEST CHRISTMAS OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.  EVERYTHING HAS BEEN A MIRACLE AND FAR BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS.  EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SUCH A PROFOUND BLESSING! I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL.  I FEEL LIKE CRYING WITH COMPLETE GRATITUDE AND HAPPINESS! I LOVE YOU ELON. I LOVE MR. ESPARZA AND ALL OF MY BEAUTIFUL FRIENDS.  EVERYTHING HAS BEEN FAR BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS AND BEAUTIFUL BEYOND DESCRIPTION! WOW!!!!!!!!!  ( INSPIRATION4 WAS AND IS BEYOND BEAUTIFUL AND BEYOND EXTRAORDINARY)  THANK YOU SO VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH MR. MUSK. 🙏  SINCERELY PETER
damn amazing
How TF did the booster find the LZ? It was invisible under the cloud cover!
Wish I was in Titusville or Cocoa Beach today/tonight. I was there for 2 launches in April and the night launch was one of the best I've seen in years.
Did airbus develop a classified payload ?
With all of these launches and orbital debris, it is necessary to have orbital debris collection/disposal vehicles deployed.
Guys. It's not starship.
wow--- yo Elon musk, now that Amber's out of work, Hollywood does not want a liar, I'm sure Elon can help her out, Elon be careful, just let her go,, use your brains, she will stab you in the back, please keep your lawyer on speed dial !!!!!
Let’s light starships candle next!
Hey, SpaceX!  How about you guys put another camera on Stage 1 that records the "hop" in 4K60 (or even 8K60!) and upload the footage for us to see? The live footage is good but unfortunately so very blurry and only 30fps.  Thanks!
Launch sounds are definitely not as good in Vandenberg broadcasts as they are from Florida.
“M-VAC’s chillin” Nah bro, you’re chillin!😎
go falcon!  Go SARah-1!
Hi. How are you? I know you h ate me!
Today's fact: Strawberries can also be white or yellow, and some can even taste like pineapples.
Great job
Yo
So much better here than NASA TV.
bro just gave us a space vlog
That guy Elon seems to have a good policy of good works due to a Great Crew of employee's and soon will bring folk back to the dinner table. Thank you for showing how cool Technology really is.
19:30 20:17 I'm guessing the moving little white specks are planes far below?
Common SpaceX W
Ein guter Tag für die Soldatinnen sowie Soldaten der Bundeswehr und damit auch ein guter Tag für Deutschland. 🇩🇪
Did anyone else see the multiple satelites and space debris when the part was coming back down? So crazy how fast they move! Great job SpaceX team! When are yall going to start taking photos though?! I want to see this big glowing blue ball from your perspective too!
What was this mission about?
22:27 I'll always be amazed at the stage 1 landing...and btw...  Launching/landing a  rocket?   SpaceX: "Yes, it's a daily routine."
SO COOL!!!! I loved watching the road trip!!👁🚀🌟🦄🐬 Congrats on the successful move, launch, & landing!! 🤩🤩🤩
Elon Musk sucks. Good job firing employees for saying the same thing, too. What an ass.
SN11 vibes🔥
Congratulations again to the SpaceX Team.
This landing was a bit more smooth than previous one.
That was fantastic. Back to back launches...can't wait for another soon.
Falcon in the fog. Sounds like a child tale! Grats on another successful mission!

Sucks that the customer doesn't want us to see the entire mission thru to deployment. Oh well ...
