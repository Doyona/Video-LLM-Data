This turned out great and was fun to watch. What do you do with all of this stuff when you’re done with it? Do you upcycle it into something else? I’m sure storing it takes a lot of room. You should make a village and turn all of these tiny house projects into AirBnB’s and rent them out!

I like how they use the Minecraft mechanics to like putting the sand in your inventory which you don’t even have one just putting in your tshirt
Minecraft took over real life the crafting the blocks the respawn and blocks were floating how

I just realized a door for a human in minecraft is 3 blocks and in the game is 2 blocks then the door you made would fit if you crouch but with a kid it’s just walking in so dose this mean that Minecraft’s characters are kids?

You should make a video about staying in the Minecraft house for twenty four hours
Awesome
I wish someone would fund these people so they can do this again but with actual 1 meter cubes!
The blocks are kind’ve small making not too functional but just the quality of the blocks makes up for it and more. I would be so happy to have this when I was 10 because then I would be the perfect size to walk in and have fun!

you should spend the night in there for a challenge but there would be obstacles in order for you to actually make it to the house to spend the night in it.
Shouod try to make a bigger minecraft house or make something like a castle or something. Wouod be cool to see what yous make

Hey dangie bros this is a great video I love the house but I relies after watching the vid you didn't do an overnight challenge but that's ok. Anyway I have ideas for 4 overnight challenges 1 a minecraft village with your teem being mobs and villagers 2 bikini bottom 3 clash of clans village 4th and final one has to be my favorite how to train your dragon and if you were to only do one of these please do the 4th one

In reality you are absolutely different from that image of yourselves that you have created in your external consciousness. And your might is unlimited. The potential to be God is laid within you, within each of you. As a matter of fact, you are gods. And your task is to master your divinity little by little, to let the divinity enter your external consciousness.

Are you ready for Heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty. But wait, God loves you, he made a way out. God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Please think about it. Repent/believe before the rapture, before the one world government. Jesus died for you,live for him. Love U

I have only a minor complaint, and that is that Minecraft blocks are 1 meter cubes, so unless you guys are 9 ft tall you mixed them up with terraria blocks which are 2 ft squares.
I’m not a floppa

Baby, adorable, house awesome, smile on my face + 10 for adding the cutie pie

Chris.Jeff if you even throw a sock over my side of the room I am kicking you out.Jeff threw the shoe
This was cool but I have an idea for y’all you should do an overnight in the Minecraft house
According to minecraft block science  That means chris and jeff are 3 metres tall And the chest is blocks long

Hi
This is sooooooo sick
10/10
Actually, a Minecraft block is 1 meter by 1 meter by 1 meter. So 2 blocks should be bigger than you.
Dude this is sick!
So envious of this...
love how it's in real size (3 ft)!
Hi
Jeff can you make a video about 24hours in the minecraft house
These videos are so impressive, keep working hard guys!
1000 /10
I got reminded of gathering mats in fortnite when they mined and chopped
I can already tell they will do an overnight challenge with the house
I Love it
what happen to rob
You need to do an overnight in this house
Craftmine
This is probably the earliest ive ever been😂❤
Hey Chris and Jeff do a 24hr in it if y’all didn’t tear it down at the end or you could do 1 to 1000 dollar Minecraft house and then 24 hr in it
Alternative title: We got a 1 Billion $ Nasa supercomputer and downloaded extreme shaders and RTX in minecraft.
very epic
I really love how the house looks, so I'm going to rate your Minecraft house 100/10 💎 .
You should do an overnight challenge in the minecraft house

that editing was incredible
I’m impressed by the quality of their blocks. Usually, when I see YouTubers use Minecraft blocks they aren’t made of an actual wood
Best video ever I don’t know what will impress them wife’s
