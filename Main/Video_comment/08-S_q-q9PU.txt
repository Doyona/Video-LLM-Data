Grey guy is human punch bag lol
Of course skye is there watching bae lol
Stop bullying your employees, Mr Hills. I know you think you're a iceman, but really just a lanky bully
They look like they had fun tbf.
who's here after him and devin haney was having a heated conversation😂
I heard he use to box in the amateurs , this what I like to see , definitely wanted my respect 🫡
Eddie vs jake paul is 50/50
Leonard Ellerbe would get dominated by Eddie Hearn
6 and 0 Eddie Hearn
Lol they both got twice the heart of a.j
“No touching of the hair or face” 😂
Under estimated him
Eddie taking it too serious
Eddie Hearn fights 4ft man with pony tail
Eddie is advage no more
This is what we called going body
The iceman from Billaricay 6 n 0 by way off
For those who didn’t know Eddie Hearn used to be decent amateur as a kid. Good to see he still got it.
Ha! I can't believe this. I always liked Eddie now I like him more. He has more technique than some of today's current heavyweights that rank 30-50 in the world, LOL.
Nothing but love for the guy 🥊💪
Now we know the real reason why Tyson Fury retired
Haha, I like how Eddie Hearn is a better boxer then 95% of MMA fighters
Are Eddie and Frank meant to be friends? lmao..... Eddie was brutal lol...... loved it.....
this session all went down to who's more in shape and who's more experienced.
"brutal" sparring session? it was clearly body sparring only... idk if it's just for the sake of politics in propaganda boxing news for the sake of clicks but if not the person who uploaded this doesn't know a thing about boxing
Scouring all the comments to find the time stamp and can't see one 🤨. "Fine I'll do it myself.." 2:38
I think Eddie Hearn beats Jake Paul lol
Where’s Bob arum?
That a workout not fighting anyways great see he not a chicken sandwich
lol Eddie Hearn is actually better than 99 percent of the jerry picked opponents of Jake Paul. That is saying something.
Whoever labeled this brutal sparring obviously he’s never been sparring brutally this shit is Cupcakin
Throws more than deji
I love how at the start it looked like a mess about but come round 3 the look of concentration on their faces lol
Put head gear on this body stuff is weak
Hat’s off to Eddie the teddy and ferocious frank 🥊
Eddie vs Kell Brook at catchweight would be a seller. After their last wins they deserve a big pay day
What tracksuit is Eddie wearing anyone?
Surprised the WBC didn't make a belt for this...
Ellerbe vs Hearn. Now thats a non-boxer boxing match we would all pay to see. Hearn could even get away with a DAZN PPV on that one🤣
Smith should be ashamed of his physique and lack of fitness.
They body boxing
Fair play. Respect that.
Wtf was that my son9and could do better really 😂🤣
Eddie lookin like error spence in there loool
Fast Car vs Fish Eyes is pay-per-view
Eddie vs Leonard! Let's go!

Hearn vs Fury 2023!
😂😂😂😂, eddy one punch 👊, ....
Canelo haters be like he’s ducking Eddie
I'd pay good money to see Eddie do one of these with Frank.
Forget Fury vs Whyte, I wanna see Hearn vs Leonard Ellerbe! 🥊🥊🔥🔥🔥🔥
If they had headgear I wonder how Eddie's jab would have been
There's not a promoter in the world eddie wouldn't hold his own with
Yes Eddie 💪🏽
Eddie vs khugan
Eddie the teddy , possibly the best name ever
I like Eddie Hearn’s way of giving out a corrective action.
Eddie Vs Dana white
Yeahh Eddie clearly better than Frank but it doesn't take much to smash a fat pussy
I think Eddie’s wants an exhibition fight. He’s always dropping hints when he’s around Jake paul.
Frank is a tub o lard lol
Eddie be promoting himself soon 🤣😭
Americans watching this like wtaf.
Gotta love Eddie and frank
Eddie hearn vs leonard ellerbe😂😎
Hearn vs Haymon

Why are we watching two businessmen spar when there's two world class boxers fighting at the weekend?
Leonard Ellerbe shitting his pants now isn't he
I knew there was something missing, they are not punching the head. Still decent from EH.
I think Eddie is training with Canelo
Imagine eddie is more of a fighting man than that bully john fury
We need Eddie Hearn vs Frank Warren
Yes Eddie!!! He's always said he can't box.  Somebody been telling fibs!
Ellerbe would get smoked
So it was no faces allowed...for f**k sake....leave it alone...boxing is the laughing stock of the sporting world has it is.
Poor ol fat  frank
Eddie "The Body Snatcher" Hearn
Eddie has more skills than AJ and Whyte combined.
WE WANT EDDIE v ELLERBE ON A CARD ASAP
Now let's do Eddy vs Frank Warren
Walking the talk and that's why he pays his fighters well for taking the walk
if uysk gives up the belts or becomes undisputed champ in reccess then as mandatory challenger to uysk aj will be able to fight for the undisputed titles again against the wbc champ..only fair isnt it? i cannot see uysk being able to defend his titles when his country is at war and will need rebuilt again..i doubt we see uysk or loma in a ring for the next 2 years at least..
Quality
Tbf Eddie has a bit of pop and speed
Eddie you got bow legs, been hanging around Kugan too much

Eddie gonna want to talk about fighter pay after this 😆 🤣
Eddie hearn would mash up these youtube guys.🤣
Worlds not ready for eddie !
Got some venom in him as well.. lol. Was good to see..
People refuse to love the fella because he's a wealthy boxing promoter who's "SUPPOSED" to be slimy and untrustworthy.. He's not.. He comes across as honest as he can be at most times I've seen him..  I've always liked how this man came across.. Learned from his Dad and took it to another level without being cnut like those of the former generation.  I think the man is genuine..
Go on Eddie 👌🏻🤣
Frank at a disadvantage not being able to throw the overhand right
Eddie weight bullying like Haney
Obviously he's picked alot up over the years was impressed with hern their ♥️
Ben Davison has let himself go
Eddie vs Fish Eyes next
Go on Eddie Hills
True story Barry threw him in when he was younger but had to change his name to Eddie hills because everyone wanted to KO him. But credit to Eddie he done well 4-0 was he’s record
Fair play to both. Smith enjoying a few too many huge lunches, but that blonde pam tree..... Nooooooooo
After seeing their most recent performances... Eddie could take Okolies belt off him at a packed out Wembley arena.. Then Lawrence should go join the wwe..
Eddie hills the Ice man 4-0.. 3 by the way of.  You never know now you have fucked dazn up and sky don’t want you I reckon fish eyes 👀 might give you a contract ??
I'd love to spar Eddie
We want Eddie vs Leanord Ellerbe
Leonard Ellerbe would be knocked out
Eddie Hearn vs Canelo Álvarez ( let's make it happen ) 🔥🔥🔥

The big public school boy has got good hands 😮😂
Eddie vs Adam Smith would be funny 😂
Heard Canelo using him for sparing in his upcoming fight, just a rumour, just a rumour!
Yooooooo Eddie is kinda nice with the hands 🤣🤣🤣
To be fair Frank'd had just had his breakfast!
The Ugkin Brutality here is Brutally brutal that's the Brutally honest truth! Acehole
I reckon Eddie beats 95% of YouTube clowns
Eddie's really trying hard 😆 frank is like a fat girl 🙈
Eddie would have Molina innit 🤣

Frank such a fat boy now 😂😂
Yes guys!!!
Go on Ed
We need eddie hearn vs frank warren. Vince mcmahon as ref
Frank's obviously had some training since there last encounter but you can tell he's never boxed.  Eddie is actually OK, should have a fight, I'd give him a chance against some of the white collar fighters 😀
Hearn Vs Warren
Let’s not forget Eddie down a lil amateur boxing as a kid😅. Looks good and healthy
Eddie Hearn was a amateur boxer.. he can fight
Eddie The Hitman Hearn! I'm impressed
Eddie Hearn looking slicker than Campbell Hatton
Quality stuff 😂
Go on lads. Don’t forget Ed used to box as a lad so will have some skills as shown here.
Told use a can scrap
Head gear on with some large gloves and then include head shots
Eddie got skills
Good Sparring for the Leonard Ellerbe fight  !!!
This is brilliant
Cmon Eddie, why did you choose to spar Sponge Bob, when you cldve sparred someone with a bit more grit and reach. Just saying mate, his midriff was screaming "hit me"!! 🤣🤐😇
Eddie should fight one of these youtubers he would makes 100s of millions and it would be fun to watch :D
Wow! He ain't too bad!👏🏿 Eddie Hearn, could probably knock out 90% of the people who talk shit about him?!😂🤣🥊
Frank Warren would smash both of you up 😂
Hearn in training for the Jake Paul fight
Eddie has watched thousands of hours of boxing i guess IT helps a little
This gives me bubble vibes. We need bubble trouble back.
Hills now 5 & 0.
To be Fair Warren verses Arum was a better match up
Still better than Bellew v Cleverly 2.
The fat kid in grey got battered in the ring and in the showers after
Think how much money we'd get for fisheyes vs golden bollocks? Eddie did that 😂
I want him against Ben Shalom
This is shit
All jokes aside you can tell Eddie boxed before. He looks write decent and would beat some of the journeyman out there.

another youtube boxer in the making
Bro Eddie Hearn can beat the breaks off  Blueface easily.
Gotta respect Eddie proper down to earth guy not  always serious 💪🏽💪🏽
Fair play to eddie lol
This is actually better than the okolie fight, and eddie can box, but we knew that anyway.   Good stuff
Brutal???? About as brutal as a Teddy bears picnic
Thought Eddie was beating up a girl to start with.
Ellerbe don’t want that SMOKE 💨👊🏾🔥💪🏾🥊
Go on Eddie!!! Loving the mean streak 👏🏿
Hearn v Jake Paul - 23rd July 2022
Title of this should be "Physically over matched employee gets beaten up by bully boss"
Eddie 2 Frank Smith 0
Well done lads!  Frank - too many beers son!  ;-)
Would rather of seen him and his fighter turn up for the press conference for one of the biggest fights in UK history that apparently they are a part of. Very bitter, very bad for boxing
Hilarious 😂
At first, I read Frank Warren. I was like, man. I would've paid for that shit. Fixing shit the old school. They can still make it for the Canelo undercard.
Eddie using his purse loss energy
Why drop this gem at 4am ffs. Smithy boy clinching more than okolie
Hearn would destroy ellerbe
Eddie vs Freddie Flintoff , my money would be on Eddie after watching that 😂
Pathetic
Surprised they never PPV it 😂😂
Eddie smashing the body after all the times Fat frank's fucked up in work 😂😂😂
Eddie Hearn vs Dana White Lets gooooo
Eddie had a little bit of spite in his face in this, probably imagining he’s beating up Usyk or Fury
Lmao@Eddie 'The Teddy' Hearn
Anyone else remember Frank smith before he was fat and bitter
Eddie hitman hearn. The body snatcher
😂👏🏻 lowblow that ref!!!
😂😂
Eddie can have a fight deffo 👌
Look at all Eddie's yes men.
If your no fighting usyk I will.
Eddie has boxed as a Ameture, this Frank needs a punch in the mouth. Eddie should learn that Frank's are not good for him.
now do canelo
Vicky Pollard had no chance
Yes Ed lol.. didn't he have a couple amateur fights?? I'm sure i heard either him or his Dad say that in an interview...
Fair play to Eddie Hearn , well done 👍
Eddie Hearn v Ben shalom next for the sky PPV cup
Eddie always was better at promoting himself than his boxers
I legit thought Eddie was beating a female up until about a minute in.
Eddie Hearn Vs Lenard Ellerbe on the Canelo Vs Bivol undercard please
Snr will be so disappointed
Frank looking like a fat sonny Edwards 🤣🤣🤣
2:26 Eddie ‘faster hands than Amir Khan’ Hearn
Eddie have this as a 50/50?
How is Frank Smith in such poor physical shape? You work in the boxing industry and your father in law is Chris Eubank, you should be inspired to get in shape I would have thought. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Get Eddie onto a celebrity card! Some good shots there 😂😂😂
I had frank 3 rounds to 0 … oh wait no I’m not the bbboc 🤣🤣
The Billericay ice man...haha
Well done Eddie
eddie vs jake paul when?
I’ve seen worse heavyweights on Eddie’s shows
They should put head guards on and go full sparing
Literally thought Frank was a woman at first
Better than Klitschko v Fury.
Ellerbe ducking that smoke from Eddie right hand man hearn
What a plonker
Fp Eddie 👍👍👍
Judges Unanimous decision W for frank
Looks like lil evil Eddie has had enough of AJ and Dillian Whyte and will take Tyson on himself ? Or is he showing AJ how to deal with a lil fat man
Frank looks like a fat lessa tryna lose weight
Sparring with t shirts on?
It's obvious Frank is scared to punch the boss
this is nothing, when Dana was younger he would beat Tito in boxing every time they would spar.
Three by way of...
Eddie looked pretty relaxed in there, some decent foot movement and targeted the body  Not bad
Didn't Eddie start off as a boxer I'm sure he had a few fights
We have to see Eddie’s legendary movement vs Bob Arums heavy hands 🔥🔥
Eddie vs Big John fury great match for charity
😂
🤣
thats more entrtaining than lauwrence okolie.
Omg! Eddie got some skills.
Unbelievable content
That's excellent to see.  I reckon if Eddie sticks at it,  he doesn't have to do head sparring just body and shoulder sparring,  I reckon in 12 months his fitness will shoot through the roof and he'll probably have pretty good form.
Frank's a bum
Eddie can throw hands fair play 🤣😬🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Superb!!👊🏻💥
Eddie can fight, it’s hard for a tall guy to body spar a much shorter guy. Personally I think Frank shouldn’t used that opportunity to land a big shot up top and inherit the boxing empire now 😜
Sam’s out of shape
111-114 smith
Bet the judges still scored it wrong
Eddie the teddy ❤💙💚💛💜
How was this not PPV?
Eddie’s 40ys so fair play. But Frank looks like a Karen aged 35 who shops at Waitrose
What's with the man bun Frank the tank? :)))
New lows for the matchroom boys . Making tea to taking a beating .  Eddie Vs Warren 5 . 3 second rounds ppv
Eddie i have to take my hat off to you, fairplay  geezer lol.
😂😂😹😹
Why is this so funny? 😂😂😂
Frank 114-111
Don’t talk the talk if you can’t walk the walk. Eddie showing he can do both  🤴
Ben Davison needs to get his shit together ha ha
The 4 and 0 iceman from Billericay.
Get Leonard Ellerbe on the fackin blower Eddie after this spar
This is fkin hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cheeky Eddie, looked like he had bag gloves on😅🤣😅🤣👍👍🥊🥊
Eddie is a beast🤣 don't let the silver spoon fool you😅
Ellerbes nostrils are flapping like mad 😂 he wants no part of hearns
Eubanks sister will drop Frank smith too
Where is Sugar Ray Leonard Ellerbe?
Fast car is a different weight class to frank 😂😂😂🥊🥊🥊🥊
Exactly what AJ needed to do against Usyk. Close him down and work the body. Might need to hire Eddie now.
Not fucking bad!!! Best promoter in the world
Eddie Hills the Beast of Billericay
Frank needs to loose that timber
Like a couple of irons
The money frank smith must have and he still gets his bird to cut his hair sort it out frank
No head shots. Was that the agreement?
🤣🤣🤣🤣 holy crap, until end of round one, I actually thought eddie was sparring a woman. Note to self, read thumbnail correctly in future
HR will have to get involved for this work place bullying ;)  This isnt the first time Eddie's dropped Frank with a body shot either
Eddie getting ready for Leonard Ellerby. Get him Eddie.
Eddie got some moves
Leonard Ellerbe should give this a watch
Love it Eddie & Frank nice job guys. Respect to both of you.
Haha look now eddie earn doing a jake paul show trying to get a PPV fight .. there all just show men  PPV PPV PPV that's all it's about  Ok its entertainment but really 🤣🤳

Eddie looks half decent to be fair
much respect to Eddie, nice hands and nice pivot.
Fight of the year contender most def!😂
Frank smith looks like a woman
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 really enjoyed that 😂
10 ounce gloves no one's getting knocked out 🤣
Haha...beating up the waterboy...
Can't think why DAZN are losing £1b a year with content like this.  A workout spar as 'content' 🤣 gotta be worth the £10.90 subscription
Anyone else notice that Eddie had on bag gloves and Frank smith had sparring gloves 😂 so every shot Eddie threw would have hurt more
Eddie boxed when he was in his teens I believe, not bad I was expecting it to be an complete mess 😂
Eddie vs Kugan is the spar that everyone needs to see
Big respect for Eddie!!! Not a bad fighter also!!
Eddie vs Kugan next.
Eddie Burrrrrrrrrrrn really burned himself out this time:-))
This should be PPV.😂👍
Frank Warren don't want none of that smoke from Edward Hearn impressive 🥊
Eddies had a few fights back in the day, he used to use a different name so nobody new who his dad was.
If you're still with DZN you got charged £10.99 for this
was there a rematch clause if eddie lost ? lol
Frank Smith have a rematch clause right?
Respect to Eddie and frank!! Top guys
Leonard Ellerbe has been real quiet ever since this vid dropped 👀
Go Eddie 😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Eddie could have been a good boxer if he wanted to, u can do he’s been keeping in shape
Eddie vs John Fury on PPV next
Frank hugging like  okolie at the weekend and kugan will be gutted it’s not on ifl
Hearn vs ellerbe make it happen
Don't forget that eddie hearn was an amateur boxer
Kugan next for eddie the burn 🔥 hearn.
ayo, eddie even knows how to cut off the ring! 😂😂
Over hand right from frank would have slept Eddie
The tits, the hair, the belly…Frank really is a fine figure of a man.
Eddie Hearn might become the next greatest heavyweight boxer of all time😂🤣
I thought it was Shannon Courtney at first 😂
Leonard Elebe already Shaking like booty meat in his boots 😂😂
Anyone else think that eddie was beating up a girl for 3 minutes ?
Get that blob on a treadmill
I bet Leonard Ellerbe is trying to delete that "I'll smack the sh*& out of you"  tweet.
Eddie better than some of jake Paul's opposition
How dare Eddie try to steal the shine from Fury’s press conference by holding a spar against the guy who unplugs old Bazza’s toilets.
Eddie is actually half decent haha. Never thought I’d see this, we need Eddie vs Kugan!
So for all the non-AJ, Whyte, Matchroom, Hearn folks….here’s some angles for ya:  Frank with the manbun haha ha Eddie taking out his rage at losing purse bids haha ha About as exciting as AJ v Parker haha ha Get the teas in Frank haha ha. And I’m sure y’all will have many many many many more zzzzzzzzzz 🙄🥱😴
@1:16 Eddie picked up a trick or two being around Canelo 😨
Eddie "3 fights away from AJ" Hearn
Eddie didn’t look bad at all, good breathing, good stance, catchin and shootin, used footwork to evade off a clinch, and he did a combination and actually pivoted in his shadow boxing 👀
Eddie is very good.
Eddie Hills the 5-0 Iceman 👊
This is fucking brilliant!!! Eddie v Frank W. PPV. Any amount of money. COME ON!!!!
I bet there is a Rematch clause !!!
I reckon Eddie had a 6 month camp and Frank was last minute opponent
Suprised Dean Lemar Hearn hasnt turned up and physically restrained these two
Who is it grants fight fans wishes and throws body punches vicious all without a hair out of place would of broke Ellerbe's face ... There's only ONE Eddie Hearn!
Eddie Hills sparring in preparation for his comeback 🥊
Fatty ellerbe doesn’t want this smoke
Fantastic body shot from Head Buster Eddie……🥊🥊💯❤️
Gender neutral boxing?;)
Frank's gone up a.weight aint he?;)
I've heard Eddie loves camp and regularly gets  battered around the ring:)
Not going to cut it against the Warren shoulder roll.
Next Hearn vs Ruiz jr.
Whos the saucy mare shouting "finish him, Eddie" after he dropped that punk?
Eddie Hearn vs Dana White, make it happen.
Eddie the BODY SNATCHER GOD DAMN!!
Hearn vs Ellerbe
Fat Frank with the spots has put on another 3 stone and had a sex change. I thought he'd been quiet.
Leonard Ellerbe has been real quiet since this video dropped
Ellerbe 👃 🦆🦆 eddie hearn
