"When I was up, I couldn't breathe, I had these n*ggers in my space When I was down, I looked around and none of them was in my face"  BEST part of the track. Snakes only there to take from you, real ones are there til the end through the highs and the lows.
Trenches......... Im in a worren... R.i.p warren i didnt mean to hit that hard!  Caught a body. Brought a bottle of glens voddy..... Il leave you hearing bells..constantly like noddy..... 5 foot nothing. I got nothing. Never had nothing.  Il turn nothing into something. Il make something flip.... If its a pack or a pack of opps. Il go shop in flip flops and still bang out.  Leave me out. Or ill pick something out and leave hime stretched

He ain’t the next Pop Smoke, he’s the one and only AbraCadabra
People out here fighting over accomplishments other people did, and who did it first... like does it really matter, I like abra, I like pop and do they sound similar? Yes. Does it matter who did it first? No, just listen to the music, don't ruin it with childish fights over such stupid things.  They made it, both of them, through struggle. Dont belittle their success with this bullshit. Listen to what you like.  RIP The Woo tho.

JESUS LOVES YOU...YOU MAY FEEL ALONE BUT JESUS IS WITH YOU ... TRY AND TALK TO HIM CONFINE IN HIM   THANK YOUhttps://youtu.be/6IawlQKMepohttps://youtu.be/AtBNTF90X08https://youtu.be/UVmu-Aln2Xo
LIFE ISNT EASY .... I don't want to force anything on yall but man I've had so many problems and the only true way to come out of them victorious is thru the Lord God Almighty... I know society makes everyone think being religious is for deluded people but please open your eyes it's not..  I plead to yall just say a prayer to God commit all your worries fears, regrets and deepest problems into his hands.. read the bible and keep praying to him in Jesus Name .. I promise you your life will change for the better I promise you  I was pondering on suicide, I wanted to run away from home but I prayed to the Lord God and all of a sudden ..things started moving forward in my life.. I've done so many evil things in my past.. things that i think any other person would kill me for if they were God but God kept me alive and well  I dont want to be seen as the deluded guy in the comment section but I'm literally pouring my heart out  I thought my sins were too bad and that I will never succeed in my dreams.. but I forgot that in John 3:16 it says "For God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life"  Believe that Jesus died on the cross for all of our sins to be forgiven and to give us eternal life in heaven You may think I'm crazy but I'm begging just try this read the bible pray and watch yourself rise to heights you never expected   Dont fall into the tricks of the world I'm begging  I apologise for this being too long  Imma try and send this out to loads of comments sections.. I hope this touched your soul.. if it did please like the message and comment  let's make it togetherhttps://youtu.be/6IawlQKMepohttps://youtu.be/AtBNTF90X08https://youtu.be/UVmu-Aln2Xo
Not a regular driller any more , my guy touching souls now 💙 🙏
Man like ab
This one wasn’t my favourite at all n I don’t think anyone else really rated it but I can appreciate that he’s tryna a new ting👏🏾👏🏾 it was a deeper one still RIP to all the fallen soldiers😔😔

I REALLY hope this bredda has smart people around him. Because he's stepping up now, don't fuck up the bag.
Man basically took the chorus melody from emotionally scarred but other than that this tune is 1 of his waviest since the roads. 🔛🔝
He stole the emotionally scared from lil baby on the hook, he did it just a bit slower
Tuneeeeeeee !
Abz is mad talented 🥶🥶🥶💥💥
I found it hard to tell between the realest and the fake, When I was up i couldn’t breed I had these niggas in my space!!! !!!!!! Easy!!!! No problem no problem!! 🔥🔥🔥
I think the singing thing suits him way better than rapping. He is still a mad rapper though.
Nuttin but respect for da work rate

Imagine Abra ft Travis Scott 🙏🏽

Love it when Abra goes in his zone with these ones u already know he's got flows so when he makes something slower it hits different 🙏🙏🙏
No problem no problem is the only thing I am recognising now , what style is this 😂
Not to shore on his new style he changed his voice a bit when he raps
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

Not gonna lie, this is pretty shit, Abra used to be good
okey, fellows. here you go: 1. go to the Tе-lеg-ram.. 2. search for the chan-nel "Walter CoinCoin". 3. learn how to start copying transactions automatically. 4. switch on copuing the deals. 5. Lots of money! Don't thank.
This is wavey wtf
Sounds like Emotionally Scarred abit
Auto tune was dreadful... it killed this for me
Two Faced - released this track not sure who's version i prefer both are fire - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suAQAjcirL8
For everyone who replied to my comment on his fitb& said he cant sing, think again 💯💯
https://youtu.be/ZXoyZx38MPE
Crap.. listen to the Beatles rap gives me headaches.
No Problem, No Problem

Watching him come up from being around headie to him actually working on himself and doing mad bits independently gotta rate it 👏🏿

This sounds like lil baby- all in
My video (BigPock - Trenches 2.0) is out in a couple days 👀🔥🔥🔥
My ting called trenches aswell 👀🔥🔥🔥
Obsessed with this one ❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
JESUS IS COMING SO SO SOON Y’ALL! Repent and trust in Jesus alone! Lemme know how I can pray for you :)  God created the world good and perfect, but we as humans have rebelled against that by sinning. Every single one of us has sinned. And just like on earth te here’s punishment for breaking the law, so there’s punishment for breaking God’s law: death and eternal separation in hell. BUT HERE’S THE GOOD NEWS: out of God’s deep and unconditional love for us, He sent His one and only son to take that punishment. Jesus is eternal and never committed any sin, He is 100% God and 100% man, and He just loves you ever so much. He paid the price IN FULL for our sins, so that we don’t have to. We owed a debt to God and Jesus paid it. And He rose 3 days later proving His sacrifice was accepted. Now all you have to do, is repent and trust in Jesus alone!   God is so good! He has pulled me out of the darkest place, and sharing the good news of the Gospel is in the hopes that He can help someone else too :)
Are you in history class
Uk Pop smoke🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is shit

Bro abra is fucking really grinding this year it’s mad💯🔥
people who saying he is UK Pop Smoke......bro, Pop Smoke is US Abra.....Abra is doing this for years now...not trying to disrespect Pop, but ...
this man gonna be pop smoke replacement and im here for it!
This whole fucken tape slapped so hard .
i think we should stop judging the people that think abra got inspired by pop, yes they are wrong but they are still getting abra more views, we should just ignore them and let them think he is the new pop smoke cus then more views for abra then later on they can find out themselves, that he inspired pop but by then hes gonna be the new wave fr fr.
