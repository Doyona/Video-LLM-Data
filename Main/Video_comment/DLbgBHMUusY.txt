under 6 minutes is just crazy
them olives nasty
Sponsored by honey looks so weird after knowing the reality of honey now 😭
Yoo drop the metal music in description
Almost 7 minutes in and I can’t even count the amount of ads, product placements and drops. And then we get to the challenge. This is the last one for me, Godspeed
Not the Honey sponsor.
Anyone in 2025?
What is the toppings on his pizza called
eating starts at 6:54
Matt beats this challenge in 2030 in 3 minutes.  Matt: 2020... EAT IT!
wow just wow
Hi          I have zero likes and how did I know Idk😅
i am hungry
2024 anyone here
Amazing thy are still in buisness with free pizza for one year. lol I would of lived off that shit honestly
its crazy how this man is not gaining weight after all the amoun of food he has been eating 😰☠
What about eat slowly its much more healthy and u aøcan enjoy the pizza to...
I hope he doesn't have a heart attack!
SJ represent
Think your math is off Matt, 1 pound is 16 ounces, not 12.
Im moving here
ale minero el mejor 🧑🏻👌🏻👏🏻
Holy fk. I just watched the old video first, saw the end and was like, "SIX MINUTES?!" Watching THIS now, omg.
Eating a pizza with black olives, of all toppings, is my version of hell, so extra props. I have no idea how people willingly eat pizza with black olives on top and enjoy it
Some of the worst looking pizza I’ve ever seen. That’s like Arby’s level pizza Jesus …..
8:07 go go go go go xd
To be fair if your younger self knew the time limit was 18 minutes as apposed to an hour, he might've gone even quicker lol
Just watching  this video ,  first  of  all none those  pizzas  weighed  near  6 lbs ,  because you weighed them in box ,  they all had be taken out box then weighed separately on scale  ,   Weight  of  box  throws  off there actual weight .
You can EAT my gosh
That's insane....unbelievable.
That’s too much but it’s your content.
Bro beat his previous time by 12 minutes... this man deserves a sub.
You can imagine his performance in  deepthroat scene 🎬 😂
video fast fordword 😂😂😂
Olive, mushroom, (and I love sausage! with these... My favorite pizza...of course with some soda and plenty of the *wink* (Whiskey/Vodka/Gin and what ever is available) makes it all the the better... Thanks awesome!!!
Matt Stone bullying his past self be like:
Dude bro 😎 you demolished old time
6 Minutes wow well Done
Things change. Advertising is constant.
How The Bible led me to Islam https://youtu.be/aFMHH9Hp-OM
should of did 4:35. you ate half of it at 1:38. but thats still fast af. good job man.
Good luck on that
Anyone else get future trunks vibes with this Matt stonie arc?
Ninportawak  franchement
free pizza for a year????? no wonder they out of business
bros hacking
It's insane to think that your first challenge was on my birthday.
6:00
Back then the dough was thick af, nowadys it's thin.
Dude I freaking love the ultra man little them shot ,infact if that's what you were going for
Ag5egu 567 :7&&+
Проста санітарна чиста. Акула "прибрала" сміття з моря.
one slice of pizza destroyed in under 15 seconds... that alone has to be some kind of world record
He beat three times
matt stonie is the reason you shouldnt do food challenges in your restaurant, unless you want to go bankrupt
With a throat like that. . .
7:27  that sound
Do you still have the belly shirt?
I NEED 3 MINUTES FOR A SLICE
Yeah, pizza party went out of business for giving free pizza away for people who destroyed that challenge😂
I wonder if he ate all three them pizzas
So sad that the pizza party shop went out of business
Alex😊😊😊😊
MY BROTHER IS BORN ON JUNE 21ST 2009
OMG!  I LIVED IN SANTA CLARA MOST MY LIFE!  Pizza party back in the day was Pizza and pipes it's next to Ben and Jerry's,McDonald's,and next door to Starbucks! wow small world
The only guy who can compete against him is himself
Damn he's Defeat Benjamin's Time by 6:05 to 5:54!
guys give your life to Christ but yeah man ate a whole 6lb pizza and looked liked he had room spare.🤣🤣
Too much olives man.
some day you will die of this kind of forceful eating therefore be a little bit careful
that pizza would have taken mee almost 6 hours to eat.
Once a (food) vacuum, always a (food) vacuum... only better, upgraded, updated
lol getting honey has nothing to lose but you also gain nothing. ive used it soooo often and NEVER gotten a code to work.
I will only believe if you eat all there without fast forwarding the video
bro defeated it 3x faster than 10 years ago
How are you not  not... f*at?
Try bigmamas  they have bigger pizza
I am litarly watching this when i am eating a pizza🤣🤣
Bro is too good he completed with himself
Nice 1 matt
frikking NASTY
😱how i felt inside when he started down playing his past self
Bro I can't even eat two slices that fast-
Video start 6:55
For the guys who are wondering, the actual challenge started a long way after 6.30 minutes into the video
See you in 10 years beating this
Bro was inhaling the slices literally 😁
Nice... I saw Matt eat a little Caesars pizza in one minute fifty nine seconds, with meilin, " should I spit it out?" 20 second fault.
Bro finished a slice of pizza in 8 seconds💀
Eat it in less than 10 minutes
You are something else mate!😯🍕🤢
Came to watch this once again. You should've weighed the box after you finished the pizza to see how much extra weight you had
Actual challenge starts at 6:54, other than that it was just six minutes of sponsorships to push the video to 10 mins lol
Bro is bullying himself 💀
Honestly, I never noticed your heterochromia until now, and now I can't stop noticing it! #EatOn! Kinda wish you wore the short you won for the occasion.
2069: Matt Stonie Eats a Slice of earth
40 minutes matt sits on his toilet. Its a personal combo..
I ate a 20 inch in 2 minutes 56 seconds with no drink and I'm not even a professional eater is that good?
can you do more videos cause you RoCk man!🙂👍
A true goat 🐐🔥
“You’re neck and neck with your old time.” Riiiight.. Hahaha
What a beast!!!!
putting the doom soundtrack over this makes this video 10 times better
2030 ....2 minutes flat
I wouldn't even be able to drink all that water he's drinking during those challenges
Matt stonie: finishes half a large pizza in 1 minute. Me:  didn’t finish half a slice of a small pizza.
Unbelievable!
He sweared ooo😂😮
It's sad that I eat like this without a challenge
This man invented the phrase: "'I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse"
I remember a few months ago completely eating a medium Domino's Pizza while driving, and I felt like I was going to puke from how full I was haha
28 yo stonie eats more food my hole family
When ever I watch his videos but subscribe to him when I watch you it makes me hungry
20 years later stonie: i will let my 28 self know that im gonna wreck this record and eat it in 5 seconds!
reducing his time by 2/3
I hope this doesn't affect his health 😅
Great job but mushroom and olives?!?!? Yuck
what the fuck was that???!? he just ripped into that pizza like a dog.
I did something that this guy can beat my time eating 1 Bag of Shake Shake Fries (BBQ): My total time was 2:32, special request dude..
how do you stay that thin after shoving all these?
The pizza box changed owner ship and it’s not even close to the same I was so disappointed miss the old Asian lady with the old arcade games I was devastated when they changed
Wasn’t your first it was a Gatorade bottle it was huge
0:00 Arrrr
Free pizza for a year, makes sense they went out of business. That’s just dumb
I love bibos ny pizza. By far the best pizza ive ever had
16 ounces in a pound, not 12
Still looking like a total deuschbag lol jkjk
W
5 minutes on a whole pizza? It takes me 10 minutes on one 💀
Rumors has it that pizza party went out of businesses because Matt ate too many pizzas in his one year free pass
I feel sorry for his toilet.
I can eat a 20 inch pizza in an hour. Are there any places left that do stuff like this?
This guy's stomach is scary, i can only eat one slice of that and be full for the rest of the day
WHy...LOL
What was that ,.....!¡!!!¡¡¿
Come to Peoria Illinois and try the biggest pizza place in Illinois called bacci’s pizza.
Why don't you try 2 or 3 20 size pizza less thatn 18 mins
2010 was when I was born
Depois dessa não dá pra chamar o Matt para um churrasco
What is the hardest food challenge  that no one completed?
Fake
nice to know matt stonie can eat a 6 pound baby in under 18 minutes
Love the content but how in the hell buddy???
Belly Buster: Stonieverse if Madness
He bully himself
TRUE ATHLETE OF 2020
Restaurant owners with food challenges when Matt Stonie walks in:    😑😔  I!!!  Declare!!!  Bankruptcyyyy!!!!!
This dude can eat a 6lb pizza faster than I can run a mile. Unreal
bro ate
How is he so thin
there are no leftovers in matt house
Pg
I was born in 2010
why did pizza party go out of business
This got me craving pizza
imagine doing this with the 70k $ pizza
Why a the man
im sorry but i cant ignore the fact this man ate half a 20 inch 6 pound pizza in 1 min.... i know hes probs gonna get a insane total finish time but i just had to point this out
"old man stonie gonna put down the gauntlet" hahahaha i died at that
Matt Stonie my good sir, you should've went for the 8-pound pizza, maybe another time??? Maybe???
MUST SEE T- V- PROUD PIZZA... WAY TO JAM IT
He absolutley destroyed this pizza😂😂
Bro , he eats this thing like an animal 🫤
A third of the time. Daaamn
Love the Stone but time to beat needs to be cutting 5 mins out of your video intros
Me : always thinking about what in matt stonie mouth  My brain : maybe portal strange
That was nuts you can eat faster than my dogs!
ehhhhh why mushroom? is it easier to hold down? not as heavy as sausage or pepperoni?
Mate dint complete the thing he fricking demolished it
That mountain mikes pizza looked bomb. 8 lbs. lol
My two toppings would be mushrooms and bacon best to topping pizza ever
Old man stonie from 2030 is going to dunk on 2020 Matt stonie isn’t he?
Congratulations your a Werepig..🤣
Pretty pathetic going up against a kid
matts liver knows it over when a BUNCH of food comes rushing down his kidneys
"May the best Matt Stonie win." Matt Stonie's in the later decades: We'll see about that...
I dare this man to eat and enjoy his meal for once
part of me is like “i could do that in 18 minutes” but that’s easy to say when i’ve never done it
I eated the half of That pizza in 8 minutes
Me eating slice*:Have food coma,bellyache
This just goes to show that experience and practice are the most important things in life.
i think ik why pizza party went out of business HE ATE ALL THEIR SUPPLY FOR PIZZA
Ayo that day was my birthday
i dont get how this is even possible, it is a big ass pizza dude inhales it in fucking under 6 minutes xD
You had to just sffu bout HONEY
He attacked the pizzaaa
he cant eat a 20 inch pizza before i can run a mile
Bro what are your shits like we need a video
The way he eats that pizza makes me feel like I've been abused.
6:55
lol
Humihinga ka pa ba?
Made his old self look normal that was amazing
I am so fucking hungry
Everybody suprised about he is eating that much food in 6 min but i think 6 min is pretty long time.
MAN IDK HOW YOU EAT THAT MUCH BUT STILL EVERYONE IS GOOD AT SOMETHING.
So weigh the box after.
They use the ingenering metrologic process lol.
Good job Matt
man looks angry at the pizza like hes eating it out of revenge
I swear nobody ever uses those little table things that they put in the middle of the pizza
STONIE, 2010, EAT ME!  Woof, Matt is dizzy from the pizza rush. Why isn't there a pizza joint named STONIES?🍕🍔🌭🌮🍳🥘🫕
Maybe do another one with a pitcher of 🍺
Your only competition in life is against yourself 😤😤😤
Məndə gedim pendir çörək yeyim
Matt Stonie is that type of guy who would try to break the same world record he broke again and again
That day I was born
I don't get why competitive eating exists. What's the point of eating all those food so fast if u can't enjoy it.
He ate a whole pizza + leftovers in under 6 minutes and moste
So he is 30 years old now !!!
Do uh just strave whole day and make the vedio😭
this video is a great motivation being the 3X stronger version of your self after 10 years with hardwork. that's literally life goals.
Those might be the most disgusting looking pizzas I've ever seen.
Now i know the technique to not get full easily competitive eaters stand when they eat so that they don't get full quickly  and the reason why i knew about this cause i searched it on google like most idiots who are curious like myself 🤣
Fun Fact: PIZZA 🍕is my favorite food of all time
Dude! Doesn’t that hurt your jaw?!
Can we just talk about 10:01 😂
His stomach be like :" give me my rent
i want
I could do that...walk in the park
yo matt!!! you went wayy too crasy eating that pizza my man
you eat like my cat😸
I can't put my finger on why I like your videos and HATE mukbang videos. I get that you are actually a pro.. But Its still just watching people eat food.
One, three, eight
Old man Stonie
Takes me 5 minutes to eat 3 slices 😂😭
Actually it's not a eating challenge. You are swallowing, it doesn't mean you are eating. While you are eating, you shouldn't be drinking water, If you do, that's the right eating challenge.
Is that logo from an ancient company speaking of which which was first a drydock establishment or a company that multiplies and if companies deny that they multiply which is actually an establishment then why is there more than 250 members
How do u never get fat bro?.. 😲
Milim's deafeat is sponsored by HONEY
Wow dude
love how he only competes with his own body
Matt stonie at his ex wedding 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hi Matt.... what about this? https://youtu.be/OOtfYeEVVjQ
Old man stonie put a woopin on baby stonie
So ridiculous and unnecessary.You're only hurting yourself
I don’t understand. How is he so skinny . Do they throw up after this ???
You shut down pizza party you monster… that’s what they get with a poor business model against a god like stonie hahah
That was scary impressive … holy speechless
I love your videos >3
Old man stonnie schooled baby matt😂😂👌🏽🔥.. definitely layed down the law
Real question. Looking for a legit answer. How does he digest almost solid food? There's no way it's broken down bc he barely chews. Any way this comes out has got to hurt. Am I missing vital info on how humans competition eat?
5:54 from 18 mins isn't bad at all that's crazy good I couldn't do that at all.
So I can know what size it is
How old are you?
the boss
The idea of a hungry Matt terrifies me.
the perferations are so you can fold the box in the lines, not rip it apart lol.
its been 10 years already... jesus.
185
petition for mrbeast x matt stonie to do the 6 foot pizza challenge
im saying this b4 the video starts he can do it in sub 10 minutes now
Where the “old man stonie” shirts
All you had to do is add pepperoni
Mushroom n olive, disgusting, ur a coward
cool
you can see just how much more powerful he’s become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaQ0C-yk13A
Heh
How many slices per minute you were eating? Wow
I feel like he is suffering from enjoying the food.
Matt Stonie excited laugh when he heard halfway at 1:38
Why doesn’t Matt have an actual Travel Channel show where he goes around the world beating food challenges?
Have you ever mistakenly eaten your finger during a challenge?
I just want to see this guy sit down and eat a meal like a normal person.
What's the point ?
Congratulations!for broke the record💎💎
Where does the food go?  His stomach isn't even distended?  His stomach has to be the size of a watermelon right now?  Also does he even chew at all?  Just take a bite and swallow it whole?
Im scared that he’ll choke🥺
Beast 👌
What was the point of buying the other two pizzas?
How-
You forgot the hot sauce 🤣🤣🤣
I had a pizza craving before.... Not anymore 😅
YouTube mayor gebre
Too long
I just  have 1 question ...how the hell doesn't he get fat?😃
Old Man Stonie is a B E A S T ! ! ! ! !
bruh how do u stay slim after eating that -_-
Honey is about to knock off raid shadow legend's sponsor crown
you know you’re good when no one else is close to being as good as you so you compete against yourself
Dude wtf i live a block away from where hes filming holy shit
That’s a lot of olives…
you killed me at mushroom and olive
Watching you eat is making me want to eat
skip to 5 minutes and 55 seconds for him to start eating
Gee those olives and mushrooms made my mouth water. Yum
Bro the burp got me dying laughing and he hasn't even started
Hes such a legend he literally has to go up against himself.
Stonie in the washroom: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ITS BURNING
love you man <3
Matt Stonie be like: 18:05 THATS NOTHING TO BE PROUD ABOUT!  me: eats one slice in 15:00
I could eat that pizza easily
When you got 7 min tell the school bus comes
Why does 15 year old Matt Stoney look like moistcrital
You’re my hero Matt Stonie
One third of the previous record holyshit
you make me hungry bro
Man, this dude prob has the worst poops. Like a whole roll of toilet paper worth.
i like and sudscribed
USE WARM WATER JOEY CHESTNUT USES WARM WATER 😝
This is how I eat after I fast
0:45 - 0:50 nice tshirt swap
Old man stonie is a bully, poor young toad
after i saw this video, i called the investor of this pizza joint and said its time to short your holdings bro.
Dang if you think that pizza is big, you should see my local pizza shop Goombas, they have a 30 inch pizza. (And it’s actually really good pizza) awesome time tho! You crushed your old time.
Why don't you get faattttt? 😦😦😦
cant belive he is already 30
wait you guys hating on pizza crust? that is the best part it balance the slimy chess of the pizza
Damn my guess was 10 minutes and he did it in half of that time
Video starts at 6:45
I literally did this last night cause I was high 😂 I'm jk I just ate a whole digorno pizza by myself lmfao
that’s a good deal I could definitely finish this in under an hour. Im not being sarcastic anybody could finish that. It’s along time.
What a waste of good pizza
My friends ur mom
Watch 10 years later "that's nothing I can eat it in 2m"
Man I eat NOTHING and I’m still fat. I’m borderline an*rexic. And I’m still 8-10 pounds overweight. If I consumed that many calories, I would be fat for a month. I would eat 6 pounds and gain 12 somehow. How tf does Matt stay perfectly skinny!? Also, I workout pretty hard 5x a week, and play basketball 1-2 days when I’m not working out. It’s insane.
I think half of the video is not eating the pizza it's self
How 🤔 is he still skinny??
Of course, he is off course camera when he vomits it out later.
is it just me like i feel like he is  going to bite his finger out
That pizza topping is gross
Is it a coincidence or did his March come out the same as his pizza
Oh I was about to comment it's cool a local pizza spot is still around 10 years later. Got a minute in and I'm sad :(
Do ya EVER puke afterwards?? Holy sh guy
Hed gotta smoke alota trees to be eatin like that💯🤣👍🏻🔥🤔
All 3??
🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Matt is a beast
jesus fuck the olives what the fuck
“2010, EAT IT” got me laughing 😂
I like how this man has no competitors so he ahs to compete against himself
it’s been a year?? dang
It would be interesting to see a stomach comparison before and after
Big portions of food give me anxiety and make me lose my appetite. If I feel it's gonna be tough to finish I don't even wanna start haha. But this guy is sooo excited to stuff himself every time 😂
God loves you all and you can all be saved (if not already) by just putting faith in Jesus Christ and repenting of sins (turning to God from sin and changing your mind on sin) And you should ask for forgiveness of your sins (this can be anywhere) have a nice day  Jesus is my lord! And the solution to hell!  And dressing sexually/posing sexually is a sin but it's forgivable but just because a sin is forgivable doesn't mean you should commit it that's abusing Gods grace/forgiveness or it could be.  And show mercy to be shown mercy by God And good deeds are kind acts that the person doing it has no cost for it.  ..
Ok Im not a fan of only mushrooms and olives on pizza. So my two toppings would be Onions and Pepparoni
How man shits you take a day? Geez that’s a lot of food.
Little stonie got destroyed
Well you are a professional now
So…  Megatoad VS Matt Stonie.
It was so good i just want more
Video starts at 06:50 Thank me later.
How this guy not fat
how he can be still skinny?
destroyed
how old are you?
If you opened up a restaurant called the "Stonie Grill" or "Old Man Stonie's" i would be down for it great portions and challenges every month. That would be pretty cool
My only enemy is me myself
How body don’t give up, my body gives up walking from the toilet to the sink
He swallowed it all up he barely chewed maybe
Matt Stonie vs Matt Stonie. I’m pulling for Matt.
I wonder how it is possible to fit this much into a stomach. I am said to eat a lot, but I certainly couldn't do this in a single sitting in any reasonable amount of time.
PIZZA TIME!
Fuck ton of olives
A large esophagus and small uvula would be great for competitive eaters
“20 inch”
Damn beating your own record by a mile 😆 😆   Also. Honest curiosity, does moving the head up and down as your biting into the food help? I've seen that done quite a bit  Or is it just instinctual?  Again, honest curiosity
that was beautiful
Gaviscon should sponsor you. Jeeeeesus.
I see the timer I see him eating it yet I can't help but think it's fake 5 MINUTES WTH
how is he so skinny!!!!!!
He ate 5 slices in 40 SECONDS 💀
Are you Human?? 😵
POV: this was filmed in the back of a class room.
Obviously “NY” pizza is going to be thin.
This isn't hard for an italian Like me
The i talians wont like this
In this video, they use pounds, ounces, and inches.  Centimeters, kilograms, and ounces, are much better.  Remember, the metric system is better.
Come on man, help me eat the moon ill eat 1 grams of dust
2030 Matt Stonie is already grinning
Honey saves you money but salad earns you money
Toba toba
He finished it faster than the time it takes to make the pizza
Pizza Party most likely closed due to lack of funds
Then here I am: getting sick from eating cocktail sausages too quickly (2 at a time lmao)
U know, I was VERY hungry today and I wanted to try eating two pizzas (around 30cm) in under 30 minutes and I got it in 18 minutes... is that much??😅
im hungry
Has Matt ever tried eating something slow?????
wowowowow
10 years lager he be like inhaling 10 pizza cartridges in under 5 seconds (world record 100000 calories)
Normal man - "I'm so hungry i could eat a horse" People - ok I'll get you something Matt stonie - "I'm so hungry i could eat a horse" People - *OH SHIT*
Skip to 6.30
Completely irrelevant but I just enjoyed the tastiest flavoured slice of mineral water I’ve ever eaten
Pure the GOAT😎😋🌃
When we have pizza for supper I can almost eat a whole pizza
I wish I could eat like that :c
Food challenge try man vs foods show
Imagine coming to some Fast food and seeing Matt eating slowly and enjoying his food :P
Never heard of that 😂
This is fake pizza im italiano
please italians dont see this
Where does the food go?😰 u have a giant stomach maybe😐
🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Eating 6lb of food in 18 min is bad????????? W......T........F bro! It takes me 18 min to eat 1/2 lb😂
Matt Stonie change your PFP!
"18:09 isn't impressive at all!" 10 Years older Matt RELAX, HES JUST A BOY! Btw sub 10 or u fell off.
When he came up close to the camera, I thought he was checking for a pimple or something
Joey chestnut be like: ima challenge this boi
Matt eats a whole pizza in 5:54. That’s quicker then me eating 1 slice lol. I eat 2 pieces and I’m like I can’t no more. Haha.
I just ate a 20" pizza the other week in like 2 hours, but not for a challenge or anything. Just because I felt like ordering pizza
A pizza that has olives and mushrooms is just the best pizza ever
I was 0 years old when he recorded the other vid 😮
This guy probably ran the pizza place out of business with all the pizza he ordered after winning the challenge
Im so hungry i could eat a car
Olive and mushroom pizza is the best pizza
The thing that I think is crazy is that he did the challenge the day before I was born
Looking like Joey Chestnut there with the sweats
I wanna try this
Doctor : if you eat a lot you will get fat Matt : whaaaat........
Wait your in New York
0:48 that hair is nothing to be proud about either
My Fear : All The Pizza is Will Be Gone Before My Restroom Break Is Over.
Matt Stonie in 2030: Look at this Matt Stonie back in 2020, 6 minutes? All right I'm about to eat this 6 pounds 20" pizza in only 2 minutes
I would enjoy one slice of that for an hour!!!!
Wow 1 year later and still shocking nice job
YEA 18 MINS IS DISGRACEFUL
This man just be competing w himself
does nickado avocado watch this lol
It's fascinating to see such huge pizzas. I'm curious, is this a global phenomenon or something restricted to the USA?
He finished one slice in ten seconds I can finish one in ten minutes
8:24 jajaja
6:15 "old man stonie "   that made me laugh so hard
In another 10 years he's going to beat it in 2 minutes
Be yourself bro, this felt a little forced
PIZZA
I REALLY DISLIKE HOW YOU FAST FORWARDED THE EATING! WE WATCH FOR THE EATING, NOT JUST THE RESULT!
haha get it (8:39)
6.55 mins wait...... Too long, switched off.........
bro rewatching this i realised how hard this is i can barely even eat a medium pizza by myself lol
Your digestive system 💀💀💀💀
Matt in 2030:That little schmuck back in 2020 thought he could eat, i will breathe the pizza in a second flat
this is making me want to order pizza for dinner lol.
Amazing
I have to fix my car and find this place. I WANT FREE PIZZA!!!
Teenie Stonie got beat! Well done.
i bet that when he goes to like a family dinner he just finishes like the whole table in like 4 minutes
Do food competitor poop much as they eat?
Give me plisss i'am indonesia
This good but where is pepperoni 🍕
Ez meg mi a faszra jó ? Semmire
you ever bite your finger on accident?
PiZZA IS LYFE!!!
Plot twist: Matt will eat this belly buster challenge in 2 minutes in 2030
He just bite and swallow.. thats it. Not chewing
Dang that place out of business... I hate when that happens.
My mind can't comprehend how we have people starving to death all around the world and on the other hand this 😔
8:28 kinda looks like reversed.Cool coincidence
It is 2021
How can he eat so much and still look so fit?
Pizza: Family size That one dude named family:
That pizza looks so f-ing delicious
Weighing the sub 10.9oz box would be a good ending.
I really want to know where he packed all of that pizza?
Wish you would have fast forwarded all the bullshit at the beginning...and actually showed the eating in real time.
so disgusting... but why do I keep watching?
wow! Where did he put it???
Jajajaja 🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🤣
he definitely got stoned after eating all of that mushrooms. lmao
His Girl: Oh you ordered pizza!  Matt: Sure did. His Girl: *turns around to grab a plate, than back to see the pizza gone* His Girl: Uhm... where'd the pizza go? Matt: Whatchu mean I ate it. His Girl: 😳🥴😵
I really want him to faceoff against kobayashi
but it was weight with box
10 years cut off like 10 minutes WOW!
Imagine if he started lifting weights… if you know you know
Do u also get hungry watching this
Idk, Matt still thin
All I can say is go get regular check ups with your GP. Do your bowel test at 30 not 50 because the invincibility of youth turns to regret later in life. In other words talk to your 50 yo self 🤙

Nobody: The restaurant: If you win this challenge you get the restaurant for free
Damn I would be happy if I finished 2 slices in 6 mins
The only other person i seen withthat hair back then was coryxkenshin... hell yeh
I was a skinny little fuck when I was in high school 15/16 year old me could destroy an entire pizza and still be hungry. Now I can barely eat 3 pieces.
Matts toilet: Ah shit
8:21 HE DESTROYED BENJAMIN'S RECORD TOO!!  In the first video, the top holder of the 20m 6lb pizza was Benjamin with 6mins 15seconds.  He's the top place holder now

6:51
People say: don’t eat junk food  Matt stonie: I don’t care!
10 years later future stonie finish thew challenge in 1 minute
Matt: "Can't wait to try this". *inhales the entire pizza 2 seconds later*
you ate it faster than my mile
it takes me 5 mins to eat 1 slice of pizza
I also eat a lot more than average man, but let me tell you, if u don't enjoy the taste of food and eat so fast, what's the fun? U will win rewards, but u won't get the pleasure of the taste of the food itself.
youtube algorithm be tripping recommending me this that was uploaded exactly a year ago
I dont know why I keep watching matt stonie videos... food eating is a weird genre. All I know is they make me hungry, hes very entertaining and I never watch only one at a time...
6:53  Pizza: why do I hear boss music?..
It's like if lui kang was eating for earth realm.
Shout out to everyone in California that has to eat this disgusting pizza.
Man what the hell it take me 5 min to eat a god damn chip bag
This guy inspires me because there’s a pizza place where I live where you have 2 to 10 pound pizzas all by yourself with two other people that have their own 210 pound pizzas and you have to finish it within 30 minutes and they’re not throw up for 10 minutes
You did your 1st food challenge on my 2nd birthday 😊
How does he barps before starting to eat 🤔
He eating lots of food but he is not so fat why?
Everytime I watch him eat, it always encourages me to finish my food
Over 6 minutes before you even start.... Not on.......

I just ate. But now I'm hungry again. How on earth am I supposed to watch these videos
“I’m actually starving” scary words from Matt.
They give you free pizza for a year because they know you will never come back after eating it
young Stonie only lost because he still had his dignity
Audra Mae just YouTuber this YouTuber inside

Download honey
Damn that pizza looked good. I can probably eat that by myself. Not sure about in the hour though, but for sure in my stomach. xD
I can eat an entire pizza .. but I can’t eat it fast lmao

Old Matt stonie: finished eating pizza at 5:54, he just had a bri’ish tea party
You gotta do the Big Mamma and Papas 50 inch pizza. You might need some friends with you though.

Let's be honest those sounds he was making while choking it all down were super gross. This can't be good for you.
Also when he ate all of that his mouth was like a chipmunk
Inmaine his hunger ay night where you get that super hunger

What Matt didn't tell us is he visited Pizza Party a couple of times afterwards and basically put them out of business.

thats literally a pound of food entering your body under a minute 6 times
Bro I can't even eat 4 slices without being full
7:22 he was like oh shit this is easier than i thought
I think the phrase "I don't know where he puts it all" has never been more pertinent!
he measured both ways the diameter, its a circle it would be the same diameter any way you measure it
he got free pizza for one year at pizza party and they shut down lmao, how many did he eat????
Er stopft ganz schön 😂
U should eat a meal slowly one day.we really want to see that

You barely chewed the pizza! How do you digest all that?
But for real what do they do after they finished are they puking it all back up?`because i dont think this amount of unchewed food is healthy and must kinda hurt the stomage when digesting
I can’t even eat normally without being able to swallow, wtf is this
Did you know this guy dont eat 3 days after doing a challenge
This dude doesn't eat, he stuffs it in his mouth and it drains 😹
This what my budy does while he saw me coming towards him to have a single bite.
You look like ur in Vegas
Nobody:  Matt Stonie: Matt Stonie who?
No wonder they ars out of business that's some easy challenge everyone must if been getting free pizza.

Come to the uk chip-shops  you will struggle
Lol I commented when this video first came out saying Matt Stonie needs to go back to his older content because the ads in this were too much. I went ahead and timed it but Matt literally starts eating at 6:54 and finishes at 8:19 which is a whole minute and 25 seconds of him doing the challenge in this video. A ten minute video only had a minute 25 of the actual challenge. Lame
Good Genesis Christ every time I watch this I want to order pizza
How do you stay so fit and eat all that food?
I have the same microwave
Mushroom on pizza is nasty
6 pounds? That's a rather expensive pizza...

You need to be careful bro, this kinda eating has long term effects, although I find it entertaining and you make hungry af, I don't want you to die of any disease/ disorder.

You should buy one of the 55inch pizzas and try and finish it yourself
This Dude swallow more than a anaconda:)

ABC’s of SALVATION  ADMIT: You’re a sinner, condemned to DEATH (physical & spiritual) .  Romans 3:10, 23 There is none righteous, no, not one … For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans 6:23 & James 1:15 the wages of sin is death … sin, when it is finished bringeth forth death. (Spiritual death is eternity in HELL !)  BELIEVE: that JESUS died, rose again, and that HE ALONE can save you from sin, death, and hell.  Romans 10:9-10 if you: believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.  CONFESS: JESUS CHRIST, and nothing else, as your own Saviour. Romans 10:9, 10 & 13 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus … confession is made unto salvation … whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Before it’s too late, forever, DO IT NOW! God’s gift is FREE and as easy as A-B-C !.

I like eating slow and in small amounts every bite so I would take an 40 - 60 minutes or more My gawd
Matt's wife is taking care of him like his mom for sure.
I can do that in 3               Evers
Matt stonie in 2030: 5 min 54 second thats pathetic.
I want to see 2 things: 1) you enjoying the food that you eat 2) your belly
When he started talking about honey I thought he was mrbeast for a sec
Mushroom and olive? Worst 2 pizza toppings ever.

In 6 min i wouldnt even have finished  3 slices 😅😂
How can he is so fit yr
How much do you shit?
2020 suck!!
Me thinking just put 10 mins seeing him stuff his face up postponing cooking of my dinner
Believe in JESUS, we are all sinners deserving the wrath of GOD, because we sin against a holy and just and perfect GOD. Therefore we all deserve the punishment hell, but GOD in his rich grace and mercy by which he loved us sent JESUS to die  for us on the cross to leave  his throne and suffer for us. To  be the perfect  sacrifice for us because he  himself was sinless and perfect. That if we would have a repentant heart and believe in JESUS and place our faith in him,we will be saved from the eternal punishment and be given eternal life.
How many fucking olives can you fit on a pizza
I don't get why you have such an inefficient weight. : P that plastic lit even get's me annoyed
You should do one where you invite people over for the Super Bowl and have all the food laid out, have a friend take everyone for a "quick tour" of the house and when they come back all the food is gone Bon Jovi... hilarious.
I wanna be in these challenges but not actually do the challenge just eat 😂
6:49 Growl than metal breakdown... I think stonie Is a secret metalhead
10 years ? were you like five then??
How is he not fat.. I barely eat anything and I am fat as heck :≤
8:23 KONO DIO DA!
I'm starting to like this YouTube channel better than LA beast
if my calculation is right and i plus 3 of the 20 inches of the pizzas is gonna be a 60 inches of pizza if you combine them
川鲁人家是什么餐馆
wouldn't it make more sense to eat the pizza toppings side out so it's easier to swallow?
How can you tell how good or disgusting food taste? Plus you look in so much pain as you shove all that in. But damn you're good haha
Does he chew?
Absolutely amazing bro.
I like to know his monthly grocery bill..and oh yeah, also a monthly toilet paper 🧻 bill.
2040: *”eats whole pizza in 4 seconds”*  Edit: dang it’s been a year and I did not think this would blow up
Normaly I get annoyed when youtubers have reallyyyy long intros and take forever to get to the point,,,but when Matt does it I honestly don't mind💀✨
Нееен, лучше с кайфом съесть, чем так пихать и давится.

Matt Stonie's Belly: I am SPEED. 🏃
All the food he eats looks so good but he probably doesn't get to appreciate the taste as much cause he's ramming it down his throat
This is how my friends eat when we agree to share a pizza...
Mikhori baram
matt stonie won
Matt’s 28? I always thought he was like 23, I mean then again that’s still about 5 years younger.

He destroyed the record before he even attempted it
Hey matt do a challenge eating three of these pizzas

Just when I watch other food challengers and think some are coming into your realm you go and do something like this. And prove once again why you’re still the goat.

So bad 👎

Fast time wow
Only Matt stonie can beat Matt stonie 😉😉😉
Insane!
Sic Mundus Creatus Est  I don't know why but l had a feeling like l was watching DARK series at the start.

In 2010 I was still a 2 t it years old girl lol

Current challenges I personally know about : Pizza challenge in my area: Westside Pizza(yakima county). Also bullseye burger, awesome place and community oriented.  Also sort of near me - Beth's cafe in Seattle. Amazing omelets either way if you end up there. Love that place in general. Wave Island's giganitic sushi challenge - Spokane area. Dong thap super bowl challenge, Seattle. Stuffy's 10lb cinnamon roll challenge, longview area I think. They also have an omelet challenge, though I prefer Beth's tbh ;)... On another note, 1/3 of the time. Indeed, young Stonie. Suck it.
That  "Old Man Stonie"  Was the cutest thing out of 2020. 🤙🏼🙃
I would kill to have that great of a metabolism
Awesome bro I watch your videos sometimes but honestly do you actually keep it down or 🤮afterwards. With all RESPECT great job!

Matt probably ate that pizza quicker then it took them to dress the pizza hahaha
2040 Matt Stonies: Eats pizza so fast that he travels back to past..
No wonder Pizza Party closed they gave Mat 1 year of free pizza
I ate a 24 inch pizza the other day I still hate myself for it
can we just appreciate the way he says pizza!
The sad thing is that this will probably be his fastest time. Baby Matt got smoked, but Old Matt won't be able to top Young Matt in 10 years time.
Can we just take a minute t- oh... he’s done!
hahaha the video is also not 18 minutes
Just cheese and olives? 🤢
Name of song?

Mans looking like the ninja turtles when he is eating the pizza
When your parents say “throw away the pizza in 6 minutes”      Matt Stonie: *Hold my beer*    Also Matt stonie: eats a 6 pound pizza in under 6 minutes.
10 years later the whole pizza in one minute 😂
Imagine buying a pizza and going to the bathroom and saying “I’ll be back in 5”
And we wonder how he loses these pounds so quickly or he just never seems to gain anything..
I always have the impression one time he’s going to miss swallow and choke at the speed he’s eating there
How can you do that!?!?!
me wanting to enjoy pizza...  matt stonie:
You're telling me an establishment that offered free food for a year to whoever eats the most gargantuan serving, went out of business? Heck
🍕
Watching your videos it feels like may be goku is real 🤔🤔

Hello Matt, my name is Marius, I’m working for the restaurant The Burgr Factory, from Romania We are the best burger restaurant in the world with over 90 types of burgers in the menu and with a lot of challenges and crazy ideas that we post on our YouTube channel.  Look, I’m perfectly conscious that I’m just another random guy that message you, ( and hopefully not annoying you ) but I’m a very huge fan and I’m watching you on YouTube for a couple of years and I’m always get very surprised of your crazy challenges. In our restaurant, The Burgr Factory, we have a lot of challenges, but the most popular one is The Bossman Challenge with a 5-6kg burger who needs to be done in 30 minutes. By far, nobody finish it and I’m 1000% sure that you will.  I will love if you can come to Romania and make a vlog together, i know this will be a great and fun experience for both of us, an amazing opportunity for me to meet you and for you to visit a tremendous and  underrated country.  And please, don’t think about the money or any kind of expenses like the transport or the hotel, it’s our pleasure to solve that.  We just just want to make new friends and have an amazing experience together   Please, consider my invitation and think about it, I do really believe this will be a great experience for both of us  Have a great day!  With all respect, Marius Surmei
That is a diet that I call death!

MATTHEW STONIE I AM YOUR MOTHER AND I TELL YOU TO SLOW DOWN WHEN YOU EAT😡

Erik the electric challenged you to the 10,000 calorie anobolic cookbook challenge. He said he thinks you can’t eat it all in 1 sitting
https://youtu.be/_0s4fl2y7ZA
you’re 28 wtf???!!!
Morgan is funny as ever. And sick feat Matt!!!
Ok
Holy fuck you crushed it!!! Way to go!!! 🤘
Baby stonie destroyed by impressive jawline Mr. Stonie
Do the anabolic cookbook challenge that Greg Doucette, Will Tennyson, and Eriktheelectric did!
Please make a behind a scene video, where you talking about the best challenge, the fun you have at that, but also about the danger by doing this untrained. Did you ever need medical attention ?  And things like that, you'll know where the way goes....  And could you please tell people like me, how to eat so much calories etc. if they wanna gain some weight while they struggling with pain in stomach even after a slice of bread  - how you fight against your body signal of a full belly.  I made the experience too, and without (really a little bit!) alcohol or pain killers like vicodine or tillidin - i could not eat much. But this is not the point. I would really appreciate it... Now one is doing this. Please be the one who do it. Let me and us know how u think about it . Thank you
now hes the old man
Yo bro, you got challenged by @ErikTheElectric . Really want to see you destroying the challenge . Please give it a try!
So Fast 😭
Never eat your fingers.. 👍

My dude only bites he doesn’t even swallow.
A few things I’ve noticed about Matt Stonie Vlogs people may have not: 1. I just noticed his shirt (or this shirt) colored aren’t just stripes but a hot dog bun he got from a hot dog competition. 2. The man always wears a band on his head for the Vlogs 3. Never eats with his left hand 4. 98% of the time he Vlogs in his kitchen  5. He always wears black cloths 6. He has a plant in his kitchen he never talks about. (Except for this vlog) 7. He might always have a band on his rist the majority of the time  8. He never introduces his brother of family 9. He’s never mean or mad 10. He usually says he lives in San Jose and here he said he lives in Hawaii  11. Matt and his bro (or whatever/whoever/however that is) have a really similar laugh 12. There’s not one episode where he doesn’t find something to laugh about. Which is good. 13. He never talks about his life. 14. He barely talks about the times he needs to relieve himself or otherwise... 15. Now it’s your turn...
He looks and sounds gay 😂😂😂
rip van halen
,
he eat like anime characters
Just saying but I eat pizzas in 3 minutes Bec it’s my fav food- cheese pizza lol

Old man Stonie strength.
Great vid, Matt! Slight correction at 4:23 though. There are 16oz on a pound so 5lbs 9oz plus 3oz doesn't equal 6lbs. I think he meant to say it needs to be 7 more oz.
Where n the fxxk did it go that dude is my size and I can’t eat but like 4 slices and I’m full actually I’m full just from watching nm....
How can he eat all of that but still skinny, meanwhile here I am just eating a one slice of pizza and think that I'm so fat as fvk HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA NICE ONEE!

OMG
If you're reading this, the enemy doesn't wants us to forget our past mistakes. He wants us to obsess over our problems. He wants us to worry. To stress out over all of our struggles. Don't listen to the enemy. May GOD give you the strength to fight your battles. May God give you the strength to make it through the day. May GOD Bless you with everlasting Faith, Love, Peace &  Happiness. In JESUS name.

Poor toilet...
This guy took the phrase, "I'm so hungry that I can eat a pizza in 5 minutes." To the  next level.

Matt stonie eats faster  At last: what was the taste,or flavour of the pizza??

I challenge mat to do a challenge in live
That was gross
I have a challenge, The saltiest pretzels challenge, o basically u get pretzels and pour so much salt on them, go ham! Then time it and see how fast u can do it.
I know this sounds silly but thanks for wearing a mask. Some youtubers seem to forget that their audience is influenced by their actions and don't, when they should.
You are not afraid of the corona pandemic killing you but you are not wearing a mask, I cannot believe the epidemic in America is stressful and many people are playing around.
انته عربي؟ لايك
2030 - 2:22
Matt you should eat what the flash eats

He is not fat because once he gets fat his cholesterol and sugar level would go high drastically as the amount he eats . So, he just eat these foods for the purpose of the video and takes normal meal every day.  That's the secret. Otherwise he would have died until now due to diabetes.
I suggest umm you challenge beard meets food
Matt are u actually 5"8 feet ? or the internet is lying
How isnt you fat
DEMOLISHED
matt's stomach is bedrock
i dont under stand how he eats so much but looks skinny
I feel bad for pizza party but I don't think free pizza for a year is a good business idea
Where is the fat going  on his body 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Whats his weight? 🤔
He should do a htb challenge
Try the Cereal  Killerz place in Las Vegas, Nevada. You have to it a big bowl of cereal within 45 minutes. I wanna see how long it’ll take you!

And one more thing how do manage to stay so thin You are so good at these food changes 👍🏻
Brooooo looooollllll
bro how do you eat this much and not high
Matt please read this. Hey man I don't know if you like doing what you are doing or your just doing it to pay the bills but I need to tell you something you may or may not want to hear. There may be negative comments but this is for your eternal soul and your current health. First of all Jesus is the only way to salvation and if you or anyone else at there death bed is reading this just ask him to forgive you of your sins and you will be forgiven. Okay gluttony is a deadly sin man. We really think you need to see a doctor and get your liver values checked and maybe your kidneys and anything else that's a filter in your body. That's a whole lot of food and it looks like it hurts. Picture your liver like a sponge and it has to get certain things out or a vacuum cleaner filter. Just please be careful.
Matt stonie: today we will be eating a elephant in under 5 minutes
My fav pizza is black olives and mushrooms too, so this made me super hungry. Good job!
Do the dirty dozen challenge. 🙏🏽
Dang a mushroom pizza sound bomb right now in quarantine

This man single handedly has put every all you can eat buffet out of business

Y’all got faster and Morgan got more excitable on the count down. Nahhh! Y’all the best!
Got a new world record for you. See how many cans of asparagus you can eat in 5 minutes. Or see if you can get like 25 cans of something inside your body in the fastest time
I would have taken the better looking lighter weight pizza, that had the nicer crust and just added toppings from one of the others to make it weigh 6lbs
Bro this dude is 28 and eats whole citys food supplys
Me hungry af and has a headache because of it and still watching be like  oof ):)
Matt, Geoff ate that for breakfast
Omg I would love to see you and molly do a eating challenge race !!
Only Lord Jesus Christ can save the the world, the world is coming to an end soon. Lord God is coming back to judge the world, there are people who are burning in hell right now because they rejected the Gospel of Lord Jesus Christ. Choose Heaven, don’t believe in and follow celebrities, they’ll lead you to hell. ONLY the Creator of Heaven and Earth can save your soul. Confess Lord Jesus Christ and believe in your heart that He died for your sins and rose on the third day. Repent from sinning, confess your sins and ask for forgiveness, He will forgive you. Be sincere and God will hear you.
Bro I really wanna know how do u not get horrible stomach aces after eating that much like the heart burn must be insane 😭😭
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
He should be in Man vs Food
He eats enough amount of food to feed the earth for 100 years and is thin I eat a single dorito Obesity: guess you called me
So I’m trying to get bigger and gain weight and when I’m eating I will put on a Matt Stonie video to encourage myself to eat more😂
Only now have I just considered the fact that his shits must be mad.
Morgan!!!!
So let’s all agree to watch you smoke “old man Stonie” in 2030. Cool??
Do a Quang Tran feast challenge
Try to eat a bacon king
Can't tell if Matt's eating fast or if time slows down when Matt stonie eats 🤔
Can you do a video with joey chestnut
Me when i saw the whole video: Did he just literally made the pizza a sandwich?!
Dude I guessed 6 minutes I was basically right!!!
Do Mallomars
Matts friend: How much pizza do you want?  Matt: Hmmm.. I think I will have, tweellllvvve.
I literally just watched your Belly Buster video like 4 or 5 days ago

Yeser
why did i expect an ad at 6:55 😂
7:07 the way he eats is satisfying 🔥

What a legend
that long hair was gross glad you cut it lol
Petition for matt stonie to make an asmr video
I hope you can make the one chip chaleng
Why is he so thin damnnnnn 😂
Now, this is a 10-year challenge I can get behind.
Legend has it that he eats so fast that the food he eats looks the same going on as coming out.
So every 10 years he becomes roughly 3.6 times more efficient. So that must mean in 70 years he will be able to eat this in roughly 0.005 seconds
Thats simple for matt
Keep blessin us wit videos to see when we're high high ✌️✌️✌️✌️😂
Eat döner kebab
You should do a challenge going up against Joey chestnut.
Respect

Nobody:  That one kid who starts eating your lunch when your back is turned: 6:57
"Stonies Pizza" sounds like a place where u smoke up and eat pizza. Not a bad idea tbh.
Matt Stonie is probably throwing up most of the food he eats during a challenge just look at him and the amount of calories he consumed during these challenges
😋

Mushrooms and olives???? Worse. Toppings. Ever.
Matt Stonie, you are a legend!
damn! less than 6 mins!! Impressive!
Notice the time on the stove starts at 4:53 when the challenge begins and ends after the challenge ends on 5:07.. So.. it took 14 minutes to eat the pizza. not ~6minutes.. Cheater!
Matt prolly has his plumber on a speed dial 💀
You eat a lot of food, but you do not become obese
How.... the.... flying .... pizza
How do people actually do this? Surely it’s not normal?!😂
whyyyy mushrooms and olives????? two worst toppings
Questi sono gli italiani disgustati in questo video 👇
This is the guy I fear in the math problems
Do you keep that down, or throw up?
This better then niko avacado
This guy is a beast!

In 2030 He will beat it once again
Anybody wondering how much this dude sh*ts jeeez

First person who measure before eating
You would thing Matt Stonie would look like Badlands Chugs but no, he looks like a skinny dude
Matt: "I feel like I can take a nap right now."  Me: Yeah, more like you can take a crap!😂😂
Next, eat 413 chicken nuggets and see if you become paralyzed or not
After watching this, I have to use the bathroom. Damn, Stonie! You're killing it, bro! Buy merch
I love the way that he keeps his videos real like even when he literally chokes on his food he shows the part and I love his honesty ^ v ^

*10 years later*  Matt Stonie : Guys, today I'm gonna be challenging my 10 years old self.  Pizza : Ah shit! Here we go again!
I think his neurons which are responsible for stopping him from eating are dead
i feel bad for his stomach like where does all that food go and he still skinny even 10 intense hours at the gym won't burn all them calories down jeez
Why my mouth is watering? haha
I think he vomits everything that he has eaten..after the video .. may be that's the reason he's not getting fat or any health issues like indigestion. Ps- I saw only few videos and don't know about this channel completely. Share ur views
I think this guy never has a regular meal without a challenge to it 😅

F for his toilet 🤣
Mad that I missed the merch. Congratulations on the domination!
I actually thought this man gave up on these challenges
RIP Matt Stoney. Can't believe he died... I guess he died doing what he loved. Damn. See ya in the next life man.    Just kidding! I had you all going for a second though! Your hearts probably dropped and were about to do a web-search to see if it was true. I'm not THAT cruel at least ;-)
Those who wants to eat this so bad but can't eat because of COVID-19 pandemic disliked the video🤣🤣
Luffy number 2
My god!! I’d think you’d be very obese by now but looking at you, you look like a iron man!!
Peter Dowdeswell's mind blown.
He’s not even enjoying the food. :/
4 pizzas is delicious  and l'd love to eat 4 pizzas like matt stonie cause  matt stonie is the best he broke his record always and because his brother eat more slowly than matt stonie but its important to eat because the food has magic and is the paradise
Wtf did I just watch
Liked because of Ghost. Wish I could double like for the video, too. Good job , dude! Crushed it!!
Matt Stonie is top 3 in my arsenal of fav youtubers. He is so original. Never had an editor, uses the same edits as he has since the beginning, and the profile pic has never changed.
Man im dead everytime matt chokes😂😂
Can I have some please?
Is your toilet made out of titanium
Can you please try to kill your old record of the 14lb Burger🙏🔥❤
Dude..I live so close to here. I see it almost every day! Can’t believe I friggin missed you.
Did anyone Saw Big Big big big big big youtubers Not Wearing mask But Stonie Is Wearing a Mask Solid love it
Me at a birthday party trying to eat as much as I can because my parents starve me and I live in a basement.
Matt- I think that a card board box is at most 10 oz. Me- DO YOU KNOW HOW HEAVY A CARD BOARD PIZZA WEIGHS! ITS SO HEAVY!
Matt Stonie is really good at doing mukbang videos
Which half of the pizza was best?
I spend 5 min eating one slice while he finishes an extra large pizza
Can you imagine if you brought home a 20 inch pizza and you took 5 mins to get in your comfy clothes and the pizza was gone when you returned 🤘😜. Damn Stonie. Shakes fist 😂.
I Think He Should Also Redo The 14 Pound Burger Challenge He Did Around 7 Years Ago
Dude, Joel Hasen could destroy you. Wake up.
GG anjer👍👍😂
5:40 matt stonie looking at his creation like his firstborn child
he sitting in back with seatbelt on
He didn't eat the box I'm confused
You did amazing. You the 🐐. Gotta cut the gagging out tho lol lowkey cringe... high key
Does he have a girlfriend
For your next challenge you should do powdered donuts: my favorite 🤩
matt stonie should redo the 14lb "Big Mac" Burger Challenge that he failed years ago
3x faster good job
I consider myself well table mannered.  I experienced wolfing food down like him and it was primal delicious.
poor toilet
my guy literally do be lookin like curious george when he chomps on dem foods
What would his children be like
So I can clearly say to this Matt stonie of 2020 see you in 2030 bro when the Matt 2030 shows up
Congratulations Matt !  Ten years older and 3X faster.  Very impressive performance.  (Repeat in 2030 ??)
Do you even enjoy any of the food you eat I’m just asking I love you vids but god damn

Why your not getting fatt for. The food

Girlfriend's father- Son what do you do for living Matt stonie- I eat for living. Father shocks stonie rocks😂😂
If stonie is hungry you know its getting serious
Do you even chew?!?!?!?
Legend has it Matt has 2 throats, one to inhale air, the other to inhale food

I feel like his merch should say ‘’ DREAM BIG BUT EAT BIGGER
Grabe naman
You rock!!!
I just have one question, where do you put all the food after every challenge? Your skinny and I couldn't  even all of that, maybe half but that's it.
Next time he does this challenge he will finish it in 5 seconds....
2010 Stonie: I completed a pizza challenge with ease.  2020 Stonie: My record is better than yours.  2030 Stonie: Both y'all's records is trash!
Coronavirus

I'm surprised how Matt chugs down so much food but stays so fit he's insane
Btw Merch is sold out 😔
How does he eat a whole damn 6 lb pizza and still looks slim?! I’ll have 2 slices and my stomach grows twice in size. 😒
What happens when he’s hungry like he have to eat this much
20" pizza: am i joke to you? Matt: Of course . .
I’m convinced he doesn’t swallow. The food just gets absorbed into his cheeks. 🐹
You should do a video on what you eat in a normal day
Interesting
You should try the Fat Sals challenge!!
How big is is poop?!
the music always fits matt so well
He is acting like 18:05 minutes is bad!!!
Man I'm so glad you're not a cannibal.
OMG his poor stomach it must hurt after these videos how can he even pig them down like that
wow just wow to be so small and eat so much 😳❤️🤤
Do you guys buy food for your family too ? When you do these challenges ?
Damn,  I barely got time to watch some YouTube and I thought this video was uploaded today, was so excited to cop some merch, just to find out it's all sold out !! :( Matt, please tell me you're restocking this drop...
Is anyone jealous on how delicious that pizza looks?
In 10 years, time will be less than 2 min!
I think i know how he can eat all this food  He's the flash 😹⚡
10 years of competitive speed eating. Holy cow
When you eating 70+ hotdogs in 10 minutes? 🤣
:)
911: 911, what's your emergency?  The toilet: AHHHHHHH HE COMING HELP HES COMING!!!!!!
Local businesses have to certify they're not operating in the same town as Matt if they wanna run an eating contest to win pizza for a year.
Eat a 50 pound pizza from big mamas and papas pizzeria

Sponsoring honey mrbeast would be so proud😇
When are we going to see an “eating an entire bag of warhead” speed eating challenge
Can we just take a minute to thank him for never clickbaiting us
Notice when Matt takes a  massive bite he crosses his eyes?  He must be part great white shark.
This is how many gallons of shit he crapped out after this 👇

A goddamn maniac he is I tell you....🍕🥇🏆
Matt is just a disguised Indian at a wedding dinner
I love black olives I want a slice 🐽🐖🐷😁
2 uploads in a week what is this sorcery?
Who else would be scared as hell of choking?
Matt: “A whole pie in 18 minutes is pathetic.”  *Me 30 minutes into my first slice: 👀
Dang it, I wanted the merch 😭

My confusion is 3 times equalizes and 2 times multiplies by "2". 2030: 1:53 2x or 3x faster. 2040:  40 seconds (0:40) 2 or 3x faster. 2050:  20 (0:20) again 2 or 3x times faster. 2060: 6.5 seconds (0:6.5) again 2x and 3x faster. 2070: 2 seconds (0:2) again 2x or 3 faster. 2080: oh no dear you don't want to know what happened in this year you'll vomit. Thanks for reading may your parents live longer than you.

How do you not die from eating like this? Let alone stay so skinny

Video Starts at 6:55
Matt Stonie is that one guy that survives during the apocalypse only because he can eat anything
I just want omit after looking that yo
This guy is so responsable for going yo the gym and not getting fat its actually impressive AF and he may be less lazy and more responsable than 80% OF ALL HUMANS IN EARTH(I didin’t search this up so it may be not acurate)
When he gags a little....I gag a little. Props man.
Matt Stonie is a legend.
The fact that he gags while still continues to eat is what... makes me stay? idk. I'm disgusted with myself, honestly.
Ok guys, let's wait for 10 years, can he beat this
I think the government needs to send occasional stimulus packages to Matt because if this man runs out of food our nation might be in danger. People make jokes about big chungus. I fear THIS chungus.
Do u ever hickup?
3:15 whats the songs name?
Omg finally uploaded
Anyone wonder how he stays fit asf
now i wanna see you do the 24,000 calories toblerone challenge

How do you not get fat? 😒
YOU ATE THAT LITTERALY
do you usually throw up after big challenges like these or spicy ones or you just soak everything into your being?
And how the hell is he still skinny till now😭.I
After all these years, probably eating slower is going to be the hardest challenge for him😂
is this mans stomach a black hole
Gluttony from FMA Brotherhood didn't stand any chance against Matt.
Matt ¿can you eat a entire massive pan of paella? orrr perhaps ¿a entire spanish cured ham?
Old man Stonie just built different
How are you not fat?
Do the world's largest pizza slice
I think Matt should start a vlog channel
Berzerk mode!
Did you know, that its faster to eat pizza when you fold it toppings outside.
this guy is destroying food
Matt goes to a store Announcement: Matt Stonie has entered. All customers, buy what you want fast!!!

Your 28 years old?
Can you fighting with nat in thailand. https://youtu.be/gexLkireXhU
I work at a chain called "Benny's" we used to have a challenge where you have to eat 28" of a 2 topping (Pepperoni and Sausage) pizza in 1 hour and if you complete it, we'd give you 500$. it weighed about 9lbs. I've never did it myself but I've had to cook that son of a gun multiple times.
God where does all that food go?
Hatsofffffff
Matt, i have a challenge for you, reach out to me and we'll make it happen. It is in NY
Мэтти это из Республики Коми пишу, где по русски друг:)))?
It’s all fun and games until Matt Stonie is “Starving”
Didn't eat the Pizza Box. Doesn't count.
He’s turned into mr beast (clue honeyy
why is he not fat but he eats lots of food a nd when I do it it doesn't work
Matt 2030: ok guys my first challenge eating a whole grown man
Can’t wait for you to beat this record when you’re older matt stonie in 10 years.
Live example of "destroying things is easier than building them". 😌
Можно хатябы мини перевот кто там знает русский
Deez nuts Hahaha right at the end 😂😂😂
Queria ver comendo uma pizza brasileira desse tamanho
Там кто-то руски да или нет я фразу просто услышал вот ето давай бестрей
He cut his time in half
Sometimes I feel like I can compete with him when I am hungry but after eating one plate of meal I feel like who the hell m I comparing with?
Background should have been Michael Jackson beat it
Do ur first vid 128 ounce Gatorade chug 37 seconds
These days he talks more than he eats
Dude this really not healthy for him it's way too much food for a Human body to handle I know I get views and  all but health is more important
You should try oatmeal. I find it hard to eat
Could you show an aftermath of what you do right after youve done a challenge so we can see if you just go to sleep right after or if theres some method that you have that allows you to burn all those calories fast
Am I the only one the anxiety goes 📉 afraid he's gonna bite his finger off??
He eat 6 pounds in 6 minutes when he is “quite hungry” What if he was STARVING, I think he could eat the whole mcdonalds
You should challenge a dog
18? More like 13😂
Me : goes to wash hands  Matt : finishes the pizza
How is this dude skinny still?
Bc itna khata h tab bhi itna patla
The more you eat the more you poop 💩
Matt Stonie v Joey Chestnut. Make it happen

Me after eating me leg piece of chicken - My stomach is full right now   Matt stone after eating 100 pieces of chicken - I am quit hungry right now    🤣
He starts eating at 6:57
My anxiety just said don’t get ahead of yourself

So 2040 will be even less time right?
I like the idea of going back to do old challenges

Furious Pete vs Matt Stonie I wanna see it😃😃😃😃🍔🍔🌭🌭🥓🥩🍗🍖🥪🍕🌯🌮🍝🥗🍚🥃🥛🍽🍽🍟🍟🥞🥞🧇🥐🥯
Dude has 3 ads on a 10 min video, honey and merch ad inside the actual video, and a pinned comment about said merch. Pretty obnoxious but hey make that money i guess
Whenever this guy uploads a Video its on YouTube TRENDING 💯🔥
Next time, he should eat 2 Bibo's 20" pies. It is easily in the top 3 of pizzerias in Santa Clara county. The dough is incredibly flavorful, they become just like NY style if you ask for it "crispy", and they are from NY to boot. Definitely would have made the challenge more palatable. If not, go to Tony's up in SF. They make the best thin crust pies in NorCal.
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved.  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written(Hebrews 9 : 27);   ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’
Wtf!!!! I ate a 1 slize of pizza in 10mins😂

He eats so much but he is still not fat due to regular workout or what ?

*Hey ... to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
Oatmeal challenge?!? $1000 bucks you can't do a family sized tin!? 10:00 min
Just say this “So you will be saved, if you honestly say, “Jesus is Lord,” and if you believe with all your heart that God raised him from death. God will accept you and save you, if you truly believe this and tell it to others.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9-10‬ ‭CEV‬‬ ⬆️ believe in what u prayed for and live for God not this world cause this life is short and if you live for God u will have eternal life in heaven but don’t believe in him mentally but live for him and start reading his word repent which means a change of mind🙏🏽
I was watching this eating fresh white rice, morning star beef crumbles smothered in garlic chili sauce and soy sauce. The rice was hot and hiring my moth with the chili but I still burned my mouth eating it because I was shoveling it in as I watched Matt shoveling it in 😂♨️
Make sure to burn off those calories

How does he do it?  When I was at my biggest I couldn't even handle an extra lage pizza to myself. Now that I'm a type 1 diabetic, I can't even have one slice of pizza. I would love to be able to have one slice good pizza :* (
How was the pizza tho ? Which one was better ? Lol
I eat 10 pieces of mozzarella sticks and I blow up but this guy can eat a WHOLE pizza and look the same ?
They have a thirty inch near me that I am really tempted to try now... Black olive and mushroom has been my favorite pizza, shared by no one ever, since I was like 3 years old
I won't be writing any comment for this video !
Either Matt works out for 23 hrs a day or he has a fricking fast metabolism
I cant even eat a little ceasar pizza in 5 mints bro wtf😯😯
Anyone else wondering how his stomach fits that much pizza without popping
The dislikes are the people who had to cook the pizza
This man could have caused world hunger if he was obese
Perhaps one of the worlds greatest mysteries is how the hell Matt is so skinny
10 out of 10! I literally started clapping. Then I realized you couldn't hear it.
Corona ?       Mask🤔
I wanna see a matt stonie workout video and what he does soooo bad😄
اذا في عربي يثبت وجوده بلايك
I wonder if one of the pizzas were 18 inches what would he do maybe he would go back and return it and a 20 inch pizza
Basically took a pound a minute. Smh.
Nobody:  Matt stonie: “I’m actually quite hungry.”
This gotta damage your body.
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism.
what suprises me is not the time its the green cups from 6 years ago and the iconic music
why was this recommended to me? this is unhealthy shit

WARNING: DON'T READ   .     A boy asked a girl in a library, "Do you mind if I sit next to you?" The girl replied with a loud and angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you !! All the people in the library started looking at the boy and felt embarrassed. After a few minutes the girl calmly walked to the boy's table and said: I study psychology and I know what the man is thinking, I guess you felt embarrassed huh? The boy replied loudly: $ 500 for one night That's too much! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the boy whispered in her ear "I study laws and I know how to make someone guilty ...    🤭 If you like the comment, "write" on my channel ...

Beast mood
This should be a 10 year anniversary pizza challenge
how is he so skinny
Imagine If everyone had his metabolism
It’s takes me five min to eat half a pizza 😂
as soon as the camera turns off he probably goes and drinks 4 bottles of pepto bismol
*When you eatin the pizza before your siblings arrive*
this is so impressive
18 minutes is impressive for average eaters,  but for Matt it is bad
Mushroom and olives..lol. That was smart😋
Imagine He Does This Ever 10 Years And Then He Does It Under 20 Second Next Time
Wait he’s 28!? Bro you’re 20 stop lying
next food challenge should be 5 burrito bowls from chipotle
Omg yeah it is!!! 18 minutes is astonishing  of course you have a stretchy stomach sooooi
You should do Joey's Challange from Friends and eat one whole turkey.
Was that 2nd one Pizza K?
For April fools he should eat the slowest time possible.
Good stuff by boi!
God bless this man’s stomach
HALF AND HALF!!!!
You should go eat at a buffet
FYI there are people dying of hunger in the other parts of this planet...just saying
2010 was a decade ago? ffs i am 20 and already feeling old...
I mean could u pick any worse toppings lol looks terrible 😂
Teacher: no eating in the back of the class Kids in the back of the class :

Moar videos
I thought I was doing something when I ate a 5 pound Chicago style pie
You should try eating a pizza from lazy moon in under 5 minutes
Should've done all 3 and tried to beat your old time.
Matt needs to change his channel name to old man stonie
Noooo de merch ain't shipping to the Netherlands i am so sad 😞  😢. Keep up the good work though 👏 👍
All i can think is that you must have the most impressive shits in history!
Think about the amount of olives this guy consumed 😭
Does the scale read the highest weight? Because you dropped that pizza on the scale....
Thank you for the content over all these years
God bamn matt you a goat that was crazy i takes me 5 min to finish 2 slices thats nuts

Or like 20 pb sandwiches 10 chunky 10 smooth
New challenge can u eat 6 loafs of whole wheat bread
“Lol so apparently my Youtube recommendation brought me here and I stumbled upon this and shocked this dude’s still got a channel. For those of you who don’t know it yet this guy’s a FAKE! Don’t you guys ever wonder why he never shoots these videos with an audience? Look him up in Guinness World Records, you won’t find him.”
I appreciate your content...but where is your face mask? 😥😥 Happy content is finding out Matt didn't get Corona..
I said it time and time again but Honey is a literal scam. It never lets me check out after applying the codes, I straight up can't shop. It's garbage.
I’m confused where does this dude live like he’s always filming at different houses?????
Stonie stuffing serious slices swiftly   Sorry I'm stoned
wtf... crazyyy this Bay Area guy
The reason why he isnt fat is because when he eats fast it is a workout
That looks so good.Who else agrees 👀 👀 🤤
12min11sec progress 😎
Crazy!!!!
Wow :D
Mat Stonie if your seeing this make a TF2 food challenge.I don't know what it would be but just do it plz
Lol you can only eat three pizza boxes?
I definitely thought he was about to crush all 3 of those pizzas
That looks like the best tasting pizza ever.
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
куда в него столько лезеееееет????
Could it be that the company went out of business for offering  competitive eaters free pizza for a year??
Do you ever enjoy any of the food you consume?
Would of thrown it away olives and mushroom are trash
This guy can battle against his own shadow and still win
I wonder if he has to make himself puke after ever challenge or if he's just going to die of a heart attack in a couple years/months/hours
the reason thse take so long because in between not uploading he doesnt eat and the hunger just builds up
I am a fan
Is it just me, or do I question whether cam quality in 2010 was THAT bad?
i bet he could destroy the record for biggest shit.
I wonder wwhat 8 year old matt stonie was like

What a beast bro all those pizzas look great,this got me Jonesing for a pizza. His intro about his younger self is pretty funny.
If anyone seeing this hasn't accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, Please Come home before it's too late lovelies! 🙏💞 John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. God is loving and literally true Love; God loves us and wants us not to perish but have everlasting (eternal) life! You don't have to go to Hell it was mean't only for the devil and his angels, but when you don't choose God you automatically (even if you don't realize or mean it) choose the opposite, which is the devil, that's just how it is, and the devil and his minions fates are sealed which is why he wants to bring as many people down with him before he enters his eternal punishment/torture in the lake of fire and brimstone (with his minions/followers). BUT THERE'S HOPE FOR US(the way to God)! And that way and hope is Jesus! | John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. | Heaven is open for all through, and ONLY through Jesus Christ! Jesus is the doorway to the Father (who house is Heaven !) God gave us instructions in how to accept him which is accepting Jesus, so again you do not want to miss out on this FREE GIFT FROM GOD then ACCEPT JESUS IN YOUR HEART TODAY! We are not promised tomorrow! 🙏💕                                                               that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved Romans 10:9 🙏   Q: What must I do to be saved?  A: If you’re asking this question, you’re not far from salvation. Getting saved is a blessed gift from God!  First of all, it is important to realize that  there is only one way to God, and that is through Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior of the world (John 14:6). The Word of God says if you believe with your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, and confess Jesus as your Lord, you will be saved (Romans 10:9-10).  Romans 3:23-24   23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.  There is a Heaven to gain, and a Hell to shun!  Salvation is a free gift that God offers us because of His unconditional love through the sacrifice Jesus made in our behalf: “But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners” (Romans 5:8).  That should remove any doubts about being worthy to be saved. Salvation is not something we deserve, nor is it something we can earn. It is a gift that was purchased and paid for by the blood of Jesus. Through the cross, God laid the punishment for our sin on Jesus so that we might have right-standing with God through faith in Him (2 Corinthians 5:21).  Jesus was our substitute. He took the pain, penalty and punishment for our sin so that God could freely offer us salvation from our sin (Isaiah 53:3-5). “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).   that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved (Romans 10:9)  God does not hold the wrong things you’ve done against you. You still need Jesus to be saved, Right now, you can make a decision to receive Jesus into your life by following these steps:  1. Believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that He was raised from the dead.  2. Accept Jesus as your Savior and proclaim Him Lord of your life.  If you desire to do this right now, pray the following prayer out loud and mean it with all of your heart:  “Heavenly Father, I come to You in the Name of Jesus. Your Word says, 'Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved' (Acts 2:21). I am calling on You.  “I pray and ask Jesus to come into my heart and be Lord over my life according to Romans 10:9-10: ‘If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved.' 'I do that now. I confess that Jesus is Lord, and I believe in my heart that God raised Him from the dead.  Take more of me Lord, Give me more of you, I give you full control of my life, YOUR will be done in my life, thank you for saving me. I receive the Holy Spirit, Come live in me, Seal me, in the name of Jesus!   “I am now reborn!  I am a Christian—a child of Almighty God! Jesus is the Lord and savior of my life, I am saved, AMEN!” . You need to grow in Relationship with Jesus! don't just pray a prayer and live as you used to, Get baptised and follow Jesus not the world dearies! Heaven and Earth will pass away but the Word will never pass, Follow Jesus through it all! Endure till the end and you shall be saved!🤗💞
So what do you do after you finish these challenges, sleep? I would be good and out.

R u even a human
Any contact with female is the dystopian/shambles road to babies guys.Be careful of the Subliminal man-woman msg in movies,vg,music,tv,books and thank goodness for animal kingdom to annihilate the latter. Andrew Jackson 2ne greatest president(behind Lincoln)? only one to return banks from shadowy organizations to American hands? Mystery science theater 3000 new seasons released : Truly extraordinary my Moonrakers of this achievement of men. All comedy is sucked away by 51% of the world's population whose goal is replication of humans, not creativity, want to disintegrate dreams of the 49% and are an enemy of all creative arts including animation. Need to be herded in correctional facilities to figure out how to deal with these actual walking viruses. Spy/secret agents need to reevaluate their focus and annihilate. Need to get torn up by animal kingdom. Movies with humans have the hero and girl trying to get with each other. They even include animals assuming human characteristics of that man-woman nonsense. Be careful of what gets brainwashed into your subconscious from this. Watch out for hole guys. The romance angle (romance(tm) is too much a term for this) is handled charmingly/cutesy but all of this is like aw man here we go with this stuff. I know this movie spiderman ffh is showing guidance to males how to deal with females. All imagination shown in this movie, creativity is the male ability, while females are replication of humans (aka babies) so both goals are contrasts with each other and know if you stick it in their hole your creativity goes swoosh disintegrates, you fall inline with patriarchy which is uncompromising. Replication is them celebrating the debauchery of humankind while creativity is trying to get closer to God (creating imaginative things.) Any contact with female is the road to babies guys. Even the cutesy way movie dalliances are portrayed. I cant provide all the know-how on the matter, what can I state here that someone else hasn't figured throughout the thousands of yrs of human knowledge. They want to grind up men but it is I who grind them into fine dust. Wear pink to take their power away? I get it's hormones, just j/o in toilet or napkin. Also virtually all pawrn skyanks have baby shyts they keep secret from clients/viewers to upkeep pristine fantasy. Nintendo Mother/Earthbound textbook to be released wee- BApiano
I would love if all the popular food competitors would get together and battle. We are talking Raina, randy Santel, Joel, molly, Mitch etc. we all know who the gamers are.

How about a link to your old video?
His digestive system must be fucked

Mountain Mikes pizza is on my top 3 list of best pizza...and ive lived in the west coast, east coast and the south

WOW A NEW RECORD!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lol funny when he said go that dude swallowed it lmao
my bet is on matt stonie to win
Oh my god that was so fast
(6:36) thanks me later
I sort of do the same thing, it's all assumption though concerning what he does but what I do is I eat a collosal meal every 3 or 4 days. & I litterally eat nothing between every colossal meal. Like I fast for 4 days after eating like 4 large meatzas or something. I do a lot of cardio though & I have clear visible abdominals. I assume that's what he does to keep his lean stature. Also, by the way, his jaws are superb from all the chewing he does so that's that.
Not human bruhhh
Matt Stonie the eater cheater hahahaha
Oh my God how can you eat like that 😨
I'm watching this video at 1:35 am morning.

JESUS IS COMING Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin  GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!! HIS COMING BELIEVE AND TRUST IN HIM TODAY  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY

Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of payment cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this. Here is my invite link:  https://initiativeq.com/invite/S_AoIXIQT
Sometimes I feel sorry for Morgan. the man just sits behind the camera watching him eat and demolish it.

6:55 Thanks me later
Wtttf
Matt, you should do a Q&A and just eat casually while you answer all the questions. So your audience can finally know: - How you prepare to eat such big meals? - What it's like digesting/after eating? - Do you ever eat normal meals or are they all huge? etc. (Like this comment so we can get content like this. These questions need answers!!!)
Just wait for the punchline. You'll laugh. It's worth 3 minutes https://youtu.be/SN5GjLnW2SY
He was dancing it means he is switching his stomach😂
Does he ever compete? I'd love to see him do actual competitions and do more meet ups with other eaters and do collabs 😁

Bruh when I born I 6 pounds 10 ounces
The pizza would've been around 7 when you took the box out prolly
Bro I had no idea u were from my home town that’s so dope
That looks so good 🤤
Inhaling the challenge is cheating, Matt. :P
10 years before: 18 minutes  Now : 5 minutes  10 years later : 30 seconds 😂😂
This man really breaks the laws of physics right before my eyes.
He's an African kid in a Parallel Universe
Am i gone crazy cuz I feel like i got the smell of the pizza its smells so good😶😶
I am craving pizza now.

Girlfriend's got your wallet in mind.  She's got your back... pocket.
Imagine Matt gets into an unlimited buffet restaurant Manager : ah shit! Here we go
I Just Wanna Know How Did He Stay Skinny ! I Eat A Burger & Gain 10 Pounds.
I can understand breaking your own record but from 18 minutes to under 6 minutes? That's witchcraft
Stonies at 2020 : Stonies at 2030 : ok guys i want to challenge back the old me... Can i finish it under 3 minutes?
These pizza places definitely got more calls after this vid dropped😂
Now eat all 3 pizzas as fast as you can.

I think no one  invites you in wedding!!!
this dude doesn’t have a stomach in him he has a blackhole in him
We all know what that scale is really for “stonie”😏😏
Matt earned more than my respect today not because he's destroying himself and this delicious Pizza but because I hate mushrooms on Pizza and then there's the champion and he didn't even add meat or any other veggie. Wonder if I can purchase his merch using Honey with a discount?
Dakoa sa tubol ani malibang hahahaha
I would love to see him and  Molly Schuyler battle against each other.
He's 28? I'm at that age where I assume everyone is 22 or 23.
Give me 100k$$ I’ll eat a 20” pizza 7lbs with box please try me 🤣

He makes pizza 🍕 look so good
Its more than ur stomach
HOLY CRAP I MISS U
Mountain mike's pepperoni pizza is delicious with their house ranch sauce. As far as pizza chains go, theu're my 2nd favorite, only bested by Round Table.
2010 stonie has left the chat...
You put them out of business! 🤣🤣🤣
Challenge idea: Do the ice cream cake that Unus Annus tried eating ;)
Teacher: no eating in the class The kids in the back of the class:
🚽🚽🚽🚽

OMG! I tried to avoid watching this video but Matt that pizza just looks ridiculously delicious. Now I wan pizza. Great vid bro👍
I live for this Matt!! Really want to see you slaughter more of your old records.

Mushroom and olive is the best pizza topping combo ever!
Go to pizza factory!!! They make a pizza as big as a wagon wheel!
Takes me to finish a slice in 6 mins

*Matt gagging on food is so funny to me!*
Matt stonie 2020:" do you even eat???." Matt stonie 2010:" goddamn."
What would take for this man to actually enjoy his food...
https://youtu.be/6RFXLYjFUBM  Probably you can eat faster than him but you definitely can’t eat bigger than him
10 years later.... 3 seconds... Finished
very impressive but who TF orders a mushroom and olive pizza??? ew
u are definitely amazing,u look like a abyss
Stay safe bro cna i get a heart???....
His ego must've been broken but repaired but better
I'm surpised he is skinny
No offense i watch matt stonie only for to crave and order something
I im really intrigued does he goes to the doctor like regular and spends a shit tone of money on it or he just trash his stomach and muscle everything he eats
I ate a pizza in 23 seconds but then I thought about it and Matt can prob eat 3 in 23 secs
Hell yeah, 5.54 awesome 🤟
He has eaten 3 slices of big size pizza in 30 sec, me took 1 minute how to hold the pizza properly
can you do 10,000 THC edibles challenge
4:53 how Chuck E. Cheese makes their pizza
The ad and talk about the “merch” was just as long as the clip from eating the pizza. If it takes just 5 minutes to eat the pizza then why fast forward through the entire thing? The entire point if the video was about eating the pizza...
Someone said that the biggest challenger of yours is you yourself
Bro destroyed his old time by a mile
What do you do afterwards? Take a long nap, not eat for the rest of the week, or puke it all out?
I love how he put the old music from his old videos into this video as well!!!! Makes me so happy
He ate a whole pizza quicker than I can eat 1 slice
How he is insane
I skipped 10 sec and 2 slice of pizza was disappeared
NOW REDO THE FAILED KFC EPIC MEAL TIME CHALLENGE!!
Bagi yg bisa bahasa Indonesia baca ini     Saya makan 1 potong pizza aja udah kenyang
Merk Millions Martial Arts. YouTube.
my respect for you went higher than the initial respect I had lmao
Ten years and still skinny as a rail😳 how he do that .
Fake ! Why does he need to speed up all his challenges. Even the Travis Scott 1 min challenge is sped up. Won't believe him until he does a real time video.
How this guy can eat an all manor of different amounts of food and still be in shape is alien to me
i thought he would've folded the pizzas together and eat it like a burger lol
The fact that he ate all of that without hot sauce makes me feel frustrated.
Imagine he goes to your house for a sleep over and makes himself a snack.
I always wonder if u throw up all that food after
chug a gallon of salsa lol
I'd love to see a Joel Hansen vs Matt Stonie vs Joey Chestnut YouTube face-off.
how does all that fit in your stomach??
Try the premium pizza bundle from pizzauni, even though they sold out for months I’m sure they’ll send you some Za
Do you purge after the camera goes off?

Pizza must have sucked if they shut down
Me: I’ll give him 10 minutes 👌🏾  Beats it in under 6 😳 wtf
Dang! It's a new record 🔥🔥
is he ever going to donate food?
I wonder why he is not fat but he skinny?
I am sorry to say. But 1 hour.. is too easy. I can eat that whole pizza in under 45 minutes probably. So I get the refund for the pizza and pizza for free for a year?? Tooo easy. Thats probably why they are out of business.
Wait wait wait. This guy just ate 6+ pounds of food and barely has a bump on his stomach.Thats like having a baby .-.
He dusted 18mins wow!
make a sushi challenge please!
I ate 15 pieces of pizza,  some breadsticks, half a bag of chips, a couple handfuls of pork rinds, a quarter of a steak hoagie, some Italian bread, and 3 pop tarts in one sitting last night.  I could totally kill that pizza in one sitting.
https://youtu.be/hxc9Ibmtqdw
Who else wants to see Matt stonie actually enjoy his food?
“May the best Matt Stonie win “. What y’all don’t know is that 35 year old Matt Stonie bet 2020 Matt
Give me 5 hours and I’ll eat 1/4 of that
Bro 5 slices MAX, I'd be stuffed and bloated to shit!

Do a video of you eating an ice cream cake but you have to use a fork or spoon
2010 stonie didn't know it was a competition
Dear friends, Jesus Christ comes first for He deserves first place over EVERYTHING in our lives. Jesus is above and over all. “He is before all things, and in him all things hold together” (Col. 1 : 17). Jesus is supreme over all creation (vv. 15-16). He is “the head of the body, the church” (v. 18). Because of this, He should have first place in all things.            Jesus deserves the best of our time, energy, and affection. When we give Jesus the highest place of honor in each area of our lives, this truth becomes visible to those around us. At work, are we laboring first for God or only to please our employer? (3 : 23). How do God’s standards show up in the way we treat others? (vv. 12-14). Do we put Him first as we live our lives and pursue our favorite pastimes?                                          When Jesus is our greatest influence in all of life, He will have His rightful place in our hearts. Dear one, place Jesus first in your life by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Welcome Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. You will then be sealed in salvation and blessed abundantly. Your life will be forever changed!           Please pray the following prayer with me...Dear Lord Jesus, You deserve the best of my time, energy, and affection. I crown You King of my heart and Lord over everything I do. Help me to always trust You and put you first in every aspect of my life because I know Your way is the BEST way! Thank you Lord, this I pray in Your Mighty Mighty name, Amen!        May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️
Do 40/50 Corn Dogs!
bro I cant even finish my chocolate milk
that corona cough at the end tho.
6:35
He should do one in ten years
Imagine the shit he takes after all of these challenges
i’m pregnant and the only reason this isn’t triggering cravings is because the mushrooms and olives are triggering nausea 😂🤮
He’s probably never thought of this but he’s probably going to have stomach ulcers when he’s 30
Omg that was crazy
I’m glad you have more pizza you can enjoy later! Looked like yummy pizza!
You should meet up with these YouTube eater and eat with them so we can see how much better you are
These stunts are performed by professional. Don't try this at home or else you can be chocked to death..😂😂😂
If you put olives on ur pizza ur a demon idc what you say
That would last me atleast 3 good days😁
ah shit here we go again
Gilaaaa
10 years from now you got to beat that time
“ almost perfect other than the fact it’s two pizza mashed together “ .... Chuck E. Cheese: I see no issues with this
He showed mercy
He finished more then half of the pizza faster then it would take me to eat 1 slice😂
In 10 years you’ve improved yourself by 3X congrats
it hasn’t even been 30 seconds and he’s already finished half of the pizza 🤣💀
https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk

I got a heartburn watching this
I swear he loses weight when he eats 😂
Video starts at 6:55
Competitive eating is basically just swallowing food as quick as possible I don’t understand why people get so pressed that he doesn’t chew the food
How are u so thin
Damn... That was impressive
Fucking champ! I love the intensity in his face as he chomps the pizza haha
You should see how fast u can eat a box of snack cakes
You da man
Stonie never talks bad about people that do bad on food competition he says they did great lets see if we can beat the high score hes not a$$whole
Does he barf after he eats all that food because he does not gain weight at all
6:37 if ur impatient
What is your workout
Pizza: "Ah sh*t, here we go again"
Stonie is a beast💪
How do you stay skinny
WHO IS WATCHING THIS IN 2020
Speaking of Merch. I always thought It would be a good idea to have a custom shirts made that you wear during your videos with your top subscribers or donators on it so they can see their names on your shirt in your videos. Just a random thought.
I LIVE IN SANTA CLARA WTFFF
ᴀʜᴀʜᴀʜᴀʜ ʏᴏᴜ'ʟʟᴇ ʙᴇᴀᴛ ʏᴏᴜʀ ᴏʟᴅ ʀᴇᴄᴏʀᴅ ʜᴀʜᴀʜᴀʜᴀʜᴀ
I could never eat that, there are to many olives I would have to take all of them off
Matt Stonie: eating a big ass pizza. Me: bring back the pineapple!
Yo my man how do you stay soo skinny?? Can you give me some tips to loose weight. Maybe show us your workouts?
"I'm Matt Stonie, and I just kicked my ass"

Where’s ur mask matt

Even though I love pizza I can only eat 2 slices of that...... Sad Lyf :(
I’m the same age as you when you went to do it for the first time lol. Guess ima go be Matt stonie😳
I was eating pizza while watching this
Would it be faster to get the pizza cut in half then fold the halves like a taco and eat them separately
At first My Friend told me about Matt Saying that he ate 5000 Calories of food and I thought he was a body builder and Little did I know..
“Merch”
Why am I watching this at 3 Am again ?
How about a ice cream cake for one of the challenges? 🎂
Nice job dude! Absolutely awesome

Matt ate half his weight in pizza lol.
Very Impressive! Stonie coming back to lay the smack down on his naysayers! 💪🏆🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
The 18 year old Stonie reminds me of a beggar in an old Chinese kongfu TV show.

Yea, 18 mins ain’t shit, younger Mattie!! Only 1lb of food every 3 mins?! Psshhhhh! I can do that with my eyes closed while I’m asleep, but literally in my dreams though... Not actually in real life. LMAO! That’s actually quite incredible to eat that much pizza that fast. Absolutely insane.
Congratulations on number 16 on trending
Can he still enjoy a normal meal after eating like this?

Still killing it after 10 years!
Mushrooms and olives though? Gross.

Oh man, I remember going to Mountain Mikes as a kid when I lived in CA. Glad to see they’re still around
Damn I gained 6lbs just watching this!
U should try to drink a water bottle the fastest
I just want to know how tf a pizza that big can fit in a stomach that small( ik the stomach expands but still)
اكو عرب بل فيديو 🌚😂
Why not the three pizzas? You can do it. 6min/p X 3 pizzas =18minutes.  Simple and easy for you Matt.
Next can you mukbang king crab @matt stone
Does he run a marathon after every video to stay in shape? XD
Nice speedrun
Dude!
God olives 🤢🤢🤢
Imagine he ate like that at pizza party
You're supposed to weigh each individual slice and then add them all up for an accurate weight cmon man
Me: can u save me a slice or two?  Matt: ok no problem   Me: BRO YOU DID NOT

Now I'm hungryb
Exluding anchovies, if someone asked me, "what two toppings do you NOT want on your pizza?" Olives and mushrooms would be it. Haha  Nice job, Matt! YOU weren't even your own competition!!
Nikocado needs to watch this channel. He slim after eating that large pizza
You rosted your self
Matt stonie before this: I am so excited! Matt stonie after this: I am still hungry, is there more😂😂!
Me: "I know this is gonna be fast and messy" Also me: "Don't touch the cup with dirty hands you monster"
I want this man's diet and workout plan(when not making gluttony demons deeply uncomfortable).
gunna wants a sample of pizza
So does he digest the pie, or purge later?
Cool show
🤩🤩🤩🤩😍 🍕
How do u not gain weight?
You're gonna come here 10 years later! Mark my word!
Nobody is gonna say anything about the olives? He's eating an olive pie with a little cheese and tomato sauce. I love olives, but I have my line.

Haven’t watched it yet, but my money is on Matt Stonie for the win! Any takers?

I used to work at Mountain Mikes and those mountain sized pizzas get heavier, Matt was being nice by getting two light toppings. Combination Mountain sized is like 10-12 pounds and cost like 40 dollars.

It's that spiderman meme where he's pointing at himself hahaha the only competition for me....is me!
Wow matt your awesome,you always beat everyone,EVEN YOURSELF!!
Watching at 1 am
Did anyone get a bit annoyed he didn’t zero the scale with an empty pizza box on it for true pizza weight
He is one of the only competitive eaters who looks like his weight has not and does not change at all. This is proof that Matt Stonie is infact an Extratestrial Simulation
Matt stonie:ill challenge you abuela  Abuela:are you full yet i still have more
Matt is probably grandma’s favorite grandkid. He can finish everything grandma gives him.
👍🏽💪🏽
سريع جداً
holy smokes you did that in 30% of your first time 🤯 dudes a legend
Dude you’re a beast 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤙🏻

In another dimension, Matt Stonie is looking at Matt Stonie saying "5:54:03...it's nothing to be proud of"
Matt is built DIFFRENT

R his videos fake ?
Who else thought he was going to eat all 3 pizzas?
God bless everyone god has a master plan for you
Should've just ate the 8lb one.
Might lose on weight, but Bibo’s wins on quality. Probably the best NY pizza in the Bay Area.
Well done Old Man Stonie.
that’s how my turtle eats food as well
Beginning of the video : Man Pizza does sound good.   End of the video : I dont even wanna look at pizza again.
How has he got skinnier over 10 years tho
You should try to drink everything from a sonic menu

Matt:I’m going for a quick snack a min  "Eats a 20lb steak"
The fact that the video is only 10 minutes long I already knew he beat his old time
he didnt eat the cardboard though dislike
Can you please see how many Panera sourdough bread bowls (no soup)  you can eat in 10 minutes?
Petition Matt to do all old video again👉

How much does this dude work out to have the same body shape for 10 years
If you ever come to India....you can try out the "THALI" which is sort of a combo with 18 types of delicious veg or non-veg dishes in a single plate with different sorts of bread,authentic sides,drinks and the one who finishes it alone would get a huge sum of money!!!TILL NOW NOBODY COMPLETED THAT CHALLENGE....YOU CAN SEARCH ON THE NET "BIGGEST THALI IN INDIA" AND YOU WILL GET THE DETAILS.....hoping to see you accept the challenge!!!!LOVE AND SUPPORT FROM INDIA!!!!

My biggest question is how has Matt not choked on anything
1:07 hurt me...
I think it’s safe to say. It’s been an amazing 10 years watching you Matt:)🙏
Boomer
Imagine if pizza was never created.
Some men say that you'll never be twice the man I'll ever be,    Well stonie, your 3x the man you once were
⁦❤️⁩⁦❤️⁩⁦❤️⁩

Destroyer Stonie  !!!!!
This man from mars.
Worst. Toppings. Ever.
PIZZA.      BH
No one:  Someone's bike before starting: 6:49
0:36 looks like a little boy
My birthday is June 20
Damn on my birthday
He probably could’ve eaten all three pizzas and still beaten 18 year old Stonie 😂
12.6 million subscribers. Holy sh@t.
Nobody gonna talk about how it was only mushrooms and olives... that’s like the 2 toppings I always say HOLD.
he has been gagging more recently i am worried for his health
Damn
Please go around the world smashing records.. Please
I forgot he eats like a wolf
Matt in 2060 : oLD mAn sTNonIe    6:17
There is no way Joey chestnut can eat a 6 pound pizza in less than 6 minutes
Doctor: You should chew your food at least...  Matt: Chewing was never an option.
I am actually suprised he didn't eat all 3 pizzas
Holy F******* **** you eat like a monster bro.
I life in europe and i have no idea what white thing this in the middle of the pizza is can someone explane me that?
What a coincidince,i just ate pizza
Less Morgan. He is insufferable
Omg he was so young
HEY I LIVE AROUND THERE
Just... how?!
Matt Stonie, should dress up as a conehead for halloween.
My jaw has got tired just by watching him eat like that
Old man stonie 😂
Wowowi nice bro fans hit like here. 👇
He kinda spoils that he breaks the time ,no lie
Road to 20mil
Pls eatt plssss
Why does Matt remind me of Brad Pitt.
At 18 years he looked 12.
Nobody:  Chuck E. Cheese: 5:05
dude shaved off 12 minutes and 54 seconds
Baby stonie
😋
Matt you should maybe try again for the Nathan’s hotdog contest. You’re in top form in this video
unfortunately your website is really hard to find without using the link in the description
Do u puke after these challenges?
Awesome 🤩👌
can you have Jeff Wittek cut your hair
What are you trading for??? You only did this for training, 6lbs jeeezzzzuusssss man
I’ve lost my appetite for my pizza
The noises 😭 I’m so glad there’s music
Honey is worthless everytime I try to use it it tells me I already have the best deal in my cart
doing these challenges at home doesn't count because he can just purge (vomit) right after finishing. Look back all his videos end when the food is gone never shows 10 min after the challenge. (I believe once the camera cuts he runs to the bathroom and pukes)
when the honey ad begins just click here to skip :) 2:41
the excited giggle at 7:22 was so cute
I know this is irrelevant but I just ate the best orange ever
I said about 5 minutes dang very close
You should make a all the fruits and Beth fable and a eating video
2010: 6 pounds of  pizza in 18 minutes.                 2020: 6 pounds of pizza in   6 minutes             2030: 6 pounds of pizza in no time !
This man his upgraded
I have one only question..How the Fck he can be still slim with all this food he is eating?
How does he eat so much without puking damn
Nobody: kids at the back of the class when the teachers aren’t looking
Does eating competitive interfere with you eating normal portions and be satisfied?
Definitely deserves to be popular. Dude eats food. News at 11... What a rebel and trendsetter....
Matt Stonie: aye I’m hungry intensely looks at pizza  Pizza: I’m sorry whatever I did I’m sorry  Also Matt Stonie: starts timer   Also pizza:Ahhhaahaaha
Belly Buster Pizza prob left b/c they knew Matt Stonie would be back..
1:11   of course they are out of business.....there mistake was giving people a year of free pizza
Wait you’re 28 ???!????!!!? I thought you were 25 this entire time!!
You know you’re a legend when you have to beat your own record😂
Pouce bleu 👍🏻 🔵
serious question pls answer.... does he throw up after each challenge?
Watch the original in 3x speed and it'll be just as fast as this one
Given all these comments, your merch should include toilet bowl accessories.

Old man stonie😔
I've lived in Santa Clara my whole life for 20 years. I have never heard of belly buster LOL.
I forgot an olive
Nothing more Sunday-ish than watching Matt Stonie hork down a pizza. Great Job.
In 2030  Marvel's Avengers vs Matt Stonie
When will matt fall victim to food challenges
Collab w/ badlandschugs when
Skip Ad: 2:40
He could eat this big 4$$ Pizza 2 times while you’ve been watching this video... think about it
Seeing this man devour 6 pounds of pizza that quickly gives me the same existential dread as reading Lovecrafts work
You made good time, but how did the pizza taste?
OMG, the 2 nastiest toppings that you could ever order on any pizza. Ewwww! But great job on time.
Matt, just enjoy the food for once. Gosh!
Whenever i watch your videos i feel hungry😋😋😋lots offf luvvv from Indiaaa😘❤😘
3:55 American tape measures are weird as fuck lol
Damn son your 28?
when there’s no competition so he has to compete against his past-self
This mans shit doesn’t fit down his toilet
Matt stonie's the reason Thanos snapped
Can you use metric system pls
He finishes every single piece of food on the challenge..
Someone please inform NASA that the blackhole is nowhere else, but in Matt's belly 😝😝
<<<<<<     FAKE/FRAUD! HEAVILY EDITED, WENT OUT OF SCREEN SO MANY TIMES!  LIKE IF U AGREE HES A FRAUD!    >>>>>
Fun fact: You are less likely to have children, if your biological parents didn't have children
I thought I'll be seeing the old video after this one I thought wrong 😢
2020 : maxed ability matt stonie

Moly schulyer coat tail riding....
I though that he was gonna try to beat it by like a minute or 2....but no...😂😂
I know his 💩 are crazy man sheeesh
Toad throath
Can’t wait for 2030 when you inhale this thing whole

Gotta have that fiber
Matt stonie is now 10% pizza
شييت
At the end I was hoping it would switch to ur brother eating the rest of the pizzas... maybe next time? ;D
i literally blinked and the pizza was gone
You are legend matt stonie. 🤗🤗
He eats at 6:55, thank me later
10:02 “you suck, You suck, deez nuts”
im down for this being a new series. Super Saiyan Matt Vs Super Saiyan God Matt: The Movie The Game Deluxe
I always watch his videos after 2am when I am really hungry
Not a guy to invite to a pizza party
can you please start making aftermath videos, I am very interested in what you do or how you feel after pounding 6 pounds of food
Matt: it doesn’t get more cleaner than that   Randy Santel would’ve licked the box clean 😁
Look at all those likes!
try crackers challenge
Nice, keep improving yourself!
He got no competition so he competes with himself 😂
I dare you to not fast forward a video
I wonder if he ever gets to enjoy the food
Eat your heart Chestnut, #TeamStonie 🤙🍻💪
Have you ever bit your tongue in the middle of a challenge?
I would probably hate pizza after this 😂
$70 for international shipping on the merch bro? imma cry :(
“Get your name immortalized on the wall of fame” Pizza Wall of fame goes out of business
Re attempt the kfc full meal pls
I don't believe that Matt stonie. Videos are real because he eats so much and doesn't get fat
Its Now Been 10 years So Probably you Are 28 years Old And Your Belly Should Increase 🙂🙂🙂
shouldeve done 3 pizzas at once
By 10 years from now these 3 pizza franchises would definitely be closed just like 'Pizza Party'. Watching this video fear that Stonie will return after 10 years not to eat pizza but  F(_)@K pizza 😂
Matt Stonie: I’m the best eater ever.     Joey Chestnut from the MrBeast Pizza video: I’m about to end this mans whole career.
not bad not bad
Matt is a different breed
Very cool
You did that when I was 2 damn that was a while ago.
I watch matt ads always because i fear that he'll eat me if i dont
Matt Stonie 2030  - let's use seconds !!!
10:03
This must be unhealthy ! Tremendous!
The fact that some of us doing the same thing that is matt stonie doing this video super!!
Wow
Insane haha
6 lbs less then 6 mins. INSANE.
This is the vidoe https://youtu.be/DaQ0C-yk13A thank me later
bro
You should weigh yourself before and after the challenge
Bro, a whole pizza in under an hour?? I call that a low-carb Saturday.
Finally Matt posted
This guy eats like how people have the munchies after smoking weed
I went toilet and when I came back the video was already finished
Ohhhhhh snaaaappp 10 years back into the future to fix the present by going back to the past && ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh😂
This guy never eats normally
So will he eat it in a second after 10 years in 2030 🧐😅
How are you not fat
Should've weighed the empty box to be absolutely sure. Could always have eaten a slice of that NY pizza. That thing looked goood
How tf do u poop man?
I bought a sticker pack lol
New challenge idea i ate a whole horse
He recorded his first challenge in my 5th birthday.
Dude nice challenge but also take care of ur health
This is unbelievable 😳
ur beautiful ✨☁️💫⚡️🌙 ✰
Olives 🤮🤮
Song name at 6:52?
I got acne just by watching this vid
i think the greatest comment section of any youtuber is matt stonie 😂
3:17 "Yeah, that weighs 20 inches too"
just  one thing want to know, why is he not fat🤯
How does this guy not weight 800+ pounds ? I feel like laws of eating and being fat doesn’t apply to him.
i looked at the comments for 10 seconds and half the pizza was gone tf
He eats like a teridactal eating it's lettuce!
What about the rest of the other pizzas?
don’t you ever just wanna see this man enjoy a meal slowly
Beyond amazing my friend.. a 6lbs pizza in 5:54...  you are a legend👌🏽
The dislikes on this video are from those who aren't completely satisfied that it wasn't EXACTLY 6LBS.
Legend says he will never get fat
How are you not dead
Og’s remember mega toad
I told my mom Matt ate a 6 pound pizza in 5:54 seconds and she’s like “he must be feeling sike and suicidal” 💀💀
Dude wtf, you're stomach is processing that quicker than my mind can, bravo, bravo, bravo.
This is how many times he said 10 years in this video  || v
I wouldn't be surprised if he ate my family afterwards
Anyone wonder how he eat as a kid
You should've weighed the pizza with the box and then taken the pizza out to weigh the box alone. That way you subtract the weight of the box. Now you didn't match the weight unless you eat there box
0:28 he looks so small
Did he just roast and challenge his past self?  😂😂
“BE HONEST WHO'S BEEN A FAN FOR A LONG TIME?”  “¡ᴍ ɢɪ🄵T̶ɪɴɢ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏöꪀᴇ ᴡʜo ꒒ɪᴋᴇꇙ ᴀɴᴅ sᴜʙŞ ᴛᴏ ᴍᴇ”🎁 let me know when you do and what you want
Go wAtch beard meets food this guy got nothing on him
he just ate a baby weight
I thought only gods could eat this quantity
The true difference between 2010 stonie and now... he actually showed us him eating the stuff. This video was less than 2 mins of eating. The other 8 was mostly plugged merch and sponsor. If your eating stunt only takes 6 mins why not leave it all in? Get the extra view time and viewers don't feel cheated by your constant fast forwarding...
My brain: BRUH HOW ARE YOU SO SKINNY   Matt: ..............
How does he stay skinny
WTF HE’S 28
I can't wait to see 2010 you respond to this....
#samueldodge.dk
Imagine this that pizza place went out of business , when they kept giving Matt free pizza that year he beat the challenge
Do a any challenge and after one hour do another challenge,it will be interesting.Take a look of it
Mountain Mike’s needs to step up their perforation game! Thanks for the awesome video my friend.
This is obviously easier because the crust isn't the same girth for each slice
6lb and 5min 54s daaamn thats like 1.5 pc a min
How you know someone’s successful  They have a phone with one purpose  Timer ⏱
Chuck-E-Chesse be like: 4:56
Oh my God.. that was scary to watch 😨
This man is saying he eats five times the calories of what Dwayne Johnson eats in a day
No wonder they went out of business, when Matt won 1 year of free pizza 🤣
Who else trying to promote their channels doing this pandemic💛 let’s help each other grow?
Hello🖐🖐
12.5m subs and you use an off brand tape measurer to prop up your phone on the counter. Haha
had to reach that 10min mark lol
Watching this at 3.00 wasn't a good idea! I am starving as hell!
He broke the system and the law by putting 2 halfs of different pizzas and put them togethr
Wait you're 28?!
I wonder does he actually ever enjoy his food
Matt Stonie in 2030: Stonies pizza now open
Pizza box weighs 1.7 ounces
If restaurants did this and Matt  would get free food & drinks And see the weight his belly is the same as before!
1 pizzas omg my stomach is saying omy
10 years later he eats its above any normal time, so freaking fat. Me 10years later eat 3x slower than before :D
me when i have 5 minutes left on my break
Why would he choose the nastiest ingredients on a pizza lol that's impressive itself
Maske nerde
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can you imagine why this pizza store get bankrupt?     Looking at 18 year old boy, getting free pizza.
For what is that lil chair in the middle of the Pizza?
Damn
This guy never get fat bro lol.
what did i just see???
Is stonie a stoner?
Matt: *destroys a huge pizza in under 6 minutes* Me: *barely finishes a medium pizza in 45 minutes*
Only matt stonie can beat matt stonie
Stop stretching when ur done eatting please you can die from that
You know Honey is really doing? It's taking all your information and selling it to 3rd party companies. Good stuff
Imagine accidentally biting your tongue :/
Nobody:  Literally Nobody:  Matt Stonie when he says he's Hungry: KIRBYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I still see olives on the box, FAIL YOU LEFT FOOD BEHIND, NEW TIME DOES NOT STAND!
I'm so hungry 😂😂😂
Does he ever get full
Y yo aqui comiendo arroz solo😑
10 years later....
LOL...i was hauling
Legend says matt had a huge role in them shutting down
i could do the same thing this man is doing and get full but wouldn’t gain a single pound and still be skinny
Can eat a shit ton of food in 1 sitting.  Physically doesn't age once he's reached adult form. Grunts during intense moments. I think stonie is a Saiyan.
Destroying baby Stonie time.  Cali pizza does not  compare. to NY pizza.
:
2010 matt : 18 minutes thats pretty good    2020 matt stonie: 5 minutes 2010 EAT IT
How come this guy is in Great shape even after eating like thousands of Calories of Food..... !!!!
He finally did itt
You have chosen the correct pizza toppings
Me: hey that’s your 2010 pizza! Matt: EAT IT 2010. SUCK IT! Me:

This needs to become a series.
Imagine seeing Matt eating like this in a restaurant...
I would say he is gonna finish it a 5 :30
Honestly, finishing that Pizza under 1 hour is probably too generous. They should've made the rules set to under 20 minutes.
I don't even think a hungry pit bull could eat that in that time
olive/mushroom, nope. good job stonie
Matt's brain: **sends signal to chew the food**  Matt: *_Lemme take the liberty to ignore you_*
When he says “18” it reminds me of something else 😭
Honey is not avalible in my land......
Should have weighed the box after you were done.
I pray who ever reads this becomes successful in life
Waiting for the sub 1 minute record in 2030
Do u guys remeber morgan. With matt stonie
Challenge countdown starts at 6:50
*Food:* 'how much can you eat?' *Matt:* 'yes'
Pizza Bakers : It Takes 1 Day And 40 Min To Make A Pizza !  Matt Stonie : I Will Eat It In 5 Mins And Then Say Holy Crap!😂
Please revisit the Michael Phelps challenge next 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Do the happy meal from McDonald's again to see how much faster you are now
Me: **CRYING**  My FBI agent: **ALSO CRYING**  My hacker: **ALSO ALSO CRYING**

Girl: *Glad to meet you, what do you do in life?*  Matt Stonie: *I EAT QUICKLY*
Him half pizza left me closes eye hears done me wtf do u mean done opens eye finds him done and just walking
He inhaled a whole pizza in the time it takes me to eat three slices.

I wonder if it’s going to be like Disney movies now. He just does them all again just with a better camera.
nots sure but I think the new matt Stonie won
So do you eat normally off camera or do you just always eat like that
Can I buy a house and get a discount on it
Matt: Hey guys I'm here to renew my yearly pizza membership
Lmao I used to work at mountain mikes before the quarantine haha

I wonder how you eat so much and still never get fat
Me : (blinks my eyes)  Matt Stonie : Bam....done
I always try to compete against his video with my normal meal
Who is best?  Matt Stonie or Matt Stonie?
7:22 scarier than the demon in my dreams
Instead of giving yourself a real challenge and eating against Molly Schuyler, you challenge your younger* worse self. 👌
pizza always looks easy to eat.. as its so spread so thin, look like nothing, then you eat a few slices and like, yeah I am done.. I think I can eat that pizza, for breakfast, lunch and dinner, 12 hour easy :-)
A petition for Matt to record himself eat peacefully
The more u eat, the skinnier you get.
Nice Timing 👍
0:42 did you mean the *YOUNG* you??
Old man stonie
One week and another video? Are we coming back to the actual "this week's challenge"??

I found out his secret, he doesn’t eat for a week and does a new challenge
Let's go Old man Stonie! ^^

I literally went for some cup of coca cola , came back and he already finished a half of the pizza
This guy has the Bermuda Triangle in his stomach.

Anjay
Me just realizing he is 28 years old
Breathing food. Now I get what that means
Matt: eats a whole 6 pound pizza in minutes and still is skinny  Me:eats a pizza one slice gains 100 pounds

I calculated Matt stonie's age...
Poor Pizza Party. They could never recover financially after that day.
When this man eats cheeze pizza, cheese gets cholesterol.
https://youtu.be/Vj6-_dv1ZVw
i couldnt even eat a pizza like that in 2 hours
10 years older, 3x faster. Cheers!
How is Matt almost 30? He actually looks 18! What’s funny is that his 18 year old self looks 14!
I took me 3 to 4 minutes tp eat onelarge pizza slice 🙄 and he
Meanwhile I can’t finish two slices
Wow I didn’t know Matt was 28
Matt are you actually able to keep everything down afterwards? Or does it make a second appearance when the cameras are off ? Lol
I can’t even eat a single piece of pizza in that amount of time ;-;
Imagine making a food eating challenge for your future self, challenge your self in 10 years to beat your time haha
This is why America is so obese. We glorify gluttony. When your body starts having adverse effects, please don’t post your gofundme.
In 5 minutes i be choosing from wich side i start

The amount of shit he takes after this vid is done!🤪💩
If toilets would have feelings  Matt....ur toilet will be uhhhhhh.m....
-me taking a billion years to eat one freakin lime chip-  Matt: here here lemme shoe you the basics
But dude, "Stonie - Baked to perfection"  I know you've answered the stoner question but it's like you're trolling that

Try Indian style food ♠️🖤
Old Man Stonie is hysterical!
Well, he looks like the zombie eating the plant in Plants vs. Zombies. 🤔 🤔
My grandma disapproved of this
Matt stonie: eating a large pizza in 5 min Me having a small pizza: wow I gonna eat this in one min (after one bite  Me:nevermind about the speedrun
I aspire to be you <3
Those toppings are the worst why would you get such gross toppings😂
Hello, I am Giorgi from Georgia. My advice would be to eat the Georgian traditional dish "Khinkali" in the following video. Thanks in advance❤❤
No longer in business :(
Normal people: Woah this pizza so big it can feed a whole family Matt Stonie: If I'm family, then *yes*
have you ever bitten your hand?
Ik you're a pro & i appreciate your efforts mahn! but just for the sake of saying bro, be careful, when you eat so much stuff all at once together so fast there is a greater tendency to get 'choked' as food enters larynx! i trust your skills you've been doin this for years..but be careful! :')
What a beast 😳 let’s go
I have never seen a sharper jaw line than matt's
Matt stories biggest world record eats a cow 🐄 in 1 minute  woww Matt stone in future
Looks like the former Pizza Party is now an Asian eatery, I wanna see him do a challenge from that place!
This is crazy!!!
Where the hell do you put all of it? Is there an alternate universe in your stomach?
I regret watching this at 3:00am,  It's making me hungry

I want 5 minutes for 2 slices. How can you eat one pissa in 5 minutes... It is amazing!!
Eventually he will evolve and just open his stomach with a vacuum like Patrick.
Who's better? Like Matt Stonie. Comment Matt Stonie.
How does this guy do Ramadan???
6 pounds = 2,72 kg 20 inches = 50,8 cm
The fact that right now this whole pizza is in his stomach is fucking unbelievable.

Wonders if he beats the record, sees video is only 10 mins long
Measure twice, eat once

He digested the pizza while eating it
You should do the Greg Doucette 10000 calorie from hes anabholic cookbook challenge. He claims nobody can do it
Things you never want to hear when you host Matt Stonie for dinner: 5:55
If zombie apocalypse happens I'm staying away from where he live

I want to see matt stonie going around the US blowing through famous food challenges.
How is he so skinny
So he roasted his 10 year younger self?
I feel sorry for his food pipe 🙄!

DrippyOP

Matt's dumps have to be a world record on their own.
Aomine daiki is shaking!
Wonder how big his stomach😂
A 10 min vid about a pizza challenge with 3 mins of him actually eating the pizza, feel like I kinda wasted 7 mins now
Matt : let's break a record His friends: you own almost every record Matt : then let's break my own record
I hate olives Nd mushrooms 🤢

Let’s gooo

You weighed the pizza w them in them.......
10 years and you done it in 1/3 of the time of the original challenge. So that means in 2030 you will be able to complete the challenge in 2 minutes.

Matt should revisit the 14lb Big Mac challenge that he failed 7 years ago
"They're out of business" No shit, you cleared their whole stock with your one-year free pizza.🤣🤣
Matt ay a all you can eat buffet:

When you defeat all the bosses, and now you've become the final boss.
You know Stonie is serious when he doesnt talk and just eats.
why does matt love to give us his gagging moments? lmfaooooooo
"...that means that a single pig can consume two pounds of [food] every minute. Hence the expression, "as greedy as a pig". One pound per minute is impressive but you're not a pig yet!
Can you do the eggscellent challenge from regular show
4:45 Chuck e Cheese employees be like lmao
Plot twist. He began competitive eating because 2020 him came back in time and told him if he wants to unite the world he must become a legend and eat.

No wonder they went out of business...you have to eat that pizza in under an hour and you get free pizza for a year??? Lmfao...that’s not like crazy difficult

Matt Stonie beats the Belly Buster Challenge at Pizza Party and earns "free pizza for a year".  Shortly after Pizza Party goes out of business. Coincidence? I think not....

If you revisiting old challenges, how 'bout the 14lb "big mac" challenge? You would crush that now!     Petition to see Matt do the challenge! 👇🏻
No Matt I guess now you must stop eating so fast or else for sure you'll suffer through major chronic disease or maybe diseases because we know 50% digestion takes place in our mouth and you eat so fast you don't even let your food stay in your mouth and most of the severe diseases generate through our stomach so it's a request man I love you but now stop ❤rest your life your decision peace out ✌🤙
We cant even finish a single slice of that😂
You eat a lots of food right but why you don't get fat
Why do u eat like dogs everytime
Nobody  Literally nobody:Matt stonie exceeding before eating something
Its time, time to revisit the Cookie Bowl Ice Cream Challenge and see if you can beat it this time!
Who wants to have pizza now 👇
All I can keep repeating loudly is HOW!😅😂 id literally be stuck on my couch for days after all that

Stonie I really wanted merch but you don't have 2xl :(
6:15.... that part when he said "old man stonie" made me feel sad... idk why
When you're so good, you have to compete with yourself
Random fact:  You replace every particle in your body every seven years. You are literally not the same person you were 7 years ago.
Who wants to see Matt eating pizza slowly???
Matt stonie now: Yes I beat  Comes back 20 years later: 5 seconds! Let’s go!

*Matt Stonie* : *Always kept on eating a lot and fast .* *Me : Is he  a Human?*

You are jealous of mrbeast
*"Matt Stonie in 2050: eating my house challenge"*
First started watching when you did the Pho King challenge. I remember they made you eat absolutely everything because they didnt want to pay.
Second pizza is the only one that looks like normal pizza.
👍
Italiani? 👇
why you look the same 10 years ago? vampire
June 20th 2010 Matt was 18 Today he should be 28 or 29. I finally found his age. Dude looks younger than I thought
Who else wants honey to be for mobile too
I want to see him eat peacefully
7:03 my sisters eating my food infront of me like:
Rename this to destroying my digestive system
2020 matt stonie: finished at 5:53  2010 matt: am i a joke to you??
😟
People forget about Stonie. Molly, Joey, Geoff, and Joel should take notice.
Matt Stonie: I can’t wait I’m so hungry! Stomach: ah shit here we go again
oh dont mind me im just being nostalgic even if i havent seen his first vid just  from the story
Olives on a pizza....
Do 10kg oat chalenge.
Here in Italy it's just an ordinary lunch
My main takeaway from this vid... Took 10 years for Matt to start doing merch!
I'm sure there must be more than a few restaurants and fast food joints that refuse to let him do their challenges.
*hi*
Hey sir you forgot to chew your food 🧐🤓
18 minutes lmao, and then 1 minute and hes like already half way througj
hi matt howmuch is  your weight
Me wondering why tf the restaurant is open or why the lad doesn't have a facemask and shit

Dude is a "Beast"
This dood has to beat himself cuz no one else can
1:35 AYO YOU TOOK MR.BEAST SPONSOR 😂😭
I wonder if he’s gonna puke that pizza 🍕 out after the video. There’s no way this is healthy for your body if it hast du digest it
I remember watching that video haha, on your old account
So technically in the end Matt Stonie won
You should work at Chuck E. Cheese the way you rebuild that pizza
Nom nom
Imagine Matt stonie doing asmr food eating😂😂
This Filipino guy is awesome
Sometimes I feel like he is not human
Who elses screen was so clear when they pressed on the vid

Idk why;-; he never got sick...

You eat so much, but you are skinny, why?
WHY NOT FEED THE POOR BET YA CANT DO IT LOL
When you have 5 minutes left on lunch break
i wouldn't invite you to my party -.-
Are you even able to eat anything normally anymore lol
I still don't understand how your stomach is so flat after eating everything in the world whereas the Kardashian-Jenners are still restricting themselves from eating everything and maintaining their gym body lmao
He's the only YouTuber that nobody can tell him his old version was better
18 mins vs 5 mins Woooooow!!!!!! ☺
Pizza Party went out of business cuz of matt got free pizza for a year
Matts toilet: why do i hear boss music
Tommorow's headline: Many restaurants are getting bankrupt because of Matt Stonie

Matt : Unfortunately Pizza party is no longer in business. Me: I wonder why?
Therory 6 on where all the food goes: Mat stonie has a time machine portal in at the bottom of his throat that sends all the food he eats to the past so his younger self can eat it and his younger self sends it to his 67 year old self to eat
Imagine he failed 10 years on.
You should do another Dunkin’ Donuts
Video starts at 6:00
Damn he destroyed that record
How do they burp so much before starting to consume the food?
You know its impressive that Matt stonie can eat a 6 pound pizza in under 6 minutes but it's also impressive that he gets a million views in under a day
Can you eat in Pease for once for us?
When you become soo good at what you do that you become bored and start challanging yourself from the past... damn
i really hope you dont have a eating disorder you eat so much so fast a few times a week or so and yet so skinny.
Do the gunna snack challenge
Please Matt don't fast forward when you're eating we wanna see the entire thing
we need to remember not to invite him to any party

Matt Stonie: I'll kick anyone's ass. I'll kick your ass. I'll kick his ass. I'll kick my own ass.
Shouldve done all three pizzas under 17 minutes. XDD
I feel sad for his toilet 🚽
I think he literally destroyed his toilet after that!💩💩💩🤣🤣
When its quarantine and you have nobody to face off so you face off yourself
idol😘😘😘 i hope i can do that.🤔😁😁😁😁
Why not just add 1 slice from one of the other pizzas to the one closest, the 5.9 one. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Mother of God......

I used the stonie to destroy the stonie
How did that fit in him
Matt Stoner
6:47 for him actually eating
Older Matt firing off dissapointment shots to young matt is honestly a mood
Ive seen so many honey ads that I'm now starting to think whether I should actually start using it...
I dont know why but the sound of Matt dragging the pizza on the box sounded so... rough
raid shadow legends, sponsored by honey.
The only person one should compete with is oneself
No one can beat this
literally the worst toppings for a pizza in my opinion. I'd even take pineapple over either of those.
6:56 -me when I realise that my friends are coming to eat my food
Wtf that's three times faster
Image if young Matt Stoney watched this video in his time
anyone else watching in 2010?
Video lasts 10:29, starts at 6:53
I want him to eat 24k gold steak!   “Like so he can see pls”
Italiani? Forza Italia 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
"...they're out of business..." You really took advantage of that 1 year free pizza
6:47 thank me now
I watch this kind of videos just to remember how food looks
When Matt burp before eating the pizza    That's his belly machine starting.
Fun fact: he didnt use honey to buy the pizza
He reminds me of the hungry Caterpillar
Baby Stonie got his ass kicked brother. Kick ass vid. Wow. #MileStone
I thought it’s Michael Phelps challenge!!

Ok. So next challenge should be another leap back in time. Matt Stonie versus Kobayashi versus the Bear, side by side video. Lets go!
DESTROYED
There are 2 situations: Nr.1 is, that while I watch his video I get hungry and look for food in my kitchen. Nr.2 is, that I made myself some food and then watch Matt Stonie because watching someone eat while you eat is great.
Video starts at 6:26
Try to finish this pizza under 60 minutes.  Matt stonie: Am i a joke to you?  Pizza seller: Sorry sir?  Matt stonie: Let's say 6 minutes, i dont need the 0.

Thats cool and all but, did you know why Gru is the most powerful villain. First according to the height of a Minion (which is 3.5 feet on average) Gru is 4 minions tall, which means he is a godly size of 14 feet tall. Furthermore if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodges them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. After this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That’s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case.
All the olives and mushrooms made my stomach hurt 😂
Pizza's the best
This guy storage is unlimited 😂
FINALLY he found someone worth competing against!!

I kinda  feel  bad for his bathroom.
Old Man Stonie, pog
Oo nice
Matt finished his food quicker than it takes me to find a good tv show to start my meal😂
Do y’all ever think that the people that make his food knows that it’s going to be devoured/ used for a challenge? Or is it just me?
Holy hell. Freaking smashed it, man. You've come a long way. GG man.
Great job Matt!

Wait, so he's 28  I honestly thought he was younger like 23-24
somethings wrong,why isn’t matt driving?
He probably took a fat dump after this
Bestie
I have nothing against you personally, but all those food you’re eating, especially the red meats, are costing so much to the environment, and so unnecessary. I just don’t think binge eating should be turned into a contest or sport at all. Plus hunger is still an issue for lots of people.
Guys Matt stonie looking kinda sus
Dude how tf are you not gaining weight
Almost 6 minutes? Dude that’s weak I can do it in 5!     Hours..
He beats his own record in less than 1/3rd time. He is not human!!

You’re from SJ?
Matt should open his own restaurant called stonies pizza and have his own challenge
I was hoping he would do these kind of challenges. I hope he does challenges he failed in the past and attempt them now
This is just the wrong way to eat a pizza
Friend:I am  coming in five minutes WİLL EAT THE PİZZA TOGETHER MATT STONİE AFTER FİVE MİNUTES: İ AM SORRY

Sad thing abt the video is that its 10 mins long and the eating started 7 mins into it . A large part of it was covered by merchandise and sponsor ads .  Ads fucking up everything I like man
how do you not get fat 😶
One of the most perfect pizzas I've ever seen. Awesome toppings, right thickness of crust, and not over cooked/incinerated.
You should’ve eaten a slice of the thin pizza too...then ranked all three pizzas from best to worst...
Redoing the Michael Phelps’ challenge would be dope!

Matt stonie: damn im starving Every restaurant in a 5 mile radius: Oh neptune
Hallo Evanijo👋👋👋
Honey is probably one of the best Sponsors you could ask for. You don´t even know its there until you go to your checkout and realise it found you a promo code to save some money.   Using it since your first ad for them.
I can't understand why is Matt's talking so satysfyng🌚
Wait so you’re 28 years old ?
Stonie I went to buy some merch bro but you only go up to an XL on your clothes. That’s was a bad choice as you are missing out on allot of sales. Lots of people wear XXL
This is like when I’m end game gamora from the past fights the gamora from the future (or present in the movie)
How u not fat if I eat that I’ll gain 50 kg
I have noticed something, unless i am hearing you wrong, you dont know the difference between “fortunately” and “unfortunately.” Fortunately means you are fortunate or happy that something has happened. So to say “fortunately the old pizza place is gone,” is to say that you are fortunate or happy about it. Unfortunately is just the opposite. In your english breakfast video you also said “fortunately” you would not be headed to the UK any time soon, indicating you were happy about that. I think you meant “unfortunately.” Lol im not being a grammar nazi, i just picked up on you using the word “fortunately” in weird ways and wanted to point it out. Unless i am hearing you wrong! Love ur vids!
Baby stonie : I know my future will destroy my self
do more revisit challenges please.
Best eater ever
i really want matt to try the indian bahuballi thali challange
You know you are a buzzkill when the only person that can barely match you is yourself from the past...

If Pizza Party was still open they would point out at Matt's old picture, cry and sing a song about this legend while dancing around the bonfire.
Everything is so easy to him, that he started to battle against himself 😂
You should dedicate weight yourself before and after these challenges or just random things you do lol. Would be interesting to see how much of the food weight actually correlates to your real weight

How are you not fat
Ghichante🤣🤣🇳🇵

God of speed eating
Me: *orders two large pizza* Domino's employee: Wow, you must throwing a party. My fat lonely ass knows very well i am going to pizzas all myself:
You should start a series where you go back and redo challenges and try to beat them
Matt should do a month called redemption month where he eats once a week and the food challenge should be food challenges he's all ready done. He must beat his initial time or he fails redemption month.
Can't wait for you to crush this challenge again 10 years down the road!!
WHERE DID IT ALL GO THOUGH
Thought u were gonna eat there dang :/
I love his merch

Wish you could try my pizza stores pizza!! It's so damn good 🤤
Imagine Matt being hungry and saying:  Matt Stonie: "I can literally eat a whole box of pizza right now in under 10 mins"  Random stranger: *laughs in disbelief*  His fans and friends: " Oh that's not an exaggeration *he literally can* "

Please Matt, use KG. The world uses KG!
Idea for future video challenge: Dagwood sandwich Tower Make a giant dagwood sandwich filled with as many different meats, cheeses, vegetables and condiments you can fit really just put as much variety as you can think of (if needed put other slices of bread in between and long skewers to hold it in place). Top it all off with an olive on a toothpick. Bag of potato chips, french fries, or a dill pickle on the side optional.
My man literally cut his previous time in 2/3, why am I even surprised, it’s Matt Stone for crying out loud!
Sweet Jesus! Stonie went all comtest mode on that za
In 10 years time you will be embarrassed about this slow performance.
Damn bro you inhaled that pizza

Matt; "I'm actually starving rn" Everyone: I've seen this raw strength only once before.
The sad thing is that matt cant SLOWLY enjoy his food

I gave this video a 👎. Because a real Matt Stonie, doesn't waste time measuring, weighing pizzas, looking for quarter of an inch differences, a Real Matt Stonie just gets the job done.
i dad thought honey was a drug dealing extension
A lot can happen in ten years
God bless us all and protect us all stay safe  stay happy may your parents live 100 years love you all
Matt: eating a 6 pound pizza in 18 minutes is not impressive at all! Me: dies eating 2 slices
God bless us all and protect us all stay safe  stay happy may your parents live 100 years love you all
I guess Pizza party went out of business because Matt visited them for free for a YEAR😂
Stonie: No one can break my pizza record  Also Stonie: Hold my headtie
i was just here eating a dorito and hes already done
Me who can’t even eat a slice of Pizza properly: 👁👄👁
Did anyone else catch at 2:00 the two other big YouTuber names that popped up? If not press 0.25x speed.
Pizza Party would be proud
Are you ever worried about choking
What 18:05 minutes is not good enough for u most people can’t even finish
This just proves that your future self will always beat your past self if you just work on yourself each and everyday to become BETTER
Day! By day? His black hole is increasing

Question: before eating heavy, what preparations do you do before eating large amount of food the next following day coming up to eat that food?  And how do you rest after?  If you reply that would be great been wondering for a while now :)

2010 Matt stonie had to drive. 2020 Matt stonie has a driver. What 10 years and a few trophies will do.
So we can all agree: Matt stonie 2010 edition sucks
I like when he says eat it! Because you know... he eats things?

Damn. And shout out to Morgan for his killer comments.
Yuuck 🤢

Boss: You get a 30 minute lunch break Stonie: Eats Thanksgiving dinner and takes a 25 minute nap
You should link up with randy satel and do food challenges with him and see who is faster
Young Megatoad Stonie evolved into Old Man Stonie
Should call  it pasqually pizza. ?  Chuck n cheese 🧀?  Recycled pizza?
What would 2030 stonie do with this pizza? 😂. Awesome bro.
you're not invited to my birthday LOL
Matt could've finish in 3 or 4 minutes if he ate 2 slices at a time but don't rush, slow down a bit when eating
Does he have 2 different color eyes?
Surprised hes not fat
Employees of an unlimited pizza store : yo boss today's collection was great Le* matt stonie with band on his head : I'm sorry it's not your day dude...
There is always that one guy who eats alot but doesnt get fat

One of the best things about Matt Stone: He always knows how to hook us in from a good intro
Imagine if he couldn't finish that pizza at the first place
Baby Matt: Who are you? Old Matt: Literally you but stronger
This video is proof that Matt is the culinary Chuck Norris. He only has competition with himself.
“Ole man Stonie”  😂🤣😂🤣
How can someone improve at eating for crying out loud
"may the best matt stonie win" dang.
It's math with pizza!

10 years later:  Matt: guys there we go I ate the 6lbs 20 inches pizza in 20 seconds
That jawline only tells u the story...
2090 Matt Stonie: Hi guys today i'll be eating Jupiter in 10 mins
The reason why i don't watch Randy Santel.
Matt stonie: I’d rather be a 30year old me than a 20 year old you
So you’re telling me, it takes me 20 mins to finish a tiny slice of pizza. And it takes this man like 5 minutes to eat a giant 20 inch pizza
Just turns out to be Matt posts’ this same video in 2030 saying he can beat his 2020 Matt Stonie pizza eating time of 5:54! Like if u agree 👇🏾

I’m officially addicted to his videos now..... 🤷‍♂️😂
Bathroom left the chat
Omg this was awesome🤯
You should do your own show like man vs food and travel the us and do it
It is good to challenge yourself some I hope you make more videos of your new self challenging your younger self in food challenges like these
What if he recorded this and did worse than 10 years ago
How am I getting full watching this
7 minutes into the video and he hasn't taken a bite yet.
Do u eat this fast when you eat off camera
Who else thought he would be doing it in the shop
matt is one of my fav competitive eaters cuz he aint one of those nasty people that dip their food into water
Bruh... 2010 was a great year.
Why the fuck am I actually watching this though
That's the normal size I always get. Free pizza for 1 year for this mini pizza? Haha give me max 10 Minutes. 😂😂😂
Its year 2030. Matt was able to eat 10 pounds of pizza within 30 seconds.
Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooo

Bruh, you put them out of business! Not cool!
Thats my city!
a KING born this day
You're a sell out. Show some respect for your fans, you make enough money from youtube views, stop shoving merch and sponsorships down our throats for like 60% of the video
can u make a video on how are u "not fat" or how are u able to "digest so much of calories"???
U make me hungry. Thanks..
Petition for Matt to make a video where he eats his good slowly and enjoys it😁
Is it just me or is anyone else wondering how hr doesn’t way 700 pounds and how it takes him ten seconds to eat a slice of pizza
Literally just bad content , I don’t enjoy it anymore , this is what fame does. Not a fan anymore
Matt: eats a pizza that is 6 pounds but gains 0.00000001 gram Me:eats nothing gains 1 kg
I am having a bad night, and this made me smile and laugh. Thank you for this distraction. A lot of the time, these videos do just that, distract me and make me happy, even if it’s only for a moment. Thank you
i'm Indonesia
People are watching this must be hungry
Omg
In 10 more years, the his time for this challenge will be 1 minute.
Just Awesome ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Le pizza, get ready to die in fastest time on earth🎃🎃🎃

Love mushrooms on pizza but overall prob the least popular toppings on pizza.
Ngga ada obat nih orang 😑
Old stonie slap young stonie in the back of the head  Old stonie: that's how eat the pizza
Photographer 👁️👄👁️
"Matt stonie bought 3 boxes of pizza (20 inch each)"   Staff: But party is not allowed ???

Matt after the video Matt: Ok so that was light snack, now to snack number 37
all foodies like
The FaZe Clan know stonie!!!
WOW
ppl in the comments: "how is he so healthy or like not big?"  tiny answer from me:  he went to college and took a class in health he learned a lot about how to stay in shape and healthy there so he took that on with him as he started his career in food competitions, and it has to do with dieting and exercise but seriously tho, if you burn more calories than you eat you won't gain weight, that's just the fit part tho, being healthy has to do with what you eat. and that'll go into a whole bunch of details, lol. it's also called doing it for a long period of time, consistency is key
Man swallows while he is biting...
Always following the jaws. He can't beat him
Daaaaamn you smashed it 👀☄️
yo me comí una pizza de 18 pulgadas sin AGUA, nada de agua, ni un traguito de agua, hasta que la comí toda fue que ya pude tomar agua.

Wow well done but you’re mad so much food 🤢
it's only 20 inches? that is too small. there is a pizzarea near here and i ate a 22 inch bland unflavored pizza. at the end of the meal all i tasted was the flour xD i meant the prize for pizza for life to eat 20 inches in 1 hour is pretty awesome! i would have loved to have went to this place before it closed down.
OLD MAN STONIE

When he said he was hungry it was all over.
STONIE!!!!!

Did you not get meat on purpose?
20 inch pizza in my country is like 60$ XD
Now beat your hot dog championship numbers and time!
Matt when you do this do you enjoin your meal ? Prob not
*Next challenged that is sponsored by honey Matt should Eat a mass amount of honey and honey foods*
Legends are before 1 million views 😁😁😁😁
Me: I ain’t hungry for pizza Matt: Casually eats giant 20 inches pizza Me: I’m hungry
Matt 10 years later : 5:54 for a 20 inch pizza?! Pathetic.. . Lets do 20 inch in 20secs 🤓
When nobody eats the pizza in the party
The old stonie would have destroyed all three boxes....

Olives and mushrooms you sir are a champ
matt stonie when h e mass buys food cashier: who is all this food for matt:me cashier O-O
Me while trying to actually savour my food: pathetic
Driving 45% Opening the box 80% Eating 10%
Where's the Beef'
This man is his own competition.
Congrats beating yourself!!
Matt...I hate to be the kind of person to throw shade but... obviously food challenges aren't your passion anymore. I'm happy you're doing more with your life though!
How many stomach’s do you have matt?
that was epic!
2050: matt stonie eats half the earth's human population in 10mins
Now that you revisit these old chalanges you should revisit the 14lb bigmac burger chalange
YOU KNOW WHATS HAPPENED SINCE THEN THE CHILDREN BORN HAVE KNOWN NOTHING BUT CLEAR SKIES AND FULL BELLIES TO SLEEP    THIS GUY IS REAL LIFE THANOS
Bro I thought Stonie was at least 20-24 but he's really 28 years old 😂
He eats pizza like I eat        AIR. YOU WEIRDO !
ofc he is thin
actually Pizza Party closed Down because of very few employees & people stopped coming. Although the food wasn’t bad the place wasn’t lookin to well.
Imagine what starving African kids are thinking about while watching Matt`s videos...
Unfortunately you’ve only won the hotdog eating contest one time!  What’s up with that ?
😍🇮🇶
Matt Stonie Vs. Atlas
2010 = 18mns and 5s 2020=5mns and 54s 2030= 3mns lol
One slice of pizza makes me very full 😣
Hey Mat I've been watching your channel for a long time now and I love your content I also wanted to say zonners is the name of a pizza place that sells 24 inch pizzas I'm not sure if you have one near you but if you do maybe you could try it out
The local plumber in the area probably hates Mat
Today I had serious hunger pain and this man probably doesn’t even know what it means 😂
Damn that’s impressive
2010 was one of my fav years
Wow that’s a lot of food. So good luck 😉
Bruh I barely eat 3 pizzas imagine that😵😳
I wish he weighed the empty pizza box too during his outro. Still, good job Matt!
I would be full eating my first pizza like  that My man got talent
Bruh  Why you bully your old self
Yo but why does that Merch actually look dope😂😭👌 I like to have Stonies pizza 🍕🔥
He is just like beerus eat and then take a nap😂😂
Be safe out there Matt
I hope he does this challenge every ten years! Awesome job Matt!
@beardmeatsfood would have eaten all 3 .. just sayin
His toilet  evertime  he records a video  *Ah shit here we go again*
*When Matt literally defeats himself*
Bro do asmr plz
Imagine a 6lb dump 😆
And I thought my sister was fast at eating
Can you please do the eggscelent challenge from regular sgow
Buddy coulda just took the 5.9 jawn and grabbed a slice from another box tf
I cant eat that whole pizza bro. I could only eat one slice of that huge pizza.
I don’t know where that food go
Mushroom and olive are the worst toppings. You need some meat on their to make it juicier.
You are an animal
redo the phelps challenge
In the next 10 years he'll beat this challenge again. And I am telling you this, he will end it in 2 minutes.
I honestly thought that Matt was like 22
cant wait till 2030 when matt does it in 25 seconds
have you ever bit your finger by accident?
"Mushroom and olive"  Lil Bröther: "that one's got more meat on it"
You are god matt
ahhh olive attack. Popeye, is your wife on there?
PIZZA party when OUT OF BUSINESS because MATT STONIE RUINED them by DESTROYING their CHALLENGE !!
Your crazy dude 😲
Matt, why don’t you do a mukbang + Q&A video... this way your fans can get to know you better and everybody just wants to see you enjoy your food for once!
This video to all those who say Matt’s getting slower then his past self
At the end he's just like "My art is an Explosion!"
Keep killing it brother! Love to see you keep growing with your channel and success!
Matt: "The only one who can beat me is me"
I wish Matt would make a video of he eating foods just like a normal person should do 😂
Mushrooms and olives?? Those are the 2 worst ingredients for a pizza...
I’d prob finish that in 18 minutes too maybe idk I think   You a legend bro
Matt Stonie I live so close!
I use the Matt Stonie to destroy the  Matt Stonie
The OCD in me really wanted you to weigh the boxes at the end to see how much the pizza actually weighed... That box seemed like it was more than 10 ozs

How to summon food demon: 6:50:
So your crushing your own ego?      That’s tough
Try to enjoy your food , please :D
Does Matt stonie taste what he eats
I’m here thinking he breaks a new record every video shit 😂
It hurts
I wish Matt would just go back to his old days of doing the challenges and not bullshiting us with sponsors and merchandise. I'm 6 minutes into the video and he hasn't even started eating yet
MY GUY DISECTED A 6LB PIZZA
You're such an amazing athlete and I love that you don't ever leave any food behind.
What brand and model is that scale?
in 2030 hes gonna get 2 minutes
Did Matt stonie purposefully type the headline of the video “New record??”  I think he wrote it just for us to “Not”realize the ending and “NOT” spoil it for us.... Let me know ur suggestions, friends
I used my record to destroy my record
I wanted a slice
Thx for not click bating us
Mat stonie in 2030 eatting a 20 inch 6 pound pizza in 20 seconds

Is it bad that I just wanted you to enjoy that food it looked good
You are Amazing 😋
The fact that Matt stonie actually bodied this.. doesn't surprise me
How the hell is he skinny what is your secret?  I gained like 2 pounds from eating Big Mac once a week.
Matt Sonie you are one of my favorite pro eaters
Watching it during online class
monster 💪
Mountain mikes my childhood spot we used to frequent the Belmont location
It’s safe to assume that if we want Matt’s current records if we want to convert young Matt to black hole Matt then we have to at least decide each number by 3 🤣
nobody: chucky cheese: 5:05
I can’t imagine how many toilets he goes through every year 😂
Matt stonie vs grandma food
Wow I couldn’t imagine my self having that much pizza in front of me and not sitting back and enjoying it
Nice 👍🏼
Wow.. Matt has same age with me
I wonder what his shots look like every time he finishes a challenge like this
Just so happen to have a ad talking bout Colgate toothpaste that removes stains from 10 years 😂
How is this not on trending tho
Please collab with Tanboy kun🔥🇮🇩
the T shirt looks cool. i like the pizza on the back 🙌🏽
Pardon the language but HOLY SHIT
U eat alot but u r not that fat . How come???😆😆
When I was in San Jose, mountain mike's was God. The best supreme pizza and played double dragon all day. Berryessa ftw.
Why didn’t he just take off 7oz of toppings and add it to the middle pizza...
75 year old stonie sees this   75 yo stonie: im gonna end this man's whole career
If my calculations are correct Matt Stonie must be 28
Nice vdo
I've seen Matt put a lot of terrible things in his stomach over the years but mushroom and olives is by far the worst...
What is the old video called
I kinda wanna see him eat the 8 pound one...
When Matt stonie has to compete on his times
Should have did the 8IB pizza 🍕
When your so good that you compete with yourself
we are all gona die but this guy is gona die early
Who else is wondering  what happened  to the other 2 pizzas lol.
Maybe Matt was the reason the place went out of service
Absolutely amazing 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Video starts in 6:55
Hey Matt can you make one video.. Only ONE where you eat slow and savour it.. 😆
Most of the people only think about that pizza , but there is one more thing - (5 glasses of water aside) , so many doesn't identify it.
10 years later, Stonie will cut this time in half
Intro is all about roasting old matt lol
Wait did he just eat 3 slices of pizza in 23 seconds
Eat the Spicy chicken nuggets from McDonald’s with a Matt Stonie remix 😤
Pray for his toilet
Think my heart skipped a beat watching him down that food.
How many toilets have you broke?
What is your most viewed video saw one that was 78 million
Love from india♥️
Morgan with the big brain move
He must have hella jaw muscle to be chomping that bad boy in 5 minutes
Man VS Himself  That's pretty hype
😂 this is hilarious
Make a video where you are eating slowly and peacefully...
Inmage how many times he got his toilet fixed
Hmmm I can run a mile under that time. My fastest mile is 5:47 you were close to my mile time.😉 That was impressive eating congratulations.
It took ne 15 mintues to know your age- I Just realize since u were 18 ack in 2010, I just need o add 10 more years ._.
he destroyed , murdered and killed  the damn pizza and old matt stonie
I love pizza and you got black olives on them that's want I'm  talking about
Imagine he forgot to hit record...
Giving out free pizza for a year probably led to them closing down
I'm not so sure there's a challenge, but there's a place in San Antonio TX called Big Lou's pizza and the pizza sizes go up to about 40+ inches and probably weight around 10 pounds, not 100% on the weight but it's amazing pizza
That Matt Stonie kid has NOTHING on Matt Stonie
I still don’t understand how Matt Stonie isn’t fat.
6:55 save ur time:)
Taylor Swift:  Artist of the decade Matt Stonie:  Eater of the decade 😂👌
Holy shit bro
YOUR FINE ASS IF 28 YEARS OLD?????
I,d rather go through the pain because i’m young than sharing a gallon of milk with someone gay for 1,000,000,000,000,000$
Do more of this! There are so many early challenges of your career we would all like to see you beat again!
My tooth is screaming to never eat pizza that many
Matt : You Suck. You suck... Morgan : ...DEEZ NUTS. Matt :
10 years later..... Matt: Alright you guys thought that 5:54 sec is fast...? Well today we are gonna beat that record
You da man Stonie👍👍👍
When the intro is longer than the actual video, y'all know he smashed the challenge
Matt stonie : New amazing video! Me : did i ask?
disappointing i thought he was gonna eat all 3 boxes of pizza
There are 2 food challenges in my neck of the woods. I love your videos

Nostalgia

Matt 10 yrs ago : I finished this pizza in 18 min 5 sec. Matt today : I finished the same pizza in 5 min 51 sec. Matt 10 yrs later : you blink and it'll be gone 😂😂
For some reason I assumed he was gonna say nord vpn instead of honey

Bro I wanted a slice 😭
10:03 Deez nutz 🤣
What a beast!!
If you were 18 back in 2010 that means 28 now      See Mr.Peterson I can do math
Thats was impressive, even for Matt Stonie standards..
Never change your “MySpace style selfie” picture 😆💚👊
When you been doing challenges so long that the only person who can beat you is old you ... Young Buck Stonie vs Old Man Stonie lol 😂😂
Guess what he does right after the video.........  regurgitate everything. Lmao
When he has kids he's going to eat his kids
Ten years and that stomach wormhole is still healthy and holding tight. I'm glad for Matt. #drinkwater
Yeah Matt Stonie definitely won this
How he stays skinny is by eating it the. Barfing it all out

Matt totally rocked ..
Starts 6:50
He probably pukes the food out after the video
Bro do some india challenge
I bet you Matt Stony wins
So Matt finished the pizza 3 times lesser than when he did 10 years ago, so if my math is correct, Matt's stomach has grown 3x since 2010
2010 Matt Stonie is proud of 2020 Matt Stonie 😀
Matt Stonie in 2010 after seeing this: :O :O :O
This video is sponsored by                    HIGH CHOLESTEROL

Jesus loves you. He came and died for our sins so that we don’t have to die in them. He resurrected on the third day and he is coming soon. We need to repent from our sins and accept him as our Lord and Savior so we can be saved and go to heaven.
when you come back to your first ever boss battle in the game as a level 100
الله يرزقني كبدك ذي ماشاءالله
Omg
"The one who can defeat me, is me!"  *-Some anime character, weebs may knows who said it*
What is so noteworthy about a guy who kills his body by engulfing an insane amount of food and then barfing it all out so  that he can survive.  One day he's going to tear his esophagus in retching process and tear his esophagus and he'll die.  Actually, he should post video of him ripping the esophagus.
He went with chucky cheese logic
I remember ten years like last night food show 👍
Who wished he posted more ?
Mushrooms and olives😬
When you're level 100 and you come back to 1 hit the level 1 boss
5:07 Chuck E Cheese be like:
The sad thing is that the Bibo's looked like the best pizza of the three.
I want to see this guy actually sit and enjoy his meal for once instead of having to gobble it all down
When you defeat all your rivals and the only one left is you
Omg

At this point can he enjoy a normal meal and be satisfied
My man breaking his own records.
If a competitive eater smokes weed before a challenge, is it considered cheating?

Bro? How do you possibly do this?
Love u the master😍
I bet I could it          *If my mom told me to hurry up*
Matt Stonie should start weighing himself before and after a eating challenge
Stonie must have one STRONG toilet
Im so upset he didnt eat the bibos pizza. That place is amazing, im a local from were he went to get pizza and he really outed out bibos
Buen video Matt 👌
Damn, it takes me that long to eat two slices.

Matt: *Beating his own cuz no one can beat him...*  Davie: *W I S E  C H O I C E*
1 lbs a min  pretty much. Dwaaamn!
🔥
Legit question how do you not have high blood pressure or diabetes???
Matt Stonie is a beast 😁
Surprised Matt hasn’t made some food related merch. Like selling food not food on a t shirt
may the best matt stonie win and I was just like: RIPizza.
He weighed the box but didn’t eat the box
does matt stonie ever eat normally?

2050 Matt Stonie snaps his fingers and boom pizza gone in 2 seconds!

If u skip 10 seconds 2 slices will be gone
His stomach be like : hyy man, please stop, this is not a storage place🥺
Pls Wear a Facemask

Mountain mikes is heavy handed everywhere apparently

Honestly you should be the host of man vs food cause you take this shit seriously and you got an awesome personality! You kill it!
does anyone else feel like chewing for him lmao
It ain't a matt stonie food challenge if he doesn't accidentally gag on the food.
Mountain Mike's is the greatest
Me watching this being allergic to olives  👁👄👁
Matt Stonie: Enters random restaurant.    Restaurant employees: why do I hear boss music?
лайкните коммент чтобы американцы подумали что я написал что-то крутое

BRO HE SHOULD DO A FOOD CHALLENGE EATING 50 CROISSANTS.
Matt stoney the only dude i no that you can have a whole pizza and say matt im going to the bathroom come back 2 minutes later and the pizza is gone.
You're a bully to little you lmfao
I can only eat half😂😅
Imagine him eating yo a$$
That’s a big huge pizza, congrats 👏🏼
If my comment gets 1,000 likes Matt has to get a gastric bypass surgery
He should show what exercise he does because there's no way he doesn't get fat
This man can only use the phrase "The food disappeared" after you eat it. Like for real where the fuck did the 6 lb of pizza go in that 120lb body. From what I see his stomach didn't even move.
Coach Greg says you throw the food up... 😐😐🙃
Cracks back Old man Stoney
Wow👏👏
Pro-Eater never say die 👇👇

What the actual fuck...... 6 minutes less.....
BRO do you think you could do that in 5 minutes or less
How does he not puke after these challenged

Matt in 10 years: "so guys today I will be eating the pizza place"

Stomach:Ah sh*t,here we go again

Im willing to bet Matt put the original pizza place out of business. Shows up once a year to claim his free pizzas.  Matt pulls up*  Owner: please god no
This is my ultimate goal in life. To look back in life and say to myself that i can eat more now!😂😂
"Can I beat my old record of 18 minutes?"  Video is about 10 minutes long... guess he beat his record.
Amazing 😲😲
I'm all hyped up to eat........10 mins later I gotta hit the toilet smh...
I feel bad for that pizza but good job
Record completely obliterated
You gotta try Cicero’s pizza in Cupertino! Best pizza I’ve ever had!

Matt enters a restaurant for a challenge Owner = oh god it's him!
Wait, does Matt own a pizza store or did he just choose pizza for his mercy logo?

it will take 5 minutes and 54 seconds for me to eat a slice of pizza
Matt: I’m hungry All food within a 1 mile radius: ....
Your toilet must hear boss music whenever you enter the bathroom.
How about a rematch on the epic meal time kfc challenge??
Y’all think he took offense to the MrBeast video where they got Joe Chestnut instead of Matt to eat a pizza?
U know future Matt would of done 8
Plot twist: the only time he eats is when he's filming a video
Man I like Matt a lot but the cussing I know it does not bother most people but a lot of kids watch Matt
Im thirsty

Obligatory toilet-destruction comment

Chuckee cheese got real quiet when he put those pizzas together
He should do this challenge every 10 years of his life
Dude you look like little tay along time ago
What I if told u         U read the top line wrong💯😂🙅🧢
I would like to know what Matt’s food portions are like when he normally eats 😆 it would just be interesting to see how it compares
I can’t watch too many of these or else I compare my gut to Matt’s when I eat. Which we all know is like comparing ourselves to a God
10 years is a long time you’ve come a long way bro can’t wait for the next years to come 👍🏼❤️
Eating 🍕 😋
Ew mushrooms But very nice challenge and  a the music makds it better
I predicted 5min 30 something sec close
His toilet takes 24/7 therapy

honey is spreading faster than corona virus
I wanted to see the actual difference in the amount of food left in the old challenge.
Matt's neighbors: "You hear all that coughing going on in there?  No wonder they call him Stonie"  Matt in Reality: coughing over 6lb 20 inch Pizza
That was epic.
matt chickened out there. should've gone for the 8lbs.
This is just taking pizza from a baby
😳 DAMNNNNNNNNNN!!!!
Me: wakes morning to watch ufc My recommend: pizza challenge  My brain:
Who else starts eating when they see a Matt Stonie vid? I swear, I even try and head out to get stuff sometimes. A few years ago I watched a vid and came home with about $55 of BBQ. I'm not kidding. Even the people I know at the place were like "What the hell are you doing??"
Imagine eating a whole pizza in less than 5 minutes . U gotta be Matt stonie for that 😅        .
Beast!

Matt: this is the belly buster challenge   Me: yeah if ate that my belly would be unimaginably busted

This the dream job right here. 33K views at the time of me watching. Dude probably spent $45-50 on this pizza.
I belive i. You
me:how does matt gobble down food? my brain:his digestive system must be very fast
I love how much he’s hyping the belly buster challenge   And then the restaurant is closed
Matt you are like Asian Brad Pitt
Let’s take a moment to appreciate this man.
Those pizzas looked fuckin gross for me. I would've probably vomited from the smell 🤮
Bro! How havent I ran into you yet?! I live here in Santa Clara lmao I know exactly where that pizza party is. I used to go there when I was a kid lol
Youtube he's getting really comfortable with these double unskippable ads
Good challenge Matt
How is this man not in pain on the toilet
PIZZA!!!
Didn't count. He didn't eat the box.

Ngl, didn't see a difference  in the switch (slightly)
6 pounds of food in under 6 minutes, insane
Him eating: Ö Us: let us gst shusvdudgdgdudgdhdjsjsgddg
I will choke and die if I eat like that. Once I chocked on my food and it took me 6 months for my throat muscle spasm to go away.
Keep up your awesome work, Matt! Stay safe..

This is like beating the game and coming back to the tutorial

If kirby was a person ong
Matt Stonie eating food never gets old
Your eating so fast
You're my favorite eating challenger there is Matt!
Making World Records
Can't wait for the next part 10 years later
the mental process of realizing for the first time in 5 years that Matt lives almost less then 20-ish minutes from you..........
Matt: yes I finished my pizza for 5 minutes  Me: can you finish that for eating it normal?
Matt starts eating, my stomach starts aching 😂😂
I just realized he’s not in “the kitchen” anymore.
That pizza looked really good🤤
i knew i recognized that pizza box pizza !! best mom and pop pizza shop 👍👍👍
tbh i thot he was gonna eat three whole pizzas lmaooo
I feel like when Matt jumps up and shakes around while he eats, he switches stomachs to fill another one out of the 10 he has in there.
pizza poop
Theory: He doesn’t eat the day before he does a challenge🤔
Matt 3 hours later: DESTROYING my 1st Toilet
When u heard your siblings going down the stairs and u dont wanna share..
I have Crohns Disease
Mom: You better be doing your math! Me: Actually I’m watching a guy eat pizza.
damn this is crazy.
Brooooo he did it 3x better 🤯
black olive death.  YUK !
alright boy , will see you after 10 years to beat this record!
Hi
Sad I bet He wanted to enjoy that pizza but he had to eat it hella fast
I have never ate a pizza
That pizza looks good man!
We get Mountains Mike's pizza every other Tuesday 40 present off. And Brandon would have gotten all those olive out of the box
That Jaw Line
Theres an extra space between “YouTube” and “Food” in the title :)
Hey in case any of you may be wondering if honey is worth it... yes it is
How time flies by
Bro I could never
This is legendary..litterly in competition with him self from the past.Im only 1 min in the video.😳
I would like to know how do you feel after you ate all that pizza so fast?  That was so fast but pretty talented
YEYYY u beat it. In 2030 u can do it again !
Imagine being 1h early in a video thats gonna get 1m views
Love me a good pizza 🍕
I could eat that, it would just take me all day XD
Wow Mat is 28 years old        Old man
Real definition of only having competition with your self
in 5mins, I'm on the first piece lmao
I got a pizza from pizza box I had enough pizza for 4 days
Matt came back after 10 years Pizza's owner : ah sh*t here we go again.
YES
Las than 5 min
This is some of the most impressive stuff I’ve ever seen 🤯
Very impressive...      What? Did you expect a joke, nah, those are overrated
Matt Stonie: eats a 6 pound pizza in 5min Me: eats a plain cheese pizza slice in 5min
How did the pizza taste ??
this aren't healthy
Are you a little bit sick of pizza? 🍕😳
Im waiting for the day he bites his tongue in half from one of these. That would be horrible
new camera? neat
Lol
OMG
2030 Matt Stonie “Hey guys we’re gonna be revisiting the pizza for the third time” “Gets a time of 1:54” damn it cliffhanger
My stomach would be like: Man im jealous of his stomach
you were going off on your 18 year old self lol
imagine inviting him into a party
2010 matt stonie:wtf-
In 5 mins, I just finished my first slice of pizza- 😂
FINALLY! The idea of remaking old challenges always struck me as a no brainer. Some challenges just destroyed Matt back in the day, some taking more than an hour to complete. Now I see him complete same caliber challenges as back then and going under an hour so the idea of reclaiming those times he was defeated seems like a very interesting one
Start 6:50
How about the burger you couldn't finish in that challenge that one time with Morgan.
COSTCO PIZZA!!
Next video: I pooped up my house cause of that pizza
Try the King Kong pizzza from ny pizza in San José
Who want Matt to do Indian Biryani(chicken) challenge?   Like here 📍😍🥰
Why wouldnt you just take some of the meat off the other pizzas and put it on the one that was only 3 ounces off lol
😋😋😋
Iam poor , i even cant buy any pizza
10:03 DEEZ NUTS
Those toppings tho 😷
tell me how ur skinnier then me and i barely eat-
10:03 that was so unexpected I burst laughing I created a mucus bubble
Dunno how you eat all those mushrooms bro.
Matt Stonie for president!!
Love from London UK keep it up brother
Do you ever look at him after he finishes and wonder where that pizza went?
Hello matt im your big fan for eating😁😁
You should upload a second video of these challenges thats uncut
But when he eats his stomach is not fat ❓why
U r a supahuman bro
When Matt started to eat the pizza, i convinced myself that he could've finish it in under 5 minutes, but when i saw that he still had around 3 slices left, i realized he wasn't gonna make it. And yet, he beat the time he did 10 years ago.
Old Man Stonnie :D
Press Start!

I used to go to that Pizza place all the time as a kid.  I was there before it was Pizza Party--it was Pizza and Pipes.
yey! congrats idol
Matt Stonie's appetite is so large, it probably emits Hawking radiation
I don't think I could handle more than one slice of that thing.
To the person that’s reading this:  You’re very intelligent and adorable human! I hope you Stay healthy through these tough times,   My dream is to have 2k subscribers. I been struggling to get there!

Matt when he grows old  ''I'm tired of eating pizza, reminds me of when i did challenges back in the day, i hate pasta too, chicken too, Spaghetti too. Eh? what do i like? something tribal please, i haven't done a challenge of tribal food like ever''
So fun to see you eating from local SJ places. You make us San Joseans very proud.

Nice job on putting them out of business
The future Matt bullying the young Matt :(
Who else hates all the olives he put on there...

Matt: Which Matt Stonie is best?  Me (a YouTube intellectual): *THEY BOTH ARE!*
I ate 1 only pizza for 10 minutes  And stonie ates 6lb’s of pizza in 5 minutes......
Good grief that was impressive. Looked delicious too
The luck to have this happen  you is just unbelievable
Hor
Nice job man ... I am not a fan of Olives at least those kind and allergic to Mushrooms, but that was a great challenge man!
I would vomit all of that in less than 18 minutes

Matt Stonie: "I'm actually starving" Pizza: *please no*
That’s a long restroom break.

I just ordered pizza and now watching this coincidentally so hyped now 🍕
Now he should go back and do that 14lb burger challenge that he couldn’t do under an hour, it was like 7 years ago he would destroy it now
Imagine going back to 2010 and showing Matt stonie this video 🤣 How freaked out would he be
This dude deserves all my likes

Matt wearing only black t shirts did you see that 🤣
EARLY
I’ve never been this early ever
The fact that the belly buster shirt he got 10 years ago is big on him NOW- 😮
That shopping center is right across from my neighborhood! Pizza Party use to be called Pizza & Pipes and I’ll never forget that Belly Buster Challenge. So awesome to see you revisit the place Matt!
So why is the merch about pizza? Is it because that was his first challenge? I'm honestly curious. New fan here.
I bet he could eat those 3 pizzas in less than 18 mins.
I eat a cookie and I gain 15 pounds.Matt eats everything you can think of and he is still skinny
That time is actually insane if you think about what he just ate. Holy shit
Matt Stonie 2010 : 18minutes Matt Stonie 2020 : 5minutes Matt Stonie 2030 : 59seconds  Mat Stonie 2040 : AWWWW !  MY THOOTH

I just love the way his eyes pop out when hes filling his mouth with pizza 😂

Idk why but stonie’s pizza actually sounds like a real pizza place🤔
Who else thought that Matt was just some random joe until they clicked on his channel then he became ur favorite YouTuber
I honestly believe you could’ve killed all 3 in less then 20min.. I believe you’ll kill baby stonies time.. challenge accepted??
I live 10 minutes from there, maybe one day after this pandemic i will see you in a restaurant making a video.
WOW
it only takes you six minutes to eat the pizza and its annoying when the entire time youre fast forwarding. dont even get to see you eat it
The older pizza looked thicker. But bro, you killed it. I loved the vid. You always kick ass. Keep it up Boss..
You should do 100 Cake pop Challenge
I can't wait to see the time that 2030 Stonie gonna post, lol!
His brother always sounds like he just took a nap, is still sleeping and is about to fall asleep - at the same time.

Why does he look like he is going yo give a inspirational message in the beginning of the Video. The tone, emotion and passion to a Pizza. Damn he is more energetic than he ever was. Mega Toad 💪
The challenge: nobody can eat me!!!..   Here it comes Matt Stonie   CRAP!!!
Am I stupid but what does the little table in the pizzzzza mean???🍕🍕🍕🍕
5 minutes is how much it takes me to eat two small slices
Goat of eating food
After all these years I still think Matt has a black hole in his stomach.
That's crazy
Past Matt Stonie: No one eats faster than me. Current Matt Stonie: Are you sure about that?
If I see one more toilet joke

Matt Stonie's countdown before he eats brings me as much eagerness as BadlandsChugs' "enough talk"
People said that Matt Stonie only have American fans   Like if you're not American

hes prolly the only youtuber that didnt switch up his content after his channel got bigger
I just want to see you sit down and enjoy your meal LOL
Sweet mercy. That pizza got obliterated. I couldn't eat 3 slices of a regular pizza in under 6 minutes, must less that beastly thing.
You should do a spicy  pizza challenge

This is probably the most we've heard Matt curse in a single video
World Record!!!
Morgan really said "You're neck and neck with your old time" LOL

Congrats on beating your time of eating this large 6lb Pizza! I know you can do it because of how much you’ve improved since you did that challenge 10 years ago! Oh, and speaking of pizza, I’m eating a pepperoni Little Caesar’s pizza right now. I’d love to try a mushroom and olive pizza one day in the future! 😃👍
Legend.

*skips 10 seconds* *Matt half way done with the pizza* 💀
Can you eat with @joel Hansen and @Ryani
When Matt says he’s starving, you already know the challenge ain’t a challenge no more 😂

When Matt is starving, you know he's beating that challenge.
Another ten years and he will finish it in seconds

Basically a minute a pound
My birthdays June 20th!
Joey Chestnut I think held the pizza record but now you broke it
He starts eating the pizza at 6:53 for anyone who was wondering
Do you remember gumball's pizza pizza pizza episode! That's awesome
Dad
POV: you go to the oldest video  of Matt stonie
When Matt says he's starving, you know it's armageddon for the food.
That’s literally more than a pound of pizza per minute
Wow he is just swallowing most of those bites without chewing
2010 stonie watching this like 👁💧👄💧👁
1:34 "The spons-"  Me: *Presses right arrow key eight times*
Is he enjoying the food cause he's eating it *fast!*
I wonder what time the 2030 Matt Stonie will have compared to this one.
Yummy 😋 My favorite pizza is sausage mushroom and black olive
Wow!! This is the earliest I have ever been on a Matt Stonie video..
I remember his hair 10 years ago. #Memories.
I thought Matt uploads once a month, is he doing each week now?
He’s his own competition
Stonie doing a chucky cheese
Everyone food item's dream is to not get chosen to be eaten by MATT STONIE.
Join Honey...now I oddly want to see Matt Stonie eat a lot of honey...
Hi
matt that's my favorite pizza topping!!
Legend says that Matt made them go out of service
https://youtu.be/7DMSgwlG_MY
Free pizza, sounds like a big price margin
It takes me 5 minutes just to eat one pizza and Matt ate one in 10 seconds 😂
Can i have a Pizza ? 🍕and a sprite 🥤? Thx  👇
I skipped for 1 minute and the pizza was gone
Can you pls make vid that you just enjoy the food in
how many times have you accidentally bitten your finger?
Damn Time Fly big fan stonie
2030 matt: look at this Amature
Interesting.....

matt: im starving pizza: heck u!!!
Mountain mikes makes up for the other pizzas      Mountain mikes is that one mega clutcher
Pizza is my number one comfort food. This video was perfect. Thank you 😎😎😎😎😎
The box itself has weight, so it's not technically 6 lbs he ate. Should've had the 3rd pie bc it was 8lbs, so it was more of an accurate weight.
It's funny how he has accomplished more then me by just eating
I never get hungry watching his videos lol
Let’s just pray that Matt stonie never becomes a zombie 🧟‍♂️
You know Matt’s trying when he ain’t talkin
Matt stonie starts dancing and says: IM IN LOVE WITH PIZZA IM IN LOVE WITH THE PIZZA
Thats a 69% difference of the times Nice
Earlybird!!
Chuck e cheese be like: 5:03
Just imagine eating all these calories a day
Baby Stonie was so cute♡
This is like that opening scene from the speed racer movie where speed is chasing his brother's shadow, lol.
C'MOWN, C'MOOWWN
When mat stonie says he’s hungry he’s about to set a record
he should re-do all the ones he had failed in the past
What, no pineapple!?  Throw it away.
Look at him now.. wow
Good job not my type of pizzas not a fan of oliiivss and mushrooms
Wow
That dude is probably a monster in bed
Can I get the other slices of pizza
Can you do a collaboration with the BBQ Pit Boys?  They cook it and you eat it, way faster than they imagined possible? :)  Or maybe you'll just make one of the recipes from their channel yourself and eat it.
Morgan so smart hehe
Stick debes hacer eso
2000th yaay
He didn’t eat the Little Tables.....0/10
Three things humans will never understand:  - Time travel  - Politics  - Matt's diet

You make me hungry hungry hippo
Yea
Oh gosh lol I didnt realise this was made 20 mins ago 😂

Matt: has 12.5 millions subs.. Also Matt:" I'm finally going to be putting out some merch!"  Edit: omg... 6 minutes!!!!  😅  Love the videos man. Long time fan,

Ok brad.
The thing I like Matt is he sets the challenges that everyone copies and he only competes with himself
정말 잘먹는네
Do you throw the food up?? Or are you forced to let it digest? 😢 and are you constipated?
Yessir
Matt stonie doesnt realize it but his younger self is the one who really won. He got free pizza, a shirt, and more free pizza FOR A WHOLE YEAR. You got beat old man stonie.

Let’s just appreciate that this guy has never clickbated us (beside the YouTube play button)
Matt Stonie never disappoint us.
should've weighed that half of pizza box to get the full weight xD
Imagine this guy, eat in your birthday party.
I like how he doesn't like the ppl that sponsors  things and don't use it but Matt stone he actually uses honey a lot.

No one  Absolutely no one:  That one person: *FIRST*
I guess this video is proof of Pizza Party going bankrupt

Too bad it wasn't 4 20-inch pizzas 😉🥴
OMG dude I've been there many times! We live so close to each other. Evergreen area I'm assuming :P
Obesity: just tell me doc Doc: It is a case of the stonies  Obesity: (shaking tremendously) which type?  Doc: unfortunately the Matt  Obesity became thin the next day....
How come he gets skinnier and skinnier the more he eats?!
I forgot Matt stonie is a flipping BEAST at fast food eating!? 💯✨
First time seeing his video so early because I live on the opposite side of the world aka India
The other day my 4-year-old layed into her cereal chomping hard. She saw my bewildered look and happily chirped: "I'm Matt Stonie!". Woops....  P. S. We want to see you smash a pop corn challenge.

Swallowing food without chewing it is very dangerous kids. Do not try this at home.

After all these years eating so much food, how are you not fat

It’s always a good day when Matt stonie upload
https://youtu.be/6dQ55c-U-MQ
Matt’s facial muscles are stronger than my will to live
Did you use Honey to save on your failed trip to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contents?
https://youtu.be/6dQ55c-U-MQ
Adam Richman: "What are you?" Matt Stonie: "Death."

Hey Matt can you do the halal guys spicy challenge next?
Damn he's stoned
"Youtube is really getting comfortable with these double unskipable Ads.
His next video should be called Haulin' in Holland, eating food, from Holland, haulin'.
All that commercial , editing , and time just to watch someone freaking choke a ton of food in their face..... 7:48 ..... ima just unsub and move on with my life.
That was pizza perfection 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
When the pizza is all to you
Make this a series matt vs matt no one is your biggest challenge other than yourself
This can be interpreted in so many wrong ways. “It’s gotta be like 20 inches” “ah shit, it’s crusty and shit”
wOw
Im glad to see that you put you heart and soul and tumtum into making these vids keep up the good work
Finally the new video comes 😂

I've never seen someone eat like this kid
7:35 is the exact moment he switches to his second stomach.
Me:clicks on the vid Me again:This gonna be satsifying Matt:enhales th pizza Me:Oh that wasnt satisfying
Definitely recommend NewYork Pizza. They have locations in Palo Alto and Mountain View. They have a King Kong pizza, it's 24 inches and relatively cheap as well. Good value and super good taste.
10:03 "deez nuts"
Does he go off cam to throw all the food up when videos done? Like where does it all go
Collabs with tanboykun matt
There is a recall of mushrooms, they're reporting salmonella outbreak.
Grats baby.. randy san would be mad lol

Nice video.
Hold up wait a minute u forgot Guys subscribe!!!!!
Could've just asked one place to add six pounds worth of toppings.
18 minutes
noice       :)
Does anyone imagine Matt actually eat like this normally. Just imagine him going to McDonalds, asking for a Big Mac and chows it down under 1 minute. Surely he doesn’t always do it, right?
the first bite I would've barfed there are so many god dang olives
I think matt's metabolism is like Goku's and the other Saiyan's
Watched it twice
WTF!!! 5 min and 54 sec 2010 defeat
So what you are saying is Matt bankrupted the pizza place.  Did he eat there regularly or something?  JAJAJA
You should go to San Jose and do a challenge
Susahnya nak jadi org petama

I wish you could taste the real pizza! I know you could and would have like 4 or 5 pizzas EEEAAASY
stop it get some help
Matt literally drove to three different pizza shops, bought three different pizzas, amalgamated two of them, just to be faithful to the challenge, THEN beat his time by way more than 10 minutes...       Respect.
Can't wait for 2030 Matt Stonie to beat this time.
You're actually nuts dude.  Mad respect brother🖒🐐👑
Master stonie Smoke his old minutes Congratulations on the new time

If Matt had videotaped her daily life, it probably wouldn't be much different, I even think he's recording her daily life sometimes.
Do you not eat for days when you eat all that food also would you ever get sick of eating that food
to my mountain mikes lovers whats your favorite pizza?  mine: jalapeño pepperoni and diamond head (pineapple and ham)

The bad thing is I just bought something and I could have use honey
Based on mathematics, in 2030 Matt Stonie should be able to eat it in 2 minutes
matt can finish all of that and..   i can only be full after eating a cup of noodles
2010 Matt Stonie Pizza Time: 18:05 2020 Matt Stonie Pizza Time: 5:54 2030 Matt Stonie Pizza Time:
Do 10,000 calories of French toast from Greg Doucette’s Cookbook 😎
18 minutes nothing to be proud of? I would be proud if I finished a quarter of that pizza!

Heyyy!!😍😍😍😍😍😍
Looking at that time you must've actually been starving when you said that.

7 minutes 32k views wow bro this is fantastic
Free pizza for a year, but only one per month 🥲, so is 12 pizzas , not 365 pizzas.  Edit: Out of business!, guess everybody won the challenge and only went for the free pizzas once a month.
3:14  those who have siblings will understand: v
Damn, destroyed that old record, that's nuts! Crazy how much you've improved and refined your craft over the years!
I see matt upload, I click
Matt should’ve hosted Man Versus Food series on tv.
The saying: Going down memory lane Matt Stonie: *Eating through memory lane*
Matt try and redo the Epic meal time KFC challenge..(Like you promised).
:)
This dude has 12.5M subs from eating. What a life...
Look at dem jaw gains bruh. 10 years ago Matt had chubby cheeks!
It wouldnt be a Matt stonie video without a gag
You've cheated death way to many times
Did Matt just pull a Chuck-E-Cheese?
Man got stomach foe days 🤷🏿‍♂️
Comparing both times I can say that escalated quickly
What i say is just "Impressive "😎😥😱
That was at least a 2lb box 🤔
My question is how does he stay in shape
He would make any italian grandma happy.
Thats amazing that one pizza is 3lb and one is 8lb... Same size. Probably similar costs... If you know your pizza shops you can really get your moneys worth.... Or get screwed lmao.
Wow Matt Stonie how big is your stomach storage gosh dang man😂
Matt Stonie in 2030: Alright guys today I’m going to be beating my puny record from 2020. Having your time in minutes is nothing to be proud of.
Today's menu selection is very good! I'm still wondering what to eat today! I want to eat your food as it is!!!
2010 Matt: woo! I got 18:05!  Present day Matt: Hold my beer
SUSHI
When he ate the first slice in 10 secs I new this was going to be good
I swear Matt will accept any challenge

Pizza
The problem here is that he is not even a big person and it is unbelievable that something like that would fit in his stomach
Matt: finished the whole pizza in 6 min   Me: finished 1 slice of pizza in 10min
When Matt Stonie's only competitor is Matt Stonie lol
Matt: "I can't wait to try this."  Also Matt: *Eats it in 6 minutes*
