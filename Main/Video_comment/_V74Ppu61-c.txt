How about we stop locking up the good guys
My favourite song of your guys, you and LW 🔥😍😍😍😍
Men realize this is just a song.  DON'T put yourself in that situation. Stay out of people personal relationships you will loose in the end whether that's getting hurt, jail, murder or life in prison while they move on with their life who is going to take care your children your family because she's not NO he should've waited his ass in the truck and called the police if he truly wanted to help
That's how u write a song
powerful message 😢
Hey Matt National Guard from Portland...Rae Ritthaulers buddy! Remember when you propositioned me and when I politely turned you down, you said you could bury me and no one would ever know? They see you too..
Just wanna appreciate they didnt post-produce this live recording with pitch correction etc
As a survivor of the trailer park, never been beat by my wife but I like this song 😂
Lainey is doing something generational right now. She will define country music the way Reba did. This is her Fancy
Angels or Christ don’t fight for us… but Ian kicked his ass!!!!  Fought for my honor… I wished he begged for forgiveness ✌🏾 love you E, best relationship I ever had 🌹
Sounds like me because I would do what he did in his song
Has bluegrass it's not what it is has the Steiner family pops in they say that's that Foster Newman boy call sometimes children if you face the devil Halloween every night and don't forget who I am did you take those things and you do what you do remember School waits on you is your friends who will go higher than you get mad when they look at you know you're wasting your life and being something that you could never be do they know the worst in you if you will come to that live tree
Take me to you something at times are coming and he couldn't have come better than when the little boy couldn't talk it was a hot Summer's Eve as I sat there and Mama gave me some cars to read father index way BBC I don't get mad at the father as you see the father stepside inside of me God's going to tell you how Hardy with all this for it's a boy that's never lived alive like me you take that 44 from you and turn you like a tree make you run up that tree like a coon you are can you take a little more on boy that puts Jefferson City Tennessee that will be your twin get up there while I'm walland en stories come in the middle of the night iz Rex take a life I carried my Tammy Sue it's another Tammy before this Tammy but that Tammy was before her I carried her on my back down fieldon store Rhode cuz I tell you what on field and Stuart road I'll wake Rick Fielding in the west who still live here I'm the bluegrass before the bluegrass boys
this hits home, story of my life.. 🥹🤍🙋🏼‍♀️
Absolutely love this song one of my favorite
I am thoroughly libertarian, but I am uncertain whether I can appreciate this song. I believe in the rule of law because it guarantees us all a degree of justice. Justice cannot simply be achieved through violence. That goes against everything that civilization and Christian education teach us!
Scott wil johnson said would beat me up if he ever saw me again sais that during the pandemic on thr old school group reunion group cheat during the pandemic sent it to my former school teacher
This is the best collab ever!!! Lainey gets Hardy fired up😂 luv it❣️
David, I love you and your amazing voice beyond words!  You are among my favorites of Garth Brooks and Jon Bon Jovi!!  Please continue  to share your amazing talent with us!!
This is what a REAL MAN does to trash!!! Kill em let God sort em out!!
❤ aWesOMENess 💜💫 🇺🇸
❤❤❤❤❤the song Lainey!
I love Hardy! Lainey tries to steal the show, but instead ruins it!
This Sing Reminds me of my Dad, I'll never forget shaking Summer 2024 and writing out a text to him and told My Pop's"I Need You"⚓✨🦅✨I wasn't kidding#Survivor.✨🩵✨🦅
Love this guy, kind of reminds me of Steve Earle.
Thank You.. ❤
Did you know that I was abused by ex boyfriend three times ? Do not tell anyone about that I was burn by fire in van by ex boyfriend he went to Nashville people who got him caught persun hit him before that happened he died
Best song I've heard,only country boys really get it, world needs more country justice.
❤❤😊Diane
Sadly statistically. She would have gone back
a year later im back brother your work on your vocal between this and a year later are fucking amazing good shit man
She Rivals REBA AND THAT SAYS SOMETHING
The sexiest blonde I have ever seen and amazing singer to boot, what a combination
Beautiful  vocals!! I love both of them!!
Lainey.  More like Lordy!  Best hips in the biz...
R.I.P. Toby Keep riding off into the sunset you gave all you had!!!!
For sure! Great one and so glad it’s all over for me 🎶💪🏻🥲
This is what I would have grown up around. This is what we have done and would still do. We are real mean. We are from the 70s and early 80s
That Lainey Wilson Side View. 😮
Call 911
These two are awesome in this song❤❤❤
She's the best thing to happen to country music in a long time.
Luke and the kids to be able to come back to work and I can get
And to think Lainey Wilson was rejected by American idol and the voice seven times each. She's the absolute best
Lainey Wilson will be a supper star
Bello 😢 !!!!🎼🎼🎼gracias   🇲🇽 👏🏻🫶🏻💔❤️
I love this ❤❤❤❤❤
This and Tornado are two of my top 25 go to love lost songs! Sing ‘em almost everyday!!
I'd have absolutely no mercy on yo ass Laney!❤
Nice box,and dragging a Wagon!!!😊 Nice Lainey!
So pulling it's out ok,but asking if you like a taste is outside a modicum of decorum! Nice Puss Laney!😂
I want a man like Hardy to protect me.
My goodness I love this song..
Luke said he would like to go back and get some rest and I can come back and I can get you some time for me and I will get it to the kids are in my office now so I will Luke said he will be in the boys are we still going with the boys have a lot of people in the hospital since we are not home until tomorrow morning and the boys have a good time I get it to
LOVE, LOVE this!!!!❤
I love you Luke said he would be able to get my life and the kids to the last time I have a lot of work and the boys have to be able and the boys are you going with the boys
I love you Dad I love you too my precious baby girl see you Monday
I love this song I can relate to it so much
🎵Lainey, you weigh as much as a truck🎶🤣
Ella Langley does a better job on this song than Lainey. Ella should have been the one to record it in the first place, not Lainey.🎶
❤❤❤❤❤
God bless country music!!!!🙏🎸🎹
I hope these 2 collab a lot more!!😎💪🎸🎹🙏
Meh.  Great tune  great lyrics but awful stage presence.  Awful appearance.  Acting like a rapper while singing country.  Hypocrisy on full view.
Best damn song I've heard in a long time  !!
Songs like this are what real country music is all about......
Most good
I don't want you mad at me cuz I come see you today or yesterday I'm not mad at you I want you I come see you tomorrow. I love you
AWESOME!!!! Love this colab!
Nope a song is in the heart just  it goes with u its  just ur
Wrote as silent partner
There's no way he didn't open that truck door for her... Especially Live!!! SMDH
Goose bumps ❤❤
First time hearing this and wow this hits hard. Havent been listening to much radio in several years just because i enjoy my peace and quiet while driving (my get away from life) real country is finally back.
Such a heartfelt song with passion by two artists who could not have done any better  Perfect
This song sends shivers down my spine,so relatable ! ❤
Every woman that's been abused by an ABUSER AND GETS NO HELP FROM THE OFFICALS...!!!!! GREAT JOB KARMA IS A BITCH...!!!
Such a stupid concept for a song you kill the guy and just sit there. Get the hell out of there you’re going to go jail for the rest of your life when you could of left what an idiotic song
I need to leave my husband because of the abuse
The setup is to much lol
Cakerrrssss
He should do the Super Bowl halftime show. Bring back some good country music. I agree with y'all.
Man this brought back memories of my X husband but it was my parents that were the Angels I’ll never forget that day on my 20th birthday just so glad my daughter didn’t know she was 1/ 1/2 years old she was upstairs
That song reminds me of me
Hey Beyonce... This is how its done 👍. Real country!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wish I had someone save me like that 😢
This HARDY killing Bro Country and saving Real Country like Lainey, in front of a bro country audience. Pure Poetry.
Hardy is awesome son!!! Lainey is great also!!
Being beaten by men myself this song I relate to it’s bittersweet for me I’ve forgiven them but I’m just happy I got out alive my dad would drive by sometimes he would see me standing on the side of the road. My 2 year old daughter would be in here crib i”m blessed
That's ass isn't the same.
''I knew right then id never get hit on again when said to me, you weigh  as much as a truck...''
Strong!
This song is 🔥🔥
This is by far the most powerful country music song I have heard in years, and the production values are outstanding, and the vocal power of the performances unparalleled. Simply stunning on every level!!
She is absolutely one of the few people who can actually get away with doing this song after Dolly and Whitney
As a survivor of DV, Hardy will never have any idea how important this song is. Bless Hardy for writing it and bless Lainey Wilson for taking it on. They are both so pure, raw, passionate and genuine. Bless you all for putting this out there. I love this particular performance, i literally watch it daily, it helps give me the power to keep moving on. 💜
Watch this daily! Love it!
You are the best singer ever me and my mom love your songs we are a big fan of your songs and you
I am a DV survivor, this song breaks it all down for abusers it there....eat a bullet !!! Lainey and Hardy have put it right out there,  no one deserves to be abused but we can and do survive and thrive!!!!!  Lainey's eyes, all teary, I just cant😢😢😢😢
I'm going on your concert September 13th
AMEN
Killing a man for revenge is murder you fucks
Unfortunately there are many stories like this throughout America...!!!! I was 1 of those women...!!!!! Stay strong women and fight back ...I promise that's the best way to stop the man who's hurting you...!!!!! I did and no more terrorists men in my life...!!!! STAND UP AND FIGHT BACK...!!!!!! YOU HAVE MORE STRENGH THAN YOU THINK...!!!!!
Just goes to say bad mf drive Chevy
Love this song and they are both 2 amazing singers ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dudes, I've gotta be happy for my man behind the kit.
She ain't country.  Give it 1 more year.
Awesome Hardy. From Michigan
I'm just mad he went to prison. I kept waiting for "then i got pardoned" part of the song 😂😢
❤❤❤
There’s a saying your a demon you must do one bad thing a day but your a good demon well that also means angels you have to do one bad thing
This is ass kicking country right here! So awesome
Wow have mercy on me🥹🙏🧡
Luke said he's going to be at work and I have a lot to do with the boys have a good day at work at the same place as I was on
3:36 this one of the best songs ever it tells me girls are always to be protected at a NY cost
This song sends dangerous undertones to the public.. and most of you are not smart enough to see it...taking the law into ones hands is very dangerous....in a age where manipulation is so common that even grade school kids are seen using manipulation tactics every single day. why would you push a song with a lets break laws because someone else did out on to the public encouraging those who listen to break laws... So many can take this and say they was justified which is a form of manipulation...or those who have been manipulated can then justify breaking a law and potentially taking a life over a small white lie told by another...this song should not of be awarded anything... simply because it is encouraging folks to bypass the laws set forth for our safety regardless of whether you think your local law is honest or not... the law in general is meant to do what we should not be doing which is dispensing justice on a whim.
He's no angel honey Angels don't don't do that honey and love it all honey and love you so much honey ❤❤❤
I listen to this song everyday and I love it it's my favorite song Honey and I love you honey thank you for sharing your songs and videos love them all very much your the gueen honey 👑 and I'm your king 👑 honey thank you so much God bless you honey love it all ❤❤🎉🎉🤠💎👑👑🙏😇🌎✨✌️🥰💕🤩💞☀️❤️‍🩹🥊💨🥊💨🎶
Loved this song
Love this song!!!!!    I thank God everyday for my Angel that said wait in the truck.    I hope the Monster rots that put me through hell!
I’ll take the truck ! ……
Wait in the Farmtruck!
I like this song.
Was easily the best version over ever heard
That be what I call slow  dancing hugs and whisper
Peayerhello
Wow this has 70s vibe all over it. Amazing
I saw this last night for the first time, obviously blown away as I posted last night. Well just watched it 3 times in a  row tonight. I'm 65 and have seen a couple Grand Ole Opry performances. This could possibly be the best one ever. Go Jesus!!!
This might be wrong. But wasnt hardy a country singers producer? And now someone who has an ear for this type of music. Is strictly making this music. Give heaven some hell. Great example of how hardy is meant for more than producing country music
pandering. shes in spanks and ringsssss
I love this song.. so touching
❤hardy
Still great! Thank you❤🎶
❤love&lite ❤God bless ❤
Can't believe this song didn't win. Just saying

AWSOME  MUSIC🎧🎤🎸🥁🎼🎼
Utterly fabulous.
WHEN U LEADT EXPECT IT SHORTY
My x wife did parental kidnapping 2 years 2 months ago in a rv with no clue where my kids are or if they are ok. Since then I’ve developed a 15 beer a night habit. I know it’ll kill me eventually. If I didn’t though I’d check my s&w oil needs by taste. Almost gave a few times. Only thing that  stops me is the thought of how it would affect my awesome kids. Thank you Jelly Roll for your music.
U STILL NOT UNDERSTANDING,GET RIGHT OR GET GONE. ITS NOT UP TO ME. I FORGAVE MY ENEMIES,I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP FORGIVING,I REPENT OF MY SINS TODAY,I BLESS THOSE WHO HATE ME AND BLESS THEM THIS MORNING,,NO MATTER THE TRIALS JESUS,I GIVE U MY BATTLES,I PRAISE U THROUGH THE FIRE,I HONOR U LORD,I BLESS U JESUS,AND I LOVE U WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL
IM GOING TO MAKE THIS CLEAR AND TRUTHFUL. I DIDN'T ASK FOR MY LIFE,OR ESPECIALLY TO BE HATED BECAUSE OF MY LOVE FOR CHRIST WHO DIED FOR ALL, WHEN I FINALLY FIGURED OUT I WAS CHOSEN TO GO THRU HELL NOT FOR U ONLY TO SHOW HIM THRU MY EYES,ITS NOT A JOB IM WILLING TO GIVE UP AT NO PRICE WILL I STOP DOING AND SERVING HIM. IM SORRY FOR THE LOSS OF THIS PERSON,ALL I CAN SAY IS BE CAREFUL I SPEAK FOR MYSELF AS WELL ,U NEVER KNOW AN ANGEL SERVING AND GIVING MESS
Dddddssdf
Ive been abused as well..... I always hit first so i believed i deserved it..... I also suffer from a head injury..... Today i know i dont deserve to be beat on!!! I have learned my lesson. God bless the writers and singers of this song!
❤❤❤❤

On REPEAT
Sounds more like Metallica than Metallica 😂
❤❤❤
I remember hearing my dad and other soldiers who found our shop, he was a diesel mechanic and operator. They would talk about this and other battles  Boy could he rebuild a muscle car and make it sing all the way down the drag  strip. He didn't have to touch the clutch just power shift all the way
Shout out to the set designers
Something tells me Luke was pulled on the stage by blake on the fly.  Man, what a performance!
HARDYS raspy "lord" at 3:54 dude.. damn it sounds so genuine and just fucking powerful
Would’ve been better with a Ford truck!
Good Job Jason ❤
2:34 juhhh
Still my favorite song ever
Great song! Thanks for the  music that makes others aware! Great artists❤
I absolutely love this song ❤
im giving that chevy truck in the wait in the truck video to britt for her b day.
if yall wanna go to the yellawolf concert youll start listening..
Hardy
How much for the truck?
Great song…💕
Her ass looks like it was nailed on!!!!
Terrible song and wow, is she dramatic in this one?
Yes it’s better that you fool your in hell now
2024 and still listening to this wishing theyd drop longer versions and more duets together. Regardless of how many times Ive heard this, it still hits deep within my soul. This song in general is incredible but they took it above and beyond with their emotions.
I ended up having to run away to the Army to save myself. No one would believe me, family, friends, no one. He was too “perfect” for anyone to accept he was abuse as hell…  Love this song anyway.
Lainey got a dump truck I wanna wait in
Dylan Austin I love 💖 you to be at the same place for
I’m rather convinced I’m a country singer
Dylan Austin I will have a r and
by far the best version of this song
Dylan Austin I love e I have a ee in the hospital for a bit and the last one is going to the last time you got it and the kids
I wish he had be there for me in 1986. In Kinston NC
Dylan Austin why are you going out to be at your boss today and a week of work and the
Dylan Austin why do I want you to be friends 😭 you and the kids
Luke is the kids to be friends right there and I don't have to
Hardy u are a good singer and song writer...keep up that good work..I love this song.....
Luke said he's a new phone number and the boys and a lot of the other ones that I will be in a lot more
This is amazing  song . My Dad was there for me.
Well THANK U COMMUNITY OF JOSHUA TREE AND SAN BURNADINO COUNTY OF EVIL FOR TURNING ON THE COMMENTS AGAIN. I HAVE SOME MORE TO UNVEIL TO MY PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THEY CAN GET AWAY FROM STEALING AND SLAVING ME OUT. SEE THIS BAG WHORE EARNIE GARCIA AKA BUDDA WHO IS RICH WITH HIS LEFT HAND OUT JUST LIKE JUSTIN BEIBER AKA BONES SAMS MARKET WHO DOES NOT ITEM EYES THE THINGS U PURCHASE. TWO SODAS FOR FOUR DOLLARS AND A SMALL BAG OF CHIPS IS MAKING UP YOUR OWN LAWS. STEALING IS HELL. AND MOTEL SIX THIS IS THE SECOND TIME U ROBBED ME IN TWENTY NINE PALMS CALI. I DIDNT PAT FOR DOG POOP ON THE FLOOR, I DIDNT HAVE A DIG AND IN FIVE MINUTES OF BEING BAREFOOT IN YOUR DIRTY RIOMS I TURNED BLACK ON THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET. SO NEXT TIME U PAUSE YOUR COMMENTS FROM TRUTH KNOW I EXPOSE EVIL I DO NOT HIDE IT. THANK JASON FOR ALLOWING ME TO EXPOSE ON YOUR CHANNEL. ANY HELP I CAN GET TO GET MY MONEY BACK WOULD BE APPRECIATE AS THE ENEMY GOT ALL MY SSI YET AGAIN. BLESSINGS FROM ME TO U
Thank for making this song, I needed it.
Luke and a lot 😀 and the boys and I will get together for you to the boys are we still on for dinner
Dylan and a new job and the boys
Oh my goodness❤
Hardy is iyricist, a brilliant storytelling.  Lainey should be in the HOF now.  Incredible performance, mesmerizing.

NOPE, dumbest song ever! should be called "i'm a dumb cuck". some dipshit commits murder for some chick with zero backstory or knowledge of what actually happened??? really, yer that dumb huh? So what if he beat her ass for drowning their children and she got away before the police showed up?( which happens more than you want to know) or what if She was the abuser and the poor bastard you murdered was acting in self defense? "then she stole my truck, and i'm a dumb cuck"  in prison for life! yea DUMBEST F'n song ever...
Lainey Wilson sounds amazing

Thank you for singing a song Like this Many don't know what women go threw with a man that does this to women  and not many can get away   small town cops don't do anything turn there heads
Sometimes ya gott look hard for thd wings lol
My daddy beat my mom so much.  This song kills me.  I remember one of the last times he did it before she left him.  TheY blasted out the front door and my dad picked up a 4 foot tall iron plant holder and hit her in the shins with it.  She fell to the ground and he picked up her purse and started beating her with it.  I was 10 years old and finally got the courage to pick my skateboard up and threaten to hit him in the head with it so he let her go.  we left and moved back to TX that night.  He found her and i in Palestine TX a year after that and drug her out of the house by her hair.  If I wouldn’t have left with him that night then he would have killed her.  This song fucks me up every time.  I wish I could have saved her from all that.

Lainy is very pretty. Love her outfit and great singing. Hardy is really good too. ❤❤❤❤
Bit_h, Leave
I live in deep in Alabama. Im59. Only been on social media maybe a few years. I never realized how protected I had been raised. Thank you my only God. People abusing everyone from children to themselves and people. Living and praising for the material things. Sell your own children. Kids killing parents. Vice versa. Wake up. Just like so many movies.i believe it was Shakespeare, not sure nobody is in hell. The demons are here collecting souls. Every week something new. To make you want it. courosty kills. Faith.
She dated my brother I've never myself met her never listened to her music until this song what a dumb ass my brother was. He is an actor I'm not so to be honest I don't really no him either. But to lady Gaga thank u for this song, and I really mean thank you.
What an amazing song
This song hits hard. Real men still exist.
This song touches my heart.😢
If we had more of this justice, the world would be a much better place !!!! The strong are supposed to protect the weak !!!!
My wife and I were married for ten years before we finally got are little girl and I didn't know I could be as happy as I am now
Why i am crying
Who sings this? My God what a combo. Great song, kicking ass on assholes in this world.  Hits to heart but it's true. Sadly our world is full of Damm Asses like this. I met my share 72 tears worth. Love you guys Fred Rodriguez small town Mexican living in a fast paced world.  Amen
She owes all her success to those 2 MASSIVE CHEEKS 😂😂😂
Awesome  song❤
Very true, people don’t want to get involved, wish I had someone who cared enough before my bf broke 11 bones in my body 🥹🥹🥹
How did The Dance not make this list?
Love the song and the performance.........But geez that early 70's Chevy or GMC, not sure, is a beauty......
Bad ass right there. Perfection.
Geez. She’s horrible.
This songs story is what happens when the simp chooses violence lol
I can’t stop listening to this song.
Now thats a real man, layin down his life to administer justice, ay the exact time needed scarified his life cuz that life needed to be saved! He was an angel on a mission.
Nnnn
Who else would love to see Lainey do a remake of Fancy???
My song ❤
cant help but gear a little bit of reba in her voice lol
This young lady is something special!!
Beautiful work by the amazing artists
❤❤
I am a old lady and i know color means nothing.  Our LORD AND SAVIOR LOVES ALL OF US.❤ THANK YOU JESUS ❤❤
2:43
Good American Country music😅❤❤❤ 4stars She's got. It going on.
I feel the same way about my wife
Sounds great and powerful Voice
This is what country music has become? Life has passed me by..smh 😢
This is an absolutely beautiful song and video
Saw him last night with son in tinley! Hands down was memorable night I’ll never forget ❤
Been me 😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅🎉😂
That's not the truck from the video 😢
For it being a live show the sound quality is great😂
Great collaboration. Hope they will do more songs together.
I love Hardy! Him and Lainey are amazing ❤
I'd wait in that DUMPTRUCK forever.
WOW!!! MY NIECE TURNED ME ON TO THIS SONG TODAY & ALL Ì CAN SAY IS WOW!!! GREAT WORK!!! Ì FELT THAT WAY MYSEĹF WHEN A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP LIKE THIS ONE . THERE WERE TIMES I FELT LIKE TAKING CARE OF IT BUT I HSD KIDS TO RAISE AND THROUGH OUT THE YEARS THESE SO CALLED MEN HAVE MET JÙSTICE OF THEIR OWN MAKING. I TRY NOT ÞO TAKE PLEASURE IN THEIR DEMISE.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Very nice song but as ART ALWAYS imitates life, The woman got treated how she ALLOWED a drunk to treat  her. EVERY woman that gets hit MORE than ONE time , by the same dude, brought it on herself. Walking away is easy . You allow people to abuse you, that's on YOU.
One of the sexiest songs of all time!! 🔥🔥 It gives me hope that there are still some real men left out there who haven’t been completely emasculated by modern society.
It will be 4weeks Friday my son died in but my granddaughter and me both came out not hurt well I will never be the same again 😂
Survivor of domestic violence here and an x that was a stalker. This gave me chills
Jeeze. She’s so fake
👏👏🇧🇷
Sexy thick.
Hardy
Wish I had met him years ago!
I love Hardy from all the way over in Sweden! 😍👌
In Panama City Florida, there's a bunch of purty ladies 🥰🤠🤠🤠.     Ok, I love the ladies 🤠, but with respect 🤠🤠🤠🥰.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Fuckin amazing
LOVE THIS DUET❤❤❤❤
Born and raised in the South.  Stopped listening to country music about ‘05 because it sucked.  This is so refreshing. A song, a story, a message…awesome.   This guy kicks ass.   And Lainey Wilson. Wow. Gotta admit that I figured her for another pretty face.  But I believe her. If that makes sense.  She’s got a genuine quality about her and it comes through in her voice.  I figure 20 years from now we’ll be talkin bout how she’s still at it.
I appreciate that he sounds just as good live as recorded.
This song reminds me of my dumass step dad and the way he tried my mom and my sister  and I'm not going to let my kids grow up and not be a bulley to women  ❤
Show the button 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😢 good morning beautiful lady Gary Robinette some one I will never get to see you
Drop the mike so special
This would be a great song if he had a better female singer to work with. She really sucks.
So sexy
This always gave me chills since it came out such a great song..
That was good
They should at least have the right truck in this video as the original just saying
Love 🎉this 😊
I love her voice too much jerking like idk...like a dude ...
I can hear Trump saying to America---Just wait in the truck !
This is definitely in my top 5 favorite songs EVER. I was raised if you ever see a woman being wronged...fix it.  Can you end you life for a woman you don't know?
This Is Instant Justice For Every Man That Hits A Woman..
Love This!!!! ❤
Hunter
2 1/2 years of being homeless me and my ex-husband living in a van in Madison Tennessee is enough for me almost 60 years old don't know what to do can't get a job because I can't afford a room or a house or an apartment the song just seems to fit us because since we've been homeless we've drank more than we ever have and drugs will you guessed it the song touches us
BEAUTIFUL 😊
We're can you get bellbonts
Wow I wish I owned that truck
Great Country 👍 ❤❤❤
Hauntingly familiar. Thank you
Should have asked her why she wasn't in the kitchen,  women can't deal with space or thought so much
I hear so much Reba in Lainey, incredible voice!
This Truck!!
Gyatt
What's the hat he's wearing?
You are my favorite singer I am his daughter but you are my favorite singer you're the best singer in the world I think you are my first Morgan wallen's my second Taylor Swift's my third and I'm going to say jelly rolls my fifth but I think you're the best singer in the world
Ohhhh my goodness
Absolutely awesome
i love this but i watched the 2023 performance and hardy improved out of sight his voice was so much more refined but i loved this one won as much coz was raw
BBLs in country music now too?
Love Lainey and Hardy
Excellent!!
Sad that he killed some guy for this chick and went to prison and didn't get to tap that ass!
I Honestly Love this song it hits deep
Absolutely LOVE thàt song and that OLE' CHEVY as well !!!
Okay...whoever decided to have these two sing this song together is a genius....two artists with clearly God given voices...just amazing....Lainey Wilson is just beautiful, Michael Wilson Hardy and Lainey are amazing performers together and separately...hope they do more collaboration because they are truly meant to sing together.
Country is back!! Thanks to Hardy and Lainey!! May God bless y'all both🙏🤠
She can ABSOLUTELY F***KING SING!!!!!
Deflated butt
I love love this song! Awesome Job to both of you!! ❤️❤️
When this song first came out my queen said you got to hear this song, just saying im a MARINE and she looked me dead in my eyes and said you always got me right, shit my life for aint nothing without her in it
Being under abused woman this is like the best song with the emotion and the outcome. I wish someone had told me to wait in the truck even though the man who did this to me is dead. I forgive him and that’s all that counts. It is what it is my choice.
My God - this is brilliant
Holy hell! That was epic! I know the American Idol folks are hiding their faces kicking Lainey off the show! Idiots! Epic performance she can sing anything! ❤❤❤
I need to know the full story behind this song..
A metalhead here and somehow I've found Hardy and Chris Stapleton and these guys are about the only country I can stand but man they are both amazing and Lainey has some pipes on her...if these 3 are the only country I ever listen too I'll be happy
Hardy and Lainey is two of the hottest singers and performers in Music today I love both of their music my hat goes off to them  both!!!!
Been there but no caught. The look in her eyes. Cops were called to a no body. I walked away.
Damn just damn this tells a story that I think most men in the south have thought about. Straight up that is exactly how it would happen.
Love this as a survivor of domestic violence I can relate
I’d like to think I’m a good person but in this circumstance, he would have had to go. Girl, “Just wait in the truck”, I’ve got your back. I will handle this.
❤❤❤Lainey is such a beautiful cutie wit a booty
we called area Glenn and Campbell now
👠💯💯
i love story telling country music
This reminds me of my first marriage. I wish I would have had a hero like this song describes. I rescued myself.
It's always worth the time to protect a woman or child
Smoke some dope and become a hero in your own mind,hardly can't tie his own boots
I Love You Your Music ❤Hardy Lainey Wilson ♥
"I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes, waiting for the cops to come." Based AF.
NO DISRESPECT  TO ANYONE! they wrote & sang this song & omg!! BUT HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE!! BUT that's the point they have I have!!
I was that woman but NO ONE defended me!! I wish I had a defender! Took karate but my ex husband beat my ass 4 yrs!! I HAVE A 15 UR OLD DAUGHTER...GOD LORD HELP EVERY1!!!
I loved it 3:07
Amazing ❤stay you , your real ❤ ty
Mic drop 👏🏿🎤
Them two can saaaang !!
Truly awesome song if she did not try to over power the gentleman singing be a lady.💯💜✝️
I never thought my day of justice would come from a judge underneath a seat....omg. pure gold!!
Gives me chills every time. Brilliant song by brilliant singer/songwriters.
Now this is country music. This brought me back to the old school country music I listened to growing up.
The new Jones and Wynette❤❤
They are awesome ❤
Never knew Lainey Wilson in the song, I always like that song 😅
Uhh...enjoy prison I guess. Great vocals...weird lyrics with irrational outcome, but I suppose some dude could go vigilante.
We all want a knight in shining armor
And i wished there was a man like that around here for the man that knocked my teeth out, and theother one that beat me in the head with his fist and drug me throu four rooms in a house
I love this song so much 😊 do yall love this song😊
YES!!!!!
✨️🌹👍 Super job goes Out to the both of you. Great job.👍🌹✨️
this song makes me wanna cry :')
He said just wait the truck .. endeavor got hit again
The perfect song.  they are good together.   Lainey is so beautiful
Extraordinary
My Beast Thank you for Saving me.Forever love at first sight My Hero My Soulmate
Thank you for being a good man and opening up your door🕊
Great Song I've now seen both versions. The official music video and this one. Something interesting though, on the official music video, he's driving a Ford in this version, it's a Chevy.
Hardy tho 😋
Use this as a Lainey Wilson got a dump truck button
Love this song! ❤
God shes terrible.... Hardy picked the wrong one.
Pop
Its givng martina mcbride independence day but with a good dude to help
Um. Have the LIGHTS GONE OUT IN GEORGIA YET. FUCK YA ALL
Hey. Michelle Wilson. Look who craweled out the WITCHES DOOR
Sing it Ms Lainey and Hardy!
Beautiful song!
The best song yet! A true story! I didn't have hardy, just my brother that grabbed my 1 year old son as I grabbed a lead pipe on that pos dash😢, after he tried beating the crap out of me, my  hardy was that lead pipe, I was 5"9 140#, that pos was 6'5" 300# ya, pos was thinking have mercy on him! My dad, firechief, called the cops, after I got done, his cop friend said nope she fu..ed him up bad, not that he did fu.. me up, I got a broken nose, wrist, forearm, and a shattered cheak bone, he, after I got done, busted nose, jaw, 3 ribs, and a concussion, so... just saying..... fight back! Break the damn domestic violence cycle!
This is a story with notes!
She sounds like dolly Parton
Fab this , how country shud be
Real country....ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
I thought she was supposed to wait in the truck.
Abuse is real and intil we aren’t scared of men it’s gonna keep on happening
How is that idiot with glasses even country.
The world is screwed, these people that think they sing country nowadays are just losers that can’t make it and pop! And people actually think this is good music. Whatever happened to Alan Jackson Martina McBride Reba McEntire Suzy Bogguss Kathy Mattea all the greats Mary Chapin Carpenter. We’re stuck with all these losers I can’t dress Kent saying and don’t even have a clue of how to act
These 2, this song, thank you, for acknowledging domestic violence! I should of went to jail, beat his ass, after he beat me, and held me by the hair over my son, trying to leave him, in front of my parents, some how got a hold of a lead pipe on the dashboard, my brother ran out, i said grab my son then my 5'8" l55# proceeded to beat the f out of his 6'4" 240# ass, my brother pulled me off him, cops got called, umm dad was fire dept, they knew him and me, said umm cant arest him, he looks and is worse then me, he broke my cheek, nose, and wrist, i broke his jaw, nose, ribs, so... did what i did cause he tried killing me, my son, the lead pipe was hardy! So thank you both for this song! This song gives me the chills! Love you guys.
This is my favorites song he should have never went to jail he saved her life
This! My god these two are unbelievable 🔥
Wow this dude is perfect live.
This is country music and its purest form
This song is it….never lay your hand on a women.
Family
That's when God arrives
Rare brown eyes chick loved
And you ain’t never lied!
Country music is the leading genre all over the world. Nobody wants to hear that talentless rap and pop in this modern world.... laney Wilson you are an absolute godess sweetheart.
This is the old school type of great country songs that kick a$$ movies are based on!
A beautiful woman 2:38
3:03 angel
What a story, judge under the seat took care of business
Beautiful!!!
This shit is ripping. These vocals! I have been playing this on guitar multiple times throughout the past two weeks.
What an idiot. All he had to say is he went to confront the guy and he grabbed a gun and he acted in self defense.
This is exactly why they don’t try that in a small town
I've said it before, but I'll say it again... It's been a long time since a song about vigilante justice became a hit. Let's make this happen, folks!
HEY HARD TELL LAINEY I LOVE HER 😊
This is what the CMAs used to be!
❤❤❤❤ love this song. Thank you Hardy for highlighting a huge problem so many refuse to even see. It's unreal how many people watched my ex hit or hurt me and turned around or blamed me. Nice to see not everyone agrees with that mentality!!!! This song is powerful!
A few memories😢💯💯🤘🤘
REDNECKS NEVER DIE!!! 🔥🔥🔥 YEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAWW!!! 🔥🤘🏻
If there was an absolutely love button I’d be allllllllover it ! Str8 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!!! Real men are hard to come by but I’ve raised 3 sooooo there’s a few ❤💯💯💯💯
Those vocals are amazing 🤩 on both ends omg!!
That girl can FREAKIN SANNNNNG!!!!
i just cant get with him giving his life up and not even knowing what she did to get a tune up like that !
cliff jones lesson to be learned google
🎉 o'caalaacccccccccccc❤😮opussy
Not too lie too you and not too tell you no are the first two sentences the night we met at the gas station before going to your room
I w u too know i can't get those days and nights out of my heart
Such a kick ass duet.... this day and age vigilante justice is way to go
Omg I love that song & the video is pure genius. Their duo singing it is electric! Despite subject matter it's superb!
Laney is the best I love you girl keep it up
❤🎉❤🎉❤
❤ 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
Had no idea he was from my home state . MISSISSIPPI ❤
Amazing song, vocals, their voices, and the creme de la creme, Hardy's wailing high notes towards the end! Shivers!!! 😍❤️‍🔥🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Should have had her back up singer on stage as well
#dumptruck
Love it❤❤😅
I like Lainey Wilson and Hardy when they say white in the truck ❤❤❤❤❤

Got more of Hardy here on my playlist 💜 https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGRpUrsoqwGx8VRGoX0MJeGYeYW7RvEJH&si=2UCMU5B83N5b0-wL
He’s the hero I wanted/needed years ago. ❤
this song gives me goosebumps and I don't even like country
Bet Hardy got distracted by that Lainey booty out the corner of his eye. I know I would, sheesh.
Better with a Big Mac truck in vid
Chris Brown
Man that is 1 beautiful woman and a voice of an angel
Lainey Wilson maybe new but she has that old country grit in her voice... You don't hear that anymore.
Ok nobody is going to mention the truck on stage so I will…that Chevy is sweet af
Wow wow wow! The song and those 2 together sent this rendition through the stratosphere!! Shivers and goosebumps, then the cremé de la cremé is Hardy's last loudest,  anguished deep wailing of "Lord ........." around 3:53 to 3:57 time stamp, while Lainey is singing the other line of "Have mercy have mercy on me.." This is almost the very end of their stunning performance and the ending is epic!
Damn that Lainey Wilson is HOT 🔥🔥🔥🔥
God Bless all of are serves members and thank you for your  service. WELCOME HOME WISHING YOU LOVE AND HUGS WITH SOME PEACE  WITH HELP❤❤
That last Hardy scream that turned into a beautiful melody.  Damn.
Having been in a marriage that I was a victim of a lot of dv This song has even more meaning to us that I don’t know unless you lived it that you will truly understand but thank you it’s like you’re reading our mind
Lainey sure loves her bell-bottoms she definitely wanted to stand out different from the rest of the country women
This song and  Save Me with Jelly Roll are both good songs. Credit to Hardy and Jelly for writing them but the duos with Lainey make them great.
This is absolutely amazing 😢They for sure their not fake.Its real life song
not to mention that she is hot AF, wel both of them

I love this song it tells the true story about this song.
Such amazing song i love it
Man oh man that woman has some pipes I love listening to her sing
Country music....wtf happened to you.
This is the best they got? 😂 sad
Bro Brantley Gilbert and hardy and Jason aldean in a song together WOULD BE FIRE!!!
Bro I remember seeing this performance.. it was one the best performances I’ve ever since in country music
I was and abused child and woman, great great great song. Should have won A TROPHY  AT THE CMA.
Such a fantastic  song❤❤❤
Luv’d this👌 Lainey Wilson is very talented! Luv her voice! I think her voice is the best female voice out there right now!!! So much talent out there but sure luv her voice!!!!!
OMG LOVE LOVE LOVE❤❤❤
if you are a man and this song hits deep there is no doubt on the things you would do to protect the ones you love. There is a reason you have chill bumps and that knot in your chest. Good people do exist and you are likely one of them.
I love This song that Hardy Co-Wrote!!!!
Don't think I'd stuck around for the cops to come
hes a woman stealer i'm seein but can't do nothing bout it he's dang lucky
Damn she's gotta dump truck.
Love Hardy. He is the greatest music artist in my book.
As a survivor of domestic violence I pray that this song sheds light on ways for women to get out… I hear every  kind of Rights; except for spousal abuse and support. Trust me I have had it hard but I hope that this beautiful song and video will shed light on how hard it is to get out while being threatened with your life. Tears and heart wrenching!!! Thank you for this amazing song. 🥲😇❤️
This is a good song 🤩 if you've never heard of it lession to it and you might like it.
Everytime he hits them highs on have mercy on me I get goosebumps and tears. What a song
Fux with hardy heavy. Him and Lainey make an amazing team
BE A REAL MAN. RIGHT HERE
Anyone else bugged by the TV satellite dish being hung wrong

Wow freaking amazing absolutely love this song the two best people I think are singing it the one verse Wilson's voice sounds just like it could be Elle King absolutely phenomenal this song write all the way down to the vocals amazing!!!❤❤❤❤❤️‍🔥

John Anderson
One of the best stories ever told thru a song.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Finally another old men in black country song. I thought these type of song writers have long since died out.
❤❤
Just try to keep the tears in the eyes.
❤
Thanks for giving a voice to so many with whisky scars
what ever that but and my truck  lets go
What a great duet.❤❤❤❤
Absolutely can relate to this song. Its absolutely beautiful. Thank you for giving us such amazing music. ❤❤❤❤
Lyrics Enjoy   I got turned around in some little town I'd never been to before Working my way through a middle-of-June Midnight thunderstorm There was something in the headlights It stopped me on a dime Well, she was scared to death, so I said "Climb in, " and then she climbed Oh, yeah Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe With a tear in her blood-stained shirt She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to I knew what had happened to her I didn't load her down with questions That girl had been through enough I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes And I asked her where he was I don't know if he's an angel 'Cause angels don't do what he did He was hellbent to find the man behind All the whiskey scars I hid I never thought my day of justice Would come from a judge under a seat But I knew right then I'd never get hit again When he said to me "Wait in the truck Just wait in the truck" Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came So I kicked in his double-wide door I let the hammer drop before he got To that 12 he was reaching for I didn't try to hide my pistol I didn't even try to run I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes And waited for the cops to come I don't know if he's an angel 'Cause angels don't do what he did He was hellbent to find the man behind All the whiskey scars I hid I never thought my day of justice Would come from a judge under a seat But I knew right then I'd never get hit again When he said to me "Wait in the truck Just wait in the truck" Whoa (whoa) Have mercy on me, Lord Have mercy on me Have mercy on me (hey), Lord It's been 60 months and she still comes To see me from time to time It was worth the price, to see a brighter side Of the girl I picked up that night And I might be here forever It ain't paradise, that's true But it's whole hell of a lot better Than the place I sent him to, yeah Wait in the truck (have mercy on me) Just wait in the truck (Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) Wait in the truck (Lord, have mercy) Just wait in the truck have mercy on me, Lord Have mercy on me (Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) have mercy on me, Lord Have mercy on me (Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) wait in the truck Just wait in the truck (Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) wait in the truck Just wait in the truck (please have me mercy)
What I would love most, more than anything, is to be the man of this song, and My 6 million non-Muslim non-Arab, Hebrew People Israel to be whom I told "Wait in the truck..."
Those haunting words...wait in the truck...great song
The fact hardy called her and was like "this is probably the best song being written and i want you on it" is incrdible.
Been a long time since I heard a country song that moved me the way a Hank Williams or Cash song does. That’s what country needs.
Ladies and gents, we are witnessing the rise of a country legend.  Rock on Hardy.
Ran across this song accidentally one day while working. Hooked on it now. That line "i never thought my day of justice would come from a judge under a seat." Did it for me
Chris, Thank You!
This song hits me so hard. Every time. So Beautiful. ❤❤❤
WOW!!!Just WOW!!!!
Omg this is the life song 4 me 10yr I done over it😊np love it
Her voice is amazing,  literary brought tears to my eyes and I'm a grown azz man.. Great Song  !
This song makes me cry every time I hear it.  What I wouldn't have given for someone like that in my time of need
Man!!! That's a good song!!
The girl is super hot but she likes fords .
being an abused woman this song hit close to home and there aren’t enough people that care enough to get involved. BRAVO
Wow! Just wow! On a side note... He looks a lot like Zak Bagans. Lol. A lot more talented then Zac!!
Need more of this.
Hardys Last Lord note at end of song, Got me to looking to Hardy and man im so glad it did. Awesome writer,the words just hit you,so relatable. Going to see him and Lainey next month and am so excited..my bromance..lol
Wow This song hits me so hard I wish I had someone in my life that could have done that for me  Thank you So much i listen to this song so many times when i have that day  Thank you
She is so gorgeous!
❤Y’all Just don’t forget! I love all y’all, and I’d (WE, our team) /we would do it all over again.
I'm an English 45 year old poet want to be and having discovered Hardy a few weeks back would like to say this song is beautiful and brilliant thank you Hardy and Lainey
What a song!!!!!
For some odd reason I love this song. Well done to both of the Artists and the songwriters!!
This some shit ❤
GhattDayum what a GREAT song!!!
Love how Lainey plays the song. It’s a serious deep song and she and hardy treat it as such
She needs to feat Post Malone

I like the song and it's message, well done.
No joke...high power...blew her arm off...in a kitchen...25 years EMS

Love this song
Love this song so powerful you can feel it
I love this song,  I only heard it last year. And it seemed ever time I got into the car it would come on.
does lainey carry a cdl
Just found this song a couple weeks ago, and it has been stuck in my head.  This song single-handedly made me want to check out modern country music, after 40 years on this earth.  So dope, my man! It’s a modern classic, for sure.
Idk why but this is my new fav song for now her voice is amazing
I like the meth blinds on the trailer
Why she always make devils sign
This is a true story I was down there leaving Laineys farm. When I went through that town. We didn't see each other until bout 2 years ago after my mom and brother passed and told me she was going   tell our story I'm so thankful ❤️ my sunflower we will always be eachothers 1ST I didn't know if I she wanted me still around after that night  happened 😢❤😢😢
Great topic everyone needs a hero 👏 🙌 amazing job guys!! 👏 Dana
Absolute Gold that!!!!! 👏👏👏
Awesome song you both work great together on this song!! Great performance!!!!!!!!! Holding on to the sound of country music is awesome!!!!!!!!
oh my gosh I love that song it always bring tears to my eyes
First time seeing this and Hardy. They both have amazing voices!  I am now a fan.
I could listen to this song all day long...every day... every night!!!😊. Unbelievable arrangement... unbelievable music... unbelievable singing 😊 Getting chills!
If he never writes another song…. He will be known for writing the the greatest most powerful songs ever
If you're from the Hollars and the mountains then we know.
ME AND MY NANA LOVE WAIT IN THE TRUCK ITS MY 4th fav conutry song!
Men out there, Don't ever hit your woman or there will be a payback !!
Damn just damn!
one hell of a dump truck
In a community where the public services reflect the people the justice should have come from the town owned Glock on his hip.
They brought country back to its roots.
Dam they work good together
Cringe ass song 💀
She was against all racism/sexist/religious bs.  Not just that but abuse against all.  Im a huge fan of Halsey, who does stand up against a lot of the bs, but Sinéad went a step above anything I’ve ever seen.  RIP Sinéad your my personal hero!
One of the best songs I've ever listened to.
Great song,Great new singers too.
They nailed this song. Love the emotion you feel from it. Great Job Hardy and Lainey
Love you why don't you stand with Aldean I won't listen to you again

lainey wilson is gorgeous 🤭😍🔥
Love you all 💖😜
I love the song that song is the reason I upset for women
Any true man would do the same thing. Any other guy is just a boy pretending to be a man. Being a man isn’t something that happens at a certain age. You either get it or you don’t, if you don’t then get out of the way so the real men can work boy.
Whoa!!! & Wow!!!
wow incredible
That truck tho 😍
Love it
Ah yes glorifying murder
I love this song but this live version kinda sucks. She looks high
Just a gittin it ain't they 😊❤
My Lord,me and a girl that I know sing this one and I think it sounds good no matter
Beautiful song.  These two are amazing. Their vocals are everything.  I could listen to these two sing all day long. Two of the best country music 🎶 artists out there.  Lainey's voice I so sooooo lovvvvveeeee!!!!💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖I'm glad & happy that these two amazing artists are getting the recognition that they deserve. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ #HARDY #LAINEYWILSON  #Waitinthetruck
❤🔥🙏
I have a personal knowledge of the judge under the seat. 😉
So he killed someone for hitting a woman? Thats kinda extreme 😅 he a gangsta
Hardy makes videos and doesn't pay his extras.
What an emotional song. Beautiful.
Hell ya I  50 years young  this  song is bad ass real shit
This song can be sung in any music style. Would love to hear the RnB version
I have loved this song for like 3 years and its my nuber 1 fave
Lainey and hardy this one is my favorite. I love how you two collaborate. Amazing and this is so true and a vice for people that are less aware. I love you two! #OklahomaSouth #Statboy
Good god how I LOVE THESE TWO SINGERS,! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! HAVE NOT HEARD A SONG THAT GRABBED MY SOUL IN A LONG LONG TIME!! BEEN WAITING FOR THIS A VERY LONG TIME!!
Kinda reminds me of Martina McBride, Awesome ❤
Honest...angry even perhaps? no joke here. No glam. Just Country.
One Good Man With  A Good Heart
Any story telling from Jay Z to Cash.  This is great art
yeah, wait in the truck
“ justice came from a judge under the seat”😎
Darn Good Song
Does anyone else hear the rattling?
❤
Great song and artist
Lainey wilson is hot af
Im way to on see with hardy lainy Wilson and best Morgan wallen
I love country music
Best country duo song in over 20 years, I get chills every time I hear it.
It would be amazing to see a sequel to this song, the end of the video showed potential for one.  I got a she breaking him out vibe!!!❤️❤️
I never get tired of this song. The performance these 2 put on is incredible. This is what music is supposed to be about. Telling a story & putting emotion into to get your listeners invested.
I got a heart like a fart we kill inmecent so I can sing n my dad can golf I'm a whore I'm no hier I was raised to be a bitch ! Is the real lyrics
I love this song
Being a songwriter, it just comes to me, God Bless.
love songs
Eggzaclaity
Amazzing
My Guy Hardy Rep,n The Sipp Just Fine...
I flippin love it. You both did an amazing job and she came and killed it again! Girl you are something special!🩷
I don't like how they don't look at each other
Right peaceful laws do take car of it in the beginning middle and end oh holy knights thank you 🙏🏼 of coming so brightly. To know that have prayered.
It's funny listening to all these people who can't stand Florida-Georgia line because they're not "real country" don't realize that HARDY wrote several of their hits. They are actually good friends with each other.
💜
Thats how its done ladies and gentlemen!
Wilson looks absolutely amazing here but she has lost so much weight now😢
Good song. The guy sounds a bit like Steve Earle (That's a good thing) - and  I am already a fan of Lainey so it's a good combination.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You gotta love country music!!!
I love that song
Best duet everrrrrrrrrrrrrr
This song hits me hard.  Love it
So many miss the judge from under the seat
Love the story love the singers give me chills because I might do something like I world do
Came cross this one wanted check it out  👍
people need to recognize the talent that these 2 have. the passion and pain in their voices to really convey the lyrics and story of this song is impressive!
I've never heard a live that almost sounds better then recording
As  DVS survior.I thank you for this song.God Bless You Both!❤
Imagine God's driving that truck.
And the CMA Entertainer of the year 2023 goes too ….. Lainey Wilson 🤞🤠👏👏
No broken PFAs or liberal judges who do nothing to prevent killers of the abused. The “ judge” underneath the seat has its place at times. Great country song!
Thank you Christopher
Wow this hits me so hard.  😪this is the past 30 years of my life.  💚💚
I do agree this is a good song, especially for  survivors. I am a woman, I work with some of this, we forget men are also abused. Neither should put hands on each other, but I've seen women beat the crap out of a man trying to get away. I am sure I will get a lot of crap for saying this. Most men never report an abuser because it is a woman.
Unreal
Omg epic performance ❤❤❤❤❤
That is one heck of a song whether you like Country music or not!!!
i am 55 an my life at home was like this my mom got beat all the time it hits the heart for sure
Lainey giving me Selena at Astrodome flashbacks with those pants.
Gives me Reba McEntire vocals
Can we get a permanent GoPro on Lainey’s butt 😅😂 Good Lawd
why isnt anyone talking about 3:50
Oh my God
I freaking love this song. This is exactly where I’m at and where I’ve been in what I’m leaving or what I should say I already left.
This song touches my inner soul and I like it 100% Perfect To all who put this together ..... lainey We ilson keep on shining like a " DIAMOND "
Love this song so much great job 👍
😢
I love Lainey ❤️ and I hope she knows just how much I love her ❤️ she is very beautiful there is nobody else like her in the world 🌎 I love her more than anyone can ever imagine ❤️ ♥️ 💖 💕 💗 💜 ❤️ ♥️ 💖 💕 💗 💜 ❤️ ♥️ 💖 💕 💗 💜 ❤️ ♥️ 💖 💕 💗 💜 ❤️ ♥️ 💖 💕 💗 💜 ❤️ ♥️ 💖 💕 💗 Lainey if you see this I love you baby keep safe OK baby
Yea, this story makes a ton of sense - you're going to go kill someone for someone you don't know, never met before in a town you've never been to.  Then is't sung by a female that has the fakest country accent I've ever heard.    It's sad this is the "best" country music has to offer these days.  This is sad.
I love this song as a 67 year old woman! Thank you Lainey; I love your style and message!
Cant wait to see and hear live at Saratoga this summer love your music .
YESSS DV Survivor x 2 .. Never again..
This is country music!!!!
When a southern boy tells you to wait in the truck..........you wait...Solid.💯💣🤟
I heard this song for the first time last night. It took me back to when I was 14 and my mommas husband won she was introduced to while he was in prison by his mother for a pen pal. Little did we know the monster who was really gonna show his true colors when he got out and moved into my home. I begged her and begged her to leave him but she was too afraid of him. I wasn't. I was mean as hell to little did he know. I was 16 by now and met him at the back door of MY HOUSE, I grabbed both sides of the door frame, bent my knee up to my chest and when he opened the door he got my right cow girl boot right in the middle of his chest and he landed on his back at the bottom of those three steps. I told him if he ever stepped foot back in my home or came near me and my momma again that I would make sure that they put him under the prison when he went back. He had this look in his eye like What just happened!?!?! He could see that I wasn't afraid of him so he got up eagle to his truck and left. I thank God every single day for having the courage to have done that for my momma. And this song right here made me smile for being my mommas  angel that night.
What a powerful song
Im back. 😊
It's a great by hardy she just uses her body way to much ..... every video I've seen of hers she's using her body one way or another always pointing her butt towards the camera or the crowd...... yeah I'm good no thanks
❤
This is heavy as aic & soundgarden. 👊🏼
I get chills every single time I hear this song. Well written, beautifully sang, love everything about it. Hardy is such a talented young man and can tell one hell of a story. Lainey is very talented as well, absolutely love her!
Thank you. I know what it feels like. No man came to my defense.
Gives me a whole new respect for Hardy & I’ve loved Lainy since she done Never Say Never but this song I fell in love with when I heard it the first time!! Congratulations to u both.
I ain’t going to prison for a dumb girl too stupid to leave.
I think Lainey Wilson has the best female voice out there right now. You go girl. She also just won two awards at the CMA awards.
This is the worst thing Iv heard in a long time
Lainey is the new Queen
I love your songs❤❤❤❤
Well, basically it's not a country song. It's God's top priority. Because females are the treasures of the universe. It's a crime against God if one girl or woman is mistreated, injured or killed...
This song really his home after spending 7 years in the pin for manslaughter for a man putting his hands on a woman
❤ty
Laney is my girl,
Congrats HARDY & Lainey - the best song that hits home for so many. Some people want to bring it down - NOT gonna happen it tells a story the world needs to hear.
I thought is was that guy from ghost adventures.
There is a gun that has the judge engraved on the barrel. Nice gun. Shoots 2 different kinds of ammo.
After you shot him you could have covered him up so she couldnt see him. Then you could've taken her in to pack all her stuff. Then put put all her stuff in the truck. Then poured gas all over and burn the place to the ground.  You didn't have to wait for the cops to come. You could have given her a new start someplace else. But I guess this is what makes a country song.
I'm a rocker, love it!!
Amazing song!
This is an excellent song.  It's touched many,  including myself, but it gets so much better when you keep your eyes on Jesus.  God heals it all! Last it down and walk away. He's got a plan for your life better than you could ever imagine. Obey, Trust,  and leave all the consequences to him. I love you Father God. I've laid it all down at your feet and it all feels good.  Only you know me and only you know what you have waiting for me.  Thank you Father.  😇❤️‍🔥✝️
A song to think about I have hit once and told him I kill him but I pack a bag and left my life was worth more than his ......left everything  but ME.....I I'll do it again......
Chills, every damn time
Friends don't let friends drive Chevrolet "trucks" 👍🏼😉
This is the voice of domestic abuse. Awesome song.
This song brings a lot of emotions to survivors of domestic violence. It's hard to hear without shedding a tear. I've never been a victim BUT have worked with DV survivors for many years and while I do not condone murder, I do know the anger, and near hatred one would feel toward someone physically assaulting a woman for no good reason other than the need to hurt someone. There is a place in hell for people like that and I just choose to let God take care of that and will leave it at that.
I get the point of the song, I do, but especially with all the killing and shootings going on in our country nowadays, I strongly disagree with this song being praised so much.  It's no better than listening to karaoke in my opinion and the violent vigilantism should not to be praised.
I met you I love your songs
I'm a Hard Rock Guy, but this is the best song from 2023......CD arriving tomorrow from Amazon...
iT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THEN THIS.....WE LOVE YOU LAINEY AND HARDY...NOW THOSE ARE LYRICS....SOMETIMES WRONG IS RIGHT ❤
He is sexy as $&@“
track hits like mcbride’s independence day
This isn't murder, it's a justified killing
Wish he could stay on pitch, his voice is hard to listen to
Best song in a couple decades.  Now this is how you write and perform country!  Amazing!❤
Now that’s how you write a country song 👌🏼
Im a north Korean male and this hits me some kinda way
Man Lainey has become a little chunker. lol
Love this song
I'm not a country fan but I have to admit this is a pretty damn good song
I’m a grandma and I love this song. Great lyrics…. Thank you. Wonderful song, always your fan
Ladies who are reading this or know someone whom might be please seek help, there are people out there who really care about your well being!!  Have the Backbone to stand up to Abuse!!

Many years back I Met a woman who ex was abusive and now she is my wife but finding the right person who will listen is A + they are out there!! Make the call to a loved one !

Amazing song amazing voices.just Wow❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
THOUHGT HE WAS IN JAIL
Amazing song.  Amazing performance.  This song gets me every time I listen to it.
Worst country music song in ecades
Excellent,  just Excellent
Don't like country. Love this song.
Damn......that was..just...Great.!!❤
A song of vigilante justice. Maybe she was nuts!!
Thank you there is hope for country music
Holy shit balls the last vocal bust of his has me hitting repeat damn
God damn look and the legs on her!! 🤤🤤
Omg absolutely love ❤these two singing together they deserve all the awards they can get my girlfriend is a survivor of abuse and we listened to this song done nothing but cry together it's so true of a story congratulations Hardy thank you for making such amazing song.
This is a perfect way to gauge the people you surround yourself with.  If a person is not moved listening to this song kick them to the curb. Not only does this song  address the horror of violence against woman but it addresses what a real man should do when he see a woman in this situation. It doesn’t mean you have to kill someone, although a sure way they’ll never do it again, but it’s an example to men that they should do the right thing.  So many men in this country and around the world have turned in to pussies and cowards. Stand up for what is right!
Love this song
You guys did amazing
Love this song so much!
A REAL MAN
I love this song so much and I’m a big fan of this song and I’m really glad
the audience missed the mark when Lainey gets out the truck, where are the cheers and screams! ❤
Wilson has the best booty in country music
That is a awesome song...storytelling is the way to go...Wilson is drop dead gorgeous...dam!
You know it's a good song when everytime you listen to it you get chills. 👍
As a father of 2 beautiful daughters, I wouldn't get any MERCY for those that hurt my daughter's cause I WONT SHOW MERCY when dealin out the cards
Is he married
Dam.
Love this song
Love Hardy ❤
Now I want to see Lainey and Chris Stapleton do one together
This song has me sobbing like child 😢😢😢
HOLY LORD!!!
I was caught up in my truck the first time I heard it, it immediately shook me & grabbed my attention and I just had to know the name of that song growing up in that type of environment ‼️
THAT TRUCK THO!!! ❤❤❤
The whole song gives me chills but the end with Lainey singing have mercy on me hits soo much! She’s got an amazing voice!!
Original country is Back❤
Amen
Driving down Stadium Road in Port Arthur, Texas.  This song came on, I pulled my car over and parked and listened to it. 'Never did this before in my life. 'Outstanding song writing!
i got turnd i never be to befor i love it keep up the good work . nise job love . good job laney wilson
This Is One Great Song  I Like The Words In This There Sound Good Singing Together
If this song hasn't broken #1 around the country charts I dont know what will
Honestly though…..there are thousands of guys who can sing SO MUCH BETTER than Hardy, but that’s just how the business goes. I think he’s great and I LOVE his song writing skills!!
Not a fan of the song, but after he killed the guy (if he was even guilty) why wouldn't they come up with a story of self-defense? It would have been very believable. Instead he's in prison for life gettin corn-holed, but hey, she still visits every couple years...
If it sounds like garbage, it must be garbage. Country music stopped in the 90's.
Amazing song writing here!! Please come to Seattle!
Megan Danielle and Lainey Wilson will make a good duet
Use code: WAITNTRK for tier 1 admission to NRA convention with concierge erry day access to conceal carry popcorn during minions of my notable bigly speakers
Never gets old ❤
THIS!
I absolutely love this song, and  one beautiful Chevy truck!!!!!!
I think we all know why Hardy stood where he stood during this performance 🍑
I am a 51 year old Black man who grew up listening mostly to R&B and hip hop....and I absolutely LOVE this song. Everything about it is literally perfect. Thank you to EVERYONE who was involved in bringing this masterpiece to life.
Need more "judges" under the seat.... At least those judges aren't corrupt.
Story telling country songs! Damn they rock!❤❤❤
Read somewhere that someone called this the best country song in the last 10 years.  I won’t argue against that.  This, and Tim McGraws humble and kind, are def the two best.
And the way she would swallow and look in-between her singing and him it seems like she experienced some kind of abusive relationship like this bit of course nobody was shot
If country songs was more like this then I'd listen to it only country song I like a d ever liked except for a few of old school ones that tell a good story. And when I was a little kid my dad had that exact same truck year color and all and lots of memories in that truck going to town from the middle of nowhere dirt road 50 acres of land we lived on and he was shipped out a lot to war and to Columbia to help take down Pablo Escobar and other countries to help them with problems that u oted states loved to get involved in back in 90-2001 then he went to Iraq/Afghanistan and retired after 25 years of service
That was awesome you guys ❤.
Thats 90s country. Tell a story. Not how you got a slut home
love this song...
Garbage
Too bad too many idiots are the ones leaving whiskey scars … they all need bullets. Def love the story this told like Tracy Lawrence and Garth Brooks. Love her voice specifically and the blend is amazing. It gives you goosebumps hearing it.
Taurus Judge under the seat... Exactly what that means.😅
Omg I love that song ❤
This would not happen in real life. I, as a survivor, had not person other than my Son stand up to his Dad for the abuse. Even though Officers of the law told me they had always known how bad I had been treated. Not one man ever said one word to my husband. Sad
I'm still beading have. I wasn't brought up like that...🤔
That. Was. Beautiful. Magical.  Brilliant.   You. Both. Hit. Every. Note. And. Look. Sexy. As. He'll.  Much. Love.  Thank. You.  Your. Work. Together. Is. Pure. Brilliance. And. Blessings
Lainey got cakes. That's why he stopped lol
I heard on the weekly Lon Helton Show, with Hardy, that this perfomance almost didn't happen. Hardy got married a week before the Show. They postponed their honeymoon so that he could attend the awards show.
That is how it's done boy's!
one of my Faves by a Country Mile 🤠
What a beatiful classic C10 Chevrolet taking in the music
Damn good song...yes this is what country is all about...real life..
I wish I had a hero like this 😢
It's a shame they couldn't hire a choir for the vamp at the end or ask some of the musicians who where there anyway. Imo the effect of it wasn't the same and it had not the same power in it.
These are the best lyrics I have heard in years 👍
The truck they waited in was a dump truck it turns out
So many of us related to this song
So good 😭😭😭😭🙏🏼
I lived it. God bless y'all
This is how it is done. The best performance I have ever seen
I think that this should be number 1 on the country top 40 this song is very true for some women. This song is the best one yegt and I love this one I keep playing it over and over again.
At night CMT with me watching Reba usually fall asleep, just wake to videos glad I did. This song hooked me. I need to catch up with Hardy and Lainey. I’m glad they did this Lainey love the vocals
Great country is back don’t stop you guys are great ❤
Cakes
Cameraman knew what he was doing with that low-side pan across Lainey Wilson's *ahem* backside
I thought it was a song about this https://youtube.com/shorts/BvbkH19d8Ls?feature=share
I love this song. Good storyline.  I love lainey voice.  So  beautiful...
Real Men still exist....and real women still appreciate them! I love this song!!!!!!!
this song hits so hard. know women who been there, and men that either went there or close to it to stop the abuser.
The lyrics, the twist of writing takes me back during Alan Jackson or George Strait (and others) days.
Awesome song ❤
Love this 🎵
I thought it was Reba when I first heard her sing
THIS is a glimpse of what CLASSIC country truly is!! Unique songs that tell a story! Country music today is all cookie cutter industry sounding. This style of song reminds me of Tyler Farr’s Redneck Crazy 👍👍👍👍👍
Dynamite song! Always gives goosebumps & tears in my eyes. 💜
Unfortunately to many of us wished that this would have happened for us!!! WOW HARDY!!! TY SIR FOR THIS SONG!!!
💜💙. It was OIDV.                                                            OFFICER INVOLVED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. 👮🏾‍♂️👮🏾💪🏾🙏🏼🌈👨🏽‍🏭🧑🏻‍🏭💙💙💙💙💙💜🤍
To any man out there that is hellbent on harming women to the point of near death just know that us good old boys will always be the bringers of justice to rid the world of scum like all of you
Killer song
I love this song
I've never identified as a country fan but this song is amazing & powerful ❤️🎸
i love you
👏👏👏
Many people don't realize how hard it is to get out of a situation where there's domestic violence. Especially if you have a child. Often there's no money, nobody and no where to go. They watch every move you make while you watch every word you say. People will tell you to get a restraining order, not realizing that sometimes a restraining order is just a piece of paper that can possibly get you killed. It took me two years of planning, waiting and watching for the opportunity, but I got myself and my child out. That was 20 years ago. He only found us once. I won't go into what was said and done then. I will say we've never seen nor heard from him again. I pray for the people who are in that situation today. Don't lose hope. There is a way out. You may not see it yet, but you will. Don't stop looking until you find it. God Bless.
No BS lip syncing here. Just pure talent! Both are going to be performing at CCMF in Myrtle Beach in June and if they do this there it will be crazy!
First time iv actually understood this song... 😮 wow it's incredible
Most refreshingly Manley song I’ve EVER heard! 🔥
Wow...  Their Voices Together are Outta This World...... Wow...
Butt implants like Kim Kardashian
Can we all just pause to say....HOLY. SHIT. 💖🙏
The dichotomy of this year's CMA Awards, drag queens and a beautiful song glamorizing gun violence to solve an issue. I guess the hypocrisy has no bounds.
Good song...I'm obsessed 😂
Laney is hitting that Tanya Tucker vibe here. DAYUM!!!
Telling you RIGHT NOW….. if I’m on a jury that was presented a case like this, the protector is going free…..   Sick of these stalkers and abusers being treated like their human rights supersede the rights of their victims 😡
Lainey is freaking gorgeous!
This is country. All the .. what ever music at the CMT was  ....
I thank God he left me ~ I was not strong enough to run away! A decade later, I am still healing.
Hell of a song
Gives me chills , yes !!!! This is country music coming back fast
Just love this song.From Finland😀.Those pants  she is wearing 👀 hot hot🤘
Awesome video and song!  Love these two!,
True Country Music is dead, CMT has proven that beyond all doubts...
i love you giss
I like your song, no disrespect to you. It's hard to believe that CMA would allow you to do a legit live performance. CMA management is fake as they come and wants artists to lip sync, and go through the motions. CMA management is so fake, youd think CMA takes orders from the govt, maybe the democratic party, or CNN.
Damn,!!!!! Incredible Luv it 💖💖
1//2 my life living it,  I can so relate  My wounds were invisable.  Wish a nice e fella with a piece would of picked me up.
That’s a great performance, but she filling up those pants sooooo nice!!! Whew!!! Dammmm
She’s so sassy I love it so much, and this is amazing songwriting, this has got to be the best new country song in a very long time
I got chills...
20 + years later…. I just wish my EX would come clean and admit what he did. I’m so sick and tired of hiding those whiskey scars and emotional & physical scars that still mess with me to this day 😢
What a morbid song! Still another country tune glorifying the killing of a horrible man. "Goodbye Earl" was enough of this sort of thing. Please---NO MORE!
Probably one of the best country songs I've ever heard. You don't put your hands on lady like that.
can we just talk abt laineys energy during this
How the heck do they perform This without crying? I cant even listen to it without crying my eyeballs out 😢 this song is in my all time favorite top 3
This is 2 galaxies colliding, absolutely amazing!
I'm 46 ... believe it or not there used to be songs like this ....telling story's
Love this song. Been there. Done that.
Chills every time. Superb in every way.
I watched it over and over and over. Now I'll watch it again. I love music with a story and meaning. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This song kicks-ass!  I have it in my head all the time!! Rock n Roll 🎶👍
Laney is too damn beautiful
I have a question  is this a true story
She could sing her hind end off but that would break my heart 😉.  Seriously, she's a star.
Lainey is one of the most beautiful women in the world;)
FAt kid rock
glad you flashed your Molloch symbol.     you are evil
His voice is weak and thin also…
The simp anthem!
Wow! Resonates within me in ways too many will understand!  Powerful tune!
laieny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! omg
1:00 I don't know who they hell you think you are lady, the song title is wait in the truck not come out of the truck and start singing.
At 3.55 look at her eyes 👀 om goodness
Self-parody. Fuck me, country music used to be cool.
Anyone notice how Hardy looks like Otto from Sons of Anarchy especially in the video?  Excellent performance by 2 great artist.. Love it! More please and Thanks for keepin it real..
Man that's good. Better than the original video.
Lainey is this generations Reba.  Edit: Hardy is my favorite artist/writer/storytellers ever. Love hearing a Mississippi man
Just wait in the uber...
Lmao, watch how wide her eyes get when she sings.
calm down lainey
Waylon swag like duet
Love it!!!!Old time story telling by a MAN!!!!!!!!!
Nice Chevy Truck
If he is singing in an arena, he must have had his sentence expedited?
Man she IS country.
Hot damn
Great song. Real story. One of the best. Hard to find.
Totally  Bad Azz !!!
That song represents everything we should be doing as decent human beings. It’s strange when you get jailed as a normal person for doing good but the law can do the same thing and no questions asked. Great song and video on you tube
They really have the feeling behind these lyrics. Awesome song sad however women do put up With the behavior of the man in the video. Emotional And physical abuse is Not a man. A man is that “angel”thanks For this song and the message. I feels it helps people.
"I never thought my day of justice would come from a judge under his seat" just wow.
I don't care what y'all say, Hardy is the top GOAT songwriter of all time.  In any genre.
This gives me chills
Great song. GREAT PERFORMERS!!!!
My goodness. County music with vigilante justice story tellin. Nothing better!!!! As we as a society move towards defund police, this story gets better and better!!
Story telling right there!! Love it! Vigilante justice !!
One critique - did he just blindly believe she was telling the truth about whose house he was going to or what happened? 😮
Oh he is on some Slim Shady stuff, country edition.
I from the UK and relatively new to the Country music scene.   I saw Lainey Wilson at Country 2 County at the 02 in London this month (March 2023).  She was one of the supporting acts to Thomas Rhett.   I hadn't heard of her before because I only dabbled in Country music.  I'll be honest, she blew me away.  Her fiery passion and utter belief in herself is what attracted me to her.  She totally knew how to grasp her audience.   I've been home for a week since the 3 day festival and have spent most of it listening to her.
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS SONG!!!!🫶💜🔥
She's got a Dolly and Miranda Lambert mix voice! Absolutely love these two! This song is the greatest song written in the past 50 yrs!!
👍
It has been my experience with men, that there are more men who protect women's honor than not. I am an older woman and I love men because of their nature to protect and provide for the innocent. There are more men that are faithful to the promises they make to females on this earth than scoundrels that do not. Wait till you are older to determine the difference between good behavior men and bad behavior men. Thirty years is a better age to begin dating anyone. 🇺🇲⚘️
Good made music,,, but it ant quite the country I grew up on... it just seems to me, that it Emphasizes on just using a gun....and there i think it misses the point of the song...cause it wouldn't need a gun to do what a man had to do. Don't get me wrong I love my guns... I wouldn't need a gun,, I  thinks its more personal that way.
Amazing - You should be no1!! Love it thank you! Now I have to hear it again!!
Nashville must have employed new producers who recorded the likes of Tom T. Hall; Randy Travis!
Amen
I absolutely love this song thank you ❤❤❤
I love this song I think it was better here then recorded . Lainey is so gorgeous I need a gal like her in my life
👩‍🚒👮🏻‍♂️ still doing it
Hi Laniey 😘😘😘😘🙏💍🙏💪🤙
Between her voice, her beauty, and that body that woman will go down in history. Amazing! Laney have mercy 😅.
Well the dang thang is in D-flat so that's a kick in the guts cos it's ... How's a good ol' boy gonna play in D-flat sweet mama child? Maybe these country folk been smoking too much hay?
Awesome love it.
Damn her ass rocks
Wait in the truck....Southern code for something is about to happen you don't need to see.
this is what a man does..........sick of being told to back  down...we all are.  Woke culture can go to hell.
This song reminds me of a few of my x girlfriends,always protected them to til death or prison..
Hardy /Eric church/what a show that would be
Righteous....
Just WOW👏❤️👏
This song is a response to what has been happening for the last 20 years....this is what a man does. For thousands of years. We have been told to wait for the police, government, and been suppressed... this song says on a deep level what we honorable men have known and done for centuries...  take out the trash. End evil.  I would rather be judged by 12 then be carried by 6!  This is a reaction to this woke crap.... God Bless.....
Incredible songwriter, singer, and storyteller! Love Hardy and Lainey
Domestic violence needs attention like this
YEA ANGEL DO!!!
real country? hell yeah im listening.
Her voice is too strong for his
I can't tell you how real this song is. First time hearing it, but even at my advanced age it brought tears to my eyes. This takes me back to what I call the good days. Songs that come from everyday life and people. Haggard or Jones or Tweety would be proud of this one for sure!!❤
I got turned around in some little town I'd never been to before Working my way through a middle-of-June Midnight thunderstorm  There was something in the headlights It stopped me on a dime Well, she was scared to death, so I said "Climb in, " and then she climbed Oh, yeah  Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe With a tear in her blood-stained shirt She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to I knew what had happened to her  I didn't load her down with questions That girl had been through enough I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes And I asked her where he was  I don't know if he's an angel 'Cause angels don't do what he did He was hellbent to find the man behind All the whiskey scars I hid  I never thought my day of justice Would come from a judge under a seat But I knew right then I'd never get hit again When he said to me  "Wait in the truck Just wait in the truck"  Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came So I kicked in his double-wide door I let the hammer drop before he got To that 12 he was reaching for  I didn't try to hide my pistol I didn't even try to run I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes And waited for the cops to come  I don't know if he's an angel 'Cause angels don't do what he did He was hellbent to find the man behind All the whiskey scars I hid  I never thought my day of justice Would come from a judge under a seat But I knew right then I'd never get hit again When he said to me  "Wait in the truck Just wait in the truck" Whoa (whoa) Have mercy on me, Lord Have mercy on me Have mercy on me (hey), Lord  It's been 60 months and she still comes To see me from time to time It was worth the price, to see a brighter side Of the girl I picked up that night  And I might be here forever It ain't paradise, that's true But it's whole hell of a lot better Than the place I sent him to, yeah  Wait in the truck (have mercy on me) Just wait in the truck (Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) Wait in the truck (Lord, have mercy) Just wait in the truck  have mercy on me, Lord Have mercy on me (Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) have mercy on me, Lord Have mercy on me
I've said it before, this is a powerful song, especially when Lainey steps in! It's pulling on my emotions like no song has ever done. Those two are the best talents I've heard in a long time!
love his range
Why doesn't he play an instrument?
That. Was. Fantastic.
Convinced hardy is zach bagans🤣
realy nice ! :)
30secs in and way better than his wwe performance haha
I wish I had a Angel like this.
Her voice is country and beautiful
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🫶🏼🫶🏼👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
❤

wow
There’s something in her voice 🤙💪🙏💍🙏 voice of an Angel 😘😘😘
Found Lainey again 😘😘😘 your voice tho 🤤🤤🤤
He got released from prison already? Yay🎉
As someone who as hated modern country for my whole life, it's a pretty amazing thing for me to actually like a country song.
This is absolutely incredible. Hands down the best song to come out in the past 2 years
That is one helluva song, very well done.
I'm sucha Lainey fan!!!! 😉
EVERYTIME I hear this song, I get goosebumps! And to hear it LIVE! With all that emotion, well it tugs at your heart! 👏 OUTSTANDING performance BOTH of you! And thank you for writing such a touching song! Much luv&Support from East Tennessee 🧡💋 Ps.. I can NOT get this song outta my head! I catch myself singing different parts of the song all thru out the day! Idk how many times I've came back to rewatch, but it gets me everytime. 🫶💞
Hardy doing us Mississippi folks proud! What an amazing song writer!
I'm late to the party! What song writing skills and delivery!
The Zak Baggins of country music
Powerful and moving performance. Lyrically superb. #DomesticViolenceAwareness💜🦋💜🦋
Ghetto hillbilly song
She's so beautiful

WOW I LOVE UR SONGS!!!!!
Finally, a country song that sounds like a country song!
So.. who do she have waiting in that trunk?
What type of truck is this?
Oh. Hardy was there with her. I didn’t notice.
Awesome video 👏
Lainey got that cake.....
Damn right
She's amazing.... Hardy sounds like someone doing karaoke.
Amazing!! I love this song so sis much!! I can’t even explain my love for this ❤️
If that ain't Country I'll kiss your ass.
Laniey gets a lot too into it.
Best video of all time
Lainey's flair pants sucha vibe 🔥
This better win performance of the year
I know this is under the label of Country but this song is to great to be boxed.  It's good to hear songs again that actually tell a great story that draws you in. His lyrics paint the picture as well as the official video does.
This song hits hard! It brings back memories of what I went through
Powerful song....powerful artists....AWESOME
I like the music and all but damn she fine!!!!!!
Real country we need more of this!!
I know he mentions about smoking one of the dude's cigarettes, but I could almost picture puttin' in a dip while driving and getting ready to let the hammer drop.
Thank you I'm grateful to see country getting back to being country 😀 keep up the good work
I just came to see that Wagon she is toting back there once more.
This song converted me into a country boy
Legit one of the best songs written along with Chris Stapleton's Fire Away. Wow!
That's text book panderin
I love the song partner but can you really back that up, or is it just a song about men that have
Superstars in the making!!
When she's sings "have mercy" so strong.
My ex-wife was a country music fan.  I would love to see L.W. Live with her.  Great Song!
I'm going to say wait in the corolla because I love Mpg!
Tim Honeycutt
This is story telling country which can't be beat. They're both FANTASTIC performers.
Well written beautiful song, nailed it.
Hardy is a song writing machine. He just keeps writing and singing hits.
Really Surprised CMA let them sing this song with all the pantywaist liberals in Nashville now
I’m in love with her! This song here has to be the best song country music has released in about 10 years
You sir are a lyrical genius!!! Complete banger and Lainey is a perfect partner!!!! Also where I’m from guys who do that we have a little thing called a blanket party !!
To be able to have these 2 voices coming up in music makes my heart sooooo happy!!! I’m only 27 but my soul is old and I have memories I shouldn’t have I swear. They bring tears to my eyes… gives me goosies!! Lol idk how to explain it. They have the vocals of the dearly musical loved ones that won’t be here much longer.. I guess that’s the best way to say it… 😢🫤🥹 if you know you know I guess lol if not… I’m sorry for your loss of musical experience and to start taking notes youngsters lol
Thank you. My ex beat me and nobody knew. He has passed since then and he has met his maker. I am good now.
#Upchurch #CreekSquad #RHEC
Hardy should be entertainer of the year
I love this song ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love this song been there
Boy she’s a real *asset* huh 💀
No!!!!!!! Literally just now saw you were performing at the WV State fair Aug 13 and tickets are sold out already =(  Would have loved to come see you in my home state!
Love this song her voice is so classic country music.  Reminds me of Reba and dolly mixed
Omg 😲 what a beautiful song, lyrics got me in ❤️ . I'm from Poland 🇵🇱 and normal I don't listen country music, but this is gereed 😍👌
I'm a Domestic Violence Survivor and this song hits home. Awesome Collaboration
I listen to this over and over…so good.
I love seeing all these young artists bringing the people they appreciate with them
love it😍❤❤❤
Just INCREDIBLE,,💕
This song is 🔥
It doesn’t get any better than this, the song, performance, and lyrics give me chills. Mad respect for the both of them and Hardy can write a song that’s for sure. Only time I get chills is when I hear a good song/performance and this was one of them.
she must be related to someone with influence and or money as she is terrible.
Hardy is such a damn good song writer dude
Love this song! Great job!
Judge sales when this dropped.↗↗↗↗💲💲
Lainey Wilson is country music's J-Lo and she looks terrific and sings great! Writes her own songs, too, doesn't she?
Wow! Never thought I'd see country music address domestic violence in this way. Geez-Lueez... what a duet!
FREAKING PHENOMENAL!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤️
Wait. Do performers at CMA's all sing live or is this an exception? That was full-on awesome. Love to see the story songs of my youth making a comeback. Don't you know Marty is sitting on a cloud up there, harmonizing?
Hardy is a big boy ❤️
That a$$... Platinum
A beautiful women in a sexy truck. Life doesn't get any better
midnight  u didn't tell the truth  ur hell u came in the but I never for get what u say  girl it not how  mercy on me
Love this song @HARDY
Why is she holding up the devil horns , in the pic????????
She has such a powerful voice....sounds very much like Reba McEntire
I bet when you performed the song that night you wasn't thinking at all that it was going to be a number one hit. . Well I got news for ya. If it don't hit number one I'll be surprised but this song is going to ride in the charts for a very long time. Congratulations on your big hit brother.
Thicc
So beautiful
Those cheeks
Lainey Wilson sounds 🔥 live!
i was really expecting hardy to blast a cap when he sang the part abt shooting the guy
not only write #1 songs, hardy can sing his ass off. hardy== true Nashville talent
😂 dude looks like Zak from ghost adventures
Morgan wade is like 1000 times better then this Nashville crap!!!
Country music sure isn’t what it used to be. The lyrics are just ok at best. And that’s all the good I have to say about it. The way they look is real bad. The performance was boring and his voice is terrible. Def auto tuned on the record. Her voice is fine but her outfit is trash!! It’s sad really!! Where this generation is taking country music. Thanks miss underwood!!
Whatta Caboose!!!
Absolutely loved it. Such feeling and a true heart of compassion. What a song hero .A true man ❤️
Now that’s country. What a phenomenon songwriter keeping it real👏👏👏👏👏 you’ll be having me more listening to this country absolute at its best. Congratulations💪💪👏💪👏
OMG best song ever. brings tears to my eyes, reminds me of my mom  . she needed a man like him (the angel)
God!  The way she says "have mercy".
this is so ridiculous. why go to prison for someone you never met and in a town you had never been to? should have been easy to get away with that.  He def needed to die but no prison time should come from it
Lord have mercy 🤙
Holy cow County music have returned. Thank God.  Best on you tube
3:56 to 4:00 gives me goose bumps EVERY TIME! Boy puts his soul in this one! Damn!
Just wait in the truuuck bing bong bing bong just wait in the truuuck bong bing bong bing
He can not sing that well live. Dude really needs a booth to sound good. such a shame.
THANK YOU BOTH FOR THE GREAT SONG AND PERCORMANCE🙏✝️❤
My wife just got home from work and said she heard this on the Radio. We were laughing our ass off when she told me what it was about. Is this what country music has come too? We was ROLLIN!
Out-fucking-Standing!  Great performance, great performers and a great story! Thank you!!
Goddam she thicker then a snicker 🤤
You sounded like shit live when you perform on wwe a month ago. Sound better here.
This is your third cup of coffee
What a great live performance and a really good collaboration. Their voices mesh really well together.
From a 24 year survivor of domestic violence this song hit home my now husband came from Montana during one of the court cases I had against the ex my husband has been paralyzed since age 16 and he wheeled into court with me and my children he wore his mountain man hat with the bear claws and never said a word just looked at the ex one time the ex turned away and was terrified I told my husband he is scared it was a shock to me the ex took off right after to California where he died alone and I am living happily ever after with my husband in the mountains of Montana where I feel safe and loved if you see someone getting hurt do the right thing and stand up for them
Cool truck
Imagine if the did a rap song with broken blinds, where houses actually look like that. These artists are fake country.
The best song that's ever been made I love it
This performance gave me goosebumps when she was getting out of that truck
That’s was so good! They’re so good together.
Great duet
You know it’s good when it makes you feel something!!!💕
One of my favorites and I hope a Angel like that can run up on me one day!
damn okay BAWDYYYY
No Angel.  Just a Dummy. .  She was beaten and bleeding.  You saved her.  Now she saves you , takes the wrap and claims SELF DEFENSE.  So stupid
when someone asks me "Do you like Country" it's tough because I don't care for "bro country" and don't like songs about your truck, your girl's cutoffs or your party plans. THIS I love
Hardy had the best view 😮
Great song
This is my favorite song it hit place of home my first son's father came and saved me from someone like that in the video and he said about the same thing to me but that's not why he is still in prison for 38yr,s his family did,nt want us to get married so they put a. False story on him and he,s still setting in there and never got to see his son born at all or meet him. Still until this day I send him a letter and thank him for saving me all those times and that I miss him alot . That's why this song is my favorite 1 for now . 🙃🙃😜😀😀💕💕❤️❤️
As a mom of a dv survivor…I cried. 😢
I gathered a council of the best linguists and philologists from the 4 Galaxies, and we could not find words to say how good this song is.
Like and comment here if you like hardy
These two just saved country music in one shot ! Love it hope to see more of them !!!!
Of course hardy would show off his truck at a live show
Damn they are amazing live!  Every time I hear this song it gives me goosebumps!!  Best song I've heard in a long time!  Definitely needs more playtime on radio!
Wow💪🏽😩
Piece of Art 👍
Sounds like my story of my childhood.  Want to thank the angel sent from God who served justice to my psychopathological rapist and torture birthfather. FBI never even tried to find out who did it.
She gets in the truck and knows a dude for 5 minutes before he decides he’s going to murder her boyfriend. Sounds like a dateline story.
Love this song!
I'm just here for Lainey's booty.
I got a butt like a truck ❤
The new Garth Brooks, believe me.
Powerful. Made me well up
Wow incredible performance!
wow I love to see y'all live
Thank you.  From a billion different women, and daughters. Thank you.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Her outfit is hideous
lol
Awesome song! Lainey Wilson and hardy are awesome!
Good lord this is awful. I want my real country music back.
Cute song.... ridiculous concept! In real life....the man should keep the doors locked and keep those crazy hoes in the rear view mirror! 💯👍
LOVE LOVE ME SOME COUNTRY 🤠🤠🤠 THEY KILLED IT💞💞🙏🏾
@HARDY this song is very personal to me. My mom was abused by my stepdad and you don’t know how many nights I laid in bed thinking about doing this to him.
Kons😮
Love the song! Country strong
This has be the Song of the Year .  Powerful!
She's the only artist that could perform with her back to the crowd and probably still sell out the venue 🤣
They sang the HELL! out of that song.... Definitely the single of the year ...
Such an epic song for such an important issue of spousal abuse. And Lainey Wilson 😍😍😍
Hardy.... bruh You are the future of country music
Taurus Judge !!
Wow...stellar performance of a genuine country song.  This storytelling that's going on in this country song, for real, grabbed me and commanded my attention.  It was true perfection, and I was wrapped up tight in the drama.  Honestly, I didn't want it to end.  I hope to see a lot more modern yet traditional masterpieces by these 2 might fine performers.
This is complete garbage.  Nashville needs nuked
Best line ever… “I might be here forever, it ain’t paradise that’s true, but it’s a whole lot better than the place I sent him to”
Love you both hell of song wow
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the modern day Joleen ❤
The story is about half believable if so half men b n prison other half dead
I relate to this song 😌
I got turned around in some little town
Good lord that booooty why didn’t the lord bless me like this 😂❤
Good stuff
EXCELLENT, OUTSTANDING SONG AND PERFORMANCE!!
I’ll wait in that dump truck
Lainey....the voice of a country angel!!
Lainey Wilson Always Steals the Show!!
So cool 😎
Holy damn. This is the country music we need.
Great Song writing . When I seen this performance and heard this for the first time , I really felt it . Thank You
now this is country😊
Love her passion!!!!
🍻
So he finds an abused woman on the road. She gets in the truck. Instead of going to the hospital to get medical and legal help, they go back to the scene of the crime to unload some egotistical testosterone vengeance. Promotion of Premeditated murder.  Thats sickening and a twisted song. No wonder people are so twisted today.
Real stuff
She's awsome, the song is great but he sucks
Luved this song until I saw LW's theatrics in this performance - thought she acted like she was going to start fighting Hardy there at the end.  Wish she could just sing without all the side head bobbing & theatrics - makes it too corn ball for me js.
Dump truck
Amazing.
The track is good but the lyrics are a little weird
Best song ever!!!
😮
This is such a terrible song for little boys.  As men you have to realize there is so many way outs for women that aren't there for men. Don't throw your life away for a woman that feels the need to fix broken men.
I like this song. It's  sad that there are people out there like that guy reaching for the 12
Dumbest song ever, makes no sense!!!!!
I will die trying to save a child or woman
Your soul matches mine
I'm sweating on fire
this is what country music needs to be and what we need it to be.
Lainey's booty 👀👀👀🥰
Lainey your voice is very soul taken
Powerful song
Loved this song!  You two sing SO well together as well.
Hope u are right Debbie, been writing story songs forever and this is a great song and the direction I hope country music is headed.
All I know is she is smoking hot
Hardy is one of the most amazing writers and performers I’ve heard in a long time. Their voices are just awe inspiring together with a song that gives you chills.
That Ass!
I have to hear this song every day
good god o mighty im about to go wait in the truck and look out the window with a smile
Is it just me or does Lainey Wilson have the best voice in country.She is simply amazing
Love this song!  I just wish someone was there for me, when I was being raped and hurt all my  years of it! This song is so good it brings tears into my eyes! God Bless you both!!
Good lord! I NEVER listen to live videos but this is a whole new level of awesome!  THIS version is literal music to my ears!  ❤ love love love!!! Cannot wait to hear you two do another song together 🤤😍
Country music is in good shape as long as these 2 are singing it this song is strong and tender at the same time great song
I love you guys I didn’t realize that. Was you listen to it all the time❤
All Women beaters need to take note that your days are numbered, I love this song by Hardy&Lainey the perfect pair for it.🤙🇺🇸🇺🇸🤙
THIS.  ... ... .. I love and listen to all kinds of music... it more than sustains... it justifies.  Makes life worth the toll you pay.  I roll with TLC and Smokey and  P!nk and R&B when i cook.  Bouncy sh!t.   I clean violently to Lemmy's Motorhead and Dave's Foo and Rammstein and Metallica's Whiskey in a Jar... I listen to classical when I need to seriously focus on spreadsheets and a half million gone wrong if i sneeze sideways..  and country/folk/dirt of the earth is my centering.  This is a song on my Staylist... above playlist and the random YT bot roll arounds... It's a fav for all the right and all the wrong reasons.
Why is she over acting it so much?
What a great song, great lyrics and a great performance!. Amazing story telling ability to turn that into a few minutes.
the story telling is incredible
Best song that I have heard in a long time
Bsldli😊😊
If this doesn’t win EVERY AWARD FOR EVERY THING ILL BE SAD ,, when you have to whip tears 3 times from your eyes ,  extremely this best EVER
Support and report injustice. and be an advocate for those that can not
Shit ass music. These new artists singing this shit music isnt country music and hasnt been for a long time. Its sad. I miss real country music. Johnny cash, merle haggard, george jones, daryl singletary, keith Whitley. There is only a handful of artists left alive thats real country music. After there gone country music will be gone as far as Im concerned. Just glad I have there CD's
Garbage
Wow badass country music !!! 🍻
Never knew Zak Bagans could sing like that
"Have mercy on me" is exactly what every guy here is thinking every time Lainey turns her back to the camera 😁😁
Finally a voice to be heard
I'd do the same🙏
i dont have a judge under the seat but i do have an executioner
She got to have a lil afro in her or it's been in her
This sounds exactly like the recorded version. THAT is talent!!
Who is the guy
Wow 2 super stars of country is gonna be bright
When hardy sang “waited for the cops to come..yea I did” got me! ❤
She brought back bell-bottoms and I gotta say I love it. I'm sure most men wanna just admire how she looks but I admire her voice this song makes sense to wllot of weman who have dealt with something that their talking about the whiskey scars
mmmmm country murder muzik.
GATDAMM
Saw her at my small-town fair 3 summers ago. Cool.
Thank God for Hardy. He got me back into country music. We need more of him.
The look in her eyes at 3:17 she knows how it is to hide whiskey scars
I love this song. It speaks to a lot of ladies who have been abu.
My GOD that play on play & the throw down & out in the end!!  Y'all come on now!! Wooh!! Word for word the writing the acting/ feeling the whole dang nine!!  Even how he kicks his feet up in the cell in the video!!  For all of us who didn't get to get our justice from a judge under a seat... thank you for being our hero's.  Yes, besides all that, best written song in decades. <3
Lauren Alaina?  Odd looking eyes, nose, lips, and hips.  She thinks she's a singer.   She's not a singer.   She's nothing but an ugly American idol contestant loser in 2011.  She will never find a collaborator.
Gorgeous, phenomenal, empowering, lovely, outstanding!
Hardy is almost in disguise. Who is that behind all the get up.
What a great song and great story. I love this song so awesome!
Powerful song and performance. Set was fantastic as well. That last note that Hardy hit? Holy f**k. Love these two. Country is back. Indeed. More please. ❤❤
Of course the coward who puts his hands on this woman won’t answer the door when a fair fight comes
This is country, ladies and gentlemen
This is country music ❤❤❤❤❤
Just too good..too good
Enough said
Hail state!! There hardy. What a great song.
Anyone else here because they saw this guy on WWE? I’m a metal fan but I’m glad I checked him out. Not bad at all.
I just want that Chevy C10!
Love, love this song!!  You both are great singers!  Hope you do more songs together!
is that slim shady?
This is an awesome song…Hardy , Morgan Wallen, Ernest are the upcoming country singer songwriters…the closest we have to true country.I’m old school and grew up listening to Johnny cash, Loretta Lynn, Conway twitty etc and true country I hope is coming back at least a little
LW is sooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Judge under a seat has deep meaning which is Taurus judge the gun he had under the seat
Real truck right there not no electric bull$h!t
I love that song..
Lainey, is the real solid voice of country ,dreamy and crisp real COUNTRY ,REAL DEAL....AMEN
❤🎉👩🏼‍🎓🧑🏻‍🎓
Hardy is overrated.  Lainey is annoying in this song and live her hand movements are rediculous
I see a lot of people saying now this is how country is done i totally agree we fell into a country/pop/rock thing for quite a bit of time which I don't consider country come at me all you want for that. I feel a lot of artist like this and even new ones stepped up and were like I got you I'll bring country back. Anybody else think a majority of the music like that country/stuff was older artists trying to stay hip but it didn't land to the people that have been listening to country all their life just the new people that were everything country became a trend
In the meantime, your arrested and convicted on murder and wind-up doing life in prison while the lady, that you did this for, has cashed in the life ins. policy on said dead husband and is enjoying life with a new boyfriend and a new truck...no women on this planet is worth that aggravation...lol
First time hearing this song & the style and lyrics remind me of Jamey Johnson. 👍
goose bumps
Oh man why did she color her hair freaking 😫 blonde 👱‍♂️.. red is the Rock 🤘star!!!
So you kill a guy you never met for a girl you never met? Now you're locked up for life and you didn't even hit. Sounds like you fucked up
Sounds like you got played like a chump buddy
awsome
I relate
I have avenged 2 ladies in my life like this and that motherfucker deserved what I gave him. I would do it again even in my older years. No woman deserves whiskey scars
I hope the Lord has MERCY ON EVERYONE, cause JUDGEMENT IS COMING TO THE WICKED....Woot Woot, all Glory to the King Of Kings
The song is good, the singer reminds me a lot of kid rock's raspy voice. Did Kid Rock tutor Hardy?
I've said it before and will say it again... The main character is an idiot. He made an assumption without a full explanation from her (a complete stranger) by his own admission, or actual evidence of any kind. Which spurred him to kick in the front door and trespass into the home of another complete stranger. Then killing the home owner as he went for his own weapon to defend himself and his home from an armed break in. Never even checking to see what evidence there was to hold or oppose his assumption of the situation. The main character in the story is an absolute idiot thanks to poor story construction leaving massive plot holes eliminating any logic to the actions. I've seen the effects on a friend of mine being arrested for "physically assaulting" his ex which was proven in court to have never happened, and that she had paid two female friends of hers to beat her up so she looked the part and say they had seen him do it. I understand it does happen to some women, but not every woman is actually the victim, and not every man the actual criminal. Evidence and due process are paramount in importance.
Lainey’s body, my goodness
😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  fire them asap
I JUST SUBSCRIBED,HARDY,,❤ YOU ARE BRILLIANT,,HARDY,LAINEY,,,,EQUAL TO GEORGE JONES AND TAMMY WYNETTE,,MORE SONGS TOGETHER BRING EM ON ,,❤❤  ILL JUST WAIT IN THE TRUCK ,❤ ,,,,,,YOU NEED TEE SHIRTS THAT SAY WAIT IN THE TRUCK,,, AND ILL JUST WAIT IN THE TRUCK ,,,❤
I LOVE YOU,,❤. YOU ARE GREAT,,,,, SOUND LIKE STEVE EARL❤ ,,THIS IS A GREAT DUET VOCALS ,PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY TOGETHER
Always loved a good story song
This caught me very emotional, I never heard this song before. My father was very abusive to my mom and I wish I was the man that told the lady to wait in the truck.
Her voice has a little bit of Dolly in it!💞
Song about premeditated murder and women that choose to remain victims of their abusers.
GOD BLESS
Lainey Wilson 😍😍😍
Who is Lauren Alaina?  Why does she always look so u..gly and disgusting?                   @Starbaby=Your daughter Lauren Alaina looks so odd and weird.  Yuck!,,
The only justice does come from a judge under the seat….judges on the bench fail everytime
Was taught at a very young age. If I ever put my hands on a woman & hurt her. I can't call myself a man. That has stuck in my brain for 50 years now. Was it justice what he did for that woman. Oh Hell Ya..
When they tell her to haul ass she has to take two trips😂
Hang up the hat, Lainey. . .You're too attractive to hide your face.
The TWANG sounds phoney....Way too much 'twang' in country these days  : (
I've been there. This song touches me. I cry everytime I hear it. They both have such powerful voices.
Get song with a great story behind it.  And we all love her phat ass too!!!
Laney, just so you know, don't worry about what others think about your figure. Just be yourself.  All you criticizers can pound sand.
Idc what anybody says, she is feeling more comfort in herself with each song she does. Your killing it girl!! Also, best duet ever.
😂❤🙏🏻
How did this not get a grammy nomination?
These two are unreal musicians. I love watching live performances
Lainey is just perfectly perfect.
I really  hope they perform this song at Rockville in Daytona , with her guest appearance
So he’s in prison for life  She’s out doing some new loser  And he wants the Lord to ‘have mercy’.  The song should be ‘I stayed in the truck’
amazing
He should've won that award
Such a great song and better video. I wouldn't do what he did, but I would have made it save for our heroes when they got there to haul that piece of $+&@ away to the can. Hahaha. That would have been an explosive situation and those Men have families.
Love the song
💓👢 Country Music Awesome
Hi Gav and Ryan
Great song..country is back thanks hardy and Lainey...those other country singers in the crowd, this is what we want
Such a good pair! Hardy is a cool dude with a great voice. Lainey is so beautiful with a great voice with some attitude. Best duet ever!
Anyone notice hardy looks like Otto from sons of anarchy
I love this song! I would love to see a movie made from the lyrics of this song. Hardy is a great song writer and could do well as a movie producer.  As for Lainey Wilson, well, i can’t say enough how authentic she is and how I love her true county sound.
Great choice of  the truck to be on the stage
Wait in the truck. Then she gets out.
This is real country music!!!! The music video was also so good. It told a story. I also loved the old body style red and silver Ford truck.
I don't thinknthere is a single soul, that didn't CRY , MYSELF INCLUDED,  that didn't cry the first time they heard it!!! Love Both of them! GOD BLESS YOU BOTH  HARDY & LAINEY
Hardy sounds like crap here….all off pitch. Sounds like he’s trying too hard to get that country twang going. He’s clearly a studio singer. Now, Lainey…..good gawd! That woman sounds as good as she looks.
KidRock.
My wife introduced me to this song. Just one more reason why I love her so much!
You are so 😎

😢oh Wow,I’m c😢rying so Bad, For All ov’e US! That Can Relate Love To ALL
Hardy literally gave me chills this guy is fucking amazing!
Man I'm sorry but that dude cannot sing, and it just seems like they'll sign anybody today. And when are people gonna learn that just because  you put a country accent to any song that it doesn't make it country... You people will get behind anything these days and that's what messing it all up! Good lord!🤦🏼‍♂️
i c a n t  s t o p  w a t c h i n g !!! 🖤🖤🖤
Best song in a long time.
the fact the cops would even arrest someone for this is whats wrong with the world self defense should not be crime
Lainey Wilson is straight up Bad Ass!!! Nuff Said 😉
This is a great song, now I have lived for 67 years not being a big country person, but this past year I have grown to love it, there are so many great artist out there, Hardy is sure one of them..
Well he sucks live lol
She’s the new Shania Twain…. With serious 🎂
This song hits me right in the heart as my sire use to abuse the whole family. Thank you both of you for this song
That’s a pretty badass line when he said prison is better than the place he sent the abuser to
I put this girl in the same league as Reba.
It's a movie in your mind! Great storytelling...unfortunately it happens all too often(the abuse not the vengence)
Lainey Wilson is next level! Can’t get enough of that voice! Would love to work with her some day!
Thank God Country is getting back to its original story-telling style! This is how it’s done!
Coming from a person of domestic abuse, this song and the passion for the song and music in general between you both... Makes an awful situation, almost beautiful.
That belt from Hardy at 3:55 was just purely powerful wow
I'm listening to this on my TV 😂 and phone!! I love this song!
Best Song I believe I've ever heard!  L&R
FINALLY! A REAL COUNTRY SONG!!!! THIS IS HOW YOU TELL A STORY BABY!!! LOVE THIS!!
I absolutely love this song
Now That's What I Call Country Music~~~I LOVE IT  ❤
This story telling  country duo 💙💝is magic 🎶❤️‍🩹🙏🏽
I’ll wait by the truck…the dump truck that is 🤤🤤😏
Such a powerful song.
Now by gosh she'll go toe to toe with ya so when you come in better come in hot this girl can sing
Sorry.. but songs that romanticize domestic violence just feed in to the epidemic victim mentality among this generation of young women, and once again, villianize men.
the best song of the night
Another princess 4 country, girl power yes!!!!
Lainey gives off old country vibes from Dolly and Reba, with a bit of Miley Cyrus   Perfection!!
Probably the best ever well I know it is
Best song ever. I love this song. 💜💜💜 it makes me feel seen, understood & loved. Thank you! 🙏🏼♥️🤍🛻💓
Why was this in a playlist for college football games???
I’m the Mama Bear. My girl knows it’s going down when i say just sit here. Don’t move. ❤😢
I just cannot give this performance enough praise. Outstanding
yeah right, okay bud
It’s too bad so many just turn their heads away… 😢😢
This song gives me goosebumps.😢 been there, done that; wearing the scars like a proud woman. I was told “I wouldn’t keep hitting you if you’d just stay down the first time.” Really? Well, that makes me fight even harder. Half McCoy, half Ingram. We don’t know the word “quit”. ❤

Lainey Wilson attacks a vocal like a franchise athlete takes over a game when everything is on the line.
Great collaboration of voices!  I think she needs better fashion stylist. She's beautiful, but those pants do not flatter her.
All women be careful about out there!!!!!!!!
Unbelievable performance 💥

Love the song
I LOVE the fact that the audience cheers when Hardy says he sent him to hell. No real man lays his hands on a woman.
She is straight 🔥 🔥 🔥
Lainey dragging a wagon
Holy hell they are powerhouses together. Goosebumps.
That judge under  the seat was a 410 judge
Just a song
Hell yes
Sexiest lady alive
Now that's a country song!
I. Love this song and this song is also my favorite song and my Wife favorite song to and I always to  it when I play forntie on my ps4
Now that I am turning gay.      Just kidding
He is ok to
Sexiest lady on earth
I just love your music you're so good and very very beautiful cowgirl
Hi laniey
The song is powerful, but no man is going to kill another man for a girl that he don't know, and if he does, that would be wrong.
Lainey Wilson is a total package. Amazing voice and looks that could kill.
That voice, those curves…she’s omg.. and I’m from Delco…
she is trying too hard, .... way too hard!
The main lesson every child needs to learn about dating and marriage is this: pick Abel, not Cain. Get that right and you'll never be the girl in this song's story. But there is another lesson: BE Abel, not Cain. Both men in the story fail at this. There's a reason the song's story has the hero spending the rest of his life in prison. There's nothing the current law enforcement system loves more than to punish a hero. If you act the white knight, expect to be crucified for it, because anybody who usurps Caesar's role will be targeted in turn, even if Caesar isn't filling his role. (Ask Kyle R.) ... Love the story. Wish this world HAD a sense of justice, the way the song portrays. Feels good to sing along with it a for a bit, though. Peace be with you.
I love hardy when this song came out I was so happy
That girl got some talent and assets , lol.
I knew someone like the fictitious woman in the song.  I worked for them and I would be across the yard, road, and barn lot on the far side and when he hit her I could hear it.  They were in the house and you could hear the thud and sometimes seconds would go by before you heard her scream.  I was a very young boy who needed a job desperately so I would just run home.  A long time after I had last worked for them the woman died of natural causes and about a year later the pri*k went to her grave, laid on it and he used a pistol to blow his fuc&ing brains out.  Too bad he didn't do that 20 years sooner!
Great song 🎶 Great chemistry 🧪 One of my new favorites ♥️
Sexiest woman in this whole wide world
hang on to this guy!
That's my truck!!
My boy! Hardy and Lainey killed this song!
Man that a hellva dumptruck!
Thank God for Country music!  2022 biological men are (trans-BS) as girls and destroying all female athlete sports. Drag Queen shows in Library's etc.....Where are these "Gender-Freaks" FATHERS? This song is about our grandfathers and great-grandfathers respect for all women..period! Sadly...it appears boys want to become girls??? WTF
Lainey Wilson gotta have a cdl good lord
I'd give just about anything to take that lady to dinner
NALED IT!!!!!
He got and deseved
Dang she got a dumper on her
These lyrics suck! Literally sounds like they took words from every other country song and threw it all together. Best thing here honestly is what we're all here for, my boys know! Lol
Who came here from the viral Twitter post on her badonk👀
Hell yeah, welcome back true country 😀
Lainey sounds so much like Dolly in this performance
CAKES.
Dump - truck.  She is all up in the dump truck.   Lord Lainie 😂
Gas 🔥🔥
I would be singing this song if anyone ever touches one of my daughters, granddaughters or yes even one of my daughter in laws This should be movie theme
Lainey Wilson & Cody Johnson needs to happen
Great song.  Amazing performance.  Brilliant song writing.
REAL COUNTRY AND THE 🔥 A$$ TO BOOT.......
The line "I don't know if he's an angel, cause angels don't do what he did" has got me everytime. Listening this morning idk why but the answer came. Yes absolutely an angel .. Ephesians 6:11-13 put on the whole armor of god, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. "Men" (and that word is used loosely as a descriptor) who hit women and touch children are absolutely the devil and there is no fixing it
Best song 👌 loved it 💗 both performed perfect. This is the country music I like
This song triggered some terrible memories for me, as with a lot of the women I know. Great country song writing...I hope to hear more from them.
Hardy sounds like *trailer trash*
However, it wasn’t a double door he kicked in in the video. It was a single wide. Great song though lol
😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  fire them
What a GEM! New to me it just blows me away. I just became a fan!
Just goes to show you how these good old southern boys were raised
YEP WE CAN Always use a man like this
I think the message of this song isn't the murder. It's that, no matter how crazy or tough you are (not that you have to be tough to beat a woman), if you beat a woman, there's a good chance that eventually, you're going to run across someone that tougher, and crazier, and would rather kill you than look at you.
Powerful take notes people and songwriters this is country music
Chills and goosebumps country is back in this song lanny will u marry me
Sic
I think Hardy revived country. Bless
Just wow,:( Thank you both for being a voice for people , who don't have the right words to explain these situations. Thank you from the bottom of my heart
Man I would love to hear him cover copperhead road.
AMAZING song n performance  !!!     Wow
I love me some Jelly Roll and up until this Song I was really hoping he would take song of the year this up coming year but now I'm gonna be pissed off big mad if this isn't Song of the year!!! Hardy my guy You hit it out the park and this one should put You at the top!!
I definitely downloaded it for sure 😃😊
Lainey is freakin awesome
How'd they get a pickup and a dump truck there 🤔
This song may even have more impact than “The Thunders Rolls” by Garth, even with the third verse.
Both are awesome.
That is 1 BAD song ,love it
Dumb song!! What kind of loser is gonna spend the rest of his life in jail to murder the man of an abused woman he just met on the side of the road? Fuckin dumbed down music!!!
Hardy is given me kurt Sutter  look... is class love the song love...
Guy, I SEEN my mom get beat up, so many times, love your door, , door too many awakenings.., meaning, the past is the past, but not let the future too include..
The sad reality of this song were real life she would find another abusive relationship
Is it just me, or does Lainey Wilson remind you of a modern day version of Tanya Tucker? Great song performed by two great artists!
Wow my dad actually showed me this song.  What an  angel 😇  didn't even know her and  saved her life we need more people like that in the world.
DAMN!!!!! THIS IS A MASTERPIECE  GREAT JOB & I WANT THIS SONG TO WIN EVERY AWARD AVAILABLE.
That happen to me by my ex
I am amazed with the song I Love it
I got 2 things to say... 1. Got damn ol' girl got dem hips like Selena Quintanilla! Even had to show my husband like oooooohweee!  😜  2. Idk who in heck Hardy is but after that performance, he's found himself a brand new fan! The man sang his ass off! Bravo my guy, bravo!
Lainy got goosebumps goin through her vains you go girl
this song is fucking terrible and isnt even country
She’s a beautiful dually !!!! Lol
This is absolutely amazing song and man the stage props and decorations really help tell the story this is the kind of country music I like not this new stuff that's about rapping and mudding ridding and twerking I like stories like this that really means something. And that truck my dad has the exact same truck exact same color and all he has had it since I was born lot of memories in his truck of course not only vehicle we owned but the most favorite one in my childhood and still in my adult hood I'm 31 and still ride with him in that truck and love every minute of it and with my son in the middle between us makes it even better. I paid to have it fully restored body paint frame off restoration back to oem specs and man it's gonna be in my son's life as well
I love this song it's so awesome.diffently my favorite song ...now this is country music at it's best.
I heard this song the first time a week ago I've had it on repeat ever since but this live version OMG the way he starts slow and brings it to the top at the end by far my favorite song I have ever heard and best performance I have ever seen this song gives me chills 4 different times throughout the way she put everything into it at the end and he matches her energy with that final Lord have Mercy on me what a voice Country music is back
♡  Very touching as I been there b4...
This song is very meaningful. The first man is so pathetic, while the second one sacrificed his freedom. Let's see...which one is best....
I can’t believe the emotion they infused this performance with. I’ve lost track of the times I’ve seen this since the awards show and it puts dust in my eyes every time.
True country song This is how it is supposed to be done
Real men never touch a lady in anger. Very powerful song.
Award winning song right here ❤️🫶🏻🎶
AWESOME !!!!! Great job
I would probably do the same thing hardy did if I came cross this
Never heard of Laney Wilson before this song, but her voice is AMAZING! I would love to see her go the same route as Tanya Tucker. Stay traditional and bring country BACK
Country music will be in good hands with these two! This song is absolutely the best!!
I can’t wait to see him in Fenway this summer.
I've been waiting for country to bring back story songs... let's get it Nashville
"smokin' one of his cigarettes..."     Man, that's a classy country version of "I just kicked your ass, son."
❤️
The best
First time I heard this song I cried and that hasn’t happened in YEARS.
Yes it's a very great song but he sings this song who sings about a woman getting hit FYI he beat the s*** out of his wife at  a hotel l room when he was on The voice a few years ago he's a wife beater
Love this song!
Ladies, get your own Taurus Judge and learn how to use it. Seriously, all you need is a .38 to protect yourselves but please don't put up with anyone abusing you.
Performance of the year
@ 3:55 just damn!!!!!!!
This is really not that good.  Country music is shell of what it once was. Like everything today it’s all money making
It was coming across this performance on BBC4 in the UK that made me go and listen to everything you've released before. Amazing. Truly amazing
I love you hardy! I remember when you were writing songs for Blake Shelton! I stayed with you when you were talking about buck blood on your clothes and Slim Jim's in your floorboard! And now to see how far you have come, talking series topics like  domestic abuse in a different light that most artists would be afraid to paint in this day and age! You truly are becoming a legend in my eyes man. I don't know how many times I have cried to signed sober you and broke boy... They have helped me through a hard time in my life. I can never thank you enough... But thank you! Truly you are transcending country and rock!
This has to be the song of the year,  the writing is the best. I don't know how many times I've listened to it. In my years of nursing I seen women that needed someone to save them.  This is story telling at it's best.
Love this song
Goose bumps !
Fucking beautiful. Nuff said
Gah damn she got da wagon
my favorite
Thank you for this incredible song 💜💜💜💜
Love this song any man lays hand to woman isn't a man I been there few times in my life
Today's music SUCKS!
My husband is going nuts we love this song omg. But he’s trying to find out what make and year the truck is
Powerful performance 👏
Good artists but the guy in the story is a complete dumba$$. Men please DO NOT DO THIS. Dumbest story ever. Captain save a hoe gets life in prison.
Bad ass 🤠👍
You can close your eyes and see the story they are telling.  Very powerful
This performance is so bad ass. I listen to this song almost daily.
Love this song i like both singers
I’m truly surprised CMA allowed somebody like Hardy to perform, he’s too raw for Hollywood
I hate how singers make a great song and then there head gets big did you hear how she ruined the song by trying to raise her voice to high and out for attention now hardy needs to get Laney in check or replace her if she gonna act crazy and mess up the song
Kick ass song
One of the most amazing songs I've ever heard.  These two Killed it !!!
That song is not a homerun, it's a Grand Slam !!!  Congrats to those two !  :)

I guess this is what they call Country nowadays not according to me
Wow ! Powerful and beautifully sang. Thank you.
I wished they would of put "thank you" in the song not just the music video :) either way it's such an incredible song.
I believe Lainey an hard has something here
WOW !!!!!!!
The line "I might be here forever, it ain't paradise that's true, but it's a whole  hell of a lot better then the place I sent him to" one of the best lines in music
Let's all just say AMAZING! I just more men would stand with a broken woman! Very powerful message!
AMAZING!
thats not the same truck XD
Her heart isn’t the only thing that’s like a truck
MAKES ME CRY BUT ITS AMAZING SONG
Best song and duo I've heard in a long time,that's country!!
Wow! Enough said…
John Goodman says hello if you know you know!
Perfect.
Best duet!!!
This song is so good
Hardy is just amazing, and he made an awesome choice in having Laney sing this one with him! Glad he chose to sing this one himself and not let someone else record it. I'm not sure it would be the same if it were anyone else.
This song gave me goosebumps the first time I heard it.
I actually like the song but to correlate the lyrics to an actual event occurrence in reality is ABSURD. As some knight comes along some random gal that’s beat up and without due process just takes the strangers word and executes the man that’s supposedly the bad guy. What desperate loser would do this in real life - meet a random person and hear their version of a story, even if they look like they had an ass kickin, and they get their gun immediately and hunts them down. Lol dumbest story ever. Imo
It’s crazy how good they both are wow there voices are amazing damn
Absolutely beautiful and well sung .
I don't think anybody knows what the song means to me questions to myself I can't fully understand it. For me it's raped molestation and physical abuse emotional and people trying to compromise where they worth, you only God can judge me my judgment is not for nobody by him. Am I worth belongs to him and whoever needs to hear that tonight yours does too.Amen hallelujah
This 45 year old black woman loves this song!!!! Me and hubby sing it all the time!
Hardy is an Angel 😇
Good Goobly Goo !!!!
Best song I've heard in a long time.
Wow, that was dog shit
Masterpiece ❤️💯
I can see what yall trying to do... but yall missing all of it.... 🤣🤣🤣 which IN MY EYES looks RETARTED AF. LMAO && that is IN FACT the FAKEST ACCENT IVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE .... HILARIOUS. Get some RAISINS!
The power behind these two performers with such a heart touching song! Absolutely incredible!
Hardy at 3:52-...damn.
❤️🌸🔥🔥🔥
i wish i was there
Best song currently on the air, and one of the best story book songs made period. Also puts DV on notice, maybe some vengeance now and then ain't such a bad thing???
On a positive note. I really love that ole Chevy. She's beautiful

First time hearing Lainey sing ! will be listening to her songs
This song is great 👍 👌
Love it, but she sounds way to country to be wearing a straight brim hat. I hope that's not going to become "the style". It won't fly here in TX, but who knows? Mullets made a comeback after all
“I never thought my day of Justice would come from a judge under a seat.”  One of the most badass lines I’ve ever heard
The legend of country music would be proud of this one!
Top Drawer....
A lot of people don't know how much Hardy writes songs for other artists. Hardy wrote "God's Country" gave it to Blake Shelton and told him he had a week to record it or Hardy would. Five days later... Blake Shelton did "God's Country". I never knew that. Hardy is an incredible artist  both writer and singer. Love him. ❤️ The Mississippi boy.
Lainey got a dump truck
A country song that tells a dark and poignant story, and one that isn't about partying. I am here for it.
Awesome,  one of my favorites of all time..
Kane Brown has no idea what music is.  Besides, he can't sing.  His wife is a joke.   His latest collaboration (thank god) with his wife is nothing but a total flop.
You know hardy has been in the scene well behind the scenes for a few years now and has written a few great songs for Morgan, Blake, and more and he could hv giving this song to someone else like I could see Morgan singing this too and doing good with it but I'm soooo glad he decided to sing it himself cause he kills it!!
Hardy can sing in his lower register but damn when he goes up he hits those notes effortlessly man great singer we don't hv many like him anymore most are on the same oh hip hop kinda country🤷‍♂️😁
dakota glasson lovoer too yyou 24 you  25
Can we just appreciate a great iconic song... plus also appreciate how beautiful Lainey is just a naturally beautiful southern lady with a voice that is at the top of the list😁🤷‍♂️😉 her looks kinda reminds me a faith hill in the 90s🤷‍♂️😁 and not just anyone can rock those bell bottoms but deee-aaam she rocks them things greatly 😉
I get chills every time I hear this song! We needed a song like this. Survivors needed this song! It has such a personal meaning for me.
Damn good song!
2 of the best❤
Hardy this song is good and. Lainey Wilson. She is awesome. God bless you this holiday season
I love HARDY especially this song I know all the lyrics and it just hits you know?? I love it!!!!!! It's sooo bad ass!!!!

Nice old Chevy  I would love to have one just like it I also wouldn’t mind having her sitting next to me in it😊
I could be happy my entire life to marry her voice
Great story and song
Attention everybody!  My voice is very important. Kane Brown can't sing.   We don't want to see a tone-deaf person at the ACM awards, cuz his voice is not listenable.  Even my 6 year old son can sing better than Kane Brown. Kane Brown is musically tone-deaf.  How is he still in music business?   How?   How can a tone-deaf person be a country singer?  Kane Brown has to be terminated from music business as soon as possible. Kane Brown is unable to distinguish between different pitches in tone or sound as he has trouble singing the right notes.  Kane Brown is unable to perceive differences of musical pitch.   He can't sing and is not even qualified to be a singer.  He sings like a toddler.  By the way I love every county singer except Kane Brown.  @Starbaby So, you get your commission from Kane Brown for all those fake comments and views in every Kane Brown's music videos!  Are you trying to impress/convince Kane Brown that you need more money?  Everybody knows Kane Brown can't have a descent stage performance at the ACM awards cuz he's tone-deaf.  Stop being needy and stop lying to the world........

Yeppers, Dean Larsen in Libby, Montana this is for you!!!! You POS that made my baby sister suffer at a man’s hand for wayyyyyyyyyy to many F ing years…GOD knows this song has been my prayer for U wayyyyyyyyy to DAMN long!!!!… Thank You HARDY

Incredible! It's real, yet eerie; reminds me alot of Waylon's "Cedartown, Georgia" & Jamey Johnson " Heartache""- (just a different reason for justice); all 3 of these songs tell the cold hard facts of life. Finally, some Real country is back with a female artist. Thanks Lainey.
That’s called REAL TALENT❤

My husband told me to wait in the truck when we first started dating
Found this song a couple of days ago. Outstanding! It is country music as it should be!
Never a been a country fan but damn this song gives me chills. These two are amazing artists
Hardy is the Tom T Hall of today!
Hardy is one if not the Best Song Writing Story Tellers to Hit Nashville in sometime now!! Let's hope there Will be More to come Just Lile This!!! These 2 performing Together is Amazing!!
This is what country music has been missing for a long time I think god he brought you on this earth to put these song that tell the truth in real life situations love it man keep doing what your doing yr awesome this is so true what a country music needs is you thank you
Hell ya brother
EXCELLENT
Completely obsessed with this song
Hardy The Steel Woods Whitey Morgan & The 78s Jamey Johnson Sturgill Corb Lund Hayes Carll Charley Crockett  these folks are parts of the answer to The Possum's famed question.
Not only did they tell a story but the way they present it just makes me honestly fall so much more in love with country again. I just can't wait to just listen and re listen to this song. It's amazing how they told a story about something woman go through but make no mistake it's not condoning going to find a man who hits a woman but if you can help please please do so.
Awesome performance! And I spy HARDY’s Mississippi State earpiece #hailstate
These two are going places for sure♡♡
It's a lovely song but it doesn't show the true song and with them singing together doesn't show the real story
Beautiful song
I love this song but he sounded terrible

This is a song about a man who discovered a random injured woman in the street and immediately decided he was going to commit the worst sin in the book(murder) on whoever inflicted the abuse, regardless of the situation. The man in the song decided to end another man's life without knowing ANYTHING at all about the complicated relationship the woman CHOSE to be in, at least initially. As someone who has seen a tremendous amount of violence and mental/physical abuse, it's never a good idea to hear one side of a story and unilaterally jump to the conclusion that you need to pour your own life down the drain over a random stranger. This is effectively telling your parents to forget about the hopes and dreams they have for you because you have to avenge a woman you just met who is actually still alive and will probably find herself in the same exact scenario in the near future.🤦‍♂️
Jelly roll for No.1
On Oct 30 th I took a picture of how many subscribers Hardy had it was 293 thousand subscribers and now he has 310 thousand on Nov 21st. Excited to see where your carrier goes. 😊
This song should be on all radio stations. It brings to the forefront a huge problem in this world. I believe it would make someone think before they would beat someone they claim to love. Never know when that one good man may come along and never allow this crime to never be committed on at least one woman again. Thank-you Hardy.

My favorite song right now! ✅️
This hits home
That stare @ 3:17 tho 🔥🔥
This was also my story.cant thank my friends enough,who got me out
You  both kick ass!! This tells one hell of a story
I didn’t load her down with questions…..  my brother died from fentanyl in 2019. He’d be this man if he didn’t. My now ex husband went on the attack when I became vulnerable. He punched a hole in the wall while our 3 year old twin girls were playing dress up and I was naked just out of the shower. They never forget that.  Another time in 2021 he charged me, knocked the phone out of my hand and punched a hole in the wall so badly he broke his hand, had surgery with steel plates.  He threatened to kill me in-front of four other people. He called CPS on me, falsely accusing me of child abuse. Falsely accused me of Assault and Battery. I protected him, because he paid the bills. My life has been a narcissist dateline episode.  I’m alive. Today I heard this song for the first time… I was driving to the salon to get my hair done for the second time this year, I missed my exit balling in tears.  So true. God Bless.
Gosh I love this song. Both of them inspire me. Love y'all 💗 gave me goosebumps!!
Great voice, but I cannot figure out how a person has the upper body of Halle Berry and the lower body of Oprah.
Best live performance
This is 100% what country music needs. Hell ya 🍻
Amen brother
I love your voice
Amazing, modern country with something to say, I’m an instant fan
What an outstanding performance… two exceptional country artists…. plus that beautiful Chevy pickup. ‘68?
This songs awesome should be #1 just my option #hardy never disappoints
Lainey is CAKED up. Good lord woman.
Who wrote this song??! ❤️❤️❤️ WOW 🥺 these two are my new favorites and whoever wrote this song deserves an award. This performance also deserves an award. It's already won one in my heart ❤️‼️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
There is something about this song that is so powerful.  I’ve played it on repeat for about 2 hours and it is just as good and emotionally powerful as the first time I heard it. I didn’t know much about about Hardy prior to this, bug I’m a fan now!
Sounds like he's hurting a bit (from the accident)
🔥 great song and performance. This is so relatable to anyone that has dealt with  or seen domestic abuse/violence.
Anyone who thinks this is good or real as why the music industry is dying. All awards shows are just lip singing.
WOW
My God send a his glorious mercy on the both of you for this colab
Hail State! love the earbuds.
Great song
They sound great together but I find this song disturbing. Obviously domestic violence is terrible but so is murder. He killed a man for a woman he met 10 minutes before. 🤨
Beautiful
Idk how people call this country music.. Idk how people call this good..  I don't understand
Hardy is good looking
And I said country was dead and gone Waylon johnny Keith and  ole possum bocephus rest well and listen to your legacy  My heart is lighter for just seeing this and what they are saying needs to be put on signs  break the cycle
love the song best performance of the  CMAs
You two Rock!
Love the song but hated the performance 🤷🏼‍♂️
So damn powerful.  Love you both.
He sounds like he's sick
Next Dolly and Charlie
🙃🙂🤪🥰🤗
Carrie underwood and Miranda lambert better look out because dolly parton with a attitude is about steal their thunder love this need to see more from these two
Go Hardy! - Save! Brazil suffered electoral fraud. For a Lula Communist!
Wow, I’m not one for award shows but gawd damn!!! This performance was incredible! Great song and this performance put it on a whole new level!! These two performed it with so much passion. Not even sure that word does it justice. The words don’t exist to describe this performance. Count me in as a new fan of both these artists!
Never heard of Hardy before the CMT awards and now I'm obsessed. Thank you for this beautiful song.
Best song of 2022!!
bad ass!
The first time I heard this song no bs I listened to it over and over for 3 hours straight 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️I love it❤
Wow, glad I got to see it performed.  Great song.
They didn't have to go this hard
Laney Wilson sounds like a mix of Reba, Dolly
I mean, I love Hardy. For real. But Lainey…. Girl is fire!!!
This is what country use to be. Great damn song Hardy.
Have you ever been told wait in the truck?
I was that girl one time..
Great performance!!!! Such great talent. Love this.
Hardy should have won a award for this video alone!!!
This was awe-inspiring.
That booty. Damn!
Best vocal for the year
Fucking killed it.
Beautiful. You both are blessed with fantastic voices and the lyrics.... Wow. God' has a good plan for you ❤️🙏
If the title of the song is "Wait in the car", why did she get out?
Cool 😎
Good for you Laine!
That truck is the best part of this performance
Beautiful song love this song
The greatest song!!! If you've been on the other side , you understand!! Keep it up y'all !!!
Fucking 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!! Best performance I've EVER seen!!!!
Saving country music.👍💪✌️💙
Thicker than trying to whistle with Nutella
After hearing this song, I have much bigger respect for you HARDY. Congratulations to you and Lainey Wilson 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
AWESOME PERFORMANCE Hardy and Lainey!  As a DV survivor,  you don't know much this song means to me.  Thank you both so much!!!  💓
Don't see what all the fuss is about.  She's terrible.
Chills!!!
I relate to this song very much
I've watched this 4 times. Damn.....good.......
Best damn song I have ever heard!!!! DV Survivor💜 myself!!!!!
Hey, you have a few fingers without rings on them… better get on that.  Lord, please help the doucheness of the world
I have goose bumps
Congrats to Lianey on her award!
Hardy would have been an awesome character in the  best show of all time Sons of Anarchy
Everyone praising the song. Y’all realize he’s talking about straight up murdering some random dude on the sole fact a woman was standing in the road 😂  Put it in the real world. Y’all would be the first people calling this man a monster for murdering a random person he does not know on the information of some other random person he does not know
Wow!!!
Even she's throwing up the baphomet huh? Sad
Props to CMAs for not burying this song because of the subject matter, response to said matter, and mention of cigarettes.
Amazing!!
I absolutely love Lainey’s attitude!!! Her voice is truly amazing!!!
Between that Beer Belly and that song, this is what country music is supposed to be
You live in deep south you walk. We take care of our own
Just amazing
I just became a fan great music brother
Modern country makes me fucking sick!!!....... this gives me cold chills every time I hear it Lol Take a lesson boy's, there's more Hardy's than douche bags!! 😉
Who knew Hardy loved Michigan?😂
Lainey is a damn dime
A friend just shared this with me.  Wow.  My security and protector is a real Angel now but for many many years prior, he became a, Sex Offender and Abuse Officer.  Damn I miss my brother so much but I know he is still here watching over me.  My Security and Protector from Heaven now.
Thank you for bringing attention to domestic violence, your voices are incredible too!  👏 Great song and artists
I cry every time I hear this! This is what real country music is…Tells a story that needs to be heard!! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PERFORMANCE OF AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SONG!! ❤❤❤❤
I heard this song just 2 days after I was severely physically beaten by my estranged x. Even with my eyes swollen shut, (and many other injuries) I still managed to cry, and some tears did fall. This is such an emotional song that I am sure hits right on the heart of us, ones who have survived such horrific attacks.  I almost didn't.
Awesome performance and song! 🎵
It's been a very long road where you've come from to where you are now... and it's just gonna get higher and higher. Congrats my man! Thoroughly deserved 👏
What an incredible story this song tells. If only the justice system forgave men who would do this for a battered woman.
The New Johnny & June right here folks!! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🥃🥃
All the song writers in Nashville take note...that is how you write a country song  !!! The days of story telling in country music has returned....thank you !!!!!
I've heard better. That's sad always about abuse, booze and what everelse. Can't we sing happier songs. Not my favorite singers.
Great song !
She’s sooo sexy
I would like to meet hardy some day set around a campfire and sing a few songs including give heaven some hell
I LOVE Lainey’s voice with that twang
Best song written in many a year…..many a year
Love love love the song, did not like this live performance though. Quite pitchy and just sounded weird. Again LOVE this song
I can not get enough of this song. It needs to go to the top of the charts.
I really missed country music sounding like this and telling a raw story!! Amazing🔥🔥🔥
good lawd she is wearin them pants
Damn “whiskey scars” just wow another classic country lyric to go with “ain’t your memory got no pride” or “wish I could wear a rainbow everyday and tell the worlds it’s ok” just wow this is amazing song!!
Best Ass in the Game 👍
Just remember men their are 2 sides to a story dont be capatain save a hoe you could do life for a situation she brought on herself with her actions
First time I heard this song I cried and had goosebumps. If only all us DV victims had a hero like this. I got out ran 200 miles to get away.
Powerful. Thank you for this song!
Amazing ❤️
Something magical about it !
It's time to get back to the basic's, "KEEPING IT REAL!" That's what country music is all about! Awesome! 💯💓
What is the most powerful songs I have ever heard
Wow! So much emotion in this song 🎵 I definitely teared up. I was abused in my past for different things and my outcome in my life is of God's grace and love for me. I hope this songs brings awareness to those needed to hear this. God bless you and Thank you!
Fekin brilliant 👏👏
Love that hardy is finally getting some recognition
That is one hell of a dumptruck. Great performance too!
Holy shit this was so good made my hair stand up
I still cry every time I see this video or hear the song
Wish they would play this on the radio already absolutely best song out right now. And there's a fee good hits out but this one hit home...
It ain't paradise that's true But it's a whole hell of a lot better Than the place I sent him to  WOW!!!!!
And I thought the original song gave me goosebumps... Damn.  This is Thunder Rolls Garth status!
💯❤
This is awesome.. 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Look at the shitter on that critter.
Hardy you have a new fan. Thank you for this incredible song. 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lol this sucks why is everything fake now  days🤪
What a Strong performance , been awhile since the CMA’s had real country - Best I’ve seen in years - These two brought it for sure !!!!!
awesome song
Such a powerful song.. Never hit your girl or your man.. Angels are watching !!
This was great! Kinda reminds me of cain Velazquez’s situation
Ok serious…. 1: hardy has one of the best song writing abilities in all music genres currently. 2: this is one of the best sounding live performances I have ever seen. 3: she is absolutely beautiful/stunning and sounds like the definition of country music. 4: I want more music between these two
This song gives me chills
I was born in 1970, and I love Lainey's style! This is my new #1 song right now because boys, we know what he is feeling right there!
Goose bumps
lets gooooo!!! Hardy coming for all the awards next year!!
Damn they both have that range and know how to use it. He is a talent that has been around for a while and just keeps getting better and better. And she will be here for a while with that voice.
😀 Cool video, I like this song!
Looks like Hardy and Lainey just brought country back.
That was Best duet of the year. Hardy is the real deal. Not only that was a great song,but fantastic performances. I am so glad to see artists not afraid to put the real issues out there...BROVO HARDY AND LAINEY! This was a great song and great performance by the both of them.
💛❤
Amazing performance from both
Awesome song and video
ME!! THANK YOU! ❤️YOU!!
Best song i have heard since Chris Jensen “Take a Drunk Girl Home”
Hardy just continues to amaze
Idk but hardy makes me think of Brantley Gilbert.  hmm. Might be because he one of the real ones on mainstream idk 🤷‍♂️
Whoo hoo!! Two new powerhouses in the country world. This duet was on fire!!   🔥 💯 💥
How could it have taken Nashville 10 years to recognize  Lainey...so glad we get to hear her
This is the first live video I've ever loved! I just saw the live while ago! I love the video of this song also! This is one of the best songs and videos ever to come out! It hits home bad!
My new #1
As a survivor of domestic abuse. I wanna say thank you for this song. This would of been my life if I didn't leave him when I did. I can't stop blaring this song.
Thank you for bringing back real country music. 🙏😭
Good job kids👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏻🇺🇸🤙🏻🌺
I'm so glad to see this performance.  I get up at 2:30 am to got to work. Didn't catch the CMA'S .
This song is going to be a country classic. One that will be played for years to come. AWESOME story AMAZING voices. Please please bring back more real country songs like this one.
This song is marginal. I’m a big Hardy fan but this one is a bad sign for his upcoming album. Also, that’s a hell of a “Country outfit” that ol’ girl is wearing. Looks more like a Cardi B outfit than a country song outfit
I heard this a time or two when my husband had his Pandora going and last night it came up again so I had to find it. I don't normally like country but this HITS.
What a joke lmfao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eeeewww this guy can't sing its like he is off key, just horrible
That live performance gave me goosebumps, you 2 have one hell of a great chemistry, I so want more from you 2 as a duo.
Just wait in the corner
Still loving this ❤️!
جميل١١.١٣
Love this song as soon as I heard It 💓  Lifetime fan
Now this is a real country song
There is not enough word to explain how incredible these 2 performers are and the song just hits you right in the heart.
Hardy just gets better and better with every new song he writes 🙏🏽
Always Amazing!
Now we need a followup song where he gets out and they live happily ever after *food for thought
Best song writer, story teller and poet in country music
Why wasn't this even nominated for song or single of the year?  Was it released too late to be considered?  Should have won at least one, probably both...  Powerful song, which I would imagine means a huge amount to many people.
yeah man oh yeah
Hey that boy good!
That was freaking awesome! Incredible song which gives me goosebumps and Incredible performance! Love ❤️ this!
Best duet of the year. Hardy is the real deal.
Just absolutely brilliant this old man has not heard country music like this? It takes me back to the '80s Bravo keep up the Great work!
Why can't Lainey Wilson just sing normal? Trynna be all fancy....and anyone notice her ass cheeks hang down really really low? 😂😂
Talk about "original", wow. Soooo good!!!
🥂💫
HARDY is the real deal. Been on him for a few years now. Major talent waiting to happen…
Amazing Performance. You got this! I am so very Proud to call you my Cousin. My Family
MWH, Aunt Lib is smiling from Heaven. She loved you and MHD so very much.
when you hit tgat high note it Made me cry , this was the best birthday gift ever, since my birthday is on the 13th. thank you. Keep it up
WOW what a woman!
Epic Performance By Hardy and Lainey Wilson definitely the performance of the night.
Why is it that if you wear a camo ball cap and park a truck on stage that makes you a country singer. Never saw Buck Owens park a truck on stage. Never saw George Strait wear a camo ball cap. This new country crap is just plain baddddddddddd.
This is awkward and the guy singing is annoying. The truck is nice.
Sorry not sorry my Sagittarius ex girlfriend needs to be beat up by an abusive man so she can actually see what kind of abuser she is I will never get back with her ever again good riddance
The video is awesome, but that was a spectacular performance, wow!!, I think i will watch it again, and maybe again🙄powerful!!
Lainey..so old school voices..I love it!
This live performance of this song was raw & powerful.  It gives ne chills over & over.  It was awesome.   Hardy's voice is amazing & his songwriting is wicked crazy good.  He is the genuine real country boy.  He, Earnest & my boy Wallen what a hell of a group of talented artists.  Kudos to Hardy for winning songwriter of the year by the BMI's.
Best male and female, in the industry. Don't you 2 ever change! Keep this attitude and you will go farther than the rest
I get chills every time I hear this song. Its so good. I love it😍
Haha, cool song about being a hero
Most mid song I’ve heard in a while.
Good song but she doesn’t have to try so hard. Makes her not sound that great
Considering the trend with DA's and prosecutors around the country, expect "Hardy" to be brought up on attempted murder chargers with those lyrics... 3 r & b artists have already been indicted b/c of there lyrics and no other evidence, so unless its a RACAIL thing..  :/
Main stream country music sucks. It’s cookie cuter bullshit. Anyone who thinks this is art should be ashamed of themselves.
Damnit guys! #HARDY #LaineyWilson Edit again! 3.2.23 This is by far (in my opinion) the best version of this song! If the hairs don't rise up on your neck....YOUR DEAD!  that's just the music side.  The story side...if it doesn't speak to your soul....YOUR DEAD!
He was an angle
Hardy, come to Canada on your tour! I am telling you we are obsessed up here
Such a powerful song.
did they win ?????????
Hold my beer: "exists" Hardy:
Country has needed this for some time!  Great song!
So proud of you Hardy!  Keep it up! ♥️
I love this song.
This tune and this  duet are  amazing 🤩🤩
he's just trying to raise the value of that truck. this whole thing is about how much money he can sell it for.       the song sucks
Yes, more songs about vigilante justice. Some guy driving around, lost; picks up a total stranger who he assumes has “whiskey scars” since he didn’t “load her down with questions.” Murders a complete stranger who he knows nothing about, even steals one his cigarettes. He gets life in prison, yet as far as we know she served no time for being an accomplice to the homicide. And while he is doing life, how does he know she won’t fall into another abusive relationship. Yeah, I think I’ll wait in the truck on this one, too. Great song, but don’t take it as a solution or an anthem.
I no longer fear for the future of country music! This is 🔥
Not really a fan of all the new country but there's something about this duet that has shades of some of the greats. Both have great voices maybe they can cover some classics
So good!!!!!!
I love 💕 Hardy's voice
DAMN Lainey is lookin top notch! What a powerful song!
If you’re beating on women this exactly the outcome you deserve. What a song and performance!
Omg I love this song ❤❤❤
So he just kicks in the door and blasts some dude? After finding a beat up chick in the road? That's damn near first degree murder in my jurisdiction
Damn!
Cma is a dang joke now a days
This is my new favorite song
The more I listen to that song the more I really like it. Great Live performances.
I like a little bit of country music.  This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.  When a man tells you to wait in the truck.... someone is gonna get handled,  wasted or something is about to go 💣💥💥💥💀☠️
The song gives me the chills. But I like the duet of Hardy and Lainey Wilson.
I new that small town young man would make it one day even the first time i ever saw him KEEP IT GOING LANNIE
POWERFUL
Let just be real hardy and Laney are just such a good duo and a couple like hardy is like the best country singer in the world laney has such an amazing voice when I watched the show on tv I was like out of all the country singers out there hardy is my favorite laney did such a good job on singing wait in the truckl like hardy lane amazing job you are my number one favorite nice job
Live version sucked... neither could sing worth a crap
Finally a song with a story behind the song gives me kid rock and Cheryl Crow vibes
What about feminist that can shoot there own gun,,,,
🎂
Hardy is a great singer and Lainey are both a great singer
YEE YEE  ..........  HELL YEAH  ---------------  AWESOME  SONG
Best duet & performance! ❤
Just absolutely brilliant this old man has not heard country music like this? It takes me back to the '80s Bravo keep up the Great work!
AMAZING!!!!
First actually country song that been performed in years at the cma
Lainey got Dat ass
All of Lainey's movements distracted from the music.  This was kind of mediocre compared to the video and other live performances.
First heard it on TikTok and have had it on repeat for weeks now.  Hardy is an amazing writer!!
Love this,do another song together ❤️
That last “Have Mercy” when ya boy belts it💪🏼🥵💪🏼 just damn!
First time I heard it tore me up, pulled the truck over and just sat to think. Had me thinking about my wife, been married only a few months and the shitbag she was once married to.   From day one their was an understanding between him and I as to what would occur if he ever so much as raised his voice to her....How I LOATHE "men" who hurt the women they are sworn to protect.
At the end was just wow
Keeping it "Real Country."   Fabulous song and fantastic performance !!!
Hear it a hundreds times and I still get chills when Lainey’s voice comes in
This songs success shows you how starving our culture is for MEN. No society can survive without masculine men. Men are, by nature, protectors and providers. We live in a culture that has shamed and demasculinized men.
She has a beautiful/powerful voice
He can’t sing worth a shit. Painful
All I can say these 2 are absolutely amazing but together a power house I hope they work together more often love this song one of the best performances that night
It is so painful for me to watch award shows. All the pretense; a chance to communicate how compassionate the organizations, and its members are towards minority races, etc instead of celebrating their own product that comes from their artists and other professionals; all the celebs they bring in that have nothing to do with today's country music; leaving out many who are relevant on country radio, etc. Bad attempts at humor. Hosts who are outside the genre. This one was no different.  But I watched this one, to see this song performed live on TV, and to support them allowing a previously banned artist. It was worth it for the HARDY/Lainey performance.
That is what I call country
Bravo 👏
This live performance has brought this song to another level. Hardy's story telling is just phenomenal, and Lainey's vocal here is spotless. I can feel that they both pulled out their heart in this song and in this performance.
Awesome song.  And duo.  Hope to hear more.   And can't wait to see her on Yellowstone
At end Lainey is way to much hardy is chill
Love hardy voicen
Lainey trying to hard hardy perfect trying hard speed
Michael Shannon in front row
EPIC. AMAZING. PERFECTION.
Wow Lainey was pumped for this. Incredible to see the excitement in her body language
This sad song
Hardy is a bad ass! But how did this girl beat out Miranda for female vocalist of the year?
Is it just me or does lainey give jack sparrow vibes
I hope you both go far. I knew this song was gonna blow up when I listened to it months ago and it only had 25k views.
This was bad ass! Freakin awesome song & great performance! " I never thought my day of Justice would come from a Judge under a seat".. Wow, that's one hell of a lyric.
That's a pretty ass truck!!!
Easily 2 of my favorite newer artists out now!! Song of the year!!! ❤
Can this man get a fucking CMA award already?? He’s blowing everyone else out of the water…
Amazing content and hot damn! If she doesn't look just absolutely amazing.
Best song like this since church bells. Brantley Gilbert tried making a couple but they didn't feel authentic in the right way. Hardy continues to expand himself.
WOW! Trigger song. Thank you, for putting this out and bringing more attention life's uglier side, & choices some people face . Touching on the hard subjects!
There is only one song comparable to Reba McEntire "The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia" and that would be this one. Like rebas song, this song too has one hell of a story to it. Not only that but what a epic setting they preformed this song on... Love the truck, wish I had one like it but that won't happen just like the girl in the song won't get beaten ever again... Thank you for this performance
Fantastic performance!
Sometimes the only justice that can be found is the justice we find for ourselves.  Semper Fi!
hardy man. he's the best
I ll say this man is beyond awesome .his voice his music absolutely awesome. God Bless this man .
Love it great story
Nice Chevy...great song too
This had me crying from the second verse.  Beautiful ❤️
Damner son🐾🐾 You 2 need to do more music together 🐾🐾 Beautiful harmony between you 2🐾🐾🐾💜💜
Awesome song and awesome performance!!!!
This is history 100 💯 bad a** song
Powerful best CMA performance
That was amazing
My number #1 song !! Hardy Is awesome!
Continues to give me chills - This is a powerful song.  A little scary, but powerful.
I actually don’t like this song at all. It promotes murder, vigilante behavior, manipulation, and making fun of mental illness. Clearly the guy that would throw his entire life away for a random woman that hangs out at a bar has a few screws loose and has a void to fill by becoming some strangers “hero” Than the woman manipulates this guy to go kill her boyfriend for her. Why do you guys at the CMA’s feel it is smart to promote such a dangerous and horrible song? Listen to the words, listen to the story. You guys and everyone that like this song are promoting and saying vigilantism is okay and encouraging people to go out and do this. Think about it. This song is trash!!!
Everytime I hear it I get goosebumps.
Man that was amazing 👏 I loved every second of it when watching it live! 😍
Song of the year
Love it more and more every time I listen to it!! Thanks hardy and Lainey!! From Montgomery al 🙏 ❤️
So much ❤ for this performance. It was amazing
Best country I have ever heard hardy you made a piece of  Beauty keep making great songs like this ❤
The first time I heard this song, it instantly became my favorite song ❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely 💯! This song is Amazing! And being A DV Survivor  it gives me Chills & gets me in my feels, you guys did this beyond perfectly 🥰 💞  thank you for this song/  means so much to so many! My fav. Song! Much love
That ass... omg 😲
Congratulations on your marriage and love your ssongs
Wow just wow
As always, awesome song!!!
I love this song and the performance was just as amazing as the video. I wish you would get the regintion that you so greatly deserve. You deserve every award.
My supervisor had us watching this at work. I love her, opened my eyes to some GREAT music 👌🏾
Awesome performance 👏
That's the best duet I've ever seen.
Best duet of the year. Hardy is the real deal.
Beyond  great....you rocked this out!!!!!👍✌️😎❤️
Amazing performance!!! Loved every second of it!! ❤
Not only a great song,but fantastic performance! I am so glad to see artists not afraid to put the real issues out there...BROVO HARDY AND LAINEY!
Man she got a CDL for that dump truck back there??
Performance of the night…..letssss gooooo
Dammit son now THAT IS COUNTRY!!! Keep it up, been waiting to hear something like you for a looooong time!
Great song
🔥🔥🔥
😂🤣😂 a complete failure of a song. Thus proves the dumbing down of man. This dude unnecessarily takes life in prison for retribution of a stranger. He could of done the deed and not went to prison but he wanted to wait on the steps? Litterly the dumbest man in the world. Pure hogwash
Can’t wait to see you in Athens and Atlanta!!!
Great performance Hardy! 💕
This is 🔥
Can't wait until part two of this song
Yea hardy we watch Morgan and you should of won we all now
Wasup boi’s
So good HARDY!
