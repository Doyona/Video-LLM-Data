So divine. so beautiful. such a goddess 💚
Does anyone know where she shops for her baby clothes?! I’ve been dying to know!
I absolutely love the way Sven is with you and how excited he was about the baby even before he held that little baby. You are one blessed family
I’m not crying-my allergies are just really bad 😭😭

Qui vient de la story Insta de Léna ? 🇨🇵🤣
Does anyone know where the baby clothes is from. From the beginning of the video?
Wow my heart goes out to anyone suffering from infertility. Don't even know how I was able yo have kids naturally. I have policistic ocarina síndrome, had two vagina surgeries, had to get biopsy because of polyp, etc. Had four kids with my husband.  If someone struggles there is something really bad with reproductive sistema. I feel upset for them, truly wish that anyone who wants a baby can have it and without problems. Good luck.
Yo te sigo hece rato , pero no sabia que estad embarazsda. Me alegro mucho por ustedes ,soy uno de muchos testigos de lo tanto que deseabas ser madre. Mis mas sinceros deseos de felicidad y prosperidad para tu familia Desi. Dios escucho tus oraciones mujer.mirate vas a tener un bebe que alegria. Dios los bendiga😊

In Mexico they say that you are supposed to take the baby  out of the hospital in Yellow for good luck and great health
Eagerly waiting for the next one! :D
This episode made me emotional!!
Steven is so supportive and loving! I see a lot of people want a Steven in their lives, and I feel so lucky I have my own awesome man in my life. ❤️   He’s the kind that kiss me and then my babybump, I can always talk to him about everything - even the gross stuff. He actually wants to know how I’m doing and truly cares about me and our little girl. 26+1 today! 🥰 97 days left! 👏🏼🎉  This year has been such a rollercoaster! Really big lows, but really big highs too!
i got my stretch marks after ive given birth 😂
Those 2pcs outfits are cute those will swallow a newborn.
u two are the sweetest, most deserving parents i’ve ever seen 🥺 created the perfect foundation of a life together, and now ur building a family off pure LOVE. very inspiring to me — pregnant with my first. thank u for these videos 💟
Tell me why this episode had me crying so much omg 🥺😩
Your shoot made me cry. So beautiful. I had a tiny little shoot with a friend and was scheduled for an actual one a few weeks after but I went into preterm labor and was never able to have my photos done. Cherish those forever , I'm sure you will!
So beautiful 💖☺️
18:14, you look like an absolute goddess! 🥰😩🥺😍

You guys are making such wonderful memories for your baby. He is going to be so lucky to be your son because you guys have been loving him for years and now you get to have what you have been waiting for the most!! God bless the Perkins!! 🥰🥰
I couldn't agree more, you definitely have to have a strawberry with every bite, otherwise it doesn't taste good. 🍓😊
I think he will look like Desi, in the scans he looks like he has her features 💕
I cried then I stopped then I cried again and then I  just fucken cried.
Desi, congrats! You’re such a beautiful mommy! You two are going to be such good parents! This journey is beautiful ❤️
I’ve been catching up on your journey, I’m almost caught up! Let me say, CONGRATULATIONS! You two are so cute, and have me crying by the end of each episode 🤣😭

I’m late to the party watching this one but OMG! didn’t plan to shed a tear, then I lost it when Desi wipes her tear away. Yes, very beautiful and magical!
Why am I crying watching this whole video omg I can’t 😫
nothing that can make you feel more alone—or stressed out—than trying to conceive. While you might have spent the better part of your youth doing all that you could to not get pregnant, when you're ready to build your family and the going gets tough, it's normal to have anxiety. Though TTC can feel exhausting, frustrating and lonely, the CDC estimates that more than ten percent of all couples will struggle with fertility—that's 1 in 10 partnerships.I want to thank God for putting a smile in my face, I have been looking for the fruit of the womb for the pass six years of marriage. I took in last year after taking the pill a dr gave to my husband, he met with a doctor you gave us assurance that I will get pregnant within a month after taking a particular pill. But I still call it magical pill, because it happen the way he said it. All thanks to God I have my own baby now and is a boy. You too can contact him if you have the same issue on doctoreddymon@gmail.com or call and WhatsApp him on +2348128107710. You can also reach me on WS973397@gmail.com for more information
I love you guys !!! Que dios lo bendiga siempre <33
It’s ok if you get stretch marks, you don’t have to explain to your fan base if you do have them !! You’re beautiful either way.
How beautiful Desi is, out of this world! ✨  Every women wants to find their Steven.  Amazing couple, I feel so emotional every time I watch their vlogs! It’s just me?! ❤️😅
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS!!! Personaly I don't know how it feels to go through what you did and I hope that you guys have a goergous healthy baby and I hope you guys have the best life toegther. Watching you and steven go through this journey really makes me wishful that there might be a nice guy our there like him who will stick through in all the hard times. Genuinely makes me so happy watching you guys come so far. You absolutely deserve the best baby mama! Can't wait for baby Perkin to come!!
Whenever desi says a dirty innuendo steven always laughs about it then moves on quickly cuz it makes him hot😂😂😂 like when they were in the car and she made the honeymoon joke and Steven laughed then turned his head Cuz he was embarrassed and then he grabbed her hand to hide the blush on his face was so hilarious! Such a cute couple😖🖤🖤🖤✨
Omg my baby girl had so much hiccups when I was pregnant with her 🥰 I miss that so much
Is this where you sell Perkins 6357 engine?
Steven has always given me gay vibes.
I was wondering if.you have an amazon wish list or a po box
The pure happiness that shows through each of your faces is heart warming.  I am so excited for you two to get to experience every miracle of being a parent.  Such deserving humans.
I'm gonna cry if you have him on my birthday!! 💕 Oct 16th!!! So happy for the two of you and your parenthood. You got this💕💕💕
Where can I purchase the baby outfits????
💝💖💕👪🙏👍👍🍫🍨🍧🍦🍭
I'm happy and on the verge of tears at the same time. Your family is so blessed and the fact that you have your family and friends' support is beyond beautiful. You're creating memories and most importantly you're creating life. I wish nothing but the best for you and through all the trials you go through you will be triumphant. Much love the the Perkins family <3
I have the same exact craving but I put Nutella over my strawberries 🍓 Yum!

Your belly is sooo beautiful :D
Idk why I get so emotional with this journey but I’m just so so so happy for you guys. I know it’s kind of crazy cuz I don’t know you two but still sending you and your growing family nothing but positivity love and health
Lmao @ Steven saying “we’re not ready” but also his imitation of Desi with the cast! Priceless! 💜
I feel like Katy might be preggers too.....or just really loving very loose clothing at the moment
Wow so divine 🥰😍😍😍
literally most stunning preggo person ever <3  btw can you give details of which air bnb this was in malibu please?!?!
I can’t wait for him to be here🥺
Been watching every video since I came across your channel. Especially when you announced your pregnancy but after losing our beautiful baby a little over a month ago it’s been hard to see your journey but today is the first time watching this video. You are so beautiful and I wish you, your hunny and your little bundle of joy so much happiness ♥️
Congratulations! In a Mexican tradition I heard bringing your baby home from the hospital is yellow attire for good luck. 😊 you'll be a Great Mama.
My firstborn was born a little over 9lbs and I had him at almost 41 weeks.. the last 2 weeks of pregnancy were miserable.  I felt so heavy and sluggish.. I thought I knew what tired was..until I had my son. Lol
Your relationship is so beautiful I’m over here crying at how adorable it is when Steven talks about you while you nap 😩
lolol take a shot every time desi makes you tear up.. instantly drunk 🥴
I love you guyssssss 😩😩😩😩
I'm just sitting here in awe!! This is so beautiful!!!!! You look absolutely amazing! I'm so happy for you both
So beautiful. Tears 😭❤️
Literally crying !!!! That shoot omg so beautiful!
That’s the ONLY way I eat my waffles girl!!! So funny that was my go to breakfast every morning when I was pregnant with my twins! Belgian waffles with strawberries and whipped cream 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I used pure cocoa butter, not sure where you’d get it in the USA. It literally melts into your skin and helps to keep the elasticity. I had no stretch marks and my baby was 9lbs. Beautiful shoot❤️
The montage of the baby shower made me SOOO emotional!💙
Every time I watch these videos my heart feels so full and warm! Thank you for sharing your beautiful truly magical real life moments it makes everyone so happy to see your family so happy!!! Infinite Blessing 💕💕💕💕
anyone know the song name?
My sister got stretch marks during delivery. If you can make sure bring your belly butter with you and have Steven put some on you before you start pushing.
What is the name of the song?? Does anybody knows ??
It’s not extra at all. Baby will pop right through those fits.
I didn’t do a maternity shoot with my first; my husband and I had only been together a few months and she ended up passing away. The way my husband looked at me in our maternity shoot with our rainbow is so amazing; maybe even better than our wedding day. We’ve been married 10 years on Friday and thank God our rainbow baby turned 8 on her daddy’s birthday in July. Our oldest would be turning 12 in March if she was still with us.
So happy for you 🥺😍
Stephen w the cast 😭😭😭😭
Yoooooo!!!! Before I saw you guys getting emotional!! 😢 I was already getting emotional!!! Lol 😂😂😂😂 😭😭 I’m so happy for you both!!! 💙
Steven is such a gentleman 🥺😭
Anyone know where the tie dye sweatsuit at 6:17 is from? She mentioned it on her stories before but I can’t remember 😣
What song do they use in the intro?
Why was the episode so emotional. I’m so happy for you both no one is more deserving than you two.   P.S. Tia is always the life of the party
When r u due
You look awesome 👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️
I had to pause this video just say I'm SO happy for you and that I'm not crying right now. 😭😭😭
these videos always make me soooooo emotional!
Aunt Katy! 🥰
Does anyone know where to get her necklaces?
I know this is cliche but at the shoot you were GLOWING! Angelic vibes allllll the way.
I’m not crying you’re crying 😭😭😭
I get so emotional watching this series. However the love that surrounds this baby is what we need right now.💙💙💙💙 blessings!
Was that a birthmark on your side/back? These videos always make me cry! The way your mom looked at you was so precious ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Steven holding the belly cast by the boobs🤣😂
My abuelita told my to bring my baby home in yellow !! 💛💛 I never really know the logic behind all her Hispanic suspicions, but I just go with it lol. She says it brings good luck home with baby 💛 I have been looking up to you for years as a Mexican-American, creative woman. So happy for you & can’t wait to look up to you as a fellow mother now too ✨
💜💜💜
Love you guys and hope everything is going well for you during this special time in your life and you look so gorgeous in this video and my thoughts and prayers are with you for a safe and healthy pregnancy and God bless you all and stay safe and healthy. Love 💘, guys so much ❤
Literally gorgeous, always.  I’m obsessed with those onesies. I literally found out I was pregnant so I’m so happy to see you lovin the belly butter.  Ugh I feel like I can feel the softness of the onesies!! It is almost time. I will just say I was one of the ones who had no stretch marks the whole time except BAM last month and they showed up randomly. Fingers crossed❤️
Those new born clothes look big
❤️❤️
This series has been so magical it brings me to tears watching every time. 😩 but ya’ll...her and Katie’s relationship?? 😩😩😩😩 I nearly lost it at the end when they hugged. So precious.
It’s so cute just seeing both of your love, Steven is so inlove with you!  I wish I could’ve got to experience that type of look with my baby’s father. I have faith that there’s more guys like Steven and hope one day I could meet one like him. I’m so happy for you guys!
I’m crying so hard right now 🥺😭 you’re so beautiful Desi ! I’m so happy for you all 🥺🥺🤍🤍
Some time in the last few weeks of pregnancy I got stretch marks in between my thighs!!!! so make sure you are massaging that stretch mark stuff in between your thighs. I also have stretch marks on my ass but I don’t really care about those. But the ones in between my thighs I am so self conscious about.
18:44 GIRLLLL this song is a HIT!! Song is (King Sis- Hiatus)
So we already know that Desi is a literal QUEEN, but can we all take a moment to appreciate Steven?! He is the sweetest, most supportive zaddy in ALL the land!!!!! God bless you both & yalls beautiful family!! ❤🥺❤
When you hear your baby boy cry for the first time, it will be the most memorable day of your life.
Everytime you cry I cry bc I know how long you two have waited for this and it just makes my heart so happy that you get to experience this beautiful journey.
Everyones talking about the photoshoot, but my favorite part was Steven doing your belly cast. He was so focused and loving.
This is so beautiful, having watched your entire journey since these episodes began has been amazing. I definitely shed a tear in this episode! You two are so deserving!!! Congratulations Perkins Family!
Beyond excited for you!!! I look forward to the videos!! Love you guys!!!! So Inspirational ❤️
When Steven walked in fast with the baby belly lmaoooio I couldn't stop laughing
I sobbed during the photoshoot anyone else?!?!? Like WHAT R U KIDDING ME SHES SO BEAUTIFUL
I have 3 kids, PACK EXTRA! Baby clothes and clothes for you Desi!
While I was giving birth during the peak of the pandemic, my husband kept calling me a goddess during the entire process. This photoshoot made me cry! Beautiful, Desi ♥️
I teared up watching your mom watch you during the photo shoot.. such a special moment! And the hug you and Katy had at the shower.. you can feel and see the love! So happy for you and Steven🤍
Baby Perkins saving 2020🥰
goddddd dam, i cried like a baby when you was having your maternity shoot done. SO BEAUTIFUL.  I can only imagine the excitement of your baby coming and the way you have documented the whole journey, your child is incredibly lucky to be able to watch these back. I can't wait to do something like this for myself and child when i have a baby in the future
Steven and Desi I honestly cry more and more with every new episode through your fertility journey. I went through my own struggles and had my miracle baby 12 years ago but unfortunately lost 2 babies after that and at 31 years old had to have a total hysterectomy. I’m 36 years old and wish I could have had more babies. Watching your story reminds me of my struggle and how grateful I am to have my handsome miracle (not so much a baby anymore but my baby forever) baby and the gift of being able to be a mommy every single day. I literally cry remembering how much I went through and how hard the struggle is when you want something more than anything in the world. I wish you both and your bundle of miracle joy all the happiness in the world and the true gift and blessings of parenthood it is like nothing else you will ever experience in life may god bless you all and I can’t wait to see your beautiful baby when he is born. Oh and the best part is my sister is actually only a couple weeks ahead of you and is having my first nephew. Congratulations to you and your family I truly commend you for sharing such an amazing story that so many women face every day in silence. So here’s to the struggle for women who suffer from fertility issues and the true blessing of the babies that are helped to make parents like us parents at all. 🎉🎉🎉🎁🎁🎁💙💙💙
Ya’ll are too cute! The love that you two have for each other is so beautiful! 💕
When I was pregnant my sons hiccups felt like drops of rain inside my belly
Just imagine this is probably the last “staycation” with just the two of them 😭🥰
I FUCKING LOVE THIER SMILES OMG .. Stevens smile is so fucking pure ... I love you frienddddss blessyouuuuu💜💜🥺🥺🥺💜💜💜💜
every single episode makes me so emotional 🥺 I love you so so much desi, I’m so happy for you, steven, and your whole family!!! you guys deserve all the best things in life <3 praying for you and your health always!!
Baby's first outfit should be yellow for good luck 💛
You guys 😍 can't stand how cute they are together 😭 you two deserce all good in the world.

❤️❤️❤️ I love you two!!!! So happy and excited!!!!! You are my joy during this time.  ❤️
I totally agree with Sven, there were 2 beautiful silhouettes in that painting aka happy little accident as Mr Ross would say ❤️ what a beautiful thing for your babe to grow up with! I loved Nicholas for a boy, with Nico as the nickname, but I got 3 girls so it’s up for grabs 😂😂❤️❤️❤️
I saw you guys in the watercolor before Steven said anything! <3

I think "Art " is going to be baby Perkin's name ❤
You guys always give the GOOD VIBES!  Love ya!
I can’t wait to see Steven as a dad, he’s going to set the bar SO HIGH for the rest of us watching from home 😭
I wonder if his name will be Tuscan or like Tuscany 😭 keep the theme going ❤️
This is so beautiful! I’m so happy for you guys ❤️🥺
OMG I verbally screamed when Sven came around the corner with your cast!! 😅😅
i smiled the whole video.... v i b e s
I can’t wait to experience beautiful moments like this I’m soooo happy for the both of you so happy that you have given us all this experience to share with you 🤍
My crying love this !!!!
That’s going to be one good looking baby 🤗
That's the belly cream I used when pregnant with my son! Also used it in conjunction with silky skin custard pregnancy cream, seriously I swear by them.  Also a good tip to keep in mind is keep applying it even after you give birth while your stomach is shrinking back down, it helps it to not sag, I had not a single stretch mark or sagginess to my skin, even though people told me "if your mom had stretch marks you will too" im currently 23 weeks with my 2nd and am using both creams and no stretch marks so far:)
I legit cry at all of these. I'm so excited to see you guys become parents💖
😍
I’m crying and I have chills wow I’m so happy for you 🥺🥺🥺😩😩😩
Why do I cry every episode 😭 Desi like I always say your truly beautiful and meant to be a mommy, that boy will forever be lucky 💛💛💛
Every one of these episodes make me tear up Man!
I want to be this happy ❤️ a joy to watch
Desi you looked absolutely stunning in the shoot!! The pictures and footage was so beautiful 💫... Steven did such a good job with the cast aswell!! Every video you guys have me sheading tears 😭💙 your journey is so beautiful to see!

I can't believe how far along you are already!! Your pregnancy flew by 😍🥺 this whole journey is so beautiful and unique, I'm so proud and excited for you two! I can't wait to see baby P 🤭
Steven is hilarious, can’t wait to meet him, whenever your ready to share him don’t feel rushed

🥺💓💓❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽
The way Steven talks about Desi and the baby is the cutest thing ever, makes me so emotional 😭😭
Those baby clothes look huge for a new born 😂
The way Steven looks at youuuu 🥺😭❤️
Stretch marks. I didn’t have any until after I gave birth and they are still there 😑😑 thankfully it’s on my “love handles” 😂 so you can’t really tell.

Fun fact: Your nostrils work one at a time

The tears never stop. I have been watching you both since I was 14; you and Kathleen were the first women I subscribed to when I began watching. This journey your filming is so beautiful and I’ve never been so happy for a couple. I truly feel like I’m going through this with you all! It’s like we’re all best friends here. 🥺❤️
We dont need another one of these shows on YouTube
Congrats
Что это за трэш умственно отсталый, почему не сделали отливку говна беременной тёти из гипса ?
Just a PS., those clothes are way too big lol
Sometimes the easiest part is before a child is born, cause when they start to walk and then get in their terrible 2's the real work begins.  Nice Journey, thank you for sharing.  At Amazon-..please stay safe https://tinyurl.com/y4wp79x3
Omg Desi at 5:57 that look at the camera. Just ughhhh. Sigh. I have never seen anyone look more like an angel in my whole life then in that moment. The water swelled in my eyes the butterflies bounced in my stomach. Knowing your story. Just wow Desi. I felt nothing but LOVE in that moment. I just had to replay it, then replay it. My heart felt so full in that moment. I bursted with tears of happiness for you and Steven.  🥺😭😭😭😭🥰🥰
The hiccups were the best feeling during my pregnancy 😍
Ack!!! You should be staying home or practicing safe social distancing and everyone around you should be wearing masks. We’re in the middle of a pandemic and pregnant women are at a higher risk of getting covid cause of the lower immune system!
Nice rack
the clip when Steven is applying the belly cast on you....TEARS!!!!!
Why would someone press on 'dislike'? What is wrong with people?   Amazing guys good luck and have a great start of your life❤❤👑👑

So much darkness in the world, and here you are Desi a big gleam of light. Thank you for letting us in. I don't think you understand how much joy these videos bring to everyone. Just beautiful. God bless
Can you or anyone tell me the name of the instrumental music at the beginning of her photo shoot?? Please!!
I’m sure it’s still unreal to you waking up and seeing ur belly grow!! I can’t wait for little baby Perkins to be here!! Y’all are going to be amazing parents! ❤️
Catching up thanks to school but anyway I literally cry every time I watch one of your videos!! So beautiful! It just gets better every video!! So incredibly happy for you both so much!!!❤️
I’m confused about the “girls” lol what’s that? Who’s the girls?
Such a beautiful vlog! But yes I see you two in the water color painting,  your top knot and everything lol 😂💛
Every time I get a notification for a new episode my face goes : 🥺🥺🥺
Hi Desi, congratulations by the way!!!😘 And if you didn't get stretch marks yet, you're not going to get them at all. That's just my opinion. I know that everyone's body is not the same but I gave birth to two baby girls and no stretch marks for either child. I had 6 pound babies, so I would like to say I wasn't big at all. You are carrying beautiful!♡ keep buttering up that tummy and you'll be fine😄❤
Love 💕 tears 😭
I’m constantly just so thankful for your baby. It’s the highlight of my 2020.
HELLO EVERYONE AFTER USING DOCTOR OYAMA HERBS I GOT PREGNANT I WAS FACING INFERTILITY AND FERTILITY JOURNEY BUT Dr OYAMA HERBS MAKE ME SMILE AGAIN  I want to use this medium to thank Dr  oyama for helping me  cure fertility through his herbs .i was childless for 10 years and I have tried different doctors with surgery but they were all in vain ,a friend of mine introduce me to  about herbal cure I decided to give it a try to it. i contacted him and explained my situation to him, he prepared the herbal medicine and sent it to me. he instructed me on how to use it and to my greatest surprise after using the fertility herbs for just 21 days I notice some changes in me and so I decided to visit the hospital and my doctor confirm that I was pregnant, today I am a happy mother of my own child. thank God for everything for sending Dr  oyama to me you can contact him via email droyamasolutiontemple@gmail.com or WhatsApp +2348108264684 His Page  @Oyamaherbs

Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures   If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.

living my dream 🥺 we’re pretty close in due date (mine is oct 30th) also a first time mom to a boy and i’m absolutely at the “sloth” stage too. all I want to do is sleep and eat but I can’t stop working until it’s literally go time 😭 ran out of PTO so I can’t afford to take weeks off pre baby, but I’m so thankful I do have 10 weeks of maternity leave paid but still makes me sad lol anyway, so happy that I got to experience my pregnancy with someone even though it was through a screen because it literally feels that like we met. can’t wait till our boys are here 🤍
This is so sweet! Wish I had been able to make a casting of my belly during both of my pregnancies! I'm so very happy for you both!! Sending love, light & good, positive vibes to you both & to your families!! & To everyone else out there!! 💛💜✨🌒🌕🌘✨💜💛🤜🤛
Mom jokes have a lot of attitude and taking low-key shots at the person you're talking to (your husband)
omg desi this is so gorgeous and i cannot wait til we meet him <3
Tearing up during the photoshoot so beautiful you guys deserve it all 💕
😍😍😍😍😍
It's me again I got a IDs and I'm I'm really signing off this time car Harris is unbelievably beautiful I just noticed it and actually she's beautiful how did it get to be so lucky to get somebody that pray because he's not that damn good-looking honey I got three grandsons are probably his age yeah you could have done better you must have you must really love him LOL I'm gone
I'm 75 years old I have 13 great-grandchildren another one is on the way and I'm sitting here talking babies you know something seriously is wrong with me don't you because I'm sitting here talking about babies I guess cuz I love him so right now anyway most of my great grandkids are between the ages of 5 and 8 the age of what you want to choke them but you know what here's the deal I can cut them on and off when I want to I don't have to deal with it I give them the toys that drives their parents crazy I give them anything that will drive them other than dead in crazy you talk about Sweet Revenge oh Lord yes I get my kicks one of my daughter she said you were out to sabotage me out that I don't know what you're talkin about lol I'm off of this hey y'all don't know how I got here hey congrats
I was born August 26th you want to have a Virgo baby I have granddaughter and I have a niece that went into labor on my birthday and have the baby the next day on the 27th do you think I was pleased about that no no no I just knew that they was going to be born on my day but it didn't happen
Beautiful beautiful outfits I had two daughters looking back I think I change my girls maybe four times a day and shame on me because I was so OCD and everything just had to be perfect because of someone happened to stop by my kids had to be just perfect I would not accept nothing less they say you get over it with your first work while no I never did all my children had to be to perfection yeah I guess I was a little screwed up in the head but feeling that way and guess what I'm still at work I'm still as they do I'm 75 and I think I do quite well
I'm so sorry that I think every woman on this Earth when she becomes pregnant if she takes a journey as well did you think that's it you should kudos
Love your videos so much can’t wait for when the baby is here!!

I just cry the entire video.... I’m just so happy for you two... absolute rockstar parents 🤍🧡💜💛
this journey is so beautiful! it’s something small that keeps me going everyday when things get tough this is something i look forward to one day
Sorry girl but why on earth would you risk your lives by having a party? Also please stop bragging endlessly about your boobs. You wanted implants, so don’t complain.
What is this exact song becauseeeeeee.... I NEED IT!!!
Ii don't know if you are already planning on it but it would be better to wash the baby clothes before you put it on the baby, with special baby soap other wise it could irritate his skin...im only saying this cuz i noticed that all the clothes had the tags still on, and i don't know if you were preparing the hospital bag...but anyways, you look gorgeous and I wish you all the best!!!!
Im living this pregnancy like I would be mine 😭😍 I can't waittttt
When you both just looking into each other eyes that got me 😭
My stretchmarks literally appeared overnight at 37 weeks...I bought everything!!! And used everything!!! i was on a ritual and still got them.😑
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SERIES ON YOUTUBE💙 BABY PERKINS IS ALREADY SO SO LOVED💙
It would have looked so cute if she never had gotten her fake boobs. They are not cute at all. Looks so abnornal.
Your happiness is beaming, both you and Steven. It's so beautiful to watch and makes me so excited for the day I get to experience this!! I can't wait for you to reveal baby in just a few shorts weeks <3
❤ 🤰
Just her e to tell YouTube don't ever spoke this garbage on my recommended again. Thanks.
My face is on permanent smile when watching these videos. They are so beautiful and pure. I don’t even know how to express how happy I am for you two. It’s getting so close!
I loved this so much! ❤️😭
No one else thinks this is gross? Or sees any problems with this?
Like a wise man once sayed BIG TITS IN THE THUMB NAIL BIGGER TITS BIGGER VIEWS

Damn how about the drone footage in Malibu!! that was awesome, can already imagine Sven in the delivery room camera ready
This is incredibly beautiful!!! Thank you!!!🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️
Watch the uncut video https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nyNiZpQ8CZeyYaEEB_z6FyYDb773Uko28
Yuppp I got my stretch marks a month before my daughter was born but something that really helped me was rose hip oil you can barely see the ones I got 🙏🏻❤️
LMAO
Whenever I think desi can’t get more stunning she one ups herself. She’s a truly beautiful soul and body
Every time I watch your guys’ videos it makes me want to cry because I just miss being pregnant so bad 😭😭 & your journey is just so beautiful!! The blessings just keep pouring ❤️❤️❤️
SOO much love and happiness in those vlogs. You guys deserve this soso much. Love it ♥️♥️♥️ Got teary eyed throughout the whole thing
I love this series so much I pray to find someone who looks at me the way Steven looks at Desi. It’s absolutely magical.
not me boohoo crying rn
Watching the clips from your photoshoot is so angelic and sweet. Something that you have prayed for so long has truly come to fruition. God is so good. Woman are truly a co-creator with God as a child is growing in her.  You are such a beautiful mom.
They are one of the couples who deserved to be parents, I'm so pleased that they will soon have their baby in their arms, this Fertility journey is being the most beautiful thing ever ❤️😘
I died out of emotion!! I love both of you so much

Congratulations 👏
Watch "Nova surprise baby... is it a Boy or Girl?? (MUST WATCH)" on YouTube https://youtu.be/9ZXIur7XLws
Literally so beautiful! I cry with every single video 🥺💖
We just started our gofundme to help with our miracle baby ✨🙏🏼 if anyone would like to help here is our story & link https://www.gofundme.com/f/3w9k4q-ivf-procedure?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1
So so gorgeous!!!❤️ and about the stretch-marks I didn’t get any my whole pregnancy and I was using organic Shea butter! But I didn’t keep up right after delivery because I had a c section and I ended getting a few because of the body going back so fast! So make sure you do it non stop!❤️😘
how adorable are you two!!!!!!!! ❤💕
So beautiful to witness all of this and be with you guys along this journey 🥺 so happy for you guys ✨🤍🙏🏼
Yesshh I saw it in the paintingg😍😍the beautyyyy
I cried. Cried, cried, cried... you two are so perfect for eachother. I will miss this series. Can’t wait to watch you both blossom into beautiful parents ❤️
"Your confidence was so beautiful to see." brb while I go cry... 🥺
So beautiful, I'm so happy for you and I love your elephant drawing. Your artistic abilities are amazing <3
This kinda shit is fucking disgusting. So many out there can't have kids and these assholes try to profit from it like a pet they bought just to turn into a YouTube star. People like these two need to die from horrific accidents and hopefully when they are judged in the after life they can burn there to.... no seriously fuck these disgusting people and that baby I hope comes out as retarded as their father. Even if these douchebags are wealthy it dont mean they will be bright enough for the hopefully failures of children to stay rich on.
THE MOST AWAITED BABY ARRIVAL EVER!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The maternity pictures are so beautiful!!
My family believes yellow is good luck for newborns !!! When they get out of the hospital.
I love u guys😍
I’m crying
Im already getting teary eyed thinking about the love & joy you both will experience the moment Baby Perkins is born and in your arms! 💜
💜💜💜

This episode was so beautiful. I cant get enough.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I’m so happy for you guys!!
I can't watch this vedo without 😢 in my eyes.. I just hope one day that will be me.  So happy for you..
I’ve never seen a man so in love with his pregnant wife like Steven 🥺💙 the way he talks about her and LOOKS like her. wow wow wow 🥺
What Airbnb did you stay in? 🥺
One piece https://youtu.be/_tLc9IUvO8Y
Damn them bitches hang
Steven is going to be the most amazing support system for you during labor and when you guys bring your sweet boy home. 💙 Wishing you nothing but happiness coming into motherhood 💙
Steven you're the best.  Cant eait for me and my husband to go through this!!!
So kids, if you wanna sexualize your pregnancy, do what they do. Now get out there and make it gross!
Steven is so artsy!
The way you guys have documented this journey is unreal and the fact that you included us is just so special. I'll always support you and whatever you put out! Love and blessings to you guys Perkins family!!
Congrats guys. I’m so happy for your family and so excited to continue these episodes/vlogs. Count down to meet baby boy.
Watch from 14:38. I know what you're here for. P.S. That cast looks really good!
Wow... that gave me chills
I'm not crying you are!
Biden
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy_4lk9EAMuwIPe55nIR5mw Did you Subscribe to my channel 🥰❤️
Girl you still pregnant?! :-D Lol!
My favorite part of these videos is just the way Steven does everything he can to make sure that Desi gets everything she wants and needs to make her pregnancy the best it can be without smothering and its just really beautiful to watch. Grateful that there are men like Steven out there.
I’m not crying, you are 🥺🥺🥺🥺
click baited by beautiful body
Pregnancy looks amazing on you! 💕
The ending had me in tears 😭🥺 I can’t wait for BABY P to come already!!!
Yall are too cute. I can't think of a more deserving couple.
Didn’t get stretch marks until the last 2 weeks before I delivered. I have this theory that if you don’t have any and then you get them before delivery you’re baby is 8lbs +. As a labor nurse I have yet to be proven wrong.
Steven on hair duty while Desi pees!🤣👏🏼💖
Song towards the end?
The mold goes over the belly to show how big it got. Now the boobs and soon the wap
You look stunning a tip from me with 3 pregnancies I used rosehip oil and I didn't get any stretch marks. 2nd tip would be continue using creams or oil after pregnancy for a couple more months. Xoxo
You people are doing good, best of luck to new Commer in the world
🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
Desi omg you really found the perfect man! You two are literally the perfect couple!
You know when your just so happy for someone.. that's me for you desi.❤
I strive to find a women as beautiful as desi one day!!!

i love how attentive you both are with eachother even the little things like desi asking "how do you feel babe" after she's just shared her own personal thoughts and feelings. the care you both have for each other translates through the screen beautifully. God bless
I got so teary eyed. Perfect family.
be honest everyone clicked for the  milk bags
Steven trying on the belly cast LMAO!!! This video had me feeling a lot. So happy for you all, your love is so beautiful, your baby is so blessed!
WE NEED MORE STEVENS IN THIS WORLD WOW
It’s possible to avoid stretch marks I didn’t really get any in my first pregnancy maybe like one tiny non noticeable one and in my second I didn’t take care of my skin and I got them 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Sobbing listening to Steven talk about Desi's confidence
Aww man I got stretch marks 2 weeks before I gave birth, but not the end of the world! 💕sending much love to you Desi!

Omg Desi 😲!!! That is the most beautiful cast I've seen on a pregnant belly GOOD JOB STEVEN!!! GIRL I HAVE 5 kids and don't have 1 stretch mark... and I went right back into my size right after I had all them oh did I mention my smallest baby was 7.2 lbs and the rest of them were like 7.7 7.11 and 8. 5 lbs. You got this love the only thing I used was baby oil with aloe vera 😁😁 im getting so excited for you both.. God bless you and your growing family..💋😷💋🤭💋😷please stay safe..
i live for every fertility video you post. the amount of love and support that baby is going to have. makes me melt.<3
Looove the photo shoot you guys did. ❤️You are gonna be so happy and grateful later on you did it while pregnant. I wish I did too... Best of luck guys. Few more weeks 😱
The way Steven looks at desi 😫🥰 I mean my god this man just loves her so much he can’t even hide it! So beautiful
Such beautiful memories you will have to look back on. You are beautiful xx
What is the name of the song playing during the baby shower?!
no idea why im crying?!?! but I am!!
I love watching this series. So precious ❤️
Girl you need to LATHER your entire body in lotions,body butters, oils etc. Not just your belly. You can get stretch marks on your arms, legs, butt, boobs, neck etc. You could get no stretch mark on your stomach but you can get them elsewhere.
What was her other cream for stretch marks, I can’t remember?
Your life is amazing Desi. You are very blessed ❤
Made me cry. You are a true goddess. God bless you and your family 🥰🥰❤❤❤ so truly happy for you.
You are blooming and it suits you perfectly. 😍
STEVEN CRYING........... WOW. stop. That got me.
You are so beautiful. The photoshoot made me cry!
I always lubed up and one day woke up looking like a road atlas....i was like cool. Thanks dude.....haha but you know what i worked hard for that baby and no shame in my marks.
This is the first video I cried to since one of the beginning ones. It’s the home stretch! Genuinely so happy for you guys! Can’t wait to see the baby once he is here 💙
Omg loooving these!!! And Desi your artistic abilities are STUNNING!!! And you're one of the most beautiful couples I've ever seen...besides my own of course. Ive never been so invested in a baby besides my own 2 ❤❤
I’m so in love with this whole journey🥺
Also the elephant that you got, those Jellycat toys are amazing, I love them so much - I’ve bought about 20 of them for my son and he’s only 5 months old 😂
Joons is so sneaky 😂
Eeeekkk!!!  Need a makeup tutorial for 4:30 / the photo shoot!  🥰  Also, your smiles at 5:55.  😭😍
Her joy is so beautiful!!
Normally when people announce their pregnancy late, it seems like the baby comes so fast after that. With desi it seems like she’s been pregnant FOREVER😂😂😂😂I know she’s loving though and she looks so beautiful! ❤️❤️❤️❤️✨❤️❤️✨
I literally feel like my best friend is pregnant and I'm going to be so sad when I can't hold him
I thought I got so lucky because I didn’t have any stretch marks during pregnancy, but then they came after 😭 but it’s okay, they’ve faded a lot and aren’t bad at all
Literally sobbing because this is so beautiful ♥️
God bless! You guys have left me in tears again... Love!!! 🙏🕊️❤️
The baby's name has something to do with a Saffari! I hope I am right😂 send me makeup if it is true lol
❤️❤️❤️
I must say you have to be the most beautiful pregnant 🤰 woman I’ve ever seen and the both of you together are just beautiful 😍 God bless you Desi and Steven it’s magical to see you both through this journey and having this beautiful moment.. Congratulations 🍾🎉🎊🎈 again

Desi is glowing with this pregnancy so beautiful!!!! 😻
You guys are so special, Love you
Steven: she's getting them inches  🤣🤣🤣
Girl I understand Stevens fear of the stairs, when I was looking at houses (mind you I’m not even preggo or have kids) but was completely terrified of them because of the fear when pregnant or with child that I would fall 🤷🏼‍♀️😭
I cry when I watch your videos. I’m so happy for you both!❤️
Desi singing the lion king song for the pain LOL, <3
You got to stop with these vlogs. My ovaries can't take it 😭 You guys are so sweet, what a lucky baby he is already 💙
I was 31+5 with my 5th baby eeeek x
Desi!!!! Your belly is so perfect, I didnt get stretch marks either til I gave birth, I literally watch them form 1 by 1 right after my son came out. Coconut oil helped them fade!!!
I have to find a man that is looking at me in the same way that Steven is looking at you! 😍
Your videos are literally so majestic. I literally tear up in every single video you post on your journey. I’m so incredibly happy for you and your family ❤️
My baby name guesses are - Africa or Safari :)
Hola Desi! Loved this video just like all of your other fertility videos. Where can I find me a Steven? Que hermoso es el amor que ustedes tienen. It's refreshing to see a marriage that loves/support each other. Can't wait to see baby Perkins. :)
The babymoon was so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
This was so beautiful
OMG Desi elephant is AMAZING!!!!!
Every time I get so emotional when I watch this series. I am 19 weeks pregnant with my first child. I hope that I will get so confident in my bids like you as well. You are the most beautiful pregnant woman I have seen. Honestly. And Steve will be the best father. For sure. I wish you all the best and many greetings from Germany 🇩🇪
Getting so close now! Can't wait to see him when he arrives!
I love you guys so much it’s always the happiest moments with you guys.. he is gonna be the happiest most loved baby boy ever 😭😭
steven: “got my girls in the truck... i could never say that on a normal day!”  him in “the girls” shirt 10 mins later: 👁👄👁
why was you taking the stuffed elephant out of the bag and saying elephante the cutest thing i’ve ever seen
i love that your family is always helping with your milestones!!! they obviously know how much these things mean to you and its so clear how much you mean to them!!!!!!! its all so sweet to see, thanks for sharing <3
I laugh and cry in every episode. So well produced and put together I love it. You look gorgeous. My youngest had hiccups every time I went to lay down. I would have to stand and sway to get him to stop. Weirdest feeling!! Congrats you two💚 #boymom
The photo shoot is so disgusting and fake. I didn't like it. 😒 And the cast 🤦🏻‍♀️ ppl are so extra in a disgusting way.
AAAWWWW DESI 💖
Perfect people <3
Beautiful x
Steven is the best. Desi, you are blessed beyond measure. And you deserve every bit and more. Love you Perkins family. 💗
A baby shower during a global pandemic? No one wearing a mask. Are you not afraid of COVID? I just can't comprehend why someone would do that, especially when you had such a hard time to concieve and then risk it all because of a baby shower? Just why?
So adorable.  I cry at least once with every video you two make♡ such a beautiful life right? Very blessed 🙌
I felt so emotional near the end with all your friends and loved ones celebrating this baby. Especially the scene with Katy... imma stop here before I burst into tears

I honestly cried seeing the shoot 🥺 this was such a beautiful and pure moment 💗  blessings towards your future family
I never got stretch marks so maybe you might not get
I always tell my self am not going to watch any of your fertility journey because the emotion I feel are unbelievable! So freaken overwhelmed for you and can not wait to see him!!! May you have a fast and safe delivery ♥️♥️
Aughh this vlog got me emotional 😭😭😭😭
It’s so beautiful to see how much you are treasuring you’re pregnancy Desi and capturing these beautiful moments! I’m so filled with joy 🙌🏾🧡🧡
Wow you look so beautiful! Speechless! I wish I did a maternity photoshop before I had my babygirl, being in the military sometimes makes it so hard to do anything but I glad I was able to go back home to Cali to have my baby with my family.
One tip for the birth: short nails! During  delivery i was grabbing my husbands arm so tight I really hurt him with the long nails and also with the baby at the beginning it is safer and more comfy with shorter nails. Btw: Have you thought about cloth diapering? In eastern europe it is really common. You have almost Zero waste, but need to wash. With a dryer at home it's really now hassle. There are really modern Systems nowadays. We use Milovia and Xkko.
Honestly ya’ll are so freaking cute. I CANNOT DEAL
I just want to cry with every fertility episode! That photo shoot was so ethereal and magical :')
STUNNING!! ✨
I so disliked baby hiccups 😩 my baby had them always I swear I’d be like not again lol but it’s a good thing 😂. Desi you have no idea what your in for good luck but luckily u have your mom and aunt cause u guys are going to be so tired. Life isn’t going to be your life it’s going to be the babies life u just live in it.
Please don’t be a boring ass name. I really hope it’s unique
Did anyone else bawl their eyes out at the maternity shoot 😭❤
I can’t help but watch this whole series with the biggest smile on my face & a warm heart. You guys are amazing, and the video production is literally always so bomb & gives me the feels 😂🥰
Labor pain is no joke!!! But oh my goodness the precious little sweetheart I have next to me definitely makes it so worth it!!. Becoming a mother has giving me a confidence I didn't know I had. Becoming a mother has made me realized I could do anything in this world. God has given me the gift of life!! And that I will never take for granted🙏🥰 I wish you nothing but good vibes in your coming labor and delivery Desi! 😍
Currently, 7minutes in and it’s 3:25am and I’m balling😭 Desi you really are a Goddess. The way Steven expresses your beauty and seeing your mom’s face while you’re doing your shoot😩❤️ I am so incredibly happy for you guys, you have no idea how happy you make my heart with this whole journey. My baby is 3 months old now and seeing you pregnant makes me want another😁
Desi and Steven, you both deserve to cherish this whole first pregnancy experience. I love seeing you both embracing it and making every moment memorable. I wish you a safe and smooth delivery, Desi. I can't wait to watch Perkins family vlogs.
Wow I started crying at the beginning of your photo shoot because you made me think of my FAVORITE statue..The Winged Victory of Samothrace     so much power
I'm so happy for u guys 🙏💕, I teared up when Desi started crying during the shoot. God bless u guys🙏💕
I’m really out here watching Desi live my dream

Wow Desi! You look so beautiful!❤🙏
I abso LOVE this series.  Without even knowing you guys personally (I feel like I do 🥰)...I know you guys will be the best parents. I love how you enjoy every minute of your pregnancy, you’re beautiful Desi!
Hi Desi :) With my first ,, i got the most horrendous stretch marks toward the ended of my pregnancy .. ( I was very young and have olive skin) I was told by a dear old Aunty that the less elastin  you have naturally in the skin (genetics) that the more likely u are to "tear/stretch" the skin because it doesn't have as much "give" .. fairer skinned folk have the easiest it seems and darker skin has less .. hence why they seem to age slower .. reduced elasticity :) It's a little more complicated that than that I am sure .. but that's my very basic understanding..
Love the water color paintings! 😍
You are stunning! 💛💛💛
Wish you the best on this chapter you're about to encounter with your blessing. 💙
Such a beautiful video beginning to end ❤️
I cried 😭, this journey is so beautiful. Thank you for sharing your story.
YOU GUYS ARE  GONNA BE THE MOST AMAZING PARENTS EVER YOUR SON IS SO LUCKY TO CALL YOU MOM AND DAD
😭❤️ your maternity shoot,..ugh 💯😍 you are stunning and it is such a beautiful thing to carry a baby and you are gorgeous!!
6:25 - 6:50 The way he speaks about her 😭😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  Edit:  But Forreal it’s all the ways he speaks about her and celebrate her 😭 I hope to have a love like this one day.
This is like your favorite Netflix series.. waiting for the next season to come up 😭😭😭😭 more vídeos please ! Lol
I thought a “staycation” was when you “stay” at home for your “vacation”??? Am I wrong?
“I love the staircase even tho Steven doesn’t let me go up and down by myself” as he should ❤️☺️
I pray I find a love like what you and Steven have one day. Blessings to you and your family 💕

I didn’t have stretch marks until the last week. 😩 it was 2-4 tiny baby ones on my stomach and I was like “oh ok not bad”. After I had her when my stomach deflated they were horrible. I was in complete shock. I love them now but I really wasn’t expecting that to happen. 😬
Where is her baby shower dress from?! 😍
why i am absolutely sobbing right now. so beautiful.
Omg I’m dying for a video of when Ariel does your makeup
UGH IM CRYING
I don’t know if you’ll read this Desi or Steven. But buy the book - I Wish You More By Amy Krouse Rosenthal. ❤️ Any one who reads this buy this book to give as a gift its the cutest.
OMG SO EXCITED!!!
Lol anyone else think she was about to pose with the Mcdonalds?

Anyone else see beauty and the beast in the water color painting??
Just wanted to say again how precious you all have been through this whole beautiful process. Thank you for sharing this part of ur lives with us.
I actually recommend buying more bigger size clothes for the kiddo. They run through the small sizes sooooo fast! And because the tiny clothes r so cute, everyone tends to buy u more of the small clothes (baby shower) your series is so beautiful and the editing is *chef’s kiss* im so excited for the bay-bay!!! He’s almost here! 😆 lmao i was not expecting steven to come out with ur cast on! 🤣🤣

18:23 Steve’s face all blushed up is just wonderful... I love they both are so in love with each other, makes me jealous I don’t have anyone to have a baby with...

The documentary has been been so amazing, emotional, lovely, just everything!!😭❤❤
your visions for photos and videos are out of this world! here we go crying again 😭💖
I got tiny stretch marks by my belly button on my 41 week mark. I went to 41 weeks and a day.  But i got stretch marks on my breast (which made me cry cause i didn’t know that would happen 😂😂 pregnancy hormones are REAL) and on my thighs! But not terrible.
I can’t wait to be in a healthy relationship like Desi and Steven🤍 can’t wait to have my own family
When your son is older, it’s amazing that you can look back at these video. My daughter is a toddler now and I look at videos of her moving in my belly or her ultrasounds and I’m always in awe.

Desi, I just want to let you know that I had a dream a few weeks ago that your baby would be named Pharaoh. I don’t know why, but I just had a feeling and want to put it out there!
This genuinely makes me so happy 🤍 can’t wait for baby boy to pop🦋🦋🦋
He will be able to look back on these videos, and see how much he was wanted and loved. Beautiful.

Pregnancy looks beautiful on you two. So happy and blessed for your guys.
I love the last song who sing it ?
I am obsessed with u guys, i love this, i am watching all the while having contractions, i am due on the 29th, but i think my lil boy is coming sooner than we thought.
my guess is that baby's name is Journey @staticjon
I used all sorts of lotions and oils too, but  didn’t get stretch marks till literally after giving birth ! tiger stripes mama 🐯 you learn to love them 💕and my second baby , I didn’t even bother with lotion and oils on the belly.  Your birth story is going to be incredible 🥰🤗 (#chapstick for your hospital bag! )
When Stephen came out in the belly cast 😂😂😂😂😂
desi and steven are one of those couples that just deserves to bring a child into this world. like you know the child will grow up with the best morals and the most loving home and it makes me so happy they're finally having a baby like they've always wanted.
“Oooo you didn’t put lube there!” Was the comedic relief I needed after all the happy emotional tears 😂😭 and then the faces to follow lmao I don’t want these series to end 😭😭
Steven made me choke up too 🥺❤️
Just ordered the letters to my baby for my sister who is a new mom! ❣️ hope you guys are doing well 💕💕💕
What song are the playing?
Yay! Another episode! Always look forward to The Perkins vids!
This entire journey has been so beautiful to watch! Can’t express how happy I am for you two and the whole family 💕💕Little baby will be raised so well and the amount of love here is so incredible to see 🥰🥰🥰  I also can’t help but wonder how the video at 10:17 was taken, when the camera moved but Steven wasn’t holding it, I was like 😮😮 magic 😅
You deserve this 🥺 you deserve everything you’re getting and more 🥺💕 such a beautiful family and such great support! Wish you the absolute best!!!
I love you guys so much. Your journey makes me so happy
My guess for baby Perkins name is Torrance or Redondo 😆  Also please tell me y’all bought that snoop shirt for him
This shoot was so sentimental, I cried looking at your beauty Desi 🥺
Ahhhh my heart is exploding 😭❤️
Making my day better. 💛💛💛💛 love you guys!!!
Please frame that elephant and put it in the nursery 😭😭😭
The beginning.... I cried. I don’t know if it’s my pregnant emotions or just me. 🥺
Wow Desi is an artist

I love your opening theme song. Reminds me of peter pan
I’m 5 months pregnant & I cried during the maternity photo shoot. How can a human be this beautiful 🥺 love you Desi & Steven 💙
Take extra clothes!! My 2nd blew out of his diaper as we were getting ready to leave the hospital 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️.
Omg as soon as that music started for the shoot 😭

Who remembers the days when Desi had to wear cutlets in her bra to look like she had boobies 🥺😂
I wanna know what his name is !!!
There’s been so much heaviness in 2020 but honestly Desi you and Stevens pregnancy has been the highlight of this year. Thanks for sharing such special moments with us ❤️

This whole journey that you have brought us a long it’s an honor and it’s absolutely beautiful 😭😍❤️ Steven has been amazing through this whole journey, but seeing him cry just talking about you.... 😭😭😭 PLEASE NEVER STOP
6:02 I’m crying ! How beautiful was that shoot! 😍
The maternity shoot was sooo beautiful. Made me cry. Desi you are a goddess. Steven you are an amazing man. You’re relationship and love for each other is goals. Btw I loved the blue tones for the baby’s outfits to bring him home in. You guys will be the best parents,
Guys- your baby could come earlier then you think... my little guy was born 3 weeks early because I was low on amniotic fluid.  Just sayin!  So be prepared for anything at this point and you will do just fine!  I’m so excited for both of you!
Desi’s Glow is next level 😍😍😍  Ste’s & Fam’s support throughout the video. So amazing!!
Can we all not get a spouse like Sven???
Ogni video è sempre più emozionante.. Love you guys, you're the purest, real and beautiful people I've ever seen. So happy for you, so much. You more than anyone else deserve this joy. Congratulations, go hard ❤️ best future parents in the woooorld ❤️

I always thought my baby would be 2 weeks early and she ended up being 5 loooong days late! 🥰🥰 my girl was born on April Fools ❤️❤️❤️
Desi, I had no stretch marks either rebut when I gave birth and my belly went down I actually had tiny ones . It’s crazy?
This baby is going to be so loved. The love they already have before his birth is so inspiring ❤️
Stretch marks are genetics its either going to happen or not I don't believe you have any control over it.  I just love Steven's support its soooo cute and honorable.

August 3rd I gave birth at 32 weeks. Opening shot got me.
I can't wait for the baby to be born. This series is exciting, beautiful and special to watch, but imagin when the Perkins's Baby Boy is born I won't be able to hold my emotions down from all the excitement. It's going to be one of the best day of our lifes. I can't say this enough. I'm so happy for the both of you and your family. You are going to be the best parents in the world. I'm so happy God has blessed and granted your wish to be parents. Take care Desi and Steven,  love you to the moon and back.
I haven't even finished this episode and had to come and comment. I'm balling 😭😭.  So beautiful!! 😭 Ok back to the episode...
Girl you had me crying on your photo shoot. 😢💙 Beautiful!!
Desi don’t hate me but I hope u get some stretch marks... only bc I know U will ROCK them!! I never see any gurus post or show them and I just feel like i would feel better abt myself if I see others rocking them too 🤣💕
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
The way your mom is looking at you has me in tears 🥺 You can feel her happiness for you through the screen 💚
The way you look at each other is so beautiful ❤😭
That video of you guys at the beach by the rock is literally the first scene in Grease 😍😍
Your belly cast is BEAUTIFUL. I’m so sad I didn’t do my shoulders. I just did straight across. They’re so fun to decorate though🤍
Your shoot was sooo beautiful. Literally in tears 😭😭
There’s too much to say that words alone are not enough to express.... congratulations, you will be amazing parent! 😭🤯😳🥰☺️🙃🤰🤱👨‍👩‍👦
Just here to say the jelly to make the cast come off easier does not help that much!! Lol  I used it and it still hurt to take off!
Steven is most definitely a ZADDY! Love the love between u two! Desi u look absolutely breathtaking ❤️ crying and smiling this whole video!
I am 15 weeks! And you give me all the feels! So excited to see baby Perkins!!! Beautiful journey! Thanks for sharing with us!! 🥰🥰
The only photo shoot she ever expected. So beautiful! 💫
Your videos brighten my days🙏🏽❤️✨ thank you for sharing your journey! When I think of y’all, I pray for y’all and wish you all an abundance of joy, happiness and most importantly health❤️❤️✨🌸🙏🏽🙏🏽
So beautiful, so much love.
I deleted Instagram but I keep re-downloading it to see if you had your baby😭😭 so happy for your family!!!!💙
The cutest video so far!!! The baby cast adorable!!! How Steven teared up awww.  Ok baby Perkins please be born October 19so we can celebrate together!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
It’ll be bittersweet when the series ends because we’ve all been praying for this moment for Desi and Steven , but I can’t wait for all the parenthood videos to come and see them become a family of 6 and yes that includes the dogs 😂🥰
The opening to these videos makes me happy every time♥️  Also, it’s so hard to say wether you’d get stretch makes or not! Some people even get them AFTER the baby comes.  I personally didn’t get any stretch marks pregnant or postpartum. My daughter is almost 2 months old💓
😭😭😭you guys.......the vibe that you transmit it’s so amazing. I’m sooo happy for you guys. 😍
No two people deserve this more than you & Steven, this journey that you two have shared with us is absolutely beautiful, I have so enjoyed every single episode xoxo
Omg so beautiful!!!🥰🥰
I’m literally crying during this entire video 😭
I always seem to watch these when I'm drunk and without fail I sob uncontrollably
As someone whos never been too set of having a baby of my own, watching Desi and Steven has completely changed my outlook on it. Watching their journey from episode 1 to now...ugh I just cant wait to be able to have my own<3 Desi is gonna be a fantastic mom!
YOU LOOK AMAZING NO DOUBT 😍
Is the baby name gonna be Elefanto 🥰😜
I seriously love this series and everything it has captured from every emotion. I truly can’t wait you see your family grow and prosper through everything ❤️❤️
I have 30pgs of objectives to memorize by tomorrow for my 1st pathophysiology exam for nursing school, but here I am 😭😭
DESI!!!! You've always been a beautiful woman and now you're a beautiful mama!! I have been following you for so long and I remember your struggle and pain and to see this pain turn into joy and happiness has been so amazing. I wish you and the baby all the health in the world. I am so happy for you and your family. 💕
the maternity shoot i got GOOSEBUMPS omg you look divine❤️
I’m so happy for you !!!!🥺💓 Congratulations 4L
So happy for you guys! Congrats! I cant wait to see your new bundle of joy!
I wish wish wish I had the pregnant glow that Desi has. It breaks my heart that I am so hard on myself, being pregnant is the best thing to happen to me but I am so unhappy with how I look. I wish I had it in me to do the photoshoots and the belly cast. Maybe next time
Baby Perkin is very lucky to have so many people loving him already. I'm so happy for you two 💖
Wow Sven is straight repping all @StaticJon in this video!!!!!! I love it!!
Kinda surprised they are out and about tbh especially w her being pregnant. Saw they were at shayla get together yesterday I believe. Idk, if I were pregnant I would just be scared of going out w others etc
The amount of love surrounding him already makes me so emotional ♡ a baby deserves nothing less. So happy for you all 🤧
why did I cry during the maternity shoot omg 😭😭😭 she looked like a literal angel wow.
I cry on every episode because it’s so lovely to see such a beautiful couple and strong souls come together to make their dream come true... my blessings to the Perkins family ❤️
IN TEARS
You exuded so much confidence during the photo shoot. Then the way your mom looked at you with so much love and happiness. Could feel the genuine emotions in the room. Just beautiful. May God continue to look upon you each step of the way. And bless baby Perkins!
I AM TIA! An Icee and a shot! 😭😭😭😭 Final stretch guys! Thank you again for taking us on this journey!
The way your mom looked at you during your goddess shoot and the music playing in the background, that’s when I started to cry. 😭  Creating memories of a lifetime , for your child/children to look back on. ✨😍❤️
Your journey has been truly  magical to watch. Every episode has been  special. It has left me with so many emotions and memories of my pregnancy that flew by. My baby turns one in October. So happy for you guys.
Outfit changes are so necessary. I only brought 3 and I regret it. He peed on everything 😂 First time mom problems
Desi is definitely cherishing her boobs this whole pregnancy 😂 she can’t stop talking about them 😂 girl I would be too if my boobs grew that much bigger 😂
i have yet to make it through a video in this series and not cry
💗💗💗 aww I loved feeling hiccups! Wishing you all the best for the remainder of this journey, such a special time 💙
Steven so funny.
All the tears during the photoshoot!!😭 Gosh... you look so breathtaking!!😍💙
I am crying because i am pretty sure your next update will be of you giving birth or going into labor..words cannot express how happy i feel for you guys. Me and my 3 kids(8,6 & 3 yr old)have been following your pregnancy updates,they can't wait to see the baby. Whenever they see im watching youtube they tend to ask "mommy is the baby of the lady that grows fruit born yet?" 🥰💙🙏
Cuteeeee
I still think that having a baby shower during these times was really irresponsible. And with a baby present? Damn....... I loved everything about this and your journey is very special but idk about not following social distance
Aw, such an honour & pleasure to witness your pregnancy journey unfold! 💗 Thanks for sharing :)
So beautiful 🤍😍🧸
I am genuinely so happy for you guys. 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️🥺
Steven kinda acts a lil feminine to me 😱
My baby name guess is something old school. Like Kristov or Olaf!
Baby dropped omg 😩😩😩😩 almost almost
Bawling my eyes out, I can't wait for baby P to come already!! I feel like this vlog shows how you and Sven have become so much closer with each other, you both are so patient with each other. Baby p is going to be one lucky boy to have the most cool parents!! Congratulations Desi & Steven!! I love you!!!
woah im fkn early.
Watching you being so in love with this pregnancy is amazing. But to see this amazing support system you have that is equally in love with you and this beautiful bundle of love is just astonishing. I love you guys and wish you nothing but blessings.
💞💞💞💞

You guys are so beautiful together 💕
I just cried so much 🥺❤️
I’m so dedicated to these updates. Cannot wait to see the baby and the next memories you will share with us 😭🥰
You guys ♥️😭♥️😭♥️
When baby comes, won’t be able to get up and leave anytime u want, well it’s gonna be tiring every time if u do lol... baby might not love being in cars, some babies don’t like traveling,.. my cousins baby, she had to fly out, and the whole few days they were gone, her baby just cried and cried, ... even trying to be at the mall the store... she’d stop tho when sleeping.. .. so enjoy all the freedom, but I know u guys are so ready and have baby be included! I’m soooo excited!!! I can’t wait to see baby!!
Yeahhhhhh!!!!! 💙💙💙 Your belly is there. Desi you look stunning 😍
This story and everything about your family is beautiful ✨
I teared up when you teared up in the photo shoot😭 you can just see the love that you both have for each other and I’m so happy for you guys🥺🤍
Omg my hair has been that long!! I can’t tell you how many times I accidentally sat on it😭😭
Desi and Steven .... when your baby boy is born, and you see him for the first time, that’s when you will know a love like no other. That’s when you will know how much your mother loves you, and that’s when you will know how much GOD loves you ❤️ it’s an unconditional love beyond measure 💕....  love you guys 🌺
i cant believe he's almost here 😭💙 im ao excited for you guys ! and the maternity shoot was just UGH 😍😍😭 gave me chills the way ur mom was looking at you and how beautiful you looked 😭😍😍😍
Your vision throughout this whole journey is so beautiful and speaks to all the mom to be and the women who are trying to conceive.  It gives me so much hope. I know that when I'm finally able to become pregnant,  it will be out of this world and just magical! Every episode makes me tear up so much.  ❤❤
I feel so very proud of u,.. from seeing you crying and having so much disappointment when u guys couldn’t get pregnant,.. then now, here u guys are... it’s amazing.

Desi you’re so gorgeous (always have been). Your maternity shoot! Beautiful! Seeing this journey for you has been so sweet. Love how you’re making all these memories with your family as part of it all. Baby Perkins is so loved already. ✨💕
desi is having the most iconic pregnancy ever,  i love it so much ❤️
You are stunning Desi, I am so happy for you😍💕
I just imagine all the poop explosions that will happen on those cute baby outfits! Lmao 😫
You did a video a couple years ago where you dressed up as Selena. You talked about how you sat in your costume every year waiting for a child to come to your door so you could give them candy. Well, from  here on out your Halloween’s will be absolutely amazing! ❤️
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Only place I got stretch marks was my boobs and my hips. I had 6 children.
3:39 Hi, 5ft tall girl with 3ft long hair here! I actually do wrap it around my neck! Long hair lifeee
Baby boy it's going to be here so soon! I bet you're getting super excited! I love the name Emilio if you haven't decided yet, it's a cute one! I really hope you teach him Spanish!
👍
So much love ❤️❤️❤️ can’t wait to finally meet him 💕
getting stretch marks isnt actually to do with your skins moisture/condition. Its to do with your core strength and how strong your abs are pre-pregnancy
This has been such a beautiful journey and I am always excited for you both!!! You guys will be such great parents ♥️
Steve bringing the fire with his drone shots🥵🥵🥵you guys are the dream
You look o gorgeous desy much love to u and the rest of the family🥰🥰🥰

the love you two radiate for each other is so damn beautiful <3 im so excited for you both.

Steven getting emotion about how you owned your photo shoot 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The photo shoot is BEAUTIFUL I’m crying 😭❤️❤️❤️

These photo gives total Beyoncé vibes
I teared up when you cried at the shoot. I’m pregnant with my rainbow and I got emotional so I can only imagine your emotions seeing your dream become reality with your own rainbow and after years of trying. God bless your beautiful family!

Where is there a clone of Stephen? Just wondering....
STEVEN YOU ARE SOOOO HAPPY !!! Everyone is excited to see Desi floursh as a mother but Steven is gonna be such an amazing father!!!!!!!!
So beautiful. One of my local photographers did this and it was so beautiful, she used the mins belly case as like a "nest" for newborn photos and the baby was in it. It was do beautiful
I don’t want this series to end 😭😩🥺 can’t believe it’s almost time
Aww always enjoyed ur videos. Amazing 😭😍🥰
Jellycat stuffies are the softest. I keep buying them for my kids. Unfortunately they don’t stay that soft once you wash them and I looked up all sorts of tricks to try to maintain the softness.
Love love love watching you both and are so happy for you!!!💜💜💜💜
Gosh you two are the cutest!!! Can’t wait for baby Perkins to make his grand entrance 🙏🏼✨
My boyfriend thinks the names might be Jeremiah, Joseph, Isaac, Abraham, David 🤔
Every episode blows me away for the high quality 😍😍❤️
Love how much Stevens love for you is so profound like a worship.
Curled up with my pregnancy pillow crying my eyes out. Such a beautiful shoot. Inspired me to book somewhere to do mine xx
Dude Katy hugging desi with so much love...i cannot 😭  Also, I freaking can’t w Jon and his coupon codes 😂
Desi goddess makes me wanna cry😭😍
NICU nurse here 🙋🏻‍♀️ after you wash all the clothes, blankets, stuffed animals start to sleep with them near you/in your shirt! That way baby will have your scent as soon as he is born ♥️
I can't get thru any of these episodes without balling my eyes out!! I'm so excited for you two!!
7 minutes in and steven is making me cry 🥺🥺 the maternity shoot was so surreal desi’s absolutely glowing
Lol Jon used to dj when I was at Sonoma!
Didn’t think I could cry with this episode but I did 😭😭❤️🙏🏽
This is such a beautiful vlog! You are glowing Desi! You and Steven are going to be amazing parents!  Also, is Steven left handed? I noticed when he was mixing the waffle batter in the baby moon footage. If so, Im left handed and get excited when I see another lefty haha! That would be awesome if baby Perkins is lefty! They say left handed people are usually creative and artistic 🥰
i got the chills watching your shoot, so angelic and beautiful💙
everything about this series is so pure, blissful and amazing. so appreciative you share this experience with us, makes me so happy😭🤍

On the 24th was my birthday ☺️☺️☺️
ALL THE FEELS!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭 Y'all never cease to amaze me!! Much love!!!! 🥰💙💙💙💙💙💙
Awwww what a great video. Gotta ask was it hard get any remnants of the cast from your skin or did it easily wash off in the shower. I wanna do one and was just wondering. It came out awesome !!!
Your family brings so much happiness to my heart congrats desi 🧡
The way your mom was looking at you during the photoshoot 😍😍 pure love!!!
This is just Beautiful ❤ GOD bless 🙏❤
You guys, this might be the last video of the baby in the belly 😭😭😭 No, you are crying 🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️♥️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I replied to your story on Instagram about how your staycation home really reminded me of Mexico 🥺❤️ I cry every episode in such a good way CONGRATS YOU GUYS

Latina women are less likely to get stretch marks. Especially with first pregnancy my opinion
Your baby painting was too beautiful 😍
