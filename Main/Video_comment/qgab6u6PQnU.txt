Money dont make you real💯
If he didn't say this we'd all still be confused if our niggas real or its Money.. I'm glad I'm part of the ppl who think this way but feel wrong then there's ppl who say it I know I'm not mad or jealous 2024 till I'll forever support both jack and Kodak I'm from Africa so we're free to support all of them equally
Mara Jack this song was supposed to be 4min atleast

Top 5 SONGS OF JACKBOY
Money don't bring happiness 💯 been happy comes from the creator. God or Allah or whatever u call him the one and king The creator of the universe is one whatever language u call him. Respect to Jack boi africa rock with yuh.
Talented and determined. Go hard ❤️
Kodak black bunny better than Jack   https://youtube.com/shorts/Rmhdcrx0Sxs?feature=share
This go super hard
MAAANNNNNN Jackboy is so fukin real ! ! ! he is not that some fukin other trappers who usin that *Authentic views* to go viral instantly
This beat really something different
I love you bro and i don't even know you. Like Jesus loves everybody but he doesn't know every body because the really never just give him tim and acknowledge that this is real God sent his son to die for us and one day the doors going to close and he going to say depart from me I never knew you go outside the gates there will be weeping and nashing of teeth nothing for a human right there. Acknowledge Jesus in all his ways it's still time
Keep Jesus
I'm glad Jackboy shining even when I didn't make it to see someone with the same ambition as me make it I'm happier for Him
This song is motivation to keep it pushin!🔥
Duro duro 🇭🇹🇭🇹 🔥🔥
Inspiration and speaks real in his music

JackBoys music Just keeps getting better and Better. His two self Titled albums are amazing, Just as the rest of his Catalogue. What I love about JackBoy2 is that there's clear signs that he's improved as an artist, His lyrics are the best they have ever been and His vocals are a Lot better in Comparison to some older projects.  JackBoy2 is Jackboys best album to date, and I doubt anyone Could change my mind.
Long long way
De la France 🇫🇷

Jack consistent and don't drop trash
He Turned his back on sniper gang and ain't safe in his hood anymore it must be depressing having nobody around him all alone in a different state or country sure he's making that money but can't be very fun being alone or surrounding yourself with random fake friends I used to fkk with jackboy but soon as he started getting money and fame he changed it went to his head and he now thinks he's better than everyone and I bet he doesn't even realize it

You shouldn't have to ask when you already see the pain ☄☄☄ So did yak let you out the contract???
Jack! Speaking facts… I can’t even watch #BILLKAPRI videos anymore, cause of he keeps SNAKES in them🤮
the whole rap genre and its sub genre's really did go to shit. how tf do yall listen to bullshit like this? if you cant even sound good talking and u have to use auto tune this heavily your ass dont deserve a fuckin cent, yall dumb af supporting shit like this. listen to REAL music.
Perfect timing and you said what you had to say. He just did all this to send a message. Boss move.   If yall could go back in time that be dope. Still, it's all respect here.
Jackboy always be speaking facts. I’m so happy to see this man winning. He pours everything in his music. May we all win someday❤️
Kodak better💯!
🔥🔥
Lets fuccin GO JACKBOY 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
fire!
We could’ve been super stars. 🥶
You make great music bro , I love you & yak
https://youtu.be/7XvIoZFJrZc enough said
He been snapping lately
Bro really went in ‼️ I felt the pain in this one ☝🏾
Underrated...
Kodak ain’t slick dropping right after jackboy😂😂
Good story. But all this is some kid with money behind him, rented cars, advertising, rented jewelry and most IMPORTANTLY a voice thats simply average without the use of auto tune. I will be bashed as a “hater” because thats “en vogue” these days to call anyone that makes a statement outside of celeb worship. However, I see no talent. None. Kudos to the message and the lyrics. Very positive. But, this is a reflection of humanity- idol worship of people like Lil Nas X who has ZERO talent and uses demonic imagery and the lefts fascination with gay culture to build a career. Now please do go right for the usual homophobic rant or call me a racist. MANY gay artists are superior. Its not because they are gay but because they are truly talented. Same goes for black artists and brown and white et al. MLK said it best- lets not judge a man for his color but for his character and in this case, talent. Lets see talent over popularity and the sheep mentality and liking someone bc every one else does. What I speak is truth from the heart. If you are offended by any of my words you have been programmed and are not spiritually evolved. Perhaps a look in the mirror. You will be dead one day- what kind of life do you want to lead? The one your soul wishes for you, or the one that the technocracy and your peers have commanded you to lead?
🐐🔥
🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🥰📍
people who like this music dont think much
Ivory costa luv you  brooo
this guy is such a hypocrite . he says money dont make you real in a many different ways...while he shows off all his pointless crap. if he was real , he,d give it away .   he is literaly saying one thing and then acting a completely different way. can no one else see this?  rap culture is nothing but a shallow spectacle.  its not that "money dont make you real" its that money makes you unreal. ...but money must mean something to him, he needs you to see his.
Gas 🔥🔥🔥
Jack now you do music kodack doing shit
Rip jack

On the way to become a latest meme song😀
🔥🔥🔥🔥
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
Grimace?
Money don’t make you real it’s a distraction in fact it might make you ill
