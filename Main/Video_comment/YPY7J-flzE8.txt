Why attack? Send a probe to release a deadly pathogen.
I really wanna go to the place of a quiet day series. (With my wife) 🙃
Lupita is representing us very well thanks 🇰🇪
spoiler alert: movie is all about to get a slice of pizza...wait a minute...
Is this the Netflix version. Looks like it.
Why those Creatures are not attracted by the noise they make?
Why is the background theme music similar to the movie "A quiet place: Day one" trailer?
Considering the franchise (excluding the game rn) is confirmed to be set in New York State/New York, then this means the aliens have canonically hit the second tower.  Hate me, but i had to.
Wow i want to see this movie😁

Why isn't Emily Blunt in this? It's her movie. She should be in this.

Смотрель фильм 2025. Ок 6-7/10 точно виш 5 . Да, огляд фильма, я смотрю фильм Тихое место, это приквел третьей части, как раз то, я кстати, на Твиттере. Клёво, мне и да, кстати, на Твиттере интересно смотреть фильм. Думаю, вот, посмотрю этот фильм. Возможно, фильм реально слабее, чем первые 2 частки, но всё же, дам ему шанс, и попробую посмотреть. Мне всё же интересен жанр Апокалипсиса, тут как раз, ну, самое, точка чумлянки. Ну, там... В принципе, рецензии там неплохие. Скорее мало в виду, что плохие оценки на Кинопоиск, KMB, они просели немного. Сомнению с первыми частями, которые были где-то около 7, тут же около 6 или даже 5. Но... Мне все же интересно, там... Поспокалипсис этому отдал шанс. Вот. В принципе, фильм уже начал смотреть. Пока все хорошо, мне нравится. Скажу, что это прям вау, 10 из 10. Нет, ну... В принципе, нормально. Наверное, 6 из 10 или даже 7, думаю, заслуговывает. Может, даже реально 7. В принципе, неплохое, неплохое. Паника людей. Прикольно. Масштаб немного чувствуется. Да, это не прям мегаголливуд, это прям мегаголубастер. Но все же масштаб покалипсиса местами чувствуется. Массовка тут местами есть. Людей довольно много убегает от этих монстров. Что-то люди как бы с понятием, что надо умолчать, когда-то привыкают. Победительство, армия не справляется. Возможно, немного больше стоило бы показать армию, если бы она не хватала, чтобы шельцы как-то быстро... ...затем расправились. В принципе, сцены прикольные. Вот. Возможно, покалипсис наступил бы еще чуть-чуть быстрее. Шельцы могли бы чуть дольше сопротивляться. Ну, ладно. Ну, в целом, сцена прикольная. Щок и панику людей хорошо показал Ну, там...

Should make one were the Herman race fights back and whites them out
a mute cat?! not a single miaw? they should've stop on number two.why????
Yeah, it started out about a family a white family and of course it did well then they had to bring Queen Latifah in… huh??? didn’t get my money….😂
1:38
1:26 ALIEN COVENANT!
It was ok, Would of liked more talking however🙄 A tad boring😴
Funny how in 0:37 she screams “help me !” And in the final movie she screams jonathan 2 times
The first and second movies is bad 🤢 I hope this one is better
Naff compared to the first two
Agggggggggh
Mayonnaise
Boom
Haaa
Day 1
Day 1
Lupita Nyong'o wrong choice.....
Loved the movie but they could have done way way more
I think it is disturbing and disgusting that they keep showing us how the aliens will come to eat us, and you all people still don't see it. The things that are coming are so severe that almost no one will be left standing in the end.
Predator vs Death Angels(A Quiet Place monster) would be intense. The Predator is a perfect rival because it knows how to be silent and how to move undetected.
https://aymanbokhsi.blogspot.com/2025/02/aquietplacedayone2024mp4.html
So, I have a serious technical question. If a person talks in their sleep, or fart, are they done?
من اسوء الممثلين اللي مروا على الأجزاء كلها بكل جداره
Is it me or does the monster look like the zombie from the last of us i believe they call it the clicker
1:05 so obviously AI generated
They blew it. This movie was so lame. Instead of being about the creatures and mass death around the planet it's about a black woman from Africa or some crap and her f****** cat. So much blew a perfect opportunity for a great alien monster Invasion beginning. Lame lame lame lame lame.
1 rule for survival in case like this: never ever join crowds. The cat was so smart and cute and amazing to be a part of this movie.
Did you take the gold juice ???? Middle East gave itctovyouvrovlivecforever at other people's expense
Angelina  , is this your again taking middle eastern gold juice
I've started this movie no less than 6 times in the last couple days.. I still haven't seen more than 15 min of it.
I don't care what anyone thinks, this movie is a 10/10.
I think the cat is the main character in this movie I'm just watching it right now.
wasn't feeling it (at all) 'til eric ...cat was next best actor
really?! a third one! i knew this would suck!!!!
"A quiet pizza"  should be the perfect name for this movie 😅😅
Don't bother. So disappointing
Bad and boring movie compared with the previus one and two.
8:59 am march 20th 2025
I’m about to watch this movie for the first time
Quiet place Transformers crossover.
I ve watched this  movie  yesterday  and in my view that cat is best actor  .how could  a cat could  keep silent  for that long in the movie
I did not like this, and other than the creatures it had NOTHING to do with one and two
This is crap  some silly fool has lost a lot of money 😂 Can anybody come up with a new story or are they just keep rehashing the same old crap ??
I liked this better than other two.
One fart and you are gone
Listen, the only thing I was concerned about through this whole movie was the cats safety. 😂
2025 anyone? 😢
Saw this, very overrated and the plot was extremely simple (basic)
Garbage movie. I couldn’t see a thing. And the whole film has characters brooding the whole time.
❤❤❤❤
Please please stop !!!!! "I wish they would stop casting black actors in lead roles in movies." "They are ruining movies,  making them tasteless and uninteresting to watch." Please stop please
No chance I’m risking it for someone else’s cat. Keep that cat on a leash or pay the consequences. That was ridiculous she kept taking it off and never learning her lesson
Trailer:🔥 Movie:💩
Amazing how this trailer is telling you a different history instead when the movie realesed
I would've actually enjoyed this movie if I could f^#**n see what's going on. The majority of it was all pitch black, barely seeing silhouettes and just their eyes and my TV brightness was jacked up to the highest setting.
Boanoites
Man they ruined the movie series with this one… always trying to push stuff people don’t want
This film was disappointing. Couldn't keep my attention.
Another trash movie by woke
All the aliens were doing is making New York better
You baited me into thinking there’d be some cool airstrikes with the shot at 1:00, but instead I was presented with filth.
As a Quiet Place fan and a Cat person, this movie feels like a waste of time. The film was basically about a quest for Pizza, and it should've rename it as A Quiet Pizza, don't waste your time on this...
I wanted to like this movie.... it was a terrible woke mess. I am certain they forced DEI crud in this for money to produce
I found this movie to be so boring, sure there were jump scares, but the storyline and characters were underwhelming, however, the first two movies are amazing. If you haven’t seen them, I would  recommend to skip this one and watch first two instead.
I don’t know about anybody else but I cried my eyes out watching this especially the ending. Joseph Quinn had me believing every second of his roll 😢
extremely woke hateful movie. They portray all the white men as either aggressive and rude, or, weak puppy dog followers. No heroes, as usual. The black and minority persons are of course portrayed as wise and calm. Just more hate propaganda.
We want Eric's present day along with Frodo
It would be really cool to see a quiet place film based before this one telling the origin of why the aliens came to earth, maybe telling a story about a top secret space agency traveling to a destination in space and the crew somehow accidentally disrupts them, maybe the signals from the ship lead to them killing off the crew and in discovering where the ship originated from they set out to earth, it would be cool if they somehow were a peaceful civilization until our involvement disrupts them
Just when I thought these movies couldn’t get any worse
Awwww 😍,so sweet,Lupita looks so cute bonding with more white"men".and the way the save each other,it's like they belong together,awwww😍.
Couldn’t be a more unlikable lead character. Movie was made for 12 year olds.
The first two were excellent. And shove this progressive pile of garbage.
Cool blockbuster nowadays 7/10
5 electromagnetic pulse 5
Just finished watching the Quiet Place day one ! I LOVED the cat ! Best actor in the Movie except for the fact it was Bogus ! Anyone who ever owned a Cat knows THEY HATE Being Soaked from water ! Yes some don’t they’ll play with a Drippy sink occasionally! My second Problem was that the United States Government did NOTHING to help the people of NEW York City ! Was this the Biden Administration cause if it was That’s understandable then ! Oh yeah  the Jets Blew up the bridges to stop Anything or Anyone from crossing and that’s what Biden would do too ! But Overall this was Mostly a Sluggish and extremely Depressing movie ! Especially after we just had Christmas and New Years ! Sorry I watched !
Seen the movie. Nothing special about it. You can skip it
I loved how the movie started out loud and TAPERED into a LOW noise volume allowing for it to FADE into the distance.
Great movie to play in if you have trouble memorizing your lines
World's coming to an end, so.... who wants pizza?
Absolutely loved it— very different from the first movie, mind you, but emotional and driven. A very refreshing type of horror movie, some scenes had me on edge, some scenes made me smile, but all in all I think it was intelligently laid out and most importantly, it was an enjoyable watch.
Why they dress my girl like smokie from the PJ’s?
great movie, thank you John
Excellent script and all star cast! Great movie and well done 🎉🎉🎉
This is literally "You owe me a pizza" from Final Fantasy VII Remake - The Movie
I give it a one out of ten 🙈 the value of life the leading characters had over even their own lives and their desire to survive the predicament before them was underwhelming and frustrating.
I loved the movie ❤
The first two were great.   This was a boring pile of woke trash.
Spoiler thr cat make it though the  film ❤
All the way through this movie I was more worried about the cat than I was any of the humans
Weak production, woke b.s.!   Wasted time !  :(
Lupita, the story, the music. Lovely movie
I’m so thankful that we have finally added an underrepresented community to the movies, bald black women, as leading roles in action movies. If that doesn’t say go get some, what else will??? #nothanks
This prequel was just plain aweful. Nothing to add to the story. Some lame relationship with garbage story. Skip it.
Exhaustingly boring movie and as many have pointed out,it explains nothing. There was no need for this to be made.
I liked it. Just a few parts felt too unbelievable like when she swam underwater with her cat in an I love NY shoulder bag
Horrible!
This movie was annoying ... the premise was weak.  So, despite an alien apocalypse and her survival at risk, the main character's number 1 priority was to get pizza?!  Meanwhile, a super-feminized weak man accompanies her all along with her prop-like cat.  My rating 2/10.
The actress is so talented, I’ve seen her in various movies and genres. She looks so thin and sick here
So glad I watched it last night via rental on Prime Video. Before coming here. I have a Tortie. She's 6. When I ssw the cat was an actual character in the film. It made the film more tense. I thought it was cute seeing the kitty wander along the street with a rat in front of it. Looking like he was chasing it. But he wasn't. The cat is way smarter than most humans in the film. Also if it was a dog. It would have died sooner and taken most of the humans around it with it. Since dogs can't keep quiet when they hear specific noises.
I love Lupita but I have to say if anyone gets an Oscar nomination for this movie it has to be the cat.  Stunning performance.
When I watched this in the theater I was prepared for loud scenes I was keeping my ears on the look out,btw I recommend this movie if u like loud,scary creatures,it’s by far the most scariest movie I’ve seen ,
Just watch 2 again to refresh up bout to get ready for this masterpiece
Joe Quinn’s going to carry the movie like he did to season four of stranger things
Quiet Palce - finding pizza would have been more appropriate title
洋画の街の環境音、クラクション鳴りまくりなの交通道徳終わってて好き
They could have setup a loud music in a dome.
Why is casting so rubbish now!!! great idea but casting can be better.
Spannende thriller.
not bad
This is not the sequel or continuation of :The quiet place 2. This movie has the  same story line but different characters. We can expect the 3rd part in 2025
Wth demogorgan doing in this movie? 😂😂
I want to see they build a armored tank or truck with speakers in poles or cold area becausemosters hate cold and go fight them with gun or sound of beeping radio like past episide that girl has and mic and speakers
The original plot for "A Quiet Place: Day One" was reportedly scrapped because it was considered too similar to the first "A Quiet Place" movie, with a focus on a family unit trying to survive in the monster-infested world, leading the creators to opt for a more unique perspective on the early days of the alien invasion with a different set of characters and a focus on a different part of the world…. mf idc you gave us a movie about pizza 👁️👄👁️like let us decide before you scrap decent plots for sh- ones😭
I have a theory on the death angels   I think the death angels are not truly natural, they may have been bio engineered by more advanced alien species, the advanced aliens placed the death angels on asteroids and placed them on a collision course to earth  Now that most of humanity is gone, the advanced alien species might decide to deploy “death angels” specialized for aquatic environments such as lakes and oceans and other death angels specializing in flight to take out remaining humans and just keep some as slaves
another hollywood woke movie...
Why do we have to ruin all movies by putting black inhuman things in them?
It seems that the film's director, producer and screenwriter have not raised a cat in his life, as they seem to be completely ignorant of this creature, to see it with this excessive calm, voluntary, voluntariness and fool throughout the film, especially in moments of horror and anticipation. 😂🤦
For Eddie ❤
Hey Paramount if you Really are Democrat supporter You truly should leave forever Because One you really gave No single F•k that People really wanted a New War of the Worlds prequel Movie for a Really long Time that had clean Quality effects better Than disrespectful Cruise children truly spoiled this Movie you truly gave No Single F•k about taking criticize Sonic note’s PS you Really are not listening The fan’s People wanted for long Time Should had been Delete Scenes version instead of took a scarp Out a it make a Movie in C•p I hope you’re Dumb Film whiter’s whoever wrote This Movie wrong Should get FIRED NOW for releasing a Black voice announcer Ruin a whole Thing about this Movie a voice who Done a better Job got Replaced

I wish we got the focus of like a military contractor or something. or the president . Like I just wish we could learn more about the logistics of trying to solve this if you're the government and you're at war with bizarre alien invasion
And the Oscar goes to......the cat! :)
Quiet Place .....finding pizza ....really trash history
Avg introvert would be expert in this kind of situation 😂🙂
The quietest cat in the world.
If teachers used this movie to scare students to be quiet 😂
Marvel's black bolt would go crazy in this universe
lol the stereotype of the jaded angry black woman at the start had me rolling,and they say holywood isnt based anymore
The vibe of The War of the Worlds. Will definitely see now after watching the trailer
I'm gonna watch this movie today wish me luck
as someone who have cats all i was thinking about is the cat 😢😢😢😢
What a masterpiece. They made a story that writes itself. So many perspectives to make.
mmmmm nota 5
Peak Hollywood mediocrity here. The first movie was okay. The next one pretty mid. This one? Abomination.
This is a complete waste of time, I prefer the quite place of six years back and that luita was here even breaks my heart the more, ease don't waste your time or data
Whoever wrote this abomination should resign . Not only is a woke POS, but the plot and the alien behavior is ridiculously bad . Ruining such a cool franchise with such a horrible take . I want my 90 mins back . Easily one of the worst movies I ve seen these years .
This is just like tom cruises war of the worlds all over again
njir 8 bulan lalu.. msih baru 😂 28M.. kesini gara2 windah 😂
Stupid movie, not like parts 1 and 2
Why the cat is silent in whole movie?
This movie sucked big time. A lot of sentimentalism and stupid decisions in the midst of chaos. Half of the movie focuses on a woman risking her life for a slice of pizza, a cat and a confused man obsessed with poetry. This is a waste of time.
1:00 Those are russian airshow su-30s without any weapons.... I had to
where can I watch it for free?
The game seems like the sequel of this movie
Too predictable and ludicrous..  The quest to get a pizza from a place, she used to go with her father..   How lame😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I liked a quiet place 1 and 2, but this prequel was such a let down.
Fans of the first two superior movies with the awesome Emily Blunt will enjoy a small connection with part 2, as well as a few jump scares and a few intense moments, but thats about it…otherwise, this was a disappointment overall except for the cat…imho
Well compared to the first parts this is a disappointment

What happens when you fart
This franchise deserves to be a series of atleast 5 seasons
الحمد لله ان خيالاتكم ماهي واقعية😰
I loved this. Didn't think it would move me the way it did. Beautiful story
And not one citizen used a personal gun to fight back. …    Sheep all left wing democrats.
Not a horror movie. Really more of a love story, but not the romantic kind.  This was actually a great film. And I love how they showed Djimon Hounsou’s beginning to tie it to the other movies.  Really liked it

Plot summary: a sick woman tries to fulfill her bucket list by sneaking into a pizza place with the help of a stranger
Imagine seeing yourself acting in this movie
It's not worth watching, let me tell you why....     Read more...  This was a massive opportunity for the creators to show a different point of view, perhaps a military perspective showing that they new it was coming and how they tried to defend their world, which we know ultimately failed...  Instead we follow two individuals which is what the other two movies were about so nothing original, so many plot holes to count, but let's name a few,   The cat is cgi, no cat makes no sound, meow, purr, hiss.   There's a huge crowd of people probably about 2 hours after first contact, they all know to be quiet, they all gather together, the amount of sound coming from their footsteps... Then the main character decides to get in the middle of them... I mean c'mon.... One person screams n your all doomed.  Next plot hole, generator powers on, makes huge noise, as we've seen these monsters react to the smallest sound, he gets it turned off and wow incredible not one monster turns up, oh then the smallest tear and a monster turns up..   The movie was totally predictable, boring, one giant plot hole.  Too much dust
Loved it. 😍
Schnitzel got no recognition.
Please don't waste your time watching this crap film, is utter garbage and quite frankly a disgrace to the Quiet Place brand. Honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen

It makes no sense that they can't see humans unless they make noise but they can see everything else.
First 10 mins it's announced don't make noise, no details how they knew.  Rest of the movie spent wondering if the cat going to be okay not a fun watch for me..great actors, boring main storyline. if your not going to put the original family parent's in..least do some different peoples story's and the army's to know how they know about them, 3/10

As soon as i seen that Cat I thought 💭 “Yep that cats going to meow at exactly the wrong moment” 😅 why carry a cat around in a situation like that? Leave the cat to fend for itself. It’s just a cat!!! Not worth risking yours and everyone elses life for.
What a bad movie this is. The pizza part was too much for me to handle. How can you want pizza in this type of circumstances?
They just wanted a little snack 😂
You know what would REALLY suck in this invasion?      Getting a cold
Quiet huh! ...Well, you know that all the blks would be gone Day One...
Beautiful movie!
Such a boring moving - couldn’t stand the stupid cat and ladies who kept bugging about pizza!

Honestly I watch any movie that has New York City burning can't wait

Sooo the second movie again just with different characters. Way to recycle ♻️
Wow the best quiet it place yet, and Lupita a gorgeous very talented actress… always in awe of her!
One of the most depressing boring dei movies I have seen. 1 out of 10. Absolute woke garbage.

Hills Branch
it's a globalist version: blacks, jews and other stuff. Any indians, asians and gays there? should be I guess.
If you are here for Review then listen :   This Movie was the dumbest movie you will see.. It could have been far far better if it were made with the perspective of Army or Scientists or Govt but no, this movie is based on the perspective of dumb characters..  Like, anyone can be killed for even making a sound but character wants to eat Pizza slice so they will walk they will Run and they will Swim just for that slice.. and another important thing is Cat, the life of Cat is important than anything in this movie..  In no scene it feels that stakes are high, infact this movie is so boring that you will fall asleep.. This movie should never been made if this was their idea..
100 love all 3 movies FANTASTIC, PLEASE GIVE US MORE❤

Be very quiet!
This was the most boring movie I've ever seen, hands down! It took me a week and 3 seperate tries to finish watching it!
You should have mentioned that this movie was meant for pet parents only. I really love acting and visuals, but the storyline and characters were so bad and irritating. The main plot in the last two movies was about survival, but in this one, it was all about saving the cat at any cost. I absolutely hate it.
I couldn't get past 10 minutes of the first movie, the silent schtick is unbearably annoying.
I come for cat😢
People who participate in there. Their cute ractions, stylish moviemaking, colors, moments and the idea itself.  When people give each other small moments and enjoy small things... It was so cuute when cat Meowed for  the first time at the end. Quality job's done.  Loved it so much.
I expected an alien origin.

This is what happens when you ban all assaults rifles, the monsters take over.
Ahhahahahahahaaaaa THIS MOVIE IS SO Unnecessary, over-hyped and just stupid  Why? And those creatures... Why?  The things that the entitled and mediocre people can do and get away with is just amazing!!! Nice check for Lupita, I guess  Weak wack movie!!! WPS
Just watched this last night. Horrible. The first ten minutes should’ve tipped us off but we endured till the end and now I’m certain. It was a waste of time. In the midst of obvious destruction, The main character wanted a slice of pizza! Cmon!!!! What an insult to intelligent people everywhere!🙄😑
Just watched this last night. I've seen the first and the second one and both of those movies were top tier nail biter edge of your seat scary! Day one on the other hand was lacking. I didn't feel at edge the entire time. It has a couple of scary scene but over all not a movie I would recommend or watch again 🤷‍♂️
Gonna finally watch all 3 of these movies in chronological order tonight! =D
Please release an extended version that shows Eric's backstory
Very very bad cast with Lupita
That has to be the most patient cat on the entire earth.
Me thinking thus movie was just another remake
Is that fungus/egg pod thing food?  How get it to gruw so fast?  I think it was food as one cracked it open then called fur utters to come and they seemed to be eating it.
Totally fantastic movie. Absolutely heart-wrenching for a horror movie. Highly recommended to watch. ❤️
Where was Emily blunt in the entire movie ??? Where was that scene??
the final title at the end of the trailer is a sound effect in alien covenant when he smokes a cigarette in the particles
I watched this because I thought they’d explain where those aliens came from.
The ending was the best ending that they could have done amazing. Watched it high and when she unplugged it I was shocked
I would end the story almost at the beginning! How pretel, Have barges out in the bay sounding their horns.😂
1&2 was waaaaaay better! I fell asleep twice and finally finished it the 2nd day but fell asleep again lol
What a let down
Trash.
#FINALPET!
Terrible movie 🙄😒
💩
One word: Stressful. Two words: Gray hair. 🙄😊
Spoiler: The cat is played by Tim Walz 😮
It's basically a movie about how to re-home your cat.
garbage 💩💩
one of the most boring movies i have ever seen
Another Woke movie. 🛑 it!
Bro so emotional 😭😭😭😭
This is the most logic-less movie I have  ever seen , 🤧
Flop movie
This had a lot of plot armor,  and especially that cat it's like Reiner from attack on titan, a quiet place plot armor should be the name 😂 but it was an okay movie so i don't regret watching it
Automatically won't watch, because the scenario of a black female being quiet for 90 minutes is more unrealistic than the Sharknado movies.
Watched the movie and comeback to not recommend next victim
It is the same or sequal of 2018 movie
Where is the army with machine guns???
I just want a moment of silence for the biggest star in this film: The Cat Frodo
I liked it more than the first two, and I enjoyed those tremendously. She's wonderful, so is Quinn, and loved seeing Djimon. And the cat, come on, just awesome. Could have been about 15 minutes longer, but it was ghood fun, and oddly moving.
That's not just a movie, it's probably a preview of coming  attractions.
This was a boring as movie. Not to mention the ugly actors.
The movie had so much potential if they would have showed at least 15 minutes of the invasion it would have been awesome
Amazing film but I  hated the idea (Black women and crazy with acat
That cat is the best thing from the whole movie!
I'm just here for the cat.
I watched this last night. Absolute garbage.
This movie was awesome, so much I watched it twice!
This movie is a waste or time don’t watch it
Watching it now. August 24 2024. 9:35AM PHILIPPINES MINDANAO, PROVINCE:MISAMIS OCCIDENTAL, OZAMIZ CITY 🎉  POPCORN OH NO SSSSHHHHH SHUT MY MOUTH
A quiet world would be nice
Was für ein schlechter Film schon wieder. Der war meine Zeit nicht wirklich wert ☝🏻🎩
فيلم رائع جدا ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This was the most boring movie for 2024 I've seen so far.
Trailer:🗿 Movie:🐈
THIS MOVIE WAS THE WORST OUT OF ALL THE QUIET PLACE ONES
AWFUL AWFUL MOVIE COMPLETELY LETS DOWN THE OTHER TWO MOVIES, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE LIKE INDEPENDANCE DAY BUT NOPE THEY MADE IT AS BORING AS POSSIBLE BOOOOOO
I'm confused, isn't part two was day one?
This is not what we're waiting for this was disappointed I hope they make a third part the next time at the level of the first two not this low level thing😢
Horrible jus horrible 😫🤦❕
Yea we want the family back this movie was 🚮
The goal is to get Pizza!  Okay bye!
quiet place is so overrated. Birdshot is a much better franchise. Better creativity and much more possibilities.
Not nice
This movie is stupid
If this happen in real life I'll be gone
My ankles click when I walk so I’m straight up dead 💀
Bro, 1 and 2 is so much better than this, quite disappointed.
The main character looks just like Tyrone Biggums from the Chappelle Show. Am i the only one who sees this?
What trash
Davis Larry Moore Brian Lewis Patricia
Not worth watching
Firs two film was much better than this crap, I'm glad I streamed this for free, movie was so trash. Combined scenes of the aliens "death angels" didn't even exceed 5minutes...
prequel movies are dumb. nobody cares we already know what's gonna happened later. just like house of the dragon. that's why it's not as popular as game of throne. cause nobody cares about what happened 300 years ago before game of throne.
The ending is incredible.
Saw it today. Ouch. I'm glad I didn't pay for this garbage.
This movie sucked
There is only one movie where humans are the sole invaders of another planet. In most others, it's as if they are only familiar with Earth. Yet, despite their advanced technology, the aliens are still defeated by humans. What kind of useless aliens are those dheiiiii..😑
Who’s here form the master’s voice? 🫤
What a dumb and boring movie! 🤮
/
Wow.. another woke horse sh...
Got to wonder, if all these things are capable of doing is killing people, how did they develop space travel?
I can’t wait for this to come out on paramount plus
This movie was so so boring
that was awful.  paid twenty five but amazon luckily gave me money back. awful
For some reason, aliens can hear all sounds but not shhhh.
I saw the black woman and instantly not interested
Answers you need from an origin film:  A.  Who are they? B.  Where’d they come from? C.  What do they want?  Fail.  Fail.  Fail.
My cat and I wouldn't survive 2 seconds before she'd growl or hiss or comment about something. Her loud purring alone would give us away. I need a soundproof carrier just in case.
woke garbage
All the aliens 👽 make the same sound
she is so ANNOYING whit her cat and pizza
Even a cat knows how to be quiet in this flick. 😂😂😂
I'm So Exited to watch this movie 😃  I waited for so long
gees, you cant even fart
I'll never watch a pg13 horror movie again
That cat would be dead!
Absolute failure
It was boring
Not everyone will watch this movie, the reason is, right there.
Such an irresponsible cat lady.
Because they are letting people know that we get attack by sound frequencies to make us have different moods like thru music or tv but most people don’t have a clue
dont watch this. so boring, lame story, the pace is so slow. aliens invaded, but the most important thing is my cat and slice of pizza...
Patsy's Pizza 😂 how much did he pay for this ad   2291 1st Ave. https://maps.app.goo.gl/RyBqg5MLFbdhjb886?g_st=ac
Is this happening in Africa?
Not this one. I'm waiting a real one.
saving private cat
Quiet place  -  mute is better Bird box - blind is better
The cat fked up the movie imagine the hole movie almostb 2 hours not a single meow or any voice its trash
Less action and psychological thriller, but more unnecessary things. Too bad.
i am amazed by tha cat who is awfully silent
The first 2 were great. This was a piece of crap. New directors who simply destroyed the movie. Saw it once. Will not watch again.
Wack
scam  1:00  no firefighter jet scene in this movie
I just watched it but kind of disappointed as it didn't exceed the level of excitement that the previous movie (Quiet Place) has had. This one is a downgrade, quite boring to be honest. Why would one (Samira) be so stubborn of having the pizza at the expense of her life and of others? The cat to be there has done nothing impressive there except as a burden to escape death from the aliens? Really a downgrade as compared to the previous movie. Just an honest review.
I wish it was Sophie wilde instead of
waste your time & Overacting to much Lupita Nyong'o
I regret paying $20 bucks to rent  this movie. I give it 1 star rating. I just don't like the story to it. That black lady is a bad actress. This movie is too predictable. It just wasn't what I expected
Was this movie scary?
Meh...felt like I was watching a movie like 12 years a slave or something... Oh no wait.. they made the white man freak out and be all sorts a crazy... Another attempt by Hollywood to demean and destroy the white man ..unless you pirate the movie, I don't recommend it
Как же испортили фильм🤦‍♂️ сюжет фильма не о чем, игра актеров оставляет желать лучшего, ошибок сколько в отношении монстров, их слуха. Как обычно первый фильм лучше всех последующих
the first 2 was perfect
Going to see this movie in about 2 hours  I’m excited 😅😅😅
Movie is not all that.
One of the best rubbish movie ever seen.👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
I yust saw the movie erlyer today and it was a banger! 🤯
In the beginning of the movie it was so loud in the theater and made it uncomfortable. I don't know if it was the theater that had the audio system so loud or if that's the way it was filmed. I walked out.
Why does the main actress wear ugly clothes
This movie was so bad. The characters were insufferable, the plot was paper thin. YAWN.
0:15 28 years later Easter egg?
Anyone knew what's the alien race call?
Que bosta de filme, tanta história para contar sobre os aliens...
They ruined the other 2 i felt asleep with this one.
When the quiet neighbor finally fed up with ur loud noise 😅
Soo interesting!! Lupita killed it
Such a boring  film. Don't waste your  time.
the question is : how do they fart silently ?
I love cat and pizza 🥹
Deleted scenes:  0:33 some people were not in this scene  0:27 this guy is dancing  0:39 this woman is screaming “help me”  1:11 this scene where the aliens are all around them  There is also a scene where the puppeteer dies in another trailer  Also where Sam looks up at the sky showing her face  Sam also looks at a map and say “I have a plan”
Je le recommande pas
Average movie totally time waste.
what a great movie a must watch.
I could watch the whole movie just because of one reason  .. I won't be able to bear if anything happens to the cat... So please someone tell me that the cat survives in this entire movie
Garbage compared to the previous movies, don't bother...
Mid not scary pretty bad story
Very bad female lead actor 😌😌😌
Man is feeble, scared of death while female actor is confident and strong. 😔
Loved it 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
In recent decades, the Earth has begun to pollute the universe with bad music, and a sound cleaning team has been sent to us. It's time to return to classical music before it's too late.
476 days 😢😢are not dead monster
Oh look, a black woman is front and center in the main image.  What a surprise!  I guess The Quiet Place creators got the memo.
IDK.. not that amazing as Quiet Place 1 and 2
Husband's must watch movie 😂
I just watched it. It sucked. Nothing really happened. We don't even know how the aliens eventually get off the island
slow...confusing...how'd she get the cat back after ambulance explosion...😢
Helluva great movie!!
1:26 Is this sound from Alien Covenant soundtrack?
I would run for apple noise cancelation gadget:)
Must of been hot garbage with how fast it went straight to digital 😂😂😂😂
Rubbish dont bother
But where is the next group which I have seen before(  the mother and her children)????
THIS FKN TRAILER IS INCREDIBLE
BOY THIS MOVIE FKN PERFECT, U MUST WATCH NO FKN CAP ❕DAM BRA-FKN-VO
Weak … 5/10
The best movie in the Quiet Place series. Top notch acting and unique protagonist development. The cat’s behavior was unrealistic though lol.
I haven’t seen this and may not ever but this reminds me of cloverfield.
Weakest one of the 3 by far
Trash Trash Trash
Я так ждала
wack ash
Shittest movie i have ever seen in my life wasted 1.5 hours on nothing
Crap.
So Boring...
Best actor in it is the cat 🐈
1:00 Wow, those are Su-27's... They're Russian!
The cat is an amazing actor as well. She knows how to be quiet😂❤❤
Trash 🗑️
This film is bullshit. I liked the first one. How can the cat not react to these creatures? How did the letter not get wet?
Not a spoiler*  If youre like me, don't worry. You can watch the movie. The cat LIVES.
The cat and the pizza make the movie even more unrealistic.
Dang shon, des som Wesley snipes black!
Aww the cat 😢
The first two “Quiet Place” movies were awesome.  This one was nothing but Hollywood woke garbage.  Was a total waste of money and time.
I hated she died at the end 😢
Just one question. In such situation, what can be done if a person snores while sleeping and uncontrolled fart?
Now That's how you do a trailer!
Quiet Place 1 & 2 is waaaayyy better than this black quiet place
Expected more. It looks like the story is more about the main character than the creatures. Very disappointed
Farting is a deadly action.
Dam I missed this in Theaters
my only complaint was it wasnt long enough
Saw it, it's not worth watching it guys. Better rewatch the first and second one
Don't give away the cat 🥺😭😢😱😰
This movie was trash 👎🏾
Its silly how thease Aliens can hear quietest voices but cant hear load footsteps that even human could hear hundreds of meters away
Don't waste your time.  It's just a stupid movie about a dying lady trying to save her cat from aliens.  I wish there was a drug that could erase the memory of ever watching this POS in a theater.
PAL lobi por no eser silencio 🤫
Ya la quiero ver
I can't believe they had a sick and weak black woman cuddling and taking care of an effeminate white boy instead of him to grow a pair and save the day. I hate Hollywood.
10/10
If you liked the first and second one, is it worth the watch? Sure  Do you learn anything about the origins of the creatures? No  Does the cat meow once? No  Do we learn anything new? No  Definitely my least favorite of the three, the beginning was OK but definitely dragged on. The guy that washes up out of nowhere makes no sense and overall I was left wanting more.
a quiet place: the quest for pizza
Just watched it yesterday. Hmmmm....still far better the 1st and 2nd imo, but...Lupita acting for anxiety and fear is remarkable.
A really silly movie...and couldnt resist the Whyte powder / soot all over the Black woman's face...a racial trope from the Silent Era.  And of course, Samira / Nyong'o's got a Fentanyl issue.
🤫😧😦😲🤐🥵
The black lead ruined it for me, spoiled by the Emily Blount lead.
Horrible movie. Horrible. HORRIBLE
This movie sucked compared to the other two. More like a love romance rather than a horror/thriller with a ton of dull boring scenes. They dropped the ball big time on this one!
No heroic teenagers and school love drama crap. I am sooo in
Rent for $20? ...nope !
The first time my cat saw the monsters, he would scratch my face and run away, never to return. That would be better since my cat is not mute, not like the one in this movie.
A movie about a pizza slice in NY.
A Quiet Place: Day One It was presented in a very simple way but the climax was also not that satisfying, the intensity of tension was not felt at all, #flop Prequel movie👎👎 part 1 and 2 are the best
What a pants follow on. Starvin Marvin and a cat. Don't waste your cash!
The whole movie was about cat lifes matter 😂
Quiet Place: Black Lives Matter  I did not watch the one with Cillian, and I'm not watching this. No John Krasinski no Quiet Place.
A little disappointed at this movie. I was looking forward to it so much but didn't get so thrilled while watching it like how i felt with the first two. This one's kinda boring and didn't give me goosebumps at all.
what if i snoring while sleeping
Let nobody lie to you...This movie is bullshit
Trash movie. I wouldn’t recommend it. Pizza and the Cat?!!!!! Smh. Wasted the other 2 movies on this movie
i just hate cast.. movie is great..
WHO WISH FOR THIS MONSTERS IN THIS REAL WORLD ? IS IT SAVE OUR MOTHER EARTH 🌎 AGAIN ?
I truly feel bad for Joseph Quinn and Lupita Nyong'o. They had to carry the entire film, with close to absolute silent acting. And Michael Sarnoski (not John Krasinski for some reason) couldn't even do a decent job at directing. It's like watching a high-budget student film. The editing is poor, the cinematography is poor, the plot has potential......but the overall way the story is told is poor. 2/10
Everytime i watch these movies all i can think it's every dog owner worst nightmare..
6.5/10 imdb, thank me later
1928 months 13,496 Days 📅📆🗓️
This is your typical false advertising trailer. Leads you to believe you'll see a much bigger scale, more action packed version of the first two. What you got is the EXACT same type of movie as the first two, but with the odd scene of the monsters running in a herd to make it look 'bigger'. To make matters worse, it even made it smaller in scale by focusing on a melodrama of a dying woman at the end of her life. Not the big budget Coverfield or Independence Day movie you're led to see.
I don’t really see the significance in the premises of these movies.  Be quiet when there’s a monster around?  That’s not really unique, I think everyone would already do that.
They know we are the chosen seed of Jacob and the Messiah is returning in his glorious form with the heavenly host to free us from this wicked captivity
Don't watch.....it has no story. Total waste of time and money
This was the worst Quiet Place movie. It was nothing like 1& 2.
Part 1 and 2 was much better than this one... I was hating that lady and her cat from the beginning...! 😡
I was really looking forward to this movie after the last one, was very disappointed, it was drawn out in several places, could have been so much better
Im done watching this movie
Grandioso... Forza napoli sempre 😍😍🥰🤯
why would someone pull u out from under the car just to say “Help me”? 😂😂  Eric is about to faint in the underground water and on the beach. But bravely rescues a cat from above in the den of monster. 😂😂
Another big disappointment.......
Just got done watching it. Let’s just say the ending was beautiful 🥹❤️🥹 great movie , we loved it ‼️
First time I've seen a mute cat, impressive.
Made my cry and few jumpscare. My heart for emotional
what a waste of time
I watched this movie in 10 minutes on my mobile phone. It was still time waste.
WOW...the comments are really trashing this movie...Thanks for the info...im OUT!
Lupita is named Sam and her cat Frodo! Cute!
Very awfull movie, dont waste time guys!
Worst movie i have ever watched... Truly wasted my 2 hours over a complete flop movie. Lead actress and director are mentally disturbed. I wish us will charge them with suitable laws.
Always these monster aliens, how could they even build spaceships 🤔
Just finished watching A quiet place day one..  it's ok but the first 2 were definitely better.
DEI.
Boring af
Nice African movie but i think us citizens are bit out of context
Has no potential....basic story...2 out of 5....No match with is it's old sequel...😤
Pretty dumb movie. So many whys
Worth to watch,,, really
1:09 : If those Aliens do not like noise .. why are they making so much of it ? ... Dumb scenario, those people got no new idea to show on cinema, its pretty pathetic.
I love  Lupita Nyong'o and this movie was awesome and beautiful, and Joseph Quinn from Stranger Things did such a awesome job
Le peu qu'il y a à voir est dans la bande annonce ! complètement nul ce film, quand je pense à certains qui ont dépensés de l'argent pour le regarder au cinéma, j'en ai mal au ventre !
So boring
SO BORING!
Waiting 2
Not worth it. No storyline, worse than the first 2. Developing weapons to fight against the monster should have been more interesting.
A Quiet Place:The Pizza, a rubbish movie directed by pizza guy
You’re far away from Kent lad 😅
The first parts of movies are always great and then the garbage starts piling up, this part not bad
this was the best out of the 3! i have watched it several times.
The oneness and humanity in this flick is beautiful❤
Prophet Hanna media impacts
Boooooring
I had no idea that Reuben was played by Alex Wolff until the credits. Dude looks unrecognizable with that beard. Nice surprise in a sub-par movie.
Another bad alien movie. No thanks.
Man the ending of this is sad 😢 in the end, Sam became complete after she accepted her fate and saved Eric
I thought this part will give us more answers and information about the creatures, or it will continue the story of the mother in part ii, but it was about “how to get pizza after apocalypse”
How many A quiet place movies are there?
Y’all overreacting, this movie wasn’t even bad fr
Main character was very unlikable
so odd how the first scene in the trailer was not in the movie at all.
Boring movie
Black woman strong helping weak white men. 😂 woke shut it off after 50% of the movie
What’s with all the black people in the film, I’m about to turn it off. The white people everywhere looking for help from the black people hilarious!!!!! This movie is propaganda
I won't watch this alone😮
Ruined the movie by putting a black person in the lead.
ima watch this no cap
Worse movie
I was worrying about one thing and that was about cat so happy that cat survived.
Hi there. I just have one question. Are all movies terrible on purpose these days or is it just a weird coincidence? Just watched this one and I'd like my money back please. Also, pretty sure that the positive comments here are paid "bot" people. Please donate money to starving children instead of wasting it on these horrors. Horrors of bad cinema that is.
Quiet. Means we don't need subtitles to watch this😅
This is onBitchute.......shhh don't tell anybody 🤫
1 n 2 is better
If you want to see what people really think hit sort by newest. All real or negative comments get pushed to the bottom of the comments section by Youtube.
RUBBISH
The first two movies were amazing and it kept me on the edge of my seat! This one unfortunately didn't have the right stuff. It kind of dragged on with two characters getting pizza before separating. Same old.. keep quiet, move silently, carefully and don't get eaten... only with two different characters. It would've been nice if they worked on how the military and citizens worked together to create a weapon and fight against the aliens which is really formidable.
Is that the same actress that played the role of black panther sister???
Garbage. and the positive comments sound like they were generated by A.I. and or bots. Meaningless woke rubbish.
next movie a quite place, make a war between alien and soldiers...
The first Two I could watch more then once..This one,once was more than enough 🙄
Trust me guys....this version of quite place is booring comparing to the other 2 movies ..💩
tf she wants pizza that bad for it’s annoying !!
NAH!!!!! The worst part from A Quiet Place franchise  SAD!!
Weird stupid movie, girl randomly wants pizza while random guy wants to randomly follow her to get pizza while all the monsters are out hunting couldnt even finish after the poem while they randomly scream
Best trailer so far. No clue, just suspense causing me to watch it.
Great flick. Hated to see Patsey in Hospice. 😆
Gem 💎
a quiet place suddenly became the apocalypse😂😅
Terrible movie. I fell asleep so many. Extremely boring.
Easily the worst movie I've seen, ur telling me the whole movie could have been avoided if they didn't want pizza? they left there cat to go get pizza, childish movie, like actually cringe to the point I didn't wanna finish it
An ultimate scouting food in the kitchen at night experience.
Garbage 🗑️ low budget actors 😂
This part is awful didnt like it at all..to me a big big mistake...
Movie was ehh. . . not understanding why she made that decision at the end, makes no sense 🫤
Rsrs.. O Biden poderia ser mais igual,menos hiperativo
I wonder if the cat will be okay
I wonder if the cat will be okay
What a waste of time.... The whole movie can fit into a little story (flashback) but they choose to ruin everything   It can be something else  It can be new ways to fight  Or war against them but here we are with someone psycho who wants to eat pizza in the middle of the apocalypse
This is a worst movie😢. Like as a video game! Why are recent Hollywood releases so bad? What happened? A Quiet place first 2 parts are awsome movies.
I just saw this... Amazing love story, the Englishman with autism plays the part so well
When all the chaos breaks out they don't show any of the slaughter scenes just people getting dragged away
Wery weak move. Stupid Fiction - new genre which is, more or less, standard now. No one thinks in terms of science, physics, rational reasoning any more. People are presented as a flock of sheep. And saving a fn cat is the most important aspect.
First two parts were far better than this one . This sequel is not interesting the fun part is the girl was crying for pizza 🤣🤣🤣 her last wish was to have pizza rather than saving her life by going to the other end where she can get whatever she wanted
Just saw the movie and it was trash. Basically a love story and they risk their loves for a cat that always runs off. It is a night and day difference in these two movies and it is pretty boring. Too much talking and very little action and the jump scenes are pretty bad.
World War Z vipes
Rubbish
Worst film I've ever watched.
This may have been the worst movie I have ever seen....
It's like plague seeker
Can't believe they managed to make a woman stay quiet for almost 90 minutes.
Boring AF...
horseshit
The cat was my favorite character 😅
So disappointed. I'm now building a time machine to get my 1hr39mins back...
I was watch it I like it😊😮😢
They will be here. This is no game. The rules of engagement between light and dark is that dark has to tell you through movies, music, or whatever medium what is about to take place. Get your end times blueprint here #TMVPB
This was prophesied. This is not entertainment but the future of America. #TMVPB
After watching this move the last thing i want is being with a feminist and  they them from US 😂
4.5/10 .
Any Kenyan 🇰🇪, let's leave like for our own lupita
Boooooo! I was expecting something more interesting but they based the story on someone who was completely irrelevant from the point of view of the beginning of a global tragedy related to creatures from space.
The whole world's ending and this woman wants to eat pizza...i dont blame the creatures for attacking humans.
Pizza Commercial
Ok but did the cat survived?
it was so so so lame, I fell asleep 5 times. this absolutly nothing happening in this film.
It be the mouth breathing for me, gets me all frustrated
but monster sounds are nothing new its boring
Watched this. It was actually massively disappointing 🤷‍♀️
worst movie🤮of Quiet Place series
Is it day one or the DEI one?
One of the worst movies I Eva seen
There's so many white people in the trailer where did they all go in the movie? 😅
Watching this rn phew im excited
Worse movie ever waist of time watching it
They need to make tv show like the walking dead...wher people are fighting other clans for food weapons and aliens it would be awsome like if you agree
Im always hungry and my stomache noises would be the death of me, day one lol
I'm like "where is the cat" in every scene.
I love how they start the movie from end to beginning with how everything started. Like the synopsis is backwards. Dope love this movie series.
I’d be dead in the first 24hours cause they would hear is the burble from my bong
Movie wz boring no original actors frm the otha 2 films🤦‍♂️
This movie sucked.
flash back 🔥
Absolute crap from start to finish are they for real waste of money making this movie it failed joke.
A study in modern mainstream anti-white racism.
I don't care about the average scores or the flatter opinions about this movie. The CAT is as epic as it gets, i never seen a cat so oddly yet, somehow perfectly cast in this way. Not once could i discern the cat being out of its element, it was certainly catified, wasn't messin, revered by ancient Egyptians, cats rule,  dogs have owners and cats have staff, and tomorrow is Caturday. And remember, taco-cat backwards, is still taco-cat. Let me just finish here and say, this is cat stuff right alright, don't be messing around to think otherwise.
For those whos seen it:          Did anyone else only care if the cat was ok?
well this film was a waste of time. only the action scenes kept me awake. poorly written
the worst movie ever the plot was sooo booring
If the cat doesn't survive i'm not watching.
I’m watching this with my mom today 🙌🏻😎 wish us luck guys 🥲!
dont watch this movie. its a low budjet one. i hate it.....
Best Movie ❤❤❤
My roommate won't survive if this happens she's clumsy 😅
So boringggg
It's just super meh. This concept of monsters is cool, but the plot is so boring, main two characters - acceptable performance. This is modern cinema in a nutshell. Mediocre at best.
What if you had to fart?
Garbage movie
Absolutely fantastic on all parts! Wow
Great movie :) especially on cinema
For some reason the movie is streaming in a website in a hd
Terribly woke!!!! Black cat lady showcased as strong, warrior-like, independent, while the white male is weak, fumbling and bubling, scared and  dependent. Typical new era terrible Hollywood garbage. Unrealistic!!!
looks awesome...
don't waste your time with this movie, where one cat is more important than people...nonsense...😑
That's the a trailer shpuld be made...ex. a a little taste of the movie.
Wow Audio 👌
pizza cat quest 2024 bad movie
Couldn't they find a better actress who's White, beautiful woman?
You can consider lowering the volume next time before you lower the volume please TY.
Okay time for the radical blacks to take over a franchise made successful by white actors.
Cast a women in the movie named "a quiet place" 😂😂😂😂
Oh. My. Gawd. And it's on at the DRIVE-INN!!! 😮
just saw it. I give it 2/5. It was more about Lupita's character's last day than day one of carnage & survival. And Djimon's chracter  should have been given wayyyy more screen time
Starting in New York is probably the worst place possible in noise sensitive alien invasion
Worst movie ever . Sucked …
Bad movie
The person who designed this trailer deserves a salary increase.. One of the most beautiful trailers I have seen!
Totally overrated- don't waste your time and money
this  movie was boring it was like a low budget a quiet place
bro I guess you forgot about the monster in a movie " " a quiet place " " , please make video on them
It was decent. Too quite and the cat is irritating
It’s giving stranger things
I fell asleep. Now I could blame the comfy recliner chairs but genuinely was disappointed. I didn't watch the first ones but I've done that before and still enjoyed films, so I don't think it was that either. Not my thing
Looks AWFUL - yet another movie to trigger anxiety and paranoia, great. That’s all humanity needs right now. Read the room — please
First 2 were better. The whole plot of this one was all about them getting pizza and a dumb cat.
This one compared with the first 2 is GARBAGE🗑️
I haven't seen too many bad movies, however, this was the worst.
The quiet place aliens have no reproductive organs visible on their designs hinting towards either an asexual reproduction method or no reproduction method. Regardless the aliens are screwed in the long run
The dumbest Hollywood movie award!!!
👍👍👍
If you like ugly actresses with attitudes, she will do it for you.
Please bring Cillian Murphy back into the film
0:41 they have sharp hands
Is amilea here
why would 'nt they make this a series ,It has a perfect story
worst movie to ever be filmed !!! do not watch..
Fking nonsense boring prequel. I have come to watch alien vs human terror movie, instead you gave me literary film?!
❤❤❤i just saw the name "LUPITA" and i was like its a must watch
Jim really broke up with Pam that’s why the world ended
This movie was really boring don't waste your money.
This creatures have so many weaknesses but they still can't be stopped they can't fly , can't swim, can't see ,can hear the smallest of sond you can just blind them with high frequency sound
I arrived at the theater to buy tickets only to find out that the entire theater was sold out and I had no choice but to sit in the very front row. Waste of money because not even halfway through the movie everybody left. It was so boring do not waste your money!!!
Hated it. It was so boring 😐
Just like the other one keeping it quite I thought it's gonna be a story of the monster where they came from and military solving it or the government doing research

What's happening with Hollywood movies??? Just garbage. Streaming services are why better.
Your Bitcoin transfer has been processed successfully—congratulations!
The music is awesome
Very boring movie save your time and money.   You will get as much exposition to the world in this trailer as you will in the whole movie. The characters lack depth and the plot is only moved forward by the miraculous and silent cat.
I enjoyed this a lot more than the first two installments. 😊
This Dudes must have a great navigation system👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Fly through the galaxy and build awesome spaceships. And all without EYES! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Just watched the movie, not that great like the country one, the aliens simply sprawl all over like a bunch of cicadas killing the thrill! And the cat is so matured it wouldn’t meow even once weird 😕
Waw🎃
I saw this movie today and I really liked it!
Worst part of the series don't recommended for anyone nothing scary at all  I watched part 1 and 2 and they were a masterpiece but this one looks like crap 😢😢
All the hollywood interns trying to shill this movie so hard.
Ugh another dei hollywood dumpster fire.
Haven’t seen it. I don’t care what happens, but if that cat dies, we sue hollywood
what’s gonna happen if people don’t mind their business and stfu
Watched this today, what a load of rubbish. None of the suspense of the other 2. One one from the previous 2 films are in this. Terrible film!
This cat is a paid actress/actor  She or he is so calm and cute So quiet thru out this movie
What a disappointing movie for this franchise.
The cat was totally unrealistic.  Cats don't like water, and last I checked, they meow.  Lol.
it’s an ok movie, i liked it but part 1 and 2 are better imo
This part is disappointing. The story feels mundane and uninspired, with too few characters and poorly executed plot developments. The horror and suspense elements are sparse and lack impact. There's a noticeable decline compared to the first installment
Hopefully Lupita doesn't make.it to the ending.
Trash 😂
Anyone that has seen it, can an 11 year old watch the movie? I’m wondering if it’s okay for a younger kid that age to watch it or not
After the deaf girl ended the aliens life with a bar, i just lost interest in this.
wished they made this in the style of the cloverfield! instead of one story of a girl who just wants pizza.....
Well, there goes this franchise.
Lupita Nyong'o and her cat better survive because they're cute AF.
Shhhhh
can those aliens be tamed?
I WAS SO EXCITED just watched it  biggest DISAPPOINTMENT SO BORING the first 15-20 min is ok with some Action then it turns to a 45 min touchy story between two people it’s extremely boring   Part one and two are way better
I expected an in-depth backstory on the Alien invasion, not a sappy tale about a girl’s existential crisis. The focus bizarrely shifted to her soothing journey post-disease diagnosis amidst chaos. The unnecessary attempts to shoehorn the cat into the plot were laughably insane – it should’ve been dead or lost a dozen times over. The whole thing was wildly misleading based on these trailers. Sure, the performances and story had their moments, and the Alien close-ups were decent, but this film was far from what I wanted. 5 out of 10.
IS THERE AMELIA AND THOMAS??
Totally waste of money
Did not like this movie.. Best scenes are in the trailer
Worst movie ive ever seen in my whole existing life! Period.
I just watched it at GSC
Most annoying trailer I’ve had the displeasure of witnessing at the theaters.
IF YOU WANT TO WATCH A DYING GIRL GO THROUGH A CITY OF NOISE ATTACKING MONSTERS  ALL FOR PIZZA  This is for you.
amazing movie ❤❤❤❤
It should have been about the same couple. Not different people
just a bad movie that's all...casting that whiny annoying character was worse 😂
It seems that Karens loudly demanding to speak to the manager wouldn't have lasted long.
I watched today
Sweet! Yet ANOTHER movie about the SAME thing that we've seem TWICE now with the SAME jump scares and gore! This is where we are as a society I guess. Goldfish attention spans.
fortunately, she's was black enough for that role.
alright can we cancel for doing white face? lol probably not... seems about right lol
Terrible movie
The worst quiet place franchise movie ever.
do not like the main I assume female actor in this movie !!!!!
Doesn’t make sense these creature type aliens. And they able to engineer and fight the way they do. Hard to believe.
How is this pg-13
Saw the movie today and the cat died, sorry guys
It's like they keep recycling the same old same old....
I watched the film today and let me tell you how loud it was that it even scared me and my sister it's was like a jumpscare but I cried in the end because she got want she wanted and he got want he wanted
Can't they just build armor plated turrets  with PA systems to lure them in and un-aliving them with high caliber and capacity pews?? 🤷‍♂️
Dont waste ur money. This movie sucked
They used the noise from Alien Covenent.
Finally watched this tonight and it is a total let down compared to the other two. Another gone woke movie putting a black female actress and other actors with no acting skills at all. Then fill the movie with stupid little scenario's with men making noise and one desperately follows her and the cat which plays no relevance in the movie at all like I was expecting. Seriously if your life was in that much danger, you would not be worrying about a cat that already risked your life making a noise. John Krasinski ruined another great serious and this is guaranteed to flop. Second week at the Cinemas and it was dead empty. Horrible casting. Stupid cheap jump scare scenes. I'm sure this is going to ruin a next one being made. Stick to Emily Blunt and the kids and go back to 1 and 2 style of scenes and quality acting.
Oh dear, it appears a system error caused the transaction to stray to an invalid email!
Movie was horrible tbh
This movie is commercial for 🍕 what a waste of time and money's stupid editors
Didn't watch it but I gotta ask, is everyone that snores dead in this movie?
Schnitzel and Nico should get an Oscar! (the 2 cats used in this movie)
This is the worst movie I've ever seen.  Sucks worse than a Disney starwars update.  What did I just watch?
Thought this was a natural disaster movie. Another movie with weird species attacking humans no thanks
Wait is princess Amelia in this movie?
My thing is, how you gonna crash land on my planet and tell me to be quiet 😂
Went to see this...and just as I figured, it was TRASH!  All the monster scenes we see in the trailer, and are pretty much all the scenes we see in the movie!  The rest is ZZZZZZZZZZZZ  BOOORING TRASH!
I liked part two much better than this. You get to see these things up close in action within the town at the start and what the family has to do to survive
CERN opened the gates...😊
At 1:01 those fighter aircraft are russian.
It’s so borning, don’t waste ur time nor money, I don’t recommend it
After the first movie which was total crap I won't be paying another small fortune at the cinema on this effort .
全作みた
I can see why people didn't like it .But I enjoyed, only thing disappointed we didn't see any military or police fight back
According to the washington post review, the white male character is so scared and clueless that he follows the dying black female character on her mission to try to obtain a stale old piece of pizza.
Not worth it, horrible movie- don’t waste your time. Very boring.
Was too boring tbh
There is a cat at risk? I cant watch it.
not me editing myself into this trailer 👀👀
Horrible movie. I was upset I wasted my time/money. First 2 were perfect
😴
Even Amelia was there💀💀💀💀
Why does this movie have such horrible reviews
I didnt like it 😮
Just saw this movie it was so scary definitely can see this happening in the future
Guess if you get a cough due to cold youre screwed.
Најгори филм икад!!!!!!!!!!!! Нек се режисер запита да ли је изабрао праву професију јебем га уста
The biggest waste of money & my time….
Don't watch it, soooo disappointed

Going to the theaters today to see it, I'm so excited!  When I was looking up on the movie I seen my favorite actor! U probably know who I'm talking about . JOSEPH QUINN!
Ignore the negative comments. Notice they all say the same exact thing from different faceless profiles? Incel, obsessed racists who make it a point to comment on anything that shows people of color and hate. The movie was great. It reminded me A LOT of early 2000 horror produced movies, when they were well edited, well acted out and entertaining. All in all, I'd rate it a 7.5
1:06 this scene looks similar to the opening scene of aespas song Armageddon
I'm pretty sure at this point that these movies are genuinely trying to prepare us for what is to come.
Don’t watch this movie it was really bad I fell asleep watching. I should’ve been paid to watch this😊
Don’t watch this movie it was really bad I fell asleep watching. I should’ve been paid to watch this
Very short movie.
After reading all the negative comments I was iffy about it, but it was too late. I already got the tickets. It wasn't awful, but not the greatest. Keep in mind, this wasn't written by the same writer for 1&2. I did go into a semi sleep state, but that was due to me being sleepy already. Also doesn't help that it was pretty quiet too. All in all, it was still entertaining.
about to watch this in an hour yeyy  update- i enjoyed it!! i can definitely see why people didn't like it though, my mom didn't. it was a bit boring and slow at times, but overall i would watch it again. tbh it's not necessary to watch in theatres but i don't regret it‼️ (+ i dont think it deserves all the ppl in the comments saying it was terrible, they're being over dramatic Imao)
This was very disappointed I don’t recommend you watching it unless you wanna watch a black girl go out of her way to get pizza and her cat that somehow doesn’t make a noise.
A fantastic movie!!!  I just saw it today.  I was tense and jumpy throughout the whole movie.  Lupita is an amazing actress but the cat "Frodo" would take all the awards, in my opinion.  I already want to watch it again.  I highly recommend it.
I love a quiet place
Save your money. Not worth watching trust me.
I thought he was dead from part 2?
I guess I'm just getting old better to rent these movies instead of sitting in  the theater
The worst movie. I had never thought that i would fall asleep in a thriller horror movie 😅
Don't waste your time
watching the movie for the cat
Boring movie 5/10
Meh
Imagine there was a subtle comedic scene where you see a resident agitated over an inconsiderate upstairs neighbour until there’s finally peace & quiet after they got attacked by the aliens
What if someone farted? 👀
Next: a quiet place: before day 1
It seems like I'm missing something, it seems like a lot of people liked this movie. I'm a big fan and I loved the first 2 movies. But I fell asleep while watching this one. Won't give any spoilers but I was really hoping for more when I read day one.
Tried to watch this today, but a group of 4 black guys literally made it unbearable. THEY WERE SO FREAKIN LOUD DURING THE ENTIRE MOVIE. Why are these groups of people so loud. Restaurants, stores, movie theaters. Ffs.
Not sure if I can handle the kitty ! Poor kitty!
Clover field vibes
watched the movie, don’t worry the cat survived
Stop with making aliens look like savages
Day one, saving cat !! Cat run away!! Saving cat!! Cat cat cat!!!!!!!! People saving her cat!! Al about cat!!
I’m seeing this movie friday wish me luck😭
I'm watching this already in SM Cinema in SM City Fairview today from 4:15 pm to 5:20 pm
This movie is like the first one - boring and time wasting , i didnt enjoy it at all ,me and a friend went to the cinema to watch it ,and after 45 min. we left ....
It's the worst movie!!!
this movie is super boring and zero storyline makes it worst. I have been waiting for 3 years to see this part and it really disappointed me  All they care about was pizza  This part was not even 1% related to 1st and the 2nd one   NOT RECOMMENDED ❌
1 scene is missing and another one has been changed in the final cut.   0:56 : Hospital scene is missing 1:11 : This scene has been heavily edited. Instead of Djimon's character, they swapped him with the nurse guy and the sequences are also different. It's a big shame because this version is better and has more impact than the current one. smh
Advice for best experience , quiet room , active dts or dolby atmos surround speaker or headset , bluray quality , off lamp and enjoy watching ☠️
Lame? Please make something different?
Only people who saw this on June 28th its opening day can like this
This movie sucked....everyone running for there life and this woman spends the entire movie just wanting to get some pizza at a restaurant she likes
This movie was so fkn bad wow
These comments are obviously bots. This is the worst movie I’ve seen in a long time. I actually watched it!  I was hoping the 3x I actually saw the monsters that the monsters won
I couldn't believe how BAD this movie was!
Trash, boring and short
Dont watch this movie. It is very bad!! 2/10. Watched this in cinema today
just watched it. so awfully terrible 😞
movie sucked
And the Oscar goes to the Cat.He had an entire role to play in this movie😊
i mean the movies are fun but i dont understand how the military didn't figure out that they go after noise. that seems like a big weakness, also they do not seem to be able to fly either
She looks like of one Kony’s kids 😂
Oh boy!! Another strong female feminist lead. Another garbage fire.
My snoring ends me
Long live the introverts 🙏😬
Ok so we just watched it lastnight.    It was alright.       I had to keep being reminded, it wasent #3 it was a view from how it started.     So from both views,   if it was #3 it was boring and more about her.  My view from "day one" of a view from they started.     It was helpful to understand how  they came about.     It started off loud and with a slow story of life just living.    Then it got really became a suspense scary thriller then BaaaaM!  It got boring again and then over.     Its like they ran out of ideas.
Can I be able to enjoy this third part of the trilogy without having seen the first two?
Finally I get to see Djimon Hounsou behind the screen again. Such a legendary actor!!
Watch the last one so sad ending 😢
After seeing the first two, it was hard for me to see the third one, which is much weaker for easy to understand reasons.
Ilyen rossz filmet még nem láttam
Moc se mi to líbilo, jsem rád  😮😮😮😅😅😅
More perverse propaganda to demonise alien civilizations. They are not & have never been a threat. Human Military Psychopaths are. They’ve killed hundreds of millions of us https://youtu.be/5C_-HLD21hA?si=nZd47IlX7cIBom2P
Save your money, this movie is garbage….
This movie was my least favorite. Wth happened??
Movies are getting shittier and shittier.
Of course the blacks need to ruin another great movie
Loved 1 and 2. Third movie sucked hard. Had 3 actors. Co Main was a cat. 3rd guy Djimon Hounsou who helped sell me to go see the movie had 2 parts less than 5 seconds each. Could not be more misleading. Showed creatures very little and even then it was like silhouettes to chump out farther. Big let down. Save your money.
This one does not live up to anywhere near the first two films. It does have great acting but very slow. Not what I was expecting!
THIS MOVIE SUCKED, it bored  us to tears, answers no questions and basically nothing happens. Don’t fall for  the media campaign. Oh and yea, the cat makes it after using up all 9 lives about 15 times.
The cat (frodow) is the stabilizer of our heart rates just saying😅😅😅😜😤
I think this is a downgrade compared to first and second franchise. I was like at the end, ‘that was it?’
Movie was the best sleep I ever had
Imagine this happens to you and then you see CR7 and either you yall or hit the SIUUU🎉😂
The movie sucks...thank you
I wonder if they could actually harm the extraterrestrials with extremely loud noises like with venom.
WORST EVER MOVIE .....doesn't deserve a star....sorry.
The cat was the Mvp of this movie
sheer horror brilliance tho
Snooze fest. It does not have the same intensity and suspense as the first two.
Very interesting
That was a disappointing movie.
not believable all at once no..could be gradual
The one typenof people that DO NOT know how to be quiet: New Yorkers 😂
One of the most iconic movie show I ever saw🎉
Sounds very interesting movie
Guys did you know princess Amelia is there??
There's something deeply humorous about a movie about aliens that hunt noisy people featuring a cast like that 😭
Just watched it. The emotional side of this story is equally magnificent. Lupita- this woman so far never fails.
Michael Sarnoski should feel ashamed to call himself a filmmaker, and John Krasinski should've retired from his mediocre acting career while he was ahead. They undoubtedly tainted the reputation of Lupita Nyong'o, who performed well considering the lack of dialogue and poorly executed scenes. Countless dramatic events simply fell of the page, much like a fragmented dream that leave you confused. The entire plot was centered around Lupita Nyong'o having a terminal illness, and her pursuit for a slice of nostalgic pizza before she passes. The emotional tension surrounding her terminal illness was the only meaningful part of the plot, and they used it the entire movie to create suspense, along with her emotional support cat who seemed to have as many individual scenes as the main actors. I'm not exaggerating, this cat deserves an award for best supporting actor!! Meanwhile, the city was being attacked by mysterious creatures that lack any motive, even though their destructive mission seems to be deliberate. Fight scenes are exaggerated with poorly timed explosions, disoriented chaos, and near misses that skip to new scenes without any linear development. Spoiler Alert!! In the end, Lupita heroically sacrifices herself for an English bloke who followed her around the entire movie because he was crippled with anxiety and was inspired by the CAT! I could go on for pages, but I think you get the point. Please, please, please, DO NOT SUPPORT HOLLYWOOD when they spend 60 million dollars and produce trash. Otherwise, there might be a third bombshell. Let this be a lesson!
in utter disbelief seeing so many great reviews because i mean if we’re being completely honest the film was painfully mediocre in comparison to the first 2 films! i’m genuinely disappointed and baffled at how bad , predictable , meaningless the entire movie was … NOTHING HAD ORIGIN , there is so many missing pieces it’s not even funny !!!! after all this time you would think they would come correct with this one smfh wow highly disappointed 🚮
For someone that LOVED the 1st and 2nd installment, this 1 disappointed, majorly, for me. I'll keep re-watching the 1st 2 from now I see...sigh...
I've already seen it, it was a disappointment, 90% drama, 10% horror, suspense and action. 👎🏻  The protagonist's transcendental purpose is "I want a pizza", that's the whole movie.
Movie sucked lol
boring movie
Movie sucked,
“But in those days, following that distress, “’the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.” Mark 13:24-26   They wrote out the part where Jesus comes to rescue HIS children. They just show you the gruesome parts.   It’s going to be crazy when people realize those aren’t Starlink satellites falling from the sky. Lmbo Satan thinks he’s so clever to cover up the stars falling from the sky. It’s already happening. The media is a lie. But yet they place the truth in the “entertainment.” This is about to happen in real time/real life! Jesus is coming! And the masses will be deceived into thinking millions disappeared without a trace bc of some alien abduction. Haha partly true, Jesus is an “alien” and he is sent to rescue those who are found with faith from the end of all things.   This movie is the book of Revelation on CRACK! Are you ready???
Watching this while I have a bad cough is even scarier 😢 just imagine
This movie sucked I do NOT recommend watching it it is a waste of money it isnt even scary it is so BAD
The monsters look  like  the oned from alien
So thiscis number three  that they  had  done  pretty cool man I wonder if they might do number four
This was terrible I was so hype
The movie sucked lol
Just watched all three movies with my grandma, poor thing, she said she’ll need therapy after watching them 🙃
I see we are checking off all the ESG boxes here.
It’s a movie about pizzas
hi
They don’t show the cat enough in this trailer
I left about halfway through..maybe I'll pick it back up when streaming. It was hard to care about the characters. The first one had a family who had lost one of their own so you cared more. The second one was kind of meh though yea she lost yet again. This one though..no real interest other than her condition. We already know what the aliens can do. I guess it happening in the city is different.
Guys get It it's like a service cat
I talk in my sleep RIP ME
This movie sucks so bad.
I don't like it 🤮🤮🤮 dont make any movie in future 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
This movie had so many plot holes  it was almost unwatchable. Thank goodness I only spent $11 on the matinee.
Why the scene on 1:13 did not show in cinema
I’m tryna convince my brother to see this with me
I feel like they would be affected by frequencies. It was a really smart decision.
Fauci did it
Horrible let down of a movie. Went to the theater tonight to see it. I was extremely disappointed. 👎🏼

I saw this movie today.. it was in my opinion horrible and I loved the first 2
Part 1 & 2 were great but this new one is a redbox
Glad I didn't have to pay to see it! Geesh....talk about dropping the ball again! The concept is there for a helluva movie but they can never deliver. The 1st one was the best! Still can't compete with "The Tomorrow War" movie!
شوكت ينعرض
Why didn't they attack their own aliens for making noise too?
They just copied the book of revelation and put their own spin on it 😂😂😂😂 it’s so easy to see
They just copied the book of revelation and put their own spin on it 😂😂😂😂 it’s so easy to see
Went to the movies after years of taking a break (nothing worth watching) and I LOVED the experience ! Really nice movie :D
this movies has to be like many others POLITICALY "correct" ;)) just trash!
Opening scene reminds me of the meteor shower from 'Armegeddon'
going to watch this just for Joseph 🥳
Looks awful like every other trailer I've seen today.
I wanna see a Half Life movie
Finally
Tempat yang tenang pada hari pertama
I literally walked out of 4DX Cinema because it was too boring
A quiet place: Me and John has to protect the kids A quiet place 2: Me and Cillian Murphy has to protect the kids A quiet place: Day one: Boo hoo me sad me get pizza
Bruh this looks so lit

Blacks rejoice

Easiest way to survive is an underground bunker.
That noise that we here for most of the trailer was used in one of the alien movies
Kung dito sa pinas mangyayari yan  tegi kagad ako. Madalas akong ubuhin🥲
Discovering extra-terrestrial life wouldn't necessarily work out well for the natives, especially if there's a sizable gap between the species. If the aliens are sufficiently advanced to travel the vast distances in interstellar space, with such a possibility, would they choose to enslave humanity or see us as livestock?  A Quiet Place series is predicated on the theory the aliens are predacious and can't be reasoned with.
😨
Worst movie I have seen in my life
Has to be one of the stupidest movie series i have ever seen
The Over-Concept: KEY WORD " Suicidal " a constant reinforcement of American Mental Capacity...
I liked the first two more. This one is more of a drama.
Call this a boring place
imagine snoring
I hate it 🤢🤢🤮
We still don’t know why tbh 😂 but the movie was amazing !!
I don't know why they put the music from alien covenant when they don't have the right to use it but it ads up to the suspend :).
This movie has lost all the quality the first two had. Really boring.
I wish chaos scene was a lot longer 😐
Kind of ironic that the aliens are sooooo noisy but expect us to be quiet
Mad max and quiet place day one are the best movies in a decade amazing acting by all
Guys don’t waste your money😅 it was really bad and I liked the first one! Not sure why they made this one…
Awful film, don’t waste your time.
BAD👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Been watch the part 1 no so interesting
It very sad the movie
I watched it andd why is it only 1 hour and 40 minutess?? Cant you give us like 2 and a half hour?? Want moree so much
One of my favvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvorite movie i've watched so farr
⚠️⚠️ SEMI-SPOILERS FOR THE MOVIE, SCROLL PAST IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ⚠️  Just as people complained about The Strangers Chapter 1 (I liked the movie but understand this criticism), the trailer narration text says "Discover" why our world went Quiet". This movie is served as a prequel origin story, but it's only one of those things, prequel ≠ origin
Bro where is princess Amelia
Love the irony of this movie, the noisiest city going silent, the only time New York City will ever be quiet
The monsters moved way faster in this one, in the other films the monsters were slow enough people could escape lol
Movie was a complete waste of. Don’t spend those40 dollars not including foos . Just buy weed a pizza and watch the old quiet place movies
This looks absolutely brilliant lol
Why are some parts in the trailer not in the movie
Waiting is over 😊
I am disappointed, no Emily Blunt. Where is our military forces, Tomahawk missiles, battle scenes, etc
Worst movie I’ve seen in a long time. A complete waste of money
500 days where do you get the resource to record all that?
Una copia de la gerra de los mundos ni un sentido
Just left the theater in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania the movie was terrible, 100 bad I did everything I could stay awoke, don't sit back and make a movie and completely different people is in it from one and two, who is these people, the movie didn't even make no sense, it was terrible, don't let the clips fool you the movie was horrible keep your money
dream about this
Bru don’t waste yall time…movie was booooty😂 the whole movie was basically them being chased that’s literally it bru….
I recently saw this movie at the cinema. It was amazing just like the previous released AQP movies. Now I need to re-watch them!
This movie sucked btw.
Cloverfield....On Mute
Okay!!! I'm waiting

The mute ppl laughing in the corner😂
what a bad movie. dont waste your time on this
I love the movie
Top
People who snore during sleep = RIP in Advance
did this movie have the same director as first 2 movies
the trailer was awesome but the movie wasn't.
This movie was a disappointment to the other parts.
🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🚀✨️
1:12 this scene got changed in the movie to them running past the doorway of the building
If that cat dies imma start a war
Bad movie. Cat even can silence. Diary book, shirt etc  still not get wet (or dry so quick) when they swim in the sewage tunnel.
Done watching Honest review: Too much dialogue make this movie boring 6/10 for me part 1 and part 2 is way better than this
Went to see this with my daughter, so thankful she did. I now want to own a cat 😂.
1:11 "Everybody is shuffling"
Am I the only one who liked this movie??? Why do people have to complain about everything?
Más de lo mismo
Excellent. People take heed. More conditioning for the Tribulation after the Rapture of the Church. Don't  get left behind. Aliens are demons and their on their way, in fact they're already here. You day of salvation is NOW. 1 Cor 15:1-4
The first two films were excellent.  I won't go to the current one because they made it "woke".  I can't identify with some shaven-headed Nubian.  Must they ruin everything they touch???
I usually don't review movies, but this one is the worst of the franchise. It's 1 hour and 28 min long and I don't even know why you bothered releasing it. It's kinda funny that nobody thought to use sound as weapon even though all acknowledged that these creatures can't see. Characters failed to deliver and I think it's director's issue. Movie feels low effort and budget with random scenes. Honestly I would be a better director, it had some much potential but executed poorly.
THIS MOVIE SUCKED 👎
This is one of the dumbest franchises out there and so many peaple liking it just shows how many dumb peaple is walking among us. That is what's really scary
Watched this movie this weekend. The ONLY character we actually cared about was the cat. Not impressed.
Least scariest movie in history, can't compare it to the first 2 movies
My farts would be my downfall.
I will FOREVER be grateful to the producers for FINALLY having a cat as the protagonist's ally and NOT a dog.
Trust the comments please its nothing like the trailer shows  I felt baited and scammed and its the first time it happen in 20 years of cinema  Well done for that you got me, my time and my money  Will not ever trust anyone who participate in making this shitshow
This movie was great, I loved it
STUPID FILM,, dont watch this, waste ur time
Was boring
Фильм не понравился(
Worst of the franchise...having delivered both the parts exceptionally well this was utter disappointment.
Just watched this. It was so terrible. Don’t waste your money!
found this Movie boring. i hoped for some details, where the Aliens come, what they want etc.. but nothing. 2/3 of the movies is about chasing a cat, if youre in that kind of stuff, you may like it. also its woke again.
The real start in the movie is Frodo the cat , say it loud ❤❤❤
Please close your eyes in the Opening scene, thanks.
***Spoilers about the cat and ONLY the cat in case you want to know whether he survived the movie or not***       He lives. And he’s pretty unbothered the entire time. Cat lovers, the movie is gonna make you worried about him, especially at a few choice moments, but no harm comes to him, the aliens don’t even look at him. The *only* thing I didn’t like was there was one or two times where the characters had to go underwater with him and I just didn’t like the idea of forcing a cat to hold its breath for a few moments. But you never see him in distress or even the slightest bit scared or nervous. He’s chill.
Cat survives or there will be problems.
I watched it today worst movie ever so boring i want my money back
Gonna bring my mother in law to watch this
Naur this movies peak. 8.5/10 😭😭
The most BORING and IDIOTIC movie ever, ever...
I wish they made a series and that its from the creatores of The Walkinkg Dead like if you agree please
Just watched it today, sucks and boring.
Why the part 1:13 this not show in cinema
All THE WOKE PEOPLE GOT EATEN FIRST
Lucky that her cat didn't 'meow' even once! Great visuals and monster effects, but a rather silly and laborious storyline! She had to get pizza instead of being rescued? Really?
Super  Story
Most trash movie ever quiet one 😂😂 I saw it had to fast forward so much b.s
When the woke movie critics rate a movie favorably, you know it’s going to be terrible. This was the worst movie I’ve ever seen.
Just watched this in theaters and I can honestly say this is the worst movie I’ve ever seen.   If you were expecting an action-packed, scary, apocalyptic alien invasion movie then you’re sadly mistaken. The entire movie was about a cat and pizza, I’m not even kidding. It was incredibly boring and predictable while not answering any of the audience’s questions about the aliens. I rate 1/10.
I love these types of movies
Where all the stray dogs??  Did aliens eat them for barking??  Where is the military.  A10 aircraft with 30mm armor piercing rounds - Army helicopters gunships - troops with RPGs - M1 Abrams tanks.   Politicians gave up on NYC and blew up bridges on day 1 - would have taken endless committee meetings a week/month to make that big of a decision.  Lazy writing too many plot holes.
They should have just made the movie about the cat, that would’ve made it much more interesting 😒
Just watched it, what boring movie and the main characters are built very poorly. This part of the original movie was unnecessarily needed to be made.
The other two were much better this one was pretty boring.
bad movie a flop
Compare to last ones, bad as f... Purring car, talking in the church, 5000 people in the street, and the hole movie about the pizza, just waste my  money
Movie sucked so much
Fuuuuu this movie suck
Lupita you better!!!!!
This movie was stupid. I thought we were supposed to find out what happened. We really didn’t find out anything. Trailer was very misleading I cannot believe I have seen other people talking about this….i
Haven't we all wait for that stupid cat to meeaow?
They should do aliens vs the creatures from a quiet place and see who wins
So disappointed. Nothing like the first two.  Eventually I was bored senseless and there were too many scenes that just didn’t make sense!  Plus the ridiculous whining about still getting pizza while being stalked by creatures and everyone around is dead almost made me walk out. I want my $12 and my time back.
Terrible movie!! Do not see it!!
‘Discover why our world went quiet’  not being funny but Day One doesn’t even explain anything about the creatures.  Like we know they had to be quiet cuz of them but this movie doesn’t even show how they came to find that out or any attempts to figure out why the creatures invaded their world.  Like I thought we would see the military saving a few people and them trying to figure things out while we follow Lupita’s but like tattoo didn’t happen.   I did really like this movie (super sad btw) but those are my negative.
Duhh kenapa harus ada kucing, jadi ga tega mau nonton😢
just seen this movies,so boring and wasted my money😪
Is it like Bird Box
I wanna see it but it looks like a knock off. they had a beautiful opperatunity here to bring back jim and totally blew it with this inclusive bs. another thing i hope this movie is a little louder than the other 2. 😂😂😂 almost 45 min of straight no sound
Watched this today and I am very disapppointed. I want to sleep but this movie is too loud. Not really quiet. Rating 6/10
Really loved that they included the cat (even tho he was always very pearly white clean in the mess that the city was😂) but was very anxious about him through out the movie
no thanks
Full movi kaha milega bhai
My boi Joseph Quinn getting his big movie F yeah!
The movie is very boring… I’m disappointed 😔
I can’t with her holding the cat 😢
You know. I think the only way to beat space creatures like these and others such as spikes, in the day after tomorrow is to either build colonies underwater or above the planet
I like palliative care in movies, pet therapy, Last wish, music therapy, control pain, human dignity
1:06 but i do black face and everyone friggen loses it
I saw it, the movie was awful. Nothing like the trailer suggested it would be. Very disappointed. Read the reviews before watching
The franchise went to sh!t. A N... place
This movie was not worth the hype save your money just being honest
Is this from a redit prompt?
Directors you need to show more scenes with people show us police or army or civilians battling these monsters..does anybody notice the cat  doesn't make a sound it's like cat cut the cat's tongue..lol
I seen all 3, but I am very curious, why can't they smell, or lack of it?
Boring as fk
7/10
It was so horrible
Why didn’t the cat meow is it dumb can’t it speak 🤔
Watched it last night and boy was it disappointing…. it didn’t have any thriller effects like the other two movies at all, disappointed much 😢 5/10
Just saw it…it didn’t disappoint!
This movie got me so emotional. I was crying towards the end 😭
The cat lived y'all 😂 🫶🏽
Please tell me she and the cat reunite! 😂😢😔🥺🙏
I'm down 😎
Just saw it yesterday, great movie.
Such a wasted potential, great acting but story wise BS there was no driving force that motivates the events
Show looks really cool actually
Trash wait till it’s free
My cats would’ve had me dead
Death angels: Rawr Librarians: 🤫
Soooo…. Is this a cure for snoring? Because they will all be dead within 24h 😂
It was boring
I’d gladly part ways with my unhinged cat if we were in an apocalyptic situation. Natural selection
When will it be shown?
Very excited.  Haven't been to the theater in a hot minute, but I'm going for this.  Gotta have the giant screen and surround sound to be properly terrified.
I just finished watching this awesome movie… well the cat stole the show.. great acting, great story 🎉🎉
Imagine those you know who're rarely quiet?
0:53 “discover why”. After seeing the movie, we do NOT discover why.
Can someone tell me if anything bad happens to the cat please? If so I can’t go see it 😂
What a waste of time, the world comes to an end and all they case for one hour is a flipping pizza. Trash
Going to watch this movie to make sure that cat lives.
At the theatre tonight the green & white EXIT sign looked awfully inviting !
Lady, please protect your cat at all costs!
This movie was TRASH. I'm not even usually so critical of a film. The first two movies were great. Should have waited for it to arrive on Netflix.
Just watched boring asf
Great movie with a sad ending. 👍😞
I feel many of the scenes from the trailer didnt made it into the movies
Not for me thank you
watched boring slept 10 mins in need refund
Love these movies!  Scary!!
just saw this..not very impressed. It can wait to be on Netflix
Great movie!! You feel every emotion when it’s quiet. Maybe that’s why we’re afraid of silence 😉
A minha família seria a primeira a morrer
AHHHH IM GOING TO SEE IT TODAY CANT WAIT!
1:13 That scene is not even in the movie
Sequel to Us
This movie would have been great if its a story about an introvert scientist who hates noise so badly that he created those creatures to destroy the world, what a missed opportunity.
If I don't eat anything in the movie place You know 1 thing that's not gonna  Be quiet...... my insides
That would be a nice anime too
Boring😂
I had booked the ticket and then I saw bad reviews. But still went and saw with low expectations.  Joseph Quinn , Lupita and Frodo since the movie made us connect with the chatacters immediately I was not disappointed.But They had great chance to show many things. Especially one plot in military or govt and another parallel plot what they showed in movie. It would have been great. And audience would be satisfied  This movie was still better than MI 5 dead recokhning 1 for me
Literally the worst movie Ive been to, no story, boring scenes, expected jumpscares
I did watch this movie yesterday. I give 4/10 only. 1st and 2nd movie are much better.
Yo this movie sucked.
It would be nice if this franchise was turned into a series “A quiet world” that would show us how other countries are dealing with the aliens
I bought myself pizza today (29/06/2024) after watching these mixture of emotions🥹😀 I really deserve it🍕🍕😀
Film nasıl la giden var mı ?
this movie is a masterpiece of Love between humans during chaos that we rarely see today, but more crucial than ever, thanks for the great plot and script. I watched and loved it!
Not the cat 😭
I can't believe I wasted my money watching this on IMAX, It's the worst movie I have watched this year🙄🙄 It's just sick Lupita Nyong'o and her cat trying to survive New York invaded by blind aliens that hate noise.
They are hunted by liberarions 😂😂
The movie is much better than this trailer
The cat 😢
Day One >>>> Inside Out 2
Lupita my dear❤❤❤❤ you are best
This looks so intense it looks amazing I would love to see this
1:12 they cut this entire sequence from the final movie
I liked one and two. This just seems to be another version of day one and not the same characters I am disappointed.
Waiting for Regan's action while at the radio station in Quiet Place 2, how will the aliens end?
Do share your opinion on if you like the ending? Should 'Samira(Lupita)' also somehow find a way to escape rather than being killed by the alien👾?  I expected that some one kills at least one of them with a proper plan haha. I know its a day 1 in the movie but that would be more awesome.   BTW, I loved the movie a lot.
I hope I get to watch the full webseries in the future ❤
I hope they show the military and explain whats going on with the worlds military
Can't wait to pirate this crap.
oh look another 🐒
10/10! One of the best movies of 2024 SO FAR
Looks terrible. 👎
Movie is TRASH , 6/10.. I just finished watching it, not scary, no suspense, no action.. nothing..
GREAT MOVIE!!!! Sad ending but great movie!!
Having it start out noisy and crowded only to taper off into silence and emptiness is going to make this movie even scarier.
I'm desensitized to most things but cats are my weak spot and I would't want to watch this if something happened to this one ):
Movie is SO BAD.
Making a Pg-13 horror movies is like making Kids Pop Trap Music.. Nobody wants it
So excited for this!
These aliens movies are so bullshit.  ETs aren't anything like Hollywood makes them out to be.  It all seems like it's part of setting up the False Flag event.  Be warned.
...The stupidest movie I've seen this year. To think it got a 7 to 10 between Google reviews and IGN.  It's a cry-on-my-shoulder drama, with the Quiet Place monsters sprinkled around it, nothing more.  They don't touch on the alien invasion itself, its origin, or how it was dealt with on an authoritarian level.  Even all of that lacking from a prequel / origins installment could've been excused, if the action and suspense was there.  Doesn't hold a fart to Quiet Place 1 or 2.  SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Probably better off watching the new Bad Boys instead.
It was terrible I actually fell asleep 😂, be sure to rate it on rotten tomatoes because they have it rated like it's best this year 😂
GOING TO SEE IT TODAY WITH MY BEST FRIEND, I WILL UPDATE AFTER
Finally another quiet place film 😁
New York, the perfect place for this kind of movie! 😍
this trailer actually sucks compared to the movie lol
1:26  Alien: Covenant  :)
I just wish the movie did not have  a black person as the star. I don't want to see any film  that has a black lead.
I was expecting more than the typical ‘white-male savior’ story line.
Lupita is an amazing actor absolutely brilliant can’t wait!!
Wasting time, really, meaningless story for pizza. When i check timeline in Book scene, i shocked, bc it was Middle of the time, and nothing happening and explained
Venom x A Quiet Place me, please. I always imagined the natural predator of the symbiotes to look and move the aliens in Quiet Place, but instead of being sensitive to sound, they emit it.
I can't wait to see how things went down in the city!
THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE TITLED AS "HARLEM PIZZA" INSTEAD OF QUIET PLACE.
Sign me up!
I always wondered if these creatures have such super sensitive hearing... wouldn't they be able to hear all insets and wouldn't they be able to hear people breathing, hear heartbeats? Blood rushing through veins?
Available in Hindi?
man i love seeing john krasinski on screen so much
We need avengers
again alien invasion in the "WORLD" (AMERICA)
Just watched it, very nice movie tbh. Go see it. Seeing the monsters invade at first and going on a rampage should motivate you enough to make you see this
The movie was below the expectation. Nothing but boring! Expected much better than this. Nothing even happened in the movie. No twists and turns just nothing. Very disappointed !
Worst movie, 1 and 2 was better
Day 472 to Day one wonder what happened in the rest of the days 😮
👍Thank you to all the actors for their role and the teams.  It is really interesting to watch preferably in 4dx for a more cinematic experience.
Wasting time, history is very bad, Movie for kids to fight for pizza, cat is more important than your life, what are these jokes!!
KEEP THE CAT ALIVEEEE!!!
The ending I'M CRYING
!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!     All that for cheese pizza seriously 😂
So boring!!!!!
Another lame sci fi special effects movie bet it will flop
I just saw the film. Honestly they dropped the ball with this one. Being that it was titled “Day One” it didn’t explain anything about the origin of the aliens, and their reasoning for coming to earth.  There were many unanswered questions just from the film alone. I honestly would not recommend this movie if you’re going in with the mindset that the film is connected to the previous two. I would say see the go see the movie in support of Lupita!
This is the first ever movie that has a quiet and a silent mode. A Quiet Place - Day One 2024 one of the most scariest supernatural science fiction horror thriller movie in theatres near you on 28th June 2024. Discover why our world went quiet. Directed by Michael Sarnoski.😮
https://youtu.be/YPY7J-flzE8?si=3GLxHK3jyHQYTPFZ
is it worth it? 🫨
Lupita N'yong'o has been reduced to doing only horror films! This is disgraceful!
في يوم قريب جدا من أيامنا الحالية، سنشهد الرعب، بطريقة لاتصدق
Hello friends just got back from seeing Day one all I can say is wow. I thought it was extremely intense and also touching. If you can go see it and Dolby  Stereo. Man that under water scene that sound shook the whole theater. The acting was just great. I highly recommend it.
I swear we saw this part already
I hope the cat can keep silent till the end, if it start meowing, hmmm well...
This movie was off to a great start but I feel like they missed their chance to make it better. They never tell you how the aliens got on earth, what their goal was when they landed on earth or what the aliens eat. I mean I learned Sam really wanted pizza and  the cat’s adventures are some of the best part of the movies. 🐈🔥🔥 this movie is a solid 6/10 for me.
Its boring as f**k, not recommend to watch it.
Filmnya keren, dah nonton 2x🥰🥰
0:55 BAA!-
Uaaau, já quero assistir.
Where is Emily Blunt? The movie need to continue with the original character.
Eddie Munson's here
Just seen this I wonder if the kids in the wishing well mad it safe.
Went to go see it today and a bit disappointed. I feel like a lot was left out. 😢
Dude this movie was BORING nothing like the first two.  I didn’t know I was watching twilight
Повна туфта … до кінця не додивився! Сценарій написаний на …… не рекомендую фільм
I just watched the movie, alot of these scenes shown in the trailer aren’t even in the actual movie. Still a 10/10 movie tho 🔥
Who else is worried about her cat? 🐈
Watching as yalll decide if mutes or deaf people gon survive is crazy 😂😂😂
just watched yesterday... this movie was mid
Just watched the movie in cinema, amazing work. Especially female lead. Oscar level acting .... 👍👍👍
So what happened to the cat?
Tonight’s the night
Should i watch it? Is it worth it?
At 1:17 it looks like they are flying away from New York but the bad thing is Eric is not there anymore and the cat isint there anymore to
Hi from 2024 ! Anyone ? 😂❤🎉
Who came here from future and tayped quitley
If the cat gets hurt, I'm out.
If anything happens to that cat I will ride at dawn. Because don't do that.
My fart alone would be the end of me 😂😮😢
This turned out to be woke, not watching it
The only black free movie, couldn't resist anymore it seems
To know that Lupita went through a vocal dysfunction and had to remain quite for a very long while is astounding.
Cant wait for a movie were nobody speaks I just love it I love it😀😀
Where is those previous actors emily where r you that time and day 1 monsters look more modern compare after that 😂😂😂😂
because everyone became deaf
Just a token movie.
dont make sense if they invaded us within the city, wheres  noise polution everywhere.😂😂😂😂😂
Poxa cadê os atores dos filmes anteriores 😢
film jaman sekarang pasti ad orang hitam nya yg jdi main caracter 😂
Formation of Flankers at 1:01.  Worth watching just for that
Please let that cat survive😔
I remember my manager she’s like a mushroom 🍄‍🟫 suddenly appear from nowhere 😅
I love this ❤❤❤
Is there any hope??
I’m going to be so upset if the cat dies
Imagine having one of these really loud diarrheas. Me and my lactose intolerant friends would be damned 💀
Wait 😑 so at 1:32 how do the creatures know when to JUMP if they have no sight? I guess like a bat uses echolocation? 🤷🏻‍♂️ but that wouldn’t make sense either because then they wouldn’t have such a problem finding humans that aren’t making noise 🤔 imma just say “Movie Mistake” and move on 😂 👏🏼
Just watched this movie an hour ago. Its nothing looks like the trailer, expect more! It was the best experience.
Getting 'The Darkest Hour' vibes 😅
Just watched this movie few hours ago. I give it 6.5 / 10. The first movie is still a masterpiece.  Don't get me wrong, It's still an enjoyable movie to watch, this movie is not boring at all. I like the acting, But It still lacks in something, It's feels like eating a pizza without tomato sauce or cheese.  If only they give a longer scene of interaction between the military and the monster, this movie could be at 8 / 10 or 10 / 10.
I won’t be going to see this film because they ruined a great movie by making it a woke movie. Fed up seeing black and white actors together all the time now . Boring.
J'ai hâte 🎉
Diversity
Film ny bagus.. Tapi agak kesel sama tu meong Bisa² ny dia berulah d kandang monster Untung ampe akhir selamet 😤
Kalki 2898 ad ❤
We pretending we didnt see the netflixation aint we?
This franchise is gonna nail it..
柒頭葉兆麟呀
Its crap film about pizza😅
Im not going to the movies. Why cant u just stream it
sumpah ini film paling sempurna yang pernah saya Tonton,dri alur crta smpe part"nya bgtu sempurna wow ❤
Is this movie actually scary? From the trailer doesn't seem scary but the film is tagged as Horror. Anyone?
I’m a simple man. I see Djimon Hounsou and Joseph Quinn? I buy a ticket.
Kucingnya kau buat mati pasti ya ica? 🥹
Thing I find so funny about this movie is we already get a flashback in quiet place 2 explaining how this all happened so why tf do we need a prequel to explain what we already know?!?!
Is she supposed to be homeless/sickly looking?
Quien está listo para epocalipsis y los verdaderos demonios y espíritus . ❤y bestias malignas
Can't wait these movies. Deadpool 3 and a quiet place 3.
The mute people the survival.
My husband and I can rarely agree on a movie to go see in theaters but we're SOO excited for this
Do yourself a favor and go see this movie everybody
THE CATTT SHOULD SURVIVE!!!
Am happy for my sister Lupita Nyong'o,,
They should do a movie called "A Non-Comment on Social Media Place" 😂
Examples of potential routes: Naval: A crew of a vessel (tug, Military, cruise, etc) contending with only what they know about the mainland crisis. Air: A passenger flight struggling to deal with the situation. International: How other countries are handling the invaders.
a run away slave movie
Makes me wonder how many people died from a fart.
I can already tell by the AA action character that this movie won’t be worth seeing it
I bet all the deaf folks in this will survive if there are some deaf folks
At 0:54 (the giant crowd), pause the video and look in the top right part of the screen. There’s something crazy there.
Hoping it 2hours beyond and long
I thought she had a puppy in her hand but it’s just a cat… phewww that takes off a bunch of stress off my shoulder 🙂‍↔️
So hyped!!!!
if joseph dies in this i swear 😭
For God's sake, where is the cat??!!
There is one question that I haven't managed to answer after watching the first two films.  Are the aliens attracted to noise because it cues them in to a food source, or do they attack noisy people because they hate the noise?  I.e., are they using sound to hunt, or do they just want silence?
The design for these aliens is truly the most horrific, terrifying, vile thing I've seen with my own two eyes and I love it.
i wonder , if i talk like the alien voice, what happens are going to be ?
Something about that style choice where they make dark skinned people's eyes all big and wide to appear scary/creepy-looking feels... wrong and exploitive.
If the cat dies, I’m walking out. I will straight up leave the theater.
Muito bom
Wanna watch it in theatre but Paramount supports Israel, oh well :/
I need to know if the cat will be ok.
Are they not attracted to the noise they make themselves?
Coming this summer, every movie you’ve ever seen, but with BLACKS
I wonder how long it took for them to realise they needed to shut it 😂
All I can say is: "The cat better be alive!"
I just hope its diverse..  As long as they are making these movies, brainwashing and conditioning the majority to convince them they are the minority. That’s all that matters to me.
Birdbox vibes
Jadi kucingnya kek mana? Mati dimakan aliennya gara gara bunyi meong, gitu? Suka suka mu lah pak  Sud 🗿
I hope they make another sequel, with a resistance, since after Part 2, they know that high frequency sounds are their weakness, anyways, this movie is gonna be lit
I don’t meet minimum standards to afford the movie ticket to see this movie…Mendocino County, has the best bi weekly free food distribution in the 11 Western States. Perfect weather and fresh drinking water. North West Coast of California…( just so all of you know )…
Looks sick. But is this a remake of a Quite Place that came out in 2018 🤔💭
Not me just finidng out about this! 😭
If the cat dies I’ll give this movie a rating of 0.
#(இந்த படம் தமிழ் ட்ரெய்லர் தமிழ் மொழியில் வெளியாகுமா அண்ணா பிளீஸ் அப்டேட்ஸ் பண்ணுங்க அண்ணா...❤❤❤ இந்த இரண்டு படங்கள் வேற லெவல் சம்பவம்...❤❤❤
You couldn't build on better films.  I have to see this.  But this looks disturbing.  Talk about give the people what they want.
This whole franchise is just the gift that keeps on giving. 🔥
Bravo
คนช่างแม่ง แมวห้ามตาย
nooo the cat💔💔💔
Am more exited for watch this movie
I refuse to watch the trailer.. its gonna ruin the beginning for me. No thanks
Such LAZY writing what a shame why make the creatures impenetrable? if they were so indestructible why didn't they stay on there home planet? Even dinosaurs skin is penetrable. A fun movie but that aspect always annoyed me. Like why not give humanity a fighting chance maybe the skin could be penetrable but they still have super strength ect.  They seem like they should have died off out in space if they just killing everything what would they eat? how would they survive? your telling me an alien species lands on earth and is perfectly adapted to the environment?
I watch tv daily and today was the first time that I saw a preview for this movie! I am too excited! I can’t wait!
CARBINE. w lotsa ammo fix dat QWYX!!!😮🎉
LOL...My guy is just straight up dancing in his own world, twirling and shhh. She didn't even acknowledge his greatness..0:24
This franchise can keep making movies based on different POVs and it will never get boring ❤
I want India Telugu language the movie please
we go from the beautiful Emily Blunt to this.... what's her name.... lupita
Anyone noticed the music used from alien covenant?
I see a cat there’s no way I’m going to watch this movie 😭
A quiet Place and The Silence next collab please
The first movie was just brialliant.. hope this one lives upto that..
My favorite part 1:18 😮😮😅
If anything happens to that cat I’m going to lose it.
Very happy to see that Joseph Quinn is in this. Apart from being a talented actor, he’s very easy on the eye.
Why is Jim Halpert putting all of us through this?
If you live in Australia or new Zealand you are safe. 😄
Can’t be much worse than that dreadful sequel.
Finally 1 week
It seems the trailer showed the complete film already. Save money
Every scene without the cat, is a scene I dont like 😠
Well we already know what happened to the dude at the end of this trailer lol
Cloverfield related?
They shouldnt change the original character of this movie its more better. We can say this is the 3rd a quite place but theres no more excitement coz all the original character is not in this movie anymore.
As long as the cat stays alive the whole film I’ll be content
Aaaaaaaaaaaaand..... WOKE. 🤣
They stop making these types of movies
my boy Eddie is still alive yall
haha my cat would get us killed
Gw nonton yg sebelum2nya sampe ikut gak bersuara anjir wkwk
Shhh Be Quiet...
Their jawline is built like a triangle after this
When does it first come out
Let's hope they don't mess this up like they did the second one the second one was horrible and redundant
I’m ready! Solidarity and serenity… yes please!
I always wanted to know how these things managed to take over the earth
Being served the spotify version of this ad is extremely unpleasant. The panicked breathing sounds on there own sound like the inside of my head when I'm hyperventilating, without warning at work made it far more unpleasant.  From a marketing perspective big thumbs down.
They look exactly like terramorphs from Starfield 😮
dude if that cat dies in the movie I will cry
Day One part? So are they gonna make 100 days of Quiet or more? LoL
I JUST FOUNT OUT JOHN IS NOT DIRECTING THIS ONE , SO ILL WAIT FOR STREAMING
A quiet place has been one of the best movies ever. My opinion.  I love it and looking forward to seeing it.
this movie sucks cant watch my twitch in peace
People who cant wait for the series to go on  👇
I love Lupita…I can wait
Wow I love the characters that’s playing in this one I had no idea this was out
I like this trailer more than the second. 0:43-1:03, the sound effects with the imagery just give me chills! I can’t wait!
Did the cat survived?
Please .. let the cat survive !!!! 😭
The scariest thing about this movie for New Yorkers is the idea of shutting up.
only if my classmates were this silent my classmates be yapping they wouldnt last a second in the quiet place
Imagine having bronchitis during this
The coughing part was so realistic
I walk very quietly
WHY DO corrupt Hollywood HAVE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN OF COLOR LOOKING SO UNATTRACTIVE ? BECAUSE THEY ARE THREATENED AND JEALOUS OF OUR TRUE BEAUTY!!!
Love the first 2 but I seem to be the only one frustrated it's not following some of the same characters.
Another prequel cash grab, if they knew they had to keep quiet, couldn't someone have told Emily Blunt and her brood 🙃
Another prequel cash grab, if they knew they had to keep quiet, couldn't someone have told Emily Blunt and her brood 🙃
I wish its not disappointing I'm watching this in cinema
im so glad its a black woman as the main character that way it doesnt matter if shes a bad actor because its progressive
Caramba, eu pensei que ia ser um filme tranquilo quando vi as fotos meses atrás,do Joseph com o Gatinho e a Lupita, agora que vi o trailer não sei se vou mais assistir rsrs. O Joseph só faz filme de terror kkk
I have to admit, I'm a fan of the "A Quiet Place" franchise.
So what happens when they fart while sleeping? I take it all the snorers are gone.
What's with the musical sting at the end? It's from like Alien: Covenant??
smh
AI Thumbnail
I got a YouTube advert for this recently, one of the relevant to me adverts unlike adverts for cat food (I don't own a cat, I own a dog).
What happened to the cat?
As If we already don't have a Billion problems.
Vou esperar sair para descobrir se o gato morre, pq senão nem vou assistir
Tá de parabéns
Muito bom 😊
EDDIE IS ALIVE!!!
Its was not only one meteorite on mexico??
They fell from the sky. So are they Aliens, or Demons?
im sorry but whats with the Alien : Covenant soundtrack fragment thats used here????? Is that a hint or its just a public use composal
Is that Joseph Quin! Heck yeah!!!!!!
THERE IS AN OLD MOVIE OUT LIKE THIS ON FORGOT THE NAME.
DEMAIS CURTI👍🏼😍
REAL
I truly wanted this one to not be the beginning they should have saved this one for the 4th sequel.... June 28th should have picked up from the island 🏝️.... But I'm still going to see it LOL AND ITS GONNA BE GREAT !!!
Be quiet
lupita picks the best movies so it's gotta be worth it
How do you go to the toilet if you have to be quiet?
Looks cringe af 😂😂😂
During the super bowl the trailer came out I was like oh my gosssh another quiet place my goodness
Wack I wanted part 3 of the original story guess gonna have to wait a lil longer but still gonna watch this joint look lit
So happy to see one of my favorite movie series coming back again. Ready to be scared shitless as it turns from complete silence to an alien flying at my face
When’s this coming out
A movie about ⚫️ being silent 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Can't wait 🎉
Elon musk built and a whole shelter thing
No Monkey's please....
You know this completely out there and science fiction because it has a black woman being quiet.
It's just ordinary, but they try to make it sound scary, as if it's extraordinary... this movie is a bit over the top.
DO - NOT- HURT- THE  CAT....or I will find you!
John isn't directing this one, I don't have high hopes
they are using alien covenant music cues in this trailer
“A Quiet Place” quietly might be one of the greatest film franchises. You can tell a lot of love and effort go into making these.
As long as the cat survives. Everything else doesn’t matter
Cool thing I noticed and I'm sure other people did as well. Timestamp 1:00 you see SU27s and its the Russian Air Force Demo Team.
😂😂😂😂
More woke rubbish
i enjoy the quiet
I can't wait to see this
I always thought its a horror movie. Are the others ones that action-like as well ?
Didn’t part 2 start at day one at the ball field??  I get that now they can go back and do different places around the world for day 1 unless I misunderstand but my husband and I are in disagreement because he is saying this is a prequel to part 1 and I say part 2 was already a prequel since it started at day 1. They should have called part 3 something else
I didn't watched the second yet I'm about to do I just forgot
Aliens that harvest humans!
0:44 ..wait that yell sounds familiar
I might watch this one
شا يهبون على Stc tv ولا ماشي
Can someone spoil for me if the cat will survive
melusi elite skin
This is what Quiet Place 2 should've been. I almost boo'd at the end thinking it was supposed to be a true prequel.
To be honest, this has to be one of the stupidest ideas for a sci-fi/ horror film EVER.
Am I the only one who just want to watch this movie to know if the cat survives?😢😂
Finally a decent Movie to watch at the Theaters.......
Cant wait
After the last Quiet Place movie where they released the dog, I’m just hoping they don’t do the same to the cat. Made me lowkey sad.
When did this come out?
I thought the second movie covered the initial invasion NO? The baseball field scene???? Help…
ITs. C O M I N G. Fr. Fr. 🫠
Of course had to take a story that was starring white families, and turn it black. DEI it up to erase Whites - like everything out of hollywood. Maybe Bad Boys 5 will be two white guys.  Oh.  Right.  This only goes one way.  As always.
When is it out?
Todos os filmes foram excelentes!Se no campo foi fascinante, imagina,no centro urbano... multidão ,silêncio e a luta por sobrevivência.Expectativa imensa pelo próximo👀🤫
1000s of people across the world trying to hold in their farts ......oh the humanity
Gross. No thanks
Vai ser no cinema ou no App?
Ouuu stranger things monsters hehe this gonna be awesome
This just might be the best one of the three. I'll wait for it to stream. I don't go to the theaters anymore.
Was a great looking trailer until… you know…
Jó fil
I’ll watch it if the cat survives 🥺
I need to know if the cat will survive.
1:29 😎❤
I don’t care if the movie is bad, the cat better survive or I’m sueing
Twitch add 🤮🤮🤮
Séries de filmes top
That eerie  “whoo-woo” sounds like it’s from Alien Covenant.
If I had a dollar for every time Lupita played a character that didn't talk much...
❤❤
looks woke not watching 👌
I hope the cat survives !! 🥲
This might be my first horror movie experience (btw I'm ten so pls don't bully me in the comments)
Im so tired of this franchise it makes no sense
Im really excited for this movie.
Crazy thing is we can get invaded anytime now that we know they exist 😂
C’est quoi l’âge requis
Comme les deux premiers films ont marchés et que les films avec ces acteurs qui représentent finalement que 12% des américains, ne fonctionnent globalement pas, ils ont trouvés un nouveau système pour nous les imposer. Vivement qu’en Afrique, qu’il y ai des studios de cinémas africains pour avoir leurs héros historiques et mythes, les contes et légendes africains, …etc, pour découvrir leurs histoires, avec leurs comédiens, surtout avec le nombre de potentiels spectateurs !
If that cat dies, i can't see the movie
why they have a clip of Russian SU-27??? we don’t have those aircraft nor do we use them
So they are telling me a 50 call and a tank shell cant hurt these guy? Like a grenade would do the trick. Or explosive bullets.. so many ways
if anything happens to the cat we riot
I can't wait to see it I've seen the first and second one I got to say it had me on the edge of my seat heart racing adrenaline pumping !
I hope the cat will be okay 😂
I'm looking forward to this movie
I will definitely missed the original cast 😔
I want to know if the cat survived.
So its Eddie Munson and the creatures look like Demogorgons?
I hope the cats okay
I don’t care no dies as long as the cat lives
I’m so pumped. The scream/siren was a nice touch.
The inevitable quota filler
Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring,
Black Americans becoming extinct in the movies
Can’t wait for this and can’t wait for Quiet Place 3 next year. PLEASE don’t let Hollywierd ruin THIS franchise
This movie is going to be huge because it’s the ONLY franchise NOT destroyed by Hollywood. I cannot wait😊
Came here because aespa made a reference about the escene at 1:11 in their music video "armageddon"
I’ve been dying to see more of how the military approached this and then was ultimately defeated.  I’m hoping they include some of that here.
Movie on its way to tell me that these raisin looking skeletons can survive 304kg AGM-65 missile, only to then show me a little girl killing one with a sharp object :
Everyone in the movie: Dies the cat: CATNOBLADE NEVER DIES
Wasn’t that the guy who died on the island in part 2 at the end of
Взорвали мосты, как же выбраться с острова ?? , бля в плавь , на пластиковых бутылках , кан страх ,лодке
That cat dies Im gonna sue someone
Jesus how are people not sick of this franchise, it’s the same gimmick every time. It’s no different than Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th. Repeat and repeat same monster premise.
watching in June 👇
Where did these creatures come from ??
Would love a story about astronauts on the space station watching all these aliens landing on earth then having them go back to earth to discover what happened.
So anyone know if the cat makes it just asking for a friend?
They can have New York
Stay Quiet Stay Alive
Quiet 🤫🤫
This trailer based itself on the Alien (1979) trailer - also see a cat is common in both movies.
WHY THE CAT 😭😭😭😭
Excited to see if it’s just day one. Or if there is also day two.
I want the cat to survive huhu
0:26 I could’ve nailed that spin better
im scared for the car
Wats the back stories about the aliens
wouldn't the noise of the creatures moving breaking things attract them to each other  ?
Can't wait this is definitely one I've been wanting to watch
Imagine being in NYC when this haopened. You're more than cooked
Still confused how the creatures tell the difference between sound made by themselves or by the humans
Finally a real prequel and not one of those half thought out prequels thats about one of the main characters
"Predictive Programming is theory that the government or other higher-ups are using fictional movies or books as a mass mind control tool to make the population more accepting of planned future events..."
i have been waiting for this one
Corazon chilling out there
Lupita, Alex, and Joseph? Blessed!🩷
Not feeling it.😢
I can’t wait to see this!
can't wait! I absolutely love part 1 and 2...
So now we get to see what was going on in the city and his story of Djimon (man on island) from the second.  If you rewatch the second one again and listen to his small story he gave in the fireplace you get to hear a part of what I hope they do show us in this one.   I won’t spoil it for you but just know it was very interesting to hear
❤
Əla filmdi super möhtəşəm klas
Ready for this one
This trailer reminded me of "The darkest hour". This movie is kind of based on that concept
This movies looks to me a combination of The Tomorrow War and The Silence.
Greaaat
Great

Soo scary and cool movie😎😎😎😎
Mmm seeing the cat, did any of ya notice that there was not a single live animal in sight from the previous films? Not a dog, cat, cow or even bugs buzzing and birds tweeting. Great detail if you ask me.👍
I don’t get it what’s this movie about?
Very nice 👍

This feels like war of the worlds and I am legend mashed together
Day 100000 and we’ll have a Starship Troopers-like movie XD
Hey guys I’m try to find a movie where this girl thought people was being kidnapped and killed after leaving a night club but the whole time it was her and her boyfriend killing peoole in their basement. Do you guy know the name of the movie?
Already thinking ahead: who sent this creatures to clean up Earth before they arrived.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Reminds me of I Am Legend
i am glad joseph quinn caught his break
This trailer was played in a kids movie and most of the kids were terrified 😔
Bro th3 Cat needs to survive this or I will put really sad!
Uffff que bueno se nota que pusieron las ganancias de las 2 pelis originales en el presupuesto de este spin off. Veremos a los angeles de la muerte haciendo leña al ejercito y como fue el caos en una gran ciudad xD
farting is forbidden
Can't wait.
A real cat would be yowling its head off at the first sight of one of those creatures. Its owner would last 37 seconds. As realistic as the silent infant in the second movie. 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
When I first saw this I thought it was a new War of the worlds movie because of the meteors and the place 💀
I want to watch this Movie but We need Netflix Account
Bro but why does this actually go hard?
i hope that cat will still be alive at the end.  im rooting for you kitty cat! anyway, i can't wait to see this film!
The New Alien,  it passes the torch I think
0:28
Ótimo filme! Transmite um desespero e uma angústia muito forte que parece até que estou no filme
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🤲🏾
I’m gonna be honest, I thought the thumbnail was ai generated 😭😂
I'm a dog person and I know all the dog's died 😭.
I can’t wait
What happend to the cat😭😭😭
Quiet place " In Da Hood"!!!! 😂😂😂😂
Not the cat😭😭😭😭
Legal
I LOVE apocalyptic movies !!!!!
Quiet place somalia ? A movie made in bangladesh ? Xdddddd
If the cat dies I’m gonna cry 😭 😭 😭
Já quero assistir, só de ver o trailer e muito bom
Looks great
I would love to see where they came from and how exactly they got here. Was it just chance they came here or intentional are they wild animals or are they weapons. So many questions and I hope it answers them. However I suspect the vast majority of questions will remain unanswered.
I don’t care what happens to anyone else, so long as the cat lives.
i don't now why, sound of the monster in this movie similar to sound of the monster in the movie "Edge of Tomorrow" 😁👍
Ас
Finally I'm Definitely Understand Day One
The deaf and introverts are the surviving heroes in this movie
I like the more calm and lurking horror like the first one. This is to much in your face.
Imagine A quite Place and Bird Box combined.
Its like becoming vegan overnight...😂😂
This movie got me in the hook. I really love it.😊
Looking forward for this one.
get woke go broke. hollywood, please go away
Estas son mis unicas palabras wow
¿SOLO ESCONDERSE Y CORRER Y SEGUIR CORRIENDO?
I'm getting The Tommrrow War vibes and I like it.
*stick falls*  *aliens freak out and make more noise but still someone knows where everyone is*
Part 1 was amazing, part 2 was trash... and this trailer gives me hope that this one will love up to the hype of the first movie. Well done... at least the trailer looks amazing.
Niceee I loved the other parts of this franchise I am sure this will be amazing too
0:40
This trailer music disturbs me, especially the ending distorted plucked strings, I love it.
Hmm let's swap the white people with black and call it a prequel to the prequel.
I have a feeling she's either more or entirely introverted. The fact we see her mouth moving only in gasps leave me to believe she is a silent person at heart and doesn't have loud expressions, hence the cat instead of small dog. Why she lives while the chaos ensues.
Hope the cat survive 🙏🙏
It always starts in the US
I'd watch the Italian version of this movie. 😂
Why do they always go back to the beginning 😕 on movies why not start from the beginning from the jump
0:52 *MCs looking horrified at something offscreen* “okay” 0:57 *hospital staff in an emergency* “okay…” Me: *remembers that hospitals have nursery’s* “😳”
A preview of the next few years on earth
THE CAT :(
Wrong main characters
Día Uno...🚛🚛👍
I just need to know if the cat makes it then I can watch this in peace
First they would cast barely blk white passing ppl now they cast only European or African blk ppl. America really hates its natives bro
Это кот Димона заминированного тапка
If the cat dies… im just not watching
There’s gonna be a scene where they have to be like: 🫣🫢🤫 and the cats gonna be like: meow 😉✨🤩🐱 and they’re gonna have to run 😂🤣
Just finished watch the first two movies. I can’t wait to watch the third one in theaters.
It’s always New York
0:45 goofy ahh red ball scream
In New York is this a sign we need to leave 😂😂
Have you noticed that most of these comments are fake? Gotta fake it, otherwise Paramount wont make it
Lupita is gonna nail this role
JOSEPH QUINN😍😩
A continuing of “The Silence”??🤷🏻‍♂️
Even the aliens knew NY has fckd up gun laws. Lets see thismovie in the south. Alien invasion last 1 week their looking for hidden aliens scared to come out
Im starting to think that production companies do background checks on actors and actresses before casting them, because that's what led Joseph Quinn (aka Eddie) to star in this film!
If the cat doesn't make it. I'm rioting.
The first time a trailer gave me goosebumps in 12 years and it's over like that. I haven't gone to theaters since the Force Awakens and didn't see the first two installments of this movie but I want to see this in theaters.
First Day First Show
This is amazing
Why did they have to give her a cat. 😢
💛thats Riel🧡 dayONE/in thå gYm with yøü...✨
Idk the first movie already established what happened, it doesn't seem like a necessary movie. New storylines might be fun but it just feels like an extended scene from the first one on a grander scale
If they hate noise so much why do they produce so much of it?
I thought it happened because Obama was president 😂
Why do I have the a sneaky suspicion that this isn’t just a movie?
Please drop Hindi trailer
1:32
this is the sequel to the 2018 movie
An say is wow wow  wow...Thats Appetizing 😻
I gues the suspension of disbelief here is believing all armies in the world cant handle an invasion like that, sure there would be tons of casualties but it’s not like they are invincible
Cities are noisy af
Опять негров показывают, один из них гей, а другой трансгендер
Rare we get to see apocalyptic movies as it actually goes down. Should be interesting. Always a fan of seeing Djimon Hounsou also 👌
Love the play on screams, turning them into sirens.
They are also working on other sequels where you have to be loud the whole time.
I hope she holds that cat through the entire movie
amazing I can't wait to watch it
Can't wait to see 3rd installment ❤❤❤But missed Emily Blunt...
I thought United States of America is white majority country with ~60-70% white and ~12-14% black... The data is so clumsy due to the fact that many literal whites are now claiming themselves "non white" due to... due to something... should i say leftiness?
I cant belive the production quality got even better, than the last two! This is what I thought, when the first movie came out, brilliant!
So do they eat people or??
Ya'll know Black people be going extinct if these monsters come to Earth.
The eerie music is "spores" by Jed Kurzel, Alien Covenant.
cant wait
Not sure we really need this prequel
I LOVE Lupita she is so pretty and a great actor! Can’t wait to watch..excited to see it all from the beginning 😮
Way worse than any zombie apocalypse.
Alien covenant soundtrack 🤨
its Giving birdbox kno?????😂
May 2024 here we r! Waiting for this Impatiently!
I will always love these type of movies … World War Z , War of the Worlds, The Mist and bird box… list some others I forgot please 🫶🏽
I wish all movies would get a prequel
Los Angeles California 2524 New York City 2724
ALL i want to know is, does the cat survive?😟
I will wait to see the spoiler whether the cat survives. If not then no way I'm watching it fr
Again black🤮
I hope that can answer people's questions or clarify theories about the military, government, the fall of communication media except for some media such as radio etc
I hope nothing happens to the cat.
https://youtu.be/YPY7J-flzE8?t=87 kinda souds like alien coveant
Powerful movie this. It tells a great story. ❤
Bulshit
Cat was like my people came for me....evil laugh hehehe fur ball hehe
Sonic Ultimate World Movie: A Quiet Place Day One
LET'S GOOOOO🔥🔥🔥
Looks like a covering all basis movie to me.
bird box 😂
And people say that a zombie or robots would be the scarryest apocalypse , nah this would be , imagine dying because a fart XDDD
Vai ser do caralho🤌🏾
my sister said tengtengetenge when Lupitas face was white 💀
Wow cant wait to watch this movie! Excited to see Djimon Hounsou and Lupita Nyongo together!
was hyped for a new one not so much anymore after learning a pavement ape is the leading role hard pass
This actually looks like a masterpiece
It'll be interesting to see why noise wasn't tested when they found out that A) they were blind and B) normal munitions don't work by the military.  I can't be the only one that thinks testing the range of sound amplifications would be a fairly easy thing to parse out once you realized they were blind and that couldn't have taken more than 24-48 hours.  Love the movies, but after finding out how weak they actually are to such a simple solution it no longer feels feasible they'd overrun the planet.
Save the kitty cat! 😭❤
Okay...it's worth...
Новое порно из голливуда для тех, у кого язык во рту не умещается.
I’m not a fan of spin offs but I’m super excited for this one. It tells 2 different stories.
i watch this trailer once a day to feel something.
Autistic paradise
Some day in the future something like this will realy happen here  on earth but its going to be 1000x worse than this just read " REVELATION 9:3--10"
Ok can we get a trailer 2 now? And i expect a response…
FINALLY!!!! I can’t wait
I m waiting
Lupita is a gem.
I wish we see Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, at least in short scenes. Im going to watch this on movie theater and then watch again the other movies, love chronological order ☺
Don't breathe 👀🤫stay quiet
Ya ya ya…let me guess, white people are the true villains of this movie😒🕴🏼
Ok i got the army of dogs 😡 to start that riot in a trailer 😡 but nice trailer because I ❤ dogs😊
Funny how easy it is to kil them , why do they control humanity now ?
Aaaah, the first part had too many white people in it, so they decided to make part two for coloured
Ooooh, the movie creators decided if u put a cat the movie will have automatic success. The first one sucked big s. Especially the main male character who was a producer as well. I m not going to watch but i hope kitty was all right.
I watched the first two films, and they were already pretty scary.  I feel this one will take the cake. I'm not sure if I'll watch this in a dark room lol
Bro why is the thumbnail AI😭
I would really like to see this movie from the perspective of an island nation were the aliens never arrived for example maybe follow a SAS team from the United Kingdom sent into mainland Europe to findout what happened
FILMAÇO.
Kudos to Kransiski for coming up with this franchise! Love it!
Interesting. They are Russian combat aircraft, Su-35s seen at 01:00 . When I first watched the trailer I thought they were US / Western jets - then my latest viewing I froze the scene and there they are. So does this mean we see what is happening outside of America in the movie, or a mistake?
This is quickly becoming one of my favorite horror franchises
This looks way better than the first one
Hmm, not seeing any comments about white face 🤔
Wow
I love lupita!❤️❤️❤️❤️
All I know is that there is a cat and I need to watch this movie to make sure the cat will be ok :/
They change the characters 😢
I want movie like alien isolation.
I'm so excited to see the military fighting back those things.
Thing that I dont understand is their heads are flayed open a LOT, not just when she uses distortion so WHY are they invincible any other time? The military also would have keyed into sound weakness as a defense at minimum! Cool story, great acting but MAJOR plot holes! I mean, a human heart beat should be audible to them so standing still you should still be killed! They have a LOT of "splaining" to do lol!! Make it make sense in the 3rd one so I can FULLY love these movies! Emily blunt all sweaty is worth it alone but come on, give us a bonus!!
I Hope That Cat Survives On His Own Technique Way From Any Situations From NY City!!😔😔😊😊😮‍💨😮‍💨
0:25-1:34 I'm Pretty Sure Hope The Cat Frodo Finds His Way To Survive In The Final Scene Of The Clip Movie Where She Can Find Her Back. If I Cry Out My Tears To See If The Cat Is Alive Or Not I'm Going To Fear What's Going To Happen To The Scene When It Comes Out!! 😔😔😨😰🥺🥺🐈🖤🤍
Yes!
Part 3 when though ... 😂
why involved a cat????? 😭😭😭😭
And why are there Su-27 flying in formation in the trailer?
Cooollll
This is going to be bad, calling it now. A B-grade prequel feeding off an A-grade franchise, none of the original cast are in it. This will be an IMDB 5.*
Why settle for mediocre movie nights when you can have extraordinary ones with IPTVEVER? Try their 24-hour free trial and discover a world of cinematic delights waiting to be explored.
Finally something to watch :)
The TQP movies are some of my all-time favorites. I'm holding out hope that this'll do them justice
this trailer alone has nightmare fuel written all over it 😂
The most heartbreaking scene is gonna be when the Cat dies. 😢
I love the concept of this movie. I always want to watch more of it. Now, finally, they made it, back to the day one: how did they end up there? So excited. Can't wait.
The sound effect from prometheus trailer
1 of the best movie.😊
Sukhoi??
I’m in
What are the Russian Knights doing here?!
why is there the sound of "Prometheus" at the end of the trailer?
What was that?
Arent those Sukhoi 27s?
Overrated series imo but at least this one looks better than the last
👀 thr first snd can't wait for the second ❤
i hope the cat is okay
А как какать то во вселенной этого фильма, трудно же будет не пукнуть во время процесса
Love it.....
I just realized this is a prequel to a quiet place 😅

Alien, Quiet Place new movies coming which are my fav
Im only 32 seconds into the trailer, and I’m already upset. LEAVE THE CAT OUT OF THIS  Jokes aside, I really want a Quiet Place where the protagonist survives with their cat who is smart enough to stay quiet. Please stop this needless killing of fictional cats  EDIT: HER CAT IS ALIVEEEEEE PLEASEDONTKILLIT
Can’t wait.. love this series
they did whiteface
Somebody has to agree that the music effect used in this trailer is the same from the soundtrack in (alien: covenant 2017)??
İzlemeye değer bir film kesinlikle tavsiye ederim
Thanks ❤
Süper ötesi bir durum biran önce izleyin
Gözəl filim dir ❤
ME WATCHING DA TRAILER:   ALSO ME: WHERE IS DA CAAAAAT? 😢😢
The weakest part of the plot is... the core of the plot -  those monsters who have keen ears.   If the creature can hear a tiny sound kilometers away, that means the loud sound will definitely hurt it. The very loud sound will simply damage it`s hearing organs and, due to creatures` blindness, make them completely disabled. Did you ever hear the sound of tank engine in a close range? - I did. It is *very loud* . Same for the jets, ships, shots and explosions.  So all that ''battle'' between the aliens and men`s modern armies does not make any sense - aliens will lose before humans make their first shot.
Be QUIET😊
man, they telling us what's going 2 happen ,

Okay but does the cat survive???

"Discover why our world went quite".. Truly an understatement.. #ParamountPictures  #AQuitePlace #EmilyBlunt #LupitaNyongo #JosephQuinn #CeciliaMurphy #2024USA❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I just need the cat to be safe
Böyle kaliteli bir yapım ancak Marvel studiodan çıkabilirdi 🙏🏻
All I care about is if the cat survives? They’re pretty silent creatures.
This is what we like to see. Origin stories are just _the BEST!!_
I just care she still has kitty 0:52
I feel like pre-order for tickets will be so bought up so much the sites might be slowed down due to the excess amount of people online, not just one day but for at least 3 lol. This is going to be epic!
Olduqca maraqlı filmdir izləməyə dəyər...!

I wonder by which series the dumb inhabitants of the attacked lands will come up with a sound trap? For example, a mine with an audio player
Lupita'ya büyük saygı duyuyorum.  Sahnedeki Juliet'ten 12 Yıllık Esaret'teki Patsy'ye, US'dan Kara Panter'e ve şimdi de bu güzel kadına, harika oyuncuya.
My mother-in-law knows how to walk silently around the house and suddenly appear at the most inopportune moment. Now I understand that she is training us for the arrival of these creatures.

Korku gerilim güzel bir film
Love the idea of showing the apocalypse from another character's perspective. Also nothing better happen to the cat 🐈
Congratulations to the Team 😊

Can't imagine the unfathomable carnage on day one in a big city
This is gonna be something great, it's with a new director I believe so I hope they make the choice to up the violence a bit, show us what these creatures can do instead of just smacking people about
Melhor filme do ano ❤❤❤❤
If anything happens to that cat, I will riot.
Muito emocionante, o primeiro, já vi,agora o segundo o coração ta na mãos surpe recomendo
Meu deus, emoção do começo,até o fim, um dos melhores que já vir
HOLD UP....HOLD UP!!!!!!! BOY HAVE I GOT AN IDEA FOR ALL YOU PRODUCERS, DIRECTORS, WRITERS AND ACTORS.......ITS A BIT OUT THERE, ITS A BIT CRAZY, ITS GOING AGAINS THE GRAIN A LITTLE BUT HEAR ME OUT.....  .......  ....................  .....lets make EVERY single new film and tv show only using black actors.   *oh wait
Why does the initial honking sound like the same one from the Helluva Boss pilot
I have been waiting for this movie ever since the first one. 2024 is going very strong so far.
My focus was on how nonchalant the cat was all throughout the trailer
That cat better be ok
me sitting here wondering how any living  thing survived the impact of falling from space
Lupita deserves better than this.
I need to see all the movies in franchise.
I hope they will make a final movie that ends the aliens invasion. ❤😅
Look who's finally got the budget!
Please don’t put animals in any scary movie 💔💔
They got us. They got us all. They know we'll see it just to make sure the kitty lives.
why they got that roblox man screaming sound
Imagine if you had bad gas or snored while sleeping. 😂
HO HUM
Glad that Island Man is back for this one
WHY THE HECK I ALREADY LEARNED ABOUT THIS TRAILER
I’m ready!!!
Zombie vibes.. y'all get prepared.. they are trying to send the hint..
Im pretty positive this movie is going to be outstanding.
wow
So the invasion is a bunch of blind aliens?
This looks very promising very suspenseful and creepy looking forward to it I get that the Abbots don’t need to be seen any longer since this is happening to a new group of characters and another part of the United States
Waiting patiently ⏳
Can't wait to see this movie!!
Wait what about the cat? 😢
On the bright side: it got rid of the noisy neighbour problem! :)
lupita and the cat. must see
why is this movie not on amc list
So they blow up the bridges so the aliens can stay on manhattan
who is the guy running 0:18

one question only, does the cat survive

The "A Quiet Place: Day One" trailer looks intense, hinting at the origins of the silence-dictated world. Lupita Nyong'o's inclusion promises exceptional performances, enhancing the anticipated prequel's depth. The June 28 release is eagerly awaited, inviting fans to discover the silence's onset. Social media channels are buzzing, offering various ways to engage with the movie's community. This immersive marketing strategy amplifies excitement for the film's universe expansion.

I loved the first 2 cant wait to see this one
Is it just me or is this the melody from prometheus/alien franchise?
To be honest, I'm sick to death of diversity in horror films  Just pick the person best for the role  You have completely ruined countless horrors/films putting in crap actors just because they are black  F OFF
anjir ga sabar buat nonton
Can’t wait!!
The EXCITEMENT I feel seeing this trailer! Big Fan! 😁
Absolute garbage
I saw this trailer in theaters when I saw dune. The entire thing was completely silent, but I thought it was intentional. Turns out we had an audio issue in the theatre, but it was honestly so powerful
Mükemmel anlamıyorum bu nasıl oluyor😮😮😮
Plot twist: the beasts wants everyone to be mewing because they can't make a noise.

Does the cat live though!!?
I remember when I first watch the Quiet Place I , I secured a subtitle without knowing I don't need it at all.
When is it coming out
Bad advertising ; we already knew how the world went quiet.
Wormwood is coming guys, biblical prophecy is unfolding as we speak. It's time to get right with Jesus. Wormwood will bring with it, chaos.
John Krasinski sucks
Djimon's character flashback
at 1:00 I think those are Russian jets but why?
Let's get some lore out of this
Be quite
I really hope the cat survives
N characters 🤮🤮🤮. Where are the beautiful original cast?
Very interesting. I always kind of wondered how these aliens managed to destroy the world, but now I guess we know. There was just so many of them.
Didn’t watch the previous ones but this one I think I can sit in a theater for‼️
This trailer hits hard
Why do they use the music from alien covenant in all their trailers? Did anyone else catch that?
I am so glad they casted this actress as the main character! I love her work so much! I’m really excited to go see this now❤
The shot with the monster running down the building goes hard af
This is considered a challenge video in black movie theatres 💀
Imagine if there was a movie called "A Loud Place" and people had to scream all the time or they'd get attacked by monsters.
Muito bom
I just wanna know if the cute cat’s gonna make it 🥺
" A Quiet Place: Origin " personally that would be a better title to me
Spooky season in June? Yes please!
Sensacional e misterioso !!! Lupita ❤️
Waiting for movie
She's prob the loudest one
I hope Jed Kurzel is getting royalties from you still using his Alien Covenant soundtrack for the Quiet Place trailers 😂. Looks great!
So excited! Loved all the parts before too - kinda different type of that usual standard S***-
These movies go so hard
That's a nice argument. But unfortunately, "⬇️⬆️⬅️⬇️⬆️➡️⬇️⬆️"
wait she starts off in the beginning holding a cat now im worried about the cat 😭😭😭😭
What makes this series different is that there is no time to react, wrong move you are gone. They would have catch me snoring after pulling crazy moves all day 😂
Can’t watch this this is what Gaza  is living right now !!🥲🥲
So this was before he died
A Diverse Casting Place

1:23
Filme excelente! Super recomendo!
Can we get an m2 Bradley IFV vs. a death angel?
I'm in!!
that guy meets the kid in quiet place 2, so excited! also, they need a tv show for this!
Muito bom esse filme
Ótimo filme, gostei muito
Exelente esse filme um dos melhores que ja vi

the cat🥲
will watch because of the cat
Save the cat at all costs lupita, I swear I'll leave cinema sobbing way back home.😭
Ugh another DEI blm movie, no thanks…
ANSIOSA 🇧🇷😬🖤
É de arrepiar os cabelos. O coração vai a mil.
Something about the jets storming through the air hits so hard
❤❤❤❤
Melhor filme que já vi.
Muito bom parabéns
I know I’m not the only one who jumped on here seeing Joe Quinn.
bora assistir top
why is the main character black? Are there really no white people for this role?
Muito top  Muita adrenalina Show
Filme magnífico, cheio de emoções. Vale a pena assistir cada segundo 👏🏻
More like day zero
Muito bom, eletrizante!!!❤
STOP NIGGAFYING everything i love!
Not interested
😮😮
Glad to see how we're gonna see how the city gets invaded winder if some people will find out how they came to earth
I've wondered where the US military is during all of this...We have QUITE a few armor piercing rounds...
this looks terrible
Can't wait
A high probability of a future event.
Filme de suspense onde nao pode fazer nem um barulho eu vi esse filme fiquei numa tensao mas e muito bom.
Every comment except this one manufactured by paramounts marketing team
Ah, the DEI woke version
Ótimo filme!
Um filme barulhento e assustador que envolvem o além, guerra e coisas ruim para o ser humano aqui na terra ou seja catástrofes.
Ja estou ansiosa para esse filme,o diretor é incrível e a atriz é maravilhosa,þnho certeza que sera incrivel!
Sensacional
Muito bom recomendo
A   A cat lady saving her cat, high stakes!
Another diversity hire movie
When the name of the movie comes up, that’s sound is directly ripped from alien covenant.
Bu güzel filim in bir yıl
Can't wait to know what happened to the cat
What's up with the hundreds of Azeri bot comments? Was Azerbaijan a huge market for the first two films? Weird...
black women are always the loudest though
I'm not watching this
Filme top super indico 😅
Möhtəşəm filmdir❤
That's just my opinion
Nadamas que esa es mi opinión 😢😢
It's not that I don't like it if I'm going to go see it at the cinema but that's just what I'm saying it has nothing to do with the first 2 installments that we saw but now we have to wait this one don't throw me hate please just😊😊
Bundan sonra ne olacağını görmek için sabırsızlanıyorsunuz
Great movie and great actors. I concluded from the clip that she is a strong woman  ￼  ￼
They will tell me that I am a fool but I liked seeing the continuation of the family but if you want to see that I will understand you please don't throw hate at me but I feel that this movie has no
Mind blowing 😳
Ladies and gentlemen, the movie opens in 3 months! It looks great  Glad we are shifting the focus to how everything started and more of Djimon’s character  Although I wish they still called this A Quiet Place Part 3
Ela filmdi ❤❤
👍👍
Can Sony at least keep the cat alive :(
Mükemmel 😮❤

Is that Papa Midnite from Constantine?
i was expecting to see more of those creatures, and that end of the trailer shuck me "That's So Many Of Em!"
HooeeeKayeeee
I'd like to book the aliens to visit my neighbourhood on a saturday night.  The housing crisis would be over in an hour with the vacancy signs saying, quiet people only need apply.
So excited😱😱😱
Super film😮
Lupita bu rolü üstleneceğini şimdiden söyleyebiliriz😮

no thanks
the question is, do we actually discover why the world went quiet or is it another installment than explains nothing?
now we're going to see one of the creatures get hit with a tank round in one scene
It makes sense they couldn't make a part-3, with how they found a way to stop the horde. But I'm always game for anthologies.
Poor Eddie. It's one monster after another with him.
Kenyans in the house 🇰🇪
The sound they used was very very similar to Alien Covenant's. Has anyone noticed? 01:26
All movies with black people?I'm stop watching.....
a movie for africa ?
It's amazing trailor i swear i not see the trailor 😅
Ssshhhh🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
Here comes the SJW garbage
I’m sorry, but the deaf people would be one of the first to go.
lupita gon EAT THIS UPPPPP
Fantástico! Ansioso para assistir! As expectativas são as melhores!
Wikis me again with lupita 💩 she’s a f 💩 pseudo actress !!!
I am so worried for the cat
So thats a prequel i thought its a sequel
Maravilhoso esses filme super indico ❤😊
Sorry to say but this deviates from the original so much. It feels like a cashgrab done by Michael Bay or something. Gonna skip.
Never watched any of the previous ones but interested in this one so may have to find and watch the others before I watch.
Small detail-Anyone ever notice the same sound whenever text popped up in the trailer is the same sound as the ship alarm in alien covenant
JOHN KRASINKI IS SUCH A UNDERRATED DIRECTOR; ONE OF THE BEST USES OF FOLEY EVER
Already had a quiet place day one, this is just a cash grab
So since Djimon is in this one, I'm assuming these are the people that are going to be on the island that were in the original movies but obviously Lupita doesn't make it after a few films
Filme top !
1:08 is a cgi face??? why???
The cat better lives.
Признаюсь я заинтересован.
The cat knows its in the arms of a character who has the shield of plot armor.
Объединить в одном фильме идею нашествия пришельцев и планету обезьян - так себе идея...
When actors make a film interesting, that's the only reason I'd watch this movie.
oldukça başarılı ve nefes kesici
Güzel film
Lupita probably won’t make it and the sequel they’re gonna tap into the tornado sirens..
1:26 isn't this the ALIEN movie sound?
Anyone else notice the diversity hire?
Can there be monsters too to eat anyone who goes chatty or answers phone while inside the cinema?
Finally
straight-up mayhem this time, looking forward to it
This looks great!
Hay un gatito noooooooo😭
I really hope there are just thousands upon thousands of these things attacking earth. Because I can’t really fathom how our militaries lose so quickly, I can understand massive losses right in the beginning because we simply do not know what we’re dealing with and the confusion alone would lead to a lot of casualties. But there’s simply no way we would get overrun by these things if we just fought from the sea and air, even if they can burrow underground as we saw in the first movie. I also really hope we don’t get a ton of answers of where they came from and what they are. The mystery of these aliens and their backstory is precisely what makes them intriguing to begin with, so it’s super important to NOT give that information away. We know their weakness and that’s all that really should matter.
And ofcorse now the actors are black…

❤
The cat better is live!
Hope the kitty is okay
Is this a russian invasion? Rashists
LOL I'd like to see how the Russian jets figure in.
Never expected this to get a trilogy but I'm not complaining 😂
how do we know this won't really happen?
The cat needs to survive D:
They should have made this into a show.  Could have been bigger than the walking dead. But with the silence could be annoying to watch hand gestures all day
Yes finally the prequel
I'm here for it!
Oh this is cool. A prequel is interesting!
OH!! SH@% !!!
Was that a wild Alec Utgoff I spotted or just a lookalike?
A cat 🐈
the only important thing: the cat has to survive.
As long as the cat survives I'm okay
Esse vai ser bom, mal posso esperar o lançamento
Mal posso esperar por esse, tem uma história legal 😍
I can’t help but think this is a first wave attack . Aliens using their own planets predators . Then at some point the Blind Doggo’s masters will arrive .Cool movies .
Parabéns John Krasinski... Você fez isso🎉
IT'S BACK BABY !
why black main actors?
Why not just look at sea & water global temperature graphs. It's just as scary, if you know how to read them.
Am I the only one seeing what happening here😂
Schwarze Hauptdarsteller?
I will actually go to the movies and see this.  They give us clues to the future.  I want to learn to survive.  Yes, I'm a conspiracy theorist, as some call it.
If the cat dies I will not go see this film
they're not known for being quiet.
When is this dropping
Nice that they are milking this whole series out
We got a small backdrop on how they landed on part 2, I want to see how they start fighting back!
woke trash
Earth has been ringing the Dinner Bell for over 70 years so in a bubble extending out in every direction over 70 Light Years and expanding from the Earth continuously ... anything intelligent will know we're here now in that bubble!  I realize these are infested in meteors in this movie but imagine if something else uses them to clean a planet before colonization?
Maybe this is why the Galaxy is Quiet!
excited about this one, hope Krasinski returns for a little Part of the Film.
Muito bom
350,000,000 fire arms in the US and these things are a problem?
There had to be a version for black people 😂
But what happened to her cat?
From loud to silent, now it's from light to black...
This guy is really holding on to this movie😂😂
I don´t like scary movies, bleh ...
Wasn't this movie made already? ... Several times!
1:26 - 1:30 So "Alien : covenant".🤔🤨
This movie finna be tuff
Best Trailer of the YEAR... LOVE it
I can't rememer the last time a trailer actually got me so hyped for the movie!!!
Joseph Quinn 👍
I guess Hollywood couldnt handle the fact the first 2 movies didnt focus on black people
Is that mig 29 fulcrum ???
they blackified a quiet place
definitely can't wait to watch. Best horror sci-fi  movie of all time!  and excellent choices of actors as always 🎉🎉🎉
Niceeee
RIP my brothers that just finished the meanest 5 layer bean burrito right when the aliens landed
I was just thinking of Lupita🌊
*People like me with asthma💀💔*
Milking this franchise to death.
Oh cool a new annoying noise that repeats throughout the trailer, thats never been done before.
predictable
I just don't think they should have went backwards
I love the first 2, I pray they don't disappoint us with part 3
This trailer is a blatant ripoff from the ALIEN 1979 Trailer 😂
Cant wait to see how all of our fire power gonna handle them
Me gusta
so cool
Should have stopped at the first one. It is clearly going downhill like most prequels and sequels nowadays.
Ok this movis is on my list!!!
love it
Cant wait for June ❤❤❤
Please tell me the cat lives, I wont be able to watch if they dont
People who watch the first and second movies and Love them and is pumped for this one 👇👇👇
1:26 is the noise from Alien: Covenant
Создатели первой части заинтриговали зрителей . Мы смотрели фильм и думали ," откуда они взялись? " . Потом, вышла вторая часть . Киностудия приоткрыла тайну , но не полностью....   Это отличный ход со стороны продюсера и режиссёра. 👍
Does the cat survive
Easy script. No dialogues😂😂😂      Just kidding
The only way I'll watch this film is if I know the cat survives.
Who would win in a fight...    Hundreds of Thousands of those Creatures    Or...    A Clown with a stop sign
Just another movie that puts black people in an already established series to appeal to people through "diversity" even though the diversity only includes black people and no other ethnicities or people from different countries. HARD PASS on this movie.
So many apocalyptic movies these days, what a way to feed the collective conciousness directly to doom..
When Lupita is added just know it’s a hit movie 😮‍💨🔥🙌🏽
I love the series but the visual effects here do not seem be on point. The cgi is too obvious. Lets see if it improves on the final version.
looks promising!
👍👍
But, part 2 allready showed day 1 right?
A woke place the beginning 2024
This looks 🔥
will there be a sequel to the second part?
I would never survive this cause I snore 😂
We are simply NOT equipped to deal with any Alien invasion, without resorting to our self killing mega very dated weapons Nukes.
Ready to feel chapter 3. Really enjoy chapter 1 and 2. Like it!
MEOW MUST SURVIVE
hey, we have no ideas - let us recook everything again and again, they will swallow it anyway
Footage from the Russian Airshow at 1:00 - is it a mistake, or is it intended?
se ve épico
So.... no part III? What was the point of the whole Part II part?
I'm so ready to see this movie
I don't get it. If that had been happening for hundreds of days, why didn't the people in the other ones hear about it?
Woah, awesome movie
The monster, his name is death angel
Not the cat
🙄
I'll watch this one.. but not yet. Not yet.
Mehn, this gave me chills
My MPAA Prediction: PG-13 for intense violence and terror, frightening images and some language.
I want to see the military at least putting up a decent fight
This is end times
Can't wait to sell my left kidney to watch it!!!👁️👄👁️✅

Right!…taking a already perfect directed movie franchise by John Krasinski and make it woke and ruined 👌if you can count on one thing it’s taking something perfect and ruining it with a woke spin off gotta love it 👎
Starts with a cat.                     You got me.
Yaaaaaaas....
Those very things are real ! Don't you see ! There warning you about the things soon to come ! It's more than aliens that exist ! Wake up before it's too late
So they just redid the second film but with a higher ESG score.
So happy for Joseph he's broken intp bigger acting roles!!
Garbage movie.
That annoying repeating sound alone guarantees I won't watch this yet another cr/ap!
I do like Lupita NYong'o 😊
30 of the Last Days of Earth
One Day Last Days of the Earth
I thought it was a comedy satire from the thumbnail 😑
I thought the dad died
checkin those boxes
one of the best movies of all time .....and this looks incredible
This franchise just ripped off the show Primeval. Look up Primeval season 1 episode 6 from 2007, and you'll see the writers of A Quiet Place just changed the skin tone and head shape of the Future Predator and acted like it was their own idea.
Free Palestine!
Definitely watching this
DEI
I want to believe this isn’t the last “A Quite Place” we will be seeing??  June to me seems like next year. Can’t wait 😊
June???😳😳😳really???🙄🙄🙄
I thought this movie already existed?
The body of Christ left. The lights went out. 1 Cor 15:1-4

Seronok kan jumpa balik sahabat lama muka macam tu.. orang baru tak tahu..hmmm..
Woahh!! Finally 😭
Migrants
From deja vù science fiction, alien invasion, with black protagonists to give it an air of newness. Cute!
The first time without Emily Blunt being main character
I loved the quiet place i am so happy
Imagine farting and an alien eats you
if the kitty dies, we riot
I think I've seen this trailer and the movie already - although I haven't.
I hope that the cat makes it through the whole movie
They have a cat--THAT CAT BETTER SURVIVE THIS MOVIE!
meh
I will literally just watch this movie for the cat, if it dies I’M THROWING MY COMPUTER
There is a cat, he or she better survive!
Ooooh, I'm so excited! I love the Quiet Place franchise, although I did hate when the little boy died, and when the dad/husband sacrificed himself in the first movie!!!
Lupita❤❤
Do we need to see what happened when it was already explained in the original movies from newspaper pages? They came, were indestructible, follow sound and killed almost everyone.... pointless movie.
1:25 This creepy music actually came from Aliens Covenant called Spores.
In a Quiet Place 1 and 2, it's been years and yet still no military, no rescue, no reinforcements. A Quiet Place Day One shows why. The military were all in the cities where urban areas were prioritize for exterminating these things. The rural population we see in part 1 and 2 were all left on their own.
Really stole that alien covenant music there eh. Big time. Wasn't even subtle 😂🎶
fr that be me if this happened running with my cat
The things that we are about to see are the fiction that was already reality.
did I see Jim Halpert in the begininng of the trailer?
It's so dangerous
It's so dangerous😍🤩
is the cat will be okay? cz if the cat died or get injured I don't want to watch it even if I love this movie :(
Bro i Gonna get really jump scare of this film
Let us pray for those who snore..
I’m not watching this film because I don’t like the man Lupita whatever her name is is dating
I'm going to take a wild guess and say that Lupita didn't survive. Only the people from the other movies survived
#KeepThatKittyAlive!
finally a leading role again for a well deserve actress!
Wow wow wow hats off to the makers ...no matter how many parts they bring the thrill and scary level are the same in all! Gonna watch this for sure..can't wait❤
The budget is budgeting
No thanks. I'll pass on woke WEF/UN garbage. Maybe this movie should be released in Africa?
that just felt so stragne it had a looks like america but filmd in the uk vibe.
My friend took me to see the first one and it was the most boring film I've ever seen. It was almost as stupid as Bird Box. My wife and I laugh, just mentioning Bird Box.
shhhhh shhhh shhh, we have to be quiet.
Okay I’m very excited for this
You know this movie is gonna be intense when they had to get the African gym owner from the movie “Never Back Down” who trained with the Gracie family 😂
Did valve made this movie
Looks like a bunch of BOX ticking woke crap
Djimon Hounsou is back baby!
Dehşet verici 😮
Save the poor cat
Great.. they Jordan Peele’ified a quiet place 🙄
PLS LET THE CAT LIVE IM SO WORRIED I ONLY SAW IT IN ONE SCENEEEE...
Day zero/one of every apocalyptic horror movie is always the most intriguing in my opinion so I’m really looking forward to thjs
John Krasinski is in his BAG this year!
🔥
Didn’t expect this movie to take place in New York City, I’m hyped
The whole concept is a masterpiece
This is the most interesting A Quiet Place so far.
woke 🤢
Fascinante o trailer, aguardando lançamento!
Is that a su-27???
the cat better survive the WHOLE movie
No one wants a prequel! Everyone wants a sequel
Um Lugar Silencioso e Não Respire são duas das minhas favoritas no gênero suspense/terror que surgiram nos tempos modernos! Recomendo.
ang ganda
Should be a short movie considering that blacks cannot shut up ever.
Tenso🎉
Yeeessssssss!!
كم هوا فلم رائع سوف أتابعه
Perfect film
Future me, will the cat survive?
I hope the cat will be ok.
On which OTT platform?
Bio-weapons sent from another world 😮
Imagine being hungry but the only edible thing you managed to get is a insanely noisy bag of potato chips..
So the monster went into the city? That’s cool
0:45 I’m sorry but that stock scream effect is just so distracting
Its a myth, an illusion and a strategy to keep the world scared of aliens while humans replace aliens in Gaza, and other places wherever humans are tortured and threatened by the same species. Grow up world! Know what they are doing to us thru movies. No aliens but human oppressors are and will be the greatest threat to the world.
Out of everyone, they had to pick a starving African chick?
just tell me the cat survives idc about anything else i swear
Another Alien Attack!😂
I actually like this take. Giving us a full story of how it all started and from different characters perspective.
Trailers muito top.
Ótimo filme.. suspense do começo ao fim
Nice one, I couldn't wait for this one, wish it would have been a series..
Excelent
❤❤❤
A nice movie 👍🏻
Sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum
Does anyone know when this release in h The UK?
Save the cat
Parece bem interessante, não vejo a hora.
looks like birdbox
Why does there have to be a cat? We all know it won't survive :(   Still looking forward to this.
Please let the cat survive
all the same movies then you see the monsters and its yawn
Woke trash    .. No thanks
Bom demais
Chill cat ..
JUNE!!!! I NEED TO WATCH THIS NOW!
İnteresting
Intenso, tenso e de arrepiar. Muito bom!
One thing I wonder is what is the a goal of the aliens? They don’t eat us or take any of our stuff. I have a weird theory a smarter race sent them to take us out perhaps and then come in, idk just a thought.
Amazing!
Muhtesem🎉🎉
Bom
Agrhhhh.....anjir
I literally held my breath for the duration of this trailer 😮 can't wait.
Can we fart if this happens ?? In real ...
❤❤❤
😮😮😮
Why are they repeating the second movie?
Is this a comedy film?
Oh seems interesting what the Caucasian family experienced (2) sequels hearing aid And baby stored n sound proof box  Now African American people experience of a quite place storyline
I think 1:30 is my favorite scene from this trailer
so... this movie is pretty much the same movie but told from a different view from another person in a more.. crowded/busy setting thus maybe making this a prequel. ngtl, i love this concept if this is the case cause imagine how deadly it was for a city, with stuff such as metro's, cars, etc in this scenario a whole buffet for these aliens/creatures
This looks insane
While I'm excited for a prequel, I also wanted to see a continuation of the first two since the daughter was split from her mother and brothers at the end of the second one, so we never got to see them reunite.

NOW!
Sound alien covenant
Just incredible
A Quiet Cloverfield.
Yay! Joseph Quinn go go go
slop
Protagonist knowing sign language is a great strategy plot wise
This is the Movie that should of came out first !!!
Shame, another one ruined with forced diversity.
but is the cat okay??
1:09 bro didn’t want to let her end his mewing streak
BLIND Aliens 🙄 🤦‍♂
👌👌🔥
I loved  Quiet place and Quiet place 2 so I know this bout to eat the movie theaters up ❤❤❤❤
She’s mute, im calling it
Que dia ,já lançou? Vai lançar?😮
Alien does not scare me, human does. 03/02/2024
The cat😢
TRAILER ON POINT
is it just me or i just heard the alien ost in this trailer btw i did love the train of monsters just passing by
Looks like israels
Too Late To Release.....I am waiting..........to Watch.....🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯
Muito boa essa série
Nossa Esse filme vai ser muito Bom! nao vejo a hora
That music is from aliens and Prometheus they jacked it
Ótimo filme
because of course, how can you have a movie now without some black person  as the lead right...... will never watch
I loved the concept of the movie. But it would have been much better if the creatures looked a bit more more realistic. In the first 2 movies, the creatures were looking animated.
Day472 izledim güzel beğendim tavsiyee 478
Ansioso para esse lançamento incrível 👏
Is this a legit preview?
Not to be critical.... but at the moment of 1:00, it shows Russian fighter jets. Now that could just show similar events happening around the world, but in the event its actually a shot supposed tobe in new york that very lazy and inaccurate film production
Muito bomm
Super recomendo assistir
Again Same nonsense lol
Filme muito bom
Filme muito bom prassiti nesse final de semana
Güzel bir macera filmi
Tüylerimizi ürperten bi kare her anı heycan verici
Bekliyoruz 🎉
Harkulade bi film gibi ❤❤❤❤
Muhteşem bir film ben aşırı beğendim
The CAT, The CAT 😫
I will watch it with pleasure on my free day
Abo
Excellent effects, sound and action
We finally get to see how the military f****d this up, and how it took a year to put together that creatures who hunt solely on sound can be incapacitated/blinded by loud enough sounds.
1serisini izledim mükemmel🎉
❤🎉
Evet lütfen bunu kaçırmak üzücü olabilir
Harika ❤ bir film❤❤ izleyin❤❤❤
See? Black people are always the strongest, bravest, smartest, best-est EVER! They always know the answer to the riddle, secret or clue. Hollywood needs to shove this false idea in every show the put out. More divisive garbage.
Looks Like A Cute Kitty Cat Joins Them  🐈‍⬛💖
Where are the ghostbusters?!  I believe we are in store for something like this, its only a matter of time.  😮
🇦🇶🇦🇷🏳️ No one is safe and secure except in heaven. Be well🖤🤍
Why have our protagonist, an Oscar nominated actress, one of the greatest actors in all of horror…carry a cat with her? AND WHY IS IT SO CUTE?! YOU’RE JUST PULLING MY HEART STRINGS 😢
Интересно, а зачем в трейлере американского фильма кадры пролёта пилотажной группы	"РУССКИЕ ВИТЯЗИ"??? Американцы вы хотя-бы это заметили?))))))))
Nothing better happen to that cat.
Nice
Excelente, curti demais esse filme e recomendo.
Os melhores filmes estão aqui
The trailee was so 🤫
Amazing job 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why not just walk everywhere you go? Boom minimal sound. Oops then we won't have exciting chase sequences I guess.
😂 gostei de mais
Top😮
😢 moito bom
1:19 moito bom 😮
I don't want to hope, but please let the cat live.
Had potential, turned into woke trash as usual.
❤🎉
1:26 sounds bit like alien covenant
Nah, that's WAY TOO MANY ALIENS dropping in one single place, this is an invasion to take the earth, dropping more of those things in big cities and a handful of them in small towns.
Was that a sanctuary city?
The 2 movies wasn't scary but in day 1 I always fair
this is one of the wordt movies i eve watched
2024 it's looks like will be fuckn amazing year for Hollywood movies
Wasn't there a white family in the movie. Dei ruined another movie. Removing all the white people in the world.
I just want the cat to survive until the end of the film!!
im happy as long as the cat survives in the end
amei
I WAS LIKE WHERE IS THE CAT NEAR THE END. BUT I SAW HIM SO ITS OK
Ansiosa para poder assistir esse filme
Filme top, faz tempo que não vejo um filme com tanta qualidade e ação. Nota 10
E muito bom o filme eu amei
Not much to say outloud about it 😂
Horror, thriller, action, wow
Esse filme é apocalíptico 😮
CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE ❤❤❤❤🎉
I wanna see this
What a beautiful trailer. I’m waiting as well soon
A worthy prequel 👌🏾
The anticipation for this movie is unreal, especially after the success of the first two. Can't wait to see how they continue to raise the bar with each installment!
In the first movie when the woman started giving birth in the bathtub and one of the creature slowly crawled inside the bathroom, that scene was intense. Can't wait for the 3rd movie.
Alien Covenant soundtrack??!?!?! 😂😂😂😂
I am definitely going to see this movie, but it sucks that you already know how it is going to end. With it being a prequel and all.
Os dois primeiros filmes foram perfeitos!  O elenco esta cada vez melhor 🎉
Is this a prequel
Bom de mais
Joseph Quinn better make it this time. All I'm going to say.
That's the man who lives in the island with other families which we have seen in Quiet Place: Part II
Adoro este tipo de filme
Muito bom
i need to know right now if the cat dies because it 100000% effects if i watch the movie or not
Gog and Magog - Yajuj Majuj
Finally a well done trailer that doesn't spoil the entire movie
if anything happens to the cat i am rioting.
I just want that cat should be alive at the end
I am so excited for this movie
Lupita BEING THE STAR OF THIS ONE!!! PRICELESS!!🤩🤩
BS
As a kenyan am happy to see one of us on big table🎉🎉
Mükemmel izlemenizi tavsiye ederim
But why their not attack each other they are so noisy as well😅
I have to see this. Lupita's my girl!
I’m already so scared for the cat. 😢
Illogical movie nonsense
I saw trailer in the Theater with my brother before I watched Madame Web, is very very scary. 😮😮😮 These things is kinda like from Resident Evil. I never see that trailer and this movie coming again.
Stay quiet
Salah satu film tanpa banyak bicara, tapi menguras emosi...
Ill wait till they finish the story they started with part 1 and 2. After that I may watch a film with characters not in the original story.
Wow it looks a great movie. Even if it wasn't part of such a brilliant series. Had no idea there'd be another!
Wow, hollywood - another boring movie...
I am super excited for this :D
Doubt animals survived at all .
Day One     ...or...     One Day
Now this is called prequel mind-blowing, eagerly waiting 🤜🏻🤛🏻
Filme espetacular, valeu cada segundo!
oh yehahhh
I think this one is gonna b the best out of all chapters❤
Nope
farklı ama güzel bide su meteor efekti falan 😮
Glad to see Djimon Honsou return.. he's always been a great actor. Always brings his "A" game.
Chat yapma işte diyorum noluyor böyle iste
Esse filme é muito bom😂

PROTECT THE MC AND THE CAT AT ALL COST
A Quiet Place: Black Edition
A Quite place One was all the deaf girls fault change my mind.
🔥🔥🔥
John and Emily becoming the new gen Ryan and Blake. Change my mind, we worship whatever they produce 😂 and call them gods for it
One man throwing an absolute rager of a party would allow any government to decimate every one of the sound monster monsters 😂
Stupidest concept for an alien series ever. You're telling me that nobody in the military would notice these creatures had super sensitive hearing, and attempt to use sonic weapons on them?
Esse é um filme de ação, gostei muito 😊
i am instantly hooked to the seat when the trailer started. looking forward to the movie
James is gonna have a field day counting this one
Parece ser ótimo muito efeitos especiais e ação  recomendo
holiimolyyyy! 🤯
Já quero assistir
Congratulations John Krasinski... You did it🎉
this looks better than the first two
oh, so this is what happened after ''the office'' ended
Do you know when we can have it in Greece?!
Great they put crows in it and make them the heroes...
UM DOS MELHORES FILMES DE SUSPENSE  QUE JA ASSISTIR.
I will definetely watch this in the cinema and not only once :D
Nice
No thanks. Too much wokeism.
Extraordinary backup script
I forgot the actors name but he’s in 2 and now we get to see how he got to the island, to bad we know his fate.
❤#lupita nyong'o🇰🇪🇰🇪
If anything happens to that cat I will walk out of the theater lol
Best 💥💣👌👏
harika bir film
nice
Perfect
I am not understanding this trailer i mean where is part 3 .... can  someone explain me
What if the cat suddenly meowing and invite that alien creature?
Tek kelimeyle muhteşem bir film senaryosu on numara
Tek kelimeyle harika bir film izleyin
I am sold....would watch this then the other two
ehh gonne be another gory movie
I hope the cat is okay
We want to see in India in Hindi translation
Please Realise in India in Hindi dubbed version
Nice movie waiting ✌✌
Love this but it would be even better if i didnt feel tiny and the camera getting wet isnt amazing but i still love it 😍😍🌧
War of the Worlds
Finally something worth seeing. Ironically I won’t be there. This seems more intense then the first two which had me in the edge of my seat.
The film done so well with white main characters for 2 films lets switch it up and do a black character this time around, have to get in that exclusivity.
Is that one guy Mark Zuckerberg?
Is Hollywood running out of ideas??? The sounds and trailer is giving Prometheus... very similar... they just tweaked and changed a bit...
Such a stupid concept. Monsters that rely only on hearing and when that was figured out NO ONE TURNED THEIR VOLUME TO 100? I mean my neighbor could easily wipe them out by himself when he is playing his guitar lol. Can't watch this with such a thought in my mind
Getting boring now
A Indian fan
I feel like this movie is just gonna flop because of the same reasons every other movie nowadays flops. Too many political messages being shoved down your throat. This movie has such low chances of actually doing well I would be genuinely surprised if this movie did well.
Netflix did a movie like this awhile back called The Silence. That movie was horrible. This one looks a million times better.
that cat better survive
Wish they turned this into a tv series
I liked the first two movies, but for me it feels weird that they ditched the family and introduced a totally different charachter for day one. Idk, would have been more coherent to stick to the story of the family i think. Anyway, lets hope for the best with this one. I want it to succeed too.
I can only hope that this cat will make it at the ending credit because I'm the person who don't tolerate movie animal deaths
This brings a whole new meaning to shut up
I already seen some of it but idk where
I have only one question: WHERE DID THAT WOMAN'S CAT WENT? IS HE OK?😭😭😭😭
a quite woke place
Ta aí um ótimo filme de terror que foge dos clichês desgastantes que estamos acostumados a ver na maioria dos filmes de terror.🎉❤
Siento que ya vi toda la pelicula en el trailer.
Can't wait to watch it from my home projector 😍https://shorturl.at/cBCPR
Bora assistir muito top galera 🙏
If the cat dies we riot
A quiet place has before and movies are actually a reality that some people will live in 🖤🤍.
Muito bom para quem gosta de terror e ação!
The best
Nggak bisa nih gue dia bawa bawa kucing😢🥺
Muito bom o filme gostei demais
Why do they have to black everything
That looked incredible
im so heppy 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
Ansiosa pra ver esse ❤
476 gün içinde süren macera dolu ve tuhaf yaratıkların insanları kovaladığı heyecanlı bir koşuş , acaba filmin sonunda o insanlar yaşayacak mı merak ediyorum. Benim gibi kendisine boş zamanlarda heyecan aksiyon filmi arayanlar için bir seçim olabilir 😂😂
If that cat dies....
Sinistro
Fantastik bir film
Güzel film
Would've been also cool if it was as found footage film
Technically it should be day 0
Awesome...loved both 1 & 2....cant wait for this!!!
Why would i want to see this? If anything show me why the aliens came.
Are we going to know where they came from to how they got here at the opening???
😊❤
What's about gases sound 😂
Of course….have to race swap
I won't be watching this, JACK CLARK I HATE YOU
Oyuncular şahane film efsaneee🤩
İzlediğim filimlerde. En iyisi bu
İlk defa izledim uzun zamandır izlediğim en iyi film serilerinden biriydi
Born and raised NYer here and I can't think of a scarier place to live if something like this ever happened. The amount of people condensed into small spaces (the streets, the subway) would be a nightmare. There's nowhere to go to escape
❤❤❤
I’m too excited for this movie✨
Genellikle dram filmleri izlerim film fragrani harika aksiyon icerikli begendim
Mükemmel
İzlemenizi tavsiye ederim süper yapit❤️❤️😊
One of the best movies I've seen these days. I would recommend it to everyone
This is a legendary movie in its genre. Really great and extraordinary visuals were used
This is a legendary movie in its genre. Really great and extraordinary visuals were used
Bu filmin 1. ve 2. sini izledim 3. Yü de bekliyorum bence gayet başarılı
Mükemmel
Devam fimi olmasının yanında yine gerilimi iliklerinize kadar hissedeceğiniz bir film😮
The real survivors: 🤫🧏‍♂
👍
Wbsone
Savaşın ortasında aile 😢
Como é nome do filme
No!! a cat!!! I love cats, was planning on watching it but if it dies ill probably leave it for another day..
Harikalar diyarında dama oyunu gibi bir müthis
Gerçekten verdiğiniz emeklerin karşılığını fazlasıyla alacaksınız
Harika bir sinema şöleni ekran başından ayrılmayacağınız bir film
İzlediğim en iyi fragman bu
İşte yine muhteşem bir proje izlemeye hazırım
Vay bilim kurgu tam istediğim gibi süper etkileyici flim
Bence oldukça başarılı bir yapım tavsiye ederim
Harika hikaye onu asla kaçirmatin 😉
Bu kadar buyuk bir butce ve sonucu muhtesem
👏👏
Süper 😊😊
Estou muito ansiosa para assistir um lugar silencioso, se os outros dois foi super emocionante essa versão não vai deixar a desejar.
Why do I hear prowler
Üçüncü Dünya Savaşı kıyamet gününde dünyanın sonudur Ya Rabbi, senin iyiliğin ve hoşnutluğun için
Wawo
Halpert my man
Please no the first one was garbage now you infest it with woke stuff? Gosh you are not doing well.
Can’t wait to see this one. The other two where totally scary. And realistically
I loved, the realism of the subject is legendary
This one looks a lot different somehow.
race swap, cash grab. next.
Being alienated and being around aliens hmmm
I liked the first two movies, its cool they can make this now they have a big budget
For some reason, my cat really likes the screaming noises at the beginning
Next alien invasion fake pedowood crap
Im more worried about the cat than everyone else
Potential. Aquired.
Um máximo de filme
Show
if that cat dies, Paramount.       *invest in explosive-proof doors cause i will be coming*
I have always wondered what happened to the army and how they were defeated
Finally one that we can watch and actually enjoy . That has a person of color starring in it !!!!!!
Wow, New  Quiet Place🎉❤
What no Jim 😂😂
Filme muito bom, um dos melhores de 2024❤
Maravilhoso o filme! Remendo demais.
Filme muito bom ! Remoendo demais.
Making two films are ready and then coming back and telling us why they were here is almost just as stupid as they can get
I hope the cat makes it out alive
Ótimo gráfico top de mais amei ❤
Horror😮
Can't wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice 👍
If the cat dies, I Am Legend is gonna have a contender.
Can't wait💓Lupita Nyong
Muito bom
Muito bom o filme
Top
Esse filme parece que vai ser muito bom 😮😊
Amei esse filme
Já estou ansiosa
Filme topado!
Esse filme parece ser muito bom de verdade estou louca para assistir 😊
Looks spooky, lets go!
It must happen in reality
🙇‍♀️💕 ”..wOw!”
Shhhh!
O trailer é tenso demais! Te joga de volta nesse mundo pós-apocalíptico onde o som é o pior inimigo. O John Krasinski tá na direção de novo, então dá pra esperar aquela qualidade top que ele mandou no primeiro filme. O trailer deixa todo mundo com o coração na mão, querendo saber o que vai rolar nessa sequência. A trilha sonora é sensacional, só aumenta a ansiedade! Esse segundo filme vai ser ainda mais eletrizante. Mal posso esperar pra ver como eles vão se virar nesse mundo onde até um barulhinho pode ser fatal.
Já estou ansiosa para eu conseguir ver esse filme só pelo trailer vai ser ótimo
A masterpiece movie
I dont think i will ever be bored watching these movies. I've watched them over and over again and I'm so excited for this one!!!
YOOOO there's a DAY ONE, now this is epic to watch
i'm very tired of blackwashed movies
I am so TOTALLY IN !!!!!!
where the cat go
This looks dumb.  Well made, well acted, etc. but just dumb.  I am wondering why they flashed a flight of Su-27s if this takes place in LA.
This movie has that vibe of I AM LEGEND.. can't wait!
Güzel
whats jim doin
June?!!! Really!!! I’m so mad 😡
Jesus Saves🎉
Don’t hide in the dark.  Come back. ❤
Something tells me this is going to be the number one block buster movie for this summer.👍👍👍👍
This is a true story !!!!
Looks promising
youre saying none of those americans had guns?
One of the top movie series of the past few years, more movies like this please!
Oh yea and Lupita in it this is definitely the one can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥
Another american hysteria
I will see it only for the cat
Ouuuuu ansioso pra assistir 😊
if that cat dies, boycott
IT ONLY TOOK 3 MOVIES TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING LOL WHAT A JOKE
Looking forward to watching the movie 🎥🍿.
The first one was absolute crap nothing even happens terrible writing, and now they go for and alien invasion money grab
❤
Again❤
Release date of this movie can any one tell me please

Na expectativa 😬😬
Lore
Really amazing
Comentar o que ?
I am waiting
Top chio de bola
про негров фильм понятно
Muuot top
I hate when movies cut out what started in the beginning this is what I like. I like to see the beginning of outbreaks for an extended amount of time not just skip to 10 years later 20 years later, blah blah blah
WE ARE NOT BREAKING THE MEWING STREAK WITH THIS ONE 🗣🗣 🔥🔥🔥🤫🧏‍♀
so they finally show the creatures? and was that cillian murphy ?
O filme é muito bom eu indico pra todo mundo acistir
Gostei muito bom é um dos filme eu gosto❤
Muito bom top demais
Yeah should have kept Emily and John. No thanks
I'm over it. All the franchise milking has become tiresome.
Cool can't wait for it to be out😊😊
Epic 😎👌❤
Muito bom
A Quiet Place: Joining the Panderverse...
0:42 something's off with the editing in this part.
As a fan of the first two I'm very excited to see how the Earth went quiet!! Then a final movie of taking Earth back!
For some reason, I think those aliens won’t mess with The Bronx😂
Muita ação esse filme parece o fim do mundo
Stop milking
oh jeezz🙄
Djimon Hounsou❤
Are these creatures related to the xenomorphs?
Imagine keeping a cat quiet 😂
Опять негробабы😮‍💨
Bomboclaaat 😮 this look bad yf 🔥🔥
looks meh honestly.
Can't wait to see ☺️☺️💕😍😍
honestly what the first sequel should of been
This is all that we wanted but we're on the third movie already, y'all messed up. Everyone's older now and doesn't care anymore.
Keren  banget
That cat there to ruim everything in cute way KZKSKSLZLZ
I just want the cat to survive.
0:45 the creature had someone in its hand! I’m ready for all of it!!!
already scared from trailer 🤫🤫🤫
Love this series.
what the faq? im here for the movie and Lupita and Joseph!!!
Why are they so mad though? Dafuq.
To be fair, everyone in new york is pretty much helpless and over all cant survive outside normal infrastructure so i expect this to be rather quick for that town.
Black woman has to stay quiet. What a horror!
Please tell me the cat lives
Why is it not called 'A loud place'?
did they just reuse the soundtrack to covenant?
Yes 🎉🎉
Seeing Jim Halpert on the first scene just distracted me from the whole trailer as I kept thinking if that was really him
But uhh... does the cat live
Isn't that the OST of Alien at the end?😮
yoooo im rooting for the cat to make it 😭
Im ready
Love that another is coming outtt
anyone else heard the "Alien Covenant" sound?
se acabaron las ideas de los creadores de contenido en el cine! mi mas sentido pesame y luego esta misma pelicula saldra en 2050. 2069, 2075. 2089 y asi...
garbage
Joseph Quinn?????

Interessante, ansiosa para ver!!! 🙂
Eh, didn’t they already cover the day 1 type thing in the second one… looks mid
As long as the cat survives, we’ll be happy.
No thanks.
Movie of the Year🔥
Ansiosa para assistir a esse filme já, se o trailer já é espetacular imagine o filme completo

This is what will happen now that the republicans have sided with Putin.
Nice ❤
Harika, çalışmaya devam edin, teşekkürler
At first, I thought it was going to be some woke stuff.
Müthiş perfect
Great trailer, I liked it very much, definitely watch it
Gayet güzel aksiyon dolu bi filme benziyor

The concept of these movies is so stupid these creatures would be driven insane on earth and how do they tell human noise from just natural noise
Wouldn't we see these meteors coming

👌👌👌👌
best life
Here we go, predict programming. they want us to Fear it and to believe this can happen while they plan it.
2024 yılına damga vuracak filmlerden olduğunu düşünüyorum 😊
This is the start
another disaster movie, great
The best demagorgan series' ever
Is this a Jordan Peele Collaboration? Lol
this year is insane for movies!
Cat wont survive this
Saya suka cerita awal mula one day, proses banyak manusia yang hilang di bunuh oleh alien.
They would get a quiet kick to the bollocks
Just 100 minutes of monsters killing people.
Why does it always have to be New York City which gets targeted by every super villain 😂
Djimon Hounsou to the resque!
nah what if i have to fart?
Nah I’d win
Spoiler: the cat will not survive.
I like the concept of the aliens but i dont understand something. The aliens have such a vulnerability to certain sound as revealed in the first movie, why humanity couldn't defeat them with just a giant speaker and loud noises?
Ok, never mind. This is my favorite movies Sirius ever!!
This is already a movie…
My number one most anticipated movies of this year
Day 1 universe? Count me in😂
Giving Me cloverfield vibes 👀
Why is New York City always getting attacked by everything and anything in movies and in IRL. 🧐
I thought we saw day 1 already.  We know how this happened.
0:30 I instantly thought of Transformers!
how can this alien species just block tomahawk or any missile guided or no guided as well as some heavy weapons is a mystery
Check out the Original Alien trailer from 1979 or the Prometheus trailer. Stolen sound effects.
YES!!! A Quiet Place has turned into a Trilogy!!! I admit, I was hoping to see what came ofter the events of the 2nd movie, but this will do. The guy at the end helping the woman is the guy who brought everyone to the island. I did want to explore more of how the island strong hold came to be, since it was explained in the second movie. Now we get more insight on that!
Oo
Please let the cat live. I don’t want to see the cat getting killed by those creature
man i can't wait for this one, i keep rewatching the trailer every couple days
😮
Oumphhh, so eventually you can't make a normal sequel and you need to put blacks in it, even though the idea was totally different. Jeesh!
❤❤❤❤❤
Doesnt sound that quiet better rework on it
Filme top demais, vale a pena assistir.👏👏👏👏
Wish this would have came out first and the other one the second time... but... I'll take it!  Seriously people, stop making a movie then doing a prequel.. it's start with how it started and end with how it ended. Easy.
Ugh - does anyone care?
Os efeitos especiais são muito bons...
meh, i can't take magical plot armoured aliens seriously where the entire military force of the planet is defenseless against
great another animal to worry about
It's about time we got some diversity in this franchise, I mean - a white family is so 2010's.
i was expecting to see a prequel to the first 2 movies showing how the family survived and dealt with the situation, maybe showing how they got the house all setup or something. what we got is pretty much a reboot with an entirely separate cast of characters and too many monsters and action scenes. the other movies were more of a slow burn horror/thriller
уже прошлая часть была откровенной галиматьёй
Waiting for it❤
Esse  bom
Based on the warjets, yes military action has been taken but hasnt worked. Its just a matter of time that a death angel is captured and experimented on for weaknesses tho. Then sonic weapons shall be made and with 50cals of *DIPLOMACY* the human race shall prevail.
I'm telling you right now, if the cat dies (which is likely) I will riot. That thing is adorable
i can't understand any quite place movies cause they talk too much .................
Dude, i thought quiet place is over for two movies😂. Now the dev bring it up to life.
Será um filme top
Ótimo conteúdo …
Same crap as the others. Womp womp
I love it
Korku adrenalin yaşatan yaratıklarla ilgili güzel bir film olmuş
😮😮😃😃Wow third part..🔥🔥
I think the monsters are a biological weapon sent by aliens to clear the planet to make way for colonization. They designed them to have super-hearing to be able to hunt in the dark, and so they could be easily killed by a signal when the planet is ready for colonization.
süper
Looks trash with too many blacks on screen 😂😂😂 it isn't scary anymore either since you show monsters constantly 😂😂😂
If the cat dies I won't watch it TvT
Oh I can’t wait!!!
can you guys shut up?
ATEEE
Is the deaf girl in this movie?
🔊 Nice „Alien“ / „Prometheus“ trailer sound-design reference! Love it!
Imagina no cinema esse filme se locoo 🤩
Başarılı
Everything what I will hear is a popcorn chewing
well at least we know where they came from
Fazla bütçe harcanmış konusu güzel merak ediyorum 😮
Bro can you imagine hiding...then dying because you farted?
Is John Krasinski still directing?
Kesinlikle Tavsiye Ediyorum ✨
Very nice
❤
Heck yeah!
knowing before that this movie doenst have an happy ending gives the invasion even more inpact
Bu film sizlerle olsun
sürükleyici bi film esinlikle tavsiye ederim
I just love it ❤❤
Harika bir film
Is this gonna be a prequel to the first movie?
Elinize sağlık
Is that japan it sorta looks like it
Fantástico!!!!
PROPAGANDA ENGONOSA ELES RECRUTA PESSOAS PARA COMENTA NO VIDEO E DAR LIKE E DEPOIS NAO PAGAM
This is not a movie this will really happen in future
😊
Film gayet iyi
Mükkemel bir film ❤
Looks so cool.
It would be really interesting to have some kind of web series following some of these aliens that landed in more remote areas of the world. Like I wanna see what one of these things would do to survive in the middle of a desert or on a smaller island.
My favorite movie
Güzel bir film
Very nice
Severek izlenecek güzel bir yapım ❤
Birincisinden sonra ikincisi de muhteşem olmuş 🎉
Gerçekten fragman hayranlık uyandırıcı
Super
Profesyonel ve muazzam
Yalnız oyunculuk aşırı kaliteli hayran olmamak mümkün değil
Nice a reading movie
İnanilmaz film filimde emeyi keçenlere tesekkür ediyorm harika aksyon dolu
Son ikisi muhteşem,bunu görmek için sabırsızlanıyorum 🤩
Yine efsana bir film hayata geçiyor
A Quiet Place: Day One" promises to be a gripping continuation of the thrilling saga established by its predecessor. Exploring the origins of the terrifying creatures and the post-apocalyptic world they inhabit, this film offers audiences another intense and suspenseful experience. With its emphasis on silence and survival, coupled with strong performances and masterful direction, "A Quiet Place: Day One" is sure to keep viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.
Aksiyon dolu keyifli bir filmdi ❤

GAAAHHHH need this NOW!!!!!
These things might be strong but they ain't strong enough for a tank or 5bmg the armor is not that thick and ever heard of concussion?
wonder if the monsters are black too. for diversity
I can't wait.
I hope this becomes a series.  Or at least have a "Last Day" chapter where Earth fights back.
I can't wait to see part 3 frfr!!! 💯 💯... part 1 was incredible and part 2 was so incredibly sad and uplifting. The preparations for her delivery and their survival and the scene of her giving birth and how it all unfolded 😔 and the scene of the dad screaming/sacrificing himself for his family 😔 😢 😔 😢..  And then part 2 picking up where it left off while showing the backstory as well!! This is how you tell a visual story at its finest frfr!!!! I love everything about this movie from start to finish frfr. The visuals, the actors, the direction of photography *Chef's Kiss* 😘 💯
Used that Alien: Covenant soundtrack at 1:25. Nice touch!
Can't wait
Never understood the hype behind this universe pretty plain Jane to me...
I would love it if there was some type of queen or something.
If something bad gonna happen to the cat, the producer will only have to pray for his life.....
why there is Alien Covenant sound where the logo appear ????
Hopefully they can explain how the entire combined force of the US military couldn't beat an alien race that could be taken out with a broken hearing aid.
Going to see this because I adore these two actors
Well we were all hoping and now we are receiving what looks like another John Kransisky masterpiece! This is a nice turn from the first two, because we already know what happens in they're small little town, but now we get a glimpse of what happens in a big city with lots of people, and A LOT MORE NOISE!😱
bro wanted to be in the movie again so he made a prequel lol.
Pls no not the cat
Birdbox was much better
bosan, seharusnya buat lah episode secara berurutan, dari yang awal lanjut ke akhir episode..
Tbe Kingdom of Heaven is at hand . Yahuah is Mighty  creator and Yashusa is King . They know the truth .
I know it's just a movie but I'm already sad for the kitty!!!😭😭😭😿
I'm gonna say what everyone is thinking.  Nothing better happen to that cat.
New York is literally the perfect setting for these types of monsters 😂 and Lupita??? Omfg I can’t waiiiiit
DIS LUKS SO GUD  hello, internet
Waiting for movie❤
Help me help me gets tackled by monster
looks super scary . the guy from the office is there.  it's like I am legand and the mist
Amo  filme  que  tem  muita  ação
❤Beautiful❤ 😻
Another woke stuff.
I just want the cat to make it😢.
this is going to be great.
Cillian Murphy? Lets gooooo fire
Give me a break.
If the cat dies I’m leaving a bad review
yaaa mwone pwoli 💎
Deve ser um filme excepcional, aguardando chegar no Brasil!!
Esse filme será muito bom 💯🫵
Are we going to see why the military couldn't just fly helicopters and blast music until they went deaf? And how they somehow failed to figure out they had a weakness to sound despite the huge R&D capabilities they'd have?
We all know that the cat is gonna survive right? 🥹
😮
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Im so excited.   I started watching due to John Krasinski and Emily Blunt....love these two actors.   Looking forward to seeing this even though Krasinski isnt in it......he started this.
Days sad
White face in the trailer is crazy 😂
pueden hacer mil peliculas de este universo que las voy a ver a todas jsjsjs
The most ridiculous script in the world 😂😂😂 Blind aliens, but they want to destroy everything that ....what ? Sounds ,breath  ??? If these aliens are attracted from footsteps what about the animals  ? Oh yeah, they killed them all. Okay,  what about the sound from the wind, the ocean, the trees and what about the BIRDS 😂😂😂😂 ? Crazy Hollywood script writers,  cut smoking these mushrooms 😋
Muito da hora
does anyone notice Harry style
Parece incrível
nice i was thinking they done the movie in last one
I just hope the cat will live till the end of the movie🧿
This will be amazing guys 🎉🎉
Recomendo.
if there is a cat in this film, i ain't watchin
Lupita is perfect for this role. When I look at her eyes she does not need to say anything and I can feel what she feels. Which is perfect for this movie when you can’t hardly speak.  Also I hope we find out more about the comet and aliens abit more or hopefully in next film.
That part where they sit and watch as the creatures ravage the streets is terrifying and awesome.   Also considering the way these films go i hope kitty makes it to the end game.
Ótimo filme! Recomendo...galera.
This one is more interesting than part 1 and 2 can't wait to see Quite place 3 🤔😏
just came here to see the AI generated comments from bots
Let's go!
This might bring me back to the theater.
Heyecan ve aksiyon 🤩
Aman tanrım🎉
Looks even better than the last!
Yesss can't wait
Ansiosa pela estreia❤❤❤❤
Great. Now I want to watch the movie just to see if the  cat survives. (Hope the furrball does).
Süperr
That looks terrifying.
Bayılıyorum bu filme
My two part completed. Im waiting dish part 👽👽. Very denger movie 😢
Que aflição este filme, parece tão real, deu medo e agonia!
Harika birşey bu
Parece ser incrível estou muito ansiosa
How are you able to fast forward the video to the exact spot you want to go??  Just yesterday I was able to press on to the end of the video and then go there and now all of a sudden I have to wait until the end of the video which takes a few minutes. How do I skip through the video?
karens died first in day one....
As a cat lover, the only one things that i always thought since i noticed the cat being held were, where was the cat when the artists were busy hiding from the creatures, and how could the cat be trained so professional like a human cast?😭If i were the artist who owned the cat im this film, i'd rather be died for my cat

😮😮😮😮
the main character is black, what a surprise. up to date with the agenda
Shiiieeet
🔥
looks great
Gak habis2 ni film endingnya 😂😂
The amount of bots and fake accounts commenting is ridiculous
Can't wait to see Day two. also Day Three, and why not day four perhaps week 52 as well
this is some out of the box thinking, bringing us back to the first day of the invasion but from a different perspective, i feel like this one will be more suspenseful and bring out the true horror of these creatures
Lupita performance can't wait to see it😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
OH WE WOULD BE WATCHING
RIP for all ppl who snore
Harika görünüyor. Uzun zamandır bekliyorum. Beklediğine değecek sanırım. 🎉
Wait so it's not about the family that we know and love? What a shame.. I hope they don't just ditch them
Only gonna watch this if the cat survives. 😗
Whoa, sick man!
I'm not trying to be mean or terrible about it, but I wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie like this, I'm sorry, but I just feel like I've seen better.
I seen part 1 and part 2 now they are making part 3 but now we really  What really happened when the apocalypse started and I can't wait for part 3
as long as the cat lives ❤
Looks really silly.
Slightly bummed the original cast isn’t going to be in the new movie 😭😭
The cat was just “there”
What happend to chapter 3?
Paramountpictures your advertising was deafening. How can you legally make my tv hurt my ears? Peircing noises like that should be outlawed!!!
Not enough black people in the first one, so of course they had to do another one just to add a black person.
Why a black woman though. Give me a pretty blonde. Sometime, you know, actually worth looking at.
Alien invasion? Sure. A quiet black woman? Absurd.
Djimon and Lupita. Great actors. But Lord the beautiful features - eyes, nose, cheekbones on these two had my attention
I love the fact that this prequel is taking place in a metropolitan city, because I always wanted to see what the invasion looked like in Manhattan, New York.
Based on the past 2 being in top 10 for me this is gonna be amazing. Can't wait!!
i will always find it so funny that they simply reclaimed the alien covenent soundtrack lol
Looking forward to seeing this
When it come out
Prequel?
is cinema 🚬🗿
Eu so to me importando e uma coisa O GATO
Of course
i can't wait😂
why do they have to bring an innocent cat into this
The screaming part was annoying. This movie reminded me of WWX..the Zombie movie with Brad Pitt. But instead of Zombies,we have Aliens on Earth.But will definitely see it . Since I liked WWZ and  this movie will be as crazy dramatic too.
Looking for similar movies. Help
The cat's gonna win an oscar fr
❕
Daora
Has a bigger budget Cloverfield vibe to it. Has potential!
🤫🧏‍♂️
A whole new cast? Meh
Ok nice. So it was thousands of them, that came to earth. Cool
Ótimo recomendo
Muito bom o filme
can't wait!!!
Wow, girl is still holding on to that cat.  My cat would have scratched my eyes out already.  I'm assuming that's a real cat.
So long as the cat's okay 😺
be quiet🤫🫢
jancuk... ini kliatan lebih greget dari seri sebelum²nya
Erm 😂
i thought the premise of the first movie was to establish that a few land in rural america (as john has stated in interviews).  i guess we are retcon-ing the storyline?  ummm ok.
Its always exciting when its first dau of the disaster. The horror is so real
Normal day in Gaza at the moment.
Babies. The true terror of A Quiet Place.
Maravilhosoo
As a blind alien creatures they are smooth not to hit buildings, cars etc
Estou ansioso para assistir!
Movie was a waste of time.
Another alien attack on American land 😂😂
BS
A character we have no attachments too and one who was in the last film for about 10 minutes .. Hollywood why do you do this?
My vision.
Movie theaters on the Black side of town hit hardest
1:00 Sukhoi fighter jets lol.
Would love to see John again
Only a genius could think of something like this 🤣🤣 yeah right gimme a break. Dumb concept.
Just realized this, some animals would be exctinct because of those beasts, some make alot of noise
Vajon leküldték őket valamilyen kapszulában vagy hogy értek földet? Zuhanást nem élhették túl. Erre lennék kíváncsi
Esse filme será épico! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The thumbnail looks very ai generated
Oh great. Another lame prequel. Prequels are a waste of time.
Wow much more nicer
before 9/11 many movies like "independence day" were relized showing NY destruction.. and you keep going with that tonic.. so i dont know,, but i really can feel that you are seeking somehow that result.....so ..watch out
Who felt like king Ghidorah)
lol predictive programming = Alien Invasion
👏👏👏👏👏 aguardando esse filme
What buffs do you use?
Where's the cat you were carrying?!
The first two movies were perfect. I cant believe how they keep making it  better with each movie also the casting keeps getting better and better too. I am so excited for this!!!
So this is just an ethnic quiet place? I mean c'mon she's even doing whiteface... Really???
if the cat not gonna survive no thank you
I hope that cats okay
A bit of Jed Kurzel's Alien: Covenant score for the title screen? I like it.
Sometimes the world needs to be silent
They should make something like this for the tomorrow war
Available on Netflix
Muito bom o filme.
Wow!!! Seen the other parts. Cant wait for this one
I see this movie is getting darker and darker
If the cat dies, I’m not watching this movie.
Another sequel... 😐
Looks like they have up the intense and creeper levels.
Very great😊
O treiler  e muito bom❤❤
сюжет абсолютно глупый. Ага, прилетели они из космоса внутри метеоров))) долго летели? пару тысяч лет?))) а можно узнать - почему они там не замерзли? вы в курсе, что в космосе -300 градусов? сценаристы, хватит кормить нас мусором
The place is very noisy accompanied by the sound of sirens, Pinoy Fans🇵🇭⭐️⭐️⭐️🇵🇭💪🏻😎🦊
This year gonna be Joseph Quiinn’s era!
The movie is legit, it wasn't made by the fans, it's a sequel to Quite Place, I'm excited to watch it, Pinoy Fan here 🇵🇭⭐️⭐️⭐️🇵🇭💪🏻😎🦊
All I want to know is why so much on "day one" all over again after "A Quiet Place 2" started off with Day One also in 2020. The baseball field scene. The old man was watching day one happen also. It should have been a "A Quiet Place" New York Site". I'm just saying you guys already used day one even if it was for a second. I love the movie. Maybe to much to where day one should have not been dejavu but more so focused on NY. I'm just saying.
kaan hain kya hain ek dam  aajata hain ....
Envolvente , instigante, de prender o fôlego literalmente,!!!❤❤❤❤
Those screams being turned into music was cringy af lol.
THE CAT BETTER LIVE I SWEAR
Estávamos só esperando por esse filme...top
Mükemmel bir film
this is what the people of Gaza facing.
I was always wondering where it started and now finally the beginning!🖤
Every movies only first two parts are only amazing
Ohoo this would be mental...I liked pretty much the first two movies and the tension they've brought on to the screen. Hopefully this would be again a nice movie to watch.
Cuando sale?
When playing silent  game with aliens
Can this be the last one please we don’t need a seven-part series
Can't wait to see lupita, I love her acting since she joined in Us movies
why actor black people???
She got the cat. So she will survive
It'll  be better than the first one imo.
the cat💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Marco beltrami 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow
Nooo the cat!!
Defend das furher bunker
OH BOY! ANOTHER DIVERSITY HIRE FILM, CAN'T WAIT! 🤩
It should've said from the producers of ouija, songbird, project almanac and the purge.
Another movie where the main character is a black woman who’s superior to men again! Ugh no thank you! Crap
How about if I get sick if this happens in real life 😂
They're really milking this franchise.
😮
Of course if you dont put a black person in a franchise yore not ok dotn waste youre time
Awww the cat looks so cute.  I hope they make it out alive.
Didn't they already cover day one in the last picture?
At :43 when the alien jumps down it's holding a body like a rag doll!!  Ugh!!
ah now super black be the main character
All aboard the hype train
Another attack has only been targeted on America 😪
Why does the Alien Covenant soundtrack play at the end?
Sin palabras...
1:00 those are Russian air force aerobatic planes lol
Silence is golden 🔕
To be honest, the trailer got no soul of "a quiet place"
No Jim no watch
yes
Djimon is int it!? great actor... this man does not age a bit 🤣
Uma agonia que não tem fim esse filme realmente o melhor
THE CAT 😩😭
People in my street would be screwed!
I can't wait to see it 😂😂😂😂
The first two were bangers and I absolutely plan on seeing this one, too! The Quiet Place and Don't Breathe franchises are two of my favorite suspense/thriller franchises to have come out in modern times!
I hope the cat survives
I hope nothing happens to fluffy!
1:26 Why this sound like the same OST of Alien Covenant ???
More Hollywood trash.
CANT WAIT FOR THIS!
https://youtu.be/S88KggfqdFM?si=-qo8H83mEcV7R_t2❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wrong way in the time line.
F* yes haven't had a fun end of the world movie since birdwatch
I was just looking at the kitty cat
1.10 to 1.30 ultimate
The thing I love about prequels is that if done well it makes you want to go check out the movies that follow that you had for some reason never seen. This is going to be one of those movies.
NITHING BETTER HAPPEN TO THAT CAT
Lupita nyong o? I remember the GI Joe jokes dude. 😂
I love it horror movie am so excited
I feel like trailer have barely changed their layout since 2011
When is it Gunna be released
please let the cat live
I really hope the cat survives
Wow! I wish "Bird Box" having a New Movie too
Nice one
Love thid kind of movie where you work on your survival instinct
Lol
All the gushing comments here are a bit suspect...
Muito bom
Lupita Manze umeweza kwa him movie much love from Kenya
❤❤
Dumb premis to a movie. Cant beleive they milk a whole franhise out of it.
The reason I'll visit a movie theater.
This is happening in real life right now, but with immigrants.
Imperdível
You all will be living the movie soon..  Get right with the LORD quickly... Get "sealed", so these demons are not allowed to harm you, they can not...
JUNE?!?! Why do they do this to me 🥲🥲🥲🥲
Quiet place 2 showed day one but from a small town standpoint. This will be when they first hit a large City. Same premise different perspective.
I found the first two films incredibly boring, not scary at all & the cast was rubbish apart from the daughter. This one looks fire though.
This had me on the edge of my seat. Nothing beats the incredible soundtrack, atmosphere, screenwriting, and construction of this film from the ground up.
Why not continue with Emily Blunt's character?
Amo de mais ❤
Seeing too many of the monsters takes away thr interesting fear factor of the series
This movie remind me my dream every night
I wonder what happens when you fart in sleep in this movie
Bem assustador, mas o fim dos tempos não está longe e com certeza coisas assustadoras acontecerão.
વાહ મજાં આ ગયાં.....
Junii? lamaa sekalii
for every like ill do nothing
No more city noise. Problem solved.
Smart move to go back to day one, see how it all began. Have so much to work with. I’m all in. Can’t wait
It’s so scary how it reminds me Palestine.
cant we just have a movie with white people anymore?
love this movie
Действительно, забыли с меньшинствами снять
Who is going to watch it because of the cat????
The first thing I thought, I hope the cat is okay, lol!
Note to self: never never ever again watch a trailer for "a quiet place day one" while parked in an underground parking garage waiting for traffic to clear.  *shudder*. *furtive glances*
is the girl mc is the mc of bogeyman?
Woaaah
Bring it on 🔥🔥🔥
My balls farted
that sound... it sounds familiar to me; from Alien Covenant/Prometheus
Replacemant as usual... yawn SoS yawn...
The looooreeee
yes!! it's Djimon Hounsou. love the man since blood diamond. WHAT IS LEFT!?!? ughh, so epic
Another “color” movie 🙄 More like a black place🤢🤮
Dude this movie series just proves how a movie series should be made. No cash grabs, just a coherent story for the love of making the story
great gotta watch some diversity hire..
This is a very different and best story movie. Salute to the thinking of the writer and even more to the producer who supported this story and invested money on this story.  ￼
Looks like a cash grab. No more John and Emily, forced black cast, this is going to suck.
Tell me why Hollywood sucks without saying why Hollywood sucks
No way
I’m sorry I feel like they really milking this 😂
The 2nd one sucked ...so this must be the woke version now.
https://youtu.be/TrI5AmuklMI?si=HtRMn9Fgm3vlVjak
Stories been told, nuff said.
woooooooooooo
It will be terrible
Russians @1:00🤔. Showing the fight around the world huh? Cool!
Someone tell me the cat survives
WHERE IS HER CAT???
yall realize that you never get to see the actual downfall of humanity in apocalypse films? it usually just shows us life a few months or years after the aliens come so I'm hella excited for this
Day 1 of Emily Blunt's Botched Botox Experiment. Shhhhhhhh. Be quiet!!!
the cast reminds me of Planet of the Apes
Where did the cat go 😭
Whys the music giving me chills bro😅
i neededdd
Hf 😮this one's gonna be absolutely insane ❤
Now that's how you do a trailer
hollywood obsession with putting bl4ck actors everywhere
Meh
Yet another POS hollywood garbage.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
the sounds in this trailer  are heavily influnced by prometeheus trailer. It works ,but still kinda unoriginal
Idk, first one was cool. Didn’t care for second one. To be honest, just don’t like the look of the alien. Too much cgi takes me out of it
I hope the cat survives tbh 🫤
I'm scared for the cat, no 😭😭😭
Dude, I think it's the best movie in the series, and it's nice to use alien soundtrack.
That Stench! It's PICHAI again!!! Pajeet Pichai? I found clean pavement. Väry goodä. Poo in it!
very nice to see them clawfingers are  back....and not just another scam FCK BS trailer....cant wait!
Top filme
War of the Worlds vibe !
The cat 😂😭
Istg if the cat dies I’m gonna cry😭
my favourite movie❤❤
I hope that cat survive 😢
Wow I am so excited
Assistam e muito top ,vão curtir demais
I dont understand the constant necesity of usa to make such garbage, satanic and useless movies every day
When is this movie coming out?
Looks better than the first one
Woke enough, I guess
blind aliens can defeat human army, totally nonsense.
First 2 were amazing
Full movie Download
prop   ag  gan  da   say it with me class, propaganda
The creatures couldn't function properly in the hood with all the ceiling birds.
I knew this day would come. Making a movie that starts from out of nowhere, will have a chance to make a prequel/the beginning of the story
Paramount is officially milking it now.
. . . . . Chris Pratt kinda beat them to it tbh.
Am I the only one who feels like the creepy background music is the same as in Alien: Covenant?
Love☘️
It was amazing and perfect❤
How can they hear anything when they're making so much f***ing noise?
That cat should survive, if not--
Top muito bom recomendo
I can`t wait for this. BTW, the cat is so cute.
I cant waittt!!!
Let's be realistic. If these monsters had arrived on Earth in the Middle Ages, they could have forced the entire population of the planet to live in fear and silence. But in the 21st century, such monsters simply would not be able to defeat modern armies. Well, tell me, how can such monsters destroy even one tank? After all, any armored vehicles, not to mention aircraft, would destroy these monsters without loss. So no matter how much I like all these movies about the end of the world, I understand that in reality, people would have won, and very easily. It is clear that there would be civilian casualties, but modern armies would gradually destroy all aliens.😎
I see that they have forcefully inserted a black actor in a series that was doing well otherwise. Did Netflix have something to do with it?
was this filmed during the BLM riots of 2020? Looks oddly the same...JS
Hope this one doesn’t suck as bad as the second one
😮
I'm so sick of this with films I won't be watching it.
As a cat owner, I know that cat is gonna meow for food and get snatched 😢 I can't bear to watch
Is this "RUSSIAN KNIGHTS" at 1:00?)) Probably an alien invasion is really needed for us to finally accept, that there is only one state - Earth =^_^=
The sounds
Big cinephile here, Liked the first one, have not seen the sequel, however. This prequel looks exciting. I loved alien invasion films since the 50s!
Can theese tie into Cloverfield 😊
😢this is interesting
No animals or insects that made noise would survive this, that’s crazy.   Would the aliens just decimate bees that buzz? lol
ce n'est pas la musique de alien convenant par hasard?!!!
she has a cat 🥹 i would cry if it died
Date is long 😮
Eddie always gets attacked by some outworld monsters.
1:27 Am i tripping or is the noise when the title screen comes up from alien covenant?
Everyone STFU 😂
Yay, diversity!   Our greatest strength!
One fart and your dead... geez
anybody hear alien covenant bgm
You just know this whole movie was made because people online were like "HOW DID A MODERN ARMY LOSE!?"
The cat ❤❤❤
I really hope they make a 4th movie after this one but of humanity fighting back with their new weapon
This one will be better of almost all of them because this one is based on New York giving cloverfiled vibes.
I hope this is a documentary. I wish people, specially my stupid neighobur, would be more quiet or get eaten!
Seeing all those new yorkers walking at 00:54 is haunting it reminds me of 9-11. I wonder if they're quiet in this scene that would make the scene all the more scarier!
its always star from t begun .. so .... when the end of teror ???
These movies had plot holes everywhere which made it impossible to suspend disbelief.
More predictive programming. normies gonna hate when this happens IRL.
Indirectly say dont blow horn
*Cloverfield, I missed you so much.*
Where is Emily blunt and kids and cillian Murphy
This movie "A quiet place" has these alien looking creatures that sort of resemble the so called "fake" aliens at the so called "fake" Miami Mall incident.I'm sure it was a fake incident but some of those "fake" videos people would put out sort of resemble the aliens in this movie 🤔
I just hope that cat is okay
Hopefully, we'll finally see the REAL aliens behind this invasion... i.e. the  actual intelligent ones that built and sent those ships with their attack dogs on them. In other words, the overlords!
I only care about the cat.
yawn
I thought the original film stated that New York never got hit? Either way seeing these aliens attack New York probably the noisiest place on earth is going to be terrifying!
The cat better survive
I hope the cat survives 😭❤️
Diversity and inclusion. 😂
Ill watch anything with lupita. Shes gorgeous..
I WAS soooooooooooooooooooooo hoping for more from this universe! Can't wait! they could do "Day 1" films for SO MANY places experiencing day 1.
Lol black ppl in it?
Theyre really milking this weak franchise for all they can. A movie about aliens who are attracted to noise.  Groundbreaking. Really.
Bumboclaaaaaaa'
Power! 😍
Aren't black people known for being loud and obnoxious? Seems like the aliens would get them first
Has anyone found any decent torrents for this movie yet?
I would love this world. Ok the monsters would be a pain but that quiet would be amazing.
also, won't all that noise confuse the aliens?
For Durability, with armor basically covering their body, the Death Angel's can easily survive explosions from crashing into earth which are compared to nukes. They have even survived explosions from the military which should include explosions worth over 50 megatons of tnt.
what i dont understand is why not just play loud music on the speakers of some open air arena and once all the aliens gather at the stadium, drop a MOAB?
Thomas shelby spoted💥
Kya ye bachcho ki movie hai
did anyone notice alex wolff'scharacter in the trailer? He's breifly in the background
Imagine getting killed coz u farted
If something happens to that cat i swear🤨
The cat looks so cute. like if you think so to❤❤❤😊
Looks tight
Just when I thought that these films couldn't get any better, they went ahead and cast Djimon Hounsou!
are they gonna attack the metal concert or no?
Looks lame with the same feel as any lame monster movie before it.
I’ve been waiting for this next one for sooo long.
Recycling sound effects from Alien Covenant.
Loucura esse filme apocalipse total
This movie going to be better
Congratulations John Krasinski... You did it🎉
i am texting to stay quiet
Hate when they make films which should have been the first one. Now it doesnt make any sense knowing what happens after.
I feel like I've seen this before 😅 but in another time reminds me of I am legend
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!
Political correct! Aggggggggain!😮
Uff is cinema 🚬🗿
I'm in it looks dope
lets gooooo!!!
that cat had better survive the entire movie.
Mark 10:27  $Trying2GetBlessed
Im exited to see this movie. ❤
YESSS I am so excited to see Lupita Nyong'o in another horror film! I love the way she brings her characters to life with such intention and emotion. Day 1 is going to be epic
Music reminds me of Alien: Covenant.
Why are they stealing the alien covenant soundtrack though
Feels like the apts I currently reside in
Um filme muito boommm !!!
Did the cat make it?
Its getting stupider like resident evil. Also they have to stick a certain skin colors otherwise they wont be a politically correct. But it is always big mistake as it value goes down.
Muito bom excelente 🎉🎉🎉
Kind of surprise they're not having a quiet place part three but a prequel instead. definitely excited for it can't wait to watch it
terrible idea, this was one of the biggest suspensions of disbelief you had to take when watching the first movie. how do aliens that hunt strictly by sound find anything in a noisy af city. It would be like trying to hunt while surrounded by massive spotlights all shining in your eyes.
please let the cat survive
p
ok so they are Aliens? how did they get to interstellar travel, there's no goddam sound in space
Clover verse 😬
Bro the herd of them got me like omgosh ready to see this in imax
i keep hearing goofy stock scream sfx in the background lol
I cant wiat😮
I have to see this movie😮😮😮😮
What a blend
I wish the series was in reverse just doesn’t make sense for it to be backwards.
Djimon Honssou
I loved theis movie
is the movie out?
He 2 🎯🤟🏼🔥
Uau !!! Que treiller é esse ? Lupita e  Jhosep , vai ser demais ❤
I love Lupita Nyong’o and this franchise so I’m very excited for this one.
YES PROTECT THE CAT AT ALL COSTS ✊🏻
Woke
Waitingggggggg button ;)
Cat better not get hurt in anyway
🔥🔥🔥 I really can't wait 😂
I hope the kitty is ok
So lyupita you got a new movie congratulations
🤫🤫🥱🥱🥱😴😴
Why MUUST they ruin every movie which they remake trying to include black people,what is weong with black agenda in america,the world is laughin at tou.
Definitely awaited movie.
So excited ! I’ve been  binging on part one and two of this film 🎥
Parece ser bom demais
Finally an answer behind the mystery of the first movie.
When I tell you I am HYPE for this film! Ms. Lupita?? AND Mr. Djimon Hounsou?!? That man know he stay in some roles lol I'll be there. Though I am tired of Hollywood's prequels/sequels/remakes, I would love to see this origin story!
cant waitttttttttt
Waiting !!
I'm excited but I really wanna know what happens after the 2nd movie
"Oh wow I love A Quiet Place, it'll be fun to see another movie in this universe-"  *sees cat in opening*  "Oh nevermind"  I'm not lookin to cry over a pet dying, sorry. 😂
Filme excelente
Everyone Quite.. SHHH 🤫
How tf is this trailer didn't go to my recommended ??
I love this movie series. I hope it will continue every year 🎉 I have never seen such experience before.
The last two was awesome I can’t wait to see this one!!!!
Man what ever happened to clover field
The cat better be the final girl/sole survivor!
Yes please!
Can't wait to see it. Looks awesome.
I wish the cat luck with the monsters
Todays movies go through a list like this; Remake check, Change characters to black ppl check, Throw in some member berries check, go woke and go broke check
Look disturbing
Looks shlt .
Ok but my main concern is if the cat will get through this movie safely 😢
If the cat doesnt survive, im going to kms
they already did day one in the first movie
Sorry, but army can't destroy those aliens that fell from space? Are they invincible? 🤔🤯
replaced white lead actors with black lead actors......are we surprised ?
yep watching
No
I literally had goosebumps watching this 😭😭 I have seen the last two in the cinema and they’ve become one of my favourite franchise of movies. The first one blew me away. Such an amazing concept and such powerful acting by everybody. The scene when the dad give his life to protect his kids gets me every time 😭 then the second one was just as brilliant, there’s just something I find so different from all the other horror type movies I’ve ever seen. I’m so excited to see this 3rd instalment. The trailers are always amazing and then we see the movies and sometimes we’re left a bit deflated BUT so far, the last two movies have absolutely lived up to the hype and excitement of the trailer. This looks no exception and I can not wait to see it. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
FINALLY!
Ooh, I think THAT's why Djimon Hounsou had to decline being in Gladiator 2. Such a shame, I would've loved to see him in it. But I'm so happy to see him in this one. One of my favorite actors, really underrated.
100% We are waiting. From India, TN
Eu duvido que esse gato sobreviva ate o final do filme, por mais que eu queira.
Wowwww
Be quiet
This is going to be scary 😱
Diversity is ruining everything
Cant wait
A quiet place has been by far my favorite set of movies, I have watched the first and second over and over
That Alien soundtrack tho😶
Whisper: So This is a Prequel?
I’m SO excited to see Lupita Nyongo into another horror film she kills it every day
Lupita Nyongo flying out Kenyan 🇰🇪 flag high
wack
I don't know why but there is something so fascinating about new york apocalypse movies
Alien covenant music?
Looks like a pre sequel no one was really asking for.
America is obsessed with its own demise
stop putting lupita in everything bro. let the girl rest.
with the military tech we have, this movie would've been over in just the first day lol.
Awe she has a cat ❤
I just hope they dont "woke" this in to oblivion like everything else
people are dying and my focus on on the cat "Save the kitty!" "Where is the kitty?!" I know my priorities
Y'all put Joseph Quinn's name before Djimon Hounsou? 🥴
This might be the best one...
Hollywood is not done being inclusive, yet. I love Lupita to death, but really, must you have a 'black' version of every movies and tv series??? The thing about producers and directors trying to be politically correct is they risked making viewers feeling phony, like movies aren't fictitious enough already.
NO HABIA PRESUPUESTO PARA OTRA ACTRIZ XD ?
Have to watch in day one😮
Be quiet 🤫 🥰🔥🔥
So many bots lol
7 days later and only now I know a trailer of this movie has been out 💀
Yooooooo😮😮
Cillian murphy 🥰❤❤❤❤
👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I hold my breath while watching this trailer.
NO WAY! I can’t wait for this!
why exactly has this series decided to try becoming an anthology now?
Our two very own african Giants 🎉🎉..
Our very own lupita nyongo❤
0:52 EDDIE MUNSON IN THE FLESH!
Everyone give your life to christ before this becomes a reality. No one knows when judgement day will come PLEASE!!!!!
I don’t know who this black person is, but it looks stupid
Rip to mr fantastic 0:01
They used the Alien Covenenat sound effect in there  Even tho that movie wasnt the best, the music was awesome
I'm so into this movie!!! What an amazing team behind. Love it! Lookin' forward 🤩
affirmative action, ill pass
Cant wait for this movie
I thought we already got day one with thr last movie.
Movie fanatic here! 🎥🤩 🎞️
Será que daria certo se tivesse uma série da continuação do filme 2?
looks very stunning and brave
Meh
Yaaaaay im soo glad Dijimon is back
Big tuna !!!!!
Here for it! A Quiet Place is setting up to be an all time great trilogy. Loved both of the first two movies
The thumbnail look like AI!
There's a cat in this movie. Only saving grace.
I loved the first two... this preview does little for me though.
cant wait
It sucks that we know Lupita eventually ends up dying
scary ? the second film was a waste of screen space with nothing different . Wont bother with this
Spoiler alert:      Its WEF and Claus coming after us.
can’t wait!!!
I'm gonna be worried about the cat the entire movie.
hahahahaha  Just came to here to downvote this DEI nonsense.
Imagine someone died because they farted
Why does everything need to have a version featuring other demographics?!  Enough.
It's looks very interesting can't wait to see how it goes
I was like, oh noo, kids again, then saw that she's like 40 O_o
Um dos melhores filmes que já vi, intenso.
Love this franchise
omfg YES YES YES I NEED TO SEE THIS I LOVE A QUIET PLACE
If anything happens to the cat I stg
this movie makes no sense. total bullshit.
At the and of the trailer 1:27 it's the theme song of Alien Covenant..how is that?😂
This I gotta watch on imax❤🎉🎉🎉
cheap money grab.
One of the biggest movies horror movie of the caliber❤❤
anybody else hear the same kinda music from alien covenant towards the end of
Maravilhoso, ansiosa para assistir❤
Another woke box ticking exercise 😂😂
Esse filme é top super lançamento,  recomendo!
I hope the cat makes it...
Cool
Very excited to see this!!
Meh I'm sure it will be a great watch but I wanna see humanity taking back the planet
For a second I thought this was fan made. I'm so glad its not. I'm in!
Isn't A Quiet Place 2 basically the same movie?
Just like zombie movies it’s always more exciting during the start of it
Lupita is doing white face?  Isn't that against the law or something?
I have never got these films, it always seems to me that the monsters would be easy to beat by simply setting sound distraction systems.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Grande história, personagens bem construídos, não tem como não assistir esse filme mais de uma vez 🎉
Lindoioooiio❤❤❤❤❤
Quero muito olhar nossa ❤❤
Maravilhoso 😍
I AM SO EXCITED!!!!!! AHHHHHHHH!!!!
Cliche Reloaded...
That music note is from Alient:Covenant..............dont tell me they  gonna merge the universes somehow 🙂🙂
Yo!!!!!! My simple response
That cat better make it
Do those monsters have a name?
waiting for it...huge fan of this franchise
Typical gotta replace the white actors with the fugitives.
Такое кино мы будем смотреть
I'm more interested in DAY 1 of EMILY BLUNT's Botched BOTOX adventure . . .
Does anybody noticed that sound on 1:25 sounds almost identical like Jed Kurzel - Incubation (0:39) from Alien Covenant?
the whiteface of black supremacy😂
That noise going WAAA… WAAA! Sounds a lot like the noise in the first Alien movie trailer
darn, another black characters... diversity? but it hurts the eye... sigh, modern movies getting destroyed by nonsensical views of irrelevant...
Mais um lixo segregacionista.
These things would not go to more populated countries like China or India? Just America right? They should have a sequel in China and the protagonist is European and not America and African.
Finally, how it all begins!
Who’s been a Djimon Hounsou fan since Blood diamond and Never Back Down?
Oh there was wayyy more of those "Death Angels" than i thought 💀
Maravilhoso
https://www.youtube.com/@videopark007
my wee wee big
So excited for the sequel but the story is gonna be a prequel and being a fan of a quiet place movie the ticket is sold in advance because i don't wanna miss it. Besides i love Lupita in the horror movies and can't think of others except her.😍😍😍
Woww this is better then before 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is why the gods flooded the earth..  We was too dam loud
Djimon Hounsou AND Lupita Nyong'o????  Oh I'm there!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing stories excited
Another DEI film. Hard pass
I’m actually kinda excited for this
Quit place : part 2 there is somebody bring the alien into the island. There must be somebody want people to died.. Somebody that feel lonely or crazy
Nakia and Johnny Storm
Djimon and Lupita? I would watch just for them if I didnt already enjoy the story
This is the third quiet place movie
They are back Who I mean they are here to destroy the world and they have been coming and going all these years only in america ..why??
AI generated ahhh cover💀💀💀💀💀💀
boring af.
I’m scared to watch it, too worried about the kitty 🐱❤
I'm really hoping that cat has plot armor
Goosebumps trailer 😮
Nice❤
It's gonna be a masterpiece 🫶
1:16 Holy CRAP... that's a lot
Americans in every Movie -"Lets Save America"
Eita vai ser do caralho
Soundtrack is a total rip-off of the alien theme from Alien: Covenant
I'm glad they're making this because I've always wondered how a bunch of naked alien idiots who can't hear you if you're next to a waterfall or whatever and can be killed with feedback and a shotgun managed to conquer the entire planet lol
No fence John but this is a big glow up from the office.
Hollywood trying to show all the black people
Woke
Will watch and love the series of this movie But just the biggest downfall is that they seem to be everywhere like really everywhere the world is so big that they really can’t be everywhere
Waiting ❤
This looks intensed. I wanna see this.
Make it happen in real life. This would be awesome!
Nice i love these kind of movies
😮😮😮
Idiotic, stupid and retarded concept for a story.  So they're blind and attack based on sound.  And WE, the human civilization, have NO response to this?  Not sonic weapons, heat seeking munitions, air cover?  Seriously, can the creatures fly?  I mean, I can see carnage upon first arrival, in urban areas, but here in the rural south we'd be hunting those things for sport.  And how did they get here anyway?  They're so primitive that they just run around killing anything that makes a sound, yet sophisticated enough for interstellar travel?  Really?  And of course, they instantly adapt to our biosphere, with total resistance to viruses and bacteria.  I got talked into watching the 1st movie with a friend and it was a complete waste of 2 hours of my life.  You have to be pretty dense to waste any time on this drivel.
Lame and unoriginal
Pass
Wah cilian murphy main disini wkwk
VS depleted uranium sabot rounds? Lol
welcome back
Oh look...a black version of A quiet place. Not for me.
Finally, a movie with a black woman.
mandatory black person in every movie nowdays
What is someone fart ? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Finally 🔥 my favorite movie franchise next one🔥🤍
This movie is so bad, who wrote this, and why is this keep going for a 3th time 😂 😂
What if something fart ?
The cinematography goes crazy! Kudos to the DP and director!
O gato vai morrer.... 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
most epic horror movie
Filme será ótimo
hi
Djimon deserved better in the last movie. I hate that he’s back and we know he gets a lame death later on
So it is a prequel?
Hollywood has no new topics for their movies. Everything is scifi, Future attacks etc
Lets go 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Man those comment farms out of India really putting up numbers.
In an extended trailer, you see Joe Biden addressing the nation in a secure location saying "I did this."
This is old fvcking video
If there was an alien invasion, and you saw somebody go and hide under a car, would you grab their ankles and say "Please. Please."? I presume she's a stranger.   That part made no sense to me.
FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 THIS NEEDS TO BE OUT Immediately
Wow.... finally 🔥
Part 1 and 2 very boring. Only fake Action.
dead alive ؟
The alien planet got destroyed and took the space rock to earth
I guess people would pee on the commode walls in this muvie to keep things silent
Thank you for including bald black woman, I wasn't gonna watch it otherwise
Cool
Im gonna get so high with this movie
the best of Deadpool 3 short  video this channel  https://youtu.be/cy7MBaPb-oM?si=QWuYMIycrnF-wBmo
They literally showed Day One in the second movie 😂 This is definitely a cash grab (especially with them casting a horrible actress as the main character)
#JUSTICEFORTHECAT
She must call Army of Wakanda and fight with them....Because its Thanos's grand child this time 😂😂
Terrible casting
Très bonne saga horrifique! Le 1 a mis une claque à tout le monde.
I'm really not interested in the backstory or "how" TQP happened. It doesn't feel tense or scary at all from this trailer... Like seeing a bunch of meteorites land in broad daylight and a bunch of monsters... what made TQP scary was the slow pace. No big action carnage scenes. Eh
My only gripe with this movie is you are telling me all of the brightest minds in the world, all the militaries, nobody thought that maybe the creatures that are hypersensitive to hearing. . . . might just o I dunno, be super weak to loud noises? It took a deaf girl and stroke of luck to save the planet from thinking of the most basic idea?  Just seems like something we would have dealt with pretty early on with no chance of extinction.
It’s scary because it is set in one of the worlds most noisiest city.
Nice movies ❤ i follow from pt 1 and pt 2
Who is the cat and does she survive??!
looks like a very generic hollywood movie, but imma give it a shot once it’ll be available for free on torrents
Just the thought of a horde stampeding on an entire cityscape. The filmmakers give you only silhouetted images through dusted up windows. So the audience’s imagination of all that carnage is chilling enough.
LOVE IT
I wish I could scream in the comments cause I am screaming yes yes yes I am ready for this
Let me guess. The aliens represent the white man? Hollywood woke garbage 🤮
I dont know if i can watch this without jim from the office making funny faces at the camera
😮😮
we WILL be there. no matter what.
0:58 Кологривый красава, до Америки добрался
Why the black egg heads castings?
The suspense music is basically Alien Covenant 😂
Right on time with the fake alien invasion impending. Should be entertaining none the less.
Aju majuj
So many AI generated comments lol
When will it be released
kind of bored this repeated subject
Can we get a fourth movie after this one? 🥺
I can’t wait to watch this movie glad they putting focus on different people perspective of the outbreak this gonna be scary and exciting.
Once that title showed at the end, I swear they used the whistle audio from Aliens Covenant.
If a person wants to fart then his death is certain.
rip cat
THAT CAT BETTER SURVIVE
Waiting for this thrilling movie again
We should be quit to restore peace
Seems like the W.E.F is preparing you for round 2.
Now, this is a classic
i thought i already watched this without lupita in it
If anything happens to that cat....
This is something to see in future 😉😀
Exactly  what the people wanted to see action somewhere loud where its impossible to be quiet thank you
This movie forces you to meditate
So its hide and go seek.  Pshhh easy game
Excited
Matlb ye part. 3 hai

“We’re Hollywood producers; we’ll take an innovative and original idea and milk it until everyone is bored of it!”
uniq story reverse story
Is this from Alien Covenant 1:26
That cgi is hot stinky garbage
Don’t care at all about the humans in this, just ensure the cat is safe 🤞🤞🤞
Lol
I remember saying that I was very excited to see what Joseph Quinn was going to be doing with his Stranger Things fame when season 4 came out and I'm delighted to see him in something like this. I'll definitely watch for him but having Lupita Nyong'o as the lead is exciting as well
Слепые так быстро не могут передвигаться, разве что м моменте. Конечно это хорошая фантастика, но всё же.
Nah, no need for this. Not every movie needs to be turned into a franchise. So whats this gonna be, the quiet-verse? Lol Next is “Quiet Place:10 years of Silence”then its  “ A Quiet World” where you see the planet where the monsters are from. Then its “Quiet Place: The Final Sound” followed by “Quiet Place: Max Volume”
Today is the day of salvation! Accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior before it's too late!  John 14:6  Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
Apakah ini akan menjadi film prekuelnya Quiet Place?
A prequel before the series is ended? This is out of order.
missing Emily blunt 😢😢
where is the cat?
This feels like a cinematic experience. Definitely one you see AT the theater
The second one was terrible lol
This is going to start feeling bloated and will definitely get worse with each sequel. It happens everytime. 😮‍💨
That kitty better be okay or I’m not gonna be
IF THE CAT DIES IM SUING THEM
Bear traps and razor wire set up everywhere. Movie over.
In the second movie of "A Quiet Place"; the start showed supposedy how it happened when John Krasinski was still alive (Day 1)... This was during the baseball seen when everyone looked up and saw the creatures coming to Earth in the sky
Jim was at his desk in the office writing bangers !
Black Bolt : 😮🫨🤫 💨
Did they really use that one sound effect from alien covenant?
0:45 Is it me, or does that scream sound similar? It sounds like either Sniper or Soldier from TF2.
This film is so unbelievable, I mean a quiet black woman give me a break. 🙂
The music in this trailer: 🥁🥁😱
Is it just me or did these guys steal a sound effect from Alien Covenant?
really love to see how the military dealt with this. Hopefully not some dumb crap like the walking dead
Hmmmm... a remaking of a 2018 movie.    Then there's "The Fall Guy," and "Road House."  The film industry have gone into the retread business.
6 days ago 😮
Smart move these two actors r going to take this movie 🎬 to a different level.
Wow, 1:21, look at the size of those nostrils!!!! One could fist them!
I don’t like a queen place one day
Show de bola
Laaa malah prequel😮😮😮
The sound at 1:26 is the exact same sound of some scenes in Alien Covenant
Why all the downvotes? Lemme guess...same folks calling everything "woke." How lame. film looks awesome btw.
They got the money uh
Anybody else worried about her dog?!
1:27 mark - is it just me or is that eerie sound not from what we heard in Alien Covenant? Or was that connection already made and I missed it?
Can’t wait to see it
This is going to be the biggest summer BLOCKBUSTER
Oh boy I love making everything a  franchise and being spoon fed lore so it is not scary anymore. I love taking away the ambiguity of the original film to gain profit.
why monkey?
Im hoping the writing would be better than the second movie.
I'm so ready for this. I loved the 1st, the 2nd was ok and this one looks more exciting.
Hopefully this lives up to the first movie.... the 2nd one was so disappointing
Really trying to squeeze everything out of this franchise, lol.   I hear A Quiet Place, day 1,000, is in the works.
Yes I’m excited this looks truly amazing
I’m gonna love this movie this is what I wanted to see since the first movie
Ready!!!
I like how movies like this creates a real life effect in the theator where everyone is quiet 😂. Not even eating popcorn or drinking a soda . Cant wait to experiece this again lol
The first two were bangers and I absolutely plan on seeing this one, too! The Quiet Place and Don't Breathe franchises are two of my favorite suspense/thriller franchises to have come out in modern times!
I have watched this movie before must be some remake or something
These aliens sure do make a lot of noise for being creatures that seem to prefer silence. Attacking anything that makes a sound. Reminds me of that bear from the MGM cartoon "QUIET!!! SHUT UP!!! AH TOLD YA, AH HATE NOISE!!!!!"
Not another one...
Imagine how quiet it’s going to be inside how bad people are gonna be chewing the popcorn
Best movie ever
Mid
Im down for this
june is packeddddd
its back i wasnt expecting that but its back!
You better not touch that cat!
I need to know that that cat makes it through the whole movie
Yes yes yes I'm here for it I'm so glad they're going to show us what happened 🤓
do snore noise is not counted ?
Thiiiis looooks fuggennnnnn SIIIIIIIICK YESSSSS
Have been waiting for this kind of movie for so long...... Finally it's here😍😍😍
Aliens are welcome in NY Sanctuary City😂
If they did a sequel I’m betting it’s going to be called “A Quiet Place: Day Two”
YO WE’RE GOING TO GET THE BACKSTORY FOR THE ISLAND HAVEN TOO?! YES
I just realised that everyone who snores was dead within 48 hours.
Glad to see Russian Warriors Aerobatic team in this trailer https://youtu.be/YPY7J-flzE8?si=nQ1I_1G6G-xFIomn&t=60
I can already feel the cat dying in this movie 😢🥺. Not watching that.
There is a cat i hope the cat is okay, i hope the cat survives
Am so excited to watch this
no need to watch this movie, this is real life in Sudan, Palestine. Silence is complicity, end the suffering, end the occupation
Trailer de um filme muito bom, já assisti e aconselho
this is exactly what ppl need recently...
This is so cool.
somehing smels here...
Снова негры:( фильм не зайдёт.
Quiet a black woman is speaking. They dead in 2 minutes, this should be a short film lol
Skinwalkers do actually exist...I've see them...very similar creatures.
Hopefully it’s better than the garbage second movir
This is such a bad franchise,, why is being still made
Rip we know the fate of honsou's character t
Will black people in the theater be quiet 🫤?
Pff, ya la quier0 ver. 13/2/23
Would love to see a military prospective of the invasion
No thanks
Unless they are going to show something new about the aliens I’m not bothered. It’s just going to be the same old thing for the third time.
No way! They got Jay Z and Ice Spice to be in the movie?
Lupita ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please  Stop making prequels.
1:27 isn’t that the music from Alien: Covenant??🤨
exactly what we needed
okay...I'm going to watch it backwards...
Why blacks?
Great stuff, keep it up.
The fact that this takes place in New York City and everyone there is going to be forced to be quiet is gonna be the scariest part.
Sorry but not sorry i only care about the cat
No not a cat!
Would have been better if the aliens were found on the earth or created by humans anyhow, instead of just falling from the sky in spaceships. I mean, they had the brains to create spaceships and travel other worlds but still behaved like wild animals and couldn’t even communicate in any way?
nooo...cat...
1:06 - war of the worlds vibes
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
How can such a boring mundane movie have so many sequels?
Sam Niell: "Don't move a muscle John". John Krasinski: "Ssshhhh!"
😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Now this looks better than the second bird box movie
Lets go
They changed horror thrilling movie to Sci-fi Movie. What a shame !
So excited to see this movie! The Quiet Place keeps getting better each movie. These stars are great in it too.
Hmm a "summer" movie in June...
I just cant wait
Must see!! 😊
Why our world went quiet?  Um...cuz if America???
i hope nothing bad happens to the cat, I don´t want to cry
Excellent Traler 👏👌
Trash!
thats one resiliant cat 😅looks like it made it thru at least half the movie
🔥
If the cat dies, we riot.
Next part day two
Dijimon hounsou being in this again I bet the woman seen in this is his kids mom
Hopefully they didn't let DEI and "the narrative" get in the way of the story. The First Purge had so much potential, and they ruined it.
I expect nothing, just generic action whooley-booley with diverse characters. They should have left the first one alone. As usual, it will only go downhill from there. May I add that since the Inception teaser trailer every trailer for action-leaning movies are similar. Makes that trailer from 2009 one of the best for all time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlrQvE-OhD4
You showed me that cat like 3 times. It better live.
sigh, another braindead generic movie for the dumbed down audiences  Idiocracy , Year (?)
Ok 👌🏼
Mass bgm ❤
Eerie
Mükemmel bir film izleminizi tavsiye ediyorum 🎉🎉❤
That cat better have plot armor I swear
Whats with the forced diversity? I noticed only white people are being shown getting killed
Joseph Quinn??? I’m in!!
where's NASA?
1:00 showing Su-27/30/35. Showing other nations as well?
Too Interesting... Eagerly Waiting 🔥
This is going to be 🔥 blast
Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?
Shout out to my day 1’s
The most far-fetched thing in this movie is 2 black people not talking for hours and hours on end.
THIS IS GONNA BE FIRE BRO🔥
Ouuuuuuuuuuuuu👀‼️🫡
Jesus Christ this trailer is fireeee 😮😮 and I can't wait to watch this in theatre
Need it in a series form😭😭
This trailer seems to be heavily inspired by the original Alien trailer. Nice inspiration.
That cat better survive.
Laughable how these “monsters” weren’t vaporized by the military in days. I’d like to see how they stand up against heavy caliber bullets, missiles and tactical nukes lol 😂
A Quiet Place Af: John Krasinski, Emily Blunt Engels
this takes place in America so why is there su-27 fighter jets
that cat better turn out ok
Disney😂?
I still remeber that day when I watched the movie without sound for half an hour just to realise that volume was not turned on
This film will make your mental disorder.  Don't watch it
Why 😂 the first one sucked, why are they trying to push this movie.
Flop
Don,t make noise
Love from India 😍 Waiting 💥😲
This is gonna be great! (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠)
Boring. Wringing every last dollar out of this idea. The first film was original and superbly directed/acted. The second was meh. This looks like they just sold off the rights, and we're going to take a further dip in quality. Skipping this unless I hear it's worth it.
#cillianmurphy ??? What he's in it too?
I don’t even need sound to know this film is 10/10
Abandonaste al gato ctm? Me caiste mal desde ya
better than dune ever will be
I'm sorry... but all i wanna see now is if that cat survives...
Excited to know what happened on day 1 in a big city but man am I dreading what happens to that cat
a quiet place 2 was bad i'm skipping this one
That cat better survive
Que doideira, vai ser top esse filme!!!
Hello nerds! Did you enjoy watching this trailer today? 😊
Waiting for this
I feel like we have seen this movie more than a few times already... Next
Watching it just cz of lupita the other ones were rubbish
In the start i guess this will be 28 months later ... Lal but its not....😢
As long as that cat lives i dont care about anyone else
Bro u think that's a joke !! That will happen someday u have to belive Allah before everything u making laugh about it will be true , u think we're here in this life to play no no think
Ótimo filme da Paramount
Uma ótima produção
Scarier than any horror movies
So just remark it by adding a black person as main character.   What a joke
Another achievement for black community or black american to participate in lead role movie congratulations 🎉🎊 so excited for this coming movie 🍿
Okay, it's 2024 so it has to be black main character :D
Yeah I aint watching if the cat dies. xD
I don’t like djmon honsus death in 2 he seemed so called and collected while driving away from the monster and hiding his kid in the closet then they get to the station and he has a full on panic attack out of no where starts like yelling
No Emily Blunt?
Here I thought that Americans were normalizing their future 😂
a diverse Quiet place
This is absolutely 🔥🔥🔥 Hope ro see the origins of the Monsters
FINALLY
can't wait...
Definitely gonna check this out!!!
is that murphy at 15 sec of the trailer ??
The cat 😩😩
here we go
Here for it
We can't escape this "End of The World", We get it already. If it aint movies, its music videosand if it aint that it video games. Dark times we live in.
I wish theres some military action like helicopters and jet fighters engaging
Love Djimon Hounsou, this looks boss can’t wait to watch it
Still don’t understand how these monsters took over everything. Same problem with zombie movies. Governments all over would just nuke anywhere too far gone in a heartbeat.
This has the potential to make people fall for it
I hope the cat can survive 😂
I am watching this solely based on the cat
this is next level
Another cash grab
The same poc actors they put in everything. BIG SUPRESA
The cat better survive. 😭
It's 3 am and I can't sleep because of this awful cough that's put out my rib and gives me migraines. I would have lasted all of three minutes. At least I'd finally get a decent night's rest.
this is where the quite kids, got their last laughs (silently).
I'm waiting
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
This so can be a cloverfield cross over.
O m g I m so excited to watch this ❤
5 out of 5 librarians recommend
I really love this movie....i do
When is It going to be released?
NYC is the worst place to be during an invasion the only time I’ve seen it quiet was during the pandemic, other than that it’s always crowded and loud.
Waiting for this the whole time
Am EXCITED!!!!!
This will be VERY SCARY!!!!
They used the prometheus soundtrack ! Nice detail
eggzoiiiiting!!!! 😍
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great a movie they don't have to member their lines.
I’m DEFINITELY seeing this movie
This is going to be absolutely positively insane
I really enjoyed quiet place 1 and 2 so excited for a new film!
unnecessary prequel 👎
🤫
The tyranids are here!
Quiet place for Blacks mtfr😂
Looks bangin
MAn this G-day MOvies ...🤩🤩🤩 can't wait till june...........
This is even better than the sequels
.
aliens nowadays have nice acting skills, congrats
I'm excited to see Lupita Nyongo
That’s the year
I love Djimon Hounsou. he's a great actor and needs to be in more stuff as a main.
clover field
Woke
Librarians when someone breathes
Really powerful movie..... No one campare with Quiet places
Why aliens only attack Americans? 😅
another black female lead?? go woke go broke.
just go to the beach / waterfall
My favorite part of any apocalypse movie is the start.
Alf and it friends def will be back after almost 40 years, this time a kind of bit angry because of bad and boring movies.
They're really trying to milk this franchise huh?
props to the lady for carrying her cat even though theyre being chased
Wow
Wow
It's been years i just watched this quiet place 3
Ok, yeah, I'm going to see this.
Reminds me of Independence Day movie.
If they can hear a pin drop two miles away why can't they hear their heartbeats?
1:27 music from Alien:Covenant
Casting Lupita in a movie like Quiet Place is a big thumbs up, man she can act with her eyes and expressions. Anyone that have seen ‘Us’ can concur
Shocker a female back lead… 100% chance she’s. Lesbian as well…
"Discover why hollywood went black"
Sick can't wait!! 🔥
I thought that was Lupita but wasn’t sure. I love this franchise.
You just had to add the token animal to pull at our heart strings. Definitely not watching this just to know the cat will be killed for meowing or some bs.
I hope John and Emily show up in a cameo at the very least.
ah, finally the first contact.
I love this, they actually take the quiet place universe, and then do things you always wondered about, and explore other areas. I’ve always wondered what happened to the cities
I truly love origin movies when it tells the details.  Not just throwing you into the movie.
Only one i got in mind which couldn't make its way, Cloverfield
Booooooooo
adding a cat a messed up but best part
This looks fire
What! Im excited to watch..
ran out of ideas so they keep remaking planet of the apes.
of course it has to be a black woman
The name of the song please?
Can t wait!!!
I hope cat lives. Not sure to wqtch it 😅😅
The dude from Gladiator. I’m in.
Can't wait
I guess this is comparable to when Aliens came out.
What will be crazier is will gonna see cameo of Emily, John and fam running too..woah!!!
She coughs twice and the monsters show up making 1000x more sound, which would then draw every monster in a 100 mile radius, which would just exponentially create more and more sound until...
Wow 😯 bruv thrill to the next level ❤❤
So going to watch this..
So they woked this too.
Alien covenant sound in the final part
That's a Highlight in 2024..the j*ws are comin
cant wait for the Nerd Explains video lol
Yeah,  lets use part 1 and 2 main characters in the trailer so more people go see it….. Classic marketing move when they know they movie will tank hard.
who's here for the cat? 😻🖐
i’m actually really excited for this
I’m Looking forward to this movie
Glad to see Buck Breaking is getting a sequel
What a dystopia for snorers
Broo they need to make this movie in every big city in different perspectives of life would be so dope!!!
Can't wait!
a must see.....
Certified BS
I wonder how long the aliens are going to stay.... Human civilization went totally kaputt in one day, and survivors have a hard time to loot the stores or grow their own food in rural areas without making SOUNDS.... They will probably leave once the last life on Earth has been eaten. Unless in a soundproof underground lab an effective weapon can be developed.  In War Of The Worlds it was 'simply' a matter of sitting the invasion out-- THEIR  aliens were not able to survive our bacteria...  So yes, 'A Quiet Place' is a devilish concept! It absolutely takes alien invasions to a higher level. 🤫
Trash
Bruh the short screams that turn into one long scream while showing clips of the movie make the trailer intense
I'm almost certain this is going to make no sense.
Life after the rapture
A Quiet Place: DEI Edition
Cant wait to see the military fighting these things!!!!
Pointless and vague trailers.
I was waiting for this movie
Nahhhhh they went crazyyy with this one🔥🔥🔥
Haha stupid
Sandra bullock already did this movie. Bird box or whatever.
A Quiet Place in June and Deadpool 3 in July. It’s going to be a fun summer, I am ready!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG4UevZGD_U

cloverfield in any different angle
Looks awesome!
Now imagine how the people of Gaza feel?  😪
1:26 what is the Alien Covenant soundtrack doing here?
Day one✌
????????????
A Quiet Place: DEI
when jim gets extra budget from michael
1:00 why are there Russian SU-27s??
I hope the cat is ok😢
👌
Alien invasion
another apocalypse movie nice
Objective: Save the Cat
Now this, has my interest
That cat better stay alive the entire movie.
Seeing Lupia Nyong'o in this movie is the best idea!!!!!!😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Can not wait!
Of course they needed to go with a black lead...lol
Lupita now part of the franchise turns this from a day one to an hour one for me
The fallen angels wow
Yeah Djimon won’t be dying in this movie…
The screaming gives me chills
I simply cannot wait! It can’t get here fast enough!
Need to watch this! Can't wait
So this is gonna connect to part 2. Saw Djimon in the trailer
How many more of these movies are going to be made? Next will be day one and a half and it'll be a different perspective of either the aliens or Asians POV
1:06 Caucasian person does "blackface" = racially insensitive  African actress does  "whiteface" = totally fine
The second one wasn't all that great. I hope this one is better
Lupita???? most definitely watching
The second movie was disappointing, hopefully this is better.
I’m going to see it because of the cat
SILENCE IS GOLD...  BE QUIET…  REMEMBER…
AAAAA EXCITED
If the cat dies I will be beyond furious.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
how does the human race not figure out sound hurts it?
That cat better have made it
Meh
Yup. I'm sold!
The monsters are scary but they have a lot of holes in their biology and origin
If that cat dies im walking out...
If the aliens crashed all over the world (or just the americas) imagine the ones that landed in the ocean
Cade o gato? Sobreviveu??
Any students ? ❤❤❤
A woke place
Looks nice but idk if I can watch it if the cat doesn’t survive lol. That cat better be ok. I just cannot handle pets be hurt in movies.
Looks promising 🎉🎉…
Perfect
🎉🎉🎉❤🎉🎉🎉
Love this type of movies...
kittyy!
I swear if the cat gets hurt 🥺 I’ll prolly not watch. My heart couldn’t take it
Prequals can quite suck but I think anyone who's enjoyed the other 2 wants to see how it started, and in a heaving city. I'm in.
what an idea. first they create something which is not contemporary. 2 parts. now they are with contemporary one. Day one. Kudos. great strategy. This franchise is ground shaking.
Perfect, it annihilated woke🤣
My favourite movie......😊
Dude grabbed her leg under the car like how is she supposed to help???
all i care about is the cat.
🌸 gosh they keep creating movies where you can’t look, breathe, speak…..what’s next don’t fart 💨  Mind you trailer looks cool, will watch it 😅
Having a 5 week old baby feels like I am in this movie. We dont make a sound when the baby finally falls asleep or it will wake up and find us
Wow this new movie is amazing and awesome 😅🎉😂❤....
Hate to say it, but u don’t think that cat is making it to the end of the movie
I'm IMPATIENT! SO IMPATIENT!
Me and my mom love this series of the quiet place (I’m 14) and the month of June is in my birthday 🎂 so this will be a great birthday this year
Yeah skipping this one. Waiting on the actual sequel.
https://youtu.be/N6zhVZFjQWQ?si=z1QLLiOxUlJk0rET
Tom Cruze in this too? I seen someone running.
Movie seems like it’s not doing anything doing the same thing like the the nun movies and the conjuring 😊
You have my attention 😮
Paramount really milking this franchise dry
Maybe that's why they put all the migrants there.
a
Looks extremely boring,will be full of woke actors with a non exsistent plot,the people hyping this up probably paid to do so😂
I hope nothing happens to that cat 🐈 😭🥲🥲
I think this movie is already released Isn't it? Or am I wrong, anyone?
Mind blowing movie
I'm really afraid when Hollywood turn success into franchise .... that end in very generic blockbuster that never capture the simplicity of the beginning.
ISTG IF THE CAT DIES
Only care what happened to the cat and if cat dies i aint watching this money grabbing film
Jesus Christ make 40 more “quiet places” while you’re at it ffs. Entertainment is completely dead.
Not really sure how this could be any different.  Angry, sound-sensitive aliens hunt noisy humans - Part III.
Part 1 and 2 were awesome and this one looks even better!  Can't wait to see it! ... J
Has alien vibes covenant vibes
They should just call it black quiet place
take my tickets
so happy of seen this becoming a growing franchise!
Will it be shown in cinema?!!!!🏃🏻‍♀🏃🏻‍♀🏃🏻‍♀💨
It's giving I'm Legend
If the cat dies I'll cry
Mmmmm idk. I thought one of the best things about the original movie — and even the sequel — was that you don’t get to see much of the aliens. The tension is so much greater because it’s an almost unknown enemy. This one might lose that uniqueness if they show them a lot. It’ll become just another alien invasion movie. And originally, that’s what set _A Quiet Place_ apart. That’s why I liked it. That’s what I’m worried about.
*A Quiet Place primary monster attribute = "Extinction" monster's blindness and heightened hearing on steroids!*
The bird box is already a lit one so THIS MUST ALSO BE ONe
The end of sleep away camp the look she has with that noise looking to the right and the way her mouth is open scared the crap out of me the only movie I have ever jumped up and turned on every light in the house and couldn't sleep from and I was a teenager then
“Day one” the “divers and inclusive” version..
No.
Por favor no lastimen al gatito
Clearly the cat didn’t survive 😑😭 I’m looking forward to seeing what happened in the beginning. I love stuff like that. It’s like for years I wanted to know how The Walking Dead became the walking dead, it’s fascinating that stuff
Now THAT was a perfect trailer
Those who have seen real war live will laugh at this film, not fear it. It is too primitive and consists only of stamps. Although the picture is beautiful. But watching a movie just for the sake of the picture — who needs that? Greetings from Ukraine.
The one thing I feel like this series doesn't take into consideration is that dead people have a harder time being silent, ironically enough. Cus they won't know that sometimes the things they do actually make noise
It would've been really cool if the Quiet Place franchise was linked to the Primeval series. It would've made sense of where the creatures came from. Future predators.
Esse filme vai ser incrível. 🎉
Of course they have to force black and women. That is why this one will fail
kya baat hai yar super ❤❤
I hope they explain how a bunch of non-technic aliens managed to destroy everything. Cause that never made sense to me in the original movie
❤❤❤
I'm proud of John Krasinsky like I'm his mother
Hope they paid her right cause she’s going to make this movie unforgettable
Yorum
The movie about the aliens instead of the people.
Going to milk this movie for all its worth and then some 😅
Ótimo filme
I wonder how many people died in the movie because they accidentally farted….they thought it’s gonna be the quiet one but it wasn’t… 😂
anything they in im in!!
Looooved the first two ones! Excited for this!
The scream at the background gives the trailer a 100 score
The next big thing:  aliens appear from nowhere and attack anyone who has body odor, so the survivors have to shower every hour or else.
Yes for Lupita! Yes for this this sequel!
Who else noticed the Russian Knights at 1:00 ? 👀
The Director is so smart if I were him, I would do a movie before or how to aliens came to earth
Bu herifler işi biliyor 👍
The first two were great. But this one seems like a different type of movie. More of an action thriller horror. But ill def be checking it out.
Having Lupita Nyong'o and Djimon Hansou together is the selling point for me. If not for them, I wouldn't consider seeing this movie, but now I will.
Güzel film
Ansioso demais para essa obra. Sem dúvida um dos melhores terror do ano.
Video güzelmiş
Video güzelmiş
That cat needs to survive
This actually looks pretty bad. Seems like a bunch of really cheesy effects and gimmicks seen a hundred times.. more of a conventional monster flick than the first two.
Stupid raised to the third power.
Should have just made part 3
Djimon!!!
This looks interestingand now I think I should go watch the other movies for the first time.
Muito bom!
Excelente filme 🎥 😮
O kadar agırlığın altında paspas olmak...
Oh cool didn’t know Djimon character was in this
Oh cool didn’t know Djimon character was in this
Title : War of the worlds 2
this looks better than twisters i rather see this
I can’t wait to see this
Ah yes, the origin of the quiet place
What a movie..it was.
Güzel bir filme benziyor
Otra vez esta payasada?
Finally a monster movie came to NYC ever since 2008 cloverfield this is gonna be epiccccc!!!!
Super excited for this one. Also hoping it's the last of it so they don't run the series into the ground.
Anyone else gonna show this to their children and tell them it's real?
Um dos filmes mais tops que eu quero ver ❤
Similar movie i saw, can't remember the name, the aliens were energies and at last Soviets save them!
Loved Lupita in US. Can't wait to see this ❤❤❤
Wow I can’t wait 👏👏👏👏👏👏🔥
I think there was a big one in some of the other footage 😮
very nice
But I remember in the first one, there were news articles detailing that they were attracted to sound.   From what I see, HOW TF did ANYONE have time to type print and distribute such a thing IN SILENCE! 😂  Can’t wait to see the movie though…
They need to stop already.
Jumpscares are gonna be F ing crazy
This is exactly what I wanted when the first movie came out. Just different stories in the same universe! Can't wait!
"28 days later" again cillian murphy again days
I tell you who refuses to age, Djimon Hounsou refuses to age.
why aliens and monsters only visit the USA?
Typical zergling rush on terrain bases
Why come from space? Makes more sense to come deep from the earth as they apparently hunt by sound
Filme incrível
I hope they show military involved this time and how they get defeated
13% of the population 100% of representation in everything
Muhteşem bir film
Whole cinematic universe he has created! And he keeps expanding it! Love it
FIREEEEEE
Amazing
Filme ótimo
this movie gonna break the Hollywood
Nice
now this is what I wanted. apocalipyic movies are almost always better than post-apocaliptic ones.
Ansioso pelo lançamento 🤩
BOOM
Smokers 🚬 won't survive in.....😂😂‼️
Muito bom e bem elaborado!! 👍
İzlenmeye değer bir film .
Idc about human beings. Just tell me the cat will be safe . 😢
Excited❤
Top❤
Encore Un énième film d'invasion extra terrestre où ils sont encore et toujours méchants pour faire peur aux gens 🤦‍♀️
This was made so they could add a black person to the cast..
The worlds militaries would not lose to these things. However, I am willing to suspend disbelief because I love science fiction and invasion movies
Muhteşem bir flim 😊
Muhteşem
Cannot wait for this - looks like a different vibe to the first two - more of a blockbuster feel to it.  And thankfully that cat is still with her - so hope it survives.
dont be woke,dont be woke,dont be woke,dont be woke,dont be woke,dont be woke,dont be woke.....
yes please
Ооооо, уверен, фильм будет четкий!
Nice
funny that they used the score from Prometheus in the end
Day One is a cool idea and an excuse to make it a more action filled film with the chaos of large crowds.
Now we know, where they came from. 😮
Uhmazing!
Using sounds from the original Alien trailer AND Prometheus?
Love it love it
So basically The Darkest Hour... but in NY?
Это шо, про Украину?
beyond excellent
Looks like the the first part of the second movie and Cloverfield.
C'mon, do we really need a this. Generic is a compliment.
Love this series Cant wait!!
A movie about day one is redundant
Can't wait to see this movie... 😊
it is going to be a masterpiece series
Woke version! No thanks !
I'm there. 😮😮😮😮
This looks INCREDIBLE
Süper film
Lupita said the movie is more a drama than horror/Sci fi......don't believe the trailer because the actual movie could be garbage considering what's been coming out of Hollywood.
Common sense???? 😂😂😂😂
why? we just for the diversity and a bigger budget? come on...
Is the cat ok?
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEe5VM435A_LCcMgieYmCo0hXhDomUpyi&si=6AvsBrruC-u_68vA
Can we have some white people in films.
1:01 .. can anyone at Paramount explain how or why the Russian Knights Aerobatic Display Team make a bizarre random appearance in this trailer completely out of context to the movies storyline 🤷🏼‍♂️ ….. very, VERY lazy research by Paramount’s trailer team 😡
1:25 Did they just used a score of Alien Covenant - Spores?!
Wowwww
Save cat ❤❤
They could actually do so many Quiet place sequels now I think of it. All from different family perspectives at different times 👏
Im so excited ❤️‍🔥
Nope
Funny, that in an age of research and scientific excellence only a family could find the Achilles heel of the alien (specific sound frequency) and not the great scientists of the world.  It took more that an year to find it....  Surely keep your brain/ logical mind at home and enjoy the film.
Why do I feel like I've seen this movie 150 times already?
It looks like a beautiful and scary movie
The cat will give away thier position at least once 😂
No vampires?
REPENT JESUS IS COMING SOON
Nope can’t watch it now I’m too scared abt the kitty, someone protect the kitty from the aliens!!! 😢
smart move to include the cat.... i'm watching
I love this franchise but they should not have used Alien Covenant soundtracks for this trailer.
Ist the guy at the end who tells lupta to shh the guy at the end of the sequel who dies
The episodic style and nested stories each of the previous two movies incorporated was simply mind blowing of a concept to incorporate with such an awesome narrative and plot. This is going to be fabulous~ 🤩🤩
John Krasinski make some moonneeyyyyy
Wow
Another stupid apocalyptic alien invasion movie,aliens don't tap dance like last time, this time they are into jazz
Love anything with Lupita I’m so excited for this
Best news of 2024! Can't wait.
Absolutely love this franchise but F me this add is almost making me bail 🤬
This is a remake
Stupid movies as STUPID can go.
Spookey
Who else remembers that crow in the train 😢😢😢😢
we need more monsters less re-occuring character who has died yawn
That cat better live…
❤❤
Before dreams comes True..... Wating
Dumbest franchise in a long time and boy, are they gonna milk it dry. 🤣
This looks great.   Now if only they did a 28 Minutes Later and other “start of the apocalypse” movies
Non-diagetic audio ripped straight from alien  They couldn’t even be arsed to do their own music
Still haven’t seen the second one yet so I can’t wait to binge watch 1 and 2 and then head to the theaters 🥰
Yes!!! Finally an apocalyptic movie in ages! Feels like the whole film industry just went down hill since Covid
Worth Waiting......
Why only they will rule the market big content creators !!??😩☹️🥺  When will I be trending tooo I don't think I will ever be trending 😞😣🥺 2:23
This movie make 2024 best summer memory ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Also just imagine.. like in the middle of the chaos. People screaming getting picked off left and right. Crazy. Looking amazing lol.
Part 3 now!!!
Imagine the movie Alien going to day one.
Enjoyed parts one and two. This new version looks fantastic
1:30 I don’t know how these creatures were perfectly jumping through glass if they are blind
I love this series!!!!
Biggest load of WOKE DIVERSE CRAP i have seen
I WAS soooooooooooooooooooooo hoping for more from this universe! Can't wait! they could do "Day 1" films for SO MANY places experiencing day 1.
If that cats dies then we go to war!!!!
Definitely going to see this!!
Best part of qp2 was the opening few minutes—the rest sucked. Glad the makers agree and theyre doing a whole movie about the start of the alien invasion but way bigger. 👍
Как называется?
bro imagine they drop this day on day one on paramount.
I really don’t want to watch a movie about a bunch of 👩🏿‍🦱👨🏿‍🦱🧑🏿‍🦱
oh so quiet  by Bjork  1995
CHILLS.
So instead of part 3, we get a prequel to something that we already learned/seen in the 2nd movie
OHHHHHHUUUUU I'LL BE SEATED, JOHN
Why is it always white people or black people now? Why never hispanics or asians as the main character
Movies with black leads are unwatchable.
Айде, чакаме !
Wonder if its as boring as the others 😴😴😴😴
Different director and different casting will ensure this movie gets 5/10 and a big flop in a series.  People hate if their favorite cast is completely moved out.
The music in the end is from Alien Covenant called 'Spores'…...I wonder if there's going to be a correlation between the two films!
How sweet, dark meat
Awwwwwesome...
Cat better live
Wow so excited 😍👍
no way
Watching this in theaters is going to be one of the best moments of my life
I bet that cat has a bigger role than people think.
Was hoping to see Millicent the deaf Hottie !!
Really milking this one weak plot idea, eh Krasinsky? It has all been a fail since the parents in the first movie walked away from their smallest kid so he could get slaughtered. Geniuses
What happened to the cat?
After So Long To See The Movie Like This 🥺
Why does she have a cat? WHY DOES SHE HAVE A CAT? WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO PETS IN THIS KIND OF MOVIES HUHUHUHUHU
another attempt to oh never mind
Talk about saving the cat
THE COUNTDOWN STARTS NOW.
🤸🏿🚓
It’s Gonna be terrible.its gonna feel like a totally different film with the same aliens in, Script and directing isn’t done by John krasinski.
perfeito.
This is gonna be awesome. Great cast too.
Ok finnaly we get a better understanding of who these creatures really are
I hope the cat survive as well... :C
My favorite movie
There goes that alien covenant sound track at the end
i have been waiting for day one . I thought they should show what happened on that day. No idea they will do it as a prequel
1:05 I don't see no dog.  Y'all know what happens...
The cat better survive or I'm boycotting
YESSSSSSS
OOOOOO YESSSS LETS GO
ooooh i like the 3 actors! looking forward to this!
the last part sound came from tiktok i guess 😂
Can’t wait…Shhhhhh📽️🎞️📽️🤐
I’m such a big fan of the quiet place movies so seeing the beginning of where it all started is so exciting
Indian fans❤❤❤
THE POOR CAT
excited!
This movie release date .. plz respond I'm so excited
seeing her with a cat made my anxiety SPIKE
if the cat dies then i’m never watching any movie ever again
Dimana Emily Blunt ?
Poor cat
Maybe the aliens just want to give us real free quality health care without a catch.
The country side was only the landing zone
So they used Krasinski's character to sell the sequel and now they're using the Abbott family to market the prequel.  Nice swapping, Paramount.
By the sounds from 1:13 sounds like they're gonna be a lot more and a lot bigger then the first two movies can't wait to see this one
YESSSSSSS
DEI full effect. Nobody will watch
Can’t wait! one of my favorite movies.
Nah we need TV series for this🔥🔥🔥
But does the cat live?
Not exactly the part 3 I was hoping for. I wanted to see what happens next not before. Hollywood always finds innovative ways to milk a franchise.
Ohhh lupita is about to give us something phenomenal and then disappear for 2 years
EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE ..
Didn't they already show what happened when the aliens first came on day one in the second movie?
Who the flip cares how it happened? Haven't they said enough about things took place.
L movie
Just some ideas from sci fi movies from possible futures to the present......  Should someone built sonic guns just in case...?!  electromagnetic guns for invisible alien invaders like ... ? and so on
I love both joseph and lupita so much! i’m absolutely thrilled to see my girl a lupita doing another horror movie! i think she portrays being scared so well
... We can't beat things with hypersensitive hearing... You all really think that? Okay.
Holy Moly!  That's One Scary Movie....!  I love the First and Second ones to and this ain't gonna be epic..🖤❤
Alien invasion, but with a new twist; they are hostile....oh wait.
Why show a trailer so far away from release date… smh. Slick
Excited for this movie❤
This movie is at the top of my list to watch in 2024. I am so excited what is in store for us to see in the movie.
Never thought that the sound of silence would be this scary
scream queen Lupita
The type of movie to see in a theater without a doubt!
Brave woman cowardly incompetent man....im calling it now
But wasn’t day one for John krasinski’s family too? Or it happened at different times in different locations?
J'ai hâte de le voir
Don't eat beans. Never, ever eat beans....
hollywood working those quotas hard.... this will flop
Holy moley! That's intense! 😲
Oh nooo they coming.....
Not gonna watch if the cat dies <3
Of course it's simply an alien invasion. I bet we summoned them with one of our galactic frequencies and they're just hear to shut us up.
This is going to be AWESOME
Woke Race Swapping  Again Agenda 2024
Looks great.  May actually have to go to a theater again to see it.
We're supposed to believe " these people" can be quiet?
So little dialog, but so impactful
JOSEPH QUINN AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
😮
We need a continuation
Eh kinda over it. We know what happened in the 2nd
Jesús Christ is the only hope of this world 🌎
Jesús Christ is the Rock of our salvation
Little confused by the SU Flankers at 1:00 when the movie's set in NYC. Minor nitpick.
I love seeing Djimon Hounsou get more and more roles.
Ok yeah I get they came from space and they’re tough. But are you saying an A-10 couldn’t handle them? Kind of a big plot hole there ngl
Plot twist: This are bio-engineered xenoforms that a greater species orbital bombarded our planet with.
Nice trailer ❤
Absolutely can not wait
Im so excited!!
Great world they’ve created fr. They can have so much fun and freedom with it I love every movie
Can’t wait!!!
This looks AMAZING!!!
It's just silly cause the military would have destroyed these things.
Oh, I can't wait to see this.
Another crap
Where are the Latino and Asian actors
Did we need this movie?
Man Hollywood really won't rest until they have beaten every dead horse for everything it's got. Can't wait to see another decent franchise slowly sink into mediocrity.
Somehow the direction they took with this doesn't surprise me in the least.  Hard pass
Eh.  The first two were poetic.  This one just feels like a blockbuster cash grab.
no, thank you
Ela tem um gato! 😮
It's not Part 3, but I'm still hyped for this film!
Well we all know what happens to that guy
I’m so excited for this!!!
Why movie and not a serie? It would be 💯
Music used from the prometheus/alien movie is dope
I'm so excited to see Lupita and Joseph on the big screen together 🤩🤩
Was that Djimon Hounsou again? That dude is such a great actor —so much emotion in his roles. Dude doesn’t get enough recognition.
Yes!! A proper prequel!! Can’t wait to see it 😊
Lupita! Wow
I love the balck guy from blood diamond but this looks way over cetenred around black folks. I get the first 2 movies wer white but i hope theres more variety.   I dont want this to feel like a jordan peele movie were is horror revolving around black cast. I love the peele movies but this would be a whole coin flip if it went that route from what it started
Still mad at the son from the last movie
How's Dwight's going to survive that?
Why is it focusing on a black girl?  Where is the cast from the first two?  If they aren’t in it, then it’s a waste to see it
I only care if the cat survives. The moment something happens to him, i'm leaving the theater.
How about nooo, Scotty.
Great, now everybody is black? This wokeness is played out.
Can’t wait for the right wing mob say the movie is “woke” cause there is a black main character.
They brought the cat lol I'd do that too
A New 2nd Main Character, the Cat😂
This is the movie I've wanted to see. How it started.
We’ll finally get to see how this all started and hopefully why. I wonder how many people died in all 3 movies.
Awesome 😅
I’ve watched both and I’m ten and I’ll do the same with this one of the best movies
The clicking and hissing is going to make this much scarier
It's interesting how white people are now a minority group.
Hec yeah!
inner city quiet place for a "modern audience".
Who else is here from the Super Bowl ad?
BS. Old dated and seen before🙃
I’m so excited.
What a shame we won’t get to hear a black woman speak for 90 minutes.
This with Lupita is going to 🔥
Looks like "Day 1" in the second movie was an appetizer and "Day 1" in this movie will be the main course..... I'm in!
How you gonna keep a cat quiet😂?
1:28 Alien Covenant sound effect?
Why does it have the same music as alien covenant?
Seriously hope Emily and Cillian are in this movie too their all amazing
I hope the cat pulls through.
Can't wait 🇹🇹💯
The cat is 100% gonna save her and break my heart
how it all started? I'm sold 😎
This is so interesting!
Nice comedy
This trailer have a sound like the one of Alien Covenant
We wuz Kingz'n shiiieeeett
What if the monsters have no name because you can't say anything?
I’m watching anything with Lupita in it, can’t wait to see this
It is me, or are these quiet place films getting louder?
They should make a movie how the world reacts when we go offline for 1year
Espero que el gato esté bien
Best trilogy bro.
TAKE MY MONEY
A PC Place: Woke One
Black edition
Amazing! This is what we need, i cannot wait to watch it.
Let's see
About time there is a reason to go the movies again
😢
of course
Shes running with a cat in the final scene 0_o
i always wonder if they put loud music like in stadiums what will happen????? 🤔 and people doing there regular life ..
Saw two great actors and I'm sold...That's it🙌🏽🙌🏽
Meh, too much marvel style cgi
So excited....
Is this a pre-quel and not considered the 3rd and final installment?
these mfs when I show them a claymore strapped to a boombox
Can they please stop using animals in movies, that alone makes me not want to see it
TEXT 'BE QUIET'.  that's funny, because most likely, half the people in the theater will be talking on their cell phones all through the movie.  such are the times.
Forza cat! ❤
This is Quiet place Prequel story.  Awesome.
🚮
Just another woke movie, no, no, no and 100x no, thx. No pay for it, and no watchin.
please add some fighting with guns and action not a family chores of days of our lives., having baby in this worse times etc, i am hoping day one will help and show how they could not fight back lol
How the cat survives is going to be a tough ask. They've got to find a way.
Jim Halpert prank
This is what I've been thinking about through both other movies. Their arrival, the chaos of destruction, the realization of their abilities.
Одни негры ((
A DEI Place
Vera level trailer.. en language la sonnaa romba awesome aa irukum
World war Z typa vibe
1:05 She looks CG? 🤔
Love this film series! Can’t wait for this one!
Is it just me or does this look & sound the same as every other alien invasion / doomsday / superhero movie? Is there nothing new?
Woke Hollywood at it again. Pathetic.
Interesting to see how they have the aliens be so successful in near exterminating the human race. Nothing we have seen in the first two movies has shown us that the army wouldn't be able to take care of them after initial large casualties.
Oscars worthy anyone  👇Hit that like button
So excited
Literally everything needs an origin story apparently
Only in theaters?!?! Ugh!!!!!!!!!!
too hate
trop hate
Nothing better than a horrible movie. :)
Si se muere el gato me muero 😭
Could you use any more cgi?
I am soooo ready! Lupita BRING it, girl!
Save kitty!
NOT THE CAT
Gotta wait until June 😢
Letsss goooo im amped!!!❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥reminds me of “I Am Legend”
not the car dudeee
She left the car, save car 😩
Patiently waiting
All of a sudden they add a black character
It's funny how Hollywood made a black female lead a red flag for anyone considering watching a movie. They literally made turned it into what they thought they were fixing.
Where is cillian ?
Why ???? I want to seee the future !!!!
I can't wait p
These movies make no sense at all. As humans it's not possible to be quiet... We fart, we cough, we sneeze, we breathe, our bones crack and make noises, and we have heart beats... For Aliens that have super hearing they sure have random super slective hearing. Don't think people realize how loud breathing can be when it's quiet.
I’m not expecting a masterpiece like the first one, but this one has potential to be a lot more fun.
At 1:00 those are Su-27 Russian fighters...did Russia invade?!
Music similar to alien Prometheus
1:00 is Russian Air Force Jets
Вторая часть очень разочаровала, по сравнению с первой
Weightingggg
As a joke I’d fart as loud as I could when those creatures were searching for me 🎉
I'll be in the theater!
if the Bird Box and Quiet Place aliens decided to have a baby we would be f’d
3 films running the same premise might be strethcing it for this franchise I think...
Prequel I guess. Or something of that nature.
Smart move.
More PC BS
C’mon I they could’ve made about the original family during day 1.
the scene after she wakes up with the dust on her face remembers me on matrix when they are hiding from these weird things trying to be quiet
Let me guess, the white guy will be cowardly and stupid and the black woman will be a strong female character.
Word of advice in every movie.  Stay out of the middle of the street, hall corridor...etc 👀
milking the cow...
How many times they destroyed newyork in movies😅
i can't not wait... :O
J'avais adoré le 1 et le 2 ! Hâte de découvrir comment tout ça a commencé 🎉🎉🎉
“All right, we made enough money on the first one. Let’s put the monsters in the second one.”
And they just had to cast a black woman for the main character.
The fact they added Cillian Murphy I will definitely be watching come on 28 days later 💁🏽‍♂️
bet...
i hope she and the cat survives 😭
Why is This Movie so popular?! I watched the First One and it was so ridiculous and Bad.
I never watched the 2nd one but I loved the first one. Def going to see this
Oh this is going to be a GREAT franchise!!! I'm all here for it!!!
These movies are all so stupid I can’t believe how many people like them. The most overhyped series in the entire horror genre. Absolute trash 😂
I absolutely hate public places and people so I’ll have to wait to watch this at home but it looks awesome
The planet needs more spin-offs
I have a spectacular idea. Let's do another lord of the rings trilogy. But this time, we will do it from the perspective of the shire folk who stayed in the shire...😂
aaaaaaand off course shes black. seems like hollywood is  gonna ride the agenda train  to the end. ruined the second movie replacing the man with a woman, now were going deeper with a black woman. I bet shes lgbtqlmnop?><)^*#&$ as well.
Lupita is in,definitely something to look forward to
This time it's in the city that's a completely different concept...👎
BUT DOES ANYTHING HAPPEN TO THE CAT??????
Interesting. This is not directed by John
المؤثرات الصوتية الرهيبة لي بالفيلم بكل أجزاءه من احد الاسباب الجيدة لي خلت الفيلم ينجح فعلا واااااوو ❤
So now we are literally remaking the exact same movie that they made the first/2nd time. They made a quiet placejust another blatant example of Hollywood being so inept and not creative at all. It's really sad. They are literally remaking the exact same movie but just race swapped....lol
I just realized I never watched the 2nd movie. I watched the first, loved it. Then watched YouTube videos discussing the 2nd movie. I have to watch it before the 3rd
Am I the only one who feels like this franchise is being milked to the point of obsolescence
That cat better survive
Where’s the original cast members?
Dhan'yabāda āpanākē bhā'i ēta sundara ţipasa āmādērakē dē'ōýāra jan'ya
absolute layup of a hit
A boxticking place. Day 🤡🤡📦✅️🤡🤡
Nobody: .... Thumbnail: A quiet ni-
Can't wait
Wow. Second movie in about a week that appears to have Black actors playing characters who are Black rather than Black Characters. I love it.
John Krasinski is brilliant and did a fantastic job with the first two. This looks like it will hold up well.
Context please anyone?
The fact the “Alien” movie soundtrack was thrown in there makes me want to see it even more
I love this movie.. next one make “A Quiet Place: The Hood” Ay Cuh… 🤫🤫🤫 🤣🤣🤣
Just hope the cat survive all this!
I’m so hyped
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What the heck 🤯
Wow amazing
okayyy let's go June!
SOOO EXCITED!!! The first two were incredible! 🙌🏼
I would've love to see the whole world in that moment. Not only 1-2 protagonists, but more. More scenes, more countries.
I like this movie
So basically a quiet place 2 but in a city. Idk ill still watch but they're bordering on "milking a series for money until it sucks" territory
We already know why the world went quiet, I want to see the next chapter from Part II. I'm still mad with the UNDERWORLD saga making this same mistake with rise of the lycans, we saw enough back story in the first two, so just CONTINUE THE STORY! We already know that none of these people survive! so, just CONTINUE THE STORY! 😩
Yo is that white face dude?
Is that ruthpeter thiong'o?
YAWN
How many Quiet Place movies are yall going to make? Dang we don’t need any more 😂
Super flop shows again
Can't wait
Great trailer
The Quiet Place 3: Affirmative Action 😅
Lupita nyong the academy Award winner... She's gonna nail this too...
did people forget the opening 10 mins of the second movie?? that showed day one...in a different location...... remember..the baseball game...the fireball in the sky..we saw muiltiple creatures then too............... ust saying..that was day one as well...... nice to see it expanded on though..............
Weren't they in Amistad together?
Day 1 is always the most interesting part in any apocalypse/zombie film or show, compared to the rest of it. Happy with this
1:26 did they use the Alien Covenant  "The Medbay" intro sound?,  are they hinting some relation between those franchises two or what?
How many of these little bastards are there
Huhu the cat
One of the best stories really. I don't think I'll enjoy this movie any less than the original.
I think that we can all agree that while end of the world films may be great and the story we get along after it, in every apocalyptic movie we always love to see the fall and end if civilization before it just as this one is. I am very excited to see this
WOKEness …
She must really love that dog.
Alien & zombie, always this 2. 🙂
Yessss🎉
Dont understand why they dont continue from part 2
A world where introverts flourish😅
So … Alien movie
AWEsome, Finally. The Beginning on how it All Started.. The Atmos should sound S I C K.....😲😂😂😂😂
Outstanding  Got it
My summer plans are summer planning!!
The story we needed
Oh my
1:27 Sounds like from Alien: Covenant Upd: yes it is
A quiet place 4: Before the beginning of day 1.
The first two were bangers and I absolutely plan on seeing this one, too! The Quiet Place and Don't Breathe franchises are two of my favorite suspense/thriller franchises to have come out in modern times!
🤫🧏
Looks great !!! Can’t wait
First one is better'....
Not going to lie - this popped up and I thought meh same old story but wow this cast combination and short trailer leave much to the imagination, Now I am proper hyped
WHERES NOAH JUPE?!?!?!
Won’t see it without John k sorry
نعم نعم تابعت 2جزء والان متحمس إلى 3❤❤
Thanks for showing the movie in less than 2 minutes. You've saved my time.
Same sfx from Alien Covenant? Love it!
sequel, after sequel, after sequel followed by spinoffs then after that remakes...
I love it... Waiting for this o e
First two suck, why not try a third time?
Please. No more.
So, go back to the beginning AGAIN - but black. pass
WWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I think I need to watch the other quiet places before watching this one so I can understand. Comes out in summer gives me enough time to catch up.
Am I the only who worried about the cat 😆😆
Yes please 😮
Joseph!!!
I much prefer this version because the silence in the middle of nowhere was really boring I could never finish because I always fell asleep
I’m so here for a Quiet Place franchise Krasinski and Blunt should take a bow!!! Strated something great
DEI
what will make me wait for june to see this masterpiece🙂❤️‍🔥
Looks epic can't wait! Btw, great thumbnail for this video!
Sorry. But I'm worried about the cat
Joseph Quinn,my rockstar ❤❤❤
please tell me the cat is safe...
LOVE she still saves the cat
it'not quiet anymore 😁
the thumbnail looked like she was picking her nose lol
Be Quiet
The darkening of Western film franchises continues....
Now this is what the world now.. silenced over craziness.. if you talk you will be targetted.. i like this movie came out just in time
June is too far!!!! Can't wait! Lupita and Djimon!!!! 👏👏👏
Is that Cillian Murphy? 🧐
Love from Bangladesh ❤❤ wating for movie
Milleti part time iş diye obone yorum beğeni diye kandırmayın
Brought to you by netflix
I’m here for the CAT 🐱
Im loving this franchise of The Quite Place. Can't wait for the asian version, where the aliens where made into street foods.
oy promising ha
this movie is gonna be huge exactly what it needed if it wanted to continue
That cat better make it the whole way through or we gonna have a problem
im actually hyped for this!
I love this prequel
Finally
One of the few times lately where I'm excited to see them expand on a concept. I don't mind if they keep making movies for this universe
If the cat dies I’m quitting life
I feel like this movie is gonna be everything but quiet
So Excited for This 🔥
the real award winning actor should be the cat in lupita's arms
Mid
😍
Soooooe xcited!
I wish everybody would shut up about this movie
Why do Alien Invasion always initiate in New York City? Maybe these aliens are related to Independence Day movie!
Istg if the cat dies
Yes, please. ❤  Great to see Djimon again, too. ❤
I don’t understand if this is a real trailer, the OST is by Alien Covenant…
01:00 minute mark - russian jets.
monke edition
Still no sign of military fighting…..
Mükemmel
This looks better then the last 2 js
I'm afraid that the kitty in the movie will make a loud "meow" and... :(
Cant wait in cenema
LUPITA!!!
Day 1❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Even though i love A Quiet Place movie series 💙💙💙  i facepalm & tell myself: ''Ok here we go again, aliens attacking NYC."  😆😆
Yesss! Finally they'll show how all things changed
Kenyans in the house.
LUPITAAA
Imao was the sound design made by a kid???
forcing  black ppl 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮 no thanks
This is exciting!!!!!
I am no longer at the edge of my seat,,,,someone in the comment section plz say what happened to me😮
Such an interesting concept! I mean the first thing you'd do if you saw aliens land in front of you is scream and run for your life and that's exactly how these aliens know where their prey is and that's likely why a majority of Earth's population was wiped out so quickly in this story, the last thing anyone would do is stay still and dead silent.
Kaliteli bir filme benziyor ne zaman çıkıyor
Bruh, they did not shy away from showing off that it's gonna be much more CGI-VFX heavy than its predecessors. Betting it'll have to do on par with the OG ($188M dom./$334M int'l) to be a hit.
00:27 if that cat dies im going to cry😅
Here for it!
They use same sound effect from alien covenant
Sjw ruined it
How many died ?
Prequel 🔥
this is one of the smartest move in a movie franchise
The fact that even a Cat is involved with this story scares me.. I hope the cat will survive.. though its 50% chance it'll happen..
Yawning
raz le bol des films sous titres j ai mal aux yeux et des difficultés pour lire les traductions qui sont souvent sur du blanc. Essayez un peu de comprendre jene paie pas pour rien. Merci
that cat better survive
i wish i had someone to watch movies with
Son aburridas...siempre lo mismo..los efectos especiales la salvan...pero no saben que hay cosas mejores..ya cansa tres pelis con lo mismo😮😮😢😢😢😢😢
CARALHO!!!! ISSO SIM É UM TRAILER!! sem revelar muito, mas ainda assim extremamente bem editado e q te deixa na expectativa!!!! Já assisti TANTO filme de terror/suspense q simplesmente perdeu toda graça justamente pq no trailer mostrava praticamente todas as cenas + importantes!!
Dastish Fantastish
Our own lupita Nyong'o from Kenya 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ give her some likes🎉
This is Best at this ...
praying for the kitty
AHHHH CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!
Imagine having a noisy baby in this situation
Are we still doing this???
That will be like the happening movie but a different country
Yay!! 🎉🎉
This is the frist movie.. I ever seen.. Which is going in reverse.. Frist came the 3rd part.. Then 2nd....now 1st..and all r best .. Mindblowing.. Edge of thr seat...
Meh...  Might pirate it at some point, definitely not gonna pay
1:25 did they sample it from alien covenant?
I have been waiting so long for this finally it is going to be 😊😊😊😊
Now this is a movie I’d like to see in the cinema 🙌🏻
Finally
this movie franchise deserves multiple installments
I am waiting for ❤
This is my favorite movie ever ❤
Paramount picturesi tebrik ediyorum mükemmel bir dizi🎉🎉🎉
I could be wrong.. didn't they play in a movie where they had to be quiet some time ago? I am sure I am wrong
Every 1like  1 push up  Bet!
めっちゃ楽しみ
Can we stop with the unnecessary sequels/prequels ? 🤦
Lupita scared reaction like the time she heard "keep my wife's name out your...." 🤐
Typical Hollywood. Make a semi successful film and then flog it until death. Stick a diversity hire lead in it for those quota tick boxes and spew it out to the consooomerrs.
But the cat? 😢
I am waiting. 😃
Hoping this can avoid some of the more head scratching moments of the first 2.
Boy o' Boy This one is looking pretty intense.
Finally... My prayers have been answers!
0:15 Shelby 🎉
Hope no one has a frickin' baby in the middle of all this
I actually want that cat to stay alive ☹️
Who are INDIANS like It❤❤❤
Looks great
Awesome
izlediğim en güzel filmdi
Yet another Hollywood disaster film not worth seeing or caring about
Im  so hyped for this this movie even though im not suprised they made it. A quite place deserves a prequel to really show us the origins of this alien race that would later go on to wipe out the world
its written in the holy book that this monsters will come soon.. and torment us all
meh
Amazing 😮
Idk why i realized they are going to make long sequels about this movie with a long loved story❤
Lol n here i just saw A Quiet Place Part 2
Meh, looked like crap
Favorite movie list ❤
already the best movie contender
Best❤❤❤
It's weird that they are developing a character who literally made the worst 5-second decision in pt2 and got offed. Hounsou deserved better, but at least they might rectify it in this prequel.
Is this the real trailer
It s like birdcage but instead of not seeing the don’t talk
did they copy cat the sound effect from alien covenant movie or what, why so smiliar.
They had to have added rainbow colors with high saturation making the movie negrocore cause the first two were too white for their lil fragile ego
lol it's the music of alien covenant at the end
1:08 Just a finger away from that mewing meme 😅
Same think happen  in palastine current  situation 😢😢😢
Thats Nakia
Best sci-fi horror ever...
കിടിലം 🎉
Personally I thought the other 2 were kinda crap, but this looks like it may have more going for it.
looks solid
Give this bullshit a rest now please.
The disney version.
Déjà vu !!
From low budget movie become an epic sequel
honestly, i'm just happy that this movie is following different characters, because it would be a shame to ruin the whole plot of the MASSIVE Regan/Emmett fanfic i've written
I can't wait....
i would like to see they do 'reign of fire' where the dragons destroyed civilization
*CAN'T WAIIITTT*
The cat better live
excited
CANT WAIT!
Eddie Munson is not dead. He just went to another upside down world.
The scream
Yeah right no day 1
A Movie About Mewing??? BYE BYE 🗣️ See You In Theaters
The great TUBALATION COMETH.¬REPENT % JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON
Gives "war of the worlds" feeling.
Idk whats worse , The Quiet Place Pandemic or the Birdbox Pandemic
I love the story arc, I love the actress. I‘m so in for this.
Ab ayga na maza ... Mjhe frst day dkhne ka bht Mann tha , finally aa gya
Is that Eddie?! HUBYFFGUYBIFYTF
I'm so excited for this. Been waiting for another movie to come out. Honestly though they can also make a TV serious too given how much potential content they can come up with!
I hope the military gets more screentime
YESSSS LUPITTAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
Jim halpert's been busy!
Ah another black lead.
Will this movie be as overrated as the first two?
they love to steal
MOvie ? I hope its not the series compiled into one movie.
The ray tracing in this game is phenomenal!
No. Giving more lore to the monster makes it less scary.
❤❤❤❤ https://youtu.be/XRny1xQ3KR0?si=dSF5BjXpvemUl1M_
Any one 🎉Tamil Fans
yes yes yes yes yes yes
Birdbox with can't see, A quiet place with can't speak. Now what? A movie with can't hear?
I already knew 2024 will be a crazy year
Bad. Next.
John Krasinski is the best of the best.
okay please let be the last one you guys are starting to juice it.
Блин, вот обязательно добавлять котов в хоррор-фильмы? Я ж переживать буду-_-
No need to watch movies of destruction while people are being killed and put under the worst conditions in Palestine in front of the eyes of everyone.
oh so this is another camera angle wow
Yet another attempt to manifest a dark timeline hahah no thanks
If its Lupita in a horror movie im sat
I fart a lot. I wonder how many seconds i survive in that environment 😂😂
I thought quiet place “2” was the day 1 prequel?
The same idea but they give it to block people coz they don't have new Ideas. Sorry guys.
I hope they know it will be a big 'nope' if the cat doesn't make it
wow awesome and mind blowing love this franchise cant wait
Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥
1:25 is the music from Alien: Covenant
urrrr maahhh gurrrrd
I thought we got this already with a quiet place 2😂
What happened to the cat?
I'm prepping. They getting everyone hype off a movie when something may actually be in the works
This movie will win many awards at the Oscars. Can't wait to see this masterpiece !! ❤
Alien + War of the Worlds + Cloverfield + WWZ all in one !🔥
no way one of the best movies getting a sequel?
Well done 😊
Loved Djimon in Blood Diamond! Stoked they cast this talent
who noticed the music from the movie Alien Covenant
Hi
im here for the cat
I wonder if it the man's wife the on the island from part 2 is the main character
So how many movies in which humans face monsters and have to be absolutely silent are they going to keep making?
BUT IS THE CAT OK???!!!!!
Looks cool, but also predictive programing for the fake alien invasion false flag.
Then We will hear lot of Noise ✌🏻
I think this is the only monster where it made logical sense to land in India first...monster that doesn't allow to honk, an Indian's nigtmare!
imagine discovering that you snore 💀
That cat better survive the entire movie. That's all I'm saying.
Hyped to see this takes place in a big city with a stand off against the military not just in a small town with just 1 cop with a gun. It’s like tom cruise war if the world.
I literally had no idea this movie was coming out and watch part one and two today.m❤
Thank goodness there’s some diversity in this movie this time!! The first two had way too many white people. Sick of the white washing in everything.
IM READY
❤❤❤😍😍
I wish South African politicians could have this experience, cos we have radical ones in our midst who are experts at fooling illiterate voters.. 😂
Nice
Africa?
Awesome 😊
We still belch and fart. What about squeaky shoes or rusty gates?    Or your mum going oink while I dog her?
The cat... this movie better show me the cat surviving.
Another movie that is going to be exploited to the max and also with the need to add protagonists of color because we millennials "like" inclusion 👍👍👍
#CANTWait😮⌛️
Great franchise  🎉🎉🎉
The music been used from Alien covenant
im unironcailly so excited
I wasn’t disappointed with the sequel and had no intentions of watching the third installment…but if Lupita Nyong’o is in it, game on.
Can’t wait to see this.
I hope the cat survives
Amazing Franchiseeeee ❤️💗💗❤️💗❤️
I'm guessing the first two were too white they must fix that
Jirrr pasti keren bangetttt
Jirrr pasti keren bangetttt
🤫 Shhhh... I--CANNOT--WAIT...UPPER ESCHELON ACTORS, LUPITA & DIJMON SCI/HORROR TEAM-UP, OOO'WAAAH!!!
I need to know what happened to my fellow feline and if he or she survived *meow*
Meh
Wait wait is this trailer real?
This seems more like an attempt to add racial diversity to the Quite Place brand
I need to know what happens to the cat
finally ...
Bro yessss
Now you know what happened in Florida's shopping mall.
1:27 - same sound used through the soundtrack from Alien: Covenant
The aliens don't want humans to talk so they can mew
The agenda movie that tells us not to use our voice with all the crazy lies of the swamp people behind governments.
Охуенно
Just a normal day in the library
If anything happens to the cat I'm suing
Glad the camera is still and not going haywire like in other movies
No need to twist my arm, I'm in!!!!!!!!!
YES YES YES ❤❤❤
I want the cat to survive
Ok but I need to know if the cat survives!
It was short
Will definitely be watching this movie 🍿😮
Why
This movie shows the start of the 476 day mewing streak.
super hyped for this film 100%.......
i cant survive in that situation if i have an asthma attack lol
More useless fear and paranoia for the masses.
so it's cloverfield
Interesting
yes! i am deaf
ah
The last background music made me remember Alien covenant its gonna be Funnnn
OOHHHHHHHHH I MISS THIS KIND OF TRAILER!! LEZGOOOOOO
Glad that John Krasinski care bout his fans:)
The trailer is absolutely terrifying! I hope the movie is the same.
This seems very awesome, can't wait for this one to come out
didn't they already show day 1?
Wow nice Alien Covenant music at the end
I’m so excited!! This is what I want to see. We got a taste of it in the second movie but prefer to watch everything manifest vs skipping a few months post invasion.
Who’s excited to see the cat in this movie? 🙌🏻
BLM the documentary.
Crap.
Lupita Nyongo y'all ❤🎉
I can’t believe Paramount Pictures only paid Terrence Howard $12,000 for the movie Hustle And Flow!!  Daylight robbery right there
Does the kitty make it?
Cloverfield 1.1
it's gonna be hard to watch animals getting killed by those mfs bu i'll give it a try
I feel bad for whoever has diarrhea
When will it release?
Keep silence
Not watching if the cat dies 😢
oh you KNOW they made this for the people who loved the first episode of the last of us lol
I am bored seeing same stories
can't wait to stress out about this cat for two hours
Bad movie
This prequel looks so genuinely interesting ✨
Now it makes sense humanity fell, if they dropped literally all over the place at once. This movie seems promising
DEI cast on point
where is that british wife of jim halpert?! why blk ppl casted?.?
Boring
Lupita❤
A raptor fighter jet would for sure be able to take out these things
In the biggest cities will be its finest target
Complete garbage
Apparently we needed the black version as well. Hollywood is a pandering clown show.
I don’t know. I think that sort of removes the horror factor. The reason the first one was so appealing to me was because of the mysteriousness of the monster. An you question what they are because you never really see them. Now it feels just like a monster alien invasion instead of horror.
I'm so excited to see Lupita and Joseph on the big screen together 🤩🤩🤩
What is Jim from the Office doing there?
I hope the cat lives till the end of the movie
Nice more token blacks
Did they use Russian Jets?
Amazing
YESSSSSSS.
I always wonder about the starting and how it began.. here you go.. it looks even scarier :P
June is too far 😪😪😪
We back babby
Lupita the queen of thrillers😌
Thank you guys for showing how it all started
My ankle pop with every move. Goodbye everyone😂😂😂
Bruh if you look out the window at 1:16 you see the speed of the herd running but around 1:20 you see the usain bolt monter that one is mad fast😮
Why can’t they just release this on the Super Bowl game time?
Why stop at day one? Lets get a day -100 and it can just be a regular movie
I can't wait for this film!
Representation!
Some city action. Yes I'm assuming another with the original cast will be coming also
Djimon and Murphy
Finally a movie franchise that includes a black lady. It's her turn, folx
When you run out of concepts so you just make the same movie😂
Oh man, I know that cat aint gonna make it
That cat will be best actor
I knew eventually they couldn’t go 3 movies in without diversity hires to please the wokies
That looks really look and it makes sense.
Ok i think i am the only one who wants to see part 3 of the family that separated ..I am so curious about what happened to them..
Those repeated screams were so annoying
I got anxiety just watching this 😂
Music by Jed Kurzel?
It will suck and all of you morons will love it.
The last movie i saw in theaters. Went to the bathroom and took a few hits off my THC vape pen, went back in, sat down, had a panic attack.
When a movie starts with aliens falling from the skies it usually is garbage
im done im in can't wait to see it
0:05.  Ummm, serious question?  How did they get the candles lit?  Were they going cave man and have a burning candle   flame for 472 days..  Am i wrong ?
If teh cat dies we riot.
When will they learn?? Go woke, go broke!
Farts are SERIOUSLY deadly in this universe😂
1:00 Why are there Sukhoi Su-27s? Are there gonna be scenes in Russia/East Europe?
absolute stellar cast so far
Ah yes....the politically correctness. 2 movies with white people. Now let's make one with black ones so we seem legit....
We gotta call the Avengers, or the Ghostbusters, or El Chapulín Colorado.
Only in theaters 😂 Right….. I dare you
Finally something to look forward too!
Diversity
I just hope people in theather be quiet too.
The movies are cool but it seems like there's a glaring plot hole.  We have a very noisy planet and there are electronic devices everywhere.  It's kind of hard to believe that as billions of people were offed by these things that at no point did anyone observe a reaction to a radio giving feedback at the frequency from the 1st film.  Also how is it even remotely possible that DU rounds don't go through their bodies?
cat :)
Im so excited!! 😍😍😍
June - we only in Feb 😩🤬 it feels like we have had 5 months of 2024 already 😳😱
Franchises everywhere.
I was walking outside when I noticed people where noticing me noticing them and realized that none of them noticed
Wack
can't wait
I don't know. We've already seen how it starts in the second movie. It's time to show how it ends now.
I'll watch this movie for the cat alone 😂
So this is now part of the ALIEN universe?
So this is just Birdbox but with sound instead of sight, right?
Hard pass
Ooooooooh!! I've been curious about that!!
im expecting Lupita breaks her silence in the movie to shout Black Lives Matter
I thought this was a joke 😂 why are we still dragging this film on
The contrast is unbelievable
"You loved our a-list cast in the suspenseful horror of the first 2 movies? Yeah? Well, forget all that. Here's a bunch of new people you've never heard of. And explosions, everyone loves explosions!"
yawn
And it comes out during my birthday month!!!!
O my gosh yessssss!!!!
Can’t wait
I swear if that cat dies I am WALKING OUT OF THE THEATER
Is it filmed in Africa?
Passing gas never been more dangerous
A Quiet Place: DEI Edition.
Si algo le pasa a MICHI te funamos
I have to see this in the theater first!! 🔥🔥🔥
WoW they are really milking it.
I can't wait to see this.
Me: Can you just go one minute without talking  Them: … 🤟🏾🫰🏽✌🏽🫴🏽
Super excited!! Definitely going to theaters! 🫶
Please let the cat be ok.
At least I'd go out in my sleep. I snore.
if you think about it, humanity losing to these things if tens of millions of them if not billions landed on earth
Hated when the black guy died. Great movie.
You cant eat beans or drink soda in this world! +have allergies
When? Pfff! I need to know Why... 🙄🙄
I'm already in IMAX waiting for this movie to start 😳 🍿
Oh ho ho ho... I'm really looking forward to this new one. Glad to see how this invasion affects other areas of society, city dwellers. That'll be chaotic.
😳 Ok
Would love to see this one
looks fire!
Milking the franchise and expecting this to do well without the main characters from the series looks like a disaster
HOW DARE THEY USE THE PROMETHEUS SOUND AT THE END
LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!
THIS FRANCHISE IS AIMING TOWARDS THE BEST FILM SERIES ALL TIME 🏆💎
woke trash no ty
no cat in existence is going to be that chill in a situation like and as sad as it is you better chuck it as far as you can the second you realize noise attracts death.
Can't wait to see this!  The first two were amazing.
Yeah ngl this trailer did exactly what it was supposed to do
best thing in this trailer its his cat <3
From a small quiet movie to this noisy big prequel. Now looks familiar to other bigger budgeted franchises.
A second sequel to a solid movie (with a silly premise full of plotholes) that didn't need sequels in the first place. Now in summer blockbuster style...
Please tell me the cat survived
be quiet!!!
Well Duh! Everyone know Armagedon  is Coming. Thats Y the Elites are going into Bunkers
Yeah sure, I bet the blatant "diversity" will save this franchise
Nice mash up… almost got me
If anything happens to the cat, we riot.
yassss!
An hour of silence.
Hate these movies so much, the 2nd one was SO bad. Stoked for this one. Lupita is incredible and so is Djimon, his death in the 2nd was some of the worst writing i've ever seen, as well as the rest of the movie. Kinda cool that they stole that dope as musical stinger from Alien Covenant. It plays all the time during the Med Bay scene in that movie.
Gotta admit, knew it didn't just impact the area they lived in so I was curious how it was in big cities where it's just noisy non-stop.
WHY IS THERE A CAT
1:05 wow... really? they made her do white face?
It's always New York City. 😑 Can you chose a different metropolis and give us a break?
The music is Alien Covenant - The Medbay, right?
This is directed by John Krasinski right? It's very important to me that it is
I can't wait to see this! Lots of great new movies coming out in May and June.
EPIC
The first two were great.  I’ll check out the third for sure
W
This trailer looks fan made. It barely showed the creatures... sketchy
El día en que el mundo dejó de comer porotos....
It’s woke, lame
Is this sound from “Alien:Covenant”?
The way I will be getting my tickets day one
I cannot wait!
Is that CJ from wywrd pines?
2 amazing actors!
Im glad they used a couple of Africans for the lead roles and not Americans. Amiright?
No he ido al cine en mucho tiempo porque ni una pelicula me atrae y miren que yo antes de la pandemia salia mucho al cine. Esta pelicula si la voy a ver.
Movies where people are turned into a useful universal food group are gonna give some alien or extraterritorial race very, very bad recipe ideas.
😤
I can not WAITTTTT
Is this a prequel?
Круто. Жду
Scariest part is from 01:12 I would say, hearing how many of these creatures there really are
New York has to be the unluckiest place in film history
Finally we will see day one
Save cat ❤
Dang this monster scare ne to these days'
Why the usual suspects? Whites are becoming the minorities  now 😢
I hope that cat makes it
That looks amazing, and interesting.
So loud. That poor actor cat.
Obviously it needed the same film but more ethnics this time
Can’t wait would love to other actors in here some legends
I don’t see the difference between post apocalyptic New York and the current New York.
Didn’t we already see day one…
what quiet place 2 should have been
The prequel no one asked for…
I wonder what would have happend if they came and nobody made any noise.
Oooo this is going to be nice. We get to experience the quietness from the city view vs. the country.
That's 🔥🔥
Didn't watch the last two. This one got my attention as soon as I saw Lupita Nyong'o.
It looks amazing. Can't wait to see it🔥🔥
It looks awesome! 👌🏾
Lupita making us all Kenyans proud.
Looks like when the aliens begin terror attacks on cities in XCOM.
i swear if something happens to the cat 😢
This looks way better than the first two
The screams being turned into music was a great touch!
She's ready to protect that kitty with her own life ❤
I'm here for anything Lupita Nyongo!!!
When you realize you can make a franchise with really low audio costs.
I want to see what happens next with the family now that they figured out how to hurt the aliens.
What a surprise,  it's gone "racially diverse".
A Quiet Place : Living In Color Edition !
Oh I thought I was watching a New York migrant crisis documentary trailer
Haven’t even gotten to see the first two yet.
Not a fan, these movies are too fast paced and chaotic to be any type of scary, its more annoying than anything,  bunch of loud noises and chaotic cgi scenes showing flashes of vauge monster looking creatures that pop in and out of frame isn't very cool
Какой смысл делать ещё один фильм про первый день, вторая часть рассказала о начале события. Просто тупо выжимание денег из фоаншизы
Love this series.
Wow! I can't wait to see how people try to hide in those skyscrapers. Djimon Honsou being one of the main characters is fantastic!
Emily: so, how are we going to approach the third one? John: not sure, but we have a bigger budget… much bigger **NYC has entered the chat**
I wonder if it’s gonna show the scene where only one boat made it out of the harbor because people were scrambling to get off the mainland.
Can't wait! The sequel was awesome, so yes this will be climatic!
Djimon Hounsou! I love this actor, great choice! Movie looks promising.
A Woke Place...
面白そう！
Who's going to watch this for Eddie Munson?
Of course it’s 2 black people as the leads roles, why would be anything else? Pathetic virtue signalling.
Meh...
part two sucked, surprised they green lit another one.
😍😍🔥😭✨
Lupitaaaaaa
Cloverfield 2
I am not against the Nigros, but honestly I don't know why Hollywood is constantly using black community again and again due to which they are losing their audience and credibility among the global audience which are unable to relate them with the African community.  They have to be neutral, as James Bond, Marvels, Doctor Strange character etc all of them are unrelated to the Fanbase throughout the world
So they gonna make for each day a movie? 😂
A prequel huh? Interesting!  IRL I would not survive even seconds.
Blackwashed
Yess i always wanted them to do a quiet place before it started 😊
I know I’m goin to make sure I pack extra batteries because when the sound goes …
It's Not A Trailer, it's PURE GOOSEBUMPS!!
They are both brilliant actors...I just prefer still having original characters in the movie when making prequels.
They blackfaced a quiet place, instead of two white couples, its two black couples now...I wish they could have just brought back emily blunt and John at day 1; their acting was masterclass.
On the last seconds of this trailer I hear what sounds like the Aliens/Prometheus theme music. Is there/will there be a connection between these two franchises maybe?
I hope the cat remains okay.
Cloverfield to the Max!!!
HOLLYWOOD IS STILL, MAKING DUMB CGI CRAP EVEN IN 2024 🫵🏽🤗🤣🤣🤣
They don't stop milking it don't they?
A prequel of prequel
Man I done watched both of these movies if yall don't hurry up and wrap this shh up
Hope the cat makes it to the end.
The only movie which has produced better sequels agree?
Very stupid movie. In XXI century we have AI powered weapon targeting systems, nukes, Japanese powered armors and Polish valiant soldiers! No alien invasion would be successful. Especially those aliens relying only on brute strength and speed. So stuuupid movie - only for junkies!!!
A DEI place
Take my money ❤❤❤
A Quiet Place, only this time "adjusted" for the new Oscar's nomination requirements. If you know, you know.
Let’s Lupita NyonGOOOOO!!!
One day..
I need more trailer and the movie...now.
I was so scared at movie theater, of making noise, I  didn't open candy wrapper.
I gotta find out what happens to that cat
black woman powa will stop dem alienz and shiet, dats rite
black woman powa will stop dem alienz and shiet, dats rite
Am I the only person who didn't really care to see "why" our world went quiet? This isn't a question I needed answered or a story I needed to see.
I do love apocalypse movies with an emphasis on how it happened rather than how they’re going to fix it.
*Lupita running with a cat at the end* 😂😍
Again?
The aliens are very advanced but they are naked and they stupid😂
el gatoooo
Nuuuuuu já quero!!!
I hope the cat survives
Будем честны пришельцы бы мочили др др)) от низ шума больше чем от всего вокруг)
Can't wait
🤫🧏
Please, don't f this up with politics
I've got goosebumps just from the trailer...
My anxiety increased from thinking about the cat :(
finaly some explanation ....sooo they come from the sky?
They should quit it! The second movie ruined the series.
These creatures are racists.
I'm going to go full John Wick if something happens to the cat
1:05 White face is fine if it's a black person. White person with black face = Jail time.
As long as the cat's alive
Okay, I didn't know Lupita, Djimon, *and* Joseph was in it!! 😍😍😍  I change my mind. I'm down to see it.
Gonna be amazing.
They are really uglifying women in modern movies these days. Yikes 😬
So glad for Joseph Quinn!
Nooo, the cat
It's too bad I didn't see this trailer sooner. This movie is going to be awesome.
I'm so worried about the cat😢
I'm not going to watch it. The original cast is simply the movie's identity. The acting performance of Blunt and the kids  was terrific!
JIm Halpert created a horror masterpiece !
The stranger thing actor got role again.
gonna be fun watching how the directors try and make tanks unable to handle this
Well unless there's some macguffin that has so far not been revealed I don't see how they're going to make a decent plot of how the Aliens beat the Military. It was always better left to speculation
Yea I’m on it 😅😅
Are they still trying to milk this cow of a movie franchise??.. The first one was alright, the second one, not so much.  This third installment is just unnecessary.
😱😱😱😍😍😍love iy
this is how you make the same movie thrice and still it seems fresh as new!
Smart move to go back to day one, see how it all began. Have so much to work with. I’m all in. Can’t wait
I like that there is no talking .
Looks like "Left 4 dead" 🤣💥💥💥
Lupita Nyong'o is back.
Wow
Best Trilogy Ever?
🦍🌚🔫👮‍♀️👮‍♂️
It will be a huge flop.
Jesus Christ we really need another one of these movies
I’m excited
It's a cool idea on a series. They made the trilogy out of order.
Hehe
A pet in a scary movie? I hope the kitty survives :(
Anyone else feel bad for the cat? 😢 it’s always the animals that get to me 😢
Let’s diversify and ruin a series. Great
Aren’t we grown up yet😂😂
Hang on June? But they've just started doing re shoots for it again. Will they even make the deadline 🤷🏿‍♂️
Why do we need this?
Obviously they had to remake it with a black lead lol
Finally all the questions some people were asking about what the military was doing will be answered
Tough ask for a black woman to have to be quiet for any length of time 🤣
I hope the cat makes it
❤this franchise
AHHH I LOVE this AQP series! Can't wait to watch it!
No way!! Eddie Munson!!
A quiet place: Black edition
YESSS❤❤❤❤
They should have titled it Quiet Day -1 :)
I'M SAT🧎🏽‍♀️🧎🏽‍♀️🧎🏽‍♀️
Ridiculous
After minus one now I got this day one, im in love with number one this time🔥
Please! Tell me the kitty will be fine the entire movie😢. I will be thinking about the cat the whole movie.
She has a kitty, kitty better stay alive ! 🙏🏼😻
Of course they had the make the cast black
Here we go 🐵
blackwashed bs
Eagerly waiting for june to see this breathtaking film in theater.
They are milking this franchise lol and I'm honestly loving it 😂
These movies never make sense or explain anything....like the background of the monsters. These are not intelligent beings, and if one looks at their anatomy, one can see they are not engineered to build or fly advanced machines. They must have some type of overlords who are more evolved with fingers to grip small objects/parts or some type of telekinesis ability to move said objects or parts. These are just killing machines/weapons unleashed on Earth.
Awesome bro 🫂 What a great video and message 🫡
Best casting
This is Gog and Magog near the end of time
It looks great!
It was just a movie about not making sound, how did it turned into this badass 2nd prequel
The cat must live or we riot…quietly.
I thought Dua Lipa is in this movie when I saw the name Lupita😅
I just wondered what it’s like to get a common cold in this world. Your literally dead
This is a journey of how Rowdy place become Quiet place 🔊🤐
0:45 It's the Happy Wheels Moped Guy death sound effect.
ITS A MOVIE?! I thought it was going to be a TV show
DEFINITELY watching this!! The first two movies were fantastic. Love John Krasinski!!!
We know why it went quiet.. this seems redundant, we've seen day 1 already. Do a proper sequel. Resolve the trilogy.
Why does the thumbnail look AI generated? Seeing that it’s a real movie I know it’s not, but that was the first thing I thought when I saw.
How it all started
Yeah, baby! That one looks great^^
if the cat dies we riot.
Need to watch this ❤
So wait will we ever get a proper ending to this story, or is the left open ending to pt 2 the farthest we'll get?
I’d love for them to turn this into a saga one day, new stories, new characters/developments, new cities and maybe possibly new aliens. I’d like to leave it that these are the only creatures but what if.. hear me out. What if these beings were sent like dogs to attack quail, what if they were sent by a non primal species. That could be interesting but it’d have to be amazing writing and story telling!
Lupita+Thriller=🔥
Wait a minute they using Alien covenant soundtrack! So many movie using that sound
A quiet is not missing as a film series!
YES!!!!!
I loved the first two movies- glad to see more is coming out!
Lupita ❤
Yesssss
This looks utterly terrifying and I can’t wait for it to come out.
LOOK AROUND EVERYBODY ON MUTE
The backstory we needed to see. This is going to be a serve
Is it just me or does the first few seconds sound like Minecraft music?
YESSSS!!!!!
Can’t wait till June 😭 release it early
Todos lo veremos por el gato :3
As long as the kitty survives...
will they milk this crap for 6 movies hahaha
Someone is just going to have to tell me if the cat lives or dies and that will determine whether or not I watch this movie.
what’s going on at 1:20?
Do they ever attack each over by mistake?
cillian murphy rocking
look around everybody on mute
We finally get to see the epic fall of humanity that started it all
I'm wishing the cat will be okay
Because the white people are so noisy thats why.... 😊
Schrott
Lupita ❤❤❤❤❤
Turned it to a horror looking movie..
the best place to hide would be a library if this was real…
Sweet can't wait!
so forced
Sucks if you had to fart that day.
I SWEAR, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE ACTING OF THESE GREAT ACTORS, SPECIALLLLYYY CILLIAN MURPHY...!! 👌✨✌️🎉🎉🔥💖🥰
oh I'm seeing that they are upping the budget on this. Nice
imaginez ça en vrai
Hopefully, this treats the viewers as stupid and dumb as the previous films.
Looks like a fun invasion movie.
❤️🇧🇩
@cillian Murphy??! 🤔🤔🤔
Okey but the cat needs to survive please
The reason why they ever show the actual zombie appocolypse is because it’s utterly unbelievable aliens like this could win   “They are invincible” that’s dumb
at the very beginning the only thing i was thinking was WHERE IS THE CAT WHERE IS THE CAT
hope the cat survives
Don’t tell me the cat dies
😢😢
Lupita Nyong'o felt so right for this movie
SO EXCITED FOR THIS!
I'm about to mark my 🗓 now and watch this again 😃😁.
Why don't we have series of A Quiet Place.
Hindi dubbed me aayegi ky aawaz ni suni do movies me 😂
Still don't buy it, that it was such a massive invasion that it outnumbered military by that much.
what are Su-30's doing in New york? (1:00)
You can tell this is going to be fire already.
Wow
BONGGA !!!!
😂 silence please 🥺
Next movie : “A Quiet place 30 days before”
Lupita & horror movies are a match made in heaven. I just love the way she shows fear on her face! This trailer was epic! Cant wait!
Oh Mr Waiter! More NPC viewing content please!
Crasy soundtrack
🔥🕉️❤️
This one is such a banger !!!
1:29 did Anyone noticed this Sound? its from Alien: Covenant
в нас таке кожень день в Україні. росія-зло.  Трейлер супер.
Fun franchise, but I just don’t get how they’d win… 😂  Loud speaker + C4 = lots of dead aliens.
scam movie where the original cast?  BS never watch this.
At first glance, I thought the thumbnail is made by AI.  Movie thumbnails are getting weirder than before!
Is she doing white face???
I could see Lupita winning best actress for this!
I am SEATED
I don't like the part 2. Waste of time and money.
Wow such an original idea! Even the first scene is from 28..
russian SU's? does that mean we are gonna see a slight political aspect in the film?
Finally.....😊
Kenyan lady to the world ❤❤lupita🇰🇪🇰🇪
Guys . She has a cat. It's going to be tough for us. The cat gets out alive lest we reck the world. Anxiety through the roof, cat people, all other people assemble.  Period. 0
The aliens had a lot of feasting in the very beginning. Now they are starving 😂
YEAHHHHHHHHHH
A quiet day
I remember when people were angry that the only black guy died in quiet place 2
So they had to introduce black people as main lead🤦‍♀️
Release date ?????
the music like alien covenant
I want this to be a tv show with 10 seasons at least
I enjoyed learning radio frequencies shown the creatures weak spots, then in part 2 shown the creatures can't swim and are able to drown.
I'm looking forward to this!  Also, I wonder if we'll learn whether those things are on Earth of their own volition or whteher they've been used as some form of exterminator for a bigger threat.
Djimon Hounsou!
This kind of movies i love to watch 😮❤
The First Purge Flashbacks 🤦‍♂️
I don't care and this looks like cheap provocation. Time to start talking about this poor content. I'm bored being attacked. It's simply called mobbing.
WHY DID THEY USE ALIEN COVENANT SOUNDTRACK💀😭😭(Jed Kurzel - Medbay)
Looks fantastic
Please not the cat
Really???
They need to stop bringing in cats in horror movies. Now I am only focused on the cat surviving it. I don't care who dies, but not the cat!! 😂
Before happens
Yeah I'm fine if that happens to New York
Не бойтесь это только в америке
Cant waitttttt
No thank you  I prefer the first movie
Got to see this just for the cat. Will it survive the madness? Sure hope so!
Just curious, how are these things able to hear every little sound but not heart beats?
I have always wished to see this movie parts in brutal way
Güzellll😊
Nah. The first two films were brilliant but this looks like yet another "There were too many honkies in the other films so now we'll go black!" rehash retelling of the original story. It'll flop because, shocker, it's not needed and goes to show that Hollywood STILL has way too much money to waste...
A quiet place : Dark Mode
Can’t wait
I can’t wait! But I also can’t wait to see what happens in the future where the last movie left off, unless the plan was to keep a cliffhanger !! Either way, super excited for this one.
It is a production that arouses fear, excitement and curiosity. I highly recommend it to be watched. 1:38
Gayet başarılı bir film şiddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Slavery?
Wow Mark Zuckerberg can really act
Wow Mark Zuckerberg can really act
Put a chick in it, make her black, and lame

Big balls i pooped my padulars & premied to this . Ah bluuur . Must go sit on commode . Code brown emergency 🦺😮blur blur bluuuur sydney Australia 🦘🦘🦘 10/2/2024😂
They put a CAT in this movie... Now I'm wondering if the cat is doing fine until the end of the movie...?😢 It's just feel so bad, after I just lost my cats
Djimon Hounsou? Take my money!!
Trailer doesn't make any sense
I hope that cats survives
YEEEESSSSSSS,
Oh wow trailer spoiler alert 😮😮🎉
merge world war Z
is this 3rd part ?
All the females last a day lol
Loved the first two movies but not watching this one.
my allergic rhinitis will be the death of me 🤧
I wana see day 84
Movies like this only make sense in gun free cities like new york lol. Try that in a small town.
Quite place going Disney way. Remove all original and bring political correct character.... BULLSHT
Big respect to the alien for coming down to earth and making a movie with us human Great acting.
Explosive! 🔥
This cast though!
boycotttttt
i like how they used teh soundtrack "Spores" from Alien: Covenant here. And since that OST is owned by 20th century fox...doesnt that make it copyright?
SU-35 what?why not F18 or F35?
This looks better than the last two garbage movies
Big fan from India
Another netflix black propaganda
Film looks great but Im riddled with anxiety over that cat now please dont hurt the kitty
This is from the book of revelation in the bible when the black pit is opened and demon like locusts flood the earth 😩
This movie be chilling thriller ❤
Looks like a very loud place to me
Another one? Give me a break .
😮
❤
В США население из черных и инвалидов?
Почему все черные?
THE CATTTTT
😅
Where are the characters from the previous parts, or are white ones no longer in fashion?
this movie need series version
Anyone remember Garrador from RE :).
https://youtu.be/aW9UQPaeP2U?si=N28m_26EQbCsfvoW 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
If the cat dies then I riot.
We want Spins!!!
Lupita Nyong'o proves herself worthy of another Oscar nomination. She seems well versed into every role she plays onscreen.
having a cat seems cute but a bit counter-productive in that environment
looks fye
Why don’t you race swap the monsters into black people too?
Same old  stupid aliens....dont frighten us anymore.....
when dis?
This is the movie I want to see
whats up with Hollywood and cats, gosh I hate them, more of a dog person.
This def giving me cloverfield vibes and I’m here for it!
😍🥳 Lupita!!! "I can't wait"
Of course a box ticker is the main character 🤦‍♀️ #wokeathon
imagine if someone has to sneeze
Am start being quiet after watching trailer
"A quiet diverse place"
VERY SCARY TRAILER MOVIE
Wow wow wow  👌 👏  my favourite favourite movie 😍
Using clips from the original movie for this trailer in order to make audiences think those from the original movie are part of this is true marketing.
I was looking for joseph quinn ,is he there?
Thank you. Not a reboot, not a remake movie.🔥
Yaasssssssss ... Finally we got to know where those fukin  creatures came from
The first one was overrated imo (preferred a quiet place) second felt like an Average episode of walking dead, so not holding much hope on this...
Milking it for all its worth
Finally. Someone cancels culture
This will drag me to cinema after a long time since covid time, look forward to this 👍
Zombji,?
That cat better survive.
So what happen to the cat
Harika bir film😊
Ganda
Waiting for Tamil dubbed trailer 🎉
That cat better survive by the end!
the cat better be still alive by the end of it all
I am all in it for the cat 🥹
Omayggggaaatttttt
I still need watch the second one
What’s up with the Alien: Covenant spooky noise?
Wohooo! This is gonna be fire! Didn't know Mark Zuckerberg is also in the movie 0:55!😂
Where her kitty go
Kilian Murphy
Wasn’t there already a movie like this?
Harika
More predictive programming.
Black women as lead character , what a joke😅😅
I hope the cat stays alive
Yaz! 🎉
Dios nunca te pido nada, pero que no le pase nada malo al Michi 😢
I'll be sneezing with those white things on my face
How they fart 🌚 if they fart noisey monster will come then how 🌚
Let's goo!!
Bad time to have allergies.
"Discover why..." I'm fine, thanks!! :D
Looks mustard!!!
Finally a new great movie to watch I hope this wont be a total disappointment
Lupita is just the best
Whoa.😮This looks so intense. I didn’t even think there was a lot of those aliens in the beginning. No wonder there were so many small groups of people by the time in the first two movies.😢
hope this prequel won't fail me.
anyone else worried about the cat?
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooh....
If the cat dies I am not gonna watch
Now we just gotta wait. Oh, goody.
Looking forward to fumbling with my packet of revels during this
Take....MY.....MONEY!!!!!
I always wonder why there isn't a movie talking about what will happen to pets in apocalypse. Finally one.  Shout down to Lupita, she was going through all those choases but still had her cat alive. Definitely a must-watch for me
Just woow
Wowww
Is the next film called, A Quiet Place: The Birth of Jesus?
I saw 471 day and day one 2 years ago, what’s the reason to go again ….
Wow 😎
woke
Maybe they'll make an attempt to explain how a few animals take out the entire planet with all our technology, or they'll just say 'aliens'.
Was that Cillian Murphy at the start of the trailer?
But why not the main characters , this will be just a new pov of the event. I want that family  back again in action........😮‍💨😮‍💨
i love the emulation of the original alien trailer in this trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ5lPt9edzQ&ab_channel=RottenTomatoesTrailers
❤❤❤❤
Something's telling me that Lupita is gonna DELIVER honey
wow
Does the movie say  Aliens do not like a noise😂
OK, I'm down for this!
I bet the cat was eaten by those monsters :(
The first movie was mind blowing
They cast the right black actors to be in a quiet place Dijmon and Lupita, cause if they cast Tiffany haddish and  Kevin hart this movie would be five minutes long 🤷🏾‍♂️
theres gotta be more deeper story to the alien race im starting to get bored
They gonna milk this "quiet place" I can see quiet place day 1,006 now.....sheesh!
Is this the origin story where all this began?
I hope nothing happens to the cat 😅
Great casting!
Bro,did i heard a supra???insted of the creatures sound??😂😂😂
WE ALL ALREADY KNOW THIS WILL BE ❤️‍🔥💯
Fabbb 🎉cantwait
the quiet place more like the quiet world 😢😢😢😢
No original ideas anymore?
Haven't been exited about  a movie in a long time.  I'm actually looking forward to this movie
Thanx for ruined the saga searching make more money. A..Holes
Don't you dare hurt that cat.
Bumboxlaaaaaattttt
Ya for sure there must be "not white people" que mierda de verdad tenían que ponerlos de color
🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
I have been waiting for this.No one believed me but I did.🥹
One of the few times lately where I'm excited to see them expand on a concept. I don't mind if they keep making movies for this universe
Nah
The cat!!!! I hope he survives!
it has potential
very nice
Legend❤
Where is this movie playing on ?
This was a very effective trailer.
Now, this is interesting! June seems too far..
Please, i hope the cat survives!
The cat better live or Im walking out
So they've replaced the white people in yet another movie
Im gonna cry if somethinv bad happen to that cat 😭
Oh no YOU didn’t Lupita! You are becoming my favorite actress for horror/ suspense! The trailer is looking amazing!! 🥰
now we go back? this B.S.
I Expect that Old Characters Its really disappointing I have No More Hype for this 😢
She dies. There you go
1st Part was my Favoruite movie ❤
its like lizard people ou right the elections are coming
Looks awesome. I can see it expanding.
this is giving the first purge. love it
THIS is what I beg more production studios do. Sometimes I wanna see the prequels as their "sequels". So many great series out there that likely would've done better had they thought of showing us events leading up to what we know currently.
I really hope Krazinski directed this otherwise it's gonna suck.
Yeah the average disaster movie, will we have a new high fantasy non-woke movie as only Peter Jackson can do it one day ?  I doubt it
Interesting trailer 😅...  Everybody in Kenya we shall watch h this 😂😂😂
This cat better survive
Any malayali?😂
Blacks
Finally my brotha Djimon Hounsou getting the role he deserves!
I'm so excited to see lupita in this movie, she's such a great actress
_Season 3, Episode 1._  _"What if... Nakia & Korath had to survive an alien invasion together?"_
LUPITA❤❤❤
കേരള ഫാൻസ്‌ വെയ്റ്റിംഗ് ❤❤🔥
just mew
What if I can't hold my fart?
YESS
Can’t wait to see this.
YES I WAS JUST THINKIGN ABOUT THEM MAKING ANOTHER MOVIE
I hope the cat survives!!!
Has some similarities to the chaotic opening scene of war of the worlds
Grioders with bulging eyes is so dumb
🔥🔥🔥
This seriously looks too insane. Can"t wait
This is a must watch for me. Ideally on Apple Vision Pro 😂 If I won the lottery😢
Wow the anger is really depicted accurately
wait was that guy the one in 28 weeks later?
The 1st movie deserves an Oscar for Directing, Acting (Blunt- Bathtub scene), Original Screenplay, etc…. We all know that its one of the best horror film. And Oscars always snub Sci-fi horror genre. So i hope that this 3rd installment will be given a chance.
Looked badasss
I dunno ... this might be the first miss
I can’t wait to watch it
that cat will 100% break my heart, I can already see it
why are they remaking movies, but putting black people in them?
we seen the country side of things, now we get to see how it went down in the city. excited
i like the sound design.
THIS is how real trailers get numbers 💯 you can tell fake & fan made trailers by how many views they get in a day or 2 or even in 5 mins
Wow......takes place in NYC this time!!! look great!!!
Cloverfield vibes
A Woke Place
A quiet place now with black people.... Oh ok so basically my whole child hood ok... This movie will suck y'all this movie is about  children being seen and not heard y'all my mom told me this my whole childhood and it sucked. Just saved you 2hrs and 20bucks
Movie looks sick
I juts need to know one thing, does the cat live?
Cillian?
I'm an indian and when i see dark skinned actors in Hollywood movies i watch it asap!! They act so well & look badass 🔥 Loved the trailer. Can't wait
Noice
Come ya'll I can't be the only one noticing those crazy sound effects...
Any idea why we see Russian Su-35 jets at 1:01?
ithaan da hollywood😎
1:27 The music in this trailer reminds me a lot of music in Alien Convent
I don't watch black washed movies. Boycott.
is cinema 🚬🗿
This look like Cloverfield 2.0👀😩
Wow didnt expect a 3rd film
I’m scared for the cat 😰
We all have been waiting for this, and I got the feeling it'll be worth the wait
we wuz silent and shieet...
LETS GOOOOOO
I always loved Lupita big respect her!!!
A Quiet Place : Black Edition (we all know how quiet they can be. Let’s see how this goes)
So want to see it… but it won’t be a movie theatre. I’m not about to $60 or more to watch a movie. I’ll wait til it hits home screens. I bought a 30 pack of popcorn for $10. Make it make sense.
June?? But its only February ☹️
but there's a caaat 🥺😭
This trailer gives me Cloverfield vibes would be pretty cool if they were linked together. Cloverfield was an awesome movie never got the true sequel it deserves.
no
Part 1 and 2 🔥🔥👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
2 was enough
Alien attack on the world but first from America once again... American will save the world again at the last.. Alien love to America is never ending love story 😬🤮😁😁
Why do you frequently produce apocalyptic movies I'm tired of watching these kind of movies
Of course 🙄🙄🙄
Lupita Oscars loading 🏆
I was excited for this movie already, but when I saw Joseph Quinn AKA Eddie from stranger things, it made it a lot better.
I CAN'T WAIT 🤔😉
That cat better survive!!!!!
미쳐따 ㄷ ㄷ ㄷㄷ
will go to the movies to see this for sure!
This is how a movie trailer should be done. It gives an idea and makes us excited and curious about the movie.
I dont like movies like this that thought about what they should have done FIRST…last😂. This woulda been 🔥🔥🔥 as the FIRST ONE. i dont wanna spend two hours watching when i KNOW you lose…
Thecwoke version .
Masterpiece
Who asked for this?
It’s a matter of time till it’s connected to the clover field universe lol
if Lupita is in it imma watch it
IM SO HYPED
Wow cool!!! They took teh characters we actually cared about and replaced them with black people!!! Nobody has ever done that to a franchise ever! I wonder if she is from Wakanda like Michone from Walking Dead is too!
THE CAT, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAT?????????? 💔💔💔💔💔💔
Most beautiful actress! - Lupita Nyong'o 🙂
I'd be like.... Hamburger! Cheese Burger! Big Mac! Whooper! Hey, If I'm gonna be ripped apart & eaten.... I'm not gonna make em easy for them!
Not this crap restart again…
As we can see, the owners of the franchise think this "cow" still have milk to be sucked. Hollywood today is only franchises, remakes, love actions and super hero movies today. Sad.
Where is jim halpert
Really i am so hyped up!
If anything happens to that cat I swear they're going to wish it was a quiet place!
Cloverfield?
This movie is ruined if you’ve seen tremors.
They can make 471 sequels!
Average American Invasion Movie😒
1:27 that sound is from alien covenant
I’m currently trying to get over pneumonia. I would be so screwed if this actually happened right now😮‍💨🤣
I Am Legend, Cloverfield, World War Z, War of the Worlds…sigh…we’ve totally seen this movie before…  …AND IT WOILD BE AWESOME TO SEE IT AGAIN! I’m in for this. 💯
Can't wait to see this
I’m gonna laugh if those SU’s in the trailer are defending New York
Have never gotten chills from a trailer. Yes to this.
Can't wait!!!
Not sure if I’m ready for the emotional damage of her losing her cat (they always do in movies like this), but it looks great!
The first two sucked so why a third one?
🔥🔥🔥
Imagine having a pneumonia at that time. 😅😅😅
Ooooowwwweeee !!!!!
Parece ser muito bom mano :)
like the last of us
LUPITA🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
I my goodness..I am waiting for it bebe
Do you have permission to use Jed Kurzel's music for ALIEN COVENANT in this trailer? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFtguJHMUZY
They’ve created a franchise ladies and gentlemen! ❤
A Quiet Place, the BLM remake.
If Djimon Hounsou was not in a movie like this it is not a Hollywood movie😎 He's a Great Actor even on his first movie Blood Diamond💪
I'm watching anything Lupita Nyong'o related
eddie its that you??
Seriosly fake or real this ??
A quiet place without Emily blunt, you trippin
The cat better have survived in the movie!
I mean they kinda showed day 1 in the 2nd movie
Why there's gotta be a pet cat in the movie 😭 and why is it with, who I am assuming is gonna be THE main character for this 😭😭😭
That final scene was always in my imagination with xenomorphs if we one day we get a movie with them in modern cities
if anything happened to that cat so help me :( lol
Still i gotta ask .how are they all over earth I've never heard of a meteor shower hitting every continent before. That aside cant wait to watch it❤❤❤
Its no-fart June again
So this is Day 1 from a different part of the world.
who else is getting Cloverfield vibes from this?
This will be epic. Can’t wait
Why the prometheus music in the background
Part 1 fans assemble here
What does it happend to cute cat that is carried by Lupita? 😅
Perfect movie ❤️👏👏
I guess RIP for all those whose having a cough then, or sneeze, or cold..or love to cracking thumbs
I DID NOT KNOW A 3RD WAS IN THE MAKING!! YESSSSS
Oh no!, they went Hollywood with it.... I really don't care how it happened honestly.
Solo espero que el gatito sobreviva durante toda la película😸
Djimon Hounsou... That guy is Everywhere😮😮
The screaming siren like sound was referencing alien and the took a sound cure from Alien covenant at the end.  Pumped for this film.
Soy yo o cuando muestran la fecha de estreno el sonido es de la película Alien: Covenant?
Disaster movies. Bore. Watch the news recently? How classy Paramount. Keep it up.
and the army can do nothing about this, cool
Looking forward to this, I enjoyed quiet place 1 & 2 and can’t wait to see where this goes.
The only world where true silence might actually a appear. I’m honestly curious about this one.
Aku akan menunggu 🤩 Cuma 🙄 DIIIIAAAMMMMM..... 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
Nice to see Djimon Honsou back!
Tenge tengere tenge tenge
*_I'M IN!_* Wait...shhhhh.
Mutombo
Lol. No.
🤣🤣🤣 I love this series.   The idea of aliens or whatever telling earth to S T F U. Is hilarious to me
Now we get to see how Djimon made it to the Island.
Looks sick af
1:27 is that sound from prometheus?
Oh F yeah!
They had to find a way to make it woke. They just had to put a black female lead.  South park was right
the origin!!!
Tv Show next.. hopefully
A quiet place is doing infinitely better with its franchise lore expansion, then whatever the fck the Cloverfield franchise is doing lol
They should just make it into a show. Showing different points of views from around the world. This thing could be never ending.
This is the pre sequel 😢 😮
nothing better happen to that cat
These aliens are violent karens in aggressive noise complains.
id choke on water like an absolute pylon and get killed pretty quickly
Alien Covenant music
Cant wait
I hope the cat makes it!
Oh Lupita I sense another Oscar
Please not the cat 😭😭
I cannot wait!!!!!
this is what i call, a movie.
Is the cat okay?
Wow I'm excited
Cillian Murphy?!   That's him, right? I can't fully remember, but the scene looked like from his own zombie movie
Looks ok. But how much more can you do with this story? We get it,  be quiet. The monsters will hear.
I don’t know. I can’t find these aliens frightening anymore.
More DEI? Nah thanks
Tarantulas, yeahhh I can’t watch that😅😅😅
Yay Djimon!!
I DON'T WANT THIS FRANCHISE TO END
Holy shi--
Looks boring
AL GATO NO PUEDE PASARLE NADA
Fudge I must really watch this on full screen!
My only wish is the cat survives ♥️
Quick! The first two were too white!!! We need to DEI It up!!!!!!!!!!!!
A Quiet Place: DEI Version.
🤯🤯🤯💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
Hope the cat makes it
EDDIE!
you're telling me they're gonna have over 400 movies made about this?
Whoever edited this trailer together...give that person a raise...
At the end of the trailer my words  "OH YES"  Gotta see
Reminds me of the prometheus trailer with that repeated screaming sound.
Much noise for a film about silence.
That's why they goes quiet real fast, they're to many.
Day 1???  I thought the first one was day one?  They should of call this "Pre-Day"
ONLY in theatres. until it's not.
I'm super excited for this!
Can’t wait 🎉
Not going to lie I’m liking what I see
Now, THIS I might watch.
The cat better live.
This should be released the very first time 😑
lol. ok.
This is the right Direction
What a franchise. & surprise to see a third instalment coming out!
❤
Wow they really did white face?
Eddie Munson gonna use the power of music to save the world
Looks like an AI generated poster
I LOVE seeing a movie where you get to watch the apocalypse unfold. So crazy to see
Of course black people 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 That silly Hollywood
Wasn’t the black dude in the end of trailer with her white face on in the other movie????? How does he tie in to the story now????
Cringe a thon
please don't harm the cat😾
talk about whiteface
Would like to see a South Korea version.
FINALLY HOLLYWOOD A MOVIE I ACTUALLY WANNA WATCH.
Or..."A Quiet Place In The City"
Finally the movie I've been waiting for I hope this will answer some questions about the aliens like where they came from, why they landed on earth etc.
The cat 😞
I love the choice of actors.
Looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥can’t wait !🎥🎥📺🙏🏻
Am I the only one that noticed the reuse of the alien covenant spores theme?
Seeing cillian murphy here reminds me of 28 days later
I just see the cat chilling right there
It sounds like Mother from the series Raised by Wolves😮
Al parecer está estará más entretenida
Oscar for sure ❤
Seems like the safest places are libraries
oh wow!
As someone living in NYC, I gotta see this in manhattan hahaha
01:25 this sound is clearly from Alien: Covenant (2017)
This is the best prequel time of the quiet place man
Djimon and Lupita ? Whoa😮
nothing better happen to that cat . lol
Without the first actors I don't see it...
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAT!!!!! 🥲
1:20 🦍
yep I’m definitely waiting for the reviews to find out if the cat is dying before I watch this 😩
This look like it’s going to be the best one 🔥
Who the F is joseph Quinn to write his name on the trailer and leave out the great  Djimon Hounsou's name?
These monsters are so cool.  Absurdly strong and fast.  Nearly bulletproof and almost impossible to hide from.
Please, not the cat.
Yep, I would have died the first night...unless snoring was okay
Yessssss!! Probably the only sequels that I ever genuinely loved!
Oh Lawd yes! Can’t wait to see this❤
Great more browning of cinema I just can't wait, what a joke
I'm going to need to know the cat's alright before I watch this movie.
so relieved they decided to show us the monster is not from this earth
I wonder if aliens have movies about humans taking over their planets..
Can't wait
I love this movie soo ducking much
Oh Mr Quinn looks like he’s gonna ACT
Ffffffffffffffffffkkkkkkkk
Looks like more action than all two movies combined
I never understand why people like this movie? Just because someone is mute, doesn't mean they can't make noises. Or does vocal noises is what attract the monsters? Who KNOWS!
I CAN'T WAIT!
I’m watching this for sureeeeee
Waiting 🔥
Please make it rated R
Why are there russian fighter jets when it takes place in nyc
If anything happens to that cat, i’m suing
Was waiting for a film like this to come out congratulations
Alien covenant used that soundtrack of spores... And this movie looks boring 🪴
In theater not on Netflix? Great!
The sound is similar to ALIEN franchise.
Chronic dry cough could be fatal.
I hope the cute cat survives
The cat🥺🥺🥺🥺
I cannot wait for this def gonna tell my parents they loved both of the movies
this is seriously uniquely interesting!!!!
¿Hasta cuándo Hollywood dejará de usar efectos increscendo y percusiones en sus trailers? YA ABURRE.
I am so glad they’re basically making a universe out of this series! So much potential to add new characters and new stories. So many countries and cities to explore at and after first contact.
This is going to be epic.
Cast looks stellar
Impactante
Feels like the 28... later series. Under the radar first movie that does great, only to get bigger budgets after
a quiet place is def a top 5 modern sci fi classic, this looks great in everyway possible
Loved the 1st one ☝🏽 didn’t care for the second but I’m loving how this one looks !
I'm not mad about a presequel, ngl
1:25 doesn't it sound like Alien Covenant film soundtrack ???
Wowwww❤❤❤
In!
8000 years of evolutionary dominance... went out quietly......🤫
Not the guy with the Huge nostrils again.. 🐽😂
YUCK
Yes PLEASE!!!!!!
I’m sorry, I know it’s a movie, but I just can’t accept that these aliens would win in the end 😂😂. There’s no way.
Love this series of movies. Will be watching in time.
Still giving me chill all the time
Looks RAPID. I like.
If the cat dies, I’m done.
Are those death Angels ?
Frankly, I don't trust Hollywood these days.  Will wait until trusted reviewers like the drinker have their say.  My first impression of the trailer hints at white men getting killed every time, while the diverse people do not.  Hope I'm wrong because the first 2 movies were great.
Very angry that I can’t watch Lupita pop off because you decided to include a cat. Too sad. Can’t do it.
i'm already so worried for the cat 😭
This looks like the best quiet place…ok! i’ll have a movie party with my best friends. Can't wait!
Littele bit curious, but not hyped. Quiet place is powerfull because it's mostly intimate.
Best birthday gift ever
If the cat dies I’m leaving the theater
This franchise is doing it right
We need this in seasons and episodes 🙏enough with the singles
Yesssss❤
Quiet world… soon 😔
Finally, I loved the first two movies and can't wait to see this. I love Emily Blunt and John Krasinski and can't wait for the series to be continued with new actors.
A quite place DEI edition.
THIS IS THE MOVIE I WAS WAITING FOR!!
The siren before the screams  remind me a lot in alien
Ofc they had to bring some forced "diversity"
war of the worlds 2
ai cover
Nice it’s now a diversity movie. Way to ruin it.
This is gonna be great!
😢😢😢
Ada lanjutannya kh. Atau ini awal mulanya
Bruh there is a scene idk if it’s made by paramount but it shows a girl running under an arch during the nighttime and a death angel is ripunning behind her and it’s the creepiest thing ever.
Another woke disaster.
I love how it gives the "Duty after school"" vibes.
these movies are so stupid
Look, I just need the cat to be okay. I don't care about anything else but let the cat be okay by the end of it.
Wasn't the first one also Day One?
Hope we get see different types of the creatures this time
Poor cat 😢
This looks like a scary prequel
If u watched the 2nd Quiet Place the guy shes on the play wit tells the story of there being a bunch of boats but ppl panicked and only 2 left cnt wait to c how this turns out
YES!
Two days late...
Ok! Movies might just be back! Looks #epic  Cant wait to have the theater experience!
RUSSIAN KNIGHTS 🇷🇺 1:01
So we're doing this again......OK.
This is about to be fire
The franchise is getting repetitive. The first installment is still the best and realistic. This directors are so obsessed with raking money and prequels are always nonsense. Something tells me this one won't be any different.
Finally something to look forward to!
Dammit, well now I want to make sure the kitty gets through okay.
Those things aren't scary
First was awesome!!! Second was awful though, because the big star JKrasinsky thought he could do it without paying the writers, but turns out he couldnt!! The rules of the world got forgotten, everyone was making noise the whole time!! Also dumb to focus on a side quest character instead of the mum... Bad storytelling. Bad writing. Bad movie.  Lets see how they do on the third instalment. I hope to love it. But the moral of QP part 2 is pay your writers!!! Don't try to take all the glory and do it all yourself because the result will be shabby🤞🤞🤞
This is how people of ghaza live
Which franchise is this?  Cloverfield?  The Tomorrow War? They all look the same to me 😅
The blood diamond guy 😊
This is what trailer should be, not like other spoiling everything in 2-3 minutes. I'm so excited for this movie and I can't wait...
Yes. I'll quietly wait till June, to make the loudest noise I can. This franchise has been one of the best I've enjoyed in recent years
I think this will be better than the first two.
I am so excited!!! I love the quite place and origin type movies i can not to watch this!!!!
I was looking for the first movie on Netflix,but they took it down.I can't wait to watch it in the theaters.
Can't wait for a  A Quiet Place day 100000000 movie
I'd rather than have had John Krasinski and Emily Blunt back as the leads tbh.
Why are they trying to make this thing a franchise? First one was fun but second was mediocre at best.
wowwww this is what I was waiting for long time since i watched this quiet place movie, and i was thinking about it's next part to be released soon and now am so excited for it,i wish how great it would be if this this movie would have been made in series, i love to experience it's fear while watching such movies or series,birdbox and quiet place will be always my favourite movies..........😊
Wouldn't they always be attacking each other?  They make a huge amount of noise crashing through everything.
It's looking great. I always wanted to see it from other points of view
Kind of unoriginal?!
Quiet Place? Take my money.
Why does the soundtrack feels ripped off by Alien Covenant - Med Bay sequence? 😮
This is not woke enough for me to watch, why are there white characters in the movie? Duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I hope the cat makes it
🇰🇪🇰🇪lupita Nyongo...🔥
Djimon back??! 😮
I CANT WAIT!!! i love this story and I love Lupita❤
Did anyone catch the Alien Coveneant reference? I'm so excited!!!
How a trailer should be made. Barely reveals anything and leaves the audience intrigued.
Sound engineering will make this movie a masterpiece. It looks great enough to go to the theatre for
This one seems not so boring to watch. Definitely going to watch this.
Why I just remembered the bird box
Chills!! 😢
Its crazy how so many asteroids just crash into earth and produced those creatures
That cat isn’t in the room with them at the end - I got a bad feeling about this.
The quiet place was the most consistent and amazing horror films of my generation. Each film so far had a different mood to it , first was father saving family and how they adapted to situations. Second was survival/mentor and a girl film and the next one gonna show total panic after alien invasion. If it's gonna keep up with quality it could be the best horror film of the decade. I'm in
This movie is going to be CRAZY.
literal chills all the way through the trailer, this is what i signed up for, lupita and joseph quinn in one fil
just some more Predictive programming
I have no interest in this series, but I'll watch this one because of Lupita!! That woman can do no wrong!!!
Russian flanker and alien covenant right ?
I can't wait
Same old same old
I'm here for it!
The only way to survive this movie universe is to be a cat because cats are light on their feet and they are quiet unless fighting or meowing
I won’t be able to watch this movie for the sole reason of there being a cat in the beginning and five shots later there is no cat.   I’m sure the movie is going to be great besides that though!  One like equals one pet prayer in the Quiet Place Universe.   #SaveThePets
Lupita doing white face
Why does this story follow dumbasses who live in the city? Like the most unprepared of all of us. They literally have to buy groceries every three days because their food stock is so limited.  It would be Ike watching a football game of a pee wee vs a pro team…lol.
That was a stampede of monsters not just a few of them like the other movies but a full on stampeded, how many of those things came down to earth 0.0
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😭😭😭
Get this John Krasinski is James Wan A Quiet Place 1 & 2 are The Conjuring 1 & 2 And this movie is the equivalent of Annabelle and The Nun... Mediocre product without the clever vision of its original director... And overall a forgettable underperformer at box office
strong black lesbian woman?
Yeeeeessss!!!!
Aquí estoy por Joseph Quinn ❤
10 foot Aliens from Miami??
The sound when the title card appears reminds me of Alien Covenant. Can't wait to watch this, Part One and Two were great.
I thought it already showed how the monster got there during the boys baseball game..??
I will not watch if something happens to the cat btw.
Woke nonsense
I havent seen these movies. Will it ruin it if i watch 3 -> 1 -> 2?
We fart in our sleep, there’s no way to stop it, they’d get us all eventually
excited ❤
What happens when they fart
They really milking this series aren't they.
The two most stupid movies ever made? YOU DECIDE!
why is the poster AI?
LUPITA OMY
How to destroy franchise tutorial👍
Can't wait for this one
If the cat dies, I'm never seeing another film from this franchise.
A Quiet Place is a concept that gets flimsier the more you think about it, so it's really great they're making a third one! Horror is better the more you explain it, as the old saying goes.
of course the new lead is a black NON-FEMININE woman. smdh. well it was a nice ride while it lasted.
I'm definitely watching this movie
Sweet, my most favorite time of an apocalypse is the period of time when everything starts breaking down. Pure chaos and mayhem.
This is probably one of the best movie series ever
deymmmm this Will be the longest sequel ever.....
That’s just terrifying, one minute noise next is complete silence! Can’t wait to be in the theaters to see this
I DON'T LIKE SEQUELS!!!!!!
So scary🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣
0:52 Is that the one actor from Stranger Things S4 whose character died?
Hurry up. I can't wait. Specially about the scene of the subway
Норм , жду
I'm excited for this movie 🎥
i think my fav part is not seeing so much in the trailer. im hungry for this movie 😁
No the way part 3 ?? This is gonna be fun
NOW, THIS is what u call a trailer.
This need more promo. Didn’t know this relase it
.
Duroooo
summ bouta happen to that cat
Love to see Emily ❤...
So... it's like Cloverfield but happening in daylight and with humungus budget. Boring
Predictive programming project blue beam incoming
can we please stop repeating annoying sounds in horror movie trailers?!
Se ve buena la vdd
So, we can have 470 more episodes, I think  385 could be the best or 209. Can't wait
Looks big budget .
I SWEAR IF THE CAT MEOWS😭😭😭
Biology of the creatures never made any sense. And we already saw day 1 in the sequel.  Yawn.
“ 🔥🔥🔥 T R U M P 🔥🔥🔥 “                   This Summer 😂   “ Bigger Summer, Then any Time EVER ‼️”
Djmon Hounsou. Always like his movies.
Wow...they're really milking this now
Expecting a Gripping thriller!
Bruh
This movie has become something so incredible to watch. It's just different. Loved the first, loved the second and this looks super interesting.
Day One
More black people looking scared on screen getting tired of wide eyed black people and I’m black
Really looking forward to seeing Lupita!!
the cat better survive
We going to keep milking this I see... thought we already had a day it all began part... I’m not mad tho... keep em coming!!
lipita nyongogo = no
Interesting and scary at the same time!
Who asked for this ? Milking this boring story with sequels & prequels & adding color doesn't make the plot less boring.
Lupita is amazing. I am sure she would be fine in this film.❤️
Im only here to make sure that cat doesn't become a meal in the movie🥺
Fingers crossed for the cat.
1:27 music from Alien Covenant
Everything has to be black
Well that looks awesome.
Is no one going to talk about the poor cats and dogs and all kinds of pet especially the cat in the lady’s arm
uhuuuuuuuuuu
Didn’t need a prequel
So in love with the fact that she has a kitty cat and in the last scene is running with it in her bag.  😍❤️❤️❤️
Hidden movie trope: Most alien invaders are naked.
Lupita and Djimon?! Yes, mate, sign me up.
This proves that there is too much noise in this world...
Didn't the first movie of quiet place show us how this all began??
A Quiet Place: Spins' Revenge
When???
Crazy visuals and the camara work🔥🔥❤️
imagine the 00;34 scene actually happening in GAZA?? israel is a genocide entity #Free Palestine.
Djimon Hounssou very underrated actor I’m a huge fan
Looks bit similar to War of the Worlds :) not the TV series version.
EDDIE!!!
love the 28 weeks later easter egg
does dijmoun honsou ever age?
Please tell me the cat makes it to the end
Epic 🙌
Not everything needs an origin movie. I think Quiet Place should’ve been left as is
More proof Hollywood can’t come up with original content and has to keep rebranding the same stuff.  Just feels like they are pandering to groups as well.
WTH where’s the og cast at
They literally stole the theme song from Alien: Covenant
Bro why did this have to have a pet in it? Now I have to wait until it after it comes out and if it dies I'm not going to be able to stomach watching it.
Was that Djimon Hounsou again? That dude is such a great actor —so much emotion in his roles. Dude doesn’t get enough recognition.
at first glance i thought this was a trailer for US 2 lol still excited to watch this 🔥
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Hyped for this.
Need some shorts featuring Spins 0:26
I Love it’s “a quiet place.” I can’t wait for this sequel. (Prequel)
I like the movies based on the beginning of the alien invasion
how to destroy a great franchise - guide
RUN IT 🎬💯
Black female lead for the quota. No thanks.
that gave me chills. i will be watching.
NAHHH THIS IS TUFFFF🔥🔥😧
If the cat gets killed I’m walking out and getting my refill and going home
Wasn't there a "quiet place" movie
Yasss! Will be waiting for this one!
I hope they address the issue of how the brilliant minds of our species did not figure out how to fight against those things, but a deaf kid did with her own hearing aid.
I hope the cat survives
A Quiet Place was the best movie of 2018. I've never seen a movie theater packed with people just up and STOP EATING their snacks for fear of making a sound. There was so much thrown out after the movie lol.
Did those Aliens come on the asteroid?
looks like the first Darksiders game intro.
I love how they showed the cat had survived. Show that or I ain't going!
Best movie ❤ Who likes this?
I see walking zombies 🧟‍♀️ scenes in starting??
CANNOT WAIT
Gaye
1:20 Can we discuss what is going on here? I would love to hear your theories!
I do find it ironic the exact thing that makes them so dangerous is the exact thing that can harm them. Without trying to downplay the movies they are without a doubt one of the best original movies in the past decade but I do find it  hard to believe that humanity didn't find out sooner there weakness.
I love the series but I expect this episode to flop. It starts the same way as any other apocalyptic horror movie.
Wooowwww❤❤❤❤Thanksss
I’m sooooooo ready
I can’t wait !
The only thing I care about is that kitty 😭
Ooooooou yeaaaaaa ❤
This was very intense
So this is sequel of a sequel? Or a reboot? Or they back for revenge?🤷🤷🤷
Is it just me or anyone else who noticed how goofey the two who were running in the hospital
Looks mid
The type of horror movie I need in my life🤯😱
I can't wait to watch this 🔥🔥🔥
Snickers
PASS--- Monsters from outer space drawn to sound...   Main character is a black woman and we all know they NEVER SHUT UP
So this is no longer in Emily and John's perspective?
..............
So we're in agreement, if anything happens to the cat we riot?
This looks bad.
Part one gave me the worst nightmares.
Watch the trailer on mute for full immersion
One of the greatest thrillers ever told. Loving the way they’re going about this.. I reckon the next one will definitely be the final chapter where mankind takes back the planet
0:12 So you're telling me about 200 days into this invasion when you KNOW you have to be quiet, these jokers decided to (quietly) make the beast with 2 backs, got pregnant and said, "We'll do the responsible thing and birth the loudest type of human there is that may get our entire family killed"? Okay.
Excited..
Yeah!!! Bring it on❤❤❤❤
Aaaaaand I’m officially done with this series.
Is it just me or cgi is getting worse the more years pass?
LUPITA!!!!
I'll watch this solely because of the best black actors and actresses.
WOW 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Yup def will be watching
Anyone notice how they are using the same/very similar music to alien covenant?
Theyre telling us what they have in store for us...
R.I.P. to the cat
Humans are destroying earth. We don’t need aliens to get the job done
மிகவும் அருமையாகக் இருக்கிறது 👌👌👌
Lupita: It's 'Us'... oh sorry, I'm in 'A Quiet Place!"
How did they defeat the Military?
if the cat dies im suing.
I am ready
I hope the cat makes it
“Independence Day” (1996) looks better than this universe building.
One day or day one?
Basically edge of tomorrow minus the exo skeleton mecha
Sieht langweilig aus
YESSSSS
Here we go.i was wondering when they would get prominent Black people in this.......yawn!!!
The only thing missed was these two to have a movie together, and that just happened. This will be insane!
YED KE
Tauba yaar kya chiz banayi hai main impressed ho gaya isse
the cat... :(
We are at an all time low with movies constantly running out of ideas. Give us something new for once
Why does the thumbnail look AI generated?!
Aliens that don’t like sound. Got it.
Is John karanski in this movie?
We always imagined.. The first few days would have been a massacre of humankind. Now we can see it. 😮
I hope this actually happens so that we become more silent
I cant wait to watch this.. Everything in this trailer was on point and eye catching
Another pathetic attempt at Race swapping!
🤫PSSSSST!
I know I don't have any association with the series, but I am seriously hoping that Day One does a better job than the sequel. And I REALLY hope that it has a better ending than the first.
Whatever happened to standalone movies. Nowadays everything has to be a franchise.
Lupita ? I’m in !
Joseph Quinn in the movie…He chooses his character well
The title is brilliant 😱 I'm going to go watch it even though I'm scared
this cast bro i’m UP
I am deeply offended by the whiteface)
🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://youtu.be/6HpBTFyGdC4?si=Rk4zn9D3tDo-huJg
Hmmm ... I see what they are trying to do here.   I see they intentionally went the route of meeting quotas for this movie with the leads.  It is so obvious now in movies it is disgusting.
I can’t wait for the next sequel, quiet place the first 90 minutes
Love Lupita's role in "Little Monsters", here hoping this movie will achieve greatness like the first one in the franchise. And kudo for kitty for keeping so calm and quiet in the presence of alien monsters LOL. My cat'd just make a ruckus and hightail out of there.
background music straight outa' Alien: Covenant
I’m so excited. But no doubt when I see it, I’ll pee myself
We need a military view from this
next in the franchise A Quiet Place: Day Two
Still don't get how no one figured out that they can't swim and don't like high pitched noises until hundreds of days later, but ya know 🤷
this looks amazing
So excited bruuu
I love Lupita , I judt hope they paid her well. That last white woman got $20 million. They better have paid Lupita the same. Always undercutting black women in Hollywood. It’s terrible
THE CAT BETTER LIVE BRUH
The fact it’s gonna take place in New York which is known for being very noisy was a smart as heck
Seems like Tom Ceuises WAR OF THE WORLDS.
Love the alien invasion type of movies. Specially the ones that try to make it as realistic as possible. Can't wait to watch this movie.
My only wish is for the cat to survive... 😻
I didn't know this
I loved the first movie. The seques was fine, but not necessary. I can get behind this: Focusing on different people during the same event. I'm also a huge fan of Lupita, so I'm in. Hopefully Djimon gets a far better role than what he got in Part 2.
Please let the cat live ❤
Yay Lupita! Can’t wait to see your new film!!❤
Our world is so noisy,  who said it went so silent?🫠🫠🫠🫠
an african story.  not for white people
Can’t wait to work on music again with them in the future.
Wow! This looks much better than the first one, can't wait to see it on Imax.
Djimon Hounsou is in A Quite Place 2 so I bet his playing the same character in A Quiet Place: Day One.
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 quit
If anything happens to the cat I will be mad
It releases on Markiplier's birthday! neat
A mí, lo que MÁS me importa es saber si el gato de Lupita  sobrevive y llega sano y a salvo al final de la película!!!!
Right up my sci-fi street
Alien trailer ... Still been reused since 1979 ..
oh no!! she has a cat!! :(
this is smart. a prequel.
Remember Repent. John 14:6 ❤️
They already did day 1 in the beginning of the second film with characters we cared about. Pass!
This gives i am legend vibes
so long as it's better than the 2nd one
This franchise just gets bigger and bigger and I love it!!!
i don’t wanna wait til june 😭🤣
FRANCHISE EVRYTHING! MILK EVERY PENNY! GLUWWAAAAUUUURGH!
1:00 - что там делают 4 РОССИЙСКИХ СУ-30 явно кадры с авиашоу МАКС!!!
I simply must see this for no other reason than there is an absolutely adorable kitty cat in this!
That cat better live I stg 😭
Cool trilogy
*A MUST SEE MOVIE 👍🏿👍🏿*
Djimon Hounsou makes every movie he's in better.  This looks awesome.
Why would the guy grab her under the car?
...... Did she just do white face?
Everything is blue and orange.
Im in.
Black people 😂😂😂
Looks great, I can’t wait for A Quiet Place: Asian Protagonist sequel
Nice
I’m excited!!
They can literally turn this world into a TWD like series if they want, hope we see more movies with different characters
🙀😿
Another one hun
I don’t mess with cats but that cat better be alive after the movie ends!
I love how movies like Quiet Place and Bird Box explore different locations and people during the event it really keeps things more exciting and thrilling
This is the movie I didn't know I was waiting for
I just don’t think we needed anything more than the 1st movie.. but money tho
Nice! And we wait for World War Z 2 or something like this.
I hate prequels.  Just conclude the actual story.
That cat better live
Why in the world there is a piece of Alien: Covenant soundtrack?
I NEED THIS NOW?!? can i have it
Yes! Love this.
This looks cool, i hope the cat makes it to the end of the movie
They are using ALIEN COVENANT OST ? Why it’s so weird that movie uses other soundtracks now
Vov süper olmuş
Akhirnya yang ditunggu-tunggu🎉
Oooh I always love this day one apocalypse concept. Can’t wait 😮
Now that looks how you do a prequel.
darksiders 1 trailer?
I keep forgetting she’s a Mexican morenita❤️‍🔥🇲🇽 great actress by the way
Yessir🔥
This looks AWESOME
Finally something to be excited about again
New movie?! From quiet 🤫 place movie parts?!?!
Please let me know if the Cat lives! 🥹
Just got excited for a movie for the first time in years.
Why is the russian aerobatic team in here?!
So excited!!
I am excited 😊. But how did they took down those fighter jets,🤨?
Lost me at ONLY IN THEATERS.
🤐😄🤔👏
I love her with her cat
Finally! Another alien invasion flick. Can't wait.
Looks promising
Surround yourself with people that wears two 🦻
I just need that cat to survive!
I am soo excited about this movie
🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
GIVE IT MORE BUDGET FOR BETTER CGI and re-render the scenes !!!
You know what day it is today private ? Judgement day.
John Krasinski deserves flowers
your official website link is effed up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why tf you didnt continued a story from part 2? You basically doing a remake with black cast. I want to see what happens with original characters, you left story unfinished. Finish that, then do whatever you want.
is the cat ok?
Yesssss
Lupita 🎉🎉
YESSSS!!!!!
why there is an alien covenant ost in this trailer ?
Hindi Me V Lawo😢😢
same story but diff place okey okey I'LL WATCH
is it bad that through the whole trailer i was more concerned about her cat than anything else?  they'd better not harm that kitty.
Nooo her cats not in the next scene…I’m already sad
If this happens in reality, my Karen neighbor will be the first victim.
So... Is the cat ok?
If the cat dies I'm not watching!
Such a nice moviee greatttt
Why don't these cretures attack themselves cause they are by far the loudest mfs in these movies man!
i wish they could include studio scene in the movie cuz its sound resistant
Was that a whole arny of them?
Is there only one African American in the frame?!?? Netflix, are you okay?
The cat survive until the end of the thriller ❤🥰
Me van a decir a mí cundo toser (Todos nos morimos)
the cat 😭😭
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Oh sorry!! I sneezed
Looks bad
.
The cat better survive 😭😭😭
Watched both the quiet place movies part 1 and 2 already ...loved them ❤❤eagerly waiting for this one wrapped with thrill and adventure❤😊🎉
All they want is just some peace and quiet.
1:05 why did bro switch teams
Oh, I hope the cat is alright😢
Immigrants invading  USA
YEAHH BUDDYYYYYYY cant wait for this movie
This is chapter 3 and then very very soon there will be chapter 4
I can't wait
I’ll watch it for cillan Murphy
Oh, yeah!😮👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Meteor Garden
That high pitch frequency 😮
So, military downed by Alien? 😮
And they went BLM 💩
A little bit of Alien Covenant music there :D
Anything with Lupita in I'm gonna watch
My only concern is about that cat integrite.
is that girl from Us (horror movie)
Searching for quite place
Sukhoi Su27 Flankers (Russian Jets) Weird? @1:00
But after all, people in the cinema will make noise inside.
film only blecks now )
yo f*ck that dog, you know its going to cause trouble.
Definitely watching that🙃 love that movie.
👍
Nice trailer but where's the main cast from part 1&2? The mother and her children?
the cat better survive
Pretty nice trailer
BE QUIET!!! SHUT UP!!!!  QUIET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's Mel Blanc Speaking, Folks!
Trailer reminded me The silence movie. Looks same .. some unknonw animal attacks where the sound comes from
If anything happens to the cate imma riot
Hopefully there's a sequel.
Why have ears if youre going to be violently sensitive to noise. Even the creatures themselves make noise so why us ?
I still need to see the second one
This looks like an awful cash grab.
Meh, I was hoping for more of Blunt's story, not this popcorn flick.
И это посмотрели 8 млн за один день 😮
I was wondering how they were gonna make a 3rd movie that would pretty much erase white people. Yay again Hollywood.
How many more movies about this can they make? Milk it dry! Modern Hollywood baby!
is this Lupita Nyongo from Kenya??
OMG...I CAN'T WAIT ❤
Did I see Cillian Murphy @ 0:15
This should have been the second movie.
The sound in 1:26 comes from the alien covenant.
My man snores really loud, I don’t think he would make it.
oh no she has a cat😭😭😭 i hope the cat survives
So this ones woke right? 🤣🤣
So great to know this movie will be available on Halloween as well for a marathon with all the other two movies
the cat!!!
.
Yeeees I want!
So glad they got djimon back in this one
This raises my hope of a 3rd movie. I absolutely adore the first 2 movies.
Lol here I am screaming in my living room “ KEEP THAT CAT SAFE!!”
THE NIGHTMARE OF SILENCE
just rewatched the previous ones❤
Lupita Nyong'o.  Joseph Quinn.  Djimon Hounsou.  MEU DEUS, QUE FILME VAI SER ESSE.  Se depender dos atores teremos um filme impecável.
Finally 🔥
The scene where Lupita is watching all the creatures run past in a herd is such a terrifying thought.   Like imagine hiding from that
From A quiet place 1 to 2 I was never disappoint why would this one disappoint I doubt that 😜 am a big fan
I felt the concept a combination of i am legend and cloverfield movie….
Let's be honest. Teachers would do anything for one of these in their classrooms...
Is this like a prequel to the prequel?
The end music theme sounds similar like the Alien Covenant.
https://youtube.com/@Edwinbr0?si=qfCLSccGNdkaIb7o
😮😮offs im wtng😊
Been waiting for this for loong
Never thought Lupita and Djimon would excite me in a sci fi horror thriller.
🔥 can't wait
These creatures are the only things that can save new york city from the over infestation of trash. Should be a great movie
Where can I watch this movie? netflix?????
Wow!
Waiting....
Wait? No mention of a They/Them in the first 30 seconds? The fad is almost gone 😂😂😂😂
oh mother lupita
so this will show how djimon's character got into the island in the second movie
I hope the cat survives. ❤
this is what I always wandered, how it started...great
This looks so legit.
BOYCOTT PARAMOUNT! 🍉 They support the ongoing genocide and occupation of Palestine. DO NOT watch this movie in cinemas.
Wow goosebumps.. it's been a while seeing a TRAILER and wanting more
yes
Just a thought.. ..what in the world could a lady hiding under a car do for me against these things..? Complain..?  That part was weird.. ..however, if one exists, bound to be more..🙃
My birthday!
So first Creed, now this... why aren't black people trying to create their own franchises?
I can't wait
The soundtrack use in the trailer really sound like the alien covenant trailer soundtrack
Woah
WE ALL NEED TO LEARN SIGN LANGUAGE A.S.A.P
Music sounds just like a part from Alien Covenant
oky iam going
Where is my cillian and Emily😢😢😢
Here for Lupita🤙🇰🇪
black mirror
stop making these
ISTG IF THE CAT DIED- BYE
Why don't the monsters also attack each other if they all gallop loudly around making horror noises?
A prequel nice
Petition to ban popcorns in quiet place!
These Sam quiet place movies never fail to keep me entertained
I'm making a film name puujail
Wasn't that Cillian Murphy
JOSEPH QUINN?! WOO HOOO!!
Wow this is gonna be exciting
the cat wehehe ^^^
I like that they have branched off and will be telling stories about the same even from different perspectives.  This is exactly what the book World War Z did but they bastardized the name for the trash movie they put out.
Habang tumatagal lalung gumaganda ang storya nito, nakaka sabik naman
Although i LOVE this. Im all for it. How MANY DAYS of this are  we gonna get? 😅
i love Lupita Nyong'o
woke....... too politically correct
I want you to know that some people pay people to increase the traffic here. That's why the viewership numbers here are not real.😮
Yes please!
so whiteface is ok while blackface is not?) yeah, got it ;D
It's Joseph Quinn ya'll!!!
Didn’t expect a prequel to come out of this franchise,I’m all for it tho🤙🏿🔥🔥
THEEE CATTTTTTTTTTT😢😢
Another woke movie with black people. Does every movie have to have black people in it. Can we have whites in the remake of roots 🤦‍♂️
I knew it, it's similiar to the cloverfield
https://youtu.be/o8NluQaEdVk?si=UGQMJVQjQcAj6ASK
This should happen in future 😁
can't wait:'
Now this is a real movie that we needed, not some Marvel bullshit
This is how you do a trailer!
I'm kinda sad she clearly lost her cat
Bro BGM 🔥🔥❤️ next level 🔥
What happens if have Taco Bell and then you have to fart? Are you dead?
I never could get into these movies. Too far fetched for me.
Now we want Upgrade our civilization 🛡️🗿
Francis got to story'
Why are sukhois flying by?
Lets be honest people, this is going to be a shitshow. This always happens with the sequels, prequels, simply overdoing it. There's no charm here at all.
Eddie from stranger things
Why Wasn't This Released First????
Glad to see Djimon Hounsou back on screen
Did they use the Alien Covenant score?
Why do us like that...seriously why,    if you the story belive me dont bother
Djimon and Lupita on the same movie? this is a dream come true
finally. the flaw in the second movie was that they didn't focus on the prequel aspect. hopefully they don't blow this one too, though of course Krasinski was the strongest suit of the original
The cat tho
yes, wanted more of a horror then thriller :)
Day 1
it is starting to get boring😂
SHEEEEEEEEEEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Wow that's gonna be dope!
Masterpiece loaded ❤❤❤
Did they just steal the sound design from Alien Covenant?
Must watch 😮
hey bu film bi harika.. gerçeklikle yüzleştiğim ender filmlerden birisi...
I will watch it in silence....and will be quite, promise
gerçekten harika bir film gibi gözüküyor.
What city is this. Cape Town?
😊
Demons😑
yooo, I so want to see this
Looks better than the sequel !
Aksiyon sevenler icin guzel film
Love how they keep using the Alien Covenant theme for the Quiet Place trailers!
Only spin-off 😮A quite place parta 3  2025 A quite place without Emily blunt poooorrrrrrrrrr💔
Love it
blud really said 🤫🧏
Lupita ny'ongo ❤
YOOOOO
Bu franchise gittikçe büyüyor ve onu seviyorum!
wahh so long! June 😢
1:00 those look like Su-30s, are we going to be seeing some military action? Like some nations fighting back against the Death Angels? Because the US doesn’t even use Su-30s, we’ll wait and see.  All in all I can’t wait for this movie
Visit us, watch cricketer virat kohli's childhood
Lupita horror QUEEN and we love to see it
ooooo
SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!! Counting down now!
Don't like this comment else notification sound will wake him up💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
This makes me want to watch it more
Really appreciate to having a beginning for a beginning.
Wow wow.. FINALLY!! THE ONE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR DECADES!! IS FINALLY HERE!!
About time. Walking dead should have started this way  too
People working on a smarter world  and will end up with a quieter world!!?🤔🤔🤔
I hope she keeps that cat safe.
The fact that it has sound effects from Alien Covenant got me thinking
Yeeeeeaaah lets make the same film a 3rd time!!! Then a forth time, and then a fifth time!!
Lupita is incredible, can’t wait to see it !!
My best movie list ❤❤❤
Love this franchise, can't wait
😲😲
The soundtrack reminds me of alien covenant
No black Americans wanted these roles?
Su h a BS
I think the novelty alone of seeing these creatures invade on a mass scale is enough for me to go see this
This looks awesome
oh no...there's a cat...
The way I'm going to be worrying about that cat throughout the entire film...
Yes please
Populer olma yolunda iyi bi fragman
❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm hyped!
That’s that scream from SpongeBob lol
Cloverfield + king kong part 1 vibes
Yes,  yes and yes!
Heyecanla bekliyorum
Nice! Looking forward to this one!
I hope that cat survive in the apocalypse 😢
Why so many blacks in the movies nowadays?
Güzel
so that's why she didn't speak when will slapped chris
Why is the trailer out. But we still need to wait 5 months ?
Aksiyon dolu bir filme benziyor meraka sürüklüyor kesinlikle izleyeceğim❤
That cat BETTER live.
This is the kind of movie I want. Not movies with cute faces. Those movies are fake.
It reminds me the movie silence on Netflix
LUPITA AND DJIMON in a series! I am too amped for this
1:00 four Su-27 Flankers... Nice 🤌
Güzel bir film akıcı heyecanlı izleyebilirsiniz
Gerilim filmi sevenler kaçırmayın bence
Strong black queen, weak beta white male
Aren't those the same sound effects from the last Alien film?
(🔥)*(❤)=❤️‍🔥
That sound at the end reminds me of the alien covenant soundtrack
Already on my list, it's time to dig it up and start watching these.
WOW. I LOVE IT. CAN'T WAIT TO KNOW WHY THE WORLD WENT QUIET.
Süperdi 🎉
Love how the cat gave no fks that the world was ending and was just chilling in the jacket the whole trailer lol
Guzemli bir flim⭐
I only watch it if the cat survives😅
🔥🔥हेलो में यूट्यूब हूं मैं ठीक हूं मेरे से कोई मदद हो सकता है 🔥🔥
😂😂😂 No really, what was that guy expecting her to do? Grabbing her leg yelling "PLEASE! PLEASE! 😂😂😂😂
I seriously cannot wait for this film!
Bu yılın en iyi fragmanı şu ana kadar.
this movie just show how stupid we are in case an alien attack will come upon us 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eminim benim gibi sizinde ilginizi cekecek bir film
the cat's predicament is going to make me cry...
Güzel bir flim olduğu kesin
Im not prepared for the cats death. 😢😢😢
Spins need his own spin off movie 0:28
Aksiyonlar ve betimleme birbirini tamamlamis tavsiye edebilecegim bir film
Cant wait
Gurultulu ve kalabalik sekilde baslayip sessizlige dogru ilerliyor gayet izlemesi keyifli
Heyecan verici kesinlikle izlenmeli
Harika ötesi
QP1 was spellbinding QP2 a luke warm derivative with nothing new to add and yet the dog returns to again chew the same old bone even though the marrow is long gone
efsanelerden!!!
So just change the white people to black. Very original
Wow......takes place in NYC this time!!! look great!!!
please release part 1 and 2 in theaters again like it was planned before covid
I AM INVESTING FOR THISS
Guess having the original family was too white.
We want SPINS!
Silence movie
My franchise! ❤
Thanks for ripping off the primeval future predator and making it a generic alien
Oldukça sürükleyici bir film. Sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum 😊
We want spins! 00:26
Just watched the trailer for 'A Quiet Place: Day One' and I'm already practicing my silence. Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn, if you need someone who's an expert at not making a peep during scary movies, I'm your guy. 🤫🍿
Iyi bir emek harcandigi belli.
Funky!
Severek izliyoruz Biz
Ürkütücü sahneleriyle nefes kesen filmde kısa bir kesit 😮😮😮😮
I am the fan of this movie since first part
So is this a spin-off or prequel??
More woke affirmative action bullshit major pass for me.
I hope the cat survives
The Krasinkis are raking it big time with this IP, no wonder they turned down Marvel.
YesYesyes!!!! My Queen! Yessss
Day by day prove Hollywood no one beat me !! 💥
Awesome! I really wanted to know about how the world reacted to the aliens globally. Excited for this
How they gonna survive that many creature
It's Solomon Vandi.
I'm there baby, I'm there.........................................Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I’m not saying they’re aliens….but they’re aliens.
I really love these kind of movies ✨✨
The amazing of quiet place series save money on sound effects. 😅
I Scared 😲😳😳
lupita in horror movies 🔥🔥
THE CAT BETTER LIVEEE IDCC
My question is how the aliens will defeat the world military forces.
Re-watching Cloverfield might be more entertaining.
I cannot imagine a scenario where you have to survive against hundreds of those things.
Honestly they're fun movies but the idea that these things nearly wiped out humanity before one person thought hey you know how they hunt by sound? They must have super sensitive ears lol
Eagerly waiting😍 🇮🇳
Is Lupita mute in this movie?
Bro this franchise can turn to a series TBH there are so many potential stories to be make.
Shut up Melanie
They haven't missed yet, bringing in huge actors makes this 10x better as well. Can't wait!
Lupita and Djimon, yes please.
she survived that long with a cat ? an animal that doesnt know who to stay quiet and is always doing low reverb sounds so it can be heard long distances....yeah right
Not gonna lie, I legit thought someone was trolling with that thumbnail.  I was like, "why is Dave Chappelle's crackhead character in the new Quiet Place movie?"  Wow
WOW
Take my money
What if you put Hulk on quiet place?
Me aa gya
❤❤
this is the cloverfield series i always wanted
loved the first one loved the second now time for the prequels
The basic premise often missed is that any form of life intelligent enough to come here from another planetary system is far more advanced than we are and would wipe us out effortlessly.
I am actually so excited for this one. The monsters in this film are 👌
Day one of any zombie film/sci-fi horror monster film is always better than 1-3 years later. First day just hits different bruh
Ok but can we talk about the cat?? I didn’t notice it until my 10th time watching the trailer 😆
*”looks great” 👍🏾 - MELL DUNEY 616*
Perfect casting!!
For so long the black community has not had a scream Queen representing them until Lupita was on Us. And now she is on A Quiet Place!????!  The way she shows terror through her eyes is insane, especially in Us.
Poor cat
This look better than the original first too
I have never enjoyed watching a trailer this much. So excited
The only nitpick I have is that we know what happens to Dijmon’s character, and I thought it was quite a waste of the character/disrespectful end, so seeing him pop up here only reminds me of the wasted potential that he will inevitably face.
Does anyone know what thee movies are rated?
This gon be the best one I can feel it
This franchise is one of the best and always has great actors and actresses in it
https://www.youtube.com/@Bhojpuri8862 YouTube creator mix❤bhojpuri new 💯 hindi ♥️ song 🎵
Jim Halpert is killing it🔥
First one was eh and I’m sure this one will be just as boring as the rest of his subpar movies
Waiting anxiously for the day Djimon Housson gets a lead role in a Hollywood movie. He's always supporting. Like ALWAYS. No one wants to give him a shot at lead role
Hope the cat lives too
Can't wait to see it!!
I'm i the only one that thinks Lupita's character can't speak
If the cat dies, I’m out.
In the 2nd movie, we did get to see how it all started. But the fact they now shows a larger population by featuring a bigger crowd of people is even more entertaining. The city never sleeps, and always overcrowded by people with busy activities. There's going to be a lot of carnage and brutality there. I can't wait to see Lupita too.
Can we all agree we'd be screwed if these creatures were judgment day😂 we got to be the loudest mammals on earth😂❤
They have to resort to bot comments to praise the diverse™ cast, I think they're not very confident in the movie.
Was this necessary?  Why aliens making noise don't get attacked by other aliens?
❤❤❤ i just can 't wait
Where is avengers?
If anything happens to that cat, i’m suing 😂😱
Idk seems redundant.
Setting in New York is GENIUS!
First make these social media influenceer quiet 🤐
This is what we wanted  The origin 😅
U better not fart !
This is the bets thing that John has made or apart of now its a bigger franchise and could expand into much more
A Woke Place...
I don’t know about you, but I was heavily gasping by watching the trailer and I realized that I would be Dead already if that really happen to our World 😅
This prequel is gonna awesome 😎
I will be there.🙌
Lupita's eyes are the most effective scary movie tool ever.
1:34 that cat better survive!!
These movies make no sense
❤❤❤❤
Ahhhhh Man! I can’t wait
this gives me cloverfield vibes
The year 2024 and 2025 are genuinely very exciting and beautiful years for movies. Hope they make a comeback in a major way again
Something like that might actually happen sooner than later.
for Bhopal, simple as that
Dhekhte hai india ke liye kon ek like krega

Rajveer Singh youtuber
Of course--they had to go and black-ify it.
https://youtu.be/PvyGsAGdwp8?si=UR1ByFmSf9U6939O
Djimon gets backstory, eh?  I'm in.
This trailer really shows how many aliens were on those meteors
A must watch. I like the first two.
The best part is how the past two movies established how horrifying and overpowered ONE alien is. So even the thought of dozens is a thrilling concept.
The cat dies?  I don’t think I can watch it lol
meow
These aliens are the scariest I’ve ever seen besides Xenomorphs.
Man I love this series
I am poor support please 😭😭😭😭
Ooooooooooooooooo YES!!!!!!!! SO EXCITED!!!!! especially with her in it! Yes!!
This movie is going to be intense
https://www.youtube.com/@rajvlog250🎉🎉🎉🎉😅😮🎉
Mr Fantastic and Sue Storm
When is it coming to theaters
Their not actually making this after how awful the 2nd movie was haha nooo this has to be a joke
JOSEPH QUINN I MISSED U BABY
so in this lore, nggas died first and the white people survived. Got it
is the cat mute
the cat better stay alive
AND OFC IT'S WOC. AND PROBABLY GHYAY LOLOLOL.  ruin everything pls
We want this masterpiece in Hindi please 😊
You know what’s great? To see movies not following the path of others….. this franchise has so much stories to tell. And this is one of them.
looks so stupid dude, maybe ill be proven wrong but i doubt it. all these shill comments make me sick
Did anyone notice the last bit? Crysis music?
fallen angels (demons) fell to earth mated with human humans women created giants now hide among us as demons In human form and now use a.i and high position authority to destroy CHRISTn n sprd satan. Fallen angels fell from heaven to earth mated with human humans and created giants and what does it take to produce an off spring similar genetics or similar species. So there's demons in human form living amongst us these people are in rebellion against Christ you will find some of them as the lgbtq community ,black lives matter, some politicians, rioters,homeless or migrants etc they are meant to lead humans humans towards sin mostly by way of phyops or influence in media then shifting laws like supporting the lgbtq community etc...
🔥🔥🐾🐾
Alien Convenant music copied😡
OHHH MAAAYY GAAADDDD !!
So when is part 3 coming out
so that is where the meteor fall to the City and the Monster start Killing all the people QUIET... This horror movie is evolving..
Are they still using the electric grape 🍇 sound?
The Quiet Place movies are all about eye acting and they always get the perfect actors for that (Emily, Cillian and now Lupita).
ohhh so cannot wait for this!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Id much rather have a sequel to aliens covenant cus i hear the music Lol
Badass
That cat better survive
Movies have been rubbish these last few years ( maybe the batman was ok- though should have been a TV series)... To many cut and paste marvel movies that seem to cartoony....lack of ideas but this seems interesting as well as the fourth planet of the apes movie. fast and furious series- rubbish Transformers series - rubbish Marvel movies post endgame - rubbish Mission impossible series - ego projects Jurassic world series - stealth remakes Disney starwars.... uninspired  DC movies after man of steel.....a mess John wick sequels... giving me a headache
I am SO going to see this movie!!!!!
Fascinating..wonder why they didn't start the series like this
Haven't anticpated a film in a long time. Definitely going to watch this when it comes out. And plus it's showing on my birthday
I was always more interested in a d-day thing like this than an aftermath thing like the other two films
I onew "a quiet place" means not a quiet place
It looks amazing
Theyre not finish milking this movie . Ok
Always wondered what happened to the animsl adoption clinics and the newborn babies in hospitals when this invasion occurred
She is great in Black Panther!
They went from sonic the hedgehog to this? WoW
0:55  is that mark Zuckerberg
Que ansiedad ya quiero que llegue junio,voy el primer dia al cine
Perfeição
Gotta be honest...I spent most of the seconds watching this trailer, hoping the cat made it.
SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!! Counting down now! 🎉❤
Wait a minute!! They used the music/sound effects from Alien: Covenant at the very end of this trailer! 😮 1:25   That’s either a very cheeky rip off, or a hint that these movies are connected?! Surely not… 😧
Lupita & horror movies are a match made in heaven. I just love the way she shows fear on her face! This trailer was epic! Cant wait!
Dats too Noisy for a Quiet Place. And dats dats more like it. 👏🏼👍🏽
Dei crap
Amazing! Looks like we might learn how Dijmon’s character made it to the island? I don’t see them using the same actor for 2 different roles….this looks incredible!
Siuuuuuuu ❤
https://youtube.com/shorts/quNaC_gQSOI?feature=share
https://youtube.com/shorts/quNaC_gQSOI?feature=share
I love the fact how this franchise from a slow paced mystery thriller to a full-blown action horror.. yall in love with YPK22X huh
I will watch just to know what happened to the cat!!!!😮
Seeing just how many there are really makes it easier to process why the military failed.
Hope the cat survive
im hearing alien covenant theme music?😂
A quiet place....full of little cloverfield critters!! 🤣🤣
Can’t wait!!!!!!!!
WHy she has to hold a cat 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I THINK THE MAIN CHARACTER IS MUTE!!!! She can hear everything but survive by her inability to speak.
0:40 RIP all headphone users, including myself
Ik it’s probably not true, but with that way this trailer looks, it makes sense that ppl make theories abt a quite place and cloverfield being connected
It's the cat ❤
DEIA at its best, woke Hollywood.
definitely going to watch this in theater
i knew it was missing a black person
I love how the cat is so chill, while everything is happening. It's like .. yep.
Where is Emili Blunt????
They should have done a continuation from the last movie 😞
I cant believe they are making another one of these. And now they decided to add (diversity and inclusion) GREAT......
😮😮😮😮ca-ra-jo😮😮😮😮
I can't wait !!!!!!!!!!!!!
PROTECT THE KITTY
Only 3 seconds of Joseph 😢
This is how filmmakers should make movies that are related to each other, not just make sequels that become money-making machines, but make movies that are about the movie from the beginning, middle, and end and take the point of view of other characters.
Fino 😎👌
I like that the main character is black ❤ more horror movies with black main characters has been a thing lately that im really digging.
I like horror movies so I wouldn’t mind seeing this one in theaters.🙂
If that cat dies I’m starting a meow boycot in theaters. Everybody meows.
This sounds like the Alien covenant soundtrack
Sooo they’re aliens 🥹🥹🤌🏽 cant wait
That cat better live. Gave me sm anxiety throughout the trailer. 😭😭.
So why is there more of them in this movie
0:02 60 SECONDS REFERENCE
Is it just me or am I the only one hoping nothing bad happens to the cat that she is holding in the beginning of the trailer
We need more "spins" in this stuff.  Dude is the straight up MVP of this trailer.
Super cringe and super forced. Pathetic trailer.
Hope nothing happens to that cat 🥺🐱
If Joseph dies I’m crying.
Just milking the sequels I see
its gonna be epic, cant wait!❤
Yes finally a movie in NYC I wanted a zombie apocalypse but I'll settle for this...let's GO!!!
ah yes, you can stop someone coughing from just putting your hand over their mouth and the person will be perfectly fine.
Yes yes yes
This day one stuff is always the best part. Fear the Walking Dead is an example of not realizing this.
HOLY COW 😱 CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS ONE 😍
😃
Hey look, another, "the world's gonna end!" movie and the destruction of humanity.  We haven't had a new one of those miserable films ini how many months?
They picked the nosiest place on earth for this movie
Please tell me the cat survives
0:52 Call me crazy but I thought the girl was covering her cat's mouth 😂😂😂😂
I have never been so excited for a horror movie prequel in my life! A Quiet Place (1 and 2) are my favorite horror movies of all time and I have been eagerly awaiting this trailers arrival since Day 1 was announced to have been given the green light. I had the biggest grin on my face while watching this trailer!
https://youtube.com/shorts/WQe2Bi-Scec?si=vJP4Q2HHlVHVGEH9
A Quiet Place in 2018 A Quiet Place in 2020/2021 A Quiet Place Day One in 2024 I was a child when the first movie and now a teenager for the second movie and a prequel to this there was a spin off third film but thats a new generation so yeah.
Isn't that the guy from the second film who gets killed
Hard to believe any sort of missiles, like from the F16's at 1:00, wouldn't phase the creatures. Bullets, sure not as surprising, but missiles and bombs?
Quiet Place + Lupita + Djimon = YES
Too woke for my liking
If this really happen to our world will be awesome.....
Why is it have to be backward sequels these days?
The cat… the cat better make it… or at least take an alien out going down! I’m excited for this next one
Hard core fan of this movie ❤
A Woke Place?
is this cloverfield childrens?
Terrific trailer, waiting to watch the movie 🍿
Apa hanya gw yg orang Indo disini gaesss...???
What happens if you fart?
That cat does one “meow” and it’s ggs fr
Do we even need this? AQP 1 seemed like it was best left as a one-off piece.  Since when were there a full cluster of meteors? There was only ever one showed before.
¡Que no muera el personaje de Joseph Quinn por favor !🙏 Me encanta este hombre 😍
WOW! Lupita Nyongo is completely transforms herself into every role, I am excited to see this just for her
this looks terrifying, im so excited
love lupita so much
Can't wait to watch! 🎬🤩
Wow...
https://youtube.com/shorts/yE_hylxppJE?si=KZ-X_0lxiHo5La6Z
Do we need this film? It's just an exercise in cinematic rubber-neckin'. And wasn't Cloverfield exactly this? A Quiet Place should have been a brilliant, one off, hermetically sealed, open-ended, standalone.
Russian su-27 spotted haha, must be a mistake  1:01
So it's the Cloverfield black woman version
If the cat dies I'mma throw a fit
Yet another prequel.
❤❤❤
Who else here is so excited to see comments about [insert name of actor]? Isn't [insert name of actor] the best? So scary!
Never got in to this franchise at all.
It was only a matter of time before they shoe-horned [sreggin] into this series. Hard pass.
My papa and I used to rewatch this movie all the time. 🙌🏻🔥 And last September 2023, my papa has gone. 💔  I hope we’ll watch this sequel together. 😭😭
im going to riot if that cat dies
Gives me Cloverfield Vibes AND I LOVE IT
so they were filming in gaza or wha?
I'm going to see it, but I'm seriously worried about the Cat!
You can already tell Lupita is going to nail this role!
Seems death stranding
All I care about is if they explain how and why the creatures came to earth if they don’t I’m going to be upset lol.
Africans would survive. I'm in.
I'm a simple man I see lupita i click 😂
Cant wait. Looks awesome
Ooh. I cant wait to be quiet 🤫🤐
Nonsense with a lot of noise. Zero ANYTHING new. Who film these movies?
I always wanted to know how it all started. I knew it was coming. Can't wait to see it.
spooky season in june yes pls
looks like the wok'd this up too , hard pass!
I’m all in, love the first two movies
Gee I wonder what will happen to the cat 🙄
The idea of ​​the Film is incomparable; The cast is wonderful; thank you for the film!!!
well, maybe I should lower my expectation..
Epic, but can't help but notice when the movie title displayed at the end it is the same sound that is in some scenes in Alien Covenant. Y'all get permission to use it like that?
This feels like Cloverfield. That's not a bad thing.
Hear…me out: Birdbox meets A Quiet Place. Do you…see it.  Aliens fight each other for dominance as they snack on us.
Can't wait to see another part of my fav horror movie
THERES A CAT 😭
Do we really need a day one 🤦🏿
Franchise has a sort of Alien path to it. From horror to action horror. Not mad
Oh there's a cat in it. The moment they involve animals I'm out.
❤‍🔥💯
2024
Finally, another movie for those with social anxiety!  #bequiet😁
I really hope the cat survives.
She had. a cat and then she didn't. it better not be dead
Sounds like Transformers 😂
Name a better movie to be a TV show I’ll wait
DEI bleh
Lolywood and its quotas :D .
Is this quite place is related to the old one???
Ffs these movies suck
Seria bueno un súper man en esa peli, un criptoniano muy ocupado y enojado😅
Djimon Hounsou is an amazing actor. I'm glad lupita is getting big roles too.
I dont want this to end. Each one is getting better and better
Finally, a proper disaster movie.
Glad to see our own lupita again this is going to be an amaizing one
I can not expect..🌚
... but if he dies AGAIN ...
All I care about in this trailer is the cat 🐈
i havent been excited to see a movie since halloween 2018 came out
They should’ve made a hbo series of this
I’ll just wait for it on paramount +
I will lose it if something happens to that 🐈
What happened to the kitty?😿
Don't understand why blacks get a version of their own in Hollywood for no reason, it's like Hollywood is trying hard to represent them and overdoing it for fear being tagged as white biased.. Because if they do so should Asians and middle easterns have a version of their own.
The back place
ラストオブアスの様に今までの日常が突如崩れていく終焉系の映画はめっちゃ好き
Soooooo exxxxxxxciteeeddd
Looks scary AF! I can't wait!!! Nakupenda Lupita!!!
A quiet place, day black.
Well I’m looking forward to this
1:27min Soundeffect from alien covenant😮
https://youtube.com/shorts/VgXCfvWRFsQ?si=KDmEXHrWF2QlZeo9
This looks AMAZING!  The first two films were fantastic!  The first film should have been dripping with Oscar’s!
Looking awesome!
Imavine fk breathing in the wrong tone and waking up a giant horde of monsters 17KM away,making them go at your location like maniacs.   Just,
If that's the main character pass 😂😂😂
We here for it
You got to be kidding this is not a third movie 😡😡 and Emily blunt is not back
1:27 Prometheus/Alien Covenant
Nothing better happen to her cat or else 😡
😴
W for mute people
Has everyone notice the song😮 is similar to Scott Ripley's Alien and Prometheus.
Rip to all the people in the bathroom's with explosive stomachs lol!
Oh no please don’t tell me there’s gonna be a cat in this movie they have to protect
That cat better live!
DOOMSDAY
I recognise some of the music form Alien Covenant
This franchise just gets bigger and bigger and I love it!!!
Here's my problem with all these movies... We have a full infrastructure, Colleges. Space Programs and we've only gotten to the moon. Still you're telling me a group of non-communicative creatures have concurred space travel before learning how to use doorknobs...
That kitty is gonna get eaten...
Amo essa saga❤
More diverse trash.
yessss 🎉 been waiting 🥲
When will Hollywood allow Djimon Hounsou to be a lead in a blockbuster film? They owe him that much, big time. I've known him since Amistad and Gladiator.
Please don’t hurt the cat
🤍Lupita
Ok this guy needs a new idea, stop making sequels just because 1 worked.

Don't Fart.
1:27 is this gonna be part of the Alien franchise?
We want Spins!
So glad she's getting lead roles. She deserves the success.
I love the atmosphere of the film, and I'm happy to see Djimmon again.😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lupita is such a powerhouse actress
That cat better make it to the end!
Make lame, make it … you know the rest.
Headphone cause it so intense
1:27 This soundtrack is for the Alien Covenant movie 🤔 am I wrong?
They didn't really rip off Alien with this trailer...Did they? That's ridiculous man.
Am I the only one who thought I heard the Alien Covenant soundtrack?
I don't know if anyone else has pointed this out yet, but I've watched this trailer a few times but almost missed this. Look at 0:54. Top right corner on the building. This scene is going to be so crazy. The streets are flooded with nothing but people.
Why no hispanic actors?
when my mom told me about a threequel for my favorite movie was coming out this year I was absolutely engulfed in joy oml this is exciting
Legit had this trailer on repeat!
This concept is so dumb... If all they hit blindly is noises, then set traps using noises that's it,,, Run a shredder, place a music player in front of a land mine, and so on and so on... An utterly dumb concept....

It has the Prometheus and Spores from the  Alien Covenant soundtrack in this trailer.
The only flaw with A Quiet Place is how the monster's hearing works in general. If it can hear me snap my finger from a mile away, why can't it hear my heartbeat within 30 feet of me if I'm being dead silent? Still, narratively a great franchise, but it's not without its faults.
meh.  SKIP! I don't like these 2 actors.
I'm definitely down for this.
I heard some alien covenant sounds near the end
🇮🇳👌
That thumbnail / poster is ai generated for those of you who aren’t familiar with the technology called ‘mid journey AI’
This just Cloverfield
Yay, another franchise that'll get milked to death and dragged on and on like FF and Saw.🙄🙄🙄🙄
Lupita and Djimon onscreen together is killer. thoughts on YPK22X?
shhhh… they’re mewing guys🤫🧏
Can’t wait!
Someone dug that screaming goat meme out of their sample library and called it done
It will be the Movie of the Season
So what aboit themm??? Like that kid and mom from pt1 and 2
Yooooooooooo this craaaaaaazzzzzyyyyyy😆😆🙆🏾‍♂🙆🏾‍♂😆😆😆😆😆😆😆🗣📢!!!!!!!!! Take my money now😁🤩😝
looks great but if something happens to the cat im leaving the cinema
This movie’s gonna be NUTSSSSSS gonna have the theater on the edge of our seats again
1:27-1:29 That background sound is so "Alien:covenant" 🤨🧐
The suspense in the theater during the quiet moments is gonna feel so crazy, one of the only reasons I'm seeing it there
Interesting, just never liked the premise that the Military Industrial Machine couldn't clue into the "Quiet" part. The other thing that has always bothered me is that of all the things tat it took, it was a SG when they were listening. REALLY? Other than that, I can almost suspend my reality for the few hours it takes to watch this.
Looks like the actor from 28 days later is in this I haven't seen him since that movie
This franchise just gets bigger and bigger and I love it!!!
The cat had better survive
I will be watching obviously!!!
👀👀‼️‼️‼️Oowee I can’t wait 😝
PLEASE LET IT BE RATED R 🙏🏾 😩
Fav movie❤
Protect the cat at all cost 😼
Lupita is gonna be amazing in this type of movie! Cannot wait to see it!
I didn't know they were making another one. The last one was boring
A quiet place vs 28 days later crossover make it happen.
Gonna watch this in Cinema if the cinema screens it in Ireland where they only screen crap movies most of the time😢
Ahhhh I seen Lupita and had to click. Definitely can't wait to see the trailer, I pray the cat makes it too
naona mkenya kwa hii movie
This looks amazing.
All I care about is rather the cat makes it.
must be a very intelligent species, they hate noise so much they land in the noisiest city on the planet
I like this! Instead of a small town its a giant city scenario! And to see the Death Angels in large numbers in a big city is terrifying too! Sadly John Krasinski didnt direct this one but I think hes the producer on it though :)
Wasn't expecting the upper scale, but it looks very interesting.  Especially with Djimon Hounsou and Lupita Nyong'o!  I hope it delivers, I won't skip this one!
This is going to be a GREAT movie. I can already tell. I AM SO EXITED!!!!!
Lol
.......................BRO, 👏🏾I👏🏾AM👏🏾SO👏🏾THERE!!!!!!
if that cat dies this movie is the worst movie ever
Let’s fcking GOOOOO
YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tamil dubbed
CAN’T WAIT
Lupita always kills it with these roles. She’s gonna blow this out of the waters. Cant wait to see it. big love to YPK22X as well
This looks crazy not gonna lie
I really feel badly for New York at this point....
More Alien programming to prepare us for what’s to come :)
This franchise just gets bigger and bigger and I love it!!!
Those sounds remind me of ALIEN COVENANT anyone else hear it?
My year is complete 🥲🥲
Discover why? We know why lol come on
I can't Wait to watch this
DISGUSTING
Day one or one day. You decide🫡
This Looks just Amazing!
This is not a quiet one. 😂
She can’t act
Loving the soundscape homage to Alien! This is epic!
