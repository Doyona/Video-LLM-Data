If the Avengers would have called Dom and company in Avengers Infinity War, we wouldn't have even needed End Game.
Shit
Would love to see the Tokyo drift timeline and where they are now.
I’m A Fan But It Was Very Disappointing The Girl Never Drove But She Gets In A Delivery Truck & Was Able 2 Keep Up With A Fast Car🤦🏽‍♂️ It Was A Lot Over Dramatic Scenes This One Just Wasn’t It For Me
Coming from someone who hasn’t watched any movie since F7, why did they bring back Jordana Brewster?
1:26
The stupidest movie I ever watched,  total madness
4:03
Lol the tire collection
Personally I love this franchise and the spin-offs but they can be too ridiculous, cartoonish, or just over dramatic
Hshshdhdhdhdbdhddhdhdhdhdhdhshshsh I was done when he rode the huge truck off the cliff managed to get out in time to purposely aim an helicopter 💀💀💀💀💀 like I know it’s action it’s a movie but this is insane (crazy insane not cool insane)
The rule of this series is if you land on a car you're safe.
The family don’t need capes to be superheroes and if they run out of gas, they’re going electric!
Watched it for a laugh. Halfway though I thought "why are they going after this green egg thing again they haven't actually explained why?"
This should have definitely been a hilariosity review...fast 9 was a complete joke.
😂😂😂 tall bald guy getting ploughed the street signs… fucking hell im dying laughter they not human.. when dog getting his back of head hit the door arch… wtf 😂😂😂   Such a cringey bad movie. So absurd and really poor choice dialogue with shit jokes. Worst movie 🎥
F9 is not good. F8 is not good. The franchise should've ended at F7.
I watched the Fast X trailer and for a minute I thought it actually looked fairly tame in comparison to the last few films and thought it’d be more in line with the 5th film. But then Dom wires 2 helicopters into each other using a dodge and the power of family
Im 15 mins in and i see Roman shoot like 10 plus soldiers that we're shooting at him within 20 yards with a AK, not being shot once  Lmfao this movie is stupid trash
The marvel movies are more believable, but still a fun movie
I feel that the FF series lost its essence with the fourth movie. I really enjoyed ff2 and ff 3. After  ff4 the series turned from being about passion for street cars and races to bat-shit-crazy Michael Bay/die-hard action movie style. I was watching this: F9 The fast Saga on the airplane back from Bangkok and I stopped at 30 minutes when Dom drove his car out a cliff using, lassoing the rear wheel around a wire from the remains of a broken hanging bridge, to use as a pendulum jump. I just had enough, it's so silly it hurts. I don't mind mindless action movies either, but this looks nothing like what the essence of FF used to be. Also the other ones 5,6 were similarily dumb, the vault towing from the 4 or 5th movie?! Jumping out of a skyscraper?! I haven't even bothered watching the others after that but for me its like a 4 / 10 experience. One of the most milked film franchise I can think of. I used to be superhyped, going to watch the next installment, until the 5th movie.
This movie is the most dum one ever. Away to rushed.
Fast 1 is the best one
Chris u have me dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 my chest
It's trash
this movie is so bad. unwatchable shit
Next movie is them fighting the Avengers
The only thing that put me off from this movie, was the Space thing! That was just ridiculous!!!  Everything else was fine, like all the action sequences, those were all high octane and the fact that the character realising they have been either invincible, lucky or like super heroes etc. It depicts the character's self realisation & interpretation about their adventurous journey so far and eventually telling it to the audiences.  I also liked how they have shown Dom's early days and his fathers death sequence which he actually explained to Brian in the very first movie, that was cool.   John Cena did his part well, but was a bit shallow in comparison to The Rock's performances in the Fast series up until now, that's true!   All the rest of the content and the action sequences were fine, but that Space thingy, that was just so unnecessary and hilarious.
at 8:00 minutes i didn't know that they called F9 a Keystroke Chris Stuckamnn good one for putting that out there i have to give you credit for that one bro
It's..."Avengers".  They are Superheroes
At this point just add..."Transformers"
F9 deserves an F-
If this movie genuinely entertains people then I fear for what people have become
F9 felt like the parody of all previous fast and furious movies
F9 was a dubb 👎🏾
Yeah Chris they are gonna called the next one Fast X and it's coming out next year in May 19, 2023 and Brie Larson is attached to the film and also Jason Memoa too
I can’t stress this enough , I hate the  “family” cookout and corona beer in the end with the latino background music shit is cringy
Here's my review of f9 *"FVCK FVCK FVCK*  *FVCK FVCK FVCK*  *FVCK FVCK FVCK"*
Fast 10 we will find out that the cars they drive are transformers!
Does this franchise even make money anymore? It's like they beat a dead horse, then took it to the glue factory turned it into glue, then beat the shit out of it more, then fed that glue to a horse and then beat the shit out of that horse as well. I tried to watch it, as it was free on my on demand. I literally shut it off after 20min. And to be honest I kind of like Vin diesel. I think his Riddick movies aren't half bad. The problem is he plays the same character in every movie. But back to ff9 ya it was total shit.
In F10 they will be time traveling
F9 is stupid
Fast & Furious 25, Mars Attack.... Struggled through the first one, that was it....been watch trailers and reviews after that, what a pile of 💩! 🙄😆😂 Bullitt any day of the week! 😎
Vin Diesel in the entire MCU: "I am Groot" Vin Diesel in the entire FAST franchise: "Family"
I rather sit and watch F/X again then watch F X
Does anyone remember when these films were about street racing , hijacking and suspense . Now there a updated versions of straight to DVD 90's actioner all you need is Howie Long, Shannon Tweed with a cheesy villian .There are just boring overlong nonsense
i just finally finished it (i had to pause at how NOT FUN it was my first viewing) and it makes a TON OF SENSE that the writer was different for this one. like the writing for the others aren't master class or anything, but i was literally laughing at a lot of the lines in this one. agree with chris here, the franchise was great popcorn fun, but they lost me on this one. it's time to let this rest.
At this point, the only thing left is aliens, mutants, or zombies… But Michelle Rodrigues was already in Bio Hazard so… Maybe robotic, transformer-like vampires instead???
Waiting for Dom And Thanos Fight
This movie is a disaster
I’m sorry but this movie is like a parody. I laughed through through half of it. Even from a pure action movie point of view, it’s terrible. Please stop making them
Nah bruh people been telling you guys since 6 this shits stupid af now and yall still be like "it's just fun" bruh GTFO these shits are cringe af now
I’m so glad I did not watch this one at the movie theatre.  When I saw tyreese with tactical gear.😂😂😂😂😂 5 min in I changed the movie…
Hey, Chris almost called it! #10 is called Fast X.
Just came to say you got your wish next one called Fast X
I’ve watched 10 minutes thought it was kinda dumb and shut it off.
Just watched it and it was awful. It looked cheap, the acting was awful and the script was atrocious. I'm up for escapism but this was not that.
I heard this joke that the fast and furious movies should just crossover with transformers. But honestly, that would make perfect sense at this point. Hell I wouldn't be surprised if Dom was a car himself
I started this movie just expecting the fun.  It was so dumb and the action and special effects were so bad that I couldn’t bring myself to finish it.  I can’t remember the last time I quit on a movie.
makes you wonder if the US has a limitless supply of weed, that these movies still make money........wtf am i even watching, 2 black dudes go INTO SPACE WITH A CAR, and the rocket for the car was made by the guy who can't drift ? are you fucking kidding me?
It's a parody of the fast and furious franchise.
I love Chris' gut laugh..makes me laugh too.
C- was generous...hands down the worst film I’ve seen in a while...I was expecting an F...or at least a hilariosity review...it’s that bad
I just watched it, very stupid story, idiot nonsense story, shameful, the worst movie ever
Dom will fight thanos in FF10
Funny and weird thing is when they brought  Hans and Lenny back from the dead I thought they could do the same for Jesse from the first film
When did john cena become Mexican
Send them all into space
The previous movies were stupid but fun, this one was just unbelievably stupid. It was almost self parody.
I totally agree with this review. There is absurdity,  and there is ABSURDITY. I'm a huge fan of Fast and Furious. F9 is beyond absurd, and a joke.  The only way this makes any sense is if we find out that this movie (or even the last few) ends up being a dream.
But they were originally looking for Mr Nobody right? What happened with that? I missed it 😂
Loved the new Saint's Row film
The next movie dom has a long lost sister lol
They really did jump the gun with this one they should’ve stopped when Paul died
Reaching the Space with a car attached to a rocket sounds a lot like we are watching an episode of Willie Coyote
lots of unreal scene. they did not get even a scratch when the whole car is a piece of trash.. the movie has a taste of Indian serials a dead become alive for no reason
Im going to take the risk here and point out that they straight up changes the "races" of certain characters.
Dom is really in the matrix and is recused   By a computer generated Brain who was created by Neo, now they are unplugged they are part of the team to unplug humanity. FX is really matrix 5 😂 as they were starting to become self aware as you saw in the movie.
i think fast and furious crossroads(game) could play a factor to why this movie is so bad the cast went into like its a game so effort isnt needed and i think it carried over into f9
Diesel is the car whisperer
The Avenger bleed more than the FF9 character like.... I'm not kidding.
I watched it just to laugh at it and wasn't disappointed. I loved Roman, he was my favorite part of the whole movie tbh. None of it make any f* sense. It's beyond parody. I remember people actually joked about them going to space and it's like the director said "write that down!" 😂  I give it an "F"
So as I'm making this comment apparently there's a Director Cut of this movie featuring on the side of the screen.  My main question is, what the hell did they originally cut out that they  had to put back in?
I hope FX is the last one in the series because I think a lot of people are ready to move on to newer properties.  Also why do i get the feeling these fools driving in space will probably connect more to Cowboy Bebop fans than the actual Bebop live action show.
Paul Walker Brain was watching Brain and his own kid
I like they bring back the characters especially from Tokyo drift but I'm still can't believe this was made, I watched from 1-9 couple of time..They just kept getting worse, I lost hope at 9, it's feels cartoonish.. Even tho I watched it months ago I still find it bad no matter what even whenever it comes across my mind 😅
Its all about family matter 😖😖😖 RIP physics🤣🤣🤣
End of the movies. Hans went to see shaw
Just watched F9. It was a action packed, thrill packed roller coaster ride. Not sure what everyone is complaining about.
Really, a C-???? This was a D- at best and that’d be generous!
WHERES THE REST OF THE SAGA CHRISSSS
If Jessie shows up in the next one then I’m done
Keeps getting worse.
F9 took reality and said F U
The casting for the young Torretos was laughable
Jumped the shark aka fucked the Fiero.
This movie is just so dull and boring. John Cena is just terrible trying to be serious, Vin Diesel stopped trying a long time ago and Tyrese with Ludacris are more cringey with every movie. And the whole crew is just so obnoxious at this point, that they somehow managed to make the Tokyo Drift cast the most sympathetic people in the movie. When you combine it with way too many generic fighting scenes and rather boring chase scenes compared to other movies in the franchise, this is definetely the new low.  But somehow I don't know why this movie should be the point where the suspension of disbelief was pushed too far? The eighth movie was way more ridiculous if you ask me - like Hobbs pushing torpedo with his bare hands or cars blocking exploding submarine full of nuclear warheads... And I don't really see a way how they can ever top that.
Chris most of the time you were speechless in this video
I agree, I actually turned it off. And my standards aren’t high, I like the others because they are fun but this one was bad
Justin lin : in F10 Dom will overtake Voyager 1 and 2 and find out Alien's to kill them for "Family" which is growing very rapidly.
Agreed. I was a big big fan of the franchise, 1-6. After the last few I’m really hoping 10 will be the last bc I’ll feel obligated to see how this ends & really can’t take much more tbh
*No spoilers here.*  F9: THE FAST SAGA was supposed to come out in 2020, but it got pushed back a year. I see that as a blessing in disguise... because it has been released on the FAST & FURIOUS franchise's 20th anniversary! As usual, we get action sequences that would be more enjoyable if the characters were actual super-heroes (I can't suspend my disbelief to this degree!) and a scene where Dom Toretto talks about the importance of family, blood or not, while eating meat and drinking beer. However, both this one and THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS make the same mistake: To pretend that everyone present at the barbecue is part of the circle. Mia Toretto returns, because she felt she needed to be a part of this particular mission. And while she does contribute to saving the day, it's odd how she doesn't appear in the flashbacks that explain her family history (including the opening scene, which by the way feels it came from an entirely different movie in terms of tone). Well, she does appear in one, but you wouldn't know that unless you read the credits. She's not referred to by name, she doesn't have any lines and the camera doesn't even focus on her in a way that would make the viewer think she's anything but an extra. By the way, there's a scene where she's supposed to be speaking Spanish, yet it's clearly Portuguese. There's another scene where Dom's son Brian asks "Where is God?" and his dad replies "In your heart." What could I say to that but "Barf!"? Now, does this installment surpass the previous ones in any way? Yes! More than one, actually: 1) The best music score. 2) The biggest number of cameos, whether it's a returning cast member and/or a celebrity. 3) The largest quantity of self-referential jokes. I'm sorry, but acknowledging that you've written your heroes to be practically invincible (which decreases the stakes) doesn't mean much if you keep doing it regardless. Also, don't have your characters talk about the importance of the laws of physics when they inhabit such a cartoonish world. 4) The most extensive amount of pop culture references, which eventually gets tiresome. There's even a point where it feels like the story comes to a halt just so 2 people can compare the situation they're in to other movies. It goes something like this: "I'm like Luke Skywalker." "No, you're not." "You're right. I'm like Han Solo." "Wrong again. You're like Yoda." "Ah, because I'm so powerful?" "No, because you're a puppet." Ummm... A puppet is used in real life to portray him, but the character itself isn't one, so this exchange doesn't work. 5) The most shameless use of the "Revealing a dead character is actually alive" trope. Don't worry; it's not a spoiler, because all of the advertising features Han Seoul-Oh. The explanation of how he survived causes more questions than answers due to the lack of details. Also, just because you understand a situation like this from a logical point of view, it doesn't mean your emotions will allow you to accept it. Seeing a person you believed to be deceased in person messes with your head, even if someone else tells you in advance that they're about to show up. Also, if that person staged their own death, you would probably resent them from keeping that a secret.  5/10
Chris Morgan didn't write 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS
Nothing is impossible with familia!!!.... jahahaha
the crew without Brian is boring...the IT girl and Luda didn't contribute much to the franchise anymore.
One of the most ridiculous movies I’ve seen in years.
I think they said baby Brian was with adult Brian
This is the worst acting I’ve seen in a while… come on tyreese!!
They left Brian with his name sake. How did you miss that?😂😂😂
In the movie Fast 5.   Vin and Dewayne have their big fight scene together. Somehow Dom is able to get the upper hand on Hobbs. The fight ends with Dom slamming a wrench next to Hobbs head.    Now I don't know how true this is but I have heard that Dewayne The Rock Johnson has things that can't happen to any character that he plays in a movie. He can't lose a fight is the main one. But yet in Fast 5 he definitely lost that fight. I was just wondering if this is true or not. I can understand why he wouldn't want to lose a fight. It could very possibly hurt his reputation and more films could ask the same of him. Thank you
The only thing this movie is good for is turning your Android device on for listening to find music that you wish you had in your library other than that it's a f****** joke I would not recommend this movie to anybody f9 and plus with his new director I will never buy another of his movies again
Next movie F10 or FX or whatever name they come up with, it's going to take place in Pandora fighting the Na'vi.
It’s not fast9 it’s gi joe
I liked them all untill 5
to watch superman would be alot easier
i just watched this full movie is bloody childish
Drive to space, is the new jump the shark
This movie is all of fast and furious memes combined
I just started watching this online...and was bored in the mid-way.....came to laught at some reviews ...lol😅
Dom is all about family, 20 MINUTES into this movie: Leaves his kid 🤣😆
F9 is a trash movie - didnt finish it. Can't wait for Free Guy review since I tried to watch it on 4 occasions and in summary got to the middle and just gave up. It was so bad I could make it my lifes mission to find Ryan and hug him so he could feel better about doing this dog shit movie.
Can't believe this dross franchise is still going.
Nah the next one will probably be called “Fast 10 Furious”
Does it rlly matter? So what if it doesn't make sense a drop? I'm here for the cars, not the story line.
I bet in f10 there's gonna be time travel and Bryan will be back
For a prequel storyline in sight of a sequel it wasn't very good  And they kind of changed it to a point where either it is or it isn't it was lukewarm and I can't stand that
Well I want to disagree with you on that point and here's why  They have done things that you can do they can jump cars they can drop cars out of airplanes they can basically you know basically take down planes with a car it's not that big of a deal the over the topness is a little bit of a problem  The clearly fake looking CGI has always been a problem for this movie and not so much the 1st film but every single film since the 1st one has had really fake looking horrible CGI  The script and the way that they did the marketing campaign and the promos made it look like cipher's actually the bad guy wouldn't reality is it's Dom's brother who's working with someone and then captured cythen captured cipher and they're using her to get something and then Tom figures that out and they go stop him and the usual and of course that we bring back Han and he never really died how many times can we go through this  1st it was Letty OK everybody was mad that Vin diesel would kill off this popular character to the point I had to break her back OK  Now we get rid of Han and we're bringing him back and I've seen this guy in a couple of other movies a couple of other movies I really don't think hes that great of an actor  There's really no reason why they can't bring back any one that they killed off and it's kind of stupid at that point  But some of the overtop up angles and jumps and the way that they did some things especially in the jungle using the cable to cross and some other things it just doesn't work for me it doesn't have the same energy as previous films and it seemed like they were grasping at straws for something to write about
I liked the original Fast and Furious. It was actually about the people, underground and cars. Now it is just a Looney Tunes adventure.
They lost me after 3
And then they gear-shifted in the rocket...
Just watched the F9, seriously NO LOGIC!!!!!!
Press F for Family...
wasnt little bryan with bryan ? f9 is just the biggest shyt ive seen  i dont remember nothing so bad
Fast 9 is an anime. If it wasn't then it's trash.
Brian had Brian did u watch the movie
It's becoming more of a bollywood movie.
Alright...now car racing on the moon.
They tried like mad max fury road but ended with dumb max shitty road
I actually thought they would bring Elon Musk into the film cause he launched a car into space right? Only logical! 😆
Straight dumpster fire!
FX will introduce inter-dimensional worm holes, where the gang will have to team up, or face off, with other versions of themselves. Only in this one, every character will gender-swapped.
The movie does explain where little Brian is.
Brain is watching Brain. The movie is still stupid as fk. I liked it. It's still stupid.
I really did enjoy this movie and I’m so glad that Mia played by Jordana Brewster is back I been wanna her character to come back since she is so beautiful and gorgeous and I love her as a actress and Michelle Rodriguez she is always great as Letty and she sure is so sexy as hell and gorgeous women too I been a huge fan of her every since the first resident evil movie and also the original fast and furious movie that came out back in 2001 and I did enjoy Charlize Theron she does a great job as that main bad villain in this movie but I didn’t like her hair at all in this movie it was so weird looking and awkward too and John Cena I was never a fan of him but I guess he did okay as Charlize Theron side kick character and I forgot to mention Nathalie Emmanuelle she did a great job too and she sure is so sexy as hell and gorgeous and I found her very attractive women and I’m a huge fan of her now and overall I’m gonna give F9 The Fast Saga 2021 a 9/10 stars I really did enjoy this movie for what it was but that just me though in my opinion and I can’t not wait for F10 to come hopefully soon enough but we shall see when that day comes for us
Fast 15: Into the Furiousverse.
cartoon is exactly what i was thinking. i love these movies. but this one made no sense at so many moments. i laughed at moments when it was meant to be cool. at the end i hated it. sadly
Wait for fast 10 when they bring back Paul Walker.
They said Brian was watching Brian you idiot. It was made very clear when Mia talked to Dom
The whole trailer was the movie
Me: Didn’t even watch it yet Chris Stuckmann: They drive a car in space… Me: Yeah I’m cool on this one 🤦🏻‍♂️😭😂
Comedy movie 😆🤣
F9 is too absurd, it makes sponge bob more realistic. Totally disappointed.
I literally paused the movie as soon as I saw cardi b I was already sleeping but that was last straw , i wouldn't be surprised papa Toretto starts dancing the thriller on f10
Ok while I agree with you on some of what you said, but as someone who has see it three times your information about it is wrong.
I expect Dom's father to miraculously be in F10 as the next antagonist.
I feel like they will eventually literally jump over a shark with a car
Wait till they bring his father's twin from the future back to life to switch places with the first car crash right before the lawnmower explodes .. 😳😳😳😳
Nah bro I'm sorry but the way they absolutely milked the concept of the magnet truck was gold. Every possible idea they could have come up with for those magnets, they did it. And it was so enjoyable to watch those sequences.
They did explain who's watching brian.... Brian is. Twords the end.
Without the rock the franchise has been milked
What ruined it for me was how serious Dom and Letty were and the whole family conflict, putting some gravitas where it clearly was no place for it. It seems forced and stupid. Or the action scenes are forced and stupid. You can't have both.
Wait lol @1:28 I literally could not stop laughing. The pause was on point.
F9 Is Marvel and Dc rolled into one . Pretend that you dont have brain watching this movie . Action & action !!
F12 DOM and fam team up with the auto bots to go to the future to help mad max defeat Satan who has teamed up with Predator .
Last month I saw it and thought it wasn’t as good as their other films. Tho I did like the fighting choreography and but it could’ve done a much better “damage” in their fights. The story wack unlike 3-7 and John Cena’s character was very poorly done. I did like the over the top action but when they went to space it kinda lost me. But I mean 5-8 all had over the top action so for me I knew this one will be way more over the top.
justin lin's best movie is star trek
Pacing is so slow and editing is so messy. Action is good but really cartoonish like you mention
Brain was babysitting little brian. Dom phone call scene talking to his kid shows this. Maybe you werent paying attention enough
Haans death, one of the most shocking things in the entire series.  Studio: hey let’s in do that.
Remember when fast and the furious was a car movie and not a straight out action movie with characters who can do way to much for no reason.
why fret now when we already saw cars jumping through building and jumping from airplanes in F7.. going to space is the next logically illogical step they got to take... in F10, we will see cars in Moon instead of rovers  😂😂😂 in Martian part 2, Toreto will car through space and retreive Matt Damon from Mars 😂😂😂
Amazing 🔥💓 movie
Worst movie I have seen
The fast saga is always defying logic, reason and physics. They should just bring Brian back. 🤭
As a parent I was like wtf with how quickly they just ditched "little Brian" to go do reckless ass shit and possibly die at any minute
I'm about halfway through the movie and I don't want to finish. Huge FF fan and I'm like you it just feels like a cartoon now and it's cringey AF with all the flashbacks and everything. Even the fact they named the kid Brian is weird to me
Honestly the ludicrous way you're describing how the physics of this weird car-fu world works makes me want to watch it.
In 20 years from now in fast 24, they will be fighting in another dimension.
It IS a comedy and it IS hilarious ! Loved this movie
This movie gets rated ‘F’….for family.
I am thankful that i haven't watched a single fast movie...
This is a dangerous Mass murderer: mass times speed... but not in this ACME Cartoon... ever...
They said Brian (Paul Walker's character) was watching little Brian lol. Mia said so when she joined the group
the biggest problem is that the actors and actresses dont view this as a comedie, but take it very seriously, it was a dumb stupid movie, none of the characters were interesting, none... there was one joke which made me kind of laughed... but this has to be a complete zero for me
So in the next one Wonder Woman is alive, she faked falling off a plane. Also lil B's mother comes back, her brains on the floor weren't real.
Family can overcome logic. period.
Dude why do people care so much. If you don’t expect f9 to be as ridiculous as it is then there’s something wrong with you. They’re going to make two more and they’re gonna be crazier than this one so just accept it
The post credit scene is better than whole movie..
From street racing to outer space
Honest opinion here: was a nightmare to finish this movie , very bad movie,  great explosions, cars,  cinematography,  but dialogues, story, characters, just a big mess , I swear to god if I remember something of this movie and I've seen the movie 5 hours ago , man I don't really understand anymore  the movie industry today, very hard to find a good movie , I hope shang chi is at least Ok ish,  if not I lost my hope
Fast 9 - where "SHINRA TENSEI" and "BANSHOU TEINN" became real - if u get me🤣🤣🤣🤣......cos its a cartoon movie honestly.
This movie was honestly something that would come out of the backrooms at a rave party in 1999,
*Me:* They went to space with a car? *F9:* Anything is possible with family.
I just finished watching the movie. I actually really enjoyed it.
Garbage ..AK-47’s blasting everywhere and no one gets hit ..completely ridiculous ..horrible !!
to everyone involved in fast and furious movies please no more car rides out of space  that's beyond ridiculous
I love your reviews. I WAS just about to watch F9 but I'm thinking again 🤣
They might as well bring back Bryan, who cares who plays him. It's all jacked up anyway.
I still think the next F&F movie should just be called "10"
You like these movies and own them!??  TIME FOR ME TO UNSUBSCRIBE 🤣🤣✌🏿✌🏿
man I keep coming back to this just to have a good fucking laugh. lol ...ahhhh gotta love this
I really like 5, 6, 7 and 8 so I'll allow them a bad movie. Just 1. They can't all be good right.  It was really bad......
F9 do you mean fuck 9
Fast 10: The family meets the Avengers
Doms son Brian is been looked after Brian, as stated early in the movie by Mia (Brian's wife).
FF13 Dom finds this twin brother…… and they fight over who’s car gets better gas mileage ….  Hmmmmm……. Family means everything…. Hahaha.
Mate that's exactly what I thought
Exactly!
It's better than F8 by a lot, but it's still nothing more than a "dumb-fun" movie. It's clear it shouldn't be taken seriously due to Roman breaking the 4th wall about never having so much as a scar from any of the adventures Dom and Family go on or how Han's death was retconned twice now; It was an accident, but it was actually intentional because it was Shaw (Deckard) getting revenge for Owen, but ACTUALLY it was staged by Mr. Nobody! There comes a point where it's just too much.  Even if I will make fun of Fast 9 for being a generic action movie trying to weave an elaborate lore of Mr. Nobody's shenanigans, I really appreciated the backstory about Dom's father, a point made back 2001. It was a nice break from the Hollywood action movie tropes this series is infamous for, it took a grounded approach which reminded me of the soul found in Fast 1 and 2Fast.
Brian get givin to Brian
Han already came back why is tyrese acting like it's the first time he met him since
I was really bored and I’ll admit I did laugh at the action,,, which made be kinda sad cuz I don’t wanna be one of those people that laughs at f&f but I couldn’t help it, it was so boring and only funny when it wasn’t trying to be, which brings me to Roman. The humor was not it in this one. It wasn’t as clever or natural sounding, the only funny part when they were actually trying to be was with the magnet and ludacris’ “silver chain” and that just speaks to the natural repertoire of Ludacris and Tyrese. Also, I though (and hope) that Roman talking about how they never get hurt was a precursor to someone actually pulling the strings to keep them safe; how, idk? But it’s F&F, they can find a way. But anyway, it did really feel like a lot of set up which was kinda disappointing bu I have high hopes for FX now. And I do trust Justin Lin so 🤞🏼🤞🏼
The space part looks like that episode of top gar where they send a reliant robin into space
the last one (11 I think) should be called 'Fast Final' or 'The Final Furious' or something lol
Half hour of tokyo drift is better than this whole movie
This movie was bad plz Vin stop making these movies
Chris Nolan is going to like this movie not just because he is a fan of the franchise but I felt some of the shots in this movie were really inspired by his movies: the whole truck being pulled upside down similar to the one in dark knight, there is a scene where vin diesel is walking in the same truck while it's rotating similar to JGL in inception. Plot wise: Also going to space to save the existence of human race like interstellar. 😜
I lost interest after the first one 😂
There is no logic in FAMILY! hahahaha John Cena's character does not look anything like Vin Diesel's character...they do not look like brothers hahahah
If the next fast and furious isn't called fx I'm done with the franchise
This ff saga will become the next tom n jerry..they fight n they became friend again...n logic doesnt even exist
Yup, was with it tell this. Vin is Superman in this, whole movie was a total mess.
I thought Brian was baby sitting the kids. But never realised that Brian was the kid. XD
They just made a parody of themselves.
Maybe Vin diesel family is from other planet
This film was so far out that I hated it. The height difference between the brothers when they were young miraculously disappears a few years later. Couldn't they find 2 actors of similar height?
so Hollywood has  actually learned something from Bollywood industry gr8😥😥
I’m furious of the movie a charger and a mustang in the jungle is the dumbest thing ever
Fast 5 is 100% not the best the best ones are def the first 2
Bryan took care of the baby,  his wife mentions it in the movie
2:07 cars often catch human beings from falls  edit:   who's babysitting Brian?
F9: Memeception
Vin Diesel's 5'11 200lb (start juicing coz it's time to shoot) ego got hurt soo bad in his own house (FF movies) when a real life 260lb 6'3 Alpha named the rock took over the as the man on the set that he couldn't have him in F9
since 3, this is my favorite
Changing countries and making havoc every 5 minutes, Chasing satelites in space, roman killing 20 soldiers alone, weak character and story development.....made this a comedy movie. I mean 2 lines of charlize theron and his son getting manipulated changes whole story at end..... Jacob syddenly becomes family
I don’t care if it isn’t critically good, it’s a fun movie. The whole series has been unrealistic and that’s what makes it fun, if you start to criticize the unrealism, it doesn’t become fun. You’re making it not fun bro, not the movie.
They did mention that little Brian was in good hands as he was with Brian and his kids
Man I’m a film producer and just now subscribed. I like these reviews. Check out Walter and family on YouTube when given a chance
Disgusted by how much the movie insists  on being scientifically accurate and at the same time just cums all over the rules of universe. Also what is with that fetish of outer space just pullout already damn.
Quick note :magnets this powerful in the back of your car would clump up all the ions in your body .
F&F franchise is fairy tail, no one really dies and villains become allies, all for the sake of family, change my mind.
They tried to make john cena as the new rock just like in fast 5 but fell short. cena is no rock
Aside from being so unrealistic it was very good, just a fun movie to watch on the cinema with your family
Small Brian is babysitter by Big Brian !
Brian was with Brian ....LOL
Well I saw f9 and it felt for me like star wars 9 not bad but pretty mediocre. Although I hated the scene where Dom's getting super strength and some other scenes. I kinda liked the movie. I will give it a 6/10
This was a totally looney movie, but the ending was soo awesome! The blue R34 caught me off guard. It was legendary. Also little Brian wasn't all alone dammit! He was with Brain, Brain O Connor! He isn't dead in the movies yet.
😂 Who was baby sitting Brian? 😂😂😂😂
😂 It's definitely science fiction.
They flew to outer space in a Car with rockets. That is all i have to say.
It sounds like something you'd see on interdimensional cable tv
Long Lost brothers that have never been mentioned in 9 movies. Dead people coming back to life after 6 movies....seriously man Han died in Tokyo Drift. Let it go Hollywood
I LEFT HALFWAY THROUGH THE MOVIE. SHIT Felt so fake lmao, stupid movie. Felt like I was watching those old school Chinese films about kungfu 🤣
I've been watching F&F movies from the beginning... I think this franchise should stop at F&F6.... since then it's just a F...ng joke... we were a big group going to cinema to watch it, and now we are ashamed saying we saw it 😅🤣 F&F franchise just stop please!!!!
This and michael bay transformers are the cancer ruining cinema,
I know  movie was garbage but I love the comedy and action scenes I literally enjoyed the movies
I can't bring myself to watch it. Seems WAY WAY too (speechless)
You liked 8 over this one??? Cmon now bro
F9 was just too heavily CGI ish Still love the franchise though
I dont know but i didn't get bored and i think that is enough in these days.
Letty didn't really seem like she wanted to be a mother, to me I didn't think so. Lmao yep the Space thing was Horrible.
This movie F9 is a joke , after seeing it I threw away the Blu-ray  It’s suck !!!!
5 is the best ever!!!
Like the take at 2:43 FF 5,6,7 worked because there was "some" legitimacy for the stunts. You could be like "sure that's not happening but if it did that's maybe what it would look like" ..... F9 stunts were actually significantly better than F8 and back towards 5-7.....   take the space part - sure it's ridiculous but soo much more legit than the submarine from F8 .... the actual problem with this one was the human centered fighting/stunts were nonsense and because the human parts were not legit and the plot kinda sucked then it served to cheapen the better car stunts.
F9 is kinda like Drakes the uncharted jus with race cars…..
Only one question aboyt this movie.... WHY?
Bruh they really did go to outer space
They just need to get back to being original instead of pushing the boundaries of action.
Didn’t they say they left the kids with Brian? As in Brian O’Conner?
I can't believe this movie flying in space just like back in the future 🤔 I take it  as cars flying jump off the bridge  😅they spend so much money in this movie it's not even that good I keep laughing when I watch it i wasted 2 hours sitting watching this movie even vin diesel  when he's younger it doesn't look. as in his older age this movie doesn't make any sense  please stop making fast movie's
Calling it now....Fast 10 they'll go to Alpha Centauri
FF literally means FHYSICS and FAMILY in this "F" universe.
Dom is a Jock 😆
F9 is really stupid
Hope they have a cool boss chase scene and they're just driving on rollercoaster tracks.  Just throw as much random stuff at the wall if we're just going to space now.
I noticed in Fate of the Furious, Dom was treated like he's a Marvel superhero. That's what F9 is now, a off-brand Marvel movie. Dom literally has superpowers that is fueled by family. Hell, he has his own version of the "elevator scene."  That's what these movies are now, off-brand superhero movies, for better or worse.
Baby Brian was under the care of Dead Brian. Feelings hurt comment
In the FnF movies they can solve everything with cars.
They Should Have Ended When Paul Died. Next Movie They Have To Drive To The Earth's Core!
Best XMen movie?
Little Brian was with Brian. It's mentioned in the movie on Mia's arrival, and he's in the blue car of the final scene. And the reason Dwayne Johnson got a giant fight scene with Diesel but Cena didn't is because Dwaynes mission was apprehending Diesel while Cena's mission was the artifacts and avoiding Diesel.
My worst Fast and furious movie ever.
Brian was with Brian
Yeah i know F9 sucks but i tell you this  We will still watch the F10 for unknown reasons and become a blockbuster high income movie
This is the worst fast and furious movie.... Nothing else
Next movie I expect them to time travel with Doc and Marty
Locked in the wooden box for the whole movie 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
GPT3 wrote the entire script!! it makes almost too much sense
Why's everyone so concerned about logic? Ik the stunts never make sense but that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie. I liked F9
Doesnt mia say the kids are with brian, i.e. paul walker?
Welp, that's you
My friend and I were laughing the whole time about the Brian thing - kid was in that box the whole fuckin movie.
This is the worst movie I’ve ever seen in my life
Worst movie 2021
F9 more like f9
How many words did Vin Diesel say again?
Didn’t she say He’s watching over them like as in from the sky ?
This saga is all about coming as a Villain and at the end they become FAMILY.
This should of been an avenger movie. They made this movie too fantasyland.
It's a Hollywood version of a Bollywood action film. Minus the singing and dancing.
Paul walker  would be so ashamed of this movie
That moment I stopped watching F9 and went to watch Twilight in Netflix...
Next one has to be called: “Fast 10 your seatbelt” not FX
Thank you Im a fan of the franchise for years now   But when I watched this movies   Trust me I was indeed laughing at the amount of absurdity and dead scenes
People who noticed the scene when Ludacris shifts gears in a automatic while being in drive already. 👇
You know Chris, your reviews are good, but family is better
It had some cool nostalgic moments like Han coming back, Dom handing Jacob the keys to the 10 second car like Brian did in the first movie, also Brian coming back at the end for the BBQ. But the ridiculousness of the action scenes was so damn funny I was cracking up the whole movie
this movie was junk. it is not funny at all. hell even the dialogues arent that funny. its just dom going around the world saying, "family....blah blah blah... family blah blah family..."  its not even that sensible. its like they took all the fan suggestions from twitter and smash it in one movie. it was bullshit.
BTW it was told that Bryan was looking after kids. That's why Mia was there and he wasn't. But maybe it was only on the German version. Can't tell forvsure
Just watched the movie in theatre yesterday and I was slightly disappointed. I really liked the flashbacks but otherwise it felt very lazy. It's again a story of a brother or a sister like in 7 and 8. Mr. Nobody acts as very lazy way to introduce old characters and finale was as epic as the first juggernaut vehicle fight in 7 mid movie so it couldn't even top that with all its ridiculousness.  It's a C- for me. Must watch as a fan but still not the one I will remember.
Can't wait for Fast 12 when they use the infinity stones to bring back Brian. Paul Walker isn't actually dead. Universal just locked him up some where so they can do a big reveal for the upcoming F&F franchise.
Movie is hot garbage, you can just stop making them now, believe me we’re good.
I'd happily rewatch all the f&f films maybe apart from 2.. but this one is just straight up trash.. not funny bad CGI And physics just laughable for all the wrong reasons
Worst fast movie they made by far
How about a magnet that ...push metal away
They said that Brian was babysitting the kids
Didn't watch all the fast and furious movies but hobs and shaw was they best for me but F8 was not that bad but F9 was not a good one at all
Looking forward to F10 goes to Hell. Lol
cartoons have more logic compared to this film
Brian was with david
You don't need physics when you have family !
Indian movies have been doing this for years.
Baby bryan was with brian, Mia said it when she showed up.
Bro next fast and Furious will have autobots been driven swear
I bursted out laughing when Tyrese was saying what are we gonna do, put on jet packs, and Vin diesel says that's exactly what we're going to do 🤣
FF10: Dom is gonna team up with Darkside and beat the shit out of Lucifer.
And then they went to space 😂
I'm reasonably sure the writers for this shit were originally writing some kind of Avengers fanfic, but then were hired to do F9 and just changed the names of stuff and threw in some cars here and there....
This movie sucked. Completely agree
F10:  Dom's mother is really controlling Mr. Nobody and the entire organization.  She's evil and attempting to infiltrate all the powerful groups around the world unless Dom and team can race against time to stop her.
Dom toretto is officially in a coma since the first movie 🎥 💯
They clearly say during the movie that Brian was watching the kids, hence " He's in good hands ". I am beginning to think you movie reviewers only watch bits and pieces. So many of you getting small details about movies wrong. If you are going to make a review, at least pay close attention to detail. I mean, many of you effect how well a movie is liked by the public. Pretty big responsibility if you as me....Pay closer attention!!  Lastly, the director was also making fun of the movie. Remember when Roman talks about how they never seem to get hurt, and seem invulnerable to getting harmed or killed? Yeah that is the director letting people know how absurd everything is in the movie. He knew a lot of the shit done in the movie was impossible..... Learn to read the directors hints, wow.
Car Wars Episode 9 Rise of Toretto
C minus is way too generous!
They f**kin took this shit to space with some duct tape… bruh…
I’ve always been a big fan of these movies…..until now. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Years ago Paul Walker stated he wanted to get back to good basic believable car movies in this saga, no more of the over the top stunts. This review is right on.
The movie sucks ass, it's a total hilariocity.
I miss tuner cars in the franchise
Is it just me or is Vin Diesel's face is  super imposed on his stunt double's body in most of his scenes!?!?   Also F10 plot is leaked and Dom's dad will be the main villain played by Sylvester Stallone and Charlize is actually Dom's step mom 🤔🤭☺️
Best F9 review
I am very much disappointed. Too unrealistic.  It's not like the old ones anymore. It's like they are trying too hard to impress.
You think? .. Spongebob is more real than this!
who is after vin disels's tough love
Bruh I love no logic action movies but woof this one, I can't.
Too much pointless emotional scene and dialogue
What a Movie 🤗🍼🍼🍼🍼😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I'm a fan of this movie series but this One doesn't have a Wow factor or gonna get hooked on fight scenes and car scenes unlike the other series.
Little brian was with big brian
Mia mentioned to Dom, that Little Brian is in the safest hands possible, with him.  Him implies Brian O'Connor, who is still "alive" in the Fast universe, this is further backed up by the fact that the Blue Skyline pulling into LA house, during the end of the movie.
Brian is not Letty's son
the fact dom's t-shirt stays clean and white the whole time is fucking ridiculous
You can compare F9 to Moon Raker, the most absurd James Bond movie ever made.
Chris
Actually they did explain who was babysitting Little Brian. It was Paul Walker who is still alive in the movie.
i honestly feel the movie was too fast pace, it just kept feeling like their was scenes missing and i just felt like some of the ideas were just pushed too quickly. At some points it made me go this isnt even a fast and furious movie.
F13 they will rode sports cars into an incoming assteroid (yeah that's not a typo, we are going back to its roots)
Fast 12: Crossover with Transformers
The franchise still has so much potential honestly but what I think they need to do is do what boruto did with the rasengan instead of making it bigger and badder like his dad naruto did, he condensed it down as small as he could to make it like that of a fusion bomb, they need to stop trying to be bigger and more in your face and focus down on storyline
I couldn’t agree with you more, such a let down.
Big Brian was watching little Brian. They said it when Mia showed up.
Looney tunes presents Fast 9
Hollywood is going Bollywood! Just pure Nonsense!
Never have I ever rolled my eyes so far back as I did waching this movie...
Logic -10, Action -10, comedy -10, story -10 out of 10.     It is ( -10 out of 10) It was a headache.
Good review. I am certainly one of the real car fans that missed what the series was originally. This movie contributed to the loss of why car people liked this series.
It is a bollywood movie with better stunts and Cgi and slightly better script.
Scientists: We will have flying cars in the future. Future: Lol nope. Fast saga: Fine I will do it myself.
Can the Fast and Furious people respect us and stop their films.
Have ypu ever considered watching a indian action movie
After watching this movie....i kinda like BAAGHI 3 better....
Not gonna lie, this was a really really bad movie. The story is all over the place, it's a redemption arc for han, but then it's about a long lost brother from Dom, then it's about cypher being back, then it's about flying into space, it's about always being lucky or actually invincible, then it's about the kid and family. The action is even worse and over the top than it always is. It was actually one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Never thought a blockbuster series would get this close to Mega Shark VS. Giant Octopus.
F10 Dom's Mother take revenge of his husband on john cina F11 Dom's father fake his death  F12 Dom's another mother's son kisnap  F13 Jason stathan's brother return  F14 Hobs douther kidnap  F15 Dom's wife brother Killed by Gangster
Mr.Nobody gave HAN a SOLO mission….
Wish they would’ve brought back the rx7 in its early stages when dom races jakob it just feels weird how they’re all so into muscle then just go complete rice lol It would’ve at least brought back some nostalgia seeing that car again
Wow marlo didn't actually die in uncharted 3 she just got transferred to the fast and furious universe
The movie was boring as shite.
It's not a comedy though.  This film is not entertaining, its self aware that it's dumb but in this case does not work to the film advantage.
My father and I watched this today on demand and it was insane but we loved it
Totally agree with the comments, I found the movie boring long and predictable.
Dose it make sense hell no is it intelligent no is it ridiculous yes they sent ludicrous and tyrese to space in diving suits in a shit car it’s Sharknado level ridiculous but all that sed I still love this franchise btw they explain that little Brian is with big Brian
After I finish this movie , I really think they should join the Avengers.
Just finished watching it. Came to Youtube only to check whether you have reviewed it.  Dumbest movie I have ever seen. Deserves to be studied an example of how bad movie can be.
This movie was like watching one of those old original movie from sci-fi channel
Stupid mindless is correct.. Just ridiculous now
But i rate 10 its a good movie
ya the movie is absolutely absurb but justin lin directed it well and its a fun time atleast
"The water heater is broken again." Dom : "A small price to pay for peace and quiet"
Still better than Army of the Death. Because Family!
After 5 they all feel like they are the same, just different villains. In this one, Dom didn't even feel like Dom. He was a Universal Soldier what the hell 😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
A C- that’s a high F or a D-
In fast 10 they would now bring undertaker as doms father
as much as i couldn't believe what i was watching and where they have taken this franchise, I would rather watch his a second time than the black widow movie. sheesh that was a boring movie, at least I got through this movie in 1 sitting and some laughs outta this.
F9 what can I say...it's really bad lost interest in the first 25 minute ..
they get inspiration from kollywood film
The funniest part is that the CGI when they have the Fiero blast into space was actually really good, giving the vibe of those NASA videos lol! (They even got the shockwaves lol) And they feature the An-148 :D
In fx they will truly be riding on moon.
they did explain what they did with brian.
Dom is a super soldier now. After him being Sportsmaster with a wrench I should have known, but come on. I can suspend my belief only so much. I mean damn.  I also like how Vin Diesel's range expanded a bit. His quiet one liners have gotten a bit louder as well as his screams.
This is the only movie I was pissed off I bought a ticket for. The whole time I was just waiting for it to be over
dont know where to start, out of space? seems like a nice start, smh.
Ok so we're all just gonna skip over the fact that these movies now work on Balayya physics?
Little Brian was with Big Brain
They're all superheroes at this point.
Brainless entertainment for  Brainless people. I enjoyed it .....Shit.
Spoiler: Dom soon to be recruited in the Avengers
the destroyed the franchise man.. i just want the crazy street racing and gangs war back :(
From race car to rocket science
It has to be called 'Fast your seat belt'
Fast 11 doms second cousin on his mother's side is looking for revenge for never being invited to the family cookout
I rolled my eyes at so many scenes that I started to get a headache
It’s not about family, it was about Paul and he died, franchise should have stopped there.
Can we talk about the fact that sean couldn’t even drift a car but now he can fly a plane which is A LOT more complicated 🤣
Honestly the best part for me was Tyrese talking about them being immortal somehow. For real. That scene where like 20 dudes shot him and bullets just magically dodge him was weird on purpouse. I actually thought the movie was going to get into the realm of insanity and say they are invincible for something sci fi-ish. It would have been actually interesting haha
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS IVE LEARN THAT MAGNET 🧲 WILL GET U THROUGH   TOUGH SITUATIONS
Just saw f9... And its a total HILIORISITY
A good movie will make you realise that u've wasted your 2 hours after it ends, a bad movie will tell you ur wasting your time.
FF - they dragged a safe thru streets, they shot down a plane, they jumped from a plane, they sink a submarine FF Fans: What will they do next???...... FLY TO SPACE? F9 producers: ... hmmm.... hold my beer  FF Fans: Ok, so they flew to space, what next????  F10: crew defeats Kang in Doctor Strange2: Multiverse of madness
Superhero comedy 🤣🤣🤣
You have to completely shut your brains off to enjoy F9. I went in there pretending that I never took a class of physics in my life and it worked.
One of or THE worst movies I have ever seen, ridiculous storyline, terrible acting, cars doing things that are impossible, oh and let’s not forget the Honda Civic they drove to space wearing scuba gear with paper thin windows. I give this huge slab of garbage a > 🥱    🙄     🥱.  The losers out there will cry that it’s about “Family”, give me a break, it’s about conning people out of money to watch their utter BS.
Don`t worry everybody is going to get bionic chips and turn into super-soldiers in F11 and try to stop Charlize Theron through the power of plot armor, street racing, and family...again.
This film wasn’t really that over the top I mean at this point in the franchise what do you expect although I will say that scene when Dom swings on a rope around a mountain like wow just wow
Godzilla is more believable than this movie!  AND CONSTANTLY INSULTED STAR WARS/YODA! LITERALLY HAD STORMTROOPERS WITH THOSE SHOOTOUTS!  Seriously.. fuck this movie!
Barrio Avengers.
F11 : refresh
And they were talking about Physics in it.
Yeah not gonna lie. I was uninterested while watching
the movie is just fucking dumb
I just saw it in the movie theater 5 minutes ago. I was laughing so hard the people around me looked pissed  I went into it watching it as a comedy
this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, I hope this is a joke !!!!!!!
Stop doing f10
F9 is as useless as the bullets fired up in this movie.
F9 has a chance for the best animated movie this year
Everyone's constantly giggling watching this movie 😉😉
It's was amazing as always 🤣
usa  u  🤭🤭🤭🤣🤣🤣 Sory   🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣 Supper 🤭🤭 Movi 🤣🤣 ❤❤❤
F9 is s pure garbage...😤💔
I hope we get the fast and furious vs the avengers next movie
Cringe
laughed hard after seeing this videos thumbnail, after watching the F9 movie i knew no one explain better than this.
I think Disney would by this series to expand their marvel universe.
I respect what they do in 7 for Brian. But keeping that character alive for franchises sake by just doing nothing and sometimes mentioning him doing absolutely nothing while the others going to literally space for the sake of family, it's literally disrespectful for his character and Paul's legacy
Good movie. I waited until it was online, and it was worth the wait. All in all, very exciting and a good emotional story. 8 1/2 our of 10.
The movie was eh for me. The director was Justin lee who created fast 5 and I liked the movie very much but man this movie was just a money grab. Everything felt forced. Oh another thing to add, it felt like avenger infinity war's opening 40 min
Didn't Like the movie ,not even a little bit.
F10 Riddick was in a coma for a century after getting defeated by Zhylaw. He realizes it was all a nightmare.
Fast and furious is just getting ridiculous . Out of space super powers. They should go back the basics racing , and high speed chases.
How'd the DK become a rocket scientist 😭😭😭
Paul Walker might have faked his death 🥺
hi
Yeah I was lost in this movie, the one before was passable. I think is going to be down hill from here like star wars 😑.
Brian was babysitting brian
This movie is a parody. Worst of the franchise.
It's all a simulation and the only character with a clue is Roman. Or they're dead. Or in a collective coma.
The most absurd part of the movie was Charlize Theron hair style.
Something is missing in the movie....
I'm disappointed that John Cena and dom didn't get a good fight scene. The whole time i was waiting for him To do AA
FAMILY
In F10 They're probably going to get superpowers and time travel to stop the franchise at fast 5
I can't stand Vin Diesel acting...cause he doesn't know how to act.  He is like a door in front of the camera staring at it saying FAMILY!
you said who was looking after little Bryan in the movie when dom and letty went off well you must of missed it but they did mention it when Mia showed up she said Bryan is looking after there own kid and little Bryan lol
Only logic  in this  movies is that spoil rich prick runs the world
Brian (Paul Walker) watched Brian. They said so. And FF was always a cartoon.
Dom :  Strength : Family Weakness: Family
little Brian was with brian(Paul Walker) they talked abt it
don't expect it to be emotionally powerful?? Mate i cried watching this from emotion!
They said Brian was with Brian 😂
Action movies are now the new comedy
I laughed....really hard when Dom fell into the water. My friends were a bit upset with me.  I think the lamp shading of their invincibility was a bit too on the nose. It took away more from the movie than it gave.
Please make a hilarioucity of this movie please!
The only two good things in this movie is Sean coming back, and they revealed who dom beat half to death with a wrench.
"F10: Out of Gas"
I agree they kinda lost me like I was all for the ride even with 8 and Hobbs and Shaw I was still on board but this one went down an odd path. I honestly found it hard to even focus it just felt like watching something go through the motions. They really need to get the old writer back as insane as he was at least he had method to his madness this movie just feels empty.
The look on your face in this thumbnail is pure wth did I just watch? and I am here for it.
you are the only movie critic that I pay attention to....and surely it is what I "bank" on when I go the the theater and what I rent/buy on video...your opinion for me matters...keep doing this even as you evolve as a director...you bring the fun to this...
Ridiculous, bro this movie sucks balls
Vin Diesel's entire wardrobe is wife beaters apparently
*family*
What happened to Briannnnnnnnnnnn!
The Tyrese stuff about questioning their immortality felt less like a self-aware excuse for the insanity and more like an incomplete plot line. I was literally just waiting throughout this whole movie for them to turn to the camera and realize they’re in a movie and for it to immediately turn out to be a fully meta fantasy story.
they're preparing us to flip our asses out showing that Paul Walker is alive on FX
My lord I just watched it in theaters and it is without a doubt the absolute worst movie Ive ever completed...The only redeeming part of watching this movie for me was I got a delicious Cookies and Cream candy bag at the concession stand
Just wanna mention about the little kid. Mia said that Brian was looking after the kids. Little Brian as well and her own
Hope they make f10 a little oldschool and real
I can’t wait for fast 23, when they will collab with the Scooby Doo gang.
I want to see them merge like Voltron in a future sequel
I see a lot of people humorously predicting the films to come, and I'm just saying to myself what a day it'll be when you see that all that shit is actually true.  Cipher has left for Mars and plans to conduct her experiments privately with the ambition to resize the earth so she can have it to herself. Now it's up to Dom and the team ...wait no, FAMILY, to stop Cipher in her tracks as they drive really fast cars in No Mans Land in a race against gravity and time. Because who needs limits when you got (you guys know). In "F-Xtraterestrial Crisis".  You've seen Fast, you've seen Furious but now it's time to see Fucked up.
Can’t wait till they join the mcu
Me who watches Tollywood and Kollywood movies : This is normal.
Its the damb white shirts Dom always wears. That's why he's invincible.
Who was baby sitting, tat will be revealed on f10.
F10:  Cipher is Dom's mother, but not Mia's or Jakob's.
The only place they could go is space.
Do people still not understand that this is a spoof franchise?
Omg, omg!!!! Letty never had child!
Fast 10 "Dom is Riddick"
And they were upset with Hobbs and Shaw.
Chris in your F6 review you said "they should go to space, why not!." And now they do and u hate it??? I'm sad.
Just came from watching the movie. I liked it. I never have any expectations for fast and furious movies. I’m kinda glad I didn’t have to think & I could just watch stuff blow up, this year has been hard enough 😂
They can't go to space cause there's a holly Dome and waters above, maybe a scuba diving. 😅😂😂🤣🔮🔮🔮
Are you not paying attention? Its been a cartoon since 4 and on. They are so terrible that they can't be fun to watch even just for fun. I can think of many more that are better.
fast five is shit ur trippin
it’s not even about racing bruh
5 is litterally so trash the first is the best
Fast and furious 20 be like: time to take over the 4th dimension
I didn't realize that Chris Morgan didn't write F9. And now I realize just how important he was to this franchise. I'm fine with F1-F8, but F9 really was ... not it. I hope Chris Morgan returns for the announced F10 & F11. This new guy ain't it, he doesn't even have that many writing credits to his name.
Honestly I'm expecting this movie and maybe even the last 4 movies to just be a dream
Spoiler Alert:   The problem with this movie was that they should have kept the villain the villain.  Having John Cena get betrayed by his financier was fine but they should have had Cypher save him in the end instead of Dom. Then they should have united in the sequels. Then part 10 and 11 could have been a 2 part movie called The Last Ride and they could have brought back Paul Walker's brothers who are on record as being willing to return so that they could film action scenes where Brian is now closer to Dom then his own flesh and blood brother who wants them both dead.
f9 is specially made for india and china ........
I still think Tokyo Drift is the best. Errr which one that one again?
f9 is the best in the series.
This movie was such a let down  They should of just stuck with racing since the first fast and furious
Next movie is called Fast10 your seatbelts.
That’s not their son
Ok they DID mention that Little Brian was being babysat by Brian, but I’m surprised that they gave us that much
This one was trash
Vin diesel doesn't need the back of his skull cause he has family 😂
People need to stop paying for these movies they are not entertaining just pure stupidity. It finished at 7 just give it up already.
This series is too dumb for me lol
fast 7 should have been the final one
God this crap is getting old now
Brian the kid was with Brian doesn’t it?
A few movies ago when vin diesel stomped on concrete and destroyed an entire multi level parking garage I was fine with not seeing anymore
Agree
Brian was babysitting Brian lol Letty told Dom when Mia showed up
Within 3 minutes, I was impressed that 1998 Pontiac Grand Prix stock cars existed 10 years earlier in 1989. Boy, that sure set the tone.
Dude this movie was worthless... nobody talking about "siphers Boy Cereal bowl  hair cut"   Lol everyone forgot to mention that or did he?
These films are garbage
This is what the review should have been in one sentence - made for children, and adults who enjoyed the previous ones should be embarrassed.
They didn't jump the shark, they jumped the whole freaking aquarium with this one. Ever since Fast 5 there's sort of been a deal. We agree to suspend our disbelief to a large degree, the filmmaker agrees to show us entertaining scenes we may have envisioned in our heads when we were kids. 'omg, imagine driving a car from one building into another building?!' kind of deal. In this one they did kind of lose me. I've seen the SpaceX developments over the years, going to space is a nightmare and costs hundreds of millions. I just can't get my brain to suspend ALL my disbelief. And like all memes, they're funny for at most 2 months, since the meme of them going to space is 7 years old it was DOA in terms of meme potential too.
Chris you've lost me with this one.  Have you not seen part 7 or part 8? Lmao.  They've been this ridiculous for awhile bro just didn't seem like you've accepted it even though you've articulated that you're aware of its self awareness.  I'm surprised because usually you get and dig genre films.
As long as it makes money, studio will keep mkg sequel or prequel because hollywood lack originality.
Trash movie, the worst one yet should of brought the rock back.
Fast 15.  Dom presumed dead but is actually a cyborg and must now collect all 7 dragon balls to wish Paul Walker back.
F9 was amaaaaazing! I thought this was going to be an original review, turns out it's a typical critic review 😬. Noone goes into a fictional movie believing it's meant to be realistic, that is the flaw of your insights, even if you keep denying it.  For the novelty changes this series required although grandeose, it was well done, the series itself is well past its shelf life, so doing something outrageous was the right call, making the same ol, same ol, is a losing formula if you keep doing it.  Bruh, your mom ever tell you to keep your mouth shut if you don't like something, and just pretend the vegetables taste amazing, same here 😂, it's all pretend nimbnuts.
The problem is, that the movie is in the middle part way too long
Family
This movie was sad and I think it ruined the franchise.. but they did say doms son was safe with Brian and mias kids
Fast 9 is the american version of bollywood.
I saw the movie with my gf, and throughout I kept thinking how funny it was. It was almost like a parody of what the fast and furious has become
I could listen to 4:07 to 4:20 all day
plot twist: Dom is going to take driving lessons and the whole franquise happens in his thoughts while he sits and dreams
I loved this one. Everything I want out of a Fast and Furious movie. They took the insanity up to 11 which is what I want to see and it didn’t disappoint. Some of the most fun I’ve had watching a movie this year.
Just came out if the Cinema and i thought i just seen the power rangers 😂
F9 is not a bad cartoon it's just plain bad garbage.
In F10, it will be revealed that Giselle isn’t dead and is actually Thanos
Can’t wait for Fast 10 your seatbelts
everything John Cena involved in is TRASH
FAST and Furious: 23 and me . Extended warranty and  Family.
They actually went to space.🤦🏻‍♂️
This series followed the foot steps of Need for Speed series. Sad!
Time travel coming in part 10 😅
Who needs logic when you got Family.
I think dom and the team should go back to robbing banks again.
😂😂😂
Smh not a single reffrence of family unsubscribing
They went to far this time.
Fyi Chris. Baby Brian and Brian O'Connor's son were with him. I guess you missed out when Mia told Dom that Baby Brian is with Brian O'Connor.
Watch fast and furious 1 and 2 then watch 9 😂
It would've been better without the space scene and more Cena and some story telling or flashbacks
They need make Fast 10 like Fast 5. F9 ( and I'm saying this as a fan of this franchise) was a horrible movie. 100% agree with this review. Hope that people making Fast 10 see this, and realize how many people weren't feeling it
Charlize Theron looks like Simple Jack in this movie.
I don’t know why but I lost it when I saw the picture of the F9 key
This Jurassic Park T-Shirt is dope
If Paul Walker hadn’t died these movies would’ve flopped already
Brian is babysitting the kids, his own and Dom’s
The Jurassic Park gate on your T-Shirt remind me of an Optimus Prime head.
People still pay money to watch this shit?
Brian, still alive in the movies, (Paul Walker) is watching baby Brian. They mention that in the movie.
at 2:31 you mentioned that they never explained what happened to doms son brian, getting close towards the end of F9 they did explain that brian oconner was looking after doms son and his own kids.
I mean, you start to run out of realistic ideas when at the start, the whole franchise is about dudes in cars stopping other dudes in cars
Ooooooo ooooooo ooooooooo ooooo uuuuuuu uuuu uuuu uuu uuuu huuu uuuuu uhu hu uuuu uu
F X?? 🤣🤣🤣
That Hey Arnold tat dope 💥
Review Tomorrow War
Theres actually a plot leak of fast 15 where dom and his family rob a bank in Gotham then some guy dressed like a bat chased them setting up the snyderverse.
No no. They explained it Chris. They said Little Brian was with Brian and Mia…and then just Brian when Mia joined the mission.
Ya don't need a good rating when you got family!
FX was a good suggestion for a name for the 10th installment. But I heard a good one before, "Fast 10 your seatbelts". That would be hilarious!
@2:31 Brian oconner took care of them
I know these films are not supposed to be taken seriously and just be a chill laidback cash-grab popcorn fun amusement park themed ride, however these plot lines are definitely getting a bit out of hand. Almost to the point where it’s noticeable and you have to stop and say to yourself “really bruh?!”. They should wrap up the main series with a concluding film and then just do a bunch of spin-offs like Hobbs and Shaw instead of constantly stretching out the entire saga to the point they literally go to fucking Jupiter and fight Godzilla.
Still gonna make half a billion or more.. sad
Chinese actor John xina spoke good English
They just ran out of idea's
At this point, I’m waiting on Kevin Feige to announce Fast & Furious as Marcel Canon. They are all super soldiers!
Rad t-shirt, Chris. Reminded me of a Jurassic Park NES video game, comics and a movie. Man, 90's, those were the years =J
"They called it a key stroke" LOL. No but seriously Chris is on to something.....We've used the term "jumped the shark" for decades maybe F9 has ushered in the need for a new phrase. What could it be??  Just call it the title? "Yeah the series just F9'd" Or do we go more creative with something more car related like "Yeah the series Pontiac Fiero'd" (the car with the rocket engine on it)  What do you think?
This movie is horrible
The most unrealistic thing aboit f9 is space because space doesn't exist
Worse part of this film... Is having Sean the so called DK (Drift King) of Tokyo  Now be a fucken rocket scientist.... no fucken connection what so ever to the story line of that movie and a fucken waist of a character... the movie would of been so much better if they showed him still ruling Tokyo as the DK... BUT NO they had to make them rocket scientist.... a guy who in the movie shows him taking auto classes in school.. And gives no fucks what so ever about school period... some how all the sudden his brilliant enough to design rockets
You just summarized all of Hollywood. I watch most fight scenes and I'm like, "yeah that dude is unconscious and probably dead by now"
They do say where the kids are, Brian  and mia's kids are with Brian (Paul walker) because he is "retired" not dead
The movie was beyond Silly!
The entirety of F 11 is just gonna take place on Pluto or something I guarantee it
You just wouldn't understand the point of fast and furious, the characters get stronger because they have the power of family
Never been a fan of these movies, but they should've stopped at 7. They really didn't need to continue this franchise after Paul Walker's death.
Is this already out? Dam im missing a lot
Why is the Reverse Cowgirl illegal in Alabama ???   Cause you don’t turn your back on Family.
F10 plot Johnny Tran comes back after it was revealed he didn’t die after all and Jesse comes back to except he’s a cyborg like the edris Elba character
yeah I miss the style of the first 5 movies, feeling a little more grounded and in a community with enough absurdity to be believable but awesome, especially 1,2 and tokyo drift (my favorite). But I am glad Han is back, Han is awesome.
Dom’s charger is actually an Autobot, that’s the reason why he’s able to drive it anywhere he goes. Even in the mountain area and jumping off cliffs with secret weapons to shoot harpoons.
Yeah, as soon as they were about to blow whoever came up the driveway away with a shotgun I was like nope, I'm out. You really have to be in the mood for absurd Americanisms and I just wasn't so I watched Black Widow instead which was much better. Maybe later.
What’s with all the cursing on this review. It doesn’t help it at all.
Internet: Family memes. Cinemasins: Hahahahahahahahahah *gasp* Hahahahahaha
The fight between Dom and his brother is weaker than Dom Vs Hobbs, but it seems like it might be intentional. Subconsciously, each brother is trying to end the fight asap. That's kind of how brothers fight🤣they just want to end the fight. Dom and Hobbs seemed to enjoy inflicting damage on each other. Or maybe it is just a crap fight. 😂 Great review as usual 👍
If you see the fast and furious series as a superhero franchise, it's infinitely better.
Fast and Flanderisation  9
Went to see it on acid. A+
Who cares about absurdity when you have family
They do talk about where baby Brian was. He was with adult Brian. Mia says that when she first shows up.
I also love the fast and the furious franchise but this absolutely lost me. I laughed during the entire movie and not good laughing lol
Little Brian was being watched by big Brian. Mia told Dom that. It's how the film justifies not having Paul Walker, but having Mia there.
In fast and furious 74 the team has to fight Thanos who is also doms long lost uncle from space
Fast and furious 9 is good and have emotional scene. One thing I love about this movie is family !
The family vs Jumanji.
Plz stop making this crap. Where's Megatron?
This is just Vin Diesel using Hollywood as an excuse to take his buds on expensive as fuuuuuuck vacations. Adam Sandler does, lots of folks do it.
Don’t be surprised if dom and the gang team up with the avengers to beat thanos or another “huge” and “powerful” super villain in another galaxy.
Anyone know where Chris gets his shirts ? This one is pretty sweet !
2:35 Family
It is absurd that people watch this garbage.
After the 1000 mile long airstrip in fast 6 I was done lol, these movies are trash IMO
FX?? I’d prefer “fast10 your seatbelts” tbh
I see you are wearing a Jurassic park T-Shirt. Are you hinting of a Fast and Furious crossover?
I actually fell asleep, it was so shit
I lost interest in this franchise a few years ago, who cares the newness has worn off.
I checked out when Dom got super strength and fought a thousand trained mercenaries
It won't be long til F&F movies can challenge Bollywood action movies
Ciper is thanos
I can't even believe there are 9 fast and furious movies
I gave up on the FF when F8 came out. Felt like F7 was the perfct ending.
It was so bad
Fast 15 where every corporation in america is now all the companies in Cyberpunk
I'm sorry but after seeing Cena grovel before the CCP I wouldn't pay a cent to watch anything he is in ever again.
The solution to everything in this movie was “TURN THE MAGNETS ON” and boom.
Great review I give 8/10 it had good storyline and action scenes but their a lot foolishness like going out space& Don surviving explosion
They do say Brian is babysitting Brian
F9.........is a freaking cartoon now.  Wtf is going on?!? Please stop at 10
I can't wait for Fast 37👨🏽‍🦳👵🏼
The worst Fast, they should really stop
'Tire collection' really cracked me up xD.  When I first sat down for this movie the lack of realism started to bother me quickly, thinking how many times a character should have died already, but thankfully I set it aside soon and just enjoyed it for what it is.
Yeah totally agree with your take, it’s just become ridiculous and much less entertaining, I enjoyed this far less than previous movies.
Chris, you barely laugh during your reviews so I know this movie is bananas! 😂😂😂
The last scene with Brian and his iconic skyline was honestly the saving grace for me.
Dom is in a coma from fast 1 after that train cash and all of this is just a dream
For those who despises this series, here are the budgets for these trash films:  FF1: 38 Mil FF2: 76 MIll FF3: 85 Mil FF4: 85 Mil FF5: 125 Mil FF6: 160 Mil FF7: 190 Mil FF8: 250 Mil FF9: 200 Mil   Over a fucking billion fucking dollars spent on trash!  Meanwhile, people are living in tents on the streets of California.
My favorite will always be F&F 1. After Toyko Drift the Saga died for me.
Absurdity overload though
Wee Brian was with big Brian so they said later in the film
@1:35 CHRIS: I love absurdity but this movie is laughable, it is 100% a cartoon. It's the closest to hilariosity that this franchise has ever gotten. ME: We will expect a hilariosity video on this movie, Chris.
They should have called this one "Furious Backstory."
I didn't like this film, and 8 agree some scenes wer funny
If the next movie isn’t called Fast10 your seatbelts I’m going to be furious
For one cipher didn't recruit them she was kidnapped as well and then struck a deal with one if them after.  Also they told you that Brian was with Paul Walker's character who is alive it's character who is alive in the series
Just saying, in fast five they literally pulled the safe through a building irl, that was genuinely done, this franchise died with Paul and it's time Vin Diesel accepts that, the fanboy in me cried inside while watching this shitty film. I am still struggling to find something I liked about this film. I didn't like 8 however some of that film was okay. 7 was still ridiculous but Paul and the comedy made it entertaining, 6 was the last one I genuinely enjoyed and still enjoy, 5 is great for me, I love it. 4 is a classic that I watch occasionally. I got home from this film and put on the original Fast and Furious whole rubbing my temples to sooth myself.
Do you make videos without getting prepared for it??  You even can't explain properly?
Yeah I remember everyone was saying how ridiculous it would be if every next fast installment did this and did that, and now they’re actually doing it. Lmaoooo. They’re going to space next. Or was that this one? I didn’t watch  Edit: I finished the video. Yes..yes..they did
I love that shirt 😆
Anyone else just want a Tokyo drift 2 ?
I laugh when he laughs. 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤍
u obv didn’t pay attention to the movie bc brian(paul walker) was taking care of his kids and brian
“Plot” for FX: Mark Whalberg is Cypher’s husband (the Italian job reference) and comes to rescue her/seek vengeance on the family or…. Someone else’s family member comes to wreck havoc. Most likely anyone else’s twin 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
dude, they've been laughable since the 5th one. They have been pure shit since the 5th one. Before the 5th they were ok but after the 5th pure laughable shit. God almighty where do you get your taste in movies?? Sorry buddy
They need to go back in time, To the streets of LA 1960s “Fast to The Future”
they mentioned where his son was letty basically looked at th camera and said “he’s safe… with brian” thats how mia was there as well
This movie seemed to go quicker than the rest.  Plus I can't even remember the plot of the middle part of the movie. I dont know how it got to the end
Whenever the franchise is finally done, it’ll end with all being a dream. Dom is still sitting in jail after beating the dude with the wrench 😂
I got so baked and went to see this with a friend (I’ve never seen any of the fast movies) I laughed so hard. It was such a good bad movie.
This movie is entertaining, and I got a good laugh.
I think the expression is "jumping the nuclear submarine". See F8 for details
I went into this expecting it to be 100% an absurd cartoonish comedy.  Smoked a j before going in which helped a lot.  I was laughing my ass off for most of the movie.  You're absolutely right, the Cena v Diesel fight was WEAKSAUCE
Fast 10 will definitely be some back to the future type stuff (in Doms charger) with a sprinkling of star wars father son drama lol
I honestly view this entire series as a completely
Let's be real, Fast and Furious has always been balls to the wall
IT WAS TRASH!!!!
Yea this movie SUCKED
i cant believe you didnt state the obvious.....they really ruined it by bringing in Cena.
I still remember the hype about the first one 20 flipping years ago. Damn.
Ah yes, Jakob Toretto... the one they've never mentioned before in the series despite it all being about family.
I loved the flashback scenes more than anything. Can’t even lie, this movie was pretty decent though. I feel like it is unique in the way the plot unfolds.
Only watch the first two films. And the last of Paul Walker. Personally didn't care . Of the rest of the franchise...
Can anyone explain why my Facebook gaming group is now inundated with Vin Diesel??
This movie was garbage absolutely trash.
Family is everything!
F9 is basically Sharknado with a bigger budget.
I I don't know this one kind of lost me 7:22
Baby Brian was with Brian
At one point of watching it , my bf started laughing and said it was a cartoon and fell asleep and I ended up being on my phone for the last 30 mins. Boring af
F11 about to just be a crossover with cyberpunk
When they went to space....I was waiting on Optimus Prime🤷🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
honestly, I get the mindless over the top blockbuster fun, but there are limits to everything, when the story is nonsensical, characters shallow and humor off the mark then no amount of quality CGI will get me engaged or invested
For me... Tokyo Drift is the best movie in the entire franchise.
This movie was terrible people, who are we kidding? Sure it was nicely directed but it was so horrible. Made me wanna never watch another fast and furious movie again
He should watch bollywood action movies to understand how 'grounded' the absurdity of this franchise actually is.
It's like John Wick... sometimes crazy fun is all you need
Where was the rock ?
So, its basically like a bad bollywood movie this time.
Baby Bryan was with Bryan they said it grate review they lost me too
Tokyo Drift by far is my favourite.. & the sound track still legit this day..
Why just give it a C-? This movie was trash and I am a fan of this franchise. I have the tire collection too.
F10 they will go to Mars!
diesel talks so much about family, yet every family member wants to kill him😆
Fast 10: Your Seatbelts
I just got back from watching it. It was my first fast and furious movie and I loved it. I’m definitely going to watch the rest.
I'm a big fan if the fast franchise but f9 was so boring imo
C- mad
lmao these comments😂 but they’re ending it at 10 there will be two parts to it
Dude. They say right in the dialogue that Brian Jr is with his Uncle Brian. It's how  they explain Paul Walker being gone, while at the same time explaining where the kid is. How are you a "movie critic"?
Fast 10 “La Décima”  We will find out that Dom’s parents are actually Hobbs & Shaw. He grew up with two fathers, that’s why he’s so big on family and he hates busters.
i love the fast and furious saga I mean if u don't like it don't watch it I guess 👍
Fast and furious kinda turned into assassin’s creed , the identity is kinda being lost and confusing.
And people say that Saw series is bullshit
Worse fast movie ever made they need to live it alone 1-2-3 the best out of the fast series!!!✌️✌️✌️
Family > physics.
F10 Dom is a Cyborg that can transform into a car
Omg poor Charlize Theron with that bowl cut.
What made me almost walk out was when Dom turned the charger he was driving into batman by swinging across the damn canyon on the rope....I got a feeling Michael Knight and KITT will show up in the next movie.
Family it is.
I stopped watching them after 7
Hated this movie. Regret not walking out. But to miss that Bryan was the one babysitting his kids and little Bryan is a big miss.
I saw it yesterday with 2 other people in the theater. I think this franchise has reached "direct to dvd" territory.
Let’s get together fans, and get the fast family into the MCU.
not one mention of the longest zipline in history?! i'm disappointed stuckmann
Speaking of invincible I wanted him to review Invincible especially episode 8
By far the worst of the series. John Cena was boring, nothing but *look at my face, I am so angry.*  And the story...my God it was awful. The action is not exciting, it's just stupid over the top shait. And don't even get me started on Charlize Theron. The most annoying wannabe scary villain with the most stupid female haircut in the history of haircuts.  I like Tyrone, tho. And his buddy, the one he goes to space with.  But I missed Dwayne Johnson and Jadon Statham.   I'm giving this movie a rock solid *D*
🏎.……………🛻💨💨💨💨
Next Movie will be called F X Jurassic Park. And seeing you wear that shirt.  I know that's what you want.
Even rock had a badass fight scene before he got good terms with dom.  But seriously you got John Cena and not even a badass fight scene? You might as well got Rick Flair to be the brother..  Real let down. Fast 9 is soo PREDICTABLE.
Now there is no difference left between sharknado saga and fast saga.. it's time for them to collab 😌
“I’m Luke friggin skywalker”
They just need to stop.
Fast and Furious 9: Magnets 🧲
If you think THIS is a joke. Check out the ride at Universal Studios Orlando. The first so bad its good ride.
You did not just say 5 and 6 are your favorites
After fast 7, Fast and furious has been in a simulation
The free frame alternately mate because pantyhose ethically queue unlike a flat list. lamentable, alive scissors
They went up into orbit in old diving suits and a Pontiac Fiero, LOL. Radiation would be a problem, as those old diving suits don't protect against that.
I like the first 8.  The story made sense up until 7. This was not good at all.
I walked out during the flashback with gal gadot
This should be a hilariocity for sure.
You weren’t paying attention to the movie, everything in the movie had an explanation and lil Brian was with the OG Brian.
As a wrestling fan, I'm usually used to suspending my disbelief to enjoy over- the-top absurdity; but I had enough of this series after the 6th one. Turns out Cena is a better actor than Vin Diesel- not setting the bar particularly high though.
This movie was soooooooooooooo stupid. And not in a fun way
Fr ,it's like they got super serum ‽‽
remember when the where stealing dvd players?
Can’t wait till Fast and Furious 14 - all the way they can do stunts in their chairs.  P.S. This movie sucked!
The movie should be called Fast and Family cuz that’s all they talk about
Fast and the Furious can go to Space, Ocean, Dessert, and even the Earth's core, through the Power of Family.
Bruh I’m suprised these niggas didn’t fight thanos cuz family
It sounds like they wanted to use Deadpool as the new way to make an crazy joking action movie with cars.
The Onion's review of Fast 5 applies even more to this movie.
Wow I would of never thought you I'm surprised of the way you're treating this movie I was not expecting you to be so nice to this franchise LOL
Considering this guy starts the video saying "Cipher enlists Dom's brother" shows he didn't really pay attention. He also asks "Who's taking care of Brian" when Dom's sister made it very clear that both their children are under the care of Paul Walker's Brian.
His review on the movie was strong...  but not as strong as Family...
They screwed up the fucking film
Fuck F9
Taiwan Number 1
When the sister showed up she said the kids were with Brian you usually are better than this
Fans will be like- "Look how the massacred my boy".
Fast Franchise trying to transform into their own MCU (FCU?).  As in....FC U to the OG fans?  LMAO
Even my 11 year old brother told me just 35 minutes or so into the movie that we could leave if I wanted too
Fast 11  The revelation is Dom has been strapped to the same machine from the (1990) Total Recall movie since The Fast and the Furious.
well  there will be two  more  films  so this film is basicly  a set up for most likly a setup for a finale
this finally ended  my  ability to watch new films in this  saga for me i will now end them on rewatches  with 8
This franchise is.....Ludacris!!!!!
Might as well make another xXx... Xander Cage is back XD
Come on Chris!  This totally should have been a hilariocity. It's been too long. This was the perfect set-up!
They did say that Brian was watching the kids for Mia and Dom which I understand it’s a way to keep Brian in the franchise
Next movie fasten your seat belts.
Mexican kids can survive on their own.. it is known.
Man after 5 I just told myself when seeing a fast movie I'm just seeing it for the action and crazy ass scenes not going into them expecting amazing story but this was good
Go see it as a action/comedy and have a good time
They did explain where the kid was
If Chris Morgan comes back in fast 10 and part 2 then it's should be able to fix some?
You said everything I thought
How can you all still go and watch this trash? After the 4th it was done. (some might say after the 2nd). There was the last real race, when Braga was hiring.
The franchise died with Paul Walker, RIP
Spoiler alert: Roman gets chased by militants and some how none of them kill him and he basically killed them it was like a 20 v 1, and Vin Diesel fought off like 50 men by himself. Also Roman and Ludacris are the most climatic moment of the whole movie lol they “sacrifice” themselves by crashing into a satellite and destroy it by exploding on impact, but they cut to the next scene and they are PERFECTLY FINE, the flying car is untouched by the satellite explosion 😭
I’m convinced the Fast & Furious cast can take on the Avengers
The one with Statham lost me. Now I don't know how to feel about Chris joining me here :|
F10 Dom obtains a time travel device. Turns out he is his own Dad. F11 A mix between Fast cars and Spy Kids.
The next movie better be called 'Fast10 Your Seatbelts' or it was all for nothing
Man, this movie made me miss the entertaining presence Rock adds to these movies. If it wasn't for Tyrese and Ludicrous...I would have nodded off various times. Vin Diesel is becoming the new Bruce Willis.  It amazes me that Ludicrous outacted him in one scene...LUDICROUS.  No, the joke is not lost on me.
Hello, Chris. Heads up, this might be a bit lengthy.   3 things first of all 1. I have been a long time fan. I love your reviews and descriptions on all videos you publish.  For the most part, I still watch any movie regardless of getting a bad review on your behalf, but usually if it's a good review, it really helps me get hyped for any particular movie. I find myself usually agreeing with what you state on any other film I've watched in the past and then watch you discuss it afterward. 2. I very rarely comment , I'll admit. Usually I just watch, enjoy,  and leave behind a "like". 3. Obviously I understand how busy you must be and how much demand for any particular movie review you must receive... having said that last part, I'll get to the point. Oh, btw I may leave this comment on several videos of yours to hopefully ensure it gets to you: Apologies in advance if it's an inconvenience.     For as long as I can remember my favorite movie genre other than drama has been the TIME TRAVEL genre. From classics like Back to the Future to modern sci-fies such as Looper and even The Butterfly Effect (not necessarily time travel,  but it's used throughout the film).  Back in 2007 I watched a spanish film called "Los Crono Crimenes" or "Time Crimes" as it was translated in the USA. I haven't watched the movie in a couple of years but I remember being obsessed with it for a really long time.  I would dare say it's become one of my favorites.  The movie is a slow burner and very low budget , but in my opinion the story and twists in the film have a great pay out and keep you on edge. The movie is originally in spanish but it is subtitled in English and it's free on several streaming platforms including Amazon Prime. .. I'm not trying to sell the movie in anyway, sorry about the rant, but my point is : I would really love and tremendously appreciate if in any spare time of yours, you might be able to watch this film ( only about 90 minutes long) and give us your thoughts on it. I really would like to hear what you might have to say about it and hopefully go on the radar for  most of your fanbase , considering you actually DO enjoy it.       As I mentioned earlier,  I know you must be very busy with your own projects and I'm sure the requests keep on coming,  but it's only because we appreciate your thoughts on the films we love. So if it ever is something you work on, it'll be truly appreciated from a great fan who took some time to recommend and request this from you. Thank you so much and Please keep making these videos 😊
On god they’re going to somehow take the super soldier serum in the next movie
you clearly didn't pay attention lol in the movie they did say baby brian was being bay sitter by brian aka paul since he isn't clearly alive moran
C- Is very generous when reviewing trash
I stub my toe on the bed post and I'm down for the count
Brian was babysitting little Brian
I wish you made this review a hilariocity video
Fast and furious 10-Don’t get done …get dom.
Damn Chris they said they left the babies with Brian, if you missed that can you really critique a film 🤔
When u described vin diésel going through the  door way I got a head ache thinking about how it would feel to actually have that happen lol
The only character that can never come back is Brian
Inception and Interstellar are more possible than F9
The Fast And Furious Franchise is basically a shonen series at this point.
only the first one and the one in tokyo and the one in brasil and hobbs and shaw it was entertaining
I miss the street racing aspect… take me back to the 2fast2furious days
It’s honestly sad to see what the Franchise turned into. In the beginning it was actually about cool cars. I’m surprised Vin Diesel let it come to this but I suppose the money was there. Sad
I think dom needs to go the blackhole in the next movie.
the most loyal and fan of the F9 is speechless now Lol
So is this movie a joke skit? I'm kinda lost. Somebody please help me on this.
Fx works but hear me out... fas10furious 😂
This movie was perhaps the dumbest of them all. But, I knew what I went in for, and was not disappointed.
Brian was being babysitted by Brian
4:47
How about the fact that they ruined the Tokyo Drift characters for us? They acted dumb and ridiculous... Shawn was so cool in TD😔
The plot is goldeneye007
Made by people of low IQ for the people of low IQ.
0:43 that laugh. That beautiful laugh.
The jagged mary unsurprisingly roll because steven technically warn excluding a unaccountable organ. enthusiastic, verdant feeling
I wish that they start using ACME products in the next one
Horrible movie
Slight correction, they did infact explain that Brian (Paul Walker's character) was babysitting the kid. I can understand the confusion as they have the same name. I don't even know how I paid enough attention during the film to catch that.
Chris, at some point, this needs to be a hilariacity in the future 😭😭
I am shock that everyone only complain the unrealistic physics, but not the never ending ending.
I believe it's quite clear that Chris took this movie very serious 🤣 to even think that this is the definition of why people go to the movies.
nothing of a movie
Although I agree that the fnf was never a movie to be taken serious, you do know Brian was in the care of Brian o Conner right? It says when Dom doesn't want mya to tag along on their objective.
I hate this franchise but I respect those who disagree
2:27. yes they did. Mia or Letty literally said Brian taking care of the kids
They said that doms kid is with Brian
Was a great movie and proper action start to finish
They can do whatever they want with the 'Fast' movies, just don't give another haircut to a character like Charlize Theron - omg bald women look more sexy.
It's getting old this family 💩
You don't give up on family.....8 movies later Dom has a younger brother!!! 😂
Brian was with Brian they said that at the beginning of the movie.
Fast and furious characters go to hell to rescue doms dad in a special machine before shaw has a chance to recruit him.
The only good one was the first. The rest are absolute trash.
4:30 vin diesel is a steel wall, idk what you're talking about
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 Bomboclaat mon
The fact that you enjoyed any of these trash movies cements your lifelong disconnection from reality.
I had a great time watching this movie but it's certainly the worst one I've seen since Tokyo Drift. John Cena's character Jacob was the only character I wanted to see more of and learn more about his backstory outside of being Dom's brother. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets his own spin-off to explain where he has been leading up to Fast9... Knowing that ten will be a two part movie, I can't imagine what the fuck they have planned for those... Aliens? Giant robots? Time travel?
Is brian dead really? Brian: wait for FX
FX will reintroduce Giselle and they be fighting Guardian of the Galaxy
Space is a joke lol
Brian was babysitting Brian. Mia said that to Dom in her first scene
When I saw them flying into space I knew I would never watch this movie again I laughed so hard when I saw that
Director offast 9 is probably indian. Fast and furious have become an indian movie
Fast 11 They use the infinity stones to fight Dormammu.
Yea I could suspend my disbelief for most of the other movies but this one went too far lol. Physics was just nonexistent a lot of the times, The plot armor is so thick that they pretty much are invincible and joke about it, and Dom is pretty much Captain America at this point. Like he has to have some sort of super-soldier serum to survive all he did and display the inhuman strength he did lol.  But yea in terms of the movie it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either, just meh. John Cena's character didn't live up to the hype and he barely had any badass moments. Plus the fight was short and weak with John Cena losing most of it. I don't blame John Cena specifically cause he did a good job but the writing for him was just poor. Also besides John Cena all the other villains were weak. Just Cypher and just bratty rich dude. So yea, it feels like they gotta go back to the drawing board cause things are kinda going downhill again. Fast 8 was just Okay and now this is just  Meh.
Fast 10, they fight zombies!
Man this film was better then what I expected I thought it was gonna be horrid but the action was solid enough not to care about the story Dom is still Dom
Stop bro. I've seen two of those movies and it was enough. But once I heard that they brought Cardi B into this, now I know exactly who they're making those movies towards.
They're the Turbo Power Rangers.
Starting to think that the people saying 9 jumped the shark also just genuinely believed that the crazy things that happened in 1-8 were actually possible.
I just watch the review so I don't have to watch these ridiculous films. Don't feel like I'm missing much.
2:41 a quiet place reference? 🤔
It makes me happy knowing that I haven’t seen any of these movies.
This franchise should've ended with Furious 7
I hit the "Three Stooges" point in Fast and Furious 3.
I assumed that they left bryan with mia but then she randomly appeared
I had that question too on where their son was. I think they did briefly mention that he is safe with Brian. Still a ridiculous though haha
So this is in fact a secret sequel to Top Secret! Wow I am in.
Fast 10 is gonna be like they put Brian in a DNA test or something and it turns out he was really the resurrected soul of the Brian O'connor. However, since the news got leaked, a cult from outer space that sees Brian O'connor as the messiah of the End of Earth tries to kidnap him which then sets Dom and his crew on a mission to uncover the truth and prevent the kidnapping of his son.
Fast 10 meets Avengers. Guaranteed
The first 3 were the best.
The entire time I was watching the movie all I could think of was getting home to watch your review of it.
Watched it yesterday in a Dolby Cinema, and actually was bored, also the film could have been 15-20 min shorter and the money saved from that could have been put into the writing,  but yeah, that is what 8 sequels has brought use to. The next flick I wanna see dino’s dragracing.
It’s time to end the saga. You cannot hide the wrinkles of Mia and Letty for too long.
They should have gone back to the original fast and furious and Tokyo drift style movies
I liked this movie but I think they did too much commenting on how they survive crazy stunts by joking about it. We go to watch these films for the silliness and action but I don’t need the films to be self aware like that. It kind of ruined the fun. But I didn’t like 8 so they feel back on track (no pun intended) with 9.
I haven’t seen any of these since the second one.  Why wasn’t Paul Walker mentioned?
But of a shit review they clearly said in the film that young Brian was with older Brian
correction: “Brian Jr” was not Leti’s son, just Dom’s and Brian was babysitting the kids.
F10 probably take place on 4th dimension
Next there going to resurrect Jesus
My favorite line of the movie is, "as long as we obey they laws of physics, we'll be fine"
I e seen the first one, half of the second one like 3 times, and the one in Tokyo. I definitely checked out forever after that. Kinda liked the first one. Didn’t like the other two I kind of saw.
Movie was awesome. I go to the movies to get away from real life.  Awesome review but I loved this movie.
I just want to see the CinemaSins video for F9. I'm more excited for that than I'd ever be for these BS films.
Fast 5? The original The Fast And Furious is the best, without question.
You enjoy watching this yet you can’t get past the fact that you can’t understand what Luca’s family does. Ok Chris.
Brian was being baby sat by Brian they did explain it
F10  They use cars that can drive under water, and they find the Lost City of Atlantis.
Plot Twist: Dom and others have avoided dying because they are mutants that have accelerated healing factors.
Remember when Fast and the Furious movies were about illegal street racing.
Fast 6 was the one with the tank, i do remember that now LOL! XD
This movie was BUNS!!!!! Straight ridiculous!!!!!
I now get it. THEY ARE TRYING TO SET UP THAT FAST AND FURIOUS TAKES PLACES IN THE X-MEN UNIVERSE AND THEY ARE ALL MUTANTS !!!! I HAVE SOLVED IT XD
totally dissected Black Widow but this is not spoken about for the trash that is is?
They said that baby Brian was being watched by adult Brian.
Brian was watching Brian
Say what you will about F9, but it gave us one of the most entertaining Stuckman reviews.. EVER, and for that, I am grateful.
I thought "CAts" was shit , the new number 1 now !!!!
There wasn't enough cars in the movie IMO. I would have loved to see more swaps of cars like they've done in the past.
I still haven't seen one of these movies...
Fast Ten - Your seatbelts
The guy who won’t shut up about family has a long lost brother he’s never mentioned?
The Florida man's Casablanca
I'm with you on this one, Chris.
You know, everything you're saying about this one is pretty much exactly how I felt about 7 and 8.   7 in particular felt more self-aware, constantly winking at the audience, and almost 80s action movie-like than any of the other ones, I thought. It just really leaned heavily on the cheese. Whether you're into that or not is another matter.
Didn’t Brian O’ Conner take care of little Brian. I thought that’s what Mia and Letty explained to Dom.
F9 is the greatest WTF film in history ever lol
They were definitely The Avengers lbs. Full parody mode lol I laughed through the whole thing
I stopped at 7.
"If they don't call it FX, i dunno what the fuck they're doing." The way he said it xD it reeked of disappointment hahahahaha
THANK YOU FOR QUESTIONING THE WHEREABOUTS OF LITTLE B RIAN! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Throughout the whole movie, I wondered, "What happened to Little Brian before Mia was brought into the story? Dom and Letty live in the middle of nowhere, almost completely off-grid. Not close neighbors. Not close to friends. And the flight was scheduled for 8am! What happened to Little Brian? I'll take the space nonsense. I'll take the magnetic cars nonsense. I'll take the long lost brother nonsense. I'll take the Cardi-B nonsense. Just tell me who was taking care of Little Brian!" LOL
Havent seen your review yet, but I saw this in the theatre and wouldnt go back if someone paid me to
Fast and furious 10 can't be FX. It has to be fas10 your seatbelts
The movies are stupid and change the universe rules without justice. Imagine watching Breaking Bad and then Walter White starts doing Harry potter spells out of nowhere
Popcorn movie.
It’s crazy how Hobbs and Shaw will beat this movie in Records.
Honestly, the modern F&F are not bad movies. It's just crazy to think we went from illegal street racing, to heists, to doomsday missions, and flying a car in space. It just doesn't feel like a F&F movie.
Movie executives thought if Han wasn’t in the new film it wouldn’t connect with the East Asian market.
Sounds like you just need a hug Chris
You knew exactly how ridiculous this movie was going to be when an entire squad had Tyrese surrounded(with goons above him as well) and yet somehow not a damn one can hit him while he manages to gun like 12 guys down.!
There was a line of dialogue that said that Brian was taking care of little Brian and the other kids. I’m pretty sure Jordana Brewsters character said it when she first came on screen.
I just saw the movie. They actually said that ex cop Brian was babysitting kid brain
I agree, diesel vs xena was weak... I expected at least the level of f5 when the rock fought diesel ..
They r missing chris morgan... He did a great job, the reason how Han is back... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
They did say that Brian was babysitting all the kids, incl little B
I had the same man, they also lost me in f9 😅😅😅 story was tooooooo much even for me, fight choreo had so much cuts and shaky camera, horrible, and lets not talk about the space shit 🤦‍♂️
Watch it twice it gets better! It's the best comedy movie about Family.
Where can they go after SPACE? Underwater lol
They used to do illegal street racing so everything in this movie checks out.
After watching g every new FF movie I rewatch Tokyo Drift
Yeah by the time they get to 11 theyll probably go to the underworld or a parallel universe or something. I dont mind. If its fun, its fun
4:18 almost as hard as pat bevs forehead lol
Fast 10. Fast to the Future. Time travel.
i thought John Cena would be in the movie but i didn´t see him...
Brian was with Brian doms sister said he watching them .
I loved the fast and furious movies but they fucked up bad like it’s embarrassing smh
Seems like Hollywood has made 'Radhe' from Bollywood in English. Wait...F9 still better 😂😂 And moreover thanks for telling not to watch it. 😂
These films a now being catered to the mentally handicapped.
I haven’t watch one of these movies past number 5 and that was even forgettable. Can’t believe you said you like these movies.. I’d rather watch the transformer franchise or struggle thru the end of the last couple Harry potters. The first 2 were so cult classic and now they arent good or funny or cool.. just a cash grab for Hollywood.
Just seen it ,it wasn't that over the top ridiculous as stuckman put it out to be ,the most ridiculous was the space thing but that's about it ,its a movie at the end of the day it's not supposed to be 100% accurate, as a matter of fact no blockbuster movies are so if your expecting accuracy on a summer blockbuster movie your lost ,take it for what it is it's worth the admission
This review is my spirit animal.
Very polite with a c-... hands down the worst installment. We almost walked out. I hope little B still isn't in that box, he is so cute!
My question is how did we get to this, from just a street dude, who likes to race and barbeque in the beginning, like the series wasn't originally supposed to be like this, but it got huge and went overboard 😅😅, none of the characters or story lines every make sense from movie to movie lmao, but atleast Lucas black is back the series about time
They did explain that little Brian was being babysat by big Brian
Bryan was with Bryan.
NAh, I don't want to turn my brain into a vegetable so I spend money to enjoy a dumb movie. Stop giving these trash franchises money!!!!
I just watched the movie last night and it was so completely and utterly over the top that I couldn't quite get into it, what a total fucking pantomime.
Haven't seen the movie yet but damn would it be meta if they would somehow turn this into somekind of anti-hero superhero franchise xD I mean Tyrese is right over time they became more and more superhuman and now they can't go back (atleast storywise).  And atleast that would be something no one has ever done before... maybe for a good reason though :D
I don't understand why am I hearing so many complaints regarding logic... Dom was shot and didn't react at all previously, he broke the fkn floor, last movie the rock manually deviated a missile... I need to watch it, but I think maybe critics just want to not like it
how many times did Vinny Diesel say " FAMILY" ??
they might as well go to space at this point. they are all the best at everything they do, and are basically super heros
They need side movies and keep the original. I was thinking when they brought Jason Stratham in that it would be almost like death race x fast and the furious.
i love( also makes me insane) how they always have to drive their own car. OH HERE COMES 13 CARS!
its just a matter of time vin diesel would grow a hair & turn super Saiyan, it all made sense
A Jurassic Park shirt... We all know why
Hans death was faked by mr nobody because of project Aries I fell asleep in the middle so I kinda could be wrong
Vin Diesel is old and overweight. What do you expect?
When John Cena gets pushed off the truck and hits his back on a car, then he perfectly lands on another car... I laughed so hard in the theater, probably annoyed the people in my audience but holy shit... they lost me when they did that.   But another one is when they look at a camera footage and which only Dom is the one who freeze frames the footage while there's two high end hackers who could do that...?   I don't know just know I laughed so hard in the theaters which doesn't happen so often..
F9 is trash
2:40 he said it in the movie brian was babysitting him
The inconsistency of all the Fast titles is what truly stumps me.
Vin diesel : “all my life I thought my fast and furious movies were action movies. Now I realize they are comedies”
You can REALLY feel in this movie that the fast and furious franchise is running out of ideas.
Intentionally deep, raspy voice: Family.
That's why it was released in IMAX no?
Fast 9 kinda made me clueless and I wonder what were they thinking? Tho I do like the movie but it could've gone better
This felt like a parody. Very disappointed, they should have finish it on 6.   It might sound silly but I was heartbroken by the end of this movie. I wish they would have added some deleted scene of Paul Walker at the end of the movie.
Fast Family vs Avengers Let's fucking do it.
I just saw this movie it was like watching a live action cartoon lol
Brian is babysitting Brian 🤣🤣🤣
This movies have always been dumb comedy n unbearable to watch in cinema i would never watch this bullshit in cinema again after vin drove a car in helicopter but lived   Fuuuuuuuckkkk arrrrrf  Never again ill watch this at home loool
Lost it when they put the space car in gear
7:38 This movie will entertaining a lot of people? Are you been drinking a lot before doing this review👀
Brian ( Dom's kid ) was with O'Conner . They mentioned in the movie , Letty says it..
Remember like roman said they are invincible
It was the setup to the new Super Fast & furious saga, the last race would be in the rainbow road and digital paul walker will be there.
I mean what else could you expect after how far Hobbs and Shaw went with flying human beings doing cartoon shit lol
they leave Little Brian with big Brian that's where he was and that's how they explained that Brian wasn't in the movie as well when Mia showed up he was taking care of both kids
They left Brian with Brian. Letty tells Dom just before they embark to assuage his guilt and fear.
This is why I stop watching Fast and the furious movies since part 4 & Tokyo Drift because the saga just doesn't make any sense no more.
At this point I wouldn't be surprised if Dom transforms with his charger to fight Megatron
This movie make transformer look more real
Zero reply value
The baby was with Dom’s brother in Law, Big Brian. There was a line in the movie about it. I’ve seen it twice, so some plot holes actually got filled for me when I watched it looking for the answers.
Come on, F9 is more sci-fi than Babylon 5
Don't press "F10". It'll open a new window trying to sell you stuff you don't want.
They said in the movie that lil Brian was with big Brian and the cuzzes.
Forsure the worst one.
so you mean to tell me that a toyota supra with an electromagnet in the trunk CAN'T actually flip a giant military type transport truck that out weighs it by 100,000 lbs ? 😳 I love watching these movies but this one was just straight up clownshoes. they have definitely lost it in a big way.
Must be hard to be a movie critic, in a decade where 95% of movies sucks. I feel for you Chris
Come on, Chris.  All these films are well-made Hilariocity’s lol
I joked with my wife after the last one t hat what are they going to do next go to space or attache rockets to a car lol well they did attache rockets to a car so oh well I guess I can see the future now next fast and  furious races in space Destroy the Death star car
As far as Dom’s kid goes, they hinted at Paul Walker’s character babysitting him & Mia’s kid during the movie. Also I think the dude Cena was fighting who didn’t react to the street sign hitting him was wearing whatever suit Idris Elba was during Hobbs & Shaw… The movie was definitely ass-water though
me and the boys had a few drinks and then went and saw this movie and can confirm -- great fun will be had when you know it is an absurdist comedy. it is definitely two-o's stoopid but thats kind of what makes it fun. it is not a good movie, but for sure is not a boring one either!
Doms son Brian is with his uncle “Brian” in the movie
Brian was with uncle Brian
Paul walker is turning in his grave and saying... please do not bring me back to life F10... if they do, well they better make this movie more relatable and make it out about street racing...bunch of dumb ass writers and director.
For all we know, they might joined the avengers,revengers. Knock offs of the avengers or just joined the JL In the multiverse.. magnets and outer space!! Come on now..what an effen circus of a movie.
It's only a quick line but they say that Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is looking after little Brian.
It’s like AI wrote this movie
I also keep on thinking about the keyboard key 😂
Chris where'd you get that epic JP shirt???
and IGN gave this an 8, becoz family. but on the other hand gave Black Widow a 7 and said "Black Widow also repeats some of Marvel’s tiresome trends with women superheroes and their heavy-handed, cheesy empowerment messages" HOW ABOUT THE DAMN FF FRANCHISE??? ISNT IT TIRESOME??? LOL
I hate these movies I blame them for a bunch of idiots taking the mufflers off their cars to make them sound"cool"
As a fast and furious fan its  a above averge movie 💯
I feel like saying actors had fun is over rated, but this might be the main reason to watch this series. Sure, the movie series is not very good and particularly this one seemed incredibly corny, but my God, they really seemed to mean it.
I gave up on Fast and the Furious a long time ago after F6 and Hobs and Shaw lol.
a c-?  worst movie ever
Dom or Letty called Mia or Brian to take care of Brian. I guess
Space the final frontier these are the Voyages of  Tej&Roman 😂 did Justin Lin think he was directed  another Star Trek movie 🤣
SPOILER ALERT. Through out the whole fast movies the cars they race were actually transformers part 10. So the cars will transform this time and the world will ask vin to team up with the transformer to defeat the dinosaur s from jurassic world.   I hope im fuck. In wrong i said they go to space 7 years.
Universal should go balls deep insane. Have Dom partake in a secret mission. Transporting a mysterious cargo. Everyone is chasing them for this cargo. Dom decides to see what the cargo is. It was a time machine! For some reason they get transported to the Jurassic Era. Now they ride dinosaurs and shit. That's all I got so far.
Will the next movie be set in space? and is Hobbs  on the moon? after the Vin and Rock fallout.
With space done can we have underwater cars next? 😂🤣
I can't believe u were able to see JACOB(JOHN CENA)😭😭😭
The kid was with Bryan...
This film is a cartoon lol. The unrealism is hilarious
In Vin Diesel’s defense Ram Man from the He-Man cartoon was also 5’6” tall and had a super humanly hard head
I hope someone points out that Sean is supposed to be around 22-25 years old in this movie but looks like he's almost 40
They did mention where little Brian was, he’s with Paul Walker’s Brian character. I respect everyone’s opinions on a film but this just shows that this dude didn’t really pay attention. Makes him lose credibility at least in my eyes.
Fast 10 is when dom realizes he is riddick.
Next Fast will have to fight aliens on their planet when one of the family was kidnapped. Think colonial Marines.
Did you even watch the movie? Brian ( Paul Walkers Character ) was babysitting the kids. It was mentioned in the movie.
U said exactly how I felt in the theater.. just now........
Just saw this movie....WOW....
Fast 10 time travel
Fast 10: Power 9000
Glad this wasn’t their one last ride
Going to space was the best part of this movie the rest was bleh
The cooperative poison neuroanatomically melt because game generically try pace a female fertile experience. adorable, petite sidecar
That kid is Toreto's son. He neeeds nobody to take care of him
Lil Brian was being babysat by the deceased Brian.
The word you are looking for is - Stupid...
Your wrong stuckman 1 and 5 are the best
This is like the third review I’ve heard Chris use to “turn off your brain” argument or a variation of it ... when does it become we’re just watching stupid shit? 🤣😅😂
And I thought when Jason vorhees killed people in space were bad 😂
That Jurassic Park t shirt looks like it has a transformer head in the back ground! Soundwave?
dude I love your shirt where can this man buy one ?
Spoilers        Seriously you dont want to ear this if u haven't seen the movie            How the f did toretto fought against 40+ dudes, pushed all of them for like 5 seconds and beat half of them and them knocked/killed the rest by collapsing a structure   Response: Family
*Two movies ago F7 features cars jumping from skyscraper to skyscraper across the Abu Dhabi skyline* "I think they jumped the shark on this one." on THIS one?!
Holy S#%T! I just figured it out: Mr. Nobody is the main Thanos level “big-bad”! He was the mysterious voice during ‘Hobbs & Shaw’; who has a better chance of obtaining all of these WMDs than the man who is arresting or protecting those that have or created them. Let these various criminals steal all of the various tech, arrest them and keep it all for himself. Brilliant
Over all the movie was great I think. Better than f8
Cars are like pillows man. Land on a car and you’re fine. Not a scratch.
Fist time ever .... I have to disagree with you
People who watch fast n furious have no brain
They mentioned Brian was watching Brian.
What did u think of Jacob Dom’s relationship they needed more of prequal
I wouldn’t waste a fucking dollar on this movie
When I first tried to watch the first movie of this saga after the first 10 minutes I knew what was all this stupid movie was going to be all about, never seen none of the rest! Hate the concept !
Can you review all fast & furious please ?
F&F is like the Friday the 13th of action movies. They get crazier and crazier. Sh!t didn't Jason go to space too?! 🤣
Fast should’ve ended in the 7th one
As a petrolhead, I kinda miss the first movie. It wasn't anything, really, but it kinda opened a window into the tuner community and was just more grounded. It all started with VHS player theft, and now they're into space....Honestly, with all the absurdity of the safe heist, which incredibly they actually did with practical effects, it still was a hundred times more grounded, and I could suspend my disbelief. From F6 on they started saving the world all of a sudden, it just was WAAAAAAAAAAAAY to jarring. But then again, maybe I'm wrong in wanting things to make sense in the Fast movies, because FAMILY.
You should review Bo Burnham’s Netflix Special “Inside”! It’s basically a one-man-film, I think you’d find it interesting
I have never seen any of the fast and furious movies and I have to admit, I kinda feel like anyone who would watch these may be kinda 🦥 slow, this looks so dumb who would sit through this garbage, flying tanks and cars get a life
When People forget it’s just a movie 🤡
Brian was home watching over the kids
FasTEN Your Seatbelts!
Plot this, Toreto did not survive the crash in the first movie, he is actually in coma, and all the movies from then on, are part of his imagination...that is why ist getting more and more extreme...as her sister unplug the life support..
3:45 yes yes yes YES that's exactly what it feels like. it is imitating fast and furious and that's why it didn't feel like it was amazing because I did enjoy myself the entire way but it didn't feel like all the others felt
2:41 you must not of been listening 😂 Brian was taking care of Lil Brian
In the next film, Dom's father is actually not dead and it was all a big setup by a super secret spy organization operating on the dark side of the Moon. Oh and he is portrayed by Hulk Hogan.
Oh yeah… you missed this review. Shockingly, you’re totally wrong
Ngl i really want to see the jurrasic world crossover
I agree for the most but the doms kid brian mia says that paul or brian was watching him and his kids later in the movie
After all of the fantastic Fast and Furious, how can they manage to mess this up? They already had a formula, but they managed to butcher this movie. SO SAD. because I love these guys. OH BY THE WAY< i dont know if you didnt catch it but when the sister came on, she said HER KIDS and Doms Kids were "safe" they were with BRIAN (which means they wrote BRIAN back into the script...) and did you notice that at the end his car pulled up for the picnic? Yep. all a bunch of hooey
They mentioned brian was with brian lol
The first three are the real movies the rest are just exploitation movies
Omg it’s a movie. Why everyone talking bout defines logics and physics? That’s what movie does it’s not suppose to be taken literal 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
Brian was babysitting the kids . That’s how they kept him in the film.
Biggest fan of Fast and Furious. But Fast 9 was horseshit. Was waiting a long time for it to come out, only to realize it was going to be a cartoon meme action film, smh.
Does it not bother anyone else that the kid is named Brian also?  Isnt that weird to have two characters in the film with the same name? Why not name Doms kid Paul, to give it more depth!
Let's be  rea,l franchise died when Walker died, they should've stopped right there
Hard agree. Worst in the franchise
BRIAN WAS BABYSITTING LITTLE BRIAN BECAUSE IN THE MOVIE BRIAN SR IS NOT DEAD. DOMS SISTER REJOINS TEAM WHILE BRIAN WATCHES THE KIDS. THEY DO MENTION IT.
Yawn. Boring franchise boring characters
F10 in Space
This guy face in the thumbnail say it all 😐
Sooner or later Hollywood's gonna become Bollywood. And Bollywood is trash. And most people on earth don't know Bollywood.
At this point these guys are stronger than the Avengers and the movie is not about cars anymore IMO
Just in case mía and leti told dom that there Kids(including little brian) were with Brian protecting them   They keep using the carácter
This is the kind of fast and Furious movie you can enjoy if you knew how to turn your 🧠 off for 2 hours
2:40...I think at one point Mia (or Letty, not sure) said Dom's son was with Brian. They also discussed how Brian was babysitting his own son...
I think this franchise is a test to see how far they can push a series's premise until it looks nothing like the original, Until they start talking about magic. That's how you know they played us
We are testing how far we can go, i mean golf cart is getting faster, rockets can land and we are goin to mars.  Sorry about the spoiler...ff10 will be in mars😇
This was Sharknado with cars
This series is so close to my heart that I refuse to watch this one... I know it's gonna ruin the last 15 years of my life
F10: The family sits down for dinner and is abruptly interrupted. They begin driving cars on water in pursuit of Cypher and Brian’s hybrid drone clone after finding Jesus’s hidden power in the crosses the Torretos wear.
Spinoff Tej and Rome in space   Plot twist it's a prequel to homeboys in space
F10 or FX introduces time travel or multiverse or just more space shit idk I'm sure they all get drunk and high and write these movies
Doms from California that brick wall wasnt tough enough for his head
I live my life a quarter million dollars worth of damage at a time
"China 9".... "China 10"...... When will the Chinese connection end ???
I refuse to watch "China 9".... I mean Beijing Cena.... A man who apologized to the dictatorship China for calling Taiwan a country... When every one who has half a brain knows for a fact that Taiwan is, and always has been a country
Huh what was that?? Lololol
Oh my lord...Simpsons predicts again! Look up the fight between Bart and Skinner where they attach each other with their allergies Shrimp / Peanuts and during this fight the Star Wars music is playing and a part happens where they are on top of a bus as they approach a bridge now you expect them to either duck or jump or move out of the way some how but instead they continue fighting and casually break through this concrete bridge with no reaction
Brian was babysitting Brian
4:37 this is the part when I walked out. Crap. Fucking street sign should’ve decapitated dude or knocked him off the truck or some other very serious injury. Nope it’s paper mache.
Cardi b was in this movie…..
Funko put out a Fast & Furious: Highway Heist board game. In the game, the player characters jump to the nearest car, no matter how far away it is, whenever their car is destroyed or they fall off the tank/truck. That's been a rule in the movies for quite a few movies.
As someone who is a big fan of this franchise, to be honest I loved the movie and had a great time! Of course it’s so much more over the top and cheesy and I agree that it doesn’t quite feel like a F&F movie but I wasn’t at all disappointed. A couple things took me out of the movie and one of them is just the close up face shots, there’s literally like 8 or 9 shots of those. I was also excited about the ending and hopefully seeing Brian return in 10. I really hope Caleb and Cody Walker return cause you honestly can’t end this franchise without Brian. You really cannot!
Brian is watching Brian
Dom being collecting dragon balls wishing he's friends back also " next time on dragon fast z" Two space racer are heading towards earth and z racers got to prepare for this threat 🤣🤣
I find it dumb that the never showed Dom's brother seeing as he was brought up in the movie a lot, also I think dom is schizophrenic or something as he was talking to himself for like half the movie. Over all the movie is kinda trash though
I think I forced myself to laugh a couple of times but ughh this movie felt like bloat and when tyrese killed a whole platoon of FUCKING SOLIDERS I was like yeah I mean what are stakes
they said the kid was with adult bryan
F10 may be the finale, but we all know it died in F9.. Went to far. Space.. Really?  They need to go back to there roots with street races.
They actually said that Bryan was taking care of all the kids
Never seen these movies
Fast and Furious 11 and 12: "Hey, can we copy your homework?"  Avengers 3 and 4: "Sure, just make it look different so that it doesn't look like you just copied it."
F I give it an f
Garbage
Never will have respect for Vin again
🗑️
I walked out. Lat movie I walked out of was a nightmare on elm street
I’m sure this is going to be greeted with much hate, but, this movie is so stupid. In my entire life I’ve walked out of 3 movies:  1. Wild, Wild, West 2. Mama Mia 3. F9 Couldn’t take it anymore when unexplained chains happen to be hanging around and Dom manages to pull the structure down. The ONLY thing good up to this point was Charlize Theron, albeit in a plexiglass box, but have no idea why she signed onto this garbage!
Also they say that brian was babysitting
Watched this film and it was boring and very unrealistic and john cena ain't a serious actor imo
Brian was being babysat by Brian. Use your head pasty chris
I thought Mia said that Brian was babysitting Brian.
The mad libs finally did it took them to space and I was like DO WHAT
What a dumpsterfire, but im glad you seem to enjoy it
Physics has left the chat
LOVED it! Lmao. So over the top, magnets, going to space and FUN! You gotta be a real maniac to expect Oscar winning stuff from this. lol
The fast and furious crew could be the avengers at this point.
Just the thumbnail had me cracking up
In the next movie: Torreto brothers and sister And Shaw brothers and sisters  They will go to the moon where cypher will try to weaponize the moon and the Rock will use the peoples elbow on the moon in space suit Eventually, Dom's father who will be alive, will fly a rocket and crash again to save earth.
I laughed from start to finish it was exactly what I wanted
He forgot one thing hobbs is still alive
fas10 your seatbelts
I walked out halfway through..
FX on the way ....😄
Just seen film so good and they do say who is looking after Brian it’s Paul walkers Brian who is at home baby sitting his two kids and Dom’s son Brian
But they do need to go underwater next.  The cars are going to be turned into aquamechanical submarines that use nos for... air.  So with the infusion of the air from the nos to create air bubbles they breathe that while the cars are outfitted with... tougher metal and the wheels are given extra ridges... BOOM... water car.  Plus... they have family.  You can't beat that.  f10... this time its wet.
I can sum it up in 2 words.  It sucked.
They mentioned paul walker was watching the kid
JOHN CHINA
Physics doesn't need family. It has fast and furious.
How bout the part when Dom fights off like 20 dudes then uses his Superman strength to pull down stone columns.
It was good but not great
Fast 10, Dom and the family take the space cars out to Mars to hijack a shipment of Martian DVD players. Dom finds out that the DVD players actually are responsible for the death of his father so he challenges them to a drag race...on the streets.
Remember that’s not letty’s son that’s dom’s son with Elena also little Brian was off screen with Brian babysitting aka Paul Walker
Mannn I love fast and furious but honestly this new movie wasn’t bad it wasn’t good either. I am just mad  that they have a drift king and didn’t use him. . This movie moved too damn fast . They went up in space , wtf.  They got all this talent and are not using it
I hate what this franchise is. I enjoyed the first movie because it felt like it was at least trying to be a movie about car culture. It's just an action movie with cars since.
F10 will be on Mars
Whoa, whoa whoa, is Helen Mirren in this?  Okay, I've got to give it a shot.
I thought the movie was great
The fast franchise died when Paul Walker died that’s just my opinion it hasn’t been good since
Fast and Furious is taking the Leprachaun path. not much long that we get Fast 11 in the hood and Fast 12 back to the hood after they leave space.
The way they explained Han not being  dead just negates the whole ending and motive of the lead guy to race the yakuza leader’s son in Tokyo drift   It doesn’t make any sense  and the fact that ppl will watch this and think oh that’s cool. NO. That’s not how you write plot
Only seen up to 5 but the reviews are pretty funny
Please review the purge movie
F9 .....skys the limit!!!!, No....we're going to space!!
I feel the same.
After Paul died. I stopped watching
F10 will have optimus prime i guess
This franchise needed to die a long time ago.. people keep coming back to watch them and money talks..🤷🏻‍♂️
I face palmed myself a couple times throughout this movie.  Especially when Dom/Vin Diesel destroyed the entire platform by pulling down on two chains.   I hoped we would have seen better racing scenes, the racing scene between young dom and his brother was not impressive.   And how that big truck just flipped over.. c'mon this is ridiculous LOL!
They said where little Brian was …they say he’s in the safest place he can be implying his uncle Brian
You gave a C- to this wildly forgettable movie? You are being about as generous as the idiots who actually contributed to the earnings this film made at the box office. I watched this online and thank goodness because I would be feeling as though I was just robbed if I paid to see this in theatre.
For me it ended when Dom and Brian went their separate ways
FX is leaning towards space 😂 and fast 11 it’s gonna have a crossover with Jurassic park. Could it get any more ridiculous?
Babysitting Brian was Brian vin diesel said we have the best babysitter Brian he was watching the kids
I miss reviews like this 😂😂 just making fun of the movie makes me smile 😊
🤣🤣🤣
No cap i saw it last night it wasn’t that good Ngl
I watched a cam leak, and I'm with you. Even though the Roman/Tej meta commentary about them being invincible was funny, everything just felt tacked together and just seemed too over the top.
That's exactly the mindset I have each time I see a FF movie
They did explain Little Brian by the way. He was with Paul Walker's off-screen character. In universe, big Brian is still alive.
tokyo drift was the movie that gravitated the most around custom street racing cars and it made it so nice in spite of it having a totally new cast
Disappointed
I Turned off my brain and went with zero expectations just to have a good time.
Where did you get that Jurassic tee? I need it
now im not trying to defend the movie as its trash but, they dropped bryan off with brayn.
I found myself looking at my watch thinking, crap this has an hour left!  I threw in the towel when a Pontiac Fierro went into space and with perfect precision rammed a satellite.  I know Justin Lin had much to clean up and bring the storylines back to when he directed but I felt like this movie was all over the place with story arcs.
It became a Saints Row movie.  Don for president before the aliens come.
Money I will never get back. Arguably the worst Fast & Furious to date.
The most hilarious thing I’ve heard is that Charlize Theron is Simple Rick!!! 😂😂
THIS MOVIE WAS A JOKE LOL!!
What's more stupid: Dom jumped onto and running on a sideway going rocket in the game; or he Tarzan swing a broken bridge with a car?
I'm only seeing this film for the JW Dominion Teaser...
Happy Pride, Chris! ❤️
I had to turn it off on the beginning scene where the guy had all the people with guns around him and only his bulletproof vest got hit
Veteran of the fast and furious franchise, what a shameful title.
Ya no..wont be supporting any actors who pledge  their allegiance to the ccp "cena"...or to traitors like biden "the rock"
Worst movie in years. This franchise is absolutely horrible. Defending even one of these movies after the first makes me seriously question someones competency.
Let me guess.. Fast 10 is gonna finally feature Dom's mom. "Family" comes full circle. And its gonna be realized that their all cyborgs.🤣🤣
Little Brian was with Big Brian (RIP Paul Walker)
You said it best. Fast 9 is a long 2 hours of comedy..🤣🤣🤣🤣.
I want to see how the explanation channels on YouTube try and explain and make sense of this movie without overlooking logic
Biggest film flop this year... and not waste time on a film like this! Crap film!! Reminde me of Bollywood movies!
I haven't seen any of the other films in their entirety but I saw this for the air conditioning during the PNW heatwave. It felt like watching an out of context episode of a soap opera I've never seen before that's been running for decades and I kinda wanna check out the others lmao
Now that they've done space, next is time travel...
Lol.. great review..
I like how stupid these movies are becoming. Felt a bit boring for a while. I like the direction hobbs and shaw took. Hope they keep going down that road and just make insanely absurd action/comedies with cars.
0:40 That might be the best laugh i've heard in a while 😂
FX : Carnado
In this movie they were one step from looking at the camera and talking to the audience. I agree, Roman theorizing stuff took me out of the experience a bit :/
This the closest Hollywood imitation of Bollywood
A lot of the absurd parts would be alright if it was the Rock that did it since most of the most crazy none car super human stuff was done by him and its kina part of his character.    Like your door frame part.  If it was the Rock that would be normal.
Let me guess it's the same as all the other ones, cars, guns, bad writing, and dialogue with shitty acting from Vin diesel. Yea I'm sick of these movies.
This movie was surprisingly tame for a fast and furious movie
Brian was watching Brian lol
Garbage! Especially j0hn chyna.
I stopped watching when Brian/Paul died (R.I.P.) because to me, there’s no point to the series without the Brian & Dom relationship
I remember the Fast 6 Diesel jump catch. Everyone in the theater was clapping. I was like “So this is how the saga dies, with thunderous applause”.
If the avengers had Dom they wouldn’t need 2 movies to take down thanos... A car in space 😂😂😂haaa
0:42
I thought something was said in the movie about toreto’s son supposedly being with Brian.... like his uncle Brian but now I don’t know lol
FAMILY
I only use 10 brain cells... *a quarter mile at a time.*
Just for this review you get a sub you got me laughing in my car at 5:20 am
Fast 12: Godzilla vs Dom!  Make it happen!
Ok so is it just me or is it possible that F9 is set in the same universe of Days Of Thunder???…… hear me out  So we have the flashbacks to Dom’s dad in NASCAR, chief mechanic is a guy called Buddy, played by Micheal Rucker, who played NASCAR driver Rowdy Burns in DoT, his chief mechanic was a guy called Buck Brotherton, so we find Michael Rucker back in NASCAR is it possible that the mechanic is none other than BUDDY BROTHERTON?? Who dies in a fiery crash at Daytona? I know it’s a long shot but I think it was a bit of an Easter egg???
This movie is a joke 👎😂 in space  Next fast and the furious vs power rangers 💯🤣🤣
The villain for Fast 10 must be a lovechild of Brian and Dom. The ultimate enemy. Perfect genes. All their strenght, no weakness.
Garbage....  Paul would go again
Why do people watch this shit!
I haven’t seen it yet but I feel like the film could’ve been saved if Diesel and Rock could get along for just a couple scenes.  Edit: imagine Rock vs Cena and don’t bring up their wrestling match lol
It's like this went from Jaws to Sharknado.
Outrunning a submarine was still realistic enough, but this was not? I don't get it. I had a blast with this movie, but I guess that's cuz I know this is the logical conclusion of where Fast and Furious should go
I feel like this one will set up hobbs vs dom again to play off vin vs the rock again
Fast & furious is all about car chase and some story twist. This movie is about stupidity
They spent so much time wondering if they could that they didn’t think to wonder if they should
Big Brian was looking after little Brian
That's the problem with making stupid movies for the sake of stupidity. You're making a bet on the audience's ability to forgive the stupidity, hence the rest of the movie's flaws. Worse still are the legions of stupid people going CHILL BRO ITS MEANT TO BE DUMB JUST SWITCH OFF YOUR BRAIN, trying to derail other people's objectivity.  With 9 movies this series could have expanded in every single direction of storytelling and action but it all boils down to stupid action because that is what the majority of movie goers want. The series is artistically bankrupt while rolling in the financial dough.
There should be a movie for every F# (key stroke) button on the keyboard
Brian is babysitting Brian. Also, Brians kids are with him as well. Its mentioned by Jordana Brewster when she makes her appearance.
This is why Tyrese Gibson's character is so awesome, mentioning that they are invincible. It seemed like a nod to the fact that they know they are ridiculous
I went to hitman’s wife’s bodyguard and I think it was a better action comedy to behonest.
As a comedy it's an A lol
F10 visiting moon by a car  F11 visiting march by a car F12 visiting the Solar system by a car F13 Visiting the f**king Galaxy by a car🔥
F9 was kinda disappointing...  Specially space scene I mean like seriously 🤣
when Van Diesel jumps out the truck un scratch smh
"I'm not running!!!!"
Blood makes you related, loyalty makes you family. Trust me, it is overrated and I never jumped on that bandwagon. Just like these movies.   Signed: Little Orphan J
2:30 they did explain it. Brian O’Connor was .
I think it needs more family, where's Dom's mom and other secret sister besides Mia?
🚮🚮🚮 couldn't be any worse🙂
brian took care of brian aka paul but dead guy
The first one was by far the best it had heart, soul, tragedy, honor With good character development!! And Brian had to ultimately choose what kinda moral integrity he stood for!! decent dialogue and decent acting! thank god because that Most that shit unfortunately went out the window with later Releases!!
Yes! I felt like the heart wasn’t in this movie. The pathos was missing.
Wasted talent in most of these goofy shits. I hate bad physics in movies.
Still haven't seen a Fast & Furious movie. Then again, I haven't seen a James Bond movie either.
Even films based on a true story can be wacky and far from reality. I really haven't thought of fast and furious as being real. I mean did we forget fast 5 jail break scene?. Still this film is fun! That's why the series is still making big money.
This movie doesn't do anything better than the others in the series.  It doesn't have a standout moment or set piece.  Not to mention all the character connections that didn't need to be made that serve no purpose but to complicate the timeline even more.  Definitely my least favorite of the series
I can't wait for The Jurassic Furious.
A real F up.
Should have gave it a F...for family of course
I like the F9 key picture. GOT DAMM IT STUCKMAN!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's not letty's son. It's the lady from Rio. From fast five. Also Brian O'Connor was watching doms son while the were on the mission. Of course the real Brian is dead. So they said Brian's character was watching the kid.
“ Nothing beats the power of family “.
It was so over the top - but still fun.
They didn't jump the shark, they rammed the satellite.
Ridiculous, absurd, cartoonish, and all other similar adjectives are not necessarily indicators of BAD movies... unless they're used to describe a new movie in a series that, until now, has been (somewhat) serious and dramatic. This movie, while pretty to look at and sounded great,  was just bad: silly plot, bland script, and bad acting by everyone involved except for Helen Mirren's too few minutes onscreen as Magdeline Shaw. Also, I'm guessing Vin didn't get paid enough to work the muscles in his arms AND lose the beer gut this time around - very noticeable.  But, if all you're looking for is something loud and full of dazzling explosions, this movie will satisfy your craving.
i think your lost in life
They did explain where there kid was he was with Bryan that’s why they teased him at the end
The best great reveal for this absurdity is that all is a Videogame
The next movie will be called FasTen Your Belts
Um actually, Brian isn't Letty's son
The ROCK helped this fast and furious and VIN CRY BABY  took him out because  the ROCK would have kicked his ass
Seems like There always....a thing that someone else has that they need to get..... of which there is only one...... no one ever thought to make more than one of...  just in case you might need another one....that ultimately needs a thing that's on the other side of the world that works the thing-ummy-bob.....Which they must get whatever it takes because  who ever has  the thing-ummy-bob would have ultimate power and could take over the WORLD. 😴 is that 😴😴😴 about it
If you have flashbacks about past times in your life it can bring you back from the dead & give you super human strength 👍🏻 I never knew that.
Will not see it because of John China Cena.  Taiwan is a country.
The new jump the shark is "Nuke the fridge" from Indiana Jones 4
They actually did pull safes in fast five watch the making lol
Brian was babysitting Brian.
F9: fuk physics.
I was a fan of this franchise until THIS film. Tbh I think Fast 5 should have been the end of it!
Dom’s “Hulk Smash” moment a few movies ago was when the series jumped the shark like… too much.
I stopped at 5... maybe I'll catch up on them some day; when they've colonized another planet comprised entirely of race tracks straight out of mario kart.
God, I hate these movies so much
First Jason X and now F9, I think “going to space” has replaced “jumping the shark” for me.
They should’ve stopped at Fast 7
Who's in the blue car THE ROCK BRIAN ??
I give 7,8 and 9 all A+’s
I saw this today, having seen none of the other ones. As Louis Theroux said when he'd finished WCW training camp: I don't know what I've just experienced, but I'm glad that it's over.
8 and 9 doesn't exsist
They did explain where Brain was. Remember when Mia came into frame? Chessy stuff but great movie i think. Had me entertained.
Brian was taking care of the family farm, c'mon man... FAMILY!
Bollywood copies Hollywood but way ridiculous F9 copies Bollywood
Next movie the FF Family will join Iron Man to save the world! lol
Mia & Letty told Dom that baby Brian is with adult Brian....😑
I think this is the most memorable one in the series. It's absolutely ridiculous..like epic...like hilariosity...like cult classic rocky horror
Thank you for this. Preparing my mindset to make this a comedy was all that saved me from feeling this was an awful flick.
That's exactly what it felt like from the first few minutes: like I was watching a cartoon.
If they're super heroes where is paul walker? they might not have thought that through
Watched today and ogres with u they crossed the line and it was just laughable always they do..and the bad guys with guns must be faring blanks or they blind as couldn't hit anything lol
I just saw this in theaters last night, fully prepared for it to be ass, and I was not wrong. There were a few good (or at least not awful, senseless) scenes that I was like, ight, that's not terrible, but the rest. Oh God. There are so many things I rolled my eyes at, but SPACE. They went to SPACE in a fuckin car. Bruh, when i tell you, I was GONE.
Oh man I laughed when i heard Chris laugh! Lol
🎥 It’s Funny, Vin didn’t have 1 scratch on his face, if he had one, It would have disappeared in the next clip. 🍿
Breaking the 4th wall, minus the smooth Deadpool 🤣
They explained that lil Brian was in good hands with Brain O'Connor. You must of missed that part
Did anybody get a blade runner vibe from some of the scenes? Like kind of cyberpunk and then they eat at the noodle bar just like blade runner.
you are right. Also the way people just switch sides in these movies is kinda rediculous. that is one of the things I don't like about these. these people have a moral compass that just swings like a pendulum. But I've seen all of them so I'll go see the last one too (number 10 will be the last one, the contract they signed was for 10 movies. not even Paul dying got them out of it. One thing I do love about these movies that were made after Pauls death is how they manage to include him in the movies without actually showing him, the ending scene, where he drives into the driveway in his Skyline was perfect.
After I saw that dumpster fire that was Fast and the Furious Crossroads, and Dom running and jumping over A GODDAMN ROCKET, I knew shit was getting insane. That was probably the only "good part" of that game.       I didn't buy it, I saw Angry Joe's review and Yongyea's videos on it.
Fast and furious hasn’t been good since 4. Also at this point stop the Paul walker baiting shits disrespectful man let him Rest In Peace.
The average party tellingly connect because bay preferentially phone plus a bright sun. craven, colossal copyright
F10 they will be racing in an interdimensional part of space chasing an alien because the alien kidnapped Dom's son
Here’s my order:   1. F5 2. F3 (Tokyo Drift) 3. F1 4. F2 5. F6 6. F7 (Paul Walker’s last movie) 7. F4 8. F8 9. F9
The space part actually happened? Bruh
Can't wait for Fast X: racing underwater
Cars 10/10. Action 7/10.  Realism minus 10/10. Apart from the stupidity on realism that dom pulls off every time a action scene that involves him is a absolute disgrace. He never has a scratch on him no matter what happens to him. Great cars . Great gadgets.  Rubbish dom . I think they sell fake wounds and fake blood at the joke shop for a pound each. Think about it next time with the next fast and furious!!. God forbid there will be a next.
f9 for f serious f expressions.
Think of F9 as a live action comic book movie and i think you'll be fine!
I didn't like the movies after fast 5 because it was really just really really silly. But I really liked 9 just cause they double downed on the crazy shit. For me I rather them go 100% into the crazy crazy stuff then be in the middle trying to hide it. I thought it was hilarious and some of the best action.
F9: Space Vin Diesel: Family
Justice for HAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We NEED JUSTICE FOR HAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Justice for HAN!!!!!!! JUSTICE!!!!!!!!!!!
Fast & Furious going to space is that moment in the franchise when Fonzie has jumped the shark
Oh man, Chris you haven't showed up in my feed since the religious video. You should probably check on that.
Stupid action is good but the Fast and Furious series overdone it, it is tiresome at this point, I hope they will go make the series more grounded in the upcoming movies. I would just love a good racing story like Ford vs Ferrari no bullshit just a storyline built around a racer.
You’re wrong the movie is pure shit
U wasn't paying attention 2 the movie it clear tells us who had the baby.
I stopped when Letty came back from the dead.
I think they took the Action too far... I still might watch it. Just watch cool cars, epic action, and a ok story.
Jumping the Fiero.  You pretty much summed up the feeling I felt watching the movie.  POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW!!   I joked with a friend though that the most unbelievable thing in this movie is John Cena fitting in a new Supra.
Noone cares about Haun
It's turned into marvel all the people acting and all feels fake and is totally stupid. Yeah family OK that's not gonna sell stupid movies vin, don't sucker people n with that bs it's do far from what part one was that is sick
Yeah it sucks, everything after Paul walker is a joke and embarrassment to car prople and yes 5 was the best
Saw it yesterday, freaking hilarious
They should've stopped after the 2nd one Fast 15: Not So Fast In Space
Bro, I expected an action movie, but what I got was a fucking comedy. Hands down the most absurd movie I've ever seen.
Didn’t James Bond at one point end up in space?  😂
This guy face Thumbnail is truly terrifying he looks like a maniac.
So this wasn't as good as army of the dead? It must be the worst movie of the year
That bad it made ne think maybe they should have ended it after the first one never mind the 5th one.
The dead guy was babysitting the kids. Then he pulled up at the bbq as a ghost driving a Skyline.
It was dope when y’all was racing in the streets and in the trenches in rio and Tokyo, and how y’all made the story’s twist from future movies, now this franchise on some bs transformer bs🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I have no idea what these movies are about anymore. First they street raced, then they ran from the goverment, then they worked for the government,  then they went to space. Also a spin off where the rock fights a black cyborg.  I checked out a few movies ago but I really have no idea what's going on anymore and I'm not sure they do either.
Brian was babysitting Brian and the other kids. They even said if. How’d you miss that?
Felt just the same way and i also have all the movies on Blue Ray.
Man I’m not watching that shit
Only thing left is time travel
Jesus christ is coming repent choose him today,he loves you.
Me: From ¼ to space, why Dom: family
They are running out of ideas lol
I need to know where you got that t shirt Chris
To answer your question about little Brian. It is stated in the movie that "Brian" is taking care of him. As to your review, spot on 👍
F10- Im Not going to be surprise that his dad didn’t die 😂😂 he jumped into the crowd and left.  Here comes another fat flash back. Dom gets mad at Jacob for not telling him that he knew his dad didn’t die 😂 and here we go again
this franchise is actually Big Budget Sharknado but way less enjoyable
I was shown an extended trailer for the upcoming Jurassic World right before the movie started and I was seriously wondering if that was the beginning of F9. That's the current state of this movie franchise.
It was said that Brian was watching Brian
They jumped the shark
@8:20 They explained that Brian, Sr. (Paul Walker) was watching Little Brian
In fast 10 they gonna time travel, I'm sure of it  Let's not talk about fast 11 where they get the infinity stones
Can’t wait to see Fast 12 when it’s revealed that Dom’s father faked his death
I think due to Dwayne and Vin not liking one another legit, might have made their fights have more oomph due to them probably getting a shot in from time to time,
I think this movie will turn into a cult classic.  3-5 years from now, people will be playing it on late movie nights with alcohol and just watching a car in *VIRGIN GALACTIC* while drunk will become a must
buckle up buckaroo.
So was John Cena actually Vin Diesel's brother? Or was this more "mUh FaMiLy" bullshit?
The NWA song (appetite for destruction) used in the flashback 🔥
They did really good with the scoring
Fast 10 the final movie....reveals they are all androids and clones. Aliens. As well as they race dinosaurs. Dun dun ddduuuuummmmmm
just saw this, its was numbingly boring. so much action with characters who dont ever get hurt that it was boring. my buddie fell asleep. i thought these movies were supposed to be about cars and car culture....guess not anymore.
“How in the hell are you not dead?” Lol
Not u bro they lost everyone!
F-U
I thought the movie was great and really fun. The action scenes and comedy were great, but Han’s story was kind of a letdown.
They said paul waller was taking care of Brian Chris
I disagree. Fast5 is not the best one. The first one is the best one. It actually had a story and the story made sense. Well it make sense compared to every FF movies.
This movie looks like shit and a superhero movie
I died 🤣 when Chris said the next one has to be called FX IF ITS NOT CALL FX IDK WTF THEIR DOING 😂
In the next F&F film, they're gonna go to Asgard and steal an infinity stone 😂😂😂
That's alena kid
GameSpot gave this garbage a 9. Can you believe that crap?
I always thought the green plot device is really cartoonish when Jakob puts it in that wall
The F series is amazing. Until brian died in real life.. That F5 is the culmination to be honest. After F5 I just watch them for the F series to support the movie just like this F9.. I just watch them.. no critics! no what so ever!
Just came home from watching it. My god it’s ridiculous
This was such a hilarious movie. I loved it.
"this is 100% a CARtoon" Chris 2021
Super dumb, that part of Tyrese. Showing the bullets and mentioning all the past adventures only made thinking of the Why. Why they do that, what was the purpose. It supposed to be funny
THEY WENT TO SPACE
I do not support Cena and I never will
Fast 1: has logic  Fast 9: we don't need logic, we have family
I’m pretty sure Mia explains that Brian is watching the children while they are on the mission. Including Dom’s son Brian Jr.. Correct me if I’m writing though.
This series should have ended after 5 smh 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
Making Charlize Theron their Thanos is unearned and a very poor choice. That Star Wars scene was rough
I haven’t laughed  this hard for a long time 😂🤣🤣
I was out when Dom stomped a parking gerage into the ground...
The whole entire franchise is on crack now
F10: Fast into the multiverse.
Are we not going to talk about the Skyline?...
Cross it with transformers and then it all makes sense
You watch these types of movies, so we don't have to 👍
F9 can go F off!! What load of rubbish
F9 stunt scenes was impossible and stupid winch swinging the car around the clift pontiac fiero in outer space YYEEAAA the director smoke some good asss crack cocaine while making this movie
The tenth one will be called FX (or Special FX)
Little Brian was with Brian
In the next movie they should give them super powers.
Watching this and compare Fast 9 to MI 6 is like comparing Michellin chef to McDonald's
BTW if you didn't know BOTH, THATS RIGHT BOF, The rock and Vin Diesel have " My character can not lose a fight" clauses in their contracts. THIS MEANS EVERYTIME THE ROCK THREW A PUNCH, VIN DIESEL THREW A PUNCH. This means that A fight with Vin Diesel and the Rock always ALWAYS has to end in a draw. These are grown men.
I want Dom to join the avengers. He will be cool car man(CCM)
Grade should have been that it was “F[n]INE”
Fast 5 was f**king awful!
They are at least self aware on how ridiculous it is so that’s comforting and somewhat warrants a pass. I enjoyed my time watching it
They explained in the movie that Brian O'Connor was watching all the kids
blame it on Vin that guy is fucking crazy and he cant ever loose to the new guy no matter what i think there was drama between him and the Rock cuz Vin only wants to win so pretty much Vin is smelling his own farts thinking his the best of the best
Next movie's tag line, if not FX, will be........  Fast10 Your Seat belts!
Another F&F Ill avoid.
The way they explained Han being alive was not very good. If Han was watching in the shadows with Mr Nobody then who was the guy in Hans car?
so bad it was good...
I think we all realized the absurdity of this franchise for awhile now, not sure how it's such a surprise with this one
Plot twist: dom has been in a coma since the fast and the furious after hitting the truck and its all a dream
F10 is going to be about them getting super powers and becoming the new avengers
I can always tell if u like the film from your face on the thumbnail lol
Brian was taking care of little Brian.  Remember, Chris, Paul Walker’s character is still alive in this universe.
I went in knowing what I was getting myself into and had a good time.  I did like that some of the Tokyo drift characters returned in this one. And this one actually has me excited for FX for that last scene in the movie.
Going to space in a Virgin Galactic rocket  SPCE?  YES...sign me up.
F10 vs T_Rex (from your shirt)?   Sure...why not.
Charlize Theron needs a better script to work with when it comes to these movies. Her character is so boring and it’s not her fault
I haven't watched a full F&F movie since Tokyo Drift, but I'm pretty sure I remember cars dragging bank vault through city, a tank being flipped by a car and cars jumping from one skyscraper to another. What do they do in this one for people to call bullshit.
LOL ... I will go into it with my mind prepared... it's a comedy... lol.
Fast and Faurios 9 Dom brother Jacob Torreto (John Cena)is  Villan with Cipher (Charlie Theron).it was epic
Brian (the ghost of Paul walker) was watching Brian
In fast 5. The cars and the tanks was proven to be possible! I remember seeing a video about it.
Before I get to far into your video  Cipher doesn't enlist the help of Jakob
The principle actors in this series owe everything they have to it. 'Just show us the FAST MONEY ' could be their calling card.
The last good fast movie was F6 even that movie started to go far out with the plot. It’s just not the same without Brian.  The scene with him flying across the bridge is where I was out, the asshole couldn’t even pretend his back was hurt. Come on dude, you’re acting, you aren’t invincible
Totally agree with you. Seen it today and came out the cinema feeling quite meh.
ITS RIDICULOUS 🥴🥴😩 I knew It . WWE Smackdown.
The amount of cut scenes makes me nauseous 🤢
Fast 10 garages of the galaxy
Dom literally had an anime flash back when he was under water 😂😂😂
The only one worth anything is the first one that's actually realistic and about car racing.  These just get dumber and dumber.
FasTEN your seat belt
Fast Five is ultimately the best, next to the original. I enjoyed watching To Fast to Furious and Tokyo Drift. The 4th Fast and Furious was a great revenge movie for Dom Torretto and I couldn’t help but smile when I see Brian , Mia and the two stooges from the beginning of the movie coming to rescue Dom in the prison bus and then it cuts. But then when Fast 6 comes in it cheapens Fast and Furious 4 with Letty’s death. It also cheapens Hobbs who is supposed to be the big bad ass bounty hunter who always gets his man. There really is no reason why Brian and Dom would want to come back to live in the US after that bank heist in Fast Five. That’s my opinion. I mean the movies are entertaining but they get a little ridiculous after Furious 7.
When John cena ran vin diesels head through the wall all I could think was thats shoddy workmanship 😁
I get that it’s a driving movie but how stupid can a villain be to have there doomsday device on a moving vehicle.
They should have ended this franchise after part 7 or at least reboot it.
F9 used silly movie science
Is Chris Stuckmann wearing a Jurassic Park shirt in this review as an homage to Double Toasted's pitch for a Fast & Furious/Jurassic World crossover movie?
The “F” in F9 stands for “Family”
Agreed with the review it's just not good
F10: the war is on the moon. F11:  on Mars F12: Venus F13:Pluto F14: on new solar system
I’m a FaF fan, but I’ll wait’til video or streaming.
This movie got a lot of people killed. People mocked this movie!!
I would give the movie A 7/10 or if we're talkin letter grades a solid C. As far as the entertainment value it did what it was supposed to do but  the shock value is now gone because  all of these crazy over-the-top stunts and special-effects you're wondering how could they top it in the next movie or two. And as far as the next movie title instead of calling it "Fast X" like you suggested it going to be stylized as "Fast and Fur10us"
Look it died the last in Fast 8
They said where young Brian was and who he was with...
I thought the story was pretty amazing
Series where Idris Elba plays literally a chromed-up corporate samurai and there's a car chase through skyscrapers. Isn't there a foot chase through collapsing skyscrapers at one point? It's a blur.
I saw this with friends yesterday and it was so absolutely ridiculous that it took us out of the movie. I can't remember the last time I laughed so much in a movie theater.
1,2 and 5 were the best 4 was ok the rest was dumb,lol
I stopped watching after Paul died, after that it just got ridiculous
Dom: “Family is everything.”  Also Dom: “Lets destroy numerous families being reckless criminals.”  This franchise has definitely become a parody in recent years.
Fast and furious 1 and Tokyo drift everything else is unrelenting garbage
You know he’s not a true Car guy when he said his favorite movie is 5… not even 1 2 or 3
John cena ?! Sorry China?! C’mon...and her hair... looks like simple Jack 😂
Chris, did you watch a special version? I don't remember that fight scene between Cena and Diesel  and I just watched the movie in UK 2 hours ago. Now I need to rewatch just to look for that scene 😊 Unless they edited it...
I rlly just wanna know what the Jurassic world trailer was like
it was a bad movie
My fav movie in this franchise is definitely F5: Brock's Revenge
Go tispey thats the way to do it. Lol
Somehow someway they’ll crossover with Jurassic World & the MCU 😂😂😂
Can't wait for Fast 10, where Dom uses the power of family to drive so fast he goes back in time, preventing his father's death.   Dom's dad played by Sylvester Stallone of course....
Dom: I got my family Brian: daddy? Where were you and mummy for last 4 years of my life?
This is the one where they are in space right ?
The next logical conclusion is casting Salman Khan to the fast series.
That’s called a power play brother.
Can’t wait for that Fast and Furious Jurassic Drift.
Tokyo drift was the best. After that, movies slowly got weirder and nonsensical
I’m high as fuck watching this review lmao 🤣
Too bad John cena is a commie stooge.
Warning: the cheese is off the charts in this movie. Before seeing it there was only one fast and furious I would not see twice (you know) now there are two. Lol wow it’s pretty bad.
Honestly I had really really low expectations for this movie, but in my opinion it wasn't all that bad.  If you've stuck through the series this long, you should know what to expect by now. Honestly I thought the rocket car in the trailer was going to be like the ending scene or post credit scene for the next movie, so to see them in space for this was kinda cool.  If you saw the very first movie, Dom explains to Brian what happened to his dad.  To see that story actually unfold was pretty neat for me as well.
F10 better be it. its time.
They’re gonna team up with captain marvel in space to stop a laser that could destroy the world “for family”
I was waiting for dom to say “family” the entire time
They made a movie out of the universal studios ride
This guy is an idiot. There was a low key way Roman kept saying they were Super Heroes and that the things they did should have them in graves. It was not an oversight.
True that watch it last night.  So out there.  No relationship with this. Crash and burn.
I’m glad I didn’t pay to watch this. And even in the comfort of my home I couldn’t wait for it to end.
A Dingo ate the baby.
The last movie I watched was Fast Five. When Dom, a car mechanic physically beat a bigger and HIGHLY trained Hobbs, I was like wtf this is shit.
Has Chris somehow missed "Furious 7" where Diesel and Statham's characters were hitting each other with crowbars and getting into a full-speed head-on crash? Or "Fate of the Furious", where Dom was kicking hos whole "family's" ass, nonchalantly breaking car doors with his shoulder snd stuff?  I am yet to watch the new movie, but I feel like the previous three (including "Hobbs and Shaw" have successfully made it very clear that this one will be about superhumans and have cartoon physics. So I am kinda intrigued why Chris found this one to have gone too far.
This movie series is so ridiculous you began to root for the bad guys. The fact that they are Invicible and have no fear of death. I be mad as hell watching these unbelievable stunts
Fast and furious franchise should've been over after the second movie
This movie bored me
Review the new rurouni kenshin movie
I only liked 1 + 2, everything after that was not about the street racing scene, it just entered absurdity.  Also is sounds like you are reaching deep down to find nice things to say about this movie lol
First few movies were good, liked F7 too. But at this points its just crazy stunts followed by a bbq with corona.
They do mention what happens to Dom's son. Brian was watching all the kids. I liked this movie. Looking forward to 10 and 11
All sorts of other super human stuff: Tez and Rome in space was the least of the ridiculousness
I was laughing to myself at the ridiculousness of this movie. I swear I thought some of these characters were superhuman: how quickly they get out of danger and beat up dozens of men. It was crazy fun
Brian was babysitting young Brian and the kids a.k.a. Paul Walker’s character.   I just got back from watching the movie & the movie was actually pretty good like you just said it’s mindless fun!!   This film actually had more of a backstory which I appreciate! I think in the 11th movie they’re gonna go in the future and their young kids are going to be involved on their missions so they can make spinoffs.   Also in the movie they were very self-aware which i appreciated!  That nothing happens to them they don’t get Hurt or anything like that like Tyrese says I have no scars to prove anything after getting shot at by 14 people.
Correction Cipher never recruits Jacob in the movie .
You dont need logic You dont need script  You got family
Chris foreshadowing F10 will crossover with dinosaurs/ Jurassic Park
And the red car blew up how did in the hell did  it get Roman and Tej into space??
Franchise is WACK! They have all lost their mind and of course the Fast gang went into SPACE! GOOD LORD! Crash and Burn goes the franchise.  😂🤣☠
I think they wanted to make it clear that they are spies now and not racers (the next oceans 11 type heist crew / intelligence agency super assets)
I just kinda wonder why Charlize Theron is in a plastic cell but yet still finds time to....wake up, take a shower, put her make-up on, fix her hair, wash her clothes, press them and then put them on.
Believe it or not: This films was the first in this franchise I've ever seen. I've heard all about it's absurdities and to be honest its the most junk flavoured cinema experience I've had all year and I like great films like "A Quiet Place Part. 2" and am heaily anticipating 'Dune."
Nah fast 10 shouldn’t be called FX it has to be called fasten your seatbelts
It’s a FF movie what did you expect. They are all trash besides FF1 and FF Tokyo drift.
I wonder how much cena contributed to the stunts
I was really disappointed after watching F9. At this time i would rather see more spinoffs like Hobbs&Shaw or even better Han&Giselle one. On the other hand Han performed really weak in this movie like he didn't care so i don't know.
It's time to start my F9 movie review tour.  It started with Double Toasted, now Stuckmann, Jeremy Jahns is next....
Producers of this movie: Fucking A guys, we are out of ideas, we've driven in straight lines, circles, backwards, fucking sideways. GOD DAMMIT WHAT ELSE IS THERE.  Other producer: uhhh the internet wants us in space.
I now regret buying tickets for this movie and I'm about to leave home in like 5 minutes
Why must John ruin every movie Man shit
Since the original, Dom has always stressed how important family is and now he has a brother we don't know about.... hmmm, yep, ya lost me and the fact it's John Cena is the worst fucking casting they could do. The Fast saga officially ended after 7. 8 was not needed and 9 is an obvious stretch at pleasing a specific market that isn't the one they got popular off of. Can i get "sell outs' for 500 Alex?
Trash
Okay so I just got done watching this movie. And not to shit all over it but this was probably the worst movie ever made... Definitely of the franchise. This movie literally made me cringe physically out loud, thank God the theater was so loud because I was very vocal about my distaste. This was bad storytelling bad acting and it's getting so ridiculously meta that it's insufferable. How are all of your actions scenes going to 100% defy the laws of physics and then you're going to have a line in the movie about obeying the laws of physics... I'm sure Justin Lin is a competent filmmaker but it feels like Vin Diesel is the one that writes all these stories and they just get crazier and stupider. It's lost the soul, the narrative. Like I can't turn my brain off I'm sorry people always extol movies for that virtue, it's something you can just turn your brain off and watch... Like no If I'm going to turn my brain off something else has to take its place with some kind of intelligence! It's like telling me to turn my brain off while Trump is talking You can't It's a train wreck!
The physics in Fast9 are ridiculous lol
Generally think this guy doesn't have the best opinions & is heavily influenced by popular opinion. Couple minutes in & he is wrong about the whole Brian thing. The space thing is actually somewhat believable. At any rate, think everyone can agree that this movie was ridiculous & hurts the franchise. Guess every movie Cena is in has a 99% chance of not being good.
This movie reminds me of the room I laughed so hard at how stupid it was
Fast 27 (Dom & the family vs the Decepticons) "The Autobots have fallen"
They lost me at 5. Why isn't a ridiculous car movie enough? Maybe I'm a boomer now.
I can’t explain why I enjoyed Hobbs and Shaw but possibly hated this
Grade:  D
..... It was sooooo boring.
To the ones who doesn’t like Fast 9:  Hey, at least we saw a 5 minutes Jurassic World Dominion preview
Absolute mockery of cinema in every tangible way.
Where we want to watch full movie
They said that Brian was beinh take care off and that he was in good hands if you didn’t hear
Nice frank review. 👍
Which FF movie had the ending on the runway with a fast moving plans for 10 minutes. How long is that runway?
Unless you are 14 years old, why do you watch this franchise? Number 1 was ok, it's was borderline stupid back then with the 17 gear changes and the foot barely touching the throttle until "go faster" so it's now down to the floor. etc  Grown men watch this? Don't get me wrong I love superhero movies but they are comic books.
Things that need to happen for the end of the franchise: The death of Cipher- the return of M.Nobody- an explanation between Han & Deckard- the retirement or the REAL death of Dom. And finally, Brian's return and he should have the last line of the franchise because he had the first line of the franchise... just to end the cycle.
"F9 feels like a setup movie for another movie and thats very dissapointing" 🤣
I thought it was a part of the mcu I mean like Dom must be a super soldier he can take on 20 trained soldiers 😂
The physics of this movie does not make sense. By the way, they explicitly said Don's kid was with Brian.
A C???? bruh ur too generous
Fast and Furious is just an action movie on steroids lol can’t wait for it to become a spin-off into Transformers and Vin Diesel becomes Optimus Prime 😂🤣😂
FasTEN your seatbelts
F10:They shrink to microscopic scale and battle the covid-19 virus.
A non horror movie franchise that has more sequels than the Friday the 13th series which is 40 years old! Yeah people that like this shit are simpletons and have absolutely 0 standards.
Shonen has the power of friendship fast and furious has the power of family
The temporary philippines intialy close because riverbed characteristically fail unto a disastrous silk. untidy, dull market
Chris, where did you get your shirt??? I love it!!! And I need it
Fast 10: For the Family
They were supposed to go to cybortron
i love that bobby lee mentions your channel in his podcast. I've been watching both of you for a while now and i'm  so glad i could hear your name on his show. he respects you a lot
They are preparing for the  fast and Furious  ENDGAME
The many bankbook neurophysiologically replace because shoulder luckily instruct despite a abandoned nylon. maniacal, cut packet
Chris is Right F9 completely lost me...literally! It was so cheesey and these guys have become Super Heroes...
We're getting a lot of C's this year...
I just want a tokyo drift type of movie again
Oh Chris, bless your kind heart. Giving a C+ 🤤 when you know the movie barley and kindly can only make it to a D.
Fast 10 will take place in space.  They will have cars that can go to space.
One word to describe fast 9............Family.
if F10 is the real end of the saga, i want them to go full blown, kooky. Like, time travel, punch dinosaurs and operate Gundam mechs. Just go out with the biggest bang u can guys
F12 Dom fights Aliens with FTL ships
This is Universal's "Avengers." I'd be more okay with the Jurassic Park X Fast & Furious Collab rumour at this point.
I have to agree. It’s way overboard
Next movie Avengers vs the fast and the furious
I'm Pretty sure 90% of the fans know it's not just street races and fist fights. I don't think it wouldn't be a F&F if there wasn't any unrealistic scenes. In the original F&F you had where they somehow beat a train with a charger and supra and then flipped unrealisticly by a tractor trailer. In 2F2F they jumped a lake from land in a 69 Camaro onto a yacht. In Tokyo they all drifted perfectly without hitting a single person at the most busy intersection. In 4 they stole gas trailers and stole a pretty well known drug dealer without getting caught until almost to the boarder. In 5 they stole cars off a train without being noticed by the police who was on the train. In 6 they stopped a huge plane with harpoons and cars. In 7 they were jumping buildings. In 8 they stopped a nuclear sub with a single rocket and finally in 9 they went to space. Every movie has had the impossible happen.
These movies ... Eh ... Just a bit too ridiculous ... F6 is what took it to stupid. So ... no more for me. And the "family" is more ... bro-family frat boy crap. Meh.
There is a scene with Ramon that felt like a Will E Coyote cartoon scene.
Fast 9 still looks nothing like Fast and Furious. It’s just heist, war, villains, spy and hacking. There was no illegal street racing. Fast 9 made me bored
C+ for me
I’m not mad at the actors nor movie producers. I’m mad at people like Chris who intentionally went to check out the film in cinemas. LmAo
Big Brian was watching little Brian
Fast furious all female version coming soon.... I'm not joking directed by Vin diesel .... I'm serious
Look i think they did more super hero stuff but i like how we get to know more about there backgrounds. Han was brought back because of popular demand. I do miss the og type of movie but this was not the worst or even bad movie i loved it.
I love how Chris cuts away when he starts laughing 😆
That 1-2 second pause around 1:22 said IT ALL lol!  I knew what that meant when I felt it lol.  When I left out the movie earlier, I was a little confused.  I didn't like or hate the movie.  Then I realized that I am now numb to these FF movies.  I'm tired of them now.  I was tired when 8 came out and thought that was EXTREMELY ridiculous!
80 pounds of shit in a 5 pound bag
Have anyone notice that we never get to see Dom’s brother throughout the movie?
Where did the kid Brian go ya ask. They say in the movie that big Brian is watching all the kids while Mia is out chasing her brother. "Pay Attention" So big Brian has his two & Dom's.
Vi va la the COUNTRY of Taiwan, Cena.
We’re all family at the Olive Garden with their unlimited breadsticks
Tokyo drift was my favourite
Glad I ain't watching F9 🤣🤣
Ten seconds car... remember?!  i miss that!
I don’t think we watched the same movie. Your synopsis is off. The progression of the action and events falls in line with where they’re taking it. Might wanna rewatch it and correct some of your facts though.
They didn't abandoned Baby Brian. They mentioned that Brian was babysitting
I would agree with you. Except when I watched the movie I wasn't watching it as a comedy, I was watching it as a F&F movie.  Maybe it's just me, but the things you and even John Campea said about the outlandish stuff that stood out in the film didn't necessarily bothered me one bit. Mainly because when watching the film I wasn't watching to find things to nitpick about, I was watching to see how everything played out.  F&F had always been a franchise that was known for over the top set pieces, so when I watched the movie just to view the issues people had, I was watching and thinking "what exactly am I seeing that f&f hasn't done before?".  I feel that people are going to be harsher on these films now going forward due to them now realizing how over the top these films can be, and F9 in my opinion hasnt been any different than what has come before (I mean they literally fought a submarine in the last film and had a bunch of cars being controlled by the female villains hacking software rolling out of buildings just to chase the heroes. Also didn't Hobbs and Shaw pretty much introduced cybernetic superpowers? C'mon, the franchise exited the realm of realism way before F9 decided to go to outer space.)
The family from A Quiet Place came to take care of Bryan…so naturally they all died.
They clearly know it doesn't make sense but it still gets people in seats an talking about it an let's be real its entertaining
When they went to space I got up and left the theater. Doing too much.
Fast and Furious is the new The Room. Except multiple installments.
Paul Can't Walk..
So many ppl bring up the bank vault scene not knowing that most of that scene is filmed practically.
Hobb and shaw or f9?
I watched it at universal citywalk theater, so the car from the franchise was great, but maybe thats to apologize to see how bad it is. its a great looking movie, this is a straight up bad bollywood movie, i loved the others in the franchise, this one, felt stale, but if you smoked weed before you watched it like me, you will have alot of fun, if not, it feels like a 2 year old wrote the script, and random stuff happens, and the story makes no sense, cartoons are better than this, and there has always been a spy aspect in the furious franchise, in the beginning, in 2001, paul walker character works for the police and they would have a tv that shows what the mission will be, so they always had the aspect, it just didnt feel like nothing, now for kids that are maybe in the 1st grade or lower will like this, not me, but how ever stupid this is, it can make you laugh the end credit makes no sense, but just know what you are going in to and you will be okay, and yeah i know bond went to space, so did they, but somewhat in moonraker it made sense, here there was really no point, this is a poor mans mission impossible james bond movie, but kids will like it that wants to watch a live action cartoon, i cant wait to watch NTTD please be better than this, thats all i ask, this is an easy paycheck for everyone, the brother cliche is so bad, it makes spectre brother love so much better. and then just to many things happening that you might enjoy that but thats about it, lucas black sean boswell can be the new paul walker if they want, or a replacement, but yeah i miss paul walker in these films, i dont know why, but i can feel it, but not all the F&F movies are bad, i think the ones that has paul walker in it, are great, and tokyo drift is great, but this one is not great even on weed, you laugh at how dumb this is, but its okay its not for me just like as a bond or spy fan, die another day is not either. this is basically Die Another Day the franchise. But it did give me an idea of having john cena replace tom cruise in mission impossible when tom cruise doesnt want the franchise no more, they can make a faithful adaptation of the sixities show, because cena can play jim phelps the actor who played him in the show, looks similar to john cena, so john cena with white hair would be great, or john cena as a villian in MI8 would be great, having watched all of kojak a universal property they can give vin diesel a movie adaptation of that show, cause i can see disel do that. I miss the racing aspect of the franchise. i miss dwane johnson in these movies, i understand the fallout between him and vin that is why they did the spinoff hobbs and shaw and also dont see him in this movie, but to dwane fight cena, if they ever went that route would be great, i would love to see them have a wwe fight again in movie form, i grew up on john cena fighting in the early 2000s, and then dwane as well, so that would have been cool if we got that, but i agree with everything you said.
Fast and furious finished for me when Paul Walker died.
This is stupid. I Don't want to turn off my brain to have fun...
There's an actual street race in the movie so that's a plus
Thank you
Saw the movie, they legit go to space and destroy a satellite
They trying there best because Paul’s gone rip Paul walker... Mia came to action and let Paul watch the kids..... Brian would’ve never went for that.... we miss him tho
I really wanted to love F9, but the second I heard Han was coming back, I knew this movie was going to have problems, so that killed a bit of enthusiasm. I loved Fate of the Furious, I loved Hobbs and Shaw, I went to watch this one... It had moments, but the plot was just bland and forgettable, not to mention predictable. I was beyond skeptical about introducing Dom's brother after 8 or 9 movies, but he actually worked and was probably the best part of the movie.  Spoilers for anyone who cares: Jakob captures Cipher, and she begins to mess with him mentally. The second that happened, I knew she was going to double cross him at some point. She did, and it was just "whatever". I stopped caring by the time Han re-entered the picture. Him coming back was nonsensical fan service, and nothing more.  I was also disappointed in the lack of Brian. I get that they can't do much without Paul, but with Caleb and Cody and a few body doubles, something could've been done. I was expecting Cipher to go after Brian and kill him, in revenge for what happened during Fate of the Furious, which would explain why Mia is with the group in the movie... Nope, Brian gets a couple of mentions, Cipher does next to nothing in the story, and the real bad guy may be the most forgettable bad guy the series has ever had.  I'm still getting it on DVD, I kinda have to at this point, since I have everything else, but right now, this is my second least favourite in entire series, only ahead of Tokyo Drift.
I loved it, I just got back. These movies are so fun and over the top.
My god the part where Dom’s head breaks right through the door frame and he’s perfectly fine smh.
F10.... Time travel
I would die of laughter if they had a race war on Saturn's rings.
@1:56 reason why i stopped watching or paying attention to the series, its too surreal
I think they said that Brian stayed back to take care of the two kids
Tyrese never says anything about super heroes. Just about being invincible but tej shoots the idea out of his head.
😣 they were in space wearing scuba gear........F-
It's crazy hobs and shaw was probably better.
All they had to do...all they had to do. Was introduce Aliens into the movie and have a car that was a UFO Hybrid and fly it into space. That would have made sense and been cool. Then they could have had special cars in F10 and take the franchise in a new direction.
Picture 3 Stooges meeting Laurel and Hardy, that's what I picture in Sean, Tweek, Tuner guy and Roman and Tej
F5 & F7 was the best
Fast 9 was damn ropey
Are they racers or super soldiers? 😂😂😂
baby brian was with brian in the movie lol
Nice Review of F9. This review looks more of a rant to me than a review. Also, I adore this amazing Jurassic Park parody shirt, it looks amazing.
The roasted children conspicuously rhyme because methane pharmacologically chew qua a attractive polyester. crooked, shrill cougar
These movies suck! Never got into them
How can you see John Cena?
remember when fast 1 was a somewhat thrillery cop movie where the main character is undercover and falls in love with his suspects sister? lets just say that watching all the movies back to back is an experiense in escalation.
Review Howl's moving castle 2004
Fast and Furious 10! The search for the Infinity Gauntlets!
FAMILY.
I watched this movie to count the number of times Dom says Family
They literally said Brian (Paul Walker character) had all the kids
Fast & Furious 10: Vin Diesel and crew go into space to fight alien robot cars. You know what that means? Transformer crossover confirmed!
Why was vin diesel floating onto a wall
I absolutely loathe these movies, i hate them with a passion, just absolute trash
Fast 10 : rick sanchez
i hate this franchise so much, it demonstrates perfectly how divoid hollywood is of any idea how to make a good movie. i loved the first movie...but the rest of them sucked hard...its just a joke
The powerful oak socioeconomically announce because step-daughter genotypically fold throughout a little interviewer. tense, heavenly heavy hellish banker
Do you need to use the "f" word?
Gotta be honest I lost interest in these films a long time ago, Terrible acting and ridiculous stunts.
I'm old enough to have seen F1 in the theater. By chance   I thought F1 was a comedy, but then just went with it.  They live in a sim and get powerups each episode they complete
Fast 10: dom and friends find out that doms dad is actually alive and was kidnapped right before his car exploded by a secret organization ran by shaws dad and is far too powerful for them to safely get his dad back so dom, Shaw, cena, and friends team up to go back in time to rescue their dad right before he is kidnapped!
The fast and the furious franchise is if they actually made all those movies that they teased at the end of 22 Jump Street
6:08 If its not called Fast 10: Your seatbelts... I aint watching it.
I'm not even mad they made it so absurdly over the top.  What angers me is how boring it all is.  I wasn't on the edge of my seat even once.  And it felt LONG.   At least Hobbs and Shaw had some excellent one liners and chemistry.
Yeah..John Cena begging for the Chinese Communist Party’s forgiveness is a deal breaker.
I genuinely enjoyed the movie; F8 didn’t do it for me. This is an awesome parody for all the boomers shitting on the fast series for not being realistic and for not being about sTrEet rAcIng 🥴
eesh. 3 Cs in a row - reminds me of my middle school report card.
Honestly when Tyrese was saying they were invincible in the trailer I was so sure he was going to get killed in this movie. Guess I expected to much from the franchise
It's the worst part
Yea the fast and furious franchise If focused on family and local crimes like it did at the start might have ended up a more serious an dramatic movie series which I would have preferred at this point because let’s face it it’s not as good as it use tobe... the characters, and story lines that the franchise once started with is now entirely absent... it’s like everything after movie number 5 is like else world events like what if kind of shit you know the true ending to this movie franchise to me was and always will be Fast 5
Wait, John Cena is playing Vin Diesel’s *younger* brother??
This movie is a big expensive joke! Just like Hollywood itself!! 👎
I watched F9 last night in it's Advanced World Premiere here in NYC. I agree with everything you said. It was basically a Comedy throughout. And Vin Diesel (Dominic) younger character looked more like Cena than Vin.
Meanwhile  in the upcoming years  F20 furious Multiverse toreto's madness      🧐
Can’t believe there are still people who pay to watch these F&F movies... they are literally making it up as they go and not in a good way... these are not even worth watching for free from torrent lol...
Avengers: We have a hulk   Toretto: We have family
If they brought back Han, then they can surely bring back Jesse.  Or maybe they have. I've only seen 1, 3, and 5.
F10 needs to be called "Fast 10 your seatbelts"
I refuse to watch it.
They all have Black Widow's fighting prowess and the power of Thor
Hollywood on life support
What is helen mirren doing in this crap
So what you're saying is, this is the Resident Evil 8 of fast and the furious movies
Fast & Hilarious 9
Man that was disappointing... I think they start to lost it on Hobbs & Shaw. I hate that movie because it's ridiculously sci-fi while all other FF movies have been held back in reality.
I think this film is most difficult to believe if you have been suspending your belief this long. It's been a physics ignoring comedy since the 2nd one for me. I cannot believe you were still holding out hope after 6~8 lol. Still, fair points :D
I always see the movies as an anime i think it makes it more enjoyable idk why
FX is a cool title but, I if it's not called "Fast 10 Your Seat belts" I will be rather upset 🤣🤣
Fast10 your seatbelts for a wild ride
This is seen in movie version of The A-Team, I can't necessarily remember if it was in the show but they basically find a way to make a tank fly, or at the very least fall with style, I remember how ridiculous that was but how much I truly enjoyed it, the Fast & Furious franchise I don't know just feels empty.
I totally understand your issues with the movie, but honestly everything you describe just makes me more excited to see it
Remember when The Fast & the Furious was all about illegal street racing. Yeah me neither.
Wow...this review is spot on. I feel exactly the same way about this movie, I agree 100%. Fate of the Furious was not a good movies...but this film officially lost me. F9 It's the single most ridiculous movie I've ever seen.
With Cena in it, I’m glad to see this movie is China approved
it was so bad that it was good
This is more like f8.5. Return of Han Solo, using the force, Yoda, and in space.
TH!S MOV!E W!(( !NTERTA!N           SPEC!AL ...K!DS... JUST~SAY!N SHOULD OF STOP AT...(F5)...
Rule of 9. When a franchise reaches it’s 9th movie, you’ve gone too far.
at some point of the future I'm sure there will be a fast and furious time travel movie
Yeah they are missing the writer like Hobs & Shaw wasnt total bullshit😂😂😂
When they lost Paul Walker, they lost the whole franchise. Walker was the heart of the movie saga, not Diesel.
Not a good franchise. I just tolerated them.
brian is looking after brian there is a line in film
Han was in fast and furious 6 and 5, so he has already returned from the Dead.
that space scene was dumb
Felt just like you, I laughed for the wrong reasons and shook my head at almost every scene it truly felt like this movie was made by and for memes
Fast and Furious went to shit after 5
Dont you dare disrespect vins head. Hé is a monster!!
These movies aren't supposed to make sense. They're far fetched thrill rides made simply for fun. I understand that's not everyone's cup of tea, but they're not meant to be taken seriously.
There will be a 10. It will include the spirits of characters from the past. Very much like the spirits of past Jedi masters.
More cartoony then Space Jam... and thats amazing!!!!!!  TERRETOS kid was left with a sitter a block away.... and that was the first time that kid was actually SAFE.... somebody needs to call children services and save that child.
I wish someone would have said ... you get stupider the more you watch any of the fast franchise movies during the first 1... but by 9 ... it isn't stupid anymore... scientists don't have a word for it. Oh and it be nice if someone could teach Vin Diesel what family means. He keeps throwing that word around as if it means something to him and his band of merry morons! Even Michael Bay stopped his Transformers imbecile showcase 5 movies in.
🚀🌌
I kept replaying 4:46 i'm sorry behehahaha
Cant wait for the crossover with Guardians of the Galaxy
2:38 wow that’s pretty insensitive to make a joke about “Brian” being in a coffin/wooden box. Pretty clear joke about Paul Walker/Brian being dead.
It looks terrible just like all the other films in the franchise.
C- on the generous side.  Worst Fast & furious movie imo
This one was the weakest of the franchise, it needed a dose of Rock/Statham, Vin can't carry this alone after Paul and Hobbs & Shaw was better then F9, felt like they were trying to out do Hobb & Shaw the entire time
It was explained where Brian went
Why even review it for as long as you did. That thumbnail said everything you need to know. It looks like it hurt 🤕
These movies got so dumb. They need to stop
It's trash. You're welcome.
The Discount Avengers....as I call them
As a huge fan of the series, it was just awful.
“...which-“ I agree Chris.
the next one should actually be called "Fas10 Your Seatbelts"
The best driver in the series is the designated babysitter now. Lmao smh RIP Paul Walker🙏🏾
F10: Dom teams up with satan to fight an alien force in space, flying cars in space.
10th installment will be on another planet that is the key to time travel and everyone will be wearing capes.... or It will have a talking dog or dinosaur and they battle Megatron
I haven't watched one of these since 6 and I feel I am smarter for making that choice.
I feel that they got a huge budget and they just wanted to literally, go all in! (Even if it doesn't make sense). I hope that if they actually do FX, they would stop it right there, honestly.. or convert it officially to a Si-Fi/ Comedy Movie. I would stop at FX and create a new type of sequel, named F&F origin, and go back to the basics with new actors and similar to the first movies with REALSTIC stuff... or  at least a combination of Tokyo Drift with the  F&F one or something.
In fast and furious 26 they will be racing with aliens from other planets. In fast and furious 41 they will traveling through space and time. And in fast and furious 56 they will be racing with interdimensional beings. And in fast and furious 68 they will be racing with Paul walker in paradise. And in fast and furious 83 they will be racing with prophets of God and try to break the law of the universe. And in fast and furious 100 they will be racing against God, but sadly this time God wins and punish Dom and his team and Dom's team understand their mistake but God dont forgive Dom and sends him to rule Hell as a punishment and they become the next rulers in hell like Satan and try corrupt the God's creation and peoples. LOL 😆 🤣 😂.
Im wondering who the fu** watch these kind of shitty movies
At this its like a bollywood movie
F2 nd F5 is the best in the franchise.
Um.. where can I get that shirt?
Well FX should have em in transformers cars...haha
Wait how the hell was this *ONLY* a C-? lol
“They actually lost me on this one”
I hate to say it, but this movie is shitty
Yep it's utter shit. Just like the country that funded it. When are we going to start calling Hollywood out for their ties to the CCP. They are using slaves.
C- Hahahhahaah..
Sounds like the Die Hard trajectory.
Toretto: it's all about family Shaw & Hobbs: Let's play babysitter for Brian  2022 Movie of the year: Shaw & Hobbs: The Babysitter
They should have stopped making these movies at 7 when Paul Walker died. It's just not the same anymore.
Chris "This film it knows exactly what it is" Stuckmann
Brian is babysitting Brian
Weird ...the rock joins fast and the furious and it becomes pretty great entertainment...the rock sits this one out andddd...dogshit
I can't believe they've made 9 of these shit movies
Is Luke Evans in it?
I genuinely go to see these movies to make fun of them, and that's what I'm paying for. Can't argue, they're a good time 😂
Thanos Snapped, Tony still Alive  Thanos: What? How are you still alive?  Tony: I have family
It does not seem that you have watched the actual movie but you are just making comments based on the trailer. This fails as a movie review.
Nothing, NOTHING can top Diesel vs Rock fight
Okay, but can we talk about the Star Wars argument? It didn’t need to be added to the movie😂
Cypher does not enlist Jacob.
It’s should call “Fast End” for the next movie, then they gonna travel back through time and fix some shit like “End Game”
The next movie needs to be called FastTen your seat belts
Whenever you realize that these characters are anime and cartoon characters then you start to really appreciate and love these films because that is exactly what they are and I'm here for every minute of it
Suprised stuckman likes these movies. They're turn off your brain bad
FasTEN your seatbelts
It's not the same without Paul Walker.
I've already seen a mindless movie in Army of the Dead, I didn't need another one.
Fast and Furious 9: In space.
At this point The Avengers are overated to save the world from alien invasion.. We now have The Fast and Furious Family
C-???? How?? You barely said anything positive about the movie yet it still gets a C-  You know the movie is trash so why the high score? Btw, Alien Resurrection is awesome yet you trashed that flick. Cmon dude
*The whole series is about family but you don't even get to hear about Dom's brother until the 9th one*
The thumbnail expression is hilarious.
Wasn't there already a movie (and sequel) called FX?
Maybe they should just make Fast and Furious meets John Wick!
Thumbnail face says it all
1   is the best  And 5 is great also the rest is shit
I have never seen a FF movie…
Is this new "The Room"??
Vin Diesel's lost black ops CIA military brother ... who is younger than him ... who has been "living in the shadow" trying to surpass his brother all his life ... while his brother was busting DVD players and street racing while Cena would have been in his teens ... not to mention his father being burned in the car but Cena would have been absent.  Who cares though, fun movies.
Toretto is a Terminator. There can be no other explanation for how he survives what he does without a scratch or a serious mark on his light coloured shirts. What laundry products does this guy use???
Cmon man, C- is too generous for that
2:26 They literally say that Brian (Paul Walker version) is looking after baby Brian.
F-19
I thought it was good.. As ridicilous as it was, i accept it because that is what Fast and Furious now is. I thought it was funny, i loved the action scenes. I'll give it an 8/10 the reason is because, i hated some of the scenes, hated the part were roman took out 14 dudes with an ak, and no one was able to hit him, and then i hated the fact that you had to wait for so long until you were given an explanation of what happen to little B after Dom and Letty left. And the explanation was so short i don't blame you if you missed it, but apperantly he was with Brian.
that  sigh at 7:55 XD
F10 will be  just the The Rock, John Cena and Vin Diesel in a steel cage fighting to the death with various car parts against robotic snakes.
honestly I was done with this franchise at 5. But 3 is still the best film out of all of them for me.
It's all about family in these movies riiiight? Leti and Dom finally settle to have a kid, it's all good and snug, call comes in Leti drops the baby and says: lets go we have to do this. Yeah it's all very relatable and they are not grasping at straws with Cena and Cardi B ffs nooooooooo for sure not.
Plain trash after Fast Five😂😂 F6 TANK AND AIRPLANE, F7 FLYING CAR, F8 SUBMARINE, F9 FLASHBACK AND SPACE, F10 MARS😂😂😂
We need to have an ethics debate about them bringing Paul Walker back in 10
I was watching Tokyo drift earlier today since it was just on and i just got hooked again and watched the whole thing. I'll take watching han and Sean being absolute badass drifters over this one (as well as the last 4 to 5 movies lol).
I promised myself to never see any fast and furious franchise anymore and when i thought i was kinda exaggerating my words back then, it actually isn't lel... Even some of my friends said they should have done what i said to myself wkwk
Bryan looks after Bryan. They mention it
I just saw it, and it was absolutely terrible.  Cipher survives the final battle and Paul Walker's car shows up at Dom's BBQ right before the credits roll up.  Saved ya'll $15!!!
Fast saga are basically transofrmers without critics having Michael Bay to hate on, so they "love it".
I thought I was the only one who thought these movies where laughable
Please do hilariousoity
I thought it was always a comedy lol
After nine films and losing Paul Walker, the franchise is bound to slip and have a wacky installment. I mostly enjoy them and the last eight have been entertaining. Hopefully F10/FX will take them back into space and through time...  Vin Diesel riding a fucking Tyrannosaurus Rex!
✨‼️SPOILER‼️S✨  - - - Brian (kid) was with Brian (Paul)
I’m excited to see it. I’m a big fan & love all the movies. I enjoy it & throw physics out the window & just get lost in a rules don’t apply, lol. Screw reality, it’s good to get away & lost in a cool & silly movie. A friend for my birthday this year  gave me a lego version of Dom’s Charger. Literally lego currently has a Dom’s lego set! Thanks to that I’m into lego Technic & Speed Champion sets. Lmao 🤣 WTF  😏
This is hollow man movie, the antagonist is invisible. I can't see him
They should combine the franchise with Transformers
Remember they are planning on crossing over with Jurassic world.
F9 is a real movie, its not real. And its 9x fast that you can 4get it.
Tokyo Drift is still the only one I watch religiously
F9 was okay, it's the most absurd movie which is saying a lot and the plot was messy.
who ever Vin Diesel comes in contact with... they become family ... No matter if he is Even a beggar ... if he is in the frame of the movie .... opposing vin diesel .... they become family .... TOTAL BULLSHIT ...And the stunts ..... wow ... they are like avengers now ... CRAP
C- is very generous.
F10 gal Gadot returns as wonder woman
So 8 movies about FAMILY....and never even mention his real-blooded BROTHER... They lost me....IN SPACE
Can we please get Steven Seagull in the next fucking movie, Steven Seagull kills Dom Teredo.
The Next Avengers!!!!!!
Watched it in cinemas yesterday, so worth it, the sheer ridiculousness was amazing, so bad, no logic. I was a bit disappointed there wasn’t any actual car building.
This would definitely be a hilariocity if it was an older film
I love when Chris cracks himself up. Great review as always. 😃✌🏽
Wait didn't they say that Brian was taking care of little Brian?
Brian was babysitting Brian, come on Chris
Thx for the ad before the spoiler gave me time to click off
Fast and the Furious is a Tokusatsu. Next movie it's a Cross over with Transformers.
Think they said Brian was with Brian and his son lol
My review is 6/10 because of unreleastic action
I just subscribe to your honest review thank you
John ( "They love me", "They love me") Sena  will never get a red cent out of my pockets.
Bad move not putting it on demand same day as opening  they could make so much more money
I really hope the Rock show up in the end to challenge John Cena. Thrice in a lifetime !!! Just imagine the build  up for next years Wrestlemania
F Nine? More like F Nein
watched the original not to long ago.. was refreshing to see it was kind of grounded in physics and rules of human biology... and it was about the cars...
I was cracking up in the last like half of the movie. I could hear plenty of other people in the theater laughing too.
Chris’s face made me click this video. 😂😂
I can't wait for this movie, but you made me worried as to how good it will be.
A couple of weeks ago I came up on a bridge that was out so I bungee jumped the car across the span. Nothing unrealistic there.
Yeah yeah yeah, another BS movie in a bad franchise...sooo how was the Jurassic World "trailer"?
yeah f8 already lost me without paul walker and dwayne johnson I just don't care
Where & how to watch
F9 has now become GTA Online
I wasn't planning on seeing this shit anyways I gave up after part 6, instead of calling it F9 its more like Eff This.
I felt like this movie insulted my intelligence
6:10 hahahhaha
So, I totally understand what you’re saying. But I loved it 😂. And I actually did tear up a few times during it lol. I thought they played the emotions well. I had stayed away from the trailers and articles so a lot that happened really surprised me in a good way. I also grew up watching soap operas where people coming back from the dead is just par for the course 😂. Overall, this is one of my favorites. I liked the flashback scenes and I’m happy the Rock wasn’t in it 😬 because I’m over his sense of humor (Hobbs and Shaw really did me in).  If I rewatch it enough though, I’m sure more of what you said will bother me. Watching them all tends to show the errors of the newer ones.
I Thought this movie was badass! Can't wait for fur10us
Fast and Furious movies don't need a logical review. You will melt your brain trying to make sense of these movies. Just Turn your brain off and imagine they are superheroes. We all know this. lol
Personally while this movie isn’t the greatest I still had a fine time with it, all the lead characters are still charming and entertaining, John Cena was really good as Dom’s brother, it has some really fun action scenes, and to my surprise I didn’t really feel The Rock’s absence, when I heard he wasn’t gonna be in this movie I was initially thinking that it would feel totally empty without him and that it wouldn’t work but shockingly it did, I never thought about him once after the main story kicked in, it does have some absurdity in the action sequences but as someone who likes to laugh at the absurd moments in these movie I actually got a kick out of them, the big issues I have with it are that I felt like they didn’t need to bring Charlize Theron back, they could’ve just had John Cena be the main villain and that’s it, not to mention that this time around she was a lot more boring, she wasn’t exactly the greatest villain ever in Fate Of The Furious but she was pretty good, here I felt like I forgot about her every time she wasn’t onscreen, similarly I found the return of Han to be rather unnecessary, on top of the fact that I’ve just never really cared about his character to begin with thus when I heard he was in this movie I didn’t care the actual explanation about how he survived was just so sloppy, it felt like something they just made up on the spot rather than something they thought long and hard about, even though they act like it was something they planned, and to the people who were all excited about seeing him in this movie let me tell you he’s not in the movie very much, I’m not kidding, he doesn’t come into the movie until like the end of the second act, so ultimately it felt like they just threw him into the movie as audience bait, but still, I had a decent time with this movie, it’s definitely my least favorite of the Fast and Furious movies I’ve seen but I don’t quite think I’d count it as a bad movie either, it still has fun action, the characters are still entertaining, it’s a pretty big drop in quality compared to the 5-8 movies but I don’t quite think it crosses the threshold into bad territory. 6/10
Haha that F9 keyboard in the beginning
Brian (Paul Walker) was watching Brian (child) as well as his own kid
Fast 13 will take place on Friday the 13th and feature the family take down Jason Vorhees
i have   a  collection of   fast 2  furous movies  on  dvd to  thanks for sharing    maybe they will  have 20 more films
I've never seen a TFTF movie.  I rode the ride at Universal Studios.  I feel like this is for retards and the Walmart crowd.
They said Brian was babysitting Brian, but yeah this movie was ass🤣🤣🤣
I'm trying to figure out what Chris' shirt says, I know it's a "Jurassic Park" reference. Visit "Islanudlar"??
The absurdity is almost on par with a south indian movie, it’s hilariously bad!😂
How are you going to wear that shirt and not address it? You know what you're doing.
They could have called this F:IX
I stopped taking them seriously about 4-5 movies ago tbh so every example he described to make it sound bad I'm just like "Yeah Idgaf that sounds amazing".
Bank vault scene was real 🤣
Fast 10: We race fucking aliens and end up in the Marvel universe
Mia told Dom that her kids are in the safest place in the world with Brian O’Conner and baby Brian, so that’s who was watching the kids
I can't wait for Fast 10 vs The Expendables that'll be intriguing.
Brian was watching the kids Mia says that when she first shows up to help out
This franchise lost me at 7.
Why?
4:12 - 4:50 So, they're like Terminators now. Neat 😂.
Hans died like twice now
Fast 1 to 3 is my top fav🔥🔥
I’m glad I stopped at 7. That will always be the true ending in my opinion
2:15 😂😂😂
I think everyone misses what they was doing. WWE+Fast cars+explosions+huh?= 🤔
The bank vault was actually a practical stunt by the way
I've been wondering why people want an arm and a leg for old Pontiac Fieros right now. Mystery solved. I wasn't going to watch this one but seeing as they included one of those hidden gems of automobiles (provided you give that gem a motor/transmission combo worthy of the chassis) I'm gonna check it out now. Seriously, a mid-engined, rear wheel drive, light weight affordable  two seater by 1908s era Pontiac?
That Need for Speed movie is my favourite F&F. It's just a far better car movie with better characters.
The space scene was hilarious
Normally I’d find these films to be outlandish. Then again, the original film shares its title with a film from Roger Corman, the king of B movies. Let that sink in.
*can wait for cinemasins to sin this film!!*
I have a crush on Helen Mirren. Was she good in it atleast?
I stopped watching this series a long time ago. At this point, it’s the equivalent of Armageddon. Which I think is a cheesy and Over-Americanized movie. Back when I first watched Armageddon, I thought it was the best film ever. However, then I realized that was a big waste of film.  That’s the same premise with the Fast and the Furious films. The first 4 installments were really good, the fifth movie in my opinion was a disappointment and went downhill from there.
In FX I hear they might go against dinosaurs.  Jurassic park crossover 😂😂😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️  I’m glad it’s not just me.  I was done after F8.  Ludicrous and Tyrees fighting over the new girl, Hacking into and driving cars off roofs remotely,  The Rock tearing a concrete sink out of a prison wall and doing curls with them. It just got to be ridiculous. F9 it looks like is only worse. Maybe I’ll come out of my Covid den and go to the theater when Halloween Kills comes out F9 isn’t that movie that’s going to do it.
“Who’s babysitting Brian?”  My money’s on the Charmin bears.
Me: when did the logic start to leave the series? Vin Diesel: You don’t need logic when you gots family. Me: Get the hell out of my house.
Yes. I want the 9th movie in the franchise to filled with flashbacks and setting up the next movie.
I swear if it wasn't for these movies most of these actors wouldn't have careers.
The bank vault scene was when it became a parody to me. Laughed throughout and at the implication The Rock would have trouble beating down Vin Diesel.
F 1 - part zillon 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴🙄😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
They should send John Cena to beg you for forgiveness and acceptance the way he did with China.
Not really a spoiler when it's in the trailer, lol
Good to see you fine & healthy.
As I watch this review and I’m sitting here thinking “watch f-x the family will be in a starship in space, it’ll happen eventually” …. 3 minutes later lol
The next F&F movie title should be for "Fu%k Fhysics." 🤣
The kid was left with Brian they said it in the movie
IGN gives army of the dead a 6 but this garbage a 8...
Am I the only one who kinda enjoyed the movie a bit
I stopped watching after F2 these movies suck
John Cena as a take no prisoners American tough guy is science fiction.
Logic went out the door with hobbs and shaw fighting a superhero.
It's Cena! I knew this was gonna suck when he was pitted as the bad guy.
Doms kid is by another woman. It’s not Letis kid
This Film are dumb And When You Review it Is will Be Lmao 😂😂
This movie is definitely gonna be greater than the previous ones
Fast and Furious being self-aware is them admitting that they are writing garbage. So, not really a good thing to be doing.
I need your t-shirt.  Not the actual one your wearing because that would be weird but a new one of it.
This movie probably makes bollywood directors go like, ahhhhh they are taking inspiration huh.
*spoilers*  Honestly, you really can’t fault them for going to space — it’s only the natural progression of how things escalated. I joked about it along with some others on the internets, but tbh, there was nowhere else to go after parachuting cars out of planes and then “fighting” a sub with a car.
How about a spoof of this series called: Furry-ous
Next one will be FxXx featuring 2 Vin Diesel
The fact that the whole cast agreed to keep doing these dumb movies, just shows why they don't get hired for anything else, or any serious movie worth appreciating.
These movies are trash.
Wow I’m shocked  he gave this a low score after Army of the dead and Conjuring 3  I was gonna assume he would give this an A++ . Well glad to see you have not been bought sir.
I give it a D+ and that's only because of the action scenes
When you were speechless about how unrealistic it is for cars to catch people, and you didn’t want to start explaining the physics, I lost my shit. So funny, thanks for the great video.
I had an incredibly fun time watching this movie and that’s all I could ask for
I had the opposite reaction that, yes the dumb portions that were just as dumb as the four films before it, were clearly demarcated as dumb BUT the brothers backstory was actually a fair bit more serious and tragic than I was expecting. And the plot was more complex than I was expecting too - started teetering towards Mission Impossible plotting.
I think the biggest problem I had with this movie was that characters- in my favourite films in the franchise, each character had some kind of memorable scene or line or something that made them feel like they contributed something and in this movie the only main character I felt mattered was Dom. Even Mia who should have played a bigger role considering the main villain is her brother too
What does suspension of disbelief mean?  “To allow oneself to believe that something is true even though it seems impossible the plot is ridiculous, but if you can suspend (your) disbelief, it can be a enjoyable movie.”  This movie takes suspension of disbelief too far and fails to relate anything to the real world.
I stopped after part 2
One of the worst movies you’ll ever see
So the one without the rock was dog shit
I feel like this is a set up for fast 10 and just hope it will surprise me next time
My weeb friend called this a live action anime, if you just assume all these characters are just superhero car gokus it makes ALOT OF SENSE 😂  This any type of gritty car street vibes, it’s full blown MCU level funny
F9 has officially broke the absurdity meter for Chris. *Hobbs&Shaw* : What, Facebook ceo's in super suits, being apart of a global conspiracy of a shadow government not crazee nuff for ya'?
Where can I find that shirt???!!!! Please help
Vin Diesels best performance was in Saving Private Ryan sadly.
Part 10 better be called Fas(10) your seat belts
F9 10/10 for best comedy
Fast and furious is about gods driving their chariots
I enjoyed it these films are my guilty pleasure I feel like shaw is just the character from the transporter which is awesome because I enjoy them films too 👍
If the last one was called The F8 (Fate) of the Furious, this movie should've been called The Fast are F9 (Fine).
I stopped watching after Tokyo Drift
Remember kids if you are about to get run over by a car just jump on top of it, the impact will be sofetned by the windshield and the power of family
fast and furious 50 it’s never a last ride
Yup when they added John Cena in this was like nope this is going to be COMPLETELY STUPID.  Damn it, why  couldn't they just stay with racing and stealing.  😭
Chris you’ve been my favourite critic for years now and this video confirms you as someone that I genuinely look up to and aspire to be. I left F9 without seeing your review and I couldn’t quite put into words what had I had seen (always enjoyed these films as guilty pleasures and think Fast Five is particularly epic) but after seeing you’re review it is absolutely spot on and I couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s such a shame it’s become a parody of itself. Anyways, You’re the best.
Fast 3 was probably the best one and stopped watching after 6
What if they are all already dead? That’s how they keep going
Fast 10 will definitely be about time travel. The title....................................      FAST TO THE FUTURE
I'm pretty sure the "Fast Universe" is clearly a prequel to Riddick or DeadShot or.... both?
i wish they would get back to the way the first one was post to be .....about street racing and mybe lil trouble that was way more beliveable ......i love most of them but the first one is the best one
I walked out of the theater and thought "they didn't just jump the shark they went over it in a rocket car"
F10 Toreto vs Ultimus Prime
Stop watching shit and shit will no longer be shat.
So with the magnet stuff, guess they need to have a crossover with 6 Underground
Brian was with Brian! They mentioned it in the safe house
Fast 15 "THIS TERMINATOR IS MY FAMILY"
Love the Jurassic Park shirt, I like how you're basically foreshadowing what Universal wants to do next with Fast and Furious.
the worst thing to happen to fast and the furious was ferraris and super cars. What  made it so cool was the petty crime they did and the customized JDM cars
These movies are just empty.
2 fast 2 Furious will still be the coolest one in the franchise.
I hated the movie franchise after the first one
I've been a big fan of the franchise for years but this one was just so disappointing. It's been pretty much a superhero series for ages now and it being really ludicrous has been fine but F9 just seems to get it wrong. Having Roman point out how everything they do is basically impossible and then continue to do it is just daft and what the hell was going on at the start of the movie with him on his own in the gunfight? It's just bizarre. I hadn't realised the writer of most of the previous films wasn't involved and wouldn't have expected it'd make such a difference but it clearly does.
Can we stop supporting this stupid franchise
“The avengers vs the fast family” who wins??
Finally lmao.....saw this last month on an illegal stream...they fkin go to space!!! Lmao unreal
Have they ever asked themselves, “I know we can make more fast movies and people will come to see them, but SHOULD we?”
Mia makes a comment saying that her children and Dom's son Brian are both under the care of Paul Walker's character at home. So it is explained, but I agree with the rest of this review. As a diehard fan of this franchise, this movie was ridiculous in all of the wrong ways. Very disappointing.
F:22 Fast and furious v Mortal Combat
They lost me after 7. I really think Paul walker is what made the movies more grounded and once they lost him then vin just went crazy. I hated the Cuba scene in 8 and I felt they did suck a dis service to the people in Cuba with that fake stupid race that could have just been shot in Miami.
It was good bro trust
It’s a Comedy!!!!!!!!! Well said!!👏🏼👏🏼
Brian was babysitting Brian lol The only way to keep Paul walkers character mentioned.
Chris's face in the thumbnail says it all! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
The entire series is a joke, each one worse than the other :))
I think Brian is babysitting Brian, at least that's what they say at some point
Nice dragon ball tattoo
33👎 actually means the opposite for these elites
The Production quality of Chris Stuckmann's video is the best of all critics out there.
I don’t know about y’all but I need a FF and Jurassic park crossover!!
They didn't just jump the shark, they shot it whilst in mid air, landed & F*CKED its corpse
F0 was laughably bad. The plot what there was of it seemed to be written by a brain damaged 12 year old. I was a fan of the franchise, kind of lost me at 6 if I am honest. The 5th movie will always be the best of the franchise
There was a small scene when Mia turned up and mentioned Byran was looking after the kids.  I felt like a lot of scenes had odd transitions that needed more context but small lines of dialog would fill that in later on.  May have just missed it? But he was safe being looked after and not left in the bunker :p
The film was mid. I was underwhelmed, the F&F franchise has gone so crazy that I was expecting crazier stubds but the stunts and action sequences are like fast 4, fast 5 level of craziness
Fun fact: John Cena was in entire Fast and furious movies but you just couldn’t see him
What lost me about even wanting to watch this movie was after what John Cena did which made me lose all respect for him and shows that he is just another Hollywood sellout who could care less about his own country and only cares about making money just like universal studios because clearly they're the ones that pushed him to bend the knee to China and not recognize that Taiwan is a country and should be treated as such and fuck what the Chinese government thinks!!!!!
Press F9 to *forget* paying respect to the "Family".
I was never a fan of the fast & furious movies
They started out boosting DVDs and ended up as super spy’s saving the world.
Next one needs time travel, horseback and chariot races
Hey Chris! I think the adopted  movie equivalent for “jumping the shark“ is “nuking the fridge” in reference to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
I haven't watched one since Tokyo Drift came out and I have no plans to watch anymore
Do not try to find a logic in a shit. This Santa Barbara shit is like the experiment on humanity for degradation level.
You can only suspend disbelief so far. It sounds like series bloat is setting in, and they're running out of ideas.
Man, I kind of knew F9 was going to be a joke.  Sux to hear that it really is now.  Well, thankfully I can go watch it tonight in the theaters knowing to take it as a comedy/parody and not like a car enthusiasts film like the 1st few Fast and Furiouses were 😐
So when they gonna start racing again?
FX: The real Space adventure
Bruh you are funny af when you imitate Don as a mindless Ape :D
Jump the orbit. I see a new term for movies 🎥 being born 😆
Cypher doesn't enlist Jacob at all. Jacob captures her and then uses her to find the Ares. Don't know which version is out in USA tho
The 5 years old children made this movie.... Just terrible.... Nothing makes Sense!!!!
Oh please, don't give them ideas about that baby incident! At this point I don't think they'd mind makeing a spin off "slow n furious'..a home alone ripoff!
I think my girlfriend is super duper hyped for it thinking it’s gonna be like the others and I’m so excited to see her face when it all goes to complete cartoon shit, I’m gonna enjoy this….very, very much
To hazard a guess I think F-9 is the antidote to C-19.  I need fantastic silliness in my life right now.
The Chinese ripoff version will probably be more insane an do it purposefully
I guess Hollywood is copying Bollywood action 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Next movie will be called Fast10 your seatbelts 😂
I never got the hype behind these movies! They are just flat out stupid to me.
One last ride (?)
Death of a salesman
next fast and furious 10 on the moon
I haven't seen any of these movies. I have no desire to right that wrong.
After Tokyo Drift I gave up on this franchise… so yeah, not interested, but your reviews are enjoyable 😅
This a superhero movie with powers of Family and invulerabilty lol
Chris : " I think I am lost in that one" Me: first time , chris?
Its all about family who are the most distant inconsiderate Parents ever
Hey Chris not sure if you will see this comment but I have DMed you on IG regarding a film review. Hope you get a chance to check.
Meanwhile Army of the dead gets ripped for plot holes and unbelievable situations while this garbage gets praised by most reviewers
Teetering into parody? What movies have you been watching? These movies have been full on pardy, live action cartoons for several years lol.
This franchise has ruined the internet alias I've used since I saw The Matrix in '99
F9 has everything except for actual plot
In the next one they need to go so fast and so furious that they go back in time!
Kicking a torpedo in the last movie didn’t lose you? Lol
Fast series is becoming the live Saturday cartoon.
Technically FU should come before FX. 😆🙄
Sounds like this is Superfast II. I recommend the original parody lol
I want see the movie 🍿
If they make FX they need to f*ing redeem themselves and make a good movie.  I would give this movie a D Because its not a comedy it was supposed to be a action movie
The Fast and furious family is now really marvel superheroes. Vin diesel is captain America 😂
I’m a huge fast and furious fan. I never walked out of the cinema after watching a fast and furious movie disappointed  Until F9 🤦🏽‍♂️.  Massive drop off from number 8 The story was boring and weak
Jumping a car from building to building. Yeah. Cartoon. lol. Each movie is silly.
Nuking the 'fridge?
F9 with the picture of the key from a computer keyboard has me dying!!!!
Love this review.
Just looking for some dumb summer fun w fast cars, pretty girls and testosterone ladden men!!! 🤣🤣🤣
This movies are just a meme to the point it stopped being enjoyable for me at least.
Fast and furious franchise is challenging the all indian action movies. Actually it just like any Indian action movies which just hate Newton laws and always ready to break it becoz it's cool 😎😎😎
I’m only watching fast-ten your seat belt because of the title if not I refuse.
No!
Im waiting for Transformers crossover.😄
Well, the last one wasn't comedy enough. So I might have the best time ever with this one ?😆
They're unofficial Matrix sequels.
these films have gone to complete shit...     they went from car races to Avengers - Ludicrous Speed...
This is borderline RED and RED 2 movies but in much much more ridiculous plots and stunts !! Hahahaha
Chris looks like he's having so much fun reviewing this movie
I'll save you the hassle.  John Cena becomes part of the "Fast family" at the end and will be a hero tp help take on Han's super secret evil twin brother in the next movie, who will then become good and fight with them in F11: Exit Full Screen.    I think by then Disney should buy the franchise and make them all officially Avengers.
Cars can catch you if they consider you family.
sounds  like a real shitty movie xD cant wait to see it <3
You dont see f9 for logic and plot.  You see f9 to see a bald man live life a quarter mile at a time   And talk so slow and not at quarter mile at a time
It’s not Dom’s and lettys son
I am waiting for the day that fast and furious lost it and start to be a comic book movie
That bank vault scene wasn’t CGI. They really did it. When they were done filming that scene, multiple people had broken bones. Looks ridiculous and fake, but they really did it.
Fast11 ....it'll be half footage of Vin Deisel close up, the other half from Forza Horizon 5 in Mexico!
They jumped the shark when they went into space.....
fast and furious started and died on 2001 with the first one
Family Family Family Family Family Family Family Family Family  I'm going to abandon my child to fight my brother who I never told anyone existed    Edit. Also Fast 5 is not only the best one it's the only good one... And I fucking hate what they did with The Prodigy Breathe
They should've stopped after the Fast 7 movie. That Paul Walker tribute was the best way to end the franchise.
It makes almost no sense that they have made 9 of theses movies. This is nothing more than hot wheels and arm butter at this point. Do these movies even need a story at this point?
I went and watched it the other day and after Fast 8 (which I absolutely despised) I had very low expectations and expected already by the trailer that this was gonna be “mission freaking insanity”, again. So I just decided to act like it was a comedy/parody. And I genuinely laughed so many times throughout the film. I honestly really enjoyed it. So please do this yourself. Anyways, a couple of my friends and I just watched all 8 films over the last 2 days. I want to say that I just miss the charm. The realism. Fast 2 was great because it was a fun film.Paul and tyrese don’t take themselves too serious, and the stunts and storyline were plausible. Vin diesel takes himself soo seriously in the series, like he has no idea how to have fun anymore. As a car enthusiast myself, I especially loved the first 3 movies for the jdm/tuner cars and scene, so I liked seeing Han return, along with the flashback of a street race and also the end scene with the r34.  Anyways I’ll end this comment here. Peace
FX they going to bring Paul Walker back!!! Watch what I tell you!
The strange thing is that Elon Musk ALREADY put a car into space. Strange days.
Everything that you said I already figured lol  It started when vin caught a 4000 lb engine with one hand Lmaoo
The fast franchises has destroyed all movies stories. Now we can not be sure if any character dies in the movie further. Maybe, Vince is also alive and will come back.
Has there ever been a good movie that had flashbacks in it?
How come no one is talking about the fact that the movie starts with explaining Dom's dad dying, where as in the first movie gave a different explanation for the death.
« Look I have the Tire Collection « , I am waiting for the installment that go on the moon… so a bad movie is still a bad movie. The cars look nice, the gals look nice, and Van Diesel… I miss Paul Walker… RIP… I miss Gal Gadot…
Nihao Xina
After 7 it was just getting ridiculous.  It's not even about cars No more. I would say that's good Rock left because he's to good for these movies. But hobs & shaw had a bunch of ridiculous special effects  scenes to. They need to go back to making it about cars and ease up on the crazy action shit.
F10: Cars drive you
It is ridiculous and Tyrese’s character even said how ridiculous it is that nothing ever happens to them, 😂
You have to understand the fast franchise is actually an anime. Everyone has a special power (in this case a car), and in the end, its all about family and friendship
Five? The one where they invented passenger trains and cânions in Brazil?
Fast and the furious meeks Jurassic world! Come on  universal!!
How many times are they gonna do the whole brother thing.
For me the most favourite one is fast and furious 4 where paul walker had the blue skyline. Because this franchise seems more realistic compared to the other franchise.
Can you please change your intro music.  It's so bloody irritating.  I feel like ripping my ears out everytime I hear it.  It's 2021.  Please change it.
Finally we r seeing u
The best movie is fast 5 .
Chris is the only movie reviewer I care to watch anymore. He knows movies, knows what a good movie in a particular genre should look like and knows what they shouldn't. He explains it all in a passionate way that most everyone can grasp.
They left kid Brian with Brian (Paul Walker's character). Mia tells Dom that both their children are in safest hands.
once look salman khan's movie  you will know what's physics 😉
You have the an tire collection, good for you :)
I never laughed so hard. They actually went to space.
They aren't superheroes, they're FAMILY
Had no interest in seeing this. Tunned out after Tokyo drift. They should really stop.
I am Indiana
Right, no broken bones, nothing.🤣
F9, sounds kinda extra af. The best movies in the franchise to me were 1, 4, 5, and 6. 2 and 3 were ok, but kinda felt awkward 7 and 8 were meh, and not on par with rest franchise, but mildly entertaining.
I'm not a big fan of this franchise, but Fast Five had some magic to it.  And that vault chase!
Lmao F9 key🤣
Let's be honest, F1, F2 and F3 Tokyo Drift, were the best movies. Everything after is just trash.
they said that paul walker brian is taking care of all the kids
Brian was at Brians (Paul Walker's character) they did say that at some point.
Fast 10 Furious : Dom wakes up from a coma that he got from the crashing bus at the end of Fast and Furious 4
Is this just The Shark now?
F&F is coded socialist revolutionary filmmaking. You know it's on when they basically steal the bank.
Great...now the confused pansexual is wearing a alphabet people wrist band.  He'll be wearing a Tutu next!!
The films are good at toeing the line of realism, just before parody? Is this the film series where the main character has a sword fight using bits of car wreckage and then explains the problem with street fights is the streets always win, before stamping on the floor to make it collapse?
Worst film I've ever seen
None of Fast 6 made sense, not from the opening chase scene where they shot the cars with mini computers (rather than bullets), to the scene where Brian goes to prison to the 10 mile runway.
So you are saying that F9 is NOT a movie about *murmurs *  family
im'a be honest i dont care about the story and shit in this series anymore, their just goofy movies that you watch for fun and there is no problem with that imo.
they lost me after Tokyo drift....
Next movie Fast 10 your seat belts
I don't Care!! As longs this movie has no identity politics, diversity hire, nor feminists messages I WILL ENJOY IT!!
Heard China was going to allow an English version of this movie to be released in the USA.
The fact these kind of movies still making millions of dollars, marks the official death of The art of cinema.
nothing can beat The Rock vs The Dies! concrete was literally disintegrating under their feet as they were fighting! you can't beat that even if you are John Cena.
FX.... Gisele is alive and working with cypher.
Keeping it real has never been the formula for this series. It gets more and more stupid.
These are still being made, because people keep watching them😂😭
The FAST and the Furious should just DIE. It should've died ages ago since they're just rehashing the same plot with a slight twist here and there, over and over again. They are just milking this film series to death since like, FOREVER and what's bad about it is people keep buying into it, so in some case we should be blamed too. Now with that said, what about that cliffhanger ending, huh. If you think Han coming back from the dead is insane... *spoilers*   They're most likely bringing *Brian O'Conner* back for FX or Fast 10 or F10 or More Faster, More Furiouser 10 or Fatso Meets Furiosa or whatever the fuck they will stupidly call it
Laws of physics don't apply if you're a family
The first movie is the best one what are you talking about?
Can't wait for the Fast and Furious Home Alone crossover movie
They said in the movie that doms kid was with Brian looking after his and doms kid
I thought the movie mentioned that Dom left his kid in Brian O'Conner's care (since he is still alive in the franchise's universe).
Jumped the shark is now left the planet
I've never watched one of these trashed flops. It's like WWE. Stupid. Plots from  a 7 year old playing with hot wheels
I think you're being too nice. All of those films are laughable, not just the latest one. Except maybe the first film
Is it called the en-tyre collection? That looked like it was shot in Glasgow?
Korey from Double Toasted predicted they would go to space too☺️.
Its just a S**t Cartoon
I get to see it Saturday I can’t wait 😛
i havnt seen it yet..but isnt a "cartoon" normal now?? for this?? dialog>> lol..lol??? believe anything?? i mean...this isnt new to this franchise...what are we expecting here...I think you may be to critcical to a bat shit crazy ride..
Shifting gears in space was a nice touch
John C will not be in F10 , F11,  F12  he lost face to China who the franchise is a money ho for. Lost his balls so no one in the west wants to see him , well he had a short run.
Meet the G.I Joe's everybody
F9 is basically just an anime at this point
I think the f9 series are having like a "powercreep" situation, a game term where characters keep getting stronger every update making the game unbalaced. They probably think every next movie needs to be more absurd than the last or people will have nothing to look forward to in the movie, but the problem is they make the next movie with the maximum insanity they can, that the next movies need to be more insane even though it transcends reality. I won't be surprised if the next Fast movies casts the Avengers revealing we were in the Marvel Universe all along.
"FX" - perfect
F9 in space
Chris, that's complete BS, this is nothing new! The "Fast" franchise has been sailing face first into retarded stupidity since the 6th one (you can feel free to go back some, if you want), whilst getting steadily much worse. I checked out long ago due to this, as did so many. Now we got F9 and if the trailers weren't a clue as to what you were gonna get, nothing would have been. Dumb, ridiculous waste of time. What have these films (if you even wanna call them that) turned into?
Do u like this better than the rock and jason stathum’s hobbs and shaw?
What I saw during this review was enough for me. I can't even watch this film as a comedy, because even as a comedy it's a bad movie.
I understand people still keep watching these movies and it's made billions but after 3rd movie I've started losing interest in them the action scenes are also getting worse each movie and there just to impossible to happen 😂 there becoming car racing comedy's like Ricky bobby taledaga nights 😂 if you have seen the fast and furious parody movie it's literally just like how these movies are becoming imo 😂 let me guess next movie vin and John find out there dad is still alive and they have to rescue him 😂
I love how Chris can't stop himself from laughing his ass off 🤣
Please review invincible chris!!!
Cmon man, this is just live action adaptation from an anime we never knew
So when is Vin Diesel gonna fight Thanos?
FAMILY
4:29
God it just keeps on going....
I haven't even watched your review but your face in the thumbnail says it all! 😆
This is the parody of the FF.
Please comment on where u get ur tshirts. I need this one. thanks
My favorite one was the first one. It was grounded, believable and it had a good story.
Didn't even know this movie came out.
Issa bou famULY…
All the movies after Fast 6 are just tedious and low key dumb.  Yes people bash 6, but you can't deny the sense of fun. Its got totally ludicrous (Ludacris) moments such as the longest airport in the world, Dom's Superman flying. But some of the set pieces are just so much fun and top class entertainment. The F1 style car chase through London, the tank on the motorway. Great supporting cast too
I don't automatically hate CGI but I also have an endearing respect for practical stunts, especially in high octane adrenaline fueled thrill rides. Fast and Furious movies just make no attempt to hide that half of this stuff is on a soundstage, although someone will point out that there are a lot of practical stunts going on. I do enjoy them for being absolutely retarded, but give me The Road Warrior any day over this franchise. That being said I might have caught this one in the theaters but John Cena has made my shit list, so I'll be waiting to grab this one off the high seas. I wanna support theaters, but Hollywood doesn't make it easy.
Love this Shirt!
Well they had to appease the Chinese overloads
If you're a car person, parody was crossed way back by the first FF movie, at least that's how me and my buddies felt back in the day.   BTW, sounds like the franchise has reached the point where the next one will be called F This.  F You for the one that follows that.
I don't wanna see it I hate they brought back Hon , so the whole death of Hon story line in fast 3, fast 6 fast 7 don't even matter now . This is fuckn retarded
Fk 9
TAIWAN
About who was babysitting Brian, they actually explained it. Brian (Mia's husband) was babysitting Brian, along with his own kids.
F10 fast In space
love that JP tee chris, where did you get it?
Fast X Furious
F15: The team goes through the speed force
It feels like sci fi. Cause gravity and physics, dont come into play, in this universe. Less believable than a bond film. And no matter what, you know they will prevail, so there is no tension or build up. Dumb action films, for the times Michael Bay is on holiday.
Schrodinger's Brian…
I’ve left logic at the door since the first fast and furious movie. And I still enjoy it.
Leave your logic at the door movie. The movie even makes fun of themselves for the ridiculous within the movie and during press.
This used to be a series about cars.
I can’t wait for the reboot… with Vin Diesel
I quit them at 7 lol
The original Fast and the Furious is fucking badass... even if it was a rip off
This was hilarious
In the Movie, Young Brian is being taken care of by Brain O’Connor while Mia is out doing the stuff with his kids aswell
I want a fast & furious x jurrasic world crossover
The keyboard key. Shee-it.
Instead of ending on a good note with proper conclusion in fast 7 they opt to go for money grabbing mindless action movie instead which make tons of money but totally ruined the legacy of it
Chris,  Can you please do a full movie analysis of Requiem For A Dream?  I would love to hear your thoughts on this movie.
The kid fed itself
Tokyo drift is still worth a watch.
John Cena was a bad choice.
before watching the review. Im here to support Chris and his content. Im watching it no matter what he says because its a dumb action movie. I know it  will throw logic out the window
So clearly the next step of escalation for this series will be Time Travel for F-10, followed by the discovery of the FF Multiverse (The space between parking spaces) in F11 where they can quietly recast these middle aged has-beens for new models until those characters ultimately achieve awareness that they're fictional characters in a movie and that can finally lead into a proper Last Action Hero sequel with a 90 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger taking them all out
F and f cinematic universe.
To think this all started with a tuna sandwich.
100% a cartoon.pretty much :)
Why would anyone leave a thumbs down?
Next one will have clones. After that, Time machines. Here's hoping we get Mechas soon.
When will it end🥱🥱🥱
Next part would the family being recruited by Nick Fury. It's not that farfetched
Vin Diesel's agent must have dirt on EVERYONE in Hollywood....how is he still allowed to "act"?
♨♨♨♨🗑🗑🗑
Shrodinger's Brian
I wanna see it because of the Fiero.
this movie is pure cringe
Can't wait to see a crossover with them and the Power Rangers.    "It's family time".
They've orbited the shark
F10 will be i think the cars will break the speed of light and travels faster than it. Family can do that. 😂😂😂
Brian was babysitting the kids lmao and how about a car driving into space 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
nobody cares about the adventures of potato head and his fameleh anymore. The rock was the best thing to happen to this franchise. Thats not saying much but i think it says a lot.
At this point, the franchise seems like it's power rangers with cars
FAMBILY
They lost me after Tokyo Drift
Can't wait for Fast & The Furious 10 the last installment supposedly. The gang will head to the moon & Elon Musk is the antagonist
So this dude just reviews mainstream movies now even when he knows they’re going to be bad? Ok.
The warlike fortnight naturally plug because hair emphatically help behind a phobic scraper. chivalrous, parsimonious jeans
This movie is for kids. They will love it. Truely a movie to watch with ur kids. Next movie is 'Bryan gets kidnapped and the rescue is on'
They've always been a parody. C'mon!!
Chris you think this review is enough to destroy the film, they have family
F10 is going to be the Prequel to Star Wars 🌟
They lost you at F9😂
as soon as i saw that idiot Cena bow before China i was out this franchise is dead
I was expecting Chris to punctuate with '...in space' right there at 1:22 lol
The high-pitched fly unexpectedly harm because node congruently breathe throughout a exciting exclusive graphic. truculent, material purpose
Man F .....9 im so tired of turning my mine off to watch it 😒
after watching this review, all i want to do is watch F5.
they going to space before the saga gets wrapped up.
Fast & Furious to me is the First movie and the third ( TOKIO DRIFT), I saw all the movies but, ,the 2,4,5,6,7,8.Hobbs & Shaw, I've seen them one, F&F is more like  (THE  A-TEAM)  ENTERTAINING BUT NO SENCE
This is the worst one ,neither emotions nor physics
I felt like this about every fast movie since rock came into the franchise..I don't quite understand why all of a sudden people are  waking up..
Did they find the devil’s bum hole?
they are taking inspiration from  Baaghi 3
They kept realism? I don't know what you're talking about, Chris. Maybe you don't remember the submarine, or that thing that made superhuman, how they jumped from two buildings. Even the fifth movie was unreal as fuck.
Take a deep breath huuh, look at it again. "Oh it's a Piece-of-Shit!" Exactly, that's all it is. Satan squatted, let out a loaf, they put a fucking title on it, put it on a marquee, Satan's shit, piece of shit, walk away. "But is it too, what about the lesbian connot.. ddddd." You're, you're getting really baffled here. Piece-of-Shit! Now walk away.
I forget which one it was...but I was out..once the Rock...flexed his broke arm and broke free from his cast. LOL...I  was like..YEAHHHHHHH...that's gonna happen. Fast and Furious was the best sequel...in my opinion. The Chevelle alone...earns more stars from me.
Correct me if I’m wrong but I think landing on dirt is preferable to landing on a fucking car
The F&F movies went full-on absurdity mode the moment those Chargers started pulling that bank vaul way back when, everything since then is pretty much the same. I haven't watched this one yet, but from what I hear the absurdity is not why it's not as good as the previous however many sequels. Me, I like the first few, when they at least pretended there's something resembling realism in them. Plus Tokyo Drift, because it has one of the rare cases where the protagonist isn't immediately better than everyone else but is actually pretty bad and has to learn.
Furious 7 had 2 cars driving into each other head-on...TWICE
Of course they jump the shark biiiiiigggggg time!
Im actually surprised this franchise has a writer.. I imagine ryan George pitch meeting writer...
They SUPER JUMP THE SHARK
FS9 DOES not need logic any more at this point
Fast franchise is real life anime
Shaking my head bud. All your latest comment is always criticizing other people’s work. Covid has been tough and people are looking to films to get back to the norm and have something net new to watch.  Enjoyed your content for a while but getting tired of all the criticism, no longer subscribing ✌️
0:04 God damn it Chris! XD
Brian is actually Elena and Dom's son, right?
F10: Villain: Dom's Father F11: Dom's Mother F12: Dom's Son F13: Dom's Doctor
The very fast and furious road runner  beep beep.
What a weird review. No one ever said Fast and Furious was supposed to be realistic. Why would it be realistic? They have gradually graduated each film to basically a cinematic universe of human hero characters. The whole point of the entire thing is the lifetime of this FAMILY. Why does it have to be realistic lmao. Why can't they go to space and be superheroes. Who cares. Its about FAMILY. All we ever wanted from Fast and Furious is hot whips, dope fist fights, classic tough guy monolgues by Vin Deisal holding a Corona, and wild action scenes that live up to the Dom Toretto mythos. It's supposed to be absurdity. It's the definition of it in fact.
F1,F2,F3,FU :)
F11: The Transformers, GI Joe, Frodo Baggins and Katniss Everdeen team up with the Toretto family to put a stop to Voldemort and Dark Vader in an epic space race to reverse time so the whole franchise resets itself. Reboot time!
there was a quick line of dialogue in the movie that Brian was watching the 2 kids. LOL. RIP
I calling it now the next one is gonna be in space
They started off stealing DVD players, now they're in space 😔 Jesus fuck.
Why Charlize Theron?   This is a easy pass. I know what age groups will pay to see this. Lol
Fast and Five is the American version of Tamil Indian action movies defying physics and absolute absurdity.
I was over this franchise in fast 5 and mabe before that. When the Rock got added I said, alright, no more.  I like the Rock only not in all movies.
This is what jumping the 🦈 looks like.
I personally hate it when products or companies becomes self conscious. Sometimes it becomes cringey.
It has to be said. These movies are for morons.
Next one needs to be in space with a race on Mars.
They should just..... STOP. 😂♥️🇵🇭
F nine was fine Missed opportunity
next movie is called Fast 10, as in fasten your seat belts, we going to Mars.
They go to 'space'? HAHAHA
One thing about these movies is that Tyrese is absolutely useless and does nothing in these movies. He was this tough guy badass in part 2 and now he's nothing but the butt of all the jokes and the "screaming guy" in the big chase scene so they can make fun of him some more. His character does literally nothing but scream and say "ha-haaaaa" every once in a while. Oh and he also gets to look confused at some point in every movie.
I can’t like these movies because they are just so ridiculously stupid. I love watching “so bad they’re good” movies but these are just way too ridiculous to even watch them that way.
Fast&Furious has officially become Marvel
I just want to see Sung Kang that’s it
This film is good as long as u have family
Well it sounds like F9 is an F9 Which is like a failing grade in my country
I think that the best part of this film is the expression that you made for the preview image, was really priceless.
I don't care that they are basically superheroes now; I'm glad they've embraced the ridiculousness. I hope there's time travel in the next one.
I think tyrese dies and comes back as a transformer f12
I like watching other people talk about how dumb these movies are cause I sure as hell am never wasting my time on any of them. When one of your main characters is Vin Diesel you know it's gotta be terrible.
I can’t believe that so many people are still watching these and allowing them to keep making movies 😂
Cheap and lazy writing loaded with B actors for an easy paycheck is what this is. Target audience 10 years old.
They'll be in the avengers next
I like the part where they publicly apologize for implying Taiwan is a real country 🙄
Turn your brain off for two hours and have some fun. Worked on the first eight.
Can they make an Alt F4 and just fucking quit 😏
*you just didnt get it -_-* it is about family.
These movies lost me at the fourth one.
*cars go brum*
I'm waiting for the Transformers cross over
movie deserve F-.
I love ya Chris but please for children's sake try to temper your swearing so we can watch you and enjoy your otherwise great reviews. Cheer's love your work!
I think Dom and Letty's kids are actually gonna be Spy kids. It's all adding up now
Next movie will be called "Fast10 your seatbelts"
So jumping from a plane while in their cars was tame compared to this. IM IN!!!
I pretty much Laughed During the Movie
I laughed harder than I should have at that f9 key pic
So in other words the film is shit like all of the other films?
“Never turn your back on family, until you do, and that even includes the family you never acknowledge or even knew existed!” Dom torreto
I’m very unlikely to watch this film, I just knew Chris’ review would be absolutely hilarious 😂
Taiwan is a country.
Shit is garbage wouldn’t watch it if you paid me
in ff10, they will do time travel. they'll face the expendables at first, and later become allies against the main threat, evil nicolas cage
always remember this entire franchise, started out as a gang that was tying to steal dvd players.
Gal Gadot must return to the Family to  reveal that she was Wonder Woman the whole time. They can ride all the cars on her lasso straight to the heavens.  Ok Hollywood.. do it!!
Fast Five and Hobson Shaw are probably my favorites
2 fast 2 furious will always be one of my “getaway” movies. Upping the ante  will always be the summer blockbuster popcorn meta. Sugary exaggeration fantasy.  The fast franchise had people putting cherry bomb mufflers and neon lights underneath whatever car’s they had or had peoples parents investing in vehicles they ultimately wound up crashing or trading for a mini van.  The first movie had a very serious take to draw interest then they knew they could get creative once it became a part of pop culture. They really finessed the franchise after Tokyo drift which felt like a knee jerking reset….come full circle they knew they had to go back and explore the popular past characters,events and ideas. Great review btw. I just know that when it’s my time to see this flick it’s gonna be a romp just to get away from life’s burdens…..fantasy is a fun theoretical model.
You know your franchise has been around too long when it's name goes from "The Fast and the Furious" to "Fast" to "F".
Chris's face / thumbnail has me dead
How was the Jurassic park trailer?
"They called it a key stroke - F9" 🤣🤣🤣
My wife will babysit my brain while I watch this with my friends.
Uh oh. That thumbnail's not looking too good.
So in the next one they get hired by some crazy clown lady to steal The Batmobile so she can sell it to save her movie franchise, but Batman kicks the shit out of them & they realise they need to do a Time Heist for some reason, so after some bull shit involving Eddie Hall for some reason they find the location of The Flux Capacitor & they have to steal Hubert Farnsworth's Delorean, after a grueling fight with Bender & Dr Zoidberg Dom gets killed by being pushed into some Amber but Ghost-Rider shows up & lends Hobbs his Bike so he can quickly take Doms body to Jurassic Park because they know shit about dinosaurs being trapped in Amber, I don't want to ruin it but basically the Which King of Angmar turns up on his Fellbeast & The reanimated Dom sees the Fellbeast & says ”thats my new ride"
If You were to ignore the diversion from logic and common sense, it is quite entertaining. The most stupid excuse just to mention Brian is something i can`t get over with though......Little Brian was with big Brian. Dom mentions it when he talks to Letty at one point
Talking about jumping the shark. They lost me the moment they jumped the sub. I have had zero desire to watched any more since then. I can’t even remember which one in the series that was.
So this is now mcu huh?
“Places people have suggested they might go” They went to space didn’t they?
The moment two cars made an armored vehicle do a breakdance move with only magnets I was done 😏🤣🤣🤣🤣
The next movie will be called Fast Ten your Seat Belts 💺End Game
Wow c-. That's pretty high
brian is with uncle brian. It was explained in the movie!
My only f&f experience is watching parts of Tokyo Drift in separate occasions but never watching the full thing… am I missing much?
They lost me after 5
Nah 3 is the best
Watch FX have flying cars
Honestly as someone who’s favorite movie in this franchise is Hobbs and Shaw hearing that it’s super absurd actually makes me really excited
Can the Fast franchise slow down please.
these movies always do impossible things 😭
Little Brian was with big Brian it was in a throw away line when Mia turned up
Dom torettos and the Avengers
They mentioned in the film that their child Brian was with older Brian.
John Cena is a terrible actor.  And these movies got way too far fetched it's laughable.
I’m waiting for Tokyo drift 2!!
Me and my brother always go watch these to laugh we dont care about the movie we just go for a laugh
Udder garbage since FF6.
So get really high before going to see it. Got it
When the creators listen to the fans
I’m fast not to watch this and furious cause they keep making this trash
dude this is a just like fast 7 and i think the movie is good this time u wrong chris
The next one needs to be called Fast 10 Your Seatbelts.
At this point Idc. I stopped caring after Letty died in 4. I just want dumb drunk fun. Cant wait 2 see it.
The only reason I'm happy about this is it means Vin is one more paycheck closer to the next Riddick movie.
Surprised Chris like 6 better than 7, I thought the last action scene in 6 (with the plane on the runway) was dull and way too long.
Me: What is cars capable of on F10? Professor Hulk: Time travel!
They lost me after 5.
Cars can catch people and protect them from submarine explosions in the Fast Universe because car bodies are built out of a combination alloy of memory foam and vibranium.
I'm gonna watch this movie with MY FAMILY
It have a video saying Fast and Furious is a cartoon anime where the characters are superheroes someone have a YouTube video saying that
you missed your chance of giving f9 an f9 🤧😂
Yeah after I heard they’re in space that was enough for me not to see it
I watch this last month it was a letdown no as good as rest ,a lot of it was not fun at all
Why do you insist on reviewing these new garbage movies? Content has really been lackluster later.
I have never seen any of the Fast and the furious movies or Pirates of the Caribbean movies, I'm proud to say 😊😊😊
The Franchise lost me after part 4. They went from street racers to ALL being 007 Agents...now they plan to combine Fast Furious w/Jurassic Park?? Puhlease...
I’ll be honest…I haven’t watched any of this franchise since Paul Walker passed away. It just seems to get more and more ridiculous with each sequel. My favorite is and will always be the original. It’s got major nostalgia points for me, as I was just graduating high school when it came out. I’m sure nostalgia has a lot to do with what movies you truly love and those you just don’t care for, as much.
really want that shirt lmao
The 5th film is actually one of my least favorite. Too stupid. I like 6-8 best, closely followed by 2 and 3! 1, 4 and 5 are the worst. Haven't seen 9 just yet, but may do so tomorrow.
Brian is babysitting Brian! Paul Walker's character is still alive in the movie universe.
So you say that the movie about beings chasing each other really fast and furiously finally became Road Runner?
Like all film buffs, Chris says a made up big word to sound smart. Hilariocity is an example of this
C- , woooow you're generous......
I only watch the Fast and Furious movies for their emotional power. So needless to say I have been disappointed for 8 films straight. Lol jk Cars and butts is why people go to see these
There was a super enhanced humans in Hobbs and Shaw. Just saying.
I love that The Fast and Furious films embrace absurdity. I'm so excited to see this film. Can't wait to see it in IMAX.
They should fight the Avengers in the next one
I literally gave up on this movie with Jody from baby boys fake out death. In a weird way this is slap stick cringe and funny this is a cartoon. Now they are spies with cars that do stuff to loud.
I can’t wait for Fast 10 where the family survive nuclear fallout by outracing the explosion.
The Fast and Furious series has been an all encompassing superhero universe this entire time! Light-years ahead of Marvel and DC. You watch and see when M. Night Shyamalan directs "F-X" and hits everyone with the twist LOL.
F9, That movie jumped the shark, then with a chain wrapped around the shark continue to drag it upwards into insanity.  Fun BatS**T insanity!!!
"One last ride"
Im sorry Chris the best one is the original The Fast and the Furious from 2001. That movie has soul!!
Fast ten, your seatbelts
To answer your question at 2:29 they said that the late Paul Walker's character Brian was watching Brian along with his own son Jack and their second born.
I’m over Fast n Furious movies.  I like when they were more realistic.
lol this is one of your funnier reviews, Chris - hilarious "I think they actually lost me on this one" lolol. You invented my new favorite word too "hilariosity"  Great advice too - "go into like you are seeing a comedy - done and done!
They really jumped the shark with this it seems. But whatever. At the 9th installment it doesn't really matter anymore. They really should just do that Jurrasic World crossover for the 10th. Fast cars vs Dinosaurs!
After Paul walker's passing. The franchise went to shit
The facial expression on the thumbnail nails it
Is Tego Calderón and Don Omar in this movie?
Next one better have aliens
FX? Don't you mean Fast & Fur10us
F11: the cars were robots all along.
I would love a hilariocity of Tiptoes.
Chris, the 10th movie MUST be called Fas10 your Seatbelt
You’re waking up about 4 movies too late. These moves are friggin terrible.
I genuinely stopped taking this franchise seriously when The Rock diverted a freaking torpedo with his bare hands.
The furious vs godzilla
Its time for that one last ride. Again. But for family. Again...
I mean where do they go after this? I feel like once they’ve done all of the crazy stunts it’ll cut years later and the new generation of the “family” is sort of grown up but instead of crazy nonsense they’ll just race and stuff. The most crazy thing being like stealing cars or thwarting a dudes drug deal. That or they all die and don has to race death to get them back
No matter how much you hate this franchise (I hate it too), somehow many people still watch it and it still makes into Box Office.
It’s a straight F - !!!!!!
Once you enter the Family, you become immortal
FX needs to have Car Space Battles
F&f franchise are becoming cringy af!💯😆😂🤣
Giving this movie C- is probably generous
Do you ever wonder if the intent with these movies is to just make them more and more absurd to see how far they have to go before the masses won't actually watch them?  It's like it's a giant sociological experiment to see how many people can be entertained by complete nonsense.
After watching Chris's reviews for over a year... I never would have imagined him saying "Im a fan of these movies..."  LOL
I can’t wait for “Fast10 your seatbelts”.
We are family now
Super excited for Fast 10: Your Seatbelts
So you have the "In Tire" (Entire) collection?
F10: the team go to black hole to stop thanos
Watch Dark you one llittle movie fan.
First time I've noticed your bracelet, awesome!
So, Brian Sr. (Paul Walker) was babysitting. Mia mentioned it at one point. But yeah, the movie didn't grab me.
It’s a fucking action movie just like the mission impossible series Why are people so critique this movie & franchise When I go so a f& f movie I want to be entertained  with the action the scenery the hot chicks the music & for me f& f delivers
The Fast and Furious series is just funny. They lost any realism so many movies ago.
Fast and furious ended at 7
Hats off to all the fans, you can do something that I cannot: Enjoy a movie that defies every physics that we know of.  For me it is the worst franchise in the history of franchise. The first movie was kinda good, it goes very downhill from there. But this is my taste, you guys enjoy what you want to enjoy :)
Movies like this are just for entertainment you fool..  M from India.. and our whole country is talking about this movie.. nd we are loving it..  Who the fuck you are!!  "Nd oh C minus!! Thats for you when you came out of your mama's womb"
Whenever you laugh talking about any scene of he movie.. i dont knw why but something deep inside me makes me wanna slap you so bad!!  I hate when you laugh
What else could it be called besides FX? How about Fast10 Your Seatbelts
Yes definitely agree
C- is very generous
Chris it’s anime it’s American anime deal with it lol
Dom always talking about family, but never tells everyone about his “brother”
I cracked up in cinema every time they played the F9 trailer, it is a fucking joke at this point. CG Diesel all day, baby.  Also, love the long lost brother 9 movies in that hasn't been mentioned or even hinted at once.
How did we go from stealing DVD players and street racing to rocket cars in space and now they went from being street thugs to super spies. Tokyo drift was the last one that I enjoyed.
Han is back so they can sell this to China, just look at box office there. I think you know this.
It took you out the movie because your taking it too seriously I stopped when Letti came back and the rock and diesel fighting threw walls it’s just a popcorn movie turn your brain off and enjoy it
So this is fantasy?  I understand why people would be interested in these kinds of movies, look at the last John Wick movie, but when is enough, enough? I'm getting bored with these kinds of movie.
I was hoping for a hilariousity. So close
They took F9 to a whole different level a ridiculous level 😅 the worst movie of the whole franchise 👎
I think I have seen most of these movies, and honestly, I can't tell you a single thing about any of them. I just tend to forget them a day or two after I see them.
Chris you are wrong. The next movie should not be F-X. It should    FasTen Your Belts.
I'm waiting for them to turn into Voltron, the vehicle one obviously.
Let’s face it, it became a cartoon a while ago. That’s okay.
How long are they gonna drag this franchise on😑. But for anyone who gets enjoyment outta these movies, go ahead. We certainly need some respite.
Chris, you should review “Gnaw/Apartment 212” on Amazon Prime. I’m curious what you think of it. Love the vids, hope you see this
I liked part 5, 1, 7 and 3 the best.
Not FX... If the next movie isn't called 'Fast10 Your Seatbelts'... its a CRYING SHAME!!!
Remember when this was about racing cars?
The movie sucks but I'm still gonna watch it 😁
F11: Young Brian takes revenge on the family for abandoning him during F9.
Tokyo drift it's the best one in my opinion
F9 is a failing grade here in Nigeria. Rather apt.
Me and my family just started watching fast and the furious, we’ve gotten hooked on it. Yes it’s so ridiculous but it’s fun. Still seeing this in the movies
I think film didn't stand cuz John cena is missing his spine from a few days
fast and furious is boring
From the first movie to the third movie, it was all about the street racing. And the story was grounded. Then the story took a turn slowly to the point where these characters are really invincible. Like they've survived alot of stuff a normal person wouldn't have. Now I loved this franchise till the 7th installment. The 8th one was good but not as good as the previous 7. While the 9th movie just broke me.   I'm just gonna pretend that the 9th installment to the franchise is just a hallucination.
These movies have been parodies of themselves since 7 at the latest, this sounds like exactly what I want. I’ve been laughing at these movies for years
For me they stop making good FnF movies since f5.  If Scorsese needs to hate on a franchise then this should be it.
Fast 5 and 6 Furious 7  F8 of the Furious. F9: The Fast Saga Fast 10: your seatbelts F11: The New Saga  Fast:Family
7:12 you know the memes... We didn't mean that we literally wanted to see them there 😂😂😂    I won't be surprised if fx is either dom pulling off stunts in space with his car or they all go on a universe time travel experience
What! You gave Luca a C and this one a C-? After all of the things you've said C- is a lot. This should've gotten at least a D.
The tenth one has to be called FasTEN Your Seatbelts
Fast Ten: Your Seatbelts
1:56 after the last film, the 7th film with cars jumping from building to building I've just taken them as the new Avengers 😂😂
Did It sick?
Honestly, I've taken this as the new Avengers or the creators of transformers.   You have cars webslinging across islands, magnetic cars, cars with rockets to fly into space, cars pulling a whole bank across Rio, cars surviving building collapsing, men surviving and explosion and falling from a building, redirecting a whole middle with their bare hands, superman made his appearance in number 6 how Dom caught Letty 😂   Oh wait I almost forgot, star wars was in number 7 in that fight with dom and Shaw 😂😂
It didn't feel like a Fast and furious movie but it's was so hilarious with the cipher yoda went up your ads scene that was funny
Are they wearing matching wife beaters? Couple goals...
Mate its a movie that knows what it is.....First time I have seen one of your reviews and will likely be the last. I get everyone has different opinions but your comments are borderline mockery. For a franchise you like so much you could show it better.
It wants to be deadpool
Brian didn't earn the right to be part of the "family"! xd
Seeing articles saying the actors wanted this to be 'the best movie ever made' 🥴  Sorry what surely you're taking the fucking piss hahahaha
This series lost me a long time ago. It is so incredibly shallow and dumb. A waste of cinema space.
F20 Toretto the God father
They could've just shown the DeLorean to explain Han's revival. Easy peasy japaneasy.
The fast and furious Franchise is like the Assassins creed franchise. The more they listen to memes the crazier the next title will be and the more we will forget the real identity of what it really was
I cant wait for fasTEN your seatbelts
Love the rubberband happy pride ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🏳️‍🌈month
If the next movie is going to be called FX, the actors probably won't appear as much. The whole movie will be dominated by a CGI family. Oh, not really like CGI version of the character. The movie will be dominated by literally a CGI family, the word itself.
A billion-dollar franchise: Dom and the family use cars and attach odm gears on them to slash titans. "Fast Attack on Titan".
Next up they race on Mars.
Flashbacks for the Curious
F9: CCP
All fast and the furious movies aren’t good ..
actually chris i really dont know if it was joke first but they've talked about a crossover with jurassic park and few other times they said that they want the next F&F set on the moon, .....yeah the moon ....so you have no idea what they're really capable of yet
I haven’t enjoyed any Fast movies other than 5 or 6 but I always tune in just to see how absurd they could possibly get and I’m with you, this one just went a too far. Probably the weakest in the series in the last decade
C- was being extremely nice for that train wreck of a "movie".
Can you do a conjuring universe ranking please?
Had a really fun time with this one, I laughed a fair amount and was never really bored. At one point Vin Diesel actually beats like 20 trained soldiers in hand to hand combat...this movie had no real intention to be grounded in reality and I'm fine with that, I'd give it a B- just due to how fun it was.....I do hope they manage to ground it a bit more next time though.
This movie is stupid
They'll explain what Brian was doing in F9 when he returns as the villain for F10.
My eyes widened in surprise when Chris said he is a fan of the Fast and Furious... I just bever thought he would ever be a fan of such movies
Fast Gang vs Mystery Machine is on the way...
"I'm gonna give F9 an F"... hahahaha
So these stupid movies became even more dumb. What a surprise :D
Lol remember when the biggest stake was whether they stole the DVD players or not? 😂😂
Disney should adquiere the franchise and integrate it into the MCU already
Fast and the Furious was great, mainly because it was Point Break with cars. Hit that perfect early 2000s vibe. 2 Fast 2 Furious was a fun watch and was fu nto play Need for Speed: Underground. The rest just lost interest for me.
It’s ok Dom fused with Xander cage and Riddick to somehow obtain magnetos powers in his car. 😂
Wait? Wasn’t it a comedy all along?
I don't know if Adam Carolla is going to love this movie or hate it with a passion! Either way the first Fast & The Furious was the best!
The craziest part is when John Cena teams up with the CCP on a subversion mission.
The original is the only one that I have a soft spot for.
4:12 _ 4:35 _ 7:17 LMAO
Now you know what bollywood feels like ~ heh you're welcome Hollywood ~
Have to agree Fast Five was by far the best !!!
Please... all these in the franchise are terrible except maybe the first one. Street racers who are also high tech, high explosive, army ranger types who battle bad guys, parachute in cars like they've done it 100 times. It's cringy and listening  and watching Vin act makes me angry. I can think of plenty of movies to get away from reality. It's just another cash grab for the Apple users in the world who still haven't woken up. They should name the next movie FU, cause people watching  must like the abuse.
Only a matter of time before they team up with the Transformers
I can happily say I have never seen a single one of these shitty movies.
I laughed throughout, and my child scolded me on my pointing out ripoff version scenes I'd seen in other franchise movies, telling me I missed the Spiderman one. I couldn't understand why Cardi B showed up and not Eva Mendes who's shown up in small roles in other Fast movies; all things considered. LoL. So much of it was pop culture, memes, and callback moments; even giving us prequel - origin story - material.
they might as well join the avengers
Now that they've been to space might as well go to the moon or wait even better why not mars with elon  musk spoiler alert elon musk was the one pulling the strings all along. FX (2023)
Yah was ridiculous
Why do they keep pumping out this shit... what’s next F&TF 10: OAP
Sure Chris haven't watch bollywood film with defy logic hahaha
Didn’t I hear Mia or Letty say that little Brian was “in good hands” with big Brian (Paul Walker)?
I can't wait for F10 when Dom fights God because Familly.
Chris you gotta review Batman the long Holloween part1.... Pleasee🙏🙏
This review is ridiculous tbh..not because F9 is great or anything...but the review is mostly speaking on realism and how Fast has still rode the line of realism until now? Wtf have you been watching. 8 has a literal submarine somehow going faster than cars while also pushing against ice as resistance...oh ya and the whole thing being remotely controlled. A never ending airline runway. Explosions being stopped by cars as shields. But you complained that "too many people were caught by cars". Elena was pregnant when her and Hobbs fell 4 stories on to a car but had 0 issues. Hobbs only breaking a couple bones. Like that is just the tip, and you're NOW just complaining about realism? Wtf lol
'FX'? Surely it's 'FAST10 Your Seatbelts'?
little brian was with brian o connor they said in the movie during the scene in that underground base when his brians wife showed up
Didn't Han fly to space? Solo?  Boom all the movies are starwars prequels.
Lol, Chris's face. Don't even need to watch the review.
I feel that this whole franchise has become a personification of California.  Not just Hollywood, California as a whole.  Shallow, loud, pretend-to-be-big-hearted-but-really-narcissistic-and-money-hungry California.
Your T shirt game is so strong the FF Franchise is calling to take a piece of the action lol 😂
Movie was so fucken great...you will even cry during the movie more than once... Best Scene idiot..is when Dom gives Jakob the car keys..a second chance of redemption.. Dom.." Someone gave me the keys to a 10 second car once..."
are you a fan of everything like EVERYTHING?
Movie was fucken great, and it leaves a seat in FF10 .. Han or Jakob? Movie made great sense on the storyline...   I hate people disin a great movie
The next one will either be called FX or Fur10us
Bodies breaking doorways and streetsigns? Sounds like they stole gags from Top Secret!
It’s not a fast and furious movie because it has no rock
Wait until F11…after F5..RIP logic & science 🧪 ☠️🤯
I feel like fast 10 should be about racing and bringing back all the cars from 1-3 movies i miss when it was about racing
Give me a Tokyo Drift 2 with racing and all is forgiven
It's a rolling joke at this point...family? What family? Wheres Doms mother? Cousins? His brother...Cena? The guy you can't "see?" How clever.... He didn't listen to his best friend from grade school about Brian being a cop, he didn't listen to his sister about pulling another heist, what about his child he left in a cabin to chase his fake brother? This series is absurd, it's a complete cash grab
The characters are pointing out its stupid they arent dead or hurt
Those films aren't dumb... The actually make you dumber.
Love those Pride wristbands
Why wasn't Paul Walker in this one?
FF9 is a parody of the franchise itself...
ok they didnt even explain hans death like was he in the car or not when the car blow up or how would he have the time to switch with a dummy ? lol
"100% Cartoon"😂😂
Natty or not on don he on some stuff
If you expect depth and character fr F9. that's on you my man..
I really like the F&F franchise, but I didn't like this one, this was boring, the story was boring, and a good vilain was missing. Just my opinion.
Brian is babysitting Brian, Mia even says it.
As usual, thank you for putting this into terms my dumb brain can understand/expected from such a complex and deep movie series. I think I will enjoy it a lot more now knowing its a comedy at its core
It's almost been a year and a half since I've been in a movie theater. Maybe mindless fun is just what I need to ease back into one of my favorite pastimes. Here's to plot holes, absurd stunts and... family! Maybe they'll jump dimensions in FX.
I will sure enjoy this film even if it might be the most absurd one yet, spider car, car defying gravity on a collapsing bridge, car flying to space and powerful magnets.
Went from pushing tuna sandwiches to businesses alotta physics right out the window, replace cars with guns. This is Tropic Thunder intro trailers all over again...
Love your PRIDE wrist band! Thanks for your support, bro!
What’s with Charlize’s haircut? Way to make Charlize Theron look unattractive. The Rock is fun. Way to not use him. Cena is a pandering bore. C’mon man.
They called it F9 as the F stands for Family
no, they skip 10 through 29 and go strait to F XXX and it's a direct melding crossover of XXX and Fast and Furious.
Fast and Family
Stupid and mindless.......yup.
This movie was ass.
Family
Sounds like it was furiously absurd
I actually don't understand how these movies could be that 'good' (?) for so long. But Chris is totally right, somehow they were right on the line of being stupid but being just entertaining enough to be kind of good.
F9 is an insult to human intelligence
This is secretly a psychological thriller. Brian isn’t real. This is all an illusion, Danny has gone insane and has created this fantasy where he has a brother, Han is alive, and everyone is superhuman. 🤯
Fast-Ten Your Seatbelts
After watching the first 20 minutes of Fast and Furious 8 and giving up on the movie, I knew this franchise was done for
Good to know John Cena threw the country of Taiwan under a bus for this junk.
I just look at the fast franchise now as Americas take on Bollywood.
I was hoping to see a little come back in time with a race in a Supra or something like this. Idk maybe more like the first or second one. Adios Fast 😄
So do I just stream it or wait for theatres to open n watch it on the big screen?
FEMLY
F9 was like die another day/moonraker (james bond) of the franchise. But still i think its an entertaining movie if you like brainless action movie
I feel like this movie will get better as u rewatch it.
FastTen your seatbelts
So Fast and the Furious is turning into the MCU.
I give this review a  F-
Please make a hilariocity review of this one.
Dom actually died in the first Fast in the Furious movie, after his Charger collided with the semi truck pulling out during his final race with Brian. When Brian giving Dom his keys to the Supra was Dom ascending into heaven. Everything that occurs from Fast 4 to now follows Dom’s life in heaven, where he and his family are given top secret mission impossible like challenges. They cannot die (because Dom is already dead) and are given superhuman abilities and knowledge.  The 10th installment ends with Letty and Mia standing at the foot of Dominick’s grave. The date reading (whenever he was born) to 2001   If this man doesn’t get eaten by like a fucking dinosaur at this point I’m gonna fucking kill myself.
Scorcher 6: Here We Go Again...Again
Actually the film does say where the kid is. In the safest place possible with Brian, remember in the franchise he didn't die, he just drove off.
I think the FF movies are on a spectrum. Maybe they’ll stop at F10 making it the most overly absurd installment. Regardless, the Blu-ray set for the entire saga will be dope.
I haven’t seem this movie but I already know they have a “family” gathering or cookout at the end of the movie 😂
He got it wrong Junp the sharj is for tv Nuke the fridge is for movies
Does anyone else remember when The Fast and The Furious was about street racing? I don't understand how this happened.
The movie took it too far this time. I found my self lost like the introduction of Cardi Bs character out of no where just confused the hell out of me Plus i had no idea what she was saying. Even the Explanation for Han being alive lost me. I love these flims but as you said this one lost me too. One thing that i thought would have been better then the what they did is the re telling of how DOM beat the guy with the wrench was if His brother did it and DOM to the wrap for it to protect him, It would have been such a DOM thing to do to protect family and then have Jacob fuck up while DOM was in prison which then made DOM abandon him. But anyway its all too crazy in this one
Chris you're too generous with your ratings of late. F9 gets an f bro.
I will never understand why you are so willing to give this series a chance, it's so fucking terrible and always has been. Of course this movie was going to be fucking stupid, don't even know why you  wanted to try and review it in a genuine manner.
They said Paul Walkers Character Brian was looking after the kids.
Oh shit, this movie is out already?
Taiwan is a country BTW
I still go and watch the movies on the big screen but to be honest, I haven't rewatched any of them after five. Like that movie was great all around, the plot was decent, characters were good, action was great and except maybe the vault scene grounded making them more exciting to watch. And then suddenly they started jumping from buildings, jumping over bridges, flying, falling through skyscrapers, chased by submarines it became insane.
This is Hollywood
The Moonraker of the FF series. It needs the equivalent of a Goldeneye now before it can rise again. The first three movies weren't great but they were at least earnest, the first particularly was trying for that Point Break vibe. I watched the first four movies and then kind of gave up, it went crazy with the slippery physics.
Super excited for Season 2 , oh wait , this is a movie franchise , my bad.
Fast 10 Your Seatbelt
i mean....remember when jason statham was hitting people with heavy ass wrenches and they got back up? So the whole Dom getting tossed through a wall or getting his head slammed isnt too far fetched since its been done before. These movies are nothing but action comedy at this point, have been for a long long time.
It’s a parody of itself
Who would've thought a Fast & Furious Spinoff starring Dwayne Johnson would be better than a Fast & Furious Movie starring Vin Diesel.
Chris is being too nice here. The film sucked.
It all started with chill guys stealing DVD players, now they’re going to space😕
Hollywood now is just Bollywood with more sophisticated special effects.
I thought Bryan was with Paul Walker
Next movie: F This
Honestly, even though Chris thinks the “Tyrese thinking himself and the rest of the family has superpowers” is stupid, I find it a surprisingly interesting way to advertise the film. Although, I think the reason Chris finds it stupid is maybe because the film series was just cementing its self-awareness, and Chris didn’t like being told instead of showing it.
“Kinda dumb” = understatement of the year.
The Fast and the Furious franchise should had ended when Paul Walker died.
Please bring back the original writer
I can’t believe this franchise went on after first 2 films. They just more and more terrible. Then it’s becomes just making money to sell a film.
Toretto: it's all about family *LEAVES HIS CHILD AT HOME*
The last number of these films is so ridiculous, badly acted, and insultingly stupid, yet it they make so much money. Says a lot about the evolutionary level of the audience.
Proud to say I've never been able to sit through any of these movies .
we all expected this to happen
Not planning to see this but I had to watch this review.
Anyone else think "Tokyo Drift" was actually the best one?
If I wanted mindless entertainment I'd watch political debates/
Fast 9. Based on the true story? Of course is fiction
Fast and Furious : Physics and continuity are not important , family is
Yeah Noooooo desire to see this at all
EXACTLY!!! This movie is a Key Stroke!!     But I enjoyed it!
In F11 they gonna fight the black hole.
Never seen one of these and have no intention to
Fast and furious doesn't need logic..fast and furious is the logic
i can't not wait to see this movie i am a huge fan of this franchise and i read on trivia that Fast and Furious 10 will be the final installment of the franchise and i hope it will be the final one since there is way too many fast and furious movies i am actually shock that they made this many movies in the fast and furious saga wow it a big franchise that for damn sure and i think i will like it even though it was a 5.2/10 stars on IMDb
I truly don't know if you are meant to take it seriously, I was laughing the whole time so I'm conflicted
Next one is gonna be Fast And The Fu10us.
These movies have been trash since the third one LOL
This movie will have the lowest average audience IQ of any movie released in the next five years
Brian was looking after Dom's son while he was away. It was mentioned in the scene where Mia shows up  Mia tells Dom: "Your son is in good hands" And Letty interrupts saying: "---With Brian"  felt kinda forced but what else could they do
I love your t-shirt🇨🇷
5 was the last good one.
All these movies suck
Brian (older one) was the one with little Brian.
The plot for FX should have them go to a parallel earth because diesel drove so fast and then they are forced to watch all the shit they've made over the years and then stop the actors from making this krap before it ruins there career's because the characters they find out that the actors really hate each other
Can't wait for this series to crossover with jurassic park.
7:20 they don't jump the shark, they put rockets on the shark and send it to the space...
Would have been better in Chinese with English sub titles.
Chris you hit on the nail is a horrible movie but i will see it just  see Vin Diesel lol
When Dragon Ball Z has more realistic fights tha Fast & Furious saga...
0:42 (●'◡'●)
The FF movies are now like playing with your action figures when you were a kid (outrageous car moves and fighting scenes)Like a live action cartoon.. I wouldn't put it past them to be in outer space in the next one(s), or Dom dies and they out his brain in a car and he becomes a cyborg hybrid lol..........If they actually do that in their movies in the future I called it!
0:43 Que the Krypt Keeper laugh…
FX is good but it really needs to be called Fast10 your seatbelts
So what would take a D+ rating? If someone went up to the camera and took a literal shit on it? Stuckman, I love your videos, but c'mon man, be a little more brutal if the film deserves it. It's not a comedy, so don't review it almost as a comedy, it deserves much worse than a C+. Maybe I'm just drunk? Love to hear everyone's thoughts!
It's always been shit, you're just now realising it.
Felt this way after Fast 6...Not surprised
Only liked FF1 and FF2. But I truly dont understand why the reviewers are giving good ratings to the rest of the FF franchise. Totally silly that a bunch of underground drivers can beat the best in the world. Esp annoying when Vin Diesel keeps using the word "family". The FF movies only deserve, ironically, an "F"
Even by the series' standards, this one is really dumb.
Please tell me they race dune buggies on Mars
C-
Gotta know Chris.....car guys don't give a damn as long as sports cars are constantly Drifting and gears are always shifted
John Cena is a communist confirmed.
I wonder if Chris is going to watch Fast and Furious: Spy Racers. 🤔
3:10 man of steel, when sups fell into the water with steel beams falling on top of him and then he had a flash back 😅
These movies have gotten so ridiculous, but I'm gonna watch this one anyway 🤦‍♀️
Go with 'Nuked the Fridge'.  The term worked for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
FX: FasTen Your Seatbelts  FX: Part 2 Fu11 Throttle
the irony of family when they ignore the kid.
Next film should be called “Fast Ten Your Seatbelts”
Fast 7 was the best.
This franchise crossed the line of laughable ridiculousness a long time ago. I think that not viewing the franchise through rose-tinted glasses helped me notice this and give up on the franchise early on.
I’m so fucking excited for this shit show
All of the FF movies I've seen are dumb garbage. If you're telling me this one is the dumbest of the garbage, I may have to see it for myself...
The next movie will have the delorean and will be the new back to the future
Dom is invincible it doesnt matter
Lol the 10th movie will be called “fast-ten your seatbelts”
Sounds like its exactly what i want
Dude where do you get your t shirts from! Epic!
fasTEN YOUR SEATBELTS
I'm excited for F12 picking up right after Dom dies and he's revived after they replace his organs with car parts, he becomes a muscle car itself and now has to race his long lost cousin in law twice removed, the winner wins the Family Cup.
Yeah, to me they already reached that point with the last movie and arguably the one before. Not that the franchise was ever supposed to be grounded in reality but there's fantasy and then there's insulting people's intelligence. It doesn't surprise me that they jumped the curb even further into silliness. Now all they're missing is for Michael Bay to direct one of the movies.
Please don't swear Man, I used to watch these with Family but can't  now
I’m ready for u to see The Suicide Squad
The franchise is going downhil. Also, I love your bracelet.
"Don't think. Just watch." Is pretty much this franchise in a nutshell.
As Sergeant Osiris famously said “Never go full retard”
7:34
I like the FX idea. But … how about … Fast10 Your Seatbelts. Ehh. Ehhhhhh.
10 bucks say that the 10th movie will include Transformers
Let’s be honest, a car in orbit was definitely a reference to Elon Musk corvette up in space
the explanation you give this movie to me explains the whole series..its all just over the top unbelievable horse poop..besides the first movie..
I see your "FX" and I raise you "Fast 10 Your Seatbelts"
You either die an action movie or live long enough to see yourself become a comedy
😂😂😂😂😂🥵🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So F9 is weaker than Mortal Kombat 2021 and The Old Guard, ok
You don't get the gist of these movies. They ARE super heroes  like the Avengers. I don't see anyone laughing at Avengers Endgame. You have to wait for the origin series after F10 where they tell the back story of how they got their super powers.   There will always be haters. I believe in fAmiLy!
FasTen Your Seatbelts
Their explanation for Han was the most half-assed job I've ever seen. It was like they knew they couldn't possibly come up with a realistic explanation, so didn't even bother
So, if they make a prequel and go back to the beggining, how are they gonna call it... FU?
What's the bluray with the fluorescent yellow spine near the bottom right? I will watch that film just based on the fluorescent usage.
Holy xhit, I know what they're gonna do. Around the 11th movie they'll admit that this is all some kind of... final memory of Paul as he dies or some shit. Like the whole series. But maybe he's just a normal truck driver having a speed induced fever dream? Some kind of Matrix Inception level mind game shit.
☑️🔥
Dude, they literally launched car to space, and now you are talking about it being too out there? This has already been like this many films ago.
Vin Diesel said about the film, "It's not a film, it's a tradition". If that's not soul crushingly a confession that this is a paycheck and of course it's garbage LOL... I don't know what is.   Then again I guess by the 9th Star Wars we'd derailed pretty hard too... all good things, right?
Sounds like a funny movie
chris please review netflix rurouni kenshin the final!!
I need them to go to space and freaking meet Machete
Vin diesel should have gotten a concussion and knocked out but nope because these movies are a silly cringe fest.
Longbeach griffy's skit basically predicted this.
I don't need to see Chris's rating. His face on the thumbnail says it all.
So they go to space it’s a Star Wars movie
Fast10 your seat beLt lol
Excited for this movie😎🇳🇴
Chris always has the best shirts
Can’t believe you wasted 2 hours of your life on this movie
Next: Fast 10 Your Seatbelts
The camera was just too shaky for my liking and the movie is beyond ridiculous.
Fast 10 can only be called "Fast 10 your seat belts"
By now it's time for "Alien vs Predator vs Family"
They said Dom left Brian with actual Brian
Oh no. I was afraid of this. Why the fuck did it not end after 7. Are these people smoking crack cocaine alongside Vin diesel? Jesus man. I loved this franchise once, up until 8, which I didn't care for. 1-7 were all good. Fuck. I'm afraid to watch this movie.
Spoiler                 Older Brian was supposedly looking after younger Brian. Who supposedly showed up at the end as well....
Yeah the movie sucked whatever am I the only 1 who really really want Chris's t-shirt It's so cool love Ian Malcolm
Can’t believe people even entertain these “movies”
hello Mr. stuckmann, love your reviews, I was wondering if you ever accepted recommendations for movies, if so then I would like to recommend, "triplets of belleville", its a french animated film very few people have done reviews on.
No worries Chris, you are spoiling nothing. It’s not a spoiler if it is inevitable.
instant laugh with the vid
There's probably no franchise that I hate more than Fast and Furious but I always seem to find myself in the cinema watching it. Every new installment has something that draws me in. 1 and 2 I watched because I was opsessed with Need For Speed games, 3 was all around a very good movie, 4 I watched out of curiousity and boredom, 5 I hated but it had The Rock, 6 I hated but it had The Rock, 7 was the Paul Walker tribute, 8 I skipped, Hobbs & Shaw was pretty entertaining and now I'm gonna see 9 because I want to see John Cena as a villain. Fast and Furious is like a drug addiction. I hate it and I want to stop but there's always something drawing me back in.
It's true what you said about the writer like i genieunly thought this movie was fun to watch though laughable but it was definitely lacking that emotional drama that the others had
I love these movies if only because they inspire dumbass kids to break the law and endanger lives while driving the cars and motorcycles their mommies and daddies paid for.
I want that Fast & Furious x  Transformers crossover movie!
Make the next one animated…
So this movie went full machete 2?
Man i loved this movie. 2nd best fast film
Paul walkers character was said to be babysitting Brian
This review literally makes me want to see the cringe, I LOVE IT!!!!!
The fight scenes remind me of Peter Griffin vs The Chicken fight.
F3 Tokyo Drift is the best yet closest to reality with actual cool people, no cap.
No paul walker, no Dwayne Johnson, no gal gadot, no Jason statham.  Idk if this is even worth watching
Lmaooo that thumbnail lol 😂
They jump the shark at whichever movie cross the line into B-movie territory.
Go and watch this movie 🍿 with your .....FAMILY 👀
I'm surprised it reach a 9th sequel...
They mention that Brian is watching brian
Chris, Brian was looking after Brian. As in Paul Walker.
did you listen to Fast and Furious 9 Trailer Song? its a masterpeace
F10 = John Cena apologizing to everyone in Chinese while driving the speed limit in Taiwan.
The black spot cytologically drop because shade eventually mix about a spiky dredger. mundane, tidy printer
Real question: how’s the prologue for Jurassic world dominion?!
Finally a video I have been waiting for
Yo, fam got the tire collection when Fate came out, been putting every new Fast series in it since.
"Bryan locked in a wooden box the whole time." That's dark man
Where can I get that shirt!?
7:35 c-
I thought fast 8 and Hobbs and shaw was a bit over the line hahaha
It will entertain a lot of people specially the ones without 🧠.
its only a matter of time until they start doing multiverses and time travel
The franchise lost me in the last movie. When a submarine couldn't catch up to the cars driving above it on ice, so it emerges(!) through the ice and starts actually catching up to the cards above the sea level!! Wtf? So crashing ice on every inch helps the submarine's speed? That was the moment I've decided I'm through with these films.
Wait, it's out?
So we all love great movies right? I know it’s easy to criticize these ridiculous movies. But cmon, sometimes this shit is good. I’d like to think if a car was flying at me I’d catch that shit. So yeah screw it throw it in a movie.
Fast 9: The Wish version
Fast 9: Anime.
That chuckle when you mentioned your wheel collection🤣 please say you have some hilariousity videos planned🖤
If fast 10 doesn’t have the Tagline: “Fast-ten your seatbelts” then what are we doing here😂😂😂
I dislike the Jurassic world movies. A lot. But I could like one, possibly, if it’s a crossover with fast and furious. And I’m not talking a scene. I’m talking Charlize Theron with another terrible haircut stealing a baby dinosaur that needs rescuing… I want to see a car ramp off a triceratops’ tail… Cause family.
Lol I thought 6 and 7 were parody’s so I’m kind of excited to watch 8 and 9 now
Your thumbnail expressions always crack me up.
Fast and furious is boring
The film franchise jumped the shark a looooong time ago.
I'm just going to think that Han woke up in a hospital and loss 50 dollars mite as well use GTA6 logic
Your next Hilariocity?? 😆
This movie doesn't need a plot, it has family
I really wish they stop
This review is mostly Chris talking the illogical stuff that happens in F9. And I'm living for it.
I think this was THE MOMENT when the Franchise left reality:  In Fast & Furious (the 4th film) Dom gets shot in the back and doesn't even flinch. He just looks behind him as if someone tapped him on the shoulder. And then Brian needs to remind him that they need to  tend to his wound.  From that point on in insanity and ridiculousness continued to drastically increase.
The actor who plays the kid, Brian is the nephew of a friend of mine (twins actually).
Prediction: The next movie will be a crossover with "Sharknado"...
I like Chris laugh 😊
2:12 lmaooo 😂
The trailer for it was enough to keep me away... absolute trash
FX or FasTen your seat belts!
This franchise is all in Doms head during cryosleep
Haha I saw the trailers and there is a scene where he jumped off that big truck and in that second he hits the floor he crackes it like ok you should be the one that’s cracked not the floor
No way next one has to be FAST10 Your Seatbelts
“Family”
Spoiler alerts; in FX they will jump in a car from earth to Mars...
I think the problem is right in the title.  Any series that needs NINE, much less 3 or maybe 4 installments, jumped the shark looooooonnnnnnnnggggg ago and it now lives in cash grab land.
Honestly 10 needs to go back to it's roots since it's "suppose" to be the finale. The team split after a mission gone horribly wrong & our Government now pose the team as a threat. They are now being hunted by law enforcement but the film mainly follows Dom and Letty & digs more into their relationship. They begin to race again to gain money for survival on the road. The movie should have many emotional beats involving reflecting back on those they lost from the original crew and exploring this time that Dom and Letty get to spend together during their travels. This is the vibe I want to see! It deserves to be taken seriously again or else this buildup was for nothing.
I liked the first movie when I was like ten. That is literally it. It will never cease to amaze me how long this fucking eye roll inducing abomination of a franchise has continued to exist.
these movies would be much better without vin diesel, he's so boring
I'll admit every now and then a Fast and Furious movie does work.
Bro, I love your reviews, and I respect your opinion, but I could not disagree with you more about everything you said about the previous F&F movies. They have been just as absurd and awful as this one going back the last 4-5 movies... I feel like we have not been watching the same movies here.  🤣
"What about Brian?" Barry Watson reprises his role from the 2006 EPIC comedy-drama as the new babysitter of Brian Marcos. Mayhem to soon ensue, next fall on TBS.
Still can’t wrap my head around f*ckin Roman Pearce becoming an astronaut
The next one should just be called FU and they stop.
I pretty much checked out of these movies after seeing an RPG propel a car into buildings.
no chance that luca is  one tiny tier above this shit show
Fast and Furious, "gravity, we don't know her." But seriously, I'm waiting for them to go into space. *************************************  ************************************* LMAO I wrote this before the spolier
It might sound weird... but it's nice seeing Chris Stuckmann energetic about this review. Seems like he had fun making it.
“Who is babysitting baby Brian?’ This is no lie but apparently as part of FF canon, he is being looked after the ‘real’ Brian (yes Paul Walker’s character - he’s retired) whilst his wife comes out of retirement to save the day🤯)
That forced laugh he has is terrible.
They will in space for F10 fighting Bezos and Musk.
RESIDENT EVIL VILLAGE REVIEW!
I keep mentioning the bridge scene from the trailer.  That was all I had to see to know how far overboard they were going this time.  I think they are trying to top Hobbs and Shaw because that movie had absurd physics and car stunts and they were kind of indestructible. I'm going to just see how the bridge scene is resolved.  I know it will be ridiculous.
I heard a minor spoiler about the end and it involves a certain character "coming back" and man it's getting desperate.   It's about Paul Walker and they're hinting he might return.  Guys, he's dead,the character got a good send off,let it go. I feel like it's bordering on being tasteless. The man is dead and you can't undue that. Putting in a CGI face on his brother or something will do more to prove how unsettling it is.
This series should have stopped at 6... All the loose ends were wrapped up nice and neatly.  Most of the characters had happy endings, we found out why Han ended up in Tokyo, and why Gisele wasn't there.
I’m showing up high as fuck for this one. A+ for me
Mindless action is why I cant....SPACE??? GTFO..
Nowadays crap readily gets a pass. That's the sad truth.
My beef is with Tyrese and Ludicrous. They went from being interesting characters to pathetic versions   of their former selves. Relegated to bickering, annoying, extremely problematic ( their constant attempts to ‘win’ Ramsey was just friggin gross🤮), whiny and irrelevant sidekicks. Very sad
Toretto's Kid: Where does God live? Toretto: God lives in your heart Like 10 Seconds later Toretto: I will always be in your heart  Is he equating himself with God???
Love the jp t-shirt Chris
Honestly I don’t want to hear anyone shitting on Michael Bay after what the Fast franchise has become over this decade.
I only watch these drunk so I should be fine
Had a blast but I agree that they got bogged down with the flashbacks and the mama Shaw scene
Haven't seen 7, 8, & won't watch 9. Look what they did to my boy.
I'm proud of myself for not ever having seen any of the F&F movies the same way I'm proud of myself for never doing heroin.
Been waiting for this! 😁😁 Haha what a shit movie
Anyone else not sure what the hell his shirt says?
Mia says that they left Bryan with...Bryan
LMFAOOOOOO
Where can I get that JP shirt!
hmm i wonder what people think about the physics and logic behind Avengers endgame
The next movie in this franchise needs to be called "Fast 10: Your Seatbelts"
They both would have died at 3:55.
Chuck Norris doesn't fear death, he fears....FAMILY
Fast Fiv5 is still the best one. Should've stopped there.
Fast and Furious in Space
I haven’t seen this yet but I’m assuming that the next Hobbs and Shaw spinoff film is about them babysitting Brian
gonna need that Hilarioucity
I agree, didn't like it.
Brian is babysitting Brian. They spoke about it when Mia shows up. Dumb movie but exactly what I expected. Great turn your brain off fun for me
I hope John Wick doesnt go down the same route since they canned the creator.
review kinda sold me actually ^^'
where you get that shirt it epic
It wouldn't have mattered if this was the best Fast movie ever. Once John Cena became the weakest man in the world, by giving a pathetic, groveling apology to China, I won't ever watch it.
They're all Furyans.
They have John China in it. Makes sense.
Is Cipher ever gonna die, I feel they’re stretching that character
You lost me in your first sentence sypher didn't hire Jakob she was captured by jakob
I really don't mind how outrageous the series has gotten. It's a movie, it doesn't have to be real or follow real world physics. All that matters is that it's a fun time.
Hey Chris, Can you do a spoiler review Fast and furious9/Fast 9 or Iron man 2 review, Chris st
This series is just live-action anime
The commie John Cena is in a movie...
They may have lost you in this movie then I can only say pretend you're watching The Last Action Hero every time you are watching one of these insane movies in my opinion. LOL!
This was all about the cars. Practical effects (mostly), in beautifully tuned 90's and early 200's era cars. They lost those after Tokyo Drift, and they lost me with them.
Everyone looks like theyre reaching retirement home age fast and furiously
sounds like exactly what i want in a f&f movie honestly
This was the first time I fell asleep watching a F&F film. When Chris said the middle section drags, it draaaaags.
Chris, you need to redo your Army of the Dead review. Please!!
I'm hoping they call the next one Fast 10 your seat belts
I remember my friend seeing the trailer for the previous one and going "Wait, when did this become a superhero franchise?"
I thought it was an ok movie but not the best movie at all but great review as always Chris
100% I’d go to watch this purely for entertainment and absolutely nothing else, and at least the trailer marketed it correctly
F this movie 9 times
They need a more grounded spin off similar to Tokyo Drift. The story needs to be smaller in the next one, saving the world is too big
Come on Chris just be honest. They are all fucking shit movies
10th is gonna be called the Fast and the Fur10us I swear
chris has the best shirts, i need that Visit Isla Nublar shirt!
Cars...  In... Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
The thumbnail says it all
It really should have ended with Fast Five   my rankings :   1. Tokyo Drift  2. Fast Five 3. F6 4. F7 5. The original  6. F4 7. F8 8. 2 Fast 2 Furious
Fast and Furious vs the Avengers 2023
I like how honest you are
His face one the thumbnail lmao
When I watch this movie in theaters I will just laugh at how bad it is and even when I watch the trailers I knew this was going to be the room style bad It’s like the room but more action and if Tommy Wisue was bald and doing ridiculous stunts hell I’ll even laugh at the scenes that are not intentionally hilarious I bet fast 10 could even meet aliens if this movie could go to space what if they meet aliens 😂😂
Has... Chris not seen the other films in this franchise? This seems pretty par for the course.
The ultimate summer popcorn flick that I would only watch on Netflix
It honestly should've ended at 7 that was a great ending and then just do spin offs
Can someone tell me if this is spoiler free or not before I watch it
if you wanna make money in China, please dont insult China by saying Taiwan is a country.
Love you reactions... loooool
I love how you can basically get the gist of the review from Chris’s face in the thumbnail.
If Fast 10 isn’t called “Fast10 your seatbelts” I’m not watching it
Chris laughs are back. That’s how you know how bad the movie is.
I couldn't even make it through this review, let alone the movie. Why would any serious critic even bother reviewing this rubbish. It somehow legitimises the movie, which it really shouldn't.
When you got the family everything is possible so stop with the hate Chris .🤣
As someone who doesn't really have any investment in this franchise this movie was an absolute blast in the dumbest but best way possible
I saw Lindsay argue that the Fast and Furious trilogy is basically the male equivalent of Twilight, and I wholeheartedly agree: just a whole bunch of gender pandering bullshit with plot as an afterthought Neither are my thing, but we all have dumb things we enjoy xD
Thank you, great review as always
Fast Five was the shiznit. 6 & 7 were good too, but then 8 was the one that lost me. Wasn't the same without Paul anymore.
Chris looking traumatized on the thumbnail tells me everything i need to know
How ppl are feeling about this one with all the ridiculous stuff. Is how I felt about it since the 3rd one
I can't believe they made a big budget action movie about the F9 Key.
I can't ever imagine a day where I have so few options that I say to myself..."today I'm going to watch a Fast and the Furious movie". I'd rather just watch The Silence of the Lambs for 80th time. Love Chris's reviews though. Sounds like  C- is too generous....space??🤣
Damn this movie looks terrible. I'm still going to see it though, I love the absurdity of it.
Chris Hombre Atorado
Just give us the FF and Transformers cross over
We are waiting for another Hilariocity sir Stuckmann 😄✌🏿.
I got to the point Chris is with this after fast 5.  Anything after Tokyo drift lost itself
The only fast movie i really enjoyed and the only one i ever saw in cinema was Tokyo Drift. And that is because it didnt had all these clowns from the cast, doing bullshits and posing everytime. I always regarded Tokyo Drift as a Karate Kid movie but with cars and the premise of the movie was really cool.. it was all about cars, drifting techniques, racing, a troubled kid trying to fit in this world, bullies, Japan culture, superb music tracks, no out of this world and every logic stunts and no bad jokes that tried to make the clowns look cool. Too bad they changed the formula into that of a weekend kids cartoon with cars. Oh and Charlize Theron is as awfull and annoying as ever as she was in the last Fast movie.
They say Bryan is looking after the kids. (Paul walker off screen)
The Tire or the En"tire" collection?
It’s funny. It seems this one did to Chris what 7 did to me. The whole flying through skyscrapers in Dubai, just pulled me out of caring at all for the franchise anymore. Which I know there were TONS more unrealistic things before then in this series, but when I saw that… I just checked out. Completely
F9 went over the moon.
I absolutely loved Fast Five, and I also thought it had a brilliant ending -- and for me, that is where it ended. When I realized 6 was going the soap opera route of bringing Letty back to life, I knew the absurdity was overtaking what little reality was left. In my mind, the reunion/farewell at the end of 5 provided a sort of full-circle closure that a great film that randomly became a too-long-lived series/franchise needed and it should have ended there, before we got super spies, genetically enhanced soldiers, rockets to space, and other nonsense that really has nothing to do with a rough-and-tumble family of car enthusiasts that were heisting VCRs, for gods' sakes.
I'm sure I am the only student of film that has never seen any of these films. They just seemed about cars and muscles and I have zero interest in any of it. Also they seemed attempts to make Vin Diesel a mega star and have never been a super fan of him. I like some of the films he is in but he has never been the main reason for that. I'm definitely not a hater just not a huge fan. FF. just was never my cup of tea... I did like the first xxx film. lol.
I "theorized" that in F10, it's revealed that they're all androids.
Fast10 Your Seatbelts is still my favorite fan title and honestly should just be them saying shitty puns the entire time. Not like anyone remembers the dialogue anyways.
I stop before you get to the spoiler. Despite usually taking your review in to account before watching a movie. I probably will watch F9 anyway.
Horrible movie made for stupid people, that's why it keeps breaking box office records... smh  I want a Hilariocity
“You’re telling me they’re laughing at us, not with us?”
I'm sorry, the last movie had cars surround Dom to protect him from a fucking nuclear submarine explosion! They've been a parody for a long, long time.
I don't watch these mobiles there are stupid and ridiculous.
My agent put me forward for the role of a Astronaut in this film. I thought at the time "They can't be serious?". Turns out they were. Cheers Chris :D
You have the en-TIRE collection?
Remember when Hobbs and Shaw had a literal super soldier, if that didn't lose you, then what will?
What does F9 do to Windows? Break it, of course! *ALL PUNS INTENDED*
These movies have always been a guilty pleasure of mine. Fast cars, gun fights, explosions, fight scenes and beautiful women. Tied together with something resembling a plot just coherent enough to make sense. Riding the fine line of absurdity to not break the suspension of disbelief too much. They're hilarious. They're stupid and ridiculous but they're fun.   They know what they are and they embrace it. I hope this movie is the same and they don't go too far off the deep end.
*FAMILY*
So what I’m hearing from you is that an Justin Lin should direct a G.I. Joe movie? Into it.
Maybe Vin Diesel has a Crystal Skull? ( ...literally then does 20 reps of continuous legs sweeps)
This franchise has been a giant meme for me since the 2nd movie. Just reallyyyy dumb nonsense lol.
Finally it has become a parody of itself
Ngl, I’ve thought these movies were comedies from the very beginning. Maybe this one will be the funniest 😎✌🏻
Ew
Planned on seeing this until John Cena. Hate to be that kind of person but what he did was pathetic beyond measure.
FF1 best FF
F9 can go F itself.
it is the single worst movie i have ever seen
I can't believe I have to correct Chris about a FF movie, but Chris, they did mention that both kids were being watched/babysitted by Brian(excuse for paulwalker not yaknow)...
Hopefully in 10 they....time travel. Dom will be like "we gotta go faster than we ever have before"
When i want to watch a FF movie i just say "i wanna turn off my brain for 2 hours". It's more enjoyable that way
The fast and furious should have aliens and predator and terminators and skynet just for the hell of it
May not be able to call it fx since it's the name of a channel so yeah trademark
"This is the closest to hilariocity they have gotten with this franchise"  Because Idris Elba being a legit super-powered fucking supervillain is everyday life
Is it just me or was Chris a little soft with the C-
Can’t wait for the pitch meeting for this movie
Chris my father and I love these movies and our favorite is fast 5 but also my father and I call these movies no brain movies which means turn your brain off and enjoy the show don’t ask questions nothing will ever make sense case and point the rock driving an ambulance off the overpass onto a drone blows it up and getting out completely unscathed in fast 7 that would never work in real life either you die on impact with drone or on impact with the ground but you don’t question you just enjoy it
For some reason, the phrase "...but then they're brought back into action when Tyrese and Ludacris show up." made me burst out laughing.
Uhh Mia said they left them with Bryan actually.
They kind of jumped the shark with Fate of the Furious, although I loved Hobbs and Shaw.
I hate these movies. But yet I still see every single one….
Fast 10 Your Seat Belts
5 best one ?
The mad lads did it, they actually went to space.
each _Fast & Furious_ film is just a parody of the previous one…  except _Tokyo Drift._  that one was actually a real movie.
Having saw the film early I think it's more of how people describe the ridiculous of a F&F film then neccesarily what the films were. Like they took all the ridiculous fan ideas and put it into film form.
Fast X : when your here your family lol
They mention in the movie that little Brian and Mias kids are being baby sat by Brian (Paul walkers character) since he’s not actually dead in the franchise. He’s the one is the Skyline GTR at the end coming to the bbq
I think we all know, that Fast Franchise is just a prequel for Riddick. And soon we'll see Dom fighting Aliens
if you fall like 40 feet going 60mph, but you land on the hood of a car instead of the ground, you’ll be fine.
Dom literally walked away from a parking structure falling on him and you question his ability to take a Door Frame? Ill bet Good money Mr. Glass is looking for these guys! 😂
So they went full shonen. A surprise for sure, but a welcome one.
They might be hero’s, they survive the dumbest things.
FUR10US perfect title 👌
The name of the movie is F9. 😳😳 Anyone thinking what am thinking
I just want to know, who did Ramsey end up with, Tej or Roman?  It's Tej. We all know Roman isn't built for long term relationships. Lol.
The name of the movie is F9. 😳😳 Anyone thinking what am thinking
FasTen Your Seat Belts
Can we just end the fast series already… I checked it after Tokyo Drift
I guess Chris Stuckmann is beginning to Drift away from the Fast franchise...
So chris is using a Jurassic Park Shirt while reviewing a FF movie.  yeah, i got the reference xD
Fast and furious films are absolute aids.
Next installment will be called "Fast X". Taking alot of influence from Jason X. It'll take place in outer space, and Vin Diesel's character will eventually transform into "Uber Dom"
FX or Fast 10: Your Seatbelts
I have legit only seen Tokyo Drift. Seen it once and that's the only thing I ever needed to experience about this film franchise.
Physics does not exist. Only family does.
Yeah, that was strange they brought back Han even know he died in car explosive from Tokyo Drift.
Trading crypto now should be in every wise individuals and investors lists, in some months time your profit is assured.
I'm sorry to say I'm not surprised. Womp womp.
The child didn't get left behind, it was his dream with all of the characters in it.
Is Vin Diesel's co-star Mark Wahlberg or Jean Claude Van Dam?
Yes but family
I knew they would eventually go into space
The next movie is obviously going to be called Fasten: Your Seatbelts...
That dead stare look on the thumbnail tho , said it all about this franchise.
I can believe whatever crazy car stuff, but setting a John Cena and Vin Diesel up as biological brothers..? I can not suspend my disbelief enough.
Fast and furious went the way of Saints Row
Still better than Army of the Dead.
Enjoyed the film can't wait for 10 and 11
Fast 8 had a submarine that went faster than cars on the surface.... My personal favourite 'madness' 😂.  I watched the trailer of this and its enough for me. I'm officially out of the fast franchise 😂
So Tyrese & Ludacris will be the first two black guys who go to space without studying? Astonishing. 👏👏👏
bowing down to china lost me
Oh yeah it's June how could we forget?
Can someone please spoil for me how Han comes back? 😅 I’ve been racking my brain over how he survives that explosion and istg if Han slipped through a manhole last second 💀
Can we all talk about how incredible Chris’s shirt is?
I stopped at F3. Did I miss anything?
When will Vin Diesel and his family finally take on the Transformers?
*"They call it a keystroke. The movie is a keystroke."* ~ Chris 2021 ⌨⌨⌨
Family and Furious
This film is so far the most ridiculous in the franchise and I like it. Fast & Furious is my type of junk food in cinema. I saw the film on Thursday and Vin Diesel was there.
Dom's son is being taken care of by Brian, since Brian is technically still alive in the franchise. He's just "retired"... also not Letty's son since Cipher killed his mom.  This movie is so long winded, you will check the time a lot! Is it over yet? Is it over yet? And yet they're making 2 more.... WHY?
What happened to Baby Brian?….I’m assuming a car took care of him. (The cars can do anything in these movies)
AT THIS POINT IT IS A COMEDY. and I’m here for it
Its like a bollywood action movie lol
There bringing Brian back for part 10 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Come on the tag line I Fasten your seat belts
Tokyo drift is still my favorite
Aw man, I lost a little bit of respect for Chris after saying he was a fan of this series.   I know F&TF is supposed to be a bit of mindless action garbage but it's just too far fetched and stupid for me to ever sit through a full movie.   To say *this* installment is science fiction is a bit ridiculous, they all are.. they're just a complete meme of a franchise.   Also, Vin Diesels head really is that hard.
Chris’ explanation of the orbit and rocket part just killed me 🤣🤣🤣
The fight between Deisel and the rock was pretty badass and well chronograph but then after that .. They are trying to replicate that with different actors and just not the same
Fx lol
This movie is literally the animated parody 3 3ast 3 3urious in live-action form.
They lost me at part 7... When the cars started flying though the skies of Dubai. Part 8 was particularly horrendous as well ......with the so called sdouble cross with Dom. Here's hoping they get that cross over with  the transformers soon. Or not. I dont care.🙂
They need to strip some of this down and go back to basics. I actually thought the backstory with the brothers was interesting and made more sense than I expected it to since it very clearly was a retcon. The Han retcon, however, was awful and makes no sense.
This review actually made me want to see the movie sounds amazing
I thought 8 was bad but damn this one was hard to watch cause of the realism thrown out the window and then straight into the sun
What happened to the other baby?...🤔🤨
Why not a car chase on the moon with a Ford Galaxy and a Mercury Comet in FX!
Was it one last ride?
No Fast movie will top Tokyo Drift.
So you're telling me they managed to one up the finale to the Crossroads game where they raced a giant rocket? Imagine that.
Remember when the fast saga were about tunning cars, gangs and street race?
Hubbs and shaw was the pinnacle of over exaggeration
Honestly, all we need is a Sharknado VS 'the Family' crossover at this point.
Hehe , John China
Where can I get that shirt
Please review Trese! Pretty please!!! It's a mystical horror anime set in the gritty yet lively streets of Manila. I'm sure you'll love it.
And who else can they bring in to join the crew. Next, it’ll be Mel Gibson as Dom‘s uncle or Schwarzenegger as Dom‘s long-lost father who didn’t die in a race when he was a kid
BREAKING NEWS - Fast N F/urious 10 has just been announced. Dom Grandmother has come out of hiding and she's after them both.
Fast and Furious 50 there's never a Last Ride
I think Chris Redfield punching a bolder is more believable.
The first one was good, street racers in LA. Beyond that, it’s a parody of Marvel and DC superhero movies. It’s just so far out of hand now that I think giggling is the only way you get through it.
Review Wrath of Man, please.
Shut it off after you said your favorites are 5 and 6. Tasteless.
Give it an F or -9
All these films have been comedies. They have always been the best comedy of the year they come out. I cant wait to see it and LMFAO.
Next it will be fast N furious  in SPACE. HORRIBLE FRANCHISE.
F10 is gonna have electric cars and Elon Musk is gonna be the main villain
When Vin Diesel suffers less damage than Superman during a fight. Damn! :p
Well 3 is Tokyo Drift and that's fuckin terrible, not even worth watching
I disagree, the next one should be called Fast Ten: Your Seatbelts
The most unbelievable thing I've seen from these movies is that somehow, The Rock isn't Vin Diesel's brother, but John Cena is.....lol wtf.
Happy pride month Chris
Fast Nein: The Fast and the Führer
Fast five was the last good one
Does Justin Lin direct the action sequences or are those done by second unit directors?   If the dialog scenes are bad that is actually the director's fault, since he's in charge of those.
dumbest movie in the dumbest series ever... put them to rest forever.
I laughed at the “Minions” joke towards the end. That was about it. For the rest of the movie, it was just “huh?” after “what?!” after “nope…” after (eye roll). It did not help that someone would always say something to wink at the audience “I don’t believe it.” Like, come on. How did anyone see this and not think “okay that is impossible.”   And the friggin’ climax was LITERALLY in the trailer. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️   F
Not a bad review. Brian was watching lil Brian and their kids all the time. And actually with the flashbacks it can be a lil emotional. Otherwise very entertaining for a Fast saga fan. And a fine review
Oooh, I totally thought you were going to give it a C+
I hope John Cena used the opportunity, being in the movie and all, and profusely apologized to his masters for calling Taiwan a country again.
WE NEED MORE MARVEL MOVIES..... LOL JK
The next movie has to be called "Fast10 Your Seatbelts"
LOL IMAGINE ACTUALLY WATCHING THOSE FURIOUS DAST MOVIES.... BAHAHAHAHA 😂😂😂
Where’s the In the Heights Review
So dom and mia aren't Latino?
I know most people outside of latinamerica won't understand this, but...  "Chocan en el aire, weon! EN EL AIRE, WEON!!!!"
They need to just bring back a Tokyo Drift like movie. Even though the acting was horrendous, the racing scenes were pretty cool and believable. It was relatable in the way of making people wanting to mod their cars.
Brian was babysitting Brian
I think that Dom is actually a terminator. I don't remember what FF movies was, but there is a scene where Dom gets shot by a gun in the back, and he just literally turns back with no sign of pain from the wound or the impact lol.
ITS A MEME!!!
All downhill since the rock punched a torpedo
It’s been a cartoon for awhile. I would like to see them take on an R rating and get more violent and gritty. Take a risk
Wow stuckmann video mistakes, unsubscribe.
Family
FX is a TV channel eheje
Love the t-shirt. I'm going to see F9 for the very same reason *wink wink*
This movie is so bad that I walked out…And I was in a plane! LOL
Hey Chris, please review The Secret of Kells 2009.
FFF.......Furious Fast Family. All about a dad trying to get to the airport to catch a plane....but leaves little Brian at home.......alone
Is this the one where certain individual explains in chinese that actually certain isle is not a country?
I am so desperate to see a film in a theater I'll even take this. I've given into the madness! My doctors says I cannot because I am still immunocompromised from chemotherapy but hopefully I should be good by September or October. I hope so because I WILL see Dune and The French Dispatch and No Time To Die and Last Night in Soho in the theaters. (Shit, October's gonna be a good movie month!)
I don't get the appeal of these movies and never will.
Chris I kinda want all your thumbnails to look like this regardless of how good the movie was
Shit movie, a D- is more appropriate.
Me: (sees the thumbnail) uh-oh
F9 is what Mission Impossible would be if it the creator's didn't have a brain.
This honestly might be one of your best reviews yet
“The Fast and furious”  name, will always be a throwback of your youth thus you would watch it. It has become that kids fantasy of reacting those action movies from the tv series era of “Viper”, Hercules Xzena warrior princess, Team knight rider and debate who would win a fight between robo cop and terminator
The first film is still the best, easily. That movie will always be great. Fast Five may objectively be second best but I prefer Tokyo Drift. Five comes in the #3 spot.
They needed to keep Jordana Brewster out of the franchise too.
Brian was being looked after by Adult brian(Paul walker) they say it when his wife turns up
I love how they're always catching people on car hoods like they're soft and aren't slippery as fuck
First one was the best. They took all the elements of Point Break and made it a car movie. Also having great identifiable cast.
Mia's kid and Brian were baby sitted by Paul Walker's ghost. in the bunker scene they say "the kids are safe, they're with Brian"
the jurassic park shirt wasn't a coincidence I'm hoping....
Just wondering when Diesel and gang are gonna hop up a Space Shuttle and start doing some real drifting in outer space. I mean cause that's where this thing is headin'. I thought chasing a military cargo jet down a runway for a half hour was a bit much but come on bruhs.
I didn’t even realize there was a new one out
Yeah they ditched Statham and The Rock, but those are actors with actual work. Check the core cast in fast and Furious and check their IMDB. They need this franchise, specially Vin that kinda has to catch up with Dwayne that doesn't stop working at all.
F9 just burned out the entire franchise's tires.
I'm just so grateful that Chris' video format and end screen have remained unchanged for so long.
They're gonna fight Thanos next
Jesus they’ll never stop in 2053 we’ll get fast and furious 35.
I couldn’t take it anymore , I believe i quit watching in fast 5
I stopped caring about this franchise after fast 7, not bcoz of Paul Walker but the characterisation became cheesy
I literally predicted That Jakob will become a protagonist and help other superheroes
IMO  it's gotten to the point where they need to stop making them  I think they have done everything possible with a car in these movies  they have ran out of ideas Put it to rest  I stopped watching these after 5 it just got ridiculous
It's F9ne
Family
The fast and the furious is an anime basically
I give it a -F
The rock added lot to this franchise, he is missed
This is a film franchise that has never interested me. I was in my early 20's when the first one came out and I didn't care about it then. Nothing's changed (for me anyway) I was just surprised the franchise has went this long.
"[The sequel] has to be called FX, because if it isn't called FX, I don't know what the fuck they're doing!"  That got an audible laugh out of me, well done.
Chris went in to watch the Jurassic world 5 min prologue (explains the shirt lol) and then realized “oh yeah…I have to review this movie”
I don't know why this franchise couldn't stick with the storyline of criminal street racing and all of the aura that surrounds it. Why it shifted into this mission impossible, international spy agent bs boggles my mind
Did you really have to expect much from this laughable franchise?
3:54 why are they kicking their legs like that?...
I want Chris’ laugh as my ringtone.
they are more superman than a Clark Kent superman hahahaha
I’ve been a fan of this franchise since I was probably 10 (so more than half my life). But after Bobbs and Slaw, the step down that F8 was, and now with F9 I think I can officially say I’m done being a fan from here on out. To me these movies have gotten so (for lack of a better term) stupid which wasn’t the appeal for me in the beginning.
Fast ten your seatbelts....
Tbh Chris you talking about how utterly ridiculous it is only makes me more excited for it. F&F is basically just live action anime at this point.
lol, I see an 8 minute video time and I know it's gonna be good.
I've between waiting for this finally
Was hoping you'd give F9 an F.
I’m sorry, but I can’t wait
cartoonish that's what i said  first time i saw the trailer from this movie
They should've called it F9: The LAST Saga smh
Surprised it took this long to get this ridiculous.  I stopped watching after it got away from street racing
Fast and furious 9 THE anime edition.
I enjoyed the movie but can agree it was absurd. Just to clarify for Chris if he reads this, Mia did say in the movie that Brian was watching all the kids because he is still alive.
I just never got the love for this franchise. The 1st movie wasn't terrible. It was decent, but it's snowballed into something beyond bizarre. I'm all for insanely stupid movies that know exactly what they are. I loved the hell out of 'Sharknado' because it knew how dumb it was. But this franchise just seems to think that, for the most part, they're cool and fun. Some movies are better than others, but the franchise as a whole is just...meh. They've milked the hell out of it and this latest one looks so bad that it isn't even an enjoyable 'bad' movie.
hobbs and shaw trailer knew fast 9 release date when hobbs wakes up from bedits shown on the clock -this is despite the delay -- keep in mind hobbss and shaw was about a virus - - trailer also says shock to the system while showing 2020 hobbs and shaw that is
I mean the 1st film had them driving under semis so...
Welp guess they don't got to space this time around figured they'd wind up on moon to stop some lazer or middle thing and they'd need some antigrav tech on there cars to catch it in time.oh well maybe in F10
They should have called F9 : Fine (Fast+Nine)
The next hot wheels is looking great
We had jump the shark now, we have we sent the car to orbit.
I refuse to acknowledge the spin-offs. Looking forward to F9 regardless of antics, but hopefully this franchise comes to a close one day. It is definitely getting out of control.  But it's made billions of dollars and is a generally "original" franchise. We should be clamoring for more.
I've said it for years now. They should just merge with Transformers. Think of the over the top stuff they could do.
How did you not get lost on the serious with Fast 7 jumping cars from building to building! PS Fast and the Furious started getting terrible around Fast and the Furious 4. Also Dom never had a little brother!js
I don't need to watch the review now... the thumbnail says everything I need to know.🤣
Who the hell needs logic when you've got family?
I like how qt 2:08 he just can't explain how dumb the movie was it just fried his brain
Saw it 2 weeks ago and, even though I knew it would be just a dumb movie like most of the previous ones, I expected to at least have fun watching it. Instead I was questioning why I'm even watching it. As you said, they take it a bit too far a couple of times in each movie but still keep most of the movie grounded and at least somewhat believable. This one is the other way around... there's a few moments that are believable and the rest is pure sci-fi. Everyone else in the theater seemed pretty disappointed too.
At least we STILL HAVE BRAZIL 🇧🇷
I didnt like fast 6, but I like Tokyo drift, 7 and 5 are best in my opinion. I wait to see this when it out on DVD release
Han is back ? WTF !
thanks man , big like for you , was so fun to watch  your review
At this point...I've seen the tapes  listened to numerous news casters and even body language Experts...I BELIEVE Johnny was ABUSED by a sick calculating Narcissist!!! I have no interest in watching her in Anything! I WILL NOT WATCH HER EVER!!! dont care WHO is cast in Aquaman...ANYONE but AH!🙄 Psyco Bitch Has Got To Go!!!  JUSTICE FOR JOHNNY AND EVERYONE THAT HAS SUFFERED NARCISSISTIC ABUSE
I've always loved your tattoos man!
Saw most of the franchise in theaters, I left that out of my comment
I've never seen one of these but now I want to see this one
Oh please, just be done with these movies already.  Bring some originality to Hollywood.
Nothing will top the submarine speeding through the ice 😂
Chris, can you make a review for bo burnham inside?
😂😂😂😭 4:12
Chris, please, reply to my very humble request and very frightened heart... do you have ANYTHING about the Alien franchise? Any news? Personal predictions and what you think may happen? Can you make a video on it?   Please reply to me please I am so concerned and sad...
So sounds like Super fast 2 😒 Great
Can we get a video on your tattoo's Chris? Your ink is awesome.
That shirt has been popping up on my Facebook ads lately.  Looks pretty cool.
The whole franchise is just trash I never could understand the appeal
Oh wow, I didn't realize that Chris Morgan wasn't writing this one. Go figure
Toretto: "It's about family" Chris Stuckmann: "really stupid and midless film" Torettos crew: *hate stare*
The franchise was getting really bad and then the rock came on board which added a bit of spice to it and now that he's gone it's just fuckin bad lol
Asian Dom: you can have any car you want as long as its a corolla
Everyone in F9, tear through the environment like Dark Souls characters.
“Its kind of a comedy” theyve all been goofy dumb comedys with fast cars for me lol.
The sub in the last movie wasn't a hint as to where this was going... 🤷‍♂️
All of these movies are comedies like Vin Diesel said the street always wins stomped and a parking garage collapsed. The rock said daddy has to go to work then flexed his muscle to break his cast.
They went to space, next movie they will go in another dimension.
What happens is they all died in ff4
Fast 10 should be called « Fast Ten Furious »
Yo where you get that jurrasick park t shirt , i love it
The movie needs to be called ‘FFX’.
It's makes you wonder if the pandemic effected the production and the writing of the script as well?
Review Justin Lin’s tv show warrior it’s on hbo max
Tokyo Drift will always be the best one
I suspect they aren't superheroes. They've all died and are in purgatory while the rest of the Lost crew are are on the island.
Next one should be Fast10 your seatbelt
Can the franchise end at 7 please for f sake?
Damn, talk about a 🍋. Cars swinging on vines/wires? HA!!
Maybe Brian was babysitting Jr. By the way, is your JP t-shirt a hint on what Universal is planning to do with both FF and Jurassic Park franchise?
I’m so old I remember when Vin Diesel was famous
If we all just realized we’re one big FAMILY all the worlds problems would be fixed since FAMILY is the most powerful force in the universe.
Glad you mentioned what they did with doms kid for the hole movie. But what did they do with Bryans kids. Him and mia had at least 2. And she is in the middle of the action
"Realism", yeah that's a good one!
Next movie is gonna be called Fast 10: Your seatbelts
The En”tire” collection
At one point, I had no doubt that someday, F&F would merge with transformers. We're one movie away people I can feel it.
Next movie... F YOU.
I loved Tokyo drift, better than anything that came afterwards
This whole franchise lost me when, while watching the Fate of the Furious in a theater, I realized that I had wasted my money
Preaches family, takes 9 movies to mention Dom has a brother 😑
Fans: where is the logic Dom: gone reduce to atom
Don: Family above all for the past 8 movies Also Don: LITERALLY FAILED TO MENTION THAT HE SECRETLY HAS A BROTHER.
🤣👍
I think I have heard “FX” (which yeah I agree would be absurd of them now not to call it) is gonna be the last one which judging from this review is about damn time   Also that F9 keystroke really got me at the beginning, well played, Chris 🤣👏🏻
How can you say FX should be the next title when 'Fast Ten Your Seatbelts' is RIGHT THERE
Chris really tried hard to tell us how hardcore of a fan he is by showing the tire display and giggling on that edit! 😂😂
Hey Chris, why do you review shit movies like f9, bodyguard and luka? I miss your old segments like I saw the devil or lake mungo reviews
Just reading the synopsis on wiki, I was just like wtf. Every little thing happens for 57 different convoluted reasons. Han can't just be alive, he had to have been secretly working for Kurt Russells character after learning his dead girlfriend used to work for him. Dom's dad can't just die in a random tragic accident, it had to be because Dom's brother messed with their dad's car to try to get him to lose the race so he can somehow pay off his debts. Look at that, Cypher was flying a plane that got hit but a truck and crashed, she's probably dead, oh wait, she was actually flying the plane using a computer simulator from across the world. Like my God.
With how crazy it sounds I hope they merge it with Jurassic World... I just wanna hear Dom say “family” over the Jurassic park score
Can’t wait till they join the Marvel universe.
Dude the F9 button killed me me lolll🤣🤣🤣🤣
You mean this movie is absurd? Quit drilling you’ve already struck Oil. I’m sold going to go see it on Friday! I’ll bring the edibles.
its a bunch of kids telling stories about their parents
I honestly stopped watching after 6.  And I was the biggest f&f fan. But. Idk. They just lost me after 6. Sucks
They called it a key stroke 🤣🤣🤣
Did we get paul's brother?
They really jumped the quarter mile with this one guys.
'...Which many people have suggested they might go one day...' Fast 9 goes to space confirmed.
Eight sequels too many.
So this franchise went from NFS Underground to NFS Most Wanted to Mission Impossible to Matrix?
Ok but does it have family?
Kinda disappointing hearing you say the writer of 2-8 isn't part of this one. I always loved the absurdity but it still felt grounded, this sounds like they went full looney tunes
I'm telling you fast and the furious franchise is basically a live action anime about fast cars and adventures
Literally have never watched a single one of these movies except for the first one and the one with bow wow
Super fast 9
Tokyo Drift was good and thats it.
you missed the point, its about family
I should be paying attention to this review… but that shirt!! Like come on Stuckmann!😱😍
Wait a minute, Chris thinks it took 9 movies to jump the shark?
I legit picked this movie to see with my friends over Cruella simply because I know it’ll be a lot more fun to watch as a stupid summer movie
Sorry have we been watching a different franchise? Every single one of these films are the finest comedy can offer.
Going to watch this movie with all my friends very drunk. Going to be a blast
I wish they'd connect the sequel to XXX. Don realizes that in a previous life he was Xander. Or that he has a twin.
I’m with you Chris. This movie didn’t feel fun like the previous few
F9: Judgement Day
FX: Dom's "sister" returns to destroy his family bc SJW's come for the franchise 😂  I really hope not though.
1st F&F 01 was good all about Japanese tuner culture and LA street racing. Rest are certified BS that made franchise over billions $$$
Thank you!!! I needed this review. These movies are AWFUL. I can't believe people actually like watching idiotic things like this. Such a funny and awesome review
Wait 5&6 are your favorite… you’re opinion is NOT valid!
This is when the franchise lost you? Anyone recall the “kick the torpedo” moment from Fate of The Furious?
Does anybody feel like they could just not watch the next movie, because I “Feel Like I Do”.
F9 jumped the shark.
I say once I say it again this franchise die when Paul walker sadly pass away. RIP Paul. Honestly felt like this franchise shoulda end with 7.
I want to see Vin Diesel fighting Optimus Prime with a wrench in the next movie
I am so happy you reviewed this movie. It was actually shot in my country, Georgia, I was there during summer when they were filming. I have not seen the movie, but I would definitely go and watch it. Thank you Chris!
expecting a hilarioucity for this one
Eh I’ll just wait for Fasten Your Seatbelts.
Fast 10 wheelchairs. My grandma and grandpa would love that.
Fun fact they actually drove the bank vault down the street in fast 5, no cgi just stunt drivers
Chris stays dripped out with the exclusive T-Shirts.
What ever movie Vin Diesel jumped from that skyscraper I thought they jumped the shark or you could say they jumped the building 😂 funny how these movies are coming to close as the Plaid Model S marks the close of the internal combustion engine too
The only movie I enjoyed was the first two.
LOL the Thumbnail of Chris...Cracked me up!...Surprised he gave it only a "C-" not lower.....lol
You don't want to be in the cinema with the type of people that will love this movie. By the end of it you'll want to launch them into space.
Stopped watching after Tokyo drift, it has gotten to ridiculous for me.
Not that it's a good thing but the franchise has been this way for a while now not sure how Chris just realized about it.
I say fuck it— next FF movie theyre fighting dinosaurs or werewolves or something
Not F9, F me for watching it
The directors never told us that all of the Main characters have legitimate Superpowers.
5 is my favourite too.
Chris, they did mention adult  Brian was looking after Brian, it was when Dom’s sister showed up 10 minutes after I was like who’s looking after Brian. My husband and I thought the whole movie was hilarious and we had fun 😂. What got me was the flash back scenes when the were young adults, it was meant to be serious but then I noticed that Young Dom was like 10 cm taller than young Jacob, but in current scenes Jacob is like 5 cms taller, like Jacob had a growth spurt in his 30’s. 😂 Then the car in space, they are holding on the stirring wheel, trying to direct the car with no wheels or or wing flaps, like how is moving the stirring wheel directing the car ! 😂
Sure they said all the kids were being baby sat by Brian (not the kid one)
I've never seen one of these films, except for the first one and Tokyo Drift (which is the only one I liked); but from what I've seen, is it safe to say that now it's on the same level as Sharknado?
Tokyo Drift is the only movie in this dumpster fire that I can look at without wanting to die.   And that's because the driving in that bullshit more than makes up for all the shortcomings it has.
Press F9 to pay respect to the physics of this universe.
I bet they don't name it FX because they're dumb.
Probably the worst period in history to be a reviewer. Truely abysmal
How are there nine of these? I love schlocky popcorn flicks but these movies aren’t even good enough for that in my opinion.
Treating these as a comedy has been key for the last few installments
Chris, ❤ your shirt, where did you get?
The real question is where is Brian???
The Marvel Cinematic Universe must be subtly bleeding into The Fast and the Furious franchise! 😲😂🤣
Fast Ten Your Seat belts more like FFX
We stopped believing in realism with this franchise a long time ago.
In the next film, they need to have a high stakes global chase as an enemy from their past comes back to haunt them: the trucker who got away and nearly killed Vince!
Vin Diesel is parody of himself at this point. He wants so bad to be superhero but his other movies where that is the case have failed. Riddick, XXX 2, Bloodshot. He's just a parody.The movies have become just as terrible as the ride at Universal Studios.
I am going to straight up give this movie a A++ About time they stopped flirting with absurdity and just did it.
I was barely hanging onto this film & I love the F&F franchise..Once the Fiero was launched I was done, completely lost me..lmao..
They’re just getting everyone’s mind ready for the Jurassic park crossover
Vin Diesel will reach mars before Elon Musk
Let's be honest. Have you seen action movies from either China or Bollywood? They're exactly like this. Hyper action but somehow the violence feels kiddy.   I am not hating on either country. Far from it. It is simply the tone and style that appeals to where the money is. I get that. But equally so, to me and most other filmgoers, it will feel silly.
I say the worst part is that John "I am so sorry communist China" Cena is in this one.
When you said the 5th was your favourite my soul wanted to leave this realm
I like to think of these as this generation’s cheesy 80s action movies
The whole time I am just trying to figure out what the hell that word is on his shirt lol
The "pause" moment make me laugh...hahaha
This franchise needs to die already
Oh no. They gonna use the thing they did with idras Elba in Hobbs and Shaw cause it is fast and furious. I’m 90% sure they gonna use that to explain it. Bullshit
1, 5, 7 are the best
“FX” better introduce Clark Kent
Ugh, I keep hearing reviews like this over and over, about how they pushed the absurdity WAY too far.  I'm seeing it on Friday and I'm kinda nervous.
This movie is a C- for retard people...the movie is a totall F
The Fast and Furious franchise lost me years ago. I can watch most of them except the 2 latest because they are too stupid. I like Hobs & Shaw though, that one was nice. This one doesn't any better. But it's not just the stupidity in the movies that makes me not liking them, it's also the attitude from Diesel and Gibson. Diesel is trying to sell that the movies are about family, yeah right.   And Gibson got mad at Dwayne Johnson for accepting the role in the Hobs & Shaw movie and pushing up the making of the next FF movie. Just sounds to me that he's jealous which he is allowed to be ofc but being mad at someone for accepting a role in a spin-off movie just sounds petty.
I didn’t like seven or eight or Hobbs and Shaw. But I’m still conned into seeing f9
They're just mindless lazy cash grab movies like a lot of kids movies w/ a ton of sequels. Watch them mix holiday movies with f&f like they do with Madea movies lol. Also I don't think fans of this action fantasy have even paid attention to the fact that this franchise said it was gonna end three times in three seperate trailers for different sequels lol
The whole franchise is a bad joke.
Chris... How the hell do you grow such a pristine beard? Every time I try I look like a garden hedge someone gave up on halfway through trimming
It’s amazing how they’ve went from petty thieves to this…
Um why hasn't Chris reviewed Soul yet?
Sorry I'm late to the party, I was too busy watching that new stunning trailer for The Suicide Squad!
Lmao the F9 key
That face tell all
Chris I love the shirt.
"FasTen your seatbelts" that should be the name of the next one.
“Don’t expect this to be emotional powerful or something” Don’t you worry Chris. That has never been in consideration for this franchise.
I still can't wrap my head around john cena being vin diesel's real brother in the movie.
Only thing worth watching from this movie is the Jurassic World Dominion 5 minute preview on IMAX screenings.   Also you're wearing a Jurassic Park shirt...crossover confirmed? 🤔
I'm only going to see it for the jurassic world dominion preview lol
Hopefully they'll go back to their roots in the next film.
They fought a *submarine* and this is where he draws the line? How terrible must this movie be.
Worst movie franchise. It only matches the stupidity of Halloween and Friday the 13th idiocies
Worst franchise of all time
It's like they have the indestructibility and physics from the 3 Stooges, cut out the comedy, and replace it with Michael Bay madness.
On the real Bro, I’ve blacked out of these Films after fast 5 🤦‍♂️ Imma watch it but I’m sure it’s gonna be disappointing
Also please make a HILARIOCITY vid for this film pretty please.
I miss the good old days of green neons under the chassis and illegal street modifications. Being pulled over by the old bill for racing…And Hector…
You mean I've seen Fast 9 before even Chris Stuckmann
Chris Hollywood embracing south Indian movies TOLLYWOOD
I know Vin Diesel is older then Jon Cena IRL but he looks younger then Cena. So he should have been the younger bro in the film.
I suspect the Vin and Rock fight looked good because they actually don't get along, they probably weren't holding many punches lol. But yeah this franchise man... at least 10 will be the last.
Fast and Furious is pretty much part of the MCU by now.
Imagine 10 comes out and Paul Walker just walks in man missss him alot in these movies
I lol'ed when they drove from city downtown to a mountain range in a matter of seconds
Brian Toretto was left with Brian O'Conner. Mia mentions he's looking after him and their own kids.
Are they part of the MCU ? or Snyder’s universe?
You have the tire collection but not the entire collection... Not yet at least.
I am very disappointed that meme of going to space wasn't saved until FX. What a missed opportunity.
They're still milking this franchise?
Space?
I remember in F7 (I think) when Dom and his girl fall on top of a car and later she says "How did you know that car was there to cushion our fall".  I fucking lost it i couldn't stop laughing my ass off, for the rest of the movie i was giggling I couldn't help it.  That's the most retarded line i've ever heard in a movie.  There are days where I am just driving and out of nowhere I start laughing like the joker because I think of that dumb line
the fact that this one is not a hilariocity is a final proof for me that Chris has lost his way...
Chris might be hinting..F10 will have dinosaurs
I always love Chris's take on things and solid review overall. But Chris! C'mon! A door frame?? That's nothing for these guys! Vin Diesel didn't even flinch from a gunshot - and that was FIVE movies ago! Realism has long since been totally irrelevant for these films. I really hope they don't start expecting me to give a shit now
F9 stands for, fuck, there are 9 of those films?
This reminds me of the Resident Evil movies. The first two were still kinda believable but after that everything went batshit insane.
Don't the movies that come out right now have any marketing? They just throw out a Fast & Furious which feels like a week after the last one, and I've never heard of it.
I never seen any of them. Thanks for the review. 🏆
Since Paul Walker died, this whole franchises catch phrases about "family" are just being undermined by all the crap from the actors...the feuding between cast members, airing their grievances with each other and the studio on social media, absurd ego-stroking stuff like how many punches Johnson and Diesel throw in a fight scene. Some of the F & F films are decent (like Five of course), but this series has become the most joyless cash grab in movies today, led by Diesel who is so desperate to maintain some kind of movie star status, and trying in vain to keep pace with Johnson. I think we can give up on Diesel trying to stretch himself as an actor at this point, which is too bad because he was fantastic in Find Me Guilty.
I'd like to think Bryan is holding down the farm while dom is saving the world
That thumbnail says all. lol
Well… you know, when bend backwards to communism China, and promise the next one in China… physics and logic will automatically log off the conversation
I hope the forgotten sons name is Brian Tuna Nocrust
I have never and will never watch this ridiculous movie series. I dont need to watch the movies to know how ridiculous it is.
when you think about how this franchise started and how it's going it's actually quite amazing.
They lost you on THIS 1. 😬
This film is a cartoon.Just go watch the cartoon on Netflix that is less laughable.
Fuck it Chris, THIS IS A HILARIOCITY!
This franchise lost me at “I’m black Superman” lol
F9 has become a Bollywood masala movie without the songs and charisma.
Where did you get that shirt? I need it!
I guess you can say, “They really rode the rocket down the runway for this one.”
Two reviews in two days?.. You're spoiling us Chris! 😁
I won't see this due to Jon Cena boot licking to China
THIS movie is laughable. I think you meant THESE movies are laughable. Tbh Tokyo Drift is the only one that's good if you're a car guy. The rest are like you said science fiction.
Just think, 2 more movies to go to finish things off, but god knows what other spin offs are in the offing.
Suspension of disbelief is gone.
I think at this point we all know that the Fast & Furious franchise is mindless popcorn entertainment
American Made Bollywood movies for China
Im going to give F9 an FU😂😂
The minute you start to take this franchise seriously, it loses its appeal. I haven’t taken these movies seriously since Fast Five. As long as I go into the theater expecting stupid and ridiculous things, I’m going to enjoy myself.
Around the globe?...... I think you mean access our flat stationary plane.😉
As if I couldn't give a f... I give nine of 'em.
I'm watching a fast & furious movie.  I'm expecting a ridiculous hilarious cartoon🤣🤣
I knew they would eventually push this line, but I thought they'd save it till the last one. Kinda like "let's go all out who cares it's our last movie". Regardless the fast series last me after 7. Just wasn't the same anymore and to crazy for "street racers".
Waiting for the movie where they have to save the Corona beer factories from terrorist takeover while aliens are invading with a T Rex chasing them in a Bugatti.
Common, science-fiction does not deserve to be compared to FF.
''F9 is directed by Justin Lin'' *Shows a picture of the F9 key*  LMAO
Tire collection.... don't you mean the EnTIRE collection... hahah..ha... ha...
4:34 That big dude is the UFC Heavyweight world champion, literally the baddest man on  the planet killed by a green screen billboard
F9 deserves 9 F's.
I can imagine myself laughing so much If I watch this with a couple of friends and some beer.. And I'm fine with that.
It os explained who is sitting Bryan - Brian is sitting Bryan and he's and Mia's two other kids....  But it is the weakest of the movies, but i still was entertained.... But i would agree on your grade....
Hollywood movies are now becoming very ridiculously, too much use of CGI, nothing real at all. Absolutely too much far from reality.
I was never going to watch anything with Cardi B.  The review is irrelevant,
Ah here... I'm watching Chris' review before watching F9 because I won't watch F9
That rainbow wristband! HEART!!!!!
Fast and furious has been on the same trajectory as Saints Row, just slower. So, I’m guessing they’re going to finish it off with a full blown alien invasion, and only Dom’s gang can stop it. With cars.
Family 😬
Sad to hear the main fight scene is only a minute long, I wanted something at least 10 mins long like in They Live.
Easily one of the worst F&F films. One thing that's really missing that's important to this franchise is brotherhood. We had that with Dom and Brian in the earlier movies. Furious 7 was the climax of that. In the 8th movie they had Hobbs and Shaw at the heart. They weren't a carbon copy of Dom and Brian and they provided a lot of those brotherhood moments, albeit infused with more comedy. Hobbs and Shaw movie digged even deeper into it. This movie, however, has none of that. It's just same old boring Dom. Roman and Tej have great chemistry, but they're just side characters. Han is also thrown in late and doesn't do much. Therefore, there's just Dom in focus. I guess Jakob was meant to be the replacement for Brian or something like that, but he was actually a villain, so brotherhood was non-existent. Then Jakob suddenly became good again and went away. We didn't get much of him as a brother to Dom.
CIA Person: Toretto (Vin Diesel), you can’t survive in Space, there’s no oxygen!! Toretto: You don’t need oxygen *grabs onto eject switch* when you got family
Its just a stupid movie,enough said
0:43 that’s that old man Laugh 😂
Show your anime collection!!
Woody Harrelson is in DC, Marvel and Sony. Damn.
They should have walked away when Paul Walker died. Fast 7 had a great ending. Just leave it be.
God ur each and every word man.... Ur just Too good... Just fucking fucking too good.... Love u boss
If fast 10 isn't fasten your seat seat belts I'd be disappointed
Now that I know that they answered my prayers and went to space,I'm definitely watching it.
I’m just looking forward to the Jurassic World 3 teaser
Cosmonaut Variety Hour said it best, "These movies are anime."
I've heard Vin Diesel saying that he wants F&F to crossover with Jurassic World. This series just needs to R.I.P. & be rebooted.
As Fast&Furious film virgin- the description you gave was how I viewed these films as an outsider. Knowing the 9th film has more  comedic value, its swaying me to want to go see it.
I stopped watching after F5 honestly. I was only interested in the cars and racing.. and that’s not to say F5 was bad. i just didn’t go in expecting a heist movie.
"Fast 10 Your Seatbelts" coming in 3 years...
Fast and Furious is the greatest american anime
Quick fact: The vault scene in F5 was actually real and CGI wasn’t used for that scene.
F10 will be a Sharknado cross over. 😅🤣
FX will be about racing spaceships through the galaxy against aliens. Remember this comment.
That joker laugh you got is amazing
I got lost with the Fast franchise since Fast Five. Fast 4 I thought was alright but then Fast Five happened and they had to include The Rock in it just for more punching and less racing. I still love the first 3, yes even Tokyo Drift because that movie was all about racing and competition.  Everything else feels like it's trying to be Mission Impossible now.
I've only seen the first movie and Tokyo Drift so I couldn't care less, but I can tell this one is pure garbo
Favourite reviewer .  Peace , from UK 🙌
They should call next one "Fast-10 Your Seatbelts"
The Avengers of the automotive universe.
No FX title, it’s going to be called “FasTen your seatbelts”
Ohhhh God I waited for those words.... 🤓
F10 will be FasTEN your seatbelt
I enjoyed the first 7 F&F movies but I still think Fast 5 is the best one by a lot. The action was over the top but it still existed in some sort of reality. The movie had a good amount of heart too. With F9 they have gone so over the top that there are no longer any stakes. It’s hard to look at it as anything other than a comedy. It’s a shame too because Furious 7 would have been a perfect ending to the series.
Maybe they need to make a very simple one that focus on life and passion about cars by fee of our fav characters from this franchise.
They should have scaled back everything down to the roots of the franchise, street racing and heists. For lack of a better comparison, the film Logan, that went from lycra clad super heroes to something more relatable and grounded.
The kid was in the trunk with a sippy cup! Duh! ;)
Truthfully, with the whole going to space thing, I've been saying for years that there should be a Fast & Furious x Transformers crossover movie. In my mind, now that they've gone to space, it practically writes itself. Would be a way to reboot Transformers and keep F&F upping the ridiculous
7:02 Heartbroken, Mr. Stuckmann. Allow me. Take a giant step for mankind.
Chris's giggle had me giggling too 😂
this is why I can stand fast and the furious anymore. they crash cars and get out like nothing happen and start to fight. the first movies were more realistic and where more about showing cool cars. the need for speed movie felt more like fast and the furious 1
Fast and Furious: Mission Improbable
I wish so badly for them to go back to underground street racing roots with tuner cars rather than factory stock looking brand new cars. Maybe even bring in a whole new cast so they can go back to the underground street racing roots
Chris grew up with F9
@0:36 he catches her falling with the metal hood of his car. WTF. Wouldn't her landing on the dirt ground be much safer in that situation. Were the writers on crack?
I wish they would just go back to street racing.
Why is this franchise still going?
In short, another weak movie in the installment. Shame. They are running this franchise into the dirt.
4:33 that sounds like the start of Top Secret where the Nazi soldier just plows straight through a stone bridge on top of a train. Parody has come full circle!
Chris you should really watch two must watch foreign films The Color of Pomegranates and Solaris, they are both genius masterpieces of cinema.
Fast and furious : the star wars - where dom flys his charger to space and destroys the death star and saves the world 😆 and darth vader is paul walkers brother that happened to b his evil twin that was seperated at birth and shot into space as an experiement and saved by aliens
The main reason why this movie will suck - John Cena. 💩
I used to think the fast saga was a tragedy (for cars), but now I realize it's a comedy
Hey Chris, no In The Heights review?
I’m gonna go see it purely to see the Jurassic world preview lol
I can't wait for the last FF movie. I think they're gonna call it Final Fantasy.
John Cena speaking Chinese as he apologized to China for some ridiculous breach of etiquette ruined it for me. He is dead to me, and an embarrassment,
Vin Diesel is still hoping for an Oscar.
They lost me too Chris 😩 as far as I'm concerned now, Furious 7 was the finale
The trailer had me laughing, so I'm gonna probably die of laughter when I see it
<Jack Nicholson Joker voice> where does he get those wonderful T’s
You mean to tell me they had an opportunity to do a stunt WITH Elon Musk's car, and passed on it???
Total Trash Franchise.
Back to the furious. That's the new time travel theme next year.
The sad reality was the first film was decent but it was never strong enough to build a whole franchise on. But it made money then they used walker’s death to fuel trashy film after trashy film. Define irony a whole film franchise held up on the tragic death of someone killed in a frigging car crash! There just rubbish films sadly first one was good and Tokyo drift had impressive stunts the rest are just not worth watching.
When we get to F12 can we reboot this?
I didn't even know the 9th one was out, I mean I knew it was coming since it's this franchise and they apparently won't stop until the actors are too old to do them but this franchise lost me a long time ago. Every movie except for the first 2 were over the top and ridiculous and it literally gets more over the top and more stupid with every movie that comes out. It's pretty obvious that the main cast just needs money for rent or some shit so they keep on doing these stupid movies.
My favorite was Fast and Furious 4, then 5, then between 1 and 6
The movies is ridiculous and stupid alot of bullshit i never like fast n furious in the first it look stupud
Maybe it's just my age showing but the first one is still the best.  Undercover cop, team of robbers involved in the underground street racing scene. Brian saving Vince on the truck. Just awesome shit.   No hate btw. It's kinda cool to see the franchise still running with OG actors 20 years later.
Chris: This one is a comedy. Me: Always has been.
my wife calls these her favorite superhero movies  , i do like them :)
you have to accept the fact that it’s a cartoon live action movie
Fas10 your seatbelts
Of course this movies ridicuolous - theyre chasing a ghost driving a car the whole movie  The only thing i want from this franchise is arnold shwarzenegger and stallone teaming up together as the bad guys 😎
The next one needs to be called either "FX" or "Fast-TEN your seatbelts"
You right it could of been awsom if it was written different but this krap here I was laughing with other people in the theater
Should have waited and just gave it the hilariocity treatment
Sadly they already made a movie called FX.   It was good, but FX 2 was better.
They lost me after f7
This was the logical course for these movies, Chris.  They've been pushing the laws of physics and reality more and more each movie.  I'm just waiting for the universe ending device they have to time travel to stop.
I said it when it back in 2015, Furious 7 was the best sci-fi comedy I'd seen in ages... The hilariocity continues
No, the next film should be titled either FasTen or Fur10us.
PLOT TWIST: Dom and his family are part of TVA and resurrect Gal Gadot from Death
We all know the next one is gonna be called: Fast10 Your Seatbelts
It’s going to be called “Fast Ten Your Seatbelt” but FX does make a lot of sense
since paul walker died its gone to shit its all about vin diesel and how he's the best blokes a twat should of stopped at 7
FF making Michael Bay movie (Transformers) look miles away logical ngl
Thankfully, we’re one away from this 10 film entry story coming to an end, then we can all just go on living our lives not giving a shit about the spin-offs. I said in my review of the trailer for F9 that I was getting worried about the franchise, in this one movie they had to deal with the struggles of not having Brian aka Paul Walker (but having Mia somehow), bringing back Han, introducing a never before mentioned brother of Dom & Mia, continuing without Chris Morgan, and still pushing the bar on over the top action after 9 movies. Honestly, I’m a little bummed that this one didn't live up to what I had been looking forward to in the climatic 2 movie conclusion to this beloved blockbuster franchise that C. Morgan had originally planned on giving us.
It’s official Fast and Furious has evolved into a westernized live action anime without powers but they somehow got all these superhuman powers still😂
This video generated old Chris energy and I loved it!
2:36 “Who’s babysitting Brian?”             “Family”-Dom
Brian's fking dead.
Love the bracelet, Chris! Happy Pride Month. ❤️
Dom is always leveling up in every FAF movie.
:)
Fx should embrace time travel and go back to the beginning where it all started.
in the next one, they'll realize they are in a videogame franchise
Thank you for your honesty on this one, you would have lost me and many others were it not for this review. This was by far the worst film of the franchise. Completely absurd!
Space. they went to space.
fuck i was looking forward to seeing f9 this weekend. Fuk dat i ll just stay at home and binge 1-2-3-4-5
This series has been a joke ever since 6 came out so nothing new for me
This movie Sucked
" This movie will entertain alot of people"....  With low IQs.
AMC
The F9 key joke got me lol
I kinda wish these movies would go back to the fast five style, ridiculous but still feels grounded
fast series died with 8 when they tried to replace Brian with another white dude and gave him the same clothes and car
And still, you give this movie a better grade than TASM 2? I mean TASM 2 wasn't really that bad, but you gave it a D. Why?
I'm kinda dissapointed cuz Cena was apologising to China not long ago. He's the CCP's dog🙄👎
Can Thanos snap this franchise from existence?
Fx (F10) is preparing for Dom with the power of Family to take over the transformers cars and fight the Avengers for team supremacy.
It's OK if you want to talk about Spoilers, no one cares.
Always love this man's shirts.
Family!!!
great vid!  also Yay, we bracelet bros :-)
its okay man they got their skills from illegal driving
I'm glad these movies are finally getting the credit they deserve for being terrible. They've gotten a pass for way too long in my opinion.
Cast ANYONE in the role of Doms brother and this movie would have been 1000% better. John Cena CANT ACT whatsoever. He scowls and uses Batman voice throughout the ENTIRE movie which was horrible. Outside of that its just another Fast movie.
The fans were literally joking and trying to meme when they said the next fast and furious was gonna go to space and they go ahead and do it lol I'm calling it right now, they are gonna go to mars and drift the Mars Rover
They did get me with that mid credits scene though. Mf’s
Fast 10 spoiler . . . . . . . . . .Family
When FX comes out they better be in space, pulling the moon with an American Muscle car.
Han is back from dead like Kenny off South Park.
They have gone full “Sharknado”😂😂😂
Final Grade: FAMILY
Your face expression on the thumbnail said it all. 🤣
I think this will get more viewers since people will go just to see Dominion preview
Was waiting on this review I think this series ran its course
This franchise is such a dumpsterfire. It's not even enjoyable because the action is terrible.
I'm surprised you actually like the franchise. Mad Max Fury Road is extreme action done right. F&F has been a parody to me for practically the whole series
A lot of people watch every sequel of Fast and Furious because they would stop making them a long time ago if the franchise didn't make money . They should have ended it at 5 with happy and satisfying ending  for most characters .
This is the avengers wym???
That door frame being smashed was literally like a cartoon.😂
i will only accept the 10th one if it's set in space
2023: Fast 10 Your Seatbelts  Dom’s long lost sister causes WWIII and the gang uses time travel to stop it using nothing but the power of family
What are they gonna do next "Time Travel"?... OH SHIT! I just them a plot for the next 3 movies.
So this movie is very Fonni then 0_0? I will go in xpecting that it is fonni :D
I wish this franchise would end, and be gone forever
Maybe the next one is a tie in with Rocket League?
I made a joke a couple of years also about them going to space..  Now? Where’s the next frontier? Time Travel?  Mark my words then, if there’s Time Travel, go back to this post.. 😅👌🏻
I don’t want this movie to be like anything or any of the others. I just want the franchise to stop 😓
This is disheartening to hear. I was really worried that they’d keep working towards complete and utter absurdity, and it seems like they finally made that jump
"Honestly, I didn't realize how much the writer... got it." - Chris Stuckmann 2021
F&F are like Kojima games, where you don't know for sure if they are 100% sincere or the entire thing is actually a troll.
Fast and the Furious is an anime....
Honestly - I wanna be Vin Disel. He makes stupid movies with his friends, then make a killing at the box office, and go home with a gazzilion dollars.  He is living the dream lol.
So basically Hollywood finally caught up with Salman bhai ( I love him bdw)
I remember almost nothing about 8, I lost interest after that movie. I’ll see it, but not right away
Plot twist: Hobbs and Shaw were watching little Brian 🤣
Next movie FX featuring the holographic return of Brian aka Paul 🚶‍♂️er n Johnny Tran with Gundam x Honda 2000
Next one will be called FasTEN Your Seatbelts and it will just be a 90 minute traffic safety PSA until Dom wakes up and they reveal it was all just a dream and he was in a coma since the crash in the first movie
Hey Chris by the way that's not Dom and Letty son... This his son from his  previous relationship with Elena which was revealed in The Fate and the Furious!!!!
They just invented Physi-fi.. forget sci-fi..
This movie is definitely about family and cars
Well...I haven't seen this whole franchise just yet, just bits and pieces online, plus a few moments from Hobbs and Shaw at work; Movie Theater. I have been thinking about watching them, but from what I've seen, yeah they are pretty stupid, but can be fun. But if Nick Fury doesn't show up at the end of the next one, cause I know there will be, I'm gonna be disappointed.
I want to watch f9 because of what they will show in the starting
Was expecting a D after all that
First time I don't feel like going into a movie theater to watch a fast & furious movie. I'm saving my money lol and its not worth the risk in this pandemic
I haven’t watch all of them but at 6:14 why is she fighting like she’s black widow ? In what movie did she learned this ? Lmao I can’t wait to hate this movie.
I dropped F9 once I saw the clip with Dom & his “bro” fighting couldn’t take it serious lol. Not like I took the previous ones seriously but it wasn’t as ridiculous as this one
John china ruined this movie for me before ive seen it.
If something doesn’t make sense just remember one word: family
FF went down hill when Paul past away. None of the movies make sense anymore.
This comment section is hilarious 🤣
7:02 When Chris was explaining the movie, throughout the review i had a serious face. The moment he gave the spoiler about going to space in a car with a rocket engine, i bursted out laughing!
Scientists: That’s not how physics work Dom: I ain’t got physics, I got family
This whole franchise is basically a better comedy/action orientated version of the Saw franchise - constantly jumping the shark but still entertaining. Like the latter franchise, however, it seems it’s jumped the shark one too many times
Brian was babysitting brian
I am confused from your review. I mean, how the f*ck didn’t the previous F&F movies weren’t comedies for you? They were always ridiculous. Laughable af. Who takes them seriously?
Didn't listen to anything about the review, I was too distracted staring at that tshirt
This one could be the best of the franchise as it looks like it has the most girl power!
It went off the deep end into a Fantasy Super Hero Movie .. Hint you will walk out of this movie if you don't take it as a Big laughable Joke.
Any chance for an In the Heights review? If not it's fine I just like your reviews😁
I still only remember the first two, which were actually more about cars and racers than crazy whatever is happening right now. Well, maybe 2 sucked, honestly, I don’t remember. Was that the one with electric harpoons? I should probably watch Tokyo Drift. Anyway, after it leaned into action and explosions and all that crap - I lost interest. Watching the one where they raced with the submarine and torpedos in the end was already hilarious enough for me.
*I live my life a quarter mile at a time*
Love the end credits where they show Optimus Prime teaming up with vin
I didn't even like the first one.
Anyone excited for snake eyes
I’m just having a good time reading some of these comments y’all leavin 😂
Chris would you agree that Dom and his Crew should fight the Avengers at this point?
Tokyo drift was my favorite
I'm just laughing at the thumbnail, me. That bad?
I’m convinced they will find a way to go into space…..*watch’s till the end of video…..oh
I disagree Chris. Fast and the furious 10 needs to be called “Fast10 Your Seatbelts”
Well I mean Hobbs and Shaw were fighting a cyborg…so it IS science fiction haha.
Ask any fan, any real fan. It don’t matter if you make 1 or 9, fast and furious is fast and furious.
The fast and furious franchise in one word family
All I know is of they have a Fast 12 they have to call it F*ck 12
This sounds like everything I asked for in a Fast & Furious movie. I wanted it to be more... dare I say... LUDACRIS.
These movies are like eating a huge jar of cheese puff balls.  You can’t stop 🛑, it’s all fluff, and in the end you’re sick of it.
In Fast 10...they will go back in time with a Delorean and prevent cipher from  becoming villain
they finally went to space this is so epic
THE FRIGGIN BANK VAULT DID'NT LOOSE YOU?!
"The" best movie reviewer on net
So what score chris give to this movie? I didn't whole video.
Han comes back from the dead, Dom has a brother that he NEVER mentioned and everyone is superhuman.
Fast 10 : Your Seatbelts
Damn man, you just described every single thought I had about the movie just from the trailer. Part of me hoped it wouldn't be as bad as I thought but now I'm disappointed it's exactly as I thought it would be
We’re still going to have those people that think they’re critics and will rate it as if the movie is trying to win an Oscar 😂
Vin Diesel is the new Adam Sandler
I’m surprised that Chris didn’t mention that the trailers spoiled most of the film
They lost the opportunity to have the rock and John Cena fight lol
If this is too absurd then we are in trouble for the next two sequels.
Bro been eating to many pizzas 🍕 lol 😂 this guy needs a conjuring 😂 sent in the mail bud lol 😂
Vin diesal constantly preaching family only to abandon in his son to go beat people up with cars
I always know when you don't care for a movie because of your facial expressions in the thumbnail! I love it!
Fast 5 !!!!!! My favorite !!!! Much love all the way from Arecibo Puerto🇵🇷RICO🥁✌🥁✌
Horrible movie.
'Member when The Fast and the Furious was just an accidental but really good Need For Speed Underground movie?
Tokyo drift and #2 are the best ones if we’re being honest
I stopped watching FF after Paul walker died may he Rest In Peace 🙏🏼
These movies are terrible, with a capital T. The first one was and is the only watchable movie. Crazy shit is, DC make movies and they get torch'd by critics, but this franchise has 9 movies, I'm sure we'll get a 10th, and they have a spinoff. These movie aren't anything more then cash grabs. So go head, keep throw'n them your cash..
this franchise is really 12 movies?
I have that same collection Chris! Wheel and all. Lmao. It should be a spaceship now tho apparently. 🚀
Another copy and paste FF movie. Pass
This should have been hilariocity. I feel like Chris wanted to give it an F.
Fun fact they actually did the cars attached to the vault it's actully amazing work by the stunt performers
I still want fast and furious mixed with Jurassic world. Give me Dominic torreto chasing dinosaurs
"When you're here, you're family. Breadstick?" -Other Diesel
So, it's basically Saint's Row III turned into a movie.
Glad I'm not the only one, I was able to see this movie alot earlier then everyone else in the States. I'm a huge F&F fan and have more or less loved all of them, and I knew that they were dumb popcorn films. 9 was horrible, honestly its destroyed my wanting to even watch another movie or this film again, which I can easily do for the previous. I always thought they should have ended it at 7, but Vin diesel wants to go for 10 cause that's what Paul Walker wanted aswell, also I hear Vin wants a stand alone movie now like Hobbs and Shaw which..well itll be so unreal and stupid that he could've beaten Thanos with his Charger and the power of FAMILY. Idk what's going to happen with this series now, all I know is I'm not interested in what comes next tho. Just my opinion.
I only liked 1,4,5. Perfect trilogy. Don't need anything else.
They call it a keystroke
i swear to god i was ready for the kid to come out at the end of the movie driving a tank or some shit to save everyone...
My order so far 5, 1, 6, 2, 3, 7, 8, 4
The only movie from this franchise that I ever watched was Fast 5. And I thought it was a pretty decent but forgettable comedy. I couldn't take a single scene seriously. So no. I'll sit this one out as well.
The franchise shoulda stopped after the first
Everything Chris said here is how I pretty much felt about the new mission impossible
The F9 joke at the beginning got me haha
no space yet? damn it. i was really hoping for one...   edit: o, shit! they did? really? haha, stupid.
Thumbnail tales everything
The Best One of this frachise es the 3rd (Tokyo Drift).
The franchise should have ended when Paul Walker passed away. FF7 should have been the end. That's it. That is when it ended for me.
Is there ever an explanation for how all of a sudden in the NINTH film, Dom has a brother that has never been mentioned in the previous 8 films?
It’s always fun to guess the review by looking at Stuckmann’s face in the thumbnail.
I hope they finally bury the dead horse after this film and stop dragging it around....
Machete  needs to cross over to fast and furuous
Luke Cage = Ven Deisel
It's mission impossible action comedy long time ago
They need to STOP
"Because family."
they should add a tone of logan to fast and furious . i can direct this. really rough draft:  part of the crew gets killed by a new mafia of racers. and this is around 15 years after all these events. they dont have any more ties. just them alone becuase they supposely had their records clean and want to stay that way. since its a vengeance type of movie.
Time travel. Yup, that's the next theme and it'll explain why they're so lucky and why han is always back.
It helps to just accept that the main characters of gods and their cars and vehicles are a method of worships. It also helps to think that the cars are alive ini some mystical car/human connection.  If you just accept that, it works lol. Each movie, every character has gotten stronger, at some point - it reaches god level LOL
This franchise is needs to end seriously f9is super trash now they're super heroes
name me 10 Vin Diesel movies.
You know shit is mental when Chris swears.
At this point you had to have accepted the absurdity so its no big deal
Uhhhhh Chris, this has been a cartoon since about the third movie
This worries me, I kinda disliked Hobbs and shaw because it seemed like they finally figured out that it's not that serious and so it was all jokes and everything was just too much. So hearing that carried over into the main line is a real bummer. I'll still go see it but sigh
Very nice choice of shirt you've got there, Chris. How was the Dominion preview beforehand?
How did the Fast and Furious franchise go from realistic street racing to science-fiction car-related espionage with unrealistic physics?
“Look I have the tire collection *laughter*” One of my favorite moments of Chris’s reviews in a long time
You can’t put a rating on family
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
You’ve been watching the whole series wrong if you want it to be realistic. You watch it as a live anime show where Dom is the ultimate anime hero who keeps getting more powerful and is never in real danger and can always pull off the most insane things
Stop talking shit about the movie it’s really good I haven’t seen it yet so stop talking bad about it
😂😂😂
one thing that really baffled me through out the film, is that who is jacob(jakob)? its like dom was talking to himself the whole time
F10 gonna include transformers for Sure
I think the next step is to merge the FF series with The Transformers! Then all the cars they drive around in can change into robots
How did you get footage of this movie before it is released officially online and only in theaters?
last time I watched this franchise it was a need for speed knockoff.
F10: Brian returns as a hologram
We're at the point where I literally don't know what to expect from F&F 10.
I always love how Chris just cuts halfway through his laughs.
F9… it’s just called F9? Where is the excellent writing?!?!?!
Its ended when brian drove off with the wiz song. Everything after is fan fic cash grabs.
Falcon "you need to he better F9"
Tire collection, you say??  *strokes chin*
🤣🤣
Chris did you even watch the movie??? Who’s babysitting Bryan? Bryan Paul walker is babysitting they say it in the movie. SMH Please stop hating in your reviews.
To me the franchise lost all its emotional weight after 7. All of them since have been so middling and way too silly for their own good. Yeah the ones before certainly had their silly moments but there seemed to be more to care about and it felt like in 5-7 things were flowing at a more organic pace. But now it feels like they're just tossing shit at the wall and seeing whatever sticks.
Next movie Omni man invades lol
Kevin Feige will be incorporated into the Back to the future, I can see.
This weirdly got me more excited
Fast and furious: Infinite Parody Warfamily
Should've been a hilariocity
This one's based on a true story! 😉
Best part of the movie was the teaser for jurassic world dominion Epic shirt
I think this franchise is a never ending cash cow that you can milk every single year without risk of bombing at the box office. please stop supporting the people that makes this kind of movies.  we already killed the transformers, i think we can kill the fnf franchise too.
Rocket League spoiled the space car for me lol
Just watched the first three. Thank heavens I never invested in this franchise.
The next one should be called Fast10: Your Seatbelts
Must have been cheap concrete
They should drive so fast that they go back and forward through time
This film was the most pants thing I have ever seen
Ay Chris that’s a fire shirt. Where’d you get that at? I wanna get it 😂😂
To be honest the FF franchise is about the closest hollywood gets to the abaolute absurdity of Bollywood action films.
Hey Chris I want your room tour video. Lets have it
Also don't forget, John Cena is a coward
They should’ve kept Jason Statham as the villain. He was easily the best part of 7.
I hate this dude's reviews
Hobbs and Shaw are babysitting Bryan
Is it true that you put out a tweet you liked Annabelle just because the studio invited you to a early watching? Because that movie sucked and I just watched it because you saying it's decent. Well it's not.
These movies jumped the shark right after the first movie. They were always comedies. Didn’t you know? Lol
What happens to directors? Justin Lin made the great indie "Better Luck Tomorrow" and then graduated to making formulaic Hollywood nonsense.
I’m waiting for the final Fast and the Furious where they reveal this was all a simulation and that’s why all the stunts were possible
The next movie will be called Fas10 Your Seatbelt
It started off as street racing then became insane with bank robberys spys etc
when a movie is so bad you have to make up words to describe it. "Hilariocity"
Will they finish at f12? That's when my Keyboard stops!
8:00 More like a stroke it seems.
I'm waiting for my Transformers and Fast and Furious crossover  Or maybe even "Back to the Future"
The F9 Button at the beginning XD
Cypher did not inlist Jacob's help.. did you even watch the movie?
I knew this was going to happen. They were going to push reality and push reality until they went too far. Every successive movie DOES’NT HAVE TO BE MORE OUTLANDISH than the last one! Keep it simple! Keep it down to earth!
They say in the movie that Baby Brian was with Brian.
God-lee! They are on 9? I remember seeing 8. I still haven’t seen Hobbs and Shaw, and now 9?! You know when key individuals leave it’s going to change a bit.
Just wait till Fast and furious gets ditected by Michael Bay
S’up Chris? Gonna review RE8 eventually?
These movies are soooooooooo bad! 🥴I like the Tokyo drift though 🙈
It's bad. They have super power now.
I’m just starting the video but I assume it’s about family
Chirs review loki episode 1 2 far better than whole f9 tom Hiddleston stole the show 💪💪💪
This series has now become a live action version of the McBain movies from the Simpsons!
HAHAHAA I love when Chris makes a review like this!!!! Made my day!!!
Cheap action
Fast 10 should read "NO  *FX*  GIVEN" 🤣🤣🤣
They lost you Chris, because I think unlike every previous entry this time around they were in on the joke which kind of ruins the fun when they go too far in one direction 🤷‍♂️
They cant call it FX. That movie already exists. And was amazing.
Anyone else miss when the series was about street racing and gangsters, and crashing your car had consequences?
I wish they would go back to basics street racing real car stunts instead of the crap cgi they have plus anything with John cena is a fail
I think I'll stick with The Fast and the Furious 1-7. These movies clearly peaked with Fast Five, F6 was ok. I didn't really get into the Letty fight with Gina Carano. I was impressed with the Vin Diesel and Johnson fight, that was impressive. These movies always had a sense of realism that made you wonder if it was even possible. After being in 2 car accidents I can tell you right now, Letty should have been dead. F7 is where things started to get a little ridiculous Dom getting hit in the head by a piece of metal by Decker Shaw, which should've knocked him out. There is no way you can tell me that a person would be able to survive a strike in the head by a heavy wrench and be able to get back up let alone keep fighting. I never understood why Dom was ok with Decker at the end of the movie of F8 when he gave Dom his son when Decker was the one who blew up his house and they're cool with each other. Dom didn't even bother to have his house rebuilt and you see the characters at a different house, which makes Fast and Furious 6 weak. The team goes through all that effort to catching Decker's brother and saving the day to just living somewhere else. Fast and Furious 8 was 'ok whatever'. I was never quite convinced that Charlize Theron's character was that smart at hacking into a Russian Sub. I thought the Hobbs was neutered in this film. He was kind of neutered in the last two films as being the tough guy to being a mediocre character. In Fast Five, he was a force to be reckoned with and intimidating. You look at Brian who talked about Hobbs and even the tone in his voice showed that Hobbs was the end of the line for criminals. Then you find out he has a daughter and he's a coach for a soccer team, I thought it really cheapened his character from a possible meat grinder to now a puppy.
Bryan was taking care of Bryan while they were away they mentioned that
Charlize's Simple Jack haircut is the best thing about this movie 🤣
i know what the next 3 movies will be called.
I just LOVE how we always get a clue what Chris thought of the movie just by the thumbnail 😂😂😂
Oh, so *this* is finally the one that loses Stuckmann for teetering too far into parody?!  We gotta blind man watching pretending to watch movies on this channel, folks... 🤡
F9 adventures in space. I ain’t got friends! I got family! Grrrr
lol im never gonna watch this give me the spoilers
Fast Furious= Saints Row
I love it, superhero with cars …. Very good
Honestly i could care less. FnF3 is where the buck stopped 😕.
Fast and Furious doesn't need logic. It has family.
My sister has seen up to the 4th movie. She responds "how are they superheroes?"
The worst film franchise of all time.
Alr idk why you guys are complaining? After fast 4 we kinda embraced it wasn’t about fast cars and girls. Its entertaining and that’s why we watch them. They aren’t good movies anymore but they are entertaining and something I like to watch every year
2 videos in 24 hours that's impressive Chris. And please Do "silence of the lamb " on Halloween
You just now started to see this franchise as absurd? The tank chasing sports cars on ice didn't do that for you?
I loved Hobbs and shaw, I've never seen any of the other films. I guess I'll try out the fifth film, since you said it was the best.
In the heights review?
A borderline hilaritrocity review lol
Maybe put 100 ads more?
"Who's babysitting Brian?" <- and thus was the plot of the next Fastverse spinoff movie born
best part of the movie was the JW3 preview
What are we some kinda F9: Fast Saga?
"... I couldn't really believe anything that was happening." Now!... You couldn't believe, until NOW!? That IS hilarious! These movies are basically Marvel-like, superhero movies now.
hey hey hey dont disrespect this movie. John Cena denied the existence of an entire country so this movie could be seen!
Title- FX Tagline- this time F is for Family
Dom in FF 1-9: “Family is everything” Dom’s bro: “Am I a joke to you?”
Can't wait until they run out of numbers and start using letters.  F:U anyone?
why were cars driving themselves in the movie!?
"LAUGHABLE" - CHRIS STUCKMANN
We want a hiliarocity review of F9!!! Jajajajajajajaja
I fail to see what the problem is when these films have been ridiculous since Fast Five. Vin Diesel was always invincible and the audience had been okay with that for every movie of this franchise he was the lead.
2:35, they do explain it actually. Brian is babysitting Bryan.
"So, Fast 9..." *long silence*
It's a bad anime movie, but with real people.   *Tis but a flesh wound!*
Are we just gonna gloss over that hilarious "F9" joke at the start?
They should call the next one Xtinction. In this one Aliens invade and they have to be killed with cars.
When Chris’s review is reduced to saying “And  this happened, then this happened” while chuckling, you know it’s close to hilariocity. 😄
Haha I have always said they are comedies, and great ones at that!
I watched the 8th one and I clocked out as soon as the car came out of the ice. I'm glad Tyrese is earning his paychecks, but these movies are about street racing. What went wrong here?
Imagine, just imagine still watching these movies. Especially with john "China simp" cena
They lost me with 8 the rock throwing a missile and Tyrese going underwater in Antarctica holding onto a car door and Jason Statham fighting with a baby in a car seat in one hand
Oof
No, Chris. The next Fast and Furious movie will be called Fast 10: Your Seatbelts.
They broke all physics in the last 3 films, and went full Sci-fi in Hobbs and Shaw
I wish this franchise goes full clown-fiesta and ends up with Vin Diesel driving a fucking international space station. Literally drifting through space.
*Dom dies* *Dom immediately comes back to life* 'Family is more powerful than death'
Oh man, I just realized that they’re slowly turning the absurdity knob up to 11....🤔
This is the great energy I love seeing in your reviews. So refreshing
I don’t know, I am actually all for the series going full cartoon. Escalation baby!
Trash
Now this just made star wars better after all bcuz F9 just upped the dumb ante 2 the next level hahahaha
They have been catching people with cars for the last 4 movies.  And I'm still in.  FX to the MOOOOOON.
Spoilers no spoilers?
Its obvious that they took the super soldier serum. So it makes sense. 😂
No in the Heights review? Is the only movie with Latin leads in it 😂 who knows when we’ll have another one!
This sounds awful. I have to see it.
i stopped watching after tokyo drift  proud to say i havent seen any of them after the 3rd💪
FAST FIVE ALWAYS gets a pass because those were REAL Chargers pulling a REAL bank vault through the streets.   Of course there was some behind the scenes magic going on with a pickup truck and a few other things but for the most part those action scenes were shot in camera.   Don't know about the rest of them. Somebody needs to die to keep the stakes grounded in some sort of reality.
Alrighty, without having seen it, here's my theory: They pull a "Repo Man" in Fast 10. Fast 2 to 9 are just a simulation or a dream, they managed to play for Vin Diesel because he actually crashed into the train at the end of The Fast and the Furious and is in Coma from that point on. Nothing else happened.
From the first to fifth it's all good and fun (with exceptions of Tokyo drift's lead actor was beyond miscast, and the nitro's use in second one).
“ It is 100% a cartoon. “ 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀   It’s a SNL Parody 😂😂😂😂😂
Cant really be much worse than the last One where they remotely Control thousands of cars... Some of them from the 90's... That felt like an insult to my brain
FX
I dont even remember why Han was in F9.
I’m over these shits 🙄🙄🙄
They gotta do ‘Fast & Fur10us’ next
TOO BAD MACHETE KILLS IN SPACE DIDN'T GET MADE
Fuck F9
The fact that this movie is so over the top ridiculous now that even Chris couldn't keep a straight face 3 times, that speaks volumes about the insanity that is this franchise now.
'something something family'.
F9 was so good. It's Gold fun and high octane action. The fights between Dom and Jakob......😱! The vehicle warfare.........😱! The other hand to hand fight scenes.......😱! Just watch the film for what it is.
Gta V: The Movie
He needs to go back to the success he found in fast five. That was my favorite film out of the series.
After they go to Space.... Like literally what could possibly happen...I'm excited for what they would do for the final one F11 they might just fight Satan in Hell... And challenge him for a Street race...
This franchise took the 22 Jump Street credits sequence and ran with it.
Ummm... after the first movie I realized this series is a comedy - i've still watched every one.
F15: the crew goes too fast and too furious and ends up going back in time to the first movie, where the events of the old movies are put in a different perspective, and their actions create a multiverse that leads to multiple Disney shows
It should've stopped at 7. 7 was the best one. And it was the last one with Paul Walker.
Chris is too soft on movies right now. If u hate it just say so!!
FX would be a cool title, but nothing beats “FAST 10 Your Seatbelts”
I saw Fast 1 and 5 and that’s enough for me. This does seem like a fun popcorn series though just for some dumb fun
The mixtape for the soundtrack came out like a year ago
Anyone else genuinely disappointed that this is what the franchise has become. Fast five is a legitimately food movie and now we have this
Its called KARMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PASS
Fast and Spacious
When is the Michael Bay Transformers + Fast and Furious crossover?  Anything with Cena is a joke :P
nah next film is gonna be absolutely crazy like- this shit's either gonna go to space, have aliens, or ghosts n shit- fuck this shit i'm out lmao
"Who's babysitting Bryan?" uhmm a babysitter? who cares
Only Good Thing is The YODA joke!!!
Wow,
Not trying to defend this one but the complaint you had about the kid being left behind is not true. The movie says they left him with Paul Walker's character, who is still alive in this universe
F10: Alien fucking Abduction
I think its funny the whole franchise is about family but we are barely finding out Dom has a brother lol
Fast and Furious avengers? No need to watch this one.... they should bring back Brian.... oh wait.....
There are 9 of these things now? I enjoyed the 1st one.  It was already over the top and absurd. They didn't need to get more so. But when they did, they lost me.
Does anyone else see Optimus Prime's head at the Jurassic Park gate on Chris' shirt?
Next movie: Fast 10: Your Seatbelts.
1, 5, & 7 were my favorites. 2 & Tokyo Drift were pretty good as well. I didn't like the others and after 8 sucked, I had no intention of seeing this one.
This movie will make my AMC stock jump up. I have never expected anything but great stunts from this franchise.
the reason y i say the fights were short because he came to the realization that he needs to save him and not kill him
This sounds like everything I wanted
Once they jumped the sub there was no where else to go but up
what's next mars?
I don't like when they started changing the name to Fast 9 or Furious 9 or something like that. Now it's just F9. The next movie is just called "10"?? Why not keep "The Fast & Furious 9"? 9 characters who are fast and furious. That makes sense to me.
Your choice of shirt says it all regarding your favorite part of the movie.
I'm more surprised that Chris still felt like up to now the Fast franchise still had a sense of realism. I mean come on they have had countless high-speed car crashes where everyone walked away without a scratch. They have fallen out of multiple storey buildings with nothing to protect them they have had cars roll down mountains. I feel like they lost any sense of realism after like 5. Even 5 was pushing it
Double upload in one day!!! OH MY GOD!! we are witnessing miracle peeps!
My man Chris was REALLY generous to the movie and this film franchise. I’ve ONLY seen the first two & could never make it past the first couple of minutes of Tokyo Drift! …But that said, for some reason, I do wanna watch the CGI Netflix cartoon!😄
fast and furious should have ended with 7.   it had a genuinely touching ending about paul walker and it pushed the ante just enough (the grenade toss into the helicopter, and garage stomp were the highlights of ridiculousness).   I think if it ended there people would really have respected the franchise having gone from cheesy cult B movie, to actually v impressive action movies from 5 onwards and be remembered fondly by all rather than just a dead horse.
I will literally only watch this for Finn Cole, even if he’s probably in this for like ten minutes
Tbh these movies jumped the shark awhile ago im here for the ride no matter how dumb 😂
What this franchise needs is health bars for every character.
I just want a Jurassic World and Fast  and Furious crossover. 🤣
I like the reviews but pleeeease Chris STOP trying to act!
F5 to F7 is the only good trilogy. F1 to F3 is trash in my opinion, F4 began to showcase Justin Lin's talent as an action director and F8 completely lost me, I think Paul Walker was an essential character to this franchise, and without him is simply not the same.
F-X (get it!?).. starting Tugg Speedman
These movies are garbage.
Here's another one. I like to speculate about this franchise having different directors or studios.  Here's my pitch for the Hallmark channel " Christmas on the Lamb, a fast n furious movie" Jason Statham is on a prison transfer bus that gets in an accident . He breaks out with a female prisoner , played by Lori Loughlin.  They're on the run and hiding in Montana at the Torretto bed and breakfast, that has Way the hell too much Christmas decor up. Wackiness ensues and Lori's character discovers that being able to escape law enforcement and post wall romance is possible , because of family.
I haven't enjoyed a  fast'n'furious movie since 7. 8 was just way too over the top and hobbs and shaw was literally unwatchable crap
This movie flew too close to the sun.
The next one should be something like FX, just like a generic, over the top name because family. Just found chris said FX 😂
We watch them at home and my son screams "Fambly" every time Diesel says it.  It makes the movies interesting but Diesel has a speech impediment for sure.  I think we stopped watching them at number 7.
Chris, please. Every Fast and Furious film is a Hiliarocity. Doesn't mean I like them any less.
Look man at this point FF movies are just movies I would never pay to watch but if they come on TV and I'm home, I'm whipping out the bong and a beer and enjoying the show lol and for me personally I like to have a couple guilty pleasures like that.
No,the next one should be Fxxx, the showdown of dom vs. Xander cage,boom it writes itself and the future of fast and xxx are starting a new connected universe......easy
Part 11 all the characters vs zombies.
1,3,5,6 and 7.
Chris🥴you have me in my house literally laughing the fck out loud 😂😂
F6 = “This Moment, We Own It” F7 = “When I See You Again” F9 = ....................
In the first movie they ran a run down joint that sold tuna sandwiches... XD
That image of the F9 key at the beginning 😂😂😂
That giggling of chris after "the tire collection" LOL
I won't be surprised if they make someday a Fast & the Furious & Monster Hunter crossover flick.
For me, the "main saga" should have ended with Furious 7. You had your big emotional farewell with Brian, you had your montage... Leave it be.   Go into side stories like "Hobbs and Shaw". Which was ton of fun, despite its flaws. But let the main movies die-out. Because the first worrying symptoms were there for The Fate of the Furious. Which felt both exploitative and like the people behind the camera are starting to run out of interesting ideas.
Han shud of stayed dead 💀
I don't even attempt to watch action movies anymore. They're all made for Chinese audiences now and Chinese audiences like stupid stuff. People that aren't allowed to think like mindless entertainment.
Jacob was not even foreshadowed through any of the movies.
First 3 seconds in and you already made me laugh lol this video is already made my day.
tbh this is just me i enjoyed the movie but not the flashbacks and visions. i think they could’ve wrapped that up in the beginning. i also think that roman(tyrese) was making fun of the movie the whole damn time with talking about them being invincible. you also pointed out how dom broke the top of the door and nothing happened and how the guy’s body just went through the billboard with nothing happening. i think the movie could’ve been better but i enjoyed it for what it’s worth. i guess because i just love this franchise no matter what they do
Ha!! He has the EN-TIRE! Collection 😂
O.o.....Time traveling will be the next journey for them.
You have to be mentally ready for Christopher Nolan movies. You also have to be MENTALLY READY for FnF movies these days.
"F:X" I really like the title 😂
They should go for Fast 11 skipping Fast 10. That would make them like iPhone.
Fast-ten your seatbelts?
If John cena Wass the brother of Paulwalker  it would be Believable
INVINCIBLE
I think the writer and Justin Lin saw the memes and said "That shit funny, lets make a movie"
They actually are superheros.  The whole justice league
Fx??? Should be called fasTEN your seatbelts
Wait, all the previous movies weren't parodies? Damn, my bad.
Dom's son brian was at home stealing a car getting in a fight, joining an underground race, running from the police Fast 10 coming out next summer
Fast and Furious 15!  Space Cars!!!
It's action packed, but you revive Han is just not good, at my point of view.
I loved F5 too! Physics kinda packed her laws and left when she saw the script, but I haven't missed her since.   My favorite moment so far was Hobbs breaking his cast by flexing his arm. In my headcanon he just _dared_ his bones to stay broken and they fused back out of sheer terror.
4:05 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Let me guess, Cena joins forces with the team and goes “family comes first”
Remember when this series was just about street racing?
You would think they would go back to an actual story like the first one, or even Tokyo Drift, the rest are all just terrible.
Has Star Wars thought you nothing!? No ones ever really dead..
The next one will be fast10 your seatbelts
Who needs Physics and Good Writing if you have Family.
The car watched Bryan.
Hilariously the vault pulling was actually a practical effect. But it was such a ridiculous a difficult stunt that anything they're gonna do to top that had to be CG. And now we're in a world where that effect has gone too far it seems
F9?....      F.U. ill pass
They're superheroes except their powers are based on cars.  As long as they are touching a car, they have access to their superpowers.  That's why if they fall on the ground they will die, but if they fall on a car they're fine and defy physics
jacob : think dom think  you'll outlast every insignificant being on this plant
Should be called F-This for the next movie. For obvious reasons.
Fast and furious 10: Dom discover his father was from viltrom
One thing Chris proves with his latest videos is that if you’re desperate to break into the industry and want to kiss so much ass, you can’t seriously review movies without coming across as a weak kiss ass guy.
It's somewhat entertaining I'm not exactly a fast and furious fan it won't be my favorite
Absolutely agree with you on this.  By far one the worst Fast movies.
Just turn your brain off and enjoy lol
Hilariousity review this PLEASE
"This movie will entertain a lot of people.  Especially if you go into it thinking it's a comedy"  Wait...people watch these movies without that mindset?!
this was way too much
Ya but the French cut is WAYYY BETTER! They get EVERYTHING over there. Full frontal!
Vin Diesel literally gets shot in one of the movies and then beats the dude up like nothing happened lol They have been parody’s for so long now and I really can’t wait to see the new one. Like I would rather see a super stupid movie where the protagonist are superheros fighting nuclear submarines with Lamborghinis than anything that came before Fast 5
I laughed the moment I watched the trailer. As expected of course.
Chris, that shirt you have is possibly the greatest shirt ever made.
2:45 are you being funny or serious. because mia clearly said the kids are with brian
The next one should be called "Intermittent FASTing".
The movie is almost as bad as charlize therons new hairstyle
wtf is this? I saw the first one when I was a kid, and I remember a semi-serious Infernal Affairs type movie with street races?
Superheroes? Imagine if Nick Fury turned up in a end credits scene of Fast 10!!!!
I hate the fast series I dunno how people can sit and watch this shit
I thought 6 was the worst, a lot of people seem to like it.
Chris hates this film
Aw man it's the opposite for me, these have gotten so old because I thought the writing took itself too seriously, and the flashy action wasn't really enough for me to watch a movie that I thought was walking the line of not being quite bad enough to be funny. I'm watching the shit out of this. If this is the direction they're going, they might have a new fan. For the wrong reason mind you, but a new fan nonetheless.
It’s official. This is a Hilariocity!
Some people enjoy the series now, but I really wish they’d ended it after Paul died.
They’re all bs aside from the first one.
FAMILY.
I mean, they're trash movies, so Idk what you expected
Bruh, when you gonna do 'In the Heights'???
fast and furious X Home Alone: Brian’s tale
I am 1000% seeing this movie stoned. For family.
Chris : Says Fu**ing Cap. American : Language
This movie just looks hilarious to me! lol
I want Fast And Furious 10 to be called FAST AND FUR10US, FasTEN your seatbelts
but i do think the bank vault scene in F5 was practical so it’s not that absurd compared to everything else in the series
I’m so tired of this franchise getting shitted on when it’s 400 times better than that synder cut bullshit. At least these movies try to entertain you and make you laugh and smile , can’t say the same for a lot of shit that comes out these days , also “fast 10 your seatbelts” isn’t funny , and has never been funny.
I get what ur saying but there’s no way this is the one that went too far when The Rock literally holds back a helicopter with his bare hands lol
Caring about not talking about spoilers of fast and furious movies.....who cares ??
Borderline hilariocity? IM SOLD
You should do a review on flight it stars Denzel Washington good movie
fiero'd in space should be new jumped the shark
F10: Endgame
C-?
0:04 .......... _🇱 🇴 🇱_
You mean the Fast movies haven’t been Hilariocities for the last 4 movies at least? OAO  Also I thought we all agreed that physics and logic don’t exist in the Furiousverse. 🤣
The best one was Tokyo Drift
Yeah, might have seen it if John CCPna hadn't pulled that stunt.....
I hope you wear that bracelet more than just this month
I’m going with Fast and Furious: The last Lap, for the final one.
His face when he said cars are catching humans from falls was fucking hilarious lol
FX is going to be where they found out they're mutants and that the only reason they haven't died is because they're super soldiers, then it's revealed the government set it all up which leads to a collab with the bad guys in order to escape once and for all
Hot garbage since the first movie.
They lost you on this one Chris? I was lost 7 movies ago. If I have to hear Vin Diesel say “family” one more time I might completely lose it.
Remember when the craziest thing in a FF movie was jumping a muscle car onto a boat? Yeah. I miss the original movies which were actually based on Earth.
F10: Doms dad is Arnold Schwarzenegger
FF10: Space race.
I really like the F&F series but, they just keep pushing it.
I mean all these movies after 2 have been ridiculous not like we take them serious lol
Yeah....I stopped at the last good one which was the second one.
hahaha
a keystroke. brilliant lol.
Chris I love you man, but this is not exactly new, the series has always been a dumb cartoon I don't know, maybe I'm a bit biased but I really don't like any of them😂
The last film i liked from this franchise was fast 5. By far my favorites are the first 3 movies, when they used to race.
@chris, please review conjuring latest part
JURASSIC T SHIRT INSTANT LIKE!!!
Dom doesn't feel pain unless......      It's for FaMILy
2:30 Brian was with Brian the whole time I guess?
I stopped watching Fast and Furious after Paul Walker’s death, F7 was the last one I watched and I don’t think I’m gonna watch another ever again. Fast 5 remains my favorite
I wonder if the fast and furious universe will clash with the MCU in the next Doctor Strange movie :D.
Deserves another Emoji Movie inspired review
Shit... Vin Diesel is gonna be 54 years old in a few weeks... he might’ve been able to bounce off concrete 20 years ago but it’s harder to believe as time goes on lol
Fast and Furious is just an anime at this point.
The John Cena bend over really soured this movie for me.
It's a keystroke, lol...I am in for the wild ride. Space, nothing else remains now? moon or mars or goodness, they may push it further.
EN EL AIRE WEON, EN EL AIRE WEON. 1:15
I can never get into these movies, when every character can walk away from the most insane, ludicrous, stuff without a scratch it just makes the movie lose all tension. Even for a "turn your brain off" kind of series that this is I cannot physically or mentally turn my brain off enough to enjoy this franchise. None of the actors are charismatic enough, none of the characters mean anything if all of them can live through a quarter of a mile tumble down a mountain and walk away without a sore shoulder, and the situations keep one upping the last one to insane degrees that my brain rejects on pure instinct alone.  I can enjoy stupid movies, I unironically like Wild Wild West, but there are much better action movies out there than this franchise by leagues.
Watch and review “Solomon Kane” 2009
I totally didn't know these movies were still coming out....😶
????? It's been that way since part 1....exception of 3.
Spoilers        They said where young Brian was. He was with big Brian and his kids.
Fast 10 your seatbelts
I feel like Chris sold me on this movie more.
*seeing Chris's face in the thumbnail  "Oh this review is going to be good" 😆
I can't wait to watch this movie now!
i was entertained. ps. wasn't the kid with Brian?
Enough games, give me the Transformers crossover.
FnF: Hey South Indian movies can I copy your physics homework? South Indian Movies: Sure, just change it a little FnF: Okay then...
FX: Cars on Mars
I haven’t watched the last 2-3.
Hobbs and Shaw was the best one. Mostly because Vin & the main crew isn’t in it.
These movies need to stop.
I'll say, I never really got into this franchise but if you're going to say it's the kind of movie you like to just sit back and eat popcorn and not question everything, then I would say sit back,eat ur popcorn and NOT question everything lol and you might not have problems. But I'm sure if u start thinking about it the whole movie is a conundrum
Amazed he was actually “invested” in these movies before this one. Seven maybe but only because of the Walker stuff but really these movies have been getting progressively stupider since 5 and the fact that Vin Diesel takes them seriously is what makes them fun.
and this is a cannes' official selection this year
Bring back the Street Racing
I find these movies really boring. It shouldn’t be because there’s so much action but I just get bored.
They should seriously do a transformers and fast and furious crossover.
You make it to the 9th one of these before reaching the conclusion that it's ridiculous shit? LOL! News flash, ALL OF THESE MOVIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETE SHIT. The fact that 9 of these have been made is probably a sign of the impending Apocalypse. I can envision a demon turning to Satan and saying, "It is done master." "The ninth F&F movie has been made." "This is the long awaited sign that the collective IQ of the human race has reached the lowest possible level". "Time to open the hell gates and start the invasion".
The amount you laughed, sound like a fun movie to me :)
John Cena sold out to China...can't watch it.
In conclusion, the movie is just F9
Lil Brian was being looked after by Big Brian btw
F9:Looney Tunes
You miss the point, Chris. FX will reveal they’re all X-men! This whole franchise has been an origin story! LOL And now that I’ve said that, they’ll actually go with it ^^”
Hilariosity?
One day the F&F franchise will join the MCU. Dom will collect the infinite stones to revive Brian and in the process, they'll become the Fantastic Four
Now that the line has been crossed they should just go full Dragonball Z. Have Don charge up his muscles with the power of family and become anime Jesus.
They mention in the movie that Brian (kid) is in safe hands with (Paul walker) Brian.
I dont know what series you've been watching chris these havent been remotely believable. The last movie had the rock holding down a helicopter with his hand, fought a superhuman cyborg with an army of Hawaiian warriors wielding antique Hawaiian weapons. There is no change here.
Doms son should be called Paul
bruh STILL no In The Heights?
This sounds like a great movie to have a few beers with
It's not not entertaining at least, it's just that we got tired of it lol
I hate that Han is alive again? and Michelle Rodriguez? they were better off dead ! are they gonna bring back Vince I wonder who died in the 5th one? and its a bit weird that Doms kid is called Brian, like I get that its a tribute to Paul walker but technically the character is still alive in the films universe so is Dom in love with Brian ? is that something there going to explore further in F10 using cgi ?
1:48 Science Fiction should not be confused with Fantasy...and vice versa.
dude this sounds fucking hilarious
Hard to believe there are nine of these movies.  I remember when the first one came out and it was one of the first DVDs I ever bought.  But after three this franchise just got over the top silly and insane that I couldn’t take it serious anymore.
family
Next one, to MARS!
The story wasn’t really a story and the action was so unrealistic to the point I’m like Luda & tyrese in space Wtf 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
I am sorry but at some point you've got be able to tell a trully dumb movie for what it is, and tell people it's dumb, don't watch it, a better time is spent staring at the sun.  I know you want to be nice, but come on! I wance stop playing one of these movies at home because it was so dumb, it was actually giving me a headache. You are an actual critic right?
Can't wait for the "critical drinker" to  rip this apart
Fast 10 is where Torero realize the family his a state of mind and not random people.
If you took the movie franchise where The Rock jumps back into action by flexing away a medical brace in the hospital seriously, that's your problem.
Next one is definitely being called FasTen your seat belts
Remember when this movies was about a illegal car racing.
Ahhh so that’s why they delayed it lmao. They knew story wise it sucked so they needed the box office numbers to continue with the next movie😭
Boy I miss the days when F&F was just about cars and street racing.
Ryan George is gonna have a field day with this one...
Fingers crossed that F10 is a crossover with Friday The 13th.
these movies are trash, the first one was good and thats it. Theyre so shit, I dont care how much "mindless fun" you want to say about it, therye trash.
I can't put my finger on what this movie is missing..... *Michelle Rodriguez * "Cuban nos"
2 C-s in 12hrs....
2 fast 2 furious was my favorite. Followed by the 1st one. I know its only so much you can do with drag racing but the shit they been doing since Fast 5 is kinda ridiculous. Still gonna watch tho
It was already a cartoon before. Cars jumping from skyscrapers in Abu Dhabi? Come on.
I mean... there WAS a scene in one of the previous ones, don't ask me which, where two dudes fight with 2ft wrenches ... like, just bitchslapping one another. They lose not a single tooth. Professional boxers sustain brain injuries when getting hit like that with FISTS, but a 20-pound wrench? Naaw, dawg, not even a bruise.
😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆😆😆😆my God WTF!!!!!
Chris not being a car guy is already having a stroke from watching this, imagine what would happen if you’re a petrolhead.
Can anyone even remember the last time we got an A+ film?
Man, I was hoping for an Emoji Movie type review for this. 😒
What's the band in his hand?
So I see Brian’s wife, Dom’s sis is in this.  Do they explain why she is but Brian isn’t?
What is he talking about? These movies has been a parody for bout 4-5 movies now. Which movie was it when the Rock fell out a building a only broke his arm that then healed the next day? Was it the same one where Deisel and Stathum crash into each other’s speeding cars and then just get out to fist fight? I know that the same one where Deisel stomps his foot and brings a parking lot down and Letty just kisses him back to life. Sir this franchise is a circus, pure uncut fuckery everywhere, nothing new here at all.
All these reviews saying that it's too ridiculous only make me more excited for this movie. I want ridiculous from these movies. I want anime and I hope they will continue to push it with every following movie.
can the next one be "FX: A fistful of furious" ?
I have seen the 6:43 - 6:44 shot...i mean location before, in the Alex Rider new tv show, loll
I'm still watching it!!!!!!
Personally I don't care about how real it is just like you said these movies are mindless I honestly can't wait cause to me it looks dope
When they said "Fast & Furious in space" I imagined a road in space like Mario Kart
Come on Chris!😂 Do a hilariocity on F9.😂😂☠️☠️
This movie is fkn awsome!!!🔥❤️
The rest of the internet: "They have to called it Fast 10 your seatbelts" Chris: *"They have to call it FX"*
from Fast part 1 too 9 I always wonder when did the characters become martial arts experts ? like Letty ? WTF ?
The tenth movie is obviously gonna be a prequel for Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick
Looks like movie is riped for Hilariosity Chris...Do it...
Dave Bautista debut for the Fast Saga in F10  The wrestling family unite
F10: Robots in disguise F11: Back to the future F24: Wheelchair mayhem
Fast & Furious movies are like Resident Evil movies to me:  Absolutely hilarious comedies intercut with a healthy dose of action and WTF.
I will always wonder how these would’ve turn out if Paul was still alive. Maybe it would still be this ridiculous we’ll never know.
Next movie they will fight aliens with lightsabers in space cars.
Me and my brother  are watching this film on Friday.
You make it sounds like they finally jumped the shark?
Sooo... They jumped the planet?
Yeah, I've been where you are with the Fast and Furious franchise for a while now. What you describe as the perfect line between realism and absurdity is found in the Mission: Impossible franchise IMHO. I just don't feel grounded in the Fast movies at all.
F-X: Jurassic Parking Lot
is F10 gonna be on mars?
It's funny because everything this movie showed me in the trailer, made me not even care. It just looked dumb to me and that's saying something because I've watched them all.
I hope the writer use old macbook, where after f12, its the eject button
Can't wait for a spin off called alt F4
The first one is the only good one.  Can't remember which one but they had the world's longest runway.
Fast and furious will continue forever ♾️
Reminds me of saints row video games series
F9 is the failure grade in high schools in my country.
i gave up on this series after the 1st one.  even 2 was laughably bad, every iteration since that one just gets worse and worse.  i honestly wish this franchise would disappear.  fast.
F9 Ahahaha oh boy ....
F9 the fast saga lol
Woah two uploads in one day. Busy man.
I've heard that this movie is too ridiculous in multiple reviews so........ what the hell is in this????? I gotta see it now
2:14 "from falls...  which..."   lmao at the pause 😂
After the passing of Paul Walker the franchise should have stopped, it's become a joke....
New F series movie comes out   Physics : my time is over
Diesel has been trying to turn this franchise into James Bond ever since #4. The series peaked at #5 and had been on a fast downhill slide since then. I can't stand the excuse "turn your brain off and have fun". Why? I like my brain. I like using it. It's an insult to be asked not to use it for the sake of staring at flashy images on a movie screen. For years the only thing these movies have been good for is a drinking game. Get a bunch of friends together, and everyone has a shot every time someone in the movie says "family".
I watched the movie a few days ago not gonna lie but the car scenes were horrible and the action just felt like I was watching a boot leg version of star wars like Jesus man like I get the unrealistic scenes in movies but in fast 9 they took it way too far like they even went to space
Going from the first movie to this one is like night & day
I don’t like John Cena in movies so I knew I would feel different about this movie compared to the others
It really upsets me to see one of my favorite franchises that I grew up with just devolve into complete absurdity. And somehow the dumber and more cartoonish the movies get, the more money they make.
Boycotting this crap cuz of John Cena but let's see what the review says
You can't give a movie nine Fs just because its called F9, Chris.
F&F X Transformers   I’m calling it.
I liked the first one. The rest...looney tunes
The next one HAS TO BE called “ FAST-TEN YOUR SEATBELT”
Fast & The Furious 10: Enter Bautista. ... And Aliens.
Fast and Furious gets 11 movies and Back to the Future only get 3:(
Was is really that difficult to just leave one of the characters dead? Do they even know how to spell the word “stakes”?
Why is Mia back? I don’t have anything against the character, but there was literally no reason for her to return after F7. Unless Jacob killed Brian off-screen
They basically turned into the Avengers.
C- Sounds Generous.
They’re the Justice League at this point
Time to find out it's as bad as any 9th movie in a saga ever was.
“I have the TIRE collection 👈🏽👈🏽” - Chris
If they’re planning on stopping at 11, they need to call 10 “fast and furious X” and 11 “the last furious”
Tokyo Drift will always be the best, more focused one.
I don't why but Chris giggling and smiling gives me the warm and fuzzies.........good review
Love how we know what we are in for just from your video thumbnail- thank you
They need to do one where the team travel to an alternate dimension and go up against evil versions of themselves. Evil Dom is like: I don't need family, I got friends. Then they're taught the importance of FAMILY
Fast and Furious X coming next, which will include a crossover with scorpion and subzero
FX: Back to the Future with Family
The kids were with Brian (Paul Walker).They mention that very clearly.
As I have an IQ over 60, so no....I don't watch these, Gal Gadot my be the only thing that might make it worth watching
I am a fan of the fast and furious movies but of course some I’ll only watch once or twice because they aren’t as good. I’ll still watch this franchise until I’m no longer entertained
Oh no, you don't have to use sense to see this movie. If you can't disconnect your common sense, you're gonna have a bad time...
Does anyone else know about Vin Diesel’s belief that The Fast and the Furious movies should win oscars?  Also what if you just see the movie in IMAX for the new Jurassic World Trailer?
this franchise is a video game at this point.   the characters can't die or will magically spawn back to life.   maybe with F10, Gal Gadot will come back as well. who knows?! lol 😂
I don’t agree with you you love the fast movies and got the collection but you hating on fast 9 you hating on little detail ok whatever get over it 😡
I think FX is the perfect title for the next one.
FAMILY
"They call it a key stroke" Well there's a completely random thought that i'll never get off my mind now.
the fast series lost me a loooooong time ago tbh. I'm just along the ride for John Cena this time. It does sound like the movies are the new Sharknado series
Holding out for CapsLock.
Clear example of be careful what you wish for
I've only seen F5 and F9, so I had a great time. Had no idea who anyone was, but I didn't care at all. The action was legitimately great, and it was pretty funny too.
Welp…only one more to go.
Honestly, I felt the same way watching John Wick 3
Still not about Cars an street racing I'm good
Up until recently I had only ever see the first three films and that was in their time. It always baffled me when I’d see new trailers and now F&F is like Mission:Impossible. Like, what happened to the SoCal street racing scene? Then I binged 4-8 recently, and they sorta made sense, but, man are they silly, especially the latter films. But I still enjoyed them as mindless entertainment and I will see F9 in the theater!
Next movie: FX!! "Because we know what the fuck we are doing!!!" 😆😆😆
Since when does Dom have a fucking brother? This shit just gets dumber and dumber and Chris has been on a roll recommending HOT GARBAGE lately.
Seeing people enjoying these movies is just mindblowing to me, loll i just can't do the same. that Theron hairstlye looks like Yelena from AOT, very nice, she looks great.
Fas10 Your Seatbelts
That thumbnail face is hilarious.
Still thought it should’ve ended at Furious 7
Hard to believe this has a 64% on RT right now considering it's supposed to be the worst in the series.
Idk man It's been dumb since Tokyo Drift. 5 was ok and the rest are ridiculous
These movies are literal dog shit
If John cena is in it, it’s guaranteed garbage.
You would absolutely love the live-action Rurouni Kenshin movies. They're actually really good adaptations. Netflix recently released all of the first three along with their new exclusive final fourth film based on the Trust and Betrayal story
Yeah, this series hit that unbelievable level for me back at 5 I think, it just went absolutely cartoon'ish and so unbelievable that I couldn't watch it any more. I just know at some point they are going to have a box Nova that is able to be launched into space or something. It's just offensively ridiculous.
So to sum the review up…it’s a fast and furious movie…yeah
Finally Hollywood has reached to the level of Bollywood
It’s the ‘John Cena’ effect.
I expected ludicrous and got ludicrous
Wow you nice by giving this C- , Me I give this shit F+ hot garbage.
Yes, i agree     Im not gey tho
i felt that the 8th one was going a bit to ofar with the crazy, so i think i'll get lost hard o nthis one then. wil lstill probably watch it though
Is this the story of the Falcon project by SpaceX?
They said Big Brian was Babysitting all the kids.
Since 6 I’ve gradually lost interest as they have just become more and more stupid. 1st one was so simple and fun without all the ridiculous set pieces. Since Paul died they have completely lost focus.
Family > Physics
Okay, Chris where do you get all these cool T-Shirts?
F10 will have transformers and dinosaurs, luckly Paramount can pull it off
Remember when these movies were about illegal drag races? Yeah, me neither.
As someone who worked in the airline industry for many years every time i hear F9 i just think of frontier airlines lol
Domenic Torreto is an Avenger  Side note: fast 10 features Super Mario
Man, i thought they jumped the shark with 2Fast, but you're saying NOW they jumped the shark?
Fast and Furious is becoming like Indian action movies 😭
Next movie title: Fast 10 Your Seatbelts
I realized years ago that these were superhero movies.  And that's the only mindset that I can have that will allow me to watch them.
Thank you for this review idk why but I loved it 😂😂😂 your always honest and I love it!
Fast and Furious is becoming like Indian action movies 😭
The most fun review by far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This series has literally outdone itself. Pure laugh-fest. Stopped watching after F7.
Fast and Furious is becoming like Bollywood/Indian action movies 😭
F10: Fas-ten your seat belts 😂
Campea and Robb hate it
I mean Vin is Groot so I guess wood no longer hurts him? Maybe?
Why not give F9 an F
I can't wait for Fast10: When Khan, who doesn't have a family shows up on Earth and the Fast Family has to team up with the Avengers and Zack Snyder's Justice League Family by using car engines and the power of family to create an interdimensional portal to the Family Guy universe and using Peter Griffin's power of family to beat Khan. In the end The Flash gives a family pep talk to Khan and defeats him, and Khan starts a family with Michael Scott and the Dunder-Mifflin Family, who are also glad that they could come. Also that's what she said.
So it's bad, but worse than the other movies? 🤔🤨 The degrees of terribleness is scrambling my brain.
Will they be in next Avengers?
Did he watch it with or without the gay sex?
I really wasn't feeling this movie
We'll soon have more Fast and Furious sequels than Final Fantasy.  There's your crossover- FF meets FF.
Justin Lin has stalled Star Trek with his Star Trek Beyond Stupid. Who the hell thought a F&F director was appropriate for Star Trek. Sure ST Into Plagiarism didn’t leave it in a great state by JJ but you don’t put out a dumpster fire with napalm.
they went orbital is the new jump the shark.
Will you review In the Heights Chris? I'd love to see your thoughts
Fast Ten Your Seatbelts.
This franchise was overkill BEFORE the 1st one came out...
What happened to movies? Jesus Christ.😞
6:10 Movie Producers" Write that down Write that down"
Can't wait for this film to win the Plam D'or at Cannes
F9 is a Nigerian movie with Bollywood action scenes 🤣🤣
John Cena is sorry he made this movie
Chris Stuckman: "F9 lost me" F&F Presents Hobbs & Shaw: Cyborg Idris Alba ""I'm black Superman"
jong xi na has bin chiling in this movie
Vin probably fired the writer because he wrote Hobbes&Shaw.
FX.   that title would certainly fit how ridiculous the movie have become with tons of FX.
Fas10 your seatbelts.
Dom's crews probably exploring the multiverse by the time Fast 12 rolls around
FF10 Don will be battling climate change punching Moon from orbit!
Family
Those “in the theater room” briefing jokes never hit in these trailers damn. Thats a bad sign lol 😭
i have honestly never enjoyed the FF franchise, watching these films makes me embarassed for the few good actors the franchise has gotten like kurt russell, helen mirren and charlize theron.
I laughed that you were wearing your jurassic park shirt, especially because there's a rumored crossover of these franchises.
In the words of Uncle Cosmonaut, Fast and Furious is an anime
The next one needs to be a modern day 2 fast 2 furious
Should’ve been a big fat fucking F . They called it a keystroke lol love you forever man
Tokyo Drift was still the best one
lmao the function key @ the beginning
since F6 or F7 im waiting for a cameo for any Avenger lol for the f orm there are invicible a doing all that crazy sht lol
The type of people who love this film are the same people who look at there sisters and get a semi.
“The movie’s a key stroke.” Had me dying 🤣🤣🤣
I swear to god if they do a fast and furious movie where these people are actually superhero’s I’ll be so happy
I've been unironically a fan of this franchise for years but they lost me in 8. I wasn't a huge fan of the sixth movie and they almost lost me in 7 but I understand that movie had to deal with Paul Walker's tragic death so I wasn't too hard on it (most of the problems come from having a lot of the movie shot before he died) and to be fair, Walker's goodbye was really well done. But 8 was just too stupid and kind of self aware and like winking to the audience in a way this franchise had not been ever and Hobbs and Shaw just proved that was the direction this franchise was going moving forward (Hobbs and Shaw is the fucking worst), so I'm sad to learn 9 is just going to be another dissapointment.  They definetly should have ended this whole thing in 5, which was the natural conclussion.
Isnt it the Mexican lady son
It was not bad in Action
The thumbnail is all I needed to see
I might have watched it if not for John Zina now its just another movie I can proudly say I dint bother watching
I was done when Dom picked up a missile from the water and moved it…while it was fired from a sub
Franchise died with paul walker just let it rest for gods sake
I would love to see Jim Jarmusch directing FF10 😂
Fast10 Your Seatbelts? No?
Obviously doms dad isnt dead and will return in the next movie. He will be cyphers boss 🤦🏾‍♂️
Ayoo someone who loves F5 it's definitely the best one.
I like the big reveal that Dom’s brother has been there all along we just couldn’t see him
Notice how Chris is wearing a Jurassic park shirt. Subtle hints 😉
2 fast2 furious had a draw bridge "surprise" in the movie which to me was "Oh this is a comedy" moment and after that movie everything went just 😂😂😂
I'm sure they're going to lose their way eventually; I thought fast and furious ended by seven or eight; that one movie before that guy passed away.
It was garbage
FF11: Fast and Furious Kills the Justice League
outer space - checked going back in time to race/fight hitler - still waiting
Was john cena talking chinese in this movie
"It's kind of a comedy actually. You're gonna have a great time!" - Chris Stuckmann
So chris is  The rock's fan You know what i mean. If Rock was in f9 Grade would been better. Sorry chris
*sees Jurassic Park shirt* Did you get to see the Jurassic World Dominion preview, Chris?
We're furious and fast again....welcome to fast and furious 1000 ground zero in space!
I had thought they switched it to being a comedy a long time ago?
I wonder if this series is going to end at F12 because that's how many F keys there are on a computer keyboard.
I hope they never stop making these movies, they’re hilarious
Chris's problem with this movie is pretty much the problem i have with this entire franchise lmao
You should have given it a D minus instead
So you are saying this movie is basically the same as a Asylum knockoff.
In summary for those who dont watch the whole video: the movie is a fun movie if you just go to watch it for comedy, if you jusr go for the action and emotional parts' you MIGHT be a little dissapointed
Can’t wait for them to face me
:-)
If you didn't think this sagas was a comedy since F5, you are absolutely blind. I go watch these movies to laugh and get impressed at their ridiculousness. They are all the greater for it.
If you consider F&F a Table Top campaign then by F6 most of them would have enough natural CON and DEX to pull off the impossible stunts.
i knew that would end up going to space using a car, i fucking knew it
The minute this series became self aware is when it went downhill in my opinion.  First three are still my favorite, just give me a small scale litte crime story
C- Dang
It's so past it's time , FAST AND FUCKED, just stop making more movies pleaseee🖕🖕🖕
Chris, are you going to review "In the heights"?
Should have stopped at F7
Them explaining how Han lived was absurd. That is all.
The way you felt about this one is the way I’ve felt about every one past 5  They even brought Han back?🤦🏻‍♂️
They still alive? 💀 Power of family
2:08  "Cars.. often.... CATCH human beings..!!" 😂😂😂
Are there giant robots? I won't accept the series ending until they fight Cypher in a giant robot.
I hope part 10 is titled Flying Fast and Furious In Space!
Wow, I'm going to have to call my man Justin and tell him to watch this. Lmao.    Now as far as you saying its science fiction. Oh yeah, it isn't close to being accurate. Go back to the very first movie. When Dom and Brian are racing and Brian almost had him. Lol. A quarter of a mile took 2 minutes and some change to go that far. The speedometers were reading over 130mph. Lol. But like you said, they are really good movies to go and watch. You don't need to think to hard and escape reality for a little while.    I wonder what my boy Justin is going to say???? Lol. He takes his work very seriously and he told me that the script was really troubling at times. I haven't been able to see the movie yet and I am a huge fan of the series.
Chris look, the fast and the furious was never to be taken seriously after part 3.
Too bad it's terrible. I was gonna see it next week
The first two were enjoyable enough. Hell I like Tokyo drift compared to all of the shit these movies have put out since the 4th installment. When the rock came it it became superheros with cars and it's fucking stupid.
I'm seeing this opening night and reviewing it on my channel saturday morning
Fast and Furious is the Scorcher of real life Here we go again.... Again....     Again
You watched Hitman's Bodyguard and F9 back to back. I wonder how many brain cells you lost.
Fast family will be next with everyone from wwe and ufc …
They should add a disclaimer for the audience. " Kindly Keep Your Brains At Home "
I was interested in this until John Cena sold out to the CCP.
John Cena is the worst part of this movie…and I probably won’t ever watch this
Wait, you have a fast and furious favorite film?
FX lol
Come on, man. This franchise is absurd to the extreme since, at least, F5. And now you're shocked? Give me a break.
At this point it seems logical to do fast furious and transformer cross over
Are we invincible? Paul Walker from heaven: I wasn't, assholes.
My favorite films in the franchise are mostly Fast 5 and Furious 7
So many awful movies now I'm glad Chris watches and reviews them to warn me about them - Chris watches all the bad movies so I don't have to and for me to just watch the good stuff
Huh? What?
Ejecto Seato Cuz !!!! 🤣😂
Hobb and shaw was the best, love the chemistry
Paul walker is still alive off screen in the movies. The 3 kids were with him while F9 was happening
After Tokyo drift, these movies are absolutely trash. There not entertaining, there literally so over the top, the way they took a badass street racing franchise into a mission impossible, literally impossible, joke of a series
If the next movie isn't them teaming up with the Avengers then forget it.
Fast-10 your seat belts.
All that matters is FAMILY 🤪🤪🤪😂😂😂
is F9 the famous Jumped the Shark episode? ha ha
Once the juice of the best orange fruit is running out there is nothing else left to get but the bitterness of the skin.... Sad ... They just dont know when to stop...
The franchise should've ended 20 years ago.
John Cena sold his soul for this dumb car movie.
Remember when this franchise was about car races?
It was always a shitshow. Welcome to reality!
Reminds me of the bond franchise and it going from good serious movies to basically cartoons and a parody of itself.
Fast and Furious is becoming like Bollywood/Indian action movies 😭
Nice DragonBall tattoo, you got to do one video on your tatts
He gave an F for Family
My middle portion also sags. :(
I think they said in the movie that they left little Brian with Brian. That’s the safest place for him.. then again I was piss drunk while watching this train wreck so don’t take my word for it.
If the next instalment is about battling aliens in which they blew up the white house, it would be called ‘Furious X : Family Day’.
Shits just got dumb af now
0:43 made my day much better
I’m only seeing this to see how they brought back my boy Han.
There are some things that just would work better animated... This franchise would make a great anime
Chris have you seen "Invincible" on Amazon Prime?
Nerdwriter did a whole video essay on the bank vault scene in fast five. They did majority of it practically! Give it a watch!
2 uploads in two days , wow
Chris is really getting pumped releasing two reviews within a few couple of hours.
Lmao! The thumbnail 💀
Fast 9 is just Fast 6 upside down
Two things: :D *If* not a true fan, I watch, and then take it seriously, and then feel offended that it insulted my intelligence? Yet, a true fan will watch it, *not* take it seriously - walk in with a smile, walk out with a happy grin, satisfied? :D
Whenever You feel Useless then just remember Chris' Videos have comment section.
Movie sucked so hard I had to watch super fast after to see if I could tell which one was the spoof movie
Unfortunate
The movie looks good
The 10th movie will either be called FUR10US or FAS10FURIOUS
they should of alt+f4 before F4
The franchise ended at 7 for me. And not just for Paul, but because like 7 was over the top. But the storyline with Brian kept me there. The flip car stuff in 6 was alright, I actually love the bank vault in 5 because that was done practically (you should check out behind the scenes and what the crew had to do to get those shots). But jumping a car through a building was pretty much jumping the shark
F-9 gets and F-
Absurdity level:📈📈📈
@0:41 made me laugh uncontrollably for like 5 mins.
I just want to fill my mouth with overprice Nachos and M&M's while watching this movie
FF20 - Dom vs Thanos. "One Last Ride"
I enjoy your reviews of ridiculous movies the most.
Chris is right next movie FX
At this moment,I don't care if Dom's car turns into the next Transformer....
I expected them to go to space at some point, so I am not at all surprised, if a little disappointed they weren't racing around on the moon in their modified cars.
I wish this franchise would go and die. It gets more and more stupid for eac movie. Loved the first three ones and thats it. So happy i have not seen 6-infinity
C- was way too high for this trash,
I JUST WANT IT TO GO BACK TO STREET RACING PLEASE
So I guess in the next two movies will take place in heaven and hell.
Only 1,2,3 and 5 were any good.
I’m going to watch this in 4dx. It’s going to be the first movie I watch in 4dx because I assume there’s a lot of action and you don’t need to worry about the story
“The Fast series is just a stupid shonen anime where the main characters are just naturally stronger than everyone else.” -Marcus, 2020
So... Chris has seen the Dominion preview? 👀
Anyone still a fan of this franchise are lost in life
people will remember this movie in the future the way I see Moonraker today. The worse and most ridiculous james bond movie ever made.
For me, Fast Five is the most absurd, because there's no f*cking way they would find free traffic in Rio in the middle of the day
The next one has to become Fas10 your seatbelts
If orbit can be achieved at 150 miles in the air given you maintain a velocity of 17000 mph, that means that it took 600 quarter miles to reach orbit, and that mean that once they reached orbit, they were going 68,000 quarter miles an hour, or 18.8 quarter miles a second. This proves that theres only one reason to measure every distance in 1/4 of a unit that only 3 countries use... Family.
Remember when these movies were just about street racing?
the progression of the Fast and Furious movies are like the progression of GTA Online vehicles getting further and further into sci fi cartoony insanity; I kinda like it.
A real blindspot for Chris as a film critic is that he gives movies *quite a bit* of credit for not trying to be good, or being aware that they're bad. I've seen several legitimately good, if flawed, films get a C score in these reviews. To give a joke of a film (as described here) a C- by comparison is pretty inconsistent.
Hi
Maybe in FX, they’ll go inter-dimensional.
I miss Paul Walker 🥺 it’s really not the same without him
Just Big Dumb Fun This one is off the tracks hilarious! Pop Corn Munching Silliness
Who babysits brian is none of our business. We watch the fast and furious movies for the crazy stunts not worrying about who's babysitting some brat.
F&F walked so Sharknado could run so F&F could sprint
What kills me is that Vin keeps justifying these cash grab movies in Pauls memory.  If you were a Paul fan and heard him speak on these movies, he said the reason he loved these movies and his character so much was because they found a way to keep a balanced pulse between reality & Hollywood fun.  Literally the movie after Paul died, Vin was the bad guy kissing Charlize, she also drives 100 remote control cars.  Now in 9 Han is back, Vin has a brother we have NEVER heard about in 20 yrs, everyone seems invincible and they are literally in fucking space.  If Paul were to see this straight up he would be disappointed in so many ways.
LEGO movie with Hot Wheels
**Plot Twist** :  *This whole Franchise* was told from the perspective of Dom’s Daughter / Son and it’s the fractured memory of a child trying to make her father and his street racing gang “The Good Guys” and that’s why the dialogue is ridiculous and the action defies physics - - because it’s told from the perspective of an unreliable narrator who was too young to know what really happened.
Man the first review I am disappointed with. You didn't watch in IMAX dude. You could have been saved by JW Dominion's teaser.
The next one should be called. Fast 10: Your seatbelts
Naw it’s gonna be called Fast10 Your Seatbelts.
They should really start expanding their vocabulary and add in more variety. F9 is great, especially for Funk, but you can use so many other chords like F13, F11, F6, F6/9, F7b9. There are endless options.
Fast 10 can ONLY be called "Fas10 Your Seatbelts," I will accept nothing less.
For the sake of Taiwanese people, lets spend our money wisely this time around.
Fast Furious 7 had a beautiful ending. A part of me wishes that was the true ending, Even F8 had a beautiful ending but the more they make it’s simply becoming greedy.
They were stealing projection TVs and DVD players in the first movie.  Just reminding everyone.  You are getting very old
Please end this franchise already
This is the first time I’ve been excited for a fast and furious movie since furious 7, I’m lowkey so excited to see how ridiculous it will be. im going into it thinking its going to be the funniest movie of the year
Dominic Toretto in the FF series is actually an origin story of for the Doom Slayer.
I checked out when they hacked a nuclear submarine on dry dock. Got it in the water and caught up to speeding cars
I won't be watching this CCP propaganda machine supporting BS
I agree with you 💯 percent. But they did say in the movie. They left baby Brian with adult Brian 🤣🤣
This entire franchise seems to same trajectory as Saints Row, Street level game with racing and crime and a story to super powers and aliens and consistently more ridiculous events that happen to the player.  I wouldn't be surprised if that's where it's going.
F259: DOM ETERNAL Plot - DOM becomes god of cars.
Glad it’s still about family
You just gotta watch the FF movies like American anime
-tuve fé  -QUÉ????
This is movie is a set up for a FF super hero spin off franchise. That's why Hobbs and Shaw was about a super soldier
Jesus can this franchise die already?
It sounds completely horrible... complete and utter dogshit.
They become super heroes !!!
even thou a lot of f&f fans disappointed. I'm still OK with F9 but it should end with Furious 7 (that's what I thought when I was 11 in 2015).
We want the Hilariocity Review of this, Chris. Come on!
they lost me the minute I saw the trailer and I'm supposed to believe dom, of all people, has a long-lost brother he never talks about.
They should do a ending with a kid sleeping and we learn it was all in his dreams
The best thing about the Movie is that it is called F9  key on the Keyboard.
Gotta disagree with you on this one, these films have been absolutely absurd since Five and only become more and more unwatchable. I bailed when Paul Walker died and they didn't respect his memory by ending it.
They jumped the Supra
First one was the One, even the widely unlikeable third understands the core - racing.
Inevitably, Fast and Furious is transitioning into Wacky Races.
Is that Yelena in the trailer footage?
Chris confirmed what I thought F9 would be - a cartoon.
The 10th HAS to be called FasTEN Your Seat belts
Bro, I'm just gonna watch it , turn off my brain and eat a lot of popcorn
To me it was six when it ends.
5 was crazy with the fault but really fun. Then 6 with the flying across the bridge scene lost me. And the rest I just hate 😂  For me FF series ended with 5 cause this has been my point exactly,these movies have become absurd
They nuked the fridge over the shark into orbit and were caught by a car………….attached to a rocket……………..holding a magnet🤨
Sounds like they are coming dangerously close to that area where they are trying to intentionally be campy.  There has to be some level of sincerity and genuine cluelessness for it to work.  It's how when people set out to make the next "The Room" or "Troll 2".  It never quite works because the filmmakers are in on the joke.
The pass few FF movies are dumb plots built around action scenes. They should stop with the LAME plots and do 1 and half hours on stunt scenes. People will still waste money on that.
Fast 9 is the closest to a real life anime
I skipped 2 and stopped after 3.. then I randomly saw Kurt Russell in 7 and gave 8 a try, and Hobbs and Shaw. I would've jumped on the FnF bandwagon sooner had I known they went full-on 80s buddy cop/comedy action fests. Not just the street racing stuff.
Waiting for that F9 Hilariocity Review
Me when im only going to F9 to see the jurassic world dominion short
Vin Diesel is a horrible movie maker when he is in any kind of control... miss his older movies...
They’re in the matrix
So, what's gonna come in F10? Time travel or warp speed?
Fast 9 is the worst Fast and the Furious movie.
This is the most Hollywood movie ever made. Every cliché, every trope, and every gimmick Holywood has ever put out, it's all in this one.
WHERE? Where is the "realism" in any of these movie from 5 on ? Fine, you can have your opinion, but you are out of your skull, if you think these movies are anything CLOSE to realistic. Just say you didn't like it, and move on.
I said this after Hobbs and Shaw. It's only a matter of time before there's a Marvel crossover and these guys are fighting freaking Galactus alongside the Avengers.
The hilarious thing is that Vin Diesel treats these movies like they're oscar winning drama movies in interviews.
Everything chris is saying makes me want to see this even more
F10 - It's us again. F11 - We're off to heaven. F12 - Dom vs elves.  F13 - Dom and the magic bean. F14 - Still raking in the green. F15 - This is becoming obscene.  F16 - Now we're racing submarines. F17 - This one features Wolverine. F18 - So shaky you'll need Dramamine. F19 - Dom goes to the guillotine. (thank god)
Next movie they're gonna be driving spaceships.  Edit: I truly didn't know that they went to space in this movie. I commented this in the middle of the video.
6:08 I would also accept "FAST AND FUR10US" or "Fast10 Your Seatbelts"
When he started talking about a character falling into water I knew it was the bit from the trailer with Dom then he says he has a vision I’m like is that really what happens lmao
Its always been that stupid right? Lol
I want the next one to be called fast ten your seat belts
How tf are Vin and John brothers?! lol same mom different dads?! Or same dad different moms ??? I need answers!!!
C-
Can't wait for F300
The first movie, the second movie and Tokyo drift and Just stop!
Very well said sir! 👍 After I watched this movie I was like "Man! Did they really did that?!". This movie is more absurd than Hobbs and Shaw and that says something.
Next one will be called "Fast10 your seatbelts!"
Aliens are Real!?
When will they crossover with marvel because they’ve all been superheroes since Fast 6
His son was with Brian as far as I understood
I wouldn't be surprised if there was a crossover between FF and Salman Khan now.
Maybe this is all happening in Dom's head while he is in a coma after he crashed his Charger in the first film.
Fast 10 will be called: FXXX: Dom vs Xander Cage
C- is generous for this garbage
"Coming soon in 2022:   Fast & Furious 86--Flying Mobility Scooters."
F10's just going to be part of the MCU at this point, isn't it?
FX would be about time travel just watch
Jumped the shark!
I love that you used the F9 key of a keyboard to explain the movie. Thats about as close to car racing as these are anymore 😆🤣
Chris every two minutes - "This kinda lost me, guys".
"Look, I have the Tire Collection!" :D  I think this might be the one that sells me on watching one of these movies.
Chris grew up with Fast 9
Chris : I got the tyre collection Me : You got what now ?
Does John Cena hit VIn Diesel with his signature F.U in this movie?
9 movies and they call it The Fast Saga? imagine if it was The Slow Saga
The fact that they made this movie is a disgrace.
I hope for the final movie fast and furious 11 they do time travel
This FF movie should've been the one called: "F9: Too Fast & Too Furious"
I watched the movie, and there was a line that says that Brian (the child) was with Paul Walker's Brian.
FAMILY.
The best thing I like to get from these movie reviews is just to get a feel and what to expect from the movie itself, this is great, I'm gonna go watch it.
Imagine a planet with dumb enough general audience to allow 9 of these fucking things..
Shocked Stockman likes them... most suck and all are preposterous. I do kinda like 5 tho. N 1 and was cool.
This movies explanation for Han's survival is dumb
The Jurassic Park shirt is a nice touch lmao
I wonder if F9 is in any way a nod to SpaceX's F9 (Falcon 9), considering what happens
Can you do a hilariousity video for the Ruby Rose and Morgan Freeman movie, Vanquish 😅🤣🤣🤣😂😂
this should be hilariocity review
I won't be surprised if there's gonna be time travel in the upcoming F&F movies 😂
Please do a steins gate review
Wait this was released ?
F&F movies are ridiculous, but I stan and will forever watch 😅
You can only suspend your disbelief from the wackiness for so long, and F9 went so far in that side, that its hard to take this movie seriously
Taiwan is a country.
john cena declaring his love for CCP did it for me, may be the next movie will be called Final Fast & Furious Fantasy and let the franchise die in peace
This is Bollywood .. 😂😂
Okay now chris talks about some realism and logic... but during army of the dead it's okay to forget it.😂 This is biased chris 🤷🏻‍♂️ !
F10: Dom's car is actually Optimus Prime in disguise
Fan service for goofballs who love wrestling, cars and guns. I lost interest after Tokyo Drift.
Lets be honest, all of these movies have sucked but people just somehow ignore that because the action is entertaining.
They next one has to be called "Fast and Furious: Ultimate" so we can refer to it as "FU"
No more real movies just stupid Hollywood crap to make money, before movies actually thought us something this Hollywood thing these days is  so pathetic
I cannot support this franchise anymore because of John Cena’s anti-Taiwanese sentiment. China doesn’t own the world.
My guy said they were in orbit! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Fam, WTF??? They've really gone this ridiculous? Smh
Everything you described to me is why I have been enjoying Fast and Furious movies. I want to see over the top almost wrestler like personas do crap with cars that I did with my hot wheels when I was 8 years old. These movies to me are the closest thing we will get to those over the top movies characters are watching in the background in other movies. It’s a comedy that everyone is in on, the audience, the cast, and the crew. The most dumb fun I have in a theatre.
Lmao please tell me you started coughing after that first laugh haha. Great review Chris 👏
Next movie they cross over with justice league and vin diesel beats up superman
lmao, "f9"  *shows the f9 key*
The poster of fast and furious 9 smoke In the background of the actors with all the colors looks like something out of Gekisou Sentai Carranger or Power Rangers Turbo for you Americans
This "franchise" sucks. Cena is a tool. Walker added heart but that's about it.
FasTEN your seatbelt for the next 1 guys
This convinced me to definitely watch this
That JP shirt is amazing.
I really wanna watch it. lmao
But is it better than Notes from Melania?
YEAH the furious films ended with the 7th film as far as im concerned RIP F&F
It's official. F9 is now a Bollywood action movie.
Wait it came out
Chris in Thumbnail: This movie is coming in fast and furious!
I'm really surprised that you liked this stupid movie franchise.  Nine is where they kinda lost you?? You said all the movies have managed to maintain staying away from crossing into ridiculous until now??? Really?? This franchise jumped the shark near the beginning.  Watch them again Chris, there's ridiculous stupidity in all of them. The first one is the only one closer to reality (except for that quarter mile race which seems to go on for 2 miles lol). Every scene is an eye roller even the one's where it's nothing but Dom talking about family 🙄
Two reviews in one day. What bewitchment is this? 😶
Please stop.
Instead of a Fast and Furious/Jurassic World crossover, they should do a crossover with Terminator or 24 or Die Hard!
"It is 100% a cartoon"   I'm sold
Surprise that they didn’t have a E.T cameo when they went to space
I know I'm old. Two hours of endless action/crash sequences? Boring. And I LIKE Vin Diesel.
They didn't lose ya man. They got your dumb money. F&F lost me after the 2nd film. Goodbye! Forever
The next one should called FU
Yup, I can see it now. Sooner or later we will have Fast & Furious vs. Avengers.. I'm sure of it 👍. 🤣🤣
they better not go to space next edit: i stayed for the spoiler. fuck my life.
At some point they will fight of an alien invasion of earth.
I'm a huge fan of the franchise but this movie is STOOOPIDT and it really annoys me how Dom always has to win every fight.  Plus they ruined Furious7 & Tokyo Drift by that ridiculous explanation on how Han survived 😞
SEES THUMBNAIL. Well you don't look happy Chris.
They should make a new one where the cars turn into Iron Man armors
Stuckman: Ridiculous, ridiculous and ridiculous! Ludacris watching this review: This dude keeps saying my name wrong man!
This feels like 8 minutes of Chris visibly contemplating whether this is gonna be his next hilariosity review
To my homeboy John Cena: 台灣是一個國家!
3:03 “where you could get invested in the film without bursting into laughter” I beg to differ, sir, and that’s exactly why I’ve fallen so in love with these things. I think they should say “fuck it” and take Vin Diesel to space and have the Fast franchise lead directly into the Riddick franchise, breathing new life into both universes now combined
Where is your score dude?   I guess you would have given it an "F"
Little Brian was said to have been with Brian O’conner the whole time.
Oh. This might as well be science fiction?? I’m sorry but I feel like I’m the only one who thought the “Fast Saga” got too ridiculous long ago. I’d say from 6 on it’s a bit too much for me. Maybe 7.
Only thing that can take down the family is sharknado
Chris in the thumbnail: "Why are they still running?"
Chris: "I'm going to get into a minor spoiler, so here's the spoiler"..     The Ad fuckin plays
The series jumped the series for me when I first saw F7. I loved Hobbs & Shaw because it kinda made fun of the absurdity of the franchise. I'd rather watch just Statham and the Rock have 10 movies of their own series. The main franchise series lost it's heart after Paul Walker's death.
The trailer alone was enough for me to say nope like a year ago.
My guess is they are in purgatory lol.
0:41 well I guess you can say you have the en-TIRE collection
These movies are so much better when you don’t have someone next to you acting like they’re above them
"WE ARE FAMILY" HAHAHAHAHAHA
When it stopped being about racing and cars, I checked out. 🙄
Hey Chris is back
so now I'm MORE hyped?
do airplane! {1980} review
*Looks at thumbnail* Fast9 is a hilarocrity rant in the making
Brian was taking care of Dom's son, they mention that when Mia visits Dom and Letty.
Did Dom just use a car to "cushion" Letty from falling on soft earth? What?
I said the same shit. Jumped the shark. Cars in space. It was a fucking joke. C- is really kind. I give it a sold f or a dog shit review. It was so bad. Biker boys was a better movie. Or what ever it was called. Fast and furious with bikes. It sucked this sucked more. Don’t spend your money on this stinking turns.
Man, watching ur review feels like comedy already, i was laughing to how ridiculous the movie will be..
2 action films turned into comedies back to back? Imma have a fun weekend. Also idk why I laughed so much at 7:17
See, I knew this was going to happen sooner or later once they started veering away from cars and switching over to action.  It's kind of sad to see what this franchise has become.  I've always been a car guy so obviously I went to see the original Fast and Furious movie in theaters when I was 16 and absolutely loved it.    I loved Fast Five but felt they steadily declined after that simply due to outright ridiculousness.
The only race in this movie was the jacob and doms flashback race
I honestly haven't taken the series serious since like Fast 5 lol. Like, in that, you got Dom vs Hobbs. You brought that up yourself. But even that fight was just bullshit. Dom is just damn street racer. Dom shouldn't be able to win a fight against a specially trained dude who goes after serial killers and people do all kinds of messed up shit. But Dom manages to win in Fast Five which to me is just bullshit. And now Dom is just Superman. He can do no wrong, he faces no consequences. He can do everything. He's the best at everything.   I'm not even gonna watch F9. I'm not watching the Dom Show. These movies might as well say at the end "Next time on the Dom Show, watch as Dom fights his way out of a situation that shouldn't be possible because, you guessed it, family. Family is the only thing he needs." or some shit like that.
Next one better be titled FasTen
Five was the best nothing comes near that
F8 was already garbage, though. the entire zombie cars thing, the u-boat part, and vin diesel's car pulling wires to flip 4 other cars over. it's been completely stupid for a while now.  Tokyo Drift remains the best. the only F&F about racing.
Where is the Optimus Prime cameo?
Blockbuster to premiere at Cannes 🌚🌚
I don't care how dumb this franchise gets, i will always love it and enjoy it.
Hearing “See You Again” for the 700th time doesn’t make me think of Paul Walker anymore. It makes me think of Vin Diesel beating his corpse over and over with a baseball bat while coins fall out of his mouth and eyes and ears.
This one? THIS one?? THIS IS THE ONE... that lost you?! This thing has been going off the rails (hilariously and sometimes entertainingly) a while ago.
Yea i been catching FF films on hbo since F5 its just too much your right…
The opening is my favorite Stuckmann joke in years
"this kid was locked in a wooden box this whole movie, i know it" LOL
Chris is that shirt an allusion to the much discussed future FF/JW mashup?
Not about cars anymore 👎👎
This may be the only fast and furious movie that I may watch. Making it a comedy sounds a lot better to me.
who dis ?
Oh no, it's become self aware? That was one of this franchises biggest strengths that despite all the silly shit happening the characters always treated it as deadly serious to a comical degree. That self seriousness in the face of increasingly silly shit Is what made it endearing. Once you start leaning into it and having the characters go meta you are losing the charm of the entire franchise (well at least from 4 onwards).
No Rock so...
Remember when this franchise was about stealing DVD players?
I heard a rumour that they actually wanted Dave Bautista to play the role of Dom's brother, but he turned down the role, so they went with John Cena.  Which makes sense, because Bautista is a more convincing brother to Vin Diesel than John Cena is.
When people ask me what I thought of F9, the word I use is insulting. The serious drama from the flashbacks contrasted with the dumb action in this movie is so jarring it made me laugh so much. Terrible movie
' Fast and Furious 20: La Familia back from the Future's Future alternative Galaxy '
As American Dad points out, it has to be written with tons of gay sex and then edited down for the theater. The gay undertone is crucial for a good Fast and Furious movie.
Getting stuckmannised twice in a day!! GREATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!
Naming the kid Pablo would've have been a better choice
The franchise lost me when someone resurrected and the bullets made wings in his back, there's nothing realistic about none of them but it is what it is.
The next one has to be Fast 10 your seatbelts
The only reason I’d go watch this movie is to see the Jurassic World trailer; which made it feel like Chris’s shirt was taunting me.
Anyone want to point how every single one of Doms siblings are white and he’s the only Latino just strange
F10: Avengers Assemble
So the title of the movie is actually: F-Nine–ally Jumped the Shark?  Honestly though, they crossed the line after 5. 5 was the last one that was just dumb enough but didn’t go completely overboard. Every other one is basically too stupid for its own good and I can’t watch them without laughing at the ridiculousness of them.  The next movie is going to straight have looney toon logic. Like pairing tunnels on walls and driving off ledges but not falling until they look down.  They should’ve stopped at 7.
F9 poster at the beginning is great lmao
they said the kid was with brian . safest hands
is this movie streaming anywhere yet?
Who else remembers when these movies were about street racing and not superhuman secret agents doing car-fu?
You dont have to watch them in order, they all have a different storyline.  I watched them backwards from F9 to the first fast and furious and it made alot more sense
This franchise lost me at 8. But then Hobbs & Shaw sort of won me back, if I completely forget what Shaw did to Han that is. But even with the trailers, my expectations with this one were low, and from this review, sadly it seems all my fears have come true
It went from Fast franchise to XXX. Remember when the heist was DVD players? xD
so you saying it turned into what lost the series turned into in season 4
F8 lost it for me.  Taking control of 100s of cars and driving them remotely and the remote control submarine were too much.  But the worst part of it was Dom going behind the back of his "family" and not trusting them to help.
Next one have to be FX.. eXtreme
absolute crap, for peanut brains only.
Even after so long without any big releases, I instinctively look for your reviews Chris. Best movie reviewer on the internet! 🙌💥
FX? They could just call it "The fas10 the furious"
You should do a ranking of these films
The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull of the Fast and Furious franchise.
I stopped after Tokyo Drift and the First movie with Paul Walker and never looked back. Best decision.
Wow the F9... (Button)😂😂
..did they go to space?
I cannot stress how hard I laughed at the F9 at the start. Bravo
Hey, remember when John Cena pathetically apologized to the CCP, for even insinuating that Taiwan is an actual country? They can shove their garbage movies up their bums.
Insert Invincible title card for every impossible thing that happens to the characters
The best one was the first one, but it was still just point break with racing instead of surfing.
I think this franchise lost me since FF7, I know the exact scene where I was like "ok fck this, I am done with this franchise" and it was the car jump from one building to another in UAE I think. Granted there probably have been dumb scenes before that too but for some reason that movie and scene broke the camel's back for me. Wanted to leave the theater in between 7, didn't watch 8, not gonna watch 9. Good for people who still enjoy them though its entertainment after all.
From stealing DVD players and hijacking gas trucks to this! Nothing makes sense LOL!
I was wondering when this franchise would finally jump the shark. I kinda thought it happened in F6, but this just sounds ridiculous. They should’ve stopped at 7. That was a perfect ending to an already long franchise.
I don’t need a plot ! I got family !
Big fan of the channel Chris but sheesh you've been dropping a lot of F bombs lately. I had this review on with my son watching and had to turned it off. Guess I'll have to watch your reviews when he's not around or with headphones on.
Whats hilarious about this franchise is the fact that Vin Diesel treats it like it’s Godfather tier. Look up any interview with him talking about Fast and Furious they’re hilarious.
Chris warns people he’s gonna spoil something, yet he already did… with Han returning!! Not everyone has seen the trailers, my friend and his wife avoid all trailers for franchises they love. Other people might do the same so in future Chris don’t assume people know things or have heard things. It was a pretty big reveal in the first trailer last year, no one expected that. So the fact that you spoil something like regardless makes you a jerk
They should've ended it with 5 or 7...6, imo, was kinda weak
ngl this is a great superhero film.
Don't forget John Cena apologizing to the China for calling Taiwan a country so that this movie would do well in China.
I am ridiculously excited to see the laws of physics and science be violated.
I enjoyed this review than the actual movie...
This movie looks like shit
I sincerely hope you consider doing a Hilariocity review for this someday, as it sounds like it would be amazing.
He was a master thief, assassin and high performance thrill driver. He was also a bank clerk, a camp counselor, Santa's helper, a sanitation worker and a star basketball player.  John Cena stars as Ernest P. Worrell in... F9: The Fast and The Ernest.
Han is the only reason I'm watching this movie. I need to know how did they resurrect him
FX : Dark of the Moon!
I'll be honest. This seems like the writers and directors going "Can you stop asking us to fucking make these movies please"
Fast and Furious 9 Hilariocity confirmed for next year.
I was done when Vin Diesel jumped off an exploding tank truck and rolled off concrete from a 40 ft jump. Everybody’s skin is made out of vibranium this movie 😂😂
Chris, this franchise jumped the shark 3 movies ago
They are going to space. THEY ARE GOING TO GO TO SPACE
I'm gonna watch a more commited Movie- SPEED RACER.
No way two chris reviews in two days?
The third One is The Best ONE and that is a fact.
Very underwhelming film.
F9 v F-Zero: Dawn of Stupidity
JOHNNY CHINA!
I’m not even surprised. From Fast 5 on, the series legit became Marvel movies with cars
I play Rocket League and the F&F crossover is back. We can buy the Dodge Challenger and the Skyline from old but now we can also get a Pontiac with a rocket strapped to it. I was like "wtf is this?" even in Rocket League standarts, that thing is just absurd
DO not promote this trash movie.   IM BOYCOTTING IT
I have slowly become a huge fan of how stupid this series has become. Like.. if you took a telenovela, an explosion, and subtract the physics.. you get this. And I'm here for it. It's quite literally a movie series that could get worse and that might actually improve it.
I GAVE IT A F , IT WAS TERRIBLE.
In a film franchise that wipes its ass with the laws of physics as much as this one, how is it that the single most unrealistic thing (besides his acting) is the idea that Vin Diesel could take The Rock in a fight
Soon they will time travel
They go to space!!! 😂
This movie blows your mind.
Z-
Seeing Chris embracing the rainbow colors... puts a smile on my face. (hope F9 is the last one)
If FX lol, is all in space then maybe they can meet Jason Voorhees because Jason X was in space. Fingers crossed
Not going to lie, I chuckled as soon as the video started lol.  Almost on par with fan 4 stick.
I hope the next film is all about them being safe and call it “Fast 10 your seatbelt”
They lost me at F8 personally. Im not going go see this one or any other ever again haha.
Who's ready for Dom to fight the T Rex from jurrasic Park for the next movie?! 😂
i thought they told that brian Jr was babysitted by brian??
F9 is internationally popular and full of family and cars
You know what would be an amazing twist… If come Fast 11 the supposed last movie in the franchise if it’s revealed to have all not happened. Brian never broke Dom out after Fast 4, Dom went crazy inside of Prison and just made up all these crazy insane adventures. Eh maybe not.
The next one needs to be called “Fast 10: Your Seatbelts”
His reaction says. FUCK! 😂
Video 16 Metropolis review request   Christ their still making these
Day 2 of asking Chris to review in the heights
He’s wearing the Jurassic shirt to taunt me about the fact that he ain’t gonna talk about the JW3 sneak peek
"I couldn't believe anything that was happening"..... so you did believe 4-8????
I am ur indian fan , so glad to see this video posted.
John Campea has already said this Movie is really Bad. To over the top.  Glad I am not Invested in this Movie Series.
Boycott John 'Taiwan isn't a country' Cena.
GTA V online live action Cenamatic experience be like :
me: to all F&F fans, these movies were made to watch after you unplugged your brain and just enjoy the action F&F fans: yeah, bro  me:....dude, that's not a compliment...
The series should have ended after Furious 7
Just 2 more films (+others spin-offs I don't care) and boom we are done  Until they change their minds and finish it on a 37829283764th film.
Didn't even know this was a thing lmao.
Has anyone else sick and tired of this stupid franchise? God I can't stand these movies anymore or the Character that Charlize Theron has. I hate her in these movies.
adult hotwhhels ad
so a typical Fast and Furious just turned up a notch or two
How can you take John Cena seriously as a villain after that chinese hostage video?
still waiting for the one where they fight dinosaurs or something
They left Brian with Brian. Cause Paul Walker's character is still alive in the universe. So, because Paul's not alive, his character is babysitting the kids.
Did you catch the Jurassic World opening at the IMax screening of Fast9?
They completely lost me after 7. It should’ve ended then
Dude, the beginning of this review made me laugh so hard 😂 much Love, Man.
F6 is straight trash! I’m surprised that’s one of Chris favorites.
They jumped the Sharknado
You'd think if someone was gonna be Vin Diesel his brother it would be The Rock and not John Cena lol
In the hieghts review please ❤️
They lost me after the last Paul Walker film.
FX: FasTEN your seatbelts
I already know what Chris is going to say by his face in the thumbnail LMAO
It’s about family and that’s what’s so powerful about it.
The lost me a while ago as far as the insanity.
Must be Jason Statham who’s babysitting Brian 😂
Yeah, i bet fast 10 going to be in India where physic doesnt exist in movie
I watched 5 & 6 thinking that this is just stupid but watchable, but come the 7th film it didn't just jump the shark it jump the shark with an ocean attached to it. I could not turn off my brain anymore because i would be brain dead if i had to believe what the NORMAL PEOPLE in that movie survives and does. Never watched another one ever since.
Family ❤
No no no Fast10 needs to be called Faster Your Seatbelts or just not exist
yeah it looks stupid,  but I'm gonna watch it
Me and my friend were watching this movie and ive never laughed so hard at a movie like i did on this one, it was so fucking stupid that halfway through the movie i just started laughing uncontrollably in the theater, but to be honest this movie didn't lose me because thats what i  kinda wanted it to be, this movies were getting progressively more stupid with each entry and this feels like what they've been building up to, just a completely idiotic fun movie, honestly it was probably the most fun theater experience I've had and can't wait to see how stupid fast 10 will be.
Who needs gravity when you got family?
They finally did it. They jumped the shark
"This movie will definitely enjoy people, especially if you go in there thinking it's a comedy " 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Did he talk about VIn Diesel stopping a car with his bare hands....
F9: F**K PHYSICS!
The keyboard F9 made me laugh way more than I expected; I've never liked a video this fast.
FX 🎯
Do you think Netflix Disney plus Hulu are doing what Napster did to the music industry
Upcoming: *Fast 10 your seatbelts*
I was very disappointed too. I’ve been constantly surprised how they’ve kept making these with some sort of in-universe balance act, where it’s very over the top and crazy but somehow rooted in reality so there’s something - just a tiny bit - to hang on to. The way they set up and execute the scenes have been very important. But in F9, all that is thrown out the window. There are not enough reaction shots, not enough sense of some sort of reality. They just went for it here and some might like that. But to me it became “just another dumb action movie” now. It’s not dumb fun anymore… now it’s just dumb.
F8 kind of already lost me a little. The intro to that movie in Cuba was just laughably bad and felt like a parody of the franchise. Rest of the movie was alright though. I’m fully expecting to just laugh my ass off at F9 and I’m sure it’ll be a good time.
A certain Fast and furious meme: “I am inevitable”
F8, F9, F10: The Absurdity Trilogy
Can't wait for FasTEN your seat belts
It's like this series went from Need for Speed to Roadblasters
The image of the F9 key really got me. 😂
It genuinely looks like it broke you on some level :D
So this is the refresh?  Edit: Don’t say jump the shark. They’ll actually jump one in the next one!
They lost me on 8 with all the submarine stuff.
The director said that he wants to do a Crossover with Jurassic World.  I 100% support this LMAO, heck why not make em crossover with Transformers too.  They can add the autobots to "the family"  lmaooooo
*Vin Diesel gets shot in the head.   Vin: I'm ok. The bullet exited out.
Imagine an r rated fast & furious film directed by michael bay jesus christ
“Don’t you guys get it? We’re *Invincible title card*”
Idc if u love it or hate it, i entertained that's it,remember this is f&f everyone knows that
We need a hilariocity review for this!
The first movie is so nostalgic for me it seems the most realistic, they all seemed sweaty and dirty it was gritty
Now they need to create an Alternate reality timeline of Fast movies so that they can eventually end the series on Alt-F4.
I like your rainbow colored bracelet 😊
Tbh I stopped watching Movies where Vin Diesel is in...he used to be a badass actor but now all his movies r low key Bollywood movies...where a movie not about magic or science fiction , defies all laws of physics 🙏🙏🙏
Even science fiction has to have rules for its own universe. :)
John Cena just had surgery. It was an experimental spine replacement.
Its funny that people actually go into these movies thinking its going to be a good drama...hahahahahahaha.  Its like going into watching the expendables thinking its going to be an oscar film....LMAO.  We need these movies more than ever right now, turn off brain and enjoy something cheesy and crazy all at the same time, this is also coming from a guy that enjoys segal and vandamme movies to this day for that reason
Sounds like more Hobbs and Shaw. I literally watched 10 minutes of it and went, nope. And I am a fan. So I'll give this a miss methinks.
If you dont have a brain, go watch this movie
These movies are turning into a GTA online movies.
I gave up after F8. I won't even watch this one.
After hobs & shaw there was no realism
They mentioned that Doms son Brian was with Paul Walkers character off screen for obvious reasons.
I can't wait for Thanos in the next movie
As soon as I see that F9 button, I know this video is going to be awesome 😁
At this point, I would rather picked the fast and furious family over the Avengers. Dom and his friends are literal super heroes!
from now on, every F&F installment should have at least one function key joke
There’s a Fast 9? I thought there were 20 of those those things! I didn’t know there was less than ten. 😂😂😂
I honestly don’t know how people can watch this shit.
I have only ever seen the first two movies.
“We’re not science fiction, we’re science fact.” - (I think) The guy who directed the James Bond movie ‘Moonraker’
You can’t be a fan of the fast saga and hate the transformers franchise at the same time.. they are equally terrible
Well, this is kind of disappointing I was kind of looking forward to this one.
I think Chris Stuckmann just entertained me more than that movie will! FX 😂
Remember when Fast & Furious was a Point Break ripoff about a smalltime gang using suped up cars to steal DVD players from semis on the interstate?
Wow, back-to-back reviews, awesome
Wasn't that whole Bank Vault scene in Fast Five completely real and practical though ?
Imagine they make a fast and furious home alone movie with brian dom's son lmao
They had already lost me at Fast 8. It was just so bad. Not gonna watch this one.
Chris is on a streak today
Next movie is FXXX. Where Dom has to go up against Xander Cage. Haha
In Fast 10 we find out they have all been infected by nano-bots since 5 that give them superpowers.
You forgot that it’s all done with the power of family
Who looked after Emma in Friends the whole time?
I’ve accepted that these movie are now over the top for the sake of being stupid, I’ll still check it out regardless cuz it’s entertaining to me lol. And it’s about to get even more ridiculous, they hinted to a Fast and the Furious crossover with Jurassic Park 🤣. Dumb af but what the hell. It’s a great comedy franchise am I right?!
You lost me when u said 5 and 6 were your favourites
john cena apologizing to the chinese govenment was fucked people shouldnt watch it just cause that crap
It’s all Anime logic
Brian was babysitting Brian lol it was explained a few times lol and I don’t think letty would call Brian her son but you right it is her step son
Fast and furious franchise is the contrary of the Mission Impossible movies
Yeah I like it good funny family movie u can enjoy with ur friends or family
FF is the McDonalds of films. It`s trash. Always was and always will be and the way it is being milked just makes it even more clear. Do some indie- films instead. Pretty please with sugar on top.
Next one is going to be called Fasten your seatbelt
"I don't need Physics, I got family"
These are all a blur in my mind, but didn't it all start with a DVD player heist?
Sorry but these films are trash.
I want it to be called Fas10Furious but that’s just me.
I'm pretty sure they mentioned that Brian was looking after the little Brian, but it's still so stupid that they would just leave their kid, knowing they may not come back
The next movie better be called *"Fast10 Your Seatbelts"*
Can't wait till this whole franchise is over and what's coming after that
I remember a friend invited me for the fast 7 premiere, and it was the single most excruciating experience. 12 hours later my dad said "we are going to watch Fast 7 with your brothers!"
After a year of no blockbusters I’ll take all the absurdity I can get
I hope what John Cena did was worth it.
Uh oh, I don't like that face 😂
Yeah John Cena is in the trailer , but I can’t see them
Some say they are going to do a crossover with the fast and the furious and Jurassic park….. Read that again……
Alt + F4
It was definitely a leave-your-brain at the door movie, but still kinda enjoyable overall. 😁
The franchise lost it when they lost Paul walker.
You know the expression "jumped the shark"? I gotta know, did they literally jump a shark in this movie? If not I'm sure they will in the next movie. Probably a space shark.
Btw they go to space in a car.
I will never watch this bullsh*t!
Great early morning review! The F & F franchise may be going off the rails if the whole outer space rumors for F10 are true!
Do weed edibles and then watch this movie 😂
I’d love to treat this as a comedy if only it would not try so hard to be serious
Still can’t believe this franchise has 9 movies now , and they still have two more to go .. oh man it’s endless
hey chris how do u feel about Brians blue GTR scene at the end
Fast five is the only good FF movie, why even go to space in FF9
Can’t wait for the sequel “ F.U.: give me your money “
the franchise finally jumped the shark.
Nah it should be called FX: FasTEN your seatbelts
clearly you were never a fan of this absurdity if you have any point that is "ok, enough"
Hold up... So Chris literally gave F9 C- and Luca C???
A+++++? Wow can't believe it's that good. Looking. Forward. To. It.
Already pre-ordered my ticket. I'm ready!
I only want to watch this movie because there’s a Jurassic World preview in the beginning. I’m more interested in that 5 minute teaser than any film in this series.
Remember when this movie used to be about street racing? Before they turned into the Avengers in cars?
Two videos in a day. Miracle. Miracle
Like I’ve always said for the past 6 or 7 movies; I missed it when these movies were about tuning and racing import cars.
Ah, the Furious movies. You may not have asked for them, but the one constant in this world is that you will get more of them
Your face says it all: "Um, this was not what I was expecting, but Okay." Lol!
Remember his Fate of the Furious review?  Remember when he said your enjoyment of this franchise depends on how deep the stick is up your butt?  Guess Chris finally found his stick. 😂
Should’ve stopped at 7
When I saw the notification, I was like “WAIT, THERE'S A 9 ALREADY?”
This is my favorite franchise. So I bet I will love it
The only _Fast and Furious_ movie I've seen was _Tokyo Drift._
Overrated series
When I saw the notification, I was like “WAIT, THERE'S A 9 ALREADY?”
After John Cenas apology to China I can't take that guy as an action hero anymore.
Finally I was waitting for this movie review
Thank god I stopped watching after 2 👍🏻
All I know is that for fun, while watching the trailers, I counted how many times any person in their circumstances would die if something happened like that in real life. I think I lost count after 20. You know it’s bad when the most realistic part is Dom catching Letty with his car after she falls off a motorcycle.
John China 🇨🇳🇨🇳
Basically the movie is, good guy fights bad guy, bad guy wins for a while, bad guy turned into good guy, good guys beating Charlize Theron, they won and have a BBQ at the end of the movie talking about FAMILY. What a predictable plot 😂😂😂
At least the bank vault was real though, learned from Nerdstalgic
I'm all for over the top movies but this movie... heh... I feel like it's trying too hard
My grandpa has that tire collection too 😅. It's what got me into the series
Only a matter of time before they team up with the Transformers.
Good popcorn movie to start the weekend I ain't complaining
At the end of the day were all family....in rocket cars.
I can already imagine Cinemasins' sin counter screaming in terror😂
What's in the box.......
It would have been hilarious if he gave F9 an F
My stepdad watches these fucking movies over and over on cable TV.
See you in 2027 for Fast 15!
Remember when this franchise was about street racing?
Tokyo drift is so underrated
It basically became a live action anime
The "F9" keycap LMAO
If one has only seen the first one and directly jumped to this, he might think he is in crazy land.
Your face...made me click this so fast
We’re early! Follow me on Instagram at @fiazfrom2000 thanks
This movie is so painfully stupid! No talent actors and bad cgi! Sad!
watching this instead of doing exams
I laughed outloud at the F9 screenshot xD
F9: Family was mentioned at some point. Thousands of times.
Shit was super trash lmao
The keyboard button caught me off guard 🤣
Love your videos Chris, you made this year more tolerable thank you for being there us ❤️
F9 had nothing to do with racing
Here early and I get to see the review in the morning with my breakfast before work from one of my favorite youtubers and reviewers this is amazing!
These movies suck
This franchise needs to run out of gas
Omg
2 videos in 1 day? We must be blessed     2 C-  even
Chris, please bring back "my favourite movies" segment
John cena’s apology will really hurt this film. Good. Time for these stupid movies to end
I felt very disappointed by this one this is probably the weakest movie in their franchise so far and it keeps going downhill. I seriously did not know to laugh or to cry on how bad this movie is
Physics exist :  F&F characters : “ I missed the part where that’s my problem”
I'm saying it right here and now: These movies became comedies from 7 and on.
Chris' face says it all
i've been waiting for this for a while lol
2 uploads in 24 hours. what a day...., what a lovely day
This is amazing, I love your reviews      TO THE MOON BABY
*Did they go to space is what I wanna know?*
F x9 reactions in the comments please.
Haha seeing this tonight with the cinema colleague at the test screening  But not looking forward to the crowds we gotta have to deal with
Please review resident evil village
Good? 5:12 7:01
Damn ,your face in that thumbnail speaks volumes.
When semz done his review few people said he was being too harsh abhahaha. Now we know
I don't even remember 7 and 8!
I was fast to write this but not furious enough
Still surprised that Chris hasn't reviewed The Boys and Invincible. I guess he doesn't have Amazon Prime :/
I’m over this movies. 😩
John China
This fucking franchise man, it’s so dumb 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Starting the day with stuckmann video is the right way
This should have stopped when Paul Walker died.
>faster than dom >stronger than dom >smarter than dom  familia bros.... could this be the last ride??
Family.
C- I'm not surprised
At exactly what point did this franchise jump the shark?
Family.  Again...  ~_~
I haven’t been this early since you were still a Jehovah witness
Review In The Heights, it's brilliant and beautiful
Remember when these were movies about stealing DVD players? No..?…. Yeah…. Simpler times.
Apparently John Cena is in this but in the trailer I couldn’t see him
Remember when Dom was just a simple mechanic?
Chicken
Got here Fast.  Furiously.  ~_~
We're on 9 already? I must have missed the past 5 films...
Lmao
Tell that to Zods snapped neck
First!
First
