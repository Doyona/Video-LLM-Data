living vicariously through this video
i miss your hawaii contents 🥹
how do you get around copyright with music in your videos?
Great video! I’m planning on moving soon too
Congratulations on your move! Looking forward to seeing how you navigate a new state!
ONE DIRECTION HAS MY HEART
U contribute to locals not being able to live on their own land. Leave the islands.
1:29 we love a beautiful One Direction song moment❤
Love you Hanna life is meant to be lived !! ❤
Can we get and update are you strung out living on the streets now or what
I know this was two years ago now but the fact that she’s flying business/first class for like $5k
I know someone I went to school with who moved to Hawaii all the way from Delaware. She loves it so far!
my dream ever since I was 8 I been wanting to live in Hawaii and go to a university there and right now im trying my hardest to make my dream come true :)
the songs of this video >>>>>>>>>>
her laugh is the best omg
this is all i want
Decided to restart the Hawaii vlogs because they make me happy  :’)
uploaded one year ago today :)
HANNAH i love u so much! you inspire me and so many
AVA IS SO ADORB AND APPRECIATIVE W THE GIFTS AW
This is so irresponsible, Hawa'ii cannot handle more people moving to the islands. You are actively hurting the islands you "love".
3 more years till I can move
I’m planning on moving there alone scared even tho it won’t be for awhile
Everybody wants to rule the world? I already love this channel 🥺
Exciting, from PopBoomPop
You know how hard it is for people who are born and raised there to leave when they want to, it’s like trying to leave Jim Jones’ cult in Guyana
Im moving to alaska
I love this!
OMG WHEN 1D CAME ON MY HEART SHOOK STOP IM CRYING-😫😭
yoooo her laugh is hilariousssss
this is the coolest thing ever.
I don’t know if you realize this but you are putting your descendants in a difficult situation when you decide to permanently settle in Hawaii like how you are in this video, this is what I am experiencing right now. It’s not a nice position to be in.
You shouldn’t be there too long
The 1 thousand people that disliked this video are just jelous!!!!
Some mac miller in that playlist brings me joy
Every places have a beautiful room when I turn 14 I’ll make a video of going to Paris actually Hawaii
Colonizer
Super cute
Hannah pls don’t when there are natives homeless
this is so cute also the music rly got me 🥺
Who else went back to this video after catching up on all the vlogs? It’s like rewatching the pilot episode of a show you got super into lol
why is this making me cry. i wanna move so bad
woohoo!! yay for you!
"supposed to be a sad part of the video" GOODBYE BEAUTIFUL COFFEE MACHINE.
Oooo what airline is that? 👀♥️
Okay colonizer
i’m proud of you for moving but please be respectful of the island and the people.
Not me literally balling my eyes out because of the one direction music
1:28 who is that on her lock wallpaper
I have loved Hawaii for the longest time and I plan to move there when I’m older! (I’m a child.) See you there someday!
WOW. Why did I cry over night changes?? It was zayns verse too😭😭
who knew this video would lead to your relationship with dean and perfect friend group.
I've decided to move to Hawaii next tax return. I'm so excited
i was literally eating a banana when you said smell a banana 😂
where are the little packing bags from
I was definitely not mentally prepared for night changed to play
I wasn’t ready for Night Changes🥺
whenever I watch this vid I always feel an inspiration idk why so thank u so much Hannah✨
This is pissing me off! I’m from Hawaii and people from the mainland chose to be disrespectful to the people who were there first! I know that you aren’t disrespectful and have a safe trip❤️
NIGHT CHANGES IM CRYING
I was not ready for night changes to begin to play!
DUDE WHAT A DREAM
We no care if you come down hea just now dirty our aina k denz be safe

Good  luck with living in Hawaii. I have a lot of memories of it.
lol i hope i make it in 4 years
ew
i've been putting off watching ur hawaii videos for months now bc i'm so jealous of u and now i'm forcing myself to watch them and manifest this life for me
Anyone else cry as soon as Night Changes started?
It would be nice for you as an influencer to shed some light on the history of Hawaii instead of just illustrating this false narrative that Hawaii is a place of paradise instead of the genocide it really is
I subscribed as soon as I heard night changes
EASTERN IS GREAT
I wasn’t prepared for night changes😭
5:09 Evas laugh is so funny ( i thought it was my life as eva)
I remember when I used to live in Hawaii.
i wasnt ready for night changes
Do you ever miss your boyfriend???
I wish I had something interesting like this going on in my life 🥺
Where in the GR area were you from?
this is actually so wholesome, proud of uuuu!!!!
9:32 that laugh
not the night changes in the back. i love 1D 😭💖
THE RESPECT I HAD FOR YOU WHEN NIGHT CHANGES STARTED PLAYING
I’m crying moving Volgs always makes me cry🥺
me watching this getting all the flashbacks of when i lived there
Safest way possible would be not going so
I wish i had the power to move to hawaii in 13 minutes.
Ahhhh why is this making me emotional yet so happy
I love your vlog!!! And the soundtrack, ouuuu
OMG I SAW U CAUSE I LIVE IN HAWAII
i’m visiting when i’m 13 :)
HAHA the random surfer boy is loudawg on insta!! he dated Claire Michelle the celery and rosé girl a few years ago lmao
why do me like that with the music
If anyone is moving here (Hawaii) please don't pick fights with the locals, by locals I mean the Hawaiians, and Just be respectful Also, thanks Hannah for being respectful

i was like : I know that night changes intro ANYWHERE
when night changes started playing.. i was not ready for that
NIGHT CHANGES MADE ME SOB. -AN EXTREME DIRECTIONER
Was anyone just jamming to one direction? OR WAS IT JUST ME?!
1:40 WHEN THE SONG STARTED PLAYING I CRIED
oh my gosh when night changes started to play i cried like sobbed.
So happy for you!!! Also love the music choices
one direction. triggering
can influencers pls stop moving to hawaii like they own the place
i’m so confused why didn’t she quarantine when she got to avas house?
such nostolgia watching these vlogs since I did the same thing 3 months ago now. Hawaii is amazing enjoy<333
💕
i’ll pretend to be jacob. “i”
The editing int this video *chefs kiss*
night changes made it sad for some reason
U LITERALLY SHOWED MY HOUSE!! RIGHT ACROSS LIKOS AHAH
I always pray before takeoff too!!
this made me miss airports sm
SHOP ALO MOANA
I SCREAMED WHEN NIGHT CHANGES STARTED PLAYING
She added the 1d music ahhh
did she say her reason for going to hawaii? maybe i missed it
omg period
i saw my apartment when you were over kailua/lanikai lol
Next time you put one songs warn me pleaseeee
1:29 omg when night changes started playing I was like 😦😦😦😦😦😦🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I love you videos girly. What are the blue pants from anthropology called I'm obsessed with them.
watching this made me cry because i know i’m gonna be doing this in a few years and idk if i’m ready haha
i bet it’s a podcast ... and if so i’m screaming
i 💛 u
wait this is amazing and made me emotional
everyone’s talking about night changes but when “give me love” played for 5 seconds.. i felt that 🥺
love you!
Watched this video, and I’m super surprised why it’s so popular. It’s seems like a normal high school girl moving with shitty music. Anybody got so more realistic and adult expectations for moving to Hawaii?
liked this video solely for night changes by one direction in the background.
i was really jamming to night changes😁😁😁 the directioner in me freaked out
IM IN OAHU RN
STOP IVE BEEN IN HAWAII FOR A WEEK
1 week ago? 😨Hope you doing well ❤️
what's your starbucks drink name?
why did this make me cry though
No we cannot switch the language I was enjoying the one direction 😤
does anyone know where her over the shoulder black and white tote bag is from ? ✨🌙
im literally so happy for her
i loved this sooo much!!!!!
me from eastern europe: omg, in Hawaii everything is still green 🥺 it looks like a summer, i want that first day with rain and wind and friends and UGH
I remember seeing a  tik tok taking about how you shouldn't move to Hawaii but who am I to judge
Night changes hit and I just got goosebump... the feelllas
amazing things to do! Get shave ice, A luau, take a drive around the island (it takes about 3 hours), Go to pear harbor, and go to the swap meet! There are sooo much for things bc those were my fav
wow when night changes started playing. i was not ready to hear that wow.
Where are her bags from
weren’t you a few months ago moving into your college dorm? lmao
1:29 that gave me severe flashbacks lmao *sigh* GOING OUT TONIGHT CHANGES INTO SOMETHING RED
me being 19 only doing college and retail work :( i wish this was my life lol
ava wearing the lillyann crewneck !!! :)
Ahhhhh great opening music choice 😇
not night changes 🥺 that hits too hard
adfddff one direction
Night changes song made the whole video emotional :(
Yes I wanted this to happen to you! I’m so excited for you and for the upcoming journey ahead!!!
SHEE PLAYED THE TOMMYINNIT MUSIC

hun i cried this whole video.
Wair wait WAIT, OAHU?! SO LIKE YOU COUKD GO SURF AT PIPELINE, IF YOU SURFFFFF
Y’all, she’s still young and still has a ton of life decisions to make! Just because she’s doing a ton of things in a short amount of time doesnt mean she’s “not ok”. Let her live and go on adventures to help her decide what she wants..
never thought i would be watching a video of someone else living my dream
God Bless your journey and you xx
wow hannah. im so happy for you, started CRYING bro, love you!! moving to hawaii is one of my biggest dreams!

i think it’s hilarious that she edits like everyone hates her but really everyone loves her
Your literally living my dream 😭💕💕
why’d the beginning when you were going to the airport and stuff make me emotional HA

THE FACT THAT I WAS JUST STARTING TO PLAN MY MOVING TO HONOLULU WHEN THE VIDEO came out 💓 let’s live our best lives in hawaii ✨✨ (even tho i’m moving in a year & half lol)
Gabbie Gonzalez from YT lives there. Maybe you guys going to be friends. She is a Teen mom i think she is 19 too.
the fact that a one direction song started playing (night changes)- I LOVE :) <3
We are a small couple's channel and we recently got engaged! We'd LOVE if some of you would check out some of our videos! We just posted HOW WE MET pt 2 | Backpacking Europe Together video! Comment some of your channels and we'd love to subscribe as well! xoxo, Iza & Tren

MY DOG'S NAME IS KOTA TOOOOOOOO <3
YAYAYAY but wb your boyfriend are you guys doing long distance
I cried when night changes came on
Everyone saying the vibes are off, please remember it's been a year since they've seen eachother. They don't have to act like how you think they should on camera. Please be respectful as Hannah is 19 and exploring the world. Sometimes people just need a change of scenery, which is what she did! She has also mentioned that she loves Hawaii and you should be happy for her.
This video was so well made!!
*me waiting for jacob to comment "i" several days later*
The music made this video
Ava literally looks like the girl version of Andrew Davilla.
Goodluck on your new journey, i know some times it will get tough and some days itll be smooth. It definitely is hard to move away from family so i wish you nothing but the best
This is a lil sad :(
I live in Hawaii!
Hey! Just wanted to say, I love this video! You’re a great editor and vlogger. This showed up on my recommended page the day before I catch a life changing flight to a new state by myself at the age of 18 so I thought it was appropriate to watch. I’m so excited for both of our new journeys!
I wish you would’ve filmed your family’s reaction that would have been so cute
omg when u played night changes by 1D i got chills and started crying ugh congrats btw ly
sign of the cross yes!!! :,)
I know how you feel I’m moving to Georgia with my mom, step dad, and half little sister and I, leaving my step siblings, dad, half brother and friends and family in ohio:(
Yass, great video 💯
hey han han, would just like to brag that we have the same birthday. luv you, and i am so proud of you

Can you do a video talking about your religion? Like if you believe in God, if you practice a certain religion? Im personally a christian and I just think its cool when people talk about that kinda stuff :)
Me as a 28 year old lady watching her call those “tank tops” 😳😐😶🙄😬
Repent, believe on the names of God and a Jesus, confess your sins to Jesus, and you can be saved from sin. Surrender to God and Jesus, give your all to God and Jesus, submit yourself to God and Jesus, talk to Jesus, listen to God and Jesus, read God’s word, spread God’s word, pray to Jesus and God everyday multiple times a day, live for God, glorify God and Jesus everyday, and you can inherit the kingdom of God.
me looking for the “i” comment
Oh mg god i thought this was click bait this is wild I’m so excited for you and jealous!! 🤩🤩❤️

Wow so nostalgic 😃😃
louis solo (3:48) while watching that view was something elseee

Hannah: moving to hawaii at 19 Me: still living at home at 20 and not knowing what to do with my life lol

I dont even know you and I got emotional during the airplane shots
Love the jams
BRUH I WANT TO MOVE TO HAWAII THATS LITERALLY MY DREAM
NOT NIGHT CHANGES😭
I hope she meets with Lexi Hidalgo!
night changes was literally so uncalled for there was no need for me to cry
THIS VIDEO WAS ACTUALLY SO GOOD I LOVED IT. was not ready for some 1D but i loved it!!!!
so does this mean more content with ava? i‘m here for it
the editing in this is SO good whatttttt!!!!
The beach boys surfing in USA killed me x
Wait i just saw avis going home to Hawaii video
Her videos have the BEST music!!!!
LMAO I LITERALLY ALMOST CRIED IT FELT LIKE I WAS MOVING WITH YOU
This video made me like nervous excited for u. All the feels
I WASNT READY FOR NIGHT CHANGES
YOUR EDITING IS SO FUNNY
STOP AS SOON AS 1D STARTED PLAYING I CRIED
NOT READY FOR NIGHT CHANGES. THAT SHIT CAME OUTTA NOWHERE
Okay wait what happened to college?
so close to 2 mil!
Ok y did I cry
Why did the song literally make me cry what
what's the song at the very beginning?
This video had me in tears with the music..
Who else knows where this airport is???
Night changes!
No way! I haven’t watched you in years and this just popped up on my feed.. right as I booked a one way to Oahu.. and right after another youtuber I follow decided to move to Hawaii.. I might be looking to far into this, but it’s divine timing ✨lol
this does seem abrupt but you guys have to remember she’s growing up and probably wants to truly start her own journey on her own :-)
Living through this video🥺
KINDA MADE ME EMOTIONAL WHEN THE NIGHT CHANGES STARTED PLAYING
not night changes making me emotional 🥺
Did she drop college ?
THE SONG THE ONE DIRECTION SONG STOP HAHA
im really proud of u <3
NO 1D. YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.
this video gave me such an icky feeling sadly! :( kinda like when you were at a sleepover when you were younger and just missed home and wanted to leave so bad in the middle of the night but you're trying your hardest to wanna stay
I am SO excited for this!! It feels like a whole new (but also nostalgic) era!!!!!!
the music tho....
This move seems very abrupt.. I just hope she’s ok and focusing on herself and her mental health..
just please make sure support us locals and respect us ❤️❤️
ofcourse she got some first class rich person stuff
OMG I LOVE YOU BRO WHEN NIGHT CHANGES CAME ON I CRIED SO HARD 😜
ugh if only i had the money to even fly on a plane like that 🥺 im 21, in college, and can’t even get a job that pays well😩😩😩 helpppppp 😂
i cant believe it congrats han ily
you’re freaking me out bc you already have Avas room layouttttttttt
Was not ready for the one direction
the amount of times she said “itty bitty” while doing the haul lol
pov you've been scrolling for ten minutes trying to find jacob's 'i"
U praying 🥺🥺❤️❤️
I like the music that she choose to add in this video. This is surely a very big step for her in her life. I am 36 years old and I still live where I grew up and that is in New York and in my father's house. Everyone choices a different path in their life and that is okay if it works for that person.
i littary just subed and now youre on 2millon subs congrats
I literally cried when I heard NIGHT CHANGES 😭
go smell a bannana ahaahah im dead
so excited for you!
Night changes will forever make me sad
What does Jacob think about you being gone for so long
why did i cry
Yes! Yes! Yes! Congrats 🥳 but you got some taste in music night changes!!! YES!
Hanna you look like Liam Thompson
STOP IM CRYING WITH YOU after watching your videos for so long its so crazyyyyy  to see you moving and becoming an adult
dude you don’t understand how much i needed the 2 of y’all’s content together it’s helping me so much ty.
Your almost at 2 Million subscribers!!

I WAS NOT READY FOR NIGHT CHANGES TO PLAY MY DIRECTIONER HEART IS HURTING
I moved to Oahu when I was 19 and regretfully left when I was 32. Best times.

I WANNA GO ON A PLANE SO BAD
Miss girl... it is time for therapy!!!!????? These have been such impulsive decisions
So happy for you! This made me so emotional because that is my dream!

NIGHT CHANGES IS MAKING ME CRYYYY
Who went to comments to see id he said ‘’I’’

the one direction song-
why did I almost cry...
Had to use one direction on me huh? 🥺
neighbors!!
I love the one direction song ITS MY FAVORITE
Me as a directioner: AHHH NIGHT CHANGES
i AM going to do this
I live in Oahu!!! Prayers of your journey
Why does this video seem so awkward😂 like their spark of friendship isn’t there🥺
My phone dropped on my face when night changes started playing
I was not prepared for night changes
It’s nice seeing not EVERY youtuber/tiktoker living in LA :)
its hard to see other people living your dream. anyways I'm excited to lie vicariously through you while im out here being a full time student and working 2 jobs all while freezing my ass off hahahah
for some reason i started crying in the beginning. I’m so happy for u!!💗
my respect went 📈📈📈 after she prayed
WHY AM I CRYING HANNAH
You know that Lexi is moving to Hawaii right

Another influencer moving to hawaii for the insta pictures and beach life when they don’t know about the value system of aloha, and Ohana that combines a strong Asian influence
Some thing embarrassing happens: Hannah: *cuts one direction song* But anyways Hawaii is also like home to me! But of course this year we can’t go, but it makes me happy to see that people are still doing adventurous things!
Well have a nice time in hawai!
I have thought about moving to Hawaii and this did not help... :(
wait isn't she in college?
Please Go on lots of hippy nature walks for me. 💨 🌿  That’s all I did when I was your age 10 years ago lol
What's going on??
the song choices>>>>>
Transition to the first clip Wait a sec that's  ;)
okay but why did this video make me so emotional  hannah you didn’t have to put night changes in this

NIGHT CHANGESSSS    I lost it when harry's voice came on

The thing that missing is Hannah clearly has bipolar. This is part of the manic stage. Remember when she moved to her apartment (manic stage) and then moved home after realising what she’s done. This is going to be the same.
the MUSIC
videos are too good
Go away hawaii doesnt need you
Last summer, I moved to Alaska for the duration. If you’re young, and in need of direction, go find it. Take an opportunity.
I was watching this like if there was something paranormal about to happen
when I heard night changes ...
Hey I live on Big Island! I love that Tears for Fears song so much! :)
I love ur vids so much
Ok.
not me crying for you bc i’m so excited for you ❤️
Okay why am I tearing up...that one direction really put us all in our feels, congrats though good luck with starting your new chapter you deserve the best!!!
IGNORANT HAOLE
I love the background music!! Totally unexpected but amazing:)
What’s the song at 6:26?!
Like I know from urban but is there a link
Where’d you get your swimsuit from
no cause i started crying hannah why night changes
hannah- you DID NOT need to hit me with night changes my emotional ass almost was bawling
this made me so emotional
*What kind of dog is Koda?*
i did this  in my younger years  it was the greatest for  one year.  then like a new relationship it where of and you get home sick wake up
Tears for fears 😉

POV: your looking for Jacob’s comment
Oh my gosh I cannot wait for the Hawaii vids
You have to collab with Gabbie Gonzalez!!
LMAO new age colonizers!! Don't forget to pack your smallpox blankies sweaty
this gives major colonizer vibes 🤨🤚🏽
living for the 1d
Girl forget Hawaii we going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀 gme
So excited for you
Why would you move to Hawaii that place is dangerous 🤫
Okay I live in Michigan too and I’ve been considering moving to Hawaii and switching over colleges from MSU to a college in Hawaii. Idk anyone out there tho
Matthew 5:2-48 [2]And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, [3]Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [4]Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. [5]Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. [6]Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. [7]Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. [8]Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. [9]Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. [10]Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [11]Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. [12]Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. [13]Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. [14]Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. [15]Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. [16]Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. [17]Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. [18]For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. [19]Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. [20]For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. [21]Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: [22]But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. [23]Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; [24]Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. [25]Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. [26]Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. [27]Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: [28]But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. [29]And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. [30]And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. [31]It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: [32]But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. [33]Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: [34]But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: [35]Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. [36]Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. [37]But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. [38]Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: [39]But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. [40]And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. [41]And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. [42]Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. [43]Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. [44]But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; [45]That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. [46]For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? [47]And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? [48]Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.,,
livin the dream hannah ❤️❤️❤️
So funny I moved to Hawaii at 19
CONGRATULATIONS
"2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. (Matthew 3:2 King James Version)" It can't be much longer. After all we've seen and heard, the time must be near. Repent ye! For the kingdom of Heaven is at hand!
stop go home please
stop
This was so inspiring like you can do anything and so can I
I loved the 1d song thank you.
girl we need an editing video. ur editing is amazing 🤩🤩🤩
TRENDINGGGG
imagine if influencers stopped moving to hawaii !!! would love to see that
SO HAPPY FOR YOU !!! WHAT AN ADVENTURE
i can’t wait to move to hawaii!!!
The fact that she played night changes makes me love her even more
ive been noticing hannah hasnt really been happy here, im kinda sad shes moving and idk why but i feel like things happened between her and jacob, not to be nosy!! i love you hannah and i hope your year starts getting better because you motivate me a lot and are always so positive, you deserve it!! LOVE YOU!
i love watching your videos but i hope you educated yourself about Hawaiʻis history before coming here. The Hawaiian kingdom was illegally occupied by America. Respect the land respect the natives you are a guest to our home
Who else is gonna miss Mere and Nolan in vlogs  :(
Hannah Meloche, Everybody Wants to Rule the World, Night Changes, and Hawaii. I love this.
OMG IM CRYINGGG IM SO HAPPY FOR HERRRR
You can live in the moment but you can't record it
night changes playing🥺
me looking to see if jacob commented "I" 🧐🧐
YOU SHOULD COME BACK TO LIKO'S. I AM THAT RANDOM GIRL WHO GOT A PHOTO WITH YALL :)
you had to play night changes, I started ugly crying.
night changes 😪💔
say hi to hyram for me pls
JOOHONEY
YOU SAID I'M moving to Hawaii at 19
how the fuck does this video have copyrighted music on it and ads
In the middle of a pandemonium?
congratulations this is huge 🤍 how exciting
Hawaii is a very garbage place to live in.
This video is so cute!!🥺🥺❤️
Night changes🥲
Congratulations Hannah. All the very best to you on your new journey.
The editing...you just KNOW hannah and ava were DYING AT THE EDITING I can't even help but hyperventilate over how funny this is
There is a weird vibe between you and her...
1st of all... follow ur dreams... thats it. Enjoy the sun... trust ur gut  #GETitGrrrl
girl i feel the same way about math as you do. i couldn't tell you how many times i cried about math
WOOO
how much do u wanna bet those itty bitty tank tops were 24 bucks each
I’m still reading through the comments looking for angry Hawaiians that want to discourage people from doing what she does. The hate here is real and being from USA becomes very obvious because everything in Hawaii is odd.
Jesus Christ loves you all so very much he died on the cross for our sins and was risen three days after so who so ever believes in him can go to heaven! ❤️✝️  We have to repent of our sins guys heaven is so worth it! ❤️
What plane did u two like jeez luv u
okay but where is avas beach bum sign from
I’m confused as to why she didn’t just move to be with her boyfriend but idk I’m not a long time viewer I just watch videos here and there every few months. I commend her though bc I’d be too scared to move that far out from family
im so happy for you ;)
the editing is immaculate
HANNHA I WANT TO LIVE YOURE LIFE AND DO COOL THINGS LIKE YOU UGHHH I WILL DO IT
What about Jacob🥺
Thanks for the slight comedic cuts ahaha. I would have been crying this whole entire video if it weren’t for those. Them nostalgic vibes are getting to me, especially when thinking about my future. I’m 19 as well and want to move, so I connect to this way too much
This video is seriously inspiring. Sometimes you just gotta take that leap... I connect to this so much, it makes me wanna tear up. I hope that one day I will have enough courage to take this leap as well
One Direction song 😍❤️
NIGHT CHANGES
lmfao wow, I actually was laughing throughout the video and honestly wishing and manifesting I will do the same one day, not to Hawaii but to my own happy place, and the vibes were just good to me and then I go to the comments and I’m just like oh wow ok 💀
subscribe
the night changes music made me so sad but i am so happy for you!
You'll be back soon.   Nobody can ever afford to stay.
Wait why is she moving got Hawaii
DONT COME PLEASE
Hi girly!  I was wondering if you could maybe show us how you were able to move too hawaii. I wanna live there as soon as i graduate but i know its hella expensive.
NIGHT CHANGES MAKING ME SOB
OMG WOWOW
So boring. Whats special about this person? How come anyone watches this? Thankful for fwd and 2x

Ava tricked us when she commented on Hannah’s sleeping video acting like they weren’t together 🤯🤯🤯
thank you for using night changes☺️
Hannah I was NOT prepared to cry. This video is incredible.
Hi Hannah, the hiking is pretty awesome on the big island. Hope you such best and many funs  P.s. dole plantation hawaii pineapple ice cream
This video really just made me cry. I’m moving to Australia later this year (if the border ever opens) and this gave me a sneak peak into what it will be like. There has to be nothing scarier than leaving your family and home indefinitely for the first time. I’m nervous and excited. Best of luck! I know it’ll be a great time :)
“night changes” made this vlog!!!
*me getting up & trying to shake my butt like ava*
Did anyone else sniff when she said smell that..I literally thought I was actually gonna smell it😂
This is so cliche
3:23 PURR like i know its not just me and my fam who does that. its a must.
I hope you have a better mental health state of mind this round. Enjoy Hawaii 💞
The music is making me cry
I live in hawaii
oh mt god I'm so excited for you can't wait to see everything is Hawaii💛
What about your apartment in GVU?
a video i never knew i needed
It’s not impressive given the fact everything is handed to her & she’s wealthy for no good reason lmao
why did i actually try to smell the banana
The living costs do be stupidly high tho
the night changes caught me off guard pov crying
what abt jacob ):
oml im ao happy for you, moving to hawaii has been my dream for so long!

Love the music choice in the beginning:)
You’ll last then a year with how much they charge there for everything
*night changes starts playing*....*starts to sob like a baby*
WHO CARES LOL

I moved to hawaii at 19 as well. 4 years later, its the best decision I made! Good luck!
i was NOT READY for night changes ms girl
9:40 LOL
the thumbnail makes me wonder how much you love the way you look in a mask, but will it be as much as you love living in a cage? you better wake up young sister
Hannah I'm not joking- as soon as night changes started playing I wanted to cryyyyy 😭 so happy for you ❤️
can y'all let her live? she doesn't need to tell us everything about her personal life. good luck with everything Hannah!
Mmmmm Hawaii. Meth is the primary drug and a 20% of people are homeless. Enjoy your free ride white privilege online college education.
I got to move to the moon at the age of 19
I do love the new change quite exciting if you ask me!! Gives me very much Donna Sheridan vibes. but WHO ELSE IS VERY CONFUSED AND INTRIGUED to what brought this decision I thought the caption was joking i thought it was like a get away/vacation thing and it’s actually like a long term thing ://
wait are you going with Lexi?!?
good job choosing 1d
Wish you a lot of luck with your move !!
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
Anywhere's better than Michigan
I live on the big island lol congrats and welcome to the 808 🤙🏽
Lot's of crack in Hawaii 😀
Night changes got me Soo emo
i was literally crying in the beginning of the video and then the happiest person in the end. This video is such a roller coaster.
I lived in Honolulu Hawaii briefly in 2016/2017,then moved to Alaska for a bit. Be sure to get the private invite from the Robinson Family to see those exclusive islands...I tip my Hat to all fellow Nomads out there...
the BEST soundtrack on a YouTube video EVER!!
Jesus Christ will return very soon. Please put your faith in him, and what he did on the cross. We, as humans, live in a sinful nature. We are sinners, but the good news is that Jesus Christ sacrificed himself so that our sins could be forgiven. The Gospel is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. Christ died for our sins, and on the third day, he rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven. Jesus loves and accepts everyone. It does not matter who you are or where you come from. He loves you, all you have to do is accept the GIFT that he provided for us. It's a gift that we do not earn ourselves. Not works, but through faith. Please get saved today.  Have a great day and remember that Jesus loves you; it does not matter who you are, he loves you. Maybe to help lift up someone else's day, you could spread this positive message around! Have a nice day!
How is this trending? Its all rap minecraft and whatever these vids are now on trending. Thats sad
Omg and then 1D I just can’t 😍
WHY WOULD YOU DO ME LIKE THAT I WAS NOT READY FOR ONE DIRECTION TO START
I'm starting to think I should sell drugs

I'm giving her a month before she feels homesick, two months until she makes a video discussing whether she should move back or not.
Oahu is dope I love it here
OMG I’M SO EXCITED, HAWAII 🏝
Didn’t have to use night changes like that, literally sitting here CRYING my eyes out
That's my life goal💙
Taking a shit at 21
Ahhh I love this and so so happy for you!!
y’all talking about one direction in the background but what ab that ed sheeran 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Who cares
It’s the white people moving to Hawaii and fucking up the real culture for me
She looks like michele lopez
Please do not come here
Aww they’ve been friends for so long
i’ve watched you for years hannah and i am so proud of you. love you hannah <3
my heart skipped a beat when I saw the title but I’m so happy for u!
13:35 tell me why that song reminds me of 50 first dates😂
uh she’s livin all of my dreams rn
this video made me wanna cry what
I love Hannah, but I'm worried about her. This can't be the whole story--she's not telling us something. There has to be a real reason why she decided to move...I honestly doubt that she just did this out of spontaneity. She did mention that her 2021 had been toxic so far, and I noticed that she was spending a lot of time at her dad's. I'd hate to draw conclusions, but I'm beginning to think that her relationship with her mom has gone south again. Maybe they need to be apart for a while and do some soul-searching on their own. Whatever the case is, Ava must be a really good friend to let Hannah move in with her. Not that she has to, but I hope Hannah will do some explaining when she's ready. <3
Is that business class you are flying? 🤑
this video Is making me do good in school so I can live this life
I got so emotional watching this video. This is the REALEST content I've seen and I appreciate it so much! Being able to see the unedited parts and what life really looks like just is so encouraging to watch knowing that we all have our awkward moments and  we all have our personal dreams to accomplish no matter where we are in life or who we are!! I am so excited to watch your journey continue Hannah and am so happy for you

Hannah is 20 soon - she’s growing & changing all the time (completely normal). Don’t be too judgemental of her choices about where she lives or who she surrounds herself with. She will live & learn & make mistakes & have changing relationships & make great memories (like the rest of us) 🤎

she is literally living the dream omg-
I
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15

Me searching for Jacobs comment lol
I love the emotional music when giving Ava her gifts!!
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
why is this making me emotional
not another colonizer 😭😭😭
When you are also from MI and doing a temporary stay in Hawaii
one direction and plane flight made me emotional lol
Literally just watched a night changes cover before this vid so I was lowkey confused but  ugh the song made this vid so much better! plus it suits ur moving vloggg
WE NEED MORE OF HANNAH OMG
Why is this garbage on YouTube?
Sis i was crying why did u play night changes
https://youtu.be/Q9R.-yXXXwC8 Wisdom Follow Jesus Christ, he rose from the dead! Obey him before its too late. He is the only way to get to the Father John 14:6 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Hebrews 5:9 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Hebrews 12:14 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Proverbs 28:13!
Welcome to the island:)

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)!
( *Romans 2:4* ) "Don’t you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can’t you see that his *Kindness* is intended to turn you from your sin?"  ❎ It's *Not* the Wrath of God that leads you to repentance. ❎ It's *Not* the Judgement of God that leads you to repentance. ❎ It's *Not* Hell or pain or fire. ❎ It's *Not* the punishment. ❎ It's *Not* his anger.  *romans 2:4* ☑ "It's the *kindness/goodness* of God that leads you to repentance."  ☑ God *Is Not* waiting to judge you.  ☑ God *Is Not* waiting to condemn you. ☑ God *Is* waiting to *receive you* with mercy, with love, with open arms.  ☑ *Jesus took* the Hell, the Judgement, the Punishment, the Wrath, the Pain, the Sentence that we deserved on the cross. ☑ *"IT IS FINISHED"* Forgiven Once For All. † ☑ Only *Blood* can *Forgive.* Asking forgiveness has *never* forgiven anyone. ☑ Without the *shedding of blood,* there is no *forgiveness* of sins. ☑ The *Blood of Jesus* Was *shed* on the *cross.* In the Old Testament, they use *animals blood* & *sacrifices.* In the New Testament a *spotless lamb* was shed *for all.* ☑ *REPENT* — means to *turn around,* to *change* your mind, change your path, *align* your belief, turn from. *Change.* ☑ God made him who had no sin(Jesus) *to be sin for us,* so that in him we might become the *righteousness of God.* ☑ Jesus *takes away* the sins of the *world.* ☑ There is *no separation* between You and God, because of *JESUS.* The *veil* of the temple was *torn* in two. ☑ We have *Full Access* to the Father. ☑ God *Is Not* mad or angry at you and *will never* be. ☑ God *Will Not* punish you ever if you *sinned* or did something *bad.* Look to the *cross.* Jesus took the *Punishment.* He took it all away.

The God who created *the world and everyone* in it. The God who saw what *he made* and it was good. The God who saw *Adam and Eve* fall into sin, and the God who sees everything you *do, think, and say* every moment of every day. ☑ God Endures.

Instead, *you should* fear God. WHY? Because God holds your *entire story* in his hands. And not just your story here on earth. God is the one who ultimately decides *where* you will spend eternity. But while you fear God, you can also *trust in his Son, Jesus Christ, who died* to forgive you of all the mistakes you make here on earth. On that day when you face God, Jesus *intercedes on your behalf* and reminds *your heavenly Father* that those sins were *wiped away with his sacrifice* on the cross. ☑ Jesus Is *Coming Soon* ☑ Before the *Foundation/Creation* of the World, *God knew you, God loved you, God chose you* ☑ God has the hairs of your head *numbered.* Every moment of your life is *watched by God* ☑ God *knows.* He knows your *past, future, sins, words, heart, thoughts, pain, worries,* everything about you.

So happy you’re going to beautiful Hawaii! Please be safe 🤍 and we would love a behind the scenes video about how this move came out. It seems very random and I know you said the beginning of this year was difficult for you.
Congratulations on your move Hannah!!!
Hawaii is stunning, all of the islands are, but it’s expensive AF. I hope you researched and knew that before moving...

Why did i actually try to smell it.....😗im not proud of that
“gentrifying hawaii at 19” whew
Just some advice from a local - if you move here, support LOCAL - we have some great mom & pop cafes/restaurants/etc and it’s so important that you help them over big corporations (like Starbucks), especially during these times.
I'm so proud of you Hannah!! I hope you make so many memories! It's so crazy that you and your friend Lexi both moved to Hawaii! Was that planned and will you be seeing each other?!

As someone who lives in Hawaii, please just be respectful, we usually don't like tourist because there the worst, but just PLEASE respect our prospects and rules.

My bff just moved to OAHU island and she had a 10 day mandatory quarantine when she arrived. Theyre really strict there, like jail time strict.  Im confused by this youtuber
night changes>>
why did I immediately start crying when night changes came on-
8:10 my dumbass pausing the video and looking up koda on youtube bc i thought he was a youtuber😑
Congrats your almost at 2 mil!!! I’ve been here since 20k!!! It feels like last week!!!
THAT'S AWESOME! I hope you find what you're looking for and a successful transition
I just can’t believe you’re doing this all by yourself all the way to Hawaii!
Congratulations Hannah this makes me so emotional I can’t believe how far you’ve come living through your dreams atm but hope I can do just as you did!
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10  9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!! Repent and turn from sin!! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out.
Hannah in Ava's room felt like when all the Disney shows would combine for a special episode .... https://youtu.be/-qzpn-DIuRA
my eyes went so wide when i heard the intro to night changes
so happy for you!!!
niall and louis' voice during the montage is so comforting

5:03 for a moment I thought Ava was literally going to pull up in that shuttle bus HAHAHAHA
I wasn’t ready for 1D to start playing so now I’m crying in the car while my family gives me weird looks.
night changes and bulletproof got me singing at the top of my lungs 🤩✨
People leave their living situations in college literally ALL the time.  Subleasing is totally normal and easy thing to do. People move to other states, ALL the time. Especially if they don’t have to attend physical classes.
lol I like the California song cali is the best.
literally almost CRIED when the night changes came on
my co-dependent self could never be that far away from my boyfriend
hi:)

Hannah was ut raining hard last night it was for me in oahu
Look out for the heavy toxoplasmosis on the beach , 300k+ ferral cats , many different horrible effects on humans
I have like no friends and I just feel like picking up and moving to Seattle
the directioners have been summoned
K, whatever makes u happy , and you look really happy,  I'm happy for u

Why??? Is she movinggggg?????
what about your apartment with your roommates? are you just leaving it like that? you just got that for one semester? so confused
Ok but like why has she been 19 for like five years
not me crying through the whole video for no reason. ahhhh ily Hannah
im crying this WILL be me someday. I claim it.
The natives will love be you.......
Trivia Question: What celebrity has their dog cloned– twice?

Born n raised on oahu!! Makes me homesick I moved to the mainland last year 🥺💚
im so jealous

Hannah was the one asking what should they do at the end
okay but does anyone else think they were so awkward together?
You should go to Surfers Coffee in Wahiawa!!
I’m so happy for you 💗💗 congrats !
Last time I watched Hannah she was moving into her apartment for college. Hmmm

Good luck. Hawaii is expensive, and hard to find a job. Good luck
Night changes.... i mean, as if i could’t love her more
imagine not listening to the natives of Hawaii begging ppl not to move or vacation rn. beyond out of touch, selfish, privileged, colonizer behavior.
I’m from the big island. Just moved to Texas almost a year ago. Might go back though 🤷🏼‍♀️
i was not ready for night changes to start playing
Hannah I'm so proud of you for getting the courage to do this big step all on your own.
Where is your purple set from? I know it’s from free people but what’s it called?
I’m going to miss the family vlogs🤧
this video made my day! i have been wanting to go to Hawaii so bad and this video gave me so much hope for the future. love you and ava so much! now going to watch avas vid :)

I wonder how her boyfriend feels about this, I’m sure he’s so happy for her and he loves her but I’m sure this is really hard for them
i don’t know why but i feel like that ava and hannah aren’t very close like they seem kind of awkward together if you compared it to how she acts with ellie
Ppl move to LA and then hannah yeet we going to hawaiiiii babyyyyyyyyy
i wish i had this life
when you make your long distance even a longer long distance relationship
2018 vibes
the awkwardness i love it
This is so exciting!!!! I'll just be living vicariously through you for the foreseeable!! <3
Is anyone else really sad she won't make good winter content anymore? Like I don't live in a hot place, I liked it that Hannah was in a cold place too
when she features a one direction song

Miss girl imma need some more details
Not me crying bec I think she’s moving (even though I’ve never met her)  but happy for her but so invested in her life but don’t know what’s going on... I need some answers lol
Me, a different Kayla, watching this: 👁👄👁
omg!!! can you please write in what airbnb you're staying at???
What about Jacob
I love Ava !!! Her laugh
I am so excited and proud for you. This makes me so emo
This is so cool Hannah!!!!!
Why is this making me cry
this bout to BLOW up
YED YES HANNAH ! ❤️❤️❤️
I am so happy to see that you are here in my home state ❤️
She is a great YouTube that shares a lot of her life on social media. This sudden change may or may not be because of something that’s happened. Even if something did happen she has the right to keep it private. We really don’t know what’s happening so it’s best to leave it be. However it’s totally normal for her to share it as well.
the editing is sooo good omg "chefs kiss" >3
Not me literally screaming when night changes starts playing :)
where are those packing cubes from?
im so proud of you Hannah!!!💗💗
NIGHT CHANGES🥰
I LOVED this video it made my day editing and songs phenomenal!! Love you Hannah and Ava❤️😆
Where is that white shirt from that your wearing when your showing us the clothes you bought?
night changes playing in the back caught me SO OFF GUARD
i feel like they constantly broke the 4th wall
I love this for you🥺 I want to know more q and a video??? So so many questions wth! Also I slept while playing your 7 hour video
THE WAY NIGHT CHANGES STARTED PLAYING
omg what’s the song at the very end?!
I’m confused I thought it’s expensive to live in Hawaii 🌺
Kinda feel bad for Jacob. “I’m moving to hawaii, idk when I’ll be back”
Night Changes is really about to make me sob
OMG watching Hannah in ava's room?? I'm soo excited😭🤩
What about college Hannah? Online? ;)
Who else got nostalgic when ‘Night Changes’ started playing 🥺
God I miss Oahu sm
kinda concerned 🥺 glad you’re with ava tho!!!!
The 1D in the background
Are moving to Hawaii temporarily or permanently?
I deadass started crying when Night Changes played 💀
Why am I crying?
So happy but v worried about her since she wasn’t able to emotionally handle living alone not that long ago let alone another state hope she’s okay 🥺
Tell me why I started to tear up when one d started to play
„Go smell a banana“😂😂
We love two best friends who just love life and are good people 💕
i can’t believe we’re in hawaii at the same time
lmao I really want to do this but I don't have any friends in Hawaii :((((
the SEROTONIN i got from this video. UNMATCHED
ok woah night changes triggered my flight or fight
HANNAH!! this is so exciting!! Hawaii with you and ava is so vibey! i cannot wait to see all the vids!!
I felt like I was traveling with you 🥺💕
why did i get chills & start to tear when night changes started playing
How’d she use night changes without getting copyrighted wth
I’m not sure if it was the music or the fact that you’ve been a huge part in how I’ve grown up but this made me cry a lot. I hope you have the best time in Hawaii Hannah!!
idk if I'm more obsessed with the one direction or the awkward editing
Wow how much I wish I could do this at 17 right now
The hello Oahu transition was AWESOME 😆💙 Good luck Hannah!
Felt like something bad really happened to her she looks genuinely upset. I hope her stay at Hawaii will heal her
I’ve watched you for so long and watching you live your dreams is so inspiring and I aspire to have the same goals soon❤️
Hannah’s out here living my dream😭😻
Oh my I love one direction best video ever

I had to pause and emotionally collect myself as soon as Night Changes started playing.
Hannah, you are someone I inspire to be able to move countries just like that 🤩 I would’ve cried so much saying ‘see ya later’ to my family 😩❤️ I hope this will be me one day!!! 🥰
Congrats I love the queen 👑
when night changes started playing i got SO sad for some reason omfg

Aw her and the goodbyes
STOPPPPPP HAWAII thats soo frickin cooolll

omg the one direction caught me so off guard😂😂😂
so excited for you hannah wishing the best for you❤️❤️
I felt so peace in my heart when she played 1D music 🥺❤
music choice making me emoshy
Why are people questioning why she’s doing this? Cause she felt like it. You only live once
hannah: “i’m following all the guidelines” also hannah: *doesn’t quarantine after going on a flight from michigan to hawaii*
can we get some type of explanation I have so many questions
Oh this just makes me want to make a huge life change, move to a different city and vlog the whole process!
You live one of the most gifted lives.
MY DREAMMMMM

miss hannah you cannot just play a one direction song without warning
this has to be clickbait? expecting a trip back home soon, BUT WISH THE ABSOLUTE BEST FOR YOU❤️❤️

YOU CANT JUST START PLAYING ONE DIRECTION AND EXPECT US TO BE OKAY
Did you record your goodbyes to your friends and family???!?

I want to move to Hawaii too but I've been educated on the whole native ppl being pushed out . I'm not white but I'm also not native to Hawaii so I don't want for my presence to hurt others. Idk it feels like although I'd be living my dream it'd be at the cost of others.
WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE😭
I wish I could be this spontaneous
The one direction are you KIDDING I am not okay
DIRECTIONERS WHERE ARE YALL!! hannah + one direction... my two favorite things.

Please educate yourself about the problems Native Hawaiians and the islands are facing and speak up about them.
I am so excited for you! (and the new content with Ava🤩)

Congrats Hannah! So excited for your new chapter in your life and the new videos to come out! Enjoy it you deserve the best in HAWAII!’
The fact that u sat in seat 8D is a good sign bc its a smiley face
I love how you pray before you takeoff so sweet
I LOVE YOU FOR PLAYING NIGHT CHANGES OMG

JACOB WATCHING THIS 🙄
i dont think i've ever been this excited for someone!!
~main character vibez~
what about ur bf like is he coming to hawaii or is he staying
i am so excited and happy for you !!!!!!!! i cried about 4 times watching this idk i just got such a rush of serotonin and dopamine and all the happy chemicals it's just so amazing watching you grow and the adventures that have unfolded for you, it's also worth saying it takes courage and bravery to do this Hannah and you should be proud of yourself and keep trusting the process cause it'll all end up being more magical than you can imagine when you follow your heart and intuition x ps. you and Ava are the dream team i didn't know i needed to see!
Is lexi moving with you?
SO EXCITED FOR YOUUUUUUU! Praying u have the best time of ur life
omg im so Hannah when Ava and Hannah were having that quiet convo at the end lol. Like i give ideas on what to do and im carefree about it and then Ava’s just like “idk”
ACTUALLLLY YAAAAAASSSSSSS honestly what a queen
So happy for you🤗 all the best❤️
Night Changes makes this video 1000x better!!!
now u need to collab with @Hyram
PLS TELL ME LEX HIDALGO IS ALSO GOING TO HAWAII WITH YOU

You guys are so cute
sounds exciting!!!!! good luck in hawaii, hannah <3
OMG !!! Best wishes.
the stories she's gonna tell her kids
I appreciate u keeping in the parts that were kind of awkward- it’s more authentic, YouTubers are always cutting things out acting like every single conversation always flows perfectly!
So i guess this mean no more vids with nolan? :(
screamed when you started playing 1d HAHAHA not normal
So so excited for you!!
Thats crazy!! I love how u edited in the music! wow

anybody else tearing up🥲🥲
i'm so insanely excited
Are you and Jacob still staying together?
dang you move to hawaii right when I move from there 🥲 CONGRATS THO!!!
Why did i get emotional with all the music in this video😂💀🥺
ahh alohaa !! please be safe and respect our safety rules 💜
pls pls pls do not push out locals like so many people do when they flock to hawaii🤎🤎 the homeless problems are really bad because of mass gentrification
what she gets to spend time with koda luckkkyyy
I’m so proud of her, this is amazing 🥲💞
I think something happened with her roommates because she said at the beginning of the year she had some toxic things happening.there has to be more to her just up and moving across the country. I really hope she can give a explanation and real life update
Aloha Hannah! Welcome to Hawaii hope you like it here! I did seem to notice you praying and I love the faith you have for Christ! But if you have just one more step and live for Christ and expand your relationship with him would be awesome 🙈
gurlll you are soo pretty and inspiring!!!!
Hannah girl I hope you find what you seem to be so desperately looking for 💜 for real, this video gave me depression vibes
I hope that they are going to do a starlite collab
what about her boyfriend lol
Literally the cutest ever
me being on an exchange year seeing this lol
This video make me so happy
Didn’t Caityln Rae do this and regret it
NOT 1D PLAYING  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH
does anyone else feel like there friendship is a bit awkward this time round idk - maybe its just the first day and they obvs havent seen each other in ages so they might of forgotten how to act
This video. Made me SO HAPPY I LOVE U BOTH
This Is genuinely like my dream
OMG NO WAY! this is so cool
are u shipping meredith there????🥺
I am literally so obsessed that two of my absolute favorite YouTubers are living together! Love you Hannah and Ava! Much love!!!
THIS IS SO EXCITING!!
Great background song 😘
This video made me so happy
why did this actually made me cry ... like i've always wanted to move to hawaii or a far away place but i don't have the money and i need to finish school and it feels like i'm running out of time and i wish i could just pack my things and start a new life but i can't and oh man seeing others live your dream is so bitter sweet :( i'm so happy for you though and especially excited for all the vlogs. maybe if i ever make it out of here i can casually say hi to y'all on the streets of hawaii lol
i love this video and immaculate song choice btw ;)
Ava to the camera: “smell that” Me: actually tries to smell
wait where did you get those long light blue pants from again?
In a week she’ll post a video back at home saying how she missed her friends and family

6:35 OMG THAT SMELL SO GOOD  Im honoured to be apart of the conversation
Omg
I loveeee that she prayed 🥺🥺🥺it’s sad to say, but there’s few people who even believe in God lately. Also, never to late to repent and turn away from your sin, if anything that’s why he died for you ♥️

I am inspired in 6 years when im an adult, im moving to hawaii and bring my friends. College can wait, or i can just go to college in hawaii

Ava’s laugh while she pulled up in the car 😂
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
im literally crying, i just wanna pack my shit and move away but i have to finish my last year of school first
AAHAHHHHHHHHH IM SO EXCITED FOR HER NEW LIFE CHAPTER OMG
