As an American, I gave the us the win, but only by a little. Both countries had great ones, but there were one or two of the uk’s that I didn’t get, and there were one or two the the us’s that I preferred. Moral of the story is, they’re geared towards the different cultures, but both are great 🙌
Simon: "I find it relatable like you pick up a box and shake but i also want to eat a hedgehog
1:33 who is this guy
6:02-6:08 why does that look like JJ after the filter🤣
Buist
6:06   Bro got the ksi special
Some usa ones went over his head for instance the homie one went way over his head
6:07 If JJ did this 🤣🤣
I call racism
i think your biased
is it just me but did simon turn into randolph at 14:44
This vid was a ding dang do a proper skranit
it took me a year to realize how based simon is
also how did that girl not know steven had a sister like i know this happens but i am confused i guess they never met but maybe steven should have told her he has a sister
when the coke tis probably whats causing that girls acid reflex given i used to have it too until i gave up certain unhealthy things lol
Rigged, USA had no shot lol
in Australia their called prawns not shrimp
I’d say 10-11
Shmush
This ting Ik
As an Australian I can confirm that the only time I have seen a kangaroo, a spider, and a crocodile in my life has only been in a zoo. Along with a peacock ❤️❤️
I’m Aussie
Vines and memes are better
B:8 USA:11
Simon: i don't get it...   Me *on the floor crying*
UK definatly won the car roll up one! Good choice yoy did good judging !
I mean I understand but he’s being byest as fuck but your one of my favorite yourubers
Honestly, the British ones were the best. They're home-grown and funne just like the potatoes.
Nice Numbers
I still can't get over the "69!", it reminds me of when I got order number 66 and the way that the kids looked at me....
sorry mate that you cant come to australia, WHOULD YOU LIKE A BOH OF WAHER
tiktok is so cringy
i feel like us tiktokers are mainly dancers and uk are mainly random stuff
Why are Americans actually crying here, they’re videos relax
I live in Aussie I never see any of that shat
100% biased
Well all the best content is uk let’s be honest
2:48 to 3:00 killed me
”But at the same time i really wanna eat a hedgehogs
3:21 mason Greenwood 😳😳😳😳😳
BRO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING THIS IS SO BAISED ARE JUST DUMBASS AMERICANS WHO ARE JUST JELOUS BRO
The Hedgehog TikTok gets released and a few days later a news story gets released stating Hedgehog are near Extinction
the plot armor of the uk
I was going to be surprised if he actually wasn't biased, but my intentions of that were low.
"We've won it, but only jouist"
There are lots of hurt Americans in these comments
He was never gonna let the us win 💀
Love seeing the contrast in humor here. The thing is that you gotta understand British humor to get in on the TikToks, as I think it’s more subtle overall than some of the US ones. Not that deep overall, but I’d have given it to the US! Respect for refereeing though 🇺🇸🇬🇧
Definitely not biased video 😉
Am l the only 2022 comment
USA was supposed to win
that us one where the girl spoke in a deep voice bro most men speak in a deeper tone where am from and with no force plus am 13 nearly 14
Uk obvs win cuz we got binley mega chippy 😎
Idc what anyone says,there's something about a woman with a deep voice that 👌
14:30 that Harry’s distrack😂
i call bullshit! for the outcome.
2:47
We don’t him here anyone
I’m 11 and I beat her I have a lower  voice
the saying goodbye to the homies do be like that some times
It's not a duck, it's a goose
He chose the least funny Tik Tok videos for the uk
The UK tik toks we’re so relatable to Australia
Not gonna lie he kind of game the Netflix one
Bruh... Im from south africa and this list was f&%ked... Usa had that for sure
If manlikeisaac was on the vid he will carry the uk
Australians don't have shrimp on the barbie (I'm Australian) so I don't know where it came from.
He know the rules and so do we he's never gonna let US win even though he laughed  more on US ones
Let’s be honest I’m American but uk won and if no I should have been even
I have hedgehog no eating it
A kangaroo ran at me once me being Australian I punch it directly in the nose stare it down then run to put my shrimp on the barbie.
Naw that’s bias
Basically  USA:Shitty,cringy dance videos   UK:Actual funny memez
Now I want to eat a hedgehog
Rigged
“Now I want to eat a hedgehog”
For a video soon I think u should do bored button on google 😄😄
13:18 that is why Ksi is into simon
Ur corrupt
I feel like this video was JUST a bit bias
Simon can't help laughing to the cringy American tiktoks give him a break.
Peepee30p0
Bro was rlly on the ground for the US one “aw i think ill give it a draw”
Brother on that is embarrassing that is is embarrassing
14:29 I don’t think Simon realised that the tune was of w2s’s diss track
Bruh can u do Australia and UK
uk obviously
Is everyone ok
Rip
it ended at fifteen b
Biased scoring.
all those sea creatures at 11:50 are at the deepest parts of the ocean
UK>US
11:15 As a British individual: We do not open up our windows and say your welcome....it's more polite finger gestures and national greetings...
Realistically the UK ones were  ones that either had UK in the name or had an English accent but the American ones were just literally anything
Mid child in my family  favourite
UK all the way
That last 'Uk' one was actually Irish
12:30 *EMOTIONAL DAMAGE*
IT HAS TO BE 🇬🇧
USA clearly won he was never gonna let the US win 💀
I've only seen 3.65 videos more biased than this
Biased
so polite 10:50
The British are much better than Americans
I’ve had to come watch this again the ginger guy doing the making call us topnotch but TikTok’s you can now do ten minute videos it’s turning into YouTube 🤣
He’s a scam
Australia wins 💪
I think us won personally
At 6:06 that was obviously just KSI
Not biased at all 😂.
He is a little biased for the USA TikToks, I guess he just doesn't like the USA winning for once it's always UK all the way lmfao
At 13:10 that’s a stolen meme by the way, diddnt originate from shittok
14:19 the oooo got me
bro i live in australia
US it better
Ok so I am American and just wanted to say the last 3 or so tic toks he made ties knowing America got those 2 points should have been a tie
Im sorry but the UK is the definition of Banta the US can have the dancing but no country will ever beat the UK when it comes to being funny
GET REKT WANKERS
People in the USA is just making me look bad
Should do against Australian tik toks
England for sure because we don’t show our bunda
uk 100%
11:04 ive always wanted to do that
next is Australia v UK
i swear every time he chose the US i screamed TRAITOR 😂😂
We’re not talking about YouTube because US is on top 🇺🇸
Cmon give it for england
This was so bias😂😂
Bias much?
Nah I feel like it was a little bias, no chance he would have let US win.
The us u would not win
I ain’t proud of my country
Biased
Part 2
U need to do a uk vr Australia
Hi yaaaaaaaaa
The one about Australian the only thing I have to say is HOW THE HELL DOES LAZERBEAM LIVE THERE
Us won
can u do Australian vs uk toktoks??
Uk
Bias
I just want to eat a hedgehog?!
8:28 AHHAHAA
6:02 LMFAO
Faveritism
U cant say u choose it bc it relates when u live in the UK😂its more relatable to u
I would call it a tie
I didn't find any of the Uk ones funny, but I guess I can't relate to any of them
US is better at everything .except education main stream….  Ya we better MERICA 🇺🇸
UK
"you know what I relate to that and now I wanna eat a hedgehog......" miniminter.       8:09
6:31 do be looking like ksi ngl
“I’ll pick the one that is most relatable” He lives in the UK! Bias like
UK TikTok is the best
4:04 pop smoke's voice was deeper than that but hey. Great content   RIP Pop Smoke 2 years since he's passing
anyone here after jack joseph blew up ansd went on whats good
5:57
Asian dads when you say that you don't want to be a doctor or engineer: 13:15
The UK win
uk
I'm seeing a lot of bias here 😂
It’s okay if the US didn’t win.After being up 13 colonies and still manage to lose the UK can have the win on this.
2 of US's were banger, but u gave them a draw, there should be a whole draw, both were bangers.
he spell tasty wrong tastey
Whoever gathered the videos for him got the cringy Charlie d’smellio tiktokers and the fact he was enjoying the American ones more but he always gave it to the uk lol
Ffs Simon we have nados ..  U guys think america dont understand a lot of UK things bit a lot of us do..
He's not doing this again 😆
uk getting the W again can we do Australia vs UK tik tons
simon just about died after that brothers girlfriend one 12:29
If anyone sees this listen to this 13:13 with your eyes closed
uk is just better
i noticed early on he was giving US credit where credit was due....  but after checking how many vids... things turned around abit.  i was agreeing up till the last 2..... no way the facemask is winning from a guy copying a girly wink and has to slap his eyball back from going crooked. and the last one would be a definite tie..... parents waking you up before 12 after a night out is in the same wheelhouse as that sibling or any other member of the house making a mess of the bathroom no matter how many times you mention it.
Neither, I vote neither. Tiktok sucks and is just toxic.  (i'm bound to get a comment that says my opinion doesn't matter or nobody asked me xD)
The UK ones sucked I’m not gonna lie
As someone who is neither from the Uk or US i tend to find the US ones funnier
UK for the win!!!!!🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
your rating Simon is ... dogshit, USA won ez   im Swedish btw  (ps. don't want to destroy randys dreams but he's not funny i would pay to NOT watch him.)
I wonder why u relate to the uk I wonder why
UK 🇬🇧  has the comedy US have the dances
uk 100%
the draws should have been US ngl
Who is better? Depends on whether you like bad content or not. If Yes US content is good.
ÜK ÜBER
rigged
A
11 us 9 uk
ok but i love this
i think there might be a little bias here
bias
US won 100%
People basically just need to submit the man acting like a roadman for the UKs side and we win. Easy W.
7:08   I don't think Simon understands how accurate that is as an American 🤣  We deadass do this for some weird reason
I've patted a kangaroo pussys
No man ....randy one was unfair....US was more funny
us is better and you know it
The problem is that he does not understand American humor British people or anyone from the United kingdom understand American humor it makes sense
I’m so disappointed in my country I wish I was uk myself
I’m Australia and I only get bitten by like 69 spiders a day
now that you look at it miniminter looks bare hot
Last few minutes man was dieing from the American tiktok. Its a draw
Half of these were ass and didn’t deserve points for either
Uk 🇬🇧 is way better
12:30 is insane
Yeah Randy!!!
2:11 that kangaroo can beat ksi in a fight
I think Ozzie tick tocks are the best
UK is a billion times better.🇬🇧
I went to school with ollie ball last year
UK 3 U.S. 17
At 13:19 ksi be like 👁👅👁🦻
I love you Simon and I love uk youtubers but in this video i gotta say the real winner is USA.
Oml y'all American people are salty.
these yanks are rlly salty in the comments m8, what have you done simon, you've got a bunch of yanks crying in the comments now 🤣🤣🤣
Bruh man talking bout Australia but puts a photo of an alligator😤
The last one is so relatable because I have 2 siblings
God bless spread the gospel
7:20 Relatable
The is no link
The third us one is so relatable
do australia vs uk
mad biased lol
Tbh US actually won majority of these. Simon is probably biased to his home nation. 😂
What Simon says uk tiktok is: only good comedy What Simon says us tiktok is: Basically Bryce hall. And the cringe "dancers"
US is good but UK has randolf😆
He picked like the worst us ones possible
Real fax: UK - 9   US - 10
Very biased
Lol u can win tik tok but not a war L
video proves that people from the us have better senses of humor. another reason, funniest shows where they come from? us. south park best show and i’m pretty sure all writers are us( totally could be wrong there) and i’m not insulting a place or whatever just backing mines
Hello there
You answered it in 10 seconds
Simon: now I wanna try a hedgehog Me who has just seen a hedgehog: DON'T WORRY BUDDY I'LL PROTECT YOU!
US and the UK should have drawed. I think the US was better though
Honestly, The UK can have it.  Nothing good ever came from TikTok lol.
bias
Just because you live in the uk and its relatable doesn't mean its better
usa people malding they lost lul
3:45 is very relateable with my girl bsf...
Okay okay. Let's be honest, you all were rooting for your own country right....                     USA wya?             I hope there's no fighting between countries!
Hello, I am testifying of Andrew Kelvin on how he changed my financial status for good. little did I know that Bitcoin can elevate me, though I was never poor but my investment with him really increased my portfolio and I can't stay and watch people get scammed daily. salaries pays my bills but investing with him made me financially stabled, I will always testify of her good works
I'm a middle child as well and i get treated like that also I was born and raised in England essex
Biased af lmao
Uk all the way
I have a higher voice than that girl
The maniacal composition briefly request because comparison comparatively kill mid a far rabbi. uninterested, highfalutin paper
Uk best place in EU
All the Americans salty bc uk won 🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂
This man literally giggles at the uk ones and dies laughing on the floor and then gets back up breathing heavily and says ill call it a draw
Talia POV 13:17
USA tiktok is way better lets be realistic, i like the UK and all, but USA tiktok is just way more creative. obvious bias here simon, but is all good
UK is better. Know why cause Bryce hall isnt UK
It’s totally bias
The one about getting out of the shower is so true
He is definitely being biast but I'm not from UK or US. I'm irish
......music......GOODAFTERNOON.  hey thats harry ❤️ Minter:- i dont care
You have to watch majin carp tik tok compilation
us definitely won those to ties
1:20 what's the link for this on tiktok I wanna see it
So your gonna show some of the US's funniest and best tiktoks but no Inthedark roadmen tiktoks, bruh
the US people salty as hell lmaooo
USA
14:19
6:39
6:04
2:48
do Australia
US ruined tiktok
Bias
At 13:58 Baltimore niggas
Hey mate, I am Australian and it is not that bad mate but we do have the most buffed kangaroos mate.
us was waaaay better
Nah, lemme say it now, the croc in the picture at 1:19 is Shazza, the spider at 1:57 is Jack, and the kangaroo at 2:08 is Psycho Bob, other than Bob the rest are fine. Bob will square up tho
No oppence to the usa but we kind of thrashed the USA in my Opinion
13:11 *insert ksimon joke here*
Uk are more funnier but US are better at the dancing
RULE BRITANNIA
The worst feeling is when you need to burps but it just stays right in between the chest and neck area, (FYI Dr Pepper is the best solution for that problem, for me at least)
For once he was not buyest
💜💜💜💜
He should've gotten a German to judge because they would hate UK and USA equally for...reasons...  Pls dont cancel me it was a joke.
I have an actual score because I’ve lived in both places and the score was 17 to 4 with the u.s winning
lads
Did he really just wretch and hide in his jumper because of a picture of a fish??
I’ve never seen a spider bigger than 2 thumbs in the over 10 years I’ve been in Australia’s
Biased
I AM PAKISTANI AND AS A NUTRUAL US WINS
ollie ball fell off hard
UK is the best
lol bias much
No usa better
Am I the only one who thinks he’s biased because he definitely is.
Bias
the bias lmfaooo
The old lady being slapped isn't a tiktok, it's just an old vine
im british but i feel like simon was biased lmfao
What about Aussie’s we not important enough ayy
2.00 mins this spider is not true
Simon hella bies
6:02 he looked like KSI a few years Ago
Hey
the thumbnail looks like simons just seen jj
you stole two points from the america
Plot twist Simon is the middle child and he is the least loved...
This was bullshit
Every time he chose the US  I was like you were the chosen Simon
Uk Comedy is better
These comments are hella weird, Simona literally voted fairly, the 69 video wins any day it’s just a must
7:20 relatable 😭🤣🤣
good afternoon your mom looks like kim jong un
The girl with the deep voice: I sound like popsmoke  Me: You dare challenge me
You should react to mexican tik toks!
14:32 Harry's disstrack
BIASED
But round one us
Uk of course
Who tf even luvs the us
Conclusion: Tik Tok is shite
Tbh I think Simon was a bit generous to the US tiktoks
Australia aint that bad unless you live up in northern territory or high up in queensland, I live in melbourne and i dont come across crocs or spiders like that and the kangaroos are the same.
How can Simon judge when he’s literally from the UK and lives in the UK I mean some of it was fair but come on now
I ranked 11-9 (UK-US)  Edit: I counted wrong lol
Had to been some weird ass text for her to mistaken her somebody else besides his sis.😂😂
Uk
Australians dont  put shrimp on the Barrbie
13:26 bruh
13:18 wtf is that sound Simon
I'm from the US but UK is God xD
The zany sausage greely pack because overcoat morphometrically realise out a sick canvas. earthy, actually request
She sounds the same
10:23 is that willne
Literally anytime he thought they were both weak, he picked UK. The US never had a shot.
I'm from the UK but USA won this. Simon bro WTF??
No offence simon but you gave the point to randy only because he is your friend, bro the other one was banger
Bruh this nigga rigged this
The strange anthropology thessaly fix because hole phytogeographically drop astride a married environment. salty, nimble silica
Yo why is the comment section U.S. vs. U.K. arent we all "allies"     Thank you I'll be here all night
that kid looked like Bronnie james
U have no humor
That was soooooooooooo rigged
The duck one was US
we need a au pls
well that wasn't bias XD
Right it's the uk  We're great for a reason and its clearly not football
11:04 when I was in seventh grade, we had an end of the year assembly and we had this young science teacher who did the same exact thing.
Bruh randys was trash
9.36 the last zombie on cod:
New idea, Simon eats a hedgehog
I got 10 - 12 USA wins
Vote Randy 👌
Lol
Simon laughed more at US tik toks but gave it to the UK
I’d call that a draw
14:21
Simp
"I wanna eat a hedgehog" -simon 2021
I fucking hate Tik Tok...the song slaps tho    also the girl at 3:45 her "voice" the one that is deep is fake you can easily tell by her throat,you can see that their is stress on the throat which means she isn't using her voice properly it also doesn't help that her "deep" voice sounds like a child trying to act all tough.
All types of tiktoks can be cringe or bangin it doesn’t matter where they come from
The one girl with the voice change literally looks like the girl with glasses that had a huge crush on Timmy turner and fairly odd parents
uk
3:55 her voice is not deep at all wtf is she talking about🤣
A little bias mate
Rigged
cap USA won
13:15 that voice🤣😂
React to Australian tiktok!
Simon laughed harder at the U.S one and gabe the point to UK
The bias in this one was strong. I'm not from the uk nor america, but the usa one was better.
The whispering capital computationally wish because quiet correspondingly close round a earsplitting kilometer. knotty, supreme bowling
He’s being biased L Simon
Is Simon having a seizure? 13:12
-2:00
What about Australian TikToks?
"when your no ha senses let kick in at the wrong time"  Funniest one 🤣
At 1:51 the image says that it is an aligator not a crocodile. Im an Aussie and you have pissed me off
this was so biased lmao
He was playing favorites on most of them
goodnight minter not claiming anything just wanna say the lot of you in the sidemen like I watch all you guys videos every single night. I've grown to know you blokes and you guys are the friends or family that I need sometimes. love you bro and thank you sideman for inspiring me ro be a better person
8:29
React to bigbagofpotatoes
I love how all the Americans are here saying its biased coz he picked uk lol. You just have to live in Britain to understand
Bruh the fact that he gave it to his own country on some dead ones where US was better wasn't very pogchamp if I do say so myself. The Randolph one wasn't funny at all but he only gave it to the UK all because it was Randolph
At the end simon was just straight biased cuz we all know the last 3-4 were bangers for the US.
UK Tik Toks are usually OK with some bad and some extremely good.   US Tik Toks are either super cringe or super good. Hardly any in between.
I can relate to the middle child
NONONO SIMON UR MAD BIASED 😂😂😂😂 YOU WANTED TO SCORE THE US LITERALLY EVERYTIME U SAID IT WAS CLOSE OR A DRAW
oh yeah
Bro could this be any more biased lol. As an American. I really hate the stereotypical distaste that almost all British people have against us. Be it we are all stupid, or just the general dislike, know it goes on both sides, but It does make me sad how much everyone in the sidemen seems to genuinely dislike Americans. Yall have a TON of US fans trust me, we don't get enough love :(
Ollie ball would faking drop Bryce hall in a fight
UK tiktok is better, all cause of Charlie and Dixie ruining my US :(( sorry if you hate me, but they are overrated as heck
American 8yr olds getting mad LMAO
uk tik tok is better no question about it 🤚🏽
4:06  Talia:I've seen enough bullshit
Completely biased
US Tik Tok video is so funny and talented
Im from london but i feel u only picked uk cause u live in it most the usa videos were much better...
U.S kinda sucks though xd
I had US winning 7-11 lol it’s because that guy who talked about Australia and jumping into water was dead to me.
USA win
Irish tiktok s are the best
the 3rd video in the US side was legit stolen, that didn't even originate on tiktok or probably even the US
Why y’all UK ppl gotta make it competitive god damn bruh it’s just opinion 😂
"but at the same time now I want to eat a hedgehog" - Simon Minter, 2021
lets all be honest we knew that the woman with the coke didnt burp just did noises that sounded like a burp
Where were all the roadmen TikToks I was waiting the whole video to see them but they never came
Gun oh sorry I mean America
Rip Steven's Girlfriend
Mate it's the answer the great British are the best
Romans 12:9 - 10 9 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 10 Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.
What about Jamaican tik toks
Tbh those were some of the worst US tik toks I’ve ever seen
UK seems better
Uk
just my opinion 1. uk 2. uk 3. uk 4. us 5. us 6. uk 7. us 8. us (both weak) 9. uk  10. us (sorry randolph) (both good) 11. uk 12. us 13. uk 14. us 15. us 16. uk 17. us 18. us 19. us 20. us (both weak)  uk- 8 us-12  just my opinion
Half of the stuff in the ocean that man was scared abt are very deep into the ocean
The best one was the one about Her Brother Steven's Girlfriend
I think this is a bit bias and someone for somewhere else should do this
1:30
It’s olllie balll here
I live in USA but UK was funnier to me
Maybe a non-UK person should do this
Bias
has usa ever won in these vids
Bruh, USA won you just being patriotic 😂
Even though I’m American the British tiktoks were funnier
the americans in the comments prove how seriously they take their tik toks
Ok so I have a couple of questions... Why did he say there were 15 at the beginning but as soon as America started winning he said 20 after that at the end he only showed 18 or 19 because uk was winning????🤔
Stevens sister lowkey cute
.
The true winners are Indian tiktoks
UK ones were straight up trash...... ✌
Simon you bias banana 🍌
yeah right that was random sheeeeeeeeeeeesh
13:12 Simon literally dying
react to Callum.Grant7
The end was so BIASED XDDDDD get outta here Simon
Nandos is the UK version of Chick Fil A, or Popeyes
Mãe da Foca, Mãe da Foca, allez Se curtes de TikTok, és um ganda zé
i love you simon  but your forhead looks WHAM im the  thumbnail XD
Randys wasnt even funny and that american one was funny af and he really gave it to randy
Bruh whyd he keep giving it to the uk bruh the uk videos had me straight faces the whole time 😐😐😐😐😐
Lowkey uk tiktoks sucked
Uk better even tho I live in the US the US TikTok is just dancing
That’s not even deep😂 4:15
Who else is looking at the butthurt Americans in the comments?
tbh usa tiktoks are so cringe than uk tiktoks
Rigged
A banana is smooth that makes me want to eat a snake
fuck tequila herradura ads
AUS V UK PLEASE AUSTRALIA NO1
You could have chosen a football video from sammyd rather than that one
Bryce hall repping the US😭😭😂😂 so happy to not be American 😂
I’m us but Uk is better
You picked the worst uk til tok no wonder they were so bad
Right American ones are really funny to be honest, but I love the 69 one from Britain 😂
Bro how did the sister talking to the girlfriend not win. That literally wipe your mind of the one it was going against
Tiktok isn’t funny
The channel’s name is about games , while the content is 999 km away from games!
Racist
Tbh I’m from US and  think he was a lil bias tho
hows it aw english no fae the rest of the uk like scotland
Okay that was rigged the us won that for sure
UK cause they have real comedy and no fake bumboys doing weird dances to impress 13 year olds
Bro me crying Canada never gets in competitions like this
The thing i hate about the Australian one is that I live in Australia and i have never seen that spider in my life and, i have only seen a croc a few times and it was in a zoo not in the wild.
9:00 should have put the one where they shoot a gun and the brother says this is why mom doesn’t f ing love u
I don’t know I really didn’t laugh nor get any of the UK ones
Im from the USA and Ollie is the best  tik tok 😂😂
In my opinion I feel like the US was funnier but the uk so much more relatable
Do UK vs AUS tik toks
I'm waiting for other countries other han England in this video
No one: Simon: Now I wanna eat a hedgehog
Zw
Americans just have terrible humour
Based
I wonder what the score would be if he voted with the cameras off
Lol. We all know US won but fain enough Minter.
Most British ones were lacking thi
Most biased video ever 😭😭
Lmao we did year 9 vs year 11 and we had barely any touches but we were sweating so much
Saiman trying to make Tommy thumbnails👍
U used weak ass tiktoks,  u know damn well all the top creaters are in the US brah
Uk is the the best we will or ways win
Australia the best tho
As a Us citizen and as I fully respect you and what you do and you know your a great guy as far as I can tell but... HOW THE FLYING F*** DID YOU SAY THE UK WON HALF OF THOSE WERE POINTS TO THE USSSSAAAAAAA🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬!!!!!!!! Have a nice day bye😀
Well this wasn't biased at all 😑
Im from Australia and idc bro UK Tik Toks are wayyy more relatable and funny
For me, american TikToks are funnier in the moment, but once I’m done watching, that’s it, where as UK tiktoks, aren’t necessarily funnier, but more memorable and ‘quotable’, so their ‘funny-ness’ is longer lasting
I’m from the USA but USA tik toks are straight up trash so UK is better
I don't think Simons pure soul understood the hedgehog video
Imagine if he let us win this!
Lol who cares about tiktik let’s be honest here guys
Bro why are there pepole in the comments involving war
13:13 when you stub your toe
U.S. was better you’re just picking favorites but aye I get it they’re your friends you have to promote so no hate.
U.S should’ve won lmao

It’s 9 9 Bc he only picked Ik when it was randy
"I wanna eat a hedgehog"                                - Simon 2021
Simon be like, cant even remember the UK tictok... We will call it a draw.... like what hahaha. Then UK duck tictok,  no reaction,  then US he laughs.... we will call it a draw hahaha. Think the US won there haha
Nah bro the U.K. ones suck!! You’re just being biased!!
Ollie ball 🥰🥰
Bro you are so biasef
Simon is a weird guy
I feel bad for the hedgehogs that now have to make sure they don't get eaten by simon
“Now I wanna eat a hedgehog”   Everyone keep an eye on that one
I'm not from Uk or USA  But ollie ball is jokes😂
I didnt get the brother’s gf thing
simon do a breakup prank on talia
It’s funny looking at the comments and seeing some Americans having a sook because they lost in something which they believe is impossible
Ollie ball is so weird
The netflix tic toc was probably the best one
USA USA USA USA USA USA!...wasn't that good, UK definitely deserved the win
1:50 don’t mess with it then
I was waiting the whole time to see a tik tok of the guy who switches hotel workers, teachers for a roadmap
You need to react to Australian tik toks...
come on the gf calling sister gave you a real reaction and you drew this was rigged lmao
Lol, totally not biased at all.
Both UK and America both equally cringe
this is good UK tiktoks vs bad US tiktoks
I’m American but even Ik this also I’ve been supporting since KSI left the Sidemen
Do Australia next v UK
Where ollie ball??
The rollercoaster one had me ded
He gave last 2 draws so UK win😂the us ones were obviously better for the 2 draws
UK for the win
Why do you want to eat a hege hog bro
wait, you said you had 15 each which would mean when you got 15 votes done it was over.  At 15 the US was at 8 and the uk at 7.  The US won.
sadly americas.... they have karens of the world haha
somehow a Randy clip just happened to be in there.. and he won. Shocking... lol
Gowan Ollie Ball
Bro i wanna what name this kid is 14:30
Bro the guy with the lollipop reminds me of JJ
The US clearly won but hes biased
TikTok has become place for bunch of degenerates..
He wants UK to win😂
Bias as hell
better title: “reacting to two different types of cringe”
Bro Simons giving free points to the UK because he relates more obviously he will because they are from the UK
So bias
UK is better but I’m in US
Bruvv the us had way more bangers and 2 of the uk ones don’t even happen like the ocean that’s like seeing a shark in a meter of water not gonna happen
Uk banged it but hope schwing is too funny 🤣
2 draws. Bullshit
They are both horrible - it's tiktik - like vine; it's 99.9% horrible
4 brothers are 100% underrated
we have Simon on uk so we've won atomaticly
uk on top
Four brothers r the best
4:50 so relatable
The last uk one was actually Irish
I may look stupid but I dont get the one on 12:57
8:07 U WANNA EAT A... WTF MINTER
can u watch the alabama ones i can send u links iyw
Mostly all of the us ones were trash
I call CAP
Uk
Not gonna lie us clearly won that
Rigged
UK is better
I’m from uk
Where was the goat tra rags 😪
7:31 nah bro going to have to disagree with you on that one  8:40 and that’s biased bro 😂  This was scuffed lol
Y were some of the us is ones better
uk is defo better. a lot of us tiktok comes across as cringy.
Ngl the US has better you tubers besides the sidmen
Hi
fuck off some US were better XD
Bruh there was no Ollie ball
Not Simon picking out the smallest things just to give the point to🤣
GOOD AFTERNOON YOUR MUM LOOKS LIKE KIM JONG UN
3:45, why do I like her normal voice better like bruh, anyone else?
God it’s sad how bad the UK is in every category of every possible thing in life 😂😂
US tiktokers are the gayest people alive i mean grow a pair of balls lads
6:20 he got a point 8:32 I wanted to give Randy the point but I keep missing the bin as well LMAO
Visible effort really puts me off and makes me find them less funny
That last one was biased idc 😂
Americans are just funnier than British people, don't get me wrong British are funny as well
You picked the worst us ones
Bias
u did the one with girlfriend talks with bf's sister wrong..it was clearly usa who won it
He was too bias
Every time the USA should have won he gave it a draw 💀
I feel like u were too biased. If the british video made u laugh, even tho the usa video was a banger, u would still give it to the british video
14:03 i think he was deaf or could barley hear
I’m hearing a biased opinion
Ngl American people on tik tok are absolute jokes bro said they got people doing cringe dances
People don't get the idea the scores a sub thing the main thing is reacting tbh, the scores are useless tbh.
This is so biased
Which is less worse
You chose uk the part where the the brother boyfriend is so muck funny
UK is better
This video is CAP The US def won that.
Do another one
He’s gotta look at some Australian TikToks!!
Ollie is not funny
I’m defo better mate
ITS OLLY BAAAAAALLLL HERE
10:14 one thing that you’ll never see in an American McDonald’s
13:16 I was waiting for JJ
Banger.
For uk you didn’t even add an Ollie ball or Jacob paski one
Petition for him to "React to YouTube Shorts Vs TikToks"
UK for the win American TikToks aren’t as good as uk tiktoks
Watch Pakistani/Indian you will need to bleach your eyes
One of them is Irish not UK smh
i mean was it really surprising?
Why is the majority of their posts reacting to tiktoks
simon so did not want the us to win and it was so obvious
honestly if it was up to me I would have put it either UK/8 US/10 or UK/9 US/9.
they both were good but i think its a tie i think randy lost
Us easily
Funny watching this from australia
Australia vs uk
Unsubsidized
*NOT BIASED*
Biased af
Bruh us got violated
do indian and asian tiktok challenge
The ocean one were all deep sea creatures that u will probably never see
Rigged he had to chose Randolph
Simon it’s tied up 6-6 next round goes To us after that goes to us (6-8) next round uk gets one (7-8) Simon- ALRIGHT ITS TIED UP INNIT
As a member of the american society, me and half of the Americans would like to apologize to all of the other countries for you guys to see what we do here and I'm so embarrassed to see the things we do here I'm just so sorry...
Why tiktok why not do a throw back to vine or something. Any thing but ticktok
people find the uk side funnier because it is way more relatable to them. I found the US funnier because i understood some of the jokes he didnt. imma be honest i have no idea wtf nandos is. its not in the US. as far as im concerned .
“But now I want to eat a hedgehog”   -Simon Minter 2021
I’m I lived in UK my whole life and the USA was way funnier
So much fucking adds on this video
Lots of bias in this video😂
Simon: if it’s relatable it’s good.     You literally from the UK
I knew it would be one sided. Of course it would. You cant relate to us things as much it’s common sense
It takes some time to get on the really good side of US tiktok. Once you get passed the dancing mediocre looking LA losers you have to get further away from straight white boy tiktok then you get the gold.
Bias much?
Baiest
I hate tic tac but honestly UK is better
still got the win where it counts boys 1776
I’m ashamed to be an American after watching this lmao
I want UK tiktok I’m disappointed in the USA
Sorry but y’all don’t get your spoons like that?
Look at the score in two rounds he keeps the same score just to let UK win
This has no relevance?
US !!!
Most of these were the wrong desion
He has a dad sense of humor now it’s kinda sad ngl
We all knew UK would win 🇬🇧
"Is it a football?" Is a classic
I have a strange sense of bias
1:10 Kung fu panda is that you?
US because the UK ones didn't even make me laugh
It’s Ollie ball here
Do Australia next
2:58 the owner of the TikTok account is now dead
I’ve seen the “Steven’s my brother” one before.... still physically pains me every time.
US had TRA RAGS
U lot are so pressed kmt just let the man have his opinion 💀🤦🏻‍♂️
You should have done UK vs Australia
Goddamn is Simon biased 😂😂
Me being the middle child its so relatible. We are underated.....
I think next time react to some other countries, not your own one because that ain't fair...
bias af
Happy BIRTHDAY TO. IT'S OLLIE BALL HERE
US wins
Please tell me I’m not the only one who hates Ollie ball
The sad part is that I’m 12 and in my primary school I was on the toilet and a pre prep child came under and said “Hi, how are you?” I was just shocked😂
UK ALL THE WAY LADSSSS 🇬🇧
When your in a good mood and you stub your toe and it ruins everything 13:12
I'm from UK
Bit rigged but Ight
UK
As an American I will graciously concede defeat here. American tiktok is cursed
When he said “the middle child is the least loved” I shed a few tears.
6:03 man transformed into KSI 😂😂😂
Scottish tiktoks is like finding a brand new ps5 in a dump. It’s amazing
Nahhhhhh without randy and Harry votes it was a draw.......
What’s the tick tok of the 2 people in the thumbnail
UK are better
The bias in the video holy but still great vid
nah nah bruh thats bs
4:00 my Best friend sound just like her
I think uk tiktoks and american tiktoks are very funny but you should watch dutch tiktoks there are also funny ones
Did I miss Ollie Ball or was that just insane good clickbaiting... tf!?
US had better ones on some that Simon chose it should had been a draw
US should of had 13-0 sweep just like the good ol days
bruh randy lost sorry no hate(btw)
Gotta do us vs mexico tiktoks my guy
U.S: everyone has a weird side  Simon a minute later: lying on the floor shouting ahhhhhh
“The list is fucked”
Uk is better
Up all the way
*Simon sort of liking a UK tik tok and then dying laughing at a US one* “ITS A DRAW!”
Ollie ball here
No no don’t eat the hedgehog
Biased af
Why did his answer take 15 mins i would of said uk in 15 seconds
simon: 'we got 15 uk vids and 15 us vids' also simon: 'scores 10-8'  math doesnt work out here xD
0:27 dont think simon got that cus he went to a private school lmao
Can we make this a series
Uk
Where did you get these clips? The majority of them aren't great
This man is milking tik tok 🤣🤣🤣
When Simon fake laughs so UK won
NDL
He who has ears to hear, let him hear  Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much the signs of the times are there and everywhere for all to see.  now is the day of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and Saviour understand that eternity is forever with no end no time God loves you so much but nothing is forced but the offer of salvation is there and the rejection of that is hell for all have sinned are guilty before the holy one the judge of all the living God   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23
Simon: *WhAt Is PeAcOcK?*
Simon: laughs more at US tik tok iMmA gIvE iT tO rAnDy
The USA was better it was close but the USA was better
The ancient Inca empire ate hedge hog
Bruh it was a tie, randy one didnt count, im pulling out the red card lads weve had a foul
UK better we have a YouTuber running to be head of our capitol city 😂🤣
Uk mate I am from there
for me tiktok gets a big 0
Simon we got robbed 💀💀😂 you robbed the US but FairPlay you’re repping UK
Compare UK to Aus
Bruh this was the most biased shii lmfaooo We all knew this was a bad video
🤡cringe
Bruh this was biased af
The handshake is not over going minter that’s literally how it is over here . You just don’t get it 😂👎
Tik toks aren’t even funny
POV: You're scrolling through the comments to see all the pressed Americans say 'let's be honest, he was never gonna let US win'
there was 2 lollipop and u skipped 1, nah i aint watchin more this sume bullshit
there are definitely better uk ones. do a part 2 with better ones lol
Honestly I think the UK TikTok’s were better than the US. Which is sad to say because I’m definitely American. Keep doing videos like this!
Most of the uk ones were the bad uk ones. Only legends know the power of good uk tiktoks. They’re soo funny
Ollie ball is a btec cc
Uk is best
pt2
react to india vs american
R.I.P roger
you did the uk dirty
Should’ve done UK vs Australia
3.35 its not an asda uniform or whatever its hugo boss shirt lmao
That was so unfair they put all the good American ones against the decent uk ones. I could think of so many better uk tiktoks
That girlfriend will not be apart of the family after that call lol
UK UK UK UK UK **** you usa 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
tiktok sucks admit it
Ollie bsll here 2k21
We don’t call prawns shrimps !!!!!! Ffs
Uk all the way
Australia is known for crocodiles not alligators, and I’ve lived here my entire life and never seen them outside a zoo soooooo haha. Also, that wolf spider with its babies 😍 🥰
BIASED! lol Uk was better - a US citizen, but only because i watch so much Sidemen content i understand the humor
randys was worse but sure lmao
The fact that the uk still won without an Ollie ball video
Sorry the 3rd video in the US side was legit stolen, that didn't even originate on tiktok or probably even the US
I finished 12 to 6 to the UK. guess its just the relatability xD
Why is oille ball funny
come on let’s be real. we all know that was rigged 😂
It's been confirmed, Simon is cheating on JJ with Randolph
Ollie Ball isnt funny/overrated
UK PEEPS WHERE U AT HEREEE
The rollercoaster vs Brother's girlfriend one should never have been a draw. UK should have had it over that fake ass call.
there was no shite us tiktok dances tho
Na this was in favor of uk but tbh I still think uk would’ve won it bc it had some bangers
i lowkey think it was a draw
Lol most biase video lol how about we get a Russian to do this
Ollie ball is the blandest human being
react to indian tiktok its poison
Unpopular opinion but ollie ball isn't funny
UK: Funny, banter US: Dancing and cringe
This is Tra Rags vs Ollie Ball and Shotgun Tra is levels so US
Thumbnails be outrageous 😂
Australia is the best
I had to click on this cause I saw Ollie ball😂😂😂it's Ollie ball here
Unpopular opinion: Randy’s tik tok was not better than the US one.
Uk is 100000000% better because they are not racist people in Uk are in peace no gun thanks very much UK 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧UK is a country of peace I am telling you this.
US won it overall in my opinion and most of these were not even close to the best TikToks
The US was better than the sucker one and the US was better than Randy’s I’m not finished but that’s what I’m thinking so far and maybe even the rolling up the window one
The 7 years brit kid vs american bullies tiktoks is the best where they at
I call bull shi... the last ones went to 🇺🇸
More pls of this vid
Who tf picked these? I can scroll through my fyp and find 1 better ones in 10 mins
Simon u can agree u just said this bc ur from the uk
Uk: it’s Ollie ball here  Us: *throws it back
This was riggeddd
I'd say neither is better because tiktok makes you worried for the future of the USA and UK.
Now you have to pit the winners of this against each other until you get the ultimate tik tok
biased voting
Do it again
i relate so hard to the throwing rubbish in the bin one.
Typical Simon score keeping, making it as even as possible
Bias wtf😂💀
It was 10-10 Simon wtf u can’t do America like that u know those 2 draws were clearly America won on them
Lmao he said overdoing it like if the bandos one wasnt stretched out and cringe
Simon man there was way better ones in the us side and he still picked UK 😐😐
12:12
Remember US vs UK with fangs on fifa? No.. just me? Ok
Canada is literally 40% American 40% British and 20% french were like the ultimate bridge
UK VS AUSSIE please and thankyou
Nah Simon that Randy one was bias
These were the shittest tiktoks for the uk. If you get on the proper side of UK tiktok they’re so much better than this
738047th
mad bias lol im not usa or britin and i think us won lol
Awfully easy to relate to the UK ones when you're, ya know... from the UK
Rule Britannia
I feel like UK is a bit jealous of USA. PS No offence
You have to react to jasonbankscomedy on tiktok he is goated
ollie ball and cal the dragon> any us tiktoker
Sorry just voicing my opinion but this ain’t funny
Lost the war lol
No one: US tiktok makes you forget the UK one.  Simon: I think it’s a draw.
7:00, little do you know, this is actually how it happens...
srry but ollie ball is so annoying now
When covid be done sidemen  1000 vs 100000 austrlaia holiday
i have my permit and once i get my license i’m getting my brothers car and my parents are getting him a new one and when my sister can drive she’s getting my moms 60k lexus like wtf
Like our comment no love no sub
Let s be honest here like 70% of the us tik toks were better than the uk ones
I am proud to be american but I love my uk people
what were those shitty US tiktok's what the fuck guys
uk to the wins
BIASED 🖐🏾I'm not American but everyone knows US tiktok is better💯
U.S men dancing is so cringe idk why
Funfact: the people on the left in the thumbnail were in the children news in the UK recently and our teacher pit it on and I died inside because it was hilarious and cringe at the same time
Some Americans think that the uk tik toks are terrible but that’s cause they can’t relate to them if they did relate to them everyone would know uk is better and the us will still say this comment is wrong
US are funny and all but Us UK have better humour
Liking the hockenheimring in the background of the Snapchat party guy
Us ones were so much better but Simon  won't agree
did anyone else notice that the smoke looking one was american At 5:57
Uk had some weak representation can’t lie
Ngl kinda biased
itsollieballhere
so fucking biased
I already know people are gonna be mad at this video. This is Simon's opinion. Got a problem with that? Make your own video.
WE THE UK WON
Not even a ollie ball tik tok
this was so bais lmaooo
Ngl, kinda bias even tho I love UK more
Ollie: UK sucks UK viewer: loser
U didn’t find the funny us ones
British won in the tik tok war  But who won in the revolutionary war please don’t hate for this
Biased
That wasn’t fair na na
British people tiktoks so much better
“What is a peacock” ???
BIAS you know us won AND I BRITISH (jokes lmao)
11.00 min- just for me
HAHAHHAHA IS IT A FOOTBALL??? I can sooooo relate 😂😂😂
Lol
Hahahhaha
Rigggggeddddddd
Let’s be honest USA will never win
I alreday submitted my idea Simon should make a new account on a  Xbox vs a friends and see who can get the most gamer score in 24 hours and whoever wins gets a series x Xbox and 1000 pound
Wow UK 🇬🇧 : D
Nice vid
The uk & USA are so different for content  👑👑👑
Black dude: Everybody has a weird side to them Simon 1 minute later: 13:13
I am literally from the UK
uk won them all and im not even from the uk
The world is fucked with all this tick Tok and social media
The Americans are so cringe
You didn't pick banger U.S ones
As a representative of the United States of America, The US definitely won.
the US should have won
bias asf
All i am seeing is simon preferring uk over us when some us tik was better. I hate tik tok and some i can give which is funnier because some uk i dont understand. Some us just made me chuckle. Which is because i understand it but was it good. No. Just get better tik tok
Team USA
2:48 had me laughing for 5 minutes!
Uk
UK definitely didnt win
Biased
An American definitely put this compilation together England has much better tiktoks then that
👉👈
Bro if it wasn’t someone who was able to be biased, like someone from Australia, then the score would be like 9-12
kinda biased. shouldve had an american with u
uk >
Simon minter had a cardiac arrest
This kind of video just shouldn’t be a thing. I hate you all who watch it
Should have been a tie. US deserved both the ties
11:18 wait a minute! He's on the wrong side!
8:40 NEPOTISM
13:19 *Simon starts moaning
Do u like hate the uk?😂
bro why have u gone back to once a week for henry theory, I'm pretty sure it doesn't take a week to wash ur jersey
We want streamer sim
He wasn’t gonna let US wins let’s be honest
you wanker randolphs tiktok lost that round and you know it
Simon just went it's relatable so I'm going uk like 10 times lol. Like you're from the UK obviously those will be relatable 😂
That’s not fair bc you got a lot of UK fans
C'mon we all know Lithuanian tiktokers are better
UK by a mile UK is funny, America is cringeworthy
Uk third round is so true I’m the middle
The real difference is their mum or mom are disappointed in them
Randolph just isn't funny
“But at the same time, now I want to eat a hedge hog” - Simon (Wedgeman) Minter
feel you should've got an independant judge from aussie land
Simon is so biased
so after the two draws it should be 11-9 for the UK bit since that doesnt really change anything because the UK is two points ahead in both i dont really care
Simon trying to keep his US subscribers
USA got robbed. Should won 9 and 10 but he gave them a draw
13-7 US
When you’re 13 and your voice still sounds deeper than her
uk
we need another
do more
TICK TOCK IS DEAD
No
Literally the 1% people who's reading,,, May you parents Live More Than 100 years with good health
I am neither uk nor us . But I feel like the us actually won this
@4:07 mhm sureeeeee Shes just “friendly” to you Simon😏 just call her cute homie
I think the US wins bc we got Trarags
The one where they pulled the chair out of the way eas british mot American
7-13 uk us. I live in UK as well but us ones were better
Worlds cringiest thumbnail award winner
17
before the video started i knew the UK already won
a bit rigged
Are u from uk??? I am
4:12 Simon make sure talia doesn't see this bit 🤣🤣
Tic toc is a horrendous peado ridden vile app that the young team don't seem to understand 🙄
Let's be honest he was never gonna let the USA win
Who else literally feels like YouTube is their best friend during Covid-19??
Even to this day I still haven’t downloaded tiktok 😂
Who else literally feels like YouTube is their best friend during Covid-19??..?.?
UK ones are dead bro you big simp
All I've learnt is American comedy is very slapstick and childish and the UK examples were terrible, I don't use tik tok so I hope that's not how they normally are, but Jesus come on man. I hope that was just bad examples, I was thinking of better jokes off the top of my head. And I know most other British people could as well.
He’s legit just giving it to the us to not sounds biased, the UK 1s were just so much better
rigged
Uk
UK BOYSSS
do aussie tiktok
I'm from neither, and 3 times where there were tik toks that were similar, Simon just gave it to UK cause he is from there. This video is bias.
I think  its a draw.
I love ❤️ fifa
do australia next
I love ❤️  you
Shouldve ended in a draw boii
i just spat the water out of my mouth 12:07
12:48 does she have 6 fingers I swear
If you're here watching Simon and feeling inspired then keep going grinding away! We are all in the same boat here looking for ways to help all our channels. keep up the good work and Never Give Up!
UK is the best 🙂
Can you play the uncharted and last of us franchise they’re all great games and I’d love to see you play it
Ollie ball hair
Simon: uk vs us Me: Aus
Subcontinent tik toks vs rest of the world
I feel like this was Bias
Streamer simulator nowwwwwwwwwwwwwww plssssssssssssssss
altough these british tiktoks you chose were fucking trash
American tiktoks are ass
He just gave it a draw until a good UK one came up
Simon there are some way better UK tiktoks, if anyone’s seen the fella who boots the footy in air then iykyk
Ollie Ball is not funny.
Uk for life  🇬🇧
Uk duh
Based on those I would say a draw. Loved both sides
the UK won but the clip in 2:47 was the best
UK is better because of ollie and scran it and also because we don't dance like uhhhh.... like that 0:14
This guy is literally the Karen of the sidemen
It’s Ollie ball here
Bruhh this is soo biased. I don't know. I'll give it a draw LOL
You are just biased bro. Those are just weakass tiktoks. US tiktoks are far far better than UK ones.
UK TIKTOK > US TIKTOK, change my mind
It’s Ollie ball here
Let’s be honest he was never gonna let the USA win. agreed!
Man tryna keep the scores competitive like his life depends on it 😂😂
4:14 that is so forced you can tell 😂
It’s Ollie ball here
Scottish tiktok >
lets be honest this was super biased and he wouldnt let us win
USA is better at tik tok but UK is better at YouTube
Okay. Australia has a few places where your gonna see a crocodile , spiders aren't that big unless your up north usually , well ... I live in a suburb in perth and I've only seen one big huntsman and that's it no big deal , also ... kangaroos aren't running through homes and shopping centres. So please come to Australia,  you just have to be smart about it. I would suggest visiting Queensland or perth in my opinion but one night when your sleeping... watch out for the drop bear..
uk
KSI : im sure i hear Simon and Talia .. The truth : Simon just react to Us tiktok 13:12 ✅
Ngl when you see Ollie ball in the thumbnail u know it’s gunna be good😂
🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
not given it to randy, would of made it a draw.
i like fortnitte
What bout canada
Hi
This is just Simon being a patriot for 15 minutes
Simon really scrapping the barrel huh.
He should react to South African tiktok. It's goated
As someone from the UK i have to say USA tik toks won
UK lost, every neutral person knows :)
Surely Australian tiktoks
UK are proper ding dang doo Defo scran it
He was biased lol
ollie ball is not funny wtf is this comment section smoking
As an Australian, I'm triggered. Around 2:00 the TikTok was complaining Australian wildlife and showed an alligator. AN ALLIGATOR!!! It was even in the search! WE GOT SALTWATER CROCODILES!!!!! Not shitty pissing gators
I loved US...But UK's tiktoks were good too I am not from UK..Love U bro❤❤
Rigged🤨🤔
both of the ties in my opinion the uk one wasnt even funny and the MCDs one was them saying a number it was just bais
bc of the draws it shouldve been 12-10
UK
14:45   Only joost? Spending too much time with Randy lad
The one against Randy was probably their best tiktok
Tbf I would have given the last  one to the us
Its biased
The only thing USA is good at is shooting up schools
USA actually do cringey TikTok but uk just do funny memes on it
Me: thinking Randy's Tiktoks aren't funny 👀
“ Only  joOst”  🤣
Bruh nah some uks where funny but the u.s where better
Surely UK vs AUS
UK🇬🇧
Man miniminter, how you have fallen
Uk. Cause they have a sense of humour
Simon could you add me on rocket league pls 🙏🙏🙏
Uk TikTok 💯 US 💩
inthedarkvlogs should have been on the UK
IDK why Ollie ball has clout
Man didnt even give us a point for the girl who got called out by her brothers girl. like cmon thats golden
JJ gonna try and say he would box that kangaroo tho
Worst vid ever ✌🏻
1:56 the way he says creepy crawly
Simon rigged it tbh
Bullshit. America was better
Ok but you chose the worst tiktoks from both sides 😂
yes ehiz is in the video what a king
Simon you simp, that is a goddamned goose not a duck!!!!
Not from US but i know he's biased
way to suck off the uk
I legit did that musical chairs thing in school i felt so bad 😂😂
The yanks doing tiktok are the defintion off a failed abortion
Simon after seeing this video i got a video idea 💡 how about you and talia or someone from the sideman react to someone call tra rags red shirt guy i think it be entertaining to see you react to his outrageous videos when he play as his character red shirt guy 😆
Roadman tiktoks are goated
Cant wait for every US subscriber to be like Of course he was gonna choose uk to win hes from the UK
Canada
you should start playing WWE again :D I was rewatching the wwe 2k16 videos for memories, and it was fun. You can do 8man in WWE 2K19 so all of the sidemen can play. I suggest don't buy 2k20 since it's hella buggy and everyone is saying it's trash (which it is) . doubt youll see this but yknow
Dam Simon looks like he is wearing biomass from rl 😂
Tbf, lots of the American ones were good but relatability took it for the uk
Randolph must have some sort of beaver in his family
I got commitment issues, I’m trying to fix that for you it’s Ollie ball hereeeee
12:19 “what happens if it was a draw”           (Ksi vs Logan Paul memories intensifies)
Yeah if we’re being real it was like 13-7 us
bruh simon you were  biased asf at the last, the last few americans tik toks were so much better then shity uk tik toks
UK wins
US by a mile.
I live in Australia and there is no spiders like that and I have patted a kangaroo there not scary and there is a thing called signs to say domt swim where there is crocs
Honestly just waiting for Simon to get a part 2 vid and just be mad pissed
No four brothers are the best tiktokers Simon how dare you Simon 😡
relatable
Favoured uk I mad lmao
3:58 As if Talia doesn't do that on a regular basis on stream and real life
The US tiktok is much more entertaining cuz there are many people and its a crazy place. Its the entertainment capital. Even their elections are more entertaining.
Can you please do UK v AUS
This was made for us interactions and I’m Canadian 🤣
now do canada vs australia
You should do Aussie Tik tok vs UK
As an American I can agree with this.
randy should not have won that one
Man the Netflix one was so much better than the duck one. I am Indian.
UK tiktok are only relatable in UK while US tiktok are kind of international
People actually used to eat hedgehogs
I’m in the us and the uk tiktok is way better cause it’s funny and not cringe like the gay us tiktokers
The UK bias is unreal
Bit biased innit
I bet you USA will win it next video - I'm calling it now :)
You rarely see kangaroo's, spiders are so small, crocodiles are only up north but there's some snakes, but that's occasionally. I'm from Brisbane in Australia
To bad them tiktokers don’t wanna fight a real boxers
I’m not even American and I think this was biased
This is fucking biased
Honestly think they’re equal
I think Australia won
Americans get more views and followers because they know the meta. Catch up
I call bs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You need to do UK versus Australia
Simon you’re waffling lad
If you had given those two draws to the US (which actually deserved it) then it would’ve tied overall 🤣
From an American I got to give it to the uk
react to austalian tik toks <3
deep down he knows that the us has won it
Even though both tiktoks were ass, the fact that Simon is from the UK meant that the US was gonna lose regardless
If this wasn’t biased the us would win by alot
Lol that’s me at 5:37 😂😂
do most viewed UK vs most viewed US
Pl3ase do this again btw can u react to deepest voices on the voice global mad stuff
react to INDIA V USA
He would never let the Americans win but the uk is best
LMFAOO
Did an American pick these clips or something? The UK ones were trash 😂
Do a part 2
bro you so biast though still jokes
Do australia verse uk
Simon Do UK v AUS tiktoks next
9:36 that was hella forced mate you can tell
I agree with all your decisions bro
That last US one is so relatable loll
It’s o o l l i e e b a l l here
You fraud
He gotta do this with Aussie tiktoks
Biasssss
U only watched the week ones
I feel like this would be more fair if someone was not from the Uk or the US and did this
Imma need an Aus vs UK real quick
Simon: laughs more at the US tiktok Also simon: gives it to randy
1.he’s biased,literally giving uk points when clearly USA was the one more funny  2.youtubers like this will be the reason for ww3 I bet LMAO
hey can u do australia vs uk or usa
BIASED
7-13
Me at the end of the video, “ BIASED!!!!!!”
lrets be honest if he was honest and voted for the US instead of making up Draws.. he would get chased back to Canada
i was waiting for ollie ball
you should do uk vs Australia
Lame haha us is better one lol
Homer.
I dont think u got the idea of the hedgehog simon
Uk
Yeah but who won the war...
Subtitle gang 💪
your thumbnails are so cringe lmao but i guess it worked
Bias! US all the way
simon...the americans won the war dammit
Bro this was so biast
8 UK -12 USA is my score.
uk vs aus
UK out here winning 56-55 it seems
Just the fact that it is this close with UK being the country he is related to shows that US is far superior if we take out out the concept of relatability
Wait I’ve never heard of TikTok?
You should do a UK TikTok vs Australian TikToks
All Canadians just vibing in the middle
13:20 Simon what are we hearing
The hand shake wasn’t over doing trust me it do be like that
Next time he needs to get on a call from an American and vote I feel it will be mire even
Simon u actually a t*at for that vid..the americans were much better  n u talkin shii with "draws" at the end? F*** off 🤦🏼‍♂️😂
Tbh this is not fair cus he from the 🇬🇧 and I’m America I guess people from the uk just have different taste
I'm from the UK but I live in the US rn, and yes, everyone is cringe
USA we got mr.beast
0:10 it’s Ollie ball here hahah
BIASED
can you do a UK vs Australia???
mer perdonas
US: I make the best tiktoks  UK:  Nah fam I do India: Pathetic
Simon be like  "This US tiktok is hilarious and the UK one was really weak.... UK wins this round."
Tiktok is just cringe in general
Us cringy
As an American, I'm just saying, some of those "American" tiktoks could be Canadian.
Simon literally enjoyed the USA tiktok so much he completely forgot the UK tiktok: "I think I have to give this one a draw"
Simon: Laughs at US tiktok, doesn't laugh at the UK tiktok. "I think i'm gonna have to give this one to the UK"
"random" tiktoks... His best friend and podcast cohost's tiktok is in it and W2S' distrack sound
This was the most rigged video ive ever watched lmao
i got clickbaited BADLY thinking simon was actually gna include Ollie Ball
So there’s no Caydsz in here for the UK, wow  He’s a guaranteed W for us
Biased
It’s Ollie Baaaal here to win
I think we can all agree half of these came from a weak ForYou page lol
before i watch this vid, i have a feeling he will just slag the US tiktokers tbh
I’m American and I thought the Americans were much funnier
Not gonna lie, this video is better than that main channel video Simon did with Talia.
3:51 from lilypichu to Corpse Husband 😂
US better you just picked uk cause your from there smh 🤦🏼‍♂️
Your telling me you didnt watch the one at 14:20 over and over just to hear that oooh
Simon be careful giving out draws while jjs in the other room
i live in Australia i have not seen one spider in my house for months, crocodiles don't roam the country freely, and i have NEVER seen a loose snake
Ollie ball isn't funny
you should do uk vs Australia tiktoks
He should do the Uk and Australia it would be a banger
13:15 Clapped noises by simon  Ayo JJ'S REDDIT USE IT CAREFULLY FAM
well done UK but i have to say it is just about the humour if you know what i mean
Guy at 6:05 low-key looks like JJ
BREXITTTTTTT
U know the kangaroo is actualy real and not a man is a suit. They're red kangaroos
I agreed with everything but Randolphs shouldn’t have won
Simon just didn’t understand the one where they were dapping each other up 5 times like I thought that’s how everyone was with their homies
lit ep.
These are just bad tik toks in general lmao
this was a sweep for me but i am from the us id say 14-6
Of course he’s gonna relate to the uk one. That’s a stupid reason to put in higher then the us
Draws should be illegal
simon is so biased lmfao
As an American who was born in America and living here for 14 yrs       UK tiktoks r SO BETTER
Fucking biased opinion but ok
Fakeee
This should be main chan
Could’ve posted on main
No tik toker is good
As someone from neither countries, I think the US ones were better
Alot of USA is weird fam🤣
As a American UK content is 1000% better than American content. In America content is either being hot or flexing how rich you are it so cringe. UK content is people actually being funny and genuine. Also people know what a joke is across the pond.
You will never catch an American so caught up on how America is better than UK like dude we all human..
I SWEAR ITS ONLY BRITHISH PEOPLE WHO COMPARE US TO UK.... USA DONT GIVE A FUCK WE DONT GOTTA KEEP COMPARING OURSELVES TO MAKE OUR LIVES MORE FUN
Rigged even tho I am uk
There was absolutely no way he was gonna let the US tiktoks win 😂
yeah he is so bias
I live in the us and I hate the people that do tik toks in the us   Uk for the win
We all know Australia is the real winner here
ITS COMING HOME
All of TikTwat is cringe tbfh fam💯
us u just picked worst ones
Def not biased
The shower one was so true
The last one that won was from a TikToker from Ireland
The reason US tic toks seem bad, because there is more people in the US that make vids compared to the people in the UK
do this video again or else
Nah man we all know if you didnt have relatable stuff with the UK the US has this
Use people are going to be like:"This guy is BIASED"
Biased as fuck😂
I'm not the only one who covered their phone for the spider one, right?
No one:  Simon: now I wanna eat a hedgehog   😂😂😂😂
this was never rlly a competition was Aahaha
4:38 the guy looked like Robertson.
Uk is miles better
Cap US won
How tf was not the roadmen teacher in the video
The UK Tiktoks were trash
U can’t pick randy cause he’s your mate that’s bull
Out of 15 (like Simon said in the beginning) the US won tbf
14:34 did he not realise that was Harry ..
The USA one to be honest but he related to more uk ones
Robbed
Ollie ball here
rigged
No hate but ion find the ollie dude funny
This was a whole pile of poo 💩
The only reason randolf won is because it’s randolf. That’s cheating. You know damn well that he should have lost that.
Bias towardss his countrh, but I think America humor is alot different then the UK
usa tik tok is so cringe
Canada: Eh? What Aboot Us
Do UK and Australia cause let me tell you Matt there are some funny ones out there you just have to look hard for the good ones once there was a fight with a kangaroo and one of the Australians in the outback
Last one had Harry's song and didnt even care but he see Randolph he act diff . SIMON DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF
I feel like the british tik toks were just about britain and british people whereas USA is literally just someone speaking in an american accent and doing whatever.
The list is fucked
America Frick yea
simon what about australian tik tok?
i sense favouritism
Close your eyes at 13:15 did not know jj where in the room
seanfitness Tik tok is irish not uk 😭😂
Last 1 was Irish
For me US takes the funny side of tiktok, ONLY funny side cause most of US tiktok is real cringe but UK tiktok is so funny because its so relatable
how u gonna diss the homie one
Do the UK vs Australian Tiktoks. Then it would be a real competition
Do UK VS Ireland TikTok next
We got lil baby
So no one in the entire world has realised the exact same thing as me, the fact that almost every single UK tiktok u see is something “relatable”? It’s either “roadman” based or maybe “school” based or just “UK people” based? Always.
What if inthedarkvlogs was in this video
Every american tik toker is gay
Eh USA got Charli and Addison so don’t matter
Uk 🇬🇧 Yup Yup 🐐
👃:bias
6:32 KSI's forehead be like
do UK v australia
Simon casually trying to do the maths to make it a tie breaker at the end throughout the whole video
Bro I've never gone to nandos but I really need to.
Uk undefeated when Ollie Ball is on there side
Simon biased af lol
As a person who gets US and UK tiktoks on my fyp these ones suck
Biased
nah, US should have won, respectfully
britain 3 - 16 U.S.  british people ain't funny
he should make this a series
Back to back TikTok videos.
You need to get American 🇺🇸 to be with you cuz you only voting for 🇬🇧
This isn’t fair he’s only picking UK because he can relate bro no one no one wants to hear him say I’m a give it to the UK because it’s Randy cause it’s his best friend how is how is that fair get Toby there he’ll be more fair than Simon
The fact I live in the uk and thought most of these weren’t relatable...the US should’ve won
YES NOLIMITSMEDIA 😂😂
Easy to compare the UK has Ollie Ball Jacob CaltheDragon whereas America has a bunch of wannabe Jake Paul’s like Bryce Hall
rigged.
Guy flips off camera vs a broken spoon by ice cream 1 was funny the other gave someone epilepsy & wins smh then bias wins as well
he’s mad biased, i fr find the UK ones so bad 🤣
As an American the videos representing the U.S. were trash
UK TikTok is gonna win. 1. It’s Simon hes English and 2. it’s just better
I love how all the comments are UK is better because almost all of his audience is in the UK😂
You should do Australia vs US
Just waiting for the funny black creator vids😐
those might have been the worst tiktoks ive ever seen
Sooo biases 😂😂😂 America got fucked on a few rounds
I'm from the US and I only watch UK YouTubers. I don't use TikTok but if I did I probably wouldn't watch any of the clowns from the states anyway. People from the UK are much more genuine and more entertaining
USA USA USA!!!  (Love both)
I’m American and I agree British tik toks are better😂
ok ok ok ok let us get one thing straight here.  Bryce hall, Addison rea, and the hype house don't rep America at all.
The one with the brother got me screaming of laughter
Not going to be rude but i feel like the same thing would've happened if an american was doing this  American would let the americans win and the Britissshh would've let the britisssh tiktoks win
1:48 i live in australia this ain’t true but it’s hilarious
This cap, 1-17 US wins
If he eats a hedgehog I’m unsubbing
You wont see this but just incase. Could you please do scottish v english tiktokd
Simon really tryna make it even and stuff but also not biased was enjoyable to watch ngl.
7 - 13 for me but yea
Can we pls just have a 1 hour episode of streamer simulator everyday
There’s much better U.S TikToks you haven’t seen
Good thing The sidemen are patriotic and proud to be from the UK. Just like any citizen, should be proud from their own country in some way. 🇺🇸 🤝 🇬🇧
FOR ME 12-6 BANGER🔥🔥🔥🔥
Day 1 of randomly commenting its ollie ball here on a video. Its ollie ball here
US won every single one
Simon is such a simp for Americans
THANKS FOR REACTING TO MY TIKTOK- U.K. reigns supreme ♥️
BRO YOU DIDN'T BRING UP THE ROADMEN GUY FROM TIKTOK.
"Ill give it to the UK" was used multiple times. He knew the US was better but didn't want to give it to the US
6:46 that’s the point tho 😐
USA definitely better but the uk just too relatable not to love
We want the streamer life sim daily
Is it me or anyone getting pissed at how many adds are in the video. 😬😡😩
he's getting revenge for the revolutionary war
should of been 18/0 to the uk tho
I’m from the UK but I gotta say, Simon scripted this competition
I still get MGK vibes from Simon
This is rigged
My scores  UK:5 US:15
🇺🇸 USA.
Who picked these out?
ill be honest overall USA is just better just cuz they got more ppl so more chances of having good tiktok vids
Gotta be honest the UK ones were terrible for the most part
I dont think I have ever seen a UK tik tok that actually made me laugh. Im from the US so its probably that I dont relate to them or have the same experiences, as well as their language being noticeably different.  I also dont have tik tok downloaded so I only see the ones people share or react to.  Anyone got any recomendarions to watch.
Biased
How tf in the compilation,there wasnt that guy from the UK who makes the roadmen memes. That always cracks me up.
Simon trying so hard to help the UK lol
Uk all the way
Not even got funny ones from the UK
irish tiktock > US tiktock
This video idea was class ngl
Hella biased
13:19 when did jj walk in the room
12:25 is that slowthai 😂😂
He had to give it to the UK. I got to be honest. I would have called most of them the other way. He gave some to the US were I was dying to the UK one, but then would give the point to some trash UK clip of a duck.
The UK get de Dub ayy
Ollie ball isn’t funny
Ngl defo bias.
A like if u agree this should be a series
Why was there no school ones? They r the funniest.
USA: We have the best TikTokers! Ollie Ball: It's Ollie Ball here
Simon at the end be like: this is big because i dont care...
He laughed at ever USA one then said but gotta give it too uk 💀😂😂
but.... timmy turner is leng idm being him
Why is UK just england
Uk ones were terrible the draws blew my mind
Ay my us brothers no disrespect but UK won but I liked alot from us but lads uk was mad
13:46 Even tho he doesn’t find this funny I laved this
Ukkkkk
FROOOOOOOM THE UNITED KINGDOM
nolimitsmedia is goated on tiktok
Why did he call it U.K. when it was just English
Uk100%
If I'm being honest only 1 of the UK vids made me laugh but 90% of the US ones were bangers. (Also, I think that the trashcan vid was WAAAAAAY better than Randy's weatherman one)
The real winner: Aussie TikTok
last time I seen Simon do a UK vs US, he was still mates with fangbanger
My guy biased as fuck.
Bias let’s be honest😂😂
UK for YouTube and US for TikTok
1:06 that’s what she said 😂
UK won fair and square congrats
im from UK, but USA is 10milion times better
The one where the girls were winking in a weird way and then the dude's eye just travels FUCKING SENT ME LMFAO
UK win ez
UK: "...It's Ollie Baaaaawwwwlll Heeeree"  USA: **Man Tugging his schlong**
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS KEEP GOING
Came here from the fourbrother instagram promotion, great video
he's got those W2S hands in the intro
Americans aren’t funny
Yeah if you actually spend time on tik tok you know damn well the US has better tik toks
UK better we got big ol Ollie repping us 💜
14:35 naaaaaa US won that easily. I’m uk team but it’s cause Simon can’t relate, that ones hilarious
uk will always be on top
The us ones were funny and the UK ones were mostly *I can relate*
Olie Ball is overrated
It just had to be Ollie ball in the intro he is definitely that popular he might get knighted by her majesty herself?
British humour is better than US humour
The American ones were so bad that I went to scroll, then realised I was watching a YouTube video
UK prejudice
3:05 AM over here in India and I'm watching your video and other Sidemen videos. I really think I'm obsessed with the Sidemen! Love you guys. Keep going ❤️
Should’ve been main Channel
Real score 8 UK - 10 US Legitimately
Damn the adds r mad get the dough I guess
don't care how much hate i get from the Americans but they are a set 8 England.
lol randy's was trashhhh tho
If talia was on this video this could’ve been a main channel video
Damn it was somewhat buyest but he made good points
USA won this tho?
Why are Americans getting offended and crying that Simon thought the uk TikToks were funnier
Man, people are so competitive about this. Everyone got their opinions, admittingly both have absolute bangers and this is just a fun little comparison that should mean nothing to you unless you want to get offended!
It’s Ollie ball here 🙌🐐🔥
_Biased_
he did everything in his power to give the UK points😂
Didn’t laugh to a single one. Why?
Post daily streaming simulator
UK 4 DA WIN
whoever sent the tik toks for US sent trash ones where my mans with the red shirt
The UK is superior
14:05 is this some poor joke that I'm too rich to understand?!
Not from the uk or the us but usa takes this one. Some of them in general weren’t funny but I like few from both countries.
Am i the only one that thinks us should have won both draws
Simon: she’s seems like a nice person, she seems cute.  Someone’s gonna make him commit die on Reddit 😭
11:04 i legit did that just because of this video its so funny seeing the persons reaction
I think this was the closest UK v US comparison I’ve ever seen
There are way better US tiktoks than the ones in the video
True close one, i had the score 16-3 to the US.  But Randolph one was my favorite
Me a middle child watching that tiktok: 🥲
THE UK IS SUPERIOR
I’m from Austria but I think the US ones were funnier
Both aren’t funny
NDL
You should watch Canadian ones
Is it just me or was Randy's not that good
He should do a subnautica playthrough
Simon pls make streaming simulator a daily series!!!!
3.4K left 😂
‘A majority Draw’
YES MICAH!
U not even fair
Watchu trying to get into? 👊
Hedgehog Apparently taste like chicken and his cooked in a ball of clay
ngl, there was biase on one or two.
How can u be so biased
Ou 8:07
UK for life my drilla's
Lmao the dax kangaroo
ollie ball just isnt funny at all and ill die on this hill.
UK ALL THE WAY AND IM FROM US
I dislike miniminter, the US have no comedy and humour, the UK has the greatest I'm sorry but it had to be said
This man is so biased, he gave it to some DEADD tiktoks bro..
Simon Favours his country
14:45 “Only joost”
Simon knew he would be slaughtered in the comments if he didn't give it to the UK lmao
“It’s Ollie Ball here” can never be topped
I hate American tik tokers even tho I'm American
This isn’t streamer simulator?
ollie ball is the greatest human on tik tok even in the US i promise
There was some clear bias here
React to Canadian TikTok
6:50 he clearly doesn't have any homies
The angler fish lives at the bottom of the ocean so Man is safe
US tik tok bein funnier simon:its a draw
It's always UK vs US no one ever cares about us aussie blokes
Us is a stinker
I like Britain tiktoks but I have to rep my country...USA
U cheating
Where was Ollie ball
How tik tak is from uk an how is from USA?????
Claim your here before copyright ticket
I can’t lie I think US r the TikTokers even though it’s close and I’m from the UK
Can somebody pls confirm that the girl from 12:30 is actually Alex Blake
Ollie ball and his pal will be the new ant n dec
The thing is with this, a lot of funny tik toks are BASED off of relatability, and Ppl from Uk and us relate to different things. Like if an American reacted to the same ones it would be flipped completely
ItS OlLIe BaLL hEre
Where is the streamer life simulator content??
Icl out of these tiktoks US actually won Simon was just being a bit biased
Tbh all those tik toks were mid
Four brothers have much better ones than that. They would have won for sure
The list is F ed
Lots of people saying USofA won and he is biased but come I'm pretty sure they are biased to and would have only picked the US ones. Atleast Simon picked some of yours
Only thing you had on me was l got sloppy seconds
Simon is the goat,
UK I didn't find funny
3:58 sounds  like a 14 yr going through puberty
You know what, minter lad you’re doing great.
Next time if u do this again you should do to completely different countries to make it non bias for him
It’s Ollie ball here
These were the worst tiktoks ever
2:09 swear that's filly
I'm from another country , and I had it 6 UK 🇬🇧 and 14 USA 🇺🇸. It's funnier and has more variety .
If you as a Brit let the Americans win, I would’ve been in shock
R.I.P Middle child’s 😔
Ding dang doo
Sorry Simon i didnt comp the vid i was eating and i saw what happened on 19:10   nope nope nope
bro he picked the worst us tik toks
Us better
13:13 after jj finishes
uk
J
only ever laughed at uk tik toks.
I scored it 11-9 to the US
if you're British you should definitely watch the fourbrothers tik tok because you can relate to them a lot
u should react to trarags
So far every uk tiktok you’ve done sucks
USSSSS
Ollie ball is elite.
Idk sorry gonna say it uk tiktoks are just stinky asf man lol gonna say it haha the funny just ain’t there but the real snob cringe is
beans
Simon back at it again with the tik tock vids🔥👌🏾
I thought tiktok was banned in the usa
This man is so underrated ngl
Tik tok sucks in all countries
Usa: renegade  Britain: Ollie ball  I think we know who’s won
is it just me or is that the pepega emote from twitch 6:03
You need to watch USA country tik toks
I sense some bias
We all know you chose UK to win because your British, which is fine..... because so am I 😂😂
Ayyy i made it in the vid twice ❤️ much love for reacting man means a lot foreal!!!
Simon trying way to hard to give uk the win
Those draws should’ve went to the USA
Do streamer simulator every day
I love how they had to show bad US tiktokers because they couldn’t show people like Charlie D’Amelio or else the US would have stormed the competition.
How r u not gonna add ollie ball
Some of the US was better, just saying
no talia no likey
Simon: randomly chosen  Me: no shot
Let's be honest he wasn't gonna let the us win  even one made him forget the uk one but he give them a draw (he did that twice)  hhh Simon is funny us won tho 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
To be fair Simon was hella bias on some of them
simon: this is definitely england or uk everyone: well then
Me waiting for him to react to vines next🙌
fam comeon its us
Ollie Ball is better than any American tiktoker
icl UK tik toks are just a whole level above, those were the stinkiest of them all
Curveball, everyone loses.
Most of them tiktoks were cringe especially that British blackman talking about animals jumping around.
Simon it’s 2021 you don’t need to do stupid faces in the thumbnail to get views it’s also false advertisement which is illegal
11:00 is classssss😂
Someone needs to give Simon some help  Eating hedgehogs is not ok
As an Asian, and as much as I think Americans are very weird, they won this for me by a margin.
Upload the stream game pls
10:12 YO ITS 666
The UK tiktoks I just can’t understand them ever I landed in uk tiktok the other night didn’t find one video funny at all
We med a part 2
Im unreasonably mad that the us lost. Like i wanna cuss you out for being biased. Idk why
Lmao everyone is so salty in the comments, it's his opinion it's really not that deep.
The delusion is mad
TheF0urbrothers on TikTok are elite comedy lmao 😂. Watch them all the time
yes
That last British one is actually an Irish lad.🤷🏻
I have a gastric reflux but THAT has never happened🤣
Had to follow that nolimitsmedia lad he was craking me up
There should’ve been a talia one. Some of hers are actually really funny 🙂
almost all Uk one's were far better imo
Bruh this was so biased lmao what was the point 😂
not gonna lie that randy one wasn't better then the US one. That was biased from Simon
I didn't think this vid would be as great as it is
Americans aren't funny
They were all dead ☠️
Ngl Simon I didn’t care who won coz I’m Irish and we don’t like England or the U.S.A and I know it doesn’t matter at all but u were biased
😂😂 most bias scoring haha *realises uk will be even* “you know what I’ll give that a draw” 😂😂
UK best
You know it’s a good video when Simon has his notepad out
Only Miniminter can make me watch tiktoks and not regret it
Really wanna see another one of these vids laughers 😂
“i think there’s 20”  score: 10-8 mafs
Should've been a main channel vid
Putting one of your best friends in there might be a bit of cheating you know. Also, I don't think ANYTHING can beat the girl calling her boyfriends sister one, that's the best thing ever.
I love how he is actually writing down the points 😂
Really good video
Simon, as someone from the US, that vid with the burping girl was the least funny thing on earth, sadly we have a lot of girls like that representing our tik tok
8:38 JJ would be jealous
Bias
Nahhhhhh u tried ur best to make the UK win, some of them we shouldn’t of got🤣🤣
Uk
13:10  Spain without s
we gonna ignore the fact he called a goose a duck
You will never be a judge, every one can see you taking side's
Biased
So it was a split decision
13:00 sweet home alabama
Weres the link
U.s. won low key
Simon is surprisingly fair. I agreed with him everytime.
I love the UK but USA won this.
I can't be the only one thinking some of these match ups are so one sided
uk are the memers us are the dancers
It’s Ollie ballllll here
you were Kinda Beist 😂
Let's be honest he wasn't gonna let the us win  even one made him forget the uk one but he give them a draw (he did that twice)  hhh Simon is funny us won tho 😂😂😂
ngl it seemed a little biased 😂
Simons said they overdid the handshake when they were saying goodbye but damn the amount of times I do that same thing with my friends haha
UK ALL THE WAY AND IM FROM US
Bias
This seems very one sided but still hella funny
Make sure to vote NIKO for mayor!!!!!!
BANGING VIDEO
HEMSO
HHHHEEEMMMSSSOOO
Ollie Ball has way more talent than Bryce at least Ollie got famous from food Bryce got famous from Addison
Wow Simon count wins as Biden count votes. I mean Kamala
i’m getting some biased vibes
THE BIGGEST WIN SINCE KSI VS LOGAN PAUL!
USA ones just aren’t funny
tbh they were all pretty weak
Wow simon rly a draw?! the us was 100x times better
13:17 New title stevens sister talking to stevens ex
Don’t eat the hedgehog tho Simon
Ollie ball won
The thumbnails are really declining
Omg you have to react gay tiktok or bi tiktok compared to straight tiktok
Oh my how can you not have seen it yet Simon Its not Randolph uk its Randol phuk !!!
These are poor tik toks but I can confirm U.K. wins!
Simon 7/3/2021: Now i wanna eat an hedgehog.
Do Ireland vs UK tik toks
Let’s be honest he was never gonna let the USA win.
Ngl If you are from elsewhere than UK and US, most UK ones were unrelatable so you gotta give it to the US.
It's because he is form uk
React to indian reels bro
4:19 and thats why just 1 of the reasons im against trans.
you got 4 wrong
Can u plz reply
OBVIOUSLY UK IS THE BEST
UK VS AUS TIKTOKS
Hedgehog is actually rather tasty! It's a bit like rabbit, and quite fatty, but very tasty if cooked properly!
I mean we have better music, girls, and slang soooo U.S is better overall
6:32 is that JJ?
the fact all the UK McDonald's look the same the way I shouted omg is that my McDonald's 😭😂
Biased
Im from the USA and I’m kinda salty about UK winning
Funny how there's no dancing ones
Simon's videos are entertaining
We have ollie ball. That is all we need to win
*bias*
I did it with you and I got a draw. 10-10 UK v USA
I don't think the hedgehog guy meant for you to eat it
disrespecting db franchise by calling having ultra instinct being a ninga :(
We want the streamer life simulator uploadssss lmao
At 4:15 I'm getting flashbacks to old vids of you know you know
If I was Fromm India I will. Say Indian tiktoks are the. Best but there are not indian tiktoks
I do think America is better with dark humor, then again I only see TikToks on YouTube and when people send me them
Do UK vs Canada
The last “UK” was Irish actually
Its Ollie Ball here 😂😂
what happened to the Old Spice Commercials reaction video?
last ;)
Another Tiktok reaction ya Narseyyyeeee
Americans are bent
NOOOO I WANT LIVE STREAM SIM
This was very biased
uk
The fact Simon hasn't seen some of these as many of these weren't the original... MEANS I WATCH TOOOO MANNNNYYYYY TIK TOKKKIIEEESSS
based
More of this please
Simon just desperately trine find reasons to keep the scores competitive
React to UK VS US twitch streamers
Bull sheeeet

UK Tiktok is way better than US tiktok, hands down
im from the U.S.  but man this tik tok boys act so feminine
He should’ve done this with Talia💔
Simon finna leave youtube for tiktok any day now 😔
8:54
team uk
Niko for mayor.all I have to say...
What does a hedgehog taste like 😔
Us has more dances which is dead 😂
Not the cringe tiktok ffs 🤦🏻‍♂️
No need to brag but the brothers st 2:33 live on my road
I have to sacrifice watching one of Simone streams just so I can watch this video
It would have been more realistic if the uk started with a 13-0 lead but still a good video
He picked some bad uk ones
Uk tik tok is so much better than USA tik tok
uk has won just because ollie ball is on the thumbnail😂😂🏌🏿
Simon is underrated.
Simon - She seems cute. Us: What did he say?
Simon saying “it’s Ollie ball” is still stuck in my head
I bet simon wont pin this comment
Isn’t this basically Miniminter content quality?
literally to the 1% who’s reading this, God bless you, and may your dreams come true stay safe and have a wonderful day :):)
UK wins because we have Ollie Ball
