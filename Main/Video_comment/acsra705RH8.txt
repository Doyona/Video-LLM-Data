📌Okay... lets keep it THOROUGHBRED. Jackboy hiding under a bed talking his junk. He frfr can't come outside in FLBroward Steets. Iykyk jackboy is a Stunt Man. Nga pulls stunts. PERIOD ... its a persona : a role or character adopted by an author (Yak) or an actor (jackboy)- Yoooo jackboy doesn't even know who he is anymore. Because he lives in fear. Haitians know KODAKBLACK go ✊🏽 "dezod" for Haiti🇭🇹 The motto "L'Union Fait La Force," which means "unity is strength,"  Yak stands On it! For example, Hey jackboy " How DID YOU start eating Country Boy!?" 👀 Iykyk 🦅 One thing for sure what #jackboy isn't going to do is PIN HAITIANS AGAINST HAITIANS 🇭🇹 ...So StuntMan you born in Haiti huh? So 😳 what! #KODAKBLACK still more Zoe than you! StunMan who PRONOUNCED you to the World? #YakCreatedJackboy . StuntMan you better Stop flying around tryna 😤 recruit fellow haitians that don't know any better 🦍🦍🦍 StuntMan where is the Hospital you promised Haiti? Yak help put Haiti on the map.  And you pull a propaganda  stunt. Like go hide in Haiti shoot a music video (Gaslight) 📹 Than come back to the States start a GoFund me for a "hospital " BUT YOU TAKE THE MONEY AND START A RESTAURANT! #yakrealer The SAME MAN jackboy loves to hates soo much, is the SAME MAN keeping him ALIVE  around the Global!! Im sure if it frfrfr REALLY 👹⚔ came  down to "lage" ... 😆 😂  that trip #jackboy took to the WuLady, wouldn't matter much if #kodakblack were to say its time to "Cut the head off that snake🐍" Z.O.E's would than "koupe tèt Jackboy Pierre Delince!!!" #YAKATTACK   PSA: I'm not going back and forth with no commenter! Just Thank Me Later🥂👹⚔🦅🤞🏽 🇭🇹

† We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing in our hearts that Jesus died for us, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we have done or will do.  This is the gospel: 1 Corinthians 15 3 Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures Trust in this gospel to save you from your sins

Keep spinning buddy what goes around comes around and I’m so surprised at the level of Kodak black he is supporting this negativity at his level he knows he is a big influence to these street kids and instead of showing positivity he is still on that negativity I guess he still has some growing to do and I don’t know if people are blind but that’s what’s causing the black on black crimes rate go up anyhow this is just my opinion 💯
niggaz kno not to play wit Z
yak trippin talkin bout smoking k2 n snorting ercs 😂😂😂😂
