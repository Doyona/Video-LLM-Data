Ganymedes voice sounds a bit different
Hahahahhahaha  ganymede😅😂😂
1:43 Timmy is CRAZY
1:15 Mimas is JUST like saturn. Like moon like planet 😭😭🙏
Ganymede sounds like a surfer dude compared to now, he sounds like a less angry Venus
1:18 lol
Ganymede sounded so different in this one
Wow i already ship Dione and ganymede bc he called dione babe

Ganymede sounded different compared to the new episode 😮..
This is My favorite episode of SolarBalls yet
8:00 it’s actually pronounced gan-maid
2:13 IS THIS PLANET X THE strange PLANET
0:06 Tf is "space candy"? 0:55 HE AIN'T WRONG-
0:41 Ganymede’s voice changed a lot. His voice sounds like a titan, and now his voice sounds like Venus.
Ganymede's voice, then to now, is wild. Not even Ganymede, literally every moon sounds different now to then. But who's voiced changed the most?
1:44 timmy is outrageous 😭
Nahh you're telling me io has space covid 💀
No one gonna talk about this part? 1:17
I like how jupiters the smartest and we used to say  Boy go to Jupiter to get more stupider
Exo-Planet: Hey moon, come into my van. You can get some candy. Titan: Shut Up.
Anyone in 2024 👇
0:33   “Looks like you have competition   “Tell me one thing uhh..”😒  “Enceladus, and don’t you dare call me-“😠  “Tell me Ensalada, do you know where this “Titan” went?”😀  “I don’t respond to the name ensalada!” 😤
Why is no one talking about the fact that Io coughed on the Moon?
I like them,but I think you should make more and on earth ones WHY DO THEY CALL US EARTHLINGS INSTEAD OF HUMANS?!?!
6:13 Luna: Who are you and where are you going? Callisto: We're looking fo- Io: *FNAF JUMPSCARE*  XDDDD
1:17 - 1:23 The way that Ganymede called Dione Babe is so funny and how he tried to fix it😂😂😂😂😂
“YEEEEP!” “ugh- *says io in the most emo angry voice ever known to all emo towns, communities, and books of the universe* 7:15
dafck is "space candy"?
1:16 we'll do babe💀💀
Ganymade's "Will Do, Babe" got me rolling on floor and laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
4:10 MERMISTA IS THAT YOU??
As a gmf, i need help Anyways random essay Ganymede was a trojan prince. He was very beautiful, and Zeus found him. He decided to kidnap him to Olympus. His parents were very sad. So they were given horses. Ganymede served as Zeus cupbearer and lover.
AIN'T NO WAY JUPITER THINKS TITAN WOULD GET KIDNAPPED.. 💀
😂
I love Callisto I’m really like her I only actually have nightmares😂
5:46
Can u make a video with a zombie planet or a blanet
0:00- 0:09  average free candy guy
Moon9
At multiple seconds of the 4:00 minute mark in The Moons of Jupiter - Part 1, when Io spins his shadow spins with him, but shadows are not meant to do that.
02:22 Jupiter is studying mythology, I love this
I love how the kept arguing in the back 🤣 😂
Io is my favorite of Jupiter's 🌙 because it's the most geologically active 🌙 in the Solar System. It's full of lava lakes and 🌋 constantly erupting so I love that its being portrayed as a sickly moon with the coughing in this series. Especially at 1:54 and 5:02. And 6:17 with sneezing on 🌎's 🌙. 😅
The first one to call the eyes one in salata his voice sounds different from when we hear later on
I am so happy!
6:25 or 6:24 6:56  Moon? 🤨
Io is coughing cos is a volcanic moon
earth: neglectful mean dad who has been through a lot mars: currently unknown how he treats his moons  jupiter: calm, responsible and caring dad saturn: dad that tries to treat all his kids equally but has a favourite uranus and neptune: we also don't know how they treat theyre moons
i love how jupiter seems to be reading a book on mythology when his moons ask if they can look for titan since all the planets are named after the roman versions of greek gods and characters
People who noticed the twitch in the planet who ganemede said babe too eye👇
It’s the reason i love Callisto!
Ganymede: the cool kid   Europa: in love with Ganymede
5:13 europa: tha        pa lease
Why did you do this to our moon 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 of earth
Io has asthma    (Coming from an asthmatic)
fun fact: phobos and deimos probably used to be asteroids in the asteroid belt before being captured by mars and becoming it's moons. but they think the aster. belt is creepy, so does that mean that they're whole life before being mars moons was a "hard, scary life"?
IO is now my favorite character
Phobos & Deimos zooming past Ganymede & Europa is funny to me though 🤣
0:44 Enceladus: I DON'T RESPOND TO THE NAME ENSALADA!😡
Stranger danger 😂 am I right
“  “Ur Gravity barely has an affect on me”ugh who does he thing he is💅😒”
Ganymede's Voice Likes Triton!
5:17 is weird😁
Fact: Europa (moon) produces 1000 tons of oxygen every day
Callisto giving the emo vibess☠️
Correct Ganymede the largest moon you are correct
How to practice Spanish: Saturn
Have a another star in next videos？               Example Sirius。
all the time you see callisto she is acting Emotionless but i only saw her mad once and i dont think callisto can experience sadness or happienes   and if that is true what i said must not be so good for callisto
5:33 and did you EXPECT THE PLANETS TO REMEMBER ALL THE NAMES?
1:17 Wait who's that moon who Ganymede called Babe-? Also, I love how Calisto is the most normal person in the group-
7:07 Cute Voice IO!
will do babe. What! uh-uh i mean will do bye-bye💀
What about Neptune's moons?
Did i just now figured out that Ganymede and Europa are actually dating😭
Why is Ganymedes voice so different-
0:47 I love Iapetus' voice, he sounds like really emo (//_^)
1:30 - 5:00 (excluding the sponsor) Does somebody know the name of the soundtrack played in the background?
Do not let Europa see Europa
1:09. A subtle reference I only recently noticed between Saturn & 1 of his Moons. Saturn about Eris in Who's That Planet!? after she refused to help him & Uranus find Neptune: "I like her." Mimas about Jupiter's A-Team of Moons here: "I like them."
Our Moon is the third biggest moon in the solar system actually.
his name is titan and my name is timmy!
Space candy 💀
1:17 🤨
Kalisto is def lily but as a planet
HELP I THOUGHT  THIS WAS A NEW EPISODE-
Timmy?...WOW TITAN GETS A NICKNAME
Kinda funny that Ganymede of all moons has a girlfriend
Ganymede❌ Gaymermaid👍
why is jupiter southern now
HELP IM DYING ON 6:24
Jupiter is such a dad
I love how chill Jupiter, he's like that one favorite parent
5:17 Europa : I don't know *"babe"*  She really acting like a teenage jealous girlfriend. 😭 I mean Jupiter's A-Team are like a bunch of highschoolers. The jock and leader of (mis)adventures [Ganymede], the sassy baddie one which happens to be the jock's love interest [Europa], the emo nihilistic kid who may have watched Wednesday 30++ times [Callisto] and the weird energetic one who happens to be sickly [IO]
Literalmente a Ganímedes le cambió bastante la voz desde su primera aparición hasta el fin de la revolución lunar o_O. En español la voz de la luna mas grande es la misma :v
Moon : "well, I...." Callisto: "don't care" In the moon's mind : "wtf"
Moon planet star
But ok
Ok ok but have you get vidos in youtebe?
Ganymede is awesome 😎
I SAY WE GO LOOK FOR TIMMY got me😂 1:43
Jupiter is an awesome dad
Offers titan space candy*
7:37  YeAh THe AstReoiD BeLT Is CRYppy!💀💀💀
2:27 nooo i wanted to know :(
0:07 I can’t believe Saturn said space candy I guess exoplanets kidnap moons now
1:44 Ganymade being friendly for once and bro Timmy?!?!?!?💀☠
I saw Phobos and Deimos run fast as they can then Europa and Ganymede saw them yeah is Phobos and Deimos so small mars moons
Ganymede almost cheated on Europa with Dione
If you look closely io has a atmosphere
Am i the only one who rolled one the floor when i saw ganymede smile on the thubnail ☠️
5:09 That yay sounds cheerful😃
Random fun fact I made a model of the most inhabitable moons (according to Google) and I made three of jupiters moons!! (Callisto, Ganymede and Europa)
I just wanna say I really like this channel and i am wondering when the moon revaloution part 4 will come out :)
You gotta get that check Eio✨
6:24 The Moon didn't even do anything to him though
Всем привет Я с шаранутого космоса русской версии:)
io: R-RUN CALLISTO!!!!!!! love that part
Ngl Jupiters actually kinda chill with his moons
Bro really roasted Mr spherical (i think he sometimes does this kind of stuff) at 2:59
The voice of callisto 4:17, 4:20 and 4:22
“Will do babe” got me laughing 😂 lol
Callisto is emo!!1!
Is it just me or since this episode ganymedes voice has changed slightly
2:43
it’s time to ship moons.
Did anyone expect the moons of Jupiter to end up causing a lot of chaos in the future?
When they wear staring at each other europa was so funny in the background😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When Europa said: 4:04  "YoUr GrAvItY BaReLy HaS aN EfFeCt oN mE" made me laughing for 2.5 minutes
… 6:14
ايييييييي😊
If jupiter is cool so his moons too
Hey did enyone hir the uhhh~ of🤨🤨🤨of the earths moon when he got hit🤔🤔
Ganymede is a huge moon its bigger than Mercury
Not me enjoying this series better than any
If Ganymede or Europa pairs up with Io, Io would disturb him (same as Callisto)
If you strip Jupiter of all its gases it will still be larger than Saturn despite of them being called gas Giants they have a significant amount of liquids at some depth in their atmosphere all the way down to the core
Io and Callisto are like beast boy and raven from teen titans go and Ganymede and Europa are like robin and starfire
2:41 damn you got me lol
I’m the only one that thought at the end the titan was going to say we are THE SAME SIZE

Those moons of Jupiter called Galilean Moons   1610, Famous Astronomer Galileo Galilei saw those four largest moons orbiting around Jupiter through his telescope in real life in the past.  I was first sighting of Jupiter and four moons through telescope. Is pretty realistic.  I like this animation good job

Do the moons of Uranus
Angry
:3… 6:22
1:59 Bruh it's already checked out why Io is like that. It's because of Jupiter's strong gravity that he gets all that volcanic activity. Probably because of that he coughs out that stuff.
1:17 Dione’s eye twitches get me all the time
Bro turned into mr beast 💀💀💀
I just love solarballs
6:17 Looks like IO has Allergies
sponsor skip 4:02
6:25 WHY DOES HIS SCREAM SOUND LIKE THAT?😭
Wait, no
2:24 story time!
Ganymade don't call a moon babe because moon girl will push u out of ur orbit and u will die
Honestly Jupiter should have said, “Actually the sun makes up 99 percent of the solar system.”
0:00 Saturn is generally sad
6:26 Moon-?🤨
4:00 the end of the sponsor
Ganymede is like a typical high school jock

Can’t wait for Humans to send people to colonize Europa in tiny subs miles under the surface!   This is a reference to a videogame named Barotrauma
Your family will go on a family lunch dinner dinner 🥘 we can go for a quick dinner tonight and we have to do something quick lunch tonight at the house and we have a lunch lunch 🥗 we will be done ✔️ lunch dinner at dinner
Bro the time when i see Ganymede and Europa got shocked when they see Phobos and Deimos running away 😂😂😂
Does no one talk about the moan that the moon made at the second 6:25?
Europa is like she has a boyfriend 💀
Io is the best
finally some non-brain-dead kids channels. this channel actually  teaches u useful stuff.
In the start of the video the interaction between saturn and jupiter looks like a calm person being understanding qnd trying to not invalid their partener's feelings, its really sweet, make me ship them
I wanna join patron, but I don't wanna accidentally use my dad's money 💀
Pause at 3:01 and earth looks crazy
I wish I was in that club but I'm to young😭😭😭😭
Europa is a girl.
Why tf does Europe's voice sound so similar to GlaDOS from P0rtal? (or at least for me lol)
7:53 Bro really said im gay 💀
I have been watching this channel since the first episode
0:07 I get high on space candy
Two of them attack from behind!!!!!

Space candy got me rolling😂
Dfg
Ganymede is little smaller than mars
1:18 Dione looked more offended than europa despite europa being the one dating ganymede. Hmmmmmmm....🤔🤔🤔
Fun fact a unique thing about Ganymede is that its the only moon with a magnetic feild
Can a moon have a moon?
Moon and planet and star
The moon
Io: The Jolly One Europa: The Average One Ganymede: The Jock Guy Callisto: The Moody Emo One
Fun Fact: The reason Io is portrayed as the sick one is because Io is the most volcanically active of all the moons. It has lava lakes and lots of active volcanos on its surface.
Hehe
IO SOUNDS LIKE TWEEK HELP😭💀
Earth: I sent ALL MY HUMANS into space and the last human that comes back wins A BAZILLION DOLLARS!!!
Hey Ant! You're such a teeny-weeny!!!

Io cough 😷🤣 01:31 01:56 05:01 05:56 06:07 06:18 blaaa chuuu! 07:09
Ok, but have any of y’all realize the sun is always watching everyone😂
Triton??? Isn't that neptune's moon??
Earth has turned into Mr beast💀
I say we go look for Kenny me realized
I think why Jupiter said "The Solar System is not that big" i think hes talking about how he is the biggest planet in the Solar System.
Jupiter is probably the nicest planet after this video
Wait Io has ATMOSPHERE😧
6:26
2:59 MrBearth💀
And after the end of  every episode I always say... "What the heck I'll just watch another"
Ok I'm a ssf . (secret solarballs fan !) And I have a suggestion that Venus and mars purposely left earth saying that the Galilean moons DID say that they had to to take the earth down. But I guess we all just have to wait...
Can you make a video that saturn meets j1407b super saturn

Neptune's moon
I saw the asteroid running fast at 5:46 , 5:51
The part that made me laugh: 1:56 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When Jupiter was reading, he flipped to the wrong page
I love how Jupiter is like a Chill and Smart Dad Now.
0:16 Jupiter: "The Solar System's not that big-" Saturn: *"YES IT IS!!!!"*
I like IO for some reason, idk why
Titan and Ganymede got beef💀
hi im new nd i kinda like this your nice hope you have 1m subs one day
Ganymede and Titan have in real trouble About the largest moon now
Moons of Uranus anyone???
I love how phobos said “Oh”. His voice is so cute and squeaky
Jeez Saturn

1:16 lol enceladus is same size as saturn lol
euoropa acts like a ✨✨material girl✨✨
3:00 wha- what happened turn Earthlings? WAAAAAAAAAAA
I heard MOVI4!???!!!!!
so we know that: the sun is a psycho  mercury is a planet venus is a rude guy earth is a dominator that thinks hes the only terraformed planet mars is the opposite of rude  titan is peaceful ganymede is chill and cool europa is kind (unless if shes pissed off) callisto is an emo Io is a diseased freak (i like him) earth's moon is questionable phobos and deimos are twins ceres is a villan wanabe  jupiter is a father wanabe  saturn is the god of moons uranus stinks neptune is a schizo with therapy problems pluto is sensitive and charon is everysingle girl buying theyre favorite product(i dont think im spittin fax)
ganymede picked europa for himself because he had a crush on her but ended up finding out that he has 0 rizz 💀💀
“My core belongs to you” 😐
L rizz io
Bro Jupiter has 79 moons not 82 Saturn has 82 moons tho
U should make Ganymede more grey
Hello jupiter
Play juju on I want patriot on
Ok
BUT MOON IO
2:17 - "You don't want to get caught up in their orbit and end up like Triton." Listen to him, Ganymede! He's right. You don't.
ill finish and tell you all how i captured triton once upon a time their was a moon named triton uranus my brother was further then me in orbit then i decided i would migrate and then i captured triton then i am in the orbit today
1:18 XD
what jupiter said about triton being caught in a planets orbit, i have a feeling that triton never formed in neptunes orbit but instead was caught by neptune. did you guys know that? or did you already know that?
Ganymede: The Big Boy with balls of steel Europa: The Gen Z’er Callisto: The Edgy Teen who never smiles  IO: The Kid with Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder and drank 28 mugs of coffee 36 cans of Dr Pepper and ate 71 car engines worth of sugar.
6:25 uhm... kinda sus...
Now un spanish please
I think I saw you say or you supposed to say it spread out
Like what
Comet moon star
I’ve been watching since the first episode
For anyone who doesn't know why Io coughs orange stuff: Io is the most volcanic moon in our solar system. Sometimes when there is an eruption Io spews out a solid called "Sulphur" (And yes it is a orange solid)
Why you are not the greatest blessing to you
Ganymede is huge.
I'm pretty sure Enceladus also has a sub-surface ocean.
cool
“SPÆCE CÆNDY”
“SPÆCE CÆNDY”
1:03 Mimas sounded like the moon
There are also secret dwarf planets
I like every planet
4:02
I think that Phobos and Deimos are like Ant and Dec on Britain's Got Talent.
Io is a Volcano  Europa are water and Ice Ganymede is rock Well I don't know without Callisto?🤔
Love how the sun is just in the background
5:54 "Let’s go check it out💅💅💅💅💅💅💅"
HAHAHA iliked it when ganymede called saturn s moon babe but is ganymede in love with europa
That ending was super cool
Io is literally an asthmatic kid with adhd ☠️
I think the moons are my favorite characters
"Anyone want any space candy?"
io reminds me of tweek
9. Deys ago
He Just Said instead of titan Ganymede said timmy💀
Callisto and Europe give Kim and Kourtney Kardasim   Also, Jupiter has the most annoying moons
Jupiter is so dad
Callisto aka Raven from the teen titans go
Actually Jupiter only has 79 moons
WHY DO THE MOONS NOT UNDERSTAND THAT SATURN AND JUPITER ARE INNOCENT oh and mars and mercury
0:30
Moon planet star
2:22 Oh man Triton, a poor guy to live with Neptune
2:59 Mr. Beast as a planet:
Ganymede: Typical high-school jock  Callisto: Just done with everything  Europa: Loves Ganymede  Io: Fun and entertaining but has Space-Covid
One two tree four i declare a MOON war
If Jupiter ever became a talking planet, he would be a good grandfather
1:09 Ganymede be doing the bombastic  side eye
0:20  You should know that. Oh right, too fat to understand, jupiter
please dont put feminist things in Sollarballs video.... -_-
I WANT EXO PLANETS💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I love how Europa is so sarcastic
Dont ask what I’m doing
I...
ASTRO dude the movie what!
I love how Jupiters moons have a search for Titan and its just Io constantly spitting out yellow gas, though Europa is right. He should get checked by a doctor
5:57  Callisto and IO
What the f****
Gaming planets
PART TWO IN 2 HOURS
Amazing work!
6:25 picture a wall behind the moon when he crashed into those asteroids
I cant stop laughing when io coughed at the earths moon😂😂😂
Io & venus have the same voice actor
Ganymede cheated on europa 💀
When will part 2 start?
Bro why that moldy piece of cheese keep coughing
NOT THEM MAKING FUN OF MR BEAST🤣
Jupiter: "And stay away from the asteroid belt." Io: "Didn't we promise Jupiter not to enter the asteroid belt!?" Ganymede: "Technically we didn't"  Ganymede isn't following the rules.
If Europa and Ganymede saw ceres instead of the moon I would have been happy
Bro exoplanets are creeps
TITAN
Timmy💀?
you are almost clos to a M subscribers
In my opinion, io is my favorite
Your Long Videos Are The Best!
And what about the moon triton? I hope we will see his story....
yo what if in part two its (titan , moon , phobos , demos) vs (Jupiters moons) and moon avtivates its dark side...that will be awsome
Why do I have a feeling Titan is gonna lead a moon rebellion?
I can’t wait for JUPITERS MOONS PART 2 COMING TOMORROW 🎉 😃
jupiter is a stressed dad
Make the moons of Jupiter part2 I'm excited 😊 🤗
First time that Saturn is angry.
Lets You make video how did Titan and Hanimed become friends
Wait a sec, can someone please tell me if Ganymede and Europa are a couple or just weird friends. Am I looking for love were there isn't?
You should make an episode about super saturn
But why Titan see Ganymede he is angry my opinion:Is because Ganymede's emote looks very like Earth's
I want to say that Venus is the sister of the earth
3:00 this guy just rosted mrbeast
The wise planet Jupiter
Why does Titan look like peanut butter
For those who actually wanted to hear, there is a theory that Triton was actually a dwarf planet before he was caught up into Neptune’s orbit, who Jupiter meant when he said ,,weird planets”
Thats probably the most interesting advertisement ive ever seen xD
0:07 space candy
As a gmf, i need help Anyways random essay Ganymede was a trojan prince. He was very beautiful, and Zeus found him. He decided to kidnap him to Olympus. His parents were very sad. So they were given horses. Ganymede served as Zeus cupbearer and lover.
The biggest questions is how is mar and earth reacting because we know that mars likes it moons and then earth need’s it’s moon
I really dont want to see "Ganymede x Europa"
There's no way ganymede greeted titan like a school bully-
When will the planets and other moons find out that the Moon's name is Luna?
We need to see the moons of Uranus and Neptune
Wow….. the earthlings must be dead right now , the moon went out for so long and not a single planet or anything came to him so he can be back …..anyway let’s watch the episode
I think the moons are planning something, I thought of that ever since I saw the end of “Mission to Titan” video. Titan said it was time for a change- that’s a bit suspicious
😮😮❤❤😊😊Moons of Jupiter Part 3 SolarBalls at a time 😢
The most shortest battle scene 6:23
Callisto has 9999999999999 depression points
Can you edit twin earth and Mars are twin
2:29 I.O wth
I was just in patreon and i sarw that moons of f jupiter part 2 is finished so here’s my question:  IF ITS FINISHED EHY THE HECK ISINT IT ON YOUTUPE!?😭
Saturn going parenting mode believing that Titan was kidnapped with the old kidnapping way😂😂😂😂😂😂
Just 10 million dollars💀
I can already see a solar war happening
INSTANT rivalry between titan and ganymede. i can feel it. theyre gonna be at eachothers necks for the rest of the series
J
abcdefghjk
5:52 when was it funny
I think the next episode is Ganymede vs titan
I got a video idea, introduce J1407B! The planet with the biggest rings, it would be cool to see Saturn compare their rings.
We've got a competition😏
Jupiter is like a dad😮
please make a black hole
Nah the way Ganymede called Europe babe
Hey guys how many of you agree Solarballs should make Venus female
I Love My Moon Ariel and I Love Neptune’s Moon Triton
Bet he does not have life though
there's one thing titan not considering if a moon is a object that orbits a planet then technically everything in the solar system that orbits the sun is a moon of the sun
Solar balls fight sene the thing none of us wanted but got
What if saturn meet super saturn
The video will Robots conquer space I would love to see a part 2 please make 1
I want to hear about Triton
i bet europa uses spacetok
are you guys sure that Titan has life
My name in real life is titan
Lol he said babe
I got a video will premiere soon
WOW I love the new Long videos there fire!
I love how cum they had Mr Earth back
I love how come, Jupiter and Saturn treated moons differently
I thought we were done with the Titan arc!
JUPITER WAS READING MYTHOS BONEWORKS / BONELAB COLLAB WHEN
Coming from a veteran of this channel. It is amazing to see how far you’ve came.
Where's Jupiter fifth Moon
The fact that Ganymede is only 2% larger than Titan, or in short only 36~ miles larger, is such a good reason for them to be rivals over being big moons
I have a feeling earth is going to get redeemed and titan is going to be a villain just a hunch tho
Can you make a story about Tritain
Is Ganymede green or yellow
Mimas and moon have the same voice actor 1:03 1:24
1:19 did you notice diones eye was twitching? 🤯🤯🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥
Solarballs is literally my life ❤
1:44 "Timmy"
Part 2 pls
1:24 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤😂❤😂😂😂😂😂😂❤😂❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hey sollarball saturn have 145 moons now :D
woah is that a love you to bits spaceship in the end of the video cool
4:46 but the earth's moon is bigger than europa
Titan better say to Ganymede "And im the only moon with life!"
Ganymade calling saturn's moon "babe"                                                                                                                    Read more
How many programmers are you guys?
Callisto became an emo (ryhme’s)
Please make a episode where astrodude tells them about the planet that was sent hurling out of the solar system by Jupiter or Saturns gravity
Io reminds me of Gene Belcher from Bob's Burgers for some reason.
I've been watching you since the minute you came out I'm literally not joking Keep the Videos up
Govind the Asteroid belt
Bit off topic, but I would love to see the planets or moons meet an exoplanet that Saturn mentioned! Maybe… Proxima Centauri?
So basicaly at this point we have :  The sun doing random things in the backgrounds   Mercury being invisible  Venus being friend with the Earth  The Earth trying to make the others jealous while being friend with Venus and Ignoring that its moon went away  The Earth's Moon trying to figure out what to do to bring things back in place  Mars probably wondering where the heck does its moons are  The more importants moons of the Solar System doing dark things in the Astroids Belt   Ceres being a psychopath   Jupiter doing Jupiter things  Saturn desesperatly looking for Titan  Titan leading a movement with the other moons in the Astroids Belt  The others Saturn's moons being jealous of Titan  Uranus trying to understand Neptune   Neptune doing Neptune things   Pluto and its Sister dwarf planet cruising in the Kuiper Belt  And Astrodude trying to do reasearch while being always dealing with solar system objects
Heres a tiny Theory I feel like The moon Will make Callisto and Io Go to the Earth... idk just my Opinion whats going to happen???? /:
Triton arc?
So what if I can’t pay
Io needs a doctor for his health and his crazy attitude.And Callisto only has nightmares?.
Why is europa a girl what gave you that idea just asking cause I’d prefer them a boy  Edit:actually I know why cause most planets that have a chance or had or has life was a boy and Europa has a chance of life under its icy surface
Hey where’s Uranus’s moons
Video idea astrodudes partner jupiter
The next moon episode might be Neptune’s moons from the start of this episode. (I can’t stop watching this episode)
8:02 This shit's about to go down
Titan vs Ganymede (7:58 Also that mad stare of Titan was cold 🥶)
3:00 earth look like really adorable with that hat.
Titan vs Ganymede epic rivalry
I would love an episode with the sun as a red giant
Why do they have to be evil though?:(
What about supernova can you do it please?
Can you please make the planets into pokemon
Plot twist: Triton comes back and ends the solar system
Ganymede should be grayer
Bro i need a part two, this is so interesting great job 👍
Let moon tell to earth io spited
Is Io Here?
We really need to see Ceres again
5:35 woah woah woah woah they are like.. together??
6:22
Titan: im the only moon with life
the fact that i always imagend ganymede europa and io that way lmao except caliston i always saw as the nerdy book obbsesd girl haha
Didn't Io and Jupiter die already?
I like shorter videos more but longer are also OK
Solarballs is a best youtuber
I love io he has to be my third favourite moon in solarballs after dione and earths moon
Copying By Uranus Is Here
Is it me or..  Dione sounds like Astrodude's Wife Iapetus sounds like the Dark Side of the Moon Mimas sounds like the Moon (or Phobos)  ..Iiiiiii'm pretty sure it's just me
why is the moon so nosy? why is it your buisness whos going where
I want to hear about triton
Io is so funny
2nd part please
Why is her eye twitching 1:17
THIS VIDEO IS SO GOOD THAT I WATCH IT THRICE A DAY
5:00 IO has Covid-19
Wow so cool
"Lets go look for Timmy"  "TITAN"
Make a collab of countryballs and solarballs
It's thanks to Patreon that this show isn't like 3-Minute Science. And not just because 3-Minute Science posts short episodes.
Two female moons!
How did giant rock went from orbiting a planet to have relationships💀
Thank you SolarBalls and friends for this amazing content i really appreciate it.
I can't wait for part 2 your gonna love it!
😂
Idk if I'm just stupid or I'm retarded but, did you use the same voice actor of the sun in solar balls as Io?
4:02 skip the ad
PHOBOS AND DEIMOS ARE SO CUTEEE
Ganymede said finally a worthy oponent our battle will be legendary too a whole    new level💀
Explaination for triton: Scientist think that triton was pulled into orbit by Neptune some billon years ago explaining the orbit going the other direction than other neptunian moons
I SUGGESTTED THIS LETS GO
Best quotes of ganymede: 0:27 whys your planet all squeeky and annoying? 1:17 Will Do Babe- 1:44 Well go look for timmeh
2:43 Dang it, now I can't Skip
Mimas is weird but cool

Titans the biggest moon because he’s always going to be the bigger person,or well,moon
They should make a whole series of Neptune and Io
When will Jupiter moons part 2 come out? Next week Saturday in 2 weeks Saturday 3 weeks Saturday?
What did we learn today kids? Ganymede doesn't know how to handle relationships Calisto is an emo girl Europa Is Californian and Io has covid
4:38
Cen ya'll make Ganymede more gray?
We finally heard Iapetus’s voice, can you do Hyperion next? Please?

What are going to do to Titan 😨😨😨
Phobos and Deimos are fast!

*ensalada salad*
Next part 2
1:55 IO the fart cough
life vs big who will win
Probably my favorite episode so far
space candy?...new profit idea....where do i get some?
7:57 The light contrast and stare down was so crisp.
Phobos and Deimos might be a little crazy but they are so, so cute
"I dont have dreams, only nightmares.." Emo callisto 😭  Edit: We love you solarballs your a very excellent channel
2:05 Jupiter said A-team that gave me 80s vibes
“The perfect animation doesn’t exi-“
Ok I ISS
1:18 Dione’s face told the whole story as soon as Ganymede said that
I see is big HD 100546b
When Europa said ugh please I heard it ugh police
Io is sun 2.0
I have a feeling that we’re going to see Triton meet Moon,IO,and Callisto while Ganymede and Titan have a fight or not
Give us a figth
don't let ceres find them
All these worlds are yours, except Europa. Attempt no landing there.
IT IS TO FUCKING SHORT
W IO
Ganymede has that W rizz
I wonder what episode will exoplanets appear

@solarballs can you pinned this comment please

You’re flipping look just like the astroid belt
IO = sun, sun = IO
Ganymede trini hit up on uropa 5:53
this is amazing in 144p quality with my crappy internet
I want solarballs to post moons of jupiter part 2 today
7:57 Titan be like: “I thought I was the biggest moon”
Nice
Return Ceres to fight the moons
2:15 - 2:25 i tought that was Mars caught by Ceres i think?
Never let bro cook 💯💯💥💥
show episode of saturn ripping its moon into rings
7:58 why are they looking like that at each other.. As if some kind of action or fight is gonna happen🤔
What the
1:27 io's laugh is funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My name is Jeremiah and I love your videos
Titan and Ganymede probably gonna become rivals in the next part😂👍
Somehow...I'm learning?
Ganymede is desperate for europa's love. Like really desperate.
Is it me or does Europa sound like a typical teenage gen z girl
Phew
I always thought that Ganymede and Titan would have a friendly relationship, but after the end of this, They might be rivals. Ganymede is the biggest moon, but titan is the second largest moon, but he's the boss of a new gang. Ganymede might overthrow titan, which might make titan be afraid of him.
Day 1 of asking SolarBalls to do a video about exoplanets coming to the Solar System
“i don’t have dreams, i have nightmares”
I kinda want to see ganymede and earth interact
MR EAAARTHHH
You frucking ripped-off the moons of Jupiter from @Uranus Is Here  and made them with crappy personalities, you even stole the genders!
Fact: Earth is the densest planet in solar system.
Jupiter almost tells how Neptune kidnapped Triton...
Space lore
One yhing i noticed.... tritan, titan..... does that do anythibg together?
Ganymede rizzing up europa
Ganeymede is lucky he hasn't had his encounter with venus 😂😂 Pls make a vid about this it will be fire
Part 2 plis
u finally did it and i have an i dea for u solar balls i think u should add Proxima centauri b in the solar balls universe
1:05 can someone write what he said I don’t understand
Can you do dwarf planets.
Is it me or is Ganymede gonna cage fight Titan.
I feel like Ceres needs to appear a lot more in these videos where planets or moons go to the asteroid belt I wonder how that would go
“The asteroid place is creepee!!!”
4 angsty teen moons of the solar system
Uranus moons
Io is geology an active moon of Jupiter
Why is io coughing?
Basically speaking: this entire channel is about planets being racist 😂😂
Poor salad getting called ensalada
So jupiter's moons are like the cool kids group.
Finally a new video I've been waiting for so long
70% ad 30% video.
Alright! Finally getting to meet Jupiter's moons!
Uranus is here has prayed,and now god has responded.
What's going on with IO coughing?
When wil you post part 2 ❤ love you solar balls
Hey, Gayemede is right, Earth really is a jerk.
Is callisto emo 💀💀
Are the moons starting a revolution or something?
Ganymede be acting real sus 😳😳😳
I want to meet uranus and neptune moons too
Video idea: make a video about supernovas and/or neutron stars
well you act like teens with no litl siblings
I like it this dude have us talking too
I wonder how the other planets and moons fight, sun does solar flares, venus throws asteroids, earth.... maybe his earthlings will know that a planet are moons attacking the earth so they will send nukes are something idk
Fighting is in solarballs now in 6:17!
Titan vs gemimeed
Calisto's already my favorite character in this series
Can you guys make the run time 11 minutes like majority of the cartoons Cause this is quality
I have the power dont try to stop me
god I would love a chapter where the earth is jealous knowing that Mercury is now the best friend of Mars and in the end she leaves him
Will Rhea get some more screen time?
I love how the moons have more lore than the planets
Trop bien 😂
2:58 Mr Beast reference. 🤩
The fact that our moon is not on it's orbit means humanity already had perished on Earth.
7:27 Why was that the cutest “Oh, okay.” I’ve ever heard lol?
Why the hell was iO sneezing?!
Solarballs can u make jupiter angry at ganymede and the other moons of jupiter?
Io is supposed to be female too???   A priestess of Hera.
“I don’t have dreams… only nightmares. 😏” - Callisto, 2023
Is anyone not gonna talk about the part where Ganymede says "will do babe"? 😂😂
Gaynemede likes to say girls babe 😊😊😊😊😊
i have a question can kids join im a kid soooo
Saturn at the end: ya spin me right around baby right around
Iapetus voice
lo funny
Ganymede: the cool kid Europa: tik tok girl Callisto: Watched Wednesday 20 times IO: the weird sick kid  Edit: TYSM FOR THE LIKES
This video was so worth the wait!
Ganymede - The Manly one(I think)  Europa - The only Moon that has the gender of female Io - The one who gets too excited Callisto - The one that doesn't care about anything
Bro pulled middle finger💀 3:45
ive been watching you since you had 144k subs
I want part 2 also you didn't lie its long video
This is sooo Cooool
Will the dwarf planet from the asteroid belt scar the moons out of there and will the earths moon show the dark side of the moon
Video about Triton next
4:20 "I don't have dreams, Only Nightmares"
You can make 100 long videos
Watched this during premier and IO has green house cogth
this episode was EPIC...🔥 Lookin forward, to see what's happening next👀🙌🏻
00:05:42 thats what i was thinkingm tryrgehehebbuemebt ofifofof rmooonbnn. I. Having a.   Eensnw. Stronk call a bondulence
I love that "okey🙂" 7:27
6:24 jokes aside, that was a pretty cool move
This was fire🔥
We need more genders for planets 💀
4:21 ok so callistos one of *those* characters
0:30 Y is Enceladus being so cryptic
Nice vids
I think the gender of the celestial bodies should be based on what gender the mythological equivalent was. E.g. Venus and Io should be female (in my opinion), which means that all of Jupiter's moons (except for Ganymede) might end up being female... if you didn't read my last comment on this video.
When second part
Ganymede Vs Titan  THIS IS GONNA BE SMTH IMMA SEE SOON BABY SOOOOOOONNN!!
Before 3 hours 👇
Ganymede love his own self looked like that
the fact ganymede seems like a jock you see in those movies doesnt sit right with me, no offense lol
7:58 the moon stuff gets real 😎
Fun fact: ganymede is barely bigger then titan by 2%
:tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitan
Spinning Saturn 8:03
Nice
Omg I absolutely love this
1:17  sneak peek 1- “Ganymede with no context 5:06  sneak peek 2- “Mood.”
Sus parts: 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨 1:15 5:11
IDK if ganimed and titan are on the same page at the end
IO needs to go to the hospital ASAP
Those guys that were roaming around ganemade and eroper that was Phobos and dimos
Hey make a video that the sun is ACTUALLY leaving
MORE! *Slamming noises in the distance*
Bro narrator talked to himself 💀
Must say, Jupiter really is a nice planet. Gotta like the big guy.
Saturn is crying over missing titan inspite of having so many moons Meanwhile mars and earth whose only moon (and only two moons of mars) has been missing - nah let's play cards it wouldn't effect our gravity
Ganymede
In Hindi plzz
Oh that ending. Chills
7:55 my mind: i'm about to make them fight with raw strength
This is entertaining and weird
I would love 3 long videos every month this is my fav yt chanel you gotta get to 1m subs immidiatly
At 3 minites and 20 seconds in u can see the astrodude movie poster
First 17 hours gets 11000 likes'
this is a movie
Jupiter says Triton from Neptune
Bro why r all the moons strarting to take over solorballs? Is it now moonblalls?😮
honestly I'm waiting for the moment when moon reveals she's a girl becuase the real name of the moon is 'Luna'
Ganymede in the thumbnail built like am angry bird
Titan thinks he's a planet which sustains life lol
I wish I could join patreon but my parents won’t let me
0:00 i feel bad for saturn
We got the jock dude, sassy one, weird kid and the emo type. My dude jupiter has a whole group of high school sterios in that moon collection. Comment your favorite of the four people
This is litrally fire 🔥  I like character development and the behavior of the moons😂
I will love to see ceres ni part 2
OH I CAN SMELL THE NEXT PATRON EPISODE “The moons of Uranus”
Personalities: Io: Weird And Sick 🤢, Callisto: Arrogant and Chill, Europa: Chill but gets offended like in 4:03 , Ganymede: Big bro figure.
I love the moon bro
I was watching this on patrion
You know It's gonna be a good day when solar balls posts
While Io's density may be the highest of all the moons in the Solar System at 3.53 g/cm^3, it should be noted that Earth's Moon also a very high density compared to others at 3.35 g/cm^3. So the scene where Io uses its gravity to fling Earth's Moon around is extremely unrealistic.
I cannot join cuz i,m a child 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Jupiter is a w
I love 2 pebbles phobos and deimos, their voices are so cute. Maybe you can add some moons like Triton or some moons of Uranus(this is my thinking)
Hey! Io sounds just like the sun!
OMGGG JUPITER'S MOONS ARE SO PRETTY
Triton 💀
Kaboom
Good 😊
Moon rebellion
After seeing those moons now I understand why Rick Sanchez got some adventures with that planet
Finally1!!1!1!!1!1!1!!1!1!1!!1!
YAY
They Have Cute 🥺 Voice
I hope Ganymede puts Earth in his place.
I like weirdo more than neptune
Callisto is like Wednesday 💀
I already saw a lot of these
Ganymede: "Your so dumb that you should become the next ring of saturn" Titan: " Well unlike you, I actually have *A LIFE.* "
The earths moon is too cute ☺️
What happened to triton?
Salad could have life
And why did titan look so mad
These Moons are more interesting than the planets, please keep making these!
Wednesday + Raven = Callisto
Please make part 2 fast
2:14 jupiter has Reading 🗿

OMGGG I'M GOING TO CRYYYYY, GANYMEDES IS SOOOOSOSOSUSJSHNSBSNSBSNSHSHS
6:21 would be cool if Moon/Luna/Earth's Moon used the dark side of him
Planet rizzz
Titan out here trying to start a solar war just because of earths insults💀
1:28 😂
Lance ethan
This has nothing to do with the video but i just had a shower thought, since venus is made fun of for being the goddess of beauty then what about earth being a evil titan mom
Ganymede - high school jock Europa - Popular girl Io - weird kid Callisto - goth girl
Phobos and Damone sounds so freaking cute!!!!!!!!! 🥰 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Bro left us on a cliffhanger💀
I love your videos

Please make part 2
Oh boy this is gonna be an arc to
Can't wait to see Triton, Larissa, Proteus and Nereid 💫
@SolarBalls can youu for episode two for the jupitarian moons, can you make the dark side of the moon fight io and show justice on io, and make ganymede fight titan and have it be an epic one and 1 minute during the fight, earth will smack ganymede. @SolarBalls, can you make that for the 2nd episode of moons of Jupiter? It can/couuld go viral.🤔🤔
early
2:57 now I want that joke episode
guys theres A  Black hole at the top supporter down left BRUUUUUHHHH
i bet europa and ganymede are together 😂
6:25 WHAT THE HECK IS THAT NOISE
Mr Earth 2:58
“Will do babe” Got me rolling on the floor
Callisto is So Emo
Its crazy how solar balls have many videos but we still dont know astro dude real name is.
Jupiters basically the dad of these 4 5:13
Ganymede vs Titan . This is gonna be so much fun
If titan had something he was proud of and someone could potentially be better at it then he would understand why the earth snapped when mars said all those things
8:03 Saturn spinning
For anyone wondering the Triton thing, Triton is one of Neptune's moons and it has a retrograde orbit, it means that he circles in the opposite direction to Neptune's rotation, therefore implying that it was an external celestial body from the kuiper belt that was captured by Neptune's gravity, that's why Jupiter brought that up
0:47 😱 IAPETUS SPOKE
Yikes, I dont like how Jupiter gets points for being dumb in this video, I always saw Jupiter as the very smart one, and the youtube channel Uranus Madness agrees with me, in one of their videos, Jupiter gets no points for being dunce.
Fight Scene!
Shit is About to Go Down
When part 2? 🧐
Callisto kind of look like Raven from Teen Titans 🤔
Who’s bigger?
Enceladus is now encilada💀
Did you know there is anotger ice giant in the far away orbiting the sun well hes name is Planet 9 well thats his name
Fun fact: While Ganymede is the biggest moon in the solar system, Titan is actually the second biggest, and both have water, so the build off of a rivarly between them doesn't seem out of the ordinary
Cool but..... I can't used bc mine only 10 😿
2:40: GUYS WE HAVE THE DEBUT OF ALAN BECKER ON SOLARBALLS! THIS IS EPIC!
Im sorry, MOVIE?!?!
Europe is a female as I excpected
When the earth said I sent all my humans in to space first to colonise a plant wins a bazillion dollars he sounds like Mr beast
I CHANGE MY MIND SCRAP URANUS IO IS THE NEW BEST CHARACTER
Jupiter literally best father
mr beast earth
Skip the patreon . 4:00
After the moons of Jupiter 2 Venus vs mars is here. I just know Venus vs mars is coming sometime Trust me.
Io is really active............. and squeaky..... and we finally hear Iapetus...... and we see Io is a big coward....
Discord? No youtube
JUPITER AS A CHAD OF A DAD
Learn about space in school❌ learning from solarballs ✅
Not only does this YouTuber has funny videos he also tells us fun fact
Goodbye disappointed
Io is very energrtic and funny I like him😊
Are we gonna have a moon revolution?
Gender male
What’s mythos? The book that Jupiter is reading
I feel like the moons are a perfect representation of the lgbtq community
Ganymede vs Titan *insert anime battle music*
Stop putting mouths on planetballs, you've already ruined the planetball community
Just when it reached the end and that moon said he was the biggest moon I had urges to put in a "TRIGGERED" Meme onto Titan
Callisto is a mood. I love her
2:58 MISTER EAAAAAAARRTHHH!!!!!     ded meme I know. But anyway that IS kinda cool.
Haha untung bisa bahasa inggris sedikit demi sedikit
Oh my god the screen is shaking 😱7:46 from Ganymedes size
Titan >> Ganyemede
hey guys
Hmmmm my eyes suggest Titian’s gonna start a protest
Like..... the best vid ever!!!!!❤
I really wish to watch next epissodes
I very how like it when Ganymede and Titan do a showdown like from The good The bad and The ugly
I loved all the interactions in this one. Seeing Ganymede and Titan form a rivalry is going to be interesting
im about to cri cuz the cliffhanger
0:00 the video starts  0:27 Jupiter moons meet Saturns moons 1:30 Jupiter 4 moons want to find titan 2:04 Jupiter 4 moons ask Jupiter they can find titan 2:41 an add shows up (not really an ad) 2:51 Solarballs want to post longer videos (they announce) 3:04 earth announce the first human to colonize a plant win up to zillion dollars (not real life) 3:11 they announce if people Join solarballs in patreon they will make 3 long per month + get rewards  3:21 they announce the rewards are early content behind missing deleted scenes your name in the credits tutorials on the creator on how to make your own animated show and an exclusive look at the developments of the Astro dude movie 3:40 they announce the tiers the tiers are comet moon planet and star 3:50 they announce the tiers are limited amount of people can join plant is 50 star is 10 idk the moon tier and the comet tier 4:03 back to video 4:48 Jupiter we get to know Jupiter moons are biggest moons and the solar system idk is that true or not true 4:55 Ganymede says the partners  5:35 Ganymede announced he only know how to says 4 Jupiter moons 5:37 Ganymede announces to say himself 5:38 Ganymede announces he know how to say Europa 6:05 IO announces he’s the most geologically active object in the entire solar system 6:12 IO and Callisto found earth’s moon 6:29 IO announce he’s densest moon and has the strongest surface gravity 6:51 Callisto ask earth’s moon have he seen titan 7:11 IO and Callisto returns to Jupiter  7:21 IO and Callisto follows the earth’s moon (we don’t get to see it) 7:45 Ganymede and Europa found titan 7:57 Ganymede announces he’s the biggest moon in the solar system 8:04 the end credits  8:20 the video ends
Will do babe
IAPETUS
2:20 Oh, you'll know what he's talking about. Just wait until we meet, I'll tell you the full story by then.
I love this new gang already. The big four moons have such unique characteristics, and their designs are all beautiful. Just look at their pattern, beautiful coloring and so unique. I’d love to see them a lot. I’m wondering how is Titan going to feel when he finds out Europa is another moon suspected to have life under her surface, but I guess he needs to pass a beef of being the biggest with Ganymede first.
Battle?!?!??!
The ending was just so good 😂, competition has risen
The fact that like that rude jupiters moon just called diomi babe💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Great first episode 👍
6:17
5:06 LETS GOO WAHOOOO
Biggest moon in the solar system **yawn**. Titan has LIFE 🥱
This was a great episode, and I like the personalities of the moons, from Ganymede being like a jock, Europa being sassy, Callisto being emo/dark and Io being jolly yet coughing.
Wow
SATURNS BIGGEST MOON … VS …. JUPITERS BIGGEST MOON
I will see who the biggest moon is ganimi or titan
The astroids passing by Europa and ganymede was prob ceres
Can't wait for Part 2!!
I understand why Ganymede had such a big ego. He is bigger than Mercury?
Why does Ganymede looks like he wants beef wasnt he only supposed to find titan
I like the personality’s of Jupiters moons
Thanks solar Balls for including Jupiter moons.
Imagine if we got 20 minute long videos
😊😊😊
Ganymede: The moon who attempts to rizz up other moons 💀💀💀💀
Ganymede got the moon rizz
I like the beef btw titan and  Ganymede 😂
😊
1:17🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
I do enjoy seeing new faces for this series, like the moons of Jupiter getting some screentime for once. Cool stuff. Wonder if some time in the far future, once we have 100% proof of what other planets exist in other star systems, we might even see stories with those planets...  Uhm... That is... Unless we get planet names like "Alpha Centauri B b" or stuff like that, for simplicity reasons that is... And, well... That'd be both confusing and boring... Hmm... What about making a video featuring Nibiru?... Or is that too vauge? Like... "Nibiru" or "Planet 9" or "Planet X" or whatever conspiracy theorist calls that thing, seemingly cannot agree on whether if this thing is an asteroid, a planet, a gas giant or a separate star system all together... Could be  a fun concept for an episode for Halloween, right? Ha ha. XD
I wanted Jupiter to talk about the triton story becuase triton is a moon of Neptune and Jupiter never talks or mentions Neptune maybe when they return they can maybe talk about triton also triton was a dwarf planet witch got to close to Neptune therefore neptune captured triton from the Kuiper belt
Dude Deimos and Phobos are SO CUTE❤🎉😊😊😊😊
7:22 Hello boss!
the cliffhanger is INSANE
love
It looked really graphic when titan and ganamede met
Im the CIA
Im the CIA
ganymede now is my favorite ❤️
Hello
Who else here now his favorite character is ganymede?
W U T S T HE P L A N G A N Y M E D E
3:04 rich earth
Hi 👇🏻😎
2:15 Jupiter, I know your talking about me.
I love how there making fun of me beast
1:18 eye twitches
I Love how callisto is just the one not caring about life
P
THEY DID IT, THEY MADE THE MOONS OF JUPITER!
Ganymede's a b****
Your videos all are cool :)
When are you going to make that Venus vs. Mars episode and My episode where earth apologizes to Titan
I like how Jupiter and Saturn are still talking in the background. Gives more flavor to the episode.
Europa and Ganymede sitting in a tree k I s s I n g
6:25 I wonder how long it will take for the YTP'ers to use this scene
why no Amalthea??  pls make an appearance for Amalthea, Thebe, Leda, and Himalia
Will this be like the titan saga
0:48 the first time hearing Iapetus talking
Io is literally Covid day 1
Can you make me a custom planet and put it in a video I want it to look like a big ice ball and if you go where he is you will instantly freeze also I want him to have rings
Wait there is space child predator ? 💀
Wow wow wow it’s cool!!!
i dont have money im just a kid using my dads account sorry i cant join :(
Funny fact. Mercury heavier than Titan and Ganimede combined (~90% Mercury's weight)
Io and Neptune a match made in heaven
the last moment 👀👀👀👁👁👁👁👀👁👀
This first part is like a dream that ends right as it gets interesting
Wait, a movie...  WHAT THE HECK!
Man did you see deimos at 2:35
I like how all the Jupiter's moons act like total bitches , but have such dynamic personalities
I hope we got a video on the big bang soon, anyway titan...titan..... why are you so absesed with life
When planets have relationships
Is io in the planet wrestling league those moves are insane bro threw the moon like in wrestling
Saturn is obsessed with Titan
Ganymede, whatever you want to do with Titan, just dont make a planet
Triton? That's Neptune's moon. Now _that_ I'd like to see.
Is nobody talking about how Phobos and Deimos are genuinely really cute in this?
7:09 Bye Io you and the sun could be friends.
6:32 Io he sounds like the sun.
6:22 Don’t everyone see that io looks like the sun and sound like him.
1:16 wth man
He sounds like the sun and acts like the sun they must be friends.
Io knows martial arts, beware! XD
Hey Uranus creates different moons of jupiter
So what was Jupiter going to say about Triton?
My question is can earthlings hear this they should be loud
8:21
that was interesting.  so i'm a literature nerd and writer who keeps getting this channel reccomended to me for whatever reason. to get youtube to shut up, i tried binge watching a few solarballs videos. it was a lot better then i expected for a show with talking planets. i had no idea another video was about to come out basically a day after i did this binge, yet one did! i'm really glad solarballs is sticking with "the titan arc." i feel iffy about a good portion of the arc because of how titan and earth's relations feel like a racism allegory, and it probably is. a bit weird to create a racism allegory between planets and the objects that orbit them, but it was handled pretty well and with sensitivity nonetheless. and as long as it's taken with sensitivity, then it's alright. i've watched a few fanmade videos where the moons basically stage a nongovernmental coup d'etat against the planets. pretty please, if the solarballs writer(s) is/are reading this, do not do this if i'm correct about the titan arc being intended as something of a racism or general discrimination allegory. but the titan arc is absolutely still the best thing to come out of solarballs writing-wise. because it has an actual, overarching story that connects with multiple other plots. it's not episodic; you can't just watch one. that's a good thing. and the moons of jupiter pt 1 is more of a continuation of the titan arc than a complete beginning of a new one. woo! main complaint: the personalities given to the gallilean moons are a bit cliché. callisto is a wednesday adams kinnie, aka an "i'm tired of everything, leave me alone or i will hurt you" emo/goth. europa is the on-tiktok-24/7 girl who makes wednesday edits and took wednesday's personality for a week before switching back to her teenage girl self and bullying alternative people. aka supporting character in an adolescent show who's a girl. ganymede is the boss. the leader. the top notch school bully. he thinks he's entitled, and the rest of the moons support him being entitled. is also in a relationship with europa, which despite it being mentioned only thrice makes me hate ganymede. and then there's io. his iq is measured in 1 digit. io is not important. these are writing archetypes. you can and will find these anywhere and everywhere. though given, we've only seen 7 minutes of content with the gallileans, so maybe there'll be growth. maybe. solarballs does have a tendency to write lackluster secondary characters. crossing my fingers here, please do not just make writing easier and make the moons' characters one dimensional. especially if they're going to be playing a major role in this next stage of the titan arc, which it looks like they will. that complaint out of the way, i'm confused on what direction the relationhip between ganymede and europa will take. it looks like, at least with the little content where this relationship is expanded on, it'll become a plot B. if so, oh well. i don't mind wherever it goes, but it looks interesting. "if you ask me, i think titan is a big fan [of the earth.]" of course he is! titan probably gets more freedom to look around. he's seen that earth has life. he's seen how annoying earth is too, but it's clear titan still looks up to earth – mainly the earth he thought earth was. that's why he needed to get astrodude to find life under his surface. that's titan trying to prove himself. speaking of earth, i have a vendetta for when people try to justify earth's actions because he has humans harming him. just because someone has issues, doesn't mean them doing bad things is okay. back to the video that this is about, jupiter is just reading a book called mythos. as in, ancient mythology in general. of course he is. he's so real for that. it looks like we're getting an io, callisto, and moon trio? that could be promising! i am really excited if that continues! moving on to the scene with the martian moons and titan, it looks like titan is making protest signs. if so, let titan cook. as long as it doesn't go the route of titan trying to kill earth. again please do not do the coup, but a protest of some sort against earth could be interesting. will probably end in violence, but that was going to happen anyway. because titan and ganymede are enemies now! woah! thrilling. ganymede got threatened by titan because titan was being his aspiring self, and now ganymede is out to get titan. so ganymede and earth will probably be buddy-buddy, at least until earth no longer benefits from ganymede. the ganymede and titan duo will be fun to watch! those are most of my thoughts on the moons of jupiter pt 1. maybe i'll make another essay on part 2. i probably won't though. let's see what tumblr has to say about solarballs. *click sound effect* WOAH GOOD FANART??
Solar balls once again dissapointing us with their lazy designs
😆
Why does IO cough so much?
❤
Wow, ypu released this episode when the moons of jupiter standed in an almost perfect line
inam ghafoor how to add korte bolbi.ok
2:50 oh yes sirrrrrrr
I think Ganymede is bigger than titan by 2%
can't wait for part 2
Can you please give us part 2 and maybe 3
Episode supreme Bros
Space fact! Jupiter has more than 2x the mass of everything else in the solar system, and has a 2.5g surface gravity. Io is only 20% further from Jupiter than Luna is from Earth. This causes extreme tidal effects, which is what makes Io so spicy. Technically, if he goes far away from Jupiter, the geological activity would calm down significantly.
I already had a feeling that Ganymede and Titan were not going to get along.
Looks like someone has a crush 😬
I love this channel
IO: let’s go wahoooo Callisto: yay….. T_T  I love that part 5:06   Gorgeous 😂 5:29
This is the best
I like how Solar Balls updated the number of moons. Cause in "Is Moon really leaving us?" It was said Jupiter has ≈80 moons (79 to be exact) but now Europa updated us and said it is 93 now. Also Triton refrence was AMAZING. I want to see him too. I know you are planning Moon revolution episode, so Triton pleese. Uranus' moons are irrelavent cause none of them are bigger then Pluto but they would be lovely to see. Also, I know it is just a name but if you are going to ship celestial boddies Titan x Titania? And another thing Europa is right, ander the gas Jupiter has just a small core.
Pls make phobos and deimos plushies
Who will win?  The biggest moon, or , the second biggest moon that also has life ( in the mr spherical universe )
Ganymede and Europa flirting is weird, cause s■x for planets is just collision. Also Titan-Ganymede rivarly is so intense from the beggining. Also aren't Ganymede and Europa, siblings? Everyone else makes moons of same planets siblings. But you make them lovers?
Honestly, I did not expect Titan to be leading a team of moons! This can be a movie honestly! It probably is already so yk. But still amazing episode!
The skip button actually managed to escape my finger
What is titan up to!!?😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
Ok nu ya vso ponal, i voobshe, zachem ya suda pishu?
Europa feeling: 🙂 Io feeling: 🤩 Ganymede feeling: 😎 Callisto feeling: 😒
Jupiter's moons seem to be rude
0:47 lapetus spoke
Finally saturns moons and jupiters moons got more screen time
a rivalry of size, gravity and influence, it will be very interesting
Drama
Titan is so goofy that he stopped talking
baa i skipped ad! hold a sec why its paused...    ,btw it makes no sence for io to still be geologically active outside of jupiter's gravity well
old micdonlod have a farm eee i a o uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Uranus is here dream has came true😂
Wait this video four hours come out and you are a type 20 hours
Triton does not talk to planets and does not make contact
The fact that they mentioned triton I have a feeling moons of Neptune are coming
Les go
4 hours old
Ganymedes has such a crush on Dione! 😂
For anyone wondering what was that thingy over there in 5:45 that was mars moon. Not ceres
6:17 this part always make me laugh 😅
Solar Moon assemble
Please give io some medicine
Io acts like sun 🤣
Io voice sounds like sun
I am in confusion
Thank you so much for making this about jupiter's moons, I really appreciate that!
Do you know triton has one eye and very grumpy
I knew Exoplanets were canon in solarballs!
Can we be the narrator in the Astro dude movie?
Good video.
Saturn bro
the fact that earth became mrbeast XD
I feel bad for Saturn Jupiter is always like a good brother  also hey solarballs
OH OH OH I LOVED THIS EPISODE!!!  Backing to the Titan Revolution history on entire solar system!!!
Can’t wait to see Neptune
Moon civil war: COMING SOON
YAY
ganymede x europa fr???
Oh boy this is getting exciting
Titan Vs Ganymede? W🎉
How did i miss this...
Bro ended it at a cliff hanger
Finally it has premired ^_^
PLEASE PLLLLEEAASSEE RELEASE URANUS AND NEPTUNES MOONS THIS IS GREAT KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
I love how they treat Ganymede as a high school bully
The story telling with this is soo entertaining and creative. Like when ganamede said babe and both of the girl moons were about to let him have it. Lol.
Who else got freaked out bc how Intisting this ep endet
I gotta be honest. I dont like how they introduced these characters
NAHH BRO THE ENDING WAS A MASTERPIECE GOT ME LAUGHING 🤣👌❤
Saturn is depressed
MYTHOS?!
Omg IO have amazing abilities and skills  :O
Lets goooo. Another vid!
FINALLY A TRUE COMPETITOR FOR TITAN YESSSSSSSS
5:46 me: HECK IT LES GO SEIRES IS BA- hold up that kinda looks like one of mars’ moons  (Edit) I just realized I totally screwed up spelling Ceres’ name, and Callistos
I love this episode can't wait for the next one also the tension of Titan and Ganymede 👀
Need more
Ganymede and titan are about to start smooching I swear
Hey shut up Europa Jupiter is a huge planet bigger than you.
This episode is great!!
I love how Jupiter thinks oh his moons as his sons it's cute
The ultimate planet showdown.
I watched all,you're video's and there amazing
Sorry i forgot it :(
oh
3:01 Bro stole mr beasts channel.
Wow I can't wait till they make longer videos this is so good❤❤❤
FINALLY THE JOVIAN MOONS!!
i cant wait for part 2
Umm, Jupiter's moons are named after zeus/Jupiter's lovers... not a very fun fact.
Eventually someone's going to definitely make an Io being sick compilation
you should make a video on a comet
Next episode: meet Neptune s moons
Love these late but long videos
someone just copying you in russia...
We want a war between moons. Name it, the 1st great nin... moon war!
I really did not think that the Galilean Moons would be like that, and Ganymede looks like it could be a burden to Titan, but hey, I like it though, maybe they will show Triton too, hopefully soon
I LOVE THIS! CAN'T WAIT FOR PART 2!
If Jupiter thinks that Triton is dead, then I guess that he might come along later in the story, as a suprise character. Just saying, as in real life Triton is still around.
Bruh Cliffhanger
Hold up! The dr and the sponsor narrator (2:42) are the same person?
Don't do is to me why did it end i love this keep it up
Who is excited for part 2😊 👇
Iapetus
I can't wait for part 2 Also Ganymede is speaking facts about earth 🌎
*Is this the Krusty Krab?*
SO COOL
I'm going to love longer videos every month cuz I'm a big fan of this whole entire series I'm just waiting for new videos 😀😀😀
We Might Just See A War Between Titan And Ganymede. But Ganymede Hates Earth So IDK. But I'm Wondering What Is Moon Showing? Maybe It's Ceres Or Earth Etc.
This episode is aweosme.
FINALLY, IAPETUS SPEAKS
i love this
These are the types of videos I wished my Elementary School Science Teacher would show.
Now I have to see what happened to Triton.
The tension.
omg real
2:58 he said “humans”
5:10
When the video starts I hear Jupiter's voice different.
I think a new rivalry begins!!  But whatever happens sun at behind doesn't cares 🌝
YO it happened
I’ve never seen Saturn so mad b4…man Iapetes sounds hot.  Man Callisto, IO, And Europa are amazing. ALSO I JUST WANTED TO SAY- I THINK IO HAS FRIGGIN COVID 19. Also Callisto is just such a mood.
im surprised how u guys did Jupiters moons they are reallyy of not  how I thought u were gonna do. them
Cliffhangers suck
I can't wait to see how Titan and Ganymede's relationships evolve. Will they be rivals? Will they truce over mutual hatred of planets? I wanna see.
Fun fact now Saturn has 164 moons as nasa discovered them in the rings of Saturn but idk how much Jupiter has
Io  is funny Ngl
The legendary battle gonna starts
I wish we have more episodes giving more spotlight to planets moons like this
It’s 94 moons Europa
Bro mocked MrBeast in their patreon promo 💀

“Titan is missing!?” 😳  That’s memorable to irl.
Boy I can't wait for part 2
Don't let Mercury see Ganymede. He's going to have the worst existential episode yet.
IO sounds a lot like failboat weirdly
I like these new characters. Can't wait to see more of them.
If you guys team titan thumbs up
FINALLY
You should put the option to listen in Spanish as well as Mr Beast puts his videos, it would be cool
Is so silly io (♡v♡) Why callisto is so emo💀
early
The Story thickens
Are the moons about to  start a Rebellion or something? This arc is becoming interesting. Hope Dwarf Planets also start joining
A pure pleasure for this episode, Can't wait for the sequel 🤩 I like the fact that there are the moons of Jupiter, more characters !
Even moons are flirting when I'm still single
I love how Ganymede is the leader
nobody is noticing this but there is a boneworks easter egg at 2:05 which is mythos [the book jupiter is reading] and i'm not gonna spoil boneworks vr but mythos is a simulation that arthur ford [main character] uses to go to boneworks [this game is for vr headsets only made by stress level zero]
I am on Patreon and the first minute of part two is already good😊
poor Timmy
This episode had a lot of firsts: first mention of exoplanets, first mention of Triton, and first time a planet used its gravity to fling another.
Hiiiiiiii
Finally we get juipiter moons
Not sure how I feel about Ganymede or Io, but I will say Europa and Callisto are perfect!
dang titan and ganymede finnally met i know i dont know ganymedes spelling dont correct me but this is interesting
Revolution! Revolution!
Can the evil side of the moon scare IO?  Also how is the moon separated from earth when they are locked with gravitational force?
JUPITER,S MOONS
1:31 Io coughs 1:56 Io has a cold 5:02 Io has COVID-19  5:57 Io has a seizure 6:07 Io is about to end up in the hospital 6:17 Io sneezes on the moon 7:09 Io has asthma                                         To be continued will Io end up in the hospital in the next part?                                                        P.S. I will comment more of this Io stuff in the next part!
why do I get the feeling that titan is going to start a moon  rebellion?
Bruh they left us on a cliff hanger wow ;-;
Why yall did Mr Beats dirty like that💀
WOAH! to be honest.. this seems way more interesting as we dig in more.. so much stuff is about to happen!
Why'd y'all have to make Ganymede a jerk
IAPETUS IS TALKING?!
Yo I like Io he hilarious Callisto is pretty cool and for some reason relatable
The fact that Ganymede acts like a leader/boss just because he's the largest Jovian moon and the largest moon in the Solar System
Will titan ever meet saturn again
lol
Please translate the long videos into Spanish
YES! Finally
This is way exiting than   Astronomy class 🤤
Not a cliffhanger!  NNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
AAAA THANK YOU SOLAR BALLS❤
IO needs a docter
is it just me or do jupiter's moons have a more shiny texeture than saturn's ones
You guys have to tell me what happened to triton! I thought that Neptune’s moon!! I wanna know how it got kidnapped and what type of interaction happened 😭
You Guys Has Some Good Videos 👍
Nice.
I love this you will to
Did they saw Ceres or something
:)
People who skipped the add | | | | V
CHANGE EUROPAS VOICE
Yay Jupiter!
You’ve got to be kidding, you left it on a cliffhanger
I'm looking forward to seeing fight scenes.
Most celebrities:don't care at all  A freaking female talking moon: absolutely beautiful
Yooo
Somehow made someone more annoying and cocky than earth
Isn’t Titan bigger that Ganamede
Good solar ball for making moons dating
1:16 moments before disaster
i was about to here my favorite moon I heard
i thought ganymede and europa were siblings- but this episode is fantastic!!!
5:46-5:51 it’s Phobos and Deimos the Moons  of Mars
Jupiter has 79 moons why are there only four  moons
If some of y’all have an oc moon type it out❤ Mine is Sepia (Sun’s Moon)
when is the next episode
Titan ain't happy with those words who is actually the biggest moon in the solar system I'm going to look it up real quick okay so it looks like Ganymede is the biggest  Titan is just a little small but not small Titan needs to be 2% bigger to be the biggest
Titan: "Im not your boss"  Ill give him 4 more episodes for him to change his tune
LOVE THIS EPISODE
Io should be a girl
Now you be copyin' my videos
Jupiter is the size of Earth in Solarballs compared to the Sun
IT’S CANON!
TRITON MENTIONED AHHHHH YES
I am waiting for the dark side of the moon to be the gangsta of solar system 😂😂😂, and all other moon's are scared of him. It will be cool.
Так это русское или американское? So is it Russia or american?
boneworks reference 2:13 Jupiter's book
Ofcourse titan will be pissed by Ganymede showing up. It was believed to be the largest moon in the solar system for a long time before discovering that ganymede is a little bit bigger.
I'm in the airport watching this👍👍👍👍👍
At least Jupiter a loving caring father to his moon
Europa
Why is Ganymede acting like tuco from breaking bad☠
Tarqeq
No Saturn killed 1 moon to form its rings
Telesto
Gotta love Ganymedes personality, and Europa relationship with him is cute
Theory, Titan and Genymede are gonna have a rivalry, because Genymede is just a 150 km bigger than Titan, but Titan has the resources for life to begin…
Epimetheus
Hyperion
Titan: **literal death stare** Ganymede: watchu know 'bout rollin down in the deep 🔥🔥🔥💯💯
Rhea have rings so... give her rings? 👉👈🥺
tethys
lapetus
Dione
Mimas
WHY DO I KEEP MISSING MORE VIDEOS 😭😭😭😭
It's official: Io is the sun of the moons.
Enceladus
Io sounds like scooby doo
I could see this series becoming similar to alphabet lore, becoming popular over the entire internet. ITS SOOOO GOOODDD!!!
My name is ioane and short name is io
Callisto
Io
Ganymede
Finally u guys gave Iapetus a voice! Keep it up @Solarballs
@SolarBalls  You see this You see this  THIS...           Is the Reason Why i like Astronomy 🌌🌍🌎🌏🪐🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘🌞🌝🌚
Titan
hi
Ferdinand
Prometheus
That end.......                                                    Moore episodes!
Finally an mini adventure episode
Update: In earlier episodes of the Titan series, Saturn is said to have 83 moons. In May 2023, 62 new moons were discovered so Saturn now has 145 of them. Update 2: In June 2023 a new moon was discovered so the correct number is 146. Welcome to the team.
RESPECT to our man solar balls for awsome content!!!
6:17 bro got that space bending Or gravity bending
1 hr ago
Moon's civil war? 😱😱😱😱
1:18 will do babe Both: What?! 🤨
no one will like it
The Mr Beast reference part...😂😂👌👌
Titan needs to Ganymede...The moon revolution is more near 🌓⚔
I love Jupiters' moons gang and how cool he treats them.  Also big fan of Callisto being the "goth dark tired out girl" xDDDDDD    Looks like a moon strike is on the way... or maybe an ego fight netween Ganimede and Titan 😅lol
@Solarballs can I ask if a teenager can join the patreon membership
watch out for me-
IO best character
"Anime Music Battle Kicks In"
Op
Ganymede may be larger and heavier and it has a magnetic field similar to Earth (albeit weaker) but Titan has a thick atmosphere and oceans of Liquid Methane, so I think he’s cooler.
uhhhhn we have not met you jupiters moons so before we saw you, you didn't exsit, soooooo blah
Last episode was the 69th Episode
When is da movie coming to youtube
Imagine the moons is the villains💀💀💀
I was wondering where titan was.
I just love how everything look so big from moons perspective in the asteroid belt and I like how sun is just in the background smiling
that ending was like:   |:)   (:<
Went part 2 is coming 😮
1:17 💀 shippers already gone wild  6:24 planets can canonically fight now 4:22 nah cringe emo 5:11 nahh no way bro is already cheating 💀💀 5:35 nvm he rizzed her back up
All the time when thing get interesting. It all ends💀☠️🙂
"search for Timmie"
I've just realised that they have much, much deeper personalities, and I respect that.
we see jupiter is one of the nicest and chillest planets, i would friend him
This was a amazing episode! Io has to be my favorite now!
Bro, this video was released 1 hour ago and I'm seeing comments that was like 10+ hours ago...
i love saturn and jupiters friendship sm
Ah yes the moons of saturn and jupiter forming a group
Ganymade
Once on a time an enguine was afraid of a few drops of rain
THIS IS SO GOOD THE TEAM DID A GREAT JOB
Nah titans a giga chad
A absolute masterpiece of yours. I like how you build up the characteristics of Ganymede.
Not only the episode was good. But thank you for also making me laugh on 0:39. I literally fell off laughing. Keep it up solar balls
Bro I love where this is heading, I hope it doesn't disappoint
What i think to the galileion moons:  Callisto:scary asf Europa:popular girl asf Io:weird asf Ganymede:simp asf
😉👌 cooler than your many videos
Ganymede looks like that one bully in the 2000's, just look at his grin at the end!
Ganymede is really flirty first diomi then Europa (and I guess she likes him too and was jealous when he flirts with diomi )
NO DONT END IT LIKE THAT
PART TWO BEFORE THE EARTH EXPLODES AND I KILL MYSELF
Mama mia continue faster i need to show this am to tired bruh
titan's villain arc, part 2
Fun fact, Jupiter may have around 600 moons. But that just astronomer's calculation, there might be less or more, who knows
I wish i could support your patreon but im broke🥲
hola I mean hello
hello
Amazing!
Noopoo
Oh my God
I like io the moon of jupiter
0:47 his voice 🤭🤭
How can Phobos and Deimos be scared of the asteroid belt if they were asteroids?…..Unless they were scared and asked Mars if they could be his moons?
0:54 I couldn’t agree more 😂
Should have let Jupiter tell about Triton!
xD
seems like a face-off between 2 largest moons . . . I wonder where this will lead . . . also io's sulphut spit is pretty weird for a character , but it is a nice refference to something he does all the time , . . . . aslo another interesting thing about io is it's extraordinarily hot lava . whitch in some places is over 500c hotter than basalt on earth
Hi
earth moon name is luna
Can we appreciate how SolarBalls make these videos to make us not bored?
That’s crazy
I cant wait for part 2 it is gonna be so cool
There are 95 moons of Jupiter with confirmed orbits as of March 2023, thought to be shed from the inner moons, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized outer irregular moons that were only briefly captured by telescopes 🔭. Jupiter’s moons form a satellite system called the Jovian System. The most massive of them in order from Biggest to smallest: Ganymede, Callisto, Io, Europa, the BIGGEST of all, Ganymede, is the Largest Moon of the Solar System about radius (Size) of 1635 miles (2631 km).   I really like this video, this is so AMAZING!!! I hope there is Part 2 of that.
I can't believe how much happened in one 8 minute video. This genuinely felt like it was 20 minutes! Love it!
HI
This Is EpIK I always wanna see the moons of Jupiter
XD siuuu
Hey solarballs! I like ur videos so much. Every u upload i watched it. I never forget. Thank you solarballs for make me smile again :)
I like the relationship between Jupiter and his moons, he’s like a father to them
E
1:17 we'll do babe😂😂❤
Man this special video is soo good right guys
FUCK! YOU CLIFFHANGING- IT WAS GETTING GOOD!!!
I love the moons of Jupiter
Hello there
Titan vs Ganymede
This was a good video
hehe, i like theese moons also, moon shipping?? heck yea
I love this episode so much!!! I'm looking forward for part 2 <333
Mr earth bro
I always wandering what happen if titan become a Earth's moon ,with Atmosfer and Water in Down surface also entering the Goldilocks Zone will titan habitable?
OMG THEY DID IT!!
Lol
Il nous faut une suite
Amazing
1:16 New ship?
I love this episode :D It's amazing 👍
Bro said 'Will Do Babe' infront of 2 moon 💀
8 MIN VIDEO
You know? There's barely any asteroids in the main asteroid belt yes yes I know there is a lot but the few and far between and I know I'm a nerd 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓 also I known this from be amazed
Europa is right, Jupiter Saturn Uranus have a sold surface but Neptune doesn’t.
I hope after this  there is the moons of uranus
The one that went speed was mars's moons
I hope one of these episodes we get to see trappist-1!
Good episode
0:06 his not 1 million years old
You giving characterization to them
YOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hm
Plz get ceres in the next vid btw i luv ur content
Ganymede Vs Titan!
Ganymede got negative rizz
io is so funny, i like how he is coughing 😂😂😂
LORE
Moon Moment
SIUUUUU
Not only does moons stairs also Io
Jupiter is the most wholesome planet on this channel 😍😁
The sun the whole time: 🙂
WAIT JUPITER HAS GLASSES WHAT 😮
I wonder if we will ever get to see exo-planets
Civil war?
BROOOO THIS IS SOOOO GOOD, PROB THE BEST EPISODE YET, THE PERSONALITIES OF THE GALEEN MOONS COULDNT BE BETTER🎉🎉🎉
P E N
man u did us dirty tho
WHOs tritan; make a vid on it
When does episode 2 come out?
W
i honestly feel bad for jupiter and saturn they got fun of by the 4 moons.
The two dating moons are related
We saw Iapetus speak for the first time!
looks like we have another rivalry
Io is indeed weird. It has the most active volcanoes in the solar system and it’s lava is much hotter than on earth. Despite the hot lava, it’s still cold because the ash escapes into space.
Fun fact the moons name is Luna
I love the personality’s of Jupiter’s moons!! Great job as always solarballs!!!😄😄
Justice for Moons of Uranus  👇
Oh Man, i really wanted to know about Triton. ( Neptune's moon)
Solar balls should make IO meet venus
7:48-7:50 That is some real nice animation right there! Just the expression animation with Ganymede 😮🤩👍
Easter egg:Minus sounds a bit like the sun of maybe 1 of the 2 moons of Mars 1:03 Comment me if there’s other planets or moons I’ve missed 😊
utter lunacy
Ganymede got some rizz, it makes him weird but funny
Titan the boss 😂😂😂
Can't wait to see what happened next. Your guys did a great job
This is so good see now
When the earth sent all the people to space it's kind of like Mrbeast video
jupiter is a certified dad in our solar system
THIS WAS AN AMAZING EPISODE!!! I ADORE IT! I LOVE THE DYNAMIC OF THE GALILEAN MOONS TOGETHER!!!  THEY ARE GREAT!!!! 🥰🥰🥰💕💕💕💕👍👍👍👍
Did they add mrbeast
Io’s my favourite one.
Here’s a random fact Jupiter’s smallest moon is 10km in size and called Leda
Imagine an Io, Neptune and Sun interaction
3:47 The video is so outdated (tho it uploaded) 20 mins ago, that the animators and the narrator didn't notice that the high tiers already reached their max amount of people xd (no hate tho no hate)
3:25 It's that a black hole
This is by far my favourite episode, Your guy’s animation skills are getting so good!
They mentioned triton
This is amazing
Bruh, Who would have thought that there'd be such drama between the Moons of the solar system, as they are Cousins after all
Astrodude movie?!
I have feeling that  theres gon be war in the space💀
TRĪTŒEÑ
Who else can't wait to see the astro dude movie
Alright so, Europa likes Ganymede?  I-
MR BEAST EARTH😂
nice
Europa and him are like Fred and Daphne 😂
this video was very funny
Finally leapatus spoke🎉
Cool
Ganymede: cool kid Io: class clown Callisto and Europa: goth kids
2:58 MrBeast in 2070
It's gonna be space battle if the war didn't stop.
GLASSES JUPITER
0:47 IAPETUS SPOKE
These episodes were supposed to funny, but they became more and more intense in every videos.            *_I LOVE IT_*
YAYYY IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG
3:47 HAH I FOUND A BUG
No one: Sun the whole time: 🙂
Astronauts when they see a giant paint brush: "What the heck is that?!"
Alternative ending Ganymede: Will do babe. Dione: What? video ends
MAAAAN THIS WAS FREAKING AWESOMEEE!!
496th here bois
Ah, so this is what was really going on during the 2020 Great Conjunction
Never been this early to a Solar balls vid
Guess Europa doesn't like Earth ;-;
Finally! We got to see Jupiter's four main moons. Worth the wait. The dynamics and interactions between the Galilean Moons are so fun.
Epic
Theaxolotl8645
awesome
Happy Canada's day 🇨🇦
Finally the first girl sollorball character
Who's here before minutes turn to hours?
Ooh i can't wait i really like ganymade
I’ve been waiting so long for this, it’s finally here 🎉
This feels like all the moons are gonna meet up and do something to the plantets
Cool video
20 mins
early
Tbh this is the best channel from the Spherical verse and Human buddy is the most educative!
Who lakes Ganymede
Gang
15 minutes
Nice.
*GAAAAAAAAASP*   WILL THEY BE FRIEND OR FOE?!?! WHO KNOWS?!?!?!?! AAAAAAAAA
OMG IM NOT EVEN CLOSE TO FINISHED WATCHING THE EPISODE AN JUPITER IS WEARING GLASSES Me when my Jupiter design wears glasses: *send help-*
Noooooo cliffhanger whyyyyy😢😢
OMG part one endet so cool in a stare down
Is it just me or  Ganymede is more Jerky than Earth?
I can’t wait for part two
I hope they add Uranus and Neptune moonS
Jupiter is like the chill dad, and his moons are like teenagers
sad saturn is a crime against the universe and shall never be repeated. give saturn a planetary hug.
Io sounds like the Sun with a slight gravely voice
Yass more Mimas lisp
Can we get a video about one of Saturn's moom Tarqeq plz
Cool
Shout out po
16 minutes ago? *SEES COMMENTS FROM 16 HOURS AGO*
Oop I may be wrong at the part they're mini Jupiters (wasn't expecting that) but hey I love the plot twist aha! Ganymede be the typical leader of the gang, somewhat rebellious but outgoing. I liked the detail of IO coughing yellowish clouds, suggesting Sulfur Dioxide is one of the most abundant compounds present in his atmosphere (not to mention the origins could also have something to do with his volcanic nature!)
Well I hope it comes out Next Saturday (Part 2)
1:17 Solarballs… WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Please create part 2 and part 3
Hooooo yippee
Isnt there a moon of Neptune or Uranus that is thouht to have been once a regular planet that was kidnapped by the gas giant the moon now orbits in the opposite direction of the other moons  edit: i regoogled it and i think it is the Triton moon of Neptune
Bro they where weirder than I thought
The sun is always watching.
WHY DID IT HAVE TO CUT-
Waiting for astrodude movie
Titan          Ganemyde 👇                       👇
I love that
I've been waiting to see the moons of Jupiter for so long plus I wish I could support the patreon but I don't have financial freedom yet:( but anyways glad you finally introduced us to the four moons
I love how Ganymede shows up at the end, it presents his largeness well.
Get it! I wanted to see what would happened next. Another perfect video. Good job guys 😃😁😃
that was a great Premiere
This episode 10/10. Jupiter's moons looking for Titan, he planning the revolution and in the end Ganymede and Titan face to face. What will happen? I can't wait for part 2
"Io's personality fits Amalthea more"  Change my mind if you can...
7:58 This scene kinda looks like Titan and Ganymede are enemies
First
I like how the moon is the most popular team on patreon I enjoyed moons of Jupiter! After all this time it's here!
The end was my favorite part
Here before it reaches 10k views 👇  Here after it reaches 10k views                  👇
1:17 - 1:20 discord clip 1 5:06 - 5:10 discord clip 2
When ls part 2?
This is my favorite video
Io as volcanoes heated by the fraction of his tide
I love this!
That all dang
Okay so personalities based on the video:  Ganymede: Average Frat bro, probably has an ego as big as the biggest moon in the solar system (him) Europa: Valley gorl, and probably in a relationship with Ganymede Io: Really hyperactive,and coughs a lot (and my new favorite character) Callisto: Really gothic
Hopefully im not the only one who realizes this  But! I’ve noticed that jupiter was about to mention about what happened to triton, is it about triton getting to neptune’s orbit while it was still a dwarf planet? we’ll see!! (btw love this video, keep up the good work!!)
Hahahha
I LOVE THIS EPISODE! You guys did an amazing job!♥️  And another thing is how they mentioned Triton. I wonder if we're going to get an episode on that sometime in the future.. 🤔
yay
I'm so glad you posted! <33 You never fail to make my day, I laughed quite a lot during the video!  Also, does Io need some cough drops?
Amazing when is part two out
LOVED IT!!!!!‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️AAKAKAKAKKSNSJJSHDUHSJZXHSHJXHDBSGDNAAHN
When's part two?
Isn’t Europa the one that gets its surface ripped apart
nice episode bro
Theory: in the gaps between the episodes titan is starting a campaign or collection moons to destroy earth and maybe titan and Europa are exes
I have a feeling Io is lying and is actually contagious😂
Callisto and Europa are the new girl characters!!!
I know that IO is full of volcanoes, but what kind of gas is he coughing out?
THAT PREMIRE WAS WILD
Best episode
I was late
Ganymede
Titan vs Ganymede I wanna see some duel between them
That was awesome
I LOVE IT!
E
the cliffhanger man
amazing
I hope u will post part 2 VERY SOON
I wonder what’s going to happen after this episode maybe earth could apologize？
Omg 496th!!!1

Great Job Solarball Keep it up And Heart pls
Bruh Edit: ok this comment was 1 year ago so I have no idea why I said "bruh".. but why does genemedes voice sound so different here.. never noticed that
