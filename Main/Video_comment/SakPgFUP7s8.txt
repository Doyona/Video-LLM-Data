Surprising My FAMILY With A Trip To NEW YORK!!
Anastasia Kingsnorth  LOVE LOUIS SHIRLEY
This made me cry 😂
I’m not crying ur crying aw
Julie’s next question?   How man dollars are we getting?!
How does Atticus get the time off school?
I think Atticus has always wanted to go to New York 15:22 , 15:59 , 16:25, 16:32 😂
She is one lovely daughter and very good to her family. ❤
💜
Hope you have fun xx
Bless the nan.....
Memories over gifts anyday!
Such a kind girl 🫶💕💙🥺
You’ll have the best time! I went at the end of January and we had on and off snow over the 5 days I stayed☺️ tip: it’s cheaper to get a yellow/ old school taxi from the airport due to it being a set price compared to other transport! Have the best time✨
Gallaghers steakhouse for their lunch menu is a MUST - the steak is UNREAL and it’s so fancy but only $29 for the set menu at lunch
This is gorgeous. Actually crying
omg i found out my nan was mates with yours, the went to readings etc, i was shocked when i found it out
Are you an official IT girl now ?
I recommend doing the top of the rock in the day and doing empire at night! Completely different views! Also the Central Park zoo is amazing! ❤
Damn it I would love this family trip to New York and have safe  when walking .
Atticus is a lucky little boy! How does he manage to go away during term time? Is he homeschooled?
Hope you have an amazing time in New York 💗❤️✈️
Anastasia Julie Atticus Happy New Year I can’t wait for the New York vlogs I can’t wait to go to New York for my next 21st birthday I hope you have an amazing time in New York ❤️❤️🗽🚕🎉🎉🎊🎊🥳🎆🎇🥂🍾🪩✨✨

Where is the tracksuit you're wearing from?
The reactions were so cute! I’d love to go to New York - That’s so thoughtful of you xx
I went to NYC in February 1999, there still was snow on the ground, skating in Central Park! Have a wonderful time xx
Great gift!
This reminds me of when I surprised my family with a holiday!! So glad I caught their reaction on camera so I could vlog it 🎥😊 Julie and Atticus are so lucky!!! ❤️
have a nice trip!!
Such a nice surprise! Is Atticus school okay with him taking time off in term time? X
I really want Ana to do a pregnancy prank on her mum.I think it would be soooo funny
NEW YORKKKKK
I 100% recommended going to the edge!! It has a far better view than the Empire State and it’s less busy x
She did not just call Central Park centre parks 😂😂😂 twice 😂😂
I saw Harry potter in London, it’s amazing!!
What a wonderful present ❤
I am so excited for this video 😍
One day I’ll do the same for my family 🙌

Love Centre Parcs. which one are you going too? 💗
I've just got back from NY, you'll have the best time!!
I think Julie needs her own New York activity book to tick off like atticus’
I love how much you love a surprise 😂 I’m exactly the same, big libra energy ⚖️
You must go to Katz Deli for that pastrami sandwich. It's famous for it x
Loved the video Ana hope you had an amazing new year x.

I went to New York 5 years ago. Was the best holiday I ever had!

The play is just based off a script, not a normal book like the other Harry potters, hence the book!😊
