And here we are again December 2024
We got battered again 😂😂😂
Anyone here after united got slapped 3-0 again under amorim
Well this just happened again
I thought this was today's highlights (22/12/24), just realising Man Utd have lost to Bournemouth 0-3 at home twice in a row 🤣😂
Thought I was watching todays highlights
Deja vu
As a Utd fan, this should have been the title: Bournemouth DOMINATE shambolic Red Devils at Old Trafford! Man Utd 0-3 Bournemouth - PL Highlights
Bournemouth SHOCK Man Utd! | Man Utd 0-3 Bournemouth | Premier League Highlights
Fantastic cherries 🍒
SOLANKE WINS IT!!!! 🤫 | Manchester United 0-3 AFC Bournemouth | Premier League
Lol
We are Man Utd , We do what we want !  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bournemouth were robbed. It should have ended 5-0. Man united are a laughing stock
Harry fridge
Please sack ten hag
Worst Goalkeeper in Premiership History.
That miss by Solanke is not what Arsenal need...  have too be cold blooded and clinical. No excuse for missing.
crap defending as usual . They didn't do their home work on Bournemouth getting torn apart like that 😢
Why mcguire still there??
Utd's defence was utterly poor, very similar to non-league defences.
Unlucky lose boys we will beat the dirty Liverpool FC though COMMMMMEEEEE ON YOOOOOUUUUU REDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The 4th should've stood. He was being tripped and fouled at the time and the ball was ping'd against him.. 4 nil that was..!!  And hopefully United play like this when we play them..  Come on you reds Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Honest question to Liverpool fans. Would you prefer Man U like they are atm or actually a real rival but we just about get the better of them?
Next Liverpool will destroy YNWA 😂😂😂😂
Yeah ronaldo is the problem :/
Yeah ronaldo is the problem :/
Koibee Manoo must be moved to midfield. Also Hanibal Mejri must be given more playing time
It’s like it’s wrote on a script. 😂
Man Utd definitely neeed this manager "Julian Nagelsmann period ✌️👍😎🔥
The fact Bournemouth could have had about 6 😂😂class
Maguire and luke shaw very poor.
Waow waow! Nissed the game on Saturday and could only watch it today after hearing the result. Had to tuen the acr radio off on the day. That was bad. No wonder the stadium looked empty.
Luke Shaw has really put on some timber must've been training at McDonald's lol 🏐🥅⚽🍣🍤🌮🍟🍔🥐🥮🍧🍨🥧😩
Mctomin is at fault for all the goal
Crazy stat-Alisson has more PL goals than €100M hojlund
Bournemouth are too good for a mid table team like Man NotUnited
Worse is coming. Watch
GG Bournemouth 😂
Congrats to Bonrmouth on such great win.
What's commentary  name
never a handball
Let’s laugh together 😅😅😅😂😂😂
I miss oli
Man Utd need some world class defenders soon. Only problem, no world class player wants to come to United 😂
The gift that keeps on giving 😂
Oh the Man Utd of old….slip sliding down the table. Hilarious 😆 😂😂😂😂
4-0 you donut
'Ronaldo was the issue'
There's the harry mcguire we all know,total mince
Bournemouth's 4 goal, wasn't the a possible penalty anyway?
bet Maguire was glad he wasnt playing....
Wow. I enjoyed that. How different to the Fergie era when teams dreaded a fixture at Old Trafford. Now the away team know that they can get a result.
😂 no wonder Manchester is blue
Disallowing that 4th goal is a disgrace. Its a good job it meant nothing
Ahahahahaahahahahahahahah
They play like that against Bayern Munich and it's going to be very very embarrassing
Cristiano Ronaldo is very responsible for this loss, he doesn't do anything the coach tells him, he's old, he's finished, he doesn't press, he doesn't defend. he remains the problem of Man Utd!
VAR still a disgrace. 4th most definitely should of counted
Wow can’t believe these United players are on stupid money and can’t play football 🙄
They let de gea go for onana. Don't ever forget that 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Starting Martial is the same as starting with 10 men, utterly useless laziest Premier league player by a mile, just stands watching the ball being passed around him
Well done to Bournemouth  Utds goalie being worse than useless ,as well as the other 10 utd players
lol
The Maguire effect.  That disallowed goal the defending was so Harry
But what can ya do when the bench is just as bad as the outfield players, ETH is snookered.! Its not HIS tactics, its the players are from multiple different managers getting 2nd or 3rd choice signings so we have a poor mismatched squad rather than one long term manager getting all his FIRST choice signings in ALL the positions plus a good bench, untill then we are going to scrap our way to the top where we belong.! Patience Padawans.! ✌🏻🫶🏻
0:04 bruno passes there to mctom and he doesn't even shield the ball. Smh
Yes United were bad, but you've got to wonder where Pogba was in all of this. For a £100 million man, he caused nothing but problems in the club. This one's on him
Ronaldo and de gea
That pace from Lewis cook though?😫😂😂
Onana on the second goal Bournemouth with the freedom of OT just running through a nonexistent midfield 😀
This is the man u we love to see - thanks guys!
I am not a Bournemouth fan but am pleased for Dominic Solanke who is FINALLY proving himself good enough in the Premier League.  He's been around for years and I actually thought that he was older than his 26.  I've seen him flop with inconsistency smd injuries at Liverpool and then looking like one of those footballers who were too good for the Championship but not good enough for the Premier League like Patrick Bamford until now. Similar age to Olie Watkins finally showing his stripes
First goal could have been prevented if any one of Shaw, Fernandes, or Arambat actually made an effort. But can almost be forgiven for being early on and still getting into a rhythm. Second goal may have been stopped if Dalot actually tried to block the cross. And the third goal, I don't even think a single utd player jumped for that corner. This is more than just the team not being good enough, this is very much the team just flat out not wanting it. If their performance is anything like this come Tuesday, Bayern are going to set some kind of UCL scoring record.
Pmfsl from a leeds fan haha
73000 at Old Trafford? . . . To watch that rubbish?
Absolutely no way whatsoever that 4th goal should have been disallowed.
Andoni Iraola top manger
Man U fans in the last 2 years:  Casimero: the final piece of the jigsaw, will start competing with a proper DM Lisandro Martinez: The best defender in the league Luke Shaw: English Roberto Carlos Onana: Will transform the way we play with his AMAZING ability on the ball Bruno. Best no.10 in history Antony: Better than Saka Garnacho: Better than Martinelli Rashford: 21/22: Sell him, useless! 22/23: Clear of Mbappe. 23/24. Sell him, useless! Hojlund: The new Haaland ETH: Ten Haag ball, ruthless and a leader  December 2023: Man Utd O - 3 Bournemouth
Man UTD are the most unluckiest team I reckon ever. ETH has tactical mastery, UTD dominate every game, stats are one sided. Opponents get jammy goals and survive. Feel sorry for UTD they're literally playing superior football to anyone. The gods must be against UTD :/
The gift 🎁 that keeps on giving ho ho ho
Do you need some easy points ???...Just go to Old Trafford Store🎁🤷‍♂️
CR7 siiiiiu siiiiu 😂😂😂
Bit harsh to disallow the 4th goal. How's he supposed to get his arm out of the way of the ball there?
Bournemouth took their chances no complaints
Every now and then b’mouth seem to be capable of putting serious fear into fellow prem opponents 😳 First spurs last season, then us last season, but they really hit the jackpot with this one🫢😂
Utd looked very tired too slow and preoccupied…
Like how maguire isn't at fault anymore for these goals
Normal sevice resumed. Could Ten Hag be the worst Man Ure manager of all time?
bravo bournemouth  also no handball there should've been 4-0
Love the commentary at the end, 'they'll settle for 3'  bit of an UNDER STATEMENT 😅
the universe saw ten hag win manager of the month and thought it should tip the scales a little bit back to normal.
SoLanky standing tall. Pardon the pun!😅
Has baldylocks been sacked yet?
That disallowed goal may have save the manager from sacking!
What a pathetic call on the 4th goal
OLD TRAFFORD IS FALLING DOWN 😂😂😂😂
Bournemouth are good at the moment. The only one of their last five games that they haven't won was a draw with Villa, which is a useful result these days. Utd were crap yesterday.
Ladies and gentlemans i present you the manager of the month.
I THINK I COULD DO A BETTER JOB THAN THE MAN UNITED DEFENDERS
I’m a big fan of Manchester United! I can’t believe we are in this position! Should be a shamed everyone it’s in charge and players !
rain caused united lost
☹️
United fans may as well become City fans.  Face less disappointment  More trophies per year  Also it's still in Manchester  Why not? 😅
Why r we all suprised? afterall; An apple never falls far from the tree;  *A Robotic Manager creating robotic proteges in his own image.* (no brain, emotions or heart, just mechanical performances each given match)
Should’ve been 6-0
Really? l mean really? no seriously... REALLY? An t think, that some (if not all) of them players r probably worth MORE in a mth than the whole of Bournemouth together . *Yet f a club that easily parts with 100s of millions each season, u'd never know from the crappiness u get t witness on the pitch each wk.*
That 4th goal is the perfect demonstration of why the amended handball rule is ridiculous and how it is ludicrous in application. The goal should stand. It's minimal contact, totally accidental, negligible whether it gained the player an advantage and it didn't prevent another player from playing the ball. Anyone who has played the game knows this to be true and should see no reason why it should be chalked off.
Man utd trash
Look on the bright side u Utd fans, it ain't all that bad;  *u cudda let 4+ in but f a disallowed goal an the final whistle.*
Liverpool fan here.  Thanks Bournemouth lol  * lights himself a cigar and raises his pint in your direction * 😄
Utd hey; guessing that sometimes, the underdogs really r THAT bad an never fail to disappoint. Mind u, no suprise there as Utd seems t have been accustomed t being regularly MOUTH-ed off each match
Manchester United is like Bank Saving Account for Bournemouth now.
Said for long time harry M should  take leaf out chrs smalling move to italy never know might be good for him......
Theres was a time not so long ago that you would never have dreamed of putting a wager on Bournemouth to win that game. These days I'm not so sure.
Hahahahahahahaha
Man Utd are utter shite
we are united we are the talk of the town win lose or draw that is why you are here commenting 20 times league champions, best supported team in the world ( no team has a higher average attendance fact ) we have got your attention for better or for worse, we are united most famous club on the planet, cheers
Ten Haag you are a LEGEND FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER 😂😂😂
Solankes finish was a joke
I've been feeling really depressed today, so I came here to have a good laugh. 😂
Just imagine being Sir Alex Ferguson watching this man united used to be feared off about every team now look at them its crazy
man u need another handsome rooney
That was hilarious
Gory, Gory, Manc Utd! Bwahahahaha!
Pumped! Should've been 4 nil, but imagine waking up to that pay check in the morning. No cares whatever
All 25 squad players sold.Managers contract terminated. Next week Anfield it could be 10-0.
how did that 4th goal not stand? what did you want him to do? he was off balance.
Your man has got to go!
Ball never hit his arm.
It's crazy that the entire team is built to accommodate Mctominay who is pretty useless outside of his second striker type runs into the box. Solanke deserves an England call up
Where’s the Luke Shaw interview saying how sorry he is and how theyll fight back or should we wait till after Anfield next week 😂
RIP United
Chatted to a friend who knows a lot about football management. Lots of experience of managing teams and he said listen to ETH talk and actually tactically he knows little about the game. Woeful situation at Utd.
So just to clarify we are not even halfway through season & onana has let in 30+ goals could be more
Thank you EtH. Time to depart. Ciao Bella
Onana is the worst keeper Man United has ever seen
It’s crazy how bad Man United are
Would love to hear united fans blaming Onana. I always said he won’t be doing silly mistakes if united had a very good defence. Some goalkeeper touch the ball 3-9 times in a game when they’ve got a very good midfield and defence. Also rashford and Bruno should be benched quiet often so they can put in a bit of work
Unlucky bournemouth, could have been 6-0. Honestly dont know why the 4th was disallowed,  nothing wrong there
A minor setback.
😂😂😂CR7😂😂😂
Top clubs that dominated premier are paving the way for the new success-hungry clubs… Next year’s champions league will see all new English clubs lining up..
The headline is misleading. I was not stunned by this result. I was however stunned that Bournemouth didn't score more.
😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
Class 🎉
Bournemouth disallowed goal handball? Did not look like it tbh
Poorly poorly Man Utd!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!
That 4th goal being ruled out is what is wrong with football
mcguire has to go ASAP
Very well done, Bournemouth,  Am not a man utd fan...but the whole team should be up for sale..Man utd were very lucky it only stayed at 3.0...
Some of these Man Utd players are in the England squad.  Yikes comes to mind for the Euros..
Onana is crap
Fair enough it’s a handball & ruled out as a 4th goal…but surely the keeper has followed through & fouled him there? It’s gotta be brought back for a pen in my book.
Missed a trick not saying “that’s the cherry on top” at the end icl
Made up for Solanke and Bournemouth good stuff
Maybe they should get a better manager and some better players 🤔
This was like Real Madrid beating Stoke   Man U were *awful*
Last goal shouldn’t have been disallowed
Sweet
Lucky for Man-Utd, didn't lost 0-5.
Draw against Villa proved they are no pushover. With a better start and this form Cherries would be Europe bound. Very unfair to take the fourth away.
As United Fan i can say only: o my God. Whit Bournemouth???? 0-3 in lovely Old Trafford????O my word. Greetings from Leicester. Godbless. Unbelievable absolutely tragic and unbelievable unbelievable. Wishing all UNITED FANS A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR 2024. I wish 🤞 will be like before lovely MU champion. Like in 2012/2013. I wish 🤞 😪 😢 😫 my God. Godbless. Glory Glory Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson forever ❤️.
A lot of the united players need selling. Clearly don't care to play for the badge.
Iraola Iraloa He drinks estrella He eats paella He hates the scummers
Bournemouth deserved it against a crap and inconsistent Utd side and honestly they should've had that 4th goal but annoying as a Utd fan knowing I think we could have gone up to 5th if we'd won congrats to Bournmouth they deserved and probably the most normal result from this weekend so far if I'm honest
Should have been 5 😅
That disallowed goal was not a handball. Doesnt change the fact thry won but would of donr the boys some good having the 4-0
It could have been five in fairness. I am a gooner and when we beat bournemouth 3-2 at the emirates last season we were 2-0 down at one point. These same 3 players gave us hell for the full 90 mins. These lads can play.
Definitely 4-0 On the 1st goal, Utd's no. 4 didn't track back quick enough. Where is the effort? The slide to block the cross? If I was manager, I'd be giving him a brow beating
i cant believe the 4th was disallowed fgs
I feel sorry for the disabled fans, can’t leave any quicker
Comes to something when the highlight for utd was having the 4th chalked off 😂
Yaaaay
The gift that keeps on giving 😂YNWA
I thought Bournemouth were gonna be relegated at the start of the season but they have been playing alot better recently,I think they will stay up Tottenham🤝Bournemouth
I come with popcorn
dog brett cooper will be mad.
bit of a joke disallowing the last goal to a handball
I'm not singeling anyone out but Harry Maguire do us all a big favour and walk away from the club .
Solanke is so underrated
Come back de gea😢
MAN U Players are only Bank Balance Footballers. They have taken over the Club along time ago. Only interested in getting their NAILS Done. What a Great Club, ONE TIME Sunday Enjoy
🤣 How many more defeats before Ten Bob gets the push?
How was that handball even called, seriously?
why this manager doesn't play varane is beyond me.
Lenny henry in goal is truly shite
Coffee time at the midden❤❤😂😂
This is atrocious onana can't be blamed alone the defence is shite and I can't stress it enough been saying this from before he came, the man united back four do not do their job and protect the goal keeper he ain't god.
When you don't support one of the so called big teams Results like this make it all worthwhile A game to tell the kids about.
Players should be embarrassed. Really bad result is this
Maguire positioning on the first goal wow he makes sure the guy is free in the box  once he realises he is….. he accompanies him to score  How he plays for united and England mastery of life
Hahaha etc
@0:51 that ball hit Mauire and not the other way round🤣🤣
Why spoiler thumbnails!! Why!!?
I am sick of this new handball rule, the 4th goal for Bournemouth should stand, its not a foul in any way whatsoever! Go back to the deliberate hand ball rule!
Some of the worst fans in the country, look how empty the stadium is towards the end…
United lucky to escape the result at just 3 nil,How Manchester Utd are that high up the table is puzzling another shocking performance.
Harry Maguire looool
😬😱
It's normal now for man utd to lose at home
Man u lucky to get nil.
Onana should be a policeman
Onananaaaaa onnnaanaaa!!
❤ this Utd bet there cockney fans do too 😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 chain 👇
The keep is so poor
It could have easily been 4-0 / 5-0 to Bournemouth.  Man Utd are absolutely AWFUL this season!
That UTD defence and goalie is a prime pub team quality.
Onana is league 2 level
Very easy win for Bournemouth... should have scored 5 or 6 really.
It really could have been 5, quite easily.
I've been saying this for over a year - ETH is a very very bad football manager. He plays Dutch football in a bigger league. It will never work.
The defense is shocking. Defensive midfield is non-existent
It's a long way back to London when you've lost.
I’ve never seen Bournemouth smash someone so easily 😂
Ten Hag has tried but is clearly not getting the best out of the squad. Time for a change. Yet again.
the last goal should have stood as he couldn’t have done anything with the goalkeeper tripping him up
It's my impression or if you shoot against the goalkeeper united is always a goal, if you put on the other side he will pick up 😂 just saying
hand ball rule nowadays is boolox
Everything is disallowed these days, pathetic.
Credits to Bournmouth
I can't wait for Liverpool vs United next week, comment your score prediction😊
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Maguire cant be everywhere. If he was on backpost he wins the aerial challenge. Hes the one shouting and asking for more from players....the way fans went after him was shameful...
Remember when we used to dread going to OT? If you’re as old as me 😏
😂🤣
If Bournemouth can beat united 3 0 at old trafford what will bayern do...
Bournemouth amazing they destroyed Manchester United at Old Trafford.
Ten Hag at the wheel 😂😂😂 Pep and Klopp making a generation of United fans jump ship
Player of the month they said 😭😭
Onana masterclass as usual
So, Solanke thinks that by beating United 3-0 at Old Toilet, they could beat anyone anywhere...sorry, that's bullsh*t. Beating United at Old Toilet means nothing these days, it's happening all the time.
There’s your player and manager of the month United fans! 😂
VAR is nonsense that 4th goal should of not been disallowed
How was that 4th goal disallowed? Was that to save further embarrassment 😅
In the 90s we wuz gud😅
Hand ball and var = Bullshit !
Was the 4th goal ballhand or handball? Either way 😂
The worst thing about it is the commentator. He's awful. 🤦
maguire had the best chance.....lol......
Wow just pure disappointment to see a man united team out there with just a CB pretty much.. rest were non existent.. wages should be given away because they don't deserve 20p for that display the united players other than Harry maguire..  Generally think it's time that if a club gets embarrassed by a lower team then wages shouldn't be paid that week they deserve nothing if they gonna do nothing
Right genuinely.. Manchester United are utterly awful. From top to bottom, completely neutral fan here.. loved watching United growing up.   But it really is no secret the entire club needs to press the reset button 😂😂😂😂
no Man utd side highlight?
Seven Haag is useless.
Manchester Disjointed.
😂
Horrific defending.
Bring back mason. We need goal scorers
United still on dial up while everyone else is on full speed fibre
Oh wow !! What a season we're having
Where is the Gary Neville Podcast!
Man Utd don't do draws. Its all or nothing.. literally
Maguire
ten hag won manager of the month btw
How can you spend that much money and be soooooo bad??
Bournemouth are cooking
But full credit for Bournemouth
They beat city last season and cant even beat cherris
When Maguire is rated their best player , you know they are total garbage.
What a performance from Bournemouth. People who grew up in the 90s and 00s would have found it impossible to imagine Man United could ever be this bad
It's must be amazing to be a utd fan nowadays 😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love the crowd still cheering the *4th* goal being disallowed😂
Ten Hag has a plan…
Onana is one of the worst goalkeepers I’ve ever seen
It’s not rocket science the players are just not good enough so get your bets on now for Liverpool to put 7 past them again.
Well after 21 years my season ticket will not be renewed,  disgraceful and upsetting to watch , all fergie's hard work gone in two seasons, take there mansions, Rolex watches and bentleys off them .......have look at liverpool you may learn something.....yes it's a team game
A rock solid performance from premier league player of the month 😂
The amount of football basics missing is the real concern...no anticipation of danger, no scanning to make quick sensible passes and lack of bravery shown by players not getting into good positions to receive the ball  Def need a rethink on the playing strategy with the players at disposal. Mentally and technically not good enough
Such a bs handball... Still, great win for the cherries. Awful performance from united. Manager of the month BTW! Lmao
Ten hag manager of the month take a bow.
Why does the media still report a United loss like it's a shock?
Lol
Too be fair to United , if it didn't rain they wouldn't have lost the match.
It’s not even a surprise result anymore. If a team turns up to Old Trafford, is organised and willing to work hard, they get 3 points.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂
Banter fc
The refs are shocking lol I swear they are Getting worse
Ronaldo is a prophet he said Ten is not a good manager
Bournemouth werre good but United were awful 😂
As a West Ham fan, I can honestly say I’m excited about this Man Utd project 😂😂😂
ridiculous to rule out last goal
Now it’s December Harry Maguire has gone back to normal
Can't believe Man Utd are still 6th
Handball? You can't see nit......
As a man utd fan the last goal should be disallowed
Erm it's Bournemouth.... Sack haag now.. Not the man for the job never will be and never was... Managing in a tin pot league in Holland..
MAGUIRE YET AGAIN!!!
As. Liverpool fan I miss when man United we’re good
I've never really felt sorry for United fans.. but watching them play with Maguire in that spot is really hard to watch.
Iraola was written off so early be pundits that didn't know a thing about what he did at Rayo. Good to see people being proven wrong.
Good of Man Utd to settle for 3-0😅
Utd are helpless
1. Well don Dom 2. Why can’t Utd players see eachother? 3. Is casimero still alive? 4. Why does Harry think he’s a striker? 5. Are Utd players under instruction not to attack through balls/crosses?
Plastic fans leaving early 😅
Ahh Bournemouth the gift that just keeps on giving
Why didn't they show the Man United attacks? One sided highlights to favour Bournemouth.
the best player in PL 🤣🤣🤣
If Bournemouth scored 3. I can't wait till next weekend 7-0 😂
...........and to think you were all messing a sock with Garnacho's goal of the season and Maguire's world class performance revival...........
I can't wait for Man Utd vs Bayern Munich game, it should be fun.
Don't think United fans feel entitled anymore. Too many years of reality like the rest of us. Long may it continue! Props to Bournemouth for a wonderful run of late.
The guy who scored the third goal was Senesi. Just letting you know as the commentators don’t seem to know him
Why is maguire a thing again? A few good games and hes back in, ridiculous
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
It's funny how all you utd fans moan a groan about a guy treat him almost as scum like he's not fit to wear the shirt yet he's your best player buy miles this season
Hahaha!!! Love it 😊
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Imagine what Liverpool are going to do to them next at Anfield. Probably 10-0 this time
Can’t wait for Rochdale vs Man Utd, coming to a Sunday morning review show soon 😂😂😂
Haaaaaaaa manushited😂
Why did United fans cheer when the 4th goal got disallowed?😂 you’ve just been thumped stay quiet young boys
You know you're bad when united biggest cheer comes from Bournemouths disallowed 4th goal 😂
Another awful var decision for Bournemouth's 4th.
All is well in the world now that man united have been beaten again abnormal things happen when they win like Man City dropping points to Villa
Love it!
This is the same club who's player received POTM lol😂😂😂
In what world is that fourth disallowed?
Absolute garbage from United,,next four games they will not win,,championship next season.
Absolutely torn apart, something seriously wrong if you have play Luke shaw as CB when Varane is on the bench.
I’m watching this on the loop all day…… Bruno gets a yellow to avoid going to Anfield…😅😂😂😂
As a United fan but more importantly a football fan that fourth should have stood , the games gone made , his arm was by his side
Normal business has resumed.
Notice everytime united lose the likes are amazing😂😂😂😂 i help too haha
Bournemouth looked to be in full control and happy to fight all game long.  Great to see Solanke getting the goals and being the player we were told he could be.
wow that was awful ........unless you are a city fan
Why pay 100m for Kane, when you can spend 70m on Hojlund.
In defence they are giving too much space
We beat Chelsea 2-1 at home but then lose 3-0 at home to Bournemouth what a complete joke these players are so hot and cold we need a complete clear out in January they are so comfortable doing this week in week out with their high end pay checks it’s not fair on the fans and  the honour and glory of what this club represents historically
I quite enjoyed watching those Wild Cherries play that funky football! I know a song about that!
How has Man Utd been stunned? They are rubbish it’s no surprise to anyone
Feel bad for Harry Maguire
Watford looked great out there
Bournemouth leveld up
😅
Haahhahahahahahahah
No matter what manager or superstar player they bring in. Man u will never be the same since Fergie
Instead of slating man u, Let's praise Bournemouth.
Master class from utd
When Harry Mcguire is the only player with a shot on target you know it's a bad day for man u
I wish we lived in the days of yore so bards could write songs about Harry Maguire
Come and watch Salford
Man Utd made a deal with UEFA to add a 5th champions league spot
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
These players have no bottle there's no excuse to go down 3-0 at home
Beat Chelsea wow
Did united have a goalkeeper 😂😂 what a rubbish team 😅
Var at it again. We all wanted that 4th goal. Party poopers. 😂😂😂
Goal disallowed,Hit the post once and they scored 3 can it get any worse?!
And to think ten hag has just got manager of the month and maguire player of the month 😂
Makes us look even worse 🤣
"inform man united"
Balti YANITED in the mud AGAIN 😂😂🤣🤣😂😭🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There are absolutely no small clubs in the Premier League. Everybody can beat everybody. Do not underestimate the unsuccessful clubs!
How is Harry Maguire a England player is totally disrespectful to the nation.
Man Utd are a mid table team nowadays. People need to realise it’s 2023 now, not 2003.
Ten haag 😂😂 he said they were back😅😅😅🇬🇧🇮🇱
PL award hat-trick, classic Man Utd complacency…
Arsenal fans recognise this Bournemouth performance from the classic emirates come back last season 👏👏
Headline says "stun" but honestly I expected them to get beat 😂😂
best present for Christmas ever
More like Man U stun Bournemouth by Bournemouth only scoring 3
Love the look on Harry’s face when he knew he did not marked his man and Bournemouth score their 3rd
Maguire out
Man United are back 😆
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chelsea literally gave yous a life line in the league and this is how utd responded 😅
The only stunning thing about the result is that it was only 3 they scored, could've, should've been more
Every other team cant wait to  play in the theatre of mares
Thank god the 4th goal was disallowed. it could have been embarrassing.
As usual, Maguire was involved in all 3 Bournemouth goals........... Maguire will be the reason Ten Hag will be sacked
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Max Branning doing a awesome job at Manchester United
Soon as i put a bet on utd they go and do this
Man u had 20 shots on goal and 70% possession and lost 3-0, only they can produce such stats atm.
Phillip's goal was top billing.
United are back !
normal service is resumed
They playing Liverpool next 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 9-0
That 4th goal should have counted aswell
They play without the pace you see with other teams in the PL for some reasons. Even bottom placed teams in PL are not slow in moving the ball and can’t string reasonable patterns of play. It’s now hard to tell whether it’s the coaching or attitude of the players. Yesterday Arsenal lost but the play and identity of the team was there, even Aston Villa now has a style of play. We still cry out to know what exactly this team does very well
I've heard on the graph line that they lining up risi sunak to take over with Boris as assistantsanager
Hhh😂
Should have been about 7
onana has actually played really well but the defense of man u is a shambles, maguire still gets the england call up tho
When Manu will realise,  this coach is an avarage one
Ohh,but,but..but we play in Champions League,we beat Chelsea,but,wait ..Ten Hag era is here😂😂😂😂😂😂
DECEMBER 2023 Oh dear, what happened Lost to Newcastle, won against Chelsea and lost to Bournemouth? Is our Red Devils team for real. They can't even get a run of wins these days. The WORST Man Utd team ever. 🇬🇧Ⓜ️🇬🇧😠😠😠😠😠😠
Bournemouth have not been awarded a penalty since the season before last, so if Outarra had gone down instead of trying to stay on his feet for that disallowed goal, I somehow doubt it would've been a penalty.... although it should have been! Very harsh decision to disallow it, but no surprise to us Cherry fans.
Man utd only lost 3-0. Well done 👍
United fans  'Maguire is playing class...'
Should have been 4. Very unlucky to have the fourth ruled out, VAR strikes again. Anyway Bayern in the CL then Liverpool away up next for United, good luck. lol
The 1st goal, the Man Utd number 23 should be blocking it with his leg out for corner. Pallister, Bruce, Rio etc stop that cross from reaching Bournemouth striker!
Who hates Man United hit likes
Man united the gift that keeps on giving
united are crap
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We were awful, we should have lost 4-0, Cherries robbed by VAR
It’s gonna be a good night out in city centre
Even if Sancho bothered to return he wouldn’t have done nothing and on 350k A WEEK!
Excellent Win for the cherries
Bournemouth stun Terrible Man Utd with a brilliant 3-0 away W,game highlights.
I'm a Chelsea fan and this is what I like to see.
We are soo poor at the back and the keeper it's painful  I can't believe golden glove winner too leave, makes no sense.
How is this the same team that played Chelsea of the park on Wednesday!!?   Madness.
Come on, Erik needs time to stamp his mark on the team
Only 3 then 😂
That hand ball disallowed goal was extremely harsh imo
what a time to be a bournemouth fan 🤭
United goalie is useless..
Bournemouth are an elite European team. It's not a surprise that they beat ManU. I expect them to win the domestic double this season.
Just wanted to say: Hahahaha
Feels like the players want ten haag out watching that
Ahh yes the theatre of memes
Burst my coupon this result but you know what it's worth it.
Thanks to Utd for providing the Christmas pantomime laughs this year. Keep up the good work.😂
I know Man United as a team were poor, but Maguire at the end there😅
Hahaha manc united flop again shambles of a team I love it love seeing this scum of a team lose 👌🏽
How it feels to be a utd fan: lose = must win, win = must lose 😂🙃
that was 4-0 that was. pathetic UTV
The players Ten hag has brought to United should get him the sack.   All the best talent has come from the academy l and bar Martinez every other signing has been crap. Also I would’ve kept Sabizter  over Arambat, at least Sabizter was a decent goal threat
The handball rule is a joke it should have been 4-0
The craziness of Bournemouth disallowed 4th goal is that the player was fouled by the goalie and that's why he stumbled and the ball hit his arm, if it was disallowed for handball then a penalty should have been awarded for the goalies foul!!!
United are in the bin
that handball shout to make it 4-0 is absolute bs and i’m a united fan
Onana has to be the worst goalkeeper the prem has seen honestly be better playing outfield
De Gea must be loving it 😂
If ten Haag has any sense he’d just resign de gea, not like it can get any worse😂
That was 4 should've been more
Ladies and gentlemen, your PL Player and Manager of the month.
I thought us Newcastle United losing to Bournemouth was a low but that was away...this is worst for Manchester United because they got beaten at home....back to default settings then for the red devils
If thats not a 4th goal, then it should have been a pen.
Even as a united fan, that 4th goal should have never ever been disallowed. Shocking refereeing as usual
Ten hag got barclays manager of the month   Maguire received barclays player of the month   Put the real icing on the cake and make Onana  Barclays keeper of the month
When you think your team has problems there's always man utd to cheer you up lmao .......... brilliant
Onana needs to leave us in peace i stg
Ohnana went from being a top class keeper at Milan to being league one material at utd😂 utd kills good players in modern days
What a stunning match from Bournemouth well done!
Erik ten give him a hug
2:35 that goal should off counter
Should off been 4.0
maguire must be the virus !
He didn't quite nail that cherry on top / icing on the cake pun
Onana 😆 what a shite keeper
0-3 and Old Trafford a match made in heaven
Yo, fair play to Bournemouth! Winning by 3 at Old Trafford always takes skill, no matter how badly the opposition play!
Its not easy to beat Bournemouth 😂
Is that player of the month Maguire?😂😂
Solanke is such a solid pl striker anytime I see Bournemouth play he usually scores
Man U were lucky to get 0
Ridiculous goal disallowed 😂
Can't to see Liverpool score 7 goals against Manchester United
United put in their best performance of the season coinciding with Chelsea's absolute worst,  normal service now resumes,  Ten Hag's actually lost 11 games in 22 this season,  that's INSANE.
United are absolutely dreadful, half of their wins this season they have scraped and got away with it. ETH is such a fraud how United fans think he’s good I don’t know. Don’t even know what his play style is or what tactic he has 😂😂😂😂
The mighty Bournemouth conquer United at Old Trashyard. Ten Hag in!!
Didn't Man utd win the league last week when Garnacho did an overhead kick? I swear everyone was talking about it that much
One of two things will happen for Bournemouth at the end of the season: 1) They sell Solanke for a record-smashing fee and are able to seriously bid to  upgrade their key positions. 2) They keep Solanke and remain the no.1 banana skin team for every other team in the league.
The icing on the cherries cake lmao
1st goal: Maguire four yards away from his mark in the box and then gets nutmegged  Chance at 1:15: Maguire playing Solanke onside because his lack of pace means he's too scared to push up high. Instead he feels he needs to drop off and give himself a few yards, but this just means it's so easy for Solanke to get through on goal. Luckily he hits the post   2nd goal: Yes Shaw gets beaten for the header from the mark behind him, but he's in between strikers because Maguire is just standing there 4 yards away from his mark, marking no one. Causes indecision in Shaw which gives the striker too much space to win the ball  3rd goal: Poor defending all round, but how can he allow a header in the 6 yard box when his entire skill set is based on defending those scenarios  Disallowed 4th goal: Loses the ball inextricably trying to dribble in a really bad spot under pressure. Very lucky that was disallowed  Honestly he's a Championship level defender, and whenever you gets a run in the team United seem to concede a ton of goals. Remember at the end of Solskjaer's reign, the beginning of Ten Hag's reign they conceded a ton! Then he has a long gap out of the first team and United looked a bit more solid and picked up a lot of clean sheets last year. Now he's back in and it's back to thumpings against average teams. Get him out of the XI!
At some stage they will realise maguire is not good enough for the Premier league. No organisation at the back for set pieces. All over paid players that want a wage and don't care about club. Coming from a Liverpool supporter. United should be winning these games easy
No brain cells or soul left since Harry maguire keeps pulling off the biggest heist
You can clearly see the Glazer’s being directly responsible for that 1st goal
I don’t understand how we can go from the performance the other day against Chelsea beating them 2-1 to this. There is something wrong and it’s not understandable. Just when you seem to think that we are a good team and on our day wen we try we’re a threat to any team but performances like this make you question what is going on
How the hell did that last goal not stand? Ridiculous
The 4th goal should have stood, OR VAR should have looked at it being a possible penalty courtesy   of the United goaly. AND NOT disallowed for handball. Maguire was Man United's best player. (AND SADLY He's past it in the Premier league.)  He'd be a good asset at a lower league. It's a pity the other defenders were living it up on a holiday camp.  The forwards show no commitment, skill, or anything else.   Apart from the moans about Man United it was a fantastic result and achievement for the Bournemouth team and their fans.  YOU should be in the top 8 and NOT Man Utd. ONLY  the refereeing decisions and VAR have kept Man Utd up there  in the last ten seasons.
Maguire he is  Sleeping..!!😂😂
it’s funny because you can hand ball it, pass the ball off instead of shooting and the goal would’ve been allowed
Liverpool fans were here.
Much appreciated, Bournemouth.
Bloody hell... It was 4-0 var was on cocoain I think...
What makes this more funny is that somehow Ten Hag & Maguire won the manager/player of the month awards a few days ago 😂
Man United doesn't like defending  set pieces 😂
Should be 0:6 bit 0:3 will do 😂😂
Man Utd get beaten every where we go... o wait. We were at home 🥶   Does this count for a domestic violence case?
Didn't realise Watford are in the premier league
Glad to see Man Utd back to their normal selves
Think we have another medi abalimba here. Seen better goalkeeping in Sunday league
What was it ETH said when he first come eras come to an end referring to klopp and pep i think hes right about one era his own at man united 😂😂
So disappointed we lost
Man U are gonna lose 7-0 to Liverpool again aren’t they?
I like how united cheer when the 4th goal is disallowed when they’re literally losing 3-0
NEVER again will i put this awful team in my weekend accy!!
So we beat Chealse and then lose
Just keep doing what you’re doing Eric .. for as long as possible.
Back to their best.
Lovely.
United are just an embarrassment and thoroughly deserve to get beaten by the majority of teams. Our new black Bartez is like a rabbit in headlights, dazzled and confused and the rest are no better. I dont know why i expect better from this rabble...
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahagahahahahahahahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahagahahahahahahahahaha
Didn't stun anyone united ain't a big club anymore lol
Normal service has resumed
Maguire back to his best I see. Should just retire . Totally to blame for all 3 goals
Seeing United lose makes my day
I'm a united fan but the 4th goal definitely should have stood
That fourth goal is not handball and even if it was it's a nonexistent touch meaning if you watch the slow mo the fact his hand is there doesnt even change the direction the ball is traveling.  Sky sports keeping ten haag employed again to sell news stories
United fans blaming Haag saying he needs to leave, sorry but he wasn't on the pitch lads 😂😂😂 your team played dreadfully
You love to see United CRUMBLE 😂😂😂
Ten hag doesn't have a clue what he's doing, those 💩 tactics may have worked in the Dutch league but not over here
Forest fan here. How is Bournemouth's fourth goal disallowed. Ridiculous VAR decision.
The problem is De Gea and Ronaldo 🤣🤣🤣 Should be 0-4
Man Utd fan here. I've seen highs and lows with this club over the years however, this is one of the strangest seasons i can remember. Every time we get a good result we think "finally things are changing" and then the very next game it's back to the same old rubbish. How we are as close to the top four as we are after such a poor start to the season i do not know.
I remember when the big four would win almost every weekend. This is much better.
Show some respect to Arsene Wenger, at least he consistently made Arsenal finish in top 4
The only team in the top 10 with minus goal difference.
I blame Maguire because , when Man U loses we all blame him regardless of his faults or not
This is absolutely hilarious 😂😂😂
Man U never been the same since Alex left
3 nil flattered Utd.
How can they conclusively say that hit his hand? If you can’t be 100% sure how can VAR give it? How is that clear? And how is it obvious? A joke.
Harry Maguire potm aged like fine milk…
Can we stop with the "crisis averted" and "Manchester United are back" nonsense every other week?
Maguire winning Player of the Month is the biggest con I have ever witnessed.
I was shocked to see the thumbnail but holy cow!!!!!! That’s why you never underestimate any club. Bournemouth clearly wanted it more. Well done you Cherries 🍒 full respect to you 🫡
Should have been 4. Clearly not handball
Onana banana he can't save any shoots 😡
Ten Bob Theo
Manchestdidium Unitedus is in fact Latin for Pooey Pants.
They've had there day, 30 years of misery now!!!
4-0 really
most expensive pub team of all time is an achievement
The Man U goalkeeper the worst ever compared to some the previous very good keepers that Man U have had
Glazers don’t actually check the results each week, they just check the 📈📉
Disgusting, ten hag out
Horrendus from united
No surprise.  That’s United with the carelessness.
Should be 4-0 VAR Is a joke
Now this is the United we all know 😂
Onana & Maguire deserve to play at a better club.
Onana is fit for the bin cut your losses and play the reserve keeper what an embarrassment- Man U fan
Onana is greatest goalkeeper the world has ever seen…😅
Utterly beautiful haha 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think untied will win the league this season😊
Crazy how nobody can beat the relegation candidates when they all need each other to drop points
Manager of the month. Player of the month. Goal of the month.  It all went to their heads and they're back to normal.
Should of been 4 or 5 goals
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Maguire, McTomonay..just a lolzone.
That disallowed goal at the end should have stood. They only disallowed it to save them from a complete embarrassment instead of an embarrassment 😂
Glad man United are shocking
😂😂😂 oh it’s so good too see the Mancs getting a good scudding at home
Absolutely shocking defending by United. Feel for Onana having that shite in front of him.
Man u are pony....
😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love it
Another great maguire game
How can that be a handball at the end? Should have been 0-4
😂😂😂😂😂
Yet to watch a United game where they actually play well this season
STUN? the only people Cherries stunned are themselves, everyone associated United knows what they get with this bunch of players.
Beautiful. Long way back to London for the travelling home fans.
sack the goal keeper and the manager both are crap!!!
4th rightfully handball but why wasnt it a pen because before the handball onana got none of the ball
Maguire is comedy gold
lol Onana is shocking 🤣
How funny 😁 cmon you mighty Liverpool you'll never walk alone 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩✊️ watching Manchester United like this is so so good 👍
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
The theatre of dreams now the theatre of nightmares.
Brilliant performance by Man utd.
If the 4th goal was disallowed, then it should have been a penalty
Manger of the Month & Player of the Month. Shows you how much of a pisstake those two accolades can be.
Ten Hag IN
To think the likes of Mr inconsistent Rashford is earning 300k is an absolute joke and embarrassment. These players don’t know what it means and what it takes the best a Man Utd player. No heart, will or passion for any one of them.
Please drop Onana and start bayindr
No disrespect to Bournemouth but Man Utd shouldn't lose at home to teams like these.
If you ever want to go to a circus. Just watch Utd play every weekend 😂😂
Onana , worst gk in united history
Absolute masterclass from the cherries👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I see Bruno chickened out of the match at Anfield next week 😂
Disgusting! Not one United fan is shocked by this result, great performance on Wednesday but just a one off as always
And a partridge in a pear tree
😂
Marcus Rashford haters where you at? 😂
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
De gea is the person you didn’t realise you needed until they’re gone
This is football heritage
Slackest defending I've seen since every Spuds game. Makes our loss to Villa bearable.
Is it even a shock now? Im certainly not stunned
Just came here to say it's all cr7 fault 😂😂😂😂
Question...How many dutch managers have been a success in the Premier League? errrr, none. Fernandes comes out says we need to do better next time.......no sh*t Sherlock, but that record is wearing thin. Oh, let's not mention EtH starting Martial, WHY? Then buying Onana and Antony, put that money together and we could have a happy Harry Kane, Lord have mercy because the supporters have none any more.
They lose 3-0 and the ref still gives a crooked decision utds way to save complete embarrassment… joke of a club so rotten and corrupt I love seeing these lot lose
Give Seven Hag a chance.........15-20 years perhaps? 🤣🤣🤣
Classic newskool utd more holes than a teabag ....
Watch Harry in two of those goals ! Absolutely awful and only saved by VAR for the cherry on the top clanger ! Player of the month lmao
😂😂😂
Might as well replace Man utd in the champions league with Aston villa
Here we go again total crap the worst manager and team ever. There's not one player of any quality sack the lot. Well played Bournemouth.
Onana flying like a wingless pigeon lol
Imagine getting absolutely beaten by a fighting relegation side by 3 goals to nile lmaoa at home LMAOAO💀💀💀😄😄😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
4th should have been allowed.
Gary Neville “ it’s the owners fault for spending more money than most other clubs over the past 10 seasons .
As a Chelsea fan, seeing this infuriates me. Are we still really that big of a deal to you United lot in our current situation? You show up and give it your all and look good then get your arses handed to you by Bournemouth? Well done the Cherries I guess. 👏👏
Another fantastic performance from Manure well done the Cherries ha ha ha it looks like a ten hag might have some time on his hands over Xmas
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
maguire masterclass
The 4th should have counted.
I was at it in person it was absolutely shocking by Man Utd was my 1st time in Old Trafford not the game I look back on fondly imo Granacho and Mcguire man Utds best players Imo Anthony Martial starting was a accident waiting to happen didn't make sense to me
man united are back? 😂
Maguire shocking performance as per 😂 a few average performances against relegation teams and he got the sympathy POTM, glad he’s back to his usual standards 😂
Awful handball rule we have in this country, how has that 4th goal been disallowed? Completely unintentional and nothing he could do about it, same as the Havertz one in the Villa Arsenal game, needs changing immediately!
Billing and Solanke look pretty similar which I think makes them all the better
Uo there with one of are worst performances credit to Bournemouth but we was static an all over the place midfield was wide open🤦
Delete this. Now.
Onana wo y3 kwasia paaaaa 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Baldys at the wheel
Pretty sure that last goal should have been allowed, for the same reason as why the Newcastle one should have. It came off his body and he didn't know anything about it.
😂
Look at onana on the second and third goal it's so bad it's funny
Well done to Bournemouth,  for winning at Old Tragic.
Great watch, match of the day!  Terrible conditions I hope all those fans have a safe journey back home to the south coast……..and also the Bournemouth fans to!
What an utter joke but to be expected.
Loving it. Where was McQuire with that last goal.
That fourth never should’ve been disallowed. United can count themselves lucky 😅
38 Years old and this is the worst goalkeeper I have ever seen in a United shirt.. and i'm including John O'Shea..
Sell the club sack everyone and call it Man new nited 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 banter fc in the mud u gotta love it worst team ive ever seen
Good ol Slab head Harry. POTM loooooool I say Looooooooool
Result of the season so far!! YNWA!! Love it!!
Why cant man u defend ?
And Southgate will still have Maguire as his number one in the centre of England's defence next year......😢
Never forget, United fans turned on a football legend CR7 for this bald fraud 😂😂💪
Manager of the month))
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!
Ten Hag is at the wheel 🤦🏽‍♂️   Get this low level Dutch league manager out of this club
stop the excuses . onana is crap . 21 goals conceded in 16 games . not good . the second goal was a joke .
When are Man United fans going to accept they're not even a Europa League side anymore?
Ouattara goal should have stood. Should have been 0-4.
So so so funny
To beat midtable opposition isnt easy. Fair play to Bournemouth
Stun? Man U could lose to a side in the championship and it wouldn't be surprising at this point
Jeez, it could have been 4 or 5
They get a win against the worst Chelsea team this season and really think theyre back😂😂 welcome to reality
And De Gea is still a free agent
Well done Bournemouth
Ok looking forward to watching these highlights of the Team Of The Month, Manager Of The Month, Goal Of The Month Scorer and Zinadine McTominay xd
luke shaw is lazy
As a Utd fan I missed this game I felt so stupid so I checked score line and after checking I was glad I never watched this match 😊
Absolutely loving it 😂
"THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK "?BY PROF WALTER VEITH POWERFUL POWERFUL WATCH TRUTH ALWAYS WINS ❤
The way they played is just like they are not in the mood and some are no way putting in more effort  anyway it is what it is it was not united days karma is on its way for united
🤣🤣🤣
One of these teams was just awarded player and manager of the month
Congrats to the Player of the month, the manager of the month and to the goal of the month. Truly we are stunned.
Man Utd are finished !
Maguire living up to his POTM award
Just sack him he is well Out of his depth
United providing unlimited entertainment for all fans in the epl.
Next sunday....liverpool away. Ooossshhhhj
Really impressive to watch Solanke develop into the player all the managers and scouts said he was
"now we look like a team" says Bruno. This is what happens when you disrespect the *goat*
Remember just 3 days ago they were back, not in a crisis, and in contention for UCL after they beat a shite Chelsea team 😂 when will they learn?
Tavernier looks class
I always love it when the underdogs win at Old Trafford but I guess it just wasn’t meant to be today
The problem is the fans and the ex-players with so much entitlement to think they should be winning things year in and year out. yes, you did it for 20 years, but that does not give you the entitlement to win things forever.
Dam and blast 🙄
😂these player just stop trying for managers
Hi fellow Liverpool fans 😜
I don’t even know what to say 🤦🏻‍♂️  Put rashford up front not as a winger leave garnacho in he’s place get rid of Antony and get a new right winger
Brilliant result for Bournemouth
united defence  looks so ordinary and half asleep
this new united keeper is shitter than de gea
Conclusive proof that football is better without VAR. Joke decision for the 4th goal. As I have always thought, the people who run football know all about football politics, and nothing about the actual sport.
Trust the process, top 3 and a cup trophy easy for united. Still have the quality.
As a Liverpool fan I am super happy😅😂
😱
Bournemouth players  be  playing like,, we do not want to return to the championship, we like it here very much in the premier league,  thank you very much,,  3 bags full sir.. and who can blame them,, playing in the premier league is what dreams are made off.. and the pay is ten times better,,  Facts.. great result for them,, not so good for man utd,,  but thats football.
Should of been 4 never a handball
Get ole back at the wheel
How could old Trafford's leaky roof do this?
Man United are so washed XDD
As an Arsenal fan, this is a lovely silver lining after the Villa loss. I'd rather see United get embarrased than anything. Also, first time I've seen that Bournemouth kit, rather slick.
Handball rule is a joke now.
2:45 Never talk about empty seats again.
How is Harry maquire a pro footballer, seen players in the 8th tier better than Him guys a joke
Breaking news liverpool scored 8 goals at Anfield
Liverpool fans loving this 😂
Get those Norwich scarves out Mancs. Has a manager ever been sacked while being manager of the month? Maguire player of the month too! Unbelievable bias that.
I’m sorry but Man U goal Keeper is the worse I’ve seen🤣he’s a joke and they nagged de gea??? Lol they all miss him now
I always want the underdogs to win but unfortunately today Bournemouth won.Why were so many utd fans dressed as red seats?
Who is the chubby one that needs a shave?
Everton fan here. Watched the game, Bournemouth were brilliant and should have scored more. United are a truly awful side. Well p.ayed Cherries.
😂😂😂😂😂
The saving grace is, Sir Jim (Glazers)! 🐀 cliffe is coming in to save them. The fact the Glazers are that greedy, they put their own needs before the needs and best interests of an organisation (global brand) is the soul reason, Utd will never compete ever again for trophies. Rule number one! Never let greedy American owners take over a business.
Should of been 6-0
One player with one burst of speed and desire took 5 Man United players out of the game and crossed the ball for the first goal. United are there for the taking in every game. Sacking the manager won’t help, spending hundreds of millions on new players won’t help. Put Haaland and Kevin DB in United kits and they will be transformed in to crap players overnight. Such is the rot at Old Trafford.
I used to pray for times
Ten Hag seems to have forgotten you can't always get away with playing Maguire in defence.
Man Utd are looking noticably vulnerable without Whiteside, Robson and Hughes.
Love it! Ten hag is the new solskjaer!
Onana might actually be the worst keeper in the history of football, how is he this incompetent
DOM SOLANKE, USED TO BE SCOUSE ‼️‼️
Knew Bournemouth would punish united today Bournemouth have looked very well organised the past few games and hungry well done to the cherries for fighting to get up the table🍒
Hojlund is unbelievable 🔥🔥🔥
It’s the season to be jolly  ❤
Hearing the commentator say, "The goal has been disallowed for bournemouth, they will have to settle for 3-0 at old Trafford" is ALARMING. 😅
We will batter these lot next week 😂😂
It's so beautiful seeing Man Utd crumble and their fans crying year after year. Beautiful ❤
Could so easily have been 0-6. Absolutely demolished.
Man UTD making Christmas come early for us all!
Thank god the last goal was disallowed... 0-4 would have been embarrassing.
Jeckle & Hyde United.
Dalot and Luke shaw are terrible
The entire club is buying p45s in bulk
Nothing wrong with that 4th goal it wouldn’t have made a difference where his hand was he would’ve scored
Utd jokers
🤣🤣🤣🤣 man utd are a joke
I thought utd keeper was supposed to be the greatest keeper on earth 😆😆
Should have been 0-6!
That 4th that was denied, if a handball, should have actually been a pen and booking for Onana. He fouled the player causing the handball.  Still funny though.
I mean it’s definitely not completely ten hags fault
Only United can make you hate and love a team at the same time 😂
24 hours is such a long time in football 🤣
Man United fans cheering when the fourth called wasn't given. At least they go home happy now.
The handball rule is absolute bullshit. What is Ouattara meant to do there other than chop his arm off or become intangible for two seconds? Utter shite this sport is turning into.
Should have been 5-0
UTD are absolute joke at the minute. Few wins they've had are down to utter luck. I've said it before UTDs defence is awful, no leadership no one's talking at the back, very lazy performance from overpaid pub-football team. The goalkeeper needs to take control of his defence, WAKE UP
Maguire 😅😅😅
Could have been 5-0….😮😢😂
Ten haag sacked next week for sure. Get better performances managerless I think.
you cant blame the manager all the time, there are so many smug footballers around they think they have a divine right to be god just because there on these million wages, and if they dont get there own way there cry wolf and mutiny in the dressing room,
Matter of time, Man Uniteds recent form has been overexaggerated by 1-0 wins
Thanks United! I had Onana in goal thinking he might claw back a solid performance and clean sheet with united having a point to prove at home!........thus i chose to play my 5 midfielders instead of Solanke who left on my bench😂 boy was I wrong. Fantasy football is stressful
Man U need to completely rebuild their defence. It's not EPL level... that would be a start
Half the Utd fans travelled up from Bournemouth so it wasn't that bad after all...
All becouse of Ronaldo, now ETH hasnt got anyone to blame.
Cherries didn't stun anyone. Fully expected. Conference side can beat Man United
Onana can't even stop a taxi. What a waste of money for Man U.
They have Bobby Charlton spinning in his grave.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Manager of the month showing his quality of loosing to a relegation team
Onana is awful
This is what Man Utd do when they hate their coach and play like this. The whole lot should be fined or sacked for doing this because also it looks like they’re paid off to lose by the bookies
“We are Manchester utd, we do what we want “ A quote from a fan years ago . Disliked Man Utd ever since, your my second team !! I support Who ever is playing you , enjoying the the suffering. And hurt 🤔😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🇺🇦
Just play it on a loop and it just gets better...
Any Liverpool fans watching 😂😅😊
I know the state that Manure are in is entertaining/shocking depending on which side of the fence you’re on but where is the credit for this Bournemouth team who have taken 16 points out of a possible 21 in their last seven EPL games. Outstanding form, I hope it continues and they survive.
When going to old Trafford play to win :sun tzu
Seriously why have they kept onana on!!!!
First goal was shaw not trying? Watch it
So greet seeing arsenal and United lose
Looks like the end for Ten Hag.
😂😂😂😂
Lol
Not even a “STUN” this is expected😂😂😂
United, the gift that keeps on giving 😂
in 2009, bournemouth were 21st in league two, just 9 points off relegation.   now here they are, in 2023, beating manchester united at old trafford for the first time ever, 3-0. what a ways to come.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They battered United, should've been 5-0 but United were lucky
Wrap up warm, minus three in Manchester tonight !
Bournemouth won't get the credit for playing well it will be man utd didn't play well
Not a ManU fan but some of their results this season feel numb - circus city!!
Don’t get the “stun” bit in the title…
We need arab oil money
The fact UTD are 6th is baffling.
stunned that maguire had an attempt on the correct goal
not stunned at all  manu are average at best nowadays
A joke club
Erik's at the wheel
Bring on Bayern Munich.. You aint seen nothing yet!!!
Bournemouth Fans had to travel South with all the Utd fans after the game...
Maguire got a player of the month...
Love watching the manager of the months united side, just brilliant how they let attackers into their box so easily and give away goals! The true charity workers of the premier league! 😌🤣😂
I'm all for backing the manager but when he's leaving the like of Rasmus out who scores goals to play martial it's very difficult to stand by the bloke he keeps making poor poor team choices onana should of already been dropped to the bench
The funny thing is if utd won today they were right up there in the mix top 3
Every week I play: Spot the Onana-Banana!… 😆
😅😅 onana couldn’t catch a cold never mind the ball
..so it should have been 6-0 ..!
Skys love child 😂😂😂😂
I love solanke as a player I think he’s quality and that goal showed it, he was class against Derby the other year and I thought he could carry it on in the tier above and he has
😂, credit to Bournemouth what a performance. Play really good football ⚽️ 👍
Lol
This wasn’t even our worst performance at home lol.
Lisandro martinez and Varane 😭😞 we’re so sorry you had to see this
McTominay is such a liability in midfield, yes he gets goals sometimes but it so easy for opposition attackers to get through. He’d be better used as a substitute, hopefully Casemiro is back soon.
I’d love to see fergies 11 play against this lot…… 🤣🤣
Handball for the 4th goal it was going in regardless lets be honest the hand made no difference 😂
Man u Man u Man u Man u
Classic
Shameful
Don't underestimate Bournemouth this season. They are really good!
ETH broke another record, gifted  Poomouth first ever win at old Trafford 😂😂
lady united
Bruce Grobbelaar in disguise .
Those goals were ruthless. Amazing work when it really counted from the Bournemouth players. (I do have a bit of a soft spot for Bournemouth having been on weekend trips there regularly during my youth)
how is that handball?? the law is bs. He couldn't help touching it!
De Gea has liked all 1.8k comments
I think it is high time to let Keano loose in the Old Trafford dressing room.
amrabat looks an absolute lump 😂
Bwahahahaha
VAR saved Man utd the 4th goal  😂
Too keep your best defender on the bench..., and play a fullback in the cb role is beyond me...
Well deserved Bournemouth on a fantastic result, that was fun to watch. 😂😂
Can you imagine that happening under Ferguson?
Feel sorry for Man U keeper😔
If the Bournemouth, first goal was scored by Man U everyone would calling goal of the month
Things you love to see!!!! 😂
I'm a neutral but I still reckon that's an unacceptable result for MU. Entertaining though...
3 nil flattered manu😅
Almost the icing on the Cherry's cake
As a Man U fan....im guna paddle my canoe to Panama
Utd are a sorry shower really - so much badness in the squad - attitude stinks
It would take a heart of stone not to laugh out loud.
Maguire Bewildered?
Man United becoming as mediocre as Chelsea😅
Last one was a goal 4-0 loss for manure
Hahahahahahhahahahaahahhaahahahahahahahahahahhahaahahahahahaaahaa
Gory gory man united😂
OLD TRAFFORD IS FALLING DOWN! ....  You know the rest 😏
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's always great when the underdogs win and playing at home gives them more of a chance but today wasn't the case.
Remember when they hit Liverpool with the 7up cherry after getting 7-0illed 😂
Give ten bob a ten year extension 😂
Now this has cheered me up.
Dom Solanke is so so underrated. What a player
Just normal result at Old trafford, not shocked by this 0-3 loss.
It's a complete shambles
Man U play well again!
Up the cherries
Can we take that month of the player trophy back from this slabhead 😂😂😂
"Best keeper in the Prem, Better than Alison" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂the
The manager has to go!!
David Moyes's fault
Sky wearing out the word.....'STUNNNN'....
Manager of the month looks out of his depth 😂😂😂
Having Onana in goal is like hailvong an open goal
Lucky to be just 3 😂😂😂
Best pl manager and player of the month 😅😅😅😅
The best teams in Manchester: - City - Stockport - Salford - City Women - Manchester Blind Football Team - FC United of Manchester  Man United doesn't even make top 6 in Manchester
Seems like Ronaldo was right all along
Glazer family made Man Utd into a joke.
UR GETTING SACKED IN THE MORNING!
Don't you just love it 😂😂
Ten Haag for life
If that "handball" had been at the other end, VAR would have allowed the goal to stand.
cherrrr for Harry Maguire 😂😂😂
They haven't stunned me
What happened to man united they played better than i thought 😂
That's a terrible disallowed goal. Football is done
7 losses is crazy 😂😂😂😂
how is ten hag not sacked yet
Manager of the month and player of the month get beat 3-0 by Bournemouth at home 😂😂😂😂
How does Onana let in one's like the 2nd one?? At this level basic!
Is this Onana's fault too?
ETH....thank you! Just like Ethereum, you went up and then came down. Your mission is clear, the same template as exemplified by Leeds and Sheff. Weds.
Definitely ball to hand but the refs love to help manu at old trafford
😂😂😂😂😂😂
So happy utd lost
How are United only 3 points behind City 😅
The Premier League never fails to deliver with giant killing matches. Tonight though it didn't happen.
Good effort my united
I think man united fans now need to realize that the epl is now a multipolar league the days of one team dominating will come to an end. And the team with the most resources will go far. Any team can beat anyone. They have the resources and they will spend less than you and still beat you. Other teams are now catching up to the top 4 in terms of being a disruptor. My advice to man united fans. Your more fun to watch when you lose than when you win 😂
I thought we had it bad (spurs) United nearly got pumped 4-0 by Bournemouth 😂
Its the glazers fault and also the fault of the leaky roof
My club a joke
Surely Ten Hag has got to go now.
Supporting Man U is a testament of loyalty and patience
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Be honest, we all laughed 2 days ago at Tottenham and Newcastle, didn't we?
United beat Chelsea thinking they were going to keep winning 😂😂😂😂😂
And you're telling me maguire got POTM?
Ian Wright called it on Stick to Football
Ref had under 3.5
Shittest players I’ve ever seen
any sing of the hair dryer flying around the home changing room?
Harry maguire got player of the month and then he woke up remembered he’s Harry maguire and dropped an absolute stinker 😂🤣
Newcastle fan here.   Well Done Bournemouth. 👍
Everyone loves seeing united lose
IS this supposed to be a shocking result?Would be more surprised if Man United won😅
They all getting sacked in the morning
Don’t let United being 6th place fool you, they’ve been absolutely awful and deserve to be in the bottom half of the table the way they’ve played this season.
Everyone loves to see United lose, and thanks to Onana and Ten Hag, it's happening.
"He's got his angles right to be fair... because it's hit the post..."  Hmmm... I didn't know football was all about hitting the posts! 🤦‍♂
United got lucky. Should have been five or six.
more like theater of nightmares....
Absolutely awful defensive display. Congratulations Bournemouth as for Utd it's back to the drawing board
Deep cavities in utd that have been sealed & resealed for years all coming to surface now..
This team is getting worse 🥸
Onana is ahiite
Maguire man of the match again.
can't wait for their Anfield visit.
That was 4-0
Imagine bou Vs Liv 😮
Should have been 5-0 well done bournmouth
Sackable offence this.
United are absolutely shite
The third goal for Bournemouth was a keystone cop moment for the Manchester United defence.
4th goal should have stood ball to hand nothing wrong  with that
also on a side note. What the hell was that disallowed goal? keeper makes contact it flies off as he is sprinting? Is it just me that thinks decisions like that just ruin games? I mean i know it was 3-0 already and my damn team lost but that should have been 4
At least VAR helped ease the scoreline😂
It's like playing amateur level on Fifa 😂 . Well done  Bournemouth
Terrible performance from Utd. Not for the first time over recent time. Defence all over the show.
O NANA GOING FOR THE RECORD OF ALLOWING MOST GOALS 😂
give ten hag time, he's doing a brilliant job!
Ten Haag is terrible, his player handling, media skills, tactics, signings.  Horrendous. It’s beautiful.
It’s impossible to tell which Man UTD will turn up these days 🤷🏽
Mate its getting embarrassing for them now😂
LOL
Come again Old Trafford? you telling me now you dont even win against bottom half teams and lose by 3? I am starting to think being a man utd fan needs to come with a disclaimer about being addicted to rollercoasters on a daily basis. Come on guys get it together and get back to playing atleast well enough.
Onana is so bad
Manchester united have the quality to make everyone look good
For that crap win Bournemouth will now lose 4 games in a row  Enjoy you lucky crap goals
United have more losses this season than prime Liverpool and city get across a full 3, but remember eras end
the trouble with manure is that they keep turning corners, and getting terribly dizzy.
At least arsenal lost as well
Man united at its best 😂 .
What are utd playing at 3  0 defeat at home come on 😢
Onana being in the way of the shot didn’t stop him pulling off the most incredible match fixing in world football
I wonder who United's next interim manager will be...
Ooopps. 😂
Good effort from the underdogs United
Haagis ten got to go
ETH manager of the month 😂😂
There should be a massive Cherry on top of Old Trafford.
Midtable club since 2013 😂
Does Maguire ever mark a man,  his positioning is non existent he always appears to be jumping around at the end of the move.
Shaw at centre back 😂😂😂 Martial in the squad, let alone starting 😂😂😂 Dalot full stop anywhere 😂😂😂😂
The Manchester United we have all missed dearly
Liverpool slowly on the horizon
Harry maguire....hey you guys, I head ball I defend I do 😂 sorry but I'd like to think that's how he talks and when he meets haaland they both talk like that 😂😂 haaland says....I soot bol you pass me I score gol 😂😂
AS A UTD FAN ,AND IVE GIVE OVER BOTHERING ,SHOULDNT THAT 4TH GOAL HAVE BEEN A PEN COZ IT ONLY HIT HIS HAND AFTER BANANA CARTED HIM
Ten hag was never a good coach ronaldo was spot on rashford should leave if ten hag stays .
Man utd....the gift that keeps giving 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Handball rule is a joke, if its clearly accidental it shouldn't be handball.
Egg
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What on earth 🌎 has happened to Manchester United 🤔
Hate taking away from a super result for Bournemouth but one can't ignore the woeful manner of the goals conceded by Man United.  Don't know when their players will perform even switch off during games and don't make themselves hard to score against and beat.  Pep and Klopp would struggle to get a tune out of that group of players never mind Ten Hag.
Sir Erik ten Haag delivers again! KEEP IT UP!!! 👏🏼
Man United never fails to entertain us. GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED
The goalie is hilarious 😂
Biggest club in the world 👏👏😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂
MOURINHO WAS THE ISSUE???? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Embarrasing
😅😅😅😅😅😅
On way home from this game,we were brilliant today,we were never in any danger of losing and instead of thinking united were dreadful the fact is AFCB were just fantastic,well done boys..
Nah, the commentator should’ve said this is the GLAZING of the cherries
Man Utd huffed and puffed all game and to lose concentration at critical moment in our own half was criminal. They didn't respect Bournemouth at all.
Taxi, Eric!!
deja vu
Onana is when you put CPU goalkeeper skill to 0 on FIFA.
I can hardly contain myself,,best result ever..😂😂😂😂
This manager made a big  mistake getting rid of De Gea and he should of kept Ronaldo to build the team around him. Man united team can not compete with the top 3 with this squad.
Bring back Greenwood immediately. This PC crap has gone far enough.
Bournemouth aren't worried about relegation this season and it shows
still they got a couple of trophies for november,,,  its not all bad news,,,
Man utd breaking the wrong records since Fergie left
I said to my mate that united were still poor against chelsea it just that chelsea were worse
Bring rubbernose back 😂😂😂
De gea saved man utd so many times,  and now his replacement is pretty average its easy goals 😂
TO BE MANAGER AND PLAYER OF THE MONTH YOU HAVE TO BE GARBAGE
No surprises here! I predicted we'd lose after beating Chelsea. Hi fickle fans!
LOVELY
Sacked in the morning 🎶 ya gettin sacked in the morning 🎵 sacked in the MOOOOOORNING 😂
Waiting for Gary neville podcast now
Man United  are a great side😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Player of the month, manager of the month and goal of the month to this 😂
Well done Bournemouth.
Maguire's 13th start in a row... Cursed! 💀
As a Leeds man i love it!!😂
Onana the Frog. I've never seen a goalkeeper leap for absolutely everything. Palmer goal he should be scurrying across to save but he leaps, Biling header right at him and instead of staying solid for a potential tip over, he leaps again but in a time delay.
As a Liverpool fan it's actually great to see one of the great old clubs, and European Cup winners, doing so good. And better than the Premier league new money teams.
Good results for united and arsenal today, keeps them in the hunt for top 4.
Ten Haag manager of the month.😂 Maguire player of the month. 🤣.  Cryin ere
harry magiure the ‘flop’is like the 3rd best player as  mctominay is 1st garnacho cheese 2nd and magiure the “flop” 3rd this is crazy
The era of Fergie time , Howard Webb and dodgy fixtures are way over !!
To the rest of the premier league....glad we made your weekend! Up the cherries 🍒
Maguire on walkabouts again.
They won their awards and called it a day 😂
-4 goal differance too
Even as a liverpool fan, this was hard to watch
Just shows how bad chelsea were
Haha
Rihanna did say “Oh Na Na, Whats a save?”
TAV IS TOO GOOD
Evra is still my best defender of MU!
2 names I have seen for years and I can’t understand how they still play here…. Maguire and Shaw, let alone other that are just average…
Is it not cherry on the icing on the cake…..?
''icing on the cherries cake'' lmao
Ten hag.  Time to go
The 1st and 2nd goal would have been stopped by “De Gea” maybe ineffective from his feet but was a shot stopper
Shame🤔🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
As a Man U fan Bournemouth 100% deserved this we were shocking and I can’t believe harry maguire has become our best player
Onana is the worst goalkeeper ive ever seen the way he jumps for literally anything and misses 😂
“Man U are the most in form team in the prem”
Wow Man U is failing bad!
Man united need to retire, seriously
Manager of the month Player of the month
First goal was shambolic.
I saw the score on google I thought my eyes or phone was tripping then I remembered it’s Manchester United 😂😂😂
There's no issue with the players press not told the truth. Lol
Hahahaha
C'mon whats the point of denying them the 4th goal. Damage already done.
My liver can't handle being a united fan
🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣 are you Spurs in disguise
Might be time on ten hag.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 EMBARRASSING FOR BOURNEMOUTH 4TH GOAL SHOULD BE GIVEN HOW CAN YOU HAVE CAKE WITH NO ICING 🎉🎉🎉🎉 WILL MAN UTD SURVIVE THE RELEGATION THIS SEASON???????????🎉
This is how bad the situation is at the moment I’m a life long united fan and the state that this club has been in the last 10 I find myself watching more and more Liverpool and Arsenal highlights
Anthony isn’t worth his wages on a free transfer.
I am always love when the underdog wins. Well maybe another time :D
Not looking forward to anfield gonna get shat on
How is ten haag son not lookin forward to his p45 yet
I mean can it get any funnier?  I think it can.
Bournemouth in a false position credit to them for sticking with their manager even when it wasnt great they will be looking up this season not over their shoulders
Full credit to Bournemouth, they are proving a real challenging side to beat when they are up for it. Absolutely deserved the win.
Manchester Disunited.
Magurie back to doing magurie things🤣🤣🤣
Maugire is not even bad
Maguires back in form 😂
Just goes to show how bad Chelsea really are from a suffering chelsea fan
Ten Haag: no crisis  Bournemouth: hold my jacket
Nice. Very nice indeed.
At least they won something this season , BEST MOTM AND BEST DOTM. Successs!!!😂😂
Amazing counter attack
I know the decision made no difference in the end but the handball that canceled out the 4th goal seems a bit harsh
My god and it could have been 5-0 too lol. Off the post and disallowed..
Can't wait for Liverpool xDDD
I don't even know what to think of United anymore, even in the games they win, it's hardly ever convincing. They're a mess and feel like a team of solos with no eagerness to play. What is even the reason as to how they get to this point, I genuinely don't know. The scouting, the manager, the tactics, the players individually themselves being poor?
Man utd manager needs to understand that man utd are not a top team and need to play counter attack football untill they are good enough to play up the pitch
That disallowed goal should have been a penalty surely?
I know solanke was bought from Liverpool but is he scouse? Played with fire in his belly today he was brilliant
This was painful to watch, Fernandez is not a leader and also seems like every other match he falls over and tries it on for a foul.
Ah yes..good 'ol harry..what a class defender..
The only people are the Merseyside refuse collectors
As a united fan i can honestly say we need a new keeper and our players from injury back asap!!!!!!
Harry Maguire is awful awful awful
Man utd just can't cope when the play big teams 😂😂😂
Can’t wait to see what Roy Keane has to say 😢about
Coming up in next week's highlight package we watch Liverpool carve United to pieces in a repeat 7-0 win. Goals by Gapko, Salah (3), Van Dijk, Nunez and Tsimikas keep Liverpool top of the league
😂😂😂😂🥳
Come January players need gone, buy a support striker for holjund and strength the fullback positions, rotate let some the young hunger players on the pitch
Man u lost cos bournemouth wore a kit that looks like watford🤣🤣🤣
Ten Hag at the wheel 😂 Next up Anfield 😂😂😂⚰
"Stun"
Win all the monthly awards and then today 😂
More then a football game looks like a shoot on target 😂😂 thanks Good Ronaldo left poor fella
Dalot is so bad I can't handle it
ManGuire United
everyone will always focus on how bad the big team are rather than how good the small team is
We can’t blame Onana or Sancho for This one!
ah yes man u back to there best
Is STUN really the right word to be using? Don’t think anyone’s stunned by this result
😂😂😂
In the last 3 goals(incl. the disallowed one) the defence resemble of something of League 1 teams I watch from time to time..
We will be there, and here we are
Ten hag wont sleep well tonight 😂
How much longer are Manchester United,  going to put up with this so called manager, the fella just is not good enough, right enough half of that team are not worth even playing.....its time for a change....
Onana at it again 🤣
Ridiculous that the last one was disallowed. 0-4 in my opinion.
How did ten hag win manager of the month 💀
manchester united never makes people disappointed
Maguire  ... che pippa!
Great Championship team
What a laugh Man United is! 😅
Onana was playing.. I was wondering who was the statue in the goal..
This is manager of the month aswell 😂😂
Man Utd are actually a banter team now …
STUN is a strong word… the real shocker is then only scoring 3!
hahahahahahaha
Wasnt it 4-0? (It says 3-0 on the title)
Hahahaha what a day it’s been as a Liverpool fan
Unbelievable Jeff unbelievable 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man utd and Tottenham remember who they supposed to be, it’s a nice thing.
Whens he getting sacked they sacked mourinho for less
Harry Maguire winning the player of the month was the biggest insult to young talented players of all top 6 teams.
ON BEHALF OF MANCHESTER UNITED I PRAY OUR SINS TO BE FORGIVEN,WE ARE PAYING FOR OTHER PEOPLES SIN
The fact onana was compared to becker is the best joke I've heard since they said Anthony was the signing of the year
How shite were Chelsea on Tuesday
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Lfc 😢 sad to see the fall of united. 😅❤ had My fingers crossed 🤞
Should have been 6
United are back
LOVE IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT   shoulda been 0-6
Ten Hag has gotta go now
Manchester is playing like weather forecast 😅
5 top managers and these players still cant perform?? I dont think management is the problem!!
The ps5 for Christmas is overshadowed by all the gifts united have been giving all season
Manager and player of the month everyone...
nice to united playing well as usal with love from a liverpool fan
H Mcguire man of the match?
Onana's hands are like Marty McFly's while he's waiting for his da to kiss his ma at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.
Wee tav is some pler!
could be deja vu all over again man utd next league game is at anfield could this be 2 managers in a row sacked after playing Liverpool
First goal sums up man utd, lazy overpaid players who do not fight for the badge 🤦🏻‍♂️
Onana the bad banana 😂😂
Hold up why is the fourth disallowed his touched the ball wih his hand because the keeper has caught him leaving him unbalanced surely it should have stood or a penalty should have been given shocking decision
The manager has completely lost the dressing room, they're playing to get him the sack! There can be no other reason for that kind of performance, that takes nothing away from Bournemouth who were worthy winners!
ahahahahaha omg im gun!y drink out i swear xD xD xD what a laughing stock
I hope Liverpool have a buy back Clause for solanke really finding his form.these days
Mufc are the weirdest team ever, they are capable off beating the best teams in the world and then they can loose against poor teams
And United back to normal again
I blame Joel glazer
Lol 3-0 to Bournemouth at HOME? And people are saying ETH stays!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow!!
Luke shaw is keek
Bournmouth could of scored 5 or 6
So kanji is like firminio
Looks like we're going to get yet another United manager the sack...Anfield next 😂😂😂
how is that a handball lmao, ball is pinging around all over the place and the dude just got clattered and is trying to not fall over. Refs are a joke.
Onana is so good at getting  the ball out of his net
Who has the worst fans for moaning in the league Man Utd or arsenal?
Ya know, if manc utd played with a goalkeeper sometimes they might stand half a chance
Fantastic. Thank you Bournemouth, I hate Man U 🙏👏
They need to revise the handball rules.
Who is stunned nobody that's watched united since sir Alex retired are stunned
No one is stunned
This has to be one of the weirdest season the prem has seen
2nd goal he fouls luke shaw
united had var on their side and still got battered by bournemouth at old trafford😭
United's running on fumes. Glazers will wish they took the 6bn the Qatari's offered them in the Summer, because now it's only going to be about 1 or 2bn come the season end
Eric's at the wheel...
😂😂😂😂😂😂 poor scummers
😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Man who? Wonder what flat cap has to say…
hated, adored, never feared
Martial was absolutely hopeless,  there has to be somebody better than that in the academy or something! Should be made leave in January.
Brilliant from Bournemouth but from a United perspective, each one of those goals is a horror show.
All I can say is well done Bournemouth, could have been worse for us. Proper team performance, proper spirit. Made us look an absolute joke so fair play.
that is absolutely terrible for united and guess what i support them.
Cherries fan. Couldn't be buzzing more. Christmas come early
It could have been 5 😂 easily
Chelsea should explain what happened midweek
worst united performance since last week
Haha Ridiculous Man United is such falling apart
The fact that Joel Glazer didn't close down Solanke for the first goal is criminal
The amount of possession we had aswell is ridiculous. We just couldn’t score and Bournemouth could.
Love how much people hate Man U lmao
It's time to go
I'm I the only man utd fan that simply wants ten hag gone ?
Keeper just jumps & puts his hands up for the sake of it. No effort to get to the ball
Man Utd fans.....your boys took one hell of a beating....0-3 flattered your boys!
Man U - the football equivalent of the Emperor's New Clothes. You can't believe what you ate seeing.  Awful. 😮
Watching Man United keeper seethe is so funny
😂😂😂😂😂
Bring Ferguson back
Haha.. £1 Billion In Debt! In Comes Sir Jim Who Can’t Clear This Debt.. Who Will Make More Debt With A Team Playing Like This! Give It Another 10-15Years Before They Get 2nd Place Again!
Utd are a disgrace sack manager and sack players
These var decisions are a joke . The lad was off balance so arms go everywhere . Should have been allowed and 4 nil not 3 !
Nothing stunning about Man Utd getting smashed again...
United are lost with Maguire. Holy baby Jesus 😪
I’m starting to think that they got lucky against Chelsea……
HAHAHAHAAHAHA WHo buy it a Match ???  The gol keeper ISNT MOVE AT HIS DOOR !!!!
Please show more of the home crowd's faces.
Stun ? In form bournemouth beat a weak utd
Liverpool fan here I can’t wait to see what happens at Anfield
I wouldn't exactly call that a shock lol
Hahahahah
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ia not the team..TenHag is the worst manager, to proud and full oh himself.. he should go ..
Ten Hag : Premier league manager of the month.
Disgraceful
Finally, normal service has resumed.
That 4th goal being disallowed will not improve the situation for United's season. They will still end up relegation candidates ;)
That var goal should have been allowed .....
That was the best 3-0 performance I’ve seen, Maguire and tan hag motm/potm twice on the bounce ?
Why couldn't Chelsea do this. Well done Bournemouth AFC 🎉🎉🎉🎉😂❤
Congratulations Bournemouth
I'm old enough to remember the days when Man United would have beat Bournemouth! Shows how old I really am.
Stun is a strong word 😂
Hit the post and one disallowed and still 0-3 United got hammered
Man united is a weird team
I hate that screaming commentator
As a Newcastle fan getting rinsed for losing at Bournemouth with half a squad by my Man Utd mates... this is completely and utterly hilarious...  Well done Bournemouth
Lol love it,ha ha,goodbye ten hag
Cant even blame Onana for this one.
We’ll done Bournemouth
Man utd are a disgrace. £1.4 billion net spend since Fergie left, look where they are . Shambles
Liverpool gonna score 13 😂
Ridiculous to disallow the fourth goal.  Onano fouled Ouattara.  The officials clearly don't understand football.
Happy days
Describe match  in one word
Ten Hag revolution in full swing.
That wasnt a handball he was off balancr
As a chelsea fan this is catharsis
That's what you get when you hire a manager from a minor league, and whose strategy  is to pay over the odds for players he worked with in those leagues. Why the surprise?
😂😂😂
But , but, but we beat chelsea we're back 😂😂😂😂😂
as a neutral....the 4th should also have stood, joke decision to give handball
Now every club can come to Old Trafford and easily take 3 points. Man U after sir Alex will never reborn. It does not look like it happens. I do not know how many managers since Ferguson retirement have been sitting on the bench and how much they wasted money on The Old Trafford. Shame.
nothing better than watching man u get slapped
Great performance by the player and manager of the month fully deserved
Liverpool will get Erik ten fraud the sack next weekend
McGuire the goalkeeper and the manager need to get the boot.
The cherry on top
Onans what a Gk😂😂
How the mighty shallt falleth 😂 UTV
SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE AND QUICKY , half those players need to go , and the pressure is definitely ramping up on Ten hagg
Harry maguire🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hahahahahahaha
😂😂😂
This makes us chelsea look even worse 😂😂😂
Ferguson curse goes on😄
From 2:09 to 2:36, you could see the crowd emptying after the third goal
Bye bye Eric and take Onana with you 😂
I miss the manu of 20 years ago
Love this United side 🤣🤣🤣
Blame Ronaldo
One step forward two back 🤦🏻‍♂️
That's never a handball, what else is he supposed to do? Should've been 4-0
As a Liverpool fan, I just can’t wait too see United at Anfield next weekend! 😂😅
Empty seats at 2-0 😂😂 real supportive
U can't blame rashford this time ...
0:11 Maguire.. 1:20 Maguire... 2:10 Maguire..2:36 Who... Maguire.. And Vs Newcastle.. Offside cause Maguire.. All topped up with Onana who defends like me in my prime days in AKS Mikołów 5th amateur league in my prime days.. Maguire player of the month.. Yeah sure.. How long you gonna pretend he and Onana are vital players for MU?
My question is: How the 4th goal is disallowed? Ridiculous...
Luke Shaw whats the score? Any excuses 😂😂
Man Ure
Manager and player of the month btw 😂
If the back 4 defended like Erik Ten Hag defends Anthony Martial they'd be top of the league already, he just will not say ANYTHING negative about Anthony Martial
Let's all laugh at Manchester United!!! Again... 😂😂😂
Fingers crossed, they'll keep on sinking. :)
The problem is ronaldo doesn't press
And again they will sack the manager but the same will happen again and again and again unless they change all from the top
Embarrassing performance
The Utd fowards did well to get nil. Good job,boys.
It's a funny old game....
Should have been 4 - 0 that last goal counts for me
...United players...no appetite to play...defenders wher acting like they where playing in the backyard... all goals where conceded because of insistence of Burnemhout and laziness of United... United players waiting that someone else to stop the attack... they underestimate Burnemhout ...
Yes ! Man u back to winning ways.
Falling apart again 😂😂😂😂😂
It’s always McGuire involved or last defender and they always score pass him or he blocks the keepers view! I’m no Man U fan but he’s uttter useless 😊
That 4th dissalowed goal, Maguire didn't look over his shoulder, hence lost ball possession easily.. he really needs to learn basics.
Oh nanana ohnanana oh na na oh na na 😂😂😂
Chelsea seems a long time ago! Points lost that should be in the bag. This loss will cost.
Fantastic result. Well done Bournemouth.
Jesus Christ
Solanke deserves an England place
Well played Bournemouth ❤
We'res rio and Gary hibernateing 😂😂😂😂
Should have been four
Is always nice seeing Utd loosing
I think United need to give De Gea a call 😅😅
The fact that Man Utd were dreading if there was any more time. Just shows us how Man Utd are back
Haha Man Utd
If the roof wasnt leaking united would of done better
Cr7 ❤
How did ten hag Win manager of the month 😭😭😭💀😭💀😭💀😭
Man U fan,,,, never handball
How was that goal disallowed lmao. That's insane
Harry Maguire player of the month and Erik hag manager of the month, the media are ridiculous. Imagine giving Harry Maguire a personal trophy.
Anfield here we come I'm going 8 0 😂😂😂😂😂
It really could have been 5-0 and United were lucky to get away with only 3-0. Brutal. They are absolutely shocking.
Andre banana
Playing Martial ....sack him
He was literally falling when he touched the ball, what do you want him to do?
Man utd are back
And you all wanted to give maguire player of the month 😂😂 this club is nothing but an embarrasement
Club needs a reset
This is not surprising at all... what is surprising is when united win
Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville have reportedly  signed for Man United and will be on the subs bench for all of the Christmas matches.
VAR ruining the sport should be 4-0
Glory hunter are gonna be real confused with this one💀
This is a new low for Man Utd. I remember them doing the treble 😂
hahahahahaha
Very clever of Bruno Fernandes to pick up a Fifth Yellow card - Automatic one Match Ban He will miss the Massacre at Anfield  next Sunday - Just what you want from your captain Match reports say he hacked down a Bournemouth player in the 89th Minute  He was lucky not to get a Red Card 😀😀😀
Best Christmas present ever 😂
Ole out!
Hahahahahaaaaaaaa. Love from Leeds.
Like in de Gea times, this is great!
Absolutely shocking the club is absolute joke
Trouble being tmr the media will be talking about how poor Man Utd was, where as they should be talking about how poor Bournemouth made them look.  Super performance by each and every one of them today..
Onana has got to be the biggest fraud in footballs history 😂 how he plays for 1 of the biggest teams on the planet only god nose 😅 as a united for for over 30 years I'd say he's the worst keeper we've ever had
What a shocker 😮
I've gone beyond pain and anger as a Man Utd. The more we lose, the less I care.
How was Bournemouth’s 4th goal disallowed? If I was the player I would be the same trying to gain balance and you can tell it was accidental and he would have scored even if it didn’t scrap his hand?
Even though Ten Hag got manager of the month for November, look at the teams UTD beat! Fulham, Luton and Everton. None of them in particularly convincing fashion (wonder goal by Garnacho was memorable) UTD were also winless in all other comps in November. A reality check today with this result and Anfield next week for them…
What a horrible club that used to be the best. It always comes from the top down. Disaster & horrible throughout the hole club. Rotten
It should of been 4, Utd are not a good side
I’m a United fan and hate watching this team used to get excited for match days now I just wish it was end of season.
Solanke Liverpool legend
Fat head maguire  will have his mate fathead allerdyce  as next manager 😅😅..cant wa8 till next week..8_0..ynwa ❤❤
Onana always try to make the goal look supperd . should be in Hollywood rather then football
Ahh this gets even better. Liverpool bagged the 3 points and Man united got done by 3 goals 😂
As a Chelsea fan I'm very happy United lost, W Bournemouth 🔥🔥🔥❤
Man United have turned in to a club where players go to retire,no spark or passion.
Wow the United decline since Fergie left is shocking
This is our manager of the month, totally deserved
Reguillon, Dalot, Antony, Bruno, Martial are shite.
Maguire.....
Definitely not doing the harry maguire sbc
I wish I had a tenner on that score.
The defending of that first goal was absolutely abysmal.
Theatre  of memes. 😅😅😅
Did man united even create any chances at home ? this could've easily been 0-5
the only embarresment here is the premier league for giving TH and HM those awards for last month tbh
What a preformance from maguires man u!! definately deserved potm!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂. Thanks, made my Saturday night.
4-0
Manager of the month player of the month
Ten Hag In
😂😂😂😂😂
Man United have never been the same since sir geat Alex retired. Ten hag like all the other managers since Alex will know how they felt trying to turn united back to UNITED
Liverpool next - last season it was 7 🥲
As a United fan that was never handball. 4-0.
Get the green and gold scarfs out and then crawl back under your rocks 😂😂😂
As for the 4th goal, had that had been a defenders hand that would not have been a pen because the player could not have got his hand away, so VAR cheated Bournemouth.
Top performance from the cherries, as for utd 😂😂😂 stock ,🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿  What next for the manager, ?
Great game !!! 😉
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jacob Maguire.
😂😂😂😂😂
How much more man.
Bayern have told their 1st XI to have the week off, and have instead sent their under 11s for the midweek game.   They'll win 4-0.
That is unacceptable result at home ground  😡
That’s my player of the month 🐐 😂
I'm a newcastle fan but how did Manchester United loose
Could of been 5-0
LOL
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I am not a Utd fan or a Utd hater....... but sometimes I watch them and I think please get Harry McGuire off the pitch. It's at the point I honestly feel bad for him. It's embarrassing to watch. Let's just all agree to let him go home, never play football again and we'll just forget any of this ever happened. Really it's for the best for everybody.
I guess that's it for Eric. Some of the players clearly weren't trying very hard. Disgraceful, but you can't sack them, so the manager is always the one to go.
How’s was that disallowed?
Absolutely nothing wrong at all with that disallowed Bournemouth 'goal'!
Glory , glory Cherries
That was not handball. Hand ball is supposed to be deliberate!! Good to see MU are even more Spursy than Spurs.
The wrost manager in all time mut
Manchester United played well as everyone expected Bournemouth to win 10-0. I hope that Manchester will lose the next 20 games with a minimum score. The championship awaits Chelsea and Manchester United in the next 2-3 years.
The Chelsea game was 3 days ago, United decided to have a day off 🤦‍♂️
Liverpool away in the league next😮😮😮😮
Onana is genuinely the worst keeper I've ever seen in the league
They got Liverpool next…
Ain’t no way these players are taking home money for THAT performance
United fans deserve this for standing by the Glazers
Onana what's your name lol  Better than Alisson they said 😂😂😂
God help us against Munich and Liverpool
Liverpool next game watch united win some how lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Utd cant live with a well organised, motivated , properly coached team. Ten Haag has to take responsibility. It’s not just the players . It’s his selections. How can they screw up today when 5th place was in their grasp ? No excuse for it . ETH needs to look at his coaching staff and himself.
Just to put this into perspective, VAR robs them of a 4th, disgraceful decision really. Also, with Solanke hitting the post it could have easily been 5. Just in case anyone thought it couldn't get any worse. 😂
Just watched us (Brighton) draw 1-1 with Burnley. This has helped
I know he is such a scapegoat, but it's so true. Onana is a horrific goalkeeper, 2/3 goals were such easy saves.
Sorry and you have Maguire player of the month SORRY!  Lol😂
The fourth was a goal no way deliberate hand ball
The only shock about this result is it should have been 6-0. Sorry but Manure are a fallen giant. No longer the Big Club they once were.
This what happens when you give player of the month awards to terrible defenders. All goes to their head.
Manager of the Month and the Player of the Season. 😅
😭 what have we come to Man U 😭 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Sancho wondering he how can get back in the team as he trains with the U18s
Must of been to wet and cold
Martial,Dalot, Mctominay ( only at CDM),Reguilon, Rashford (for now ) are all crap they are a waste ETH needs to be more strict he's letting these players get away with all this especially with Rashford 🤬🤬🤬💀😞
.... BOURNEMOUTH 😅😅😅😅😅😅
You need to look at the players  not the manager. It's a players revolt. Wake up
Just when you're down about your own team (City) playing shite, you can always rely on United to cheer you up again.
I cant remember the last time ive actually seen Onana save something
Oh well back to the drawing board ..😅 gotta feel sorry for Man U …naa no you ain’t
Gassed after a win against chelshit💀💀midtable mentality
Shambles . After the Chelsea game it just would have been too much to expect more improvement . On their day which happens much too often Man Utd  look like the worst team in the premiership . Lucky they have the points they have . The manager will probably get his marching orders .
yasss united slayed that
that 4th being disallowed was an absolutely digusting decision. Look at the movement of his arm, how is he meant to avoid accidental contact? Well done Bournemouth, from an Everton fan
Just after the Chelsea game where by all accounts they played their best game of the season
This is what happens when you name Harry McGuire player of the month 😂
When it rains it pours!🤣🤣
I hope Ten Hag stays forever
Hahahaha booing then during the game hahahahahahahhaa worse than everton
Manchester United have now lost more Premier League home games since Sir Alex Ferguson retired (35) than they did during his 21 seasons in charge of the club (34).
Proof Luke Shaw is not a centre back
lets all laugh at united 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Theatre of dreams 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Remember when they gave Utd goal, player, and manager of the month 😂😂😂
Awful club 😂😂
The miss casemiro
United are crap
Men against embryos.
Ten hag defo getting the sack at this rate
Last goal wasn’t a handball
As a Chelsea fan, I feel ashamed we lost to this trash team but then again it's Chelsea 🥲
See ladies and gentlemen,the underdogs do always lose 😂😂
Maguire without a shred of doubt has been uniteds best player this season
I’ll say it again. Shambles of a club 😂😂
I was there. Bournemouth were good. United were shocking... Hopeless.. Should've been 4 or 5 nil really...
Why does ETH play Shaw at centre half (moving Maguire from his preferred side in the process)?
From a Manchester United fan... LOL
Utd need to look for a new manager .
Haag will be back in Holland before the end of the season
😂😂😂😂
Haha I predicted this 😂
Solanke ex liverpool player gets the first
Solanke summoning up prime Firmino mode for a few moments 😅
Honestly, if I was Man Utd’s scout, I would sign Philip Billing.
Good job they let the only goalscoring threat Ronaldo go, he was holding the team back from its full potential of delivering us worldclass meme football from the theatre of mediocrity everyweek. Thank you ten hagen daas. Keep multiple champions league and worldcup winner Varane on the bench, don't play casemiro, don't re-sign de gea and all you yanited fans saying ten haag out, well unless lampard is ready to take the job you better trust the process and stick with him.
🤣🤣🤣
Didn't watch the game but the highlights are all Bournemouth attacking?!? 😮 😅  Good grief United and well deserved Cherries!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🔥
Man United 0 - 3 Bournemouth at Old Trafford, shows it's a waste of time predicting football.  Iraola starting to show what he can do. Some result for Bournemouth.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This says a lot more about Chelsea than it does United lol how on earth did Chelsea lose to this United team
Finished club , Maguire POTM 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well here we go again beat again   next in the league is Liverpool.. Liverpool will win about 7 again    . Manager needs to go.  He's out of his league.. roy Keane please come to man utd as manager
I have no words, just emojis...       😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Absolutely class united 😂
To be fair it was wet
Not sure it's much of a "STUN" atp.
😆😅🤣😂😆😅🤣😂😅😂😆😅😂
Man utd fans are to blame
Only United can have coach and player of the month and lose the same week 😂
Lucky that 4th goal didn't stand, Watford 4 United 0 was Ole's last game.
Let's all laugh at the Whiskynose Wanderers😂
Little Bournemouth, UTC 3😂
Penchester 😂😂😂😂😂
My 2 year old daughter was laughing at the end 😂😂
Motm & potm pahaha
Old Trafford looked pretty empty at the start of the game, and totally empty by the 70th minute. True fans support their team through the highs and lows. This isn’t aimed at all Utd fans - the only ones triggered by this take are likely those that it resonates with.
I buzzing like mad about it 😊😊
Cant wait for liverpool play united. Might just be 10-0
Man U are back in business
Could have been 5 or 6 very poor. Only one United in the north and that’s 💛💙🤍
What are utd doing rn? Never seen such chaos at 1 club. The fact they in the top ten blows my mind. Well they got give the first 3 point againt wolves. Shocking result should have been deducted.
Onana I'm sorry but this is becoming a joke in all fairness there's not much better in front of u but the worst shot stopper I've seen in a united shirt
Theatre of dreams....just playing Comedy Club these days
the taxi is getting nearer and nearer
Lol gg
Maguire back on form 😂
Onana still the goalkeeper still baffles me 😂😂😂😂
Can't wait for the goldbridge special 😢
GO IN THE NAME OF GOD
Man Divided
Harry at it again
Man United the gift that keeps on giving 😂😂😂
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Maguire is abysmal
It's the present of ze United
The way the Man Utd pundits and fans were going on you'd have thought that Man Utd had completely destroyed Chelsea. The only reason United won was that Chelsea are just worse than a poor United team.
Jesus how awful are man United? 😂
If yu support Utd you might aswell start supporting liverpool
hahaha
😂😂😂
Ladies and gentlemen, MAN UTD IS BACK!
Ten Hag's got them playing entertaining football I see
Rashford  Martial  Maguire Pellestri Bruno   They all have to go. Absoloutely abysmal. How many managers do these players want to go through
Utd the gift that keeps on giving 🎉 😂😂😂
Bournemouth are not a  team to think  3 points in  the bag  , as a Liverpool supporter i concur
😂😂😂😂 we may be crap at the moment but we won’t ever be worse than you rags
Again one step forward, two steps back 🤬
What a header that third goal was. No way that was a handball, it was unavoidable. This game should have finished 5:0.
Harry Maguire this season his in striker position 😂😂😂
VAR still manages to rob Bournemouth LOL
Not even a stun no more 😂
Sack them off get the reserve's in. At least they will play with passion.
I've supported united all my life my dad used to play for Barmouth years ago but my dad and myself have always been united fans onana is the problem at united he is a letting goals on left right and centre bring back david best keeper in the world
Yay
The league want there monthly awards bak,
17th December Liverpool v Manchester United
United beat Chelsea and its "the players fought for the badge" United lose to Bournemouth and its "nine players and the manager must go".
Welcome back man utd😂
Harry maguire 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The table flatters them and today showed exactly what they are about. As for Bournemouth thanks for making my weekend. MCFC OK
Oh well back to the drawing board. Every 2 years 😂 going round and round again. Wondering who they will bring now and who they will get rid off. Too afraid to get rid that's their problem...lol .... Liverpool should win 9- 0
Get the Norwich scarfs out
At least 10 players just need to go, so they're not even an option anymore. They've been given plenty of opportunities to prove their worth with appearances and enough is enough for united. Sell them at the end of the season, and get the finger out
The 4th goal should have stood. His arm was down, and the keeper tripped him... he gained no advantage from it because he still had the ball. Quality stuff though!
I think we can all agree that the real reason United lost to Bournemouth was because of the Glazer's. If they had sold up and left the club , then United would have won.
The 3 goals from Bournemouth have been  each been dedicated to player, coach and goal "of the month"😂😂😂
Chelsea win was all for nothing
next up:  • bayern munich, & • liverpool  🙊
Utd are crap 😮
Remember Ronaldo was the problem 🤣🤣🤣  I cant see Haaland out scoring Hoijand this year 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Prime Maguire, hype him when he’s ok but watch him he’s been bullied by strikers especially when they run at him
full of crap this match
Erik Ten Hag lost the dressing room again.
Liverpool aways going to be fun
The boos at the last goal. Ten Hag on his last legs.
🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂
Why?!?!!!!?!! 😭
Irish guy finally being proven right 😂
Harry play of the month Erik manger righto mate 🙄
Change the keeper
Boooo
My lord , this is David and Goliath all over again
United miss De Gea
The Man Utd we know and love. 💜
Cant wait for garys comments 🤣🤣🤣
United are on a tollercoaster😅
I'm normally supporting the underdogs in games. Sadly today it wasn't to be
Go now, ETH!!
The gift that keeps on giving.
We need better another 300 million spending
Sacked in the morning
Boooooooooooooooooo 😂😂😂
Ahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahaha
United made Bournemouth look world class today.. they're a team of many wonders 😆😆  Slab played his part brilliantly too. £85M worth of sheer class 😁 Long may it continue 💪😂👑
Just give Altay a chance, how naive can Manchester United Manager be it's unbelievable. And the player's need a really hyped up manager not a low toned man.
Oh dear 😂😂😂
Man United. The gift that keeps on giving. 😂😂😂👌
hahahahhahahahahahhahaha
Always great to see Utd get humiliated 😂
Gross demolition at the theatre of nightmare.
The fact I forgot to put a bet on Bournemouth winning I'm absolutely fuming 😤
Absolute shocker from VAR on that last goal...UP THE CHERRIES...😁🍒❤
Muck fc
Pmsl hahahahahaahah😂🎉😂🎉😂
Oops
This will all get lost in the criticism of the super club, but Bournemouth played an awesome game against a United team on a solid run of league results minus the Newcastle game, Iraola is building something here 👏 🍒
Ten Hag must stay!!!
The best result this weekend, well done Bournemouth
Another loss again
Nothing stunning about the result 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
It's so fitting to lose 3-0 after their "hat-trick" of Awards last month😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 There's no greater joy than seeing this
👹👹 absolute joke 👹👹
Ahh once again Manchester United loosing to teams where they should win but loose
Cometh the time, cometh the original United😂
The real United are back ....phew
No substitute for heart and desire to win a game or save a game from getting worse but Utd crumbled here. 5 defeats from 7 now by a 2+ goal margin shows a weak/defeatist mentality. And I'm a Man Utd saying this.
What’s the point in even beating Chelsea if you’re just going to throw it away against Bournemouth.
BOUNMOUTh are lucky they just taking revenge
To the person typing the "sad the underdog didn't win today" comment right now. Just let it go. After the 100th ManU and Chelsea loss this season it's just not funny anymore😅
VAR need to have a look and think does his hand actually make a difference because he would of scored anyway
Big sicks this year lol
Love when Man U loose!
Well done Bournemouth, Moan Utd got  beaten again so ha ha ha !
Absolutely took United apart
Man Utd is back!
And this people is your manager if the month 😂
Surely, this must be a record for worst goalkeeping debut season of all time. How many has Onana conceded now? 😂😂
That was just too funny. United in their incompetence
11 individuals 0-3 A team.
Banter United! Love it!!
U cannot keep buying its a failed organisation
2:21 Dalot showing what he thinks of Man United 👃
Clearly the glazers fault, forget about the Chelsea game .
And at home just another great display by a shower of shits. I really hope they replay the bullcrap the untied players was saying after the Chelsea game.
Leaving out Rashford really worked 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
The players think there bigger than the club
Delete club
The decline of Man Utd over the last decade or so is unprecedented in the history of football.
Onana is so bad 😂😂
i'm thinking Onana should be replaced with a subtitute because he's having pretty awful start to the season
That 4th goal should have stood
Onana is shocking
Every goal conceded by messing around when passing out & dfs not being prepared. Bruno, McTominay are hopeless at passing out & the rest are shocked every time they lose it. At what point do we learn the basics? 🤨
How is onana still playing
The demise of United
Goldbridge
you could mistake man utd as a Newley promoted club learning there way.
Every Team wins and every team loses. Its part of life
Sexy bruno leads out Manchester reds...derrrpp
As a chelsea fan am really happy 😂😂
Uniteds passing lacks structure and is slow
Manchester United: the gift that keeps giving 😂
That first goal would be embarrassing for a pub side to concede.
4th goal not deliberate, what a result. YNWA😂😂😂😂
As a Liverpool fan I get more excited about the highlights when United lose than I do when Liverpool win 😂
When players don't wanna play they won't....to much power now...
Manchester United are a disgrace!
Istg who decided to give ETH the manager of the month award
In the end it didn’t matter, but how on earth is that final goal disallowed? Ridiculous decision
Disastrous and terrible but I guess it is to be expected with this woeful United team. I wonder how GNev is feeling right now.
Should have been 4, that was ball to hand
Why is that handball rule a thing, imagine if that had been for a winning goal instead of a 4th.
Ten hag gone by Monday
Were they saying that VAR disallowed the goal because he possibly handled the ball? Because it looked to me like it was his chest.
The weekend starts NOW 😂
Not exactly 'stunning' anymore.
ha ha ha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I would call this a "STUN".😂😂
Loool
Man Utd were shocking. It could easily have been 5-0.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaa!
VAR got that wrong!
So many empty seats at 73 mins in the game 😱
As a united fan I'm happy, speeds up 10 hag demise
A cherrie good win for Bournemouth 😂😂
That should been 4 the handball was accidental
ITS TIME TO GO ERIC
Banchester are back
Great performance from Watford today💪💪
NathanConnor is gonna have a field day 😂😂😂😂
How is that keeper No1 for United.
Should have been 6-0 !  Why any billionaire wants to go near this lot is beyond me
Should be 0-4.... How's meant to get his arm out the way??
Man Utd are bi polar 😂
Agent Ten Hag exceeding even my expectations! Keep up the good work Erik! 😂
This why Rashford needs to leave man u.
Heartbreaking 😂
yup
Baldie is getting sacked in the morning! Ten sacks 😜😜😜😜😜😜😜
It could’ve been 5-0 I don’t have any words for how disappointing this game was Bayern next we’re losing to Bournemouth we can’t even draw it’s either win or lose 🤦🏽‍♂️
God help them next week 😮
That 4th goal should have stood.
This shows you how bad Chelsea are and how bad united were against them. Both teams are a disgrace. Everton will thrash Chelsea tomorrow.
Where was this united against Chelsea 😂😭
Knew United was in a false position just like last season winning games when they been mainly out played or getting referees debatable decisions go in their favour, nice to see Solanke get the winner 😏 I mean Bournemouth played good but united at home should do better 🤔😏
LOL
harry constantly caught ball watching.
In what universe is Shaw at CB better than 5-time Champions League winner Varane?
I thought it was 4 nil?
We have to go through same process as arsenal. Be ruthless. It wasn't until they got rid of ozil, ramsey, aumbeyang, lacazette and co that they started winning and playing well. We have to let go or rashford, scott mctominay , dalot, martial etc no matter how emotional we are about them. They just aren't good enough
How long till Gary Neville blames the Glazers
United need to stop being so tight in the transfer market and the wages they pay their superstars. Clearly not motivated 😂😂😂
Utd should play Mcguire upfront cause he’s no defender.
Ten hag please stay as your working wonders at united
4th should've stood too. Bournemouth look unbelievable this season
It could very well have been 0-5. Man United management didn't need to get to this point to know that something is terribly wrong.
Amazing performance by Bournemouth today. Dominated and had all the chances,Wasnt handball but there are no excuses. They should of had 5 or 6... Poor display by the lads today back to regualr complain settings u go Manchester United 😂😂😂
This season keeps on giving. Lots pf great games amd lots of upsets.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Great performance 👏 from Bournemouth on winning at Old Trafford for the first time in their history. As for Man United if they play like this at Anfield next Sunday, then Liverpool could do even better than the 7-0 scoreline a year or so ago. Could Liverpool score 🎼 more than seven next week against United or will Man United surprise us all and maybe nick a draw. Me personally I think Liverpool will win comfortably again after today's performances. Ah well.
Onana is shite
That 4th goal should of stood 😡
Erik Ten Hag IN Back the manager! He needs time.....            Time to get Man Utd relegated
Well didn’t see that coming , 🙄😂😂😂😂
The Man Utd we rival fans love is back 🤗😂
I’m Chelsea fan I’m so happy 😅
Come on Cherries!!!!
I blame Pogba
I swear my receding hair line is down to Man Utd
Hojlund is now 12 games 0 G/As
go on harry lad 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 utter rubbish
Man U get battered everywhere they go 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Manager of the month & sacked a week later 🤞🤞🤞
Maguire and Ten Hag player and manager of the month!😂😂😂😂
Since his arrival I have been saying ETH is rubbish.
When the best United highlight is a Maguire header, it pretty much sums up how out of depth Ten Haag is
Could’ve been 5 or 6-0 😂
Ten haag out
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Should be 4-0 can’t help it and he’s tumbling
As a Man Utd Fan this is really frustrating
Bye bye ten hag 😂😂
Thank you Bournemouth, you’ve made my day 🎉 0:23
Imagine Mark goldbridges reaction to this😂
THE DUTCH 🇳🇱 IAN HOLLOWAY , all hail Ten haag
Amrabat might be the slowest player ever seen
Man united and spurs stuck forever in the banter era
Ole in
Bruno Fernandes should play in division 2
Nice to see the small teams beating man utd's millionaires
R.i.p united on Tuesday night 😂
Thought they were title contenders after beating Chelsea 😂
Hilarious
Funny you lose 3-0 to Bournemouth, I swear Liverpool thrashed Bournemouth 9-0 🤭. Don't sweat it guys some clubs are just better than others...
So It Happened Again... /MUG/ bros I...
❤🖤
Harry Maguire 😂
Man Utd are the gift that keeps on giving I cannot wait for them to go to Anfield  🤣🤣🤣
None of us were stunned.
I've no idea why Armabat went to such mid team
Not really surprised anymore… we’ve got the exact same players starting who aren’t good enough season after season, Harry, dalot, McTominay, lindolf, awb, martial, and then add the Bang average players we’ve signed in Antony, onana, ruguilon… who couldn’t even get in the spurs team, heck even rashford has been hot and cold since his debut… the players are just not simply good enough
This shows how bad the Chelsea team is....
horrendous result for Manchester United but well done bournemouth they deserved it
😂😂😂😂 the gift that keep on giving
Don't even wanna support them bad lot. Bring back Alex fraugson
As a football fan, this is honestly so sad at this point
Im a united fan but that 4th goal shouldn't of been overturned VAR is dreadful
Time for a laugh 😂😂😢brilliant
Man Utd’s Season is going from BAD to Very BAD! The Gaffer should be watching his phone waiting for that call from Head Office which will be sooner than later if Utd keep getting these results!🤦🏾
This club never fails do disappoint pish take 😡😡 glazers out!!!!!!
Fabulous, Fantastic, FENOMENAL (PH), FLIPPING awesome, best "WORST" UTD TEAM IN HISTORY!!!! VERY WELL DONE TO BOURNEMOUTH, THOROUGHLY DESERVED, AND FERNANDES BOOKED SO MISSES LIVERPOOL HAMMERING!!!! START PACKING BOSS.
HA ! HA! HA !
Bournemouth played football man utd were in the stands, absolutely amazing by the cherries man utd fan here🎉
Bournemouth did very well Man-United fans must be devastated
KG said it would be 3-0 to Manu 😂😂😂😂  Where is his video now lol
HAHAHAHAHAHA
At this point can we keep using the word "stun" when talking about Man United loses? It is pretty much expected by now on a 50/50 ratio.
This is the BEST DAY EVER OMG 🥳
Bournemouth only had 30% possession and 4 shots on target but made it count. Super efficient, they played very well today.
Manager of the month delivers again
Can't wait for Liverpool. 😂
Inject it into my veins
BOURNEMOUTH ARE THE BEST EVERYONE THINKING WE GOING DOWN 😂😂😂😂 RED ARMY UP THE CHERRIES GARY ONIEL ISNT GOOD ENOUGH WE WENT HIGHER NOW PUSHING FOR EUROPEAN PLACE ❤😊
Joke of a club
Never hand ball for the fourth...Deserved win.
Solanke really has been a long-term investment. A few years ago, people laughed when he cost 20 mil.
Nothing impressive about beating a small team
Stunned every week, genuinely shocked lol 😂😂😂
Tenhaag surely gotta go
I blame Ronaldo for not closing the opponents down enough
Gary naviel is fear come true 😂
Ten hag breaking all the records 😂😂😂 🤦‍♂️
I’ve been a Utd fan since the 90’s and I’ve genuinely never seen such a deflated, uninterested set of individuals play for this club. Many a times we’ve blamed the owners, the managers, then not having the right players in certain positions etc. now I’ve realised it’s just changing of the times….I see the hunger, passion and desire in teams like Brighton, Newcastle and recently Villa that I used to see in my club and none of those teams had to spend excessive millions on players! Embarrassed isn’t the word, just disappointed really, they need that spark back. ETH really has work on his hands bcos unfortunately, it’s not a problem money can solve as Chelsea has clearly demonstrated 🤷🏾‍♂️
Manager needs to be sacked after such a poor result.  Only beating that Man Utd 3-0 is not good enough.
Bournemouth absolutely battered them.
Player of the month & manager of the month guys 🤦🏾‍♂️
Cannot really say I’m that stunned to be honest..
United are the gift that just keeps on giving 😂😂😂😂
Sing it with me Old Trafford is falling down, falling down, falling down Old Trafford is falling down  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
For any non BiG SiX fan seeing their own team win today this is just Christmas Dinner with extra gravy. Can't wait to see OTT reaction and indignnation from desktop authoritarians on how it went 😂
Ain't no way
We got Bournemouth be United before GTA 6
Not even the top experts can understand man united. How can a team play so differently from game to game. Baffling
Ex Liverpool player; what do you expect?
Can't wait for ETH to say we're still good and Onana is great
Imagine losing to Bournemouth 💀
Brilliant! Now, to watch the Mark goldbridge highlights! 😂
**gets ready to hear Roy Keane's analysis**
Was anyone really stunned?
Brilliant love it when the big boys lose especially Man Utd, I am a Leeds fan.
They can’t blame Onana rahsford or wan bissaka today lol
This club is becoming a disaster Ten Hag will surely get sacked😡 👇
A good 3-0 but what a ridiculous handball decision!
Manger of the month 😆
Too good.
Here's the icing on the cake 🍰
Should have been 5-0
Man u's player of the month not marking up properly.... seems right 😂
like i said all credit to bournemouth no excuses love all the abu on here the 1st thing they think about when they wake up is utd and the last thing they think about before they go to sleep is utd hated but never ignored
Can you imagine losing to Bournemouth 😂😂
And really you have to be asking yourself, where’s Paul pogba in all of this? Less worrying about the hair and more on the football
United U21s play better than this😐this team pains my existence
It just wasn't the plucky underdogs day today!
Man united hold your heads in shame. 😔
United get battered more than a of girl.
I’m confused, are Man Utd the biggest club in the world or is it Bournemouth????  Arry Maguire is the gift that keeps on giving, nearly scored a wonder goal today.
Ladies and gentlemen This is the player and manager of the month 😂😂
Onana is horrendous.
😂😂😂
No coaching no plan no creativity no goals it’s a joke a 400m joke
😂😂😂
Manager of the Month trophy came with a return envelope
how have they been stunned ? pretty much all their wins in the prem has been narrow 1-0 wins😂😂🤦‍♂️
As a Man City fan I have a lot of sympathy for United because I was a Man Utd fan until a few seasons ago
This breed of ManU players are a joke. Not that I care as an Arsenal fan but they used to be quite a worthy opponent. Not anymore.
💀💀💀💀
The Man Utd we have all missed.
Worst United team I've ever watched
Man Utd no longer a big club
And I thought maguire was good
Ha Ha Ha. Can't believe Man Utd fans actually said 'Waaaay' to the disallowed goal at the end as if it actually meant anything to them🤣
Awesome stuff Great Win for Bournemouth beat the Lacklustre Manchester United
Guess who's getting sacked in the morning?
Maguire may actually be the worst player of all time
Just as embarrassing for Chelsea, than it is for utd.
Ladies of Manchester, it might be an idea to sleep at friend's home tonight. Stay safe.
As a Chez fan, this is almost surreal to see. Could and should have been six and that would have been fair. Did that last goal really hit Ouattara on the arm??
Ronaldo, Varane, Casemiro,  Sancho are the problem 🤣... United fans deserve this for backing their manager blindly when Ronaldo a club legend was kicked out of the club. To those of you said he wasn't performing, he only started 3 EPL games last season and in the only other game where he got decent pitch time vs Everton he scored. They made no progress last season, it was only the underperformance of Liverpool that resulted in them finishing in the Top 4.
Came here to say. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well done Bournemouth!!!
Ten Hag has lost control of the squad. Great performance by the Cherries. Well deserved win.
100% should have been 4-0, embarssing handball decision!!
It would have been more of a STUN if United won let’s be honest 😂
Its time for big sam
Man. Utd lucky to get away with a three nil thumping. That could easily have been five and there was no handball for that disallowed fourth.
As a neutral football fan I've got to say this was glories and made my little heart warm.
I was quite critical of Bournemouth a few weeks ago but I'll admit Im eating humble pie, well done cherries
Manager of the month curse I swear!!
Ever since alex fegurson left,this  club has never been the same,it's a shame,😂
You know it’s bad when Maguire is their best player for few weeks xD
McTomminay again was awful. Like Rashford just can’t be bothered to chase the ball when giving it away.
Player of the month and manager of the month...what a load of premier league mafia is  bigger than ever. The fridge Maguire is back, shocking defending.
Era's really come to an end😂
Oh dear, the 1-0 win to Luton Town really got to their heads.
Norwich scarves at the ready
Absolutely brilliant!!! Well done Bournemouth!!! Liverpool winning and this result just made my day!!! I get as much pleasure watching United get beat as much as Liverpool winning!!!
I’d rather not watch United anymore, heck they got Bayern and Liverpool next it’s gonna be a total massacre for this rotten club 😔
Total trash 🗑 to mu
Icing on the cherries cake? Can't say I've ever heard that one before
This manager is done.
Shittest defeat for 40 years. Bournemouth are a poor team.  Sack the lot of them.
Ronaldo was the problem....
They should have had a pen if they are gonna call hand ball on last one.
Manchester United falling apart again.
I'd be surprised if he's still utd's manager by midnight 😂...... Your getting sacked in the morning 😂
When Maguire is the best player in the team you know there’s trouble
That dude that invested 1.3 billion must be regretting it. 😁
Absolutely disgusting that last goal got ruled out. Disgraceful officiating.
United in the mud 😂
Can see why southgate picks maguire pure class😅😅😅😅
Could of been 5-0
Thats the united I know 😂
I’m not suprised at all United don’t deserve to be in a premier league!
Go  liverpool    &  MOHAMMED SALAH   again     &  QUADRUPLE   trophies  begins  or finally.
No longer surprised to see Man Utd get smashed by a less reputable team.
Get yourself a new goalkeeper  hopeless. 😅
shoulda been 0-4.... bad decision, i know the rules but come on.... also seeing this makes me cry even more as a chelsea fan....
As a Liverpool supporter, I’d normally laugh at Utd, so… 😂😂
Onana needs to go *FULL STOP*
Great performance by Bournemouth as for United they’re back to their best 😂
How bad of a Team is a Chelsea that they got dominated by this United Team😂
Is Martial one of the luckiest prem players ever? Been at MUtd years and years, on 150k a week and still gets a game every now and then. He is abysmal
Man U has been sack manager......and is set to replace him with Ziian Aldeen Zedan.        .  ............              ..................                                                                                                                                                                                 .....
The match that lost me 100£
We all love a good old chuckle at Man United the so called "Biggest Club" in the Premier League, excellent stuff 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I've lost all faith in man u from that 7-0 ! Game we will never be the same ggmu!😢
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ten Hag IN
Mcguire was at fault for all the goals. Why is that big fridge still in the club is beyond sickening ETH needs to be sacked nowbad choice of transfers and bad choice of starting 11 absolutely way out his depth
This must be the glazers fault, surely for spending all that money on bang average, over rated players on huge wages - wait for it from the usual sources. Call out the darling players, nah.
Manchester United, the gift that keeps on giving 🤣🤣🤣
Harry Maguire back to playing as if his pants are on fire after a slight dip in slapstick the past few weeks.  He's back on it now ...
Ten Hag masterclass 😆😆
Can someone please explain to me how Martial gets to start this game? It’s becoming a mystery of the universe.
Yep, truly the theatre of dreams.
The media redemption arc for Maguire did not last long 😂
Man U still need to be Better, well Done Bournemouth
Wasn’t a handball tho couldn’t control that
Can't wait to see what Neville and Keane have to say.😅😅
well done bournemouth great tactics from manager great performance from players well deserved no excuses mufc
fair enough Bournemouth, but that Man Utd midfield is shocking lol
😂 man united the gift that keeps on giving 😂
You mean the treble accomplished club…best manager, goal and player
Comedy gold
Go  Luton  &, villa next..  please  or  pretty please.
Iraola HOOO IRAOLA Drinks estrella Eats paella Hates the scummers
Why did he play Luke Shaw as a central defender why we have like 3 central defenders on the bench ?
Irish guy was right about Bournemouth manager😮
Loving this as a Chelsea supporter.. roll on Everton to pump us
Unreal game of football. Worst United in the world.
Luke Shaw at CB 😂 congratulations ten hag
Do Utd have defenders or what?
Man utds next prem match- Liverpool at anfield xD This will be the most watched prem match this season i can bet
Player of the month, Manager of the month etc. 😂😂😂😂😂
😂
Manager of the month really showed his class today
10 minutes gang
Agent Harry strikes again. Keep going mate.
Amrabat is horrible bro 💀
Lololololololol 😂
Should have been 4, as if that really should be given as handball, off his body and onto the hand.
Martial is truly the worst player in the premier league. It is a crime he still plays for Utd.
Shocking that 4th goal was disallowed. Player was tripped and trying to stay up!!
Haha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Maguire 2/10 AGAIN 😂
“Icing on the cherries cake”. WTH 🤦🏻‍♂️
Man United falling apart again
Billion pounds
What
Player of the month my foot
Another classic in the theatre of howlers.
Turns out Old Trafford is the New Emptihad
Man Utd… the club no body fears 😂
How was that a handball? VAR literally can’t help but spoil a game unluckily their incompetence didn’t affect the result
Maguire was all over the place lol..... Bin Bag Manager of the months.... You couldn't make it up!!!
3rd NO GOAL, Keepers Had No View cos player was in front of him, FA Rules are a JOKE
I'm convinced that everytime Manure get a victory, it's nothing more than a fluke hahaha
How are Man Utd this bad?
Can't wait to see what Gary Neville has to say about this on the Gary Neville podcast; staring Garry Neville
Annually   sacking begins?   Or ole Marches on.
so bad
Whitewash
When you keep riding your luck and eventually your luck runs out, this is what it looks like, the Bournemouth manager has taken a few months but he has finally got his team to play his style of football , a few months, a few months , what Man Utd have as a coach is  a fraud
Rashford did more running today than he has for 3 months, Bruno isn’t a captain, genuinely would rather see shaw or Maguire again, honest to god that man isn’t captain worthy.  As a fan, this side is so inconsistent, how can mctominay play so well and get backed so much, and then be absolutely woeful.
I love a mid table battle
Manchester united losing to championship teams now💀
Feel bad for harry especially after the pass from amrabat
First match I search for this weekend man United I know we all was 😂
Bournemouth "STUN" Man United. The commentator sounds as though Bournemouth are playing Real Madrid. Stunned? I don't think we're really that stunned are we? Sky Sports need to get their heads out of 1999. They are about as in the past, as United themselves. This isn't a one off win against the old Man United under Ferguson...this is something we're quite used to seeing now. So some more respect shown towards the clubs that take points from United, and a bit less delusion over the mediocre club that United are today wouldn't go a miss.
Even var couldnt stop man utd from losing
Bournemouth beat Man Utd 3-0 at old Trafford and I’m not remotely suprised, didn’t think I’d say that 20 years ago!
Good night, Ten Haag! And take Onana with you.
where's that big smoke mufc guy now?!?!
Unless villa batter arsenal, i want this to be first on motd
Normal service resumed at man u
United got slapped
Two terrible terrible teams battling it out 😂😂😂
Go   Luton  &   villa  too.  Pretty please..
United players have downed tools again on another manager.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is literally the level Utd have been playing at all season, its a complete freak that they arent in 14th place on the table.
As a liverpool fan, we had this pain last season it was truly a long and painful way to watch our team suffer easy losses.
Hojlund really isnt a prem player 😂😂
All the rewards last Month 😂😂😂😂😂
Can we now please realise Maguire isnt a premier league level player. His positioning for a defender is poor and he cant read the game
United fans have little to say
Manchester United fans realising Bayern and Liverpool are up next: 💀
Onana is hopeless at this point I doubt he could catch a cold 🤦🏻‍♂️
People will all talk about how shocking Man United were   Let’s talk about how good the cherries were IRAOLA IRAOLA
As a Chelsea fan, It's so frustrating to watch us go toe to toe with City and Arsenal only to let this dogshit United side turn us over.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Get the Norwich scarfs out boys.
worst match seen by man utd  so far
Go  Luton   tomorrow  too  please   against   city's  too.
Liverpool next ahh  Ten could be next week
Man united back to their best😂😂
Has there ever been a sacked MOTM 😂
😂
You can hear Goldbridge crying as every Bournemouth goal goes in.
Sacked in the morning.
Hahaha was nice to see empty seats at Old trafford 🤣🤣🤣
Why in the name of all that's holy, is ten hag playing martial?...  We played first half with 10 men because of that...
That keeper is a total lump of dogshit.......hahahahahahaaaaaa!!!
Klopp to see off another Utd 'saviour' next week???
Pmsl United are a comedy club. Hoyjlund 72 million and absolute garbage. Another martial type player.
I'm an arsenal fan and obviously don't like Man Utd but in all honesty, that current team is just a disgrace, in all 3 goals those players just look so unbothered  and unfortunately yet ANOTHER manager is gonna go down for it.
Over the top reaction by United fans on beating Chelsea instead of our bad Chelsea were with missed chances
I would say horrible defending but there is literally no defence… they’re all watching the ball and Onana is just terrible overall, his dives always have unnecessary extra sauce on them and he never seems to be anywhere near the ball
Bayern at home and Liverpool away next...
Bournemouth played good today, deserved the win
POTM Maguire 😮‍💨
Ten Hag out. Sancho in lol
I can t believe someone is paying that bald coach millions of £ x year. Absolutely unbelievable.
Ha Ha Ha.. Manuare O Bournemouth boys 3.. Well done.
Man united title charge lasted 3 days 😅😂😅
Ah unlucky lads better luck next time hahahhaa.
ERIC'S AT THE WHEEL.
The curse of the manager of the month award
Some utd fan need liverpool match to be postp what now
United keep getting better 😂😂😂
1 season united are very good, 1 season they play like garbage😂
😂😂😂
Last goal shouldn't have been disallowed or should have been a penalty at the very least. He got tackled by the gk, thus the "handball"
How does martial keep getting picked to start and how is he still rinsing the club after so many years Utd are a daft club
They need to stop offering the same players contract renewals some have been there almost ten years and they haven’t worked out at all. How martial is even at the club is beyond me about as threatening as a cushion in front of goal
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha beat at home to Bournemouth 3 nil stuff of nightmares🤣🤣🤣🤣
Glory Glory Man Utd 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Maguire the worst player iv ever seen play for man u... how is he still picked??? Man u should employ roy keane who's only job is if a player don't give 100% he sacks them on the spot!!
The gift that keeps on giving
Annual   sacking  begins?     Or ole  Marches on
People keep saying back ten hag but U spend money on 2out of the 3 forwards and your goal return is worse than teams fighting relegation  you sign whole New midfield and no combo works U leave a word class defender on the bench Dutch league level not premier league  some players need to be sold but manager need to go as well
Absolutely class from Bournemouth 😮🍒
fair play good game! Just wish we could see the underdog win for once!
Can't play Chelsea every week.
Sorry it wasn’t deliberate handball goal should stood
If only Bournemouth’s 4th goal stood💀
hahahahaha united in the mud 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can I just remind United fans of who they have next, a must win game Vs Munich & a date with 7-0 Liverpool at anfield no pressure
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
United terrible defence needs to be studied
Club that wins player of the month, manager of the month and goal of the month everybody!  Last month tho.
That Chelsea win was an illusion.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂    or  ole  Marches on
I thought Utd fans said they were back. Priceless. Christmas has arrived early.
“(It) can’t just be one game where we need to show a reaction. It has to come out and show that every week.” - McTominay post-Chelsea interview. C’mon Scotty, we need consistency🤦‍♂️
How can that be handball ?!
Bournemouth were just too clinical today 👏
Best result ever hah
Only people who would be stunned by this result are people who haven't been watching football lately. Lazzzyy lazy man utdddddd...lazzzzy lazy man utddddd..watch the rest go marching on on on!!
Goldbridge highlights should be good this week
hahahahahahahahahahah
Bournemouth didn’t STUN United, it was completely expected. It’s what United do these days.
worst defending ive ever witnessed
anyone surprised?
Of course Rashford was running like he had three lungs when the game was done when he hasnt over the last 3 months😂
😂😂😂😂
Manager and player of the month btw
LOOLLLL MAN UTD ARE ABSOLUTELY SHITEEEE
what is wrong with united
What a performance for Bournemouth, they look like a new side, Everton as well.
Man Utd lost their fear factor a long time ago. If we are getting battered 3-0 by Bournemouth imagine what Bayern and Liverpool would do to us.
United have been playing for the last decade like they're been literally stunned
Maguire back and making the difference.... Love to see it
shambolic performance, the players simply are disgraceful and deseve the fans or the club
Love United being saved by the refs but still getting smashed by Bournemouth 3-0 😅 Bruno should’ve been sent off again but nothing happens…
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ha ha take that man united that’s what you get for beating chelsea backfired
What happened the manager of the month and player of the month? 😂😂
United fans remember when you were telling us liverpool fans to mind the gap?? The gap moved back to manchester lads, im loving every second of your demise 🤣🤣🤣
not only was de gea's distribution at fault for the first, sancho didnt press for the second, and varane made a mistake for the third. i can see why ten hag dropped them now as the team play so much better without them.
Player of the month was brilliant today showing us all why he deserves that award
Wahahahahaha
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.....🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Never change United, never change 🩵
No Sancho, No cristiano Ronaldo…Who’s the coach going to put the blame on now
Ha as a liverpool fan this is hilarious
insanity is classed as doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results, so why on earth is Martial allowed anywhere near the pitch? Should've been offloaded years ago but for some reason he keeps playing. Onana is an absolute calamity too
Old Trafford is falling down!!  Surely Ten Hags time is up now!
Everyone will talk about United but let’s give credit to Bournemouth a famous win for them & with luton & forest next they’re unbeaten in 5 (4w/1D)
you know it's bad when on the 9th of December 2023, Boremouth became the biggest club in Manchester.
Eriks at the wheel! 😂
Loooool
Minute silence for Man Utd please 😂
BWHAHAHAH HA HAH AHAH HAHAAAAA Man U are so sh!t it's unbelievable. 😂
In 7 Hag we trust!
Remember,  this is all cr7 to blame and .an United new manager is extremely good
Red army amazing win should have been  4 ❤
🤣🤣🤣
This is the best Man Utd performance since last week 😅
Things you love to see
This is the Man United we all know and love 🤣🤣
Well deserved Tbf 😊
😂😂😂
As a United fan i say we need to persevere with ETH. All right thinking United fans agree.
It's remarkable how bad that group of Man U players are.. For the money they're on to turn up and give that performance is shocking. Fair play to Bournemouth, proper team and actually all look like they're bothered!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Premier League Manager of the Month this season has been a joke, Ange in 5th with 3 awards, Ten hag in 6th with 1, meanwhile Arteta, Klopp and Emery get nothing.
the theatre of dreams for other teams, the theatre of nightmares for manchester united...
Maguire fresh off his player of the month fails to tightly mark the only opposition player in his box from the get go. Typical Utd.
They got pumped by Bournemouth 😂👍
This is a thrashing. Ten Haag won’t last.
Ten Haag doing a great job! Keep it up!
i had a feeling keeping solanke in my fpl would do me well
You love to see it!
Imagine getting torn apart by solanke 😂 guys this isn’t funny anymore
Come on united we need are spark back
Full credit to Bournemouth! They were lucky phenomenal today. Ten Haag really under pressure now!!
Liverpool will win 8-0 in a weeks time , not to mention what will happen in mid week against Bayern 😮 it’s peak for United !
ItS AlL tHe GlAZeRs FaUlT
Manchester United been getting “STUNNED” for the past 10 years now
I always love it when small pub sides beat big teams, but unfortunately Man Utd lost to Bornemouth today...
Best 10 years ever just keeps getting better and more satisfying!!
When Shaw plays lb we play good But when don't play lb we play bad
The worst Utd team of all time. Forget about the 70s
Man Utd are the gift that keeps on giving
Lol  Lol Lol
I have actually had enough of these players giving up
chelsea make any team look good if there not on it so i expected a man u lost
Hilarious 😊🤣👌 well done to Bournemouth
Manchester United have sacked Manager Erik Ten Hag  , Athletico Madrid's Diego Simeone is the bookies favourite to take over !
Welcome back Manchester united
Today i was hoping an underdog would win sadly it didn’t happen today
OMG 🤯
I always like the underdog winning but sadly it wasn't today.
But i thought man utd was back? 😂😂😂
Liverpool 7-0 Manchester United incoming...
Funny how it could’ve been wayyy more for Bournemouth 😂😂
All of the comment section dont understand Its the glazers fault
A WIN VS CHELSEA AND THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA GO ON A QUADRUPLE CHARGE JUST TO GET DUNKED ON BY A CHELSEA ACADEMY PRODUCT LOOOOL
Almost time to get the Norwich scarfs out boys. See if you can get the Liverpool game postponed again 😂
Old Trafford - the theatre of dreams, for any team that plays Man Utd there...
player of the month, manager of the month, goal of the month... then 0-3.
Imagine showing this to a United fan 15 years ago
“Eras can end” -3 goal difference MANCHESTER UNITED. Joke of a club for the last few years
It really is sad. I guess the underdogs don’t always get the win.
🍒🍒🍒
OUT worked  OUT muscled  OUT coached  GLAZERS OUT
Bruno out
😂😂😂😂😂😂
All the people who only watch premier league games told me Iraola wasn’t good…
I know we like to see the underdogs win but unfortunately it wasn’t meant to be today.
Let's all laugh at man utd 😂😂😂😂
Well done Bournemouth .  I was talking about this the other day as a neutral , they will get a superb win and play well but revert to performances like today and Newcastle .  ‘United are like a bag of revels , you never know what you’re going to get ‘
Wow o can’t believe they won
I know there will be lots of underdog jokes today
Utd are the new Liverpool of the old 😂
Solanke was absolutely brilliant today !
I didn’t expect 3-0 to Bournemouth
The underdog couldnt win today unfortunately
Can we take a moment of silence for the Man Utd supporters thinking they were back after beating Chelsea?
First
I should of put a bet on that United loose the money I could be making lol
Manager of the month, player of the month & they celebrate it by losing 3-0 at home to Bournemouth 😂 Bayern & Liverpool next 😂
“Get the Norwich scarves”
And they thought Yanited are back😭😭
The Match we’ve all been waiting on 😂
Well now that man u have got the hard one out of the way, they can concentrate on Bayern and Liverpool 😂
😢😢
How did they STUN United when anyone can beat United
Beautiful
Another Utd Failure 🤣🤣🤣
Poor
If Man Utd are losing 3-0 to Bournemouth at home imagine what the score will be like at Anfield
The two Manchester clubs getting humbled 😂
United doing united thing 🥲
At this point I m done! This club is finished! How come we beat Chelsea at home and then lose to Bournemouth 3-0 at home! 😭😭😭😭😭
Chelsea really made them believe they are better then they actually play, even Ten Hag’s good results have come in stressful games..
Garry Neville is spewing fire today 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Man U joke of a club the fans thought they were back after beating one of the worst Chelsea sides in premier league history lol joke owners joke manger joke players and joke fans lol banter club 😂
Just give Bournemouth the 4th goal as a Christmas present 🎁 lol😂
rip man u
Most Manchester United performance ever
Instead of laughing at utd in the comments how bout give iraola his flowers
After that 6-1 loss vs city their manager was on verge of sack but he took that personally & has transformed the side recently - luton & forest next
Plenty of us United Supporters did think (unfortunately) it was a house of cards.
UP THE CHERRIES 🍒
Man utd at it again
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Putting 'STUN' in the title is harsh on Bournemouth
lol
WHO WANTS TEN HAG TO STAY? 😂😂😂
Manager of the month curse is crazy
Famous win for cherries who after losing 6-1 to city have now won 4 of last 5 games (drawing the other) level on pts with Chelsea in 10th
Lol
😂😂😂😂😂
Poor defending again from avram glazer at the back post
LFC ON TOP MAN UNITED DOWN
Ten hag manager of the month ? 😂😂😂
Let’s all laugh at man utd😊
1st
