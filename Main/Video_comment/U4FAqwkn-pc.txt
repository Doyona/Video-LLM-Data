♥️♥️♥️♥️ you will always be missed, you changed the game for the better and 43ver.  #KB43VER
Even as a 50yo man this video almost brings me to tears, I'm by far not the emotional type, but even guys my age, Ken Block was a huge influence in my life, from the cars I drive, to me even getting into the hill climb events, which is absolutely a blast & 2026 will be my first year competing, should have enough practice from The Dragons Tail & driving America's Nurburgring, Geiger Grade Rd here in Reno Nevada, where they have the Virginia City Hill Climb Event every summer, gonna even try my hardest to use #43 as a tribute & have a pretty cool wrap idea planned.   Will be doing it in an Audi S5, so was happy when Ken switched from Ford to Audi, 90% of the cars I've owned, have been Volkswagen Group, but have owned a ASC Mustang McLaren & a Ford Lightning in my past, so not a total hater on American cars...😂  R.I.P KB#43 you'll never be forgotten & have inspired an army of car fanatics that will keep pushing the boundaries in your honor!
MMMM the smell of burning rubber in the morning...
Juca en el bocho 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bad car. Much power but no sound
He made it look so easy... Cool, calm, collected. The world is missing this man. Rest in Peace, Ken.
Goonies and Hoonigans never die 😢
Oničem,ten závěr s benzíňakama to zachránil
Legendary.
Ken Block, a Dream-Driver❤❤❤❤ R.I.P. WE WILL NEVER FORGET!!!
Thought I'd enjoyed every Ken Block vid until tonight, him in electric is insane🤣🤣 man defied what 4wd is capable of and wrote a new book in the process🥰 still prefer the 65 Mustang😍 but Ken in electric, Audi should've used this as promotional video🤣🤣 sleep well brother, never forgotten🙏
We miss that guy. Got to meet him live at a Subaru dealer event. Also watch him drive a Subaru rally car at the New Zealand snowboard park. Search for it on YouTube.
I TRULY miss KB's shenanigans, and all the ultra-high octane MFn badass craziness! - - - -RIP - - - I know you are ripping it up, wherever you are now
RIP THE BEST DRIVER ALL TIME : KEN BLOCK : LEGEND.
Without the engine noise, you can hear the agony of the tires much more clearly. The torque of an electric motor is insane.
Красава
The Myth , The Legend Mr. Ken Block. What an Amazing driver. RIP buddy.
Tu nous manques KeN !
I could do better than that 😂
Я все понимаю но звук бесит где норм звук двигла на полном приводе...
WHY do we always lose the greatest first ? Yet those that govern us and make life worse seem to just go on and on 😢 RIP KEN BLOCK 🙏 ✌️🇬🇧🤝🇺🇲✌️👍
The thing that I miss is that you cant get a Ken Block anykhana, anymore.   The fact that all authoritative bodies whether they be car manufacturers, municipalities, local state federal (or international) governments ALL collaborated for this guy to bring you eye sex.
biggest respect to the driver but e-cars sound ugly. i need wrooom not iiiihihiihihihiiiiii
Rip ♥️🚗🔝
Monster

😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 tendrían que sacar una película para recordarlo😢😢
I am still in shock.  Kids, you got to be very careful on snowmobiles, they are not a joke.
RIP Big boy The sound of electric cars is just awful🤮
With or without I'll do it
How long does the battery last?

Парни уходят,тогда как им захочется. Вечная Память.

Rest in Peace, Ken Block.  I hope you are racing in heaven!
Это против субару что ли ,субару лучше!!!
Can't believe this was his last
жаль, погиб по глупости на снегоходе

this could be us but they made cars expensive af
Ken Block 🤪
How much did they pay the Cartels to shut half the city down for a few days?
RIP Legend! Still thing the Mustang is the King. This thing sounds like an R/C car.
Не не то это, не то
Forever will be missed..
The sound of this thing is amazing
die Karre ist so geil 😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤
двигун внутрішнього згорання своїм звуком добавляє кайф. електрика в цьому плані на корню убиває процес перегляду.
RIP my friend. You will forever remain the G.O.A.T of so many extraordinary extreme sports.
First time seeing this bro is casually drifting an electric car wow
This time not so interesting..😏
Thank you Ken, it's been fun watching you all these kinds of crazy stunts.
Поздрави от Словенският балкан.
I just found out that electric cars can be this great
True legend to all. There should be statues of Ken block in every country world wide .A true gent and inspiration to all
My love for rally was cemented with this guy
best to ever do it and always will be, we miss you ken. KB43VER
маньяк а не гонщик)))😎👍
you can see in his facee he does not like driving this thing
Last month, got the pleasure of seeing almost the entire Gymkhana car collection at the Petersen Automotive Museum exhibit. Truly made me appreciate all the crazy effort so many people put into these Gymkhana videos from the builders to the creators to the folks just getting the day to day done. All for the enjoyment of gearheads all over the planet. Ken definitely left his mark. So of course, that led me to binging all the videos again to relive all of them. You'll be missed, legend! Thanks for inspiring so many of us. #KB43VER
Wuau que buen video 😮❤
Hoon Responsibly.❤😢
GO BACK TO GAS/FUEL I HATE THE WIND!!!! i want to hear the gears up down shift.. the wind fucking sucks!!!! You're face says it all
Amazing! you were the man, you will be missed RIP Ken💔
the sound is so disappointing hah-aha
Done deal period

The last dance 🤍🙏
🤍👏🥇
I can't WAIT for his next one!
Block was the reason why I put rwd aside and went awd for hooning. I think i should build a rwd to honor that memory
That double reverse entry on the highway to the exit was nuts
Cazzo bellissimo il suono del motore 😢😢😢😢😢
Maybe Ken holds the world record for most burned rubber. Someone should check.
Reddit anyone?
videonun yarısı tanıtım amına sokayım

Sucesso é quando a capacidade encontra a oportunidade.
I’m sorry but electric cars totally sh%t!! No soul No emotions!!🤷‍♂️ Ken RIP with respect
LEGEND!!
I bet they went through a ton of tires on this monster
Wownster!😮
He's a legend. Face is deadpan til it gets really hairy, then just a wry smile. Bet is hr peaks at about 80 or something. Awesome 👌
Miss you ken
There is a god in this world, there will be justice for all of you, sooner or later the world will find out what you are.
RIP MISTER KEN BLOCK 😮😢❤😭
I always cry at the end
Anyone else notice the borla sponsorship sticker on a car that has no exhaust?

Literally the best to ever do it. RIP Ken
he is not as gracefull as the original
God damn best driver that ever lived...no exaggeration...miss you Ken your a fucken kegend
Was Ken supposed to tail-tap that cam? Yes.
This was when I stopped everything I had for Ken. Ripped off my hoon stickers and burned my other gear. He was a sellout money man. Not even a top 10 as for WRC.
Thank you for everything, Hoonigan. Your legacy and passion for cars will forever live in our hearts. Today we remember you with respect and admiration, sending you light and good vibes wherever you are. 🕊🕊🤍🤍
You know your special when you can get entire city blocks shut down so you can play. Best Ever R.I.P
KEN BLOCK    never dies   he is still alive in   speed lovers heart
The only smoke coming from that car is from the tires
No treads left at the end of this run 🤘🤘🤘
RIP Ken <3
holysht thats a mean mtfking machine i want more of this
Ken Block Greatest
Why is no one on the street or watching?
The sound on this car sucks. I agree, Ken Block will be missed. But having every comment being in memorial of him ruins discussion of his amazing feats. Yall need to get out of your feelings. This is not the best run of his, but it's cool he did one with an EV
Still watching this in 2025. ❤Ken we still miss you❤ can't wait to see Leah block take over the gymkhana series
Still missing you Ken):
Whatever happens i hope his daugther would open up to doing one video for her father while driving this audi
Sept. 2, 2025
Gracias Ken por regalarnos estos hermosos 💜 💕 videos¡¡¡ siempre... los miro... besos al cielo mi corazón ❤
RIP..
Rip mr block and thank you for the memories
No Rev, no flame , not much fun

I like this the driver is stunt  drift
Yakında Togg aracımızda uyarlanmış video bekliyoruz Kenblock pist lerin devi . ✋🙂
Now what about me today
Tan cerca de mi casa (10 minutos)  y me vengo enterando años después
The MASTER!   In his element.  There will never be another. He is missed.
CHAIFA? Really? that fake and that advertising? no no no
Quality content as always.
Only 1 ken block
Rip the master !
As a big fan of Keb Block and a VAG/Audi lover, this lawnmower sound has once again assured me not to buy EV. s5 b9 and q5 owner.
idk how this is the first time i'm seeing this video. but damn it hit. RIP buddy. #KB43VER
Pity he left us with an electric yoke. That ain’t motorsports to most of us 😢
🥺 for respect

This car sounds like a damn jet. Rest in paradise to the greatest that ever done it for real. Most racers start at like 12-14yrs old. Ken block started at 37yrs old man. Props to the legend man. R.I.P
How many times did you download it until the video came out!!!!hehehehe!!!!!
=((((( KEN BLOCK =((( MISS U :(((
🫶
KEn,Blocks en Paz Descanses😢❤😅
Ken is Irreplaceable.  Great Tribute on his last Hoonigan Journey, great editing on the video!  He is missed by many.  Amazing talent and focus.  AUDI must consider naming a brand after him.  Amazing S1 Hoonitron btw!  What an EV.  Was that a 70/30 split in rear or 80/20?
Rip
Не позорь наставника! То, что,ты сейчас вставляешь напоказ (усиливая звук, для эффекта) для Кена было обыденностью! И ваш этот чувачок суперпосредственный, он ничего не умеет, только позировать на камеру, не более.
Thanks Again Hoonigan !
R. I. P. 🎉 in Heaven
Miss you Legend
It took me till today to actually be able to watch this video. R.I.P Ken you will forever be missed #KB43ver

FOREVER HOOOOONENNNNNN!!!
The video looks really unrealistic when you watch it, and then there's such a shitty electrical noise.🤮🤮🤮🤮
why the wheels turn in diferents direction at the start of the video bruh
I think it's kinda cool how it sounds like an RC car.
Master ken! Pls dont make fun of a legend!!!!!!!
This man is AWESOME
Ken had his life taken away and we were robbed of future videos.

The Best of the Best! RIP Ken!
I'll never forget chatting with him many years ago at a Rally event in Cardiff, he knew a friend of mine (who owned Richard Burns's old championship integrali), he was a funny bloke and i didn't realise it was him at first. REST IN POWER
You know what baffles me most. The sheer amount of lack of coverage from American media on the days following his death. I had to find out from India and other Middle Eastern countries news.
wtf tires ?
Statek kosmiczny jaksonow 🇵🇱🇵🇱🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Rest in peace Ken, we know you're still ripping it up there, You are a legend #43, rest well
One show Man, RIP my friend.
We Miss You Ken Block😢🎉❤🚘
A true legend ❤
one of the very few people (if not the only) who could make an electric car look exciting...RIP Ken, you changed so much and had such a contribution, a GOAT hero of motorsport in the truest of senses, together with Senna and others of their caliber.
Watched about 3 seconds. Electric motors just aren't appealing.
This man will 43ver be the greatest to have ever done it. This man will be missed. Rest easy KB43. From South Africa
My god
Помним любим скорбим😢

Ken, sometimes, for a select few, the mission is to be remembered! Rest in peace! You've accomplished your mission!
What tires did you use cause.... damn!!
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition

The man's driving was amazing and I doubt anyone can match it

This video shows how to tear a vehicle to pieces in 20 minutes.
Whoever does not appreciate his swagger… does not need to be into cars and should play with barbie’s
Ken was seeing life in slow motion….this man lived in the zone. Immortal
Саша. Я обещаю.  Ты не доживешь до сорока. Люди не будут даже знать где тебя закопали
Larger than life, yet still humble as can be. Ken Block.
I miss him a lot
R.I.P. 43ver!😢 Definitely one of the GREATEST to ever do it! pure LEGEND!

ЛУЧШИЙ!
Sorry. Awesome as electric cars can be, performance wise, they are only entertaining for the drivers and not the spectators. Without the sound and smells of performance internal combustion engines there is almost nothing there for the spectators and fans to appreciate. This goes for mechanics too. Electric racing just sucks for spectators. Period!
Hoonigan? What happened to the supercalifrajalisticsppala-hooligan
Me encanta como conducía y el Mustang ❤❤❤ loco por ese choce espero que lo tenga su hija que estoy seguro que llegará tan lejos como supa
God Speed Ken. One of a kind. You are remembered.

I built a 10k sim because of Nitro circus videos ive seen as a teenager... I  grew up with wealthy kids in my school and they were purchased cars when we got lisences... I have was a few years after because we were not as fortunate but I always wished some one would give me cars to drift and pay me
Still the best to ever drive a car. Hands down
Он больше шоумен чем профи, Царь и Чепа поинтереснее будут
Wow don't let your Legend die with CGA       from the looks of it. Your kid not putting out in the work but selling out
What would you do if you were the last man on earth😂
This is what i see when i phantasize😂
Soooooo much fun to perform like that ❤
Your are still the best 😢❤😂🎉
I always thought I was driving like Ken Block until Ken Block showed us all how it's done!
That car sounded like KITT from Knight Rider. Lol.  So rad.  Such a badass driver.
How many battery charges were needed to make this video?
Wild How this was created just before his unfortunate passing and at the end of this, he said “good now we can be done”.
Вот это Ас
The car sounds shit, my battery rc cars sound better
Без Кена Блока це вже не то шоу, що раніше змушувало завмирати подих і зупиняло серце, аж при перегляді пітніли лодоні.

The most popular stunt driver second to Evel Knievel
i wonder what his favorite car was..
He would have made EVs cool.
We love and miss you Ken, you will always be the greatest..
Lo curioso es que para este video no tuvieron que cerrar el CHAIFA, ese aeropuerto siempre esta solo 🤣🤣
Borla exhaust on the electric car. I like it! :D
This man, is the reason I’m into cars and racing games, we all miss you Ken.
God bless his soul ❤.

Liking the sound of the engine. What engine is it?
Thanks for everything Ken Block’s.
The epic of the Legend, and what a beast he was!
RIP legend 🙏🏼.
I’m totally not holding back tears after that compilation at the end 😅
Cuanto duran esas ruedas.
Definitely miss Ken's Driving. Forever in our hearts.  Curious question, would Lia ever be aloud to try out the Audi Electrikana car?
This is IA, right ?
No one else finds it eerie that this is titled "One Last Playground"?? Was it released after his passing? I'm genuinely curious. Regardless, RIP Ken Block. #LegendsNeverDie
Todo un espectáculo y una obra maestra , lo que dejo este hombre!!!
should have stuck with FORD not some junk E audi
Miss you legend 😢❤

I just decided to watch this now because I know it's the last one. Been a fan since the very first one.. so sad and bittersweet. End of the last great car era. Rip to Ken and my childlike automotive enthusiasm. Hoonigan back in the daily transmission early days was great too. So much good car content. Nice to be a fan of all this.
The sound of an rc car doesn't do anything for me. It should have a 5 cylinder turbo
Simply the best he didn't drive the car he became the car god bless you ken🙏
La berno. Y la soto.. California..  Kenworth. Culpable. Troke
Великий пилот авто, смотришь и не верится что Кена больше нет, помним тебя Кен....
KEN BLOCK was the best..i love all Hoonigan Stuff, but this video is wack..i missed the sound of an overtuned V8..REAL POWER..sry
💓Ken sure could drive the snot outta those machines.  He did some seriously amazing things in Rally and Drift. Definitely left his mark on the racing world💓
❤
7:18 - The switch from Drive to Reverse and then back to Drive was mental 😵🤯, omg that was so dope 😂🔥 RIP KB43VER
f ken
RIP legend
At least...he drove a drone.
RIP🕊️
Icredibile😮
Viva México y la Leyenda 🇲🇽🔥❤️🙏💎
And to think people back when I was a kid used to complain that electric cars were gonna ruin racing and enthusiast culture. Thanks, Ken, for being one of the real ones, and goating out that vehicle to be able to perform how it does. Incredible. You will be missed, man <3
Кен лучий
How did they get it to where there was not one car on the streets he was at in such a big city. It literally looked like a ghost town.
Rip Ken! You inspired a lot of people in the car community and drifters alike,
2:19-2:21 kiss that GoPro goodbye
Miss you Ken!!
How a star sounds is still being understood in the sky's of stars.... he will always be a star for ppl to look apon
Sounds for his daughter will be different one day. Respect 🙏
The king .
Inspiringly precise and robust vehicle
Ode to Ken... always the beast! If u see this ...imagine his love and pov in life.... so F IN BEAUTIFUL!! Alaways #43
Rip big dog!
How much hp?
From the humble beginnings of a gamer to an absolute legend rest in peace ❤
Ken Block człowiek z pasją i zamiłowaniem do prędkości. Podobnie jak Schumacher zapłacił najwyższą cenę za spełnienie marzeń.  Będziemy pamiętać -  RIP .

I don't know why but watching this it feels like Kens time was already up, something is different and it's really weird thinking and typing this. Rip to the legend
Fly high Ken, you were the one that got me into rallying and drifting🎉🎉
Will never forget him. His Gymkhana 9 was filmed in my hometown of Buffalo, NY.
He's a sadly 😥 missing legend
神様
He was definitely absolutely amazing 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Gracias por ese último maravilloso drift en el Aeropuerto Internacional Felipe Ángeles de la ciudad de México 😊😊😊
The loudest electric car ever seen
Легенда!
Вже відомо точно що весь топлівний транспорт скотінамобіль
RIP Ken Block
Ken Block pra sempre será lembrado era o melhor de todos os tempos junto com o Senna #KB43VER
Lets see it compete in a 24hr le mans, lol the thing will be on charge for half the day :D
Ken set the bar so high, there isn't gonna be another Ken Block in our lifetime or ever.
*Honestly, it sounds like sh1t.*
The planet is a far worse place without Ken
Rest in paradise, legends never die 💯
ken cool. electric cars not. this sounds as exciting as a refrigerator turning on after you open the door. appreciate the effort to make electric cars cool. its just not gonna happen for me though. sound is a must.
was too short but full throttle!  such a talented driver!
only ken can make electric cars seems cool
#Hoonigan
God dude I miss Ken.. I got to meet him one time and it was like being in the presence of Zeus himself it was awesome. What a legend, and truly an inspiration for myself as well as millions of other car nerds around the world. Godspeed Ken, hope they let you bring your mustang in hooniheaven brother!!!
the car scene definitely lost a legend. RIP KB.
some say at least he died doing what he loved... yep falling 300ft onto rocks crumbling his bones at speeds faster than terminal velocity, may god rest your soul
Bu arabayı kullanan katıksız o.ç  tebrikler
Well... I got to 1:39 before that stupid sound of the car killed it for me. I'm sure the driving was bad ass but...  Electric cars are stupid AF!
Así juego Need for Speed Heat, me lo pasé en 8 días
Rest in peace Legend Ken Block 43😢
Ken Block, never to be forgotten. R.I.P.
I miss Ken and his videos what a shame what happened 😢
Huh, maybe electric cars aren't the end of the world...
Looks like he’s driving in the city able
Yo estuve en el equipo de producción de este trabajo fue muy emocionante y varis días
43 4 ever....the best
so much rubber was burned, it's absolutely not environmentally friendly
I can’t believe it’s been almost two years already!.. What a freaking legend tho man!! Rip Ken.. 😔🙏🏼
6:06: What the fuck flew from the care there??? Was it important?
what a legend
I remember when he bet Rob ownership of DC that couldn't punt basketball 40 plus yards and make it. Rob shook his hand and booted that bxtch😂. Swish. Ken laughed it off. Remain head at DC😅
Без двс это как секс в резинке
Царство небесное, кену блоку
It's the best ninja in the car  "machines" Nice number 1
Defenetly we all miss you KB so much... Rest In Peace "Big Brother"..
Can anyone please explain how the front tires are rotating in the clockwise direction and the rear tires are rotating in the anti-clockwise direction at the same point of time in the beginning of the video?
пилот хорош машина классная. но скучно
I realy feel bad about his DESTINY.Rest in peace KEN
Forever miss Ken Block. What a legend. He got so many people hooked onto something I’d never seen or thought possible. One of the most entertaining and naturally gifted drivers ever. Thank you for all the incredibly awesome memories. ❤🇺🇸

How to get out of becoming crippled? You hit a "perfect mark." The opposite of Rob D's fantasy Factory logo of a man falling on his face.

2024, It still hurts to watch this video and know that at this point the whole Ken Block phenomenon started at an airport and ended at an airport. Excelsior! I have nothing more to say than thanks to Ken Block I love motorsports

RIP You where and always will be the greatest. Due to your driving I remembered something that you told your daughter. I used that one day when it was raining very hard and a car had lost control and broke it's sump sending oil all over the road. This caused me spin out. Thanks to you even though you are not with us you saved my life RIP thanks. I did 2  360 spins and due to you I was able to correct it and come out facing the right way the police man who saw what happened. Just said to me after I told him how I was able to do it. He said sir you learned from the world's greatest. Thank God bless you and your family ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉

Lol the guy sucked at driving.... I don't understand why people were thinking he was any good. 😂😂😂😂😂
It’s crazy that god decided to end Ken Block’s life without letting Ken to finish his project… damn.. he really have hope in that project in future where he no longer with us.. so sad
😢
✅💯
Awesome talent.
In an absolute true gentleman can only imagine being in a car with him once would have been better than going on a rocket ship.
How many "would" say.  Probably the best driver on the planet at the time?
Yep great tire sponsor amazing how he could control the vehicle even on ice God Bless ❤
electric car  noise enoying the rest awwwweseome
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Кен, какого ты сдох а? Что тебе дома плохо?  Чтоб слышал скотина - какого .... ты расколотился? в опу электрички, букашку форд кто вернёт, айертон с хондой или мишка с фолмастером?!!! оба 3.
Ken block el mejor y su super producción una pena que se aya ido 😢
As an italian, Ken was what Valentino Rossi was to us AND MotoGP as a whole. May he rest in heaven.
ケンブロック！あなたは私たちの心の中に生き続けています！！感動と興奮をありがとう！！日本より🇯🇵
Will never forget the first time I saw Ken Block in a video with the 1st gen Hoonicorn. I was in shock and disbelief! It's been a wonderful ride!! You are missed, Ken Block!!!! #43 FOREVER!!!!!
Electric isn’t the same
Фиеста рулит🎉🎉🎉❤

What a man - father - husband & driver & a massive talent - RIP my man
Ken Block ,Colin McCrae, Michael Schumacher, Tommi Makinen ,Senna,Lewis Hamilton, these men made vehicles extensions of their bodies the drove vehicles better than most of walk LEGENDS AND G O A T S IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
Omg Mexico Airport looks like gta
SAVAAAJE
Rest in peace to the greatest.
Ken Block, a true poet behind the wheel. Damn....  But, I will say that this is pretty much what my drive to and from the gym looks like, every morning...!
My goodness it's like a full scale brushless r/c car.
We got an eletric car with handbrake before GTA6.
respect to the goat, but man....that electric car sounds rough.
Motor elétrico 😢 Perdeu-se a magia do ronco carburado 😟
Great Show
Honestly put off watching this till now cause of reasons than he passed and it kinda hits deep he wasn't in hoonicorn
#KB43VER ✌🏼
absolute legend.  watching this gave me chills. He will be missed RIP Ken
😢😢😢😮
南無　🧐🥺🥶
I prefer ken when he worked for ford. This seems forced and just an advert for European EVs
Con razón, hay nubes en el cielo, es Ken Block derrapando...😅😅😂
❤❤❤❤❤
its been 2-1 year since ken died. you will be missed bro. u have inspired generations. we miss you. ken block 1967-2023
Praise be to God  Jesus saves
Satanic energy drink taking over Sports
Man sounds just like my team associated tc4 brushless rc car from back in the day. Lol.
Бля это звук взлетающего или садящегося. Круче ничиго не слышал 🎉
Вазик'_(😊
Rip Ken, And rip hoonigan, you will never be the same since he passed
Great Video no question, but 😮 I miss the sound of a big audi motor, this unbelievable roaring 😁
Really weird watching electric cars. I got about 20 seconds in and had to mute it, as just type screaching noise is annoying, but the video was cool. Maybe do a sound over with actual exhaust noise to make it a perfect video.
Elektrikli süpürge😂
Damn i miss that dude❤
KB43 will forever live on in motorsports history for the pure skill, talent and dedication he had to his craft. We will forever remember the legend that is Ken Block
*R.I.P to the GOAT OG*
❤The Silent Cockpit. Brilliant
RIP ken.........
I almost started crying watching this, we should be grateful we've been able to see his last drive
Без звука двигателя......... ЭТО УЖАС. ДОСМАТРИВАТЬ НЕ СТАЛ😢
It really doesn't get any easier knowing he's gone. That first Climbkhana is still one of my favorite things, just because of how over built the Hoonicorn is. Also, just some beautiful driving through a scenic environment. We still miss you Ken.

Miss Ken block... taken way to early.  That car however could disappear anytime... where's the rumble, the flames!!!... sounds like a giant remote controlled car.  No thanks, great film, and amazing driver... need more turbos...lol
gone way to soon.
One of a kind guy. Seriously going to miss seeing him do outrageous things most of us could only imagine trying. If I had ever had a chance to meet him and shake his hand, I’d thank him for all the fun and thrilling adrenaline rushes.
La precisión que tenía Ken Block en sus reflejos era excelente, el fue un grande
#KB43VER
Forever a legend! Love you, Ken!

The alleyoop at 4:53 is such a nice shot
I really dislike electric cars RIP KEN

Yet all the freaks will deny that he uses Electric parts to absolutely shred the course.
Rest in Peace. Thx for big Entertainment 🫡
最初、？？？ってなった
Те кто говорит что ауди не едет боком что нельзя дрифтовать вот пожалуйста
Your whole tribe is carrying your legacy Ken, you'd be so proud of em. KB43ver
❤❤❤
One word, respect.  +
This is cool and depressing because I'm just finding out he has passed. I have been watching him since the beginning of the early 2000s when YouTube starting booming. Rip Ken you will definitely be missed.
Just think he drove everywhere at 100 miles an hour .and yet died on a snowmobile 😢
Ken was a master. Miss him. Anyway, as powerful is a car if you can't hear it its like a cart. All those spins and not a sound of revs...
Rest in Power Ken Block.  A truly skilful and entertaining driver. Condolences. 🫡 🙏🏽
Ken block it was a god in drifting
🎉🎉🎉
Wow show long just on road runs car speed up stop at all times scary on road kupchak sefy you day appearances getting speed car you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Legend never die
i will always day dream about finding and buying Ken Block's old Focus. last time i look for it at auction, it was sold to a private owner for around 130k i think. if i ever have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend, the first 200k are going into either buying t hat focus or recreating it from parts. RIP Ken Block
😂 Elektronik bull Shit
представь как человек чувствует машину.Сколько пробных заездов ты видел у Кена Блока,-продолжать?
We are much faster than you, we are Borg, powered by the sun like Superman.
60s 70s 80s born legendry and die legendry
Ken was a CHINGON behind the wheel. He was a true master of badassery.
make me sad and proud at the SAME TIME...............................
Who can ever replace Ken?!!! The man was super human!
Sounds like a drone 🤔🤔🤔
I love this part 4:21
Очень крутой гонщик,царствие небесное!

Rest In Peace Ken, you have been an inspiration and a overall amazing role model to what I would love to imagine I could be. never could I imagine you would leave so soon truly a loss to the world and automotive community. Your skillset and knowledge will, never be matched. I've been watching since I was in high-school. To your daughter keep doing the best you can, fuck the haters and do what you want to. best wishes.
Where's dom?
#KB43VER I am learning to drive because of you. Nearly got my license. Failed first time with 96% missed 4 head checks. With my Ken Block Hoonigan keyring on my car keys. Rest Easy Ken, say Hi to my Mum. XX
I showed my dad the hoonicorn and he said “he drives like me” it wasn’t till this video I noticed they both were born in the 60s. I was like “that makes sense! Rest in peace ken block
#KB43VER
Прощай навсегда, легенда.......

Очень и очень жаль. Еще с полгода назад пересматривал Твои ролики десятилетней давности. То было лучшее время, время надежд, время стремительного будущего, которое наступает здесь и сейчас, и за всем этим только успеваешь следить. А тут в одну ночь, спустя год после этого понимаешь, что 2023 упомянутый в начале этого ролика это непросто дата...
Only the Best ❤
👍👍❤️❤️❣️💕💕💗🇮🇳💓💖💟💖💖💓💓💓❤️👍👍👍
This make anybody else's eyeballs sweaty?
Who is ken block?  first time i heard this name now he's dead?
First hoonigan video I’ve watched since his passing, did not disappoint 💪🏽

🛑  STOP   🛑    🙏 PLEASE tell me what happened to this superb driver ? how did he pass?
Rest in peace the legend
Race in PEACE BRO!!!
What happend to ken
Ken has secured himself legendary status as a driver.
Электро это черезчур.  Кен вечная память , но электро это какая-то гейская тема. Двс самое то

I can't listen to this sound, it's terrible, there's nothing like a decent V6 V8 or more
Araç elektrikli sanırım benzinli dizel olsaydı sesi mükemmel çıkardı adrenalin seviyemiz daha iyi olurdu
Yo .. This is my wheel guy................... FOR LIFE....ON KING DAVID.... ON LARRY.... SHOT out hoonigan 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💯
RIP Ken ... imagine if Audi made road going production version of this car
What is the purpose of this video?
I’m sorry but i can‘t watch this…
Better then Testa
классный мужик был- профессионал своего дела !!!
Freaking epic. Rest in peace Ken. You are sorely missed.
Just remeber guys, anytime you look outside and you see clouds in the sky, its Ken slaying tires the same way he made his legacy. KB43VER
awesome
Your legacy will live on forever Ken ❤
i likeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Rip Ken. The electric cars don't have the same powerful sound/ presence/ toughness -so to speak. Their fast AF no doubt. I get more of a feeling of the rpms and throttle response watching him drive in a gas engine. The electric car just doesn't do it for me. Again RIP your a beast, your a rare specimen of talent.
Легенда, ты останешься в наших сердцах на всегда!!!!
Matt & Kim ❤
Am from India I love ken block ❤he is god gifted one and only ken❤❤
Troca o motor porque eu não gostei, parece que tá pilotando um pernilongo com asma. Obrigado.
Half of these shots look fake.  Some of them look like real shots but others looks like cgi shots.  Even my gf walked into the room while I was watching this and asked if it was cgi not knowing anything about the GYMKHANA video series.  The lighting is off on a bunch of shots.  The camera shakes like the operator is having a seizure.  The car will wizz past a camera that barely shakes when he passes it.  Something just seems off about half of these shots.
Coming here after some videos of Zonda. This sounds soooo lame. Awesome driving skills though.
See, now if all evs were somewhat like this, nobody would hate them
Es verdad que Ken block se mató este año con una moto de nieve decirme la verdad por qué no me gustan estos bullys
Без рева ДВС, Кенблок не тот)
THE END DISCLAIMER THE REALEST SH** I READ ALL YEAR, TAKEOVERS ARE DUMB DONT RUIN IT FOR US
RIP Ken the GOAT. I never really had an interest in cars or racing till I watched the first Gymkhana and it ignited a love for rally and drift in me ❤❤❤
Ken Block was the modern Ken Miles
Missing you today, Ken Block! ❤
I love Yall!!
He will always be remembered
❤❤❤❤❤👍🏻
Super 👍 Tare ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Ken will forever be the GOAT. I just found him and I already miss him.
lack of engine noise and steering wheel feel... Ken Block was a lil sloppy in this run..
It took only 65x recharges to film this video :D :D
Когда история на ночь?
RIP Ken Block, incredible visionary, and incredible athlete to be able to execute this stuff.  Idk what else to call it other than extreme athleticism.
EV car, no thanks, I don't care how fast they go. Soulless! #byeken
that's why he's the GOAT. cheers for the got time we had. miss u Ken
Some of the greatest content captured by the legendary Hoonigan Team...  Miss you guys, RIP Ken , you entertained, you amazed, you were larger than life. Motorsports and your millions of fans  will  continue to be awestruck by your Videos.  Thanxs Scotto for putting together such an awesome team, and creating 1 of a kind, FIRST of there  kind videos that showcased some of the talents of the late Ken Block.
Hi can anyone please explain to me. How the front wheels are rotating clockwise and the rear wheels are rotating in the anticlockwise direction?
To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion. may peace and calmness fill your life
Tesla makes me want to puke
HA, HA, HA, THEY PUT IT IN THE AIFA BECAUSE IT'S EMPTY OF PEOPLE IN CARS AND EVERYTHING....

He truly was the most spectacular driver in motor sport

In theWords of somebody pretty fucking cool did I just break itLove    ❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉😮 now check this out
legends never die... they become part of you...
God: "Welcome to Heaven! You got here a little sooner then even I expected...." Ken:  "Well, this is awkward, I mean, what I am I supposed to do now? I'm a race car driver...... God:  "Hands Ken the keys to his Car collection: Ken:  "Smiles" God: "Just one thing to remember if you please". Ken:  "what's that?" God:  "Don't Slow Down !!"

He was i big person!
ViVA blok viva hoonigan🔥
Помним КЕНА БЛОКА 💪
this dangerous and awesome ❤❤
dig it, im happy we got one more.. but its not the same without the engine screaming at us and feeling the bass/rumble from the engine... i also noticed he hit multiple things in this film. doesnt seem like he enjoyed this electric crap as much as he did driving a real car. look how many mess ups he had in the audi compared to almost anything else.. or its the fact they they didnt have as much footage to edit this. either way. happy but not happy about the car used in the last video for this series. Audi  probably gave him more freedom than Ford did. cant stand the noise of this car. sounds like my brothers RC cars
ecar propaganda
im scared to turn a motorcycle 180 degrees in larger gaps than he does donuts in.
Hoped to see some real racing, but found only dumb drifting shit…
8:22 to 11:04 had me balling we will forever miss you ken truly end of an era.... #KB43VER
4:20 ken thought he was gonna hit the curb but nope hes like that
Legend❤❤❤❤
This SOAB is pretty much crazy as skilled. GO(D)AT
you make every subject you touch interesting and engaging!
we love u bro
RIP 😢
Super
Amazing

The only way I'm buying a EV
Que finoo 😊
Super emocionante
Being a kid from the 80s & sitting here in 2024 ,this has a Marty Mcfly & the DeLorean touch about it. I like to think Ken's not gone, he's just gone back to the future. 💙🤜🏻🇦🇺🇺🇸🤛🏻❤️
I like this video but why it is post so late?
R.I.P. Ken! Thank you for all you've done for the car sports and for all of us fans. ❤️ #KB43VER
やっぱ、電気は音が高いね。
When he did the 360 during the almost 360circle drift  😮😮😮😮😮 RIP Ken Block
im sorry
RIP to the GOAT. No one to ever come close.
come india and drive world highst roads khardunglaaa
No new videos and fun... Rest in peace Big Man Ken Block... You  are in our hearts...
Legends don't die
Sounds like a toy car
:,(
Why did this video look computerized????
Great video. RIP, but I think the legend would rather have adventure than peace.

He’s not dead 😌
I’m just thankful I got to live in the same timeline as Ken. There will never be another like him. RIP bro.
The logistics for this.............
My first time experiencing his  vids, ever. 🤯 The skill of this man would make certain rising sun legends blush. Rejoice In Peace friend
Не увлекаюсь особо автоспортом , но увидев как Ken водит машину , понял , это шедевр . Машина была для него как вторая кожа , он жил в ней и она его защищала , в снегоходе он был без защиты , ну нафига его понесло на этот долбаный снегоход .
❤❤❤
Se que alo mejor no me entiendan  ami me encantaba ver a Ken lo deje de ver por un tiempo y cuando lo voy vi a ver un 5 de enero del 2023 supe que falleció lo lamento mucho pero falleció asiendo lo que le gustaba lo extrañare
คันโปก...
the end of the video, nostalgia right to tears, the times of the game dirt 3, the craziest tricks from Ken.....It's so nice to remember.... We remember you, Ken, and we will never forget you....
Der kann fahren  geniales teil
Джимхана без Кена, не та уже, не смотря на то, что Пастрана старается, Кен -гений своего времени и своего дела
Tu nous manques !!! 🙏⚡♥️
I dont know why i laugh every time i hear an electric car it jus sounds funny to me lol.

Allah rahmet eylesin mekanı cennet olsun inşallah
The best driver ever !!! You will be missed !! KB43ver!!
почему в машине для дрифта нет радио ?
Like for Ken, comment for Ken
Thank you for that! Do yall have anything on Ken talking about how that car ran and moved? That was wild to see a car move like he was so good at!!
sound of those electric cars is really awful, hopefuly Ken delivers the show even muted :D
Ken... <3
Rip Ken you will always be in our hearts

так себе. у него бывали видосы и по лучше
That Focus was possessed
This man made me love drifting and motorsports, I remember being blown away by the first one in high school. Truly a legend and inspiration to what you can do at any point in your life
Такой человек не могу у мереть в кровати. Покойся с миром Кен.
çok özledik be...
legends never die.
I love Ken and love the mustang to raw power the noise, but electric dose not excite me at all.
it's crazy old man, nice drift !!
атмосфера это сила и эмоция которую не чем не заменить.

great driving as usual. RIP Ken. Bad choice on going electric. Hard to watch without the great roar of the engine. couldn't watch it.
Без звука двигателя и породистого выхлопа не интересно смотреть. Кен Блок конечно профи но машина говно!
why have I never seen this video before?????
Naaah brooo i miss that voice! 😩😩😩😩😩😩 we always love you master! #KB43EVER
Watching this man has always held a special place in my heart like the first time you see 100 fly by on the speedo. Rest easy legend... blast through the clouds like a sidewinder missile, we'll all be looking up ❤
Лучший!
The most dangerous part was when he drove beneath that Boeing 787 flying overhead.
Dang Jewish ancestry, had I not had it beat into my head to conserve and be practical I could have been a race car driver and done cool stuff like that
The electrical car soundwise hits not the same ..😅
RIP Ken gone but never forgotten
Снимите такси 6 с кеном блоком и люком бессоном make Movie taxi 6 with ken block and luke besson

Las mejores escenas acroabasias que iso de riesgo y viene a morir así descansa en paz Ken Brown43😢😢🕊️
El juca salvaje ese?
ken make electrik car look not so bad. rip legend
R.I.P.
When people complain about electric cars not having cool engine sounds I always point them to this
I can't even imagine how many times he went through. Where all those burnouts.😆
The man maybe gone but the legend will live forever
The editing on this production is absolutely top notch
This sounds like the DeLorean from B2TF when it's drifting around the parking lot!
Шняга
Im still crying over the loss of Ken block to this day. 43 forever
I'll unbelievable.... R. I. P legend Ken

Кен красавчик без сомнения!! Есть и в России такие безумцы, Сергей Кабаргин, Аркадий Цареградцев! Я думаю они тоже много чего могут из таких движух!!!
they should name it Kenkhana

4:46 OMFG …. Yooooooooooowwwwwwwwwww this is pure 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Жужащая электричка конечно мощная и очень хороша но мир ралли немного не о том. Бензинки с ревом и хлопками вот настоящее ралли.
Великий был человек!💪в моем сердце и памяти на всегда он будет!😢
Очень жаль что Кена нет с нами он, один из немногих экстремалов мог  управлять, машиной на грани соприкосновения вечная память и уважение Кену в России его уважают и помнят
Никакого коня и чепушилу мне никто не впарит😹😹😹
Exelente

жаль этого добряка. всегда буду о нем помнить. ЛЕГЕНДА!

Такой болид должен перемещаться в пространстве с другим звуком. Или я просто старый?
Shame on you! Please don't click bait Ken's name, he is obviously a legend & we all know it but click baiting by using his name is not fair to his legacy!
Ken Block, always in our hearts ❤.  You will never be forgotten my man

What in the Mandela Effect? I swear I he died more than a year ago.
you were a 1 of a kind ken!!!! we will all miss you. I hope that you are tearing it up wherever you are R.I.P. and God bless you.
#kb43ver rip ken
We need a Liakana next. She would be the next Block to carve the way.
😂
I just came to know that unfortunately he died, I used to watch him with my dad when I was about 4 years old and I loved to watch him for the acrobatics and everything he did. I recently bought his ford focus, the 65' mustang and the Ford F-100 in Forza Horizon 5 for him. If it was already an honor for me to drive those vehicles without knowing he had passed away, now it is even more so. R.I.P Ken Block you will be remembered 43VER <3

Amazing Donut. Rest in Peace.

I guess you’ll never really top Gymkhana 2022.

Only I hope he is alive and well in another timeline.
What a legend in driving... Amd this electric sound is the best...

Se lo echa de menos
We mis you ken
So much hate between people… jeez. All you haters and fanboys need to peddle back a bit. The man is no longer with us. Show a little respect and dignity.  To the haters: you are correct to a degree. Was he as prolific on the podium? No, he wasn’t. High level competition racing was never really Ken’s strong point in driving. Ken shined when it came to precision driving. Like Travis Pastrana (I’m sure I’ll catch heat for dropping that name 🤦‍♂️), he exceled at making his machine do what he wanted when he wanted to do it in a controlled environment. You can deny his legacy on the podium all day and I’ll support you. But to say he wasn’t a talented driver?? Your smoked bro. I guarantee you could NEVER do what he did. Find some humility.  To the fanboys: Seriously, get off Ken’s dick. Chill out. I get he was an idol for you growing up, but sentimentality has no place in this court, so please throw that shit away. I don’t care about your feelings. What I care about is looking at what he accomplished. You have no room to debate his talent in competitive racing against other drivers directly. He doesn’t have a podium resume like most of the other prolific podium legends. Ken excels in precision driving. That’s what you should be praising him for. He changed the game when it came showcasing precision driving. He gave the exposure they needed to make it wildly popular. He is a legend in his own right, for forging his own path to greatness. Yes, he’s a very talented driver, just not when it came to competitive podium racing. Sue me. lol
Great Video, just turn the sound off.
Bro, like I didn't think you could make it better car than the Ford mustang man goddamn but this is like top notch bro. It sounds like a goddamn rocket and looks like one too cuz you're freaking leaving smoke behind you then to top it off you got mad GTA 5 thing going on love it

Heart warming to see all the other content creator's showing their respect in the comments.

RIP Ken🙏 Grab the keys Lia, long live the Queen.

Слава Великому Кену, жаль, что он ушёл...... Чувствуется, что машинка тяжёлая  и управление не очень из-за этого! Вечная память этому герою!!!!!!
Одна турбина хорошо, а две ещё лучше 👆👍
He should be careful doing stuff like that
Не увидел сложных элементов((( Все дороги широкие с прогнозируемым чистым асфальтом! Во всех поворотах много следов от предидущих дублей! Круттая подача, модные костюмы и антураж(((

The 2017 and 2018 has best scenes for me 😮🤩😲😱🤯
I started too late in the cars scene😭 I missed legends RIP Ken🙏🏽
Will we ever see another driver like Ken…I don’t think so. He was the master of the road and a Genius behind the wheel and at one with all his cars. You will be missed mate…RIP
Помним на всегда ты был лучшим вечная тебе память ❤❤❤❤
Wow
I wish I could have a job like that he really lived life to the fullest RIP Ken !!✊
какой же противный звук у электрички! как будто глисты ползают по стеклу! толи дело атмо V8 и выше! даже хрюканье ротора для ушей приятнее!

Okay, okay, well done. But how many charges was that? 😂
Легендарный гонщик... Жаль, очень Жаль... Но лучше чем от водки и от простуд....

Niech pokażą w całości nie urywkami jak mu szło lecz już RIP
💔🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Не то, скрип , писк , где брутальный рев двигателя
He will never die in the motorsport world and in our hearts.  The first video I saw was over 12 years ago and hopefully it will stay with us forever. KB43VER
Press F, Legend!
Лучший,прощай легенда
My teen gears were completely dedicated to DC. My adult life, still never a dull moment watching this man make history. Forever in our hearts. #DC43. 🙏🏼

You have inspired so many of us year after year. I want to say from he bottom of my heart thank you 10 fold for all you have done for the life of cars.  You will forever be remembered as a legend. Thank you Ken🤩
Grande Ken Block , jamas te olvidaremos
Totally not crying or anything right now. Call me weird or whatever, but that audio clip of Ken saying "so we can be done" at the end....damn, it was good to hear his voice, and it's a heartbreaker that there will never again be such an inspirational voice as his. What a legend💛
Вечная память легенда и спасибо за детсво❤❤❤#KB43VER
How do one have so much control
Видео о том как быстро передвигается дым
❤ me gusta mucho😊🎉
Muh Richard Petty.
Say what you want about the performance of an EV, the lack of proper sound make it quiet sad, love those older Clip at the end, bring back some good memories
NO NO NO, again NO ! FUCK ELECTRIC '' WEE WEE'' !!!
QUE PERRO VIDEASO ALV
Welcome to Mexico Hoonigan superstar! We will remember you forever on!
Electric cars are soulless
Electric cars are ghey and sound like shit.
What to say about this incredible driver. The ultimate teacher. You will always be in our hearts !!
WHAT I just learned that he is dead his time i am starting to watch his video with sad mode. One legend gone
Ich finde Ken Blog super aber das Gepfeife nervt mich! Das braucht V8!
อยากนั่งสักครั้งแต่ไม่มีตังแม้แต่จะซื้อตั๋ว
Лучший в своем деле! Тебя будет не хватать. Покойся с миром.
R.I.P
He died cause he broke rule he shouldnt...    he go electric so god get rid of him....
Get so emotional thinking about and seeing Ken. God Speed young fella and God bless you and your whole Fam 💛
It always amazes me how those tyres can last as long as they do given the extreme punishment they are getting from start to finish.... ! RIP KB
End of a era that will never be forgotten
😢😢 💔💔💔🇮🇩🇮🇩
🙏Rest in Peace
I love Ken Block R.I.P

The final and last video from Ken block😢
Una parola sola LEGGENDA❤
Легенда.

the loss of a true icon. This is something the car community will never get over. Rest in peace to a true legend!
I don't hear a sound, I don't feel a soul.
I still remember the first one... like a yesterday...
Where is the engine sound?😢
Ken, you rocked the world in motor sports!  Thanks for the memories!  God bless the Hoonigan family.   #kb43ver
Не могу сказать покойся с миром Кен… это просто не возможно. Ты в мире лучших моторов…в мире лучших машин…ты навсегда в наших сердцах!!! Ты лучший!!!

This is a great car to drive around in crew motorfest
Кен ты был лучшим ,я видел все твои заезды, ты привил мне любовь к моей машине  ведь ты очень часто ездил на этой марке покойся с миром , мы тебя помним.
R.I.P  Mein herzliches Beileid an Fam. Block...traurig das er so früh von uns gegangen ist. Leider hab ich es erst heute durch Zufall erfahren und war geschockt.... " Nur die Besten, sterben jung"
This is sloppy compared to all the other videos ..
Thank you Dirt 2 for introduce me to this legend.
Masterful...   . Viva ken Block!!!43.
RIP Master! Focus RS - Your best car🫡
It's so sad😥
🤍🤍🤍O melhor de todos
Rip legend 😢❤
We can replace chairs, we can replace cars, we can replace microphones, but we cannot replace Ken Block.
dünyaya inen en iyi yarış pilotu ve insanı  ruhu şad olsun 🖤
Thank you Hoonigan. Thank you to Ken Block for everything hes done. Fantastic video, but certainly a tough watch. RIP Ken Block.

BIG RESPECT TO kEN, rest in peace. But no respect to electric shit, before they can solve a 100% charging under 15 min
I missed half the show making that comment hang on let me press the rewind button LOL outstanding
Thanks again for your help KEN ☺️. I miss you so much ❣️ but when I was watching that Jay turn on the highway there in Mexico. All I can think to myself is slowpoke Rodriguez. Not even close 💯🙏😜🐕‍🦺🇺🇸🫨
EV is boring.  RP Ken.
Kenneth я твой кумир, ты ушел как Легенда, но мы тебя помним и стараемся повторять лучшее!!!!!!
R.I.P. to a legend, an icon, and a hero to many. We wont forget you Ken❤
Straight up legend 43ver
We miss you Mr Block . Your gift to us is all this madness you left. R.I.P. ..🙏
How can a video 1 month old cry when it has been DEAD since January 2nd, 2023
Isnt he dead?
Niepowtarzalny. Drugiego takiego nie będzie 👊👍❤
Great sir .. India
ye . cool and all.  just i duno never was too into the brand and such.   only thing i wonder is like how dude felt , liked/disliked the change to super stronk electric and away from clutch and man trans.   i suppose since they're like THAT good and torquey quick etc that its probably i duno say easier but diff . maybe more fun being able just electronically drop it down and immediately have all 4 wheels be able to just sit and spin.   i duno beats me I'll never have or drive anything remotely that cool nice fast . even electric so duno probably why i really never cared much to watch the stuff.  rip tho . deuaces
Когда я посмотрел видос и все моменты в конце я вспомнил всё благодаря вам и Кен Блок был величайшим гонщиком и семьёй то что он проделал большую жизнь к автоспорту и трюкам спасибо вам то что сделали такую возможность посмотреть моменты которых не вернуть те времена Кен Блок всегда будет в моём сердце за то что он покорил сердца таким исполнением его наследие никогда не погибнет оно всегда будет с нами  С любовью России🤍 и от меня лично  Когда я посмотрел видос до конца я заплакал если честно 😔
Ken will be missed all over the world. We are blessed to be able to witness history in the making. His daughter will probably keep the gymkhana spirit alive! God bless the Block family!
Reposes en paix Ken Block. 😪🕊 Il restera une légende du sport auto. 👏💪🚗💨🔥
Imagine how many sets of tires they went through during filming.
I miss you Ken block😢 you always my biggest fan in my life. An honor from us you may burn the tires in Heaven.
Enough to make an old man cry... 😢
why no one there?🤔
4WD = 4 wheel dance - a-ma-zing.
This car sounds like a space ship from The Jetsons RIP to the greatest to ever do it ❤
Ken will never be forgotten ❤all the love to his family and friends. Only Ken could make electro-cars this insanely cool.
I miss you Ken block ❤❤❤❤
Il est trop fort ce mec
RIP Block  Too late for him, he was a legendary 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I crashed my car because of Ken BLock !
January 1st 12:01am I made the promise to myself that I would go meet one of my heroes that year. Unfortunately, a few hours later, I would find out that would never happen. This symphony of driving brought me to tears, but in the end, it brought back all the happy memories of him. We hoon on for him. Don't slow down, Hoon on.
😭🙏
4:56 doesn't even look like a car. Just a hovering ship. So sick
I couldn’t watch this video for a while bc it’s crazy to think he is gone. Watched a video tribute earlier with scotto, pastrana, mad mike n a couple others. It helped hearing the stories they brought to watch the video. Of course another wild gymkhana with some insane driving from the best KB43.  Ken, we all miss you, hope your ripping it with the other greats. #KB43VER
Damnit man still brings a tear to my eye.......
El Juca en el video con el bocho increible que bueno que salió
SO SICK SHAME HES GONE GONNA MISS HIS VIDEOS
Le ROI de la route éternel. Reste dans nos ❤. Adieu
Ken Block 4 life 🔥❤️🫶🏿👑🚘
I'm smiling and sad all at the same time. KB4ever. I really miss the hoonicorn v1 too
I don't know if, or when, I'll be able to watch this. Hopefully someday without blurry vision from bleedin waterworks  RiP you madman. The adrenaline, and the push you shared, inspired many to live at a level more then thought possible.  Thank you.
It sounds like the toy RC car from Toy Story as they're chasing the moving truck. Can someone please bring back V8s? Please and thank you.
these electric cars sound stupid as hell
Where is the sound of the internal combustion engine?
*L E G E N D !*
El Juca en su bocho jeje
Audi should make a homologation of these
R.I.P
YA PASO UN AÑO DE MI IDOLO MAS GRANDE ........... SUEÑO SER COMO EL ........... PERO EL ERA UN DIOS FUERA DE ESTE MUNDO........... EL NACIÓ CON UN VOLANTE EN LAS MANOS............. GRANDE KEN BLOCK
I am sure he is now drifting the hell out of the angels wings <3
Lo mejor de lo mejor un abrazo hasta el cielo ❤
❤❤❤
ВЕЧНАЯ ПАМАТЬ ЭЛЕКТРИЧКЕ ЗВУК  БЛЯТЬ ЕБАТЬ
damn. its been a year since ken left us. wow. just wow.
Good bay legend [*] 😢
❤love you brother!❤
#KB43VER
I will show your gymkhana videos to my son one day ❤
Thank you Ken for being great guy and enterteining us for all these years.Fly High🕊
RIP Ken. I hope Lia carries the legend. She has been a badass so far!  I'm sure this was hard to produce.   43!!!
Gloria a la leyenda 💫 Q.E.P.D Ken
¡Hay cabron!  😇
RIP 43
Hola estamos a un año de la perdida de Ken Block y le damos el pésame a la familia lo estrañamos muchísimo un gran amigo Ken Block 💝💝💝💝
G.O.A.T....... R.I.P
His loss hurts me to this day...I can barely watch this channel anymore
I can’t even enjoy watching it. Miss you ken
No puedo creer que el último video fue en México que orgullo y trabajo cerca de ahí casi lloro me encantaba ver a len haciendo lo suyo 😢 derrapa en el cielo ídolo
Désolé mais l'électrique n'aura jamais les mêmes plaisir que le thermique
Das ist Trackmania in echt.
Ken Block was my inspiration that got me into racing, drifting.... I hope this piece of memory stays in all of us. 43❤❤
жаль,,,,,, помер легенда
If you not scared youre not going fast enough🥀
I hope they put his kid in the car and continue making these videos. Would be cool to see the next generation carry on his legacy.
What are the paddles behind the steering wheel for on an electric car?
😢
Mexico City is so modern, beautiful and green.
9:50 Damn that hits hard, "I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth" lou gehrig.
Still so sad...
Ken Block por siempre en nuestros corazones ❤🕊️
After seeing this, I will by the Lego 76921Audi S1 e-tron quattro Race Car😁
I hate what the future holds. It's not the same without an engine.
Then please, all fuel engine moron, please tell me electric race car are not nice?!
Love the action
Esse cara é uma lenda, descanse em paz! 🙏🖤
I swear Ken’s just playing forza
R.I.P.
Amazing!
gercektende saçma
Its a tie-fighter
where does all the dust from worn tyres go, folks?          Isn't time to stop having petrol head hardons at the expense of where we live?  Electric?   Yay.  Are the tires and brake pads also electric?  No.   Tyre rubber powder has sedimented and filled up the earth with our rubber and brake pads.    Go petrol head jo's
Drifting through a full loop would be s😊o dope especially seeing the car go upside down.
I wasn't ready for that compilation at the end to get me emotional. We miss you Ken, history will remember you as one of the greatest.
FUISTE, ERES Y POR SIEMPRE SERÁS IRREMPLASABLE ......E INOLVIDABLE PARA NOSOTROS TUS FANS.....GRACIAS AMIGO
Aquí por Juca 🫡🔥😎
Nothing beats the sound of and gas engine shifting it brings more adrenaline....  Got to say Ken makes driving and electric fun
I just hope Lia Will Carry on his legacy
RIP MR. KEN BLOCK, AND WE  WILL WAIT FOR YOU EVERY 1ST OF NOMBER IN YOUR PATH TROUGH MICTLAN.
R.I.P. Кен, будем помнить
Невозможно смотреть и слушать эжту пищалку. Антилайк
Елы палы, электричке в дрифте.... Бедный блок там переворачивается наверно в земле😢
You can still do it Ken...Oh !, but you are.  Legends never die.
Электро дрифт, как порно с резиновой куклой😢
Mr Donut, in WRC competitions, he was very bad, because he can't drive like Sebastien LOEB.🙃 He was just good at RallyAmerica, but it's just America.🤣
got mixed feeling, feels like ken still with us
My favorite car hoonigan ❤❤💛💛
あなたの笑顔を見ていると、また明日も楽しく車に乗っているかのように思えます 世界中のモータースポーツファンを魅了したあなたを永遠に忘れることは無いでしょう
yeah, just not the same.... sorry
RIP K.Block.  It's been 1 year since the world lost a legend.
Brutal, nae#21
RIP COOL KEN!
NO ONE WILL EVER DO IT LIKE KEN #KB43VER
hire this man for the new fast and ferious
What a driver you will always be missed
Россия любит тебя Кен❤❤❤ Славных дорог тебе на небесах и бесконечных лошадиных сил под капотом😎
where is the brap brap braprpprprprpr
❤
👎👎👎👎
Что за ерунда
RIP Mr. Block one the greatest to ever live 43ver
🎉ohhh...E-Schrott 🎉
Missed ❤❤❤
a legend gone. but never forgotten
Ken, as a Gen X drifter from the late 1980s you will be missed.   Hope your girl can pick up the gauntlet you laid down.😢    Miss drifting my '74 Mercury Cougar XR7 throughout the allys and mall lots scaring the passengers 😂
This just proves that EV isnt as cool. The sound is interesting but nothing like the hoonicorn or the Ford's. They are just beautiful sounding. This is like a fly constantly buzzing in your ear.
Thank you Ken for all the memories truly lost one of the greatest people in Motorsport with your incredible skill rest in peace #KB43VER
Watching this on Jan 2nd hurts knowing it’s been a full year now without this amazing man, fly high KB43VER
R.I.P Mr.Block, you are missed immensely but we will never forget all the amazing things you did <3
Whats up with the weird CG
Легенды не умирают. ♥♥♥   Небесной джимханы, покажи им как гоняют настоящие профи. #KB43VER
It took me a while to work up the nerve to watch this one.. 😢
All that just to die driving what amounts to a childs play thing by comparison.
It's hard to believe that he's been gone for a year now. Always remembered, never forgotten.   #KB43VER
RIP ! #KB43ver
Drift in peace, Hero.
Ken is gone now.  R.I.P.  Now the rest of the team is fading out.  I will miss this group.
Menuda mierda
Respeto máximo para ken block💯🖤 R.i.p🖤 EL KING🫅
A beautiful tribute for a legend of motorsport, we will never forget you Ken Block 🙏 you was a legend for me and lot of other people and you will stay forever 🙏
1 year ago today, we lost a legend, rest in peace ken blocks
its been a year. and we truly still miss you
♥♥♥
Happy birthday Ken you changed my life and I would love to make even a fraction of the change you made to the world.❤❤❤
A year ago today since we lost Ken. A year later, he’s still igniting people’s passion for motorsport. I still find it hard to believe he took part in the Donegal Rally, my home county. Thank you for inspiring all of us #KB43VER
Sir ken block you are my hero you and my dad Very cool people
4:07 GRANDE @JUCA
Alamadre juca 😮
We miss you 43. But, the Jackson’s car noises….fuck! We miss de gasoline to.

4:20 i make the same face at this moment XD
this video looks like IA generated :o
[*]
Ken sprayed nine lives away but he did it in style.
"Takeovers are dumb."  Well said, Hoonigan, well said.
R.I.P the GOAT👑
Electric cars are boooring
Absolutely the greatest driver there was!🤘 Will never be forgotten RIParidise   #KB43VER
Group B was really better, just fuck his tires and ? Without the sound effect it's...
Boring. R.I.P.
Eternal memory to Ken Block! ♥♥♥ So much energy and real inspiration! Rest in peace, friend!
Но это почти нереально развить 330 км ч в городе на S1 !    САМ играю на прокаченой S1 В CREW2 Только 380 мог выжать! И это игра,а не рельность!
I love broooooo
Rip #kb43ver there are many who aspire to be, many who attempt vague imitation,  there are many tributes in memory, but there was only one KB, hoonigan was set in metal and added to the dictionary through your efforts and ability to thread the needle through
R.I.P
unreal driver, amazing strong battery =)
это легегда!!!
Yes sir
Would've been cool to hear the classic Audi 5 Cylinder sound track but still a cool looking car.
if you close your eyes it sounds like a spaceship. rip king
Ken, you and the hoonigan crew will always be remembered, you put on an impressive show with amazing shots. Rest in peace, legend
CGI
он кстати при жизни. у всех в роот бра4л нормальных гонщиков ! чисто Агутин Моисеев и Зверев из мира ралли
хорошо что его больше нет , надоели тупые видео
Ты в сердце брат ❤, в памяти 🕯
The car looks so good, but it sounds so damn annoying!
peyyyyyyyooo peeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyy
Rest Easy Legend❤ Sending love to your family and loved ones❤
Ken всегда в наших сердцах!!!
не то(
You will always be in our hearts and mind Ken,you are the one.....❤
R.I.P Ken Block
Did the cinematographer change? There is no motion blur and background blur in most parts of the video. At some moments, unnecessary zoom is used. Come on man, the video is already very enjoyable, you don't need to resort to video tricks.
Why this video lookng like fake or montage ?
This is impressive but nothing will beat the sound of a twin turbo ford on limiter 👌🏻
The Master at work. #KB43VER.
Земля тебе пухом, бро😢
This is the most fake shit I've ever seen..... He was amazing, this is shit.
Mierd,que buen video!
Rest in Power
Tanta gente y tenia que salir el naco de juca 🤦🤦🤦
Почтим память Кена Блока как самого лучшего в мире💪 Я был его фанатом с давних лет и был впечатлен его талантом и мастерством👍 очень жаль что 2023г забрал его у нас, зрителей💔 Это была последняя джинманна с его участием. Легенда, спи спокойно😔
Can't wait to see what Ken comes up with in 2024!
Amazing what AI and holograms can do these days. Wow. RIP Ben Klock
No matter what people say... electric engines suck!... R.I.P. Ken Block the legend.
Reminds me of the awkward dancing when they remove the music and just put in grunts and footsteps...
Кен Блок, хорош(   Электро машинки дрянь
Cold War HC S&D ?
RIP Ken Block, that mf sure knew how to drive TF out of a car
Great performance from both car and driver but that electric engine sound is just awful
<3
Is that a rocket? thats too much smoke 😂

Вечная память Кену Блоку, ты навсегда в наших сердцах

So traurig der Abschluss. Leider komplett ohne Emotionen mit so einem Elektro Auto echt schade für mich wird er immer Ford sitzen.😢

RIP Ken Block could alway make a fast and furious trick 🙏
@4:21 When HP isn't enough you will it out of the bump!!!

That noise is so annoying. Only thing that made it bearable was the shear skill that Ken Block had. R.I.P legend
Miss you ken
The greatest maniac to ever shred a tyre for YouTube KB43VER
This was so hard to watch. Thank you Hoonigan team for putting this together. All the love for the Block family.  KB43VER!

Just amazing! Damn, can't believe this is the last one. KB43ver.
Que hace el pelado de Juca ahi?
estoy viendo a un fallecido correr...? bueno, la hija anda por ahi haciendo pinitos... a ver si la ponen ya a correr con los electricos para audi y por lo menos alguien se pone a hacerlos, que si es una pena etc etc etcc.. pero quien narices nos da el entretenimiento ahora? aun no hay suplente para conducir un cochecito"....? venga va...
Your not only burning the tire but also the motors
Электричка не интересна 😢😢😢

#kb43ver
Dude F snowmobiles am I right? so sad right now.
rip
The fact that they shut down Mexico City for this is amazing. Ken was and is a legend . Will be missed .
RIP Legend
Legend says that Ken was so upset driving this ridiculously stupid car from Audi that he left us. Even in his face impression was kind of sad. He cant stand that this must be new gen. of racing car. RIP LEGEND !
Just aint care. About electric cars
Legend the one and only
Rest in peace bud
Раньше графика была похожа на реальность, а теперь реальность похожа на графику😅
Столько крутых вещей, гонок и моментов было пройдено, поистине уникальным человек любещей свою карьеру и работу, ЛЕГЕНДА всегда будет с нами.  #KB43VER
❤💛💚 Merci KEN for ever
parece um carro telecomandado, Looks a RC toy, Great Ken, RIP.
RIP Ken 😭😞
He is dead?!? where were the news?.... wtf RIP legend
Жаль только что звук стиральной машины на отжиме все портит…
Легенды не умирают!  ⛳️ 🚘 💨
😮 wait they shut down an airport for him?!
prius
Эх, целая эпоха ушла... Покойся с миром. Нам будет тебя не хватать... 🥲
RIP Ken
спасибо Hoonigan помним любим скорбим ❤❤❤love from Russia 😢
Есть две вещи которые нельзя заменить. Старину Кена и звук двигателя внутреннего сгорания.
KB43VER
How those tires manage what they do always amazes me.
Drifting in the clouds for sure...
we miss you!
Rip ken you will never be forgotten
I don't really have many words to say...
nunca te olvidaremos rey de la gymkana❤😢
Hard to believe the first one was 15 years ago. Seems like yesterday.
JUCAAAAA
RIP the legend
some of these shots look cgi
😍
I told myself I wouldn’t watch this till Christmas. It was absolutely a gift to see you ride one last time. Thanks for inspiring so many kids around the world, including myself. You’ll forever be missed Ken. I won’t ever forget the times I met and got to speak with you. #KB43ver❤
Ken B. This man YouTuber! End= Wery good Team!   But rally drive=00!  🤑
Guy was a legend but not only for his driving skill. From his involvement founding DC. Creating the MTN lab for his riders and friends and family, etc. Ken lived a truly rich and wonderful life even before his driving and racing career began. Rest in Peace Mr. Block.
Jucaa que transa banda como están que éxito bro
what a fuking annoying  noise
mengganggu perekonomian ga sih kek gini
Все понимают что гонщик он был плохой? Титулов и призов не много. Но шоумен великолепный.. Как гонщика его никто не запомнит. Топ лучших трюков это да!!!!
R.I.P the LEGEND
Took me a couple weeks before I could even watch this. I didn't have many heroes but he was my #1 hero for sure!
Great guy, awesome driving, electric is not the same.
A racing legend, Ken Block, has left this world. May the racing gods rest in peace. May your god forgive you for infecting everyone with the disease of drifting.😓😓😓
Legende einen wie ihn wird es kein zweites mal geben. Welche ironie des Schicksals Jahrzehnte mit hunderten PS und hoher Geschwindigkeit  und dann reisst dich  so ein unfall aus dem Leben. RIP❤❤❤
officially number 43, but in our hearts he will always be number one
Respect Master Ken 🙏
Ken this guy  is the best
Крутой мужик был🥲
WOW!!!
Wow! Just f.n Wow!

For some reason the death of Ken hurt more than some people that I actually know :(
2014 had the best car. That thing was a mean fuckin machine
It aint the same without a screaming ICE
Dude defied death and dies from a stupid snowmobile accident
My God that Subarus. My God that Fiesta.
yoo, i have that twin turbo Mustang in BeamNG, how crazy Ken was to drive this crazy car omagush, RIP da LEGEND
Rest in peace and thank you for all the smiles
Electric 🤮
Интересно, сколько раз ее заряжали, чтобы снять этот ролик!?
R. I. P.
Кен, помним, любим, скорбим
nice, the car repairs bei itself when driving ;)

на Мустанге круче!!!!
ご冥福をお祈り致します。 天国でも車三昧であれ。
Ну и хорошо, что всё закончилось. Смотреть на это электронедоразумение просто стыдно для любого настоящего фаната автомобилей!
"NOW THIS IS POD RACING" enough said RIP KEN
Mad respect, sir! You are THE LEGEND, may you guide the light down upon the faightful!

mexico lindo y querido...
Vengo después de ver el vídeo en el canal de juca ❤
Here is my questions......HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO SHUT A FN AIRPORT DOWN FOR A DAY OR TWO?!?!?!?!
say what u want best diver ever
He went electric and paid the price  I really hope humanity followes him he was a joy to watch and an inspiration rip brother
Que tremendos videos nos dejaste para siempre, siempre estaras aquí aunque no estes❤❤
Único y entrañable jamás será olvidado ❤❤
Блеванул
INCREIBLE LO DE JUCA SALIENDO EN EL ULTIMO VIDEO!
даже в квартире резиной запахло
So fucking sad.  Ken was, is, and will always be the fucking man.  Such a tragic loss. Cant imagine his last moments. Surprises me that he didnt have someone (attempting) following him on that ride.  His chest was crushed and a broken rib ripped into his heart if im not mistaken.  God bless him.  Please.  He will always be remembered and loved.  Never one bad thing ever said about this man, legend, and absolute hero.  Love you Ken. May i Meet you in the afterlife.  And praying for your family to get through this.  ❤️🙏🏼😔
RIP to the GOAT
wouldn t  it be cool , if every time we had  seen ken with the inboard camera,  total silence, exept from  some   smooth  jazz elevator music;))))
no sound :(
Ken uncomfortable on this car
I get teary eyed when I see this video. R..I.P. brother, you'll 4ever be missed. I see the gymkhana videos with excitement and joy now more than ever
Lots of love for you from the motorfest gang 🫡♥️♥️
Instant like, now it's watchtime 👍
😊
GOAT.
You changed the game forever,  you're the best
Кен Блок был крутой! Жаль что он ушел от нас. P.S. Звук как от игрушечной машинки)
Very impressive. I am curious as to why the dashboard was showing what gear he was in when Electric cars don't have any? RIP Ken
What a proper send off.....!!! Block just changed the game for ever! His mentality was and still is unmatched...became an idol and an influence for so many people around the world!!His contribution to the sport is enormous! Had the opportunity to watch him shred dem tires on the Gymkhana Grid in Greece a couple of years ago....what a spirit!! Goodbye for ever mate !! you will be missed! Best of wishes to your family and friends that have to live their lives with such a loss...
Sorry Ford did it better
DEATH IS NOTHING!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               It does not count. I have only slipped away into the next room. Nothing has happened.  Everything remains exactly as it was. I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.  Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference into your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.  Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together. Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.  Life means all that it ever meant. It is the same as it ever was. There is absolute and unbroken continuity. What is this death but a negligible accident?  Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just round the corner.  All is well. Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before. How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!  Henry Scott-Holland. "Death Is Nothing At All." Family Friend Poems, 2006.
это смешно, хаххаа, как машинка на пульте управления
а зачем нужны подрулевые лепестки? это же электричка
Hoonitron vs Plaid LETS GO

Как же это убого звучит, верните v8
We will always miss you Legend #LordofStreet #KenBlock
It's a pity that such a legend has gone! There will be no more of them, and all the others are just a pathetic semblance!
жаль что ушла такая легенда таких больше не будет все остальные лишь жалкое подобие
Ken 4ever!! Live in ours hearts!! We miss you!!
Bro created enough donuts to feed a whole department💀
Hello Ken I loved still you never go and here for ever.
RIP from Palestine
Легенда.  Беру на днях ауди купэ 1984года нс легендарном 5 горшковом толкателе.  Задний привод будет от фольца В3
Nice to know ken was confirmed human, he nicked the car a couple of times.
You don't know the day or the hour...
He can say “hi” to god😍😍😍😍😍
Acho muito difícil surgir outro que chegue ao nível do Block, o que esse cara fazia era surreal, uma lenda.
Thank you Ken, thank you Hoonigan. What a ride Ken, what a ride. You will be missed. KB43VER
thanks for all the magic Ken.
absolute driving BLISS....!!!! what a legend.
😍😍😍😍😍
Legend
So heartbreaking to know he's no longer with us. You left a mark Ken Block ♥
Too bad this is how he went out
Never❤
Rest In Peace   #KB43EVER
LEGEND!!!!  Legends never die!!!
One of the greatest to ever do it.
RIP Ken. I like the old 2010 ghymkana the most. Its pure driving. This one here is kind of boring.
D.E.P leyenda descansa y derrapa a tope hay donde estés ❤❤

A legend never dies and he will live on through all car cultures
this thing just sounds like an RC car
Bro how do you shut down a whole airport?
Extremely boring...
Drift in peace KB43ever
satisfatorio demaisssss

Rest in Peace king.
I refuse to believe that anyone can drive a car like this guy could. Another legend gone too soon.
Ken Block 10 Electric car 0 Big big NO for electric car
Legends never die.♥
Juca❤🎉
Just LEGEND 🎉 I will stick „HOONIGAN „ on all my cars ❤🎉 R.I.P LEGEND
I’ve been watching Ken since the hatch WRX in the snow days. From sailing away, to finishing races on 3 wheels, to the Hoonicorn in Horizon 4. Sad to see his last performance but the journey was epic.
We will all love and miss the legend Ken Block!! Just glad we did have them for the short time to set a standard for hoonigan and killin all tyres!! Truely shined the brightest.. Thnx👻
How could anyone put up with frequency. Amazing driving as always. You'll be missed! But never get rid of combustion engines
❤❤❤❤❤KB43VER❤❤❤❤❤
JUCAAAAAA ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great job!!!
R. I. P. Ken
i like the part when he spins the tires.
RIP legend
Kek block are legend..🎉RIP from malaysia
Man this just hits different knowing we will never see another one. RIP Ken. You will be missed but never forgotten.
i do like the mechanical sound emphasis, but that vehicle did not sound good. the lack of combustion noise made the effects in the video less thrilling. that whining was like some unbearable audio segment from a Transformers movie. it was just artificial noise with some clinking in-between.
Спи спокойно Кен, ты навсегда в наших сердцах))))❤❤❤
The song at the end will forever make me shed a tear.
Кен блок умер😭
He maybe lost but he will never be forgotten.
This is what extreme leads to
Ngomong-ngomong Ken Block meninggal karena apa,dan kapan kejadiannya? Serius udah beberapa tahun belakangan aku penggemar dan mulai cari tau asal mula dia jadi super star x game😢😢😢
Великий Кен,спи спокойно😢
fk Mexico...  ususus
Не то это все, пилот слабоват
so sick so sad hes gone it sucks
Просто спасибо за эмоции Ты будешь вечно жить в наших сердцах F
Gone too soon. A legend. RIP KB
Un súper video me encanto también la parte donde sale ese Bocho tan monstruoso 😮
F
life is weird you know this guy ended up loosing his life to a snowmobile.
These cars need to shoot sparks and be much louder!
👍 Very Beautiful 👍
F
Rip ken we will never forget you❤
I just want to say, i know him today!! He is great!!
Never forgotten  Keep shredding tyres up there R.I.P.
Кен Блок🔥🙏🏾
geez those poor tires
it's a pity that there is no such a good man anymore Ken block was a professional in his field and not only hundreds of guys around the world tried to repeat what he was able to do, in memory of this great man, he personally opened the doors to the world of rally drift and other things, his video from jimhana on a mustang just drove me crazy at my young age 0 it is a pity that you are not with us ,
Да я бы на своей девятке :)
We all love you 43ver and iam sure i am going to miss you ❤️ rest in peace my legend ❣️🥹
shit car

The Block family is my favorite family ❤

Ну и скука смертная (((((((((( электросрань
RIP   The LEGEND.
My respect for Ken block🙏🏽  But even he knew that gas power vehicles were 10x much better
This man is every car game in real life 🙏🙏🙏🇯🇲
Serious though can someone say warehouse??   Electric stinks,    Can't wait to charge 5 hours even if an 1hr I'm so fucking annoyed due to the fact that electrical circuit isn't finished and the milk.system goes long  Right when gas engines get into the real age of tuning and diagnostic,  lol  Electric renewable is whats needed, in homes and crap ass ev cars
I just realized that’s the stadium from forza horizon 5
JUCA credits 😮❤
So dam. Boring 😴
Rip Ken   Elected is lame,  Ill.never own or drive one   If you ever worked inside of a warehouse, then this is it, a stupid fast moving forklift   Engine is more enjoyable,  modifiable,  and not setup stock shit, with batteries waiting to explode
RIP K.B. JUCA in the beetle: Priceless.
kinda want to know the price of the car lol
Это лучшее начало л❤ю❤б❤в❤и к АУДИ❤❤❤❤
I’d love to have been able to thank Ken for all of the things he’s done. Fucking rest man. Thank you so much.
It’s not perfect but that’s how life is; at the end of the day you just have to enjoy the ride to the fullest. I think Ken Block is the personification of this. Much love and RIP
I’m not crying.. you’re crying.
@Juca Crossover legendario #Eltuningnuncamuere
Wonder if his daughter will take over the gymkhana series, still gna miss him tho❤
I am surprised how stable this electric car is due to is low center of weight and good weight balance. It almost looks like it resisting to drifting.
Honor y gloria para Ken blok
love u ken wherever u are
nobody mentions the forward -reverse electric  burnout it the intro........... Epic.........
Crazy how someone you’ve never met can impact your life and make you so sad. Only people they shut down city’s to let rally around, R.I.P. Ken🤟🏻
Great.. Now I'm sad again. :')
Не то😢
There’s so much we haven’t seen with this collaboration. Yogi can only imagine what crazy ideas and thoughts Ken had. RIP KB43VER Ken you've been with us for almost a year now. And it feels like it was yesterday. We ALL miss you.
Rip Ken you were a true legend gone to soon 😢🤘🔙🔜🏁
ตำนานคนต่อไปเป็นใคร แต่คนนี้ตำนานยังอยู่ตลอดไป MISS YOU  [ KEN BLOCK ]
слабенько, очень слабенько... на форде было больше Экшена, больше шикарных кадров, а этот эффект стоп кадра и смены угла камеры - был восхитительный! а нынешняя версия...  РИП, Кен...
Ken was always the GOAT, and he still is forever.
el cameo de JUCA ;D
El Juca en el Bocho Jajajajaja que genial
Это просто ахуенно 😂
Full send at all times! The GOAT! KB43ver!

@jucaviapri vamoossssssss
Жалко легенду, дали тяжелую электричку, а он как новобранец себя чувствовал в ней))) Великий!
That thing sounds like a crazy RC car lol

Love You Ken <3
I can't be the only one that saw that it looked like he was in pain that whole time, none of the passion and joy we had become so used to with Ken. He will forever be missed and my condolences out to his whole family, all his friends, and all of us, his fans. Keep strong... KB43VER
The day i found out about Ken i was heartbroken. My uncle passed in February riding snowmobiles when he got caught in an avalanche. Truly unfortunate such great people have to leave us so soon.
KB43VER
Oh i see, its a shitty car with no upgrades but sticker bombed, makes sense

Однозначно лайк👍👍👍
El juca se la rifo ahi!!! Admirable.
Such an inspiration to so many and will live on thru his work and what he stood for.  I always could feel the passion/genuines thru all his videos.  Those who got to call him friend were blessed.  #kenblock4ever
I remember sitting in class in high school one day, watching the first Hoonicorn video. I instantly became a fan. KB 43ver.
Ken Block drove like crashing did not exist. RIP to a Legend 🕊🙏🏾
Why there is  no one exists to watch this?? The whole area is empty

С электродвигателем как-то не так. Мощь не так передаётся через видео
Дизлайк за электричку, лайк за Кена Блока) Весело было с ним в Dirt2 гонять)
Thanks Ken. I never forget you... I love your drive movie.

Goosebumps... just phenomenal stuff.  Don't know how anyone can ever fill your shoes....... RIP big man.

Rest in paradise Ken Block
I’d like to see Ken do pikes peak hill climb 🎉 Like for voting
Разве ему не хватало экстрима в работе? Зачем он поехал на этот горнолыжный склон???
Thank you for being one of the igniting factors in my fascination for cars and motorsports Ken. You will always be missed.  RIP Ken.
❤
Seriously this is TURD 💩
Electric SUCKS 💩
🇲🇽👏🏻🏎️🙌🏼🇲🇽
🇲🇽👏🏻🏎️🙌🏼🇲🇽
tire companies would own the world if all the drivers drove like this man.
WTF happened to Ken Bloc? 😮How did he die? 😢When the fuck did this go down 👇
RiP to THEE GOAT! With that said, this Jawn was so sick. HOWEVER, let’s be real, it’s just not even on the same level without hearing shit like blow off valves, spooling turbos, 1400hp supercharged v8’s just SCREAMING AND GROWLING while doing this shit.
I waited almost 2 weeks to watch this since it’ll be my last time getting that “the new Gymkhana dropped” feeling, RIP Ken #43ver
Ken block a man a driver forever a legend may his soul rest in peace and this gymkhana be the best for his send off until his daughter is ready to take the staff and continues his legacy...❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰
electric cars just doesn't tingle all of the senses. the driving and engineering is awesome but i dont enjoy electric car noises .
Legend!
May the legend rest in peace 🙏
Полезный, нескучный канал
Rest in power king 😢
It’s so sad, Ken did all these absolutely insane stunts that no one has ever dreamt of doing before, and then dies in a snowmobile accident on holiday, which is a relatively common activity compared to the stuff he normally does. He truly pioneered this section of car culture and was such an inspiration to so many. I’m devastated I will never see him drive again. I hope his family are doing ok ✌️RIP Ken Block
Ponele un globo en la rueda para que haga ruido al menos ..
We love ya Ken ❤🙄☹️
Would I dare say this sounds electric to watch
he really is and always will be the best at what he loved 43ver🤙
Legend!
Нужно сделать игру ...учиться так ездит  и назвать ее Кен блок ❤🎉😢😊
RIP to a legend always a masive fan of the videos couldnt wait for the new ideas u had crazy but fun to watch all the years 😢 now your hooning in heaven with paul walker and Colin mcrae ❤❤❤❤
Thank you for all ❤ i remember it forever in my life ❤
Rip hoon you still are and always will be one of the best wheelmen of our time. Godspeed 🏁
I miss him 😢
Can’t watch it no engine sound
Can’t watch it no engine sound
Ken found an even more effective way to wreck tires with the Electric torque.
Still can’t believe he’s gone. So wild. Rest easy dude
Rest In Peace.... ❤
The last ride.
😢😢😢😢❤❤❤
juca
If there's one thing I can tell you about Youtube is that Ken Block never dies
Street art.
Ken Block's idea of useful dashboard buttons included
Ken Block will always be an eternal land in this world !!!
I never imagined myself crying while watching a Hoonigan video..   You will always be missed, Ken.  #KB43VER
I very much love how Ken and the team got an electric car so they could make even more smoke then they could with a gas powered car.
Мы, ценители Вашего таланта, ценители и любители автоспорта, все безумно скучаем по Вам, Кен. Мир Вашему праху, Вы были лучшим...
Im not gonna lie. I got bored half way through. The electric car is so annoying to listen to and honestly the driving line was dumb. Kens driving is always entertaining but I understand why this company is failing now.
Rest in peace Ken. We'll never forget you.❤
Великий мужик 😢
Кен, тебя будет не хватать. Спасибо тебе за то, что привил любовь к автоспорту, к тюнингу и всему этому автомобильному безумию. С радостью буду пересматривать старые видео с твоим участием. Хулиган, верните нам бензиновые безумные авто проекты. Электро эра до боли скучна. Я думаю Кен бы со мной согласился. Не было на его лице той радости, что он когда то испытывал будучи за рулем переделанного Focusa, Fiesta или легендарного Ford Mustang :(
Всё таки бензиновый двигатель лучше
Juca en su vochito ❤🇲🇽
Wild how dude made a career out of making internet driving videos that are more impressive than any car scene from any movie.
Salut Ken block c'est Ahmed c'est moi le mec à la moto de cross jaune à l'époque on avait fais du slalom drift entre des tramways et d'autres obstacles c'est moi je suis la personne avec qui on s'était bien éclaté d'ailleurs il y très longtemps motos de jaune. Je suis français mais je vais te dire que je suis algérien en fête.
RIP! #43VER
Suck
❤❤❤
fuck this was some boring shit
Ese Jucaa🎉🎉🎉🎉
Does anyone know why he’s still shifting gears? Isn’t electric always automatic
Im not crying 😭😭😭 im just watering my cheeks 😭😭
Merci pour lui il manque
He's a  GOD !!!! R.I.P !!
Вот для чего должна быть электричка! Бешенный фан! HOOLIGAN )))))!!!!!
Τι να πώ για αυτόν τον κορυφαιο οδηγό -χειριστή ,πού θά μείνει αξέχαστος ,για εμενα είναι ο νουμερο 1 οδηγός σε αυτό που έκανε .....σ ευχαριστούμε φίλε Κέν ☺☺
🕯We will never forget... #KB43VER 🕯
Rest in peace the etiquette he’s got behind a wheel never will be forgotten. 🤯
Вечная память😔

Я бы посмотрел как Кен дрифтит у нас в России на семерочке хуниган жаль что такого уже и не будет, вечная память
Настоящий petrolhead. Надеюсь дочка превзойдет его  ...
вау
Гонщик хорош но не дает кайфа нет звука мотора выхлопа как будто детский игрушечный машинка
That machine sounds like a mythical banshee just flying through modern day cities like "Eeeeeeeeeeeeeee this is so exciting!!!"
Legends never die

He created a new genre in to world of racing, thank you Ken, you will always be in my heart as a legend, much respect 🙏🏽✨
✨😞 LEGEND 😞✨    🥰  RESPECT 🥰
we never got to see him use the signature button :/
Don't know what's crazier, the driving skills or the empty streets of mexico city
Ive always wondered if ken was like all other men when he goes to get groceries and if he would drift the shopping cart.  I miss this man
why this look fake
Que fregon era Ken block y maravillos videos en su memoria
Rip KB43EVER
Thank you, Ken
What Robin Williams was to comedy, Ken Block was to driving. RIP Ken.😥❤
Ken Block drove _THE FUTURE_ ....no-one quite like him! He was from another Space+Time. We follow in his footsteps to find _THE FUTURE_
Fuckin bullshit
this was definitely one of the best videos I've ever seen created with ken in it. From his legendary cars being in video games like forza horizon and forza motorsport. He will still be many people icons. he will be greatly missed and hopefully he is still doing what he loves up above all of us. I will miss seeing new content from him. #KB43ver
From 5:10 to 5:18 looks like Ken is in a jet cockpit
Legends never die.
I remember watching Gymkhana 7 on my 15th birthday the day it came out on YouTube. And immediately watching any Ken block video I could find afterwards. We miss you Ken! Your legend lives on! Hope you’re up there shredding rubber!
may you forever rest in paradise, shredding tires up there Ken
Rip you legend KB43

É bom. Ruim não é não 😑
Nunca había visto algo que me emocionara tanto en tan "pocos minutos". ¿Que se necesita para trabajar de esto?
JUCA 😈
Покойся с миром Кен, ты навсегда останешься в наших сердцах, как самый ахуенный и безбашенный тип!  Мы помним о тебе и любим тебя... 🥲🥲🥲
This car is truly outstanding
Сколько же комплектов резины и зарядок ушло на этот клип…
Хуита какая то. Как будто пацаны на жигах возле окея на пустой парковке крутят восьмерки.
The best ever
Rest in Peace KB43VER
Hard to believe he is gone. This is so great and hurts all at the same time. It does keep his memory alive and I hope they have a few more videos of Ken’s in the future.
RIP TO A LEGEND
What a LEGEND, he was the 1 OF 1 in the entire world 😞 may his soul rest in peace 🕊️🙏🏻
Leyenda 🤠🤙🏽
Changes everything in car community people were inspired to do the things that he did and rest in peace Ken 💙
RIP Ken
Very awesome.  And how cool does the car look.  Not sure whats up with the wonky colors on the helmet though.  And thank God he didn't hit any of that stuff at the Airport lol.  God bless and forgive Ken Block.  Love the 180 stunts too.
Still can't believe with all the crazy stuff he did a snowmobile took him out rest in peace gods speed
POV mom says you can push the shopping cart
🙏🙏🙏
the goat ! ♥
RIP KEN BLOCK
I cried like a child at the end of this video. Ken Block was and is an immense inspiration for me and influence on my outlook on life.  I’ll never forget watching his snapchats the day we lost him, he was taken too soon but has left an immense impact. These Hoonagin videos bring me peace. Thanks Hoonigan fam.
Thank you for sharing this Hoonigan Family. Seriously miss that PodRacing Fun having man. 😂that Audi sounds just like it came right out of Star Wars. Freaking amazing run that was.
When he came out in front of that bug you can see the look in his eyes like I might hit this pole  😂
вечная память Кен Блоку-уважение! реальный и главное суперский был тип!очень жаль что так ушел! он был лучшим среди американцев в своем стиле!
Thank you for this Ken, Scott, and the entire production team. Ken, you are missed.
KB43VER
♥Love Hoonigan ♥ Love ken Block  #KB43VER
Hearing and seeing Ken for the last time doing what he loves is so surreal. Forever in our hearts. Forever a legend in the automotive world. THANK YOU for inspiring all of us. KB43VER.
Thanks for everything you created. A more than meaningful legacy!
without that crazy engine sound, on gasoline, it doesn't have that charm. otherwise all respect for the whole team. Ken Block's goodbye!
Крутой мужик! Ты в сердцах поклонников!
Te echamos de menos Ken😢❤❤❤
R. I. P. Ken
Rest in Peace Ken,an absolute legend of a man.
R.I.P Ken  We love you,  you'll never be forgotten ♥️
I've been watching this since the early days. And Ken went out how he did...on a normal day. Don't worry about what's lost. But enjoy the moments of joy...thanks HOONIGAN  for this.
rest in peace

Man that was awesome I couldn't stop watching! I wish they did this with a gas car though.
I guess we all hear all the time when celebrities or famous ppl pass away, I am 42 years old it had never impacted me like losing Ken Block. I felt for the first time the pain of almost losing someone I knew. I have been watching him my entire life. To me, Ken Block was and I didn't even know it, someone very very special. I will miss you, Ken.
te voy a extrar tanto... gracias por todo amigo, vuela aalto
Rest in peace ken truly the greatest daredevil of my time!! Will miss these videos!
Nothing like petrol power! Ken Block was amazing!
quedas para la historia como  el piloto mas loco he increible  nadie nunca llegara a poder hacer lo mismo
Thanks ken block you will be missed
I have avoided watching this  and it's just as hard as i imagined
RIP KB and Hoonigan ❤️
Cant believe hes gone RIP
Drifting in CDMX? something only Hoonigan could make possible, thanks for choosing us for this great video! 🖤🖤
LEGEND
KEN-BLOCK43VER 😍😍😍🤧
Rip Ken block
It’s not the same without a gas engine
Grande ken block que descanse en paz 🙌
He left us just in time to avoid driving all this electric shit non sense. Where are the petrol engines?
THANK YOU HOONIGAN , THANK YOU KEN !
Acredito que nunca mais veremos uma lenda no drift igual o Block.... simplesmente insano dmais no que fazia que chega arrepiar assistir ele. Eterno Block 43

О нет, только не электро (((
Звук электрички просто ужасен.
What just happened his front wheels were going backwards his back wheels going forward how do u do that
Ken block’s last dance 🤟🏼! Viva México!!!🇲🇽
Спасибо тебе, Мастер, что был!!! Любим и помним!!! Ты был лучший!!! С любовью из России!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
I don't understand why is he depicted so much in Youtube videos as if it was a really good rally pilot. He never didi anything remarquable in rallies, his best result was 7th (once), he didn't even won the US rally competition.  It was a mediocre pilot.
You will be missed😢what a send off wideo Sir 🙏😢
Truley sensational what a legend. Definitely spinning wheels somewhere up there ❤❤
4:39 I rewatched this part 20 plus times. Ken was in a league of his own and an continual inspiration to everyone around the world. He was just a good dude that had a passion for living life to the fullest. #43VER 🏁🏁
We will miss you KEN BLOCK, You still being the best, i think that no body can do it like you did, Love you KEN 🥲🥹😭💔💎 Dominican's 🇩🇴Say HI   to THE BEST DRIVER on EARTH
the best man in the earth that drives a car like this and on the other hand we have "Ken Block" JUST KIDDING, both ( Ken Block and JUCA ) are the best on their area "THE BOSSES" 🫡
Hats off to this historic man may you live on through all you gave to this world. 😢
Ken thank you for everything you did you are missed!
the world is a little less without him.
гидотно виглядає......
Rip❤
Rest in peace crazy boy! You will be remembered forever
Очень тяжёлое и резина ппц какая
shieee I thoutgh he didnt die for a sec there
Fue el mejor  en este mundo  motor  gracias  men
Epic
Eterno Ken Block 😢🕊️❤
This video broke my heart, but give me the message "don't slow down"
They shoulda gotten rid of the "kmh" so people wouldn't know he's actually not going very fast.
Ken we miss you
is the first time i cry during a video nobody know but gymkhana video save my live and make me love live and car i just wante to says thank you to hoonigan and ken for that
I started Watching this while at work and had to stop, 😢 lol i will Continue to watch again at home when is Socially ok To Cry on a Corner. #KB43ver!
Legend!
#KB43ver ❤❤❤
They should do a final video/tribute called Gymkhana: Generations where his kids and wife do a Gymkhana style video
Plasmado para la historia el @juca #JUCA FELICIDADES 🎉
Thank you, Ken. It was good to see one last Hoon.
that moment when he over did it and it worked out was awesome you can see the way he reacted when he went around the bug
KB43VER
RIP bro
....  The last Dance  ....
This needs way more likes. Let's do better for Ken!
Rest in peace champ

Это мили?
⚡️❤️‍🔥KEN
Thanks for all Ken!! 😢
We always remember you Ken Block 🕊️r.i.p
What a Legend... These movies are badass! 🔥
The Legend ❤❤
Man it took me a while to finally click on this. I get sad still. But this had me smiling the whole time from ear to ear. An amazing car and an amazing driver. Idk what it was exactly about ken but I loved that guy. I guess in the end I'm happy to at least got to witness his awesomness and thanks to the team for that. To the family and friends my deepest condolences. RIP Ken Block.
Last Ken
That airport part gives me vibes from the terminal velocity pack from Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012 when I was driving and drifting with the Porsche 918 Spyder at the airport.
3:29 whats break?
Hmm der Abspann ist das beste.... dieses elektro gejaule ist unerträglich 😢 danke für die stets genialen Gymkhanas❤ ruhe in Frieden Ken❤
oh man miss that guy
Drive an electric car they said. It's quieter they said. 🙂
BIEN 👍🏻 EXCELENTE COMO SIEMPRE
Leyenda!   Especial ver a Juca
Keep drifting higher Ken...
wonderful amazing video
Don't think I have ever seen him struggle so much to keep a car in line. He is used to managing turbo which are problematic enough for precision driving but that EV is giving him hell still. Hoping to see it get some much needed fine tuning.
Cuantos vieron el videos para ver la aparición de @juca también... grande ken... Q.E.P.D. LEYENDA...!!!
Broche de oro en Mexico. Sin duda la leyenda del drift siempre permanecerá en nuestros corazones…. Y que prron que un entusiasta del drift y tuning haya salido en tu video. @juca….. KENB43VER
It makes me sad that we will never see him drive in a car anymore .but I'm happy at the same time his daughter is carrying on his legacy and all the guys at hoonigan❤
His insane accuracy and precision
RIP KEN Legend forever
❤❤❤
Legend!!! 🏆
I need mustang again please, her sound of roaring engine 😍
Para mí gusto. No tiene emoción como el Ford Mustang
😂😢
Glad they cut out the tyre changes 😂 Legend
Jucaaaa🎉
Tu nous manques tellement ken block 😢 tu resteras a tout jamais dans notre cœur
MI BUEN JUCAAAAAAAAAAA, un ejemplo a seguir
RIP to the king of car stunts.
Ken its a live 😮😮
F
No  volverá a existir alguien asi , suerte haberlo disfrutado ✌️
The two things that I got from this are: 1) When torque and power are maxed, grip or the lack of it becomes your bomber 1 enemy. (OMG What is even that ? In order to break make a 180 and floor it, till it starts going in the right direction 😮 !?; 2) Ken is a Legendary Sacred Monster. RIP Ken, I believe you are now in the Eternal fields of racing, competing for fun with the Valkyries and such.
Big, sad RC...  ... and Ken Block, True Legend.
Another great addition to series. These videos have inspired me and many others to chase dreams and do what makes you happy. Thanks for just being you Ken. #KB43VER
Danke für dieses tolle Video. Trotz der Tragödie habe ich mich beim Anschauen des Videos immer wieder beim grinsen erwischt. Was für eine Maschine... Wir vermissen dich. KB4EVER
Damn man, I miss you! Buy i guess they start to pick the best flowers first afterall! Take care everyone!
The Goat
My Rc car can do that!! RIP block you are the goat
RIP Legend.
I feel this was like Ken's life, way too short. #KB43VER

НА ЭЛЕКТРИЧКЕ-НЕ ТО!СПАСИБО ЗА ТВОРЧЕСТВО!
Thank you Ken for being the reason I love cars the way I do, you're an absolute legend and you always will be❤❤❤ #kb43ver
So würde man wesentlich mehr E-Autos verkaufen ^^ Ken Block, unvergessen!
Crying while watching. Miss 43. Live on forever in our hearts KB43VR
I guess Ken wasn't gonna be too sad about ev's. Should've lived to do a flying car gymkhana.
❤❤❤❤❤❤legend will always be missed what a true badass in  car

Кен на всегда останется и в русских сердцах!
Ride In Paradise Legend… we miss you.. 🌹🏎️

We are so grateful for what ken did for the Motorsports community it will live on through hid daughter LIA and everyone at hoonigan
Grande Ken! Eres el mejor allí donde estés. La pena de este último vídeo, no hay sonido de motor...😢 no pude terminarlo. Lastima...
My inspiration KB43 RIP .  Hoonitron have an electric gear?
This Audi's insane. I recently re-watched all the Gymkhana videos and I love them all (Dubai and San Francisco being my favorites). And Ken will always be an absolute legend!
Rip  kenblock
KB, you'll be missed (the lagos rally will miss you even more :) ), both the electrickhana  are cool, but, IMHO, all others are way more fun, better produced and way more hardcore than this. Thanks!
The fact that the video game The Crew Motorfest honored Ken Block by adding the Hoonigan Playlist and this car along with the Mustang really showes how many lives Ken Block and the team touched
its so sad!
Как можно смотреть электро дрифт, досмотрел просто из за Кена 😢
I watching Ken's Gymkhana since he drives Subaru impreza  I was a kid then  I always wanted to see him in my adult life... But vids will stay forever  Love you Ken, see you on the other side [*]
LOVE IT. What a guy 🙌🏻
Thank you for this <3 RIP Ken
Gracias... Hasta allá!  Aún recuerdo saludar a su equipo en una salida que tomaban en perinorte....
All the love. Can't watch it yet
Always ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Miss you Ken. RIP brotha.
ЛЕГЕНДА
Ken will and always will be the GOAT
Audi one love ❤
Gracias amigo! Te despides como los grandes!
We need  more backstage classic movies from making. Please 😢
I watched it because Ken Block is Fing awesome  but God I wish his last video wasn't with a EV it feels like it's missing so much, the gear shits and pops with fire...... Oh well, still a amazing driver and a even better person. You will be missed!!!!
People perish. Memories don’t! We should all hold these videos very close. We were always apart of history!!!! We miss you Ken. Forever The Head Hoonigan In Charge
Интересно, сколько раз зарядил ауди пока сняли весь ролик?
jucaaaa
Legendary Human, RIP dude.

Two saddest moments in life, my dog passing and Ken doing the same. Both were legends performing extraordinary tasks on the daily
❤#kb43ver the  Legend in is style 💪🏽impossible to forget it🙏🏽!!!R.I.P
Such a Shame that out of everything he did. A snowmobile is what took him out.
Shoutout to Scotto for keeping the hoonigan and gymkhana spirit alive. The tribute at the end is everything.
4:50 most epic shot ever. RIP KB <3
The last rip-a-roo, sounds like a spaceship, still love motors but that sound is good. RIP buddy
Gonna be miss 43 forever ❤ I started watching Ken and knowing him when I came across gymkhana 3 and the rest is history rest in paradise
I didn’t know they made tires with that much tire in em Jesus
El juca es el del vocho
This ending credits brought a tear to my eye, #KB43VER
About 8:10 where I started to choke up. There was - and will never be anyone quite like him. God damn. Rest in Peace.
There credits are... pure memories. We will miss you Ken. The best 43ever
Rest in Peace Ken, you‘ll be badly missed
Por siempre en nuestros corazones ❤
This is hard to watch..

земля теб пухом безумный гонщик! больше не кто не сможет нас так радовать как ты  ((((
Максимально крутой пилот! Спи спокойно
Great to see KB43 doing what he loved and for us to get to watch his skill and crazy stunts. Not gonna lie Gymkhana 7 in LA was my favorite but damn can he wheel those cars! RIP KB43
i remember how cool he was first time seeing him do all these stunts
what an awful "sound" has the electric car.........
amazing video goodbye ken block
What a beauty, an amazing driver, we’ll miss u 43ver ken

so sad.. RIP LEGEND!
RIP Legend ! U will be missed 43ver !❤ #kb43ver
sedih rasanya nonton ini, but thankyou! for the entertain! #KB43VER
From an Aussie fan, Fucking beautiful, NOT sorry for the language, and if anyone here doesn't like it, then here is another Aussie saying, drink a cup of cement and harden the fuck up, peace out and love ya Ken, same with the rest of ya, and if i don't see ya in the afterlife, then GOD don't exist (as i thought) and we all just bite the dust 🤣
Это было потрясающе спи спокойно Кен!💔
Best EVER!
Big Ken, Big Hoonigan. Grande Juca. Thanks. Los sueños pueden cumplirse.  Contento de haber recordado tantas Gymkhanas.  El Tuning Nunca Muere ❤  JUCNIGAN
Без звуков мотора и трансмиссии выглядит как гонки роботов-пылесосов.
#KB43VER man this guy is being missed!! 🥲
Reportense los que vienen aca x ken y el bocho de juca
Très bel hommage pour KB43  le Roi des fous du volant... Merci pour cette vidéo... une pensée  à lui ! Existe t'il un dvd (blue ray) ou un coffret, regroupant toutes ses vidéos de drift et jymcana ? J'aimerais bien ces exploits dans ma collection, pour en faire profiter le plus grand nombre autour de moi y compris mes proches et les générations avenir de ma famille ?
ive always loved that he was never onesided anything, he just loved driving, not a truck guy, not a hypercar guy, ev or ice guy. just a car guy in general. gonna miss him
Which video game is this the trailer for please? :D
😢 I miss you ken
Rest in Peace DK
If anyone has not seen the video of Ken's little girl piloting the Hoonapig up Pikes Peek to finish the run that he was not able to do from mechanical issues the year before, you absolutely must look it up and watch it!!! Some one is cutting onions at the end though for sure, so just be prepared for that. Hopefully you go and see it next if you haven't seen it already you won't be disappointed as always!!
so shit so fast man, but the sound is so shit... shame really. waste his last is in this, r.i.p tho
Очень жаль что ушел такой яркий человек из авто культуры... Кен был человеком которому предлогают безумную идею, а он уже думает на какой бы шасси ее реализовать !😅  Спи спокойно брат ❤
RIP Ken, why did he die??? 😢❤ Legend.. 🕊️
Легенда♥

I grew up watching this man absolutely abuse tires it still hasnt sunk in that this was his last. Rest in Peace Ken 43 forever!

Big Ken Block, thanks for México 🎉
God bless Ken Block. That man could drive though.
What a legend i still cant believe Ken is gone 😢
RIP Ken, the legend
JUCA 4:07
Just cuz he’s not here doesn’t mean a thing  He’s still sliding sideways wherever he is
Never had the chance to go and event and meet you Ken but have been a big fan, hope one day ask your daughter an autograph and tell her how much you mean and her to the auto sport community, let’s go!! I bet you are making donuts in heaven and making everybody happy.
El juca

Quien después del vídeo de juca?? :(
Hard to believe I've been watching these since I was a kid. Ken was an absolute legend. Thank you Brian and team for giving us one more
Lo más hermoso  su nave del juca
ken block  sigue brillando en el cielo
❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥 Let’s see Hoonitron vs Plaid. The world misses you, Ken. A life cut too short.
RIP you fucking legend!
Venimos por jucaa!!!
LEGEND NEVER DIED
Hyperdrive..!
These are happy tears! Ken you were truly an amazing driver and an inspiration to everyone. The bar you set will stand 43ver!
😢 god I miss ken 💔
Does anyone else see that he was drifting on a call of duty map when he went to the airport? 7:00
😮😮kb43ver❤
Min 2:45 no es donde juca tenia el taller?
Viva México cabrones!!! Ken Block#1
I didn't want to watch this because I didn't want to cry watching. So glad i got round to watching. He will forever be missed forever changed car culture and was always an idol. So glad to see Lia taking the torch ❤
Amazing vidio💯💯
He was my idol from the start of the dirt2 he is the only reason I got into rallying, the only reason why I still love subies I even tried to film my own gymkhana during quarantine on fh4. He will be missed until the end of time. Travis Pastrana is a bad replacement and every time he has a gymkhana film he looks scared this legend doesn't. #KB43VER
43ver a Legend!
he is the most skilled driver to ever exist. he will be for 43ver missed.
Fantastic video, thank you very much for producing and sharing these. Thank you for everything Ken!
RIP gymkana"s GOD! well Miss U 4EVER!
Cool car they should put the audi in cyberpunk 2077
super awesome!
Damn, end of an era
Love you ken❤❤
❤ RIP 🏎️ 💨
😮 This VW its a legend!  Bien hecho JUCA, lo lograste ❤
Electrical cars like a toys sounds. Can't look this seriously
4:07 JUCA
REST IN PEACE KEN. MY BROTHER RECEIVED A LOT OF INSPIRATION AND HOPE FROM YOU, HE LOVED YOU VERY MUCH, AND WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS, HE WAS VERY SORRY. MY BROTHER WAS A CANCER PATIENT AND HE PASSED AWAY 3 MONTHS AFTER YOUR DEATH. I HOPE YOU KNOW AND TALK TO YOU.<3<3
I think I speak for everyone when I say this, I thought there wouldn’t be any more videos of Ken. Almost made me cry seeing this. Thank you HOONIGAN for sharing Ken having one last badass shred. RIP43 forever a legend.
THE ASMR level is crazy in these videos, no music, no bullshit, the tires and motors, love it, electric and all. Crazy quality, and RIP legend
So boring😕
À jamais dans mes souvenirs tu était toute mon enfance et ma passion pour la puissance des voiture #ken43 à jamais ❤️😞
The pure skill that Ken had was unmatched. Loss of a great driver, great man, great role model and great father. Rest in peace.
Me playing scalextric against my dad:
You could be gone tommorow, or 5 minutes from now. Never forget that.
It’s bittersweet watching this. Incredible talent, but it’s utterly irrelevant compared to his loss.
Hola, @juca!
UuuuaaaaaUUUU❤
143 43
and then, Hefest got, this run
Rip Ken Block
Love Ken block but can't watch that RC going around, yikes my ears.   RIP Ken, I know you are still a petrol head at heart :-)
Que buen JUCA 🎉  por siempre Ken block ❤
I do miss vroom vroom sound
Miss you
43ver we miss you😢 rest in peace legend 🔥🥺❤️
I never tought that I will cry on a gymkhana… #KB43VER
We miss you bro.....😞
I genuinely miss him and i never met him,he was a n absolutely legend,i am sure he had ten times a better life than most of us in a short time but he was taken away way too early ,very very sad.i miss ken in the flame throwing petrol cars of old
Its so far beyond me how something like that is even humanly possible. Crazy video. crazy man. Rest in Peace..
Great video and great ending. I wish it didn't really have to be over. Rip Ken Block, nobody ever has done it like you!
Great driver live forever Ken Block. Electric cars just sounds like kitchen grinder horrible.
Esse é comentário brasileiro que você procura.
@hoonigan It would be really great if you made a documentary about Ken Block's years with you.
man, i don't think anyone will ever match the sheer talent and precision that ken block had, he literally had to be perfect for all his stunts, love u ken block and miss you like crazy man u are a legend.
What an amazing send off to Ken's Gymkhana series.... He is working up there now, creating the real clouds just like he used to do down here with his videos. Eager to see Lia shred the next Gymkhana, that'll be emotional.
I grew up watching KB racing in rally and he was always had me on the edge of my seat! His driving abilities were so great and so unique that he always stood out amongst his rivals!  Spotlighted in all gymkhana videos,his talents knew no boundaries! I can't wait to see what great automotive achievements Lia makes,i love that she chose to carry on her father's epic legacy! Kb4everloved
4:07 Juca is here
Hasta siempre, M A E S T R O!!!🇲🇽
To Ken, rest in peace, and to all the Hoonigan men and women who create one of the best ways to consume car porn in the history of automotive filming making. It’s really inspirational on so many levels and I appreciate everything you all do, but I’m not alone.  Please keep putting it out there, you have a huge audience and fan base and have become a household name through everyone’s diligence to create something the fans really enjoy! Love and respect!❤
@jucaviapri felicidades!!
RIP Ken, forever loved.
RIP Great guy!
Amazing video. Everyone who knows Mexico City understand the huge effort behind emptying many parts of the city where the stunts were filmed, with the exception of the AIFA airport which is always empty
KB43VER🇺🇸
RIP
tqm Ken
Dang!!! I love this. Miss you Ken. Great driver. 🖤
Вечная память❤‍🩹
ken block is a fucking legend, i am just sad to see the electric as i think everyone can feel there was no soul of the car.
I love Ken, but this (Electric) car is disgusting, we want the roaring effect!
Is amazing, is perfect, is simply Ken block #43ever ❤
4:08 excelente trabajo 🤌🏽 Si se quiere se puede 🤙🏽
@FitraEri #FitraEri
Best to ever do it. Much respect. RIP Ken Block 43VER!!!
Aparece el bochitooo
wtf ken! <3 <3 <3
Man this made my day! Fo43ver ❤
Amazing driving as usual. Sorry, just can’t get behind the electric whine though. Some things are better with ICE. Tired of this virtue signaling across Motorsport.
You are missed Ken. Much love to you and your family. That's one big RC car... take that thing to heaven.
Один на миллион! Просто— лучший!  «Инна лилляхи ва инна иляйхи раджиун» ☝🏼
A great driver and a wunderfull person , ken your going to be mised rip 🥲🙏👊

Miss him, miss the sound
Ken Block er war der Größte  aller Zeiten Weir Werten dich in Erinnerung Behalten  und auch das Diem War Spitze 👍
Never did I think we'd run out of Ken Block Hoonigan videos. I feel like all I can do now is go back to the start of his videos and hit replay..
My condolences to Lia, the Hoonigans crew and beyond...
legend forever
As cool as he was, As cool as a high powered AWD car is.. this EV trend is boring AF.
R.I.P gohst driver
Great respect to Ken.  But as much wonderful driving it is as mush incredibly boring to watch for electric car
Legend! Rest in peace, Mr Block!  There are two things in this video making me sad - the fact that we lost one of the greatest drivers of modern and that wheeeeening rice cooker sound:'(
I'm here sobbing because of the ending. Man, you don't realize how short life is.
This would be a cool video game concept.  😮
Juca 👌👍👏🇲🇽
Противная хня вой эл. двигателя и визг шин

Ken block #1
Love it
Its beautiful but we miss the angry sound of engine
Это уже не то😢
Ken block🥹🥀
You And Paul Walker Are The Best!!!!
Though my origin state is in a silent war... Mexico will forever love Ken Block and what he brought to the automotive world in Mexico! Much love from a descendant of the Jalisco State! 🇲🇽 #KB43VER
I did this on forza horizon once
what is keeping the battery from melting on this car?  How many seconds of WOT can it drive for on a charge? what do the feeder cables to the motor/motors even look like?! are they solid gold?  is there a making of for the car? does it "really" have gears or are these torque settings?   I have so many technical questions...
Thank you Hoonigan team. It's been the right amount of time to release this as a great tribute and send-off. I'll be interested to see where Hoonigan goes in the future. and of course rest in peace Ken.
Ken, you were an absolute legend!  You will be remembered for generations to come.
Había estado esperando este video por mucho tiempo 😢 We miss you 43 🥺🥺 KB43ver 🙏🙏
Miss you Ken
TY Xgames u make me know how good this guy
REST EASY CHAMP! Your driving always gave me goosebumps. I'll always and forever be a fan.

Amazing, there are only a handful of people in the world that have vehicle control like this and #43 was at the top of that short list.  RIP Ken, you are missed.
Loved getting this chance to see Ken happy doing what he loves one last time. Ill miss that man blessing us with his genius and skill forever. RIP Ken gymkhana with the angels brother.
R.I.P. DK <3
I’m just now finding out that Ken Block is no longer with us….. f$#% man 😕  It’s happening too often that we lose iconic figures and this one just hits hard.
R.I.P you will forever be missed 😢by many you brought us a whole new sport or how to driver insanely wild and we loved it...much love to his fam ...keep it alive Lia Block...mad respect to her as well
Best in forever ❤️
RIP but I’m not sure everyone was thrilled about their city being shut down and their roads and landmarks being defiled with tyre marks even if this was legendary.
Очень круто
So missed, KB43VER RIP43
Amazing as always 😢
Nmmmmms, Es una vrg ese vato alch.
Why am I so emotional! Damn I miss that guy!
Ken ! You was Best of the Best. Ukraine will miss for you ! Sad, that Stars - go from us so early.
I’ve never felt like crying watching anything EVER but this is the closest to getting me KB 43ver
I know its hard for his family to watch this but he did what he loved and made alot of people happy!!!❤❤❤
Gracias!! Para mi el mejor piloto!! Grande Block!!!❤ #43
As a father I could only think of his daughter trough the whole video... and how was it to have such an incredibly cool dad, and what a huge miss he'll always be for her, God bless you sweet little miss your pops will be 4ever your speedy Guardian Angel <3
KB43VER
Thank you Ken and Hoonigan team for everything you've done. This last permormance was hard to watch without tearing up. This National Treasure did so much for the sport and entire community, dare I say, world. Block family, I wish there were more I could do besides say I'm sorry for your loss. I only know Ken from a fan stand point but he seemed like one of the greatest people to be able to know. May his legacy and spirit live on. Rip Ken Block #KB43ver
RIP KB 🙏
Ahuevooooo mi @juca
That same look of absolutely legendary confidence lives on in his daughter's eyes. #KB4EVER
RIP ken block you will be missed
el juca .😆😆
Legend🎉😢❤😮
RIP brother!   There are only a scant few people who can drive like you at this level..!    Thoughts and prayers still for all of Ken's family and friends - especially his Daughter...
Miss you Ken. You were the greatest
Damn. What is there to say? Bittersweet video. We got to watch our boy give it his all like he always does. One last time. He lived one hell of a life. It’s nice to see him in his element and happy. He had a good life. He got to make his hobby his career, friends that loved him, and a wonderful family. May he rest in peac….nah who am I kidding, no way Ken is resting up there. Few people know this but clouds are actually formed by Ken Block drifting in Heaven.
Amazing, guys. Means a lot for this country to have been blessed by his driving, long live his legacy. And also thank you Scotto and everyone else behind the scenes. #43forever
love u ken, really trank you❤
ken Block's for ever 43!!
I believe Ken faked his death
Ken awesome like always, Jucas Beetle!!!.
The best driver of all time ! Fuckin legend!
The only EV that’s battery charge last longer than the tires.
Rip Legend , you'll be missed but never forgotten .
No me gusta absolutamente nada el coche eléctrico el sonido no me motiva nada.
Its been an wholesome jorney and Iam glad i vitnesed it from the start to the end. My pairs of DC shoes are still in my memory and same goes for his incedible talent to drive anything that has 4 wheels from skatebnoard, to a 1500kw pickup RIP L
Block Forever!!!!!!!
GTA VI Reasesed ?????????????? Hell yeah...
Is gone not forgotten RIP 43
The driver of a generation, inspired so many to love the world of motorsports and gave us the most insane memories with his stunts and videos. Thank you Ken for your time here, Rest Well!

Grande juca con el vochooo

Ken is a legend. But honestly I can't stop thinking of RC cars with the stunts in the electric car...
Fuck Electric. RIP LEGEND.
Best of the best. Rest in peace legend. ❤ #kb43ver
God this car is so insane. And his driving is so, amazing. Miss him already.
Legend ❤
senden daha iyisi gelir mi kral sanmam.
Man... I still can't get behind electric. I just heard an R/C car running all over Mexico City. lol RIP Ken. What an incredible talent.
The car is georgeus
Can't believe he is not here anymore... <3
the noise of electric cars is horrible... Thanks Ken
This Great Man will forever be in our hearts🙏🙏🙏
but the sound  😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Imagine having all that power at your finger tips like that. Hes driving it around like its a Hot Wheels. What a driver Ken was.
True Legend ❤Rip 43❤😢
I like the smell of the rubber in the morning !!!!!🤠
🕊️
The G.O.A.T for sure ❤🙏😥
Its like the man from upstairs had a remote to the the car and said lets do one more Ken.
KB43ver!
RIP Ken, you're  LEGEND.
We miss you ken people everywhere
Ken Block was a legend. And legends never truly die. <3
Opanowanie samochodu, maestro! Ale dźwięk który wydaje ten pojazd to mnie boli głowa po minucie oglądania tego filmu... Samochód najlepiej brzmi gdy gary dudnią 😎, a nie jakby zabawkowy samochodzik sie wysilał...
🤘🤘🤘🤘
KB 43ver😢❤
Beautiful.
RIP Legend!
TRULY MISS THIS GUY AND HIS ONE OF A KIND MAD DRIVING SKILLS.... R.I.P KEN BLOCK YOU ARE GONNA BE IMMORTAL IN OUR HEARTS AND MEMORIES ❤❤❤
RIP Ken Block, Legend of Motorsport! This video doesn't come close to any Gymkhana video with an IC engine. Electric is the future for road cars but not Motorsport, fans want the noise and brutality of an IC engine. Audi - Take Heed.
Dont slow down
An inspiration. An amazing driver. A amazing man. A true role model.   You, your content, and Hoonigan under your leadership will be immensely missed Ken Block. Rest Easy!
Mercedes and bmw leave the chat  🤣
KB 43VER 💙💙💙
He was taken by God to ride the clouds steeply with him.
We miss you #KB4EV3R

It is very sad you are gone Ken. The electric car is Lame though. RIP

Sound like RC car
Extremely talented
That noise is upsetting
⚡🎶🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Os fãs do Brasil sonhavam em um dia o Ken Block aceitasse o desafio de descer a Serra do Rio do Rastro em Santa Catarina. WE NEVER FORGET YOU, KEN BLOCK!
Стареет, скучновато...😂
What an Absolute Legend.
RIP Ken Block. I pray peace and rest for his family!
Legenda jako je Ken Block nikdy neumře v našich srdcích žije dál ❤️
Que genial ver qué le dieron oportunidad de salir a unos de los mejores tuneros de México en ese vídeo y que fué mera casualidad ✌🏻
drove the car so hard, he broke the asphalt.  You'll always be remembered for everything you did.  We will still look up to you!  Rest in peace!
GREAT <3
R.I.P ken :(...how many cameras destroyed in this movie? 20? by plastic and glass pieces :D
#Legend  RIP
This really hit hard RIP Ken you were literally Unfuckwitable 🔥
Gonna be missed by us all, you have truly left your mark on this planet and will never be forgotten.  #KB43VER
Без ДВС это уже не то…
Légende never Die ❤😢🕊️
I'm sure that Audi S1 AWD 2-door sports car is going straight into production any day now 😏
THE GOAT👑
Why am I crying just starting watching a car video. Ken was taken way too soon. What a fucking Legend of a man.
Красавчик
Sounds like my RC car))
Ken Block, you changed everyone in the world from your legendary drifting, I will recreate one of your runs in memory of you. #KenBlock43ver
RIP  #KB43EVER
Rest in peace, legend!
Rest in peace man💚 You`ll live forever in our hearts!
Super .....
Gone but never forgotten! Rest In Paradise Legend! #KB43VER
RIP Ken!
Ahh man, this brought tears to my eyes. This guy was an idol for me and my friends growing up, I still can't believe he's gone. It's crazy how someone passing that you've never even met can affect you so much. I feel for his family and the teams that supported him, can't imagine how hard that must have been. He lives through his daughter now, and she's badass! His legacy is far from over.  Also, I miss the hoonicorn mustang, the ev's just don't do it like combustion does.
Thanks Hoonigan.  My eyes are opened to Ken Block.  A shout out to the Cyberpunk Hoon & the S1, my favourite not real and real cars.
F
RIP LEGEND
Terrible. Really terrible. I do the same thing with the vacuum in my house.
fly high ken block 😊😊
👏👏👏👏👏
What a beast of a car
Riposa in pace Ken.  ❤Sei grande❤
BIG RCcar
#KB43VER❤️
RIP Legend. I remember watching first Gymkhanas back in high school. The internet was different back then, this was always the highest Netflix level production value content. Ken Block is a man that cannot be limited by our boundaries; he created his version of Gymkhana from scratch and redefined the genre. He rode the coolest cars, at the fastest speeds, at the craziest locations and did it sideways. Mad respect from Kazakhstan, king ♥
ありがとう。ケン ブロック🇯🇵
Our Children will never know this guy for real 😢
Dziwnie się to ogląda bez warkotu silnika
I won't buy a used car from them.
rip
RIP Ken Block
Grande Jucaaaaaa que se quede inmortalizado ese logro
What a legend, you are missed
Where 3l turbo?
Realizing his impact on motor sports is bigger than almost anyone else. Was truly different than the rest. One of the best along Travis, Dale, Senna, Michael—but he made an impact by inspiring others more than anyone
Allright some one has to create an epic game in remembrances of Ken Block fr! Until then guess this dreamers gonna start soupin up my charger Hoonigan style haha
The and, R.I.P Ken blook😢
i cried
Rest in peace guy. Growing up iv always wanted to be able to drive like Ken block.... playing need for speeds and all that man.... dreams that you have conquered our friend..... What I'd pay to go learn to drive like Ken block.... R.I.P....😢
RIP
Вечная память Кен 😢
Legend!!!
Ken Rocks! Mark skier friend from Tahoe who knew you was sad to hear the news. Everyone has positive things to say about Ken. Greatly missed. 🤟🏼🤙🏼
RIP to a legend
43ver😇
Chelsea Denofa should be the next in line for this!!!
Is the color temp accurate and can you change it?
AMAZING DRIVER AND DRIVING!  Fuck electric! prove to me the future! ok wrong!
His 2012 video was the very first video I watched from Ken Block. I became an instant fan ever since, I even got a ford fiesta when I had my job. 😁
Так то жаль парня. Молодой еще был
People see clouds, I like to think it Ken block drifting up there. RIP GOAT 🙌🏼
Cool
Какое же унылое говно.  Дайте ему нормальный автомобиль!
Que mmda, es aca en CuajisYork CDMX!!
Please combustion engine!!!! No fun
I regularly think about Ken. The same as i think about Colin McRae & others. They really meant a lot to me & made mine & millions of other lives better.
Miss you man♥️♥️♥️
the legendary ken
Muchos concuerdan en que si hace falta el sonido del motorzon para sentir esa derenalina 😢 pero en fin uno de los mejores esperemos las rutas de su niña...
When I was around 14 my family wanted to plan a trip and I was able to give my input. Where else to go but park city to hopefully run into ken somewhere out and about. That's exactly what we did and although I never was able to meet him in the flesh, even being in the town he called home got me beyond excited and is still a very fond memory. Heck even the first car I had to pay for myself would be a 2008 STI influenced directly by him. This man was beyond an inspiration and a symbol to so many. Bittersweet to be seeing the last gymkhana he will be a part of but to see the growth from the first episode is truly insane. I'm forever thankful for the kind person he was and hopefully my dreams of meeting him will still happen one day. I know he left us doing one of the many things he loved but his passing still feels different then most. Thank you for giving us one last episode and of course another smile or two. I hope to see Lia carry the torch in the future and of course RIP Ken. #KB43ver
Rest in pistons KB43 👣❤️
Bro is living the GTA V life. Drifting on the streets & casually making donuts at the airport. lol
How thick are those tires! ?!
Genial crecí viendo tus videos
*Miss you Ken..*
4:21 Dude closed his eyes like he was about to crash then does a badass 180 drift transiton. What a legend!
El verdadero DK! Un orgullo que haya estado en tierras mexicanas, descansa en paz leyenda.
Undeniable talent who will be forever missed.... That Hoonitron however while obviously capable, sounds fucking awful. Long live combustion engines.
Ken Block ya es méxicano y siempre en nuestros corazones, 😢
Zzzzzzzz bullshit.
THANK YOU KEN BLOCK
Much respect to you. The legend. KB43. We will miss you  1:30 @ Santa Fe 3:30 @ Polanco 4:30 @ San Jeronimo 5:30 @ AIFA
I think the next Fast and Furious should be an Electric Car Race. And Ken Block should make an appearance.
Legendary ❤❤❤🙏🙏
Fuck me I got goosebumps from those credits
Imagine what he and Audi could have done..
I love the Hoonicorn, but that Audi is a beast. RIP Ken, a true giant
The sound of a V8 is so much better.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I was shocked to by his passing, glad we could get one more video #KB43VER
JUCA💙💯💥
Still doesn’t feel real that he died. 43ver
Still hasnt really sunk in has it?
he go with he passion what he doing..same like steve irwin...
His face at 4:20 when he thinks he's about to smash into the curb 😂
Watching him drive was like watching a painter creating a masterpiece.
sick tribute!
Most amazing skills ,gone Way Too Soon. So much untapped knowledge too.  Definitely one of the Greatest Of All Time!
Le hicieron el año a @jucaviapri
RIP to the legendary Ken Block we know ur testing the limits in the spirit realm where we will all once again see you.  God bless we will never forget you 🙏 and what you brought to the table for this sport. Because race car 🏎 🏁❤

Ending Song? 🎉
Forever my Hero thank you guys for one more. Love and rewatch old gymkhana and daily transmisson episodes with Ken laying down man line at the old garage. Love you Ken Love you guys. Thank you ❤❤❤
His driving skills are legendary but after a while, the videos all look alike. Different cars and locations but still the same shrieking tires and billowing smoke.
That’s dope !
RIP mr. Block. You will be missed by many.
Watching Ken Block do his thing for the first time was just awesome. I really wanted to buy wrx cause of him. Bye Ken
KB 43 😍😍🥹🥹🥹😭😭
🤩🤩❤❤
I'm growing up watching all of his gymkhana videos up until now. The throwback at the end of the clip is such a reminiscent the good old days. Thank you Ken and team. Ken, you'll be remembered. 💐
That one airport shot looked like the map from cod. Always a Legend.🕊️
4:21  The best moment of the movie. When Ken thinks he's about to hit the curb backwards.
l thinking ken is legend never die and see this video
He was his best self when he was driving something. He died doing something he loved.. I can only hope the same for the rest of us.❤
Legend.

I am truly heartbroken evey day i think about you. I will always respect you and your legacy   43 always and forever. Drive fast dont die Risk everythang
Is it just me or does this seem pretty sloppy compared to his older stuff? Still incredibly impressive but feel like it could have been better
I waited a few hours before I watched this, and was worried it was going to make me sad, but man this was awesome.  We miss you Ken.
i been waiting on this vid since i seen the car at sema 2023. sad the legend will be missed
Это как секс с презервативом , вроде да  и вроде нет . 😅
YOU ARE A LEGEND! Ty for every you done!
@juca #JUCA wooooow
I dont know whats more impressive, ken's driving or the fact that they managed to get a whole airport to play around in. The credits were... Miss you and thank you for everything Ken and the hoonigan family.
Es electri donde esta el sutsut
Gracias por todo Ken Block’s.... pero que aburrido suena una lavadora con ruedas.
Ken Block got me into motor sports.   I am a mechanic because I saw the first Gymkannah(sp) and fell in love with machines. I will always miss Ken.
In tribute this car should be sold everywhere.
Thank you Mr Block.
4:07 ADA VW COKK
JUCA !
Love you, bro!😢 Lord, please look over his family. In God's name, we pray. Amen.
Can we take a second and appreciate this man's focus!
I wish I could like this video a thousand times!!!❤❤😢
one last vid R.I.P Ken, he was an inspiration to many, i feel for his family and how hard it would have been to see this come together
I hope this series continues to live on his memory. As for the video, I'd much rather roads shut down for this than "Stop Oil" protestors! Great driving portrayed here as is the previous films.
I wish everyday that Ken faked his passing and is going to show back up with a new gymkhana ...
KB 😔✊🏻
i still cannot believe he is gone. i pray we get to keep cleetus at this point. theres not many men that have changed motorsports forever and they are so sacred and live forever in our hearts and minds.
forever missed. RIP Ken Block
Legends will live forever. Love you Ken, and thank you Hoonigan team for this.
Respect!!! This guy and this videos will be missed
Always be alive, legend🚀

With what hes accomplished, we couldnt ever forget him. An AWD mastermind. #KB43ver
R.I.P [*] ;(
perfect audio, just the raw experience instead of some music
Несомненно легенда, но не представлял я последнее видео с Кеном Блоком как 8 минут езды на пылесосе
Fuck man, Ken is a LEGEND!! This video brought out all the emotion and holy shit you guys absolutely killed it. Wonderful video!
This was hard to watch, no engine sound and no Ken. rip
I pray for a day when Lia is pulling this off just like her daddy. RIP Mr. Block

Me rompió el corazón la noticia de su muerte. Me alegra que publicaran esta última locura.  El rey a muerto , ¡VIVA EL REY!! .
Never drive this sh*t again!!! EVER !!!
Miss him, glad this got to see the light of day, it was good.
Ken in my heart.  One day I'll show the kids what you've done for the world of motorsport  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Fantastic driving skills. But the fake sound of this electric car made it so annoying that I haven’t finished the video. As irritating as a bunch of mosquitoes in the summer 🤣
Electric is shit
@juca
Sorry i cant stop crying :(
Sh*t... Hoon in piece, legend #KB43VER
Is this a space ship? Or a car? It's a space ship on the ground!
always missed but you could tell from this video he was getting worse at this. by far worst hooligan.
Thank you Ken for pushing motorsport forward with your innovative and brilliant ideas. #KB43VER
❤❤
This is my first gymkhana film i knew ken but i didnt get to watch them so rip ken sorry for taking so long 😢  #KB43VER
I still can't believe it... miss u man.
miss u brother... rest in peace.
it looks like cgi at some points thats how unbelivably good Ken was
Grande Kenblock, que honor que tu último video de ese calibre sea en mi país.
Best skills ever ! Sound of engine make me wanna vomit 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
one of a kind!!! , we miss you WAY TOO MUCH!, God bless you Ken!!! big hugs to his family!
I have watched him from my junior highschool time. I remember back then I have always been so excited while watching him, but now i watching him in tears. I can't hold it man.
They will try replicate the genius driving of you Ken for years to come hoping you hitting them reverse entry u bends in the sky brother I’ll be eternally grateful to have been a witness thank you hoonigan RIP king block
🔥
The Fiesta was the best hoonigan for me. RIP Ken
RIP Legend! You were the reason myself and many more people had to be interested in motorsport and rally. I still remember that first 08' Khana was the reason I wanted a WRX as a kid, and finally got one in 2018. Huge inspiration, great guy, such a huge loss to the sport and the world.
Хуята.Звук двигателя решает
No MMS @juca la rompiste cabron!! Viva México!!!
RIP
😢😢😢😢
Godspeed KB43🏁
R  I P Ken, it was incredibly audacious fun. Thanks!  I'm sorry, but I still don't understand why he had to go now. Somebody up there has some insane, unimaginable, things that need to be done.
Beautiful
Unfortunate the last shebang of ken block was an electric blender. Bummer
Rest in Paradise, What a legend.
It took me a few days to be able to watch this. What a great video of the man doing what he loves. Kinda sad it’s the last one but love the tribute at the end.
ken block vc jamais será esquecido, corra no paraíso KB43 ever🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Never thought a celebrity death would bother me until we lost this man.
crazy and scary!
ken block was my favourit racer 🥲🥲🥲😔😔❤🏅🏁 (désolé pour les fautes d'aurtographes c'est que je parle français)
Love You Ken, I never got a chance to meet you but thank you for everything and to everyone who put this togetther thank you so much, couldnt have been easy ❤
R.I.P Ken block, the legend, we will never forget you, thanks for everything, when i have a son i will show him this videos
Since 8 min  the best part :D elektric can be kettle for boiling water :D
Great driver, may he rest in peace. But the video was boring, the constant whining from the electric car and and drivetrain is so preminant. I really do prefer the gasoline/diesel cars for these types of videos.
Man, this is an early Christmas present
Such a legend! R.i.p, your drifting will be missed 😢
Gotta keep that money rolling in long after he dead.
Мне кажется, что запах палённых покрышек, я слышал через дисплей своего смартфона😂💪👍
Y sale el buen @jucaviapri!
This is electrical car?
This was amazing and heartbreaking at the same time. Smiling and crying the whole time. You will never be forgotten Ken! #KB43VER
1) Ken - is a legend!  2) Electro car - is a poop
Legend
La ultima exhibición de ken y fue en la ciudad donde vivo, hasta siempre ken block (de algo bueno sirvio el AIFA)
to jest jakiś żart, wali animacją czy tam grafiką komputerową aż oczy bolą :(
Cant believe Ken Block's really died 😢
Ken Block The Legend!! Man you changed the game forever. Truly one of the best drivers.
S.I.P
Legends never die! ❤
Ken block number 1. Electric vehicle number ♾️🤢
This film become aware of how many years i watch that series. I think the stuff from 2012-2016 was like 2 years ago. 43ver Ken!
하늘에서도 드리프트 하고계시죠??
I had to stop myself from watching for a few days. I fucking hate crying
did he just drift GTA San Andreas Map? :DDD
🇧🇷 Igual ele nos não teremos mais , o cara se tornou uma lenda . Os vídeos dele serão lembrados pra todo sempre.
RIP 😢
Помним, скорбим! 🙏
Still alive

Desde españa... siempre te recordaremos Ken... descansa en paz
♥
Seasons Greetings Hoonigan.  KB43ver  Derelict
What id give to have my hometown shut down the streets so i can rip legally like this my god what a dream
Absolute legend only way to describe that man. Pure passion and skill we are quickly losing those two things in this world.
It feels so unreal, to see the new video getring launched from and with ken…
I have never heard an electric engine that loud
Great to see him back in the seat after such a long break , can’t wait to see next videos from him
Amazing skill level, but sounds horrible, love the sound of the Mustang
Legends never die
Ken is a legend! These videos aren't the same without the angry engine noises
i thought ken block was dead...
@jucaviapri 🤩🥳 Hey bro que chingón me pegue una llorada que orgullo, saludos desde Bogotá Colombia 🇨🇴 🥰
Just fantastic. We miss you ken!
ELEKTRIC 😂😂😂😂
I really like that there is no music. The silence and the pure kb feeling is incredible 🥺
Gone but never forgotten.
Too short for it to be the final one 🥹 🫂

Respect for Ken, but it looks like porn movie without sound
That Hoonitron sounds utterly glorious jheeez

Thanks for all legend❤
Un gran piloto que siempre tenemos en el recuerdo pero acostumbrados a verlo con cochazo párese k tenemos los oídos tapados ese audi le quita la escencia al video
Rip brother

R. I. P ken
For a second there I thought I was tripping, really just assumed for a just bit that he'd made it back from the dead somehow, with how recent the video is...
This car looks and behaves like what I imagined driving is as a little kid. This is literally HotWheels in real life 😂🎉
RIP what a legend
Звук машины как у зубной дрели. Такое впечатление как у зубного мастера сидишь.
Всю трассу от машины чтото отваливается.думал до финиша не доедет.обычный ваг
Ken we all loved you!❤ The fact this was published on my birthday feels special to me and know that from now on I will have a yearly marathon of all the gymkhana and electrikhana series...  Even just watching has always felt special and has always given me the passion to push forward, I've known the series ever since gymkhana 5 and I loved that focus rs mainly because my mom's car was a focus and because the owner of the gym where I went to had the blue rs for a while. I took many pictures of it!😅 I'll end my message with a goodbye to you Ken and some good luck to your daughter, Lia in her rally career! Hopefully you are up there watching over her and keeping her safe...
Nunca vi la ciudad tan tranquila! 😙🤌
RIP Kenneth Paul Block🕊
rest in peace brother . thanks for the gymkhana
Wow what an absolutely phenomenal tribute to #KB43V3R
Electric is trash.
I still can't believe he is gone .It's doesn't seem real .
That car looks so nasty . Love audi!❤
Some of the shots here are so smooth they look like they're 3d animations; Great job!
He’s dead
Juca juca
かっこいい。。。号泣しながら見た。最期の総集編なんかえづきながら見た。 全部リアタイで見てきたことを自慢したいわけじゃなく、この人と同じ時代を生きれたことに心から感謝してる。 Rest In Peace, Legend.
I never forgot the first Gymkhana came out. Since then been waiting for every Gymkhana to come out. What a legendary driver. You’re already missed by lot of us Ken. You’re gone but not forgotten legendary one. #KB43VER 💪🏾
Wasn’t had to clear out the AIFA for the stunt 😂😅 RIP Ken 😢

You are the hero, Ken! We always love you~43ever~
Another amazing video. RIP Ken
Just thinking this is his last video recorded makes me want to cry. RIP to a real legend

The world is a lot less Hoony without you, KB43. Glad Lia is carrying on in your shoes! You must be looking down proud as can be of her. KB43ver!
No mames que joya
😭😭😭
Bendito @Juca
Sounds like a Decepticons in Transformers
What a legend 😢
Love ya
Ya did good Ken, ya did good. 🕊️
He definitely sent it like it was going to be his last time, rip Ken
Mannnnnnnn. Rest easy Sir!
It's not the same without ratatouille! Electro theme is boring in such cases!
And the smog level in Mexico city just jumped 15%, compliments of the late, great, Mr. Block... You will be remembered!!!
Was literally just today wishing that I could see another one of your videos and when I got home, here you are. Thanks Ken.
Gotta wonder how bad it is to breath all that burned rubber all the time. Still cool to watch
Thank you for my youth.  Goodbye ❤
Legend
Still extremely interested gymkhana perfomance. RIP Ken
RIP
Bad ass driving right there.
Cerrar con broche de oro en México como debe ser. Bye hombre legendario
R.I.P Legend

#KB43VER
Mi padrino JUCA siendo parte de las Épicas tomas de esta joya para la memoria de muchos seguidores del gran Ken
Nothing but admiration and tears
I would like to see a full loop on one of these videos . Pastrana will do it
It definitely wasn't an iPhone battery.
Ken gave us one last gem and it's amazing.
❤️❤️🥹
Legend 🫡
And the JUCA Bochido great 🎉
You’ll never be forgotten Ken. Absolute Legend
This hit a lil deep ❤️
he and any vehichle he got into ...they became one! Absolutely amazing skills.You will always be missed and remembered!!
When someone can get you caring about a discipline that you were never interested in or knew in the first place, you know he's a legend! Thank you Ken Block for getting me into Rally and Gymkhana! Gone but never forgotten!
I teared up when your daughter went up the summit. Rest in peace legend, you'll be missed but never forgotten. #KB43VER
Ese bocho juca😂😂
E sempre um momento mágico ❤❤🎉
THE GOAT WE WILL MISS YOU!!!
you are greatly  missed legend🙏
Did they really close down a whole city for him to do this? Holy cow!
Its just not the same without a screaming engine 😢
Godspeed king. You wont ever be forgotten.
Really amazing but the song makes me sleeping...
Jucccaaaa
You guys should display a little bit more thanks to Block on that video. He was amazing!
They say you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain, but Ken lived long enough to see himself become a hero and died a villain, to cars and streets everywhere.
Love it, you guys have done it again, a phenomenal driver, coolest looking sports car & smoking tires.......WOW!
Feliz de ver este video, te hace sentir que estás vivo a través de Ken y de todo el trabajo de producción, me siento feliz de ver mi bandera (México) y saber que fue una de tantas casas para Ken ❤️ gracias 43ever ❤
R.I.P KEN
RIP gymkhana King ❤
THE MAN! NO MYTH, NO LEGEND, THE MAN!
R.I.P.
Mira que me jode poner algo negativo, pero vaya m*** los electricos, no tienen alma ninguna
Hes the man. I need cracks n pops of a gas engine, i love the focus car.
Quién más viene después del vídeo del Juca ? 🔥
NGL this got me a little knowing we won’t see Ken making anymore of these.
Rest in peace brother, your dedication for Automotive is amazing, and your clip video make everyone happy to watching 🙏🙏🙏
As kb wood say don't b dba
Hello Google I just wanted to say first how very sad I am that we've lost Kevin walked one of the most amazing drivers ever but yet he's got a beautiful daughter Julia thank God she's still doing the driving she's amazing just as thank you to all the shows that are still coming out and thank you for everything you do behind the scenes one of your biggest fans Bridget Beerman 😮
The electric car quietness made this video extra special. #43VER
Une légende... repose en paix
7 minutes of silence in memory of Ken.  I'm not sorry you left. I'm glad you were! ❤
❤😢❤
i miss you ken
This car is absolute magic. Nothing short.
Ahora me siento. . . . Vacio, de nuevo
mi estimado Juca!!! GRANDEE!!!!
We will never forget <3 <3 U made the world a better, faster place <3 keep the grip <3
:(..
Tire company needs a raise
GRACIAS LEYENDA 👑
That must have taken a truck load of tires.
The Goat lives 43ver
Rip Ken Block. You will always be my idol man.
Lia, your dad was a legend! #43
Rest in peace brother ✌️
Greatest loss to motorsport ever ❤
The amount of disrespect from hoonigan. KB was the legend that made everything possible and gave you guys a name. Now you are milking everything you can from it. There's nothing worse than a company making money from a dead man. They knew this video would make a ton of money because of the recent tragedy. Such a shame... I know I am not the only one that has lost all respect for hoonigan within this last year.
Like many, when I saw the 1st Gymkhana it blew my brain out. And every single episode got better than the previous one, this is no exception. Rest in Peace Mr Block, and thanks for everything you've done!
Shit
Jucaaaa ❤
Que pasado de vr
Rest in peace and in paradise legend! 🙏🏽💯🙏🏽
Bruv making me cry
oh goodie... the EV SCAM has penetrated the world of drifting.... 🤦‍♂️
Definitely a limit pusher, such a massive loss to the industry and the world in general. I feel that Leah will be taking his place very soon.  KB43VER
Electronic is so polite, yet aggressive! RIP Ken Block 🙏
IM CRYING EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF THIS VIDIO, WILL BE MISS YOU KB43VER <3
The power to motivate people to pursue their dreams, is not something that just anyone can achieve. But Ken did it with ease. KB43VER ❤🏁♥️🏁
I am sad you are gone, but i am happy that we had you.
Legends never die. My hero
this clips makes me enjoy cars, i love cars bc of the amazing stunts and velocity, he made me  inspired to become a rally driver, bc i love his driving and crazyness, thats something you can see on rally almost everytime, thanks legend for inspiring me on starting on this carrer, as soon as i get my driving license ill work for it, fly high legend
Finishing the video at the airport is truly symbolic. Thanks and goodbye Ken! Well done for everything you've done since that first Gymkhana. I was in tears watching this video. We miss you terribly! KB43ver 💙
❤❤❤
Best content on you tube.
KB43VER🫡❤️❤️❤️
RIP to an absolute freaking legend in the auto world. This video made my freaking year. Thank you for putting it out for all of us to see him shredding the streets once more. KB43ver
Will be missed you Ken block in this last video 💚💚💚. #KB43VER
this might be the greatest video ever uploaded on youtube
Love you Ken you will be missed and have and will inspire others for generations to come
Miss this guy, he was not done yet ... GBOGH
Wish it was in MPH. I'm too stupid to do the conversion on the fly.
Desde arriba asiendo donas desde el cielo
Can u put lia on the throttle for future gymkhana films
I love Ken's driving (R.I.P), but really hate the sound of the electric car. It sounds like a high-pitched dentist drill. This video is better to watch with the sound off unfortunately. EVs are so emotionless😢.
RIP LEGEND 🙏🏽💯🏎️💨
STOP POSTING VIDEOS WITH THUMBNAILS AND DECRIPTIONS AS IF KENS STILL WITH US, ITS DISGUSTING AND DISRESPECTFUL, JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE MONEY ROLLING IN WITH HIS NAME AND I FIND IT TO BE DISTURBING.
I'd never imagine I'd cry from watching a Gymkhana video. Rest in Peace, Ken. Thanks for everything. #KB43ver
Ken you made such an impact on the world. Farewell.
Tenía que despedirse en mi hermosa ciudad de México!!! Por siemprete querremos Ken Block!!!🎉🎉🎉
Incredible footage. What a legend
Thank you Ken for all you've done for us car lovers! We miss you
Love blocky...xxxxxxxx best racer ever!!!! Xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Love how they just block half of the city just for Ken to do some donuts.
Please put some music to cover this awful "bzzzz" from electric engine. Don't worry Ken we will always remember you on a loud combustion engine car!
I think almost everyone here, can remember waking up some mornings, looking on social media, and seeing a new gymkhana had dropped and we would be filled with pure excitement, what ever you were doing, you stopped and watched, gasped in awe. This one hits a lil differently. knowing this is the final time but still in absolute awe, you were such a legend. you changed the game, and for that, we thank you! <3   Rest In Peace Ken Block
For life ken Block ❤❤
Man this was just insane to watch and as I’m watching this the whole time I’m thinking what a legend then reality sets in and I remember he’s gone. It’s hard for me to watch his stuff now I love it but I get a bit emotional when I do he’s a very inspiring icon. KB43VER
Ken block will always have a special place in my heart for showing little me what driving is really about forever missed
I’m no driving expert, but it looks like Ken’s driving was only getting better and better with time when others would be losing a step or two.   I’m excited for the next gen Khana series, hopefully his daughter takes the reins, but either way I’m stoked for another. Don’t slow down doing these guys! Love ‘3m all. R.I.Power Ken!
R.I.P
❤juca
goddamnit its so bad to have no idea whats going on
Last Dance KB43 R.I.P
wow, this man was something else. Amazing production!
Rest in peace Ken. Keep hooning in Paradise
A talent like this comes once in a centuary,  r.i.p and thank you for all that you did for motor sports! <3
R.I.P Legend

🫡 The GOAT
Min. 4:07 sale el "que transa banda como estan":'D Por cierto bien glaceadas esas donas por toda la ciudad 👌👌
That's a peach of a car. The red driveshafts are a nice touch.
слабенько и не зрелищно, зато дыму из под колес то напустили, видимо скомпенсировать отсутствие звука мотора
🙏🏾
Ken block you will always be in our heart forever. You are legend 😢
Legend ❤
@jucaviapri graaaaaaande de grandes un saludo perro desde España
To good for this planet is all we'll see you again
Thanks Ken for all the amazing videos!!!  You are missed and like so many have said ..... watching this video triggered deep emotions of a great loss.... none of us will ever forget you!!
Forever remembered, The North American Drift King. #43forLife #NADK43 <3
Always legend 💪
Thank you so much for everything you were, and everything that you gave the world... Rest in peace legend, you will forever be remembered ❤
Master on masters !! Sky is the limit, your life was over the limit! see you later!
This was incredible. As a community of people dreading ev's ken made it as cool as possible. A true legend
Thank you Ken and Hoonigan for this episode .  Спасибо Кен и Хуниган за этот эпизод !! Рад был снова увидеть легенду , Очень жаль что так случилось
#kb43ver
God Speed!
absolutely amazing defo tugged at the heart strings RIP
Электрические авто экологичные😂😂😂 Это для лохов информация,они ещё больше загрязняют атмосферу,при производстве,при заправке,и утилизации батарей,чем авто с двигателем внутреннего сгорания. Элита обеспокоена экологией,но они на свои сходки летают на частных самолётах😂😂😂
Señor Ken Block, gracias a tus video me empezaron a gustar mucho más los auto de carreras y eres una inspiración para mí. Sea a dónde sea que ahora el destino te tiene, espero que sigas disfrutando de todo lo que más te gusta hacer. No serás el mejor de todos los tiempos, pero te aseguro que dejaste un legado insuperable, para cualquiera que quiera hacer lo mismo que tu hiciste. Todo tus logros, autos, eventos, derrapes, situaciones divertidas como asombrosas, jamás serán olvidadas. Gracias por todo tus Gymkhana. Donde sea que estés, seguí demostrando de lo que sos capas con un coche para Rally. ❤te amamos y queremos, todos tus fan y seguidores. Hasta siempre crack❤
Correct me if I'm wrong but the car has a potentiometer acting as a gear selector? I mean as in terms of each click of the shift paddles is a different powers level restriction?
very few will ever be able to do what Ken did in his lifetime, he will forever be missed and looked up to as on of the greats! Thanks for all the joy you've brought me ❤❤❤❤
Perfect movie 👍
Damn. This won’t be the same without Ken and the Hoonicorn. Still loved the video though!
Спасибо Кен и команда за всю вашу работу все эти годы! Буду показывать эти легендарные видео своим внукам!
Thanks for the cool memories Ken, you will live on 43ver.
Величайший автогонщик всех времён и народов мира! Навсегда останешься в наших сердцах! ❤
It will be cool to see of his daughter Lia will continue the videos!  RIP Ken, you're videos are what got me into rally cross.
❤
This great man was only 4years older than me and I love racing and going nuts in cars live life strong you never know wen it’s your time nothing but love for his loss and family left behind
Damn! The man could drive! RIP to a legend!
Damn it Ken you made me cry 😭 🕊️
Incredible. Shame about the electric car.
The best ever!! #kb43ver
Thank you Ken Block and the Hoonigan Team to  brought this  content to us giving joy and car love.  Ken You'll never die in our minds
Siempre en nuestros corazones apacionados por la velocidad! Gracias Ken Block!
Awd mustang was sooooo much cooler not going to lie... this audi rips but it just aint the same.. Miss you Ken. 💜💜💜💜
Damn, what can I say.  First I would like to say well done Scotto and team on the film it was perfect, no one could have done a better job.  True professionals, and I'm sure you hear all the time about how wonderful you all are and yada yada.  But I want to tell you about how your films have changed my life,  how in 2012 I was a homeless druggy that had lost all the spark in my life and frankly didn't care if it ended.  Then you guys shut the bay bridge down and a bunch of other streets and landmarks throughout the city, I was lucky enough to catch Ken launch over that crest on Russian hill and I was blown away.  I had no idea who Ken or [HOONIGAN] were but after looking y'all up I was hooked.  You see I grew up racing and loved every second of it, but when I hit my teenage years it was a wrap.  That dream was over,  and so I spent the next 20 years living a miserable, pointless, depressing life. Reading about Ken and Ken's life and his success in business, and his late start as a professional racer and the success he had doing it clicked something in my brain and I felt like I wasnt to old to start racing again.  That I could do it if I really tried and worked at it,  so I got my s#@% together and 3 years later I bought a shifter kart and started racing at the local track.  I know I would still be some junkie nobody if you guys hadnt filmed gymkhana in SF that year.  Ken quickly became my hero. Feb. 2023 I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and eventually had to sell my kart and everything else to pay for medical bills but I havent given up like I would have before Gymkhana and #43. I will get a new setup someday hopefully, but I want to say Thank you [HOONIGAN] and KB.  you are forever my hero.
I am missed.ken Block ❤️
Ken Block is the legendary Driver and drifter the gymkhana series is iconic and rest and Peace Ken Block ❤️
Legend 😇🙏🏁
How are you Ken!! We all here miss your smile hahahaha, and hope you live peacefully and always be happy!! We all love you Ken!! 🔥🔥
R.I.P Grandmaster!!! Always sad...
Ken Block l’idole de toute une génération ! Hoonigan forever !
I bet Ken wanted to go under a plane... But Brian was like how about a boom lift 😂
Who would have thought that in bocho de juca would be in a Ken video.  How wonderful is that
Oversized RC Cars is all electric cars are change my mind
F
#KB43VER DIOS LO TENGA EN LA GLORIA GRACIAS POR MOSTRARNOS TU PASION POR LOS CARROS Y SER UN EJEMPLO A SEGRUIR KEN BLOCK POR SIEMPRE....
#KB43VER
Вечная память. Вторая половина ролика как бальзам на душу. Приятные воспоминания за последние 15 лет. По-моему тогда увидел первую джимхану в доках на Subaru STI. В эпоху до YouTube.
4:06 la escena del bocho de JUCA! que brutal dios mio EN LA ULTIMA ELECTRIKHANA representando a mexico muy cabron!! SIN PALABRAS DIOS TENGA A KEN BLOCK EN LA GLORIA DIOS LO CUIDE DONDE QUIERA QUE ESTES, MIS 2 EJEMPLOS A SEGUIR!! EN UN VIDEO IMORTALIZADOS PARA LA HISTORIA AUTOMOTRIZ #ELTUNINGNUNCAMUERE.
Solo estoy aquí por el juca ❤❤

Kenny killed more tires than hitler did people.
A true artist. I guarantee he would have beaten the stig’s lap times.
RIP Legend.

Race in Peace legend! #kenblock #43
Legends never die! Thanks for the years of entertainment KB , making us all dream to have those kind of driving skills. Rip beast!
Long live the swing king
God, he was such a great Driver What A Legend!!
My Favorite Drivers of #43  Ken Block and Richard Petty!!!  Wish Ken could of Raced Indy 500 and Roasted the Tires Off A Mopar!!!   When I get to work Monday I am going to tell a nurse practitioner who drives an electric Audi to watch Ken!!   I will Roast the Tires off My OLD 73 Chall when she runs again in Memory of Ken!! Miss You Man!
Man I miss this man he was a hero to a lot of people and between him and Travis an inspiration for me
JUCA❤
I miss his shit
Ken you will be missed! Such talent is so rare!🙏
What a Legend, you'll be missed KB. Happy Drifts in Heaven.
Why as a grown ass man can I not watch the end of this without crying
Идущие на смерть  приветствуют тебя.
Спасибо за все Кен, тебя будет очень сильно не хватать
Does that audi naturally sound like a li-po electric RC car or is it sound affects? Because it sounds insane! 😂
C'e molta finzione in questo video, a partire dai fumogeni bianchi che sono stati utilizzati.. Viviamo nell'era delle apparenze. Cosa peggiore è che ci crediamo e pure applaudiamo. Bella merda.
#bestdriversincewalter
Удивительно Кена с нами уже нет но ролик вышел три дня назад
EV's are absolute dog shit and I hope we never see another EV car on your channel again. With that said I have the utmost respect for Ken and his amazing legacy he left for us.
я з України прийміть мої глибокі співчуття  так гонщик від бога він завжди буде у нашій памяті та сердці
Gracias por todos los sueños que nos regalaste, gracias por inspirar una pasión en muchos, gracias por todo, leyenda! KB43ver 🖤🫡
Ken the boss 🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥
RIP Ken
Legend!! KB43VER
Eterno ken block 🙏🏻
The only place where he went straight - was straight to Heaven.  R.I.P. Ken Block...
For a moment I forgot that he left us a year ago, this only happened to me with Paul Walkwer when I watch Fast and Furious…
Juca
who's cutting onions🥲Thanks Ken Block and the team behind him that made these videos unforgettable for generations to remember❤
Juca !!!
Rip drift Well brother 😢
That video was to quiet to be de last one 😢… we need more V8
Remember watching him film multiple takes of the scene with the cable car bus on California St in SF.
That car IS the centre of gravity
#KB43VER
Rest in piece, your family and friends can be proud you created something beautiful! you built a legacy in cars outside of compettitive racing, doing things all other drivers wish they could do.
4rever❤ But today I came for @juca
Ken block will forever be an inspiration ❤
JUCA
The car sounds like the drill at the dentist’s.
Block Forever 🤙👍👍
I am honored that I was able to shake this man's hand. He was a true inspiration to Sport of rally. I will never forget Ken Block.
Aguante el jucaaaaaaaa
Un grand merci pour ces images déjà.  Il y avait son coup de volant, c'est sûr !! Mais aussi un mental admirable et une bonne personne.  A+ mec.
Il restera à jamais le premier le plus grand et le plus incroyable !!! RIP💔
_Пушка_гонка_ракета_
sounds like a dental problem
Absolute legend ❤
We miss you
The legend driving clouds in paradise ! T.y for all ! Kiss from south of France. RIP
We love you Mr Ken
Ride in Heaven next to Paul ❤️
we love you KEN r.i.p
Descansa en paz maestro 🫡🤌🏼
KB won't be forgotten. That's not just a phrase, he did so much epic shit that I'm pretty sure that in 10-20 years, these videos will still be circulated around the internet.
There's no harm done. I always test the transmission that way. The rear-end for stress factors.
The 360 over the bump was absolutely disgusting.
I never got to meet him but I will say that all the videos he did they were great. He will be missed. Keep up the good work. I am happy to see that they family and friends are keeping his name out there forever Ken #KB3VER
Eres grande Ken.
right on
RIP legend!
Кен легенда , вечная память 🕯🕯🕯 🙏🙏🙏♥️
Stunning drive scenes. We miss you, Ken, my condolences from Spain. You are a legend forever
[The Legend]
❤❤
Would love to see his daughter do this for him rip ken will never forget what a legend
And this is why Ken is and will be known as a great legend to this day, and beyond his death
Ken Block will forever live on as one of, if not the best motorsport driver to ever get behind the wheel.
How the heck do you close 1 of the largest cities in the world!?
Ojalá te conozca en el nuevo mundo! Que Jehová te tenga en su memoria!
Dos de mis favoritos en un mismo Video
Лучший…
never stop moving, don't slow down. thank you very much.
Помним!🦁
слезы наворачиваются с 8:14
Grande el juca saludos desde costa rica
R.I.P KEN WE MISS YOU
😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔
I've been waiting for this all year! Thank you for sharing this final video. I was crushed by the loss of such an icon who lived right here in Utah. This man was a huge influence for so many and will continue to inspire many more!
Этот тип похоже не умеет с первого раза свои трюки делать, в его клипах всегда весь асфальт расчерчен его предыдущими следами, немного напрягает такое наблюдать..  🤦
Sempre nei nostri Cuori💖💓
RIP my legend....until we meet again. Love from Shillong (India)
Thanks for all. RIP…😢
All the pollution mexico city has already and you add all that tire smoke.   Maybe one of their gods got upset.  They did use hunan sacrifice 😮✌️
👍👍👍👍👍👍❤
Rest in Peace master !
When I grew up I watched you video's with awe, I will remember them till the day I die. Thank you and keep Hooning up there.
He still here as long as we remember him he always will be here  From the USA to the world
Legends NEVER die, I am sobbing after that last part. I miss this man, always will.
Forza and audi we need this e-tron in fh5
I'm going to miss him and these videos. RIP
Adrenaline 💯 Emotion 💯  ❤️ You Ken ❤️
I feel unstoppable watching this video
A Legend who Lived.
Some boyo RIP 🙏 ken
One More…. Thanks For Everything Ken 🍻🇺🇸
Thank you so much
Legend.
My dear CdMx as a track for Ken... Man, that brought me some tears. We miss you Ken!
It's time for a new series with Lia 🙂
Respect, for a great driver ❤❤
Я один пошёл проверить откуда нахуй дует в квартире? То ли сквозняк, то ли окна свистят... Так и не нашёл причину. У кого такое было?
Up until halfway i was enjoying the hell out of this and then it just hit me, 30 years old and couldnt stop the water in my eyes, but I'm just glad to be able to watch another new video of Ken doing his thing. Its insane they can shut down this whole area to almost 0 humans in sight. So mad we lost this guy.
Aquí los q vinimos solo a ver la escena del juca
Покойся с миром братец 😶
7:27 that actually sounded like a freaking plane taking off 🛫✈️  Power of electric ⚡ Motors + Ken 'the  Legend' Block = Perfecttion 😁👌👌👌💯 Rest in peace ✌️ my friend, the world 🌍 loves U.
I miss the days when car companies would make crazy cars for the consumer. Not just bodykits and a badge
4:54 Rocket 🚀 launch!!! Love Ken he Will for ever be missed and remembered as *Ginkana Monster*  What a insanely skilled driver he was!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Niente sound=niente adrenalina!
He will be missed.
When "Don't Slow Down" started playing and the credits rolled, I definitely teared up. I don't think a celebrity death has ever hit me as hard as Ken's. The world will never be the same without him, but seeing his family carry on his legacy has been incredible to watch. I look forward to Lia's first Gymkhana.
Quien dice que los eléctricos son aburridos!!! Grande Ken vivirá siempre en los corazones de muchos!
RIP to a legend!
Thanks for everything Ken! ❤  He is really neither a friend nor a family member of mine, nor am I affected by the death of people I know who are close to me; but when I found out about Ken's death, it made me very sad, I considered it something tragic and irremediable.  The best driver in this world ceased to exist, that is something that cannot be replaced  It will always be in my memory! ❤
Juca 🇲🇽 MEXA ❤
You can really tell how much he enjoyed the flawless transition from forward to reverse to forward at airport. Miss those facial expressions Ken had. We all miss you Ken! Thrash responsibility!
engine sound is like a toy....
You are the best for ever ❤
💯💢🧡💛💚💙💜 43 EVER
Hoonigan crew, when I was 3 years old I think I saw the first Gymkhana and I was hooked I would wait for the next one to come out and I love that you guys held on to this video before putting it out so we could watch Ken do his thing one last time #KB43VER
The best to ever do it.
Daily Blessings Coming! .. Thank You ALL for Everything Everyday!! .... R.I.P Ken Block... We've lost so many Great People too early it seems like. But I BELIEVE EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON and We STAY BLESSED EVERYDAY!! ... Everyone's Time will come soon enough. There's Not enough Time to spend together here on Earth. Life gets even harder when you lose your Loved ones closest to You....
Ken Block was really the best driver in the world! His spectacular stunts and drifts are gorgeous! We all miss him… RIP legend #KB43VER
I literally cried watching this, what a hero he was to the industry
Thank you Ken Block's, wherever you are, you will never be forgotten
KB43EVR!!!
🖤🖤🖤
Les sensations à bord doivent être folles mais niveau spectacle, c’est clairement un gros en dessous des thermiques précédentes. Ça me fait penser à l’Extreme E (les espèces de buggy électrique), j’ai regardé deux minutes et j’ai arrêté car visuellement c’était beau mais ça s’arrêtait là. Rien qui te prends aux tripes comme avec la rage des moteurs thermiques.  Bref, ken tu nous manques, même en électrique.😢
KB4EVER God rest his soul and thank you for the joy you brought us. Thankfully your daughter is here as your legacy and is doing you proud.
We petrolheads will miss you very much king
Thank you, Ken Block.  We had fun.  It will remain an everlasting and unforgettable memory in history.  We will not forget you 😔
godspeed Sir Kenny from the Block
Kens driving skill are impressive but them tires steal the show!!
The best of the world.  I don’t think will be any one better than him. RIP.
RIP Ken.  Electric cars are so boring though.
El mejor piloto..... Por siempre te recordaremos 💪❤️😔
<3 love you big man, you will always be remembered <3
R.I.P tha g.o.a.t tha legendary ken block😢❤
Thank you for everything, Ken and the Hoonigans life changers  BL☠CK43 #KB43VER
ken block ❤
We miss you legend
Como le habrán hecho para que no haya gente en el AIFA?
Ну так себе... Электродрифт, не возможно слушать😮
😞🚬
Good effort but that high pitch noise hurts my ears, so no thanks for electric stuff. Shame to have this as last ever video of Ken doing his thing :(
An absolute legend. Still can’t believe he’s gone.
Always been a petrol head and have always loved watching Ken and the Hoonigan gang push driving to the limit. RIP Ken
The fiesta baby! Ken block is the reason I owned a WRX and then a fiesta st. Legend
F.
@marekskvarek3589  super video
Miss you Ken, what an amazing man
Only time I liked an EV was when Ken were driving it.
Not going to be the same without these
Чайник закипел! Выключай
Thanks Ken❤ Keep on shredding in heaven
Hearing the Audi S1's electric powertrain whizz is memorizing. It sounds like a toy RC vehicle.     RIP Ken Block.
Ken has done something unreal🥲
There will never be another Ken Block, but then again his daughter is a whole different story. She makes him live on. Go tear it up girl!!!!!
May your wheels spin the same wherever you are now, Ken.
Two things are disappointing. One; this isn't a stock Etron I can buy. Two; Borla is sponsoring an EV.
Legend. ❤
Покойся с миром!!!
This feels like forza horizon 5. If it was in Mexico.... Oh wait
Russia by DDkaba 🤙
I hope you and Paul are having a blast together. You were a wonderful dad, amazing mentor to countless people, and you inspired millions upon millions to chase their automotive dream. Rest easy in paradise Ken🕊️  #KB43VER
LEGEND RIP
both ken block and the incredible sounds of a combustion engine will be missed
So cool, looks and sounds like my remote controlled car a drove as a child. Same same but a different ❤
You will always be missed, ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ KB43ver
I still cant believe that Ken Block is not here anymore 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Крутой мужик был😎
Bittersweet. Thanks for the memories. Condolences to family and friends.
❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏
Don’t. Slow. Down.  #KB43VER
legend🕊🕊🕊
R.I.P pilote incroyable avec ces shows de Gymkhana unique au monde
Too much carbon footprint. Greta Tunberg will oppose. LOL
The editor didn't use music in this video, and we all know why. Respect for "Last Gymkhana" of Ken Block. R.I.P. #KB43VER🖤
This guy was playing Forza Horizon in real life
alright yeah someone make a giant statue of this man he is a legend.
R.I.P Dude
RIP to a legend who evolved drifting forever ❤️💯
I know he left a legacy, but ill regret not getting the chance to see more shots of him loving life.
Fuck man we lost him too soon! Special man ❤
some duke of hazzard shit right there ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
43 always in heart
Sou realmente Fã desse cara. Legado incrível. Até com carrinho de fricção faz milagre... Parabéns.
Loved your videos for a long time. You're a timeless star. Thanks for the memories. Rest in peace.
The ending got me hard core, hoon in peace Ken
R.I.P. Legend!
We miss you Ken, we miss you very much. 😭  You will always be the king of Gymkhana
RIP, maestro ❤
JUCARROSSALVAJES   #ELTUNINGNUNCAMUERE
Me when i used to play with my RC car, this is exactly how i pictured it in my head :D

❤❤❤❤ long live ken Block
Thanks Ken , rest in peace !
We miss you, Ken. Truly the greatest to ever to do it
RIP Ken. Absolute legend
#KB43VER
Ele e uma das pessoas que será lembrada pela eternidade certamente não existe definição melhor do que lenda sempre estará em nossas memórias e em nossos corações
RIP Ken! 🤘❤ #KB43VER
Seeing ken block wince as he does a backwards entry was something else
Will always be missed. 10:19 will stay in my memories pretty much forever.
thank you all!
You are a legend, rest in peace 🥀🥀🥀
incredible! 🎉❤
I LOVE the Montage-Khana at the end. Seriously and end of an era with Ken. This has been such an amazing series and I hope to see it back some day with Lia or Travis. KB43ver. Cheers
Ken eres y fuiste el mejor todos recordaremos tus brillantes conducciones todos te tendremos en la mentes y gracias por todo
143
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹 King is of gymkhana Always remember your inspired
I remember watching the first Gymkhana on repeat (didn't actually know this was the first Gymkhana, it was just a video saved on my phone I got from a friend), I was blown away every time I watched it, at that time it was unthinkable. These stunts might have been the reason I became a car freak later... Thank you, Ken
Greatest legend to do it the best. Rest in paradise
I gotta say that was one of the least great vids that ken did. It wasnt to crazy or wow factor. Vegas was 10x better. I wish they did some crazy shit. But ill enjoy his old vids forever. I think when he was younger he did more risky shit lol
great tribute to KB guys, he'll be missed
RIP Legend. Thank you for the decads of entertainment! 43ver ❤
thanks god hes not alive to watch this ...
Rest in peace legend...
Perfect Car for Walter Röhrl
Miss you buddy. I'll never forget hanging in the service areas and getting to chat even though I was just crew from a different group. You have the most infectious laugh. You leave a void in many places. #KB43VER
This is not a finale. This is a celebration, full of memories and great times. The world has never seen anything like Ken Block and will never again, but the love for crazy shit and cars will carry on as Lia takes the seat.   Fly high 43.  KB 43VER
The one and only. RIP Legend
An absolute legend. RIP
RIP Legend KB
#KB43EVER🤟
Dam man cried while smiling on the second half aye R.I.P LEGEND!!!
Rest in peace legend 🕊️
Ken will forever be known as the tire slayer  Rest in peace legend #KB43VER
Absolut madness, for me personally one of the best ken's movies. Cameras Action view drones speed slowmo. Magic of the wheelman 😊🎥😱🚘😎 RIP Ken 🍻
The end?
Видно сразу как тяжесть(вес) батареи влияет на динамику авто при эксплуатации)
Couldnt have left a better mark on a community! You will be forever missed and never forgotten!!!
Ken was a insane driver.
rip brp hi ru
We will ALWAYS love you, buddie!!!
Высший пилотаж! Команда Hoonigan спасибо за видео. Привет из России! Кен светлая память.
Лучший в своем деле!!! Жаль что погиб, навсегда в наших сердцах!
We miss you Ken! We miss that daredevil in you, like to take chances myself, you’ll never be forgotten
Is it just me, or does the car just look sooooo heavy and uncomfortable? Every little jump it looks like ken was bracing for how rough it was.
Pure destruction🫶🏻🫶🏻 And I still don't believe it😔
As they say legends never die. R.I.P.
What a fitting, bittersweet celebration of everything Hoonigan. I feel sad but hugely appreciative. Thank you to everyone involved. Awesome.
❤
lenda !! kkk até ele achou q ia pegar no meio fio 04:18
Fuck he did a great job 🥺🥲
That guy right there was a Fuckn beast even just this one video is so wicked and I guess if u want to do something just go do it!!!!!
Y love you forever ❤❤❤❤❤❤
what a spectacular human, my empathy and sympathy goes out to his surviving family.
the fun in his face tells u all! ❤❤❤rest good brother !
We miss you ken. Hope your having as much fun up there as you did here
Спасибо.
🇫🇷 :quand sa fille prend t elle le flambeau ... la relève???? Cordialement
😮❤
Thanks !! 🙌🏼🙌🏼
🫶
It's kinda hard watching this, as amazing as it is to see Ken go at it again it's very difficult knowing this will be the last time we see him do this. R.I.P. to an absolute legend, a father, a pioneer and an inspiration ❤️
Siempre te recordaremos como una leyenda Ken block
there's something strangely peaceful about the onboard shots that's very affecting, even the shots in vegas in the same car don't have the same feeling. just the combination of the light, the different angle, and I think cutting to it for longer maybe really just makes me feel. Well done on this whole thing, I'm so glad we can have it :)
Grazie...❤
stunts are good but missing the IC engine .....Electric car are just a metal body on 4 wheels .......😒😒
Didn't expect this awesome video!!
Good job Ken thank You for all..
The World of Cars. Presented by your one and only. Ken Block.
A beautiful final tribute to the King of gymkhana. Your legacy will continue with Lia and is in good hands. Rest in power.
No por que haya sido en CDMX voy a decir que fue el mejor #gimkana. Si ese fuera el caso estuvo mejor el de Guanajuato. Simplemente no tolero el ruiditto ese de los eléctricos. Si mucho torque y todo. Pero si hace falta que ronquen. No aplaudo como foca. Simplemente que bonito que haya sido en Mexico. Se te extraña Ken Block.
R.I.P Ken Block
Ken was only one and we can see that now, he was not replacible and now there is no one that will do stuff  like this ❤❤  Actual fact:  when you look at the concrete MOST OF THE STUNTS were FIRST TAKE and the hardest ones were like 2nd or 3rd at most. #kb43ver
RIP ken block
💪😎POWER🔥🌪️💣!.
What a mad c@$t RIP mate
RIP et merci pour ses très bon moment.
Lol its sounds like some RC model ^^
He made that lil car moan better than my exes 🥹😭
I started crying 😢😂 here 0:16 and I blown smiling 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣here 10:32 when I realised that THE HAPPINESS DOESN'T FINISH WHEN TYRES GONE, THERE'S RIMS TOO! We will remember Ken for this also.  I would like to write in Italian to do an Italian tribute at the person who makes we happy when he drives and enjoys, but I write in English, in this way more people read and understand that Ken arrives all over the world, in Italy too.  We missing you. 🖤
BLOCK FOR EVER ❤❤
Jejejeje que risa al ver a JUCA!!! GRANDE!!! Sin duda lo mejor del video es la ultima parte, que recuerdos ...  KEN y HOONIGAN  marcaron  un antes y un después en los videos de coches Y  en YOUTUBE, un vacío imposible de llenar. Por la parte del electrodoméstico humeante... es como folla* con un muda, al final te falta algo, es un si , pero NO!
Thank you Ken, you will forever hold a place in my heart as someone I truly looked up to, one of the main reasons I love rally the way i do, RIP and hopefully you’re building some pretty cool shit up there, wherever you are ♥️
RIP ken block
THANK YOU 😊 🙏 (F.TH)
Dźwięk jak z maszynki do golenia... Dno 😭
Legend is life my heart ❤️ #KB43ver
Coming from a skate/bmx background, I can remember see the first gymkhana and being blown away that there was this car video that was like a skate video, it was good to see some anarchy in a industry that is normally so exclusive and elitist, changed the game forever 🤘
Hearing his laugh in the first :45 😢  Legends never die, but mann...😢
Juca entre lazos con el mejor🤙🏻🤙🏻❤️
Sooooo bad with an electric car !
RIP the legend
i love that he did donuts at potted plants R.I.P Ken Block
Rest In Peace Legend
I feel like this is them testing ai and deep fake technology
❤❤❤❤ miss him
R.I.P. LEGEND
I use to get so excited seeing Ken Block drive in such a different way. All gone.
Кэн Блок был просто создан для этого дела 😢 просто невероятное вождения машины будто нереально такое делать, а он смог и мы конечно же восхищены этим делом, нам будет тебя не хватать
brought to tears due to the montage at the end
Ken you are a legend! We miss you!
F
Don't be sad that he's gone  Be glad that he was
RIP LEGEND❤
The One The Only Legend!!!!!! Miss ya Everyday thanks Hoonigan for the Video it’s Epic!!!!!
The lack of any engine sound just leaves a loose end. Watching mums hoover do it isn't the same
I miss Block and Pure engine sound. No mixer
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Gone but NEVER forgotten. As sad as it is there will be no more, the legacy continues & his memory with live on through his history, brands, family & fans across the planet. Gutted you’ve gone, so thankful we had you 🤙🏻 #KB43VER #RIPKB43
Удивительный человек👍 Спасибо тебе за твой труд... Вечная память
Rest in peace Ken Block, forever a legend of the motorsports scene. One of the greatest of all time.
I love to see the tire marks of his attempts. You really get to see Kens skill. It looks like its really only 2 or 3 attempts beforehand to nail it
Vengo del video de jucaaa
Rest in peace.
Бляяяяяя. Это одно из самых скучных!!!!!!
Master!! REST IN PEACE, MAY YOUR SPIRIT LIVE ON!
😮😮😮😮
This is the definition of seeing a master at work
А что с ним случилось? Умер? Поч?

I don’t know if a normal e-tron can drive in shift but KEN fascinated me with his elegant movements. Thank you for your great job!  RIP KEN
По следам на асфальте видно что пенсионер уже не с первого раза трюки мочил,так тупо умереть,сидел бы в городе крутил питаки по 40 раз ,монтаж бы все поправил ,нет полез в горы на снегоходе😂

The best way to expend your own money! You will be a legend 4ever
Never saw him close his eyes before thinking he was gonna have a big hit when he went pass the Bug...🥵 epic...😮👏👏
Never forget him 🙏
RIP LEGEND <3
Легенда
It’s incredible to see another gymkhana with Ken. He’s influenced me in several ways, not just with cars, but in several other aspects. Thank you Ken and RIP 🙏
Bonjour à tous.  Une grande pensée a Ken et a sa famille.  Merci beaucoup pour toutes ces magnifiques images de ce génie du sport auto qui nous a fait rêver toutes ces années
Запиленные трюки до дыр . Ред бул и японцы круче вещи вытворяют .
Legends never die...

RIP Brother
Прощай, Легенда.
Кен Блок был и остаётся великим! Привет из России)

Pensé que la toma de Juca sería más cerca al vocho
Juca soy tu fan❤
No top , bof bof
Gonna be honest. This was hard to watch one of only many upon many epic videos ken was a amazing person, driver, but most importantly. A amazing father, father of a amazing daughter and father of pure badassery
Oh man the goosebumps
bro I'm on the verge of crying watching this. Ken Block is the greatest of all time
El mejor sin duda alguna
Legend
The man was a machine. May God bless and rest his soul
Аж мурашки по коже
For a sec, I thought he is alive and just posted another video
Классный водитель ничего не скажешь, жалко что ушел рано((
RIP Ken
Never going to forget the first time my mate showed the first Gymhkana video many years ago back in our teens, I couldn't believe it. Thanks for everything Ken, RIP.
F
Thanks for being my inspiration in the motorsport, hope to see u up in the sky, Rest in peace buddy!!
You will be missed Ken… you are missed. Your contribution to Motorsport will live on for eternity… you built a legacy that will last… and that’s what all of us can hope to do in our lives. Cheers to racing the best cars and drifting the best corners on the other side.
No gasoline- no fun
Legends don't die..
#RipKenBlock #TheGOAT
He is a legend❤
what an awesome tribute to a great man  and father. We miss you ken!
RIP Block but can we all agree this electric stuff is garbage or are we still pretending it's not?
:,(
RIP Ken. What a fucking incredible legacy and what a saga of awesome videos
I cried. I couldn't help it.
I put watching this off a few days,  didn’t want it to end. End of an era, thanks for all the memories.
RIP brother, we all love you
Vengo del canal del Juca, amo ese bochito como no tienen idea😍😍 que gran video! Ken que habilidad, es increíble lo que puede hacer detrás del volante 🤩🤩🤩
4:21 глаза закрыл. Я думал он ничего не боится. Пока мы его помним он живой.
Спасибо всем причастным к этому шедевральному контенту! Кен, феномен, талант и неоспоримая легенда! Покойся с миром...
Supercars don’t have anything on this
Gone in the physical form but never ever forgotten. We love and miss you Ken. Thank you for being you man.
dios te tenga en la gloria idolo
Shout out to the editor for making it look like kens tires make the world go round!
They say in heaven u get a mansion but i hope kens came with his hoonicorn and a hella rad track may he full send in eternal life ❤
Hate how this thing sounds like a fart can in The Crew Motorfest
this man changed the world
He will surely be missed what an innovator no one has even come close to wheel man with his ability to shred the wheels off anything
Царство небесное легенда❤❤❤😢
I'm tearing up watching this footage... Thank you Ken for being amazing and I hope your daughter keeps the torch going!
Ken: How many tires do we have Hoonigan: All of 'em Ken: Say no more (mice drop)
JUCA
RIP! it still baffles me that of ALL the crazy things he's done, it's a snow mobile that gets him 🥺
Still doesn't seem real. KB 4ever
he will certainly be missed #KB43VER
V8…🥲
He was here for a good time, not a long time. It was one hell of a good time though.
Got me in the feels on this one.  Gone too soon.  #KB43ver
❤😢
Un orgullo que Juca aparezca en este vídeo, me preguntó que sintió al momento que sintió al colaborar con unos de los más grandes en el automovilismo??
Press F😢 forever in our 💕
What a legend!!!
Ter GG lah Ken, bakalan rindu gymkhna 🎉
RIP LEGENDDD🤟

Ken always in my heart
Absolute Legend. RIP KB
#KB43VER
RIP Ken Block, you were and are an absolute legend of the entire automotive community and will be missed dearly.
As much as I dislike EV cars, it was really fitting that this was silent.
Definitivamente vivió una vida tan emocionante y tan a su manera que ha inspirado a mucha gente, aun recuerdo la emoción que sentí cuando vi por primera vez el #GYMKHANA con su Focus, vuela alto Ken dejaste la vara muy alta #kb43ver
Un orgullo ábrelo tenido en CDMX, ahora es toda una leyenda, y felicidades para juca.
Ken Block fuiste el mejor nunca te olvidaremos
El goat del drift ever 💯🔥 rest in peace 🕊️
It’s crazy how the videos at the end from 2012-2014 feel like a year ago. R.I.P Ken Block 43Ver
And heres end the Golden era
KB43VER
This is the embodiment of what living your best life looks like. Ken did what he loved and it just so happened to be his job too.   I had hoped to meet him one day but sadly that day can never be in this life. RIP The game will never be the same with out you. Ride In Paradise
Didn't think I was gonna cry today but here we fucking are
Still hurts
Every time I see Ken my heart sinks....Even just his name. I was never into rally or anything but Ken was unique. RIP mate.
But It's Not Orange?????
RIP KB

This man was a absolute legend and hero to so many! RIP Ken!
Thats amazing. RIP Ken Block - Neal

Gone but never forgotten.❤

Legendary man. I’ll never forgot how mind blown I was the first time I saw Gymkhana! ❤
Кен Блок: Спасибо за все, за эти невероятные фильмы, приятно видеть, что канал не заброшен.  В конце этой Джимханны я, честно говоря, прослезился 🥲 #KB43VER
IMMORTAL❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
RIP to a legend..........these electric cars just dont do it for me.
He's a great driver sure....but can we appreciate his sense of style too? Makes sense considering how he started, and I don't think he's had a car that wasn't done up to look amazing as well. RIP
Vengo de ver el video del JUCA y tremenda joya 🎉❤ los sueños se hacen realidad, llore de emoción :')
RIP Ken, will always have legendary status in the car scene! Legends never die 💚 #KB43ver
❤️❤️
RIP descansa en paz
donuts and big slides. every rally driver can do those tricks

Vamos Jucaaaa❤❤
Juca  y bocho de lujo❤❤
#KB43VER
Not much to say other than God bless this man. He had every ambition combined perfectly with the likes of other drivers. So glad you guys released this.
Мне одному этот свист давит на уши? видео вырубил после 3х минут просмотра, ни одна электричка не заменит по эпичности ДВС!!!!
Tearing as i watch this😢 we miss u Ken!
Driving is impressive but what’s more impressive is that they managed to clear out Mexico City streets to do this. It’s like clearing out Manhattan or LA.
RIP Ken Block
Nada más que decir, un profesional en su área lo extrañamos
Thank You Ken!  🥲😔😝
Finally, no people complain about electric cars. If they were enough for Ken to smile, they are more than enough for everyone else
Montage at the end had me tearing up, respect!
There will never be another like Ken Block. Fuckin SEND IT
RIP KEN 🖤
I can’t man it sound and looks like a big ass R/C car🤣      🫵🫵ken we miss you man r.I.p. 😢🙏
E-Tron sound is eerie but is < Hoonicorn sound. R.I.P Ken
A true legend, and will be forever missed. Thank you so much for sharing your passion! What a badass!! ❤
Long live Ken Block! #43 legendary 🔥
Watching this Scotto & block actually were like brothers, sad year for the boys especially Scotto

Miss the hoonicorn sounds, just like nothing is the same without Ken, racing without the noise isn't the same.
I still remember watching the first vids with the STI
See you when I get there, cowboy. 🕊
Juca eres el mejor!!!
Final vid in a Audi I’m not crying 😭
Yawn... so boring I can't even watch hearing a car that sounds like my kids RC car. Electric cars are even worse for the environment and look at all the sheep eat it up XD!!
RIP
That last compilation hit me in the feels, knowing we are likely never gonna see a video with Ken in this capacity. Rest in peace.. A legend of youtube and the sport. <3
Thank you Ken. Thank you.
rest well Ken, HOOOOON
Only Ken can shut down an entire airport 😂 We'll never forget you, man #KB43VER

Love you ken. Always loved watching you with my dad growing up and saying "WHATTT!!!" at every clip. You nover lost that. Watched this one final time with my dad and we both thought this was awesome ❤❤❤❤ KB 43VER
It's one of the best things to do in a car.
I thought this guy died ? No ?
The best ever to do, R.I.P Ken.
Thank you for having been in my country Mexico...you simply were, you are and you will be great wherever you are...Thank you for such a beautiful show.   Gracias por haber estado en mi pais Mexico...simplemente fuiste, eres y seras un grande sea donde que estes...Gracias por tan bello espectaculo.
RIP ken man 😕🩷

In memoriam
Ken is such a legend. I wish all the best for his family and Lia's legacy filling her fathers footsteps, and push the limits further an further like her father Ken had done. His to inspire many generations an millions of people all over the world is an amazing feet.
Miss you Ken. So glad I got to meet you at LSPR.
I still can't believe that the Motorsport monster is no longer among us.  You will always be remembered not only for your deeds but for your way of being.  See you forever Ken
no batterys were harmed in this video
Such a loss, drift in peace Ken!
F*** electric cars ! No sound with these sh****
Fair play, he is the ballsiest driver ever, his control of a car is unpresedented, an outright genius and to do the gymkhanas myst have been a blast. Thank you to all involved. Rip legend #KB43VER
I think he lived one of the best lifes ever. KB43 4 ever <3
Una leyenda cerrando en el mejor pais de Latinoamerica Mexico!!! @jucaviapri eres un ejemplo de como se representa a Mexico con los grandes!!!  #KB43VER
😢
Y el Ford fiesta azul tirando de las cadenas brutal,y como le da😢❤
El juca bien feliz!!!🤍
Ken block is my childhood icon. Suck to know   hes gone. RIP KB!
The greatest! Will always be remembered!!!!
Was there ever a time when he didn't make a car work
Ken Block It lives in the hearts of all car-loving Mexicans❤❤
ken block forever!!🖤
😢😢😢
Rest in peace Ken Block. I'm sure your peace is racing around heaven impressing all the angels and the man himself! You will always be remembered and deeply missed.
5:08 Wow fantastic
The best that ever lived ❤‍🔥
😭
That guy man… that guy
We love you Ken. 😪
Truly appreciate having to see him behind the wheel one more time.  RIP LEGEND #kb43ver
This video didn't give me any emotion. Probably because of the electric car. The worst of all.
Putin ça craint mais bon c'est l'audi étron alors pas de surprises. RIP ken
Dang. Never been teary eyed at the end of Gymkhana film before. I remember getting so excited and watching the newest Gymkhana film as soon as it came out. You've done so much for the community and inspired countless people to chase their dreams. Thank you, Ken.
RIP LEGEND
❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Pica el buen juca en el vocho
Still such a loss to the racing world! I would have loved to see what he could do working with Audi again after so long at Ford and so many builds that could have been! ❤ Will miss seeing his ideas come to life, the man was a showman on and off the track and every build just proves that!
JUCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
RIP to a fucking LEGEND
im criyng..;(
Tus fans mexicanos siempre te recordaremos y te llevaremos en nuestros corazones. Eres una leyenda y tu buena vibra siempre perdurará. Un saludo a todo el equipo de Hoonigan y esperamos más de sus locuras aquí en México... Hasta siempre Ken Block... ❤
legend.
Merci
I love the no music - just car drifting ❤
We will miss you, RIP KEN. You shall always be remembered. #KEN43EVR
Ese auto es una bestia
RIP Legend!
43 - made a song dedicated to him on my recent album.  Will always love his passion and the skills he displayed everytime behind the wheel. Adrenaline rush everytime. Love everything he did.
Rest in peace Legend. Sad to say but his last Gimkhana on an electric car is something that makes me even more sad.
❣❣❣❣❣❣ KB43XEVER 🕊🕊🕊🕊
Que fregon ver al juca en el ultimo video de el buen ken
Спасибо за память, он был лучшим из лучших..
Ken block will forever be the gymkhana king 😔  But this just doesn't give the same feeling that all the other gymkhana videos gave it feels more like a giant RC ripping around then again else  Which yes the car is basically a  giant RC car
from santafe to polanco in 1 second... you wish
If the future is this... I prefer die today!!  No engine sound , no emotion!! Si esto es el futuro, prefiero morirme ya!!! Menuda porquería,...
Ken Block is such an amazing driver. He went for living legend to legendary legacy. He definitely left his mark on the world and will absolutely be missed. Thanks to the whole HOONIGAN team for all your hard work over the years. The world won’t be the same without Ken Block
#kb43ver
Rest in peace, Sir.
Хорошую жизнь прожил! Хоть и короткую... От души ебурил)
Легенда будет жить вечно! Как всегда, бесподобно!
Ken single handedly got me into cars and the world of drifting more than any other content creator I have watched. He was an inspiration to a lot of us and His passing was felt all around the world. KB43ver.
@jucaviapri 🇲🇽🥇🥇🚘🚗🏎
Dope💯
Hearing tires and no engine reminds me of being in the San Francisco Bay area. All these losers just cutting their catalytic converters. But you still can't hear a thing.
😂😂😂 You can see where he rehearsed all of his runs.  He will never be Colin McRae.
Forever in our hearts, send it always ❤
RIP Block.
Gracias por el contagio más grande de la vida de muchos el contagio de amor a los carros, a crear cosas locas que no son imaginables a la mente de muchos, gracias por esas acrobacias que enamoran y solo dan ganas de repetirlas, gracias por que nos enseñaste a muchos que si tienes una idea única y loca para plasmarla en un auto solo hazlo y ya y el mundo con sus opiniones que se muevan al carajo, gracias Ken por existir 43 por siempre ❤❤
Grande Ken y grande Juca. Magnífico video.
С Кен Блоком конечно не сравнить....
Jucaaaaaa ❤
El sonido no se escucha😅
I love Travis and he is an amazing driver but this is the last TRUE Gymkhana video we will ever see...
Even though it is so impressive and amazing skills, the petrol engine cars which he played with  are way better,
砖叔我们永远缅怀你为赛车文化所做的伟大的一切。This should be in all languages.
🤢🤮
R.I.P. 😪K.B.😪😪 Even in the Azores you are and will always be a legend.
Mi ídolo 😭😭😭
Hasta siempre Ken 🫶🏻 🇲🇽
That can not be good for the tires.
Amazing, I love JUCA scene.  Great Job, great life, great Ken Block
Ken.... Lost but not forgotten...
Gonna miss you KEN God bless buddy :(
what's the song called
Grande Ken Block
The MAN the myth, the LEGEND!
KEN BLOCK FOREVER #KB43VER 🔥🔥🔥
Oglądałem jak byłem mniejszy oglądam teraz ostatni film z jego udziałem🥹🤌❤️‍🔥
R.I.P legend we will meet soonigan❤
I love Ken and I'll always miss him for his insane Hoonigan stunts. However this just feels like a high-budget Audi ad for electric cars. When I heard Ken has partnered with Audi I was extatic, but this just shows me Audi is in it for their electric cars sales and not the rally/drift passion that came from their Quattro breed of cars. This is incredibly hard for me to say as Ken is an absolute legend, but I haven't seen a single stunt in this that wouldn't scream 'We want to show off what electric motors can do'.
Cresciuto con i loro video ken rip
vengo para ver a #juca acabo de ver su video saludos desde colombia
Жаль дружище,ты лучший...❤
Ken Block still alive???????
Rip Ken ❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
RIP GOAT
Definitivamente nunca me voy a olvidar del primer video que vi de Ken en el Subaru azul, creo que tenía unos 12 años más o menos y ya quería ser grande para driftear como el jajaja.  Espero que donde sea que esté lo acompañe esa sonrisa tan característica suya 🥹
Han quitado el sonido al video?
Amazing he will forever be a legend.
🐐
4:10 Até ele acha que vai levar a pancada.  Um monstro! Que descanse em paz. Seu legado está vivo e maravilhosamente registrado para a posteridade.
Ken Block sempre será a lenda 🔥❤️ Que seus erros e acertos sirvam de inspiração e motivação aos novos pilotos para se tornarem tão bons e insanos quanto
Absolute perfection. RIP Ken Block. 🙏
😓😭😭😭😭 this video has a grown man crying, thank you Ken
please do this in Sao Paulo, the largest city of the western hemisphere, and also my hometown.
savage from the 1. to the last one!!!!!

He’s an absolute legend in motorsport RIP….
Im not sure why people say these are his contributions when its US the consumer whos money goes into paying for this stuff bc this drink company makes too much.
We all miss him
Man That Car is sick!!! ❤
Thank you guys so much must’ve been difficult pushing this out

Жаль, крутой чел был😢
A rally car with no sound??  It’s like life without Kenny!!  Miss you Ken!!!
Hope one day sony will make a game with him
Hard to watch his face still alive, qnd to n the next moment..., but I'm sure he lived the live in full speed. Some people for 100 years can't have his life.
Respect Ken !
We will never forget u Ken...
Another emotional moment seeing Ken on his very last Gymkhana. Chills man chills. What a legend! #KB43VER
Long live ken 🤟🤟
You're missed Ken!!
Mexico: How much money are you willing to spend? Audi: Yes! R.I.P. Ken.

Merci... 1000x merci KB43 for everything. #KB43VER
Bro, está lloviendo 😢
❤
Rest in peace Mr.Block. Thank you for some of the best memories from the past that many of us have.
Legends never FUCKIND die, they just move to a safer place watching over us!
I think I speak for a lot of people when I say, thank you for this. Ken Block will go down in history as an auto sport legend. Now our gaize falls upon his daughter to fill those shoes. No sweat kiddo, you got this, send it.
So strange to not see the municipales driving around lazily with their light bars running 24/7 seeking out victims to extort. This can’t be Mexico
grande juca

This one was hard. I just watched it after waiting a few days. I had watched his last video he posted the night before he passed.

😇🇦🇷😍
4:23 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[ 5:53 ]:
This video made my whole family cry. Especially when you guys kept flashing between Lia/Leah (spelling?) and Ken in the car. My 14 year old son was even in tears at the end. Ken has left a lasting impact even in our youths that can’t even drive! RIP Ken.
The world feels just a little bit less bright.
❤
NICE  AWES0ME KINGDOM OF HEAVENS KEN BLOCK REST IN PEACE  🎉✨🎉✨🎉🎉🎎🎭🎎🎭🎎🎭🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑✨🎆
#1 - the behind-the-scenes videos are great. You get to see a lot of peoples true selves. It would be cool if Hoonigan put out a 30 minute video with lots of the behind-the-scenes clips from all of these events.  #2 - It was funny to see Ken Block’s face in the car squint and grit his teeth right before he made impact with a curb or the barrier in the video. He knew it was coming before it even happened. ha ha  #3 - This is where all the kids are going to whine about this or that and tell me to get with the times. But watching the Electrikhana series doesn’t have the same S O U L as the previous Gymkhana series. Hearing the engines roar to life and spit fire is part of the story, and adrenaline rush that hearing an electric sewing machine whine doesn’t provide. This is evident in the fact that performance car companies are attempting to introduce fake mechanical sounds into the cabin of electric cars now.  You hear about famous people passing everyday. Most of the time it’s just another name. In my line of work I deal with it a lot. As a hobbyist that has done/attempted some of these stunts on very small scale as a kid, I appreciate what Ken Block did for the industry and this era of enthusiast, and was a little choked up. The “what if’s” will always be running in the back of my head. Best wishes to Ken Blocks family.
Fui el único que se quedó leyendo los créditos buscando a Juca?
🇲🇽👌🏼#KB43EVER🫶🏼😶‍🌫️
at 3:32, whoever idea it was to get the hydro brake and axle lock shot, 11/10.
Вечная память!
R.I.P Legend 😢
ken, you are forever in our hearts, everything you did impacted us, we will remember how incredible you were and how happy you made us with your GYMKHANA. I hope to see more of your adventures in the other world.
Thank you guys. Your work is awesome, and forever in our hearts. Ken 💔Rest in peace, Legend. #KB43VER
Le seul homme qui ne faisait qu'un avec la voiture ! 😫😞
Ken was the reason why I love so much cars, drift, and the iconic subaru
IM NOT CRYING AT WORK YOU ARE😭
Rest in peace legend ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
JUCA JUNTO AL MEJOR KEN BLOCK
camera person flinched at 4:22 lol pussy
My God - Imagine being in one of those vehicles, on the overpass, seeing this absolute madman, this genius, this hoonigan for horsepower, belting along underneath you, at mad speeds, often sideways... while you're doing the speed limit (😉)  What an experience !  RiP Ken Block.  The world will miss this absolutle beast of a driver, a guy that continued to push the envelope, when it came to what was achievable, in the car.  From burnouts on 2 wheels, to losing a wheel but still pushing... (My favourite was Gymkhana 9, the when he dropped a wheel over the edge of the Dock... that was pure porn, for the extreme vehicle sports fanatics.  And let's be serious, if you're a follower of the madness of Ken block, then you CAN be classed as  fanatic.  His daughter Lia, is now following in her dad's footsteps. (What better teacher could you ever EVER hope to have). She has already become the youngest winner of 2WD open series championship, in her first year. Brings a tear to my eye, that Ken will not be able to witness all that she is going to achieve. Already signed up to the Williams driver academy, surely great things to come from this young lady. Although Ken isn't here, I'm sure the ground rules he instilled into Lia, will keep her grounded, while pushing 110%, at the same time.  Ken Block We will miss you.
Than you for doing it one last time in the motherland 🇲🇽. Rest in paradise Ken. We miss you buddy
Легенды не умирают, они уходят в Высшую Лигу #KB43ver
I was going through some of my old clothes a couple days ago and found and old Hoonigan T, timing, man. I don’t even know what to say. Tears. Thanks crew, thanks Ken. Thanks for so many awesome years of inspiration. Shred that great beyond.
Rip Mr block one of the best drivers the world has ever seen absolute class skills
Wooooow! Ken was from another plannet
Its like a giant rc car, lol.
#KB43EVER
RIP
🥹😭🫶
I always loved these gymkhana videos by Ken but this electro stuff has no apeal at all to me. Had to quit watching after 2 minutes 🤷‍♂
Still absolutely gutted he’s gone. A year nearly!! My ❤ sinks every time I watch his videos and hearing that laugh. 😢
juste incroyable !!! rip Mr Block
🥲Que ton âme repose en paix Ken ta magie fera rêver des milliards d'enfants pour les millions d'années qu'il reste à l'humanité tu seras avec nous pour l'éternité👍🙏🤟🫡
Audi otomobil ile çekilmiş bir aksiyon olmasına rağmen, Ken Block'a saygı ve anma amacı ile video sonunda bir çok anıya yer verilmesi ve görüntüleri bozmamak adına, sponsor olmayan markaların bile açıkça gösterilmesi büyük bir jest olmuş. Bu açıdan bakarak, başta auidi olmak üzere videodaki sponsor markaları taktir ettim. İlk videolardan bu güne kadar ne kadar çok zaman geçmiş, hiç farkında değildim. Zaman çok hızlı geçiyor, büyüyoruz, yaşlanacağız ve (R.I.P. Ken Block...) öleceğiz...
this was the worst one so far, i cant get behind electric cars, not the same epic feeling or sound.
Tribute to a legend.
The last was better with ford ...
Should've been posted in January
Rest in peace.
I’m here thanks to @juca #juca
⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
I came from Juca's video  We miss you Ken 🙏
One one 😂
Ken rip 🎉
Fr : Ken fut pour moi et comme les personnes dans les commentaires (sauf @thetruth6417 le mec sans cœur et cerveaux) une source d'inspiration j'ai commencé à le suivre via Gymkhana 3 et depuis j'ai considéré comme une idole à chaque gymkhana j'était présent pour voir Ken brulé de la gomme mais quand j'ai appris son décès j'étais dépité et attristé et malheureusement la saga des gymkhanas se termine suite à sa disparation il y'a un an reposez en paix Mr Block  🕊🕊 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ En:Ken was for me and like people in the comments (except @thetruth6417 the guy without heart and brains) a source of inspiration I started following him via Gymkhana 3 and since then I considered him an idol at every gymkhana I was present to see Ken burned gum but when I learned of his death I was disappointed and saddened and unfortunately the saga of the gymkhanas ends following his disappearance a year ago rest in peace Mr Block 🕊🕊
エンジン音が無いと何か物足んないな〜
I've never been really into the Hoon-game (had other things in my mind), but I enjoyed every Gymkhana you guys and Ken realised through out the years - it's a worthy last Gymkhana of Ken Block and the montage in the end hits pretty solid; R.i.P. Ken, thank you and the hoon crew for this excellent content and memories  <3
RIP, out of control, yet so in control of everything. Will miss him.
woow
Ken and everyone at hoonigan we love you all so much and thank you for all the amazing gymkhana video. We miss you and love you ken❤️❤️
Rest easy Ken #43
Goodbye, Ken. You have been a major inspirational force through my life, and it just won't be the same without you.
Gone but never forgotten. Ken would be proud.
oh man, i cried so much in the end.
Русская фанатская аудитория Кена никогда не забудет его. Он вдохновлял десятки тысяч людей своим управлением гоночного автомобиля. Вечная память и уважение.
I fell asleep, it is impossible to watch the entire video without audio, I mean without combustion sound… Ken Block forever ❤
Its like strange that the last movie is in electric car- new world. Hope youre in better place LEGEND

Must admit as epic as this is. That electric scratching is not good down the headphones 😂. It won’t ever be quite the same without an engine or ken
"There will never be another one like Ken Block" ......Just don't tell Lia Block that. RIP KB43 4-Ever
Will always be the goat.
43ver
It is not the same as hearing an engine roaring! It just sounds like a stupid RC car. Gasoline Forever!!!!
Я хочу стать кен блокам
muy bueno
If there ever is a more worthy send off to an absolute legend it has to be this video. Still can’t believe we will never be able to see his incredible driving anymore. You will be missed but never gone R.I.P Ken Block
KEN BLOCK🔥 JUCA🔥
Ken will continue to live on in our memories... 4Ever
Wonderful tribute to Ken. He will be missed, just like the angry engine noises
Кен блок жив ?
I'm so happy we get to see more of Ken. And also sad

4:21 Did Ken Block just flinch?! No effing way!
What a legend
Нет! Не то пальто! (((
it sounds like the jetsons flying car
Much love and respect and rest in Peace to the goat, Ken block.
The man that was not a myth, damn sure a legend. A gearhead among gearheads and an inspiration in the world, he lived the life worth living and lived it for all to see. He left not just a legacy, but also a lineage that will carry on the passion he is so boldly shared. Thank you, Ken, Bryan, and hoonigan for one last ride. Thank you for the masterfully choreographed automotive art that has been gymkhana.
The World will miss you forever! R.I.P❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sim... todos choramos assistindo
Battery cars .... are annoying !!
RIP.  It is sad irony that at least two great drivers were claimed by snow sports accidents; not a safety reminder I was happy to receive.
Wherever you are Ken... Mexico is always your home!! ❤

I wish her daughter takes over the channel. ❤❤
Great final tribute to Ken and all he’s done.   But damn the electric car sounds are like fingernails on a chalkboard
I grew up watching this man and kobe. It hit hard when I found out they are gone 💔
Sorry I love Ken,but you gotta have the scream of a gas engine...
The credits at the end gave me chills. RIP Mr. BLOCK. Looks like Lia will have no problem carrying on the Legacy. KB43VER ❤❤❤

Miss you Ken I wish we could see you celebrate the year coming to a close and I wish I could have seen you retire one day and watch how amazing your daughter is and will be. Rest In Peace Mr. Block.
Faz muito falta o Ken block ele e  lenda , jamais será esquecido.
I get nervous about scratching my rims in the drive thru……
a great tribute to a man we will never forget
Man that is a awesome way to honor Ken Block the first gymkana video is saw i remember i told may grandfather look at this crazy dude in his fiesta and since then i was hooked on what he could do with a car such a legend. #KB43VER
To see over 1000 dislikes makes me sick. What is wrong with some of you people?! The disrespect is filth. This man only gave to us, he took nothing and gave everything! Have some respect! #43ver
Master of his craft. Hoon in peace KB43
Never met the man but he meant alot to me. I was 11 when I first found the first video in the subaru and I watched them with my dad and every christmas I asked for a Ken block pair of DC's or a 43 hoodie im 23 now and ballin my eyes out. #KB43VER
JUCAAAAAAA Y KEN ❤
Царство небесное тебе <3
Wtf is this vacuum cleaner man hahahaha
the fact that ken's gone but we still get to see this masterpiece is unimaginable...rip man, the best to ever do it
this film was lovely n all just like the rest, but what i find odd is that there was no RIP or condolences what so ever for the man who made this a thing, idk kinda odd to me.
A beast will never be forgotten Ken block. 🙏🙏

We gonna miss this guy for ever! Descanse em paz, Ken! 🇧🇷 #KB43VER

A final sendoff to the great legend that was Ken. His last Gymkhana ever and he did it as flawless and amazing as ever. Been almost a year since his passing and yet he’s still sending shockwaves throughout the car community. Through his great projects in racing, Hoonigan and of course his infamous gymkhanas. And of course we still miss him. Shred em tires off in paradise Ken! ❤️ #KB43ver
Без Кенблока уже не то
A Masterpiece. Again.

I saw this car in my country in a tuning show called amts. It was incredible to see ken's last gymkhaana car! R.I.P!😢
#KB43VER, RIP LEGEND.
4:21 That look on his face when he thought he was going to smack the planter.
Сложно переоценить работу, эмоции - которые подарил мне Ken Block и его команда минувшие 14 лет. Синоним имени этого человека - Легенда! Облака делают дрифтеры, теперь это про него к сожалению😢 P. S. С Русскоязычного фаната Кена Блока по лайку.
It wasn't a *khana unless Ken broke something. 😎#AintCare #KB43ver
Thank you KB!!!!
First time i'm happy to watch a video with electric cars :( RIP
Always been awesome! Gone but never forgotten👍
always a legend makes the best videos ever but i stilll hate eletric always 🤣🤣🤣🤣
De parte de mi Juca saludos el tuning nunca muere ✌️✌️
He was having fun. Now we're having fun seeing him going crazy and thinking about the passion he shared with us. Life is too short to drive boring vehicles
❤
Фигня какая-то !электричка вообще не подходит для таких роликов  И трюки раньше были интересней
These cars dont hit like the fords. Miss Ken tho
Muito obrigado ken🎉😅  Sempre sorrindo😊 Luz❤

I am not a Electric Car Fan But The First Time I Saw This One In Vegas I LOVED IT AND THE SOUND IT MAKES IT OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! Thank You Hoonigan For Sharing This LEGENDS LAST RIDE!!! It made my hair stand up and my Heart Beat So Fast Seeing Him In That Masterpiece Of A Car And Put On A Masterpiece Of Driving!!!

형.. 나는 형이 좋아. 나는 한국사람이고 서킷도 좋아하자만 고갯길.. 와인딩에 7년을 팀을 꾸리고  진심으로 살았지..  어느순간 형을 알게되며 나는 더 미친듯 운전하게됐어. 그래서 정말 나름 인정받는 와인딩어가 됐지. 형은.. 전설이야.. 내가 형을 만나면.. 말하고싶어. 캔블락 썬글라스 쓰고 형한테.. 택시 드라이버 해주실수있어요??
What a driver, what a talent. The world misses you Ken. RIP bro

Ride In Peace Ken ❤ thanks for making these awesome videos
Honestly, I love what Ken did to WRC, and as a Rally fan I miss him very much. But this... this is boring. Racing without SOUND of the internal combustion engine. Best of this wideo comes from 8:22  RIP Ken Block
Drift in peace 🖤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Only ken block could make an electric car sound good ❤
Ken will forever be one of the most amazing men who ever lived! He found and showed us the edge of what is possible, if you put your mind to it! You will always be loved and missed, Ken...i hope they have drift cars in heaven.
Тяжеловата машинка.Видно как трудно удержать на траектории.

What a timeless video. God rest his spent rubber and soul.
Thank you for sharing this! There’s no one like Ken #43
Juca aparece con el mitico Ken Block waaao
Legends never die!!! Eternal memory!!!
Y'all forgot about the Top Gear UK khanas too
I somehow missed a lot of these, I guess more content to watch :) rip to the legend
esa risa orgullosa que pone Ken cuando regresa a ver a Juca lo dice todo un hombre que sabe que contagio su amor por los autos a millones y que esta viendo a uno de ellos que creció viéndolo justo allí y sabe que esta allí gracias a el. Gracias Ken Block por inspirar a una generación.
Legend you will be missed 😢
Ver a kenblock en mexico una de las leyendas al volante es algo muy prestigioso (Vengo de Juca)
I"m here for @juca
it looks so cool it seems so cool but i miss car sound. electro make me sad but the vibes and sounddesigns are perfect. i miss Ken block..
This man changed the world of Motorsports and the standard of which we now consider balls of steel…. RIP 43 😢
RIP Ken Block! The world lost a legend! #KB43VER
Youre the man Ken, may your legend live on 43VER #KB43VER
Electric is uh,......well just boring and ugly lol. Oh well.
4:08 mi youtuber favorito @Juca en el video de autos por excelencia 🎉 junto a Ken Block cerrando los ojos y saliendo limpio 🤯👌👏🏻
Good to see Ken one last time
The montage at the end hit hard. Crazy to think I spent so many years watching these videos and this will be the last one.  #KB43VER
Enjoy the ride
Unfortunately this e-whining is miles away from a proper roar 😢
The real DK ❤
Some skills to be sure, but what a dinosaur. Hopefully, that's just the marketing... Oh, wait...
Absolutely za legend - thanks Ken Block ❤
Incredible
We will  never forget you kb43ver you are the best driver in the world thank you for give me the love for this sport and love for cars ❣️ ❤
Esto con un coche de verdad a combustion seria la mejor despedida...lastima que se fuera con un electrico, estos coches estan matando a los coche de verdad, de los que realmente amamos los coches.
Love u Ken. gl hf in the after drift life Sir.
Amazing!!! #KB43VER 🙏🏼🔥🤍🖤💚
We’ll miss you Ken, every rally, every crash, every time you risked your life, you became more and more of a legend. I’m glad we got to see his last gymkhana, fly high legend🕊️♥️❤️  #KB43VER
Montage at the end only reiterated how much Electrikhana 1&2 failed to hit the excitement level and risk that all of the others met.  Massive amounts of tire smoke can't save you.  Can't wait to see what Lia does, hope she continues with the petrol powered stuff.
What a legend
Arriba hoonigan, Ken block y JUCA
💚💚🤍🤍❤❤
superb
God bless the hooniking!!
It just goes to show how much sound has a effect on wot you are watching.  I turned it off after 30 seconds 😢😢rip Ken.
Can smbd explain me please, HOW the hell they can stop the hole traffic, even the airport, so nobody there ?? How is it possible?? Ken, we will remember you forewer!!!
guys, hearing Ken's laugh at :46 could make a grown man cry. we will always miss you buddy. long live 43

Long live ken Block!!!
Ughhhh this is such a bitter sweet gymkhana film. I have loved watching you since I was a kid and part of the reasons I have gotten into cars was because of you and your brand Hoonigan. I was so heartbroken as I know millions were to hear of your passing and it’s so hard to lose someone who had such a huge impact on motorsports. I will forever cherish the memories of watching you kill all tires everywhere forever. Thank you for bringing us so much joy and being such a badass behind the wheel. Thank you for always pushing the limit and most of all. Thank you for being Ken Block. We all will miss you🏎️💨🏎️💨🏎️💨🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
Larga vida al rey  👑
Saludos a Juca, por siempre recordado Ken Block ✊🏻🇨🇴

RIP Ken Block, you gave me and many others plenty of entertainment and excitement for us motor enthusiasts, inspired a lot of people.
Ken Block truly changed the way we see rally and Gymkhana. He will be remembered forever through the tire marks he left, and the smoke trails. He will be missed 43ver. #KB43VER
Hombre escuchar motor y ver drift, hombre ser feliz 🦍
Grande Juca 💪🏻
The highlight reel at the end was perfect. All respect to you Ken, you kickstarted whole new era of automotive enthusiasm. Rest in peace.
This is not a sad video but here I am weeping and watching my hero just have a good  time. A hero and a dare devil went out a dare devil's death.  I  hpope for him and his family that it was quick and painless but it is nice knowing he was having the the time of his life up until the end.
🏎️💨.  🥇🙏
😭💔
Absolutly inspiring. What a life Ken lived!
El AIFA esta tan vacio que no lo tuvieron que cerrar y estaba operando con normalidad
When people refer to people being the goat. Ken Block was truly the G.O.A.T. !!! We all will miss you, the man, the myth, the LEGEND!!🤘🏻

by juca
KB is a ledgend and one of the best! However this car sucks. No noise. No soul. Kinda boring. Should have had the 5 cylinder in it!
Don't get me wrong,electric car is sick. You just can't beat the sounds of a pist off turbo 4 cylinder or twin turbo v8. Rip Ken Block
@juca !sali en la portada!!!
Absolute Legend
I had a feeling that this film was only on pause. This will be a very welcome tribute to the great legend and legacy that Blocks family has set in stone. Great work and best wishes moving forward to the Block family.
The end being set to one of my favorite Matt and Kim songs made me quite emotional. There is not a metric to measure the inspiration I have gained from these videos. Its made me feel less alone. I'll be eternally grateful for the energy Ken and the Hoonigan team have brought to this world.
im sure that ken would be very proud of what his daughter is accomplishing. #KB43VER
ohh men, estou muito velho, me lembro de 2009 =x  Tks Ken. We will miss you
Wow!!!!!   I know that you are gone, but your legacy will live on. RIP Ken Block 😢 #KB43VER

Thank you for always showing us and teaching us what it means to be passionate about motorsport and what good and radical things it can bring to our lives, thank you for being a big part of our lives Ken
Asta luego hermano ❤😎👍🏼 #KB43VER 🙏❤
He was truly a gifted driver!
Absolutely amazing💜🙌⚡️
Not quite as good as Jari-Matti Latvala, Carlos Sainz or the GOAT Colin McRae, but he was very skillful and passionate, no doubt a legend in the MotorSport world.
You are a Car hero. You made anything possible. RIP The LEGEND!
only one ken block will truely be missed
I was born in Mexico City he’s last video in my hometown make me cry 😢
RIP Travis

#teamjuca
Rip ken ❤ i honestly had to stop watching Hoonigan when you left, it will never be the same without you. You inspired me to be a better version of myself and i still struggle with my own loss
Very good performance by ken. But the electric motor sound suuuuuuuuuucks. No exhaust sound or turbo. Just squealing electric motors. I hope this is not the feature.
Gracias ken Block ❤‍🩹
We miss You bro
I remember discovering the subaru videos back in the 2000s and got an impreza as my first car because of it, never slow down KB43ver
RIP🤍 the One and Only K.BLOCK
Those poor tires never stood a chance 🏎️💨 What a legend #KB43VER

Este video es hermoso el JUCA, El AIFA y el todo poderoso KEN BLOCK hasta el cielo
♥♥♥♥
Hearing his chuckle as he sits in the Hoonitron before the run… wild that he had no clue this was his last Gymkhana style film… It’s good medicine seeing him shred tires
We Miss you KEN! You will be remembered 4 EVER! Love You!
Love this man! What a legend! You will be missed Ken! RIP
Grande mi Juca❤❤
K.B 43ver in our hearts ! Never forget ❤❤❤🇨🇵🇺🇲
JUCAAAAAA
gracias por todo
Wao that was just incredible. Thank you Ken! 😭
Wtf juca? 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 cumpliste literalmente sueño de miles de personas que ya no lo podrán hacer grandeeee❤
Me acuerdo de conocer a Ken Block por el Dirt 3, desde ese momento me volví totalmente fanático de él y de todo lo que hacía, me motivó mucho a aprender sobre autos y el drift, el es sin dudas el mejor
sedih bgt sih doi dah gaada😢
Debe estar revolcándose en su tumba... que porquería los autos eléctricos. Son el futuro y todo lo que quieran pero no son para esto.
Got me tearing up now...
Grande el juca en el video
We miss you, ken. Every f*ckin day #KB43VER
World record for longest consecutive burnout?  You are missed Ken, even by those who you never knew.
Will forever be the best race car driver in the world, and will forever be one of my inspiration❤️
All the feels Ken, you're an icon, a legend, and stole our hearts forever. #KB43VER
We miss you ken 😢
I should say we will always miss you Ken. KB43ver....This was hard to watch but i hope it helps us all with closure.

Drift Legend
single handedly brought rally into the lime light and took it out in the same lifetime lul
isnt this guy dead ?
did he died
I put Rotiform wheels, with Michelin PS4s, on my new Audi last summer.  It seemed like the very least I could do.
RIP Ken Block... This last Gymkhana is a gift to see and after this year you'll always be the greatest showman making this series.

The greatest stuntdriver to ever live.
God bless you Ken and your family I’m glad your daughter is following right be hind you rest easy legend

Покойся с миром легенда! 😢Не забудем тебя 🙏
Охуенно
Press F
No doubt Ken driving skills were impeccable, but with an electric car in the sounds that is making its annoying give me an engine that runs on gas
RIP Legend. Thank you for inspiring us.
Godspeed Ken.   Thanks for all the entertainment.
It’s unreal how calm he looks behind the wheel while doing these insanely difficult maneuvers. So so so impressive. Rest in peace Ken. #KB43VER
Thank you ken for all the amazing memories. You blessed this world. Alot of people look up to you and are inspired. You will be missed. We all love you!

I cried watching this 😢❤❤❤RIP Ken
Never thought I would be so happy and so sad at the time to see a gymkhana video . RIP Ken you will be forever missed.
KB forever!

RIP KEN
Truthfully I haven’t been a fan for long. But I don’t think it takes that much time to instantly realize how much of an absolute icon this man was to the world of racing… R.I.P. #43 “Legends Never Die!”
Wow! An epic last run by the man 🎉
RIP
Drift in peace Ken 🕊️🕊️🕊️
We'll always miss you, Ken. Thank you for getting us stoked on cars and sharing your passion with everyone for all of those years. #KB43VER!
#KB43EVER
God i never thought i’d see anything like this again, this is truly a great way to keep him alive, but he will always live on in the car community and be with the ones that inspired them to get into the car world. it was Ken at pikes peak that got me incredibly hooked. And to that, Fly high 🪽
LEGEND!!!❤
0:00 I paused immediately just to say I cannot watch this. If I watch this then it's like he's truly gone and nothing new will come out from him ever again... I just cant.... RIP Ken
Great job Hoonigan Team and thank you block family for allowing us to enjoy this.
Literal mi piloto automovilístico favorito. La verdadera máquina al volante 🦾🤖🤙😎
Love and miss you Ken. This should’ve been just another dope ass, fun-loving ‘Khana video but if I’m being honest it just made me sad. I’m not the type to cry over celebrity deaths or anything like that but you were so much more than just a celebrity. You were (and still are) an inspiration, a true legend, the peak, the pinnacle, a stage 10 driver mod. Just an absolute beast in so many aspects of life. We miss you dearly down here, bud. I hope you’re somewhere shredding tires and ripping off silly body kits. KB43VER ❤
Bardzo mi się podobały filmy z tym gościem  to była zawsze świetna robota a oglądanie jego wyczynów dawało ogromną frajdę. Pozdrawiam serdecznie i ten facet zostanie w mej pamięci na długo.
electric automotive operators  and its potential radiation exposure .
Nice to see Ken again in his finest.  KEN BLOCK, REST IN PEACE
An absolute legend and a class act all the while!... The world could use some of Ken's humility these days... Forever missed!.. Impossible to ever be forgotten!..
R.I.P. 😞
I still get the same reaction as I’m seeing this for the first time, he was the greatest RIP Ken..
Very different without combustion. I like hearing cams and motor rev
legend!
Ken will be forever entwined in motorsports history as a legend...Watcging him since I was a kid, in my heart, he will never be forgotten. #rip43
Best wheelman ever. Miss you so much Ken. KB43VER. Thank you Hoonigan for letting us have this one. I know it wasn't easy.
He is the GOAT, nobody is better then him at driving. We will miss you deeply………
ken was truly an amazing person
😭😭😭😭😭😭 AROUND THE BASKET LIFT!!!!! REST IN PEACE. 🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
tears to my eyes, man i watched every Gymkhana video when they came out.. i graduated high school in 2009, so this was right in my car phase and growing up with cool cars. KB43VER Rest easy legend
legends never die, they should just make a movie of him.
Kens a amazing driver and will always be missed  but not hearing any insane backfires or turbos spoiling up kills the vibe of these
Why does an electric car have gears?
Idk know why but I always thought that if Batman was a real person it would be Ken Block
RIP Ken
RIP Legend, thanks for inspiring us and everyone in this comment section
Thank you for the memories😢. Gone but never forgotten.  God bless Block.  #hoonigan
One and only !! #KB43VER..  WE MISSED YOU !!
Rip Ken block. You were a hero to me man and will continue to be every day till the end of time.
Legend
Yup. I think I can't wait for the daughter to surpass
Can't believe this guy is gone 😢
<3 The ending has me in tears. This video will be treasured by thousands and thousands of people. Rest easy 43 <3
Thanks to Ken Block and all of his achievements in life. I'm still sad about his passing, but this video helped me see his awesome charisma and dedication as a driver. We will always remember you.
Miss you, brother. Tell Dale I can't wait to see ya'll on the track in heaven
Damn! Shut down a terminal!? Lol dudes a legend
El Rally es hermoso, pero cuando te conocí, se volvió épico. Gracias Ken❤
VEryy goood :) It's an amazing car!
ありがとう🥲
It sounds very strange without the engine noise
So Glad you guys put this last one out for the world.  One last chance for us all to revel In the Genius of the great man, who will never be forgotten! Thanks Ken.
Rest in peace,  great finale
true LEGENDS never die. God bless, and God speed.
Subaru 2008 >>>>> All
Goose bumps.. Love from Germany. Never forget u.
We all truly miss you Ken, I wish the best for his family and friends. #KB43VER
We miss ya 43 🫡😔 thank you Hoonigan for releasing this and especially doing it in Mexico as well 🇲🇽
Electric looks impressive but without that ICE wailing, it’s just not the same. The Mustang will always be the best from that perspective.
Truly, one of the greatest people on Earth to ever graced the art of the car. He will be missed but never forgotten.  #KB43VER
You were many people's childhood Ken Block you will never be forgotten 😢❤
Why is this the end why 😭
Ken set the tone, now it is time to follow and keep the legend alive. KEN KANA FOREVER......  History stand on the shoulders of giants, Ken Block was a giant, start climbing ....  Fun side: F1 driver radio..." I lost a tiny aero part"......Ken: muhahahaha   To family and friends: IT SUCKS...but there is a tomorrow and he will always be with you in your hearts.
RIP #43
Props to Mexico City, for hosting. I've always heard it was beautiful there, so it was great to see it featured. The route was like an invitation to visit. Very impressive. It looks like a lot to be proud of.  I feel like Ken and Hoonigan were trying to be ambassadors of all sorts.
Can’t get into electric autos… 🤮
Thank you!
The greath lord
What a legend 👏🥹🕊️
Man R.I.P to the goat. Such an influence with an everlasting imprint on motorsports.
View for Ken! Dislike for Electric Drive 💚 (Fan from the beginning 2006!)
ken, we love you, thanks <3
RIP legend #KB43VER
Man what a legend!!! You are so missed brother man. RIP
:(
One last trip around the Block. Miss your talent, Ken.
RIP legend❤
i wonder if ken's daughter will do the next gymkhana
43ver ❤ never forget!
No one will replace Ken Block #KB43VER
#KB43VER   We all miss you, Ken.
Кен, ты навсегда останешься с нами таким. Помним тебя и любим твоё умение управлять автомобилем.
🇲🇽 💚🤍❤
Ken showing us the true meaning of "Audi Airlines" ✨
All Love to the familiy. And to the team. I know what happend. I miss him. Let me say only one word for Ken. Miss ! >tears<
I wish the Hoonigan team had captured the footage in VR-capable camera equipment, so everyone can experience what it may be like sitting in the cockpit with Ken Block driving.
RIP Ken Block ❤
One of the greatest drivers I've seen. RIP Ken #kb43ver
Honestly surprised you guys didn't wait to drop this on 4/3 2024.
This is mental, like a full scale RC car! 😎
KB43VER ❤️‍🔥
Was soll der scheiß...Ki oder was...

As always great driving, but that car makes a God awful sound
Really Miss you Nice Crazy Dude, have fun, PS and as well Peace on the Rainbow Course´s !
💚🖤
This is so sad
Ken block is rolling in his grave ATM why would you sell his brain child  like wtf u say u are his brothers but sell out right away 😢 burning and removing all hoon shit off everything that I own u really are breaking people's hearts never again u losers specially u Brian Scotto sell out garbage brother
It's cool Ken can drive anything but him in the mustang was a piece of art ❤️💯🙏🏻
What a legend lost did so much for the sport and creating some absolute monsters with the team it seem like Leah is up and coming to walk his path of awesomeness
Thank you for everything Ken Block!💚
Thee Pioneer. May you forever race in paradise ❤
Knowing this is the last real gymkhana has me feeling all sorts of ways RIP KB43ver
Kb4ever
Just stunning as all that you did! Youre very missed but i hope you can do your amazing job further on, drawing donuts around gods chair up there where ever you are. Go along and show them above in a heavenkhana how the world really spin. Its all about the angle of attack while drifting. Ken Block, there is no other like him. Tom from Austria (europe)
The goat
It's such a pitty that's the last Gymhana was in an EV. There is way less fun watching such performance without engine sound.
The GOAT. Man we will miss you,
What an absolute legend!
#KB43VER 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Gracias por todo Ken Block 🤍#43forever
R.I.P. man, you always was inspiritaional in what you did and how you did it, showed off and raced. Now race in peace!🖤🖤🖤
The fact that this only has 190k for likes is criminal
Wow that was really hard to watch without having goosebumps the whole time 😢❤ Well done to Hoonigan and all associated partners to  create Ken Blocks final playground! Thank you Ken R.I.P 43VER
The soundtrack alone is a symphony close your eyes you will hear him in the wind 💨 🫶🏼 thoughts go out
RIP King Block 🏆👏 This gave me chills and I saw every move. Very nice work? Ken demolished it! The reverseys while in drift? Only Ken and I do that. Ken is the best there ever was, the best there is, and the best there ever will be. Rent free Forever and the Raddest Human Being from Earth. Ken Block  🚘 🤴
🖤43 🙏
A Legend 🫡❤️
Hoonigan was never the same
i dont think they could have done the ending any better well done. It make me fell sad how we will never get to see him drive again . May he fly high
The one and only!!!
😢😢😢😢😢 love you Ken
Game Changer, End credits gave me the chills, Always in our hearts
Personally think codemasters should create and release a Ken block drift/dirt game in homage  Ken block all the cars he's driven open world of different locations  A variety or challenges and possible scenarios.
That 360 during the roundabout drift was too good 😭
Can you please not let what he started die off. Please get other drivers to continue the dream.
Y que me topo al Juca con el super bocho.... 😮
WAS FAST !!RIP KEN!!
Still he will forever be missed. R.I.P Ken B
Thank you Ken
JUCAAAAAAAA💓💓💓
I m waiting for audi lego speed champion set
Amazing tallent and a mossed driver but the EV version just lacks the right sounds!  And this is from someone who will probably get an EV for their next car
This Made Me Sad ): Thank You For Everything Ken!
no dejan que termine de sanar esta herida
My world isnt the same without Mr Hoonigan🥺R.I.P Mr Hoonigan
The first gymkhana where I cried Still, you've done a great job, rest in peace Ken 😢❤️    #43ver
KEN BLOCK descansa en Paz, hermano KEN ya eres mexicano,  JUCA saliste como asustado bro
R.I.P. ken block you will be sorely missed😭

Thank you for this holiday surprise.

RIP Ken.
It's crazy to grow up watching this stuff, and then you blink and an era just came to an end.
R.I.P MR KEN BLOCK <3 <3 YOU ARE A KING
Fantastic video as always and RIP Ken Never Forgot
We miss Ken Block and we miss the five cylinder Quattro
I still can't believe Ken Block is gone. He passed away two weeks after my mom did her passing feels so much more recent but it feels like Ken has been gone longer and I don't know why. Grief and life are such a strange thing. I miss them both very much. ❤
ehhhh not fan of the lack of roaring engine
Fast!! And Wild!!!🤘🏽🤘🏽
What an honor to work with THE Legend.  #43ver
Wasn't expecting new KB content. His fun loving personality is sadly missed. He meant a lot to the community.
RIP legend. Thanks hoonigan team for another dope video!
never to be forgotten
Respect and R.I.P Ken  ❤❤❤
Leyenda ❤❤❤
"The man who did not know the impossible!" RIP LEGEND!!!!!!!
Lame. Rip to ken, he was the man. But electric is boring.
Warum E Autos hört sich an wie ein RC car 🤮
Huh......It's like watching Gymkhana 1 with the sound off and my Roomba cleaning the room.
Um homem e uma máquina juntos capazes de tudo. Obrigado Ken block por tudo que você fez para o mundo do automobilismo e principalmente a nós que temos a esperança e a vontade de ser pilotos um dia, nós levaremos esse legado de um HOONIGAN para sempre. ❤
RIP Ken and many thanks for your job, smile and passion brother...
❤❤❤ love from 🇸🇪
DRIVE in Peace, Ken!! 🕊️
i couldnt help but laugh at how goofy this thing sounds
Gracias por dejarnos esta huella en nuestro querido país. Legend🕊️🇲🇽👏🏽
La leyenda cuenta que en el AIFA no tuvieron que cerrar nada, así esta normalmente.
RIP to an absolute legend,  it was another awesome display of KB's skill.  So cool to see his daughter Lia do the recent Pikes Peak, she is so fearless and such an amazing driver,  definitely going to carry on her Dad's legacy of  Hoonigan'ism
and that concludes the final chapter of an incredible series
#KB43VER
Ciao hello to all 👍❤#kb43ver ❤
Franchement le bruit est insupportable on se croirait chez le dentiste, pilotage exceptionnel dans une molettes de dentiste ! Quel dommage
I'm not crying, you are!!😭
RIP Leyend, your driving will be a inspiration to millions 4 ever.
Big smile here. Albeit with a lump in the throat. Legend RIP
43ver❤
legends never dies🤩
R.I.P
Sound if tis car is so shitty :)
Watching this made me n the boys cry….damn… you’ll forever be a legend #KB43
An icon of car culture everywhere! Pretty unmatched in the 21st century id say.
dammit, i'm not gonna say that I didn't enjoy it cause that would be a lie, but how sad it makes me to see it knowing that he's no longer with us
He might be gone but the history and culture he left behind will live on forever
He was always pushing the limits, its so inspiring !!❤
Best Driver ever!❤😙😍
Part of me put off watching this. It’s hard to know the legend has moved on. Thank you hoonigan team for one last ride.
Thing sounds so bad. haha
RIP
Do what you love until you cant.
❤❤❤
RIP Ken
Круто!!! Как всегда! Фиеста лучшая!)))
AMASING IS BEUTIFUL JAJA #kb43ver WOW WOOW
gracias por todo ken ♥♥♥
Press F to pay respect
I swear someone was cutting onions the whole time I was watching this. This man was more than just an idol to me and many like me. God speed KB, GOD SPEED!
Thank you, Ken. You made the world a little brighter with all you gave us. #43forever
Ken we love u. R.I.P.
Love watching his performances but this missed the mark.  It was his least entertaining, least technical and well, sloppiest run as well.  Disappointed that it was his last one.  Rest well.
RIP one of my heroes.
The ending 🥹❤️❤️❤️
with gas - he had definetly more fun i see :)
LLK ❤❤❤❤
Bonito nuestro México 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
KB & BS the 🐐❤❤❤❤ KB43VER
The overall silence of the video is the best way to pay him respect.
Awesome video  folks  Keep em coming  ❤  Never forgotten ❤
Sorely missed. Never fogotten. Much love to you all. Thank you.
Electric shit...
WHAT A BEAST!!
RESPECT TO KEN and may he rest in peace! Though, when watching Hoonigans videos I always wonder: HOW MANY SETS OF TYRES DO THEY BURN THROUGH TO MAKE THESE STUNTS!!?!? it must be an insane number!
We salute you! Ken you was amazing for everyone. You changed the game! Dearly missed always and forever❤😢
Almost cried watching this.. didn't think I'd ever see another one with him.. hurts more knowing it's the last, but was worth the watch. Ken Block's driving was amazing.. we all are going to miss this, but must be happy we were here to see it. #KB43VER
❤
We sorely miss you 43. @Lia Block, can’t wait to someday see you behind the wheel in your own Gymkhana vids.
May dead Ken block no.??
ESTE BROTHER JUGÓ FORZA HORIZON EN LA VIDA REAL! QEPD
Oh Ken Block, miss him so much
Really is end of an era but what an era it was!! Rest in peace Ken a true hero and inspiration to so many! ❤️
Block por siempre  leyenda
RIP He was the best.
Amazing. RIP Legend!
gone too soon
Ken was most definitely a legend in life and now he will forever be immortal in our hearts ❤ Got a little teary-eyed during the outro seeing all the older footage but I'm sure Ken will hoon in heaven proper Gymkhana style
I miss him so much
Ken Block will never die!!!
A rare spectacle - curious fact: 0.01% of the worlds population control 99% of the wealth. Even less less will ever get to do what Ken did! On a serious note please don't let this cause you to believe electric cars are cool. One day if we let it they will be connected to the smart grid then driving just a little enthusiastically will see your insurance premiums rise as your car automatically sends data back to your insurer.
#KB43VER ❤
Tu nous manques Ken ❤🕊️
Now you are doing this in the sky, that's why we see the clouds! We will love you forever Ken ❤
Such an Icon and ahead of everything. Love everything Ken touched. RIP
What happened to the video he was getting ready to release?
The sound is sooo annoying
njirr baru skrol tiktok ken, buka yutub dikasih liat gini 😭😭
almost a year since he's gone already... 💔
RIP Legend!🤝
Ken was such an absolute legend and such a gift to the sport. He inspired millions of people across the globe and fueled kids dreams for years and will continue to do so. R.I.P Ken, thanks for everything you did for the community ❤️
Wow, I never saw him actually look scared like that
"Rimac inside" sticker❤ Watching this my hearth start ticking faster;-)
MISS him so much. Regularly pray for his family. So happy to see Lia carrying on the legacy!
are they shifting gears just for style or does the car really have a gearbox?
No one will ever do it quite like Ken!
una leyenda que se fue muy temprano, gracias ken por elegir mexico de nuevo para tu ultima proesa grandeeeeee
Question? Pourquoi les vitesses sont affichés à côté des km/h?  À quoi servent les palettes au volant si il n'y a pas de vitesses sur une voiture électrique???
I'll see you on the flip side. #KB43VER
Ken was an artist behind the wheel,he will be missed 😢
Gone but never forgoten, you've left a legacy that will live for decades if not centerys. Much love to the Block family, Rest in Peace to a legend and an icon 💜#KB43VER
<3 <3 <3
Que Viva Ken! Viva Mexico
Miss you ken
It's nice to see one last video from him Electrikhana TWO. Ken Block you will always remain in our hearts. rest in peace #KB43VER ❤❤❤❤
Ken was my hero, top driver and top bloke. Such a tragedy. You will be sadly missed my friend. Rest in peace Ken 😢.
The greatest driver of our lifetime. He may not be here physically anymore, but his impact on the motorsports industry will last 43ver.   Damn that was corny, but it still felt right.
how many battery charges took to make that film? xd
dang, man's literally went to Mexico to whip some shittys
Man i remember being in high school watching that first gymkhana, watching them all through college. Now I'm ten years into a fruitful career as close as i can get to hoon culture and always tuned in. Rest in peace, Ken. It's been a ride.
😢
rip 😔✊
Legends never die. RIP Ken <3
Damn, bright stars fading fast and all that stuff.  Hope you're rewriting the gofast laws in Vahalla just the same as you did here.
Ken Block is a Legend that wont be forgotten
Got me crying on my lunch break there will never be another Ken
I rarely comment on youtube vids, this was very sureal to see KB in a "new" video.
Ohhhhh, ahora entiendo... Se contruyó el AIFA únicamente para que lo usara Ken. Ahora entiendo por que después de este video, ya no sirvió para nada más. 😂 DEP KB.  🥺😩🙏
Mis 2 personas favoritas ken block y JUCA❤❤❤VUELA ALTO KEN BLOCK. JUCA te amo papi #jucaviapri
Damn, great ending guys. Sad, but awesome
Miren como Ken baila. #KB43VER
"I watched it with tears in my eyes. Thank you, Ken, because of you, today I'm a car enthusiast."
Christmas came early! RIP #43. #KB43VER

Cara, é difícil acreditar que o Ken Block se foi.. nunca será esquecido
🖤
RIP to a Legend !!!🙌
Man what a legend ❤
RIP GOAT
GOAT
The loss of Ken is the biggest loss in motorsports history... I would argue no other death in any sport rivals his loss...
Thank you 🙏
There's not enough like buttons for this
I appreciate how they show that no run is ever perfect and the car gets beat up quite a bit with parts of it being left behind.
Thank you Hoonigan especially Brian for keeping it going. This is the first time in quite a while I've been able to watch something with Ken that didn't make me tear up😢 This one really captured the fun we all looked forward to when a new gymkhana hit. Forever missed and loved KB43VER
thanks Ken
Respect 💪🏽
❤❤❤❤
Unforgettable
Ken really spent those last few years getting the most out of his life. Even if it's hard to say goodbye i'm thankful we got to see him have one last ride.  Rest in peace Ken Block.
grande jucaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I can’t believe this is the last Ken Block Gymkhana ever. These videos have been such a big part of my life as long as I can remember. RIP KB43, one of the best to ever get behind the wheel of a car
this was actually hard for me to watch, it was amazing but knowing its the last Ken project before he passed. R.I.P H.H.I.C - 43ver
#KB43VER
fucking legend. he would have been so proud of lea
This isn't a real car... 😡
God bless, you are missed more than you could ever know! Had chills and tears in my eyes the entire video.
KB43VER
Ken Block's el mejor de todos a veces me pregunto por qué dios siempre se lleva a los mejores tan rápido, pero solo nos queda agradecerle por todas las emociones que nos regalo al detrás del volante y puedo decir que haya en el cielo ha de estar haciendo lo que más amaba aquí en la tierra. Un saludo hasta el cielo para el mejor de todos desde El Salvador
I'm not crying you're crying
4:00 I've been to that museum. It's an awesome place with great works of art.
Legend!!!  But the clips during the credits really hit home the fact that cars with engines are much more engaging. The electric cars may be super fast, but they make you feel absolutely nothing.
Gracias por tantas alegrias , vuela alto ken. Se te extraña mucho
RIP KB43
Such a shame its electric..a good sound from a V8 there now would be much better
Grande Ken Block, always remember by his incredible drifts
i'm going to cry
Call me crazy but I felt like Ken Block was there watching down from heaven on this performance
I'm not crying, you're crying!
Great last gift from ken and Hoonigan. Truly a legend, never forgotten . Lived it to the max❤❤
No engine - no soul
раньше даже машины звучали как машины , а не как зависший дисковод .
Мы помним тебя, Кен!!!!!!
That moment with juca omg 😢
love it, absolutely miss the guy!
Ken just made me love electric cars,
Can we have a behind the scenes/making of series please? We need more Ken!
Thanks for the memories Ken ❤️ KB43VER
Thx guys, I’ll cherish these memories forever. KB43VER
RIP Legend ❤
Rip Ken. Rip Hoonigan.
What a legend, great send off hooning an! loved the mix of all the gymkhanas at the end, but  I’m sad that this will be the last unseen footage of Ken Block absolutely shredding
ah man, it always amazes me how we can feel so strongly and moved by someone we have never met, but what a last tribute to the great man. I'm sure his Daughter will carry on his Legacy and do great things too.
bro broke several thing in his way lol
Thank you for all these amazing years and videos. The best video was in 2010. My opinion.
#KB43VER but never ever electric shit
rip kb
Race in piece kb
None other like the legend and his team!  Thank you for all the cool and inspiring content you guys produced over the years! 😎💪  It is still unreal to think Ken is gone.
Very cool but I'll say the ICE videos are more impressive, maybe this one is too heavy to jump?
i cried a little, what a man
Realmente fue un honor coincidir en esta época en donde Ken brilló en su último circuito
Godspeed, homie!!   #KB4LIFE
This couldn't have been a better finale; pure, raw footage of the main man doing what he loved. Beautiful.
almost a year. crazy...
The man the myth the legend! That car sounds like a fuckin spaceship
We miss you Ken
Мой любимый гонщик, который никогда не выиграл гонок 😂
Такая легенда ушла , очень печально это, кто будет радовать теперь людей эффектными трюками, дрифтом и крутым вождением .
ni batallaron para grabar en el pinche aifa jajajaja siempre esta solo
😭 #kb43ver
Ken Block era chairo?????   verga se me cayo un idolo
Uno de los videos más emotivos, con Ken Block y un grande de México, como Juca, impresionante ❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Enought to make a grown men cry.. ffs! We will never forget you, you absolute LEGEND!!!!!! #KB43VER
RIP ken the race car guru may your memory live on forever
when did he get this
Loved this man
Did they rent the whole airport..??? Didnt see 1 person. Rip block
such a bittersweet video. I wish his family nothing but the best and I hope Ken is still out in the universe doing Gymkhana's somewhere. R.I.P. Ken Block
😭
You will be forever missed, Thank you for everything! R.I.P. ❤ #kb43ver
QUE HACE EL JUCA AQUÍ 😂😂😂😂😂
hermoso el ver como trascienden las cosas
Legend!
Sound is sad, this electric ruins video.
Very good!
I got chills when I saw the title. Well done scotto thanks for giving us all one more taste from the legend. Rip Ken.
Watched 1 min, closed. Rip Ken, never forget. But pls stop with this electric stuff. Back on twin turbo v8!
Boring...
Absolute legend! #kb43ever
I am having a hard time watching through the tears, just so bummed he is gone
There will be never another Ken block ever as I live ☝️only many may be the same but never will 🪦 Ken we all way remember you for ever ❤❤❤❤
Tiene sentido que hayan grabado en el AIFA, es el lugar más solitario de México, después de Tlaxaca, si existiera.

Borla Exhaust sponsoring an Electric car.   LOL  ;)
One last hoon 🤘
I'm not crying, you're crying.

Wish YouTube would let me give this 👍👍
Beautiful gift from beyond the grave. Thanks for giving us one last ride.❤
Thanks Ken for all the laughs, oh shits, and wows over the years.. rest up brotha Lia got the keys  KB43
There will never be another like Ken Block. So unique, incredibly gifted & hard working, the ultimate combination. Thank you Ken for always pushing the limits beyond what anyone thought was possible, & not only giving people more reasons to be passionate about motorsport, but gaining the attention of MILLIONS that otherwise would never have known that it existed. It’s certain that there are future champions & Legends to come that will have been initially inspired by something Ken did, and that’s pretty incredible! ❤️ #KB43VER
Thank you Ken, you will forever be my favorite racing driver. Thank you Hoonigan.
😢
This would make the school run interesting 🤣🤣🤣 r.i.p sir block of the hoon💪💪💪
#KB43VER
He really was an artist behind the wheel of a capable car 🚗  RIP!
Will be always missing my legend, rest in peace and thanks for everything! 🤟💚#kb43ver 🏎💨❤❤❤

One of the most talented and down to earth person I ever met 43ver
The ending could really bring a tear to your eye. RIP Ken
We wish if Ken Block was still alive.😢
Can’t wait to see the Gymkhana Files on this one!
Bro, your still with Us, just elevated.... #43ver #hoonhigh
Ken block is literally the reason I got into going sideways. Imagine if he were an fd driver. He could’ve very well done it and dominated! RIP TO A LEGEND THAT WILL LIVE IN OUR HEARTS AND BUILDS FOR EVER🙏🏾🕊️#LLKB43
The fact that those tires hold up to the abuse and still able to hit 200 with out them completely coming apart is amazing lol … rip brother
Thank you ken ❤️
Auch in Deutschland wirst du immer in unsere besten Erinnerung sein! Du warst einer der verrücktesten Autofahrer! Ruhe in Frieden Ken!!! 😢
Rest in peace king!! You showed all us to never stop doing what you love. One of, if not the best rally drivers of the newer generation. Your legacy will live on forever 🤘
I remember so many of these videos over the years & remember thinking “I can’t wait for the next one to drop in a couple of months!” You will be missed so much ❤ hoonigan forever 🤟🏾
♥ RIP
Thank you Ken <3 had alot of fun watching you since your first video! R.I.P legende <3
😢😢😢😢
Ken, I will never forget you. Thank you for showing me how to drive like a dream. Rest in peace.
Thank you Ken for an amazing childhood <3
For sureeee didn’t cry at the first 30 seconds
This was incredible. Thank you for all the years of inspiration. KB43ver!
I miss the sound so much... its like I was watching Gymkhana on mute :/
I'm not criying😢... Y siempre entre los grandes el Juca y su bochito 👌
No lie, even though i had tears watching this, it was happy tears! This was and is exactly how i will always remember KB43 4ever #LEGEND
That was great!
Thanks Ken, for giving us the gift of your life and your talent.   Thanks Hoonigan team for capturing it and sharing it with us.  We could all hope to leave this world with friends, family and a body of work like Ken has.  #KB43VER!
Chills and Goosebumps!!!
"Las leyendas nunca mueren"
thank u for everything u have succed RIP
Long Live the Legend
Miss you Ken💔
ken descansa en paz ❤
RIP, absolute legend.

I rarely openly weep about the death of a celebrity.  Ken's hit different. Really hard and fast. I am still in shock and still very sad. RIP KB43VR
What a dude.
Rest in Peace Ken Block
Love what you guys did with motorfest it’s what the game needed
☝🏻☝🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
TAMIYA
He will be missed! R.I.P.
Absolute sender, rip in paradise Ken
Miss ya Ken, and you inspire…but the sound from the car is obnoxious at best. the video falls so flat in the excitement with the lack of ice engine sounds.
Thanks to the one person who could prove EVs are cool
Se grabó en el aifa por qué nunca hay gente.
Viva el rey ken block.
4:20 acoording to him, he was going fast enough🥶🥶🥶🥶
Rest in peace brother Ken, your legacy lives in us. ❤
xD RC Cars are bigger today :D
Let Pastrana continue this series
He will be missed!
A legend an icon a master at his skill. He was someone we could all look up to and help inspire us. To do things to make ourselves and the world a better place. We will forever miss Ken but he will live on in the minds and hearts of all of us  He’s got four wheels for wings Go show them angels how it’s done  #KB4L
LEGEND ❤
gogogogogoooooo kennnnnn
I remembered when I saw him a on a modified cover magazine as a kid. I read the whole article and watched the gymkhana 2 YouTube video (8:32). That’s when I began watching YouTube, discovered his previous gymkhana video, found out what “rally” was, and later on started watching Hoonigan. I still have that magazine. Thanks KB43 and Hoonigan for all the amazing content you given us.
43ver❤
He genuinely introduced me to the world of motorsport, I didn't know anything about it until I played DiRT2, when I first saw the Gymkhana 3 video I was amazed, I discovered Gymkhana 1 and 2, and from there I spent a whole year waiting to see what it did, what could surpass the previous one, I loved this time of my life where I can say with tears in with my eyes that I knew what it was like to love an idol in my life, someone that I was about to meet but circumstances prevented it, someone that I genuinely wanted a photo and to feel that that part of my life was fulfilled. He is no longer here but he left an incredible legacy, a wife and daughter who have done the best, a future that looks promising for Lia, Ken will be proud of her knowing that he surpassed her, and that he left her the best driving school and a life lesson forever. Wherever you are, I thank you for having been part of my life, for having witnessed what you were capable of doing, for having taught me to fulfill a dream.   For all this, for everything you have left behind and for an incredible and wonderful story. Thanks Ken Block #KB43ver
Cool to see you guys in Mexico City 🎉
The Best forever!
KB43EVER
❤❤
Ken was the only person on the planet who could make me think an electric car could be cool
Real life Batman

I hope you keep tearing it up in HeavenKHANA until I can see it someday! Your daughter is making you proud! Hope you joined other great racing heroes!
I  had to pause it at 6:15 just to say Ken Block always have been and always will be a fukin beast!!! R.I.P Ken Block a.k.a The Goat
Amazing, can't wait for the next one!
Now let's all support Lia, there are signs that she could be the next big deal in motorsport history. Nothing would make him more proud

Ken Block was a true generational prodigy and an inspiration to many including me. Even at 55 years old he was able to wheel that thing like a bat outta hell #KB43VER

Rip king.

What was supposed to be the beginning of a new era turned out to be the end of an age. Rest in peace, Mr. Block. I hope you've found that perfect playground in the sky.
RIP
Number ONE
These two created some of the greatest images of an automobile driving at the limit that humanity will probably ever have. Etched into the core of the industry forever.  Thank you, and RIP.
Rest in peace big guy. Found DT to be one of my favourite YouTube shows.
Moving. I don’t know what to write, been looking at the screen for several minutes while the film rolls again. I’m gonna really, really miss that guy.

He was such a bad ass behind the wheel.  Ken block will firever be missed and loved
#KB43V3R
Aparece el buen JUCA !!
A pity. When I see so many tire tracks on the asphalt, I know that it has been tried many times. Everything cut together.
Hell yeah. Ken, you lived one hell of a life. You will be missed dearly. I'm glad you did the things you did 😊
washing machines not please
I wish KB and gas engines would’ve lived 43ver.
insanely awful sounds

No other man will leave tracks on the roads the same way this man did, R.I.P to a legend to a legend who's always in our hearts and memories

Legend forever missed❤❤❤
I love your breakdowns. Question: how are you getting that nice eye lighting while wearing a hat?
❤❤❤  😷 😂😢😅
8:15 "Copy so we can be done" 😭 That one line spoke volume we lost Ken and are Ending the Era of fire-breathing Combustion engines!
Sempre lembraremos de você, Ken Block!
😪
I'm not crying, you're crying
Rip Brother!
legends never die... ❤😔😪
I grew up watching KB Gymkhana with my friends, I also had his Ford on Dirt 3... He has been a big part of my teen years... He's up there watching us while drinking Monster... KB43FOREVER!
Can't imagine how hard it was to make this video. Thank you to the Hoonigan crew and to your family Mr Block.
When you put the engine on mute so you only hear the supercharger
❤❤❤❤
I just found out about this man today. Wish I found him sooner so I got to enjoy his legacy as it happened instead of catching up at the end. RIP
Rip Ken Block and god speed sir
KB43VER 😢
Absolute legend ❤ rest in peace
I'm more impressed by the camera crew

Miss this guy.
Best Video Ever Best Location Ever
Legend
Electrikhana🤮🤢🤮
хороший мужик был,мы выросли на его видео 👍
I miss that guy..
How that for a tribute for Ken Block. It a perfect video in memory of him hooning about like a mad man but a very humble personality. Surely nobody in the world can replace Ken Block as he is one of a kind.
You ever see a grown ass man cry at work during a construction project on break. It happened
Ken was the reason i got into cars. I even bought a focus after seeing him in one.
For some of us he was a hero, for other of us he was a leader, he inspire some of us, he done everything he wanted to do, a pure hearted human beeing, an outstanding athlete, born with unhuman talent..... for many of us he is the goat of drifting... for me his driftstyle and control was godlike!  My eyes were filled with tears, seeing you drift one last time... Your legacy is legendary! You will always beeing remembert, maybe your gone but not forgotten. Always in our heart, ride in paradise and rest in peace Ken!  43er KB43
miss u ken
#KB43VER love this guy🚗☁💚
My god that man could drive!

❤❤❤
Ken Block, we will never forget your incredible contributions to the world of motorsports and your passion for driving. You've inspired countless fans around the globe and your legacy will continue to live on. Thank you for the memories and the excitement you've brought to so many. You will be deeply missed."
Me miss you a love you ken you're an inspiration ❤️
L❤
Just seeing when it started made me lazy to listen to that blender and I didn't even finish seeing it as pathetic, a car purist runs in a Gasoline, but in this case he gets paid to ride an iPhone with wheels...
A derrapar en el cielo querido Kent block 🤧💫
RIP #KB43ver
The legend....
Love it! @KB43VER
RIP Ken. May the roads be ever bending in the aftertrack.
We need that car in forza horizon 5
Poco se habla de la aparición de juca con el vocho en el video 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
This put the biggest smile on my face... RIP Ken Block... You were the dirtiest in the game
Is he died or not or is this someone else
Matt n Kim ending gave me chills RIP Ken Thank you for all the years of automotive joy! Forever in hearts
Rip kenblock you will be greatly missed king of drifting
Race In Peace oldman
My resolution for 2023 was to meet my hero Ken Block, sadly I learned only a few hours later that that would not happen. Glad to see his smile one last time as he did the thing he loved most. He was my hero and still is.
GOAT.... THANK YOU, #KB43
Hasta siempre quiero Ken !
This took way too long to drop being real, many fans who have grieved would agree with me i think
I love how he completely abused the Audi. RIP!
Hoonigan NUNCA ERRA !!!
God, we're gonna miss you, Ken. I don't know of another driver who can carry the torch.
Props to Mexico City, for hosting. I've always heard it was beautiful there, so it was great to see it featured. The route was like an invitation to visit. Very impressive. It looks like a lot to be proud of.  I feel like Ken and Hoonigan were trying to be ambassadors of all sorts.
Rip legend 🕊️, I remember my mom giving me and my brother a pair of the ken block sun glasses back in the day and we used to believe that we could drive anything, one of the biggest influences and a inspiration #KB43VER
I can't believe this is the last gymkhana I'll see of this Goat stunt driver. RIP big fella, thanks for everything you did for motorsport
#KB43VER
R.I.P
Can't watch because straight i'm crying...Can't  stop it😢
Aparicion estelar de Juca

I hope you are still smiling up there, as we are when we are see you. Thank you.
What a total badazz he was!
🫵🎉Legendary!🫡👏👏
You tought me how to drive. Legends never die.❤
My toxic trait is thinking in could handle this car by any means.... Rest in peace Ken ❤
We will miss gymkhana,  and we will miss KEN BLOCK, rest in peace
come to I N D O N E S I A please
Sounds like a giant RC car! I wish electric cars were really like giant RC cars: motors, batteries, and everything else easily changeable and don't cost $$$$$$$.
RIP Ken - thanks for the Memories 🏁
He seemed like a great dude living a great life. Sad that it was cut short but he made the most of it.
rip
Bro ur update in the crew motorfest is dope. The playlist is nice, the reward is slick, and i really liked the hoonitron
That was f'ing sweet
Ken Block will always be in our hearts and i hope there will be another driver to keep the Hoonigan active thus continuing Ken's legacy
Ken block hoonigan❤ we miss you ken block#43
Кен блок покорил физику и гравитацию , красавчик, очень талантливый был человек 😊
Some say AUDI/WV's are boring.. well they made this happen. RIP Ken, you won't be forgotten
As much as I love Ken and Hoonigan and what they've done for the industry, the hoonitron has no soul...... video has no soul and its shame!
did bro respawn?
How bittersweet, but thank you Hoonigan. Dying sucks worse than anything. Wish you were still here Ken. 43ver.
man i squeezed my butt cheeks when he closed his eyes and nearly hit the curb, absolute madness❤‍🔥❤‍🔥 What a perfect run as well!
Todo brutal pero suena como mi lavadora en centrifugado ❤🔥
ngl im sad that last ride we get from this man is in an Electic Vehicle :(  But he still will be remembered as a driver who had huge inpact on motorposrt and drag more people to it that anyone ever did. Rest easy Legend
no gasoline or electricity was harmed during this film
We miss you legend ❤
this was good, wasnt the best one. but RIP KEN!
😭We Love You Ken!
Sir, this is a street, not a BBQ
R.I.P. the GOAT
Rest in peace Ken will never be forgotten and will always be the king of motorsport
Can we appreciate the subtle all wheel burnout/tug of war in the beginning? What the helll???  Fronts going in reverse, rears going forward!!?
Very Cool.  Thank you.   Keep a eye on Miss Lia.  After Pikes Peak and how well she did,, anything is possible.  The story is not over yet.    They are never really gone, unless you forget.  Thanks to the Hoonigans!!.   Perfect Christmas Gift.
Ken got me into cars and racing. He will be missed.   Long Live Block
This might have been the best possible early Christmas gift the car community could have ever received, thank you so much. It is unbelievable to think that this is our final goodbye to Ken and with that. Good Bye, Ken Block.
this guy was like a Evel Knievel of this era
Was it a one-take? Did he change his tire in the middle of the shoot? If it was a one-take, how did the tire stand?
🙏❤‍🩹
4:08 el buen JUCA
i know i am not the only one who teared up watching this, huge respects to ken's memories, and best wishes for kens family and team
KB43VER!
would have been great without all the marketing bullshit. just let the man drive. i see your advet audi.. i will shit can you till i die

@jucaviapri grande juca eres mi idolo  <3
We miss you Ken Block #KB43VER
I will miss you Ken he’s the one who get me started drifting and customizing cars❤🕊️ KB43ver #KB43VER
The legend. They better make a statue of him.
Thank you Ken Block.
Rest in power 43, we will miss you forever  ❤️‍🩹
Just the best to ever do it rip king
God that hits the feelings
Damn this really hit deep. It’s like the grand finale. Man I miss ken, but we all know he is up in heaven shredding every and all tires to the very last bit up there. KB43VER🖤
goosebumps😢
Watching the tribute at the end brought tears of joy to my eyes, I was really looking forward to seeing and meeting you one day. You will never be forgotten by any of us in the automotive community😔
R.I.P Legend you always be missed #KB43VER
you can tell he doesnt like those evs.. they seem way too precise for drifting.
Io sono nato nel 2008, anno della sua prima gymkhana, e ho iniziato a guardare i suoi video da quando avevo 2 anni, li ho visti tutti e lui è stato il mio punto di riferimento per una vita KB43VER
RIP ken
I tried to avoid this video to not burst in tears.  Well the ending definitely did it.  But that stuff before was classic Ken Block and unknown sets of tires ❤ RIP 🙏
I didn't know I'd be crying at 8am today. Ken Block was one of kind.   #KB43VER
The legend will never be forgotten!! ❤❤
keep on riding Legend above there too ...God must be Lucky
so boring without engine sound( just those peepeeepeeepeeeepeeee
This is the real forza mexico !!! Qepd....
Ken Block's 'Electrikhana TWO' is not just a video, it's a testament to a man who lived life full throttle. Watching him tame the Audi S1 Hoonitron through Mexico City's streets, we're reminded of what it means to be truly alive.   Ken, in your fearless grip on the wheel and your relentless pursuit of excellence, you showed us the heart of a warrior. You didn't just race tracks; you conquered them. Your legacy is as enduring as the roar of an engine, as timeless as the thrill of speed. Ride on, legend. #KB43VER 🏁💥
Had me all in my feels. Watching Ken drive is insane. When the music came in, I lost it. One of the Greatest ever. Just watch what he created grow.
odd watching this now
Всегда останешься лучшим👏🏻
🐐🐐🐐
The credits was the best part! Rip 43
He was a super hero in my eyes
A legend and I’m pretty sure his still doing the same with god him self as his cameraman 🙏🤘🏾
He’s dead. Move on now.
The last part of flashbacks almost had me in tears and laughter at the same time!! KB4EVER!!!!
Love the end montages
ECLECTRIC = SHIT
The man defined the phrase, drive it like you stole it
With love from PA.
Machs gut mein Freund, hast mir mit deinen Videos ne menge Freude bereitet 🥲
This would be such a great scene if it was a police chase scene for bank heist getaway car.
To make this video, I wonderning how many times they charge this car....😂😂
Still can't believe Ken is gone, taken way too soon, but thanks everyone who brought this last video to us!
REST IN PEACE, SPACE COWBOY
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
So boring, give me gasoline.
How long did this shoot took? I quess u had to charge the car after every scene.
It's like the radio controlled cars you recklessly drove as a kid, but now you get to sit in it
He doesn't seem nearly as comfortable in this car. Especially during the "first half" of the footage...looks tense, and it looks like he's doing a fair bit of sloppy driving - just barely holding it together. It's a shame we'll never get to see him get really in the zone with this car, but I'm sure he had fun, and it was still great to see him on his last run. Hope he's doing well wherever he wound up, and thank you all for putting this together.
🔥 absolute Legend!!! He will be missed 🔥
Thanks Hoonigan for getting this out. I can’t imagine how hard it was.
There's nothing I can really say that hasn't been said here already. He was a highly gifted, creative and overall awesome human being. There is a hole left in the community and big shoes to fill and I can't wait to see Lia fill that hole and those shoes like only her Dad could. Much love and respect to the entire Block family and team. 43 forever!
Thank you for sharing with us all, great to have Ken make us smile one more time :)
AMAZING 🤩 YOU WILL FOREVER BE MISSED 🙏🏽
Such greatness. He will be missed. Again. All these extreme sports icons gotta take note. As wild as this is. It's a controlled environment.  But how long do you keep this up. The final goal can't be to go out in a blaze of glory.
What a legend.  That montage at the end really mad eme miss him
Savage forever. Rest In Peace to the GOAT.
Brilliant drive, peace to Ken’s family, such a joy watching Lia and Kelly drive at Pike’s Peak in 2023, can’t wait for their next run!
was he shifting gears in some scenes?
Rip ken
The big races in this update are going terribly on ps4
There will never be another Ken Block. Ever. Maybe someone will match his skill, but his talent as a human is just unseen in today's world of celebrity. Truly a man that never lost touch with that 20-something he was making content with his buddies. A man of the people.
R.i.P Ken Block sick 2 see he is stilling trying 2 shifts when he dont need 2 but still does probs for the feeling 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Was that electric car which he was driving?
Freaking Legend 🤘#KB43VER
Ken you will forever be a legend. Thank you for doing what you did and entertaining and inspiring so many people. Though I never met you I feel like we are kindred spirits. Now you're racing through the clouds. RIP
You will still in my memory forever Mr. Block. Farewell❤❤
It may sound like an angry mouse but that car is pretty damn cool
Salute the this legend he really knew his way around this machines #long live ken 🎉
Thank you Ken ❤️ RIP homie
EL BOCHOOOOOOO ❤❤❤❤
Awesome drive. I would like to see, how tires looks after this show...
Thank you Ken
What an insult to Ken Block and the Hoonigan crew that their beautifully choreographed work had to be interrupted by ads for perfume and Autozone.
RIP to a true master of his craft, he went beyond driving, he created iconic, moving art.
🏆✨️
When she's home alone...
Ken was the kid we all dreamed to become!   Rest In Peace ✌️
Ken is a LEGEND!!!😍😍😍     what is horrible electric sound have this e-tron🤮
Is it a coincidence that No.43 sums up to 7 and so does 2023? Guess life really is a Numbers game.🤧
RIP LEGEND ✌🏻
❤ Miss you KEN!
I still cannot believe it. The world will never forget you. RIP Ken.
RIP
Thank you for everything. So long, Hero.
RIP Ken Block ♥♥♥
Best race action content ever made! 43♥
43ver!!!!!
i saw all of gymkhana incredible driver  ! Best driver !
KB43VER!
❤️❤️❤️❤️🥲🥲
I still miss this guy.
謝謝你 KEN為大家帶來精彩的甩尾
To hoonigan team and family and friends of 43 thank you for believing in him and supporting his life!
Kramnik has lost it, Dunning Kruger Effect in full force. Overestimates his own intelligence and clearly can't grasp simple mathematical concepts and the general realities...
he will be missed.  and.. also roar of petrol engines
THE BEST PART WAS WHEN JUCA APPEARED,  HOT WHEEL LEGENDS / TUNNING CARS/YOUTUBER..❤❤
R.I.P Ken <3
Died on a snowmobile what a dork
Покойся с миром
"yOu CaN cOoK A sTEak iN a MiCRowAVe" looks pretty good to me
RIP Mr DRIFT!😭😭
@hoonigan You need a handbrake system that when you pull it locks the rear tires and if you push it forward it locks the front tires, have it hooked into the ECU to engage or disengage the power for each axle when engaged, this would work great with electric engines and enable the car to do some seriously different maneuvers!
what a nice surprise ❤
R.I.P Ken you will be missed
RIP to a true legend
we miss you ken
God loved his drifting artwork here so much, he called him up to hoon for him for all time
He might be gone but he will never be forgotten. You are a legend. Thank you for everything, Ken. 43ver. <3  #KB43VER
Best of a generation , RIP❤ love the KB legacy
Sounds sucks
Fell in sleep, boring
Well done Scotto and team. Very nice tribute!
Rest in Peace, Ken Block
Thank you ken and everyone at Hoonigan for all these awesome years of hard and entertainment work for us! Rest in peace legend, you will always hold a place in our hearts! ❤ #kb43ver
this video had me smiling from ear to ear!!
WOW - THANK YOU KEN.
Almost a year that you leave us and your family😢
We miss you Ken Block We can do without electric cars Climate change is fake
Can anyone explain for me why the car has a gearbox?
Merci pour cette sorcière vidéo du GOAT Ken Block 🙏🙏🙏 il va manquer au monde ce grand homme 😢
Легенда! ❤ #kb43ver
Rip to one of the biggest inspirations in the car community, ken inspired millions to get into cars and just have fun hooning them around with friends. the community will forever have a hole without you. What a legend
Ken pioneered motorsports, changed it forever and inspired many,  you will be missed ❤❤  #KB43VER
This brings a happy tear to my eye. We all strive to be like Ken. Pure passion, day in, day out, for the thing you truly love. His skill, personality, and outreach will be more than missed. I never got the chance to meet him, but he accelerated my passion for cars and desire to help others. Thank you Ken. May he be with us in spirit until we ride again.🏎❤
DK 👑 KEN YOU HAVE DEFINITELY LEFT A GIANT HOLE IN MOTORSPORTS
🙌🔥
It is wonderful to see Ken Block again here on yt, I'm just sad he couldn't be here😢 Rest in peace🙏
Αν ήταν το αυτοκίνητο  με  βενζίνη αντί το ηλεκτρικό κουτί με μπαταρίες θα ήταν πολύ καλύτερο το βίντεο
Rest in peace LEGEND!
It's been a privilege to have these films in the world.

The car started screeching like a witch after the 6th minute of the video! That's crazy!
Thank you, Ken.
KB43VER!!! This was so sick, Ken’s been such an inspiration for the world nothing will be forgotten. Legends never die 🤘🏼🔥
Hmm. Nice seeing ken again. Not gonna lie, almost turned this off due to the sound of the electric car. Take the hoonicorn engine sound anyday of the week. Great video though. Rip Ken Block.
R.I.P Legend!
Да какой то испанский стыд а не ДЖИМХАНА. Электричка ни разу не Субару. Где рёв мотора до отсечки??? 😢 Где эмоции?? Где пульс под 200??? Где выброс адреналина???
true legend, but the last one is de baddest one... #legend #kb43
Dubbed sounds suck
Rest in Heaven my Friend! 💘
Thank you for everything. You were an inspiration for all of us. #KB43VER🖤💚

You are deeply loved & truly missed my friend.  P.S. this car must have been a handful & then some because i feel like ive never seen Ken make so many facial expressions while driving 😂  #KB43VER

Eco friendly pencil eraser tires. They clean concrete;)
Ken Block, you are greatly missed. Endless thanks go out to Hoonigan to giving us all these years of incredible footage of Ken doing what he loved. I hope you're up there still tearing it up buddy. We miss you down here. 🏎️💨
Thank you for all the emotions you gave me and others. Thank you for driving such cars with so much passion and for allowing us to be a part of it. It was an honor to be a fan. Rest in peace Mr Block❤❤❤❤
Race peacefully in paradise my biggest idol growing up. You will never be forgotten and I will for ever miss you.
Thankyou Hoonigan, for this, truly. What a gift at the end of a tough year. KB43ver!

Forever missed. Never forgotten. #KB43
❤‍🩹
RIP Ken ❤
вот проказник
Thank you Ken Block, you’ve inspired and entertained us all through the years! This is such a wonderful last gift for us all. The facial expressions, the close calls, everything! Still doesn’t feel real. Miss you Ken, may your legacy live on #KB43VR
I miss him :(
This made me genuinely emotional. The world will never see the likes of Ken ever again. The way he just makes it all look easy. The goat 43ver
Земля ему пухом
Creia que le video tenia un problema de audio......però es un jodido coche electrico  Gran video 👍🏻
Drift in peace, road king.
Electrikhana missed a v8 sounds or a music, sorry but it is boring :( Miss you ken !

#Kb43ver❤
cant believe this is the final Ken-khana video we will ever get. rest in peace legend, you left behind an amazing legacy and you will be remembered
JustStopOil protesters are still scratching their heads on this
R.I.P. big boy and thanks for all.
Hoonicorn > Hoonitron. I don't care how much power it has and how sick it looks when it sounds like a food processor.
🫡
no more electric cars.... thanx...
Legendary stuff, close markings too.
one last ride. May you continue making white smoke in heaven
He's shredding in a better place, now.
I'm not crying, your crying
I don't think I've every been so sad and happy at the same time.  Knowing that was the last Ken Block video we'll see is heart breaking.  Best wishes to the family.  Lia has some massive shoes to fill but I thinks she's got it sorted.  KB43VER
🤙🏻🤜🏻💪🏻
Какой же слабый уровень, наши Георгий ЧИвчан и Аркаша Царь едут намного круче и вы все об этом знаете ))) потому что всех ваших обсоков мы уже победили)
I want Ken Back! 😢
May you rest peacefully.
F.cking adverts...you or Youtube? Lack of respect whoever it is. KB43VER
Всё супер кроме машины. покойся с миром Кен.
I never knew about this been so stuck up in my own life almost forgetting the legendary kb. He knew the car community can still enjoy the all or nothing beauty of having fun whether you're blowing piston rings or battery packs.
I still wish it wasn't true! When the trailer dropped for this a few weeks back I genuinely got a couple seconds of strong, incredible emotion that it had all been one of those crazy bad dreams you don't realise you had but thought it was true. I was so relieved for those few moments until the KB43ver appeared and then it was like getting the air knocked out of me all over again!  Miss you Ken 43ver!! 💔💔💔💔💔
Thanks Ken Block!! Our hero forever!!!
Another work of art that is created by the person I admired the most and it is a shame that he is no longer among us. Thanks to the people of Hoonigan for making his last gymkhana their tribute, I will always have the respect he deserves just as much as I do. you really thank you very much❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Rip 43
Absolute GOAT, will truly miss these videos!
Need a tally please Cameras annihilated  Tyres destroyed .... Tears shed =(
Какой инопланетный звук движка
Wahnsinn,  REST iN PEACE Ken.
Lady Time 😢😢😢
RIP legend 43 Block.  I don`t like gymkhana without engine noises ...its like watching it without sound.
🖤🖤🖤
Still hard for me to a believe he isn’t here and these amazing videos wont be there anymore (with Ken) what a legend, nothing but love to the hoonigan boys for this video, you guys are awesome
THANK YOU FOR VIDEO  WE MISS YOU MR.BLOCK
Rip Ken. You will be missed. Truly an icon that greatly inspired the car world.  Unfortunaly this car made this video. the biggest snooze fest ever.
#KB43VER THX 4 EVERYTHING KEN AND ALL THE HOONIGAN TEAM ❤
❤
EV's suck
Ken..we will never forget you forever
What a surprise! I didn’t expect to watch another one. He was the best driver imo, only one other comes close. Don’t slow down!
I thought that twit died? How can he be making videos or am I missing something here? I thought he got cancer and junk?
I couldn't help but shed a tear while watching this, Ken is and always will be a legend. One who lived the life some of  us dream about, may your soul become one with the universe once again. We Love You Ken Block
I had to keep checking to see if I had the sound on... ;-) Sorry Mr. Block, RIP
that is some back to the future sounds!!!!
I will forever hoon responsibly , but I will forever HOON\
Rip legend
最上級の伝説👍
I miss you legend 😢❤

Amazing....😊
Thank you for everything, Ken 🧡🧡🧡 #KB43VER
So many of these shots have huge Icon potential, the camera hit, the smoky reverse entry on the overpass, the reflection of the Hoonitron in the window, so many more. I'll always appreciate your work, Ken, you've inspired my auto passion more than anyone else in the world. ❤️
Thank you for bringing that big smile to my face one more time! This time I cried simultaneously, but that´s ok.  Hoon in peace, legend! Thank you for everything!!
It's not Mexico City without a Volkswagen in shot. Forza Horizon 5 remembers. RIP to a legend, and I hope the legacy continues.
Best to ever do it 🙏🏻 never forgotten
<3 Ken you and your amazing driving skills will be missed. I cant wait to see your daughter do a gymkhana.
miss you ken
May God let his soul rest      :'(R.I.P)':
This is AI generated.

An absolute legend in the Motorsport world. Thank you for sharing your talent with the world.
It's a pity that Ken made his last films on this electric chaise. No sounds, no soul...  R.I.P Legend
This man could drive 🔥
Lo saló visitar el AIFA
43VER A LEGEND.
Unwatchable!  E cars suck!
He was a legend. Paved the way in motorsports for the modern way to do it, with awesome and engaging marketing for the masses. I know he probably had the best team to push him, but he had the talent, no doubt about it.
The Eternal King
Legend, It was a sad day when he passed. Rest In Paradises!!
Is that thing electric? You can block really die though? I'm still in disbelie!
Represent the '43' forever ...but this electric rubbish is not 'block'
Kenblock wasn't the best rally driver but he left a impactful legacy
RIP to the GOAT KB43VER
This is going to be difficult to watch knowing we just lost this Legend. #KB43VR
First time ever seeing him close his eyes like that!😂 and he cleared!
#43ver
Legend driver, in our hearts and minds forever!!
Thankyou for all these memories and to be one of the most iconic motorsport driver of all the time. #KB43ver
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, but lose his own soul. Or what would a man give, in exchange for his soul?
Rest in Peace, Ken. An artist and lover of his craft, so much so, no only did was he able to pass his skill and talent to his next generation, but to generations around the world and for your work, we are forever in awe and grateful to have witnessed the feats of Motorsport you’ve accomplished in your lifetime.  Hoon on, brother.
Rip Ken❤
miss you bro
Легендарное видео❤,всем русскоговорящим привет
I don't know why but it was so sad to watch, RIP legend Ken Block
Great driving as always. But without an internal combustion engine, it's like watching a silent movie. Hoonitron will never be the real deal.
❤️
i love it
Покойся с миром, Кен! Спасибо за все фантастические моменты твоей карьеры! ❤
Amazing send off guys, really touching to see this along with the snippets of his entire series
RIP my childhood idol 😢

Хороший был парень, RIP 🖤
Ken is inmortal ❤
При просмотре нарезки прошлых лет, понимаешь, что видео с электрической машиной очень унылы и этот противный свистящий звук — абсолютное фуфло… Спасибо Блоку за мастерство R.I.P.
As cool as KB and Gymkhana is…. But this Audi man….. I skipped after 5 minutes and enjoyed the credits more…..
The legend will be stay in our hearts❤❤ forever #KB43VER
Rest in peace legend ❤
I wish I was a driver like Ken Block. He really was a legend.

So sad still can't believe he has gone what a legend R.I.P ken ❤🙏🙏
RIP Legend. #KB43VER
It's so hard to watch this..
❤️
Wieviele Kameras wurden da geschrottet?
Juca appeared in the video😯
Tears didnt grab me until taking his gloves off. Thanks for everything Ken. Forever a hero. Forever Hoonigan.
#KB43VER
Блок лучший в своем деле, жаль что его больше нет. Лиа продолжит его движение❤
still cant believe hes gone such an inspiration
Its the car from Rocket League!!!! 😂
legends never die
I have waited to watch this video. Hearing Scotto say 'Alright Ken, ready ready' at the fifty second mark with the title card 'and what would be Ken's las gymkhana film' ... I actually can't bring myself. #KB43VER
I felt like I was in the dentist's chair. They evacuated the whole city because Ken was coming. 😂
Rest in Peace, Legend
So happy to go on one final ride with the greatest of all time till Lia gets more time behind the wheel to show up her old man and teach the world the true limits of driving
Rest in peace Block❤
So, thats it… still don‘t really understand that Ken is gone…
RIP to an absolute legend,  it was another awesome display of KB's skill.  So cool to see his daughter Lia do the recent Pikes Peak, she is so fearless and such an amazing driver,  definitely going to carry on her Dad's legacy of  Hoonigan'ism 😄
electric shit is kinda wierd, we can hear only wheels.
End of an ERA!!!!!!!!
Still can't belive he's gone 😭 you inspired a whole generation Ken #KB43VER
43VER!
This is how you can make the people to like electric cars. Brutal, futuristic design, insane whining sounds. They doesn't have to be boring commuters. Thx Audi. :)
We love ken block ❤️🩶 saw his best stunts at 19 im 23 now but still rip Ken block
Most definitely a GOAT in the Motorsports world!! You are always here  #KB43VER
This is gonna make me cry
Rest in peace King. We will miss you
Всегда будем помнить Легенду! Крутейший популяризатор авто- и экстримального спорта.❤
#KB43forever  We miss you Ken!
I gotta say, after seeing drift stuff for the first time in person last year, you seriously don't realise how much rubber is flying around when just watching it in a video.  I was COVERED in the stuff 😂😂
The last ride of a True King. I don't think anyone will ever hoon as hard or as fast as Ken.   #KB43VER
Man, that sound...  Just sucks balls.
🏁🏁🏁
Although this is Ken Block and all my respect to him, I just cant get over the lack of soul and sound of the hoonitron . The hoonicorn thanks to the combustion engine brought all the drama and excitement with it.
I honestly havent been this gutted by a strangers death since the croc hunter died when i heard the news i just wanted it to be a hoax so badly i really didnt want to believe it   RIP Ken block
👏👏👏👏 for Ken Block nunber one and for ever #43fever 🤟
Man it’s so sad Ken’s last gymkhanas were in an electric car
I remember every clip shown in the montage 😢 Ken block the legend RIP
KB 43VER
Es un verdadero honor para nosotros los mexicanos ver a este grande cerrar con broche de oro! Hasta pronto cabron!
RIP Ken ! We miss you legend..
keren
Omg that car is a weapon, his facial expressions say it all he is threading the needle on this one so many times! We miss you Ken, thanks for everything you did!
👍🍺
Спасибо команде и всем кто принимал участие в этом , светлой памяти Кен Блок со всех уголков планеты. Не важно сколько дней будет в твоей  жизни , важно сколько жизни будет в твоих днях.
RIP Ken.  One of my personal heroes.
Rest in peace, thanks for all those videos, inspiration and passion ❤
ken: lack of torque the honitronh: yes? Ken closing his teeth to endure the criminal's burning of tires
We miss you Ken, One in the world.
RIP
he showed us what rally driver can do on common roads
Legends never die!!!       It gets passed on.        To his daughter, Lia.
Ridiculous as always! Rest in peace buddy❤
He was my idol since I had memory, he inspired me as did on many people. I'll never forget you, when I saw the news that day I started to cry like he was part of my family, I can't believe he is not beetwen us anymore
Respect to the LEGEND!
This guy is like the Jimi Hendrix of cars
He’s just one of the people that you were happy to know was here. I’ll miss him forever ❤.
💔
EL NUMERO 1 LEJOS Me puso la piel de GALLINA !  Te vamos a RECORDAR SIEMPRE COMO EL Numero 1 ! Fuiste la  Inspiracionpara muchos que entraron en tu mismo mundo de locuras y cosas extremas !  KEN BLOCK Siempre con nosotros !
А почему это раньше не показывали!? ДВС дрочерство не позволяло!?
Never wanted this to end knowing it would be the last one we'd ever see. RIP Ken Block 😢😢😢❤
Legends never die ❤

KB sleep in peace!!!
🕊️🕊️🕊️
RIP Ken 🪦🕊
Even a year later, seeing videos of Ken still gives me goosebumps, and this one brings me some tears too.  Ken Block and the Gymkhana series was what got me hooked on Donut Media in the first place, and through the years watching you all grow together has been amazing. He will be missed greatly by a lot of people. Thank you so much Ken, for helping increase my love of cars, and brining a smile to my face with all your hooning.  KB43ver
rip ken block
i feel like something is missing. and its not some bad joke about ken (mad respect for him) . its the sound . it dosent feel the same without the sound of those engines
I'm not crying, it's just windscreen washer leak.
Beautiful. Thanks Ken.
Мое почтение и хвала!!! Ты зэ бэст оф зэ бэст!!!!
Gymkhana will never same as before without Ken..
Legends never die, hero’s live Forever! An icon we will forever be thankful for! <3
R i.p. ken block. It was nice to work on your cars
10 years ago I was working in the drifting industry. Whenever I'd tell people about my job, they would ask: Oh, like Ken Block right? It annoyed me at first, but then I realized how many people had become interested in motorsports after seeing Ken and videos. I almost cried watching this last one, but there's one even more touching segment I'd recommend: the end of the Gymkhana video shot in San Francisco, when Ken is on the boat and there are several shots of him from the heli/drone with some emotional music in the background. Thank you for everything you've done, and we can't wait to see what Lia and the team has in store for us.
Man what a legend. His skills are unmatched. Love his enthusiasm and the pure enjoyment he gets from this.  It inspires me
RIP LEGEND we will never forget you ❤
I can't wih this sound...
KB43VER. I cannot believe how much I miss this man who I never met. What an inspiration.
Yeah the high-pitched screeching of an electric engine just doesn't do it for me. Give me a gas motor every time.  rip ken, I remember watching the first gymkhana video and it was pure joy.
HOONIKING
I definitely miss ken and everything that the crew puts together.
cant belive he is gone, what a legend
Mi sueño era conocerlo, vuela alto 😢
отличный был мужик, земля пухом брат
RIP Ken Block
The only thing sadder than losing this legend is the fact his final drive was in an EV and not the fire breathing twin turbo V8 hoonicorn. RIP KB43
Very bittersweet.  43VER badass.  RIP to the best around.  #KB43VER
Electric sounds are satisfying in their own way :D Miss you Ken :)
If I could, I would like to thank Ken for being such an influential person in my love of cars.❤️❤️  #KB43VER
thats why #KB43VER
Absolute effing legend.  You will be missed by so many more people that you could have ever imagined.  #KB43VER
A beautiful tribute to an undeniable talet and figurehead of automotive lunacy.  Rest well.
RIP
We all miss you Ken. We lost one of the biggest car lovers and enthusiasts.  Today, everyone is watching and tears are running on us. Thanks all the team for this last production with him... Ken43 4ever
the video looks almost like a fake...
That man was Safe in his cage.
I will always remember ken for the precision driving and his iconic laugh! #kb43ver
Rest In Peace Ken Block, the world is worse off without you. You are missed.
Vivió siempre su ultimo día, gran conductor! un abrazo al cielo.
Miss u bro
Never forgot his legacy,the one and only Ken Block 43
KB43VER
Toujours aussi impressionnant ce garçon, même après sa disparition.  Quel dommage. Mais, allez savoir...quand on voit des nuages dans le ciel, c'est peut-être lui qui fait le con.....là-haut...😂
These have been the best videos ever since the first on way back in the day. I probably watched the first one when it came out a good 10 time the first day I seen it and another 50 time the following days and weeks after. 🙏🏻 thank you Ken Block for all you did. You’ll live on literally forever cause everyone of these videos has blown so many countless people’s minds.
How many times can I like this video?!?!?!?
I fucking hate snowmobiles
This man will be forever missed and forever loved, he's inspired millions and will probably keep inspiring, much love Ken Block
the last minutes of the video get me small tears in my eyes. Wonderful and thanks that you make this video possible @Hoonigan  KB43VER thanks for all the great memorys that you share with us you will always stay in our cars hearts Ken
Can we get this on gta 6
#43 Long Live Legend!
Mr Block doing things we could only dream of. ❤
🔥

This is fantastic. Legends never die. 🔥
#KB43VER
Хрень какая то, ни звука, ни зрелища
Amazing ❤❤❤ I’m gonna miss all these videos in the future
❤ Ken block 43ver a huge inspiration for motor sports... We all know you are still drifting and pulling crazy shenanigans in the race car heavans. RIP Mr. Ken Block ❤
I think we all shed a tear for the legend at the end of this video.... Fly high brodie you truly are my inspiration still!!
Как же это выглядит уныло и скучно.... Вечная память этому классному шоумену и продавцу кроссовок, но вот электрички хороши в повседневной жизни но ни как не в спорте!!!!
THe sound this car makes!!!!! Its the sound of what I think the Batmobile should sound like, quiet, yet terrifying!!!!!!
stupid garbage - a world full of idiots
rip big man
Biden can’t Gymkhana   RIP Ken 👑
loved the tribute at the end. RIP ken your one a million
The only two celebrity's I cried when they passed this great man and Steve Irwin 😢 you guys will be missed but never forgotten.
RiP 🪦 LEGENDE
Paying all my respect to the legend.It's so sad that Ken's very last ride isn't some roaring beast, but a wheezing electric wheelchair... It just doesn't feel complete...🥲
We miss you legend KB 43😢😢
#KB43VER ❤❤
You will be missed by many! <3
Ken block the best gymkhana driver ever! and tanner foust 2nd.
I miss you friend :(
I'm not crying,  😢I just got a ken block in my eyes
Miss Ken  wish 2023 Utah didn’t snow .
No puede ser México le Falto filtro amarillo
RIP legend, I hope you are well there
Wish this was in an ICE vehicle and NOT an overgrown RC car! Electric just doesn't give off the same feel at the limits when watching without the sound of an engine.
He lived exactly the way he dreamed.  Everyone has an expiry date. I'm sure he would not have changed a thing.  Otherwise, he would not have been a Legend.
The man the myth the legend!! He lived the dream. Much love to your family. Tears shed, you will be missed
My tears are dropping while writing this but this was  hands down one of the best ones ever created and captured thanks hoonigan and thanks ken you shall always be in our hearts🥹
real definition of sending it
Thank you legend....🙏🥺🙏🙏🙏🙏
You paved the way to a beautiful hobby for a whole new generation. Thank you 🤍
That exit out of the bagging station and 180 around that post was sik espeacially the hard left turn back under the terminal
Oh Ken 🥺🥺🥺 we miss you so much it’s unreal, the greatest rally driver to ever raise the bar and give people something to try and amount to😢😢😢😢 rest in peace Mr block you’ll forever be missed

Кен Блок Нам будет тебя не хватать! Спасибо тебе за все твои сторания !  Привет передаю из России, Москва 2023
RIP Ken Block. You will be missed.
RIP Ken🙏, I still remember that one episode of topgear with James may passenger, first time I got to see your skills 💪🏼
I will miss this forever. Thank you for this, there will never be anyone with his vision for these types of videos again. Shoutout Brian and Hoonigan as a whole for what everyone was able to create over the years. Most importantly shoutout to Ken. Rest in peace brother.
The Car and Snowboarding Community are missing this guy a lot.
Man if only electric cars sounded like this
imposible no llorar con este video
Missing you crabron ovd you forever
Incredible thank you for being in my country Mexico CDMX and for sharing with a friend for everyone like juca congratulations
When KB died. It was a shock to the whole Motorsports industry. He was known all around the world because of his crazy stunts and amazing personality. KB has touched the hearts of tons of people and inspired a ton of people as well. He has shown that if you put your mind to something. You can do just about anything. And have fun doing so. It is amazing that he was able to do one last Hoon before he passed. #RIPKB #KB43VER
Thank you #kb43ver
Nice to see Ken Block in action !!! But not that electric shit .
he's still alive for the legend !
Ken really came full circle with this one. From a Subaru on an airfield to the Hoonitron at an Airport. RIP you absolute LEGEND. I'm glad to see this fitting tribute to him doing what he did best.
He Hoon’d as hard as any man could. Never forgetting the 43
Had no idea he passed until four months after he actually did and was looking forward to another gymkhana. Im upset and annoyed
This was amazing and sad at the same time. Legend you will remain in our hearts 43ver, hope you are doing the same insane stuff where ever you are now✨
I cried at that last bit. Thanks guys for all you’ve done over the years. Ken was one of the greatest drivers ever. It still hurts to know he’s gone.
Even KB was worried about how close that one was @4:20    #KB43VER
oh this hits so different. 😢 but we need to see a build break down on this car!!
That thing Is every kids dream a giant rc car
R.I.P Ken Block  A true Icon.
Wow the machine we will never forget you thank again for everything😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Aquí todos los que vimos a Juca en su vochooo
Omg tearing up the whole time. One of the greatest drivers ever.  Still not sure how you guys are able to lock down cities like vegas and mexico city to be able to run this route.
rest easy legend!
I wish that Ken's legacy go on! And we get new Hooni cars and new khana compilations in the future!
Farewell ... hero of mine. You'll live in our hearts 43ver  #KB43VER
That thing Igr
En el AIFA ni siquiera tuvieron que pedir permiso, solo ya estaba 😂
God need ken to teaching angel's how to drift ❤️
NEXT TIME FORMULAKHANA
Thank you Ken,his family and everyone that makes these incredible moments. 🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁.
Rest in peace, Legend! 😢
Электричка вообще не то что надо для этого! Очень нехватает ратататата
KB43VER you are missed.
Rip Legend
I love that I got to watch Ken while I was growing up. RIP 43. You inspired to chase my passion.
The motorsport world was shattered when we lost you Ken. But none more than your loved ones.  Your legacy lives on through your daughter...and we are all here for her. Rest easy mate.  #KB43VER
RIP Ken.
You can manipulate but never duplicate
At the end, memories of the past flowed through my mind like a running lamp, and I felt sad that he was no longer with us. Thank you Ken Block, R.I.P.
I teared up a little halfway through. Knowing this will never happen. Rest in peace Ken. ❤
Legend, i love to see you again 😢💟
A quiet lonely road with the screaming of a single car. Just loved it.
Thanks, I needed that.  Miss ya
Bittersweet.
Surprised to see this video come up on my feed today. Ken left a strange impact on everyone, so humble yet so iconic, shook the motorsports world and it’s legitimately tough to watch his demeanor in new footage knowing he’s gone. Good send off Hoonigan. Off to play the new Motorfest update in your honor Ken 🫡  #KB43VER
rip
You are a legend Ken, you will forever be my favorite. My eyes fill with tears when I see you again, an honor to have had you in my country. 🇲🇽  Rest in peace, legend K43!
Thanks for one more r.i.p ken ❤
We miss you Ken! :(
Crazy how I've never got to meet ken but there's a huge void I feel in my life now with him gone, he was the best to ever doit and in my book always will be. #KB43VER #Legend
Как отвратительно шумит электродвигатель. Нет звука бензинового двс. Скучное будущее.
💚🖤
we will never forget you ❤
KAT
We miss you!
toujours a 110% un vrai
Bit emotional seeing ole mate behind the wheel once again. Hope there's plenty of horsepower wherever your chillin. 🇦🇺🍻
I wonder how many times they had to stop to recharge this thing!? RIP Ken.
made my night. thanks for the video!
That put a smile on my face. Thanks Ken and Hoon team ❤
Скучное видео без музыки, рёва мотора(((
Ken was a huge inspiration, a humble man whose skill and talent was truly next level. So much talent that it overflowed to his children. Lia your father would be so proud, saying this as a father of four. It’s awesome seeing your children flow your steps. You are killing it! #KB43VER
Legendary...
R.I.P
Rest in peace Ken.
A true legend, sorely missed.
KB43VER!!
One of the best! Too bad we lost him too soon! Regardless, the sound of electric will never surpass the soul of a screaming roaring gas engine!!
I miss  you 😢🫡
RIP
прощай... ЛЕГЕНДА!!!😭
I found Ken Block through playing a friends copy of Dirt 2 many years ago, and ever since I’ve been fascinated with his driving and rally driving in general. I want to say something inspirational like legends never die, or that he’s smiling down on us, or something, but nothing really seems right. Ken was one of a kind. A true master at his craft. A Titan amongst gods.
Rest in Peace Ken. But! Only when you take a break from raising havoc and Using  your new "Home" as huge Playground.
8:03 start the waterworks
The proper way to navigate a round about
Its always awesome to see a majestic beast in his natural habitat.. R.I.P legend 🥲🥲
Damn this was a great surprise from Ken and you guys it's crazy to think we won't see anymore of ken doing what he loved to do he was such a genius and a mad man behind the wheel of whatever keys you throw him that day the automotive community will forever miss Ken block KB434EVER
Wow❤
The greatest! Thank you Ken! #KB43VER
Simplemente majestuoso, por siempre 43
GOAT❤
el numero 1 por siempre y para siempre
That shot where they hit the camera was sick
Rest In Peace Ken. We will never forget you! ❤️❤️
The reverse!
OMgoodness the outro is epic!
Simplemente de otro mundo 43ver  ❤
KB43VER!  <3
Keep on hooning RIP #KB43VER
RIP legend 🙏 Still annoyed that the NSW police force would not let Ken do a gymkhana in Australia because apparently it promotes hoon driving 🙄 😒
Woooowwwwwww, parece que sigue presente ken @jucaviapri eres grande perrote sin duda un momento épico el Vocho!!!!!🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
You can tell it's in mexico by the sepia hue
*Audi S1 Hoonitron идеальна для того чтобы лихо погонять рано утром по улицам. Не доставляя при этом беспокойства  ещё спящим гражданам ))) Ken Block легенда, навсегда вписавший своё имя в историю !!!*
REST IN PARADISE KEN BLOCK 🕊️🙏🏼 THIS IS AMAZING! 🔥🔥🔥
the goat. #KB43VER
👍👍
Thank you Ken, u will never be forgotten❤️ R.I.P.
Any chance for a blu ray with every Ken-khana?
that 360 over the jump, niceee
the outro man 😢
This guy lived more than most people. This guy lived a life worth living.
I was good until I saw the original Subaru make an appearance as the montage started 😪😭😭
RIP,  KEN. Great driver.
Man I miss the Hoonicorn almost as much as I miss Ken. RIP to two amazing machines! ✌️
something about the silence from it being an EV and him being silent. it’s a different feeling this one. rip KB
Fuck man…. Just seeing him makes me just miss the freaking rock star…. KB4EVER…. Keep ripping up there 😇
sry but i have to write this in german: ich habe gänsehaut pur und sitze mit tränen in den augen da <3 ein auge grinst die ganze zeit beim video , das andere heult vor sich hin.. ich danke euch für dieses video! und natürlich auch alle anderen ;)
Lovely
May Ken Block live in each and every one of us. ❤💯🕊️
Yes 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Long live the legend! It's awesome that his daughter, Lia, keeps Ken' s legacy going, and her own development as a driver.

Rest in peace legend, you will always remain in my memory as well as in the memory of your fans.
never forget never topped r.i.p. Ken
He was amazing. So much control over the cars he drove, and all those crazy stunts he pulled off. Sad that his life ended on a snowmobile.
Gone too soon Ken was a legend and forever will be one❤
Beautiful ❤ kb43ver... Really miss seeing Ken and his amazing smile and energy....and ofc mad skills ❤
This was a therapy...😍
It's so profoundly sad - car pieces falling off are the metaphor I didn't want to see
R.I.P. #KB43VER
Cada que veo al cielo nublado pienso que es Ken quemando llanta y haciendo donas.
I'm not crying! You're crying!
8 years ago you and you along got me hooked on RR and Drifting. We lost a great driver and influencer to the game and life. Thank you for your love of the craft. You KB43er will live on in our hearts.
Sounds like soundtrack to the old movie batteries not included 😂 kb43ver ❤❤❤FOREVER MISSED!
🤘🤘🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🤘

Grande juca con el bocho jaja que en paz descanse en una nuve de humo Ken Block
Juca! 😂
🥹🖤🕯️
R.I.P.😢
It honestly just feels surreal watching this and knowing that he is no longer with us. A true legend in the car community taken far too soon. Good old “Kenny from the Block” will never be forgotten   #KB43VER
rip legend🥀🛻
I hope you guys have the behind the scenes for this episode. I want to know how many cameras were shattered, knocked down, ran over, and obliterated by that beasty electry beauty.  #KB43VER
@ 6:35, his smile and the way he regrips the steering wheel as if to say ," this thing is f-in awesome. Truly a legend that won't be forgotten.
Pure & simple Ken Block, miss you pal rip ❤️
Последний полёт несомненно великого человека❤ всегда в сердце😢

God, you definitely owe us an explanation on this one. Not angry with you but NEED TO KNOW WHY.... 😔💔
Que pedo con el cameo de #juca Te adoro Wei 💗 jajaja
Thank you Ken Block for existing in the world and sharing your visions, fun and inspiration to everyone. This is another example of how awesome you were and will continue to be. Enjoy your next adventure!
Thank you guys.  Ken was unique, he was a celebrity that felt like if he were our friend, although he didn't know we existed.  Salud 🥂 for his memory! Que viva Ken Block señores!
He just throws it around effortlessly.     INSANE.  🤯🤯🤯.      Rest Easy KB
La leyenda BLOCK! 👑

#KB43VER
Please help me understand how shift points on an electric car would work given how they aren’t really geared.
love you as always, i miss you and i will not forget you
KB43VR   Words just don’t work.
4:09 Juca is a legend. 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Yeah I'm half way through and fighting tears. Ken, you're flippin missed too much to be gone forever.
I just want to say that even though his life may have been cut short, he lived more than most people will in three life times.
The cars are beasts, the man a legend.
I literally cried with this video, miss u Ken, the best driver and father in the world <3
I remember when my dad showed me the hoonicorn gymkana as a kid and that sparked my love for everything he does and I can never forget that day truly inspirational #KB43VER
Ken  Block  forever.
gta no pilice mod
What i want to know is. How did them Tires last that hole video. Truly a master when it come to ripping Tires up.. RIP Ken.
Rip ken. you will be missed. KB43ver!
Great tribute at the end. Tears were definitely shed. #KB43VER
Легенда!
Man I remember seeing the first few gymkhanas when I was real little, one of the main reasons I love cars so much. This man was an inspiration to a whole generation, I don't think we'll ever see another driver like him. Fly high, 43.
Rip Ken. Awesome. ❤️
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING
Thank you Team Hoonigan. Thank you Ken Block. You've been an inspiration for everyone. Thank you Hoonigan for bringing just one more full send video of this late great hero. #KB43VER
I just saw god, right here in this video, we'll miss you Ken.
i didnt know ken. half of me is saying "this is weird, theyre parroting his corpse on youtube for views" the other half says "this is badass, im sad"
Thank you Ken, your legacy will live on for decades to come.
Thermal runaway left the chat.
This man is back from the dead? Was he buried in the pet semetary? Zombie? Robot with Ken's consciousness implanted? How is this possible????
te queremos ken, dejaste un legado en todos los amantes del automovilismo y hola Tito jucaaaa
да ну шляпа, кен блок ушел, как и мир настоящих машин... будем помнить!(
I'm happy that hoonigan is now in crew motorfest with their new playground.
Truly missed by so many of his extended family! #KB43VER
rip
LEGEND #KB43VER
#KB43VER 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Gracias por tanta inspiración, por tanta pasión por lo tuyo, KB43!
Hoonigan, I can't believe it has been 15 years, same age as me. My dad loved watching ken block show when the impossible didn't matter. I has dedicated my life to racing now and I want to thank you for being my inspiration and childhood..
RIP the legend
"If you're not scared, you're not going fast enough" -KB ❤
Seeing him drive just makes me smile.
The end of an era boys.  RIP Ken Block
GOD SPEED
Is this car 4x4 wheel drive
Just incredible🙌 perfect video of his last ride… you guys nailed it❤
One last go, and what a way to go indeed!  Thank you, Ken and the Hoonigan Crew.
Immensely thankful to have at least one more Ken Blockhana. While the electrikhanas are fun and impressive in their own right, forever cemented in my mind are those high HP 4x4 rally cars pinned to the red line and laying waste to tires. #KB43VER
😢👏🫡
Like si estás aquí por juca
Legends never die because they are never forgotten
Ver al Juca ahí 😂 toda una barbarie, epico Juca y el vídeo tss todo chingón  K43 😢
Un honor que su último video haya sido en mi Ciudad de México
I fell in love with rally before I could even drive because of McRae. After he died I kind of went numb to it all. Then a little over a year later I stumbled onto a Gymkhana video with Ken Block. I fell in love with rally all over again in a totally unexpected way. I drive what I drive because of rally racing, and these two guys were just the best, man. Just the BEST. This video was really incredible, and the clips at the end were just perfect. I finally feel like I can celebrate his life instead of just feel sad that he's gone. LONG LIVE RALLY - KEN BLOCK FOREVER #KB43VER
A highly controlled life sized rc car… rip Ken B! Love
People say he's dead but here he is ripping tires apart. What a hoax.
My hero, I miss you.  Thanks for inspiring me with your driving skills.  It will never be forgotten in this life.
Que viaje.. cuanta falta hace y hará ken en el mundo del automovilismo por siempre.. hermoso recuerdo y tributo. Y una mención muy especial al Jucs!! Respect!
1) the astonishing 360 out of drifting and back into drifting was jaw dropping  2) the whine and sheer sound of the car sounding like a plane😍😍 3) i wish he hadn’t left us all so soon😭😭😭 love ya ken!!! Keep shredding up there man
Big sad 😓
Thank you Ken!  #KB43VER
i dunno if its just the sound of the car or a filter used, but some of the scenes almost feel rendered XD i dunno. but ken will sure be missed. may he rest in peace :3
KB43EVER
JUCA 🇲🇽
Juucaaa
We lost one hell of a driver. Wow, here he is still making our jaws drop. Thank you for this final masterpiece Ken.
Thanks Ken Block
Damn Ken, gonna miss this. The anticipation on waiting on a drift  show…
It’s like he never left…what an incredible guy and driver
RIP Ken. You were one helluva a driver. A true legend of motorsports. #KB43VER 😢❤
❤❤❤❤ hermoso video 😢
Legend ❤
Legend doing legendary things. Rip Ken, smoking tires in heaven.

We miss you, Ken.What a legend we met!
#KB43VER
RIP big man
Legends never die #43VER
KINGS NEVER DIE. THE LEGEND LIVES ON!!!
RIP Ken   However  this was not really Mexico City. The first segment was shot in Santa Fe which is North East of the city. Then segment two was very briefly shot in Polanco. Then he went on the highway. Final shot at AIFA is 2 hours north 😂 of the city and airport where nobody comes and was recently opened. Anyway still amazing driving. Now we still have Travis Pastrana to do these crazy stunts.
I miss him.... absolute legend. Rest in peace Ken you struck so many hearts in such a positive way.
I want mustang Hoonicorn
The world is a lesser place without you brother rest in peace .  I hope you're doing donuts with all of the racing grates.
imagine running from the cops like this wow
Земля пухом😢
Man, I legitimately teared up for the closing sequence.
Só uma lenda como o Ken Block pra fazer 1 milhão de pessoas assistirem um carro elétrico fazendo manobras por 11 minutos. Que descanse em paz 🙏🏼 seu legado estará sempre vivo na cultura automotiva
You left us too soon, man. Can’t believe it’s been almost a year now. Godspeed 💚🕊
with out the noise its just not the same, no matter the stunts
rip off 📴📴📴📴📴
so glald yall did thisss!!
Rest easy Ken, my dad showing Gymkhana 3 as a kid forever changed me. Legends are forever.
I just want to say thank you Ken block and thank you Hoonigan. Because of you and your team my love for driving will continue on.
#KB43VER
KB, one of the greatest men to ever live, truly live, life to the fullest! Love you and miss you brother!
I hope that the new Lego set with that car comes out this spring has Ken as the driver
the ending got to my feelings
Thanks Ken Block for the years of entertainment and pushing the boundaries, you will be missed and remembered. Thanks also to the Hoonigan team for all of the work you guys put into setting up and releasing these insane productions, and for providing one final wild ride. #KB43VER
This is sick
Man it's heart breaking.
long live the king.
Legendary team Legendary diver Moment of the series? Besides the utter shock of the first film, hanging it out on pike’s peak in 2017 has to be right up there
Still can’t believe a snowmobile of all things is what got him. Drivers need to stay away from snow activities. Micheal and then ken, literally the two greatest modern drivers and the snow got ‘em
Not gonna lie, this was hard to watch but in a good way. Definitely was emotional for sure, definitely shed a tear, R.I.P Ken you have inspired so many as well as myself. #43VER Hope your are shredding up there and watching over all of us racers 🤙 rest east brotha.
We will always miss you.
One last ride. Thank you for being such an inspiration in my life. The videos you and your team have created and the positive attitude in your life have always made me strive to be better everyday. Thank you KB. #KB43ver
Donuts within donuts. 👍🏻
Thank you Ken for being my introduction to rally racing. RIP legend
Thank you for inspiring me Ken. I'll never forget you. 43ver

Once a hoonigan always a hoonigan  shred those tires up there Ken  ❤️❤️❤️
Uuumm...this guy died.....is this AI????
It’s so hard to understand how many times this super human saw the dead to the eyes. That hurts way more the way he left us. He will always be remembered as a legend 🫡 RIP

👍💪👏👏👏
❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯
My Indiana license plate for my Autocross Miata was HOONIGAN and the car was known as Hoon. RIP Ken and your kid is AWESOME at Baja!

Wow. A legend doing his art, rip ken. #KB43ver… man got me into cars like I am today.
Try not to cry challenge:  read the comments section
Really sucks we won’t get anymore of his epic driving 😢. Rip Ken….. on another note, I hate the sound of electric cars. Not a fan at all. But Ken makes it look fun
Ken was the prime example of what wanted to be in Life, even though I never met him in person he inspired me a lot in the way I changed and grew as a kid, I was in to his videos in 2013 and my love for seeing Ken doing all of this on camera grew even more, truly the biggest inspiration in my life, Ken, Your will be deeply missed #KB43VER
JUCAAAAAA
El AIFA solo para “variar”😂
When Ken gets in a car , he and the car become one. The skills that Ken possess just blows my mind. I know you're still shredding the streets of heaven. LONG LIVE KB THE DRIFT GOD, AND IF YOU DISAGREE,  COME SEE ME😡😁

He changed the game like Tony hawk did with skateboarding and bringing it to other platforms, so thanks Ken and everyone who was ever involved. Strange being human and how our stories are effected by other humans we may have never meet but still never ceases to amaze me what we can do for each other (Just to mention loved ken's face everytime he thought he was going to smash into something...the pain please no...car guys lol)
#KB43VER
The OG ford monster energy hat from so many years ago still hangs on the wall in my room,  every time I glance at it, it helps remind me of the impact you made on my life and my friends lives - With your loss comes the closing and end of an era that you helped breath so much life into and helped us all connect with. Thank you for all the inspiration and great memories KEN - lots of love <3
still curious how theres 12 million $ of value in that car
❤
Ken + Quattro = legendary!
Smiles and tears at the same time. Amazing. It may be time for a LiaKana series. 43ver
4:05 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It boggles my mind how much the Hoonitron sounds like an RC car.
the man the myth the legend RIp Ken Block well never be forgotten
Legendary psychopath turning this into a piece of artistic mayhem. He made it look so easy. Rip Ken block
Wouldve been way cooler if half the drifts werent practiced.
When I watched Gymkhana 6 ten years ago it was the first time I saw Ken drive, It blew my mind. He seemed like a great humble loving man. Thank you for this...
Rest In Love Ken ❤ Thank You
This had me emotional the whole time, then the end I lost it. It’s still sad knowing he’s no longer here. He is my inspiration, an always will be
Last one from Mr. Block. 😢
forever missed.. Rest In Peace.. thank you for everything you did
❤‍🩹
😢
Ufff que chingon video y Más si sale pinchi juca ❤❤
Всегда с нами 43
Legends never die . Fuckn legend dude
Todavia no puedo creer que ya no este Ken me pone muy triste ojala este en el paraiso viendonos ¡¡¡
RIP to the legend!
first of all fuck you for nearly tacking a year to make a video for this to finally release, i dont care that much about posting that much but you guys made me a car guy and this side lined me hard. you assholes should have used this as a remembrance when it happened
While I never meet Ken, I pray for his family when I see him on screen. He was an inspiration with his child like antics that always brought a smile to my face. He will be forever missed. May God bless his family and friends. May his legacy live on through Lia and his wife
El crossover Que no necitabamos ver este año el juca representando   🇲🇽 !
😟😟😔😔
Must be the tire smoke😥
Ken Block was always honest in his dedication and love for cars. The world needs more people like him!
"drifting ASMR" 😁
kb43ver
you will always be my favorite driver!  glad i had a chance to meet you, KB43EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Once again Scotto has shown us why he and Ken were one of the most amazing teams ever established. Wish I had met that legend. Thanks Hoonigan for giving us years of amazing content and entertainment. Kb4evr
An amazing one last hurrah for Ken Block epic video. He will be missed KB43EVR.
❤❤❤❤
Would be so much better in a Og Subaru. These electric cars are absolute trash to watch and listen to
Thank you Ken for everything you have done you have been the biggest inspiration in my life you will be 43ver missed ❤️
Literally couldn’t finish shit got real 🫡🥲
Legends never die
i loved ken since gym 1 and playing the dirt games and stuff and forza and to see the last gym he'll ever do be electric is kinda wack there will never be a day were an electric car will be cool imo even with ken driving it they got no soul i like flames pops and bangs not a constant wine and tire screech but thats me. I want to allways remember ken for taken hoonicorn v2 up pikes peek now thats cool and cant forget evo cornner just an epic shot but either way rip ken your still a legend in my book #kb43forever
Thanks for everything Ken!
An absolute driving Legend!! Miss you KEN!

RIP you psycho.
Thank you Ken Block I always share your YouTube videos and I will be sharing this one
<3
🔥🔥💥💥💥nice video i like it
You can tell it’s a proper Group B inspired car because even Ken Block is wincing trying to wrestle it in 😆
LEGEND
Too many people have left in 2023 you will be greatly missed❤💙🕊🇺🇸
Awesome! #KB43VER
Miss you much
The hair was standing up on my entire body while I was crying watching this. Holy Mother of God how I miss Ken Block. I would go against all Christianity and sell my soul to be in that Audi with him. You will never be duplicated. Was the best and the BEST you shall be.
We miss you Action King.😢  love from kerala ❤..
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
R.I.P. you maniac
KB43 What a Legend! Thanks for l3aving us this final episode. Incredible to look back on15 years of slides, burnouts and jumps. Sad to know that he is gone. Amazing to see the progression of skill, creativity and the fantastic cars he envisioned. Withthe montage it's hard to pick one. Pikes Peak is definitely at or near the top. Finishing off withdonots within donuts! Well done!
Thank you mr block for the gymkhana. I watched all gymkhana since the first ones
RIP King.
I think this is by far the most anxious/scared i have ever seen of Ken RIP 43ver.
What an awesome sendoff for Ken. He will never be forgotten. Literally the GOAT. Thank yall for dropping this even tho im an internal combustion guy 😅
FULL SEND TO THE END! we love and miss you Ken!
Thank you Hoonies and #KB43VER!
KB4EV3R❤
Truly an amazing and inspiring person!
El único lugar donde no fue necesario quitar a la gente fue en el AIFA porque siempre está vacío
Idk if it's just me but both of these electrichana(prolly killed the spelling) have had a feeling of CGI almost like some shots the car was fake lol love the videos none the less #kb43ver
#kb43ver best car guy on youtube may he rest in peace :(
#KB43VER
Always and forever my favorite driver
4:10 on is literally sickening! Even He didn't think he had it. Him behind the wheel of a car, was him walking on his own feet.   Also, that car has a punishment fetish because it loves taking a beating.
Gracias Ken ❤ descansa en paz 🇲🇽 thank you Ken for all the amazing things you showed us Rest in peace 🫡
KB43v3r ❤.
Without the internal combustion its just soulless and sounds like a cheap drill with a blunt bit tryna drill a hole in 10mm plate
A flipping snow mobile.........
Absolutely enjoyed everything that he did and the car he did it with a true legend RIP Ken you will be missed!!!
r.i.p.  Ken, it's a pity that you are no longer here.  :'(
Ken was a legend but without the sound its not anywhere near the experience of the combustion engine. The sound is 75% of the experience.
Is it me bugging out or did it look like a lot of CGI
Awesome video! The end really got me in the feels.
Ken Block una persona que sin duda dejo un gran vacío en la comunidad del drift 😢 DEP 43
Thanks Hoonigan for sharing this. We all know how hard this was to edit. We all needed this so bad. Thank you Ken we all miss you so much! #KB43ver
What video game is this?
You inspire a generation ❤   I can only say thank you for everything 🙏🏻 ❤
We miss you Ken ! #kb43ver 🕊️
💚#KB43VR
So much love for this. Forever missing Ken and his videos. #KB43VER
Love Ken,  hate electric vehicles. This was a let down.

Ken Block Was So Amazing I Wish I Got To Meet Him That Was A Great Video I Loved It
I'm too happy to see him running again!!!! he has influenced me so much. I will forever admire him!!🔥💪
This is it. The last of a brave hero. This is a historic moment in automotive history. Thank you for inspiring so many. A true legend RIP Ken #KB43VER
rest in peace leyend
It’s amazing, it’s beautiful, it’s soo high octane. I’m crying… God Speed, Ken. You’re loved and dearly missed. ❤
Just watching this is making me cry like there's no tomorrow. I really hope Lia can continue making videos like this to help keep Ken's legacy going!!!!!
When i first herd his voice my hero came back then got to to see magic on wheels #HOONIGAN lets got....
#KB43VER ❤
This video has me choking up while watching it. Another one gone far too soon. #KB43VER
💐 Flowers for the last one..
Felt like I was driving around the GTA airport for a bit
Primer video donde Ken se preocupo por golpear algun obstáculo.
Oh man... 😢
No me esperaba para nada a juca 😮 4:08
Long live Ken block 43ver
Dang got me tearing up. We miss you ken! #KB43ver
you will be missed for ever ken block, you will always be the goat #KB43VER💚💚💚💚
Miss you alot Bro. I think you've been reincarnated into your daughter.  She's the closest thing to you that will ever be!!! God Bless & PEACE OUT Brother!!!
入念なテストとリハーサルが伺えるタイヤ痕を見ても、彼が本当に徹底したエンターテイナーだと言う事が分かる。 本当に惜しい人を早くに亡くしてしまった。  また、もしもこの動画が上手い編集では無く一発撮りなのだとしたら、タイヤのパフォーマンスも驚愕するレベルだと思う。最後までグリップも操作性も一切落とさず維持できているというのが本当に信じられない。
Miss Ken every day. RIP legend
It’s crazy I grew up watching him. Hes what gave me drive to actually work on my cars and pursue my vision. His death hurt so much. Up there with Kobe, Paul walker and juice wrld    R.I.P to them all. They are greatly missed.
Very very cool!  Thank you! Ken was a legend.
Gracias ken block te extrañaremos siempre en nuestro ❤ idolo 😢 y 43ver
RIP Ken, you’ve inspired myself and so many others with how great you are, you truly will be missed! #KB43ver
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
NO MMMS JUKAAAAAAA
Race in Peace.   43ver
Absolute Legend. rip Ken we will see the tire marks at the pearly gates.   was there no monkey suit easter egg in this one?
❤
RIP, King.
When I seen this video appear i thought it was just a bad dream and he never died....but alas.....
Legend 🦁
#KB43VER thnx you hoonigan team for everything you do and thnx you to lia block for not giving up on racing and the team for helping her it make's me cry when i think about how she will grow up without her roll model i hope scotto and the boys will help her to become the new face of hoonigan R.i.p ken block GONE BUT NEVER FORGOTTEN
El mejor de todos los tiempos
this made me super happy and now im super sad
What a badass, RIP to a legend
Очень жаль, время смелых в прошлом................
Miss ya KEN! fully enjoyed watching ya all these years, hope u n GOD are having fun drifting everything.
Such a nice guy and a daredevil, I miss watching him ripping tires and doing incredible stunts. R.I.P. May God be with his soul.
Can't believe its been only a few months,feels like yesterday.  That ending montage was a great touch, right on the feels.
How many tires?
He was the best car driver ever and he will be missed greatly. R.I.P Ken Block
I love how this is truly silent but how powerful this car is
Can't wait for his daughter's first "Khana." You just know she's gonna continue the series in his name. RIP the king, Long Live the Queen. 🙏🏾
Thanks you for this!
Still producing hits like TuPac!
What a fucking legend. Fuck I’m crying
I bet if he knew it was his last ever, it would not have been in an electronic car
Thanks Hoonigan for getting this out. I can’t imagine how hard it was.  ❤
Ken is, not was, Just pure talent thru an insane amount of work and never backing down from whatever the next idea was.
RIP to a legend
Best there ever was 200% respect to Ken and everyone involved
#KB43VER So happy to have one more Gymkhana video to remember the legacy he left for everyone in the world. I cannot wait to hopefully see his daughter continue in his footsteps with her own legacy and Gymkhana.
Thank you Ken ❤ legends never die KB43ver. Rest in peace
Para mí unos de los mejores pilotos del mundo KB43 😇 nos dejó su legado y que perro juca! saliendo con el super vocho te la rifaste 👍
Chau Kent saludos al mas alla desde Argentina
Inspiring, Ken's spirit lives on, in these movies. Well done crew.
The car looks CGI
A new hoonigan video in the GTA six trailer! It’s been a good week! RIP Ken Block.
Are the wheels on the car spinning different directions in the first couple slow mo seconds?!
I love watching his reactions. He’s riding a line so fine he doesn’t even know if he can do it. He’s 200% committed, it was checkers or wreckers for Mr. Block.
It is sad to know that we will not see more of Ken's crazy maneuvers but at the same time it is exciting to see his last video with the team, a motorsports legend left but only from this world because he will live on in his videos and in our minds and hearts  #KB43VER
Ken Block`s 4ever 🛣🏎
Se le extraña mucho en Guanajuato un saludo hasta el cielo ken❤❤❤❤❤
[HOON43VER] In paradise
RIP to the drifting Legend Ken Block. You are deeply missed❤
The GOAT! God bless his legacy!
Maestro
Ken Block is a LEGEND and one of the best at what he did. I always waited anxiously for another Gymkhana or Hoonicorn drag race to come out. RIP to one of the greatest. I can't wait to see what his daughter brings to this sport in the future!
Tamiya can have this back give me the twin turbo's!!!
Man.. no one can replace you
You always gave it your all and inspired so many people in the process. Thank you all at Hoonigan for making it happen.
Good bye Ken😢 rest in peace❤
I'm going to be waiting for a **** ton more Gymkhana's in the afterlife. You know he's already started on the next installments up there, and they'll be epic.
These videos will be watched forever by future generations of young kids in awe of Ken. RIP Ken your legacy will live on.
Mexico looks nicer than the United States.  Also,  RIP Ken.
Don't let the Gymkharna series die, hope Lia can carry it on when she's ready. 🙏
You’re the man Ken.     But car sounds like shit !!!!!!
❤
R.I.P he was a memorable man to my childhood
Long live the king!!!!
легенда😍😍😍😍😍
Sick driving from the sickest driver out there. That end montage was some good stuff as well
RIP to the absolute legent.
Fuck dude. I will never forget the morning the news broke. I don't think I've ever been as big a fan of anyone as I was of Ken. #KB43VER
Mas de medio video grabado en el CHAIFA, porque la chingadera esa esta desierta.
Wherever you may be... You will ALWAYS! BE! THE! BEST!
Ken will live in our hearts forever  💚
This was a tough watch for me and im sure a lot of us, i still frequently think about Ken, he was my idol and i wish i could've met him. he has amazed us once again with his insane talent and it was great seeing him again. he's the reason i and so many others fell in love with drifting, stunts, and motorsports. there will never be someone as amazing as Ken, rest in peace you legend. KB43VER ❤❤❤
It would be cool if you continued the series with faceless drivers. It would create a secret club that would honor ken until you guys are ready to pass the torch to Lia hopefully.
You know, it always seems to Amaze me, when I watch Ken drive, but then….  I sit back & think, he was in his element & anyone that’s in tune with there element can just excel in whatever it is that they Love to do.  Then there’s what I call, God given talent & that’s what Ken has & that’s the reason that I personally think he’s the best in this kind of driver’s seat there has ever been!  I pray many Blessings over his Family & the Business that he & his family & his friends started!
👏 Very Beautiful 👏
The world lost a true legendary driver. He was the true patriarch of the driving world. Gone but never forgotten. Till we meet again my friend RIP
Great to see Ken in his glory one last time, awesome job to Brian & the rest of the Hoonigan team. Really want to see a full film feature documentary based on Ken's life and the behind the scenes of the man we all wanted so badly to be like. From all the tire shredders and hoons from around the globe, thanks Ken for all you've inspired in us.
didn't want this one to end
By far the most talented person the world gifted us, its a tragedy to have lost him, ill always dream of having such talant skill and swag like he did. 43forever
I had the same feeling as i had while watching Colin McRae's Biffy Clyro - Mountains farewell video... But this time i don't have any tears. We will miss you, 43.
Absolute legend! Thank you for all the amazing content over the years! You are and will be missed! R. I. P. 43! #kb43ver
I forgot this was in the works when he passed. Right in the feels. What a wonderful man ❤️ miss you Ken
43VER <3
There’s something about the silence of the Hoonitron and overall video production that really honors KB tastefully. Keep Hooning guys, Ken may be gone but the future is bright. Rest In Peace KB43.
Gracias, Ken Block ❤
a great tribute to Ken, he will be greatly missed but will live forever. I am Mexican and it makes me sad that they filmed at the “new” AIFA airport, surely no one mentioned to Ken's staff the entire political context of that place, but I know that is not the point of this video. #KB43see! 🤟🏼🤟🏼
What a fuckin legend always and forever. (Please put the S1 Hoonitron in Froza)
Fortunate to see the legend ride one more time. I promise to hoon my wife’s new SQ8 e-tron in your honor! Responsibly.
❤❤❤ el mejor del mundo 🌎... Y grande el juca
Dude.
Well, that was incredibly bittersweet. 🥺
A real honour to have you one last time here in Mexico.  You'll live always in our mechanic hearts my friend Ken <3 !!
Legendary! Truly like no other!  #KB43VER ❤
Man this was so hard to watch
Silent movie.
RIP KEN 🫶🏻 I just really wanna know how they shut down a whole airport and highways in MEXICO CITY!?!
😪😭
15 years of legendary videos..
Hot
Train the girl. She is the chosen one
R.I.P Ken
the best!!!
An absolute Legend, Rest In Peace Ken Block
this was hard to see smh SLEEP IN PEACE KEN ❤❤❤❤still not real to me smh
Que crack. Es un master.
Yes hi. I need an insurance policy we're going drifting in the airport. I'm sorry we can't help you.  This is AUDI. Oh sure  no problem 😂
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🥹
Race in Paradise Ken Block! KB43EVER!
Never Fails to inpress!!! Rip Ken Block. Will miss seeing these Thank you for the Memories.
Still not the same without that exhaust and induction sound.
Chalesota
Wooow, quien maneja esa bestia?🔥
I can’t do this…
Amazing driving as usual.  You are missed Ken by all of us.  We all miss the Ken Block smile and smart remarks.
Idk how to feel about this😢.....I feel sick again like how I heard the news💔
I miss Ken
thank you Ken KB43VER 🕊
43ver legends
KB43VER
The way Ken Braced For impact around that corner by the VW bug. And just continued to send it will forever be one of the The reasons he is a legend Tragically lost, but never forgotten.
🥲🫡👏
Gracias infinitas #KB43VER nos diste todo lo mejor que pudiste y es un honor haberte conocido haces mucho falta en este mundo
#KB43VER ❤❤❤R.I.P. Legend
I didn't know much about Ken Block until his passing almost a year ago but watching this gave me chills. No wonder why everyone loved the guy. KB43VER.
This was a great video, he still lives on in our hearts and memories, miss him greatly.
I'll always credit Ken as the main reason I got into cars. Rest in Peace #43, we miss you
#KB43ver!!!!!!
It has been an absolutely honor to watch KB do what he did over the years and change so much about racing and what a car can do. Thank you.  For the record: stupid snowmobiles.
Legend has it the rims on the Hoonitron were made out of the same material as Kens balls   RIP Ken, I waited to see this since it was announced but it took me all day to actually watch it knowing it was the last one. Before Ken left us he showed us that electric cars can be absolutely mind blowing (in the right hands) and we don't need to be afraid of the new era... maybe just those damn touch-screens ;)
He’s still alive he’s just wanted to live his rest of his life without being famous so he can actually live it with anyone always trying to be around him
Gonna miss you Ken <3 Keep shreddin tires for us up there :)
Paved the way and inspired many including myself - and will continue doing so 43VER
Thats where the tire marks at the new Mexico city airport came from it all makes sense now😂
The Man, the Master! to be Never Forgotten
Thank you Ken. Thank you Hoonigan for putting this out. #KB43VER
that car looks like an absolute handful, making me tear up watchin this man
43
Hoonigan - NEVER forget where you came from and those that built you from ground zero
It's just not the same without the roar of a real engine.
Damn… right in the feels. The world misses KB.
HOON in Peace Ken. For every cloud gathering, its you AWD drifting in the Sky. RIP KB43VER!!
We love you Ken KB43VER!
Damn it still hurts dude . Just isn’t right.
@mkbhd Don't think I've seen any EV do this before
I still can't or don't want to believe he is gone. Damn it man. One of the most skilled drivers ever, at least we have a ton of videos that will live on #KB43VER
Thank you for sharing this. Thank you for the memories. Thank you Ken Block, forever in our ❤
I’m saving this for a day when I’m bummed out. KB!
Rip to the legend #KB43VER
What are the odds they actually used those boat anchors called Rotiform?
Just watching the stuff block has done it's still mind-blowing🤯 😀👍🏻👍🏻🔥🔥🔥
This is what we needed!
Thank you Ken for amazing impact on the car community and the world you inspired millions and will continue to do so, you will forever be legendary! #KillAllTires R.I.P Ken Block!❤ #KB43VER
Viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Always a thrill, forever the enemy of all tires. 🤘🏾🖤💛💚🤍 #KB43VER
@jucaviapri. Un orgullo verte participar en tan importante y nostálgico video. Son unas leyendas 🏎❤️‍🔥
I hate to say it… but that was kinda boring jus the fact that there’s no engine sound
Honestly that was so boring
He left us with one final send. Absolute legend. Arguably the most Ain't Care of them all. #KB43VER. Would be awesome to see Lia continue the Gymkhana series.
RIP Ken Block. You made my days in high school a bit brighter when you posted videos when i got out of school.
You must be missing him Brian.      fwiw , I think the electric cars need an "exhaust" sound added to the straight cut gears.
R.i.p Ken your legacy will forever live on in these videos and in our hearts. You’d be proud of Lia for what she’s accomplished
Often imitated never duplicated! Thanks to everyone who worked on these projects over the years and gave them to us for free. RIP Ken
lost him way too soon.. KB did it like no other
Very cool! The shots were so beautiful too. Mexico helped, but the big, wide, slow motion shots were awesome. Nice job! Miss you Ken. A lot. ❤
siempre vivirá en nuestros corazones!!!KB43VER
a driver with that kind of driving skill is totally the masterpiece.im so sorry that the world lost a racer like that.rip 4 ever kb43
RIP Ken, but on the other hand, how much did it cost to close Mexico's city streets like that wow.
Ese juca es una vergaaaaa
Ken, truly is a legend an ungodly wheelman and genuine great guy I miss him as do many others may you rip 43 all of these files are true artwork 🙏🏻
I wonder if ken block can drift a snowmobile?
Rest in peace Ken! Thank you for inspiring millions of us to push past any walls, in the pathway we call life. The torch will never go out just passed to a new hand 🙏🏻❤️
#KB43ver
I miss Ken.  😢
Honestly kinda hard to watch knowing hes leaving tire marks wherever he is now. Stay fly 43
RIP 🐐
The credits..🥲
gracias ken, por todo lo que nos diste, estarás siempre aquí ❤
That was by far the best montage I have ever seen KB43VER
That was awesome! And sad....
a legend at his craft. brought a tear to my eye. the final ride. rest well ken. you gave us lots to remember you by
I hope they have an endless supply of tires in the afterlife.   Thank you for the memories Ken.
KB was a true master of his art and just watching this brought so much joy. #BK43ver
Hoon high in heaven 43ver. Long live the Man The Mythical The King The Racecar Driving God The Legend Ken Block
43EVER
what a legend. So... When is LiaKhana begin?
4:20 nah, closes his eyes and hopes for the best. What a legend.
RIP THE REAL ONE #KB43VER
i miss the gas engine blast sound, but good to know electric can do well too. miss Ken and always legend
IM SO GLAD THEY DECIDED TO RELEASE THIS AFTER HE PASSED AWAY. I HOPE Lia BLOCK CONTINUES THE GYMKHANA SERIES. SHE DID PIKES PEAK IN HOONIPIG AND IS STILL DOING RALLY. IT WOULD BE RAD TO SEE HER IN THE ETRON
For me it's an honor that the last Gymkhana has made in CDMX mi City!!! That places are now iconic to me! You will be always missed Ken. #43VER
R.I.P. Ken(
KB43 forever the 🐐 of motorsports such a bittersweet piece of history to  watch. Will be remembered indefinitely much love to the Block and Hoonigan family ❤️‍🔥
Absolute Legend. KB43ver
Que orgullo verte @jucaviapri, junto a un idolo de muchos 🫂
Keanu Reeves said it best when he was asked what happens when we die:  "I know that the ones who love us will miss us."  Love to all.
Legend! No one will ever do it better!
Miss this dude man ....He never gave off the vibe like he was to big for the culture
Shred On Buddy! Hoonin’ forever!
Legendary Rest In Paradise K.B
Thank you for one last banger ken.
its really hard to watch this through tears, he's barely left the stadium and cant see a damn thing
The King Hoonigan!
Sale el jucs!!! ❤
So awesome legend definitely missed #KB43VER ❤❤❤❤
I don’t understand how someone can have such perfect car control
Thank you Ken. 43ver
Какой классный был мужик, Кен Блок, покойся с миром
❤
Awesome. Only tires were harmed in there making of this video
Poor Kent (RIP) he was reduced to drive electrik Bull-Shit...
Who else muted the tv to stop hearing the ANNOYING whine of the motors.
Ken will always live on
Still unbelievable, 43 R.I.P
I have never seen a car's tires spin in the opposite direction before! 0:00
love
Thank you ken for the unwavering inspiration. I speak for everyone when I say “The world still misses you”.
El tío juca ❤❤ felicidades campeón 🎉🎉
Rest in power, Ken #KB43VER
Thank you Ken. You are truly the best. KB43VER!
This was kinda boring
This is the motor sport world equivalent of the Beatles Now and Then. The last ever track. The very final encore. Drive on, Ken Block.
Thats the first time I've watched one of these with tears in my eyes. Thank you so much Ken Block. You are missed sir.
This isn't real. Wake up. Wake up.
Damn.  Miss that guy.  KB43VER
That Audi totally changed the game. Ken, RIP, you are the greatest to do it all.
I about fell asleep. That was boring...
As much as I respect KB's driving skills, this shit was boring af simply due to the lack of engine noise.
The greatest driver that ever lived I miss seeing this guy drive it un real
#KB43VER
Just amazing!
Love that there was no music in the main sequence; Just Ken, the car, and the environment.
This is how I envisioned every Transformer movie should be like.
Ken is the king hands down…. RIP to the greatest that’s ever done it….   Combustion still the king FYI!!! This giant RC can’t deliver the same experience… that old ford would’ve killed this and made your wife wet 😂
RIP Ken, and here's to Lia and whatever she does in the future. It's cool to watch her and everyone Ken inspired at least carry the torch. #KB43VER
Love the look on Kens face as he was drifting backwards as he passed the Beetle thinking he was gonna smash the rear.  But he pulled it off as always!  Very emotional to watch knowing that this was the last time we will see him hoon.  RIP Mr. Block.
RIP KB!!
No matter how sad it is to watch this I can't help but feel better knowing how many people he inspired to pursue racing and their own dreams
I always loved ken but now i just miss him
damn this one hit different...
Best EVER!  The G.O.A.T.
🥺ken
i really miss that guy
Truly a once in a generation bloke, his loss is a real blow to the Motorsport community as a whole ♥
Goodbye Legend.
I miss his play and skill to drift 😔😔😔
Sorry.. battle scene
Sounds like a bottle scene from the Chris Pine Star Trek series.... amazing   Yet so, sad we lost such an icon!
I sit here in silence, slowly accepting that this is the last one.  There is a small part of me that wishes it was never released, just to preserve the memory a bit.  But I know that's not what Ken stood for.  He would want it out to all of us so that we could be there with him during it.  These videos defined all of us in some way or another and this is a fitting conclusion to that.  Ken's legacy will forever live on through these videos and he will always be an inspiration to all of us.  Rest in Peace Ken, always and 43ver.
The legend. Rip man, you changed my life especially when you went ford and I remember the mustang. Such a legend living and in the afterlife.
#Kenkahna
Thank you Ken and everyone at Hoonigan for all the inspiration! Rest in peace legend. ❤ #kb43ver
Still unbelievable... #KB43VER , great Video !
Never again will there be another one lke Ken Block watching this with such sadness😭😭 death will take us one by one
I love Ken block and have looked up to him since gymkhana 1 and was very sad when he passed. But the electric car khana deal is nothing compared to hearing the hoonicorn screaming high rpm drifts.. jetsons noises and motorsports is boring
Saudoso e eterno Ken Block, jamais será esquecido.
Fuggin awesome!!! Tears the whole way through. Then got worse when Ken said,      " So we can be done" Then the lyrics....don't slow down. Fuggin awesome!!!!!!
Ken kicked ass right until the end.
Love it!! He is drifting across somewhere in heaven with endless tires 😍 he also with all his family members that have passed on having a forever reunion
Wasnt expecting this, thx for this last gymkhana Ken, we all miss u. <3
Miss you ever day mate to watch this lifted my day since you past the only other thing that carries the same feeling in me is when I see Lia carry on in your memory she's just like dad I'm sure your proud 43ver
Kb proving posthumously  why he's the best.  What a journey it was. Imagine almost crying at a cool car video.  Thanks hoonigan.
RIP Ken Block
RIP KB4EVER A INSPIRATION
An astonishing skill set that will be forever remembered. Ken Block, you're a legend. We miss you!
#KB43VER
It's so crazy how an impact this man was a true gift to all of us who love motorsports, what a true legend 🙌  just hope hoonigan doesn't get to corperate as we can tell with this vs that and members leaving the brand. I look at Ken's legacy amd I wouldn't do one thing differently if I was in his shoes. Ken wore a size 10000 shoe because they can never be filled. There is always going to be an empty spot in the world of motorsports. Forever 43
Got HOONIGAN stickers stuck to my door forever RIP Ken Block a rally legend
I have a RC car that sounds exactly like that! I guess we're done with knowledgeable mechanics building inspiring vehicles. "just throw a battery in it" they'll say.
KB43VER
terrible driving
I'm not crying, you're crying. So wholesome and amazing to see. From the outside looking in, he seemed so positive and happy all of the time. He absolutely lived life to the fullest! 🙏🏻❤ RIP KN43VER
YOU WERE PART OF AN ERA THAT WILL FOREVER CHANGE THE HISTORY OF CARS AND ELITE STUNT DRIVING FOR ETERNITY.. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER BLOCK FOR AS LONG AS WE WHO LOVE YOU WILL LIVE. YOUR DAUGHTER WILL MAKE YOU PROUD AND KEEP THE LEGACY GOING BUT YOU ARE MISSED. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, #KB43VER
REST IN PARADISE! THANKS FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE YEARS!
Not gonna lie that sound is music.   I bet Ken would be Chuffed as heck to hear about Lia's progress in the racing industry. That kid is going places... at warp speed.
I cant believe this is the last one. This shit has my emotions all fucked up. Ive  idolized Ken and what hes done since i was a teenager... This legend will never be forgotten. #KB43VER
That outro....ooof. Right in the feelz. Thanks for all the memories. Continued prayers for the Block family and MAJOR congrats to ALL the Hoonigan team!!!
Ken erava el mero guero.
I clicked the video....but I cant help but be filled with sadness watching Ken do the stuff we all love to watch him do.
Thank you Hoonigan for giving us one last spin with the GOAT
This man is a hero to many people, sad to see the last one. He'll live on in our memories forever. #KB43VER
It's amazing! Rip
RIP Ken You were/are my hero and will be missed by so many
KB43VER!!!!!!
There is not 1 person on this entire planet. Who could do the most beautiful things in a car that  KEN BLOCK DID!
Rip Ken i hope they have enough tires for you up there. I am glad you guys released the video but they haven't been the same since we lost the king. ❤
Thank you Ken for being the best person for the Motorsports industry. You really gave us all a common ground to work for. You were our rock. Everything you started, and the stories your life holds will live on 43ver ❤
Thanks for everything Ken. RIP ❤
Rip Ken
Rest in Peace you legendary driver.
Moved my wife (@sixspeedsally) and I to a misty (crying) moment there towards the end... thanks, Scotto, Ken, and the team for cranking one more out. In another few years, look for our resumes. We'll sweep the floor to be a part of such a first-class group of enthusiasts.
There are a lot of bad ass mfs out there but no one will ever do it like Ken Block what an absolute legend even ripped tf out of an electric car such a beast number one forever ☝🏽🏆🎉
I like how the paddle shift buttons are the same ones in one of my 2005 Audi A8s, something thats almost 20 years old. Pretty cool. Though I never use them, I think they found a perfect use in the S1
An impossible-to-forget man, we’ll miss you forever Ken
NO TE PUEDO CREER QUE APARECE JUCAAAA 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The best to ever do it!! Thank you Ken for all the crazy fun times!!  #KB43VER
43 KB.
🧙🏽‍♂️4:20 that face 😬....... precision 🤌
Wait a minute were thkse tires on opening burnoit going opposite directions or was that camera makinf it look like that. Like wtf
Thank you, Ken ❤. Role model, idol, goals, etc. I'm glad I got to meet and talk to you a couple of times. #KB43VER
Oh boy what do we have this time
if he could see his daughter now man
KB WAS A FUCKING DEMON AT DRIVING HE WAS IN A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEAGUE
That was hell of a fun on the road. No one will above the same again. Happy to have all gkyham
4:47   Ken block put it on a poster.
....i think i got moist watching this video  feeling a shiver down my spine  his dsughter has some big steps to follow  it will be epic to see her step into her fathers shoes make awesome videos like this
This actually feels surreal. KB43VER.
those last 3 minutes brought a tear to my eye. The mark Ken left on all of us is a very special and powerful thing.  #KB43VER
Goodbye Ken!!!! You'll be forever missed and forever a legend !!! May God be with your family and friends!
Ken Block in all honors - Electric cars have no soul.
i miss ken.
KEN BLOCK A true Pioneer in the automotive industry. He was a legend before he died. Gone way too soon and loved ❤ by many.RIP KEN #43
Ken.... Amazing. Audi electric....Boring! Ive watched Ken in loud petrol powered cars for years, the noise was part of the thrill..... Electric is faster, yes, but they dont exite. I was skipping this video....ive never done that on a Ken Block petrol powered vid Do 70mph in a 1275GT Mini Clubman down some twisty lanes, or 60 mph in a Land Rover Defender off road, the smell, the noise even the lack of power are all part of the fun.  Ive got 4 Defenders, a V8 Range Rover Classic and a Diesel MSRT Custom...... In the future....No fuel? no problem, 3 of the Defenders run on cooking oil.  Ken your a legend. Miss you buddy.😔
KB💚
Rip ken block ‚ you helped many others even me made me get into cars and drift i am happy for ur success in life i am really sad about ur death and hope to see ur daughter carry on the legacy of gymkhana 43ver
WE LOVE YOU KEN. YOUR LEGACY WILL FOREVER BE HONOURED IN THE RACING WORLD
Miss you bunches Ken. Thank you for everything you did for the world. You made it a better place and i'm glad to say I lived when Ken Block did. <3
I miss this man so much. He’s the reason I own 2 fiesta st. He left behind such a great legacy, RIP Ken. Motorsports misses you
Rest in peace to the goat you and your work will live on forever
#KB43VER
Thank you Ken.  We miss you.
Ken.... The legend!
One of the biggest reasons I got into cars since I was a kid. #KB43EVER ❤
I know this must have been hard to finish for scotto, thanks for getting it done and it was a very good one dude, KB would be happy
Truly one of the greatest drivers and inspirations the world has ever known. RIP Ken, you will be sorely missed #KB43VER
🫡
I am a MAN. IS IT WRONG TO TEAR UP?  .HE BROUGHT SO MUCH TO THE WORLD!
Sounds like an angry life size Traxxas Slash… 🤘
una lavadora haciendo trucos XD
And people say that you can’t have fun in an electric car 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Perfect get away  car
Gone to soon
Natay piman daytuy. Naunkel nga uray la. Naspak
We all shed a tear today together, but also, we all got to share one more smile with Ken! Mr. Block you can rest easy and super proud that your legacy is being carried forward in good hands!! RIP KB43FOREVER
Hail to the king, but come on…  Can we all take a second here to laugh about how hard he annihilated that reflector at 6:03?  Hahaha sucks we’ll never see him do anything new, but it’s awesome to see this footage.  Rest In Porsches good sir
RIP
Inspiring. Thanks hoonigan team🤘
Rest in peace Legend #KB43VER  ❤
Was it cool, yeah, kind of. But the highlights were the credits. No doubt the E-tron is an amazing engineering feat, but just seems like it has no soul.  Love Ken block, and #Kb43ver, just doesn’t have the same “oomph” as all the previous ones.  Guess it’s the future though…
Gone but never forgotten. Love and peace my hero❤️. Thank you for the great time and joy you brought to me. Respect to the Hoonigan family from the Netherlands 🇳🇱
RIP Legend
I miss Ken….. and engine noise
Una leyenda!! No hay piloto como el 🙏 y jamás lo vamos a olvidar.
A legend taken way too early. As another angel gains their wings. Fly high and fast Ken, we will miss you!
It's been great working for you Ken. See ya when I see you.
Que bien el juca en ese video con el bocho👌
Truley one of the greatest
Some of the most amazing men in motorsports passed away in the last year
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤❤❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤❤
ICE cars have way more soul to these videos
Vaya con dIos, cabrOn
🎉🎉🎉🎉 hasta que sirvió de algo el AIFA ... GRANDE KEN!!! Hasta donde estés
ของแทร่คนนี้😢
Spectacular. Amazing stuff. The one and forever only KB.
Idk electric cars just dont do it for me like a combustion engine in a gymkana
Why switch to eletric
#KB43VER 😢😢😢
RIP King
... What's it say when the last three minutes and 30 seconds are the best thing about this video? I feel like they either ran out of ideas for this one or the car just wasn't up to the task of handling the rigors of a normal Ken Block 'Khana.
4:20 ken just closing his eyes and hoping when he slams his foot down the cars gonna grip is the best thing ever
really just hit even harder after watching this. RIP Legend.
R.I.P KEN BLOCK WHAT A LEGEND 🕊️🕊️
Outstanding video! I'm going to miss Ken #kb43ver
Definitely HOON AGAIN Ken Block! R.I.P. So much RESPECT!
thank you ken! <3
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Only ken, would do a reverse entry in reverse.
#KB4ever
I can't believe this is the last Gymkhana as well as that he is no longer with us 😢 Thanks for the great memories and for creating in me a passion for cars and racing. I hope to see you again someday wherever you are now Ken. #KB4EVER ❤
That was electric
Rest In Peace Legend 😢🙏🏻🕊️💔
Ken Block still is the best in my heart ❤🎉🎉🎉❤
What a badass
Love ya KB.
We miss you Ken #KBforver43
Was some of this computer generated? Video games have come too far and now you need to step your camera game down to look real haha.
Big Love, miss ya Brother 🤙🏼!
still missing the legend <3
I don't think... I cared about the videogame like that...... palmer bad Kris is tan because she is from Mexico. I have to get things done and improve
i know he is alive in our hearts. but is he in the real world still?
Definitely had a few tears watching this one, knowing this was his last one. Thank you Ken. Rest in peace. #kb43ver
Steve jobs in motorsports
Most overrated "driver" of all time.
I used to play with race games and only use Ken's cars, I'll miss you
RIP Mr Block.
Thanks guys.....I needed that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is ken still alive?
Rest In Peace, Ken. We miss you. #KB43VER 🤟
Rest in peace legend. ❤
I love you
It's been almost a year already
Ken Block ALWAYS has been, and ALWAYS will be the GREATEST driver this planet will ever get the pleasure of watching, truly an inspiration to watch and will forever be loved and missed by so many 😢 my children will grow up knowing about this absolute legend ❤ KB43VER 🕊♾️🏆
Fun fact: El AIFA estaba funcionando con normalidad, no tuvieron que cerrar el tráfico para la grabación
My very first automotive influence, Thankyou for all you have ever done Mr Block
I’m sorry but electric car just not the same compared to his other rides
Shouldve waited till next year, jan 2 tbh
RIP Ken Block.  I may have found out about him this year, but because of him I now have a bigger passion to get into race/rally racing.
Freaking legend man. He will go down in history. Legends never die #KB43VER 😭
God... we miss you..we always be,thank you  for everything  you did  for  us.. RIP...
Not a peep from electric car haters.
r.i.p. ken
RIP Ken. I miss when Hoonigan put out stuff like this. Unfortunately it’s a shell of its former self without Ken.
His legacy lives on and will do for a very long time. The things this legend did with cars is astonishing. Missed by all but certainly not forgotten. ✌️
Only KB can make an electric ⚡️ car cool … gone too soon
Never seen him have to fight a car so hard before, he was probably one of the few people in the world that could do this
This was the only guy to convince me that electric cars could be awesome. Rest easy Ken👌🏾
Never thought watch someone rip around a city like would drive me to tears rip ken you will be missed
Coulda had a V8 lol
It's so unfair that we lost this man... I remember watching the Gymkhanas with my dad since I was 8 and I'm still doing it now that I am 23! Thank you for all the good moments that you gave us! #kb43ver ❤
"if your not scared your not going fast enough" -KB43VER
Beautiful ending tribute, he will be missed ❤
RIP #KB43VER
Got chills from the credits like literally, got chills. BRB ima go cry in my racecar
He’s drifting on a COD map 🤣💪🏻
Long live the #hoonigod #KB43evr
always in our minds
Cant wait for the next Gymkhana with Lia Block at the helm!
Always and forever a legend!
o melhor do mundo
Papá Block left us the gift of Electrikhana. Now what are we going to do with it?! EV tech is awesome and I can't wait to see what other innovations it brings to the world of Motorsports. Also this is a great video, but can we appreciate how fire that intro with the 4WD "Opposing Burn-out" actually was? #hooniganstyle
He will be dearly missed. He wasn’t one of the best Drivers in the world, he was the best and no one will ever compare to Ken Block.
IT WILL ALWAYS BE KB43VER ❤️ We miss you man!
I could do that 😅
how the axles take 6:03 is crazy
I understand no one here likes electric cars but Ken block was the only one that made us think they were cool
great last performance ken REST IN PEACE Legend!!!
I wish I could give this video a million likes by myself what a great guy what a loss.  My condolences to his family. Rip KEN!!!!
Ride in peace Ken 43ver
Выполнение на высоте !!!!но!очнь большое но!!!!где звук то!!я как будто кусок метро себе в ухо вставил!!!а так хуйня))))
Absolute legend
There was never better.
The outro to this video just brought tears to my eyes! Ken Block has been an inspiration to so many including myself. Ken definitely paved the way for so many and it's been amazing to follow his journey. I can only hope his daughter Lia Block has a long and successful racing career and carries her fathers name proudly ❤️
Gymkhana Two was the first gymkhana I saw and where I found Ken Block, it's ironic Eletrikhana is the last one I will see. RIP to the king of rally cars
Long live the king, you will be missed Ken block
RIP Ken.  But I need to mention something:  His skills were always on point but I found the videos less interesting (less thrilling to watch) since he was using the EV.
Estoy llorando... cuando pusieron recopilaciones de anteriores gymkanas recordé aquellos dias en los que me reunia con mis amigos en casa frente al ordenador para ver el ultimo video que habia sacado... muy grande, siempre en nuestros corazones
4️⃣3️⃣☠️
Awesome tribute, RIP KB43.
KB43VER
He's on action sports mount Rushmore now, farewell Ken, you were a real one.
What a legend. I Remember my dad showing me a video of some insane dude racing and jumping through the streets of San Francesco and I was hooked. Im so glad it was Ken who changed my life, #KB43VER.
Like Elon would say, earth is going to miss you man! 😑😐🤘👊👍👌❤️
El mejor!!!!
Ken Block por siempre 🙌🏻 43 debería de ser inmortal! Videos únicos y siempre al extremo! Que no nos sorprenda que Lia algún día siga con estos vídeos
KB43VER in our hearts.
NEVER FORGET THE ONE'S THAT TOOK THE CAR SEEN TO A HOLE NEW LEVEL AROUND THE WORLD   43EVERKB
What....? Ahi esta juca y el vocho
Ruhe in Frieden, du wirst nie vergessen werden und in unseren Herzen leben, eine Ware legende, wir vermissen dich, ich wünsche allen freunden und Familie mein herzliches Beileid #KB43VER
KB❤
What A Legend 🔥
Gracias por todo KEN 😢
He wasn’t only one of the greatest person to slide across the world, but he was one of the greatest to be on the world. Fly high, #KB43VER
Absolutely Phenomenal Rest In Peace 🕊️To The Most Amazing Driving Legend Of All Time You Are Forever Missed Never Forgotten 🙌💪👑King Of The Streets 🕊️Ken Block
Ken will always be a F’n legend ❤️ Thank you for this Hoonigan
true legend, RIP
#KB43VER
Thanks for all you did Ken Block, you're a part of my childhood, I remember making your Impreza WRX Sti painting on my car on Forza Motorsport 3 and 4 and doing drifts with it on the hangar track
Damn I miss this dude RIP to the man the myth the LEGEND.
RIP Ken. But who signed off on the goofy ass fake airplane? 😅
RIP Ken. And thank you for the ride <3
So sad that this is the last Ken video, a true legend and what a masterpiece this video was. The whole team really shined!
Rip legend we all miss you 😢
This one really pulls at the heart. Rarely a day goes by when I don't think about him being gone, you'll forever be missed #KB43VER!!!!!!
Thanks ken & hoonigan, scotto
Ken Block, you were just great! Put a smile on my face no matter what. This Audi is awesome like yourself. I miss you every day. I broke down in tears when you passed and when this video came out. I got an Audi because of you. You were amazing. I pray to God every night to make sure you are doing great and still being the coolest man ever! I will never get over your fate, but I am just thankful that God gave us the coolest guy ever. Thank you, Ken, for making me happy and entertained. I hope to see you in heaven when it is my time to go to the spirit in the sky! Thanks, Hoonigan, for uploading this! Thank you, Ken Block. may you rest in peace! ❤❤❤😢😢😢#KB43VER
🥹
Its crazy its just sounds like a RC car ... lol
I will miss you, I wish you are happy where you are. You change a lot a life. Thank Ken and you will be in my heart 43ver. #KB43VER
He has gone to Valhalla..the place for every God..He is the God of car..all hail to God Ken Block
Still can't believe he is gone and at the same time I am so thrilled to watch this video. Rest easy Legend #KB43VER
I miss these videos drive fast and take chances my brother
What a good dude, can't think of him without thinking of GYMKHANA SEVEN, the 360 U turn in the LA River blew my mind the first time I saw it.  Now watch it over and over.  Super all around guy.
legend
RIP a legend❤️
It hurts
🫡
We miss you Ken, keep shreddin tires up there for us!
Rip ken, smoked a bowl for him
how did he die and when?
A legend gone way too soon. It was one hell of a ride. 43ver
After this I love Ken as much as ever and hate EVs even more. No soul.
Rip
Goosebumps
F to pay respects
Ken block increible pero lo electrico no da mucho espectaculo no hay ruido petardeo nada de combustion
dude im miss him so much :")
I’d say rest easy but we all know he’s up there throwing something through a corner!!!!!
Biggest motor sports icon in the world god bless his family for having such an amazing man in there family rest in great peace Ken Block always and forever 43
R.i.p I'm not sure the world has even realized how great a loss we suffered when we lost this man. One of the greatest drivers of all time and an amazing ambassador for car colture and racing. Imo much love for him and his. This world will never be the same without him. #KB43VER
An absolute legend that touched the lives of more people than he could have ever imagined. This seemed like a great tribute.
#KB43VER
RIP TO THE GOAT 🐐
I just watched a porn movie, with 20 cumshots
Bro’s back for more awd drifting
Gone to soon never forgotten
Kind of didn't want to watch it, because watching it means that's it. Thanks Ken for showing impossible things can be done.
LEGENDARY KB
#KB43VER
Thank you to the block family and the whole hooligan team. I hope that the process of finishing this film helped you process. 43 forever!
What a legend! He'll be forever missed! Would have loved to see him race the Hoonitron against his daughter in the Hoonicorn, that would have been so much fun!!... sigh.
So Amazing perrón!!!  Min 4:08 It's El JUCA???  Mexican "King of tunning"  😅 🇲🇽🔥
Thank you all so much for sharing this. I’ve never felt loss like this for someone that I didn’t have the honor to know on a personal level. Ken is missed so much and I feel foolish for taking him for granted while he was still with us. I have watched and rewatched so much of the content that he was so integral to and feel so much sorrow and sadness for all those who truly got to know and work with him. I can’t even imagine how much he had to mean to his family and friends that worked with him to make so much amazing content. Much love to you all. Keep Leah wrapped up in bubble wrap as she is so much her Daddy’s girl and I can’t wait to see her continued growth and development… she is amazing. ❤❤❤❤
Dam. Just what we all needed!
Truly one of the most talented drivers of our time. RIP Ken. You will be deeply missed.
Absolute daredevil that re-wrote the book, what an epic human, humble and so very missed by all of us Motorsport folks. Gutted that he's not still with us. RIP Ken , sorely missed 💔❤🏁
こう見るとやはり、エキゾーストサウンド、シフトチェンジでパンパンとアンチラグの作動音にファンはエクスタシーを感じるんだなと思っちゃう。物足りねー。
Another great one! ❤
Still d boss ,humble person will miss ur videos ken
Car YouTubers: We’re driving in “Mexico”.  Ken Block driving in Mexico:    43ever. RIP Ken.
We will always miss this legend. May He Rest in Paradise ❤️🫡🕊
WE MISS YOU!
That Marks in the AIFA will stay forever!
Как они снимали это в городах? Перекрывали траффик?😮
Rip💚
GOAT
the ending made me cry a happy tear
Unbelievable!
Cartel was looking for him for shutting the city down
10 hours and less than 1 million views, Hoonigan has fallen. The first electric one sucked and this one won’t be any better.
What a freaking legacy Ken Block has left for us to remember him by. Legends never die. #KB43VER
Thank you Scotto for given  is one last ride with the legend  kb43
Sorely missed, RIP Ken. Another epic drive
Still hurts
So happy to see him drive one more time. ❤ #KB43ver
RIP
Legends never die 🚗💨 KB43VER💯
Not just top driver but a top bloke. ❤
My favorite driver and my favorite city together ❤ RIP Legend, we miss you so much 🥲
I am not crying, I am not crying, I am not crying, I am not crying... I am not...
I clicked. But once I saw it was electric.  Hard pass. Maybe 30 sec in.
Thanks for everything, legend!!! Hoon in heaven!!! ♥️♥️♥️ #kb43ver
43 forever
Truly a blessing to have one final lap with Ken. I will cherish these videos forever. Rest in peace, legend. #KB43VER
#KB43VER❤
almost been a full year already rip ken block
legend
Thanks for adding some rad shit to my life, Ken.
RiP Mr Block
A master at his game, a legend in name. RIP Ken, and tank you for all the awe and wonder that you created for us all
RIP one of the best to ever do it. So glad to see his legacy being carried on by his family. Looking back at the last few videos of him sharing his knowledge with his daughter are bitter sweet. He passed the torch.
Thank you for all the amazing videos and memories. Big part of my upgrowing and young adult years. What a memorial for the eternity. ❤
All this does is make me think how shitty the fast and furious movies are when they pick camera angles and stunts
4:07 No esperaba ver al buen juca por aquí!
Man is a fucking LEGEND!!. Will be missed greatly.
RIP KB43VER!
He probably should have slowed that snowmobile down
I overcook my Cyclone II in GTA5, too. Don't worry Ken, you'll get the hang of it. Oh wait...
what a bad day to be a set of tires lol
i remember being 12 and buying dirt 3 just to drift in ken blocks car and staying up late playing it on school nights. i’m 25 now and i can’t help but to shed some tears watching this.
Can we please get a collection of KenKhana films as a continuous live stream? It would be one of my most watched things ever! May he rest in peace and keep on making them thick fluffy clouds.
Hopefully Lia keeps this tradition going 😢
Drivers who have a staged set up aren't real drivers. Just doing spins and power slides. Not cool not skills. Ari Vatanen is better. Smokey nagata is better. Dale Earnhardt was better. I can name a who fucking list for hours. Colin is the true rslly car god and will always be. Who td gets killed my a snowball what a loser
Already almost a year.... wow... still can't beleive he's resting...  #legendsliveforever #KB4EVER
RIP brother and thank you for the show
Great send off. The ending made me choke up quite a bit.
#KB43VER ❤
Ken Block! the best!
Thank you Ken, Hoonigan, Monster, and GoPro.
Thanks You Ken,We Miss You ♥️  #KB43VER
KB43VER 🧡  There are old racers, and there are bold racers. There are no old, bold racers. Ken will be missed, but the awe and memories he gave us will persist
Jeez its almost been a year, Ken seemed like just one of the coolest people to ever meet. RIP.
#KB43VER
I miss him so much, rest in drift 😢
Ken block. A legend and a great father. Rip brother.  #KB43VER
January, 2 really needs to be  - Ken Block Day
😢😢😢#KB43VER
I’m not crying, you are crying
THE FINAL CHAPTER .... big thanks to all of you guys <3  ..... #KB43VER
True inspiration ❤ I remember watching first one with my dad and we watched each one every time at least 200 times
So grateful we got one last film. Thank you Ken. Thank you Hoonigan. KB43VER ❤
I don't understand why that car has a gearbox if supposed its electric
Enough to make a grown man cry rest easy Ken and thanks for the memories❤️
What a blessing to get this final video. Sad but happy. RIP Legend
HooniLEgend
How did they get the airport shut down that’s insane
Ken da real OG
RIP MATE FOREVER LOVE !
The fact that we got a posthumous gymkhana makes me beyond happy and also incredibly sad😭
Damn these allergies
RIP
Greatest To Ever Do It!🦾
We miss you brother
You can't not love this. KB you were the man when it came to auto sports. Went from internal combustion monsters to fully electric monsters. Thank you for embracing the change that is coming.
😍😭❤
Thanks for everything, Ken. You inspired me and countless others to slay all tires and hoon everything. You changed the game with what you and your team did and I don't know if anyone will be able to reach that bar you left up there.
Absolutely a legend ❤
You are amazing!!!
Thank you for everything Ken, a true idol for a lot of us.  RIP #KB43VER
I usually don't watch a YouTube video without skipping through to the good parts.  Except this one ❤
RIP HHIC. Loved the montage at the end.   2.1 still my favorite.    The E tron looks like a 1:1 scale RC car.    The next Travis edition should be Patrana-kahna
#KB43VER ❤
Love the little behind-the-scenes bites. Will forever remember that laugh.
Made me happy and sad at the same time
is he driving a car？！ Man！
Did he die or something hows he making YouTube videos
RIP Ken Block he will NEVER ever be forgotten.  He is A LEGEND like Pual Walker in My heart and my son or daughter will know him deffinently in the future. #KB43EVER
Rest in peace. Truly a gearhead who was damn good at it.
<am i really love the gas engine sound more but what a man!
Rest in peace bro I watched all your videos u r an inspiration to millions including myself
So good to see Ken ripping one last time, but damn, that ending montage hit me right in the feels. 😢
#KB43VER
Crecí viendo a ken, es y será siempre un ídolo un referente del automovilismo... Duele pensar que ya no está, fuerza a la familia .. saludos desde chile 🇨🇱
This was a very good surprise today. I thought I would never again see the amazing stunt driver Ken Block! RIP ❤
I will forever miss you brother thank you R.I.P. TIRE SMOKE FOREVER
Crazy it isn't in his mustang But can wait to see what his daughter does next.
🏁🏁🏁
Rip
1 last ride ❤
Never forget Ken Block #KB43VER
I don't often comment on YouTube, but this was worth the effort. Thanks Ken and Hoonigan. #KB43VER
Tears man. That first 2008 montage clip at the end really got me. That was the true beginning of my love for cars. It all started with Ken. 43ver.
RIP Ken! #KB43VER
#KB4EVER
i was holding it together until the outro music started to play... #KB43VER
We love you ken block you will always be missed I will be sure to make my kids watch these masterpieces as they grow up😢
Magnificent as usual! See you on the otherside Ken
Simply the best. And always for ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We will always miss you and your talent and your drive to be the best at everything that you do Mr. Ken Block you were a BEAST behind the wheel of a car you are and always will be remembered
RIP legends never die!
Legendary. If you watch with surround sound you can appreciate the sound design as well
Terrific tricks 👏 👌 👍 😀 😄 🙌 👏 👌.    But boring sound of the electric  Audi 😴 😑 😒 🙄 😕 😐 😴
Like por el JUCA 😅
Man o man do we all miss you Ken.
meh...
En el AIFA!! Pues si, No hay nadie ahí...!
Came for the stunts, left with the feels. Man was an inspiration to car guys everywhere, he will be missed always, gone way too soon. #KB43VER
The credits were edited better than the video
Wow....just wow. Goosebumps upon goosebumps upon goosebumps. I hold my breath on every slowmo shot. And then you hit us with the tear jerker outro. Who'd have thunk we'd be crying watching the Hoonigan channel. Fuck man. RIP good sir. #kb43ver 💚🖤💜🩵
Amazing driving and an incredible car. However I found myself watching without feeling, without emotion and it’s because of the boring sound of the electric motors and tyre squeal. The high revving engines evoke passion to match the visual spectacle.
I imagine people who believe that Mexico only has donkeys, sand and old houses and seeing that it is something completely different and modern shocked
it's like, I wish I could be Ken in a video game... let alone everything he got to accomplish.  43ver...
Meh. These have gotten pretty boring
43VER A LEGEND. Scotto said it best: He's doing what we wish we could do 🤘. His legacy will continue through his wife and daughter.
Thanks Guys for releasing this. I was always looking for the next Ken Block video. Miss him so Damn much. KB43ver.....
One last Hoon. And what a run it was. RIP Ken. Thanks for showing us all what living life full send is all about.
😩
Que mal suena eso
Thank You Ken for everything🤘🏻
How many tires were harmed in the making of this film? 😂
I miss ken so much.  RIP to an absolute legend of a human
My man was beating that Hoonitron, love to see it, RIP legend
He was driving that mfer 😂😂
Thank you for everything, Ken. 💕🥹
Rest in peace you absolute legend.
Thank you 🙏🏼
One of the best videos I’ve seen great montage at the end really loved it KB forever
All hail the Hoonigod Ken Block!
at first i kinda thought the lack of an explicit emotional opening was in poor taste, but then the car started moving and I was instantly corrected. Dude pulled off in real life what most of us couldn't even do in video games, the only tribute worth giving him is "in memory of Ken Block.... the sickest shit you'll ever see a car do in your life."
RIP
Th end 🥲 #KB43VER
But in memory of Ken Block Snow go top Off the roof was to late.
Miss you buddy!❤ Time to start remaking these with Lia!
😢
Can't believe it's been that long already. Missing this man you are the goat. #KB43VER
Thank goodness for this amazing footage, it's like he's still with us!!! You have changed us all, #KB43VER !!  Thank you @hoonigan and @audi for releasing this to us all. What an amazing Christmas Gift!  And at 4:07 his eyes closing like he messed up!  Are there any Out take videos that may make it to the Internet????
Legende 😶‍🌫️
Ken Block.. still drifting from beyond the grave!
Ken closing his eyes @4:21 is the greatest thing ive seen in a while! lol
This was truly amazing and we are all so blessed to have been able to come along this amazing journey and I just want to say thank you to each and every person that works so hard to create all of these truly amazing works of art. #KB43VER. ❤
Ken my brother, thank you for the chills on my arms and keeping me on the edge of YOUR seat with every scene. You are greatly missed brother but we are grateful for you to still be with us in the form of your daughter. Love ya brother 🫶🏽🙏🏽
💯💪🏾💪🏾
RIP THE GOAT <3
Great video we miss it a lot big Big UP from France 🇨🇵👍👌💪😎🔥 caption 43
RIP Ken block a true legend
Who is Ken Block? Idk he seems like a stuck up snob to me with his fancy Tesla probably never driven a real man’s car like me 2001 v6 mustang.
JUCAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Горнолыжный курорт "Игора" (Санкт-Петербург) тебя помнит😎
RIP TRUE LEGEND❤️💐🏵️ #KB43VER
Never have I seen a vehicle produce that much smoke from a reverse burnout didn't know you even could thats so sick rip ken
Rip to a true legend
RIP LEGEND #KB43
QEPD leyenda #KB43VER ♥
Man imagine the wild shit he would've done had we got a chance to see him at Audi just a bit longer!
Interesting, ... no one is complaining about the lack of internal combustion noise. How refreshing.
Feels like yesturday I started my journey into cars my first boss ctsv climbkhana the twerkstallion are probably the three big things that got me into this rip ken
🥹
Epic video, Epic Man, Epic Life.. #KB43VER
am i the only one who drop a tear or two #KB43VER
RIP
Thank you Ken. For 15 years of inspiring and jaw-dropping. You've influenced countless car enthusiasts, myself included.
True Professional.
Banger as always! Sad that it's the last one.... #KB43VER
there is a genuine smile, there is joy, there is heartache
This should be called BLOCKHANA as far more superior form of the gymkhana.  43ver
Truly enjoy the reel at the end. Thanks Scotto.
That was a half of my life. Thank you. Miss you. Don't slow down...
Thank you, Hoonigans. This made my night and it will continue to make many nights in the future. Rest In Power, King Ken.
Aw man, just too soon😥. Thanks for the fun.... Great exit text to racers..
There were two main things that got me into Rally and motorsport in general. My Dad, and Ken Block. Specifically the Top Gear segment with James May was the coolest thing I had ever seen. Thanks for everything Ken. #KB43VER
A legend has gone to rest, but he left us his daughter which is making his dad proud.
Colin McRae DITR2 FOREVER 🤜💥🤛✊🏼😈🤙🏼
Even the late great KB can’t make electric cars exciting lol
I watched in silence    And shedded a tear
Fucking legend
This was bery butt puckering 🥳
uye
Ever since watching him droft London, he's been nothing but a bad influence on me. Now, I try driving like this on my drive home after work every night. Seriously though, i hate that I only recently found Ken Block. He was gifted, to say the least.
Legends never die we will always bin thinking and watching's your videos thank you ken and hooligan inspired so many <3
43 FOREVER ❤
Eectrifying!
I was afraid this would remind me that Ken died. Instead it proved that he truly lived!
RIP Ken Block, the man the myth the legend. #KB43VER 🤘🤘
Racings and drifts will be dead if we lose petrol and diesel engines.
You'll be missed ken 😢 ❤
Damn what a legend, RIP
man's did it with paddles how the hell. Gonna miss these ❤️
Loved this guy
#KB43VER
hoonitron is lame af
of blessed memory Ken Block 😥⚒️👈= his Audi S1 ​​Hoonitron + Quattro ⚒️👈= lack of funds for good tires for the Audi Tron🤑😥👈⛽️ Quattro... hmm Audi, I like your drive and gearbox after all. Despite Ken Block, I only love Honda⛽️❤️‍🔥🎯
#KB43VER Lost but you will never be forgotten! We will be telling the next generations to come how they missed a legend...
I wonder how many times yous recharge that battery
LEGEND, nothing more to say. It was so good to see him in a car again and on screen. We will miss you, but your memory will live on ✌
o7
I couldn't help but keep trying to turn the volume up
God Bless Ken Block and all who loved him!
Ahh this is bitter sweet… not sure how to put into words how I’m feeling right now. Thank you for this video. Gutted I’ll never see Ken IRL again but RIP 😢❤
Watching this is so bittersweet. Ken, you were the reason me and so many others got into car culture. Being able to watch your incredible skills all these years has been a blessing. The entire world will remember you for the contributions you made to the community. We will all miss you so much 😭 #KB43EVR
Damn. Who's cutting onions here eh?
Imagine having the opportunity to play forza irl, best hobby ever
Very wise idea not to add music. I feel as though this was kens 11:36 seconds of silence 😔
This one hurt. I am going to miss this man until the day I die, what a legend Ken was. KB43 💚
A true legend.
You my hero Mr. Block 43 forever
Fly high
😍😍
Looks like the call of duty airport. Ken's last ride was a good one I'm really going to miss his can am riding spot videos. RIPKB
Petrol engine please...
Legends live forever. Who else can back a car in a over a 140 miles per hour and drive out to other side.
RIP Brother
#KB43VER
Name of the song at the end of the video
A dreamer that inspired a generation. We’ll keep killing tires for you brother KB43ver
Thanks guys, im crying now😢
The greatest to ever do it! Rip KB43❤️
This 💯 gave me goose bumps the world will never be the same but for ever in spirit Ken will live on 43VER 🫶🏻
You will never be forgotten, you were a inspiration for so many people, you changed car filmography for ever, #KB43VER
KB43..  the legend will be missed forever.
fucking ninjas cutting onions
An end of an era, you will be missed Ken
You will be missed 😢 and never forgotten.
RIP Ken. U da man 🤙🏻
I was watching Dakar Rally  last  year. And I heard the name Ken Block.  I was thinking Ken Block was Racing the Dakar Rally.  😢😢😢  there was the sad news 😢.  I mis you   Ain't Care. Love you ❤
I know its powerful and all but this just seems boring to me
not as many gimmicks and jumps as previous works...but it honestly didn't need them. just a wild ride start to finish showcasing nothing but talent start to finish. glad to see this finally out.
thanks for the great memories boys! fly high ken
Damn i was hoping last few frames was the clip of Ken saying...."Don't be an asshole"
We miss you ken, thank you for all the years going way back to my childhood when I was so excited to play DIRT3 just because of gymkhana. Hope you're creating more drift clouds up there
Que grande juca!!!!!!
Was truly and honor
OMG!!! 😮 El #AIFA ❤
I still can't believe he's gone. Sadly reminds me of when we lost Dave Mirra, you just don't want to believe it. RIP to both 😢
He is the dale Earnhardt of our lifetime. Probably bigger
we miss and love you Ken #kb43
KB43VER
Legendary.
Loved by many. Respected by all.
The Show Must Go On......
And people say electric cars have no soul.
What a legend! KB43VER
#KB43VER
You will always be missed! Sounds exactly like my electric RC Cars I grew up with.
Legend doing legendary things. Rip Ken, smoking tires in heaven.
Dead almost 12 months, still making money off his name
43 ❤️
Hopefully Lia Block will be able to continue with gymkhana videos
Here to pay respects and to simply say, thank you Ken. This is a masterpiece.
Are you sure this is Mexico City? I thought Mexico was sepia-toned.
Was it going to be his last one regardless or it ended up being is his last because of untimely death?  Ken Block will live on forever❤
I'm emotional watching this even from Africa. I live and breath KB......RIP to a God of the clutch and pedal........ electric lost the soul of what Hooning is, it's all the soul without the spice. No one can replace my hero, but maybe DDE can carry on the tradition especially with the uploading of the f12. To the hooni squad I love and appreciate you guys, thanks for this vid, it means a lot to hold our legend on the pedestal that he deserves. SALUTE TO THE GREATEST
I had to shed a tear watching this one. I am so glad you had one more to give us Ken this is the last memory he would want us to have ❤
❤
Words can't describe how much he is and will continue to be, missed.
❤KB43VER❤
One last ride by the legendary Ken Block ❤❤
Ken was a hero you will never be forgotten legendary
Such an amazing man who has inspired millions. You will forever be remembered. R.I.P. Ken #KB43VER
I'm 27 years old and don't really plan on having kids.   But if I do they will know about Ken block.
How many battery charges did that take? Lol

So much love and respect to Ken and his family❤
You will always be the best. #KB43VER
Thank you Ken, for everything that you have contributed to the automotive world, you have truly inspired so many!   #KB43VER
The first ever video I downloaded from YT was the third gymkhana, I was so blown up that I had to show it to all of my friends. You'll be missed Ken.  #KB43ver
I will always be your fan wherever you are, rest in peace brother, you are and will always be the best. KB43ever😍🥺❤️
i still love that hairpin scene
RIP Ken. This just isn’t as cool as the sound of the twin turbo v8 hoonicorn screaming through a sequential transmission disturbing the peace through London!
Race in Peace Legend, thank you for everything. You will be missed.
That’s a lot of Vaping
Me and the homies hate snowmobiles now. Rip to the goat
4:40 is absolutely ridiculous. It doesn’t even look real, almost like the car is being pulled to the left by a magnet or something
rip. what a video to watch...
Legend 💚🖤🤍
Legend!
I love how at any time in his life he could of turned down these risky performances, but it wasnt about the money for him, he loved showing us something we have never seen before and how good of a driver he was, thats my perception at least
How tf did they get an airport shut down for this
Rip ❤❤❤❤❤
RIP TO THE KING
Amazing to think we now can drive full sized RC cars... And really the new limit is on tire traction, so the next frontier would be to brrak that limit. How? Unsure but the endless pursuit of innovation and new frontiers will be the reason
Wow, 2 months later, he was gone. Still hard to fathom to this day. RIP KB
I hope Lia keeps the series going.
I've never been one to really care about celebrity's at all, but ken was different, he got me into cars, and that's a big part of my life now as I'm a mechanic and love fast cars and drifting, so hearing about his passing actually hurt, and I'm sure that goes for many other people, we love you man.
I can’t even watch this.   Because it’s fucking boring.  So fucking boring you had to add sound affects to it, and it’s still boring.
#43 number ONE
Legend never die ❤ 🤙
KB … has amazing car 🚗 control 👏💯🤜🏾🔥👋🙌
One last ride, thanks Ken.
This was tough to watch knowing he's  no longer with us. Such a good human.
Rest in peace brother 🕊️💚
LONG LIVE #KB43VER 🕊
still hurts
You were a legend and an inspiration to so many people. RIP man we miss you and hope to shred with you again when our time comes.
I am glad the waited to release this. I was missing out on how silly and amazingly easy he made all the stunts seem.
I can imagine it was difficult to put this video together, and push the upload button. But I'm glad you did. I think it's a fitting tribute. Shredding tires and shredding onions. 🥲
No one can ever do drift like ken block
Thank you for your service 🙏🖖🌌
Greatest driver hands down. Better than Jason Bourne and Jason statham in transporter.💯🤘🇺🇲 KB43VER
That car sounds like a beastly rc car   RIP master Block gymkana grand master
What a legend!!!!
Thank you Ken ❤❤ shoutout scotto and everyone that put this together. He truly was the greatest.😢
a great sendoff, wish it could have gone for longer but some of the best stories end early to keep the ending impactful and that he was. Thanks Ken and the Whole Hoonigan team for making millions of automotive enthusiasts happy. KB43VER
Legends never die 🥺❤
The world of driving is going to get a lot more dangerous when most economy cars have electric motors making 400whp.
I came here to smile and cry
So friggin epic as usual for Ken. A total wizard of wheels. May he rest in peace, well maybe rest in speed? KB4EVR
Amazing to see the previous runs tire marks and how much work goes into these runs!!
Always on top! Such a level of control and reflexes just boggles the mind! The look of focused intensity on his face (when shown) iss almost scary! Glad to see Lia keeping the legacy alive! Expecting great things from her!😁
Im not crying youre crying
Knowing Ken he went towards the pearly gates bouncing off the rev limiter in top gear
The Greatest Driver Who Ever Lived On This Planet! I Will Never Forget You!
Кен, спасибо тебе за все подаренные моменты в автоспорте, ты вдохновил тысячи людей рисковать и не быть осуждённым, ты будешь до конца жизни в наших сердцах, и возможно у следующего поколения будут свои легенды, но твоё Имя навсегда закрепит слово "риск", ещё раз спасибо, покойся с миром легенда.🤎
#KB43VER
Ken Block, is and was the definition of the saying "drive it like you stole it", Love to the Block family. RIP Ken. Will be truly missed, But also thanks to Lia for living up to the Block family name and a perfect fit for anyone that could be even close to filling Ken shoes or replicate and innovate what Ken does. Much love to the Block family and thanks for continuing and adding on to his legacy.
If you ever needed more proof that Gen-Xers rule...here's your sign!
It’s amazing how these stunts didn’t kill him. RIP
Thank you Ken
Will always remember you! From the first Gymkhana I was so amazed at your skill!! Rest in Peace my Brother ❤
RIP M.r Block.... and those tires, holy moly.
A moment of silence for that camera that Ken decided to smoke for our pleasure.  You will be missed...
❤🥲
lol sounds like my rc cars which isnt a bad thing
I just miss him so much!  #KB43VER
It's still hard to believe he's gone...
If there was ever a more exciting driving event than Ken Block's Gymkhana, then I don't know what it was.
RIP Ken, sadly missed never forgotten ❤❤
Shut up, I'm not crying. you're crying!
And a stupid snowmobile accident. Rip my dude.
Legend. #KB43VER
If only he new his death date, dude defiantly would have went on a run across the united states running from cops!
Puro Amor Por El Señor Ken Block!❤️🇲🇽 Siempre!! #KB43VER ❤️❤️
#KB43VER 💔
Thank you, Legend.
I’ve never been so happy  and so sad
Kens up there showing dale Earhart how to drift🙏
It brings me so much happiness to see him shred the tires off the spaceship one last time!!!  KB43VER!!!
He started on an airfield , he finished at an airport. Legend! Rip
@dailydrivenexotics @damonfryer
RIP to a real one!  ♥♥♥ from Canada
Thank you so much, eternal 🙏😭. Juca, now the vocho is  legend  😍 😎 🙌
He lived to see the rise of electric powerplants and then drove the hell out of them too. May you rest amongst the stars king.
o7
THE GOAT!
Every day I miss you Ken. Even though I never got the chance to meet you, the good you’ve done for me and countless others will forever be in history. Glad we got to see you one last time doing what you did best.
It was hard to watch through the water works, but all the great memorys, the laugh, the smile,  just everything about this great man makes you still laugh. R.I.P KB43ver, just know your baby girl is keeping your memory alive in all of us, Like father like daughter. Thank you to Hoonigan for sharing this with us.
RIP Legend
Thank you Ken block for the joy you brought to many. Drift high🕊️
Love you man❤ everyone misses you😢 fly high man, i hope your friend travis picks up where you left off or your daughter someone needs to carry on your legacy.... there will never be another you but it cant end here
Legends never die. Rest in peace you will never be forgotten.
Ken truly made me love cars, he introduced me to my favourite motorsport, and he helped create one of the greatest names in the world of cars. Just because he loved it.  We could only hope to see stunts half as good one day  The track down the road smells like burning rubber, but it just might be Ken #43VER
RIP Ken Block. The HooniKing
#kb43ver ❤❤❤
DEP LEYENDA...
KB43VER
You could tell this dude just loved what he was doing!! Smiling while hitting those turns! God bless his daughter 🙏  RIP KB 43!! 🙏
Hail to the king 👑
As a Mexican, Hoonigan I need to thank you for continously inspiring enthusiasts globally. Thank you Ken.
Miss you Ken, R.I.P, you will ALWAYS be remembered.
The Bigman <3
Спасибо что стал кумиром для многих миллионов❤ Легенды вечны.
❤❤❤❤
I would love to be a rally driver, and I would wanna be like Ken... R.I.P.
Ken you always amazed me each time I'd see a new video come out. Your racing legacy and driving stunts will never be forgotten. Keep destroying all tires in the sky for us all
ken is going to live for ever on line and never be forgotten
I miss him so much I'm glad to see that there was still one video left. It would be cool to see a long video with a bunch of Ken blupers and other stuff that never made the videos
the best to every slide a car!
you’ll be missed KB
I am so happy that this Final Adventure was able to happen and be brought to the world. 🥲 Ken was and for ever will be a Champion of All Champions. 🎉🎉🎉 This video made me wince, cringe 😬, gasp 😱 😮, and then tear up. 😢 I screenshot a couple of moments from this one to post to my KB43VER page on Pinterest.  Scotto, I appreciate you and the crew for doing this and bringing One Last Ride of the Amazing One to the masses my friend.  A Million Thanks to the HOONIGAN Squad. 🎉🎉🎉🎉
GOAT !!! You will always be remembered as one of the few legends behind a steering wheel!! <3
RIP those tires
As awesome as this is, it's so hard to watch. All of us miss you Ken. Thank you for EVERYTHING
❤Ken Block!!!
RIP. Legends don't die, and Ken will continue to inspire the hoons among us.
Gone but never forgotten. RIP Ken. You will be 43ver missed.
See you when we all get there Ken!  Until then, know you are loved & missed dearly!
43ver
Este vídeo sería mejor si no hubiese salido el ridiculo del llamado juca
#KB43VER
Ken that was truly incredible, like many others I grew up watching gymkhana am thankful for your HUGE impact on the car community and car culture as a whole. KB434EVR
Happy, excited, nostalgic and sad. All at the same time. Thank you Ken Block. PS: I have his age and kids in same ages. It gets to me every time I see or read something about him. Sending some good vibes to the Block family (and his crew, you are almost family right? 😋).
RIP Ken you were one hell of a driver!!❤KB43VER
Holy shit I’ve been watching this for a while…
This was 100000x better than the new GTA trailer 🎉
Shocked, amazed, inspired, and definitely didn't get emotional... as always great job. Ken will always be remembered for his impact on those who viewed him. ❤
Ken block was THE man, he lived life.
Such a talant. Will always have his videos.  Made everthing look like a regular drive to work. Amazing man and even more amazing how they were able to close down part of an airport to make this video. God speed ,KB.
RIP 43
RIP LEGEND
Rest in peace wizard 🤟🏻
Gone but never forgotten 🙏 Unfortunate the last one was in a electric car. Gonna miss the engine/exhaust and gear changes 😢
Sounds like I’m watching a rc car video 😂😂 the fricken dopest rc car video ever tho 🤙🏽 well done also I’ve never seen anyone else do a parkade drift like that besides in Tokyo Drift! That was so sick
The ending though. Im not crying you are.
My heart sank a little when I saw the thumbnail.
This further proves how special Ken was and the skills he had. He will always forever be missed but will live on in our hearts. I can stop getting over how amazing he was and how much he impacted the world. R.I.P Ken Block, keep slaying in heaven
Спасибо Кен за все эти шоу! Первое произвело революцию в восприятии раллийных автомобилей, и имя Ken Block навсегда врезалось в авто культуру, став именем нарицательным! Раллийные техники перенесённые на бетон и асфальт, и поданные со стилем и эстетикой, подарили много эмоций. И каждое новое видео привносило краски и детскую улыбку в жизнь. Спасибо...
❤❤❤
realizing I watched all of them as they came out. I was driving an antique subaru in 2009. Still in my 30s then. Watching rally videos every day. Daydreams of driving were still there. This last video has spooky sounds, like a hurricane at the windows and doors..going to where dreams don't go. I'll be 51 soon. RIP to Ken, always a great one. 😇
RiP Legend Ken
RIP The greatest legend that the world of motorsports has had 43 forever
It goes with out saying, we all love and miss Ken, but is anyone else missing some rowdy V8 sounds?
Forever a legend, thank you for changing the world #KB43VER
❤Ken was an absolute legend and I still can't believe he's gone! RIP Ken Block 🙏 KB43VER❤
43VER the BEST!
How did it go from fords with beautiful engine sounds to electric Audis? 🤮
Rip ken <3 i miss u man
Rest in rally paradise. Inspiration to many, and a legend to all #KB43EVER
Starts and ends at an airport. Rip 43
Can we see more first person footage
i’ve never cried after a gymkhana video but holy shit we miss you man
This makes me sad. I still haven’t gotten over it. Ken was like my role model for 2 years since I was 12, and he had such a big impact on my, dispite only seeing him through a computer screen. It really sucks to think about how his family and friends must feel, if it can have this big on an impact on me. Rest In Peace Ken. We will never forget you
The end is so hard to watch 😢
It will never be the same without you man.  RIP you are the start of how I found rally.  I hope more people out there start doing their own gymkhana vids.  You are missed, race on! KB43VER
Se me enchino la piel 🤌🤌
waoooo ken :( siempre te recordaremos   hay salio el buen juca
One last ride.. #KB43VER ❤️
The GOAT <3
Thank you hoonigan, Lost for words.
The best for jast, always and forever KEN. Even in an electric beast. He makes it look flawlessly easy. RIP legend.
Gone but never forgotten Ken  #KB43VER
there's never been a bigger inspiration to the car community. hes up there right now with dale paul and senna talking cars and hooning the pearly streets
Sentimos sua falta ken vc foi foda decho um legado enorme #kb43ver
This felt so weird and kind of gross to watch. Did not enjoy it one bit.
We miss you Ken thank you hoonigan team for that
NGL, if this is his last video... what a waste it being an electric car. That sound is so annoying I had to watch the video without volume. He deserved better than electric.
R.I.P Ken Block. An absolute f-ing legend. 🤘 He will be remembered.
Damn still can’t believe Ken is gone 😢 Can’t wait to see Lia in one of these episodes! She’ll carry the legacy just fine I believe
the first time i saw KEN in the subaru hatch i was a amazed as a child and knew i needed one. i now own my own hatch and i give all my thanks to Ken for motivating me to drive my own. you'll always live on in heart.
LOVE
Rip to the greatest driver to ever live
RIP Legend.
@jucaviapri
Всегда тут ❤❤❤
One last ride 😢
🥰
So sad his last Gymkhana was in an EV. 😢
🫡
One of the best drivers of all time.... Rest easy big guy
This is gonna be a hard watch ☹️😔
No cylinder noise or turbo noise , kinda lacking in appeal.  Rip ken💜
this is so beautifull
WE WANT MORE KB43VER!!!
I'm sad now 😢 you will forever be missed ken
rip you will be missed and loved drift high
Still can't fucking believe it
Not gonna lie... I was tearing up a little with this one. Been watching the Gymkhana series since I was in high school with dreams of meeting him one day.   R.I.P to another legend that's gone too soon 💔😭
Посмотрел только из-за уважения к Кену Блоку. Электро-звук раздражает. Где бу бу бу и ра та та ? 🤬
I was not ready for these feelings ❤
ELECTRO SHIT
Miss U Bud
Goodbye Ken, it was always a pleasure watching you. Looking forward to Heavenkhana 😩
Thank you to the block family and everybody at hooligan for putting this out probably wasn’t easy to do that so I appreciate that sincerely from the bottom of my heart❤❤😢
Ken Block, truly a gift who keeps giving!
Legend.
Ken is one of the greats of all times. We'll miss you!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Daddy
This is crazy only thing is I wish his last gymkanna was had the electrics annnoying but rip block
Did Ken get to V-max the car on the runway?
Too soon for me, I'm still in shock he's gone. Grown men crying 😢 KB43VER 💔
That moment when you realize that that's the last film you're gonna see of Ken... the whole world stops for a moment
What an incredible video I wish Ken would have seen it he'll be missed so much his gymkhana videos were a part of my childhood and I've been a fan since Ken you're an icon to many and we'll miss you 43ver ❤️😢🙏🏽👑❤️❤️❤️
Ken block is a legend
43ver Ken Block We are going to miss these videos and they will always be a legend Of the Drift💨❤️🚗
The man is gone and still putting smiles on our faces... rest easy up there my buddy and take it easy on the tires on God's highway 🙏☹️
Chingonometrico
En los días con muchas nubes, recuerden que en el cielo hay un loco ángel con el numero #43 quemando neumáticos, por siempre en los corazones de los fanáticos, muchas gracias  Ken Block 😇😇
RIP - a true game changer & pioneer. Sorely missed <3
We will miss you Ken
Oh Ken
Long live the king!!! We miss you ken. Juca i seeee you
This was really difficult to watch I'm not going to lie. RIP LEGEND
"So we can be done" 💔
Smile on my face and tears in my eyes the entire video. Dammit we'll miss this legend.
Increible! Parece una pelicula, impresionante!
Mindblowing video/editing/camera! Thanks for making Pt 2 happen and sharing it with us. RIP Ken ❤
RIP 43
Rip Ken Block, you're missed by millions. #KB43VER
That's hits hard 😢
That squint at 4:20 had me cracking up lol. We truly lost a legend!
"It's enough to make an old man cry, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗸."
RIP to one of my long time hero’s, what a video
Ken Block forever ❤❤
Ken block was the human embodiment of passion
RIP Ken Block. Also, wasn't that the airport from GTA? lol
TRY NOT TO CRY,LEVEL IDOL ❤ gracias a ken adoro el drift y los coches muchas gracias y besos al cielo
How does someone manage to shutdown an airport to film this?
This is legendary ❤
MAN WE NEED A KB BLOOPERS VID!!!!!!!
the sound of this car is so annoying to listen too, hurts my ears
Truly a legend of the sport. I’ll be waiting to see if Lia picks up where you’ve left off. Rest in power! The automotive world misses you.
Wish we could have seen the legend in the legendary Hoonicorn one last time. RIP Block
A legacy. Thank you for everything Ken & team. You defined a generation with this content.
And just like that, it's over...  I remember watching his first Gymhkana and I couldn't stop watching it.  Then being super hyped when a new one came out.  It's the end of an era.  Rest In Peace, Ken.
thx ken
❤️🙏🕊
rip. we love you. gone but never forgotten. <3
Legend!
Ken Block your an amazing person, and the films you made will live forever your my hero just like Evil was what a great video RIP YOU ARE MISSED !!!!
KB43VER
To think where he could have pushed the Ev game with the Audi collaboration and rally...
Absolut respect and honor to one of the biggest and talented drivers of all times, absolutly a beast on the "tracks" RIP #KB43VER
What an amazing video and super sad at the same time knowing that this is the last one we'll ever see Ken do! He is an icon and changed motor sports forever and will be greatly missed by all of us.  #KB43VER
This was an emotional roller-coaster... seeing him one more time doing what he loves is a gift for me cause i lost my dad in 2021 in January 7th, and Ken passed away the second day of January, so, i feel like this is something similar, cause Lia and me we lost our fathers in similar days, but I'm doing my best to keep up, with one of many lines of Ken:  "Be creative and live a fun life..... and don't be an a**hole"  #KB43VER 💚🖤
You will forever be in the minds and hearts of motorsports enthusiasts even those yet to be born.
4:21 The face I make when this video comes to an end.
For some reason I was thinking of the spike ball drift video 2 days ago from 2013 and thought I'm gonna watch that soon I miss Ken block videos.. I didn't end up watching it and am extremely surprised to see this today.. what a great inspiration even to us who aren't car fanatics but enjoy the art of it.. thanks Ken and your team, a great addition to this generation 👍 👏
It was actually catching a flight to Mexico city, on January 3rd 2022, at like five in the morning that I found out about Ken's passing, it's incredible that it's almost been a year already, he'll be missed, kb 43ver
Miss you Ken. Enjoyed all the Gymkahana videos. #kb43ver
Legends never die KB43VER
Man how did we ever deserve to witness true greatness in the form of Ken Block. RIP #KB43VER
RIP to this legend, played a big part in my childhood and will forever be missed. #KB43VER
Gone but never forgotten. Ken, your legacy will live as long as this sun burns...
RIP Ken, the world is forever missing a legend now, #KB43VER
What a treat to see the great man driving one more time ❤😢
Proving even after death he is an absolute legend! You will always have a place in us carpeople's heart, Ken!
It's nicest
Рыка бензинового мотора конечно не хватает) Но это все хуйня, по сравнению с тем, что с нами больше нет этого Великого чувака😢 Покойся с миром легенда.
Man i cant believe it nearly been a year since he left all us fans, not to mention how his family feels😢
Changed the game forever. Thank you for everything, Ken + thank you, Hoonigan for sharing the final KB43 chapter 💙
KB43VER!!!!
It's been some time since I watched a gymkhana video, but man does this one hurt, he'll be forever appreciated and forever missed.
We all Miss you Ken!
Thank you legend !
Snowmobiles should be banned. It robbed the rest of the world of one of the greatest drivers period . Rest in Peace KB43
All you guys have done such an excellant job.  This is so great to see, yet still we are all here teared up
Long live the legend that is Mr Ken Block, you sir are a true master at shredding tyres with extreme ❤prejudice.  I love that grimace at 4.21mins. And big up to Scotto for the epic editing, those slow mo's trulydo justice to the skill of the man.  I just feel for those toyos...a before and after shot of those would be cool just to appreciate what they have just been thru...❤❤❤
4:20 I felt that. R.i.p Block
Remember when it's a cloudy day, it's Ken burning up tires in Heaven
We’ll all miss you Ken 💔🖤 so sick to see your daughter shredding in your footsteps! True inspiration to us all in car community! Always will be !
He, and he alone could have done this. It’s a shame we won’t get another. Rest In Peace, you will ALWAYS be in our hearts, now, and for years to come ❤
Kb43 4 life ❤ my inspiration for car and most definitely drifting, he will always be alive in his fans heart.🫡
"i always say until the next time because goodbye is to permanent" Goodbye Ken, thank you for the inspiration and the memories...
Thank you Ken for introducing me to the wonderful world of cars you will be missed #KB43VER
The video - "weeeeEEEEEEEeeeeee wwwweeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee".
Didnt think we would get another hoonigan/ Ken Block masterpiece but here we are! thank you to team hoonigan KB4EVER
KB43VER 🙌🙌🙌🙌
2012 still unbeaten
Rest in power to one of the best to ever touch a steering wheel and accelerator
#KB43VER
Sounds like they used their Formula-E motor. Too bad its an audi commerical.
R.I.P. Ken You will be missed Legend!
Again amazing, no one will 43VER do this again, most of all. Don't slow down Ken, N3VER #KB43VER
This has got to be the craziest thing I've ever seen with a car. Ken is the GOAT
It's a weird thing, every time I see something that has Ken in it, I get happy sad and tear up.  Glad he gave what he did while he was with us, and sad that he's at rest now.  But then again also happy that his family is going to carry on his legacy.  Miss ya Ken!
RIP Ken Block you touched a lot of people and you changed a lot of lives and will continue to do so from above thank you for showing us how to drive
I want to be a new KEN BLOCK
#KB4#VER  We love you ken amd we miss you!
Ken block. I grew up watching your precision of driving. Your appetite for life and your caring for those around you and I can say I am a better person for seeing it. So thank you and rest easy. KB43VER
Goosebumps. 15 years of Gymkhana. KB43ver.
Watching Ken throw the back out and Brace for Impact!  Shows the Man lived on the edge!  Thanks for always living on the Edge ken We miss you!  RIP
I’m not the only one crying at the end as soon as don’t slow down started playing right? Life isn’t fair but god I feel like we’re lucky to of gotten to experience it with Ken.
Legendary….. There will never be another. May your legacy live on throw your films. GOAT 🐐 🫡🫡🫡
Жалко Кена харошый дядька был мастер дрифта
Miss you KB43.
watching this hits so hard as he's gone now, RIP Ken Block
Still not a fan of how that thing sounds like an RC toy, so much of that fun drama is lost without the mechanical growl.  Still, Block managed to make it look spectacular with his showmanship and skill on full display.  What a legend, one that is sorely missed.
A true master of his craft. I hope your having just as much fun with the cars in heaven! 💚
Ken Block confirmed you can bugslide in real life
I miss Ken block every day, I'm still devastated, he remains the master of drifting. peace saw
RIP to Ken, you were cool as hell, and your videos always struck awe in me.
who tf said i was crying?.....cause i was 🙏🥹rip the legend
Right in the feels. RIP Ken Block.
Ken block forever ❤❤
Pretty cool that they did train crossing around the corner from my house.
I'm wondering how many tires they had to use to make this. That thing is a beast.
This guy who knows the LIMITS of the CAR and the DRIVER and ENERHITNG in motorsport ect ... * crying * ...
Unfortunately electric cars are not fun to watch even when Ken is Driving.  SORRY
Thank you for been Ken Block. You were an inspiration amongst the world and you are forever missed.
RIP Ken, its been a hell of a ride. You'll be missed
Why did electric cars have to be quiet. I want my car to sound like a warp engine on a spaceship. We need production cars with straight cut gears!
Походу это нейро сети сделали видео…
Is that the actual sound of the car? It sounds horrible. There are RC cars that sound better
Whos cutting all these onions?
No, you're crying... RIP Ken.
i see Hoonigan  wanna keep making money off of ken's dead body now.   OH RIGHT, that is how you do in marketing and not care about anything THAN $... he died in a snowmobile crash like the idiot he was... but Hoonigan  thinks " you know what we can make $$ off of this for sure"
sounds like a fighter jet haha, rest in piece the legend #43.
RIP KEN!!!
Miss you ken  Just the best .. ❤
❤
esele mi Jucs!!! jaja
<3
It was a wonderful time with you mate❤
Звук бензинового мотора никогда не заменит электромотор!
This gymkhana is so emotional, the end credit got me in tears, thanks for sharing us his last creation 💚🕊
RIP
#KB43VER
I'm not crying you are
Love you Ken Block. Best driver and car culture icon ever!!!!
❤❤❤❤
U can tell ken was afraid of that car.  Lol.  Just like anybody else would be..  crazy..  rip ken..  great vid though..
Bad ass sounds like a big rc car
This thing sounds like a cross between a race car and a spaceship, so fucking rad!  Thank you for everything Ken. ♥️ God I wish I could have met you.
One of the best racers Ive ever seen. He will be missed greatly. 43 4ever
RIP HHIC, KB43VER!
It’s definitely amazing what these E vehicles are doing, but I really miss the banging and popping and flames and revlimiter parts of these videos 😢 RIP KEN
Rip Ken you were a legend and will be missed hoonigan please re upload all of the gymkhana videos so we can all watch them again.
Amazing but also bitter sweet. One of the most talented drivers who lived, driving what would be his last run. Wherever he is. Hope he's doing what he loved. Laying down rubber. God speed 🙏 ❤
You will be missed Ken. You were my idol and always will be. You changed the car community and Motorsport forever and your vision made something that people loved to watch over and over. You were awesome RIP🔥🔥  #KB43EVR
<3
#KB43VER
Wow, just wow. Really well done with this one. First we get GTA 6 and now this what a way to end the year. RIP Ken #KB43VER
R.i.p you are the g.o.a.t ❤
You will always be the GOAT Ken! We all miss you ❤
Damn he pushed that thing hard. Rip Ken, never been so emotional for the passing of someone i didnt even know.
what a great ending, had me misty eyed by the end. RIP Ken you will be forever missed!!  #kb43ever
I'm missing that engine rev to be honest.
KB43VER
On this day in 2018, Gymkhana 10 was dropped. 5 freaking years??   Hearing Scotto say, "Ready ready" made my allergies act up. 🥺 I'm so glad you had this one in the can. #kb43ver #hhic
Lo siento siempre recordaré a Ken block 43 en coches de gasolina.
todo perfecto, incluso la aparición del JUCArita
Cuando empece a ver el video, sabia que no podia faltar el buen @juca  jajaja
how many wheels they used to make this video? WOW
thanks ken!
43 we will not forget
Ken will always be the most skilled driver ever! A legend never die!
Thank you for the awesome hits 😎 emotional to watch a wonderful tribute 💫 never gone KB 🌠
I still miss  and think a lot about him.
Grande. D.E.P.
PLEASE RELEASE FULL ONBOARDING VIDEO FROM HIS VIEW PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
So good hearing kens laugh again! Thank you for everything
It’s awesome how normal he has made this seem to us long term fans. New people watching him are shitting themselves and all the Hoonigans are like, yeah he does this stuff sometimes. lol…. RIP KEN.
❤❤❤ the G.O.A.T 🕊🕊
Great send off. Strangely eerie without much of an engine sound just ghostly tire screeching. Miss Ken 😢
😢 .... slow 👏 we all miss you
dont slow down hoonigan fam.
I’ve watched Ken Block from when I was born. I’ve always watched clips twice and loved the work he did. R.I.P my favourite American Stunt and Rally driver.
R.I.P. to the most important man in motorsports.
Ken who?
I'm crying guys, thank you for showing so much passion in motorsports, Ken always present
Этот мужик делал крутые дела, с первого взгляда я не мог оторваться от видео.. каждый раз ждал новый.. твое наследие будет с нами. ❤
No more videos of this vs this. It’s bs man the past 1 year noting but those videos..
i watched gymkhana 2 in 2009 and was blown away. Then i was sucked in to that gymkhana 1 video with that amazing hawkeye Impreza. That started that whole "car control" thing for me.
R.i.p. Ken, I know you are slaying some heavenly rally times up there!
The saying is true. Legends never die
God Bless you Ken Block. One hell of a driver, a farther, a husband and a friend to all of those around you. May you rest in peace, KB43VER. ❤❤❤
RIP master, thank you.
Ken's a reminder to enjoy life as much as possible - it won't last forever. RIP
The shoes dc shoes.
Bye Ken, thanks for the epic memories. Rip
he was a modern day superman ,and the world got smaller when he left it, he made the imposable seem posable. good guy, good father and from the outside looking in an inspiration for people that dream big .
Well, this was a Rollercoaster of emotions, rest in peace king, but we need to see Lia in at least one gymkhana or electrikhana driving, both his and her soul now feel like one, specially after Lia 's hoonipegasus pikes peak run...
This was great! I'm glad the world and his family got on last ride with him.
Smiles and tears of joy watching this r.i.p to a legend, we miss you
2:11 gives me Batmobile vibes 👀🫠 🦇
Imitated but never equaled, Rest in Power Big Bro ! #KB43VER
Damn this one hurts. So long Ken, thanks for all the memories. We miss you down here 😔😔💚💚
This one looks like it was the most taxing on his body to drive. Hell of a flex to shut down a major airport
I love the addition of "takeovers are dumb" at the end
Ridge Racer Ken, 360 for a hard right......my man!
I love, ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇵🇹
Damn it stupid video making me want to cry while drinking a monster It's got me all messed up never wash them video with that much intensity and the only thing I wanted to do was jump to the TV pull the car over and hug the driver damn it I think I finally figured out what a woman is😂😂😂😂
Much Love xxx. Taken to soon miss Ken x
Miss you so much, Ken! Your videos are timeless and will live forever. You are the pinnacle of drift videos and what it means to be a pioneer for the sport.
Brian, when the hell are you going to make a car movie? Fast and furious is dead!!
I says you do a Ken Block Gymkhana tribute with Lia driving all the cars at HQ
Good bye mate , thank you
Nobody spins them like Ken. Godspeed brother. KB43VER
This was so hard to watch I didnt know if I should cry or smile.
Lia block should take over the gymcanna videos
ohh my gosh.. miss this guy R.I.P Ken!!!
Hoon in Peace #kb43ver
Cine 🗿🚬
A legend, We miss you Ken, <3
du warst ein toller Mensch RIP ❤🕊
there will turly never be another driver as skilled as ken block, but lets hope aspiring drivers step up to the challenge. RIP Ken Block u will always be our favourite in our hearts
An inspiration to a whole generation and a legend beyond this one. It is an privilege to have been able to follow this journey through the years. And I'm happy to know that this isn't the end because of what Ken left for us.  Thank you, Ken. #KB43VER
This is how the adventure ends, Thank you for making me dream all these years, we miss you N°43 💚🖤.  rest in peace .
perfect car control 😍😍😍
#KB43ER
THE SOUND IS AMAZING !!!!  said no one ever
Thank you Ken,you're a LEGEND!  Thank you Brian we needed this,you and Hoonigan.
KB43VER
Rest easy big fella, us down here sure to miss you.
❤❤❤
KB43VER!!!!!!
Race in Paradise, legend!
Looks like AI to me unfortunately, the edition team did too good of a job
Fly high to the sky ken 🕊️ #KB43VER #LEGENDSNEVERDIE
RIP Mr BLOCK, you are forever remembered.
Ken block still leaving us with gems from beyond the grave   #Ripken
We miss you HHIC , rest in peace jefe, leyenda👏🏻🫡 🥺#kb4ever
It all just sounds and looks like my Shark hoover malfunctioning...
What a bittersweet moment. Been hooked since Gymkhana 1, I’d go around showing everybody the video like “have you seen this guy?!” I of course don’t have a spec of talent compared to what Ken had but I started trying to replicate his moves in Forza, Dirt, GT, man…what a loss. Forever remembered as one the greats. A total badass to us and a loving father and husband by his family.
Queee no sabia que salia Juca en el video
Ken is a first cyberpunk car driver. Amazing man. RIP🙏
Legends never die. Rest In Peace, Ken
Simply the best #kb43ver
What a legend 👏 🙌 💙
Legendary
RIP Ken...thank you so much for all the joy you have given MILLIONS!!! KB43VER!!!
Keep Resting in Perfect peace my Hero #KB43VER
Soo cool the bug of juca 4:08
Rest in peace, Legend. Gone, but never forgotten.
So great to see Ken drive one last time, I know that he next installment was going to be Ken handing off to Lia just wish he was here to film it.
A true pioneer and master of his craft. He will always be missed, but his legend will never die. #KB43VER
and RIP! What a way to be remembered!
why awesome people  pass away so soon , Block 43ver
Ken Block what an absolute legend and tru nice guy done soo much for the car community and will never be forgotten so sad to see a tru legend go but Lia Block is on he way to being one of the best female drivers of all time showing that Len really does live on in her RIP Ken your legacy will live on forever……….
ALWAYS KEN BLOCK!!!❤❤
rip legend it's thanks to you that I became passionate about drifting since I was little, thank you for everything #43forever
I think this 4:40 was the DIRTIEST reverse J turn i have ever seen in my life. Rest in Peace Ken.
Incredible precision as always. RIP
Lea… be better than your dad he would want that…
Damn one of the best videos
Ken Block was the Master Blaster Drift King
#KB43VER 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️❤️❤️
KB.❤️ nice job guys. 🫡
Seeing Ken smile again...has to be the best part.
why do masters of cars always die in stupid ways? Nothing to do with cars...... never the less car heroes never die RESPECT
Ken saw streets the same way a skateboarder does. “Think we can jump or grind that?”
listening to the Millennium Falcon driving in the whole video haha
RIP
3 Star Wanted Level      R.I.P. Ken Block  #KB43VER
I think it was a beautiful ending to the (epic) story of Ken Block. Rip Legend 💜
RIP Legend ❤❤❤
We will never forget the person who brought us this incredible series…….  *Thank you for everything Ken Block*  #KB43VER
Thanks y’all. We sure do miss him don’t we….  Rip43
I hope some day we will see Lia Block do a Gymkhana video in one of her dads cars. That would be absolutely insane and cool to watch!   We miss you Ken :(
43ver in our hearts  #KB43ever
RIP. WE LOVE YOU KEN.
"[HOONIGAN] Ken Block’s Electrikhana TWO: One More Playground; Mexico City in the Audi S1 Hoonitron" the guy hasn't been gone for a year and you already tryna fkn milk it ?!  WOW ! disgraceful !
Thank you for the great time, you are a legend, rest in peace !❤❤
RIP Ken.  You are a true legend and will be an everlasting inspiration for the future generations.
RIP to a GOAT
Heartbreaking that his last films are EV crap
I'm very grateful for Ken even though we lost him way too soon. He always showed the positive side of Mexico and its people. God rest your soul.
🔥🔥🔥
Guy is just an absolute legend and a unicorn wrapped into one! I still can't believe there won't be anymore gymkahanas or Electra and I do it every time....I say man I can't wait until the next....awww man🤦. It's just that natural thing of wanting something you're used to seeing every year and still just hasn't hit like I know it has for you guys who were close to him. I do know one thing, I have a feeling that his daughter and being taught the trade by KB at a young age and how she drives now and handles horsepower, she might be the next one to step up and yeah there's a lot of other great drivers out there.....but this is KB flesh and blood and makes it that much better! 🤙🙏 Thank you KB and all those behind the scenes all these years and Hoonigan crew, monster....everyone that made all these possible over the years. Thank you 🤙🙏
Well this was an emotional rollercoaster😫.
As exciting as this is it is equally as depressing knowing we will never get another Gymkhana by Ken again. RIP 43VER! 🙏❤
Ken Block & Rob Dyrdek --- Loved seeing those clips from Gymkhana 2.1...Such a great collab.
4:50 UFFF 🔥🔥
Thank you Ken for inspiring me even further to not give up on my biggest passion which was always about cars ever since I was born, lots of ups and downs but with you the downs never mattered, I just booted up Hoonigan with you as the main character and I always smiled from ear to ear on a rainy evening after long day at the school, you have a special place in my heart and it sure is permanent, so see you at the finish line, brother! #KB43VER !!! 💖✨
It mustve been incredibly painful getting this one out. Great work Hoonigan. Thank you Ken, you legend.
Oh how I wish Ken's last khana wasn't in a friggin slot car.  Couldn't even finish watching it with that incessant howling.
This was such an emotional roller coaster. I'm glad I was able to see one last ride.  RIP Ken Block
Words will never be enough... Just thank you Ken 🙏🙏 KB43VER
fucking legend, RIP
It's a poignant twist of fate that the king of drift, who mastered the art of sliding on tarmac with unrivaled grace, met his untimely end on the most slippery of all surfaces. RIP Ken. See you around the block!
#kb43ver
Torquetastic performance! We miss you Bro! Legend!
We all miss you, Ken Block. Your legacy will live on for eternity. ❤ #43
#KB43VER

Such an amazing tribute to Ken. I grew up watching and following Ken’s life a long time ago. I still forgot at times that he is gone and then i remember what a legend to motor vehicles and just Hoon style driving.  He always had a good message to spread with everyone and be a great example of you can do anything you put your mind to. We will miss you brother.
Definitely miss his driving. I hope his minion takes his place.
im so sorry i cant watch this . crying i do i cant watch this

He has been such an influential person in the car community and just the over all sport of everything this adventure loving human is involved in. We love you Ken and miss you

ебучий пылесос какой то. F
Rest in Peace ♥
Легенда!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
R.I.P Ken Block #KB43VER ❤
RIP LEGEND! Went out like an absolute boss.
I know I should be happy about this video. But unfortunately it makes me very sad. Nevertheless, many thanks to everyone who made it available. legends never die
this is so sad, first because Ken was a legend, second because its eletric
Ugh… I’m not crying! you’re crying! You and the team have brought me Joy since my early teens and now into my 30s. We will forever miss you Ken!  #KB43VER
May he rest in peace amen
R.I.P Ken! ❤

Thanks Ken. Buniut god.
Wow still sad. RIP got goosebumps
Rip KB 🙏🏻
Definitely needed a ken video 😢
Покойся с миром Кен .... Будет не хватать твоего драйва.... Best of The Best... Ken Block...😢😢😢
RIP legend
Can’t wait for the next video with Ken Block! So excited to see him get old and do crazy stunts
Tearing up even clicking on this one... gonna be a tough one...thank you Ken for always just being Ken and being the inspiration to millions through this youtube video series about cars not going straight.   One last ride. #KB43VER
RIP You legend #KB43VER
Its missing the engine sound. It really is NOT the same witouth it.
amazing as always but its just not the same knowing hes gone 😢
RIP one of the best Driver in my Life how dirves Quer and Drift so hard :D i liked all Gymkhana Vids great moments !
The abuse that car was built to take! And the skill of Ken as a driver. I’m so glad I got to see him drive at GoodWood FOS. I love every video you’ve released ❤️
Legends live on forever. The car is not as exciting to me as a gas-powered vehicle, but ken makes up for it.
Starting at 3:03, is what I'd like to call the Inception Drift (drift/donuts within a drift). Stunning stunt, indeed. He was always innovative and I will surely miss what could have been had he survived that tragic accident. 😢
4:07
❤❤❤❤❤
Rip
The shot at 4:20 where Ken braces for an impact is so sick! #KB43
☁️☁️☁️ 🛞 miss you big brother, rest on ...... Forty three.
Glad to see him smiling again! ...curious as to how many battery charges it took to make this shoot happen. ...also 2nd time I have seen an EV with a transmission/gears..?
It was an honor boys! Rip
Videos like this require YouTube to have a Love option, as Like just does not get it done. That outro compilation is beautiful.
Thank you ken for everything u did all over the world. Thank you kens family for allowing these videos to be watched worldwide. Thank you Hoonigan for everything also. Rip ken block gone but never forgotten.
Thank you for this. May kenny boys spirit live on forever.
Just absolutely awesome!  As none other could…but Lia will.  Can’t wait to see what level she takes it to!  #KB43VER 🙏🏼
Rest in peace the goat. I'll always miss him
On this episode of how many cameras can Ken Block break 😂 seriously though RIP to an absolute legend that’s impacted the racing scene hand and hand with Hoonigan and other legends like Travis Pastrana. Everyone misses you Ken we all wish you were still here or give us more Gymkhana and more memories.
The Batmobile
Glad he's gone. One less hype beast moron cutting up classic cars. Simps can go cry in their monster cans
AIFA airport closed for this? Amazing! AwesomeKen
Ken Block, a legend. One of the best drivers in the world no doubt, I watched Ken since he got rookie of the year at the rally championship. That must have been 15 years ago maybe more, since then I knew he was going to be great. I followed him ever since. Following Ken for 15 years or more and I can’t remember a single instance where he wasn’t an absolute stand up guy. I’ve never heard a bad thing about him. It’s rare to have such talent and be so humble and kind. On top of being one of the best drivers of our era and possibly ever , he was also a great husband and dad. I’m so thankful I got to follow him and watch everything he did, but so sad that it didn’t last longer and I never had the chance to meet him in real life. Rest in peace I know when we get to heaven you’ll be up there in a car doing donuts! KB4EVER
rest in peace legend, your the best
Amazing work as always.  KB43ver ❤rip icon
Was and is a legend that brought smiles to millions we're with you if decide to continue where Ken left off.
Block this channel I don't want to watch😮😢
What an amazing tribute at the end!
Wonderful photographic work. The plane before the airport shots looks too cgi but other than that, beautiful work.
What an icon to Motorsport history, it’s truly sad to see him go out like that, but his accomplishments will always remain for those to see. Kb43ver legend, icon, and most importantly a hoonigan.
Rip ken you left a massive legacy behind
Milk him like you do, now milk his Daughter
For me, this was probably the hardest one to watch knowing it was his last, RIP to the legend Ken block, always here and never forgotten ❤❤
Well damn
Not good too see you wipe his past and use him for revenue!  And what's with his Daughter being advanced to same level! 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢sad sad sad sad
Got to be one of the best put together video for the last one, forever the greatest Ken ❤
it looks cool but those EV's are so boring ! would be much better if it was a motorized vehicle ! it got no emotion
RIP the GOAT. Always in our hearts
We miss you Ken inspiration to many, an icon to the car community
This is literally me freeroaming for 6 hours a day in Forza Horizon

This one was tough to watch

I miss you Ken Block 😢 I love watching your videos on your channel ❤ RIP Legend
The best to ever do it  Love u and will always miss u
Hit me right as the compilation was playing that this is the last Gymkhana. Ken provided some amazing spectacles throughout all of his drifting. I still can't believe he's gone
Cheers!! To the man who forever changed the game!! You will forever be missed, and never forgotten as truly one of the best. This world got alot dimmer without your light. Your smile, and laughter will always and forever be missed. We love you, and miss you always!! KB 43VER!!!! SLAY ALL TIRES!!!!!
For the longest time I thought the big, loud, fire breathing cars y'all built were one of the most captivating aspects of these videos, but now seeing it done with an EV that I have no interest in and still getting those same butterflies, I realize that it was all Ken the whole time.  He is truly the greatest to ever do it.  RIP
Ken, thank you for everything. You will be deeply missed ❤
RIP Maestro 😭
Rest in peace Ken, rest in peace.
Best end credits I have ever seen. RIP to the absolute GOAT we call Ken Block. He was an abosule motorsports legend and so much more.
#kb43ver❤️🔥
Any time I hear anything involving Mexico, I always hear it in Zach's voice. Awesome work on putting this one together. You can tell the Hoonitron was a handful based on the faces Ken would make in this one. Thanks, folks.  RIP Ken, you bloody legend. 🤙🏽
🔥⚡️👊
What a freakin legend! you have changed MotoSports forever! Hope you are Gymkhana-ing up their rest easy you Hoonigan!

Thank you Hoonigan for releasing this. Its almost like the man is still with us today. #kb43ver
It's just not the same, electric cars
Rest in peace that Audi is so cool even for an EV it’s so cool 😢 I will miss this very much!
Do not Insult memory of Audi S1 Quattro
Rest in peace. You'll always be a legend for so many! Your daughter is incredibly proud to call you her father.
i am a very strong believer have having 1 episode recorded ahead just incase of passing, you would be amazed at how just editing can strike a different cord and the same exciting content can become somber
Ken Block will Always be A HooniGod!!!! #KB43ver
Beautiful 👏 👏 👏
Awesome driving, I miss Ken and also sound of petrol powered cars but still it is so good to see last gymkhana. R.I.P. legend. #KB43VER
Ken Block was probably the only person who could make me like an electric car
I literally have chills 😢 right now, overwhelmed with emotions R.I.P brother ❤
Always in our minds, and especially in our hearts.🫡🫡
Can’t wait for another series on them making this video. How many tires did Ken burn through in that monster, how much time was spent waiting for it to charge and what shit did he hit?   Amazing driving and an excellent video
Can’t wait to see his next one
Kb43 4 ever his crazy will be miss so humble
A legend lost but never forgotten.
I’m not ready for this to be the last. I’ve been into motorsports since I was a child and have watched Ken from the beginning and he was always my favourite. The world is a crapper place without him in it. Miss you Ken ❤
I grew up watching this legend, I remember everyone of the clips being launched and me running to show my friends. Thank you legend, my childhood was better because of you. RIP Ken.
Я ипал ваг группу. КЕН БЛОКК ВЕЛИЧАЙШИЙ. ВЫ РЕШИЛИ ЕГО ЗАМЕНИТЬ?
Thank you ken block
It's crazy, it's been almost a year already, RIP KB43
And keep burning those tires, Ken! Thanks! 🫡🕊
Greatest of all time 🙏
A thousand likes to the best that ever did it! KB4EVER!
KB43VER
Gonna miss these
@4:20 what the actual fuck
A man that has touched, influenced and driven such a positive force into the world and will never ever be forgotten, thank you Hoonigan.   Thank you Ken  #KB43VER
The man, the myth, the legend. Petrolheads around the world salute you. R.I.P. a Tyre god
One last drive. Thank you Sir for what you did all these years. Brought smile to milions ❤
internate made for
❤️‍🔥💐
This is to hoping Lia gets to make her own gymkhana
Seems so surreal seeing him again. What a legend the one and only Ken Block. Thank you Hoonigan and Ken for sharing one last memory with us.
The legend never die, thank you for all Ken ❤ KB43VER ❤
Amazing driver and person. Wish I got to meet him.
What an absolute legend, he will always be remembered❤. Thank you for blessing us with amazing Videos over the years❤. #KB43VER
I'm so glad there was more 🥲
it's so cool that ken left us with 1 more drift session to ease our pain
RIP🥀
Rip to the legend of Ken block. Growing up I watched him and wore his shoes and all that. To see what he's dome for the motorsports in its entirety is a legacy that will be unmatched for centuries I think. This man left everything on the line and nothing to give more. And brought alot of us into the world of motorsports. You will always have a place in our hearts Ken. Never to be forgotten
“Thank you” isn’t enough but it’s the only phrase that can put emotion into words.   You inspired so, so, SO many people to chase their dreams and goals. I wouldn’t be where I’m at today in my career if I never stumbled across climbkhana. You inspired countless people and I’m lucky enough to be one of them. You may be physically gone hooning around in heaven, but your influence is still very much alive.   Thank you for everything, Ken.  #KB43EVER🕊️
legend
You will never be forgotten, Legend!
For ever legend ! KB43VR
As much as i hate electric vehicles this made me smile
Ay papa fernando vocho
An insane car and an empty city. I didn’t think the dream I thought of occasionally could be from this series. Freedom like this is unreal to me.
There is so much I cant express, but what I can say is thank you Ken
I definitely cried at the end
U are Amazing Ken Block ♥♥
RIP Legend, thanks for inspiring us and everyone in this comment section
Cool video but its just not the same without a screaming V8
Thank you Ken for everything you’ve done for and in motorsport, you will be forever missed. and hopefully Lia will continue on his legacy! Rest in peace legend #kb43ver!
You guys keep out doing yourselves! I was in utter awe of some of the static camera shots. Amazing work!  #KB43VER
That right there... is a stunning looking car!  Awesome video. Well played all involved!
Man Ken you will be missed forever you are the greatest of all time
electric what
#KB43VER <3
It's like a giant RC car! 😆
❤
Will always be a legend of the sport ❤
Ken Block y Hoonigan apoyando la 4T con ese ft. del AIFA que barbaridad
RIP legend!
Я ни на что не намекаю, но как только он связался с электрокарами, произошло то что произошло... Ненавижу электрокары, а после смерти Кена, так ваще отвращение они вызывают Только бензин, только дизель. Пошла в задницу зеленая повестка
My cars going to get thrashed on the way to work tomorrow!
asked for it, just like irwin.... i don't feel bad at all
You will be forever missed and known ass one if not the greatest drivers alive. You brought so many people to the car community (including me way back). Rest in peace #KB43VER
R.i.p to the goat of drifting my next build is going to be in your name
THANK YOU Hoonigen crew the world needed this much love and respect from New Zealand... KEN BLOCK 43VER
rip Ken :(
RIP HOONIGAN
Grazie mille Ken, per averci fatto fatto emozionare e divertire. Ci mancherai molto. ❤️❤️❤️
The good are always taken too soon... KB43ver!
Why I wanted to see this so badly but now I’m crying
The last dance, thank you KEN!! #KB43VER
❤❤❤❤❤
There will never be another Ken that’s a given. He was special and has definitely left his mark in history in so many different ways but I love these videos so much and I think if he could be here to give his opinion I definitely think his daughter or Travis pastrana could definitely get his approval to carry the torch for the future unless it’s better to end gymkhana now and let it be his legacy and if they were to come make something similar maybe it shouldn’t be called GK. I’m very torn on what should happen from here but definitely glad I was here to see what he did his entire life but mainly these years when he got big with hoonigan because I saw him as hoonigan he embodied the exact thing it stood for and it’s so sad that we won’t get to see him grow old like other legends but he still left a great legacy and his daughter will hopefully do things in his honor I think that’d be awesome.#KB43VR
It still doesn't feel real...
So difficult to watch knowing the tragedy that lies ahead. Thank you Ken and the whole Block family. You changed so many lives with pure joy.
I was this fast and The on The Film.Yes
hoon
I'm crying.... We will never forget you, Ken, and what you did for all of us. We love you, our hero #KB43VER Also thank's to team HOONIGAN for everything. The Crew Motorfest updathe with your season is just on time
Thank you ❤ #KB43VER
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Beautiful
R.I.P. KB 43ver!🖤
God dammit! Who TF is chopping onions around here! 😭 Chills from the outset and throughout. Ending in tears. Many of us, myself included idolised this man! The definition of legend, cool and badass! Get the dictionary corrected! His name should be under all three of those! 😆
It's still unbelievable
#KB43VER
❤️
What a legend! Epic video
That hit right in the feels. #Kb43ever
Hell of a ride that was man. This guy changed my lifex my hobby, my life choises. He got me into cars and because of him i want to become a car engineer. #KB43ver
Gracias por existir, Ken.
I love how some shots are take one! And others are take “a whole lot more” 🤓 what an absolute legend ❤️
One of my heroes❤❤  #KB43VER
Everone Have this respect/This is so fine
Thank you Ken for all the years you showed the world what can be accomplished in a car.     If you not scared you’re not going fast enough.  Will live with me for ever
Kind of dusty in here.
It's crazy long time. I remember when my co worker introduced me to the first Gymkhana it was unbelievable car control that I witnessed and enjoyed 15 years. Now sadly It took an end, but i keep smiling I've got your massage Legend suck it all in and bring it to a higher level. it was a hell of a ride thanks. RIP Kenneth P. Block
Mad driving skills, but still preferred the screaming, popping 2.3LT turbo 4 cylinder..also thought that ese in the VW would pull a Tac 9 and bust a few caps off..
I’m so happy we got one final project from Ken before he passed, devastated that this will be the last gymkana I’ll see from him though😔.  His legacy as one of, if not the greatest driver in history will never disappear. We miss you ken #kb43ver💚
The way he knew where the camera was an when he hit it 😅😢
We miss you Ken, you sparked the love for cars & speed for me & for generations to come, hope you & Paul are doing brodies up in heaven ❤️
Gone too soon. A man with humongous balls and epic talent. RIP legend. The capture at 09:23 is so beautiful. Cherish the moments when they last.
Race In Peace❤ KB43VER 🔥🔥🔥🔥

I gotta admit i still can't believe he's actually gone, i feel like someday I'll just wake up and he posts that it was just a prank ...
RIP BOSS <3
#KB43VER 🤘🤙
Thank you Ken, legit started crying while watchig it, One hell of a driver, One hell of a dude. Rest easy and peacefully Ken. THANK YOU!
очень жаль что ушел. в России его тоже уважали.
Will forever miss you Ken!
Thank You!
Grande Ken Block. Gracias por todo. D.E.P
Rest in Peace Ken.. my you be hooning forever #KB43VER
There will never be another driver or hero like Ken Block!! May his inspiration and memory live forever 💚
Rest in peace Ken. You have left a huge impact in all our hearts. We love you like we knew you, even though we never met you. You left us early, but you left us with many great memories of you. God bless his soul, and the friends and family. Thank you Hoonigan crew for releasing this. We all miss him.
Other then the obvious driving,is the fact that they shut down part of an international airport.
It is still so hard to believe that Ken Block is no longer with us.. I grew up watching his awesome videos, and now it's the last hurrah.. #KB43 forever
It hasnt been the same since January😫😫😫
I will only own a etron if I’m getting an electric car actually only this etron
Ken was built different! #KB43VER
The silence of this film was honestly kinda eerie almost like him driving in purgatory or something. Definitely an end to an era, we still have pastrana though.. maybe the void can be filled
It hurts more because he died on my birthday 😣
In our hearts and our memories 43ver <3
the montage at the end got me tearing up pretty badly.  So wrong to lose a legend like this that carried such a kind spirit as well.
43ver dans nos mémoires ❤
Thx Ken for everything !
We going to miss you buddy.
Only the great mr block could dohnut while dohnuting, we all miss you so much
Incredible driver gone way too soon.
Rip ken
Most boring video, just tire noices.. impressive work tho clean drifts.. and ken would never drive an electric car...
Never thought I'd cry watching one of these... but here we are... Thank you for everything Ken❤️
in a perfect world, the last gymkhana would have been in the Hoonicorn      although in a perfect world Ken would also still be alive   o7
Ken will forever be a legend.
So happy to see one more video from Ken!! And verry proud it took place in my city 🥰 Thank you Ken Block for all you did, changing the car scene while having fun with your friends We will remember you for ever!!!
watching this, especially the ending... was super emotional. Ken did so much for me and the automotive world. I got into so many things because of his first video ever...
Cet homme c'est une légende il danse avec ces voitures c'est magnifique de toute beauté 👍🏽✌🏽🏴‍☠️
hey guys! amazing job you've done, amazing way to remember ken. but it'd be cool if you delete the scene that says "and what would be ken's last gymkhana film" 0:50  because i don't think that anyone who doesn't know ken will watch the video, and all of us know that this has been his last gymkhana, plus, it would take out the 'sad' factor from the gymkhana
Bro came back from the dead to give this fire on us 🔥
A legend!!
🙏🙏🙏🙏 RIP Ken Block we all miss you
Wow man right on time! I needed some motivation!! Let's Goooooo!
Rest easy to the legend we will never forget!  #KB43EVER
RIP
Grande Ken Block ❤🔥
We love you Ken
Drift the cosmos Ken, we miss you.
Que bueno juca en este video
Thank you all & 4 all! #KB43ver! And thank you for your Work in The Crew Motorfest! The Evo with the #KB43ver Plate brought tears in my eyes! Long live the Hoonigans and never forgett the one and only Mr.Block! <3 R.I.P (Race in Peace)
What a legend!  RIP KB
I hope that we one day get to see his daughter carry on with this.
made me sad
The hardest khana film to watch a true legend. These videos will never die neither will his legacy
The man the legend! RIP ken ❤️❤️ Thanks everyone at Hoonigan for all the hard work over the years and a huge thanks for this insane last ride! Absolutely awesome 🙌
All that needs to be said is Thank you Ken #43
Respect to one of the greatest. But man are electric cars boring. Without the pops burbles and turbo noises it really isn’t the same.
I’m not sure if we’re truly appreciating this man’s level of skill and ability to adapt. Other drivers can do some great gymkhana vids and moves but eletrikhana is nuts. Drive a fully electric car after a gas car and you’ll notice how your daily driving habits change because of the power delivery, then think of those driving habit changes and multiply them by x1000 for this level of driving.
I wonder what % of the proceeds of this video goes to Ken blocks family
thank you for the memories in making my car passion much more from the start...RIP legend you will be missed by the world,but your legacy will never die
RIP Ken. These videos just don't have the same impact when the car sounds like a vacuum cleaner though.
thanks for everything
Forever Ken block rip man 🖤
Потрясающее  🎥 Кен был крутым гонщиком! 😢
R.I.P legend. No one will ever replace your shoes in our lifes. From the days of D.C to Rally. We love you.

Those credits were enough to make a grown man cry
Almost makes it feel like he's still here... miss you Ken. The first person that really got me into cars with Paul Walker... both gone far too soon..

So sick! Rest in piece to the one and only, Ken Block!

Спасибо за детство легенда, для номер 43 навсегда уже не просто число...🔝🏅
Thank you Ken, thank you [HOONIGAN] ... for everything you've done for motorsport, for petrol heads around the world,  and for inspiring every single one of us who watch your videos over and over again. This video was incredible!
Very impressive a lot of power😮 but electric car sound made me sad😢
😇legend
In our hearts forever!
I know we don't know each other personally, Ken, but I know you and have enjoyed every single one of 'your' videos to the last second. Therefore, I want to thank you for all the great memories. Even in videos where you weren't putting on an extreme show like in JP's video, you were always someone enjoyable to watch and listen to. I will miss (the videos with) you!  Rest in peace, Ken, rest in peace 🖤
#KB43VER
With no disrespect to Ken Block but this one didn't quite feel/sound the same 😥 but I wish we could recharge Ken's batteries and bring him back 👍
Ken may be gone but he gave the last run absolutely hell for us. He will forever be a part of us that he inspired to drive just a little harder.
♥♥♥
It feels like you never left us, legend.  Rest in Power(slide), Chief. Greatly missed.
Царство тебе небесное! Ты был лучший в этом деле!!! Покойся с морм
Thanks for leaving us one last ride KB. Long live the legend!
Electric = LGBT
Que maravilla este hombre dejo un legado para siempre como disfrutaba lo que hacía cada derrape cada curva un verdadero fuera de serie
I've started doing khanas with 1/18 scale radio control 4x4 rally cars, and it's just like this but without the tyre smoke. RIP Ken Block
You inspired a young generation of drifters. We love and miss you Ken.
🔥
RIP Ken such a legend loved the montage at the end! The ev will never sound as good as petrol though ❤
Damn i forgot about the gymkhana with rob and the mini car.
RIP
Thank you for bringing more of what ken was amazing doing it and giving to us just missed
Gone to soon, rest in peace Ken. 💔
💯Legend ❤ RIP🙏🏼
RIP ken ❤
Nunca te olvidaremos Kent, siempre en nuestro recuerdo :)
RIP Driver 👍🏻
I was smh “no” during the whole video!!
Something about the silence but you know the speed is there . He was really driving that thing 🏁
Thanks for everything legend <3 Keep hooning where you are #KB43
Ken was a master at his craft definitely missed
4:20 ha, thats the ultimate definition of "please dont hit it!".
No music was 100% the right call. RIP KB43
The end of an era, and with every door that closes a new one opens. Bring on Lia block Electrikahna 3
o7
This dude was nice as hell rip brother I'ma miss these videos
Motorsport Lost a Legend, we lost an icon but his inspiration in our generation will never wear out because you tought us that only tires wear out, no memories and especially not our passion for fun. I appreciate all the moments i saw you live at gymkhana Athens Marathon Greece, all the gymkhana episodes and of cours your rally career. Burn some tyres for us in heaven, you will always be in our hearts 43!
Rip Ken. The lack of sound  is just not there. The driving is by far crazier the ever but. It’s the sound that doesn’t make sense
Thanks for everything Ken!
Rest in peace bud
id be lying if i said i wasn't tearing up watching this  #KB43VER
D.E.P Ken , thanks for your presents
O melhor de sempre
RiP
This can’t be real life
One final ride, Rest easy Ken you will live on 43ver.
That was the perfect send off
Sound of the car is so annoying :(
I truly have been inspired by Ken "king of floor it" Block ever since 2010, from Subaru to Audi, his legacy won't ever cease bc of his inspiration to all of us and all the souls he light up.
God said we had to recharge the car 500 times for the video ^^
Почти год прошёл после трагедии, а он всё ещё радует нас своим мастерством
One last time 🥺🥺👊🏻🫶🏻
😂 what a legend, not even sad anymore this really was perfect timing to release the video 👏  that man had the time of his life ! Thanks to the cre, his family for letting this be released and of course the main man! May you keep shredding tyres to bits up there dude 😄
The only person capable of making an electric car cool. RIP, legend.
Thank you for everything Ken, you been an inspiration for me and millions other people around the world. You will always be rememberd. R.I.P #KB43VER <3
Rip legend.I will remember you from the first gymkhana with Scoobie. Respect from Greece.
❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you ken, We will all miss ya man. Youre a big reason I want to rally race and just enjoy life
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
никогда не понимал прикол этих видосов вроде стрит дрифт а вроде и нет а тут особо даже перекладок не увидел , просто пятаков накрутил и в дуги позаезжал у нас царь с кабой в разы лучше исполнили в питере
I heard those tires are pressing charges
Ken to był gość, był najlepszy , który umiał bawić się motorsportem i umiał naprawdę jeżdzić , szacunek dla Niego i niech spoczywa w pokoju
ABSOLUTE LEGEND

Thing sounds like an X-Wing, I love it.  Also, tires aren't gonna last long on that thing.  Also also, RIP Ken.  edit - at times more like a jedi speeder bike

How much tyres do we need? -all! Hail to Ken!
Awesome! Need to go back and watch all the old ones!👌🏻
Awesome! Need to go back and watch all the old ones!👌🏻
Ken was one dude that was on my bucket list to meet. What an all around stud! I’m grateful that we have these vids to remind us of how phenomenal he was.
It felt like he was still alive while watching this😢
❤
I love it. It does sound like a RC car next to the other gymkhana videos. But Ken is and always will be a legend. I hope Lia will carry on with what he started.
Thanks Ken Block ❤😍
Rifting in Peace #KB43VER
QUESTION: How many sets of tires have you guys gone through? This car looks like it's especially tire hungry monster🤔
LONGLIVE THE LEGEND
RIP to the legand
Man what a dream he got to live while he was with us, what car guy hasn’t wanted a whole city to themselves to just tear shit up. He has made his on style of Motorsport with gymghana then he get to go do it in multiple city’s. How kick ass.
That’s a big ass RC car!
The GOAT
Will definitely be missed...  #KB43ver
bro good at driving
We miss you big dog thanks for all the great memories
Man it would’ve been awesome to see one last ride in the hoonicorn
Man I wasn't ready for the end of the Khanas through the years. 💔
Incredible driving skill #KB43RIP
That thing is WILD!
Masters at work. From the Cameramen, to the Directors, to the Coordinators, the Engineers, to Ken himself and to all the people that worked on one of these films. All of them working together to create masterpieces of automotive cinema that I'm proud to have lived through and witnessed. Thank you for everything! #KB43VER
To the man who lit the spark inside of me to start sim racing, drifting and rally, thank you for everything you will be missed
Damn, how can we say this is the last, that hits deep. RIP Ken!
How do you feel that the Hoonitron is now an official Lego set?
Amazing way to say goodbye 😢
Писк электромотора скучен и ужасен...
Well I didn't need to tear up before work but it was a blessing to see the best motorsports driver in the world one last time, the scene will never be the same
This might be the only electric car sound I actually love . Miss you Ken...
So thankful for the 15 years of fun we had with Ken. Thank you KB and Hoonigan for bringing endless smiles to our faces ❤
An absolute legend and icon. KB 43ver
Such an incredible video
Thank you for all the memories Ken.
“Ken wouldn’t of appreciated a moment of silence for himself, he’s more of a moment of violence type of guy”
Thank you Ken. Absolute Legend. ❤
R.i.P Legend❤
🥲I’m not crying you are. Thank you Ken Forgiving us this masterpiece series you and scotto came up with you will forever be missed
Can I race for the hoonigan race team? I'm damn good, lost my livelihood and have nothing left to live for so why can't I live life the way I want? Why do I have to be stuck with all these shit jobs?
❤❤❤
#LL43KB
Its a shame the last gymkanah was in an electric piece of shit😞
The man who brought 1M views to cars on YouTube. Thank you Ken🙏❤
Love you Hoonigan, Love you Ken, since I was 15 Ken influenced me to shred, I've almost always had his Gymkhana cars as the background on my phone.  If you could make a list of never been done in a car Ken has probly checked that.  Countless hours of joy. KB43ver
Ken, the team at Hoonigan, and everyone involved.  Thank you for destroying four more tires, probably a bunch of cones, a couple unfortunate cameras, but most of all thank you for one last hooray at having an absolute blast at a new play ground. Thank you. you've captured moments that people can only dream of, about one of, if not the, greatest driver we have seen this modern era.  Keep sending it!
❤
ken wouldnt stand his machines coming electric, so he gave up
KB43VER 💔💔💔
Ken. I Loved watching what you did. So entertaining watching you sliding them awesome cars all over the place. You’re gone but not forgotten. RIP Legend
Rip legend
Hoonigan and Ken, y'all rock! RIP Ken. Peace
Damn who's cutting onions in here. Thank you Ken. And thank you, Hoonigan for giving us this one last ride with ken.

Rest in peace Ken. You will be missed. #KB43VER
Great video R.I.P Ken you are missed
RIP Ken.
slide in peace
GOAT
Anybody else just sitting in quiet contemplation after watching, and realizing that THIS is the last time we'll see a new Gymkhana film with Ken driving? Hitting me kind of hard at the moment.
All I can say is thank you, Ken.
Man I miss him. Thanks for everything Ken.
Front spinning back and back spinning forward holycrap
Say no more ... a true legend ❤🙏
K43 RIP❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lo disfrute mucho pero con lagrimas en los ojos que grande Ken siempre te recordaremos

B R I V I D I Grazie di tutto KB43❤
That face at 4:20 lmao - "I'm gonna hit 😬🫣 "
I always waited for Ken to drop these videos everytime 😢 his best work from him and the team. Damn man RIP 🕊️ to a legend 🤴🏼
Love that you guys released this, but please just let him rest now
Can’t explain how much I loved the end of this video. So many great memories over the years. Thank you Ken for sharing your world with all of us!
Everyone in North America should see Mexico like this, from this perspective, this is the real way and not in the classic sepia filter that they usually use in all their films to refer to the fact that they are located in Mexico, btw we will miss Ken and his way so crazy to drive. #KB43VER
Been real hoonigan but I content has gone down the shitter loved what it use to be but like all sell-outS it turns to shit eventually. RIPKEN.
Miss you Ken rest easy ❤
Putain la saveur et perdue ....on dirai une voiture téléguidé
Race in Paradise Ken Block
Крутой был чувак😢
It still hurts. This guy had the greatest personality.
💚☝️KB43
If Ken Block is closing his eyes and bracing for impact…You are 100% without a doubt at Full Send…..RIPKB43.
Struggling to find the words for this. All I can say is thank you Ken for inspiring the car community as a whole, and showing us what a true badass is. You will be greatly missed but your legacy will live on for many years to come❤️ "Go fast, Risk everything" #KB43VER
#KB43VER - Legendary
Ken You will be 43ver and 43ver missed! #KB43VER❤
Rest in peace sweet prince!

We miss you Ken
One last ride.
We love you KB❤
LEGEND 🔥🔥🔥 #KB43VER
An icon that will be missed globally. I remember sharing the first scooby video way back in 2008 with family and friends saying this is bonkers driving.   #43ver
A man, a myth, THE legend. RIP 43.
One of my all time sports heroes. Thanks for doing all that you did   ❤
Someday I will see Ken without insant tears in my eyes. Today is not that day.
we need a doc on this please   #KB43VER
We got one last show.  For poeple like me Ken was a hero and inspiration.  Been a fan since day one.  Wear a hoon hat and belt everyday.  Shirt on most.   Im probably one of the older fans but for sure a die hard.  Ken ans scotto put a name to my life!   There is no replacment.  But maybe rob D can rethink retiring from stunts for us.  Thx Ken.  KB43ver
this made me want to drive my rc car, then suddenly made me very sad
The best
Ken will always be the only reason I ever enjoyed watching this channel. RIP
πολύ ωραίο βίντεο ξεχωριστos πιλότος η λία έχει την ευθύνη και τη χαρά να ξαναφέρει τον πατέρα της να συνεχίσει αυτά που άρχισε δεν τελειώσανε και άλλα πολλά καλή συνέχεια και καλή υπομονή στο έργο σου αλλά είσαι σκληρο καρύδι όπως ο μπαμπάς σου καλή συνέχεια και καλές γιορτές να προσέχεις Λια δεν είναι για να χάνουμε κι άλλους.-
I don't even have the words other than to say thank you. Thank you Ken, thank you Hoonigan, and love and light to the Block family.
What a team of artists... Amazing! Who will step up and raise the bar the way that Ken and the Hoonigans did? and make it look easy, while also making it look so brilliant.
Thank you, Legend!
The original NA Hoonicorn was easily the best build
Ken block is not just any car legend he is the hero of the car community.  Thanks for everything ken.  #KB43VER
Ken 43VER 💫
What a fitting tribute to the legend, that is Ken Block. We will always miss you, but never forget you.❤❤❤
RIP Drift GOAT 🕊🏁
If someone would ask me what got me into cars and motorsports, one of my answers would be Ken with his breathtaking stunts, his amazing skills with rally cars and his desire to break the limits of everything with four wheels. We will never forget you, Ken. KB43ver.
Legend ❤️
fuckin aye man !! keep on shredding ken !! #kb43ver long live the goat 😇

Ken’s proximity driving will never be equalled 🥹🥹 well maybe one person. One who already started a career that is worth following with great interest 👌🏼. Thank you for everything Ken ❤️ absolute motorsport legend #KB43VER
Love that shot of his wince at 4:20. Glad to see he even surprised himself at times. Rest in peace, Ken.
Inspired me to love SUBIS and cars in general. Glad you did what you were passionate about!
ALL THESE FAKE KB FANS CRYING ABOUT DEATH. NO ONE CARES

Thank you for the oh shit! moments, the wow moments and now the tears. thank you for always being open with your processes and being yourselves. These videos ignited a love for cars that I lost over a period of time. I will be forever grateful for all of you and especially to Ken. <3 love you guys
RIP Legend #KB43VER
Ken is an absolute LEGEND!!!..😍👌..we miss you!!🙏😪this video is awesome!!...and this car that Audi has created is stunning,  the speed of this Hoonitron is astonishing!!😱.....thanks Hoonigan Team for that lovely montage of clips of Ken at the end....😢 ... so sad, but at the same time, so nice to see!..God bless you Ken.. we miss you!!!😢🙏👌
Ken was my inspiration driving I wanted to be like him We will never miss him❤️❤️❤️
Errr...RIP Ken and that...but, isn't Lewis Hamilton on Monster Energy too? Isn't he in his off season right now also?  HHHHHHMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm!  Y'all seen his Tokyo drifting session from a year or so back right?
Man KB we miss you bro. Only person in heaven scaring God himself in a drift session thru the gates. Influenced millions and I THANK YOU!! You'd be proud of Lia taking Pig up Pikes. Torch passed!!! #StaySlideways
Thank you Ken for doing what you did and giving us all a reason to pursue our dreams. And thank you Scotto for helping him capture it all and sharing with us.
This video really brought back the memories of watching hoonigan videos and recreating them in forza. Ken made such an amazing impact on so many people. He will be forever missed 🥲❤️
Legends say he is now drifting backwards up the pikes peak course in heaven!
The GOAT!  RIP
Thank you for everything good sir. 🕊  #KB43VER
Y ese vocho todo meado ¿que tenia que hacer allí?
Much love to Ken, Lucy, and the entire BlockHouse Team/Crew. 43ver!
Thank your for entertaining us all for all these years, it’s been one hell of a ride , much love 🫶🫶🫶
#KB43VER
That ending was everything man. Great great job guys. Ken would be proud ❤
Thank you Ken!
Outstanding! Only like Ken could put down! #KB43VER. This was an emotional one for me. Thank you to Scotto and the Hoonigan team for sharing this with the world!
I’m happy to be blessed with one last Ken Gymkhana thank you, I wasn’t expecting to shed any tears today. #KB43VER. Thanks Ken for all the inspiration
¡¡¡SENCILLAMENTE ALUCINANTE!!! ¡¡¡FELICITACIONES DIEGO ESPAÑA!!! LO HICISTE OTRA VEZ. Unas imágenes impactantes que rebalsan de adrenalina y un sonido que te sacude. Ni que hablar de la producción. ¡¡¡Impresionante!!!
Електрикхана памяти Кена Блока? Долб0ёбы продажные! )
That opening shot of the front and rear wheels spinning in opposite directions was super cool! And something only EVs can do... I'm so glad you guys got this in the can before it was too late. Posting it at the end of the year feels like the true send-off to a legend of car culture.
It’s just so sad that he’s gone 😞 never forgotten tho 😎
RIP Ken Block, thanks Hoonigan and all the partners for the memories!
Rest In Peace to a legend. We appreciate all that he’s done for Motorsport. ❤
The way he braces at 4:21 before he pulls off that drift haha
Awesome🎉❤
RIP legend.
Thank you, Ken❤
I still can’t believe this is the end. I’m grateful we got one more film from Ken, but I’m still gutted that there will be no more. Very happy for the success of Blockhouse Racing this year, but I’m sure they’re still grieving. Race In Peace Ken. #KB43VER
KB 43ver rip

Thank you Ken. Will never forget as a kid first watching you all those years ago thinking you were coolest guy in the world subjecting James May to an eyeball spin-dryer. You’ll forever live in all our memories. Legend
7:25 WHAT KIND OF IMMORTAL WITCHCRAFT IS THIS?!??
❤
Rest in peace Ken Block an absolute legend in motorsports🙏🏼
Almost a year later and it still doesn’t feel real
😭😭😭😭 This video brokes my heart. You will always be a legend Ken ❤
Ken Block! Ever the showman and you folks at Hoonigan never disappoint! Thank you
How TF did they get the airport to close down for this
Amazing video! Amazing driver. RIP BLOCK ❤
Thank you for everything Ken KB43VER and thanks to the Hoonigan team
We will miss your passion and energy, the joy you brought to millions.  A true hero to the everyday person.
Fucking awesome! ❤️
This made my day but also made me cry. I can only imagine how hard it was for Scotto to do this. It seems like nothing until you realize decades pass and you've known someone that long then they are ripped away. RIP KB
Juca heres grande hermano el mejor r.i.p ken ❤
We miss you, Ken. #KB43VER
ETERNAL LOVE FOR KEN, HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Rest in Peace LEGEND
Big up's to the Hoonigan family for bringing us the final installment of Gymkhana. Please release all the clips on one DVD? Cheers, what a great ride.
An Artist and HIS Medium was Asphalt.!.!. Thank You for the Miles of Smiles!!
Legends will never be forgotten... ❤Hope your shredding it up there with Colin mcrae
Keep shredding those tires ken.  RIP
Thank you, Ken. ❤
Back from the dead like rally car Jesus..... Ken Block drives again!
Ending on the airfield probably was an intentional callback to the first Gymkhana movie but no one could have predicted how much of a full circle moment it would be... That's when the tears started and then with the flashbacks montage over the credits the floodgates opened... This was equally mindblowing and heartbreaking, Ken got to seriously shine for one last time... What a high note to end on... Thank you Ken for all these crazy, wonderful moments over the years, taking me from a 7 year old kid to a full-fledged young adult, awing me time and time again with each new Gymkhana installment! Forever in our hearts #kb43ever
The end credits were awesome. Chopping onions right now.  The first couple gymkhana videos were the primary reason why I have 2 Subaru's in my driveway today! Car culture got turned on its head because of Ken and this series.
God rest his soul. Electric just ain’t it though.
KB43VER
Makes me cry just hearing his voice man I miss this man
This makes me happy & sad !
43ver #rip legend
“OMG KEN BLOCK IS DRIVING”  Until I realised 😢
I know you can watch them all for free here on YouTube  but I really do hope you guys make a complete gymkana collection on sone form of physical media like blu ray or dvd.. I would so buy it to keep in my collection.
take notes forza horizon 5 also i miss you ken block
Thank you for everything Ken for giving us inspirations and having us on the edge of our seats watching your amazing Gymkhanas ❤ RIP Ken #KB43VER

Impossible not to get emotional watching this, he made art every time he was behind the wheel, I’ll never forget the massive inspiration he was to me and many others for the love of rally and motorsports in general. Thank you Ken. We miss you.
#KB43VER
I'm not crying, you're crying. All in all thank you Brian and everyone else involved for putting this together for all of us, it had to of been tough to have the footage after Kens passing.

REST IN PEACE LEGEND <3
I miss this man so much. These videos made my teenage years,  #KB43VER
Being around to see each and every Gymkhana, actually going to San Fran to see the areas that were used in the making one of them, and always having a Gymkhana pop up on my feed filled me in every way. While I wish to se more of them, I don't know if i could. I can only think of two people who can fill that spot. I hope they find one of them to continue the tradition and hold the mantle exactly how it should be done! KB43VER
He drives with km/h like a real man.
Cheers Hoonigan for one last epic time, Ken Block... A person never to forget
Tenías tanto para dar, y nos dejaste tan repentinamente. #KB43VER
This channel just isn't what it was now that Ken is gone. Only content they have is all of Kens videos that haven't been published yet. And the ones they try to make without Ken are trash.
Thanks KEN BLOCK. You were an inspiration for all of us who like the world of motorsports. We will miss you.. #KB43VER
Never thought I’d get one last heart flutter at the sight of a new Ken block film. God bless you Ken. One of a kind. RIP
What a beautiful send off for such an amazing driver.   Also, that shot at 7:11 needs to be a poster!
This is it boys. The final goodbye to the end of an era. What era to have lived through. Everything he did felt like it shouldnt be done. Him racing, the gymkhana, the shenanigans. But he did it better than anyone, inspired a generation, and left his mark. KB43ver
#KB43VER
It reminds me of the days back in the 1980s when I powerslide and drifted in a Honda Civic ...no power from the engine but pure nerves and a lot of new tires and brake shoes. 😁
Thank you KB for giving us the gymkhana series and pushing the envelope of everything in the motorsports industry. To the rest of the Block and Hoonigan family thank you for giving us this one final ride with KB.
Thank you for being Ken
RIP in paradise Mr Block. 43ver the hooniGOAT. May you continue to shred in the great beyond until the end of time.
Ken block forever 😢
Miss you and thank you for everything, your legacy will live on #KB43VER
BLOCK FOREVER!!!!!!!
The world wasn't ready for this man to leave nor his family and friends and don't think we ever will be he was a visionary a trailblazer and more importantly a dad may his wife kids and family carry his legacy to live forever
Bro respawned
Can anyone tell me what the paddles do behind the steering wheel?
If you listen carefully on the quiet nights, you can still hear the wails from tortured tires.  I know you are making God angry up there with your eternal Gymkhana! ✌️
Kind of sad you guys are trying to make money off a dead man. Fuck you guys. RIP 43, love u Ken
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
The LEGEND
I love you Ken you had the balls to do what no one else could it will forever change my heart to know you aren’t with us physically and I hope that your family continues the legacy for millennia to come!
legend!!!! RIP BLOCK
Such a rad guy.  Forever an icon.  Missing Ken is still a gut punch. Nice work on this one, team.  Can't wait to see what happens next.
Rest easy
So awesome and sad at the same time. To bad some of the brightest candles burn out so fast.
Rip legend. Your legacy will live on ❤
I love the trail of car parts he leaves behind.  lol
mmm... xyeTa.
You will always be one of my favorite drivers ever.... the skills that you have are unreal and its so surreal that you are gone.... You will always be in our heart ♥♥♥♥
OMG.KEN its Amazing.We miss you.Remember4ever
One last gymkhana.. What a fucking legend! Thank you Ken, for all of it 💚 Rest in peace brother 🏁
Ken Block was our generation's Evel Knievel, A true American Badass that will 43ver be missed!   #KB43VER
Ken was a God! He will be missed!
4:09 juca making a cameo
That's cute. You put it on kilometers to make it look faster last time I checked, you're an American company. Use the freedom fractions
RIP to the king.  DC Shoes 43VER
I don't know how I feel about this knowing that the company he founded was bought and assimilated into some corpo stuff... This feels like a PR stunt in disguise.
Yup, I am crying. Thanks for the great memories Ken! #KB43VER
KB43VER❤🙏🏼
Ken Block - the fighter pilot of drivers - nobody will ever compare
Легенда живет вечно в наших сердцах!
Count the tire marks on the street. Almost each shot is done multiple times. They once said it's about four to six sets of tires for each day of shooting...

#KB43VER❤
Iconic 43ever
Tears for you bro.
RIP Legend❤ Thanks to the Hoonigan Team for the amazing job as usual. Will miss you Ken   #KB43VER
Ken you’ll be forever an icon and a role model god bless you very much we’ll hold the fort here
i miss him so much
Ngl there  were tears at the end of that,thank you for the pleasure you gave us Ken ,rest in peace 🙏 #kB43ever
I don't care how well they perform, electric cars have to the most underwhelming thing to happen to motorsports
❤❤grande..e grazie per ciò che ci ai dato...mancherai ❤❤
ok boomer
It's sad Ken block couldn't even make an electric car  Cool
We love you Ken! Even after he has passed, we still get to see amazing stuff from him and his team that they have held onto. Fortunately, the world has his daughter to hold up the torch of tire shredding engine screaming ART that Ken once delivered for us. Thank you Ken and best of luck to Lia for her future!
❤❤❤
Unicorn and the hunata truck was so much better
@dkapxl3463 il y a 1 minute (modifié) J'espère que tu peu glisser comme un malade la ou tu es maintenant Ken repose en paix  #kb43ver
Ken will be greatly missed, but I'm so glad we got to go on one more wild ride with him!
Bro, imagine your sidewalks being so dirty that doing donuts on them cleans them up
without engine noise its just not the same
To bad Audi didn't give him a real car to drive.
Your Missed!!!
❤
Don't slow down in heaven Ken
An inspiration to many. Influnced many. Loved by everyone besides him and watching him. You will be forever missed. Go on and Heaven-Khana with God above and drop your smoke so we will look above and knew that it was you doing your work. ❤❤💔💔
RIP to one the greatest #KB43VER <3
I discovered Ken Block with the first Gymkhana and follow him since. He change the way to promote motorsport and sport in general. He was a legend and never be missed. His legacy is in good hands with Lia.  #KB43VER
rip
San Francisco is still my fav one
So many bad ideas come from the glorious nonsense Ken (and team) came up with. You will be missed and leave a huge hole to fill.
Fucking legend
Thank you Ken, for everything. We miss and love you. Thank you Hoonigans
Ken was a true inspiration to millions and a legend among men. The world feels like a much different place without him, but he changed it for the better in so many ways while we had him. KB4EVER
A major stone in the foundation of motorsports, never forgotten
Still miss him so much. He was my hero. And he always will be ❤❤❤❤.
Ahhh pinche JUCA ! 🤙🏻
so sad hes gone
He is deeply missed.
Rest in Power 43ver
kb43ver
Thank you for all your crazy drivings, Ken Block! We will miss you
Legend
Quality content
Simplismente sensassional, incrível e inesquecivel, na memória para sempre, eterno Rei Ken Block....
If you look closely he has paddles and can select gears now if every electric car had that I’d be on board you can take the engine away but don’t take the manual transmission away Atleast that looks so fun
Absolutely amazing! Would love to see a Q&A with the boys explaining the logistics of this one, incredible work
R.I.P king
One of the greatest race car drivers of all time. Truly can never be put into words how much he will be missed <3 RIP KB
Montage at the end proves nothing beats the sounds of rev limiters, anti-lag, turbo, blow-off valves, and sheer horsepower.  ICE-4Life, I hope people wake up to the net negative that electric vehicles have on the environment, economy, infrastructure,  people mining lithium, and the world as a whole.
The best
Well done to the crew 🙏this is the best send of video possible ❤KB43VER
Absolute Beast
Miss Ken ❤ also miss engine sounds
Thanks you Ken Block 🙏🏻😇
This was majestic
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯❤❤❤
Thank you for changing the car community Ken❤
The absolute legend and complete legend of Ken Block. You will be missed. Thank you for inspiring this generation and thank you for everything you did for motorsports. I hope you are doing everything you love upstairs.
The 180 ollie to fakie out on the speed bump was crazy.
I wasn't expecting another one of these. This was awesome, and beautiful to get one more, and like many others, the ending really hit me. There will never be another Ken Block, but it's cool to know his daughter has part of his spirit in her. If anyone can step into his spot, it's her.  Thank you, Ken, for all the good memories. Rest easy.
RIP KEN BLOCK 43 😔
Who else here can truly say you miss Ken something terrible this is the reason I opened my shop the reason I used to drive bless his soul bless his family long live KB43 never will be another like him
Ken forever ❤
Thank you Ken block
At least for 11 minutes and 36 seconds, I could feel him being with us again. Thank you!
Who else thought the guy on the lift had a paintball gun!
Humble. Kind. Visionary. Always worked his best to fulfil his dreams. An inspiration for us and the future generation! We will miss you always Ken! #KB43VER ❤
Dude, if the opening to todays film didnt bring a tear to your heart you dont belong here 😢#43forever ken is the goat of al time 😂🤘🏼hoon the world.
RIP the GOAT !
:/
The man is gone, but his legacy is never going away…   #KB43VER
In tears
Such a larger than life person.  That news of his passing was devastating.  I never knew or met Ken but his videos and his personality through his videos just made him out to be that best friend you never knew you had in my opinion.  Great talent taken way too soon.  It is nice to see that his daughter is walking in his footsteps and keeping his legacy alive through her career.  There will only ever be one Ken Block.  He may be imitated but will never be replicated.  Only unless it is through his daughter.  Many thanks for posting this video Hoonigan TEAM!!! You guys Rock!!
We miss you Ken  #43ver
You will 43VER be missed KEN What a Legend RIP #KB43VER
Fucking LEGEND!!!!
Welcome back Ken!
These videos always make me smile from ear to ear! They will never get old. I had a tear in my eye watching this one though. RIP Ken Block. You are sorely missed. Your legend will live on! 🤟💔
I didn't wanna cry this morning. But here we are. R.I.P. Ken. You are a legend 💕
The Man....The Myth.... The Legend 🤘
RIP to Ken. Now, can we all agree electric isn't as exciting as a TT V8?
God speed R.I.P 43.
4.07 Juca y su vocho 🤟🏻🔥
Thanks for taking us with U to some of the most incredible rides in 4WD, in all kinds of stable, drifting or airborne Sequences, Kenny!   You did what a l l kids with toycars dream of   You'll be with us everywhere smoking tires are !💛   #KB43ver
RIP KEN!!! You inspired an entire generation to be hoonigans
Im not crying. I swear.
🩻 eternal remembrance 🌬️
Царствие небесное🙏
One of the best series ever.
God Bless. Drift in peace sir. 🏎💨
I still remember being 12 years old watching gymkhana Los Angeles back in 2014. RIP Ken. Thanks for all these great stuff through all these years
Que grande era ken block te echaremos de menos campeón un gran piloto 💪💪💪, no sabía que Júca salía en este vídeo con el bocho 🤭🤭🤭
Burn rubber not soul. Drift in peace Ken ❤
me in GTAV lobbies
I was overcome with emotions while watching the amazing legend #43KB doing his thing for one last time. I am grateful to the Hoonigan team for letting all of us witness his grand performance, and I am excited to see what his daughter Lia will do next. It feels like a real-life superhero story.
#KB43VER
💚🖤💚🖤 #KB43VER  LEGEND
THE GOAT!💪🏾❤️
Thanks for everything Ken.
Absolute LEGEND!  He will live in our hearts forever. The legacy lives on
bro that sound of that car is just awful, literally my vacuum cleaner sounds better
I wish Ken is still with us today, but I am grateful for the 15 years of inspiration, passion and insanity he and everyone behind him brought to (my) life. As an 8 year old car enthousiast stumbling upon Gymkhana Practice was THE best thing that happened to me and many more people. Legends never die. #KB43VER
The need for speed, the love for cars, and the passion for going fast and taking chances that Ken has given to all of us gearheads will never be forgotten. #KB43VER
KB43VER. We're going to miss you for eternity and them some. Rally in Paradise.
This is too damned good and so sad at the same time that it ends like this. There will never be another like you Ken <3
I hope he's still shredding up the streets somewhere in the afterlife. This was a fantastic final gift from the legend himself. #KB43VER
I didn't come across gymkhana until 2020, but it changed my life. Didn't know how a carburetor worked 4 years ago and I installed a 2-post lift in my detached garage/shop last week. Can't wait til I finish my first of many builds, with the objective of Hooning each one of them. RIP to the Legend, Ken Block.  I even had a pair of Danny Way DC Aeros as a young skater. No idea he was a part of my life since childhood.
awesome job scoto we love you ken you will always be missed by us all you were a great man with one of the greatest driving talents that i have ever seen before rest in paradise brother. #KB43VER
Cant wait 4 Lia to drive the next film.  Sad but great.
Покойся с миром, ты вошёл в историю!!! ❤
0:54 This is one hell of a anime protagonist's shot right here! We all miss you, Ken!
A FART IN A ELEVATOR IS MORE EXCITING THAN EV SHOULD HAD USED THE I5 TURBO
#KB43VER
Rip legend
hard to believe you gone...🥵
Ken Block, the man, the myth, the legend, sadly absent from our presence, but forever in our hearts and minds. Nobody could drive them like Ken did, he made it look so easy and he was always on the edge.  Much respect and admiration for the man.
All these videos would have been way better if there wasn't a million tyre marks on the road  from practicing.
Millions of awesome childhood memories. #kb43ver
Oh man, that sure does have wheel spin
☹️😢We Miss U Ken❤
You will be missed my man.... Freestyle motorsports will never be the same without you.
I've watch Ken block sense the beginning and will miss his videos forever. This video was amazing but the electric car stuff is just so boring, there's no excitement and I really wish this wasn't his last video 😭😭😭
Thank you Block family!
We miss you, Ken. #KB43VER
A huge thank you to the Hoonigan team. I can imagine how difficult it must've been to get this out so soon. It was an excellent video. Thanks again. RIP Mr Ken Block. You will be missed.
RIP to a legend :(
Ken was a legend that left behind a powerful legacy. Legends never die...........Hope your looking down on every one banging gears and swinging them rear tires
Love all that the K-Block was able to accomplish, all the people he touched, all the tires destroyed.  I'm having his quote put on my next racecar "Destroy All Tires" in memory of the master himself.  May he rest in peace but may his memory live on forever.
Can't believe this is the last time I'll get to see new KB43 content.  Thank you Hoonigan for finishing this project, I know it must have been a tough edit.
After watching this video, I can't believe that Ken has left all of us. It feels like that we will see him in another Gymkhana video🥲. #KB43VER
is he shifting gears in an electric car?
Ken 😢❤❤❤
Watching this was oddly peaceful. #KB43VER
Here's hoping Leah carries on the gymkhana torch
I’m not crying, you’re crying
#KB43VER
Rest easy champ , The future scares me
he didnt deserve to go. whyyy whyyy did he have to go!! 😭😭
Wow. I didn't know about this one. RIP Mr Block. Last signed roads by the best driver left in Mexicooooo🇲🇽 🤠➿➰🏎️💨💨🙏🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
Ah! this was amazing!! Definitely was trying to hold a tear in the whole time, then the montage at the end messed me up. #KB43VER

Hearing his voice right at the end was trippy and awesome all at the same time. Thanks for everything that you’ve added to my life and the lives of so many others!
Ken block. The best or nothing. Rip. We love you. Russia.
We Miss you Ken I hope you enjoy your much deserved retirement. Fly high 🕊🕊
Such an amazing, super talented driver, a massive loss that’s for sure. I must admit though, I struggled with this one being electric 😂
Thanks for everything Mister Block.
RIP, Ken. May we all live with passion.
Fucking amazing ❤

Круто! Но есть одно но, мерское комаринное пищание.

Such a great driver and very missed 😇
Burning tires and making donuts to the very end. Forever, you'll be missed. thanks for everything.
Legends come and go, but this one might stay forever...
4:21 , did Ken just close his eyes!
WRC should bring back group B awd electric 4:21 and this would be its opening intro
He will forever be missed man ❤❤❤
We miss you Ken. What an amazing final video
I still can't get over that you're gone Ken. Thanks for all the awesomeness that you gave us. ❤
For a second, i hoped Ken Block is back...
The legend will live on within all of our memories. ❤ Send it in peace dude!!
EL PINCHE JUCA

Rest in Peace Ken!🕊
I'm gonna go cry now
KB43ever ❤❤❤❤❤😢❤❤
Very emotional video makes me miss Ken even more! can’t imagine what a lost This was for his family🙏🙏🙏🙏😇😇😇😇.       Don’t like the electric vehicle. I miss the sound of turbo and blow off valves.😁
Nobody does it quite like Ken.  R.I.P <3
This is difficult to watch.  The look on his face when he thought he was about to hit the curb was priceless.  Blocks driving style is what attracted me most.  I cant believe this is his last one.
Bad ass.. R.I.P. Ken Block!
R.I.P. kenn ❤❤ u wil be missed
❤❤❤❤❤❤
This sounds so much cooler than some whoopie cushion And you can really tell that this thing has WAY too much power for Ken to handle. No ICE could put him to this limit!!!!
Miss You Ken!
🤘🕊❤
Historical video
#KB4EVER
Totally gutted he didn’t get to do more with Audi.
KB43VER 🤙🏼

We miss you very much Ken! Thankyou for the amazing content you and brian have put out over the years! <3
Rest easy big block
One word…….LEGEND!!!!!!!!
I teared up and started crying the second I heard his voice in this video.. ken was hands down the best. He will always be missed.
I say this with sadness but happiness all at once I’m so very thankful his daughter is following in his footsteps.
5 mins in and meh... If I wanted to listen to the dental hygienist clean my teeth for 11 mins I'd go suffer in the chair.  I love hooning and watching Ken Block but this is as lame as the original electric car bs. Hard pass.
Merci 🙏
Well that was emotional 🥺 keep on hooning ken with all the other great legends!
De polanco a Copilco y de copilco al AIFA en segundos!! Vaya el hoonitron si que es rápido!!
RIP Ken, awesome. Still, give me petrol any day of the week! 😏
We love you KB4EVR ❤

Why am I crying for someone I've never met? What an amazing man, dad, sportsman, and all around best driver. I know your smiling down on your friends, family, and daughter. Keep hoonin in the sky 🤟

Легенда , светлая память тебе !😑 Нам тебя не хватает
Rip to a real legend ❤️
#KB43VER Ken was an amazing man with many cool talents in the rally industry. When I was little I wanted to meet Ken Block and tell him he is a great car influencer to all of us fans of Hoonigan.
Goosebumps. From beginning to end. #KB43VER
Thank You 4 this and everything You made. KB43 4ever.
I grew up watching mr.block's dash/helmet cams. He got me through the worst and best of life with his carefree and accepting nature. His passing has driven me to the Motorsports career in my life and I will begin college next year. I just hope all of you at hoonigan understand how big of an influence Ken Block has been and will continue to be. I have always wanted to follow his footsteps and hopefully now I will.
That was truly amazing to watch, so sorry hes passed, but incredibly special to be able to see this and know its the finale, i was able to hold myself right up until the ending montage, those dang onions...KB43VER
this is beautiful, cannot like this enough. Miss you ken thanks for all the crazy memories 💕
R.I.P Ken Block
ken was the goat and still forever will be
LEGEND #KB43ver
Finally, after almost a year I'm able to watch him again, without getting emotional. What a legend we lost. Will we ever see the Hoonicorn again? Lia maybe? Her run up Pikes Peak was amazing.
Ken, you will be always in my heart. You are the most crazyinsanecooll driver forever ! #KB43VER
R.I.P ken we miss you !!! You are the GOAT of gymkana ,.... Peace from Belgium
Кен, спасибо тебе за детство, спасибо что подарил любовь к дрифту, машинам и вообще к гонкам... Отдельная благодарность группе Hoonigan! Обязательно буду рассказывать о тебе своим детям!
Im still having a hard time watching anything with Ken. The autosport world world got colder without one of its most shining  flames. R.I.P. Block   Your body of work will be around to inspire generations and your Legend will continue on.
One of the reasons I have an old Hawkeye wrx Sti as my weekend car. R.I.P. Mr Block 🙏🏾
Who else cried the whole time watching this?
rip ken gone but never forgotten ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Grandísimo Juca y puro Ken Block hasta el cielo ❤️
Thanks.  Now I’m crying again and getting weird looks from random people driving past me on lunch.
An awesome tribute to such a lovely, decent, honest, humble, funny and talented guy, who was and will always be a F**KiING LEGEND! So sad that you are no longer with us but you legacy will always live on, and you will always be missed! All my love and heartfelt sympathy to your family, friends and loved ones! And yes I did shed a tear and I'm glad that I did! ❤❤❤❤
It's nice to see Ken even if it's just one last time. #KB43VER
Legend
The f*? Didn´t even know... RIP Ken, now you´ll truly be a legend.
😢😭I don't want it to ever end. Please come back Ken. #KB4EVER
Leaving a legacy makes you continue living even after death; he is more alive than ever and this is the proof of it.  #KB43VER
It's such a shame we couldn't see all the great projects Ken and Audi had for the future 😥
Kens facial expressions were awesome. The little 'oh shit' look as he grazed the barrier, the wince jumping on to the street sliding backwards almost into a curb. The tribute at the end with all the gymkhanas. And shutting down an airport! Only something a legend can do! KB43ver
7:09 chills.
Ken is always in our hearts! The greatest to ever do it! So many emotions watching this. #KB43VER!
No one will ever replace Ken I remember the first gymkhana and thinking how awesome it was to see someone as in tune with a car as he was
ride in paradise ken, you're such an inspiration to me and many others who love cars. thank you for your incredible contributions to the car community. ❤
Rip KB43
KB43VER
The guy who thought that putting 2 Formula-E engines in a car was a great idea is a genius.
Rest in peace Ken always the legend of drifting KB43VER🔥
R.I.P Ken a true legend #KB43VER
Rip  Ken 🪽💙 will truly be missed by us all! If your not scared then your not diving fast enough…. What a journey from the petrol power to the ev what a journey
Ken Block was one of very few guys who, if ever got pulled over and asked “do you know why I pulled you over“ could legitimately say “because I let you“.
we miss you ken

That’s was a hard one to watch RIP mister Block
Didn't think we'd get another one of these videos. Thanks guys and rip ken.
Sorry for your loss Brian. What a great gift to have been friends with that man. RIP Ken.
over the last few months I have watch people tribute Ken by drifting some of his cars and I have come to realize that Ken was amongst the very best at sliding cars with precision and an accuracy that sets him apart. I went back and watched the Gymkhana series and it was so good.
One of the greatest drivers ever, RIP Ken, always loved watching your stuff💙💙
Так неинтересно, как машинка на пульте, верните фиесту или дайте Ауди на ДВС, но уже некому
Hate electric cars because of no sound but great video
Rest in peace Legend 😔
Rip in peace Ken and all the cameras he has destroyed as well.
Ken was always sick a inspiration and he had a place in all our hearts do rip ken we miss you as a community #KB43VER
❤
That montage at the end was amazing. I grew up with every single Gymkhana and it truly has shaped my life. Thank you Hoonigan and thank you Ken Block. #KB43VER
Scotto saying "try not to crash and die" had an eerie feeling that's for sure.
Rest in peace💔💔
😢😢😢
The greatest #KB43VvER
this is the best second elctrikhana of all time 😀
🕊
A Motorsports legend embracing the future of electric vehicles then shredding it like it's just another one of his gas powered monsters just shows you how in touch Ken and his team were.
heroes get remembered but legends never die RIP to a real one
not me getting teary eyed over some squealing tires
Brings a tear to my eye
F evs and everyone who promotes them
Rest In Peace Leyend, Thx U for everything
Nice but sounds like a forklift.
Haven't cried watching a youtube video before.   Miss you Ken.
❣❣❣❣Major respects to the legend that is Ken Block.
RIP Legend
Rest in Drift, King.
I hope you're drifting in heaven. I'm going to miss you stunt car dad.
# Raise He!! Praise Dale # Give it 110 Like Ken Kb 43ver may he rest in peace will never be forgotten
Thanks for this last gift #KB43VER
Miss you Ken
Did this just bookend the greatest automotive era ever?
R.I.P #KB43VER
It feels good, thank you... 🙏🏻
makes a grown man cry
Great to see Ken one last time! Still can't belive his not with us ❤️
When Ken Drives. You Just Watch and Keep Watching the LEGEND until you realise that the video is over. 💨💨
Thank you Ken for everything 🥲.  Though you were gone too soon, it breaks my heart 💔. I remember watching you in 2006.  You were an inspiration to me.  RIP 🪦
GRANDMASTER BLOCK R.I.P.
What an absolute and amazing legend. You was too young when you left us. 💪💪💪😎😎😎👍👍👍
Sad we’ll never see another
Try not to cry  Roll over. Cry.
What an incredible legacy Ken has left on the car world. #KB43VER
Solo puedo decir... Gracias Ken, nos regalaste grandes momentos, nos hiciste sentir emociones nuevas, impulsaste a muchos a seguir su sueño y tus pasos. Nos entregaste tanto de ti mientras lo disfrutabas y ahora nos dejas un gran vacío... Un abrazo desde México hasta el cielo. Gracias equipo Hoonigan por su trabajo, por todos estos años de videos hermosos, por visitar nuestro bonito y jodido México y por regalarnos unas escenas con el gran maestro Ken Block. Sé que no lo leerán pero, gracias weyes.
emotional
❤️43VER❤️
Love it guys! Scotto, thank you for these amazing productions.
Toujours un vrai régal de regarder les vidéos du boss💪💪!!!🤘🤘😢😢🤘🤘
K.B is immortal here on youtube.
Rest in peace, Ken Block 💙💙💙
Thank you for the montage at the end
I haven’t decided if I want to watch this video knowing that it’s the last one that Ken did. Feeling mixed emotions.
Just dont die
This will be a golden memory for us, thank you Ken. #KB43VER
Miss you Ken. Thank you for everything ❤️ you’ll live on in our hearts forever.
4:09, that brace for impact, epic shot man... Legend.
we all miss u ken. wow i cant believe it, nearly 1 year with out this legend #KB43VER #RIP43
Man I normally don’t comment but I was insanely hype to see this man drive one more time!!!!!
Ken block will forever be remembered
Thank you guys for posting this one last film. It was soo awesome and amazing to watch and painful aswell knowing we won’t ever be able to see another one again. Truly impacted all of car culture and was a huge inspiration for us all❤
Of course the LEGEND himself would leave us with another masterpiece .... Never met the dude but honestly I never thought as a car enthusiast, I'd miss a race driver so much. The only other driver to do that for me so far is Aryton Senna.  Rest In Eternal Peace Ken and thank you for these absolute gems you have left for the rest of us as Memorabilia. Can't thank you and the Hoonigan crew enough.
Sin duda eres toda mi infancia y la razón x la que amo los autos. #KB43VER
#KB43VER
It actually reminds me of a radio control car.
Legend
Epic video that also made me sad and realise how much we still miss this legend! KB43VER!
El que hizo realidad los juegos de drift
The original “Drive it, like you stole it” attitude 🤙🙏 RIP THE LEGEND 👑
I probably wouldn't be in the car world if not for Ken Block. I wouldn't have made hundreds of friends from across the country and gotten into motorsports photography without him. I'm lucky enough to be around Hoonigan from time to time. Def gonna miss seeing Ken play around the world. Lia will do her dad proud though. Hoonigan is a family business and the reigns are in good hands with Lia, Lucy, Travis and Brian.  Thanks Ken. #KB4VER
We will miss you, man keep drifting for us in heaven ❤️❤️
#KB43VER
What a nice treat. Other than the man, I liked the speed bump 360. Das dope.  Rip
Singlehandedly managed to first make Subaru cool again.   Then to the impossible with Ford as well.    And  Nobody would ever Call Audi cool.  But then block signed a contract.  Put in some pointers.  And suddenly people look at Audi like the mid 80s again.   Legend. And just as Big of a loss as Senna or Schumacher.  Rip
It feels like the end of an era that was started with e-mobility, motorsport has become very emotionless. #KB43VER
Un très grand monsieur du pilotage j'espère que ces traces resteront sur le bitume.
This was such a treat. Love you guys at hoonigan and rest in peace ken, you'll always live on in the world of motorsports.
the end credits had me almost in tears, such an incredible progression and just so many fond memories of gymkhana ❤ RIP ken
Always and forever, my idle Ken block! Hoonigan for life, even though the company has sold out for more money and content is suffering. Im hoping they go back to their roots, with less commercialized shit content. Where are all the homies coming by to rip the yard and zack ripping burnouts in the office.  Content lacking the hoonigan lifestyle i grew to love from the beginning.
Thank you Ken for showing this world that cars are an endless source of art and expression, that can be utilized with little money and or all the money in the word and the smiles are the same! Thank you hoonigan team for this last little film. Insane stuff
I think imma drive to work like this today :)
It still hurts 😔
Absolutely legendary
Sad and cool, but sad. We miss You Ken Block.
Rip legend ✌️
Legendary
I can't believe this video is Ken's last, it hurts my heart, goodbye boss and thank you for all the videos you have made for us over the years ,French fan for eternity 💙🤍❤
damn, it all started at an airport and ended at one
Long Live KB
Legendary #43ver
#KB43VER
Just love how they pushed the limits and abused the car just to show what it's capable of and who better than the legend himself to do it. RIP Ken you will not be forgotten ❤
Ken block ❤
Miss Ken Bllock.  RIP.  I drive a subie because of him.  Live like everyday is your last.
R.I.P. KB43
You'r m'y god  , reast in peace !!!!!! 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
R.I.P KB 43VER.
Electric, no noise, no vibes...
Turn far enough left and you’ll find yourself going right
You clipped it together. It wasn't one continuous run like Travis patrera. Until he fucked his back up from base jumping off a building You're still trying to live off. His I mean, the last thing you did was send his daughter a pikes. Peand most of the guys are all gone on their own.
Someone needs to make a shooting star meme for that poor GoPro that went into space at 6:05
Race in peace Ken!! You will be missed!! Legend! I grew up to his videos!!
Thanks  To   Ken Block            R.I.P
Goat will be missed and great stuff Scotto thanks for the incredible vids!!
Electrickhana 3 with Lia! Hoonipig with Lia! Throw Hert's replacement tin there just give us more plz - literally no competition in this market.
Gone but never forgotten. A true legend and entertainer. Let's all give Lia the support we gave her father
RIP legend
The drift Legend is gone but he will never be forgotten his legacy of drift will never go away still hard to believe he's gone though
One last video he gave us , as a parting gift, I still can’t get over how he’s gone. I’m glad I got to meet him at goodwood when he was showcasing the cossie, such a great guy. 🙏 #KB43VER
Thank your for the core memory Ken, Scotto, and all you bunch of crazy people of Hoonigan as well as partner and sponsors that make all of this happens :’  Race in Peace, legend! #KB43VER 🫡🤘
I am so glad this emotional rollercoaster was made. One last tribute to the legend. #43ver
Amazing video like always! But EV’s will never EVER be as good as internal combustion! Cool video because it’s Ken but it’s meh on the EV part.
Ken block forever 💯💯💯
This video is soo weird on so many levels. First of all seeing these scenes of that man, that legend hooning this insane dentist drill through an empty city once more and knowing that he sadly passed away almost a full year ago.  But something is off. His driving was not as on point as it usually was, and he looks more concerned and scared than concentrated in the most scenes, and looks like not really enjoying it that much either. I don't know what it is but it makes me kinda sad.  Am I the only one seeing this?  Nevertheless all the respect in the world for you, it won't be the same without you, or at least for us it won't. We will miss you.
Hayat çok acımasız. Seni Özleyeceğiz...
R.I.P absolute legend
I never though I would be crying during a Gymkhana video, but I did. THANK YOU KEN, WE LOVE AND MISS YOU!!!!!!!!!!
Truly a masterpiece work of art. Bravo!
very nice drift stages. silence is the key.
At first of the video It sounds like a washing machine
#kb43ver
Thank you for this 🙏😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
:)
R.I.P Ken bro
The Hoonigans needed this gift from above. Race in Paradise-the GOAT!  KB43🙏
amazing as always, RIP Ken,  we miss you!
It's great to see the outpouring of love for Ken in these comments. I do also want to acknowledge how insane it is that these guys managed to get a WHOLE AIRPORT shut down for this shoot. That's a lot of sway for a bunch of scumbags.
Rest in peace to the legend.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nothing can smoke tires like that beast of a car!!!
Legend never die ! ♥
man… RIP KEN. I was like 16 when the first video came out and me and all my buddies were blown away and immediately became fans. It was an honor to have someone like him in the car community, just got my KB43VER sticker for my car unfortunately…
Awesome.
Bravo! 👏 Absolutely incredible. So bittersweet to watch this. Loved seeing all the liveries in the Hoonigan logo, and all the Gymkhana highlights. Miss you, Ken. #kb43ver
kinda boring
Rest in power KB! You will always be a legend in motorsports. #kb43ver
Enough to make a grown man cry 😢
With Impreza y Fiesta was the better Gymkhana.
We miss you Ken #KB43FOREVER
Rip Ken  But I got to say this but his older khana videos with the fiesta/Subaru and Hoonicorn are much better than this
What a humble amazing driver there will be no other driver talented as Ken block was . Rest in peace .
#KB43VER even the legendary driver has passed away, but he will live in our hearts 43VER cuz "legends never die"
I’m not crying, you’re crying! 😞❤️
#KB43VER
RIP to the GOAT
#kb43ver !!!!🙏🙏
#KB43VER
theres not that many heros in this world , KB, the best of all of them ,     AND TO AUDI NEVER LET ANYONE ELSE DRIVE THAT CAR
I refuse to watch this electric abomination. RIP the Hoonicorn and Hoonitruck.
lost him too early. he was an inspiration for many, rest in peace man
RIP Ken! May God rest your soul!  #KB43VER
Thanks for everything you brought to the automotive community Ken, the shenenigans of the gymkhana series will always stay in my memories for the rest of my days. As a fan of everything car related it excited me everytime I would see one of those videos dropping from Hoonigans.  Long live his memories, KB43VER❤
every car i build is now my own tribute to Ken, we may have lost an amazing father, friend, and entertainer. but we'll never loose the way of honing as long as there's at least one of us left
I thought Zack was gonna say "You Boys Like Mexico"
OMG this brought tears to my eyes. Thank you for this great gift.❤ #kb43
the best
Well this is it. Guess today is the day I finally process the fact that Ken is no longer with us
One last ride and was not disappointed🔥 We all miss you very much Ken thank you for all of the amazing things you done and created for the motorsports world absolute legend and forever grateful you were on this earth!! #KB43VER💚🖤
#KB43VER
KB is a Legend!

I'm tearing up every time. Every time. #KB43VER
We love and miss you Ken, you inspired so many people, myself included, to question the limits and blow past it. Thank you so much for what you accomplished and I hope one day to accomplish a fraction of what you did. Rest easy knowing you will never be forgotten. #KB43VER

Ken’s face when almost and lightly hitting things. Thank you team!! KB43VR
Crying happy tears... We miss you Ken and love you Lia. ❤
One day we will all hear him laugh again 😢
I can picture Ken Block drifting the streets of heaven right now. You may be gone but as they say Legends never die they live on and that’s exactly what you are doing now. Everyone is keeping your legendary spirit alive every single day! Thank You Ken Block for all of the incredible things that you have given us over the last decade or more! You will never be forgotten no matter what. #KB43EVR
I can't be the only one that wants all the Gymkana series on a DVD with some sort of tribute/ background life added to it. Will there be such a thing?
Thank you Ken ❤
RIP Ken Block, you left a huge impression on me and thousands of others. ❤
Beautifull last ride!   Hope scotto will continue the gymkhana series
Thank you for the one more time!!
Thank you for sharing this footage.
legend❤❤
Thank you for everything that you brought to the community all these years , you will always be remembered. KB43VER.
Now he and Paul walker can race together think positive (it aint easy tho…)
How it is possible that in the first seconds the wheels can rotate in opposite directions?
One last ride! #KB43VER ❤
Thank you Ken Block. KB43VER
Thanks bro because of u i love cars u will forever be missed
I'll admit that I've cried at the airport scene but I'm hopeful that he will be proud of the work he done and inspired people as well  RIP Kennith Block  hope you're racing Paul Walker as well
R.I.P
Truly one of a kind, you will always be remembered by so many people who looked up to you and loved what you did. Ken Block forever. #KB43VER
Only one that can make EV's cool !
Liked it before I even watched it ❤
So nobody,s gonna mention the front and rear wheels going in the opposite direction?  Thought i was seeing things..😉
#kb43ver you will be missed
Legends never die
bravo   y gracias por estos momento tan agradables.
#KB43
KB43VER!
i hope one day we get too see another series with one of the kids doing it. nonetheless i wanna say thanks to everyone who was involved over the years making these and to all who allowed him do what he did 💛💛💛💛
LLKB
Ken block is the reason why I started to build my cars. Life is to short thank you for everything you have done GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN. KB43VER
We miss you Ken!
R.I.P Mate. 😔🙏🏽
greatness
Great video for a great driver we lost to soon
#KB33VER!1 a legend!!!!
Legend ☝️
I always saw electric vehicles as soul-less sensory deprivating SJW b*tch wagons sucking the joy out of driving, like my wife... turns out I was right. RIP Mr. Block.
Импотентное видео честно
#KB43VER
Царство небесное тебе Кен! Вечная память бро!
De esos vídeos que quieres ver ! Pero que no debería tener final KB43VER
This was so much better than the Vegas piece, and a fulfilling final installment with Ken. He will be forever missed like Steve Irwin but forever thankful we had him as long as we did.
I just love you ken block for a second I forgot what happened but you are the greatest guy to walk the face of the earth with auto motive purstion to empower young guys like us you really sparked a fire in our hearts love you gee
That's something different... Drifting with a glorified Dyson, Ken sure had talent.
This is one the trippiest things I've ever experienced. Thank you Scotto,  thank you Hoonigan, KB43 for ever apart of so many lives across the world 🇿🇦🇿🇦
What a legend
RIP TO THE LEGEND KEN BLOCK !
Elon Musk Approves This Video.   How sick would that drag be, this vs Plaid......  RIP Ken Block, Forever Hooning
Спасибо Кену за это
#KB43VER
Your a big deal when you stop a massive city just for you to do a stunt.
We say good bye to a legend, to one of the good ones. We will miss you Ken
We’ll never forget you Ken ❤️ thank you for everything you’ve done during all these years 🙏
True legend ❤
Ken Block was a great driver but nothing compares to the raw power of combustion engine the noise and the power this battery crap the government trying to shove it down our throats for their own benefits is going to stop soon.
Hoonitruck. Best. 👌
omg RC models 🤮
R.I.P Ken the 🐐 you will forever be missed !
Its a NO, go back on gasoline
For a moment… it felt like he wasn’t gone. Thank you, for everything, Ken
@dailydrivenexotics! Check this out DDE fam! Ken block forever!
Thank you Ken and Hoonigan for bringing one final episode to the world. RIP KB.
A true legend all over the world 🌎  Hello wherever you are from Italy 🇮🇹❤
#KB43VER ❤
You'll be missed for sure !! What a man, what a driver, what a legend and what a DAD !!😢❤❤🙌 Inspiration on ALL LEVELS possible !! #KB43VER
Respect .. Thought go out to Kens Family + Friend's.  He  connected with so many people  ...
⚡️⚡️⚡️
This made me emotional
Hearing his voice at the end gave me chills. KB43ver
Ending Video outro is great memories.. Ken♥
Wow Ken really flexed his driving skills one last time for us, absolutely insane stuff. That 360 mid drift through the roundabout, the multiple insane proximity drifts, a reverse entry 180 on the freeway... legendary stuff, Ken will be missed forever, he changed the game man.
hermoso video mostrando la CDMX  solo resta decir: !Gracias Ken¡.... felicitaciones a todos lo involucrados
I'm saving this for later, like hump day dessert.
Horrible noise
Continue Tire slaying in heaven. YOU inspired millions of us, Thank you for Everything KB, 🙏 We miss you. ❤
Very cool, RIP Ken Block, Legend
The camera work is insane....looks like video game
As devastating as his loss is. we all Thank you to each and every person evolved with Gymnaka and Electricana, Most importantly thank you Ken Block for changing/creating car culture as a whole.
What a legend 🙏🏼
HHIC delivering an amazing display of tire killing for us one last time #KB43VER
Not the cleanest Gymkhana but entertaining nonetheless. This is a game of inches...millimeters, even! Miss you KB! Gone way too soon. 🙏🏾
Ken  Mother fng  Block  Wish you could have given the world more.   Thank you rest easy.  Team and family block be well. Thank you all.
Rest in peace Ken #KB43VER
Still can’t believe this dude is gone. That reality hasn’t even sunk in yet.
God dang I miss that guy!! His skill and creativity was unparalleled!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
KB43VER LOVE YOU LEGEND
KB43VER ❤
Miss you Ken.
RIP KEN BLOCK.  KB43VER
Grateful we got one more, sad that it will be the last. #KB43VER
Rest in peace Ken. The man who made the car his light sabre. #kb43ver
Just watched this on break at work and truly will miss the legend 43ever videos
Thank you for everything Hoonigan and KB. Truly shaped a generation of gearheads
Ken block terbaik🔥🔥🔥
KB43ver
Thank you, KB.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I just didn't want the video to end 😪  #KB43VER
RIP Ken Block 🙌🙌🙌🙌💪🏽💪🏽
This man had a massive impact on my life. He’s not gone. He lives on forever through all of us ❤
Stopped watching at 3 minutes, electric car ruins this whole concept. Audi could have dropped a five cylinder in that car no problem. Go Electric, Go Broke.
A true early christmas present! thank you ken for inspiring many and showing what is possible. #kb43ver
Ken Was the person I looked up to, wanted to be, like a mentor you never had, listened to what he said and followed, Rip ken you'll be missed by millions.   Wish i could of met the legend. ❤  #KB43VER ☮
Damn man, of course this legend left us with one more surprise... I grew up watching a lot of legendary racers over the years, but he will be the one I remember the most for many reasons. I feel like the different generations depending on where you live in the world have their superhero drivers that will live on forever in the hearts of the fans. Ayrton Senna, Dale Earnhardt, ect... Ours is Ken Block. #KB43ver
Rest well Mr Block
we love u
absolutely love Ken but the sounds are just straight up ear poison... It's like nails on a chalkboard, fork on a dinner plate and rubbing Styrofoam together all at the same time
Sim eu chorei, bastante, o Ken block teve um impacto significativo na minha vida, justamente por ele que comecei a gostar cada vez mais do automobilismo, e me parte o coração saber que infelizmente agora só temos as memórias, só tenho a agradecer, obrigado por mudar minha vida como a de vários outros gearheads. Descanse em paz amigo
He will never be forgotten. Ken will always be an inspiration to lots of people out there. 🕊️ RIP Ken Block. ❤️🖤 #KB43VER
I can't wait to see the "making of" for this one
El mejor de todos los tiempos  y el juca
Ciao grande Ken!🥲❤ #KB43VER
The Maestro 🎶🏎🎶 Thank you Sir 🙏❤🐐.
Rest In Power The King Of Tire Smoke and Horsepower #KB43VER
to me this is the coolest shit ever, nothing compares to it. rip to a phenomenal driver
Such a bittersweet moment
My entire first real career spanned these videos, watched them all, and the last of my youth has disappeared in this time frame.  Bring back Droors Clothing for the real OG's before all this.    As much as I hate Corporate stuff, I kinda wish Audi would have forced him like the big Studios do, to have a no motorcycle, snowmobile ect clause, he'd still be here that way at least.    Thanks for the great videos!!
You are surely missed..
Legend Rip
Thank you Ken love you
#KB43VER
Losing Ken was like losing a real life superhero. #KB43ver
I can smell the rubber - absolutely nuts final performance. RIP Ken.
😭😭😭
I was in Vienna back in feb/March and came across this car in an audi window, it was unreal to see in person. My girlfriend couldn't understand what and why I was fan boying about as I was trying to tell her.
Thank you, Ken Block prayers go out to his family his name will forever be remembered that’s one of the greatest car drivers in the world. He made it look easy.
A question...was this the last time for KB??? Are there more videos that have not been released?
If Ken hits a barrier, he meant to hit the barrier.
What a legend!!
#KB43VER Thank you for pushing the automotive world to the limit and beyond Rest Easy #1HOONIGAN
ken block rip u will always be missed
Man, I miss this guy. Definitely one of one.
It aches my heart to watch this and know that there will never be another one with this kind of style and love behind the wheel, forever in our hearts #KB43VER
I don't think there could've been a better Christmas present from Hoonigan. From top to bottom all of you are automotive legends, thank you for everything over the years.
Christmas cames erlier🙏thanks for everything Ken🙌👏👏
A good send off for ken
I send all my prayers and good vibes to Ken blocks, family and friends. May he rest in peace 🪦 🙏 for everything!💚💚💚

Thanks for being an inspiration for all the under dogs in the automotive industry and all the great memories. You will truly be missed.🥲

Awesome!
The pieces of curb breaking off...
We need this to reach over 100 million so we can break GTA 6 record on YouTube just for Ken block
Good ending!
I was fine I was perfectly fine until the end goddamn it im crying thank you Ken for the memories and thank you to everyone at hoonigan give us amazing content and work throughout the years thank you all so so much.
He is still alive!!!
This is both terribly sad and awesome. Rest in peace KB, rest in peace
Very nice indeed.  Thanks for that everyone!   Where can I send in my resume?
Ah, Man! This was so nice to see. We relived what was, and will always be.  KB43FOREVER.
This hurts to watch we will you bud
F you snowmobiles, Miss Kens videos this was a real treat. Thank you. RIP KEN love from UK.
Am I the only one that waited to the last second of the video just to hopefully see Ken one more time???
Wow those 360s were clean especially the reverse 360s those are my favorite entries  RIP Ken Block Keep full sending it and stay sideways ❤
The reverse Jay turn to Jay turn🤯
My kids will know who mr. Ken Block was! The best flat out driver I’ve seen, there are many like him. None to replace him. Pastrana is great in different ways, show m someone that can drive flat out, the way he did!
KB43VER
Te amo Ken Block ❤
Sending it to the fullest till the very end.
Well that’s a wrap for those sets of tires 😅
😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sad to see it close on an EV
long live ken, you’ve inspired so many people and continue too #KB43ver❤️
🐐
Rip legend
RIP THE GOAT KEN BLOCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #KB43EVER
Rest in peace, legend..
43 forever...KB forever
Imagine the tunnel drive with the hoonicorn🤤
I still can't believe the one famous, badass dude and straight up nice guy, I followed and adored is gone...😢 RIP Ken. KB43VER
this filmed in heaven?
So sad, 43 forever!!!
I'm not sitting in the work truck crying on my lunch break, you are
The real GOAT shows us how it's done one more time.  What an amazing Christmas/Holiday gift for everyone in the world who loved Ken Block!  Thank you so very much for one last ride along with the legend himself.
Ken Block will always be remembered and missed. He showed us a new way of showing driving skills and expressed them the best. Inspiring many in many ways. Thank you to Ken and to everyone on the team ❤ KB43VER
masterpiece
Don't slow down... we miss you Ken❤  Thanks to all Hoonigan for making this video and every other one happen. Truly inspirational work by all
Wow, there was suddenly some dust in my eyes while I watched this at my desk...weird.
Could you imagine the police trying to catch Ken!! 😂😂 I'm sure he is drifting it up in the afterlife!! ❤🙏🏾
43ver
Damn, what a journey❤ I really hope to see Lia continue the Gymkhana series! Rest easy Ken❤️
What an amazing surprize. Thank you everyone for this. RIP kb
KB could drive the wheels off of anything and is missed by all. Somehow though a drift film just isn't the same without the sights and sounds of a fire belching v8. Makes this seem too easy and it's not !
Gods never die.  Hail ken block, god of the road
Thanks for another page in Ken's life. He will be missed because there will never be another like him. Thanks Scotto and all the Hoonigan crew. KB43ver.
Rest in peac legend.❤
This makes me sad that I won't be seeing this legendary man drive like this again.   But it makes me happy to see one last video with Ken in it. What a guy !!!
What a damn legend 👏 🙌 😢❤
❤❤
Ты был Великим 🙏 Спи спокойно дорогой друг. Мы будем помнить тебя
RIP Ken!
Gosh I love that guy. You could tell how great he is by the lines he's taking after the practice run and pushing everything to the edge for the real go around. Love that he lived on the edge and did what he loved. RIP #KB3VER
This really is a Cool Christmas gift from the Legend himself and the Hoonigan brand!!  Ken was truly a master, as watching him handle that Electronic machine instead of his usual engine displacement is truly just mental, and just shows his true master at his craft.  KB43ver 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤❤!!
Every time I look at a cloud I know it's Ken destroying tires up there. ❤
You're always missed Ken. May your spirit be contagious and spark a desire for a burning passion to be creative, a go getter, and breaking the game on dedication.
R.I.P
Damn I shed a tear watching this😢.. rip Ken block❤
We miss you, Ken. Truly the greatest to ever to do it. #KB43VER 🤘💚
Awesome work, Hoonigan fam. Much respect from Vegas
Que padre video y ver a juca y el vocho lo hacen aún mejor !!
6:02 Backwards jump! (over speed bump)
favorito  Ken Block’s sentimentos paz cara mais top piloto ,nosso Brasil apoiado  por ken
Absolute Legend!! Ain't no better send off than that!! RIP KB!! #KB43VER ❤
You never know what lies around the next corner so, live each day like it's your last. Leave a mark on people's lives & you shall never be forgotten. Miss you, man 😢 #KB43VER
I’m not crying I just got tire smoke in my eyes😭😭😭😭we will never forget you Ken❤️ #KB43VER
Sounds like a jet,awesome project!I still miss you Ken .#KB43evr
😢
RIP to the legend. The reviews of all the previous videos makes this so much better
Rip KB!!!
WE LOVE AND MISS YOU!!
So glad we got one more video. But did anyone else tear up watching it? Knowing it would be the last? RIP you fuckin legend. You changed the game and brought inspiration to so many people. Keep it smokey up there man!! #KB43VER
Amazing
absolute legend. one of a kind
Going be sadly missed 😢
What a legend. No one will ever replace him. Hopefully Lia will continue your legacy. Godspeed
You reckon his daughter will do the next Gymkhana?
Thank you for releasing this. KB43VER.
He is missed even in good old Germany. R.I.P.
i didn't want this one to end.
We miss you Ken. Legacy.
The fact that I'm watching this final video from one of my heroes and there's no "wow" moment in it for me is a testament to just how far Ken pushed his craft. His car control was so unbelievable that he made the most insane stunts start to seem mundane after all of these films. I still remember the feeling of picking my jaw from the floor after watching so many of these. Thank you for everything Ken! #KB43VER
I'm not crying, a bug just flew into my eye... and another in my other eye.
RIP to a legend. Thanks for taking us with you on all these crazy rides
He was the definition of legacy, im really impressed by all these years your team put into making this crazy stuff. And we all already here, so its time for the next chapter
lol
Best video I’ve watched all year.
Thank you Ken, gracias! R.I.P.
I just hope ken’s giving god something to worry about up there… rest easy legend, hoon in paradise 🫡❤️
I remember watching his very first video. I was already into drifitng and rally and he put them together flawlessly. RIP 43ver
Ken will never be gone, Earth was part of his Universal Gymkhoonigan tour  #KB43VER
RIP Ken
Man that credit sequence got me good. What a legend #kb43ver
I also want to thank the Hoonigan team for all there hard work Love you guy's also.    Just Saw Lia's Hill Climb at the Peak i was crying like a baby at the end i was feeling it with you all such a beautiful Tribute well done Lia.
I’m not crying … your crying
Wow that was epic
😢
Ken ♥♥♥ Best
Pandilla, les juro que estoy llorando, KEN fue la primer persona que me hizo amar el automovilismo, estoy tan agradecido de haberlo conocido😢  Siempre lo recordaré con gran cariño #KB43VER ❤
Amazing video guys.... A++++++ game changers in so many ways. Long live Hoonigan
RIP 43. Shame his last video was electric garbage not the Hoonicorn
Decent
R.I.P YOU LEGEND
You will never be forgotten. You shaped so many lives. Rest in peach brother.♥
I've always loved Ken's face of focus while he drives.  Did he ever talk or chatter on a mic while driving?  We miss him so much!!
The 7:07 shot is reminds me of the iconic Pike's Peak shot. Great shot and perfect capture!
The last time this monster was pushed to the limit...We Miss you so much Ken
I can’t think of a better way to end 2023, he came in with and bang and left us with absolute artwork. Master among men.
Farewell to KB. Happy for this to have happened. ❤
Always missed, never forgotten! Couldn't expect such an awesome video and tribute to the great Ken! Kill all tires dude, wherever you are! 🏎️🏎️💭💭🏁🏁 #kb43ver
#Rip43 this made me happy yet sad
You are god
Legend! Now I gotta re-watch every gymkhana ❤❤
That was amazing, I’m crying knowing it was his last 🥲😭
Back from Death.
The Legend #kb43ver
How many cars did Ken break making this?  Pretty insane.
Rest easy LEGEND
#KB43VER
A Collab hoon gymkhana between DDE (mike with the BMW Damon with the F12), hoonigan (Lia) and travis Pastrana with Subaru and Mark mccann with the Ford would be the best tribute for Ken will miss you man 43ver❤
Simply the best ever. Goat.
Ahuevo el 🪲 del juca 🇲🇽🔥
RIP 43
#kb43ver
Ken Block aka my hero. we love you ken. rip #KB43VER
"so we can be done"  Yeah Ken, you can take a rest.
R.I.P Ken.
like batman in his batmobil... wow.... ken rox
What a journey it has been, I'm truly thankful I found out about Ken's talent and the kind of person he is. Ken was a huge inspiration to me and many others. Let's hope the future of Gymkhana will be bright and hopefully just as crazy as Ken did it. #KB43VER
Thank you for inspiring my generation.
Phenom and a legend who is now partying with the likes of Shane McConkey, Prince, Ayrton Senna, JP Auclair, and Steve McQueen. An Absolute Legend!
This can’t be Mexico, the camera doesn’t have a yellow filter on it
The Last Run 🔥
Ese le mi JUCA
When news of his passing broke I think a lot of us were worried that Ken's life of extreme automotive stunts and entertainment had caught up with him.  This final video is fitting then, as the perfect example of why that could never have been the case - his willingness to perform otherworldly stunts was only ever matched by his car control and thousands of hours poured into perfecting his craft.  If it is true that you die twice - first, physically, and second when your name is spoken for the last time - Ken will be with us for a very long time yet.
RIP Ken. That car is loony.
That's a car that gets parked and will never decrease in value
So happy to have one more Gymkhana, thank you all for making sure this got finished and posted, and thank you Ken for being you. We miss you❤ If you havent already, please make a playlist of all of these.
Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes 🤡
❤43ever Love you Ken RIP and in Glory we were too damn lucky to have you here and heaven needed another angel too soon.
Ken Block u are a legend of its own kind u are truly a amazing person u changed history and now Lia is following in ur footsteps and will continue on ur legacy and create one of her own u will always be remembered.  #RIP KB43evr
R.I.P Ken Block, you were a true legend.
43ver thanks hoonigan for always being the best!
😭
🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺
прекрасные кадры, батарейка за один заезд на ноль?
I don't care where I go when I die...I just want to go wherever Ken Block is making more tire smoke.  RIP legend.
He is one of the biggest reasons i fell in love with motorsports and cars in general. R.I.P. kb43ver!
Although I love what Ken did and the film is great, I do hope race cars sounding like this are part of the future of another planet, not this one.
Whether you like motorsport or not, you have to appreciate someone who truly mastered their craft. Ken Block a perfect example of someone who mastered theirs. RIP King 🙏
Rest well Ken, thank you for everything.
Such a mixed emotion.. Happy that this video is finally out. Sad it's the last one.. just wanted to let everyone over at hoonigan know bada$$ job!!!  KB43VER
Respect!
RIP to a Legend
#KB43VER
R.I.P legend! you will allways be rememberd. much love from sweden
#43ver
The last one we'll ever get, hell of a life!
This was honestly a giant meh.
And also R.I.P to the 43 cameras that were lost in the making of this video. #KB43EVER
I really hope there is more KB footage laying around. Just randomly posted online. I thought I was seeing a ghost just now. ❤
🕊🕊🕊
#KB43VER🙏
maan this hits hard.. feels like I lost a very close friend.. a Legend was lost, but we all know his amazing love for racing lives on in Lia and she already is a certified legend and a true Hoonigan
Forever a legend! I’m so glad y’all don’t play any other audio
New names in the motorsport world may come and go, but Ken Block will forever be the Greatest Of All Time. I wish I could thank this man for all of the people he inspired to go and try things and become great. RIP to the GOAT
RIP Ken, will be the forever gymkhana goat
Thank you to Ken and the entire Hoonigan family❤️ damn I miss that man🥹 #KB4EVR
RIP legend!
Youll be forever missed Ken.  You are the reason myself and im sure many other people got into cars and racing.   Thank you for everthing, King! #KB43VER
Ken always seemed like a proper chill dude who was also incredibly talented and down to earth. He really is a huge loss to the car world.
The no engine sound makes me even more sad 😢
He did this on AWD?!
@forzahorizon5
KB 43ver ❤
Average Mexico City driver  RIP Ken. You tore it up 'til the end 🤘
Botón de La banda del jucaaaaa!!!
Still can’t believe we lost such an icon.
Thx for all Ken you will always be missed here. Cya
yup, i cried...
Every time I drive through Island Park, I think of Ken drifting the F450 through the arch at Pond’s Lodge.
Lia will carry his legacy, thank you for all your great videos Ken as well as Hoonigan. #KB43VER
#KB34VER
Thank you Hoonigan team for that gift !!! It is amazing. R.I.P. Ken ♥
LEGEND, making tires even when he is not here RIP
So happy to get one more gymkhana video from the man himself. He never knew me but so many of us knew him and the mark he’s left on the world. Shredd well brother. #kb43ver
Goodbye legend
Forever apart of my childhood. Thank you for everything legend.
At 5:20 they had to resort to a freaking fake plane because this is Mexico city's new airport and it's a total white elephant project with barely any actual flights. There's a reason it's so freaking dusty. It's rarely used by anyone.
Thanx Ken. 🕊️
💚43❤
LIKE!!! Because, it is KenBlock - greatest drift showman ever!!!, because it’s HOONIGAN! I LIKE EVERYONE OF YOU!!! It’s first chanel from America, for me!!! Because i understand it’s great job 👏🏽   BUT electric cars - it’s boring 🥲  Listening to and of video… subaru, fiesta, sound of petrol engines….  maybe i'm too old(39) - BUT!!! WE ARE PETROLHEADS!!! 😜
Cresci vendo esse cara pilotar, vai fazer muita falta no mundo automotivo
Kinda boring to watch, ngl.
I love Ken block, but the electric car is just not the same mis the pops, bangs and the flames.... it just doesn't do it for me
EV’s just don’t hit right , not the same as hearing the V8 scream 🤦‍♂️ RIP MR Block ❤️
Its amazing 😢😢❤❤❤
Goodbye, Ken. Thanks.
If you don't get goosebumps watching the end then you don't love this man and how can u not,special human being gone way too soon 😢 💔. 🤙 respect till we all leave this earth and Lia for the next generation 💯 ❤.
Legend
Кен Блок жив!!!
RIP legend 😭
❤
Because you put yourself out there, you are everywhere 43ver.
Impeccable talent as always. Block was a hero. Not to knock the effort in this and props for releasing it in Blocks memory but these videos really lack something without a screaming ICE
Thank you Ken for everything, 43 forever!❤️
True skill R. I. P ken we miss you mn😢
RIP the goat!
Emotional.

Never forget the Legacy.
I CAN'T BELIEVE JUCA IS THERE!!!!!!
RESPECT ❤❤❤❤
The hoon of hoons, hooning his hoon at the highest levels of hooning!  #KB43VER #HOONIGAN
This really hit me deep. I somehow always manage to forget that he is gone, not that i forget his legacy, but my young brain did still not comprehend, that he is gone. He wil be missed for ever, he left such a huge footprint in the automotive industry, he touched so many with his work and he influenced unbelievable many young petrolheads. Thank God we had Ken, the automotive scene would not be the same without the imcpat he had. May he rest in peace... i hope we get to see Lia continue his story... Thank you Hoonigan for sharing this last piece of art made by you and Ken with all of us... We can only be thankful, that we have been a part of this whole journey... much love from Germany!  #KB43VER
He will always be watching out for his kids and his amazing legacy will never die
everyone missis you ken rip #KB43VER
You have made my youth Ken, thank you for everything. Rest in peace. Xxx
I was not prepared for the montage at the end. Watching the last 15 years of content and thinking back about how year you waited to see what he came up with next and never once being disappointed. Ken you are missed greatly, but certainly will never be forgotten.   #KB43VER
Only Ken Block could make electric car look cool.....
Legends never die!
RIP to the Legend Ken ‘43’ Block
@ 6:00 was coolest stunt in my opinion , RIP KB
Emotional knowing this will be the last Gymkhana/Electrikhana by Ken... Ken will forever be seen as an idol for many regardless of generation... he inspired several generations and for aslong as these videos stay alive will continue to inspire many generations to come... #KB43ver 💙💙💙💙 Thank you Ken and the Hoonigan family and thank you to the Ken's family
I love it good job rip ken block
Incredible, so happy to be a part of this shoot 😢

🤘🤘🤘
LEGENDS NEVER DIE KB 43VER

Единственные ролики, при просмотре которых  даже нет мысли перемотать
RIP to one of the greatest #KB43VER
Thanks for bring this out!  Awesome to watch ken one more time.  KB43ver!
ура! пасхалочка!! спасибо тебе Кен!
The saddest thing other than losing Ken obviously,  is this will be the last gymkhana, and now it all really hits home.
Spoiler alert, he's broon breed
Anybody else get a massive lump in their throat watching the end of this?
man, I'm so emotional here, not only to be the last gymkhana, but to have followed them all, it was one if not the series of videos here on YT that when it was released, I was already excited to know what madness it was going to be lol.  Go in peace Ken, you are greatly missed by us. #KB43VER
Thanks Ken for everything, and hoonigan
First off rip ken block. But if you have this playing in your background it just sounds like a race drones the entire time
Change the title to start with ELECTRIKHANA
RIP Ken🕊We will always miss you.❤ #KB43VER
BORING. Sorry (not) ken but, boring. Bring back real cars and not these little kid toys. we all know your riding around in hoonigan up there🙏🏻
He really drove that thing like he wanted it to break!  Gonna miss that crazy guy.  43ver!
It was nice to see Ken's incredible driving skill one last time. RIP Ken.
11 minutes of goosebumps.. Thank you Ken and Hoonigan. #KB43ver
We miss you so much Ken ❤🤗
I'm not crying, you're crying. KB43VER

Just: THANK YOU ❤
Wow! Thank you. RIP. So much inspiration
Electric car. Kinda boring. Bring back Petrol pls
I knew this was coming, but it didn't make the feelings that came any less intense. Such a huge loss for the automotive community. You will be missed, Ken!
A salute to the master.
KB43VER💜
Amazing! Absolutely, phenomenal! One of the greatest drivers to ever grace this planet! And the best part is, he gave us a beautiful young lady that has the same spirit and drive as he did! My hats off to the hoonigans and Brian Scotto for all the wonderful work that they do
Gymkhana 1 in 2008 had me slack jawed and I'll never forget it. I hope the younger kids can find the same awe with the electric cars because I unfortunately can't. RIP Ken, proper car enthusiast
This is very sad but so so great unfortunately this is the last khana we will see of Mr 43 him self
#KB43VER
Go Ken!!!! We miss you.
this sound sucks... where's V8 sound, where's manual transmission... electric cars are sooooo lame...
The world its self misses this fearless man! Rest in peace Ken🙏 God bless the Blocks and stay safe out there!❤
Ken, thank you so much for Hooning around for all of those years. I'm so grateful that I grew up watching you do what you love. 43ver❤
We can’t believe it’s been almost a year, we love you Ken, hoon in peace ✌️
Recuerdo de chaval tu primera gymkana con el Subaru ...desde ese día me volvi loko .. tuve la suerte de conocerte y mi hijo tambien . Todavía no me creo que no estés ..😢😢😢 siempre fuiste y seras leyenda .. love ken 🔥💪
What do you know, Ken Block COULD drift something that was RWD... This whole time I thought he avoided drifting RWD because he couldn't do it...
I will miss him.       But you know the first thing he did in front of St Peter and the Pearly Gates was some massive donuts. He baptized the coming people in massive plumes of white smoke and black tire shreds. #KB43VER  🚙☁☁☁
Makes me sad to watch these videos of Ken. He was such an invader and inspiration to so many people. He is missed everyday!! RIP KEN and know your daughter has got your back!!
4:20  Ken’s “please don’t smack the curb” face 😂 rest easy legend ❤
#KB43VER
This just broke my heart. To think that was the last of the legend KB43 😢  @DailyDrivenExotics DDE please continue his legacy by doing what your doing and I know nothing will ever replace Ken... But you are the only ones crazy and talented enough to even come close to continuing with this. ❤#KB43
Tears of joy.
KB43EVER ❤🤘
Anyone who has disliked this should be automatically banned from YouTube, and never be able to use the internet again!! #KB43VER I never met him, but I have more respect for him than many people I actually know. His spirit will live on in every single #HOONIGAN around the world.
😢😢😢 for me you are the best forever
We miss you, Ken. Nothing would be the same without you
Legendary!
RIP my guy the greatest as always, however all these spectacles and visuals and no sound is not for me
rest in peace legend!! #kenblock43ver
Hell yeah 43VER
Just watch the video and ken deserve every bit of legend status!!!! The precision is mind blowing... you will be missed...
The king 👑
We will forever miss you, the world of Motorsport will never be the same without you. #KB43VER
👏👏👏
R.I.P. to the Legend
Not having engine noise feels weird. Still insane!!!
You will always be remember Ken for you amazing skill behind the wheel and for your amazing personality....One of the greatest...
I just want to say that Ken was and is an inspiration to me from when I was a kid to now. I’m glad we all got this last glimpse of him hooning and I want to say thank you to Ken and Brian for bringing us the Gymkhana series. We will all miss you Ken! KB43VER legends Never Die
Don’t cry cuz it’s over, cry because it happened! Rest easy Ken! Quite literally the greatest to ever do it. You’ve inspired a generation of drivers!
we all miss you#KB43VER
R.I.P. KB43. #KB43VER
Thanks for all the memories growing up and always making it seem like we all were hoonigans in our mom and dads cars in the snow. You inspired many many kids to get into cars. I think Kens death was one of the few famous deaths that actually hit me personally.  RIP KEN.
I'm not crying, you are! If there's one person who can make me love EVs that you. #kb43ver
That is really awesome. Visionary ken block
Надо отпустить…. А я не могу этого сделать. Кен навсегда в моем сердце. Мне до сих пор кажется, что он просто занят своими делами и очень скоро снова даст о себе знать…    Я буду говорить своим детям и, даст Бог, внукам, что я видел в реальном времени, как творил Кен! Я с гордостью могу говорить, что застал его. Сердце разбивается на части…   Чистый гений. Мы все скучаем по тебе, Кен!  Благодарю команду HOONIGAN за то, что продолжаете его дело.
Ken block has always been one of my childhood heros he will be missed my heart goes out to his family #kb43ver
KB43VER
Thank you Ken, a legend that will never be forgotten. #HOONIGAN #KB43VER
thank you for this KEN and Hoonigan team!!! always be missed ♥
And this makes it official, electric cars don't sound as cool.
My hero forever the king of drift forever thank you for the amazing electrikhana moments in mexico city we still miss you Ken block keep the legacy alive for ken❤😢😢😢😢
Nobody could close down major cities with ability, personality and a friendly smile like Ken...Bless all close friends and family. Thank you for releasing this content, as we know you didn't have to. Peace to all of you and yours.
An amazing send-off to Ken Block's Gymkhana videos, ending on an airport tarmac where it all began! It's very impressive that you guys had that much freedom to film and got the airport deserted like that. Only for a legend. RIP Ken #KB43ver
I am so glad everyone involved in this finished it and released it.  We got one last hoorah, and it made me smile...  I needed that this week.   We miss you Ken.  RIP.
Ken is the only person who can make a blender seem exciting. RIP Legend.
Cringe sound
That montage at the end had me tearing up. I grew up watching all the gymkhana videos as they came out. Ken Block changed the game for everyone. You will be missed you legend. Thank you Hoonigan team for everything.
Ao mesmo tempo o conforto em ver o Ken novamente e a tristeza que não teremos mais, que os mais jovens sigam seus passos e que seus ensinamentos reverberam por anos.. #KB43ver ❤🇧🇷
спасибо тебе, легенда
4.23 is such a special moment. Wincing to see if he’s going to hit those bushes. Thank you for all you did to the car scene KB, you’ll be forever missed!
Hoon in peace and thanks for the memories
Screw snowmobiles man!!! We miss you Ken!
We miss you Ken 😢
The fact that his daughter Leah took over his legacy and is doing an absolutely phenomenal job. I'd be coming the youngest hoonigan to ever pilot one of these awesome machines. I think he has done nothing short of being a perfect father for leading his daughter to the past that she is on. #goblock!
❤💯
RIP Legend. 🙏🏼
I'm not crying at work, you are! 😢  A great video, from the team at Hoonigan. It was done beautifully.
Love you guys but once a hear that EV "sound,"  my hand naturally closes the screen.
43ver… I’m smiling from ear to ear while crying at the same time. Never for one second take any day for granted… tomorrow isn’t always a guarantee. I know where ever you are Ken, you are making it a better place. Your daughter is becoming such a legend just like you. I bet you are so damn proud of that girl… I would be absolutely. Keep looking out for her and may you lead her in the best route possible. ❤
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Thank you Ken & co.!
r.i.p ken whe loved you you were a great man who inspired lots of people and also me no human can better drive than him his cars are lengendary like the hoonitron,hoonicorn and more 😢 rip
Legends never die!
A legend that will be missed. I didn't believe it that day when i woke up and read the news.. Thanks Ken & The Hoonigang for being an inspiration! Rest easy legend! May there be lots of rubber smoke and roaring engines up there <3 #kb43ver
Как же это... уёбищно
Thank you Ken, thank you Brian and hoonigan, thank you for all this incredible work and thanks for bringing this memories today! Ken you always will be remembered in Motorsports community… KB43VER
Damn the ending hits hard. Those years were beautiful. Now we wait for Lia to take the wheel
RIP GOAT🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿❤️❤️❤️❤️
My birthday is January 12th and this past January was one of the hardest and saddest because of Ken's passing. This upcoming January will be spent remembering and hooning in his honor. #KB43ver
I just can't believe that this man is no longer alive. Rest in peace, K.B.
Rip to the absolute legend him self. I've looked up to this man for so many years it sucks to see him gone. But I know Leah will carry on his legacy without a doubt. I hope all is going ok for her and the rest of his family as well. Rip Ken. KB4ever!!!!
My man Ken is like 2Pac, he is dead but he still releases new singles every year...
Legendary man ❤
El pinche JUCA!!😮
Thank you ken *Claps  Claps* Thank you Ken *Claps Claps*
он же умер
What a epic finally to Ken blocks legendary videos. The legend will most definitely be missed 😢 K43
Filled with a wide range of emotions watching this. Grateful to see Ken shred something again for the 1st time... and at the same time extremely saddened that it won't happen again. R.I.P Mr. Block ❤
Two things I really miss watching this video, first Ken. May he rest in peace. 2nd the sound of an engine. It’s not the same with the robot’s sound effects
Love seeing Ken behind the wheel, ripping around in another one of these amazing videos. He was just getting started in the Hoonitron.  #KB43VER
Rip
I’m really going to miss this man, thank you so much Ken for inspiring us all to be better people, you were the Father I want to be and the friend I try to be and you will never be forgotten brother
I can understand understand why it took awhile to release this, imagine having to edit this then the montage at the end without getting emotional.  r.i.p. Ken Block.
#kb43ver
I’m not your crying…you’re crying!! 🥺😢
Spent the entire video tearing up, all while my jaw was on the floor from some of those entries. #KB43ver we miss you
Sounds like a nerf ball
rest and peace dude...   always in my heart <3
Right in the feels...  I can't imagine what it was like for you folks.    Thank you.
Omg… engine’s sound…. 💁🏼‍♂️
Thank you Hoonigan, Brian and the Block family. This was everything it should have been, Ken would be amazingly proud. Ken, you will be missed. #KB43VER
❤❤❤
Casi lloró, increíble que su último fuera en CDMX 😭 #KB43VER
Rest in Peace Ken, still in shock for almost one year now.
Great send-off for Ken.  Leaving the "passing of the torch" for the next one.  Travis finishing and Lia showing up to ride off in the hoonitruck like he did.
am i going to feel sad at the end of this video....?  edit: turns out it made me happy . RIP,  nobody done it better.
KB43VER, thanks for all legend
Awesome. And a bit of a tear showing up while the motage through the years was happening. #KB43VER
KEN   43EVER   43EVER   43EVER
4:20 a cara dele kkkkkk ficou muito bom !!!!!! 4:21 😂
Thank you
Miss you Ken! 😭
Top Top Top. The best pilot Drift
Goodbye, Ken. Thank you for all of the memories.
RIP legend.... we miss you and still will miss you forever, no more dope videos
Thank you Ken and Team for more then a decade of awesome content! Rest in peace! #kb43ver
🐐  R.I.P #KB43VER
7:07 oof. #KB43VER
Por siempre KEN BLOCK......☠
The last one. He didn't know, we didn't know. The look in his eyes of not having a clue how the next few months would play out. Also the look in his eyes of not giving a fuck how the next few months would play out, it didn't matter. Only that moment mattered so live it.  Just don't die.
I'm not crying, you're crying.... breath taking driving as always, amazing tricks.#kb43ver <3
Thank you Ken, if it weren’t for you I wouldn’t be into cars and made as many great friends thanks to you I’m forever grateful, I’m able to work with late model race cars and weld chassis’s now thanks to you. Race in peace 🏎️
RIP Ken
sad to realize we will never get to watch another with Ken. Such an inspiration to motorsports and inspired a generation of car enthusiasts. Hopefully they continue the series with LIa, because she is proving to be a very talented driver. #kb43ver
rest in peace drift in the clouds ken block😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😢
Nobody will ever do it better! But looking forward to see what Lia has to offer!!! RIP Ken Block.
Legend has it that the white clouds in the sky are actually Ken block doing what he loves in heaven...
Sad times. He seemed like a genuine guy. Rest easy 💯
For everything wrong with car culture, Ken was everything right. No replacement. Thanks for finishing this. #KB43EVER
always in my hearth king block💪💪
The Biggest Homage that everyone wishes. Representative from all which love Ken and Hoonigan. This Video will be allways be in our hearts and our Souls. THANK YOU #kb43ver
Watched about 30seconds, waste of time without engine sounds. May as well watch it on mute.
2008, 2009, 2012, 2016 are my all time favorites, but to tell the truth, they are all a masterpiece, due to the well-done maneuvers by Ken, and also, due to the effort that you at Hoonigan put into all the work that these videos entail. Ken was a G.O.A.T in this sport and will truly be missed. He inspired my love for motorsports, and this style of driving. Since I saw the first Gymkhana, I was very impressed. I will miss the anticipation of waiting every year to see what Ken would impress us with in another Gymkhana. KB43ver!
Cool last video. Nice watching you Ken.
I'll probably still not get over how his death hit so many people around the world. I only knew,who ken block was when I was 16 only because I got told he was a rally driver and watching his videos though out the last 5 yrs of me knowing who he was ill always watch anything that comes up with him involved watching him made me like rallying and got me into it so deep
I don’t cry that much but every time I watch a video with Ken in it it does bring a tear to the eye, we will never forget you Mr.Block #KB43er ❤
Rip Ken good job
RiP Legend!!
Damn I’ve never been so sad after watching such an insane video.. #KB43VER
СТОП, СТОП, СТОП, ЧИВО? Коробка передач на электротачке? Чего блин? Это как и зачем?
thank you for the childhood memories ken. legend and will best missed forever #KB43ver
La peor de su vida, viva la ⛽
It was truly an honour sir. Fly high.
Thank you Ken
What happened to people in Mexico City? How come there are none?
I thought he was deader than a door nail.
RIP Legend
To this day it still hurts
Ken changed everything . If you’re even a small time car guy/girl . Ken paved new roads for future generations . Thanks #kbforever and remember to Kill All Tires !
Legends never die , always in the heart #KB43VER ❤🙏🫡
In memory of ...? I didn't get it and had to Google. Died on a snowmobile accident in jan 2023. I am sorry. RIP Ken ❤. Thank you for the great shows you gave us.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
O final do vídeo,  mostrando tudo que já fez durante os anos, tenho que dizer que caiu uma lágrima..........kb43ver !!!!
bittersweet to say the least  -   Fly High Legend ❤🕊 #kb43ver   edit:  the sounds this car produces are ELECTRIFIED ASMR 🤤
Never slow down #KB43VER
Forever A Legend.
This video is prime example of EV's are boring AF.  Throughout the video it sounded like a dental  treatment.
I got chills and tearing in the beginning and then at the end seeing all of the gymkhanas afterwards I started uncontrollably crying he really made such a great impact and did some very unimaginable things no one thought would be done and really impacted the world of motorsports and so many peoples lives. He really lived life to its fullest and he will be missed and never forgotten. You are a legend Ken Block and your legacy will live on forever. KB43VER❤
Thank you
❤
❤ #kb43ver
He was exceptional its just that one person that does not drive with his mind hands and feet he drives with his soul.RIP Ken will miss this kinda movies
FOREVER 43!! FOREVER MISSED NEVER FORGOTTEN. Thank you Ken for giving the world this crazy thing called Gymkhana.  There's a reason the parking lot at the elementary school across the street from me always has people doing doughnuts in it, its YOU. THANK YOU
Cool cool dopest gymkhana video legends never die they only exist
Truly and end to a great era in automotive/motorsport media. So many of us got into cars/motorsport content because of this series. Thank you Ken, Brian, and all the team.

😢 miss him
Thanks for all the memories, GOAT.
I’m not crying yall are fuckin crying 🏁🏁🏁
you r a legend. u will be missed. no one could ever match what you've done to your discipline which became an art. I watched all videos many times like many and each time you raise the bar higher, faster. Hoonigan forever. Love u Ken.
I really don't like those electric gymkhana videos, there is no spirit in them like with a car with combustion engine.
Short and sweet....Thankyou Ken. What an incredible Husband and Father. Love seeing lia driving.
Rest in peace legend ❤
Rip KB, A true legend.
Grande ken! #KB43VER

Much love for Ken Block but this Audi sounds like an R/C Car -.- fucking shame that they will get Credit for it. I would prefere Ford or Subaru instead of Audi -.- Anyways R.i.P KEN Block always be missed
R.I.P G.O.A.T KEN BLOCK!!!🥺
Almost look like someone smashed a Genesis Coupe
This feels like a b rated movie compared to the early hoonigan videos. Either bad director (most likely) or screenplay, or who knows, i'm not impressed or feeling anything WOW about this
❤Love you Ken!❤ You would be missed rest in peace man!💯
You just had to hit me with the feelings today huh....🥲 RIP to the legend and one of the top car guys from our generation! Never will there be another ken block! Let the memories and his legend live on!

Thank you Block Family.  Thank you friends of the Block Family.  Thank you Hoonigan.  From far away I feel the loss, I cannot imagine how much it must still hurt having been close to him.
Simplemente hermoso, y que hayabsido en mexico no tiene precio. KB43VER

There are others like him.... but not really. For me, Ken will always be a reminder to live my life the best way I can, doing as much as i can and hope that I can be so lucky as him to leave this life doing just that.
Rest in peace Ken Block you will never be forgotten from all of us gearheads
someone is cutting onions in my room.... #KB43VER
❤😂
Poor guy’s vaccines and boosters kicked in during that snowmobile ride, nobody will disclose it though. There was something sus about his death & hopefully it will be revealed
Forever 43.  RIP King-Khana.

Love you. Ken Block.
Спасибо тебе за детство!!!!❤❤❤❤❤

Ken Block.....RIP to the legend Ken Block
I wonder if they know.. How they live in MEXICO.. It’s almost unbelievable Ken and Paul Walker are gone 😞 I hate to sound ‘sick’ and I don’t wish ill on ANYONE BUT out of everyone the Lord could’ve took Blueface or Charleston White.. I REALLY hope the Hoonigan team is still in touch with Lia and checking up on her 🤞🏽 RaceInPeace DaddyBlock! You’ve been an inspiration to countless & have spread so much positivity throughout 🕊️
What internet provider do you guys think heaven has?
*Г О В Н О* как собственно все электро-автомобили
Aw man, that was perfect. Thank you Scotto and Hoonigan for realizing this final masterpiece, and thank you Ken for living it ❤
I'm not crying, you are.  Absolute legend and a true inspiration.

I know it was hard for the Hoonigan team to produce this, god bless y'all.
This may fall on deaf ears but I just needed to say that this man was my childhood I grew up wanting to be like him. Taken from this world all too soon. You will be missed dearly . Thank you ken for all the great memories
I HOPE lia will , one day, make a gymkana !
So awsome definitely lost an amazing guy
R.I.P Ken thanks for all the years of entertainment literally the man that could send any vehicle 🙌👏
I'm so pumped this was released, this is the perfect tribute to such a great guy and fantastic driver. Seeing Lia's career behind the wheel progressing so well, it would be amazing if this series was carried forward in the future too. KB43VER 🙌🙏
4:21 He was ready and willing
You will forever be missed and loved, Mr. Block. <3 Everyone whishes they could be like you.

Leyenda. The godkhana 🔥
Legends never die. What an artist
Gone way too soon, Ken was an absolute legend and a pioneer in the car/ motorsport world. Will always be an idol of mine and i aspire to live life how he did. #KB43VER
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. Thank you for being our hero Ken ❤️

God damn ninjas cutting onions!
I’m still so mad that shit happen to him like why him, he will be forever missed
What a great talent lost! So grateful I was able to see Ken doing stuff like this on the hill of Goodwood at the festival of speed! I would love to this car attack that hill though!
How are you not going to end the video with a picture of Ken Block?
KB4ever ❤
this was extra sad with it sounding like an rc car. Rip Block
amazing
The Audi S1"hoonitron" is a deadliest toy ever build
Can’t wait for the Lego set of this car
Rest in peace Ken, keep shredding up there!
I still can't believe you are gone.....Thank you, thank you for giving us all these videos that we can all watch for years to come and while we enjoy watching them, we can all see how you enjoyed making them.....🙌
A true legend
No Sound, No Action - The S1 is boring !
THATS WHY HE'S THE GOAT
The first Ken block gymkhana was at an airport - the last Ken Block gymkhana ends at an airport
джимхану никто не заменит. хоть вы 100 выпусков сделайте
Grande Ken Block! 🏁
Ken was the Rob Dyrdek of the motorsports world. Gonna be hard to follow him up. we miss you man
The most endearing part of the Gym/Electrikana series is filming essentially what 99% of people only dream of doing with a car. The stunts filmed are like watching a real life version of a child playing with a car… long live Ken Block RIP!
I watch him from the first Gymkhana he ever made, even make Gymkhana my nick name. Don't believe guy is not with us anymore. I hope Lia can continue what our beloved man has create because Gymkhana video is a tradition. RIP Ken Block #KB43EVER.
Man took the automotive industry an gave it his own spin. Literally🤘🏽. Still doesn’t feel real but we will never forget. Can’t wait to see what’s next to come from the Block family an hoonigan. Please keep this alive and thriving in his name❤️.
thank you Ken Block! #kb43ver
Kent legit playing GTA out here just drifting all over the world the air port reminded me of gta for sure !
#KB43VER
Rest in paradise legend
It's great that we're lucky enough to see one last ride. I do hope there are plans to continue the Gymkhana/Climbkhana series to keep his legacy alive.
KB43VER, the world of motorsports is going to miss you Ken.
I had goosebumps throughout the whole video... <3  #KB43VER
Absolute LEGEND!!!!! RIP to the best driver this earth has ever seen!!!! 🫡🫡
RIP KEN
RIP
Rest in peace legend kb43. Just was hoping it wouldnt have been a petrol powered symphonie for your final honor instead of a squeekie one❤
RIP ken block I'll will never forget what your gymkhana videos done for me in my life and millions of others so thank you hoonigan and Ken block for every single one of the gymkhana videos 👍🏻
Спи спокойно Кен ! Ты навсегда останешься в наших сердцах.
Ken wir werden dich vermissen ✌️
Thankyou Ken for everything.. hope your up there Hoonin your way around those pearly gates my friend, will have to catch up with you later. Immortalized by legacy we will never forget you
Rest in speed
Only knew about him for a year but it feels like i known him for 20yrs long live KB
He went out with a bang, Rest in DC Shoes brother
A fitting send off. But also a good place to end the series because it was not as sharp as some of the others. Might have been the car, might have been the setting. Still some very impressive driving.
#kb43ver
Rest easy brother.
Thanks Ken, thanks for all the beautiful art you made with the cars, with your group of friends! Thanks Scotto for giving us a beautiful video! Ken is missed very much! Greetings and hugs from Argentina RIP KEN BLOCK   #KB43VER
Wow!!! This is an improvement of Electrikhana in every way! The changes to the car improved handling, Ken was more confident, the tricks are much more visual and interesting. And most of all, the Hoonitron stand at its own. I was taken out of the moment so many times under EK1 because historic racecars I rather would see hooned took the spotlight. This is much better. Ken, I really miss you and your SoMe posts of you being creative, having fun and enjoying life. This has been a though year without you.
Now I’m crying at 8:30 am. Such an amazing person gone wayyyy to soon
I miss Ken Block man almost cried watching this
#kb43ver.... press f to respect....
To say I was surprised seeing this video show up is an understatement. What a gift! Thank you Hoonigan team for these efforts, I'm sure a lot of tears where shed while working on this video, and what a note to close the series on: Seeing Ken doing what he did, that talent and that enthusiasm.   He is missed.  #KB43VER
The first celebrity I felt the loss on the world when he died
Wild video🔥🔥, viva México 🇲🇽🇲🇽
youll be missed you legend #KB43VER
This brings a happy tear to my eyes, knowing this will be the final time we see ken block drift, the last time we ever got to watch him hoon like a true hoonigan… for fun, for laughs, for entertainment, for us to be happy. Thank you ken block for all the laughs, blown up engines, melted clutch discs, torn transmission gears, tire smoke, drifs, backfires, inspirational moments, especially every win in the overpowered hoonicorn v2, but most importantly dedicating your life to being a hoonigan. We are forever grateful for every moment we shared with you, it was an honor, a pleasure, and a absolutely amazing time every time. R. I. P. Ken Block. I hope lia becomes an even better drifter and hoonigan than Ken was, look out piston rings because she’s just as much a block as Ken was, except she’s fearless. #kenblockforever we miss you brother
RIP Ken 43
R.I.P. TO THE GOAT!!!!!!!!
He died a legend. RIP Ken
pain
i dont think ken ends here. remember his BADASS daughter. i believe she takes his legasy and tops it with her own. i hope to see you out there leah.
Absolutely beautiful ! Please keep throwing out compilations of random clips of the wonderful legend of a man Mr Ken Block. It’s so nice to see & hear him. He really is missed so much. Thank you Hoonigan. Still feeling the pain this end too.
🥹KB4343VER Ken will always be in the race community’s hearts and minds! ❤
The last one , But not the least  Thanks for what you did to make car culture et great and incredibly fun thing.
RIP Ken Block. Thank you 4 all, we will never forget you❤️
Such a legend, and now his daughter is becoming her own legend. I'm sure he would be proud! Congrats to Leah on her racing career! 😊
Legends never die . 🤘
Nice to see him back sadly its without a engine screaming in background 😢
RIP 43ver
🥺😭 KB43VR
Electric Cars are boring...I celebrate those boring car.😊 Thanks for entertaining us, Ken❤
Race In Peace Ken, you are greatly missed, but you will never be forgotten!!
Thank you for this guys. KEN, YOU ARE A LEGEND FOREVER AN ALWAYS.
cuual ghymkhana es el del minuto 10:10? asombrosas hazañas
What a great way to end the series. Electrikhana 2 was Insane but also not over the top, much like the first Gymkhana. I'm sure Ken is still doing epic doughnuts up in the race track of the sky. #kb43ver
miss you ken, the world of motorsports, games, and everything we watch are forever changed and inspired by you just having fun.
The legacy will live on forever❤️
LEGEND SAYS IT ALL
He wasn't the best driver but he could make a car look amazing in camera to win our hearts, rest in peace ken!
no way
Rest in peace, legend. Thank you for all the entertainment and inspiration over the years.
Two leyends in the same video, Ken and Juca ❤❤
forever kb43, thanks ken and hoonigan for years of awesome car shit. no one will ever touch your legacy ken.
Hard to watch without emotions.  RIP KB43
Thank you Ken and Hoonigan for being a huge part of a lot of our lives. Don't slow down! 🤘😎
Classy tribute to Ken. #KB43VER
And the builds. How’s that thing not come apart??? Over curds and speed bumps sideways
There will never be another Ken Block
No other like ken block... This man changed the game in motorsports... With all of my heart... Thank you.. kb43ver  Love from Venezuela

Legends never die 🕊️🕊️
The King #KB43VER <3
RIP Ken one the greatest to ever do it!🔥 Just so you guys know The Crew MOTORFEST  just had an update featuring Hoonigan. It’s got the Hoonicorn Mustang, and the Hoonitron Audi. These are the cars you guys just saw on video. Just thought I should let y’all know. 27 days till the event ends. There’s more to the event than just the cars tho.
4:08 that beetle is sexy. Nice they included that, to rep VW and Mexico
rip a great driver you will be missed❤❤❤
Love the bits where he smashes a camera off the wall or better where he thought he was about to meet the curb and braced for it only to keep it going. Amazing work Ken.
I almost cried at end🥹
Such a legendary driver.
Mojster volana ... Počivaj v miru. 🚙🚀🛸🌎🗽🌅🙏

4 wheel burnout, what a monster of a car, and Ken was a maestro driving it.  Thanks Hoonigan for this gift #ripkenblock #KB43VER
We just miss you forever. Keep wherever you are!
I wonder what he's driving in heaven now?? RIP Ken!! you will always be missed and loved by millions of fans brother ❤❤❤ 🥲🥲
Rip Ken Block

This one hit way harder than i thought it was going to be
Bye Hoonigan, it's been fun. Officially dead now.
Love to see ken block doing what he loves to do. Rip legend. ❤
It hurts knowing this is the last gymkhana we will see with ken block. Rip. Anxiously awaiting the first gymkhana starring Lia block.
Аккумуляторный блендер в деле) даже шины черным не рисуют) вот время настало
Thank you for this final production. What a way to (maybe) end it. #KB43VER
locura total por siempre ken block!!!!!!!!!!
4:44 is just flabbergasting .  Adios Amigo. 💔
RIP Legend! Never to be forgotten!
What an absolute legend. Gone too soon.. While Lia is proving to be an amazing driver; there will never be someone like Ken. Until we meet again. 🫡🙏
43. Man. Him and the crew put out the best shit by far. I’ve watched other monster energy vidjas . Not the same energy. He was a beast. Still is. No ones touching him
Ken Block will always be the best there is #KB43EVER
Thank you Ken, i've always loved this series so much and it's sad that this one was the last with you..... But it was, as always, so good! We miss you! #KB43VER❤❤❤
papa fernando!!
In the wake of Ken Block's departure, his final video stands as a bittersweet masterpiece, a poignant dance of tire smoke and roaring engines that encapsulates the essence of his unparalleled talent. The emotions it evokes are a mix of admiration for his prowess and a deep sense of loss for a driving force in the automotive world. As we bid farewell to a legend, may his tire tracks forever etch a lasting imprint on the asphalt of our memories.❤
Rest in peace Legend 🙏
♥♥♥
imagine to do the things you do in gta but in real life
Missed globaly and to see a video just uploaded is so sad really that your not here, all the fans are still here to support you your daughter and family , I hope she carrys your lifestyle on and brings us as much as you do Ken hooni for life
Tremendous way to end in one of the best countries like Mexico, thanks to Ken for considering this country for one of his videos, kb43 forever...
#KB43VER
Wow. What a video! We miss you Ken, loved the bit of Nostalgia!  #KB43VER
I was hoping the torch would be passed to Lia Block next. That would have been cool to see at the end of this video. It will be amazing to see her next.
to drift a 4 wheel drive car is really impressive
always going to be my biggest inspiration. <3 to you Ken
That montage at the end was so nostalgic. Rest in peace Ken.
Miss you already Ken, been watching this channel since day one. Can’t wait fir what’s next to come. #kb43ver
Best driver that ever lived!! Miss you !!!
Absolute legend 💪
Legends never die!
Sick car!!!  Amazing car to send off the last video.

Thank you Ken🙏🥹, love you man❤️🤜🏼🤛🏼
lo único que diré es KB43VER!!!!
I miss Ken Block 😢
I got such a smile to open my YouTube and see a new Ken Block video, and instantly felt a bit of somber emotion come over me.  Awesome Hoonigan video of Ken doing what only he could do.  Great work guys.
#43ver ❤
okay so i’m crying 😭 going to marathon these later 🩶 big love to all 🩶thank you so much
11:15am on Wednesday 12-6-23 a new tear fell as to be reassured how anyone that likes swapped cars new who Ken B was . We will never forget KB43ver
He was truly a master at his craft!
this is when you like something that is no longer there, we all liked ken block, but he is no longer there, with this last clip, he showed us that even if he is gone, he will still be the ken that everyone knows, but somehow things are not the way we want them to be, and they are the way they really are, ken if they are looking at these lines that I am writing from somewhere, I would say only a few things, one is that you made motorsport great, and the other is that you showed what you can do best, and something in addition, I hope you have enough space up there to drive there as you would like to be on earth with us, the pain is very bad while I was looking at you, I guess it was the same for others as I think, but that looking at one of the idols , with the last video it's disgusting, wherever you watch it from, it's bad, it's disgusting, great pain, at the risk of repeating myself, I hope you have a big place there and I hope you do a lot of your crazy things that you used to do here on earth with us, rest in peace ken block ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Im not crying, your crying.  Long Live the Legend of Ken Block!!!!!!  We're all lucky to have been able to watch him do what he does.
RIP Ken. How did you guys shut down an airport. Amazing! #43ver.
KB43 for fucking forever. 😢❤

The donut inside a donut, is that called a munchkin donut?  LOL   This video made my day.  RIP#43
This man would be so proud of his daughter Lia in what she has accomplished!!!! #KB43VER
Rest in Speed Peace, Ken! 🤘
Ken Block will never die. We will remember you and we will miss you.:(((
Once a legend always a legend
Thanks. ❤
Miss you sir
I cried at the beginning and cried at the end. Ken has been an inspiration and someone I looked up to since I was a kid and it sucks that he’s gone. Ken and Hoonigan changed the auto world and I know he’s in a better place watching his kids grow. We love you Ken. #KB43ver❤
We all miss ya Ken
So good to see Ken driving one more time. Thank you. Thank you Ken for being the man you were. A true inspiration to so many. KB43ver!! Hoonigan legends Forever!!
Its cool and all… but it’s also boring… not because of ev.. but because of the concept… it’s the same and same and same.. just different cars and camera’s working overtime..   Try to do something new and refreshing
🥺 #KB43ver
R.I.P. #KB43VER
Thank you.
me urge manejar mi carro como degenerado para honrar a Ken ♥
Absolutely wicked , you will be missed. You are the goat.
thank you ken.
Sounds boring as hell..
He was a master of his craft that the world of motorsport will miss. You inspire so so many. Rest in peace Ken. #KB43VER
Ken we miss you, you're an absolute legend to so many of us, I'll watch this video many many times ❤ KB43VER

He ended his Era on a closed road in Mexico. Rest easy KB.
Rip Ken ❤❤❤
Audi got dat brap brap in silent mode
Thank you for releasing this! Time flies 😭
RIP one of my heroes. That ending roll, well done boys.
I think (if you guys do another one) it should be a tribute one to Ken driven by Lia and/or Travis
2:38  @RobDahm is looking at the suspension movement right now.
Пэзэры баляя, со своими элеткрочайниками. Смотреть с первой минуты неприятно, водитель такого же мнения об этом свистке, поэтому разъебывает его. Выпитывате, чушпаны
GOOSEBUMPS!! What a legend! Thanks for posting this, We miss you Sir Block43.
bok hsssddf block 1:59 2:00 2:❤
RIP to the man who brought the joy of motor racing all across the world.
Totally miss Ken.  Been into his Gymkhana 4 and 7 vids over the past decade.   #KB43VER
Thank you for making the world a better place, Ken! We’ll miss you!  #KB43VER
When Ken brought together snowboarding, Subaru, and rallying together for the first time. I have been hooked every since.
It's like closing a book you never want to finish. RIP.
rip ken block you will be missed
Miss seeing him being goofy and having so much fun with what he loved
Ken was one of the best drivers the world has ever seen. RIP to an absolute legend
I cried
I'm sitting here wondering who's  cuttin' onions in here...and then it hit me...I just watched the last run of a brother lost...many have said it, "Ken, we miss you brother"... Lia, your many uncles will protect you, we know we ain't your dad, but we'll give you our best...godspeed...
I’m really hoping DDE and Hoonigan get together for a commemoration event or shoot a crazy video.   I used to watch KB all the way back. Such an inspiring individual.
im so glad that lego did a collab with you guys or audi to make the Hoonitron an speedchampions set
Ken legend!  from Russia with love ❤
amazing video. you will be missed. #KB43VER
Saw this and couldn't click fast enough, ken we miss you every day that passes. From the deepest parts of the universe we love you for everything you've done for us ❤ RIP KB
Dieser Wagen ist der absolute Endgegner.... wenn jemand fragt, wer kann diesen Wagen fahren.. Ja Ken ok.. Rest der Welt verlässt den Raum. Respekt Ken... und danke Audi für dieses Denkmal. ❤
I can’t believe it’s almost been a year since we lost you. Thank you for sharing your passion with us all.
I'm big fan of ken from Peshawar❤ 😢
RIP Ken you will always be an inspiration to the car culture for all the amazing cars and stunts you made.
Ken Block you are and forever will be missed.
El Juca parchadito con el bocho, el mejor #JUCA
Tanto tiempo esperando este vídeo
Glad to have watched every one, sad this will be the last me from the legend him self.
Watching this, reliving the older videos,  knowing this is the last one makes me cry. KB43VER
Жаль конечно этого добряка😒
The best❤
I am not crying, you are crying :(... forever a legend
Let's get this to 43 million
This one hits different. RIP Ken.
This video is such a surprise and gift. Thank you so much Scotto.
Thank you for these videos Ken. These will forever be core memories of watching, wanting to be like you.  KB43VER
Thank you for everything you did, world of motorsports was infinitely better with you inspiring people to be awesome.  Still stings losing my idol and my little brother only a few days apart... Love seeing Lia driving your cars, one day I bet she'll have her own fleet of amazing vehicles to enjoy and show us. Will miss looking forward to your new shenanigans...
What he and that car could do is just incredible, just wish these electric cars had a better sound track. For a final every gymkahna, that was brilliant and the montage at the end was great. He will be missed
And absolute legend will never be replaced. Rip KB43
Thank you for everything Ken you were always an idol to me I wish I could meet you one day but unfortunately it never worked out and now that is forever. RIP Ken thanks for everything thanks for the great times we had and thanks for all that you and Hoonigen accomplished I will never forget you and will always have you in my heart even though I never got to see you live but you showed me what can be accomplished if you just want it. I will miss you as if you were a family member
Кен оставил свой след в истории, видео наследие и положительные эмоции
RIP Ken 💔
WE LOVE AND MISS YOU KEN 🫶
😄😃😄🫡🫡🫡🏆🏆🏆😄😄😄
So nice driving still get a lump in my throat and a twinge of sadness, so now we have Leah flying the flag and seems to have a fathers abilities and genes. RIP KB43
Forever a motorsport legend <3 see You in heaven King. KB43VER
43ver miss you ken
Man, what an incredible journey. A damn shame and tragedy that it came to an end so abruptly, but at least he went out doing what he loved. And that’s not all, he touched the hearts of many Motorsport enthusiasts across the world. And has helped pioneer a new meaning of what Motorsports are all about. Rest in Peace Ken. 👊🏻😔  #KB43VER
He was the best ballerina of driving
This… this is it. There will never be another Gymkhana from the legend himself. And that makes me sad.  Thanks for taking us along for the ride, Ken. We’ll miss you. #KB43VER
Rest in peace.   The best to ever do it.
#KB34VER, but cars don't have to sound like that
Hits the feels. The last one ever. Holy shit. 😢
#kb43ver
Just not the same without a petrol engine roaring away. Electric whine is bloody awful to listen too
Rest in peace ken 🙏🏻
Phenomenal. Rest in peace Ken.
Crazy how much this put me in my feels but how much is also showed me people will live on forever in our hearts minds and thankfully the internet.  #KB43VER
Thank you Mr Block.
legend. KBFOREVER
Absolutely love the legacy that Ken has created. Wonder if we’ll see a Gymkhana in ‘24?
Кен Блок в моїм сердці назавжди!Вітання хуніган з України!
Легенда!
This video feels…. like… man, I just feel bad that Ken Block couldn’t live enough to see this. Rest In Peace, Ken… #Forever43
The lack of engine sound kills all excitement. I got bored quickly.
Wait a minute.... Did ken block still alive?? 🤨
RIP Ken Block. Thank you for all you have given to the car community! ❤❤❤
❤❤❤#KB43VER
Does anyone know if this car has an actual gearbox? or is it just simulated or something.   My deepest sympathies and respect to the Block family <3
rip
Nice and amazing but.. this EV car sounds like my hoover. Miss the old ones with proper ICE Engine.RIP RB43EVR!!!
we love you Ken
isn't he dead
Don't slow down
I bet Ken is in heaven ripping them holy tires! You will forever be missed! Say hi to Paul for us as well! Rip Ken 💨
No esperaba que hubiera un último y que fuera en México y contara con la participación de Juca lo hace inolvidable. #KB43VER
Rest in power Ken 😔😔
Bro no one will ever beat you we miss u RIP #kb43ever
#KB43VER <3
KB43vER. I just changed my profile picture that was Ken for about a year. He is a legend in the car world and will be missed dearly. Fly High  Ken
KB will always remain as a legend. But for me the combustion engine is one of the core of gymkhana. An electric car could do cool moves also, but didn't catch the emotional feeling of hooning.
Mr. Block was a magician behind the wheel.
That smokescreen he laid down at the five minute mark had me tear up a little bit.
Rip Ken Block. You'll be missed.
❤
If we all love cars. Is for guys like Ken Block best dirver ever
Let's talk about hard to watch and actually feel the love through his eyes while he was making this gymkhana. We miss you Bud but we will never for you either.
Legends never die #KB43VER
#KB43VER 🖤💚
Rest in peace Ken.  Absolute legend #KB43VER
That ending credits tho 🥹
One last hoon
I Miss the sound
this made me tear up KB43ver!
i hate electrics like the one that hates rhem the most, still, watched entirely because its last ken video
KB43. Greatly missed 😔
Ken Block drove cars about as well as Wynton Marsalis plays the trumpet. RIP legend.
Thank you Mexico. Thanks Scotto. Thanks Hoonigan. Thank you Ken. Forever Missed. Never Forgotten. #KB43VER
No feeling, no sound, no nothing, ev's suck.
You the best ever man. . Legend
IM NOT CRYING YO ARE
The saddest part was his last hoon was in a EV😢
R.I.P. 43
The edit on the End was so nice 😢
4:21 if you’re not scared you ain’t going fast enough #KB43VR
We miss you Ken Block, may you be in Gymkhana heaven. #KB43VER
Ken Block Is the GOAT 🐐 🙌🏽 RIP
Rest in power KB
We love you Block, your one of the Greats!!! You will be missed.
Still not a fan of electric powered cars, no matter how they look or how quick they accelerate, nothing like the sound of a combustion engine on the rev limiter popping and banging and the flames, oh
LEGEND #KB43VER
Forever be missed...
Team Hoonigan, thank you. I’m speechless. Tears in the eyes, smile in the face, broken heart knowing there will never be another one. Gymkhana gave me hope on the days I was Ill, gives me motivation in the gym to work hard, and formost, it gave me inspiration to work in motorsport. Which I did. Growing up with Ken Block has been a fucking blessing. Love you all❤️❤️❤️
Legend. 🤌🏻kb4ever
RIP Ken Block 😇😢😭
RIP
Sounds like an RC car ripping around.... electric cars will never replace combustion engines.
43ver
Ken did so much for the scene and hoonigan specifically, still crazy to me thag hes gone. At least the gymkhana films will live in forever
Ken was such an inspiration for so many. I can say with certainty he is the reason I own a Focus ST right now, and there is a reason that Hoonigan was one of the first stickers on that car. RIP Ken #KB43VER
KB43VER!
RIP Ken
Ken ❤️
No fuel no like
I was in high school when the first gymkhana got released and man it feels like yesterday.  Your essence will be forever alive thru all this videos and your legacy is in good hands with Lia.
C'est une superbe façon de lui  rendre hommage ! Il nous manquera beaucoup !!
KB43ver🔥💪🏻
"out here doing what everyone wishes they could do"   #KB43VER
RIP Ken
#KB43VER
Absolute f**king legend! God driver.
We all miss you, Ken. RIP. You're a legend, and you've built a LEGACY.  #KB43VER!
He wasn’t a driver he was a damn pilot!! 🤘🏻
This city is what Forza Horizon 5 (Mexico) is missing!!!
Thank you Ken and everyone at Hoonigan for all the inspiration! Rest in peace legend. ❤ #kb43ver
Legend 💯
A$$holes! Made me cry again 😢 Ken IS one of my greatest icons of My life.... Still miss him, 43ver love him. ❤

Really wish we could get this car in Forza Horizon 5 just so we can pay tribute to a master driver and geat man.
Long life to Ken's legacy.
Noooooooooooooooo😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Woow woow how much horse power has this Audi?
one of the greatest to ever touch a steering wheel
what a fucking legend, stolen before its time, the whole team your guys are epic.
Thank you Ken.
Man, that closing. I think I got some tire smoke in my eyes.
I’m overjoyed to see KB doing what he loves. It was a great surprise to another last hoonigan and an early classic present. I smiled laughed and awed at some of the greatest driving known to man. Scotto and the hoonigan team thanks for the great production videos.
Only KB could reach out and connect to us all again. RIP to the greatest ever. You're truly missed.
Rest In Peace Ken. A driver of true greatness.  Shame this Audi is so god damned ugly! Such an ugly ugly car
This is the hoonigan I am here for
Yo vine para ver a JUCA 🤘🏻
The OG Youtube megastar, back when talent came first.  RIP Sir Ken
Damn,  never realised how much hoonigan and especially the gymkhana stuff has been a part of my life growing up xD.
You will be remembered as the legend that you were Ken, forever ❤️‍🩹
#KB43VER
This is so sad it will be the last gymkhana
Ken was such an innovator!  I have enjoyed watching him ever since the very first gymkana!!!   you are missed Ken   #KB43VER
OG!!

Incredible production as always! Amazing montage at the end, going through the years of gymkhana. RIP Ken, you are greatly missed.  #KB43VER
His last gymkhana 😢 long live the legend of KB! won't be another like him. That tunnel bit pumping 200 was insane!!! Incredible final chapter to an incredible series! All love KB 🙏
Thank you for everything KB43 #KB43VER
KB4EVER ❤❤❤❤ there will never be another.
KB43VER - will be missed.
RIP KB43. You'll always be remembered as an inspiration and an idol to many now and many more to come. Thank you Ken Block for everything
Love ya KB. Thanks for everything
thank you for showing us what is possible with the power of fellowship. rest in paradise.
Thank you Ken and the team for everything you guys did and all the memories you gave me over the years, I'll forever cherish my time watching gymkhana 5 for the 1st time with my dad in his old office.
The hoonitron or Electricorn makes my dog cry, but seeing Ken in his element doing what is essentially his form of heaven makes me just believe he's still doing it somewhere out there.
ken block inspired me so much 😢
Forever fly fast. 43 R.I.P KEN 😢
YOO Ken Block’s still ALIVE
Gone but never forgotten
Very sad to know this will be the last one from Ken but glad it didn't get shelved forever. Just remember heros get remember but legends never die. KB43 43VER
RIP
true end of a era, he will be missed
BEST OF THE BEST 🥲
#takeoversaredumb
I'm already tearing up... What a guy
Wasn't expecting this to be as much of an emotional watch as it was.
Thank you for letting us all be part of this ❤
RIP Ken Block, A legend and inspiration who will never be forgotten #KB43VER
KB will be remembered as a true virtuoso in the world of automotive culture
RIP
RIP Ken Block!!!
Electrikhana doesn't hold a flame to Kens Gymkhanas.  The visceral angriness of internal combustion engines at full song is hard to beat.  But the silence of the electric motors is kind of fitting now that you are gone.  RIP Ken.
2013 gymkhana is the first one ive watched and ive watched every one since
This is the best Christmas gift ever and will always be. That’s for everything Hoonigain and Ken for making the awesome enjoyable videos inspiring people. Can’t wait too see what y’all bring on next with Pastrana or Lia. Thank y’all of everything and keep Hooning safely. #KB43VER
I started tearing up knowing that when the video was over it’s over…. Never again… but his legacy will never die. RIP Ken we will never stop! KB43VER!
may be the greatest driver of all time!! just amazing! RIP.
THE electric car with the most CO2 emission out of rubber.
Rest in peace Ken 🫡
bro playin asphalt 8
Мужик ты был ахуенен!! Спасибо ты показывал супер вещи <3
WE LOVE YOU KEN #KB43VER
🥲
The lack of cool car sounds really took away from this in my book...
It's nice having these. Thank you.
fucking legend, incredible incredible man, we miss you
What a legend! He will be missed! These were my favorite videos of his to watch
That brace for impact at 4:18 as he thought "shit, ive overshot"
Ken block Is he still alive? Let's go!
RIP Ken Block
Молодцы,  это, как всегда,  круто!!!
Thank you Ken for being a huge inspiration for everyone in motorsports you legacy will go on for ever. You are missed everyday. #KB43VER
KB43VER
❤️ ❤️❤️ Well god damn boys I wasn’t expecting to blub like a little baby today 🥺 WE MISS YOU KEN 🫶🏻❤️
RIP hero!
hasta que sirvió de algo el AIFA jajajajaaj
That's not skill ! that's natural ability , the man was a freak , the best kind of freak , you are missed Ken thank you for sharing your incredible abilities with the rest of us and may you for ever be doing mach 10 with your hair on fire and keep smiling down on Lia , she is so much your daughter Ken . 43ver
💚💚💚💚💚 We love you Ken, this is one of the greatest sendoffs a legend like you could have  Block43ver
Rip
This was a great way to start the day! As the late Jim Valvano said, “If you laugh, you think, and you cry, that's a full day.” I’ve already had a full day! I’m grateful for everything KB did and he will be missed but will live on forever with the joy he gave us all! #KB43ver
I got quite emotional watching this 😂 Such a legend RIP 🙏
What happened to all of Ken’s cars and stuff does the family still have them does he still have the hoonitruck
He came, he broke the internet, he left 😢…..all always remember him by those ford fiestas from rallycross to rally to gymkhana
Ken was every child ever, playing with Hotwheels cars, throwing them around doing impossible stunts with no regard to how physics work in the real world. Except he was doing it in real cars, laughing in the face of how everyone thought things should work. We were lucky to have him, his vision for creating these incredible videos, his passion for living life and doing things just because they were fun. We'll mmiss you, Ken, but we're all better for having known you. #KB43VER
You’re missed, Ken ❤
There will only ever be one Ken Block. RIP you legend!
Legend never die 🙏 another masterpiece ride 🔥
Amazing ‼️
🇨🇵✨ken-block a prouvé a tout le monde qu'on peut faire tout avec Une caisse électrique  respect a honnigan
some of the cuts are cgi.
We need to see a race against the cyber 🛻 truck
Gone but never forgotten. You are a legend Ken. KB43VER
RIP 43ver, I still cant believe he is not with us anymore.
It’s so much cooler with ICE sounds
Dont be sad that Ken's gone. Be happy that Ken happened. 🥹  Thank you for inspiring me and many others! Your influence will continue for generations to come!
RIP Legend!
The first two gymkhanas inspired me to buy a subaru, it was something incredible! Goodbye legend. KB43ver
It still doesn't feel real man.
4:20 ахаха глаза закрыл, думал врежется
it would be the greatest if you guys managed to create a gymkhana with lia block to honor kim blocks legacy.
I cry whale watching ken drift miss you
I cry whale watching ken drift miss you
I cry whale watching ken drift miss you
I cry whale watching ken drift miss you
I cry whale watching ken drift miss you
#KB43VER
They should put a V10 on that thing
Still hate that car but so amazing to see Ken in action
The man is a legend, always will be and his driving skills are insane but god damn electric is so lame, 😅 the whibey rc car sound/ lack of presence, nothing will ever replace the joy of brapping
This is the last vid we will ever see Ken in and he is missed by all RIP 43
I wanna cry all over again... Ken Block is just one of those people you look up to and go "I might never be quite as skilled, but I wanna be like THAT GUY when I grow up." He has, and 43ever will be an inspiration and a role model to car enthusiasts everywhere. Thank you, Mr. Block. Burn some rubber on the streets of heaven for us.
I hate when the world loses good people. 😢
We miss you Ken ❤ #KB43VER
😢😢😢 hasta me dieron ganas de llorar te extrañamos block free 43👼👼
Awesomeness at its finest. Great driver, man, and he will definitely be missed KB43VER.
One of the best stunt drivers for sure, but I miss the loud engine noise.
#KB43 ❤😔
I don’t get it so he didn’t actually die???
крутой мужик был 😎
legend😢💔
Rest In Paradise Ken Block
Of ALL the absolute madness Mr. Ken has done, a g'damn snowmobile.... World misses you, Ken!
RIP KB43 😭
4❤3
KB43VER
THE HOONIGAN SPIRIT WILL LIVE ON
Rest in peace ken, we love you #KB43VER
I know it’s getting close to a year but this video really makes it sink in…KB43VER
Heroes get remembered...but legends never die.
This one was especially emotional. These videos have inspired me so much over the years and this one was equally insane. Miss you Ken ❤
You'll live forever Mr Block in us all with the biggest admiration for the king of zero f...s and one of those rare rare rare geniuses
#KB43VER ❤❤
R.I.P Ken,you will always be a legend, and are sorely missed by us petrolheads.
Thank you Brian and everyone at hoonigan for carrying on the legacy of the gnarliest dude to ever hold a steering wheel. I remember seeing the first gymkhana testing video as a kid and thinking it was the coolest thing id ever seen,  i remember watching Ken scare the shit out of James May on Top gear, so many awesome memories watching Ken do things noone else had the balls to do. I still cant believe hes not here anymore. Brian, Lia, and everyone else keeping his legacy alive, thank you. KB43VER
For one second i thought he is alive!
Szia Uram! 4 új nem lopott gumiabroncs érdekel?
LEGEND ! Period
One last gift to the world from the man himself.
RIP Ken! you will be missed!!! im glad we could join you on one last hoon
Awesome awesome awesome!  It’s rad seeing the e-tron with all four tires creeping sideways while drifting. By far my best part of both one and two.
RIP Ken you absolute LEGEND
"electric cars suck, I will only ever drive gas cars" k bro
One last ride boys. Cmon Ken. Give it your all. Race In Peace, God of the Drivers.
This is a proper send-off to Ken
The Gymkhana Series is just an autobiography of Ken's life and carcaine addiction. Long live #KB43.
#43VER
el juca saliendo ya es el mejor playground de la historia 🎉🎉🎉
R.I.P Mr block R.I.P😢
If it wasn't for Ken, the world of motorsports wouldn't be as it is nowadays, the world will remember your courage and style, keep hooning in heaven, master, we'll be there, sooner or later.  And thank you for this Christmas gift. ❤  #KB43VER
#KB43VER

#KB43VER
This was on the edge driving skill. We miss this legend still and always will be our HHIC
It's the saddest I've been while watching such an amazing video! So great for you guys to have released this footage. He was something out of this world! We miss him so much and hope for Lia and all his family find solace in the fact that he is still with us all, ripping through tires like they are butter and making us smile all the way through all his feats.  #KB43VER
That was beautiful RIP KB
🥲man I watched all of his video and even from time to time I’ll go and rewatch them I’m happy to get to see a new one
We miss you Ken. Thank you for this Brian. #KB43VER
He will be missed indeed. Let's hope that his daugher, Lia Block will be ready to take on gymkhana one day with some of her father's car collection or her own custom cars. Who knows. Sending deepest condolences to his family and friends.
4:06, que locura que Juca esté ahí
Some say we don’t have clouds in the sky anymore just tire smoke,all we know he’s called Ken Block!!! Forever missed #legend
Dude had insane car control!  R.I.P.
:Everyone Liked That:
♥
He hooned so hard in the one he broke the street at 3:27.
R.I.P. to an absolute legend, hero and role model.
♥
[R.I.P] The tires never go bald where you're at bud! Hoon in Peace, King! <3
We miss you brother
Such an amazing driver, inspired many people to get into motorsport 👍🚨 #43
I couldn’t make it through the end. I feel like watching the end will close the last chapter from my childhood that I really don’t want to close.
RIP Ken Thank you for the inspiration #KB43VER
KB and Audi created a new meaning for the "Electric Slide "!! LEGENDARY! RIP #43
Couldn't think of a better send off for Ken Thank you for the memories and the crazyness in cars over the years.
I will rewatch these for as long as I’m able to. They should all be on a playlist right next to each other.
VIDEO OF THE YEAR. WOW ! I can’t help the watery eyes, say what you want, I’m still trying to cope with this one.  We love you KEN !! To his children and wife ; we love you guys ! #KB43VER
Legend.
Wtf. I mean I’m so happy this came out but I shed a tear in the first 20 seconds. It’s inescapable. Ken made a huge impact on my life. Fuck I miss him so much.
the way he just throws the car over bumps like skipping a frisbee is insane... true life legend
Legends never die.
LOVE...LOVE....LOVE
🤘😎🤘
Ken's name should appear in the definition of "Burn Rubber".
A Gymkhana video has never made me so emotional. Gone too soon. Ken will forever be a legend.
Rip to the greatest goat of motorsports of all time we will always miss you.
Faites moi péter les Vues et les Likes 🔥🔥🔥Vive le Seul et l unique❤❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏 KEN BLOCK ❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏

You drive hard Ken, but rest easy. Thanks for the work everyone else puts in at Hoonigan to have made these  gnarly films over the years
I remember when the very first gymkhana came out and thinking how is that even possible. And now we have electric cars and doing it is crazy. Really sucks that we lost such amazing guy would of loved to see what he would of done and accomplish the next 20 years. You will forever be missed Ken. R.I.P

lots of people can croak just running across the street, 100's of miles an hour for hours. but its funny when a recruit gets told to chase em in a public field exam, get the speeder = cant get the speeder. cant run anywhere in a communist republic, everything so finely set out as if someone had to scrub the rubber marks off after? as if a mile there comes back as 100 yards that's 50 short, they themselves don't do that or anything close do they? deeply conquered Spanish consult, one to do what as a job just to a ford lunch? that... is still their, dirt ring around of roam. "the farm Bulls hear a loud V8 as a dinner bell that drops off a grass bail", too a pandemonium of mirrors blinding an already hot day.
Brought tears to my eyes
Man ima miss these.. Rest In Peace brother, we miss you tons. #KB43VER
So sad when i am thinking that this is his last drifting. Rip man❤
His legacy still there, he will always be missed, the artist of AWD drifting!!! #KB43VER
Is beatiful
YouTube and Motorsport will forever be changed. Much love and respect for Ken, the Blocks and Hoonigan. 💔💪🏽🔥
OBG por tudo ken, vc fez historia e impactou muitas pessoas com seu talento e de toda equipe hoonigan pra sempre em nossas memorias!!!
This is a brilliant tribute to the man, the myth, the legend! Ken Block!!
Such a shame it wasn’t a v8
It's so good to see Ken Block drifting again, but it's so sad knowing that this is the last film we will see from such an amazing driver/person. We will always miss him. KB43ver
Grande juca
This is some 2pac 💩 gone an still making content😂 all jokes aside this was amazing an sad all rolled into one hard to think this legend is gone but his legacy lives on🙏KB4ever
Epic, but also sad
Somebody please... find who became the next Gymkhana driver next year... 😢
🫡💯🇺🇸♾️🙏🏼🫶🏼 The Legend #KB43VER
Que chulo video
The legend... Ken Block.❤💪🏽 #KB43ver
Thank you ken thank you hoonigan...even scumbags have hearts
❤❤
Truly an innovator in our sport! Absolutely a blast to be around! Appreciate your advice in my early days Rallying and always loved your involvement in the growth in American rally! Could always tell the huge impact having him around at the events was! Huge turnouts to watch a master at work! And what an awesome guy to all fans. Will miss you always Ken #kb43ver
THE MAN HIMSELF! FROM THE MF GRAVE! I pray to the DriftGod
rip legend
Let's go Tesla. Take it as a real opponent and not a Porsche gasoline 😊
I love cars BUT I truly could not care less about drifting that being said this is pretty NASTY...RIP KB
You're in our hearts forever Ken!
We are all gonna miss watching Ken do his thing. A lot of us grew up watching Gymkhana. I know it helped solidify my passion for everything automotive and always challenged what I thought was possible. #KB43VER
Going to really miss Ken doing these. But all good things must come to an end. Unfortunately the end came sooner than we expected.
The air feels so heavy when watching this video. Remembering when I learned about him and lookibg up his Hollywood video back in the early 2010's. Taken too soon. I'll miss him but he has forever left a 43 Ken Block mark on my soul. #KB43VER
#KB43VER
Gone but not forgotten 💖. #KB43ER
Rest in peace Ken Block, my Idol❤️❤️
No, he's not gone...  He just watch us from the better place...
Strange vibe, just like the times we live in and the EV controversy; great driving from Ken as always but doesnt even come close to the previous versions with fossil powered vehicles.
Mesmerising as usual
You know… I’m tearing up over this last ride… I looked up this man, no, this LEGEND, basically my whole life. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t have gotten into cars, DiRT, NASCAR or the world of Rally as a whole honestly. I remember all the times in 5th grade we’d put on his Gymkhana videos for everyone to watch with roughly 10 mins left in class. (I’m now wrapping up my first semester of college so that shows how long I’ve been watching this legend) I wish I could’ve met him in person but just knowing the fact that he did what he loved most is satisfaction. We will all miss you Ken, I hope you keep doing what you love up there.  #KB43VER
RIP A LEGEND!
It’s pretty incredible that human nature is such that a credit roll of footage can bring a tear to your eye for all the incredible things someone gave the world and yet so quickly and unexpectedly they’re now gone.  RIP 43
The best to ever do it.  #43
"If in doubt, flat out." -Colin McRae
Так он же сдох?
Just awesome❤
My guy was really just out here living his best life, #KB43ver
An inspiration to all. The reason I got into cars and rally. You lived like a legend and nothing held you back, everyone can strive to live there life as full as you did. Thank you for all that you gave me and the community. Amazing video <3
what's going to happen with the Amazon series?
Rip
KB43
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Hell of a ride! Gave it every thang. #KB43VER
Rest in peace Ken. We all thank you ❤ #43
Amazing and glad it’s been shown Ken will be missed and loved always. Made some amazing cars along the way…!
Rest In Peace good sir.
You just don't want it to end.  So very thankful Ken left us one last banger! Hoon in peace and Don't Slow Down!
Im definitely not a ev person but when Ken Block is ripping it, I don't think anybody would mind listening to that electric slide!! R.I.P. HOONIKING #43
Im crying at work. Ken shaped the automotive workd we love in today. Rip
Legend😮‍💨🔥🔥🔥
So inspiring ❤
Beyond....Remembered...Forever
While I absolutely abhor the electric motor, that Audi looks sleek af. RIP to the tyre slayer KB43
R.I.P Ken
Gonna miss seeing him tear up cities… rip legend. 😥 #KB43VER
43 FOREVERR😪😪🔥🇨🇱
Nah he is just jocking. He is still alive... In a few years he will jumpscare us :)
For someone who grew up watching him doing all that, it was tough to watch this one, rest in peace Ken, you will be forever remembered as the legendary driver you were 😢
Thanks to everyone so much, I / we all miss Ken so much, he will always and forever be a Legend.
It’s a cool video with an unbelievable driver but electric cars just aren’t as visceral as combustion engines. RIP Ken
Although It is another AMAZING example of how Ken was the BEST driver of all time, I watched it with sadness, knowing that he's gone!  Thank you for releasing this and putting another HUGE SMILE on my face as I watched it!! RIP #KB43VER
Hoon Responsibly in remembrance of KB.   Truly sad this will be the last one… What a GREAT run tho!!
You will be the absolute legend for Serious Fun. Long Live Ken Block.
i hope Lia is going to be as great...
The smirk on his face at 0:53 was so fkn cool
When you pilot a RC car 1:1
Rip ken ❤
@jucaviapri que orgullo hermanooo
got a little choked up during the last montage.  over the last 10 years ive enjoyed many hours of watching Ken  Block "doing what we all wish we could do".
We miss you ken😢
RIP Ken. So long and thanks for all the shoes.
❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢 rip ken remember my first gym khana was with rob man is been a far way
RIP to one of the greatest to ever sit behind a steering wheel! You will truly be missed Ken.❤
Rip ken, legend
❤
Absolute legend. But honestly, nothing will ever compare to his original Gymkhana 1 video.
gives the feel he never left at all   #KB43VER
ahh what time to be alive seeing this sort off thing
His laugh at the end really got me…it’s the last laugh we get from him.
The man R.I.P KEN BLOCK. Two things this car needs to be put on some super sticky slicks and be on This Verses That. And it would be cool if the car went to a Cleetus and Cars for the burnout contest
kind of hard to watch😢😢
Ken Block Legend! I wonder how many tire sets where spent filming this, that torque bro!
4:20 when he thinks he is about to curb slap is a great shot
Absolute legend rip
Rip KB! The last part was the best tho… miss the drama of the engine bangs and revs 😢 car is amazing… but its not all performance…
o7
KB43VER❤ Thank you hoonigan and rest in peace Ken Block!
Hell yeah, that was awesome!
That Car needs to be in a Museum along with the rest...  I need to be able to take my kids there so they can see where an entire lifestyle began. Ken was an Icon.  #Hoonigan4Life
El único dios de los autos, y bajo a la CDMX y de paso hasta Juca salió🎉
It ain't the same 😢RIP the goat
I miss the awesome sounds of the hoonicorn and hoonitruck
One of the coolest dudes ever.
Legends never die. RIP Ken.
el hombre que se convirtio en LEYENDA #KB43VER
🫡 later homie. Thanks for everything.
This was everything I’d hoped it’d be and so much more. That was one hell of last slide, I will forever miss ur energy and laugh Ken #KB43ver
The end to an epic saga of insane stunts and an incredible guy, #KB43VER
I also wanted to add another comment and give credit to Scotto and the team for all the hardwork and dedication to finish this project and get it out for us thank you for this early X-mas gift haha
Not going to say anything but I feel so sad 😭😭
Ken Block: the patron saint of hooning 💨 🚘
Thanks Ken for entertained me throughout these years. Can't forget how I felt watching the first Gymkhana video. #KB43VER
Thank you Ken, for being an inspiration for a whole generation of car enthusiasts!
RIP Ken Block, our legend. You will be remembered!  #KB43VER
R.I.P Ken and God bless your family
KB43VER! You will be greatly missed Ken!   I feel like the hoonigan team/Block family should try to reach out to Rockstar Games and get ken block appearing in random khana cars hooning aound GTA6, that'd be amazing! @rockstar where you at.
That little wave after his laugh at the end definitely hit me right in the feels! Happy I got to chat with the legend at SEMA 22! KB43VER!
Outro So epish r.i.p best mann
R.I.P Ken Block The best freestyle driver ever
Rest in peace brother👊
❤❤❤❤❤❤ KB43VER ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tu nous manques Ken j’espère que tu repose en paix tu resteras à jamais dans nos cœur tu sera toujours mon idole je suis triste de n’avoir pas pu de rencontrer 😢
4:20 me 18 years Old. Drift with Handbreak and Crash the wall. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
R.I.P Ken, You're missed!
The moment he closed his eyes because he thought he was going to hit that curb but kept his foot in it anyways!
RIP Ken, your impact on the game with never be forgotten #KB43VER 🕊❤
what a legend #kb43ver
Miss you everyday Ken 🤍
I never expected Juca to appear on Gymkhana, but it's a nice detail.  You'll never be forgotten, you're my inspiration to be better. Thank you, Ken.
the sound of electric trains can never compare with the roar of a motor
We Love you Ken Block ❤😮🕊️
0.52 you ready Ken eyes lock in  ...READY RIP LEGEND
Rest in Paradise, you beast.
KB43VER
KB43VER♥️🇺🇸
🫡
Those last 3.5 minutes really hit hard, what a ride it was, for all of us.  KB43ver
Thanks Hoonigan you made my day, Ken will never be forgotten #KB43VER
4:19 How he anticipated the impact but it didnt happen. Audi Quattro ftw
Still banging gear’s and pulling hand breaks where ever he might be❤ rip big brother
RIP the fuckin GOAT
Still not believing that Ken left us for almost a year. The outro rewinds all iconic Gymkhana moments that reminds me of the first time I discover him on YouTube.
I have seen some of the most exciting and crazy driving come from Ken. Yet some how Electric is boring.. Long live the Hoonicorn.
This car wery powerfull, sound level 0, RIP Block!
Incroyable la vidéo,  tu nous manque même de l'autre côté de l'Amérique.
Ken block You Always be a Big legend and My inspirations in make crazy thinks in cars rest in peace #KB43VER
We are going to miss you so much Ken, we love you from the depths of our hearts ❤ #KB43VER
❤❤❤KB43VER ❤❤❤ We will never forget you, I will never forget you!!!!  Big kiss to all the hoonigans   #KB43VER
If heaven is real I Hope this words reach you Ken we ALL miss you and your amazing job with your crew, friends and family Will never be forgotten #KB43ver
Insane ...Like Only Ken could do.He'll be missed 43ver...but never forgotten. #43ver #kenblock
I'm crying and I'm not hiding it. You'll forever be missed Ken
Once a Hoonigam always a Hoonigan. Forever in our hearts Ken ❤❤❤
What an outstanding outro to the beautiful, wonderful, and downright incredible story of the Gymkhana series and the man behind it all. Massive thank you to all of you at @Hoonigan for not only filming and producing, but for putting this out there for all of us to cherish and enjoy. Ken touched the lives of countless humans around the globe over his years. I never would have gotten into cars had I not watched Ken ripping shit up in the 2005 STI in Gymkhana 1 and his early rally days. Never would have been into Subarus period! Ooooh man did the outro sequence get my tear ducts going. To say it has been a journey would be a massive understatement, and words cant describe how thankful I am that we got to exist in the same era as this badass madman. Keep ripping away up there in the clouds Ken, we miss you like hell! <3 #KB43VER
We all miss you Ken , thanks for this Video Hoonigan ,it was heavy to watch❤❤  #KB43VER
KB43ver !
Ken Block was one of a kind 🔥🔥🔥
Ken block forever may the legend rest in peace we shall miss you
Mechanical sympathy, not even once.
REST IN PEACE LEGEND
Miss him.  He always brought smiles.
Ken Block <3
Not even going to watch. I can't let the last thing I see from Ken, be in a POS electric car.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The man who made me love the cars, this is so sad… #KB43VER
If this didn’t make you tear up, you have no soul. The world misses you KEN. Thanks for one more ride.
Wheelpros ruined hoonigan and Ken is rolling in his grave.
Rip 🎉LEGENDE🎉
В чем прикол на электричке ездить !?
Con dolor en el corazón, se extraña el 43, Ken por siempre 🔥🙌🏾
NOBODY will replace this legend!  Unless maybe Lia Block....no pressure Lia 😎
Honestly what a treat this video is. Rest in peace Mr block!!
RIP Ken......
Rest in Peace legend 🕊🕊🕊
Love how this one has a much higher focus on shots of Ken driving.
Forever in our hearts and minds. Love you brother!!
Rest in Power Ken
a true hero never dies!!!
Thank you Ken you’ll be missed. #KB43VER
No one will compare to what this man has done and he deserves all of the respect he can get. Put himself in many dangerous situations and did not feel a single bit of fear ❤❤❤
I didn't think today (my daughters 5th Birthday) could get any better - and then I get on the computer and see this! Thank you for making today even more awesome and allowing us to experience this with Ken one last time. Looking forward to seeing the legacy continue with Lia! #KB43VER
Is he downshifting an electric car with the paddle shifters at 5:32??
The best driver in the world! Rip legend  🕊
Wow man I remember when I first saw Ken block and Gymkhana when I was a kid now I’m 23 this makes me cry man what an inspiration legend forever 🤙🏻❤️
#KB43VER
This was really hard to watch I seen all the Gymkhana videos from the beginning. Still hard to believe Ken is gone it feels like yesterday prayer’s to the Block family and the Hoonigan family. #KB43VER
This is GREAT, never had the pleasure to meet Ken but this made my morning #KB43VER
rest easy big guy. know you're ripping around redlining going sideways on the track upstairs.
Respect and Love for Ken Block and family.
Damn. This video was so good, that for a moment  i nearly forgot ken isn't with us anymore. Those credits with all the flashbacks hit hard after that. This man was so awesome! Ken had and still has a huge influence on my life and on how i want to live it.  KB43VER!
It was and will forever be a reference for my generation. It was a very early departure, but his legacy will not be lost. He will only die, when the last person remembers who remembers him will die  #KB43VER ♥♥♥♥
Legends never die!
I hate to leave a bad comment about KB's last khana video but honestly without engine noises this is boring. He was an absolute unit and one of the people that really brought attention to rally racing in America. He is dearly missed and one of the few "celebrities" that i would lose a tear over. Not only was he an amazing driver that continued to impress but he was a family man and so down to earth. glad I got to fist bump him and say hello at Sno Drift rally in 2016, he will always be missed.  To Hoonigan yall need to bring back engines and ditch the electric because it just is boring to listen to, put Lia in there, she can do it. She is becoming a great driver and knows has to commit to driving race cars or they dont drive right. Pikes Peak Porsche showed us all that, give her the Reins she can do this and it will only make her better. start with tribute with one of his old subies or fiestas and do a Gymkhana with Lia and Pastrana, hell get the entire gang back together at least once.
What A Finale 🎉 RiP #KB43 ❤
A master at his craft that he so happened to invent, a legend, an idol, a man of few words but many actions that has impacted the lives of many. I feel lucky that I simply had the opportunity to watch. Thank you Scotto for what you helped create and the block family for sharing him with us.        #KB43VER
They should have used v8 noises 😅
Long live the legend 🙏  #KB43VER
R.I.P drift king 🫡
Thank you+++&🤟🤟🐿🙊🙉🙈
If its ever a cloudy day, its probably just KB up there hooning around. :) Rest easy, legend.  #KB43VER
EPIC VIDEO BLOCK 4EVER❤️🇲🇽
RIP to a GOAT!
Yet another automotive legend that has left waaaayyyyyyy toooooo soon. And another automotive legend for us too look up too aswell. R.I.P Ken, you will always be remembered! #KB43VER
RIP Ken. Thank you Hoonigan for keeping his legacy alive.
When you get the squint and flinch from Ken you know that was close at 4:20…rip to a legend
RIP KB forever ❣️
Man.  Ken and Team were really just starting to unlock the power and cool shit that could be done with the power from electric vehicles.  The passing of Ken is a huge loss for motorsports, and just creativity in general.
Horrible this last one will be a stane on his legacy
You are missed.
EVs are just big expensive toys for wealthy people at least the good ones are, completely impractical and destructive far more than a combustion engine. But ken could make anything awesome.
R.I.P
The hero of most of my childhood ! #KB43VER
Descansa en paz 🕊️ siempre te recordaremos ❤ y del vídeo lo único que no me gusta nada que el coche es eléctrico 😞😞
Legends never die man 😢😢😢😢 absolutely loved kens cars and stunts he preformed… rest easy ken you’ll be in all our memories forever
Ken was the reason why I bought an i30 and got into rallye, can never be more grateful for the smiles he brought me
Presses F
the way his eyes changed after he chuckled and said i’m ready… we’ll miss you
Eletric cars are pathetic
The Legend!
The level of precision driving Ken had was unmatched. I am glad to see he was doing what he loved right up to the end. #KB43ver
I always wondered how it would feel, for some British people when the queen dies. When I first heard the news, I knew. This was genuinely the first time I cried because of somebody I've never met. You never know you miss someone until they're gone.   Thank you for 11 minutes and 36 seconds of Ken.  Thank you for 11 minutes and 36 seconds of Hoonigan. Thank you for sharing your passion.  Thanks to the Team at Hoonigan and everyone else involved for making this happen. Thank you for everything.   I hope you never stop.  #KB43ver   PS: Video was blurry the whole time, maybe upgrade your cameras ;) PPS: Tissues can fix it !
Es hermoso poder ver el ultimo video del 43❤
Swear he’s the only one that makes a car defy physics
He never failed to in the WOW factor!  Incredible skill/talent. What an amazing person, we were blessed to have him in our lives.   ❤ 43 ❤
beautiful way to close the legacy I left
❤❤ fuck man a proper send off to hoonigan.
Que increíble que el último video de LA LEYENDA sea grabado en las calles que recorremos día a día! Y que salga JUCA es una locuuuuuraa!!! Animo compadre 🔥🔥🔥🔥
RIP KB!! Was that top speed accurate- 204MPH? It was at the 5:15 mark.
Rest in Peace, Ken Block. You'll be missed. #KB43er
Todo estaba bien hasta que salió Juca en su puesto de tacos
Watched this with ❤ and 😢.
Hasta siempre Ken 🇪🇦❤esto ha sido tu mejor regalo
Still Gymkhana-ing in Heaven! #AINTCARE #KB43VER
56 Dislikes at least we know how many Prius drivers watch this. #kb43ver
The OG gymkhana videos are why im into cars today #KB4or3ver
<3 My man!
*for Ken* ❤
#KB43VER
The year flew by.. R.I.P. KB #43
God I love that man.
#KB43VER
Wow…I miss Ken.  His humor, skill, and the way he grimaced in a couple of critical transitions as he was expecting he was going to have a hard contact are priceless.  It’s a hard act to follow, but I will be cheering if/when LiaKhana I debuts. KB4ever!
How many cameras get destroyed on a shoot like this? It sounds so different without the symphony of liquid fuel powered orchestra. Tire A cappella.
Akhir gymkhana dari ken block. Terima kasih ken block sudah membuat dunia otomotif menjadi tertarik karena berkat dirimu dan terima kasih hoonigan dan semuanya. Terima kasih ken block kami merindukanmu😢.  #KB43VER
Beautiful, a work of art. I miss you Ken ❤
LEGENDS NEVER DIE! KEN43VER!
Another epic video 👌, #kb43
Ken, thank you for the on the edge entertainment. I put side-by-side to Colin McRae. Big love to the Block Family and Friends. Your Daughter has your blood, so the Block name can live on. Miss you 😔
❤
Ken immortal❤43
RIP Ken <3 a true hero to us
Legends never die - #KB43VER ❤

This hits hard, thanks Hoons. KB43VER.
Of course, the last video he asked to make is a dam electric car, and even worse an Audi
Toast to a legend and the legacy that he carries!
WE LOVE KEN BLOCK !! 43!! #KB43VER
THE CREW MOTORFEST ❤ HOONIGAN
RIP Legend! Master of The Wheel #KB43VER
Never will there be a day where your forgotten ken. You did more in your life than 10 men with their 10 lives combined. #KB43VER
Thankyou for the memories Ken. Much love your family.
Still to these days people who’s live near o rings streets there, still hearing screaming tires with monster revving electro engine in early morning and when they go to work still burnd marks of tires in streets…..anyone know the reason?❤
Beauty
#KB43Ver❤
electric sucks, give me back the petrol engines
I just want to cry watching this
not watched it yet because i know it'll be hard knowing he's gone.
Miss Ken as much as I miss the car sound. #KB43ever
So that electric car has gears???
Seeing another gymkhana by Ken Block brings so much joy to me and probably alot of people here to.  Long Live Ken Block.
REST IN PEACE YOU LEGENDARY GOAT
I’m glad this footage exists he was a true legend and will always be remembered and this gives us a piece of him thanks hoonigan #kb43ver
JUCA!! eso si es un crossover! el mejor en la historia del anime!
#KB43VER
Started watching Gymkhana in 2018 and it’s been a blast seeing everything Ken and Hoonigan did during these 5 years. I Miss seeing Ken’s posts everyday. Rest in Peace Ken Block. And you thank you for all you’ve done for this community
When it first happened one of the first things I did was order a #43 sticker. The second it came in I put it on my truck. I may never be as amazing at driving as he is but I sure want to at least give him a small memorial piece on my truck. KB43VER
Damn, I miss this guy.
McRea, Senna, Schumacher,  Leob, and Ken Block these are my personal driving hero's (no order). In his own right based on his own interest Ken made a name for himself as a trail blazer. The mark of a man is not how the followed but how they led. #RIPKB
Hoonitron weighs in at a reported 3600#. Hoonicorn 3000#. Is the Hoonitron the heaviest car Ken featured?
first time seeing an all wheel drive burnout
#KB43VER
I've never clicked on a video faster. Ken you were an inspiration for so many including myself. May your legacy live on #43ever
Rest in peace,thank you for giving us one last ride
I sure miss hearing that laugh of Ken’s. Still tears me up when I see anything with Ken in it. Truly lost one of the greatest people when we lost him. Rest in peace legend! #KB43VER!
E-TRON OR HOONICORN  What one are you taking?
😲Wheels spinning in opposite directions for AWD burnout was nice idea. Did anyone notice it?🤔 #kb43ver
The part where he said "so we can be done" hit pretty hard for me. I'm glad you guys showed all the previous Gymkhanas afterwards. It brought back some great memories of the old days and made me remember why Ken's life should be celebrated. It's a case of "don't be sad that it has ended. Be glad that it happened."
Thank you 🫶🏼
Beau Travail comme d'habitude🔬🔥🗽💪🎬🙏🌌
Sick
I hope Lia will make videos like this one day! Ken, thank you for everything you did!
Ken Block and Hoonicorn will be for ever the icon in all motorsport. He will be deeply missed
I miss you a lot Ken. Growing up I had no one to look up to and no idea where I wanted to go in life. You should me that by being myself and doing what I love I can live an amazing life. You weren’t just a race car driver to me, you were and always will be an idol and role model in my heart. #KB43VER ❤️
Rest well champ❤️
ความบ้าระห่ำไม่มีเทียบเขาคนนี้ได้ Ken block43❤

Thank you Ken Block, may you rest in peace It’s been a pleasure knowing you
Ken was an amazing guy
Thank u for everything
Don't slow down!!!
#KB43VER❤
Ken Block will NEVER be forgotten, a LEGEND in his own right! He pushed the limits and now he is in HEAVEN w/ our Savior! Ken Block #43EVER!❤🕊
I want to see full gymkhana 1 in HD
4or3ver
Rest in Peace Ken. Gymkhana 43 Life!
What an inspiration  😢. The legend of legends💔💔
💚
Nothing but love for the legend. May his legacy live on forever.
Nothing but chills when Ken came into frame. We miss you so much, RIP Legend. KB43VR 🤙🏼
thank you ken for the wild rides <3
Damn, I am not crying. You are crying!!!  Ken was THE reason I got in to anything off-road or rally.   Thanks for an awesome video.
Hell yeah,,,rip Brother !
Pretty cool video. Have to be honest though least impressive out of all of them. Not saying it’s crap not at all just not as crazy but that’s all good. Sorry to say that never be another video of Ken driving. Don’t know if his daughter will be as good and I hope she doesn’t get pushed too fast by anyone to do crazy stuff that could get her hurt. Hoonigan is different now for sure after people leaving but still great content. Thanks for many years of smiles and inspiration.
First time I was truly sad to watch one. RIPKB43 !
And I’m crying
Who cut the onions 🥹
The very first gymkhana was my introduction to Ken Block. 🙏🙏💕 Can't believe hes gone from this world already. Peace, love, respect
Only Ken can make me like an electric car🖤
I thought he was dead where do they ceep getting the videos
badly missed , from Dublin
Omg man words can't describe how it feels to lose an absolutely legendary person in this world like ken. RIP you will be missed and forever remembered ❤️
I miss Ken, but man do these electric cars blow. Name one this that car did cooler, than another of the other badass real cars in the past.
Had a lump in my throat watching that such a special person.
😢
And somebody said hoonigan was dead hoonigan for life. ❤ Toyota Corolla GR ❤️
#KB43VER
Amazing driving and camera work.  I hope Ken is watching down on us, knowing that we will miss him terribly.
thank you bro <3
I love it!...EXCEPT for the electric drivetrain.  I much prefer the sounds of a gasoline engine.  Yeah, I know nobody asked.  THIS car sounds like a very long and intense root canal at the dentist.  Hahaa.  RIP to Ken Block though!  ☹️
Yah never think it's going to happen till it does live your life well and enjoy it cause you never know when your time is up
KEN fucken Block, missed but damn sho not forgotten.  LLKB
Crazy to think that KB is gone, this was such a fun and unexpected collaboration, so props to Audi for making a fun a rad looking thing.
Ken Block will always be missed. He's the reason I'm into cars and rally. Hoon in heaven ken. KB43ver.
a very touching ending!  awesome video!
#KB43VER
thats insane
RIP. KB43VER
may he rest in peace
As a kid i use to sit back and watch the gymkhana series in utter shock wondering how Ken was able to do the things he did with his vehicles. He was and always will be my biggest inspiration and driving hero. Thanks Ken and the OG hoonigan team for all the great memories. Sad times.
#KB43ver  We miss you so much sir.  Before you, we didn't even know what it was to "HOON" yet now I am a HOONIGAN for life!!!! WE WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER!!!!
I’m convinced this is just a RC car the way it sounds 😂
❤
#KB43VER  This is officially the last video a watch as a subcriber to Hoonigan. RIP KEN BLOCK 43
Rip legend 🙏
You will always be my idol. R.I.P 43!
It’s like playing GTA with it on mute 🔇
Thank you!!!!!
it’s cool how they close roads so Ken can cruise around
I believe it was awesome but I can't be sure bc I was fkn crying the whole damn time R.I.P KB 43ver
Great to see him again but sadly you can see it had became just another job to him by this point! Watch any of the others hes smiling and laughing this one its nothing but serious until he got to the airport!
The end of a Legacy.
😭😭😭
One of the greatest driving legends to ever do it! You’ll be missed Ken
After looking at his old famiky photos, it looked like he had a son ? But,, it says he had 3 daughters.
wish all the best to his daughter
Thank you
Thank you Ken.
Barely a minute in, and I'm already choked with emotions of joyful sadness. You will be forever missed and never forgotten, Mr. Block. ❤
Legendary
RIP Ken block. You are missed by all of us who love what you showed us you can do in a car
The late great Ken himself will be forever in our memory 🙂 ---------- KB43ver
Rest in peace, Ken, thank you for everything over the years, there may not be anyone like you ever #KB43
The electric symphony hits differently now 😢KB4EVR
rest in peace man
The guy that drives looking out of the side window. We miss you man.
#KB43VER
SUCH AN EPIC RIDE YOU ALWAYS SENT US ON KEN ! SUCH AN AMAZING MAN , LIFE AND LEGEND ! CANT WAIT TO SEE LIA DO HER THING IN THE YEARS TO COME !
What a legend!
ОН ЖЕ УМЕР КТО ЕГО ПРОДОЛЖАЕТ ПРИЗЫВАТЬ???
The greatest to ever do it. Thank you KB
I'm a simple man. I see "electric" I click don't recommend
Крутой был мужик, вечная память
RIP CHAMP🥺
Props to the Shreditors and the Hgn team putting this together. Can't have been an easy job.
wow
Please give us behind the scenes
Rest in peace man...
Thank you KB43
what a great tribute
Rip 😢
Thanks for the last joy ride! It's been a good time.
Will for ever miss this guy and his out of this world talent. Ken is an absolute legend and Mia will carry the legacy. Love his face at 4:20 bracing for the hit, but it did not. Literally watched this video several times. And funny thing when I first saw Ken around 2008 and before, I was like "Who is this Shaggy Rogers" and turned out to be one of the best drivers in history.
43 seconds in and im breaking down, you were an amazing inspiration to me Ken and that will never stop. 43ver
KB4EVER this brought a tear to my eye. You will always be missed, but will always live on in these videos, KB.
I’ve watched these since the first one… hope Lia picks up these now…would be great
I’m not crying I’m not crying I’m not crying
Wheels up🙏
5:00 sounds absolutely wild. Fighter Jet
Even tho everyone knows him for hoonigan here. My man behind the wheel has done more for skateboarding than people think. Absolutely pioneered modern skate shoes.
Thanks Ken for blowing our minds, you will be missed .
Love. KB43VER! Man, that Hoonitron does make some cool sounds. And did you really get to shut down a terminal at an international airport!?
WoWWwwwwwww.................
Doesn't fell real .. RIP KB43 💨💨💚💚💚
Legend
What a driver! Rip!
Ken you were one of a kind and will be so greatly missed.
hale the GOAT🐐
KB sure knew how to burn rubber....what a legend, he'll be greatly missed❤️❤️❤️
Gracias Ken por contagearnos esa alegria de amar lo que a uno nos hace feliz! Gracias por todo hermano! Saludos al mas haya, espero que haya arriba te esten difrutando como nosotros lo hicimos en videos y otros en vida! #PorSiempreKENBLOCK
Ken always pushed the Limits! He was truly one of the Masters in Automotive Sport RIP Legend 👌
absolute legend
The last Hurrah! what a legend! missed forever.. and the rest of hoonigan aswell, actual legends!
o7
Building janitory must be happy ahah 😜 05:49 - RIP Mr Block...
This was extremely bittersweet to watch.
#KB43VER ❤
Speechless #KB43VER
RIP to one if the greatest entertainers ever in the car industry, no one can do what he could do. Well other than his daughter
Ken Block defined hooning. He advocated for safety and to also be kind to each other. I never met the man yet am inspired by who he was and what he left behind. #KB43VER
RIP Ken, nobody can drift it like you.
🖤🖤🖤 #43VER 🚀
The amount of tears I have coming down my face while watching this is pure sadness and pain 😭😭😭
Ken Block's Легенда с большой буквы! Навсегда в мире соженной резины и рёва мотора и (в данном видео - не рёва), это бесконечный крутящий момент в кровеносных сосудах и мастер рулевого управления! покойся с миром Легенда! Лучший! p.s. покажи им там, что такое настоящее управление машиной!!!
We miss him a lot
Schön das noch content vom Ehrenmann kommt ❤️ Gott hab ihn selig 👃 Ohne Motor Geräusche kommt es irgendwie nicht so geil das gefiepse 😅
[*]
R I P KB!! My favorite/best one is the San Fran Gymkhana!!
So thankful to have grown up with Ken and the team putting these out! #KB43er
THANK YOU KEN❤❤❤
It’s hard to believe he’s really gone
One last dance, Ken. One last dance :(... #KB43VER
In my memory forever, thanks ken.
Kb43ver!!!!!!
生きてて欲しかったなあ
That was amazing videos  amazing Ken thank a lot!!!
RIP Ken, you’ve been nothing but an inspiration to tons of enthusiasts all over the world. Big props to the team of people and Scotto for always doing a bang up job on these. KB43ver ❤
RIP Ken
I can only imagine how hard it is for his daughter and wife to see these posted. Im sure they gave permission ofc but it still must be hard. I hope they go through these comments and see how much of an impact he had on the world and how much we miss him. Rest easy ken❤️
El mejor uso que se la ha podido dar al AIFA. Thank you for turning every city into a playground for all of us to enjoy, Ken! #KB43VER
R.I.P to the legend.
You will be forever missed 👑🕊 #KB43VER
Right on my birthday
Thanks for everything Ken .You can rest in peace #KB43VER❤❤❤
Epic !...what a Legend.  So sadly missed but never to be forgotten👏
I still miss hearing that laugh..... KB43ver❤💔
Driving is outstanding but sure miss the noise.
Watched this before I even brushed my teeth. Ken was a gift, and the car industry has a void that I’m going to fill. LLKB43
KB43ER <3
#kb43ver
#KB43EVR
Wow, look at all the young faces there at the end.
It is very painful but it brings much more happiness to hear that laugh one last time 😓
Ken will live forever in our hearts!!
Most inspiring man ever.
Thank you for all the memories, Ken.
Question about the hoonitron. Does it actually sound like that when it drives or do you have it the electric engine sounds boosted with a mic.
sorry i cant watch it fully because it still hurts ,Ken was my childhood hero, his videos is what make me a petrol head , but i love this one last ride with Ken Block , May he rest in peace and his spirit and dreams lives on!  #KB43VER
he's changed the car culture 43ever 🖤
While it may be a sad, I'm glad i've been around to see Ken's last thrash. I'll miss that man, but what he represents will never be forgotten #KB43VER  Hell, maybe in a couple years time there might be another block that's willing to throw her hat into the ring (if she wants to of course!)
Amazing Car, Driven by an Amazing Legend of a Driver, but with IMO a vile obnoxious sound of the future, Give me a NA V8 or V12 soundtrack any day lol. RIP Mr Block. Your legend will live on forever.
Every single one of these are timeless 🔥
Another banger by the LEGEND. ❤
Thank you Scotto and everyone at Hoonigan for giving us the closure that we all needed.
Zero, F8cKs given for that Audi!  Dude is a Legend!! R.I.P. Ken! you are truly missed!!
*KB43VER*
Thank you ❤ KB43ver.
KB 43 FOREVER
❤💔🍾
Hands down the best driver that ever wheeled a car now your daughter is continuing you legacy KB43VER
I just gave a small tribute to Ken yesterday at work, just to push me through my shift for the day. It hurts to watch this but, man. I sure miss the sounds of tires squealing and Ken's "Send it" mentality. #KB43  You will always be in our hearts and an inspiration to all. Including me.
Ken block 43eva ❤❤❤
Well worth the wait. God I miss this man.
4:40 Turn left to go right!! 43 is the best to ever do it! #kb43ver
Even after passing he gives the world what they want. The world loves you Ken KB43VER❤
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😞😞🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
He make me fall in love with this sport
❤block Kb43ver
I got goosebumps watching this. 2014 in downtown las Angeles will always be my favorite
This made my day to see a new Ken Block video, RIP.
Love it!🔥‼️
RIP Ken. One last ride.
Thanks to Ken and everybody at Hoonigan. Rest In Power Mr. Block.✌️
I'm not crying you are.......
Shutting down the airport is insane
I never personally knew the legend but damn do I miss him
Only man to make us want to drive an electric car. #KB43er
As someone who was massively inspired by Gymkhana as a young dude it is a very strange feeling to now watch the last new Gymkhana from Ken. Without ever meeting him I still find it very strange that his passing is still giving me such a sad feeling. He truly showed a lot of young people what freedom, fun and going for your passions can mean especially for a car loving subject. Ok so lets hit the play button for the first time, a last time.....KB43ver
I love how he was preparing for impact and closed his eyes while drifting the car into a corner
Will forever remember him as one of if not the best professional driver of all time. Big RIP to this dude
#juca 👀💯🔥‼️👏🏼
Eterna Lenda!! ❤❤❤❤❤  🇧🇷
RIP KEN WHAT A FUCKING BEAST
R.i.p. Block, electryshitty car sucks
Great video!  Thanks!
Ken block was one of the people that made me fall in love with cars. There will be no other to ever be as crazy as him.
Audi S1 Hoonitron vs. Cybertruck three motor...yes, the Audi would win - but Elon's just vain enough to send one to try his luck...The Audi S1 Hoonitron sounds like my dentist working on a molar.
😢
sad that he didn,t see GTA 6 coming
miss u ken
That was amazing to see RIP KB43ver
From indonesian, I love you, I miss you, miss all your action, voice, even your laugh...  Drift Peacefully, send my love to all legends in heaven❤️❤️❤️❤️🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩   #KB43VER
Ken will forever be a legend n I will never forget this man. Since his 1st video in the subie  I've watched every single Gymkana  Reast easy Ken, always been a sick ass driver
Ken Block RIPARADISE Legend
Man, this is so hard but I'm glad we have this to be able to watch ❤
Oh boy! Another amazing piece of video motorsports art and incredible scenery - shit down an airport why dontcha?!  We’re all missing him but of course not as much as his family and the Hoonigan team.  Farewell KB43VER.
What an absolute hommage RIP Ken 43ver
Awesome video guys, Ken looking better than ever
It feels so surreal watching this after his death. If you guys continue to do Gymkhanas, then I can't imagine how big Ken's shoes are (probably size 12 after everything he's done 🤔) to fill. But whether that be Lia, Pastrana, or someone else, I have faith that you guys will pick someone who will Hoon just like Ken, and maybe even add a bit more. #KB43VER
Rest in peace, Ken.  Scott and Hoonigan team, thanks for putting this together❤️
Hi
It's good to see the Hoonitron drove like a car for the final send. It turned, slid, changed direction like it should! So thanks for the entertainment Ken! The world has gone a bit more gray without you!
What a beautiful, bittersweet video. That was a wonderful tribute to a great driver and amazing guy. #KB43VER
That was awesome! Miss that guy man
Such a beautiful way to end his legacy! Thank you for all the years of automotive artistry, you are the best Ken!!
Imagine if he had known this was going to be his last run.  ❤
pure epicness
Thank you for what you done with all theses amazing videos! It was always inspired for a lot of people with your talent and following the future steps for racing. You will always be missed. Legends never die! #KB43VER
A legend.
Had to watch it twice. Nicely done! ❤❤❤
RIP Ken Block you were a legend in the drifting Community we'll miss you so much and hope you're in a better place slaping those road sideway's we love you and thank you for everything you have bring us all those memories we never gonna forget them <3
RIP, you crazy bastard. o7
KB43VER
I'm so glad this got released, Ken was such a huge inspiration to so many of us, not just his driving but his personality too. We miss ya, bud. #KB43VER
What an absolute legend! Truly missed and never forgotten.
"I'm not crying.... you're crying." 😣
Merry Christmas!!  Best present ever!! Thanks Hoonigan Squad
What an absolute legend. 💙🚙💨
In tears
Legend 💚
KB43VER
Rest in peace legend.   You will be missed. 🙏🏼🕊️
Is that the airport from the OG COD MW2?
ART!
Ken block will always be missed and nobody I mean nobody could ever do this like he can this is the legend the master
good work all love #KB43VER
Ken,We all miss you a lot, and with the deepest respect I say, fly high friend and Thank you for inspiring me to be a car driver in the future, I hope I can do feats as great as your gymkhanas😢
#KB43VER
Thank you Ken, for inspiring many of us. Can't believe this will be your final Gymkhana video, but still never failed to amaze us. #KB43VER
What can I say 💯  savage legend  R.I.P KEN 😢
Rip ken block a true legend
❤
Thank you LEGEND #KB43EVER
Thank you KB43VR
A toast , to the good times since the first video miss you Ken.
Rip Ken you will always be missed and never forgotten. ❤
Car manufacturers should have had Ken Block drive there cars. After seeing that, I'm fully on-board  with electric cars now.
#KB43Ver R.I.P to an absolute fricking legend
I'm so glad you released this, can't think of a better tribute to Ken Block, what an absolute legend, may he rest in peace.
What a legend.  Amazing video, great montage. Thanks for all the inspiration and vehicular scares. #KB43ver
I'm always so amazed by his smile. He doesn't give a fuck. That smile dude,like he's doing a simple donut
I was not ready for it to end.
Great video and a legendary man! You wont be forgotten
Ken reignited my love for the rally sport and car culture again. May his legacy live on #KB43er ! ❤
There wasn't a better man for the job. Now, his daughter hopefully can replicate his awesomeness. A member of the Block family for life... utmost respect
Rip drift khana king 🙏 we miss you #KB43VER
Awsome footage!!, Iam still not an electric fan😂, I want the noise, the flames, the smell.
This was just fucking beautiful! ❤️ What a journey! So sad everything ended like this! KB43ver in my heart 🙏
So much of what I love today is a by product of Ken Block and these gymkhana videos! It’s such a heart breaking thing to known he’s no longer with us but I’m so incredibly thankful to have been able to witness everything Ken has accomplished on and off the track/streets. Love you Ken!! 💚 #Kb43ever
🙏  rip
This is so sad 😢 its the end of an era.
What a legend, he will always be remembered and always be missed
Legends never die #KB43er
I hope they add the Hoonitron S1 in CarX so we can honor him in the game
RIP 43 !!!! A lot of memories for me and my friends growing up sir. Fly high !
I need to say it again, but: R.I.P Ken Block... we will never forget you. All other Gym- or Electrikhana's were more of a "WOW" Experience to watch but this one is full with a "This still can't be true" kind of thinking......it's just sooo sad
Rest In Piece to a legend
now im happpy and sad, rest in peace Ken
This was amazing. The day Ken passed was just something that i couldn't come to terms with it just didn't seem really. Today watching this made me realize that he was always doing something that made him happy. I'm thankful i had the opportunity to meet and shake my heros hand. An amazing and down to earth person like a big kid at heart #kb43ver
The LEGEND ......R.I.P.
KB43 forever and always
Ken was awesome! What this man did to promote Motorsports is beyond incredible. You will be missed
Maybe when we're all dead and gone we'll get to see Ken ripping it up Gymkhana style up in the clouds. I'd dig to see what that video would ever look like. Miss you Ken.
Over the years, watching Ken's Hoonigan antics made me feel like a kid again, watching Evel Knievel in my pj's in front of the black & white tv. But Ken was SO much better, and wholesome to boot. Easily one of the most shocking losses in the world of sport/entertainment/culture in my lifetime. And here he is, bringing us yet more joy, making our day a bit better. #KB43VER
this new GTA6 looks very realistic
Oh, ACTUAL Mexico streets. Not the normal YouTuber “Mexico”.
#43ver
Still doesn’t feel real man.. #KB43VER
KB43VER a legend in my lifetime thank you for being the HHIC, forever missed.
Dang
Race in Peace, Ken. Great to see him drive one more time. I'd actually be so down for a Gymkhana documentary series where every episode is a minidoc + the run itself, I think that would be pretty cool!
Got me choked up bruh 🥺. There will never be another
RIP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhnUlpeFIOQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhnUlpeFIOQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhnUlpeFIOQ
Airport!?!! 😮
#KB43ver. May he rest in peace. ❤️ I hope his family is doing well. Along w you all here at Hoonigan & Monster. 🙏
Would’ve been cool if it was in hoonicorn. Kinda hate this car
That cringe face when he over shoot!!. 😂😂❤
KB43VER
rest in power legend
Not easy to watch.. Very happy Audi let them include the old clips without having to hind the ford logos. Amazing video with a perfect ending.
Tnx Ken ❤
The whole outro from 8:23 was really special. I remember how the first Gymkhana completely blew my mind at 17 years old. I'm sad that it's over, but I'm glad that it happened. One of a kind. Thanks Ken and Hoonigan.
#KB43EVER WE ALL MISS YOU KEN LOVE YOU BROTHER SLAY SOME TIRES UP THERE FOR US
Thank you Ken for all the inspiration you've given us.  You are loved and missed.  Thank you Hoonigan for keeping the dream alive.  Thank you Lia for building on your dad's legacy.  We are cheering for you and can't wait to see what the future holds. #KB43ver
Perfect😍
Cant do it 😢
KB43VER!
Thank you ❤
Epic!
I miss you and love you Ken. Thank you, and thank you Hoonigan. GOATs.
just cant image this being the last one. i watch videos of him hoonin around since i got my first computer
I will forever hold you in my memory Ken Block, me and many other guys looked up to you. Thank you for posting this Hoonigan.<3
Thanks for one last ride along, We miss you
pure beauty thank you for the crying fest
Still the best gymkhana car yet, wish he had more time in it...
Thanks team, rest in peace Ken!
Watching Ken unstrap himself for the final time gives me chills. We miss you, Ken.
Legacy
Good bumps when he does the backy on the bridge RIP KEN
يسوق بن اللذينا
5:13 imagine for a second flying through a straight t 130 MPH in a fully electric car
Ken will be forever missed. Although no engine sounds = YAWN
Rip Ken block Great video
Fue un honor
RIP Legend
rest in piece ken block, the man that changed the car scene for the better
Hard not to get a little choked up!
Oh thats a recording? i thought it was just a live stream of heaven for him.
Thank you 🙏🥲
🏆🏆 PARABÉNS NOBRE CAMPEÃO 🏆🏆
#KB43VER  Respect from Kiev Ukraine
Y’all need to make the part where it says takeovers are dumb longer, your targeted takeover audience can’t hardly read let alone read fast haha
Can't believe this is the last one 😢 RIP legend!! You'll be missed 43ver!! #KB43ver ❤
Man, this just made tear up, what a great showdown... We will never forget you Ken, thanks for always be an inspiration for millions of fans and an icon of motorsports, Hoon in peace 43, Legends never die #KB43VER
RIPKB43 #43ver
1 to 10 I give a 7
RIP Ken Block. Such a legend that will, no doubt, inspire future generations until the end of racing...so, FOREVER.  Or should I say #KB43VER
I hate to say it but not nearly as good as some of the old ones. Don't get me wrong I miss Ken too but every drift was crazy wide and was just about making tire smoke. That car probably cost way too much and they didn't wana damage it with actually crazy stunts. I get it but I woulda buried this film, not the best "Last Film". Idk just my 2 cents.
An absolute legend! What a ride, and one of the absolute greats! Love ya Ken! #KB43er
A grande Lenda
love for ken
#KB43VER ❤❤❤❤
This is sad just to think we will never have Ken again on this earth may you rest in peace you helped me through alot with these videos god bless everyone and stay safe 😊
KB43forever
❤❤❤RIP THE HOONIGOD❤❤❤
Man. I miss Ken. He showed us that motorsport can be fun.  Earth is a worse place now without him.
Garage kept, never seen rain
What a legend, you are truly missed.
He's been an inspiration to me and my build. The absolute G.O.A.T. He will forever be missed by all of us!
GTA 6 trailer yesterday. Now this??? This been a good week! RIP Ken we miss you!
#KB43vEr
Don't slow down!
I think an electric drift car is such h an awesome idea because first it sounds cool, and then because it is fully electric, it hs instant torque and acceleration
The Legend ! <3
🚗💨 KB43VER 💨💨💨 💚
@jucaviapri tu aparición fue increíble, grité como loco jajajaja
This is the last one with Ken, but it is still nice to see him sliding and burning rubber one more time. Just wish I don't slow down. #KB43er
KB43VER Not gonna lie I have been mixed about this, pretty emotional. I feel the presence loss still, see you everyday on my inspiration wall, the signed poster you handed me. Thank you Hoonigan, I know shyts changing but his, your legacy is cemented.
Ken Block for ever 43🫶🏻❤️
Amazing.. RIP Ken. A damn snowmobile did him in after everything he's done.. Sad. Missed.
In Block We Trust....Truly a legend lost!!! #KB43r 🙏
Often imitated, but never duplicated.  The YouTube OG, HHIC, GOAT...KB43VER 🙏
12 milly and quitest movie ken block ever made
Just....umm....ya know......WOW!!! 😳😳😳
We have to be so lucky that he was the only one make EV's look so damn cool, right before he died.
43ver <3
If this would be the last contect on this channel, it would be worthy to him. RIP Mr. Ken
What an absolute fucking monster. Hard to believe this is the last time Ken will grace us with his abilities. RIP KB43VER
RIP ❤❤❤😭
The end really hits hard!!!! Rip
Hit that like button
Thanks for the goose bumps and racing heart Ken and Brian. #KB43ER

Absolute SLAYER! Thank you for one last hoon, Ken. Rest in peace.
Thank you Mr.Block ❤❤#KB43VER
RIP Ken <3
Hoon in Peace, Ken. You will be missed. #KB43VER
There is some 3D rendering going on here, rite? Or am I just tripping.
His light has gone, but it still shines in everyone’s memories and hearts. R.I.P KEN
thanks ken
who is chopping all these onions...
That's it, I'm doing my own e car build inspired by electrikhana. This is by far the best and my absolute favorite video out of all Ken's videos! May he live on in our hearts and through history.
this is a perfect birthday present
My 5 year old son was Ken Block for Halloween. He said he wants to be him next year, too.
Legends never die🙏🤙
How do you get Mexico City so quiet!? Wow... It's bitter sweet watching this knowing he's gone. Gone, but never forgotten!
The Best. Super Star⭐ Super Man 😎✨
Its never a dull video with Ken and his amazing skill. I miss the noise of the hoonicorn but still spectacular.
beautiful
So good to see more stuff, and the outro montage was amazing.
As always, another inspirational video for the EV boys. I remember when I first saw the first Gymkhana video of the blue Subie. I was hooked. You will be missed and may you rest in peace Ken. Thanx for all the badazzery you’ve shown us. 🙏🏼
💚💚💚💚💚
ken forever. Now will Lia be the next to make her way in the Electrikhana?
#KB43VER
His killer videos will forever missed as well as him self we will forever miss you Ken 😭
Gymkhana >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Mexico Coty y’all need to leave those tire marks there.  Please release a behind the scenes video #Kb43ever
REST IN PEACE KEN
*Wow electric cars are boring.*
👊🏽🔥👍🏽
We miss you Ken. Thank you for everything. Although one thank you is not enough here.
oh man we will nwvwer forget those #43
Youre kidding they gave yall the new AIFA airport XDDD As a Mexican I knew that airport was dead as shit but goddamn, SO dead they agreed to close it for drifting? Thats crazy
Best tribiute that he coud get . Im so glad that I was growing up on his videos and lasted to my adulthood . This feels like he still here doing what we all love . Nothing last forever all i hope that he is racing Colin Mcrae in paradise and im glad the he inspired me to cars and i had a chance to see this audi in person #kb43ver
Супер
Ken is the definition of boys don't grow up, we just get bigger toys.   Legends never die.
❤
thank you ken and the guys at hoonigan for creating gymkhana, ken's legacy will live on forever and he will never be forgotten ❤
Fuck electric cars and fuck however comments back on this .
grazie ken. 😥
What a guy.  We miss you Ken.  Always will.  Rip in peace
wow so cool
R.I.P. Legend forever be missed.
Such a legend we all miss you ken. RIP Kenny from the block.
Ken Block; The Man Who Got Me Addicted to Rally, Drifting, Gymkhana, and Speed. I will miss you Ken, you were my idol
Thank you Ken.
Man that ending really made me tear up, well done from the Hoonigan and Ken, RIP king. 🤍
R.I.P Legend
Great driving as always, very impressive. Not quite as satisfying without the screaming gasoline burning engine noise, though.
Wonder if Lisa block will continue this gymkhana
#KB43er
RIP legend
life feels incomplete without you. KB43er.
Those onions better be goin into some Pico bro....seriously killer
En memoria de ken block hermanos! muy bien JUCA fuiste uno de los pocos que puedo estar con unos de los grandes! Que emocion perroo!
Been waiting for this one even before that tragic day, rest in peace KB43. Can’t believe this is the last one we’ll watch with Ken 😢
❤😢😭😭🇧🇷
Another one out of the park Scotto! Absolutely devastating to think its over, but over the moon we all got one more.
#kb43ver
Amazing. Thank you, Ken.
❤
The first and last time finally Ken send it real hard and able to trust Audi to improve the car better which suits him (and please bear with those damages 😬). Also, I do realize that this upgraded version has a paddle shifter 🤯. RIP Ken Block, will be missed in automotive world
Hell yeah
this is absolutely incredible to see! Fantastic footage!
We miss you #KentBlock
RIP to the legend. He will be missed. But EV’s are dumb
Legends Never Die.   We miss you ken 💔
An epic legend gone too soon. The good this man put into the world can rarely be matched. KB43ver!!!
RIP to the best to ever do it! You'll be missed Ken. I remember watching the first one so long ago and thinking how cool it would be to do that myself. Thanks for the memories!
The end credits was a beautiful tribute
Can't wait to NEVER see this car in any kind of production form.
Cold Chills when the music hits and credits roll... :( #KB43ver
It’s unfortunate that his last Gymkhana had to be electric. It’s just not the same. Electrikhana One only having 8.9m views and other Gymkhana videos averaging 60m-70m views tells the story.   Regardless, RIP to the legend who inspired generations of carcaine addicts.
What a treat it is to see this! 😀 I didn't know this existed or was coming, so it's quite a nice surprise.
RIP Ken you will be missed the best driver ever. God bless you and your family
rip
Who?
Thank u Ken, for inspiring many people with your style n energy. We miss u Ken❤️
We will never forget what you and your team did for the car/racing community. Your Hooning and craziness is a big inspiration to a lot of people. Keep hooning wherever you might be. #forever43
Terrible day for rain.
#juca 😁😁
KB43VER
V8 engin sounds good... Electric sound🤔Noooo!!
I swear to god, it has been so fast. Rest in pierce Ken.
That credit scene sends goosebumps down my body, still a little bit unreal that this would be the final one. #KB43VER
Ken Block you will be a legend to everyone forever! Thank you Hoonigan for giving us this . Rest In Hoonigan Heaven Ken
one more time , one last ride ,, forever hooning in the star, HHIC R.I.P KEN
RIP
I'm so glad that ken block got to film one last video, brings tears to my eyes
Watched every single one multiple times! Forever a legend!
One last ride. Thank you Ken! Absolute legend, who is sorely missed in the motorsport world. Your legacy lives on with your family and all the motorsport fans around the world. Thank you KB.
Damn not even ken could make an EV cool
KB43VER
Watched this with a tear in each eye .. one of sadness and one of happiness ..  still the best .. KB43ver
I miss ken...
The legend will never die, 43 forever.
Never be replace 43
Dang, still can't believe he's gone. What an epic dude.
Ken block the legend…
I truly had trouble clicking on this video. Nobody has inspired me as much as ken block did. I pray for his family and this traumatic experience. And best wishes for Lisa block, and carrying on her fathers legacy!
You know what I like about electrics? They always go WEEEEEEEE like they are having a blast =P
What a great way to end the gymkhana series awesome to see what ken could do whenever a new one we’re to of come out #kb43ver
Thanks to everyone who put this out. Ken brought my passion back for Autosport and automotive in general.
i just bought ght yesterday a pair of DC shoes...star wars edition
Alright. Now Lia's turn to take the reigns. Travis can help her alot
🥱
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a Legend!
R.I.P to the goat 🫡
KB43ver
Great work guys. The torque in that electric thing makes for some mind blowing defying of physics as we knew it. Do miss the sound of that V8 in the Hoonicorn though!  Great clips at the end to remind us of all the work you’ve done over the years to inspire us car obsessives; the world over 👊 Ken will always be missed. Looking forward to the day Lia takes the wheel on a gymkhana 😎
#KB43er
RIP Ken...shoutout to his family!
Excellent Job team! I cant even begin to imagine the logistics challenge of the airport shots, to capture the terminals when devoid of people! the tribute in the credits was excellent as well. Thank you all for the tireless effort to bring us these 8 minutes of entertainment. KB will forever live on in our hearts. I am sorry for all of your loss, Ken meant a lot to people who have never even met him, I can only imagine the pain one must feel to those close to him.
RIP Ken 🫡

#KB43VER ❤
There's a stupid thing I do.  I rarely watch the last few episodes of my favorite show, if I don't watch it the show never ends. I don't want to watch this, I don't want to admit that Ken is gone, and I don't want this to be the last one.....
Oh man, heart skipped just seeing the upload. Rest in Peace to a King. Such a humble human.  Hes greatly missed by myself and many more around the globe. KB43VER
This just solidified why he's the king at what he does, Ken Block will forever be a legend 🙏🏽🔥
The myth, the legend, the God of 4 wheels!   Cheers Kenny from the block.
Obrigado por tudo Ken Block!!! Lendas nunca morrem!!! #KB43VER
Ken Block , you LEGEND !
Sad to say my good friend that introduced me to ken block and hoonigan also passed away this year 😢 just 2weeks before his birthday. RIP RICKY RICARDO  RIP BEN BLOCK. NEVER WILL FORGET EITHER ONE 🖤🖤
Watching this just feels like he never left us. RIP.
#KB43VER
I'm not crying...YOU'RE crying!
Thank you four making this more then a video I can feel the labor of love you guys put into this
had to get my wife to come with me and help me tru this... Ken is my greatest idol, legends never die #kb43er
Anyone else just staring at their screen when it ended..? That tribute to the previous Gymkhana's got to me
Dear Kenneth We miss you !
We miss you Mr. Block.
Legend ❤
One of the greatest to do it, and the sole reason I have a love for rally and Rallycross. KB43ver
Amazing job everyone!!! So sick!! I miss you Ken!! Forever the greatest!!!
Had to watch it twice as the first time something got in my eyes that made it difficult to watch it 100%. Amazing video and I wish your family all the best!
Didn’t know this was dropping today but damn am I glad it did. #KB43ver
<3#KB43VER<3 thanks for everything brother
❤ love you Ken
why so many 'gears' on this 1000hp electric drivetrain?
WOW! THIS!, THIS WAS AMAZING! After  seeing the little stories on the Facebook page with the little behind the scenes about adapting and figuring out how to work the car especially for this specific Gymkhana really makes sense now! BUT needless to say this was absolutely amazing! Honestly held back tears till the end and totally broke down! Knowing this is the last Gymkhana but maybe not the last “NEW” video with Ken Block is truly saddening!   Ken Block it was an honour to of been able to experience the pure thrill and excitement to watch your videos over the years I was 10 years old when your first Gymkhana video was released and ALTHOUGH I was also watching ALL your Rally videos it was always something I looked forward too!   So thank you Ken for at least 15 years of excitement!   Because of you I’ve always wanted to get into Rally and slowly over the course of the next few years I myself will hopefully be part of CRC and ARC! I’ll continue to attend local events and volunteer and hopefully soon drive in an event!   My BIGGEST wish was to meet you one day! BUT there will always be a piece of you with your family and HOONIGAN so now I’m making it in my best interest to meet all you guys and personally go to the Hoonigan shop!   R.I.P. HHIC Ken Block You’ll forever be missed but will ALWAYS be an INSPIRATION! #KB43VER! #Hoonigan #43i #KenBlock @TheHoonigans
Slidin and gliden in heaven
He did one of those lazy 180 with a car
That part where he closed his eyes, preparing himself for possibly running into the curb and flipping off the road? That sits with me.  "If you're not scared, you're not going fast enough"  he wasn't superman. He wasn't batman. He wasn't anything. He was just like any one of us. Just a man who did his best. A great man. One I will never forget. Rest in tyre shreds you fucking legend
I am crying after watching car videos now. I really need to get my shit together.
That montage at the end for the credits 😢😢 RIP Ken.
I can't stop crying after watching this ❤ i can speak for everyone we miss you Ken can't wait to see lia pick thinks up where you left off #KB43ver
What a send-off. Kudos to the Hoonigan team for making sure all of Ken's legacy is on display. What a man.
That was another extremly well made and even better driven Video and I wish I could enjoy more of these in the future. Now I'll rewatch all of the old gymkhanas like I did when Ken died and enjoy his driving once more. RIP Ken Block
❤
今でも信じられない… 何かの間違いでもいいからまたジムカーナをするKenを見たい…😢
Those 360 no scopes on the roundabout😍
WHAT THE F*CK IS THE KILOMETER !!! Ken Block was THE legend of motorsport we can not forget this men, Rest In Peace ❤
Thank you Ken.  Thank you Hoonigan (The guys Hoonigan, not the conglomerate Hoonigan).  Y’all are one of my very few enjoyments I have left after so much has been taken from me (neurological disorder). Since 2011… sh_t, before that, I have lived vicariously through y’all.  No exaggeration, y’all saved my life a couple times of the years. Thank you for everything @thehoonigan and @kenblock 💜
#143KB I hope we can have a Dolby THX Everything version of this ❤
in evry shot that i see his face he is so chilled like a fking dad
There have been many legendary drivers but no one changed racing the way Ken did, cars use to be serious tools not to be played with…until Ken started playing
Ive never seen Ken scared in a car before , so that is some machine right there. RIP old hero !
Thanks to the whole Hoonigan crew for taking motorsport by the scruff of it's neck shakin the shit outta it and putting forth a yet again banga of a video Scotto's & Ken's envisioning was just mad love the imperfections in it to makes it more real for us to wrap our minds around thanks for the most awesome memories #43KB LEGEND
#KB43er!
A legend gone to soon. But you left a legacy behind and I believe you're smiling from above to see your friends and family living by your lifestyle❤
Ken etched his mark in us all and history itself , the man beat life and sadly left us all , while still enjoying the things he loved. Champions are 43ver!!!
I miss him like I knew him.  Thank you for this
#KB43VER ❤✌️
We will always remember him with these spectacular skids, jumps, passing through unexpected places, etc. Only Ken Block could do these maneuvers, I hope that in the future, Lia Block He is encouraged to do his own Gymkhana, as a great tribute to her father 😢. Thanks for everything Ken, we will always remember you 🚗💨⚡🔌💪🏼🇺🇲🥺.  #KB43VER.
One last ride 🫶🏻 you defined my childhood Ken. That‘s it, the last video i was waiting for, time to unfollow Hoonigan! You‘d be mad if you saw what Hoonigan became, using a Ken Block lookalike from Wish to promote your gear lol. F ‘em. KB43VER!
RIP ken block will miss you and everyone else you have changed so many lives and your affect on the car world as help so much. Thank you ken
my favourite electric car right here^
He is a legend who will live in our hearts forever. Made me love cars
Thanks for the memories Ken.
It gives me goosebumps whenn i see this .⚓️⚓️

Ken Block started my intertesting for cars, motorsport and drift, he did a lot for me, legend. Thanks for all, hoonigan. #KB43ver
Just thank you, that's all I have to say is thank you. KB43VER

electric car is a shixxxxx
RIP Ken. You’re the only celebrity death I’ve ever cried over. We’ll miss you, man.
4:18 we have all made that same face when getting a bit close 😅.
Yo at start I was thinking I’m not a fan of electric cars, but then realised it’s not the car that’s important it’s the driver doing cool stuff with it, by the end I’m feeling pretty sad we won’t see him doing this again ❤😢😢
Thank you for all the thrills over the last 15 years Ken! You have helped inspire multiple generations of car lovers! Brian/Ron & crew massive thanks too, for your creative vision for all these films! #KB43ver #DontSlowDown #LegendsNeverDie
Ken Block, we really amazed by your driftinga around the world, even the legendary Hoonicorn, all over the world will remember your name Ken Block! Drift Legend Never Dies #KB43er ❤
Tamiya need to make the hoonitron! Watching this car reminds me so much of playing with rc cars as a  kid. RIP Ken
We all miss you KB43VER rest in peace Ken block
That ending hit me hard 😢 RIP Ken
Imagine all the tires he burnt through since going to the big track in the sky! RIP Ken Block.
He left us too soon😢
extremly emotional material, thanks guys for the last one. he was amazing.
That shot in the bug makes the Audi look like the most menacing car in existence. GG KB43VER
KB43VER
Why does it still hurt so much? I miss you Ken.
Its to early for my eyes to be leaking water guys. You know allergies and stuff.... God Speed Ken.
I'd say that's better than the first Electrikhana too, more carnage, love it
Miss you ken, you were a gem in this world
RIP to a Legend
The best part about this video is that for the last ten minutes or so of my life, Ken was still with us. Thank you for that.
The man who could do anything in a car will be missed ❤✌️🔥🔥
What a fricken legend. The best to ever do it.
Rip
There will never be another Ken Block
That montage 😢
I'm thankful that I was able to watch him on his journey and had the excitement of learning about stuff I thought I'd never like, I aim to build my truck like his one day,  he was and still is an inspiration to millions. thank you Ken Block, Thank you Hoonagan, you guys brought joy to millions and made waves, I hope he's enjoying drifting those golden brick roads. 🕊️ Rest in peace, you absolute legend. 🕊️
I didnt want it to enf KB43ver
Imagine how much cooler this would have been if this thing had an i5.
KB43VER 🖤 💚
#KB43VER Thanks for all the fantastic cars, moments, places, drifts, events, stunts, gymkhanas, electrikhanas you've done. You always gonna have special place in our hearts. I loved rallying because of you.  You were the best ambassador the sport has ever had. Thanks again for everything you and HOONIGAN team has done.
GOD BLESS KEN BLOCK.

Forever and Always HHIC   Rest In Peace #43
In memorable moments. You'll be missed greatly. Race in Peace
Watching this has brought a tear to my eye #kb43ver
So many times when a camera kicks to Ken, he's grinning from ear to ear. It is very sad we lost him. I have been in a low place and latched on to binge watching Top Gear, Grand Tour, and everything Clarkson, Hammond and May. Which really helps. But when I see Hammond teaching his daughter to drive rally. I cry and miss KB and want the same for his daughters.  I have watched KB for years! He has helped me through some hard times by just being him and doing his thing. Thank you, KB and family!  ~One Love~ KB43ver
:46 😢 his laugh.. kb43vr 😭
He was such an incredible driver. You will be missed legend 😢 ❤ #KB4LIFE
Thank you Ken for all the epic action you gave us. Hero of my lifetime who will never be forgotten. RIP bro. 👊🏻

One more playground for one last time... thanks for everything Ken. Thanks hoonigan for posting this. it isnt easy to watch but I will enjoy like i did with the others. KB43 Forever
Miss him ❤
I know there have been many amazing hoonigan productions, but I will never forget the excitement I had when i saw the 1st gymkhana video. It was so pure and just exhibition of what car could do in the right hands. After following Ken all these years i can say i will never forget the 1st one, and i will continue to watch and support hoonigan and hope to see more on his family's racing careers.
The ending really got me 😢
Beautiful and heartbreaking.  Thank you.
One of tha goats truly amazing seeing him shred mexico one last time ✝️🦖💯🅿️

The tire slayer legend Mr Ken Block. We all miss you 🔥🔥🔥🔥💨💨💨🛞🛞🛞🛞

Awesome! I have questions... a couple, how the fuck did you close down an airport? Did anything break on the hoonitron? (also, love the historical footage. You guys were babies!)
That's an awesome video, but it felt weird to watch. Knowing this is the last one is very sad.
Rip ken block 😢

I didn't expect this so soon! I wasn't ready for this! I got still pain in my hearth and I'm not mentaly ok since his death. I had multiple times depresion. And together with the final show of my favourite band (KISS) last weekend this is the worst year in my life.
SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!!! Ken Block will be an inspiration for the future car enthusiasts and bring countless number of people to love vehicles. He will continue to  be missed
Long life 43

What a save 🤯🤯🤯🇲🇽 4:14
Huge thanks to Scotto and the crew. KB43 will continue to live on through your work, and we all owe you for that. 👏
Ohhhhhhh!  Now I get all the parts breaking.  Audi wanted this car destroyed, and Ken and team said, "At least let US destroy it!  Should have lead with that IMHO https://youtu.be/U4FAqwkn-pc?t=382
👌👌👌
I think if someone asked to do those stunts in a US airport, they’d just get laughed at. Great video Hoonigan! RIP Ken 😞
tanks Ken
Definitely something amazing, sad we won’t be able to see this happen again. Rip Mr block
What an awesome final video also reminiscing of all the years of hooning, shredding, fun. Rest In Peace Ken, you meant a lot to us all, and thanks to hoonigan for putting this one together, all of you got me into cars ❤

So bittersweet watching this, got really sad watching the credits #kb43ver
This is AMAZING and fitting - The camera work... I mean everything, is stunning in this vid. Ken Block was a truly amazing human being and I hope his daughter continues to tear it up in his place.
Ken Block 43ver 🏁❤
Thank you for the memories! KB43VER
KB43 ❤
I kind of didn't want to watch this, because then it would be all over.  What a great video, way to pay homage to the great one.  I'm not crying, you're crying. KB43
I was watching the gymkhana files on prime video last night and here we are!
Rest in Speed, mr. Block🌹
🕊️
Been waiting for this ever since the teaser. What a bloke an amazing dad and tutor so glad he got to build the Audi with his daughter such a loss to the motorsport community.
Thank you for the memories Ken!! #KB43vr
Ken did not die. Cause he lives in our memories.
KB43VER.
He was not as focused as we know him. the man seems differnt.   maby😕
The end credits broke me
Ken will forever be a massive inspiration and light of joy in the automotive world to me and so many others. Legends never die. #KB43er ❤
I wonder how many fully charges this represents.  We miss you Ken, but rest assured Lia is gonna carry on your legacy, and I think you know that!
Thank You Ken Block ❤ #KB43VER
Long live #KB43EVER❤
Hopefully Lia can continue the legacy
R.I.P. Ken, we will never forget what you did for everyone.
This video is going to absolutely blow up. Rest easy Ken
And this my far the sloppiest gymkhana video he’s made
This nigga truly lived without fear 💔
Got to say for this being hoonigan and Ken block and the fact that this is the final video like this we’re ever gonna see from Ken. I among many others wish hoonigan would of made a better final product… clearly most of hoonigan was Ken block. Shit just ain’t the same with out HHIC… poor execution hoonigan
In tears watching it😢
Thank you guys for this, so cool to see this legend one more time.
I wish they could preserve all the tire marks as a permanent memorial
Ken Block legend
The Legend 🕊 Thanks for everything Ken Block ! 🙏🏼

LLKB The Legend🕊️🫡🔥

4:20 the way ken looked in the rearview closing his eyes hoping he doesn't mess up and hit something; yet still manage to make reverse entries a work of art. Big up from Jamaica and thanks to all you hoonigans; especially you Ken; for making me the car nerd I am today. #KB43VER

RIP the legendary Ken block, an absolute icon in the motorsport world and inspired so many people like myself to push to the limits, rest easy big man #KB43 💚
Ken Block is the Eviel Knievel and Dale Earnhardt of Gen Y and Z.
He will forever remain a legend for the aumomotive world
R.I.P doesn’t hit like the hoonicorn though
My ultimate idol of speed and crazy. Love you ken. Fly high and hoon in paradise
I love that you guys kept it real, and showed all of the imperfections. Still insane driving.  The 540 on the freeway to go back the other way was insane
Rest in peace we all loved you man!
Is almost like nothing happened, Like he still around doing what he loves❤️ RIP KEN 💪🏼💪🏼🏎️💨
Seeing this knowing he’s gone just broke me more, been watching block since a little kid and to watch this when he gone just don’t hit the same anymore
RIP   KEN BLOCK...............we will never ever forguet this ICON.        REST IN PEACE MAN.
The legacy of Ken has never died! He'll always be in any racing fan's heart❤  Also, Mexico... Does that hint for the Hoonitron to come to Forza Horizon 5????
RIP Mozart of skidding, we will never forget you
This is really hard to watch 😢 Rip 🙏
RIP KB43!! Your Superior driving prowess will live on 4EVR!!!
Kens just casually dropping the gnarliest driving video from the afterlife. This is one hell of a way to say goodbye. KB43VER
We will never forget you Ken. Thank you.
I starting to cry
That car must secretly be a honey badger, it freaking takes what it wants!
The legacy of Ken Block will live on, regardless of if the cars are gas or electric.  Keep driving sideways and smiling, hoonigans!
Wow. Special car. Miss Block great Talent.  He was just a Icon, a proundness to USA best drivers from around the World.
RIP Ken Block, thank you for getting me back into motorsports!! There'll never be another quite like you!
