IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE BACK! ⚡
GOOOOOOOOOO NYCK AND VANDOORNE🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 WINS THAT❤❤❤❤
this is my first run in with formula E, can someone explain how attack mode works?
I like formula e
Anyone noticed vandoorne finished the race on 0.0% energy?
If David Croft become Formula E Comentator He will say "It's lights out and away we go in Diriyah"
4:08 4:29 O CARRO DA FRENTE, POR TER OBEDECIDO A HORA, O TEMPO & MOMENTO CERTO. POR TER FREADO, & FEITO DRIFT, CURVA DO JEITO CERTO, & DA MANEIRA CORRETA,  NÃO FOI ULTRAPASSADO PELO CARRO DE TRÁS, RARÍSSIMO DE ACONTECER! PARA POUQUÍSSIMOS!

ISN'T that so SWEET, GROWN MEN DRIVING AROUND the TRACK IN ELECTRIC APPLIANCES ! SO THRILLING
formule E sucks so hard
These cars look SO futuristic
Can't wait night race in Jakarta 🏎️🏎️🏎️
Liveries are beautiful this year.  Nice to see color from more than just Tacheetah
F1 fan here , I rly can’t stand the sound of FE but I can’t deny the fact that we see better racing in formula e
Amazing racing. Love the cars colors schemes
Formula E is like watching fireworks without the sounds.
I just.. can't. I hope normal F1 never goes away. I tried, I really really tried to like Formula E but it just isn't as good. Drivers are dirty af and the sound is just annoying. They're slower and the strategy seems to be who can be the dirtiest without breaking the car. It's just bad.
Even the highlights are boring in Formula E...
In formula e: merc 1and 2 In f1: merc 5 and 10
Someone can tell me about the track with arrows in the floor, what happend with that,  i like  f zero  jajaja
here for antonio
Now this is podracing
Cute little radio-controlled cars.
there are african 4 yo boys and girls who are hustleing all day to mine cobalt until they die and then there are people watching formula e.
Mercedes being Mercedes
These looks like GT7 in real life ... dang...
Msntaps
When will the full races be on, it's all behind blokades.
It’s kinda cool but nothing like the roar and smell of a combustion engine.
Im a F1 fan and I think you know what driver I'm rooting for       Its Giovinazzi!
🏁🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️💚🖤balafan formula 2022gouu

Pascal Wehrlein had the most Overtakes absolutely stunning
Giovinazzi sempre tra gli ultimi !!!!!
Looks like giovinazzi sucks here too lol
Que cagada hiciste estofel!!!!!, la victoria era tuya!!!!. Saludos Desde Panamá.
That's some close racing right there. This is gonna be one hell of a season.
What the hell happened to Lotterer?
Nissn or Mahindra, please change something about your livery, they look almost the same on TV derp
Broadcasting fiasco this season. Just lost a new fan.
Sans son de moteur c'est aussi excitant qu'une course de planche à repasser. Ajouttez du SON! Sans son vous perdez 90% de  l'intérêt!
F1 Fan thats looking to support Formula E this season aswell for the sake of more racing. Question, are the races always so dirty in Formula E? Seems like theres alot of contact and crashing into eachother.
Apa kabar formula e jkt?
I can't get excited by this racing. I hate the sound it's like a hoover. This going green rubbish has made the world a pile of poo ...
First time watcher but who in the hell had the idea of showing the teams full name by the side you'd need a jumbotron to read those
That was a good race to open the season. Not a fan of night racing but a good show for sure.
Lots of Dirty driving.
Looks like verstappen would fit in well!
With Qualifying finally not being a lottery, I actually really love FE now. Might still not like FanBoost, but with drivers being in their rightful positions, I can almost completely overlook that. Might actually get entertained until the end of this season!
Mannaia Forza Giovinazzi! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBJuuCvFLBc
Thank you! These highlight videos are amazing! Just going to watch these from now on instead of the live events. CBS Sports has totally ruined the broadcast by playing commercials mid-race with no regard for whether it is a good time or not. Their announcers are also horribly boring with no excitement in the commentary. It is an absolute crime to not give us the Jack Nicholls audio feed. Thankful to have it here in these videos!
Fe has more contact than f1 2020 Open lobbys
WHAT A RACE, BATTLES
It looks like RC racing while cars are bumping into each other.
🔥🔥🔥
Good luck every driver in 2022!
Attack mode shouldn’t exist
This is certainly going to keep me entertained until F1 is back 🤩
You wanna show the results table for more than 1 second? YouTube is free you know...not like you're paying for the time. 🙄
Do they have to call it attack mode? :/
Will the full races be available to watch this season too?
Mercedes 1-2
Such an underrated sport
Seriously, putting the whole 1st race on YT and then just taking it off like that... man... I taught this year we finally can enjoy the full races, but it seem it was all a click bait again :S If I have to wait months to see the whole Formula E season AFTER the final, I really considering NOT giving a *** anymore. This whole thing felt just like a slap in the face. Shame.
Would be nice if I ever actually get to watch this live in Canada…
Excuse me but the entire race disappeared from the channel
Are you going to post the full race?
Minus the two Mercs driving off into the distance, the battle for 3rd, 4th onwards was so exciting, so nail bitingly close! Love it. I hope F1 is this close this year.
Mercedes 1-2 _love to see it_
Im new to FE so I might be completely wrong here, but is the track narrower than an F1 track? It feels like they have 0 room
Attack Mode is awesome Feature
Scalextric
Scalectrix
New season starts with an Mercedes first 1-2 since Berlin S6, epic battle for podium Lotterer vs all Digra first race for Venturi end with top 5 finish Dennis old team new sponsor first podium of the season, Unlucky da Costa, olli vs Frijns first crash of the season, Giovinazzi close to be the first unlap car of the season very unlucky debut race, guenther for nissan in top 10, both Venturi with an great points pocket, Cassidy with p6 an great start into the season 🤩🤩🤩👍👍👌  Race 2 maybe Nyck back to back win? Venturi Podium? Bird win? 👍👍👍🤩
😪
Formula E is basically a online F1 lobby everybody smashes into each other and 9/10 drivers go wide into corners
Oliver Rowland at 29 learns that actions have consequences.  Beautiful driving by Frijns getting the dirty driver out of the race!
Nooooo Vandoorne noo, that should have been P1 c'mon
Is there going to be some way to watch replays or are they all going up at the end of the season again
The thing that stops me from taking this category seriously is all the gimmicky extras: attack mode and fan boost. Makes it seem more like an arcade racing game than a legit championship.
The car's sound is horrible🤮
The full live race is on the Channel 4 Sport Youtube channel guys.
where can i watch the whole race?
I think they forgot to put sound from track to the video
What was Giovinazzi doing in formula 1 for 3 years ? Blocking seats
if you do some action here in F1.... there wil be raining Penalty's  :) if MAx and Lewisa do sort of things media is kinda blow up :)
never knew FE would be this exciting,.. you have a new fan...
Congrats Nyck 😍😍
1:56 Good o'l Dump and run
Why do many FE drivers drive like amateurs lmao
Poor Lotterer
italian jesus cmonnnnn
Great season opener. Very sensible drive from Askew, destined for great things in FE I'd say
Fantastic race . Keep up the good work.
where is GIovenattzi ?
Formula E needs to step up their game because this is very boring
We need a Red Bull team in formula e...and Michael Masi ;-)
Im hooked. I just became a fan.
Amazing performance by Lucas once again. Unfortunately, Venturi chose to take the 2nd attack mode too late versus Bird, so in the end he managed to stay in front of the Brazilian
FULL RACES PLEASE!
It is so unfair that NDV doesn’t have F1 seat and this is the last year to join FE for Benz EQ
Giovinazzi: I am all the FanBoost
Controversial opinion I like attack mode it’s like a joker lap + drs
Watching FE for the first time and it's really exciting. 🤩
Where did the full race disappear?
It's like silent disco lol
There was some issue with the live feed for the race ☹️ FYI
Yo, Forumla E is impossible to watch in Aus...
I hope the italian jesus can win or at least get a podium. Forza gioooo
Askew tho, from P17 to P9 on his first ever FE race
The US commentators were so bad that I started commenting instead. Watch party said I did a better job.
Oh so laney aka the eyes forward Sam bird race engineer has now become stoffel vandoornes engineer
Hope Formula E is getting better and better in future
I was thinking of following Formula E but the presentation of it is really poor. I can't see how many laps are there. I can't hear any radios. I can't see the timings of the race in it's application. I should Appreciate  Formula 1 in terms of race presentation and Formula E should learn from them.
The race was decided because the lead driver didn’t correctly go off line to activate “attack mode”. What an awful excuse for motorsport this is.
Maaaan Andre Lotterer fell from 3rd to 13th 😭
Well I see the Mercedes guys are making their intentions clear.
Here just to get warmed up for f1 😍
What happened to the quali stream yesterday? It just stopped 20 mins in?
I'm so proud with de vries, he is getting growing better 😃😃
why did you private the full race?
Shame that Vandoorne let the win slip
Get in there, Nick.
Let's go giovinazzi ✊☺, "você ainda vai ganhar uma corrida , eu acredito" ☺👍
Oh noo😪the sound of them🤣
Askew did a Sato (during his F1 days)... Outta nowhere, went through the field like a Kamekaze 😆
I'm an F1, NASCAR Indycar fan, but became an FE fan recently. It's good to have something plesurable to watch during the Winter Break. Loving it ❤
Mercedes pls lose
what happened to CBS commentary, it was like watching golf
God I hate these cars
Love it! Feels good to have Formula E back!
Wow.Just WOW. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE CAR RATHER THEN " MERCS"  AT THR FRONT,NOT EVEN FIGHTING AT ALL. Another championship served on platter to the Merc.☹️ FE has its identity of Unpredictable field during quali,and yielding Better Race overall. But this new Quali format eliminated all of that.Just Great. Instead of this,FE must taken the Season 1& 2 qualifying lottery system,it should be much more Awesome thing to watch in quali and for setting up nicely for Race.
I hope Mercedes change their decision of quitting formula E.
The Merc teams are 1-2 in the standings 🥴
I'm so glad with the partnership with Tv Cultura. Can't wait for tomorrow's race. Go Di Grassi !
I’m just here for the second coming of Jesus! Let’s go gio!
Watching R1 and recognizing all the names mentioned during last year's Berlin start incident 😆
Sensation
The Formula E has same with Formula One. I love it!
Gio really brought his F1 skill, a solid P20 just like he always did in F1  GO ZHOU

Rowland gets Karma for dangerous driving is something of a satisfying scene
Really hope Vandoorne can clinch the title this year
What happened to Audi abt ?
Still struggling to watch the full race but these recaps are fire.
Always happy to share!
Come on GIO
@ABB Formula E, upload the full qualifying and race videos
Unexpected askew did get points 👏👏
unsubscribe since you took the full race offline
Just realized, this is essentially an endurance race.
I'm an f1 fan and am here tbh for giovinazzi
THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL SPORT. HOW IS EVERYONE GLOBALLY SUPPOSED TO WATCH EACH RACE LIVE!? I'M IN THE PACIFIC TIME ZONE!   How does FE expect to hold fans if they have no subscription service like the F1 app and not a single service offering full race replays.  Myself and 5 of my friends wanted to support this new exciting race series and we jumped on board to volunteer for the city-assisted service for the Vancouver race weekend.   You just lost 6 supports and volunteers.  Super dissaponted.  We all know you need to sell the screening rights to make any money in the sport nowadays, but accessibility to your fans should ALWAYS come first.
Fucking boring, commentator can't even be arsed its that boring
I'm a F1 fan and its my first time to watch Formula E. So, I will try my very best to adjust myself in knowing the drivers (asides Da Costa, De Vries, Vandoorne, Vergne, Giovinazzi, Wehrlein), teams and most especially the formats of FP, Qualifying and races... I hope to balance about this with F1. 😊😁
Di Grassi 😏
Race highlights
Diriyah E-Prix
Fucking boring 🤦🏾‍♂️
Vandoorn... that was a rookie mistake right there...
You don't even keep the practice sessions up when the race has started? RIDICULOUS. I re-subscribed to this channel for the start of the season but apparently that was a waste of time. Make your YT channel worthwhile instead of spamming it with dumb little "preview bits" and hiding all the action from fans. Unsubscribed.
WHERE DO I WATCH THESE RACES WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS
🏎🏎🏎
Why would you stream it but not save it? :( Missed the race.
Amazing overtake
Excellent result for Oliver Askew on his debut race!
best First  FORMULE E Race 2022 Good job vandoorne & de vries we go to Race 2
Way to show askew having an incredible drive
I'm an F1 fan and this is the first FE season I'm gonna follow and at least some things are familiar. Mercedes 1,2. FML
I want to be deaf
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This is certainly going to keep me entertained until F1 is back 🤩
Private Video WTF
Please stream the races on YouTube as I really wanted to watch but was unable to
I like the New formula e graphics
I'm here for my man Giovinazzi, come on Antonio, we support you 👊
Really hate the Mercedes domination!!! 😡😡
Who cares about those vacuum cleaners? Who cares who will win and lost there? What is the point in winning of this ridiculous chpionship? Honestly?
this is a joke. first teasing a full race and then stop streaming..
If vettel was in formule e he would have unlimeted fanboost and win every race
Anyone know how I can watch this mediocre series? Maybe if I got to actually watch and enjoy a race I’d get into it more
Let's go De Vries! Back to back titles maybe?
not me trying to watch my first formula e race in peace after work, only to be cut off 25 mins before the end by the video becoming private...
The tracks they race in makes me sick 🤧🤒
Four teams got both cars into the points
Kinda glad Mercedes is going at the end of the season... They ruin every sport they compete in
Lol... I finished watching the full race and it went private. xD
Why was the stream stopped
Suggestion for the highlights, make them not so fast at the end so we can actually read the results, instead of just a flash of some numbers.
I wish FE drop street tracks. It make tha cars look slow and make every overtake something clumsy. If they want to keep those track they show make the cars smaller (both lenght/width)
I appreciate these highlights, but was appreciating the full stream even more an hour ago until you made it a private video two-thirds of the way through me watching  🙃
Why is the livestream not there. I see him. And then the video is privat :(
I thought the race was tomorrow... I really wanted to watch it. I HATE TIME ZONES!!!!!
I was watching the race replay since I couldn't watch it live... And in the middle it stopped and said the video was private...
Dear Formula E, Please give Codemasters the licensing so they can make a game for us. I want to be able to drive these things in their own game. Thanks.
Stoffel is so unlucky my god!
why do u private ur vids
Drivers miss the Attack Mode lines all the time but get the boost, but when Stoffel "Unlucky" Vandoorne does it, he loses the victory😩
hopefully gio steps up next race
Mercedes domination….. where have we heard that one before?
Pretty meh race but I think that comes down to the track itself.
my heart hurt when Lotterer dropped from 3 to 13
Merc domination just changed series-
Super boring race, and also mega disappointed with Stoffel’s mistake…1/5 ⭐️ for me
1 wyścig
IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE BACK! ⚡
