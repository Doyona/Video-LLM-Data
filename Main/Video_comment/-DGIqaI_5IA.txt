The plane crashes questions are top tier
4:50 wtf?? it's Blinding lights by the weeknd
4:50 wtf?? it's Blinding lights by the weeknd
32:30
It's funny because the two that won JJ and Ethan most people would say the pair was the least intelligent. But Harry also said Josh and Vik were thought of to be the most intelligent and they won nothing so 🤷
My recommended is finally doing something right.
I was screaming Tenerife at my phone because i also love air crash investigation. Must be an autistic thing as I’m also autistic😭😂
32:21 LGBTQ Icon Ethan 43:58 Ancient History Josh
They spelt kangaroo wrong 💀💀💀 1:00:41
But Harry, how foggy was it ? 12:58 😂😂😂
Classic Sidemen!
Poor vik.. josh really did hold him back here
Why's vik looking extra yellow
I think josh couldn’t answer because he did not understand. Otherwise he is goated in geography.
W jj and zerka
omg endling was so funny hahahahhahahahhaahahhahahahahahah
20:51 Harry's reaction 🤣🤣🤣🤣
41:55 that devious smile from Harry. He knew he confused them.
Who’s here after Nick avocado transformation 😂
32:20 😭😭😭
31:20 The way Harry says both of these categories is just comedy gold honestly
😂😂😂 can we have another like this
🤣🤣🤣JJ and Ethan might be an elite team They just won an abandoned video (2025)😅and look at them in this video
French Guiana love, French Guinea is in W-Africa and isn't called this since decades. <3
WE NEED A NUMBER 2 😊😊
32:55 absolute cinematic violation
Violation!😂😂
20
Im Australian. Them not knowing what a wombat is annoys me. Im offended. Good video tho chaps.
43:34 this aged well 😂
K stands for knowledge
Anyone in 2025
Vik: why didn’t we get ancient history?!? Also Vik: *gets super easy geography question wrong even after he hedged his bets*
Josh discussing with the audience while Vik dumps everything on “havanese” and Josh not even knowing was hilarious.
32:49
21:45 A wombat are animals which are always "so happy" as they "dance to joy division and celebrate the irony". Ive also recently heard that they are "moving to new york" but if you ask me I think, although they love america, america hates them, but if they really wanna go then cant really say no.
I wanted lgbtq icons 😢
Tenerfie, i seen it i love air crash
32:20
This one’s better than the second one
French Guyana is next to Brazil

Harry's hosting>>>>
11:09
Ethan running like Stormzy is like lee Evans running on stage
Harry is always the judge in these type videos and I love it
21:40 Simon: what is a wombat  Australian's: 👁👄👁

Harry: "Shape of You" The screen behind him: "Shape of Me" 😭😭😭
Who’s here after the new sidemen video
Btw guinea isn’t french they been done dirty there
How are they so dumb?
Maybe it is time the Canadian government looks into being a republic and leaving the commonwealth.
the longest french border question was so painful to watch
this is weird how its on my youtube page and they literally filmed a part 2 of this a few days ago😂
Well the end was weird.
5:53 bro put on rockstar😂😂😂 it aint even post malones top 1😂😂😂😂
2024?
20:40
Vikk and Josh get way too much credit for geography knowledge if they think France owns a part of Canada
They’ve gotta do this again
French Guinea 🤣🤣
Simon and Tobi are so dumb, you don’t lose hair from cancer, you lose it from chemotherapy
ksi at 43:35 had me dying🤣🤣🤣
30:05 Vikkstar Coldest Moments
One of the best sidemen videos of all time!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's French Guiana not French Guinea.
Why tf is there so many ads bruvv
"Two sides of the alphabet" is hilarious from Tobi.
When Simon said I like your trousers got me rolling on the floor 🤣 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
32:54 wii fat
1:33 - Harry says "I pushed the boat out today" - yes, pity it was the Titanic.
I found the sidemen about 2 weeks ago and I think I've watched about 50 of their videos so far. Well done mates.
Harry’s creations of other optional answers make it so good
I wanna see forfeit million pound drop
But u did surprise me with the three virgina question!! Maybe I spoke to soon good job. Never forget where u come from or who came up with u!!
JJ you need to be more apart of your team that got you to where you are at!! Just in this episode made me and ur team realize how distant you are from your team!!😢
39:10  **Money drops**  Jj, Tobi, Ethan and Simon: 🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦🦅
Just came back to watch again The ending is so great even 2 years later
The two thickest in the Sidemen end up with the most money 😂
F you HMRC is the best thing ever said by Sidemen.
50:22 erm actually it's yeah science 🤓🤓🤓
2 planes crashing into one another is the canary island ( Tangarife) crash both planes thought they had clearance
I doubt any of the sidemen will read this comment, but let Harry host all the game shows. It’s so good
Harry hosting>>>>>>>>>>>>
27:15 vikks right
26:14 ez
French guinea hahahah its French Guiana
How in the world two of the most dumbest sidmen walked away with most money. Loved the ending♥️😂
Turn to Christ
43:4 The reason Vik and Josh didnt getvit is cuz it was about josh
Can anyone else hear Simon’s mic out of everyone else’s when he talks
Illumanati what
19:56 DIDNT ASK
I love how the two dumb ones had complete faith and the two smart ones were arguing the whole time
The last part is GOLD
1 million LBS is crazy bro
ksi and ethan were hypeeee
I can’t understand how they don’t realize Canada is a BRITISH COLONY LIKE
40:12 meh all intrest lost
29:58 i think he is taking about pug
9:54 Simon is a very bad person
24:00
Did Simon say he doesn't know where Tenerife is and Tobi said Spain? 😂😂
Video name😊?
Simons mother is an animal is mad 😂😂😂
It's French Guyana not French Guinea, lol
Harry is a wonderful host
"Quantam Physics or LBTQ ICONS" 💀
This was hilarious 😂😂
41:36 why is there a random bevel added here?
THE FACT I LITERALLY KNOW WHAT PLANE CRASH HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AND WHERE IT HAPPENED. Harry and i are plane crash nerds ig
asdasdasda
ANOTHER ONE PLEASEERE
😂😂😂 love it ❤🎉
Here after moresidemen?
French Guyana?
"what is a wombat" It's a bat ?????!?!?!?
Tobi messed up everytime
11:00 Vik just says some maths with chest and everyone believes it even though hes completely wrong
Ah yes, French Guinea ( it’s actually French Guyana)
26:03
I'm happy for Ethan and JJ 😂🤣🤣 Well played boys 😂😂
I feel like there were too much people like for example we saw salt papi once the whole video same with billy wingrove
That Brazil question was answered four times by that one guy on my fyp
I’ve never screamed Tenerife so loud before
Behz is an LGTBQ+ icon? O.o?
josh is dumb
54:50  The boiling point of cow's milk is around 203°F (95°C) so all answers are wrong
ayatipatipadipatepoupidepatipa -Tobi 2022  38:28
tobi most boring sidemen
tobi drier than the sahara desert
like this comment if tobi should be kicked from the sidemen
anyone think tobi is the biggest neek. man vik was roasted for being the worst sidemen but fr nobody would miss tobi if he left hahaha. hope he leaves!!!!
27:40 tobi did something unprecedented
All Vic does is being to bossy Su Vic
Harry is so dumb for that French question and he thinks it’s they’re fault lol upsets me everytime
39:10 humbled
Justice for French Guiana
We need this again
As Canadian I would argue that the answer is Canada because there are two official language English and French 36:17
This has to come back with a 2nd part. :)
225 iranian money that is
Wii Fat bro from Josh was unexpected🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel like we should talk about Harry watching plane crashes more
32:30 Years of memories recalled with wave of nostalgia even though I watch compilation of sidemen gta occasionally
Shoutout for that mention about Malaysia! Where are the Malaysian Sidemen fans?
is that actual real money?
JJ has the highest gameshow payout on the Sdmn gameshows. 225 here, 93 in split or steal and 500k in who wants to be a millionaire 2. Bros rich rich
3rd time watching still a banger🤣
Man got roasted
tobi y tf wud it be basketball
French Guinea… hahahahaha dumbass.. it’s French Guyana
The funniest part to me is the most popular sport by fans is actually football/soccer and it wasn’t even there
“It’s my video” is a sidemen cold moment fr
DO THIS AGAIN WITH HARRY AS HOST
20:40 Tobi's sarcasm combined with jj's laugh absolutely shreds me, this is golden 😂
The way Harry says, "Category." Caht-eh-grey" Absolute W video
39:10 am i the only one calling Vik and Josh stupit and they said that they are good at geography
Who would have thought the 2 brain cells would win this 😩🤣🤣that's some sick twist right there
I feel sad for harry kinda felt like it was his savings
Hey I play table tennis And I am rank 7 in my state for u11
The two dumbest people in the same team is always fun to watch
More of these videos
This episode is One of the best ones
👁
Who wishes for the Bermuda Triangle ?
Wombats are a ball of muscle and claws as long as a bear   They are not small
simon laugh
It was so hard to watch the plane crash one cause i knew the answer 😭
My day gets better when the sidemen upload a video
Simon is sooo stuck up
harry owes jj and Ethan atleast 25K, can’t believe they forgot about it.
Did they just choose Malaysia as a possibility being the longest French border ?? 😂😂😂
French Guinea now in south america😂 thinks it’s guyana
Awesome video
Did no expect that team to get the most money
Knowing the answer was Brazil really made me feel like a genius 😂😂
I honestly don't know how this doesn't have more views
Japan has really low track record of accidents.... Very poor choice😂😂
Bruh really, Malaysia? literally has Asia in it
I never in a million years would have said ethan and jj win by a landslide
“Didn’t ask”💀💀
10:50 i love how they all cheered for wrong maths
The way they all screamed when josh and vik lost 😭
so malaysia is in europe now..😂😂😂
Seriously Vik bruhhhhhhhhh
😂😂
24:24
Bro Harry said a wombat is a bat,being Australian I take big offence
Why was Ethan the lgbtq icon? I must of missed something 🤣🤣
Madddd 😮
We need a number 2 of this but without Jj just in case.
1:01:17 thats a lambo🥺❤
😊
Does anyone know what kind of sneakers Ksi & Tobi has on?
Does france own canada 😂
YouTube getting way too comfortable with these double unskippable ads
I thought they were talking about weight but then remembered they’re british.
32:32 I like how all of them are like processing that ethan is on the question 😂
This is the perfect level of Harry chaos imo.
It was a foul play at the end by Harry and the team BTS, but JJ and Ethan were fated to go home with that much money with both of the last questions, Ethan smashed the previous one while JJ smashed the other one too
12:53 Pan Am the Other airline
12:12 Tenerife
Why does ksi randomly wear glasses and sometimes don't?? does he have contacts on rest of the time??
LGBTQ icons LMAOOOOO
Wii fat is elite 😂😂😂
39:25 “French Guinea”
unpredictable harry game show + unpredictable ethan_JJ ... = this. smashing video :D
lmao it was so much fun. they should done it more
29:20 Vik just completely taking over and saying random bs when Josh asks questions is one of the funniest sidemen moments imo 😂
27:43 Ayo what is Tobi doing?
The France question was so easy 😭
Bro, all of them have very basic general knowledge, some questions are super easy and they struggle 😅
Toby was playing more with the side rather than his teammate
it's always the backbenchers 😭🤣
"Wii fat" 😂😂😂
Banger video tbh, Harry always does the best ones
Japan and terrorism dont go together so it made sense for it to be tenerife.
I love the fact that Harry wears a suit on the top and the bottom he doesn’t finish the suit trouser😂
Why was Ethan on LGBTQ+ question? I didn't get it.
harry goat host
Ethan was moving mad 😂
32:55
Harry as host + Ethan and JJ the winners .... This is the greatest 😂
22:05  as an australian i am horrified
more harry video leader ..please
JJ and Ethan are very underrated
I loved JJ and Ethan teamwork here they had faith and trust in each other unlike the others that doubts each other answers 😂😂😂
Bro harry could be the wholesome host to watch
JJ is smarter than i Thought😄
30:28
💩🤬☠️💀💩🤬☠️💀💩🤬☠️💀
Im really happy for JJ and Ethan😂😍
I was waiting for Harry to yell "Havanese nuts!?"
11:30 that plane crash they talked about was the same one that Walter white talked about in breaking bad
Please do this again
I dont get the french Guinea, the border should be tiny af if they only share that border with Brazil no? U know what I mean right
1:00:18 best moment
knowledge as he said at the start
Well a kangaroo has 3 vaginas apparently
39:08 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
lmao
The dumbest 2 sidemen won the most money 😂
Me screaming Tenerife.
Ethan was cold when he said "its my video"
Rewatching this, still one of best videos and also one of most scuffed video lmao
Can we agree Harry the best host makes funny moments but also chaotic moments too
When harry is the host, the video is already a banger.
Tobey and jj have the same shoes
Harry best host
im offended as an australian that harry thought a wombat was a bat😂
32:45
36:12 ayy Malaysia represent here!😂
These guys are dumb lmao.
okay, that french border question was bs, brazil does not officially border france, so calling it a french border is absurd, but the result was much funnier
Harry means french Guiana, his pronunciation is somewhere in south west asia
ethan and jjs runaround tho
first question was obvious
I knew it was tenerife because of breaking bad 💀☕
i was practically screaming tenerife at my phone on the plane crash question
32:30 huh
Any die hard breaking bad fans knew the answer to the airplane crash question
😂😂😂😂😂😂 am back watching this
What a really stupid question
Of course JJ would know about animal Vaginas
The last question should've been plane crashed!
I like the idea that they get normal pay contracts and then the rest of all their profits from ads and merch and stuff gets pooled into these shows and the money is actually real it's just how they get paid
i hate vickstar they should fire him
What a video 😂 absolute blast
58:57 every game show host ever 😂
Of all the people harry could ask the vagina question to😂😂😂
simon and tobi thought japan had a terrorist attack? really now
32:20 best bit of the video
Olive is lucky charm for behz
PLOT TWIST
When was the didn't ask bit?
Harry’s hosting is brilliant, comedy gold. 😂
I have to say, the outro of sdmn clothing is a masterpeice
Simon and Ethans banter is goated in this video during Simon and Tobi's go
The people who aren't playing should not be able to talk.
TOOO FUN
Loll Vik in that, "just shut up and listen to me" mode, I love it
Underrated vid❤
I didint ask hahahaha
the thing about french guiana border with brazil is that it's actually not just a french territory, it's actually legally just as French as the european france, unlike many overseas territories that have particular jurisdiction in some countries... Residents of French Guiana are full citizens of France and the French Guiana territory is fully a part of France...
i think i've watched this more than 50 times, one of the best videos
20:36
jj doesn't know who won a sidemen video but know which animal has 3 vaginas
18:08
Ethans advice really isn’t helpful at all so simon’s response is justified
Just love the synergy between Ethan and jj
Blinding lights  by the weekend is now the top streamed song on Spotify
JJ AND ETHAN LOL
The question about plane crashes was actually in the braking bad. They mentioned it in the school gym after janes dad crashed two planes
1:00:32 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 that face 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
20:35
39:20 how he says “French Guinea” even though its called “Franchise Guyana” lol 😂
underappreciated video imo
Please remove Tobi from the sidemen. He raped me in a witherspoons.
Harry I wish we could go out for lunch lol it would be chaos because I’m autistic too lol❤
God tier video
Harry is the best game show host on the main channel. Simon on the second channel.
Out of every fact from the previous sidemen reacts video obviously jj remembers the one about 3 vaginas
Bruh. The boiling point of milk it was all wrong 😂 the boiling point is 212°
do they actually get the money lol or is it just for the camera
Whole scene in sidemen coldest moments 20:42
27:41 anyone else see tobi doing hitler salute also as a brazilian I knew it was brazil straight away
19:53 Simon 😂💔 20:41 the revenge 😂 58:35 1:00:08 ofc jj would know😂
Bro are we sliding past the french question? If he would have said french territory it would have been so much more clear
They need to do more gameshows…..
harry is the best host to ever lived
lend me the 25k😭😭
14:42 me literally watching this on mother’s day
make a video about australia
JJ's initial reaction to knowing the last animal question was so funny. "wait. wait. I know this. " it was just so calm and intelegent
i love on how vik said "outside of America how many people play basketball" literally Japan China Europe lmfao
What’s the noice on 35:49-35:51
11:05 what laugh was that
niko avocado is not 5'6 yall hes 6 foot im dead
Wii fat 💀💀
french ginni lmaooo   its french gui (guy) ana (ah-nah)
Back in the day nick avacado was hella fit
4:45 “Shape of me” 💀💀
“Does France own Canada” 💀
KSI IN THE END BAHAHAHAH
so good!! Ethan and JJ such a dope duo
"French Canada"... damn
I'd like to denounce the first question and it's atrocious answers.
I'm in pain knowing they don't know what a wombat is
The boys bullied vikk.
The most unlikely couple won the most money. Well the world is round after all! GGWP!
4:50 shape of me....? 9:55,  19:50,  26:35, 32:50, 39:00, 56:30,
32:20
I was eating ice cream it was brown and y’all just talking about poop
The one time JJ went from JJ to KSI
Out of all of them did not expect Ethan and JJ to win😂
One of the best sidemen videos
FRENCH CANADIAN ARE OWN BY FRANCE??
vik wearing cdl london royal raven merch
1:00:19  JJ voice made me laugh the way he kept saying ‘i know this’ and than starts laughing
Ethan +JJ = great energy
Josh + Vikk= disaster
38:40 it’s Brazil with French new guiniue if I said that right I remember watching something about this a bit ago
Shape of u
20:45
Josh made me wanna start punchin man. annoying af
Ethan and ksi have come a long way in their friendship
20:44 I don't think people understand why JJ laughed here 😂😂😂😂 cos no one's talking about it
The amount of times Harry said french guinea when it's french Guiana 😭😭
it's French Guiana/ Guyana and not French Guinea
Josh saying 'Wii Fat' was savage
I knew it was a heavanese cuz it couldn't be golden doodoo or an australian poopoo .....
19:52  20:40
what is a wombat, i dont know, some form of a bat!!!! hahaha i fkn died
I've hit a wombat with my car once before they are solid animals like hitting a solid rock damaged my car bad
The ultimate underdog story 😂🔥
😂bro holy crap, jj and Ethan’s best performance
i just realized jj won twice
gods plan actually took over spotify streams recently !
Underrated Sidemen Vid along with Jeopardy. Love Harry’s hosting
It was KLM and pan am that we’re involved in the accident don’t worry harry I watch them to😅
There are 3 Guineas, there all in Africa and are sovereign nations. Now, French Guiana is a French and EU region that borders Brazil with which it has France's longest land border. For comparison, French Guiana is actually larger than Scotland and 3/5 the size of England, but it is 95% covered by the Amazon rainforest and has less than 325k inhabitants. It is home to The Kourou Space Center and the EU largest national park.... in South America... with plenty of wild jaguars!!😅
I like when jj gets it right he is unsure everytime
tobi is so funny how they didn't laugh is ole round
As an Aussie, it hurts that they didn’t even know what a wombat is! They aren’t small either! They can flip a truck if they get hit at the wrong angle.
Absolutely butchered the pronunciation of French Guiana 😂
Ethan and JJ were so clutch through this
Can we agree that everyone remembers Josh getting most calories in that challenge right? anyone could have answered correct on that one ffs
19:18 pretty much everybody outside of England Vikk Sorry mate thats a rare L
19:18 pretty much everybody outside of England Vikk Sorry mate thats a rare L
Can someone explain what the lgbtq joke meant?
I literally didn't watch this?
Wait I know this is my favourite 😍
19:53 here’s the moment where the roasting began
We need part 2!!
1525 prolly to i
7:29 uno? Ohh
LIT
I like how Vikk's joke attempts are always a failure!😂
anyone noticed when jj and ethan are playing everytime they get it simon either mumbles something or straight up tries to bring them down ahahaa
I only knew the wombat one because of family guy
the champs...a team comprised of a man who doesn't know how to pronounce the word mural & a man who believes cows drink milk...bloody legends
"Wii Fat bro"
nahhh wii fat is elite 😂
39:20 HARRY MEANT FRENCH GUIANA NOT FRENCH GUINEA (Africa)
The dumbest ones win🤣🤣😂😂
The dumbest won the most
22:23 nobody gonna talk about what Simon said? Ok
1:00:13 IM DEAD! Tobi is holding a carton of apple juice 😂
I need a part 2 of this one
this deserved hall of fame
ethans painful, intriguing that he said tobi and simon were ancient history considering hes never going to be worthy of remembering.
32:20 classic
7:38 is definitely a missed joke 😂💀
never would have expected JJ and Ethan to win a quiz game
Can someone explain the French border question/answer? I looked up French Guinea and it's not even on the same continent as Brazil
I lost my mind when Josh asked if Canada was owned by France. That might be one of the stupidest questions asked in human history
Ffs shape of me
The dumbest sidemen with the dub
32:20 33:02 37:05 38:28
i love how harry was flaming them at 39:35 when it’s actually Guiana not Guinea 😂😂 guinea 🇬🇳 was colonised by France during the colonisation of Africa and it was called French Guinea. It’s not the same as French Guiana (located in south America and borders Suriname ) cant hate bog bro 😂
The plane crash question with Simon and Tobi was obvious. Who the hell thinks that KLM would fly to Japan. It’s obvious that they would go to Tenerife. 😂
I’m pretty sure Josh is thinking about a sharpee
14:56
Funny how the most replayed part is when the icons question ends😂
bro camden is my home town
harry acting like their dumb while calling it french guinea🗿lmao
33:50
32:28
20:37
the question for LGBTQ icons i cant believe they asked a question about Ethan is hilarous with a question about Josh in Ancient History.
Boiling point milk is completely incorrect
Wish I got mcqs on what's a Quark🙂, back in the school days
the desc LOL
Vik, the smart guy: “Let’s go for Monaco, the second smallest country in the world!😃”
what are they shouting at 59:10
KSI being Again A S**** B****
That was fun 😂
On of the best
boiling point of milk is 112 bro
Last part best ❤😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best❤😂😂😂😂
17:21 they only picked vik because Vik would be the one getting spooned no offensive sorry vik
Vik is mad lad
The two dumbest won
"yeah he's whopping" LMAO
Damn.. The smartest pair just lost, and the dumbest pair just won big, who can see this coming
toby's intelligence is the most attractive thing in the world
Underrated video
Ofc JJ knows which animal has 3 vaginas 😂
Viks geography question had me so angry 😂
Your telling me the deadliest plane crash in History happened on the ground?
No where near spain 😂
Trust ksi to know about how many a kangaroo privates has lol omg
JJ very good on vagina lol 😂😂
K in the KSI is real!!
It’s pronounced French guy-yana for those confused about the French border question
That French boarder question was a con, the Brazil-French boarder is around 730km long where as the USA-French boarder is nearly 9000km long... Canada is a french speaking country... another example of getting a reaction for content over the actual correct answer, making the gameshow completely redundant
36:30 that was the funniest question 🤣
The 2 kost unlikely duo to get money off of some questions
Don't know how Ethan and JJ won but they did you'd never believe it.
I don't know how this video didn't get more views, it's actually jokes!
😄
the fact that harry is like with full confidence they wouldnt get it and then jj is like full confidence like ''I KNOW THIS''
"and Simon's mom is an animal" absolute W
I would love to see a bugdet buy race.  Each team will be given a list of items and they will try to buy them at lowest price.  At the end of the day, team with most items and most cash left will win.
1:20 8:00
Ethan and KSI in the final round had my dying
harr tried to mess with lol but failed
Am I the only one who felt fat shamed by KSI? 😅😂
Hhuggk
"Asia's skewed it" - Tobi
French gee-ana is how u say it
loving those sidemen hoodies, only if i could get them from SA😪
Hi
43:38 KSI said that like he's 6 foot 7
Ethan was violated for most of this video😂
I thought they were gonna be dropping heavy stuff. This is better.
is canada owned by the french???? WHAT, NO we are not... fools lol
This video gave us so many meme material. Pure gold this one
Ed Sheeran- Shape of me 😂
I identify as skinny! ;D nikk
Rockstar is the most streamed song on Spotify though
After the final question before the drop. Harry with his hands on his hips... Absolutely devastated, quality!
22:35 saying their instinct on 3 was genius
The avgeek in me screaming Tenerife at that question
Bro how do they pick up the board that dropped on the sides? That's been bothering me the whole video
wait jj is smart
The boiling point of milk question all answers are wrong lol
No wayyy they voted USA 😭
Why tf does it say shape of me???  Btw its not even close man, ed sheeran is dominating spotify rn
1:00:40 Spelled KangAroo wrong lmaoo. Nah but this vid had me rollinggggg
French Guinea is in Africa, French Guiana borders Brazil
I’d let Tobi spoon my mom
*question about French border appears*  Vik and josh: *Tactical Nuke Incoming!*
TOBYS FACE!! hahaha @1:00:25
Viks maths was wrong but everyone still gassed him that’s a good friendship
So many iconic clips in one video
Symptoms of panic shown by W2S “Shi*” Walks around nervously  “Change the question 🙅🏻‍♂️”
Sidemen game shows and hide  n seeks when other YouTubers are involved it’s always fun
When Tobi gives rude shout-outs🤣
JJ and ethan were just combination of wits and memory😂❤
Ive never laughed so hard when Ethan an jj went up man 😂😂😂
Bru just watched Walter white talk about the plane crash right before 😂
10:57 wait they are the same thing right?
Pik dog den
W
that france question was painful, can't believe the geoguessr nerds didn't know about frances enormous empire, DOM TOM innit 🤭🤭🤭  edit: obviously /lh 🙄🙄🙄
Shape of me? did JJ write these?
KANGEROO 😂😂😂😂 but the big screen was right
I knew the plane crash question. But even if I didn’t, the terrorist threat should have given it away. Terrorism is never a lan issue in Japan
After watching tinder USA I second that lol I'd have Vik bang over Tobi anyday lmao
JJ with glasses = knowledge mode
JJ's  and Ethan's energy was crazy 🤣
39:22 MAN JUST SAID FRENCH GUINEA INSTEAD OF FRENCH GUIANA     (srry im a geography nerd lol)
what harry did at the end was just wrong man kinda sad
20:40
Well the plane won would have been easy if I did it it was panam and KLM.
20:45 30:39 29:25
I love when Harry hosts and half the questions end up being about his interests and current hyperfixations lmfaooo
This video made me go and look up a Nick Avocado video, and now I want to invent time travel to stop myself from doing that.
I like vik but I hated him here
Vik is not a team player at all, hes so stubborn
Ok but french guinea/brasil is not a longer border than us/canada
32:54 Josh to ethan : Wii fit nah wii fat bro 💀
20:45 Ethan : simons mother is a animal . That one there was a violation 🏂
Harry: Change the question they know the answer Next questions they knew the answer too 😭😭
Bru I'm American and i got the geography question
Yay Malaysia
😂
32:53 Violation.
Tobi Just drinking his apple juice
I love how my country malaysia is in the question. And not even have related with french border 🤣
ethan and jj is an elite combo
omg 39:08
Am I the only one who knew the plane crash question becasue of breaking bad?
First time that KSI has fr knowledge
"Physics has left the building " epic
39:37 Harry pronounced French "Guiana" wrong lol! It's not French "Guinea"....
Harry said French Guinea borders Brazil, but surely not???? It is French Guyana that borders Brazil not Guinea so yeah Vikk and Josh didn't really deserve to go out!
It was so funny when I and Ethan started jumping together at the end
Ethan got violated a lot during this video.
I think that harry dog breed is incorrect
Here for wii fat
I'm surprised Vik doesn't know about French Guiana
One of the funniest parts is me being Australian knowing very well what a wombat is and then them trying to figure out what a wombat is
Best end possible
Damn Vik was a boss in this video😂😂
24:11
No better pairing in games like these then JJ and Ethan hahah
This video needs more views. I was laughing all through the video every video harry is host.
As an Australian I was so confused when they didn’t know what a wombat was.
1:00:40 they spelt kangaroo wrong on the monitor
Vikk : physics just left the group chat  *the answer was 160kg*  also Vikk : oh wow i didnt know it would be that  why is he still so tryharding to look the smartest in the sidemen? xD
I know this is great content to waste time. I'm enjoying it way too much.  but but BUT... I can't focus on anything else when W2S is looking GOODNIGHT in that light colored suit!  🫠😩🤤
Well, expect the unexpected mates.
Technically ethan and jj answered 9 questions
31:15
22:38 simon and tobi said the same thing just in different ways 😭
We want a part 2 of this, it's my 3rd time watching this😂😂
The disrespect of ethan is so funny 😂😂 what a comeback.
Wii
Bro the french territory question was hard as hell, but saying Monaco? A country the size of a neighbourhood 🤣
I love JJ and Ethan team up, awesome.
honestly the twist where they still rekt it was a perfect ending to me lol
Isn't French Guinea in west africa and brazil in south america tho?
56:53
😆 I said Brazil!
31:21
Tenerife
When Harry says French Guinea when it's French Guyana
Jesus is our saviour ✝❤
JJ & Knowledge: "Food" Josh: "Yea...go back to your roots" raaah
GOD BLESS
"Nice" at the end from Harry - pure pain
no because i knew the plane crash one 😭😭😭
What the hell nick avocado does mot weigh 160 kg he weighs 95kg
The duo that took the biggest and most risks won the more money. Wow.
Questions are always extremely easy or straight up impossible 😂
I love this video so much, I keep coming back and rewatch. I live JJ and Ethan energy.. just making me smile so hard
Proud being malaysia
They struggle with Monaco for gods sake
Vik seemed so pissed
This sports question definitely wrong, the answer was basketball.
JJ and Ethan's energy is madd
I enjoyed the video
I'm jus laughing at how Harry spelt 'bermondsey' 😭😭😭 44:10
no me gusta
Where’s Tenerife   Spain 😂😂😂  It’s owned by Spain but it’s an island near Africa
Wombat is some form of bats ...learned alot thanks harry
When vickstar said coz we care abt u more than 25k
“And simons mother is an animal” Dead
52:40
love how they all turned to vik 😂 May God bless the sidemen
.
Shape of me 😂😂😂
Really really loved this video!!
Bro, JJ is sooo fuckin cool 😍🔥
French Guiana not guinea
I was so happy when I knew the french border with Brazil lol
vik and joshlost everything😭
jj genuinely looked upset when no money was put on him for the mothers question, feel for the guy.
Will smith was fuming when he watch this 🤣💀
Josh’s big brain moment 20:41
I just learned about the Boeing 747 crash watching breaking bad
That question with the french border😑😑😡😡😡
No one's going to talk about how does Harry close the 4th flap back up 🤣🤣🤣
Plane Crashes is such a random category but one that I’d be very excited to get on a game show haha. I was shouting TENERIFE at my screen
French Guiana not guinea
Ethan Is rude telling Simon his mom is an animal..that's not even funny
This show is unreal I am looking forward to the next episode.
Need some WD40 on that drop hinge 😂😂
That dumb joshua
Lgbtq icons 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Harry is so precious 😂❤
Harry:politic or plane crashes My brain:there the same thing
12:03 Albuquerque, New Mexico
im sorry but hwne josh said it wasnt wii fit it was wii fat i died laughing
W2S is a genius! Made ‘em choose between Quantum Physics or LGBTQ icons… 😂
It's always Harry's vids that come up for my next to watch, he bangs as a host every singe time. Prove me wrong
20:37
Wii fat
Tobi cringe afff
Not even funny bro man's just a snake
Most people really don't say C is the low one Simon. Correct yourself bro. Most Man who sit GCSE now can only get a C Max
Imagine JJ pushed the money down the hole 🤣
It's such a well known crash... Even mentioned on Breaking Bad. How did noone know that 😭
I love Harry as a host.
French border: Malaysia Lmao
Harry is the best host in any sdmn show don't @ me
Over smart mf vick jj please bully him more he is acting to much
41:00
Vik could spoon anyone's mum lol
Vikk and zerkaa putting Malaysia and USA as their answers is hurting my brain. Harry calling on French Guinea has sent me into a mental hospital
Its says kangeroo🤣🤣🤣
The LGBTQ icons were killing me 😂😂😂
Love how harry is saying “french guinea” lmao
I think Harry and JJ will make a Goat team anytime
12:10 only if you’d watch Breaking Bad
Bring back the sidemen show
We need this back lmfao this was amazing lmfao
Big W for mocking the LGBTQ
27:43 TOBI SALUTE HITLER?!?!
The only reason i would pick lgbt icons is because ive offended enough of them to know some of the flags😂😂😂
41:52 Harry starts smiling when they rule out the right answer haha
JJ: DROP THE TING!!! DROP THE TING. DROP THE TINGGGG AAaAAAaaaaaa
LOL
Harry and Tobi are my favorites
Who pays them the money or do they not actually play for real money?
Dunno if I’m ur demographic 36 f, but I rate the effort u guys put into vids :) ur all funny and recently sub’d to all ur channels 🙌
Thanks for the help
Ethan and KSI make the best duo LMAO
I think I would get into a fight with JJ if I ever meet him he’s so annoying in these game shows
Not WeFit, WeFat. One of the best Josh jokes in a while.
Ayooo the boys should have been more gassed at ethan and ksi winning where's the love and support
French Guinea is actually in Africa.... he means French Guyane.
It’s not all about knowing. There’s a lot of luck that comes into play.
So many ads just scrolling back
ETHAN has great memory man , he remembers everything so clearly
To be fair ethan and jj’s quetions were too damn easy I knew they will win the highest amount...
45:54 tobi just chilling with his apple juice
I think Josh was talking about pugs...lol
Banger
they did Josh and Vik wrong, french-canada border with the USA is much longer than brazil and guinea feels baaaaad
a true underdog story
40:00
PART 2 NEEDED
I actually remember watching that plane crash documentary lol
6:02 Shape of me is such a good song ngl no wonder it is #1 top streamed song
58:26
I no longer have respect for ksi bc I am 5'6 and about 300 and some pounds due to a condition so honestly ksi can go fudge himself
Such an underrated video
Umn Harry shape of me isn’t a hit song
vik and josh got robbed
19:55 Simon and ethan😂😂😂
20:38 32:20
Ah yes, my favorite LGBTQ icon, Ethan.
Alot of south americans in the comments
Sorry but the french border one was so easy
gray black gray orange gray black black gray white black white white orange gray black gray white white orange gray
Behz and JJs Slumdog Millionaire moment
We need a part 2!!!
The best hosts imo are Harry and Simon. One is really good and the other is really bad 😂
I think I have actually fallen in love with harry
Idk if im the only one but goddamn does vikks personality annoys tf outta me
im an aussie, and seeing that they dont know what a wombat s hurts
When they ask Vick for help with math pure
Just saw where the "simons mother is an animal" meme came from
Vik was playing like he really really needed that money
39:05 32:40 19:51  25:00  29:25
27:43 sus
39:20 It's actually French Guiana/Guyana. Guinea is a different country, so is Papua New Guinea and another Equatorial Guinea. [Yes I'm a Geography nerd :) ]
32:23 😆😬 jj
19:49 TO 20:48  the banter between ethan and simon ... lol ... simon stare thoo
them not getting brazil hurt me
Vik and Josh’s turn when it all drops jjs laugh sounds like a chicken
French Canada isnt owned by france, canada is its own country.
Bro I knew that it was Brazil
Ethan and JJ actually win a trivia game wow
Ah man this video was great
Josh had some big balls today
I watched the one over 6 times that my favourite episode
HOW TF DO THEY NOT KNOW WHAT A WOMBAT IS???
39:35 *French Guyana
Actually would have done really well on this show
Came for ksi stayed for greatness.
do they actually get the money? or is that a lie
that french guyana question made me crazy how vik didnt know it lol
So happy JJ and Ethan won 😂
Ethan Creasing is legit how I would be as well😂
Harry is the best host and vikk a close second...Harrys so spontaneous it's almost impossible to guess how he would react to a situation...
LOL french guinea. ik he meant french guyana but the way it confused everyone was great.
3:39
nahh vikk and josh got screwed over
Eleven will defeat VECNA ❗️❗️❗️❗️
What was JJ laughing at at 20:44?
What in the holy god was this ending?😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was hilarious
it’s funny how harry was helping the smartest people and they lost but was trying to make the dumb ones lose but they are the ones who get the most money
Everyone don’t want jj on their team but he’s alr won a mil with josh and has beat a few other games which the others failed at so idk?😁
26:46 nice one josh that's hilarious mate ahahahahah got the whole room cracking up
Ahahs jeeez the card at 4:52 said shape of me
No way they are keeping the money
49:00
"they know the answer cancel the question" lmao
feel bad for vik and josh because they were RIGHT.  USA-Quebec (French Canada) border - 813km!  Brazil - French Guinea border - 730km
Funny how sidemen reacts also educates them
Harry, Ethan and JJ are honestly just a power team
Dumb team dumb team dumb team 😂😂😂😂
19:52 20:45
Ksi knows how what audience wants. Fast answers like youtube clearly
the last question HAHAHAHA
Monaco is a better guess than Canada or Malaysia bc neither of them border french territories lol
4:53 who tf put shape of me lmao
it's a type of bat. my Australian brothers and sisters.
Remember the k in KSI stands for Knowledge
No one got it when Harry asked a question for ancient history about zerka taunting him that he is old and from ancient -
I think it's time for a sidemen royal rumble or a ladder match
Surprised this isn’t one of their 10M views videos-personally think it makes the top 5 best sidemen Sundays😂
Wrong is French Guiana not French Guinea
These sets are amazing
still my favorite Sidemen Sunday till this day
I’m genuinely upset that I’m only realizing how amazing the content of Sidemen is, literally as of a couple weeks ago. Hats off to the Cast and the Crew of this whole thing, absolutely perfect.
Dropping a million pounds is enough to shake the ground beneath your feet.
12:45 had me dying when harry said a wombat is a type of bat
as an Australian hearing them try to describe/figure out what a wombat is was both hilarious and painful at the same time, especially when vikk kept saying they were small
Harry is elite when it comes to conducting bangers like these, he's just naturally humorous.
Amazing ending 😂
I’m laughing out loud at JJ and Ethan’s energy!
Harry: “Which animal has 3 vaginas” Boss music starts playing Jj: “Muwahaha, my time has come. I know this.”
Josh: These are not very intellectual questions, are they? Harry: Hold my quantum physics
Dam
17
Its so when they mark the areas it does not roll away
Legit team mega minds
4:50 wish vic would shut up so i can hear the dam options
This was actually a good video 😂
58:38 best moment
French Guiana not Guinea
Vikk: Marsupial❌  JJ: Pokemon✅
Vikk is an elite friend
Remember SIDEMEN WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE 2 Harry is the hosts jj wins a lot of money and this video have same vibe at the end
I don’t mean to be this guy but whenever harry said it’s to the nearest degree it would be 101 not 100 because a .5 will round up instead of down
i absolutely dislike josh
A wombat is not a form of bat...
Tobi - what country popularises that sport? Asia
KSI is the Legend 🤣🤣🤣 i cannot stop laughing at "we are all f#cked" 🤣🤣🤣 KSI is my role model. 🦾
ethan and jj won the most Vik and josh lost... i swear to god i would never belive this to happen
ethan: WHOA i dont even know what happened but.. YEAH.. WHOA
Impossible happens
I love how stupid they all are
"nah it was wii fat bro " 😂😂
Mad
That’s a Lambo LMAO, I’m dead.
The Sidemen Highlights 👇  https://youtu.be/c3EZZSbXU7k
When it comes to vagina jj knows it all🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yes, French Guinea, my favorite massive country
🤣❤️
Vikk taking control of the question was weirdly attractive… Also Harry’s trousers😮‍💨
Good video, very good video boys
Wtf is dance monkey 🤣😭
Dude JJ cracks me upppp!!!
JJ AND ETHAN MADE THIS VIDEO TOP TEIR
Knew the Tenerife because of Breaking Bad  Saw the episode where he mentioned it 4 days ago  And also does the these mother fs never heard of french Guyana?
That was BS from Harry smh
Not me searching wombat poo after this
Fun fact, jellyfish are asexual.
French Guiana border*
When harry asked how much funds vik and josh have left and he said 475 its okay lmao
The ending plug for your merch was amazing. I'm considering buying it
lmao the way harry panics "zzz zz cancel the question they know the answer"
Me as an Australian got so mad at how long it took for them to answer the wombat one
Am I dumb or french guinea not in africa miles away from brazil ?
when they called a wombat a type of bat 💀
32:53 best part of this vid 😂
As a Brazilian, I had no idea we bordered that much of France's territory 🤣🤣
Harry should be a gameshow host on the telly.
this was one of the best videos ever
Shape of Me? what😂
Vik is the Smartest BUT WORST Team Player
did anyone notice "shape of me" in the 2nd question? xD
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jj is actuallly so intelligent❤️🫡
ethan and jj is the best 🤣
1:00:11 onwards on repeat
Perfect ending, thought they will lose from first round... Bravest of all
I lost it at Josh's "wii fat" comment XD
i cant believe how easy these quetions are.. it makes me uncomfortable when they dont know the answer
They’re both wrong, french guinea indeed doesnt exist anymore, whilst french guiana does
44:03 Why did the josh birthplace question come in ancient history 🤣😂
How did Ethan and jj manage this ?🤣🤣 what a plot twist
55:00 how would Ethan know, his dad still hasn’t came back with the milk 🥛.
One of the answers for the plane crash one should’ve been Albuquerque New Mexico
38:15
ksi has mad luck man
😭
As an Aussie its hilarious watching them talk about wombats haha
Quantum Physics or LGBTQ icons :,DDDDDDD
29:02 Ethan: "what's that in my pocket? - Nevermind, let's throw it on the floor"
Insane moment at 39:06
I'm not the only person who heard tobi say Asia was a coutry
41:39
Nothing goes wrong in the gamerhood
The 2 dumbest guys won the most money😂 Props to JJ & Ethan tho they got politics,science and animals questions right
50:23 breaking bad refference?
me being malaysian and seeing vik and josh put money on malaysia hahaha, malaysia is in south east asia nowhere near france
20:00
As an aussie, "What is a wombat" Hurts me
People argue about "jj and ethan" having easier questions amongst them,  Remember, this is an brain memory tasks, not solving problems
Thanks!
SHEEESH
5:46 reason i hate simon so much. like why is he so petty and annoying
JJ and Ethan is the most reliable unreliable pair in all of sidemen
HOW DO THEY NOT KNOW WHAT A WOMBAT IS LMAO
Are the Sidemen ever gonna do Hide and seek Again?
screaming and crying when vik and josh put no money on brazil
Vik looks fresh in this vid tf
Funniest ending ever
1:00:25 DROP DA TING!!!!
Quark = when a dog queefs and barks at the same time.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the pain when vik and josh put money on usa and malaysia
Ethan and JJ were like real madrid in the champions league 😭
It’s bad I one bud videos niki literally had a breathing thing and a nurse to monitor him so he didn’t die
39:20 man said guinea instead of guyana
42:36 Flawless logic right there
Part 2
50:28
The editing 🤮
Table tennis 😭
39:25 "EEEEEEEEEEE" Who is that LMAO
nahh table tennis is cap
48:07
Wow harry a wombat is some sort of bat hahaha 😆
Nick Avacado got violated lol.
I love JJ's honesty and how he's not afraid to say his opinion.  No it's not healthy to be that heavy for that height.
Very cool video ❤️
They gained 25k lol
0:27 and 26:23 res fr ... khaliBagh
Out of all the money the contestants lost, ksi lost more on Bitcoin 😂
“it was we fat”
Was the question not the biggest border with France, not a French territory therefore it should have been Monaco
Love this episode! Entertaining and very educational at the same time! ❤️❤️
So noone gonna talk about how he put josh question in ancient history🙂
.....
19:53, 20:45
I just know when ethan said and simons mother is animal ( simon would reply in his thoughts with ) and your dad is a ghost
Harry definetly took the longest french border question from youtube recommended lol
Hai anna iam Nagendar Anna na age 42 misex.Uno qualification m.l.t medical lab technicianf ,Srpt lo jobs unte cheppagalaru anna.with govt Jobs💖💖...
It's unexpected for jj and Ethan to win hahah
19:53
Where is the money coming from though, are they just paying themselves
I feel like basketball was a clear answer
jj still hiding his forehead
I like how tobi & jj wearing the same shoes Simon  & ethan wearing the same shoes and vik,harry & josh wearing the same shoes❤️lovey’all 🤗
surely theres less chance of losing if there are less answers
The switch up on JJ’s and Behz’s moods in the last 5 lmao
32:21
ksi said something based actually, even if it could be controversial, mentioning nick avocados weight as bad, very surprising actually
frech guinea is in africa tho?
Scandals in ancient history
Btw tobi said he’d rather name his own planet than have a cure for anything in the world, he’s always tryna be different
Why did Harry say French Guiana like that
That 25k that was “almost nothing” to these guys would pay off my full college debt haha
“Not a lot of money” = more money than I’ve ever seen
1:00:11 Why does everyone subconsciously know this?!
11:44 I have watched this one so many times!!
1:00:07 JJ’s expression changing slowly 😂😂😂
My inner army was losing it when Ethan and jj started screaming BTS BTS BTS 😂😂
“Can’t have been wii fit.” “Nah it was wii fat bro.”  😂😂😂😂💀
This video just proves that the dumbest people are often the smartest
ethan did so well, jj too i was happy for them they fought through adversity hahahahahaa
Big up jj and ethan
Ethan and jj earned that
vikk neutrons are neutral they have no charge electrons are negative😆
Big up Ethan and JJ😄😄😄😄
Is it not French Guyana not Guinea?
They dont know who nick avocado is?😂😂😂💔🙆🏽‍♀️
Ksi can officially keep his K in his name for knowing the boiling point to milk and "kangaroo vaginas"
20:51 Simon trying hard to hold back the dad joke
Do they actually win the money with these shows? It cant be right?
Haven't finished the video but the thought of jj and Ethan being in one group is funny to me  Edit: well... damn didn't expect that
Where can I get the jacket ethan is wearing? It's not on their website
Such a wholesome finish
Jj's and ethan's happiness is the purest thing I have ever seen
Great episode man.
32:28
20:46
As an Australian- how tf do y’all not know what a wombat is ?
32:55
19:50
Wow table tennis over basketball might be the biggest upset of all time
Am I the only one who doesn't find constantly calling another 20 something old, elderly, ancient, etc., not funny at all? Like, 30 somethings  aren't even old.
"Does France own Canada?" - Josh  No, the Canadian government owns Canada. England still has some kind of hold over Canada, I think, but we're not under their rule, if that makes sense.  But a long time ago, parts of Canada and the US were owned by France. New France. France probably wishes it still owned Canada. The French people might wish that, but they probably just want to be independent. In Quebec at least. I have family there, and I would really hate having to have a passport to go to Quebec.
The automatic war generically look because viola tribally stop round a feeble feigned kitty. better, old-fashioned jury
The "casual audience" are the ones not paying them monthly. I see how it is. Well, I guess I need to get a job so I can pay $12 a month for Side+.
Why would it inherently be something stupid if it were ancient history? Ancient history is fascinating!  I don't know if I believe that Tobi and Simon just so happened to pick scandals and it just so happened to be about that.
HiS ViEwS dOn'T rEpReSeNt Me
imagine joshs born in Peckham he'd be starting his live like yo wag1 blud
JJ has now enough cash for "1k per smile challenge" 😎
”wombat is like a little“ bro they’re like 30kg
Vik: “I’m not Ray J” GOATED RESPONSE
Then ENDING WAS NUTS🎉🎉🎉
French Guinea hasn't existed since 1958 though?
13:50 I only know the answer because of Breaking Bad
Cool 😎
ALL AUSSIES SHOUTING THAT WOMBATS POOP ARE CUBED AHHHH
Jj and ethan getting the W for set 8
Particle physics, not quantum physics.
Man i love this duo
32:20
Icl, I hate how Simon and jj act like road men
"what is a wombat?" "I think it's a kind of bat" me as an Australian....wtf?!?!?!
It would have been an amazing twist if Harry came with a surprise “double or nothing?”.
Best anticlimactic ending ever
SUCK ON THAT HARRY AHAHAHAHA
Every time they talk about Josh being good at geography, just because he played geoguesser - Josh then assures me that he’s good relative to that friend group… cus holy
“A wombat is some form of bat”
That ending lmao🤣🤣🤣
The way Vik says "I wanted some ancient history on my round" and how he looks in 43:57 😂💔💔.
Respect to those who realised Ethan thinks wii fit has boxing on it
Literally listened to the black box down podcast that talks about this plane crash.
woooooowww ethan n jj im impressed their mates are even speechless🤣🤣
is this real money
40:08
27:43 ayo 😳
Simon drinking that Highland Spring
KSI having tics or what ??
As an Australian  my brain straight away knew the wombat questions. They listening to the saying its a bat I was very confused haha
39:37 that random laugh 😂
19:53 Didn’t ask 20:40 no help wats so ever
What is that sound at 39:26?
@10:45 cold....
41:30
How tf is someone like nick avocado still alive? It’s honestly just grotesque at this point
taaable tennes remy shoutout
We need harry as a host more often
really a jellyfish?
I love the way Harry dressed 🥺
I knew this would be funny when jj and Ethan were a team what a funny ending
The way they react to nicks weight 🤣😂😂 they were disgusted
32:18
What got into Vikk this video.
W video
My god josh is most definitely not the smartest
Ethan and JJ, I can’t with them😭
When harry said longest border, I was thinking length or time. Lmao when Vik and Josh put money on Malaysia.
the casual lonely island reference is elite
what a steal to get everyone's favourite LGBTQ icon Ethan Payne
Australians when they said what’s a wombat:😐
All the Indian fans out there who love The Sideman leave a 👍
The last question was made fr jj 💀😂
That French boarder question was worded so terribly. Unfair dude!
Funny how i knew the plane crash question based off mr white talking about it in school after the plane crash saying its not as bad as tenerife crash
nothing was more funnier than harry hitting the stuck plates
Vik is funny they don't give him enough credit!
bruh last question was mad😂😂 Just think about a jelly fish having 3 vaginas 😂😂
Knowledge in ksi really shined this video
Harry: It’s not a lot of money  Me: that’s twice my student loan
https://youtu.be/CiRcupi8umE
Do an episode of QI
The last part was epic!
a good grades 98% a
5:12 😭😂 “aight religion”
JJ’s bandana is growing by the day… only time until it consumes his whole body
this vid is so cool lets go Seattle I am so so cool this is a d/a
41:45 wtf this hint?!
58:29
It’s funny that they forget they r recording and wondering about how the poo comes out cube😭
shape of us
31:20
Malaysia is NOWHERE near the French border ffs
Tommy T out for smoke
keep my wifes hair out your mouth
Harry: which *simon* hit the crossbar first
The fact that vikk is the smart one and was going to put money on Monaco and Malaysia for that French one let alone putting money on USA. Jesus man that’s embarrassing. Logically there was clearly only one answer even if u don’t know the answer for sure
TBH didn't expect JJ and Ethan to win the most fair play tho bang on guesses
How was JJ and Ethan the smartest team
How did they forget French Guinea, come on?
That final question tho LOL
Is this a dumb question? Do they actually get that money? 😂
https://youtu.be/lw5Z6P8-ZzI_  https://youtu.be/YNZoioqi2Ks_
Bro that lgbtq icon question lmaooo
Harry- or did she loose a bet 😂
Man ksi be always baggin the W’s in every challenges even being rich  Feel bad for others…
hold up wait a minute why did jj know that
super out of topic but damn simons sidemen merch tho 💨💨🥵🥵
Vik a legend man
No one realizes that they spelt kangaroo wrong
The way Ethan trust JJ at the end
Amazing video! Such a brilliant ending 🤣
Harry is such a loveable guy man
Knew the plane crash question cause breaking bad
30:25 that was intense on a another level
My favorite sidemen 1, jj 2, harry 3, ethan 4, tobi 5, vik 6, josh     7, simon
Stolen from footasylm
It's French Guiana not Guinea! This part legit made me so mad cause I questioned myself 😂😂😂
love the reaction at the end 🤣🤣 wait I know this
Would've been classic Sidemen if they were celebrating, and got it wrong
teri bhen ki nilami kabb hai?
Glad no one ever asked me Dogs or Maps, hardest question ever

Harry: “To the nearest degree” Answer: 100.5 Me: doesn’t that mean it should be 101?
Again the loaded ones win💯
39:30 : French Guinea ahahah, living in French Guiana, this is hurting. French Guinea is in Africa, French Guiana shares a border with Brasil :)
The ending killed me😂😂😂
42:48 funny joke from Vik no one saw that lol
The fact I thought about the one plane crash I know in history is the question that came up because it was mentioned in breaking bad 😭 shouted Tenerife the second I heard 2 747s
Wii fat🤣🤣🤣🤣
225 that's a lambo! So harry lost 250 on this game😅
1:00:25 harry was in disbelief lol
someone link an image for the wombat poop
bro my man have wroten shape of me
Vik: they r a little marsupial Me being 6 ft 1 and having a wombat come up to my hip weighing more than a motorbike.😂😂
JJ nailed this
in behalf of all Australians I would like an apology for the butchering of wombats in this video!!
Finally KSI uses the K in his name ! 😂
why tf is this in lockdownlifes hoardcore series playlist lol
Viks “Pushin Poo” did not get the credit it deserved lol 24:00

I've never seen someone mix up a shitzu and a Shar-pei
19:56 Ethan Gets Violated by Simon LOL
BRO I FEEL SO BAD FOR ETHAN
I love how jj doesn’t waste time and takes risks
Me having to pause the video for a whole hour because of classes: 😭😭😭
The two underdogs winning😂 I can’t believe this🤣
Nahhhh who let him spell BERMONDSEY like that😭😭😭
Lets be real Ethan did the most work for the team while KSI was just there looking like he didn’t know what to do for the answers
Basketball is more popular than table tenis in china. and mostly across all asia, including europe, americas, africa and australia, that answer is wrong for sure
Goated
Bruh that sound at 39:24
Omg Harry doesnt even know his own answer, its French Guiana, not French Guinea!
At first I wanted to say Josh and Vikk had a good run and banged it, but JJ and Ethan really surprised me, especially JJ
Wait is this real money ?
5:23   Ethan: ''JJ's facials over here are nuts''
Beautiful
Nikocado Avocado is gon' pass away soon so...
Hear me out, we need a Sidemen X Beta Squad abandoned challenge!
how did i get on this i was just watching minecraft then it put me on this
It's written shape of me at 4:45 editor are moving dum
51:40
I love how harry has a nice suit untop but pants on the bottom
I've seen like 50 wombats(but I'm in Australia)
A good after a long time :)
That French question was shocking. Harry acting like everyone should know this. Awful question haha
boiling point of semen is 150 degrees celsius :D
Oi
Sidmene are getting old :D
Bruj jellyfish is not even a mammal 😂
What is Havenese? Havenese nuts in your-
There's no way ethan and jj actually got paid
Babatunde is better than harry at hosting tbh. my opinion though
What a brilliant video. Legendary 🔥😂😂😂
Is it a Pokémon 🤦‍♂️
Now we know JJ will be alright to smile for the next 300pounds laugh challenge 😂
Ofcourse JJ knew about the animal that have 3 vagina
I don’t know French guinea either😂 must be just me
Omg when they did LGBTQ icons😂
Supposedly jj got all this money how come he aint fixed that hairline yet
i didn’t think they would answer two questions to even win
1 2 3 4 5 I am The Greatest Rapper Alive .
A double Z a b
I actually new the Brazilian border with France im suprised josh didn’t tho they share the longest border with France even longer than Germany or spain
Ethan probably thinks the cow drank the milk that his dad was going to get and that’s why he didn’t come back
If JJ and Ethan each know the "last" questions, they deserve the W
Jj and ethan😂
9:44 this quote should be written down to history. Lol
39:21 Harrys wrong too😭 its French Guyana not French Guinea ahhaahahhahaha
Aww Tobi and his apple juice 🍎  🤧
I don't know how this vid just have 6millions vues (still a big number but this video is jokes)
we gonna ignore how tobi called asia a country at 18:52 ???
There playing with like .003% of ksi net worth…..let that sink in
as an australian, i can confirm that wombats are cute bat looking animals
I feel like nobody ever appreciates how smart Ethan is, even though he’s not School smart.
I'm sure Harry is related to Bo Jo somehow .. the way he talks is very similar
Tobi “If we lose I’m used to it, remember I’m a Man U fan too” 😂
Kangeroo??? 😅😅😅😅😅 1:00:41
Josh is so old that he was put under 'Ancient History' category!
What is a Womat.  Harry idk it’s a
the boiling point of milk is 203°F (95°C) so all the options were wrong
1:00:23 is so funny to me
Harry that was a low blow for Josh and vik for that question quantum or the other one
It was KLM and Pan Am
my boooiisss. did the hard subjects, got the additional question. left with the most money with a massive lead. yes lads
why did ksi laugh before ethan said simons mum is an animal
Watching this as a Malaysian makes me curse so much.
no one got that g.i joe / jane from simon 🥲
French Guiana*
“cancel the question because they know the answer” 😂 isn’t that the point of a quiz? 😂
Wow, coming from Tenerife, that one hurt Simon
yyaayayayyaayya
It's not French Guinea - that's in Africa.  It's French Guyana!!
Vik and Josh are so intelligent they were able to hypothesise their own demise
I am literally watching while on holiday in Tenerife, while they are talking about plane crashes here.
The biggest morons won the smart game👁👄👁
Nick avocado is awful but I won't be surprised if there's drama from this question and their comments lol idc personally
I was CONVINCED vik got the dog breed wrong lol
THATS A LIE, BASKETBALL HAS TRIPLE THE FOLLOWING
To be fair jj and ethan had a fair square right answer! But i think they had the easiest question.
What a banger vid
8:00
ik this 😈
kangaroo was spelt wrong on the small tv
slumdog millionaire 😂
hey
19:52
Best moment lmao 20:46
JJ does not miss
Nice
Do Behzs and ks oui keep the money?
Imagine KSI, Ethan, Harry, and Simon doing a Sidemen Reacts to Nick Avocado.
27:40ayo Tobi  Hitler approves
I really thought that Ethan and JJ would do the worst because of the type of duo they were, I stand corrected GG to them
I like how they say they're playing for 1million pounds but they're not.... Maybe if they had contestants that weren't actually from the team I would believe it
Harry mugged jj and Ethan in the end or at least tried
New song by Ed Sheeran - Shape of me! Nice
Shame to the people, I personally loved this video
Vikk and Josh actually had difficult questions
Ethan and his milk man
KSI looked much like his dad with those glasses
Not to hate on the sidemen but this is oddly similar to the game show money drop from Myanmar.
One million pounds, that’s a lot of weight.
Nick is 6'1
Simon throwing away what most would consider life changing money just for the sake of a cancer joke 😂
Josh and Vik helped Simon and tobi the whole time but as soon as it was their go Simon was acting like they had it rough
i want that vest that josh is wearing, i am hoping they drop it on the clothing shop, who else agrees ?
Tobi: the 25 lookin nice
That French border question was harsh. Super confusing and I’d never even heard of French Guiana
39:11 The whole Mickey Mouse Gang after smoking crack
table tennis is back for the real ones😭
Hi
Wow did not see that coming 😂😂😂😂 big ups jj and ethen
All Canadians are in pain watching the question about the french border
which sidemen reacts was the kangaroo question from for research purposes of course
K nowledge  S marts I ntelligence
It's crazy how much they've learned from sidemen reacts
Jj was lowkey annoying when It was Vik and Josh’s turn
Simon: “We’ve only got 100k” Me, with 0.56 in my bank: …
Vikk is so jarring
11:11 I'm with Harry, plane crash documentaries are just awesome!! Seeing harry explain a plane crash wow makes my aviation heart happy
They ain't know about French Guiana?
I literally screamed out Tenerife and French Guinea bro 😂😂😂
Harry its french guiana, not guinea
39:58 Vik so humble man
French guinea is in Africa and Brazil is in South America. What?
put hp and philly on one of these PLEASSSEEEEE
The sidemen truly are amazing. Just top tier content all the time
Congratulations to Ethan for becoming a father ❤️
Ethan won the race to becoming a dad

TBF they had a difficult 1st question. Plus the others were also hard. They deserved the last question.
Latest sidemen today😍
The man with the  strip pyjama..
did josh get smacked or something
Harry kept saying "French Guinea" instead of "French Guiana". The former is in Africa.
"When a dog queefs and barks" 🤣 literally ROFL
Banger of a video
Table tennis
22:54
End of an era 😭
Really good ending!!
6:31 Aircrash investigation 🙌🏻
HMRC watching 👀
20:45 19:52
Sidemen = everything wrong with youth today
Elite video. Had me laughing all the way.
25 mins Into the video, I'm asking myself 'where is the alcohol boys?'
I love how they all think Vik knows the answer to everything, but there are times that when he answers he is still wrong
The sidemen should do a $100 vs $10,000 boat trip
Teneriffe
Being an Australian, Harry calling a wombat a bat hurts me :(
harry says with a smile: “a bad plane crash they almost died”
bro and people used to say jj and ethan still had beef, they literally had the best energy in this vid hahahahahahah
Think this would make a decent vid idea. “I’m a YouTuber get me out of here: The sidemen & The Sidemates”
Could someone explain how French Guinea borders with Brazil? Are they not on 2 different continents??
As an Australian them not knowing what a wombat is is hilarious lol  Harry : some kind of bat? Hahaha
as an australian the wombat one had me laughing
This was, I think, my favourite video. Ethan and JJ at the end 😂
Wombats are from australia
Everybody all ways treat behz and jj as the dumbest. But every gameshow they are on top idk how 😂
Literally unexpected 😭❤️❤️ I’m MEGA happy they won literally
1:00:15 the K in ksi is indeed stands for knowledge
45:55 JJ has a voice crack lmao
who knew the 2 idiots behz and jj would win
20:41 to 20:50 had me rolling 🤣🤣🤣
Harry’s just like boris without the politics
ur next video should be spotlight so spotlight is like hid n seek but at night and u have to use a torch and say spotlight when u spot them there is no rules and u can go anywhere
Honestly that is Josh’s funniest joke I cracked up ahahah wii fat omfg
JJ and Behz make the best team work!
The French gunei was a question I was sure vik and Josh yould get 100% and Bois would be mad and all  It turned out Harry outplayed vikk and Josh and a bit himself 🤣
100.5 degrees would round to 101 not 100 for the nearest
My school made us do a gambling talk and the clip of harry throwing his chair at his computer after packing ronaldo was uses to highlight the rage or whatever excessive gaming and buying of chests lol
ending was wild
to my fellow Man utd fans crying rn please like this comment
violation 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
39:39 lmao tobi "all of a sudden that 25's looking nice"
Instantly knew the wombat one
The bp question triggered me so much
what a banger!!! Great video!
French Guiana*
ethan carried ksi
Look at JJ learn from his mistakes with VIkk and said lets slipt it right at the end of the video lol
I know this is offtopic but Is there anyone here from the USA?? I need a small favour regarding gmail account.
Im a big Geography guy, and when they put no money on Brazil I was crying. They call themselves good at geography, but dont know about French Guinea
This video was muad
44:52 toby just straight up holding Apple juice 😂
YOOOOO this video is sick , harry's questions are amazing.
8:57 The Lonely Island
Really nice gameshow
Everyone got roasted by each other in this vid
am I the only one that saw Vik wink at jj at 32:00
Why was Harry just obsessed with plane crashes he seemed way to happy when that category came up
sideman chase or sidemen tipping point
Can’t lie ethan and ksi deserved it they went for the hardest questions
This is the end of the sidemen
18:30 Tommy t lives in Josh never drown with remy brown
People who are surprised JJ and Ethan won don’t know that sidemen vids do not follow logic
As an Aussie, I’m proud these boys got the wombat question right, cubed poo for the win 🥇
I hope this is not one of the last videos bc of the baby congratulations Ethan but hope baby don’t pull u back from being a YouTuber 💗
Bro the end of that video was so good 😂🤣
all the sidemen r legends but I'm sad to say it's gonna be the beginning of the end I'll never forget them
At 22:09 i found it so funny because im aussie and  wombats are always in my backyard
32:04
Yo this is a banger it's mad it doesn't have more views
For the next sidemen tinder add Santan Dave on to it.
I know this😂😂😂😂
Amazing Ending 😄
New sidemen sunday , sidemen try to be deliveroo deliveres

How did Tobi and Simon guess japan it was literally terrorism, never happens in Japan
Deez
Deez
Vikk is actually insanely smart other than Spain is next to France but Josh was embarrassing
Ethan should’ve asked a cow what the boiling point of milk was since apparently that’s what they drink
😂 gta 5 hasn’t even been released
19:50 😂
Harry's questions are hilarious
That ending was beautiful
Wow behzinga having a baby so cool cheers brother
Should've put a "$" in the title, might've done better in the algorithm
Congratulations ethan!!! Can’t believe he’s having baby!!🥲🥲
JJ and Ethan are an elite duo 😂😂😂 🙌🏽
Us aussie viewers talking at the screen, it's cubed pop bro just pick it
The funny thing is they Ethan and Ksi knew all the questions the other teams didn’t know.
Me and my brah is gesuip and we love your yids pease
Congrats Behz!!!
JJ just turned into Myles Turner
Vikk looks so jealous at the end
one thing that needs to happen again is the football charity match
remember this video as the last ever sidemen video sidemen as  fatherless men
ETHANS GONNA BE A DAD WTF??
10:57 31:23 36:00. Plane crashes choosing
'To the nearest degree...' yet somehow Harry rounded 100.5 to 100
Sidemen Reacts coming in clutch🤣
Silent library pt 2
19:18 NEVER DROWN WITH REMY BROWN
Ksi looking like his brother deji with the glasses

Bro My Brother Is A Round 180kg, 6.2ft 13yrs Old And He Doesn't Look Fat Not Even Fatter Than That Nicole  Guy Person Whatever His Name Is
If harry died alone in a plane crash i would watch it
"Wii Fat" I'm literally dying
Best video
Jj with the penny wise energy at the end
That ending was karma
I would go with quantum thing  than the lgtbq icons
France also borders Netherlands,
anyone else see it say “shape of me”
1:00:30
finding juwairiyyah 🍍
Why is jj complaining he probably make that kind of money in two months
Vik and Josh : Quantum physics  JJ and Ethan : What is W2Ss best gocart lap
Did Harry say a wombat is a bat
14:06
Why is jj intelligent today 😂😂😂😂
this one was crazy. 39:08
i wouldve said tennerife souly because the other 2 were countriess and that is an island in spain
Sidemen should do the no laughing just sounds video it would be so funny !!!
JJ AND ETHAN COME IN CLUTCH
I miss the game shows
Bro pronounced French Guiana wrong
That brought a smile to my face 🤣🤣
39:20 It's French Guiana not French Guinea.
Why am i eating food and listening to the sidemen talk about poo. I actually feel sick
52:18 Toby doing KSI dirty
JJ and Ethan 🤝 underrated duo
JJ and Ethan together are just a vibe😂😂😂
10:44 how does Vikk figure that out on the spot?
"outside of america how many people play basketball" what lmao
The best ending ever 😂🤣
56:13 😭😭😭

Josh moving mad 32:55
Everyone just ignoring how Harry said French Guinea instead of French Guiana. The former hasn’t existed for 60 years
i love how everyone of them is engaging. i wish i was like them with my friends

This is the first game show I knew wall the answers to.
What a legacy there, they actually chose the most difficult categories and then even answered the hard questions. What a Victory 👑  🎉 .
Do yall actually get the money or it's just fake hype
Can we all agree that the two dumbest sidemen really outperformed themselves
15M subs the sidemen are producing a banger video 💯😭❤
37:20
What was that edit at 40:21 ?
Bruh forgot the name of the channel and couldn't even find it on any of their bloody yt channels
The French border question 🤣🤣🤣
20:40  32:50  37:55  39:08
Obviously JJ knows which animal has 3 vaginas.
hej
hej
Was very surprised when Harry asked what his dog was and none of the options said “Rosie”
Anyone else notice josh trying to talk like a road man all of a sudden?
French Guinea's in Africa and Brazil's in South America so colour me confused
ok hear me out, shell shock orl i bet there is a way
Googling wombats poop
Its cool how he never fails to entertain us + never disappoints, and vids are so damm good
Its cool how he never fails to entertain us + never disappoints, and vids are so damm good

What a banger!
"If I lose I'm used to it...I'm a united fan too"...words to live by
32:47
The ending of this video mad my entire DAY😂😂😂❤️
I’m laughing out loud at JJ and Ethan’s energy!
ethan jacket is fire
they quite dumb for such wealthy people
om josh gained weight
Ayyyyyyyyyyy I have a havanese too
the milk question was wrong since he said it was rounded to the nearest so it should of been 101
Broo i enjoyed this video so much
JJ's laugh at 25:10 I couldn't hold it anymore
Tobi and JJ look like brothers. Their shoes,trousers and shirts are so similar.
Tobi and JJ look like brothers. Their shoes,trousers and shirts are so similar.
What is wrong with the sidemen atm their content is great but it’s not getting the views #arethesidemendead
Nice! Nothing beats watching rich people get richer
jj and ethan smashed it
Ethans bar was top tier! Simon swallowed every word😂
JJ needs to go find his real laugh again hahaha
in america they call it ping pong 😂
True knowledge
Harry is a breath of fresh air😍
One of the most enjoyable videos from the sidemen in a long time
“WAIT I KNOW THIS!!!!”😭😭😭😭
It's called French Guyana bro
Can’t stand Ethan such a big standard uk male no originality at all not even funny so boring his voice is even annoying
Next video has to be a Ramadan fasting vid challenge
KSI wearing a glass makes me think he is smart for the first time! 😂
JJ with glasses just hits different
wiifat
Aw Harry hugging Vik because he knew his dog's breed
Ethan and JJ were awesome in this video 😂😂 More of their pairings.
Should do a fans 100k drop
29:49 the funniest moment in this video for me, "that's a bulldog"
feel for harry trying to playing the part of a good quiz show host  going all wrong  for him at the end fair play harry .
Just confirming it was me that wrote that paragraph
“My Music Will Be Noticed One Day”🔝🙏🏽🎶‼️…
Question :- which animal has 3 vaginas???  JJ:- I know this....  Me:- Of course, he knows this 😂😂
Yea I did it but it wasn’t tty
Tobi at the end after waving for few seconds goes like. "Who are we wavin' ?" HAHA
me, a person living in Australia watching them discuss wombats 😭
Damn the ending was heat
30.40 Harry voice crack lol
The Kangaroo question wasn't SidemenReacts, it was the What's Good Podcast 😂😂😂😂
Smartest group got no money and dumbest group got the most money
How does jj manage to finess in all these videos and win ps 😂😂
when they say a wombat is a type of bat…
Mandem are so rich they’re throwing away 25 bags like nothing rah😂
Idk how they lost so much money on that Spotify question that was so obvious to me it’s crazy
Love how Simon and Toni got sports and vik and josh got quantum physics
I knew the answer for the plane question instantly thanks to Breaking Bad.
the wii fat joke got me dead
I … love … this!
Who would've thougut the 2 dumbest would win 😂😂
i guess tobi just got a new deal with apple juice company
39:08 The funniest thing I have seen all day.
Sidemen Reacts really gave KSI Knowledge lmao
best of 2022
I thought that vik and zerka will win
6:43
Is there a frontman out there?
kinda want to watch it again but ik what happens ugh
ksi and ethan atw
Brudda this is my favorite Sidemen Sunday in a whileeeeee
Thanks!
I was so hard laugh when ksi smash chair 38:39 🤣🤣🤣🤣
why was vik so mad
People that watched Braking bad know the plain chast one
poor vik and josh
Was Ethan to short to sit on the chair
Tobi's face 15:03😭😭
jj actually looks really good with glasses
The more I watch Simon the more he pisses me off
1:00:50 i celebrated with them bro....
Kinda sick of Toby ngl
K stands for knowledge. Proved 💯
As an Aussie I was offended when they didn’t know what a Wombat was
It's 3 days after the video dropped and i still have no idea how josh and vik thought the USA bordered French territory, I get that they thought of french Canada but Quebec stopped being a french territory in 1763.
We waiting for the sidemen eid cook/bake off
i loved it when harry said ''nice'' at the end
Only these guys can make these things work I swear. Another good video!
when josh said japan starts with a j 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ik I'm late but are vik and tobi are they mates again or but can some pls let me know bc I'm so confused 💙💜
Ethan and ksi bounced off eachother so well holy crap 😂😂😂
Can we admire how tobi called asia a country
Tobi: “What country popularized that sport?”  Also Tobi: “Asia.” 🤣🤣
Ksi and ethan were elite 😂😂
marsupials if i spelled that right dont push when they poop its strange
Video idea:  Sidemen: Into the Wild - Surviving 48h in the wilderness (teams of 2 or Solo)  (With professionell Equipment)
EASILY THE BEST ENDING EVER
12:08 yo shoutout to Breaking Bad cuz I immediately knew the answer
WE WANT SIDEMEN FEAR FACTOR
Whats the discount code for this week?
These man bore me now..dead ideas. Was a good run👊🏽
Mad how Ethan and Jj slumdog millionaires the end
JJ looks so cute w glasses
50:23
Trick question! "Nick Avacado" is not a person.
20:49 Simon's stare was mad
tenerife, learnt that from breaking bad
This was so good. KSI & Ethan are PEAK 😂
Legit didnt realise Josh was in it till 10 minutes in
70 30 split w Ethan and ksi Init 70 Ethan 30 ksi allow it
Gotta love Harry as host
We need Jidion on the next Tinder IRL!!!!!
this has to be the best ever omg
45:51 Tobi: "Let Ethan pick bro" Ethan: "Stop tryna ruin our fun" lmaooooo
19:53 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣😆
big up man u
Great video, very old school format (just the 7 lads bantering wit each other) and that's kinda what made it great
The way Harry just agrees when Simon said he has curly poop 22:24
One of my favourite gameshows fr
and the rich get richer
every 25k i see im like thats a whole year of work for me
Nah he just said "kennington where it started" 44:14 big up HS
32:56
31:23
The question about the french border was easy af 💀
25:10
Has no one noticed there's something going on with josh n simon
ksi is the goat
1:00:12 it was on the whats good podcast with Harry as the guest lmao I dont know about sidemenreacts though I did not see it there
20:40
do they actually take the money ?
The ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tobi: If we lose, I'm used to it. I'm a United fan too. 😢GGMU♥
i'm suprised that Niko didn't comment on the fact that KSI called himself knowledge
"what is a wombat?" "A kind of Pokemon" 💀
Tobi stay away from your gut
Bruh, I didn't know up until the end if it was french speakers or french territory I would have take USA too if it was that
14:00 Harry gave a great hint saying all the planes had to go to this airport and there is only 2 airports in tenerife
Would love to see Sidemen play American football 🏈
One of the best ones
Looool these absolute idiots French guinea was in west Africa French Guiana is South America 😂😂😂😂
32:19 anybody else feel some nostalgic memories
Logan Paul watching the video being like : Nothing but pain
I am subscribe
"Outside of America who plays basketball?"   Uh, everyone? Just about, lol
Ngl the Ethan “LGBTQ ICON” question caught me so off guard😹😹
i dont get the lgbtq question?
Never doubt the dumb people life lesson😂
This was an absolute banger
Harry being the absolute best host
JJ is the only sidemen that would know what animal has 3 vaginas
At 22:08 it look at JJs arm
When they talk about the size of a wombat and it can actually reach 80 lbs
Sidemen fasting challenge for 24 hours, that would be great video
Because Ethan is what vik???
DO THIS AGAIN. PART 2
I’m a sidemen fan
Going on a vacation to Australia 🇦🇺
Why does it always take me three days to watch a Sunday video I would never know.
Question Category: Acient History All of them: gotta be about Josh.
The way I was judging Ethan and jj for being partners and now I’m dying at them celebrating their win😭😭🤣🤣
my boy Josh is getting back to his old shape
Why was the spelling of "Kangaroo" different on the monitors?
sickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
It was like slum dog millionaire moment at the end 🤣 SlumDogKSI
Damn painful for vik
1:00:31  Harry in absolute shambles
Josh was so funny in this vid🤣🤣🤣
i swear ksi is becoming more smarter the more reacts he does
How do they not know what a Wombat is
God that's a terrible fitting suit jacket haha
Wait so they filmed the water game video here   Ngl that's big brain
That ending was class
The first plane crash question was the one Walter White talked about in his insane speech in Breaking Bad, the boys forgot a legendary television scene
🤗❤️
KSI clutching up for the win. 🔥🔥🔥
ye Nick is insane 5 ft 6 and 160 kg thor right now is 6 ft 9 and weighs less after he got into boxing shape and at one point he was skinnier than the average person
Y is KSI wearing glasses, he really thinks glasses are stylish
Jj and deji are the same with glasses
Who would have thought the dullest were the brightest. JJ and ethan
Do SIDEMEN TASK MASTER...just one episode and try to get the original Team and set That would be sick
16:15
Vikk is so smart
Science or the Alphabet 😂😂😂😂😂
Vikk Mr. Steal ur mom
Vik makes the others look like retards
title shouldve said (ft. KSI) cuz all that money
ॐॐॐॐ
ॐॐॐ
Sidemen reacts to plane crashes
ॐॐॐ
The ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Video idea: sidemen roller skating
20:51 top tier nonce
When he read the 3 Vagina question straight after cancelling the previous q I laughed so hard knowing he finessed it straight from a reacts 🤣🤣
Can anyone link me the jacket Ethan is wearing
Do a sidemen catchphrase
Can u pls tell jj to bring prime in New Zealand
This was easily one of the best Sidemen videos recently and of all time, too jokes
Who wants to tell Harry French Guinea and Brazil are in different continents?
HI out of the 275,000 can i just have £200 to start up my business.PLEASE
josh joke at 32:50 was a violation
the whole part of 32:15 killed me
The rich gets richer🤣
Harry always ruins the game. he always gives hints
JJ always have the biggest luck
JJ was literally the only one who could’ve possibly known which animal had 3 vaginas
Big up Ethan in this video man
Harry: _“Which animal has 3 vaginas”_ *Boss music starts playing* Jj: _“Muwahaha, my time has come. I know this.”_
Amazing ending 😂
Nikocado Avocado is 5 Ft and 6 inches tall for his height and his weight is 95 Kg. 43:23 They just got robbed and yes KSI was right it is almost impossible to be alive like that.
I had to pause the video at 21:50 to compose myself after they agreed a wombat was a type of bat..   Any other Australians do the same?
rigged game lmao
Harry is the best host
'French Guinea' haha it's French Guiana
I live in the only country where wombats live and I didn’t know what their turds we’re shaped like 😂
Harry is the best host hands down
4 bands on Malaysia for that french question 😭😭
Ethan Vs Simon 2023
Discount code 😒
20:43  & 20:51 New Meme Templates XD
Vikk was carrying josh fr 😂😂😂
Dumbest people won the most
28:13 - plz explain
When Simon asked what a wombat is just offended anyone from Australia but understandable
I thought the dog breed question was a setup for 'havenese nuts'
Swear I watch sidemen every time I eat
anyone else notice that in 50:58 in the card it says polotics instead of politics
Bro the ending is elite
Of course KSI knows how mang vaginas things have
Vik carried josh through this
Wii Fat
THE END HAS ME ROLLING 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
Josh with the lonely island reference
KSI being smart at the start If they could walk surely they’d walk at the start
15:00 I think this is the first time I’ve heard Vik’s real laugh
vik gained weight. we love to see it. shes taking care of him😂
Wii fat😂😂😂
Guys is milk cows cu........
Elite video
Ksi is always lucky and will always win somehow
46.7 here Harry get good
people underestimate jj’s knowledge he’s actually so smart ,jj is underrated
a wombat is some form of bat... right
Dead video
Ksi know wierd thing
38:05 KSI- Harry, what was that
Boomer says class vid. K in ksi on smoke
Anyone else confused about the lgbtq icons question?
lmfao
bis mf al lllllll
bis mf al lllll
I’ve watched this 4 times and 3 of them I’ve fell asleep
Ethan’s dance is killing me😭🤣
I love how they use the rust ost for these videos
i really liked jj in this
JJ and Ethan love japanese music their screaming BTS BTS
How the hell woukd the question be answered if ethan knew the answer isnt that the point😂 its amazing when the videos get shithoused i love it
What does spooning mean im not from uk
The ending was like Who Wants To be a Billionaire with josh and JJ
Best ending ever 😂👍
not harry saying french guinea but meaning french guiana
The French border question was so confusingly worded and the country that borders is French Guiana not French Guinea lmao
No one can cancel the sidemen. Never stop the funny jokes lmfao
14:00 That was an easy Breaking Bad question
Vik literally never knows
me as an australian getting to the wombat sheesh "its a little marsupial thing" bruh a wild one came upto me and theyre some big boys
A wholesome moment between Harry and Vik 30:40
GYM ethan
"Nothing saying he looks bad" "Oh nonononono that's bad"
That french border question was worded so stupidly. Like bro "french border" = border with the country France
20:46
It pains me as a Canadian, to hear British ask if Canada is owned by France lmao. We are independent but we used to be a British Colony !
32:56 nahhhhh wii Fat 😂😂 violation😂😂😂
Best sidemen Sunday in a while
Bro when jj said "I know" I died
harry is the best literally
Harry constantly calling Guyana ‘Guinea’ is very annoying icl 😂
hi love the videos
“I don’t think terror when I think Japan”  Mean while America😂
Ah yes good old kangeroo
"I don't know where Tenerife is"   My brain hurts
W Sidemen Sunday
25:17 underrated joke from Tobi😭😭
that finale was so sick
Didn’t ask 😂
What an underrated team! JJ and Ethan too good
Viks teamwork is worse then Man United at the moment. Really just playing solo's instead of duo's
20:20  The spirit of remy brown is still active  Even through the likes of ksi😭  Free up my guy remy brown
did tobi call asia a country???
i feel like vik would've been able to come home with the most money if he was solo
Anyone else find it freaking hilarious that a lgbtq question had to do with Ethan? Lol
Nah when ksi laughed by himself the look around and nobody laughed🥺
so no one gonna talk about french guinea being an african country?
So good to see all the boys back together again😂
How did jj and ethan end up winning the most😂
Loving it
hi
Guinea is a sovereign nation in Africa. French Guinea was an african country that was dissolved in 1958. French Guiana is a French overseas territory in South Africa.
I want JJ's hoodie so bad. Why is it not on the website?
Just gonna put that out there id let Ksi not vik just so I could get a photo with Ksi to flex on my mates
38:02 the way JJ says "Harry?? What was that?? " Like meh mum speakin🤣🤣🤣
French Guiana! That's the one that borders Brazil. Not French Guinea. French Guinea is in West Africa
56:56 😂😂🤣🤣
Not gonna lie lads...this one was a bit boring...it made me fall asleep right after I just woke up.....see ya next week
Josh and vik deserve that loss, smh
20:47 Simon looks like he is actually gonna kill ethan...
29:45
24:01
Laughing at 25k 🥹
1:00:46 "I jump hurdles like Kanagroo's"
JJ and Ethan killed it, goats
Love when JJ and Ethan are paired together 😂👌🏾
whoever wrote these questions is the goooooat
This is one of my favorite Sidemen Sundays in a number of weeks. Top notch 👌🏾🔥
58:56
JJ & Bhez deserved it🔥
couldn't believe the moment Josh and Vik put money on 3 options of a Geography question and managed to get all the wrong options
No Toby I hate manu 😡. Liverpool is the best👍
Japan starts with a J 😂
19:55 Fuckin hell that killed me
Nobody else notice the answer was wrong anyway? Shape of me? What’s that.
why the f did it say shape of me????
Harry messed up the name of French Guiana tho, I was like wtf is French Guinea lmao
58:42 that has to be the coldest sidemen line EVER
35:36 can't tell me JJ's laugh doesn't sound like a moneky xD
Omg awesome idea please 🙏 do a sidemen countdown version like 8/10 cats, sidemen does countdown, please see this comment #sidemen
Plz can I be in a vid my mum got fired and she’s struggling
I was today years old when I found out that French Guinea exists.
Bruh Josh's place of birth for ancient history had me dead
20:40
The power of a crazy teamwork of similar energy
Don’t see why I don’t just spill all your beans 😭
Boo
I was in pain witnessing Josh and Vik failing the Geography question 😭
They way that JJ and Ethan knew both answers at the end was iconic
I loved that geography question cause it was such a mindfuck. I immediately said Brazil though cause of French Guiana 😂
Yes Tobi being the real one as usual😂 #FuckTheHMRC😂
It was actually a very good video. I think they've had some big stinkers lately but this one was dope. Unfortunately they're declining in views big time so hopefully that won't change their mood
1:00:32 this is a face of smn that is proud and at the same time is disappointed
Read my name
Also it’s cubed due to their intestines
malaysia 🇲🇾 ❤️💙🤍💛!!
hilarious
Omfg as an Australian I am dying here while watching the wombat question. ITS CUBED!!! Aaaaah how do they not know it lol.
this video would have been 1:23:10 if josh listened to vik
Do they actually keep the money?
What an ending
in the whats good podcast Simon tells harry about the final kangaroo question (after he saw it in a reacts) and harry says hell write that down for a video
fuq u sidemen
When is the new Tinder video comming?
Skill based match making was enabled
37:04 hmmmm
ig harry was watching pilot mentor?
*Alternate Title* : Ethan getting bullied for one hour
The energy of Ethan & JJ together was magnificent
Vikk really big brained it
Tobi still holding the apple juice
God bless spread the gospel
Josh saying table tennis brought back feelings. Never drown with remy brown
14:06 look at ksi's forehead
so   bad u lot went down hill
Ksi wearing glasses sure brings back memories of old ksi
The best ending!
Yay malaysia gets a mention 😂
😭😭😭😂😂😂
Ethan and JJ broke the curse of always being last especially on games related to intelligence. Proud of them. Loved the vid!!!!
« dont u think vik hit it for the unfair Worders»
Absolute monsterclass by Ethan and JJ
0:00-14:30
32:48 LMAOOO, JOSH'S A LEGEND, THIS MOMENT IS GOATED
1:00:20 JJ's too good at this, lmao
angry will smith noise
“Im actually gassed” 😂😂
is jj and tobi wearing callux shoes
JJ dose not believe or trust him self when coming to the cross bar challenge
JJ and Ethan literally making my day haha
Proof Sidemen reacts is educational
“What country popularises that sport? Asia.” Tobi Brown
w team ethan ksi
Malaysia
vikstars jokes are so forced
josh fudged vik's chances :((
Can someone explain the geography question that vikk and Josh got because I don’t understand how French Guinea shares a border with Brazil ?
Can someone explain the geography question that vikk and Josh got because I don’t understand how French Guinea shares a border with Brazil ?
I like how they just start talking about cubed poo
The set should be a more lively rather than a big area with same 2 colours on the wall
Bro what is their budget on these videos 💀
sooooooooo sick
And harry still one of my favourite hosts for these kind of games👌
JJ and ethan are elite... them as a team is so fun to watch.
I really thought jj and ethan will suck in Q&A but they literally smashed it🔥
Fav part by Ethan: 38:14
We not gonna talk about the spelling of Kang"e"roo? Lmao. Right on the big screen wrong on the small screen
39:27 wtf is that sound
I was waiting for the kangaroo question the hole video since he said he was going to ask it on what's good podcast 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The way simon thought positive at 14:00 is amazing
Does he mean French Guyana? Not Guinea
The ending is EVERYTHING 🔥😂😂😂
44:00 poor vikk
French Guyana shares a border with Brazil, French Guinea is in Africa XD
As an Australian I didn't realise the lack of knowledge about Australian animals in other countries 😂
jj looks even better with glasess
The fact they have this money to give away makes me upset :(
broo i lost it at wii fat XD
is nobody gonna talk about how Harry said French Guinea instead of French Guiana
I GOT SCAMMED FROM XIX VODKA
Harry did JJ and Ethan dirty
27:42 ayo tobi
We need a sidemen catchphrase
The game shows are so dead
Hahaha JJ and Ethan to funny in this one 😂😂
Bruh i know vik is smart, but he need to put down his ego. Its a team play so josh need some reasons too. Cause hes indian doesnt mean that hes always right.
My mans said all liquid boil at 100°C and still managed to win this is outrageous
Tobi: “ Knowledge, si ”😂
That wombat scene annoyed me and many other Aussies
Bro KSI keeps winning like 90% of these challenges 😂😂😂
Is Canada owned by France 🤦‍♂️
How ironic. The smartest team lost everything and the dumbest team won heaps of $$$
LMFAOOOOO 32:30
JJ wore glasses which explains how they won so much money.. He came in CLUTCH!
Back benchers coming at end to clutch🔥
As a French person the longest border with France is a well known fact I knew the answer before the option but it is a difficult one for non-French people, maybe Harry could have given 1 more hint ^^
Real ones know that Vikk took the photo for the thumbnail
I do not like side-on
20:40 the best moment 😂😂
I know this 😂😂😂
Hffhjnccdsyjb
They ain’t seen breaking bad
Josh asked the spotify question on stream right?
Josh rly gotta listen to vik
the ending was class tbf
How many people play basketball outside USA? Vik broo
Yo idk how but jj always kinda gets away with everything lol
Finally… a banger of a video!
10:36 Big Brain moment from Vik, Impressive :D
Guys do cluedo irl I think that would be rly fun
All the recent sidemen videos seems staged.
Harry's geoguesser skills coming out at 38:23
Hey guys estelle said u have a lot of money already and was wondering if u would give us the money u guys won?
Nothing’s better than sitting on the balcony of your 5 star hotel room, watching a sideman Sunday
JJ in glasses is such a vibe I’m here for it 👌🏼
absolutely LOVED this video
This deserves
Well, well, well. Guess the K in KSI is knowledge after all lol.
im actually curious who builds these sets, or where they go to film this stuff
Secure the bag 🎒 footasulm
Tobi "What country popularises ping pong? Asia".......
alwayS good to See theSe people.
Lets do a sidemen turn into dragqueens And have famous dragqueens from uk do your transformations its gonna be hilarious
Fuckin sidemen
Shame Nikocado Avocado part had me dying in laughter
Toni casually holding apple juice
footasylum did it better
french guinee??? *guyana!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do they actually keep the money ?
9:01 even I was hoping for the same😂😂
If there are 4 answers to choose from it’s harder
58:30 Simon helped Ethan 🤣
The fact that Josh and vikkstar chose Monaco and US.  DISGUSTING MATE 😂😉😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lots of jokes in this one. banger💯
Harry is amazing at presenting😂😂
Nobody talking about how Guinea is in Africa and doesn’t border Brazil?
Yes
that ending is mad fam
10:44 I like how they praise Vik when he just said something with common sense
Investing, saving & spending are all choices;  Choices are made when decisions are taken;
35:45
can u donat 100 pounds to me bro, I like ksi not jack pal
HARRY LMAO
Simon: what is a wombat? Harry: it’s some type of bat
Harry always with the bangers 😂
watching JJ answer the milk question is KILLING me. my god
Josh says wii fat😂😂that got me right there🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great video loved it...
lol the ending. even after that sabotage
this is bloody amazing  great vid
Taaaable Tennis- Never Drown With Remy Brown
one of one youtube video that made me actually laugh and fall of my chair
Irony the dumbest people in the group won 😂😂😂
kick Tobi already JEEZ
That's why josh asked that same question on stream
😂😂😂😂I so much love how Ethan and JJ won even though Harry tried to make them lose. “I KNOW THIS” in JJ’s tone🤝😄
Tobi is lame and cringe like real cringe not the funny cringe
French Guyana*
the team we all thought would do the

Waiting for a new tinder video 🔥 please make a tinder video
45:12 that's mad
Bruh how y’all not know what a wombat is
Vik with the ✨main character✨ energy
1:00:41 Kangeroo is spelt the Harry way, 1:00:43 Kangaroo is spelt the right way
Boiling point of milk is 95 degrees Celsius
This is a straight-up banger
its always good to  have a nerd in a group
Harryss devastated
vik is the goat
14:29
Knowledge Studious Intellectual- KSI
14
That end bit was a holla
Lmao harry said frecnh guinea instead of french guyana...
That was like slumdog millionaire
Best game show host
The best part is 39:20 when Harry says "French Guinea" mocking Josh and Vik as if he's ever heard of it when the country's name is pronounced completely differently
11:16 made me choke on my mtn dew
Can we talk about JJ’s drip with the glasses?
harry hosting a video is always hilarious
Yessir
the fact that Harry thinks its French Guinea when its French Guyana and he's calling them dumb is killing me
sidemen vids have been so dead for like 6 months straight these dickriding year 6s are inflating their heads they can just post anything and get 10 mil views these vids are soo fukcin boring
1:00:10
58:56
KSI Rap is amazing
Wow what an ending 👏
do sidemen try to fasting
Broo when Harry said "Cancel the question they know the answer" and jogged away i DIED 🤣🤣🤣 he really didn't want them to win.
whats the discount code?
Only game shows orchestrated by Harry are the ones KSI has a legit winning chance in
They call em knowledge for a reason
46:15
Ethan: There's nothing bad with being fat  KSI: Nah its bad
42:04
38:08
37:05
As a malaysian, I still wonder why vik and josh gamble on Malaysia for french border question . we had nothing to with france 😂😂
36:00
finishes with the spelling kangeroo
35:00
34:22
32:55
now jj has a video of him actually being smart
31:33
30:11
25:15
i thought josh and vikk were robbed for a moment. French guiana is pronounced guy-anna and is very different from french guinea, which is was part of africa during peak colonization. I was abt to be angry for them XD
20:41
19:55
Ract makes them smarter !!!
20:39 the most funniest part of this video 🤣🥶
2:10
All the Australians watching them struggle to find out what a wombat is 💀💀💀
Anyone else catch Tobi @25:18 he says “ it’s either science or the alphabet “ I’m dead😂
vik's source: "trust me bro"
The only reason I knew the plane crash one with Simon and Tobi is because of the breaking bad scene 😅
Elite video
What an unbelievable ending! Truly awesome video haha
Does anyone know what reacts the jellyfish is  in?
Another KSI masterclass
Yall might not see this but we need another hide and seek
Love Harry as a Host ❤️👌🏻
Thanks!
videos are soo better without callux, randi and calfreezy
I HATE NICK AVACODO
As an Australian I am deeply offended by Harry saying “ a wombat must be some type of bat” lmao
Loved the whole thing now in that kangaroos has 3 viginas
Josh wasn't in his brightest in that day
Harry means French Guiana and not French Guinea
🔥
2024?
Petition to get thogdad in the next sidemen tinder. 🔝👍
BIG UP JJ AND ETHAN FOR WINNING MORE MONEY IN THE END!
Madera effect, I thought milk boiled at 60 too
W for vikk wearing a london royal ravens jacket
The trust of Ethan on JJ at the end 🔥🔥🔥
Don’t u mean 1 million dollars
Can I just ask what Harry's trousers are?
It’s French Guiana not guinea
JJ really can’t lose…. 😅
He says to the nearest degree at 55:13 then at 57:53  he says 100.5 degrees it would be rounded to 101
French Guiana guys omggg such pain
Harry is the goat presenter
39:19 Nobody caught W2S's mistake. I think he also didn't know anything about a French Territory near Brazil. I'm from Guyana. Which is pronounced as it sounds (Guy Ana). We share a border with Brazil, the same as the French territory... French Guiana. Guiana is pronounced the same as (Guy Ana). Harry called it French Guinea or (Gei Nee). That's wrong. Guinea is a country in Africa and its NOT French. Just a bit of Knowledge in a game with Trivia.
20:48 i was afraid simon was gonna pull a will smith on ethan
what was the discount code tho ?
The boys have come a long way
Somone explain Ethan lgbtq segment
French Guiana, not French Guinea;)))  Josh is sick at GeoGuessr, but I knew they were gonna get that one wrong haha
Hahahahaha the broken flap
The producer making sure the wrong answer was never the broken one 👀🐟👀
JJ really cant lose 😂
Can we all agree that vlogs and holiday videos are so much more entertaining than the other, no hate but these are stinkers for me
Jj eyes twitching every 5 seconds
Harry is a living legend 😭
Yo
Man U Jjst reminded me how good the million pound drop was lol ppls faces = priceless
This programme
how the hell almost jj wins in every game show xd
I really don't like vik stuck up t**t
Sidemen vid on my birthday, perfect gift
Malaysia, located in south east asia, definitely borders France 😂
Harry is bullying Ethan and JJ
8:58
What woulda thunk that the team of JJ and Ethan would know the most trivia
anyone else know the Tenerife one from breaking bad?
who put 50p in vik?
Amazing video top 10 sidemen sunday ever
There no I in team, but there sure is one in Vik
what an episode🔥
Harry is so cute as a host hahaha wholesome video <3
Tobi always the guy to clap first.  I bet he claps when the plane lands
Swag. But not the backdrop bruv lol the red and curvy ain’t cool lookin stuff.
damn i gotta watch more reacts xD
Tobi filmed his car wrap after this
NOT FRENCH "GUINEA"  😭😭
56:30 Indeed he has knowledge strength and integrity
love sidemen game shows
56:57 had me CRYING them doing Stormzy 😭😭😭😭😭 vio
from diss tracks to duo dubs lol
If Josh says “man said” one more time I’m gonna punch my screen
Lol they just copied footasylum, but good content though.
Harry:wombat?? Some sort of bat!
LOVE TO SEE THAT EVERY BODY IN THE SIDMEN HAS A BEARD EXCEPT JJ     TOBI IS EXCUDED AS HE DOSNT WANT ONE LMOA
I swear its french Guyana 😭😭😭 39:30
16:10 vik’s subtle response after hearing everyone would let him spoon their mom 😂🤣
When it was the lgbt icons question, the question was about Ethan? lol 😂
They're reacting like they're actually winning the money this time 👀
Drop the thing
It’s always the “dumbest” sidemen that win the most 😂😂 Ethan and JJ are a great team 浪
1:00:43 when your steaming and Mr.Brightside comes on
what shoes is jj wearing
This one’s a BANGER
Jj looks like his dad and brother when he has glasses on
@2:46 loool bless Simon, it’s as if he thought it may be a “4c hair topic” with the what’s tresemme? ☺️
JJ somehow always comes out winning LMAO Well done lads !!
Someone explain the lqbtq icon joke???
8:58 josh throwing a old fouseytube song into it
4:42 ‘shape of me’ 🙌🏼
Quiet noice video
Cubed poo is similar to brown sugar cube- Thanks to Ethan I’m sticking with white sugar from now on 😂😂
Droooop the ting😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😂😂
I like how Reacts have made the Sidemen more knowledgeable 😂
me just sitting here knowing i would've won more than 500k lol
Odds on the sidemen giving me a cheeky 25 bags ?
Unreal stuff Ethan and JJ 😂😂👏❤️
Josh and Vikk's reasoning for the French border question was painful to watch.
am i being silly or was it real money
jj should rock the glasses more cl
We need "who is the strongest sideman 3" video. Sidemen or moresidemen
14:20 did anyone notice KSI’s blinking…?
lava hound then guards
Gut
🤣🤣🤣
I really got scared by vik because of everyone else’s reactions against him going all for it on Havanese
And that's what I call progress m'dudes! Go Ethan and JJ!
Imagine not instantly knowing wombats have cubed poo.  Couldn't be me.
That hurt a lot when vikn josh's money DROPPED .... WHAT A BANGING VIDEO THO ... SDMN ❣️
What'd Josh mean by that? Didn't understand what was so funny about it 20:41
Sidemen reacts are actually really have educating videos
The way josh said wii fat had me creasing
Wii Fat
milk boils at 212 tf ahahhahaahahahha
I wish I could do this type of content with my freinds
Shape of me
Harry🐐🐐🐐🐐
Nickocado < Amber Lynn Reid
What's funny is that I knew Nick Avocado's weight because I weigh ~140kg and he weighs more than me, so it could only be 160kg.
A BANGER VIDEO
33:52 That’s Tommy T speaking
48:40 - heres your answer https://youtu.be/O1oGMX6lO10?t=14 xD
even I knew that Harry’s dog was havanese and I haven’t even ever seen the dog 😂😂😂😂
Mad how sidemen reacts has been wonderfully educational for them all 🙌🏼😅
Mad video
5:22 I thought KSI had is hand on Josh’s thigh 😂😂😂
Clear your grease and relax with the sound of nature
The French border question made me so mad AAAAAH
Sidemen Tinder: U.S version
Canada and USA have the longest land border on the world. 1 of Canada’s official languages is French. The answer was USA.
WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED
JJ n Ethan just banged it the end. What a drop.
Tobi:  “Why are we waving?” 🤣🤣
What an ending!! 😂😂😂
Who else after Tobi and Simon won searched up a wombats poop?
Well this proves that Ksi has gathered “Knowledge” from his surroundings and used it to his benefits 👏
Behz and KSI doing the big-brain ting...
was that a freestyle? 57:10
Nah Ethan was too jokes on this one 🤣🤣
Vik was acc soo funny in this 🤣🤣🤣
12:32 isn't it Tenerife
Ethan and JJ are so funny together. Harry as host always has the weirdest questions. Great video
40:30
When jj laughs i think about Scooby-doo😂😂😂😂
How did they not know about Tenerife man😭
This is actually such a class video, loved it
Me at the bts concert two days ago: 59:09
Viks a melt.
Jj screaming drop da ting while Ethan danced around was the funniest thing ever 😂
“25 on the queef fellas” is probably my favourite quote from Ethan
no one:   Harry: plane crashes 😄
JJ and Ethan are such an entertaining duo to watch do trivia questions together
20:45
Living near to buckmore park thinking I could race against them is mad. Odds on for a sidemen and fan race for sidemen Sunday?
I was NOT expecting Ethan and JJ to do so good
Omg this was the best TV show in the history...
The moment when nick avocado sees this…
The fact that Ethan got the food question without hesitation and JJ got the vagina one without hesitation is so befitting.
Simon shouldnt be rude to ethan, he has been passive aggressive with him in a lot of vidoes.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔪
NUMBER 2 ON TRENDING LESS GOOO
19:52 every sidemen fan reply on twitter lol
Everyone looks so defeated lol. What a dub. Got robbed and still came out on top
20:04  *SIMON PROCEEDS TO CHEAT ON JJ* JJ: GET OFF HIM BRUV! Simon: Okay 😞
Harry said "French Guinea" when he meant French Guiana💀
Wish we got more things like then rather than a hide and seek. This was a 10/10 video!
I can’t believe vikk didn’t know about French Guiana, like what it’s an actual part of France
The energy in this video was kinda weird somehow
Im always happy when the Sidemen uploads another banger
The answer hasn’t been revealed yet but it’s Brazil
Obviously it was Ed Sheehan. Drake and post malone got nothing on Eddy boy
“A wombat is like a Pokémon” … I can feel Australia’s collective facepalm
When i heard Ethan for a LGBTQ Icon, I lost it
Its a marsupial, "that doesnt help". Its like a pokemon, "Yes!" 🤣
These lot dropped off
JJ and Ethan definitely got their 10k steps that day!
i almost spit out my coffee when Vik started singing Havana LMAO
Vik lowkey irritating in this u kno 😬
43:40
24:08
Nah, that twist at the end, Harry canceling the question because Ethan knows the answer, only to have JJ know the answer to the other question. That's some real karma lmao
The sidemen gassing Vik up for being smart when he's wrong about the probabilities is too funny
And this is how the rich get richer
Gotta love vik
Tayyble tennis
32:03 Toby’s face after JJs drop 💀
ofc KSI knows what animal has 3 vaginas lmfaoooo
Yo, can we all agree on that KSI is genuinely a money machine? The guy literally can't lose
Harry Its Spain not Brizil….
Which animal has 3 vaginas? A kangaroo or a jellyfish. I KNOW THIS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"geograf" - 28:25
Harry is the best host. Then Simon.
The only channel that can make me watch an hour long video on YouTube!!
i know this 😂
Table tennis is most certainly not more popular than basketball
Best sidemen Sunday in awhile, great video guys🔥🔥
Honestly telling jj and Ethan is the best duo ever 👍👍👍😎😎😎
This was so good
JJ and Ethan made this video 110% first Ethan clutched it then JJ clutches after they got screwed. Sidemen videos are getting better and better I swear
I don't see why to be happy about winning own money lmao
The fact that jj was still giggling at the 3rd option on the first round is hilarious😂
Of course JJ would know which animal has 3 vaginas lmfao
I prefer to watch BETA SQUAD  the sidemen is dying slowly like if agree 👍🏿
this one was fun
Harry needs to host these more often 😂
Vik and Josh walking away with nothing while Ethan and JJ walking away with bags was something I didn’t expect for sure 😅 could also be massively more if JJ just went with it each time. I mean he knew the Avocado and the Milk one.
Very worth my one hour 😂
ethan and jj my goats 😭
The ending was so satisfying to watch hahaha
Harry what happened to supporting Chelsea?
🤣
32:54 best one
the last two questions are heaven.
How hey not know, Canada is a part of the British Commonwealth like Australia
Let's go London
Im just wondering how they get this money
The end😂😂😂
32:28
Rooting for ksi and Ethan was fkin awesome,  let's go! Love this video 😂😂😂
Yall got to play Pico Park
29:02
Nah im sorry but how did vik and josh not know that?  Also Ethan and JJ deserved the win
To be fair tho
Why is JJ wearing glasses?
harry’s interest with plane crashes suprised me cause i literally been watching plane crash documentaries these past few days 😭
why is being part of the lgbtq community considered a joke? i like the sidemen but that was just insensitive
BS is table tennis bigger than basketball, in terms of fans, questionable sources there Harry
Good
Why the hell is it shape of me 😂😂😂
milk boiling point is 212°f
I always see that when Harry is the host he never laughs at jokes ….he is pretty decent at it 👍👍👍
4:52 shape of me
wroth all my time i havent laughed like this in a while.
Warra shock the two idiots are the ones who walked away with the most bread looooool😂😂😂😂Ethan doing the Stormzy run killed me the amount of times he does that on stage man haha😆😆😆😆
My mam said 60
This was jokes
In a game like this, doesnt giving them less answers to chose from as the rounds go on make it easier?
good video boys
Ik that plane question from breaking bad lol
Unbelievable vid best I’ve seen
JJ Just loves money 💰 🤑 💸
'didn't ask!'
Jj and Ethan carried each other
The fact that jj knew the last question didn't surprise me at all lmaooo
17:00 (personal timestamp)
Golf is definitely WAY more popular than fuckin table tennis
they actually win the money?
im danish can JJ still remember EyeQ
boiling point off milk is 95°
didn’t even spell berms right👎🏾
so now we ain't getting censored moments. It's just cut out from the video. 20:42
Never drown with rummy brown "table tennis"
Haven’t got a clue how Harry’s got “French Guinea” from “French Guiana”😭😭
Malaysians be like , WTF bro.. we asean .. hahahahaha
Its a saying "The Rich Get Richer"......
French Guinea is in Africa Brazil is in South America wtf no one picked up on that ????
We all have to agree the team we all thought wouldn't win anything...got the most out of it..  Really happy for them..😊
Harry’s face at the end is priceless 🤣
yeah
Is it real money?
I have alopecia …….. bro just don’t
47:44-49:48 BIG nostalgia trip
jj full droped it
Sorry lads. Stinker. Two in a row.
This is way better than I thought it was going to be haha
putting the 2 big brains jj and ethan in a team isn't fair man
Bruh i laughed so hard when they asked Ethan's favorite game under LGBTQ Icons 😂💀
anyone else notice the "kangeroo"
39:26
Hi
I would have smashed d monitor if I was Vick r Josh 🔥
Vik and Josh only got tough questions. They also deserve better or give tough questions to other teams also. This is not fair
No discount code?
Superb !!
Do they actually keep the money?
Good luck in the 24 hours of silverstone in may
Of course JJ knows which animal has 3 vaginas
Well hello from malaysia ig ahahahhaha
Tobi should start a apple juice brand(company)
12:45 Harry story telling, im dying
The last question their moment was tooo coldd
20:26 table tennis?? Asia??
Wow new game show love it boys😁😄
Josh saying “table tennis” we miss remy brown
*"CANCEL THE QUESTION"*  😭😭😭😭😭
17:56 how’s laugh is that?
1:00:41 no way harry spelt Kangaroo as "Kangeroo"
we need more of this shows plsss🔥🔥🔥💯💯
What a fuckin video godaaam ksi and ethan duo always getting the dub W 😍🤣🤣🤣
Let's be real tho, KSI has one literally most of the money competition vids
20:40
Walter White would know all about that plane crash
the way josh just said about ethan, 'no it was wii fat' had me dead 💀
Simon being super competitive as usual 🤣
Lads, its another gameshow, and Harry is the host. This only means one thing😅😅😅...(put it in the replies).
Is anyone noticing sidemen are making couple of videos in one dressup??? maybe they are shooting those in one single day!
43:40, I mean, a woman did die in the background of one of his videos...
JJ again with the DUB!!!! Didn't he just won a Lambo on the older video?
VIK and Josh look like clowns after that 🤣🤣🤣
Harry is the best
Josh is more savage nowadays and I am here for it 😂😂😂
This may be stupid, but isn’t French Guinea in Africa
I like how the only version of these games I know is the sidemen versions
Table tennis never drown with remy brown
What a TV series and what a take on the TV game show by the sidemen boys, I'm glad I'm here still watching and supporting the boys <3
the last question remind me of the other trivia vids when jj team up w josh, where the last question is related to josh 😂😂😂
That ending 😂
VIK SAYING SEE ALL YOUR MUMS LATER GOATED
S.A.S…WHO DARE WINS (SIDEMEN EDITION)
Who would’ve thought that jj and ethan would have been the dynamic duo
OMG the way he said "I know this" I died from laughter lmaaaooo
I really want that white hoodie Jj is wearing. Could a Sidemen clothing rep hit me up with a hook up please 🥺
Ethan and JJ were so wholesome ❤️
Sometimes its just hurts watching them get really easy questions wrong
6:12 couldn’t ask for a more supportive audience and host
Never drown with Remy Brown
Milk does not boil at 100.5 degrees celsius. It boils at 95 degrees celsius.
" i didnt hit it first im not ray j " Vik
french guinea is in west africa bro lmao
10:45 nah Vik’s messed up there as it’s the other way around
Sidemen The Price is Right for a sidemen sunday idea?
harry tried it at the end tbf, but fair play to ksi and behz they killed it
basketball has more viewers tho...
That question at 39:00 was the dumbest question ever asked, so complicated and not understandable
40:00
Finnaly an good Video lmao
this team is the luckiest
cancer of the head i'm two minutes in and ive pissed myself
Ahhh the rich get richer 🤣
32:00
This is the best video great job sidemem
simon is so mean, it ruins this hilarious video
🔥💕👍
WiiFat.. omg..
As a Canadian I am disappointed. 🤦🏻‍♀️
This was amazing having watched that  video where they talked about the 3 vaginas to then see the last question 😂😂😂
Jj and ethan were balling hard on those questions real well.
Yo is KSI ok? He’s blinking quite hard during Simon and Tobis turn
I started eating when they were talking about the 💩🤢
KangEroo 😂😂
first off, great video i love the sidemen, but is it just me or does anyone else notice that table tennis has alot less fans then basketball globally, roughly 850million people are fans of table tennis globally whereas roughly 2.2billion people are fans of basketball globally
i love vik in this
25:15 tobi: “it’s the science or the alphabet” 💀💀
We want football match sdmn vs youtube
So basically sidemen recorded this, then they did 2 videos for moresidemen channel in the exact same location, right?
39:10 it's French territory French Guyana if I was there I was gonna win
Im not  Fan
Why does JJ look so good with glasses ?
Bangin video, low key cut about the calorie challenge faking reveal at the end though lmao
No one :- Literally no one :-   Sidemen:- decision about bat poo 🤣🤣
Sideman ramadan fast
Side man ramadan
Next week video sidemen fast for ramadan for a day
French Guinea lmao
Love the facts that Vik know his friends well👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
kanker dom
Harry as the host was just the best😂😂
At th starting it was shape of me lmao
3 videos 1 shoot
ngl jj be lookin smooth with the glasses
JJ doing the dragrace move gives off such Captain Holt vibes
41:00 Vik & josh
this video is up there in my favourites
I swear that the sidemen made 3 videos in 1 place
It really frustrates me when the lads not playing are allowed to help those playing it! They should stay quiet 🤣
The chemistry between JJ and Ethan is elite 😂😂😂
Is everyone gonna ignore that tobi is holding a apple juice 🧃
We can conclude that sidemen react help with trivial knowledge
I swear, I thought the one about Harry's dog was gonna be a Havanese Nuts In Your Mouth joke.
Tobis too confident
the clue was KLM - no way that’s in an airport in japan
25:11 face of pure pain
Amazing energy vid
Should of have gave Ethan some help he never had milk growing up
Yooo Ethan and JJ
#اوقفوا_خطف_اطفالنا
sidemen reacts really do be increasing their knowledge 😂
Even with 2 final questions
The' k' in ksi is actually relevent now
the fact JJ and Ethan won is sooo crazy looool great vid
I wonder if they film, edit, and post all on Sunday or if they do it ahead of time
the chaos of vikk and josh is sending me hahhah
Bro the most watched sport is fotboll ⚽️!!!
I wish i was the Janitor at the show , would have got the chance to clean the drop 😎
This video was class
Nice to see sidemen reacts has actually been teaching them stuff.
23:02

Out of all the sidemen who would have thought JJ and Ethan would win.Fair play to them
I knew the geography one French Guinea smh
Ah bro the stormzy run had me in bits
18:48 what country .... Asia when did Asia become a country
french Guinea? Harry the Guernsey plane crash mate, it's French Guiana. Guinea is a country in Africa, French Guiana is in South America.
JJs been winning at everything, treasure hunt comeback, who want to be a millionaire now this. 🤑
The Funniest Sidemen Video Lately Be Far The Ending Was Hilarious Glad U Guys Kept That In😭😭😭😭
Wombat is in fact a marsupial
Can I join sidemen
Josh and jj saying table tennis shout out to the boy remy brown 😂
is harry wearing Pyjama bottoms ?
Me as a Dutch Table Tennis player :DD
The outro sick
banger
Elite content 😂
Knowing exactly who told Josh about Wombats means I watch too much NP
French Guyana
Big W for the NaijaBoyz🦅
The French border question was an absolute stitch up 😅
Honestly I dislike Josh, his behavior is really weird imo.
gotta love a bit of shape of me yk lmfao
4:46 Shape of me?
I'm here
when harry realized he got scuffed either way in the last question lol
who tf wants pounds. dollars are way better
They should invite fans for one of these games
This was fun to watch
"Does France own Canada" -Josh 2022
27:42 didn't know Toby was German
Mister Knowledge S I has done it, by knowing how many Vs does an animal has... LOL Ethan deserved a win, and he won big...
Who doesn’t know that music question cmon
Josh would no things about ancient history I'm only joking
I can't see properly so what brand is zerkaa wearing
Stacks of paper with a 50 note on each end very clever lads haha
Anyone know what jackey viks got on??
this is hands down the best sidemen video
I’m in love with the shape of me
Harry is a genius
this is the most legendary video im dying its amazing MUST WATCH
Funny how Ethan & JJ could beat ViK & Josh (Nerds)😂😂😂
How tf do use not know what a wombat is  🇦🇺
They spelt Bermondsey wrong
best video yet in 2022
I prefer table tennis
That tenerife air crash was mad 2 plans colliding on the runway
OMG 🤣 KSI is so lucky man every time 😂
Gray haired guy that played with vikstar is stupid and anoying lol get him off the sidemen, he anoying
Ethan and JJ slumdog millionaire through this
They didn’t listen to Vik when he was spitting facts but listen to JJ when he said that a wombat looks like a Pokémon 💀💀
Nice suit Harold!
Amazing finish boys 😂😂
32:23 bruh Wtf 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ngl but I instantly got the French border question
that ending tho 😂😂😂😂😂😂 🔥🔥🔥
When Harry showed Ethan and JJ a Nicado Avocado video he should’ve shown them one of his Onlyfans videos
Sidemen reacts making them smarter now
Sidemen officially back with the bangers
Should definitely do this again
Bruh sidemen reacts unintentionally improve their knowledge xD
Bermondsey spelt incorrectly looool
French Guinea had me LOL
Vik and josh got done dirty with their topics
I know its Tenerife because of breaking bad, haha
Sidemen reacts has finally made KSI’s ‘Knowledge’ grow
omg it’s a harold host? 😎
I literally died when vik and josh lost their money
Somone explain to me how Brazil borders French Guinea when it’s on a completely different continent 😂
24:19
PLZ MAKE ANOTHER SILENT LIBRARY CHALLENGE
Ethan getting question related to milk again 🤣🤣😂
lets go harry as host this gonna be funny af and the last video should have been on more sidemen not a main channel video mo
What an ending 😂
I knew JJ will know the answer to the last question I mean he's JJ he has to know
Thanks!
honestly the best video since sooo long , aaaah i loved it
Bro sidemen videos are more funny because they act like a normal friend group similar to mine . They mock each other all the time they joke about their mothers and stuff . Each like I am hanging out with them or something .
1:00:41 “kangeroo”
Sidemen fast for a day... To all my Muslim friends, Ramadan Mubarak
Did anyone realise that for the milk question 100.5 rounded to the nearest degree is actually 101
The K really came out in KSI today
100.5 degrees would  round up to 101 degrees just saying
The stormzy run🤣
jj looking peng in those glasses
I hope they playing with real money so it’s more entertaining
Harry needs to be the host of all of the game shows they do
Is Nikocado Avacado actually 5'6? I know Google says he is, but he doesn't even look short.
The longest border of france is actually shared with Australia on the pole so they were all wrong🤣🤣
Harry calling it French Guinea instead of French Guiana is hilarious, French Guinea was situated in Africa
Angry Vik is an animal 🔥
Us Aussies know damn well it was cubed not curly
Brazil
Leave the question and the answer on the screen next time...
19:58 Ethan looked so sad 😂
20:40 Ethan: Simon's mum is an animal  Simon: This feels like a payback for; https://youtu.be/tMLnbT1VsZo?t=650
That 'LGBTQ Icons' question at 32:20 was BRAZY LMAOOOOOOOO  I was confused for a sec
Fair play JJ and Ethan
Ethan is on the winning team for a change,  and KSI is defientely a good luck charm in life
36:10 as a malaysian im very dissapointed that hety think that france has a border with us 🤣
every australian watching this when they start talking about wombats
Jj gets smart only at the dirty questions
sidemen real life geoguesser soon pls
That ending was amazing
Me sitting here in Aus, know exactly what a wombat is and Harry saying it’s some sort of bat actually made me lose it 😂😂
KSI - Lamborghini Remix  Ft. Behzinga
funny
Knowledge!
Well , Looks Like JJ Is Going To Make A Lamborghini  Remix  after Buying A Lambo With Ethan
The rich get richer
i love jj glasses
Asking JJ quastion about Pu**ssy 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣 K for Knowledge
Enjoyed 😊💯
3 videos in a day on the same set, damnnn Great work people 👏
does JJ normally wear glasses
Wtf how did Tobi and Josh fail at the geography question. France doesn't border Malaysia or USA,monaco is a microstate,and the only long border they have is Brazil. Bruh moment.
Am I the only Aussie watching…. DO PEOPLE NOT KNOW ABOUT WOMBATS!!😂😂 @sidemen
Ethan has taken some heavy damage
50:05
Jj just cannot loose 😂first the lambo then the million quid with josh and now this hahah mans elite
Josh and Vik got stitched up, give em some $ to compensate for the nonsense that is 'border with france' wtf
21:45 some type of bat       Me as an Aussie:oh dear
Does anyone else find it funny that JJ always end up winning any contest containing money😂🤣
w video
“wait harry, what was that” 😂😂 jj is to funny
I just can't believe JJ and Ethan won the most
Tayble teeennis. Never drown with remy brown😭
Shorter and bigger so he's heavier lololol
Gd vid tbh
Wsi
Tobi spit too much facts bout manu🥲😭😭
Get jidion on sidemen tinder☝🏾🔥
sidemen reacts has improved their knowledge
big up tobi with the tesco exclusive apple juice
The jokes in this vid are actually elite
ayo the subtitle for vikk at 10:34 lmaoooo
Vik is such a legend
the glasses on jj definently brings his Knowledge out more
32:03 look at Tobi's face 😭
Die Harry and kiss everybody else
best video for a long time
Jj and Ethan are actually the smartest sidemen im convinced at this point. Their stupidity is actually just 5head thiught process.
finally back with a banger
This was huge, loved it!!!
I think its safe to say jj is actually learning through sidemen reacts way to go Mr.Knowlegde
Tobi: “he said science or the alphabet” 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Do they actually get the money
That drop 😂😂
Spelling Bermondsey as burmondsey 😂
Looks like sidemen reacts has JJ back on track with his Knowledge aspect in his name.... Still is a fatneek
I love the game show videos
Damn that was a gr8 sidemen sunday
How are they getting these questions wrong lmao
Knowledge SI coming strong
Who would have known JJ and Ethan have the most wrinkles on their brains 😂
harry is always a w host 🤣
Not tax free *
French Guinea hahaha I think he means French Guiana
who else saw alopecia and straight away thought of Jada
Wow
It just hit me that the sidemen never use sponsors/outside brand deals for sidemen sundays
the more u know that Malaysia doesnt have a france boarder 🤣😂
"What is a Wombat?" Me an Australian: 😕
I was shouting out loud that it was Brazil
Eating food while watching sidemen is great, except when the final question is about poo.
The rich get richer
"A, milk"
Imagine being rich enough to throw away £25k “for the boys”
Vik and Josh got done dirty, French Guiana isnt even a country!
Bangerzzzz
The Sidemen bank account got so drained they couldn't afford a discount code lmao
How in gods name, did JJ and Ethan come out with the most money 🤔🤔🤣🤣
kwani, y'all don't know any icons😂😂
Naah 💀 19:54
First 5,400 comments yay!
It’s obviously brazil man 37:00 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Will boutta slap Simon and tobi if they get the question wrong
I love how Harry knew about the 3 vagina thing because he got told on the what’s good podcast
Josh carried this video
So JJ and Ethan are now the smartest sidemen.
I like these kinds of video, but I hate their Mukbang, travel, stupid city challenges, food and 100k vs 100$ vids.
All i kept thinking was "Havenese" balls in ya mouth
Are those stacks of money Real? XD
Bro JJ Is So Full Of Knowledge Man 🤣 He Always Won
💚💜💚💜💚
JJ and Ethan had it so easy compared to the rest
Knew the plane crash one from breaking bad lol
this video was entertaining af!! 😂🔥
Harry being the Best Host In The history of Sidemen!!! He's nailed it Again Lad...!
Is it just me or is JJ maturing ?
@32:06, the look of disbelief from Tobi 🤣
Never drown with Remy Brown
9:45 Simon no respect!!
French Guiana, Harry! Not Guinea!
27:25 vik using his brains like a boss getting all the Indian viewers proud
The last parth was worth waiting
4:53 Shape of me    NOICE
hearing harry say a wombat was a bat and vik saying it was a rodent hurt my soul as an australian
I can relate to 38:29 when KSI starts reacting even he doest know what happened and just act like super pissed when he is clueless…. Used to do that a lot😂😂😂😂
14:50 wtf was that ghost voice that kinda laughed?? seemed out of place
Instant goated video.
Ramadan Kareem 🤲🏻 insha'Allah we all get to jannah 🤲🏻
Love how jj and harry have more subs than the sidemen channel
"Im going to lose everything, or win a little bit more" mmmmmmmmmmmc
No cap but these type of low budget videos are more entertaining than spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on one video these are super entertaining to watch🤣✌️
39:14
the guy who is 160k needs to be put down i swear
made my week fookin insane <3
Sidemen reacts are the real MVP here
KNOWLEDGE FINALLY SHOWED UP
Love jj Ethan duo
This was such a Harry production video, with the jokes, shenanigans and stuffs up haha, gotta love W2S
6:00 The most streamed Spotify tune of all time is shape of me apparently 🤣🤣🤣
Why was vik ignoring Josh's suggestions and acting like a c*nt? Mate have some respect
Some slumdog millionaire vibes here
JJ turned into knowledgjide
Sooo sick
Watching sidemen while eating iftar is the next level of comfy.
and the rich get richer
The reason why wombats poo is squared bc they're poo at the top of borrow and if their was round or curly it might roll down their borrow
Anyone else hear that at 35:45? lol
Every week I wait for sidemen to drop their vid to have 2 perfect meals
9:52
Ethan still the most annoying Sideman 💯💯💯
♥️ॐ♥️
♥️ॐ♥️
I’m actually triggered that Ethan and JJ won and Josh and Vik won nothing lmao
shape of me
Hello there mate
JJ got me doing a standing ovation on that last question, what an icon!
Is it just me or is Miniminter a lowkey b*tch, always saying some sly comment about his mates
Guiana not Guinea.
This video was class!!🤣🤣🤣
I thought thier combined Iq would be lower than my shoe size, but they won. well Congrats boys.
Legends plan.
Ok
No one going to talk about how they don’t know what a wombat is?
I like how sidemen reacts gave them bits and pieces of information that came in clutch, especially with JJ on the final Q when Behz's limelight was stolen.
as a fellow plane crash documentary enjoyer i was malding at the tenerife accident question :DD
As if they spelt kangaroo wrong 😂
♥️ॐ♥️
♥️ॐ♥️
Can we vote kick Vick out the sidemen, he’s progressively gotten more and more annoying for the past 2years
GOAT
Tobi has mean intentions and he can be a  Demon, i wonder how the stans feel about that
Need for speed underground 2 is some unknown game,doubt whoever made the questions knew about it,ofc unless behz said it was his favourite game,see where im going here.        And also come on guys it was obviously Brazil
♥️♥️ॐ♥️♥️
♥️ॐ♥️
Its not french Guinea its French guiana
KSI once again proving the "K" in KSI
Even ik the Brazil one
Dumb and Dumber take the dub😂
18:30 josh reference to my guy remy
Vik and Tobi are the most annoying people on the internet
how did this not get into my homepage
Love how JJ and Ethan improved in trivia questions love the content
I didn't even realize that was Jj talking at 38:05 xD That has to be the first time I heard him talking like that.
Ethan being under lgbtq icon is so funny he doesnt know how to react
JJ actually for once take w from me in trivia
Am I the only one to see 'Shape of me'?
This video was QUALITY
french guiana*
KSI wears glasses, it makes him look smarter It was very effective
Yo wombats are not small
Never ever heard of this show
Is that real money or are my eyes disabled
the ending was busin
Are we gonna talk about how they copied foot asylum?
24:00 I'm trying to eat
hhahahaah what a blunder
harry killing it on the video planning no cap
42:48 jj doesnt want to split we all know why he dont split
KNOWLEDGE!
DIDN'T ASK ::: MINIMINTER 2022
Ksi only wins these
Harry is so adorable.
I love how Harry didnt put any of the european countries (except Monaco) to be nice. And they still messed it up
Their banter is still off the charts 😅💯
love how we all saw the set before the video
This was such a good video hahahaha
Harry wearing trousers and when he is the host then it is the best
most sick vid
I’m
The face of Harry was gold 😂
I thought asia was a continent
Vikks silence was so hilarious😅
This vid was cracka
The USA is not Canada
As an Australian I’m a little bit hurt they didn’t know what a wombat was
I'm still in shock the two sidemen members who act like set 8s managed to pull off a huge win
the hype at end
I love these types of videos
4:48 ''shape if me'' lmaoooo
Thanks
This is my top 10 Sidemen video for sure
The most unexpected duo coming in clutch
Nah this video is a banger 😂😂😂
Harry as the game show host is the best!!!
Y'all ever hear of the new singer 'Shed Eran'? Has a very underrated song called 'Shape of Me'.   I call plagiarism.
57:03 - KSI running like that ‘I’m free’ guy who’s running down the hallway meme 😂😂😂😂
The return of Tommy T
When money is involved, JJ always wins.
seen this 1st in footasylum
Set 8s making a comeback
NGL, Simon and Tobi had the easiest questions up until the Mother question... they should've gotten there with the whole 1Mil...  Also - how did Josh and Vikk not know about a place called French Guiana? It literally has "French" in it... like, they believed there is something french next to Malaysia more than that there could be next to Brazil
Keep up the good work
josh is a goat
bruh how tf boiling point of milk same as water? yall stupid af
sienna mae pissed me off
Finally a banger
Harry casually wears a pair of pajamas with a suit
It's Suriname not Guinea
Don't know why but the question category asked for vikk and zerkaa was unfare bro 😬
Certified banger of a video 🔥
This was a banger
This was so good the best of 2022 so far
Simon chiefed Ethan with that "didn't ask" 😂😂😂
28:12 Is Tobi okay?
JJ With glasses TOTAL nerd 🥸
yall need to drop that vest zerkaa is wearing
Wthan Wsi
Lol. 800kms, it’s massive. Fam. That’s a days drive to a holiday in Australia lmao
They should totally do a family feud asking side+ the questions
this is so entertaing i watched it the whole
Nah Vik and Josh got stiffed
Harry’s gameshows are the top howlers, gotta love it.
Everyone knows a quark is the noise a posh duck makes.
Quark is a little like curd cheese and relativly common in germany or even some more countries. I eat quark daily and at breakfast. So the answer might not be that wrong..
how do these guys not know anything about politics in 2022? kinda sad tbh, they could influence a change with the fanbase they have.
the fact that those two knew both of the questions meant to make them lose 🤣
an excellent sidemen video yet again beautifully executed well-done chaps 👌👍👌👍
Wombats are cute meatballs with legs
Ksi is so stylish now
Best sdmn sunday in a while
58:02 ah yes, 100.5 rounds to 100 instead of 101 well done harry
Vik laughing and undermining ksi and Ethan the whole time after losing everything only for them to win the most was perfect
Tobi: Who we waving 😂

The first question tho😂😂 Atleast they r not afraid of getting in the slap scandal and roasting it openly
25:13 😂

Vic seriously has to stop acknowledging everyone calling him so smart. Not even the smartest member of the Sidemen.
Basketball is very popular in Asian countries as well
I was shouting Brazil ffs!
"And it was really foggy" with the campest hand gesture he could make 😂😂
Absolutely deserved JJ and Behz!

So much fun 🤘👍
It’s always the “dumbest” sidemen that win the most 😂😂 Ethan and JJ are a great team 🤪

How could an animal have cubed poo
I love this type of sidemen sundays, brings the whole group together
The LGBTQ question💀
I love these types of vids
I laughed a bit to much when tobi did this 28:12
As a Aussie I was fuming when they all said “what’s a wombat”
At 21:43 as a former Australian i feel very offended that they don’t know what that animals is 😂
Ethan solo carried JJ
I live in tenerife and homestly i hay no clue about the plane crash
Unfair vik and Josh questions were really hard compared to the rest
Becoming boring now
WillSmith is about to go to UK
Who would of expected jj and Ethan to do the best 😂
These game show videos are elite👏
That was pretty wholesome😂😂😂
Vikk used 50 percent of his brain power
what a video <3
wasn't expecting the winner of this video. but the underrated ones, win most of the money. congrats to JJ and Ethan
Ethan, Most Wanted is better 😎
I swear I couldn’t get through a day without watching one of the sidemen
I died when harry is like a wombat is a type of bat
Man jj and ethan always smashes it😂😂😂 seeing them know and confidently answer is so dopeeee everytimeee 😂
Ethan has come so far from A: Milk
Wii FAT AHAHHAHA
About to board a flight and these guys talking about plane crashes   FFS

Ethan and JJ absolute GOATS😂🔥🔥
JJ: Remembers lyrics from a school project 10+ years ago. Also JJ:  Forgets lyrics to his BRIT nominated song 'Lighter' hahaha ❤
The ' K ' in ksi is literally stands for knowledge bro he is just pretending to be a fool guy
There is no French Guinea next to Brazil right? Josh and Vik just got robbed
JJ and Behz make the best team no cap😂
Vik was only loading cod because josh kept unloading nfs underground onto gta🤦‍♂️
32:44
Vik and Josh took a Massive L
This is what we are here for
Sakdainani feri
When in doubt, trust in Vikk
Question about milk appears: Ethan:😰
Harry really didn't want another "Who wants to be a Millionaire" ending
How the turn have tables…jj and behz big brains
32:55 Vikk trying to play it down while Josh just drops the bomb on them 😂😂
The money looks like Harry's pant pattern
I was absolute spamming Tenerife in my Mind for the plane crash question
Vik really said table tennis was a right-off for most popular sport lol. its the national sport of China
Yeah,Shape of me
What did Tobi say in the initial moments?
a sidemen sunday without randy is a good sidemen sunday
harry is the best game show host.
As usual a dub video.   Sidemen putting the work
Golf was a write off straight off the bat😂 dafuq were they even saying
Toby with apple juice in his hand is just amazing
20:48... Bouta witness an reenactment of Will Smith on Oscar night
JJ carrying the sidemen on YouTube & Ethan on Million pounds drop.
The fact is That two of the dumbest sidemen won the contest😂😂

:)) who just lked my comment ?
WOW lol sdmn vids are always a banger!!
U lot should start to mc again man
I found this so funny omg the screaming at the end 😂😂😂
The answer to that french border question is not French Guinea, it's French Guiana. French Guinea is in Africa, French Guiana is next to Brazil.
Harry: Ask the Animals question..  JJ: wait wait wait wait, i know this Hahahahaha, i know thissssss !! Sidemen reacts !!! HAHAHA DROP EM !!
8:50 had me rolling
As an Australian kangEroo triggered me ngl
Vik should have won
Do they actually get to keep the money tho?
JJ always finesse in these money related videos
French Guinea gained independence from France on 2 October 1958... Its not a French border bro haha😂
Fellow Malaysians must have been hyped hearing the country as one of the answers.
Who would have even thought
20:41 31:20 43:16 48:04
First question already got me dying😂
Stealing footasylum’s whole flow
Harry changed the question because they know the answer..but they still know the Answer to the other questionHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH
Niko avacado needs to play rugby as prop
56:26 Tobi's old lady laugh 😆😆
shape of me is the best song ever by ed sheeran
58:44
Justice for behzinga and ksi
Is anybody surprised that JJ knows a Kangaroo has three vaginas lol??
banger
Cant believe they filmed this video, the two others on MoreSidemen (slap game & water game) all in one day. Work rate is mad
Actually a top tier video
During the music one I love how they were like "Don't look at jj!" I never thought there would be a day when ppl would rely on him for a answer in a quiz
The outro song sounds better in 1.25 x speed
Wow!! Ethan & JJ surprised everyone!! Glad they won!!
Harry is wrong, French Guinea is in Africa. What he meant was French Guiana which is still the largest border out of the four options.
Credit to footasylum
bro simons face at 19:05 😆
Did they do a discount code this sunday i didnt hear idk if i missed it or not
1:00:07 Shoutout to Simon's What's Good podcast for this gem of a question
"cancel the question"
the most wholesome team won
On of the best vids ❤😂
Props JJ and Ethan ROLLED THE OTHER TEAMS
10:55 Harry in Sidemen Tinder: 'I watch Plane crash documentaries', so yeah not a surprise
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 broo ksi had me dead “wait i know this”🤣🤣
what about Louisiana? It's the largest one with the USA.
All Sidemen game show videos are goated.🐐
The lowesr IQ team in that whole group won the most amount of cash, lol.
I love how JJ wins most of these team games lol
The Canary Islands Fuerteventura. The plane 💥 crash
Jokes aside, JJ and Ethan are really good at general knowledge and trivia
Can we acknowledge big brain KSI, on the winning team on who wants to be a millionaire and on the winning team now
1:01:25 Tobi:"who are we waving?"  hilarious
This was the funniest in a while lol
harry saying a wombat is some sort of bat had me dying 😂
Question is… will JJ Split or steal the money
all Australians after they say wombats a bat...😐😐😐
This man can't lose 😂
Trust jj to know the answer to the last question
U know when Harry is stupid when he rounds 100.5 degrees Celsius to 100 as the nearest degrees celsius
well done guys, yous managed pissed off will smith 3 minutes through the video 🎉
Now where can i find SIDEMEN SHREDS 🤔🤔🤔🤔
39:10 has got to be the best thing in the whole video, the expression on vik and Josh’s face, the reaction from the boys on the bench is just too good, whole video was a banger tho ngl ☠️
The way Harry starts to scurry away yelling “Cancel the question!” Made my day
Ethan’s stormzy run 😂😂😂😂
Ethan: "I don't think he hit it first" Vik: "I didn't, I'm not Ray J" 49:02 😂
HARRY IS THE GOAT 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Harry was wearing the same suit in calfreezy's new vid, how come jj wasnt with them🤔
vik and josh got funest this wasnt fair at all
Can't say there questions were easier when they all had the same questions, it's all on the matter of which category they chose. Fair play to all them lot they put up a show.
Great video lads 👍😃
isn't boiling point of milk is 95 degree celcius
1080p... what happened
As an Australian The way they couldn’t describe a wombat triggered tf outta me
It's jokes because all that money is probably JJs and Viks 😄
38:05 *JJ "Wait, Harry.. what was that"* he turned into an alien from M.I.B
Harry 🐐
my fellow Aussies cringing when they thought a wombat was a bat or a rodent
That Brazil question with vik and josh, I learnt about that yesterday so it was mad funny seeing that drop, aii😭😅❤️
wow they filmed three videos in one day nice
39:10 just gonna leave this here 😂
8:08 19:56 20:41 21:51 22:28 32:29 32:55 39:09 39:20 39:53
Finally a great great video top 3 of the year
after knowing the editing magic of these game shows i can’t unsee the black wall above them that they turned into a screen
Falling off??
This was one of the best sidemen Sundays in a while
Josh: We aint Fit before  also Josh: We Fat Bro ..  caught me off guard 🤣
the moment jj and ethan won i said out loud fu*k u harry😂🤣
Josh is the dumbest
harry was so mad!
Suriname, not French Guinea ahahahah
Bruh and Josh, "Nah were a Wii fat bro" 😂😂 Kings all around, love the sidemen lmfao
I had to actively search for this video. Didn’t show up in recommended and didn’t get a notification even though I’m subscribed.
“Why are we waving” “it’s nice” 😂
Tody claimed he is religious man while not worshiping the God of Jesus
Sidemen TRAPPED NEEDED
Shoutout to SidemenReacts for acknowledging the Sidemen lol
The quark question had two correct answers… they are charged particles that when combined create protons and neutrons
these guys just asked what a wombat was
JJ and Tobi are almost matching!
That Wii joke killed me 🤣
i feel like this is scripted 🤔
Minus 100K for spelling Kangaroo wrong 😂
36:14 im actually gassed that Malaysia made it into a Sidemen video 🤩🤩
Shape of me?
lets all admit  we didnt expect the winner
love it outta ethan and jj
It hurt as an Australian to hear them describe a wombat.
Shape of me
Genuinely entertaining ending. Also, Harry looked constipated at the end there.
Enter a wii fat into a josh being a savage compilation
So I looked up the boiling point of milk… it’s 112 Fahrenheit. Not 100.5
"A Wombat is a pokimon" 🤣🤣 Come to Australia try catch the "pokimon" curious who would win JJ or wombat 🤣🤣🤣🤣 they can be masssivee
Too many questions honestly. Should’ve been shortened so they could keep more. Maybe like 3 less questions
That geography question was so easy... can't believe josh and vik got it wrong, insane
That ending was phenomenal LMFAOOO
"cancer of the head"  harold the best host w minimal effort.
When harry said that a wombat is some sort of bat, bro my Aussie heart stated to crumble haha
Tobi trying to get a sponsorship by the apple juice company. Label facing out and everything.
another video showing the rich gets richer
Everyone sees a team with jj on it is the underdog. He's been clutch
only ogs get the joke @ 32:38
19:50 one of my favourite bit of the episode
Discount code?
Absolute jokes😂
A quark is from a anime
The pain watching them avoid Brazil when I knew it was the correct answer instantly.
32:55 is a SDMN shorts right there.
The moment when ethan goes like it's my video, and then jj goes like I know this sidemen reacts! Those were THE moments of 2022 Sidemen
That French Border question is understandably confusing. The other Sidemen acting like its not is pretty disingenuous, especially considering that Harry acted like the answer was obvious because of French Guinea, which isn't even a real country and was only a former French territory in Africa, when he almost certainly meant French Guiana. If even he messed up or was confused about the reasoning, its pretty safe to say that Josh and Vikk were reasonably confused. He should've just said whether it meant 'bordering a French speaking country' or 'bordering a land controlled by France.'
Why is Simon such an instigator😂
All Australian’s when they said a wombat was a rodent😡😡😡😡
That "HOW IS HE STILL ALIVE" was gold
a classic sidemen video after a while !!!
42:55
that French question was bs and hurts me as a Canadian cause Canada counts a a French speaking country therefore a French country and its border with the us is about 10 times that of Brazil, French guinia border
harry tried to slip Malaysia in
I’m sure google is currently wondering why so many people are searching up and suddenly interested in Kangaroos having 3 vagina’s
LGBTQ Icons: What is Ethan…  💀🤣💀🤣💀 I can’ttttttt
Lmao French Guinea (French Guiana)
I truly think that Harry is the best gameshow host ever
1:00:41 how did they misspell kangaroo
Absolute banger
1:00:41 - they spelt kangaroo wrong lmao 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😂😂
It’s French Guiana lol, not French Guinea. That was in Africa, and doesn’t exist anymore.
Tbf they deserved it
as an aussie them not knowing what a wombat is hurt. ive never heard of anyone saying a wombat is a type of  bat
46:03  bez be like...oh shut up lads.. we saw u play
Gg
The geography question was so easy that was poor
i am an aussie and i hate when people dont know what the native australian animals are.
JJ has won a Million and now this… JJ has bread 😂
wombats = small bats hahahshaah
The 2 biggest knuckle heads in the group were the best to play lmao
38:05 JJ has the most English accent I’ve ever seen HAHAHAHA
15:00 their reactions hahahaha I can´t
This sidemen sunday video was honestly gold n i swear to god, the average players simon n tobi get only 1 stack of cash, the smartest sidemen dont even work together n arrogantly go all in n fumble it sooo bad, the team everyone thought would lose actually work as a team n end on such an amazing win knowing the answer to BOTH questions AND to top it all off harry is the host, this is by far one of the best sidemen sundays in my opinion… no question, im sooooo happy for ethan and jj they defo deserved that dub, 100% deserve a like n uno what imma save this vid to my playlists jus so i can come back to rewatch it n not forget how much of a banger this was!!!! Love the sidemen keep it up!!!!!👍🏽
bruh those questions got mad later on :D
vik and josh been done dirty
22:00 Tommy T streams coming in clutch
how did it take them so long to know what shape a wombats poo is
I think discriminating against the smart team really tips off the balance of the game as it's still possible for them to answer Hard questions but it's way easier for other teams to answer easy questions. 👍
Love Ethan and JJ as a duo..
The Stormzy run is sending me 😂😂😂🤣🤣
Banger video
They just said a wombat is a type of bat
25:19 Tobi saying it’s science or the alphabet😭😭😭😭
Dumbbos wins every time
Is someone gonna tell Harry it's French *Guyana*?
French Guinea is/was in Africa
I’m from the Canary Islands 🇮🇨 I’ve never heard of those 2 planes crashing into each other
Tobi isn't funny
Another Certified Banger! 🔥🔥🔥
Fcuk those tinder ones. We need more of these with lord W2S as host.
“Tayble tennis” Never drown remy brown🙏🏼
So crazy seeing Ethan and JJ finally win together 🤣, everyone else is like God damnit, talk about true pain
Wombat poo is less interesting than they make it to seem. It’s like big dog biscuits
I love how JJ has money but loves to rob the Sidemen trust fund
Even though they said it was randomised i feel like they did Josh and vik dirty
BIG film day for these lads
Shape Of Me????? 4:45
Dynamic duo Ethan and JJ
Yes ladsss
i died at the mothers question and lgbtq icons
the guyy with the most money wins the most money en is very happy:)
I lowkey love how Harry knows all about plane crashes and the Tenerife disaster cause I’m into that stuff too 😂
Meanwhile me in Malaysia: 👁 👄 👁
Shape of me 😂
wait, why is it not in 4k?
"What country popularizes that sport? Asia."
JJ and Ethan winning is the best glow up of knowledge I’ve ever seen, change KSI to “Knowledge Smartness and Intelligence”
6:02 its written shape of me
2mill views in 10 hours let that sink in
No sidemen code?
Actually like these show vids are great! Big up Harry for the questions and hosting 👏👏👏
This was such a good video
19:00 shout out to my man Remi.  Taaaaaable tennis!!!! So glad josh and jj quoted it!!
Has Behz been wearing a durag?
Why is Vik suddenly being an actual representation of "source: trust me, bro"... He literally goes "It's definitely this one… I think… If not, then I'm stupid… "😂
Jj and ethan's coordination graph📈📈
JJ and Ethan
Just happy all 7 seven sidemen are back and smashing it!
imagine if quark meant a dog farting & queefing at the same time that would’ve been the best sidemen moment of all time
Shape of me ????
please do another episode of this i loved it
How does kJ always win money 💰
throwbi strikes again
Great vid
16:15 LMAO
But does French Guinea still exist today? Since the question asks "has the longest French border", i.e. Present tense?
Isn't it french Guiana??
14:47
I didn't think I'd be googling wombat poop at 7 am in the morning, but here we are😅
32:28 😂
i love how much they think theyre great with the education they never used becaue theyve done youtube, ethan basically got to where they are, while doing what he wanted, these man were stressing about school🤣
It's like Don't Drop the Money TV show!
Ksi went knowledge, smart and intelligent at this one
Josh like "Wii fat"😂😂
At 4:55 the option is shape of me  Sad ed sheeran noisea
Behz has taste in games must say
Good to see the sidemen take this show idea
Y’all should try to link with Demi Rose for a video
JJS ENERGY IS JUST HILARIOUS
banging video
after this video, i'm traumatized with planes now
Crazy how the "dumb" ones of the group won the most but big up the boys
Literally just skipped to JJ and Ethan part the rest are soo boring to watch especially vik and josh
JJ olatunji olajide looking like a fresh snacc
Wombats are Australian
What did they mean when they said "BTS"?
OBVIOUSLY the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA has the largest border with a french colony lofllllll
Harry is a bog for cancelling the question for ethan and jj lool
why they chose plane crashes over politics I will never understand
“Nah it’s wii fat bro” I just choked on my drink and slurpee came out my nose LMAO
the way vik and josh lost all their money
The first and only time JJs pervy knowledge about vaginas have come in handy ahahaha
Blinding lights is the most streamed Spotify song
Being shorter does normally mean u weigh less
Sidemen version of footasylum "secure the bag"! Its an ok
why does Simon pretend to be dumb to be funny. bros like 30 and went private school
JJ's knowledge has improved
Simon and Ethan need to do distracks on each other
Tbh vik and Josh had harder questions poor lads 😂😂
Ksi actually said smt smart at 14:30
51:22
“Quantum physics or the alphabet” -Tobi 25:18 had my dying 💀
lets goo sidemen
Gas video
Sidemen should start doing prem reactions. To the biggest games.
what happened to the collab they were gonna do in the U.S?
Vik is hilarious 30:06
Josh really just asked if France owned Canada, WHEN THE UK Owned canada?????????
2:22 3:33 33:03
11/10 video this brightened my day love u guys
Fuckin hell simon did harry snort your hair line ffs
Fun fact : Its not French Guinea, its French Guyana that has the biggest French border. (just saying bog)
When did ed Sheeran made a song with I'm in the love with the shape of 'me'.
BIG BRAIN KSI AND ETHAN. I have  noooooo doubt they would have won
Tobi drop an apple juice brother would fly off the shelf
French Guiana btw
All the original ideas taken huh thank fucc adblock exists
Is the sound muted? Or is it my phone problem?
Love the sidemen gameshows
harry has fs been wearing the same trousers in the last 3 videos
banger
At this point, idk what I will watch on YT that isn't sidemen or sidemen individual channels. Love this before even watching finish
*how can they afford this?..….. Side+*
Anyone see shape of me😂
I think Folabi would make a better host for this ting.
No offence but they are idiots
When it comes to money… Harry and JJ is unstoppable
JJ and ETHAN has improved in trivia a lot.
i like how the first answer for vik and josh is about quantum phyisics and straight off of google 🤣😂
Winners win, losers sore
“What a disaster” -Vikk 😂😂😂
This is a whole movie
Why would u think there would be a  Terrorist attack in Japan like cmon
Harry as host is always a BANGER
32:55 Josh That Was A Violation
Its not wii fit bro its we fat 🔥🔥🔥🔥
As an Australian, I'm hurt they don't know what a wombat is. :(
harry's ding dong look big
When money is involved viks confidence is skyhigh lmaoooo
20:40 jesus😂
Just wanna put this out there, not the best camera setup this time kon lighting could have been better and more professional
As an Australian no one properly knowing what a wombat is was wierd to me
Love how halfway through everyone just started helping tobi and Simon 😂
19:52 LMAO
W vid
Boiling point of milk is around 200F
Shape of Me lmaoo
#againstallodds
firee
Tobi craddling that box of apple juice is the most tobi thing ive seen
Never drown with remy brown
What is a wombat? A type of bat  Australia: ????
tobi at 25:17 didn’t expect him to say that
FINALLY JUST THE SIDEMEN ONLY
I'm used to no jj in videos  and I feel it's better without him
Havanese and shitzu are way to similar wtf was the question for josh and vik
Banger lads
Jj and Ethan goated team
The chaos during.. Josh and Vik.... Entertainment. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is what happened when no teamwork between vik & josh. Vik is just too excited & lost.
When the icons question came up and it was about Ethan then zerkaa said “Wii Fat” it officially broke me 😂🤣
Another banger video loved it💪
Actually I just knew that wills wife had alopecia like 17 days ago I wish I could've helped them
Y am I not surprised that jj knew the answer to the last question?
I don’t know what the funniest conversation in this video was I was dying every round they had to think about it
The team that we all thought will do the worst actually did the best
57:55 i looked up on internet boiling point of milk said 200 so either im wrong or the m peoples got strong fire
32:45😂
"It's a marsupial." 🤓
please do more videos with chunkz, filly and Harry
As a plane geek, Simon and Tobi disappointed me
Best. Ending. Possible.
The rich get richer
harry got milk wrong its 95 degrees as milk boils faster due to a thinner and more fat in the liquid.
Ethan's dance is amazing
Wish I could be a youtuber
The USA border with Quebec is like 100km longer than the French Guiana-Brazil border, so if the question was about places where french is spoken, Josh would have been right!
Where the discount code 👀 🤔
JJ Saying table tennis over and over has me crying😂😂
Disclaimer: Those weren't Harry's questions.
Lowkay funniest ending to a sidemen vid
Hopefully no alcohol this time round😂
As an Australian, hearing them describe what they think wombats are is painful
Also known as the “Sidemen average american weight drop”
French Guyana😂
Bro really got me searching up wombat poo
Big brain: Sidemen created sidemen reacts to educate themselves
Idk y but i felt proud when they asked vik is it less chance or more chance 😂
According to Josh 🤦🏽‍♂️😂 Canada is owned by France
Wii fat was so jokes 😂
I thought tenerife because japan is to well organized to have to planes crash on the run way.
20:40 Damn the look Simon gave Ethan actually scared me a little 😂
Wii Fat... That's bants 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Banger
That ending was phenomenal
I love how it ended in the most sidemen way possible. Ethan and JJ deserved it they were solid!!
🔥 vid
FINALLY!!!
Commenting this with video only at 10 seconds and it’s going to be a banger with harry as host
can we all just appreciate the fact that Tobi has worn those exact same clothes the last 3 MoreSidemen videos and now this.
Harry finally got to use the Kangaroo question from the What’s Good Podcast
BEST ENDING EVER
🔥🔥
That is indeed urus😂
The ending was sooo funny🤣🤣 Harry really tried it🤣🤣
32:00 to 33:10 was absolutely perfect lmao
Putting digits for an amount in title would surely do better than words.
JJ in glasses is a different beast
Why’s no one talking about 49:05 when vik said “I’m not ray j” 😂😂
That was an unexpected team to win the most 😮
JJ in glasses!! 😍🔥
wish they just got rid of josh
josh is so damn annoying
A live audience will do loads for this
Whoever answered that question with getting spooned on the mothers then your mad for answering I'm a Side+ member but I'm glad I never answered that question
Yessir! It’s SidemenSunday :)
Can we just talk about the fact that JJ knows what somalia has 3 vaginas
good video
For Tobi and Simons questions were super easy In my opinion, especially the wombat one, probably cuz I'm australian but Idk. When Harry said it's a type of bat I died
Ksi really can’t lose
“And If we lose I’m used to it I’m a United fan” everyone proceeds to clap for poor Tobi😂😂 great video!
I needed this
Great vid !
Hope when sidemen come Australia they see a wombat and see how big these guys get 😂
20:38 best part of the video. Lmao. 🤣🤣💀💀
This is such a sick video . Why is is not getting the views
elite
Why is there no more sidemen discount code
finally an hour-long banger
since when is harry not a chelsea fan…
wombat = bat  wow so literal lmao
The rich person of the group made the most money out of the group, how ironic 😂
Harry is god host 😂 to the rigged questions on vikk and josh to the plot twist of lgbtq category. Legend.
Harry is the best host out of all sidemen
Bro vikk has the biggest bullocks to without discussion go all in in havanese
footasylum?
Yo this was fun!! Good job, Harry!
That outro is fire Jesus props To the editors
Jheeeeeez. Big ending 😂😂
always jjs team with the last question clutch when harry is the host
genuinely felt so happy for Ethan and JJ... they really took the hard way and won..deserved
The fact that jj knew how many Vag’s a kangaroo has is hilarious
Bruh I thought Ethan and JJ were gunna get stuffed 😂 turns out they literally couldn’t get the last question wrong 🤣
Says shape of me smh
this was one of the best episodes i've ever watched and the cemetery between jj and ethan really did win it alll 😁😁😎😎
Don’t no me I’m Tommy T
Also the crew laughing in the background
Wii Fat bruh I'm dead☠
MY GUY HARRY I LOVE MAYDAY AIR CRASH INVESTIGATIONS TOO!
My life is a crash somewhat !
Table tennis Haha and the fun fact by Behz leading to Simon mom called a animal
Yo jj an Ethan killed it especially at the end 😂😂😂 o hey I know this on both of em 🤣
They should have done split or steal to decide who got the remaining money from each team
18:40 I just looked this up, and little every single site and chart I’ve come across says football is the most popular by far!! The most popular one out of these it table tennis, although in most it’s the number 6 most popular
JJs “I know this” was the funniest part 😂😂
kangeroo
=}
Josh always does his best to lose winning money
32:53 Tommy T taking over Josh's body once again with that violation.
The buffoonery in this video is just… wild
Harry goated as a host
32:50 💀💀
What happened to Ethan's face
The sideman can do the fasting challenge as it's the fasting month for the Muslim. just saying 😅
I thought it was Hilarious that JJ and Ethan both knew one of their final questions forget the tension lol that was great who’s dumb now!!!!!!
She doesn’t actually have Alopecia
W
I didn’t know the answer to the air craft question and I’m an aviation engineer lol
2 good classic vids on moresidemen and this video 🤔 I guess they’re not dusted up yet
i’m so confused, do they actually get the money?
"Shape of me"
jj watching rupauls drag race is so iconic
56:58 STORMZY
Im from Malaysia and boy vik and josh are so wrong..we are in asia bruh..
Harry is easily the best game show spermologist and host I’ve ever seen!
Harry is an elite.
JJ just attracts money bruv 😂
4:54 shape of me😂
behz seems to have gotten a lil plump
Vik and josh blundering that Brazil answer was pure shocking 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
What’s the intro music name
Harry tried it lol
Bifocal JJ might give Fulabi a run for his money lmao
The Production Tho 🥶
Banger video  for real I miss this game show 😂
Wombat is Australian they are not bats
Ethan and JJ actually put in an unreal performance, fair play to them, they smashed everyone else
Damn bro, Ethan and ksi is all jokes, they had me cracking up so much, underrated pairing
that French border ques had me
Richa gets richer
Man, Knowledge showed up in this video.
20:41 😂😂
@3300
Anyone gonna talk about French Guinea being in Africa not near Brazil?
Ksi wins so many sidemen game shows 😂😂
"Tableeee Tennis,!", Never drown with remy brown!
my man vikk had me go "damnn" with all that confidence on the havenese qst!! bigg upp whamstar
Do they actually get the money
32:00 shots fired at behz 32:54
Jj is on that smart ting
The team with josh and vik I thought it was going to be the dream team 🥲
Can we acknowledge jj’s laugh when he said I know this and moved the money 😭😭😭 1:00:20
Video of the year vik/Ethan/ksi are funny asf
Josh knowing the shape of a Wombats poo because someone told him in GTA rp 😂
The Sidemen have been dropping heat lately. Keep it up, boys.
Malaysia is nowhere near french
44:00
Never drown with Remy Brown
Bruh 25:05 😂😂😂😂
Saw that lgbtq joke a mile off
28:26 best shot of the video
Talk about trying to change the view of Ethan and JJ being dumb by giving them the easiest questions to make them look smarter lol
As soon as Harry said 1977 I knew it was Tenerife
Ayy
Hearing these boys try figure out what a wombat is hurt my brain
43:59  TOBI just chilling with his apple juice
French Guyana btw
40:00
French Guiana, not Guinea
1:00:20 - 1:00:30 - 1:00:40 The best Sidemen scene ever Ethan "Drop em g, Drop It, Drop the ting" KSI " Drop the ting,Drop the ting " I would off kill myself crying if the money fell down😂😂😂😂
as a dumb American i know french Candnda is Qubec which doesn't touch us it sit top of Ontario, but then I look at the map and I am mostly worng. part on qubec is doesn't touch the USA but it dose touch for state Maine Vermont New Hanshpire and part of New York. so if he counting Qubec it acuttay good side broader.
That ending lmao 😂
The time has come where Vikk has better drip then JJ
These videos are always the best when Harry is the host
why is the questions easier for the dummer ones?
just saying french guinea (Africa) what harry was pronouncing is a very different place to french guiana (pronounced like gee ah nuh). I was very confused when harry said it bordered to brazil haha
Vik star is prime example of financial abuse
i love how simon doesnt know how annoying he is
What sidemen react video did JJ know the answer to the kangaroo from?
ofc, zerka has a problem with vik answering the questions. Zerka the guy with a opinion and but no facts to back it up with.
Random question, where in the Uk can I find a female kangaroo ?
Wombats shape their poo in cubes
i am liking this vid just because ethan and jj won a trivia video 😂😂
They had been playing each for a 1.3 million dollars
ethan and jj were quality
If only Simon was a breaking bad fan, he would know the 747 crash happened in tenerife
How is it dat almost every video the smartest teams lose and the dumber ones win 😂😂😂
10:02 totally support Tobi with that :(
love when harry hosts.. he says plane crashes like its a cheerful topic lmao
How the tables have been turned. JJ and Ethan now is winning it all in intelligent content videos
Videos are always the best when Harry is the leader of the games
39:18 French Guinea was in West Africa (Now just called Guinea) whereas French Guiana borders Brazil.  Still doesn't change the answer, but something to note.
I really like their new content it’s super good but I also miss the old banter stuff the sidemen used to do when they weren’t as popular.
27:39 nah Tobi is doing a mad thing. 😳
sidemen react pays 😂
56:38  JJ rapping about the Haber process is something I never thought I'd see ever. If only it was taught to us this way, my marks would have been way better
what  an ending. absolutely beautiful  ending
54:14
A wombat is also known as a drop bear
JJ really out here with the KNOWLEDGE on this one
when watchign sidemen reacts is actually  needed and is the most underrated sidemen channel
Harry is a good game show host Mans is the most awkward and funny person ever 🔥
8:47
I LOVE the game show sidemen Sunday’s so much!!
When the plot twist has a plot twist 🤣😭😭😭
Never drown with remy brown
harry as the host is always jokes 😭😭 the way he dresses, the questions, and his obsession with plane crashes LMFAO
27:57 vikkstar being a real one to the bois
The fact French Guinea isnt even a place anymore was even funnier
Harry's question/answer absolutely makes 0 sense
as a history and geography major, i don’t think i’ve screamed more than when the brazil question came up
56:15 that’s the first time anyone has ever said that sentence
The sidemen: a wombat is a little rodent.  Me an Australian: no. No they are not.
Haven't been to happy with some of the vids recently but this is what I look for
Sidemen Apology Calorie Challenge
Out of all of the teams, JJ and Ethan were the ones I thought would win the least or lose, and Vik and Josh to win the most... interesting how the world works huh
Goateed video
how does jj always win these lmao
25:17 *"It's says science or the alphabet"* XD
Harry always pulling through with bangers !!😭
Jj and Ethan killed it hahahaahahaaa the boys are fuming
48:06 🤣🤣 well then...
do just want to point out french guiana is not french guinea for the french border question.
20:36 36:55
Everyone doubt jj and ethan
GOD BLESS
Harry has done that to Ethan
That K on KSI use well in this video
this should be uploaded on the W2S channel XD
Vik and Josh got stiffed
All of Australia crying at Harry calling a wombat a bat, and the vik calling them a rodent 😅 them things write off cars and walk away
It’s a good day when the Sidemen upload.
🔥
I don’t normally comment… but I gotta say… hell of a video man 🔥🔥 JJ and Benz combo 🐐goated
Best one yet
Never drown with Remi Brown - table tennissss
didn't expect JJ and Ethan would win lol
This was amazing!!
45:02 *mental note*
Seidman have become so boring compare to beta squad
When they said a Wombat is a type of bat i lost it....
Vikk is to smart fam! hahaha
keep it up lads
Still waiting for sidemen catchphrase   Idk I just feel it’d be good
The ending was so satisfying and wholesome
better than satellite TV !!!
I just love the face simon makes when JJ beats him 😂
Is no one gonna talk about the LGBTQ question
Not knowing about French Guyana as a brit is pitiful, the americans of europe
Sidemen gameshows are elite , definitely my favourite.
Josh is a dumb old man, Vikks back must hurt from that carry job
Gotta love the game shows
the “tayyyble tennis” bit had me crying 😭 josh and jj are a funny and underrated duo
Harry was made to host game shows
Josh had an absolute howler in this video. Couldn't of been better winners haha.
We NEED more harry game shows 😂😂
Watched an entire 1hr vid to see the two most "dumb sidemen" win more than everyone. BARE JOKE😭💀
It’s actually French Guiana and I’m from Guyana and didn’t knoe
Cancel the question they know the answer 😂😂😂 only in the Sidemen the real show would never
Play poker
Harry was pissed that they both knew the last 2 questions 😂😂😂
Do they actually keep this money?
Wii fat😂😂😂😂😂
When Harry said a wombat is a type of bat that absolutely triggered both me and the whole of Australia
Harry out here inventing territories I love that Guyana became Guinea
Harry fr pairs a buttondown with blazer and tie with pajamas lmaooo
Mr.Knowledge with the clutch
most streamed song is Rockstar
I would like to know if they actually give the money to the winners?? I'm assuming it's just for the video and they just put the money back in their bank accounts. Haha
Semi skimmed milk is 98% water
4:48 "shape of me" lmao
💯❤️😂
harry should take charge og game show from now on. Questions are Jokes LMAO
This video was great man 😂 bez and jj the goats❤
38:28  "wajajaputuputadoin" - Tobi
This man said "French Guinea" lmfaoooo
Leave it to JJ and ethan to win the most money on sidemen sunday
This is low key sidemen roasting each other
JJ needs to drop 1 million pounds
Do People out side of Australia really not know what a wombat is
Ethan and ksi knowing the answers to the last ones and winning the most is the best thing about this video
8:55 “We like Sportz and we don’t care who knows” ayy! Big up Josh & Tobi. Big up Lonely Island lmao
Did anyone realise Bermondsey is spelt different on the show or is just me...   Maybe they should introduce a Sidemen spelling test or bring it back !!
I was a bit annoyed at first when they were not paired equally. Seeing jj and ethan win this brings a great smile
amazing content boys love it!!
Omg the ending
tobys face XD 32:02
What does getting spooning mean?
1:00:18 Everyone’s face during this moment 😂
Damn Jj and Ethan just looted the Sidemen bank account. The other guys were probably crying inside😂😂
Who knew the Tenerife answer from Walter White?
Everyone: "Choose lgbtq+ icons" Harry: "what is ethan behzinga paynes favorite video game:  Everyone liked that
1:00:41 Kangeroo?
The sidemen are the perfect guys to watch while eating
Toby in the end “who are we waving” 😂😂😂 1:01:26
it's a banger lads
Ancient history: where in London was Josh Zerkaa born?😂😂😂 daymn
JJ is smart after all Omg
Am I the only one here that thought Ethan and JJ’s round was going to be a complete joke
One million pounds is quite heavy for a drop
It's my birthday today and I'm watching sidemen sunday at 6 a.m. in the morning in India
Josh moved 300 bags onto GTA from racing then blamed vikk just because he moved them onto WaW to save the cash from an obviously wrong decision.
24:33 segregation, even in their clothes
Behz’s voice is slowly morphing into Claude from AFTV 😂
guys this video is great another great video but along side with the questions maybe a small video regarding to the question( like in the fat guy video) like the question about jj crossbar.
And the rich get...
Man I hate that simon is such a sweat
K-kangaroo,S-science and I-intelligence=KSI
i knew the plane crash answer because of walter white from breaking bad.
JJ can’t lose. Not even on trivia based gameshows
Vik lost interest in the video right after they lost 🤣🤣🤣
Ksi is amazing he needs to sing holiday more his best song by far #bigfan of his and zerkaa
As much as u grow up.. U start believing in mr.beast strategy
43:18
Simon and Ethan repping gymshark
The million pound drop is such a good show
Omg Vik and Ethan, I’m shocked . That was a tough question
"what is a Wombat" Australians are mad rn
Not the best sideman vid
JJ and Ethan smashed that. Well done lads.
Harry hosted videos are hilarious
Vikk: that's density! 😭
JJ and Ethan are goated, rest of them are jus jealous over KSI. Thats not including josh
JJ got the brainy specs power-up.
sidemen got me googling wombat poop.
“Its science vs the alphabet”, tobi 😂😭
Poor from vik and josh
Shout out to beta squad
We've seen Ethan and jj winning in a general knowledge gameshow
Sidemen sundays are getting even more dead every time
that last question was way too easy, pretty sure it's common knowledge that jellyfish reproduce asexually
JJ looks good in the glasses ngl
One of the sidemen turned into a goat right here 39:26
The category is LGBTQ icons. The question- "What is Ethan Behzinga Paynes favorite video games"  Lmao underrated roast for sure
Someone watched zerka stream to get that wombat question someone told josh in gta 😂
This was low budget for some reason The prize pool is giant but the setup was very meh
I can’t believe they thought nikocado was 120, I’m 120 and no where near that big, yes i have more muscle than him but im still fat
Classic Harry, Using trick questions learnt from sidemen reacts channel loool
harry being half dressed up 💀
I know they don't actually get to keep the money but it's funny how JJ always wins the most out of all the Sidemen.
A wombat is some sort of bat 🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♂️💀 It's a overgrown rat with no tail 😂 straight up
Hey I got one of these on gta online
19:50    20:40  31:17    32:12
Monaco
Plane crash docs after this episode 📈📈📈
Why’s Tobi wearing H3 pattern
*Ancient History* : Where was Josh Zerkaa born ?  *V* *I* *O* *L* *A* *T* *I* *O* *N*
as an australian listening to people incorrectly guessing what a wombat is hurts, no vic it isn’t little they are quite big, and no harry they definitely aren’t bats.
Actually (23:00) human poo is always curly but since we are using toilets and is  it not a flat surface it does not curle
Josh is vik b
Video ends, search history contains wombat poo and kangaroo vaginas!
I love how ethan and jj got the last question right bc of sidemen reacts that tells u sidemen reacts is useful in lots of ways
was a clip cut out at 20:46??
lovely to see the two people that used to beef form chemistry more than the rest of the guys. ETHAN AND JJ ARE FUCKIN SICKKK! BANGIN VIDEOO
Outro litterally makes the watchtime🔥🔥
The non plane crash questions being about plane crashes was so funny, and Simon's comment at 51:22 is hilarious
19:20 Never Drown With Remy Brown
Love how JJ and Ethan won, made the others so vexed😂
tbh why even watch it when the questions aren't fair.
Cube 💩, that’s interesting
bro vik is a god
Tobi: Which COUNTRY mostly plays that sport… Also Tobi: Asia 😂😂😂
josh forcing the lingo is starting to get annoying not gunna lie.
Wii fat is now a cult classic 😂😂😂
OMG there all here
Harry slaps the money down with no mercy
JJ put the knowledge in ksi to good use this time lmao 😭
Why not tinder
This is amazing 🤣🤣🤣 this should be an actual game show for rich people losing their money for a good cause 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
The ome thing i knew was the plane crash 😭😭. I had a phase of watching crash documentary and i recalled the details of the klm crash
The fact that Vik and Josh didn't try to strangle Harry is just amazing.....
Give us sidmen tinder   Or stephantries vs 20 women
Better underdog story than Leicester City’s title tale
Knowledge SI strikes again
Best ending
Did anyone else hear the thing tobi said on viks and josh's 1st question he said science and alphabet lollll
JJ is pissed at losing money cause of crypto
32:56 toxic t
K.S.I really describes all the sidemen and it shows how the first two made there bag Vic with knowledge and taking home his riches and dubs from cod and jj with strength for his boxing dubs...
Somehow the 2 idiots won. Oh I love the SIDEMEN 😂😂😂
54:52 A. MILK
Harry needs to always be the host of game show videos. He's too good at it
Ethan and Josh wearing new Merch. Kap
Wait Harry really just said a wombat is some sort of bat 😂
The end was hilarious
Love to see JJ and Ethan get the W
Do we actually think they got the money though
And the rich get richer (KSI)
That ending tho
The end was so sidemen😂🤣😭
Jj actually cant lose.
Ethan and KSI are goated.
All Australians at the wombat question
why is no one talking about how it says "shape of me"
Crazy JJ always does the best on sidemen trivia sundays
Josh calling sidemen members casuals if they don’t have side + but what if ppl don’t got money
Need 4 speed 2 is 4 Gs only
G. I. JANE Cards
Josh know why the shape of the wombats poo is cos of gta Rp lmao
This video defo the best video of the year so far 🔥🔥🔥🔥
lit ep.
all the south americans(Surinamers 🇸🇷) watching Vik and Josh putting all their money on everything except brazil like 💀💀💀💀💀💀 also, it's French Guyana,not Guinea 😆
discount code?
The Icons and Ancient History had me dead 😂
Do they mean French Guiana?
Boiling temperature of milk is 95°C
The K stood for Knowledge today indeed good win JJ and Ethan
v good vid
25:16 tobi: "quantum science or the alphabet" LMAOO
Me: eating and watching a sidemen video Harry: what is the shape of a bat poo?
I love a game show.
JJ looking good with glasses !!!
Lets all appreciate the amount of effort this man puts in his videos, amazing. Keep grinding bro, I love the videos
honestly not surprised jj knew the answer to the last question
Man said French Guinea 😂💀😂
This is one of the best sidemen videos
i'm pretty sure they spelt bermondsey wrong
They are so natural at this now it’s a joke. It’s like a bunch of friends playing a fun game. Bruv people forget the amount of cameras and crew that films them. So happy to see them smash it now
Lfg
Fire vid
Josh gained weight ? Looking better than the rest
JJ and Ethan are so godlike. They respect each other so much
Elite video
JJ & Ethan make the best duo
If Canada counts the United States was right cause the us and Canada have the longest border period
58:27 Best way to end off the video. Harry rigging, Ethan and Ksi raging
I fcking loved this video😂😂😂got me dyingg
Vik looks so stoned hahahaha
Harry took it personal when Vik at Josh got their question wrong🤣🤣
josh got the wombat question told to him in RP last week 😂
Vik is only annoying because he can’t stand still
I knew the plane crash answer and I was yelling the whole time I watch that show mayday all the time
'' We was fat bro'' 🤣
Love when jj and Ethan are on a team lol
“I don’t know where Tenerife is” is Simon retarded?😂
Plane crashes was a topic 🤣
Wii fat bro
ngl the questions werent that hard-
The ending was too good
BAHHAHAHAHA FEEL BAD FOR VIKK AND JOSH
great video, Hilarious
Didn't know Ed released a song called "Shape of me" xD
32:30. incredible. can’t wait to see people cry about this
This is one the best sidemen sundays we came across with, loved the video ❤😂☺ The sidemen teasing each other's is the best part
Nah bro the lgbtq joke with Ethan literally made my jaw drop lol
JJ been winning so much these days man
There actually isn’t a standard boiling point for milk due to the different chemical compositions.
W sidemen Sunday 😂😂
the sidemen tobi duo, one’s got the brain and one‘s got the… throat
Yeeessh jj and Ethan came thru I lowkey thought they would do the worst but man . Also is it me or has in all the games shows lately whoever teams with jj ends up winning my guy really is lucky af
Ethan and Jj were a sick team, COME ON BOYS
Vik and Josh were stressinggg lmaoo
Banger
And I though Americans were supposed to be bad at geography. The two smartest sidemen. That’s like one of the most common geography questions ever. Plus French Guiana isn’t even a territory it’s an overseas department. It is straight up France
Vamo Brasil!!!!
i've said it before and i'll say it again a golden doodle is not a dog breed, it's a mutt stop ruining dog breeds to try and make more.
32:47-33:00 is hilarious and made me choke of laughter
I love how they all match shoes with other person like was it planed? And absolutely love watching y’all’s videos there always enjoyable❤️
We need this again but switch up the teams! Loved this video idea🤝
38:18 is where everyone staters like a glitch in the matrix
WHY IS IT JJ KEEPS GETTING RICHER WITH GAMES IN SIDEMEN INCLUDING MONEY
Love to see Ethan and JJ chemistry
Ethan and Jiddle elite duo! 😎🔥👏
Sadge, none of them knew Ratchet and Clank
first decent video in months congrats
As an american ive never heard of this gameshow
Why is it always Tenerife?
'Nice...'
Aye not gonna lie tho Harry would be a good flight attendant
Nikocado avocado is 6ft 5
french guiana is not french guinea ........................................................................................................, was very sad when harry got this wrong
1:00:30 see sidemen reacts is educational
Made my day😂😂😂 ethan and ksi did really good they were really funny smashed it
Harry is the best game show host out of the sidemen
No matter what happens, KSI always wins the money.
Définition of life in her pure form
This was so sick until the last round. Harry just ruined the questions. Kept the hard question for others. Then ruined all tension in it.
Them talking about what a wombat is just making every Aussie viewer going mad
Tobi: If we lose, I'm used to it. I'm a United fan too. Me: *Laughter followed by sadness noises*
37:29 Josh, just to say that all of Canada is under England. the province of Québec was a France's territory but after losing a battle with England, France gave England the territory that has become the province of Québec
Simon saying UFC is a sport has led me to clicking off the video
Do the goats reply tho?
“I don’t know where Tenerife is”, this man just showed his middle class 😂😂
Nah, nah. Harry stiffed Vikk/Josh with the ‘largest French border’ question.  The wording of that question was confusing and stupid.
How did I know the plane crash question wtf 😂😂😭
Sidemen reacts has got these guys trivia knowledge pumped up ksi and Ethan banged it twice!!!
The game show budget has gotten better this time around
Do amount us 10k games please
Josh has a fear of constipation and knows it: wins a million. Ethan finally knows a question: They change the question
BURMONDSEY???? WHO SPELT THAT
The fact Ethan and jj both knew the last question answers was hilarious
Last questions were perfect for Ethan and JJ. One was Ethans video, and the other was a question about vaginas.
" nah WII fat Bro "
My grandad passed away just over two weeks, i’m wondering if anyone will send some donations for collection happening at his funeral
nahh josh was jokes in this one 😂😂😂
haven't seen JJ wear glasses in a while lol
Of course jj would know the last question lmaoooo
Bro JJ and Ethan are the best 😂😂
Best moments 14:38 32:20 36:45 (Onwards)
I mean that last question was such bullshit, who doesn't know that Jellyfish reproduce asexually?
No offense or anything just wondering, Do they actually take the money though?
great vid lads
I guess mothers like Vik LOL
Vik just takes over the decisions and I am amazed there was a Sidemen reacts that JJ didn't sleep through and knew the answer. 😅
The first question was a bit distasteful I must say
This setting/background is horrror
1:01:25 toby "who are we waving"
JJ unlocked a new level with those glasses 🤣🤣🤣
JJ always surprise me in these game shows
Ethan the type of guy that if he gets a little laugh from a joke or a bit. He will do it again 4 times 🙄🤣
59:00 chaos started🤣🤣
Wii fat
Aight, no one call me a nerd, but french guinea is not a thing. Thats like calling Namibia, South west africa or calling Zimbabwe, Rhodesia
Hi
Hahaha I knew the plane crash answer
KSI is Crazy!!!!!!!!!
French Guiana would like a word with Harry 😂
footasylum also does this, it’s entertaining
Ksi keeps winning these game shows no wonder he is one of the richest sidemen
Is Canada owned by France? Was that a serious question?
Those glasses really brought the knowledge
Great vid boys
Them doing Quiz Shows needs to happen way more often, these are by far my favourite Sidemen videos. Harry as the host is by far the best part of it all 😂
Being a geography nerd and watching the border question is a pain
WWWWW
Harry is a snake
Sidemen tenabell
Ethan and jj banged
nah wii fat bro
As an Australian hearing Harry say a wombat is a form of bat is so funny
Where did josh get that gillet can’t find it on sdmn clothing
harry's gameshows are the best
months and we finally get another banger let’s gooooo
i like the commitment to making people think its actually real money
Mispronounced French Guiana, but I'll take it
Btw gosh literally only started speaking 18 mins into the vid
I knew it was Brazil
Wombats are not little haha but do have cubed poo
Bruh this looks so fun to actually play
So this vid is a betec version of footasylum secure the bag
“Cancer of the head” had me crying
This one makes up for the past two!
Just love how jj and Ethan both knew the last question
It’s French Guiana not french Guinea for anyone wondering btw 39:30
Elite video!!!!
Fair play to JJ and Ethan 😂😂 wonderful end to the video
the two dumbest sidemen won the most money
Was meant to go to be over and hour ago !!! No regrets !!! Great content as always
wow
man i really did not expect the ending here
Ksi letting everyone know why knowledge is in his name dam
Canada isn't owned by France so why did they picked that
Hello
20:40
The internet has ruined me my first thought about the political question was oh if sadiq barely survived a plane crash it was probably a hijacking fail probably my humor is way to dark sometimes
JJ would know what animal has 3 Vagina
Just to add we do fun fact friday at work wombats also use their square poo to build walls against their predators 😂
Air crash investigation is sick
I thought Harry supported Chelsea 😂
19:18 never drown with remy brown.
Ethan what a legend in the last question
Bruh, French Guinea? Come on lads.. .
This was a goated video. Love that the Sidemen intellects didn't get out with much money, and weird trivia got Ethan and JJ with a dub
1 stack is double my yearly wage, how mad is that….
Ethan the LGBTQ icon
Harry moving like Michael Masi
I loved JJ and ethans round pissed myself laughing at when JJ said I Know this 😂
KSI and Behz are an underrated team, they work off eachother so well and Ethan knows how to handle JJ's semantics so well, GOATED
JJ almost missed a heart beat
49:00
£112500 for both of them fair play ❤🎉
Tobi is so stupid I wish he wasn’t in the videos. Boring dry guy.
Rigged video! Waste of an hour 👎🏽
K stand for knowledge 😂😂😂😂😂
When josh said “is part of Canada owned by France” as a Canadian I did the biggest face palm
This is sick! Last time I saw this was Darkestman in footasylum.
I knew the French border question I would have put straight up all on it
anything to do with vagina I would expect JJ to know ...😂😂😂😂
An absolute banger of a vid guys! Well done 👌🏻
The banter was fire
31:22 😂
Wombat poo google searches after this video flying!!!
The LGBT Icon question killed me 😭😭😭
Great video ❤️🔥
That was the first sidemen sunday I really enjoyed in a long time
The confidence of ethan and ksi is unreal
I wish they were actually playing for the money
It's ironic how JJ and Ethan knew both the answers from the 2 last categories they had to choose from. Harry had to do something about it but failed😂
@18:30 never drown with Remy Brown 😥
Damn thats back to back wins for JJ on these gameshows
Great video !!
FRENCH GUINEA LMAO
We need a part 2, this has been my fav vid on the channel
Jaed's random facts being used somewhere atleast LUL
20:40 to 21:00 is such an underrated bit of this video. tobi’s sarcasm, simon’s stare. even ethan’s pointing is funny and the ‘hold that’ tops it all off.
POV looking for nico Avocado in the comments
im still confused by the French guinea question...shouldnt it have been USA's border with Quebec as the correct answer? 39:25
Vik mad annoying lol
39:34 French Guiana* not French Guinea
harry should have known that jj would know that last question
Harry Is a snitch letting them off Monaco bordering france
jj looks like deji with them glasses on  lmao
44:09 Low-key surprised how they got this one. It wasn’t in my history textbook lmao.
Wii fat 😂
Pov: ur looking at Ksi’s crypto history
It's French Guiana but we move.
Vikk rocking the LRR jacket🔥
Too good
1:00:40 'Kangeroo'
TENERIFE IM FROM THERE
Lmao Sidemen Reacts has made these guys so much smarter
The game shows are so sick
ethan and ksi are the best team 😂😂😂😅😅 i wish they woulda trolled each other a lil more man they worked too well together on this one
Am I the only one that googled wombat poo?
Hi
58:56 Harry tried to pull a Michael Masi 🤣
Wii fat brooo 😂😂😂
Just a banger vid as always, innit?
So gooood
Don’t pretend Tobi is a musician
Simon was hating this episode, watching JJ and Ethan.
£12,500, £0, £112,500 each
Coming straight out of left field, I can't BELIEVE how amazingly well JJ and Ethan did, I'm so gassed, holy crap
That xix overshirt Ethan wearing looks very nice 😍
uhh damn JJ looks fiiine with those glasses
This was a banger lads do more gameshows like this
The knowledge was strong with this one.
WII FAT LMFAOOOO
20:43 Tobi is too legendaryy!!!🤣
The production🔥🔥
9:38 *Vsauce music kicks in*
KSI & Behzinga = Content.
I was screaming Brazil as it borders french guiyana
The celebration was elite
soy de colombia y sus videos estan mejor que las telenovelas  jajajaaja  un saludo desde chile...
seeing them answer the border question was infuriating
Finally something new
The happiness on JJ face when he realized he knew what animal has three vaginas lol love the content guys.
This video’s ending is amazing
Best Sidemen Sunday in a WHILE
Harry is ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
My respect for Ethan increased a ten fold after his favorite video game was underground 2. I’m a die hard fan for that game.
Yo why did it say Kangaroo on the board but Kangeroo on the monitor seems like the sidemen don’t know how to spell after all those spelling bees
Am I nerd if I knew the plane crash one?
Its french Guiana like guyana not guinea still
Harry looks like hes ready for a big cook little cook audition 😅
Noice
Quarks fall under particle physics more than quantum. Also Vikk was wrong to say that electrons are made of quarks as electrons are fundamental particles too called leptons.
Finally watching it❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Sidemen Sunday on my Birthday. lets gooo, thanks for the gift.
great video again, though i feel like the shithousery on the french border question was stupid to the point where it just made the rest of the video slightly less enjoyable for me
Hate how they made the questions harder for vik and josh
Harry is such a scam artist lmao and in the end it didn’t work to his favor
Damn, Harry even said “French Guinea” and not “French Guyana”. French Guinea does not exist lol
French border question L question
Simon n tobi finished in 25 minutes then here comes Josh n vik and there first question says it all 😂
Josh made me crease throughout this video lmaooo
Omg early for once
Yesterday was watching plane crush documentary about ilushin and Boeing clash, where Tenerife plane crash also has been mentioned)))
Legendary masterclass from JJ and Berzinga😂🐐
Best ending mannn!!!!!
dope
what happened to jj why is he blinking like that
Notice how Vik and Josh are referred to as the smartest yet they won no money and Ethan and JJ are referred to as 2 of the dumbest but they won the most money
20:19 For Remy Brown
Code??
Wtf is that set? 😂
Seemed to acted out at points! They knew what fans would react too!!!!
Nah sidemen were defo drinking before this one  Tooo funny
25:17 Tobi “Its science or the alphabet” this had me dead 😂😂😂😂
French Guiana*
It’s the fact that I know about the plane crash harry is talking about. I watch strange documentaries too😭
Ethan and JJ are such a funny duo 😂😂❤️
Harry casually shouting FrEnCh GuInEa when its French Guiana... either way no other comments, REALLY NICE VIDEO, keep up the good work!
The ending was epic lol ethan jj ans Harry make me laugh propper entertainment right there.
Wombat poo is actually caused from their intestinal structure. Since it’s quite stretchy and tight, the poo is molded into a cube shape
Another banging video
18:31 Tayyyble Tennis RIP Remy Brown
Can we all just admit...... KSI CANT F***KING LOSE!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂
This was unironically inspiring, the smartest ones failed arrogantly choosing answers without consoling to one another while the dumb ones got the W working their big brains together having learnt from their past trivia mistakes
Jj always wins, what a big brain
one of the best sidemen sundays of this year so far
Nc teamwork jj and ethan
Knowledge
POV: will smith after the first question
Ethan: I know this *Harry cancels and moves on to another question* JJ: I know this
Simon - "What is a Wombat?" Harry - "its some form of bat" , Ethan "Yeah its bat family"
how is toby gonna say he doesnt watch youtube when his whole career is based off of it. smh wolf in sheep clothing
that last question was so lucky, the only time jj wasn't asleep in a reacts
Shoutout Footasylum
Sundays is the best cuz of these men
Khamzat won it
Table tennis
46:56 wtf why he try push the money Maybe old habit never die
KSI reclaims the K
KSI always winning
do they actually get the money?
1:00:40 Kangeroo misspelled on screen.
Thanks to JJ, we have "Is it dog?", and now "Pick dog den" 🤣
Vik is a carry
Here before 1 million views
Shoutout from TENERIFE !!!!
32:34 That one there was a violation
KSI knew that answer because he saw it in a reaction video of theirs haha
Love when Harry hosts 😂 mans funny af no matter what
That LGBTQ icon joke was the funniest thing ever. Dont think they clocked it properly tho the moment past
Was that real money?
Wombats poo is cubed because it gets compacted into a pellet like object
13:50 as someone who has been binge watching Mentor Pilot videos, I am happy to say I am also weird like Harry and knew the answer.
Ethan and JJ are an elite duo
Table Tennis is clear of Basketball
Bros how don’t any of em know what a wombat is
nick avocado weighs four of me
NOOO THE CROSSBAR CHALLENGE QUESTION THAT WAS SO PAINFUL TO WATCH
Josh's humor is so underrated😂
I swear ksi is always part of a winning team. I guess he really can’t lose 😂.
1:00:39 I love how everyone doubted them and they still won
Who would’ve thought the most clever side members left with nothing and the least clever side members gained the most😂
Didn't expect JJ and Ethan to get a W   They are both underrated fr
does jj have a problem with his eyes he blinks a lot
Favourite Sidemen Sunday for 2022 so far 😂
56:12 brilliant Simon
45:56 “lEts gO!” 😂
I was so gassed when JJ knew the answer for the last question, that's our fatneek, must know the thing w the gyal them
Good to see man like  remy mr table tennis featured in the video.
OH THAT WAS A BANGER OF A VIDEO
fam
me scrolling through comments when i heard josh say wii fat 🤣🤣
Harry is the greatest host of all time
This title is misleading
Good to know I am not the only one that enjoys plane crash documentaries
That finale was so funny! Great Sidemen sunday once again! :)
Josh threw Like 300k away cause He lieks GTA damn
Josh is the worst at stuff like this he thinks hes always right hahaha
Do they actually keep the money?
1:00:00 Wait i know this. 😈🤣🤣
Hilarious video lads 😂
32:56 HAHAHA
They’re shooting a lot of videos in one day btw, just in case some y’all are confused
32:32 LMAOOO
Man said “Wii Fat”
JJ watches RuPaul??!!
Bangerrrrr
9:15 why is spurs up there????
32:03 HAHAHAH
As soon as I heard ja say “ ik this” I died from laughter and joy
Obviously these game shows are way better than hide and seek #WENEEDMORE
31:57 LMAO
The problem with these games is that they have to purposely lose money to progress the game. Hahaha 😂
harry is too jokes as host lmaooo need him as host more often
I loved this video. Good job 🔥❤
100.5 degrees rounds up to 101 degrees not 100. Smh W2s
The look on Harry's face when jj knew the final answer 🤣
I wonder what they are all up to that they needed to record a bunch of videos on the same day
“The Return of LGBTQ Icons”  😂😂
Can we talk about how jj said idk who nick acardo is when he’s literally done like 5 mucbangs and is nick not one of the original mucbangers or something I could be wrong and feel free to ridicule me if so
I just realized by the outfits that this is the same day they saw the PRIME car made by Calfreezy
Yes JJ Ethann
Oi jj really does have a massive forehead
All the side men are in this video
Josh gray hair or was it just me?
Vik is a baller and be going all in the questions
Amazing video but feel bad for Vik n Josh
French Guiana , pronounced gee an ah, is a tiny country 😂😂
Great ending, DROP THE TING Hahahah
1:00:16 is my favorite moment 😂 "Wait... I know this"
25:15 tobie cracks me up man joker
Harry bums mentor pilot videos
woot 2 of these questions i found yesterday xD because of some person had an incident and i fiound a cube bomb in the toilet of an Human :O sooo massiveee
He basically told them it wasn't USA and then literally told them it wasn't monaco and they still lost everything on that question OOF
Never drown with Remy Brown
49:09 vikk with the banter   ye lyric as well
Jj and Ethan had such easy questions
I can`t help but feel like Vik and Josh would`ve made it further if the boys stopped screaming at them lmao
R2D2 when Luke's stunting through space: 39:10
Smashed it boys
Bruh never go on a quiz show made by Harry haha
Harry is such a amazing host! “We have either geography or plane crashes.” 😂 amazing delivery Harry! 😂
1:00:30 bro jellyfish don’t have any vaginas what is that question
Sidemen vids are getting shiter by the week and I love them not even a hater but come one man bring back some holiday videos man
1080p what happened to 4K? but… the video was still good!!
5:55 shambles of a music question  19:54 didn't ask 😬 20:46 Simon's mum is an animal😱 32:55 wii fat 🤣😭 39:07 one of the dumbest moments by sidemen🤦🏾‍♂️ 52:18 tobi did jj dirty 🤣🤣🤣🤣 58:57 cancel the question  1:00:31 harry face and they still won
2:30 5. Wanted to look like 2pac.
I honestly thought tobi and simon were smarter. I wouldve walked away with more money
21:40 I knew the answer to that yrs ago . Lmao
32:30 ffs that is amazing
This is good content, we need part 2
French "Guyana" not Guinea harry
Who else looked up wombat poo?
vikk is amazing. SIMPLY AMAZING
The country bordering Brazil is French Guiana, not French Guinea but I'm sure Harry meant to say French Guiana
Love JJ's glasses ! 🥸
French Guyana not Guinea
jj whit the glasses tho
23:58 He really said havana una na lmaooo
Who knew jj actually pays attention on sidemen reacts
*The K in KSI actually made sense for once*
Never drown on remy brown
This video came out at 3oclock in the morning at malaysia.
1:00:41 they didnt spall kangaroo right
French guinea isn't big it's just almost entirely surrounded by Brazil
Pick dog den
1:40 Imagine if the question for ancient history category was “What’s Josh’s birthday?”  Edit: I GUESSED IT BASICALLY
Broooo I knew all of them for the first game 🤯🤯🤯 now send me the money 😂
the reason why josh knew the wombats squared poo answer was because elena vega had told him recently on gta rp
Zerkaa and tobi are honestly the most boring sidemen  Zerkaa is just annoying with everything he says  - his energy, personality, ability to receive jokes, etc
The kicks Tobi picked up would have been LIT with look that Harry has
I think the title of Smartest Sideman needs to rewarded to JJ and Ethan. Other mans got smoked!
atleast credit Footasylum
Imagine Will Smith being here.Lots of slaps 🤣.
It's not French Guinea it's French Guiana!
Harry is the best gameshow host. Dare to change my mind!
Look at my man tobi at 17:42
They spelt Bermondsey wrong. Just wanted to get that out there 🙂
I'm with Harry, plane crash investigation shows are amazing, great binge watch material
Thought about this game show a week ago for the first time in like 5 years and I thought it would be perfect for Sidemen, and now they’re doing it lol
great vid
Fun fact I already knew Harry was gunna be host thru calfreezys prime mobile vid
Josh made me crack up this week! Great video boys
People searching for wombat poop 📈📈📈
Is that real money
I need more of these
thats right weird im literally watching air crash investigation on my tv while this is on my phone and im on that actual one tenerife the dutch pilot was rushing to get of the ground otherwise he could have got fired and i think it said it took of 500 lifes
The team we expected to come last, won the most, and the team we expected to come in first, won nothing.
I died laughing when the "LGBTQ icons" question was about Ethan
Vik looks shell-shocked from what happened in the games he and the sidemen been playing in this room
tobi would spoon a m om and ghost her like always. hii tobyy
they did 4 weeks of vids in this one day
They try not to make a scuffed video and the universe delivers them a scuffed ending!!!
32:23 when I heard Ethan I thought of the Sidemen Olympics irl 💀
Ethan jumping around is so cute
lol
20:43 I think they cut a part in the video.. cuz JJ’s laughing at something all of a sudden and the edit looks like it’s be cut.
Love the ending 😂😂💖
The first drop was equal to two and a half episodes of foot asylums. Well done lads y’all went big time
Spill your guts v2?
Big bogger
21:08 Josh knows cuz of Tommy T
On the last question JJ really utilised knowledge
Broooo 20:38 got me cracking up😂😂
30:15 I actually started crying 😭
Them talking about plan crashes and I have a flight at 5m tomorrow 😂😭
56:35
Sidemen never heard of Quebec? Place was independent before Canada itself, its a province now. Awesome place. Lets play a game 😆... where does Xqc come from 😉?
French Guinea was dissolved in 1958 so technically.......
This one’s a Dub 👌🏼
5:32 is now One Dance by Drake.
the genuine happiness i feel when i forget about a sidemen sunday till its on my recommended
Harry really said french guinea with chest even though its french guiana ii cantttttttttttttttttttttttttt
51:31
This was dope
I had to pause this to search what a wombat is. For anyone else wondering they are nothing like bats
JJ is helping them cheat at 7:14 is too funny!
This video is going to be iconic xd
Vik and Josh got stiffed, wish the other teams would get as difficult questions in gameshows like these
the two set 8's won the most
I actually really enjoyed JJ this episode
Didnt ask was the funniest thing
I was shouting at Simon and Tobi for that Tenerife one, pretty easy one.
when harry said that a wombat was a type of bat, the australian in me wheezed
How is no one talking about how late they uploaded it fair enough if they had problems but that's mad still
Harry is rocking the pyjama pants and suit look
6:03 Shape of me 😂
One of the best sidemen videos👏🏻
Nobody: Vik: “Oh its a marsupium!”
25:17  I feel like the editors missed this comment and would have beeped it out!!!! My guy ganna get canceled🤣
Sidemenreacts came in clutch
Talk about a clutch victory! Sidemen Reacts for the win!!
Underrated lads they should be at at least 50mil subs by now
The fact that I knew that airplane crash answer man I feel weird
Nice Video!
Ethan and JJ are so GOATED looool
They had a perfect chance to do a fun facts with harry. with the yellow border with harry’s face when he was talking about the planes crashing.
23:48 the way Ethan said this IM CRYING
The sound jj made was weird
when jj and ethan are on the same trivia team, no one is safe. those guys know the weirdest facts most people dont
At this point I think the sidemen are just flexing on us.
got to love ‘ shape of me ‘
The lgbtq icon question from harry was brazzy lmaoo
what glasses r jj wearing?
Absolutely astounding plays from Ethan and JJ
Too worried about giving Vik and Josh hard questions, didn’t have any for the last team 🤣
I lost it when harry was so disappointed with Josh and Vik for not getting the geo q correct. Too funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m just really curious is it fake or is it actual money
As always they don't disappoint.. enjoyed watching
Please do a spend 100k challenge
We stan our LGBTQueen Ethan.
I think I would absolutely boss this!
Sidemen are so famous that each one of them has a category
Tobi's "Science or the alphabet" at 25:14 went unnoticed, that was so good
How much is a kangaroo?
FRANCE THE MODERN DAY COLONISERS DISGRACE EVIL PEOPLE. ENEMIES OF HUMANITY  🖕🖕🖕🖕 FRANCE 🖕🖕🖕🖕
Bit of a L not gonna lie
wii fat LOL

They do a really good job pretending to be excited about money lol
Pick dog den

JJ and Ethan are a to funny duo man
KSI always win this harry quizzes
I’m surprised they didn’t put “1,000,000” in the title instead for the algorithm 🤣
💜💜💜
The k in ksi
Harry is actually a really good host he knows when to sit back and let the others talk, something some hosts fail to do.
I love it when Harry is the game show host of the video, he always makes the best questions and answers 😂
JJ and Ethan should have made that last question a double or nothing. Lol
32:50
I almost spit my drink out at the last question 🤣
Best video in weeks 😩
Jj and Ethan actually make a good team when they try so entertaining
Nah but the SDMN clothing edit tho 😲
Yayy they mentioned Malaysia 🤣🤣
Ethan and JJ together are jokes 💯😂😭
14:00 breaking bad would have saved them
I need a sidemen set tour cuz this is crazy
Whens that vest coming out Josh🔥
39:23 the French Guiana border with Brazil is 730km, but the Quebec U.S border is 813km. “Ya doughnuts”
its french guyana not guinea
Miss this game show on channel 4 was sick
No it’s just less
Shoutout to Buckmore Park- Medway is massive!!
Love the content
Ethan went from thinking cows drink milk to winning £225,000 on a different game show

Damn, JJ looking smart with them glasses
This an was epic show sidemen carry sundays
A”Milk
Bogs face when they knew the ans

I LOVE THIS
GREAT VIDEO BOIS
IF THERE WAS SUBSCRIBER IN THE GAME SHOW THRY EARN MONEY WHERE ARE THEY
100.5 degrees to the nearest degree is 101 by the way
Super video
LET'S GOOOOO JJ AND ETHAN
😭😭😭😭sometimes I forget how retarded and immature the sidemen are
21:50 JOSH KNOWS IT BECAUSE OF MEELO AND MARIE THEY TOLD HIM IN RP😭
It's NOT French GUINEA It's French GUYANA
Harry is the first other person I know that owns a Havanese, legend
Milks boiling point is 95 Celsius
Use to love this show. I’d always ask my dad what the answer was & he’d always know the answers even for the most random questions, swear he could’ve won half a mil if he went on.
Watching sidemen Sunday is the highlight of my weekends
They have shapped bones in a way so the poo comes out cubed i think
How much money did Vik lose from other Sidemen members? 🤣
This video is tops ethan and jj made it so mutch funnyer
man i love it when Harry is the host of a video. he dresses up and talks all professional like a real tv host and its so uncharacteristic of his personality and his youtube history that its ironically hilarious. Best Sidemen Host. haha
jj's bandana getting wider n wider each video
Footasylum tings
I haven’t laughed so much in a long time😂😂😂😂😂
A banger here
Bog is the best host of anything in history
Bruh that last question for vik and josh was bs
i love these game shows
Idk if it's a good idea to flash a million to the public but that's just me
30:04.  51:26.  58:52.  39:08. 19:53 36:57
Bruh they do like 3-4 vids a day
Josh is so fkn annoying

28:13 anyone hear that lmk in comments
best sidemen sunday in a while!
harry is the best host.
Watching Josh and Vik lose on a question i knew was painful 😭
loeved jj and ethans confidence at the end
Never drown with Remy Brown “table tennis” 😢 19:15
We need a new episode of who wants to be a millionaire!
LGBTQ Icons! Wooooo!!!!!! Ah, no, it was a joke :(  MY PRIDE.
I heard that Jesse breaking bad reference
Ethan’s “PUT IT BACK” when Harry gave them a hint 😭😭😭
the boiling temperature for milk is 112 I looked it up and it said that
Anyone else wanna bring back side craft?
Ethan and JJ unironically is the most inspiring pair..  - we all thought they wouldn't succeed - they did better than the brains of the sidemen - they got the science question - in spite of the shithousery at the end they still got the W
brazil doesn't border french guinea, it borders french guiana
great video idea
Elite! That was fun
-Harry "Who won the 1st 10K calorie challenge?" - Ethan " Oh, I know this" *Has to change the answer to something harder - Harry "What animal has 3 vaginas?" - JJ "Oh I know this" 🤣
I feel like Harry is a great game show host
42:00
The rich just get richer
this was amazing 😂
Ethan and jj my fav duo from now on.
why do they all say table tennis like that like where did they get it from is there like a meme or something
Can u bring back the sidemen show
Honestly, any game show that has money as a prize, JJ wins it
After watching breaking bad i was screaming Tenerife
madness
Vik either takes videos too serious or not serious at all. Needs to balance it out tbh
Harry makes the best gameshow sidemen sundays
when does the hoodie tobis wearing drop please🥵 checked online just says coming soon😢 I need x
28:10  Hhhhahehh Quark
Yess I love the sidemen!
19:25 TAYBLEEEE TENNIS. Never drown with Remy Brown 😔
Ethan + JJ killed this, such a funny climax hahah
so were going to have to Watch harrry wear those pants for 3 weeks atleast
😭Ethan was just getting roasted on the whole video 😂😂
This was actually nice
Best ending, I died laughing
The LGBTQ icon question on vik & Josh was the most Savage Violation I’ve seen on a Sidemen video lol
This already has become one of the best Sunday videos of all time. The rants between the boys, the ridiculous categories, and the ending were absolutely insane 😂
Kkk
NDL
Big W love from Denmark
Madness
😂😂😂
French Guyana, not guinea.
I need that jacket Ethan is wearing 😍
Simon's stare felt like another diss track season 😳
That french border question was jokes, Malaysia couldn't be further from any of the french territories 😭
Josh once again trying to show he isn’t a bore by being obnoxious
Man said quantum physics.
just the rich got richer.
What a banging vid
shape of me?🤣
Canada was an English territory lol
Anyone else just sat smiling at the wholesome ending
Vik and Josh took one of the biggest Ls I have ever seen lmao XD.
I don't get it how JJ always wins  in these   types of shows
Love a game show sidemen Sunday
this is better than every hide and seek combined
Sidemen going downhill 700k views in 2 hours
Loving JJ’s glasses
JJ and Ethan the ultimate duo 🤣🤣🐐🐐
Watch the views boost up to at least a mill in a few hours
i love seeing ethan & jj succeed as a team since the past times theyve been a team it has not gone so smoothly as this game went 🤣🤣💀
Interesting conversation about bat poo
Ethan looks ghostly white in this
Can't put a question about p***y and expect jj not to know the answer  (R*pe face)
This is why we love Harry!!
Will: Keep My Wifes Name Out Your Mouth  Harry: Hide Your Wife I've Got A Knife
Petition for ksi to drop his half in my bank
43:40 unrated by bez😭😭😭
21:50 I would of described it as a like beaver but yh
31:00 was that a ethan coming out of the close video ???
56:55 “stormzy” had me dead😭
Seeing them not know what a wombat is as an Australian hurts
Great ending
French Guiana 🚫  French guinea✔️😂😂
Ethan’s memory is Insane
KSI got them Ethan glasses
This is the worst video i have ever watched from the sidemen. So disappointing.
Proof that the rich do get richer 😂
ksi 🤓
Another great Sidemen Sunday
goddamn this video was amazing!!
This is the biggest plot twist. Vikk and josh got nothing ….. jj and Ethan won 🏅
best sidemen sunday this year
I love how they're just looking up at a wall. Do they actually expect us to believe there is a massive semi-circle screen there?
is it bad I knew it was tenerife for the airplane crash?
Absolute GOATED sidemen fam i appreciate the laughs
Jesus Loves Yall And Is The Way To Everlasting Life🤍🙏✝️
It’s actually ”French Guiana” but good question still !
That ending was such a Rollercoaster 😂
Ksi looking leng with those glasses tho let’s be real
Hate to say it, but all the bench getting loud whenever Harry tried to clarify a question was just annoying, and in my opinion made the game less interesting by far. Specifically with the French border question, if he had been able to simply say French territory when he wanted to, it would have been more engaging to see if they could figure out an answer, rather than having to zone out 3 of the sidemen shouting at them without a clear idea of the question.  Regardless, good vid, just a couple spots I skipped over cause the non-competetors were drowning out the actual content
Thats why jj is the richest
Surely basketball is more popular than table tennis. This has to be wrong
pretty sure nikocado isnt 5' 6", i think he is over 6'
Discount code??
JJ’s movements with “She did this madness” had me cracking up. 😂
I love seeing harry as a host
NGL as an engineer I didn't know the  boiling point of milk was nearly the same as the boiling point of water but I suppose it makes sense.
jj and ethan winning like 50k and vik and josh not even making it past the first round is SO JOKES
French Guinea never gets fair rep 😭
30:54 that is why Vikk is more rich then everyone even JJ not counting crypto. The guy goes with his guts xD
51:40 Harry too funny
Harry's lowkey a wizard in Geography
✌️✌️
This SIDEMEN SUNDAY XIX is an absolute BANGER 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😎👏👏💪🏾💪🏾💸💵💸
Sidemen Sunday lesson: the rich get richer
what kinda jacket is ethan wearing. which collection is that?
No one: Le Harry: CANCEL THE QUESTION
love it
brazil doesnt border french guinea wtf🤣🤣🤣
BANGER my fav vids are the games shows
W
Imagine sdmn x adidas
bruh wtf 20:20 basketball has 2.2 billion fans whilst table tennis has 450 million
HOW TF DO THEY NOT KNOW ABOUT FRENCH GUIANA???? France and Brazil is thousands of miles away from me but I knew about it.
THE END WAS EPIC
idk man i feel kinda bad for vik and josh even if harry is helping em a tiny bit they are ggetting the hardest questions so far plus harry helped simon and tobi a bit too and no one complained
Harry: "what is the boiling point of milk to the neariest degree"  100 degrees is the correct answer Also harry: "yes milk boils at 100.5 degrees" which is 101 degrees
I learn more in these game shows by the sidemen than I do in 6 hours of school 💀
Is Vik wearing London Royal Ravens merch
14:50 funniest question, harry ever produced! 🤣🤣🤣
W vid
Love it when harry is the presenter
Reacts coming in clutch.
Wholesome ending
Bloody English people not knowing what a wombat is!! it’s Australian animal lol also they’re little but can Flip a car with ease
Did anyone notice on 10:10 Jj twitching? Hope he’s good though
"Let's do plane crashes" -Toby 2022  Me watching: this would look really bad out of context
♥️JJ s glasses
THIS ROOM IS WHERE GREAT VIDEOS ARE MADE
That ending was hilarious
This just made my day 😚💙
never drown with remy brown, rip table tennis
4:45 “shape of me” is  a banger 💀
One thing I've learned from this video is that Harry loves plane crashes
Guyana
Lmao Harry and Tobi waving bye is just cute
100.5 degrees to the nearest degree is 101 just sayin
Lmao one of the funniest endings
lets be real here we all looked up wombat poo
Real life slumdog millionaire
lol
jj in the  fakeb glasses phase
Ethan and JJ are low key smart
ووللللل
thats where u feel the need of a background soundtrack
Ksi can't lose😂😂
my favourite kind of video, plus all of the sidemen were In it. It rlly changed my mind and made me feel like they haven't reached their peak yet
they reason wombats got square poo is because their intestines contract and kind of just press form it in to the cube shape and . and a Marsupial is an animal that Cary their young usually in a pouch. like how kangaroos do it they are also Marsupials
When JJ and Ethan got BOTH the Final questions correct...  We all liked that! :)
when it comes to money, JJ always win. Split or steal, who wants to be a millionaire, lamborghini from treasure hunt, this one and many  more.
27:43 ahh Toby 🤔
can we note this is the same night calfreezy showed them the primemobile. they're all wearing the same outfits.....
good vid, shame its not real money/they don't get to keep it
Outtro sick
Course ethan gets food right and jj gets vaginas right
Ethan running around like subway surfers
48:48
jj and ethan elite
10:02 I felt that Toby :')
bog is...... PLATNUIM
ok but the blatant description has me rolling 😂
Sideman sundays videos are the best
JJ wearing glasses again?
Never doubt the intelligence of backbenchers in school.. ethan and jj proved that
This video is a banger 🔥🥶
Wii fat what a iconic line
I knew that the klm crash was gnna come out 🤣🤣🤣🤣 me and Harry have a lot in common thank god I interviewed him 🤣🤣
So happy for Ethan and JJ man, what a way to end the video 🔥🔥🔥🔥
JJ do be cute in them glasses
justice for Vik and Josh, the question was utter "Confusement"
Need sidemen helium chalange
Ethan and JJ cluthed so hard
Did I actually just hear Vikk being called BIG MAN twice bro?😂😂
Ksi is a good luck charm.. won millionaire with josh, rarely gets into bad team in holidays, and won today with ethan...
Ethan and JJ are officially the smartest sidemen
Past the days of peak sidemen content 😞
no doubt, one of my favorite sidemen videos! they’re all hilarious in this XD
39:10ish does Harry mean French Guiana or actually French guinea because French Guiana is South America butI’m near sure isn’t that big
Harry meant French Guiana not French Guinea (which is in Africa).
We fat was just a violation
Admit, the least expected team won!🤣🤣🤣 JJ n Ethan 🙇🏻
God bless spread the gospel
I am so relieved seeing that World don't need smart people to win bags ....
Sidemen reacts is low key messing up these gameshow videos. They are getting too smart with random general knowledge questions
today is a good day i just sat down with my food, went to see what i can put on while i eat and i see this video thx
Josh and Vik really don't work well as a team. I feel like they both try to be the leader and try to outsmart each other rather than work together 🤣.
Finally my airplane knowledge comes in clutch
Best conclusion to a sidemen sunday
French Guiana, is pronounced gi-yana I believe
jj always gets all the money in this kind of videos like who wants to be a millionaire lol
I live for the Harry & Vik bromance 😍
That French question was not explained properly. They got confused between French speaking and France. Harry should have clarified that he's talking about France.
Jj and Bez CLUUUUTCH 😂😂
“Science or the alphabet”
Vik:How many people play basketball outside the US.  Everybody except UK
why viki and josh got harder question
I love it how harry is smart but he’s in pj trousers lol
Bro im 5'7 12 years old and 150 kg im healthy and strong.i am living like a normal person. Its possible for him to be alive
One of their best videos in ages this. Hilarious
I swear that jj wins every trivia game😂😂
But French Guinea is in Africa, how the hell does w2s say that it shares a border with Brazil..
This may be the final Sidemen Sunday I am gonna be able to watch.  Thanks guys for everything.
Guess JJ’s finally gonna exercise
Who would've have thought
Nice
As a guy from Tenerife, it makes me sad the fact that the plane crash incident is the only thing that makes people remember my beautiful island. We have so much more to offer, yet the people only remember that incident😔😔
French Guiana
Wombats have cubed poo due too the drying of the poop in the colon and the muscular contractions that shape it that way before it completely dries.
These are the sidemen sundays we want!!
JJ and Ethan is a lethal duo
So the dumbest team wins the most  lmao
19:54 Simon was on smoke this Sunday 🤣 but in a good way.
LGBTQ icons 😂. Harry is undefeated
This is one of the funniest Sidemen videos in a while
It’s not even french guinea, it’s French Guiana 😭😭
A Banger 🤟🏻
Tommy t got no chill in this vid
They could have made it so much better with xix vod
19:55 "I didn't ask" was savage Simon!! XD
Bigdogden
19:49 That didn't ask was so cold 😂
I wasnt surprised that ethan got that milk question correct, since he answered that chase question
This is hilarious
FOOTASYLUMMMMMMMMM IYKYK 👀👀
Still can’t get over french guinea 😂 Pretty sure it’s french Gianna but still Harry is an absolute legend
@22:28 they are all huddled up to give no help at all 😂
“didn’t ask” LMFAOOOOOO
Fun fact - Harry wrote the kangaroo question from Whats good podcast
I was so frustrated on the french border one, 'cause I just learned it from tiktok.
Lol I was litterally watching a video about that plane crash before this video
i just happy to see 7 sidemen in one video
Tobi threw the whole game man
Steven tries vs 20 women
im really surprised simon doesn't know where tenerife is.
43:35 * cant wait for nick avocado to make a vid about this * 😂
44:48
french guinea is tiny
I love how Harry is talking about the Tenerife plane crash. Man’s a legend only Harry
Vik did well. That french border question was unfair.
Bro Josh and Vik literally predicted that they would end with nothing because they would get overconfident and that’s exactly what happened 😂
JJ looks so good in those glasses
Nice
What a banger video. It was fully entertaining and funny all the way through, and Ethan and jj - the 2 sidemen who are big Brain- winning a trivia game and absolutely destroying the other teams was so fun to watch.The fact that ethan and jj clutched both the last 2 questions is legitimately impressive.
I knew it would be tenerif
It's a weird coincidence to see a "plane crashes" category in your video, that is posted at the 12th anniversary of a tragedy, where the heads of the polish government died     in a plane crash.
Was it just me screaming Brazil at vik and Josh ?
Sidemen Sunday 👌👌👌
Ngl when I saw this in my notifications I wasn’t too excited but watching it was great 👍
Science keeps coming up and Harry says it's because nobody picked it, movies comes up one time, doesn't get picked and never shows up again???
did anyone else notice jj being more quiet
Bog that was rigged but they still won
Sunday completed
Who else knew it was Guiana not Guinea
The rich get richer smhhh
is it finally acc money that they get to keep? feels like it is
19:55 simon is so cold with it🥶🥶
Bro it's so cool that out of all the big brains in sidemen, JJ and Ethan are the one's who won 🤣🤣
skill-based match making no cap!!! vik and josh got it hard
amazing content from the lads as usual
🔥🔥🔥
20:40 Simon: 😐               Ethan: 👀
If the plane crashes was 9/11
I love how harry ridicules vikk and josh about not knowing french guiana while he himself calls it french guinea.
The editing on this wasn't as good as the footasylum one
Simon"i didn't ask" oh that one there was a violation
"I know this"
I wonder how many people searched up what wombat poop looks like...
Ethan's jacket looks cold af can't lie
This is the 2nd time JJ is on the same team as someone who's on the winning question🤣🤣
Shambles
"Lose a bet" 😭
How the dumb have risen. Anyone that thinks JJ is dumb they should go watch : Ending it all. Then they will see why JJ has knowledge in his name
KSI wins A LOT...
jj keeps winning lots of money
Crazy that JJ got carried in Who Wants to be a Millionaire and in this one he actually knew the last answer
It’s nice to know Harry has some sort of knowledge on planes🙂
Can anyone explain me the LGBTQ icons joke?
The rich get richer
Harry is elite when it comes to conducting bangers like these, he's just naturally humorous.
Wait KSI really used his K in this vid wtf 🤯
Man Josh should have won atleast smthng
Wait im confused
jj is surprisingly good at these
14:50 lol 25:02 26:08 32:27 43:55 56:23
The plane one I was SCREAMING Tenerife
Neat
who would’ve thought jj and ethan would do better than vik and josh
How have they not done hole in the wall yet 😂
Anyone remember when Ethan said what do cows drink? "Milk', 😂😂
that french border question was a catastrophy
French Guiana*
Always makes a Monday better, especially with bog hosting!!!
The ending was pure satisfaction😂
ANOTHER GOATED VIDEO AND GAME SHOW NEVER DISAPPOINTED WITH THE BOIIIIISSS CONTENT TOP TEIR
1:00:41 I like that they misspelled kangaroo  Also the fact that the two dumbest sidemen won  😂
HA
justice has been served. big up Bez & JJ
Yes more videos like this. Last few months have been horrendous
Tobi With the NO on 18:39LOL
Never drown with remy brown
Harry as the host, already know its going to be a phenomenal video.
Do they actually get to keep the money or do they act that they get it. They are rich enough to pay themselves that money.
Table tennis-zrk fans know
Okay but where can I get that jacket Ethan is wearing???
the ending is funny as hell
Malaysia!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 southeast asia were in europe now i guess 🥵🥵
Vik hard carried
Sidemen just destroying each other's family members
Is that the sidemen doing a remy brown impressions. Never Drown with Remy Brown.
Simon:'What's a tresemme' -- love him
275k won by jj and ethan?
The K in KSI stands for knowledge but it's actually not sarcastic
39:11 was the last sound they wanted to hear on that exact moment
why is sidemen x mrbeast still not a thing
I knew the wombat question immediately
Its so nice to see Ethan and JJ genuinely happy for winning!
harry is the best host now
The music question I was screaming shape of u
A marsupial is an animal with a pouch like a Wombat or a Kangaroo.
Toby really said asia is a country💀
we all know why  vik and josh got difficult question.... becuz they are the brains in the sidemen
16:40 🤣🤣🤣🤣 im dead
Vikk ignoring Josh and going all in on a question was gold, Vikk is a money man fr fr
the goats won
Mr beast needs to do this
Bet that nick avocado thing is gonna make it to drama alert lol
😂 jj
Ngl fellas I think sidemen are dying a bit
32:56 -tommy T has entered the video 😂😂😂
yo im actually loving this vid, first W vid in a long time lets goooo
Sidemen reacts came in clutch
Anyone notice how JJ and Tobi are lowkey matching
The absurdity of Harry is comedy gold
French Guiana and kangaroos will forever stay in my mind
520k views* so early
20:20 Table Dennis!
Ethan and JJ being the smartest, and Vik and Josh being the dumbest...just like everyone predicted
Basketball had over 350 mil registered players in China, Table tennis has under a billion fans and the over 1.5 bil watched the NBA playoffs the year before. Someone need to fact-check them questions before they ask them smh
Hi
I was Choking on my M. Dew 33:00
Screaming Brazil at the screen 🤣
“That’s density” nah vik is too funny mate
Jj always surprise us well played
27:34 out of context is the funniest thing on Earth
The real ones know that the last question is from the what's good podacast
Amazing video ❤
bro i knew about the french border with brazil thanks to side reacts!
What country makes table tennis popular? Toby .... -Asia.   LULW
Steven Hawkings breakfast is quark was an absolute violation. This vid was so funny😂
This video was awesome its that's makes me subscribe
😂😂😂
Tobi ahahahah "This is science or the alphabet"
what an ending!!! The two sdmn not considered to be the smartest with the big W
Should have done Split or Steal at the end for the meme
This was jokes lmaoooo
I haven't screamed "French Guinea" so much in my whole life before I saw Vikk and Josh leave Brazil empty 🤦‍♂️
Another banger in the bag boys!
42:16 he’s actually around 6ft lol
these lot make me feel like a genius, how these lot not know bout french guinea i knew the answer before the choices same with the most streamed spotify song one
Last question threw me so off guard😦
Josh is an idiot, he always wants to be the smart one that's always right. That's what Vik is for Head.
This day will go down in the history books as JJ comes in clutch.
Harry should’ve said French Guinea in the question as it just said French, so they thought France
10:44 Vik with the quick maths
Never drown with Remy brown
this is amazing love the sidemen and all there shows and videos would love to join the team also like the jacket that Ethan has on is available on the site as i cant find it.
the money is actually paid?
Fantastic video good job boys.  It made my day
The French border question is exactly what you’d expect from a Harry question. It makes me love and hate him hosting
Why was the lgbtq question about ethan??
Banger of a vid🚀
Let’s go a banger of a video!
First done video
JJ winning all these game shows is mad 😂
Another banger!
It feels illegal watching a sidemen sunday without eating, Happy Ramadan tho!
I can’t believe josh faked the calorie video my life is a lie now
Table tennis never drown
I'm legit disappointed that Vik and Josh didn't get the French guiana question
😂😂😂 Harry tried so hard for them to drop their monies
Love the vid but annoying every time there is something with money JJ wins it.
Harry’s outfit is always a banger
bez and jj got that clean dap i started watching just for that had that streak going
Great vid yet again. Thanks for the content guys
Can e acknowledge how JJ be looking 🔥 in them glasses 🤓 they make him I love them 😍
this just shows how much they're learning from sidemen reacts
“Wii fat” 💀
8:00 Harry: *Alrighty Then-*
who knew jj and ethan would walk away with the most money
Them adding the 'LGBTQ Icons' category in this is just gold🤣
Harry calls them donuts and he can't even say guyana
jj with glasses <<<3
Okay but Harry is a natural host he should or could seriously get a job doing it and do great at it !!! Nice video lads thanks 😊
How is it that the dumbest pair win the most money??
discount code?
THEY REALLY COULDN'T LOSE 🥲
The production budget has been bumped up yet again
Who would of thought that ethan and jj would beat tobi, Simon, vik and josh lmao
I was screaming french guinea lol
Love these quiz videos
Average sidemen Sunday like them all recently unfortunately :(
FINALLY Jj show he has the K on his name (KSI) the Knowledge 😂🎉🔥
21:51 Yes, It's a marsupial.
KSI for the win again
Australian's out here in disbelief that they don't know what a wombat is 🤣
I didn't expect that pair to win so much money.
We managed to see apart of tommy t nice 😂
Disappointed with this one liked the concept but found audience annoying
32:54 wii FATT 😂😂😂🔥
lmao banger vid
Should have asked Ethan what cows drink.
KSI is money magnet 😂
Didn't footasylum do this. Or did footasylum rip off this gameshow
Finally a question about Nick avocado, and even sidemen knows that he's killing himself and many people have told him to eat to much food. I hope Nick avocado is going to stop eating to much food and realise that he's eating alot of food.
Ksi was actually annoying for once, Simon was as always unbearable bitchy like a little girl and even josh was a a bit jarring. Didn’t like the annoying audience involvement like I’m trying to watch and one of them says something jarring (usually Simon).
Greet video
Looks like Sidemen Reacts is starting to pay off for them 🤣
I remember that plane documentary I was screaming for Tenerife
32:50 TOMMY T
Ethan and JJ winning trivia is a Golden moment!
We need a Beta Squad vs Sidemen Family Feud
Is the money real
Competitive Ethan is the best 😂😂😂
Jaed from nopixel told tommy t this. I also think Harry said it aswell 21:22
JJ can never loose. NEVER
jj instigating everyone then when it's his turn he knew the answers and no one can instigate him
Asking a Vegina question to KSI GG
Who would’ve thought Ethan and JJ would’ve hit new levels of knowledge for that last question? The two hardest questions and they knew the answer to both questions.
19:06 Table.. Taaaable.. table tennis.. TABLE TENNIS
Vik cringe
dicount code? i can't find it   i watched all the video
Damn 500k views in 1 Hour
Lets not show will smith, he is already sensitive
Simon and Tobi's music question was easy though.
1:00:31 the defeat in Harry's face after he cancelled the last question to make it harder LOL, Harry's the king of scuffed gameshows
Ksi was on fireeeeeeee😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shoutout to Sidemen Reacts for basically making the Sidemen trivia Gods 😂😂
Yoooo sidemen are amazing for ever 😄
1:00:09 the karma lmao
Ofcourse jj knows which animal has 3 vaginas🤣
Stormzy dance sent me 😂😂😂😂 fuckin ell
Cheers to my fav channel
JJ knowing the last answer was the icing on the cake. Great video.💯
Please someone help me the , song JJ was singing about the harbour process at around 56:45 , please someone help me find the actual song because I’m trying to study it but I can’t remember it so I think the proper song will help , thankssss
this was a banger
That France question was bs I would have picked the US as well
Dam bro tho is that rlly a mill 😶😶🧐
Josh : Table Tennis  Me: Never drown with Remy Brown
the smartest sidemen all sitting down watching Ethan and jj win all that money was just too good 😂
Harry + PJs = Class ✨
vik isn’t even smart
tobi "what country popularizes that sport...  Asia" 18:47
How did they choose japan ? Like if theres a city name, its the city 😂 theres no "Japan" airport, but surely it's a tenerife one
25:10 tobi saying science or the alphabet 😂😂😂😂
I knew exactly what question Harry was gonna ask in the plane crash one
Nice one .. quality one passed ! Success
i like how they used the same outfit as moresidemen video
W Video
oh another dead  video
1:00:18 one of best moments😂😂😂🤣🤣
Harry hosting is the best thing ever
Video kinda mid
MADNESS
Vik is too smart for these man 😂😂😂
Nice to see Ethan getting a good day. All just to gas him up before the next holiday
JJ is the smartest Sidemen :)
Another W for Nigerians let's go
6:04 says Shape of Me
I swear when he said quantum physics I was expecting some Einstein question but it was so easy quarks are legit just fundemental particles that make protons and are part of the group called preons with strange left right up down quarks I think there was 1 more
Very very unfair to Josh and Vik.   Quantum physics and French territory vs Food and milk.   There is a biased man behind these questions who needs to be fired. For that reason, I will dislike this video and the next one too.
why are there moaning sounds at random intervals in the video
Banger vid, its been so long since I watched it that I forgot that the drop was a gameshow but it was really fun to watch.
Ethan and JJ were on something for this video. These man were way too hyped.
YewwwwwCheeeeewwberrrrr
The last thing I expect was JJ to start a Chemistry rap!
Holy fk that amount of money can turn around anyone's life unless u r rich enough .
Taaayyyble tennis - Remy Brown… iykyk
how is posible that our fatneek still winning
Harry's the GOAT🐐
ethan and jj slumpdog millionaired the last question damn
The sidemen always have such bangers
WII FAT LMAO
Lets go, classic low budgetish sidemen banter
What a banger banger of a video this is!!
Ksi is my guy
Never expected ksi and Ethan to win ngl 😭
Ethan and JJ were awesome at this. They were the team I thought that would get nothing 😂😂😂 big ups to them 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Harry being the host is something I didn’t know I needed. Big up the personality 😂🙏
It's French Guyana, not French Guinea
Just was 50 secs but this going to be a banger
Harry gave such a massive hint with the airplanes having to be averted to another airport. Only close airport would be one of the other islands
Harry vids r too good
French Guinea is in west Africa so presume they mean French Guiana
Great vid. Jj and Ethan are hilarious
mad lads
anyone wanna explain the connection between lgbtq icons and ethan's favorite games? I didn't get the joke
W VIDEO
Did JJ and Tobi plan their outfits
Um French Ginea isnt a thing anymore and isnt a territory of france anymore
That was sick
HARRY AND HIS PYJAMAS
The ending was a banger, harry's face of pure disappointment
How in the heck did that happen lmao 🤣🤣
40:00
Never drown, Remy Brown (table tennis) 😢
Ethan and JJ the goats
This show was elite
Harry is the most scuffed host of these game shows but he's also the best NGL
Footasylum did it first
Today is my birthday and sidemen sunday made it better❤💯
Never drown with remey brown
25:16 Tobi “Man said Science or the alphabet” had me dead💀
That poo discussion was not expected as i was eating…😂🤣🤣🤣
The whole segment of the LGBTQ Icons absolutely killed me. Haven’t laughed this much out loud in a long time.
32:20 oh dear harry 🤣🤣🤣
Absolute banger of a vid
‘Tayyyble tennis’ - remy brown
French Guiana ! NOT French Guinea!
This isn't entertaining....un subbing
Another great sidemen Sunday 😁
Harry Need's to host more sidemen Sunday's
Ethan come to Harry with jokes on his mom, but he got the last laugh with the LGBTQ+ Icons question 😂
This is good. Amazing even. But I can’t stop thinking abt how much better it would be if Stephen tries hosted it
French Guinea isn’t a place. Its called French Guiana.
Very good video I like it so much but they should have put josh with either jj or Ethan and vikk with the other that would have been better
I haven't had this much fun in a long time
Secure the bag sidemen edition
The back to back "I Know This" Was insane
Bog hosting is the best thing in this video
One of the best endings to a sidemen video, Ethan and JJ as a team are unmatched
Hold on a minute I recognise the background? 🤔
To break my fast every Sunday to this for a month 🔥🔥🔥
Yes good idea ! Crap studio but good idea 😂
JJ screaming "I know this"🤣
Bro Vik just silently stacking the money om Havanese ignoring literally everything else is the vibe we need to catchhh
took me bare long to realise that the screen behind them wasn't actually showing the categories irl
Harry messed up 😂
the lgbt ethan bit was too funny  reminded me of the old jokes
“Kangeroo”
yeh another one ♥
nice vid but we NEED another one like the library and make paint ball shooting and nice stuff like that
OK BUT KSI HAS KNOWLEDGE FOR REALLLLL
i'm from French Guiana , the french territory bordering Brazil and not French guinea, because that's in Africa. So as always Harry needs help
Josh was goated in this video
Man included Ethan in the the icons question😂😂😂😂😂😂
ok
Harry changing the final question because because Ethan knew the answer - if he wanted guesses all along there were quite a few other questions someone knew the answer...
JJ and Ethan went 5Head
JJ and Ethan make the best duo
13:54 the havent watched Breaking Bad
It is a marsupial
Josh is an L, not triggering in every video
Indians deciding whether to watch the video or go to sleep. I k what I'm doing.
Harry is the best host
31:22 I SPAT MY DRINK ALL OVER MY FLOOR SO HARD ROFLMAO
hi
Siiiiick video man
BOGGOS TROUSERS 👌🏻🤣
Ethan and jj is such an underrated duo, love these two together
27:42 tobi moving mad
The chemistry bewteen Ethan and JJ 👌🏾
vik and josh got robbed tbf
7 of them together just feels right, OT7 are honestly the best Sidemen Sundays
NFSU2 is a banger of a video game.
Marking my 37th streak of watching sidemen Sunday within 1 hour of upload
this was too funny, found myself laughing the whole way through
Vik 🔥🔥🔥
gg🔥
what are wombats ☹️, ogs in Australia
Vikk does get annoying when he thinks he knows everything.
It was mad tense when Vik went in everytime. Absolutely smashed it. <3
By far the best sidemen Sunday of the year so far (in my opinion)
It’s French Guyana , the capital is Georgetown
4:45 Shape of me?
Cancel the question had me dead😭😭
I can’t believe JJ and Ethan know kangaroos have the vaginas. Weird fact to know
A kangaroo has three vaginas... a fact I'll never forget after this.
32:55 absolute murder from Josh there
The boys did Vik and Josh dirty in this one
So this explains why Harry was in a suit in calfreezys video giving Ksi his prime car
The two smart Sidemen forgetting French Guyana and Harry mistaking Guinea for Guyana is not a great look lmao
I would like to say its French Guiana that borders Brazil not French Guinea which was a French colony in Africa
the sunny stuff always remain here  sick vid
I googled French Guinea and it was in Africa so I don’t get what Harry is talking about
Best video of the year so far
All the team's were wearing matching shoes
Cannot believe JJ actually remembers stuff from SidemenReacts.😂
How come the richest always become richer!
What a BANGINNN VIDEO😆😆,  lets go ethan and jj😆😆
SIDEMEN SUNDAY : DEAL OR NO DEAL
55:51 when josh asked which is it every inch of my brain said harry is gonna say well idk lads Ethans dad never brought it back yet
The ending was the best part, Harry was trying so hard to keep JJ and Ethan from winning so easily.
travis scott needs to drop UTOPIA!
Jj being so happy after getting that politics question right was so precious and then the happiness after having tonput all his fate in ethan's hands
i was screaming when josh put malaysia has the largest french border
I cant believe josh and vik actually considered monaco and usa
felt bad for vik and josh but damn if that chaos around the geography question wasn't hilarious
Someone, anyone, please tell me why ETHAN picks his nose in just about every video??? 🤣🤣
Vik made a ray j joke LMAO
Ethan and JJ at the end was so elite it was so funny
Going into this video i did NOT expect this outcome 😂
Footyasylum vs Sidemen lmao
Honestly, one of the best sidemen sunday videos imo
The last answer of every question is known by someone 🤣 last time it was josh and now ethan and JJ 🤣
Harry with two Ls at the end there 🤣
JJ and Ethan with a W love to see it
can somebody fill me in with the table tennis accent joke??
Bermondsey spelt burmonsey
31:22 I SPILLED MY DRINK OUT OF MY MOUTH SO HARD ROFLMAO
I definitely enjoyed this
What the hell is French guinea?
That geography question with France lmaoo...how did they miss that, especially Vikk and Josh
Harry being the host is one of the best parts of this game 😂
Game show sidemen Sundays are my favorite
Got too excited for sidemen sunday :)
41:36 what’s that box around for? For framing the scene?
Imagine will smith turning up out of no where and slaps u all 😂🤣
This is the 1st time seeing JJ using K(Knowledge)in one of sdmn videos 🤣🤣 and the last 2 questions had me rolling 🤣🤣 and their reaction was priceless 🤣🤣
39:19 Harry meant French Guyana, French Guinea was the colonial name of what we now call Guinea, I think
Perfect YouTube channel ❤️
do they really get the money plz be honest prob not right lmao
I think JJ and Ethan are the best dou out of sidemen thus far
Harry wearing the same trousers from pervious MoreSidemen videos.
That's the happy ending i need 😂
Hahaha Ethan and JJ chemistry in this video is out of this world man
Harry : two planes crashes into each other  Vik : “WoW”
I remember Harry saving that last jj and Ethan question from what’s good podcast
Harry's vids aree ddddiifff i had so much fun watching this vid i can't believe what happened with vik-josh and how awesome was ethane and jj round 😭😭
Wii fat 😂😂🤣🤣
Poetic that the dumbest ones got the most money and the smartest got none.
JJ and Ethan GOT cheated with the final question !!!
Tobi & Simon : Confuse Vik & Josh : Confident JJ & Ethan : Mad
What a BANGER
20:40 lmao 🤣🤣
39:20 It’s French Guiana not French Guinea
Goated group ever🔥🔥
Me who watches plane crash documentaries too. Hehehe
just watched the crossbar challenge again!!
this was fun
54:04 jj had never been prouder of ethan lol
france border question was easy as hell, disappointed vik didn’t know that
Here 💪🏼
Who doesn’t just love it when harry host’s a sidemen game show ?
JJ put so much pressure on Josh and Vik lmao
Me, and intelect, laughing cuz ik that this was where the filmed the sidemen slap game
JJ making full use of his name in this video: Knowledge- s i . . okaayy then 😂
20:43 damn it, they cut out what JJ was laughing at
I know thissssssss
JJ PROVED THE K
I'm so glad for once that the currency is Pounds rather than Dollars
Wii fat was such a killer joke
Josh and Vik were jokes in this vid. The LGBTQ question is amazing.
Love this vid to bits
i  can not believe ethan just called simon,s mum an Animal infront of simon,s face
brooo i need tinder viddsssss
What a fun game!
Is Josh’s vest for sale somewhere!? Does anyone know!? I saw XIX on it....
JJ always finds a way to win this money videos😂😂😂
not a fan of the set. looks dated
Watching JJ & Behz win was wholesome 🤣🤣
Knowledge in ksi proved to be correct 😎💯
Sick, very sick. W2S as host is goated
Eyo i'm to baked for this 😂🤩
2.1k to comment let’s go
that ending was legendary
Glad to see all the Sidemen back in a video together!
Boring
Banger! Lol. JJ clutch! He did a madness on Behz with the politics question though. 🤣🤣🤣  Also, lol at the misspelling of Kangaroo on the answer screen at the end. There is no e in Kangaroo.
Now I know why Harry was dressed the way he was on Freezy’s video😂
josh and viks options were clearly so much harder than the rest
Man the ending was amazing
W video
NO JOKES THIS WAS Basically the sidemen getting some anger out and insulting each other but it work for me couldn’t stop laughing
Underrated vid😂
Yeah who’s the smartest??😂😂 big up jj and Ethan!!!
Miniminter is a LGBTQ Icon.
I have to say this could be my favourite game show video yet
Already finished it lads I clicked on it within 50 seconds
Harry is the best Host
I’m here only to remind Josh that he knew that wombat question because of someone in GTA RP lmao
dont let tobi and simon be on the same team anymore they take way to long
french guinea😭😭 isnt it french guyana??
32:33 im cryinggggg
This just proves what a good friend Vikk is. He listens and remembers.
i love sundays
How do they not know French Guyana man, my brain is hurting so much😂
30:04 the confidence that we hope to get
Simon and Tobis first three questions were all easy af
Ethan moving like some Mr Tumbles
Only good part of sunday
Harry is the man!!!!!!!!!!
30:04 the confidence in this man is unbelievable
I take it this was recorded before the Oscars and what are the chances it has 2 questions relating to the incident: Jada bald head and Gi. Joe deadi
Tobi -  " so science, or the alphabet." me - dies laughing🤣
Can I hold like 10g really quick $Y11K
Need for speed underground 2 was elite, still to this day one of my top 5 ever played games
Tobi: 18:50 “what country popularisers that sport?….Asia”   Me: 😐😑🤦‍♀️ oh Tobi
This is juts locked in on sidemen
Why did I think that Ethan and JJ were going to win
If we lose I'm used to it. I'm a united fan too 🥲🥲😭 Tobi with another iconic quote. And lmfao I rate that claps from the sidemen when Tobi said it 👏😭
JJ and Harry hosting is the best 😂😂 JJ characters and Harry’s jokes and weird side lol
37:06 Bog has done the sign again
NFS underground 2. respect Ethan lad
The LGBTQ Icons question was on another level
I wanted to know why harry wore suit when I saw him on Cals Prime car video.. Now I know XD
‘It’s going to be about my mother I bet’ 😂😂😂
Secure the bag?
This is awesome guys alus topping yourself each week
Josh knows about the Wombat poo because of Tommy T 😂
Finally all 7 sidemen in 1 vid!!! Made my evening😌
Applesauce with barbeq
Harry is definetly watching Mentor Pilot for those aviation accidents 😄
Let Harry do this more often, this is hilarious
Actually made my birthday. So jokes
38:37 why are they slapping the poor chair lmao
Bro i knew the plane crash one from breaking bad innit
20:00
In the new 2022 THE BATMAN, the first scene really set the tone for how dark the film would play out.  I felt a similar way during this after Harry’s first question was asked 😂😂😂
Tobi and Simon got robbed
Hi
love the editing at 41:35
bro i literally recommended this vid :)))) im so happy they went with it
39:20 guinea is in africa. French guiana is pronounced gee-aa-nah
i miss the old sidemen when they would just do normal challenges and stuff.. this aint entertaining anymore... never thought i could say that
LGBTQ Icons Also Harry: SO these games....lmfao
Harry looking more and more like Boris Johnson everyday
hi
TAAABLE TENNIS, NEVER DROWN WITH REMY BROWN
Table tennis🤣🤣 IYKYK, FREE REMY!!✊
FUNNY VIDEO
Anyone else think Josh lowkey sounded a bit Tommy T in this video?? in a good way ofc but i felt like Tommy T was playing with vikk 😂😂
I still don't understand the French border question 😶🙁
Imagine if Will actually came to UK and slap whoever got the wrong answer in question 1.
I love these videos especially with Harry as a host
Josh and Vik’s go was jokes
These vids would actually be so much better if they just got a sponsor and there was actually money at steak. But it’s pretty obvious that these guys don’t get their winnings.   Sure they’re all making huge money- but videos like this are just fake
JJ's wearing glasses, he's finally earned that K
Fun fact: Juice WRLDS lucid dreams has surpassed gods plan in streams on Spotify
P
Funny how harry looks so smart now😂
As an South American I was screaming Brazil through the screen lool because I know brazil is near french Guiana 😂😂..@39:04
Vikk was kinda on fire tbh
MFW game show 😐
My real question is "Do they REALLLY get the money after?"
Vik & Josh were the best team the confidence is great especially with Harry's trolling
Who’s LGBTQ and when did he get an Icon
Vik 💀😂
French Guinea lol It's French Guiana
Am I wrong, or is it French Guyana not French Guinea?
I have a question what has a boiling point of 60 because i instantly said 60
Harry is the most btec quizshowhost its so fun
Havanese are great dogs!
I thought nick avocado was skinnier now
07 table tennis go MDM
I can feel tobi i am a united fan too ❣️💔
Josh dropping the remy brown table tennis
Ofc ksi knew the last question
Gotta love when Sidemen upload
JJ's comment about that YouTuber being big is not making me feel comfortable going to his sold out tour next month.. 🧐
Love this video 😆
‘It was Wii Fat bro’  Killed me off
shape of me?
Tobi drinking juice out of the carton is so funny idk y
45:00
Never drown with Remy Brown
“And Simon’s mother is an animal.” DAMN ETHAN LMAO
Vik just needs to shut up. Man can't keep quiet for a sec
Sidemen vidios dont got cringe an are still funny
Best thing to watch while iftaring, laughing and enjoying my meal, keep it up guys
I think Ksi knows a lot about planecrashes because a lot of them land on his forhead.
Siuuuu
the game was rigged against Josh and Vik, especially the French border question lol
Ayyo I’m early
Quality episode!!!!
sidemen is covering every show and I love it!
ahhh gaming and some sidemen on the side
Will Smith has arrived in Guernsey 🤣🤣🤣
Harry is the best host
Someone at Google is very confused at the sudden large amount of google searches for Wombat poo shape.
Since when did JJ need glasses?
Anyone else here from that sidemen TikTok
what happened to ethan’s face ?
josh calling Ethan "Wii fat" killed me🤣🤣🤣
"Didn't ask" Haha
Banger!
Never drown with Remy Brown. JJ and Josh keeping the spirit alive 🙌
Sidemen Sunday after the 7 am shift hits different

Cherry Barry
As soon I see Harry with a suit, I knew this was gonna be a banger
Ethans favorite game of all time is "We fap bro"
Yooo
Where did Harry get the numbers for the question at 20:00 ? Because pretty much every website stated the top three sports as Football, Cricket then Basketball
39:21 Bruh that's in Africa, I think he meant French Guiana lmao
i love harry so much as a host
Harry was so confident it was French Guinea, I feel bad, it's French Guiana and I found it funny how much the guys struggled! 🤣
"It's the W2S family, they don't make sense"
Btw It’s French Guiana not french Guinea
Am I the only one that is curious why Ethan and his favorite game was under LGBTQ Icons category???😅
28:25 shoutout tho whichever camera man zoomed in on the single stack of $25k randomly LOL
why is the video only 50 fps
Great Video, like always!
Harry hosting it alone makes this a banger
Is it just me or does Vik look like Agent Stone from Sonic
I'm I the only one googling the answers before they actually answer?😂
the conversation about poo is peak sidemen
Tell travis scott he needs to drop utopia
early
Anyone else die laughing at wii fat
They rich asf
19:52 violation💀
no one at this point in time had seen the full video
17:43 wtf is that face tobi
How does Simon not know where Tenerife is lol
Vik says out of America how many people play BB : I live in the north east of the UK and in my school alone there is 90.
Poor josh and vik
What is the discount code
josh slaying in his fit
Bro the ending made me die when harry said cancel the question then the next when they also knew cz it was on sidemen reacts best video ever man luv u guys
20:45 roller coaster of emotions
french guyana! not guinea haha
the fact he’s wearing a suit and then pj bottoms below 😂😂😂 bogs on his own level
I like jj’s new glasses!
Why did i know the plane crash answer
Yo jj looks peng in glasses
tobi: "is it science or the alphabet" 25:17
Your mom
I’d be fuming if I were josh
hhahah we all know who aint splitting
"Wii Fat" 🤣
Gods of gameshows
Another banger video from the lads👏👏
:)))
the sidemen have no ideas so they now have to copy tv shows
Josh and Vik don't know about French Guyana ? They dumber than Ethan.
Only the ones who knows about Harry’s first hosting video can like this!:)😂😂😂
Vikk looks so much more comfortable to joke around recently, it’s really nice!
TOBI, COUNTRY, ASIA!!!
Always makes a Sunday better, especially with Bog hosting!!!
Just clicked on the video, i already know it's going to be fire
Do a sidemen higher or lower with money.
This like secure the bag in Footasylum
The Sidemen are the perfect guys to watch while eating
Ethan being the LGBTQ+ Icon question took me out
11:46 - breaking bad refrence!
This is pretty sick, haven't watched this show in YEARS so glad to see the Sidemen covering it!
Vik: It’s a marsupial   Simon: ______
🔥🔥😭😅
W video.
I wish josh and Viks go lasted a bit longer they were so jokes
Of course the dog from Cuba gravitated to the line snorting stoner
Nfsu2 is the best game ever
Am I the only one that realised Harry and Ethan hate Simon ☠️😂😂😂
🤌🤌🤌❤️
So this is what the background is for from the more sideman vids 🤣
Harry just can't be bothered to change out of his pj pants and honestly, same
Been waiting for this all day cmon
19:55 didn't ask 20:46 mum is an animal 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
French Guinee is in Africa, it's supposed to be French Guiana lmao
Josh got told about the square poo from GTA Tommy T.
4:55 Shape of me lmao.
God I love a sidemen game show
😂😂😂😂
Harry hosting a show is best
Best videos to watch while eating no cap
Thanks to the sidemen my search history is now full of wombats pooping 😂
Vik just ignoring Josh
Why they copying Teddy Fresh hoodie?
harry lost some pounds
Vik really questioned if many people outside America watch basketball.... Im dead.
19:55
Nice
It's French Guiana, not Guinea
Tbf I rate jjs reaction and shows he does remember some reacts stuff 😆
Vik carried Josh  Edit: Lol
French border question was so dumb  😂
It would have been nice to have had a constant visual of the answers on screen whilst they are discussing the answers. Nice video though :)
32:21 😂😂😂😂
24:30
Let's see how much bot comments I can get since sidemen comments is only bots
Sidemen never disappoint  Love from 🇿🇦
harries sundays are always the best!
man i could have had almost £3mil ¬.¬
emon>KSIMON
Cant be the only one that realised the editor spelt Bermondsey wrong
Harry is a 🐐 host
Good job with this one guys
BANGER
Is it weird I knew the plane crash one?
Vik using words like Marsupial and everyone being blank about it is such an old-school sidemen vibe!
Josh’s face as he said “Wii fat, bro.” 😂😂😂
They filmed 3 videos in the same day and kept the good vibes respect 👍🏼
The sidemen dont stop producing bangers
They all finally together
I actual new the French border question and sorry for my other comments just banting about
Finally a banger
I loved this show!!
Overproduced crap as helll
32:51 THAT IS A VIOLATION 😂💀
My Sunday just went 📈
Josh paniking when Vik going all in on Havanese was jokes lol
58:10 this is the best ending one could ask for
That dog question,  vik was sickkk
The first question is beyond cringe. Love the Sidemen but for real.  She’s NOT bald because of it.  It was her choice.
These vids are always one of the best things in a week but its MAD how they are so chill with that much money in the room with them. I would have a heart attack xD
this video was actually jokes🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
10:18 only time, Man utd did not let down its supporters in the past decade ❤
If anyone was wondering, josh knew wombats poo is cubed because someone told him in gta rp. Think it was Marie
And Simon's mother is an animal! Hahahaha had me howling!
actually milk boils at 95 degrees
32:50 Oh god, josh man😂
Tobi: “I don’t think terror when I think Japan”   WW2 Japan: 🙂
First!
Harry is so much like boris johnson
JJ in his glasses is doing something to me. Man looking fire.
Man like KSI looks like he's about to do numbers in the library 😂
DO TASKMASTER!
Don't know why, but I love this set with the red wall 😂
Harry being super into the history of plane crashes is so harry
17:55 wtf is that background noice lmao
Wii fat that sent me 😂😂😂
no way has JJ watched drag race hahah Queeen
"and simons mother is an animal "  simon:    :)
I’m still confused on why lgbtq went to Ethan’s fav video game 🤣
Anyone else know the plane crash answer from breaking bad (Tenerife question)
28:12 ayo??
Ethan being called a LGBTQ+ icon has me rolling 😂
Cancer of the head….. uhuh
Tobi, Man city will win the league, hold that 😆😆😆😆😝
"Wii fat" too funny 😂😭🤣
20:43
19:20 never drown with remy brown
Pen
Simons didn't ask was cold
harry's DRIP>
My whole school got warned for graffiti and vandalism because I was writing the word “noice” on desks and walls so now   bruh
The fact that they chosed Quantum physics instead of LGBTQ icons... just proves how silly this generation is.
@10:32 i love how they turned to vik when they needed help on the maths/stochastics haha
6/10
When I saw Harry dressed like this in freezys latest video I wondered what they were up to.
Wow
I love harry bro
Harry is the best host.....no competition
Simon: What’s is a wombat? Harry: Some sort of bat
shape of me
just seen comments say nice vid after the video hasn't even dropped 15min🤣🤣
No adds, I aint complaining but someone is gettin fired 😂
Glad everyone’s here today
Bro Harry's got an amazing sense of humor. 😅💖💖
The fact Harry was wearing a suit on the top and pj’s on the bottom😂😂😂
Harry Has the same suit he wore in Cal Freezy’s video “surprising ksi with a prime car.!
Wii fat 😭😭😭
Earl brooo
i can’t believe that for the past 8 years i’ve been watching 7 normal guys just having fun as entertainment it’s so elite
can’t lie sidemen Sunday videos really going down in entertainment quality recently
Google searches for wombat poo after watching this video: 📈📈📈
We already knew about them wearing these clothes, cuz they were wearing them in da moresidemen vid
man i love sidemen sundays
I never watch these lot anymore cause I’m not 14 but had to click on this icl
Don’t read my name
Sidemen making our Sunday's better as usual
never drown remy “table tennis” brown
I love how Harry is wearing a coat with checkered pants
1.7k
Finally seeing where they filmed all those more sidemen videos lol
First the Who wants to be a millionaire video and now this one Looks like only Harry is worthy of hosting 1 Million Pound Videos.
They ain't doing it for anything though just another crap show to gain money. Ridiculous
The way Harry's hands flopped over when he said "it was real foggy" 😂
Harry's answers are the best lmao
"how is life" bog tings
That stare tho 20:44
1
32:55 Josh what a roast😂😂😂
12:50 Simon looked if one of the countries was in the middle east, right as harry said " terrorist " lmao
I would love to see a sidemen TaskMaster. How good would that be??
The spoon your mother question had me dying🤣 I would choose Vik ofcourse!
here before 235k  views
Simon VS Ethan roast one another 😂
‘Quantum physics or the alphabet’ -Tobi😂😂
another stinker lets go
20:40 ahh what was cut out 😭
cannot wait too watch this
Not bog getting confused between French Guinea (which no longer exists) and French Guiana, which does. The answer was correct, his pronunciation very much was not
25:04 "Science or the alphabet"   💀
let’s go sidmen
In the famous words of Vic “To be fair…
18:30 Tayyyble tennis! Never drown with Remy Brown!
Lol only Harry hosts the million pound videos.
Ethan's laugh
Jesus is our saviour ✝️
i like how the questions were actually funny and not dead
Taableee Tenniss - Never Drown …..
25:00
«Wii fat» -Josh 2022- RIP - Ethan Payne
This is so damn good  I really enjoyed this one .👏

Imma be the first view
"I love this channel, brighten's up my day always!"- Every focken verified spammer
Pov: ur eating
Noice

shush
The best part of my Sunday
Love how after they mention harry mother jj put his hand in his pant at 8:07
why is jj wearing glasses. he looks too smart
Cheers to my bhailog from India
finally a banger !!
Sunday just got better!
25:00 Only Harry could do this
PERFECT TO BREAK FAST IN RAMADAN 😁
Josh should've shouted out my guy Remy with the tayyyyble tennnnis
What a drop!!!
4:47 Shape of me?? 😂
What a banger of a video this Sunday
Thank god harry was host today ! Hes always a funny host
26:28 Stephen Hawkings favourite breakfast😂😂
The sidemen have fell off
Why does josh think he’s bad
Another Banger from these guys 🔥
Does anyone know where to get Ethan's jacket from? I can't find it on sidemen clothing
Tobi was wrong for, “It’s science or the alphabet.”
Ethan back at it again with the animal and Simon’s mom references
How does harry make everything he says 100x funnier... pure talent.
Aaahhhh now I get why Zerkaa just randomly bought up the most streamed song on Spotify on one of his streams
some buzz when Harry is the host 😂
Or get the lads too go visit Royal Marines for Few days
None of those were why Jada was bald, she was bald because she shaved it. She just happens to have alopecia
Harry in a suit is basically young Boris Johnson.
Does anyone know if the sidemen actually get the money they win?
Nice to see harry hosting it’s been a while
Or side men through the wall
POG!
Sidemen ninja worrier would be sick
Knock knock
Anyone else remember the plane crash was Tenerife from Breaking Bad Season 3
19:07 JJ just saying table
good
Not Harry thinking a wombat is a bat 😭
Tobi being the “nice one” and snapping at josh a few minutes later
I knew the plane crash one
Bogger is one of the best host in his own ways.... The best one and truly the funniest sidemen
Tobi seems so out of touch with himself compared to the others, over the years they all had to find themselves and look within, all except tobi, mangaged to do that
Love Harry everytime when he is the host 😂👌
just loved the consolation at 19:55 of simon to ethan 👀 wholesome moment💕
KSI with glasses lookin nice
This is pretty sick, haven't watched this show in YEARS so glad to see the Sidemen covering it!
When i saw harry hosting i already knew this was gonna be good
What did ethan say that made jj laugh so much 20:43
Vik lookin hella golden today
Awesome Sunday video sideman
Before 1 million views
1 HOUR SIDEMEN VIDEOOOOOOOO LESSGOOOOO

This makes me alot better after watching the liverpool vs man city game
Harry is my most fav host.... Dude can make a normal sentence funny
The Sidemen are the perfect guys to watch while eating
It wasn’t table tennis
Wombat poo about to trend on google.
its like someone forced JJ to be there.. he looks so done w everyone lol
Simon "god wouldn't let that happen" minter
hi love u guys
Josh with the tAble tennis reference Never drown with Remi Brown!!
its crazy how they are willing to give themselves a million but only are willing to give back to their fans a few grand
1:59 new meme template descovery
tobi has the soul of an old white man
Simon and Tobi's duo is underrated.   P.S. Also they were just Firing Shots lol 😂😂.
Time of iftar + watching sidemen, life is beautiful❤
Lacking the dramatic background music
Poor Ethan
y is JJ ticking
I like JJ in glasses!
So heres a sidemen video Idea: Each of the sidemen faces one of their greatest fears like for eg For jj he will be in a room with bugs. And each sidemen will have to face one fear. I think that video would bang.
tobi lookin like a snack
Love a bit of sideman Sunday
Banger vid
Idk but I am super happy seeing all the 7 together with Harry as host
W2S: *"I didn't come up with these questions"*  Also W2S: "What team does W2S's little brother support?"🤣
JJ with them glasses tho 👀😏
totally not footasylum inspired
anyone know what happened to Josh left eye/side of head
For Moresidemen pls do Tier List videos
Nobody has watched this video in full yet 😏
"Does she have cancer of the head"  Classic harry
Early gang tap in
Saw Harry on Cals channel with a half suit on...was wondering why...now i know 😂😂
So this is where they been filming these short videos
sidemen-  one million pound drop  me- one rupee drop with the boys
The Sideman are just a beautiful combo of smart stupid and funny
The sidemen stay winning
It's good to see another game show like sidemen Sunday
Every Sunday I am so excited for the sidemen Sunday and they never let me down!
Boggo hosting this bouta be a good one
Oh no, very sad there aren't subtitles for this video 😢
excited for this video
Sidemen Sunday!!!
14:22 lmao JJ gets ignored saying something, actually smart
Gotta love a Harry hosting
Harry is hilarious as a host
Iftar and watching this is elite 10/10
Ayo shape of me be hittin different tho
Sidemen sundays = another legendary video these guys are just on a different level to anyone else!
The moment harry brought up the plane crash question I already knew the answer before he brought up the answers
SIDEMEN SUNDAY, THE BEST F*#CKING DAY!
U gotta love a Harry game show 😂
Vikstar has little man syndrome
18:06 what is going on with Jj lmao 😂
Yes sirrrski 🔥
Only Harry would have a category in these based on plane chrashes😂😂

One of the best in a long time boys, ngl
Thought I saw target ad when the video started
We need more sidemen videos presented by Stephen tries, that man's charisma and energy just make these type of videos which are already top tier even better. Please give that man some work.
Harry looking fly
I love these type of gameshow videos!
Mateee so happy to see a bit harder physics question for the bois

Hi
No one Harry : Watches plane crashes videos with a smile on his face.😭😭💀🔥🔥🔥
NOW WE’RE TALKING💪💪
I’m glad Harry is the host of the game, but amazing vid btw.
they have been making a lot of vids in this place
** Hour long video uploads 5 minutes ago **  People: oh, it's an absolute banger!
Bog is just goated
“I’m a man utd fan too, im used to losing.” The unfortunate truth from tobi😭
Hopefully they do another one of these
harry’s gameshows 💯
I love when Harry hosts the game show. He's just so funny
love a scuffed Harry gameshow, the best of the best
Let’s go boys! What a show
Hi
8:05  Ethan: spreadable Simon: or Harry's mother💀💀
Haven't seen this show in years
Fatneek with the Deji glasses lmao
"If we lose I'm used to it I'm a United Fan"- Tobi
GI Jane 2 can't wait to see it

This is the day cal made KSI the prime car
Sidemen are doing all the best TV shows!
10 minutes ago 🤩
FINALLY ANOTHER GAME SHOW!!
yo
It always brightens up a Sunday, especially when Bog is hosting.
I now know why josh asked this on his stream
Like how they ask Vik for verification of their Math xD
Only 1080p u mad?
Harry might actually be the best gameshow host, his answers and awkwardness are just bants  Especially in pyjama bottoms
"How's your life" LMAO Harry's too funny
All day i been telling myself its sidemen Sunday tomorrow i was so confused why they posted today lmao
sidemen are too big time first 1...hundred thousand 🤣
Shape of Me   Harry is just a frickin Legends
Sidemen sunday is even better when bog is hosting 😂
eIgHtY-eIgHt tHoUsAnDtH
haven't watched sidemen in days fam and as i come back i see jj wearing glasses 🤓
mmm money
Sidemen don’t miss ever.
YES
WELCOME TO SIDEMEN SUNDAY!!! Today, kindof like last week, were giving a multi millionaire another million dollars! While our ordinary fans watch us get even richer!  Lol seriously,  why not change someone's life every week instead of making sure some of the richest people on YouTube go from having 9mil in the bank to 10mil? It makes it hard to enjoy. Take the $ out, or give it to people who need it.
Everyone has a beard except for KSI 🤣
Always save your hunger til the new sidemen sunday drops
I swear Footasylum did something similar to this
Harry has to be one of the funniest guys alive  never fails to make me laugh
Love it
Nothing can make your Sundays more better than Sidemen Sundays🔥
Harry hosting is always going to be jokes 🔥
Harry's hosting is one of my favorite things
Yo why is JJ wearing glasses lately?
I remember the boys when they each had less than like 50k subs. Time flies
Just the vid I needed to cure my boring Sunday
Finally ❤️
We can all agree a Sidemen Sunday makes our Sunday 100x better.
the sidemen are the perfect channel
What a channel, huge help for my mental health, Legends!
Anyone else notice that it said ‘shape of me’ when they dropped😭
What a banger of an episode
Good vid
Hi I’m here
Finally the greatest thing came🔥
lezzz goooooo
ayyyyyyyy
Tinder part 4?
i waited 7 days for this
yes i always love the game shows
Harry has the best dressing sense 😂😂😂 And he is the best host also.....
Do they get to keep the money? I know the answer is not but they were puting enough attention in it
Imagine losing 3 quarters of a million not knowing the most streamed song on spotify
Shout out to footaslym for this idea
bro when are they going to do one with PewDiePie and jacksepticeye
Bog hosting = BANGER
Just realized this is the same background as the last two MoreSidemen games. It all adds up now. Also, one-hour upload! 🙌
sidemen sundays are the best.
Bring back the OG sidemen videos please!!! and football
New Sidemen studio lookin fire 🔥
Its nice to see KSI back in the Sidemen Sundays
Is there going to be will smith joke?
Only sidemen true fans know that this is the same set of last 2 Moresidemen videos..... 😂😂

The answers tho, cheers Harry🤣
Harry shows are the best

4:45 shape of me? lmao
Perfect timing, I needed to waste an hour while I wait for NBA finale Sunday

Sundays always better with the Sidemen.
HARRY IS THE BEST GAME HOST THERE COULD EVER BE
Footasylum inspired
Sidemen are the best they make my Sunday besttt
This is the only reason I'm glad it's Sunday

Amazing Sunday
SIDEMEN ❤️
Wooo
Best when the sidemen are all together for a video!
Harry as a host is always a guaranteed banger!
I love shape of me
Now we know why Harry was dressed up from the waist up in Cal's vid
Like genuinely is this the first time Knowledge has wore glasses without playing another character?
To sidemen editor: please add subtitles which can be enabled from tapping on cc

Hello
Worth the wait tbh
Harry’s hosting skills combined with his natural, awkward brand of humour is amazing
Harry

Another banger boys!

Before I start the video, Ethan is definitely gonna say something stupid...I mean the video is an hour long, so maybe that's not a good prediction, okay...I predict that Ethan will go into the double digits with stupid things he will say.
