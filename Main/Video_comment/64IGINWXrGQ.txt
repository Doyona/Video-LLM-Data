I'm 24, & i started music when I was 17. I've been listening to Polo ever since I was 18, the way he   Switched from hard drill to melodic rap inspired me to go hard with music being from the same place as him. He's the greatest musician to ever live and I pray one day to have a fraction of the success that he has

Man as much as I like to blame other, I know most of this shit is on me. Thank you for staying real polo, when juice passed I thought I lost the only real artist. But you even said in that interview, that’s one thing he taught you, and it shows.

this one here >>  You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my nigga's gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Ain't for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song fireeee!!!

Lyrics Dmac on the fucking track Tahj Money I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag, now I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they're goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic' I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad goin', bitch, we don't do no assist Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light, tryna load his blick Everyday a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you're down to see the coldest shit I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze Switchers on them glaciers, get to blowin' like it's for me Promise to my son, that the street won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on them, but they forcin' me See him in person, and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in the van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my nigga's gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Ain't for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

Whoever disliked this should get Covid test cause one of the main symptoms is no taste.
Almost 100 m’s
"Once you give my pussy up, it's over with,  miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with"  That hit different right there
I think the music video tells a completely different story then the lyrics. I like the lyrics better
𝓼𝓲.......𝔀𝓱𝓸 𝔀𝓮 𝓯𝓵𝔂 𝓲𝓷 𝔀𝓲𝓽𝓱 🎶 𝓹𝓸𝓵𝓸 🐐
Hmm hmmm I'm so sick of farewells and ripssss

Rest in pain. Song  I speak my mind even if it’s out of contact im a real general father owner of the life style that most can’t own Enternal Kings is where I stand numbers get hit I understand started as a small state to becoming world wide universal state of mind killings come with respect and fast act if you push we push what’s most known if I move away will it be the same they say once you’re in you’re dead they thought I would be a fuck up they made me a minute general if it comes to say shot ur shot and never give up promises to my self that the Kings will be known if they bust clips we chop up words sticks stones come with a bang pulling triggers used to be the thing now it’s knowledge if they hate we don’t get along I started from cooking to selling weapons to recruiting to bring me now I stay away from the block looking for a better day folded the paper I gained to believing in someone that would change me 4 years straight to turning back to who I really am a fuck up setting up spots for the dearly departed if it came to me I would change the world with my love ones if they came too me I would’ve done anything but now I lay in a grave where the cold stay age isn’t just a number it’s a life style if I die today will it be me being loved
“He gon let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind can I breathe, I know she might cry if i leave, i’ve been fooled by liers and theives,iced out my rolly but i know time cannot freeze”

If we bump heads like Marvin gaye let's get it on
Hi Polo G, A musical duo artist called "BSW" stole the melody/instrumental of this song of yours without asking for permission, and without mentioning it in their video description. It has now reached 10 million views. The title of the mentioned song is: "BSW - Mióta elhagytál (Nem vagyok álmos)" available here on youtube, and as I said, it has 10 million views. Don't let them steal your music. I think you should do something about it.
Anyone else think of one single person when he said “she aint all innocent she did a nigga wrong” or just me
Polo lowkey goes back to old songs and likes our comments🥰 This man is the absolute GOAT ! Just imagine how much hes gonna blowup this year😈😎 G.O.A.T

Dmac on the fucking track Tahj Money I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag, now I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they're goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic' I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad goin', bitch, we don't do no assist Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light, tryna load his blick Everyday a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you're down to see the coldest shit I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze Switchers on them glaciers, get to blowin' like it's for me Promise to my son, that the street won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on them, but they forcin' me See him in person, and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in the van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my nigga's gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Ain't for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

I’m so sick of farewells and rips 🤦🏻‍♂️😔
Artist of the century Sorry Juice
All of em on repeat
I decided to purchase his herbal medicine for herpes virus prepared from natural roots and herbs and my life got transformed and everything is fine and okay with me. Till now I have been going to check up and it is now going to four months and I am still negative thanks to Dr.Ozuka I will never stop telling the world about your good work
i am grateful to Dr Ozuka on YouTube for helping me on how to get rid of all forms of virus/STI with his natural herbs. this great herbal doctor also cured my sister from Sickle Cell
The every-song-sounds-the-same + Auto-Tune formula can keep a rapper afloat for only so long man.

Lyrics  I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag, now I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits  Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they're goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic' I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick  My whole squad goin', bitch, we don't do no assist Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light, tryna load his blick Everyday a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you're down to see the coldest shit  I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe?

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)
Let Jah lead love mother Africa trust in god ❤️🙏🏿🇬🇭🇯🇲

Keep doing yo thang Polo

I rlly luv polo gs new album n songs he is my favourite artist
Polo the goat
When you have hearing loss as a child, you dont understand people from the words... but you learn from the sound, the circumstances, the mimic and the rhyme, what it could mean. So there are people, that can give you on every line a rhyme-line, where each and every syllable rhymes.  And rhyming is magic. The next months I will listen to your rhymes.
This is better then any of his songs this one really talks to you
9 months ago @Polo G released this song....9 months after i still think this one of the coldest song!!!  He did nun but spit some real cold bars!!
hard
What did polo g mean when he used epidemic as the song name pls someone answer it's important????????
I'll leave a comment so whenever someone likes it years later I'll be reminded of this masterpiece 🖤

“Everyday a gamble wit yo life all you know is risk” Hands Down best lyric.

"You better pick out a casket cause they going quick"

Lyrical. Flow. Content. Melody. Message  Polo g the best right now
This one is one of my favorite song 😔 I cry to this song
I hope Illuminati don't take you bro. You scaring me with these album titles. "Die a Legend", "The GOAT", "Hall of Fame". Praying for you. Thank you for the real music.
Don’t like Polo G & his whiny songs but this been on repeat ✅
Polo g music is rubbish, a few songs he's made are good don't get me wrong. Yet most of his songs use the same formula and it gets old, for example listen to all three albums and there are songs which sound the exact same or have slight differences. People compare his to Tupac, how is that even possible to consider.
Loving from Africa? Drop a like
Polo g is the coolest rapper ever . This yute is humble 🙏🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Marko lost polo to hawt on the track .
came back from the album, almost forgot about this one now that i rememberrd it cant stop listening

yo drop yeezy match my dior bag that’s just what i’m feeling like that shii was hard
There are two different people who listen to this music 1. People who can relate to the lyrics 2. People who like the beat
“Don’t claim to be an op cuz niggas die from that disease” that’s facts…
Hall of Fame isn’t just a “cool album”, it’s a cultural reset, a reason to breathe, everything that I live for. it’s the reason why I wake up, the reason why I dress up, the reason why I eat, the reason why I still want to live in this mean world. it’s my everything.
One of the best Choruses 😱🌊🌊
Miss who you used to be cuz that’s who I was closer with I’m in Ma bag now I act like ion kno da bitch🤮🥱🤣

* God's grace *  Did you know that God loves you so much that he sent Jesus to save us? Jesus is the son of God! And he loves you very much! To have proof of this, we can say that he emptied himself of all his glory and stepped on the earth! Isn't that wonderful? And there's more! He assured us of salvation! He fulfilled the mission that God gave him! Which is to have a death on the cross for all people in the world! * How do I get to heaven? * It's very simple! -Accept Jesus as your Lord and only Savior! - Repent of your sins daily even those you don't know because you sinned out of ignorance! -Recognize that you do not deserve God's salvation but even with your faults He wanted to save you with his great love and grace! Now about keeping your faith -Read the Bible daily -Pray and fast -Go to a church that follows the word of God  May God bless you greatly! 👋

That's was one of the best song I heard
Lyrics:-   Dmac on the fucking track Tahj Money I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag, now I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they're goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic' I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad goin', bitch, we don't do no assist Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light, tryna load his blick Everyday a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you're down to see the coldest shit I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze Switchers on them glaciers, get to blowin' like it's for me Promise to my son, that the street won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on them, but they forcin' me See him in person, and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in the van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my nigga's gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Ain't for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

Dmac on the fucking track Tahj Money I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag, now I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they're goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic' I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad goin', bitch, we don't do no assist Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light, tryna load his blick Everyday a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you're down to see the coldest shit I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze Switchers on them glaciers, get to blowin' like it's for me Promise to my son, that the street won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on them, but they forcin' me See him in person, and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in the van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my nigga's gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Ain't for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

Dmac on the fucking track Tahj Money I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag, now I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they're goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic' I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad goin', bitch, we don't do no assist Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light, tryna load his blick Everyday a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you're down to see the coldest shit I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang, gang", mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe?

Goat
GOOGLE = POT FARMER POEM $$ I got out my pipe and stuffed it with pot You better believe, it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter and thumbed up a flame Then sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol; and smoked cigarettes Though, they did nothing, but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis and couldn't walk around When I rolled her a joint, she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack But, after I smoked some, to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high So I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around Then, got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where the wild birds nest And found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground and sowed all my seeds Then said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail The mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in my camouflage suit And used a corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn't be found. Then came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, and stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone But I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!

Man I love this dude. Every songs a 💣 (inna good way)
Can someone tell me why they not playing this song anywhere on the radio? People out there should really hear this kind of music but they rather promote and shove mindless music in everyone's faces like cardi b megan the stallion. But this here is ART.. real passion with real meaningful, thoughtful and inspirational lyrics. I just don't get it? I honestly feel like the music industry wants the masses behaving like a bunch of robots with no minds of their own completely void of all feelings with no respect for themselves or others... how sad
Polo g the goat forever best rapper

The righteous polo prognostically influence because leo seemingly sparkle an a nervous honey. axiomatic, infamous c-clamp
The late cement intrinsically peep because vein terminally seal during a impolite mustard. picayune, versed map
I was sent by ksi button
The sordid place differently bruise because snail disturbingly promise during a debonair debt. long-term, rigid red
The smooth trowel adventitiously ski because bait optimally melt absent a neat mint. rich, determined wood
The testy decision precisely prefer because disease histomorphometrically fail vice a murky point. married, unhealthy seed

The ambiguous shape constitutively name because wealth immunocytochemically develop since a wacky paper. raspy, first street
I just found something out rap is poetry well at least polo g does it is because the last word in a sentence usually rhymes with the last words in the sentences of the whole verse. That’s how there is poetry in rap.              P.S. Polo g is the best rapper
Had to break up with my girlfriend     She said polo sounds the same in every song
God protect the his goat for every thing he gotta stay a live don’t let’s us down

I just wish some of the young rapper's would leave all the gang, drug's, killings, money out they're rap lyrics and be more positive nowadays we can't really listen to they're music because of the gang violence behind it. I want to be able to drive in my car with my music sit on loud and feel safe at a red light.🤦

Depends what u seek ur mind about and who's there breath well stress of digital investment is what's the stress causing all thiss my best thing to say is take alot of caughtf drops the strong menthol kind and people forgot we just went thru one of the worst flus ever and like most makes us forgetful low on vitimims and the flu shots for sure saved us but As told we need high levels of vitamin c sunny d and stuff for lungs to take that cold breath away it's feels like a fat kid who ran a mile just take it easy on the stress and mind over matter syrup even know I take methadone a mixture of promethazine and methadone if ur on the methadone program that is saved my life and for the lazy something cheep and long lasting like ritalin for entry and for yah who likes Xanax there good and all but clonazepam has a strong mint that's good on the lungs if not a drug user just take as much vitimims as you can and eat the healthyist spicy foods and what best on thoughts
Need MORE!!🙌

Since his 22nd birthday of 2021, I’m praying for Polo G to have a better career in hip hop to get more popularity he needs to deserve it for his family, friends( and even the deceased rappers; King Von and Juice Wrld ).
Happy birthday 🐐🎊

I love this song
4 myself I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Once you get my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag, now I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew applyin' wars, tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they're goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when the post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick  My whole squad goin', bitch, we don't do no assist Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his nitch Might catch him at the red light, tryna load his blick Everyday a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the windy city where you're down to see the coldest shit  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Switchers on them glaciers, get to blowin' like it's for me Promise to my son, that the street won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep on ballin', just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta splash, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on them, but they forcin' me See him in person, then that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in the van  You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my nigga's gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Ain't for the head, that chopper spread, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

Polo G leading the new school rappers. Man look here.  1) mr capalot  2) LilBaby  3) let y'all choose
To whomever is reading this, I want to remind you that God loves you very much and he has a wonderful plan for your life! 😁  If you died suddenly this very moment, where do you think you would spend eternity?? If you are not sure, God wants to let you know that he loves you and he sent his Son Jesus to die for your sins that you would not perish but have eternal LIFE!  God came to me, saved me and filled me with his spirit when I was at a low point in my life a few years ago. God will do the same for you if you allow him. You have a choice, but know that YOU ARE GODS CHOICE and he will NEVER CHANGE! He wants a RELATIONSHIP with you! He loves you!  The bible says in Romans 6:23 that the  wages of Sin is death! But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour!! Romans 10:9,13 says that WHO EVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND BELIEVES IN THEIR HEART AND CONFESSES WITH THEIR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD SHALL BE SAVED!!  Im going to say a prayer for you! Lord bless my friend and their family with a long and healthy life. Lord I pray you protect them and make yourself real to them the same way you did for me in Jesus name. Friend, If you would like to receive Jesus in your heart or rededicate your life to him, right where you are say this with me with your heart and your lips out loud...  Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive of all my sins, wash me and cleanse me, set me free. I believe that Jesus died for me and is coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I'm on my way to heaven because Jesus is in my heart!  Friend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today that all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because Jesus Loves You and has a plan for your life!  If you prayed with me, plz type amen! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=900241527115892&id=100013901589755 https://youtu.be/tBR2nCS5zFI  God bless!😁  Dont believe?? 👇 Checkout these testimonies  https://youtu.be/XjTvi_wjZ9U https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLDcOBdOcvB_5PWtPqeFqI6JSLCih9EH6  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyjW59ePugmqPSWBJ-4n_Cl6UjBZFK1_N

HE SNAPPED
Hip hop "purists" that condemn all new generation hip hop as garbage because some artists aren't the new Nas or Raekwon without even giving them a chance are really missing out on some great music, with this man being the best example. Lyrically capable of hanging with anyone from any generation, literally never disappoints (and that's coming from someone who grew up in the early 2000s)
I’m so sick of farewells ands rips   That hit 🤧 I love this man polo stay goated friend

Yo how is every song Polo drops a banger?
Mann you representing Chicago now i really cant wait to see what he accomplish
@jessica watkins  it said in the article that the hollywood african american celebrities use a japanese skin lightening and bleaching lotion that makes them look from black to looking like mixed race with really light skin but they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/oeb-whitening-lotion-200-ml  i guess the reason they would deny using this skin lightening lotion is because they want people to think they are naturally light skinned thats the only reason i can think of.
We losing to many goats and hopefully not Polo G we need him RIP: King Von

Yo Polo, did they just claim your own mothafuckin song on your video? Bottom of the Desc, them suited niggas behind them desks look like they tryna rob you for the money on this vid.
Someone gotta tell Polo to stay incredibly safe and vigilant at all times. Given Juice and Von's untimely deaths, we can’t lose another young legend from a petty and avoidable incident. Him, Durk, and Keef the last survivors of a dying breed...
This shit hit different after losing king von
Am from somalia and i can relate to this livin legend Hope u feel wussup ma G
GOATTTTTTT!
HOPE ❤️, Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17  nkjv ❤️ 🙂

We can’t lose Polo g. We’re losing too many rappers these days to gun violence. I’m tired of all the good rappers dying. It’s scary knowing that once you get fame there’s always people out to kill you and put you in the cell. 2018-2020 are/were hell. Only rapper that still has me going is Polo.
still and always will be the goat
R.i.p to king von  R.i.p to pop smoke  🤘😭

Polo G is taking over the rap game and still making music for his fans with all this stuff going all around this world. We need Polo G in this world, he has been blessing from God himself. I good how rappers just come from  nothing and then come up and still make music and actually cares about his or her fans then represent where him or her came from. Unlike other rappers just make a hit then quit and not care about their fans and only care about their success. Polo G = 🐐

[Polo G - Epidemic| Lyrics]  [Intro]  (Dmac on the fuckin' track) (Tahj Money)  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 1] Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 2] Switches on them glizzys, get to blowin' like it's four of me Promise to my son that the streets won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on 'em, but they forcin' me See him in person and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in a van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my niggas gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Aim for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 1] Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit

Polo Goat
As a Chicago Public School teacher and inspirational rapper, my students have been telling me about Polo G for a while. I'm not familiar with his music, but I'm listening now. You don't have to like it, but respect the lyrical content and the message in the song. This is cold.
Ain't gonna lie ever since listing to you been my favorite rapper
Every PoloG song went hard! Legend already
"I'm so sick of Farewells and R.I.P's In the trenches yellin' Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease"    Best opening to a song but only a true hustler know those vibes
amazing
He doesn’t miss
He's a different breed i swear, put of all the rappers I've ever heard his energy gives me fucking goosebumps. Hopefully he dont fall in the making
anyone else realize the beat is almost the exact same as his xxl freestyle if you take off the beat?
Been stuck on this song for 4 weeks now polo g honest the most relatable artist and I definitely fuck with him

Polo being a few years younger than me is such an inspiration and speaks volumes to how many people he has touched. I feel anyone who listens to his music can take away positives from negative situations. I don't know who read this but keep grinding. Let God work his miracles for you.

I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 1] Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe?

I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Switches on them glizzys, get to blowin' like it's four of me Promise to my son that the streets won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on 'em, but they forcin' me See him in person and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in a van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my niggas gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Aim for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe?

https://youtu.be/7V3mlHEr9Pc lyrics Dmac on the fucking track Tahj Money  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Switches on them glizzys, get to blowin' like it's four of me Promise to my son that the streets won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on 'em, but they forcin' me See him in person and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in a van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my niggas gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Aim for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

Jesus Christ will return very soon. Please put your faith in him, and what he did on the cross. We, as humans, live in a sinful nature. We are sinners, but the good news is that Jesus Christ sacrificed himself so that our sins could be forgiven. The Gospel is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. Christ died for our sins, and on the third day, he rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven. Jesus loves and accepts everyone. It does not matter who you are or where you come from. He loves you, all you have to do is accept the GIFT that he provided for us. It's a gift that we do not earn ourselves. Not works, but through faith. Please get saved today.

The Gospel of Jesus Christ of Nazareth  The Gospel of Jesus Christ of Nazareth: Death happens to everyone. -  Hebrews 9:27 KJV And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: All have sinned.  Romans 3:12 KJV They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. We deserve death and hell. Romans 6:23 KJV For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Revelation 20:14-15 KJV And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.  [15] And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. Jesus took our death sentence. Romans 5:8 KJV But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Jesus Christ saves from sin and hell. 1 John 1:9 KJV If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Repent, and believe the gospel. John 3:5 KJV Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Mark 1:15 KJV And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. More important information: Say no to the chip (the mark of the beast) Revelation 19:20 KJV And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. Follow Jesus Christ, not other people, not a pastor, not a Pope, not religion.  Matthew 7:21-23 KJV Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  [22] Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  [23] And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. Jeremiah 17:5,7 KJV Thus saith the Lord ; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.  [7] Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is. The way to heaven is narrow. Matthew 7:13-14 KJV Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: [14] Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.   1 John 2:15-17 KJV [15] Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. [16] For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. [17] And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  Obey Acts 2:38

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism
Polo g forever ❤❤

I love this song
YOU are loved and in need of a savior , we are living in the last days . Please don’t turn away from God he is calling YOU. Deep down you know there is a higher power , a higher creator . John 3:16 , for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life . Repent of your sins , accept Christ as your savior . Believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that you have sinned , we have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  Believe that God sent his only son to die on the cross for your sins , the price of our sins was paid in full  ! Accept his gift and you will have an eternity with him.

Polo g is harder than young boy 👦
Who esle notice he rapping from pain 😧😦😮😣
Like if polo g is better then NLE Choppa
Like if polo g is better then NLE Choppa
Like Polo G is just so mature like he is not like other rappers having hella annoying adlibs he is not going “ yeah yeah “ every 2 seconds and I respect that also he raps about what’s on his mind and what he is feeling. Like Don’t Believe the Hype he says “ All them sit downs in that county made me think about my life “ that shows that he actually learns from his mistakes Polo G deserves everything. And it’s crazy how he can rap about everything and it still be fire using any type of beat which is crazy. Polo G if you are seeing this keep doing what you are doing cause I love it.
Yeah polo g real genuine, he even heartin these comments
Ayy
Bro literally doesn't have one bad song, its crazy💯💯🔥🐐
If you like this check out my music 🔥🔥🔥

Polo g carrying the 🌏 right now 🐐.
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism...

as it is written “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard,Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”  10 But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. 11 For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God. 1 Corinthians 2:9-12

Sleepy Joe finally came out of hiding from Grandma's house cause his supply of Oatmeal n' pot pie ran out. Sleepy Joe making promises but after 44 years of sleepiness in office at the white house still can't get nothing done. Sleepy Joe will need a doctor in the house to inject adrenaline up his butt and scream yowzers tonight. The Pinky(Biden) and The Brain(Trumpy) ... Giggity Giggity Alright

Got my popcorn n' beer ready for Trumpy vs Sleepy Joe Biden tonight. Gonna get real spicy n' feisty. Let's shutdown the radical left Democ-RATS. Sleepy Joe gonna have to call upon his teleprompter and earpiece paid for by Killary aka Hitlary. Sleepy Joe gonna call upon his family of violent protesters to destroy more property n' fires. Sleepy Joe finally came out of hiding from Grandma's house cause his supply of Oatmeal n' pot pie ran out. Sleepy Joe making promises but after 44 years of sleepiness in office at the white house still can't get nothing done. Sleepy Joe will need a doctor in the house to inject adrenaline up his butt and scream yowzers tonight. The Pinky(Biden) and The Brain(Trumpy) ... Giggity Giggity Alright!

This song is beautiful yo
Polo G never misses on his lyrics, if only the production for his songs were jus slightly better. Fr the only thing holding him back  are instrumentals that don’t match the complexity and tone of his lyrics.

https://youtu.be/F_i84rdIce8
I aint never heard a weak polo track🧐
I think this kind of music is overdone in the industry, but 20 years from now it will only be cats like Polo G  that will still be played religiously out the lot, and deservedly so.
Intro] (Dmac on the fuckin' track) (Tahj Money)  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 1] Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 2] Switches on them glizzys, get to blowin' like it's four of me Promise to my son that the streets won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on 'em, but they forcin' me See him in person and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in a van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my niggas gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Aim for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song
Why tf they change? It I like the other version better

Вооруженные силы Азербайджана вели огонь по воинской части Вардениса ВС Республики Армения, а также применили воздушные силы в направлении позиций. Этой операции противника предшествовала дезинформация Министерства обороны Азербайджана о том, что якобы Вооруженные Силы Республики Армения обстреляли из Варденисского района Дашкесанский район Азербайджана. Таким образом, фактически, противник попытался подготовить почву для обоснования своих дальнейших действий.   Ждите жесткого ответа.
A fews month ago, I found an Instagram Tool. This tool is very useful for Business Owner and only costs £2.53.

“Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze” polo G a poet.
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES  ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')    There are some things that you should know:    1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:    Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"    Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"    It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.    2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:    Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."    Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."    Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.    3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).    Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.     Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.    You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.     Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.    Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."    4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:    ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”    If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism

Polo G - Epidemic (Official Lyric) [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 1] Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 2] Switches on them glizzys, get to blowin' like it's four of me Promise to my son that the streets won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on 'em, but they forcin' me See him in person and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in a van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my niggas gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Aim for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

Romans 10 : 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

Hello guys! I want to tell you guys all something really amazing!!!! You know! Jesus christ died on the cross for our sin. He was beaten, hu ilated, and stripped naked. He did this all for all of us!! So we can stand by him, although we don't deserve it, in heaven . He did this because he cared for us! Each and every one of us!. Its time children of god! Yes! Each one of you are his children! And god wants you all to open your eyes and to seek him. To seek his goodness, his light, his warmth! Please stop listening to the lies and deception the demon always whispers to your ears. It's time to wake up and repent!! I know you guys can do it! So take up that sword and fight the evil demon and his temptation through god! Please repent and seek the lord, who waits for you day by day🙏🏿🙏🏿
Can I speak my mind , can I breathe 👏🏼🐐🐐

0:25 You can see some of his dead homies in the background. Respect.
Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16

Is there a way to say this song is bad
Polo g and Ryan lynch go crazyyy 🖤🐐
Fun fact Logan Paul and his friend were in this music video the yellow shirt guy and the white shirt next to him.
this song is just so good I dont know what else to say
Polo g is amazing. Feel like the people who say he has same vibe on each song don’t that that’s who he is. He talks about real shit. He doesn’t care about “club songs” he just wants to get a message across and tell his story. And that’s what his fan base love. Polo g could easily make any type of song. But he chooses stories.
Polo g us the best
Polo needs a single with the kid lario🤷🏾‍♂️🔥

I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit  I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 2] Switches on them glizzys, get to blowin' like it's four of me Promise to my son that the streets won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on 'em, but they forcin' me See him in person and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in a van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my niggas gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Aim for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song  I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s  In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

polo (g)oat
Polo really the only artist out here liking his comments 💯
“Your skin is not paper, so don’t cut it,  Your neck is not a coat, so don’t hang it,  Your size is not a book, so don’t judge it,  Your life is not a film, so don’t end it.”  These are not my words but I’m just spreading the word. Do the same. This saves lives. Suicide doesn’t ease the pain it passes it on to the people who love and miss you.
pure art

🌏STAND FOR ASSANGE  UNITED WORLD WIDE WE HAVE THE POWER TO ORGANIZE THE BIGGEST PROTEST IN HUMAN HISTORY.

Take time to consider your life without people like him...🤬😷🤐  Is there still Freedom of Speech in America ? Censorship has been successful in blinding us to our actual SIZE.   We are MUCH stronger than we know, yet we are still divided by many things. America is diverse because many different cultures have found a better place to live under the umbrella of the Constitution.   All Americans, from the Amish for Trump to Generation Z for Biden would loose the last vestige of freedom left on Earth, if we lost our freedom of speech.   We ALL need to lay down our differences and unite for the Freedom of Speech to END INTERNET CENSORSHIP.  INTERNET BILL OF RIGHTS 🇺🇸  Censorship is very real, and they can tape your mouth shut for any reason, at any time. 🤬  Thank God the Silent Majority are still gun owners!

Try to take a minute think about a charity I'm sure almost all of you have seen the commercials about send us $19 a month have you ever stop to think about how much money those Charities make every year your government leaders claim they are 8 billion plus people on our planet how many people out of all those people do you think send money to charity programs 5000 10000 20000 people donate every month even if it was only 10,000 out of 8 billion do the math on that on how much they are making every month every year and then ask yourself where in the hell is it all going beyond a shadow of a doubt the Wounded Warrior program in America alone makes enough money to buy almost every American in the country prosthetic arms and legs I have been seeing commercials about send the starving babies in Africa money for 45 years the children that was getting money sent to them when I was a child have their own children and grandchildren now and they still need more how is that possible when so much is sent to Charities every month every year there is something very crooked going on and no one seems to care it's about time you start caring before you all become the slaves you do not want to be the majority of you have already become slaves to the richest of the rich and the so-called government leaders stop being misled and uninformed about the world around you you are being bent over backwards by the richest of the rich and the so-called government leaders you do not have to be treated this way we can make a change the time is now let's take back our world from the bias discriminating racist that are the richest of the rich and the so-called government leaders

So, nobody noticed Rod Wave at the back 1:03
Remember that JESUS CHRIST died on the cross for every person’s sins on this earth and resurrected on the 3rd day in Glory to give us a way to salvation for eternity to be with Him. ““ Yes, GOD loved the world so much that HE gave HIS only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him would not perish but have eternal life”” John 3:16-17.JESUS The MESSIAH our Savior is coming soon for those who believe in Him, repent of all sin and to sin no more, accept JESUS in their life, and live a life of righteousness as HE commands us to. Jesus loves each and every one of us. Repent and turn your life to JESUS, read the bible, live well in JESUS ChRIST’S name as HE is the ONLY way to salvation. Please do not time away from Jesus christ. Tell JESUS that you admit you are a sinner as we all are, You admit that you need Him, Tell Him you accept HIm into your heart and life as your ONLY LORD and SAVIOR and KING because HE is Lord,tell Him to wash your garments clean and wash away all uncleanness, worldliness, and sin from your heart including the things that only He can see to purify everything of you and your spiritual heart, Tell Him to write your name in the book of life, to command All of you, your soul, and spirit to never leave his righteousness path that leads to Him. AMEN.

*LORD JESUS DIED & ROSE AGAIN TO FREE U FROM SIN ACCEPT HIS GIFT* ✝️✝️✝️
Chicago the goat
ITS POLO GOAT 🐐
This is the Most important post you’ll ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments; To lie even once makes us liars, to steal even once makes us thieves. & James 2 : 10 states that to break one of the laws makes us guilty of them all. Problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because the creator is perfectly holy, meaning his standard is outside our reach; & just as he is perfect in holiness, he is also perfect in justice. So sin must go punished, & the wages of sin is death & hell, which the Holy Bible describes as eternal fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  Thankfully God is so merciful, 2000 years ago he sent his son Jesus Christ down from his throne in heaven to this earth, & here he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take on judgment on our behalf by becoming our sin, & dying a grim death on a cross. Before he died, he said “it is finished” meaning, the debt of our sins has been paid in full. & On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement, not by earning it, but as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected  So what you must do in response is go before God & humbly admit you have sinned against him, turn away from your old ways through gratitude in his sacrifice, & confess with your mouth Jesus Christ is Lord, savior, & the ruler of your life from that moment forward. (Romans 10:9). The moment this happens God will grant you a new heart, new desires, & eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers.   This is the most urgent decision all of us will ever make, as it determines where we will spend eternity; & all of us wether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; do not even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written(Hebrews 9:27);   ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’  All glory honor & praise to Lord Jesus Christ
Polo is the face of the industry for now 💎🖤

Lyrics-  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thiefs Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Once you get my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag, now I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew applyin' wars, tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they're goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when the post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad goin', bitch, we don't do no assist Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his nitch Might catch him at the red light, tryna load his blick Everyday a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the windy city where you're down to see the coldest shit  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thiefs Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Switchers on them glaciers, get to blowin' like it's for me Promise to my son, that the street won't get no more of me Remember every line from that See they peep on ballin', just go on the ignorin' me Always gotta spass, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on them, but they forcin' me See him in person, then that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in the van You know it's fuck the other side Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bop heads like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Ain't for the head, that chopper spread, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thiefs Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.

God is the cure. God loves you. God made you. God is the creater of the universe. We are all sinners. The wages of sin is death. He sent His son Jesus to die on the cross to save you from those sins. God forgives you for those sins. If you believe that He sent His son to die and the Jesus was rose from the dead, trust in Him with all your heart, admit to Him that you are a sinner, and confess your sins to Him, you will be saved. Please listen to this. God has a purpose and plan for you. Pray that God will help you in your problems. He will not only give you happiness, but also joy. May God bless you.

“Your skin is not paper, so don’t cut it,  Your neck is not a coat, so don’t hang it,  Your size is not a book, so don’t judge it,  Your life is not a film, so don’t end it.”  These are not my words but I’m just spreading the word. Do the same. This saves lives. Suicide doesn’t ease the pain it passes it on to the people who love and miss you.

I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 1] Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit    Skip Ad    [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 2] Switches on them glizzys, get to blowin' like it's four of me Promise to my son that the streets won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on 'em, but they forcin' me See him in person and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in a van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my niggas gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Aim for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song

Universal Declaration Of Human Rights  Article 19  ‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.’  UNITE TO FIGHT CENSORSHIP 🇺🇸  This is a list of American Patriots who perhaps have different ideas, beliefs, religions and yes, theories...yet everyone of them is willing to fight for the 1st and 2nd Amendments.   Development of theory and seeking truth depends on the ability to share information with others...if you don’t have this, what do you THINK you have?   Does MSM continually to lie to you?   Define ‘lemmings’. 🐀   Do you think channels like ICONS or ALICE DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE could even exist in China?  Imagine a world without anyone as courageous as JULIAN ASSANGE.  Take time to consider your life without people like him...🤬😷🤐  Is there still Freedom of Speech in America ? Censorship has been successful in blinding us to our actual SIZE.   We are MUCH stronger than we know, yet we are still divided by many things. We ALL need to lay down our differences and unite for the Freedom of Speech to END INTERNET CENSORSHIP.  INTERNET BILL OF RIGHTS 🇺🇸  Censorship is very real, and they can tape your mouth shut for any reason, at any time. 🤬  Thank God the Silent Majority are still gun owners!

Polo g is a goat I dont care what you haters his fire
Yaradan beni 2007 de bir gecede  ıslah etti ve 2017  e kadarda eğitti vede ilk emrini 2019 da fakirlik haramdır diye vahyetti ve  bakın kardeşlerim Rabbimiz nediyor kendilerini Benim  dostum olarak ilan ettikleriniz ki,bilirseniz bu çok büyük bir söz ve bu sözle üzerinize büyük bir azabı çektiniz.Siz kutsal kitapları okuyup durduğunuz halde neden ihtiyaçtan fazlasını verin,fakirlerin hakkını verin,Faiz yemeyin  demiyorsunuz eğer Bu sözleri söyleseydiniz ülkelerinizde fakirlik olmaz idi çünkü sizler çokluğuyla övünenler tüm cemaatler ve tarikatler,hiristiyanların lideri papa yahudilerin hahamları sizler Rabbimizin sevgisi için değil  dünyalık ve saltanat için insanları  kullandınız,Ama hayır çok yakında sizler ve size inananlar azabı göreceksiniz ve yaptıklarınızdan hesaba çekileceksiniz. RABBIMİZ güzel sözlü ve doğruyu söyleyendir..!

HEY YOU! Yes, you, sitting behind your screen reading this. I don't know you and you certainly don't know me. But I want to tell you something. Everyone has their own story. Yours might be filled with joy and happiness, or it might be clouded with pain and misfortune. I want you to know that you're a beautiful, wonderful, talented person. Even if your life isn't going the way you want it to right now, I know that you'll be able to make it out alright. I want you to do me a favor. I know I'm just a stranger, but just trust me, okay? Every time you see your reflection, be it in the mirror in the bathroom, in a window somewhere, or in a puddle on the street, I want you to look at yourself and give yourself a hug. Because even if you aren't the prettiest or the smartest or the funniest, you're something that no one else can be: you. And you are the greatest thing you can be. Smile at strangers. Be confident in yourself. Cry when you feel like crying, laugh when you feel like laughing. Treat yourself like a god/goddess because you deserve it. Hold your head up and keep your heart open. You're worth everything and then some. And always remember that no matter what, even if it doesn't seem like it, you're everything to someone. I was bullied for so long and was told that I wasn't beautiful, and it broke me down. But I realized that I am beautiful and so is everyone else. I wanted to make sure no one felt upset like I did - hating myself and crying to sleep. You are all special <3

❤️ from India 🇮🇳 🙏
When I was 18 I was searching for the truth about life. Why am I here? What’s the point? What’s the truth about life? One day when I was in the shower I had a vision. I was sitting in the rain and it was dark. In front of me was a bush and above the bush was a bright light with the face of man in the light. There was a demon like the girl from the exorcist trying to stab me from every direction but couldn’t hurt me. The one in the light told me that He was protecting me from the demon. That was why it couldn’t hurt me. In the distance I saw three people but they were just dark figures like shadows and they were people laughing at me, mocking me, and scoffing at me. The Lord told me that people will laugh at you, and mock you, but don’t be afraid because I’m with you, and I will comfort you. After this experience an overwhelming sense of pure Love and Peace came over me. It was unlike anything I’d ever experienced. It was everything I wanted, needed, and was searching for. It was the best feeling in the world. Today I realize that it was Jesus who I saw. He came to me and came upon me. From that day on God took me on a journey to find Him and to Know Him. The Love of God is more profound and more powerful than anything you can imagine. It satisfies every part of your being. It is pure life and pure Love. There are no words good enough to describe it. God Bless you today.
Polo really out here making my heart ache
💯🥀💨

2020 be like:
Polo 139 for 139
God plzz keep dis man alive🙏💙
I don't know how else to explain it.. There's something about this exact chord in instrumental beats that just automatically makes people emotional.. like.. it is the "realest shit I've ever wrote" key.. if you've cheated on your girl, or your homie died, or you just wanna say thank you or you dedicating this song to your mama, or you crying out for help..   I like this song.  It's a cheat code.
His locs go hard 🔥
Goat on a boat

Absolutely fire by da goat 🐐 🔥

i’m finna cry 😢
This is the Most important post you’ll ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments; To lie even once makes us liars, to steal even once makes us thieves. & James 2:10 states that to break one of the laws makes us guilty of them all. Problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because the creator is perfectly holy, meaning his standard is outside our reach; & just as he is perfect in holiness, he is also perfect in justice. So sin must go punished, & the wages of sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as eternal fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  Thankfully God is so merciful, 2000 years ago he sent his son Jesus Christ down from his throne in heaven to this earth, & here he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take on judgment on our behalf by becoming our sin, & dying a grim death on a cross. Before he died, he said “it is finished” meaning, the debt of our sins have been paid. & On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement, not by earning it, but as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected  So what you must do in response is go before God & humbly admit you have sinned against him, turn away from your old ways through gratitude in his sacrifice, & confess with your mouth Jesus Christ is Lord, savior, & the ruler of your life from that moment forward. (Romans 10:9). The moment this happens God will grant you a new heart, new desires, & eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers.   This is the most urgent decision all of us will ever make, as it determines where we will spend eternity; & all of us wether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; do not even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written(Hebrews 9:27);   ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’  All glory, honor & praise to Lord Jesus Christ
“Iced out my Rollie, but I know time can not freeze”🥵

#2 trending what a goat 🐐
If you died right now would you go to heaven or hell?  It's important because this is where you will spend all eternity. Would you rather burn in the lake of fire or be in the loving arms of Jesus our saviour. When Jesus died on the cross, He died for ALL. Because all of us have sinned and sin deserves death.. Every single person He cares for and wants to join His kingdom. Take this opportunity before it's too late.  "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." ( Romans 10:13)

I feel all et shii he saying. This man polo g speak facts.
Dear precious one, our hope and peace are found in Jesus Christ our Savior. The broken world we live in can be a “factory of sadness”. There seems to be an endless supply of heartache and disappointment, whether from our own choices or things beyond our control. Yet the follower of Christ has hope—not only in the life to come but for this very day.                                                     Jesus said, “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world” (John 16 : 33). Notice that without minimizing the struggles or sadness we may experience, Christ counters them with His promises of peace, joy, and ultimate victory.  Dear one, find comfort and joy in the fact that peace is available in Christ, and it’s more than enough to help us navigate whatever life throws at us.                                                     Begin your intimate, loving relationship with our Creator by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Welcome Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. You will then be sealed in salvation and blessed abundantly. Your life will be forever changed!   May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️
JESUS IS COMING Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️   “ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY   GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!!   #christian #jesus #faith #love #god #bible #christ #church #christianity #fairtrade #gospel #hope #blessed #jesuschrist #truth #handmade #prayer #pray #scripture #life #holyspirit #worship #peace #godisgood #inspiration #religion #bibleverse #encouragement #motivation #goodnews

This is hard polo fr
“Have you never heard? Have you never understood? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of all the earth. He never grows weak or weary. No one can measure the depths of his understanding. He gives power to the weak and strength to the powerless. Even youths will become weak and tired, and young men will fall in exhaustion. But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.” ‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭40:28-31‬ ‭

Polo 💯🔥
he DONT MISS
And he not lien😔🤟🏾💯.
*For everyone reading this, I’m sorry 2020 is so bad, I’m sorry you have to go through this, I’m sorry life is harder than ever right now, I’m sorry for the losses we have had this year. I know it’s not my fault but this year really makes me feel like we were only brought into this world to suffer. To stress over grades, homework and bills. To live our lives only to watch the ones you love pass away, only to go through all this pain and try to make all this money just for it to all disappear . For all the kids that are growing up and have to go through what I’ve been through or worse, because the stuff I been through has been really bad, your going to make it out. You will succeed. Everyone follow your dreams, you will find the most happiness if you take that path. I know it’s scary but just do it because at the end of the happiness is all that matters.*

The difference between polo and other rappers is that he always tells a story in his music. From his own personal life. Mixing in fire beats and lyrics.

Un niño le preguntó a una niña en una biblioteca: "¿Te importa si me siento a tu lado"? La niña respondió con una fuerte voz enojada; "¡¡No quiero pasar la noche contigo !!  Toda la gente de la biblioteca empezó a mirar al chico y se sintió avergonzado. Después de unos minutos la chica caminó tranquilamente hacia la mesa del chico y le dijo: estudio psicología y sé lo que está pensando el hombre, supongo que te sentiste avergonzado, ¿no? El tipo respondió en voz alta: $ 300 por una noche ¡Eso es demasiado! y toda la gente en la biblioteca miró a la chica en estado de shock y el chico le susurró al oído, "Estudio leyes y sé cómo hacer culpable a alguien ... 🤭   Si te gusta el comentario, por favor, escribe "savscribe" a mi canal ... Sé que escribí mal ortografía y gramática 🤗 Pero YouTube no permite la promoción ...

A boy asked a girl in a library, "Do you mind if I sit beside you"?  The girl Answered with a loud angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you!!  All the people in the library started staring at the boy and he was embarrassed.  After minutes the girl walked quietly to the guy's table and said to him I study psychology and I know what man is thinking, I guess you felt embarrassed,right?  The guy responded with a loud voice :$300 for one night That's too much!! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the guy whispered in her ears,  "I study law and I know how to make someone guilty....🤭   If you enjoy the comment plz do “savscribe”to my channel...., I know I had written wrong spelling and grammar 🤗 But YouTube don't allow promotion...

This is your friendly reminder that if you live in the US and are going  to vote absentee this coming November to please DELIVER YOUR BALLOT IN  PERSON TO THE POLLING BOOTH. Trump is going to stop counting ballots  after election day and declare himself the winner. This is not a troll  or an exaggeration. They are already planning to do this. He wants to be  the first American dictator. tell everyone you know.
Вот скажи мне, американец, в чём сила! Разве в деньгах? Вот и брат говорит, что в деньгах. У тебя много денег, и чего? Я вот думаю, что сила в правде: у кого правда, тот и сильней!

I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 1] Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe?

Time cannot freeze
wolo g!!!!
You so called blacks hispanics and native Americans are the lost Israelites according to the bible and history, the world has lied to you. The laws are not done away with like the pastor's have told you. You must still keep all the commandments. Repentance isn't repenting and doing the same thing over and over. Christ died to give you a chance at grace, similar to a grace period for a bill. But remember that bill must still be paid. I advice anyone who wants to know the truth to watch hidden enemies 1-6 by cnycefilms144. I love you all.
this reminds me of finer things.
“Can I speak my mind can I breath”🖤

Polo the goat 💯💯favorite rapper
After everyone's last breath on earth, the soul (spirit) goes to a new place; that's either Heaven or Hell.  How is heaven? heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.  How is hell? Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever.   Hell is a place of suffering from intense tormenting, so why choose to go there instead of going to Heaven?   Here is the steps you must read, understand and believe in order to be sure you will be on your way to Heaven.   Salvation J-sus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). He also said, "I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved" (John 10:9, NASB). J-sus is not only the way to heaven, he is also the door to heaven.  Realise you are a sinner; Isaiah 64:6 (UKJV) But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses(the quality of being morally right) are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.  Deserving hell for sins Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 G-d warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed G-d, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that J-sus Chr!st got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Repent So repent, Repenting means: to change your mind; a sincere turning away, in heart, mind and action; Therefore G-d wants you to repent of sinful values and of sinful living. G-d wants you to decide to follow Him and to make J-sus the Lord of your life.  No other way  If you want to go to heaven, you've got to go through the door marked "J-sus Chr!st." There is no other entrance.  By no other entrance it means belief in gods, Buddha, Muhammad or other beings or objects cannot save you; But only belief in J-sus Chr!st our Lord can save you.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what J-sus did for you as simple as that. Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe  All you need to do is to truly believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that J-sus Chr!st suffered and got crucified and shed his blood for your sins at the cross, He was buried but rose again on the third day just to prove he was G-d and now alive in heaven. After that you will receive the holy spirit and you will know that you are going to heaven after death or when J-sus comes back while you are still alive.  After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life. Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
Garbage   sick

This world is headed for an apocalyptic, communist, new world order beast system where everyone will be required to take a mark on their right hands or in their foreheads just to be allowed to buy or sell (Revelation 13:16-18). God has spoken. This is the fate of humanity and it cannot be changed. The only way to escape what’s coming is by putting all your trust in Jesus Christ’s death, burial and resurrection. All who believe on the  Lord Jesus Christ will receive forgiveness of all sins, eternal life in Heaven, and, as a bonus, all believers who are alive when Christ returns will get raptured out before the apocalypse begins and the antichrist takes over. You can have all of these blessings if you will simply believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.   Romans 10:13 KJV *For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.*  Call upon the Lord Jesus and receive the gift of eternal life ASAP because time is short! Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved from an eternity in hellfire!

REMEMBER   Mark 14: 1-9 Right now there is a debutante contemplating suicide because she wasn’t invited to the social event of the year. Remember you live in your own house, well-fed, loved; the landlord from hell? You have a roof over your head; homeless? You are not a refugee running for your life; seeking refuge? you can run, move, have family; can’t run or move? Even on your hospital bed you are cared for and alive. Remember JESUS loves you. The worst thing, absolute worst thing that can happen to any of us is to end up in hell for rejecting, ignoring, trying to fool – JESUS. Remember you are blessed, favoured, free indeed.

Polo G , wake up , that goat symbolizes the Illuminati satanic freemason, riding the goat the baphamet , get out of satan system and get in God system before its to late people claim they love God and want to go to heaven but lifestyle heart mind mouth lyrics and soul says satan and hell ⏳
I love the young Chicago artist I always have starting from Keef to Herb and so on. But Polo G hit different. His lyrics dont make you want to kill they make you want to do better. His his story telling is uplifting. Keep it rocking little homie. The young ones in your city watching you.

R.I.P to all ours close friends and family🕊✨🙇🏽
For anyone scrolling through the comments going through a really hard time I truly hope things get better for you no matter who you are. Please don't give up trying. There is a reason you are here reading this message, to remind you that YOU are so important to God and His Son Jesus Christ. I can only imagine what you are going through but God knows. I also know how difficult life can be and I may not understand your exact experience but I am truly sorry that things have been so tough for you. I care and want you to know that you are not alone, you have a purpose, you are worthy of so much. Please take it one day at a time, one step at a time. I am praying that God will send His angels to each and everyone of you to comfort you, surround you with His love, give you peace beyond measure, and to change things for the better. Please know that you are here for a reason and that sometimes we don't always know why we go through things, maybe to help someone else going through the same thing because you understand such pain that someone else may not.  Please also know you also have a Savior Jesus Christ who died for you, He loves you more than you could ever know. Please ask Him for forgiveness of wrongs and ask Him into your heart believing with sincerity. He can guide you in all things. I speak from experience it doesn't matter what we have done or that we think we don't measure up He will meet us where we are, even in our lowest low. He can give you peace beyond measure, I speak from experience. I can only imagine how hard it has been for you but I truly hope the best is yet to come for all of you. Please never give up, because He won't give up on us. Please remember this when things are hard and you feel at the end of your rope
❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯

PLEASE READ VERY CAREFULLY  Armageddon's 4 Horses are the BOW, SWORD, SCALES & FIRE = Send it, Strike it, Split it & Sear it.  <--- *THOSE ARE 4 ACTION EVENTS.*   They started LAST YEAR. Yes, the 1st Horseman Started last year! Our planet SENT (Bow=SEND it) over 300 Rockets into Space since last year and each DAY we send a average of 3.23 MORE! Go inquire at the Observatories as to why ALL the Telescopes on this planet are CURRENTLY pointing to the WEST! A ROCK is COMING and That's what all those Rockets are for and no one is telling anyone about it! Those Rockets are WEAPONS! When they STRIKE (2nd Horseman Sword= STRIKE it), that Rock, it will SPLIT (3rd Horseman= Scales = SPLIT it) and a SPLIT piece of it will hit Our Planet, that is the 4th Horseman of Armageddon, the FIRE = SEAR it. Wake up WORLD!! Armageddon is upon Us. WATCH to the WEST for it will hit the Pacific Ocean and it will rock up and down the Pacific FIRE RING and it will send lava to the Skies when it does. It will rain fire over 2/3rd's of this planet! If you live anywhere near the Pacific, you need to move now! Move BEFORE they STOP sending the Rockets up, that's when you'll know they are ready and waiting on the rock to get here. Please come see my Armageddon video and make sure you read all my comments! Please, I'm begging you with all my heart and soul to listen to me. https://youtu.be/1UGpXddwv8I

Polo g really the goat bro he aint neva had one bad song amd he neva will
wen i heard the hook i got hooked all facts no printer bruhhh
First off let me start by saying thank you for all the blessings and answer prayers that you have given me. Today I was on YouTube and I ran across the Galveston live cam and I just wanted to say that I share a concern for them up there in Galveston and I was wondering if you could help me pray for them because I think that they are in some type of danger and I think that maybe more of us need to go out there and just see like what's going on. Prayers for the residents well-being for the caretaking of the beach, prayers for the law enforcement because they seem a little hostile and in danger as well. I'm not really exactly sure what's going on there but I would like some help investigating if that's possible thank you. Much love

But I really don’t want to see polo pass away when Juice Wrld passed away it hurt me a lot. It also hurt me a lot with pop smoke but just not as much. But I hope to see polo live his whole life. If you see this polo g your doing amazing and a lot of people are loving it and your going to grow really quickly. Anyways have a great day everyone.

What in tarnation is this feces?
do you know that God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life? If you were to die this very second, do you know for sure, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you would go to Heaven?  Let me quickly share with you what the Holy Bible reads. It reads “for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God” and “for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” The Bible also reads, “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” And you’re a whosoever right? Of course you are; all of us are.  I’m going to say a quick prayer for you. Lord, bless my friends and their families with long and healthy lives. Jesus, make Yourself real to them and do a quick work in their heart. If they have not received Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, I pray they will do so now.  If you would like to receive the gift that God has for you today, say this after me with your heart and lips out loud.  “Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart. Forgive me of my sin. Wash me and cleanse me. Set me free. Jesus, thank You that You died for me. I believe that You died for me. I believe that You are risen from the dead and that You’re coming back again for me. Fill me with the Holy Spirit. Give me a passion for the lost, a hunger for the things of God and a holy boldness to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I’m saved; I’m born again, I’m forgiven and I’m on my way to Heaven because I have Jesus in my heart. Amen.”  if you said that prayer, as a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I tell you today all your sins are forgiven. Always remember to run to God and not from God because He loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.  If you said that prayer, LIKE THIS COMMENT. Jesus loves you and I love you too ❤️
😳🥵🇧🇷

Anyone else notice Logan Paul and his friend Mac in the background at 1:28 ?
If you believe that there’s no God and that nothing made the universe. Then if God is no-thing and therefore is nothing. Then can’t the universe come from him? Also if you believe that the universe is infinite; then how is it that our bodies are part of the universe whilst our consciousness is also part of our bodies whilst our consciousness came into existence via our birth? This means that our consciousness is finite because it began, there for our bodies are finite and finally the universe MUST be finite... This is what Islam promotes.
For all of y’all that disliked my favorite rapper’s song .... we gon shake word 2 my mother 😑🤚🏼

yo this like to dislike ratio is insane
Polo G is probably the realest rapper there is today
“Just got back to ignoring me” I DONT NEED THIS FAKE LOVE
All The way From Africa Polo G u Rock 💪😃🙏💕
dont claim to be a opp people die from that disease
Such boring music.
"miss who you used to be that's who im closer with" 💔💔
‘Missed who you used to be, cause that’s who I was closer with’💔 Polo G speaking on a whole nother level, his music speaks out to everyone, everyone can relate to it. He ain’t care what every other artist is talkin bout, he’s in his own unique lane. My man speaks to the heart and soul, I’ve never ever seen any artist who has the talents and capabilities that he does. It’s just so pure and different. Not only his musical/rapping abilities like his crazy melodic flows and delivery/voice, his bars just hit on a different level, and he speaks only the truth. He speaks about things you wouldn’t expect rappers nowadays to rap about and spread messages on. Like ‘Iced out my Rollie but I know that time can not freeze’🥶, bars hit different, polo g my man you will now and forever carry and build a legacy on your name, I really hope you the best in your upcoming years and success, and I know you’ll be at the top and stay there , much love🤞🖤
Goat 🐐
yup this heat
DAMN
people say polo is over rated when he isnt at all he puts passion in every lyric and people dont try to listen to that

Romans 3:23-26 (KJV)  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.  John 3:16-18 (KJV)  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  Believe in your HEART on the Son of God before it's too late!!!   If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your HEART that God raised Him from the dead. You shall be SAVED!!!
We say we need time to achieve non violence because I am conditioned to violence and non violence. The non violence is not a fact, it is an idea, the fact is violence, can you observe that fact without introducing its opposite?

You ever wonder why your life sucks? Do you blame God for everything but never tried to speak to Him? Have you tried finding out some more information on God? God has been trying to find ways to communicate with you. Please open up to him. Tell God “I don’t know what I am doing, I need you to guide me please Father” that will be the beginning of change. Your life will forever be changed for the better. Open up, don’t be so closed, life is short, fragile and we need love that comes from God.
Yes sir
.
He real life don't misss bro he the goat fr I was rockin wit bro since check me out and the come up but yall new fans don't know about that
Aye shit hits so hard
ATTENTION:  You are in dire need of a savior whether you believe this or not it’s true. Jesus is the only way to Heaven. He lived a perfectly sinless life we can’t live  ourselves because we’re infected with sin, thanks to Adam and Eve, and he died on the cross, shedding his pure blood that washes away our sins, and then he rose again on Easter. When you believe on Him alone to save you from hell, you will be saved and have eternal life. Don’t wait. This is your eternity we’re talking about. You can die any second and can’t go back to this life. Please! God doesn’t want anyone to go to hell. He wants all to turn away from sinful living and to surrender to him. God is with you. He’s listening. He’s waiting for you to talk to him. He is gracious and full of mercy.

Lyrics I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe?

Polo G deserves his own religion. We need to praise him, because he’s obviously not human. I have heard many human rappers, there is no way he’s human, maybe alien. He’s the greatest.
Me Listening to Polo g  showering: playing polo g doing dishes: playing polo g on zoom: playing polo g alexa: playing polo g

I don't how people hate on this Man, he try's so hard to be the best putting thought in his music and how he is going to execute it he thinks on how this will affect people, he also acknowledged all his friends and family who have passed on when most rappers don't.. this man has so much more potential and he has the right mindset, skills, vision, and understandings to pull it off and perfect it.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Polo G never makes a bad song every time he's releasing a new song he's improving into a real GOAT!
Idk bout y’all but polo g the only rapper that sound like he from the Bible
ain't no one else like polo 🚫🧢
God please protect this man. He’s special and we need him 🙏

A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later they both go out together and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be?
Polo is goated
One reason I love polo's songs so much is because they give hope to people in a struggle right now. I am not in a big struggle but I know people that are. Polo talks about his pain and it speaks to me when i'm in pain. I feel like he's someone to talk to even though I don't know him.

This man really DOES NOT MISS
Dam my man got mussels
Polo a goat ong someone gotta protect him we can’t lose him
Polos really bringing scorey up he’s coming in his music videos now
There is not a Polo G song i call trash, the guy has so much potential, He puts time and effort into every lyric, he has also lost many of his loved ones including his grandma, Maxine, she holds a very close relationship with him and he knows to put respect on her name. Even though he has went through all of this he still has the strength to keep fighting, most of us can agree that he has helped us throughout though times, personally i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him because whenever i felt out of mind, i turned on a Polo G song and would just sit there and be in my zone. Polo G needs more recognition and I know im not the only one who thinks that. Much love Polo 🙏🏽.
Polo G Straight up Motivates me to do what I have to do to make it out the hood
Just a nice mellow flow This the kind of hip hop i appreciate not people constantly screaming GLOCK NINE, Pistol is your whip, methhead coke sometimes its really aggressive Can't say some aggressive rappers don't have a few bangers but its too much. big respect to this i vibe all day
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
What a year for polo g
where the haters at?
Bro you rap the same way. That makes me know the song without hearing it. The same way of rapping but it's fire

Me I saw that a new song was released I jumped out of my chair
Let’s goooo
Epidemic"  Dmac on the fucking track Tahj Money  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thiefs Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Once you get my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag, now I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew applyin' wars, tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they're goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when the post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad goin', bitch, we don't do no assist Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his nitch Might catch him at the red light, tryna load his blick Everyday a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the windy city where you're down to see the coldest shit  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thiefs Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  Switchers on them glaciers, get to blowin' like it's for me Promise to my son, that the street won't get no more of me Remember every line from that See they peep on ballin', just go on the ignorin' me Always gotta spass, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on them, but they forcin' me See him in person, then that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in the van You know it's fuck the other side Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bop heads like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Ain't for the head, that chopper spread, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song  I'm so sick of "Farewells" and "R.I.P's" In the trenches yellin' "Gang, gang, mob ties, what I bleed" Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that .9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thiefs Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

Polo G has to be my favorite rapper❤
There's only been two rappers ever to walk the face of the earth that can tell a relatable story to every listener, make zero skips throughout every album, touch me personally with the genius lyricism and at the same time push the positive out of negative situations. Thats Polo G and Tupac. Theres not a single other rapper that can continuously fall into every single one of these categories except these two. Polo you have helped to change my life for the better. Let God bless you and keep you safe because we need people like you in the world to make a change in the dark world we live in. Amen? Amen!
Polo G got mad bars, this song is fire 🔥🔥🔥
Polo g the greatest right now  , noone can disagree u d goat 💙

This song hits me so hard. I could feel the song... That’s why Polo is unique. He tells a story in a beautiful flow which hits hard for everyone. You’re the goat polo 🐐
This is going on my playlist. Good shit Wolo G

In a few years I can say I was here from the beginning..
Intro] (Dmac on the fuckin' track) (Tahj Money)  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 1] Once you give my pussy up, it's over with Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit   [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze  [Verse 2] Switches on them glizzys, get to blowin' like it's four of me Promise to my son that the streets won't get no more of me Remember every line from that obituary poetry See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on 'em, but they forcin' me See him in person and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin' Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in a van You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my niggas gone Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on Aim for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song  [Chorus] I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease He gon' let that 9 blow with ease Can I speak my mind, can I breathe? I know she might cry if I leave I been fooled by liars and thieves Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze.

beautiful, Only here for the last 20 seconds but Ima tell all my friends at school tommorow bout this song I hope to produce for you one day my youtube is "SHONDASHEEP undefined" you are my favorite rapper who is still alive, and is making music. don't die It would really hurt me stay away from the streets, stay away from the drugs, don't trust anyone who has too of good intentions because they probably don't, and you will be remembered for the next 40 years or more, you have too much talent, freestyleing, writing, singing, rapping, and writing beautiful lyrics. stay safe! you are a GOAT!
