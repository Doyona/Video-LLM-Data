“Rio De Janeiro” “Spanish” “They’ve got billions of people” I’m not even Brazilian and I’m offended
….why is no one saying that that isn’t Jamaica’s national dish… tbf I don’t think they could handle ackee 😭😭😭
Where sweden
in what world does "curd" mean melted
Name a Jamaican you say....hmmm, Mason Greenwood.
Our national dish is lamb ( fermented lamb )
can you so this but europe
Fidel was not a dictator lord jaysus
Chip possessing the palate of a 12 year old
i think they could continue this series, its interesting and could be fun with other countries dishes
Every country, proceeds to only do upwards of 10
Poutine is the best
You probably had the worst Wiener Schnitzel inside of the UK imagineable. God that looked grim
the sudden bahasa indonesia had me rolling loll
“Every country” and then there’s like 5
chip is so disgustingly stupid, it hurts
British folks saying food that tatses like it would be from the UK is ballsy
This is the whitest thing I've ever seen 😭
What you had on the plate was not a poutine, you shouldn't taste test food with a british accent, it makes you seem like posh twats who dont have a real pallet. Stick to beans and toast and mashing abd stuffinf things into pies.
Chile mentioned <3
What child man doesn't eat veg?
that looks like the worst schintzel ever. im vegan and i know the real ones look and taste better.
9:12 as an Austrian, I can tell y‘all that whoever made this, has totally fucked it
I clicked on this video and audibly said who the fuck is that and where's james
I like samosas more then jerk chicken
Oooooooh yeaaaaaaah😀🇨🇦
the wiener schnitzel should come with sides and not be dumped in butter - but hey I'm not saying that suddenly makes it S tier
Cant believe they got every country in under 10 minutes
Poutine was the right pick for S tier.    Being Canadian, i actually have very high standards for a Poutine.  My US girlfriend has called me out on it a few times.  The curds have to be right, if it's not melted enough, or not from proper producer, it's just not good.  The fries also can change the whole thing.  And the gravy, if it's not a dark gravy i don't fuck with it.  Also, like others have said, the curd comment is passable because of ranking, im sure if it was an A tier there would be tons of people trying to educate.
Brazilians national language is portuguese
you are missing more than 160 nations
Y’all make fun of Americans for not knowing countries 😭
You are missing about 185 countries lad
Wiener Schnitzel actually Test very good if you get eight good one and not touch bland shit
I find the lack of french , thai, greek, chinese, mexican, Indian, and Japanese food is disturbing
Brits literally eat pigs blood and fail to actually clean their arse and then have the audacity to say another country's dish 'looks like shit.'  Also, if the Cuban dish is filled with flavour then it definitely cannot be passed off as British 😂
lol jerk chicken is not Jamaican national dish
MATH BLASTER: SHUT UP!!!!  MATH BLASTER: WHY "[ __ ]" ADD YOUR VIDEO CC????  MATH BLASTER: WHY? MATH BLASTER: I'M INFINITE ULTIMATE ANGRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Why are so [ __ ] fat there is nothing   WHY MISSING WORD [ __ ]!!!!!  D:<
Every country ❌ 9 countries ✅
They had no clue what they was talking about 😂
Jerk chicken is not jamaicas national dish bro get yourselves some ackee and salt fish
Wow there are a lot less nations than I thought!
Kjøttkaker I brunsaus
While bulgogi is a delicious and popular dish, the national dish of South Korea is kimchi.  It’s a symbol of Korean pride and heritage.
That poutine looked horrid
as an Indonesian, Chinese fried rice is different with the Indonesian fried rice. Indonesian fried rice is more charred and sweet
I'm not Austrian but i love schnitzel and this is the worst one if ever seen with the wrong sauce and missing everything except the meat.
There are 196 countries you didn't  do all att al and I wanna bet that 90% is not made right
thought this was a recent video then basil showed up
….that’s not a poutine, guys. What the hell was that?
6:20 "the flavour is too much" is the most british food complaint ive ever heard
Kilode? Well done Wilne🇳🇬
Jerk chicken is not Jamaicans national dish
Fun fact the national dish of the Isle of Man is chips cheese and grave but a ton more cheese
Why do British people have that ugly mullet now?

Do more of these
I spent my whole 9 min watching this video thinking that you would eat egypt's national dish
3:05 no way yall eating rice with a FORK, im persian and this is offensive
"the flavor was too much"
Indonesia Represent!😎🇮🇩
Chip shouldn't feel bad about getting the capital of Brazil wrong. Rio was the capital of Brazil from 1763-1960. Brasilia is a brand new city, only built in 1960.  I grew up thinking Rio was still the capital.
Who gave these guys feijoada with no rice no couve no farinha no spice and no oranges!!! thats just the fucking beans lolllll
As an Austrian: that ain‘t Schnitzel, that’s a crime against humanity.
Stopped watching as soon as he got the capital of Brazil wrong. Dumb ass
how Will gets the na in nasi correct but pronounce si as z gets me
I went to Brazil 9 years ago and still crave feijoada at least once a month.
what do you even mean "Every country" you guys didn't even hit half :D
That is not Jamaican national dish
That’s the worst looking poutine I have ever seen and they said it’s still a S tier 😂
Btw it's "poutine" not "poo-teen".  I really don't know how that became the common way for people to pronounce it because even if you read it as if it was English, that's not how it would sound at all.
The guys aren’t the smartest are they
Empanada pronunciation was horrible
As an Ethiopian 🇪🇹, the sour bread is supposed to pair well with the soup on top (wat) and absorb the soup’s flavor making the dish balanced, and there are many different wats so I reckon you guys try them all and rank them lol
man said jollof is like biriyani what a violation, biriyani is top tier, jollof is like our tomato rice
3:47 nasi goreng 🎉 my favourite
Jamaica national dish is not jerk chicken
9:12 P0RN MUSIC  ?
Oh my sweet babies Jerk chicken is not our National dish 😭😭
The production teams like "don't worry we'll get a shot of the dish AFTER you're done eat it"
They got jamaica wrong
All the countries....
Jamaica's national dish is not jerk chicken
ITS CHIPS gotta love british people
Chip always looks like his breath stinks
No one eats Schnitzel with Butter that way, get it right and I will accept the criticism lol
missed out on not trying baltic dishes
empanadas are argentinian btw y'all just had the one they usually eat in chile (plus the spaniards stole it and claim it's theirs)
The Best way to say you are english, is to look at poutine and say "that's a proper dish". The more Brown The food, The merrier
Do Belize next time!
Chip left his brain at home 😭 it's such a no thinking video... Also Will, national dish doesn't mean every citizen likes that thing
indonesia mentioned 😱😱😱
ah man i guessed beforehand that you would rate nasi goreng a B AND I WAS RIGHT LMAO
James and chip both have that slightly grimey look
Do mansaf
Fake James drinking prime was the most gross thing about this video
U should of tried a polish dish I think u would of liked polish
British people ranking/reviewing any other food than their own gruel is so funny to me. "Too much flavor."
As a Canadian I eat way too much poutine
As a Canadian, please don’t compare us to our neighbours. WE’RE NOT FAT.
As a Nigerian girly; Jollof rice being A teir is everything ❤ even though that particular one looked bland 😭
if austria is D tier, the UK won't even make the list 🤣
BRING BACK JIM
That is not…l traditional poutine
Bro I hate it when people call fries "chips" 😭😭😭
I can’t believe they ate the empanadas without their hands 😢
7:11 cool runnings
im not taking any taste opinions from people who drink prime
why is there a homeless man in the studio?
Leon bailey 🎉🎉🎉
Ah yes Poutine I've been to Canada and it was lovely, you can make in England with Fries, Chicken Gravy ans Mozzarella you can have it with chicken or Fish Fingers
Thats not even jamaica's national dish are u dumb willne???
Every country bruh what a joke
Poutine being s tier is the maddest ting ever
That poutine looked horrendous
I can't believe the guy said "that's too much flavour for me" 😮😮😮😮 and the ignorance. Turned me off the channel
Pretty sure saltfish and ackee is Jamaica’s national dish
I thought that Chip feller was attractive until I noticed he ate like a 6 year old. Massive ick.
James?
What happened to the other 185 countries' national dishes? Or does WillNE think there's only 10 in the world?
Chip eating canadas face first killed me hahaha
Leave it to the British 😂😂😂 Jerk chicken is not our national dish it’s ackee and salt fish
hate to say it mate but I think there are more countries than that
jerk chicken is not the national dish of Jamaica
RAAAHHH CANADA IN S TIER WTF IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING??? ‼️💯💯💯‼️🗣️‼️💯🗣️🔥🔥🔥💯‼️🗣️
Thanks YouTube recommended… Being Canadian and a lover of poutine, That was a really sad looking poutine.
you cant judge schnitzels by eating a microwaved piece of  deepfried cardboard
I thought Bob Marley was from Brixton London aka Robert Nesta Marley oh by the way is father was a part of the English army i5 from Chester UK 🇬🇧
1:45 no its not like english food at all sicne its not shit
Ethiopia in C tier is BLASPHEMY Clearly that Doro Wat is not well-made
..james.....james       james
as an indonesian, honestly idk what r u yapping about will. u might saying it in bahasa, but i can't even catch a single words mate.
The issue is that this food is cooked in the UK 😫
missed out on bare countries no? america? australia?
YEAAAH CHIPPP  EMPANADAS ARE FROM ARGENTINA!!! Chile just does a shit version of them!
Not every nation
Damn James looks like he's been on crack
That was the shittest schnitzel I have ever seen
Morocco pleeeeeease. And I know couscous is considered the national dish but I would recommend chicken bastilla
Hello guys. What’s up with that ranking letter’s names? S, A, B, C, B?
U should try kushari from Egypt
Offended every country
Bro Ethiopia and D bro  And what type.of whet is on it You fr need to try Good Ethiopian food
yo
Where are the other countries?...
im from cananda and that poutine is criminal
2 things.   1. That’s not Jamaican jerk chicken   2. Our National dish is ackee and salt fish   🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Part 2!
As a half Indonesian and a singaporean I’m not mad when he say is Indonesia in Thailand😭 because I get that a lot when people say is Singapore in china. But did he just say he dun like Chinese 😭 we are not even Chinese nor is any similar to Chinese food 😢
Naija jollof is goated.
wonder who cooked the meals or were they got them from.
will having good table manners actually really surprised me
mans said yugoslavia??? which fell apart like 30 years ago??
That poutine looks minging, but given that it's an S tier, I'll allow it
Their pronunciation of empanada made my heart hurt 😂
Jamaica's national diss is ackee and saltfish no jerk chicken.
“Every” country…
Where is James
Jerk chicken is not jamaica's national dish.
I miss jimbo
is Thailand in Indonesia?
Ethiopian food is so good!!!!
WHO the fuck did that schnitzel nahh butter wtf also it’s veal not fucking haram oink oink
to say a schnitzel tastes bad you never had a good one
part 2 is needed boys
3:38 Yugoslavia fell apart 30 years ago 💀
indonesian here, i don’t even know what he was saying it’s just a bunch of random words.. “give me that package i want the key” ??
Will i love you but the national dish of jamaica🇯🇲 is ackee and saltfish. U can eat it alone or pair it with rice, breadfruit or jamaican fried dumpling etc. Love to see u do this video again be more accurate.
Jamaica being high B is criminal😭😭😭
Bro's cutting his food with a spoon
Fries are from belguim cheese is from the netherlands
Brazil dish is not feijoada, is just a big side dish, feijoada is way different... it still with feijão....
Not having an Indian flag in a YouTube thumbnail even if it's not in the video is a crime
idk guys, as a canadian, that poutine was looking kinda dodgy….. and as a somali who grew up eating ethiopian food, i can see how injera can be an acquired taste😭😭
ethiopia D tier is mad
Ethiopian is great
Being Canadian has me absolutely gassed to see you put poutine in S tier…then Chip humbles us by saying “no wonder these lot are so fat” 🙃
chip really is just baldrick from blackadder
Feijoada is definitely above B tier. Its one of my favourite dishes and I'm not brazilian btw yet its so simple. You literally just had the beans. You are meant to eat it with rice. Try it with rice and it will blow your mind lol
I dont usually comment. But when i do is to tell people that yugoslavia doesnt freaking exist anymore 🤦‍♀️
Schnitzel is class. But that looked terrible
I'm still waiting for love island all star even if its ended
Cheese curds doesn't just mean melted cheese btw, what ever you guys just ate was definitely not poutine, cuz cheese curds are like the key ingredient and you guys didn't have it.
bring back Twoti
Yugoslavia gang
Should do the pacific islands. Samoa, Fiji and Tonga hahaha
“Cheese curds which is just melted cheese” the Canadian was too stunned to speak
Damn I really had hope that’s he’d actually eat every country’s national dish and then I saw that the videos 9 minutes long 😔
Fun fact: Britain’s national dish is chicken tikka masala
You gotta do Iran, easy S tier
Chip leaves a trail of food behind on the table every time😂😂
That schnitzel looked dead you gotta have an actual schnitzel
As an Austrian, that Schnitzel is horrifying.
bring in nepalese food with some daal bhat set and momos then we're talking. You'll have to create a G tier for greatness
You have to eat feijoada with rice 😅 oh my days 🫨
Feijoada it's better without the meat, it makes feijoada a kinda heavy meal
Naaaaahhh Schnitzel is brilliant....im from Malta not even Austrian or German and love it. You just got a shit one buddy. I recckon it would have been A tier if you got a good one
Jollof isn't eaten with a sauce. Coleslaw at best
This should be main channel son
Where is Australia
lol where’s Indian food?
you should've got Lebanese food
The „Schnitzel“ is just full on offensive to any Austrian 🥲
Every nation, what are there only 9 countries lol
wheres james maaaan
From Chile, the sauce applied to empanadas is called 'pebre.' It is made from tomato, onion, garlic, chili pepper and cilantro, seasoned with salt to taste, and vegetable or olive oil. Good video!~
You guys butchered austria here. The Wiener schnitzel was missing some key opponents
This is the most awful poutine I’ve ever seen, you put that in S tier, having the real thing you’d need a higher tier
Watching you raw dog that feijoada with no rice, farofa or oranges is horrendous
Jamaica's national dish is Ackee and Saltfish guys😅
Asutria will declare war on the UK  for calling that thing a wiener schnitzel..
Wiener Schnitzel is S tier but you just ate the worse Schnitzel in existence
You didn't get the schnitzel from the right place if you didn't like it. A good schintzel is easily S tier, argue with a wall
Ain’t no way y’all have jerk chicken for Jamaica national dish 😂. It’s ackee and salt fish 😅
had to rewatch 4:23 multiple times to understand what will said because his accent was something else HAHAHA😭😭😭😭😭
that is the saddest, most vile schnitzel i've ever seen 💀
Enpanadas are from Argentina…
Try Estonian national dish someday if possible :)
Good thing these guys made it on YouTube cause they're thick af 😅
James we want James 🫡
BRO THE SCHNITZEL WHAT EVEN WAS THAT
me when you mention nasi goreng as i am EATING nasi goreng… 😮
Feijoada is usually served with many things like rice, farofa, mandioca, and kovi. We need justice for Brazil 🇧🇷💚💛💙
feijoada with rice is S tier
‘Every’ country 🤥
BASIL?
3:45 "is thailand in indonesia" 🤦🤦
Shouldve tried dutch ‘boerenkool’
Bejng an adult and not liking veggies is crazy
I'm not austrian AND vegetarian but the fact you put Wiener Schnitzel in D is just wrong
Nahh chip isn‘t a man for great cuisine 😂😂
Love 🇮🇩
As a fellow austrian that schnitzel was a CRIME!
What about South Africa bruh?
CANADA LESSSSGOOOOO
Nah putting jerk chicken in B is actually an insult and I’m not Jamaican, I just know how hard it goes
Not watching this cause no James 😢
Proof British people have taste buds of a 7 year old since poutine for them is S tier 😂😂 it's just potato, cheese and gravy smh
chip is such a w
Jamaicas national dish is ackee and saltfish not jerk chicken
Mix the bulgogi together for gods sake
That poutine was sad
There is a difference on the poutine part, cheess curds are different from melted cheese ❤ love ya will, from Canada ❤❤
These mullet type hairstyles are shit 🤣
How do you not like one vegetable that’s the hottest take here
Hate from Ethiopia
W canada
Jerk Chicken isn't the national dish. it's Ackee and saltfish
We have different types of poutines in Canada. My favourite is pulled pork poutine
WHAT is this Schnitzel? Who did the research for you? Nobody dips it in butter!
The spongy "trypophobia" thing in ethiopias dish is cow stomach
Jerk chicken is not Jamaicas national dish you have now been cancelled will
Nice  guys,thanks  for the score for the Nigeria  jollofrice
smh I’ve been lied to this whole time. I should’ve known that there were only 10 countries in the world :(
I like watching these types of videos but, jerk chicken? Jamaica's national dish?!  Wat a sinting. Also, surprisingly good patois! Better than me honestly.
The schnitzel is just a plain parmo served like fried fish with lemon
jamaicas national dish is ackee and salt fish😐
Who's that better be as awkwardly not funny and kinda funny as well like Jimbo is
Should've had Ćevapi or Pljeskavica from Serbia
Ware was james he loves his food ❤😂
will and chippo in their gordon ramsay era 👨‍🍳
anjaiii
9:48 who the fuck cooked that thing??????? that is NOT what schnitzel looks like. digraceful
Another video where Will proves that he is the most southern northerner ever
Is that memeulous
will cerfited foodie
You and Chip look like you go to the same barbers, do you get friends discount. Interesting content video kept me on the edge of my seat keep it up you rapscallion
It's so ironic when Chip says "no wonder they're all fat over there" while referring to Canada's poutine, I swear England has consistently scored higher than Canada in the worldwide obesity ranking loool
I love how they say "Cant belive it hasnt come from us", about the Poutine. Hope you fellas are aware that most Canadians still see themselves as British.
Where’s the pyramid pls bring it back
YEAH W FOR CANADA
HE’S BACK!
feijoada is a lot better with rice but it's not for everyone and varies a lot
You didn’t rate every countries national dish tho did you …
What's crazy is that looks like the worst poutine I've ever seen and they still thought it was good enough for S tier. Poutine stays on top boys
Hello there mate
He does look like a bloke who doesn't eat veg tho doesn't he
Thank The Gods Boring James Wasn't In This. Chip Is A Better Co-Host 👍🏻
You couldn't get the actual national dish for Jamaica? It's ackee and saltfish, not fucking jerked chicken jfc
Will’s a massive comfort watch
Opinion on Gabe itches?
USA are fat ! But no we are not fyi !
I was really surprised they hated the ethiopian food so much because i actually just had that dish for the first time too a few weeks ago and it was fucking incredible
Bruh, Jamaica's national dish is not jerk chicken its ackee and saltfish.
Wtf is that cheese on the poutine?! Its not supposed to be melted. I'd still eat it tho
Where is peru
indonesia is cheat code on youtube
Think you might have missed a couple countries
you need to try Carne asada!! from Nicaragua. BTW carne asada is a full meal not just grilled steak lol
How is this every country? And can we get a ‘brother count’ 🤭
that is not feijoada ahahha
That is not Jamaica national dish
chips great but i want james back tyvm
Not milking James for content everybody stop this is impostorNE
Crazy how British people judge food
It’s giving 💅
What good have the Austrians done? Other than Mozart, and Psychoanalysis lol
He's drinking prime i dont trust his taste buds.
As an Indonesian, it look like a low quality nasi goreng to be fair
Missed portugal :(
I hate disliking a will video but I hate chip why couldn’t basil do this video with him instead???!
Videos way too short
We want James not that pedo! 😡 😠
EVERY country is a big stretch
I don't know if he pick jerk chicken just to piss Jamaicans off but it's pretty F-ed up in my opinion.
The Isle of Man made our version of chips cheese gravy
chip > james
Cmon big up chile, aguanteeeee
This video is really historically accurate, with the british guys claiming half the dishes as "100% british food"
Lithuania would be S or A tier
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Bariis and hilib???
James lost some weight
James looks a bit weird
You should have gotten ciaran on for this one. He loves his food.
Chip looks like James' skeleton
chip is me trying anything i don’t usually eat
New love island coming you and James need to watch it
WHEN IS THE NEXT TWOTI?
Why did James get funny so suddenly
New vid yay!!
nossa mas comer a feijoada sem arroz, farofa e couve é um crime
Jamaica's national dish is NOT jerk chicken...
Learnt that Will is a foodie, love that.
Leon Bailey mentioned UTV
Don’t let the French hear you call poutine English lol
I always knew chip was a 13 year old boy that guy don’t eat nothin. He looks like a chicken nuggets and chips sort of bloke
That poutine looks criminal though 😂
The dog 😂
Needs a part 2 will mate
I don’t know if u remember but if u go into your love island reacts series james owes u money because u lot made a bet saying if Ekin Su and davide broke up James would give u ££££ and if they didn’t u would give James £££££ and well they broke up!
That 100% wasn’t a Schnitzel that was just some pork breaded off Tesco with some butter on the side
I am sure he is lovely but Chip has 0 camera presence and I am actively put off the video
Where’s the maccies vid?
Almost impossible, BUT, you made it. You ARE as dumb as you look. Well done!!
James looks a little different today, new skincare?
austrias is like a parmo without the good bits
When will you review the rest of the country’s that exist😂
Ozempic has really done a job on James.
Empanadas are also from Argentina.
Canadian here! Cheese curds are just little chunks of cheese. They all melt the same as its cheese, but curds refer to the lil bits of it before it melts
That's not a Chilean empanda, at least not a traditional empanada de pino 🇨🇱 8:09
We gonna ignore that Yugoslavia doesnt exist anymore🤔
PORTUGAL NEXT ????
I cant believe you ate feijoada without rice, farofa and torresmo, that's what makes the FULL feijoada!
Can’t lie this was a hard watch….. the lack of knowledge about bob Marley is sickening
ofc canada is s tier. also cheese curds aren’t just melted cheese it’s a typa cheese ❤️
Ummm Will Jamaica's national dish is not jerk chicken. Its ackee and saltfish.
They should rename this video, northern man likes chips cheese and gravy
no james, no like
Can’t stand chip, he was so proud to say he doesn’t eat vegetables
A British person claiming the food from Cuba seems like something they’d make is so wild lmaoo
They did the ethio doro wat dirty 😂 didn’t even taste the stew 😢
is thailand in indoesia damn chippo
Just casually put the wrong national dish. Probably because they knew they wouldn't eat ackee
how did it take 3 people to answer the question 'is bob Marley Jamaican?'
Chip is the wrong person for this..
we want the return of the marriott
Is it just me, or did they upload this video a couple weeks ago?
A video of lunch is scraping the barrel will.
That is the single least Canadian poutine I’ve ever seen 😂
You missed the best chance to make James eat schnitzel. So disappointed... jk good vid
omg we havnt seen davide in so long!
how can you be a grown ass man and not like a single vegetable..
The way both of my countries don’t exist in Will’s mind has me on my knees 😔
Good video! Need a part two with other countries.  Also, I don't think you realise how controversial calling Nasi Goreng Indonesian could be 😅 It's a disputed dish that many people from South East Asia get very passionate about.
Please do wales (but don’t have chip because it is basically vegetables and soup
What the hell did you do to that poutine
This "chip" character is just a skinny lispy mullethead who lacks a jawline. Particularly grim because he drinks Prime.
WILL ITS BEEN A MONTH WHERE HAVE U BEEN (welcome back bro)
Jerk chicken isn't Jamaica's national dish, by the way 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
MAKE ANOTHER PART
fkn hell will that was a bad one 86k views🙈
Basil is so adorable! Poutine IS really damn good!! ❤from Ontario 🇨🇦 . You should try Newfie Fries.
missed you will
No shot British people telling others culture’s their food looks like dig poop in the first minute 😂 bro look at your food
Jim's looking pretty thin today
Wasn’t worth the wait
I will tell you after a good few rounds of drinks, a poutine is god tier drunk food lol
as an argentinian i would like to say that empanadas are from argentina, they stole the credit beacuse the chile people don't have a national dish of their own.
Y‘all gotta try a real Schnitzel at some point, that shit looked like a piece of cardboard. And who the fuck dips Schnitzel in butter
They did the schnitzel wrong😭🙏
Brazil feijoada is the fake feijoada the real one and best one is Portuguese
Please try feijoada again on your free time when you can. With rice, farofa, kale - that's the complete dish and it's very comforting
James looks thin
In what world is that a schnitzel?
As a chilean I must say, we are the best country of Chile.
Love chip
The fact that Poutine got S tier makes me proud 😂
That wiener schnitzel was a crime, the person who made that needs to stay far away from the kitchen. That shit is giving wiener schnitzels a bad name.
I miss you
Did James lose some weight and turn Pakistani or am I missing something
I’m so glad Will liked the poutine! I’m not a poutine girlie myself but seeing him like the one good thing my absolutely shite country has to offer made me smile 😂
Will saying nasi goreng is a more chinese version of fried rice got me fked upppp💀💀💀💀
Missed these videos!!
I cant belive james wasnt here to eat a schnitzel (if you know you know)
Here for the angry Brazilians
That is a Food Crime..  That is not a Poutine.. Also, Cheese Curds are not just "melted cheese"....  Try the real thing. 100x better.
canadians stole cheesy chips and gravy and gave it a goofy name to convince themselves they’d actually made something
Honestly the worst video you have made to date, clickbait title, food with no likeness to the National dish and you didn’t even bother to try every counties you just went off what delivered in Uber eats range  Come on will your better than this
The Canadians are now quaking. Cheese curds are NOT just melted cheese.
that was not the jamaican national dish it is ackee and saltfish
I h8 the Tories
As a Canadian, I couldn't be prouder!!!!
jerk chicken is so good. s tiers of all s tiers
Ackee and saltfish is Jamaicans National dish not jerk chicken couldn't y'all like research that
as the resident Jamaican, that ain't our national dish but its good tho. Can't go wrong with Jerk Chicken.
that is not poutine
As an Indonesian, that Nasi Goreng looks awful lmaooo
Canada ranking the best is amazing, up the poutine eh
Getting a national dish wrong is disappointing. Getting Jamaica national dish wrong is sad. So many Jamaicans in the UK
Thrilled to see this first thing in the am
“Every country” is a bit of a stretch Will
As a chilean thats the weirdest empanada i ve seen in my life jajaja
Jamaican does not have jollof rice it has rice and peas which are completely different
I'm German and I definitely need an apology video with a proper Schnitzel. That was a very sad excuse of a Schnitzel..
fidel castro was great man
Not our national dish 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
The personal training is really paying off James
As a Jamaican before anyone come at them for not eating ackee and salt (our actual nation dish) instead of jerk chick remember that it can mess you up if not cooked properly
Inject the Austrian tears
No James. I like
will uploads on his second channel:😃 James is not in it: 😥
Definitely would watch this as a series
Chip said ooo Jollof I had this a lot in Jamaica🤯🤯🤯🤣🤣
That poutine made my toes curl 😭
CHILE MENTIONED🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
he's back!
CHILE MENTIONES RAHHH🇨🇱🇨🇱
5:35 you know it tastes bad when you use prime to get rid of the taste
Will needs to try bhutans national dish ema datshi
Poutine being in S tier makes me happy
Empanadas are from Argentinaa !!!
So white
i love how for chile they got: 1. not the national food 2. the kind of empanada that is not, in fact, from chile 3. as someone from the country those empanadas ARE from, I'll still take it. obligatory somos el mejor país de chile
Unpopular opinion: chip > james
As an indonesian, i don’t got a clue on what will was saying
Surely this says more about the skill of the chef(s) responsible (or their lack thereof) to properly reproduce these national dishes so that they both look and taste as they should than it does about the dishes themselves.  You might still love/hate the dishes even when done properly of course, but some of the dishes presented here clearly weren't even close to how they were supposed to be, so the ranking really belongs to the chef(s). Regardless of that then I look forward to seeing the next 27 or so episodes of this series ... assuming that the title isn't as misleading as some of the dishes were ...
Wow canada finally s in something 😂 add bacon even better
That not jamaicas national dish it’s akcee and salt fish
Just wait until you test the Swedish “meatballs”
Will eating an empanada with a fork is an abomination
You know the amount of times I’ve heard about poutine and never realised it was just cheesy chips and gravy, a British dish you get from the boss man at 3am
brother
How is that man over 8 years old and he won’t eat his veggies…   Imagine you go out on a date with a girl and you go to a fancy restaurant but you don’t eat any of the veg, you are going home alone
Is Bob Marley Jamaican 🙄
Poutine is my favourite dish ever. Canada rocks
No way, a video that hasn't been deleted 10 minutes after publishing!
hearing will try and pronounce 'bulgogi' has to be my favourite thing today
As a Jamaican living in Jamaica, there is no jollof rice in Jamaica 😂, also jerk chicken is not the national dish, a bit disappointed here boys
jamaican food should be number 1
More of this, sick duo. Very chill to watch
Ofc Jamaica is chicken 😭
will toto wolff eats the schnitzel thing for lunch every day,,,
we want jimbo ‼️
I hereby invite Will to Austrian to personally cook a proper Schnitzel for him. What they got was fried pork in cheap oil. It should be veal battered with egg, flour and then breadcrumbs. Gently fried in claryfied butter, with potatoes as a sidedish and cranberry jam.
Jamaican national dish is ackee&saltfish NOT JERK CHICKEN!!!!
james has lost a bit of weight
Will, did you know that there are 197 countries in the world?
I'm Austrian, and that Schnitzel was a disgrace. I'm sure if they had tasted a proper one, it would have been rated much higher.
Why the fuck would you get chip, perhaps the fussiest eater in the entire world, on for a good video 💀
If you replaced will with James this video would he goated
ummm i didnt see bosnia on this list
Nasi goreng is literally fried rice 😂
A ten minute video. Are you serious???!
very proud day to be a canadian! that poutine didnt look too good tho. maybe try some better poutine you will be amazed
I agree with all of theses choices poutine is 100% SS
Why does will keep saying brother because that’s not his brother is it?
Jamaican National dish is ackee and salt fish. Combine with the fact that chip makes racist jokes, it’s not a good look that you don’t know certain countries National dishes
Bring back jamessss
HE’S BACK! 🎉
I only came to watch this 4-1 reason will
*The English DARE talk about Americans for our "geography" but they constantly show their worldly ignorance. Yikes!*
Chip doesn't know that a potato is a vegetable
I dont know where y'all get your info from... but Jamaica's national dish is Ackee and Saltfish...Not jerk chicken 🇯🇲🇯🇲
26145th
I bet Finland would've been A tier.
missed will uploads fr
Gotta see a part 2 with Australia
"Every country" - 7 countries
the amount of countries in the world has dropped quite a bit i see
wow james looks the exact same !! the haircut didnt change 😋
the way will said empanada hurt me
jerk chicken is not yards national dish kmt😭😭
lets go will! another badly performing video!!
Chip is so much better than that puff you usually have
There are more.coubtries. this title is clickbait
Heck ya go canada
It’s not just no veg - Will getting flash backs of the sheer amount of pharmaceuticals chips taken
9:11 this is where james would’ve mentioned how he gaslight his fans
Surprises me how will just doesn't seem to really know things? Like I don't know does he not read or anything? Also Cheese curds doesn't mean melted cheese it's the curds... From cheese. And it's a meat gravy rather than just like bisto
🗣WILLS BACK I REPEAT WILLS BACK🗣
is wilne gonna end up as big as harry was soon
Will loving nasi goreng is top teir for me fr 🇮🇩
Will saying Jimbo Mazza carries these videos is sweet
Is”brother” your new word of the day
Wow James looks so different without his glasses
Team Canada 🇨🇦
Jamaicas national dish is Ackee and salt fish not jerk chicken …. 🇯🇲🇯🇲
Wasn’t chip friendly with Andrew Tate? I remember them making an instagram post about how they had to delete his podcast episode. How unfortunate that is and that they would love to have him on again. I don’t think I misinterpreted something but please let me do if I did. But personally I wouldn’t want to have someone who agrees with Tates views (besides the fact that the man is a literal criminal) on your channel.  Edit: it’s on the fellas insta 4th of January post. They’re literally saying they don’t see a problem with him, just took it down bc they didn’t want to be on bad terms with Spotify.  This can’t be supported.
We want James!
Fe-sh-oh-wah-dah
Butchered Feijoada😂😂😂 should of eaten it with white rice at least
A well-made wiener schnitzel is top tier 👌
As an Austrian I am offended by the dish that was served because that was NOT a full traditional Wiener Schnitzel, who dunks it in butter?! O_O
i think james changed his hair
I see James has a new trim
3:38 bro Yugoslavia ain’t a country anymore
2 sexy men
You need to continue this and do literally every country with chip
Really hoping there’s a part 2 in this, I was just settling in!
I think maybe you missed one or two countries
jimbo lost some waight
Chip: “is Thailand in Indonesia”
No egypt  Dislike
Wtf have you been, Mr. William Lenney?! Thrilled you're back though!!
Ethiopian food actually bangs
What the hell is that schnitzel...
Jim looks a bit different!
chippo lad
Jamaican in B tier?! That is criminal 😂
Nah this ain’t it will, we need a pt 2
We’re chip proof🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
This tier list might be the first one I completely agree with, no notes
Nah bro that’s Majes Jariott
That is the worst schnitzel i have ever seen
you didnt even make a wiener schnitzel
You lot getting the shittiest schnitzel ever made and then complaining is insane
feijoada is a lot better with rice but it's not for everyone and varies a lot
Looks like dump 😂😂😂😂😂
Get a better co host. He's trying too hard tbh
Curry goat is the Jamaican Goat
Ah it’s you. We want James Marriot back please
I like James’ new haircut 😁
petition to bring back james
that isnt jamaicas national dish... its ackee and saltfish. additionally ackee is the countries national fruit
Something about James looks different in this video, can’t put my finger on it tho.
The atrociousness of your Geography skills. Making us Brits look bad
That schnitzel take was horrible
try poland ❤
Alternate title: Will trying to fight the 'British food is bad' allegations
Saddest nasi goreng I’ve ever seen in my whole life
Finally he’s back
Damn only 10 nations left in the world? RIP to all the other over 200 nations.
Finally
3:35 if you think Nigerian jollof is good you should try ghanian jollof. It is in every way better.
Omg I'm so early
Chip is a weird way to say JAMES
The amount of countries willne doesn’t recognize is astonishing
