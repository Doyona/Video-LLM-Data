I love him
One of the best football players in the world

Mo🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬
The Egyptian Cesar 🤴
Chelsea all the way
the other day i saw all of salah's premier league goals on youtube. the next day against bournmouth he missed a penalty hahaha
👍
مش قولنا نبطل حوارات كتير في أوقات غلط. هو ده اللي بيخرجه عن تركيزه. وبعد ما كان في قمة فورمته بعد ماتش المان يونايتد، راحوا خسروا قدام آخر الجدول بورنموث، وصلاح ضيع ضربة جزاء!
Moooo <3
1:06 is that a woman's sound?
This aged well 💀💀💀
From pple saying he never scored against united to completely owning them.
i remember my scream after the goal against chelsea, even as a non-liverpool fan, i was amazed and delighted
1 season wonder...  Should be used as a compliment from now on
Guessed it right even before knowing the contenders. It was easy to guess though.
صلاح اللي مشرفنا عند الانجليز
Eden hazard should do this
The Man U and Chelsea goal should be on the final 2
top class

Well this sure didn't age well.
"I name it Dave. Dave the Goal"
The goat
moch sallah is thebest
For me the Chelsea goal was the Best...
best player ever
اتمنى التواصل مع مو صلاح
اتمنى التواصل مع محمد صلاح

🎉👑🎂

Greatest right winger in pl history
Then he missed a penalty against Bournemouth!! Overated.  Ian Rush is a true Reds legend.
😂Please interview him on ultimate penalty miss against Bournemouth too
Mohamed Salah, the son of my country, I wish you success, and we support you from the bottom of our hearts. Long live my son Salah ⚜️🇪🇬⚜️🇵🇸
Ultimate  difficulty!!!!🤗🤗🤗
How about that penalty miss today against Bournemouth? That was one to never forget.
Obviously special for a Liverpool player to score against Utd. Good for him.
And then "fans" says he suck after a few games with unluck or bad oerformance.. LOL He is the best we ever had!!!!!
Mo Salah's manners impress me a lot
The guy has been poor for over a season n half,  just look at the goals hes scored,  penalties n easy tap in, he needs to be dropped
Maybe he should name the ultimate miss penalty against Bournemouth.
What an honour to sit down with the legend and talk through his greatest PL goals. One of the nicest guys I’ve ever met!
I absolutely love the goal against Chelsea..
Should have put the Chelsea and Man City goals on opposite sides.
King Salah.. love from Bangladesh 💖🇵🇰
Mo Salah's greatness and uniqueness lies in the fact that he is not only the best winger of all time in the English Premier League, or that he is one of the best scorers or players in the history of that great league. In two different ways, this man came with his dreams and was able to bring together the peoples of the two civilizations who are far from each other for fear of each other, to be an example here and an example there, so that many people can listen to each other through him.
Best Winger in prem history without a doubt. Most people will say Ronaldo based on what he achieved with Madrid outside of the PL
He should go to Arsenal if he wants to win the league anymore.
The Egyptian king🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬
He's great and a stat padder. If he played well, we would have won 4 PL titles
Haters will always hate
The one against Man City, I still can’t believe that happened. Messi does that against Madrid we don’t stop hearing about it ..
one season wonder so they said hahahaha
Can't believe they used to clown him for not scoring vs United lol now he is their worst nightmare
wish you'd focus more on the technique as well. I would love to hear what he thinks of that Puskas goal, the push, the turn and the finish.
damn he writes with his right hand?
Salah is having his worst seasons and still his numbers are on par with Rashford who's having his best season. 😂
what a face and what an accent, fuck
The true goat 🐐
Mo is left footed but writes with his right? 🤔
Best winger in EPL history !! A legend and has records that will be very hard to beat !! A very humble and down to earth guy and that is so special … luv Mo
To me, the goal where he cancelled Cancelo and had Pep on his knees was the best ever.
Notice how sky will never post stuff about players when they’re in a drop of form, only when they’re in form. Contributes to the negativity that players get when having a bad patch.
The Egyptian King
الملك الافريقي
Amazing Salah❤
shoot kaki kiri,..tulis tngn kanan...handal
Amazing Salah
Best winger in premier league history.
And after a week of getting racist abuse from the “small minority” of Chelsea fans . Wonderful.
King👑🇪🇬
The best winger in Prems history
👑❤️🐐
The beauty of man city goal it that after all squeezing and dribbling it was still very tight angle
His goal against Man City is the most beautiful ever
wish you showed normal tv angles as well
Best player in the world
The goal against city watchin tht live was just out of the world ... had to see the replay to understand more   happened so fast 🫡
Alot of Mo Salah Goals is An ART
Best winger in the world for the last 6 years and it's not even close
The Egyptian king 👑
العالمي ❤️
Chelsea fans must be tearing their hair out seeing salah doing what he's doing at liverpool
Mo Salah 👑💖👑 ابن بلدي
The footage of the goals is awful can barely see whats going on
Jurgen Klopp signed Mo Salah for the aim of killing Man United.😂😂😂
Salah yang tidak selalu salah
I'm Egyptian I love Mohamed Salah ♥️👑 أهدافك بتقشعرنى وبتمنا من ربنا ان اقبلك 🥲
Salah not good but anfield is good
Salah 🔥🔥🔥
Salah goals with Peter Drury's commentary on it is what i would die for!!!!
Clear of hazard
Mohamed Salah is my favorite player
I don't know why?    I hate this man.  He is like pretending.   Not only me all my friends
Salah really hates those 2 Manchester's club
better goals than Rolando any day of the week
Even as a city fan I was in awe of this man after that solo goal.
Maybe he's not gonna be top scorer this season, obviously Haaland will have it but nonetheless his stats makes him one of the best in The PL, love Salah!!
I loved his goal against Roma that was a sick curler
mohamed salah
The solo goal against city is always the best. A truly gift from God
1:19 is not the same season and like other one😭😭the jerseys are literally different
City goal because because he did it under pressure
Man City ❤
I believe that Salah is still our best player.
Mo Salah My Favourite Goal Against Chelsea
Imagine being Salah and seeing yourself score all these goals and reach these milestones. Be honestly, these guys don't care too much. It's always about the next game, the next goal, the next trophy. Then, at the end of their careers, they can finally enjoy all these wonderful times.
Crazy that Liverpool bottled half of these games 😭😭 Salah needs a new team so his moments of brilliance don’t go wasted 👌
KING
Loved this!  Great host also
This guy is very humble and Liverpool history will mention for generation ahead his name as one of the greatest players ever , I love his personality and talented skills
I can see mosalah in Saudi Arabia league next 5 year.. following ronaldos path.. with more follower in mosalah socmed. If he keep humble and be influental in world issue especially social and religion issue
LOL and Haaland is going to smash Salah's goalscoring record in PL out of the park.
Right handed, left footed
We all know that page is framed in this guy's house.
I'm a United fan but Salah to me is an Egyptian modern day Pharaoh, the greatest African player ever, even better than Weah even though Salah hasn't won the ballon dor, he is still the African Egyptian king.
Man that playstation goal vs City❤️🔥
Wait, Salah’s right handed?
So many great goals, resulting a new competition to choose which one the best. What a player..
Easily one of of the best wingers in Premier League history! Absolute legend!
Pep should watch this till the end 🤣🤣
You know you are good when your Puskas goal isn't even one of your better goals.
5:22 Salah basically saying, stop waffling poor presenter, Ill just pick one
Do I dare say he’s had a better legacy than hazard and ronaldo in the premier league
Do I dare say he’s had a better legacy than hazard and ronaldo in the premier league
People said he was poor. He wasn't worth the money. Hes past it..... Then ask the salty mancs is he past it
🔥🔥🔥🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🤗🤗❤️
الوحش المصري ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍اخوي الغالي
People talking about Chelsea's screamer about it came out of nowhere. For me, it is the goal vs West Brom. Liverpool was 1-0 down and was lifeless on the field. Salah levelled it by a stunning strike from outside the box. I am sure that people remember this game cause Alisson's goal. As a hardcore Salah fan, I love the first goal as much as I love Alisson's goal cause how Liverpool was struggling at 0-1 and the picture of Salah looking at the ball when it was going to the net just engrave in my mind.
Really happy for Timbsy. Was the best part of Copa90
Salah GOAT
Always he takes the shirt off after scoring after certain teams 🌚… he’s a bit of a showoff against Man United 😂
He’s wrong, the goal v Chelsea was the best.
Nice
Someone gotta give Klopp's glasses back.
Fair play to timbsy interviewing salah top job!! Good to see how far you grown on YouTube   Salah is a legend YNWA 👏🏻 😁❤️
7-0
The Egyptian people are asking the World Health Organization to include Salah's goals as one of the treatments for depression 🤩🙂
صلاااااح 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
5:30 and ea dares to give him only a 3 star weakfoot come on salah desrves a 4 star weak foot at least and please update hes armband ea he doesnt wear it anymore
How much do you think that signed document is worth
Love Salah, he's so humble. He's class YNWA
🩶❤️💐👏👏👏👌❤️🩶
Now he is the new owner of Manchester United
Keep banging them in Mo and I’m more than happy to have these debates over and over again
The beautiful game becomes more beautiful with Mo Salah on the ball
Legend
Who would win,Ibrahimovich or VVD(Van Dijk)?  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Liverpool LEGEND EGYPTIAN KING MO SALAH 👑👏
Mo salaah 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Tbh his goal against Spurs is special but he is too selfish at that game..
Mr Mo since you came to Liverpool. Everytime you score n win it Feels like my Birthday 🎉🍾🍺🚬🌿. Here's to You 👏 and many more Celebrations  to come. 🎉.. And that man city Goal was Dopest. 🇿🇦RSA REPRESENTING 🤜
I think we as Egyptians have the same writing in English as mo Salah 😂😂😂🤦‍♂️
Seems that when Salah comes against Manchester x2 (both City and Utd) never humble and sympathetic😅😅😅 just to devastated on them😂😂
We can not realize What a player is , as he is still playing 🎯🔥✌
Why are captions unavailable? Poor form, PL.
Most humble football ⚽️ player, Allah bless you and your family
🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬 My son is very proud of you, my hero. A beautiful example of an ambitious Egyptian youth. When he started from zero to reach the world, you deserve all the appreciation and respect, my brother.🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬
the best ever in PL at this current rate
Thanks Mo, class player   CTID
King mo 👑🔥
Love u mo salah
Best Winger in premier league history
They say him just one season wonder
😻😻😻😻
The Egyptian King the best ever Keep going bro
viva mohamed salah viva liverpool
Salah quickly became a legend for LFC and Premier League in general. What a player. YNWA!
The goal against Spurs will forever be my favorite Salah goal! Its easy to dink in one from distance, but to leave five guys on the floor and in the end beat the goalkeeper, that is priceless!
Legend ❤❤
The balls to accept this interview, this man never seems to amaze me, weirdo.
THE EGYPTIAN KING 👑🇪🇬❤️
KING 👑
THE BEST ❤️
From a citizen,you're invincible Pharaoh Salah. Thanks for making city special
نعم نعم نعم انه محمد صلاح تاريخ ليفربول الجديد نعم نعم نعم انه فخر العرب ياسادة ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
was my fav before the video started
The host could've done better in prompting and responding to questions imo
The Roma goal was something special tho
Goat of africa and pl without doubt
Mo Salah 💙🔥🇪🇬🇯🇴💪
I loved the way Mo left the City boys on their asses as he scored, magic Mo.
A modern premier league legend. King Mo 👑
ابن بلدي🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬
mo salah💘💘💘💘
Love the respect by him to say his full name as "Mohammed Salah" and not just "Mo Salah" in the times we're living in... To give him that respect that he deserves. One season wonder they said...
Best advert for the game. Great player and a true gentleman.
Surely the goal against city: Trent to Robbo to Salah. Absolutely butchered them.
Wow Salah
شكرا صلاح thanks Salah 👍👑
egyption king
How can you choose...?
Random thought but I would love to see Sallah play on the same team with Griezmann
I agree with him city was the most special goal only it's ashamed that wasn't the winner
it's unbelayble
Saying Everton just another game sums Everton up 😆 🤣 😂
Goat mohammad salah
what's so great about this interview is that normally he's so guarded in his comments, but you can tell he was pretty excited to get into it. You love to see top athletes let their guard down a little and have fun with it; good job to the interviewer.
😮‍💨
The pl king mo 👊👊⚡
Legend 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🤝🏾💪🏾
Legendary player 🤩🤩🔥❤❤
STERLING
a goal to dream of!
Mo salah is a legend 👑🔥
It's nice to see he called him Mohamed instead of Mo. Mohamed is a really beautiful name
I’ve never celebrated anything like his Chelsea goal, absolute screamer and reminded me of the Gerrard days
ابوصلاح. فخر. العرب🇩🇿🇪🇬👑👑❤️❤️
I knew he would choose that. I would choose it as well. That goal was absolutely amazing. It had everything, power, dominance, skill and accuracy. It was complete. I never get tired of watching it. 💪
M SALAH Goal Against Chelsea oh wow thats goal is special..❤
Is that beast is ukshin king Mohamed Salah ❤👑👍🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬
1st. Against City (He scored from that angle with his right foot 🫠) 2nd. Against Chelsea. 3rd.  Against Tottenham.
Wonderful, amazing, and a legend by all accounts
I don't why I just like his style of play . Mo Salah
That City goal at Anfield deserved the Puskás more than the Everton goal in 2018
Love this for Salah ❤️ Salah Liverpool Legend 🎉  😍😍
Last weekend was a free advertisement for 7up, the drink was trending on the internet here. 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
Love this for Salah ❤️
Salah is the best player in the prem!
salah😍😍😍😍
King 👑♥️💪💪🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪 Liverpool
Salah scored another goal against watford , he dropped 3 or 4 players and hit it low and down. This is my favourite salah goal
Mohamed Salah is my favorite player in Liverpool FC he is the Best player around the world 🌎🌎🌎🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪💪💪
محمد صلاح موهبة لن تتكرر
The only goal i was waiting for Salah to choose was against Manchester City
Glad to see him pick that one. Knew it would be. Best goal ever scored imo.
The 40 od yard curler against City should have been included I think
Ethihad 2022
Mo salah … you are electric… ❤❤❤
the thumbnail is wrong, that wasn't the effect of the ball.
Mo Salah Egypt's king Mo Salah Egypt's king I love you
3:33 against Chelsea was 🚀
I still remember a comment made by one Chelsea supporter taking the mickey out of Liverpool for signing him saying 'They bought a flop to save them from thier misery hahaha' Guess who's laughing now my friend 😂😂
I hope to see him play for Manchester City 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂

Amazing video! would really love to see more of this with other top players.
how many season wonder?
Salah Liverpool Legend 🎉
Salah is more than just a legend he is true football King of the highest caliber the only problem is he makes it look so easy at times that make many people take him for granted but make no mistake only one single player in his generation can match and exceed him and that prime Lionel Messi otherwise The Egyptian King reigns supreme 🇪🇬 👑 💯  PS. My fav goal is that screamer against Chelsea and ofcourse that Messi esque against City but if I go on I could easily add five more that short list 👑
We absolutely Fell in love with him🌪️OUR 🇪🇬👑 YNWA
Best winger in epl era ❤
i hear a scouse accent in the deep end when salah speaks, I guess living 6 years in Liverpool came with its downside
Salah is class
First and foremost the guy is so so humble-never on the back pages for the wrong reason (take note Kyle 🤦🏼) like all world class players he just makes it look so so easy
SALAH THE MAGIC 😘😘🌹🌹💖💖🥰🥰♥️♥️🙏🙏👌👌👍👍💪💪👏👏✌️✌️👊👊💚💚😍😍😜😜⭐️⭐️🎁🎁⚽️⚽️🕋🕋
Mohamad Salah will with out doubt go down in history as one of the greatest players if not Thee greatest player to have ever played in a Liverpool shirt , he`s broken every record you can think of and by the time his career is over at Liverpool his Goal tally will be unimaginable.. Not only is he loved by the Players, Staff , Managment and supporters of Liverpool  Football Club he is also admired by the whole of the premier league . Can`t say I`ve ever heard supporters from any other club have anything bad to say about Mo Salah..
Ohh!!!Salah got a good handwriting he could one day become a great Doctor.
As a fan of _RIVAL CLUB_ I have to admit _INSERT STAR PLAYER NAME_ is a _INSERT COMPLIMENT_ the premier league has ever seen.  ☝🏽 feel free to use this template
Unbelievable
legend
We all have to admit… salah has been and will always be world class… a record breaker! One of the greatest we’ve seen in the premier league!
People compare him to Chelsea's Hazard, Son, sterling and Mane but Mo Salah has outperformed Toped all these mentioned player's in their best shape and aspect of the game, Truly a LIVING LEGEND ☝🏽👑🇪🇬
What an absolutely complete footballer!, and a gentleman. Y.N.W.A
🇪🇬 👑
Top player  What an incredible player
Every goal by Mo Salah was and is Amazing and I continue to watch Allll  his goals over and . Thank You Mo Salah.  YNWA
I genuinely think that Man City goal is the best goal ever scored at Anfield.
Was this before the 7-0 trashing of MU
👏🏾👏🏾🙌🙌
A goal to dream of
It's his goal and his choice. If I had to choose, I still go for his scorcher against Chelsea.
Let's have 7 mins of Silence for Man Utd fans that went to Anfield that day... an also a moment of silence for the Whole city of Manchester, the real Red is from the north and its name is LIVERPOOL !✊👊💪
فخر والله 🖤👑😍
👑
Go ahead Mo
🇪🇬👑🇪🇬
4:30 "Every time for last 3 years before, every interview I have is like, you score against everybody, only United - not yet" that quote has aged for 4 years in a hickory barrel
I just love him. cant wait to tell my kids about mo showing them these goals.
His Puskas was so undeserving
King @MoSalah LFC YNWA ❤
ابن بلادى🎉
There can be no argument stats wise about him being the greatest prem winger of all time. He is simply incredible and to think that he pretty much has only achieved all of his success in only 6 seasons. Just ridiculously good form.
Did LFC switched up the sponsor logo on the front of their jerseys to AxA from Standard Chartered ???
ايوا يا ابو مكه ياخاربها 💥💥🤍
Man city then Chelsea then spurs- that’s the top three
One season wonder, they said.
Salah 🇪🇬👑
King 👑
129 goals from a winger.  thats special. congrats mo salah
Wonderful player for Liverpool. Great to see him in form again.
Still can’t believe that Everton goal won the Puskas award, as good as it was.
I love Mo ♡
هو مفيش فيديو مترجم!؟
He’s getting that straight up on eBay
The goal against city will never be forgotten..like the bergkamp reverse spin flick goal
Always the best 👌💓
#HalaMadrid (PLANTS FLAG)
the city goal is unreal. Messi level
Salah the Egyptian king
Too many goals vs Utd 🤣👍
The BEST🏃
In my opinion if he keeps this up he is gonna retire the best forward in PL history. And probably top 3 best PL players of all time. A great player and good guy
That chelsea one will always be my fav salah goal
Salah has a very genuine, nice personality 👏
That goal against United will always be one of my favourite footballing moments ever. That was the moment we won the league. Not mathematically obviously, but that's when we finally admitted it to ourselves.
The Arabic language starts writing from right to left unlike the English language so everyone here learns to write with the right hand and this is a natural thing ....
The thing about on how unbelievable his goal against city was because eventhough city's defence so tight but he can squeeze and dribble past them and later shoot for goal as quick as possible in just a few second.
ช
The funny part early in his lfc career like he said he scored against everyone but united but over these last 3 seasons he’s been cooking united for fun
Mo Salah <3
One of the greatest players ever in the game that we have had the chance to witness🔥🙌
Best goal is against man city last season
wowwwwww 🌹🌹🌹❤🌹
Liverpool vs Manchester united
My favourite
My favourite salah from Bangladesh 🥰🥰🥰
For me, he comes the closest to Messi's playing style.
King mo ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hope he finish his career in the premier league and of course with Liverpool.. A player to be remember for generation..
very special player will relies how good when he has gone
good vid, salah seems such a chill guy
3:14 at this moment klopp can even defeat Usain Bolt 🤣
Best winger in the history in soccer ⚽
Best player to play for liverpool
You'll Never Walk Alone!!!
He writes with his right hand
The Legend mohamed salah 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️
For me my favourite Salah goal not in the premier league but in all comps was his goal against Roma in the SF 2018, i had never experienced a ucl final, i was born one year after 2005 so i missed istanbul and the technique and curl makes this goal the most satysfying for me
The king 👑♥️
🔥❤️
Not so fun fact but Salah has scored against every team he has faced in the PL but 2 teams. Nottingham Forest and Swansea City
صلاح يادولة🇾🇪🇾🇪🇩🇿🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌶️♥️
I noticed that Salah is left footed, but he writes with his right arm. I never knew he was right handed.
I’ll never forgive Lamella for cheating to earn a draw after watching one of the greatest goals on Premiership history.
Legend 👏🏻
What a legend. When he alll said and done he will be one of the greatest PL players ever
The Man City goal is one of the best ever scored, it's just that good. If aliens visit & we want to show them why we love football, you show them this goal
He himself had scored some much better goals than that Puskas Winning Goal, forget about other nominees that year, even he wouldn’t have had rated that goal as his best from the rest of that season😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Too many great and beautiful goals by the magician king, but I have to agree with him, that Man City goal displayed the pure instinct of Mo Salah in a nutshell.
Mooooo✨🙌🏻🙌🏻😍😍😍
I love him 😭😭😭
awesome player!
naaah, isnt that the one season wonder?
The Egyptian king
Mo salah The Egyptian king 👑
Egyptian king become a legend Liverpool 🤴
Allah bless you Salah.
Salahhhh
Salah left footed but writes with his right hand?! Just like Lebron writing with his left hand but shoots with his right
His goal..I mean screamer against Chelsea will always be my best of his. It came out of nowhere even tho the city goal and dismantling of their defense is technically better same with the warfare one a week later , I just love a good screamer
Salah is so cutie <3 KING
Muhammed Salah 😍😍😍
Salah and messi has no difference both are very similar ...❤️
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
His name is Mohamed and he represents it very well. Well, football is tribal and so is one's background.
host is slime!
Goat 🐐❤👑🇪🇬
Egyptian king 👑
Unreal goal that against City. Deserved winner!
city goal is a clear winner for me but i also find tottenham goal so special especially with arabic commentary
I didn't expect at all to choose Everton over Tottenham goal  I saw Tottenham Hotspur goal was massively favourable than Everton My list :  1️⃣ Mancity (dribbling) 2️⃣ Chelsea (screamer) 3️⃣ Tottenham (dribbling) 4️⃣ Watford (dribbling) 5️⃣ Manutd (solo run) 6️⃣ Watford (Messi Bayern) 7️⃣ Southampton (far distance) 8️⃣ Southampton (solo run) 9️⃣ Arsenal (solo run) 🔟 Norwich (GK & 2 Def)
The most humble Player of this generation. And will be the Greatest of all time in the premier league. This player has won everything in the premiere league.
Mo salah 🥳
even he knows it didnt deserve a puskas
I love you Mo Salah .I watch Liverpool and the Pl just to watch you.
Damn, he's right handed but left footed!!😱
Why does this video not contain a literal translation?!
Top 3 PL player of all time, and he's still going! Love the Egyptian King <3
Mohamed Salah, football player for Liverpool FC, is the pride of the Arabs, who speaks English fluently.
King the game ❤
He's set his standards so high even at 33G/A assist feels like an off season
1 Solo goal vs Watford  2 Screamer vs Chelsea 3 Alisson assisted distance run vs Manure
Who the hell picked the 1st goal? His goal when he sat 3 Watford players should be there
jika darwin nunez bisa mempertahankan konsistensi dalam mencetak gol dan bertahan lama di liverpool, bisa jadi dia bisa melewati rekor gol milik salah.
Thr craziest thing is he's missed about 4 games in all of his time with Liverpool
Wut, Salah is a right hander?!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh the Master .... Bowing down before my phone of that permanent clutch Class, literally  📲  🌎  ..
I was fan of you when you played in Basel Muhammad you deserve it all you have now man
He is already a legend! 🇪🇬👑
Mo Salah Mo Salah Running down the wings YNWA FROM NIGERIA 🇳🇬🇳🇬
I was sure he was gonna pick that City goal. It should have won the Puskas.
Manchester United were looking for Arab owners when they already have one….....
For me Chelsea was the best and the celebration too
Молодец
Should do this more often, please.
Salah 21/22 pre Afcon definitely my favorite Salah version so far (yeah i take it instead 17/18)
King ❤️🔥
ولدنا 🇪🇬 اللي مشرفنا، ربنا يوفقك ويحفظك
The King Mo Salah
Mo king
😂 He must do an interview of wich taking off his shirt goal was his best
Still better English than Harry Kane 💀💀💀💀
LOL @ bitter fans who labelled Mo a "One season wonder" LOL
Mo Salah the player that any football coach in the world wish to have
الملك المصري
PL great
I miss that younger version of Klopp though. He aged a lot in last 7 years ❤
Even as an Arsenal fan, Mohammed Salah really is SPECIAL!. Shame Chelsea didn't have the patience, its a trend with them other, eg, De Bruyne & Lukaku.
That city goal had my jaw drop. It was so good
3 GOLDEN BOOTS  BECAME liverpool's top scorer  As a winger Most consistent player of the premiere league of multiple past seasons   a winger  who outperformed strikers
Solo goal against city
Mohamed salah's goal against Man City was the best ever he scored in EPL and this was a special goal as he said 👏 👸🥇❤️
What about another Liverpool legend,Firmino?
The goal Vs City where he dropped Bernardo, dias and co
Goal vs City.....
Why does the thumbnail imply that the goal against Chelsea curled in, when it was more like an arrow.
#mohammedsalah
That worldie against Chelsea🙌🔥
My favourite player Mohammad Salah
