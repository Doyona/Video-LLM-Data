If ksi fought normally tommy would've battered him
5:16
5:17
Has anyone seen what KSI said on his video in his channel?
JJ is fkn awful. And thinks he’s so tough. I wish you would’ve chomped down on your gumshield and walked him down. You would’ve sparked him in under 2. He has no power
Ksi looking like a temu MVP with that sideways karate stance in boxing
Ksi was scared for his life.  Held every 5 seconds most refs would have deducted points for extensive clinching. And also broken it up right away, but this one didn't. He is clearly biased for ksi. Joke of a boxing match. Fury should have gotten out of it instead of allowing it. He should have known it was coming, that's all he did the entire fight. ksi sucks he isn't a real boxer these fights make a mockery of the sport.
Ksi won
Robbed...
Dont worry Tommy Fury, you won that fight
KSI got robbed
You got a point taken away and you still won   You didn’t beat KSI and Jake Paul
You lost that shi
I love you Kisi you won
Who was claiming ksi the clown has massive ko power😂
Thank foock Tommy won
W Tommy
#TeamTommyFuryalltheway
Surely tommy fury didn't deserve that win
Just shows how shit KSI is at boxing
Embarrassing

You lost
Tommy
Just goes to show.....Prime doesn't pay!
KSI won yo
Remember guys it takes two to tango and you can see tommy do the salsa while LSI was doing the jump dance
Is KSI boxing or flapping his hands like a bird 💀
Tommy Fury is So FINE ❤
Bros life is boxing and he met his match fighting a YouTuber. What a joke of a boxer
Good job tommy !
i don't know why tommy is happy because he said he was gonna knockout two youtubers ksi and jake pual and he did not do that even tho he has been boxing for his whole life and i really think he lost to ksi because of the point taken away so yeah
Lets go tomy!
You won fair and square. If any KSI fan tries berating you just remember they will be under 12 years of age
Where’s the overhand in the 1st that had you doing the Stanley leg
f all you bs ppl ksi the best he worked hard for this shit and still got robbed and he is a good boxer so f all you haters
Who’s here after KSI told his fans to come after Tommy? But in reality I’m here to congratulate Tommy and it’s sad how Ksi carries himself.
Don't let KSI get to ur head Tommy, he's just being pathetic. Best to ignore it.
Wtf is ksi's technique doing in boxing?🤣
Just came to check if KSI fans came to harass Tommy after KSI decided to break TOS.
you lost
lol JJ lives rent free in all of your heads😂
✨Tommy, Chris Brown is Toxic…American Rappers drug celebrities & set up sexual encounters with women or men and blackmail them…so they can later call it rape or a gay encounter…You are a good Christian man that the devil loves to destroy…don’t be baited & lured away from your wife & child
Let’s be honest, it wasn’t fair from the start, like tommy does this professionally and ksi does music.😂😂😂
Tommy clearly won. KSI fought well. Tommy is a serious professional boxer.
#childreninneed children in need is really helpful like everyone one is believe in your self  and don’t let your self down don’t believe in anything what over people say but stay strong and positive. No one is different believe in your self💜❤️💙  (Copy paste it post it everywhere for people to know how amazing they are)
Jj won
Logan paul  responded Tommy is a great youtuber me true
Hi you're the best
I’m a big supporter of you and KSI, so I was never going to be satisfied with the outcome of this fight. But I did want you to win.  I hate to say it though, but that was an incredibly disappointing performance. Awkward style or not, you had every tool to squash him. The Jake win got into your head because there was really no game plan against KSI. This was too razor thin, and it really could’ve gone either way. You just barely got by. KSI should be humble in defeat, but you should admit this was embarrassing.   End of the day though, this fight may have been shit to watch, but I’m still a fan. You’ll for sure do way better the next fight against whoever, and I’m excited to see it.  3 weeks too late to comment, I know, Congrats regardless Tommy Fury 🙌🏽
well done tommy u deserve that win so proud of u as your biggest fan
Tommy Fury lately been one of my personal fav boxers, taking a ton from watching his style of boxing and enjoy watching you bro!
Bounce bounce bounce jab then overhand silly 🤦
I thought it was a close fight but after watching it back and judging it I had you winning every round and the second was a draw. Ksi threw no punches
Bro like he’s straight up jamming into fury
I don’t know why people keep talking about the clinches clinches don’t lose points they can clinch if they want and ksi won this and ksi deserved to Atleast get the draw I scored it round 1 10-9 ksi round 2 10-8 ksi round 3 10-9 Tommy fury round 4 10-9 Tommy fury round 5 9-9 round 6 depending on how you scored it it’s either a ksi draw or win theirs no possible outcome where Tommy fury won this
Tommy is the best
I've noticed something with both this fight and Tyson's fight with Ngannou. Although both Tommy and Tyson were technically landing more shots throughout the fight and anyone who is attentive enough would realise that, everyone seemed to think that KSI and Ngannou were robbed because they may have looked more aggressive and thrown bigger shots. Not how you win a boxing match. Fair play to both the Fury brothers the best in the business currently, God bless
Tommy is a more skilled fighter. KSI has a lot gas in his tank. If he becomes more skilled he would be a interesting fighter.anyways Fury won the fight
Love too watch you fight Tom 10:14
Ksi is nothing all he does is plat FIFA games and  me and my bestie are such such BIG fAns of the Fury family and we are big fans of tommy
So we’re hitting back of the head punches every clinch? Ok 🤡
Why did Ksi want to do six not eight he’s scared of u Tommy😂
Tommy deserved that win🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm disappointed you didn't knock him out, but as far as boxing goes, there was only 1 man in the ring. Best of luck for the future for you and your family.
Ksi was robbed  haha robbed of his dignity  haha fury family always for the win
https://youtube.com/shorts/hMCpmOxxQXU?si=1oEYeLkY1YNZxnjE
The only way ksi could hit Tommy was by clinching then swinging with his open hand. Clinch to stop Tommy from doing anything poor strategy
Thanks Tommy!
Pls pls pls get Shane as ur partner for this channel...his content is elite
Well done on the win Tommy ❤
Tommy is the best. It's clear as day that he is the real champion.
Literally the entire internet thinks your a load of horse shit. How many hits to the back of KSI’s head were there, a lot. Yes there was a lot of clinching from KSI but he still won and you paid them to make sure you won. Or you simply won because your brother is The Gypsy King. And to anybody who comes to the comments of this comment to prove me wrong, try me ass holes. You don’t like him because he’s good, you like him because is brother is the Gypsy King.
The only thing that makes ksi big is his forehead
Ksi kept on clinching toomy won
Whos tommys next oppent if tommy has fought that far as to who he wants next
Ksi is a hugger not a fighter
Lommy Lury
Ksi is such a sore loser😂😂 if they gift him this appeal I’ll kill myself, I can’t bear to see all the ksi fanboys bragging
When I first watched the fight I thought it was a draw, rewatching it again I can see ksi definitely won round 2, idk why 2 judges gave round 2 to Tommy fury.
Horrible fight imagine getting paid to hug each other I'd want my money back that should go down in history 4 the worst fight in history 💯💩
Wasnt KSI's night, but that being said. I really do believe that if he takes the lessons he needs to learn from this, he COULD 100% beat tommy. Unfortunatly ya lost brother but not because you arent skilled and or you were robbed. You froze up after the mid 3rd round. KSI can box man, he ain't there yet but he ABSOLUTELY HAS the ability to become a really good boxer. IF he keeps refining this craft
Well done tomy fury you are good example for young man out there 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
I do not understand in any possible way how anyone can try and claim that Tommy Fury won this fight, It was at best a draw.KSI got robbed.
KSI's contribution to this fight.. hop hop hop (big right) (clinch)  hop hop hop hop (big right)(clinch) hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop (big right)(clinch) hop hop (big right)(clinch) (repeat for 6 rounds)
R1 - KSI 10-9 R2 - KSI 10-8 R3 - Fury 10-9 R4 - Fury 10-9 R5 - Fury 10-9 R6 - Fury 10-9  When the fight finished being that close I thought it would have went to KSI but credit to the judges for getting it right. Fury by 1 point.
all hail Tommy furry 😁
Ksi is a joke no boxing skill what so ever I would even fight him for a pay day well done tommy boy
ksi tries to hit from distance with a mile sprint misses 100% of time cause there is a real boxer front him. and clings next cause there is no option then trading blows and thats something he not there for. punches to his back head he deserved. really no boxer at all. is youtube money still not enough for him? tbh i think tommy got maybe paid to go easy on him. i see some weird movement. you even see ksi sometimes just loook away hiding from the hit but then tommy stops like it was a fake punch. im happy tommy not gonna go in these yt boxers no more. nice actor u became tho. hope it did pay wel atleast.
Why was ksi doing star jumps and not keeping his hands up that’s why Tommy won the fight❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is a message to all those that  paid to watch this comedy show..  If you leave a comment saying i did I will be able to help you .  Please Don't stay in hiding
The amount of tommy hitting ksi in the back of the forehead of ksi is wild   I thought dora was blind  but Ref is utra pro max blind
If I had a dollar for how many times I saw them hug!
What fans Tommy? 😂 just because people know your name because of your half brother, it does not mean they’re your fans my guy
Wow KSI suck by clinging on tommy lol
KSI isn’t supposed to win all he doing is jumping clinching and he didn’t keep his hands up. Tommy fury definitely won fair and square
Hay Tommy whats it like getting hugged 76 times  in a boxing match 13 hugs per round ksi could make hugging hes profession
brother, the fact that you published a thankyou to your fans, which I am not by the way ... tells a lot about you. You are your best and god bless you for that
Ksi more like scardy 🐈
tommy was doing the same shit fight both fighters were crap ksi new style is crap but still say tommy was more composed
Literally tallied up the amount of times they both initiated a clinch from round 1-5 since I couldn't find the full round 6 online, and it was a 6 clinch difference. KSI had initiated 22 times and Tommy initiated a clinch 16 times, Tommy being the one tangling KSI is arms up the most. Maybe if I saw round 6 the gap might have increased but I doubt it be a massive difference. People also don't get that KSI is fighting style requires him to stay on the ropes so his reasoning for clinching is valid since he wouldn't be able to circle out to his left or right constantly or AT ALL whereas Tommy could have easily done so but instead chose not too step back or circle.  My point is they both clinched  but one had a reason too while the other had multiple times where he didn't have too(Tommy). In other words they clinched hella times, because I didn't include the amount of times they both initiated a clinch or where they both HAD to clinch.
You lost that fight bro
This is a said day for boxing if this is what the sport has turned into. Arguing about who won but how could either have have pride in a fight  like this.
Embarrassing fight for ksi, boring fighter. Jake's fight was alot more entertaining
When you want people to think you're a boxer so bad, but just spam the one-two-hug for the whole bout 😴😴
Youtuber vs "Professional Boxer" and the Pro STILL didn't ko him. Pathetic. You might as well be a youtuber yourself
People don't realize KSI baited fury into grabbing ksi'§ left arm... He was underneath... Fury grabs his arm naturally because ksi got inside position... That negates fury'§ power right. Boxing is chess.. it's not KSI fault fury fell for it. Watch the ref the whole fight. Tommy had a shit load more talking to'§... KSI traded a lot of right bodies for fury's left bodies in the clinches. Tommy turned it on later and I think he won the "more damage given" but KSI won some rounds with his strategy... Caps off for ksi winning strats with a fury🤝🤝
I think the referee should have won it as compensation for having to watch it. Awful.
Ksi wants to cuddle not fight
Tommy won all day long
This is not boxing
You lost boy
my fuckin boy took it home good shit G
Easy money!
Omg this is awful to watch I thought it was a boxing match not a dance and hug contest 😅
Tommy Fury doesn’t deserve this win. His performance was pathetic. Should’ve automatically been handed the loss after punching KSI in the back of the head over and over and over. KSI fought fair and square and deserved the win more than Tommy Fury. Fury is a dirty Boxer and Cheater. Period, Nuff said.
I’ve watched many boxing matches over the past 3 decades and after watching this match I have to admit, KSI’s way of ‘boxing’ is the most weirdest I have ever seen.  Not only that people wanted KSI, as well as KSI to win.  The only thing KSI would win is being a bad dancer award.
Go fight real fighters now… always talking about how these influencers are garbage etc. well you barely beat them and your scared of real fighters… Go fight Riley you bum
Ppl say ksi got robbed dont know shit about boxing
KSi beat you and the fact he went 6 rounds with a pro boxer clearly you ain’t that good 😂😂😂
Damn ksi really look like the predator from the movie predator vs aliens
KSI style is like a bird with no feathers trying to take-off lmao
Embarrassinggggg
Big up Tommy, this success couldn't happen to a better guy , humbled two youtube boxers  , we thank you for that 😂
That fight was absolute trash, and KSI should have won, but i'm more disappointed in Tommy, dude has an abnormal reach about 7 inches of wingspan longer then his height, the average man has a wingspan that's 2 to 3 inches longer then his height, it's disappointing, because even with such genetics, he somehow manage to not take advantage of it, most of their fights where just hugs, with such advantage in arms length he should have been untouchable, but this happened: Round 1:🫂 Round 2:🫂Round 3:🫂Round 4:🫂Round 5:🫂Round 6:🫂
Should have been an MMA or Muay Thai fight with the amount of clinching. Overall Tommy definitely had the cleaner shots.
you won. but what fans are u on about?
When u think that people actually payed to watch this shit 💩
If ksi had actually stood and tried to box, he would get knocked the fuck out
Tommy es un boxeador de verdad, tuvo que haber acabado en KO, es una vergüenza este resultado.
man ksi actually tried tho, he blocked every single one of tommy’s punches with his face
2 of the best huggers to ever step foot into the friendship ring
Bet Molly was getting jealous of KSI keep hugging Tommy😂. Point deducted for tommy for throwing puches but nothing for ksi for constantly hugging 🙄
Draw at best and after that fight  neither of these 2 should ever be allowed on ppv again. What a shit show. There was less grappling in barboza mma fight which was on that night too. 🤷🏽
Hug fest 2.0
Ksi hit Tommy on the back of his head several times but started crying everytime Tommy just touch the back of his  head 😂 worst rhem a fotballplayer
I am not sure who won huging contest my opinion draw ksi rocked him once tommy kept missing as tommy is pro fighter ksi deserves it more he just showed he is on the same level
Ksi was shit, he was always holding him , idk why Ksi thinks he won that lol , Tommy Fury alltheway professional boxer
‘Tyson doesn’t hit hard’…ahem - 31-1-0  24 KO’s? = 12 in early rounds, 8 in the mid rounds and 4 in the later rounds…the remaining every 8 other fights has knocked his opponent down minimum twice to almost 4 times. (Yes even when he drew wilder and was knocked down twice in that fight). Sorry jj I’ve loved you since a kid but you have become a fame driven egoist in the last 2 years- you are not a fighter or a rapper, simply a funny lover. You won’t be a professional fighter because you just don’t want it badly, if he did he’d be one already - the guys a serious hard worker but he knows himself it’s one or the other boxing is not a sport it’s an entire culture and something you commit with your life to be the best. KSI is not the same YouTuber from fifa videos anymore, he’s not even a side man because he’s always trying to be a main character- well guess what welcome to the real world bro, in boxing EVERYONE else also believes they are the main character! Because they worked for it, people need to stop just thinking they can put the gloves on and challenge whoever now yeah 👍these games are over stop shitting on people who come from nothing and use the ring as their way of life, there’s a reason it’s called the ring but it’s a square box- those with passion and talent natural or refined will think outside of it! These idiots just jump cause they see cheques waving around and when they get in they realise ‘oh fuck I’m trapped’. So happy he lost honestly I love him but I hope this does well to lower the ego and reality check him. Sometimes people need an L in life from somebody else so that they can get the W on themselves. Logan Paul did it, fucked up his whole career, learned from mistakes rebuilt bridges and found double the fame and success- I don’t even like Logan but at this point I’d rather him come to my wedding than KSI and that says a lot from being a sub when hesky time and rape face was a trend smh
Ksi doing jumping jacks instead of fighting 😂
Why they hug so much
nah nigga , send location
Tomy Fury needs to stop indulging these jokers now and concentrate on his career,this is a joke,ksi jumping around too much,too much hugging and lacks precision and I think wasn't there to try and beat Tommy but just take a payday and try not to get knocked out,what a joke.
Disappointing. Both were equally as guilty of clinching. Tommy's jabs lacked much power and the whole fight lacked real skill. Watching fighters down our local club where my grandson boxes is much more entertaining and they show much more skill and dedication. These two looked like it was just an act to get a pay cheque, boring and lacking in skill.
is that Boxing? or are those Influencers boxing for the first time?  srsly asking
Ksi boxing style is shit😂😂
He better have beaten that black fool!!
Pls upload and shoutout
I'm happy that Mr Fury silenced the critics, and showed the world that YouTube is YouTube and that a man like Tomy and others who give their lives to boxing cannot compete 🖕
It was definitely a draw. Neither of you guys diserved to win
It should have been draw
This was so bad from tommy an ksi😂
Meh, draw at best for you. Scoring was dodgy regardless and ksi infsct statically landed 3 times as many punches as you. But yay you beat an influencer boxer. What an hero 😂 you can’t win another pro fight unless the guy has 200 losses on his record. Call it a day lad.
Ksi whole game plan was to hug, make up complaints to get points taken from Tommy, throw wild punches hope they land, and if not survive. Wack. Jake will wreck him like Jake wrecked Nate Robinson.
This guy would be perfect in wwe
This fight was sad asf
Where the fuck did they want u to hit him when all he was doin was holdin ye when u hit him at the back off the head might of  knock some sense in to him then to realise he's not a proper boxer
Don't know why the crowd screamin when he is just swingin his arms most of them r not even hitting like a feather
So glad u did that showed him who an what a real boxer is he's just a dirty fighter thinkin he knows what he is doin but no
I do not understand in any possible way how anyone can try and claim that KSI won this fight. He literally just tried to tie Tommy up the entire time.
Ugly boxing.
Fury is a joke.
KSI talked all that shit to show up and hug this man the entire fight. he looked horrible the entire time, would have gotten floored if he ever even attempted to actually box. Embarassing really.
YouTube fights be too weak
Come on Tommy  you have to get the K.O. Next fight………
Ksi sucks doo doo
I admit KSI was clinching a lot but is no one gonna talk about Tommy constantly turning a clinch into a headlock? Like he’s clearly deliberately putting him in headlocks and I just don’t know why
KSI has a very sparkly costume for all the dancing he is doing
This guy doing jumping jacks!? Wtf
You guys put on a great fight. Congrats on the win.
Bro ksi starting to cry by getting hit behind the head ik its against the rules but he did that to tommy more and than when he does it back he started to cry like a lil baby because he knew he was losing 😂😂😂 like just walk out of the ring at this point like that guy did when he didn't want to fight and cry to yo fans😂😂😂
None of them can fight. Worst attempt of a boxing match ever!
That fight made me so nauseous...  ksi literally just hopped back and forth the whole time while occasionally throwing a long right cross followed by hugging... wtf man
Ksi knew he bit off on more than he can chew, tactic was to launch surprise attack and hug  all rounds. If he went toe to toe boxing, most likely would have got knocked out and outclassed. So the tactic was to rush in and hug, basically find a way to kill time without properly boxing. Watch his other fights, he never hugged .
KSI lost because he failed to engage in boxing. Tommy didn't have many opportunities to box, but had ring generalship so default win.
Ksi literally ran and kept switching his foot placement making any jabs he tried to land completely fall short. Hes a terrible boxer😂
The ref did his job. Protect KSI as long as possible so it looks like a competitive match. Anyone says KSI won is either on some good stuff or just stupid.
You are dead bro
The person who has punched every one of his opponents in the back of the head, cried when he got hit in the back of the head 😂 crazy how he gets the red on his side when it happens to him 👀
Jeez… KSI is not a good boxer AT ALL. Bro, keep your hands up and stop flapping them at your waist.
Mate not being funny you’ve technically lost cos youve kept hitting on JJ back of his head and you’ve should’ve been disqualified also you’ve think you won when judge wrote by mistake so technically you lost the fight, only reason you won because your brother Tyson fury 🥴🤣
All this “training with the best of the best” and KSI bounces up and down, flapping his wings like a penguin. First round in and neither of them look very good at all but at least Tommy has the movements of a boxer.
Tommy said the ksi goes full round with him it's and lost then he celebrated like he won the heavy weigh title he fought two YouTuber and showed what level his at because ksi the only way he was going to win was by ko he wasn't going to shock the world with his boxing skill and Jake his boxing skill were OK but they were both shit Tommy showed what level he was at go fight slim or logan Paul because you will not even touch a British title
People saying ksi hugging they were both doing it Tommy was doing the same vs jake ksi was only was to win was by a ko he wasn't go to turn canelo the ko didn't happen and he fought like that but Tommy his meant to be the pro and that what he showed no matter what in front of you his the pro and that was he showed
Good job Tommy. Showing these youtube wannabe pro boxers that theres levels to boxing
Ksi looks so ridiculous bouncing like that. What style would you even call that 😂😂 and so many people were saying tommy kept hitting him in the back of the head, but don’t care to notice Ksi turning his head in the clinch.
Ayo listen to 202 to 205 listen to the kid
Ksi go back to your wee videos stop trying to buy your way into things b..€h
If KSI spent more time fight instead of dancing and hugging.... probably could have won.... but i dout it
Never took a boxing lesson in my life and I’m still sure I’d defeat either of these contestants.
Well done mate, even after their dirty tactics you stood your ground, KSI did everthing to avoid fighting you because he knew he would get out boxed, you deserve it.
Great work Tommy - by far technically the best boxer.
KSI was out of reach for the 3 minutes I watched this was shockingly bad as far as fighting never mind boxing
KSI won most clinch exchanges. Tommy wasnt landing much clean punches, KSI should've won this man
He just needs to work on not smothering his work half a step back and straight shots with a uppercut would have knocked down ksi but he needs to cut down the lightheavyweight if hes serious about boxing theirs too many killers at cruiserweight such a nice lad tommy is tho wish him all the best in the future
Ksi just ran away most of the fight. Fury was the only one trying to fight.
Not a fan of you but good fight👍
U lost mush
The fact that Tommy is Tyson's brother is embarrassing
Ksi put on the greatest hug war of the year ❤️
both of them where just going for RAW power no giving yr oppenet time to think but since both of them where doing it its hard for only one of them to dominate that mactch
forced a decision against a 30 year old fifa player mate nice one
L fight
I see ksi is using hug style
Ksi is officially the worst fighter what a joke that little man
They tryna cuddle or something that had to be the most boring fight I've ever seen
Ksi = imma throw a punch than clinch him every time
Why is ksi hugging him ever opportunity. Should be called gay-si
I watched a couple minutes of it and could not watch anymore are they supposed to be fighting or something?
yall gotta stop fucking riding tommy
ksi really doesn't deserve to win, he always does the same thing, we'll say they're in need of cuddles, not even worthy of fighting against fury
Ksi sore lose and play actor.  He didn't come to fight he came a fanny around.
Hope Tommy's done with this now, cross over/influencer boxing has it's place but we've got to see him in pro fights, you could see his quality in this. As he said, he may not ever be Tyson but he has his own potential to realise. Back to competing now lad
KSI just kept hugging Tommy. I’m starting to wonder…. 😂
So KSI basically does cardio and bounces around followed by a clinch.
KSI worries about his stupid ass hair too much. 😂
All I see is KSI grabbing holding onto Tommy for dear life which made it an ugly fight. KSI clearly too scared of getting knocked out by Tommy. Must be so frustrating fighting someone who just wants to hold and hold and not let go and appalling that the referee let it carry on like that. Tommy had no choice but to just fight him on the inside as ref wasn't breaking them up. A point should have been deducted. I’m glad the judges scored it correctly in the end. KSI is delusional for thinking he wont that fight for doing nothing but clinch.
Ksi grabbing non stop while dipping his head down wards of course ur gonna get hit in the back of the head when you do that shit. Ksi I give a 4 out of 10
Not much of a boxing match up when there's only one boxer trying to box with a jackass who's deluded and thinks he's a boxer,tommy would be better of not lowering himself to this level of nonsense
KSI should give free hugs in the street not in the ring. The most boring fight I have ever seen
The fact KSI was crying over punches to the back of his head was WILD , we all know that’s a forehead hit 😂
Bro got away with a rob💀 how much did you pay the judges?
These npcs in the comments bro💀 Ksi got ROBBED!
Ksi looks stupid in there
Ksi is so lonely he only wanted to fight Tommy for some hugs😂
All ksi does is slip and go in for a clinch.  Lmao and he thinks he won 😂
https://youtube.com/shorts/cUQYICPquXo?feature=shared
https://youtube.com/shorts/cUQYICPquXo?feature=shared
i agree with ksi being not there to box and more like trying to wrestle !1 ksi is crap and id box him and im 47 and I KNOW id beat him even though my career was done at 20 yrs old because of 1 punch landed me 4years sentence when i was 16 and couldnt claw it all back so this youtube boxing should be stopped unless it proper crossovers both ways including boxers to get into the cage and fight mma stars the way they fight all the time as all seems one sided to be honest but tommy i reckon needs to learn from his mistakes and after a good few hard bouts with proper boxers i think will shape him into a great fighter! i rate tommy more than the bullcrap and liar of tyson fury whos dodging usyk !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! usyks got my vote and im full on english
YOU LOST, HOW U EVER GONNA BE A WORLD CHAMPION WHEN U GO TO DECISON WITH YOUTUBERS LMAOOO
Fair play Tommy, I get it the pressure is a lot. But genuine advise here, get your coach Alex back who you had for the Jake fight, you looked a lot more technical and polished in the Jake fight. You will benefit with a proper coach
KSI got rigged
KSI threw a punch to the back of Tommy’s head then cried when Tommy did it 2 seconds later, absolute 🤡
Tommy, I really like you as a person, I respect your morals and values and your work ethic, but your boxing is just not on the level.  KSI was a bit of a mess on his feet, but he landed more punches.
Ksi aint no boxer….. he was boring to watch
You are a bum 😂😂. Fight a real fighter 💪. You barely won against a guy who was hugging and doing jumping jacks 😂
you lost
ksi was scared to fight 😅
JJ honestly as a fan of you wtf is this. You only ever lunge and do a 1-2 left first and then a right hand. It’s jarring to watch. All ksi fans like me need to stop being biased, Tommy looked bad partly because he couldn’t do anything because JJ would just clinch every time
I want to see Tommy vs that referee.
Ksi fought like mitch green😂😂😂
Why did it seem like they were speaking to each other when they kept hugging
Holy fucking clinching. Punch clinch punch clinch punch clinch punch clinch. Ref took 3-5 business days to break it up.
LMFAOO KSI THOUGHT HE WON...... YEAAAAAAAAA THE LIE DETECTOR DETERMINED THAT WAS A LIE !!!
Tommy was clinching to ya blind
Same strategy as Jake Paul his first few fights
KSI WAS ROBBED AND YOU KNOW IT. YOUR DAD AND BROTHER WERE SECONDS AWAY FRIM DISOENING YOU UNGIL YOU WERE SAVED MY A BUNCH OF BIAS REFS
Who let's anyone in a professional ring who can't keep their hands up.  Pro boxing is in trouble.  Clearly
As a JJ fan, props to you mate!
Nice Tommy ! 🧡🖤
is this what they want people to ppw for? 18 minutes of hugging? tommy you're doing well under these circumstances but jeeeeesus.. i'd rather pay ppw for a -10 fights amateur fight :)
In it
Ksi actually did alot more than people know here. He put okna hell of a show and controlled the crowd. I reckon he watched alot of Pirnce Nazeem footage before hand
to the ksi fanboys who have obviously never watched a real boxing match. pls just watch one boxing match that doesnt involve youtubers then come back to this fight and remake ur opinion
i thought ksi won but it is true that tommy the one always chasing ksi around and dominant the gamse

Ref on ksi side smacking tommy 9:29
KsI moves about like third fighter in victory boxing career mode
Just watched a few minutes and now I know why I'd never pay to watch rubbish like this .....
A lot of hugging & donkey punching 😂
KSI a closet pervert with a fetish for hugging
I will say if Tommy threw more uppercuts in the pocket, he may have gotten a knockdown/knockout. After Tommy threw a jab, ksi would duck down all fight. So again if he threw more uppercuts. It probably would’ve be a different outcome
What are your tactics tonight KSI??? Klinching Says I
keep on improving Tommy, you earned a new fan 👍
Both u guys were rubbish. But ksi just could not stop hugging tommy must be love
Ksi ia black that's already a loss
Its draw comparing both side of videos....56.57
Dirt cheat
Was it a hugging match for KSI and boxing match for Tommy? Lmao KSI don’t ever ever box again your an embarrassment. Keep doing your star jumps and hugging your pillow instead of men
Everybody in the comments here are all dog water, Ksi won the fight and it was corrected because of mad maths by the judge's
Ksi strategy: jumping jacks, 2-3 jabs, hug, repeat
Tommy if you are a real boxer, stop doing this YT boxing, you said you wanted no part of it when you fought jake but you are back in there fighting a child like adult and for money only. go do some pro boxing you are better than this!!!
KSI at the end said that Tommy kept grabbing him, that is not what i see, a lot of people that came to see a fight got really ripped off!!! every fight in this event was crap fight. misfits is embarrassing this sport. Then you got KSI pulling a temper tantrum at the end!!! GIVE EVERYONE THERE MONEY BACK!!!!!
So rigged Tommy some pro boxer, training since you where 6 years old and went the distance with someone training 5 years and also dose YouTube music and runs other businesses trash
Tommy please don’t compare u to your brother it’s not fare to u. Your brother is 6’9” for crumb sakes and has 150 lbs on u. You r your own fighter and man and I have so much respect for Tommy not because he’s a Fury but for your boxing and the man that u r. U Tommy Fury is a great man on his own don’t fall into that trap. Each child in a family has thier own fantastic traits. Would u want one of your children to compare themselves to the other sibling? No never so don’t do it to yourself. I’m so proud of the Man U r. Sorry for babbling.
HOW DID KSI NOT WIN KSI WAY MORE HITS ON HIM  I WANNA SEE A REMATCH
Tommy couldve done more damage… that was… bland
An aspiring world champion going life and death with YouTubers is just embarrassing
O my God ksi is more awful than I expected. Bouncing around like that flapping his arms like a bird. Every time they got close enough to punch he grabbed Tommy tight. Tommy was terrible also but ksi was god awful
Not quite convincing enough for me Tommy, would you be willing to do it again for the fans and put this guy to bed for good?
Rare K for ksi , icl tommy cooked even though i was supporting KSI congrats on the win tommy
KSI crouching in pain from that Back of the head shot was such bullshit 😂😂 that was a little tap ffs, barely any power at all, I've been hit like that at the back of my head and nothing happened.
Ksi is a punk and what a piece of crap that ref was. If your going to look the other way when ksi was holding 3/4 of the fight and not say anything but when Tommy holds u penalize him u need to get a new job ref Also when the ref walks Tommy to the corner and goes away without saying a word all of a sudden cry baby ksi holds the back of his head and the ref decides to punish Tommy. If it happened and the ref didn’t c it he can’t just punish Tommy because the other fighter puts his hand to the back of his head. How about looking at replay but to punish him after the fact when u didn’t c it and neither did we. Alls fair in love and war but don’t cheat. If it’s good for one it’s good for the other. I really didn’t care who won this fight but I want to c two mean fighting not one crying all the time. The ref needs to look at the fight and c where he can change for the better. Bad look!
you know you didn't deserve that win😂😂
*Cool stuff*
Ksi robbed
Grabs tommys back the whole time and then  fires up lol thats not boxing
The ref _LITERALLY_ had to smack you and pull you to the side for a word 🥴💀 and you think you won!?
The way you flinch while he dances around you speaks volumes. You lost and you know it 🫵 stop hitting the back of the head if you’re such a ‘pro’.
ksi should for won the fight he got robbed
Full speed through this just is depressing
This guy Tommy got selective hearing when it comes to comments or somethin? 😂 man has convinced himself that he’s the true victor 👏🙈
Well done tommy good fight 👌🏾
Thats not even boxing. Good job Tommy, but im not gonna congratulate you. Frankly it would be an insult. Like cheering someone for breathing.  Never had any doubt about the outcome. Hoped KSI would have more to show by now though.
Ksi is not a boxer in fact he makes boxing look bad if he wants to clinch all the time tell him to go grapple
You all looked like Village idi0ts 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Congratulations for the win
you punched him in  the back of the head multiple times dude, thats not even boxing at that point that can be fatal blows and very illegal in and out of boxing. you might have won the match but you def lost. and everyone knows it besides all your yesmen in the comments.  thats a fact.
I apologize if you paid money you worked for to see this grappling match😂
Ksi game plan was I’ll do star jumps and hope it distracts him enough to land a punch then lunge and if I miss my punch I’ll just hug him till it’s safe to try the same again.. and that’s basically the whole fight
I feel sorry for those that believe tommy fury would ever knock ksi...its not that ksi is a good boxer...he's not but tommy is not the  "pro boxer" he thinks he is. This fight was ridiculous. They both have robbed whoever paid for this. We need to bring respect back to the sport of boxing. I guess somehow they are gonna hype a fight between logan and tommy next...we are gonna hear how they both are gonna destroy the other and how its gonna be a all out war...but then it never happens because these dudes are not real boxers. Top class boxers put bodies away...these influencers are all pals in real life making millions in prize money and by betting on the side. Wake up kids
What a sh*t hugging match 😂😂😂😂
Ksi got recked and the whole UK should be ashamed
How the fuck ksi thought he won that is beyond me. The boy is deluded. Did absolutely nothing to win
ksi is a joke. I bet he tells people he's a boxer
Ksi is a dirty fighter the hugs he planned so he know if he played  fair people will c his nt gd he also hits tommy on his head and doing wild ass hits thats not  boxing jumping up and down like a kangaroo hugs just hitting on side of rib no body shots i was surprised he didnt use elbow he choose 6 rounds he planned it to go his way now tommy reputation ruined fighting person like him cause all blind ones including his frnds say tommy lose or he pay them to say it f him ksi
Tommy’s corner must be giving him nothing, the left rip to the liver open asf the whole time with ksi’s retarded ass stance or slip n right uppercut to the only punch his threw the whole fight
Dunno why tommy cant out class and knock out a YouTuber, he's been training all his life
Let's be honest, you didn't win. The fact that it was even remotely close says a lot. Stick to YouTube boxing or continue to box 0/100 "pro boxers".   You are probably 20+ heavier than KSI and you couldn't/didn't capitalize that. You have been boxing since you were a kid and you're still fighting like an amateur. You are part of the Fury family so we all expected better.  You're not championship material sorry.
YOU LOST BROTHER HAHA
What are KSI doing 😂 jumping around and swing the hands? What a ngoofy
K.s.i.show boating..he won't win doing that..he's not a good enough fighter.
K.s.i.hes scared...and you can't show boat and win a fight..he's been watching Jake paul to much..
Ksi should of won he got robbed
So was that ksis grand plan? To just do jumping jacks the entire fight?
Ban hugging from boxing. Waste of everyone’s time.
Ksi was scared
KSI the dream dancer
real shame a "pro boxer" is struggling with a youtuber even though tommys been training since around age 9, ksi threw way more punches still think someone messed with the card your illegal head basher
Thanks for showing this moron KSI his place bro
I love you Tommy ❤❤❤
Bro what in the fuck is ksi’s stance and form 😂  He needs to have his guard up. I’m 16 and got way better boxing form than both of these guys 😂
Tommy wanted to give ksi a boxing lesson ksi wanted to give tommy a bachata lesson😂
Robbery
Draw
KSI over extends his punches leaving his hand out and dropping them honestly kind of a joke
Funny how at 1:45 you can see ksi lamp tommy with an illegal blow to the back of the head, and tommy sorta pauses for a second and goes fuck it ill give him a two back
Also, I can see why the judge didn’t take a point because that was literally a love tap on the back of the head saying get busy man dude fell to the ground like he just got hit in the back of the head with a sledgehammer talk about overacting
KSI never won. It’s a draw at best for him… HOWEVER… for someone who’s been boxing there whole life….. KSI deffo takes the moral victory cause Tommy….. you aren’t very good bro! This is your level
Tommy pushed the pace the whole entire fight constantly moving forward that’s what one the decision ksI  was too busy running away and  wrapping up every chance he got trying to use the old chicken hand technique that Roy Jones one did the entire fight instead of getting in a proper boxing stance
U lost mate look at the new overturned results
Wtf is a ksi y yall puttin clowns inda ring waste of time
Nah cause who ever thinks fury won is dumb asf & whoever thinks ksi one is even dummer
They just collide over and over. Biggest sign of amateur skill level
Not a fan of yoiu, but you sure can fight, for that you have my respect.
They gave the whole match to tommy just because of his last name they couldn’t bear the fact that a YouTuber could beat a professional boxer especially from the fury family the ref actually crossed out a 7 and wrote an 8 just so tommy could win
Ksi kept bouncing back and fourth only to hug Tommy. He should just try ifc with that stance and mindset
Why KSI is so jumpy? 😂😂😂 joke, sorry 😞
How can you say ksi one when he clearly didn't
Well done Tommy! Easy win
lil bro u didnt win
If you think ksi won your delusional its obviois to see who is over powering who
Kai can’t really box or keep his guard up idk why people rate him up so much 🤦🏽‍♂️ looks like he can’t really fight in general his style of fighting but oh well
You didn't win. Neither did he. It was a draw at best.  I'd expected better from you than to land cheap shots and hit him at the back of the head.  Y'all need a rematch where we actually see you two box. And you should give him credit. He hit you quite a few times. Still, very sloppy fight (your dad's words)
When Jake lost at least he took it on the chin KSI is  an embarrassment kicking a wall like a 5yo Throwing a tantrum in a supermarket 🤡🤡🤡
The biggest losers are the fools that paid to watch this shower.
We all got scammed hard
KSI made this a boring fight. He didn't lie when he said he's not going to box. But certainly didn't come to fight. Sore loser. But all these influencers claim it was a robbery. KSI was fighting on his own promotion. It's insane! 😂
Swear I can hear molly mae in the back ground "cmon tommy" lol bless her
Idk what ksi was doing swinging his arms with little to no defense by it was certainly not boxing. This guy didn’t win shit
Worst fight I have ever seen
Ksi did the xenomorph style run and grab
There was no winner. After seeing that, KSI would definitely lose to Jake Paul. KSI showed me he is not a boxer. Nowhere close.
Missed the bit were he rocked you
KSI will go down as the greatest boxer in history. Would of even beaten David Haye in his prime 😂.
https://youtube.com/shorts/09Gvqw36EEc?si=NX8PBGkUkDBVr2cd
Ok I know ksi would have won or minimum draw. But what you don't see is the amount of times tommy hit Ksi In the back of his head, everyone says ksi lost by a point right? Tommy got deducted for hitting back of Ksi's head YET HE KEPT DOING IT! NO MORE POINTS WERE TAKEN OFF? HELLOOOO
9.34 mins into video referee punches Tommy in the bicep instead of proper slipt overs fighters
9.32 mins into this video,is the slap to Tommy fury ,by the referee is assault 😮
Anyone who bought the fight needs their head testing! A no mark boxer who earns his living off his relatives name, fighting with you tubers who are mma fighters… and still he can’t knock either of them out….. it’s unbelievable….. making a mockery of the sport, and making fools of all the people that bought into the hype and bought the fight.
This must have sucked for tommy man you can see him put his hand up evrytime kise grabbed im. Ksi just proved that he isnt a boxer.
Wish you and your family well Tommy, but we all know there’s no way in hell you won that fight. Anybody who believes that is lying to themselves.  Not John, Tyson, or Tommy looked confident during that scorecard 😂
KSI? Who’s that?  My man was jumping like a monkey thru out the fight!!!! Bravo Tommy Fury
this was a disgrace of  match  ,i would of said that tommy fury is cherry picker but in actuality he a full on tomato can ! he displayed 0 boxing IQ and turned this from a boxing match to hugging competition .... is so hard to belive that any of them are boxing in this match , Tommy Fury looks like he learn how to box yesterday and he dares to say that he is a professional ,  he looks like a joke due to fact that he always states that he is been boxing for a lifetime , he had a Youtuber in front of him that started boxing 4-5 years ago and he is fighting with so much caution like he has Benavidez in front of him ,   and one more thing he has 0 skill from fighting on the inside he never thrown a single punch body while in clinch his only intention was to grab his arms he dose`nt even now how to establish  range distant by pressuring with jabs , he thrown 12 jabs in 6 rounds :))  , what fking joke of a match ! you are making boxing look stupid bro !
This KSI guy should not be allowed to box professional boxers, he is clearly not there for a boxing match.
KSI is bare gay all he’s done is bare hugging tf was it a hugging match or boxing match 😂 Tommy brought all the action in this fight
So did KSIs training consist of hugging his trainers? That’s all that he did
This is what happens when you think you’re BAD just cause you’re big then someone who’s actually bad and big matches your energy with ACTUAL technique. Don’t ever think you can’t lose, that’s how you’ll end up losing! It’s the beauty in staying humble, it pays off.
I don’t know anything about judging boxing or anything but damn tommy loves the back of the head especially at the end when he throws 2 punches to the back of the head such a let down tbh
I wouldn't watch this if I was locked up for life with this being the only option. Both these guys are clowns, and anyone calling this boxing is also a clown. Not a single straight punch from either man, no jabs, no hooks, no cocked hands! Every time they tried to connect, they clinched, it was hugging not boxing, extremely disgusting.
Ksi won he was robbed
Why they're clinching that much ?
Congratulations. My support, Jesus loves you
Ksi is trying to crossover to mma😂😅
wtf is ksi doing tho
Is Ksi performing African dance?
B4 I thought it should’ve been a draw but now after rewatching the fight I now think that Tommy deserves the win. The reason for this is bc KSI clearly was the one who kept initiating the clinches and he did that just to get thru the fight bc he was exhausted and trying to survive, like he wasn’t trying to have a fight, like Tommy was. The cliches were just a chance for KSI to throw shots. The fact that Tommy managed to do something with someone that awkward shows a lot and the fact that he was trying harder to have a proper boxing fight means that he should win the fight. Also the back of the head shots was due to KSI moving his head purposely so that Tommy would hit it, so I don’t think he should’ve got a point deduction.
Imagine if ksi didn’t meet Michael venom page
Looks at least 2 weight clases different
The reason why Tommy kept hitting him on the back of the head is bc JJ kept moving into him and clinching
Why did you guys keep on hugging
why Tommy hitting ksi in the back of the head... that's dirty
watching live i coudnt rly tell who was the one hugging but watching this its clear as day ksi was hugging everytime tommy threw a punch. so glad ksi lost
Good thing I didn’t pay for this there’s no doubt Tommy won he’s a real boxer ksi made it boring with allat clinching 🤣would’ve got slumped if he didn’t that’s why he kept doin it
Definitely see ksi is the one doing all the cuddling lol
you gotta be the best at hitting the back of someones head
tommy really uploaded the whole fight ty
Disgusting to see Ksi get robbed no way Tommy won that 3 rounds each and Tommy got point off jj won that
He said he beat ksi and jake and he did it in less than a year
Ksi the best...♥️♥️♥️
The longer I watch, the more this begins to look like a Charlie Chaplin movie
you did great! keep your chin up. I'm sure your family and nation is very proud of you brother
Did anybody else see KSI hit himself by 4:23 seconds 😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️🤣
Bro please train more intensively and work of your skill. Make tyson punch you more. Also don't get inder pressure when the big night comes. Stick to the game plan and trust your skills. You have so much to improve on. You're not even an average boxer at the moment but I believe you will improve. I'm rooting for your future fights
The amazing dancing chocolate lightbulb.
https://youtu.be/uF66jGNGk94?si=QymNXns9PiCVXtpo
Anyone have a count on how many times they where separated…?
Ksi strategy was to do as many jumping jacks as possible in his green skirt 😂
You still a b**** Tommy. Gotta elevate your company
Mike Tyson in his days would have bitten both ears off KSI clinching that much where is the fighting man???
I thought tommy was supposed to be a professional
Jumping jack, jumping jack, right over hand, does ksi know how to do anything else?
Ksi is a joke he didn't win shit. Y'all are dumb he clinch him everytime... He was afraid and knew he was gonna get a ass whooping so he went right in to clinching
well done tommy!
Clinch fest
Slop fest. Wasn't Furys fault. KsI fights like a sporadic 5 year old. Fury won get over it.
Good job.
Jake and fury is more entertaining than this KSI hug monster
man dose ksi not know how to throw a punch without hugging
Ksi had a less than amateur approach and he’s mad he’s lost😂I’ma grab you every time we do anything and somehow I’ma win he shoulda fought him mma definitely woulda sniffed his jock strap all the way too a 10 8 unanimous.
JJ has the worst style ever. Zero guard or blocking whatsoever so he just goes for clinch whenever Tommy lands. Incredibly annoying to watch
KSI came to do jumping jacks and clench. Then came out to say Tommy didn't land a single punch, smh. KSI was a joke, it's too bad he didn't come to actually fight, and instead of taking it like a man he cried about it, do better sir. Great job Tommy and the Fury's 👏🏽
Im a ksi fan,and a boxing fan,after that ,im disgusted, tf was that,never thought  a man would train to death to do jumping jacks,id give tommy the win any day
Maybe time to hang the gloves up tommy.
It was a dirty fight. Tommy was the professional and the true boxer. Ksi looked like a kangaroo 😂 and cuddling all the time. I won't be buying anything that ksi promotes. Tommy move on don't rematch he don't deserve it.
Tommy thank you for beating him. He needed it lol.
Tommy didn't make much contact
Tommy n1 let's go
Didn't desrver this win
You lost
Makes sure the edit out where KSI hurts him in the 1st
We can just rename this fight to “Hug Session”
How bout challenge the current  BBB of C  English 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Cruiserweight Champion , Vidal Riley (10-0-0  6 KO) ?
Ksi was holding onto tommy the entire fight…. Such a disappointment. Tommy wanted to fight. Ksi obviously didn’t want too.
Absolute joke😂I 😂all about the money
Ksi wasn't even fighting 😂😂  Let's go Tommy 👑💪🥊
Ksi likes to hug 🥰
Glad you won. Ksi flapped his arms and hugged you anytime he was in a bad position. Which was every 7 seconds. Disgraced the sport and robbed the paying fans.
You can see ksi's punches coming from a mile away they're so obvious
Thsis fight sucked ngl
Video doesn’t show round six and instead recycles  round one instead at the end for some reason
Shame
Just his style he shouldn’t be allowed to box. Looks ridiculous. He hugs more than all the granny’s in the uk
Ksi won.. ya'll robbed him!!!
That was shit
in conclusion Tommy Fury cant box for shit he is just another bum that likes to play Boxing.
Well done Tommy!    You made him look like an amateur,   I mean,   He is an amateur.  But he talked a big game.  I’m glad you shut him up
Ksi was about to receive a beat down and he knew that. That’s why he played defence 🤷🏼‍♂️
Good job Tommy! 🎉
ksi wanted to hug tommy not box 😂 ksi stance is wrong, threw 0 good punches & he kept wanting to smell tommy armpits or kiss his chest 😂 & some of you brainwashed slime drinking kids really think he won 😂
Deserved loss for jj
You came to box Ksi cake to cuddle
You lost simple as
Tommy fury is so bad he is a clown for boxing
You didn’t show yourself as a good boxer last night, you did shit, it should’ve been a draw, or a KSI win
Congratulations mate 🎉
We all know that ksi clinched most of the fight, and its due to his poor distance management. His karate boxing style makes him jump forward for explosive attacks, but since ksi has no idea how to manage his distance it ends up him cuddling with tommy fury. (Also another reason why he elbowed fournier, it was his poor distance management). Most of the punches Ksi landed was from those clinches, that’s why he had a higher accuracy and decent punch count. Honestly I think Ksi needs to do a complete redo of his style, it’s a good style but not for him.
This fight was mostly spent in the clinch. Imagine paying for it
The only people saying ksi won are people who dont know boxing
You will never win a fight holding on like ksi i was very disappointed
Tummy is strong sure he wins
Back in the day i thought boxing was a boring sport, but god damnn man after seeing this guy fight i really really appreciate real boxing way way much more
Ugly fight yuk tommy won
KSI  Is TRYING to copy Michael Venom Pages style but unfortunately it isn’t natural for him
All ksi did was grab and dirty boxing fury boxed
What was that insane style!? "Karate Jumping Jack to grab & hold" w/ some pretending to be hit in the back of the head...that was pretty awful but still way better than Danis lol
give you props for fighting someone who looks like they had a cockroach stuck up his ass maybe this time his ass stays on youtube.
I am a fan of sumo wrestler 😮
Wow look at Ksi bitching like Logan was during there fight 😭 everyone kno Logan should have won that last fight w ksi n now it happens to ksi himself 💀
Ksi is a professional cuddler after this showing 😂
The one thing I took from this is Tommy should either retire or make Misfits his new home. The fact he’s scraping decision wins against YouTubers is honestly embarrassing. No excuses.
0:25 that grab was a little to long the referee did a horrible job in this match a really fking horrible job LOL
Congrats Tommy🔥🔥🔥
skip to any timeframe in the video and i guarantee you’ll see them two clinching
Literally replayed Round 1 instead of Round 6 lol
KSI robbed
A minute 44 in and I'm already bored. Ksi ain't shit. Just lost all respect for his "fighting" career. He was terrified after talking all that shit acting like a clown during the faceoffs
Worst ref ever. Break em up. Dont let them hug for an hour still throwing weak punches
KSI has zero boxing skills he’s like a knockoff version of MVP without the ability he just bounces about, and throws wild rights 😂
Everytime I skipped ahead in this video, all they did was clinch. Man.
well done on your victory Tommy, but i must say, it didn't look like you were giving your 100%. Its either there was some agreement between yous for it to go the distance OR you just aren't even as good as a non sportsman non boxer  non professional. I think something a bit iffy has went on here, so hopefully it was for a good cause, like a charity of some sort.
Easy win!
THANKS FOR POSTING THE FULL FIGHT TOMMY, NOT ALL OF US CAN AFFORD PPV AND BOTTLES OF PRIME TO GO WITH IT, LOL,
As tommy fury what are you supposed to do when KSI cant box so he puts his head so far up your ass that the only way you can punch him is hitting the back of his head? Like it makes no sense. How are you gonna kiss the bloke and bury your face in his shoulder clinching every 5 seconds but get mad when he hits the back of your head?
KSI bouncing like The Mask
KSI the dancing fairy belongs on top of a Christmas tree.
Way to go Tommy
i fully thought you would win this but ngl ksi pulled off a draw idk about robbed but this shoulda been a draw
..
A few mill for your 10th fight well done definitely won. Credit ksinthe ballbag he did better than thought proper bell thou.
wtf did I just watched . why is ksi jumping like Bruce lee
ksi look 2 years old 😅😅😅 go to school now boy
you’re not a real pro boxer😂 and you you want to be world champ one day but never will
Everyone here shitting on KSI but fail to realise Tommy fury who's been boxing since 6 years old, goes the distance with two YouTubers and both fights were bad performance from a so-called Pro boxer. That's embarrassing
People talking about KSI clenching and yet Tommy was literally grabbing him the most not to mention the hits to the head, not a lot you can do to when your in a corner
Ksi's whole gameplan was ot lunge into an overextended overhand then crash through range and clinch till separation. And the defensive plan was to shell up and stand still until tommy is within clinching range then grab him 😂 oh and to bounce like a karate point fighter in between
Embarassing, u cant finish any youtuber 🎉🎉🎉
I'm surprised man, I'm a ksi fan but not as much as the other groups who keeps talking shit... Good fight man it's nice to humble a man when they think they are too powerful
Bro u almost lost against a youtuber and ur a professional boxer with the FURY name what a shame
Ksi fucking hpi
I feel sorry for anyone who paid to watch this shit.  KSI wasn't robbed . . . HE ROBBED HIS FANS 😭😭😭
I swear Ksi is the worst boxer, tf is this guy doin?
Now i can see why tommy kept fighting youtubers. Cos he will get rekt against real boxers 100%.
Tommy your not exactly elite. Where the fuck was your left jab. The only shorts you should be wearing are Calvin Klein's and wolly gloves on the cat walk.
https://youtube.com/shorts/5ZpEx1KWZJU?feature=shared
What’s all the star jumps about? Did anyone actually box in this fight? It’s clearly KSI just clinching when he gets in close.
KSI HUGS MORE THAN THE CARE BEARS 🌈
To think Tommy fury has 10 years more experience than Ksi and Tommy still thinks he won that fight 😂😂funny lad
How did fury not waste this douche....he thinks hes wonderboy or machita or something 😂 🤡😅😂😢
I will knock ksi out smh
I used to like ksi back in the day and actually rooted for him against Joe weller and Logan Paul but recently this guy has become such a fucking sore loser. Never seen someone so deeply deluded. Glad he finally got a reality check. Mighty work Tommy 💪🙌
All he did was jab-cross-hug. I had it closer yesterday but after re-watching its 5-1 with a point deduction imo.
This fight is a waste of time... Maybe if ksi have chosen a dancing career he would achieve more than boxing in it
I like ksi but tommy won with flying colors cry more glazzers lol
KSI should of fought Dillon Danis instead with all of those hugs. I can’t believe people paid money for this.
Ive seen better boxing in Fight Night videogames
All that training to look like a goofy in the ring
Connor would smoke both of them. Period.
Technique trash
Honestly, what the hell happened to the KSI that fought swarmz and Pineda? His form and boxing technique were so much better then… He just looks so sloppy and unprofessional in this fight. So disappointing as a KSI fan. Congrats on the win Tommy.
ROBED
Stance trash
He can’t box for shit
Why was KSI dancing so much 😂
Ksi goes for 1 punch and clinch everytime. Tommy tries to box and Ksi shits his pants and clinches, so annoying🤣
Yes ksi fought like ass but still he won round 1,2 and 6 and with the point deduction he should have won or atleast a draw And don’t be saying I’m a ksi fanboy when I want to see Jake knock ksi out
Lol this the arse kissing comment section I see, they both performed poorly, both should stick to the youtube boxing scene or stop, ksi was playing for hugs and Tommy was constantly trying to put ksi in a headlock   this was embarrassing for both the undercard was better than both main events
This was stupid
Performance could have been better lad, but in all fairness you beat the little youtube freak, you got nothing to prove to anyone anymore, well done son.
You guys are saying this about jj hugging and this and that but you don’t say anything when AT does it you bunch of hypocrites 😂😂 so you guys with this logic are saying kenny did win coz all AT was doing was hugging
This is not boxing
Wtf is ksi doing jumping around like that? Looks like an absolute fool. Hopefully YouTube boxing is done after this. Logan Paul show is now over and he won't ever fight someone in MMA, and he will never fight a "real" boxer the same size.
bro people saying really good fight so far around 6:40 💀
Not a boxing fan but If this is anything like other matches, then this sport is probably the worst. Just punch and hug💤
1:46 he literally hit tommy in the back of the head but no one said anything
3 minutes in to this video and this is a fucking disgrace to the sport of boxing. As somebody who has spent numerous hours studying the concept and applying it in my training camps and fights, this is just appalling. JJ has absolutely no distance control OR understanding, the dude is loading up for complete shots and stepping in at the same time tommy closes the distance as if that shot isn’t already set to be a mile past the target, this is initiating all of the clinches, JJ also has no inside game and thus relies only on these big “power” shots if you will, tommy being a more educated boxer closing the distance to prevent the only game JJ has, resulting in this mess of a contest. Secondly, no hate on Tommy but the dude isn’t that good of a boxer, or even very good at all (if you knew boxing you’d very easily see this). Which just shows how much worse JJ is in the context of ring awareness and understanding, JJ closing off his own exit strategies by fully backing up to the ropes and thinking he can slip things but not slipping the correct way or reading what shots are coming. Tommy has a terrible guard and his shot speed and power are very minimal, but the reality is all he had to do was walk forward towards JJ eliminating his only potential shot, being that “overhand-ish right cross” if you will; (I genuinely wouldn’t call it anything as it clearly hasn’t been trained properly enough to classify as a cross or an overhand) I’m assuming he has no idea what he’s actually throwing besides a “punch”. Which also puts JJ into unfavourable situations where he has to scramble to create more space to then feel comfortable at his “range” likely being what his dumb fucks for coaches have taught him. I could go so much more in depth here but this just isn’t a fun watch for me. This is genuinely a disgrace to the greats who have made this sport the amazingly in depth beauty that it is. This is fucking appalling truthfully.  JJ 1.5/10, Tommy for not capitalizing on JJs shit show of a display, 2.5/10. Both absolute shitters.  Go watch some real fighters and understand that you’re both so damn far off any level of “pro” or even “semi-pro”. This is damn amateur level boxing, it’s nearly fucking amateur sparring. And honestly I’ve seen 14 year old kids display a way more sophisticated skill set than this. I’m so thankful that I didn’t dish out $ to see this trash LOL
This guy pulled up to fight in a skirt ….not to mention that stance hes using is wack
what was this recorded on his uncle's flip phone? wtf
nibba thinks he is mike vemon page
ksi is a joke at boxing
You get a youtuber vs a real boxer that one is fair win for Tommy
Ksi won that hiw tf tommy won
you can not call this a boxing match
Is ksi doing some kind of rain dance?
Almost wished Tommy just walked him down (Mexican-boxing style) but I know that probably wouldn't have done anything. Horrible fight but not Tommy's fault. Hard to box someone who wants to hug their way through it and they happen to be the owner of the fight.
Watching this back it make sense why  ksi got the L. He only wanted to throw a punch in the clinch. Must have been frustrating to be in that fight against him.
Fury won easy man
Bro just showed us he lost
KSI clinched so much because he thought Tommy was his dad
Why’s he bouncing around like that with his hands down and lunging. Looks like an idiot that doesn’t know anything about boxing.
tommy fury won that shi, these ksi fans are delusional i swear😂
Wassup with that weird wing flapping bounce ksi keeping doing. It’s so easy to see his punches because they have to travel so far.
The YouTube boxing game is officially dead. Jake is the only hope
KSI should have thrown that elbow.
How boring can it get
Every YouTube boxing fight is 2 punches, clinch, repeat. I can’t believe anybody paid money to see this it’s an embarrassment to the sport 💀
Tommy:let’s box KSI: no let’s hug
Ksi is pathetic
JJ should of won
Ksi won that for sure
Urgh this fight was stupid. These YouTubers are really making a mockery of the sport, it’s becoming a joke now
Imagine paying for this
KSI was just doing star jumps
Tommy dominated. He deserved the win
even that I’m a fan of ksi but In round two ksi was hitting Tommy in the back of his head 5 times, also before the point was taken away from Tommy jj hit him first, Tommy was more aggressive and controlled the fight Ksi was jumping ducking and clinching that’s why he didn’t win,  and the overconfident mocking influence boxers all the time this maybe a karma and a lesson for him,, he don’t like to lose just except it in the end the whole event wasn’t worth my money best fight was slim vs papi.
ngl ksi style kinda weird I am still suprise he didnt get knocked out using it and even more suprised tommy dint knock him out this whole fight was a let down but say what props to both fighters for alist appearing in the ring
KSI needed a big long hug before the fight
They keep telling Tommy to stop hitting ksi in the back of the head but they should be telling ksi to stop shoving his forehead into tommy chest like😂😂
This game robbed KSI from a draw, both sides didn't do enough to win Tommy was more active in punched, KSI wasn't but connected 38 punches Tommy 39, KSI was 31% with accuracy and Tommy 25% accuracy   https://youtu.be/Y8XrC6cMPHo?si=qiCBAChpJnUyJTD9
I paid and watched the fight, but re-watching this you realise how shit KSI actually is. Grabbing and wanting all the hugs. You can’t box someone who won’t get off from clinging on to you. No it wasn’t tommys best, he admits that. Jake Paul and KSI need to go back to where they came from. However, Logan Paul I actually did think was pretty good. Considering the crap contestant he had. I think if Tommy and Logan Paul fought each other that would be a fight to see.
The black one's got the same shape head as Herman Munster
Tommy fury should focus on real fighters and not waste time on them wanna be youtubeing flip flops
16:13 That dirty uncalled shot though...
Holding for dear life then saying he won.....KSI you Sshitbag
Thank you Tommy 👍  humbled Jake an ksi
Ksi is fucking noob in boxing, even ma brother can beat him i think
JESUS CHRIST WINS AGAIN WHEN YOU PUT HIM FIRST  WELL DONE TOMMY ❤❤❤❤
All of the talk and flex for him to jump around hands lowered ovethrowing punches then clinching. Nice
Damn This Is More Jiu Jitsu then i do in a entire night..
LOVE ALL YOUR FIGHTS  KEEP ROCKIN THEM  JESUS'S WITH YOU BROTHER
Ksi tryed to get a sneaky disqualification at the end
Ksi isnt a good boxer
Dead fight
Bullshit,bullshit,bullshit they both won and we lost laughing all the way to the bank this was not a good match maybe Tyson Fury vs Francis Ngannou will be better keep a lookout for curmel that young man might have a very good pro career.
Ksi kept storming in for those knockout punches like an amateur.
Ksi is just holding not even throwing 😅 an he says he won. BULLSHIT I say 😂
Tommy did not fight like a pro. Ksi being a youtuber easily won. Even a tie. Ksi still showed way more heart and soul. (Watch 45-46seconds in)
Not very convincing win at all 😂
KSI deserved his losss 📉 😅😂😂😂
Jumping star jumps left jab overhand right wow is that it ksi 😂😂
KSI looks ridiculous with that flappy bird stance.
2 of the worst boxers I’ve ever seen
KSI was not a boxer. He had no idea. But at the same time, Tommy, I really have liked your rise to fame, but this wasn’t great. Watching Tim Tszyu straight after this was such a difference of a boxer vs YouTube boxing. I hope you switch to really boxing and not this hype train random throwing and clinching. But tactical, and defensive boxing.
It's funny... as soon as the ref takes a point from Tommy for a hit to the back of the head literally IMMEDIATELY right after KSI hits Tommy THREE TIMES to the back of the head in the ensuing clinch. Which btw... all KSI did was stand around doing half jumping jacks then charge in head down with an overhand and immediately grab/hug/clinch then repeat. He was a SORE LOSER but what can you expect from a KID/BABY who has nothing but yes men around him, who's spoiled, and the fights he did win were either from controversial point deductions or throwing an illegal elbow to the head that went conveniently unseen by the ref. SMH... it was sweet justice to see KSI cry like a baby and I hope the sting really burns today and forever with him lol
These boxers all suck nowadays. They should just go fight for MMA. These boxers nowadays are just fighters not boxers.
Ksi hugging and then complaining bout fighting in the clinch🤣🤣ah mans needs to retire
Ksi won with the point deduction. Round 1,2 & 6
But Tommy did do to many back head shots on ksi
It's painful to see KSI box, that weird, unorthodox star-jump bounce triggers me.   *kicks stage*  Props to Tommy for shutting this ''I'm built different'' clown up (once and for all)
I would like to pass on my sincere condolences to anyone that paid to watch the shite 🤦‍♂️
Fucking cuddle show 😂
Congrats on your victory Tommy, KSI was scared to actually box and tried to hug his way to victory good on you for giving him that L and humbling him
Tommy won this fight ksi only had the 1st and 2nd round that’s it Tommy had 3 4 5 & 6
He kept ducking his head into the clinch and was crying when he was it in the back of the head. KSI is not very good at boxing he makes fights boring unless he’s fighting a YouTuber
Fu... you ksi💥💥 , good job tommy🥊🥊🥊🥊
Ksi had no skil at all he just has the same combo trying to land every set 😂😂 stupid boy
He just kept clinching and clinching and clinching and doing star jumps and clinching and star jumping he’s such a boring awkward ass fighter omfg what was Tommy supposed to do
😂😂😂
Ksi is so trash
😂😂😂 ksi sucks that's why Jake pay him no attention
I think Jake Paul would k.O ksi
This whole influencer boxing shit is dumb and they are out here robbing idiots who pay to go to these things. Matter of fact, boxing in general is kind of a joke these past 10 years.
Lmao you a pro boxer couldn't beat a youtuber without the help of the judges. Embarrassing performance. Stay off Viddal Riley, he would literally murder you.
Tommy landed a total of 12 jabs the whole fight, with ksi landing more and a point deduction and I’m expect to believe he won 😂   I think they BOTH did absolute CRAP and Tommy and his dickhead fans can’t seriously be proud of this “win” if anything his traditional competitors are looking at the footage and see him as an EASY target.   A draw is more believable. And that is just a FACT.
Si booring
Just watched the first round of this FARCE, couldn’t watch any more , absolute crap,
Good thing their was no illegal moves every cinch like getting hit in the back of the head right 😂
Ksi needa hairstyle with it covering that big ol forehead
Ksi he doesn't have a clue what hi is doing he clinching all the time in s Street fight this will be over in 5 sec
Dude the fact that you didn’t finish this guy says everything
How many times you gonna hit him in the back of the head like fr
Funny seeing ksi cry about punch to back of head when he did it multiple times to that "pro" out of mexico. And then made fun of the dude for complaining about it.  Hilarious seeing ksi cry and complain. I hope everybody clowns on him for a long time
was this a hug party or boxing...this is  the most pathetic thing anyone seen..caIIing it boxing..they are both there to mae $10miIIion they give a shit
😭😭😭😭watched this fight 6 fvcking times how do ppl think ksi won? draw at best idk what ppl are talking about omw
All KSI did was jumping jacks to lunge in and clinch the whole fight
Best clinch match ever 😂
tommy thats so cute , what happend to sayin ksi wont make it past three rounds with you? pro boxer my fkn asshole u had to hit a fifa youtuber in the back of the head MULTIPLE times in a pro match, FURYS GOT CHECKED BY A YOUTUBER HA HA
That was dirty wen tommy punched him in the back of the head, very undeserved win!
KSI's team had planned the clinching / hugging and looks like they were trying to get points deducted from Tommy as the corner man was saying this end of the 2nd round. KSI was terrified, he did not come to fight as he knew he had no chance. here is KSI's corner man giving their game plan away to the cameras: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZq8SfrNy7g
Comments glazing like crazy rn
Why the fuck is KSI moving like MVP
W Tommy for thanking Jesus ✝️
Tommy should not have won that fight It was a draw or even ksi win
You and your family have saved boxing ngl
2 absolute clowns. Ksi is a jungle bunny clown and tom thumb fury is the runt of the fury family. Tommy will sook john fury s peter later. Oxygen thiefs the lot of them
KSI thought it was a hugging match 😂😂
Tommy should have choked him out with all that clinging from ksi
Ksi won
How Ksi keep his hands down and thinks it’s effective tommy read him like a book
U won because u dad paid the refs
Congrats on the win Tommy. He looked like an awkward man to fight against. You did a great job as a boxer. I personally think KSI would be better in MMA than boxing.
Ksi sucks. Wow
KSI is the one clinching!! Robbed my arse
Ksi is fucking joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think Kai dude showed up to the wrong challenge, he should’ve been on dancing with the stars instead cause he ain’t no fighter.
I am not watch this crap it is so sloppy
Ksi is worst boxer ever should be banned from boxing
Ksi loving them star jumps😂🤣😂
Two you tubers up , two you tubers down. Pretty simple huh !😅
LSI looked like a Pineda
Embarrassing to the Fury family that he couldn't even knock him out 😂😂😂😂😂
Ksi with absolutely no defence boxing at all, I'm really not a fan of these Internet fights just makes a mockery of the sport if you ask me, I'd much rather watch a real fury fight than any of this which is why stopped watching in the second round.
looks like a kangaroo
Hugging match
That fight was shit…
Hey guyz FYI, that’s not boxing. Just because you dress up in a boxing outfit doesn’t make you a fighter. (Happy Halloween.)
KSI WON
Tommy you’re a joke, only thing people are backing you for is the fact Ksi was clinching too much but we both know you started most of those by taking his arm after he threw or you threw. Got saved by the fact people don’t want to see a YouTuber win
If this is what they calling box nowdays... Then i'm going to watch plants grow.
that film from ksi LMAOOOOO
KSI doesnt even put his hands up in a stance wtf is he doing 😂
Това бокс ли е ?
This reminds me so much off Floyd mayweather and Logan fight all it was 🤗 a hugging session
Was KSI trained by MVP? That's exactly who he fought like
Hello molly,,lol tell tommy well done,,money in the bank,,enjoy xmas now 😁
Does this even count as a fight? I mean seriously why do these boxers even bother with people like ksi? The guys a youtuber he ain't a boxer, I don't dislike ksi, but I mean cmon if your gonna call yourself a boxer don't just jump around and hug your opponent everytime they throw a punch. This was pathetic. Literally no idea how ksi was even allowed to do this, that'd be like me (who is not a fighter and weighs about 8st) tryna fight Mike Tyson 😂
I dislike JJ, or whatever he's called, even more now! Total horses arse!
Ksi just wanted to hug like a little girl
Lol YouTubers need to fight YouTubers
KSI hugged Tommy more than his dad hugged him
Just in the first round ksi initiated 7 clinches vs tommys 1 clinch. Every round was the same. And people saying tommy was the one hugging😂
Absolutely ridiculous on KSI's part. Talked all that shit about Jake paul losing but at least he was able to stand in front of Tommy jesus
KSI is Wilder levels of cope
Ksi thinks he is mvp😂
this is the silliest fight i’ve seen in a while
The guy thinks he punches as hard as wilder
I wish I hugged my girlfriend as much as Tommy and KSI did
You were both terrible. Also logan. It's time you all stop this circus that's ruining the sport. You all need to go to WWE and leave the sport for adults alone.
who the hell would think ksi would win??
PROTECT THIS HOUSE
If people thought that KSI won the fight they are delusional plus this was not Tommy Fury's best performance by far but he still won so he is happy KSI can't even box facts
Tommy! Don’t know if you’ll see this, but great job, last night, you did your best, and that’s all that matters. Can’t wait to see you return to the ring, God bless you and your whole family!🙏🏻
between this whole fight tommy was the real boxer puting in jabs and range punches ksi was trying to clinch while punching the whole time thats not boxing bud thats mma makes this sport look like a joke embarrassing
Tommy clearly is the better boxer like he said at the end hes not trying to be the next tyson fury he just wants to be the best tommy fury he can be
this was possibly the most anticipated youtube boxing fight this year, and this is what we got when it finally came? I knew some of these fights may be fraudulent...but nothing quite like this.
Happy for you Tommy Ksi was just there for the pay check. He was scared to death of you !
What a waste of time still just long enough to have a 💩
Ksi does a star jump then he hugs thats it
Tommy is still a shiit boxer he new he will never make it professionally,
This is just disappointing to see what’s happened to boxing now
this further proves that youtubers are in over their heads wanting to challenge real fighters….BAHAHAA the only good yt boxer is probably jake paul and that’s something i’d never thought id be saying
What a joke of a night of fake boxing. I hate that piece of shite ksi but he should have won even though he is a disgusting excuse of a human being. Tommy fury..... we love tyson but damn how bad is he? Struggling against these youtube idiots he should be ashamed. You could see tyson wasnt convinced.
Alls Tommy needed to do was back up let him come at him.. let his hands go on the back foot and counter ksi lunges in,,,instead he just lunged in himself  smothered his own work and tied himself in knots,,,making himself look equally as bad as ksi. No idea what advice his corner were giving him but he did not adjust just kept on doing the same, very poor from Tommy , embarrassing even.
Rigged
robbed
Yall are delusional if you think either of them won, this was a shit fight and if you look at the stats, they are damn near EVEN, i wanna see a rematch and a real fight, not a 1 point difference, it shows nothing like this.
KSI is that type of guy that uses only one button in Mortal Kombat.
Weak fight on both sides, but Fury did def punch him in the back of the head twice. Not sure how points work in boxing but in my mind that should’ve been -2 and not just -1 for him. Thus giving KSI the least flex-able W known to man lmao
Sweeping, hugging, sweeping, hugging, what a joke. Boxer vs Non Boxer.
Please somebody tell Ksi this is boxing not wrestling.  😂
KSI go back to your day job... 😂
They just hugged In tire Mach 😂
Damn KSI was missing Simon
12:20 Piss take . Ksi was allowed to keep on hugging. Constant time wasting. Must be frustrating for Tommy. Needed to be at least 8 rounds
What a shitshow. KSI was completly gased out and only went for hugs. And somehow fury forgot how to trow a 1,2 cross to catch a singe clinchattmempt. Embaressing on both sides
this should have been a mma fight the amount of grappling is crazy
And to think, people don't believe that James toney should be allowed to fight?
Hard to watch this crap when you jus come to Jump and hug for your game plan
KSI fights like a girl.  He can't do anything.  Tommy Fury should do real fights, that won't get him anywhere, except money of course.
Unanimous decision everyone
Totally embarrassing. KSI need to stick to selling drinks cause I don’t think anyone he could sell a fight after this garbage. I bet the judges leaned more towards Tommy cause how annoying ksi looked the whole time
Was k.s.i not hugged as a child? He made up it against tommy,lunge them just hug him a 1 douche of a judge called it a draw,tommy does need to work on his counters,he should train an the kronk gym or the dude who flattened manny off of 1 counter Juan Manuel marquez.
Ksi should’ve won end of. My opinion I’ll say what I want! Just because you’ve got a big last name and been fighting all your life don’t mean shit. The judges got it wrong, it’s robbery end of
After skipping thru the whole fight I think I won
Gay
I know Tommy won and all that but as a proffesional boxer winning by 1 point to a youtuber boxer is kinda of emberrassing.
Ksi should've won. Tommy was trying his best to fight dirty and the ref just let it slide everytime. he got a couple punches in there but nothing compared to ksi
Nothing like boxing rich people to entertain the super rich people.
' Śťŕïçķĺý~Çõmè Ďäñçïñģ '~!?~  With Ã " FEW PUNCHES~ HERE & THERE " 😮
😃......... No comment.  But thank u so much for sharing this vid, TOMMY FURY🤟🏻👍🔥💕
Worst fight in history,  ksi clinching  every hit that wasn't expected at all
Anyone that says this is a well deserved tommy win has to be on something heavy. Embarrassing
Well done Tommy ❤ never doubted you bro 👍
Ksi looked like a idiot 😂😂😂
Boxing has become an absolute joke of a sport.
ngl... this was the most boring fight I have ever watched. Neither of them knew about distance 🤦‍♂
What a joke of a fight
You scared of vidal Riley. A pro boxer shouldn’t care about the PPVs.
Ksi was desperate for a hug man
Ksi is worse than a football player 😂 I'm surprised he never started rolling around on the floor never mind just holding his head 🤦‍♀️. He'd be a better ballet dancer with those jumps 😂
At the end of the day, people can think what they want, everyone can have whatever opinion they want. Whether you think either person won it’s time to move on.
a boxer vs a youtuber what did you expect.
That was AN hugging party
It’s a boxing match not a dance recital. Gooo Tommy. The punch in the back of the head was ridiculous it was a push to get the guy off. ❤Australia
The worst fight of all time 😂😂😂😂😂😂  these two are not fighters!
Was this a wrestling match?
Sry but even i am on KSI side Tommy win that fight 💯👊👏 nice fight guy's KSI you have stop training? You fight a lot different you must have skip a lot workouts...
Ksi robbed? 😂
KSI vs Nate Robinson next
Nah im a ksi fan but this match was an L, constantly missing his hooks and clinching shheesh L ksi
Ksi was clinching a lot yh but when he clinched he was throwing some big body shots but Tommy threw a lot of just clean headshots that you could see spun ksi and he deserves to win
between this whole fight tommy was the real boxer puting in jabs and range punches ksi was trying to clinch while punching the whole time thats not boxing bud thats mma
I mean, why is this girl like that, she just jumps and doesn't fight like a woman?He's cheating. Be a man and fight.
boxing is so boring to watch lol
HUG!
You are a YouTube boxer.
BRO FORGOT TO USE HIS ELBOW
why now since ksi everyone hating on tommy fuc k ksi let's go tommy fury
KSI came to hug.
Fury def scored more
Its funny how ksi always wants to win because of pojnt deductions 😂
Boringest shit I’ve ever seen ,there’s no way in hell anyone clenches that much in boxing
The black guy looks and acting as a f..... Bully coward.
Brother of the best boxer in the world, and still throws cheap shots like crazy. Congrats.
watching it back KSI hit Had the powershots by far and i really only saw tommy land one good solid jab and about 3 other shots total. KSI was definitely getting the best of the clinch work aswell
Even though I'm a KSI fan (mostly through his stuff with the Sidemen), there's no denying you are a class act. You were humble in your win and have come across in interviews post match extremely well. KSI on the other hand has come off as a sore loser and ridiculously immature, with a fragile ego to boot. I really hope he sees clearer in a few days time and actively reaches out to you to apologise for his attitude. Hopefully this loss can humble him, at least in the long run. I'm actually happy you won. Continue to stay classy! ;)
Tommy will get some stick for this performance
Pattercake pattercake bakers man
Whole lot of dancing from KSI he just looked goofy yet so confident
This was six rounds right?
The fight is so bad I honestly can't tell who won
Ksi should  remove the boxing gloves and put on puppet gloves ,sooty and sweep comes to mind
The bootleg version of Pacquiao vs Mayweather
I think this has to be a draw
Ksi is a lame
I thought ksi was gonna fly away flapin them chicken wings
Makes me wonder if ksi’s camp was just him hugging his sparring partners for months on end
Hugging doesn’t win fights 😂😂
Tommy can not fight
ROBBED
Are they  trans?
Finally he got humbled, reminded he is just a YouTuber, not an artist, not a boxer.
Ksi turned it into tye huggy huggy game surprised he never kissed tommy
prime is better
I'm a ksi fan but I can't lie Tommy won this JJ was clinching and doing jumping Jax in the middle of the fight (and now I'm ready for people to come after me In the comments😂)
Tommy Fury was build like a machine ready to cause mass destruction when I looked at Tommy bodybuilding transformation, I said KSI ain't ready for all of that he destroyed KSI brains in.
They should put a three clinch per round rule in the contract next time. This was painful, not as painful as hearing the people saying KSI was robbed though.
Ksi wants a hug 😂
Watching it back now I see Ksi hugging every punch😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I thought Ksi won tf was I thinking I think Ksi weird style made it look like he won😂
Ksi=worlds best hugger
KSI really came in there with a kangaroo then hug gameplan
Tommy’s not the best fighter, but he’s far from a fake ass influencer wannabe
KSI should try MMA he looks Dumb boxing😂
joke
Surprised to see so many people saying KSI was robbed. I didn't even watch the fight live, but based on this video it's obvious he wasn't. KSI got a few good hits in, sure. But Tommy was actually showing technique by slipping, blocking, and countering a lot of what KSI was throwing. I don't see this as a win where buddy's strategy was to fight in the clinch.
tommy easily won congrats to him, support him me i dont even like ksi he talked all this crap and does hugging most of the time 😂😂 jake paul would beat ksi
Literally all of Tyson fans are bandwagons and I'm sure he barely won because of his name that he has now completely embarrassed💀
You can see better quality fights in your local Weatherspoon every Saturday for free 🥊
KSI doin' some thug huggin'. Haymaker, thug hug. Repeat.
True love ❤️...dancing ,  hugs .cuddles ...
Why they hugging so much? I thought it was a fight
Old Ref annoying let them fight smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
TOMMY THE WHOLE ROUND WAS JUST HUGGING AND YOU WON BY ONE POINT ONE POINT AND YOU TELL HIM TO GO BACK TO YouTube HE DESTROYED YOU
Both are idiots but tommy won wish it was a double knock out personally
After rewatching the fight, this should’ve been either a draw or Tommy win. KSI was just clinching for dear life and should’ve got a point deducted for excessive clinching
Watching kindergarten fight is more entertaining they were hugging each other the entire time
Would of been frustrating for Tommy, definitely could of got the KO on him but ksi kept clinching. Felt to me that ksi was terrified the whole fight and clinched to avoid being humiliated in front of his entire fanbase.
Like wtf is with all those bunny hopping? Surely would've been much better with his guard up and legs grounded instead of his flappy and and bunny hops no?
Ksi when star jumps and hugging doesn’t win fights😱😱😱😱
Its like ksi isnt even boxing dont know what the fuck hes doing but its shit
i’m not a ksi fan but while i’m watching this the only person i see that’s continuously clinching is tommy
1:45 ksi hits back of the head so fury replies. Then ksi has a big fit and bubble about it, shameful tactics.
Ksi lunge punches than clinches lmao
Ksi, his new name should be THE HEAD. i mean look at the suze of that thing, it has its own gravitational pull.    Ksi head so big that it creates its own solar eclipe.    Ksi head so big that nasa is making it there next destination.    Ksi head so big that they use it as cinema back up screen.   Ksi head so big his licence  head shot comes in a 2 part sequal. Ksi head so big, when it rains crowds gather underneath him.  Ksi head so big that each ear is in different time zones. Mega head.
hugfest
Tommy with the easy money
Idk how anyone says ksi won that 3rd round
This fight just explains why Tommy is ducking Vidal he needs YouTubers with minimum training to both win the match and pull the crowd. He can’t depend on himself to pull off either of those two things.
Tommy showed his right hand after the fight in an interview... it's completely swollen.   Watching it back, Tommy could barely use his right hand. What happened to the combos he hit Jake with? He had one hand against KSI. 😁
It was actually very romantic really wasn't it 😅 18 mins of pure cuddles bless them lol
Is it just my uneducated impression as a filthy casual, or was that ref heavily HEAVILY biased towards ksi?  For how much does a ref go, these days?
Everything was on ksis side and still they call it robbery?😂😂😂
KSI was robbed.
Its called BOXING, its not ballroom dancing, zero defence, chin stuck up in the air, he is very lucky Fury didnt connect properly with a solid right, cuz soft lad would still be sleeping, his corner, instead of telling him to clinch should of been telling him to defend his chin, next time he might not be so lucky, hope this crap gets banned before someone gets seriously hurt!
Knocks real boxers out but can't knock you tuber out give me a break
Tommy you won by one point your not even a good professional boxer
This wasn't a fight nobody did nothing all hugs the whole time come on
KSI think he's Michael Venom Page or something just because he's a black British guy? lol
KSI the GOAT.
KSI bouncing like he The Karate Kid💀
What is ksi doing all that wasted energy for nothing
In round 3 tommy was good but the rest ksi smashed ksi shoulve won
Is ksi in dance match or a boxing match 😳
What’s with the imitation of the funky chicken from Ksi and the ref is terrible .
i think these boxers like tommy pull their punches  have you noticed how none of these youtubers ever get knocked out? real pro fighters get knocked out all the time, but youtubers never do. you can only come to one conclusion and that these are exhibitions not real competitive matches.
ksi hols him with 1 arm then head body head body with the other 😂😂
The fight was robbed i think it should have been a draw becuase tommy did hit ksi at the back of his head
This isn't boxing
He copies other fighters'; style too much. He gotta find his own style.
Ksi busy doing half jumping jacks than boxing
You lost mate Justice will prevail in the appeal
KSI practicing star jumps all fight. Need to keep your hands up son
Really embarrassing fight… if you can call this “fight”. That KSI is not a boxer but a jumping bean! I wouldn’t pay $5.00 for any of his fight!
Your a G
Come on who wouldnt have a punch up for millions  😂😂😂
Jake would fkn destroy ksi and I think Tommy would to in rematch I think ksi weird ass fighting apro really thru Tommy off but it wouldn’t happen twice Ksi training’s hug the heavy bag and try and hit inside fkn joke
ksi is a prime knob head . 😊
like and subscribe if you breathe air
Seen better fights in a school playground - shitshow
Ksi has no right to call himself a boxer! stick to YouTube.
The only round ksi could have won is round 2 he did do soke good work in the clinch in round 2 and landed a shot outside the clinch and round 2 lol good job there but ksi is absolute ass jake paul wasnt grabbing tommy trying to hug him all fight i think ksi mite love tommy fury.
Bro Ksi is trash and the thing that sucks is it made Tommy look worse then he is because ksi kept clinching
Fuck is KSI jumping like a mortal kombat character
Ksi lost what a boring fight
Sprakling boy got many hits on his box
Easy money 🤣
Tommy clearly won that ksi is just a swore looser hes pathetic. well done tommy lad
What just hugging bro?
KSI doesn’t and can’t box. Regardless of his striking powers or lack of etc. He dances, throws a swinging overhand right, then backs off or hugs. He was clinching like a MF. And whilst imo it may not have been Tommy’s best performance, he still deserved the win, over KSI.
Tommy lost the  fight by points you can see it hit clearly in the back of the head four times hits twice when the Bell finished for a boxer he's trash
Jump up and down, then rush in a throw a right, and then grab and hold your opponent.  That was KSI's strategy.
All I can see is a real boxer trying to fight a jumping fool with no technique.. ksi cant fight.. Tommy fury needs to fight real boxers, but hey ho ..easy win easy money!!
Clown stays clown, bro thinks hes mortal combat character IRL 😂
Last time i watched ksi, he swore he learned how to box 😂😂
this guy doing aerobics in the ring lmao! and then throws a tantrum, the whole reason probably why he got so upset was cause he got a tattoo for that fight and on top of that he had a whole script with jake paul when he was gonna win, lmao. ¨I´m going to do what Jake Paul could not do¨ what?! Look silly and lose worse than Jake
What a comedy. KSI must have been on drugs, grabbing the man every chance he gets
KSI got robbed and deep down in your heart you know it
I have never seen this much clinching before
damn thats a boring fight
ksi definitely got robbed. bare minimum a draw
That ref really stinks.
Just give these guys(KSI, Jake & Logan) a real pro boxer. These stupids won't even step in the ring ever again!!  They are just disrespecting the sport.
Ksi was robbed
3:18 lol illegal shot
KSI is flapping like a chicken Econ fault at all the fight was shit and Tommy Fury where is Nautle self The route to the point of Tommy Fitton be on the head Voiding the rift take a points of the kid KSI. He was doing exactly the same thing, but he’s running round and flap in like a chicken disgusting KSI is shit you can’t fight at all.
seeing this after round 1-2 goes to ksi
All these salty people hahauahahaua. Ksi won
Circus!
KSI is still a noob at boxing. Big heart and confidence though. Good luck to him.
I was so unhappy with the way the fight was due to the fact ksi doesn’t know what boxing is. I agree with Tommy fuck all the bullshit an on with fighting real boxers not these YouTuber want to be boxer. By the way heyyyy Tommy boy ❤ you’re stunning I must say.  your wife is very beautiful very good looking couple so I’m assuming the kids will be beautiful as well! Can’t wait for the next fight
poor performance from you, however take the win and work on manipulating the jab in the gym
Celebrity boxing needs to end now
Tommy Fury MOM cheated on JOHN FURY
Ksi ass 😂😂😂
Who tf taught ksi how to box? 🤣🤣🤣
KSI THE GOATTTTT
Embarrassing
KSI THE GOATTTTT
Look at all these is haters
I wish this was jake vs tommy 2. That would have been a much better fight to watch. I always wanted jake to fight ksi but now i hope he never does... it would be infuriating to watch this style vs jake or anyone else for the matter
Tell me is looking like the runt of the litter box, intelligent in the family, he should be knocking everyone out in the first round if he’s about it
I am a professional boxing judge for 5 years and this was not Tommy fury win it was either a draw or ksi win because Tommy kept on hitting the back of his head and should at least 5 point take away for Tommy I think the match result should get overturned
Surely people see ksi try’s to hit with the elbow at 12:39
Tommy fury is not as good as he claims to be. Saying hes a professional boxer since a yohng kid.... Why is he fighting people who are not boxers?
Why was he doing jumping jacks?
Ksi wanna hug it out.
Haha thank you? You mean sorry stop this misfits crap
Bunch of p*ssies in the comments who’ve never fought a man in their lives lmao, how about you try and box someone with 80 inch reach
That was terrible boxing match
This isn't the SUPALEK SUPERFIGHT but I will recognize when an organization publicly releases their own PPV's as meaning something. In this case meaning KSI got embawassed. Not even going to watch the fight even if EU Boxe is my preferred since the Hatton Circuit.  Yea fuck PRIME.
KSI is a shit boxer and your supposed to be the “proper boxer”So you say! So how shit does that performance make you !!!
Ksi just pathetic
Who can get a count on how many times ksi was hit in the back of the head also ksi was not the only one clinching I think that was a draw
Enough pissing about now Tommy let’s see you in a boxing match
Ppl really paid to watch go to gym watch sparring for free better than this
Ksi won
Why didnt he use his albow
Ksi  269/269 jumping jacks 5/10 Jabs
Just can’t believe fury is still taking these kinda fights and that he cant KO KSI
KSI out here doing jumping jacks the whole time😂
cant believe anyone would have paid to see this utter shit fest
If you watch the fight after the 2nd round ksi corner kept telling ksi to double jab. When he would attempt to jab Tommy’s jab was faster and would snap ksi head back literally happened throughout the whole fight so idk how they counted low jabs from tommy when he was landing them clean
ksi was robbed he had tommy in the bag
Good win. its obvious and a fair win. Well done Tommy. KSI, you tried, you did good
I've seen better fights in my primary school playground, this bulls**t needs to end we gotta stop letting these guys in the ring and embarrassing the sport, you sold your soul to the devil Tommy, money is the root of evil
As much as I love KSI I've been waiting for the day he gets silenced I've always watched his videos from the start but when it comes to fighting its diffrent I'm an amateur boxer and seeing KSI get gifted his way onto the Boxing Scene annoyed me and especially with him saying all this talking all that he needed a lesson he needed an understanding of you can't just get your own way all the time and that has been proven as he kicked off like a 7 year old throwing a tantrum the fight wasn't the best Tommy didn't seem like he was really going for it more just a stick and move type of style but u can't do much when JJ just runs and hugs you and Swings those daft haymakers but yeah as a KSI fan I will say he needed this L to close his mouth a bit and get a bit of a education that u can't get what u want all the time he learned that life's not fair he should stick to the music and content its best for him fighting is a diffrent ball game
pity the poor sods who paid to see it .
I think ksi thinks he's in a street fight..... That he would also be doing very badly at 😂
This reflects badly (not financially) on Tommy.
Congrats you went toe to toe with a YouTuber
Nobody: Ksi : 🤺🤺🤺🤺🤺 🫂🫂🫂🫂 🤺🤺🤺🤺🤺🫂🫂🫂🫂
Jumping jack ksi 🎉 i cudnt watch after first round !! Tommy needs to learn to jab ! I never wanna watch another fight ever involving influencers again
one of these men is a pro boxer, his brother is one of the best heavyweights to ever live and he should have starched the other , smaller fella who star jumps and has a big slap-head … what a shit show
The fight was so bad to watch becuz of KSI  fighting like a bit..h
Yes Tommy ❤️
Hate that referee he was on KSI side he not supposed to be on any
KSI must’ve trained hugging with Devin Haney and Floyd Mayweather.  Excessive clinching is illegal but is rarely penalized.  It makes boxing unwatchable.
I AM FAIR TO BOTH. KSI DID NOT DESERVE A WIN, TOMMY DID NOT EITHER. TOMMY MADE ILLEGAL PUNCHES, KSI KEPT HOLDING. RESPECT TO BOTH FOR FIGHTING BUT THIS IS BOXING. IF THEY REALLY LOVE THE SPORT THEY WILL BOTH BE HONEST WITH EACHOTHER AND REALIZE NO ONE WON. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SPLIT DECISION. NOBODY WON. REMATCH PLEASE. I LOVE BOXING. I LOVE BOTH KSI & TOMMY.
Good shit, my goat.
Is the ref a youtuber aswell. Why is he letting them hug for so long
Haha and this guy wants to be world champ, I’ll tell u one thing, you’ll always be remembered for barely beating ksi. a “professional boxer” couldn’t put down in tommy words, “a fifa YouTube kid” haha what a laughing stock and man couldn’t even adjust to ksi movements and kept hitting him in the back of the head 😂
What I’ve noticed with KSI is whenever he throws a power punch he goes and hugs every single time whether he misses or not
I'd love to talk to Tyson about this hugging  game 💯  @miketyson
Bad boxing tho
Ksi keep puttin his head down like that gunna end up with a bad knockout
Keeps clinching but complaining of getting hit in the back of the head. Your own fault for making the choice to fight that way.
Fixed
I came in thinking well ofc ksi lost to him tommy is better in every way but I watched it and saw that ksi won surprisingly
Dude I would beat ksi up so bad
Weird that the ‘real’ footage hasn’t been posted.
Strictly Come Dancing has gone downhill a bit
Tommy should fight Eddie Hall or thor?
The hugging game is weak 💯
Its just shit. -SHIT.
'And he was just grabbing meee' lol he was the one doing that. It was either dancing around at 2m distance or closing in and hugging
Good job Tommy for not letting ksi and these refs in his pocket frustrate you into making mistakes.
And peoples went to buy tickets for this 🤡🤡 Congratulations, 😂😂😂😂 spectators also 🤡🤡🤡
Fury is definitely more skilled and experienced and that's exactly why I wonder why he did so many illegal back of the head shots and even a sucker punch after the bell For a full time fighter like him resorting to tricks like that...
The most awkward person for a boxer to box is someone that can’t box!
Someone drop Timestamps of tommy highlights
2:02 some kid said "GO ON TOMMY, BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HIM" got me dying 😂😂
WTAF.....Was that I'm lost for words hahahahahahahahahahahaha
Ksi gameplan: make Molly jealous by cuddling Tommy more than she's been able to during fight camp...
Ksi absolute clown what an annoying opponent but a win a win ✌️👌
Damn whats up w the clinching 🙄
Only casuals will think it's a robbery. KSI took his bets on a power punch and clinch for the whole fight. Tommy trying to get out the clinch and box was what I was seeing. More consistent jabs landed throughout the whole fight rather than a burst in the first few rounds.  Was close though but still not a robbery and deserved win.
I just skipped around the whole video. Every spot KSI is grabbing on Tommy 😂  Who said he was robbed?
KSI put Tommy to shame. Decision win over a youtuber. Hardly the KO we were promised. Think someone needs to bring a paternity test to the next weigh in for Tommy.
I appreciate it’s hard to box against someone not boxing back, but if you have aspirations of being world champ, this is not anywhere close to the level of a potential champion. Difficult viewing. Go again
Ksi threw more puches that landed, tommie is meant to be a professional boxer but didn't show much boxing skill, KSI definitely won the fight in my eyes
I did not know KSI was this bad at boxing
Man skipped out the first round 😂😂😂
Ksi embarrassed himself. That was pathetic. All he did was bounce up and down with his hands down, then go in for the hug. Then proceed to punch solely from the clinch. Idiot
bro imagine if it was a street fight and KSI tried to cover his face like that 😐
KringeSI might be one of the worst boxers I’ve ever seen. Someone led him to believe his little hoppy jumping jack move is impressive… so, so bad.
KSI is actually shockingly bad at trying to box.
Tommy must of thought he was back in Love Island the amount of hugging going on
KSI wanted a wrestling match and got mad when he got hit on the back of his head. Perhaps stop huggging.
His forehead looked mad crazy in this fight, I was more so entertained by that than the fight itself 🤣🤣
For tommy to be claiming he been boxing his entire life and have this performance is almost embarrassing for him. Winning by split decision and some claiming it was robbed is crazy  especially for pro boxer. Top of that his heavier and longer reach than  ksi too. Should’ve been lights  out KO.  Either not like I can do better congrats big man. Atleast you won.
KSI GOT ROBBED!!
*Bounce* *bounce* *bounce* step forward.. overhand right.. hug.. weak punches to body and back of head.. Ksi entire fight
This was the gayest thing I’ve seen and I’m not even gay
No hate To any of these guys, they did not win it should have been a draw. Then referees were Smoking. "I will plough through you"- Tommy Fury "I hit like a Truck" - KSI. Didn't see nothing all it was hugging (mostly by JJ).
All Ksi did was run away and clinch
As someone who was rooting for JJ, I can easily say I'm disappointed. Did Tommy win, maybe maybe not. What I learnt from KSI is that all that "Stamina" and "Strength" he supposedly has suddenly vanished this fight. Definitely should've been a 8 round fight and I honestly never want to see KSI to calling himself a good boxer again because he just isn't anywhere close.
KSI looking like he's dancing at a festival on molly trying to give out free hug lol
Nicely done Tommy 💪🏻
0:30 already 2 punches behind the head by ksi lmaooo
Get humbled rat
Not gonna talk on the fact KSI wasn’t even boxing he was more street fighting watch how he throws the punches it’s not what they do in boxing, not like that. He lost for a reason.
This is not even boxing it's hugging fight. I expected tommy to TKO Ksi who is youtuber but sad to see real boxer fail to knockout YouTuber
Ksi had he head down hiding 😶‍🌫️ in Tommy chest 😂
You did not deserve to win you should have had a ton of points deducted ksi shouldve won make a rematch happen
Boring ass fight
Pretty boring tbh
You really shouldn’t be proud of this, if you have any sense at all, fight people like Vidal, who have shown and proven their skills instead of stalemating with influencers
Why the fuck did he hit the back of his head ? 1:46 and 3:17 ? And how come none of you people realized this ?
KSI don't got to anymore rings please. You are not a boxer in the least. This was bad comedy.
Looks like he loves you a lot. He is hugging you in every action 🤦‍♂️. Otherwise he knows what is happening
Ksi or jj or who ever he is  hes got more names than prince cant box keeps holding wont stand toe to toe fury won EASY
The way ksi moves almost thought was a dance battle!😅
Ksi can’t fight for shit
This is exactly why inexperienced fighters don’t fight in front of such a big crowd. It just ends up boring to watch as they don’t have the acquired skill you get from working your way up.
Has anyone ever told KSI to hold his hands up when fighting? His stance with his arms down you’d think he was a karate fighter. Joke that these f’ing YouTubers get professional fights.
KSi seems so scared haha
good wrestling match
Youtubers fight...boring miged head know only 1 move
Jumpy Jumpy jump!
Ksi is a complete waste man he is just embarrassing truly waste of time for you Tommy
what fans LOL
ksi thought he was in rugby match
How is it in every fight that KSI somehow manages to complain about a back of the head shot
ksi trying his god damn hardest to not actually fight and survive the rounds cause he knows his career will be dead if he doesn’t, somehow people actually buy into this shit and believe it, boxing is dead… youtubers are literally ruining boxing… but tbh boxing was already heading that way
Ksi has the dumbest form I have seen. Would love to see him get knocked out in a fight
Tommi is such a worthless fighter. Training all his life and barely win, lol.... What did he even do all these years of training? Should be easy to knock anyone out....
You couldn't know him down and you are still feeling a real boxer?
This is what boxing has come to ? What a joke . Sloppiest fight I've ever seen..
Influencer boxing is so bad all they do is sit yhetr and grab. So trash non of theses influencers can actually box
Why so many clintch???!!!!
Terrible fight. All y’all did was hug each other. Y’all must’ve got real close after hugging each other for 20 mins straight 😂
I believe was more draw
Fury son'd ksi xD
12:32 KSI goes for the elbow watch carefully lol
Ksi won this fight
robbed
I understand ksi would be difficult to box, but tommy being a professional should of  💯 laid him out
well done tommy, hope you see this. proper proud of you mate you deserved the win
Next thing we know KSI gonna start a company with tommy fury lmao
Karate style KSI
First in my eyes tommy looks better in most of the rounds put pressure but i watched it again and counted landed punches and i count 35 -26 for ksi soo he actially got robbed here
Ksi doin jumping jacks
He was holding on for the full fight. That’s all his coach was telling him in the corner stay in the clinch.  Keep going Tommy lad stick at it
Wtf is with all that bouncing around? One good punch and he knew he was going down.
Dude really grabbed fury the whole fight….
This is an absolute circus 🎪
Ksi can't fight for shit 😂😂😂😂😂 man kept hugging every second of every round 😂😂😂😂
Ksi needed to change the style, wtf was that jumping around shit, rushing with the right overhead and then clinching. It’s easy to read after round 1. I’m pretty sure that he doesn’t use that style in sparring sessions. Congratz to Tommy, clear win 🥇
You should be disqualified for clinching that much. Wtf?
Cuddling contest, absolute disgrace to the name of boxing.
Must be so proud @tommyfury couldn't even kock out a computer player...😅
KSI PUNCHES HIMSELF 1:43
Ksi keeps jumping like a fornnite character 😂
W BROTHER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHUTTING THIS YOUTUBER DOWN 😂
How the hell you managed to fight him when hes hanging of you like a monkey ill never know you did amazing
K.s.i has to change his name to care bear 🐻.. only wants to cuddle
Ksi ran and cuddled the whole match 😂😂😂
Ksi will do better in bjj than boxing.
But when they clinched they WERE THROWING HAYMAKERS
Tommy you are better than these clowns, you outclassed ksi and boxed while ksi tried to do some kind of stand wrestle because he gassed himself jumping around.
Ksi needs to quit, smh.
Ksi cant fight
Ksi might of won if he was boxing and not doing karate
Jesus 1 - knowledge 0
18:06 did ksi hit himself??
Erm ... ref...ddo the words "Break" mean anything? Awful... truly awful
THE AMOUT OF PPL JUST chatting shit about KSI is soo fking dumb , broo your "PRO BOXER" gets punched on face by a "YOUTUBER" , TOMMY you boxed well but did not deserve the win , KSI was a winner or the match was just a draw at most . As KSI said "TOMMY YOU ARE A PRO BOXER AND I AM A YOUTUBER" . Tommy fans are just some 12 year old kids . Nooo hate to tommy but KSI for the wim 🤌🏻
To be honest jake paul vs tommy fury was a better fight than this!
Feel sorry for anyone that paid for these fights wtf
Let's watch them go 12 rounds😂😴😴😴 probably the worst fight I've ever witnessed! Every round a replay. I've had better fights with my misses. Saying all the that! What gullible people we all are, the tv rights and promoters paying these below par people fighting. By the way I watched this fight here, just out of interest of how 💩  they really are.
KSI sucks
What a joke! That looks like a dumb exhibition dance more than a fight👍🏻
controls for ksi - up up up up up up(jumping), circle(stupid swing), r1 and L1( hugging)
You barely could hold up, all that talk about showing who the true boxer is. LOL
I didn’t see any fight all I saw was just hugging 🫠
I just skipped through this and at EVERY single part I landed on they were hugging lmfaoooo
I'm over the moon with your win tommy,  im so proud I could burst well done❤
1:50 Tommy avenging all of KSI’s opponents especially Pineda😂😂
Bro how tf people accually think KSI won? Bro thought he was in a hugging contest
No wonder Ksi looked tired he beat the world record for most star jumps
Worst boxing match in history
W
KSI looked knackered, I think his lambo broke down and he had to push it to the venue. 🤪
KSI is a bigger joke than his forehead.   KSI letting that huge head write checks that he can't cash. KSI out here doing jumping jacks instead of throwing punches.
Ksi stood by prime on this fight. A load of shite.
I wonder how people feel about going and paying so much money to watch a amateur clinch all night and throw wide punches like donkey Kong
TOMMY FURY V LOGAN PAUL!!
Tommy lost
I feel bad how Tommy has made his team delete all the negative comments
This is impossible to watch…this is terrible🤮 A semi pro boxer vs a jumping jack YouTuber 🤦🏻🤣🤣🤣 Did someone pays for this horse sh….t ?? Me definitely not🤣
Congrats on the victory. You nuked that ksi into oblivion.
Like a fucking wrestling match......yawwwnn
Strictly come Boxing KSI should go into ballroom dancing
Ksi won
If u skip every 10 seconds Ksi is clinching
You can tell who is the real boxer and who is a YouTuber. Wtf is up with the jumping jacks??? Horrible. Tommy deserved the win 100%
Anyone who fights or boxes knows if they pull star jumps then pull the jab in between. and it’s a shame Tommy didn’t knock him out for such shit foot work. And also a shame he didn’t see it as an obvious win.
kSI what are dirty boxer😮
it's absolutely impossible for Tommy to throw his jabs bcs Ksi immidiately throw his jab, simultaneously jumping to hug and Clings till the Referee separate them. So any way a sweet win.
L. 👮🏼‍♂️ 🏦 💰
🎯
I really like Tommy but he needs to  take his boxing to the next level if has any future
Ksi the serial hugger😅
Dude thought it was a karate match
Why was he flapping his arms around like a demented chicken ?
Did someone tell the black guy it was a breakdance an hugging competition
Ksi won
Ksi is hopping around like he's Conor McGregor and what's with all the clinching can we get some good boxing please! tommy needs to stop fighting YouTube fighters he's way above this.
1:25 punched himself
KSI brother you were just hugging. That's not boxing
Hug fest
Ksi is a plum
U lost to a YouTuber tbh 😂😂😂
Tommy your crap
KSI a boxer???? He better stick to YouTube!!!
Ref was allowing KSI to cuddle and hit. The stats would be very different if that wasn’t the case.
Robbed
Ksi kept dancing like a flappy bird 😂😂😂😂😂
The fuck is ksi doing? That's not boxing...
This is a joke😂😂
That crowd was insane. So loud!
Boxing has become a joke Tommy is a dosser
Okay I seen ksi hit the back of head with no penalty. Tommy definitely won.
lmao how can people even dare say ksi won this shit, he's only jumping around, holding and milking the back of the head shot.. wtf
#Rigged
My god why is his guard still down
KSI strategy:  1)feint bravado with a Michael Venom Page Kickboxing stance from a safe distance,  2)close distance with one wild swing attempt,  3)immediately grab and hold on to opponent until ref separates you two  4)rinse and repeat
The hugging lowkey on both of them tho. fury was initiating them too come on now y'all
Fun fact: If you skip to any minute of this video, they will be hugging
Stupid Ref should have deducted points from KSI from clinching so much.
You Lost Tommy and you know it, Just letting KSI get to the end was a loss,  imo it was a draw! went all rounds twice with Youtubers lol.
Ksi tryin so hard to be ConorMcGregor and the only he achieved was duplicate Conor’s stance and gas tank lol
Ksi is whining,clinching and doing jumping jacks. 🤷
KSI smoked em!
I just don't see it, KSI only won one round. Making it 59 - 55. But Tommy should not have just been deducted points in R2, but for R3, R5, and R6 when he punched behind the head, putting him at 55 - 55 for a draw. Even if you take the official score cards I feel Tommy should have been deducted more points because he wouldn't stop hitting KSI in the back of the head. So on the official scorecards he should have lost imo. This was embarrassing for both of them and I wanted Tommy to win.
You lost 😂
ive seen drunk people give more of a scrap than KSI lol what a joke.
Tommy won. No comments 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Good get these internet clowns tf outta here
Tommy won but he don’t deserve it for a boxer of his talent and someone who’s been boxing all his life he doesn’t deserve the win this should’ve been a draw
Ksi professional clincher can please someone knock I'm out cold
Ce gars (KSI) devrait aller chez MMA/UFC, il nous mène un combat de boxe très moche. Je me demande si en vertu de quoi il voulait qu'on le déclare GAGNANT 😮
Didn’t watch the fight, heard it was a robbery, after seeing this…. Wtf are people talking about?? Ksi didn’t do a damn thing lol
Thus sport become a circus 🎪..
Y’all should call this crap. The hugging contest. People actually pay to watch this crap.
Ksi fights like the kids in my gym 😂😂😂
KSI throwing wild overhand rights that are closer to Tommy's back of the head then anything else.  Punching to the back of Tommy's head while clinched the same as Tommy was, but acts all dramatic and gets a point taken from Tommy when they were both doing it.  He still lost though. He should never box again that was embarrassing.
I expected more from you
well done tommy
This actually looks disgraceful what if the clenching is a conscious tactic to try and win its such a low form of boxing ksi shouldn't be allowed to box and fake that he is at a high level when he is not. How much money did he use to buy support of pay people off. You see chorographed moves from people around that could have also been tactics to distract.
Ksi is just ridiculous
In what world did tommy win that fight? Roberry
Okay who here think ksi should stop boxing and be honest now.
I spent more time skipping the clinches than actually seeing a fight. How can you not be embarrassed showing up to a fight and clinching at the slightest hint of engagement. Ksi is a coward who only showed up to put his drink on display to a large audience. He has no principles, just a sad pathetic lust for money and attention.
I have no idea what I've just watched do people really consider this thing boxing
Boxing is Tommy’s main Mission Boxing is a Side Quest for KSI
the amount of tommy cockriders in these comments are crazy. how are yall gonna ignore the multiple back of the head shots. in all fairness it should have been a draw
For tommy firing being a pro, and you can't knock out an amateur lmao fuckin bum!
Is this boxing??
you really wanted that knockout and I can't blame ya lol,grats on the win.
Ksi can’t fight. That was garbage
Thank you for finishing these YouTubers
The referee keeps blaming Tommy for clinching when it's actually KSI who's clinging everytime he can't dodge Tommy's punches. That's ridiculous
Bunch of love island fans over here
Wtf was this a hugging match 😂
You absolutely stank brother you should not be fighting professionals ever.
Well done Tommy 👍
Ksi looked like a pub fighter
Ksi is to scared all he does is to much then wants to clinch....sad to say jake paul will beat him down....and I hate Jake paul
Ksi is a cocky bastard when he boxes. He never protects his face and always taunts his opponents.
The Ref fell for KSI's bullshit about back of the head punches.  KSI was doing it himself then crying about  getting it back.  NOW if it was a star jump competition KSI won.  But it was Boxing, and that clown cant Box for shit . well done Tommy
Tu devrais normalement perdre ; comment veux tu que les juges te prennent au sérieux alors que toi-même tu ne prends pas le combat au sérieux ?
What happened to round 6??, it goes 1-2-3-4-5 then shows round 1 again??
HES SO SALTY
This is the weakest fight I've ever seen, both of them just throw 3 punches and grab each other like 2 girls
What a completely shite carry on. Congratulations Tommy Fury for being able to earn a ton of money from a nothing boxing match 👏🏼👏🏼
if only tommy would have followed a right in 14:58
Ksi the hugger 🫂
The fights in the comment section are better than the actual fight!
This reminds me of when a boxer has a match vs a karate black belt or some other non-boxer.  KSI is a complete embarrassment.  Tommy should've never been deducted a point and the ref should've done a better job stopping all the clinching initiated by KSI.  A lot of it wasn't even clinching but wrestling.
The most fluid and most natural thing ksi does is clenching which he must have actually trained to do by the looks of it.
Ksi isnt a boxer, hed be better off on strictly. More entertainment in a circus
To be honest, KSI's fighting technique is just horrible. You call that proper boxing? I can't watch him fight all day, horrible just horrible
Why did KSI use a karate stance? Bro is emulating MVP
Tommy almost got the knock down 6:45 18:40
Too much hugging
clinching is the new boxing?
ksi best hugger in boxing
KSI might be the worse boxer of YouTube fighter.
Also saying here, the dazn ppv quality was amazing they should post the full fight with ALL angles to watch again, I paid for it, watched it yesterday live, I want to watch it again and watch tommy again fighthing, hopefully it will be on YT soon
4-2 Tommy.
There should be taken points for clinching  And KSI did it after every jab and attack u did He clinched every 2 sec and he started punching u in back of head first But every 1 say KSI "won" but ur true winner Congrats
KSI kept wrapping his arm around Tommy's back clinching for dear life he started majority of hugging.  Every swing KSI did that missed was followed with a clinch to avoid getting countered. KSI get's caught after clinches several times. Tommy pressures KSI onto the ropes. Tommy controlled the fight. KSI went for a swing and clinch and landed a few inneffective shots that barely grazed him. KSI lost and claims robbery actual clown.
Ksi obviously initiated the grabbing and clenching everytime what a joke to even call this boxing he runs into grab tommy to defend the punches pathetic its boxing not grappling or wrestling
should of been a draw
0:06 Ksi: hé kept on punching me in the back of my head Also Ksi:
Also...WELL WELL DONE Tommy posting the full-fight, that's says a LOT about you as your professionalism. Showing it to everyone even people that could't afford it, and also showing everyone the fight to check it again, and also this will bring more people to the channel, well done
yall saying he was jumping and clinching like the clinch wasnt to get inner shots.. he was using the same fighting style for faze but when it tommy, “oh thats all he was seen doing.”tuh, lets be real.. before the judges even said the score everyone felt ksi won, scored outrageously.. tommy is even embarrassed by his preformance and doesnt even wanna see it , puhleese
Considering Tommy considers himself a pro boxer ksi done well to not get knocked out or is Tommy not as good as he thinks. When is he going to fight a real boxer?
Bloody he'll thought I was watching strictly come dancing
Let them go bare knuckle if KSI thinks this is boxing. It’d be a much better fight
Ksi is pathetic and so is Logan paul
Ksi hugged the man every time he was about to get rocked
Bro wtf is this fight so much clenching
Tommy, please make a video titled "Laughing At: KSI" to sum everything up.
What a joke that was, Tommy was wanting to box, but that KSI as next to no style and a lack of experience, just hugging, because he can't box, then winged every time he got hit on the head. Tommy wo that by a long shot too. I think KSI only got about 10 clean shots "if that" the whole fight.
Why Tommy took this fight is beyond me smh
I want to be honest, I watched Tommy fight vs Jake Paul and I enjoyed it more in terms of boxing, this fight was very very weird with this cuddles, it was scrappy..I AM NOT CRITICISING TOMMY, NOT AT ALL,  I am just saying the fight in terms of boxing was weird like I didn't understand why they were all the time so so near each other, I don't know anything about boxing, but it was a weird fight. I wanted to enjoy it more in terms of boxing technique and it was weird. I enjoyed it a lot though and I was sending my best wishes for Tommy!!
Money grab. Clinch fest.
JJ was really milking those back of the head hits so he could win by point deduction
Tommy needs to rematch. this was not a win for either fighter. If anything KSI should have won by the point deduction as he won rounds 1 2 and 6. regardless if it did end that way there should still be a rematch. If KSI won by the point deduction Tommy should rematch. same should be done here
Robbed..
Ksi got robbed
Bruhhhh… Ksi looking like he’s doing jumping jack drills.
People that saying KSI was robbed remind of an angry feminist on gay parade .
KSI ran in for a hug everytime, I didn't see one clean punch. This was so embarrassing to watch
Ksi needs to give the boxing up and try strictly come dancing😂
What the f is Ksi doing?       Jumping & cuddling
Boring fight
KSI kept hugging. He kept wrapping his arm around Tommy's back. Tommy always has his hands in front of KSI's face. KSI gets caught he clinches. Look at 6:53 for example happening over and over again
To think people paid to see this shit is a joke
The people that think ksi won do not understand fighting ksi is a literal trash can
I am from Argentina, and bought PPV yesterday to watcht the fight, and went all over the process from Molly's and Tommy's videos on YT, posts on IG, interviews on the journey previous the fight. OMG I understand Molly, if my boyfriend was under this pressure and in such a difficult and high risk sport, I would be so nervous. I watched the fight from beginning to end, I was speaking out loud in my living room "come on tommy!" "you have this tommy" "this is your career not youtube, you deserve this" hahaha I wanted Tommy to win, and I am SO happy he did!!  The pressure is very high. I want to watch the fight again. I watched it yesterday on DAZN PPV, the 4K quality was amazing. Thanks for posting it here Tommy, I spent 20 USD for me this was = 20,000 argentinian pesos. My boyfriend was like, do you like boxing? And I was like, THIS fight I want to watch, and now because of Tommy I learned what a difficult career it is, very high pressure, and HIGH risk for brain trauma.
Ksi can’t box that’s what it is 😂😂😂😂
JJ got robbed
Rip to those who thinks this is a robbery😂
Ksi had his hands down the entire fight and tommy couldn’t even connect with one punch tommy took a L on this fight Jake wins next fight don’t @ me
Tommy the Goat
was ksi trying to wobble Tommy from the clinch??.. anyway.. looks like the ksi is more about wearing skirts and doing jumping jaxx in the ring more over than boxing. in his defense though, I think tommy lost this fight morally. How you can miss a forehead like that, through 6 rounds, is a mystery to me. i swear i could land a 518 yard hole-in-one given a target like that...🤨 Tommy needed to wipe the floor with ksi, and he just didnt show up and demonstrate that he has that sort of skillset. Second time he showed up and admitted he underperformed. if he cant show up against guys like Jake and KSI,... hes not going to show up for Conor. ill tell you this rn. p.s please dont kick my ass, tyson, for saying this, lmao. GEETTUUHP!! you hone the Gypsy Soul! 12:38 nice
More like a hugging contest both usless
Love how he released the fight for free considering it was not very good and he is a good man for that
It’s just his style jumping around, why you guys Dont understand. But still he land clean punch. Tommy dont land any clean punch lol
Today's boxers are so silly .. this is like a wrestling match always hugging all the time haging.. did anyone see a boxing fight??both bums...
ksi is a shit venom page, Fact
What a weird sequel to Brokeback Mountain
Let ksi do a rematch he got this
Ksi a joke
Fury was just the better boxer obviously he’s a professional, Ksi has fought influencer after influencer but never someone on tommys level so how people watch this and think KSI won is fucking beyond me
Ksi won
He hardly touched him behind the head what a joke
KSI tastes the real boxer punch😂
Tommy throwing mang punch but not land then win joke
All we saw was KSI afraid of Tommy hitting him and clinch Tommy like a slut on a pole.
none of you guys get boxing jumping is a fighting still its mind games i boxs my self i saw the score codes jj win that or at lest a draw none of you get get boxing and the clinch he was going for body shots what is good against a tall guy like tommy fury
Only people that were robbed were the people who paid to watch this shit
bro ksi is doing an African dance the whole fight wtf
KSI wasn't landing in the many clinches? Looks like it to me
If you Rematch him, do it at 10 rounds in an officially sanctioned fight with a proper ref lol he won't like that 🤣🤣
The amount of behind the head punches from ksi was shocking and they called a point from fury funny that refs blind as a bat 😂
man ksi is over-hugging,try to quench everytime.its annoying fro the viewers
Ksi gay he can't fight
KSI is a joke just dancing around and tying up lol. no skills verse a real boxer! he knows he doesnt have a chance
ksi needs a better coach 😂
KSI edged it on this he got the style and everything spot on against a traditional boxer who likes to just jab. Appeal will come through 🙌
Wth happened to ksi, he looked much better before but now he’s just fucking around wth
Yeah ksi definitely lost
Ksi turned into Luis Pineda here
1 round: KSI 2 round: KSI (-1Tommy) 3 round: Tommy 4 round: Tommy 5 round: Tommy 6 round: KSI
The only thing that was robbed was his hairline 😅
You rob ksi
WELL DONE TOMMY LOVE FROM 0161 ALWAYS YOU WON MY FRIEND!!!
It’s sad how boxing has just become a hugging sport, glad Tommy won but man was this a crap fight 😂
Tommy fury standing there like an idiot after blatantly hitting KSI in the back of the head
Jj got robbed, aint no way bro is proud of this. wait till it gets overturned
For the people who really thought KSI could win, you're too much of a fan to see clearly.
Lmao KSI really got no clue what he doing. His trainers got to go.
from this angle ksi is just doing star jumps, jab, right hook, clinch while tommy was trying to time him. no clean shots from tommy but a few from ksi, in the clinch he did better. ksi wins this but awful fight to watch
Personally daylight robbery and a draw at best
If this is boxing this is disappointing all I saw was hugging and love taps I've seen people fight better in street beefs 😂
Theres only 1 real way to fight and thats to forget all defense and swing
Tommy needs to learn to throw elbows from clinch. Anyway, glad he won.
Terrible fight
Well done "Cheers" from Kentucky USA
Christ, it looks even worse from this angle. I’ve never in my life seen somebody hug every single round, every single punch & not lose a single point. Embarrassing refereeing & embarrassing tactics from KSI - at least Jake boxed 😄🤣
How do people think ksi was robbed? Tommy was clearly more active even during all the clinching he was more active ksi spent more time hopping around
Why does ksi fight like that, bouncing around with his left hand extanded?
This aint boxing this is just  hugging tf???
Most boring boxing match I've ever seen
u got it done
Y'all saying Ksi fans are delusional but here y'all are sucking this mediocre boxer off, Tommy didn't deserve that win Ngl. At best a draw
Like how do you even box an idiot like ksi he just jumps aroumd like an absolute idiot the whole time.
Why is Ksi coming in with the michel venom page points fighting stance like it’s actually going to help him he’s clueless on how to box and as for Tommy yea was a difficult fight to get into with someone throwing mad shots and just wanting hugs all the time but I do feel like if he moves backwards and threw some stiles he could of possibly ended ksi is what it is well done on the win lad
Ill give 1 thing to Ken he gives amazing hugs huh tommy lol?
I knew it
KSI WHAT HAPPENED 😂😂😂😂😂
Ksi is a joke all these guys are a joke. I understand its crazy money too fight these fools but damn its lame. Much respect Tommy.
the fucking ref wants knocking out,good on you tommy clear win
to be fair some of those back head shots looked really soft and jj was basically throwing himself into him while he was shooting shots so no wonder that some of those went like that
KSI needed to be humbled. Well done. Let s go Manchester!!❤
First off the judges should have taken off 5 points second of all Tommy dad probably bribed the judges ksi through very critical punches he won
Problem with these YouTubers , they do a bit of training and think they can box . Fury always looked the better boxer no matter how he performed. Ksi did more star jumps and grabbing than actually boxing . Hopefully now the YouTubers can stick to fighting YouTubers .
Ksi should've won even though it was a very bad fight barely anypuncges but Tommy won even though he hit the back of the neck/head a few times😬😬
Tommy "The Hugger" Fury
How the heck are you gonna go from round 5 and jump back to round 1 smh, that’s bullshit! Horrible video!
But ksi said he can see John Cena
You can literally skip to almost any part of this video and they are holding.
KSI thought it was a hugging game 😂
Circus show all
KSI only landed blows when wrapping up. He can’t trade shots like a man. Super embarrassing
KSI pussio
Literally no fighting from ksi here. Tommy looks frustrated that they’re just hugging
Professional boxer mind, punching him in the back of the head? absolute shambles, ksi won that.
Ksi can’t stop cuddle u mate 😂 Give him a hug back
To be fair this is better footage than you get on the BBC or ITV.. Nice one.. KSI's whole game was to jump about and try and throw a bomb.. lol fuckin clown. Just a shame Tommy never knocked him spark out.
Those who think that youtube celebrities like Paul brothers and KSI bring attention to boxing and are therefore a good thing for this sport, now just think again, is this kind of youtuber really good for the sport, or is it just good for themselves? YouTube Boxing and their fangirl followers are literally killing boxing and dumbing down the world. Ppl should have seen it today right?
Tommy you need to rematch ksi and show everyone that was just off night and show you cam get these YouTubers out there mate
bro u lost get a grip of urself honestly a youtuber bet u in a fight and u cant take it  grow up
i knew tommy would win good one g
It was a hugging match not boxing… no footwork, no jab nothing
Bro u lost
He deserves that money , from both of em 🎉
what a shit fight can't believe people buy tickets and support this crap
I like Ksi BUT i definitely see some HugSI
I need to see ksi vs mike tyson lol
KSI running around giving hugs to Tummy back to back then gets mad for losing. You deserve your win Tummy
KSI doesn’t know how to use his left hand lmao
ROBBBBBBBERRRRYYYY
I don't understand why they hold so much.
You lost G
Everyone saying JJ was clinching the whole fight but they were both doing that 😂
Ksi trying to be Michael venom page 😂😂😂
Ksi wasn’t impressing the judges at all by just clinching I don’t know how people think he won
Tommy needs to forget about boxing anyone bar proper boxers as this is just a clown of a fight ksi dancing around like he's in a nightclub. This makes Tommy look worse than he actually is because he's fighting non boxers which just make it look scrappy and circus like. Tommy stick to fighting pro boxers. Keep up the great work
Look at ksi hands aint up no blocking at all like he was just dancing in the ring 😂
Tommy held to much for a “real boxer”  Ksi was holding a lot too but furry engaged a lot of those hugs
What a sad fight to watch
Well done mate good fight  you need to attack with more aggression
🤣🤣 was more cuddling going on than fighting Jesus fucking christ
I was rooting for Tommy. Ksi has no technicality when it comes to real fight. There was no set ups, no angles, just punch ang go, stop punch and go
people have to realize when tommy always when to throw and landed, ksi just clinched.... which shows he literally doesnt want to box... judges saw it
tommy didnt get robbed, he legit didnt, he kept pressing forward, and ksi just wanted to clinch, i only saw like 3 power punches landed from ksi, constantly going into a clinch loses you points, it interupted tommy's boxing pace and style, its easy to judge on the sidelines, but tommy won fair and square
Wtf was ksi doing, he looks like a idiot😂
So who's the useless dancer in the grass skirt?
That was pathetic.
Legends say KSI is still jumping
Fury all day
posting the fight because Dazn wont for some reason hahahaha! nice one. congrats on the win
awful camera work
So satisfying to see KSI’s ego deflate like that. Back to YouTube bum, laugh all you want now!
KSI fight strategy: Back up, throw wild haymaker into a clinch, wait until ref separates the two, repeat
Seen better fights in P COMPANY milling.
Why was tommy punching at back of the head and grabbing him ?
i believe ksi also lost cause too much clinching showing he didnt want to engage
Even Jake was better
KSI flapping like a bird 🦅
That reff straight up got all mad and SLAPPED Tommy's arm at 9:27. Wtf?
Ksi just bad
Finding it very hard to call this ‘boxing’
Bro every fugging time tommy tries to punch KSI just huggs him like bro stop fighting lets hug each other
This is not good for boxing
These influencer guys are all huggers.
Tommy mate you are a legend 👏
Sorry KSI you really lost! Congratulations to Tommy it was a fair win 🥇
Trận đấu tâm điểm lại không hot bằng trận xấu hổ của danis
Don’t listen to the KSI cultists. You won that fight fair and square.
is this ksi’s coming out as a bit fruity all he did he was hug tommy all match…
This is phisically hard to watch honestly
If anyone got robbed, it was the fans who paid for this 💩
A win is a win fuck what people think .🖕💯🖕 Canada supports the FURY FAMILY 💯 Now get back to fighting real boxers and build your record or at least make sure the bag is bigger Canada will be watching 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
How do people like ksi won? he had no boxing skill he bouncing around like is mortal combat, he would be better suited for mma
easy win for Tommy
Why the fk does he keep clinching respect to Tommy for humbling this Logan Paul cack bloody sackkr
😂😂😂😂 commentators really talking like theres a fight going on 😂😂😂 thank god i only pay to watch this fights  if they arent youtubers
Why everyone acting like KSI was the only one initiating the clinch? Looked pretty even from this video that both him and Tommy Fury kept initiating the clinch pretty evenly
87 times in the full fight ksi was just holding on, what a joke
Somebody tell KSI to out hus hands up 💀
Fight Vidal Riley
My boi ksi thought he won by flapping his arms like flappy bird the whole time 😭
I mean... JJ works so damn hard and then when the adrenaline kicks in he does this shit... No combinations, heymakers, jumping around for no reason, same sh*t over and over again. You're not meant to be a pro boxer... just deal with it, man. Youtube boxing is nowhere near professional boxing. Jake's technique is still way better than JJs. And for Tommy Fury... I'm disappointed.
KSI GOT ROBBED, Tommy doesn’t deserve the win
Lol he’s so jealous of Tommy
Ksi can not fight he can do one thing good which is avoiding to throw a punch 😂
Tommy fury lost😅
Ksi should have been penalised for clinching so many times, at this point it could have been refusing to engage, the kid is a pussyhole who can't take a punch
Ksi fans are furious
so KSI had one plan...land the haymaker rofl. I mean come on...Haymaker or hug was his plan.
ksi should of won
So boring dude, KSI didn't box, just grabbing him... obviously Tommy is the winner
It's funny how you think you won😂😂😂 how pathetic
Ksi has NO idea how to step & walk a ring… he Thinks it’s just jumping around like a ballerina
KSI was fighting the way MVP fought against Perry in their bare knuckle fight. Dart in, jab, back off, hug, back off, dart in, jab, back off, hug, repeat.
Why is he just doing star jumps? Completely different leagues, dont lower yourself to this Tommy
Shudve took a point for clinching goo much
It should of been a draw with the -1
People paid to watch them cuddle
Thank you Tommy you won fair and square
6 rounds of star jumps and a lot of huggs
All I've learned about Tommy Fury is that he can't knock out youtubers lmao
he love to hug
tommy fury won fair and square, ksi missed a lot of overhands, tommy kept pressing forward, people that say ksi won dont understand boxing, tommy countered a lot as well and punished ksi for missing, also tommy landed cleaner shots
KSI’s one of the biggest wastemen going
its a shame that they call you a pro boxer
Ksi. Hugging,running, windmilling. Horrible “boxer”
Good job, tommy. Thanks for shutting ksi up. He is a terrible boxer just swinging constantly. Love from 🇨🇦
KSI training same gym with MVP trying to fight like him but he can't pull it off
Ironic you left the best shot of the fight out in this video 😂🤣
I think all KSI really needed was a hug, it seems to be the only thing he goes for, instant hugging
Pro boxer a joke
Please someone count and tally and make a video compilation of the amount of times ksi hugged Tommy. Every single fking time ksi got hit he clinched onto Tommy. Gone are the days of real boxing.. any of the greats from the 80s would've knocked ksi out in the first few round. No hugging just punching the shit out of that YouTube weirdo.
Tommy fury my dad met you at the petrol station a few months ago, you was in the black top and with your gf!! U had a picture with him
You are a bad example in the Fury family
This fight was the worst on the card icl (Tommy had the best walk out tho)
one hand "clinching" and ripping the body with your other hand is illegal you cant grab an opponent and hit him
Menudas bailarinas ,parece un baile de taekwondo
More hugging than an episode of Eastenders 😅😂
Ksi just hugging 🤦‍♂️ congrats. Tommy
Tommy got owned😂
Get in their Tommy proved em wrong
In other words....hes shit as a pro boxer
as soon as fury lands ksi is clinching for dear life lol
To be honest....i thought Tommy did just enough to win but should have knocked KSI out....as a pro boxer....these people shouldn't b a problem yet they show that he as good as he should be....FACT
Millions of dollars for 18 minutes make it make sense these guys shoulda went ten atleast no fight should be six rounds bloody joke
Jus call it a no contest and have a rematch with no hugging and make it 8 round
I will never get that time back. Ksi is shit!
Tommy, don't fight anymore of these publicity YouTube style fights. You need to up the game and your opponents, especially if you want want to work your way up the ladder.
Ur so bad Ngl
It reminds me of when you fight a Grab Spammer on XenoVerse.
Ksi just clinched for dese life the entire fight
KSI is and will always be an embarrassment. Fury took the win 100% and to think otherwise is a criminal offence
I guess ksi feels he won because he kept hitting tommy in the body and face repeatedly when he would clench
worst fight i've ever seen, too much hugging, did either actually land a good punch,?
Horrible what has boxing become today. Nothing but dancing and grabbing and hugging
Huging contest
If you dnt want punched in the back of the head quit clinching the whole round through because your afraid to get hit
He would probably be better if he use punches as much as he used rest of his body
He really practiced his star jumps during camp.
Man i wanted ksi to win but when i saw that he is the same shit fughter that literally got better at the same mistakes hahaha...clinching head down and same movements on reoeat (same duck time after time ) and just hugs and hugs...yeah ksi have a fight with jake paul and call your boxing days over
I hope the fight w Logan happens, congrats Tommy
Rubbish glad I didn't pay to watch  that crap
£6m for star jumping around a ring and hugging?? How do I sign up?😂
Well done tommy well deserved 💙
Wat the fuk have I just watched, two armatures I might take up boxing
Its hard to watch ksi clinching and crying the whole fight doing half jumping jacks. Thats not boxing
1. CLINCHING 2. Making his head stick to Tommy’s head (so that he wouldnt get punched his head and got KO)  3. Use his left arm to lock/block Tommy’s stronger right arm (easy cause KSI is shorter) 4. Keep punching Tommy’s left lung  5. Repeat x 1000000  LMAO IS THIS BOXING?
Ksi should quit boxing join dance class
KSI did the same exact thing 60 times coming in and Fury didn't manage to time a counter for that ? This is not boxing, it's bull$hit.
Ya ksi is the one that kept grabbing an laying his head on Tommy’s shoulder
Embarrassing ksi just didn't want to fight
Goofy ass fight
Ksi needs to switch to Muay Thai, first the elbows now he’s clinching.
KSI WHAT THE F IS THIS AHAHAHAHAHAHAAAHHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA what a clown
Guys there isn’t a single way ksi won that fight, all he did was dance back and fourth and throw an overhand and when that didn’t work that weasel ran for that clinch and held on for dear life
Ksi won you pay for a referee
Well in Tommy deserved 👏
Can’t believe people think ksi actually won that fight with one good round lmao kids
KSI was terrible.. clinch every 3sec.
What a load of sh!t both are sh!t though Tommy thinks he is a professional boxer 😂😂😂
Imagine rooting for KFC lol this guy a legit bum
Why were they hugging each other. Is that allowed?
Tommy lost ...
KSI is just a kid for pro boxer because of this kangaroo fight style his endurance will be technically drain 😂😂 poor fellow
Both of them are trash they would never beat a guy like gervonta davis.
2:05  *I demand -1 point! And also demand you drink PRIME*   _The fourtyFourthhead hath spoken_  👽
You lost tommy
Ksi claims to be a boxer.. 5 seconds later "but ref he hit me"!?
Bro ksi goes for clinch in every engagement 😂😂
KSI looks so embarrassing
ksi is such a dirty fighter
Bias judges... They don't like the fact Youtubers are entering the ring.
KSI is a terrible boxer wow. I thought he was better than that. I guess he can’t throw punches at someone he’s scared of.
he's complaining about being punched in the back of the head hahahaha. him what happened your last fight with your opponent?
If this was a hugging competition ksi would dominate and if this was hitting in the back of the head Tommy would dominate
I hope you know you ain’t win that fight 😂
Between 1:40 and 1:46..  KSI *CLEARLY PUNCHES TOMMY FURY IN BACK OF HEAD* 😂😂 1:48 KSI  *_complaining about being Hit in the back of head_*   Maybe stop jumping around like Kid buu and Predator spliced their genes and asked Rihana for an egg to lab grow you and you wouldn’t be getting donkey punched   *Without Logan behind ya*   Lol Nah, I don’t have anything against KSI.. I just hate L.Paul enough to dislike him.,   😂 jp  😆🤣
3 mins in and Ksi can’t even keep his hands up
Maybe ksi thought they would fight mma 😂
This is sad & for people to think this is actual fighting on KSI’s part are just fans of his & doesn’t care about the sport.
Horrible fight
Ksi was boxing?  He was acting like that new dude in the training whos about to spar and afraid to take a punch in the face
Fury wilder 4 😂
Tommy: ik I'm bad but I want to win Ksi: can I have a hug pls
Listening to the commentators talk like ksi was winning was a little worrying 😂
KSI is an unorthodox clincher NOT an unorthodox boxer.
You should have lost mate
Ksi remind me of Floyd my weather 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
RIP to anyone who paid for this event 😅
Someone show KSI this video 😂 saying Tommy didn't land...erm..yeah he did
This was such a bad fight but nah Tommy would fair and square lmao
thanking your fans for what? you lost
Absolutely love all of these comments appreciating the obvious skill difference between an actual boxer and a one trick pony
most boring fight ive ever had the pleasure of not paying for to watch
Tommy has to be smart enough and tough enough to figure this idiot out
what is this
2:11 bro dapped up the ref 💀💀
I HATE WHEN REFS TAKE WHOLE DAY TO BREAK THEM FROM CLINCH.. kinda ruined the fight Congrats to Tommy
KSI's whole game plan was to throw over reaching punches, luck and going for the clinch the moment one of his attempted punches didn't land 🤣 Tommy isn't the greatest boxer in the world but let's face is KSI lost
Robbed ksi was robbed.
lol Ksi looks goofy he sucks at boxing
aww ksi jus wan a hug from yu lol
What a lousy fight. This permanent clinging of KSI just shows that he is a bot. He is just able to make a single punch and then he has to clinch so that he doesn't get his face smashed in for his lacking and incompetent defense. Sad that he gets paid for it too.
but ksi the goat tho
garbage fight
It was dirty that he kept hitting ksi in the back of the head but tommy still definitely won the fight, ksi was just being retarded with those jumping Jack's instead of keeping his guard. He got too cocky.
Awwwww they're cuddling
I think ksi needs to go and read a book on how to box worse thing he has ever done is get involved with the paul brothers cause they blown his ego way to high and he now thinks he can do anything go back to what you know and like before its to late
Ksi is just jumping around 😂😂😂
Your a good bloke Tommy! However, I think a draw would have been a better decision:-)
Star jump champion 🌟
Hugging each other the whole fight
ksi has no guard and runs in trys to superman punch and cuddle he can't fight its a joke that he even saying he got robbed
If KSI had real boxers as training partners, and not just yes-men, that karate bladed stance would've been gone when he was still a beginner.
Ksi is jocking Micheal Venom Page fighting style
ksi is a terrible boxer
There's a difference between a fighter and a boxer and Tommy is not a fighter
KSI came to cuddle and jump a bit
Ksi fighting is awful , all he did is hugging. What a embarrassing match for him , he fighting like nyc junkies
0:25 KSI forced a clinch 0:52 KSI forced a clinch 1:21 KSI forced a clinch 1:40 KSI forced a clinch  and then it just goes one like this  """"BUT TOMMY CLINCHED THE ENTIRE MATCH""""  tommy proved he isn´t a pro boxer and KSI proved he didn´t come to fight , he came to barely win by points by giving the people the most boring wrestling match ever recorded
CANT FIGHT!!! 😢😢😢 STICK TO THE WEB FOO...
Shouldn’t u be knocking YouTubers out!? Very embarrassing, but u got paid. Bit of a disgrace to your family name tho
Ksi clearly has no intention of boxing, he’s avoiding, and then getting in close only to cling on Tommy like wth
Ksi made the match look disgusting to watch.
You lost
W Tommy
You lost Tommy KSI got robbed
KSI never covered his face, probably the worst defence ever. Jumping left and right
Desvered win. Ksi got exposed
This whole event is a L
Wtf is Ksi doing? It looks like he doing one of those dance workout exercise videos 🫢
Ksi won but it is what it is. If ksi clinched less and threw more he woulda been a clear victor. But the score cards are insane regardless 58-56 even with a point deduction. Tommy did not dominate and even his father was shocked about the score card.
Glad i want sleep ksi has shown how shite he is
If i was tommy fury and had his career i would MMA KSI for the disrespect. But yk nowadays boxing is full of littlw girls
What a absolute embarrassing display of boxing.. that black fella was a looked more like a clown dancing around and jumping in the clinch.. never gave the other lad the chance to display what looked like some pretty decent boxing ability.. british boxing is failing
❤❤❤
I guess KSI ain’t in his Prime 😅
For all the ones who think ksi didint won ill humble yall rn 1,2,3 was clearly ksis rounds if u cant admit just stfu and then they took away the point from tommy for back of the head shots so there is no way in hell that tommy won tommy ur a clown boxer ? Shut up been boxing since age of 9 and lost to a youtuber embarrassing
KS CRY
Used to take my boy boxing when he was 10 he could perform better than this shit show . lol
You shouldve beat him around the ring like a ragdoll if you did half of what you did against Jake you wouldve knocked him TF out
Ksi has mastered the clinch 😂
Does ksi think he's Bruce Lee 😂
Ksi is such a horrible boxer
Ksi wanted a hug fest 😂
Sorry people let us comeback to reality.. Tommy is a professional fighter...he is giving no pressure..view seconds full speed and good night KSI...let youtuber against each other to fight...a lot of money for a bit show😂😊
All that smack talk from KSI, he is overrated af. That jumping jack stance that he does in the ring while hoping to land a wild swing like a baby throwing a tantrum is just fcking awful 😂
No worries tommy you legend bro said I said you'd won and you won plus the jake paul and ksi fight you got point took off them fights and you still won there bums made for YouTube ksi I don't even know why he's famous he's a weirdo if you ask me he don't know nothing about boxing
Tommy L Ksi W
I paid to see two people cuddle, for 18 minutes robbery
What a dead match. All i saw was hugging. These kinda matches are boring. Why do they do this and not go for the knockout. People actually pay to watch this nonsense
the video was weird... why is it 2 times the same video back to back in one video^ x)
This was painfuly boring to watch..
These kind fights always sucks and it started with stupid may weather vs Logan Paul only one I actually would probably take seriously is Jake but Logan and KSI are both clowns 🤡
Damn ksi was just hugging man
JJ kept dancing like a dragonfly you deserve it
amount of hugs by jj….
KSIs weird style saved his ass tbh, I think Tommy has the capability to knock all these aholes out if he stops underestimating them. he is clearly much better but ksi clinching like a rat and jumping around like my chihuahua when I come home was just fkin weird...
ksi has a big ass forhead i couldant even tell where his head was
Is this what KSI calls boxing? I need some gd damn answers y'all
We all saw Tommy was going to win but can I say this was one of the worst boxing fights we have seen
The worst boxing match i ever saw :))) What is that KSI puppet doing all the time hugging if you don't know how to fight why do you think you can :)))
“my whole life ive been a boxer” struggled with a youtuber and didnt even get close to one knockout moment. he barely won and if not it was a draw at most they both suck and tommy thinks he can move away from entertainment fights these have been his toughest fight lmao hes ass 😂( idc if he was holding ive seen professional easily deal with these types of fighters it supposed to be “light work “ and he didnt nothing impressive and yall are dik riding him like hes a goat😂
Bro it honestly feels like I watched the same round line 5 times
It’s embarrassing KSI didn’t show up to put on a show he came to increase his bank account because that wasn’t boxing.
they are both funny.. they are not for boxing.. skill 0.. better they go outside to have fight like normal ppl than making themselves fools inside that boxing ring
ksi haters are funniest people going haha. i didnt care who won but tommy initiated most of the clinches and lost the fight
Jj has no defense bruh. Why are his arms down like that? The only defense he had was ducking down and then hugging wtf
Ksi did nothing but holding and illegal punching
What happen to the score cards then. The back of heads punches. You couldn’t handle the style. Ksi even said he’s going to fight you not box you. If Tommy was such a good professional boxer why didn’t he dominate the ring.
KSI won
If this was 8 rounds we would have had a far more clear understanding of who won 6 rounds is just too short, did Tommy underperform? He did for sure but ksi was not boxing like a normal person he was like a wild horse that needs to be tamed  You guys should’ve done 8 rounds tbh every round finishes so quick and the whole time it’s just hugging feel bad for any1 who spent money on this lmao  but all the best congrats to Tommy
Absolute prat.. Just holding every second and jumping on the spot..... Shambles to be called boxing.
Ksi just wanted a hug
Fury is no boxer
Jj was terrible!!!!!!! Bro don't even call that boxing
DANZ commentators very biased, KSI could be punching air all night and yet the commentators will claim he’s landing amazing shots 😂🤦‍♂️ also the referee was useless 😮
This sport is nothing like I was in the 80s 90s
People think clinching is any activity in fighting I swear the fans are so stupid sometimes especially when they’ve never fought themselves or done anything like that 😂 KSI lost he didn’t wanna engage, he punched sloppy, terrible form, tommy was just waiting for him😂 closing off the ring, wait for him to decide when he wants to fight, CONGRATS TOMMY!!!🎉
How tommy won this still blows my mind
Tbh we all knew who was gonna win
This is what happens when you put YouTube head to head with real boxers. Glad I didn't buy this shit of a ppv. Feel sorry for all those that went in person.
Why is Ksi holding so damn much and started hitting tommy in he back of the ear when it happens to him he bitches about it but consider how they both fighting I see why tommy come out with the victory
12:38 JJ tryna go for the elbow again 💀
A embarrassment for boxing!!!
KSI is a str8 up PUFF
GOOD LAD TOMMY SMASHED HIM
💯
Why KSI clinching at every humanely possible moment? Why box you’re just gonna clinch when engaged?
Tommy faught dirty. Punching him the the back of the head MULTIPLE times after being told to stop. Hitting him after the bell duscusting he is NO fury!.
What a shit show of boxing the fury’s and the YouTubers making a laughingstock out of boxing
What a joke to be called a Fury 😅
What is ksi flipping about at
Ksi is a cringe fighter who kept hugging and trying to smother Tommy after every punch he threw and then has the narcissistic audacity to think he won like gtfo
KSI the clincher....and im a ksi video warcher hahah ..and i wanted him to win
1:50 ridiculous acting
KSI is so trash wtf...
People pay to Watch this horseshit?!?!
Punch, clinch, star jump
I ain’t hearing shit Tommy is the better boxer he should’ve won by KO but therefore it proves KSI is better than Jake KSI style was affective and Tommy didn’t like it so stay mad ksi won that
Well done tommy you also got to 100k subs
Bro you didn't win this fight and you know it. No way any pure boxing fan thinks KSI lost. You cant be regarded as the professional boxer and not land significant shots, not know how to apply pressure effectively, not know how to cut the ring and not know how to fight on the inside. KSI was too fast and dodgy for you. If you are a pro boxer, my grandma can run 22 mph 😂. "Clinching" is part of the sport used to any fighters advantage especially when you know your opponent has power but slow (Tommy Fury) to get his shots off. Those judges should've scored it a draw at best. Run it back and clear your name
Jj fights like dog ass no hate on him he a good content creator but hen it comes to boxing he needs to stay 1 a light year away from it
A load of shit
Ksi trash af smh lamb ass fight
He's fighting a clown 🤡
yeah this is bad fighting sorry not blaming tommy ksi was playing
did ksi think he was a bird learning to fly ffs
People really pay to see this nonsense smh
Both fighters was ass KSI  was clenching, but fairy was welcoming every clinch every punchy through. He was closing the distance so much he have nothing to do but clutch. all of that could’ve been avoided of both fighters knew how to keep distance.
KSI don't know how to box..
Ksi has a big head😂
Need to stop these wwf fights, pathetic, YouTubers need to stay out the ring, Kai is an embarrassment the way he’s carrying on,
Can these guys stop making out and start fighting
Is this supposed to be hugging bout?
KSI hugs more than a Barney the purple dinosaur Saturday afternoon special. He's the worst boxer I've seen in decades.
I dont understand how hugging and punching for this long is entertainment
#team fury’s 🥊
Monkey ain't doing shit to myke Tyson 💀
Absolute bollox ksi looked like a space invader hopping around the ring
Everyone thinking ksi was the one hugging. Ksi landed more significant shots snd rocked tommy 3 or 4 times and tommy hit JJ in the back of the head 8 times and only got a point deducted for 1. Refs were biased. Im not a massive fan of either guys but any boxing purist would know that accuracy and punches landed wins fights whether clinching or not
Tommy you lost that fight bro
This is shit more hugs than fighting 😂
Tommy keep your head held high mate he was awkward didnt wanna exchange and held you everytime a punch was thrown .good look going forward if another youtube fight comes up TAKE it and earn money for your family mate ❤
What a sh1t fight
What a shite ref. Ksi had his left arm wrapped around tommys waist for the majority kf the fight. Shoulda had a few points deducted
So happy for you Tommy don’t let anyone say u did not win u did god bless u and your family
Ksi fighting like a women😂😂😂
hugging match. no clean boxing ... too baddddd
WSI!!!
Ksi boxes like such an idiot you guys have been boxing for this long and still can’t put on a good show hang it up please and Tommy can stop pretending like dude you’re punching him in the back of the end don’t act surprised
Ksi is a clown
Kangaroo clinching got him nowhere 🤣😂
U lost
This YouTube boxing needs to stop, I’d be upset if I paid my money to see this joke👎🏾
boxing really needs to do something to reduce the endless clinching you get in some fights.  don't mind when it's a tactic early on to tire an opponent but when it's guys just winding up, missing, and ending up clinching repeatedly it's super frustrating to watch
Yoo when ksi faked that head injury 😂😂😂
Tommy won the boxing match ksi won the wrestling match
This is a joke that tommy wins i menq like ksi throw a lot more punches that was efektiv kai was much better and tommy was hitting ksi so many times behind the had soo this is ajoke tommy by the referi
Shouldn’t have been a challenge for the pro. But negroes are a magical peculiar people.
Spent his time either hugging him or flying away from him aha ! Shite
You 100% lost but we move
Wins a win but honestly neither one of you guys were looking great out there.    This looked like an amateur fight all around.    Wins a win though
I honestly got frustrated by this fight, KSI hugging session is vomiting
I am a KSI fan and i have to admit Tommy won fair and square
Tommy now you know why KSI only wanted 6 rounds. Imagine what u would of done it 8/10 rounds. Well done
most boring fight i ever seen
Ksi def won like Tommy’s leaning on him the whole fight cuz he’s gassed Ksi did better then Jake for sure good fight boys but Ksi won for sure he lit him up and tommy kept hitting the back of his head
KSI looks like he trynna mate
This is hard to watch one boxer and one wrestler cuz it's pure hugging
KSI IS GOAT
Damn my nigga Kai can’t box for shit put them mf hands up 🙌🏿
So ksi had to use the mayweather style cuz he was afraid to box... Shame
From this view you can tell it was a close fight but not a robbery
Tommy need to stop throwing left hucks uppercut left over hand right
This fight was ass wtf is Ksi doing flopping around with his guard down THE WHOLE FIGHT you look goofy man, you wanna box professionally..start taking yourself serious cause you definitely made a fool of yourself 💯
Still lost
Ksi shouldn't be allowed to box again after that performance
This mofo KSI doing jumping jacks the whole dam fight and expects to win. 🤣🤣🤣
Ref there to protect ksi
I can't even watch this. Looks like he's jumping rope, handscall down. Disgrace. What a wus.
Hug contest
Someone should have gotten these two bitches a blanket all the damn cuddling that was going on😂😂😂
To much holding Ksi is low key scared 😱 😂
Tommy won, ksi just kept clinching and grabbing after he got hit once. Fury and Logan were clear cut winners
Imagine that there are people who payed to watch this 😂😂😂
Shoot! Stop hugging every encounter. You deserve your lose bro when you keep hugging.
Ksi is a top ranked hugger haha...lost count how many times he went for the clinch 😂....and Tommy need to watch and observe his opponent more for patterns on there defence...how many times ksi slipped to the right to dodge the jabs And Tom was still throwing left hooks what resulted to all the hugging.when in my opinion all he had to do is set up a faint with the jab to make ksi come faward step back and throw a straight cross to jaw and it would of been done and even if it didn't work it would of been better to see that than clinches and rabbit punches.
Worst fight i ever seen
Ksi got robbed
why dont you show round 6 buddy hmm 🤔
This is just fucking sad😢
This was not a boxing fight, this was hugging your opponent
Did 20k people seriously pay money to go watch this ?
Ksi fights like he's missing some chromosomes 😂
KSI cant fight a lick dam lol. Terrible.
I watched this whole fight pressing the arrow key and it skips 5 seconds...well every 5 seconds that i skipped they were in ANOTHER clinch XD. Give it a try, you'd be surprised to see how often KSI does this ahaha
1:48 this foo acting up after a padded glove hit his cheek and he threw a WHOLE ASS ELBOW !
well deserved mate even tho I wanted JJ to prevail in this duel.
The dude KSI shouldn’t be allowed to box . He makes the sport look horrible. Hug fest 🫂
How some people see boxing 🥊 box ,don't run ,hit don't swing,Tommy fury won,he was up early from his corner and when broken by the ref Tommy was always pushing to get bat in there, ok credit for ksi, for promotions,,outstanding job, but please can we all take a moment and go watch boxing matches from the past, I've never seen anyone box  like ksi,,great kid done amazing whit his youtube, but boxing yeh with other youtube people,,,,in out in out like a kooko clock, would have won if it was a dancing contest ❤😂😂😂
I’m never watching one of these YouTubers fight again lol Tommy get on with your career those social media duds let them fight them selves lol
Blind mfs watch tommy in the clenches not ksi , see whos initiating them
You done us proud well don.. Gipsy kings.. TNT 4 life...
As a KSI supporter, fair play Tommy. You won that or at least drew. KSI didn't win. He and so many others are being sore losers. They're casuals. I was screaming at KSI for the amount of jumping and clinching he was doing. You wanted to engage. You won.
I fuck with Tommy. He seems pretty humble unlike these cunt youtubers. GG’s
love it tommy well in lad
What a frustrating fighter that K is! Rush in and grab! Rush in and grab! Also he hit Tommy on the back of the head enough times then whinged when he got one back! I wish Tom could have controlled the distance more with his jab as when he had K at the right distance Tommy was the much better boxer! I think Tommy is rightly growing on the people. Keep it up man. Well done Tommy!!!
KSI style only works if your opponent backs up. He had no plan for tommy moving forward.   Like a simple side step would have stopped them from hugging 😂
Imo its a draw at best for tommy never de he win
seems like a draw to me, they both clinched too much
Star jump x4 then the right overhead, then hug.. repeat. This wasn't boxing - this was shite from Ksi
The fight was borin asf thank god i didn't waste my money on this
Jake vs KSI BIG FIGHT PPV needs to happen. If Jake Paul hits KSI his going down just like his older brother logan knocked KSI down. And Jake paul hits harder than Tommy too no wonder he rocked Tommys head back.
Right Overhand,run,hug is all ksi  knows how to do
KSI hit in the back of the head 10x more than Tommy. Then cities when he's hit in the back of the head.   The ref was blind or biased. The same round Tommy got the point deducted, Ksi should have too
Ksi won
If You Think KSI Was Robbed, You Definitely Don’t Need To Be Watching Boxing  KSI Style Is Jumping Jacks & Bear Hugging.
Wakey wine and TOMMY next 😅
This fight should never have happened. Fights like these put boxing to shame!   A BOXER VS A STAR JUMPER!!!  Modern boxing has gone down the drain. Tommy Fury doesn't deserve to fight jokers like him. You shouldn't have taken this fight, as it wasn't entertaining and didn't bring out the best in you.
KSI made a good banchbag 😅😅😅
the worst fight ever bro hugged the whole 6 rounds
it's hard to box someone that dosen't want to box.
Tommy should have let big John fight that fight. Easy win for both.
Fight be like: 🫂
Plus 22 times he warned you not to do something and no points taken of them. Like this is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000% ridged
Fake ass event
Ksi the clench master. What a punk. Good job shutting that ass clown down.
Maybe KSI should have left his dress at home 😅😅😅 he is a dancing queen 👸 😅
Congratulations U should never rematch ksi, U look tired with hus bullshit. Jake was professionall
Ksi and boxing just don't go he's fucking abysmal
How the fuck can Tommy be a pro boxing when he on the same level as YouTubers…… what over pro boxer even entertain a YouTubers 😭🤣  watching it look like Ksi won
ksi is one punch hugging one punch hugging .
Yeah this view point it’s clear KSI was doing the same over hand right clinch and hug.
Who did you pay off Tommy? Tell us make it easier for you
Fight him again one day
Can we stop having youtubers make a joke out of professional boxing by doing jumping jacks and swinging around awkwardly?
A lot of clinching in the fight. KSI was strong in the first half but after a while he dwindled. He did well overall considering his experience. Good fight!
Clinching is not entertaining
I think the judges didn't want ksi to win and The boxning community to look bad becas a "Youtube boxer" was gonna win so one of the judges did put a extra point to tommy or did remove a point for ksi so tommy woud win, becas else the boxning community would be looked at like a diskrace.
Clinch for days
Clinch much
Ksi fought like some crack head in the street 😂😂 waving his arms up and down  jumping around missing huge swings lmfao
Huggy Fury and HugSI
Ksi needa to go to the mma with all this grappling
You didn’t win that😂 absolute robbery
both cant box
At first I wasn’t a fan of KSI, but after his humble approach in defeat I am now. His true character of humility and sportsmanship really shined through. I’m inspired, KSI you have a new fan brother
Tommy is class . Congratulations well deserved win
When tommy try hit after 1 hit straight away clinch this fucking clown ksi! Wtf he on it jumping and clitching the whole match!
So hopping around while waving your arms in the air like an angry crab is how you box now?
there was no way tommy could of had a proper fight woth this clown he wasnt fighting
Glad I didn't pay to watch that load of shit
whole fight was a clinch fest
Ksi got robbed
WELL DONE
Turn away from the punches and get hit in the back of the head, simple. Tommy committed to the punches and if someone turns away or turns their back then of course you’re gonna hit them in the back of the head. This fight was just awful. Fuck knows what the star jump tactic was all about 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
The whole fight: 😡🫂😡
Ksi was embarrassing. If he just wanted a hug he should have just asked
Tommy won fair and square...  The only thing KSI won is the Misfit hugging championship of the universe.. ksi fight card hand picked the ref and judges and still lost lol  #fyp #viral #boxing #misfitsboxing #ksi #tommyfury #fury #tysonfury #notrigged #misfits #notRobbed
Interesting fight.... would have been nice to see some jabs though 🤷‍♂️
Couldnt take the smoke. And tommy at the end saying youtube bum. Perfect reality check for these youtubers.
That dude, called KSI, should start dancing, or break-dancing, he is trying to fly or i don't know, he likes to hug someone, that's for sure, being famous on youtube, doesn't make you a better sportsman, in this case, boxer... Fury won with 1 point deduction, remember that!
I find it funny/ironic that KSI cries about a loss and begs for an appeal after making sure to choose which judges HE wanted on HIS event… 😂
Useless fighters I have ever seen in my life
🤡🌍
That was the most disappointing fight I tough you were better like what I think ksi actually won
KSI NUST BE IN LOVE WITH MVP CUZ THATS EXACTLY HOW MVP FIGHTS JUMPING JACKS INTO RIGHT HAND... BUT MVP DOESNT HUG KSI WAS SCARED OF TOMMY HE HUGGED HIM SO HE COULDNT GET BEAT UP.. KSI SUCKS THE PPL THEY PAOD FOR THESE FIGHTS SHOULD GET THEIR MONEY BACK BUT THEY ARE STUPID TOO
Well fought Tommy , Jake was more professional
Ksi losing this fight was the best feeling. So happy Tommy shut this man up. Mf was crying at the end of this fight at his own event. Time for Ksi to stop ducking Jake Paul and fight him 😂
Yall glazing tommy so hard it was a robbery if you don’t agree then don’t reply
Ksi has the disadvantage of having  that massive dome as an easy target.
tommy was the actual one clinching. pussy fury.
Jj won
Now I know why KSI wears that Bandana!! 🤣😂 #SlapHead
KSI lolol what a shmuck
Bro whoever payed for this ppv or especially got tickets learned a fucking lesson. This has to be the last of these yt boxers making fools of themselves. Like when the build up is better then the fight you might as well be watching wwe
You Morons. Jj won simple as that. Justifying fury’s shit win because of clinching. If he didn’t want to clinch he won’t have held on as well, they were both working on the inside an if fury was the better boxer he won’t of allowed him inside every time.   Ksi was robbed an it’s such a shame how corrupt the sport is. Been happening for ages, glovkin canelo is a prime example.   Robbed robbed robbed
KSI would be a better wrestler
Ksi is a real p@say for milking those punches to the “back” of his head  what a big baby
Most boring fight I’ve seen in my life… 6 rounds of clinching wow
For some one who’s been training their entire life Tommy is shit, needs to give it up
I can't watch any more   People really paid to watch KSI give out this many free hugs 😂
You’ve had wayy more experience and u put a show on like tht against a YOUTUBER when your supposed to be the professional pro boxer who’s never lost and this is how u fight u should be ashamed of urself yes I am using the word ashamed cos I am rightly using tht word absolutely disgusting
Jj got heart 💪
KSI WON PROVE ME WRONG KSI WON
Ksi thinking he can do ballet in a boxing ring!
This is cringe they cant fight just cuddle
Y’all forgot the point. Ksi, a YouTuber, just went toe to toe with a pro boxer 🏆
Tommy didn't deserve that win. What a joke.
Been fighting since u were 16 when ksi was 16 he was in his room making fifa videos
Good too see comments are actually right... Ksi never got robbed. He landed about 2.5 decent punches but 100 or more excellent cuddles. If the fight was judged on who    looked the best "boxer" than yes it was Tommy Fury and it would of become even more evident with extra rounds.
I hope to see the day someone puts one of these youtubers down for nap and ends this nonsense
#KSIREPELL
KSI was just hugging
Nah KSI hugged Tommy more in this fight than he ever did with his dad
You hit I’m in the back of the head 7 times and only got one point taken off, your a robber, you don’t deserve it.
They should have just left them wrestle, cuz i don't think they wanted to box.
Its just a joke..so glad I didnt pay for.it😂😂😂 disgrace for boxing
Jake also has way more energy and throws harder punches and just goes and goes. But you did well against him but against Ksi and getting the point deducted it’s just pity.
It looks like KSI thinks he’s prince Naseem Hamed, but without the skill 😂
Tommy you can never be like your brother NEVER!
I would be so pissed if I was Tommy watching some one hug every time you’ve thrown a punch 😬🤣
Didn’t win bud
Ksi is embarrassing
Wtf is going on? Aren't u supposed to put your hands up? Not this clown ksi flail around like you're mentally handicapped and clinch immediately... not a great technique 😅 and why is tommy still fighting YouTubers?
bro fuck what ksi fans are saying if you watch the fight back ignoring the bias commentary there’s an argument you want every round other than the second
Bro KSI lost that, mf was just dancing around and hugging after attempting to punch. Tommy controlled the fight and ended rounds nicely. To pro judges, tommy did enough to edge the win. It was close though. I would’ve also understood a draw but I’m not surprised with the judges conclusion.
Nothing to be proud of smh... For that performance none of you should win or at best the one with less experience....
They both looked like you tube fighters and held on each other like lovers. Pathetic fight
Okay, I’m not even trying to be a hater but if you played like this against Jake he would have beat your ass in the first three rounds.
Would a load of shite I’ve never trained before and bet I’d put on a better show than that what a joke
Ksi definitely won the jumping jacks competition for sure
You lost
Ksi held tommy about 14 times in the fight not just clinching but holding him every time there was Going to be an initiate of attack and ppl are saying it's robbed
Embarrassing for every Tommy fan
Amen brother my respect went up for u at the end for thanking our lord and saviour Jesus Christ
Ksi complained about Logan Paul clenching too much then he does it with Tommy
Tommy jumping with joy after losing to a youtuber 😂
Not an entertaining fight at all not even a fight bunch of bear hugs is all it was
Fury is a professional boxer and can only do this v a youtuber?
I love watching KSI's video even I'm saying KSI took a huge L
If you made £4-5 million pound happy days anyway, would love 20 grand at the moment we’ll done
This fight is an embarrassment to the sport of boxing both looked like beginners 😂
KSI SHOLD OF WON
KSI was like a little girl in the park just jumping and swinging hands up and down.
Good job Tommy can’t wait for new fights to come
Thats was an awful fight. Both men hugging each other , few punches thrown, even fewer clean punches. KSI is not a good boxer but Tommy also looked awful.
Ksi game plan. Jump, throw telegraphed right hand, hug, and repeat
Scripted !! Pulling punches I can’t believe my eyes 👀
Well done champ !!!!
Go Tommy! I like JJ, he seems to be a nice person, but whenever he fights he is unlikeable. You were the more likable one in this bout, kudos to u. Congratulations on ur victory.
This fight is joke's man. Ykw both didn't do their job. Tommy didn't knock him out and KSI didn't even box, he just swinging his hand up and down. L match
Tommy Fury vs. KSI -   Punch Stats Statistic.                     	KSI   Tommy Total punches thrown	  124	   159 Total punches landed 	 38	      37 Power punches thrown	  74	    95 Power punches landed	  35	    27 Jabs thrown	                    50	    64 Jabs landed	                      3    	10 It is clear who is the winner
We should not allow millennials to fight in boxing anymore!
Why was Ksi clinching so much?? This was the only fight he has ever done this.
ksi got robbed he won round 1 2 mybe 3  and 6
Glad to see these two boys loved each other so much they hugged all night!!!!
Tell me one of the Fury’s filmed and uploaded this, just to piss off DAZN more 😂
I can’t believe people think KSI won. I also can’t believe they took a point from Fury. Meanwhile KSI was clinching excessively and didn’t lose a point. A lot of people don’t watch enough boxing. Fury won even with a annoying opponent and a point deduction. Running and clinching don’t get you a W.
Little daddies boy rigging fights cause he knew he couldn’t win.
Damn ksi is real good at hugging
KSI got robbed, lets not dick suck tommy fury..
It's this a boxing match or a hugging match. Both are shit
Wow what a boring fight... all insee is them doing the same thing over and over. Come in close, grab each other, then get split up... stand up and fight 😅
is this what boxing has come to, pfttt.
KSI’s hands being by his sides constantly says it all. He has no professional style.
I’m not you fan you lose and ksi won it was a robbery John a clown and Tyson I will beat tommy but it was a robbery
People enjoy the fury fight more then the Logan fight
That boy didn’t want to fight, hugged Tommy the whole time and cried about losing, good shit Tommy
Ksi was straight hugging that whole fight
ksi robbed
tommy literally landed only 1 punch more than JJ. and tommy thrown way more. that’s the statistic from dazn themselves not from these tommy fury fans whose argument is just ksi box weird.
Is it just me but didn’t KSI look like he had no energy after round 1 and a small bit in round 2. Tommy is the well deserved winner. Well done Tommy.
Only time Ksi landed was when he clinched and went for body shots
bro thinks the ring is a trampoline
That's what happened when a wannabe boxer fight with real boxer..he made himself embarrassing..
Okay taking a critical second look at this fight, its pretty clear that Tommy won.
Yeah KSI lost but Tommy just barely edged the win 😂 "professional boxer" struggled to beat a YouTuber and you lot are so proud about it lmao
Ksi fight plan = hugs and running….
JJ IS TRASH HE CAME TO HUG LAST NIGHT
YOU LOST BRUDDA
Ksi is a hugger not a fighter
11:26 29th hug of the fight by KSI 🤦🤦🤦🤣
The nigga tyson hit ksi in the back of the head two or three times tf
Lol boring
is this a relationship  or a fight? I can see hugs only
Ksi learned he can't hug his way to victory 😂
KSI was playing for that point deduction from the get go even tho he was also hitting tommy in the back of head
Every fucking one is talking about back shots while nobody was talking about ksi fucking lugging tommy and holding him every time he was forward and initiating an attack fckng biased ref ffs maan
10:08 23rd hug
In 3 rounds they gave eachother 20 hugs already
KSI should be a fitness instructor, definitely did the most Jumping Jack's, not much Boxing though.
Bro kei just danced the whole time 😅😅😂😂😂
They are in love with eachother. From the ring to the bed..!!
That was one hell of a hugging match.
Tommy should not have won but it’s the judges opinion
KSI pranced about like a wannabe thug just out of Wetherspoons, but on that performance Fury is miles away from fighting any kind of pro contender in the division.
YouTubers should never be in a boxing ring that was not boxing. That was more hugging and star jumps from KSI. I think next time there's a fight that involves the YouTuber. I think I prefer the s*** in my hands and clap
Ksi is an embarrassing boxer must have been frustrating for tommy to be put in the ring with an amateur like this dancing around scared he wouldn't stand a chance if he just stood there and boxed properly
This was painful to watch I think ksi thought this was wrestling.
KSI is an absolute bellend & should literally be the poster boy for imposter syndrome… the fact that he’s literally a god to gen z is the most gen z thing imaginable…
They threw more hugs than punches swear to God
Well done Tommy 👏🏻
Man does a couple star jumps then starts clinching who the fuck has trained this guy😂
WTF is this crap
all hail the delusional youtubers killer, Tommy Fury!!!
CONGRATS TOMMY !! U won fair and square. In fact after seeing the score cards, it should've been a unanimous decision for u bcoz one judge didn't add up his score cards correctly even though it favoured u.
Ksi is an absolute dosser man that was a whole new sport can we even call that boxing aha on my life the 1st proper fight on the card was a million times better than both the ‘main events’
Is this how boxing has become 😮😢
KSI stick to youtube bro
KSI kept ducking and expected fury to become a punching bag, also clinching over and over is not gonna get you anywhere, it honestly pisses me off how much JJ has degraded overtime, he saw how Logan kept clinching him and adapated to that, Just work harder instead of promoting some gay ass energy drink, disappointed.
This is boxing not hugging and dancing 💃
Not sure why are people calling this a robbery. Tommy won clearly. I have no idea what technique KSI was working on. Terrible.
ksi loss clear as water hahah
The referee is useless. In a normal boxing match this ksi bloke would have been disqualified after two rounds for holding.
I kenw it well done Tommy in the votes most people said ksi would win 😂 but you won insted
Ksi needed to be humbled.
Both a joke. But tommy saying wont go three rounds, then gets a split decision. Should hang his gloves up. Never will be world champion.
The fight of hugs wtf
That wasn’t boxing . Well done to Tommy for having to endure rounds with that idiot jumping around and grabbing him for a clinch , he knew he couldn’t stand and throw punches with Tommy.
go on Tommy. well done.
5:20 bruh right after fury gets 1 point for back of head punches ksi throws like 4 back of head punches
Youu didnt win
When you trynna fight that kid who spams clinch in the ufc games
I would say they're both on a similar level but KSI just did silly shit the entire fight for no reason so kudos to Tommy. Taking out YouTubers left and right.
TOMMY IS THE HERO WE NEEDED. ENJOY THE FAT PAYCHECK
Abysmal.  I like Tommy, he's a nice guy. But he's clearly not born to do this. He's been doing it his whole life as he keeps telling us, from a boxing family, had amateur fights, and couldn't even beat KSI, some guy who's been jokngly doing it a couple of yeas from his late 20s?...  Bruh.  Any half-decent boxer would knock KSI out in two seconds.  That was not a win. Even if he did win, which he didn't - f what the judges said - the people know; he lost 3 rounds AND a point deduction - in a 6 round 'fight'? which wasn't even sanctioned. Yeah okay. Fkn 'judges' prolly buddy buddy with the Fury family.  Total farce and a joke.
I didn’t know you could hold the that long. Ref would miss KSI’s headshots but not Tommy
Ksi is doing the mayweather tactic
Trash bruh ain't no way all I see is two dudes hugging the whole time good recording thoe
Yessir
LSI
Tommy is trash I see why be never fought a decent pro
This just shows tyson fury has true talent and it doesnt run in the famalia,  because if tommy was a pro he would have k.od ksi
So glad you won now we will finally get KSI vs Jake Paul
deserved win by tommy. seeing ksi act like a child and throw a fit after losing is really sad, as a ksi fan. couldn't even accept the loss like a man. its that logan paul influence.
A PROFESSIONAL BOXER BEAT A YOUTUBER BY 1 POINT😂😂😂
Ksi reminds me of when u play vs the kid that thinks hes all good. And tries showing off but starts crying when hes losing at whatever game we play
Ksi jst throwing one punch doin same moves
All that talk ksi did to just hop around the ring🤦🏽‍♂️😂
People paid to watch 2 grown man hug each other?😂
Tommy lost
I feel bad for Fury. All that training just to fight someone who'd rather hug it out in the ring.
Ksi Does jumping jacks 😂😂😂
Honestly better performance with Jake Paul than this guy bro but Congrats on the Win man.
Everyone subscribe. Let's get Tommy the 100k play button 🥊
KSI what a fking joke, the guy cannot box.
I've been seeing prime bottles littered all over the place, it just goes to show what type of people support these folks.
Ave seen better fights on the doors this is not boxing its a joke
Its easy to tell Tommy won that, with someone who wants to throw 2 jabs then Clinch you havent got much to work with so congrats to tommy for still getting the win with the point deduction, Big W tonight Tommy
KSI won the hugging match😢
Wtf… this is a garbage fight. Ksi fights like a guy from the street try’na land a haymaker
Ksi "the cuddler"
It can't be easy trying to box when your opponent just jumps around and hugs... people saying ksi was robbed are mad in the head Edit: I see a few of the mad in the head ksi riders are angry 😂😂
You deserved the win Champ❤ The next generation of Fury is ⚡️🔥
KSI was literally robbed of a win, if not a win then it was a draw Tommy couldn't keep up with JJ , His pace was to quick and Tommy was just protecting himself from JJ's punchrs and jabs.
All Kai did was throw a punch and clinch immediately cause he was scared of the response. Then quite a few times when Tommy’s glove literally just touched the back of his head he started crying like a soccer player. Lmfao wtf. KSI is the Lebron of boxing now 😂
HELL YEAH TOMMY🔥👊🏻
Ksi is garbage
Lol...bro i think this must go to KSI for all his hugs...and to all that jumping around shit
If anything all logan snd ksi did tonight was prove jake paul is a legitimate boxer, W for jake paul
good job Tommy, there's no place for youtuber clowns in boxing.
nah tommy is lucky because everybody knows ksi get robbed
Horrible Fight!
Lmao I was rooting for KSI & Lowkey thought it was a draw at first watching it live. This angle makes it look like more of  a JJ win not even including the point deduction.
1:49 Ksi is such a baby💀.
Well done Tommy.
Ksi lost as soon he came out with that hairline
People Who new that Tommy  Fury was going to win 🏆  👇
lets just hug it out dog
Even if u lot r Tommy fans u HAVE to admit it was closer than u lot thought (ofc i alr knew jj would prove em wrong)
feel sorry that ksi just kept hugging you tommy
So if ksi constantly turns his head to Tommy and his punch that would of landed on his face if he didn't fully turn his head, is a foul??
KSI trying to be a knock off Michael Venom Page😂😂
1:40 KSI punched Tommy in the back of the head first?? Yet everyone is going on about how that’s all Tommy did. But everyone is so up KSI’s backside they are blind to these illegal shots from KSI. KSI also did so many star jumps with no hands up but everyone is saying he’s the better ‘boxer’ 🤔🤭
Fury making pro boxers seem like theyre not all that. For a youtuber to get so close to winning
This isnt boxing, this is straight up hugging. Good thing I didnt pay for this shit.
Tommy you got smashed
Worst Fight of 2023 this niqqas is bozos
Well done tommy close fight but you defo got the win, guy was doing star jumps looking for 1 big overhand the whole fight, then clinching after every exchange. Its just because KSI has the bigger fan base that everybody is screaming "robbery". Congrats
Boxing boring NGL. They should ufc this
Congratulations on the win ant got a chance to watch it but I will be tonight 🎉
Ksi blocks everything with his face , he's got no boxing skillz
bruh u didnt win man hahah its only because of your name u won that fight with 1 point. u dont see it ksi been fighting for less years then u and u still only won with 1 point hahahahah
The only people that got robbed were who bought this.
Logan, Jake and KSI…. None of them are boxers. They are entertainers who know how to sellout a show
That has to be the worst fight iv ever saw , 2 grown men acting like there in school play ground fight
Stupid jumping or dancing and 53 hugs at least Yeah boxing
Was a shit fight but Tommy did win f***k ksi
yes tommmy love u and molly and bambi your a cute little family love you alll so much tommy looking forward to your next fight cant wait u are the best boxer i have ever seeen x
Get in Tommy, love seeing you put all these mouthy YouTube man boys in their place. Love to you and the Fam x
More hugs thrown than punches.
These youtube fights are trash. It's always just like....jab, clinch, "break it up!"
The second round that everyone is talking about. Rewatch that round.   Olatunji connected on 4 punches, and 3 of them confidently connected. Those being 3 right hands. The 4th punch was a jab that might of or might of not landed, as the angle couldn’t give me that information.  (The numbers don’t provide a sequential order but rather the amount of times both opponents connected)  Fury connected on 8 punches. 7 which confidently connected. There were a mixture of left hooks, maybe 1 or 2 jabs, and right hands. The 8th punch was a shot that I was questionable on as-well.  Fury wins the clean shots.  Now in the clinch I think Olatunji gets the better of those exchanges, but the judges are the judges of whether that punch or that punch is sufficient and clean enough for it to be counted.  When it comes to clean shots in the pocket, Fury connects more. (Fury) 7 to (Olatunji) 3 on shots that I think each opponent lands definitively.
In the moment it looked like ksi was robbed, after rewatching, tommy won this fair and square
Hard to watch tbh, ksi seems like he doesnt understand the sport
Very fast to hoy this up eh 💰😂
bro this fight is garbage!!
KSI deserved to win. I was on your side not anymore. And I know it doesn’t mean anything to you that I believe ksi won. But he was robbed. KSI WON. Not Tommy it was only the fury name and the fact that if a YouTuber won it would be damaging to the pro boxer career . (Also the punches to the back of the head a joke)
He was more accurate and the scoring was fumbled last minute and you can’t do that and tommy did not fight well either and he is the professional fighter if was definitely a draw even on the score cards it’s a draw tomm y cheated many times in the fight.
was this boxing or a crappling match?
I can't stand KSI i don't like has mouth I hate his voice.  And I really do hope this YouTube boxing stops .it's ruining boxing ffs
Ksi getting mad over the hits on the back of his head when thats what jes known for and was also doing it 🙄 😂😂😂😂
Ski clearly lost , kept hugging through no effective punches, terrible fight really, fury got the job done
Ksi ain't as good as people thought he would be
wow robbery weak gen of his family generation fighting a 2 youtuber lol
Clinchfest! What a dork
Suddenly everyone’s a boxer in these comments 🥱
Ksi should have won lets be real everyone hes only gonna show what he did good so guys lets say this if tommy fury was jake paul the would have said ksi win
Whole Card was Horrible Fights
Ksi was going down😂😂
Why did you try an pass 6th round as the 1st ? Idiot
I knew Tommy gonna destroy KSI and in the fight he was holding back a lot and so many power right punch were not done intentionally by Tommy. He could easily end the fight with K.O.
I dont know anything about boxing. How are the points countet? Like if its a ko its obvious who won but what about a fight like this. Is it who lands more punches or are there a lot of factors?
I don’t think KSI understood that you actually have to box, in a boxing match and not just dance around like a fairy. I mean Fury probably should have finished him, not so easy tough when the opponents thinks he’s in samba class.
KSI doing what cheers girls do
My two predictions came true
How did people think KSI won? All he did was clinch and miss the overhand right
Ksi is really good at making himself look like he’s doing something with his weird bouncing to his 1 haymaker clinch he looks like he’s busy but watch it he really isn’t 😂 judges did good 👍
I dont know how people think ksi won. What ksi has shown is disgrace to boxing 0 boxing skill only streetfight😂
Bro ksi was landing baby punches
Anyone saying KSi won this terrible fight is either trolling, hates fury or just a plain dumb*ss
KSI is a clown and Fury is a bum.
Shit fight
You lot want to go and watch the Barboza fight in the UFC last night for a fight, not this Circus 🎪😂.
The worst non-fight ever. Both of these clowns should be embarrassed, especially Fury. The fans were the clear losers
You are celebrating ‘winning’ against a youtuber. You are acc lost
All ksi did was clinch and then he thinks he deserves to win! Clown!
Why is ksi fighting like he's Roy Jones, guard yourself. All that clinching he's doing like this is UFC, I'm watching this entire fight saying "throw hands, and stop all that holding".
Ksi is not mvp
Jj had a more landed hit ratio to you tommy, you illegally hit him numerous times and it was ignored, you robbed jj of victory, and the fact you struggled against a youtuber in a event rigged in your favour, shows how "pro" you are 🤡
Ksi mad he lost, but it was his decision to make it 6. He dug his own grave.
What is with that dance? Ksi has had too much KFC !! Doing the funky chicken n that 😂🤣😂 everyone loving Tommy c'mon get up Tommy son 💪🏻💯
ksi fighting style is annoying 🤣
KSI made this fight sh#t to watch, only way he has any chance to not loose is this bs hugging 24/7. Trade and punch like actual boxers and tommy wins clearly
Ksi said he improved but is still windmill punching all the time
Neither of youse won that fight, all you did was hug each other😂cmon fury even jake did less than that but I respect your decision to touch gloves last round
Who really cares. How anyone could pay to witness this Dross, Beggars Belief
you people are delusional to think tommy won this sht boxing match when they rewatch the fight this is going to be a no contest
KSI is a joke
Tommy u won..but for all them years u say u ben boxing. Plz do a rematch for free after dis
This is quite possibly the worst fight I’ve ever watched…
ksi is a toddler when he gets a love tap to the back of his head
Ksi hug challenges
Anyone who thinks KSI won knows nothing about boxing😂
People complaining about ksi clinching when tommy clinched just as much.
Mate cant belive ksi thought he was gonna win
How can you box when your opponent doesn’t want to box😂😂😂😂
KSI won the jumping jacks match😂
KSI would literally kill himself in a fight in real life, hunting the opponents hands with the back of his head :P
Ksi def won
Man, ksi is a pus**, he keeps clinching and tucking his head in Tommy's chest. Wtf man, all that talk and you fight like this. So sad.
Let's fucking go tommy
KSI pulling a knock off klitschko impression hit and hold atleast klitschko had a dangerous set of hands
Lol just cus ksi made prime doesn't mean he's a boxxer lol
What a joke of a sport boxing has become.
back of heads shots 🤡🤡
This angle shows us tommy won forsure
16:30
Bro thinks this is karate
KSI got beat so hard he started crying post fight interview   Well done Tommy shutting up that high ego clown
Everyone who knows the sport of boxing know ksi who that fight. As a professional boxer you should know how to fight in the clinch for dirty boxing. I'm talking about rabbit punching and got deducted a point and still decided to keep throwing bad punches. Ksi landed cleaner punches won more rounds in my book. But this man could not loose because he'd be threw away from his daddy and brother lol. That's why they made sure he won because he couldn't do it himself. I think your a coward tbh and scared to loose a fight. Stop making excuses for loosing to a YouTuber if anything ksi was the better fighter it's simple to see. But fans are blind to anything when told to be lol
Hard to watch this pantomime
Ksi keeps putting his head down and turning away, of course you're gonna get hit in the back of the head. Fight like a man ksi, boo this man.
KSI WON THAT
KSI WONKSI WON
Looks like KSI just came to the fight to cuddle Tommy
I saw mvp in the crowd and instantly realised where ksi's unorthodox style came from.  To be fair to the lad he did bloody well, he made it look an even fight with his hugging gameplan.  It wasn't the best to watch but I feel if ksi tried to box you he would of been dominated from the get go
Is this boxing or what? lmao
How on earth do you have a professional boxing fight against someone that's doing star jumps around the ring, joke. Only thing he could try and throw was an over hand punch. That's not skill that's just ridiculous.
It was like ksi was on one of those dance floors where you have to be on beat to the music is he joking tommy you won hands down ksi looked like a puppet of strings and Logan Paul was his handler which still doesn’t know how to fight boxing is in your blood 🩸 it’s your dna and runs threw your bones
Ksi hugged the whole fight. I think he even tried to kiss Fury in roud 2 and 5. I think he was trying to apologize but Fury wasnt having it. 😂😂😂
Ksi stealing McGregor’s stance. What’s a fucking wannabe
Ye bro Tommy if you read this you destroyed him
Where was the power ksi talked about ? And where was his "im staying in the middle of the ring and fight you" ?
great win congratulations brother. Glory to God
I don’t care what anyone say Tommy fought like a pro KSI was fighting like a Road man. He was all over the place like an endless chicken, holding the man every minute, because he knew if he stands up and fight like a boxer he’s gonna get beaten, I supported Tommy all the way and I still supported told me all the way, so when I got up this morning to hear the news that he won, I was laughing😂💯💯💯💯🤣
Bruh ksi is jumping around like this Africans from National Geographic 😂😂😂
Ksi came for a a cuddle well done tommy you did what you could in a cheating situation from ksi side
Bro ksi was just jumping around and swinging without any technique, bro literally just trying to hit with overhand right. On the other hand tommy looked like he was ready for anything ksi brought.
KSI was just leaning against Tommy by the end of the fight. What a joke.
Draw
This shit was a hugging match
I can’t believe your all talking like this was a proper fight . If fury was as good as he thinks he should have ended it in two . Embarrassing I don’t care what you or whoever says it . Embarrassing we let this crap on our screens just so they can earn for it . Wankas
Love you Timmy! You did us proud in Manchester! 👌🙌 🥊 Why was KSI doing star jumps though ? ! 🙄
Can’t believe that KSI has been training to box. He looked really poor
Tommy can u fight logan and humble jake again
Fury definitely deserved the win but not being able to knock that wannabe boxer out is a bit embarrassing tbh. A decent boxer would have finished KSI within the first round.
All they did was clinch the whole freaking fight! What a joke!!
shows how bad Fury is, only just able to beat a queer youtuber
You landed one more punch and a lower percentage than a Youtuber... You're no Pro boxer. You're a sideshow just like them.
Don't know what this is, but the Furies have ruined boxing as a proper sport in the Uk. This is just circus tent sideshow entertainment for people who know no better. It's not boxing that I can tell you. And as for Tommy Fury...there's no chance of him getting brain damage in the ring : judging by his post fight 'interview.' He thinks he's actually fighting a boxer and is 10 and 0...undefeated.  Yeah Tommy...that's cos you've not had any fights. Brain damage ?...Nah I think he'll be just fine.
KSI dove in for the clinch every time Tommy tried to throw anything more than a jab. Every single combination
I don't know what KSi is complaining about.  There is no way he won that fight.  Mind you, this is second time Fury hasn't put an amateur boxer to bed.
Fucking goat❤❤❤❤
Boxing is dead
Ksi can’t box
Seen a better fight after the school bell..😂
Ref could’ve done a way better job breaking them up.
Ksi best anti-boxer ever 🤣 should sack his trainer for thinkin that was the style to use
Didn't think it was possible to upload this. Funny how ksi was pulling a Pineda. Congrats on the win.
Who in the world trained KSI to do this? This is not even 14 year old amateur level boxing and he is fighting Tommy Fury?  Please, this industry has become a joke.
First 2 rounds were ksi's and Tommy kept stepping in when jj stepped in making alot of the clinches happen. 3rd rounds Tommy. 4th round draw but Tommy did hit after the bell. 5th round was Tommy's. 6th round ended short on here but was a draw for sure, also to note 2 consecutive back of the head shots by Tommy. So should've been either a draw or after point deduction ksi win. Tommy didn't put up enough of a show to win even after point deduction.
Ksi got robbed
What’s ridiculous is that KSI knocked people out with elbows and kept jumping around hugging, now he complains about unfairness and gets robbed after losing fair and square lol
I THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS 😂😂😂😂 WHEN KSI ACCUSED TOMMY OF PUNCHING THE BACK OF THE HEAD...WHEN I CLEARLY DONE A ZOOMED IN FRAME BY FRAME 🪟🪟🪟 AND HE HIT ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD...... CONGRATULATIONS TO MY BROTHER TOMMY FURY..... LET'S GO !!!!! FUCK KSI THE CRYBABY
Ksi went pineda in the end😂
You got a new sub.   You did great you came to slug.        My respect.
Ksi thought it was a hugging match 🤣🤣
Tommy did not win that fight , if anything its a fucking draw Ksi clinched a lot but not once in this entire fight did tommy have ksi , Ksi landed blows and shook tommy numerous times. Fight without boxing restrictions and we know who wins because clearly the ones who favored tommy are completely biased.
An actual boxer barely winning against a youtuber💀
The amount of time tommy hugging ksi lol and looks like tommy is looking for a ddt😂lmao
To be fair i think KSI Did more damage in the clinch
The commentating on these misfit cards have gotten worse and worse. Just completely biased ! Watching this with or without commentary will show ksi was never winning with all this hugging
The problem is that KSI keeps fighting bums like swarmz and Pineda from Mexico   Now that he has a proper fight his holding and hugging fury like his girlfriend   Clearly jumping up and down like a kangaroo won’t win you fight against a professional fighter like Tommy
People know nothing about boxing. Don't know how to count punches and clean shots vrs ones that aren't.   Get out of your feelings. Just because you wanted bro see someone that wins all the time get beat.      Tommy threw less shots. Connected less shots and gotta point deduction.    It's just he landed more clean shots. But umm yeah this was dead even. Clinching for those who don't know. Makes you lr opponent tired quickly.   So it's a fight tactic.   Very smart. He just did it a lil to much.    I call this even. Slight edge to ksi.    But I'm not made if you say tommy won.
KSI looking like Goro 🤣
Tommy was fucking clinching him bro evidence Is here
I think ksi trained how to become a white blond british lady by doing all that jumping jacks instead of fighting
From  what I can see they did more hugging than punching.
Ya all know damn well ski fucking demolished tommy fury
First minute of this fight is 10x better than the logan paul fight
Yeah I agree lol. Ksi was trippin 😂 And I was tired of watching his boxing stance. Who taught him to fight like that?
Well done Tommy ! You did well & know your only gonna get better under the lights . It’s So great you beat that guy because he used to be funny n cool but then turned into a real monster , rude , pigheaded asshole . When he spat at your father and generally acting the way he was up to the fight it was inevitable. Guys a kunt 😂maybe he’ll come down to reality or be Beyoncé wild about it . Seem to trend unfortunately racism from there side . One love Tommy and all warmest regards to your beautiful family 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  BRAVO SIR TOMMY !!! BRAVO  !!!
Tommy's like: "if you wanted a hug, you could've just asked" 😂
Every contact made by ksi is a clinch,the dude is areal clown
Wtfff is this bs so boxing is not a mans sport any mo? What a time to live🤮😡🤡🤡🤡
The problem here is the referee, he has to give a point reduction to ksi if he doesnt box
K(linch)SI
Can everyone see JJ hitting tommy in the back of the head and he’s not complaining?
5:12 - 6:00 I REST MY CASE, ksi was literally beating him up for 3 rounds straight and realistically won the last 3 too draw at worst.
Can’t believe this is what boxing has come to, I grew up training for 9 years, so sad to see these are types of matches being made, still up’s to you Fury hard to box someone who doesn’t want to
To do fair both clinched ss tommy lost
look at 08:06 KSI came to hug, nothing else.
KSI looked stupid and unprofessional doing those star-jumps
Every time I skip 10 seconds,  they hugging! 🫂
Yo tommy boy you looked awful, you disgraced your family with that shite performance. Tf were you doing?
KSI does half jumping jacks while he fights   Just do this on the streets and not on a boxing ring
Both are amateur. Pussycats making boxing look like gayboxing
This is not boxing
Good for the pocket tommy but I don’t feel like you’re getting any better fighting these guys.
Horrible fights cause of ksi tactics
GaySI won..... The hugging competition anyway. Did you see how many hugs he landed compared to Tommy
For those who think it’s a robbery really need to rewatch the fight, Tommy won that fair and square. Good win Tommy👑
Total garbage these kind of fights need to stop !
You lost Tommy
What the actual fuck is JJ doing? All he is doing is jumping up and down.   Where are his fucking hands like what the fuck 🤦
Ksi was the reason that fight was so bad tommy was there to fight ksi was there to cuddle
AWFUL display from KSi, he came to survive, and stunk the place out because of it. Better for you to have these weird fights early in your career and learn from them, Overall another win in the books, now on to the next one, Well done.
I think Ksi just has a crush on Tommy that's why he wanted to fight him so he could hug him the whole time.
Yet another failure in Fury’s part to live up to his firm statement that he was going to knock out KSI!!!!  He will never reach world class status in the boxing arena. Not good enough.
Imagine YouTube takes this down 💀
Ksi busy hugging fury 😂😂
JJ clinched like 873 times bruh he looked like a fool
I watched a min and 45 seconds and that’s the enough time I had to waste bye.
Thank you for uploading the fight before Dazn or ESPN.
Dillon made Logan look like he had an extra chromosome and KSI is making Tommy look like he’s a real professional misfits sucks
Tommy won this ksi was hugging him every 2 seconds
Now ksi is exposed he is just a junkie in boxing but totally no skills 😂😅😊
I still believe you one king. Good job
Ksi’s whole style is dogshit not even great pro boxers dance around with their hands fully down like that, honestly I don’t think much of Tommy in this fight either, an amateur boxer with great fundamentals could beat them both in my opinion
ksi won
the fact that he's posted himself gettin beat up on his own channel shows that there isn't a single part of this fight he won. They couldnt even find a clip to make him look good. "Tommy is a real boxer" "tommy was trying to have a real boxing match" man has posted himself throwing illegal punches 1:38 hahahahahahah absolute L he lost and i dont even like ksi but he blatantly won. Ksi worked hard and i respect that, only to get robbed.
Is there really that much people that think it was a robbery because holy shi
I'm so glad you got the W tommy. I know ksi was making it a clinch fest. After every exchange he was trying to smother your combos and returns by tieing you up instead of countering your shots or using head movement or foot work. Trying to outland you in the clinch to steal the W. I will never watch ksi box again but I'll definitely keep watching you though tommy. I was happy that john and tyson saw the fight abit like this to and still gave you your credit :)
First round Tommy had 3 choke holds and 2 shots directly to the back the head how no point deduct
Ksi, more hugs thrown than punches
Jj gotta fix his like boxing stance cuz what is bro tryna do??? FLY?
Next time sign up a newbie referee important not a paid moron by ksi😅😂😅
KSI looking like an ALDI Deontay Wilder stood on a pogo stick
I think people thought ksi won because they thought tommy would dominate easily but since it didnt happen they think ksi won. Tommy fury is the true winner
You definitely lost that
Cant even call this a fight...literally clinching every 3 secs....ref shud have done more to stop it n make it a boxing match. Shud have also warned jj for constantly comin in wiv his head down.
Ksi W
I like ksi, funny dude. But you cant argue the fact tommy won, anyone saying tommy looked awkward doesnt realise what an unorthodox style ksi is using tommy probally didnt really know what the fuck to expect 😂
KSI better do MMA
Bro ksi was so boring to watch because all he did was fucking clinch, they should honestly start deducting points after a while but anyways good fight Tommy
i really would have liked to see the live chat for this fight but i didnt want to pay but i would bet the live chat would have been so hilarious...
Ohh shut u mf ...calling himself a professional cant even knock out a youtuber shame😂😂😂
EAD learn how to *box* 💀
Dude doing jumping jakes the whole fight wtf😂
Ksi is trash that was so terrible if I see Ksi I’m taking my belt off
KSI cried too much thru this fight.  He wanted to  whine about the back of his head but he is the one that kept dropping his head low.  Bruhhhh
Embarrassing performance tommy . If thats your levels then your definitely best fighting non boxers lad. Dont get me wrong tommy scraped the win but shockibg quality on tommys boxing ability. Terrible fight between two non professional boxers lets be honest. Shane fury reckons this is tommys level
Your a baby . showing the world .more to gypies life..we get  run down .show them . Think your young .more to come .do it Tommy for all off us xx
These ksi fanboys are still complaining through the tears lmao
This shit goofy asf boxing is not real anymore. KSI doesn’t even know how to box
I knew Tommy would win ever since Ksi tried to shove him in the press conference. Blud pushed HIMSELF back.
Tommy likes hitting people in the back of heads I see
Pair of bums
And people still pay for that bullshit not true boxing ?
Ksi bitchin..about getting hit in the back of the head watch what he does every time he drops his head down he did the same thing against Logan Paul and he ended up winning cuz logan lost a point and he tried doing it time..He knows he can't beat Tommy...He can't box anyone who has seen real boxing knows KSI can't Box for sh!t
Thank you tommy fury for humbling all of these egotistical kids ruining real fighting
possibly the most boring match of 2023, ties with dillon and logan. the only time anyones eyes widened was when dillon swung at security
Tommy wasn't kidding when he said he takes punches from tyson since he was small cause he ate everything the fairytale I mean nitemare had to offer an shook it off no prob
Its acttualy pretty funny that KSI really thought he will absouletly annihilate Tommy by a knockout.And then he was hugging the whole fight thats probably how much he have hugged his whole life.Take an L balerina of the ring.😂
Looks like ksi have watched some of the Naseems fights :)
Holy fucking boring!
People actually pay to watch this 😂
What kind of fight stance that. Ksi doesn’t keep his hands up. He thinks he’s a mortal kombat character
KSI thought it was a hug and clinch match
Ksi hasn’t been able to box since the start he thinks a couple of muscles and a bad attitude is enough
Smh, ksi telling the ref to deduct for Tommy touching his braids
fury didnt deserve the W
Funny to see KSI crying about the back of his head in this fight too
When fake boxer meet the real one he plays the taekwondo stands😂😮😅
Tommy clearly won Ksi thought he was in a hugging contest 😂
What’s it gonna take for somebody to KO these youtubers for real??! Im tired of their unfounded ego.   P.s: wtf was this “fight”. No real punch was thrown. Only hugs 😂
KSI’s coach was literally telling him to get in the clinch nearly everytime he went to the corner, very poor from his team and KSI for attempting to win like this.
I’ll be honest never step foot in pro boxing again. Maybe train for the health benefits but don’t fight please😂even if he does he’s a liar he said he shouldn’t fight again if the fights even slightly close and he won on a dodgy decision
The black one think Its Thai boxing
Idk anything about boxing but why are they hugging like every 15 seconds😂
Knew ksi would get smoked, glad to see him humbled.. he's a sore loser 😂😂😂😂
Ksi was hugging lol
You should be embarrassed. Couldn’t knock ksi or his forehead out.
New gay love story😮
well done tommy lad
I knew Tommy wud win 🎉
KSI couldn't have made himself more predictable with the same overhand right into a clinch and then what's with all his jumping about and swinging his arms? Wasting so much energy. Also he was stood too sideways. Can't defend himself properly or punish bad hits when one arm is basically behind the fight. Tommy is the better fighter 100%
Why tf is jj just jumping around. Talked all that shit and performed like that smh
Well done mate.  Awkward fight going against someone doing star jumps and wanting to give you cuddles, but you got the W that's what counts.
What is this world record of Hugs giving ?  :D
Is this a fight or a hugging contest 😂😂😂
Ksi won this
both ksi and tommy fury were shit in that fight , tommy had a rubbish performance and barley hit jabs only landing in the clinch and ksi dose not even fight like a boxer with all the bouncing and wild throws regardless tommy repeatedly punched ksi in the back of the head and was far worse on the attack i thought ksi should have won robbery tbh
You lost the fight and it's something you'll always have to live with. You did a lousy job that night. I thought you were an amateur. Another thing, stop mentioning the Lord Jesus Christ in your speeches; He doesn't side with liars and hypocrites
KSI practicing kung-fu in the garage style, garbage
Tommy won but he's never gonna be a serious contender he ain't got it
Worst professional boxer ever
He hits you hard behind the head and you tap him on the back the head and he goes down. What a joke.
Probably the most boring fight someone could ever watch 👀😂😂
Got to learn to bait tommy id love to boxs ksi id destory him
in my opinion you lost buddy ksi shoulda won that shit
God that was embarrassing
That referee should get paid more than he was promised😂😂
Mga fury sobrang panget maglaro! Puro balya tapos suntok kamaganak kau ni meyweather Dapat wrestling laro nio ndi boxing!!! Paano nanalo Ang Wala nman nagawa sa kalaban at Siya pa binugbog nito!!!! Kalakaran nnman Ang umiral!!!! Tsk tsk tsk!!! Mas malaki Pala score ng yakap kesa sa suntok!!! Kaya Pala undefeated si meyweather
Ksi or paul or jake are NOT  boxers...
when i saw the angle from the fight from the cameras i thought ksi deserved the win, but watching from here feels different
My boi ksi really has his own street fighter boxing stance .  That gotta be in a video game soon.. that shit fire
Fair tommy well done mate you won that
“Tommy won because I don’t like Ksi’s technique” that’s not how boxing is scored. Ksi landed more punches per round then Tommy did and somehow the round where Tommy clearly lost and had a point deducted still want as a round win for Tommy. Clear curruption
Well done Tommy, awful fight but you won, his MVP style of fighting doesn’t work without kicks, even Venom Page loss to Mike Perry proves this!
You CLEARLY won , he is not able to fight you I just have to cuddle to survive
Crazy how much the commentary impacts the way the fight is seen. Watching this back again without the commentary its much clearer that the judges decision was correct.
Whats with the Taekwondo bounce? Looks like a total tool
ksi should have won  and u should havbe gotten disowned trash boxer
Soooo much hugging... 😂
Round 1- KSI, hard to tell for sure but he landed more consistently out of the clinch. There were also clear shots to the back of his head by Tommy. Round 2- KSI, close round but landed more consistently towards the end of the round. Very easily could go either way. Round 3- Tommy, controlled every aspect of the round.. landed more, used his reach and worked the clinch well Round 4- Tommy, KSI didn’t throw enough more or less handing the round to Tommy who had some clean shots outside of the clinch Round 5- KSI, probably the worst round for both fighters. Very few connections outside the clinch, although a bit more aggression from KSI Round 6- KSI, puts a strong finish in to end the fight and I’m my opinion it should’ve paid off. Got a lot of respect for both fighters but I think this was a bigger credit to KSI. He didn’t look like a fish out of water as Jake did and stood toe to toe with a pro. Tommy should’ve won this with the majority I have against him. Maybe the creator scene is more competitive than he will admit
im not biased to either of you but what a scrappy fight and how the hell do u win that Tommy, it was a even fight but the point deduction was the factor that should lost you that fight. you didn't dominate the fight so how did you gain 3 points. 1st K 10 - 9 T 2nd K 10 - 8 T 3rd K 9 - 10 4th K 9 - 10 T 5th K 9 - 10 T 6th K 10 - 9 T    K 57 - 56 T  that the way is should of been. you 100% didn't win all 4 rounds as you only threw 19 jabs the whole fight. but KSI wasnt exactly a star performer either.  should of been a draw if anything
😢😢😢wat is ksi doing😂
whats up with the jumping jacks and clinching? KSI was boring and scared to stand up and fight.
im a ksi fan but wtf did i just watch. the fact he thinks he was robbed is nuts. tommy fought awful too. ksi hands down or waving around while jumping back and forth the sprinting into an over hand right it was like watching my 9 year old cousins fight
The goat ❤
Feel sorry for the generation that have these clowns as their boxing reps. Don't worry Benn, Calzaghe, eubank, Collins, Lewis, Bruno, mcguigan, Ahmed your legacy is well n truly safe.
KSI just hugging him the whole fight 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅
Fantastic video
Tommy fury can't box an egg
The referee was trying his best to make Tommy not win lmao
robbery
None yall can fight
tommy won fair and square right at the start ksi tried hitting him in the back of the head whilst hugging him
He hugged you more than he hugs his girlfriend 😂🎉.
if set slow motion you can see that ksi was holding all the time not tommy
KSI said he was gonna shock the world, the only thing that was shocked was his ego after getting the L
😂😂🤡
Why ksi remind me of flappy bird 💀
Shame of boxing with YouTubers and all waste 😂boxing
First 2 Rounds KSI won 10-9 and 10-8..Thats why it should be a at least a Draw..He got robbed
It’s sad how I thought KSI was a decent boxer trying to get a hit off then running back then starts grabbing if you get remotely close to him 🤦🏽‍♂️
KSI got destroyed
Hops—>big right swing—>hugs
These YouTubers are not actual boxers
fuck a pro fighter almost lost to a YouTuber in the fight I thought ksi was winning but this fuck up world won't let a pro fighter lost to a YouTuber they're willing to do anything to let tommy win 😂😂😂it's almost sad I'm not a ksi fan nor a tommy fan but seeing a pro boxer almost lost but talks like he ko him sad and pathetic
Robbed
You lost you didn’t deserve the win ksi won the rounds and you kept hitting him in the back of the head it’s a robbery
Ref's warning the wrong fucking guy. Warn ksi he needs to work not just hug the whole time. Boxing sucks
Tommy shouldn't fight any more Youtubers, he should go on to fight real boxers since he's a real boxer himself. If Youtubers wants to fight Tommy, then Tommy should tell them to earn it first.
Nothing happend
It wasn’t a fair fight. Fury has all that extra landing zone for punches on ksi forehead lmao. Thing is massive
Ksi is Rubbish why is he jumping all rounds
KSI really embarrassed himself 😅
It looks like Tommy wants to be a YouTuber now, at least he is the best influencer boxer in the world now
Ksi giving congratulations hugs since round 1
'Full fight' but conveniently starts after the big shot that KSI landed at the start of round 1. Also known as the best punch of the fight. Both of them were absolute cheeks tbh.
I don't like jake paul but i think he was a better opponent to tomy
Close and awkward fight but im happy for you mate
Wait how do people think ksi won the first round ??????
Ksi clinching constantly
I like Tommies boxing shorts, they look nice.
Boring boxing match stalled continuously by KSI clinching.
My bro you lost🤡
I honestly feel like ksi could beat jake not because he’s a better boxer just bc he’s a sloppy fighter by decision will be a close fight
What a real real SHAME an old loved sport like boxing comes to this?What a load of crap any unlicensed boxer with more than a few fights beats these loads of garbage its shocking young people are so easily guided ,I pity there brainwashed future
I think KSI just wanted a hug from Tommy.
Don't matter if Tommy didn't K.O KSI. Winning is Winning!
Him grabbing the back of his head after getting in a clinch is pissing me ofd
Ksi sucks
What I joke ksi is he is embarrassing himself
Ksi adapted Floyd Mayweathers technique😂
Yep because getting a point deduction for blatant punches to the back of the head and then CONTINUING to do so and not getting penalised is the work of a PrOfEsSiOnAl boxer. You're a joke and a cheat.
Tommy should stick to fighting YouTubers a real boxer would destroy him how embarrassing.
Runing all the time , jumping , huging all the time, very stupid boxing style with hands down ... I liked Johns Fury words : It was to dificult for Tommy to look realy realy  good with the guy who is just jumping  , runing and playing wrestling all time..... Happy that Tommy won !
Tommy lost
Ksi fights like a middle school kid
I love how Tommy thanks The Lord, that really makes me happy. God Bless you Tommy and stay humble. 😇👍
I know it’s exhibition but you got 1 guy boxing and 1 guy street fighting stupid fight but people entertained by it
KSI looks like he was trained by Steve Irwin and a Kangaroo...
So glad i didnt pay £20 to watch to guys hug. What happened to good old fashioned punch up not this hugging crap...
tommy fury sucks couldn’t even knock this clown down dude had his sands down the whole fight
a boxer vs a jumping clown lol
Wtf is ksi doing. Hes not even boxing . People who say he won have never boxed in their lifetime. Wtf was ksi doing ive seen better 12 year olds boxing in my amateur gym
There is some people think ksi was robbed 😂
Ksi boxing technique is shit. Yes it’s awkward, but it’s shit and had it gone on longer he would have been knocked out in like round 8 or so
Boy kept hugging this man
Watched it for like 40 seconds and turned it off. What on earth happened to the sport of boxing. This here is a shitshow
Just remember, Tommy Fury was supposed to destroy both Jake Paul and KSI. Instead he has people questioning scorecards lol
boxing sucks it’s just a huggin match
Ksi is just Surviving [KSI is Trying to Survive 😂
I don’t see how people had Ksi winning anything. He just threw wild shots and hug when he felt like he was about to get hit.
The amount of back of the head shots from a “pro boxer” is crazy and he only got one point deducted when it should have been at the bare minimum 2
Fury is a clown. Making a joke of himself now
I have been in boxing myself and that would be one of the worst fights i have ever seen not sure this does much for the Fury name.
Idk why Tommy just hugged it out every time
Glad I didn't pay to watch a hug match
Ones a boxer ones a youtuber whoelse was going to win
Jab, head down, overhand and grab, rinse n repeat and he says he got robbed, 😂😂😂 Congrats Tommy
Been a boxing fan for 25 years and a amateur for 4. You won that fight 4-2 easy. KSI had zero combinations and single shot jabs the whole time. He was also the one engaging the clinch. Helwanis commentary was pretty awful as well.
KSI is a cardio coward, that’s why he pushed for a 6 round fight. Only plan was to survive, he would have been absolutely floored if that was an 8 or 10 round fight.
I turned it off as soon as ksi complained about the back of the headshots after initiating a clinch for like 10th in 2 minutes
Pfft please guys stop boxing now, it’s becoming like wwe, okay made your money, had the shows please no more
at least they would swing like crazy in the clinch
This whole fight was a Pause or an Ayoooo 😂Do you get points for Hugging?
You lost that, anyone with eyes can see that clear as day
Sake that ref asap to much hugging from ksi and the ref let them fight like that tommy you definitely won that fight mow plz stay away from these YouTube fools fight a real fighter 🥊🥊🥊
They both looked like clowns to be honest
Tyson fury would whoop both at the same time
I knew KSI would lose when going up against a real fighter. GG Tommy.
top 5 baddest fights of all time 🤣🤣🤣
The fact this fight took place is a joke.
Ksi`s performance was awful... Congratulations Tommy!
Ksi felt the fury 😅
Congrats Tommy.. I can't wait for your next chapter!
Ksi soft
So glad KSI has been humbled! Far too confident in his boxing ability, when all he does is just throw wild punches
Everytime ksi went in for a hit he clinched straight after. Soon as tommy went in for a hit ksi clinched him. To say that ksi won is a mind of an idiot. It's clear ksi can't stand and tee off on eachother because everytime tommy tried to make that happen again ksi went for the clinch
Ref seemed happy to tell Fury off but not KSI.....wats that all about 🤷
L for Ksi
ref sucks
Ksi try to copy Mike’Venom’ Page styl thats why its venom style it only work for him this guy a embarrassing
I think the judges were completely right with the decision because Tommy was landing everytime KSI was trying to throw the wild punches. The clinching from KSI was embarrassing
Tommy went to fight and KSI went for cuddles. Joke of a fight. Well-deserved the win Tommy!
Why he jumping up an down like a fool ?
Everybody can punch only some can fight. NC
might be one of the worst refs I've ever seen
That ref needs saked ASAP
Literally a draw
All LSI did was hug and run and also deduct points… he is literally a joke not a good boxer. Jake Paul did so much better against Tommy than his LSI did against Tommy.
This cross over boxing thing needs to come to an end what aload of jarg.
Not gonna lie. KSI looked more like a ballerina than a boxer. He should stick to the internet.
KSI is embarrassing, people think he deserve a fight with Jake 😂 he needs to earn it
veliki pozdrav iz Srbije.Tomm,yNeka te čuva Gospod Isus Hristos ,Amin
what an absolute insult ksi grabbing and clenching everytime hes in the firing range and yet has the audacity to throw an elbow at 12:38 into this video look closely
robbed ksi battered him for 6 rounds stright
Fire that ref
Tbh ksi git robbed cause Tommy didn’t get his point deducted for some punches in the back of the head
You can literally skip 5 minutes and nothing has changed. Very boring match but that was down to KSI's tactics.
Ksi claiming he got robbed like shut up kid, all he did was hug the whole fight like Anthony Taylor 💀
Yeah I agree it doesn't look like a boxing match .ksi show boating trying to look cool .no defense there's alot of graping .I can see how it was awkward for Tommy. Tommy threw more punches deserved winner .if honest he needs to start getting in the ring with real boxers .ksi turns up to your boxing gym swinging his hands by his side .he's in the ring .Happy days all day .that ain't boxing. More like street fighting. You got to give the sport your doing respect .it's a skill boxing.
Ksi looks nervous but Tommy looks clam n collected. Ksi clinching because he knows Tommy is better. Tommy had the same look against Paul.
Looks like the guys barely trying
The free undercard was WAY BETTER than PPV…I will NEVER pay to watch non-professional “boxer’s” as long as I live…Jake would be the only one I’d spend a buck on because he actually works his ass off and takes it seriously…these other guys are a literal joke! 🎯🎯🎯 💯💯💯
Wts going on here Tommy all he does hugging ksi how he won wthell guys
The most boring fight ever KSI just keep hugging you bro and cheating. But thank you for being awesome bro! Thanks!
https://youtu.be/stGL8ryINFc?si=KCruNv-4tdnqYDGJ
This ref was  working for ksi for sure
KSI fought just like Jake Paul..... Retreat, when Tommy advances, hold him instead of boxing with him. 😒
Ill be honest KSI looking like Walmart MVP or make a wish wonderboy Thompson. Tommy got too greedy looking for the ko.
Robbery ksi won that and even if they didn’t wanna give him the win it’s at least a draw you only won because of your last name
KSI sucked. He is a good cuddler tho
Why is he jumping around 😂😂😂😂 this isn't boxing 😂😂😂😂
The bell kept going early everytime tommy came on strong ending the round
Idiot ksi
you won the fight cognate tommy.
Am I trippin or does KSI just keep holding & punching crazy while he’s holding?? 🤷🏽‍♂️
Ksi wins 💯 sure 👌🏼
not Tommy's or KSI's fan, but let's be honest, we all know KSI is more like a clown than a fighter.
What a poor performance from a so called “professional” let’s wait until this is appealed. The fact that this gimp is celebrating this win is embarrassing.
Well done Tommy Ksi was horrible and very unsportsmanlike
As happy as I was seeing ksi lose, you’ve got to start going harder on these YouTubers. You shouldn’t be surprised to win a decision over these guys. We need destruction. I understand not taking out ksi because he wanted to cuddle instead of fight but if you continue fighting YouTubers show them you’re the real boxer 🤝
What a shit fight
So much bout JJ meeting Tommy in the middle of the ring His boxing technique is 🤜🏃
If this is boxing then no thank you
Was that a boxing Fight or A huging competition?
How the fk are people paying to watch this disgrace  is beyond  me .. we live in a world full of delinquents
Not really an achievement is it!
LSI trying to fight dirty. Glad he lost.
Oh my word that was one way fright for Ksi Tommy smash him Ksi can’t box he is just jumping around like it’s a jumping Jack day at the gym hands by his side sorry Ksi you need to learn how to box I am not a boxer but I know we’re my hands are meant to be protected your self at all times it’s not a dance-off and you have one punch over hand we’ll play Tommy for boxing 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wtf is ksi on no joke they both talked a good fight but we definitely didn't see that but tommy did his best and to much hugging from ksi well done tommy 👏
Ksi got his ego checked 😂
KSI hasn't appealed yet, don't celebrate early. If it goes to you, then props. If not, 9-1. Btw you hit JJ in the back of the head 4 or 5 times. Clearly no concern for another man's health.
ksi trying to copy michael vemon pages style of fighting 😂.
I honestly had ksi up by 1or2 rounds so i was actually shocked that tommy won that but putting that aside surly tommy cant be happy and continue saying he is going to fight pros when he won in a massively controversial manner against a YouTubers as people put it jumped around the whole time
Go on Tommy mush I knew u could it
Yeah fury do you know what brain damage is all you where doing is head shots ksi got in you in born cheek what born what in your mouth ksi won that he hit him mouth and got some other shots the owner thing you where doing is kept on hold in on to him and punched him in head non stop wish is ksi got you in born cheek of your mouth score cards are trash he was robbed you siad ksi not pro boxer all that crap mate where pro boxing gone you where cuddling him like his your teddy bear just kept hold in on to him you punched him in the back of the head it’s crap how can the vote for you  like you got point took away for do in that you punch him in the head it was even boxing match from you and you say your pro boxer what happened mr pro boxer who player dead and it was not even boxing what happen 3D round you did knock him out mate Jake pual knocked you to the ground you never every sipped he punch your face wish made you fall to the ground and lose who got pushed bye ksi you just stood you siad he was scred you where stand in they when you got up fight your dad you stood like nothing fin air you where weee not in 2 yeah old kids ground you stand they like one you hade nothing just head shots that was it no face ksi got your cheek still clasted is face punch he got you in face sorry pal just to unlecky felly you the one who hit face you just when for head shots non stop hold him like he is teddy bear or some thing he’s not it’s boxing some grab on the opponents like what they do but they not like you grab.

Ksi won what are guys talking about wath the
Hey, listen. There is only ONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Tommy FURY! What are you going to say about that KSI, huh?
Retire.
Wtf is this they hugged more than they faught
I never really watched a boxing match before is all this hugging legal? And more importantly has consent been given?!
This is why boxing sucks. You can play at boxing. You can't play in mma.
I'm 4 mins in and I'm done watching this .. I hate amateurs all he did was clinch🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
you lost bro, awfull boxer. 0 respect for you at all
8:04 this part made me scream. Guys just kept hugging.
Tyson deffo Bribed ref
Tommy and Jack was a way better fight
People who know fighting can see Fury won
Ksi was robbed
Ksi keeps putting his under fury’s arm wth is that???
KSI should do MMA since he seems to prefer grabbing over striking
That was embarrassing for both of them what the hell is going on with Tommy Fury he was fighting good with Jake Paul and I don't understand what ksi doing he looks like he's trying to fly like a bird
Ksi literally didn't wanna engage and fight but he won ??? And tommy every fight you've proved your a class act musch respect too you and congrats on finally shutting this ego maniac up
Everyone was hating on Logan when he kept grabbing KSI very few people moaning about KSI grabbing Tommy. This fight would have been different if KSI actually boxed
Terrible fight Ksi definitely lost
The ref should of stopped the fight to check Ksi shoes for trampoline parts
Deleting any positive comments for ksi nice 😂😂😂
A bunch of rabbit punching and clinching….
Wtf was ksi doing that's not boxing that's dancing the tosser
y’all all glazers tommy the one clinching 😂
Everyone saying it was a hugging match that’s not Tommy fault Ksi didn’t wanna feel the power just jumped around then chuck the other hand but you did the job Tommy well done mean so much if you get in touch brother ❤
These two are lovers? They do hug a lot.
listen idk who hyped ksi’s head up about that ridiculous power bomb he constantly threw but wow did they set him up for failure 😂😂😂 you’re not that guy pal 😭😭😭
you can tell ksi was scared to actually box tommy, so he went for the unclassical hug and tug with tommy. Tommy went in to box, ksi went in to hug?
Sad how bias DAZN is.  It pays when you own the event
Clench-SI
KSI 1 punch wonder....
Not excatly Benn v McCellan is it
LOL the Fansly advertisement on the ropes
Proud of you Tommy man, propa english man. You done the job an your kid is now (an hopefully more kids for your legacy) are set. Bang on my man. Your a true ENGLISH KNIGHT. God bless
Well done Tommy 🥊
KSI Should be on dancing with ⭐️
congrats tommy, the real fighter won on the night easy, ksi is a hug merchant
Tommy was the only person boxing.. I wonder what sport my brother KSI was doing 😅😅!
KSI was putting his head in Tommy's face constantly. He should have had a point deducted for that.
Tommy mate your a nutter if you think you won ksi were bullying you with less weight and then you had to keep throwing shots to the back of the head and pinning his arms cuz you can’t clinch saw that many headlocks thought I were watching mma tbf to jj he should’ve threw and elbow or head but to make it fair your family think there so good you got Tyson that’s it
Ksi a bum lmao
From what I can see ksi lost by getting counter punched repeatedly
The commentary was unreal lol.. felt like they were trying to brainwash me
Ksi should have no disrespect but he should have won
One of the worst so called fights ever
All fighters did badly on the night this is the second amateur boxer you have struggled to put down time to hang up the gloves and admit your just a reality TV personality
nobody got robbed my man just salty kids cant admit defeated winning is fucking winning!! Yes My Man!!!!!!
Good god, ksi cant fight, bro needs to grapple everytime he’s getting punched😂
Bro this just shows Tommy clinching to survive
Im admittedly a boxing causual. I've always been more into MMA. That being said, does every boxing fight consist of guys clinching every 15 seconds? Or is it just when professionals fight youtubers?
KSI IS A HUGGER A
You landed  2 power punches? ksi landed 4, and you had like 10 jabs? clearly you were confused? you didn't even know how to hit him when you had his hand locked uner your arms, and you were the one going for the hugs with your hands up in the air hitting the back of his head when he faced down
HE GOT RIGGED HAAAAAA
Is K.S.I trying to fly and it was to much clenching
This ain’t a boxing match, this is porno. 😂
That is robery tommy hit ksi in the back of the head so many times and didn't get deducted a point plus I don't think that should be majority decision at best a draw
seems like KSI's whole game plan was to stall as much as he could until he got into a clinch so tommy could tap him on the back of the head so he can cry to the ref about it. what a disappointment from KSI. i didn't expect him to win but i at least expected him to box.
🎉
No he was he kept punching him back if hear you got do that it make have brain damage saw that’s why you not loud to do it stood they let Tommy fury do it ksi done most got him in mouth got some face shots all Tommy was doing is head shot that owner thing he hit was his head that cud kill some one saw ksi got in mouth tommy just owner hade head shots that was it just head nothfing not face it was head ksi got mouth and owner thing Tommy got was his head non stop every round it was just him punch in. Jj In head non stop
Your a bum ksi won he got robbed
Even in the clinch tommy won, idk what y'all saw.
It looked to me as if Tommy was in command, And it seems the judges saw it the same way.
Man the referee was horrible didn’t take any points of from ksi holding, cause those weren’t clinching nothing but holding and ksi performance was bad and is was cost him the fight, tommy was the only one boxing
Both awful. Should of been kissing all the holding that was going on.
Hard to box with some one who doesn’t know how to box…..
ALERT! TOMMY FURY DID NOT WIN!!
As a former KSI fan this was embarassing and painful to watch. Congrats Tommy Fury 👏
Surprised KSI didn't just try and spoon Tommy, he did enough cuddling. KSI can't box. They introduced him as a boxer, actor and musician. All these things take Talent and dedication to the craft. I'd never heard of KSI until last night and his post match interview showed how crass and immature he is. I watched it at an actor friends house and they were pissed off when it said he was also an actor....A wins a win. Well done Tommy.
Awful
Lost 😂
KSI was ROBBED
Absolutely rigged. The amount of times tommy was hitting ksi around the back of the head was atrocious. You claim to be a 'professional boxer' but take cheap shots and hit round the back of the head so you could have the upper hand. Its disgusting and pathetic performance.
Bro Tommy would have done better if Ksi stopped hugging him every 2 seconds
This fight was trash both of them just clashes and hugged! No boxing! Horrible horrible horrible.
Hope you do well bro and I know he didn’t come to fight but you need to improve a lot more if you want to take this sport seriously. Hopefully u knock Logan tf out
Lol, people saying KSI out here trying to hug while Fury is instantly locking KSI's left arm OMFG. HAVE YOUR EYES CHECKED. I'm even more baffled that this fight was close, that Fury's just on the level of these youtubers.
Bros shane from twd
tommy proud he went toe to toe wit a youtuber 😂 n fuck u yes u
Watched 5 mins just to see tommy throw minimum 5 illegal shots, what a waste of my life. If you dont believe this is rigged yall dumb
Ksi was definitely robbed cz hows tommy gonna train js to not throw any punches atleast jj threw some absolute robbed
its no fun watching non boxers try to fight. the skill of 2 people on the same level and weight class is what makes it entertaining. all ksi was doing was throwing the same punch the entire time and then hugging. glad i didn't watch this live. alot of ppl got robbed
Tommy fury's mma debut 🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations Tommy! You deserve this win a hundred percent! Even with the shitty way KSI fought and took the loss, you stayed calm and professional. Respect
"Boing" said zebadee...
KSI came to cuddle it seems.
Is that boxing or holding each other
They should have another fight, I reckon KSI is the only YouTuber boxer that could win, split decision ofc… they should set it for two years from now and fight at 187-189
Well Done. That was such a terrible fight. I could get in the ring with no training and knock KSI out in the 3rd round.  He’s a terrible boxer with a lot of money.
ksi won 4 rounds - 1,2,3,6
Today they fight , next month or next year they be a bestfriend . So intelligent
Ksi was wanting an easy way out that fight when Tommy tapped him ever so slightly on the back of his head.  Absolute gimp.
Thought this was boxing not hugging..
Ksi should've been DQd or given a stern warning for what he was doing
Ksi remind me of pineda when they fought🤣🤣
KSI GOT ROBBED JOHN FURY PAID THE JUDGES 😭
This is a clenching match  not boxing. Unfortunately KSI failed to demonstrate basic boxing pose. Just lunging forward through out. Where is the fun? Very tiring to watch.
I cant stand this Ksi. Hes not even boxing, this is autistic adhd npc brain clinching. I cant look at this dude, his appearance in the ring just pisses me off and how he box its just dissapointing. I cant explain how people can like him and his boxing
1% boxing  99% hugs 🫂
Controversial win against a YouTuber 😂 embarrassment to the fury name
Ksi robbed
Both shite in my opinion. Supposed to have grown up fighting and sparring with Tyson and can’t even knock out someone who jumped about and cuddled. Barely beat Jake Paul too… supposedly hates all the crossover boxing…. Then his Dad post fight was saying it’s the future and the crowd is there for it…
Ksi was getting hit on the head like crazy tbh I know he was clinching a lot this does not mean he was losing it was a crazy close match and y’all acting like tommy won easily it should have been a draw tbh they landed within 1 punches of each other and Tommy had way more warning and was playing a lot more dirty and ksi landed way more hard hitting hits
To be fair Fury had a massive weight advantage.
Good work Tommy you shown him, now time to destroy him in the rematch!!
Someone tell ksi this isnt a wrestling match ffs. Pathetic. I liked watching him box in previous fights but this was awful.
Lets go tommy. Fought with a guy who tried to make that a hugging competition
Jj clearly had a tactic. He knew tommy has a longer reach and wants to start in the middle of the ring, then run at him. So jj would go back at him to get in close and try to work right in tommys face. And clearly it got to tommy since he started punching him in the back of the head. I think the overall idea by jj was to make sure tommy can't just spam jabs at him and keep the fight in close quarters.   To be fair to him it worked in that sense
If Ksi don’t gtfo
They were both just appalling, terrible fight by a terrible boxer and a terrible whatever he is, this Ksi bloke is a joke, star jumps for 6 rounds. Crap.
fury's shorts win
KSI is making it out of nursery with this one.
Let's fucking go man, so proud
Κsi dodged 85% of Tommy's furry punches
Ksi was hugging the whole fight 😅
Ksi wants knocking out 😂😂
all the Tommy fury fan girls here are crazy you know who won.
Ref seems sus tbf
Very happy that you won. KSI needed to be humbled, and the tantrum he threw after the fight was embarrassing.
i really wanted ksi to win but i love how he is bold and accepted that he lost
This is the worst fight ive ever seen, ksi just bouncing then runs to him with left and right and clinching, thats all that happend. Congratulations on the win Tommy Fury. All love
KSI is wearing a skirt hahahaha
I’m glad I didn’t pay for this shit
This was Ksi fight no doubt about it he was robbed don’t care if people don’t agree with my statement but come on we all no more points need to be reduced from Tommy with the back head punche’s he was bear hugging Ksi and holding his left hand (arm) all time because he knew full well once that left had hit Tommy.tommy would off been f.cked Tommy made out it was Ksi hugging all the time, but we all know full well it was Tommy keeping that left hand from hitting him
I guess people paid to see a hugging contest 😀 clearly it's all about the 💰 pathetic and insulting for the sport and other athletes...
1:44 KSI hit Tommy in the back of the head first. The JJ starts complaining about being hit in the back of the head😂
ksi is trying way too hard to be connor mcgregor from the weigh in pose to the fighting style
Sad is that he was talking shit about you and when you won he almost cry😂
Poor fight from both sides
Boxing is such a sham spectacle these days.
lets be real it was a draw
welldone Tommy ksi was awful and so was the ref you got the W and thats the mane thing push on to the next and goodluck
KSI cannot box. He was also gassing from end of second round. Tommy is sooo much better, it’s a joke that people are saying KSI won. The punches KSI landed didn’t even land clean, Tommy didn’t look hurt for a second. KSI needs to learn to box before challenging a real boxer.
To many hugs in this fight
Yall are delusional man 🤣
Ksi should stick to dancing and hugging!! Maybe join strictly come dancing. Shit show of a fight. Mockery of boxing
you been getting treated like the little spoon buddy
Won't say anything against both of them but jj wasn't rob here 💀
This was a hugging competition, not boxing
Tommy why did you take this fight your a boxer why fight him embarrassing for both sides
If i am tommy i would titled this video "THE MOST EMBARRASSING FIGHT OF MY CAREER"
Congratulations bro for fucking ksi😂😂 he was trying to come closer to you and hugg u just to get fucked up by u.😂😂😂😂😂
Zero foot work zero head movement both sucks 🤣🤣😎
Tommy won because Ksi was just holding Tommy and he can’t box at all Tommy won in my eyes easy
Another bull 💩 writing fake fight just 4 money
tommy needed to be more patient and avoided the clinching more, shouldve let ksi move forward and catch him with an uppercut whenever he lunged forward with his head down which he did every 2 seconds
Our champion 🏆  well done son you done the egoistic sore loser 👏 👍
As long as you've been boxing, I know you were frustrated AF. If I took anything from the couple of years I trained as a teenager, is that I fucking HATED clinchers. It drives me crazy, that there are people saying Ksi got robbed. 😂😂
KSI = CLOWN
imagine being a pro boxer with a Fury last name, and barely beating a youtuber HHSHHSHAAHAA
JJ was out classing tommy in the clinch, every clinch exchange went his way that night. ROBBERY
Christ is King ! ✝️
wow.. its so annoying watching Ksi fight, just throwing wild punches without even seeing where he's throwing and after just lounging forward for the clinch.. hope he never robs the public ever again, ref should've warned and taken action after the 10th clinch on the first round
I love how Ksi was only trying to deduct points and then hold on
Bivol could take them both
Anyone with a non bias view could see that Tommy won that comfortably
so much hugging... just kiss already 😂
Ksi though it was a star jump contest 😂😂😂
Yes Tommy fury
Jump, overhand right, clinch, repeat. ksi ladies and gentlemen 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
It’s laughable seeing all the comments going at how ksi fought when HE WAS THE YOUTUBER! Have some shame a pro boxer couldn’t get him out after all that talking 🤣
Round 1 - 10/9 Tommy Round 2 - 10/8 KSI (point taken for back of head hits) Round 3 - 10/9 Tommy Round 4 - 10/9 Tommy Round 5 - 10/9 Tommy  Round 6 - 10/9 Tommy .. this was no robbery, KSI has one bouncy move and he only made good contact a few times, congrats Tommy!! 🍻
The fight was brutal and very uneventful… should have ended in a draw at best , neither of these guys won the fight
Tommy said he would stop ksi in round 1 if he is swinging, so some respect from tommy to ksi
So fury wants to be world champion? I see more chance in seeing McDonald’s go bankrupt… maybe he should take up YouTubing
Boxing now days is a joke YouTubers paying there way into the ring to fight 😂 who pays to watch this s**t
As a KSI subscriber this was disappointing, big up to tommy I ain’t mad at his win fair W
Jump around, jump around , jump up and get down (KSI) next ring walk song.
Bum fight
JJ was just playing around
KSI likes his cuddles and good ole hit and run tactic
Embarrassing from Tommy, supposed to have boxing as his main thing, but he’s a pathetic nepotism baby who’s never achieved anything, only relevant because of his family and girlfriend. Bro wants to be a world champion but can’t even legitimately beat a fifa player
look at them hugging 🥰🥰
You lost😂
Tommy’s a good looking guy, I can see why KSI just wants to hug him
Ksi casually doing star jumps and looking like a points fighter 😂😂
Watching KSI hop up and down like a sparkly rabbit is almost as good as eating cat shit with a knitting needle. Well done Tommy.
Has Tommy TNT FURY ever knocked out anyone?
KSI didn't train at all . I don't like the Paul Brothers but at least they look like they boxing.
Hugs boxing😂
Aw bless he just wants. Hug . Ksi 😂😂
From this angle this was a complete dominate win for Tommy, KSI is such a joke, bounce overhand right clinch repeat, and he thinks the judges are gonna reward that 😂😂
You did your best against this professional hugger
The people who said Ksi Clinching to tommy fury is delusional asf, KSI had full majority control of the ring and Tommy is the one clinching, headlocking and notice his hand always tryna hug/headlock JJ.  Ayoo watch in slowmo pls 😂 before comment
Good win Tommy, you worked hard for this man. All KSI did was jump around like a child and clench.
The guy in green isnt boxing
Congratulations on the win Tommy keep proving the gates wrong 💪
Too much clinching man this nigga ksi literally ruined it
No KSI Won or it should have been a draw he got robbedd
Well done Tommy
KSI runs 90% of the time and think he won
Tommy won but both ain't gonna do nothing in the sport
What an embarrasment to the sport. Pair of them. Done their fans dirty
well done tommy💪 his fighting style was pants were was his guard protect your chin at all times too cocky for me like that why the better man won it was not robbery neither✌🤟👍
Congrats on the well deserved win Tommy 🏆 👏
Robbed
Tommy the YouTuber slayer
From one Tommy to another my brother   Riley Viddal just won the English cruiserweight championship...a Fury would go after that.
ksi kept loosing balance due to his emotions
Well done Tommy, you won fair and square
Nice Job Tommy, can’t stand KSI
threw a hissy fit when he didnt get what he wanted 😂 also what is this cringe boxing style its not even boxing
Wow cant believe people payed for a sparring session.
People still don't accept that this is all scripted to make money
Tommy fury allowed a youtuber to give him such difficulty.  Tommy fury sucks lol
nice one Tommy brought the win home
I watched the fight by skipping through this video, 14 different parts… every time I saw ksi grabbing Tommy. Shame smh
Hug fest. Where the fight at
People saying ksi got robbed are you blind 🤣 he just wanted to give Tommy hugs
What made me laugh was ksi at the end saying "how many jabs did you land" the same amount as fucking you numbnut 🤣🤣
Bro ksi hug Tommy furry more time than I talked to girls wtf????
All Ksi did was clinch.. lame
ksi is tommy"s bitch..he went there to hug tommy
Problem child vs Ksi NEXT.
Fuck Ksi all he did was star jumps and trying have a cuddle he needs keep too playing on the football games 😂😂
KSI stick to YouTube pal, you looked a right knob out there doing your half arsed star jumps in your green skirt. Maybe kalee dancing is your calling.
You and everyone else knows you was lucky to get that win! It should have been a majority draw……. Respect to both fighter however for stepping in the ring
you lost brotha
Tommy is a great man but he lacked the foresight and intellect to consider the possibility of the fight going the distance which highlighted his true ability against a below average fighter/boxer in KSI. This was a poor move by his management team, especially considering his age and the stage he is at in his career.
10 OUT OF 10 FOR DANCING 😂
KSI the YouTube Hugger.
Throw a punch miss hug.. throw a punch miss hug.. they both did the same shit😂
watching this on the phone and since i don’t care to watch the full fight, i kept clicking skip forward 10 seconds. All i saw was clinching..
lol this pro boxer got a draw with a YouTuber that's been boxing for 4 years. where's the knock out Tommy? honestly you hate on influencer boxing, but with your skills you should stay in this scene at least then you can make some money.
Know you would win no pikeys getting done in round here mush
2 wannabee's maximising their talent lmfao!!!  the only talent either has is being able to manipulate morons into buying into this circus.
Most boring fight ever, they only hugging eachother
all i know is that neither guys are real boxers. i'm glad tommy isn't trying to be tyson, he's an influencer boxer! always has been
Ksi u belend
Ksi taught he could win just by bouncing around like a ballerina and spaming the right and then clinching all the time.
Ksi is arrogant and one day it will overcome him and he will lose
Ngl I thought KSI won because I was caught up in the spectacle of the event but after watching it again I remember this was a "boxing fight" KSI clinched a total of 72x not sure why the ref didn't deduct a point for it either. Tommy pushed the fight, had ring generalship and was landing the better shots.
Ksi can't fight
people really pay for this? 😂
Bro you are mentally ill if you actually think you won
Robbery Ksi won and furry always tried to cleanse
I feel like because he his a pro boxer so he just score few point over ksi  Ksi had this fight
This is the most clinches ive ever seen in a boxing fight💀
Nobody got robbed Tommy deserve to win that ksi should stick with making YouTube videos and leave the boxing to the professionals like Tommy
KSI moves like taekwondo man
What a pair of women
KSI was robbed so hard it was a draw atleast
Ksi got robbed
Rematch coming, with the legacy tommy has i dont see john or tyson letting him live down a score card ending.
As Tommy who suppose to be a boxer who can't knock out these YouTube guys I think k he needs to give boxing up.
They robbed bro so bad
KSI was dreaming from the start… all the smack talk for nothing lil bitch… @jon fury could have taken him..
Lets get it tommy 😃
Tommy sucka man can’t even beat some YouTuber
Ksi looks dumb not keeping his hands up
Omg is this boxing or what?  Maybe these guys should try acting or some show wrestling. Anyway it is obvious that boxing ain't one of their superiority.  Two hugging dancers who are saying they are boxers but in cage we see only dancing makabers. One of the worst "boxing" rounds i've ever seen anyway.  Like nowdays is common for these social media people, there is too much talk and selfies. LOL🫣
Ksi fans wont stop crying TOM DESERVED THE  W!
KSI made Fury look like an amateur..  KSI bullied him in the clinch .. KSI clearly won this fight .. ROBBED
Anyone who knows boxing or who knows how to box can clearly see ksi not got a clue he as very bad head position when he going in constantly twist his head and as for the one bomb wonder does he think he his wilder ksi can not box his way out of a paper bag lol but good win for tommy up the fury's onwards and upwards
Tommy is the deserved winner. Ksi was just doing jumping jacks and clinching for the whole fight!
We now live in a world where people pay to watch grown men who make a living off “YouTube” fight and then call it “pro boxing” 🤦‍♂️ I wish people would stop supporting this trash. It’s a disgrace to the actual pros who have been taking damage all their life to perfect the craft and look good doing it
If that performance is what you call a pro boxer than i think you should be disappointed mate that a youtuber was on par with you if not better , this is your level and he showed you 😀, congratulations on the win 💪🎉
Congratulations 🎊 👏
lord ksi has won dont get over ur self
Was KSI on a bouncing castle
Let’s goooo Tommy! Congrats man!
Congrats on the win, Tommy! Check the scorecards, it was actually unanimous for you, but the judge that had you tied added up the rounds wrong for KSI (10, 10, 9, 9, 9, 9, for 57, when it should be 56). Hope amazing things are in store for you - if there aren't, make them happen!
Does nobody see how much this ref protected JJ
this is why ksi only fights 6 rounds, if he doesn’t get that first round KO he doesn’t know what to do.
What’s happening with the boxing federation? They bring a amateur like ksi to fight a pro, hilarious! I don’t know why Tommy is fighting a shite fighter like dat😏 jokers!
Kept shouting JAB all night. 😂 My missus thought I was mad.
Pro boxer 😂 tommy your not a pro boxer you won bye a point schame 😂😂😂
Good on you Tommy. Won fair and square. 💪⭐️
Ksi permanently clinching how the fuck are you meant to fight like that. Sooooo bad
Alls i can see ksi doing is dancing
Ksi now owns the world record for star jumps in a boxing match well done 😂😂😂
We love you Tommy thank god u put that egomaniac in his place been waiting for this for so long
Ksi was more worried about grabbing than he was about landing a punch. Hard to have a boxing match with someone who didn't come to box.
Ksi robbed tommy’s winning moment by being a sore looser
KSI is horrible, dance around throw a punch then clinch at first  sign of danger. Showboat then cry, accept defeat and please retire from "boxing" your horrible
I like both of you's but I've just watched it back & I really thought it was a draw plus you had a point deducted 🤷‍♀️  Are you going to rematch KSI? Well done though 👏
Thank u for finally humbling him
Straight to the point...KSI can't box... Dances, swings and was that scared he just grabbed and held on.... Bet he is even scared of wet paper bags...
that's a loss that
Ref was bias in the clinches as soon as Tommy hit ksi he breaks
Congrats! To you Tommy a real stand up boxer who came to fight ..KSI came to clown and do jumping jacks and hold you he knew he couldn't beat you
Ksi amd Dillon shouldnt be in ring  mo offtnstaybto you tube
Nah, KSI did boxing dirty, You won, Tommy
Tommy won that fight flat out. Much respect for him.💯📈⬆️🔥
KSI hugging you like you are his dad or some shit. Reminds me, his dad also beat the shit out of him.
KSI  LOOKED LIKE A DUMB SWINGER 😂🎉
Tommy ain’t no pro boxer if he went the distance with 2 YouTubers, he’s pretty much the same level as them, average at best and tbh should have been a draw
I read people saying tommy only landed x number of punches and somehow won. You need context on this one. Ksi does not belong boxing. Antics then clinch repeatedly. He can't stand and box.
Next, KSI go UFC😂
Do you think Ksi got confused and thought he was in a dance off lol
Is this even boxing 😂
That is not how to box ksi 😂😂
Always rooting for you
There was not one exchange that didn’t end with Ksi clinching. No way he trained half a year and did this
Woooo goooo Tommy 🎉
I hope ur family makes you stop boxing and makes you change ur last name bc Ksi won that and ur so bad
a whole lot of hugging going on reminded me of bounce and bop ksi not a boxer hes a tree hugger
ksi stance is absolute ridiculous so stupid looked like he was doing jumping jacks id knock his fucking head off in two minuets man these boxers now a days just aren't hungry anof and tommy should of knocked him out show them the fucking fight of there life give me a spot on misfits card soft fights they are id guarantee a knock out.
You lost that fight 100% you was dirty in this fight you are meant to be a professional
Hopefully people will now see ksi is not a good fighter which ive been saying since the first fight
what a bunch of yes men in thiws comment section hahaha i tought tommy was gonna win and was pretty sure about it but this was not a win for him first of how the judges made the scores where off wich in itself is so wierd they gave away the score card after the fight wiich is just not how its done ksi did fewer punches then tommy and still hit 1 less punch wich says alot about ksi being more accurate then tommy, tommy barely hit any jabs wich is so bad for him, tommy fought worse then he did jake wich his family members admitted themself in interviews after the fight 90 % of the people close ring side who had there money on tommy still tought ksi won when interviewed after even eubanks jr was confused. no mather what anyone in this comment section says tommy fury skill wise should have destroyed KSI but barely made it out with a win thats the most wierd win ive ever seen in boxin history even the score card was scribbled and according to factuals the judges changed the score card on round 2 during round 6 this is a loss for tommy in my eyes and many others i dont care if you yes men hjere wont admitt it but you still have to aceppt that this was the worst performance tommy has ever done in his career and keep in mind his worst performance against KSI as tommy himself said "your just a youtuber" he almost lost to a youtuber and in post interview he says hes proud of his performance man that performance is not it tommy how could you do worse against a youtuber then youve ever done any of your professional fights earlier embarassing im a huge boxing fan and been following boxing for years and this is not it m8 and to be honest you said in a post interview that your the domi9nion now that you choose what happens in this influencer boxing scene but in fact you dont they still have the lead and the means if jake and ksi decide to go to to toe your out for good and at this point im pretty content with that cause after that performance and even the performance against jake id say they dont need you they both showed they can easily go toe to toe with a professional boxer and still walk the walk so id say bye tommy it was fun but its kinda over.
Tommy won but he shouldnof stepped back and swung instead of pushing forward for ksi to get his wild throw and clinch
Tomy win Clear Your The Win in This Match Your Win All Round. Ksi doing only Jumping & hugging No Puch No Body Shot but Your is you have Puch & Body shot Tomy is Win Sure 👍👌🎉❤ Good Job Jack Family & KSI Family is only YouTuber not boxer Tomy win
Ksi hit the back of tommys head multiple times lmao
ksi cant fkng stop hugging holy
Tommy Fury is a future champion, hardworking real boxer. I'm an ufc fan, but you've gained a new supporter yesterday. I don't think ksi respects boxing at all
Typical ksi fight … lots of hugging 😂
If the fight was longer ksi wouldn't of been able to do it
I don’t get why ksi keeps putting on shows he’s so trash it’s embarrassing 😂😂😂😂you can’t fight someone doing star jumps and hugging the whole fight I’m not even mad at Tommy for not getting the knockout because ksi wouldn’t even engage 🤦🏿‍♂️🤣
anybody else watching it  think that KSI actually won? Then thinking about  Tommy deserved the win
well done on the win he looks like a awkward fucker to box do me a favour and the next fight you get show then what real fucking hunger is because we all have it in us ksi is a soft fight and should of knocked him out give me a spot on misfits soft fights.
Ksi pulling a penida the entire fight 😂😂
W tommy  Nobody got robbed . Tommy deserved to win and thank you for shutting these clowns up 🙏
What was the ref doingg. Bruh the ref allowed all this he was responsible
Nice one❤ tommy
Wtf where’s the end!? Who won? I’m hoping Tommy but who actually won?
NEVER watching influencer boxing again even if can call it boxing who would of thought we'd get scammed by scammers.!
Ksi fights like a schoolkid lool
Broo this ref sucks so bad he was sleeping. Clinches took wayy too longg, he forgot grappling isnt boxing.
im sorry but ksi was shocking .what a sore looser jumping around with his hands down the whole time I'm gutted I paid to watch it but glad tommy won
Ksi must’ve been going through it all he wanted was a long hug
0:53 Look at how much he missed by lol. That's meant to be his bread and butter shot. He doesn't even set it up properly, there's no jab before it either, just star jumps. It's mad how he thinks he deserved more than loss. In his own little head, he probably thinks he's won that, based off the point deduction. Imagine lving off a point deduction, when you're that successful in life.... That's how desperate he was to win, plus his corner aswell was behaving the same. Encouraging the same tactics, looking for Tommy to lose more points. Desperation. KSI needs to sack his trainers anyways, get someone else in, he literally hasn't improved since Logan Paul.
All KSI do is left jab and then he try to strike with right cross all fight he does this what a jerk broo
Fair play man you’re a true pro boxer 👏
JJ won. Briefcase chest lost
Statistically he threw less and landed more than Tommy, so that is a shot in the dark my friend
Robbery
I feel like he keeps clinching because once the  combinations from tommy start coming. He cant just weave and dodge it off
the thing I disliked the most is the fact that jj said he would ko you in 4 rounds. But the fight went the distance. You both had more to show it should have been 8 rounds.
That’s a draw.
Honestly mate, just retire from pro boxing, you're not cut out for it, if you were you wouldn't be fighting youtubers who never "started boxing since they were 6". You controversially, barely beat KSI. This game isn't cut out for you.
Hugs hugs and hugs fight 😂😂 ksi you a clincher  😂😂 come on   little batch that you are ,, trying to go toe to toe with a fury 😂😂😂😂
Why is KSI emoting the whole time, bro is doing the luddy and orange justice i think
ksi is not a boxer this fight was just like Logan vs may weather ski clinched way too hard making it difficult for Tommy to box , imagine someone hugging you all the time in the fight it would be very difficult to fight , it was a fair decision and how can you even say its robbed when event was created by ksi . how can you get robbed in your own event .
2:01 That kid lmao
Yo
All i can take from this rubbish is Tommy Fury’s reputation as a professional boxer has gone down yet again.
KSI worlds most aggresive hugger... Ksi throws 1 punch and dives in for the hug, no shit Fury couldn't throw that many punches...  The ref should not allow such nonsense, but ofc it's rigged for KSI 6 rounds and all 💤
Ksi kept on clinching because Tommy was putting it on him he was scared shitless of the combos and kept hugging he should have had a point decucted so ksi fought like a pussy
I mean if ksi wasn’t doing star jumps every 2 seconds and swung wildly and actually engaged in a fight it wouldn’t have been close at all.
u robbed ksi   tyson and your dad threatend the judges
Mr.Robbery Congratulations On Wining
I love u Tommy I know u won I pray for you and your the king I love u bro 🔝🔝🖤
this is pathetique lots of trash clowns stepping into the ring latly RIP Boxing.
VIDDAL WILL DROP U IN A ROUND STAY AWAY FROM PROFESSIONAL BOXING STICK TO INFLUENCERS
Delusion is thinking KSI won. Like... What the hell am I even watching? 😂
Well done m8, KSI was hard to box with yhe jumping n hugging 😂😂
Atta boy Tommy, everyone will say things but fighting someone who doesn’t want to box can be tough. You did what you had to do to win.
Well done champ. KSI thought this was a jumping contest
Tommy fake fury cant even put down 2 youtubers. Stick to weightlifting and leave the fighting to you big brother. Calling KSI a bum haha he makes you look skint you Dosser
KSI sucks at boxing Jake Paul and Tommy fury better but Jake Paul better than Tommy fury
robbery
One uppar cut Tommy, thats all you needed but anyways win is a win.
This should've been a draw IMO but a win is a win so accept it with all the effort and hard work you've done anyway it's a great fight👍👍
ksi looks ridiculous, he looks like a character out of the game, angry birds, kept flapping his fucking arms about. #bellend
Tommy is the worse boxer I ever seen as he been in boxing history since young age he should be a champion buy now. He can’t beat up a YouTuber which start boxing not long a go
You lost Kid
you clearly won he didn't even wanna box he just throws one shot then clinches to waste time i see why he didn't wanna go 8 rds and the judges he bought knew you won
Clinching, holding or grappling is illegal in boxing! So according to the Queensbury rules, there is no proper way to clinch.
Tommy ur awful lad, pure robbery, rigged asf n ur smacking my guy in back of head ur a cheap shot, not no professional boxer in my eyes
All ksi was doing was jumping around hugging Tommy wtf
Embarrassing from both fighters
Ksi make ur own brand called hug
Well done Tommy 👏🏾
KSI has absolutely no right to be boxing. He has zero skill. And the fact Tommy wasn’t able to completely dismantle him proves he doesn’t have it either. Tommy looks like a boxer and has technique but is lacking precision and power.
ksi is delusional, not real fighter
Fury's improving so fast he's well on his way for a world title belt.
KSI landed less and threw less - you won fair and square Tommy 🥊
So much talk by KSI, just to end up clinching during every exchange. After 3rd round, bro was just clinching and bouncing in his starfish stance.
KSI: The Night Hugger
if anyone genuinely watches boxing for a while will know that Tommy won that fight I wasn’t clearly but still pulled the w ksi was clinching for his life in the last 4-5 rounds
Congratulations Tommy
KSI such a sore loser. Go and have a good cry pal. The only reason it was close is because it was 6 rounds anymore and you would of been smashed. Make the rematch 10 rounds.
Garbage. Fight some actual boxers make these crossover fools earn the opportunity to fight you again.
how can a professional boxer show his talent against such an inexperienced awkward fighter…? the maths ain’t mathing!! but good on Tommy for bringing the entertainment and making money for his family whilst putting his reputation on the line he’s trying to build
KSI the tree hugger haha
6 rounds is too short to deal with this KSI's tactic. He just tries to land a one shot and then runs into a clinch. If there was more rounds Fury would've been able to take the win in a much more distinct manner where no one could doubt it. Respect to Fury
Robbed
"A decision against a youtuber is not a win for me" - tommy
Ksi made this fight really boring tbh, the clinching got annoying at one point
bro you can't knock out a youtuber
Ksi were playing jumping jack and flapping his arms the entire fight and oh not forgetting hugging tommy 😂
Robber 🤡
18:26 Ksi hitting tommy's head first and then complaining when he does it to him lmao
Ksi is the most embarrassing “fighter” I’ve ever seen. How can he say he got robbed when every single exchange he made was a clinch. He landed two good shots the whole fight. Tommy won
No boxing happens . . Its huging all night
MANCHESTAAAA
At first thought he edged it watching it back draw. Ksi was anti-boxing rounds 3-6
Let's go tommy every single fight you look in better shape than the last 1 keep it up champ
Congratulations Tommy
Tommy should be crying or he's delusional as he's a huge shame on boxing for being close to be beaten by a YouTuber. "I grew up with boxing", how embarrassing. He's the brother of the best boxer of our generation and this is what he comes with? Look KSI has no right to be upset but Tom has no right to be happy or not at least utterly embarrassed and should retire immediately.
ROBBERY
love u fury
Fair play to Tommy
KSI landed more shots and even the score cards said he won and everyone watching the fight, the judges must’ve been absolutely retarded
Well done Tommy a real fighter ❤wtf was he even wearing 😂
You lost 😂
If this was a 8 round fight, you would have won more clearly. Accept the rematch only if this clown agrees to 8 rounds 🥊
Man, ksi launched too many overhand power punches, credit to tommy reading and ducking all of them. It's really not that easy fight even for professionals against this unorthodox style and with all the pressure, credit to tommy! Well deserved win!
Tommy fury is the worst boxer i have seen
These fights this one and danis-paul all should have been a lot better in UFC...
Tommy I respect u but you know damn well Ksi won that
LETS GO TOMMY!
Round of applause for Logan, taking a win n giving Danis a peice of his own medicine
KSI won get ready for the appeal to become into a draw or win for ksi
sad that he did not put KSI in wheelchair
You're a class act Tommy. Much love from Australia.
KSI won. Appeal coming to overturn the wrong scoring.
Fight was pissing me off -ref not separating them sooner -ksi hitting when Tommy would raise his hands up to signal he’s not clinch fighting anymore since it was like the 70th time they clinched -the commentators glazing the fuck outta ksi,saying it could be a draw or a win for either fighters,then when the results were said,bitching about it -ksi fighting like Anthony fucking Taylor making the entire fight boring,ducking all the way to suck Tommy’s nuts and getting into the clinch because of it
what fans ? where ?
Can we draw a line in the sand now.  Tommy Fury isn't a boxer so stop using him to give these events credibility.  By all means have these fighting cabaret evenings with midgets and drag queens and whatever you like. It's a wonderful evening of entertainment where YouTubers and social media stars and other curios can fight each other.   But stop trying to give it credibility by pretending it's a boxer vs a YouTuber. It's not. It's love Island vs a YouTuber.   Good luck to everybody making a lot of money from these events but the time to stop calling them crossover events is now. They are not crossover. They are just entertainment and always were.   If the event was more honest and just presented itself as an evening of great novice fight entertainment I would have been more likely to settle down with a beer and paid for the event and watched it with my misses having a laugh.  As a boxing fan primarily it's hard to do this when the entire thing is charading as boxer vs YouTuber.   Tommy Fury was marketed spectacularly with a few so-called professional bouts then strategically put into love Island and then leveraged to make millions off of that profile building and that pretty face. The Fury family know how to make money and they have made money out of Tommy brilliantly. But he isn't a boxer. If he was they would not have put him into love Island in the first place.   Enough now.
Bro you aint got no fans LOL
Glad KSI got humbled. He can’t even fight properly
ur done bro you lost to youtuber delete this video
I just wanna say here that ksi was not robbed, mfer still lost after tommy fury got a bullshit point taken from him, this was a piss poor display of Tommy’s abilities. Considering if there was another week of camp, and ksi wasn’t running like a chicken, tommy would’ve got the knock out
Well Done Lad 💯🙏🏽🫶🏽
Enjoy rotting in hell bro
yay Tommy!
Jesus hates you Tommy
It will be overturned as a draw
This is trash bro delete immediately
For sure never watching another Tommy fight ever again. This guy is terrible and gets -1 for 5 back of the head shots. Biased judges trash home manchester wants to keep their ego. Stay trash Tommy you are dogwater bro u lost to a youtuber.
Fury claims he's the pro boxer and only just about beat him. Fury should leave this game he has nowhere to go from here,ksi and jade Paul,fury done
Congrats
Tommy won because he has fury in his name, fight me
Well done fella! Not the knock out we all wanted to see but the win was all we could ask for.
hahahaha you almost got beat by a youtube so bad tommy ksi real winner here
Good work my guy 🔥💪😤
You Lost And The World Knows This. You Call Yourself A Pro Lmao 🤣🤣
Well done Tommy Gun 🥊
robbery, you didnt win that
ksi won
Congratulations Tommy!! <3
Well done Tommy! Your the best
🤼‍♂️🫂
U deserved
Hey good job, you won that well deserve for the better boxer. But, you still have improvements, I'm looking forward in supporting you again.
Ksi got robbed
Congrats Tommy you deserved it ❤❤
Tommy won but it was it was an embarassing performance from a pro boxer that’s been doing it all his life. To go the distance with two youtubers who he’s got a huge size advantage on is pretty embarassing.
Congratulations Tommy our champ 💪🏽
Ksi came for hug and jump 😂
KSI thought the combinations of Star Jumbs,air punching and hugging Tommy for the hugs he missed out from his father could win him a boxing match.  But to be fair Tommy looks horrible in that ring too. u have to step up the game Mate.
he carnt  hide that forhead  now 😎
Tommy lost rigged fight
Ksi did not win he lost and that's that
Ksi got robbed even the score cards reveal that
Tommy says ksi is just a YouTuber but yet Tommy uploads more than ksi does on his main channel 😂
You lost , Ksi made you look bad. People need to rethink this fight how is it KSI's fault for clinching, if anything Tommy a pro boxer did barely any thing
What's with the gay star jumps
Please rematch in your hometown again
People can have points deducted for excessive clinching from what I’ve read. I think considering that there was a clinch every ten seconds, there was definitely reason to enact such a penalty. It must have been hard to build momentum with that sort of thing happening…you should fight the winner of KSI v Jake Paul if you do want to go again.
Fury an absolute waster
Wtf was this man you shouldn’t been knock that hugger down
Worst fight i’ve ever seen but atleast you beat him
Embarrassing to call yourself a real pro, please just admit it. Imagine Vidal Riley in there you wouldn’t last 3 rounds
There was no winner. Only lovers who paid to watch this sh*t show
Well done Tommy! I thought it’d be a draw but it wasn’t, someone had to win and the better man did👑enjoy this W and don’t listen to the geeks who just watch misfits boxing🤣I do like Ksi but hopefully this’ll humble him a bit🥊
Very very close fight, but tommy clear as day won that, no idea what ksi was thinking ref should have taken away points for anti boxing ksi even hit tommy on the back of the head, tommy if you re match him dont do it with misfits as its all one sided
Bro said before if he doesn’t knock him out it’s a loss but then cried when I got a decision in happiness
how do people think tommy won hahahahahahaha ksi clearly won rnd 1, 2 & 6 and won 57-56 KSI
You couldn’t jab. Jj landed more jabs. You didn’t throw any right hands. Jj rocked you with a couple
Lets be real here. It was a draw
Ksi dodged all of your punches lol. Could hardly beat an amateur
Good Job Tommy fury
W Tommy
Congrats 🎉Tommy, but you can’t be proud of that performance you hit him back of his head lots of times and you got point deduction so how does that makes sense?
The two main fights were a disgrace to boxing and an insult to the people who payed good money to see a fight.
You clearly lost
There was zero integrity from JJ, stark contrast in maturity and skill on display - congrats big yin.
WE LOVE YOU TOMMY
Thank you Tommy your a class act my friend  Forget about that HUGGER
U deserved that win Tommy well done !!! Love u and ur family all of u keep doing what u are doing ❤
You lost m8
Tommy Fury, your career is only just beginning, so I have made a vow to watch all your fights as my favourite boxer
Legend, doing the family name proud❤
Ksi is a fraud he's holding all the time stood bouncing like he's in a street fight Tommy won that all day was it a great clean fight no take the rematch and show the class that u have 🎉
ksi was hugging tommy more in a boxing match than someone in his whole life
Tommy has to fight these level of fights in all honesty.
❤️❤️💪
Ksi is movin like swarmz
Congratulations on the win Tommy ❤! Let me be honest I was shocked by the judges decision to give you the win but you have put KSI back into reality! Please don't rematch Jake Paul it's not worth it bro!
KSI WON THIS A RIGGED ROBBERY GTFO OUTTA HERE 😂
KSI picking snowangels over snowballs
Predicted the fight from day one the exact method of victory and the victor, was there last night n you smashed it🔥
Don't listen to the ksi fanboys you won that fight king 👑
Well deserved Tommy! KSI is cringey and embarrassing, guy honestly thought he won the fight by hugging all day. The guy was trying to survive and not fight, there's even footage of his coach giving him advice/tips in one of the rounds to keep clinching. No skills what so ever, what happened to him saying he's going to stand in the middle in the ring and fight Tommy lol? if I were his fans I would be pissed off that he went in there and made the fight boring. The delusional kid got humbled, the good person always wins in the end. Good defeats ego, time for KSI to check his.
Yes Tommy 🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations Tommy I'm glad you won. It's a shame he was hugging you so much I think he needs a teddy bear lol
Fully deserved
We love ya Tommy ❤❤❤
Look at ksi he’s hugging Tommy every 5 seconds and referee did nothing 2 points should’ve been deducted at least
KSI clearly lost this fight by miles!!!! Why is he complaining like the ref can fight for him!? Lol what a pussy.! Tommy Fury God Bless you and the family and big Congrats on another good fight. Obviously it wasnt a great one only because your opponent was a chicken. None the less Im sending you and the family lots of Love from New Zealand.
I just dk how u can play so dumb😂 both you and John know you lost
Tommy deserves the win anyway over this clown he’s a real man and shows that daily JJ is a joke he showed up to dancing class tonight won most hugged in boxing that’s it
KSI ROBBED! I don’t like either of you particularly but u can’t say u won, it will get overturned. You’ve embarrassed yourself n your name
Yea defiantly thought you won or it was gonna be a draw because of point deduction but cmon lad how you celebrating like you win the lottery when you beat 2 YouTubers lol 😂 any amateur boxer at the local gym would tear up Jake or ksi
I knew you were going to win it goes to show that nobody can be good at everything. KSI needs to focus on putting that clown make up and entertaining his fans with his ridculous youtube videos he is not made for the boxing world.
Ksi thought it was hugging and dancing competition he didn’t come to fight embarrassing.
You’re a legend Tommy. For you to thank Jesus Christ first on your post fight interview before saying or doing anything else straight after the fight, you earned my respect even more. You are a humble fighter and had a well deserved win. Just became a fan. Hope you best for the future. God bless you🙏🏽
well done tommy. ksi was an absolute joke man
Tommy do yourself a favor moving forward and stop accepting 6 round fights  Your the pro boxer, take it to atleast 8-10   You did well considering KSI is an awkward "fighter" who doesnt want to actually engage in the fight
I really would like to see Tommy a world champion.   Please get better man. You're supposed to be way above these guys. Not wining by 1 point.
You are the real one tommy! All these ksi fans saying it was robber y is just bullshit. You can fight mcgregor and next fight with the winner  of ksi and jake.
Congratulations Tommy , as a God Jesus Christ believer myself , have you given 10% of your winnings to God and the church ? You ought to to thank God for giving you the victory etc
You did us proud Tommy, well done!!!
Dont mind ksi but he’s a cheeky bastard saying he won, well done Tommy
hug and rabit punch ribs
Ye made a fortune bud but head back to the big leagues now, congrats on the win
W
seems like a close fight,like a draw ,but the fight was terrible shit,shit performance by both of them,grabbing each other evevy round
The difference is Tommy came there to box and push KSI on the backfoot. KSI came there to do jumping jacks and rush to a clinch immediately in every exchange.  It was clear as a day that bum didn't come to fight but just swing recklessly acting like a starfish in the ring.  Tommy is a legend ♥️♥️
Good job, Tommy! Didn't doubt you for a second!
1:43 ksi scaired
Well deserved win, KSI was bouncing around and hugging the whole time. There's only so much you can do against an opponent who doesn't want to fight properly.
Huge congratulations 🎉Tommy
That ref was completely there for ksi and he still didnt win well done tommy.x
Deserved win, step away from all this shite now, Jesus Christ on your side always 🙏🏻
bro you didnt win JJ got robbed and why you beat a YOUTUBER?
I never disliked KSI. But I expected him to at least try to box. That was not OK, and during the fight, wich I saw last nigt, I said to my self; Damn, talk to KSI, damn ref. Any other promotion..  Put a number of clinches in the contract next time. :P   You deserved to win. The few times he actually did something else than "wrestle", you seemed ready, and on a counter. F'** numbers. KSI made this kind of a joke, not contesting, and engaging.   I would love to see you fight someone who can actually box, so we can see, and proof what you're made of. I believe in you.   Bon apatite.
🐐
You are the king of boxing Tommy u have shown and proven all of us you're a absolute machine.Your work ethic is fucking fire i freaking love u dude one day i hope i meet u in person. Everytime i see u it just motivates me. I support u 100% love from Sri lanka 🇱🇰
Fucking Good Job Tommy you Won
KSI BEAT YOU AND YOU KNOW IT
YOU LOST LITTLE BRO
You said he's a youtuber and you will knock him out ( tyson is the only real boxer in the family )
Definitely wasn't your win, robbed off of KSI. Everyone knows it. Even your brother was shocked at the results
You lost lil bro
Congratulations Tommy you earned that victory 🎉❤
Ksi is a hugger
Jake paul would knock ksi out, Tommy wanted to box ksi wanted to play star jumps
Jake paul would knock ksi out, Tommy wanted to box ksi wanted to play star jumps
Jake paul would knock ksi out, Tommy wanted to box ksi wanted to play star jumps
Tommy should hire someone to go on his account and block all those fangirls of ksi
Robbery
Jake paul would knock ksi out, Tommy wanted to box ksi wanted to play star jumps
vs jake next
ggs
If you listen to jj corner between rounds.. his coach was telling him to make you hit the back of his head, and complain to judges... he was telling ksi to do it
Skippy just wanted to cuddle Tommy
Congrats my man!
Yes Tommy congratulations 🔥🔥
Smashed it geeza. Well done 🎉
tommy should be embarrassed with his performance, awful boxer and he wants to be a world champion he says. He's not a boxer hes molly maes servant
Congrats Tommy 💪🏼
You have to do a rematch worse boxer
Well done Tommy 🎉
Pushihed him back the whole fight and KSI just ran and hugged
LETS GOOOO CONGRATS TOMMY
nicely done
i dont know if it was a robbery or not but I for a fact know, that tommy didn't lose
you should be embarrased
Well done tommy,🥵
you are amazing tommy. thank you for shutting ksi up once and for all. u deserve the win BOSS
So glad you won! Just some constructive criticism, I will say the biggest issue I saw you did overcrowd yourself, meaning you could not get off full extension shots, which was compounded when facing someone like KSI who is moving on the inside really quick, it gives you so little time to land a punch as he is also moving towards the inside. It makes sense why you developed this habit when all your family has longer reaches than yourself, that you'd go to the inside, but when fighting guys with shorter reaches, it just leads to overcrowding and those back of the head shots, which would be legitimate hooks when fighting someone with a 84 - 85 inch reach, however are not when it's someone who's reach is in 70s. Which annoyingly lead to the point deduction, which was a bit unfair as KSI was doing back of the head punches, but didn't get poitns deducted.
Congratulations tommy, the right one won and the best man on the night, ksi wtf 🥊💣
Congratulations Tommy! Winning against the hugging world champion KSI was not an easy task I'll say that
Should be embarrassed mate ksi went toe to toe with you and was robbed of a win just because of who you are you’re a disgrace
Ksi should never be allowed to box again, just wanted to hug all night, he's an embarrassment to fighting, well done for trying to box tommy, up the gypsies! !!!!!
Congrats tommy
Best man out there deserved that win by Farr ❤❤
you know damn well you didn't win the fight
This was an absolute robbery KSI landed and threw harder punches and all Tommy did was through a jab that either KSI dodged or it slid off his face and missed. The only good punch tommy landed was the right hook that didn’t do anything. Everyone knows KSI won speed knows it logan knows it and even Tommys brother Tyson did you see his face after he won he sure well knows it.
Well done Tommy not the best performance as a fan mate but you won fair and square onwards and upwards now leave these ballerinas alone 😂
Congratulations Tommy what was Ksi doing 😂
Ksi was ridiculous. As your father said, his style would make a good boxer trying to fight him look bad. You won. He tried to make it a wrestling match.
you thief, even tyson knew you hadn't won
The scorecard was incorrect
LETS FUCKING GO TOMMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Legend mate, always believed G. Your legacy continues and you didn’t even have to get it tattooed on ya 😂
Ksi beat this guy who claims to be a professional boxer
Well done Tommy 🎉
WINNNER!! So happy for you! 🎉🏆🥊🥊
Congratulations Tommy for W🔝🔝🔝
People are delusional saying it was a robbery... u won round 2, so the point didnt matter... and then you won round 3-6..
Tommy deserves to win. He is a man of God and has masculine values. Great win!
Ksi throwed very few punches and kept clinching and people think he won 😂!
Well done Tommy!! Watched the full thing yesterday night ❤
Ksi beat you don't talk shit
I love you tommy fury
Glad you won that but was hard to watch him jump about like a fool
Congrats Tommy You deserve the VICTORY!!!
