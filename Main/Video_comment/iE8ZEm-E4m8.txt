STOP
rtyuio
man city go
Seeing City with the European Cup just feels wrong. Artificial club
Sevilla had the better chances, unlucky to lose this one.
I love that they showed the whole shootout
why show picture of winner in thumbnail. seems wrong
Rse
Sevilla's got some pretty girls. Just saying..
3:21
Could’ve been mourinho vs pep like the good ol days, wish it could’ve happened!!
Well done City!  Sevilla have a lot of quality and potential Premier Leaguers.  On the last penalty it looked like Eddy was about to do a Grobbelaar.
For some reason it's quite hard to follow the ball.
Dang it! As a Man U fan I really wanted Sevilla to win
City didn’t deserve the win at all. They really are nothing with Kevin, Silva and Gundo. Didn’t see them create one clear chance
Is KDB the only guy who knows how to properly place the ball to Haaland?
I find this so scripted, how tf you miss a penalty that bad with goalie going the other way
Grealish’s pk man😮
I hope ElNasiry can work on scoring with his feet as much as he does with his head. He can be one of the best strikers.
En-Nesyri should've really had Sevilla out of sight with that second chance. congrats to Man City
Hala and cannot be ronaldo in UCL
Haaland just loves the bottom corner of the goal. Wish he slams more top bins.
Repent of your sins and trust in Jesus Christ or hell awaits you
I feel like BONO Sevilla gk is always smiling
Sevilla could have won with a hat trick 😮‍💨
Alvarez has completed football at 23 🎉
people will sing Haalands name all day and rightfully so, but games like this show just how crucial KDB is to this whole team going forward, how KDB isnt up for player of the year is crazy to me, without him city win nothing, maybe just the fa cup
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

We can’t be stopped
does de bruyne get this counted on his record as a super cup winner or nah?
whats bono smiling about
ederson playing mind games. he's dope. talking to all his bros...  epic.
City is gathering quite the collection of hardware 😊❤ man city 4 life win lose or draw blue moon baby
love it
Hi
Hello there, I just wanted to share that Jesus Christ loves you and died for your sins so that you can have a relationship with God the father and be restored. If you want a relationship with God all you have to do is confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is lord and that He died for you! And turn to him in repentance. You don’t have to live life on your own anymore! God will change your life forever, I promise there is hope! He did it for me! There is a God and I am His witness. The choice is yours, have a great day :) God loves you so much!
Anyone else notice that ederson dove to his right every time
City defense is going to be the Achilles heel this year I believe anyone with speed on the wings and a deadly striker will give them trouble
Who else loves watching soccer ❤
En Nesyri looked like he was playing goalie with those gloves
now THIS is how highlights length should be, at least 15 mins
Palmer is a star in the making . Rodri what a pass!! Most consistent player in that team.
Can’t remember when was Pep’s last penalty shootouts, to see him apprehensive like that..
63:50 whoopsy😂😂
i love Haaland but bros been ghost in every final man city has won, messi clears for his 8th balon d or
Jesus loves you-!
Penalties are a sucky way to end a match
Sevilla should of won
En nesyri is so brilliant in the air man! Credit to city for their first trophy this season.
A top premier league team that won everything, struggled to beat a non top la liga team.  I been saying this for years,  u can get any la liga team beside barcelona and real madrid and put  them in premier league, they will cause problems for premier league top 6 and will win premier league without a doubt.  I understand premier league is more balanced, but not the strongest league.  Even though Italy is not that top league like they used to be, but premier didn't get any stronger, they just have less league to compete with
Anthony taylor referee is crying all day for Sevilla loss , Taylor is the disgraced corrupted referee that loves Sevilla , he's #1 fan of the spanish team
Grealish and foden are overrated, they can’t get one cross in to save their lives
Akanji was a sieve this game, his errors caused a lot of Sevilla chances
Palmer has become to be an impressive player
Manchester city suck , they are not going to win anything this season , the downfall begins
Was rooting for Sevilla ❤❤❤❤❤❤ we fought good 👍👍👍👍
Rather win this penalty shootout than the Community Shield one🎉
Bro
Fixed games. Now every final match ends in penalty kicks. That's what's gonna happen in the females world cup final. Just like Argentina VS. France. Fixed game. Final penalty kicks. So there's your bet.
Ederson coming up in a big game again!
I would love to see more Palmer playing, what a young talent
Haaland was no where to be found.
Halaand is not good against any big team. And without kDB city look disorganized.
What happened to extra time
Sevilla didn’t deserve to be there anyway
Glad to see City practiced their forward runs with Haaland and the right side runs coming in for the header, because last game Haaland tried to high kick the strike from Bernardo. But this time, he knew Cole was coming in right beside him for the better angle to score.
bono took the loss so hard he went to saudi
Thumbnail completely gave away the ending.  Disliked video.  Stop giving away the endings.
Holy I’m so surprised a man city trophie
Very tough way to lose a game.  City on some kind of run.
Time & time again the luckiest team ever.
Palmer is a great youth talent for City! He has the potential to replace the goals Mahrez took with him!
The goalkeeper won the cup!
النصيري كاي سجل كرات صعاب انا كرات سهلين ازكلهم
Sevilla was great defensively in this match, had the better chances.
Bruh 63m my boy getting millions but can’t chip a goalie one on one twice to win it like it’s city n for a trophy like that’s what happens
congrats SEVILLA.....it was very close!!!......City was a bit "lucky' last night!......Still congrats Guardiola and Team!!!
I suspect City will struggle to get goals this season. With Debryne out now, i dont see enough creativity/assist. Grealish is overrated, average and not very effective. Silva dribbles alot with little end product. Haaland will need someone to create chances for him but i don’t see anyone. They should have kept Mahrez too.
Even the missed penalty was terrific . Palmer is a star in the making .
What happened with Haaland?  He wasn't the Messi factor for his team. So the ballon d'or goes to... the goat Lionel Messi.
Why is it in greece though? Pointless. The game should be at a location thats halfway between both Europa/UCL winners
Not a great ending.
I gotta say, Haaland is really missing service. If this is the sign if things to come, he'll get desperate indeed. Losing Gündogan and Mahrez was bad, then having KDB out is gonna seriously dent City. Except..... except the other contenders bottle things as always. That's not new.
Best manager won. Case close
Some incredible penalties in that shootout that’s so crazy Sevilla coulda easily won GG city
sevilla could have ended the game very early. thats how bad citeh will be this season.. no gundogan. no KDB =  no Haaland hahaahahahahahahahaha and soon laporte will leave. and so will bernardo silva...  ADIOS CITEH...  thank you for playing all these years.. haahahahahahah
Gvardiol is too slow... hahahaahahaha slow mo....
cole palmer is a baller
Go city
Why does the super cup still exist?
Very tightly contested game! Both Manchester City & Sevilla missed sitters. Some big saves by each keeper. Congratulations to Pep & his players. Man City Super Cup Winners!🏆 C'mon CITY!!!🙌💙
Sevilla robbed
Tbh this city team just isnt the same. Without KDB theyre still a quality team, but hes the best olayer in the world. I dont think thwyrr high enough quality to execute peps system. Ake and akanji are good enough for me at getting high forward.
Forza Roma💛❤️
City needs to stop playing Grealish
Palmer surely learning from B Silva
man city is lucky
City without Gundogan and KDB is completely different compared to when they both play
How many chances does En-Nesyri need over here? Chip, do a shuffle, sell a dummy but please don't hit it first time grounded shots every friggin time..
Nothing more boring than a City win.
Ederson had an amazing game! Let’s go lads
Props to Sevilla man
Haaland has been really ineffective, only scores on bottom league teams. What a waste of money from man city. Overrated player.
Kovacic is a good player but a big downgrade from Gundogan. replacing Mahrez will be very hard, too. they are more vulnerable, i think. I'm surprised they didn't try to get Caicedo
honestly Ederson was MVP
Did Haaland play today ?
Dang Congrats #6 😘🤩❤️‍🩹💭🗯💬👣🎭⛑️❓️❓️⚽️🥅🛑 Challenging game Supercup ⚖️ Well played Sevilla 2006
Congrats to Man City  Arsenal fan from Los Angeles.
well played Sevilla, another trophy for Man City
Pep is old and is wearing Justin Bieber outfit from 10 years ago lmfao
El-Nesyri is their hero and at the same time their downfall but good game from both sides
city lucky
Haaland is a fraud 🤡🤡🤡
winners of the UCL vs the team that couldnt make it past group stage in UCL what a pointless match , players are already being pushed to their limit w international duty
Man City are lucky they won Sevilla should’ve put them outta their misery with those god awful finishes. Was Haaland playing tonite? Seems like against better teams he can’t score for sh*t 😂.
Sevilla missed to many opportunities. They've won this game. City didn't play great and Halland can't show up in big games.
Sevilla had to be more clinical
Football has migrated to Saudi Arabia. This is where all the great players are now.
It’s rare that you get a chance to appreciate how good Ederson is, he had some really nice saves.
Boring af.
Haland cant still score in finals
Good game!
Manchester City had all the possessions, but they conceded first. Soccer ⚽️ 🏟 for you. You have to be clinical upfront if you were to win games. Great game by both teams 👏 Sevilla had a tons of dangerous chances than Man City
Thanks CBS I have no idea who won based off the thumbnail
Sevilla could have done so much more damage if they didn’t park the bus all game. On counter attacks is just 1 man by himself
I am a City  fan but  I am not sure that they will be as dangerous this year without Mahrez and Gundogan. Liverpool could be the big danger with a team largely intact. Arsenal will  play well again in the year but falter in the end
7:25 proof we're living in a simulation
Who’s that blonde girl with number 9 in MC?😂
Great 90 minutes from both Goalkeepers
Sevilla wasted opportunities with the En Nesyri runs :( why were none of the others keeping up, could've been easy tap ins
No offense but this commentating team was dreadful to listen to. I don't know if anyone else has similar thoughts
City look like they're getting bored of trophy presentations 😂
En-Nesyri good goal and so many clear misses! 🤣 The difference between being good and being great
who ever edited this video is so caringe for putting the picture of man city as champions for this video. what a great job you did bud!!!!! @CBS editor
Commentator was so monotone but it was exciting to watch nonetheless!
Why does he sound so depressed
Bono after every penalty conceded: 😁
After the community shield, this felt really good.   Class to Sevilla, you played great, and were just as deserving as us.
Who is Palmer ? He's very talented.
As a Man City fan, I respect Sevilla. They play really good this match, they are amazing.
so no Kate, Thierry, Carra, and Big Meeks?😥😥😥
As a Man city Fan We are Still champions Of Europe😢
So happy for Walker. Mans just wanted to feel appreciated after coming off the bench the last few games of last season and now look at him, steering the lads to more trophies.
Congratulations again you all are my heroes and the best in the world, keep it that way
People miss understand why city bought haaland . They didn’t bought haaland so he can pass dribble 3-4 defenders  then score . They bought him so he can score the chances man city creates per game . Let’s not forget when haaland wasn’t there city wouldn’t score some clear chances that would of definitely help us in the champions league . Getting kick out by Lyon the champions league with a horrendous miss by sterling . And the following seasons as well . As soon as haaland comes in man city won champions league . Don’t forget he was the top scorer in the same season
Lol Nesyri literally gave away the game. Man City is like an average level epl team without Ilkay and Kevin, what a massive downgrade of gameplay.
Cole Palmer is a young not as experienced Mahrez type. Give him time on the pitch and he may become as effective.🏆
Sevilla have only themselves to blame for missed opportunities.
is the quality terrible for anyone else?
Those penalties were excellently taken! I'm really impressed. Even the one that didn't go in was not saved by the keeper. Really thrilling shootout!
Hahahhaaa Sevilla sorry
"Pick that one out"🤓🤓
so nic4 to knows who wins before i watch… love these dumb middle school level editors they have
Sevillas missed chances killed them but props to them for almost winning
That crossbar is revenge for the crossbar Anderson smashed against sevilla to lose in preseason
En-Nesyri messed it all up had easy chances
Halland has basically just won this trophy by just standing on the field...
What would make the Super Cup more interesting is if the winner is automatically placed in the knockout stages of the CL.
wolf
Arsenals still winning the league
Think this solidifies that messi deserves the Ballon D'or over Haaland
Penalties suck. It’s understandable, but still sucks.
Did anybody see haaland dissapear for city' goal 🤔 😂  7:23
Akanji is so ehh
the tap in machine ghosting in finals again lol
How many trophies does man city have ?
Man city was not focused at all but still made it!
All city fans glad your Hand to cole Palmer best player for man city safe to say good option for mahrez replacement but omg am I the only one who thinks man city got weaker idk man I don’t think we stronger like past season
Wow. Sevilla should have fun if they had a striker that could finish those two sitters. I guess without DeBruyne, Man city may be in trouble 🤯
Cole Palmer is one to watch for both City and England. He’s also black through his father.
Scott Carson 😮
Gotta love Scott Carson pushing Cole Palmer into place so he’d be visible during the trophy lift
En Nesyri could really had 4 goals if he hadn’t had those pathetic finishes
I have high Hopes For player 80 Hope he gores up to be in the hall of fame.
I think the England women team (World Champions in waiting) would give City a run for their money if they competed against each other.
Otra copa para Julián Álvarez
M8 sevillas striker is trash 😭
Palmer is playing phenomenal. Another trophy for City. Love it! Hit them Pep!
It's hard to believe this Man City team nearly lost 3-1 and won a treble a few months ago.  Sevilla ended in 12th place in La Liga last season and won their seventh Europa League title, but still.
Man city have looked horrible this year
No importa el sevilla ya esta en la champions
City not good at all luck was on their side
Bono to Liverpool would be heaven
Why is it every time I watch akanji play he’s putting Ederson in trouble
This team lacks creativity without KDB Mahrez Gundogan and B Silva smh we’re going to get beat up on in the EPL this year if we keep playing like this! This would be a draw in our league so just 1 point not no trophy 🏆 and that nonsense ain’t cutting it in the best soccer ⚽️ league in the world 🌎
Haaland was like I didn’t hear the champion league anthem here so no goals
This goes to show how lucky Man City were in winning the Champions League. That's being too kind... For the opposing teams to lose the CL and Supercup.  Sevilla were the better team, didnt take their chances. Inter played a great game, and didnt take their chances. They will always be just a small club with money.
Wondering why Diaz and Stones were not Starting or playing? 2 of the most dominating players in the world 🌎
7:22 The ball knows how to become ant-man and became smaller.
wow, man city squekin wins out now? we'll see how long this lasts
If only en-nesyri scored 1 more
Sevilla could have won had they actually finished their chances, they made man city look very beatable. I think this is similar to the uxl finals where inter had a lot of control in that game but couldn't finish. And it ended 1-0 with an unreal goal by rodri. That game trult could have went either way. I think this also shows just how impossible kdb is.
Newcastle will destroy this team on the weekend.
Another trophy haaland ghosted in
Halland ballon’dor 💪😎🐐
CITY CITY CITY
Sevilla are crazy when they’re competing in any playoffs
No extra time?
Sevilla could’ve won if they had McGuire assisting them
En-Nesyri could have had a hattrick
Grealish is so annoyingly predictable and stale
It looks like a RITUAL now, that the UCL winner always wins the SUPER CUP…😅 As I a fan of HALA MADRID, SEVILLA we’re not proud of you, I guess we’ve to get this revenge by ourselves 😅😅
Miss Mahrez, Gundo, Bernardo Silva 😢
The second half was so thrilling to watch - back and forth attacking on both sides. It took Manchester City a while to grow into the game, but they looked like the City from last season in the second half. They deserved the win, but Sevilla put up one hell of a fight. I feel like a lot of people weren't giving them a chance. While I didn't think they'd win, I knew it had the potential to be a close one. That's two European trophies in two months for Guardiola's side.
Y’all really messed up putting man City lifting the cup as a thumbnail, I wanted to watch the highlights without knowing the result
When arsenal won the community shield they said it would boats them up for the season. Now that city win this trophy whats does this means for city😂😂😂
Cole palmer incoming💫
Pep playing half a team and still wins😂
Commentators sound like big Saville fans😂
that nesyri first goal is one of the best headers ive seen
Today Man City had the luck of champions. Because en nesyri  should've easily won the game for Sevilla.  Great champions Man City regardless.
Not a man city fan, but palmer is a firecracker, awesome player. The potential that the man city youth players have is unbelievable. Not only palmer, many others. Excellent scouting and youth academy. Wow wow wow. Guardiola doing a good job too, took me years to admit it 😂😂😂 respect pep
You could tell the final third was not as smooth without KDB
My man halaand has been ghosting in every important game 💀💀 mbappe is so clear of this tap in merchant
These announcers blow
Funny how people hated on Arsenal's win and celebration over City, the best team in the world,  all while City players scream over a Super Cup and everyone celebrates with them 😂😂😂
Sevilla lost it!
Should have left Lamela On 🤷‍♂️ 😊
Is KDB hurt?
Shootouts almost as well taken as at the women's world cup!
City will be average this season. Newcastle may actually win them this weekend.
Even the missed penalty was terrific ❤
Damn. Wanted Sevilla to win. Hate Man City
ghost man haaland
As a city fan.....I feel bad that we are missing KDB And Gundogan😢
De Bruyner was missed greatly fortunate result, Sevilla was right there
En- Nesyri and Bouno should play in the premier league
I don't like that extended highlights mean half of the time the game..  half the shootout
Congrats MC! I believe without Gundogan and Bruyne, Julian Alvarez will be a better fit than Halland...... Halland won't get too many services to score, Alvarez can go out there and look for the ball!
Sevilla were great on the counter attack. Just couldn't finish.. well played.. congratulations city
Watch Jack Grealish get hammered again. 🤣🤣
People are criticizing Haaland because he didn't perform in big matches this season, and think the ballon dor should just be handed to Messi. It's true that he didn't perform in the big games, but Messi only performed in the world cup and that's it. Got suspended for 2 weeks, and also didn't perform for PSG this season, and the big match against Bayern.
More silverware heading to ManC...Sevilla were excellent and could have won convincingly...
Julian Alvarez has all that Man City trophies plus the World Cup & Copa America.
I rlly wish Haaland was a more exciting player. Like dude stop waiting for a tap in every game
Hey it’s the FIFA announcer
Would have been more dope if you didn’t ruin the ending in the thumbnail   :)
The Super Premier smashing La Liga club. 🥴
From a man u fan, Palmer nice with it👍🏻
Such a dead trophy lift 😭
Bono always looks like he was kidnapped, and his captor just said, "Look natural."  Something about the uncomfortable body language and the unnatural smile.
My cry for thee City, without KDB, we seem toothless. Pep needs to device a way to help the team and the world not to miss KDB.
City should have let Walker go to Bayern
Sevilla is one of the most luckiest team ever. They play average and wins trophies. En-nesyri is a horrible striker!
Imagine if we had a Roma vs City  Guardiola vs Mourinho
Rodry is on fire 🔥 ❤
City had a touch time breaking down Sevilla near the box, they just couldn't figure them out.  On the balance of play I'd say Sevilla were the better team but when it comes down to pens anything can happen.
Sevilla just showed how to play against man city. Better finisher and it's 3-0 before 1-1.
City needs reinforcements asap, they struggled against Burnley and they didn't look the part today,  Gundogan and De bruynye is hurting them plus Mahrez brought something different. They need help at the back and in midfield
Congrats to Man City! They will not have a golden run in Premier League this season.  2023-24 season will be closely fought than last two seasons. Who said Haaland is better then Messi this season?  Ballon D’Or winner 2023 is Messi!
In Pep, we trust. 💙
Haaland is just smiling everytime his teammates score in the shoot out.
Bro got a Tom and Jerry tattoo on his neck, how do you trust this guy in a penalty shootout.
Was there ever a doubt that city would win? its arguably the best club in the world vs some team that barely finished in 7th in the laliga, How was city having trouble with these guys? Had En Nesyri taken a touch on that 2nd sevilla chance they would've had 2
Thumbnail pic gave it all away and ruined the excitement of that first goal by Sevilla
Prem teams should take heart from this Sevilla performance and study it. City were second best for stretches and Sevilla could've put it to bed tbh.
City are going to have a tough run in the league. Between UCL, injury, and getting the new team settling in, there will be challenges and frustration. Haaland will be starved. The loss of Ilkay and Kevin are to be felt very soon. I don't think Foden is capable of replacing any one of them, let alone both.
Айдеее СИТИИИИИИИ Даййй момчеееее
Great game .City was better team why Grealish was by far biggest disappointment.Only one good ball send inside the box out of 50.Goundogan and Mahrez were way more dangerous than Grealish and Kovacic.
Jesus man these commentators are boring
The thumbnail didn’t give anything away at all 😂
Neayri trash how does he miss 2 good chances dudes only good in the air and that’s it 💀
Haaland has won more trophies in one year, than Harry Kane entire career 😢(4)
walker 😳😳
😂 was Haaland playing? Or was he hiding in someone pocket?
And they want Haaland to win the ballon d’or? He’s always ghosting in big matches
Bono you the star why you leaving 😭😭😭
Sevilla should’ve won it, they need to scout for a better striker who can have a higher rate of finishing.
Palmer is ready
Man. City 💖💖🏆🏆
Who?? KING PEP!
Sucks Sevilla play very well
Al nassir is good with the headers but with his feet he can’t finish
these english commentators show no passion that’s why i prefer spanish commentators
No matter how biased, Spanish ball will always rival English ball.
Hey CBS Sports Golazo, quit ruining the result for people who had to work on a Wednesday and wanted to watch your 21 minute video with a bit of suspense.... you should fire whoever decided man city holding the trophy should be the thumbnail
Not a hater of Man city.. but tired of seeing them winning every cup 😂😂😂
I've said it over and over again and i will keep saying it, Haaland goes missing in important games. CL semis he went missing, final went missing, FA final went missing, this past game against Arsenal he went missing and they lost, and now he goes missing again. And he is a pure striker, he has to score in those big games.
En-nesyri need to learn how to play football using foots not head
Rodri what a pass!! Most consistent player in that team
Bono is such an underrated goalie, it's criminal. He could play in premier League and be at the top of the list EASY
Sevilla is a tough tough opponent. Hats off to them for giving tough competition to this City side
haaland keeps on ghosting in big games. dude can only score against bottom table teams...
Why do they put the winner as cover picture for the video?? Like I didn’t. Get a chance to watch it earlier and really wanted to still be surprised
City need to get better
En Nyseri is a monster in the air!!
Man City graduates man
Haaland will struggle to do much with the lack of service now that the likes of de Bruyne and Gundogan are out of the picture. Foden is more of a scoring winger than someone who will feed the ball forward to Haaland, and this new Palmer guy looks to be the same.
Super Cup  - Super Team!!!!
Sevilla can not win this competition lmao
Sevilla lost this game at the peril of missing numerous chances.
I love how it says the ucl even tho it’s the super cup
Show's how great kdb is , hes the glue to the team
Looks like Haaland already saving himself for Real Madrid. He’s done nothing in big games.
Respect for Sevilla, gave it there all, just missed the last penalty, congrats city, BLUE MOON
Without kdb they're nothing 😂 sevilla weren't beaten today by city,  they lost to themselves.
Halaand was just floating all game  No creativity, just wants the ball spoon fed. His positioning was horrible!  And he was in a bad mood all game like WTH?!   Or am I just seeing things?
Palmer is a star in the making 🤝
En-Nesyri should've really had Sevilla out of sight with that second chance. congrats to Man City
Cole Palmer seems like a pretty solid replacement for Mahrez. He played really well in the Community Shield and then this game, and if you can stand out in a match for a trophy on a current Man City squad then you got a bright future.
Haaland got a trophy for basically just standing there the whole game fair play
Why Haaland not showing up in important matches though?
Heart break for Sevilla
City by their standards played badly yet they still managed to win the trophy.
Without Kdb haaland can’t score goals
Did halland play today?
Man city rn is too deadly
Y tecatito?
Taking off extra time so that City doesn’t bottle the game. I see you UEFA 👀😂😂😂
thank god they removed extra time we would have definitely lost but i will take it lmaooo
Congratulations Manchester city
*Haaland needs to start showing up in important games man*
Didn't know I was this early, honestly feels Illegal
*Sevilla and Man Citty both played well but props to Sevilla they always show out when playing against some of the biggest clubs in the world. Lets not forget they beat Man united, Juventus, Roma and almost beat the UCL champions.* 👏🔥
Muchas gracias cbs sports golazo
Where the fck is extra time
Nice sharing Vidio 🇮🇩⚽⚽🌸🌼👍👍
Early
City Is building a dynasty of football
First?
First
Taking off extra time was disgusting
