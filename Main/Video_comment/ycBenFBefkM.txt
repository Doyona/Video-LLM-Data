Thus reminds me if how Nigerians pound yam...its intriguing
Dam need to get one of the mochi
Asian moms to kids be like :
why am I getting pounded... then thrown...
this is how asian parents hit there kids brings back memories 💀
Ok I’m am not trying to be mean but the way they “pound it” to make it “softer” seems redundant like you can just get a machine to do it, but mostly in the second phase of “pounding” the hammer guy has to barely put momentum into his swings due to the other “pro” guys hands putting dribbles of water on it like seriously he could just sprinkle some on. Him lightly tapping the Mochi with wets hands is not that efficient. Then. Again what do I know maybe I’m wrong.
That’s what I call food abuse
Poor Jimin..
Yummy 😋
The beating i get when i get a 88% in class
bro got beat the shit out of
What are they doing to hulk's balls??

My dogs name is mochi… “ this is how they pound mochi “
It coast like 92 pence where I'm from I googled it and 20,000 is 122.00 lol
Sounds like ¥150 too much
What is mochi?

"Once the mochi's done getting its pounding"  *sighs and opens comments*
POV: When samurais retire
Wait, I’m not criticizing but when they were pounding did they have gloves on?  If not I don’t care how much it cost. If I can see their not wearing gloves I’m not eating their product and this is even pre Covid. Just personal preference, not judging as each to their own.
BULBASAUR NOOO
If your man don't pound you this hard, leave him
Why you slappin the mochi like that
btw 150 yen is like -4 cents
I wish I was that mochi…

Stepdads in Alabama when their sons don't get 100% on their report cards
Get saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, before it is too late!
Hello I want to share that God of Abraham loves us all, and that was shown when Jesus Christ died for us on the cross. If you have any time please seek Him, because I am sure no one wants to go to hell... Because when you go there, you will burn forever and feel the worms or maggots inside your body moving and you gonna burn there without dying.

REPENT OF YOUR SINS, FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NEAR. your sins will take you to hell, but Jesus wants a relationship with you to set you free from hell. we’ve all broken God’s moral laws by sinning against Him, but Jesus came and paid our fine. repent and trust in Jesus to be saved. He’s the ONLY way to heaven. God bless you🦋
When they started hitting the mochi my brain immediately heard. Ora Ora Ora Ora Ora oraaaaa
Dang 150 yen that’s like a dollar for some delicious mochi
Me when I see baby yoda
The Knights of Ren when they find Grogu
My peanut brain is always confused about different currency because you know when you live somewhere you just randomly think that everything‘s the same in other places so it hurts my brain to compare a dollar in yen because the numbers are so different so it’s not just me right?
Ugh 😩 I wanna be that mochi  so baad😒😔
That’s expensive 150 yen is 1 dollar and 9 cents
Me and the Bois when we see the Grinch on Christmas:
After seeing them make mochi Who remember the Doraemon scene if yes like

Giggity
America: Hmmm, interesting, I’ll probably resell those for around 300-500 USD.
POV: they used to work for a mob boss
I choked on it once   Wasn’t fun
"Once the mochi is done getting its pounding"    Everyone: 😏
And that’s why you don’t bother mochi stores.
Me and the bois after catching the Grinch stealing our gifts at Christmas:
I want to pound it 😳
Jeez they are so aggressive
Hey I lost my bulbasau-OH MY GOD
“After the mochi’s done getting it’s pounding,”  That’s not a pounding that’s a BEATING
어..떡친다ㅋㅋㅋ🫣😂
150 yen is $1.50 or a little bit more
Chicorita NOOO

Beastars op in the background you have taste
"Once the mochi's done getting its pounding, it's thrown into a machine to fill it up-"
The song is the background is by YOASOBI. she has some really great music, with a unique sound. If you like Japanese music you should check her out.
Mochi sun kei mukhei laga shoes dekh.
They seem mad, like they so aggressive when they pound it
I also get thrown when im done getting my pounding 😏
YOASOBI, SO VERY COOL MUSIC
We watched that exact video in our music class then we played a timing game that was not nearly as scary and then we sang a little song about it  Edit: I am now realizing my music class was kinda strange
Thats actually Thanos and red skull making sure that gamora is really dead

The Japanese have No Mercy when it comes to Mochi, they straight up beat the living shit out of em
Katakuri's tragic backstory
Is it a good way to take out anger is my question
The first half, when mom and dad finds the report card 💀
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
Katakury
wish i got pounded like that fr
Katakuri: This is all the trouble u had to do? Pathetic
Would definitely pound a mochi 10/10
Nooo the creeper is dead. Minecraft need a new mob.
nah that’s not mochi just me after don’t clean my room.
I want my name to be mochi now
What's mochi
Katakuri would be devastated
So thats how mochi fruit made
日本やっぱ大好き
Katakuri liked this
the song...
The bg music is 怪物 by yoasobi (one of my favorites songs)
Everyone: nice video  Me: what is that music ? I hear that before.            In osu!
My bff would lie that job(I am my bff this might help with wanting to punch someone
"Once the mochi's done getting its pounding, it's thrown to get filled up with paste"  that needs context
Me listening to music during chores:
its mostly just for show so they can charge more since the "entertainment" is part of it. the chemical reaction of the mochi ingredients are what give it it's texture, not some random slaps and karate chops lmao. but anything to impress the mutts
Pause💀
I like how they have it on display to humiliate the mochi being pounded
Soybean powder? Nope. Not eating it. I'm not gonna be a soy boy.
Katakuri: alr ima head out
Broo I don't think katakuri paid them enough
“Eye brow raise “
it balances out you burn the amount of calories in the mochi by just making it
YOASOBI? love yoasobi and Beastars
Onec the mochi is done getting pounded ayo I now wish I was mochi now
Mochi bussinnnn😅
Close your eyes and listen to the video.
God, imagine being 0.001 second too late and you get your hand slammed by the hammer
Bro that's not pounding that's torture
Mochi getting more action than me
Who else wants to go to japan?
Yo why they do green Kirby like that
I bet you he’s smiling under that mask at the end
the Beastars S2 theme in the background too lmaoo
The mochi:😭😔😞🙍‍♀️🫤wHYyYyY…:(
Background music is beastars op 1
😩
Learned about this in elementary school
So that’s how katakuri got his devil fruit
Thats only $1.10 in the us
Poor katakuri
This guy finally let out his anger
the yoasobi in the background💃🕺
Monster hunter moments
With hands like these who needs hammers.
Mowchee?
“One of the best” bruh, at least lie and say it’s the best after they let you record all that
Katakuri-sama
I have played monster hunter and that is exactly what happens . It’s a pretty fun game and very realistic
150 yen = 1.10$
The mochi got yeeted
This is just a distraction while they are mutilating dolphins out back
Don’t you know katakuri have a free mocha ?
My family would love that place lol
Me after raging in a game: does the whole pounding for an entire day
Violence solves everything, even making food.

The traditionally used machines? That doesn’t sound right.
I’ve had “mochi” once. It was at my local coles and they had this little stand thing where you could buy macaroons and mochi, but the mochi was basically like an icy pole. It had a somewhat doughy and cold outside and a FROSTBITE OF AN INSIDE. Was still nice for Aussie brand “mochi” lol.
Is it me that the old man look liked you but older mm
It kooks 🤢
God dam $1.50 of mochi

Whenever I hear Mochi .... I just remember KataKuri
I lived in japan as a kid on a military base. For special occasions like school festivals, the school would bring in people who made mochi and we got to eat some. Fresh stuff is completely different
Why are there only food videos whenever I'm trying to go to sleep 😩

They are even getting pleasure from it. I feel so hopeless and alone. Hello could you please help me please  Ive been abused all my life they need to be punished it's not fair they aren't even taking me seriously.  They bullied holes in me and trying to eat me. Giving me brain bleed. To tip it off they pushed me into a psychosis and I ate a plastic ball I need surgery but they are ignoring me helo me help me

YOOOSSHHIII NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Bad children get thrown into the mochi pounder
Me after realising kaibutsu playing in the background-😍😍😍😍
Africans pound yam in a similar manner but with pistles.
The reason for the yelling while smacking and hammering is to produce a rhythm. Especially with time, it can become second hand to move alongside a partner in such a dangerous task while moving really quickly because they can already interpret when everything should be happening and at what rate at all times. Super neat to have this method so widespread :))))
Ice climbers be like
Where's my job interview 😂
He was Aggressive hitting that green stuff
How much is 150 yan?

poor Yoda
Every man at the club when they see a girl:
Season 2 Opening of Beastars Monster by Yoasobi is what’s playing in the background. Look it up. Thank me later. 😎
The word mochi reminds me of Jimin 😂💜
Katakuri: AYO STOP TAKING PIECES OUT OF ME

Imagine walking off to the store, just to see someone's beating the shit out of that mochi 💀
Rip to green kirrby

I love how this is the behind the scenes of my favorite Japanese desert 👁👅👁
“Done getting pounded” 😳
The mochi’s favorite time of the day
JIMIN RUNNNNNN
I pound my mochi everyday
Best job if you have pure anger issues and need management with that 😃
Japanese food and culture is just so beautiful... It all seems so perfect sometimes
The urge to make a your mom joke has never been greater
What does mochi taste like?
That’s a really peaceful way to make moshi
Getting it pounding
This have to be fullfilling, when you are angry at someone. Beat at the mochi...
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. - John 3:16 from the Bible ❤❤🥰
*Me eating mochi whilst eating this*    Oh sh-

That’s how me and my siblings be fighting ngl 🥴
Did you find tiny hairs from fingers?
The cook going full power on mochi
so happy to see he's still in business during covid
i wouldnt be close to brave enough to eat it
Poor mochi
There’s a Japanese school in America called Asahi, and on special days, there’s an event where you can make mochi’s with that method. My siblings used to attend there but holy shinnanigans the work there is too much. They’re now in kumon.
餅つきはなんか見たくなるよね
They whopping that dough like ma mama whopping my but😎
Me: *Hits hand on the side* *Brain.exe stopped working*

お餅はとても美味しいです( ・∇・)

Old man be using the sharingan

According to Doremon series This is the riceball of the moon
In case yall thinking 150 yen is a lot.. 1000 yen is only 10$ basically..  So a super delicious,stretchy mochi is only 1.50$
I hear that beastars intro of the second season. I feel u
Imagine if 1st guy who have hammer accidentally hit on his hand 😐😐
I think I saw him in one of Business Insider's videos. Good to know he is still doing dandy
RIP Katakuri
Awsome..I love japanese food
I'ma beat my mochi
I noticed and heard the anime opening of Beastars at the background🥰💖
うまそーー！
Mochi abuse
I have major respect for him he put so much passion in to his work 🙌 👏
I remember Jimin now🤣
men in the 50’s when they get home from work to their wife and kids angry:
ONLY 150?!
Katakuri
Doraemon watchers assemble
Bare hand pounding put me off this
As he handles the mochi bare handed.
Oh yea I've seen people pound mochi like this in monster hunter 😅
You do the same to your younger siblings. Pound them till their soft
150 yen =1.30 usd if anyone wants to know
I love mochi
Beastars second intro is the background music
きなこは美味しい😊
Yeah this is definitely my new favorite channel very cool 😎👍
To bad I can't eat it
YOSHI NOOOOOOOOOO
So 1.50$? The only reason I'm not going to Japan now is because I don't got money
Mochi makers be like: we make our mochi with love
No offense but just a fun fact that mochi is the word used for cobbler in Hindi in india
“Once the mochi is done Getting it’s pounding”
The kid named Moche
I REMEMBER SEEING THAT GUY ON GREAT BIG STORY
Too easy.
Why does this feel like a really strange fetish
Kattakuri has unlimited mochi and he can give you mochi before even you ask him mochi🌪️
They found baby Yoda
Katakuri aprova
What is 150 yen worth in American dollars
Him: it’s only 150$  Me: it’s only my whole bank account
If you  want to make mochi play fps games
BOBA MOCHI! BOBA MOCHI! so this how they make that
I wonder what mochi taste like

I saw that guy in a Boss coffee ad, what a legend
My dad playing fruit ninja:
I don't fking care about anythis this dude saying, I'm vibing at the background music which is my favorite of all ❤️
In India mochi means cobbler 🤣
*Real question did they wash* *hands?*
If anybody's wonder what the music is in the background, its called monster by YOASOBI
If you are wondering what the bgm is, it’s monster from yoasobi
I saw this in doreamon in which Gian is making this for his mother who sawed that episode
That's food abuse
Its batter than than India food making shops cleaning
Imagine having your hand smacked by that hammer
Them:Harder The mochi:👁👄👁what did u say
Mochi? In indiana its an ice cram treat with rice doh stuff on it.
Don't know how many years of Ninja degree they completed to beat a lifeless thing in this brutal way.
If I buy one and they don't buy it am going Karen mode
Imagine he throws the mochi and misses the machine
Hayi hayi hayi Legends already see this is in shinchan episodes
I-
Carpal tunnel syndrome
I went to a Japanese festival when I was 8 and got to do that”
Oo
Wow mochi got abused
ЧТО ВАМ ЖЕЛЕШКА ТО СДЕЛАЛА, ЗА ЧТО ЕЕ ВЫ ТАК БЬЕТЕ
They pound that mochi and said ah hey ah hay ah hey ah hey ah hey ah hey
The doctor with my balls during the physical exam:
Mochi - hey wait, don't beat me It's hurt , John it's hurts. Ouch ahh, ohh .. Ok it's relief now What why are you picking me now John don't throw me aw-- ""Throws"" 🙂
Bro Mochi in URUDU  means COBLER.
I heard the Japanese torture but, i wasn't know they are using it to make desert ?!

Katakuri
Once it's done getting it's pounding 😏😶

What is a mochi
Once it’s done getting it’s pounding 😏
Katakuri would be proud

It's like a mochi boba advertising
ARMYs are just remembering their Mochi also 😌💜🤣🤣 Jimnisssssssssssiiiiiii
I have seen this in doraemon in which Nobita and suneo make mochi 😅😅
How do you even get money in japan as an american
As much work as they do to prepare it seems like they would charge an arm and a leg 🤪🤪🤣🤣🤣
This shop is very famous.👍
When the Grinch seals your presence
The mochi certainly does look delicious. The pounding scene was extremely funny, but their hard work is appreciated! 🤍✨
So did anyone else recognize YOASOBI’s Monster playing in the background, no just me?
It's way too sticky. Take forever to break down. Definitely not my thing.
Uncle Roger needs to see this 🤣
Love the song in the background it's kaibutsu right
That what she said
“Once the mochi is done getting it’s pounding” Person named Mochi: 0_o
pretty sure that was karate training
handeye coordination hentaicoordination
I hate the chocolate flavour 🤮
“Finish it off with their hand” lmao
Job for psychopaths
Gotta enjoy the yoasobi music in the background tho
But nothing is sweet than our mochi Jiminshi
https://youtube.com/shorts/jhG9gVECN_U?feature=share
Old school mochi maker - reminds me of my childhood during the New Year when my parents, neighbors and friends would get together and do this. Automated mochi machines have made this artisan process rare. Glad you enjoyed it!
They had enough of the grinches shit
Slap that dough yeah like that
Poor poor mochi😞
Why do they look so aggressive making that mochi
Whait, is that a Kaibutsu playing on the background? Nice 0:

No. It’s not good. It’s chewy tasteless matter. But hey. Keep fooling yourself.
The secret of the recipe was never love...😭😭😭😭😭☠️
Guy named mochi: 👁👄👁
Ok to be honest, I never knew about this but also the guy look like he playing an drum instrument aggressively or just beating the living shit out of Mochi.
What did the mochi do 💀
Two big chinese dudes beating up dream
Ah yes, the traditional step in the ancient art of making mochi: "throw it in a machine" lol
BGM:MONSTER - yoasobi
Ok can someone answer me correctly so I was playing a game and someone was making fun of my user and then I made fun of theirs and they asked me what mochi was and I answered a food in Japan or something am I right or wrong please answer
Banger background music lol
I've never tried it but it sounds so good!

They are abusing the mochi 👁👄👁💧
누구나 5분만 해보면 다하는 기술아닌 기술
i ❤ Japanese

If the man getting his hands almost hit gets the same may as the lady who just rolls them I'll be mad
I always wanted to try mochi. It looks so yummy 😋
The bowling Kirby
It looks delicious! What does it taste like? Is there an American comparison
Bulbasaur NOOOO
Its like the (rick and morty) plungus commercial
Now I'm not a mochi maker but i did this on cooking mama and it was a f*cking pain, so the hard work put into this irl is much appreciated 👌🏾
It's amazing to see how people do certain things in other countries and it's so interesting
Fufu? 👀

That looks so nasty
Where's katakuri 🤣
But army baby mochi is cute and sweet 🤗🤗
I wish I was that mochi😩

In india you can't say mochi 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
やっちまったなー。
I think i found my talent
Paying hefty amount in Japan for delicate small portions of bite sized food lol
I remember this from cooking mama.
Katakuri rn: 👁👄👁
When you realise they are doing slime abuse:
My parents should have taught my brother to do this to manage his anger instead of judo
I almost went to Nara when I was in Japan but storm, trains being down due to communication issue, and period cramps all said no
did they wash their hands? Who wants poopy hand mochi?
Pound nice and hard
Poor Yoshi
for ppl that dont know: 150 yen is 1.32 in usd! its not expensive at all
How much is that in dollars
mochi abuse
In my mom's hometome back in China, i mean in the deep mountains, people still using the same way to make sticky rice cakes the same way, boy, it is quite an exciting event during the Chinese New Year prepping month! Only the best hands/feet get involved, and they make all the kids want to grow up faster and to be that strong, skillful and cool.
Nice song btw
Girl named Mochi: 😳
Jimin watching this-👁👄👁
Japan sold machines to the world and doing its own shit manually.
I thought jimin 💜

Ah Yes A Yoasobi Soundtrack😁
I was like mochi our mochi Jimin💜💜 And ran into the chat for finding army in chat 😂
I wanna be in that wooden bowl 😫
If you don't pay up, your balls are next
Imagine what these guys could do if you tried fighting them.Turn you into tenderized lumps of chump.
Not just hand eye coordination, thats some trust there   they look like they just do their own and just believe they wont mess up
Mochi be like when he got slap by a hand:yamete kudasai

POV: Jimin is beaten like this in 1867😵
The fact the He used The Song from yoasobi called "Monster" From english
"This is how mochi is pounded"  Jimin: 😃?

That looks entertaining
Ngl that looks really fun to do
Katakuri

Katakuri entered the chat
I have seen only in doreamon.🤣🤣🤣
the beastars theme in the background tho-
The Hai with every punch just makes this process even better to watch.
How much is 150 yen in euro or dollar?
This is how Tamils made rice flour hundreds of years ago! And instead of hammers, we had thick and heavy logs
Best
Mochi is sweet or spicy?
Mochi is in English dough
So this is how Jimin was made
He looks like a sweet grandpa who makes desserts for his kids lol
So this is how katakuri was made.... Interesting...
Remember the ep of doremon when they go to the moon just like this they work
Love pounding my mochi
Just so yall remember that *Aunt Cass'* Cat's name was Mochi too. 🌚
Such a stress reliever this work might be 💆🏻‍♀️
When ever you said Mochi, I always remembered Jimin (Baby Mochi) 😅😊💜💜 I Purple You Guys
When I saw mochi i thought jimin at that second 😂😂😅
We absolutely 💯 ❤️ ❤️ love mochi.
There's a whole different variety of these, all of them good.
Me and the boys beating up the grinch after he stole our Christmas presents:
In our locality, mochi is used to call  cobbler 😂.
Yoasobi
i learned this from the cooking mama game
My dad once did this in my Japanese school when I was learning at Okinawa,japan
Similar to the fufu making process
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Mochi jimin😂
When is 150 not much
きのこ？
"and that's how you make a plumbus"

Monster hunter Rise xD
Don't a shit ton of people die over this stuff each year?
Beastars theme song

Mochi were beaten so hard that the moment elderly eat it they went to heaven
If that hit the window

Если пропускает по пальцам,то в отпуск идёт за свой счет
They pound and hand it 😳😏
Katakuri🥲
That looks like great exercise
Papa.mochi.....jimin🥺😍💜💜
This looks like how they make fufu in Central/West Africa 😍
Pounding the mochi?!
They aboutta catch charges on that mochi 🤣
Any army
Is this the same shop that the Great Big Story interviewed? I'm  Pretty sure this is the shop on that vid.
なんか日本人としてコメント見てると面白いなぁ〜
The first part: *BONK* *BONK* *BONK*
For all the BTS army’s... This is how they made ✨ *Jimin* ✨
Ah the iron palm technique!!!!
Me hearing mochi.... My army soul: jimin
What exactly is it.
Yeah see through glass perfect for tourists
I can't believe I've spent a lifetime not knowing how amazing sweet red bean paste is. I've thought about attempting to make some at home. I've seen a few recipes that didn't look too terribly hard. I'm not much of a cook but I try my best lol. Anyone else make red bean paste at home? What did you do with it afterwards?
I'm addicted to red bean paste mochi. I only tried it for the first time a few months ago and omg.....at first, the idea of red bean paste seemed strange but once I actually tasted it, I was hooked. My 18 month old son loves them as well. I live in a really rural area so I can only buy them at an asian grocery about an hour away but I always "stock up" when I get the chance to go in there. I say it like that because they get gone so fast lol.
I hope I can have it too someday 😊😊😊😊😊  But literally everytime he said mochi jimin came to my mind 😝🥰💜💜💜💜
People really think they pound mochi like that everyday when they say it's for show 💀
What the nane of that background music?
Looks over done as though it's just a show for tourists
Imagine if that old man got robbed and he just do that thing to the robber.... That'll be fucked up
🥲 I want to go to JAPAN..… sob*sob*
Next Tekken 8 DLC Fighter: Mochi Maker
Wait ,nara Japan it is not nara shikamaru
After watching how they make the mochi, can't say I have the munchies.

Vegan as fuck! That is raad! 🙌🏻
Me when I see a child

Parents in training lol

If thats pink I would go: KIRBY NOOOOOO
I love Japanese food!
.....I'm apparently not mature enough for this video..... I've been stuck giggling on "after it gets it's pounding" for awhile now..
Damn Ditto is not spilling the beans and giving them the nuclear codes, no matter how hard they torture him.
Yoru ni kakeru by Yoasobi is the song in the background
People named Mochi: 😨
I waaaaaant iiiiit!!!
0:00 me at 3 am
I don't wanna eat my jiminie...💜🙂🥺😄
I have seen this in doremon.
The amount of dedication in making it makes me want to make sure to try it someday! It looks very good 👍
I thought you meant a fidget
150 yen = how much actual dollars 150??
Japanese can eat plastic bags and clean the ocean
Poor Yoda.
doesn't look edible
It looked like they were smacking a baby at the beginning 💀🤣
Army don't need mochi when they have very very cute and sexy mochi
Indonesia also has mochi, almost the same and it's named "kaloci"
U serious bruhh🙊
No one: Me: here just to listen to beastars op being used in the background
Is it just me or is Yosaobi- Kaibutsu playing in the background?

Practicing wing Chun at work here helps me a lot :D
Is mochi veg ? Eggless to be precise?
He said only 150 yen like that still ain't alot of money
Man why they beating my man katakuri up like that? Come on now.
Why u hit my mochi (jimin)... I love mochi
There's an African food pounded like this also. It's called pounded yam eaten with a soup and it's amazing how much strength and risk is taken
That mochi shouldn’t have been talking all that shit on live
With those mochi cheeks you definitely didn't fit through the daibutsu's nostril. Me either. That mochi was great!
I love that damn song
My son was watching Avatar the last Airbender... and while they were hammering the mochi, Prince Zuko was hammering a roof. They were in sync! Funny coincidence.
Soybean isn't good for consumption
Please spread the gospel! Just leave a comment like this please! Spreading the gospel is worth it! Im not forcing you but please!

I'm so sorry but I laughed so hard at the slapping. He looked so angry at it! "Who's your daddy?" 🤣🤣🤣
I had mochi once and I really didn't like it. It was way too bland for me. Even the chocolate filled ones were very bland. My friends absolutely die for them though, so I usualls give them my share when we go for asian food.
Damn bro whats that background music? You a furry or smth?
They beat the ever-living shit out of it lol
No wonder Katakuri is super strong
Mochi: harder daddy!! The dude pounding it: ight bet.

Nasty shit. Probably filled with covid

“Once the mochi is done getting its pounding”
Real men don’t eat soy ! Besides, it’s extremely bad, it depletes testosterone, and causes cancer.
GEAR FOURTH: SNAKEMAN

Nice to see you
So Nara clan is also famous for making mochi other than shadow manipulation Jutsu!!!
Os Japoneses são os melhores ❤️
YOSHI NOOO
I hear old people die from choking on mochi
They pound it using the 500 year old tradition by hand with wooden mallets (which were also made by hand)  BUT then they have a machine make hundreds of littlb⁴ and fill it up with the red bean paste., an even older Japanese tradition. 🤣🤪🤣
Charlotte katakuri claps them

"Then they finish it off with their hands" 😏
That's the family gym right there.. All that pounding making me hungry though
Actually that's daifuku, Mochi is a Korean treat and its more rectangular. A lot of you have been lied to about what Mochi is 💔
Luffy be like: so many katakuri I need war
Hand eye coordination is detrimental when pounding your mochi.
“Once the mochi is done getting pounded” god I feel bad for Mochi he never was very accustomed to that type of shit
i love mochis and the background music makes it all better
That's how a plumbus is made
No more masks
Yooooooo they're playing a yaosobi song in the background! (Its a japanese music band and I think this album/track is called monster)
I cant stomach red bean paste 😫 I've tried in so many different ways even made it at home and its not my friend. But I find myself still trying lol
I pound my mochi much differently
Me when I find baby yoda
Replace "mochi" with "my mom" and this is accurate.
My guy was slapping tf outta that mochi,   idky but that part killed me🤣🤣☠
Poor mochi 😢
I went there in 2019, missed the pounding by 5 minutes but the mochis were godly anyway. hot and soft.

God I wish that were me.
Is that Mochi? I thought that was daifuku
I love seeing elder dude fight mochi😆😌
Isn't this the food that actually kills a lot of people from choking?
Mochi KILLS people in Japan . If you can't chew it like children or elderly ,the mochi can stick in your throat and suffocate you . Lovely grub.
I love the Moshe
The way they slap the h out of it mad me lmao
Kaibutsu by Yoasobi was a great music choice, that song is such a banger

The gray haired old man looks like he's got so much character~ the way he throws the mochi into the machine~ heh~
What is moch?
I love when they finish it off with their hands
Remember guys, chew your mochi and don’t try to eat it whole. You can die from it.
Beating that stuff like it's their child after they got a B+ in math class.
Imagine the muscles on those guys man, getting to wave around big wooden hammers
Sus
I wish I was that mochi
Everything is fun and games, until your grandma chokes while eating a mochi and dies.
I bet if he slapped someone that's it plan the funeral 😭😭
It's not a mistake it's a masterpiece
Monster Hunter rise dango 🍡
Looks so good
I wanna try proper mochi. Tried store bought stuff once, was terrible.
5 people died last month from eating this. Please make sure to chew well and take your time when eating this so you don't choke.
All theses damn comments and  i still dont know what it is. All i know is they beat the shit out of it.
I dont want anything that someone wets their hands and slaps around what im about to stick in my mouth. Yeah no thank you.
So so much respect for this food, the texture is always not good to me though :( Wish I liked it, there's so many things made with mochi!
Is 150 yen a lot just wondering
Omg they whooped that Mochi's ass!

Super interesting, but the Beastars opening was distracting lol. I get it though, the song is great. I choreographed to it for my dance final.
Ingredients of mochi ?
From the background music, I can see you're an intellectual
Looks exactly like how they make fufu in west coast Africa 😏
and the only mochi that I know is jimin of bts 😐🙄
It’s actually to make it chewier and better in texture- although there is some softening in the process
Is that... THE BEASTARS SEASON 2 INTRO SONG?!?!
I'm so jealous that looks SOOOOO good 🤤
Ah €3,95

Why are they so angry at it
Wtf is a mochi?..lol
Awesome!
What's mochi?
Baby yoda
This is like watching the Ice Climber twins beating the shit out of Kirby in Super Smash.
I don't like it,, maybe because I tried it just once 🥴
Kaibutsu in the background was great
Only if my local mochi was procesed like this
I've been to Japan and I saw this
I know I heard the background music somewhere (I think it was a Netflix anime series) but I just can’t remember. Can anyone confirm what anime was it?

I hate mochi cause it feels like skin
my dog named mochi: uh oh
Oh my Jimin 🥲
The mochi : ☺ The process : 👹
Looks like a mini game from Shenmue
My guy got that health, stamina, & attack boost.
Why couldn't they slap it around with gloves on too?
Just hope the hands clean covid alert
Food had to get beat up lmao

150 yen ? Bro, our mochi from my country cost only 5 or 10 cents in one mochi
I just can't hear the word "mochi" without thinking about 'Baby Mochi' 💜😀
I found it appetizing. Is it halal?
You don't need to use a copyright song like Monster to show that the video was taken in Japan
*Should we tell him* ?? 😂😂
I’m never buying grocery store mochi ever again. If it isn’t bashed and smashed by two men simultaneously with a mallet and the pure force of power from the palm, then I’m not buying it.
I remember the first reference of mochi I saw in Doraemon
So pounding is over?
Mochi is jimin
Not picking a fight with those guys
This is also how I was created.
hehe "pound"
In America how much is 1 yen
Ya im not eating that

Nope they don't pound It to make It soft, they do It to make It elastic
Poor mochi...
I hear Yaosobi in the background, if you know the song you are a g
Beating the mochi like they got black forces on

Red bean is kinda disgusting though
They were going full karate mode on that mochi wtf
How it is traditional when they are using machines???
Pounding the Mochi. Has a ring to it.
Poor baby yoda

"It comes out in perfect little circles"
My freaking favorite sweet!!!!
I remember seeing this in a hori art

You people love eating the weirdest things don't you
Looks like foofoo's cousin

Mochi is the most terrible thing I ever had.
Mochi getting pounded.  Mochi "harder daddy" Man "what?  Mochi "what?"
What's mochi 👁👄👁
Some people put seasoning in the food these guys put Kung Fu in it
Love mochi 💜
Mochi tastes awful lol

"iys not a mistake''✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
Ooh such ancient culture, very tradition! *throws it in a big ol machine*
Looks delicious!!!
Bet they have a machine to do all of that now
It's not a mistake, ✨ IT'S A MASTERPIECE ✨.
They really did wrestle food before eating it
And that's how you make a plumbus .
Katakuri looking weak as hell
Ah yes the traditional bean machine
Twiistz made the most racist comment I’ve seen and hasn’t even said sorry.
And yet, my cousin has a cat named mochi.     R.I.P. MOCHI 2021/2022
YES!  I WILL!
Who is mochi and why are they beating him
Ouh
skilla
怪物
"Its not a mistake... ITS A MASTERPIECE"
There's one of these in Syria old Demascus

Bit expensive at 96 pence
This sounds just like how they make a plumbus 🤔
I wonder if this guy works there too 😂😂
very similar to something in Nigeria they pound cooked yam to make pounded yam
I Love Japan 💚💚💚
Me vs Life
In my country the term "mochi" is used to refer to one's girlfriend, greetings from South Africa🇿🇦
When I realized it was Kaibutsu in the background I knew why I'd been recommended this short.
I was born in Okinawa and I remember learning how to make mochi like that in kindergarten.  They gathered everyone in the school and they had the mochi ready to be pounded everyone got a turn to pound the mochi while one of the sensei's pounded the mochi with the wood hammer. It was so much fun making mochi with everyone, one very memorable memory.
Now I got to Google what mochi is and why?
At this point that guy's hands have their own brain. He might be sleeping and them hands will roll the dough with perfection.
YEN MONY ???
Arthritis must be common amongst Japanese mochi makers.
I did this in Japan 👏🏿
It’s not a mistake ✨IT’S A MASTERPIECE✨
Looks like frog poo
Dedication and craftsmanship in Japan is amazing. Sadly, its the opposite here in America.
One Mochi cost like $4 here🤣
Damn $1.30 that's not bad for something that looks as good as that.
how do i apply to be the mochi ??👀
God I wish that were me
Does anyone else think off the making of the plumbus hahaha
“Once its done getting its pounding” umm..
Even Japans cooks are ninja’s
Old people sufficate on mochi.
God i wish I was mochi 😩😩
After its done getting its what👀?
So they are 1€ piece, om gonna med atleast 12 to be full. Still expensive japan 🗾 as always
The guys don't have to wear gloves but the women do
That guy did ora ora
Bro gave the mochi that 10 hit combo
It's not a mistake ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
The way he was chopping at that mochi  with his hands had some serious E Honda vibes from street fighter.
Poor green kirby
Come pls katakuri...
That's more of gluten
Ill have 1 without soy please i love my testosterone
I heard squid game theme song from their grunts
I can’t be the only one who immediately thought “ cooking mamaaa” about the mochi 😭
Mexican moms when you get an F:
What all see:  guys making tasty mochi what i see:  2 Guys litteraly killing and smashing an mochi
How much is 150 Yan comper U.S 1$
“It was only 150 yen” You know someone who doesn’t understand yen thinks that is incredibly high. Just for reference, 150 yen is a bit less then a dollar and a half.
Beat it like it owes you money
That punching to mochi is
Even Mike Tyson will lose
The japanese girl name mochi be like: O_O
I hate mochi. Taste disgusting

The second he took a bit I forgot it was Mochi and thought he was taking a big bit if Wasabi
what did the mochi do 😭
The most disgusting thing I've ever had
My sister tried mochi stuffed with ice cream and told me it tasted like raw dough and had that texture as well.
Same as syria when they make bouza or ice cream
OMG! Totally miss heard what you said.  Had my headphones on and was looking away from the phone and autoplay came to your vid.  I heard "Moji" not "mochi".  Moji is a guy's private area in Korean.  I choked laughing 🤣😂  "This is how they pound moji in Japan..."
Backsound name?
If anyone is wondering 1 yen is 0.0087$ so 150 yen is 1.305$
Me and de boys findin the grinch
What a life
My cat is called mochi 😭
This is how depressed kids are made
Gaaah I want mochi!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Baby youda
GUYS DO YOU REMEMBER THAT DORAEMON EPISODE
That mochi probably had a more tragic backstory than naruto
How does it taste? Spicy? Sweet? Sour?
I am from nara in india
150 yen thats to much candy
i had this once but i almost died from choking at it
If I did that … I would have my hands pounded for sure.
Sure we have a million better ways to do this now lol
Noooo baby yoda
Appreciate their hard work!
Nakatani Mitsuo best mochii
Wow  my dream is to fly over to Japan  😃  Really want to taste a Mochi  🤗
They must use some karate move
Just so y’all know, 150 yen is $1.30 in USD
I seen this before when are music teacher decided to play this in front of us
how much is 150¥ in USD?
Did I hear Yaosobi song in the background
150 yen = 98 INR
Rip mochi got bullied
150 yen is around $1.30
Literally the Japanese version of my dad lmao
That mochi must have insulted their mother.
Is it HALAL..😃
This is why they say jimin is built hard
Indians won't like it . Too hygienic!
Getting pounded yeah😏 This comment section is full of innuendos
This is the best alternative for child abuse apparently
YAAAAS THEY USED YOASABI KABITSU SONG INTHE BACKROUND THAT IS MY ACTUALL FAVORTIE
Looks like master Ip opened a new restaurant
Is Mochi Wasabi and if so how are you not scream in pain because of the hottest of Wasabi
Me when i catch baby Yoda

Mochi is fucking disgusting
Ohhhoo mochi ..Jimin 😇😇😇😉
Please send to me. I will pay!
I’ve working on it forever
Omg the bowl is small
I actually don’t like mochi that much but damn that looks so good
Gross... the hand slapping is absolutely pointless and just leaves sweat and skin cells all over your food.
1.30 Dollars really more pleaze
Honestly the pounding part with the hand is the hardest cuz if they make a wrong move the other person's hand could be crushed by the mallot
Fufu🤣
Why are they beating jimin mochi 🙊🥺🥺
"It's OKEH not to be OKEH (Titan cry😭❤)
Just another proof that "japanese culture" is just a pile of bullshit
Woah they must be so strong!! My hands would have already broken out
I actually saw that today when I was watching hello kitty with my niece lol
He is eating Mochi  Meanwhile Army dreaming mochi💜💜💜
Rip the mochi
Sus
they have to beat all the life out of them?
What I the fuck is a mochie..?
Mochi: great Mochi ice cream: amazing
How much is that in US currency
Do they use gloves when they use there hands?
What's 150 yan in America
Yoasobi becoming popular is wonderful
Fucking gross
God I wish I was that mochi
Beastar 2nd Seasons openint
Fun fact, pounding the mochi with your hands isnt all hand eye coordination, the noises the people make when pounding mochi is to signal each other so they each know when to do their part:)
POV you found baby yoda:
Ice Climbers vs Kirby
Do me like a mochi daddy!
But it never stop getting pounded
Can you teleport to NC USA looks soooo 👍😊
I just wanna be the nigga slapping the shit out of that rice
This is like the “Plumbus: how they do it” from Rick and morty

I would have bought much more than just 2 for 150 yen a piece
Poor Mike Wazauski...
It's so good. I just tried this for the first time a week ago. So rotten soft 🧡
I think you can make anything nice and soft with enough pounding 😏
Yum
First thing popped into my mind after reading mochi **Jimin's scared face**
Bunny dango!
Jesus Christ is returning repent!!!!
I remember eating mochi for the first time (it was from a mall here in jersey) me and my friend were dying from how bad it tasted. Did we just not eat real mochi and fake US versions?
With extra sweats
Who doesn't love pounding mochi ?
What is 150 yen worth in the U.S
How much is 150 yen ?
I’m too childish to be pounding mochi. I’d get fired the first day.   Me pounding me some mochi in broad daylight: “TELL US WHERE YOU HID THE MONEY!!! TALK YOU COCKROACH!!”
Indians do every thing the same for making rice batter and chutney  . Recipes are almost identical. Almost every Asian country have similar origin.
Secret recipe in mochi: hard earned sweat
Im not eating that with that unhygienic process
They do be pounding
"It's not a mistake"✨IT'S A MARTERPIECE✨
Always thought they were making play dough.
All that and it still generally taste like shit

Nobody cares.
I don’t know what 150 ¥is in dollars
I've always wondered where Master Yoda's corpse went after he died i have finally found all the answers to life thank you
That mochi fist pounding guy has crackhead stamina
I'd eat a whole 8000 tons of this-
They be beating they mochi
That doesn’t look like the type of hitting for cooking       It seemed like the abuse type
Feel like that one episode with Rick and Morty  (plumbus episodes)
God bless.
Mochi kills old people
When your mum is named “Mochi”.
They use Chakra
My mom when she catches me playing video games:
Poor poor mochi 😔
It likes the abuse, kinda like my ex, she wanted abuse but I’m not that kind of guy
So they literally beat the shit out of it lol.
They for real do all that for a dollar
mochi trash n feel like rubber when u chew it
Mochi so sticky and choke lol.
“Once it’s done getting it’s pounding” 😂😂😂
Try not to get the mochi pregnant
For those who don’t know 150 yen is not  close to $100
I love Japanese Mochi so much.
How much is 150 in usd
Me when I finally find Baby Yoda
AYO AYO IS THAT BEASTARS LESSS GOOOO
Damn I wish I was the mochi
Mmmmmmmmmmmmm yummy
Wow drum solo 😁
Damn I was like “why did my Spotify start playing?” Then I realized that was just part of the video
For 150 yen you could have a good meal in india
I used to think when I was little alot of stuff cost like alot of yeb because of the numbers of stuff they said that costs yen
girl with big rack passes by guy looses his hand 😂😂😂😂
Two men pounding that mochi   Just like your mom
Handboning at the ultimate level. 😂
Rip shrek
Seems like a huge waste of steps
Just me vibing to the background music
I know what all of you are thinking
Mochi and Red Bean Paste remind me of One Piece.
When it's done getting it's pounding
I know some mochis in Punjab!
I’d be afraid of hitting the person and I’d be afraid of getting my hands hit
Katakuri entered the chat
Karakuri

"They pound the mochi to make it nice and soft then they Finnish it off with their hands"   "Once the mochi is done getting it's pounding it's thrown"  💀💀💀💀💀
Wtf is mochi?

Their Hair is not covered so basically the last ingredients are Hair,,Sweats so  enjoy the Taste

Me and the boys catching the Grinch trying to steal  Christmas presents
Green Kirby noooooo
Its is disgusting with the rice powder added on. Especially in covid season.
*the 2 men pounding and slapping the the mochi* Me: this looks too familiar- *Flashback to my childhood playing cooking mama on Nintendo DS* ah ;-; ♡
It gets pounded and filled up 😫
AYYYY I KNOW THIS FUCKERR 😂😂😂. SHOTAAAAA
You eaten two? You must eat three!
“It comes out in perfect little circles.” As if the employee isn’t MAKING THEM. 😂😂
They pound that mochi like no tommorow lol 😂, then they slapp it, once it done getting pounded then you coat it with ANGERLY, good slapped and pounded mochi!!
I will now go look for that mochi smashing vid with smash bros sounds in it after subscribing of course
nothing special at this mochi
What if they ponder your Nuts like this 😳
Wearing mask but no gloves 🤡🌎
Ow
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.   Matthew 6:33 KJV..
It's not a mistake ✨ IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨.
Is this how mochi is traditionally? Only ever seen it sold in stores filled with ice cream around me
Wait till you guys learn how we Pound Mochi in the US. 😳
“Once the Mochi is done getting its pounding” 🤨⁉️
Is that a lot? I don't know cause I live in the U.S
This my friend, is Bunny Dango
I once was in Japan, and now it's still my favourite place in this world. I absolutly LOVE Mochis, and I hope I one day go back to Japan.
I'm not sure what this is is it to Desert all I know is I want to try it
Poor mochi got slapped for no reason just because…..maybe it deserved it? Maybe it’s been a naughty mochi?
Mochi abuse
Real Life Hammer Bros.
....and then they use a machine!?WTF!?
Describe the taste bro
150 is so much!
someone told me mochi tasted like old lady skin. true… but still good
When mochi is done getting their pounding  Me: That's kinda sus what you have said.
I've done this before it is so fun
Dude it's stationary. Not a miraculous hand eye coordination example. Still interesting though.
Loved this place! On a cold wintery day, found a small queue and man, warm delicious mochi
It's "mochi", not "mo uchi"!
💪🏼A MANS man 💥🤙🏼
I’d like to pound some Japanese mochi…. Also pounding the mochi is Japanese slang for sex.
Katakuri wants to know your location
I wonder what kinda story happened between the mochi and the attackers , did the mochi choke one of their family members to death
What’s Japan like at the moment ? I’m desperate to explore
Green fufu
This is the same process I used to make my kid
It's not a mistake ✨ IT'S A MASTERPIECE ✨
"it's not a mistake" ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
I want to be pounded like that mochi
Remeber that green ghost from ghost busters? He's mochi now. Feel old yet?
Too much soy bean is bad for male humans
ice climbers
I would not buy that
"it's not OKEH to be OKEH"❤(titan cry 😭)
I’m a go get that right now though
You wanna know something awesome about the Mochi making? Sometimes in American Japanese schools (as in they are in America) they have people come over and let the kids make some Mochi!
They say the violence makes it sweeter.
I wish I was done getting my pounding
Oh god, i wish that were me 😔
How Africans pound yam 🍠
What the heck is mochi?:D
found footage of the ice climbers beating Kirby
I honestly think the hitting it with hand thing is just for fun and for show.
The sheer work that goes into that food. It has to taste good.
Talk about labour intensive
Hey beastars in the background
is 150 yen expensive
I miss mochi 😭😭😭😭😍😭😭
When the guy was finishing it of with his hands he wasn't wearing gloves....
I need them to give my wife a pounding
Everyday i eat rice cake
Is the flavor machine part of the tradition as well?
Is Mochi good?
I machine can do that longer, and faster.
The guy was moving his hands real fast to essentially do nothing
Now you have ideas where you get the ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA
Arab parents would be great at this😂
That’s a whole lot of labor for a not so big payoff. If labor was money, this would be a poor return on your investment with diminishing returns.
Disgusting
Looks bland
Yoshi watching:MY CHILD
I honestly can't wait to be able to go to Japan. It's my dream to go there, and I hope that some day the opportunity opens up for me.
Why is your name shota _🤨_
Yaosobi
My name is Mochi
For those who haven’t had Mochi, it tastes like syrup. :) (I’m talking about plain Mochi.) Also it may just be me.
The yoasobi song made it so much better!!
Workers: hey hey hey hey hey
I wonder. Can they use like machines to do it? I'm not any expert in cooking or any technical stuff, do they have machine made, or those shops are more on traditional methods. 🤔
My girl makes me do this to her everyday
The video was also about moshi
"Once the mochi is done getting its pounding"  Im sorry y'all I can't control myself 💀
Dafuq is mochi?
Can’t believe Luffy taught all these people how to beat Mochi, Katakuri would be proud🤧
“When the mochi is done getting its pounding”.   Me: “no comment….”
Imagine katakuri see this
Lucky mochi
I don't think I would like mochi
I pound my sister Mochi in a completely different manner. It's crazy, these little differences between cultures.
Me when I see kirby
Fun fact : some sticky mochi kills lots of people     *Bob will return next month for ore disturbing facts*
Neither do I have the „Hentai Coordination“ for pounding a mochi that hard.
I love these
I thought mochi was a digimon
The eat a lot of things that they can just keep, too.😰
Is that... Katakuri!? 😲
150 yen sounds so much for something that small 😒 and am pretty sure machines can make it better and faster
*it’s not a mistake, ✨IT’S A MASTERPIECE✨*
Kid named Mochi: **heavy sweating**
In Doraemon there is a episode that they went to moon and saw 2 bunny 🐇🐇  doing like this
What ever kid on cod says there gonna do to your mom

Netflix: Are you still watching?  Someone’s daughter:

Ah, E.Honda slaps, that’s where they originated.
We will never forget pearl harbour ho to hell Japan

If only schools didn't teach us useless stuff half outlives

Beastars music in the back, Its actually a show i didn’t expect to love that much.
*they jumped the shit out of that green stuff*
Ooo yum! I tried Mochi Before My Mom ordered some for her bday last year! And made me try it it was Soo delicious! And even the ice cream mochi I tried it they are actually very delicious! And I wish my mom could order next year for her bday again but- she won't 😭 sad to say I'll never get to eat mochi again until I'm an adult ;-;
At first I thought they were trolling
I wish I was getting pounded
I wish I could get traditional mochi by me, its good being Judy average but I could imagine band made traditional stuff
This reminds me of that Doraemon episode
Katakuri is proud
Not me thinking of Jimin
Wth is mochi?
It's not OKEH to be OKEH ❤️ (titan cry 😭)
Don't hit my Jiminie NO!!!!
Beautiful artwork and it's hard on the body and it's beautiful when you finish your the Moshi LOL I love that your culture and your culture is very beautiful
Pounding?👀
When they get hold of baby yoda
The Moji being pounded and imagine the Moji is saying more daddy.
Mochi means here in India shoemaker or cobbler.
The first bit is what my dad does to me when I’m bad at school
Mochi Martial arts
They were going sicko mode on that
He’s doing karate on it 😂
Well we would have more cultures to appreciate had the whites not tried to colonize everything
What is mochi? What's it taste like?
Jimin: 👁👄👁💧
NOOOO THE GRINCH
machine was made for easy work
In my language mochi means tailer
Dodol
I remember seeing this on CNN in Elementary😂😂

Everyone else : Talking about the video Meanwhile my Armylink heart :  if you know you know😁😁 MOCHI🥰🥰
I need this job I'm always holding back punching my little brother in the face
There fufu
They really beating it like it owes them money
"it's not a mistake", ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
The poor Mochi, it didn't do anything but it still got a beating
I got one of these and it was $3.15 and he just said it was only $1.30
Me when i find baby yoda
Is the mochi vegan?
the amount of sweat put into that thing though
Mochi doesn’t deserve peace he been naughty

The girl named Mochi
This is the same food where gojo bought in jujutsu kaisen while itadori ate sukuna's finger
Haha this reminds me of a touhou fanime
I'm addicted to this stuff.... Not the same in the UK though. I would love to be able to see them making it!
As a Japanese it feels too normal to yell at relatives like it’s a language
Poor grinch :(
Ahh so this is what mr miyagi was taking about..wax on ,wax off
"once the mochi is done getting its pounding"  *sus*
Only 150 yen?? Isn’t that like 1 usd?

I like how Japan samurai Conquerer to A coward that makes their own cartoons
Damn i wish i was that mochi
Ayy I saw this on doraemon
Some might say "No, no more, please, end my suffering." And others might say "Yes, please daddy". I say, "delicious :)".
This video gives me Plumbus vibes from rick and morty
Jimin are you okay?? 😁
What does it taste like?
Looks delicious
These guys needa be in kunfu hustle
Shrek blood?
For those who don’t know: Yen is basically Japanese money, 150 yen is $1.50 another example: 855 is $8.55 so basically the last two digits are the cents and the numbers before that is the dollars 👍
So they basically bully the mochi to death
Is it me or was the first half sounding more like something id here from a certain website (U may bonk me for thinking that)
YOSHI NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Where's Mitsuo's headband though? It honestly doesn't feel complete if Nakatanidou doesn't have their master wearing his headband.
Katakuri got hammered
Didn’t know my dad could pound Mochi.
I don't know what 150  yen is but I think its a lot'
All fun in games till the hammer hits your ✋
All these years of Cooking Mama finally paid off...

Yaah your hurting jimin
"Carefull you might choke to death :)"                   -Japanese guy on YouTube
A litle bit bacteria from everything on it and its done
I like the girl
I want to make that I would feel so proud. Hope I can go there some day!
Looks great for taking out anger
Take the soy out of it and it will be better
Yeah i got distracted by the bgm because i know it and i listened to it many times
They try so hard to make a food yet they still kill themselves when they have a awkward/embarrassing moment in their lives
how much is 150 yen convert to US?
Is it sweet or salty what is it
*aggressive mochi slapping intensifies
Mochi abuse
Man I really wish I was mochi.
Looks like they’re pounding Yoshi
Racially motivated
i did this before, it was so fun
Buck fifty, that's so cheap and I still can't afford it
Lee sin & Jayce beat the shit of Zac
Me - hey leave my jiminshi hyung
This store looks so traditional and still so modern and good looking 🥰
Nooo Jimin is died now 😂😂😂
So this is what I was making when I accidently hit cooking mama lol

Plug the shop bro
Mochi Vs. My Meat: War of Attrition
me after i catch baby yoda
so uh ded comment but if u beat my mochi like that its gon get wicked
So this is how katakuri is made
I've heard that many elderly folks die from choking on one of these sticky food in Japan. What some find to be a delicacy, is death sentence to some. It is advised to cut them into smaller pieces before you eat it to avoid choking to death.
Looks like I really need to visit japan
Beastars opening lol
Mochi Mochi no mi
Fluffy bunny dango, they’re a tasty treat!
Definitely don’t want to get them hands from this man
Tf is mochi
Yoasobi in the background makes this so much better :3
Isn't this what the bunny over the moon makes. I want it.🌟🐰
Guys named mochi💀
I would definitely try that for it being just $1.30 in US currency.
Mochi mochi fruit ( katakuri) 😍
So that’s why when the railroads were being built they used Asians.
I see the ice men beating up green Kirby.😅
I thought only India use bare hand to process food..
POV: the Grinch is being persecuted
🤮🤮🤮🤮
🤢🤢🤢
🤢🤢🤮
If you played OSU you probably have the reaction time
I always pound my mochi at night. It really clears the head
My sister's named Mochi I don't know how I should feel about this...
They pound by hand but fill it by machine. The lazy me got tired just looking at all the effort. Hats of to all the hard work to maintain quality.
Me, a monster hunter player: *no, no, you're doing it wrong. CATS are supposed to have the hammers*
I had mochi in Japan and it’s shit, it tastes like nothing, just dough and feels like you’re eating slugs
Once the mochi gets all the pounding ...     It fall asleep.
hmm pounding..
Beastars season two music :) so good
Wait what about in the Uk is that why everyone there is with pounds and not dollars
150!!!!!
I just recently read a book titled, "I Love You So Mochi" and part of it mentions making mochi, so that's pretty cool
Me when I find baby Yoda
This is literally the life of my di-
"once the mochi is done getting it's pounding" Um.. can I get next ? 😂
I wish I got pounded like that 😫😫
Btw, the yelling also coordinated them. Since they go so fast, they alternate every yelp to prevent injuring each other.
So how do you pound emojis  Lol
That mochi owed them money.
Katakuri
Looks disgusting
ah yes a job where I can take my anger out on something and get paid
They pound it to make it nice and soft is something I wouldn’t want to say out loud
Whoops I fed this to my dog. No lie.
You know what else is incredible, yet underrated. Beastars
150 yen = $1.50 (I might be wrong lol flame me pls)
I love how they sync the hits so perfet also it looks so delicious too
Mochi getting pounded: Yameteee~~~
Once the mochi is done getting *pounded* its thrown to the side😶
Пока на уроках ты пинаешь хуи, японцы пинают мочу
in the  philippines mochi's are a bit diffirent  it's small and filled with something sweet its just like that but smal
what a good way to get out your anger
Every Japanese person is either an anime character or Japanese.      Now go on, cancel me.
Kid named mochi: 😶
Thought this video was about your mom.
🤮😷🤮😷🤮😷
Drop addie finna visit
The girl
Weab intensify
That’s really cool
So they basically beat the shit out of it?
I droped my yoshi pet anybody seen it
The song is the best part
Dang Just 150¥
“Hey I had an idea for this food I wanted to make, but I wasn’t sure how to get one part to the right consistency.”  “Oh how about we *beat the crap out of it*.
My fukn principal name in school was mochi. I absolutely loved it when I saw beating the mochi. It's been 8 years but still I don't like him at all.😆😆 Wish I could give you thousand likes for the video. 😆😆
Imagine Flightreacts smashing mochi 🤝
Poor mochi my god
The palicos in mh do it better no cap
that red bean stuff is hard to eat   love the mochi ice cream though
My dumass thought he said emojis
Reminds me of Chu Wanning and Mo Ran from ErHa
How much is 150 yen  I know yen is cheaper than dollar's so it wouldn't be $150 so it would have to be cheaper
O wish that were my ba-
This whole video sounds like a pron movie
Btw as a Japanese person, it's actually pronounced m O chi not mowchi
Okkkk I saw this in doraemon
Rename this "how to treat a misbehaving child"
That looks like a cool game
Kid named mochi
-Mate, why are you never angry? -Oh, I make mochis
Fyi. You can sometimes pound mochi yourself if you attend a Japanese festival when they carry the mobile shrine. After there's a huge heap of treats, foods and mochi pounding. Also, many people to make friends with and drink Japanese alcohol
Me when I find baby yoda
That wording is a lil... *sus*
This was me and the swim suit issues when I was 15
Just realize yen is worth way less than the American dollar so don't be like omg 150 yen that's soooo expensive it's like 1 dollor

I love micro icecream
Shity pick up line "Pound me like mochi" Or "Im gonna pound you like mochi"
Him: "This is how they traditionally pound mochi in Japan "  Jimin: **Traumatized**
No natural beating machine 🤣 once beaten goes in machine
In india mochi is known as cobbler
The only reason they really do this is for show and advertising it's not really a technique that makes any difference in the flavor of the product
I’d love working there…just beating the shit out of some good Ol Mochi
"This is how they make mochi in Japan" *shows assault*
Soyboys
B O N K BONK B O N K BONK
I know 150 yen sounds like alot but its just around 15 usd
I love the taste of mochi with random palm sweat from pounding.
Me to the slime in Minecraft:

Only a true gamer has that much eye hand coronation
150 hell no
You can see the difference in form between the 2 of them pounding it. That old guy has been doing it so long
It's not a mistake ✨it's a masterpiece ✨
Seems like alot of unnecessary waste of energy in my opinion, like I bet there are much easier ways to get the same end result no ?
it's so satisfying if i work there because you have to smash the mochi like i didn't to slime
Luffy v Katakuri
Um what is 150 yen to usd?
This scream Kimochi
Only 150 yen is around 1.30-1.20$/€/£. For a single one that doesn't seem all that cheap. Of course, I'm not saying it is not worth it, it is just not cheap.
Dang, they bullying that mochi like it owes them money.. yo chill..
"They make it nice and soft" How? By clapping it-
That old man could bludgeon my existence

Imcredible!! Never seen, joke

Me to my wife
Netflix: "are you still watching?" Someone's Mochi: "getting pounded"

Furry anime song

Jimin?
The man doing the thing with his hands: ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️ And I thought I was energetic
A real Japanese always plays yoasobi songs in their video
Why am i watching two Japanese guys with giant wooden mallets beat the living shit out of what appears to be the blob like remains of Shrek?!?...
He is fighting with his food 😁😁
The beastars intro music in the background killed me lmao.

My fatass would’ve gotten a dozen 😂 😅
The pound the mochi to glutenize the proteins to make it sticky, not soft. It’s what makes rice dessert and not just onigiri. 🍙 ^_^

Mochi like every daughter
If Baby Yoda was caught by the Empire
beastars song in the back🦘
damn wish I was that mochi
I can confirm this. I dated a girl called mochi and this pounding brings back memories.
The person who polishes the shoes in India may be called a Mochi.
*Intense*
BEAN
It's not a mistake ✨ it's a masterpiece ✨
Makes me wanna eat mochi ice cream again-
Damn only 150 yen?
Others: Mochi is good!😋 Me: The Beastars opening 2 is playing
why can’t i get pounded and filled
That background music kaibutsu (beastars S2 opening) turned me on.❤️❤️
what if the mochi has a beating kink?
What the fuck is a mochi?
I don't know why I am keep thinking about jimishi after hearing mochi 😅💜💜
Im from Seattle and I grew up eating mochi from uwajimaya. Mochi is probably my favorite food in the world. I now live in a place that doesn’t have very many Asian people so I very rarely get to eat mochi now. This makes me crave it so bad 😩 the fruit flavors are good but I would take red bean paste over fruit flavors any day
🤢🤢🤮🤮
So they Whoop it's ass with Karate then 😐 gotcha
The first thing that got in my mind after hearing mochi is our mochi jiminaa 💜💜💜💜💜(only armies will understand)
It takes 20 years to master that mochi pounding.
Shit looks nasty
What is mochi? It looks good!
Can somebody tell me how much 150yen is
E. Honda!
This guys have some vibes like that they are actually wanted to be katana sword maker but they didn't got chosen

Moutshi

Look at how they slap it 😳
Japanese Chef:"You can't cook mochi." Foreign Chef:"Why not?" Japanese Chef:"Cause you don't know Kung fu."
Imagine hitting your head with the mallet, or it accidentally crushing your hand  😭
Is it halal?
Beastars season 2 op
Saw this in Doraemon
People from west Africa that eat fufu seeing this like 🤨
Looks like too much labor to charge only $1.30. What do you think?
Do you say made with love? Or made with anger
I just learned a bunch of people die every year from eating mochi due to its stickiness...  Unfun facts
YOASOBIIIIII

Katakuri watching this proud
Gross
Apparently lots of elderly Japanese people die every year because of suffocating due to consumption of mochi
Well Michi is actually finished when you pound it and the red bean and stuff is a different type of mochi
“This’ll stop as soon as we get our money mochi”
So it's a the moon cake in Doraemon anime which is made by the bunny in moon as shown it that one episode?
You wish that was you huh?
Same process as a plumbes
Thy eat odd things.
Japan is all elaboration quality
First they take the dinglebop, and they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem.
This is what really feels like when your sibling hits you with 0.1% strength
I heard people get strangled by Mochi because it's so elastic
yESSSSS KAIBUTSU BY YOASOBI NOCIENOICENOICE

Netflix: are you still watching Someone's daughter:
*Butter Mochi Is The Best Mochi, Change My Mind..*
Never had Mochi…. can anyone tell me what it’s like, is it a snack or sweet?
Damn, soy bean a bad word for G6PD

Why do they put soy bean powder on it, instead of whey powder?
Lol I guess you can call my ex mochi... Ha... Aha... Please someone help me I'm hanging on by a thread here
Cool
I really feel Japanese people just overdramatic every shit thinking it's something special   This stupid water hand hammer move 😂👌🏻
Quincidentally this method also makes a regular old blumbis
Bro said “soy bean powder” then I dozed out.
Is it veg or has any egg or meat in int?
Everything is kungfu in japan
So I think it was 10 dollars and 50 cents
"They finish it off with their hands" What do you mean by that
Don't be fooled yall as much as I love Asian snacks red bean paste is not sweet lol. I was so hurt lol
What is Mochi?
Lol I couldn’t do it I hit my fingers while trying to hammer nails I have a broken hand for sure

Those guys are not using gloves
I have just one thought while they punched.   MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
I thought it was pounded to develop the gluten to make the chewy texture, not to make it soft
Them punching the mochi:  "Fight back! Fight back"
Their making Pokémon
*Them making mochi* My mind:- *I'm baby mochi and you're papa mochi* 😭🤚
Damn so this is how they beat there meat in China also

"Tamako market"
'Onces the Mochi's done getting it's Pounding'....I'm sorry
I’m ready to get pounded
I was just passing by this area and I wondered about the commotion. Too bad I didn't try to buy 😭
Woman: I like being spanked and pounded  Mochi guys: _so no more._
Don't like mochi
Y-yoshi?!!?
They whooped that mochi assss
So they pound mochi? ತ_ʖತ
“You need hand eye coordination to pull this off”  Slapping a ball of dough requires hand eye coordination?
Meanwhile katakuri - weakling
I just read these can be hard to chew especially for kids or the elderly. If a big piece is swallowed without being chewed properly, it can get stuck in your throat and could lead to suffocation. People die every year that way. Just an fyi...be careful!
I always like to slap it before eating it.
*Me pounding my mea-*

I need to get pounded like that
Bros eating dough with seasoning
Ah mochi from one piece
Katakuri:
Bruh why u have a song abt suicide in the background
Not to burst your bubble but those are not “perfect little circles”
Ayo that's sus the way he slaps it😳😳🤣🤣
In Philippines, they don't pound the bread, they use "Abra Kadabra, Magik"
Once he's done pounding the mochi he looks it in its teary eyes and says "who is otou-san".
Is that really how they pound it? Lol
Nobody:  Japanese people: *throws hands with food*
They look so good i wanna try one
It doesn't even taste good
ONLY 150?!?! IF AMERICA SOLD THOSE IT WOUD BE 5 BUCKS
I would be slapping nothing but myself with that speed 😂
Monster
I can imagine him threatening his kids like “sit your ass down or ima treat you like I treat mochi” 😂
150$ or 1.50 $
That’s a lot of money
To easy!
Lol that shit looks kinda fun.
“Once the mochi done getting it pounding” “To fill it up” “Then they finish it off with there hands” 📸😀
I'm just listening to beastars season 2 opening
Kids named mochi
The guy using his hands definitely sleeps like ah baby!
Poor Mike wazzoschi
Noo they slapping Yoshi 😫
“Pounding”🤨😒🧐🥴😩
Beastars 2nd op music thooo
(Song in background Is the opening to beastars season 2)
Why is everything the Japanese do so fucking intense?
Hand made.
Wow that's actually a really good deal (it's 95p)
Hammer bros from Mario live action except they struggling due to the economic circumstances so they go find work
Dang I love the beastars season 2 song
Gove me a pounding 😩
Man when he says its thrown in the machine he meant it😳😳😳😂🤣😂🤣🤣
Yea. U look like the type.of beta that be loving soy.  Soyboy
*cries* because I'm allergic to soy 🥲
Beastars intro hits
I thought you were gon a say 150 dollars
🤨
I love that beastars song
Katakuri
My first day I would smack that glass 😂
That guy must be jacked from beating the crap out of mochi for 40 years
"This is how they pound the mochi in  Japan" Jimin: 👁👄👁...*interesting*
People who make mochi strong as hell if you get hit with them hands you won't wake up to see anything your ass won't even know that you got into a fight baby
Katakuri
What's mochi?
I’m sorry I was too focused on realizing that the music in the background was from beastars.
I appreciate the music lol. Beastars is great
THE BACKGROUND MUSIC
$ 1.30 usd or € 1.14 euro or £ 0.95 brit pound
that poor mochi 😰
What does it taste like?
Well, that's how they pound everything in general lol. Two hammers and two angry Japanese men.
They just jumped the mochifucker
Imagine the workout
Thats actually not mochi lol
"after the mochi gets its pounding" 😏
That mochi got the shit slapped out of it
Similar to pounding fufu. Both are delicious
What did green Kirby do
The town to the grinch after he stole Christmas
That guy is using gentle fist 64 palms just  amazing
(￣ヘ￣）ᵁᴹᴹ
YOSHI NOOOO
150¥ per, or fer a couple?
"they pound it to make it nice and soft" that's what's she said
Ur face looks like mochi
🧢
Damn Mochi getting pounded by two men and somehow that's still less than *your mom.*
Comment someone you want to get beat like that mochi
Call me mochi
The shopkeeper went Ultra Instinct for a moment there
I don't wanna know what mochi is. I like only Kimochi
Lol all that work and that shit tastes like shit lol
These guys would survive a zombie apocalypse
Imagine being the Mochi 🥲
Imagine you slam your coworkers hands with a giant mallet 🗿
Hay, that's kinda how we make fufu in Ghana.
MCakezDownBadMan Freaky Mochi Store Sir...Sir! (Hph?) "Grab me that mochi"! But Sir you don't even work here! "Oh That's okay, ima pound it...for FREE!"!! SIR!!! "GRAB ME DAT MOCHI!!!"
Yes I am japanese
"they pound the mochi to make it nice and soft" that just doesn't make sense to me
Damn, that looks so good
Looks like OP’s mom when she’s at work.
Can't stop thinking about every 14th mochi having an old man's Knuckle hair embedded in it
All the technology and these guys still pound stuff with they arms, why?
How much is 100¥ in usd?
Waaau tooo much work for that.
I wonder how many men put their weeners inside mochi. My ex did it with wasabi. He got some inside his urethra for a week and was so scared cause he wasnt able to pee and was having panic attacks and embarrassed to go to the hospital. I dumped him and he passed away after he found out he had sepsis a week or so later. His cause of desth was undetermined but his oxygen levels were low. Idk if its related to that or him trying to get high on carbon monoxide while he had a infection in his throat.
What is Mocchi?
I thought cats make mochi
I want to like Mochi, but the texture puts me off.
ALL THAT FOR 1.30!
That Mochi reminds me of my ex she also got pounded by two men and finished with their hands on a daily basis.
Kid named mochi : 😨
katakuri's backstory
Not original but dough-mestic abuse 🤮🙃
Grogu
What does it even taste like?
Mochi?
I wanna be the guy with the hammer for a day
“It’s throw into the machine” You mean placed? No literally thrown, just yeetedw
I wish that we're my balls, wait what?!
Anyone know the song in the background
Is that the beastar theme song?? 👀
Tastes like plastic.
yeah it’s pounding
Wow you in Japan I wish I can go there😃
Mannnn I remember the first time I had this! EPIC! I also went back & ordered more!  delishh!
Imagine the muscle you could build from what the men were doing. They are building muscle and being paid for it
Why they work like a maniac
I pounded Mochi too...but it wasn't with a mallet😜
Their food has no nutrients or vitamins why do y’all think most if them have below average 🍆 sizes in their countries
Pounding?  Alright I identify as mochi now
Just 150 yen? He deserves more.
Poor Katakuri
Sorry I only like my mochi not stressed and roam free
I am 241thousandth like
Mochi of my fave good btw
Pop's got them hands
"Traditional Mochi Pounding in Japan"  The men: **beating the mochi to the end of days*  Also the men: **throws the mochi into the machine** The mochi: :'[ Edit: fixed some errors
Wtf is mochi?
I know some of Japanese people die every year because mochi is stuck in their throats
I saw this from dragon ball
I only know this from Cooking Mama 2
But what is a mochi
TIL: My ex girlfriend is a mochi
What does you mom and mochi have in common?     They can both take a pounding
Wtf is mochi
Beastars into is goated 😩
I want to be that mochi 😩
With some screaming
Its so american to put nihon music on a japanese video
What does it taste like?
holy sh
Isn’t the 150 yen like 1 or 2 dollars
That could have been the slimer from ghostbusters. Im sad now 😖
I love Mochi 😋
The mochi is me with my parents after failing an exam :')
150 yen is how much?
Yoshi, YOSHI!!!
That’s how I pound 🐱 here in the U.S
Who's mochi
lmao we do this it's so fun
I believe 150 yen is about $1.50 in American money
And all this for tasteless pieces of crap
Song is “Monster” by Yaosobi. Absolutely fire band
I bet that mochi loves getting filled after its pounding
“Once the mochi is done getting it’s pounding” 🤨📸
I love Mochi!
I want them to mochi pound my head as punishment.
I like the song choice. Kaibutsu from yoasobi is a good song. I’m happy they were able to make the song for beastars season 2 :)
Who is mochi and why are they beating them?
*Yoshi no-*
yeah i saw those cats do it every now and then
I've been here. As mochi goes, this really is one of the best. Never had it so fresh and warm before
This looks hysterical as a foreigner not understanding what's being made.
Man talk about a stress relief just imagine the mochi is the person who pissed you off that day and go to town
I saw this in shinchan
poor green ghost  from ghostbusters ☹
Their wives are really happy
So many "your mom" jokes
I wish I was mochi
Mochi mochi no mi
Reminds me of fufu
“Once the Mochi’s done getting it’s pounding” Me:WhAt🗿
NOOOOOOO BABY YODA
Idk what that is but it looks fun to make
Women: I wish my boyfriend could pound me like that 🙄  Boyfriend: He only did that cause he took the blue pill 🤦
“When the mochi is done getting it’s pounding” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's actually pretty good
Good I wish that were me
I guess the flavor was kiMOCHI! ba dum psh.
i dont eat mochi anymore cause my dad died by it
Looks like katakuri lost his observation haki
I like mochi but not red bean paste
I hear that song 👀
Beastars lmao
It's called Macha not mochi
Any mochi out there that needs a pounding?
And that's how rm and jin made jimin😂😂
That’s some workout lol
This is so stupid
U know what I pound to make it nice and soft
now me
Ironically my dog name is mochi
My emptional life is the same as that mochi.
Sounds like carbs trash
Look what they did to our boy baby yoda
How much is 150yen in pounds?
I already know someones gonna make a Sus video from the pounding bit 😔
I was thinking  about kartakori.
Can they pound my misses like they pound mochi
My gf is like mochi she sure could take a pounding
Pounding Finish it off Fill it up
Katakuri
Man I wish i that mochi😔
This is literally from a Rick and Morty episode.
Beautiful culture, once you replace this process with technology it just is not the same , the same with bread making as shown with European culture
Ahh yoasobi fan i see
My dad did same to me, I'm still soft.  Also don't choke on those, surprisingly a lot of people die eating those
This is how my ex wife would be serviced by the young massus
it's not a mistake ✨ IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
Why do I hear beastars season 2 theme in the background
150? How much is that in dollars
The noises when they hit the mochi lmao hay hay hay hay lmao 🤣
I'm actually so happy watching this skill
Elderly Japanese very commonly choke and die from Mochi
**Me watching him touch the mochi** **they give me the mochi** me: U TOUCHED MEH FOOD?!
Yoasobi. Nice taste.
This is like the making of rice cakes by the rabbits living in the moon man..brings back memories
Can someone describe the taste to me?
Yuck
Too easy
Good martial arts hahaha
Bru I sayin that's what she said all the way through this
Some random girl wishes that is her.
once my girlfrie- i mean the mochi is done with its pouding😅
$1.30 Hmmm expensive
The old man knows how to beat things lol
Covid can’t stop mochi
Isn't 150 a lot?
Someone tag jimin😂
Oooo
Mfs jumping the food
I only like vanilla bean mochi  And it’s amazing
I saw this scene in Doraemon but with rice cake..........# true Doraemon fan
Mochi is soooo good
This mochi has suffered 😒
150yen? like 10cents?!
....I'm sorry what
is that how they animated the dwarves mining in snow white
Kirby?
Always wanted to go or live in Japan 🤞🤞.
Or you know just use a machine to do it which is cleaner safer faster and doesn't demand physical labor
Looks so good!!!
I saw this thing in doraemon where two Bunny's are beating mochi 😅😅
Mmmm only 150 yen I’m hungry for mochi now
So why use a hammer and why the slaps too? I'm betting there's probably an easier way to make this seems like a ton of effort for something that doesn't seem like it sells for much
The food that I will really feel bad to not finish eating.
Even better - How they traditionly made Jimin in South Korea
$1.50 in American currency I believe
ARMY TICKET HERE 😁💜
That's only a dollar and 30 cents
*lucky I’m not their child*
if i Tried to mix mochi with my hands I wouldn't have Usable After
Using beating instead of pounding lol
Is that what u call ohagi
Katakuri
Dude send help to the mochi they get assaulted every day
Idk why but reminds me of Rick and Morty on how plumbus are made 😂
Everyone: They're beating the mochi Me: YOOO BEASTARS BACKGROUND MUSIC
This reminded me of something  . "The bunny who lives on the Moon"
I need this job included in my anger management course
*I wish those were my balls.*
Yoasobi BGM nice
Imagine your bro just crushes your fucking hand with his mallet. 🤣🤣🤣
P o u n d i ng 😩
75pesos amp
When i see mochi making, i just wanna eat it right away
よもぎかな?
I have watch this on doremon lmao 😂😂
Mowchi HAHAHAH
if some currency is like: hei, this mochi costs you 150!  I think: Hell....like 150€??? how can they *starts thinking again* oh, okay...150 there is like maby 1-3€ here...
Me wondering where have i seen this..   Me  later : oh i saw this in doreamon where the rabbits on the moon make these rice cakes.....
Come back after dark and I'll show you how we pound miss mochi
Is it sweet or salty?
You know it's good when making takes this much dedication and risking your hands. Awesome!I would like to try
What in the Japanese style.. NY style Gino's pizzeria is this! Lol he was E-honda slapping that shiz lol!
Personally I don't like mochi because it's too chewy and I feel like choking if I try too swallow it (got stuck once). The ones I've had that aren't as chewy are probably not actual mochi but I can at least eat it without worrying
When i here mochi Remembers bts jimin 💜
All of that was just a show  The machine does the actual work.              Jk
What? No ice cream?
Reason why i love japan old people
Ia it halal?
I've met a girl called mochi... Very interesting.
Mochi mochi fruit
haha looks fun.
Mochi is code for your mom
Cool
me farming slime to craft sticky pistons
Can't wait till I'm done after my pounding so I can let them finish me off with their hands
I don't like mochi plz no one hate me
Nice
I'm remembering the chickorita meme
What's the song name

So this is how *Jimin* was made 😂👍
Asians eat too much soy that’s why you look so girly

Hai
So, what is the  main ingredient to the green substance  "mochi" ?
Sheeeeeesh i wish that were my
I really wanna try this stuff.
kids raging at roblox:
Nara clan
I’m not sure but I remember them doing the mochi pounding in preschool as an event once an year
This is how all rica ke is made and this is not a japanese thing or their own authentic way. It is common in all east asia
the music of beastars in the background of the video lol
I thought that was Wasabi.
Does anyone know the title of the song used in the vid? I can't seem to find it wherever I look, been bugging me for a whole hour now
They're beating mochi like it owe them some money lol
Why are they abusing the mochi 😰😰 This is a joke don’t come for me
Thousands of old people die every year eating that crap almost as deadly as the greatest pandemic ever known to man with a 99.97% survival rate
Bruh I would just go to watch it and laugh I’m that dumb
"it's not a mistake" ✨it's a MASTERPIECE✨
Reminds me of cooking mama on the wii
"Once the mochi's done getting its pounding, it's thrown"  My girlfriend: *Don't you fucking mais dare.*
I thought it was pronounce mu-chi
*Mochi getting beaten up*  Mochi: *Ya---Yamete kudasai oneechan* 🥴"
Me who watched tamako market man i wanna watch tamako make mochi again..
Let's start a petition to force Americans to learn how to say foreign names. The way he says mochi it makes me cringe 😅😏
Reminds me of a girl i met in Japan...
Industrial mochi: HYDRAULIC PRESS 9999
Unstoppable mochi
My GF's name is Mochi and she told me to pound her like they do in Japan.
is red bean paste sweet or savory?
Looks sanitary🤔😂
Why not just use machines
$150 is too much.
When you play to work lol
150 yen when you're not from Japan: 😰 150 yen: when you're from japan: 😁
So it's 1.50€
Noo not the rayquaza
Background music : AaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAaaAAAaaaaaa
Is the battle cry necessary
Sad katakuri noises
He is liyeing they use mirchi mirchi Nonie to create that
That's really cheap just like what 1.30 dollers in US money
Isnt mochi made of rice
Monster by yoasobi
That man was like *slap slap slap*
I recognize that music in the background 👍
I would never know how good it tastes because of the soy. I'm allergic to corn
Is this the same technique used with FuFu?
"Once the mochi is done getting it's pounding." Hol' up
Yoshi, noooool
Soy bean good for women. Not real men.
I wish that mocci was me
Him saying "Mochi" What i hear : Emoji
Now I know where is karate come from.
That is 60 us cents
i’ve always wanted to try traditional mochi
Me and the boys when we find baby yoda
How to pound Mochi: What do you expect? A luxury golden cutting board with a person to massage the mochi? NO.
That grandpa is a slapper expert!
This is the one of moji that, I want to eat in my life.   Wait is that a op BEASTARS SS2.
"once the mochi is done getting its pounding ts thrown into a machine to be filled with red bean paste" interesting
Pounding Mochi must be a really good pick up line ...in Japan??🤡🤷‍♂️😂
No wonder katakuri was so strong
Omg , please save jimin
Me, visioning myself attempting the hand motion to hit the mochi: slams fist on wood not even hitting the mochi  The mochi: dude I'm not even moving
Sus
I've seen the in waffles and mochi Great series
Those bunny on the moon
Looks tasty ... want to have one ☹
Ehehehehehehehe  Katakuri got beaten again....

Ayo! Where the rabbits at?!
America: I'm gonna go beat my mean  Japan: I'm gonna go beat my mochi
Every dragon Ball fight
I love how they do karate and making food at the same time...
Imagine knocking your elbow on the wood while doing that it would knock yourself out of existence
Man.. pound town
This is Kahramanmaraş ice cream not mochi liars
Yum I just found Mochi last year and my fav is mango or green tea … I would love to get a fresh mochi yummmm
i also want to get pounded and filled up
goodluck for every one who will eat mochi remember you will possibly die if you eat it
Ha pounding 😅🤣
Now that is just disrespect full to the food i mean smashing it even tho its there tradition no hate tho im just saying
Man that poor mochi
That looks delicious
Mochi in Hindi means Cobbler
I had this over at costco the other day it was so gross i spent the next hour trying to forget its taste 🤢🤢🤢 oh look the puke emoji looks just like it...
This is a fever dream.
abuse the mochi
Me and the boys when grinch steals our presents on x-mas
“Once the Mochi is done getting it’s pounding”
Me when I work there: bop bop bop bop bop bop
Is 150 yen close to 1.50 usd
Fuck jimin is made in japan
I love mochi!
Mochi means Cobbler in Hindi(INDIA)
I came right to the comments
Vibin to the anime music bro
Poor mochi his full of wound
It's not mochi, it's an ETDAKM (Elder Torture Device And Killing Machine)
I wish there was an EXTRA dislike button! Post this shit in Japan not America
Imagine how chill Americans would be if more of our food allowed us to take out our anger on it while we cooked.
Me and the boys finally catching baby yoda.
Damn this is how you really learn Japanese Kung Fu
In hindi mochi is someone who repairs ur shoes or any other footwear.
I remember doing this in cooking mama
Touching with bare hands? Damn tradition I ain't eating that
“TELL US WHERE YOU PUT THE MONEY”
I am so fortunate to have lived in rural Japan. They would have festivals by the river. Up to three men would pound at the same type in full traditional garb. People would also through mochi from the roof of new houses to bring good luck. There's no place like it on earth. Urban Japan gets all the attention, but the countryside will always have my heart.
I wanna see a POV of being the mochi while getting hit by multiple Japanese men
🔥 🍦🤣
Similar process to FuFu!! 😂
First time I've ever heard of mochi but you sold me on it, can't wait to try some.
"Then they finish it off with their hands and a mallet"  Ayo bruh 💀
I love the beastars music In the background lol
Ima slap my pasta next time, maybe it tastes better🤣🤣
poor Kermit
wish i got pounded like that
Honestly it doesn't taste that great. It's overrated. It's what old people from 18th century would enjoy.
Is it mEaT :D
When you ask about the history they will probably tell you some Confucius shit
BRUH, I COOKED THAT IN COOKING MAMA ON THE WII TODAY😂
Istg they make this look like an olympic sport
green kirby getting beat up by ice climbers
Some women are like mochi, gets pounded really hard then gets slapped to make them even wetter 😅🤣😂
I had a dumb Freind dumb enough to eat a whole mochi and choke on that my dad was drunk he kicked in the ass and we gave him the choke relief
My favorite is green tea mochi
What’s 150yen in dollars
They might love the history of the process to get to that delicious little thing but come to United States and you'll be able to double the price up to $5. My opinion.
Who is this woman called mochi?
Arghhh that pronunciation of mochi is painful to hear 😭
plssss i wanna be pounded like that and thrown away
these mochi makers play too much first person games
The technique reminds me of Nigerians when they pound yam, the equipment and form are even similar! Love it! Brought back memories
He threw it like he wanted to quit
Me when I finally catch baby yoda     Not original...
What's sad is these fish work so hard to make a food that's barely even OK
Ah the beastars op on the background so nostalgic although it only came out in 2020
150 yen= $1.29 usd
How much is one yen worth?
Oh I love mochi
No way that’s good
Rip to slimer from ghost busters
Jiminsshhiiiiiii~💜
This why i love mochis man. Those efforts
Look, if you makes you feel that way, we'll ALL take turns pounding your mochi. But, only if we get to eat it together.
I get it you're Japanese but why do you have to do it like you filled your critical meter and are executing a power move?
I know who few girls that live up to the nick name Mochi. Pounded, slapped, thrown, filled and coated.
katakuri?
Asains turn everything into karate
Why is it so labor-intensive for so little nutritional content? It seems counterintuitive for survival and I can't understand why this would develop as a cultural staple.
MOCHI MOCHI♥️♥️
Just like pound girls😏
You don’t have the hand eye coordination to slap something…
"pound mochi"  uraraka what happened to you
Damn if I knew it took this much effort I wouldn't be eating them in one bite
sounds like you have to earn a black belt in karate 🥋 first
🤮
Ayo…
$1.29 is kinda expensive for just one
POV: the angry birds have had enough and gave the pigs a piece of their mind.
As a Japanese when I was a kid I did that (with my friend)
I feel like the mochi after work today so busy
Brings back horror memories of making Mochi hand pat challenge for cooking mama
150 dollars!?!? Jkjkjkjk ik it's basically 1 dollar 😭
“Once the mochi is done getting it’s pounding…”
Not even a thousand yen? Great
Always thought it was disgusting but it's cool how they make it
Mochi : 😏
Me with the job application: “um… I’m here to um… POUND the mochi 🤷”  The manager: “ Get Tf out rn”  Me: “ok ☹️”
I wish I was that mochi 😩😩
That looks like traditional fufu pounding
I love eating these
damn even the mochi getting more action than me 😔
…………………….
I was laughing the whole time now I feel bad
I learned the children’s song to make mochi but have since forgot most of it
*NO, THAT’S GREEN KIRBY!!*
After it’s pounding it gets filled with paste 🤤
Guy just took his anger out on that mochi by pounding it 😂
They beat the hell out of it lol
Rest in peace Yoshi lol

Monster hunter rise.

150 yen!? Thats nothimg bassicly
Who they pounding
For those were wondering how much money that would be translated to in American dollar it’s about a dollar or 2 💵
ohh is that kaibutsu music running? i love tha song 😍
This reminds me of the thing where it was two videos connected.    In one, a guy had a Chikirta pokemon plushie (im sorry if I'm butchering that), and "accidentally" threw it. Which led to the next video where that green dough fell into the bowl thing, and they started pounding it.  The guy seemed so horrified  Rip chikirta
You should try mochi ice cream👍🏼
We do somthing similar like this in our cultur too idk how to explain but my sister hit my hand really bad with that once😥
Good idea to act pretentious like they do with everything else. Wow, mashed rice with bean paste.
Green Kirby just got eleminated
"It's not a mistake, 💫ITS A MASTERPIECE💫
YOASOBI!!!
The girl named Mochi watching this:
they’re fucking jumping the thing
What does it taste like?
Katakuri is getting pounded
Yea or just use a machine that makes it better. More precise. I’ve had it done both ways. The machine way was 100000000% better.
My respect for those workers 📈 My respect when I heard Yoasobi as the background song📈📈📈📈📈 (I believe the song is: Yoru ni kakeru (Racing into the Night))
*vibing to yoasobi in the background*
Watching this makes my back hurt
Btw for anyone that wants to know 150 yen is 1.29 in America
Yeah pound that mochi
“Honey what are you doing”  “I’m just beating my mea-“    I’m just beating my mochi calm down
Imagine all the mochi under their nails every time they finish it off with their hands
That looks like long hard work they should be 10$ each! Lol  if only
Girls be like “call me mochi 😭” lmao
GIMME SOME!
December 1st be like

Katakuri moment
Don’t mind me *pretending to be mochi* 🥴🥴🥴🤤🤤🤤
Mmmmmm soybean powder
I’ve been to this place! The mochi is great
Okay... But like what's Mochi
The fact a mochi get more pounding that me is sad
That green stuff reminds me of my ex
It's all fun and games until you die from choking on the mochi
The topic being talk in the comment section as far as i read : -talking about katakuri -joking about the quote that made dirty -explaining why pounding it making it soft -wanting to go to Japan to try mochi -talking about a news about Japan Elder choke on mochi -their experience with mochi -joke about how their parents will do to them if they don't get good grade -talking about the bgm -army related comment -talking about currency convertion
People look fuckken dumb taking pics with mask on lol
I wouldn’t wanna be that Mochi…
Damn thats how my whole family used to beat my ass after I got in trouble
When u drop the kids off to ur parents and they come back disciplined affff 💀
Katakuri realy gone gone down hill
For some reason my brain thought that was Wasabi. When you went in for a bite I was internally screaming
“Once the mochi’s done it’s pounding, it gets thrown.” 😩
Me at 12 PM
What is mochi and what is it’s taste comparable too?
Mochi is delicious! I've had a ice cream type like one strawberry filling flavour but I had NO regret eating it! Bre I'm an American so it was an interesting and joyful taste to have! I love different cultural foods and sweets
me to my mochi at 3 am
Why that beastars music tho?
"are we not doing phrasing anymore?"
That looks so fun
Noooo grinch
mouchi 💀
I hope they wash there hands 😅🤣

Asian food is literally, the best type of food, especially Japanese and Chinese.
Mochi is nasty
People who know how many people die from mochi each year 👁👄👁
That looks like good exercise
Beat my mochi like that and is going to get wicked
In a alternate universe he could have been killed by that machine quite common
So much effort goes into making these perfect snacks, I really want to have mochi someday ❤️
“Thrown into the machine” me: literally
Beat the shit out of it.
Me at 3AM

My man had a anime battle with the mochi 😂
It's cool how you can see them making it
Their secretly training
That looks like such a nice job get a good workout while your at it as well

Reminds me of Monster Hunter where the cats are pounding the mochi and it stretches like 5 feet long and the other cats are playing the drums or dancing. Too cute.
I don't think I could be arsed to pound this mochi 🤣🤣
Me playing as ice climbers in smash bros against green kirby
So that’s how a plumbus is made
"Only ¥150"  Sheesh
When I saw mochi the first thing came in my mind was jimin 😂
I was born in Taiwan, and we have a lot of mochi too.  I like it with sesame and peanut powders and starch and powder sugar.  The Taiwanese way.
Damm wish I was mochi
Usually when I'm done with my pounding I'm also filled up "paste" 😂
How much is it in inr
Hand is useless  lol
stop abusing mochi😔
Once it's done getting pounded she usually smokes a cig and says well that 3 mins was great, now if we can just add to that time.
Should’ve seen what luffy did to that pos
Mochi kill more people than marijuana.
Actually that looks so much fun the way he pounds that mochi “ah yayayaya”
Sounds like a sparring session.
Rip green food he just got beatdown

All that Soy Makes a Man a Women slowly

“ you want some Mochi? Let me beat the shit out of it to make it extra soft. “
I wonder if Monkey D Luffy likes Mochi nowadays ? 🤔
Packing the ultimate bowl
They do everything so extra and aggressive..why?

Carmine: well, remember when I said I that I'll invite you for dinner when we have falafel nights again which was tonight ?  Kirk: yeah, what about tonight ?🤨  Carmine: the Mrs decided to change dinner at last minute. 😑   Kirk: oh thats cool, what's tonight grub? 😌   Carmine: ....    Kirk: 🤨🤨 Carmine?   Carmine: she...she said we're having tuna fish casserole 😫😫😫   Kirk: NOO!!  ahhhh!!! 😫   Carmine: ahhh!!! 😫   [WORK BEGINS]

Me allergic to mochis: my time has come
Noo Kirby!
Katakuri looking different
I fell in love with mochi when I tried those Trader Joe's ice cream balls. They are Delicious!!🤤🤤
NO YOSHI
Beating the hell out of it develops the gluten, same as how kneading dough does.  That’s why it’s super chewy and stretchy.
Mochi 😏✨
_once the mochis done getting its pounding._
😂😂😂😂
So this is how jimin was made
That's hell of a workout i would of quit after a day no cap.
Ohhh like when my girls done with her pounding, she gets thrown too after being filled with white bean paste…they different I think tho
As a proud white man, I'm glad to say I don't know what mochi is
the fact that YOASOBI is playing in the background always reminds me of that one YOASOBI meme
Im sorry but the way he pronounces MOUCHI-😭
Katakuri wants to have a talk with those guys
all that work just for me to eat it in one bite
God bless everyone and have a good day..
I’m just gonna say that the only thing I could talk about was jimin.😂
Anyone going to talk about how they're playing the beast Stars 2 opening
Wanna try mochi coffee
Kinds stress relieving job I need
Why they hitting it with their bare hands? Getting all kinds of germs on it
No thanks anything that's been touched with bare skin not for me don't no where his hands have been plus beating with your hands like that leaving alot of skin behind🤢
WHY DID THEY DO SHRECK LIKE THAT
Video: wow mochi is so cool Me: *vibing to the background music*
My Indian father and uncle after finding out I made my gf pregnant...
Is this what they were making in monster hunter rise at the canteen??
I hear that Yoasobi
FIGHT BACK NIGGA
I have seen this in doremon. Nobita takes a little girl to artificial moon to see rabbits do it.

For once you Japanese aren't raping the sea!!!

Beastars Theme Song
*Them working hard to make mochi* Katakuri: Pffttt

Wouldn’t it just be easier to use “8 trigrams 64 palms” and beat that things ass 😂😂😂
I wish i was that mochi
It’s so satisfying
Someone should make a show about a man made of mochi fighting a man made of rubber.
Oh yes, watching this right after the video talking about how many ppl die eating mochi- specially on new years
Fun fact: Japan celebrates their new years by making and eating mochi.  Not so fun fact: A bunch of elderly people die each time because they can't properly chew the mochi and wind up choking on it.....
Poor mochi getting eaten after being beaten😥
Now i really want to go to japan
Pure karate fuel.
I love mochi it’s so good 😊 😍😍😍
Only 1.30 usd for my Americans
Mow-chi

Mochi is from Korea
Let me acknowledge the Beastars opening ost in the background.
I used to get this coffee flavor when I was a kid it was really good
Katakuri approves
After all these centuries of tradition none of them ever accidently broke the glass of the windows with their maul hammer... true skill.
Fun fact: Mochi is one of the most dangerous food in Japan because you can choke on it if eaten too quickly.
The dude is using some anger management methods by smacking the hell out of the mochi
That guy punching it should be a boxer
Lol fuck mochi, I cannot believe people are actually so slow that they’re dying from eating it.
Dad coming home drunk like
*Wow that looks like a satisfying job for my anger issues*

This seems kinda exaggerated.
Imagine dropping the mochi
Making my way to Japan now, getting ready to be turned into mochi

This reminds of a Rick and Morty episode lol 🤣😆
Why are there anime languages everywhere in this japan thing?
"pounding makes it soft" 🥵🥵

Soy beans are so bad for you
Wishing I was mochi

The mochi "hit me harder senpie"
I recall eating one at a small shop in the city.  I though those were bland with a powdery raw dough feeling inside.   I wish I knew how to enjoy one of the these.
I’m hungry now
I regularly watch someone on pornhub named mochi... This sounds so much worse to me
It's has a weird texture
So this is what happened to katakuri after he lost
I am curious green.
my poor mochi 🤪
My guy was using the 64 palms
This sorta reminds me of that one Rick n Morty advert
first of all, kaibutsu second of all, I feel like I've been there :0
That mochi owes them money or some shit
Japanese men like the mochi like their women..... pounded by the group and abused.
With Mochi u can make unstoppable donuts
*pound the mochi*
No green Kirby!!!!! Whyy!!!!!
No wonder Katakuri is tough.
Where do I sign up to get treated like mochi?
I made mochi when I was a kid. It was fun and scary.
Katakuri must be seething with anger watching this.
I remember I saw it in Doareamon 😀
HELL YEAH JAPAN FUCK THAT GREEN FLUBBER UP 😤
Getting it’s pounding😏
The same thing can be said about the punani, sensei!!

Did I just watch an elderly Asian man beat the fuck out of the slime monster from ghost busters?
“Once the mochi is done getting its pounding” The person named mochi: 👀
Should put a sign up saying "free therapy sessions" you get to come in and throw hands at some mochii
It's ok when they pound the mochi but when I *pound the mochi* i get arrested

I'm pretty sure Slimer's dead now guys
.
I wish my bussy would get pounded like that
Beastar op make it cool bruhaha
Looks like a doughboy, but can’t really judge since I haven’t had them
Chew alot on mochi, people tend to choke on them because of their stickiness
11s
Can I pound your mochi is actually a pickup line in Japan
....I hear Kaibutsu...
It’s giving me one piece reference’s
Omg i remember that doremon episode where they make this by the same technique ❤️❤️😂😂
When it’s done being pounded it gets coated. Wow, Must be nice🤣🤣
That's why Japan lost the war
How much is 150 yen in Canadian?

Background music is monster aka beastars season 2 opening by YOASOBI. It’s hard to hear but since I’m such a big yoasobi fan I had to mention it

I’m sad, I love mochi but I hate red bean paste…

Why is Japanese food just beating the fuck out of stuff until it edible?
How much is ¥150 to dollars
My mental state while at school:
Fun fact, deaths in Japan spike in January as they traditionally eat a mochi sweet for new years and elderly people choke on it
It tastes like grass.
what a tough job. props to those guys!
And next an elderly Japanese person will choke to death on it....
What is mochi?

Me when I finally get baby yoda
They don't pound the mochi to make it soft they pound it to develop the gluten
Nice
What does it taste like ? I’ve never had it
Just like your mom. Ayoo
I would think these are the least stressed people on the planet. Beating that mochi like that, you can pretend anyone's head is in it's place and burn off all your anger and frustration!
MOCHI THRUST
Always talking about the traditional way, well what is the normal way sir hmmmm
Can.....can I try? Beating the mochi looks fun
the man at the end really said “🧍‍♂️🔨
I do this to women...they never like the slapping part tho

For anyone wondering 150 yen is about 1.29 usd ;)
Ok but mochiiiiii is so amazinggggg and I want some now
Mochi: “Pound me, daddy!!”
I bought it when I was in Japan. It's the most soft and stretchy mochi I've ever had but it's also unexpectedly sweeter than I thought it would be.
“They finish it with there hands, then when done pounding the mochi”
born of frozen winter air and mountain rains combining
Pounding ;)

Years ago, I was Navy Brat living in Okinawa. Once, there was a huge mochi demonstration at my elementary school. I remember how cool the giant mochi hammers looked! The mochi I ate from the demonstration was probably the softest and most special I’ve ever had 💛
I love this song
This is daifuku mot mochi lol

Too easy
Like African fufu
So kinda like how they do fufu..
It’s all fun and games until the workers come back home to surprise the wife’s
Everyone: **focusing on the video**  Me: **vibing at yoasobi in the bg**
Mochi is dangerous, every year thousands of people die choking on it, don't promote such a dangerous activity to your fans please, someone could get hurt
That man is a bad ass dude 😆😆
The yoasobi in the background doe 👌
What does mochi taste like...?
A good way to get temper out. Lol.
Yoasobi
I have horrible coronation. I'll end up injuring myself, or someone else.
They have wives.
This reminds me that doremon episode in which they go to moon to make rice cakes, they make it using the same method
ayo did he say pounding😳😳😳
I was SO BAD at this in Mama Mias cooking........ I always smashed the hands 😭🤚
"They pound the mochi to make it nice and soft" Said my dad
Me in bed
Oh to be mochi…
The background song tho
Imagine hitting ur hand on that wooden thing 💀💀💀💀
“Then they finish it off with their hands and the mallet” daaaaamn
It's not a mistake,✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
“Please let me go home! I wanna see my children!” “No! Keep pounding the mochi! Or else I’ll lower your payment to 2 cents!” “*sobs* yes sir..”
me uh... your mom when uhh... me when your mom... your mom when I um... your mom when we uh... yeah
If there are any Armys out there, Mochi surely reminded you of someone 😉
R.i.p baby Yoda.😔
Huh. I see clips of this spot all the time sans the glass partition. I wonder if its a covid thing or stupid tourists going beyond the line thing
Pounding mochi doesn’t make it soft, it makes it chewy because pounding starches builds gluten.
A lot of asian and black kids watching this are getting flashbacks to their childhood.
As a young child I lived in Japan for a few years (military family). My elementary school had this demonstration at my school and we got to taste different kids of mochi. It was so delicious.
bruh 150 yen for a whole bowl of mochi are kidding me
"It's not a mistake" ✨it's a masterpiece✨
Katakuri would easily make it tho.
Mochi, #1 killer among the elderly in Japan.
Isn't kinoko the word for mushroom?
"Once the mochi's done getting its pounding"      Yes... I see
So they pound it by hand but use a machine to shape n fill it up. Okaaaay...... The hand pounding is just obsolete but ok.....
Katakuri having fun
Ayo😳 It's not a mistake ✨it's a masterpiece✨
Hmm pounded, thrown, and filled up you say? ; )
Damn Mochi gets more action than me 😅😅
Gonna be honest with you, I only focused on the song
Fact: if you don't chew it enough and if it gets sick in your throat it can kill you
so expensive 150yen? My favorite ice popsicle was just 100yen 😖😖
Who can barely hear the Beastars opening?
Indian's Doraemon fan: is that rice cake...
Beastars op
While mochi is a very delicious treat, I'm ashamed to say that some Chinese makes fun of the mochi making art. Few of the people who I know of, but is not associated with after, would laugh and ridicule the art of making them.   I'm sure most of us doesn't, but with these ridiculous comments a d laws in my country... I'm not sure. Love this short though!
😲👍🏽
Mochi not mowche
Tf is a mochi
😍😋
I need that hammer or whatever that it's called to hit my friend to her senses
Poor baby yoda :(
Dang the mochi should have been a bad boy or girl
The slapping in amazing lol
That mochi is dead they beat him to death
That’s a whole mortal kombat finisher 💀
The pounding of mochi doesn't make it soft, it gives it a consistent texture.
Katakuri getting real excited right now
Don't people die all the time from eating this? These guys are super skilled tho
*"Once the mochi's done getting its pounding"* Please- this is the first time i really laughed out loud😂
I want to eat mochi it looks really good but I dont know if people sell it in turkey 😭
His back. 😭😭😭
150 yes I 1.50 right?
Chikara mochi!
What I've gathered is they beat the shit out of some poor green paste like it owed them lunch money and then proceed fill it up with red bean paste before serving it.
Is that in Nara city?
They should send dough to shaolin temple to save labor cost 🤣
Calm down dude I think he dead
pounding the mochi looks fun and stress relieving to do
Why does this look so hilarious 😂
This guy's handsome

I heard that older people sometimes choke on mochi and die because it's so chewy was it chewy for you?
Helpful Japanese User Here  150 Yen is equivalent to $1.29 US
Hentai coordination?

If I ever go there I’m definitely tipping they’re literally putting some much effort into their food
that’s a mochi pestle

I just realized that the background music was one of my favorites.
One does not simply eat mochi, you must *Jump* the *Mochi.*
Dango?!

,.,., 18k-1d Keep it up, this is great and fresh content, very rare to see nowadays, nice indeed.
The music monster by yaosobi:)
Am I the only one who realised the thrower didn’t have gloves on
😂😂😂😂😂
My step dad is jappanese so when we went to church one day we made mochi that way it takes a lot of strength
Rice: "whadididoo??! Whadididoo???"
if any of u are wondering what the song is, it's monster by yoasobi
That Mochi be getting a worst beating than me!!
Me who only listened to the beastars opening in the background
The background music is from yoasobi’s song called ‘monster’, from their album called ‘the book’
I have been to that place it is so cool!
Wish..i...was that..Mochi...AAUUUUHHHHH
What is mochi?
No wonder the food is so good* it got beat up to submission to release flavor* lol
What is mochi?
Too easy
The hand and the mallet stuff like imagine it's first time.
Prob tast like hands
The only thing i could focus on was yoasobi in the background
Katakuri
KIRBY NOOO
They must've had alot of rage stored inside them to pound on those mochis that hard
That guy is really good at slapping sht
The energy
When they are slapping the mochi, They look like E Honda from Street fighter 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Imagine accidentally putting your fingers in it while it’s pounding 💀
Imagine those dudes Getting into a street fight lol I would hate to be that person 😂😂😂
People who played monster hunter rise probably found that pounding familiar...
Everyone: look at that mochi!   Me: It's the song from Beastars Season 2 opening!
Is this like fufu ?
Are we gonna mention the beastars theme in the background music?
Imagine trying to train the new guy 🤣
$1.30 for y’all!
Hand pounding is just for Presentation Nothing but germs in the food.  Can kick it same effect...     None
*Cooking Mama flashbacks* ✨👄✨
The Beastars song in the background
I like mochi, but i don't like the sweet beans paste, the watermellon filling tastes better
That’s how rice cake is made traditionally in China I guess Asian culture is all connected ❤️❤️❤️
Is that the beastars Season 2 theme?
Ay girl, let me take you back to the hotel and I'll treat it like mochi
so thats what i was doing in cooking mama
#Mochiabuse 😔✋🏽
Kuih abuk2
Africans watching  You know want I mean

That mochi being pounded is like what my grandpa's story looked like when he was younger
Mochi tastes really good but sadly it make me feel sick :(
Some hard working men right there
Never had mochi before, but dang does it look good
I wish I could have tried machine and other stuff. I have a lot of regrets in my life.
Kaibutsu doesn't match the video
In India Mochi means cobbler
Preparation in similar to Fufu
There goes Yoshi 😭
My balls hurt watching them Hammer that
Man just up Kirby
As a person that made and sold traditional Mochi with my late grandfather, I am glad people enjoy it.   We sell the Chinese version called Mua Chee
I use to play cooking mama so seeing this reminds me of "Don't worry, mommy will help you."
# Too easy
Bro we  need some vlog of the ramen store plz
I like how I hear Yoasobi Monster song on the background
I would love to try new foods but I am a addict for chicken
if the mochi can speak.. i was pounded hard said the mochi..
Looks pretty manual when this will get automated ?
They should wear gloves whenever they touch the food. They weren't. Fail.
i hear beastars season 2 op. fire op
I'd probably eat all the mochi I could get my hands on if my teeth didn't kill me when I eat sweets
gachapin moment😳😳😳😳😳
Its all fun and games untill the mochi turns red
Jolynr and anasui if they hitted the green baby from JoJo :
Noooo baby Yodaaa
Mochi shop? Nah, this is a whole dojo.
Never tried mochi guess I gotta go to China to try it out now=/
Isnt this how you make wasabi too??
I really wish to try mochi one day. Have to find it first where I live.

This reminds me of how my grandmother makes Fufu in Ghana
My grandma lives in Nara you should check out the temple there

Yo keep it up! You are a amazing youtuber helping people like the 2$ ramen cook! You show people amazing things to cure the boredom we have!  Here’s your sub!
Ice Climbers vs Green Kirby
THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, lusted (Which Jesus said was adultery in Mt. 5-28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there’s good news, Though we broke God’s law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross. “God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes (trusts) in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (Jn. 3-16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses.  if you’ve made it this far, please, repent (turn from sin) and trust in Jesus and what he did for you on the cross. You have a promise from the God who cannot lie that he will forgive every sin you’ve committed or ever will commit and grant you everlasting life as a free gift
I can’t wait to go to Japan 🇯🇵 ❤️
There are Japanese songs other than the one you're using.
