Will Morocco be the first African team to make the semifinals?
How do you let a man jog through the defense like that in a pro game? Watch MANSAARNAULT’s breakdowns. It'll make sense.
You really start seeing patterns once you follow people like mansaarnault. That whole second half felt... directed
Worst editor
I watched this replay million times loved Ronaldo crying 😂
wow 2 years ago time flies by
Morocco conquered Iberia like it was the 700’s.
the most memorable world cup cup game ever.
Morocco is a great team. Spain is just a monster nowadays
Can someone tell me how the people from Spain and Morocco  very similar?
0:35 what a defense
O
Morocco 🇲🇦 Vs Spain 🇪🇸 Pens Sabiri 1-0 Scores Sarabia 1-0 Miss Ziyech 2-0 Scores Soler 2-0 Miss Benoun 2-0 Miss Busquets 2-0 Miss Hakimi 3-0 Scores 🇲🇦 win on pens
TRULY MADE ME HAVE A SMILE ON MY FACE LOVE THE MOROCCAN TEAM AND BOUNOU FROM IRAQ 🇮🇶
This World Cup was very fun to watch
did spain think this would be a easy win because why didn’t start mortora an the first place strange
This world cup was full of surprises! This was a big one.
4:18 "And that's saved as well!  Spain can not score!"  This line and the face on Luis Enrique completely summarizes the upset Bounou & Morocco pulled off, despite Spain having 77% possession.
Jesus Christ loves you
Why didn’t they show spains lineup?
dang this was a year ago
May Allah bless Morocco for the next World Cup
I watch this video every night before I go to sleep it’s amazing how this happen love ❤️ 🇲🇦 and  🇪🇸
Morocco did exactly what my home country did to Spain in 2002 except it was in the quarter finals
Sergio biscuits
dont think Ill ever forget this morocco run in my life time
after this spain won croatia in the nations leegue
Porque los jugadores adoptaron la pinche maña de pegarle a si como Sergio suave abajo no señores péguenle con huevos arriba.
If they had Ramos in the team, they could’ve potentially won, but the coach had different ideas
luis enrique out there wishing messi was born in spain 4:22
Morocco goalie really deserves props for this whole tournament!
❤❤😂😂😂😂❤😂😂❤😂❤😂❤😂😂❤😅😮😂😢😂😊
Congratulations to Morocco from the USA! Wonderful performance!. The goalie is definitely the man of the match. Congrats to Morocco!.
Let’s go Morocco thank you for beating Spain I don’t like Spain because they knocked out Germany and wasn’t trying to win against Japan spain are frauds
Spain is such a let down really  they have the talents n never execute especially morata
What a game 🎉🎉🎉
spain is so bad now bro they lost to russia
ICONIC AFFFFFFFFFFFF
Good morning, for the relations to June 20, 1970 with The Walker's Crawford's, Johnson's and Phillips in USA w/Laseantas K. Williams-Kyle something has gone wrong at birth I truly appreciate everyone Happy Mother's and Father's Day Months Families 🦩
That penalty shootout was one of the most special moments of the World Cup. Up until then, Morocco were regarded as a rather insignificant team in the tournament. But those goalkeeper saves changed everything and all eyes were on Morocco.  Also that commentary is legendary.
Why does the Moroccan goalie actually look like Dibu?
❤
I really think Morocco 🇲🇦 would have beaten Argentina 🇦🇷 in the final 🤦‍♂️.
I love how bono keeps smiling. Great attitude
BONO 💪
Where can I watch this full match?
I loved the energy from Morocco very cool  team and fanbase
Love to Morocco from USA🇲🇦🇺🇸
morocco >>>>>>> france
Idk why the Spain players weren’t running up as much. They just walked up then shot
Qatar WC 2022 was the best world cup ever. I have never seen such drama, surprises, and fantastic goals in the past three decades since I started watching FIFA WC. Thank you FIFA and Qatar for organizing gem of a tournament.
“And he does!!! Morocco make it! Morocco make history! And Spain are out of the World Cup!!!”  God, I love Ian Darke
BONO is a beast at goalkeeper idk how  morocco lost to France in the semifinals
As a Moroccan I will never forget those beautiful moments and tears of success ❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks Morocco! As a Mexican, I was so happy that Spain where eliminated! And I was rooting hard for y’all!
Hakimi
Oh my god “Spain cannot score!”
i wish i speak aribac
I was in the shower when this came out😂😂🎉🎉❤
España jugo mejor pero no tuvo suerte
I’m watching this right now
Moroco read Syrah fithia 😊
That smile after the busquets save 😂 😂😂 dude knew he just won them that game. What a legend!! 😂
What a penalty drama Morocco 3-0 spain on penalteys😂😅
Hakimi wasn’t doing that little dance after they lost to france😂😂😂
My goodness
Spain and Germany were absolutely trash in this world cup. Except for England, France and Croatia, all European countries are garbage..
Europe = 0 + ❌🗑️🚮👎
Go Morocco go
Morocco's goalkeeper was the MVP of the game. So proud of them advancing to the quarterfinals.
Fact Spain practiced 1000 penalties.
Biggest mistake for Enrique is NOT placing Carvajal in the starting lineup and make him play offensive game like Rrreaal Madrriiiid!!!  Dani Carvajal was supposed to CARRY this team with 5 UCL winning experience!!!!
Always moroccan fans there  the best player in the game
Let's go Morocco
I want Morocco to win
I love Morocco
Spain sux
Oh god
Came back to see this 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Think you may be lacking some attacking aggression as a team when even in the penalty shoot out you choose to pass instead of shoot on goal...
Spain does realize you have to score to win right? It’s not based on who had the most time of possession...  Even in the penalty shoot out they chose to pass instead of shoot I swear.
Spain should pass more...
Simpsons predicted this match
Cockerspaniards are OUT!
Simply amazing! From the beautiful goalie saves to the finishing goal. What dreams are made of. Congrats to Morocco, Ill be rooting for yall, millions of us will be. GL. #FIFAWorldCup #Qatar2022
dope
Morroc All the way

How are you Steve papin rex walters and wendt
Mark world cup ready to bike
Morocco has shown to us again why you never leave your house open unguardedly. Their defense is solid. Unlike Guardiola type of football, we don’t need possession, we need a win.
time a new team won the world cup
Show Morocco penalties you bums
Allah defeated Jesus
Bounou (goalkeeper) for Morocco singlehandedly won this match.
The spain team bad
Morocco  goalie stocks are really high now.
that goalie is a hero 💚 bring it home for us boys!
Soler and busquets took two of if not the actual worst penalties I've ever seen in my life. It's like they had money on morocco.. that being said morocco deserve to be in the semi
Me encanta que estos hijos de hiberdrola estén en casa.
4:35 lmao our goalie vs spains. Was he even trying??
I hope our country wins this year 🇲🇦🇲🇦
Bro the Moroccan goal keeper is insane i have never seen someone so good like that
MOROCCO FOR THE WIN!!!!!!!!!
Morocco will beat all europeans and everyone between , the Moors are back .
Most Moroccans are Sunni Muslims of Arab, Berber( Amazigh), or mixed Arab-Berber ! Morocco is an Arab nation in North Africa !
Morocco beat : France - Spain & Portugal in the wars ...Proud to be a Moroccan ❤️🇲🇦🙏
Lord...let it be CROATIA 🇭🇷 vs MOROCCO 🇲🇦 in the finals...🙏🙏🙏
Spain and Portugal played impeccably against Morocco and they still lost. NO cap I think Morocco can beat France and reach the final.
Really it's a frigging game get along with life.....
Just cannot believe it…
No clip of the missed PK call?
wth was Spain wearing these pale blue colors? They didn't look like Spain at all. It would be like France wearing yellow or England wearing green, etc. Deserved to lose just for that 😛
Paid?
VIVE LE MAROC!
They're going to have to update all the dictionaries and add the goaltenders photo for the entry under "clutch".  Wow!
Thanks to China and all the infrastructure investments done in Morocco, we can see the results.
MOROCCO WON PORTUGAL!!! 🇲🇦 ❤️
Make it two Iberian Peninsula rivals dumped out by Morocco: Portugal.
I'm tired of these dam mind game slow penalty shoots. Just send the cannon!
Estos..son los resultados.tan.stupidos.de.luis enrrike.x.tener jugadores k no dan una no lo creo k hace todavia.busket en la seleccion.esos k tiempos se hubieran marchado
Bought and paid for with oil
Hakimi 🥶
Bro if they took de gea  they would of won ngl
I am so happy Spain and Brazil are out!! Now let’s just get rid of Portugal and now we are talking. Ready for a random country to win their World Cup!  But I wasn’t Argentina to win! For Messi. If they don’t I’m rooting for Croatia or Morocco.
“I owe you an apology, I wasn’t really familiar with your game”
Bono smiles at you while he ends your season. Tough to beat that.
Great job Morocco
side of her to their advantage. I couldnt speak up for myself until my people who i thought were my friends repeatedly disrespected me.
Wow 🎉
MOROCCO
I always knew Morocco would win 🥇 the World Cup
Amazing
Wow, didn't expect Spain to use the light blue gray uniforms (their old army uniforms over 100 years ago) reminiscent of the "rayadillos" uniform.
Isreali is not gonna be happy.  Cuz u know they fans will be waving Palestinian flags again.  Expect more youtube videos despite black out from US media.
I love Morocco energy! Hakimi already a National héroe and then hitting the penguin dance unbelievable
Morocco smoked Spain!
Africa Only hope for the final...more grace..God bless
Sports betting scheme
🇸🇴🇸🇴🇸🇴 is with you
God loves you
I am so happy for my African team
It's been 500 years 👁
In the last game of Brazil, I commented they are going to lose this match.  They did as I said😁 I don't know the future, I just felt they were cocky the last match and cocky teams end losing... I'm glad I said something and did happen today.
I hope moroco win the world cup
Morocco always was a good team but they are on a different level this world cup. . Congratulations Morocco!
Love to Morocco from LA! 🇺🇸🇲🇽
Referre stole from Brazil
good job marocco
https://youtu.be/mPAY8n7DzTk
This year’s spain team kicks like little girls
I watched your video through thoroughly and when it came to the final seconds at the end i was enlightened at how that figet spinner spun
Huge props to the camera man, everything was spot on
Embarrassing
Congratulations morroco
Wow congratulations to Morocco...what a performance!
Hi fbi came cheack the neibor hood aliens strike  Went to the ground  Shot them they are rude hovering tall apartments

Go Morocco win it for Palestine 🇵🇸🇲🇦
What's such in a big rush that this highlight can't even show all the penalties kicks? If nothing else this highlight should be those, smh
🎉🎉🎉
Muy bien Marruecos 🇲🇦 felicidades 🥳
Morocco is better! No excuses.
Morocco just got lucky with spain. This spanish team is not good, let see how they do against good team like Portugal. I am from Nigeria but i am rooting for Portugal.
Wow! Either Spain choked or the game was fixed!
The Spain league sucks and this is proof.  The only big teams there are real madrid & barca and all their good strikers and midfielders are foreigners.
Was so happy to see Spain lose
Please what is that song that plays when players hit the pitch? Can't hear it clearly, it's in every highlights video, same song
Hakimi with the penguin dance 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If Morocco wins the world cup, half of Morocco is going to collapse from the riots on the streets🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Free palenstine
As an east African somali  living in the US, morocco is the only hope that we have GOGO MOROCCO. Make history. I know there’re other african nation who been where you’re but when i say make a history u know what I’m talking about.  I know u can do it with help of Alllah and  ur beliefe.
This match is for everyone who underminds underdogs..... some people undermined Japan's victory over Spain saying Spain lost on purpose.......would you still say they lost on purpose here as well.....STUPID
💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Morocco 🇲🇦all the way hopefully they make it to the Final
Settings and access ability turn on you 🙂
ان شاء الله المغرب يربح البرتغال ديما مغرب🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
it is important for Europeans to recognize and appreciate the achievements of others, rather than thinking that they are the best at football. This can help to foster greater understanding and cooperation between different cultures and regions.
Good for Morocco but those were very bad penalties. Hakimi’s is Goat’d the bravery to pull something like that. Then the hilarious waddle afterwards lol.
BRO PANENKA FOR THE WIN LMAOOO
What kind of highlights don't include the full penalty shoot out?!!
That Moroccan GoalKeeper just made himself very famous in the football world
I'm Iranian. I always have said Morocco is the most underrated team in the world. Respect to them. Even when we beat you 1-0 in 2018 WC it wasn't deserved. Morocco outplayed us and the goal was an own goal. Best of luck moving forward.
Congrats Morocco!! They did very well!!
Booorringgg….

As a Latina I was rooting for Spain but at the same time I’m so happy for Morocco! This year we need more countries outside of Europe to win the World Cup. Rooting for the underdogs!
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Bro Spanish players looked like they gave up already during the penalty
Now that my teams Mexico and Japan are out, Morocco is my favorite to win the WC. 🇲🇽🇯🇵🇲🇦
Was there a reason Fox didnt show the Morroco penalty kicks?   Because that would be an important detail to show in a highlight of a World Cup football match!!!
La arrogancia Espanola no dio para mas,!
Gooooo Morocco 🇲🇦 ♥️ Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰 ♥️
The Day 1 Man Shut Down Spain, wow, wow, wow...
It almost seems like Spain and Argentina were paid to give wins to Saudia Arabia and Morocco.
KARMA will get you one way or the other! In 2018 world cup the refree cheated Morocco out of their win against Spain. There was a handball & the refree didn't even check the VAR. That was a certain penalty & Morocco could've advanced. Now 4 years later spain were destined to lose against Morocco!
I don't understand.  Why did Morocco win when the score was 0-0?
3:22 look at this dudes legs. 😂😂
These two teams suck. Like the kinda ahit I'd see in middle school.
Idk what was a bigger upset this or costa rica beating japan
penalty shootout is missing many shots ??? what kind of sports channel is this !!!
That dance he does 😂
Why only 720p resolution?
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦❤️❤️❤️💪💪💪
They should move back the penalty line to where it's 50/50 success not 80/20
I'm traveling to Morocco in February.  I'm just trying to imagine how everyone must be going crazy there now....
Spain needs to get rid of those wimpy uniforms.   It's the reason they lost.  They need to stick to their traditional national colors of red and yellow, with options with white and black.  I guarantee they were psyched out by the way they looked!
Amazing Game!!!
As a Japanese, I want to thank Spain for taking the embarrassment away from Japan and america
Spain deserved to lose for not bringing degea and ramos
How can you show highlights and skip over penalties in the shootout? Pathetic FOX
Morocco once again proved they aren’t a pushover
Congratulations Morocco !
Spain forgot that the prime objective is to get shots on goal and score, not pass the ball 1019 times.    Idiots….
Hello from Guadalajara, Jalisco Mexico.  Morocco, great job; please continue giving your 1000%.I hope you win the world cup.🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
a game of this magnitude being settled by penalty kicks?
Morocco brought back the Italian play style to this WC.  Morocco = Italy in this WC.  Cheeers from Morocco 🙏🏻🤩
Football is passion!!!
No DeGea no Thiago they said 😂
My favorite part was when they pulled out the PALESTINIAN flag! But of course they edit it out in western television smh. #BoycottIsrael #StandWithPalestine #FreePalestine 🇵🇸🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
i watched this game live on my phone with my friend during my lit/writ class xD
We made it⚽ Congrats to all my people in Morocco and all Arabs. It was the most beautiful match. Spain did so great, as expected. Mr. Enrique was really a coach who had high norms and tolerance. He did not show any racism or hatred despite the loss. This is how sports ethics should be; this is how we would like to see players' and coaches' reactions. Sport brings us together. Let the haters off the soccer field. Good luck to Spain in 2026. Hope we pass the quarter-final on the 10th
Make room on that bandwagon please. Japan is out, Korea is out... Let's go Moroco!!!
Ok but why did they shoot the penalties all at the same time and not take turns ? That takes the entire rush away soccer* is getting stupid every time especially those video reviews the go over for the penalties 🤦‍♂️ soccer* is ruined
Spain on “woke”mode
Cameron made it to the quarter finals Morocco won't survive the next round you have to score they got lucky in the penalty shoot out
Why do you even so proud of morocco even Spain has Ronaldo Ronaldo‘s team is Spain so Spain better win😊
So proud of Morocco.
Those penalty kicks are 🗑️.....all weak shots!
Best video I ever watched 🎉
Rooting for you 🇲🇦 Morocco!!!!! From USA 🇺🇸!!! 🫡   Keep enjoying it while your doing it!
I wondered why people are hating on English commentators but why didn’t they show MOROCCOS goals🫥🫥
Repent to Jesus Christ “But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6‬:‭33‬ ‭NIV‬‬ T
No antics, no dirty plays, just hard fought football and skill from this Moroccan side.  🇲🇦  Best of luck going forward and congrats to Spain  🇪🇸 for a decent run. They have a young core and will be a force to be reckon with in the upcoming world cups.
Inshallah we will get the cup final we will meet  with Netherlands or Bresil but for sure Netherland and the cup will be in the hand of our great gaolie BOUNOU MORROCCO MORROCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE CUP IS OURS INSHALAAH GOD IS GREAT    Reply  LUIGI LUIGI 1 day ago
So many upsets this World Cup, makes it way more interesting.
yallah! yallah!
I don’t think this result is much of a surprise considering how bad of a team spain called up for the World Cup. By this I mean experience, maturity, chemistry etc…. Hats off to Morocco they played their game plan and sent spain home
Espain don't  loose ,,the one they loose is farzalona,,  to many touch like Barcelona ,on the last 3 years , Barcelona is nothing,. Xavi ,pedri ,, torres ?? Barcelona looser s
Shootout ball. PK ball.
MashaAllah Moroco
Don’t wanna be mean, but Spain had this In the bag and they fumbled hard!! The defense was good from both teams but Spain was lacking a bit, they need to be more in sync
Bono is a legend 👏👏👏👏👏👏🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Yes 🙌 good game goalkeeper deserve's alot of respect plus the whole team.
That was a case of who wanted it more
Morrocco player #21 could of end this game for Morrocco much earlier.He was just so slow and incapable to put ball in Spain net.
2 losses, one really good win, and a tie. Mixed feelings about Spain's overall performance.
Why didn't they show moroccos penalties?
If you told me that Italy wouldn’t be in this World Cup and that Spain Germany and Mexico would all be out j wouldn’t of believe you
It’s a bummer Spain lost in PKs. It does g do Justice to how well the controlled the game
Honors were even during regulation and overtime; however, Morocco held their nerves and were more resolute with their penalty kicks!!!
Is it because they are Morocco that made y’all not show there penalty kicks?
Did the Moroco player who scored the final goal do the Waddle the celebration that Jaylen Waddle for the Dolphins does after a TD.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4KjZnHk7Ns
The highlights is 1 of the worst evvveeeerree, how come u do cover over 90 min and plus in just 4 min??!!!!! U Americans made the world cup super boring and proved that u can not be professional at all qhen it comes to the #1 sport n the world.... bs.
most boring game ever in this world cup！
Morocco for the winnnn
Morocco's goalkeeper is legit. I can see them  taking out Portugal Saturday.
spain just seemed to be walking up to those penaltys. it's like they werent even trying.
Disgusting review
Disgusting review
WOW GUYS YOU SUCKKKKKKK YOUR REVIEW IS JUST SHIT YOU DIDN'T EVEN SHOW ALL THE PENALTIES  WTF I M NOT EVEN SAYING ABOUT REPLAYING DANGEROUS MOMENTS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLE WHO LAYS YOU MONEY FOR THIS NOOB JOB
So awesome for Morocco 🇲🇦
Wow from Puerto Rico

This is the wildest thing I’ve ever seen. 👀
Bro how these clowns kick right to the goal keepers lol
God loves you
moroccoooooooo
Moroccan goalkeeper single handedly took Morocco to quarter final. I wish them good luck in their up coming match.
Baldazo de agua fria para Espana, y al Cesar lo que es del Cesar, tremenda victoria para Marruecos; aunque ya mas o menos lo cante ante Japon. El problema de Espana es pasan la pelota mas de la cuenta 👍❤️. Pura Vida
Spain overrated ever since their world cup win no 🧢
hey fox please show every kick of the penalties, not just the "important" ones.
Haha jaysus Christ well I hope they go on and win the World Cup now!?!
🔥🔥🔥
4:03 Me: what stance do you call that? Morrocan Goalie: The Octopus!
Boring game.  Often it’s decided on luck.
Why not show all pens fox
I wonder if Maroccans will burn down all of Europe if they win or lose next game.
3 Crypto Billionaires 'Dying' Under Mysterious Circumstances
Nothing is impossible
Spain intentionally lost to Japan as they dont want to face Croatia and thought Morocco would be easy to defeat. They underestimated and they paid the price!!!
If you've ever been the underdog on anything, you celebrate these moments.
Moroccan Goalkeeper is best one I have seen throughout this world cup..
Imma be real Ionn even watch soccer like that but man this was some of the most flexing goalkeeeping I ever seen
Why didn’t you show the ones the Moroccans scored??
Did he save the first one, or did it just go off the post? Either way, well done and then some! Congrats 🇲🇦🇲🇦
Anyone else notice YouTube has now assigned numbers to our profile names???????????
Simply, what a wonderful Moroccan Atlas Lions are! 😊
Players from #Jungle won over players of the Garden # Joseph Borelli !!!!! Mamma Africa is proud 🇲🇦
Worse Spanish team ever and I’m African.
👏👏👏👏♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Why FoX censored Morocco’s first two goals?
Hakimi is cold for that goal and celebration
Congrats to Morocco for making it to the Quarters for the first time in their history... There are everyone's favorite underdog team(me included) to go all the way
HAAKKIIMII
Who thought that not showing all of the shots in the penalty shootout for thr highlights was a good idea?! FS1 stopped showing the freaking game so I didn't get to watch it live and now fox doesn't show it all...
I would love to see Morocco win the World Cup!  What a moment
Morocco goalie insane
Spain is down bad bad I still remember it the 2010 and 14’ World Cup man that team was hard
Spain got what they wished for. they lost to Japan so they could play Morocco .
Hats off to the Morocco goal keeper
Everyone: Goalie  FiFa: it’s called Goal keeper  Morocco 🇲🇦: Bono 👀
LEGENDARY
Allah is great
Go Marocco from Italy 🇮🇹
LOL at that!
Marocco all the way!
Morocco inshallah
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Whole time the commentators were talking down on Morocco “Morocco has been able to hang in there”  Morocco has to be careful for this deadly Spain team” even after Morocco has had better looks and overall we’re the deadly team from start to finish truth be told
Last time Iran beat Morocco lol
Let’s not forget, that the Goalie for Morocco won the 2020 Europa League with Sevilla.
Pass passes passing. . Passed
Unbelievable!! So happy for Morocco, they deserved it! They are on fire! 🔥🔥🔥
OMFG Morocco knocked out Spain
Next game Portugal 3-0 Morocco 🤷‍♂️
Congratulations morocco keep going🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦💪🏻
You have to have some BALLS OF STEEL be able to chip the keeper for the last shot to win the game in a World Cup win or go home game against the Goliath team Spain. The keeper for Morocco was an absolute unit as well. This World Cup was been enjoying to watch so far.
why don't you show the Marocco goals?
Paybacks for Spain killing so many indigenous Indians of the new world.
Hands down the most BORING game of the World Cup after Mexico v Poland 😴😴😴🥱🥱🥱
Oh well Portugal will knock out Morocco anyways
Not one for soccer, but I have to admit that was some clutch goalkeeping by Morocco
good job morocco ❤
moroco train more for next game !
Mashallah!
No one could score yet against Morocco since W.C started even in penalties 😂😂😂. That insane
…. Wow ….
Congratulations morroc respect two teams
Absolutely tremendous stuff from Morocco!! Well deserved. Great character & fortitude!
Enrique told reporters that he instructed the squad to practice 1000 penalties before flying to Qatar. They scored 0 💀💀💀
Busquets sucks at Penalties, why would Luis Enrique put him on such a huge task, should’ve started Pedri, Gavi, Ferran Torres, much better and hungrier players than old washed up Busquets. Spain deserved to lose.
اللہ اکبر اللہ اکبر و لی اللہ الحمد! Keep going till you make it to the top, my beloved Morocco!
When announcer was like I know spanish, I know where you are going 😅
We just saw the best goal keeper in the WC! Can’t wait to see who scores on him and how maybe he got more shut outs to come let’s see!
This is UNACCEPTABLE from Spain!!!!!!! Spain Shooting Penaltys like!!!!! a High School Soccer team hahhaha 😆 🤣 lol!!!!!!!
Excellent game, Morocco!!!
The worst part of Fox Soccer's awful coverage of the world cup are the video clips only being in 720p.
Morrocans need kicking training
Don’t give the goalie too much credit, the shots were kinda predictable, spain didn’t have any good experience shooters, horrible. Good game Morocco
WOOOOOW.
Good job but they will lose next match lol
fooking crazy!!
YOOOO :D SO happy for these teams... amazing keeper today!
Replay 3:54, this was the best save so far
That waddle though 😅
Just love how there’s no spoiler on the tittle or thumbnail of the videos good on you guys for us highlight only fans don’t got time to sit around and watch Futbol too busy!
Bruh I don't understand how Morocco won Spain, even though they have Ferran Torres.
Bono, absolute beast.
The World is catching up....
Luis Enrique should be sacked
I'm so happy for our brothers , Morroco is making history, we are so proud of you guys,  I was dancing carrying the morrocon flag here in Florida, USA ! although I'm an Egyptian ! We won 🇲🇦🇪🇬Congratulations.
Dude that keeper was on fire.
Good highlights. Hey everyone, make sure you watch the videos on my channel also
hakimi chip is bigger then tigres
Big up Morocco this team has a fighting spirit about them 🔥🔥
LETS  FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOO
So happy for the Moroccans. This will bring some level of humility for the spaniards not only in sports but in life too, unfortunately  in many occasions they think they are better than everyone else. Clearly not the case.
I'm so glad Fox Soccer don't have anything to do with the Premiership. Totally inadequate highlight packages for *all* games of this World Cup. They should take a lesson from NBC.
I haven't seen in a while such a bad sequence of penalty kicks. Starting with South Korea. Smh.
Bro did the waddlee💯😂
Spain was not pre informed😂
Such a great soccer game to watch 0-0 till forever, so they force a team to score cause Spain will just sit on it till the end of time
Bounou made Spain look like a team for penalty tryouts
Congratulations Morocco more love from 🇨🇲 i wish you the best in quarter finals 🙏🙏
If their is anything the world cup matches of 2022 showed was just how great some of these goalies are !
Congratulation to Morocco . The Arab Nations and all of Africa Celebrates.
So nice to see different countries making it, hope we get a new champion this year !!!!!
مش معقول..تحيز واضح من قبل المنتخب الإسباني.. أنا متأكد أن معظم الجماهير العربية تعرف يقيناً.. أن المنتخب الإسباني لم يظهر بمستواه الحقيقي مع المنتخب المغربي..لدافع سياسي واضح..نحن الجماهير العربية المتابعين لمباريات كأس العالم لكرة القدم لسنا أغبياء مطلقاً..نحن نعرف الحقيقة..!
As a German, I feel the game on the one hand as absolute satisfaction and justice towards Spain for the lousy game that they have delivered against Japan. On the other hand, Morocco absolutely deserves it when they hold their own against Spain for 120 minutes and have a goalkeeper in Bounou who is just brilliant. I still have goose bumps when I see the penalty shootout. Chapeau Morocco.👏
Um why didn’t you guys show morocco’s pk’s?
So let me gets this straight: Spain opens its doors to this family. It provides them with a life, education and the opportunity for their kids to be trained and become professional footballers in one of the best European league and how do they repay all that Spain has given them, by giving their alliance and talents to a foreign country! And this is okay!?!? Okay Europeans, keep carrying on!
Spain the best league?lol pls.
Congratulations to the people of Morocco from Iran❤️🔥🇮🇷🇲🇦
I am so happy
whats with all these weak penalty shots? Rigged 100% !!!!
Lovely 😂😂😂😂😂😂
What song is playing in the stadium in the beginning ?
I cannot believe how badly this video was edited. The match is 0-0, there are 7 total penalty shootouts, 3 penalty goals in total, and there's only one goal in this highlight reel. Are you serious?!?! Instead of the slow-motion replays or the crowd cheers we could've liked to see the other penalties too.
no way Morocco winning the next one
nooooo wayyyyyyyy deserved 👏
I bet Robby Sanchez would've saved that last pen but we'll never know
Its Morocco habibi ❤️❤️❤️
Let’s go Morocco 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Hakimis penalty hahaha in such a moment
Till now! Nobody scored against Morocco 🇲🇦 not even in penalties 🤯
Wow! Well done team Morocco!
Why aren't the first two Moroccan penalties included?
Le Maroc 🇲🇦 va devenir un cauchemar pour les supporters espagnols
I want Morocco to win the whole thing
Congrats Morocco!!! Well deserved, love frm Somalia 🇸🇴🇸🇴💙💙
To all Morocco fans they are not going to win much more lol If they don’t get smoked next they will get pooped on eventually they don’t anyone no defense or offense just luck
But, but, but, Spain has Gavi and Pedri, so called "golden boys" 😂. Many (especially Barca) fans thought that playing many games makes you "a new Iniesta" or "the next Xavi" 🤦‍♂️. Hope this will teach those fans not to overhype young players who play decently. Hope Luis Enrique will understand that being a biased coach is not a good thing.
I feel like Spain fc is like the cowboys we see them but we hope they loose every year lol
After looking at this I don't think that those penalties were on accident. The way they ran up to the ball isn't the way it's usually played. I think that there was some money and legal things behind that we might not know. But Morocco and Spain aren't really the greatest of friends and I think this could have also been a statement for peace. But the penalty shootout I had a feeling was staged. Mark me if I am wrong but does look like middle school penalties.
🇲🇦🎉🇲🇦🎉🇲🇦🎉🇲🇦🎉🇲🇦🎉🇲🇦🎉🇲🇦🎉🇲🇦🎉🇲🇦🎉🇲🇦
Bravo Maroc ❤️❤️❤️❤️
CHILLS
Trying to be too cute with the slow run ups, just smash it man!
Congrats Morocco! From Turkey.
@Foxsoccer, why do you cut out the penalty shootout?
This is way futbol is wonderful
Not a fan of Spanish team, but they played good imo, very tactical and they created many opportunities. Congrats Morocco
Hakimi is cold-hearted
So happy for Moraco
what an epic shootout, go Morocco! it's hilarious they're only showing Spain's missed PK's and the last goal  with the dance hahaha
Let's be honest. This was not the tikki takka Spain of old.
Wow, just wow.  Really liked his penguin dance celebration there at the end.
The little Moroccan dance by Hakimi after he scored the goal was hilarious 😂
120 minutes and the score is 0-0. what does that say? that both teams are lousy, there is not a single player who can score  a goal. the skill level is subpar. i don't see why so many are excited about this boring match whose outcome was decided  on penalty kicks.
i love you full marocco 😍🥰😘
i love you full marocco
i love you maroko 🥰😍😘
Morocco is an example of giant of Africa. I get mad when people keep mistakenly saying is Nigeria. Actually Nigeria is zoo of Africa not giant. Go Morocco & God bless Biafra!!
IAM ITALIAN BUT I ALSO I AM A FAN OF A GOOD SOCCER GAMES TO WATCH. I ENJOY THE TRILL.
Absolutely insane!!!!!
Nah that last pen was cold
winning by penalties is absolute farce to judge an entire nation for footballing capabilities, when knock out matches end in a draw they should judge the winner by shots on target, number of successful passes, crosses and least number of fouls, prepare a complex formula which encompasses every aspect of the game played in the 90 minutes, that team is the real winner, not this coin toss like penalty.
congratulations to Morocco from 🇲🇨
Enrique had planned it perfectly. Throw the game against Japan, therefore eliminate Germany, avoid Brazil in the quarterfinal and take a rest against Morocco.
This man shipped the ball right in the middle ending spain. LEGENDARY!!!! The little penguin dance was the cherry on top
Spain threw the game
In Europe, I want Portugal or Croatia to win it. In South America, I want Argentina to win it. But above all, I want Morocco to win it all.
Yeah. Keep playing boring tiki taka … finally you get what you deserve for turning the beautiful game into a boring grind!!!
Casa Blanca -)
Is that a lady Gaga song?
Morocco goalkeeper ez clap 👏
1. Holanda Elimina A Argentina 2. Croacia Elimina A Francia 3. Portugal Elimina A Marruecos 4. Inglaterra Elimina A Francia. Amén.
David against goliath, congratulations Morocco, great victory🎉🎉🎉🎉
And I watched the Portugal vs Switzerland game thinking that was going to be more competitive 🤦🏾‍♂️
Y nosotros los mexicanos, comiendo camote
spanish players were shitting themselves going up to take those penalties
Makes sense to have the game at Education Stadium because Morocco gave Spain a master class
The chef they talked about finding at 27:54 ended up being my daddy
Moroccos Goalkeeper is a WIZARD  👏👏👏👏👏🥶🧙🏽‍♂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That’s insane how a super team 😂$$$$$$😂 lost i love to se losers like that i hope they learn the lesson instead of buying expensive players they worry about making good players.
First of all congratulations to Morocco our only African flag bearer still standing, proud of you, a little sad for Spain considering the promise shown after the first game,the only silver lining for them is that this squad is full of so many young players with huge potential,keep your heads up
I 💀 uncle Miguel next 4 down he’s my test  Don’t talk to my sister Jess !
I 💀 uncle Miguel next 4 down he’s my test  Don’t talk to my sister Jess !
stuff of fairy tales, Morocco ! Major respect from the U.S. ✌
Great job Morocco 🇲🇦 from Afghanistan 🇦🇫
Awesome Morocco. Keep fighting hard guys. !!!
اسپانیا به خاطر برخورد نکردن با کروواسی به ژاپن باخت تا المان حذف شود لعنت به اسپانیا نامرد
SPEED GOT MORE VIEWS THAN THIS LOL. MURDERED THIS
Without that goalkeeper, Morocco would have been eliminated.
They're African if they fail, but Arabic or Caucasian if they succeed 😂😂😂
Really stupid highlights. Moroccan penalty kicks not shown????
Not showing all one by one  How stupid this highlight 😡😡😡😡
Why not show Morocco goals ?!
Dude, shout out to all the goal keepers.
Anyone thinking Morocco can make it to the final is SERIOUSLY joking... are you for real? Spain is known to play very inconsistently (e.g. against Russia in 2018). Portugal, on the other hand, is much more consistent, and with today's results (even without Ronaldo) showed how dreadful it really is to meet them. I am not even talking about France. Today was arguably one of the worst matches that Spain ever played (reminds of Confederations Cup final of 2013), the way they played today has nothing to do with how well Morocco played. There were numerous tactical mistakes in Moroccan team, mistakes that they will pay for severely come the game against Portugal. I see Morroco team as a Costa Rico team back in 2014, or South Korea team in 2002. They all had their moments, but to compare them against consistent and well-equipped teams is not being coherent. They will get slapped by Portugal. And no, there won't be penalty shootouts.
WHY TF CANT WE SEE ALL THE PENALTIES MFs …THESE PPL HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO HIGHLIGHTS TO SAVE THEIR LIFE …can yall j hire one of us to show u ??? ffs
France Brazil World Cup final will be fun !
Do you know the Lord Jesus ? Do you know His love for you? Jesus see your scares.. He knows your pain and hurt. Whether your scares are physical, mental, emotional,spiritual. You may have been hurt by people at church before. But I want you to Know God see all of your hurt and know all of your pain. And he wants to set you free.. He wants to show you who he truly is. He wants to replace your loneliness hurt burdens with His Love Joy Hope Peace And Rest. In order for Him to be able to do that you need to be saved we are saved by the Gospel which is that He died for our sins was burried and rose Again the third day. You have to truly believe it in your heart. After believing in the Gospel which we are saved through turn away from our sins even if it’s a hard sin your struggling with Jesus will help you and guide you. Jesus is a graceful loving God. 💕   1 Corinthian 15:1-4   Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
Shooting the penalties like women's national team
Real Madrid would win the world cu🙃
I’m so happy for my Muslim brothers ❤
Why not show Moroccan penalties??????l
holy sh*t Morocco!! Well done!!
watched this only cuz i saw the 3-0 shootout score and couldn't believe a team like spain could put up a goose egg in a shootout. wow. they really did...
Why not show every kick of the penalties in this highlight?
Spain really said nah we ain’t playing today
SCENES
So very happy and proud of our brothers from Morocco. That’s what playing as a team means. And the keeper….. that’s world class. Beautiful! Love the word cup!  Let’s imagine if all the world political conflicts could be solved by playing soccer?
muy buen juego marruecos
😂 bye bye Spain 🇪🇸
I number when i was little kid in Morocco i wanted To be a goalie i use to dive on the gravel i didn't care if I get cut go Morocco 🇲🇦
Awesome such amazing entertaining match
Spain has many great players but this team players are not famous except Morata, who is not that great in premier league.  He is not a SOLID TOP player like his decessor.
So proud of Morocco. Much love from Iraq 🇲🇦❤️🇮🇶
Yassine Bonu put on a masterclass!!!!!!!!
Who is putting these highlights together?! Don’t even bother to show the Spanish lineup, cuts off commentary mid-sentence, and then only shows the Spanish penalty kicks! 😂  A blind and deaf monkey could’ve done a better job LMAO
Wow, the video editor is definitely a Spanish supporter and couldn't show Morocco's penalty kicks.
ziyech is very good! I know he is good, but get less chance in Chelsea.
Ese alba mas pecho frío que nada
why did they skip the first 2 morocco pk goals?
Great goalie! also the commentator is hilarious. "I know where you're going, I speak Spanish"
that keeper is the man!!
I am from brazil and i dont mind we losing as long as argentina doesnt win. B nice to see morocco or portugal win 😆
Im so happy an underdog is making history
Gold gloves!
There's been some truly terrible finishing this World Cup. Players one on one with the goalie and kick it straight to the keeper.
Nice job skipping over the Morocco PK goals in the video
Mashallah!
How can you not show all the penalty kicks in a highlight??
Crying tears of joy for Morocco. Sky's the limit for my North African brothers. Congratulations to the goalkeeper for saving those goals.
Morocco on that gang shiii
I hope they do it to Portugal as well!
They look gooood, congrats!
스페인 stupid
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Morocco! Morocco! Morocco!
🔥 New flavor for the WC. 🇲🇦 unbelievable.
It’s even more crazier the fact that Hakimi was born in Madrid 🥶🥶
These guys don't even upload the full penalty shootouts.
Unbelievable.
Pewds : "Whoa
If you are going to show highlights of a game that ends in penalties why not show all the penalties? Fox is clueless!
Lol
Nope..I did not see that coming.
Congrats Morocco!!! This has been an amazing World Cup!!!! All kinds of twists and turns!! Luv my Espana!! But y’all did well!! Hope to see u on the field!! 🇧🇷❤
Hahahaha
English continues to be the most boring commentary year after year 😴
Morroco is representing 54 countries of Africa , not only Morocco's people.  Good luck!  from Ethiopia.
This game gave me chills.
why didn't they show the Moroco goals?
Congratulations 🎉🎊🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈Morocco !!! I hope you would win the win the Cup !!!!⚽⚽ 🏆
unbelievable.. good job morocco
LOBILLOS MUSICAL DE DURANGO.
4:20 that grin
Balls of steel to go for panenka from Hakimi.
🇲🇦♥️🇾🇪حبي للمغرب
Congrats to my Morocan Brothers and Sisters
The only team representing the whole continent of AFRICA.
I’m so happy for them, I’m so tired of seeing the same teams on the semi finals.
Did Spain get paid for those terrible penalties?
Congratulations to Morocco!!! Y’all deserve that win!! B
what just happend how in earth spain played that bad ...i was spain supporter  but I cheers still well good old morocco first Muslim African country to go final.. yayyyyy
4:32 We already have the Golden Ball and Glove winner. That guy. That's the guy I want on my team. Neil Young  once said "I don't want a band that's perfect and boring every night, I want a band that has horrible nights. Because they also can hit the highest highs on any given night." That man hit the highest of highs today.
Stop saying Africa, how far is Morocco from Europe?
i dont care how good the goalie is, thats unacceptable to miss that many
Sarabia hit both posts today.
So glad Morocco is going through. It was a tight game. Loved the match.
Spain played better, they deserve to win but unfortunately, it’s hard to play against those teams who play just in the back defending all game
Hats off to MOR. Kept their cool & such impressive defending.
Spain: *Suck at penalties* England: Welcome to our world.
why dont they just shoot in the middle
Hoping they can do the same against Portugal 👏🏼🤞🏼
The goal keeper is the 👑
Morrocoo what a team ❤️❤️
Amazing game, and surprise ending
That celebration from Hakimi was for Sergio Ramos, Spain deserves to lose that for not taking Thiago, De Gea, and Sergio
En honor a Sergio Ramos celebrando el gol….siempre lo dije la soberbia no deja nada bueno…el gra Luis Enrique.jajajaja jajajaja
Should be a good party at Rick's tonight...😎
الف مليار مبروك لمنتخب المغرب الشقيق الفوز التاريخي على اسبانيا، وعقبال تحرير سبتة ومليلة المحتلة. شرفتوا العرب كلهم
Hey FOX, maybe include all of the penalties in the highlights video. Why skip the first 2 scored by Morocco? Is there a cap on the video length?
this is the cleanest game i've ever seen...
Spanish are paying like 80 years old. They are losing ground to Portugal football completely
I am just bubbling with joy that he peneklaed (sp) for the win
Huge respect, Shouting out from Mexico , Morocco you guys are doing amazing!! Goalkeeper is the MVP!!
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🇲🇦🇲🇦
What a shocker…
All credit goes to Yassine Bounou [Bono] . Morocco becomes  first Arabic speaking country to enter World cup football  quarter final . congratulations ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡.
why not just show the full shootout
It's 2022 and we cant even get 1080p.
This is why I love soccer! Wow!! Morocco 🇲🇦
the spain team was definitley paid off
Go Morocco, much love from Nigeria 🇳🇬
God bless Morrocco for making African proud
👍
Goalie definitely carried
The goalie said : NO
Good 😛
Who like this.
الله الله الله عليكم يا نسور
Wow
That little shimmy Bono does on his penalties has got to absolutely ruin the kick taker's plans. He owned them completely.
Can't help but smile at this result 😁🙂🤣🤣🤣
How hard is it to include ALL of the penalty kicks in the highlight? For any match that goes to penalties, include every kick. It diminishes the suspense of the shootout when you don’t. Frustrating.
Man did a penguin celebration 😂
Unreal game! 🎉
Rip Spain
Morocco !!! everyone is behind you, YEEES you can.
Sigh…
Morocco !!! everyone is behind you, Yes you can.
Wow Spain out
Money talks
Spain isn't what it used to be, there too delicate and not aggressive enough. Congrats to Morocco!
Anybody know the song that plays in the beginning? It ends at  0:17 of the video
you cant go wrong with hard placed shot. All these tricky lazy shots dont work
i have no doubt morocco will go to semi final. they have strong team.
hahaha, bye bye spanials....!!! vamos vamos go home andaleeeeee...! greetings from germany!!!! hahahahahahaha
Embarrassing 😄😄😄😄
Spain deserve to loose. Morrocoo  played very good
This is why I don't respect americans and football. It's the world cup. The biggest show in the world. Why on earth for the highlights of a big knockout game are you skipping the penalties???
Whoever runs this youtube channel should be ashamed of themselves. This is the worst coverage of 'highlights' I've ever seen. Videos can be longer then 5  mins you know. You don't show half the stuff. Fox are a joke
Wow Moroccco, I am proud of you
Hasta la próxima jajajajaja 🤣
1:05 that jump tho 😮😂
That goalie is insane. He got me excited when he got 2 saves. Spain was so dominant in the beginning. Thought Spain could’ve gotten this win. This shows that anything can happen in this World Cup. The question now Argentina v Portugal finals??👀 anything can happen
Felicitaciones Marruecos.
الحمدلله
The worst OT kicks ever by Spain
GO MOROCCO!!!  holy... awesome.
morocco got carried by the goalie
Morocco 🇲🇦 what a performance,, absolutely fenominal
Great game. Can't wait for the final. Remember us 4 current fashion trend and style.
4:01 "And Bono living rent free in Soler's head there" I cringed so hard lol
“Verily we granted you a clear-cut victory” Surah Al Fath
Enrique: I prefer Unai Simon over De Gea cuz he's better with feet. Really?
European teams are a lot weaker than most people have thought.
In your face hezpañolitos!!! In your face!!! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 I told you!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Way to goooo Moroccooo!!!!!! May Allah grant you the best always!
Big sorpraise
As a Mexican/American from Texas rooting For Morocco!!
Great game. Can't wait for the final. For current fashion trend and style, visit: mjswardrobe
I’m glad Spain got knocked out. They left too many valuable players outta the WC roster
Goal keeper from Morocco was powerful.
So the "alleged" Spanish plan of losing to Japan to get Morocco rather than Croatia backfired big time. When your center forward is the fraud Morata, this is what happens, lol
We love an underdog story!!!!
Great game 🇲🇦 morocco
Spain didn’t take Sergio Ramos to the WC but had Rodri playing CB 😂
Great news, God will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more, there will no longer be any mourning, crying, or pain Revelation 21:4 Please think about it, believe in God's son Jesus & repent, he died for you. Love y'all
Good job Morocco! Spain was very sloppy... Got some improving to do.
They got paid for those missed penalties shots Hahaha Spanish
so glad the colonizer lost!
all that talent to not make a single penaltie
The world cup is Moroccan Inshallah.
This World Cup is full of surprises! Congrats to Morocco 🇲🇦
So when do the riots in Madrid start?
i love the disrespect panenka LMAOOOO
You guys seriously not going to show all the PKs? There's only 6 of them!!
I am of Mexican descent I'm rooting for you Morocco versus France😎👍🏼
Spain was my top favorite for this World Cup. Sadly they lost. Morocco did their part congrats to them.
where is morocco?
Why not the final and win the whole thing? Or do you think it is a long shot ?
Congrats to Morocco 🇲🇦  Love from Iran 🇮🇷   Also thank you Spain for such a wonderful run in this World Cup . ❤
Best tournament ever!
Ahah, spain loosers)
Bono become the Savior for Morocco in the World Cup!
Absolute madness... esp with that cheeky af PK. WOW.
Congratulations Morocco, but truthfully Spain played much better. Good luck Morocco!!
WOW.. Brave team those Moroccans
un portero asi lo necesita cruz azul, NO la nena o como se llame esa ingadera
We are Africa...go Morocco....we will win the world cup.
It’s sad to see Spain out of the World Cup this year, but I’m also glad that there could be an African team in the semi finals. This years World Cup is very historical.
He hit the Waddle on them too
We should getting 10 min highlights with full penalty kicks, this is just pathetic
Didn’t Luis enrique said he had the team practice 1000 penalty kicks?
congrats to Morocco!
That goalkeeper had the game of his life! Even before the penalties, he was saving all kinds of crazy stuff.
Japan and Spain both knocked out on PK's thanks to tremendous performances from opposing GKs. But both losing sides kept shooting low, making it easier for the goalie to make those saves. Japan did it yesterday, Spain did it today.   NOBODY wants to go top-bin
At 2:05, I am surprised that no other Spain players rush into Box. Olmo should have rushed into the small box and Pedri should have reached the big box.  They had about 2-3 seconds but they've all wasted.  This scenario have happened multiple times in this game. I think that's one of reasons why Spain don't any goal.
why dont they show they whole pen shoot out
Spain gave that game away . This whole cup is fixed . Argentia vs Portugal will draw so much marketing and money smh 🤦‍♂️
Asians & Africans looking like tanks in this World Cup!
DIMA DIMA DIMA
Unbelievable… Unbelievable….well done 🇲🇦
Espana playing Excellent TOO !!! Penalty kick Always surprising !!!!💚💚💚💚🤍🤍🤍🤍❤️❤️❤️❤️🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷
like
Well done Morocco 👍🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿💖
Viva España 🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸
Beautiful Morocco 🇲🇦 I hope you guys win the World Cup I wish you luck
Good for the little guy
I love it
Now that my beloved USA is out, I think I know what team will be my team for the rest of the tournament. What an incredible thrilling match from the prospective of a casual observer. Loved every second of it.
Fier de vous !!!!
Why are all the highlight videos 5 minutes in length?  Good content gets cut out and makes these a let down to watch.
MashALLAH
as a big  morocoo fan me and my buddy vicktor have always rooted for them, wish them luck in the quarter finals.🇲🇦🎉
This is for the Umayyad caliphate lol
Lmao
These Highlights suck.
Go Africa !!! Morocco will make it to semi finals
Africa. Arabs. Amazigh. Islam. Immigration. Migration. Multicultural. Multilingual. Pride. ❤️ Love.
I can't believe it
What the FUKC  happened to  Spaniards?  They kicked the ball during penalty shots like they are seven-year-olds!?
I had said before I thought it would end up Eng v Spa. Congratulations to Morocco. Knocking Spain out. This is a great WC full of great moments. More to come.
@Foxsoccer why don't you show the whole shootout? Morocco's first penalties not "highlights"? Ffs
Spain played well and Morocco played well. Spain defense and midfield looked solid, lacking killer finish at the front. Marocco played outstanding and very confident, nobody no gonna tell their getting thru wasn’t deserved.
Spain forgot to wear their winning kits 😂😂 my god those are awful compared to their classic gold, red and blue
Spain choked again
Your highlights are trash. Couldn’t even show full penalty kicks.
Do you want to have a relationship with someone who loves you beyond any other love. Someone who sacrificed himself for you and everyone on this Earth the one who created the heavens and the Earth be creator of everything do you want to be saved Do you want eternal life with peace and joy forever your answer is Jesus if you do not know who Jesus is read the following Jesus is the Son of God that came to this Earth to save the people of their sins. when God-created Earth sin same came into Earth and tempted Eve(The first woman) to eat the fruit that God had forbidden her and Adam to not eat. If they do, they will die. Not immediately  but death is certain. Eve ate the fruit and gave Adam some to eat as well. And he did. That showed that humans are sinners and not perfect. That is why Jesus came to Earth to save humans of their sins. Which leads to a relationship with God(the main reason) and eternal life. He did that by dieing on the cross. 3 days later he resurrected. The story of Jesus is beautiful. If you do not already have a Bible, purchase one. If you do not have the money, pray to God about you wanting a Bible and if he could please provide one for you. Thus does not mean a Bible will come from the sky and land on your hands. Pray to God everyday. But to not be blabbering that just say a bunch words to try to impress and show off to other people or to impress God. A few words out of the heart is better than saying a bunch words to impress and not mean. This does not mean praying long prayers is bad. Acts 16:31 They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved- you and your household." H Jesus Loves his Children ❤️
Estoy un poco Triste ya Que ah perdido España, pero me alegro por marruecos muy buen jugado y mucha suerte 🇲🇽🤝🇲🇦
The next game might be tough I mean they are going against portugal
Bofun is nasty had em dancing😂
When you beat the statistics
I’m from the us and I’m rooting for Morocco 🇲🇦
Congratulations to all Morocco team you deserve this victory  🇨🇴 🇲🇦 Auuuuuuuuuuu
Morocco plays very well, they were unlucky in the previous world cup. They did great revenge against Spain, bye bye Spain
🔥 🔥 ⚽️ 🏟
We consider ourselves more European rather than African because of our location.  African is assumed to be black and the northern countries are not.
Very cheap win!
So happy for Morocco 🇲🇦🙌🏾
Cuando te dejas ganar para evitar a los grandes. Y te encuentras con un gigante.
Veryyyyyy nice good job Morocco 🇲🇦
Mind blown Japan and Spain forgot how to kick penalties.. 🫣
They should do away w these penalty shots..just play overtime sudden death ..whoever score first win..substitutions as many as each team want ..play till score no time limit
The Spaniards kicked the penalties like little girls. Plus, their playing style sucks. Good thing they were eliminated. Ha-ha-ha 🤣🤣🤣
Iam Egyptian, I just wanted an African team to make it far Morocco giving me that hope ❤
Este equipo no participaba desde 1986 , y ahora ya se fue al quinto partido, y en Mexico estábamos desde cuando queriendo ir al quinto partido y ahora ya ni al cuarto llegamos😢.
The greatest performance of Moroccan goal keeper against penalty kicks in history of WC, even very experienced and talented Spain penalty kickers could’t score one goal.
😂😂😂😂 Espanha tchau Espanha tchau Espanha tchau  🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Portugal se los va a comer vivid…
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Spain's mistake all through was trying to walk the ball through the tight morrocan defence. They had possessions most of the time, they should have taken good shots from outside the box. Congrats Morocco.
What Morocco did is just incredible. I wish them the best of luck and hope to see them in semi final.
Spain turned into England with them penalty kicks 😭  Morocco balling like it’s the final 💀  Can’t wait for them to go against Portugal biggest test for both of them
Have to remind people. Morocca is an African team
By FAR this has been the best World Cup! Unbelievable games and stories. This is the first time in history where ANY team has a chance to win any game !!!
😂😂😂
Very happy for Morocco 💯✌🏼
Yah in Morocco we speak Spanish 😂 like we do in Spain 🇪🇸 in California 🇺🇸 in Mexico 🇲🇽 , we also speak Berber Arab , French, English , Dutch, Morocco is The Wold baby 😁
Hakimi scored !!!!!!
When Busquets  failed  the shot, I laughed hard in happiness. Finally, Karma was happened.
🎉❤🎉
That goalie is beast
That was awesome!
I didn't think I'd ever see a worse performance in a penalty shootout than Japan...   My God... Spain that was pathetic
What is going on here?
love underdog... go morocco!
Adios Spain hasta luego
Clearly whoever edited this hates Morocco didn’t bother showing all Morocco’s penalties
Love the underdogs!  Go Morocco! 🇲🇦
who knew group E was the 'easy' one? haha I wish my team were in it.
Why was none of Morocco penalty shown except the last one?
Whats so great about this? Anybody can beat Spain by parking the bus and defending with 11 in the box in hopes to get lucky on penalties. Russia did it, Switzerland tried, and Italy succeeded. And now Morocco, too. It's more impressive to actually take the match to the opponent and beat them.
So u subbed in Williams then sub him out for someone that miss during the game and missed a penalty....made no sense ...let these youths miss!...could never say u brought him on to take a penalty cause he missed! So why sub the sub when the game is basically over ....he was playing positive and good!
De Gea could’ve block all those PK’s 😂
Loooooosers
I don’t understand why the highlights are so garbage, like at least show all of the penalties ffs
I am going to call the final: France vs. Brazil. Lets see If my prediction is correct......
I love this World Cup. 😭😭😭
Chedira is a just an worse morata
Keeper is a stud
What kind of highlights is this? Didn't even show MAR's first 2 goals.  Come on FOX is the the best you can do? Totally miss the meaning of highlights
My hunch was Morocco might advance but I didn't expect it to go to penalties nor it be this embarrassing. Missed 3. Ouch
Spanish people live in Spain but the s is silent
Congratulations Morocco from Mexico 🇲🇽
What a great game! Congratulations to Morocco! 🇲🇦💜
Now we gotta plan for Portugal defeat 👏🏾
Spain absolutely tried not their best . You can literally see it. They played like If it was a simple match.
that dance he does at the end is perfect this is a beautiful win for Morrocco
A proud Moroccan here! Keep your eyes on that cup and go straight to the goal.🎉❤
UnFbelievable.
Why no show Morocco's penalty kicks? 🤦🏽
Go Morocco go!!!
Well-done Morocco  You could have won the game in the extra time
For the love of God, ditch the garbage drill/trap music on the teams line up roster.
Wow congrats Morocco 🇲🇦. You guys had the bar going crazy here in the states. 🎉
Congrats to Morocco 🎉🎉 they had a great defense 🎉🎉🎉🎉 well deserved
What’s the entrance song ?
Everybody soooooooooo surprise that Morocco won this game.  Morocco is Black horse it might have a chance to win this year of World Cup!!! You never know because the soccer is circle!!! 💪💪💪💪💪
gotta love it
what a shame Spain!
Chetera is the Moroccan lukaku 😂😂
Just waiting for morroco to play a real team. The we will see
Gave me chills when he said Morocco knocked out Spain. Spain had the higher odds on this
Fox, I'm a New Yorker. We Footy fans don't mess around when it comes to showing both team's starting X1 and formations. Speak to your video editor about this please. Thank you
The Moroccan team is in good condition 🎉  Ithink thy gon wine World Cup 2022 god bless them and thanks for regraggi  he’s the best one 🎉
#thecupismoroccan
Great job Morocco
Bono is HIM! What a performance from that Moroccan team. They are absolutely deserving of a spot in the next round!
i won a gatorade and a bag of chips for this match 😂😂 cheers morocco
Like the spanish coach said "we have done 1000s penalty kicks"  I guess they missed 3
Where are the Moroccan pens??
Que bonito ver el crecimiento futbolistico de paises como Marruecos, misvrespetos y admiracion !
Well done Morocco love from 🇺🇸
Kinda sad that Busquets’ last moment representing Spain is missing a penalty.
Well done Morocco 👏👏
Spain, no stickers and finishers. Let's see what Portugal does, my prediction is a shootout, playing the odds I will go with Morocco to win.
Tiki-taka is over.
I just don't understand why so many professional players walk from so far back when kicking a penalty their positioning is  just terrible too far back and to straight, don't they have a coach to correct them? We saw Japon lose yesterday because of the same reason.
Ma sha Allah
Proud 👏
That’s what happens when you don’t take care of business during regulation
I’m glad spain is out ! They play so boring lol
What’s that song dam
LES GO MOROCCO
Yea fk the colonizers
Gotta love the WORLDCUP man best sport ALIVE!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✔️🙏🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏✌️✌️
スペインあんまり強くなかったと言うよりも、モロッコが脅威的に強かった。ガタイが良いし、パスワーク、フェイントの切れ、身体能力がすごい。よくスペインがモロッコを０点に抑えられたよなあって感じ。モロッコがこの大会優勝しても不思議じゃあない。
Anyone know what the oh ohhh ohh ohhh song they put in the stadium at the beginning is called ??
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🎉🎉
In case you wanted to know what pride looks like.
Looks like the Spaniards brought two too many horses in this one
The Korean keeper was tryna to do Bono against Neymar but got it wrong. 💀
beautiful
Viven en un cantry
Good Job
Yes
Now this is an upset….  Great job Morocco   You guys earned that
I am so happy ….Morocco make’s history. 🇲🇦 gives a great lesson for other African team 😮 congratulations again from Ethiopia 🇪🇹
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW, AWSOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEE👍😎
Yes! Well planned out to set the stage fir Argentina to get to the final and Messi to lift his World Cup.
The penalty
Where is Italy? Aren’t they good at soccer? Can’t find them in tournament.
This has been one of the best days of football. Makes me feel great to be witnessing this greatness.
Good saves, but also shocking penalty kicks.
Japan- "we're gonna go out there and put on the worst penalties in the history of the world cup"  Spain- "And we took that personally "
Morocco doesn't look like Africans...they're more Arab.
Not Spain but Enrique deserves this, I really love this😂, well done Morocco
Why do they not show all the penalty kicks???
Hats off to Morocco! Luis Henrique is trash hahaha
For Africa
I would make my penalty
Congratulation to Morocco . From Iran
fifa sucks
Bro I have this big screen inside a cafeteria in school we watch the World Cup everyone was screaming my ears hurt I vote team marraco
I’m in Spain without the S
I love this narrators. Spanish broadcast is annoying
If someone told you that Morocco will win Belgium 2-0, then it will knock Spain out in Round 16, would you believe that? Probably not. So, what do we learn from this? NEVER prejudice anyone or anything, and many seemingly impossible things are really possible! Congrats! Morocco ❤❤❤
Wow....
Hooray for Morocco!!!!!!
great goalie, happy nation
Omg bro Spain was devastated 😂
Is it that Spain don’t practice penalties no single power in any of their shots
España jajaja Quiere taco bell!! Sigue haciendo estremer  Luis Enrique jajaja
why don't they show all the penalty kicks? It would add like 30 seconds to the highlights.
Exactly why we call it the beautiful game!
Why can’t they show the entire shootout. I can’t find it
Spain passing games can be very inefficient and sooooo boring to even watch. what's the reason for keeping the ball when you don't even attemp to shoot???
why not show the entire shootout?
Congrats Morocco....
Now I  hope Morocco wins against Portugal
Let's talk about the goalie?
Congratulations to our brothers and sisters in Morocco ❤️ ألف مبروك للمغرب ❤️
This is probably the first time in World Cup history that a team did not score in regulation, extra and penalty kick periods. That's pathetic.
So boring. The stupidest overtime in all sports.
And to think Spain threw the last group match to avoid Brazil/Argentina. Poetic Justice.
Congrats Morrocco! Looks like the Moors conquered Spain again XD XD XD  G-UNIT!!!!!!
What a goal keeper and what a team!!!
This Spanish team is comprised of senior citizens and teenagers.
Best of luck Morocco 🇲🇦 well deserved!!greetings 🇲🇽
can someone explain how morocco won? its 0-0???
Someone teach the Spaniards how to take penalties, please. What a joke...can they hit them any softer?  Buona Fortuna,  Morocco.
Come back to this comment after the World Cup. The final will be between Portugal and Argentina because it’s rigged that way. Imagine all the views and money it will generate.
Crazy
This is why it is important to keep the winning momentum. The way Spain played against Japan it looked as though they were over confident. Anyways Morocco we’re always the more deserving of the two in this World Cup.
That’s what is happens when you don’t choose experience players because of your ego  congratulations marocco you deserve it
Definitely Morocco's day. If Spain puts one or two in those shots that they should have scored, game over. Congrats.
No freaking way 😳🤯🤯🤯🤯
Congrats Morocco, great victory!
Even in the last world cup, they deserved to be in the top 8 at least! Well-done and hope you win it all!
We are so proud of our players and our wonderful coach Waleed. We love you Guys! Thank you for making us happy in this world Cup!  🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤ 🇲🇦❤
The last Morocco penalty was a  Panenka move. Morocco 🇲🇦 🔥
Great win 🇲🇦 !!!!  And.. Is Fox sports prohibited from making a highlight longer than 5 minutes? You didnt even show the starting lineup for Spain.. and why not show the players on bench?  Smh
Rip Spain 🇪🇸 💀bed time🛌
Terrible WC for Spain shouldn't have even been in the round of 16
I'm so tired of these highlights. for one they're short. And two, who uploads 720p videos anymore!?! i hope ESPN gets world cup next year. This was ridiculous
Bono definitely needs to leave Sevilla, he’s too good
OMEGALUL
Spain sorry 🤣🤣💨
The colonized conquers the colonizer! Let's go!
I'm shocked!!!!
Embarrassing for Spain to not score a single penalty shot
WHAAAAAAT GOTTA LOVE THE MOROCCANS WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT LOVE YOUUUUU HAHAHAHAHA
Club doesn’t win the World Cup
Congrats 👏 Morocco kudos to the goalkeeper world class saves. Best luck against Portugal next 🤞🙏👊💯⚽🥅
Racist fox channel did not showed the  moroccan penalties whta a shame on you Cos spain is western country couldnot accept humility
Morocco did great job, well done lions
Since winning the World Cup, Spain have failed at the group stage (2014), and fizzled out in the round of 16 to a far inferior opponent (2018, 2022).
Was up with Spain players doing this slow lazy walk,?? Like if they were told to miss on purpose
Spain got fvked
It was sad seeing spain loose. This was a really good match and spain gets another try... at 2026.. yea 4 years-
Unbelievable how bad pros are at penalties, they over think it just drill it in a top corner it’s a goal each time 💀
Unbelievable how bad pros are at penalties, they over think it just drill it in a top corner it’s a goal each time 💀
Mesmerizing
It seems like Spain was playing scared, the defeat of Belgium by Morocco woke everyone up, it also spooked the so called top teams.   The Moroccans have definitely served notice.
These highlights are awful. How is it possible to summarize 120 minutes into 5 minutes? Didn’t even show Morocco’s penalties.
Congratulations
4:34 🐧🔥
CALL NEYMAR TO TAKE THE PENALTIES. HE'S THE MASTER.
moroco won fairly doesnt matter goalie did his thing stayed behind the line and just knew
Would be nice if you could post the complete shoutout.
Congratulations from Bangladesh!😊
Glad!
Morroco deserve this in proud of morroco
Former world powers in the comments section whining like sore leg babies that an African team won 😂😂😂
Great game
Proud to be Moroccan.  To the final, let's go 🇲🇦 , and why not the world cup itself.
Those are some of the worst PKs I  have ever seen. I thought Japan’s PKs were bad. SMH
This is why I watch the game.
Busquets , one my enemies for the last 15 years, didnt deserve to go put like that .
Would have been nice to continue the video showing their well-deserved win... @foxsoccer.
From Nigeria with love...we love you MOROCCO. Viva AFRICA...you sent BELGIUM and SPAIN home. We are ALL MOROCCANS
Wow congrats Morocco well done.
Love Portugal
Top 5 game of the world cup
2 AMAZING SAVES!! but why are the commentators and news outlets saying 3?
I'm so glad Ian Darke is commentating the world cup again. his calls are absolutely perfect for games like this
They threw Spain off by making them wear those baby blue jerseys! Look it up there's a social psychology experiment about an American Football team painting its visiting locker room pink
GTFOH!!! That was just amazing! Let's go Morocco!
I feel so proud of my brothers… go Morocco!!!!
I still can’t believe it, spectacular Morocco. Keeping up Africa pride. Good luck on to the end of this World Cup 👏🏾. Well deserved
That's what you get for dropping De Gea from the squad. Congrats to Morocco!!!
Penalty shootouts are the worst thing in sports. Completely unrelated to the game and complete chance
BIG win for morocco  BIG FAILURE for spain
These 5 minute highlight reels do not do these knockout stage matches justice... TSN Canada highlight videos are closer to 15 min. Fox Sports should not be covering World Cup.
Que bueno!
I swear, it seems like Spain has a different Kit every time I see them play,.
Congrats to Moroccans ❤ 🇲🇦🇵🇰
Morocow 💪💪💪💪
This may well be the best ever performance of a goalkeeper taking penalties in a world cup. His body wavering unitl the last nano second is original and may become a trend setting style in the future.
Congrats Morocco!
This goalkeeper is outstanding man
Mabroke
Spain is terrible in PK!!! HAHA 2002 and 20 years later in 2022 😂🤣
Rip 🪦 Enrique Astro boy /Andy toy story dad
Last minute 🎉
Rip 🪦 Enrique Astro boy /Andy toy story dad
that goalkeeper tho!!!
Congrats from Poland
Amazing Morocco 🇲🇦!!! Incredible game !!! Amazing win !!! Congratulations!!!!
Those slow run-up pens are not working 😂
This gives chills
What a shame from Spain they can't even aim
I had the goosebumps and I could feel there excitement. Great job 🇲🇦❤️💪
Spain clearly sold this match.
Fox sports highlights are made by someone who never watched or love soccer!!! Not just this one, but every game!
1.4 billion people waiting on you Morocco 🇲🇦 make African proud
I see a pretty obvious option how to beat Spain is to play 4-3-3 against them and keep all front 3 right in front of  Spain back 3, regardless of what is going on on the field. Spanish team wouldn't have an idea what to do, because they not used to. They used to have the back line as safe heaven. If leave them without option of a back pass when can't move forward they will be completely lost.
Spain needs to take that tiki taka blueprint and burn it! Last decade tactics don't work in today's games
Fantastique!  Merci. Chokran
Luis Enrique eligió a los mejor peores pareadores del mundo lol😅
Hakimi's panenka was the cherry on top.  Great skill and nerves of steel.  Well deserved good luck in the quarter finals!
Great tactical 🎯 game
Morocco has more spirit than talent. They are playing their max and you can tell. Unfortunately its not enough. Portugal will most likely squash them like they did with the Swiss.
Morocco √ final
Anything is possible if you work hard and persevere! Congrats Morocco!!
Spain with the S in those penalty’s
Morocco deserve the world cup
We have a BONOfied star for Morocco!!!!!
We are proud of u morocco  yes , from Indonesia absolutely support u until the final   Let's the rock
morocco played so well! happy for you guys ❤️🙏🏼
And again FOX embaresses itself by not caring to show two of Marocco's goals scored from penalies. Get with it FOX
Now, that’s a World Cup ! What a phenomenal goalkeeping performance ! 🎉Well done Morocco! With too many opportunities missed by the Spaniards, the Moroccans deserved to win triumphantly!
no mamen los jugadores de España como les valiera madres su ganaban o perdieran
That's what happens when you try to get a easy opponent 🇪🇸
Congrats to Morocco from Guinea!
The Moors will complete the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in the quarter finals!!! ✊🏾
Love seeing the underdog come out on top
Man that goalie is something else
The USA has ten times as many people and cannot put together a decent team and yet their fan boys scream as if they are the next coming of the savior. This is what world class competition is about! That group that can pull together and make people realize “it’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it the size of the fight in the dog.” First it was a shocker for Belgium. Now Spain? Oh my, Portugal had better take notice. This could weaken them after 90-120 minutes at this level. Cheers to all fans.
My ribs hurt from laughing.
Couldn’t have shown all the penalties?
Those were really Luis’s best penalty takers lmao??
What a pleasing sight to see two disgusts, germany and spain, kicked out of the WC!
Spain wear red t-shirt 😅 .that blue shirt make lose game 😢🤔.
Joder Tío!!! Que papá España 🇪🇸 le an echao del mundial . 😅
Spain keeping passing and passing till they don’t make it to the next round 😂
Parece un partido arreglado 😮
ITS THE WORLD CUP CAN WE GET BETTER HIGHLIGHTS??? GAME WENT TO EXTRA TIME AND PENALTIES AND WE CANT EVEN GET 5 MINUTES!! AND THEN ITS ONLY IN 720P CMON FOX SOCCER DO BETTER PLEASE
Congrats Morocco make all the other believe 🙏🏽
Espero Morocco ganenla copa
what an incredible goalie on Moroccos side!!
horrible penalties from spain lol
Spain's pks were the most timid and weak kicks I've ever seen. Absolutely pathetic.
I feel like Yassine Bounou being a keeper in La Liga definitely helped him against Spain. He plays against a lot of these players regularly
imagine a game going to a shootout in the knockout stage of the world cup...being a company that produces highlights...and only showing 4 of the 7 shots that are taken, and only 1 of the shots taken by the winning team.  Seems like totally unnecessary Eurocentric trash editing.
That’s it Spain is out. I knew Morocco was going to win it
I’m happy for Morocco. They deserve a big respect 🫡
I'm team Morocco from here on out.
Ziyech, Hakimi, Amrabat , Bono, Mazraoui, Saiis are sensational players ....
thats amazing I could not imagine this happening. Then the world cup came to my life again!
This morning I was like EH Spain has got this. I stand corrected and underestimated Morocco. Good for Morocco! Keep proving people wrong!
3-0: new world record, the lowest penalty shootout score ever.
Good job Morocco for advancing to the quarterfinals. They beat Spain.
What a surprise MOROCCO CONGRATS 💪👊🏻🤛🏻🤝👍🏼🤜🏻
Morocco 🇲🇦
Amrabat was absolutely insane in this match. He looked like a god among men.
I'm so proud of Morocco
MOROCCO GK DID VERY GOOD LETS GOOOOO
Ok so they didnt even show one morocco pk?!
For the championship Morocco!! Let's go!!
One of the best games yet
Nice! Go morocco!!
Go home colonizers!
go go africa
Viva maroccooooo
Good thing Spain got eliminated, their style of football is unbearable to watch. 70-85% possession just to do absolutely nothing with the ball until it's too late. They are their own worst enemy. What is the point of having the ball the whole game if you do nothing with it?
SHOW EVERY PENALTY KICK!
Ya ni los resumenes estan buenos como antes.ni modo no jalo esto.
Spain 🇪🇸 Realy Brought Barca To World Cup thinking this is 2010😼
The Hamiki dance....cute
japan and spain can't shoot penalty kicks. they must be drinking from the same coolaid
Im jusg saying that if you have morata in your team u deserve to fail badly
anyone know the opening song we hear when they walk on the pitch?
Best wold cup in a while
This is actually the most wild world cup ive ever seen
Congratulations to Morocco🇨🇲🇲🇦
I´m Hispanic and am sad to see losing my beloved España, but on the other hand, I feel happy for Morocco; I am so glad that an underdog is making history. I wish they win the world cup. That will be a huge impulse to North African soccer.
You can do it,just believe in your hidden power👍👍💪💪
Yassine Bounou should definitely be up for the Golden Glove
This is what happened to you when you left out your best captain Sergio Ramos 🐐 🐐
Utter failure for Spain🤨
Horrible editing on the video!!
Congratulations to Morocco 🇲🇦
As an American, you have my support Morocco! Beat Portugal!!!!
What a game big credit to the goalkeeper Bonou. They all deserve it
MashaAllah MashaAllah MashaAllah ❤️ from 🇺🇸
I missed two goals for Morocco, why?
720p only? You wouldn't do that with football!
I’m a Mexican 🇲🇽 supporting Morocco 🇲🇦.  We’ll done and I wish you guys the best of luck.  Mexico 🇲🇽 is with you.
we are Africa we are Morocco!
THAT WAS AMAZING.  GOOD LUCK MOROCCO.
What an upset...sheesh!
Fox, you know you guys can make these videos longer than 5 minutes right? It's ridiculous to not show all of the shots during the penalty shootout.
Loving the upsets this world cup
"I know where you're going. I speak Spanish!"
So happy Morocco won! I get bored watching Spain. Morocco play electrical!
Boufal is a beast
Congratulations Morooco
Spain 120 mins + penalty shot =    0+0=0
Spain tried to play the smart a**, but they got kicked in the a**.
Congratulations to Morocco from the USA! Wonderful performance!
The world is changing! Morocco on the rise, Spain is out of the round of 16 after Germany was out from Group! Unbelievable
Lesson learned. Spain needed RAMOS
listen to the stadium, wish more african teams made it this far
Y’all suck at highlight videos. Why does the prem get extended highlights but not the WORLDCUP? make it make sense
Im a Moroccan fan(I'm not arab or amazigh) but i made dua in the middle of the game and Alhamdulliah they won🥹
Bounou just became a national hero. Amazing performance. What a fun match.
Hakimi eliminating his origin country with no fear and regret 😨 monster
This is not that surprising Spain has been overrated for years now
SO EXCITED FOR MOROCCO!
This is the World Cup Cinderella story!
2:33 should of been a penalty smh
Hakimi got biggggggggg bigggggggg bolaaaas
Shame for Spain, they lose the game in group stage to play with Morocco, THIS IS what they got!
Morocco 🇲🇦 We will beat all those white peaches European people , Africa 4Life
Looking forward to Morocco's dismantling by Portugal. Thanks for "beating" Spain
well deserved victory, they came out unafraid and shocked an overconfident Spain. amazing!
For the love of God fox, please have Ian darke call the final game, these other announcers are so bad, Ian darke has such an epic voice
There's No Way Out for La Roja after Spain's loss to Morocco on the OT (overtime) penalty kicks in Round of 16
Spain should really have practiced their penalties! How embarrassing 😅
I knew Morocco had the penalty shootout in the bag. Every Spain player had a look of dread when they took their shot. No confidence.
is there a reason the other moroccan penalties are not shown?
What a boring game ever in round of 16. Anyway, good to see Morocco get in next round.👏👏 you guys deserve it.
I hope the team get demolished by france ngl
Fantastic
Enrique should’ve known it was a bad idea to bring so many bottlers ala Barcelona players 😂.
OUTSTANDING KEEPER and team defense. Asta la vista Espana.
Gotta love Ian Darke in commentary
Congratulations Morocco 🔥👐🫶
I wish they showed more of Morocco’s goals 🤷🏾‍♂️
I watched this when I was in my school, and everyone cheered when Bounou had three saves, Spanish teacher felt to distraught but all the students went for the underdog lol
Spain’s Pens were god awful, honestly
Spain : We lost our last game  thinking facing morocco would be easy....Morocco: We didn't top our group by luck. Spain : We should won our last game... Morocco is too late.
Congratulations Morocco! 🇲🇦 Hakimi the right man to finish that penalty
Wow Morocco! You in the prayers of a whole continent!
Smoking that spain pack today
The only Hope of Africa 🌍. Thank You Morocco 🇲🇦 https://youtu.be/QwY0TUMIp04  Unbelievable Lesson to Those Who Know The Truth and Refuse To Share from CHRIST
Fkin Hakimi with the Fkin waddle. Insane
please upload these in something better than 720p lol
Disrespectful for Hakimi to celebrate like that. Born and raised in Spain— I’m sure his family got benefits from the government hence why they moved there from his poverty country. Also educated in schools and football academies where they invested time and money in his development. Ungrateful. Just like most immigrants in European countries. Hakimi would be selling oranges in the streets of Casablanca if it weren’t for Spain giving him everything.
pov: u miss all 3 out of 3 penalties 😂
Spain is embarrassing, what a horrible team.
Would've never expected Spain to go out the way they did. But props to Morocco, especially that goal keeper.
Great win against a vaunted powerhouse like Spain. Maybe it's the will of Allah that they take this cup home.
Morocco 😁🙂 I am happy for you
Show the entire penalty shootout
Congrats to Morocco! I am so proud of the so called underdogs this world cup you guys are the champions! Cheers from Brazil 🇧🇷
good to see a colonizer get owned by a colony. beautiful from morocco.
2022 Morocco = 2014 Costa Rica
Whose stupid idea is it to cut off half the penalty shootout when most people want to see that specifically?? What kind of highlights remove the main part of the game. Smh
This is for the colonizer!
who is the goalie of Morocco ?... that guy is incredible !!!!
As a fan of the German national team, this has brought a smile to my face. Spain thought they would have an easier time with Morocco than they would with Croatia.
Excelente Marruecos!!!!!!! Solo los grandes quedan!!!!,,, Bueno también argentina.
Estoy que no me la creo! Estoy en shock! Qtar a dado enormes sorpresas! Los favoritos eliminados!
Oh man, this was definitely the most engaging game in the whole cup. So many chances and in the end the penalty kicks are what decided the game. Good job to Morocco
Now they know what japan felt like, when they couldn't buy a penalty goal
What a BRUTAL SHAME SPAIN CRY CRY CRY MY BABY
............. WOW.
❤❤❤ yes Morocco Algerian people will be so proud
I hope Morocco beats Penaldo!
Go Morocco🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Alexa, play Morocco by Moon Taxi
Bro no way
Looks like most of the people in the world just become Morocco fans, great job
Lets go Portugal lets trash morroco
Nmms wey
Great job Morocco. Great game .
People would lose their minds if someone eliminates Brazil on bus park master class. In fact, Cameroon beat Brazil just like this in the group stage.
HA HA HA! Spain deserves to lose! GO HOME SPAIN! Great job Morocco! I will continue to root for you.
Are the Moroccans mostly French nationals?
morocco has one of the best goalkeeper damm
Como en la epoca medieval : Marruecos dominando a España Enhorabuena Morros
Fifa finally learned a lesson
That Sergio Ramos celebration from Hakimi doe now that’s a real teammate ❤️
Waooo ESO SI no me lo esperava rompio quinielas y apuestas pero Bien marruecos
Bono vs Spain what a saves
Morocco all the way let’s goooo
Morocco with a great anti-football bus parking master class. Defending with 11 in the box throughout most of the match. Boring. I know people don’t want to admit it because they love upsets, but it’s true. That was tough to watch because one team didn’t want to play and wanted to wait it out on penalties. You will see more of this in four years when more anti football teams join the WC expansion party.
What kind of highlight reel skips most of the shootout goals?
4:37 did he just do waddle 😂😂 that’s cold
Morocco applied Ali's "rope-a-dope" successfully!
😂😂😂
What a game  The best so far I believe  Morocco yes you can bring the World Cup in Africa the whole continent is behind the team  Hold your ground don’t fear any team because the team has quality to become a champion  Love from a Senegalese
The FAlL of Spainnnnn
Why not showing Marrocos penalty quicks?? Racism here now or what?
Impressive how no ball enter the Morocco's goal zone even on Penalty time. Just amazing. Congratulations to Morocco.
Not showing all the Penalty Shots is just silly
This is what happens when you pass the ball back and forth for eternity……
Time to Africa 🌍
This commentators are boring 😴  where's the excitement
#1 Yassine Bounou, absolutely Bono!
STUNNER, ABSOLUTE STUNNER!!!
Worst talented Spain side.
These WC highlights have been truly godawful- y'all couldn't even show all the penalties?
You might want to include the whole shootout the next time.
WOW!
Even my son 16 year old could shoot better than those Spanish players
BEST WORLD CUP EVER!
Spain penalty kicks are just awful as Japan!
Why are you not showing Morocco penalties?
Morocco is the underdog for the underdogs this tournament. I’d love to see them go far!
*What a goalkeeper 🇲🇦 👏 🙌  respect from Somalia* 🇸🇴
do not skip pens guys
We need  extended highlights
Thanks VAHID HALILHODZIC
W GOALKEEPER FOR MOROCCO
Congratulations to Maroocoan team and especially to VAHID HALILHODZIC.This person created Morocco teaqm.Thanks VAHID
Another WC highlight reel that cut out the first penalty kick. What's the deal?
I’ll tell you what’s wrong with Spain. There’s too many foreigner players in that league and aren’t developing elite Spanish players.
Sorry to say this but without the fans and morocco being a muslim country, i dont think they would of won this one. Very good performance and they deserve to keep winning!!!
Wow!! History made! Spain shut out of the Semifinals!! Amazing!!
Show every pk next time please
Did Spain take a page out of Japan's book of penalty shooting?!  Unbelievable.
UNDEFEATED lets goooo great game Morocco, take it all the way
lol Spain
Where's the third Morocco's penalty???? suck again lol
That’s what Spain gets for loosing to Japan n get that 2nd spot in thier group if they wud have won Germany wud have got in n played morrocoo hahaha yeee Go Morocco;)
México 🇲🇽 apoyando a Marruecos 🇲🇦. Felicidades se lo merecían. Vamos por Portugal 🇵🇹.
Where's the second Morocco's penalty???? you guys suck at highlights
Why didnt yall show morroco pks
Where's the first Penalty of Morocco???? you guys have the worst Highlights ever
مبروك لمنتخبنا الثاني !!!!  🇲🇦🤝 🇩🇿
Give that goalkeeper a cookie and some money 💴
Should of called up Ramos instead just a bunch of washed up over rated barca players
Hakimi is glad he doesn't play in Spain anymore! He would be fired for eliminating them in the world cup! Lol
WHy didnt it show morocco pen goals???
Always at least one upset in the 16 thought it was gonna be Japan but glad Morocco came through for the under appreciated confederations
How dad has the penalty kicking been this world cup?  I don't think I've seen anything like it.
Spain really needed a player like Ramos with experience and his presence on the field when they need a leader… Spain blew it by having to many young players on the roster
Morocco 🇲🇦 Beat everyBody Up !! Congratulations you made AFRICA Proud.
Congrats Morocco 🇲🇦 playing good asl 😮
What do you expect when you don’t bring Thiago and De Gea along? No sympathy for Spain
Germany team be like yessssss!
Bravo Morocco!
Omg 😱
After my Japan has fallen in penalties, I am so happy for Morocco to have dominated there. What a clutch keeper!
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦LETS GO MOROCCO 🇲🇦 🇲🇦🇲🇦 LOVE FROM MEXICO!!!🇲🇽
So your not going to show Hakims penenka ✍🏾
Incredible, what an accomplishment by Morocco!! What a Goalkeeper ! Applause Morocco from Eritrea !
Terrible penalties oh my goodness
unbelievable…now please beat Portugal
how did Spain turn into a garbage team. They were a dynasty
Wow they did something so special 👏👏
What an upset! Shame they didn’t put Morocco’s pens in!
CEUTA IS NOW MORROCCAN
Respect to the Moroccan team.
This game have to be once of the biggest upset in the history of the world 🌎 cup.
Great kingdom of morocco
Show all penalties next time
🎉🎉CONGRATU EFFING LATIONS MORROCO!!!!🎉🎉🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 rooting for you from Mexico!!! GO AFRICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
🇪🇸 can’t score😂😂😂😂
Sergio Ramos would’ve scored haha
AL ANDALUS!!
Cograts to the underdogs
Congratilations to Morocco.from turkiye.
Spain starters are cowards, why is busquets not stepping up before the substitutes to take the penalty? Where is asensio and morata to step up for the team and take their penalties?
Morocco🇲🇦love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Just like what happed to JP
I love it. Go morroco  💪
Wow Morocco!!! What a performance!!!! Well deserved win!!!! ❤
Spain played terribly.  Luis Enrique paid for it by calling  up such a young team without much veteran leadership.  Those PK shots were shameful
God Bless you! Jesus is King and Loves You! Repent and Turn Your Life towards him!  Make Jesus Christ as Your Lord and Savior! You will Never, Ever Regret It!! God Bless You, He is Beside You!!! God Bless The Countries and People playing and All Over The World!!
España tiene que practicar más el cobro de penales, dieron lástima!!!
With that horrid jersey they deserved to lose
Congrats Morocco!
The Atlas Lions have certainly amazed the entire world.
Why would Spain shoot slow in penalties?
we watched this game in my arabic class because my teacher is from morocco. very fun few hours 🎉
Morocco has to face the same two teams that they faced in the Group Stage of the last World Cup, they beat Spain now can beat Portugal and make history by becoming the first team from Africa to reach the World Cup Semifinals, that would be AWESOME!!
Embarrassing for Spain
I laughed at those comments who thought Spain got an easy match by losing to Japan on purpose (which they weren't they got beat) to face Morocco. If only Morocco attacks were as good as their defending there won't be an extra time. Morocco remains the only team that hasn't conceded a goal by their opponent yet. They only have one own goal.
Super huge congrats to Morocco!!
Gavi overrated trash that only knows how to eat the turf.
Rip Overrated Spain! Weak team… couldn’t even make one Goal 🤣
🇸🇳🇲🇦🤍
Wow Morocco 🇲🇦 sure is playing well, and for Spain 🇪🇸 what a disappointment. Let's see how far Morocco can go.
how are you not going to show the 2 other made free kicks in a highlight real?? lol
Even India can beat any nation in penalty   lol 😆
Ronaldo and Messi is going to World Cup finals
Congratulations Portugal! 🎉
Congrats Morocco!!
Why in the world Fox edit out the scored penalties? (and the Moroccan missed) how much time they will save? c'mon man!!!
What's the name of the song when they're walking into the field
Congrats Morocco, well done! Africa is behind you, bring it home!
Shouts out to Morocco 🇲🇦. Africa is proud
No team will get very far with sergio busques as a #5 .  The guy at this point is good maybe for the MLS  .  Horrible coaching.   Also Morocco 🇲🇦  is too 😴  boring.  Obviously was looking for penalties from minute 1
How tf
Morocco learned well from Russia in 2018 against Spain
WoW! Morocco 🇲🇦 Great Upset!
Bro really said 🐧
This cup is so shocking. Did not expect that
We did it! Way to go Morocco! I am so proud of this team!
Not 1 spaniard in this comment section lol
show spain line up bots
Congratulation Maria, good team, morocco morocco
Since the beginning of the tournament Spain looked drained.  Congrats to Morocco for their victory!!! I still got Portugal 🇵🇹 beating them 2-0
Morocco ❤️👌🚀
I swear to God Spain got the dumbest goalie ever seeing this live killed me 😭
Not really surprised tbh. Spain has not been playing good enough to be convincing. Congrats to Morocco! Let the journey continue 🤙🏾
👍
OH MY GOODNESS. I’ve been waiting for this moment since I was 6 years old. We’ll deserved go MORROCO🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Been a fan of Morocco since the 90 arab team In the world go win one for us
Was Spain even trying in those penalties? Breh.
Morocco 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Highlight was trash didn’t even show Morocco penalties
this game puts you to sleep. portugal will send morocco home.
Good for them but that’s about it
Morocco got lucky. Players not has high calibre as Spain or other big teams.
How on earth are they leaving out the moroccan penalties???
Someone needs to tell Spain passing doesn’t equate to goals lol.
Wow. Spain was one of the team I expected to make top 4 and groups was so promising. Congratulations Morocco
Busquets has scored two goals in his entire career.
Spain is the reason people hate watching soccer. That was more boring than soccer.
ان شاء الله المغرب يفوز علي البرتغال ويروحوا البرتغاليين علي يد اسود الاطلس
Weak free kicker by spaniards team 😅😅😅😅
Ahora si moros contra cristianos!
مع اي نادي يلعب حارس مرمي المغرب وجاءا في حد يعرف . هل انه يلعب مع فريق اوروبي او محلي مغربي
Soooo happy for Morocco!! Congratulations!! Greetings from a Peruvian in Florida 💚
denazification of world cup continues. five down, four more to go.
الف مبرووووووووووووووووك لمنتخب المغرب ومنتخب العرب ومنتخب المسلمين. والله فرحنالكم كأنوا منتخبنا الوطني فاز. اليوم فرحتنا غير عن باقي الافراح. مشجع من العراق 🇮🇶🇮🇶 🇲🇦🇲🇦 من بداية الموندايل والمغرب فريقي المفضل ❤️
Come on Fox, is it too much to ask to watch every pk. I watched the highlights to see the highlights, not miss 3 of the pks because I guess they weren’t important or something. Disappointing.
I see Spain used japan’s penalty kick strategy
هل المغرب رح تلعب مع البرتغال بعد هذا النصر العظيم . والله شيء فظيع ورايءع ويرفع الراس وكل شيء . ايش الحول الشخص بعد . مين يعرف حارس المغرب يلعب لاي نادي
Morocco fought hard and won. Well deserved win. 👏
😂😂😂😂
🤣 interesting game. way to go
Why not show the complete penalty shoot-out !!! They skipped the Morrocan kicks idiots ...
Hakamis victory dance was amazing 😂😂 4:36
Spain fail again.
I never really liked penalty kicks as the tie breaker. Might as well have the captains guess what number the ref is thinking. It has the same amount to do with the actual game of soccer.
Can't show all the penalties? What a joke.
The Coach chose only BARCA players 😕😕😕
BONO KING
❤❤❤ 🇵🇸🇲🇦
Messi vs Ronaldo in the final would be an awesome
Morocco coach is the man of the match
that's what the spaniards get for wearing those goofy coloured jerseys 🤣
Oh my god ❤
Love to my Moroccan brothers🇲🇦🇲🇦😍😍😍 it’s a North African win 🇺🇸 you honored us your brother from Algeria🇩🇿
Why not show the whole goals of morocco?
did the better team win?  maybe there should be some innovation around the game of soccer concerning the penalty shootout.   it may as well be "12 paces at dawn with pistols".   It doesnt relate at all to the previous 120 minutes of play.    If they could somehow use the metrics of KEY PASS / BIG CHANCE to settle the game.
Spanish must clean well like Japanese? 🤣
Hakimi’s smile is priceless 🙌🏼
I swear I will never understand why players take 2-3 steps away from the ball on penalties. Like you’re never gonna get any power on the shot like that. Penalties are all about guessing the right spot for the keeper but you’re always gonna run the risk of the keeper guessing the right way but atleast if you have a good run up you’ll have a chance for it to go past them with some power. I’m not saying smash upper v every time but the way they Spain took those shots were horrible
Fantastic job! They took it to Spain and threatened on the attack and the goalkeeper was spot on during penalties. Felt bad for Luis Enrique, but that's typical for Spain to underachieve, with the exception of 2010.
Spain......hahaha
Congrats from South Africa!
Let's GOOOOOOOOO MOROCCO~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!
I called it
Spain - what a bunch of sissies ! Better team won. Congratulations to Morocco !
Why didn't you show M goals?!?! FU fox sports
It is time for the World Cup to go to Africa. Morocco played with the heart. Congratulations 🎉👏!
Morocco those pks were savage
Morocco is the only dark horse left in this tournament. I hope they make history, best wishes from USA.
Spain curse from them and England steal rock 🪨🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolute disgrace. No strength, no hight, no tricks in those penalties from Spain
Yea oh SI #Spain deserves to loose even though #English audio game doesnt have any emotion whatsoever unlike #español commentary does when3ver theres a GOAL!!!!!!!! ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE..WEAK.....🤭🤭🤭
Spain pay a big price when they let Japan won the group and Germany have to go home
Japanese aren’t the worst penalty kickers anymore.
He hit that penguin on them 🤣 🐧
Morocco's goalie shook the world with his game today. So Impressed, a prestigious club should sign him ASAP.
For the last time, SHOW ALL THE PENALTIES. We all know FOX is the worst network, you don't have to prove it with every video. Curses on whoever edits these. It's the World Cup, for gods sake.
Where is the morocco goals !!!  You guys are hater
I watcxhed much of it   on TV live live and I felt like Spain simply was too careful in the penalty area when it came to finishing. Too bad they lost. Morocco did defend well.
The waddle after the penalty 😂 Don't tell me American Football doesn't gave an effect
Those pk's were taken horrendously. Props to the keeper!
Thats why you need champions like alcantara or s.ramos. whenever the game is tough and you need leadership and personality on the penalties they would have stepped up. Well deserved morocco.
❤ Marocco
Congratulations Morocco!!! Happy to see an African country  advance further!! Love from USA and Mexico.
I leapt out of my seat after each save in the shootout. I’m so happy for Morocco. A tough match throughout. Spain’s failure of arrogance to not adjust the game plan for Morocco bit them. On to Portugal!
Why do they decide the outcome of an elimination game of a team sport with a one versus one competition?
Aint no way I just heard living rent free in Soler's head
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦  greating from Eritrea 🇪🇷
Spain deserved to lose. Maybe in the future they won't field anti competitive players that are way past their best form.
Spain is notorious for playing around in the back and getting scored on. Smh
Fox highlights suck so bad they can’t even show all the penalty kicks
We are so happy to our second team Morocco way to go Iraqi love Morocco
Spain,sucks we knew, luis enrique, bad coach, he only picked 2 from real madrid and other teams,,and the majority from barcelona fc,tiki taka, is over, you have ball possession. But not scoring, bad, for spain, congrats to morrocco
MashaAllah
Im rooting for them, I will love to see them in the final. They truly deserve it.
Spain is not strong team any more they lost against Japan and Morocco.
What a match, great job to the National Team of Morocco 🇲🇦 well deserved 🎉👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Wow! Nice...congrats, Morocco.
They didn’t get S.Ramos, DeGea, Nacho ! Deserved win for Morocco ! Go home Spain !
I agree with no politics at the World Cup but then they should be consistent. Morocco shouldn’t be allowed to celebrate with a palestine flag. Of course this Muslim country has a double standard on that political issue. They would be livid if someone brought an Israeli flag
*BONO*
Fcuk in Fox, can’t they show all the penalties! Poorest WC coverage ever I have seen.
Morocco just ROCKED Spain. They are henceforth known as The Roc. Their new motto should be Let's Roc. (I got pages of these, I can go on and on.)  Lo siento Espana. Congratulations et felicitations Morocco on your Best World Cup Ever. Good luck against the other Iberia team, gonna need it!
Morocco💪 all day everyday  يارب المنتخب المغربي يفوز بطوله العالم لكرة القدم  اخوكم من سوريه 🇲🇦 🇲🇦
So glad those Spanish  thugs lost.😂
I truly feel for the Spain players tho
Its 2022, why are these videos in 720p?
He did the waddle dance
Wow wow Congratulations Morocco!!
too bad japan didnt do this lol but happy for at least one upset
Kudos to Morocco! They believed in themselves!
boring! 0-0 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Glad overhyped Spain is eliminated! They had a scary 5 mins when Costa Rica led Germany almost getting eliminated in group stages. Now they can go play their hyped La Liga !
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦
Woo!!!
Wow
Told my friend it would be incredible to see Morocco go all the way. Glad to see they heard me and have taken the next step.
Wonderful
🇲🇦
🇲🇦is unsung, they were due ;-) Maghreb!!!!!
The three people who kick 🦵 the penalty Spain there no good for the penalty that’s why we lost 😞
@aligatie
I wish y'all showed ALL of the penalties taken. Also the highlights are far too short
I will be not surprised if Maroko win World Cup 👍
🇲🇦 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🎉🎉🎉
Weird japan Also lost the same way. A lot of miss penalties.
Love from Ethiopia!
Morocco congratulations, go make Africa proud and bring the World Cup to Africa. You did what Ghana 🇬🇭 Senegal 🇸🇳 and Tunisia 🇹🇳 couldn’t do! Cameroon 🇨🇲 made us proud as well by playing Brazil like a second division team. Kudos Morocco 🇲🇦
From PORTUGAL, Spain have a safe trip home god bless you!
ÉSO ESO ÉSO ESO ÉSO ESO ÉSO ESO ÉSO ESO ÉSO ESO ÉSO ESO ÉSO ESO ÉSO ESO ÉSO ESO GANÓ MARUECO ARRIBA LOS MARUECANOS...
Spain is crying now!! 😂😂😂😂😂
I hope Morocco makes it to Semi finals they have played with their hearts out
France vs Brazil or  France vs Portugal for finals.  As far as what I have seen. Morocco needs a stronger forward to win. Only thing lacking. Amazing defense. The passion and dedication they showed was amazing. Happy for Morocco.
Well Deserved win 🏆 from The African Team MOROCCO 🤴🏿🤞🏾✊🏾✌🏾👋🏾 Moroccans yesss
Congrats Morroco!! Spain yinz suck at PKs lol look like peewee players save your attempts
The energy Morocco fans brought to the stadium was on par with what Mexican and Brazilian fans have brought 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Credit to Morocco they’ve been playing out of their minds. But Spain just couldn’t get it done. This is football.
So happy for Morocco 🙏🏽🍾. Would really be amazing to see a final with an underdog team. Hopeful 🙏🏽
the power of ALLAH
Love it 😀
LOVE HOW YALL SHORT CHANGED THE FREAKING AUDIENCE BY NOT PLAYING THE MAKES BY MORROCO THO....NEXT TIME INCLUDE ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS IN PENALTY TOO... dont just show the BIG DOG failing...highlight the small guys EXCELLING... f***ing weirdos
Congratulations brothers Morocco people!! Happy for you!!!
🤯🤯🤯
@Fox Soccer, please make these highlights around 15 mins so that you can capture all the important moments of the game. You can get an idea from NBC news' EPL highlights. Thanks
segui en twitch Luis Enrique hahhahaha que ironico.......
دمت گرم
😂😂😂😂
who told the editor clips could only be 5 minutes?
The Moroccan team was great, and their defense impeccable. Congrats!👏🏾  On the other hand, their fans in the ground with whistling or whatever the noise they did whenever the opposition had the ball made it unbelievably harder for anyone neutral to enjoy the game and probably missed an opportunity to win the hearts of the world. Imagine how it was for Spain on top of the heartbreak. Geeze, I hope they aren't this insane in the next game.
How nice that they don’t show the other 3 Morocco penalties
as an algerian person, i support our moroccan brothers. as a north african, we are fighting for you 🇲🇦❤!!
Syrian from America ..💪🇲🇦🇲🇦Morocco
Spain🤝losing to underdogs
Spain really not showing effort in the shootout😂
So proud of the Moroccan team, they are showing 110%. I wish them luck in the quarter finals. 🇲🇦🇲🇦 Go Morocco!🇲🇦🇲🇦
Fox your highlights are terrible. You didn’t show any of the Morocco goals except the last one?
Hi.hello! I wish your family happy healthy always. Thank you very much. Have a good weekend. Happy holidays. I wish your sleeping and family happy healthy always. I wish your successful in your work with family happy healthy always. I wish your life in your smile with family happy healthy always.
21 is so bad n selfish
That wus awesome incredible
This channel has the worst highlights page I’ve ever seen. Just cus they’re trying to get their videos to be 5 minutes long
Spain is my team, but they didn’t deserve to be here.  Morocco showed they wanted it more.  Good for y’all.
Morocco 👏👍💪🇧🇦
Morroco's goalie says "Nothing can pass by me today". Congrats, Morroco. 👏
Spain just passed all games and didn't even try to shoot outside the 18 yard box. What a boring match. Morocco tactics are boring and they didn't even try to press forward.
So Glad about Morocco Win! I've been to their Country! Congratulations
Bono, from Who Knew.
Unbelievable
Why don't you show all of the penalty kicks?
You couldn’t bother posting the full shootout? Need ESPN to gain rights back
Y donde esta pique
For a while there I thought Manchester City was playing in Spain place in this world cup
The winner will be a European or south American  team not ISLAM
Spains LOUSY 'shootin'- MoroC deserves to Win!
spain lost to a team in penalty kicks again in the world cup. I'm trying to remember when the last time was! Oh it was 20 years ago against my home country.
Well it is great to see Morocco advance, but I have to be honest it was a lottery with the penalties. I think Spain vanished completely in the 2nd round, so I guess their coach will be become a gamer or streamer full time now.
Thank you, Morocco! -from all former Spanish colonies
Wow
So glad Spain lost! They put the world to sleep with their keep away, endless possession, and gutless attacks!
What is this editing. Why am I not seeing the Morocco penalties except the last one and only the Spain misses. Terrible editing
Congrats Morocco 💯
Best team ever in my eyes!! Good luck my boys!!!!!
Looks like Spain wasted all the gasoline with Costa Rica, Japan, Germany. The goal scoring dried up the well. I still don't understand why Spain went playing with Manchester City uniform in the 2nd round. The crying emoji water Spain uniform will be mocked by fans for sure.
Sergio Ramos, Thiago would've scored those penalties
fierce defense by the Moroccans
That happened when Spain try to let Germany team home so fk Spain
Bono the cat, wow, Moroccans made me so happy today!
What a panenka from Hakimi… and the waddle celebration was perfect 😂
Mabroooooooooook!!!!!!
Morocco will definitely beat Portugal. That is for sure.  The way they played against Spain was mesmerizing!
Making history Morocco congratulations 🎉
If david villa , torres , iniesta ,xavi , ramos , pique still play for spain  they win today
Congrats Morocco from USA!!!!!!!!!
Yooo what were those penalties by Spain 😂😂😂 loser mentality right there.
Go Morocco!
This is Wolrd Cup is full of surprises.  Nice to see new underdogs advancing.
Well done. Morocco. One love from Southern Africa.
I remember when I visited Morocco in 2018, and how excited everyone there was just to qualify for the 2018 WC.    They've certainly come a long way.     They are legit.
Amazing!
The repeat of 4 years ago...Good day Marocco
Why do you have to make short five mins highlights? Like you didn't even show all the PKs after extra time was over. SMH
Wow,Morocco deserves it though; I think they played better.
Slept off 😂 while watching this live thinking Spain 🇪🇸 will win wow am shocked 😳 the didn’t
Congrats to Morocco but Portugal will absolute demolish you lot
🇲🇦 ruled 🇪🇸 before anyway
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MOROCKIN ROLL!!!!!!!!!!!
everyone saying Spain conceding to Japan was a genius move didn't age very well😀😁
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦❤️from Somalia 🇸🇴🇸🇴👌🏿👌🏿
beautiful moment! Gives me goosebumps!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Morocco 🇲🇦   I'm so proud of you. 🇪🇹
Hakimi celebrated by doing the "Waddle". Love me some Jaylen Waddle! Love me some penalty kick drama! Congrats Morocco!
Ceuta & Melilla Give them back NOW!!
Congratulations to Morocco from Croatia
It's bad enough that Spain lost,  but on top of that seeing their three neighbors:  France, Morocco and Portugal make it through to the Final 8.
Omg now this one had me verbally talkin behind the screen, Morocco’s defense for the penalty kick was insane, great trickery against the attacking Spain shots, if I would say what game was my fav, it would be this one 💯
Congrats Morocco 🇲🇦
Marroco fans best thing Ive seen this cup 😳
Love it 🎉
لي جا بسم الله بديت نطمع و داير النية
Spanish players they are still young and they don't have that experience against Moroccan full of enthusiasm and freshness.
And the USA can't even go as far as Morocco did, LMMMMAAAAAAOOOOOOOO!!!
Even Japan did better at penalties 💀
So many new stars this world cup
Are penalties competitive?
Let's go Morocco from China!!!
who would have thought that an Irishman would save Morocco from Spain😀😁
Incredible chances for both teams, great game.
Oh that’s hilarious
شکر یاالله  مراکش پیروزشد
Why is the video cut short ?
https://youtube.com/shorts/MR1-F2Ub418?feature=share
Hakimi turned into a penguin with that celebration 😂😂😂😂
Morocco chased down every single ball. Top notch fitness along with true grit and determination. Well deserved Habibis
Good job, Morocco. I am pretty happy those cocky Spainish players went home after they conceded game against japan on purpose
Biscuit finished
Y querian comparar a España con Brazil 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...muertos!!
MOROCO  HAVE  ONE   MORE UPSET  IN THEM ,THEY WILL  BE  IN THE  SEMIFINALS, YOU SHOULD  HAVE  SEEN THE  LOOK ON THE  FACE  OF FIFA  PRESIDENT  after  Morocco  match
And he did the Waddle!!
They lost the last play-off stage game just to play with morocco and now they got kicked out. That's karma 😅
Congratulations brothers .’ Im Argentinian but definitely im happy you guys made it to quarter finals and proud for Africa 💜
100% skill and NO politics. You want to win? Call up the best, not the VETERANS.
never underestimate ANY team! This is so inspiring!
Morocco, the jewel of Africa... Get in boys.!!! Giant slayers!!!  Much love and respect from Mexico!!!!
A los españoles les ganaron los nervios en los penales.
Huge for Hakimi, as he the opportunity to represent Spain but chose Morroco
Good saves by the gk dammmm...but i'm really confused on Spain's choice of PK takers
The goalkeepers this tournament seem to by trying to one up each other... Bono was incredible!
It's truly insane to be able to save all the penalties in a shootout. Morocco's goalkeeper truly had his ultra instincts on. And has ice-cold nerves of steel!
Put Morocco 🇲🇦 In The finals they deserve it  Yayayayayayayayayaya Wooo!!! Rauuul!!!
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Well somebodies transfer fee just went up.
Morocco 🇲🇦 made history great jobs
Just wow. Amazing game
Let’s go Morocco, you have your Muslim brother support, no matter the out come we are proud of you.
wow Spain w some atrocious penalties
Alhamdulillah
Algerian Amazigh for Morocco👍 congratulations What Amazing victory
Morocco, Africa is behind you.
They had to cut the penalty shootout 👎👎👎👎
Reynoldo your reign is  over, time  for  new  blood Argentina  need to do the  same  bench Messi give  the  young guys  a run  if they  ever  want to win a world  cup
Full throttle now  🇲🇦 love from 🇧🇦
3:10 bruh, your telling a pro soccer player didn’t shoot it from there?? Is this scripted or something
Maaaalos los españoles fallando todos los tiros
I'm going in the opposite direction here. What's up with Spain's penalty kicking? 😐 Little steps and soft kicks.
Yoooo
Spain and Japan must have the same penalty kick coaches
I thought an upset would happen.
Why they dont show Morocco penalties thats stupid
Wow~! What a game. Congrats Morocco!
The beauty of football
Jaylen Waddle will be calling in regards to that Penguin celebration!! 🐬⬆️🐬⬆️
From Brazil 🇧🇷. Congratulation Marrocos 🇲🇦
why is it that the first two penalty shootout of morocco are not shown?????????
La verdad España es muy arrogante aunque pretendan no serlo, un ejemplo claro Luis Enrique cabreado por que habian perdido contra Japón (casi casi menospreciandola) y por otro lado el entrenador de Japon no hacia otra cosa que exaltar el nivel de España, ademas de que (ya es mi opinion) Japón expuso la deficiencias del tiki taka de Espana, cuando hay presion en el campo no existe el tiki taka y prevalece la torperza en las jugadas por eso hoy estan fuera, tomen nota de eso.
El stream de Luis Enrique los elimino!!
thanks for showing 1 of the 4 penalties taken by morocco, absolute joke of a set of highlights.
thats what u get by keeping ge gea ,ramos etc out !!!!
Way to go Morocco....
Spain was definitely a finalist contender, this is huge 🇲🇦🇲🇦💪
Africa is vastly improving
so not only Japan sucks at penalty kicks.
Idk y but i feel like spain sold themselves at the end
The Muslims are so happy!   Let's go Moroccoooo! 🇲🇦 🇲🇦
Can you talk about that HAKiM penalty? Lol 😂 that’s world classic penalty, Dude had confidence in it. Congratulations White/yellow Africans.
And this is why I lo e the sport!
No Ramos no cup😅😅
Awesome play and now you will face Portugal.
Happing seeing Spain 🇪🇸 out
They’ll just give anybody the number 10 these days.
Expect better quality highlights which are at least for 10 mins!
Morocco 🇲🇦!
Good job Morocco
W MORROCCO MY TURN NEXT!
That goalkeeper 👏
Woooooow 👏🏾👏🏾
Nice, We hope Morocco goes All the way, Please Pray for Iranian People to Destroy Evil Mullah's , God Bless and for Next World Cup Iran will be Free with NCRI and Presidency of Maryam Rajavi, Thanks and May God Bless us All
No hunger on those PKs from Spain.
Eso le paso a españa por miedosos pensaron que podrian ganar facil evitando a brasil
Aw, these Spain jerseys are horrendous. They should've went back to the classic jerseys like from the 2010 final
People tried talking about how Belgium lost , now they eliminated spain too 🔥🤣
What kick for spain.  Very  slow  kick ball.       Sim of. Japón. Kick ball slow.  For what what happen
Hakimi had to chip the keeper 😭😭😂
España once again let me down in penalties
Yes! The Jews are not winning
Proof Spain is nothing without Argentinians. Only reason their league is competitive.
So FOX couldn't show us the two penalty goals by Morocco? Like how many extra seconds you could've added... nothing more than 20 secs
This Wc is better than 2018,
These are horrible highlights! No reason not to show all of Morocco's penalty kick goals
Hahahahahahahahaha So nice to see Spain fail. Well done Morocco👍🏼
Congrats Morocco well deserving with all the excellent football you brought to this World Cup not surprised the entire World has caught up to the once DOMINANT Nations . Spain , Germany , just to name a few .❤ 🇲🇦.
Congrats from Palestine . Great game !
Congrtulations people and Kingdom of Morocco. I hope you would be the finalist. Better luck Morocco.
Why not show the Morocco penalty shots?
Bono made it look easy the Moroccan Wall
Congratulations to you guys. All African are supporting you. Never give up guys
The most intense match this world cup! I love it when the underdogs prevail. Morocco is on fire and it can go really far! Best defense.
Fox: pls increase the highlight count. It's missing so much. Thank you
Bruh
Slept all day... Didn't even wanna know the score... But wow the came through for Africa today.. thank yaw...
Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
politics and rigged
They said Japan had bad pens & didn’t praise Croatias goalie but Spain had horrific pens & praise their goalie ? Makes no sense
Weak pens from Spain disgrace
Glad Spain lost, the way they played today wasn't it.
Shame, shame, Spain. They played with no pride!!!
Well deserved win by Morocco, praying you would make it all the way .
Well deserved they are the underdogs 😁
Hakimi actually violated the entire country of Spain with this pen
Unbelievable ❤
That why you have to play every game like is the finals not saying the were lucky but luck is also a skill  congrats morocco
congratulations to Morocco. Our countries' flags look similar. From Vietnam
Those pens by Spain didn't look like a teak who practiced PKs at all 😂😂...I was just laughing when the commentator was yapping about Spain players taking 1000+ pens to practice 😂
Morocco’s keeper will be crowned king when he returns home after that performance!
Yo this world cup is legendary
Congratulations my brothers and all Africa are proud you.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Marruecos un hueso duro de roer
Tiki Taka is done. Spain needs to change their ways. They have done nothing since the Costa Rica game
Truth is Morroco had the better clear cut chances and deservedly are through to the Quarter Final. I laughed when the commentator was yapping about Spain practicing pens. What you need in a shootout is  a confident goalie because nerves will almost eliminate all of the practicing you've done prior.
Why did Spain make these randoms take the first two PKs?? Terrible decision 💀
Well done Morocco 🇲🇦 from Ethiopia🇪🇹
All of Africa is behind u MOROCCO!! Love from Somali 😭😭
Gavi overrated💀
Where are the faking morroco goals on this higlights???
Barc need to sign BONO!!!
Congratulations, Morocco 🎉 From the USA 🇺🇸
You didn’t show Morocco penalties that’s mean
What is wrong with this fox Chanel why didn’t show any goals given by Morocco.
o mie gawdd
Woohoo Congrats Morocco 🇲🇦
Yay for Morocco!
Bono is literally a wall, nothing gets past him 😤😤😤🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
The media really convinced y’all that Gavi and Pedri were good 😂
So beautiful seeing Morocco succeed!!!! ❤️
Morocco 🇲🇦 stands strong in the middle of all of these big teams. Congrats guys. Do me a favor, bring that world cup to Africa. Okay!
No real goal scores that Spain team got
Busquets in the thumbnail:  “record-scratch-freeze-frame-yep-thats-me, you’re probably wondering how I got here”
Jolines qué ha pasao !!!! ?
Let’s go Morocco✊🏿
Congrats Morocco on a well earned shocker! 🍾🎊🎉🎈
Hakimi… what a boss
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA BYE BYE SPAIN HAHAHAH!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No Spain lineup?
Morocco make it!!..Morocco makes history. I can’t stop watching this. A huge Congratulations🎉
The great Moroccan wall
Looks like the New World Order is around the corner. I'm completely surprised.  congratulation for your hard works. luck always favors the determined  hard workers and the Braves.
VIVA MARRUECOS...
That final celebration was soo adorable. What a game Morocco…keep the momentum
Bounou ☝🏻
Great Job to the Arab's.    We shall see what happens next. Ole Ole Ole.......
NEXT  OUT BRAZIL Y ARGENTINA...
All of Africa is behind Morocco,  All of the Arabic world is behind Morocco  All of Asia, North America and Australia is behind Morocco
Funny thing that hakimi panenka snd penguin dsnce he does with Ramos (Spain)
Why not put all the pk shots
What an upset😂🖐️😐
The biggest mistake is taking the game to penalties.
Morocco your goal keeper  Iron man like spider man real  super hero ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations from Korea!
Spain saw Japan’s abysmal penalty taking and said “I’ll do you one better”
MROCCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This could possibly be the biggest upset in World Cup history ? This amazing
If Morocco can hold onto possession better and execute on their breakaways I think they have a real shot to go far. Their defense and goalie are actually insane!
4:08 greatest line in the whole cup thus far
The underdog lives on!
The keeper was impressive 👏
Wow. Tremendous result. And the keeper? Amazing. Congrats, Morocco.
🇵🇹 !!!
I don’t see how people can hate soccer ! Especially the World Cup ! You get to see people from all around the world and be a part of something special that only happens every 4 years
Between Spain and South Korea, that was the worst kicks from the spot I've ever seen!
Morocco baby 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
I am very pleased to see the great game.  Morocco will be the champion in the Worldcup 2022
picking your opponent NEVER ends well for you
All the "super stars" teams are gone😊
Thisnis a perfect example why I now root against La Liga clubs now!!
Amazing performance by the underdog, continue making Africa proud Morocco!
The so called "underdog" teams in this cup are putting the world on notice. The days of only a handful of teams actually competing are over, the other countries talent is starting to rise up & I love it.
Moroccos goalkeeper was on fire. Best goalkeeping display in this worldcup so far.
My African brothers coming up!!
Man Spain 🇪🇸 trash 🤦🏽‍♂️
You knew going in that Morocco was super solid on defence, relying on the counter. Spain should have pushed the pace from the first whistle. Even if they gave up a goal on the counter, they'd have opened up the game. Instead, they played right into Morocco's hands.  Having gone out timidly on penalties in the last World Cup, you'd think they would have done ANYTHING to avoid a repeat. And it makes their 7-0 win in the first game seem even more ironic.  Morocco were impressive defensively and it's amazing that they've only conceded the own goal in four games!
Wow Morocco. What a win.
The football god doesn't like the arrogant.
Congratulations Morocco
Por jotos
Who decided not to include any of the Moroccan successful penalties in the highlight? I have never saw a highlights clip which prioritised goalkeeper saves over the actual goals. What a bunch of amateurs!!!!
just like in the past
That was a well deserved win congrats 👍🎉
Once again, imagine calling it highlights and not including the PK goals
Whatsup with these penalty shots from Japan and now Spain?!
Go ahead Morocco 🇲🇦
Penguin scored
Yesssss.....!!!
I think it's Brazil vs Morocco FINAL 🏆⚽
morocco did so good im so proud
That last PK was a slap in the face haha
What on earth is going on with penalties in this world cup theyre terrible, all on the ground ready to be saved and with no power behind the ball . Very disappointing from Spain but well done to morrocco making history for their country in the world cup
Congratulations to Morocco
African for Morocco TIA ( this is Africa 🌍 )
So happy to see luis enrique lose, he was the shittiest spain coach ever who sides with barkas player all the time.
Both Spain and Japan were garbage in penalties unfortunately…
So, in his spare time away from U2, Bono also plays goalkeeper for Morocco.  His singing is not half bad but his goalkeeping is out of this world.  Man of the match for 120 minutes and then a shot-killer during penalty kicks.  So well done!!  Que viva Morocco!!
Wow 👏🏽
Can we talk about how clean Hakimi's penalty was? He has the confidence to knock Spain out of the World Cup with a cheeky Panenka and just proves how valuable he is to Morocco. In my opinion, he is the best full back in the tournament and among the top in the world.
that's what we get for wearing sky blue.
Morocco - Africa is proud of you. The Arab world is proud of you. 57 Islamic countries are proud of you. The world is proud of you.
الحماس والجو في الملعب كان مبالغة. والله فرحان ليكم يا المغاربة و والله أحس كأن منتخب بلادي فاز في كأس العالم وألف مبروك لكم ولأفريقيا ولأمة المسلمين قاطبة ألف مبروك النصر 💯💯💯💯 أخوكم من السودان 🇸🇩
Good reason to devastate belgian and french cities by arabs.
Morocco my new favorite team praying they make it to the finals🙏
Credit goes to Morocco goalkeeper 👏
Absolutely incredible 👏
Cheers kings👑✨👑🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Se vendieron los españoles! Mi hijo de 12 años le pega más fuerte a la pelota en un tiro de penal!!🙄🙄🙄
let 2 psg players with very little playing time kick the first two penalties?
Wow! Japan couldn't score because the goalkeeper was too clever, but today Morocco's goalkeeper was too clever for Spain.....Way to go Morocco.....keep winning....good luck against France!!!
España le entraron temblores como las p….😂
wow so amazing!
To the history indeed! Morocco beating Spain! First world soccer team defeated by a third world soccer team!
L Spain 🇪🇸👎 you gotta do better as a giant. Congrats Morocco 🇲🇦🔥
Wow. What a game. Im pullijg for Morocco thenrest of the way
Absolutely crazy.. what a game. Congratulations to Morocco!  From Mexico!!
That is amazing....
Didn’t expect it… sad Spain is out… great job Morocco!
Nothing like 720p quality in 2022.
Why is this only at 720p?   I have a 86 inch TV and was expecting 4k or at least 1080!  Really Fox?
Let’s go Morocco!!!!
AYE ALHAMDULILAH 🎉
Congratulations morraco best glie ever
Wow
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Way to go 🇲🇦 👍👍👍👍
Portugal next and France in the semi, Morocco going for the colonizer sweep🧹
It was true for Japan.  It's true for Spain.  If you don't have the guts to send your spot kicks high, take up another sport.
This is wonderful news to wake up to
The first day I watch Morocco 🇲🇦 play I know who ever wanna get get out you have to hard they play different
hey @Foxsoccer you're mucking this up. Why not bother to show morocco's PKs on an already too short and poorly edited highlight reel?
Congratulations my moroccan 🇲🇦 team . And good luck to our friends and neighbors 🇪🇸
Here's looking at you Morocco! Well done!
Spain couldn't handle the pressure. MORROCO CAPITALIZE
Another african team that gets eliminated. Nobody can stop fifa fixing games.
🇲🇦👏👏👏
Proud of you Morocoo team 💗🇲🇦🇲🇦🇸🇾🇸🇾🇸🇾🇸🇾🇸🇾
Mexico stands with Morocco 🇲🇦
This match is sold
I don't know if there is award for the best goalkeeper in the tournament but bounou deserves that! 👏
Best African team bar none
Bono’s smile is everything ❤️🧿❤️🇲🇦🦁🇲🇦
Wow
Congratulations from el salvador
Man I love world cup season
Morocco uses the same colors as Portugal.
Morocco are my last hope!! My favorites Japan, South Korea, and USA are out. Go Morocco!
I am from Philippines 🇵🇭but I love Motroccow
this world cup proved that all countries have potential even the smallest insignificant country like El Salvador could someday win the world cup
jesus they took one of the best team out of the world cup... its gonna be a lil easier for them now to win. spain was a serious threat to everyone.
@spain 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
Bravo Maroco, well done!
🥹😃
WOW! Congrats Morocco!!!
The shootout was almost identical to Croatia vs Japan
why there is no Spain starting 11?
That's what they get for being so boring to watch. Congrats Morocco
You could see glimpses of what this team could be in that last game in 2018 vs Spain , amazing to see now they knocked Spain out .
Sergio still captaining loses? when will the Spanish federation ever learn? He’s been a liability for YEARS… only shined when Messi was carrying him. Bad captain! terrible shot at the end. Doesn’t matter; he’s finished. 💀
When you think you are si good bUt ood but can’t prove it , Spain showed no real determination
Congratulations to Morocco. All Africa is proud of you! 🇨🇩 from 🇺🇸.
SPAIN IS OFFICALLY  WASHED UP COUNTRY 🤣🤣🤣🤣. So bad at PK's too 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Spain has to take more shots and less endless passes back and forth, it’s like the whole team wants to get into the net as for penalties kick that was a disaster and a shame, they deserved their lost.
You guys got to stop highlight the penaltys. Show them all please
Just an hour ago I saw group of cars driving around Philadelphia and waving Moroccan and Palestinian flags. Congratulations team Morocco!!! 🥳
HOLY MOLY!!
Spain took some garbage PKs
I'm 💯% Spaniard from Galicia and all I have to say is Spain 🇪🇸 today let their country their fans and most of all themselves down by the way they played in this World Cup. Germany 🇩🇪 would've played a much better game then they did. As a matter of fact Italy 🇮🇹 would've done a better job. Spain has to be the laughing stock in the whole world 🌎. Come on really 3 missed penalties in a row!!!!!!!!!! I for one am through with them as a team. I gave them way to  many chances and this was the last time I will be 👀 watching my country play in any other matches. And on a personal note, I hope they don't win the Nation's Cup because they don't deserve it.
Just when I thought Japan had the worst PK I've seen in a while, here comes Spain.
Wow done Morocco
@4:33. Mother of all BOSS MOVES.
Spain can't score a penalty  Bunch of losers
First saw potential in them in fifa 13 when i saw taraabt , 5 star skills 81 pace 86 dribble ... and a rifle from distance.
Donovan's calls are so cringey. "I speak Spanish" is just a weird thing to say in that moment
Too early in the morning to distinguish red color is Spain or blue color is Morocco.
Definitely FOX DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING about soccer !!! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Glad Spain are out. Bunch of divers.
MOROCCO 🇲🇦 ZINDA BAAD,  MOROCCO 🇲🇦 ZINDA BAAD,  MOROCCO 🇲🇦 ZINDA BAAD
as an african im very happy for our neighbor morroco! make africa proud! from (cote d ivoire)
Good for them. Amazing
MOROCCOOOOO
This WC is wild!!! I'm so excited.
Why did Spain change their color? I realized it's Spain who is out of the game until the last minute...
let's goooooo, Morocco will be the world champion!
How come FOX is not showing Morocco penalties, but only Spain penalties. Disrespectful!
👏👏👏Morocco , well done 👏👏👏
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I think no praise is enough for Morroco players heart and effort, but a grossly overlooked fact is that Morroco has a really strong team. I just realized how well they have defended against Spain. Spain did not have any real chances despite dominating the possession. And Morocco do have teeth as their attackers are fast and skillful.
Wowwwwwww 😂
New international team has rose harvested their hard work their victories this team from Morroco.. Congratulations you deserve it indeed..
Spain was my favorite team and now it is 🇲🇦
Last two days of penalties have been very strange.
You are extremely hero of Africans man you beat unbeatable team of Spain man congratulations 🎉❤🎉
La Re-reconquista
If there was a team to upset someone I’m happy it’s Morocco! They deserved it more than Spain!
Hey i speak Spanish lol
i am happy for morocco
Congratulations to Morroco, but man this game should never have gone to penalties. Spain had at least two opportunities no decent scorer should miss, and Morroco had one. Also, what about that Spanish cross that went right across goal, the one that prompted the announcer to remark that there was no "blue shirt in the six yard box?". Where was the hustle?
Been supporting Morocco since the beginning, love from Mexico 🇲🇽 🇲🇦 🤙🏽
OMG.  Never saw this coming in 100 years
Again, SHOW ALL THE PENALTIES.  Stupid Fox Sports ruin everything they touch
Congrats
“Living rent free in Soler’s head,” that was cracking me up, and so true. That goalie was confident.
I realized Hakimi winning the game against his own country
Good job Morocco! I can't stand Spain
Let’s gooo !!
Después de la goleada a Costa Rica parecía que la selección española iba a por todas. Vaya decepción.
What a boring second half, Spain. You snooze you lose.
Spain looked like Japan today... passing the ball during penalties. Embarrassing.
Congrats 🎉 🎊 I said it before it’s the WOLD CUP you sleep in you got slapped hard OUT smh
Morocco vs Manchester city 😂
moral of the game for Spain" waste not want not"
Morocco inspiring other African teams not to be scared of big teams. Congrats to Morocco, they have been superb in this world cup campaign.
Morocco 🇲🇦 what a great team
Bravo 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
From a Bosnian Croat, congratulations to Morroco!!!  Great team with great people. 🇲🇦
Should've had De Gea in goal
Luis Enrique, the Spanish coach, is a very poor coach, he made so many mistakes. Bye.
Wow! Spaniard “Pitted Olives.”
Strange indeed, save for the kick off ther post, the Spaniards’ pls were relatively soft🧐🤷‍♂️
Miercoles🙉
Congrats 🇲🇦 🇲🇦 🇲🇦 🇲🇦
Let's go Morocco!
maradonaaaa
Wow!congrats 🎉Morocco,what an impressive game,I was on my feet all through the game.Congrats from Nigeria.
What the F happened to Spain shooters????
Love it! Well done Morocco! God Bless from Ireland!!
Morocco needs to work on accuracy and they will go further next time.
Españistan esta de luto ...  😪😪       😂😂😂😂
Crazy that Hakimi, the player that scored, is actually Spanish-born and was actually asked to represent the nation since his youth days. That must add a little extra sting in the Spanish's wounds 😭
All love to Morocco 🇲🇦 from Somalia 🇸🇴 congratulations, semi’s on the eyes Insha Allah
Good job Morocco
Over 1000 passes and one shot on goal
Morocco played really well!! They deserved it!! Hope they can challenge Portugal to a win!!
This is crazy
Bro all of these highlights have been under 5 min lol
Is debe de dar verguenza
Wrong move to leave David Dea
EPIC goalie! Congratulations Morocco, you make Africa proud!
So happy for Morocco! And you know the Moroccans are going to be naming a couscous plate after their goalkeeper! 😆 Must be awkward to be a Moroccan in Spain today! Or more likely a Spanish watching the Moroccans celebrate their defeat of Spain ...in Spain! 🤣
Like see Samba Brasilan, Tango,  Argentine or French Champagne 🍾
Spain was very disappointing today but Morocco didnt do much else to win except wait for the penalties. Well deserve win anyway and impressive record of goals against them, that says a lot.
Que paso ? No que muy vergas? ajjajajajajja JAJAJJA... Ha llorar a casa!!
Spain and Japan must have the same PK coaching. Congrats to Morocco! Well fought!
Spain leaned how to kick penalty from Japan.
How tf did Spain not even make a penalty?
Spain got paid for sure
The Moroccan Goalie won this
🤯🤯🤯🤯
Beautiful
Imagine Spain vs Japan at penalties. Never end.
Morocco 🇲🇦 did a fabulous job. Spain did an awesome work too. But in penalties someone had to win. En mi humilde, única y tal vez loca opinión, creo que España perdió por no haber aceptó pedir perdón a Mexico por la cruel, sangrienta, descabellada e inhumana conquista española en Mexico en los tiempos de Hernán Cortez. AMLO con humildad y soberanía les dio la oportunidad de disculparse y eso no pasó. Se que es muy I referente pero esa es my humilde opinión.
Morocco Goal keeper you are a big deal.
Nah, Finals it’s Messi (Argentina) vs Ronaldo (Portugal)—follow dah money!
The underdog story?
GOD DAM I DONT EVEN KNOW WHERE MOROCO IS IN THE WORLD
Hopefully this game spells the end of boring Spanish football. 75% of the possession and 1 shot on goal. Never again do I want to hear how good Spain are.
Morocco was absolutely amazing, Bravo Cabrones!!    Haughtiness and arrogance fell, that's why you have to be humble and never underestimate your rival!! cayo la arrogancia y soberbia, se creian superiores ya vieron que no, nunca hay que subestimar al rival ni en el juego ni en la vida misma!!
FOX SOCCER ⚽ is the best station to watch highlight matches
Yeah buddyyyyyyy 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
VIVE MARROC OHHHHHHH GOD FOOTBALL IS THE ONLY GAME ON EARTH !!!!!!!?????
Only 3 African teams made it to the quarters 🇨🇲🇸🇳🇲🇦
Came in here to watch the shootout, only showed Spains!😓
The world is with Morocco, if Brazil doesn't win the world cup I want Morocco to win it 🙌🏻
Congrats 🎉 Morocco 🇲🇦 from Philippines 🇵🇭 Asia supports you!
spain should've won
Two terrible, lazy runups for Spain penalties. Atrocious.
Why don't you show all penalty shoots? It's weird!
Spain was so boring Morocco 100% deserved to win 77% possession and 1 shot on target is a disgrace from Spain. Morocco looked more threatening with their attacks too.
Morocco shouldn’t stop right here ! Especially when you have the wind on your side taking to the right direction 🙂. Good luck to Morocco!
This was like the conquest repeated itself again
Congratulations Morocco!!
Now they can burn the rest of Belgium
Moore rock you🙌
Morocco Portugal gonna go like the Spain match up,,it’s going to go to penalties
Wallah
CONGRATULATIONS TO MARROC!!!!!! WOWWWWWWWWWWWW IT WAS AMAZING !!!!??
Why is everyone surprised about moroco like cmon now they been it but next won world cup
When is Spain (and Barcelona) gonna realize that Sergio Busquets is not only past his prime, but also below professional football's standard of fitness? His legs are not just slower, his entire reaction time is gone...
"Another One" DJ Khaled!!!!
OMG CONGRATS MOROCCO 🇲🇦 WOW WELL DESERVED AND EARNED… THIS WC IS EVERYTHING🔥🔥🔥🔥 I think they’re gonna beat their next opponent… they look good…
Spain get that airplane engine on. Time for you guys to leave 🤪🤪🤪🤪.
Cant even show the whole shoot out
Adiós España.
Shame on Spain football... goalkeeper was inferior to Moroccan and did not show any offensive at all. Hope Brazil or Argentina will do the trick and play better football.
MashaAllah brothers !!! Muslim brothers of the USA 🇺🇸 are with you !!!
This World Cup gets wilder and wilder 😂😅
I hate shootouts in soccer. It puts too much pressure on the goaltenders. They should just keep playing instead.
Assalamualaykum Morocco! Congrats!
Imagine if Africa as 1 nation had just 1 Team??
It would be nice if they posted the full shootout and not just the misses
Wowwwwwwww
let's go morocco
Hwy don’t you show all penalty shoot out , you skipped 3 Moroccan penalties, such a shame for FOX
Congrats to Morocco! Well deserved!!
I hate penalties at this junction.
Lol I didn’t see not one African
Great game 🎯
Please win against Portugal in the qf 😀
Well done guys!
bono MVP
NIGERIA rocking with MOROCCO...go where no other country has gone before!!!!
Congrats to Morocco from New York City. The goalkeeper was incredible
Unbelievable... Congrats Morocco.. well done 👍🏻✅
Luis bring barca in and they out barca is done
Good that trash spain team is out so glad
Shout out to the "amazing" editing group who don't show Morocco's first two penalty kicks. Like a horrible cooked steak, well done.
Wow I hate to be in Spain right now lol….great job Morocco!
Spain deserved it 😂😂
spain 🤣😂
Simply Spectacular! This one is for Africa ! Viva Morocco 🇲🇦
All Spanish penalty takers were so nervous, they gave out the scared vibe
Congrats moroccoooooooo🇵🇸❤️🇲🇦
Why can’t they just show all the goals in the penalty shootout?
pathetic penalty kicks by Spain and then their goalie couldn't even be patient enough to wait for the ball to be kicked letting them soccer easy 🤦‍♂️
Morocco plays anti football
From Honduras 🇭🇳 congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦
gingerly done penalties by Spain.
Morocco got the chance to end the game twice as early as it did, great win thou
what
🤲🏻🤲🏻🇮🇳🙏🏾🙏🏾💪👏
It pays to have a Zyiech and Hakimi. Plus a GK in great form 👌
all these pen shootouts are looking suspiciously soft, like maybe there's a script????
We proud of you Morocco 🇲🇦🇸🇳🇸🇳❤️💪
Spain is so shamed by this loss, Fox Sports didn't show their starting 11 on this clip😄  Fox, tell your commentators to leave their divisiveness in their dressing rooms...end of the match, suddenly its all these "North" designations...the Iberian Itch was beaten by an AFRICAN (past Africa Cup winners, I might add) squad today. Congrats Morocco,
Demostrado los españoles no son nadie nadie los penales no son para cualquiera solamente wl comandantw es wl perro del area ,
Morocco is easy for Portugal 😅.  Or who they gonna face on next round..!!   Can someone explain
I am so proud of Morocco. Spain played better. But only one team moves on. The Moroccan goalie was the best today.
Morocco will make history ❤
Now PSG thoughts - "we must have a contract with moroccan goalkeeper!" Lol
Africa and all the scattered people taken from the continent is with u Morocco 🇲🇦
Bruh give that Moroccan goalkeeper a raise
New vid up (channel smoking with dez)

The Football angels are smiling at Morocco 🇲🇦
Barcelona lost in a major competition again 😂😂😂
Morocco is more like South Spain (Berber, European) or West Middle East (Mediterranean) than African.
1.7 Billion people were all Moroccans today (All Africa and all Arab world)
Those penalties by Spain were so bad 🤣🤣
both goalkeepers played very well
Dang…
I'm so upset but either way congrats to Morocco
WE DID IT. 🇲🇦🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
spain doing pk worst than Japan Lol.
Wow! 😮 shocking . Go Morocco
Congratulations
I told my brother Spain gonna lose then he started laughing lol he ain’t laughing now
LFG MOROCCO!!! Last African team standing make us proud
I'm so mad I missed this game live 😤
When Sarabia came on last minute I knew he was going to miss the penalty, but I would never guessed they all would miss.
spain sucks
Great underdog story
Congratulations Morocco 🎉well deserved from a Mexican
Nice 😂😂😂😂
Group E(Spain & Japan) went out of the tournament through penalty shootout
Go Morocco.  Do the Waddle!!!!!!
All the blessings and love to Morocco from Iran!!! I am rooting for you all the way brothers!
Nous gagnons Maroc 🇲🇦
Hey Fox! Why you didn’t show 🇲🇦 Morocco penalty kicks ? You only showed Spain!
Congrats to these good brothers !!
This is why Soccer is the best sport in the world! Another David Vs. Goliath scenario! Congratulations Morocco and Africa!!!
si esto no fue un equipo de un-profesionales, yo no se lo que es un profesional... Sin estrategia, sin juego en profundidad, si ideas de como romper la barrera, y sin arriesgar nada, lo mejor que le podia pasar a España es ser eliminarla, como asi fue, pero ademas por un equipo que casi ni conoce lo que es un balon redondo, VERGUENZA!
Agree, the money is on Messi vs Ronaldo finals. Keep your eyes opened, folks!
This World Cup has been full of surprising performances ever
I love ❤️ 😍 💖 morocco 🇲🇦
Morocco🇲🇦 told Spain🇪🇸 you will not win not today.
“ this stadium is absolutely rockin…” MOROCCAN that is 🤣😜
Thank you my Moroccan brothers for making Africa proud love from  Ghana.
Obviously the team the rest of the world wants to win.  LET'S GO, MOROCCO!!
I love the world cup
Long live Muhammad
So sad spain lose 😢
Great job Morocco!!!! 😁😁✌🏾✌🏾   Looks like the path was not so smooth for Spain...
Bounou had a performance of his career 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
Unbelievable. Morocco made is happened.
It is so boring to see Spain playing. Good for Morocco.
Wow que gran equipo eliminan a uno de Los Mas grandes en LA historia de Los mundiales.
Crazy
I will root for Morocco 😎 from a Mexican brother🤠
These stupid americans!!! How do you do a highlight video and skip some of the penalty kicks?????
Good for all africans
i don't know which one worse--morocco is homophobic and spain is racist.
❤❤❤❤
The Lions of Atlas victorious once again. Will we see them in the final?
Hahahaha😂
Finally an upset
Spain teams are built with great players from outside of their country. Money won’t buy them the World Cup though lol
Que bueno que perdió España porque es muy aburrido ver su estilo de juego.
Tenían que aver patiado a la izquierda y más suave
Morocco could use messi🎉
Wow! 🤣🤣🤣
The country that hates to be African is making Africa proud. Interesting world cup.
This world cup is full of surprises
Bravo
I have never seen something like this in any football game total Defeat
Could have shown moroccos first pens
As a neutral  fan I liked both teams, happy for Morocco , great to see a new name fighting  for the world title, happy to see their fans celebrating, good luck!
Congrats to Morocco from USA 🇺🇸
Why wouldn’t you show all the penalties? Fox sucks
Felicidades  a Marrueco por su triunfo bien merecido de  parte de un Mexicano
I hate this sport sometimes, it seems like a game of luck. I hate when the worse team goes through it feels undeserved.
Yo shoutout to that Moroccan Goalkeeper <3
The Re-Reconquista
Who is the idiot who took the PK and celebrated like he was God? All glory to the GK you narcissist.
Have you seen him, Moroccan goalkeeper????EPIC! Wow, Morocco… just… wow!!!!
Marrocco va Portugal whoever wins gets to keep the colors and uniform
Great win by Morocco. Amazing job by the goalkeeper. BUT ... these penalty kick matches make me wish there were a better way: you play 100+ minutes of great soccer, and then it basically comes down to a coin flip whether the keeper guesses correctly or not. It's very dramatic and tension-filled, but doesn't have much relationship to the actual game. What if after a certain amount of time, if they are still tied, the number of players on the pitch starts to be reduced every five minutes or so?
The Spaniards came up with this famous phrase "El que perdona pierde." Spain had 2 pole hitters one on the last minute and the first penalty the phrase came to life
1019 passes no goals so glad we won't have to watch them anymore
God I’m so annoyed. Morocco are so undeserving of that win. They are probably the worst quarter finalist in the last 40 years. It’s not like Spain looked good but they didn’t look as vulnerable. But Morocco looked like they could’ve lost at any moment. 7 at the back is even more boring than Spain’s meaningless passing. It was a terrible game where the worse team went through imo.
why didn’t you show Moroccos penalty goals?
thats the kind of match i wanted to see
All they need is one star player for finishers.
It's funny that the two teams that emerged from the group of death have both been eliminated due to their terrible penalty kicks.
Thanks for everyone who supported Morocco from 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 and the rest of the world. WE LOVE YOU 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦 🇲🇦❤️🇺🇸
Horrible penalty kicks by Spain.. they tried to go for the angle with fínese and had no strength in their kicks
Previous powerhouses and World Cup Champions are falling like flies. Germany and now Spain are gone. Let us see who will fall next. So far my crystal ball picks Brazil to win it all. It will be Brazil vs France in the FINAL. Who do you pick to win it all?
Take the kids in diapers from Barcelona to the world cup they can't score they can't kick a penalty 🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
Freaking insane. Day by day.
That lovely they showed who wanted it more
That Spain team got told by everyone that they were the better team, and they believed it.
Spain wont be able to drink from the world cup.  Lol
FINALLY! A country other than the typical European and South American country to advance to the quarter finals! Congrats Morocco!! From South Korea!!
WOW!!  Way to go Morocco!
Spain deserved to go out with those penalties, so obvious on which direction they're going
Beautiful  country of dignity  God bless  Morroco
FINALLY AN UNDERDOG WIN I. The knock out stages. I’m was getting TIRED to see big nations advancing. Because it was really BORING to see the same things advancing. Like COME ON WORLD CUP GIVE ME AN UNDERDOG!!!! Congratulations Morocco from the USA the comfiest country that Morocco recognized as a nation.🇺🇸👍🔥
Hahhahahahahahah😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 hahahahhahahahahaha
I like to see how other countries are improving their fútebol/soccer. It makes the championship better. Congratulations for the  Marroco team From Brasil.
Enrique arrogance got him exactly what he deserves. He should lose his job effective immediately and get forced pay for his travel expenses back home.
PSG represent! Hakimi with the winning goal!
Wow
Well….. there goes my bracket prediction down the toilet…..
My grandma sold her kidney to see Spain win and Spain lost 👺💀
Would've been nice to see Morocco's penalty kicks
Amazing defense from 🇲🇦!!! ❤❤ congrats guys 🙏 Bono is awesome 🤩
what a game!!! bono definitely earned man of the match. see you guys after winning 1-0 against France to the final against Argentina.
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦 from  Trinidad and Tobago 🇹🇹 and Etats Unis (USA) 🇺🇲
So happy for Morocco and their fans!  Soak it in and get ready for the next round!!!
Spain so weak right now, barely got out of group and lost to Morocco
Lets go Morocco.   From U.S.A
Wow, indeed the race is not to the swift, the battle is not to the strong...
The return of the Moors
Bro those penalties from Spain look very suspicious. Why they all shoot soft and not well place?
Congratulations 🇲🇦🎈🎊
Alhamdullah!!
Spain and Japan players need to learn how to take pks
Karma is up …remember German
I knew it before the game started that they would win this game. 🎉 amazing congratulations again from the rest of the world. You guys are playing super great
To all my brothers and sisters from Morocco congratulations,from a football fan of Central America,much love..Viva Marruecos..
It’s as if the goalie knew exactly where the ball was going to be WOW! 😮
Yeah, Brazil is winning the whole thing.
It’s all rigged and fixed  Brazil going win World Cup  FIFA is corrupt  Research it on you tube
3 0
Y’all are savage I wanted to see Morocco penalty goals but instead gave us Spain misses.
So happy for them. That's a thing I loved: it's the knockout stage, and there's no point in locking yourself in defending hoping fot the shootout; Morocco showed up with a super-offensive 4-1-2-3, keeping Spain busy and not allowing them to attack the whole game. That's the way to go!
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉congratulations
biggest upset of the Cup
Spain, the most overrated team of the tournament
Congrats Morocco!
Let’s gooooooooo
Muslim power ❤
Congrats, Morocco!! Happy for you. Well deserved! Greetings from 🇲🇽
Delicious! Wonderful.
JOKE
wow! wow! wow! speechless loool Congrats to Morocco ! what a goalie!! that is confidence and no doubt or fear!! Bravo!!!
Why is spain wearing ugly light blue kits?  3:55 what a sick save
you should put all penalties in this highlight review.
Massive upset.  Congrats to Morocco for making history.
Congrats Morocco...see you in the finals vs Brazil.
Yassine Bounou won the Champions League by saving so many penalties, now shining again at the world cup. Top 3 GK in the world.
So happy for Morocco, the Spaniards looked to be coasting after there 7 to 0 win in there first game , however Japan were all over them and Morocco may have taken a leaf from there play book. Fantastic victory .I hope whoever they play in the next game they go on to the semifinals .
Did he really do the Jalen Waddle touchdown dance after the final goal? 😂🐬
MOROCCO TO THE MOON AND BACK🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦 From Ghana🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭:D
Just wowoowow. Amazing.
Y Bono the real Moroccan 🇲🇦 lion 🦁Octopus 🐙, what a conference during game 💪
This is a message to all of us. The power of presrevernce and hard work proved to the World. That Impossible is not moroccan . Keep fighting for what you dream of and it will pays at the end .
Congrats from Turkiye!
The goalkeeper of Morocco was the real MVP there in that game
Bien por Marruecos
My God, this is the same Spain that shattered Costa Rica with a 7-0 score? They really meet their match today 😮‍💨
Bravo Morocco !!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Unbelievable performance. Incredible defense. Everyone gave 100 percent. I feel so proud and I’m sure every Moroccan fan is too. ❤
Japan inspired, yes anybody can do it!
The victory dance at the final penalty was amazing, Morocco deserved this win
This World Cup is full of surprises, upsets, and heartbreaks/jubilation
Congratulations to Morocco‘s current golden generation in taking Morocco to the Quarter finals for the first time.   Morocco is still undefeated in this world cup after five games and I have a feeling that they will continue to surprise us  Morocco: the Real dark horse of this tournament 🙏🏻🇲🇦
Woooow, unbelievable, this goal keeper . Good job, 🇲🇦 Morocco   Keep the good work 👏 🙌 👍
It's football shouldn't be political when it's LGBTQ rights but then Morocco celebrate with a Palestinian flag. That whole region is joke
where is Morocco Penalty Shot ? your racist
Congrats all Africans, Morocco has made us proud as the only remaining African team, what a performance.
Morocco's defense was superb as it has been throughout this tournament, and they absolutely deserve this win. Big congratulations! I just feel that if they are to win again they'll need to do much better at the other end in terms of finishing - their upfield motion can indeed be quick, inventive and strong but they really lack that final sharpness and precision that the other teams still standing do have. Spain suffered the same, I feel, and the penalties were super tame. Still, kudos to all for making it this far and good luck to Morocco!
الف الف مبروك للمغرب الحبيب العظيم علي هذا الانتصار العالمي وان شاء الله يطلعون اعلي واعلي لكاس العالم وياخذوه . الف تحيه الجولكي الي صد ضربات الجزاء الثنتين . حارس ممتاز. وين يلعب الحارس هذا
Napenda sana twende Africa
I don’t know why Enrique excluded (David de Gea), but he made a wrong decision
Allah u Akber
Bye Spain
Why you idio ts didn’t get morocco’s penalties
Thank you Morocco for avenging us Costa Ricans <3
11 guys playing defense, of course that leaves Spain playing possession football with limited attacking options. All Morocco had to do was to remain organized at the back. This game was all about patience. Morocco was waiting for Spain to overload the pitch and catch them of guard with a massive counter attack. On the other hand, Spain was waiting patiently for the Moroccan defense to fatigue, and catch them out of position for scoring opportunities but it never happened for both sides. Both sides played well but the Moroccan defense was a master piece and very enjoyable to watch.
Mes freres Marocains je suis fier de vous.. on y va pour la demi finale
Spain is technically skilled and does a great job maintaining possession by keeping a good shape but they are overall a slow, unathletic team and that lack of athleticism is killing them in World Cups.  I don't think pure tiki taka cuts it in modern soccer anymore.
NO TEAM HAS SCORED ON MOROCCO ALL WORLD CUP
Good job Morocco 👏
Wow! Whata disappointment by this Spain team!🥵
Morocco committed a jihad on the Spain.
At this point nothing is luck… teams have to fight hard to make it.. congrats Morocco
Congratulation morocco I’m greeting from East Africa somalia we The dream cup come true let’s bring World Cup home Africa championship
F…..Luis Enrique that put all barcelona players there including busquet and praising him like the best in the team while barcelona is getting rid of him
Wow this was the biggest upset yet. Moroccans deserved this. Their defense was superb!!!
España Al carrer 😂😂😂
THREE FOR THREE SAVES IN PENALTY SHOOTOUT ARE YOU KIDDING ME!! Unbelievable performance by Morocco, well deserved victory, congrats
They needed DeGea
Me: laughs in African  (Edit: I am saying that as a Nigerian I’m am supporting any African success and laughing a Spain collectively i am not saying African is a language)
Oh my God! Oh my God! Morocco 🇲🇦 my love some of us are crying here in Ethiopia 🇪🇹 tears of joy. Congrats you made us proud again. Keep shining in the eyes of this world. Africa is watching you bring the cup home and make history. Yes you can!!
DIESOFCRINGE
This is wildin
Congrats to Morocco. What a match and what a tournament so far by them.  Wish for more good fortune to come!
Congratulations morocco 🇲🇦 🎉❤🇲🇦😁
Why are you not showing the kicks that make it in for the shootout lol.
Spain could not score even in penalties lol
Congratulations Morocco
Thank you 🙏🏼 Morocco 🇲🇦 saying hi from Somalia 🇸🇴 made us all proud ❤..
Congrats to Morocco 🇺🇸❤🇲🇦
Oh my.
❤❤❤ I’m happy to the depths of my heart for the Atlas Lions of Morocco! The pure joy of the Moroccan people on this occasion is electrifying at the very least.
Congratulations to Morocco this win is for one of my favorite Moroccan player Mustapha Hadji. Love from Ghana 🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
Those were the weakest PKs I’ve ever seen
Moroccan goalkeeper Bono was on fire, excellent saves during the penalty kick shootout!
winning the shootout by chipping down the middle is crazy, shout-out to Hakimi and congrats to Morocco 🇲🇦
Morocco 🇲🇦  hoyee  🇹🇿
Well done Morocco. Keep it up.
I still cant believe it! Lets go Africa!
Supposedly Spain wanted to get second place in their group to avoid Brasil and Argentina. Massive backfire there!  😬
Mo-rockin🎉🎉🎉
😂😂😂 alors Enrique on dit quoi ??
am here again to say i love you guys..............Morocco to the world
Dang Morocco, if the sheets get any cleaner, they would have to open a laundry service! Spain couldn’t even score a goal on penalty kicks?!?!
Good luck morocco
Spain 🇪🇸 intentionally lost to Japan 🇯🇵 on purpose jus to play Morocco 🇲🇦 instead of them playing Croatia 🇭🇷 thinking that Morocco 🇲🇦 was gonna be a very easy ride for them back it back fire on them 😂
Morocco is barely Africa...people need to calm down and not try to make it look like they are black lol
The Dark horse team in morocco does it again, superb!!
The goalie is goated
Very proud of my African brothers. Go Morocco 🇲🇦
Congratulations Morocco, am from Nigeria, keep making Africa proud
I'm extremely happy for my Moroccon brothers. Khalid from Pakistan
Fifa is rigged
Hats off to Morocco 👏👏
Congrats to Morocco on the HUGE upset over a staked Spain team!!!
Good job my African brothers. Right now, Morocco is carrying the hope of all Africans and Arabs.
Impressive
That's what I say Don't subestimate! N enemy.
Bounou!!!! Good Job Morocco
Don't get why you wouldn't just show all the penalties
That shows the level of Africa soccer. Never sleep on Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, or Morocco.
Wow. I'm not going to lie, this is shocking and I was not expecting this result!
Morocco's goalie is the best player of all the World Cup.
Finally, an upset in the round of 16. Good!
please include all penalty kicks in the highlights
Uh, highlights that don’t even show every penalty shot?
We are the dreamers and we believe in it 🇲🇦
Whatt they get for losing on purpose to Japan to play an “easier” team Morocco 😂😂 what they get choose the easy path you get spanked shoulda kept Germany in woulda put on a much better show lol
now you see how corrupting Fifa is , right ! :D. All game is set up obviously that people can expose it easily. Spain missed 3 penalties in a row. Wow. Come on! If you dont think it is set up by Gambling Companies in Vegas, then you might have not never gambled before. 99% of people bet on Spain, now Gambling companies are collecting all money
Niceeeeeeeee,⚽️⚽️⚽️👍👍👍
How lackluster those shots were by Spain, normally one would think a payoff, but knowing how much the World Cup means to Spain, IT IS CLEAR MOROCCO IS THE VICTOR… and on another note, I ALWAYS root for Spain to loose, always 😂
Another long night for Belgium's riot police and cleaning crew.
Alhamdulillah
Wow🎉 Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦 ❤🇳🇬👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Those spain players should have been the last option to take a penalty lol..
SPAIN kicking those penalties with no power at all. UNBELIEVABLE....
Spain choked hard. Couldn’t score in regulations nor freebies. Hey Japan, you’re off the hook 😂
Whoever edited this video: where are the Moroccan goals? You must be from Spain 🇪🇸 😭😭😭
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Next: B-R-A-Z-I-L out!!!!!!!
Any chance of actually showing the goals in the penalty shootout in the World Cup knockout stages????
I can't believe Mexico just beat Morocco & Spain in penalties. Amazing game, CONGRATS essays!
4:37 ashraf 🤣👌👌👌👌👌
Why u cut off the Moroccan penalties ?? Stupid editors
Alhamdulillah! Congratulations Morocco! 🎉❤
Morocco played like a future Champion. First African country to win the world cup? We'll see!
Why show all the Spanish PKs and only 1 of Morocco?
Etoo said this cup is between cameroon or morocco no one belief him. Wow
Outstanding! 👏
Unbelievable performance by Morocco... hope they make it to the semi's for sure!
That’s crazy when Spain has all that talent and can’t even score one point?!  Where is God on this?
With a congested 28-day schedule, teams should go straight to penalties after 90 minutes. It's a waster of energy on both teams and waste of time on the audience
Fantastic job Morocco!!! 🇲🇦 love from Bolivia 🇧🇴
Spain with out S
Imagine a Japan vs Span pk showdown, be there all day
Japan: man we choked in PK Spain: say no more
You seriously cut out the first three Moroccan penalties from the highlights? FOX Soccer coverage knows no bounds of being f*cking sh*t!
No goal Spanish 😂
Wow! Congrats. Go all the way, win the cup and make history.
From Somalia 🇸🇴🇸🇴🇸🇴 ألف ألف مبرووك للأسود الأطلس🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦 هذا الفوز خاص لأهل المغرب الكبير ولكل العرب والمسلمين كرة القدم لعبة الرجال والتكتيك اللي لعب فيه المغرب اليوم بخطين وسط ودفاع متماسك وحارس محترف الفوز بهذه الكأس ليست حلم بل حقيقة
Every game has the same lame music in the beginning.
The penalty shootout from Spain was bad…
Long love Africa ❤ I’m happy for my North African brothers victory . Much respect ✊🏿
Is it me or Spain did not try to beat Japan just to get rid of Germany and avoid Croatia? Not sure it was a wise decision... and that guy "Bono", is he the one from U2? 😀
Spain off to practice penalties
They deserve it for our Moroccan brothers and sisters, and good luck for the Spanish friends.. Moroccan player No. 21 missed goals
you have to chop the ball with left at this moment 3:12
Amazing!
Wished they showed the entire penalty kick shootout
I bet Spain is regretting letting Japan win. They thought they would have an easier time with Morocco than croatia.
Morocco needs a good scorer.
WOOOOOOW, this right here is powerful indeed, look at these young men from Morocco show how the world will eventually catch up to the elites, congradulations to them and to the many Afican nations that celebrate with Morocco
I am all alone in this world and have no one with whom to celebrate and share my unbridled happiness but I GIVE GOD THANKS!!
Congratulations to all my Moroccan Brothers from Iran. I'm so glad you made to Top . I have been cheering for your ever since my Team was eliminated.  Your Goal keeper is also great. Love and Best of Lucks. You can even become the champion 🏆
Wow 😱
Karma is a beauty. Spain allowed Japan to beat them to eliminate Germany and go against the "weaker" rival in Morocco and avoid Crostia. Now they are at home. Cheaters
WOW
who is the idiot that edited this? The least you could do is to show all the penalties.
Congratulations Morocco 🎉from Mexico.
If that was France or England losing to any African team, ESPN, SkySoorts would attack all the Black players and Harry Kane. But watch Spain get a pass.
Ending the Games like that is so Stupid
رحم الله شيخنا الحبيب د.فريد الأنصاري و اسكنه الفردوس الأعلى
Why not just show the whole spot kicks
the best, goal keeper ❤
why when I watch these types of games the only thing that comes to my mind is the Queen song after the final whistle
Now that is a full stadium cheering for morocco 🇲🇦 ❤😂😂😂 I love it it’s beautiful let’s go Morocoo the World Cup is yours
Morocco’s manager was right, Spain puts everyone to sleep
Now that the U.S. is out the team I'm backing now is Morocco. (For reasons of bandwagoning)
Morocco the whole world rejoices with you!!!! Great job!!!!  Africa &  Asia ...you both have made football proud!!!
ALL THANKS AND PRAISE be unto GOD ALMIGHTY who has gifted ALL MOROCCANS EVERYWHERE, AND THE WORLD AT LARGE, with so much HAPPINESS and PRIDE through this HISTORIC win. PRAISE AND BLESSINGS BE HEAPED UPON HIS HOLY AND DESERVING NAME FOREVERMORE. THANK YOU LORD!!
🇲🇦  the black horse of the world cup never never underestimate  your rival on a world cup.
That's two games decided on penalty kicks that had one team fail to score the first three attempts -- you do NOT want to start with your weaker pen shooters as going behind right from the start makes it harder for everyone that follows and energizes the opponent.  Japan were terrific in this cup but just like Spain they blew the pens.
Spain !!! Prepare to get destroyed as soon as you get home !!!
بلاد العرب اوطاني ، الف الف مبارك للمغرب العربي الف مبارك لقلوب العرب اللي فرحتونا بفوزكم  فرحتكم فرحة ملايين العرب 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
That goalie going to get a contract from a team after the World Cup
Hakimi so cold with the chip 🥶
Im almost as happy as when Brazil Thrashed SKorea
Congrats Morocco, who ever is editing these 4 minute clips should get replaced by someone who likes this sport! They do not show replays when they almost score and not showing Morocco scoring their penalties, pretty lame like they  just trying  to get the job done, no pride in their work, or no knowledge on the beautiful game.
Why didn't they show the Moroccan taking the penalty? They deserve the spot light!
Adios amigos 👋👋👋
Why did fox sports not show the two goals that morroco scored hmm 😮
Does everyone forgot how to shoot penalties? All this slow walks 🚶‍♀️ to the ball? Wack af
Spain played so so bad. They missed so many chances.
This world Cup has Been amazing to watch
Don't understand Busquets ahead of Rodri in the midfield. Busquets too slow
Dont call it an upset Morocco has been the better team all tournament. Spain avoids Brazil and lose to Morocco i cant say i didnt see it coming.
They were lucky with their goalkeeper. Game play was bad
Ball Possession and passing over 1000 times is no longer football soccer matches are changing history was played here by the rocking  Moroccans well deserved win 👏 👍
Didn't see that coming. Congratulations Morocco.
Spain 🇪🇸 out -makes me happy, and I can’t wait the Switz beat Portugal 🇵🇹 today.
What is the song in the beginning
This World Cup is full of upsets. Wow.
Morocco make Africa proud
Spain wish they had taken kepa
Where are the morocco's penalty kicks?
No power behind those kicks from Spain for the penalties wth was that?
Someone explain to me why Sergio busquets is still playing well let me ask this instead why is he the captain he’s a horrible captain we can tell by the way he is in Barcelona oh I forgot the head coach is a Barcelona fan and ex manager jajaja nvm
Thank you Morocco. German fans happiest day in 2022
O god, so much emotion, so much energy.. gotta give props to the Moroccans 👏😢
Wow... simply wow.
Congrats Morocco!
Congrats Morocco from senegal🇸🇳
Congratulations Morocco
Epic Fail
1,000 passes and 1 shot on target, just completely boring and zero creativity football from the Spaniards. I thought Japan's PK's were horrendous yesterday, and Spain topped them 😂
Spain yucky. Moroccans let’s go
Congrats,  Morocco!!
That last penalty by Morocco was soooo cheeky!
Hakimi's penalty 🥶
Did dude just do the Waddle? Lol
Africa is really sticking it to Europe for all their colonialization!
I can’t believe my eyes
Vive le Maroc
Morocco is the new Brazil
And some people said Spain lost to Japan on purpose because they rather play Morocco for easy win 😂
Wow. What nerve wracking game. Congrats Morocco!
Morocco thanks for proudly representing Africa. The entire continent is supporting you. Love from Liberia ❤️
Morocco is shocking the world
At last an African team goes higher…The commentators were talking as if it was Goliath Vs David…but Morocco is the David and they won.All the way to the final.Mark my word!
Congratulation Morocco
The First Arab country and the 4th African Team to go to the Quarter-Finals!!!!
I want a African team to win let’s go morroco  let’s get it 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Morocco!  This is so great to see a team outside of S. America or Europe advancing to this level! I hope they go further (i.e., all the way!!). Much love from Ireland (our team needs improvement!)!
Unbelievable !!!   Bono is a superstar !
Spain sucked anyway
Beautiful!
Quarterfinals: Next match is winner of Portugal/Swiss. Semifinals: Then winner of England/France.  Final: Then World Cup
Ghosts of Japan entered the bodies of Spain haha! 🤡
When are playing African cup of nation …yes they are Africans but they don’t consider themselves as Africans because of their color.But they are Arabs but we are in the same continent and we are one people
I'm speachless :O Spain literally did the same thing Japan did :( they took the easy safe shots and unfortunately they were to predictable smh
Spain’s offense was offensively bad
ALL of Africa is standing proudly. Love to Morocco!!!!
Moroccan goalkeeper is a national hero for his nation today!!! Wow!
That’s what you get for being boring Spain!
Congrats to Morocco !!! Spain played good this tournament but this game they played horrible and deserve to be kicked out.Sloppy penalty kicks cost them the tournament.Love and respect to Morocco from Bosnia
Congratulations #Morroco ❤️   on  Beating that #spain 🤡
If there is a will there is a way,as long as the ball is round anything is possible,congratulations homies.
not only is he a great musician!!!  but also a great goalkeeper !!!!  bono is awesome!!!!
happy for rocos!
Although I do not like Morocco for keeping Saharawis captives, I'd like that it beats Spain.
1000,000,000 Mabrook
What is going on 😳
Wow. Don't know anyone on either team, but kinda wanted Spain to advance. Course. When the crowd is so amped up, it's fun to see. I would think a Spanish dude would want a 'shootout' to decide the winner. Didn't turn out that way. Blanked 3 times in a row. That's not the best face to show your amped up fans at home, streaming the match. I do like this seeming reality that 'some' sports victories give you a great feeling, months, years, later. Morocco is building a memory. Interesting to see when it ends . . or not.
simply wow Marroco! Goalie was amazing, HakimI is special and the whole team is just incredible. Congratulations!
Yaks!
🎉
Congratulations Morocco, from USA 🇺🇸 👏 🙌
Thanks lord for answering my prayer
SPAIN and GERMANY turn out to be more disappointing than I thought during this World Cup. My prediction has been either France of Brazil to win the title from the beginning
Japan: We're terrible at pens Spain: Hold our cerveza
Why is only one of the Moroccan kick shown??
❤❤❤❤❤
Hooooooooo
Why did Sergio take the slowest penalty ever
So happy for Morocco  - I want them to win the Cup! Lets go Morocco... love from India!
everyone was rooting for Morocco...except Spain
Bruh
1st and foremost Congratulations to Morocco.The number 2 from Morocco did the Waddle dance, probably a Maimi Dolphins fan.. that was soo cool
Love you Morocco🇲🇦 from 🇵🇰 Pakistan!!!!!❤ yessss!!!!!!!
🇲🇦 ❤️
It was a good time for Morocco to be the winner.  I guess Spain though,  they are a better team,  but you never have to make less to your contender.  Good for Morocco,  congratulations!
What a cheeky last pen loved it
Love this.... this year an underdog definitely needs to win
CONGRATS Morocco inshallah World cup winner🤲
Morocco was awful. Only play dirty lol Ref was bought by Qatar
That was beautiful by the GoalKeeper. Insane how this World Cup has gone.
Mashallah Maraco 🙏
Goosebumps. Congrats Maroc
Morocco woke up and decided they will bring meaning to the word Pain in Spain lmao
SR4 laughing 😂
Wow how pathetic they should just end themselves
What a poor showing from Spain
ما شاء الله تبارك الله يا إخوانا المغربيين الف الف مبرووووووك
honestly those saves weren't anything special Spain choked worse then Japan ik Ramos is laughing rn..
Yesterday and today! Wow
Well done Morocco
Allah is with Morocco 🇲🇦
Go Morocco go
🇲🇦💕🇲🇦💕🇲🇦💖💖⚽🇺🇸
DO ANY OF THE TEAMS PRACTICE PENALTY KICKS? LOOKS LIKE AMATEUR HOUR
Show all the shots in pens! Why only the misses!
congratulations morocco soccer team !!
Barcelona out of the World Cup!
Let's go morocco 🇲🇦  💙  🇸🇴
How come you guys didn't show all penalties ?!?
Yalla habibi
Spain deserves to loose that,...wtg Morock
A goalie that can dive very well both sides is amazing
This World Cup dif
Just when we thought Japan's PK were bad.... Spain's was even WORSE!
Love Spain but Morocco totally deserves this win. What a hard working,  disciplined,  technical team, well done Morocco!
Wow
Horrible highlights but what a surprise maybe they should've taken less Barça players
Always too easy to second guess failed penalties, but not one of them had any pace on the ball. Weird.
Why is only the last penalty kick of Morocco shown in the highlights??
The only thing worse than Spain this tournament is Fox's coverage. Woeful.
Congratulations to Morocco!
Morocco began the match looking forward to penalty shootout, having the confidence in their impeccable goalkeeper. This is why they had a clean defense with very few fouls.
Siga hablando de penales señor DT 😝
This goalie tho, what a beast! So deserves to wear that smile at 4:19. Morocco all the way!
Amaaaaazing!!!!!
I wish my well corrupted Mexico will once show balls like Morocco did.. great job you earned it guys !!! Best of wishes for you!!!
Brovooooooo Morocco !!!!
This is karma for Spain beating that one team 7 goals up
What a shock
🎉🎉🎉مبروك
Marroco played amazing! People sleeping on them. Watch them make it all the way to the final
Big congrats to Morocco you made it and well deserved.  From Sénégal 👋
Wow 🤯🤯
Morocco 🇲🇦 is not in Africa
Morocco 🇲🇦 all the way 🙌 👏
"Spain shouldn't be rewarded for losing against Japan" THEY WEREN'T!
moroco and japan same conditions
Spain's problem isn't that they're a young team, its that they can't score goals.  They don't have a striker like Torres or Villa to finish off their passing moves.
Morocco congrats from a Nigerian America.  They're repping Africa and the Arab world so they have alot of people with them..
Espain !!! You have to improve you penalty shoot out. Very poor performance on penalty
Mashallah
3:40.
I'd say I would never expect a team scoring absolutely nothing when you said it went down to penalty.
😍🎶👍💕💕
Maybe one day Spain will understand that you can't win an adult competition with a group of prepubescent (and average for the most part) kids. This is a men's sport, not a U17 tourney.
What's the name of the music that plays in the beginning of every match???
I have feeling that this 2022 WC is hiding a BIG time secret winner ...
can you guys not cut out some of the penalty kicks? Would very much like to see every shot taken.
Morocco 🇲🇦 for ever from 🇸🇳 🇸🇳
🇵🇸🇲🇦 🇵🇸🇲🇦 🇵🇸🇲🇦🎉🎉
No beautiful soccer , 11 players defending in their field for entire 120 minutes .
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Much love to Morocco from Egypt!!❤🎉
Sorry Espain !!! You are going back
Spain is so weird in blue.
Final is between France and Brazil. Congratulations to Morocco 🇲🇦
As a Dutchman, I approve this outcome!!!!!!!!! HUP HUP HOLLAND!!
The highlight videos suck
The quarter-finals deserve a non-European or South American side. Root for Morocco!
That guy who couldn't keep his legs right and lost the ball, that one is no footballer. They should get rid off him.
Enrique vete ya!
Congrats to Morocco!! 🇲🇦
fox coverage  sucks .
Wow Congrats to Morocco, what an accomplishment.  Congrats to Ashram Hakim, best full back in the world.
Y cuando van  a devolver Melilla y Ceuta a Marruecos?
Huge congratulations to Arfica. It's a big win for all the African Nations
Morocco you made us Africans proud congratulations.victory well deserved bravo 💪.
Go Africa..
Ho-Lee-💩!
Now people are going to understand Einesta and Xavi difference
Awesome performance Morocco 👏👏
the goal of Morocco won the Zamora trophy for the best goalkeeper in la liga
Interesting how Luis Enrique was boasting about his team after their first game, only to show up with no teeth against Morroco. Congrats to the dark horse.
I love how confident Moroccan goalie was he was smiling the entire time. Morocco Ftw
I see Moroccan advancing to semifinals !!!!!
Roman Saiss Limped himself to the quarter final. You cannot say it wasnt a deserved win. Great job Morocco.
Did that last guy who scored do "the Waddle"?   😆
A most unexpected turn of events
Morocco's goalie was top notch!!!! Definitely man of the match!
Dope great job Morocco
مبروك لخاوتنا المغاربة. ان شاء الله تربحو الماتش الجاي وتكون الفرحة أكبر.
Congratulations Morocco!! Well done
Spain is a joke for what you need a possession if at the end you lose the game.
What a incredible performance from keeper BONO !!!!!!!
Morocco all the way to the final .
How...this world cup has been crazy
So who do you guys think will win the word cup!? Any thoughts!?
Incredible
Video of Battle of Annual, 1921 (colorized)
I am your ex president Barack Obama. Viva la raza. Congratulations to y'all Morocco son of a ....
The spirit of fight in the  Moroco team  lead them to a historic and inspired win..congrat Moroco and Africa
I bet the world cup winner Spain team now  can bet this Spain team lol
Good luck for Morocco 🇲🇦
Congratulations to you Moroccan brothers 🇲🇦. From Gabon🇬🇦, living in USA🇺🇸.  Africa ❤️ 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I like the part where they showed morroccos PKs
Let's goooooo
I think referee is not upto mark . He denied few chances to Spain . He called offside when it was not !!
Expected result !!! Looking on their group matches performance. Huge congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦
Expect the unexpected 😱
During the penalty kicks goalkeepers who wait and don't try to guess, win.
You’re telling me fox soccer’s production is so bad that they don’t even show all the penalties in a shoutout for the highlights.
Once again, Moors ravaging the Spainards, LOL.
Maybe one day Fox Soccer will figure out how to put together some decent highlights. Hopefully by the end of the tournament so we can see proper replays and and all of the penalty shots if it comes to that in the final. I don't know... Learn the game? Hire a Brit? Do something!
One of the biggest upsets this world cup, congratulations to the Morocco team !
Congrats Morocco from a Senegalese brother🇸🇳 in San Franscisco. Happy for you all.
MASHALLAH AND ALHAMDULILAH
Why not show all of the penalty kicks in highlights??
That chip for the win was wicked 😮
What a goalkeeper 😃
Just wow!
All the European analysts gave Morocco no chance at all. Spain is finish as Germany
👏🏼great game Morocco
Prince of 🇲🇦 should marry princess of Spain Leonora
Wow! I was cheering for Spain, but also happy for the Moroccan people. I always go with the underdog; and now that Korea & Japan were eliminated, looks like I’ll be supporting Morocco to win it all.
Wow, an unforgettable match. Morocco showed some true grit today
Los gachupines ya casi se sentían campeones cuando golearon a Costa Rica! Ahora a ver el resto de los juegos en TV! 😊 Felicidades a los Marroquís, primera gran sorpresa del Mundial!
Congrats Morocco. Did Espana throw this one? Or they just lack talent they once had?
Morocco deserved the win! Gg spain!!
You're guys make Africa proud.
Spain is and always was overrated...even when they won cup in 2010 it was impossible to watch their game. I hope Marocco sends home Portugal or Swiss.
so proud of my country!!
Bye bye Spain
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
That's a good game right there.
Congratulations 🇲🇦 🤝 🇪🇹 እንኳን ደስ አላችሁ  تهانينا
This is amazing. I couldn't watch the match while it was been played live but I'm watching the highlights on fox sports and I am super excited right now Morocco made it to the quarter finals.  God bless Morocco 🇲🇦 love from Nigerian 🇳🇬
This game shows the brilliant work of soccer strategy. The Moroccan coach turned soccer to football 🏈 game.
🇪🇸 team is the weakest of the weakest . Good job 🇲🇦
Idk who was worse, Japan or Spain
lul
Why is the highlight video is lowlight, where all the chances and why not all Penalties included ??!!!  Dislike for FOX Sports.
Morocco morocco morocco what have u done yes you making every body happy from africa to Asia from land to the see we are proud of you we wish you all the way brothers im from iran مرحبا
Yyyyyyyyyyyy fuera!!! 😂😂😂
SCOTT STERLING!!!!!
Glad Morocco won. Spain is the most boring team this year.
Muslim nations wildin out at the WC. As they should
Morocco is among the elite team to play the beautiful game among the best and they proved it, tell that to Landon and Ian who commented the game favoring Spain to win it,so much talk guys,just say the minimum of what is happening on the pitch and wait for the end of the game.The Moroccan team destroyed the team from Spain,way to go out out of the world cup 2022 in Qatar.
Send Spain Home!
Hakimi with ice in his veins 🥶
Morocco needs to sit that # 21 striker if they want to go far. He even worst than lukaku
Let’s go Maghreb!!
Congratulations to the Morocco team! The whole Africa should be proud of you
MOROCCO WILL BE CHAMPION OF THEN WORLD CUP
MashaAllah.  I'm so proud of this team. ❤️
Adios 🇪🇸 España😢
Well done 👏  Morocco 🇲🇦.  Sent them home..
As an Algerian I could not be any prouder today. Go Morocco, go Maghreb, go Africa.
The kings 👑 of Africa have arrived, no other sport could ever be THIS exciting without anyone scoring ! Morocco was a red impenetrable wall Spain couldn't climb this time👍 Penalty shootout two days in a row was real treat too !
Unbelievable finish, but why not show Morocco's other goals?
Bravo Morocco made history!!! History doesn’t repeat himself or rhyme.. where is my Finish Russian or norwegischen as long as they keep themselves associated with westernization!!!
The Muslims world The  Arabic nation The Africa nation ARE SUPER PROUD OF MOROCCO,LOVE FROM TUNISIA
Tão deixando a gente sonhar 🇧🇷
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦 what a game! That goalie deserves a raise🎉
Fantastic and congrats .
How come they didn't show the Morocco penalties except the last one
InshAllah Morocco 🇲🇦 will win the World Cup. Outstanding performance by first African country.
FRIQIIII ❤️
Audible gasp
Style of the Nile 😂 adiós Spain a la v
No starting lineup shown for Spain????
Yasin bono ♥️
My favorite game so far.  Morocco's defense was unbelievable. Yassine went full super human 🔥
I didn't agree with everyone else on how "great" Spain is but that does not take away how great Marocco played!
Unbelievable. Spain made us think they were good with that 7 0 win
Buenos Noche Espana
Hakimi is a savage 😂   Congratulations from the USA! You have our support!
WOOOOOOO GO MOROCCO, VIVA AL MAGREB
Great win for Morocco. This is how South Korea felt in 2002. Enjoy your win!
Ronaldo is about to make $200,000,00 a year and he is not even part of the penalty. Lmao. He’s overrated, old and a whiner. Yet Saudi’s Arabia will pay him $200 million a year. This will be the worst sports contract in the existence of sports. Period.
The Moroccan lion means business this time. The joke is over!
I loved being proven right. Spain is overrated and a win 7-1 over utter trash is nothing to be hype about.
Let’s goooo Spain out
This tournament just proves how important it can be to be confident in your penalty taking. GK was absolutely brilliant but a proper PK should be near unsavable, Bono was like superman today
100% Passion from Morocco and 110% effort. I knew they were going to try really hard, but I didn’t think they would win against Spain, big congrats to Morocco! 🇲🇦
LETSS GOOO MOROCCO!!!
Maroc 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
I honestly did not expect this from Morocco. I was going for Spain but sadly they lost. My respect for Morocco 🇲🇦 ❤ Great game
Morocco proved once again in World Cup, all you need is a world class goalie.
Good going Morocco. I hope Spain stops calling all those Barca players and use other teams players for their roster.
THANK YOU MOROCCO 😭  As a German fan, sehr gut!!  Congratulations truly to getting into the Quarter finals! ❤️ Make history, and go for Gold!!
The goal is to make USA win this cup and this is all I can tell you for the moment
Watch out Europe! Moors are coming back They conquered Spain now and next is Portugal in the quarterfinals.  Then next is France in the semifinals.  Then next is Netherland in the final.
Goalie did great. That was also the worst set of free kicks I've seen at a world cup from Spain.
مبروووووووووو ك  يا المغرب  مبروك يا اسود الاطلس  ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😘
Arabs pay to much money to referee  Shane on FIFA Shame
Rigged
4:03 They really said "living in his head rent free" 💀💀💀
The Moroccan goal keeper is the real MVP of this match.
Where is moroccos first two penalty ?
Bono might've flailed his hands like the inflatable man you see at a used car dealership but man can save when it matters 👐 He's a Moroccan hero after this one no matter what👍
Dima Maghrib ❤🦁
Hakimi 🥶
What’s the point of the < 5 min highlights? It’s really disappointing to not even see all of the penalty kicks, let alone build up from different points of the match. If you really needed to keep the length down, cut out the static shots of the crowd, mangers, players reactions etc. these only add value when more of the build up play is being shown. I hope you take these points into consideration
Congratulations 🎉 🇲🇦 🇮🇳
What a cold blooded, cool penalty by Hakimi to win it for Morocco. Such pressure, no nerves. The man is ice cold.
👍👍👍👍
Japan sitting at the airport* Japan: Hola where you going? Spain: Back home..... Japan: Penaltys? Spain: Yup Penaltys :(
The Moroccan goalie went brazyyyyyyyyy
Haha karma spain bye bye
Hakimi with the panenka is tuff
Why couldn't we see the whole shootout? Kinda sus that we only see the last kick and all Spain shots.
How come a lot of people are saying the World Cup is rigged
Morocco will go to the final and will be  exciting for Africa and Arabs!! Cheers from Ethiopia!!
Great performance from Morocco ranked 22 FIFA defeat Spain ranked 6 or 7 with a professional 'La Liga" It took a few elements to take win humility, courage, discipline...  Felicidades a todo el pueblo Marroqui.
It looks like this year Marocco were the dark horses
Yassine for the Yashin!
Congratulations 🎉 🇲🇦 From 🇩🇿 keep it up
I am Moroccan, all 4 of my parents are Spanish , 3 of my Dads have killed themselves because Spain are so boring. I am glad the world cup is only 4 weeks of soccer.
This how the United States should've played  Deep defending to counter attack Low press describes a defensive tactic in which a team sits back and allows the opposition to attack, with the aim of winning the ball and making a counter attack or try to win it on penalties
They will make biggest history this world cup
We about to see Moroccan Riots in Europe now, like they did in Brussels after they beat Belgium. Watch out Spain, especially in Madrid & Barcelona.
Spain seems to be getting stuck on Round of 16. Russia in 2018, now Morocco.
Once they went to penalties  Marocco won before it started.
Gavi and Pedro are going to go back to Barca absolutely hating Sergio Busquets 😂😭💀😂
Spain lost because they have too many Barca players. Barca players aren’t winners
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦 Well deserved👍 from Mauritania 🇲🇷
Mo
Went to a Moroccan restaurant in Disney world the other day. Looks like all of Morocco in magic Kingdom today. Congrats. What a win
Wow! That is amazing and awesome!
Good job Morocco you did it
Dear Fox,  Your world cup coverage has absolutely sucked. And now you can't even show the full penalty shootout??
Let's go Morocco,  win this for Morocco and all of Africa,  all of Africa is rooting for u guys
Congratulations Moroco for they played with a game plan and executed very well.
Morocco 🇲🇦 on the map for sure 🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸
Did Fox Sports just skipped 3/4 penalties for Morocco? Have some shame editor
Spain only have Morata to score their goals, that is their problem
Amazing game  Morroco has been playing. Awesome excellent 👏
This is one match that deserves extended highlights
Let all Africans support our light skin brothers 🤣 they are all we got . Congrats Morocco 🇲🇦
Go Morocco🇲🇦! I believe they can reach the Semifinals! I'll be cheering them on from the U.S. 🇺🇲!
Wow. Euro boys Out !!!!
Goalie for MVP 🎉
Great coverage and highlights by Fox
Congratulations Morocco 😍😍😍💯💫
Spain goalie diving too early in the penalties.
I think they are the first team to win on penalties going first
Show all the goals you pansies
why dont they show the whole penalty kicks?
Allahu Akbar Allah hu Akbarr….moroco subhanaAllah ❤️
thank you for the no spoilers on the thumb Nail!
Wow I did not see that coming. . Props to Morocco 🇲🇦
Bravo Africa ❤
Wow!!!!!
The Latin Americans must be happy. They knew all the bad things Spanish Conquistadors did to their land
Congrats, Morocco! You've made Africa and the Arab world proud!  مبروك  🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦
Go for Gold, Morocco!
Oh noooo, Spain is so bad at penalties. Spain let the game get to that point, and Morocco capitalized.
Morocco = Japan, but knows how to kick penalties
Big surprise
Me losing my bet because I thought Spain 🇪🇸 would win! Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦!! 🎉🎉🎉
Barcelona is officially out
Wasn't expecting Busquets to miss
A penenka for the win?!  Savage.  Well done Morocco!
That dance by Hakimi 🐧  😂
Allahu Akbar rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!! This was my world cup!!!! Bono had made nervous during the game, but came out as a champion in the history of Moroccan sports!! Alhamdulillah for the win!! My blood pressure was high, my heart rate 110, my voice is gone, but all worth it!! Morocco, so much love from your Afghani-American brother!! Asalama!!
Spain were getting flashbacks when Moroccans ruled Spain for 700 years. Go Morocco 🇲🇦
Those penalty kicks from Spain were worst than the ones from Japan. Congratulations to Morocco. This World Cup has been great.
Spain kind of lost in purpose, so an Arab country could because of qatar paying millions for these arranged world cup.
Spain choked just like the Japanese
It would be different if de gea was the gk
Amazing goalie play
Goles que no haces, Goles que te hacen.
Nobody could score against Morocco yet in this world cup , alhamdoullilah
Best story in the World Cup yet.
I wonder if Spain and Japan do penalty kicks shootout, who is going to win?
Well well.. this is the kind of upset we have all been looking for. Let's go Africa 👍🔥
We made it... As a Moroccan I would like to thank our neighbors Spain for the good job and great game. Good luck in  the near future, nothing happened, you guys have a great team and a great coach Inriqui. Big up and keep it up
Congratulations 🍾🎈 from Ghana 🇬🇭 to Morocco 🇲🇦!! Africa is proud of you!!
Imagine saying Spain was gonna win it all
Am I dreaming?!?!  That did not just happen!!!
Croatia 2018 = Morocco 2022
Congratulations magrib ale ale🇲🇦🇲🇦❤️❤️♥️💪
"oh, he's made a mess of it"   English commentators are savage.
I love when evil prevails. 🇲🇦
A couple of neighbors duking it out
Way to go Morocco, great game!  Tough beat for Spain.
Yeaaaaaaaahhhhh great win
There's no problem wrong with the core of Tiki Taka but in modern soccer where players' conditioning is at an all-time peak,  and physicality is imperative to team training, the base version of Tiki Taka wouldn't cut it anymore. All Spain and Barca have to do is encourage serious physique-building in their team's training time. Messi wouldn't have scored all those goals if he falls every single time an opponent bumped into him while possessing the ball or dribbling. Too many times a serious counter-attack that could've led to a goal is notified just from a small pull or hit. The other problem is not shooting enough precise shots.
I can't believe it! Fantastic!
I’m Moroccan and I congratulate both teams for the great game. Congratulations Morocco and best of luck Spain in the next WC🙏🏻
The world knows how to play soccer now.
🎉
Bring that title to Africa Atlas Lions 🇲🇦❤️
That Panenka at the end was everything
That spain coach sucks 😂😂
Amazing game!! Good job Morocco, well played.
woo hoo that Moroccan goalie!!!
How are you going to have a highlight video and only show one of the penalties scored? IMO each penalty should have been shown. Disappointing.
Spain was fraud lol
This is so sad
What did you expect when you take Europa League level talent
spain really thought they were playing it smart by placing 2nd place to avoid brazil😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2010 spain team would have cleared .
Very weak penalty kicks by all teams this World Cup!
Vive le Maroc 🇲🇦
Today I feel Moroccan
Not to take anything from the Moroccans but this one felt strange 🤔the way Spain players approached the shoot outs as they were not trying to win at all no effort whatsoever
morocco hit the griddi on spain
Spain as bad or worse than Japan at penalty kicks. You’d never advance like that. Morocco was the better team.
why wouldn't you show morocco penalty goals ?
I like it  ,
One of the best games of the World Cup so far.
Morocco vs Spain Highlights: Morocco stun Spain 3-0 on penalties to reach historic quarter-finals. https://youtu.be/P3BplakHbFE    Morocco vs Spain Highlights: Morocco stun Spain 3-0 on penalties to reach historic quarter-finals https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvSWQyoPGcXTXKIy--y0a5g?sub_confirmation=1
Congrats my beloved Moroccans from Palestine 🇵🇸 ❤
I made a prediction of the teams that will make the Quarter Finals. So far, Morocco is the only team not on my list. Congratulations to The Atlas Lions.
Spain was playing so well, but that goal keeper through away the game
Well played. They deserved to win.
This game was played for 120+ minutes and all you could show is 4:57 minutes of highlights? What a shame. NFL’s games are only 60 minutes long and y’all showed 13 minutes of highlights, but can only show 4 minutes of a game that lasted over 130 minutes. SMH
Why couldn't you just post all the penalties up?
Well done Morocco. Maybe now the Spanish will learn to never underestimate a team
Bono was a man possessed! How tf does he have a smile on his face while he's faking the Spanish shooters in arguably one of the biggest moments ever in his career? Haha
Keeper gave me goosebumps
Congratulations very much Morocco! You truly deserved to move forward!
Félicitations au Maroc pour cette belle victoire.
I was part of the national youth team in the early 90's in Maamoura and I can certainty tell you that this victory was long due! Congratulations to Morocco! 🇲🇦
Penalty kicks. Lol. Soccer is boring AND dumb.
Congrats to Morocco 🇲🇦 from Mexico 🇲🇽
Why does Wales get to send their own team?  The UK should be able to send 1 team but they can, in theory, send 4.  Biased.
Congrats Morocco 🇲🇦 from Poland 🇵🇱
Why not just show all the PK’s?
Most shocking result of this world cup.
Spains penalty misses were more important than the Morocco's goals. I didn't see them 🤷‍♂️
This win is for Morocco, this win is for Africa, this win is for Arab nations, this win is for anyone who ever struggled against the odds!!!!!!! This is phenomenal and truly a great honor to have people supporting us from all over the world as our team and our fans support and play for all of us and all of our history together ONE LOVE FROM A MOROCCAN <3 <3
Morocco was AMAZING! They lack a good striker in their team but God...their Defense is the best...and by far the best GK this WC has seen!
Congratulations Africa
❤❤❤ مراكش ! Wow 🤩  🇲🇦 المغربيه
Don't wear Adidas if you're going to PK.
Why are so many teams not taking the penalties serious. Its almost as if theyre doing it in purpose 🤔
Spain chocked
Spain is the most overrated team on the planet
يا المغرب.  نحن الإيرانيين نحبك.  أسود الأطلس 🇮🇷🥰🇲🇦
🇲🇦  made history and eliminated 🇪🇸 in penalty kicks , marocos goalkeeper it's pretty on the other hand Spain looked strong in round 1 but is knock out stage disappears but hey K O stage is another style of game....congrats 🇲🇦...good luck in the 3rd round..
Spain never impressed me in this World Cup, their style of lots of possession and excessive passes without any objectivity is very boring. They were like that even in 2010 when they won the World Cup barely scoring goals but they had more experienced players . Now this style wont work anymore, nobody is going to win the World Cup scoring only 8 goals in 7 games, not gonna happen!
Morocco peaked at this game had multitasking in class to see this game, quality from Spain though just couldn’t finish in regular time and pens 😂
Underdog wins
The Moroccan defense was incredibly impressive. If they keep playing like this they could go to the final. 🇺🇸❤️🇲🇦
Congratulations Morocco from the USA with love!!
Bonou No No No
Best world cup ever all the upsets and thrillers especially japan
who’s living in Spain without the S?
Congrats to my brothers Moroccans. You really deserved it. I'm so proud of you..... from senegal
What an incredible performance by Morocco top to bottom and especially from Bono what an incredible shoot out!!!!!
I guess we found out who the dark horse is
Good game both teams congratulations to Morocco from Bosnia from the bottom of my heart
Bye bye spain.. Morocco has a smart goalkeeper.
*Morroco exposed Spains lack of goal scoring and lack of penalty skills*
Good job morocco, for teaching the o thg her African countries how it's done. Switzerland or Portugal is no match for you. You are heading all the way to the finals to make Africa proud. Good luck guys.
Morocco eliminated one of the biggest candidates to win the world cup. Morocco will win the world cup for sure
Spain main forward asensio has been a benchwarmer at Madrid. Enrique supposed to ask anceloti to give him more minutes before World Cup.
Oh Morocco must be one very happy nation, well done.
Congratulations Morocco
Penalty kicks is the worst way to end a match. Change it to where they start at the mid-field line and they run up to the GK 1 vs 1. Japan and now Spain lost in PK. Pathetic sport
🤯
Morocco is an African country, how come there are not black players playing for Morocco? Morocco the strangest African country. Wakanda forever.
So happy and proud of 🇲🇦 Morocco  Congratulations on the win
That keeper is great
Why are they not bowing Morocco’s penalty kick goals?
A lot of these African countries are so good Tunisia🇹🇳 beat France🇫🇷  Cameroon🇨🇲 became the first African country to beat Brazil🇧🇷  Senegal🇸🇳 even beat Ecuador🇪🇨  And now Morocco beat both Belgium 🇧🇪 and Spain 🇪🇸
❤❤❤❤ morocco
YESSSSSAS F U spain HAHAHAHA BYE BYE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol oh spain you play the most boring football death to a thousand passes and still lost.
“Cinderella”
How much Spain missed David De Gea today in penalties.
Spain's strategy for avoiding Brazil succeeded beyond their wildest dreams! HAHAHAHA!!! Germany congratulates Morocco!
Morocco's defense was just impenetrable. They could definitely make it to the semi finals.
You could tell that Spain were mentally defeated as soon as they knew it was going to penalties.  Lost all motivation, whereas Morocco stayed focused and hyped up.    Failure on the coach and players for being mentally fragile.
Congrats Morocco.
You are kidding me!😮🎉🙌🏽
Wow!
Seeing this live was absolutely stunning to watch.  I felt so moved by their celebration at the end of the game even though I didn't pick favorites this game.  Congratulations to Morocco for an outstanding performance today, you deserve the best!
Lmao, I love this World Cup, so many games with a surprising outcome.
Absolutely electric, the 2026 cup is going to be bonkers as even more nations take note and inspiration from these breakout performances.
Tiki taka without pace and strikers is finished
Morocco I'm so proud of the Atlas Lions. We played with desire, grit, and a determination to win.
Wow just wow
Morocco proved them topping their group wasn’t by luck. This team’s performance is massive. All Africa are behind you Morocco 🇲🇦❤️
winter marie Haines Radford ILOVE YOU MUCH RIG ON BOX MARY YES 2327 HAPPY BRTHDAY DAY PUMPKIN
I called it at work and I'm glad Morocco silenced all of my co-workers. This is the world cup of upsets. Thank you Morocco for playing their hearts out and congratulations!
Congratulation team of Morocco first step accomplished.👏👏👏
Zyech got balls of steel
Who would think of this result prior to the game but Marocco deserved it. Congratulations to the Maroccan people.
History made right before our eyes! Well done Morocco!🎉
Love how the Moroccan coach went to celebrate with them. Congrats Morocco.
Arabs and Africa stand up 🙌🇲🇦❤️🇺🇸
Liverpool fan here, I love hakimi lol
Moroccans 🇲🇦 will be celebrating this famous victory for a long time! First QT-Finals appearance for Morocco at the WC. And to beat Spain is a bonus because of the difficult history between the two nations. Spanish players should've taken more shots ⚽️. Anything can happen when you aim for the target 🎯 . Too much possession and not enough goal scoring chances. Give all credit to MOROCCO 🇲🇦 👏 🙌 ⚽️.  Congratulations to Moroccans all over the world!🌎
Snooze fest
wow what a match. what a win
Well done Morocco, congrats.
Kudos Morocco. Spain… those penalties. You were passing it to the goalie. I felt Luis Enrique’s pain through the screen.
North Morocco lost 😂
Goalkeeper Bono, a giant 6'5'' born in Canada, plays in Sevilla and knows the style and technique of Spanish footballers taking penalties ideally. Big win! Congrats Marocco!
Spain...channeling the energy of recent Barcelona lol.  Overhyped, then crumbles when it matters.
This is why we are here all gathered watching the World cup Because it's unpredictable! 🔥
game of the tournament🇲🇦
I was suporting morraco from pakistan ❤️❤️❤️
Congrats morocco 🇲🇦 from USA 🇺🇸
That smile after the goalie caught the second penalty was EPIC… 😎
Got goosebumps from that performance 🎉 That goalkeeper is phenomenal!!
Congratulations to Morocco 🇲🇦 from Eritrea 🇪🇷! Proud of your achievement .
Fox isn’t very good at making highlight reels…
Morocco’s defense was on point this game. Big thanks to Soufian Amrabat and BONO 🎉🎉🎉
Spain was just Tiki Taka and no attack at all. It's impossibel these days to make it all the way inside the goal keepers area to be able to score as Spain has zero long range shooting.  Their players are way too young, as they were always outmuscled by the older Morocco guys. I hope Luis Enrique era in over and Spain can practice a more direct Football combined with skill.
Spain had no shots on target first half 😳
THE UNDERDOG OF THIS WORLD CUP. COGRATS MOROCCO!
Mashallah to Our all Muslim Brothers around the world!!
Morocco deserve to be in the quarterfinals: they have a talented team, a clear idea how they want to play, and the discipline to implement it.   I'm normally a Spain fan but can't say I'm too unhappy, after the selfish mess Spain made at the group stage.
I feel like Spain just gave It away.
Morocco for life❤❤ great game with unbelievable victory 🇲🇦🇲🇦
Go Morocco! 🇸🇴
Rooting for Morocco now!!
Congrats Morocco! Love from 🇲🇽
Where is Morata ? 🤣
How are you NOT going to show the Moracco penalty goals at the end of these highlights?! We want to see the GOALS SCORED!
Wow, Morocco 🇲🇦 what a game. Spain 🇪🇸 couldn’t handle the pressure
My dad’s been watching World Cups since the 70s and when he said Morocco was his dark horse team back in the round of 16 I thought he was crazy…looks like he saw something I didn’t!
The Morocco soccer team are dressed for Christmas
PURO PINCHE MOROCCO 🔥🔥🔥
Darn. What a match! So frustrating to see Morocco's forwards choking on a few 100% scoring occasions. But I was in awe at their defense. IMO they all by neutralized Spain.
Morocco, the gateway to Africa!
Spain’s coach thought busquets and Simón could carry them through the shootout?
France or England will have the easiest semi-final game ever. It is so clear this will be Brazil vs. England or France in the WC final.
Spain I was with you until you chocked, whyyyy, y’all deserve to lose at this point
I’m loving this World Cup
These PK takers from Spain and Japan need watch film from Sir Harry Kane’s penalty kicks.
spain deserves to lose with all those misses
Those penalties by the Spaniards were so telegraphed, I guessed 100%. Maybe the pressure got to them
Hakimi did not just do that😂 the audacity, the sauce🔥💀
Brazil needs to be knocked out next for acting like clowns last match.
Congratulations Morocco!!!🎉🔥 Hard luck Spain....great game!
Morocco 🇲🇦 will play the final vs Brazil 🇧🇷
His celebration when he scored that winning penalty was very clever hahahaha, congratulations!!
Good riddance to the possession merchants. Congratulations to Morocco 🇲🇦
It's not SPAIN we known
This is why I love football 😅
I feel so happy, thank you for representing Africa Morocco🇲🇦 💪💪💯🤝😊😊😊😊😍
Nice passes Spain lol
Yay As an Iranian I wish you luck...first north african country to make it to semi finals.
Sergio Ramos would never miss a penalty 😂
Morocco  made our continent proud. #Africa #salam
Why are you not showing Morocco goals😡😡😡
Now wouldn’t you guys show all the penalty kicks 🙄
What an incredible upset.
Not a soccer expert and don't have a solution by any means but shootouts seem like just rolling the dice (not any  reflection of what the sport is meant to measure by)
Morocco was absolutely amazing, they’ve made Africa very proud. Their fight and determination throughout the 120 minutes was exceptional.🙌🏾
Congrats to the best team in the world they really gave me goosebumps . I hope Morocco wins the World Cup
absolutely beautiful
post the ful shootout yall monopolize soccer vids then just give us 1 moroccan kick in the entire shootout
My first time to see Morocco play in this world cup. What a surprise how well and calm they played.
Coward Spain, they lost to Japan to avoid Brazil, now lost to Morocco, I will support Portugal or Swiss to defeat this lucky Morocco
they said we want second place so we meet Morocco.. Spain deserve to lose.
Why not show all the pk’s? This is almost as bad as the PGA Tour highlights. 😂
I'll take Morocco 🇲🇦 over Portugal 🇵🇹 or Switzerland 🇨🇭 at this point 👉 ! Great Story 👍
If the speculation of Spain losing on purpose to face an easier opponent is true, y'all just played yourself.
Wawww morocco super congrats
Goota love it! Oh my goodness!
Maybe even more passes without shooting would have got it done for Spain 😂
Que bueno por marruecos.felicidades.
The balls to do a peneka at the world cup is hugee
🇲🇦💪🏻🔥😂
Bro that American commentator does not know his stuff
Best defensive team in the world cup, only 1 goal allowed. Congrats Morocco.
the last penalty 🤑
Muchos morrillos sin experiencia en mundiales en España
Morocco will win the world cup 2022
Proud to be African 👏👏
Everyone tag Jaylen Waddle now 😂😂🔥🔥🔥
They both had great defense. But the goal keeper for Morocco was just incredible.
Mashallah! Alhamdulillyah!!!
NOw we know why group E is called the group of Death
Give us extended highlights
Morocco is winning it all.
Africa is Maghrebi tonight!
First African nation to make to quarter finals this year.  Huge congratulations to all African nations. Proud of you guys. Keep going
I like how this world cup has been so unpredictable lol. Good job Morocco 🇲🇦!! Celebrate 🎉
Respect and congratulations to my Moroccan brothers and sisters. Love, from Palestine. Your victory honors us all :)
Where’s Morocco first pen??
This was the best game of the world cup!
That Jaylen Waddle cele really was beautiful by Hakimi 😂
just shows that spain dont have a good finisher up front! and so doesnt morocco
Well done Morocco ❤️
Congrats MORROCO 🇲🇦🇲🇦WELL DONE …ALL AFRICA IS BEHIND YOU, CONTINUE MAKING HISTORY  BROTHER FROM SENEGAL 🇸🇳
Morocco is actually really good, they beat Blegium and Canada in their groups. They are better than Egypt and Cameroon by far. And I say this as an African, they are way ahead of other African teams , congrats to them.
Morocco is going to the finals  ❤
Amazing performance by Morocco! Congrats to Morocco from Perú!
I’m ready for something new. Do not underestimate the underdog teams. CONGRATULATIONS TO MOROCCO 🇲🇦!
Stupid spain should end the game before the penalty kicks. They deserve to lose it all hahaha
Spain deserved this for not trying to equalize against Japan. They wanted Morocco, and they sure got em.
Morocco Goopkeeper is something else brilliant ❤
I knew this was going to happen. AWESOME job well done Morocco !
Shoutout to the Moroccan Goalie cause that dude was on Gandalf's "none shall pass" mode
Congratulations 🎊 to fellow African. I hope we can bring the world cup to the motherland...
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦 from Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
DIMA MAROC🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Adios espania
Why didn’t you show all the penalties?? Is it because Morocco won?I just subscribed and I’m unsubscribing.
Why did we skip half the penalties?
Their grit ,will to fight ,gut to confront  ,determination to make history has bear fruit . They will keep surprising us . Morocco 🇲🇦
Morocco's courage and grit was phenomenal. Super proud for them!
Congrats Morocco from Croatia!  We saw how dangerous this team is in the first game.. I knew Spain was in for a tough game. Good luck going forward! Hopefully see the rematch with you in the finals :P (I understand how unrealistic it is, but one can hope :) )
VAMOS , VIVA MOROCCO
Congrats!!
good job Morocco holding on and exposing the flaws in tiqui-taca
Morocco will win the world cup.Mark my words
WAY TO GO MOROCCO 🇲🇦 👏 🙌 DIMA MAGHREB
Waddle dance lol
Get wreckd Spain
The keeper and the defense is amazing they just need a solid offense to make this team unstoppable
Very disappointed in Spain they couldn’t get the result against a clearly inferior side with less players who can play with the ball at their feet I think an overhaul of the Spanish team is going to be essential if we want any success this decade
Spain didn’t want to move on ig
Morocco got so lucky. Didn’t deserve that win
Morocco make history we proud of Africa. 🇪🇹🇲🇦
Fox, I know you want to keep these highlights at around 5 minutes, but if it goes to penalties can we at least see all the shots?  I don't think anybody is going to mind a 6 or 7 minute video.  Anyway, congrats to Morocco!
Why did they cut Morocco's goal 🤐
MashaAllah Morocco. May you guys go all the way to the final.
Congrats to Morocco. I support Spain and am outrageous on their penalty performance. They deserve to lose!
Luis Enrique told his team before the game, men I've have studied the game that we lost to Japan, and I've learned a lot from that defeat, and that was how to kick the penalties.
They will burn Brussels tonight.
Morocco got so lucky. Didn’t deserve that win
Someone's gotta let Luis Enrique know that the game is football where you gotta score to win and not monkey in the middle.
Yes we. We make it who's next
All of the sudden i want Portugal to lose🤔
Morocco can advance to semi finals !!!!! Good luck for your upcoming match.
Four Africans teams have reached quarterfinals at fifa world cup  1990 Cameroon 🇨🇲  2002 Senegal 🇸🇳  2010 ghana 🇬🇭 2022 Morocco 🇲🇦
L highlight show all pens
Spain, being a soccer giant of a nation, didn't play attacking soccer. They focused too much on possession.  Morocco defended absolutely brilliantly in this match up and also throughout this world-cup so far. Penalties are always a toss up/ 50 - 50 chance. Congratulations to Morocco for winning this mountainous match and best of luck for the rest of the world cup. Congrats!
Needed De Gea
Looks like the spaniards ancestors won, good 👍 for them
Wow what a great game! My team is out but I still enjoyed that game. Congrats to Morocco
BONO 😍❤️😍
Bounou played out of his mind this match!!!! Congrats to Morocco!!!!!!
Well done morocco  🇲🇦  congrats .thanks  for making us as immigrants  proud 👏  Pennsylvania was watching 👀
Spain simply went back to be the boring and mediocre team  it used to be 12 years ago.  Not surprised.
Why didn't we get to watch Morocco first three Penalty shots? Wth
What kind of highlights are these that don’t show Morocco’s made PKs
Let’s Go Morocco; they deserved to win especially when they were closing down Spain that well. They’re the last country left from a continent that hasn’t won the World Cup so I have full support for them 🇲🇦👏🏻
In 2018 fifa wc, they almost defeated spain if fifa did not give spain the controversial goal. Between, the worst spain team I have ever seen since 1998.
Lol Barcelona players can't score penalties
Spain could have had Ramos, Thiago, Aspas, Moreno, Canales, etc taking penalties but Enrique said nah lol 😂
I'm extremely happy Spain lost congratulations Morocco
Wow!
Why can’t y’all show Morocco’s pens too?
الف الحمد لله وحده لا شريك له
“SpAiN iS gOiNg To WiN tHe WoRlD cUp”. They said after beating Costa Rica 🤣
The PANENKA was DISRESPECTFUL 😅
Well deserved win for Morocco!
Go Morocco 🔥🔥🔥
The only hope for Africa right now
Bono, my shots are all dead 😂
🇲🇦 🇲🇦 🇲🇦
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦🙏🏼
They deserve it ❤
Jajajajajaja afuera españoles
What a wild result honestly. Did not expect this
What does Gavi even do 😂😂😂
Now I feel extra sorry for the Japan team

MEXICAN in Mexico and USA area SUPER DEPRESSS.. Beside their BELOVE MARKETING EL TRI sent to la CASA REAL EARLY, MEXICAN second Favorite TEAM the PRIMOS FROM Spain just got Beat by MOROCCO...and they SHUTDOWN POWERHOUSE SPAIN. and former world champs.. Morocco Beating Spain is like GUATEMALA BEATIN MEXICO.. AND morocco players are TALL AND STRONG and FAST..THEY dont eat  MARUCHA SOUP AND KOLA LOKA AND FRIHOLES like all MEXICANS.. MOROCCO DID what MEXICO GENERATIONS DREAM.. the MAGIC 5th game..
Another african team eliminated
Wow Morocco pulling upsets when we all thought those were over 😮 congratulations Morocco
So proud of this moroccan team!!! Hopefully they take it home. يمني واحب المغرب واهلها
Do they teach these guys how to take penalties anymore?
THATS WHAT HAPPENDS WHEN YOU GET A TEAM MOSTLY OF BARCA PLAYERS… THEY WILL ALWAYS CHOKE😂😂😂💀💀💀
wow love the passion from morocco fans! well deserved . love from korea! 🇰🇷❤️🇲🇦
Not sure why Luis Enrique picked players like Sarabia, Soler, and Busquets to take those penalties.  So, so happy for Morocco though!
Japan:  We are the worst at PKs Spain:  Hold my Sangria
Go Morocco 🇲🇦.  Best regards to you from Iraq 🇮🇶. 😘😘😘😘
Fox, you need to show the full penalties! What is this?!!
The Battle of the Strait of Gibraltar has been won by Morocco!
Spain shat the bed lol
Burkina Faso 🇧🇫 here . Proud of my 🇲🇦 brothers/sisters . Somebody gotta do it lol . I hope y’all be the first African team to make history, cheering for y’all . There’s Only one Africa  Traduire   Burkina Faso 🇧🇫 ici . Fier de mes 🇲🇦 frères/sœurs . Quelqu'un doit le faire lol. J'espère que vous serez la première équipe africaine à entrer dans l'histoire, à vous encourager. Il n'y a qu'une seule Afrique
How does Marocco know about the Waddle dance??
Why are we not show Morocco's PK's? They won the match, surely they deserve to have their MADE penalties in the highlights instead of Spain's missed Penalties?
Bono the real hero of the game !!!! Congratulations Africa!!!!!!
the first arab and african team to make it to the semi final.
Glad to finally see another country qualify to the quarter finals other than the same teams every word cup
Let’s be real. Spain wasn’t going to make it far with Asensio as their 9 lol
Morocco goalkeeper GANGSTA!!!
Morocco well deserved 🙌👏👏👏 You guys can do it! 🇲🇦
Victory for all Africa and Arab people.. What a moment 🇲🇦❤ Congratulations from Ethiopia 🇪🇹
what are these highlights how do you not show the morocco pens
Hakimi chose Morroco over Spain Lmaooo wise choice
Love from 🇱🇷, congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦!
I’m not Moroccan so for me it’s pretty boring the way they play. 🤷🏻‍♂
History was made today with Morocco 🇲🇦 🎉
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦 making history at fifa world cup 👏
Congratulations Morocco. Something new
Can someone please explain the Brazilian player mini chicken dance ?
All NATO countries will lose - Russian quote Brazil Argentina or Morocco for me
Wow
I mean, Morocco is a smart team. Their defense was good. But they were counting on it, to make it to penalties. They didn't want to risk a missed attack and Spain counter.
True Underdog!! You deserve it 🇲🇦 👏
friendly reminder that the best moroccan players, including the goalie Bono, could have played for spain, the netherlands, or even spain itself, but they CHOSE to play for their home country ❤
Morocco haven’t let an opponent score the whole World Cup… including penalties 🤯
Teams like Morocco playing to their strengths and getting the most out of their players, love to see it! This world cup has shown that Europeans really need to stop underestimating the rest of the world.
I should speed was right about morocco advancing 😂
frick spain
Colonialismo getting rinsed in this World Cup 🙏🏾
I don’t know which one is better Spain penalty or Japan penalty
Unbelievable 🎉🎉🎉
Wowoowowiwowoiwiwowowowowowoowowowow!!!!
Maybe now Spain can think about giving Morocco their land back 🤣
Morocco sucked and they just played to defend against the superior team. They only did 'better' on the penalty shooting. That's all.
Real Madrid sold Hakimi because they said he wasn't good enough lol
Unexpected results !!!!! Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦
No you didnt just do that on last penalty…wow
Congratulations  🎊 👏 💐 Morocco 🇲🇦  for the outstanding performance. You made Africa so proud. Your perseverance is second to none. Your goalkeeper  was excellent  on the day. I hope you 🏆 ✌️
Morocco!!!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 I am so thrilled that you’re advancing. Best of luck in the next round.  ❤ from Washington, DC ❤
Congratulations 🎉morocco
Morocco 🇲🇦 love
Japan choked on PK's.  Spain = hold my beers.
I TOLD Y’ALL SINCE 1850s MOROCCO 🇲🇦 WILL DEFEAT SPAIN 🇪🇸 NOBODY LISTENED TO ME.
Best defence of the last 3 world cups. One goal (an own goal) at that allowed.
Gotta love an underdog story. Shout out to them🙏🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We dumped Spain out of the World Cup to make history. Defence Defence and Defence. Well deserved Atlas Lions. Our strategy and game plan worked to perfection, we soaked up Spain's pressure, had our chances but we didn’t capitalise but we killed it in the penalty kicks. BIG shoutout to to all players and especially Yassin Bounou.
Goalkeeper increased his value by 150 Mil Euros after this match
Am so happy for Morocco they deserved it Spain was making fun of Costa Rica so am happy they lost.
Spain was so lucky to not losing the game in regulation time for real
Congratulations 🎉 Morocco 🇲🇦🇸🇴💪🔥🏆
This was the most on your toes match throughout this year’s World Cup!! Let’s go🇲🇦
Gk made those shoots look like nothing
Man had the confidence to pull the panennka in a world cup
commentators across all channels implied morocco wouldn’t stand a chance, as if they didn’t know morocco has not lost a game yet during this WC  well done, morocco!
Big win for Africa and the Arabs!
Spain has only won 1 out of 5 penalty shoot-outs in World Cups.
boufal embarrassed this defense.
Ha ha where are all those people that said Spain were going to win the World Cup now bunch off band wagon fans
Spain ball controlled the whole time with none or little threat!
Congratulations from Mexico 🇲🇽 👏
What a final penalty scored by Hakimi!!! Top notch
I’m happy for you Morocco!! You made me proud !!!
Well deserved Morocco. And good game Spain.
Underdogs took it 😎
*Congrats Morocco* 🇲🇦 *from Ethiopia* 🇪🇹                   *The pride of Africa*
The Moors are coming back and reclaiming Iberia. Portugal is next
Morocco's defense is unbreakable sheesh
😅😅😅❤❤❤❤
what kind of highlights video that doesn't show all penalty shoots?
🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉👍👍👍👌👌👌👌🥳🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩❤️
Spains 1019 passes and 77% possession didn’t save them. They’re much too passive with the talent they have.
I’m Ghanaian and I thought this team would be out in the group stage. Morocco have only conceded once and that was an own goal, Spain couldn’t even score in the penalties. Congrats 🇲🇦 from 🇺🇸.
Good job Morocco!! Making Africa proud again.
Last team from Africa congratulations 🎉 you deserve it
These highlights need to be atleast 10min long. Come on FOX
Let’s gooooooo
I saw this coming!! 🔥🔥🔥
✈️
This is what happens when you calculate and lose intentionally to avoid Brazil. Well, you avoided Brazil indeed. Congratulation to Morocco!
Will Morocco be the first African team to make the semifinals?
مبروك لمنتخب المغرب الشقيق انجاز تاريخي للعرب وافريقيا والله فرحت كأن مصر اللي كسبت 🇪🇬❤🇲🇦
I'm happy TIKI TAKA garbage football is gone!
Love seeing upsets like this💯💯💯
Defense for Morocco was insane 🔥
Morocco’s defense has been something else this World Cup! Wow
Team Spain were in Spain during penalties but the “S” was silent.
This World Cup is WILD!!
You can't kick pk's like that. Awful. Well done Morocco.
Literally how do you not score in a penalty shootout? (Not to take anything away from the Morocco GK)
If Morocco win the world cup,it will be the greatest upset in the history of professional sports.
Morocco!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As a non Muslim American , I was supporting a Arab Muslim African country. They were indeed the Lions! Very happy for them! Very very
Wow! What an upset!
Why does Spain never shoot the ball?
Morocco showed the world their true determination and belief 🇲🇦❤️
advanced like a boss 🇲🇦
The goalie is definitely the man of the match. Congrats to Morocco!
Congratulations Morocco 🇲🇦 from Ethiopia 🇪🇹
De Gea would have saved those penalty shots 🤣🤣🤣
👍👍👍
Morrocco upset, now its going to be Switzerland upseting Portugal.

What a game from both sides! This Moroccan team will go down in history 🇲🇦 🇲🇦🇲🇦
Woah

Thanks for coming spain
CAMON MOROCC CAMON MOROCC
Morocco is winning it all
Morocco's defense was top notch, a truly dangerous dark horse in this tournament!
I'm just trying to figure out how you have over 1000 passes in one game, but only one shot on target. Someone, make it make sense.
MOROCCO!! YALLAH!!
The Arab world supports Morocco!
Spain forever stuck in a build up phase
Both teams performed well but wow morocco is a lot stronger than I expected!  Can't wait to see how long they will survive this tournament. Love it!
go moroccoo❤
I'm so proud of Morocco, in fact the whole of Africa is saying congratulations. 👏 I knew Spain will not go far: their youngsters still need more years to blend. See you in 2026.
LMAO
Congrats Morocco 🇲🇦
Unbelievable🎉
Congratulations Morocco and specially Yacin Bono the keeper was great tonight! First Arabian Country and 4th African to the Quarter Final, well deserved, and why not First Arabian & African Country to the Semi than the Final. 🇲🇦🇩🇿🎉🔥💪
Morocco’s out here carrying Africa on their back 👏👏
Morocco is one of the few teams that advanced to the knockout stage without losing a game but the commentators kept implying that they were the weaker team and a Morocco win would be an upset. Spain had more possession but Morocco was solid defensively and they were definitely the better team.
MOROCCO!!!!
What. A. Tournament.
What an upset… congratulations to Morocco!! Making history!
Should’ve brought Thiago and Ramos , well played Morocco 💯
Sheesh
Good game
Hakimi got some balls on him
No views? How come?
1st to comment! What a surprise!!
Penalties from Spain and Japan were horrible this week, very good defensive and shots from Morocco 👍🏻
viva Morocco
Spa"in" will now be known as Spa"out"😂
I’m confident to say at this point. From what I have seen from the teams, France v Brazil final and Argentina v Portugal 3rd place match.
First?
