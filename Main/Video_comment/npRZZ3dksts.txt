Man i cant get enough of this song. Its a musical masterpiece! So cleverly written
this song was released 2yrs ago and I just realized- I JUST REALIZED!!! that MICHAEL CIMINO was here in JOSHUA BASSET'S MUSIC VIDEO. OMG, I played the music video MULTIPLE TIMES and I realized it just now.
Anyone here 2024? 😂
Omfg MICHAEL CIMINO
Hello🌹

I can tell this is gonna be his best album he is so talented
NGL the Ed Sheeran vibes are off the rails.
Who else is Jealous
This is my favorite song of all ... !!! So much feelings, deepth and wonderful text plus melody ... I love it.
Omg who here only saw his channel after they saw high school musical the musical the series
call me crazy, but I feel like season 3 of HSMTMTS inspired this song, like Rickys whole situation with gina, and josh was like, "this would make an awesome idea for a song"
ariana grande we cant be friends stole this one
Is he from high school musical the musical
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

This is so good❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this deserves a grammy
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SMOKE SLOW!!
"We're already here So one more won't hurt..."  Bruuuuuuhhhhhh!!!
HI COUSIN JOSHUA BASSETT 🥰🥰🥰😇😇
vampire!
I don't remember this episode of HSMTMTS
She asks for a light As our secrets spill on the window sill We're buying more time While we kill ourselves as we both inhale Making believe there's a future Is it naive to think we could work? The second it's out, then I lose her We're already here so one more won't hurt It won't hurt But all that we are is all that we'll ever be 'Cause he's the one waiting at home She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody There's only so far we can go Next to you but I'll never be close So take your time while you're mine And smoke slow Breaking away For the hell of it Started innocent I'm telling you things that I've never said Hope I don't regret this Making believe that we're clueless One little spark that we won't put out Makin' a million excuses 'Cause isn't it fun just for now? But all that we are is all that we'll ever be 'Cause he's the one waiting at home She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody There's only so far we can go Next to you but I'll never be close So take your time while you're mine And smoke slow Addicted to illusions of a love that never was And never will be anyway And nicotine don't taste the same If I'm not with you savoring every breath we take Play with fire, take me higher All that we are is all that we'll ever be 'Cause he's the one waiting at home She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody There's only so far we can go Next to you but I'll never be close So take your time while you're mine And smoke slow
Lyrical genius 👏🏼
is this soung from any series?
Anyone knows the lyrics he is singing on the tour? I went to his concert and during smoke slow he added some lyrics to the song and it sounded so good but I couldn’t really understand what he was saying and also I can’t find it anywhere 😭
This man makes me weak to my knees and I don't know why. Although we are basically the same age, I'm a 6.4 man.... Still, when I see his clean face, or hear his angelic voice I feel weak 😩
Not everyone hates there exs like this song could literally be about oliva 💀
I have boyfriend. But I am in love with my girl bestfriend and she has same feelings for me too. I will never fall into relationship with her becoz I am afriad we could never be bestfriends again. I am so tired 😔😔
masterpiece
Ummm Joshua I think you should ask Matt Cornett's advice about this smoking problem and don't you think it’s about vaping is bad and that causes Lungs 🫁 and Heart ❤and bad breath and problems and that pure pressure in smoking is not healthy and that needs to stop 🛑 ✋ and you have to cut back that nasty 🤢 🤮 😷 habits and do you want Matt Cornett to take you to Hospital about this pure pressure smoking and vaping and I don’t want you to end up Just Like I did when I was A Bitty Little Tiny kid that cause my medical mental health problem in 5 years ago and I don't want my best friend Joshua Bassett to feel in the same way
Bro I'm just finding out joshua is my. I thought this guy was 17 or 18....
I love joshua basset 💗💗💗
💗💗💗💗💗
Idk this song is so relating to me :)
feeling bad for the one waiting at home..
Smoke slow has become a new personal fav love you Joshua Basset🫶🏽🫶🏽
This song is so addctive and I can't stop to listenning it
0:43
… I think I just fell in love with the melody damn.
,"(
Love the fact that this song isn't abt smoking
Song starts at 0:43
Smoke Slow me like the title it sounds cool bro and the song is incredible too
What an amazing song !!! <33333
MICHAEL CIMINIO !!!!!! Omggg no way and Joshua!!!
Surprised darling isn’t in the lyrics but wowww so gooddd
Is Magic!
Oh wow, I loved that song
This is honestly my favourite of yours
poor victor
We love slow 🙏🏼😍🙌🏼🥰❤️🫶🏼
Thank you Joshua and the music and MV teams. This song's melody is so addictive and the bridge part is so amazing. The MV's montage cuts are exactly on the drum's beats, perfectly telling this sad but intriguing story.   ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
If you smoke cigarettes or cannabis cigars, if you own eligible lungs, hold the lighter underneath the cigar without the flame touching the end of what you smoke. 21% better experience. I punished myself once by smokin 150 unfiltered cigarettes. After smoking 7 in a row I had one horrible vomiting session. Not crazy
joshua comedor de casadas
Michael dont worry, I love you❤😂
i love the warning in the begining
After smoking 35,000 plus cigarettes, enough to stop traffic, I appreciate this song. Perfect
Mv kinda shady not gon lie
Damn it, I feel like I'm 'immersed' in his every song.
Voice of an 😇
Hold on a sec MICHAEL CIMINO???
❤❤❤❤❤❤ me encanta
CINEMATOGRAPHY KINGGG
this song is so perfect 🤍
The' HHHhhhiiiiiiiiggghhhheeerrrrrr' note got me higher, like seriously 🦋🦋🦋♥️
This video is literally sooo sad! But Josh is the sweetest...
that was amazing omg
Epping p
This song is so beautiful and it's always stuck in my head
This is like the coolest song I've hard you compose after high school musical musical👌
Just realized you can hear a heartbeat in the begining?
i can't believe Joshua directed the videos for smoke slow, sad songs in a hotel room and doppelgänger. Both the songs and the videos are incredible! Joshua is a genius and deserves much more recognition!

💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
a person: how many times have you heard the bridge?  me: yes
I am so in love with this song, so beautiful
Good 4 u lyrics : Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? (World?) And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (girl)  Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy Not me, if you ever cared to ask Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby God, I wish that I could do that I've lost my mind, I've spent the night crying on the floor of my bathroom But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it But I guess good for you  Well, good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want (ah) You bought a new car and your career's really taking off (ah) It's like we never even happened Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ha) And good for you, it's like you never even met me Remember when you swore to God I was the only person who ever got you? Well, screw that and screw you You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do  Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy Not me, if you ever cared to ask Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby God, I wish that I could do that I've lost my mind, I've spent the night crying on the floor of my bathroom But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it But I guess good for you  Ah-ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah-ah  Maybe I'm too emotional But your apathy is like a wound in salt Maybe I'm too emotional Or maybe you never cared at all Maybe I'm too emotional Your apathy is like a wound in salt Maybe I'm too emotional Or maybe you never cared at all  Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy Not me, if you ever cared to ask Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby Like a damn sociopath! I've lost my mind, I've spent the night crying on the floor of my bathroom But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it But I guess good for you  Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
can we talk about how pretty this girl is especially her being black it’s nice to see us not being sexualized (not saying all the time but in general)
Better then Olivia Rodrigo lmao
bro, amé
Joshua oozes appeal.  Great find!

Hi sophia
Omg …. Now I need a cigarette 🚬…….. 😂 , thanks for the disclaimer
Has anyone ever told you that God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life? Do you know beyond a shadow of doubt, if you were to die this second, if you would go to heaven? The Holy Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. The Bible also says that WHOSOEVER shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. YOU are a whosoever. You can know right now! Say this with your mouth and heart out loud! “Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart. Forgive me of my sin. Wash me and cleanse me. Set me free. Jesus thank you, thank you died for me. I believe, you have risen from the dead and that you are coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit, give me a passion for the lost, a hunger for the things of God, and a Holy boldness to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I’m saved. I’m born again. I’m forgiven and I’m on my way to heaven because I have Jesus in my heart. Amen.”   Please like or comment if you said the prayer out loud!   I want you to know all your sins are forgiven and you are on your way to heaven. Keep running to God and not away because He loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.
nicotine is not the problem tobacco smoking is
I WISH I WROTE THIS SONG PLZ ITS GENIUS 😩🙏🏼
My favourite of his songs so far
nice song
Rina's song (minus the smoking part lol)
I'm addicted
I love this song,it’s so good and catchy. Joshua Bassett is such a phenomenal singer and I wish his songs would be on the radio like Olivia’s . I feel like he’s underrated and not a lot of people know about him but he should get more attention.
Like him.
Smbsmsnsamam
day 28: i'm still here
okay cheater pop off
ñ
I wish he was as popular as Olivia.
"Next to you but I will never be close"

what i like about Joshua's song's is that i can identify myself, thank u for this masterpiece Joshua.
"Addicted to illusions of a love that never was and never will be anyway" i can't get over that line
DADDY
Only a select few songs truly understand my love life
this is so good wow
HOW DARE YOU MAKE ME FEEL -_- GOT ME OVER HERE HURTING IN A WAY I DON'T HAVE TIME FO XD
That woman got 2 stunning men falling for her
Cute
Beautiful lyrics 💖
I have this sing on loop ❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺
The fact that he and Sabrina now both have songs with thr word Smoke in them ❤️
hsmtmts x love, victor
does anyone get old disney love song vibes from the melody/instrumental of this song? It really reminds me of some of the love songs demi lovato released in her first two albums with disney
Can't wait for the debut album ❗❗
Hi Joshua I was wondering if maybe you can sing a song I wrote because you are a huge inspiration to me and it would mean so much, If it's a yes i don't do or have social media so maybe i can send you the lyrics through here
As a Kpop fan this video triggered having to wait 4 hours in line in the heat just 2 get great floor spots up front. The struggle is real.   But after being 4 feet from GD & BTS@ Kcon 2014 in L.A.  I can say it was worth the wait!
it’s victor!!!!!!!
Joshua's voice is so unique. Nice song Joshua, keep it up.
To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion. may peace and calmness fill your life.❤Please Click My Name If You Need More Of This❤
Great new video and song I know I am a couple of weeks late
instead of speculating who the songs are abt... let's make fun parallels and links. This could be what the other guy from secret feels like
Honestly such a good song, lyrically amazing too 🔥🤌🏻
That bridge deserves a grammy by itself
The bridge is the most played part
BEAUTIFUL!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
What a beautiful song indeed
His songs save this vibe... and so much feeling.
I really liked your song in high school musical the musical the series season 3
He needs Olivia to write him some hits
This song makes me want to walk along the beach at night listening to this or go on a late night drive with the windows down singing my heart out
Next to u but i'll never be close
love this song so much!!!!!
i LOVE the song, but IS THAT MICHAEL CIMINO?! I love him!!!
Masterpiece! I'm obcessed with the bridge
suprised this was referencing nicotine, maybe he should try weed lmao
I JUST DISCOVERED THAT MICKEY MURPHY DIRECTED THIS AND I AM SO PROUD AND HAPPY
His best song
i ewally like the bridge. Why is it so underrated tho???
VICTOR IS THAT YOU ?!
I give  it a 10 of 0
This song is so calming 😌 it’s definitely his voice 🥺😍
I can’t believe how small he is! Definitely soon to be famous
Cada canción nueva que lanza supera la anterior.
one of my fv songs, I've lots but this is my fv song of him, cuz I've fv songs of MJ, Olivia R. and him, u're so prett,y Josh, I'll always support u
Great!
Every song you make is always right on time with my feelings in the moment! 😭❤️❤️Always a masterpiece
I feel so bad for her boyfriend, if she's gonna leave him alone for hours at a party to be in bed with another guy then she might as well dump him. I'm surprised he didn't even show any negative emotions when she left the party with him, I'd be crying my eyes out if I was in his place xD But anyways, love the song so much!!!
Joshua is so cool love the song
💚💚💚
💚💚💚
🧡🧡🧡🧡
❤❤❤❤❤
Wow love this song
MY BABY
Im here on 22 August 2022

I love this man so much ❤️‍🔥 his voice, his music, his acting. He’s so talented.  A guy I wish to meet someday.
"Addicted to illusions of love, that never was, there never will be anyway". I love this song!

Aaah it has grown on me in those couple of days the chorus and the bridge gives mee chills
I love you 💕
He’s so cute and the girl is gorgeous. I’m obsessed with this music video!!
My new favourite song ugh it’s so good, the lyrics, his voice, the melody *chef’s kiss
Arrrgh so sad I missed this! I was at camp and they took away my phone😭😭😭
love your voice❤‍🩹❤‍🩹
They didn't even get a chance to date💔😭 but ahhhh they're so cute
im actually sad that eight days later this video hasn't even hit 1 Million views  I dont know when he will recieve his recongnition for his music but i hope its soon
Yeah he is a awesome singer
I LOVE IT!!!
💆🎶🎶
this song makes we want to cry
this is honestly my favourite part of the week :)
no por fabor
Can’t stop listening to this. Josh keeps getting better!
The song is good because it is about feelings and having a moment of time your voice is beautiful and your songs make people feel good so Thanks for making people feel good
is joshua bi
We don't deserve you joshhhh, your highers....
How does this song only have around 700 thousand views. This song is so good and I’m feel josh should deserve more respect
We love you Josh
im not trying to throw hate or anything by all means i love his voice and music, but i have to keep asking myself if he doesnt believe in smoking then why would he even show it for "entertainment"????
amazing!!!!
I don’t like his music much but this is the best one yet besides lie lie lie
I love the song, the bridge is really good! I hope that the album is coming soon!
Now everyone is hurting Driver's License-Olivia Rodrigo Because i liked a boy-Sabrina Capenter  Now here go, smoke slow
Thank you Joshua Bassett for breaking Sabrina Carpenter's heart😾💔😭, we don't need you.
If you have a chance, I would like you to come to Japan.
Is Michael featuring this video a missed oportunity of getting him playing Josh's love interest? 😂
God I love this kid and his voice and his songs and his talent since the day I watched him on HSMTMTS😭He deserves more love and recognition!!
So josh doesn’t smoke?
"'Cause all that we are is all that we'll ever be." I felt that. Perfect job on another song, Joshy!!!!!!!!!!!!
He’s so underrated, he deserves better
ILY JOSHIE BOO OWAWOAOWAWA
He's beautiful
I just cried OMGGGG 🤯😭
😧🥺😘
Ilove you SO MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH está canción 😍😍😍❤🔥
i love it… I genuinely do
The disclaimer alone enough for me to want to thumbs down
Josh never ceases to amaze me with his voice😭
“Don’t smoke, don’t chew, don’t go with boys(or girls) who do” Some book or smt I once read idek
I honestly luv all Joshua’s songs  this is not the exception
bestie joshua i love u sm and i really hope u will consider having a plus sized love interest in one of ur videos in the future !!! i'm sure it would make all ur plus sized fans like me feel so included and seen and it would just be great to have someone plus sized as a love interest bc u hardly ever see that in media :D <3
Micheal Cimino is here from Love,Victor
I love you, darling💘
This was gorgeous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6gGQnEWcdw
if u have good taste of music, listen Ross Lynch new songs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6gGQnEWcdw
His artistry is quite humble but it'll blow you the freaking away when you get to appreciate it
I hope he will release Say The Word and i would love a music video for it too
This song and mv isn't getting enough attention for some reason. This song is better than doppelgänger imo it deserves a lot more views
The meaning of this song is sad and wanting hope ✨
I love this song so much it's easily josh's best song
Absolutely beautiful! ❤️🎤🎧
I feel bad for Michael's character, poor guy
I LOVE THIS
what, did i just saw michael cimino?
The music video is legit a whole movie
I just love your autumn songs 💗
the melody in this chorus has been on repeat in my brain
I loved it but my little gay heart kept hoping he and love victor would kiss
The most amazing song by Joshua bassett who agrees
ok this song makes me feel single
holy cow
lindo meu namorado
Acompanho Joshua há apenas 3 anos e me sinto tão próxima, admiro-te muito. 🤍 Tudo que ele faz é bom demais!
It is awesome and amazing. I can relate Joshua Bassett. Very much. 💕 What you do.
Mikey is just the best! I remember watching his other projects in the past and well they’re all beautiful! I’m so glad to see him and josh direct together on this project!
everything about this is so poetic, from the smoking analogy used in the song to the warm lighting and the blue lighting.
What a wonderful voice you have !!! It makes so happy and cozy 😁
https://youtu.be/U6gGQnEWcdw
Best song for ages- fresh, catchy, direct, funky and always sentimental;) love you mate
why is this so good??? it sounds like that y2k disney movie type thing. its fkn great!!
this is why I love Josh. No other artist would have even thought of putting that disclaimer since smoking is so mainstream. love him
I'm officially addicted. Nice feeling. Od dawna tak się nie czułam. Jakby odbić się od dna. Hugs from Poland.
this song is beautiful
3 little words I love this  It's so subtle tells a beautiful story...🤍
❤️

He is incredibly talented and I love his music so much! It is so relatable and so good! He has a serious talent and career it is incredible i hope he never stops singing!
That's 🔥
but all that we are is all that we'll ever be
Olivia better
His songwriting gets better everytime he releases something new.. I also like the way he says pluck, it sounds like he's saying something else 😆
joshuas mind is actually crazy genius omg
I think this is my fav song ATM
Isn't he from the summer I turned pretty?
Looking for a full time companion to appreciate josh's vocals.
you never dissapoint, Josh! i love this xx
The disclaimer at the beginning. This is the kind of role model people deserve.
2:44 que es eso ajajajjaa
I would love to sing a song with Joshua that’s like on my bucket list
michael cimino!!
I’m in love with this video
VICTOR?!!!
Decir que es lindo es poco es precioso
Thank you.
All tears aside, this song is absolutely beautiful. I don't think I've listened to something this perfect in a while.
Why is this underated
Smoke slow (metaphorically tho because smoking is bad)
genius
So beautiful why was I surprised like duh he's a genius

Amazing
Loved every second of this
0:42

0:40
This hits?? Nah IT SLAPSSS
Genuinely just a good song.
DID I JUST SEE MICHAEL???
P E R F E I T O
OMG this song is very underwhelming
I have heard this song on repeat for like 100 times😭💜
oooh it's Michael Cimino
Joshua te amo
the tone is immaculate
This song deserves more recognition, the lesson is actually perfect, the meaning behind the lyrics and the symbolism of this mv is  fantastic. His story is relatable mostly to teenagers who fell inlove but didn't last...This masterpiece deserves more!
OH MY GAWD ITS JOSHUA BASSET!!!
That was amazing
Wow he smokes🤭
It was already a very clever and beautiful sentiment but THE BRIDGE?!?! The bridge  took it up so many levels for me. And the shots for it were gorgeous. Bold claim but this has to be my favorite piece of work from Joshua
No matter how many times i hear Josh I ask: HOW ARE U ABLE TO HIT THOSE NOTES NOTES BROOO ITS SOO GOOD I CANT 😭
Joshua Basset>>>>
This men has so much talent he deserves the world
AAAAAA JOSHHH I LOVE THIS SONG
I love this song it seems different to the rest of your songs but in a good way 😩
🔥🔥👍🏿
Don't put your trust in men, put your trust in God. Jesus is coming soon and it's time to repent. We are all sinners in need of a Savior. No one is perfect. We cannot earn salvation. It is a free gift from God. Mary doesn't save you, confessing to a priest doesn't save you, religion doesn't save you, self-help doesn't save you, meditating doesn't save you, Buddha doesn't save you. Only faith in Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection saves you. The Father gave His only begotten Son to die for our sins, and whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life. Cry out to Him now. He loves you so much, but He won't force Himself on you. True love allows freedom to choose. If you don't want Him, He'll give you what you want - eternity without Him in hell. If you genuinely admit you're a sinner and need His sacrifice to pay for your sins, He will cover your debt and give you life forever with Him in heaven. I hope and pray you choose life!!  This is realer than you could ever imagine.
This song make me feel so peace. I love this song. Thanks Joshua Basset.
I love this man
:)

K can we just take a moment how she looks extatly like chandelier Kenny likeee  there freaking dating and also in doppelgänger the girl looked exatatly like Olivia Rodrigo likkkeeeeee😳😳
Just for start I don't smoke and it's bad addiction but everyone does what they want, I don't judge. I like how he show a "bad thing being a good thing" like the best part of smoking was because we was smoking with the person he loves not because of the cigar or the addiction, just to be with the one he loves and theres the title "smoke slow" so that the moment could last longer and theres so good poetry in there as the the bad thing giving something "good"
Michael Cimino and Joshua together in a music videos I LOVED
listening on repeat 😝
the lyrics...the melody...perfect ❤️
👃🏻✡️

Let’s be honest this man is a flipping genius and a master of his craft
The ending chords of this song were amazing. The whole song was but that ending dang. His voice is also so amazing the notes he hits in each song and what he writes just wow
Omg, Michael and him in a video, when I first saw Love Victor, Michael's way of acting reminded me so much of Joshua's and now they're together in a video soo fun

Iloveyousomuch💘
💘💘💘
Joshua Bassett inspired me to go all in with my music because he was once just like me, an artist without many listeners. And now he's on top. I believe it will happen for me one day, I’m not stopping when it does!
my first response to this video was that i’d pay money to have him put his jacket on my shoulders🫡💗
king
I know some dont want to hear this but it needs to be said..For the rapper, drug dealer, prostitute, homosexual, partier, fornicator, drinker, drug user..Jesus is willing to accept you just the way you are.. Jesus died for all those and every sin and all a person has to do is believe he died or all your sins (past present and future) and you are justified in the eyes of God and will have a relationship with him forever
why is the disclaimer sending me akjdsubduweiad. seriously, dont smoke yall

Dejen en paz a mi hermanito Bassett
Déjenlo en paz
A REAL MASTERPIECE.
T amo
Usally I don’t like new songs right away but his voice is so amazing it’s hard not to love every song
1000 comment 👑👑👑
Proud to say I’ve been here since November 2019, so proud of you josh! <3
cause all that we are is all that we'll ever be when he's the one waiting at home.
This is so stupid that Josh would write / put out a song that contains references to nicotine and smoking if he does not do it. The worst thing is that he probably didn't write this song, therefore his label made him do this song even when he's against smoking, which might be why Josh wanted a warning at the beginning at the start of the video?
a.ma.zing.
“Next to you, but I’ll never be close”❤️‍🩹
We need the album
Bestie when are you going to drop the album
Not the disclaimer 💀💀💀💀
Hello Victor
JOSH YOU NEVER DISAPPOINT
I’m not good at interpreting songs so can someone explain to me what this amazing song means? Thanks 🙏🏼 ❤️
Amazing!
he gives me musty vibes
Joshua's talent is something else man, deserves all the love & support ❤
I’m living 😭🤍
His voice makes me feel like touching the sky!!!
JOSH THIS IS SO GOOD AHHHH
phenomenal
A little disappointed that he didn’t leave with Michael at the end but otherwise it was a really great song ☺️
this is amazing
This song is so good I love it remind me of 2000s music I would hear on the radio
Was my first time ever hearing the song, so good. I genuinely thought the third piece story was a masterpiece but now come on, he just keeps on getting better 🥺❤️
Joshua I can't explain how amazing and important you are to us. Can we talk about how genuine, talented, vulnerable, humble, HANDSOME, kind you are?Keep going and don't ever listen to any comment that can damage your big and strongly perfect heart. You have us, you have me, you have your family, your friends and I ams sure, this amazing song as well as your next ones will be breaking records. I genuinely care about you and love you so much from the deep of my heart. You've helped millions of should by just transmitting your super good energy with your guitar and lovely sweet voice. KEEP MOVING FOWARD AND NEVER STOP BEING THE WAY YOU ARE: SOMETHING BIGGER IS COMING.
Why is nobody talking about Michael Cimino in this video (love victor) 😭
flaco yo por ti, hago lo que sea
This is such a beautiful song about raw unrequited love...it hits and I love it </3
Cool
2:40 THE BRIDGE IS THE BEST PART OH MY GOD
I love his sound and his voice!!
sos el mejor
Definitely a good song. Love the bridge! I have to say though, I’m a little surprised that  Disney is cool with him creating something that references smoking, since they have such a reputation for keeping the actors in their productions on a “tight leash.” I guess this just shows that they’ve loosened up in recent years, allowing artists (especially their adult talent) to express themselves authentically. Just a good thing to see <3
W song
I love this song, the message, the lyrics, the vocals, everything is so perfect. Thanks for another masterpiece, Josh ♥
U REALLY ALWAYS KILLED IT! IM TOTALLY AND FOUNDLY PROUD OF U!!!! U LITERALLY DESERVE ALL THE FAME UR GETTING. LY!!
AMO QUANDO TEM MUSICA NOVA, PROMETE E ENTREGA TUDO
NÃO CANSO DESSA VOZ
TE AMO GENIO AAAAAAAH
Saw him on a pic with Halle so I decided to look him up.  Issa bop!
LOL not the “quit nicotine” ad right after the song ends😭
get with olivia rodrigo
OMFGGGGG WHY DO YOU DO THIS JOSHUA JUST PLAYS AT OUR HEART STRINGS 😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤🎶🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵GEEZ
VICTORRR??! 😫
I love every song Joshua Bassett puts out. This one is not an exception. What a talent
amazing well done you such a good singer
Smoking cigarettes is exactly what he's endorsing here.    That is the reason why it's in the video,  because it portrays it as if it was "cool", or "mature" or "bad boy-ish".   It's ends up portraying Joshua and the girl as weak, insecure and stupid children.
I’m not one to comment , but when i saw that it was directed my Michael Murphy (one of my favorite ppl on YouTube ) and Joshua basset I was compelled to comment lol. The message of the video was the first thing that I focused on when I first watched it. Trying to discern the story through the Imagery. Loved it very much !! Great job to both of them !!
OBSESSED
Joshua this song is so beautiful and Joshua keep making the beautiful and incredible music I love you Joshua bassett❤❤❤❤🎵🎶
I LOVE THIS SM JOSH
This just proves once again that Joshua Bassett is THE IT BOY😌
I really love the bridge it sounds amazing !

Sooooo beautiful and good !!! Thanks Joshua for the song!! Lots of love!
I LOVE YOU JOSHUA!! COME TO ARGENTINA PLEASEEEE
I can hear the end of “smoke slow” verse 1 lead into the chorus of his other song “Anyone Else”:   “We're buyin' more time While we kill ourselves as we both inhale…  How am I supposed to think about anything else? How am I to go on keeping this to myself? I am done pretending I want anyone else Anyone else”  Pretty great melody and lyrics regardless of if that was intentional or not!
AHHH MIKEY MURPHY DIRECTED THIS!? ILOVE

I LOVE YOU JOSHUA
🌻🎈
😭😭😍😍 Soooo good!!
I love you so much
I know, but— hahaha I love you so much  [Verse 1] She asks for a light As our secrets spill on the window sill We're buyin' more time While we kill ourselves as we both inhale  [Pre-Chorus] Making believe there's a future Is it naive to think we could work? The second it's out, then I lose her We're already here, so one more won't hurt It won't hurt   [Chorus] But all that we are is all that we'll ever be 'Cause he's the one waitin' at home She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody There's only so far we can go Next to you, but I'll never be close So, take your time while you're mine and smoke slow  [Verse 2] Breakin' away For the hell of it, started innocent I'm tellin' you things that I've never said Hope I don't regret this  [Pre-Chorus] Making believe that we're clueless One little spark that we won't put out Makin' a million excuses 'Cause isn't it fun just for now?  [Chorus] But all that we are is all that we'll ever be 'Cause he's the one waitin' at home She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody There's only so far we can go Next to you, but I'll never be close So, take your time while you're mine and smoke slow [Bridge] Addicted to illusions of a love that never was And never will be, anyway (Ah), ooh And nicotine don't taste the same If I'm not with you savourin' every breath we take Play with fire, take me higher  [Chorus] All that we are is all that we'll ever be 'Cause he's the one waitin' at home She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody There's only so far we can go Next to you, but I'll never be close So, take your time while you're mine and smoke slow
beautiful song ❤️❤️

I love it !!!!!!!
Que gran canción, esperemos tenga el éxito que mereces
I've waiting for this since the Tiktok demo! Joshy deverves all the praise and loveeeeeee!!!
The warning in the beginning 😭
Beautiful 🥹
Did nobody notice Michael Cimino in the background of the video?
Before i played this song and based on the thumbnail, i thought it was a song by him in HSMTMTS
Ily Joshua. I relate with this 🥲😭
👏👏👏 ✨iconic✨
this deserves a billion views. the lyrics are beautiful! congrats to joshua on another perfect song <3
He’s such a talented song writer/story teller.
the greatness !!! tis song is pure soul !!
My god I love this beautiful song so much I love love love this.. especially 'but all that we are is all that we'll ever be' and 'she holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody' part is so touching
I've only recently became Joshua's fan cause I just started watching hsmtmts and I'm obsessed with his music. He even inspired me to start writing songs again. Every single one of his songs are amazing so as this one. I'm just blown away by his talent.
This song is perfect! They lyrics, the melody, the video, the vibe! ❤️ we’re all so proud of you josh!!!  You never disappoint, your music just gets better and better!! Can’t wait for the rest of the album!! ❤️❤️ -loveliest people in the world ❤️
LITERALLY OBSESSED!!!
100% my favourite music video yet <3
aaaaaah this is really good. proud of u
disclaimer caught me off guard but it really shows that he cares about his morals more than a little bit of attention
My jaw dropped and the chills came on strong at 2:39
❤
Love the videoooooo!!!
Joshua and Michael in the same music video is too much for my heart but i swear i can take a little bit more of this, so please work together again.
love u so much
es demasiado está canción!! I love u❤
AAAAA I'M SO PROUD OF YOUU
NMMSS JOSHUA AYUDAAA
ABSOLUTE SLAY!
<3
THANK YOU

Amazing! Can’t wait for JB1 🤭🤩
Such a lovely song, Joshua's got something really special in his voice I always look forward to his music. I loved this
We love Joshua!! A great singer, songwriter, actor, model and social media influencer!!
2:14 obsessed with the run on “nowww”
i like how he said it’s coming out on august 12 and it’s 9:54 on the 11th🥳🤣🤣
💖💖💖💖

so so proud of you josh!!!! 💞
Love the song
Omg Joshua 😍😍
PSA for some people who might read the video the wrong way:   Cheating is not something that is romantic and the end of the video reinforces that. If you are in a relationship and like someone else that’s fine, end things before you do anything. If you are the one trying to break up a relationship, if that person was willing to cheat with you then that person will be just as willing to cheat on you. Please do not be that person who goes after someone in a relationship or go after someone while you are in a relationship. It’s okay to lose feelings and end a relationship, but it’s not okay to destroy someone’s trust which can ruin relationships for them for an extremely long time. Be kind people and don’t compromise your morals for such a small amount of pleasure. Trusting another human wholeheartedly will provide you so much more pleasure over the span of your life than one fling at a party.
This music video is so cute! <3 good job Joshua this is such an awesome some!

So proud of Josh he’s underrated and he’s honestly killing it😆🥳
mikey and the rest of the crew did a beautiful job!! this is gorgeous.

i love him sm 🫶🫶🫶🫶
josh truly never misses
THAT WAS SO GOOD WTH
Josh’s higher range🥰
Joshua I’ve been here’s since common sense and your have been my favorite male artist since than, I hope you continue the great work
love his song and the video, Joshua is amazing since I saw him in High School Musical The series. Off point, is it me or is that other guy an actor from Love, Victor? At first i wasn’t sure until I saw more of him, oh shoot…am I tripping?
*tour
Now among the favorites ✨💎👑🎙️
Can’t wait to hear this on your🤩
His voice is so delicate i love it🥺😍❤️
This is so good the video and the vocals😍🔥❤️🔥
Josh how do you sing every song song so gracefully I am in love with this song of yours I am so happy for that you came out with this song
UR AMAZING LOVE U WITH ALL MY HEART JOSHUA
This is unbelievable!!
he has such a peter pan vibe to him, he's literally so magical and his music sounds so whimsical- not to mention him looking like a Disney prince. Amazing song ⭐🪄
This is INCREDIBLE...l love josh so much....going to play this on repeat!!!!♥️😭
He's just stunning.
just the idea of this song is so genius. this connection or love is not good for either of the people involved and you know you shouldn't do it, like smoking. but since your already here and you've already started and you know that its not going to last, you'd rather just enjoy it while you still have it. his mind >>>>>
I love you Joshua💕
I’m screaming this is so good!!! I fell out of bed when I seen it pop up on my feed!!! 💙💙💙
u get me everytime
It's an absolutely lovely joshua bassett song❤❤❤, but....... isn't that micheal cimino in the mv?🤩🤩

Thank you Josh for dropping another amazing song!! I'm so proud of you and your music is really way too good. Love you so much ♡
ew this is bad, i'm so disappointed....unsubscribing 🫣🤨😐😬
Idk why but this song gives me august (by Taylor Swift) vibes and I mean that as a highest compliment. This song is a masterpiece ❤️
So who’s going to talk about this video condoning cheating? This is a terrible message????
that girl is so lucky getting a choice between josh or michael!! i am so jealous....
Love the song!!!!, great as always ❤️
Anyone else think that Josh and Michael should make a song together?
Slay
Me gusto mucho la canción 🙏
Omg this is so goooood!! I loved the song and Michael and you were amazing.
THE BRIDGE
YEAHHH
Your talent gives me chills. Everytime I listen to your music: chills. Everytime I see you acting: chills. Everytime I hear you playing an instrument: CHILLS.
the cinematography…wow
"Addicted to illusions of a love that never was or never will be anyway" Damn
yes yes yes another amazing song and vid !!!
Smoke slow was my favorite since the moment he released the snippets, still is. What a song, what an artist, what a writer. I love you more than myself Joshua.
JOSHHH u are my fav singer ily sm
Josh! This was literally amazing. You are such an amazing person and you music makes me so happy
This is going to be my no1 song at the end of the year i can feel it
I just watched the premiere while sitting on my phone on my hospital bed. this song is amazing and i've loved josh ever since he was in stuck in the middle. (btw if your wondering why im at a hospital its cause i had cancer some time ago and since monkey pocks is going around there are having to check me up so i have to stay the night) but theres no way i would miss this song :)
I already know this song word for word😅
I LOVE U BABY I MISSED U SM
I am going to love this song it will be so good I hope there will be more songs coming really soon I love Joshua's songs they are so amazing
wow😍
great song joshua  proud of you <33
I have been waiting for this release for soo long. Josh deserves all the love and praise
She asks for a light As our secrets spill on the window sill We're buyin' more time While we kill ourselves as we both inhale  Making believe there's a future Is it naive to think we could work? The second it's out, then I lose her We're already here, so one more won't hurt It won't hurt  But all that we are is all that we'll ever be 'Cause he's the one waitin' at home She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody There's only so far we can go Next to you, but I'll never be close So, take your time while you're mine and smoke slow  Breakin' away For the hell of it, started innocent I'm tellin' you things that I've never said Hope I don't regret this  Making believe that we're clueless One little spark that we won't put out Makin' a million excuses 'Cause isn't it fun just for now?  But all that we are is all that we'll ever be 'Cause he's the one waitin' at home She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody There's only so far we can go Next to you, but I'll never be close So, take your time while you're mine and smoke slow  Addicted to illusions of a love that never was And never will be, anyway (Ah), ooh And nicotine don't taste the same If I'm not with you savourin' every breath we take Play with fire, take me higher  All that we are is all that we'll ever be 'Cause he's the one waitin' at home She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody There's only so far we can go Next to you, but I'll never be close So, take your time while you're mine and smoke slow
And he is back with another single 🔥 Joshua, your songs just make my day better! Keep going ❤
IM IN LOVE
WHOOOU! THIS IS AMAZING!! ✨

JOSHUAAAA
This song and video are both so incredible!!! It's been such an honor watching you grow as an artist. Much love xx
I’ve never been proud of someone so much Joshua I’m so proud of you you are amazing you really deserve this song to go popular because it’s honestly so amazing
❤️🔥
La fotógrafia me recuerda mucho a euphoria AMOOO
bro that high note tho on "take me higher"
“wow a beautiful mindset…” (don’t smoke) BOO JOSHUA BASSETT
Josh’s voice with a new song is something I don’t think I could ever get tired of hearing. I’ve been a fan for years and years- his voice is comforting to me. Thank you Josh.
A MASTERPIECE
I have mixed feelings cause it's a sweet song with catchy melody but I can't help but feel uneasy with all the lyrics about nicotine and smoking. I love Joshua and he is so outspoken about mental health and I feel like this is not a song I'd expect from him.  And yes I saw the message in the beginning but that doesn't change the lyrics.
wowwwww josh really just did that huh…the BRIDGE❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Did they cheat 🤔? Or was that just him daydreaming? Cause either way poor other guy. He came to a party he obviously didn't wanna be at but did it for his girlfriend only for her to be eyeing up and sneaking away with another guy...
YOU. ARE. INCREDIBLE.
I know that the smoking bit of it is purely for visuals but the disclaimer went by too fast and I was very concerned...
JOSHUA!!! THAT HIGH NOTE!!!
THIS SONG IS EVERYTHING OMG THE BRIDGEEEE
i'm so proud of Joshua🥺❤️
JOSHUA BASSETT WTH THE SONG THE MUSIC VIDEO I JUST CAN’T 🤯🤩
This is way too good❤️🥹
Could you add captions so it can be accessible? It would be greatly appreciated if you can
I love Joshua Bassett's songs. It so beautiful and amazing that he always goes above and beyond. No matter what. We love Joshua Bassett and we always will
WOW!!!!!!! ANOTHER AMAZING SONG! Josh's songs are always so powerful and deep. That's what makes music. I am  really excited for Joshuas future and i think he should MORE than he does now. he is underrated. After all he has been through this is very impressive.
JOSHUA BASSETT YOU ARE A LYRICAL GENIUS
OMGG LOVE THISS, i'll never give up, the world should know about your art💗🥺
You’re an AMAZING singer and I love your songs!!! Hope more soon! I’m alr singing this one like crazy❤️❤️❤️❤️
The song, the lyrics, the lighting, the story behind it, THE BRIDGE, everything is beyond perfect.
