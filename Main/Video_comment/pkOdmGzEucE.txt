2025
i wanna be an egma now
I know that the mysterious decorations,  were lizzie's past lives 😊
like if your watching this in 2025 bc lizzie is the best
Do the nooks represent the previous origins? :3
for those who are wondering about the nooks in the spaces its representing her past lives
I love how cheeky and revenge is you are 🎉
rip parrot lizzie you had so much potential
thats so funny how she took revenge on lauren:D
"What the fff- Blazes is that?!"
That parot hunt took a dark turn
Kangaroo jump plus bird origin plus mace you have a God PVPer
Name mod
Lizzie blink twice if you're going insane
10:58 "what the f... Blazes is that?!" oop
Lizzie... we know where your base is... your map is open...
Hol up a sec...... The display are your lives!!!!!!!!!!! 😮🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
What is the mod for the pink jungle byom
One does Not simply walk into lizzie's secret cave😂
I LOVE THE ENGIMAAAAA‼️
HELP- WHY WAS LIZZIE SO CREEPY AT THE END
She says that we wouldn’t be able to understand her decorations And we would have to be some minds solving genius And I know what the decoration means it represents all her lives😉
"What the f-... Blazes😅"
2:15  haha
0:7 looolllll
each nook is every origin she experienced and the homes / biomes or looks of the origin
WHY DOES YOUTUBE COMMENT ON EVERY VIDEO MADE BY LIZZIE- (basically)
Decía BIRB EN LUGAR DE BIRD😂😂😂😂😂😂 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
No one is talking about how cool the enigma skin is! It incorporates a bit of everything from her past lifes, racoon tail, kangaroo and parrot sock, goolian arms and floran dress!
Not a "bird" its a birb
Each nok represents your past lives
Lizzie you are dying to much
I still cant belive she died from a fish! 😂😂😂😂
10:57 - Not Lizzie almost saying the F-word 💀💀💀
9:53 I solvwd it 😂😂 everye nook represents one of your lives
It's At spawn 8:51
Fun fact: u are reading this
I just watched this series after like 2 years and I felt so happy even though my days were gloomy but Lizzie,, I guess it made me felt so much better and calm?? anyhow,, 2 years ago I was so busy with sch,, now im still busy with works but this series is such a safe place and haven for me,, thank you Lizzie !! <3 💞🤭
Lizzie stop  dying lol😂😂😂😂😂
my fav part was seeing the "Joel- Hot & Big" teleport,, made me giggle
"what the f- BLAZES IS THAT"
Omg the amount of houses there are probably everywhere due to Lizzy dying 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Birb- 😂😂 0:53
Anyone else saw how it said “You have 6 lives left!” 💀💀
I think the reason she made those lil nooks is bc of all her origins lol
i was excited for the bird origin and expected her to have a treehouse 😭😭 but it barely lasted NOO
You show cased all your previous homes/lives in your secret cave
Pesky bird
I really love your videos and I hope I find the right video and game to come play with you then it's really hard to find this game of Minecraft afterlife is so hard to find but I'll find it some find it Sunday
You can never solve the puzzle behind this *her past life’s* and you will never know the way raccoons organise *rainbow order*
Lizzie only survied as a bird for only 2:21 minutes
It's of some of your lives lizzie because the rainbow part is for your parret self
All of the rooms are her lives😂
"what the f.... "oh wait im famiy friendly" what the blazes is that?!
i love how lizzie almost said the f word 😭
In your under Ground base the decorations where all the times you died
i know now you based the nooks designs from all of your past lives thats so cool👌
10:02 the rooms are based off her past lives
I think the nooks are all her past lives
Lizzie: Oh my gosh I can fly! Also Lizzie: You’ll be sorry you bird!
You'r past lives that's it I can tell
i figured it out, the one with red is for racoon, honeycomb one for floran, goo one for goolien,  one with cows and boat is for kangaroo, and  the colourful one is for bird
no one  lizzie:  survived 3 days as a racoon survived 2 days as a floral survived 1 day as alien survived 0 days as a kangaroo survived  0 days as a bird
10:57 lizzie no-😂😂😂😂
The fact that at the start of the episode she was a bird and at the end she killed birds 😭
0:17  I love how it says birb ❤
it seems I am a problem solving genius 😎
“WHAT THE  F-  *pauses*  …BLAZES IS THAT?”
10:58 / 13:00 lizzie got a bit surprised here
The decorations of other origin
Enigma is the perfect fit for lizzie, i was sad she d!ed😢
Not lying, but I thought she was about to swear 10:58 like she was so close to saying the F word
I LOVED THAT BIRD 🐦❤🕊️
I like when she said bla bla bla it remind me to dracula
I love that it says "birb"
for those who don't know: the decorations in her base represent her previous lives
I love how the little nooks represent her past lives
10:57 i was rewatching this series and never noticed she was about to swear here lmao 😭
you are not funny
I riley like were she can kill things with her iese
Is it a bird is it a plane it’s a lizzie 😂
Out of curiosity whose portal was that? The one that now has a guest
GLAD SHE FINALY WENT ONE EP WITHOUT DYING
Obsidian.😊
she was just a bird in 2 minutes then died immediately lmao
She looks like a parrot bc she can talk and the colour of her body so this might be my fav vid of the after life bc I love parrots
Girl it's not that much of a mystery and why are you building each of your  origins in building sections 😅 not trying to be mean sorry🤣
They way that Lizzie dies every episode is hilarious 😹
🐥🐣🐔🦅🐓🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦚🪶🪶🪶🪶🪶🪶
“What the Ff-“ “Oops im recording cut”
HOW-HOW DID LIZZIE DIE *AGAIN*
2:35 What are you doing lizzie , I was gonna say * she can keep an origin for one ep * but now I'm gonna say * she can keep an origin for 1/2 mins *  Edit 1: Edit 2:
I reckon that the decorated areas in the secret base are her past life’s because she may of needed a parrot because of her birb power then a floran! ❤        ❤ YOUR CHANNEL LIZZIE!!!
Did anyone else hear lizzy say oh fu....
What mods have used u always find the best mods lizzie
All off the decor is about her past lives 10:17
Her you’ll never guess. What’s there us literally all of her lives
She’s showing all her afterlife’s
Each nook is a different life she has had 🙂
Your house rooms are of your deaths
“what the f-“ -lizzie
Lizzie you spawned in a desert  because of your kangaroo  or goolian ability  Sssssssssss look back😂
Those who solved her mysterious house decor 👇🏾
Is anyone going to talk about how when Lizzie was a kangaroo she was meant to spawn in a desert… now she’s a bird and she spawned in a dessert…
Lizzie once said :”what the f—
I love it how it’s a year ago video did remind. Such a good time of the old times.😢
10:25 : You’re putting each room after your different lives!!!
I love how lizzie was about to swear and stopped herself and said something from minecraft instead
The nooks represent her lives
12:59 🎉🎉🎉        Can we just appreciate the perfect 13:00 video
Are the nooks pass lives
All of her past lives😂😂
10:57 conplete the sentence ahah
the moment when you realize you cant tame animas
I understand that wall it's all of her past origins😊
I love how Lizzie slowly becomes a villain in like all her smps
"What the f- BLAZERS is that"  Gotta keep it family friendly ik I'm a year late
Not lizzie turning British half way through
am i the only one who notice that in the beginning when she was a bird it’s said “birb?”
lol ❤
“Oh no my one weakness, being weak!!!!”
10:59 she almost cussed and YOU HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY A INOSKE
Okay no one talking about what Lizzie almost let slide at 11:00  Jk Lizzie love the content I mean I'm rewatching this a year later
"That was JOEL'S HOLE"😂
My new favorite quote: “What the f-…… Blazes is that!”
Is it just me how noticed the joke you’ll see get it she kills with her eyes
At the end she's losing her Sanity
Was I the only one that notice that it says Birb but it has to say Bird
The nooks i think represents her lives she went through idk
I love how you displayed all your origins in the nooks!
i love how lizzie cant stay alive for 1 episode
lizzy your so small as a bird well you are a bird can you be my pet bird ur so tiny!!!
Being something cool and quiet can also be a mistake and it comes with insanity sometimes and people using you, but sometimes you it comes with... REVENGE :) and I love your videos sorry if this sounds deadly or a threat its not any of those love your videos!!!
Seriously you die so fast😧
Did anyone here Liszt almost curse at 10:58? 😂
Birb
awesome!!! love senig unique origins and how you played into each one Perfectly🔥
OMG Why You Fly Ha ha ha ha😂 Plays Poop😂 🔥☀️
LAUREN KILLED LIZZIE AS A BIRD! SHE USED HER ANGRY VEX POWERS!
The little nooks are representing her different origins aren’t they 🤔🧐🤨🤨
8:28 Lizzie! You blurred out coordinates!!
I can’t even count how many times Lizzie died now! 😂
No the bird was so gooddddd 😢
You’ve been them characters
is it a dieing video or a parrot
It's called a wither monster
there's no such thing as to much!😊
LDbirdLady
The nooks are or were ur origins
I love how she’s not a bird she is a birb😂😂
The nooks resemble her lives
she respawned in a desert
I know what you're doing you're making all your lives creating them in your house

Oh no my one weekness  Being week Every person ever: OMG WHERE THE SAME TWINSIES
It makes me sad because I had a bird that passed away but still good
Not lizzie dying in every episode of after life😂😂😂😂
I think it’s so cool how Lizzie’s skin is the colors of the pansexual flag. I know she didn’t plan it but it’s cute
Easy previous lives❤
why is Lizzie always a short creature? 😅😂
is anyone noticing the reoccuring pan flag?-
It’s all your origins
In case anyone wants to know:  *Lizzie's Enigma Skin* Striped Tail: Racoon  Pink Main Body: Floran Green-TIpped Hands: Goolien Brown Leg: Kangaroo Rainbow Leg: Birb Horns: Enigma Blocked Eyes: Enigma *Lizzie's House* _Go to __10:02_ Furthest Left, Closest to Fireplace: Floran (pumpkin head, honeycomb, hive and blocks from the End) On The Right Side of Floran: Goolien (blocks that were used to build the original biome and the spaceship) On The Right Side of Goolien: Racoon (library and lecterns, to signify her house, villagers, and library she built as a racoon) On The Right Side of Racoon: Kangaroo (tree branches to signify wilderness, composter to represent the wheat she used to breed cows and annoy CPK) Furthest Right: Birb (rainbow colours are the same as the birb's skin, parrot heads)
Hi can I go to your server? Because I'm lonely I don't have reame of minecraft
I think the walls represent her pat lives

This is my favourite out of all your lifes!!! 🥰🥰🥰

IN THE FIRST TIME IN FOR EVERRR

Is it of your old homes that you lived in
It sound like she almost side the f word lol  Lizzy: WHAT THE F uhh blaze RODS!
the mystery in your secret house is that all the decorations represents all of the origins you have had.
Yes
at the end lizzie trys to be mysterious but then the outro music comes in and the vibe is gone
How do you get these origins? I wanna try it out myself please, that would be great
The way the pig just… flopped over and died💀
WHY couldnt you fly put the cave??!!

Why do she die every episode 😢😢😢😢😢
She themed it on her lives
You used all those decorations to represent yourOld life Old And that's why they are over there right

Double RIP Lizzie, double R.I.P
𝓦𝓪𝓼 𝓽𝓱𝓪𝓽 𝓯𝓻𝓲𝓼𝓴𝓼 𝓼𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓴?

10:57 I like how lizzie stoped herself from cursing 😂
I love how Lizzie dies every episode

Some of the nooks are her past lives
ik what the decorations are one for each life!!!!! raccon house end floral goolien parrot enigma am i correct?

You can fly out of the caw as a Bird 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wonderful work 😊
your eating away at your lives
You should have put in some lava in your headquarters👌
Ohh you built the base rooms for all of your past lives
😮😮oh ender man how i love you that u will kill me or i will to you
the rooms are themes on your first origins!
9:01 OH NO MY ONE WEAKNESS,BEING WEAK-Lizzie-
The Puzzle solving in ur base with the parts is meant to be a reminder of ur old origins
It’s awesome how you got a comment from YouTube Lizzie!
Love your videos ❤
“What the fu” Lizzie- there’s children watching Also Lizzie- blazing rods
What enigma Lizzie is doing with the little tiny spot decorations is all of her previous life
la la la lay la la la laaaa
The house decorations are about her past lives in the smp 10:03
I believe that her “mysterious nooks” were to represent her past origins. Like the wool one was the birb, the one with the pumpkins and plants was the floran, the red one with the pine tree sapling was the raccoon, and the one with amethyst was the goolian. But that was just my take on it.
I know her reasons…
Why can't you just get a lead Then get a fence Then attach the lead to the parrot and take it home And put the parrot on the fence it's that easy
Just realized your parrot skin is the pansexual flag. Nice!
Literally can't lie I'm so mad that Lauren killed Lizzie shes had to build a new fort every episode now 😢
I love how Lizzie was just like what the fffffff bnlazes is that I’m being attacked by a pig
Meaning Is that is from Lizzie s past origin s
I know what all the squares mean!! There all your past lives! Am I correct?
You are the best YouTuber in the world and I love all your videos because you are the best and I love your videos. Well I can’t explain it but you’re the best friend and I want to be your friend one day so please please can you like this message love HATTIE❤
Can you please do more Minecraft videos with you being a kangaroo love, HATTIE🎉
Lizzy you did all of your old life’s 😂😂 I thought that was in the past 😂😂
10:57, i love how lizzie was about to curse then saved it😭"what the f-, blazes is that"
her new enigma house is really majestic and mysterious
“My one weakness! Being weak!” -Lizzie.   “Lol😂” -me
i love to watch ldshadowlady cause she's so funny and amazing
The nooks and cranys display your origins😂
Oh no my only weakness!…being weak!  -lizzy 2022
OMG your the best and my best friend waches you
love the fact no 1noticed her say fuck you LOL
What is this mod???
Aw she based her house on the past lifes she had!
Haven’t even watched the whole video I think she’s gonna die again  (Edit): Yup she died again
I love after life keep keep it up😀😀😀😀
You helped me through my younger years cause that one time I fricking shäæt myself.
.
People normally know where your base is.
No bird
A bird
All the decoration is all your past life! 10:26
Her house is decorated for  her past lives
I love the parrot costume things I don't know what to call it😅
She spawned in the place where she was meant to spawn in for her kangaroo origin
But love this
She went crazy at the end 😞
“What the f- BLAZES is that!?” 10:58
10:57 Lizzie! Was that a swear?
The nooks are the origins, cow head is the raccoon, kangaroo is stick , and them bird is wool and flower is floral, I may have confused witch is witch but this makes sense! I cracked the enigma
Loving how lizzie basically has a new role every episode
HOW DO U KEEP DIEING- 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 sorry but it’s really funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
okay only now i realised this, but lizzie was about to say 'wtf' then she suddenly remembered this was a kid-friendly channel 😭
The parrot literally just lasted 2 minutes 😂
10:58 that was a close one 👀
Each Deco is her different life
Why do u die in every  episode like why you gotta be more responsible like yeah come on girl you can do it why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why . This was listen to ld shadow lady
2:32 just a time stamp of when lizzie becomes the enigma <3
Each decorations are  You past life
k if anyone is actually curious on what her base is 😭  They’re all based off of her past lives! just look really carefully <3
It is your afterlife people
You almost cursed! Lol You said what the f- BLAZERS IS THAT?! I still love your videos tho
Each life is a section :D
What the ffffffffbbbfffbbblazez is that? 😂
She was so creepy at the end
12:17 she didn't realise she can punch animals
Wow 2 whle minutes as a birb
no lizzie dying every episode is so funny she actually can barley do anything in each life except for the glorious ocean queen.
The rooms are the life’s she lived
Hi I love your videos and a pink hair and I think you'll be great
"WHAT THE Fffff BLAZES IS THAT!?"
The most shortest life
10:58 ahem.. lizzy..
You look so cute as a bird❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lizzie bird skin looks like a pride flag!
I nowe wat misteri dekrysen are all jour lives
Lizzie almost swearing 😂 What the F- Blazers is that?
Its kinda hilarious that lizzie dies nearly every episode
Emo lizzy emo lizzy 😸
(Whatever the animal is called) : +attacks+  Lizzie: what the fuuuu- blazes is that!
The nook's are all of her life's
Lizzie: I'm surprised I didn't die.  Also Lizzie: How did I die??
All of the little rooms are after all the life’s you had
we all know that the secret decorations are her past lives
I love how when she was the enigma, she built… (spoiler alert if you tap/click read more)          She built the nooks, and they resembled her past lives
Wtf
I've been watching you for 4 years and I just realized... You're British!
By the way the little areas and Lizzie‘s secret house is actually representing her past life‘s you can check them again there is one for the parrot raccoon etc.
“What the ffff- blazes is that!” 😂
y is anybody talking about Lizzie saying what the fu-
"What the f- BLAZASES ID THAT"
I figured out that her *decorations* represent all of the previous entities Lizzies been.
it took me this long to realize Lizzie's enigma outfit is a mix of all her past lives-
i think your nooks or from evry life you had! <33
is it just me who noticed- but Lizzie nearly swore
What th f—— blazes is that?
did anyone notice that the bird bio was called birb?!
2 minutes in she died lol
12:32  oh hell no this is creepy
The game:You are now a birb! The Zombie:Imma bought to ruin this man's *HOLE* career *she died in a hole*
Your videos are so good
Your base is based off what your life’s were😊😊in afterlife
smol eeny beeny teeny weenie uwu babi BORB
4:00
Lol it’s a blessing she’s alive longer then one episode
Lizzie, you spawned in the desert because of the kangaroo.
It feels like we’re flying but maybe we’re die ing
the end of the video: 😈💀☠️👻 the outro:💕🎀😽🫶🏻🦄
Ngl at the end she kind of sounded like a sociopath
the areas/ decorations represent her deaths!! kangaroo for the cows and boats all the annoying stuff she did to everyone the next by it is the floral one with honey (she could only eat that) the one by the floral is the alien one with the copper rod that was bolted at and the next 2 are probably the rat one and then the parrot one where she just died
I know what ur doing in ur secret base! Ur trying to resemble every life that u have lived in so far
10:57 the part where she said the f word
All Of the nooks is decorated for one of the lives that she had
“What the f- blazes is that?”
If you die in the end I’m going to scream 😇😈
girl you died soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  quick that when you where a bird that you fly
What are those-the pan colors!!!💗💛💙
It’s been to mins and she is dead😂She is amazing ❤🎉
I know the order that your walls are in there all your organs he he no😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s every place you live or built first was your one before the kangaroo your librarians area are you trade in your raccoon house I get it you just miss Home❤😊
Its funny because I instantly guessed her base to be her pass lifes.
When you realize that you cant tame anything so go with a killing tactic
I just realized her base is sectioned by each of her lives before her enigma life
As a enigma more like.a enderman because of the staring and teleporting
Anyone else realize Lizzie almost cursed when the boar attacked her “what the f”-Lizzie
9:56 they are your past origins right?
i love how she always goes “cooill”
The walls in lizies secret base is the walls of here different animal lives
Furst she was a raccoon and then a flower girl and then a alien and then a kangaroo and then and a birb and then another thing
It's obv just cute decor with no meaning  duh🙄.               This is a joke
The enigma is the definition of “if looks could kill”
NOOO I LOVED HER LITTLE BIRD COSTUME AND WHAT SHE COULD DO WHY DID SHE TRY AND FIGHT THE ZOMBIE
I just feel bad for the other parrots that did nothing and the red parrot Got away with it
Ya know the secret headquarters that LDShadowlady made had those holes with things inside of them they are actually based off of the orgins LDShadowlady
I keep seeing a lot of the pan flag. Was she trying to tell us something?
i love how she made each nook in her secret base themed after her previous lives!!!! its so cute!!! i love you so much and you made everything better during Covid!! keep doing you, boo!!❤🧡💛💚💙💜🥰
nnnnooooooooooooooo
You could have flew Lizzie!
I laughed at the time she was like"WHAT THE F... BLAZES IS THAT?
LIZZIE. THAT WAS CLOSEE  What the f- BLAZES IS THAT  LIZZIE BE CAREFUL  Time stamp - ; 10:56
I guess I’m a problem solver because, I think the nooks are supposed to represent all of her lives? The pumpkin and the end flowers reminded me.
I know the knooks one is the racoon and the other is the floran and the kangaroo and the goolein and the Bird 🐦
Not me knowing straight away that the nooks are Lizzys past lifes, I knowing this how bc the blocks in the blue and purple nook is the blocks she used in her alien Biome, and their were pumpkin stuff in the floral biome
the exact second i saw the bird, i paused the video, and was like "OmG pAn FlAAg ASDKJASDLKJ"
I love that the first thing Lizzie want to do is get revenge😂
"there it is.. THE JUNGLE." that got me dying
I think she was making it to represent all of her organs that she has had and I have not finished the video yet because there’s lotta stuff that she collected and stuff as a raccoon alien and a bird and also a flolofen
How cute but a bird
did anyone else notice that when it said she has become a bird it said birb (not 100% sure if it was spelt birb on purpose but yea).
I love that when she opens the way stone it says”Joel = Hot & Big”
I love how Lizzie said “well I went out of the world just how I came into it, in A hOooOole” she said it with calm anger😂😂❤️ 2:15
WHOS PORTAL WAS THAT she shoved a scary mob through 😂😂😂
What I think the "mysterious decorations" are is random stuff that represents her past lives & orgins
In the Orange room  It is all the places you used in previous lives
It’s how all of her different ability’s and I don’t know if I saw a area for the kangaroo
Ur not a bird ur a birb
Lizzie said its mysterious but the decorations are her former lives
Oh no my one weakness being weak that’s the most relatable thing I’ve ever heard in my life
Each area in her base represents each life
But how do you play it
Those little nuts are all of your life
She themed the nooks with her old origins
I love the bird I one 2
Don’t click read more
until she died
this is my favourite episode bc i love birds
“WHAT THE FFFF BALZES IS THAT”
i love you lizzie!!!!!!!!!!
2:09 🦜
It pains me to forget she can tp edit nevermind
On no Lizzy you went to the END why?
Enigma: the enderman killer
Birb
The rainbow room is a personal part of her life. It is that she's bysexual which means. That she likes men and women.
Lizzie s odd decorations are symbols of her last life
*I CAN FLY!* (a minute later) ….not anymore
20:57 she was about to say a bad word 😮
Heck, I know what your decoration secret is... AND I SHAN'T TELL YOU! MUHAHAHAHA
Lizzie: DEATH TO ALL ENDERMAN! Everyone else: LIZZIE!!!!
Omg Lizzie built all of her origins in her house
Her: You can ride other players😍🥺  Me: Dirty Mind Dirty Mind D-D-D-D-Dirty mind
I think lizzie’s nooks in her house are all her lives!
So once I heard she was I basically thought oh she’s basically kind of Medusa
I hate  you Lizzy.  I love bird s.
Chúc gia đình luôn hạnh phúc.... Được nhiều view hơn nhé !!!! 殺
the way you almost said the f word when you were getting attacked
10:57 LIZZIE WERE U GONNA SAY FUCK?

It’s atcherlee lorun who killed u
Omg I love how good your builds are they are secret and beautiful
Under the pronounce it said my name Madeleine
It’s all your origins
Just as Lizzy is my fav animal (parrot) she dies :(

4:25
🐦🦜🕊️🦢🦩🦚🦃🦆🐧
You look so cute and I like your little horns and your little Blandford it’s so cute❤❤❤
the little decor nooks are her past lives
i love how Lizzie makes a new house for every origin and just abandons her other ones 😭 and let's take a moment bc Lizzie almost said the f word on camera
She built something resembling each of her former origins
😊
Now
i no realize that she dies a lot
I have figered out all of the places in her house meanings!
I love how you decorate the noos with your past origins
At the end u littrily kind of freaked me out 🥲
*your videos make Me uncontrollably smile help I love u so much pls make videos forever aaaaa*
S bubble once become a birb too she died from banging into a tree
Her base looks like seapeekay blew up in it.
Lizzie: "what the f- BLAZES is that?!" Boar: "SKREEEEEE"
You can't tame a parrot 🦜🐦
Her base shows all of her lives.
10:57 she almost cussed😆
10:56 lizzie almost cursed 💀
“what the f-f-f” 😧 she was close..
I know this is like, MONTHS LATER but, Lizzie’s decorations are based off her previous origins.
I know what the headquarter thing means it repressing all her organs parrot as a bird the stick raccoon library her villager moment idk why bee pumpkin and Enders gone is her being the end florist
Your so cool
10:58 DID SHE ALMOST CUSS EXPLAIN SHADOWLADY🤨
Being a parrot was a short lived dream
In the one where she needed the bird hands in probably represents the origin she had before
I think I figured out what the nooks of mystery are I recognize some of them being part of one of her origins
Love the fact that the thumbnail and title didn't spoil the enigma
Yay 😀
Her nooks are literally her past orgins
Sorry but when u said my only weaknees being weak you roasted yourself.
Aw you're so nice Lizzy I love you everyday so much
Comment thứ 18

Wow Lizzie !😆😆
Imagine looking at an enderman would it kill it? (Sorry I just edited this I hadn’t watched the full vid yet 🤣)

Ur decorating ur house with nooks of every animal you have been
I can fly!  for 50 seconds
SHE WAS A BIRB- FOR 2 MINIUTES 💀💀💀😭😭😭

Me understanding the decor 🤔

I guess I’m some kind of genius because I figured out what the nooks mean! They were her past origins <3
It's all her past life's
10:58 lizzy nearly swears (she lives to regret)
You’re running out of lives 😂
OOOOMMMMMGGGGG
Oh my gosh the mysterious things are what you were
I love how she gets new onesies for every new origin they’re so cute!
"what fffff- blazes is that!" 10:57 LOL
I know what the Holes in your walls are it's all of the origins that you have been!
Second victim mhahahaha
Is no one talking about Lizzie almost swearing-
What the f- Blazes
is it in spawn :0
Lizzy those areas in your to orange fort are obvious themes it's the past origins you've had :/
I love how lizzie build its all so cut and funny
I love how you made the boxes your old ones (parrot,raccoon,alien,flower thing)
i start literally crying laughing when the boar was chasing her 😂😂
i liked the part wen she  ran so fast
Right when she said why is a cat there my cat walked right in to my room
It’s so funny that your keep dyeing every ep lol
Lizzie was a bird (sorry a birb) for like 2 minutes then became the enigma
She dies every episode lol
The last part😂😂😂❤,love your vids
She died 😂h-her😂first day😂😂😂,R.I.P lizzy
Lizzie almost said what the fu*k is that 🤭
I laughed out loud when she punched that thing through fWhips portal.
The oufit is soo cute
HAHA!
Love you Lizzie
Me and my friends are playing that mod and I’m a parrot
Omg I love of she plays the role of what she is
**I could fly x
What the f- blazes is that made me laugh
:)
The rooms was based on your lives
bro it got scary on your last line you used ur mysterious voice and it was scary 🥺🥺🥺
I love it how Lizzie is just like invincible the whole time
you should name a villager bert😜 or red
I get it the rooms in the house are from all your different organs
You Can Defeat The Ender Dragon Easily
7:34 what-
'What the fv- blazers is that?'
The parrot area is from her birb origin
Her being  an enigma she mixed all her past origins skins together!
She is a pan flag :D
As soon as I saw Saw that blue slime I immediately knew They were her past lives
When Lizzie got the parrot head she sounded physco like when she put the parrot head down and she said perfect
Even though Lizzie has short lives, she always takes advantage of her abilities. Excited to see what you do next as an Eigma in your next episode!
Lauren said I killed you she just set up that trap
In the first part she was sad then it took a DARK TURN
No one's talking abt how her feathers we're the pansexual flag?
Every wall is a different origin
LIZZIE!!!
OH MY GOSH!
lol I’m sorry
Am i the only one who noticed that Lizzie nearly swore? 10:57
No one has said it but I think the water fall is from the slime orgin
The décor in lizzies enigma house represents her past lives. Atleast, some of them do. The bee hives are definitely the end floran life. The parrot head one is her birb life. The purple one with the copper rod is from her alien thing one. The others i am not sure of. Maybe the one with the compost and log with a plant might be her Racoon life. The others maybe from other series.
I think i get the house design. The random stuff on walls are her previous orgins!
I know all the mysteries things on the walls are your life‘s
lizzie: *softly* what the- the boar: get attacked.
I instantly knew what you were doing with the decoration
U kinda die every single episode- lol
What mod is this?
RIP Birb Lizzie  0:15 - 2:15
Did Lizzie swear... was that just me who caught it
Anyone notice the skin was pansexual colors?
It scared ME when you were in the nether
Lizzie : OH MY GOD WHAT THE F- blazes is that!  Me : are we going to ignore that or?
u can phase through blocks
Pan bird Pan bird Pan bird pan bird pan bird pan bird pan bird pan
what the f- BLAZERS is THAT??
You died as a bird because Lauren was sending her hatful thoughts as a Vex.
10:58 family friendly
"what the ff....................." is what she said
10:57
At 10:58 Lizzie was about to say the f word “what the f… blazes is that”. I’m not saying it’s bad XD I would of been scared too lol.
They look like they represent everyone of her  life
I love how she says bird instead of birb
Did anyone realize that lizzie has a pansexual flag in the bird skin and her new skin?
love how you decorated the little nooks based off your past lives
All of those nooks in your house in the waterfall were beautiful and from all of the roles you have experienced
your secret base means your past lifes i put 2k bucks on that
10:57  "whAtt thEee ffffff- blazerrsss is thAt
I love how she died only 2 minutes after the video started
When she said I've fallen down a hole it reminded me of the meme I've fallen down and I can't get up
What the f…. Blazes is that !
The mystery decorations are all her origins
Hey Lizzi, if you stare at the endermen they wont do anything
Birb
Lizzie: WHAT THE FFFFF- BLAZES IS THAT?!
lizzie is not a Bird she is a Birb look in the bottom left when she respawns
I love how her wings are the pan sexual colors
10:57 HAHA THE LAUGH I JUST LET OUT
Who else noticed at 0:16 it said you are now a birb not bird
a fliyying bird! what the does this even is in minecaft a lizzie bird funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
Enigma Lizzy was honestly frightening. 😶😂 Yeeeeperz!
I understand the rooms 🤣
7:28 is it just me or is that one sock the pan flag?
Not even 10 minutes has passed and you died already as a parrot😭😭
Hey Lizzy you know don't kill you with zombie
Your decorations are all of your things you have been
Lizzie forgetting she’s family friendly “what the f—“
As sad as it could be that Lizzie keeps dying and having to restart, it's also really fun because we get to see what having so many different origins is like as opposed to just one!
Lizzy: you need to be a genius  Your home is a remberance of your previous lives
what the f- blazes
Each nook represents each of her origins that she's had the raccoon is the red one the alien is the one with amithist and the one with the bee hive is the floren that was really cool for you to do that Lizzie (if I'm right)
Wait, are the mysteries she made how she died in her past lifes?
Lizzie wat mods are juesd in afterlife                                                                                    sorry for the spelling misstaks
Did anyone else notice that her bird skin had the pan flag colors lol💖💛💙
I feel bad she keeps dying because of other things that aren’t really her fault
what the ffff——- blazes is that?! 😭😭
I love the way Lizzie says “cool” ❤️
Can you stare someone of the server to death by staring?
Good idea to kill the enderman. 👍
Love the pansexual flag bird suit. Don’t know if she meant to do that or not but I love it.
“What the Fff- BLAZES” Me : lol 😂
the akward sqeak
i wonder if she knows that lauren killed her when she was a bird
10:57 What the f-  12:12 Lizzie could've just killed it with a cookie If she can
did you know in mincraft wooden fences dont conect to glass
Did anyone else hear her almost say the f word loll
I was so sad to see she had died 1 already in 1 EPISODE
The nooks are your past lives :D
I was watching Every video I’m obsessed you die like every video it’s so funny🤣😂
SLAYYYYY
the amount of pan color combos in her builds lol
808
No offense but I like to see Lizzie die because I like to see what she turns into
Pesky bird
The decor in your base is all your origins! Or, some of them! Yes! I solved it! I think-
So basically, as an enigma she just gaslight everyone.💀💀   (Making them question their sanity, thoughts, and emotions)
STOP DIEING!!!!!
the wired colors are for her past lifes i got it as soon as i saw it
"I Can Fly!"   ....For about two minutes
All of the nooks are just your other lives, am I correct?
I have a bird
Lizzie:what the f-
that little bird chrip at the end when lizzie died xDD
i think i figured the mystery out, it’s all of her lives in little compartments
The decorations are all your lives it’s not hard
I don’t know if it’s just me but I think her room things are her life’s
At 10:58 Lizzie almost cursed she said “what the f-“ (this isnt any hate btw so dont hate on me in the comments)
Just catching up on the videos I missed annnnd at 2:18- I think you was rather well into your bird roll... 2 cute chirps just like the books description had said
Lizzie how many times are you gonna die
i was so excited to watch lizzie as a bird😭but this is so fun
Did anyone else when lizzie got attacked by the boar, she said "OH, WHAT THE F- Bloody heck is that?"
OMG you are the best youtuber i have ever seen
OMG you are the best youtuber i have ever seen
Nice
You are a brilliant youtuber
It’s your past lives
When she said “I need a bird” I found out what she was doing, SHES MAKING A LITTLE PLACE FOR EVERY ORIGIN SHES HAD! That’s cool.
What the f run
the decorations are infact a representation of each life she has lived
Does anybody know the seed for this
i know what she doing for the rooms she is doing each origin that she had
Bet shes gonna die later or next episode😏
Lol Lisa is you die to much 😂😂😂😂😂
Almost said the f word
It’s all your life’s
can you only get these bioms on pc mincraft not xbox?
Sighs* Lizzie you need to stop dying
What mod is this? It is sooooo cool!
her villion origon story
OHHhh I just realized what the decorations mean!!
I know it’s showing all the different lives you’ve had in after life
"I decided to log out for a few days and ponder my existence" Had me laughing so hard 🤣🤣
She was going to cuss
sale in your house off all the lights do you hat
Lol no one was noticing her house is based off her old origins.Idk why no one is talking abt it
Is it just me or did Lizzie almost say the f word at 10:57 but instead said blazes-
You die WAYYYYYYY auto much
I’m thinking that all of the little rooms are all of her different origins
To kill. A pig for43 second’s
And people thought raccoon Lizzie was evil…
All the nooks are her pass and life now (enigma)
Each nook is ment to represent your lives over the series. That's why you need a bird to symbolize the birb life you lost to a zombie
HER BASE IS EACH ORIGIN SHE WAS. If that wasn't obvious
Umm she said what f-
10:57 "WHAT THE FFFFF- blazes"
Can you trick Joel please Lizzie to complete the Castle and give him a wooden sword
uhhh Lizzie became really creepy 😭 12:50
no you are a birb
When Lizzy was looking at her abilities where it says what you are a birb
Lizzie: YAY WINGS *five minutes later* No more wings
She said what the f—-blaze is that
Floran was my fav
She used the blocks as her past lives in her decor. SOoooooo I am a puzzle solving genius.
Why do I understand her decor???? Am I also part Enigma?! Cool
I think the decorations were of her other origins?
Everyone ones talking about her decor but not her almost swearing at 11:00?
Her dec is something to represent all her lives
the thing that she almost swears when she gets scr- nevermind
Lizzie you killed parrots like that my pet parrot killed because of a cat 😢😿
Can anybody let me know if you find what mods she uses? I want them lol.
I think those nooks are everything you’ve been in afterlife SMP
I was so exited for the riding bird thing then u died😭😭
I just realized that every one of the little things in her new enigma base is for each origin she’s had.
Please do this again I love itttt❤️❤️❤️💗💗💗♥️♥️♥️💞💞💞😊😊😊💕💕💕💖💖
The fact that she almost said a bad word when the pig chases her 😭😂💀
Every little decoration in lizzies house is all of her Origins :)
1:10 I could already do that
lets just say she dies evry epsode
So am I the only one who acknowledged the fact that she almost cussed-
Why is no one talking about how she almost said the F word 10:58
10:57 she nearly said wt-F. Lizzie : WHAT THE F... oh wait.. *my viewers are watching, Pg.. Pg...  Lizze : .... F-.. BLAZES IS THAT!  It's OK everyone has that one thing they don't want to show, this is just a joke... Literally don't kill me. Or take this seriously 😅
So you decorated each little outlet as the oragens youv had Im gussing
maybe her layer is under seepeekays house
“My one weakness.. being weak!” ME
You made every nook for each short life you’ve lived
LD: I BELIEVE I CAN FLY I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE SKYY
Before she ever got to the end I knew what she was doing
Anybody else notice that Lizzies sock (one of them) is the colors of the pansexual flag? I'm just saying, not meaning that its suppose to look like that
I feel like Bird Lizzie's spawn is kinda adding insult to injury to Kangaroo Lizzie. Kangaroo Lizzie was trying to get to a desert and then Bird Lizzie spawned in a desert
All of the knooks are your past lifes
She died 2:12 into the video
(Sorry for the late comment my exams were going on so i couldn't see this episode ) Lizzie everytime she sees a new biome- "This is the most beautiful biome i have ever seen"💜
Wait so your Jeff hardy
I feel sorry for u
Ohh I know the mystery of the room the little areas are her old origins
Is nobody noticing her sock? It’s like the pansexual flag!
Lizzie: what the f-  *pauses*  *remembers she can't cuss*  Lizzie: what the blazers
You spawned in the dessert cuz ur last origin was kangaroo which spawns in the dessert
Hi I been watching you when I was 5
I’m guessing the reson fro the secret mystery thing is it represents each life the raccoon house the parrot the kangaroo and the others
Fun fact : lizzie enigma place has something that remind of lizzie past origin for example The bird area ( her bird origin ) or The boat area ( her kangoroo origin ) And The compos area ( her racoon origin )
The decorations mean all of her lifes!
‘Die pig!’ - Lizzie, the enigma
I think a little sections in her home is her past houses 🏡 or could be so random sh-…. stuff
10:57 omg lizzie
c'était drôle comment quand lizzy a été attaquée par le sanglier, elle a presque dit le mot f lol
i love have lizzie was like "what the f- MIND:oh im on yt "    "blazes!
Why is Enigma Lizzie so scary? 💀💀
The stuff in her house are the mobs she was
Did anyone notice that it said “Birb”
When she said she's going to kill endermen I realized something... Isn't she a enderman because of her powers
the reason you spawned away from spawn was because you were a kangaroo last life and it only changes your origin after you respawn so you still had the kangaroo origin when you spawn then changed to birb
That ending was so creepy. Great way to end it.
l love how eve 😘😘😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💖
all of them represent all of the animals you have been in the past before you died am I correct
fact that you die in almost every episode ;0
I love these vids
The alcoves are remnants of her past origins!
Lizzie: Stares at boat in middle of ocean, AFK getting mcdonalds, Lizzie: Now has to swim
PANSEXUAL BIRD
who else found out about her little sections? if you didnt they were based on her past lives
I love how every time she build her build she die it’s kinda funny
``SORRY, whoever's portal that is but you have a new guest, a guest has arrived, and his name is death.`` -Lizzie
lizzy finding new biomes, "*gasp* this is the most beautiful biome i have ever seen!!" says this for the millionth time lmao <3
There is never to much orange.
The decorations are all of her lives
IT WAS SO FUNNY HOW SHE WAS TRYING TO JUMP OUT WHILE SHE WAS GETTING DAMAGE SHES SO SMALL LMAO
The theme for your base is obvious each part of the little decoration sections is for each of your lives like the one that includes a beehive that's from when you were in and flooring the one that has the sticks and the sapling in a pot that's from when you were a raccoon and the one that has the colors and the parrot head is from when you were a parrot
The mysterious declarations are every origin she ever had I'm a genius
You are the best I wish I can play to love you girl
i have figured out the puzzle its the old builds you made
I think I heard u say what the fu-
you should go around creeping people out.
10:58 Lizzie almost said a bad word
Great!
I know the mystery
10:58 what were you going to say lizzy? 🤨
“lizzie dirs the 100th time” the chat : noo lizzie , rip bouncing kangaroo
bruh
The little areas on the walls of different things might be stuff having to do with her past origins
The decor is her past lives o.o
Are we just gonna ignore Lizzie biting back a swear?😂
Best plot twist in minecraft history
I now the secrate of the decorations its like the red one is when lizzie started she was a raccon and her house was red and she needed the parrot for the life where she was a parrot
She played for 2 mins and she died 😢
What!!
You call me the o2
How will this series end??!!?!!
“What the f-…. Blazes is that” 😂😂 almost slipped up there
is her secret base decor is all the past origin she got
okay (3x) so far she has been:Racoon, Floran,Alien (i think) Kanagroo,Parrot, something with e.       seriously.
Moreee
title: I CAN FLY! also: *dies*
Wow she survived a whole episode as a origin!
1:10…. I’m not even gonna comment… if you know you know
the nucks that she said is all her lives in blocks
8:51 idk why but the first tool in her toolbar looks like the blackpink lightstick
Series idea: ~Axolotl craft~ (Its a series with your friends btw) Rules: Everyone gets 1 axolotl and if it dies, your series is over. You will have to hide your axolotl and attack other bases!   Side thing if ya wannna add it: Every episode a player is chosen. That player must take out another players axolotl or there own will be gone and the series OVERZ  (Sry for bad gramar)
The bird outfit is in pan colors!!!!
“WHAT THE F- BLAZES IS THAT!?” -Lizzie
I’m very very small??  Relly
mmmm  lizzie: *WHAT THE F---- BLAZERS*
Little nugs are based on her old basis and old life’s
I like how the nooks are her different origins
all of the mob list please?
I think each nook represents a life
Bruce Bochy put in the walls are all your lives hang out like to represent your lies :3
They're memories of her past lives
her character kind of looks like gojo satoru from jujutsu kaisen
The nooks are her past lives
I love how u scary at the end when ur talking, but then u have that cheerful outro. XD
Omg she accidentally showed her place in the waterfall omgggg
I’m convinced she’s trying to die 10 times so that she doesn’t have to keep uploading 😭
Lizzie that says birb not "bird"
Let me tell y'all her decoration are her origins though out the past it was easy Lizzie
"WHAT THE F-- BLAZES IS THAT"
She was attacked twice, each by pigs. revenge for the pig killed at the start of her enigma origin.
i feel like lizzie dies in each episode...  Fun!!
Lizzie when getting chased by the boar/pig - “What the ffff————blazes was that????
Love how her colour scheme is the pan flag lol
I love how every series lizzie ends up being a villain
I think lizzie is going to die first  What about u guys
Ik the gap thing there all her organs she has had
You are enigma
The enigma   Come kill you
its a birb its a plane its a lizzie
I always watch your videos especially your afterlife ones!!!
the nooks are all your past lives!!
History walls
let me guess, she'll die in this episode??  EDIT: ALREady?????😭😭
Lizzie all those thingies are your old origin
i like how the "mysterious decorations" are based off her past origins.
Who else saw the colors look like 👁👄👁
12:18 incel mind be like
Are those mysterious decorations your last life's? 👁👄👁
How many times has she died???
Her secret base isnt that secret because of the minimap
each small room in her house is all her after lives
I had a Orange Candy wen you set that
did no one notice she almost said the F word at 10:58
12:33 I was like 'WHAT THE FU-
I like who the little rooms have to do something with her last origins
The little rooms are her past orgins
One thing I find funny lizzy won't show us the location of the base but the mini map dose just that
Lizzy: What the f-    blazes
Lizzie: Everyone hates me! Me: I don't you're the best youtuber ever!
I love how you decorated your base from your past reincarnation Raccon, Floran, Alien, bird, and your new reincarnation form (forgetting what is it called at the moment)
I just realised that each nook and decoration is what each of her origins have been!!!!
It’s not a mystery because every single place is like your life you have a living
Each nook has to do with a past life?
Once you finish the game, will you do more Minecraft challenges? You are my favorite YouTuber!
The nooks are for lizzie's previous origins!!!
She’s not even a birb for 5 minutes
Idk why bot te orange reminds me of kingdom craft
Build  something  in the  nether at Ep9 please
Lizzie’s Nook and cranny’s in her home resembles her past lives lol
The mysterious decor is her old origins. It should be called the headquarters of fallen life
her mysterious decorations are from each origin she has had in this series lol
you recreated the things you become as
Its like the amihis biom
lizzie saved herself saying "what the blazes" 😭😭
Fun fact Lizzies house is based on all of her origens
each room represents one of you're origins
All of the nooks are the past lives of lizzy
Everyone is talking about how Lizzie is decorating her nooks with her past origins, but did anyone else notice how Lizzie nearly swore but said "blazes" instead 😂
You CANT fly no more!
I like how lizzie said plumage
she died 5 times
WHAT THE F-…. *BLAZES* IS THAT?!
I I oveyruviteyos
When you remember your family friendly 11:58 Lol
She’s officially lost it.
this is why i love lizzie. She changes her whole damn identity based on what origin she gets. Talk about dedication
What the F- *Lizzie Thinks* 🔥Blazes🔥 is that?!
I know what the things mean when I saw the alien stuff😈😈😈
The decorations are your past origins
Ldshadowlady i think we know where your secret location is you know on the left side of the screen there's a map a very clear map 😂  Oh i like this video it's awesome
Lmao the suspicious walls in her secret base represents her past origins
The mysterios decorations are her past origins
I was in the living room with my family when Lizzie said what the fhhhh blaze is that!
Who else got  all the things that she was building in her new base?  Like straight away off the bat
Lizzie tried not saying the badword is so funny-- 10:57  Its a family friendly channel
I don't think you're gonna make it to 10 episodes
What the f—- (remembers she’s family friendly) blazes is that?!
Hi Lizzie I just wanted to say you have inspired me to become who I want to be I ❤ ur vids
Im pretty sure the nooks in her new base are from all her origins
I love how your avatar and your house are both inspired by your past origins!
she almost swear when she got attacked by the pig
All those holes in the wall are super cool, and it's so obvious what its used for. 😂😂😎 love your videos
That barracuda sure got you Annoyed… wait- THAT WAS YOUR JOB!
recognize some of the blocks that you used in the mysterious place. I look like your older lives like a reference back to them.
The nooks are her past lives 🥺
the nooks represent her old lives
I love the pan flag on her character 😭😭
I feel like she is going through lives a little to quick😭
The nooks look like her past origins. Does anyone think so aswell, or is it just me?
10:58  “what the ffff—“   “BLAZES IS THAT-“
I done it it is your other Origins!
I know the reason for this
I know what the mysteries are there all of her prievious origins
The spaces are from her orgins
Remember when it said kangaroos respond in jungles
Im pretty sure each wall is one of the past lives
The whole thing where lizzie's origins have been lasting less and less time is great because she literally had 2 origins in one video. Hopefully enigma lasts her longer
Oh no you are losing lifes
Your base is every origin you have been
Y’all that 10:56 she also said the word lol
Where she made a little sections in her secret face I figured out what she meant every time she had a new life she made that a section in her base
All the different things like the.slime and bout and cow.heads are you're past life like the stick is the raconn
its all  your dead origins
I’m assuming that the little nooks are her past lives.
She’s gonna die every episode 🥹
You can't take stuff lizz lol!
Hey >:( stop being mean to birds
pin?
7:22
I figured it out the things that she built are the origins that she got
The crafted mystery is all the origins from her past!
Hey if you’re gonna get a cat as a pet in Minecraft I’m wondering if you could name it Alani
It only took me two seconds to figure it out
Lizzie: i can fly **few mins later** **dieds** nope nevermind
New title:I died straight away
I am a proud zSider but she LAVAed you it's time for revenge... Again...
“Oh no! My one weakness. Being weak!”
the nooks she has are all the origins she had which u probs know
Guess I’m a problem solving genius cuz I was like those r ur previous life’s
The nugs are the other origins
At 10:26 all of the nooks were representing your past orgins!
Are the decorations signs of your other origins like the crystal and slime for the alien parrot 🦜 for the bird?
Enigma is a literally a combination off all the old origins she had  PS. The hardest thing abt bieng an Enigma is ,You mistake your back to be your front bcs of the blind fold 1. Her clothes are from the floral Origin 2. Her arms are from the Goolien 3. Brown sock from the kangaroo  4. Colorful rainbow socks from the bird 5. Racoon tail
At 10:57 she says “What the f” according to CC, I know the subtitles are a flawed system here on YouTube. But. Did Lizzie nearly say the F word? I’ll let you decide.
I  know the what the decorations are!!  They represent all her other origins!!
Lizzie those "mysteries" in your base are decorations of your past lives (I know most people know this but I just wanna say it and I'm happy she chose orange! ::DD)
I like how it says birb
the nuks are you origins
Lizzie you respawn in a Desert because in your kangaroo origin it said you respawn in a desert
The mystery of those things in her base are her past lives that she died in!
I saw the house and realised the secret at once let me guess your past lives
Um I think I know now all the decorations in Lizzie’s base represents all of the origins she’s been like the parrot heads are for birb Lizzie
I can’t believe she almost died to a pig 🐷🤣
Wait are the nooks each representing one of her old lives??
oh my god she almost sweared-😳 WHAT THE F-BLAZERS
i just noticed that her enigma skin are a mixture of her previous skins
im starting to think lizzie is going to go insane with this new origin XD
I pray you will live a really long time this time.  So sorry Liz BUT you really need to use more of the rain bow other then pink. NOOOOOOOOOO  :(   :(  :(   :( Why are you dying so much??? Will your new killing power work on Joel???
2:46     OMIUA MOU SHINDIE NANI
Cool! Each area is a past origin!
How do you die so often?
I know what those nutches are it's what orgin you were
Lizzie haw do you get furniture in Minecraft
lizzie: heres my top secret headquarters. the location of wich shall remain a secret.  me: its in the nether 100%  lizzie: the only clue i will give you, is that it has a secret waterfall entrens  me: wha- well i guess i was wrong.... unless?!?
she built her past lives in her base
"wHat the ffFF- bLAZes is that!?"
Your British is so cute!
Ok so remember lizzy said “why you have to be a mind solving genius to solve this” and the nukes repesent her past lifes Like the 1st room (raccoon lizzy) 2nd room (floren lizzy) 3rd room (gooblien lizzy) and the library i think its the egnigma cuz people dont Know her region
I'm guessing those are your past lives/lifes?
I quite like how you put every transformation in you base as decoration
LIZZIE LAUREN WAS THE PERSON THAT KILLED YOU AS A BIRD!!!!
okayyyy lizzie pushed that thing through the portal and THATS WHAT KILLED ANGEL SCOTT- atleast i think
I think the nooks are describing her past origins
Lizzie dies every episode;-;
I’m less then a minute in but I noticed her parrot is the flag colors of the pansexual flag from the LGBQIA+ community.
Did anybody notice that the enigma of decorations were her past origins
I like how lizzie has a pan sock
If looks could kill…
The rooms are her old origins
this is so funny from a cute birb from and villain enigma
😷😭😖❤💜💚💛💙
I was laughing so hard she almost sweared, anyways super later but love the skin
All Those Decorations Define Every life of her
I love how she accidentally gave away where her secret base is
As the Enigma, she could just start a long conversation. Stare in their eyes-
You get the funniest origins, don't you?
"Oh wait they did a murder.."   -LDShadowlady  2022
were you about to say what the fudge bar😧😦😦😦😦😦
Wait is all of those walls all of your past origins
Lizzie is gonna get eliminated out of the sever first
Do you wanna know who killed you? Lauren killed you because she was jealous that you can fly and she… Well… Her flying wasn’t cool enough. At least that’s what she said!
Mystery’s are all her life’s that she died with
10:58 oooo Lizzie said a bad wordddd
To decorate your walls  you put all your life’s and how you lived it on the wall
Omg i love your vids
The mysterious things in the hideout are all your life’s the raccoon was your house the amethyst was your alien life the cow one was the kangaroo on how you put all the cows in the castle and the parrots was the three wools based off your pattern of a parrot did I get it right?
the nooks are all her old lives
u died literally 5 minutes into the game!
NOOOOOOO
You died so many times! LOL
I know the secret password it’s all of her Origins
More than an Enigma by the end she sounded like a psycho to me.....
I know what the decisions are, it’s her life’s that she has had
LUKE😇😚😘😙
...@    100  ,000 $😨😉⛄🎬🎻♡♡♡♡《😶😄😅😖💜💛💚💙❤💋💕💓💝👄
When you realize the decorations are all her past origins
OK  SHE IS TO POWER FULL SHE CAN KILL  JOEL . PLS KILL FWIP FOR NOO REASON
I love it that she put all her origins in the secret area
Oh my gosh lol pls stop dyinggggg
My face when you died as the parrot😭
And your videos
I love your powers as a Enigma!
I like how het new origin  outfit is a combo of all of her skins
I wanna be a bird🙂 they are my favourite animal 🦜
Won't be like that for long >:)
The problems or mystery are easy there all Lizzie role,s in afterlife
They are the lives you've been through that you have dived in Aphrodite SMP in your secret face
I know what those mysterious decorations. It from all the homes you had
Woah,Your vids are sooo good😊
The nooks in her secret base are a reminder of her past origins
i get l shadowladies decorations the bamboo is based on her racoon life the coral is based on her floran and I think  the boat is kangaroo life
Love how her decorations are themed after her past origins!
im in love with a parrot doot doot doot
I love how u make your origins into a house and the houses always turn out cute!!
Not even 3 minutes and its a new origin lol!
2:14 this is why we read the instructions
...can anyone else just imagine a server wide riot against lizzie
2:18 that was fast (also how do I join the smp)
it's so cite how she showcases her previous origins as "mysterious decorations"!
I just searched what an enigma then you just showed my exact search when I came back
If you’re an enigma and can pass through walls… why do you need an entrance?
7:49 Was that the pig or lizzie? lol
Ho my  gosh
where you got clay that place was really pretty
“What the fu- blazers is that.”
Are the corners based off of fhe diffrent episodes or orgins she's taken on
Her houses mystery is literally all about her other origins
best I love you so March,🤭😀😀
And Lauren tried to kill you BC you can Fly but then you got killed by a zombie
The "fish" that killed you was Actually a SHARK
I can’t wait for part 10
Can’t wait for this ten episode series called called afterlife but Lizzie dies every episode!
omg ik what those nuks mean those are youre origins that you died in
The cutest thing can't be the most dangerous Mons-
I noticed
2 mins into the new origin she dies
I think I understand some of the decorations! The amethyst one with the copper rods and alien goo blocks represent when you were an alien the pumpkin flowers and bee hive section represents when you were a florist and I think the one with red wallpaper is when you were a raccoon! I hope I don’t sound ridiculous!
You where a Perot fera like a min at
I havent watched the video yet but i'm praying to god that she does not die again-   Edit: Lizzy you just started your life a bird and you died to a zombie atleast your new orgin is cool
soo cute
I love this but what mod do you use?
I think your mystery decorations are your life’s like e.g the random stick, composter, a pot with a tree in it and the red background presents the raccoon life (I think)
All of the decoration symbolize her past lives and the pranks she has done.
Shes doing the decore based on all the lives she's lost like the parrot and raccoon
You died because of lauren
Izzy i watched Laurens video and she said that she will kill everyone who can fly so i think Lauren killed you?!?!?!
the diffrent rooms in lizzes house is all her other origins i think so
The weird decorations are for her lives
🌌
I think the weird decorations are her previous origins. (Racoon is the weird spurce one, Florine is the end and honey themed one, Gooline is the copper and amethyst one, Kangaroo is the white cow one that represents her pranks, Birb is the decapitated parrot head.)
i love how lizzie almost cussed and then she remembered that shes a family friendly youtube channel 🤣😂
Lizzie almost cursed when that bore attacked her
The intro never gets old
Lizzie: *gasp* "what the Ff- ... Blaze's is that"  Me:😲😂
Can we appreciate Lizzy's Minecraft skin like its some of her past lifes combine into one   every life she has is like  walled in her base and has its own little design
the name for Joel on the way stone was “joel hot and big” IM DYING
The little room she decorated represent her past origins
Lizzie I know why you did what you did in your crooks in the base all of your past lifes
Oh I get it.                                                      It’s all her past lives
As an Enigma (kinda) I’m glad MC’s enigma is so cool with many amazing abilities:) even if it has some inconveniences
I also love when she said:I can flap you flap she said it two times at 1:15 😂😂
I love when she said:I have ✨WIGS✨at 0:40
The decision  is her other lives
Are all the decor all your lives?
I love how this series is testing lizzie's survival skills and whether she can stay alive long enough
The decoration is based of her past origins
WHAT THE F .... uh What the blazer's😅
10:58 as she almost says wtf lol
I Understand the decorations they are all of her origin’s that she has been. We are smart Lizzie
I EASILY GOT THE SECRET DECORATIONS ITS HER PAST LIFES IM SO SMARRT😭😭
it should be a skill how lizzie can die so fast lol
My god- she died quickly
She lasted one episode good job Lizzie
The nooks are all her orgins that she’s had
What the f- blazes is that!
Anyone else hear the andermen say”no fwip”
gosh I saw how you died yet again when you just got it
I understand the decisions they are little memorials of ur past lives :0
lizzie.. why does the pansexual flag keep popping up in your designs? have something to tell us?
Your decorations represent your past origins if I'm correct
The little areas are based on her old houses and regions 👽🦜🦝🦘💐🌸
OK BUT IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABT HOW SHE ALMOST SWEARD?!?!?!? also quite surprise u died 2 times in a one vid😍
All your decorations resemble you old life’s and the houses that went with them ☺️
Your mini map shows where your secret has is
Oki I like hot her enigma skin has a bit of each of her old origins! (Raccoon, flora, kangaroo, alien, and parrot)
the engima is technically just the matrix and a demon.
It's in her house her floren <or however you spell it> life u think her parrot life maybe her raccon villager things for 2 but oh I just realized maybe the cow and the not is for the pranks she did this episode
i solved the mystery! You live inside a Pinata!!!
At the end she got a little evil 😂😂😂😂
anyone else realized that each part of lizzies enigma skin represents every origin she had before? yeah ok, just me?
What is the mod used in the end called
Ik what those nooks are! They are showing of all her past lifes
It’s rooms of her old life’s
Actually u can never beat the wither and wither skeletons  they cant be harmed because your stare has an effect that has a wither effects which makes them stronger and able to heal so it wont be good at them
Aren’t your little mysteries your last lives? Look like it.
Enigma sounded like Nico di Angelo from Percy Jackson
Oh please no more of that creepy piano noise in creeps me out.
Ya regret saying the over world is boring?
Girl how did you survive so long on one life
The mystery’s in your base is just how your other bases was
I love that she is posting more often now
I thinks every nook stands for a character
The secret place has all the past origins ( parrot, the floran, the red for the racoon house etc. )
The mysteries of ur base Lizzie is all ur origins
She's been hurt by the other players but this time she will fight back!
11:00 "what the f- blazes is that !" 🤣🤣
The spaces reprezents ich dead origen
The mysterious reasons are your old origins
I know the decoration is for every organ that she has transform in after life
Alternative Title: I can Fly for 2 minutes
Lizzie, it also said you can punch people to death as well *-*
Oh the secret decorations are the animals shes been
I like your video's and I think I know your mystery here Lizzie! Those small rooms resembles your past lifes
So are we just going to forget about when she said “what the f-“
Lizzie is now back in the small gang!  Edit: Was-  Edit 2: The “nooks” are themed around her past lives! (The nooks in her new base)
These videos are the legit definition of don’t let anyone know your next move.
How do you spell Lizzie's origin name
Really hate how lizzie almost swear at 10:58 10:59
When you try ur best but you dont sucseeeeeeeed🤣🤣🤣
I didn’t know Lizzie swears
I just love the parrot that’s my favorite one even though the raccoon was so adorable… and also like someone said she does have short life’s but she takes advantage of her powers
how is it possible to die so fast my god lizzie
I'm seeing a pattern with birb origins.
If you keep dying your gonna get kicked off the server!
Sorry I have to say this....., You look like a pansexual bird 🕊️🐦
Raccoon was the compost one. Bird was the bird head one. Flower was the Floren one. The goo was the alien one. And the cow head was the kangaroo one. I figured out your secret, the rooms are based on your past lives. I’ve watched this entire Sires so far so I know the secret 🤫
"Oh no! My only weakness! Being weak!"
The mysterious head quarters is all the ex life’s she’s had🤣

All of the secret things or decorations are Lizzie's past form
10:56 oooo lizzy almost said the f work🤭🤭
every one is for one of your past orgins
Has anyone noticed that the nobs are actually memories of her other lives?
all the nooks are her past lives
the different nooks are all of her past lives
LIZzie ur base isn't very secret cause u have a map and the other players can see it on ur Map
I think each of the little nooks Lizzie made a representing each life she had for example the one with the parrot head was when she was a bird
I hate to admit it, but at this point, she may as well do a livfe per episode
Omg! I’m finally smart! All the decor is her past lives!
ik what the knooks(?) mean. Hint: her prior origins.
10:57 WHAT THE FU- blazes is that?
I hope this life lasts long because she only has like 4 left!
NO YOU KILL MEH BIRB
10:57 lizzie almost swearing 😭
GUYS! The decor is based off of her origins from before!
lizzie sweared
Wait a minute- those decorations resemble  all the origins she was I think  🤔
I think I know those thing inside the wall are the stuff you have been it took me 2 seconds to think about that
I know they are
She simultaneously has the best and worse luck... Perhaps make a bunch of small, decoy houses so that no one will actually check behind the waterfall?
Ain't even 3 minutes and you are changing species again
ITS A FU- BLOODY PIG
I think the pockets are for all of her past life’s
I know what the mysterious decorations are There themed around her past origins
What the fu- (remembers that’s she’s a family channel) blazes was that
The decor is her past lives
birb is pan flag
Me waiting someone to realize that she was about to swear
“What the f- bLaZeS Is ThAt!”
Lizzi forgetting she’s a family friendly channel. “What the ffffffff…….blaze
Lizzie it was 2 minutes and you already lost your bird life🤣 I pray girl💖💖
Just saying my parents would still get mad a Lizzie for not looking at them when she is talking or there talking to Lizzie
Lizzie is in her riddler arc
What the F----Blazers!
lizie it is ovius those are your previus origins
She’s referring the nooks to her past lives.
Ohhhh the nooks you made are the after life's you had
Each off those nooks represent one of your past lives!
She made a nook for every power she has had
Can you please put a mod list in the description.
'What the Ffffff..... BLAZES is that' nice save lizzie
I am still cringing at how the game misspelled bird 💀
The decorations are all your past lives.
Lizzie u keep dying 😭😭
Lizzie : WHAT THE FU- … BLAZES Me : BAHAHHAHA
Having kingdom Craft deja vu rn 🥹
The mystery dugouts are all her past lives
Is the way of how you decorated your deths/lives?
before watching: i have a feeling that because she said "this seems unimportant" that she'd die by flying into a wall or something 20 seconds later: oh, i was sorta right 2 hearts was from hitting the wall or somn
Lizzie: my base is top secret! Lizzie: has a minimap in the top left corner with her exact coordinates for the entire video
STOP DYING
I understand the base, it means the old origins she was
LIZZE AALMOST CURSED DaMMMM
I UNDER STAND THE NOCKS AND KRANIES
I know what the nooks are for her old origins I think
I think the secret decorations are replicas of her old lifes.
I love the decorations being all of her past lives it’s actually a great idea
2:13 ahhh not again lol
The mysterious reason is her origins!!
No one gonna talk about how the enigma skin has the pan flag
NOOO MY ONE WEAKNESS.being weak :(
Birb.
U DULLY
I have a theory, what if the hacker that killed Lizzie in TrollCraft was the same person as Xornoth but on a different account. Think about i, if he got on one he could probably get on another time!
Aww... how many times you will dead but you are my favourite youtuber and that's true 💖💖
Riddler vibes
please go back to the end!
Lizzy did you kill Scoot?
Lizzie was having fun as a Birb until she died Lol
The decorations r ur previous lives
I like how you made the nooks your past lives! That was a cool idea! I love your videos!
U should get items that represent your old life
Omg-
Lizzie, you scared me with that voice at the end 0.0 KEEP DOING IT!
she spawned in a hole and she died in a hole
This is my first comment 🦄😇
it is your past live
RIP birb! Only had a minute to live. As a raccoon she said she can’t read but now she can…. Why did you kill SCOTT?!?
Hi! I love you
I recognise that pattern on your sock Lizzie. We have a lot in common, same nickname, same love for cats and well, that.
I love you video I am Georgiana you can call me G I am 8
Lizzie,it would be great if you do another reaction to fan edits! I’ve done 2 for you! Their not the best though. So if you wouldn’t mind doing another reactor to fan edits! That would be great! Thanks bye! (Also I love you vids! Your my favourite YouTuber! And don’t forget to keep doing you hard work!)
Lizzie please make the lowercase c (can) in the title uppercase it’s annoying me lol
For all of you wondering what those mini sections in her base were well there reminders of her past origin.The red and black was the raccoon with some trash,then a floral one with end stone, beehive and flowers,then the goolien with amethyst and crystal from the biome she made.Lastly,there was a colourful one with a parrot head which had the colours of the birb she was.Have a good day,night or evening to all of you!💗💗  Edit:Sorry there was a one with a boat and cow heads to represent the kangaroo
we can see in your mini map where your base is
the mysterious things.i realized that it was her past lives in the very beggining
Episode 9
her bird skin being tha pan flag colours- <333
No I already know the mysterious reason so first of all the colour wool is for your bird origin but then the other part looks like your old raccoon house and then you use the Slime blocks when you were in Alien so it's representing all your old Origins
sad you died I love your videos you make me very happy
Still waiting
Honestly i think the enigma origin suits you since you all ways play pranks and are always unpredictable
Ep9 please please please please 🥺
10:10 i think some of the sections in the walls are supposed to resemble her previous origins (pumkin with flowers: florian, lightning rod and amethyst: goolian, etc)
Is it just me or was the ending music very sinister?
It's all her old origins! as rooms🦝🦜💐🕳🦘👽
ldshadowlady you are great at everything me and my little brother love you and your content so much
Did anyone realise her skin represents each of her past origins, brown reindeer on foot birb on other foot body floran, back is raccoon
Ooooooouuuuuu a new video
SHE ALMOST SWEARED BAHAHA
Damn she almost swear- 💀
Damn she almost swear- 💀
oOoOO, Lauren AND Lizzy are villains?!.. things are bout to get real-
Why are there so many people who's names are free robux on my account? 💀 also, 7:28 IS THAT A PAN FLAG?!?!
Be the oxaloto
Lol ldshadowlady you almost swore XD
The little mystery nooks in her house are each decorated from he other origins!
10:58 my dear Lizzie you almost said it...... so close 👁👄👁💅
Umm I’m kinda worry for her she has 6 life’s only 😔
Each nook is an origin
i know why whats youre mistyries thats a  memrial the of the origins you played of
START A VILLAN ARC QUEEN!!!!
the nooks represent her Origins
lizzie, you need to stop dying so much. i'm pretty sure your on one of your last lives.
I feel like if you went in that tiny one block hole right behind the zombie then you could have lived you life as a birb- but you didnt so i should shut my mouth.
Grymm
Lizzie I found a song about after life The YouTube channel is called
I think that we all know that all the nooks are related to her past origins
Hi lizzie! I get a bit worried because you don't post as often as you used to so I hope everything is okay!
The “Mystery” was very easy it is just all of your past origins.
I know the mystery…
In your house you're using all of your past lives for your base I'm a genius
She finally sort of survived an episode! Good job! 😊🪴
Pan flag? 🤨📸 /j
wow a episode that lizzie doesn’t die in
Join the league of villains they will probably love your power
She was making those decorations for the origins she was in previous episodes
hey lizzie post a video on may 7th please because thats my 10th bday
I live you
they spelled it wrong it said BirB
You are a Scarlet Macon and Scarlett is my name
YOU KILLED SCOTT 😂😭
OH I KNOW WHY YOU WERE IN A CAVE! It was a desert and you were a kangaroo so you were there.
The series is just 😮‍💨
Can I have a shout out anyways your doing so nice love you
You should make a book with all your old origins and what you like about them and what you hate or don't like
9:51 the decorations are all her origins so far
u r amazing     but can u pls try not to die so much
8:33 is it behind the waterfall next to spwan?
SQUAK! LD WANTS A CRACKER
"Oh no! My one weakness! Being weak!" -Lizzie 2022
The nooks she made are you past lives
Your little birdie skin looks so cute on you
I don't know how Lizzie can cope with losing her personality that she cherished. How do you stay SO calm, Lizzie? Tell me!
"what the ff- ... -blazes"
I'm at 10:34 and I already know that you are gonna represent your lives as some creatures idk how to describe it but still! I am so clever!
It’s only been 8 minutes and lizzies already resorted to villainy. Love it
am I the only one who noticed that in both of her skins there was the pan flag colors in it? Also I love you lizzie!
The things in the nooks in Lizzie’s base are full of stuff that was based on her past lives, like for the florin there is honey because that’s all she could eat and there’s a pumpkin because she was in the end and wore a pumpkin, for the parrot she put the colors that were on her wings and she needs a parrot because- well she was one for the raccoon she put some trash and a compost bin. For the kangaroo she put a cactus and a boat because she pranked someone(forgot who) by putting boats everywhere and the Desert is her homeland and well, I think you get the idea
I think when you are a enigma,living underground is a good idea cause you won’t accidentally kill someone or something e.g. cute animals , friends , pets
love your vids
My Friend loves your vids
Hello
We want more vids please!🙃🥰
Poo
what the f- blazes is that?? she almost slipped up
I from Russia.
I really love your creativity with each origin you get but I am genuinely concerned that you'll have a short time on the server so please be more careful with you and your 5 lives left, love your vids lizzy!!
Wow she was having fun as a Birb and then she died Lol
10:56 WHAT LMAOO
How many lives do you have left Lizzie your so clumsy 🤣
We don’t know where Lizzie lives but I know it is in Katherine’s first episode she says "there is the stone and a strange waterfall” sorry I really am a spoiler 🫣😂
I figured you out each nook is for each origin you had.
Lizzy can you reactive to the afterlife song please🥺🥺
I'm kind of scared of lizzy now she cut a birds head off to put on display 😨..
Bruh I'm raging BC u die
Wait,Your skin actually represents all of your past origins!
Lizzie dident you notice in your “seacret” headquarters you still have your mini map open
Lizzie can you build a shop at the spawn a food shop!!
You are🦥
I like how every  orgin lasts 3 or 1 episodes
In thos nooks Lizzie made are all the orgins she has been/roles
It said birb when she was reading about 🐦
The secret little different colors carved things she was talking about was her all orgin's
she put her past lives in the room
Ah, I wanted to see Lizzie ride Joel. Lol
fun fact if you stare at an enderman without looking away the enderman will never move so if you just stare at it you can hit the enderman no problem
You killed Scott how could you
Your secret decorations are your past origins
she almost said it Lol
Joel died on Episode 8 *Twice*     Me: Coincidence? I think not     I know what the room is it's your *Past* Origins If you dunno what the cow and boat means it's Goolien Lizzie  =]
LDShadowLady, do you remember Yamimash? The youtuber that you played with in 2013, he was known to make Markiplier collabs.
Lesson learned never go to pretty bioms
Excuse you you are a bird not bird
Also you guys can maybe do sponsors but I don’t know what they are just a suggestion. Also can I be in one of your shout outs? I want to be your number one fan!😀
Shadow lady I was at school and we were coding things and then I saw you in one of the Minecraft ones and I was so happy
I just freaking got the idea when I rewatched this 5 times, the decorations are for every one of her origins
Lizzes secret base has all her origins in it <3
I recently started YouTube and I am very new I would be so happy if u subbed
Omg your vids are truly the most awesome thang
All the mystery little decorations are based off of her roles
Oh I get it!!! The rooms represent the origins you have!!! Btw if she already said that sorry but its such a cool idea!!
I think Lizzie is just slowing going insane at this point
she is getting scary...
Bisexual Bird? (because of the colors?)
"what the f.... blazes is that" 🤣
I- Lizzies bird is pansexual coloured lol
Lizzie should be more careful she only has 5 lives left and yes I’ve been counting-
All those rooms are her origin she used to have I'm pretty sure(spoiler for rooms)
Does she not know you can find it through the mini map
i havent watched you in ages omg 😭😭😭
The enigma would be perfect for the recent trend on tik tok🤚🏼
The map is on the corner so you should hide that
Since you're an enigma I think it would be cute if you lived in a cute black glass block ghost! then if you want you could move your stuff in it!
The mystery she based all the nooks as her ogrins
The decor of her home is all of her origins!
Poor Lizzie someone protect her
I luv u lizzie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10:56 did lizzie just curse??!!?!
Let’s ignore how Lizzie nearly said fuck :D
she was actually scary....she creeped me out lol
Yeeees
Her old origins
I love you so much
Why are you not posting videos?🥺
MOTHER LOOK ITS A BIRDID
It was so funny at the start
She is making her past origins
I really hope that Enigma Lizzie will survive for at least 3 episodes, that would be amazing!
I think we all wish this was real! Or is it just me who wants to be a bird woman ?
An enigma's worst enemy: The pigs.
The secret base honestly looks like something Joel would make
The little nooks are your past livesssssss
Is that the FASTEST DEATH ever in ASMP? lol
She’s making the decorations her past lives I’m so smart! :]
I love how Lizzy used stuff to decorate her house to show what she was
Lizzy you should join Lauren and Scott to be evil with them
SHELBYS CAFE IS NEXT TO THE WATERFALL
A waterfall in a ukown location that happens to be next to Shelby’s cafe
R.i.p Bird 😭waaaa
We all know you killed scott
Lizzies base is made out of all of her old origins. There’s the raccoon house, the end floran, the goolien, the kangaroo, and she needed the parrot because she was making her parrot origin
Lizzy you should have asked astron to be the kathryn lupita flower girl and empires smp because she has lots of flowers🌹✨
The nooks were her previous deaths
I wish I could see you in reel life
Why did you kill scott?
Why did you kill scott
Why did you kill scott
I know what it means its alll of the things before like yhe goolian bird racoon
Pls atleast have up to ep 50
Lives are slow Lizzies lives go faster  Than ✨liGhtInG✨   Tho
I just noticed lizzies skin like represents all her life so far raccoon, floran, gulian, kangaroo, birb and enigma.
THIS IS SUCH A GOOD ORIGIN. Please keep it for more than 2 episodes
I miss empires, a season two needs too happen!
the series has only 10 lives- and lizzie is dying alot o.o is it me or is lizzie gonna get kicked early o.o
Died literally 2 times on one episode almost
Bro she almost said wtf-
The mystery of the decoration is that they are all her previous lives
I love you so much LDShadowLady
10 seconds into the vid she died 😭
Her house in the nooks is all of her past lives!
does anyone else just get overly excited when lizzie uploads? whenever she posts its all i look forward to!! I especially love this new minecraft series! How many deaths are we at???😄
This took the death stare onto another level 😂
Her skin = all her origns Her rooms = based on each orign she has had
Enigma seems like weird core. I like it.
Lizzie, is this the start of your villian arc? We all know you killed him.. No hiding it!
i just relised that lizzie's skin has a pan flag on her leg is she pansexual??
I have never played minecraft in my life....... Am I missing out? If you read this send me a dm and we can make my first Minecraft video :)
Lizzie each one of your nooks resembles your previous life the cow heads and the library are the ones that you had when you were a racoon, the end flowers with the bee hive resemble the time when you were an end Florian, the goo and amethyst was from your goolien life and the colourful wool resemble your birb life and the red walls and deepslate trim and the composter was from your first life when you were a racoon and the composter somewhat resembles the rubbish that you collected
Wait how is Lizzy a live she died 5 times
See if Lizzie doesn't die this episode
I Think U went a bit too far at the end XD
I love ur vid and me and my BFF text every time u post I texted her you died in the first two minutes she said typical Lizzie also you are my favorite YouTuber!
I think the areas in the base are to represent sll her past lifes lol
I understand the decor its from you're .... .... No spoilers haha
Have you watched Heartstopper?
Yo Liz you should make a base to be safe from dying!
At 10:4 the that thing was easy that was her origin in her past and the library was the first villager🤗 for me it was pretty obvious🤗
The room is based on her past lives
I think the little spaces in her home represent each of her origins 😀
I took me 2 weeks to realize that your skin when u where Floran was same as from xlife when u killed ( I forgot hes name ) in ep 21.💐🙂
hi Ldshadowlady!!!since you died so many time why don't you kill other people i mean your origin is kinda easy to kill  people. o and I'm on my brother account sorry
Why did you put all your past live in your secret home
The bird area looks like a pride flag lol
If looks could kill….
I figured the secret the base has something to do with the orgins.
Each of the nooks represent a life!
FINALLY SHE SURVIVED ITS A MIRACLE
Lizzie ur hiding in Scotts water fall
BROOOOO
Since you're an enigma I had an idea that you could live in a ghost made in black stained glass then if you want you can move your stuff in it
each decoration is a origin you had
Please make more awesome vids like these Lizzie♥️
The nooks are each of her origins; Racoon, end floran, alien, kangaroo, and parrot
Pls don't die I cannot live with you dying and ending this series quickly, I hope you don't die!, May you have best of luck
The bird colors are pansexual
are all these free robux channels bots or something bc they all seem pretty human
im at 10:34im guessing all of those things were her lives that she died as? bc she needed a bird?
i swear i was expecting her to die in 2 minutes
Hi
Lizzy u should join the villains club
Did you kill Scott
ITS LIZZIES ORIGINS THE NOOKS ARE ALL HER ORIGINS  1 the one with the cow head and boat is the KANGAROO  2 the one with the slime is the GOOLIAN 3 the one with sticks and barrels is the RACOON 4 the rambow one is the parrot BIRB 5 the bee hive with the pumpkin was the END FLORIN AND HER BACE IS BEHIND THE WARTERFALL AT SPAWN
"what the fpffffttttptt... blazes is that"
Anyone who has seen S majors latest episode knows exactly where this is lol
The nooks are your old lives
you keep dying because you don't want to do this
“What the fu-….. blazers is that??”
dieing right off the bat is always fun
You die too much
2:16 uhmmm
Each one of the decorations are what you where in your past life
Love your videos Lizzie keep it up
for anyone wondering the mysterious decorations are small versions of every origin lizzie has had :3
Bludey hell!  This was Amazing!
“Where the mistirey continues..” GIRL U GONNA DIE NEXT EPISODE U LITERALLY DIE EVERY EPISODE
“What the ffffff BLAZES is that?!”
This girl has died 7 times
Finally she diddnt die as an enigma
You're waterfall has been found. WHY did you do it to scooter boi
Afterlife smp. The smp where ldshadowlady somehow manages to die every episode.
You killed scott
There some parts of your last life isn't it?
OMG
I know what you’re doing you’re doing all your life that you were
OMG Lizzie died again!!!
I was about to be like “Lizzie didn’t die for once” but then I remembered she did as a bird in the begenong
just came to the comments to say... "what the ffffff- BLAZES IS THAT?!?!"
SHES A PAN BIRD 😍😍😍💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅
I think those "decorations" she built on her base were kind of representations of her past lives
Me and my friend always watch you and when I saw you posted I texted her and I said she died with in two mins she said typical Lizzie lol I love ur vids so much you are my fav YouTuber so sub everyone!
your new house the rooms there were your last lifes
Lizzy when I was playing Minecraft I just was by a river and then a Melody just happened and it sounded very and peace going to the river underground that has doesn't really have so much roof on it and try to be patient that's what I did
The nooks are her past origans
There here last origins du
Did you kill Scott
*next episode* hello guys I have got a new orgin
So May Robux adds! What the heck?
Dose anyone else think that Lizzie has gone insane!🤔
noo lizzie
I just realize! Those mysterious room things represent the different origin she had
Uuu I no dat is your lava an u 😎😎😎😎
I really think lizzie is going to completely die in maybe two more episodes with how fast she’s dying 😂  Oh and also I think I figured out what those little rooms in the walls are, I think thay are themed after every life you have had and I found that out when you said you needed a parrot it’s Bc you where just a parrot and died so you where adding that death to the rest.
Are the nooks based of the lives she had. The bird and the red one looks like the spirited away house, ect
she should try to kill scott .Scott told Lauren to kill her
honestly love this series
Now every time you get a new origin, I am more scared than excited about how long you'll last this time 🤣
Lizzie quick question☺ when are u ganna upload?😊
nobody gonna talk about how lizzie almost said the f word LOL
What about bows???
poor lizzie got killed by a barracuda 😭 i think she’s gonna keep dying every episode 🫣
The little rooms are your orgins that  you died in
i think your making the little nooks in your secret base what origins you've already been
LIZZIE!? YOU KILLED SCOTT?!
8i think bc you've made bases all around the map you should  make a mine cart ride to connect them
im so sad she didnt post anything yesterday because it was my birthday but rewatching these is pretty good
10:58 this women did everything in her power *not* to swear 😭
All the spaces represents Lizzie’s origins!
Y’know it’s not a lizzie episode without her dying
I feel like this is the start of lizzie's evil arc.     *oh no*
Maybe why you spawned in a desert is because kangaroos spawn in the dessert and you were a kangaroo so maybe the game glitched and made you spawn in the desert instead of spawn (?)
Scott is a mob
Those special areas are for ur previous lives
Did you kill Scott in his new video????????????????????????????????? Cuz there's a video referred to you killing Scott and i kind of agree
You are not very mysterious, but the episode was great! Can't wait for more mystery.
the decorations are from your origins that's so cute !!
Lizze Scott's gonna take revenge on u u better be prepared when u were a kangaroo thats why
i think i solved it its your past lifes? idk
Lol did u just kill scott
I think that Lizzie is meant to die at the cave when she was a birb, because at the start of the video she spawned at a cave and a few moments she died at a cave too. Btw love your vids I always support you and I always watch your vids!!💕♥️
anyone else think lizzie is dying way too quickly. Honestly it's like watching scar on hermitcraft
The only thing I see with the colors of the birb is the pan flag. Does anyone else see that or am I strange?
Lizzie Really Said “Don't let Them Know Your Next  Moves"
i know all of the nooks
Finally an origin where Lizzy doesn't die C: :D
"I came out of the world just as I came into it.... in a hole"
What hurts me so much is when you die is you have to abandon your builds because it might not fit you Origins Aesthetics + You also have to abandon your other projects with others for examples The Little Club that Lizzie was a member of now she cant join. Because her new origin might not fit the requirement of those projects.
Join the evil side Lizzy 😈😈
Join the evil side Lizzy 😈😈
AT 10:57 SHE ALMOST SAID THE F WORD OMG
It is all your orgins!
All the decorations in your secret bast is of your pass lifes lol kinda said you couldn't be a bired for long would of loved to see what you would build for that origin
welp liz is finally insane :T the killing has got to her
She hasn’t died in this origin yet which I good and I hope she doesn’t die soon
The mystery of your new house is that each part represents your houses/origins through the series.
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I love how the title is “I CAN FLY!” While two minutes in th video she dies and gets a new Origin
Why does the “you thought you could escape me… but you were wrooong” at 12:36 sound to creepy 😅  *Spoiler warning*       I’m so excited to see more of this origin! Short lived or not, she’s already killed Scott (I think, from his video) and I love the transition from annoying kangaroo, to cute birb, to villain enigma.
what she did is a really good way to kill ender man
I love how she finally ended a episode without death
10:57 what the fu- I MEAN BLAZES IS THAT
Dam it’s been 4 years sens I’ve seen your vids wow…
Omg the bunker represents all the origins she’s ever been 🥰 that’s so cool (I think) 😂
Oh my goodness lizzie LMAO so many deaths😭😭
The “mysterious decorations” are literally just Lizzie’s past origins, and so as her skin im pretty sure Tbh I rlly like the idea of that ^^
Lizzie I love you, but you are impressively fragile this SMP... almost as if you are doing it on purpose... oh no... have I fallen for the enigma trap?!
Okay, but doesn't ,"My one weakness! Being weak!" sound like a quote?!?!
Her secret base has all of her origin as an deco.
the nooks are for alll the origins lizzie has had so far. Racoon, flower person, kangaroo, bird, and enigma
Lizzie you have to join the villain club!
Awesome adventures, can't get enough! I really enjoyed watching and coming back again for more. 🙏

As an idea for  your new origin u should start collecting totem of undyings! You should get revenge in Lauren
is the decorations based on ur previous origins?
SHE KILLED SCOTT
Me: Awhhh parrot! Me now: ahh… dead bird.
Is this counted as a LdSHADOWlady?
Lizzie since you are evil/mysterious, you should put traps and secrets around the server! And everyone needs to find out who it is, so in your next episode if you do it, don't tell it on your channel just secretly do it and play along, so your viewers need to find out who it is so the whole fandom will be excited.
Once I saw the first area I knew it was replicated off all the origins Lizzie had
Lizzie:I can fly!  2 seconds later:*is dead*
LIZZY STOP DYINGGGGG PLZZZZZZZZZ
Each quarter shows her each orgin
“What the f… blazes” -Ldshadowlady
Evil lol
lizzie did you kìll smajor?
Love your videos!!!!
Not being mean but lol you died not being mean
OMG can I please have a shot out please I know you don't do them but please!!!!!!! Please 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 no one does please
ENIIGMA IS OP!
Your so suspicious
all of your mysterious decorations are all of your origins right?
Ldshadowlaydy is a lengendary Player in Minecraft 😮😮🎉
Some of the decorations are like symbols of her old houses, you can see that the red one has like the same design as her first house and another one has a bunch of flowers and a pumpkin representing her house in the end and or every origin she has had
LIZZIE WEAR A BUNNY MASKED SKIN PLEASE IT WILL GIVE ME AND MY FRIEND TRAMUA AS THE EGIMA
omg at 10:57 lizzie almost cursed.......
welp lizzie has kept her trend of dieing at least once every episode
CONGRADULATIONS LIZZIE!  For the first time in like, a month, your origin survived to go to the next episode! 🥳🥳🥳🥳
When lizzie was like what the f### I was Lizzie Lizzie don’t say it Lizzie: blazers is that: me : few
I understood immediately what the little decorations were they were like all decorations of like her origins and like things that
Lizzy I really don't know how are u keep dieing 😢
LD how tf you get youtube to comment on ur vid 😭
Lizzie in Scotts video he walked passed your waterfall entrance and then I think you killed him
“What the fff- blazes is that?”- Lizzie
Did you stare Scott to death?
Lizzie... You NEED AMOR!! 1st: FRIST THING YOU SHOULD DO GET WOOD. 2nd: MAKE TOOLS AND THEN GET STONE. 3rd: FIND AMOR AND THEN U WON'T DIE ANYMOREEE-  Play as if you were doing a normal Minecraft world
Joel 🤝 Lizzie Dying right after getting their origin
the rooms in the base are her other life's she was a bird then she needs a bird
"What the fff– blazes is that!" 😆😆😆
its her past origins
Lizzie i think u can still use bows & tridents & pickaxes to fight
Guys shhh I’m here to tell you a secret each little space was from  a past origin shhh 🤫
Fav color is orange so when she used it I was so happy. STAY ALIVE LIZ U GOT THIS
The mystery is all the origins that you where
That hast to be the Fastest death in afterlife  SMP history.
Cool
Hi lizzie love ur channel I watch all ur videos just wondering in the next episode can you build  a cool new house inspired by you origin and pls make a statu of merry  and buddy guarding the front of your house. (Please do some thing inspired by my comment I think it would be a cool build to put in ur vidio) I hope u like my Idia thank you for entertaining us all love ur channel good luck in the series  (from lillie)
The nook's are based of her origins
im pretty sure that the nooks in the secret base are all of lizzies past origins
the birb died :(
sashiburi! been a while! nice to have you back x
Lizzie I Think You, Stared Scott, To Death
y should build a hobbit hole to blend in
I just watched  smajors new video and LIZZIE WHAT DID YOU DO!!!!😧😰😱
nooo YOU JUST GOT YOUR BID POWERS
I feel so bad for her like WHY MUST SHE SUFFER!!!
I love the ✨Mysterious✨ details in your new enigma base! The components of your skin are also suspiciously familiar, thought I can’t quite place why… 🤔🤔🤔
Lizzie I really want some more empires episodes
The nooks are her old lifes
The yt Wikipedia said “Is LDShadowLady married 2019? Lizzie is currently married to fellow YouTuber SmallishBeans, aka Joel. She married him on May 11, 2019.” I think it’s false but is it true or not?
Lizzie why do always die so easily I really like the animals you are but you keep dying
BTW Lizzie we can see your location in the map in the corner ….
Lizzie I think I just found yo ur base in Scott’s video. 😭✋🏻 I instantly recognized it because you hinted it was a secret waterfall- I think that might have been a mistake? I dunno but I hope not many people find out until you or another member of afterlife finds it- so that it keeps the mystery.✨
I figured out the nooks decoration inspiration! It’s all of her past lives in which the red and black one resembles her raccoon base/house! The pink, blue, and yellow represents her birb/bird life!
I know what the nooks stand for it's all of her lives
LIZZIE U KILLED SCOTT
I think the secret base means all the lives Lizzie has had
👎💩
I'm tricked.
I-
I know what that’s holes are it’s every single mom she’s ever been in the game started with her first the red one with the leaf
The birb origin was so cute to bad you died :(
So cool video 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
i think the decor in ur base r based on the ur origins or the way you died... or atleast a creative guess or basically everyone could tell.......
I hope you cab become gojo girl version
Anyone notice the decorations in her base are all representing her past lives
sosksmos
sksosks
All the nooks in ur base r ur previous lives!!!
Lizzie I figured the mystery to the wall! Its all of your origins!
The "mysterious" nooks are soo cute!
Love ur new orgin lizzie shubble was a birb too but she also died right after like u
Please make more
I like how her "mysterious decorations" are stuff and/or is related to her previous homes
The decoratons are all of her origins!
Ldshadowlady Just said what the fuck
I love your origin so much!
lizzie now as a bird be like: i conclude that im very smol
her: what the fu-..... bLaZiNg
I figured it out it's her previous origins
All of the nooks are you past afterlifes
Lizze needs to be careful with her lives, i don't want her to be out series
Each little room in the base is each thing Liz turned into and maybe how she died idk but.....
omg it's her villainess era purrrr
SHE GETS ALL THE CUTE ONES 😍😍😍
Almost day 10. Who remembers?
The map lizzy the map
5 live left Lizzie.
Hi
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.   (1 John 1:8) - Repent. Jesus is coming soon.
This is one of the first episodes we’re Lizzie doesn’t die in the hole episode
SONUNDA
She's making rooms about every single life she has. That's why she needed a bird for her colorful display.
Hi lizzie Iove the disney princess challage you did  and I was wandering if you could keep doing it
Lizzie's Lives: The colorful birb: Ep:8~8 Cause of  Death: Zombies are not nice The Enigma: Ep:8~? (We won't know when she died and how she died)
Lizzie: What the-…. [Lizzie your a family friendly channel DONT say it] … Roses! Is that-
Lizzie join lauran in team evil and free scot from the shackles of goodness
Each decoration is for all the lives that you have had
the tiny edges in the wall are her past origins
Is no one ganna talk how lizzie almost cussed by saying "what f-....blazers is that"
Lizzie made the nooks reference to old homes
Join Lauran in the villain club The 2 of you can be evil together
You would be great for the villains club! If you don’t die so easily
I know what the little rooms are there were lizzys past orgin
Me : what the *swears  every way possible* is that??!??! Her : what the fffffffff- Blaze is that! XD
The nooks are all of her lifes
The corners of your new base are your before origins i have no idea if sombody else commented this
Lizzie shold join lorenz evil club
Cool now wheres the Stitch shrine
10:00 i think the decore for this part is for the memory of the lifes she's lived
The noticed lizzy base had all of her orgins thats why she needed a bird 😃
I love your videos everytime I see you're videos I feel happy im9
birb lizzie is bootiful :o
10:58 OOOOO LIZZYYY ALMOST CURSED
Episode 9😡
make a Ep.9 plssss 🥺🥺
It's obviose all those indents in the wall represent her origins
Hehehe you died after 2 minutes
The little nooks represent her past animal life’s 😁
Y u always die😭😭😭
You die every episode 😂
i found out the decorations for lizzies base are past origins!
I get it Lizzy the decorations
i think she is going a bit crazy :}~
No because the pride I hade in myself when I figured out exactly what she was making those nooks into after the first one.
she always changes origins like it’s on purpose it’s kinda annoying
Idea!: Make a normal looking house outside of the waterfall so it’s not too suspicious. Then it will look like you made the waterfall for decoration
Lizzie. They can find ur base on the mini map.
I think those decorations are about her past origins🤔
WHY DID I NOT GET THE NOTIF YT
Lizzie get revenge on lauren (by killing her) and maybe get on the Evil team with lauren i thoght scott was still on the evil team
TEAM UP WITH SCOT!
I was to early to say that
Lizzie shubble has a birb house you should go there! She built it when she was a birb
Did Anyone realise she has a pansexual them as a bird and then has the flag on her leg. I’m suspicious
Go to your end house I think it is beautiful
How many times did she die already??
LIZ YOUR MINI MAP IT STILL ON.
Each Nook is for every former origin you have had, am I correct? Also love the new Origin
Lizzie does almost every episode I loved the goolian
why do die so much!
Every afterlife video Lizzie makes first she gets her new thing and then goes to find a cute place to live And then dies end of video and then this video
hey lizzie can you watch my latest vid
Hi
Hello
It all your past life’s
I'm just wondering if she is going to keep her origin for more than two episodes.
If only shubble and you didn’t die! Then there would be two birbs, make a little evil or good duo, woulda been so CUTE!
I love this episodes!
Her: what the f Me: deffenitly she wanned to say what the fuck My sister: she says what the rainbow
Lizzie you should join the Villian Club!
Lizzie you need to be careful
Ahh you post on my birthday !!!!!😍
its not that hard he wall partsare all your lives thats you had
Each nook is for one of her old origins my guess is maybe she’s gonna attempt to combine them to become powerful I’m not sure though
Let's hope this live lives longer
I love how it's only been 1 month of origins smp and lizzie has died 6 times already
SHE FINALLY BECAME THE VILLAIN, YESSSSS
verry  nice i know what thees decerations mean it means all the lives you died in
The nooks are your old homes 😏
Rub it in Lawrence face that you can fly
Imagine this being a 2 minute video
Gurlll why you dying soo mucchhhhh
Her decorations is her past lifes ez
Why is that music so sinister and evil
I like how everyone is basically sticking to one animal and Lizzie is like nope every episode I’m a new animal
You can only die 3 more times I’m very scared
Omg
Today on “how is Lizzie going to lose her Origin the moment she gets it?”
I think Lizzie's secret areas are all of her orgins
I like it how those displays each origin that she played in her mysterious secret area
girl your going to be the first one to die lol i love these vids so much  i notifications on and have subed love this channel <3 btw i got bingo on ur other channel i like of things u like to bad i dont have cat tho :p
10:57 lizzie trying not to cuss absolutely killed me
Those decorations are like the old origins of ldshadowlady? :')
katie i never know is a secret 😳
I love how she displays all of her origins❤❤❤
What the f- .. blaze!
Love how she looks at her powers and beside bird is a piece of raw 𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙣
The fact that she just revealed her secret base at 10:29
That bird kinda looks like a pan flag :o
She filled the nooks with all of her past lifes
These videos are so good, I love then!!!
Hi
Ldshadowlady more like Ldfetherlady
I think those little room things where dedicated to all her lives
I'm pretty sure when she was running as her origin that she finally can last a few episodes with she almost said the f word I think idk idc also tho
This is before watching! PLEASE KEEP THE ENOGMA ORGIN FOR FOREVERRRR
I love the bird skin I don't think she was going for it but it looks like the pansexual pride flag and I love it
Now it is evil LDShadowLady hehehe....
Im not trynna be rude but WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DIE EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.
Oh no! My one weakness! Being wEaK
All of the nooks are all her previous origins
???
Finally she lives for an entire episode😭
I bet each one is one of her lives!
☺ Omg I am a fan omg!!!!☺ ☺and please please please spoert 🇺🇦 they are in danthger please help them☺
Did anybody notice that instead of bird the origin it’s called birb
Each side is all her past lifes
At spawn isn't it? Idk honestly. The mountain scream's "spawn" to me
“Oh no my one weakness, BEING WEAK!😂😂😂 -for Lizzie I’m a big fan!
i think each corner (section) of the room represents her past lives (origins)
I think I know why you spawned in a cave in the desert!!!!!!!!  I think it was a glitch from when you’re a kangaroo since you know it said that you would spawn in the desert so there is why I think you spoke to the cave in the desert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YAY IM ON A ADD BUT IM ABT TO WTACH IT! LOL ANYWAY I LOVE UR CONTENT!
I love that she made the decorations inspired by her past homes!
Oh come on u already died like 10 times I feel like u aren't even trying anymore
She is on the streak of being killee
Death count: 6
Others on afterlife: I AM EVIL!!!! FEAR ME!!  Lizzy: You have no idea what's even possible.😈😈
I know why you made all the colors are about it's all or your orgens the colors of what they are.
Boar: Atak Lizzie: WHAT THE FFFF BLASES
✧  the eclectic enigma ✧
I get ze mystery:> I am a genius:]
Not Lizzie dying in the first 2 mins
How many lives dose she have left ? Lizzi I’m scared for you , you have died many times …..
ddint she take her house down? the raccoon one?
Sigh. If only Scott hadn’t died. You guys would’ve made great bad guys. Duh. Do du do do (bad guys the song) oh well. You might wanna seek Lauren and the other bad guys. I think she’s still evil...
4th time watching and im still in shock that she died in a 2 minute time span. I honestly thought it would be the end of the video :P
Omg, I’m a “problem solving genius”! The nooks are her past life’s!
The nooks are each of your past origins!
The "mysterious nooks" are all the other origins she has played with.
oh never mind.🤐🤐🥺😳
I uncovered her mystery and it's all her origins😶
Birds eat moths you can scare scott and make yourself rich. :)
Also love your work
Hi Lizzie I love your videos and I’m going to build you something on my Minecraft and I want you to see it I don’t want you to not see this and I really hope you reply or at least do something to my comment to let me know you saw this again I love you BYEEEEEEE
I can already tell she not going to get past to 10th episode
the nooks are your past origons.....
I realized that both of her avatar's in this video have the pansexual flag 😻
I love her skin! So cute!
😭is every lil room a time she got a new power 🫶🏽 I love it
The decoration is all of ur old origins
I think the decorations are her past life's like the honey one it was when she was the flower girl and she had to eat honey to be able to stay alive because she didn't have sun in the end and the bird one is for her previous past life          I think that's it idk
The diffrent nooks represents her diffrent life's, that's why she needed the parrot to represent her once parrot life 🦜
Rambo’s quacking in his boots right now
hi
Let’s talk about each area is the different life or power she has gone through
so pretty orange is my fave color!
Hmm I wonder what she wants nooks of every life she has been in her house... I wonder...
8:33 plot twist the others are watching
Lizzie we all heard u 😀✋ 10:58
she died at 2:13
It's sad that she didn't get to Ride other players
Is she said she has 6Lives Left So if she keeps dying all the time in Afterlife She's gonna loose all her lifes
Yay! She didn’t die this episode!…besides the parrot origin… we shall not speak of…
omgg
The sad fact is when Lizzie died, she spawned where she tried to go🥹
Maybe less exploring? Or ask Scott how he survived for so long as a villain.
so the rooms in her new house is repsention of her lives
I love how she was going insane at the end lol
LIZZY. MAKE. A. MYSTERY. CLUB. ONLY. THE. PEOPLE. YOU. INVITE. CAN. ONLY. KNOW. THE. MYSTERY. CLUB. GOALS.
It looks like she finally went crazy.
Did anyone notice that her skin kinda looks like saiki k ??
If you’re deaf school I know I know
PESKY BIRD!
Lizzie's lives are getting shorter and shorter every episode like damn.
IK WHAT THE DECORATIONS MEAN ITS ALL THE ORGINS SHES EVER BEEN!
How do you do that when I download mods I can’t even do anything with it you’re really good at Minecraft because I am home we played for two years
I know what the Decor plan is she is making areas of her new home that reference her past origins
Lizzy ur my fav YouTuber
The nooks are past lives- (I think)
NOOOOOO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE!!!!
Lizzie this a gess but is it all your origins  pls tell us in the next video if it's right pls thx lizzie byeeee
I love how Lizzie almost died and she almost said you know what but instead she says Blazes.
The nooks are her old origins
FREE ROBUX BOTS ARE TAKING OVER OML
You have to stop dying you have 5 lives left
DO NOT DIE 5 MORE  TIMES OK NOT I LIKE IS OR NOT DIE FOR REAL
The titile            I can Fly! 🦜  what the title should be called:                I can Die! 💀
2:21 WHY
I scrolled through the comments a little and didn’t see anyone else comment this but the decorations in her house are each based on the origins she’s had so far!
The fact lizzie died 3 minutes in
Each nook is representing her origins!
I know what it is the nooks are for each origin she was after she died!
I know your bases pockets secret 🦝🌸 goolien 🦘 🐥 then when you end up dying again you will go back to your secret base and make another pocket to put your old origin in that pocket.
are you fluent in french yet lol
LIZZIE YOU ARE THE PAN FLAG
If she dies again- 🥲
Its the orgins you used to be
LIZZIE THERES A MINI MAP WHILE YOURE IN THE SECRET BASE
LIZZIE STOP DYING
I love ldshadowlady origin. They are so cute and cool . I love everyone origin in this serie. But lizze gets the best origin. Yes if you are reading this i am saying origin alot. But you are the best lizze😍😍
lizzie in her joker era
Hi
i think since the origin before ur engma origin was a bird u should make ur skin the bird skin but like still see through so its like ur a dead bird spirate i think that could be cool
hi LDShadowLady i wanted to ask you wich shaders you using bcs is beautiful and i need it. Pls answer and set link of shader :)
I think the nooks are based on all her lives she had
Anyone notice how when she was reading her new ability’s as a bird at the top it said “birB” and not bird strange!
EDGY LIZZIE CONFIRMED
The nooks resemble her past lives ♥
Shadow Lady No
This time Lizzie bird for less than 3 min.
OHHH MY GOSHSHSHHSDH
I love ur vids ❤️
Anyone else notice all the pansexual flags in this video, or just me ? Like the skins?
I love how Lizzie themed the decorations based on her past lives! 🥰
10:27- Idk if others realized this at this moment, but the 'decorations' are examples signifying her past lives. Also, Lizzie- love the content, keep it up!
2 minutes in and u already died wat da flying mash patatoe!!!!!!!😮😮😮😮😮😟
Or a zombie why am I thinking of these why was saying these weird things
Wait what is somebody's origin is a dragon??
Everytime she puts SOOOOOO MUCH effort in to her home and builds ( especially the end florist and alien one ) it upsets me when she dies and loses all of her hard work 😩😩😭😭
So Lizzie has become a psychopath... Wonderful.
The nooks are just your old lives
NOT gonna lie or be rude but I think ldshadowlady will be the first one to achieve all 10 lives and be banished from the sever
I love how you made shrines of your past origins
“What the fffff-blazers is that “😂😂
Oooh is every decoration what she was her past life’s
We have the same b day
isnt the base based on your past origins?
In my opinion I think Ldshadowlady is great and I hope that she sees this and knows she's amazing
I can't believe u said bird not birb I'm so mad like omg how dare u 😡😡😡😡😡😡😤😤😤😤😤😤
the underground base reminds me of her kingdom craft or crazy craft base
I wonder the little holes could never be bits of the past lifes
Omg all the mystery things in your wall are your past even the pranks?!?!
you a bird : I CAN FY!!!! me a human : ugh I can't fly :(
I think your decorating some sort of shrine for your past origins in your secret base but it’s just a guess
NOOOOOOOOOO
AWA UR SO SMOL AND CUTE I HOPE U DONT DIE
EEEEEEEEEK YOUR A PARROT 🦜
The rooms are all her orgins
can you do another 100 days in Minecraft vanilla
i saw the goo block thing and amethyst crystals and i was thinking you were making sections of all your origins you have gone through? would i be correct or mistakened? also awesome vid!
PLS DONT BE THE FIRST ONE TO LEAVE YOUVE DIED SO MUCH
I'm literally such a big fan of you in general, live your videos, and this series is one of my favs of yours! I love the vibe of it, and the change of personality and outfit depending on your origin is just amazing! Its kind of sad that you have about 5 lives left (counting that its just episode 8), but its still plenty to do stuff with! And you are right. I cant understand what those decorations and style of your house are! Perhaps its because I'm not an enigma?
You build that thing as a temple for you old lives
i love your vids 😄😄😄
The fact that see Dodge two times and I'm getting bored also
its a bird its a plane wait where did i go down a hole with a zombie where did it go well we will never know its dead
Lizzie in her new base: The location of which shall remain a mystery. Map in the corner: *oop*
I love how she was a bird for like two minutes
In her secret base the sections are her old origins.
Hey Lizzie i litterally love your vids and i think u and joel r so cute together :))))
Ah yes “what the ....Blazes “ nice save Lizzie ❤😂
YOUTUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!
I love the pansexual sock!!!
In the 15 is my birthday🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂
😈Try using Death Gaze on player 😈
The secret base honestly looks like something Joel would make
what the f- blazers is that?
You should join the leage of villans it fits your new  origin "Enigma"!!!!
I think I figured out lizzie's house. So basically all the things represent her past Origins so like the red one represented the raccoon because it looked like her house when she was a raccoon, the beehive and jack-o-lantern represent her life as a floran because she opened a shop in the nether and gave people free pumpkins for safety and one with the parrot represents her life as a parrot
OH NO MY ONE WEAKNESS BEING WEAK!
those are alltheorigins you had?
What the f-
I Love Your Videos You Made Me Smile ♥️
I feel like she keeps dieing on purpose. Like she could be more safe when she first spawns in
She did the diff decorations for every level she did
you uploaded this video on my birthday so i couldn't see it when is came out!!
All of those walls are things of her origins
Those decorations are for each one of her lives
We are living in the last time, so repent, people, of your sins! Two Horsemen of the Apocalypse have already come out: pestilence and war...
Hi
please try to live for a little more, i think your he only one who was 6 or 5 lives, im not hating is just aleways losing origins for no reason
Ur such a good builder and so funny lizzie, every single vid u make me laugh!
Lizzie try another 100 days in Minecraft
Every room in her house was one of her origins
I know what the mystery is from her base  it is going through her life as you can tell the red whole is from her life as a raccoon then the goo the blue and amethyst was from her alien life and the flowers and pumpkins was as a flower girl and then comes she has a parrot clorlorful background and a head
YALL HER FEATHERS ARE THE PANSEXUAL COLORS!! PAN PARROT!! Is so cute!!!
The weird things in her house is her past lives
short lives but the best abilities
LIZZIE I LOVE YOU SM!!! Your deaths make me sad but also laugh at how fast your life is rolling 🥲🥲🥲
Her lies are true. Evil dwells high. Light starts shadows. Life kills worse. Origins futile.
I feel like as time progressed, lizzie just started taking the series less and less seriously. I mean at this point whenever she gets a new origin she just plays around with it and does whatever she can do while she's that current origin.
Lizzie almost said the f word
I know!The nukes are representing all of her origins!
So sad
I think I solved the mystery every little part of your base represents what you did in your past life sand represents your past life
Love the origins and the villain twist also the puzzle is things from you previous lives sorry to spoil
10:57 😭🤣😂
LIZZIE! Stop DYING!
Now you are ✨ KNUCKLES ✨
The little areas are past origins
You do realize that all the nooks is of her past life
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.   (2 Peter 3:9)
shes a master at dying
Is this the monster in the bird box?
parrot lizzy it adorbs
Now noticing that the decorations are related to her past origins..
lizzys villian arc starts now lol
join scots evil leauge he needs members and you are really evil and sinister like that
I love how lizzie is becoming evil lizzie from kingdom's
Can we count the bird life as the fastest death in Afterlife🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
10:57 "UH WHAT THE FFFF-- BLAZERS WAS DAT" LADY JUST SAY F U C K ALREADY
lizzies enigma origin literally is the definition of “never let ‘em know your next move”
I understand the base >:)
I actually cried during this episode. SHE LOST AN ORIGAN IN ONE EPISODE. 5 CHANCES. FIVE. And we should all appreciate how she uses her english acent.
U made this house as your deths
She litterLay died again-
I’m worried 😐YoUr GoNnA LoSe AlL YoUr LiVeS
i was so excited about the bird one aswell :|
Oops poking to soon
Make sure Scott doesn’t kil u
i think we all know why lizzie is dying a lot, don’t get me wrong i absolutely adore your videos but i wish you would spend more time on series/ smps, or even make a single player world again :)
Please don't  die
How can we join to your minecraft afterlife server. My brother is your biggest fan.he wants to play in your afterlife server.
10:56 "What the f-.....blazes is that?" I saw what you did there Lizzie XD
Lizzie when is Empires season 2 coming ?  Cuz I can't wait
me every 2 seconds: PLEASE DONT DIE PLEASE DONT DIE PLEASE DONT DIE  and PLEASE can u kill lauren?? GET REAL REVENGE here's my plan: first u search for her then hide and just keep staring :)....
I understand the decortions
The nocks are actually describing her past orgins
omg... Lizzie slowly going insane at the end of the video...
lizzie takes damage" oh my- WTF😱😨🤐  *also lizzie after that mess*  lizzie: BOII WAS I STOOPED   edit: lizzie does kind of actually fits in this role smh(?)
Did anyone else notice that the helmet looks like a face
Lizzie almost swearing?😕
I think I understand the secret base                               They represents Lizzie so past lives a raccoon,floral,goolien and bird
I love how lizzy became incredibly posh for about 30 seconds while a boar was chasing her
Okay dose she know there is a villain club on the server
10:57 is no one gonna talk about how she almost swore 💀💀
How did you customise your elytra?   It so cool I want to do the same.
THE DECOR IS ALL LIZZIES PAST LIVESSS
I figured out what she’s doing in her base >:)
Lizzie should join Scott's villain club!  Edit: I just realised that he died so create ur own villain club!
Lizzy: “FFFFFFFFF- blaze Is ThAt?!?”😂
I am now Officially scared of Lizzie and what she’ll do next
The nooks are all the origin u had? Cause the honey is like for when u was a flower person and the bird one for start of the video. So I think the nooks are all the origins u had btw am a fan :D
Amazing
I think I have discovered what all the sections were for. After watching this many times, I think each one represents all the different lives Lizzie has had. There is one for her floran, raccoon, bird, raccoon and the others she has had.
She was a bird for 1: 54 seconds, I think that’s the quickest I’ve ever seen someone live then die in modded Minecraft
How much haved you died?
I think all the little areas in het house represents her past livez
Lizzie you died seven times you are on the brink of death pleas make empires season 2 pleas pleas thanks for doing this vid please do not end after life in the next two eps by
Girl u got to be careful u only have 5 lives😐
I think that the decoration is each single origin
YESSSS YOU LIVE 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
See what people think about the enigmatic
Hewoo lizzie i found this video comment on it!!  Creator: Zealand Epic Gamer Video name:i will build a castle if ldshadowlady comments on this video
I recmend deth
Noo you were so cute as a bird !
10:58 😬
the nooks are her previous origins-
Lizzie can you please do longer videos like atleast 20 minutes
So basically  I think the rooms were her past origins the white room for kangaroo as it have a boat from being killed by a fish and a cactus for desert Flower room being floran  Crystal gooey room being a alien Dumpster room being raccoon  LAST BUT not least the parrot because parrot head
She’s always dying
Ldshadylady i feel like in ur decorations  thats all ur origins or deaths in after life
Gurl you have died multiple times
I have watched the video yet but I bet she's going to 😵
Finnaly i been waiting
I know you’re scrolling and looking for the comment about the Pansexual colours
i love this smp iv wachit so much i meraride the ep
I love how the birb origin was the first origin that she didn't lose intentionally, I can't wait to see the enigma origin story unfold! Hopefully it'll last a little longer this time 🤞did anyone else hear something about "fhwip" when she was killing that enderman?
those decorations were your previous lives!
Genuinely scary towards the end.
Love it
anyone hate that half the comment sections is bots? like damn
Bruh u died as a birb
the small mysterious areas show all of lizzie’s past origins from a raccoon to an end floran to a goolein then a kangaroo and finally a birb.
Hi Lizzie me and my sister are always watching your vidio and we are both subscribe. We are very excited whenever you make new vidio's we always watch it and download it.💖😁
She sounds like Ronald Weasley 😂 😆 also the ending was kinda creepy 😨
There's so many bots in the comments... YouTube, what's happening!?!?
LD was well... not ld to me but more... Lauren when she murdered the parrot
Yayyyyyyyy lizzies back!!!!
10:58 Lizzie Almost Said The F Word
Can she kill Lauren since she killed you
lizzie really exposing herself with her parrot skin
I like how you decorated your house with decorations that are based off your past origins
i love tihs
Continue!!
Lizzie how many times have you died it is only episode 8
Spawned in a cave died in a cave
Yay Lizzie! You survived more than one episode!!!  ❤❤❤
I know what your house means it all points to……………………………………………………………………..YOUR PAST LIVES
i was so ready for a parrot life!
I'm scared this episode will end soon..
Kill Lurenzside, for she has betrayed you... Then take her place at the villain club thing!
Please stop dyimg pleaase pls pls pls
The strange decorations are to represent her old origins
WAIT IS IT JUST ME KR WERE THE DECORATIONS IN THE BASE HER PAST LIVES?- THATS SO COOL
oh no! my one weakness! being weak! -Enigma Lizzie
She was so small compared to the dry plant
Amazing video can't wait to see what other evil enigma things you do next episode also hope you don't die😄👌🏾
is it just me because i feel like lizzie is speedrunning the series..
Anyone notice that the decorations are her past lives? Parrot head - bird origin Blue slime? With amethyst - Goolian origin The red one - Raccoon origin Flowers from the end - floran origin
actually for those things and the colorful thing u said u will need to find a bird. i think those are just some things that you added to represent ur lives before, the red one is for the raccoon the parrot one is for ur life before u died and etc. that's only a theory of mine,
I just want to say, 10/10 on the intro animation.
I know the decorations in the house its the origins like that place where It has the beehive that was when she was a floran and that place where the amathist wall is when she was a goolien
I’m a genius cause i know how Lizzie decorated her room, they’re her past origins
Hello I have been your Channel and is only getting better, Keep up the good work!!!
(Did not just pranked anyone)*
The map spoils The secret place. Oof
The lil holes are your past origins >:)
Lizzie, the kangaroo did'nt do much after all so can you put sand as the floor to remind that you dod mot iust prank anyone but to make remind the kangaroo origin. Also put these things on yhe wall on the kangaroo origin cage or what ever you call it: pumpkins with a cow head on top from spk, a now ball on an item frame not just to remind of the item you pranked sausage also because of spk snow prank and 1 block of water on the floor to reming of lauren getting pranked
She's died so many times I can't keep track!
The thing is that says birb not bird 😂😂
"BIRB"
by the way Lizzie is a scarlet macaw
Noooooooooooo I just realised that if she servived as a bird she could live in her original house from she was a raccoon 🦝
Lizzie you can actually trap a parrot or cat or wolf in a boat and give it a name tag the you have a pet
I remember when lizzie was doing the 1 life series :D who else remembers 1 life
Lizzie, stop speedrunning through your lives
You have had 5 whole Minecraft multiplayer series (some modded) with the word life in the name
Yay!.. somehow you're not dead! 🙃✌️
Ok I think she should be given back her bird life, it ended like way too quickly, and she wasn’t even spawned at spawned which is unfair. But again it’s the rules so this is fate.
This is a crazy coincidence. When lizzie said that it would all be orange I was drinking a fanta.
i love how she died😶‍🌫
LIZZIE ALMOST SAID FVCK ON CAMERA!?!?!?
Me without knowing she an actual birb:BIRRRB Me now knowing it:WAIT SHES AN ACTUAL BIRB
I know why she made those little nooks! Bc of the creature she used to be it was very obvious lol
I wonder if she will join the villain group
Yeeesss Lizzie is on trending😆😆
i think you want to do empirse season 2
each little room resembles each orgin
From 3 episodes to 2 episodes to 1 episode to 2 minutes...
Well... in my opinion that enigma origin is useless
Poor Elizabeth/lizzie
You're mysterious thing I know what the nooks are for they're for all your lives you had but you died
Lizzie - Oh no, my only weakness, being weak!  Me - dat is de definition of meh
challenge for u lizzie - dont die
I love how her decors are her past orogins, and the fact the she almost swear in camera
guys if u havent noticed the nooks are her previous orgins!!
⤴️Justin Bieber Meta royalties are now available !..
The "Mysterious" decorations all represent past origins.
s t o p d y i n g  p l e a s e y o u w i l l o n l y h a v e 6 m o r e e p i s o d e s i f y o u  d o n t s t  o p
The rooms or decorations Lizzie made are the origins Lizzie once had. IM A GENIUS
I love how Lizzie incorporated her other origins in her new base. (Definitely not in nooks, I’m not a detective =D)
Hi! Um, do you know when Empires 2 is coming ?
Nooooooo  she died as a bird
I already figured out the "secret" puzzle behind the little nooks for the secret base. . . . . . . . They represent her old origins.
The house decorations or to remind you of your pass life's LMAO you died so much to day lol
All of the things in her base all resemble her past lives
"Sorry!😟 Whoevers Portal That Is😥 But You Have A New Guest😰 The Guest Has Arrived😳 And His Name😣 Is Death💀"    The Best Rhyme Of The Year
OK but I'm still waiting for Lizzie  To use her clone ability
BTO JUST STOP DIEING
its kinda a genius when lizzie made the part of her house that corresponds of her previous life. so cool
the decorations are for every origin you have been in, and that's why you need the parrot for the first origin that you have been in this episode
The room things she was building were her past origins...
lizzy needs more lives 10 not going to be enough <3
the decorations are every life she has had
Just why !! How many ties have you died?!
Bruh this series is gunna be done so fast at the rate on how fast she is dying
WHYY did u take soo long to post 😭
The decorations on her base represent her past lives
pls dont die again
All the different call different colored areas are from from your your previous life
Hello Lizzie! Luv the new origin! Uh.. Can i ask for a "Happy Birthday" From you? Since i've been watching you since 2016 and it'll be a wish grated for my Birthday! Even though you don't know me it will still amazing!  My Birthday Is Tommorow :'D   I Luv U
Lizzie no need for hidden waterfall entrance, you can literally shift through walls :D (Maybe have a hidden room of death that only you can  access? :D
Hiii I’m lete
Finnaly ldshadowlady we are so worried,we miss you so muchhh😭😭😭
LIZZIE ALMOST CUSSED !!
You always die in funny playsis
Are the nooks for your past life’s / oragins that u have had
I love how Lizzie forgot all her abilities except her staring contests 😂
Are the nooks for the life’s that you have had
Bruh how she gunna do us like that? Respect, but I love this content . I know it takes time to make but INEEDMORE!!!!
she said it was "to complex" BUT I FIGURED IT OUT LD!!!!!!!
when she made her base, all the little rooms were based on her pasted origan's, like when she went to get a parrot she did that to do her birb life, and that one with the goo and amithyst that was her goolian life ( sorry about my bad spelling )
The fact the mod spelled it "Birb" instead of bird....it just....well, it is what it is.
When you realize she doesn’t actually have a waterfall entrance
i think i know what th decrorations mean its all her old orgins
it's good that Lizzie didn't die here
Post Mo videos
Lizzie is dying so much
I would like to take a guess that Lizzie's nooks in her base are based off her past lives, kinda figured it out right away. One is her raccoon one, floran, the googly thing, kangaroo, parrot/birb, and then the rest of the house is enigma. :D
I was expecting a death at the end. Thank you, lizzie, for not dying.
I know what your doing in your house a spot for every Origin I knew it the second I saw the raccoon section
ur secret base is all about ur origins before. it was quite easy :D
Each nook in a different life
The tiny nooks are based of the passed lives. It didn't take me more than 30 seconds to realize. But they are really cool.
omg i was so prepared to see cute parrot things but boom zombie hole
Next episode kill Lauren and Scott
Bruh💀
I was so exited about her being a bird and then she just died lol I love how she decorated her base the best part is the "secret"
Lizzie is speedrunning the series at this point
the nooks are her past lives!!
Did anyone notice her sock on the second power she got !? It was pan!!
Guys!!! The little areas  that have unique things represent her past origins!!
I believe The decorations stands for each of her origins ☺️
What mod do you use for the blocks, biom, etc?  Also, I understand what it feels like dying 1 trilloin times each second... :3.
Idk if anyone noticed but the decorations she put in her base thing seem to represent some of her past orgins :P
But I’m feeling nice today and won’t tell
I Know your secret Lizzie
LIZZIE EVERY TIME YOU GO IN A Dimension you scary me half to death
she survived an episode (kinda)
Surprised he didnt die to the pig XD
You added something from every life
Omg you didn’t die I’m so happy for you
In the small places your putting in a representative of each life you have been through
How many lives does she have left OMG
:*spoiler alert*: Has anyone else noticed Lizzys enigma has the outfit of the end floral, a sock of the bird, the other sock is for the kangaroo and her arms are green for the goolien, but she doesn’t have anything for the racoon.  *if you see something that is for the racoon please tell me*
I thought y’all only had 4 life’s  Good you have more life’s
All the "mysterious" decoration in her hq are all the past origin she had
The little decorations are her inspired from her past lives I found this out when she said she needed a bird and saw the details in the other areas 😅
I know what the spots are for they are for all of her life’s she had.
Pls don’t die
The coves are for all of the lives she has had
Okay writing this before I watch the video but if she dies in this episode from somebody else’s acts I will cry once again because she did NOT DESERVE to have the alien taken away from her.
I know the mystery for the nooks. Your making a nook for every death you have had.
YES VILLAIN TRY TO MAKE AN ALLIANCE WITH SCOT
What the- blazeihs is that
It feels like every episode lizzy dies 💀
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
I understand what she did
awesome!!! love seeing unique origins and how you played into each one perfectly
dude why your always dying atleast try to live damn
Lizzie you didn’t remember? You were a kangaroo it said you’ll spawn in a desert😑😑
She should join the villains
"Birb"
I think the decors lizzie used for her base were inspired by all her past origins  Btw this is only a thought- im not really sure
LDShadowLady you should do some afterlife streams
I love how lizzie build rooms of her origins its so mysterious and also cool :D
she is also making the decorations with the orgins she had
I’ve figured out what the areas are already there each creacher she has been
lol i think the waterfall is at where her favorite jellyfish was when she was a alien
Ur evil
Love the colors of your left sock <3
At 10:32 it said "Joel = Hot & Big" LMAOO-
Finally an episode where Lizzie didn’t die at the end!!
Girl we can just look at the map
I think the britny spears got to her head
I think the nooks resemble every origin she’s had
Seriosly, is easy to discover the walls, it is obiosly  the old lifes of LDShadowLady
One villain goes... Another one comes
She almost said the f word 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
2:20 i thought the episode was just gonna end there
Are we not going to talk about how it says “birb”?🤣
i like how lizzie gets like the best origins then continues to die with them after one episode..
Ldshadowlady made nooks to represent her past after lifes like the panda and the alian
The nooks represent her past origins
Wonder what the nooks  are…       !Spoilers below!            Most may be her old lives*
Its her past life murals which she died of like raccoon,Parrot,ect😂
She's doing it so fast because she wants to showcase all the origins in videos because she probably didn't want this to become a huge series since she might be planing other things. And i love her for doing that because it keeps the SMP interesting and entertaining to watch because some people could get bored easily by it. She probably plans it for one origin per episode but if she dies by mistake she still continues. Much love to Lizzie❤️
ME: WAIT WHAT
Lizzie: WHAT THE F- …blazes… was that?!
Me: See's That its bird is spelled wrong  LDShadowLady: Bird
Pfft- the example on enigma- my name is ‘Madeleine’ 🤣
IF YOU MINE UNDER CLAY YOU MOST LIKELY FIND DIAMONDS
Whelp I'm scared of lizze
The displays are all of her lives.
Lizzie be killing her lives faster than Henry the VIII be killing his wives
At least she didn’t die this episode
LIZZIE VILLAN ARC LIZZIE VILLAN ARC!
STOP DIEING D:
Every nook repsents a past life
I love the intro and the bird skin
I love the intro and the bird skin
The nooks represents each life she’s had
Bird: doesn’t accept offerings   Lizzie: GOOD BYE BIRDIE
Birds replacment
lizzie you spawned in a cave in a dessert because of your passed origin
STARE DOWN SCOTT
Finally an episode we’re she doesn’t die at the end
How many more times can she dye before she has to leave afterlife
Her; look how beautiful I am! Just me noticing how the feathers are the same colour as the pansexual flag
you should join scotts villan league  🧛🧛‍♀
I was just wondering how many lives have ya lost because you might have to be careful
This series is gonna end rq because of the amounts of death-
BTW I think we know where ur base is
You put all your life's in your new base
To the people that didn’t figure it out yet every section is all her recent origins
I understand it's all the lives  that you died as ☺️
I loved how you died in the bigging and you did not care
Poor lizzie
I have a feeling that she is gonna be tha first one who gets kicked out of the smp
All the walls are representing your past lives it’s really simple
10:57 liz forgot she was child-friendly
The birb skin is just pan vibes, you cannot lie
The little Nooks are lizzys past lives
Ugh I love this series I just wish Lizzie started to be more carful and stop burning through these lives like matches 💀
I want to be a bird!! 😍
please tell me she didn't die again   edit: nvm
Don't mean to burst your bubble or anything but am I the only one that kind of wants for the die
The ending is kind of creepy though with that music lol. I want to know the mystery!!!!
How quaint, that she thinks she can trick us!  Clearly, those strange niches are representatives of the prophecies from the last SMP!   /j
“How is she gonna die while flying, she’ll probably be a bird for a good while” …. 5 seconds later *dies*
Lizzie!! In your next series you should definitely add a face cam, I love seeing your expressions! 🙀🫶🏻💖
She didnt die at the end!
Is she hiding in katherine's mountain?? I mean there is a lot of dire rite in the mountain.
The bird is super cute!
I am a bit scared?!?
WOW SHE SURVIVED MORE THEN ONE EPISODE wait no no she didn’t she died as a bird two mins aftar I forgot I think Lizzie has the record for most deaths and most origins and least amount of eposides that’s why makes these videos she just dies every time her longest life was like three episodes as a raccoon w
Mystery mystery bring a bird for a secret reason wow such a mystery NO ITS NOT your making werid strines of your old life’s which is creepy now that I think of it the honey for end floran the goo for the goo alien ect
All your deaths you made in your base
Hey by the way the colors of your skin or the colors of the pansexual flag just to let you know, I mean if he did it on purpose good for you!  💖💛💙
The mysterious secret in her home as all her other lives 🥸🥸🥸🥸
Omg an episode that doesn’t end in her death is this real??
I’m pretty sure the secret is that it the live of her origan thingy
You got a problem Lizzie, some people are after you to see your origin, even if you have to die for them to know
As soon as Lizzie said she was a bird that spawned in a cave, my immediate thought was, "So....a bat? Or an owl?" Little bummed I was wrong, but still, bird Lizzie is adorable as ever...and just as I finish typing, she's dead. LMAO
Lizzie: *casually models pansexual flag as a bird costume*  Me: O-O HINT????
at least she didnt die at the end, also i think that the decorations are fragments to her past lives
i know what those random walls are its all her lifes
Lizzie plz name a bee beelone
I hope next episode we don’t tragically die again lmao. Enigma looks so cool!!!
I think the little nooks in Lizzie's house represent her past origins I'm not completely sure but that's what I think :)
Ngl you look kinda like fem saiki k
I can’t she just got a new one and then she died what😂
The crevices in your home symbolize all your different origins
I think the ’nooks’ may be her past origins? But like the cow one I can’t think of one for that just an idea
I feel like Lizzie is some sort of end mob, with her capabilities of being able to teleport and stare things down, but that's just a theory, A YOUTUBE THEORY
Lizzie..its the 8th episode get your self together you have died more then anyone in the game 😭      Btw: im in love with the pan-sexual colors socks on the avatar....i am pan-sexual myself :]
all past lives puzzle I did it
Relly
All ymthe nute it for all the form she got.
At least you didn't die at the end to make everyone wonder
GUYS WAIT I JUST REALIZED THAT THERE WHERE PAN FLAGS ON HER PARROT AND ENIGMA SKINS PLS TELL ME IM NOT WRONG
Omg she alomst said the f word
SHE SURVIVED An episode as a new origin for pence 😂
the things in her home are stuff that is from her last lives
Is it sad that she has lived as a raccoon longer than anything else
I know what the decor means it is all the lives you had
I know what the decorations is everything you’ve ever been
Your little enigma trick couldn’t fool me….I know what the nooks mean! It was a great idea and I won’t spoil anyone who wants to figure it out for themselves! Love this new origin for you Lizzie!
👍👍👍
I loved the birb life I’m so sad it was so short
i think the new like nooks and details are of  lizzie’s past lives👍👍😋
U are not acting like U
howt f  die again?
At 12:23 you can see her arm causes her to be able to x-ray through the water. You can see the black perfectly in her arm
I think the decorations are your past origins 😃
The only question that I have, is how long did it take her to make that base?
I know what’s she is doing for her base. She is showing her deaths of her animals she had been. I am a smart brain
I think the secret base decor is based off of the lives she had
Just me or is anyone else scared of Lizzie's violence?
Personally I think all the random nooks in Lizzie’s base resemble all of Lizzie’s past lives/origins…  Also 10:57 did Lizzie almost swear like “what the fuu blazers was that I’m being attacked by a pig” questioning all life choices  lol
The walls are her last origins  ( I’m not sure I’m guessing)
I love how when you and joel became extremely small, you both died to quickly 😅
'whAT The FFFF- (realises)....... BlaZZerSsSs is THAT!!!!!!!'
I think it's like a nook for every origin you've had so far
Never let them know your next move
You need a brid because that is all your deaths.
What resource packs do you use? Also you have really inspired me in gaming, I am a girl and I always get bullied for playing Minecraft. You are my hero! Love ya! 💗💗💗💗
2:13 World record Fastest to die
Lizzie: “what the f-“ Lizzie: “what the blazes is that!”  I caught that Lizzie.
the awnser to the riddle is the odd things discribe her old origins
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                      ./                           .,                        .,/, /,/ ,./, // .        ,/.
You lived more than ten seconds, good on you Lizzie
LIZZIE, STOP DYING
Bird
Brid
Lizzy was a bridge for 2 minutes
YAY YOU DIDINT FIE I HOPE YOU STAY LIKE THat
the new base is making me think all these lives is starting to drive her crazy😂
T-T Lizzie is gonna be the first out...
You should take over the evil team and ally yourself with the heroes.
You look like the pansexual flag if it had wings.
Lizzie’s main goal :survive one episode
I now why she put nucks there its for all here life's because thats here last one
The nooks are inspired by your past origins
try not to die lizzie, this origin is so cool 😎
Lol her house  designs are just here past lives
Lizzie you need a desert section in your secret base… for no particular reason :)
Lizzie pigs are evillllllll
10:57 the fact lizzie almost cussed then realized her mistake 😹
Lizzie's nooks are her lives, her past ones.
Lizzie : WHAT THE FFfFFfFFFFffffffffffff Us : lol 😆
Took me about 5 seconds to realize your "enigmatic nooks" each represent one of your past lives 🤓 very cool! Also I was about to suggest taking a parrots head since you can't tame them, then .2 seconds later you did just that 😂
The nooks in her base are the Origins she used to be
we can see were you are on the map
Please please stop dying every episode please
I feel like she got crazy
All I can say is BARRACUDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I ALREADY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU PUT THOSE DECORATIONS  reason or example: she needed a parrot for a memory that she was once a parrot
Keep your eyes on the prize... until the prize dies!
I love how the little nooks in her base represent her past origins!!✨ very creative and beautiful ^^✨
Why didn’t you phase thru the wallsssssss and as a parrot you could’ve just jumped/flew out the hole
I love Lizzie videos!there so joyful and funny,I could binge watch her videos all day,which I have done before...She is amazing and kind and I smile when I see in my notifications that she posted a new video🤩🌸🌸🌸💖💖💖💖
Does anyone know where I can find the full list of Origins and their descriptions? I found a mod titled "Origins++", which is presumably what they're using, but I couldn't find the descriptions of the origins. Sad because these are fascinating!
I understand the ways of your headquarters, a part of every origin's house!
i love your video
Anyone else notice that in both of the origins how the outfits have pansexual pride flag colors, idk just thought I'd point that out
The nooks are of your uh- past lives.
her mysterious base decorations represent her past origins :D
i surprise lizzie is still a live. i feel that next ep she will be died
EACH NOOK REPRESENTS EACH PAST LIFE OF YOURS!
The bird origin was too kind and not maleficent enough for our queen of trouble haha
girl we missed you
you can seee where she is from the map top left
I think the decorations were based on the past powers ? I think Yes if I am right tell me I’m smart!!
I just realised it's all her origin
Well she represents her previous lives in those certain  sections
Not Lizzie about to cuss
girl cuit DIEING
aren't those rooms spouse to be your past origins
Poor Lizzie she has it so rough
SHE LIVED!!! all hail thy queen. Also it's your origins lizzy.   New villain?
We NEED villain Lizzie!
Is it just all the things she’s been in this Sires
The nooks are based on your past origins I found it out XD
Are the mini rooms like a thing for all your lives in this serie?
5:22  Did anyone else hear the enderman say "No! Wait!" when Lizzie was killing it??
Me who’s been watching old series the last few weeks, thinking i missed this haha
Wait, do all the different nooks represent her origins? Like if you agree!
The fact Lizzie died as soon as she became a bird was so funny 🤣 -Kat
Really sad she died when she was a bird .
Every nook represents a past origin.
EACH DENT IN HER HOUSE IS HER DIFFERENT LIFES!!!!!
lizzie’s villain arc
I GOT THE BEST MUSIC EVER!🔥
me still; I STILL WONDER WHY DOES LIZZY DIE SO QUICK
Thus is a good ep but it don't want this season to end so please stop dieing
why so much death :(
Maybe you should try to keep a life
I challenge you - if my channel reaches 1000 Writes Today I will delete the channel.
are those secters rooms 10:00 are her past lives like end florian and an alien? that would be intresting
Are the nukes all your last origins?
The nooks are for some of her past lifes
i love how each nook is a past life, what a fun inclusion!
the new shortest lasting origin is the birb that only lasted 2 mins and 14 seconds
Haha funny
Not ding
LOVE Lizzies content!!!!!!
I love your Videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!
At 11:00 she was about to swear
I like that you made the nooks representing your lives is a cool idea
You are the best!!!!!!!!!!
Next episode you should kill Lauren and Scot
I'm a big fan omg
The only thing i can think off when i see her birb skin is the panflag 😂
Lizzie just don't go to the End or Nether. You may die/nearly die again.
Bruh I have a pet parrot rn😵😬
ALL OF THE NOOKS ARE LIZZIES DIFFERENT LIVES! I SOLVED IT!
OMG LIZZIE YOU ALMOST CUSSED- AT 10:58
Is lizzie pansexual? Because every skin in this video had the pansexual flag.
Kill all endermen !
"what the ff" HAHAHAHAHA
She spawned in a cave cause it predicted that she would die in a cave😳
good job enigma
U most... WHEN I'M CAMPING I HQVE JUST COME BACK AND ... MMMHHH
10:13 aww it’s her old origins 🥰
oho when lzzie turns evil for an orgin  every  begans to worry
Join the villains !!!!!!!!join the villains!!!!!
I don't know if the clip was different but did I just see were the waterfall was💀😭
I love how Scott always gets the op origins, Lizzie gets the cute origins, and Jimmy gets the terrible origins   Edit: Well this aged horribly
so when someone on afterlife  dies 6 times they become like all their past origins
Each decoration represents all the lives she had
Lizzie! All the pigs attacked you because you killed their brother pig in the the beginning of the episode!!
If there is a axolotl role you should use your blue axolotl outfit from empires
As I saw the thumbnail I was     Omg she died again
Those little decorations were all the lives Lizzie had lived before
She does way to much like I think you should make a house that can be used for most lives so you don’t have to keep building and like I’m confused why ur not just asking others for challenges or help or likeeee
I'm pretty sure your secret base is right next to spawn, based on the mini-map
One word don’t die
When she scream oh no (7:11) my sister screamed avada kadavra like Voldemort and I’m dead. xD
i cant belive how short this series is going to be, i love ur channel lizzy, and i got excited when you got parrot
When Lizzy started putting slime I was like oh she must have that must be all her organs she has been especially because of the bird
The random wall sections in the new base represents all her past origins.  The red “house” is Raccoon. Pumpkin with honey is End-floran. Slime and amethyst represents Goolian (block of copper with rod is mini spaceship). Boat and cows is Kangaroo. Colourful wall is Parrot
ohh well i think you wanted to return the nice death gift to Lauren so you could hide somewhere near her and stare at her till she dies from an unknown reason muahaha sorry lauren
8:30 your map
Enigma is actually very cool! You’re an amazing Enigma, even though you’ve been amazing for every origin you’ve had I think you’ll do Enigma really well!
I FOUND OUT WHAT UR "MYSTERY ROOM" IS ABOUT
Her house and the nooks are all her orgins!! The boat means her death as a kangaroo and the pumpkin head means end Floran the red a black thing is raccoon lizzy and the colorful wool is a parrot!!
I know what the mystery is it they are all the times you died
I love your video
Two minutes if birb
I think all the stuff that you added where are your Old lives or homes
Lizzie never go to the end😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Pls make vids more often I've been waiting for this for soooo long
i love how in her base she bult little nooks based off of her last origins
She shows us where her headquarters is! 10:30
Hello little ant😂🤣
Lizzie: im a bird!   side of screen: you are now a BIRB! You have 6 lives left
Lool I figured it out as soon as she showed her bass. Every little segment is what she has lived as for example she was collecting bird heads for her birb life and the one with the stick is her raccoon life.
You died in your parrot origin... But at least you survived in the....what is that origin again? I hope you don't die in your next episode
You have 3 life’s left
Raccoon, Floran, Alien, Kangaroo, and Bird. All of these are the weird mysterious decorations.
I don’t know if anybody else figured it out, but all the nooks and crannies are Lizzie’s past lives on the server!
It’s my birthday today and for the past few years I’ve always watched one of Lizzie’s videos that said happy birthday to whoever’s birthday it is, and it’s always made me feel better when no one would say happy birthday to me. Thank you Lizzie 🥰
honestly expected you to die from fall damage at the end as a parrot but no it was worse
Ok we know that lizzie can't deal damage through swords,axes or tools... But what about potions?
Who’s gone get to ten first? Lizzie or Joel 😂
Lizzie pls stop died😢
Mysteries not your origins
Hey, are you pansexual? Sorry for asking, I just looked at your character and it had the pan flag!!
the decoration and random stuff are from her life for example parrot, and florist I think...
i just realised that Lizzie’s avatar is the Pan flag🤭
✨Birb✨
awesome!!! love seeing unique origins and how you played into each one perfectly 🔥
Yass queenn
You base is based on all your origins!
Anyone else know what the nooks are if not there just her past orgins
I would really like something like the empire series its my fav series you get a random biome and must have a avatar like the biome you get you also get some tools incase there are no trees or materials
The nooks resemble all her origins
For anyone who does not know: she based the rooms off her past life (s).
I understood your mysterious nooks  I'm really smart am I? 🤓
The raccoon wall was abit hard to understand, until i saw those jelly things only to realize the walls were in honor of her past lives
Fun fact: There's actually only 9 origins like:Shulk,Feline,Avian,Phantom,Merling,Blazeborn,Elytrian,Enderian,and Arachnid but those other origins are just custom origins made by an other person or people
Kangaroo Lizzie dies trying to find the Desert bird Lizzie spawns in the Desert
really cute on how to replace Minecraft without difference in ppl  isn't in it without leaving any places it's very
Wot the fff……. BLazEs was thaT!
I loved how you did your past lives, job well done!
Lizzie did you forget about your other Chanel lizziepads
When she’s looking for a parrot and you suddenly remember that she can’t tame anything: D:
6:45 I wonder whos portal that is T___T
Is it wrong that I know like the evil synergy Because I I like that you just sinister Lizzy I don't know why but I like how she's like dark and Mysterious And super cool
Does her thing it is very cool how she plays it is  she is a very creative I like
Rip ldbirblady.
lizzie:*goes to trees me: SHE'S IN RIO!!!!! (btw rio is a movie
It is cool how she
You got three lives left
lizzie almost swear🤣
endermen dont kill you if u keep staring at them! useful fact.
RIP
Im honestly shocked she was able to stay as the enigma until the end of the episode 😂
“Ah a volunteer!“  “ *die pig* “  The pig:what did I doooooooooooo
Oh its all your lives the mystery 😅
I like how lizzie i recreating her past lives and putting them in her new home:)
i guessed her role lets gooooooooooooo
The decorations on her house are the origins she had
I think she is decorating her base with her other origins if she already said that I didn’t know bc I’m halfway in the vid
l think Lizzie's base is some sort of museum to all her previous origins
I know your secret inside of your base you know those little sections there's everything you've been From a raccoon to a foreign To a bird
Sorry if a was to far 😟

the corner things are a reference to all your past lives, i instantly noticed when i saw them all. not such a mystery anymore!
I solved the nooks, each one is themed after one of Lizzie's lives. However, I am not sure what the aquatic and lighting one is about. I am guessing it's a refrence to Empires. Just my theory though 😊
lol the guest's name is death and is her decorations from her past lives
10:58 “What the ff- Blazes is that?!” Lizzie - 2022 😂
The interior means her past lives, it's obvious. What a smart way to fill in empty spaces in your house in after life.
5 on trending! She posts less but whenever she does it's on trending. Ur amazing
Who else has been counting down the days till Lizzie post
You look like the pan flag lol Edit: as a bird
Sorry Lizzie, but is there one episode that Lizzie didn't die?
Hello
Number 5 on trending :0
The Enigma… Lizzie’s Villain Arc She seems to be like Slenderman so I think you could be called Slenda! The shadow of the server! The sneaky killer! I really hope you don’t lose this origin Lizzie! This is a great origin!
OMG She didnt die at the end! im just so suprised how she stayed alive as enigma
Each pocket represent one of your lives
I LOVE YOUR VİDEOS AN I WANT MORE
You could fly to get out of the hole
Am I the only one who realized that her colors are the same as the pan sexual flag? Wich I think I only realized that because I sort of… am… pan
each nook represents one of her afterlives
I love how she loses her sanity at the end
I immediately understood the little nooks, they're to represent all of her past lives!
Lizzie saying her hideout is secret but goes out to the secret waterfall walking straight to the spawn area. Not so secret anymore HAHAHAHHAHA
Omgg I waited days for thiss
your old origins are in your base
how did I just now realise that Lizzie's Enigma skin is a combination of all her past lives
Her old origins
How do you get after life?
I know it's about all her last regains and then the orange is her regain now
i wanted u to be a birb😔
The thing in the wall is all her lifes

LD Shadow lady please make a crazy craft 4.0
Im suprised that lizzie didn't die in the end lol
AWWWWWW ITS SUCH A CUTE ORIGIN AGAIN luv u lizzie and dead again and also creepy
The nusks are youre after live lives
HIW MANY OF U WATCH MORIAH ELIZABETH
Ooooo I heard that. Anyone else hear the “WhAt ThE F-“ Never heard anything like the at out of Lizzie Before 😂
I love the suspense throughout the whole episode! Can't wait to see more !
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.
Congrats on number five trending
WHY the bird why I love birds
Cool
LIZZIE SWEARED
All the different rooms are for all your other life’s
The nooks are remembering things from the bird one and the Kangaroo and the others
When she teleported her self to find a parrot 🐦🦜 one of them flew right by her
Pls dont die for 10 ep😭
At 10:58 Lizzie said," what the F---------- BLAZES is that!" Lizzie, don't swear
I found out what the rooms are the honey room is her Origen of a floran
it isn't a lizzie minecraft series if she doesn't have a villain arc
I MISS YOU SMM
Wheres the racoon nook for her racoon life
i just realised the cow heads are just for seapeekay’s house being overran by cows
Her mysterious walls are her past lives
I love how lizzie rember that her you tube channel is family friedly and almpst say the F word
Lizzie should be like a shape shifter because every episode, she dies and changes from her origin every 5 seconds
I know what the rooms are! They are all of her past lives
u can fly oo im jelly
u can fly oo im jelly
I think the little rooms in her house is her past powers
Each one of the nooks is one of her past origins
Lizzie the colors that you are wearing look like the pan flag
2 of my fish died today so I have 3 left and I’m right now crying and I love your videos they cheer me up every time I’m sad
When Lizzie was building those little nook things I was like “ Yea so there is her house from raccoon life and the goolien life Oh and there is her end floren one and that must mean that is the kangaroo one and finally that is the parrot one 😂
Any else find it so funny how she makes those bets on for the past Origins so obvious that there for it
You can hit things just not with tools
You were cute but you died
i know her mystery in her base she needs a bird to show her orgins racoon floran birb and NOW,
The title”I can fly!” Later:Immediately dies and can’t fly
i will not spoil because i saw the reason why you built those
This is so cute<3
At this rate idk how many times she has died 😭
Lizzie u almost said the f word
the nooks in lizzies house is all of her past lives!
Lizzie should join the evil club with Lauren
This was a journey, lol. Fun video! =)
Lizzie. Please. Check. What. Life. Your. On
LIZZIE PLEASE dont die again please :(((((( in ep 9 of after life pls dont die  btw I LOVE UR vids
"Oh no! My one weakness! Being weak!" -Lizzie 2022
They r all of her prievious origins
I'm super genius mystery solving brain is suggesting that the decorations are... from your past lives!
I’m at 10:18 and and I love that she has little shrines for all her past lives
They are trying to figure out ur next origin for u take nearly 3 weeks for a new episodes lol also u lasted 10 mins with birb which is sad but i think u can join the villians leauge since smajor died and nowhe's an angel how sad
"WHAT DA F-"
STOP DIEING YOU'VE LOST 7 LIVES STOPPP!!!!!!!
Each  of the nooks are each of her life
OMG I LOVE LIZZIE !  Pig: *Yeeting lizzie* Lizzie: WHAT THE F-........Blazers
I am so sad that you died after 6 min in the bird life ( I was exited!)
i think all the hole things in the house is all her lifes
LIZZIE please don't die anymoreeee I want to see more of enigma Lizzie
Every ep LDlady dies ☠️😂
“what the f- …….. BLAZES is that?!”  - family friendly lizzie 2022
Watch her die next episode
next episode there won't be anymore origins left and lizzie will be banned from the server..
After that "bird collecting" at the end I'm to scared to leave a like. But I'm going to do it anyways.
She still alive :D
10:57 Shadow lady almost says "fuck"
I know why she did those designs it is for every tipe off creature she lived as
Tour should join the evil villans. With this power  you surely can! :)
Omg just realised the little decor things are to represent all her lives!
Lizzy made  every  room  just  like  her old origns
Lizzie manages to land the best and most adorable species in the game😭
I figured it out each nook  is for a different origin she has had
just realised her fireplace looks like screaming face
LIZZIE PLEAS JUST NOT DIE FOR ONE EPESODE AAAAAAAAH
Lizzie : you will never understand what these decorations in these books are   Me: Each nook represents a previous life
Game: *gives lizzie a cute origin* Zombie: I must kill it.
Could you be apart of the villain club?
My brain *she is prob going to sadly be the first one done*
SHE SURVIVED FOR MORE TAHN ONE EPISODEEEEEE
i got it right i said whats next? dying in episode 0? and boom she died on episode 0 of being a bird
OMG you have one of the scariest (danger/ damage wise) Origin
The little squares are her origins
Hi Lizzie, Can I please just say how much I love your timeline room!! The orange is insanely colourful but that just makes it unique.  I love how you’ve put teasers to all of your builds/origins in the owl coves!! ~Sam
I am convinced no one in this series has died more times than Lizzie has lol
at this point i accept that lizzie is going to die in every episode
I love that your base is orange because it’s my favorite color 😄
I love the decora but I do get what they are about they are all of your life's that you have had. am I right LDShadowLady? tell me in the comment's pleas.
Every decoration is related to her past origins
She should do the past smp where everyone is set in different pasts and each have different advantages
Did she die in this
Finally! Enigma is BRILLIANT for you! Besides the no cat rule
I think the nooks are based of your past lives
Lizzie!!! There was a glitch!! You were supposed to spawn in a desert as a kangaroo but you spawned in a desert when you were a birb. I'm not sure about it though.
why is your skin like that??(⊙_◎(・–・;)ゞ
🌿🤎//i🥺Love😊it🤩Good💯Job💖//🤎🌿
I’ve been waiting for this episode
I know to mystery in the base is all her past lifes
kingdom craft vibes
Hey lizzie- There’s this really underrated game called “cat game” I think it would get a lot of views if you make a video on playing it  -you’re 78th biggest fan
i am SO normal about enigma lizzie. believe me
You could go back to the end it’s SO pretty there is it a mod?
I know why she has her mysterious nooks hehe
“ *Oh no! My one weakness! Being weak!* “ -Lizzie the Enigma
Hey, Lizzie! I've watched your videos forever! I have always supported you, and I hope you have an amazing summer his year. if you notice this I just wanna say you have grown so much and your texture packs and everything are so cool!
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS  i wonder what you’ll do next as a bird
The decorations are all the different origins
the nooks are the origins u were lol
The different walls represent her past origins/life
those small walls- could those be a reminder of her past lives? no- couldn't be  . . . . . lol, i mean it still looks cute :]
If I am right, the crevasses in her base are all past origins, though I didn't see a kangaroo. But that's why she tried/got a parrot because it was an origin she had!
When she was an enigma i know those decorations meaning those decorations are supposed to be some kind of memorable thing of her origins in the past. So cute tho!
I’m happy that you became kind of like the bad guy
Why do you die every vid
I know what the room,s are they are all lizzie,s origins
LDShadowlady you can join the  league of villains
Even if it was supposed to be a villan headquarters, I still think It is very cute all the little bits on the walls showing her previous origins!
I’m guessing that the decorations are shrines or rememberances of your past lives. Is that right?
Lizzie…lizzie please stop dying your lives are very limited
I love how whenever someone gets a evil origin their whole personality changes
The nooks referring to her other houses and things she was
Lizzie almost said a bad word💀
*Lizze came back as a bird* Zombie: Hello there!!you are tasty!! Lizze:NO ,NO!!! *Dies after one second* --__--  ;)
Bet: Lizzie gonna die next ep, or off cam.
i just figured out what the "random" decoration in her base are  the one where she needed a parrot is obviously inspired by her parrot origin  the cow, boat and the white wall are from her kangaroo origin cause she pranked people with those things meaning the white wall is snow.  the red wall with the blackstone roof is inspired from her raccoon origin since she lived in a house with red walls and a blackstone roof  the area with the blue slime and amethyst are obviously from her slime alien i forgot what it was called origin   the beehive area is from her floran origin era  you see what i mean here? all the mysterious decorations there MAY potentially be inspired from her past origins and her skin may potentially be also a mix of all her origins? that one im not so sure about
Anyone else notice the pan flag on her sock?
Each of Lizzie’s little spaces represent her past origins.
Warning spoilers: The nooks were soo cool they were little nooks of some of the diffrent origins
Are you pansexual sorry if I’m mistaken I just wanted to ask
Lizzie when she finally accidentally pronounces “enigma” incorrectly: 🤪😳💀
OMG you look more cute as a birb 😍😍😍
Lizzie u spawned in a desert because u were a kangaroo
THE DECO IS ALL HER LIFES !!!
That was sad with the parrot
Lizzie almost said " what that fuck "
Not  because your orgin  of you stear at  an enderman it cannot move
The decor is all of Lizzie’s lives
Lizzys house is so swag
Me:atleast she survived to the next episode
10:56 gotta keep it pg family friendly over here
Why does it sound like Lizzie is going crazy at the end
I wish you were still a bird but sadly you died but other new powers kind of cool
I really hope Lizzie doesn’t die again any time soon
Lizzie please stop dying for just one episode 😭
shes an enigma 10:55
Please don't die😔
Post more often cause your  vids are so good pls s sss
Not gonna lie HOW MUCH TIMES DID YOU DIEEE????????
The ending was kinda creepy-
Ahhhhhh
Better start calling this series “Life Afterlife”
She’s probably going to die the next ep
Can u prank some players next time plz?
Lizzie can you pleaseeee try to post more often
The nooks are symbols of her previous lives, i think
How meny lifes do you have left?😀
Lizzie i think i know why u spawned in a desert when u first logged o the server because when u where a kangaroo it said u would spawn in a desert sooo ya .......
the decoration things are her old lives
AND YOUR SO GOOD
And YOUR CUTE!
I think lizzes new home with mystery is something to do with all her last lives the bird gave it away so much      (I’m going to be very sad if I’m wrong)
Lizzie Says WHAT THE FREAKING BLAZE
Lizzie lizzie Lizzie i love ur builds but I also love how u always die XD
Lizzie I love you some much but can you maybe try to kill a player? To be a real villan! 😆 It would be an amazing prize for a villan like you
Lizzie is honestly an enigma lol
Lizzie Why don’t u try Forever stranded it could be a great series. Let’s give it a try Lizzie
Your strange decorations involve all of your previous lives. The boats and cows from when you were a raccoon, the pumpkin head from when you were a flora in the end, and the colorful wall from when you were a bird.... for like 10 minutes.
I was so scared near the end if you were gonna die or not but I’m glad you didn’t
Why do she always die!?!?  I very funny content😥
Lizzie is good at after life
I’m assuming they are representing your past lives so please try not to add more 😅
lizzie just say it, say that you just wanted to try every power/ability
she has those nucks for deaths
I subscribed and liked on all my accounts! Love you Lizzie, you always make me smile!
i hope u can live long on your 6th life i dont want your series to end so soon. please be carfull
Every orgin she has she deslayes a Part of it
The mystery I bet she’s gonna do is..       Die and become a new origins like her other videos idk
At 7:30 look at her left sock it’s a pansexual flag colors. Lizzie do u need to tell us something
The coelom are her origins Birb, Florin, Goolien and Racoon!
Nah my face was like this: :0 when u died so quickly XD  but then u got a really cool origin and I hope u actually live on in ur new Eigma life :)
I know what the mysterious decorations mean.........Lizzie's previous origins
wait how many lives does lizzie have left?
Decorations are:  The composter: Raccoon=junk  The flowers and pumpkin: End Floran The slime and amethyst: Alien The cows and boat: Kangaroo The wool and parrot: birb The bookshelves: maybe enigma because codes The fireplace is just a decoration!
I know why you built those little things in your base thingy.Those represent your previous/past lives.
I think all of lizzie's mysterious decorations are all her past lives
i think that the decor is the origins that lizzie was
am i the only one that sees the pansexual flag on her skins?!?
I love how lizzie makes a little place for all of her previous origins! And even tries so hard for an origin she had for around 2-3 minutes<3
All your orgin that you have are on the wall thats the answear
i love all the old mini bases in her new one they are so cute!
The little rooms represent each of her lifes.
What the f- BLAZERS IS THAT 💀😭
Ahhhh!  Ur making walls about every origin u where befor u died (too many times) don't ask how I figured it ooouuut (if I did)
The FIRST TIME SHE MADE IT THROUGH A HOLE VIDEO WITH ONE LIFE ( sorta)
"Am I the bad guy?"
Lizzie's most lived origen was a floren❤😊
just realized that she probably spawned in the middle of nowhere at the start of the video because one of the conditions in her life as a kangaroo was "you naturally spawn in desert biomes"
....
she almost said the First word lol 10:58
Why does this remind me of the “never let them know your next move” meme
Are the knucks in your base your old origin?
You know I'm not an expert or anything but I'm pretty sure that those little nooks that she made in her secret base represents each of one of her lives. 🤣
🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤣🤣🤣
Lizzie: well, I came out of this world just as I came into it…in a hoooollleee  Us: coincidence, I THINK NOT😂
Build a mine please
Did you guys notice the nooks, after one minute I realised they were based off her passed life like the , floran , racoon , parrot , goolien , bird and kangaroo
Is The room for different origins?
Try not to die
at this point they dont value their life and its just like they just want to end this series.
I wonder when Lizzie will actually survive for a long time Lol
9:52 Lizzie : The enigma works in mysterious ways only a great mind could understand  Alan Turing : Finally a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary
I liked it wen you were a kangaroo
Evil ark?! Pog?!
I think Lizzie is trying to make her lives short because she wants to plan for empires she would normally not die this fast as we learned from x-life
Isnt every nook one life???
Finally an episode she doesn’t die
I still don't know how lizzie dies so much... shes on her last few lives... DONT DIE I LIKE THE NEW ONE plsssss
Omg so cute
Am I the only one who noticed Lizzie almost swear at 10:57?
Tower up and kill lauren with your laser eyes for killing you cause shes on her 3rd life just like you were when she killed you!!
Wow  That is a Awesome Thing You Can Do  And    That is   a Lot  of Awesome things You Can do
Oh  Dear
Wow
Wow  This  Place   Look Awesome
Wow  That is a  Lot   of Awesome things You   Can do IN the whole wide UNIVERSE
Wow  You  Are  Bard  You  Look A Parrat
Oooh A New   Vedo
Are the nuk thing about you origins episode's like the kangaroo and bird and the others
I CAN FLY!  Oops I now die.
Please stay as a enigma it's so cool but i think u whont fufil that promise😅
EVIL LIZZY IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ik the mystery between her house its the other oringens she was LOL IM GOOD YEAH THATS RIGHT
5 lives gone
Youre scaring me lizzy😭
lizzie u made parts of your house as all the things u where🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆
Each area in the enigma house is your previous lives on the server I am a genius.
Lizzie almost sweared😳😳😳😳
Can you Watch the after life song i love it and it is most of you in the vidio
I WISH YOU CAN STAY AS A BIRBBBB  FOR LONGER 🐥🐦🦜
when lizzie was decorating her base and designing the mysterious decorative walls i knew it was abt her old orgins and when she was finished with it I ACTUALLY KNEW ALREADY 😃 (i may have added a blooper 😭✋)
I feel like lizzie is gonna be the first one to be out in the afterlife server but we will see
Yaya didn’t die
nothing is better than waking up to a new LDShadowLady video🤍
Lizzie got a lover..              Death.
STOP DYING LIZZZZZIIIIIEEE!!!!!!!!
Aren't the nooks Lizzie's past lives?
"OH NO MY ONE WEAKNES!... BEING WEAK!"
What shader do you use??
I have noticed a small detail that some of you did not notice
*Birb*
PAN- PAN OMG PANNNNN
Do t go nether u will die
The nooks are all her other origins
This was probably the best content lizzie has created so far! I also love how you play into each origin perfectly!
I know what she was making in her walls as soon as I saw it she was making  the little areas all of the things she used or was I guess in the pass life
I have found out the mystery puzzle thing in your base but i shall not tell, i shall let other people guess what it is
You should join the league of villians with lauren!  Edit: did you kill Scott??
Lol she died in the first 50 secs
Lol birb? It’s suppose to bird😂 lol it’s kinda funny and Lizzie pls don’t die again I mean u can die bc we dont wanna be a villain 🥹
Ah yes, Lizzie is finally in her classic villain arc
I love how everyone takes the role of their orgins seriously and builds their personality in the game based off of it. (Spoiler warning) Like in this episode, Lizzie had a cute personality with a cute orgin of a parrot and with the enigma origin she turned into a villain that kills things.
this isn’t my idea but you should definitely live in the other peoples walls for the engima
I just love the part when she almost swear 😂
Lizzie: I went out of this world just as i came into it- in a hole Me: yes... it is fate
dont die plsssssssss
I have never felt more reviled that Lizzie survives as a specific origin for more than 1 episode
They are literally shrines to all of your past lives 😁
I hope she lives longer as an enigma
She's making all her deaths-
I’m surprised that you survived a whole new life an entire episode also Lizzie you need to be more careful if you don’t the afterlife series will end very quickly that’s why I’m worried so please try to be more careful
Lizzie you always made my day I just cried and I'm so happy after the video :D
Lizzy stop dying. Because I think you just put it on new just like a side empires as MP, but not really empires, so you can just relax.
I hope she remembers that she can go through walls
The knooks represent her last lives!
I love those Origins and they has a role and skills and they use powers and i like it and Lizzie skin is so cute and small like parrot skin and she died again because of the zombie.*Spoiler  Warning* she respawn and she has a New Origin and her power are dealy and villains and invisible to and she make her secret base inside in waterfall or mountain and I like all Origins. 😂🤣😘
in every episode lizzie dies
LIZZIE IS THE BEST!!! 😁😁😁
Lizzie in the next episode you should make a house so you don't have to be in the hole wide world with out a house
Hi LDshodowlady I'm your number one fan
is not a mistery if you die on all thet theam
I know what you're decorations mean lol
afterlife! the minecraft series where lizzie is a new species every episode.
so cute and mysterius house!
do thats why when i was gonna see her skin, i was so confused why it was all of her origins mixed up ._.
If I was her I would spawn the enderdargon and stare
The reason why Lizzie spawned in a desert is bc her bed was gone and her past life as a kangaroo made her spawn there
We just had to put down are cat Toby rip
I get it
Now this is the real definition of death stare
10:17 why do i always think of it as the bi flag
Lizzie rlly needs to get herself tougheter and not die i dont want her to leave so early 😭
Awe I was excited for bird Lizzie but her new origin is very cool!
i noticed that the decoration is all of lizzies other origins from the past
This is amazing!! 2 in one?!! Sucks that you died so quickly as a bird tho-
I love how she said the nooks in her house were top secret and could never be figured out when they're just a memory of her past lives 💀
All the little nooks is from Lizzie’s past lives witch I think everyone noticed lol
you know when she died I was sad but now im happy with her new origen
Play spore.
R.I.P. LDShadowBird Died from hole 2022-2022 You’ll be missed
Mystery is your lives
Lizzy! Racon  3  days Girl 🌺🌻🌼🌷🌹 2 days Uhhh i dont know what is thas 1 days Bird 0 days E? No it will never die
Me immediately, her last lifes on the server :o
Omg i am not first
Lizzie: Top secret headquarters! The mini map at the top of the screen: 👁👄👁
Room = each room/life u had
One minute it’s I CAN FLY! The next IM BEING CHASED BY A PIG!
Noice
the nooks represent her past lives, and I love that. Another amazing video!!
Lizzie can never catch a break with death in this series😭
Everyone can stare at an enderman but is you look away it will attack you
Why did it take you so long to post
...    That was a shortly lived life.
Ik the weird wholes are in her base are there her past life’s lol
the rooms are all lizzies lives she has been
You died straight away that origin was so coool
Poor Liz she is the only one to die so many times in the server. I hope she can survive this one.
they there all the lives lizzie has been
It from Lizzie’s past life’s I think
KİLL LAURENNNN
Lizzie is just speed running death at this point-
I feel like you're building a room based of your other origins, it's amazing
I'm pretty sure that those little nooks are to represent yr last lives,🙃
#6 on trending good job
hey lizze your map is showing where is your secret base
I think I now why you need a parrot it is to remind you of your origin and all the other corners to remind you of home and your origin
This video gives me anxiety on how close lizzie died here 10:58
I love the way Lizzie is enthusiastic about every origin she gets but I was kinda sad that she died at the starting of the episode but her new origin is so interesting! Subscribe or else pennywise will wake up under your bed 🤡😈
OMG THATS SO COOL EACH OF HER PAST ORIGINS ARE ON THE WALL!
day

You die so fast and so much
LIZZY PLS STOP DYING
Is the blindfold or whatever the thing is on the eyes is it to help with the staring thing?
THE PAN FLAGSSS YESSSSSS hehe I’m pan
What the f-  *BLAZERS IS THAT*
3 live left till you baned /dead for good dont die plz
The mystery is pretty obvious. The one with a sapling, a composter and a stick is the raccoon origin, the one with end stone and give in the wall is the floran origin, the one with slim in the floor and crystals in the wall is the humanoid origin, I think the one with the boat and cow heads with a cactus is the kangaroo origin, the one with a colorful wall is birb origin, and the library one is enigma origin.
So it w as true,  I love this episode.
The secret waterfall cave is for her past lifes?
I figured it out it's all your other lives!!!!!
I think the secret decorations are her past lives
Every little nook in her base is each of her past lives
Kingdomcraft all over again?
the decorations are like each of the lives you’ve had right?
Igigo is your dad going with me to help him
I love the mysteriousnes in her voice
just don't die again
Lizzies bird life lasted for about 2 min and a few secs
the rooms in her hause are the things she has dide as
<3
What the... f... blaze is that?!
I’m scared now :’D
SHe's gone as fast as she got there but she always get cute origin ❤ I love you Lizzie
The decorations are your lives you already had
i think the nooks symbolise her past lives!!
Challenge for liz:DONT DIE
Lizzy no xd
so cute😊 Btw i am using my dad's account😊
Lol i love thag base bc mh faviorte colour is orange
Join the evil group on the sever
ah yes reference to her past lives
The fact that she almost said f-
Lizze is decorating her interior based on her previous lives and houses so shall I be referred to as a problem solving expert??
The nokes and crannies are her past life's
The room represents all her different origins
Lizzie longest life was when she was a raccoon. Every other life has lasted barely an episode
If Lizzie keep dying in every eisode then Ep. 13 will be the last episode.
It's all the lives of lizzie! The decorations.
Lizzie’s here for a fun time not a long time
When you could fly
I think the little places in the walls was where she was when she died.
Lissie, you and Joel can both fly
I’m so sad the birb didn’t long Lizzie has 4 more lives left btw
LIZZIE, PLEASE DON'T DIE NEXT TIME...PLEASE
The decorations are all ur origins btw
i love how each little nook represents each life lizzie has lived ☺️
lizzie u need to stare at someone from a distance.. perhaps take down the most powerful person on the sever.. they’d never see it coming
This series is going to end so soon! Please don't die.
Cause we could call them LDshadowbabies!! <3
the nooks are her lives in her secret base.
Will you and Joel have kids? Or do you not want to have any?
Am I the only one who knows what the base decorations represent
A yes the secret nooks are such a mystery 😂😂😂😂
bird or dodo bird HMMMMMMMMMMM she died a lot so dodo bird
It’s sad that died so quick😢
The decorations is the memories of your pastilfes 😂😂😂 you got so many you can fill every corner 😂😂😂
Love birb Lizzie  Wooooooooooo May the anemo archon Guid your wings oh being of the air and sky Well…that didn’t work xd, rip hun, that was not fair xd Wooo an enigma ahhhhh
9:49 All of those are lizze's lives. Racoon, Floran, and  Goolian
Lizzie I love how small you are, it’s so cute!
she killed the brethren of her past self
“OMG, she’s a bird! Her skin is SooOoOoOo cute🤩!”  3 minutes later: 😐welp…
you scare me some times
so proud of u for only dying once lizzie
First thing I thought of when I saw the bird skin was the pan flag ✨ lol
I know the misteriest reasons it the places uve'd live
Your so good at die
I was exited for the birb but then-
they represent your lives
She likes her new origin and i like it too
I think the “mystery” little walls in your base is a represent your old origins:)
So Good UWU
Hmmm this is SooOoOoO hard to figure out.
OH I know! The crannies represent her lives!
I dont know id is the enigma origin or the deaths making her go co villian, Either way I want to warch the chaos this will unfold
Lizzie at the end of the episode:😈 The outro: ✨✨
Lizzy i know what your doing she is making every origen she was. Right lizzy.
Lizzie, I thought it is really mysterious if you had rooms with traps and maps of everyone's house!
PLEASE< PLEASE ULPOAD FASTER! I shared vids from you to my friend and I will BEG HER to sub you!
I have an idea- you could make a maze full of puzzles and riddles and let others do it.  There will be a grand prize, but the maze is deadly.
Ok so am I the only one who thinks her “decorations” represent her past lives. Btw I love your videos there so funny.
Am I the only one who thinks that Lizzie is hinting a little bit of… 🏳‍🌈?
I found out the meanings of the nooks! They resemble Lizzie's past lives!
Not Lizzie almost swearing at a pig 😂😂😂
I was like, yay bird! And then of course a stupid zombie came and ruined it 😒
✝️ *DON’T SCROLL. PLEASE READ* ✝️ But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them:  “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel: ‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams; even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.  And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke; the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.  And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.’  Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know— this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.  God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him, ‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope. For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption. You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’ Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.  Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.  This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.  For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.’ Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”  Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”  And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.”  So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. ‭‭- Acts‬ ‭2:14-41‬ ‭ESV
I love you videos pls make more than once a week 🤗
Uhm..there is a problem lizzie, you said it's a secret place and location, but I think the map exposed and betrayed you for keeping such secret
🦜
the furniture are the origins uve been isnt it?
Um the weird walls represent every single origin she had
aren't those based  on ur old homes
i think the secret nooks r her past lives
Your wall tell about your different origins right
liz.............. the mini map for ur base someone can figure it out
Are u bi lizzie?
Episode 9
LIZZIEE STOP DYINGGGGG YOU ONLY HAVE 5 LIVES NOW
Ah yes another day,another slay
Lizzie the Minimap, they know where you are because of the minimap😑😮‍💨
lizzie died at every episode T-t,
i like how the enigma had the colours of the parrot (and pan flag) on her sock thingy-  *just saying.*
THE DECOR MEANS HER PAST ORIGINS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Stop dieing ok
Lizzie: never let them know ur next move🤡😈😈
All of the decorations relate to her previous lives.
Lizze now have's 5 lives,I wish you the luck :D
I was screaming through the screen “YOU CAN TELEPORT USE ITTTT!?!?!?”
Hi lizzie i knew it you are a parrot yay Have a nice day and you never fails to make us happy
Might be crazy Lizzie's new origin remind me Discord form my little pony
Oh is your house based on all your life's? Bird and floran and more?

Did i just hear lizzy swear?
I get the little spots in the house
8:50 saving
You are  soo cute!!
I like how she based her decorations on her previous origi- *dies*
The birb thing was a tad bit freaky miss lizzy
lizzie’s lifes are so short
That quick she died smh
Lizzie decoration is just her past life
as soon as i saw the blue goo i knew each nook was for her lives!
Oh i know why she put the decorations looks like her past lifes
Lizzieee stop dying I don't want u to be the first to get banned!
I loved when she said ‘My OnE  wEaKnEsS iTs BeInG wEaK’
Some of the nooks resembles her past origins.
Imagine Lizzie being xornoth's right hand cause of her lives being so fast.
it's abviosly all of her past lives very clever and good idea
The mysterious  decoration  meant the lives she lived in the past like raccon,bird etc
I immediately thought u were making each nook with all the origins you've had so far its not really a mystery
The time you logged off your hobby was probably sneaking up/scaring joel while he was trying to sneak up/scare others
Lizzie chill 😭
I love ur content Lizzie! You are so talented and beautiful 🦋
All the little dents in the walls with decorations represents each one of her origins
i dont think solidarity will be the first to go ngl
10:57  she almost said the f word😂😂
And most deaths goes to….. Lizzie!!
She need to go to the heros bc she keeping on die-ing
The nuks are representing lizzies lives
Ldshadowlady: 1 life and x life  Ldshadowlady now:
theyre all your old origins i just realized (the decos in house)
The mystery in her base are lives
Lizzie Sounds like a sinister spirit has taken over when the episode ended
"dont speak to me or my son ever again" bryson classic villager line XD
I love your vids but can you please upload a little more because at the time of empires SMP you used to upload more but now you dont
I hope to see more of this origin I really like it but of course its not forever
ok this is just getting wierd
i hope you’re doing okay lizzie. it’s okay to take days to yourself <3 i’ve been watching you since i was 11 and i turn 20 next month! your fans love you and understand that sometimes you need to take a few days.
the coulors of the bird are pansexual!! UnU Im so proud
I hope you dont die again lizzie😭😭😭
Lizzy going crazy
WHAT THE FFF.......( Remembers she is a family freindly channel) blazes......
i was going to write "don't die lizzy " but she had alredy died
U DIE EVERY EPISODEEEEEE
we need shadowcraft 3.0 🙏
You should collect the heads of all who have wronged you in your past lives! (Like the zombie who killed you, a barracuda head, etc.)
What is the game name
Who else knows what Lizzies house means
Her base and her declarations represent her origins the most obvious one is the birb
i love how lizzie displays all her lives
the title says i can fly. 2 min in dies
Please don't die again 😭😭😭😭
I CAN FLY! A few Moments later I CAN'T FLY
Look at her mini map you can see the location 😅
Join the villains then back stab them                     revenge
There memory of her old lives
I feel like they are dying on purpose…dying way to much and don’t seem to really care that they do.
WOW! an episode of afterlife where she finally keeps her origin?!
Lizzie are u pansexual? Pink blue and yellow are the colours of the pride flag?!
I said to myself as soon as the episode started "Aw i love the bird origin I hope she doesn't die for a really long time"
Omg Lizzie your gonna run out of lives soon!
When you made the nooks I was like “uhm aren’t those your past origins?”
I’m pretty sure lizzie’s terrible at keeping secrets. and lying. and staying alive in this series.
before you make anymore base stuff or decor, i suggest making yourself as safe as you can. armour, defences, tools, etc. you can try to make allays with other similuar origins.
Omg- I love your vidss and 14 hours ago lets goooo- I enjoy all your vids!-
Lizzie cant u teleport?
This is so awesome
Are you ready kids? (Aye, aye Captain) I can't hear you (aye, aye Captain) Ooh Who lives in a cave in the water fall? (LDShadowLady)  who tryed to tame and killed the bird with the eyes (LDShadowLady)  If nauture did make no sense (LDShadowLady)  Then drop on the deck and flap like a bird! (LDShadowLady) ready?   LDShadowLady   LDShadowLady   LDShadowLady   LDShadowLady!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The decorations are all of your lives that you died with lol
6 on trending??? Not even for gaming!
How about join scott's team i mean the are villains
Imma be really sad if she dies as an enigma. Go lizzie!!
I thought Lizzie could teleport! Could she...?
I love how determined Lizzie is to play her roles, even when things go wrong and she dies. IM SORRY LIZZIE about the Birb mishap, it is very unfortunate.
I absolutly love the bird outfit!!
Uh lizzie u know everyone knows that u said the what the f- We dont care we love im subed have a good day :)
Aw, when I saw the title, I thought it was Elytrian. That’s my personal favourite origin. But bird isn’t bad  Edit: she lasted like, 5 minutes, and her new origin is cooler
I have never been so scared of lizzie
Finally
I figured out the decorations when the second nook of decor came up
NAH THE FLICKING AMEYTHIST I WAS SUBSCRIBED TO HIM IM PRETTY SURE HES ONE OF UR BIGGEST FANS!!
You take your videos for us seriously and gives the best of your ability to make great videos and your builds are gorgeous
Those mysterious nooks definitely do not stand for your past lives
They are your raccoon, alien, end floern, Kangaroo and bird. 🤓 Big brain moment :)
Subscribe if you love MrBeast❤
The decorations are the past lifes that she has lived
the puzzles are her previous lives
I don’t like this Lizzy this one is creepy. Go back to joyful Lizzy
I understand the puzzle?
ik
So I’m guessing the nooks are based on her past origins
Now i really hope this live of Lizzie can be the longest Lol
Stop dieng ok lizze stop just stop it
Lizzy, I know what the little rooms in your new house are they are little part of your orgins( house) you had played.
So the nooks are about the life of lizze one is the racoon 2 is the floren 3 is the glooien then the parot
It must be rough to be a Eigma when every mob hates u
okay SO- Life 1: Racoon Life 2: End Floran Life 3: Goop Life 4: Kangaroo Life 5: Birb Life 6: Enigma  ... am I missing anything???-
The Title should've been "I believe I can fly~ (still died again in 15 mins)
it frightens me how quickly lizzie can go from cute and adorable to scary and sinister
every time Lizzie post she ends up on trending we love uuuuuuuuuuuu
Lizzie pls stop dying we like this series and ur somehow already on ur 6th life😭😭
Doggy water UwU 😃😃😃😃🤪😐🤪😐🤪😐🤪😐🤪😐🤣😐🤣🤣😐🤣😐🤣😐🤣😐✨😐🤣🤣😐🤣😐🤣😐🤣🤣😐🤣🤣🤣😐🤪😐😐🤣😐🤣😐🤣🤣😐😊😍😣😍😣😍😣😍😣😍😣😍😣😍😣😍😍😍🏳️‍🌈😍💖😍💖💖💖🏳️‍🌈💖🏳️‍🌈💖🏳️‍🌈💖🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈💖💖💖🤤💖😣🤩😣😣😣🤩🤩😣🤩🤩🤩😣🤩🤩

I hate how the bird ended so fast
Woooooo
FINNALY SHE DOESNT DIE
Wait did anyone notice that she has a sorta pansexual coulur scheme with her sock?
I think it's obvious that her death was planned since she wanted to end the series early 😢
Fun Fact those little decor represents one of her past origins
Hi Lizzie, I love your videos. I love how every time you die you still come back positive. You should totally make an animal prison or testing lab since you can’t tame them, or maybe even sell them on the afterlife black market lol keep doing what your doing and have a great day🙃
Lizzie base is all about her other origins mystery solved
YOU NEED TO BE AN EVIL PERSON BY YA SELF!
Wait im so confused Lizzie are you pansexual??? (If you dont mind my asking)
This origin is really cool! I hope we stay like this for a while
Fun fact both my fav YouTubers ( you and drwwiffwaffles not counting Joel) post is same time 13h ago!
I was so excited for the bird though… oh well lol
This would probably make killing the ender Dragon lot easier
*Me casually watching this at 4:00am*My BFF:Asleep
oh i understand your decorations of blocks in the wall :)
Each nook is one of her lives
I love how every nook represents a past life
The 6 time omg
I know dos things it is your origin old origin
I would really like it if you posted the videos earlier in the week but alas, being a you tuber is hard so yeah! I love you Lizzy. Keep up the good work
SHE LIVES!!!!
All gamer with origins are so perfect but you 🤪🤪 are so dramatic and crazy [perfect] and you are only person in the server who died more than 5 times [OMG] save her
The mystery is that all those nooks are her past lives :)
I love her enigma base I understand it it’s all of her past lifes
maybe use a lead on the parrot?
As a enigma
You look like GE3TE3
I’m so sorry how many life’s doing have left?😂
that ending... *shudders*
You should upload videos more
why did you die?!
i love how lizzie dies like so many times and is still not rage quitting also they can see your cords
U r crazy u died more than 5 times You are gonna die and gonna kick out [hope it doesn't happen] omg u girl >...< Please save her
I love ur vids so much! (I just don’t my acc)
I was screaming when Lizzie almost said a curse word LOL
WHY DOES EVERYONE IN THIS SERIES THAT GETS A COOL POWER WANT TO BECOME A VILLAN?!👹
Why lizzie spawn at the desert well the game trys to spawn lizzie as kangaroo But the when lizzie dies as kangaroo the game make her spawn at the desert as birb
SHE DID NOT DIE THIS EPISODE YAYYY!!!🌷🍀🌸☀️
I thought Lizzie dose not curse she said the f word
Lizzie:oh no my one weakness “weak” Me:😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh no my one weakness, being weak 🥴😂🙂
The Enigma seems like a perfect rival to the Orb...
All the little cabby things in the set rat nook is alll your deaths in some sort of way I THINK
PLEASE DONT DIEEEEEEEE
“WHAT THE FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF BLUMMING HECK WAS THAT..
The little nooks are your other lives :)
It took you 2 month lizzzie!!!!!!!!!! 2 month
You'll have no lives left at this rate xD
"What the f-" *Realizes she's a family friendly channel* "Blazes"
10:57 Lizzie almost sweared 😱
Me:omg!!!! Lizzie has a new orgin :3 Lizzie:Diying every episode,
Are those each orange in new were
Each little nook looks like it represents each of the origins she has had :^
You die to fast
Ye Lizzie I dint think you are gonna survive this series
fanally lizzie din't  die
It takes 2 weeks to make these videos
Hehe I know your mysterys they are your orgins
Lizzie am sure that mysterious  room's is that was your first origin  and all of you's other origin haha😉
I really like the "decorations" I get what they are. They're your recent...you know
Ldparrotlady
the little nooks are your homes in your other life's, but it's coming along great, keep doing good.
The decor is all of her pass lifes
i love how Lizzie is just showcasing every origin on the smp love the vidz keep up the great work
I like she was like “ what the f- Blazes is THAT”
lizzie thats a nice pink-yellow-blue sock you have there
Day 7 of asking Lizzy to comment hello ♡    Lizzy you r the best you tuber ever and also the best builder, keep going I love your work sm <3 You inspire me.
I know why she has thous there her old houses/lives
Lizzie pls stop dieing i want to see u live more
Lizzie is speedrunning the smp-
Ok so I think for the secret headquarters the tiny rooms of decoration signify whatever lives and origins that she has had and the parrot 🐦 head was the birb .. Right?
The little nooks and crannies are each one of her previous origins I think
yea i’ll be your enigmaaa 🎶
Those nucks are all of the past lives of lizze
The places in the base are all her origins
she built a room of her past lives
finally she didnt die I'm proud
All the books are her past lives that’s so cute!!... and kinda dark at the same time
She's made a display of her last origins. I mean,  it just makes sense
lol she should totally join the league of villains (whats even more funnier is that she was the leader of the league of villains in her other SMP's)
I LOVE the fact that Lizzie has included all her past lives in her new home. It looks amazing 😻
I hope her and Lauren team up to be two evil rulers lmao. Even though Lauren did kill her it would be a cool team up.
That first death was stupid! Not fair you didn’t even spawn in spawn…
I found out her abstract art in 2 seconds it's all her old origins
Monument of died
I get it, it's all the life's you had before this one
It was a good episode but Lizzie you could have uploaded two episode by today...!? Still in shocked anyways I think you might have got some troubles to upload or even some problems. But I gotta say your videos are they best compared to others and you're the best!
The rooms are her past lives like the short bird
Lizzie's new avatar for her new origin literally has the pansexual flag on her sock🧦💗💛💙
I can't the out tro creepy Lizzie
Secret hiding place but you left the map open on screen
Will she die every episode? lol
2:20
The CHESS ♟ GAME IS OVER  I have the bad people in checkmate🙏 I need everyone to get behind me for these final moves!🧖‍♂️🙌
Lizzie is your house decorated in every house you used to have
I know what the mystery nooks are there everything she was
"...and join me next time where the mystery continues.." *BLASTING EDM MUSIC*
10:59 Lizzie did you almost swear?!
Omy i love your video aah
Lizzie please remember that you can faze through walls
I'm pretty sure the random nooks Lizzie created represent her past lives.
those little holes in your house must represent your past lives
Stop dying!
Ldshadowlady "What the fu- blazes" Me: Oh. My. God.
lizzie makes a cute parrot skin:*dying emmidietly*
the nook's lizzie has are her past lives! if you look closely each one represents what she used to be!!!
Im pretty sure the nooks represent each of her past lives
10:57 she almost said the f word 0.0
Oh! The nooks representing Lizzie's lives is so cute!
Am I the only one who saw the pan flag on her wing and on her foot?! On each new skin?! Someone please tell me you saw that too!
Congrats on #5 on trending
Lizzie: I just need to get a parrot...  Me: But... you can't tame things....
I FIGURED IT OUT! Your house is decorated by your different origins!
She is a birb not a bird
I love how every episode is a different life it's more entertaining
Please don’t die again
I'm gonna guess that the knucks are Lizzie's past origins
YES THE QUEEN HAS POSTED
?: what was your shortest life in this series? Lizzie: a parrot. Took like 2 minutes to get killed.
Great vid!!! I've been waiting for weeks for this episode and I love it :)
Mhm. Mysterious reasons of you are Base... it’s all of your lives
How many lives does she have
the nooks are little bits of her past lifes
did anyone not hear Lizzie almost say “what the f*ck!?” at 10:56 ?.. im aware that Lizzie is an adult and is able to say whatever they want but there are kids watching haha! You would forget that she’s a family friendly channel 🤣
Does anyone realise that she’s a ‘birb’ not a ‘bird’ THATS SO CUTE!
Lizzie: *Gets hit by a skeleton*  Also Lizzie: OH NO! MY ONE WEAKNESS!   Still Lizzie: *Pauses*  STILL Lizzie: BEING WEAK!  TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES  Me: *Dieing laughing*
3:01 and she lives up to her name
I do not want you to get kicked like x life You can do it Lizzie
2:15 in the video and Lizzy dies💀😭
The map sus
@LDShadowlady, you can see where your base is at 10:30 becuase of the mini map
I think I know what the crannies are! Representing your past lives! ( did i get it right?-)
i KNOW WHAT THEY ARE :) they are her past LIVes Yes only a genius should know :)
Anything is your orign I still love you. 💜💜💜👍
Spoiler:        Her decorations are her past origins I bet :o
The nooks are from all of the times you became things
Please, please, please, Lizzie stop dieing, I love this series😭
lizzie is a pro at dying teach me your secrets oh great and wise lizzie also the decorations are all of lizzies lives so far represented
Lol who else realised straight away that those (decorations) were her past lifes
For once she kept an origin for more than one episode!
All the little room nooks are like the origin houses that Lizzie’s been
Aha I figured it out the nooks are her past lives/homes (I think)
lizzy: stay tuned by the mystery continues...                 outro: WASAPPP
Ohhhhhh the decorations for your base are themed of your origins
The little decoration areas are all the origin she’s been
SHEEE UPLOADEDDD
I know how to die and keep your origin in this modpack!!! You also won't loose a life
AHHAHAHAH @theflickingamethyst this is You're fault joke😂😂😂❤🎉
I don’t know if anyones noticed it but the “mysterious nooks” are based on Lizzie’s past lives.
The wall areas are just her past life’s
Me after she died like 15 times already: 👁 👄 👁
At this point she is literally asking to die, plus it clearly says she can't tame anything yet tries to tame shit
What if you stare at the ender dragon?
STAWP LIZZIE UR SCARING ME
Lizzie, all the decorations in your 'misterious' home are memorials of all your past lives on the sever, very sneaky lizzie, very sneaky.
Everyone is turning into a villain   Gem be like 👁👄👁
STOP RPING
PLEASE STOP DIENG EVREY EPISODE
I don’t know if anyone else has realised it or if lizzie says it later in the video but all those “mysterious nooks” are based on her last lives :/
Oooooooooø
The nooks are all Lizzys past lives 😮
is anyone going to talk about how Lizzie was wearing something the same color of pan
Lizzie is so funny
Yes finally!
She based each nook on her previous lives
Is every little nook in your new secret base based on each of your origins?
Hi ldshadowlady im a fan of you i love all your videos 😊 by the way what mod are you using? I wanna now? 😊
It'd be cool if she made her whole lair a labyrinth like hallways that go no where or the place just being so disorienting
For a secret base its not the best kept secret           She lives in the mountain at spawn ;)
All of the nooks in her new base are representing her past origins. It clicked for me instantly.
If you guys don't know what the disign mean it's just what she use to be when she still was a racoon, Floren,part,alien and more
Lizzie the different areas are your previous life’s as a raccoon, a floran, a goolien, a kangaroo and the bird
I found out what all the decors are. Their of her past lives
Raccoon,Florian,goolian,kangaroo,parrot That was the theme of ur house
Hahah you fell in a hold the first day as a bird
Lizzie you should be more careful Because you only have 3 more orgins left before you get banned from the server.
The nooks are decorated based on her origins
ratio
CAN YOU PLEASE STOP DYING?? I really miss that End Home you made and every death makes me miss it more ;-;
Anyone else getting Leauge of villians Kingdomcraft vibes?
“WHAT THE F- blazers IS THAT?”
Me hoping Lizzie doesn't die Again   She dies again
10:58 you almost said a cuss word lizzie.
Aren’t those mysterious nooks for Lizzie’s past lives…?
I think the four little rooms are represented her origin s as a raccoon, floran, goglien,and a bird❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
the nooks are based of her previous origins lol
Lizzie you should take a revenge and kill Lauren with your new abilities
OH THE  ITEMS  are for each origins 🦝💐👽
what the fu- WHAT IS THAT!?!
Thats all youre origin in afterlife
The nooks were all of the lives of her and the server
She put a room for every life she had
Lizzes nooks are based off her past lives…sooo cool!
Ldshadowlady! My first comment ever is on your work! I'd been watching you for a long time and I love your work here. You've been so great to so many.
Lizzie has to have rewards for this episode.   1. Reward for being the best at dying.    2.  Reward for surviving one episode.   3.  Reward  for Not swearing unlike one person (joey).    4. Reward for being able to build a house/shelter.
...
When One Theory was almost Correct:
I k that Lizzie know how to always be killed
Lizzie just missed the villain squad :(
I know the mystyruis nuke mystery they are her past lives
Wow rlly
Lizzie: Death be SLOWLY WITH YOU  *FLashbacks*  *Every Episode of Joey DEATH BE WITH YOU*
1:20 “ yea this seems unimportant👌😌 “  Zombie: I’m about to end this man’s whole career
wow she actually ended an episode without dying
How many lives has Lizzie gone through? She’ll probably be the first to reach 10
yay
THING THIS IS I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPISODE FOR SO LONG I ‘THOUGHT’ YOU WERE NOT GOING TO DO AFTERLIFE NOT MORE BECAUSE THE OTHER EPISODE WAS LIKE 4 OR 3 AGO SOOOOOO THANK YOUUUUUUU! ✨😍✨🌺
Spooler alert: I think the walls of Enigma Lizzie's secret headquarters represents her different lives...
OMG DID YOU JUST ALMOST CUSE?!
All those nuks are your lives that you lost
her little nooks represent each one of her origins
10:58 She thought wisely abt what to say - LOL
So how many time has Lizzy died now?
Lizzie someone predicted your new to origins they might be a fan of you I forgot if they are a fan of you and they we're right about your new origins
LIZZIE YOU CANNOT  TAME
I’m scared
... the mysterious thing was each wall represented a past life, pretty easy tbh
“What the f-   Blaze’s is that”
Please no more dieing btw you should make a  garden as your house
Lizzie “Can do twice as much damage when flying,”  Also Lizzie, “I can’t kill this zombie,” walks into a hole, doesn’t boost fly out and is killed by said zombie. F 😂
Do you even know you have one life to live?
Ldshadowlady i love your vedio
If y’all could not figure it out the comers were to rassemble each of her lives
i was wrong but its ok
Why does here 2 orgin remind me of the collector
lizzie  if you stay like this maybe you can make your own biome and dont trust anyone i love bye
You wouldn’t have died if the spawn wasn’t messed up that shouldn’t count
Lizzie nooks are representations of her past lives. (What I think)
I was already expecting her to die this episode but not when it's 2 minutes into the video 😭
I think they things in her base are all her old life
Lizzie ur the only one that dies fast
OH each little decoration is for each life
Pls make more after life videos I love them
I have been watching her YouTube videos to the next video for this one of after life
Is lizzie ganna die every episode? Lol
She does like every episode and it’s awesome to see all the unique origins and what the theme of the next build is XD
All those mystery’s are Lizzie’s past powers I Cracked the code!!
When people spoil their next origins by checking the youtuber's  skin ;-;
Oh lizzy did you know that if you just stare at an enderman and not look away it doesn't attack cuz its sorta weird
thecreepy voice at the end
bRuH
I clicked faster than the speed of light, I’ve been waiting forever!! :D (I found out the secret of your base decor.. >:)
R.I.P lizzie the kangaroo and parrot
Some off those umm holes IDK are representing your old lives. Anyways love u
Wait I think the things is representing the deaths of her like the red one for the racoon and the rainbow one for the birb
World record?
Lizzie killed a pig and allot of pigs are killing her
Her voice at the end scares me😰
Kangaro boat ,golien ship ,floren end flowers, birb head ,enigma room , racoon trash
This time be careful Lizzie ok
Me when Lizzie died: AUDGEUQGSHF HEHWGEHDVCHWJGCUDHWHXGjxkw b r
All the decorations in her house might represent her past lives :0
The Decor is ur past houses!!!
I am gonna out Lizzie THOSE NOOKS R HER PAST LIVESSSSSS Y'ALL
I know the mystery of the room is it every origin you have been?
i am scared.
so its kinda oviouse the decorations are lizzie's past origins! such a cute idea
well that was shortlived
title: i can fly lizzie: dies within 3 minutes of the video
@ldshadowlady you could work with lauren I mean maybe just maybe the 2 of you will be like joker and harley your joker while she will be harley just saying
The nooks represent her previous origins, right?
Yesssssss she did not die yaaaaa🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
IM SO EXITED I HAGVE NT WATCHED IT YET BUT I BET ITS AMAZING
Lizzie: This is the most beautiful biome I've ever seen! The end city a few episodes ago: Am I a joke to you?
I love your videos and i hope you don’t run out of lives! I would really like more of this.
I wish This Origin Will Last Longer Than The Birb Origin
will we ever have a lizzie episode of her not dying?
Yay I was waiting for this!
Fun fac those mini rooms are her past life! I instantly knew that when i saw the alien room
Lizzie has a new origin for every new episode
ALREADY!?!?!?
Finally
im i the only one that saw the pan flag in her birb outfit?
Lizzie I’m begging don’t do what you did In kingdom craft where you gave your whole base away😭😭☁️☕️
You could have flew out of the hole
Me on 1min of the video do not die in this vid plz ahahhaahha
1st life: 3 days, 2nd life: 2 days, 3rd life: 1 day, 4th life: before she could properly end it, 5th life: before she could get a single item. I'm starting to see a pattern here that I'm not so sure I like.
What the f- …Blazes that!? Nice save Lizzy 💀
Lizzie says that her base I so mysterious and she literally has a world map showing exactly were she is
Im loving your mysterious villain arch!
people thought you were going to be controlled by xornoth when u actually are an enigma
Scott: *mysteriously dies* me: LIZZIE, Lizzie lisse we know you killed Scott sure he was a villain but he changed! those particles around him just lead to the murderer being you. see you in court!
Are they themed to be your last origins?
you doble died like jole
all the little nooks represent all of her lives hehe. not that puzzling tbh lizzie
wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
Noooooo not the birbs!!!
What the fu-  Bluming
Lol your walls are your old origins! Super cute idea!
her voice change when she was the eigma
I want nothing more than for this to just be an excuse for Lizzie to be full chaotic evil for as many episodes as possible
I your videos and I love you so keep it up lizzie
The walls were your old origins so cute!
Please don’t die this time 😭
WHAT THE F-  BLAZERS IS THAT
You could have just used a lead to catch the bird and bring it home
lmao love that you know that people are spoiling your origin. I hate that people are doing that, it ruins the surprise of knowing what origin you'll be next
Ykw I know what the weird decorations are for .... They are for all the life's you had and what you been...
7:30 you can see Lizzies skin has a pan flag sockkkk!! It’s a neat detail and I love it
Try the cloning ability so you'll go invisible
All of the nucks are for her other live she did
STOP DYING!!!!
Nooo, I can’t wait another 3 weeks for the next video
Lizzie's house mystery just shows her previous lives.
Lizziw just inspired her walls with all of her past origins
PLEASE STOP DIEING
I Think I Know What The Mistery Decorations Are! It’s All Her Origins She’s Had
Lizzie nearly said the F word when she was in the Jungle lol
If you stare at a enderman dont look away
I think I know what the nooks in her base are. Are they all her past lives? E.g the bird one is her parrot life.
You should make a shield 🛡 also I love your vids 🌸🦋🐘
u can stair down an ender man but can u stair down a lauren?
❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 LED shower lady I think you should know that house in the next video
I love how some of the decoration areas  are like your old origins, that's a good idea
I think your decorations are adorable! Are they from all 5 of your past origans?
YAY u posted  I am a big big fan I love ur vids and pretty builds!
I feel like Lizzie needs a training arc 😭 as nice as I want to be, she’s losing her lives WAY too quickly. She needs pvp training, survival training, and maybe some mental training (learning not to panic)  I think it’d be really cute to see some sort of anime-style training arc!
All of the the weird things she has build in her house are memories from her past life, like the slime, the slime is the memories of the goolin, and the honey and the end stone is the end floren.
I thought it was cute how lizzie decorations are her lives
I love how each area is one of her old orgins!
welp didnt fly for too long
She has died nearly every episode
LIZZIE NO
Yay! (Spoiler) An episode where it doesn't end in Lizzie's death!
I don't think this was on purpose by any means, but there were so many pansexual flags throughout this video and I loved it
Lizzie is MADE to be a villain. Especially since she's insane now.
I think I understand what the random off-coloured spots in her base is! Each and every one of them are different and unique, they resemble her past origins!
I fear our Lady of Shadows has gone quite mad.
Please get good armor!!!
* mysterious ending *    * cute outro
"you can ride any players, I CAN'T WAIT!"  Me: 😳
Lizze your a mrstery or so your skin
RIP
There erase that her lives
Your Xhornoth
Lizzie could you try and stay alive for more then one episode because this will be only ten episodes!💜
Lizzie I know why you decorated like that
It's surprising that Lizzie didn't die in this episode
STOP DIEING OMG
Fighting the zombie was Lizzie's worst decision xD
All of Lizzie’s decorations are references to her past origins
I think all of the nucks in the wall repesent her past origins
lizzie literaly anything you do scares me now cuz i expect you to die XD
LIZZIE STOP DIEING PLEASE!!!
I know what is Lizzie is doing on the “decorations” 🦜
Wait, what was she gonna say? 10:57
Lizze your mrstery is easy you've made rooms for all your past life's
The decoration is your past origins
Birb and other thing
LIZZIE YOU ALMOST SWORE
LIZZE FRIGGIN CREEPY
I know the mystery for the new base
Ahh finally a episode u don’t die 😁
Lizzie: I am bird! Also Lizzie: I need a bird Also Lizzie: I K I L L B I R D
I know why she built the gooey thing it’s because where she lived and died
Its a pansexual flagggg on the wings! ❤
O,how I love parrots
So exighted for next ep🎉🎉
THAT WAS SUCH A CREEPY ENDING
This is from all your different lives
Pls don't daed again
I cracked your wall mystery- it’s decorated with all of your lives 😏
guys! all the nooks are based off her last lives!!!
Hi lizzie
Lol the walls represents her old lives I'm good at puzzles lol
Starts episode as parrot who dies. Ends episode by killing a parrot. I feel like there's some poetic irony here.
Maam you forgot to turn off the mini map while you were in the "secret base" XD
Our queen
I feel like this is lizzies redemption arc
WHAT THE HELL LIZZIE U DIED AGAIN😭
the nooks are your past lifes
I love how you decorated some of your past life
I want her to stay one thing for longer than one episode but it’s entertaining too
I already knew!
What mod is this it cool:)
Your pink Paradise omg so cute lol
Aww I was excited for a parrot but the enigma is so cool!
Lizzie: these nooks mystery yes mystery  Me: ITS ALL YOUR LIVES LIZZIE
pink yellow and blue huh reminds me of pansexual
Each little hole represents each of her lives so far. 🤪 So am I the genius Lizzie?
I love how Lizzie instantly forgot one of her abilities to phase through blocks every single time she was in danger and could have just phased through the floor or something.  Also using that ability would make her hideout even more hidden if you have to phase through to get to it.
The moment that Lizzie realized that she can’t tame a parrot 🤣
I see what you did there. Very smart
Are the nooks for her past lives?
Raccoon for 3, floran for 2, gollien for 1, kangaroo for 1, parrot for a 12th, and enigma going forward.
wait, the uhhh, different sections in her base represent her previous lives right?
She is a parrot because she spawned next to a jungle
So amazing luv it
im so confused..
1. Raccoon  2. End floran  3. Goolien  4. Kangaroo 5. Birb  Lizzie stop dying 😂 I'm sorry whoever's portal is that but you have a new guest and his name is death  hahaha
It’s not a bird it’s a ✨Brib✨
Lived for 3 as a raccoon  2 as a flower  1 as a alien Half as a parrot  Engima unknown
the parrots... im sad now
I just realised that in her house it was all of her old origin 😅
All the nooks are all your origins
I know what the nooks are based off of :>
I have solve the riddle the decorations in your house represent all your lives including the parrot
Lizzie dies every other day
Lizzie you coordinations are show where you are in the top corner
Lizzie you coordinations are show where you are in the top corner
Lizzie you coordinations are show where you are in the top corner
I realized before that the nooks were to resemble your past lives. It’s a clue of the owner
Her base reminds me her kingdom craft base on the nether roof where she fooled most of us that watch it
i swear birb was the best life to match lizzie
lizzie don't you be the first one to end this series. these vids make me so happy tho, no matter how weird it is XD Edit: YOU TOTALLY SHOULD JOIN THE VILLIAN GROUP
Only 2 minutes in LIZZE
The little places in the wall are all the different origins you had
She can join the cute club🤩
Omg amazing 🤩
I mean it’s not like parrots live that long in real life ether
lizzie, PLEASE STOP DYING!!!!!!!!!!!!😭
Ldshadowlady has lost her mind!!
The decor is your past life’s! So cool
I think those mystery decorations Is Lizzie's past lives
All of the nooks were all of her lives
OKAY REALLY STARTING TO SEE A PATTERN
her mysterious rooms are themed by her past origins everyone knows that right
FINALLY LIZZIE DIDN'T DIE!
Every lizzie in her past lives im gonna survive untill the end! Lizzie dying every life she has ;-;
Easy it is all your past lives
the lair is the things that killed her and what origens she had anyway love her vids she makes them sooo great
does trying to find a desert then spawns in one
hahah
I knew she was a parrot
I think you spawned in a desert because Kangaroos are supposed to spawn there. So the mod code has you spawn there after you die as a kangaroo, assuming you'd stick to the origin.
Idea:You should add a wall with heads of mobs you have killed in your house  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Watching Lizzie’s AfterLife SMP is like watching Re:Zero.  You know the main character is probably dying soon. Again,
i love this season so much. i was shocked when you died in every episode cause you never die:D. And when is saw that you became a bird i loved the avatar
Asking for another song cuz I loved Deal with destiny day:1
You  Should get a Second chance at the birb cus that life was way too unfair :(
The colors 💓💛💙
The nooks in her house where to represent her past life
Each nook or little room represents each of lizzis individual lives
all of her wall decorations are to represent all her past lives
Is her past lives
Why Do you always get the best origins?! ;D
Her headquarters is all of her origins it’s so cool Good Job!!!
Spoiler:  THE ROOMS REMIND ME OF HER PAST ORIGINS!!!!!!!!! IS IT JUST ME?   The floran origin is the one with the pumpkins and beehive and other stuff, the raccoon origin is the one that looks like her first house, the space alien origin is the one with the amethyst and rods, the kangaroo origin is the one with the boat and cow heads (because of her pranks), the birb origin is the one with the bird head which is why she needed it, and I don’t know about the rest. (I know I got some of the names wrong)
lizzie why did you try to kill neather mobs the neather mobs are already dead you can only kill them again with wepons
When Lizzie is like noo i like this origin dont kill me...
Okay hear me out I think all those random decorations on her base Are like her old Origins
Pls don’t die
Lizzie: I can fly! Also lizzie: **dies the first 3 minutes of being a bird **       (Edit: i dont care how old this comment trend is im still doing it)
spoilor: the little thingies in her house are her past lifes
This is when Lizzie takes over the server and kills everyone else. It did say entities meaning players too
I think that the weird decorations are all of your past lives 🫧🌸🍬✨
I really felt sad that you died right away as a parrot, cuz I really love birds and you looked cute :’ D
i all those nooks are her orgins
( spoilers ) I find it ironic that she died last episode looking for the desert, and when she respawned… she was in the desert
The decorations are based on every origin she had. I noticed it right away lol.
Yay not left on cliff hanger!
Lizzie has a tendancy to be the first one out of the game
I bet Lizzie will not survive four episodes without dying❤❤ 😂😂
Please join villain club
Every episode I say I hope ldshadowlady survives at least a few episodes yet she dies twice in one-ARGHHH
She have became a demon!?
Oh no my one weakness being weak-Lizzie 😂2022
The fact that she almost said “what the f*ck” is suspicious.🤔
How dahell she die
on the walls of your new secret base, are minature versions of your past lives, being the raccoon, floran, goolien, kangaroo and birb
Me before the video even starts: Lizzie, PLEASE survive for more than just one episode this time… *SHE DIDNT EVEN SURVIVE THE FIRST TWO MINUTES*
I think the nooks resemble your previous origins.... it’s kinda obvious
FINNEY idk how I’m lazy y posted
Her base is soooooo secretive!! 🤫 Hint: Life
Each room is her former Origen
The stuff in the little nooks are her past lives
*By this point, I’m absolutely convinced she dies on purpose each episode*
Pansexual pride flag
Every single decoration thing in her houses is all the lives she has experienced
join matiral girl evil incoreprated founded by the shadow woman thare goul was to exterminate all of the daywalkers on the server but now the goul is to destroy the server the book of everyones weakness's is in the manor of vampire scott but be careful becuse Scott's cheach overlooks the manor you will have to get it when he is offline also lauren is the only other villain on the server but she is no longer enderman by the way Scott is the angal origin and beware the garudens of the afterlife
Isn’t it cute and funny that every time she sees a cute biome she says this is the cutest biome I’ve ever seen😂❤❤
I know what those nooks are there little memories of your previous lifes
Mam you put your past live in the wall
Lizzie you kept the mini map on in your base
THAT FACT THAT YOU DIED I WAS LIKE :the ep is already over? you: RESPAWNS me again : WA-okay doesn’t matter : you have super powers : me AHH YESSSSS FINALLY you almost dying to another pig me again : TP ALREADY you: few seconds later OH WAIT I FORGOT I HAD SUPER POWERS you when you want a parrot : Oh wait I can’t tame anything me : you forgot that already? You : WELL IF I CANT HAVE A PET I HAVE A IDEA (sorry if I said it wrong) you * kills every parrot u see until you find head * me THATS EVIL me again : oh wait she’s like barely good in her sires ( sorry if I spelt it wrong ) you sound at end sounds mysterious
her colors are my sexuality😭
lizzie- are you going insane-
the decorqtions resembles of lizzies 1 hour lives :)
u died in the first 10 minutes of playing haha but u were VERRRRRRRY cute
I’ve been waiting so long🎉🎉🎉❤❤
Oohhhhh,I get it,lizzy has those things/"mystical ressons" which is her Reswans as a different animal/characters
This is a series of watching lizzie die every episode
I have a feeling those little books are for her past origins
i love how lizzie gets the cutest roles but dies right after instantly 😭
The tings in the walls repercent her past lives ;-;
all of the little things in your house are just the afterlife things you have been at different times
"What the f- ...  Blazes is that?!"
Btch idk what’s happening this series is fun but so inconsistent 😭😭😭😭
when r u next gonna post ep 9
You fricking took soooooooo long n I loooooove your vids
Good Luck On Your New Life! I Know What Each Like Box Are Every Life! Your Death Might Arrive Sooner Than You Think. Also Love Your New Mystery Base! 😊
is no one's gonna talk about Lizzie Almost SWEAR??
Imma just be here knowing her "mistery" decorations
I was so worried because you were not posting
Have a steering contest with a enemies
The books are tributes to her past lives.
Ive been waiting for your new videos lizzie
10:55 what the f-- lizzie what was that😏
Yay you didn’t die for once!
The sections in you base are themed after you previous lives
LIZZIE PEOPLE ARE SPOILING YOUR ORIGINS
I am really looking forward to see Lizzy teleporting behind others or snipering from afar and people being confused.
i loved the enigma and it’s always gonna be my fav origin. and is the order of the decorations your origins?  she’s more transparent that the gooolien  recommend not going to the end to much people died there
I... had a feeling that bird Origin wouldn't last long, but I didn't expect it to go _that_ quickly 😂  But dudeeee the enigma Origin seems so cool 👀  Edit: Oh I see what you did with your hideout 👀
She lasted like I dunno 2 minutes
Is your house near spawn? I think i can see it in the mini map
It’s empire Lizzie’s pet parrots backstory
The decorations are each of your deaths. The bird, alien, raccoon, so on. 🙂
10:00 the deco’s are the past lizzie lifes
That was some creative decor doing your old lives love the vids
yup
I love how her house decorations are based of all of her previous origins <3
Creepy
Not bird birb
10:05  Is the mystery that you put all of the themes of your lives in the pits?
LD: what the ffff***
NOT AGAIN!
She has to live longer pleaseeee!
Loved it, 10/10
She created a nook for every origin she had!!!omg Lizzie ur amazing!!!
I'm hoping Enigma Lizzie stays alive for a few many more episodes!
Are the mysterious decoroations your past origins
Most of those tiny wall area when u said u needed a bird made me reals that those walls are your death of what u have been
The Little nooks are her past oragins
8:38 So just saying here are we going to ignore the Map on the high left corner of our screens?
Is your secret waterfall the one at spawn
Guess I'm a genius and a problem solver cuz those nooks are her old bases prolly cuz I'm a introvert
why does lizzie saying "its perfect" in the end make me uncomfortable
THE DECORATIONS ARE LIZZIE’S PAST ORIGANS!
A like!? I will leave something... but what it is will be a Mystery! muahahaha. Great vid :)
Hi lizzie im a MASSIVE fan im subscribed and i love your videos pls feature this comment in your next video <3😀
I love that its so obvious to everyone that it is decorated for her other origins but lizzie is pretending its secret!🤣
Lizzy can u pls start uploading ur vids qicker plsssss I love u lizzy ur the best I’ve watch all of ur vids
What the fff— blazes! Hahahahah
I like how the walls are based off of her previous origins. This is gonna be a cool life that will hopefully last for more then 1 episode!
SHE JUST KINDA REVEALED THE LOCATION OF HER BASE
ooo! This is definitely not what i expected Lizzie to pick. I’m so excited to see how this plays out, and how long Lizzie can stay alive
i feel so bad you dide 2 times
Lol Lizzie’s “Decorations” are actually representing her past lives
Omg how did you die again 😭😭
You spawned in a desert because you were last a kangaroo that’s natural spawn point is in a desert
who else knew the mysterious decorations straight away
Yes I love these your a parrot now
Lizzie for life
Lizzie you should fight Lauren since she killed you and I’m pretty sure she’s your least favorite Noh enderman
You mean you deaths is your secret in your hideout
Never let them know your next move😏
OMG CUTEEEEE!!!!! I LOVE UR BIRD SKINN I WISH I COULD HAVE ITTT!!!!!😍😍  But it didn't last verry long
I love your videos Lizzie! :) I have watched every single one of you’re videos and it’s all thanks to my cousin who introduced me to you and Joel.
What the F- blazing is that 😭
I thought u was gonna die at the very end again
My theory was correct! She's a birb  Nope she died
The little nooks are a Of her old Origins like the rainbow one is for her parrot
Lizzie has gone a little mad. Don’t you think so too? Also happy happy unbelated birthday
Finally you didn’t end up dieting at the end of the video
10:58 lizze almost drops an F bomb
When Lizzie’s the colour of your pride flag (as a bird): 😳
What's with the evil mysterious music at the end? I'm very much intrigued! Don't die please!
Me when Lizzie died to that zombie: 😑
you should stare down everyone in the server
When she was reading I love how It said birb  and not bird
I need to see Lizzie prank other players with this origin.
Did anybody realize the creepy music at the end or was that just me?  Also i love this
10:58 lizzie nearly sweared
Coooooool
10:57 What was that lizzy?
The rooms are all her previous lives
I get it!All her nooks are her past lives!
The fact that her base is in a super secret location but you can see the map in the left corner of the screen😂
All I’m saying is just don’t…DIE
So no one gonna talk about how cute lizzies new skin is? It's literally reprents every orgin she's been!  The blue stuff on her hands = Florian  The socks The parrots and kangaroo  The eye mask is the one she js right now!
It’s nice that she made shrines to her old lives in her new base
Lizzie you forgot the little map on the left-hand corner, someone could easily find where you are!  Even though you did hide the coordinates someone could still find it based on the image!
Oof I just watched it before she got the idea💀💀💀
Oh and lizzie or eny one else tell me the mods you are using because my mincraft is really plain i know youv allready done one but i would really love it if you just qickly add it in a future video  Thanks anonymous  person
You should just get a bird head you are a villain after all
She put decorations from her previous lives in her house!
.... can lizzie go a episode without dying i skipped to the end to see if they died saw nothing began watching and ----- wel  bleh death
Parrot skin= has pan flag❤ Other skin; has pan flag as sock🌸 One base corner; has pan flag😍😍😍😍😍
I think she pretty much is dying every episode for the outfits haha
The rooms are her past lives
wait wait pan flag ? 7:31
I know why she put those decorations in her base it’s because it’s everything she’s played as before I got it in like 2 secs lol
what is it called
Just wow
The rooms are based off of Lizzie's past lives
Wow
I like how Lizzie won’t say what the books are but they are just to represent some past lives
Each nook represents a life
I think this is what the nooks represent  I think they represent her past powers like that one had honey and flowers representing the floran and the one with he colored wood and the bird stuff represents birb.
And also now, LdEnigmaLady!
I have solved Lizzies puzzle. I know why she put those random things in her house, but I will not reveal it.
I think all her decorations corners are all the origins she's had 🤔
No more birb
All I know is that the secret base is all of her origins up till now
the decorations are each life she had the one with the parrot is the parrot life the one with the red and the stick in a frame is racoon I think the one with the pumpkin and the flowers was the flower life ( forgot the name) and so on This is what I think
Is she making her past lifes in the nooks lol
10:53 I swear Lizzie almost swore
The mysteries of her past lives
Your old lives
Think your base is the origins you died as, like the slime alien
Each nook is based off one of her origins i love it!
We had LdRacoonLady, LdFloranLady, LdAlienLady, and LdKangarooLady, And now, LdBIRBLady
Lizzie kanga had so much potential love you lizze
Dis anyone else notice how Lizzies outfits today involved the pan flag? Just me? Okay
YOOOOOOOOOOO
I think she forgot all her other powers to escape the mobs lol
I wanted you to stay a bird
The little nooks are like definitely not memorabilia from her last life’s like totally not
I just realized it was a shrine for each power she had
LEAGUE OF VILLAINS THE SEQUEL SOLO MODE
I’m pretty sure those little nooks she made were of her previous origins which is actually so cool and a good idea. ♥️
Omg lizzie you should become a villain! wait .. nvm
Oh! I see what you did there, you used all your past origins and put them in each wall! Cool!
I love the fact she thought we couldn’t find out that she based her bases of her dead origins
She says the decorations are a mistory but is her past origins
I understand the little slots their her past origins🤯
the way how lizzie almost sweared loll
Bruh
How she held in that f
Hi Lizzie, love your videos keep up the good work
its all here origins (her nook and crannies)
I love how it shows on the title that shes a birb, but she turns into a enigma.😂😍
The nooks are based off of every origin Lizzie has ever had :D
Ummm anyone else concerned for her sanity cuz she sounds a little crazy up yk just a little
I totally know the mystery behind the decorations it's all about the different origins lizzie got!!
So the mysterious decorations are actually shrines to her original origins birb, goolien, raccoon, end florist and kangaroo just for those who didn’t notice 👁👅👁
i love whenever lizzie has a villan arc! she's just so good at it!
the ''secret'' is the house is all her past lifes. it was rather easy to guess
0:15 your a "birb"? Lol
The mysteries are little diagrams of her past lives
I love outfit so much, Lizzie!
You die every episode!
I understand the stuff/nooks
Ohhhh the mystery is all your deaths lol
How about lizzie makes a throne out of tinted glass and puts a sign above it saying "Mysterious throne"
The  coners of weird stuff it represents all her deaths in afterlife.
On the thumbnail she's looking to the side in her parrot form
You look so tiny you will make great friends with the fairy that is Katherine
Finally u took like 2 weeks I was so bored without u
The amazing origins tho
I will actually be so sad if Lizzie loses all her lives too soon 😭 i feel like her lives are going by way too fast for my liking
Each nook in her secret base is one of her origins
Lore for Lizzie’s enigma: She was reborn after being killed by a zombie with horns of a demon . And she had goey hands from her goolein self. Wanted two socks that were her birb color, and wanted a kangaroo sock. Found the torn remaines of the Florian outfit when she went to the end, and she soon realized her eyes were freakish and killed everything instantly. So she got a mask that reminded her of her first life to conceal her eyes energy so everything at her glance didn’t die. She felt hatred toward everyone by instinct. She tried to join the villains but they thought she was too much of an enigma. She developed hatred towards other life forms, and now wants to destroy the rest.
I literally love how Lizzie has so many houses but then she dies and gets a new role
Lizze girl  LIVE FOR MORE THAN LIKE 3 EPISODES PLEASE.
Lizzie almost said a bad word 😭
Lizzie is the definition of never let them know next move
Great video LDSadowLady.  I have a thairy that the decorative areas symbolise passed life on the after life smp.
Ahhh yes all of your pat lives
The corners represent each of her origins
INA WAY SHE SURVIVED
Who else had a mini heart attack when Lizzie almost swore?
SHE SURVIVED
The mystery is the crechers you have been
Does Lizzie not no that she can go through walls
Pigs are one day going to take over the world. Yep I might be crazy but I sure did call it!
it is ur past lives lizzie it is not a secret
OMG, i've been checking "ld"just to see if you posted a new vid after school, because a great video makes the food taste better <3333
Did Lizzie have pan flags on her pants? Is she coming out?(/pos) Oh my gosh, she's so cute, I love her
Guys in the video if you go to 10:58 then you will see the Lizzy almost said a bad word but didn't
the music at the end makes me believe ldshadowlady will actually be the one that survives the longest and will be tricking everyone but that's just a theory a game theory
I think she should join the dark league (the non-sun people)
I think the decorations are her past lives
Lizzia you need to be more careful or you  will be the first one out of the sever
I know what she did for the open bits she put all of her Origins that she has been
the rooms are her past lives!
Don’t die
Me and my best friend are big fans on your channel and watch you constantly talk about your most recent episodes and you make us laugh ❤️ and we are always speculating about your next origin. 💗
They would never be all of your past lives you know the mysterious things
AYYYYY FINALLYYYY AN EPISODE THAT LIZZIE DIDN'T DIE ONNNNN
Idea, what if you try to stare the ender dragon to death??
All of your noocks are all of your lives
aaaiiiiieeeeeaaaa pansexual parrot we love we stan
7:44 joels hole from crazycraft?
Those are lizzies past origins right? At 12:50
I bet that the nooks are abt her past lives and she almost cursed lol
Try ginshin impact! It’s a game with amazing graphics , and an outstanding story , and it’s really cute!
Finally Lizzie survived one day!!
I know! It’s all of your past lives!
{Spoiler}  Lizzy kinda need to change the title to “i could fly”
I think the decorations in her base enigma base are either supposed to represent either all her origins or the ways she died
She truly scares me 😂
I like how the decorations reflect on her past life’s
“You wanna fly, you got to give up the shit that weighs you down.” ― Toni Morrison, Song of Solomon
I know my Lizzie created the little nooks they are to honor her past after life origins
wait i didn’t finish this ep yet so i don’t know if she said it but the nooks are her past lives right?
POV you know what her secret decorations in her house :>
Also i solved your mystery. It’s every origin you’ve been
“What the f- blazes is that?”
shubble has a birb house in her area, just waiting for the next birb on the server
Lizzie: “He real mystery is how i survived for so long”  Me: “You have died 5 times”
The vidoe picture gave parrot person vibes ngl
YESSSSSSSS I HAVE BEEN WAITING :)
lizzie: no one will understand these weird decorations Me after seeing the first one: of there a reflection on her past origins
Are all the nooks and crannies in honor of the amount of times you died? Lol
I love it
I get incredibly stressed watching lizzie die/on the verge.. I hope the enigma sticks around for a while
I think that the little nooks represent her life as a different mob on this server.
Not even 5 minutes in, and we welcome death-
I love how she kept the mysterious thing going lol And I think I know why she gathered all of those specific decor..
THE DECORATIONS IS EVERY ORGIN YOU HAD SO FAR
Sophiscated villian that was so funny 🤣
I wait 3 weeks and THIS is what I get? Upload videos more often please.😮‍💨
The rooms are all of the origins that she already had!!!
I just started watching this and yk what I think she will die at the end again
Ahhhhh the end is creepy
you where born in a cave and you died in a cave
Yesss evil Lizzie is back
my mades outside: *sigh* my mades inside:jufrfrnjhbjgydehbfegmfgthbjffr
I think that the nooks are themed on her past origins!because some of them look like her origins!and btw super cute base Lizzie! Love ur channel have the best day ever!!
the little bit in lizzie base is all her origins she has had over time
I LOVE the sinister Lizzie 😈😈
I haven’t watched the episode yet…..let me guess she dies 🙄😂
She did ent die!!!
Dammit, I was really hoping to get a bird Lizzie
Couldn’t Lizzie have climbed a tree while the pig was chasing her??! 😭
OMG
Me cracking her thingys-             IT’S HER ORGINS             your still here?                      Your not supposed to be here!                  Go, go home you can’t be here!            Fine,                          Bye
I have been waiting for this video for ever
Enigma+lizzie=CrAzY..... LOVE IT
When u find out what each mystery walls
Oki-gosh you just have to respect the skins 💅
Wh do I actually feel like that the last life will actually be the ocan queen which leads to empires season 2...
Did anyone notice that her feathers were just the pansexual pride flag? Cute though!
Lizzy: "Oh no! My one weakness: being weak!"  Same here, Lizzy. Same X3
OMG you keep dieing
Sus
All your past life’s
She’s a pan pride flag parrot
”what the ff- blazzzzzes”
Lizzie when she getting chased by a tapir: what the ffffff…        Blazes is that
wow 2 times you died just wow
Never let them know you next move lol 🐸
I love your origin it’s so cute 😍
I love your videos ldshadowlady
10:50 just watch.. DID SHE ALMOST SAY FUCK??!
Lizzie's nooks are based off her origins
who wants to bet she die in the next ep lol
I understand what she did she did them like every origin she had
You one witness is wholes and why does she keep dieing?
All those things are her past origins
Is it just me or do the nooks resemble her past lives hmmm maybe it has something to do with it maybe just maybe but I won't know because it is the mysteries of the enigma
Am I the only one who realized that her base and skin are all representing all her past origins
Lizzie joins villain league confirmed?
Those rooms/nooks symbolizes her previous lives. So creative! I love it.
I can fly no I cant😂
Berb
“My weakness…Being weak”
It's that your making all your origins
Omg your skin looks like the pan pride flag colors, i it so much, and the video is just amazing. Makes my day, Love you Lizzie<3
All of the weird stuff in the secret room is the orgins that she has been in the past. Pretty cool idea if you ask me.
Ahhhhh YES she is evil
So cool 😎, please 🙏 don't die.
I think I cracked the code of your decorations I think it all of your past afterlife lives
Who noticed on the corner things she put stuff from her past origins in it 🦝💐👽🦘🦜🦹‍♀️
omg it's been so long since she died and told us her origin in one episode and died at the end of that same episode
The birds height is Lizzie’s height irl
Be can see where your home is on the mini map
Joun the evil league!!!!! Also i want you to stay an enigma!!!
Oh all the little holes in the wall is the origins you where
The  nook are based off of her past origins that’s why she needed to get a bird I could tell by the slime blocks an amathist
she didnt die! wOoOoOoW
why is lizzie dying so much?
don't die again lol
I cracked the code with the decorations!! I will not say though.
In her nooks I know why she needs a parrot.She’s building her past Origens:)
10:58 Lizzie just almost swearing that’s what got me
Well done on getting on the top 4 for gaming!
So Lizzie is now a creepy pasta lol
The “mystery pods “ are her Origens
Lizzie’s lives are getting shorter and shorter
10 bucks she dies next episode 😐
The cause for Lizzie to have strange decoraciones and the purpuse is all of the little holes represents her past origins
Lizzy love them colors
Her decorations in her Bass is her past lives
how does she die this much lol
pansexual flag sock ? 💗💛💙
i know what the little dents in the secreat base is. its all of the lives she had
it's an amazing day when lizzie post's<3
I’m sorry but is Lizzie’s skin’s not the pansexual flag
Did anyone else get kinda sad when they saw Lizzies shrines to her past origins 🫤
All of the nooks in Lizzie's base are the origins she's been!
Please try and stay alive 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤❤
Im just surprised we weren't left off on a cliffhanger again
Im a problem solving genius: The decorations are her previous origins!
She can't even survive one episode anymore.😂😂
All those nooks are her original origins.
If you just keep staring at an enderman it doesnt attack, so it would be very easy for you to get ender pearls!
I just noticed that the thing you place in your base is from your previous lifes
Steal Scott’s weakness book
NOO THE PARROT WAS SO CUTE 😭 oh well, the enigma is still cool!
Is it just me or has Lizzy became more sinister
all the nooks are her past lives
Those corners in your secret hide quarters are of your last lives!!!!!!!
I really appreciate creepy deranged Lizzy.
I'm a little upset. like husband like wife (I'm just being silly, you did what you could)
i think the nocks are all her past life's
Gurl, we kno what the nooks are. They are sign of you past live. BUT YOU NEARLY SWORE. I was close to unsubbing-just keep it a family friend channel!
:>
Omg I have been waiting so long I am so happy to see that you have posted
I like how she decorated the nooks with all her origins
I think Lizzie is going insane yall🫣😭✋
WELL... the birb was incredibly short-lived    edit: Who else wants to see her team up with Lauren to be the new bad guys?
might wanna blurr the map too , Liz . Some may be able to find out where you are just by the picture
I’m pretty sure the nooks show off all your old origins 🥰
Are all the nooks your past lives?🧐
Birb Shubble would've been great friends with Birb Lizzie  edit: I spoke too soon
finally
I love how she put all her origins in her new home
The tiny areas are the things you have been
Are the nooks based off of your past lives?
The mystery is that she is decorating her lair with her past lifes
OMG Lizzie ur gonna make me cry... you made all your past lives! Pls don't die in your next episode! Luv you :)
"WHAT THE F--- BLAZES IS THAT" Made me cackle😂
Each of those crevices is based off of a thing
Lol love how Lizzie gets a new origin every episode
Aaaa the rooms represent her past origins >~<
I love how Lizzie based those nooks in her base off of her pat origins. (Or at least that's what I can tell! Parrot, racoon etc.) Awesome video ❤❤
The nooks are all the things lizzie has been during afterlife.
Lizzie Your New House Isn’t Actually A Secret, You Can See Where You Are On The Map
I have a feeling that each wall in her new base relates to her past origins
I love how in her base it represents all of her previous lifes!!
sorry her kingdoms base
I know what your Little nooks are based off of, drum roll please                          You're different origins
Every little nook that she made, represents one of the origins she already had. The rainbow area with the parrot head represents her life as a bird, and etc.
stop dieing tho
I know you are making all the nooks you previous life’s like the rainbow bird one it for your bird life obvs and the planty one is for if for your floral life ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ✨
The things that are in the nuts represent her uther orajins
make sure not to die again
Can you stare down a person? you should teleport behind someone and try it. love you Lizzie!
omg finally lizzie survived for more then an episode also yayyyyy our evil queen is back lets gooooo
i love the headquarter and how most of the bits represent an origin of lizzie
I understand that from your previous life 😁😁😁
Is any one getting flash backs to her empires secret base?
2:16 Well, these lives really aren’t lasting long are they?..
wait wy did she sound genuenly creepy near the end
Lizzie it's every origin you had
Lizzy Stop Dying!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i figured the rooms out they are all here lives! look floran (the flowers one), kangeroo ( the one with the cow heads and boats), and the red stuff the raccoon!
I CALLED IT, I KNEW SHE WOULD BECOME A VILLIAN
I feel bad for lizzie. She's always dying.
You out Endermaned the Enderman.
Did Lizzy try to kill  an undead mob🤨
I love the little past lives on the walls! There so cute!
Are strange decoration I believe  are  base of your origins  am I right
You literally died again
omg i adore your new origin its so cute!!
Despite her best efforts, lizzie has survived half an episode with an origin
lol love the way Lizzie threw us off by making the title a reference to her short life as a birb
I love how she put little nooks to represent each of her lives😊😊😊❤🧡💛💚💙💜
The nooks are her lives.
Guys if u dont know this shes building her past lives as decore
Her rooms are her past origins? Maybe? The tree would be the raccoon and I couldn’t tell the other ones but the bird idea was where it came together
The decorations lizzie made in her new base was her old originals
Oh oh. Know the little knocks Are her past origin
You should put question marks on a wall or your avatar
i see the mysteriouse decorations meanings i saw that one of them matched the outfit for the end floren the birb and thats the only two i saw
Is the puzzles in your secret base your past lives
I'M SCARED OF LIZZIE NOW
And Lizzie's back in the small gang club. Edit: nvm.
Lets just hope Enigma does not die at the start of the new video
I think the decor in her base is a bunch of references to all of her old origins. Like the one with a pumpkin and flowers is her end floran origin.
Lizzy your a villain now you should go talk to the other villains and join them and take over the afterlife server
It’s based on your Origins
Dude she sounded so creepy at the end, but I wish you best of luck with the villain top secret stuff✨👍
The mysterious décor is your past lives! Also I love your videos u always put a smile on my face x
Pls post a week from today
Idk why but I feel like a proud father now that uve finally lasted one episode
I feel as though lizzie is the one losing her sanity and not everyone else
We all thought vampire scot was evil, but this is a hole new level
OH NO MY WEAKNESS....BEING WEAK
omg!!  an episode where it did'nt end with her dying!!!
💘💝💗💓💞💕❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
Seriously what mod did you use?
I FIGURED OUT YOUR MYSTERY! Each cutout of the wall was for all of her origins she had so far, such as the bird, raccoon, goolien, kangroo and so on.
I  know what the walls with the random things are!  There to show all the old origins she use to be  FOR MEMORY
your the best
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍 🐶🐶🐶🐶
Ik want the little rooms mean                   ( they mean all the lifes she has gone through )
The nooks are based off her old origins I think
I love how you showed the origins as decor my favorite origins was the birb, Alien and raccoon but this one is a new fav!!!
❤❤❤❤❤🧡🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
wdym how are you supposed to take over the server if you cant kill a ghast?? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE OVER THE SERVER IF YOU CANT EVEN LIVE THROUGH ONE EPISODE
Lizzie amazes me :)
You could had just got a lead and trapped the parrot like put glass in that area so it could not escape 🙃🙂
LOL at the end how she was trying to be creepy and ominous but then immediately after is her usual cheery outro! 😂
☺
Mysteriously organized barrels. Mysterious nooks.  Hmmm, I must speak Lizzie to understand every reference. 🤔
PERRIOD LIZZIE DIDNT DIE
yay i have  been waiting for weeks :>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Nice how you made each room to represent each of your lives. Smart like an enigma but I figured it out at a glance.
YOU DIED IN 2 MINS
The little areas that you said no one would find out about what they meant are rooms based off of your origins before this one
"WHAT THE F- BLAZES IS THAT" i died 🤣
Stare at your enemies to death! (Maybe pretend to befriend them only to betray them as revenge for your death?)
Lizzie if yo gonna keep dying at this rate yo gonna be the first one to reach 10 lives on your like 12th episode 💀
wait half a month for a 13 min video of her only playing mc and building one thing. I think she should reconsider her posting schedule
I know the mystery of the decoration every area is a past afterlife.
Her nookes are her past origins
this*
Loving the villain arc!! Reminds me of Kingdomcraft
i have been cheacking on your vids every day for yhis
The Mysteries are actually everything she has ever been in afterlife
i know what the decorations are! theyre all her past origins of coarse!
LIZZIE YOU BEED TO POST MORE OFTEN 💀
Am I the only one that thought while trying to get a parrot that she would make a clone of herself using the parrot skin, and change back to her enigma skin later ?
I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky
Omg i love her new enigma origin
You spawned so far away because your kangaroo origin messed with your spawn point
Did you swear? I think you said the F word
This series is only going to last 10 episodes:'(
I know! Those are all your orgins!
It’s each of your origins i cns trll
LIZZY EHY DID IT TAKE YOU 2 WEEKS
LIZZIE ON HER EVIL ARC IS SOMETHING WE NEEDED TO SEE
those things in the walls are all Origins that she has had
The rooms are the things you have been and the colorful one is the bird
GIRL YOU DIE EVERY EPISODE LOL
You could get Scott's book from his evil house. It has everyone's books in it
She sure did sound like a psychopath in the end 😭
I think all the nooks are for each of Lizzie's origins.
The rooms are all the life's she had in the game
I understand your mysterious nooks
Omg yes go girl
so how fast will she die this time that answerse my qustion 1 minits
I would advise stop dyeing and stay inside.
The base shows her past origins
It’s all her origins
Bruh how does she die so much-
10:57 "what the f- blazes is that" thats funny
I know this is a VERY big ask but...I wanna be an admin on this smp(vampire origin)by admin I mean creative mode and other things. I'd never use it to too much chaos. Oh and by the way I'm not a youtuber myself but I've always wanted to be an admin on this server ever since ur first episode so plz consider it(also plz help with a few things fuz I don't know how to get on ur server I mean I know I use pc but still)
Rip parrot lizzie
If I can't have your friendship, I'll have your head!
I can't belive that Lizzies parrot life ended so short. However the enigma could work to an advantage. Why don't you try your powers on a player.
Lizzie you have like 5 lives left be careful!
i love how all the nooks represent her past lives! another great idea
I like how you made a shrine to each life of yours
pansexual flag on the right leg-? 0-0
I feel like her base and the little colorful areas are her past origins and I don’t know why there’s a bee area and she got a bird for her birb origin and the tiny house and a stick is her raccoon origin the amethyst and copper rods is her goolien origin  and that’s my theory! Edit*  the bee area is her Florian origin
It took so long but it's ok
i am in love with this series 😭
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FRO THIS TO COME OUT!!!!!
I cant bleave that she somehow survived to the end.
I enjoy evil Lizzie Also in kingdomcare Lizzie was very evil  Is there a correlation🤔
How does she have six lives left she dies every episode
oh mei gowd i quewstion my sanity riaeight knoe
And origins
Her old bases are the details
Each room that she is putting in a sign of the lives she has lived
I cannot believe she died after 10seconds😂😂😂
Maybe you could put all of your origins into every nook
Always the cute animals
not me hoping that she stays like this and becomes part of the villain League
I will be so surprised if lizze can go next video without dieing
Wow Her base has all of her origins in it😮
I love how the different sections of her base are decorated based on her past origins
I'm soooo sad she died
Do you have for life so easy be careful
Riddle me this
Those little room represents your past orgins
You know we can see your minimap, right? Not so secret
The second I saw the spruce tree I knew what she was doing
gamer
Can you please post video early
The rooms and decor stands for all of your origins
I think you spawned in the desert because of your old kangaroo origin
I feel so bad for her
It’s one of those different corners or different organs you’ve had
The fact that the chat spelled *Birb*
SHES MAKING ALL OF HER ORGINS-
i love how lizzie forgot her base is on the minimap
10:58 Lizzie what was that?
Didn't die today Hooray!
I actually have a question for ldshadow lady why did you change your skin to your normal skin or is it just fake news?
Those mysteries are actually your past origins
Me: you better not die in this episode Lizzie: No
Oh, I think I know the decorations, there parts of her old lives and did Lizzie almost cuss because of a pig??
I know the mystery behind the areas. The are all her origins that she lost. :()
Any body else see it says birb not bird at the beginning😂🤔 Also Lizzie u are my favourite YouTube I love you so so so much!!!
Hey Lizzie make a creppy basement you're a'n enigma soo
YOUR EVIL PLACE HAS ALL OF YOUR LIFES
Pretty pastel Birdie :) Edit  Pretty pastel Birdie go boom boom
OMG PARROTS ARE MY FAVORITE ANIMAL/TYPE OF BIRD
umm- how many lives dose Lizzy have left-
the totally secret nooks probably mean her past lives lol
0:37  2:16
I really like this episode and I found out what the decorations were most of them or all of them are they’re to represent ldshadow lady or if she sees this your origins
Is that the pan flag on her skin?
I’m so excited for this new Origin I hope Izzy doesn’t die again
Ldshadowlady: new world record for the fastest death in mine craft.
lizzie is gonna be banned of the sever next episode!
Lizzie’s gonna do REAL mischief with this one.
Heyyy can anyone lmk how to access this server pleaseeeee🫶🏼
YESS AN EPISODE WHERE SHE DOESNT DIE AT THE END!
All of them little nooks and crannies that Lizzie calls mysteries are actually Lil memorials/gravestones that are basically the embodiment of each of her past houses and what she used to be
"what the ffff- BLAZES is that"
I love this series so much that everytime she dies i get annoyed cos i dont want this series to end as quick as it is doing.
2:14 lizzie I am SHOCKED
When did the Lizzy we know and love become creepy evil and mysterious also Lizzy you only have 4 more origins left (not counting the newest one)
Decorations are for past lives
Her seventh life, already.
Stop deying lol
All of her nooks are references to her past afterlife lives
9:55 The walls of all your past life homes? XD so sad some of your past lives didn't even get a chance to have a home. 10:20 ahh okay not the homes just your past lives in general...still a shame some of them died homeless though 😮‍💨
That'll do pig... That'll do~ Riddle me this, why do you not own any mirrors as the enigma?
All the nooks r all of ur past lives
all the lives shes had
All the nooks are snipits of all her biomes  Also Idk know if was intentional but she has a pan flag on her leg 7:28
Yesss
i realized their all of her old origins
Is this Lizzie’s way of telling us she’s pan-
she’s going back to her roots
Th walls are about her past lives
all the nooks are representing all of  lizzies lives
The end of the vid was kinda creepy
Omg I love how she ALLMOST said the f word at 10:57 but then she realize she is making a video 😂😂😂😂😂
You the first one aut of the seever
Trick someone into a steering contest lol. I also would like to see the clone and walking through walls.
Ahhhh kingdom Kraft vibes anyone 🥰
5:28
I just saw you kill a bird my favorite my favorite animal is a bird and I just feel sad now
Did any on realise that when lizze was a bird she only had 8 hearts???
10:13 , all the nooks are showcasing her past origins. That's what I think
10:58 I like how lizzy was about to swear lol-
I love your channel
I believe that lauren is gong to get the enigma as well. At the end of her video she said oh im the perfect villain
me considering lizze is a scyco
GOD bless you all Amen 🙏 for HE Loves you all Amen 🙏
FINALLY SHE HAS NOT DIED AT THE END OF AN EPISODE
Finally you got the episode and I’m so long
All the weird decorations are her past lives.
Ah yes mysterious decorations spoiler below 👇        Mysterious decorations based on her old lives lol 😂😆
10:57 lizzy almost swearing is the most evil thing she's ever done.  Except....         Rumours have been said and heard that lizzy....        She slept at 09:01 instead of 09:00.  It's a mystery and no one knows if it's true or not but even so, sleeping past your bedtime is just a big no
Something tells me each little indent thing in her base is based on one of her life’s
8:37 Your map is showing where you are 😭
i have so meny questions .....but all im saying is wow.
Lizzie, I've got an idea. You can add in Redstone puzzles to keep away the other players.
I think that the little indents are based off her past Orgins!
I think I figure out the nook are about the old origins of your people
you should stare at lauren
I know why you made the nooks they all represent your past lives
pov : know what those corners are for 😏
Are the decorations based off all her past lives? Like the bird one was a key hint, the bee hive one was the Florian, the one with the stick and the spruce tree in a pot was the raccoon, too lazy to say the other ones but that’s just a theory
i like how you incorpirated every origin in your build
Are the nooks representing her lives she's lost?
I think Lizzie spawned in a desert because she was supposed to as a kangaroo, but it glitched and spawned her in a desert in her next life
She made the nooks her past lives
she’s not died, that’s a brand new start  maybe this one might live for two episodes
I swear Lizzie is gonna be the first out this series
Lizzie only has 4 lives left
BIRB
I think the nooks are all ur origins that you’ve been through
Lizzie turned into a cute bird and then died immediately 😭😭
What game is this called??
The little nooks symbolise her last lives
When you realize Lizzie almost said a curse word
Why are the comments like 50% bots?  That's too many bots.
Lizzie: very secret location The map at the top: sure
Lizzie! Go to Lauren and join the The Villains!
I know what those little decorations are they are your previous lives and decorations I don't know how to explain it but the boat where you did a boat prank on Scott with a lot of boats the cows was where are you did the prank on CPK with the cows in his house the Slime and the amethyst was when you were an alien and you build your own biome and you needed the bird for your other life and the Honey was when you were a Florin and I think the composter was when you were a raccoon and yeah if I'm wrong please say something
Me: hoping she doesn't die to quickly  Lizzie: dies at the beginning of the episode
That episode ended quickly. (Definitely a birdbrained idea, attacking a zombie.)
I love how she made all the little nooks in her house look like her past life, and I just wanted to say that you're one of my favourite YouTubers and the fact that you keep dying and come back with a positive attitude every time is so kind.  Whenever I'm having a bad day, I come to your videos and watch them. Keep up the positivity and great work :)
I’m kind of scared for what is next.
//spoilers     i really went into this going "please dont die again lizzie"   2 minutes.
I LOVE birds da are so cute lick you😀
Guess the robots
The nocs are her previous lifes
if i were you and i had the ingma origin i would not figerout what to build but i dont understand the orange roof your origin is very dark and misterios
This is all of you lives
I made fan art of raccoon lizzie and now Idk what to do with it
5:24 staring contest be like
Shubble was a birb but she was a tit! You could of been birb friends 😁
I know everything about the smell of your new home your home is based off of all of your old lives
the enigma is my favorite origin i’ve seen so far. if i was in that server i would LOVE to play that origin😂
Can you do a empires season 2 please
Finally! I wait every day!  And look on ur channel your hilarious and funny and amazing I think you should have 100 million subs I have been watching you for 5 years btw I was kinda hoping u would get to stay as a bird  lol
the way she almost swore but covered it up with blazes
I understand your mystery your decorated walls with mysterious things. It represent all of your past origins.
Prediction: Lizzie is gonna die next episode.
The part where she makes rooms it’s her past lifes
No offence but, why couldn't she just deal knockback to the zombie instead of trying to fly when she was in the hole? it would take a while but she could have killed it and been able to continue as a bird.
I know what the things are your orgians
You spawned in the desert because in your past life it said you would respawn in a desert
OMG YOU POSTED EWLYEYEYEYE
I think you respawned in a dessert because that's where the kangaroo's default spawn was supposed to be anchored, and because of the nature of afterlife, despite dying and loosing that origin, your spawn was still tied to the desert? or something? and supposedly your bed got destroyed so it sent you to your default spawn  edit: OK THIS NEW ORIGIN IS EPIC THO
Guys... Lizzy's gone insane... again
I love how she lives 1 day as every single origin and a;so I get those mystouries probs spelt wrong T-T
I love how all the nooks look like your past lives 😊
She should join the league of villans
All of the tiene rooms in ur base are ur previous origins
Blah blah blah blah blah
I know your secret I now with the many reasons are for hahaha 😆 😈🦻
Did anyone else notice that all of Lizzie’s nooks are memorials of her past origins?
For crying out loud add Herobrine to your list you could get it.
shes doing different live rooms
When Lizzie went to the end i thought she’d stare the ender dragon to death
I think the bird is a really good orgin but you sadly died
Did she almost say the F word.
I’m going to cry everytime something trys to hurt you now 😭😭😭
that was a very funny vid hi lizzie i am your number 1 fan
Hmm I wonder what the secret in her base is (definitely not representing her deaths)
I know what the walls are in her little house type thing waterfall it’s what she has been it’s themed of what she has been in her but I don’t know like five lives 😂
Hi Lizzie,  You inspired me to start my own channel and I’m really enjoying it! Thank you so much for being who you are! If you reply to this it will make my day! I watched your among us streams while I had covid and they really helped! Love you so much!!!!! Keep doing you!  Love HoneyTea  P.S-I don’t know why so many emojis…. 🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️🍯 ❤️
So I found out what those little nooks are there like her different origins
Its based on all of her lives arent they?
im so sad that the bird life was so short :(
Lizzie I love the way how in the nooks you built memorials to your past origins!
Let me guess all of the decorations are part of which life you had in the afterlife for example the purple magenta and yellow wool decerreshon is whene you was a bird.
How many times has she died
honestly this just feels like kangaroo part 2: the reckoning
She wants to plan empires
Those remind me of all her past Minecraft lives
How did lizzie survive on 1 heart in x life for so long?
If you dia again girl I will be
One thing: PLS DON'T DIE.
GIRL
scary episode, i like it, i think it's funny and sad u died at the begging lizzie~ XD
I think all the box’s equal one of her deaths
I don't know if this was done on purpose but I noticed the pan flag on both origins which I find rlly cool :)
Pls pls do episode s quicker PLSSSSS
I think that the nooks have something to do with every life she has had. It makes sense since every  nook had multiple decorations and for the parrot nook it just had a parrot head 🦜
LIZZIES PARROT SUIT THING IS THE PAN FLAG 💖💛💙
Those mystery holes she made is her past life’s I love it really cute
Lizzie, you gotta be careful, ur gonna run out of after lives soon
Eyyy I discover your house is based of ur past lives
The decorations on the walls are all of the different origins she's gone through
Completely random non understood decorations..
Past lives its past lives isn't it
whaaaaaaa
YALL the nooks are her previous lives that is the cutest shit I've seen
Your little nooks are your past lives 🥰👍
Good job staying alive lizzie
Should definitely target The Guardians of Afterlife
Lizzie you should join the villains with Lauren now,
The decorations in her house is her past lifes! ✨🥰
I can believe she didn't die!!!
Weren’t you a fish?
I love how Lizzie put her past lives in her new house 😊❤️
Finally
All the nooks are your past lives
Lizzy:oh no my one weakness being weak Me: OMG HAHAHAHAHAHA
The little rooms she made represent her original it’s so cute😭
Lizzy u left the map on the corner and people can fine ur base .-.
You made the secret a base of things that look like your past origns
She was making like a museum of all her lives
Ive been loving all these episodes but now I really want Lizzie to stay alive because I don't want the series to end
In a hoOooooole
Just incase you didn’t know the nooks are all of her past lives just incase you didn’t know.
WHAT THE F- blazes is that?
i love the house desing and at 9:48 i know what you did lizzie your doing your past life desings
I think I have solved her house puzzle thing it's all of her past origins I think?
Lizzie-“what the fffffff- blazes”
Just so you know, her “decorations” references to her past lives on the server
I mean at least she didn’t die twice in an episode 😭
PLS BE FRIEND WIT LAURENSIDE EN I WIL SUBSCRIBE EGEN
Woah! Amazing.
I can’t believe you done this
I know where the base is from the map in the top left corne
All the little looks and crannies are all your lives right?
pls make more videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg I senced that Lizzie posted another video!!!
bird in a cave... so canary? Or how about birds that actually live in caves? Like cave swallows, oilbirds, swiftlets etc? I feel the spawning in a cave could be embraced tbh
I lava your vids
Do not use this is me in the beginning
Is all of her death
Oh this is definitely not a display of her origins so far..... SIKE..
lol i know what her ne w base means its some of her origins in there cause in the c-mike colored one it looks like her bird skin an the one with the gems and blue blocks is the her goolian origin and the red one is her racoon origin
We all know the mysterious rooms are her lives
Sinister lizzie is my new favorite
Lizzie has turned into a yandere...well this just got interesting!
I love her new life and she is so mysterious I love it
birb is good bird is bad
"my one weakness, being weak" describes this series too well loll
b i  r b
Ldenigmalady might be the only one on the server more powerful than vampire Scott (yes I know that he is now dead due to dragons)
is it me or is lizzie the jimmy of afterlife
Lizzieeeeeee, I love your videos but please don't take 2 weeks to post again😭
:) ❤❤
Those mysterious nooks are your past life’s lol love your videos Lizzie
All the "mestery decorations are all of our lives !!!!!!!
The nooks are themed off of your past lives, aren't they?
I believe in you lizzie you survived a good amount as the enigma you can survive a whole episode next episode
I love how she added all of her lives for memory, I love it 🥰
This was the most chaotic episode
“Oh no! My one weakness! Being weak!”
OMG LIZZIE DIDNT DIE BEING THE ENIGMA ITS A SIGN
It's a repeated pattern of Lizzie dying each episode and im kinda living for it
I love the fact that the way she talks about being "some kind of genius" to "solve the mystery" and all that makes her sound like The Riddler from the arkham games. You know, E. Nigma?
I love your video's LDschadolady
Wait wait wait both character skins in this EP had a pan flag on them
LIZZIE IS ENTERING HER VILLIAN ERA AND IM HERE FOR IT
I didn't see those videos analyzing Lizzies skin to see which Origin she had Haha that's awesome
Lizzie has created so many homes and lost so many of them that I swear one time a random person on the afterlife is in peace just gonna find 5 homes -
Liz- Lizzy- the Map in the corner of your screen- if someone just follows and looks around and sees its the same Spot as in the map in the corner of your screen- they will know where your base is! Be careful-
How long has it been since one of her episodes didn’t end on the respawn screen
Lizzie little mysteries on her walls are her past life
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THISSS
4 hours ago she posted this and already 5.9k comments whatttt!?
I think every little pocket in the wall represents her past  Iives
Each decoration is her past life
9:56 it's from you're past lives
I GOT IT! the different 'mysterious' rooms are all of her past origins!
Aww... Her parrot Outfit was so CUTE! why couldn't it stay longer  :(
when she showed the secret base i got Kingdom Craft memories
When she almost died from a boar I thought “just climb those vines”!
You became my favorite animal😩😩😩😩
"Sorry whoever's portal that is, but you have a new guest!" That was unexpectedly funny.
Love your vids Lizzie! 🥰 Pls make more afterlife vids
Lizzie's videos are so short but she makes them so entertaining to watch..what kind of witchcraft is this...
lizze is doing all of her times of being  diferent origin
The nooks are based on her recent deaths
She has the Pan flag in her shoe 7:31
Does anyone else see the pansexual flag in her sock or was it just me also Oml I love this series
lizzie u should join the league of villans or make ur own league
Is it just me or did I find out that the little areas in the secret area are based on part of her past lives in 5 seconds?
Why do i love lizzie as a engimna
i love your channel so much <3
I am watching this whole video me saying quietly to myself please don’t die Lizzie please don’t die Lizzie
Ldshadowlady your minimap shows where you are soooo
You connot die now!
all i remember is: racoon, flower person. BUT KANGAROO? PARROT? WHAT? edit: SHE DIED ALREADY???
NOOO SHE DIED
I love the fact she incorporated all her relives in her house
Finally another life where Lizzie can live for than 1 episode
dang the end was so creepy and cute in the same time it was AMAZINGGGG!!!!!
When you realise that Lizzie could just use a spyglass and kill people from afar 😳
I know what the designs of the nooks are now.
Omfg
How do you say your mysterious decorations are your origins that you had in the past
The pan sock on her enigma character 😍 (at least I think that's what it is)
i hope she keeps the enigma longer i love it
why does lizzie always die every episode!!??
Wonder if shes gonna make it past 10 episodes :/
i love how she left the mini map at the top
You could do a mysterious treasure hunt for everyone with really wired riddles
Guys, she survived more than one episode!
Oh the nooks are her different previous origins- from left to right we have Kangaroo Florian Goolien Raccoon Birb very smart-
Don’t die next episode please
Shes really just speed running these lives
Is no one gonna talk about the almost f bomb
You died🤦🏼‍♀️ Again!? How the Frick😂
What u just got 4 lifes left be carful
l haven't seen the video yet, but l hope you're not gonna die aGAiN🤞
borb
Hi Lizzie!
I love it the bird skin was so cut
The miss serious reasons are how many times you have died
I love your skin Lizzie You are so cute!
Hey Lizzie are you going as a solo villain or are you joining the bad guy grup?
Nooks: every orogin shes had 😐
all of the nooks and crannies are for all of your origins you had?
I'm currently IN LOVE with Lizzie's new villain ark, it's a perfect balance of her usual style and a similar slow creep factor to horror in a sense, plus she's an enigma, and fear of the unknown is a fragile yet necessary component of horror, without it it's just adventure with a dark storyline, plus with how Lizzie's usual style of cute and color yet not overboard compliments it to make the perfect balance.  Did I just do an analysis on why this episode is awesome? Yes. Is this a testament to how skilled Lizzie is? Yes.
I came out of the world just as I came into it In a hhhoooleeee
PLEASE DONT DIE SO SOON LIZZIE
Her almost swearing is my favorite part of the video for some reason😅🤣
PARROTS!!!!!!!!!!
“This seems unimportant.” It literally said you can’t wear most armors or can’t have bows and- *Why do I even try?*
i was waiting so long for this ;-;
no way
wow a life that lasted more than 1 episode this is amazingg
Join evil club
all the little decoration box things are all the previous lives Lizzie had.....
All of the decorations are for what her previous origins were, Did anyone else realise it after she put the Blue slime down?
Isn't that all your lives Lizzy?
I figured out the decorations, I know other people have. But it’s all of the origins!!
I love your videos so much I love you
am i the only one who’s thinking: PANSEXUAL LIZZIE?????
You having a different origins this is the secret
Did she spawn in the dersest because she was kangaroo
SHUBBLE HAS BEEN A BIRB TOO!
Im so excited for Lizzie’s villain arc!
Lol- me watching this so the my bird on my shoulder
Lizzie pesky bird arc  Edit: nvm I spoke to soon
I didn’t watch this yet but please don’t die Lizzie
😠😠😠😠😠😠😤😤😤😤😤😡😡😡😡😡
Can u join scott’s evil group 😏
Bird’s aren’t stupid. They’re way more smart than you are.
From a trash panda to a kangaroo to a bird
And why do you keep dying it makes me so frustrated 😭😭😭😭
what if we had an episode where she didn't die? nah its impossible
Who else has notice that Lizzie's new skin has all her old origins? The left leg has the Bird origin. Right Leg: Kangaroo Origin. Tips on her arms: Goolien. Her clothes: Floran Origin. And her back: Racoon Origin!
It is all of her old origins
This is my favorite skin and my favorite life of anyone so far
Each nook is based of every other origin you’ve had
OMG SOMEONE GESSED WHO YOU ARE NEXT OMG HOW LOL
FINALLY A VIDEO please make them longeer pleaseeeeeee
enigma... oh my god... the riddler
Growing up watching her I forget she targets a younger audience, so I forgot she couldnt say “what the f—-). Best part.
I wish I could figure out what those rooms meant
Lizzie should get really good weapons etc so she can stay alive for this cool origin!
I just realized that all the decorations in her head quarters resembles all of her past origin 💀
Why don't you upload everyday makes me so mad waiting
Lizzie is so good at the game that she beats the game and starts oven in 2 minutes and 20 seconds
Lizzie, you can't keep dying!
Your mystery is your past origins!
As a future house idea you could make the house from up!🏠🎈
I actually understand a mystery in your room of the colors and whatever
M I THE ONLY ONE WHO REALIZED THE  PARROT COLORS ARE THE PAN FLAG
"what the Fu       blazes is that?" LD shado lady kid friendly channel
LIZZIE! YOUR PARROT COLOR SCHEME IS THE PANSEXUAL FLAG
YES LIZZIES VILLAIN ARK!!!!!💪‼️‼️
what's your shaders?
Racoon: red Floren: pink Enigma: orange ?: purple, green, cyan and yellow
You should upload more but I’m rlly excited to see what you do in your next episode! Are you going to die and get another life ??XD just guessing
WHAT THE FFFF- BLAZES IS THAT!!!
i cant wate for more!!!
The nooks you made are all the origins you have been through 🤞
Hey lizzie btw your mini map is on
10:05 ah yes each wall is your old orgina?
The small quarters represent her past lives
If you stare at an Enderman long enough it will stop being hostile in vanilla
Wasn't expecting that 😍
At the beggining of this video, I was praying, HOPING LIZZIE WON'T DIE ONCE AGAIN And in the middle of this video (WHEN SHE DIED ONCE AGAIN), I WAS ONCE AGAIN PRAYING, HOPING, SAYING LIZZIE PLEASE DON'T DIE AGAIN  BTW, your decoration inside your..... headquarters, those were the origins that you were (sorry for my English)
Haha I love how the outro is so creepy and mysterious but then random anime music pops up
ahh yes it seems as though the decorations are all her old origins aha  i am very sophisticated mwhaha
I know the mystey/decreshions you lives
I know what the small areas are! The one with the small roof thing represents the racoon orgin, one represents floran origin, one represents goolian, one represents kangaroo and one is for the bird orgin.
......ah she died didn't she...oop she died instantly...
"IN A HOOOOLLLEEE!"
I love how she is like, MYSTERIOUS DECORATIONS  P.S. if you actually don’t realize don’t read th next bit. . .     I think she has an obsession with how many times she’s died.
I love all the Villian arcs in Afterlife! 😂❤
If I had a hundred dollars for every time Lizzie died…  please be careful Lizzie!
The imitation game???
I bet her puzzles represent all her lives
I really love your skin for this video because it has little hints to your past lives like a bird colored sock and a kangaroo sock but also.... this is random but I think you should continue your 100 day challenge in mincraft that you did a while ago and do 100-200
Lizzie almost swearing but changing it to Blazes is TOO FUNNY💀💀
Perfect! Lizzie's villan arc is back! (You should start the villan league back up again!)
All of the decorations represent all of her past lives :)
That’s so cute that you used your past origins as walls!!
Her 2 minute life as a birb…WELP
LOVING THIS SMP!
Lizzie: Parrot  Also Lizzie: Kills parrot
You never no if Lizzie going to die or not
Imagine if she could stare down the enter dragon….👀
Every mystery has a purpose, and so the origins are forever begin, and forever end.
Lizzie is there anyway I can show fan art without  having Twitter or Instagram?
“You will never guess what these are for”  (proceeds to build a fireplace)  Ah yes no clue
ya now there is a leuge of bad guys on the server go to lauran to join
10:00 haha from the slime and stuff I already knew those were based off of your previous lives
You ned raveng on lenrenzSide 😈
The base has decorations for each origin!!!! I love that!! <3
The room is just full of the origins that LDshadowlady was, did anyone else think that or just me?
Spoiler: season 2 is coming in empires and she is making decorations for her lifes
the walls on her base means her past forms like the amethyst one with a copper lightning rod it remids the alien
ldparrotlady died and became ldeigmalady i love your vids i stared waching when i was 6 now im 9 to this day :)
every episode smh.
hi
STOP DYING LIZZIE😂😂😂
I love it
I think in the dents in her wall she put references to each life (if it wasn’t obvious)
The decorations are her pass lives
Join Scott's evil legion plz
All the books are in honor of her lives and it is great
Anyone else think she looks like a butterfly?
I just realized the sections of her walls where each is a “Mystery” are actually each of her previous life, the sapling, red/deep stone is her Raccoon life, the copper and amethyst is her Alien and so on
Ain't no way my brain was able to link up those decors   The red with composter and plant pot: Lizzie's first life, Racoon.  The honeycomb blocks with the bee hive and pumpkin: Lizzie's second life, The End Floran.  The amethyst blocks with the lighting rods and slime: Lizzie's third life, Goo-lian.  The white concrete with cow heads and boat: Lizzie's fourth life, Kangaroo.  The pink yellow and blue walls with the purple floor: Lizzie's fifth life, Birb.  The bookshelves and lectern: L̶̡͇͌̓̏̚ĩ̷̩̳̠̉z̷͇͑́̇z̸̞̞̯͈̆̋̔͝i̷̢̭̬̇̍e̶̳̱͊͐̈́'̵̧̝͐͋s̴̰̣̤̩̆̏̓͝ ̸̛̛̳͍̀͑/̷̩͊̽́/̶̹̏̐̔/̸̯̪̐/̴̗͖̘̥͛ ̸͙̗̥̣̀̌l̵̗̠͕͈̈́̕i̶͙̊̾̉̐f̸̣̹̋̄̈̇ë̵̠̠̦́́̚,̷͓͑̍ͅ ̷̡̞̙̩͑)̴̪̪̺͒͐/̴̨͉͖͈͂)̶̺̓͂̒͒/̴̨͓̩̘̉)̴̧̢̦͐̔/̸͉͆̀̈́(̴̘͚͓̝́̎͆͠/̶̤̪̉̒)̸̘̪̆͝/̴͔͎̬̅̇)̸̼͈͒̔͑͆
And when you was an goolien
Cool origins! Also please stop dying, I don’t want you In the actual afterlife yet.
PLEASE BE CAREFUL I FEEL THIS SERIES WONT LAST LONG
The decoration concept of making individual parts of the wall themed to every life she has had is so cute 🥰
It also has a place which represents your home when you got your first origin
Just waiting for her to use her new powers on a player to see their reaction XD
Yay I love this series u was just thinking about afterlife and then it got posted!!
I think the burrows are to show her to,es so far
If she were to stay as a bird for a while,  she would be able to avoid all wars by just hiding in the sky
I think she spawned there because the Kangaroo origin spawned in a desert
PLZ DONT DIE AGAIN JUST STOP DIEING PLZ 💀💀💀💀💀💀😭😭😭😭✋✋
ima just say the longest origin that lizzie has  had was the racoon...
....how did she die two minutes in the video.....?
I like how here skin is all the organs she's had before
The base decorations are not so hard to u nderstand that's the lives
Is no one going to talk about how Lizzie almost said the F word but then said blazes instead 👀👀❓
Lizzie you almost said it
Can we take a moment to see that lizzie dose the best videos for her fans she makes her videos so great and awsome but dies a lot
It has the end and you lived in the end when you are a floren
OMG! Ur enigma skin looks like a kawaii version of Gojo :3
I know the mysterious reason is those all the past life you been in
Have I missed something? Has anyone noticed that both skins for the origins she’s had this episode have pansexual colours? The bird was pink with yellow and blue tips on the feathers and the enigma has a pan leg warmer-
THE DECORATIONS ARE  EACH LIFE YOU HAVE HAD IN THE PAST
I'm sorry but Lizzie's face with the blindfold makes it look like a muppet head.
Is the little areas in your base based on your past lives
OMG OMG OMG! I HAVE BEEN WAITING THREE WEEKS FOR THIS VID! (I know that’s not long but still) OMG OMG OMG
Your house is your past lives
I have figured out the little nook`s meanings (Lizzie`s past lives).
no lizzie you did not die i dont belive it
:)
BIRD IS THE WORD! ps-i LOVE ur videos Lizzie!<3
Lizzy was alive as a birb for like, 2 minutes or less
FINALLYYYY
All her after life’s that’s what she’s doing!
Ok the ‘Mysterious Nooks’ were decorations of here old origins; they were:Books for the raccoon 🦝, Flower thingy 😂 🌸(in the end), aliennn, KAngGaRoooooo,
Agein you die in your new aragin
I love how the 'decoration' nooks are just her past orgins!!
Hope she stays in this form for a little while
Took me a second but I realized what all the "random nooks" are, I won't say just in case people want to guess for themselves
I understand them,it's her past lives.
i love lizze because she takes advantage of bad things and she is super sweet ive watched all her videos and i love her too the moon
Who here wanna bet how long will lizzie last with the enigma?
You should creep out your friends! You could put like signs saying “I’m watching” and just be crouched down in the shadows or something!!
I am sick so seeing that Lizzie uploaded made my day🙂🍄
i think her decorations are her past orgins
SHE SOUNDS SO MUCH LIKE STAR BITTERFLY WHY? ALSO…. For once she didn’t die at the end of an episode
The feathers are the colours of the pan flag! :D
Finaly you made it one episode without dying 👏
I love how u represented each life of urs in the house! Adorable!
Lizzie: Parrot. Dies from Zombie.  Also Lizzie: Kills her formal origin and puts it's head on the wall.
Alle the smal roms is the orgin you was Before you died
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS BUT DO NOT GO IN
Wow!!!
At 10:58 I almost heard Lizzie say what the *_FuDgE_*
Seems like being a birb is hard- Shelby died the episode she got it too XD
All of the noks she has represented one of her lives
Lizzie,you need more defense armor for these long time attack to kill or avoid any mobs.
Finally yassss
:D
Your rooms are your past lives!!!
i love orange as your base because its my last name
I hate all zombies now
omgomg we need pirate joel so lizzie can be his pet ❤ nvm she died
Yay she didn’t die at the end!!
The map
Lizzie, you showed your map in the base
she lived 2:16 minutes as a birb
Wow I'm earlier then usual<3
She looks like the pan flag :D
I know what the decorations mean i dont think you are an enegma the one with e stic is for the racon coluor is for the birb ......... so one wow but my favorite wos the racon
I figured out your wall designs, Lizzie. It's your previous origins
Your almost gone. I'm worried
lizzie dont die! you only have 4 lives left!
I don’t know why but you being an enigma makes me actually feel sick like weirdly
LIZZIE LIZZIE AGVDNWVWNAN I MISSED YOU SO MUCH I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BWVSNAVBSNDBE
I love birds a lot I’m sad that you weren’t a bird for long😫😫😫😫🕊🪶🦜🦩🦢🐓🦃🦤🦚(I really hope you see this Lizzie)
It makes me kinda mad how often she dies. (No hate)
I'm guessing that the nooks are based off your origins.
I love how Lizzie dies in 3 minutes and she didn’t even make through a day.🙂
Her voice was creepy in the end ngl 💀💀💀
The lil nooks are for your past lives
LIZZIE AGAIN.
I have figured out that each decoration is a memory of her past lives!!!
Lizzie needs life support and one of those buttons you press to alert 911 in an emergency.
Lizzie, I have an idea for the next video you should build a small black temple where you can bring your enemy and then trap them in the temple and then ask for a staring comp and kill them <3
You can fly you can fly you can fly❤❤❤❤❤❤
You should Definetly join the new villains group girl
Just me or Lizzie bird skin look like the pan flag
Lizzie=scary
08:25 Lizzie you now that we see were you are on the map in the left corner?
The little things in her secret base is the littlier version of her old other houses.... SEE IM BIG BRAIN LIZZIE
The titel : I can fly! My old brother : cool shes prob a parrot!!!  Me : WHAT THE HECK WHY IS THE FIRST BIRD TYPE YOU THINK OF A FREAKING PARROT JUST SAY SHES A BIRD THATS EASYER...  And the fact that it said "birb" instead of bird ... Rlly good grammar!:) (No hate ofc✨🙂)
wait in her base!  purple and cyan nook for the alien the nook with the honeycomb pumpkin and flowers for the floran! i can't figure out the nature and cow area though! maybe the cow area for the kangaroo? because the cactus? it remains a mystery!
Every little space is for all your lifes
That poor bird got killed for hating !
the "misterios" decoration in the nooks are baised on all of her past origens when she died as a sad reminder
Lizzie:  *decorates her house* "ah my mysterious decorations" Me: "wait those are just remindersvof her last life's"
Oh nevermind
My therapist called me an enigma when I first met her and now I fear this is what she meant…
You are a birb not a bird but a birb
10:24 THOSE R HER PAST LIFE'S RACOON, ALIEN, PARROT, KANGAROO, flower  thats what the decorations are!! *! i think.*
I love the way that all the little spots she put in the house represents her past life's
“What the f- Blazes is that!”
Pls do not click read more                                                       Ur SO COOL
She dies, then she lives again- I wonder when she will die again
Wait Shelby had this one
I KNOW WHAT THE NOOKS IN HER BASE ARE!!! HER PAST LIVES and her skin is a combo of past live skins too
Anyone else notice the nooks in her enigma house were throwbacks to her previous origins? The flowers and beehive were her end floran, the rainbow stripes were her short parrot origin, and the red Chinese looking area was her raccoon origin, etc.
Anyone else love have she's getting all the cute ones?! 💛
YASSSSSS IVE BEEN WAITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please don’t die I love this origin
whell you wher a burd only for some mints but not your new skin is cool
"WHAT THE . . . . . *realises what will happen if i say that* . . . . . BLAZES WAS THAT?!"
Lizzie: "No my one weaknessBeing weak!"
3 HOURS LATE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The episode was great! But looking at the bird skin I just went: "Does Lizzie look like a walking pansexual flag or am I just queer?"
I feel bad for her she dies pretty much every 10 minutes.
Mini map lol
Don’t die pleaseeeeeeeeee
I’m starting to get annoyed 😓 your dying every episode and I feel rlly bad that you find a home/spend house and house making a house and even a whole biome just to die the same episode, and I wish you could stay the same origin for at-least 3-5 episodes I’m not sure I like this new series much to be honest. The point of the 10 lives is that your supposed to not die a lot and you just keep on dying 😭 I’m not tryna show hate or anything though I love your other series just maybe stop dying ☹️
pan flag ._.
She’s not a birD she’s a birB
Anyone who's confused on what the little areas are they simbilase her old origins also the cow one is a kangaroo
Lizzie! You are so smart! I know that you put all the rooms as one of your origins!
I know exactly what your nooks mean, they're  based off of your past lives!
The Nocks are all your past life’s, Duh
8:35 another clue would be the minimap...
Don't tell me she's gonna die again she always died you could die.
I like the bird origin and I think the little spaces in the base are remains of the other origins
WTF 🤬 i am so confusion confusion what she’s she might have some of the origin for a little bit longer than one day nice I am so confused come back for the mystery she says I can I can already told mystery is male shrines to your old origins oh well hi I don’t know
Lizzie, be careful of Scott. He's an angel now, and since you're a villain, you might be on his radar soon.
Oh no she has become evil, you know if Scott haven't had died I feel she would be his best friend
Well, at least Lizzie was able to survive (kinda) one episode, let’s hope you can survive again-
Lizzie finally find a cool mob but two minutes and she dies LOL
what a mysterious episode!
There can’t be an episode without Lizzy dying
All the rooms are the origins she used to have (:
join the villains group with Lauren and vampire
Fun fact : some of her nooks are based off her previous lives
I felt like the little nooks were a part of your previous lives in afterlife, like the end floran, when you were a racoon, and all the others
The walls in your new place are memories of past origins or others.
Then i'm a problem solving genies
The corner mystery is all your life’s that you lost which is a lot
I guess the real mystery is : Will Lizzie live for two consecutive episodes without losing her origin ? This is what we will find out in the next episode..
10:56 Lizzie trying to swear for first time🤬😂
Is it just me, or is there a pan flag on her skin and in her house?
Classic lizzy a bit of mysterious- Ness and a bit of cuteness:)
This is why i love lizzy:Oh no my only weakness being weak
your videos always surprise me 😦
enigma ballz
I'm fairly sure all the decorations are representing her previous origins
2:42 How fitting that people couldn’t find out your origin you were a literall enigma my personal head cannon is you died some many times they all formed one origin
All the nooks are the different organs that you’ve been.
Lizzie you need to stop dying every episode lol
so lizzie about those decorations, they look suspiciously like your past origins maam
i wanna say                                                                                                                                                                             pathetic.
Oh the secret room were all of her lives
The first one is the raccoon the second one is the parrot
go to the jungle and go S/N
OMG I FRICKIN CALLED IT I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE A PARROT!!!!!!
Some of the mystery are her old lives.
I feel like all the stuff in your secret base represents either some peoples origins or either your previous origins but judging by the red wall and a stick and a Spruce sampling I’m guessing that represents your First origin the raccoon so process of elimination means that the other ones represent your other origins! I beat your problem Lizzie YOU Owe me a heart!  (Jk You don’t have a heart if you don’t want to)
I love how Lizzie themed the nooks on her past lifes
As someone who loves orange, love your base!
I love this video ur Origen is sooo cute
title: I can fly!  2 minutes later: not anymore.
I loved this video
I know what you are making
I WAS JOKING WHEN I SAID IN THE NEXT YOULL LAST LESS THAN AN EPISODE NO😭😭
You think i,m missing a video from you
not me realizing that those decorations were her different origins through the series XD
I think this is the first time lizzie almost dropped an f bomb and its to a hostile pig😂
I love how the internet literally went mad trying to leak your origin
bro
Lizzie: I might be the very first person to win a staring contest with an enderman People who use boats: 😲
I am a problem solving genus apparently because that decor is themed on all her past origins
Lizzie u are my fav youtuber im always so happy when u post!!
The enigma origin is literally just Lizzie in her pure form, tricky and and manipulative but solely for kicks and giggles 😂
Her secret headquarters has parts from her past life
Lizzie, STOP DYING u got no life's left
and does ur headquarters represent your past lives?
Amazing 🤩
The pretty biome was a trap
Oh Lizzie… I guess we can officially add holes to her short list of weaknesses 😂
This is my favourite orgin
I’m kinda getting bored of this just saying….
It's all her past origins in that room as soon as I saw her put down the slime I was like "*GASP* it's her past origins"
Ahahahahhah
I fast forwarded the vid to the end to see if she would die because I thought it would happen again at this point, I was relieved to see she didn't die  And then I watched the first part of the video.
AAAA THE PARROT IS SO CUTE
Yaya finally Lizzie got to keep an origin for more than an episode yaya
Me before I watched the video: *PLEASE DONT DIE PLEASE DONT DIE* Me after watching the video: finally a normal video without death...
I hope Lizzie will stay as an enigma for longer than her other origins
For once, Lizzie didn’t die at the end of the episode… just the beginning 😂😂😂
The moment she said a bird I got the puzzle
10:57 no one :LDshadowlady almost cursed
I KNEW IT
ldshadowlady please be careful you keep on dying------
Finally I was asking my mom to watch it  right now it is 11:00 pm. LOL. I am such a fan.
Lizzie the map, they can see and locate your base
Tbh I love the knucks because it's all of lizzies origins                                                                                                                              why did u kill scott
her headcourters is decorated as all her orgins in the past
Lol
She short again
OMG 😱 Lizzie just a tip never die again
Whys enigma SO COOL?! I wanna play with origins
What a fast death
3 hours early 😂
THE NOOKS ARE WHAT YOU PREVOUSE LIFESSS
I can fly! *2second later* I died. IN A HOLE
Lizzie, u r quite an enigma, but I think the little nooks resemble all of your past origins lol! btw I love your new origin, it's so mysterious!🤔🤫
SHE DIDN'T DIE DURING THE END OF THE EPISODE!!!
Can i just say  YOU'VE SHOWN UR LOCATION WHEN U WERE COMING OUT!!!!
So how many deaths is this 7?
I hope you don’t mind me asking but I have a theory of why you’re dying so fast are you dying so fast in the game so you can get on planning Minecraft empires SMP season 2 ???
YES! Finaly ORANGE! I love orange soo much thank you Lizzie for making an INCREDIBLE ORANGE room/base. Yours Truly Oranges.
The little nukes are her old ordgans and homes
Great video Lizzie I can’t wait to see the next episode of you being an enigma Also for anyone who’s confused about her house its all her previous lives
The decorations are all of her lives that she lived but she died in the lives and now she died as the bird so she needed a bird there
Your past life's
Lizzie you are best youtuber your youtube videos are great I love your all videos 😃 😊 I feel bad that lizzie didn't get much time to fly as a bird
Can you do empires season 2 as your next series please lol
I thought she was gonna die two times in the video
Please use your clone ability, it will save your life so much
Ugh i am so crying rn to see Lizzy died again and she can't tame and she can't kill people with weapons ahhhhh!!!!!
Lizzie is only going to be able to make like 12 episodes
she’s so cute but so creepy team villain league lizzy thrive with a fellow villain and rule the after life!
I don’t belong in a cave I’m a birb what is the meaning of this
ITS SO COOLLL 😯😯
The rooms are based off of Lizzie’s past origins
Its ez
LDshadowlady is soooooooo amazing! :)
Lizzie death counter: 5
Lizzie please don't die
Did you seriously just make a room about all your past lives
Why took so long i was waiting
“Oh no! My one weakness! Being weak!” LDenigmalady, 2022
Wow died twice in episode 8 [like Smallishbeans/Joel] like husband and wife
Lol this video was posted the day before I got a bird
Lizzie is now a birb! ( well- for awhile.. )Maybe now a crow, but I'm sure Phil will still be happy :)
Lol it's 1am now for me
What if she could kill the ender dragon or wither with the laser vision thing
Those walls she decorated show her past lives
woo
definitley  the beast episode yet, shes great at being the villan
I wanna assume the decorations are from each life u had
The fact that she went from living as a bird to killing the bird’s was a complete tone shift…
ur still ganna get banned first
we all know whos getting out first
❤️
lizzie either has 2 or 3 lives left. she is gonna be the last one eliminated. i bet $30 she will be eliminated first.
Lizzy is it every  episode u must die?
Pls don't die easily
10:58 what the fu-blazes is that... lol
The fact that the video happened to be exactly 13 minutes old. 0_0
Is it me or every episode Lizzy dies and has a new life 🤣🤣🫠🫠 we love her just the same tough ❤️❤️❤️❤️
LIZZIE ALMOST SWORE?! HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR AN ADULT WOMAN TO NEARLY SWEAR ON A CHILD FRIENDLY CHANNEL!!!!! I’m appalled 😤😤 /j /j /j /j
Tell me why Lizzie Enigma Skin gives me Gojo Vibes from the anime jujutsu kaisen 😂
The mysterious Lizzie is awesome 👏
i am Smool very very Smool
Does anyone know what shaders Lizzie uses?
noooo becareful lizzy you only got 5 lives
I understand the nooks, the one that has the parrot represents her life as a parrot, the one with crazy pumpkins and random things is her life as an enigma, the one with the red and frame is her raccoon life, and the one with the crystals is her Alien life, then the one with the brown is her kangaroo life, and lastly is her end flower life.
Rip Birb Lizzie, I hope you enjoyed your 2 minutes 15 seconds of life
Round of applause for Lizzie because she survived an episode with a new origin
Birds: let’s just reject her and get the other birds to stand right in the place that we were it for she can kill them                           Lonely bird: killed      Lizzie: ahhh perfect
Ldmysteriolady :D
I think each nook is a life she has had! :)
Lizzie, please stop dying, it’s not healthy.
This is about to a 10 episode series 😭💀
seriously there is finally an episode that doesn't end in death...even though it wad involved
My minecraft username is Annag146288
I will friend you on minecraft
Finalllyyyy! Yeeey new video!!
Hi Lizzie! I was the girl on origin realms server that was in your skin. Don’t know if it was the real you or not but my birthdays coming up and all I ever wanted was a cameo from you but you don’t have an account so I want to put in a request that you make an account
I know why you did the “decorations” like that: the one whit the red wall is when you where a racoon(they like trash) the multi coloured one is LDshadow lady’s birb life and the other one is the alien life
Anybody else getting KingdomCraft vibes from the second half of this episode?
There all her old life’s
Hi Lizzie my name is Anna I’m a big fan i would really like to play mc with you I’d really appreciate it
Lizzie almost swears
Every nook represents the origins she's been?? I'm pretty sure anyways.
finally no cliff hanger
I've been waiting for this
I feel like this is the first episode in a while that Lizzie hasn’t ended it on a cliffhanger of death
I have a feeling she wont last long...
I know exactly what those decoration mean
It for all your origins
OOOH THE DESIGHN OF HER SECRET BASE REPRESENTS ALL HER ORIGINS
At 10:59 when Lizzie said: “What the Fffff—- blazes is that?!
It's fot all get origins
I feel like Lissie would be one of those villian's that murder people and then leave mysterious clues behind like riddler or something. She would be the scariest villian for the guardians of the afterlife to face.
I think lizzie has started tot o take so many chances and show off so much that she keeps dying. I love it!! ❤
the enigma headquarters is a mix of every origin
I feel like every episode Lizzy dies 😂
This is a nice series.
What tf did I just witness
Iv been waiting for this video my whole life
Aww each room represents one of her lives
You spawned in a desert because the kangaroo origin spawns in the desert on death
Bruh how did you die again (no offence)
It’s so sad that Lizzie keeps dying-
YAYYYY I WAS CHECKING UR YT THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND U FINALLY UPLOADED!!
Ah yes a birb..... Nevermind
Origins is the base of all them
They are all of the origins that she's ever been
Um.. Lizzie almost said “ what the f***” did anyone catch that? Or am I hearing things?
The base is all the place/ pgins
I’ve been waiting for this!
I am a mastermind, I figured out Lizzie's decorations! they're nods toward all her previous Lives, one as a Raccoon, one as a Florian, one as a Goolian, one as a Kangaroo, one as a Parrot and I assume the rest is her Enigma life!
There is never to much orange
Lizzie is going to be the first to be kicked off the smp😭😂
I'm pretty sure that the  nucks are lizzies origins
the wall is a reminder of her past lives?
Omg- Lizzie noticed the fandoms idea of trying to find out her origin let’s be honest we all guessed that sorta ig
There could be a five person totem pole Ant Inchling Birb Normal sized player Giant
Does it repusent all if her past Origins
Lizzy has fully became an enigma
🦜🦜🦜🦜
yo can somebody like get me a count of how many times lizzie has died?
On the bright side of dying all the time, u get to try loads of different skins 😂🧞‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧝🏻‍♀️🦸‍♀️👩‍🎤   Also after her empires cove of wonders and now this new base I’m starting think Lizzie might have a hoarding problem (or at least in MC)
After the adventure in the last episode u spawned in a desert but now kangaroo Lizzie is dead………
Lizzie's about to become the new bad guy
I LOVE THE PANSEXUAL LEGGGGG
'You thought you could escape me'- The waye she said it was sinisterly
You don't know how long I had to wait
does no one see the pan flag on her enigma skin???
Omg girl stop dyinggggg 😭
10:57 ldshadowlady almost saying f word 💀📷
This is the league of villains but alot more creepy
lizzie definitely watched the new batman film before filming this sinister bird hunting ep
All The corners in her base On the block she used in her past lives
I assume the nooks are for every life you've had?
Well,that was ok but that was a quick death
i really hope she stays an enigma for more than an episode because its such a cool origin
You  have 5 more lives left
Hah I got the mistery all the walls symbolize her past lives
Guys I solved the mystery she build things to onner her past lives
she decorated with her past origins I realized this when she started building the goolian (not sure if that is how you spell it)
she made a base with all the roles she used to be... I'm impressed.
There all based on ur past origins
I know what the decorations means of 9:46 it’s the power and animals she was
stop dying you have like 2 lifes left
ITSA BIRB NOT A BIRD I LOVE BIRBSSSSS
The mystery in her secret base are her past origins
The mystery in her secret base are her past origins
By the way I love lizzys YouTube channel
Why does it says birb for bid
LIZZY!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I NEVER GOT TO MESSAGE/COMMENT BUT NOW I CAN!!!!!!!!!!
The next skin is gonna be some thing whit horns
Ride other players very sus😂
Her secret base isn't that misterias, you can obviously see it's all the origins she had in after life
Lizzie u gotta stop dieing💀
Anyone agree that Lizzie's gonna be the first to lose all 10 lives-? Not insulting tho
i saw your near spawn the mini map is a snich a sneaky snich
Yes Finally a new video!!!  :>
Lizzie i understand your nooks :)  Its all your past lives  Also i love your videos
I understood the design as soon as I saw the top it was a memorial or something to show her old lived also she didn’t die in this episode
LIZZIE STOP DYING
10:57
pls lizzie dont go back to the end or nether it means danger i dont want u to leave the series so early ps:u and katherine have the best vids
Lizzie: Who am I kidding, the real mystery is how I have stayed alive for so long.  Me: Mhm
be careful Lizzie! Only 5 lives left!
All the knocks represent one of her previous lives
10:57 she almost said wtf but before she said the f word she stopped lol
who knew, all lizzie needed to live is a mischievous and/or evil origin
Yeah! Another birb!!!!!! Wooohh!!!
She literally went out of the falls and the falls was just near the spawn haha literally !😂
10:57 what the f- blazes is that!?!
well lizzie... i kinda like this 'new' you
The underground bunker reminds me so much of kingdomcraft!
I love this series so much!!
FINALLY ty for uploading
It’s her old origins but what is the book shelf’s
No one gonna talk about how she said “What the f—blazers is that”
I love how at the end it all got creepy and then the outro was so up beat!
I was about to say yay Lizzie didn’t die in the episode then I remembered the parrot
Ooooooo
Each area Eli have shown was part of her life a birb - a colorful creature that is very fragile yet so strong A alien - that lives in the weirdest biome but so bright A raccoon - a animal that loves collecting trash A floran - a challenging life and yet so interesting  A kangaroo - another animal that loves to be annoying but yet people still love her....
Ooooooo
New record
I KNOW WHAT THE NOOKS STAND FOR! But so that it will stay mysterious and secret, I will not tell. Your welcome for not telling!
I love this series! Lizzie! You keep the escense of your chapters! Can you at some point marry Joel again?
Lizzie amost said a no no word.
How many lives does Lizzie have again?
I just started this video but I feel like she dies in 2 seconds
10:57 lizzie did u almost swear?💀
I guessed all the mysterious reasons already :)
I love how very extra detailed houses she made in the past but ended up dying in no time. But it's fine, it makes the series more interesting and addictive!
I dont know why but I feel like she is going to die next episode. (*d*)
lizzie: for purposes you wont onderstand me: its all your past origins :|
hi 2 hrs late
The decorations is your old origins!!!!
Honestly expected another death at the end of the episode
I know why you did that
lizzie has bad luck
I think that Lizzie’s secret waterfall base is literally at spawn. I mean, the water fall needed a mountain to flow water down, and the spawn has lots of mountains!
my new favourite lizzie quote (right after  "why do you have three fridges? what kind of a person needs three fridges") "WHAT THE F-------       -----....BLAZES IS THAT???"
I feel like the nooks in Lizzie's new base are reminders of her past origins. They all seem to have something to do with them. The cow headed area is her racoon, the pumpkin area was her Florian, the amethyst area was her alien, the one with the stick was probably her kangaroo, the wool area was her parrot, and the last one I've yet to understand; the book shelves.
I’ve figured out what her base represents! It’s all of her origins! Plus I can explain all of them just in case someone doesn’t get it. The cow and boat wall is for the annoying kangaroo pranks, the pumpkin and flowers are for her End Floridian life, the amethyst and lightning rods are for her goolidian life, the red and black wall is for her first life; the raccoon, and ofc the parrot head and colors are for the life she just died in!
Lizzie u just showed us were u made it
I love your video!
The little holes were every origin she had
10:57 LIZZARD aka miss lizzie✨🌺 almost swear, anyways she already said she does.
I love birds!
This reminds me of the kingdom craft series!
I BELIEVE I CAN FLYYT I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE BIRD BRETHEREN
Lizzie nearly swore
i’m so exiteddddd! i hooe she doens’t die in this epesode again i love them there still amazing im sad if it has to enddddd btw whats whit the other skins she had?
Welp that was a short bird life 🥲
Hiii
As soon as you built the decorations near 10:25 I knew exactly that those were your past lives in your headquarters and I love it!
i laughed so many times throughout this lmao there were so many good jokes
I THINK she MIGHT have based the decorations on her past lives but IDK so yeah like I said I THINK
Please don't  die next episode!!! 🙏 Oh please holy goddess protect Lizzie!
YES TWO OF MY FAVORITE THINGS COMBINED :DDD
Little do you know the secret of the small spaces is her past lifes
Nooo that was a fast death
Lizzie needs a bodyguard at this point lol
YOU DID IT YOU SURVIVED A WHOLE EP ITS BEEN SO LONG
I understand fully!? :D
Let’s hope Lizzie lasts atleast 2 more episofes
I can't wait to see more of Enigma Lizzie, favourite origin for her so far. Then again, I like villains so kind of a biased opinion I suppose
The nooks are based off of your past origins
Is it birb?
You did fly....
Just finished the vid, OH SHE FRICKIN’ EVIL! (singsong) I looooove iiiit!
finally she didnt die at the end
This episode was stressful lol
I think I speak for everybody when I say we love your content a lot! The only thing is I wish you posted a bit more consistently! It would mean a lot to your viewers! Love you❣️ like if you agree ⬇️
I think those little  nooks show off all of Lizzie’s previous origins
TODAY?!? First time bein kinda early but this is amazing yet again 💫
I was waiting for this ep.
You're making your last origins
You really should steal Scott’s book of death. It would help you take over the world
The base is based off of all her past origins
Ur base has some stuff from previous lives!
Can you just pls stop dying I don’t want this over yet.
There from every Origen  you have died from
I love how Lizzie represented her past orgims.
Rip       Ldsadowlady bird
If you dont know the little nooks are decorated to resemble her past lives
I understand the nooks
Please don't die.
I was gonna comment something alone the line of "I haven't watch the video yet but I bet she would die". I regret not doing that now. (Lizzie why?)
I think the mysterious stuff in ur home was based on the theme of all your other life’s hosues
are we going to ignore the pan flags in izzy’s skins this vid
:0 I love birds :D
I like how her new sjin is a combination of almost all of previous ones
Finally I've been waiting for like years
“My one weakness!… being weak!” Haha
The nooks are your origins
The nooks are your origins
What app did u use for the mod?
I need to see Lizzie kill a player mysteriously 😭
I think what Lizzie built in her secret house is all of the things you can be after dying or the things she has been, like for example…. the bambo, she Was a raccoon and for the bird head and the three colors, she was a bird just in the begging of the episode.
I hate the fact that she dies evry episode
yea we all know she will be the fist out of all her lives its hard core try to servive she is loossing lives all the time
Finally an episode where she didn't die at the end
I am early I am early oh yeah early
Pin pls?
I’m at 10 mins 41 seconds in an thinking “death-orations, eh?”
I was only hoping this episode wouldn’t end in a death, well I guess I got what I wanted, XD
10:58 Lizzie! Language!!
All of the rooms are her old Origins
This is my first time actually hearing Lizzie about to say f### but I’m glad she’s family friendly
noo
WE SAID NOT TO GO. IN THEREEEEEEEE NOT  LIZZY NO
Bruh I just realized that the nook represents all of her past origins
WOOOO! I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO SO LONG
I KNOW WHAT THOSE SECRET NOOKS ARE! THEY REPRESENT HER PAST LIVES 1. Raccoon 2. Florian 3. Gooolien 4. Bird
Like I just wanna say- she’s gotta join Lauren in the Villain Club XD
Classic lizzie 🌚😭
Hi
She Put A Little Part Of Her Past Houses In Her Past lives in this base
THE END WAS REAL SPOOKY AND CREEPY LIZZIE BRAVO!!! LMAO
She also agrees that she died to many times😭👍
i really want you to just aggressively kill people next episode, specifically how many times you died = how many people you kill
Love it but I would like it if you posted more because I waited so long and I was like I'm going to rip the world apart
I think the mysterious 3x3 areas show her past lives
I figured the decorations instantly. Lizzy you are so predictable
The little nooks are your past lifes
As a big YouTuber its nearly impossible Eli will heart this
Hiii
Can this life be all about not dying? Please! your like i dont know.. on 4 or 3???
Oh it's  5 origins if you include  the  bird depending  on how  long it  lasted for
Oh, wow, lizzie went evil at the end there.... that was very unexpected. I wonder if she will join Scott's league of villains
FINALLY ! After 2 weeks! 2 WEEKS!
First I thaught that Lizzie was gonna survive a whole episode, about 3-5 minutes into it I relized I was wrong... 🤐
Girl, ain't no such thing as too much orange
Her decorations in her house are all of her old origins
Yayyy Lizzy didn't die as an enigma woahhhh
the little rooms are supposed to describe your past lifes
Please dont die again
The mysterious small rooms are her past lives!!!
Please do more shadowqween 🥺
Me : LIZZY  U DEADDD AGAIN PLS BE CAREF UL OOOOOF
10:57 what the f— Edit： this is not hate I love her videos and her being family friendly
Haha I am smart love ❤  Mariela
my only weakness!!!!! being weak lmaooo sjdkfnsdfdsbasn
I CAN FIY for only 2 minutes
the rooms= all her lifes
Lizzie Truly deserves the award for “Shortest Lived Life”
Lizzie you should join scots club of villens(you can litrilly stair poeple to death)ps you and schot could make a realy good team
Omg I actually understand those nooks in her base
lizzie you really gotta stop changing ur skins before ur video comes out... i have seen them all
Hi
NO NOT THE PARROT
WHY!!!
I now  every decoration hole in the  wall is for all 4 of the origins you have lived  through
LIZZIE SURVIVED ONE EPISODE AS SOMETHING!!!! Everyone CHEER                   (We’re going to ignore the birb incident)
She finally didn’t die! ❤️‍🩹✨
I  rember  it's   your   ather   life's
All of your lives  are on the walls .,.
The tiny rooms are for her old lives
All her origins. nice
I saw the thumbnail and said to myself  “Lizzie is now a parrot 🦜 Oh wait but she dies. Right?”
dangit i was so happy for lizzy to be a bird...
the mysterious declaration is the blocks she use in her pass life
How come you always know the theme of your house lizzy
I love how in almost every episode you end up dieing at least once
all the nooks are of her past origans
Bird: No Birb: Yes
Really hoped she wouldn't die this episode but oh well
The nooks where Lizzie's old origins Edit: ALSO GOOD JOB LIZZIE FOR NOT DIEING ON YOUR ORGIN FOR ONE EPISODE (not the parrot)
I know what you tried to fo
All the nooks in her base is based off of all her past origins
I love how evil Lizzie is in every origin
I think I know the nuts they are all the things Lizzy has been
Bruh
I’ve just started this video she better not die by the end of this
10:02 they are her origins that she had before
She died so quickly
I love how lizzie build her new house! It all inspired to all of her origin! That was an amazing idea! And it's cute too! I love it!
YOUR DECORATION IS BASED ON YOU ORIGINS BEFORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I miss one life kingdomcraft was 2 years ago already empires I miss that too crazy Craft even
I think she must have spawned in the desert because of the kangaroo origin, it said that when she died she would go to a desert
She made all those nooks because of the previous life's she had
I love how her house is designed by her different Origens. Idk if I spelled that right
I know the sector to the base 😏 your smart
Why the bird I cry
I love the bird design because not sure how many people realized this but it was the pan flag <3
I think other channels spoiled this but I still got very excited when I saw this
So Scotts is no longer the big bad villain it's Lizzy okay
that room is for her origons that she died in
Ok, haven’t watched the video yet, and if she dies, I will cry. Coming back later
|  V 🎟 Claim your here before 3 hour ticket here.
I think the nooks are your past lifes
LIZZY STOP DYING PLEASE
i know for a fact lizzies gonna die by accidently eating a cookie.
Best role yet!
each of the rooms she has are each of her lives😌
I thought this will be the episode that lizzie won’t die i guess i was wrong 🙄
Liz u always change skin?? Love u lizz and i love birdss andddd ur build reminds me of Joel's empire in empires!!! And the deal with destiny area is back!!!
at 10 minuets and 30 xeconds into the video i understood what her decorations ment it is her different origin on display
10:00 is it all of lizzies past origins???
"Oh no my one weakness! Being weak!" Lizzie ily
.
That’s all the lives she had knows all her little mysteries are all the lives that she had
this series 🤝 an onslaught of super fun skins
She nearly swore- i find with it dont worry ldshadowlady
Lizzie: "How am I supposed to take over the server if I can't even kill a ghast?" Me: *Looking at the bar where her armor is supposed to be: "um.." Love your videos Lizzie! 💘
i believe i can fly
HER VILLAIN ORIGIN STORY
10:57 She almost swore :')
Nobody: Lizzie: “This is the second time i’ve almost been killed by a pig today.
LIZZIE Stop Dying At The End Of Every Episode your gonna lose all your lives ヽ(*。>Д<)o゜
Why why 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
oh my god please stop dyingggg !!!
😎 cool
ITS A BIRD NO ITS A PLANE NO ITS PARROT LIZZIE
lizzy saying if you figure this out your a genuis its just stuff from your past lifes wait this means im smart
Lizzie stop dying
Lizzie: IMMA BIRBBBB  Zombie: not anymore.
each decoration resembles each origin except the kangaroo
Mysterious Reasons😂 \ All your past origans and deaths
STOP I LOVED THE BIRD ORIGIN AND IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US SO FAST LMFAO NOOOO
😨
WE NEED MORE AMOUNG US STREAMS SINCE THERE IS UPDATES
Wow she died instantly *sigh* Lizzie when will you learn!?
Did annyone elce realize she had a pansexual flag on her sock? Its a cool litle detail.
I just realized Lizzie could prank her friends on the server who don't know what her origin does lol
lizzie plsss dont die again at least not soon we dont want this series to be short😅
The mystery of her past life. Also, if she could stay alife for a little longer she could turn into a scientist instead of a villain by discovering that she had past lives and those disorders that come to her head is a message. She will be the only one that feels that this is not the afterlife this is a simulation of some kind
you should take revenge on lauren and stare her to death
Ah now. I'm scared lol
DON'T EVER TAKE A BREAK FOR SO LONG ME AND MY SISTER WERE WORRIED!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂
I know the mystery of the decorations! im right now when your trying to tame a bird i can tell  your making all the houses you made in your past lifes
10:57  "What the ffff ...".   She realised what she wants about to say and just stopped
Yesssssss it's here I am crying
finally she didn't leave the episode on a complete cliffhanger...
After lizzy died I had my mouth open for like 20 mins😨
Another origin that fits lizzie!! I love that skin sm aswell!
Love when people take effort to make these videos
OMG I love your vids so much and I just realized why the nooks were those specific things cuz it was your old origins! keep up what you are doing we all love it!❤❤💛🧡
Finally
This is a prediction on what the decor is don't read all of it if you don't want it to be spoiled (I think everyone knows it tho lol)               The decor is her passes lived
I’m late 🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜
When Lizzie said f
whos wants to bet she dies next episode?
I already found out the strangeness all your lives raccoon with the small area and garbage items the florin with the plant life and bee hive the goolian with the goo biome parts and the kangaroo with the cow heads am too smart for u
I just started this episode, but let's hope Lizzie can keep this origin for longer than an episode. Also let's hope she doesn't kill herself by flying into something like Shelby.  Edit: I'm two minutes in and she already flew into something and ended up dying.
"What the f- blazes is that?"
But she has a mini map in her secret base
Plis dont Die
each spot is a origin that ldshadowlady has been
U should get a parrot and put it on ur shoulder
Btw if you don’t get what all the little decorations in the walls are it’s her past origins
Ohhh the mystery is that the nooks are her past lifes
the nooks represent her previous lives
O M G  I LOVE PARROTS/BIRBS  AND I HAVE A PARROT 🦜 Sad that you died super early:(
I was so scared she would die the entire time
Lizzie did you forget that after 10 deaths you can’t be on the server anymore
Wait the decorations are her past lifes.
Ohhh all of the n0oks are all your origins that you've had before! 😮
I know way she decorated the nooks like that they resemble all her origans
your secret should have what killed the secret
YAAAAAAAAAY A NEW ESPISODE!!!
I love the idea you did for your house and I am surprised that you did not die a 3rd time!
imagine just trying to go to the nether,but instead of just going to the nether with peace you see a weird scary skull snake death guarding the portal😂
BRO THE NOOKS ARE HER PAST LIFES HOMES/BOIMES
The decorations are her previous lives
FINALLY ANOTHER ORIGIN THAT LASTED A FULL EPISODE
nnnnn
This video is really funny and I think I might know why you have those decorations each one for the place you lived or your life that you lived
wow
The nooks were your past lives
well it’s obviously her death’s that she put there
"Oh no my one weakness,being weak."~ldshadowlady
Are the nooks meant represent you past lives?
Lizzie I think you forgot about the map in the top left…
Woah I love it you was a little rancon and then a kangaroo and now this haha now a enigma hope you don't die again 😃
You could even beat the end dragon easily.l.
OML you died
I just love how Lizzie truly brings life to each origin, but how she never truly tries to die on purpose. It just happens instantaneously.
The fact I understood the "nooks" were to represent her past lives
Yesssssss SHE DID’T DIE
The mysterious things are all her origins I figured that put the first timr I saw her build it
each nook=every origin lizzie has been. just in case y'all didnt get it
Hey LDShadowLady I wanted to know if you could do more among us videos and afterlife because those are my two favourite series and you are my first YouTuber that I saw and I really would like to watch more videos but I have nothing to watch I can just re-watched
Evry time jou died  is wan of this dicerisen
:0
the end was kinda scary
You can join Lauren she's alone now
what the f-.........blazes is that?!
You should be part of the villain league because this power seems so evil
I really really really wanna see her troll other players with this new origin
For once she didn't end up dieing at the end a parot did instead
Gosh I hope she doesn’t die in the next episode this may be the best origin yet!
Evry room is dedecet to one of you livse
SQUARK
The nooks are the resent lives
THE NOOKS ARE MADE TO REPRESENT HER ORIGINS
She is on her last life guys
I love your videos Lizzie and how you try to stay alive but you always end up dying in some way. Keep working hard!
HOW DO YOU ALWAYS DIE?!OMG
OHHHH all the little nooks are her past origens! IM A GENIUS
Am I the only one that thinks she’s pan cuz her skin is like the pan flag? Lol hahah (no offense to lgbtq+, I support and don’t hate)
Lizzie is flying through these lives... Sorry....but nobody can beak that -R.I.P Lizzie- Aww Cakaw sake no more puns! --- Enigma arrives  😈
THE FIRST VIDEO
Look she’s not dead in the same episode! 👏🏻
*dies in the first 2 minutes* 😂💖🌸
PAST ORGINS!!!
Love how you made a little section for each of your origins
I think lizzie hates this series lol
I love how she put all her past origins in her base as a remembrance😄  Cow heads and a boat - Kangaroo Origin Bee Hive and Plants - Floran Origin Amethyst Blocks and Copper Rods - Goolian Origin Composter and Stick Frame - Raccoon Origin Colorful Wall and a Parrot Head - Bird Origin
Early!
Please don’t die more
Omg Lizzy u are so cute
I MISS YOU SOO MUCH I LOVE UR VIDEO
You are actually a parent but it's cute
the moment she said "I need to collect a bird for here"..I get it that it's about her past lives.. I was like "OHHHH I get it noww"
I think the milk set in her walls represents her past lifes
I really hope u continue to survive as an enigma for a while the endless pranks that could be done is great!!!
NOW try.not.to.die 😡 again >:(
She kept her origin we kinda
If only Lizzie did somthing cool with her decoration spaces like leave momentos of her past lives.
Rule No.1 don't look behind you Rule No.2 don't look behind you  Rule No.3 don't look behind you
I get what lizzie did with her base she made the decorations based off her orgins :)
Shadowlady is really coming in shape!
BTW I love your origin youshould work for evil Inc. With Scott and lauren
"My own weakness,being weak" -Lizzie/LDShadowLady
I love how you made each room your past origins. Yes, I have solved the mystery
It pains me how many times Lizzie dies
wait, that's it? but that's too short. I don't even know when she met sausage.
each nook is a think for how you died
I Love Villain Lizzie she was so cute as a parrot 🦜 but I love this new Origin
I think you should add a room to plan all your evil antics
Yep they are definitely racing with Joel who is gonna end their series first 😝
Lizzie has just become a villain Who loves to kill mobs not people
YOU SURVIVED 1 EPISODE! YAY
We will give you 5 million likes of you post the next video in two days
YAY LIZZIE
So, some advice:  Shelby and Joey are currently the only members of the Guardians of the Afterlife (aka Good Guy Group), so if you have to interact with them, try to keep your evilness a secret.  You can't rely on Scott or Lauren for help, either, since they've both died. This goes double for Scott, who's now a vengeance-and-holy-fire type angel - aka no real moral code.  However, Scott still has a book in his old vampire manor with everyone's weaknesses. I would recommend a stealth trip over there before he catches wind of you being evil and hides or destroys it.
I love all Ldshadowladys content and especially her humor, the only sad part is how long it takes her to upload Bc I love each and every video she makes!
Revenge. You deserve revenge. Teleport behind Lauren or really anyone who has betrayed you, and wait for the staring to really kick in.
Thanks so much for uploading again!
Para a pessoa que esta lendo isso: Espero que você consiga realizar todos os seus desejos esse ano!! Amém!! 😊🙏💘💥
what are some of the mods?
SHE KANGAROO RESPAWNED IN DESERT
Lizzie please don’t die
Those are her Origins from Her past lives
I LOVR THI
Oh you know those nooks. The things in them represent all her origins

I bet your going to die. Next ep
Lizzie plz wear armor
You should Totally join the Villain Club now that you am have a Villainous origin!!
The smp should be called don't die.
I just realized ur prob able to use a bow cuz the thing never mentioned not being able to use a bow
11:12 2 alternative ways to escape would be to climb up the vines or use her origin to phase into the ground-  huge props to Lizzie for teleporting away when in such a tricky moment
Don't wanna assume anything but there is a pan flag on her leg😭
I honestly think that the decorations are based off all of her origins and honestly I love watching you I mean I thought that the way you tried to kill that pig your just like "Any minute now death will consume you"
Lizzie I love your video
Yo
The nooks r ur past lives
So is the nice lizzy just turned into the demon we all knew it would happen one day
Lizzie those life seem to be shortening
Please put another episode I’ve been waiting for this episode for a long timeeeeeeee!!!
I love THiS it is AMZING
She finnaly posted 😭 it like living hell waiting....
Yes oh yes Lizzie is back guys after so long I love your vids
Show me an episode of Lizzie that she does not die.
I like your dedication to your origins. The Trash-Service, living in the End, the alien-biom, etc. You do a marvellous job.
Omg she actually survived one episode
Omg she actually survived one episode
Imagine decoding all of those weird things in her new base, but their true meaning is literally "nothing" at all🤣🤣     But honestly though... IT'S MAKING ME THINK SO HARD!!!!😅🤡
Your not that mistryrious you know I know what are the meaning of those decors you know Lizzy heh heh HEH HEH HEH
She lasted 2 whole minutes as a bird
Lizzie anyways has the shortest life but always makes it worth it!!💖🌟
The decorations are in memory of past lives cow heads and boat= kangaroo the little bee area
atleast she did not die only once lol new record
OMG 😱 she almost said a bad word on a kids channel
10:57 WHAT THE F- BLAZES
Let’s just hope Lizzie actually ends up surviving the next episode
Evil Lizzie scares me
Wow the nooks don't resemble her past lives at alll, nooo
I’m so happy for Lizzie and that she didn’t die
Are you going to join the villains club?? Take revenge on Lauren as well?🧐
She survived five episodes on 1 heart, yet she can’t survive 3 minutes with a eytra
why does Lizzy sound so scary...? I'm scared :( she is scary at 12:34 😓
The nooks in LDShadowLady’s base is meant to represent each of LDShadowLady’s lives that she REGRETS.
Nooooo she died as a brib
She is just building all of her orgins
Hi
Liz we all know that every little patch in that bace is ur lives that have been lost
LIZZIE DID YOU REALY SAY “WHAT THE FU-
Her lives are dropping like flies 😅
Also… LONG LIVE SHADOW CADETS I HAVE BEEN A SHADOW CADET FOR 3 YEARS
Girl noooooo
Okay, can we all agree this is her coolest origin? Lets hope she doesn’t lose it next episode
The ending was something that would be seen on a Nuke's Top 5 compilation video. 😂 Lizzie makes a perfectly spoopy enigma.😈
12:50 I couldn't see her at all
This is why your skin keeps changing
we love how lizzie is speed running each origin lol
yes! finally
Lizzie's voice was hilarious at the end!
I cried knowing you survived an episode😢😢😢😭😭😭
I think this is the second or third episode you've done where you haven't died at the end.
I think you should make this in a different version with 20 lives 😝
Lizzie: uploads a video. Me: gets cozy to watch it
It's so easy to know what she's doing she's building tiny areas to represent her past life's!
I hope you're going to have a origin at least 5 episode's
once she strted hitting the zombie i knew it was over for the birb
Your new role reminds me of C!Charlie slimecicle
i love the little nooks a nice touch of your pervious origins
My favorite life is the raccoon 🦝! What’s  yours? Also you are my favorite YouTuber! Every time you post I am happy! 😊❤️🍒🌺  pls comment on this post! Your biggest fan ME
I watched a video tryna solve your origins and sombody in the comments said it looked like you fused all your past origins and with the decorations in your lair   how ?!
lizzy speed running her  10 lives
Welp lizzys gone crazy after dying so many times
LIZZIEEEE!!!! STOPPPP DIEEIIIING PLEAAASE!
Are you flipping serious lizzie.
Al of your past life's
I feel so bad for her that she's died every episode
10:56 Close one there, Lizzie, almost became a non-pg channel there
I'm surprised that you survived this episode XD
As a parrot owner I am petrified
Get a song about you ldshadowlady
The base is actually based on all of Lizzys past lives
when is empiers smp number 2 gonna start
Theory from flicking amethyst you keep dying early because you wanna work on empires 2?
HOW ARE YOU DYING SO MUCH
Omg she dies to much😂🤣😂🤣
all the nouks are your past life😁😁😁😁
I’m really excited to see how Lizzie’s villain arc plays out, will she make enemies? Will there be an epic fight with the hero’s? Who knows!
UwU
: b
nooooo
For your house the different rooms are your different houses from the different regions
Very mysterious. Very villainous.
I like the nooks there about her past lives
Lizzie your house has the decoration of the things u became and died
kinda funny XD
She is  a good  youtuber
The colors of the avatar is pansexual lol
Did anybody noticed that Lizzie said: what the f-....what the blazers was that?!
The mystery is that each and every little area is showing what origin she had
I nearly had a heart attack when Lizzie was on 4 hearts. (and whenever she took damage)
LIZZIE PLEASE STOP DIEING
The nooks in our secret base all represent your life
Are they all from your past lives
Hi
I have a question, HOW IS IT EVERY TIME SHE DOES ONE OF THESE SHE DIES.
I just screamed yes at the top of my lungs and my was like are u okay 😂
10:57 oh no lizzie, u almost said it😂😂
R.I.P you’re poor parrot🦜
Hi
great episode but um please survive . I don't want you to run out of lives this early in the series. have a great day lizzie
I love how Lizzie made her house representing her other afterlife origins that she had in the past.
This is so cool
I have not watched the video yet but I will guess that Lizzie will die in this video. If not, then I will be proud  Edit: what did I expect? Long live lizzie the birb
did anyone else realise when it says she has six lives left? does that mean there are only gonna be 6 more episodes 😭😭😭
Am I the only one who noticed that the decorations in Lizzie’s lair all represent her past lives?
Bro how Manny times did ld shadow lady die at this point?
Lol the decoration is a mystery?! There obviously her last lifes
her decorations are all hers life(s)
The decor in lizzies secret base is her past origins!
I am depily sorry for being late but it take such timeeeeeeee but it is so worth it! ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
How many times have you died already-
The little nooks represent all her different lives
I'm from the UK!
Lizzie is bringing the chaos and I am HERE for it. How many lives has she got left? I lost track.
Anyone else notice her socks?
you just put your past life in those holes. . . tho-
Lizzie being a Pan Birb icon:
The decorations were her past life or how she died pretty sure
You don't understand how many times I was screaming Lizzie's name throughout this whole video 😭😂
SHE DIED SO QUICK I LOVED THE BIRD :(
Wow the decorations is definitely not the styles of your past lives
She has had the roughest time on this series
her decor is the lives shes had
I'm so excited to see what you're going to do next
Also Lizzie you need to stop dying your going to be the first one out of the smp
Enigmas makes people question their own sanity but you ended up losing your own sanity
Lizzy is worse than vampire scott
watching lizzie's afterlife smp is like watching a thriller movie, she's always soo close to death XD
Now things will get more mysterious now that she has this origin
I was so excited 😆 for this video
Omg it’s my birthday and i was so happy to see that u posted!🥳
Lizzie your map in the top left corner UR MAP people can find u
What is 'it shows all of your past lives' for 100?
The decor of her baes are her past lives
The walls are her past lifes
Why do I feel like Lizzie will be eliminated first?
Okay ~ this video did contain death.. But didn't end with one -- so plz shadow queen don't die this time 🤧.. This origin seems suspiciously good 👀..   🙂
I like how she made each room her past life’s
your secret are obious
❤️
I feel like this would work better if you only had to reroll your life via a player kill
Those decorations were her origins for the 1 person who didn’t figure that out
For last second I guess Lizzie will be an "Illusioner"  but well birb is cute too  and yeah that not last for too long 😆
I know what there's little decoration areas of Wall It's all your past lives
Lizzy almost said the f word
Now you just need to stare at someone while hiding while they try to build XD Sidenote, angel is probably most likely to get murdered by enigma, because they don't get debuffs, so you might be able to just stare at them and they would spontaniously die without warning
The secret areas are her Irvine she’s been if you noticed!
i think the little spaces represent her old origins.
I see that the video time is 13 minutes: Well, we'll have another death.   Me literally 2 minutes later: ...
When Lizzie made the nooks I think that they represented her past origins
Lizzie go trick Scott by saying that if you look at him long enough that you can teleport him,then kill him!
Lizzie gets the cutest origins for real! …But then instantly dies…
It’s all of her lives for the “decorations”  This might be the last life-
I swear if she dies again 😭😭
A new villain has blossomed opon the after life server
The nooks are of the lives shes had before
Your daughter is sleeping with my husband your daughter is sleeping with my husband your daughter is sleeping with my husband nabuntis ni David ang anak nyo at pumunta sya sa Amerika para Ipa abort ang bata
Why does she die so often
Well I expect her to be a villain
I was sleeping and I just woke up and thought to go on YouTube you had a new video and I am excited
I love this, and I’m sorry abt the parrot origin it was rlly cute! But I’m excited to see more of the enigma origin and I have a good feeling this origin will last much longer
Lizzy would the little map in the corner  show where the Secret base is?
Birb
When will your next video be
YAYYY!!! FINALLY
“You thought you could escape me, but you were wrong…” That is, officially, *the* creepiest statement Lizzie has ever said…
🦋🌸✨🍡
🌸✨🦋🍡
she finally suvived an episode (kinda..) xD
Yes this is what what I’ve been waiting for
I just now realized the little nooks in her house were her past origins
🍡🦋🌸✨
DONT LOSE THIS ONE JUST STOP DYING  UGHHHHHH
I think she is forgetting one of her most dangerous abilities: the Clone. Make a copy. Explode the copy. That, and teleporting behind her foes.
Lizzy, we all know what you're basing your base off of it's all the origins you had. 😀😀lol
lizzie what is this mod called?
Oh I think ur decorations are based on your previous lives
Bro is no one gonna talk about Lizzy almost swearing
Me I feel like she is going to die while flying
I think Lizzie wants to end this series
Hello ld shodylady i am sorry if i splled your name wrong i jast wanted say you're  a amazing yt and i love your youtube i hope i am nice fan
IHad to watch this cuz I love birds and I have two in real life!
✨🌸🍡🦋
🌸✨🦋
Ooooo
Lizzie is kind of a meme with how much she dies
1 HOUR AGO. 24k likes  LIZZIE YOUR SO CUTE!! YOU KEEP GETTING THE CUTEST ORIGINS!  (Edit I spoke to soon😂😂2:13)  (More edits YOUR HOME HAS SECTIONS OF YOUR OLD LIVES)
Bring blocks on your adventures so you can pillar up when attacked and have a stare-down
I have three things to say. 1: The mysterious decorations represent all Lizzie's past origins. 2: Lizzie could maybe team up with Lauren who ended her last episode saying she can still be a villain (Lauren thought she deserved the water prank, so Lizzie and Lauren are on more equal terms. Not fully equal but close). 3: Avoid angel Scott.
Your house is decorated with all your past lives ✨Master Detective✨
i love how she died in the first 2 mins
10:04...I apparently am a genius. Those decorations were based off of your previous origins.
I love how lizzie died instantly ✨
I think the decorations represent Lizzie s past orgins?
I know what it mean it represents all of your lives but I don't understand the cow one?
Hi I’m a big fan been watching for years
I know what the nooks are for. ;]
The decorations are her past lives! :O
Lizzie - IM A BIRD Me - No it said your a BIRB
OMGGGGGGGG WHAT IM IN LDSHADOWLADYS VIDEO?????? IM LITERALLY ALMOST CRYING RN
I honestly think Lizzie has a death curse  Edit:Also who else thinks the little nooks are her past lives?!?!
It was so funny to me how when she got attacked by the the boar she said: What the ffff- blazing.
Sinster lady
Nobody dies as lizzie 😌😂
:0
what the *curses*
Your a enderman kinda
U guys dont take this seriouse i getsuper mad bc u dont care ur just cool with it ( ◜_◝ )
If this keeps happening this serise is gonna be short lol
Img Lizzie lived longer than q ep as a origin get revenge Lizzie kill everybody who wronged u
The little nooks are displays of where she lived as other lives, or WHAT she lived as other lives. At least, that’s my guess!
Lol when Lizzie gets a new origin she dies after like 5 mins
I love her
don’t die again  please
Rip to the pansexual bird
I love birds... you dont know how much this hurts me
why was i kinda supprised to hear you **almost** swear
The quote-unquote Mysteries are representations of her past life's the one with the blue plant is representing her Floren past life
its all her past lifes
WOOOOW
I understand what the decorations mean it's all her past origins
I love when Lizzie dies she doesn’t get so sad but instead has such a positive energy when she has a new origin and they match her personality so well !!
Yes! Thank you so much I am sooooo happy
wow u rock lizzie!
LIZZIE. 😭
Only Lizzy would die in the first 5 minutes
good thing she didn't die at the end of the episode. I was VERY nervous and scared for the end part.
Just don't die quickly again. You just have 5 lives left lol
You can live with Shubble! :) SHE was a Birb. :D SHE will love it !
ahh the waterfall entrance reminds me of biscuit boys
Each corner is an origin
It seems like she will die twice every episode.
Lizzie its not a secret location when people can look at this video and see it on the mini map
Holes are Lizzie’s worst enemy
why has it taken so long to post a new video
Lizzie...you should rlly stop dieing
Is every little area your old origins?
The little boxes might be all here past after lives!!!
now don't follow a certain person  and fly into a tree.  yet  all birb players die in less than 1 episode and instead die  in 2 minutes .
i know your secret its your making all your old lives
Hi Lizzie I live in England and would love to meet you but my parents don’t let me
I told people she died twice
I love the parrots I owned 2 before
Stop dieing plzz
IS EVERY NOOK LIKE A PAST ORIGIN?  KHRJAJKVGHAHDJHS AHHH
what the fffffffff
All the decorations in her base is the past lives of her origins
so her new lair is decorated with elements of her past lives
Next episode, you should make a horror-themed escape room area (like Scott does on his channel sometimes, or I think you've made some on Joel's server) for the other player's to try to solve! It would fitting with your "mystery, puzzles, and trickery"
I thought after a long time one episode without death but then realized that you died in this video like 3 time kangaroo and birb
Ive figured out lizzes base layout
Lizzy always gets cute orígenes
ALL OF THE DECPRATIONS REPRESENT HER PREVIOUS ORIGINS.
10:58 what the fff- blazes is that
all of the little nooks are designed by her origins 😶
Wow I love your secret place it’s so cool
Scott has wings for the second time
I think the mystery of the things in her base are of her last lives. Flowers beehive: floran. amethyst and blue thing: Goolen. Rainbow wool : bird. Racoon home: racoon and more
Not Lizzie killing a pig with her powers and being chased by two other kinds of pigs later 🤣🤣 i believe that's called KARMA
Lizzie is kinda freakin me out rn… My birb started screaming when she killed the parrot Keep up the good work with the videos!!!
WHAT THE FFF..... BLAZES?
I just noticed if you press the thumbs up its festive!  tested the thumbs down after it to see if it did anything special or dramatic but its still the same  Than I did the thumbs up again
The mysterious wall just show all the lives you had before the enigma
The walls are for her past life in Minecraft like her plant wall she was a flooring
Getting kinda scared of Lizzie now
My theory: the nooks in lizzies' base are based off of her old origins. ex. Lizzie needed a parrot for her birb origin and the gooey blue slime blocks for her goolien origin.
I was waiting sooo long for this episode and honestly I cant stop watching it ❤️❤️
I feel like Lizzy goes even crazier after each death
:]
The who's in the wall represents your past lives
All your bases from before!? 9:58
i guess its hard to be a birb
8 episode  already lost 9 life's
Lizzie u should make a scary house
UwU
Ngl lizzy looked like a pan flamingo
Who else was waiting what felt like a year for their favourite series to get a new eppisode! :D Welcome back lizzie
UMMMMM Lizzieee,   ur secret base can be seen throguh the mapppp , oopssss
all the nooks and lizzies new home represent her old origins! I think that was a super cool idea. keep up the good work lizzie :)
I’m soooo happy you posted again I was waiting 4 ever flappy flappy birdie birdie
OMG STOP DIEING LIZZIE!
Lizzie you die to last you need to be more careful.
Please don't die☹ You are precious to me ❤
I feel so bad about her death
Omg she died so quickly I’m so sad 😞
LIZZIE WHY DO YOU KEEP DIEING
I love how she gets the cute Origins and dies quick but with the not cute ones she doesn’t.
Please don't die in the next episode
Wow good girl
She's gone insane again
you should join the villain team
I  AM A GENIUS  Ldshadowlady's origins:  1. racoon 2. end floran 3. ALEIN THING 4.kangooroo  5.parrot  6. then this
I'm placing this as a way for people to bet whether or not Lizzie lives this episode. Hopefully this gets pinned
I have a theory i think every “decoration” resembles one of the life’s she died as. For example, Parrot for le parrot, Boat for the death of barracuda,Bee hive and pumpkin well thats the end life,Crystal is the alien, Red shack is the raccoon , I’m assuming the books are for the betrayal or regular purposes
HOW MANY TIMES DO U DIE LIZZIE
The base has all her passed lives
Lizzy what is with the pink yellow and blue in that order
The nuks are for each being you’ve been in this Siris
I did NOT expect her to die three minutes into the video. That was a surprise o-o
How does Lizzie dies so quickly
Birb, shortest origin in history
It’s all of her origins
omg i love how you became a birb i love birbs!!!
I think the little rooms represent her past life’s that why they I themed so different!
All of the nock are all your previous life roles
I have figured out what the mystery rooms are they are supposed to be parts of her past Minecraft lives
you should play hide and seek in minecraft with your new origin
Please keep this
I like creepy Lizzy
She could fly for like 1minute
lol she was about to cuss LAMO
Lizzie's skin looks like the pan prideflag, and it's also extremely adorable-
You should go establish yourself in the league of villians. Scott just ate it so there might be a vacancy in the heirarchy.
I love this one, but I know it won’t last long Queen 😞
Ok on your mystery Basement Or House  One of those decorative is the symbol of all Your origins first is racoon second is flower girl second is alien third is parrot then next is mysterious origin or erigin is it?
The Unusual Decoration Things (idk what to call them) Resemble All Her Past Lives <3
1HOUR LATE
Dose anyone else realize that her base is at spawn she showed it
Yay first episode in a while that didn't end with death screen. I'll take that even though you die earlier 😅 And I love the creepy feels at the end, I'm so excited for the next episode.
Let’s hope she doesn’t die again lol ❤️🐦
10:56 what the f—— blazes is that LOL
The little parts in herb secret place is probably all her orgins she had but then died so I think they are based off her cute origin s
Lizzy is creepy and made it too obvious hat she made a remembrance for every life she had XD
i think it is pretty obvious of what she is doing with her house i found it out pretty fast
That was not a creepy ending at all!
It’s been so long
your out tro is creppy i like the vabs it fits to the origain
i know the mistery
DID LIZZY ALMOST SAY A CURSE
Are all the nooks based on your previous life? Love your videos.
I WANT MORE PLEASE LIZZY THESE VIDOES ARE THE BEST!!!!
I was waiting for so long!!
I know what all you decorations mean it’s of all of your past lives
im getting flashbacks from x life!
so were all ignoring The fact that she almost said the f word
I love your video but it takes to long for you to release it
“Oh no! My one weakness being weak!”-Lizzie
I figured out why she decorated the nooks like that. They represent her bases from her other origins.
I love how lizzie was excited to have wings for the fist time then died straight away 🤣😂
In ur base are all the mysterious nooks all the ppl u were like badger , alien , bird , fairy I think ,kangaroo I can’t remember if there’s more
She survived 2 min and 20 sec as a bird lol
I've been waiting the queen is finally back
I feel bad she keeps dieing
1 hour ewrlyyyy
she survived-ish for 1 episode!
You should join the villain club. The one Lauren was talking about when you died as a goolien.
I know your secret nooks >:) you can’t get anything passed me
this whole episode was me yelling "Lizzie run!!" every time you're near a mob in fear that you might die
Lizzie: *gets attacked by a boar* Also Lizzie: WHAT THE F- blazes is that
lizzie, I really love ur videos I’ve been a fan since 2015. I love this series sm and I please hope ur not burning ur lives. ur videos are so entertaining and fun to watch. ur such a talented youtuber and never fail to make ur videos in good quality.
Its her old origin
I know what the things you made in the wall are they represent all you orgins! Also I was afraid you would curse due to what happened in empires when you said the H word.
This is scary😍🎤
8 episodes already lost 5 lives
lizzie died Quite a lot but its entertaining
Every nook is one of Lizzies roles
I love how when she was building the enigma house she was collecting items from her past origin’s
OHHHHHHHHH       LLIIZZI
At 10:57 minutes in she tried so hard not to say a bad word…
"In a HOllEeeeee"
I love how Lizzie is always funny! I love you Lizzie so much! Im your biggest fan! Love you!💖💖💖
They are your other organs
Wow
10:58   Ldshadowlady/lizzie:what the f... Blazes is that
She is on her six life and on her eighth video
All her decorations are based on her origins the first was a racoon cows for some reason idk- but the second one is the floren with the flowers and pumpkin the third was the goolien with the spaceship things and then the parrot ✨   P.S. Lizzie I think you’ll die first-
Lizzie only died once in this episode things are looking up! Lol! 💕
All the nooks mean her origins!
I knew you were gonna die 😣😣
i really hope she doesn’t die this time 😭
"What the f- *realises this is a family friendly channel* -blazes is that?!"
the nooks are made for each origin lizzie had, flowers for floran, the red house rood for racoon, the parrot and colors for birb, and the slime and copper for goolien, and cow and boat being how she was a kangaroo
I think you punch things and that hurts them just  not with tools
10:58 is it me or did lizzie just almost say the f word-
That birb death was rough.
I love your video 😃
All your nooks are your lives
We will never be able to solve them  there based on all your different bases
finally a episode where she doesn't die💀😅
I wonder what the nooks could be...               (Maybe Past Origins 👀 But You Didnt Hear It From Me Okay)
I love how you've died so many times and it's really funny! Love u Lizzie!🫶😭🥹
I'm going to miss the birb... 0:00 - 2:17 😔
I understand the nooks in her place it is to represent her/his  old origins
OMG WHY HAS THIS MINECRAFT WORLD HATE YOU. YOU ARE DIE IN ALL MOST ALL OF THE VIDEOS.
The mystery the mystery!!
I WAITED SOO LONG FOR THIS
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lizzie omg ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The decorations are evrywhere she has built a home
past life nuke
Its betting time, who wants to bet lizze's series will be the first to end?
A literally squeal whenever an afterlife SMP member posts
Somehow I knew that Lizzie would die from the many times it already happened.
Imagine how many people you can spy on! Just spawn a clone in your secret base and sneak into people’s homes without them knowing.
Why is it when Lizzie gets evil origins she makes such cute and cool bases
How long do you think until gachatube picks up on this?
Also the nooks (I think) represent your past origins. It would mean life if you hearted this!
Lizzie I have an idea what if you can go to the enemies house like let’s say Lauren I would love to see you go there please get revenge on her I would love to see it
Bird Look Like A Pan Flag But Different
Poor Lizzie 😂
Lizzie: I’m a mystery Me (an intellectual): it’s not a mystery. You’re going to die again.
I loved u being a bird but then u died rip lizzie
I’m so sad the bird didn’t last 🦜 I really wanted to see her ride someone 😭🤪🤩
Maybe using a lava bucket or a bow/crossbow might deal damage considering their a projectile
I love the enigma origin! It's very mystical and cool. Love you Lizzie!<3
omg lizzie stop dying
Omg Lizzie why, and also I know what the mysterious rooms are, there all your different lives
how many lives you have left lizzie? i lost count.
I know the secret your trying to build your origins !! Right!!!
I’m assuming that the nooks are all of Lizzie’s old origins!
Me waiting 2 weeks waiting for a new video and you died in like 5 seconds
The Enigma origin reminds of Fluttershy
its a pansexual flag birb
I know why you have these decorations
I was going to say she should join Scott but then I remembered he’s not a villain anymore and is now the complete other end of the spectrum. So… Lizzie, word of advice. Stay away from Scott. (Unless you can trick him into having a starring contest with you XD)
Istg Lizzie if you die one more time….
What an enigma !!! It is a quiet a puzzle, that hideout's art. One room representing "Gardens of the End"; another "The Mysterious Space"; some "Garbage" may become art; "Cows and Boats" for any reason; and a "Shrine for Birds". Who can solve this ? WHO !!! Only someone who embraces all the capabilities of their origin can.
What life are we on now?
Her little rooms are her past life’s if you didn’t notice that’s why she needed a bird
You finally posted
Join the villain team
I think you spawned in the desert because you were a kangaroo and respawned before your origin changed.
If you wanna know why Lizzie has all those nooks in her house, here's a hint: Her origins.
All of the Knox. Are from you are old origin
I think she tries to die at this point. 😑
I know what you are doing you are doing that it goes with all your powers
"my one weakness, being weak!" LMAOOOOO, I'm gonna use that soon. 😂 Also, I'm pretty sure Lizzie's up to 5 lives, hopefully her life as an Enigma will last longer.
the decorations is all the origins she’s been!  anyone else catch on real fast?
OH MY GOD!! THAT SKIN IS SO COOL!!! all your origins are absolutely adorable! <3333
I can’t believe she already died in the first 2 mins😧
Good you survived
I  just realized how tiny she was😂 but the outfit is cute
Do you still have pink hair
I’ve figured out what all the nooks are. Very clever Lizzie.😁
She... She didn't die?? How, this is impossible the cycle the origins is she not destined to die what is happening??
*points* Axes and swords are good…. *open hand* but TNT is better.
Yes only one hour late!:)
I love how each nook is a symbol of her past lives 😂😂
I’m pretty sure you can faze through walls as an enigma
did ldshadowlady almost say the FWORD  10:58
I’m scared of you now
Hi
I Already know what the room is it's all the things you've been 🤣
I saw this at 1 hour
Ok, so I was half right, I predicted birb and phantom, because of that clip from sausages video
In other episode you can be panda🐼
lizzie been throwing these episodes lately
Don’t die dont die
Hi
Im not the only one who came here one hour after
All of your corners are to do with your past origins except for the library which is for humi and his friends Rainbow with bird head: birb Red with trash: raccoon Library: humi  Goo blocks with amethyst: goolien Bunch of random plant blocks: Florian Cow heads and boat: Kangaroo Special notes: raccoon one has your old red house and humi is in the old red house, On kangaroo you have a cow heads which is what you put in a castle to annoy people and the boat is the entity you died inside of
The decorations are your past origins right?
10:57 LOL-
Bro u forgot the map 💀
Waited so long oh my gosh it is finally out yasssss
I think everything on the wall is about what power she had in the past a bird raccoon it all makes sense now❤️
Please put the mods
WHY
Blimey next thing you know shes gonna be a dinosaur!
The last part gave me chills
You coulda used a lead and trapped it in a cage course you'd have to nametag it plus getting it home woulda been challenging
blkjn sis namoca
Lizzie miss her ild origin sooo she make a rwmembrance
you were about to say what the f::k
Those spots with all those items are all your life that you have died in
WOOO YESH don’t die this is actually VERY COOL
You dette dig destime godt job🥳
I know that the secret of her interior is her privious homes.
How do you get these mods?! They are adorable! I wanna try them!
Those mysterious decorations were her past life's
That's all your origins so simple it ain't a secret anymore
Wow I think this is the first episode in a while that didn’t end in death! I’ve come to tense up whenever her videos draw to a close but this time I was pleasantly surprised!
I believe that the so called headquarters represent each of your previous origins, so cool!
I just hope next episode is going to be the End of the Enigma Origin tho. Love you Lizzie!!
I KNOW its you origens 😌
Omg it’s so cute
"Lizzie got birb? That's not gonna last long..........oh. Well, yeah, there you go."
All the nooks are origins she’s been!
She is decorating like her lasts life.racoon florian goolien bird kangaroo
Honestly how many lives does lizzy only have?? I love this series and I'm worried that this might end for her already😭
The nooks you made in your base is themed from all of the animals you have been.
The "decorations" are al the other uh powers she had
10:15  are these her past lifes?
Lizzie I saw how you decorated you made each part of where you decorated match your lives before you sadly died
did anyone else see when it said you are now a birb in chat at  0:15
You keep dying!
All the walls with the design is all the lives she had the racoon the alien the end plant thingy I forgot and the uhhhhhhhhhh I forgot the another one again
There’s a mini map .
Lizzie you should make your headquarters area into a maze so that you can stare down any intruders and they have no way to esacpe while you can easily phase through all the obstacles
do u die on purpose
I was so excited for the flying bird omg lmao🤭🙈💖
The mistery continues to see if she will continuasly die every up coming episode
The nooks are all your fallen orgins
Hi I love youre videos! ❤️
The nooks are your a representation of your previous lives, also I’m loving the vib and your new origins are really cool
Keep your eyes on the prize until the prize dies lmao 🤣🤣
You go girl 😎😎😎😎
I wonder how an encounter with Scott would go since he is now a Vengeful(Holy) angel. As he called himself.
The amount of effort you put into these videos is insane, Lizzie!
Archived footage of lizzie going insane due to not being able to keep an origin for more than an episode
im only 1 hour late!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Okay but like, I can’t get over just how adorable that skin is and how well it matches her voice oml I love it  Edit: she just died... Immediately 😃
Thank God You didn't die this time as an Enigma Lizzie!
YOU STAYED ALIVE! ISH!
I know the mystry! It's all her past lives. The trash for the raccoon,  pumpkin and flowers for end floraln,  amethysts and goo for a goolian, books for kangaroo and a bird for a bird!
Girl we all know that thise nooks are memorials for your past lives
Good luck
It is all of the orgins!
Me being surprised u didnt die as a enigma   But I loved your powers and skins along the way💜
lets be honest here , lizzie's the best at being either a sweet cutesy character or an evil out for trouble one. Im gonna say evil lizzie is my favourite, She does it well!
Yay she finally survie si hope this origin lasts longer
LIZZIE U LOOK SO CUTE AAA
Lizzy recreated all of her origins in the base
I knew Lizzie was a birb from the parrot skin, BUT I HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS A enigma. I thought she was a thornling xD
Ohhhhhh these mean all the times she has died
Oh ffff blazes yeah yeah
I have figured out the docor on the walls they are her past live the sticks and composter is her raccoon life. The pumpkin and honey is the floran life.nether amethyst is her alien spaceship,the parrot head is here bird life, and the cow heads and boats were pranks from here kangaroo life. Like if you agree.
LIZZIE STOP DYING
Well one time
I know the mistier-us decorations (it’s the many times she has died and all her lives)
2 minutes in and she dies!
i am makeing a death bord you are winning
nooooooooo it  ended so fast please post again soon😅
She died 2 times in one video
They represent her past iragind
I know your it’s decorations, it’s your lives
Lizzy your gonna lose all your lives
FOR A SECOND THERE I THOUGHT THIS EPISODE WILL ONLY LAST 2 MINS😂😆 Gosh, I was panicking every time she is about to die!!😖😫 Btw congrats on having an ep without you dying!! I will just ignore the fact that you literally died as a Birb...😄 I hope your origin lasts longer 🦝🐝👽🦘🦜❔(srry i just love emojis)
I love you so much and to see you'd videos I my subscription list makes me soo happy ❤❤❤❤❤
The egnima  description sounds scary and evil WIAT that means she gonna turn into a villian Lel her personality kinda doesn’t fit it but that just makes it more interesting
" What the f-.... blazes is that? " Nice save
Praying that lizzie doesn't die again in the next episode- 😅
All of the places in the house is for all her lives
lizzie is speedrunning afterlife😪😪
I LOVE U LIZZIE 💓
You have NO IDEA how desperate i have been for thissss
Lazy was about to say the f word
The rumors mean what animals she’s been
omg yay
:0
First, not again. Last, those rooms seem... familiar.
Lizzy i think birb may have been the second most saddest death lets all have a moment of silence for birb
At11:3 she almost said the f
if you wont come with me wilingly then i will bring yo with me in a body bag
All nook’s are Showing all of Lizzie’s life’s
YOUR ORIGIN IS SOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOLLLL ohhh is the little nook things for the origins you had
I am LOVING this new origin
I bet those decoration are her represent her past origins
If anyone is wondering the decorations Lizzie build was her past origins
"OH NO! MY ONLY WEAKNESS! BEING WEAK!" "Here are the last words of Ldshadowlady enigma form."
It is all of her past lives
I miss floran lizzie
Finally! An episode  where lizzie doesn't die! I hope this life stays longer than 3 episodes
Ldshodawlady pls make a super cute world in Minecraft without mods pls I need it
So is Lizzie a Villain as an enigma?
I love how Lizzie said blah blah blah at the important stuff
I think that the role that she had is kinda a virus a deadly virus but Idk it's just me but I love her new role !
Early! 💗
Omg MAKe more videos
the 2 week wait was definitely worth it. I love how lizzy try's her best all the time.
I’d just like to say thank you because I have been watching you since I was 5
WHAT THE FF— BLAZES?
I was notified of this 6 minutes ago why is there comments from an hour ago? Anyway, anyone keeping track of lizzies numbers? I think shes at 6 Edit: spelled her name wrong, that is the change
So cool and emigas are cool You could get revenge by these emiga powers😊
She almost said the f word-
The decor in the house is a representation of her past lives.
If I am guessing please let me know if I am right please shout me out if I'm right
I think the decorations are here past lives
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU DIED???!!?!
I figured out ur mystery decorations in the base :) love your content lizzie, keep up the good work
Those little nooks are her past origins 😁
I like how you spawned in the desert where you were trying get there last time
Lizzie was about to cuss right here 🤭 10:55
all her lives
The funny thing is that she got me two origins in the same video and when she turned into a birb she didn’t even get a house
No way she died so quickly
10:00 me figuring this out: 😙✌ my head: HECK YEAH
a bird its soo cute i lover orgin i love birds soooo cute then die and love 2nd orgin
Each nook is for a life you have lived
"WHAT THE F-  *PANIC* BLAZES IS THAT !???"
6 deaths 4 more
She should team up with Scott
Ik what her decorations are now! It is:her past origins!
U keep on dying i really love your goolien area but u died 😫😫😫
The last 20 secs were horrifying to be honest
I love how lizzie was a cute bird in the beginning, but then she dies and turns into a evil enigma XD
She should be one of the villains she would fit perfectly with the rest of them
guys I think her decorations are based off of her old lives
Hi
WOOOOOOW! I HAVE BEEN WAITING! THANK THE HEAVENS FOR THE VIDEO
LDShadowLady I think I know what you did you made each area based off of your other lives you have the raccoon the alien the parrot so yeah that's what I think
The decor around your secret base corresponds to your previous lives!!! Ha! I'm a genius 😌
Lizzy you should make a treehouse 💕🥰
This is such a cool origin! I meant that for both! Sad the birb is short-lived tho. I wish you could try out the clone feature! I feel like the invisibility it gives you will make mobs forget you a bit so you can safely run away. Can't wait for your villain arc, your powers seem very very good for heinous deeds *insert maniacal laughter* wink wink nudge nudge.
YOUR AT 5
WoW
I have now know
Hi!!!!
ONE OF THE FIRST EP WHERE LIZZIE DIDNT DIE
HEY AHHH HI is it just me or did I say that
Uh lizzy the mini map was still up when you were at that place
Hi girl! I just started watching you, and I only now expect the best, which I know you can complete, love you bestie!
Make a shark tank to scared  people
Everydecoration Is Lizzies Origin >×<
The knoks are your old origins!!!
Omg hi lizzie im a huge fan cant belive u died and im not even half way through the video !😂Love ya great work!
Birb
Our new villain POG! Now that Scott's gone we have a new villain.
I dont think you realizes but youve got the pan colours on your wall where the head is
V
Did anyone else think Lizzie's skin looks like the pan-sexual flag? I just see a Pan Birb
Lizzie you died 5 x 😅
This made my day
I finally found out what the places are for.I think it's for all her lifes
Ok tell me where do you get all these mods tell mee
All that decorations is her origins 💅
YAYHHH A NEW VIDEOH
Gods yes Lizzy become the supreme villain of the server 😍
And a very cool base idea would be a base made of glass you should definitely try it out!
Love the new origin!
YASS YOU UPLOADED!!! I thought you were ded
*you would have to be a genius to solve this*     Me: oh! Your past origins! Great idea lizzie keep being you!! ❤
WHAT THE F- BLAZE’S IS THAT
Finally you lasted an episode!
Lizzie why I love the bird 😭😭🥺
8:41 I think the minecraft community would disagree
It's morning there
Finally an origin of not dying in your first origin and I rlly hope you don’t end the series to early because I had fun
Omg I love you videos so much
I get it now... the red and trash for the racoon the end stuff for the ender thing (I forget ok-) the lighting rod for the alien and the rest idk-
one hour💀
FINALLY LIZZIE I WAS WAITING SOO LONG CANT WAIT TO WATCHHHH
Lizzie you can destroy the world!
Im starting a petition to get Lizzy infinite lives because she is CLEARLY cursed
Me starting the video: 5 dollars she dies before the video is over Edit: I am 2 minutes in the video and she has died 😏 where's my 5 bucks, I shall keep watching  (this is just a joke please don't come at me)
9:54 ..o ma god i understand it Its your past lifes (╬ Ò • Ó) houses,biomes,bases!
I know what you did so it means I am a Genius
I do not like it when you die but I think your new life is awesome I liked the bird and the Enigma. I love your new lives. But you only have 5 more lives left, sadly.
Love your videos!! ❤️❤️❤️😋
Lizzie you really need to be more careful! LOL
Am I the only one who realised the tiny nooks represent her old origins?
At this point Lizzie is gonna have explored every origin on this mod within no time hehe
Omg!!!!
I know your secrets but I will not reveal them
I adore this. No mega spoiler on your origin. 10/10 hope this origin lasts but. It is a very hard one to keep alive it seems 0.0
Yay a new video :)
I know it’s all your lives and stuff you’ve been
Lizzie 4 more your prob gonna get banned!!!! It’s beauty btw the video is beauty
You die in every episode
" Oh my one weakness being weak "
“My one weakness, being weak!” -Lizzie 2022
I love the skin sm😭😭
I can’t be the only one that is super happy that she didn’t die…well she did but you know what I mean
It's sad cuz Lizzie will probably be the first one out of the series since she's already so low on lives
it's all the orgin she had
I BEEN SEARCHING THIS FOR LITERRALY FOR 1491 YEARS
Bro the birb lasted 2 minutes 30 seconds
I figured out what the mysterious decorations in lizzes base mean.. If you can't tell, its all of her old origins! I could tell by the blocks and deco.
The areas are your old 𝗢𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗼𝗻𝘀
That little “rooms” she made are all the different things she has been..
I know the mystery place it's know by one of lizzies lifes
fun fact if you stare at an enderman and keep staring at it it will freeze as long as you dont look away.
I love how she made all of the little nooks in her home look like her houses from past lives (for those who didn't see it)
Ldshadowlady almost sweared in this video Lol
Aww the little nooks are to represent her past origins
As soon as I saw the little nooks had a certain theme I knew it was her past lives.
Are you a villain now
Omg i have been waiting for this eo lol In my time this came out at 9pm lol
lizzie in the first minutes: 💓💗💖💘🦆🐤🐦  lizzie after the few minutez: ‼️‼️🚩🚷💀💀
Lizzie honestly you have a beautiful name you're funny too😉
All the nooks in your house are your old life sucks right
The rooms are Lizzie's past life's
Pansexual parrot 🦜
oh my lord when are u gonna stop dying xD
I think the nooks Lizzie is building is to represent all her origins
I love how you are a cute friendly parrot and then a mysterious mystery sinister enigma. But atleast you are continuing your trend of during every episode 👏👏👏👏 love your content 🥰
You posted another video 😁
It’s cool
Never let them know your next move..
Guess the poppa bird pushed you out the window and you didn't learn to fly. And part of me was expecting you to make it Green because of Enigma from Batman
the fact you die in every episode is funny and not funny
The room had all of lizzys past lives hidden inside of her base
Episode 9
lLY 🤗
I like the enigma but was really hoping she could keep the birb but then she died in a hole lol
9:00 oh no, my one weakness... being weak!!
I know almost everyone knows but...Those 'decorations' on her wall represents her previous lives
The design on the sides is all her life so far
2.34 minutes in you die 😑 honestly I'm not surprised anymore you die in every video but your still one of my favourite YouTubers
Wow omg your skin is so cool i really love itʕ´• ᴥ•̥`ʔ◉‿◉🤗😺
I am actually dying by the fact till 8th episode , she has died 5 times!  Bird origin is really cool though.....
Finally! An episode where Lizzie doesn't die at the end! Well, she did die at the start but that's a different story!
i’ve been waiting for a new episode finallyyyy
Well at least Lizzie survived!😄
I figured out that all of the rooms represent her origins
I LOVE YOU LDSHADOWLADY IVE BEEN WATCHING UR CHANNEL FOR 5 YEARS AND ONCE I SAW THIS NEW VID I CLICKED ON IT BEFORE READING THE TITLE 💗💗💗💗💗
Secret base? We can still see the mini m😳
I need more of this series
The rooms are your old lives. Im so smart
Girl you are dieing a lot
"bro i heard that enigma cheated on her boyfriend" "bro whos enigma?" "......" "bro?" "whos enigma?" "........" "ENIGMA DEEZ NUT FOT IN YOUR MOUT-"
are the nooks based off the past life’s?
it’s offical. enigma lizzie has lost it.
The mystery books are let lives she died as
Lizzie:gets cute origin Also Lizzie: dies Lizzie: doesn’t get a cute origin for once Also Lizzie: Doesn’t die Is this a sign that the server wants her to be a villain?
Omg hiiii
Wait why do you need that
Yes! I was so exited when she posted again
omg- It's been SO LONG!! but I heard that theres gonna be empires Series 2 MY FREIND IN SCHOOL TOLD ME!! I'm exited to see Series 2!!
Your base has all yourr past orgine its not a mistry anemore
oo noice decorations -definately not her old lives or anything-
cool
I just clicked this video and I know she died again  she did
poor lizzie is so accident prone 😂
all the rooms she built were to represent all her lives, for example the one with the boat represents the kangaroo because she died on a boat as a kangaroo
I think the nooks are your previous origins and the boat in the cow area signalling your death to barracuda
Omg lizzie those are decoratoin of you past life i get it thats why you need a bird doy
Omg the nooks are all of her past lives!
In my years of watching and playing Minecraft I’ve never see someone so good at dying everytime 😂 😂
BIRD LIZZIE BIRD LIZZIE BIRD LIZZIE
Your base is the waterfall near spawn you reavelewd it when getting a parrot !   And at 10:04 I GOT IT the amethyst Represents her goolien orgin the one with the beehive represents her floran orgin the one with the red wallpaper represents her raccoon orgin the color full one represents her birb orgin the cows represents her kangaroo orgin with the prank on CPK And the boat for the prank on Scott!!
Join the The Villains
Lizzie make gooooood base that can't kill u ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Hopefully this origin lasts a lil longer than the others!
*cries* each nook is one of your lives *CRYING INTENSIFIES*
I think the nooks are supposed to be all the origins she had
I think I know what the “decorations” mean
Ohhhh if shubble didn’t die noooooo
eek so exciting to watch
10:56 I've been watching Lizzie for 6 years and I don't think I've ever heard her nearly slip out a swear word lol!
i love it i always watch ur video when its night or day it just maked me happy all the time 🥰
You should make a house  that looks haunted and start a club for ghosts!
OMG why do you guys always have to make theEnd so dramatic
:)
WTF 😢
Lizzie has 4 lives left. How did this happen so quickly??😭😭
i really thought she was going to die twice in one episode
I would have Lizzie as a pet :D
I think the little ‘confusing’ things in her house are supposed to represent her past lives
Hey Lizzie I knew the secrets instantly they are all your past lives
I'm late 😓😭
Omg i was waiting for this to happen!
y
I was so excited for the birb it was so cute 😭
mystr
SHE FINALY POSTED
I have solved the mystery those areas show your past origins
I Love how Lizzie relly takes her roles as different Origin each episode and how mucht efort and time  she puts in to every video i relly Love it Keep it up
I love the totally secret base design that definitley isn't her previous origins...
I think I understand the base That item frame with the spruce sapling in might represent the Raccoon origin and that purple and blue slime thing is like your goolien base. The bird is self-explanitory but im not sure about the lecturn or the cows and boats....  LOVE the video btw
That’s sad you died sooo fast
Lizzie, I think it's time you brought the villains on the server back together. Starting with Scott (who is now an angel somehow)
A bird and then an enigma  The bird skin is so cute and Love your videos ❤💖
lizzie: u wont understand these rooms me: i alredy know lizzie its too easy  also me: saying the answers also also me: why is it so easy lol ..... if you dont know what it means  it is her old origins  red thing with roof = racoon the honey comb = floran the trash u should know  there ya go!
She had a fast end to the birb like Shubble.
The weird is for the origin that you have lived
I love how she added refferences to all her past lives in her new home
The rooms are inspired by your old orgins?
Not a gen oof
I like how she made little parts in her base her other origins.
Lizz8e your on 6our 7th life
Omg! Lizzie actually survive 1 episode :0
finaly!!!! a new vidio!!!
The house is based on her past lives,  it's always going to remain with her
Okay but the ending where she was like "you thought you could escape me...but you were wrooong~ -places head- its....perfect : )"   That shit was scary. Do more of that
Its a plane no its a salad no its birb
Can you make it so every time you die you take a flower or anything that is related to your past life's and name 8t something
love to watch anew ep and apprecite the work
She is making every single origin she has in after life
(I'm a new subscriber)
Lizzy the deaths🤣 well we still love you! ♥️
she's losing all her lives
How many more live does she have
Best ep till date 🥰
This was a good episode well all of yours are but u no prob my fave one yet idk and I love how u talk in a evil voice and then your outro comes on lol
The awkward silence while waiting for the pig to die was loud 😭😭
I'm l big fan of your videos
Lizzie: *becomes a Bird* Also Lizzie: *dies immediately and then decapitates a birds head*
But she Recarnad in into a ranigma
did not expect that
Hi I have hated you since forever and love your content
Very secret when you have a mini map in the upper left corner of youre screen showing exactly where you are :D
First of all just got to say, LIZZIE STOP DYING! 🤣😂  Also this new origin is so cool, I hope that Enigma Lizzie will stay alive for a bit I can't wait for the next episode, and I hope that you're doing well and staying safe and healthy Lizzie!
All the nooks are based of your past lives lol.❤😂
NEW RECORD good job :)
In order to have animals do leads work?
And I love how u did all your other origins!
Lizzie:the hint is that to enter u have to pass a waterfall  At the end: gets of a waterfall   Me:well now its not secret
Okay okay so she was first a raccoon, then a Florian, then a gooliean, then a kangaroo, a bird, and now an enigma! Did I get al her origins? If so she has like 4 lives left 🥲
Oooouuuuu spooky.Keep up the hard work Lizzie!
LIZZIE PLEASE DONT DIE IN THE NEXT EPISODE I LOVE UR NEW ORGIN
7:27   ..SO NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT LIZZIE'S LEFT SOCK LOOK LIKE THE PANSEXUAL FLAG??    WELL NOW THERE IS
I didn’t really like her enigma skin but I loved the powers I like her birb skin

LDShadowLady LDShadowLady LDShadowLady           did it work? (People get pinned if u do that)
Lizzie is like the queen of dying 😂

Let’s hope the enigma lasts longer than an episode unlike her other origins 🥲🤩😆
She's gonna be the first one out lol
The little nooks are the origins she had
And you are so cool as an Enigma!!
Beautiful and outstanding!

Why are you dying so fast like do you not like this series??
LIZZE!!!!! IVE BEEN WATING FOR TWO WEEKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You know it said birb not bird
Omg loved this!
Does anyone think that’s Lizzie is gonna die a lot!
I love how you made decorations for every origin you've had, it's really creative and it turned out great!❤️❤️
Keep up the great work!! love your vids!!😍😍
Hopefully Lizzie joins Lauren as the bad guy league
Even though Lizzie has short lives, she always takes advantage of her abilities. Excited to see what you do next as an Eigma in your next episode!
o i know (the decoration) its every orgin u had
HI I GOT HERE AN HOUR AFTER THIS WAS POSTED BUT OMG YOU LOOK SO CUTE AS A BIRD OMG OMG
Villain arc? Perhaps.....
I cracked the case! The decorated spots in Lizze’s base is all her past lives, but I don’t know why she’s doing that....? 🤯 Someone any ideas? 🤩☺️🤪🤩
Enigma wow super cool lizzie !!!dont die lol anyways love from Nayarit Mexico 🇲🇽❤️❤️
You have not made an episode in a few weeks this video must have taken a lot of time
Cover the miny map !!!
LIZZIE YOU NEED TO HIDE YOURSELF FROM THE WORLD YOU KEEP ON DYEING😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Did anyone notice that Lizzies one sock looks like the Pan flag?
Im not 100% sure but I think Ll the little nooks and crannys in your new base is what you where before in you lats life
The small rooms present your past life’s. And if I’m right 3 more life’s Liz. Careful.
I didn’t understand but now I did it’s all your old life’s!
I feel like lizzie is gonna be the first to leave afterlife smp...
55 min late to a ld vid 😌
1 hour ago
Lizzies Secret nooks are all of her origins :)
I love how that other people in origins take a long time but lizzie dies every other day hope you live longer with an origin
I think she should join the villains group
the decorations r obviously all her lives
Lizzie: WHAT THE F- bLazEs iS tHat!
to anyone who's confused about THE ENIGMA'S house, she's collecting treasures that symbolize all her previous origins
I know what you're building meant it shows a bit of every single life you had
Okay bet.Lizzie's gonna be the first one out of the Afterlife smp
yes!!!!!!!! you need to do something with lauren
Is all her little places themed of all her different lives that she died? Because if you see she had the parrot origin but soon turned into the enigma when she was a enigma she build different little places of all her past origins like the raccoon you can see the red walls I think? That look like her past house the parrot has all the same colors as her skin I think she will expand it more for her other new origins! And great vid btw I love it! Keep up the good work!
Enigmas are soo cool they’re my fav origins lol
I've been waiting for ur next video I love ur videos♥️
you should join scotts villain club
The small rooms are your characters like bird 🦜room and like flower one and i am big fan i love all your videos bye we love you 💜💜.
I love how at 8 minutes their were already 18k views Lizzie’s awesome
Why did it take me so long to realize each nook was based on a past orgin lizzie had
the decoration is for each of your origins
I dont need to be a genius to know that the designs in your wall are just your past lives
finaly u and lauren finaly posted a afterlife vid
It’s like if the weird core aesthetic was a person in Minecraft
Lol lizzie,that you die in the beginning just like joel
THE WALL MISTERY IS ALL THE THINGS SHE HAS BEEN BEFORE BEING WHAT SHE IS NOW!
We all love you❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
58 minutes ago!! Helo!!!
I saw mythical sausage youtube video and he kinda spoiled it, you were invisible
She’s trying to decorate her place with the things that her other life needed to live bird the flooring is the flower place and the composter was your first life what is the Raccoon
Lizzy be careful you only have 6 lives left!!
You could make a room that is a Rubik s cube
Ommggg !! A bird so adorable Lizzie I absolutely love your new skin so cute make more vids please 😍🥰
'What the f- blazes is that' Why does this sentence makes me laugh
10:35 it's obvious each if those represents a previous origin
Make some sort of riddle room where players have to solve riddles while you stare at them, they die if they don't solve riddles fast enough
how come its like lizzie keeps getting bullied by all the other origins
Dang it Liz cannot live a freaking day without dying in the afterlife smp
For your decorations in your new hous are they themed on your past lives
Your nook represent all the life that you had
OH I GET IT THE DESIGHES IS REPERSENTTING (spelt wrong)HER LIVES
Lizzie you are not lucky
Lizzie dies every episode it’s not even surprising anymore LMAO
IM PRETTY EARLY YAY
She’s crazy
Waystone: Joel = Hot & Big  I was not expecting that, lol  timestamp 10:31
Lizzie, don't forget you can phase through things! I kept shouting at the screen when you were being chased by mobs
The League of Villains might get a new member...         (and inevitably loose it)
she started off as a cute little bird, then became an enigma then she killed a different bird
I knew it
aperently I'm a problem solving genius, each nook is based off of one of her past origins. 😂
the nooks in the walls are her past origins i think?
Lizzie we saw were you live.
❤️ ❤️ ♥️
I saw this 8 minutes ago Your new origin is VERY cool!
Listen you should join the villain thing this origin fits perfectly
Beautiful
And Lizzie died again
I’m so happy she posted both origins! Haha, she dies so fast great video lizzie! There hasn’t been one origin she hasn’t liked yet
Are you kidding me she didn’t even get to sit on someone
I thought you quit you took so long but glad your back
I LOVE THIIS lol
PLS LIZZY I BEG DON'T DIE AGAIN 😭😭 Edit: Nvm she died :(
"my only weakness is being weak!"
Only me who noticed that the colours of her bird skin is pan colours?? 💖💛💙
How many more episodes do you guys think are left? Lizzie’s dying quite quickly
10:08 past lives
Omg
Please don't die again Lizzie 😭😭
I know the decorations YOUR LIFES
Please don't die again Lizzie 😭😭
Yassss villain Lizzie finally
She is designing her base in all her past lives
It's all your orgens
Lizzie in the first 3 episodes: “I’m alive!” Lizzie most of the other episodes: “Why do I keep dying!?”
me at the start of the video : lemme guess, ur gonna die again
Hi
Her base is all her origins in a room I think?
You built yourself your own graveyard somehow. I can tell it...
Lizzie I don't mean this as hate or anything hurtful but it may come out of that how did you manage to survive X life?
58 minutes ago I’m so early
I feel like since the floral origin, Lizzie just immediately dies and in a way doesn't care about it ... Idk if she is just speedrunning this series or something, but I wish she would do more stuff like the rest of the After Life crew.
A Bird? Man, I was expecting a axolotl (P.S. Pin This Pls)
I was cry when I saw you die but you new thing is so cool 🥹😱🤗
Nice! 56mins ago
IM DEAD 10:57
hi i love your videos and you look so pretty as a bird!
Eek early I love ur vidss
The Base is all of her origins!
Shoutout (also pin or like)       Lizzie you always make my day shine i love all ur series You are literally my childhood i watch you since 2014. You are family Friendly and my favourite series are Empires and Kingdom craft also i wish you do another empires also i ALSO love this series where you become creatures also my fav one is raccoon cause it suits you!  Also If its only me, I felt so bad for that precious bird death :[   *You are PERFECTION in YOUTUBE*
All of the nooks and crannies are for all of her past lives
I don't know how you always find the motivation to make such a cute little base for every life! You've made like 4 😭😭😭 I could NEVER
I HATE THESE SPOILERS THAT POP ON YOUTUBE ABOUT YOUR NEXT REGION but yes you are very smoll as a birb
The mysterious things were representing her death
this new origin suits lizzie a lot!
your craycray...craycray
I feel like she’s making the nooks her past origins 😃
Early
Haven't watched the whole video yet,I'm guessing she died at the end again....
I’m really loving this series can you post more please?
um the colours
I know you are making some sort of shrine of all the thing you have been
I just realize the "decorations" are related to lizzies previous lives!!
It’s your past lives Lizzy -_- we all know
How have I figured out your secrets first storage now base parts?
I think ik what the nooks or they are her favorite past lives
finally an origen where she might no die
VILLAN ARC LIZZIE
YEYY!!!!
yoooo I like how enigma Lizzie put all of her old builds/ origins into her new base, it  took me a good second to realise what she was doing
57 minutes early! :D
The little areas are your origins
i saw a bright future for bird lizzie and the pink jungle  but then she died 😭
Why haven’t you posted in a long time
Now don’t die on that one!
an enigma??? omg so cool. R.I.P the survial players who died trying eye stare with enderman
why does it look like Pansexual flag
Ws all just watched lizzie slowly lose her sanity.
Lizzie has posted my day is made
I have a question who doesn’t like ldshadowlady she’s the most pure nice and funny person ever she has so much talent and personality it’s amazing 💗💖💞
I didnt expect you to post at 7am my time but im very excited to watch yhis
Stop doing challenges
I love your videos this is the earliest I have watched one of your videos I have watched every single one of your videos.  Your a amazing YouTuber please keep posting videos you make my day
The 5 seconds as a bird was cool
Omg I can’t wait to see more of your villain arc unfolding
The decorations In your house Or all your past Like past Powers yeah I saw amethyst That's How I
You spawnd there because from the kangaroo you spawend in deserts
The decorations are based on her previous lives I think
I love how she just freaking died in the 1st 2 minutes-
She’s gonna be the first one out of the series 💀💀💀
Early!
I understand the mysterious decorations! They are all meant to resemble Lizzie's past origins! The bird, the cow heads and the boats were a nod to the kangaroo pranks that she pulled such as filling up cpk's house with cows and bombarding Scott with boats, they were flowers and honey comb block things with a trap door that resembles something of the end so that must have been for the end floran, there was also some goo on the floor from her time as a goolien, and finnaly, she had a room that was the same color as her racoon house and it also had trees and a composter which could be interpreted as how she always replanted her trees and also the composter might also be a replacement trash can
Dancing parrot (LITERALLY IN MINECRAFT)! 🦜
10:58 “WHAT THE F- BLAZES IS THAT?!” Lizzie almost cursed! 😂
Those parrots are about to be Lizzies villain origin story
Lizzie could totally go after Scott with her death stare power
Nah you’re not a enigma you’re a uchiha
EEEEE
Lizzie gets all of the nice and cute ones then dies but when she gets one where it’s a littler more insane she survivesy
Finally new episode of afterlife!!!!!!!!!!!
Is it just me or I have anxiety that there's a possibility Lizzie will die this episode. 😃
OMG Gurl the fact you get the best luck by geting the best and the cutest life. u r so good. i love your videos
The enigma origin is my favorite! My only request for you: StOp DyInG!
Yay a new LDshadowlady video, I love your content and can't wait for when you post❤
My sister is a literally genius: in 0.5 seconds she figured out the enigma base has decorations from her past origins!
lizzie this may be the most creepy vid from u
The afterlife: a series where Lizzie always ends up in the afterlife with a new origin, usually 1 or 2 episodes per origin
This is probs my fav origin Lizzie!!!!!!!!!!!
I love ur sock on ur caracter
Love your vids!!❤️❤️
Hmmm it’s almost like the books are there past life
Evil lizzie is back...
I got a vid saying “Ldshadowlady will be a bird thingy,” THE HELL WE GUESSED IT BOIS
Are those all how you died
Wow
Lizzie dies every episode at this point😂
Lizzie has died a lot but now she might actually mysteriously die without us knowing
I hope everyone is feeling well right now ✅😱
Lizzie you are the best you are so cool i like all your videos they are the best
:)
I love the costume
She A Birb!
10:57 she caught herself XDD
The rooms resemble her origins
Me: *watched the new video* Also me: expects lizzie will die 2 times because she has died many times now and expects she will do 2 deaths per episode now
Keep your eyes on the prize till it dies
10:59 “What the f- blaze
HOW DID YOU DIE YOU DIED LIKE 10000000 TIMES😂😂😂😂
The secret is the house has all of youre past origins
i know the mystery of the base it is all her origins
12:25 , Lizzie you could have just led the parrots all the way to your home with your seeds lol.😂
HII
how did she spawn in the middle of nowhere??? also she will probably be the best enigma we have ever seen considering the fact that non of anyone could work out her skin... congrats on being confusing lizzie!!
Oh the kangaroo was so cool
Plot twist : Lizzie intentionally dies everytime to showcase the origins
ldshadowbirb
NEVER GO BACK TO THE NETHER AGAINNNNNNN
omg i was so paranoid if lizzie was gonna die again
Are you building your old origin in the the nooks cus beeang green plants=end floral?
You make the best videos of all time☺️
Parrot
53 MINS AGO? WHY DID I MISS THIS
Hiii Lizzy
I feel like Lizzie was doing this on purpose, the whole time I was so scared that she was going to die again, the end, the nether, the skeleton, the boar thing!
You dying too much it's almost as if you want to...
Finally
Lizzie! The mini map may expose the base, Be careful, and how the pins are located, it shows around where it is
Lizzie, ur vids are wonderful, you make me smile all the time. Pls do more videos like these
If you think about it, the “mysterious” decorations, are based of off her old origins. The color full one is her Floran, The one with red walls is the Racoon, the one with the colorful wool is the Birb, and the Cow Heads with the boat is the Kangaroo I think ?
I just thought about the little nooks and I think it’s all of her lives,her past lives and future lives
I love your skin I think you should crate a group and call it the Mister of after life
I think she going to be the first one out the after life smp
Sad that you died again;-;
I just saw it and it said 38 minutes ago
.
Yay been waiting to see your new orgin ❤️
the rooms are her past lives
Im starting to crack the mysterious decorations the Enigma is putting  Each decorations is a commemorative for past origins   The red and deepslate stands for the raccoon (its also the material for the raccoon house)  The beehive amd flowers stands for the End Floran  The Slime and Amethyst stands for the Alien origin  The Boat amd cactus with a cow head stands for the kangaroo the boat is the final moment before perishing and the cactus grows only in the dessert which kangaroo lives  And the parrot head is for the Birb
Yay u finally post
when i saw this video i was like "well let see how long this gonnna last"AND U DIED 2MIN INTO THE VIDEOO DONT EVEN KNOW HOW MANY TIMES U HAVE DIED
I now wot it is it ole the past Orichins OMG The at good
"what the f..... blazes is that?" -lizzie 2022
If Lizzie doesn’t join the Evil inc I’m going to be disappointed
I THOUGHT UR VIDEO WAS GONNA BE 2 MINUTES LONG CAUSE U IMMEDIATELY DIED
I solved the tiny areas it was her past ORIGINS so obvious
You die like........A LOT
I have a sinister idea for you! Make another nook in the wall and display the heads of the victims you have taken as your own
All those decorations based off all your life that you lost
Lizzy nearly swore lol
Each area is decorated to all your previous origins :)
The gaps in the house is lizzie orgims she had also I love your videos lizzie
Your headquarter is full of your pest origins
Your lives the stuff the bird
Yes kill the enders they killed  and laren
Its your living places of the past
Yeees
I wonder if Lizzie’s gonna get the shadow origin. It’ll be fitting because of her name
How did you oof under five minutes
But omg I love this series
Its so sad that you keep dying i want you to stay in the server so much i want you to stay longer 😢😢
LIZZIE'S PARROT SKIN IS THE PAN FLAG AAAAAAA <3 <3
I think she has gotten to evil for Kwai l Lizzy and her name is Elizabeth
It’s all her deaths
I love your videos keep up the hard work❤️👍
She’s gonna die again!
I like were the evil is going
Haven’t even gotten too far in the video and I’m already thinking “please don’t die, please don’t die pleaaase don’t dieee”
Hi
Can we all agree that Lizzy is so kind and cool? And I was surprised that she died so quickily <poor birb Lizzy> but oh well <3
Poor Lizzie. She gets a new power then dies immediately

hello
y e s
Ah yes a pansexual parrot 🦜   ( but not really)
OMG! I love your new origin it is soooo cute!
Lizzie "I am an Enigma" But literally 🤣
The “mysterious reasons” are all her past lives
AHHH A BIRDIE 🐦
It took me a long time to figure out all the nooks for her past lives………
love you Lizzie! i look forward to ur vids  all the time ^^
It's- it's- Evry little hole is a tribute to her past- YESSSSS
me: watching another video lizzie: posts afterlife video me: switch video switch video
I know what you are doing you are making things that are your past life's
I love your videos
2 minutes of lizzie being an a bird and then unalive
“My one weakness: being weak!”                           *~Lizzie 2022*
LDShadowLady I think all those nooks and crannies are all your past lives and I think I'm right cuz you just died and you were a bird and you're going to collect a bird and then there's a lot of plants in one milk and cranny so that your floren life and then there's the weird stuff you were using to make your alien home so it's pretty obvious
The enigma is by far, my favorite origin out of everyone's origins
Lizzie you and Lauren should have an alliance she's got a new origin that seems to be quiet powerful
The little hideout is sooo cuteeeee 😁😁 I think the mysterious decorations are so sweet to <3
either she died a whole bunch after this episode... or she released a bunch of skins to keep her identity an enigma
You are part of the tiny gang!!!
Omg this is my first time being this early
Maybe you can make puzzles near other player's base, to find treasure or to lead the into a trap or a scary place. And then keep on making more mystery near them and troll them with your ability.
Try not to die
Omg so cute 😸😍 Also I wasn't expecting a bird because nobody really talks about them.I have to pet birds my first one is gloom and my second one is Freddy😍🐔🐓🐦🕊️
I believe I can flyyy!!!
Two origins in one episode is either bad, or good? LIKE LIZZIE WHYYYY I LIKED THE BIRB
"What the f......lazers"
The sections are all of her lives so far
It said that you can hide in the shadows, right? Maybe you can stare at enemies from their shadows, where they can't reach you?  Or you can use your clone ability. Distract enemies with a clone while staring at them from a distance? Or kill them with am exploding clone.
I did not expect that Lizzy would have another Villian Arc again. We dont talk about K̸i̸n̸g̸d̸o̸m̸ C̸r̸a̸f̸t̸
I like that she decorated the rooms as her past origins
All decorations were decorated according to her origins
Another  shocking episode ,I kinda thought she would die at spawn.😫
It’s all your origins!
The top secret decorations are for your past lives Lizzie. I'm too smart 😏
here lies every origins she ever got
Ah I’m so excited! I’ve been waiting to see your next video 💕 I missed you 😭
STILL BE ANNOYING
So cool
ello, i shall call myself early
R u serious dies 3 mins into the vid-
The corners of your new house is actually what she used to be in the past
Hi
8:27 Map: I'm gonna ruin your entire career
Don't die again
Cool probably the best yet keep working hard we love your work lizzy
Hihhi
Lizze:A bird origin  Me: And ooooo  Lizze can fly Lizze  can fly  Lizze can fly
It is me or she almost said the f word
LIZZIE STOP GETTING THE CUTEST ORIGINS 😭😭❤️✨
Hi Lizzie! I hope you notice my comment, I have been a subscriber since 2016! Love you so much and keep up the good work! <33
Finally! someone else who knows they don't attack if you dont break the eye contact!
NEW IT
i like that a soon she gets the best origin ever she died like 10 seconds later
love how lizzie just dies instantly
Lizzie please slow down changing origin it's worrying
OH NO!! My one weakness:  Being weak
I have been wating for this
THAT WAS SO FUNNY WHEN LIZZIE ALMOST SWORE WHEN THE PIG ATTACKED HER LOL 😂
Lizzie I know why the decorations are there their your past lives as animals
enigma+parrot=curse and a blessing
Soooo coool Lizzie my 2nd favorite origin 😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤ p.s. love you so much your videos make me happy
FINALLY YOU POSTED
Lizzie pls don't die I wish that origin will won't last fast we love u Lizzie keep up the good work!
I love and the first part how you got To become bad but unfortunately that’s stupid zombie killed you
The nooks are just lizzys lifein the smp
The decorations in her base shows us all her past origins
please notice me!! I’ve watched all your videos ^^
Haven't watched the full video yet, but I'm exited! Hope this lasts longer than the last one 😁     Shoot
The nooks are your origins are they ?
Lizzie only has like four lives left 💀
i have the feeling like lizzie is going to be the first one to leave afterlife she kept dying
49 mins late
🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇
Finally an episode were Lizzie kept the an origin
all the nooks re lizzie's different lives
TINY LIZZIE MADE A COME BACK then died
Omg i loove your avatarrr
Dang ur skin is really cutee
hmm i wonder what those little “decorative rooms” are for i wouldn’t have an idea
Lizzie lost sanity at the end
Lol it gives me anxiety when lizzie is being chased of  the wild boar
maybe its close to past origin i guess if im wrong
Ok, I am 3 seconds in. Let's hope she doesn't die this episode        Edit: that was a.. interesting death
Om
ohhh i understand what those decoration nooks represent (well at least 3 of them) SPOILERS I GUESS: they represent her origins (amethyst for the slime, honey comb and pumpkin for the floran, and that parrot head for the birb!)
I'm scared... I'm very scared...😳
Lizzie please keep this origin as long as possible ✋😭
PLEASE JOIN SCOTT!! He needs some evil friends
I UNDERSTAND YOUR NEW SECRET BASE’S DETAILS NOW!            so basically the details are for your previous lives! Am I correct?
Lol
*Wow a bird?! What a cute origin! I sure hope she doesn't die and lose this one super quick, that would be just drastic-*
The the ................blazers is that
Did anyone else notice the parrots leg? It was the pan pride flag. Coincidence? (Edit: it was the enigmas leg, not the parrots 😅)
I understand those nooks are inspired by you or other origins 🦝💐🦘
Hi
Ah are the small little nooks a reference to all of her origins? Cause it seems it
Sheesh I love parrots!
"why you would have to be some sort of problem solving genius to understand the complexities of such a mystery" each nook is designed to resemble something from your past origins right?
lizze:whhat the f-blazes
JOIN LAUREN AS A VILLAIN. 😭
Lizzie was a birb for 1 minuet then dies 💀
I think I  Know what the reason in her house it to rember all her live  Bird raccoon flower person and I don't remember the third one
Each nook is for each of her past origins, pretty sure we all realized that right?
The “decorations” in her home are showing all of her origins
Everyone: she dies immediately when she gets good origin Me: *BIRB*           Also she might die 10 times.. and then- yeah………
thank you for uploading i have been waiting
Do they represent your past origins? 10:28
House nooks are for past live
do that little places that you build was it the origins that you had in the past
OMG I AM SOMEHOW EARLY (WITHIN AN HOUR) LOLL
Lizzie what have you done.. your on your 6th life!! I wish you a long life.. hopefully
❤
It seems Lizzie and Joel are racing to see who can loose all their lives first
I know that the walls have to do with her past origins but the bookshelf one is weird, it may have to do with her villagers
3 more lives 😥 I don't want lizze to leave this series early
DID LIZZIE ALMOST CURSED?
Has anyone else thought that it took 50 years for her to post?
All lizzies orgins in the headquaters...
Lizzy Dies dromaticaly fast*
hi
I LOVE YOU LIZZIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
pretty sure she just dies every episode
I think for the decorations is the lives she had
47mins
Kingdom craft?
The decorations represent all of her afterlife origins
I wonder if this will help her get into the villain squad if there is one... I mean Lauren killed you to get in one
Ldshadowlady I wasn't expecting two origins I just more happier
"Oh no! My only weakness, Being weak!" Lizzie / Ldshadowlady 2022
i know what the nooks are they are nooks for all of lizzies other lives
OMG!!! :)
Lizzy almost said F### but she is still my fav YouTuber
Lizzie just SPEEDRUNNINGG her lives.
EARLY
OMG I AM SO EARLY I LOVE YOUR VIDSSS
LIZZIE!! STOP DYING!!!
She’s dying in the most stupid ways
I hope everyone has a great day! :D
The decorations were here past lifes
Lizzie gets the best origins I love all of them and their so entertaining! (But again, Lizzie can make anything entertaining)
Lizzie please do not die, I fo not want you to be the first person to get out of the series.
Finally lizzie!
lizzie prank your friends with you enigma powers ^^ *villain laughs*
Lizzie and scott would be the most powerful villain 😍
Wow Lizzie! U look amazing as an enigma!<333 I love your videos a lot and you inspire me to try new and amazing things! Please keep making these fun videos!<3
I know at all the rooms in your base are represent all of you life's so far
She is on her 6th animal
Lizzie pls no more death jajsjndnehejnxje
How much times has Lizzie died? We will never know
Lizzie just keeps getting smaller and smaller  Edit: the hight difference from empires has switched Lizzie is small and Joel is tall when in empires it was the other way around!
Hi lizzie im a big fannnn😁😁😁❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
GIRL I GET SO ANGRY WHEN YOU DIE NOW YOU DIE IN THE FIRST MIN OF THE VIDEO DANG
so each nook and cranny represents all the origins she’s been! The cow and boat one being the kangaroo, the one with all the end flowers and honey being the floran, the one with the copper and amethyst being the alien, the one with all the jumble of stuff being a raccoon, and the parrot head for the parrot!
am excited!! maybe u shud form a secret group or alliance of some kind
😯🥰😍🤩🦜
that bird looks kinda like the pan flag-
somewhere around 10.24min i know the reason it is your past origin pls reply if im right lizzie
10:58 LIZZIE ALMOST SAYS THE F WORD
Yoooo am here
The"Enigma" Origin is my Favorite now 😁
You didn't die
Its all ur life's I'm pretty sure ur rooms are
I think that the nooks represent her past lives.
I loved this episode keep up the good work
“Oh my gosh this is so cute! I hope she stays like this for more than one episode”  “Oh…”
Mod for tools please
Omg yass queen also early!
Finally a video where she can keep one origin at the end!
Lizzy is scaring me with all the death
The tone in her voice during the outro actually kind of scared me 😂
I love how every episode lizzy post, it never fails to make our day  its so funny plis (and the effort she makes to make 1 eps is wow)
Don't forget that you can become invisible and phase through solid blocks, teleport behind anyone, and clone yourself. Your stare ability is totally weak when not combined with your other powers of ultimate sneakiness. It's just too slow for a head on battle.
You and Joel are having a race to see who can end the series quicker
love it
2:14 the most unfair death is history
Ok I think we all know what the secret is.  (It’s all her past origins)
HI LIZZIE! I’m a gaint fan!!
Omg she dint die again I thought she was gonna get all 10 deaths finallyyyyyyy a normal episode   Lizzieeeweeeee donttt dieeeee plssssss not again for the power of water melon shugarrrrrrrr
the nooks are soooooo cute!
Lizzie can i pls have a heart n btw people who killed players must have revenge and i love your videos <3
Are the mysteries thw origins you have had because the wool one is the parrot the amathest is the alien the stick is racoon and the flower one is the florist
I just started if she dies I swear
lizziwe just nearly cursed lol
i actually want to know if theres an angel one😺
Lizzy by chance would like to join the ex league of horror ( after me and Scott get evil roles again) so what do you say
HELP ME!!! LIZZIE'S BIRD ORIGIN WAS THE MOST EPIC EVER HAHA
What the ffff- BLAZES IT THAT, lmao lizzie
. Lizzy it’s obvious the colored thing and the other nooks are your old origins
Gillian arc???
I love how lizzie works so hard on her videos she's amazing
No only 4 more lives to go and you will be banned pls stay safe lizzy
Early :D
omgg!!! Omg!! I've waited for 2 weeks for this!!! I'm so excited 💜💜🥺😩
I was like "OMG LIZZIE IS A CUTIE PINKIE BIRDDD!" THEN SHE DIESS!!!! I WAS LIKE "TWO ORIGINS IN ONE EPISODEE!? tbh means to be honest. Tbh I liked your bird origin better. YOU WERE LIKE WHEN YOU DIED "I JUST LITERALLY WENT AND STARTED VENTURING THE LAND AND FOUND THIS NICE CUTE AND PINK BIOME!! THEN A FRICKING ZOMBIE KILLED YOU!!!!!!!!!
Early 44 mins!!
Wilbur soot’s power is the enigma but he’s called phantom
Wow organs making you a furry lmafo
Lizzie:you will never find out why I put these decor here me: it’s because of each of your different origins you’ve had love you Lizzie
Lizzie almost said the f word "What the F-fff-Blazes is that? "
Lizzie: gets a cute origin …   “Guess I’ll die!”
When you made the red Decoration Ariea it is bast off your racoon home and the one with Amethyst is your  👽home.
hiii
Youre base or headquarters is made to represent all your old origins?
Stop dying!
I did not expect a bird. Also I LOVE you videos and if I got 1 dollar each video Iv watched oh boy will I be a trillion air ❤ 💙 💜 💖 💗 💘 ❤ 💙 💜 💖 💗 💘 ❤
Lol I feel So BAD▪︎
She’s straight up speed running her life on the server
Omg 43 minute ago  late~
Wow, shes so good at minecraft, building that is. Not living. She dies too many times
Am I watching this while searching my house for my discarded libre, because I took it off and no longer can find it (was it supposed to go straight to the trash, yes…. Idk where it is TnT) am I going to rewatch this when I can fully sit and watch, yes, till then wish me luck, and great job Lizzy, your content is enjoyable as always
Don't kill the birds!! I love birds ❤🐦🐦   Btw I am your fan
All the nooks are her origins
LIZZE STOP DIEING😭😭
Enigma is probably THE coolest power ever. Lizzie being a parrot and being excited to fly only to die 5 minutes later is just pure sadness but being an Enigma is perfect for Lizzie lol
I loved your video and btw the reason you spawned in a dessert is because one of your kangaroo abilities was you spawn in a dessert.
Pog
OMG a bird ♥️!! You made my day xxxxx I might of Brocken/twisted my ankle but this made it just magically heaL!!, 🥹
The nooks are the origins you’ve had and memories!
When will she join the villains? I’m hoping she will
Finally!!!!!😭😭😭
Wow
The enigma in her base is that every decoration has to do with her past origins I think it's kinda obvious lol. Btw was not expecting two deaths today!
I love the nooks sm I shouted “aww” and my sister was concerned KFBDKSHSJ
Finely you didn’t die Ow I forgot uhmmmmmm bye
OH the nooks are each of her origins!
Claim your here under an hour ticket ⬇️

Something tells me she will lose quite soon…
Hi
10:57 literally me whenever I am at work LMAO
Ooh the rooms are all your past lives
Your nucs in your house are your lifes
Lizzie: what the f.... blazes is that?!
Can't the enigma phase through all blocks? Seems like a pretty useful way to hide from mobs
3:51  DIE PIG!  *Millions of years later* Any second now… 😕 …      Death WILL consume you.         Just. Youuuu. Wait.
U have 4 more lives Lizzie
I think she build and design her old origin for memories of her i guess
Lizzie pls try to survive, a new origin is so chaotic by you lol.😭
YAY! FINALLY A NEW VIDEO!! OMG
i love the new skin<3!
Not going lie I was holding my breath every time Lizzie look like she was about to die. But I am just glad she finished the episode with out losing another life. Well done Lizzie 👍
Lizzie at the end of the series can you do a video where you says the mods and stuff?
YESSSSSSSSSS (You will never know why I just yes)
i love how she put her past lives/biomes in her house
Do those nooks match your past lives? That’s what it looks like to me!! :>
Did you see the origing board it says a birb
rip bird amazing video
Bro that was so awesome (you hate when you die)
Lizzie do you live in katherine’s mountain?
I know what the room met its all your past origins
I'm not too laTe
PLEASE mess with some people it will be so funny BTW LOVE Your new origins
You almost said F****

Hi comments!
I love how you made the room have a little piece of something from your last life

Wake up guys lizzie just posted!!!
THE DECORATION IS ALL HER LIVES IN AFTER LIFE
copy pasting voices
Lizzie is a role model to me as an english minecraft  player  called lizzie myself love her so much and this was so cute!
Is kinda unsuprising that Lizzie will die
lizzie has done it again 🐢💓
Am I the only one that thinks that that the decorations represent lizzy's old lives, if not please comment if you had the same idea as me on that.
Did anyone realize the flag in Lizzie's colour palette when she was a bird? ITS THE PANSEXUAL FLAG Y'ALL WHY DO I ALWAYS FIND FLAGS IN EVRYTHING-
All of the crevices in the secret base are her past lives XD, that’s really creative and cute
I just hope she doesn't die in the next episode
Hi Lizzie! Damn this is my first time being early! Thanks for making awesome videos.

"Sorry whoever's portal that is, but you have a new guest, a new guest has arrived and his name is death". HAHAHAAHHAHAHAHHAA

I love how the little nooks reflected on your past lives! And thank goodness you finally kept a origin for more than one day.
this isn’t bad luck, it’s what you call Lizzie being Lizzie
Lizzie the map gives away your location kinda :/. She’s making things from her past lives
I GET IT NOW THOSE WERE ALL OF YOUR ORIGINS LIKE THE LITTLE NOOKS
Ahhh! I love your videos so much lizzieee! ♥️ ❤️
only 39 minutes but already 3.2k comments😬🤩
Ur the same as shubble!
she died and got a new origin and the vid didn't end so I immediately assumed she'd die twice in one video cause like that's how she ends her vids by dying
Oh Liz I. So so sad
The nucs are all her origans
NEW RECORD! 2 Origins STOP DYING PLEASEEEEE  edit: we can see your base on the mini map lizzie......  edit 2: the decorations are your past lives, it wasn't that hard
Lizzie I love your videos keep up the hard work we love you bye 💘💖💘💖
I saw birb. I checked the length of the video. I thought "wow, 13 minutes. I'm surprised it is so long". And.. Well...
lizzie : gets a cute origin Later...  *dies*
I’m 40 minutes late
me:watching 2 week every day check every day
STOP DEING NOWWW JHBrgrfphrfphi

I love your Video so much and keep up the hard work I love so much have a good day
Another exciting after life episode! I hope she doesn’t die immediately! I hope… pls…
“I left this world just as I came into it, a hole” so funny
next episode you should  put the head on a nest of coral like you posted a coupel days ago
It is all her old origins that is why she needs a bird
EARLY! Also Love the vid
me watching this : pls dont die *she dies in 2 minutes* me : 😶
The mysterious decor were her origins
Love how she built things about her previous origins in her home lmao-
I'VE BEEN WATCHING LIZZIE SINCE 2015 AND I NEVER STOPPED AND I WON'T ANY TIME SOON
I have been waiting for this
Early!!
OH MY GOD!!!! I really hope lizzie is not getting out of this series soooo soon
I am so glad that Lizzie turned into an enigima. If she got any other origin, I have a feeling that she would have died
since youre an enigma now you should make a dark room with only black blocks. you should also kill every animal you can and display it like an artifact in the dark room AND CALL IT SINISTER ROOM!!
all of the nooks are your previous origins
Poor Lizzie died as a cute bird 🕊️ 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Each decoration is each of your origins
Your skin is Cute as hekk😍
She made the nooks because those were her last 5 recent origins
I really hope you don't die in the next episode
How are there 3,222 comments... It's only been 37 minutes
Was the enigma origin based off bird box? 🪶📦
fun drinking game - take a shot every time lizzie dies in afterlife
Me .happy that lizzy got a bird lizzy .zombie don't kill me  Me. Nooooooooooo Lizzy. Um  Me. How many times are you going to die!?!!?
UR THE BESTTTTTT YOUTUBER
good episode lizzie!
Finally an episode where she does not die.
I just love this series! I will do anything to watch your videos. Keep going, Lizzie!
okay it’s been 2 minutes
omg lizzie finally didn't die at the end of the episode!
Don’t die lizzie!!!!  💖 💔
i have a feeling that your gonna die again next episode
Villlan arc 👀
Post more often
I think some pf the decorations are about Lizzie’s past lives. You can see honeycomb, beehives and end plants in one nook,  which is the Floran. You see a red wall with a deepslate roof, which is the raccoon. The white wall with cow heads and a boat is Kangaroo Lizzie, because she pranked Scott with boats and SeePeeKay with cows and snow. The parrot head is from her Birb life. The amethyst with copper rods is her spaceship from when she was a Goolien. The bookshelf is mysterious, so it’s her current life as an Enigma.
the enigma headquarters has things to represent her past lifes
I feel the nooks are the old biomes she used to live in with her old origins. Keep up the good work Lizzie!
It’s your past life’s
9:52 - 10:00 The mystery was that she shows her other origins and what she made/did or how she died in those spots I figured it out when she placed the slime.
your avatar is so cute😁
Did anyone else notice that her new base and skin represents something from her last 5 lives? That's a cool little touch
Ohh I know the decors 😏 u made tiny recreations of ur old bases
I'm the most oldest subscriber
10:58 not her almost saying something else ✋😭
welp all my guess were not right i thought you were a dod bird or flamingo but guess your a parrot-
Is Lizzie Pan????
Lizzie: what the f—-blazes was that
is this her fifth origin already?
I havent watched it yet but hopefully She will Not die Yet😭
I know why you did all the 'Nooks' before you finished them :)
I wonder when Lizzie will take more revenge
hilarious that she adores being a pink bird but then dies almost immediatly HAHA we all saw that coming lmao
The little nooks are all of the houses you have had
Your videos always make my day better
I-is this lizzie's villian arc..
Wow like your 7nd origin it is so awesome
im early !!!!!!!!!!!!
9:34 As someone who's favorite color is orange, you can never have too much orange
Enigma origin is the start of your villain arc and Im here for it.
Hello
The “decorations” are her past lives
i have a guess of what the mysterious decorations are there all based off your past lives
Hmmm I think shes making little decorations based on her old lives.
They are all related to your pervious lives <3
I have been checking her page for the past week for a new video....
there all her oregens
It's a mystery how Lizzie always dies in the first episode of a new origin
This series is so good! I love your color palette too! I hope you guys get to ep 20+ since i really love all the custom stuff and the Origins.
Did Lizzie Almost Say the F word?!?🧐😮
after waiting for a long time she has finally uploaded
omg lizzie just died last episode and now again
Are each of those nooks a previous origin? Just a suspicion! Also, for your next video, can you make a conjoined base with an ally?
new ORIGIN YES!! iwas waiting for you to post!! And here is it!! Btw loveee ur vidss! ^^ ❤️
I love your videos so much I got super excited when I saw you uploaded and came straight here 😍
The question now is not if she'll die, But when she'll die  Also friendly reminder she only has 5 lives left.
31 min early
I knew it you are a bird then a enigma
this is probably my favorite origin so far!!! possible villian arc in the future?
LIZZIEEEEE; BE CAREFULL, I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE THROWN OUT OF THE SERVER FIRST!!!
The amount of stress I underwent everytime you were about to die 😐
I think you should join the League of villains
lizzie almost swore lmao
I love your channel and my sister has been watching your channel for like 4 years now
Cute✨✨
I all ready figured the decorations out the decorations based off of the origins
me: Omg my god the holy queen parrot  My father: What?!
I loved this ep! Can't wait for the next mistery.  Also that last bit scared me lol! New villain im town, or just a mistery?  No one.. knows....
Those nooks were your past lives
Lizz stop dying plz
congratulations for reaching 43 millions views from 100 days in minecraft
Anyone else realised that there was a lot of things with the pansexual flag in this video today?
love you lizzieeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!
For anyone wondering, the mystery of her decorations are her past origins, however I don’t understand how the last 2 equal kangaroo
Omg i thought lizzies going to die two times in this episodes😂

im pretty sure this is a world record of deaths, u have died in every ssingle episodes of afterlife xd
I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING
10:27 I think the nooks Represent her deaths
Same as her husband
Lizzie I  love your videos
I know what the decorations are about there are shrine for your lives you died as!
Each nook in her sEcReT base is her lives.
Yasssss
OMGGGGGGGGG lets hope and pray your new one isn't like your last 4 lives (OMG like this is her 6th life shes almost gone). Also lizzies new origin really gives me evil villain vibes
not even 5 minutes in she dies as a cute little parrot and then she gets the exact opposite. xD
Hii Lizzie!! i was not expecting a bird! I love you lizzie!💖
this is my favourite episode! Cant wait for episode 9 :DD
YAYY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Her bird is pansexual colored!
Bro I got scared because she didn't send a video I thought she was dead
Lizzie , I’m too smart for your Enigma whatever it’s called . It’s your origins
Lizzy said a bad word
I am here before an hour
Hey ldshaddowladie
Hiiiiiiiii
I feel like for the secret base the small rooms are memorials of your other origins hehehe I solved the mystery!! Love the base btw
Quit dying Lizzie
Please dont die again, please lizzie
Birb lizzie lived a short life of around 2 mins and 15 secs
Love your videos
I love lizzie she is so cute she always bring exciting, fun and amazing contents. I have not patience , I can't wait to she the latest videos she posts 🥰🥰
I know you were building you’re building a little thing for each origin
Lizzie has been reborn again -_-
Wait are those corners represent what you used to be in after life?
The nunks are her life’s
1:13  😮 put on replay as much as possible
Every nook is on of her differtent lives
Oh im so sorry
IM NOT LATE also great vid
Hi
She dies almost every episode
I like how lizzie is gradually becoming comfortable in change.  She doesn't usually upload videos of her saying a bad word but... she almost said a bad word there hahahaha
Lizzie if you can walk through the waterfall does that means the mobs could walk the waterfall?
this video hes inspire me to put my video ,my warrior cats story, on youtube
I love how lizzie keeps dying every episode lol, can you notice lizzie Im a big fan
Lizzie I have officially said you’ve gone crazy
rip birb Lizzie
THIS WAS POSTED ONLY 35 MINUTES AGO? DANG IM EARLY
I think the decorations represents her other lives
Ij    MUUUUUH
I love this!Can you pleaselike Lizzie?
Praying lizzie dont die this episode because i love birds
I KNEW SHE WAS GONNA BE A BIRB! *literally 2 minutes later* **dies**
So cool😃😃😃👌👌👌
Are the crooks in your new place all themed based on your origins you’ve had?
I know what the nook is! It’s all your diffrent origins!
Omg, lizzy got through an entire episode as the same origin (not counting birb as it was for only 3 mins
Everyone! Let's welcome Our well loved Racoon's successor, the Enigma
LDS: Just taking these RED Sand Sand: BRO AM A FRICKIN ORANGE  me when hearing: AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHZ HAHAHAAHHAHAHA🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
IM EARLY :D
I BE WAITING ALL WEEK FOR THIS VIDEO :D
“WHAT THE F…. BLAZES IS THAT??” almost slipped up there lizzy-
koolaid
ohhhh the nooks are reprecentation of her prevuos lives
To anyone that couldn't tell, the nooks in the new base are representations of previous lives
How many times has she died? And will she update the wall of her lives?
It’s from all her past lives I think
Early for once!
I see some..Pansexual just saying
I have one question: is the bird pan?? 🕊🏹🎞
I can understand that some parts are your past origins  The 2nd one is your floran identity The 3rd is your goolin identity the 5th is your raccoon identity And the 6th is your parrot identity  Can’t figure out what the other 2 are or where kangaroo fits in though
I've been waiting for this video forever!!!!!!!! I love your videos and I am currently watching this in my bed as I have covid... Keep up the great work lizzie!!!
I been watching u for 1 year and i am 10 years old<3<3<3<3
AHHH SHE POSTED
Hello Lizzie I have been waiting for this vid I was thinking that something what missing like yo 🥳 New vid
Theory: she’s dying quickly so she can end the series to plan empires 2! Who agrees? ⬇️
FINALY AFTER SO LONG...  THE QUEEN HAS RETURNED
I know what the decorations are about
Fingers crossed she can survive for a few episodes
Not the birb!!,!!!!!!!!,
omg i luv yor origin
People have been saying you are trying to end this sieries Quick I would love to see more tho
Yeah yeah. NOW STOP DYING!!!
There is a section on all of your lives, which are also merged in your skin :) Nice 👍
The mistery is your death
The episode didn't end with a death! I'm so proud 🥲
I KNOW WHY THOSE ROOM THINGYS ARE THERE!!!! THOSE ARE THE PREVIOUS LIFES OF ENIGMA LIZZIE!!!
its very ad to see you die in almost every episode but at the same time i love all the origins youve been getting and that we can see more
Omg you died again that's hilarious
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD WHEN THE MOBS WERE CHASING LIZZY!?    	SOMEONE SAID  “ WAITTTT WAITTTTT”
YESSSS
Birds: *cant be tamed by lizzie* Lizzie: So you have chosen   d e a t h ?
Ofcourse she died in an episode again 🤣 I'm loving these origins you're getting!!
Omggg why do you keep burning through lives Lizzie??????
The nooks look like Lizzie's origins like the one with the cow looks like a  kangaroo since Lizzie's annoying pranks to her friends. The other nook Which has the end flowers is Floran. The other one with the amethyst is Goolien (correct me if im wrong lol) then the Racoon with the materials she did to do her Racoon house then the last one is the parrot origin. Idk i may be wrong or something! Love your vids!!!
33 MINS AGO AHHHH <3 LOVE UR VIDS
Lizzie didn't even try to hide her base. The map, the water fall, when she was leaving and coming in.
I know the thing you said only smart people can figure  out but I'm only 7 and I think your bases that you had and lost
you get such cute skins all the time but you always die each episode XD
Yay a bird!!!!!
She gets the origins that suit her then she play for a little bit and dies for something dumb
you have served your origin well lizzie. as an enigma, you definitely got us with all of our discombobulated excited minds.
Pls just don't die 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
YOU FINALLY UPLOADED IVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!
Intro:so energized get killed by a zombie  got a enigma origin Outro:became mysterious and cold.
I love your videos they make my day
HOW DO U KEEP DYING
Lizzy almost said f
I know what the mystery is
Omg I thought I was early because this was posted 30 minutes ago but so many people have already seen this T-T
FINALLY, I though you died and I was so sad, but nope you were planning an all mighty revenge as the now villain (reminds me of the kingdomcraft days!)
The little rooms are her last origins
Am I the only person to realise that every corner is a different origin
lol, she is like a mix of all of her origins   Love it
Amazing it’s 12:18 in Australia I’m up with my friend at a sleepover and this was posted at 11:40
She finally survives for moving one episode but the bird survive for two minutes
Kinda early :D
"it's perfect" *sinister voice* (as animal heads are on the walls)  "what the f- blazes is this??"
Hello!
I know the mystery of the getting a bird it's all her past lives
Total Luna Lovegood vibes from Lizzie's Enigma house
All the decorations represent all her past lives, did you know?
It's here death for each origin in the nooks
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hi Lizzie! I miss your videos im glad to see your new vid again! ❤️
What took you so long l
i'm genius!
aya! New video! oops i mean yay lol
It the hall of deaths of all her origins and can I have a shout out today is my birthday
Lizzie : What the fu##-blazes
Lizzie is really out here speed running the origins xD All jokes aside, i honestly really love the skins, keep up the good work!
I feel like at this point Lizzie is just purposefully killing herself LOL she's already lost so many lives and the first things she wants to do is stare at Endermans and Ghasts 💀
10:58 I did not imagine that sentence (almost) coming out of Lizzie's mouth!
love your vids!
I late!
Omg the little nooks are her past origons
I blame the spawn area for sending u to a cave that caused your death
the fact that lizzie dies every episode 💀
I know what the secret decorations mean
how many lives does she have left? don't they only get 10 lives 😭
more.deaths. just . every . epesode xD
:0 A pansexual flag bird.
Lizzie         Joel            🤝  Dying as soon as they get a new origin
Love your vids so MUCH!!!
HER SKINS ARE ALWAYS SO CUTE OML
😅LD shadowlady you can be scary sometimes hehe cig ijkojhvrdfvbjkkmkjhvgchnmkm
After 3 episodes ending in death, enigma lizzie lives to be in more than 1 flipping episode    Also are my ears deceiving me or did lizzie say the f word---
Why how?
The nooks represent her former origins.
all the nooks are all the lives that she has lived
i find how lizzie cant last over one episode now as a single origin litterally she is on her 6th origin now  [edit] also the video is exactly 13 minutes and thats why she is so unlucky
SHE SED F
Oh Lizzie I thought you hated orange
That’s so sad that u already died :(
LIZZIE DIES AGAIN?!? 🤨🤨
woooow this orgin sounds sooo interesting u better not die!
finally
hi ahhh i love birds!! and you died
SHE LIVES ANOTHER DAY
Let's gooooo i love it
i do like this type of vid but she always dies after making some big transformation and she does not put vid often   i am sorry
I had a theory on this!
Why does the bird skin look like the pansexual flag- sorry my first thoughts seeing it as a pansexual :>  Edit: I have seen the enigma skin, the pansexual flag is there. LDShadowlady, thank you. P.S. Keep up the good work.
I love how your houes shows off the Origins you had
what origin is Lizzie on now?
Her series is going to end first.🤦 Also we have a new villain.
waterfall home is right by the spawn..XD saw it bc of the map
I love the little -shrines towards your old lives- I MEAN mysterious rooms that no one knows the point of... wOOOooOoOoOoO
Guys..........Lizzie just survived with an origin for 1 ep. thats a blessing
Pls more pls more plsssssssssssss😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😥😢😥😢😥😥😥😔😔😔😔😔😱😱😱😱😟😩😩😩😩😩😣😣😣😣😣😣
I really like the skin art you did a great job
Please don’t die again😭😂
All these leagues of villains and heros, and then there's Lizzie.
Early
Lizzie discovers so many unique biomes always cute, stay safe everyone🧑‍🍼💞
Lizzie has four lives already! I hope she can last as an enigma for at least THREE episodes 😫Joel Seapeekay and Lizzie just live to die at this point LOL LIZZIE IF YOU SEE THIS YOU HAVE TO SURVIVE 😭
the nooks are her past origins!
Is it a birb? Is it a plane? It's an enigma!
Lizzie villain arc?
@LDShadowLady      Please make this a villain ark
In the Secret Base,some of them look like her past orgins
I love how the title is I can fly even tho she barely did it
🦜 Lizzie
its just your past orgins not mystertyis reaons lizze.
Finally! An origin she can keep for more than one episode.. I was starting to feel stress! 😅 don’t want her serie to end
Lizzie almost swore…… alri clipp that clip that jk
SHE SURVIVED AN EPISODE OMGGGG AHHHHH  😆😆😆😆
Me: How many times have you died Lizzie: Yes
I’m a bird *Has Selected birb* This diorite is not Suffstacated (Sorry I spelt that completely wrong) Here is my living room and the most precious Decorations meanwhile it’s cow heads. Lizzie you are my idol I look up to you and you motivate me keep it up Parrot! Ahh *Tame Tame Tame*.  Me: u were a parrot 2 minutes ago lol. Wait I can’t tame things I can’t kill thing oh noo
Aww you always manage to get the cute origins!
Now she can’t kill mobs with out of tools she probably going to be a live long💕☺️
Apparently I'm a problem solving genius because as soon as you started working on the second one I knew what you did there :D
Lizzie always gets the best origins :D Also- early! :DDDDD
Wait this is so cool your skin is amazing I love how much effort you put into your videos and generally everything great work and I wish you luck for after life
Lizzie I'm scared 😐
Wow Lizzie is surviving for a whole episode call the media
I'm questioning her sanity at this point.
I feel like at this point Lizzie is dying on purpose :(
Soooo sool
Totally not her old origins being the decoration
💖💕
I LOVE YOU LIZZIE YOU MAKE MY DAY BETTER WHEN I SEE YOUR POSTS💗
First you were a raccoon then you were a flower lady and then you became an alien to a bird to become staring contest lady
Today Parrot insant death then Medusa (basically)
lizzie u should join the league of villains
I love how both the bird and the leg on her skins were the pan pride colours :) They looked so cute <3
dying as a beautiful and majestic creature and coming back alive as something more scarier seems like something only lizzie would experience
Yay another vid
30 min. early gang btw lizzie i was waiting for your next video for days,it was worth the waiting yhou never let us down
Lizzie I LOVE YOU
Please ldshadowlady don't trust  anyone to survive
bird: 😊❤️🙈🦜 enigma: 🩻💀☠️🏴‍☠️⚰️⛓
Omg Can We appriceate How Cute Lizzy Makes Her Avatars Like There Sooo Cute!
Is this lizzie's evil arc? Mysterious and hated by all?
The misterous thing is ur wee nooks are each origin u have had
omg u killed the cyan bird XD. love ur channel btw
soooooooooooooooo cute always
I love every single skin she uses they are all amazing
Hi Lizzie! you always inspire me everytime you post a new video. Continue to make everyone have a smile on their face everyday
Lizzie I have a question is it possible to get the same Origen from before
Omg your a bird I love this series
FINALLY an after life smp where lizzie doesn't die at the end so we cant expect new origin next ep
Hmmmm, her feathers remind me of something....   A flag may be
The mystery area things are all her old origins
I'm Early! YES✨ Also It always makes my day better when you upload Lizzie! Thank you!✨^^
Born in a hole, then died in a hole... What a PITy.
Those decorations represents your different origin that you had before 😁....(my guess)
All of those "mysterious decorations" are of all lizzie's past origins. Does this mean I'm a genius??
The birb didnt make a birb house
I think her house interior is based on her past origins
LDHidesInTheShadowsLady
I think the Little nooks I like her last live that she's had previously
Nooooooooo
She's building something to represent her what's her origin
Lizzies house are full of references to her past lives everyone!
She killed a parrot, which she used be
Love your Videos Lizzie ●︿●●︿●
Get revenge by capturing a barracuda and a zombie inside a chamber. 😈
I am liking this "insanity questioning" Vibe. Keep up the good work!
Pretty sure the books represent old bases/origins? or am I wrong 😭
I'm loving the cute pan flags on your origin skins!
She finally lasted more then one episode in an origin, HOORAY, wait *THAT'S ORIGIN 5, NOOOOOOOOOO*
Why does Lizzie die in every episode 😭😭😭
AAAAA YOUR SO CUTE AS A BIRD I NEVER THOUGHT THIS IT'S SO AMAZING AND CUTEE LIZZE!! ❤❤
I noticed what your decorations for your room was it was all of your past lives
First
Lizzie: "you have to be a master mind to solve these" Me: (when she was making the raccoon one) o shes making her past origins Edit: I think I'm early?
CAWWWW! Lizzie is a birb ^^ Ah- nvm An enigma? :0 Enigma Lizzie is scary XD
I might be wrong but I love how she made it that the extra parts of her house her past origins
Lizzie... at this rate you'll be out of the server by the end of next month
29 mins ang 2.8k comments
FINALLY SHE DOESNT DIE
Early finally! I fricken remember all Lizzie’s old videos it’s been a while! Keep it up girl! Ur so funny! 😂💞🫶🏼
Here before a hour     👇
Hiiiiiiii I love u
Oooo Hi!!!!!!!
BIRB
Honey I'm a red panda I'm adorable
Hi lizzie!!😍
Yayy love your orginis lizzyy ❤❤
You didn’t even get to ride on someone’s back 😞
I just love how Lizzie didn’t even last 2 minutes as a bird but the proceeds to kill a bird as something else :,)
OMGGGGGG you died so much time!!!!!
Love u
Wow!!! A new origin we haven’t seen yet! I cant wait for new adventures with this new origin!
Hey Lizzie I think I know what your little nooks are in your house it's a little piece of each of your past lives on the server hope I'm right 💜
28 minutes late anyways i am excited for the next video hope you don't die again
another video of my favourite minecraft youtuber
all of those rooms are all of her lives on the smp that she has ever been
Lizzie was 2 minutes as a bird. But I like the enigma better.
the real mystery is if lizzie would survive until next episode 🤫
The nooks are based on her past lives
Scott: *becomes the good guy Angel* Lizzie: *becomes the bad gal Enigma*  The tables have turned. 😎
All your lives are different nooks
Oh! Are those little areas based off your old lives?
I think the mod somehow glitched, because Lizzie was supposed to spawn in a desert as a kangaroo last time, but instead she spawned there in this life instead.
Stop saying she’s a bird guysss😩 She’s obviously a birb🤦‍♀️
I don’t think you should keep dying lizzy. You only have 5 more lives and they are dropping like flies! Your videos are amazing and I look up to you. 💕 ❤️
“That was Joel’s hole!” Uhhh Lizzie? 😳
I like how she designed her base to have parts of her past origins in it and her skin has parts of the origins too
The cubes are from Lizzie’s afterlives
I am glad you didn't die again also your new origin makes me think you are a Hitman for some reason
Hello great video keep it up
I understand the mysterious thing-
I LOVE IT! YOUR THE BEST!
What mids do u use?
I love orange so it is very pleaseing to the eye! We all love you!
Omg hello I’m here in the first 30 minutes of u posting this🙂🙂🙂 can I get a hot out pls?
Love u lizzie! U make my day also a cool name for a pet would be grawp pronounced grop
She almost swore💀💀
So many deaths!
Lizzie u know if die 10 times ur out of the server forever
Each of the little nooks, resemble her past lives ❤️
When you died as a parent that was a cool thing that you got a new origin to the super cool but how did you die when you when you got to be a bird
I solved the mystery of the interior design lol
Ok so I have concluded, Lizzie has gone a little crazy. And I'm all for it
I think i know the decorations mean they are her diffrent origins.
Lizzie is doing speedrun in ALSMP 🗿🙂
The decorations r for her old origins lol
You can be a villian now xd
The sections in your house are all base off your past orgins! That's so cool!
The decorations r for her old origins lol
Wait I just noticed your skin is a mixture of all your past origins, but I dont see a raccoon. 🦝
So, are we not gonna talk about how shes putting every single origin shes already had in her base?
Therefore all The Times you died in after life SMP All right
💅
I bet she'll die in the next ep
that is your origin older
WOOHOO NEW VIDEO
I wonder how many lives she has left. . 😅
FINALLY! I’ve been looking forward to this episode. I was trying to find out your origin from many conspiracy theories but it’s finally here! Was very confused along with other people with the skins lol.  edit: after watching the video, it fits your new origin. trickery and confusion.
(Edited) Here within 30 mins of posting shoutout plz Edit: ur my fav
i hate that the lizze will not be on afterlife SMP soon But i love the ways llizze puts all the effort to just make these And lizze is making the episodes more intresting by dying which makes me so exited to see her new origin
I think her decoy was all of her origins
Am I the only one who noticed her stopping herself from swearing-
All of those nooks in Lizzie's base are themed around her previous Origins!! THAT'S SO CUTE.
Lizzy is turning evell !!!!!!!!!
Why do you post so late like I don't understand PLEASE post more early
OMGGG YESSS EARLY
This was 11 mins ago
Im a min into the vid and i just wanted to say... please don't die lolol. you going through these origins like pizza.

Yeyyyyyy after all this time I guess this is why...your vids r always soo amazing so I guess that's why loll
okay her dying way too much is starting to get annoying now
Oh are the spots on the wall ur past lives in after life smp lol
Yay I'm early?
Why does Lizzie die so much - she has taken on so many roles and this one is the best
Her dreams came true  Became a bird , pigeon , Eagle , butterfly
Lizzie is the most hardworking youtuber ever! She tries so hard on her vids!! Keep up the good work and good content Lizzie!

I know the secret of the rooms, perhaps has something to do with your skin, and/or your origin
Lizzie Parrot is adorable.
4:18  “don’t speak to me or my son ever again”
Aw her past lives in her base
I think the decor in her room is her past origins tho I'm confused about the cow?
Omg I just got done whaching  your last episode off after life and you just posted this one lol
Lizzie being able to hide in the shadows as an enigma; really checks out with her username
omg a cute ldshadowlady parrot mythical only the parrots are allowed to see tha ldshadowlady mythical bird clap clap for being a cute parrot but been oofed by a zombie 🧟‍♂️ 😄
My god I'm early 👁️👄👁️

The way Lizzie hadn’t even been a bird for that long either 😭
Lizzie your amazing you empress me of how this happens so much
Ngl Lizzie actually low key scaring me
Omg im early for once
Yay for once you didn't die in the same episode you got a new origin (not including the birb)
This is why you don’t skip past the important safety precautions in the instructions…
AWESOME!
HAHAHAHA LIZZIE CENSORING HERSELF IS EVERYTHING I LIVE FOR
I know what it is it's all your after life origins
You’re so cute!!!!!!!❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗(but how do you keep on dying?)
Lizzie the base looks like youre decorating with your previous lives
I know she put those there those represents her origins and it's brilliant 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
i cant tell if you really just keep dying or just want to leave the server as fast as possible 💀
Am I the only one who sees the pansexuel parrot?
Can’t help but notice that the her enigma skin is a combination of all her old lives also I think the “mysterious crannies” in her base are parts of her old lives
love your vids

You should secretly follow people and stare them to death
I’m cringe :|

You did your room as your origins before!I love it 💘
lizzie you have so many deaths- you need to live a little (literally)
I know what you where doing for the decor you put all past origins

Why does Lizzie Have the cutest skins and then deis  and then turns into enigma or idk 😂😂😂
The layer was just like kingdom craft!
Hi     Oh it took me a second but the nooks are all your origins I can’t believe I didn’t notice immediately
Maybe is you get a suitable origin you should be a pirate
She has to be more careful because we only have so many lives left!
Me before 2:18 - U CAN JOIN THE TINY CLUB!  me after 2:18 - YOU CAN JOIN THE VILLAINS!
Cute!
I'm late nooo
Its sad you worked so hard for that skin then died! I'm happy you recovered!
I know the mystery the rooms and why she wanted the parrot was because of all her past orgins
Lets just hope you don't die way too fast :> bc i loooovvee this series!!!
Omg lizze! You die so quickly
How many times r u gonna die in one episode🤣
The bird life didn't last long 💀💀  Imma kill that zombie, YOU WERE SO ADORABLE AS A BIRB
Really love this video lizzieeee!!! I hope you notice my message-..............I'm a huge fan.......
Dying is lizzie's specialty!
Wow Lizzie lasted 2 minutes what a surprise 😄 Rip bird lizzie
(Forgive me if I forgot something) Lizzie literally went from a Raccoon, to a floran, then an Alien/slime thing and then a Kangaroo now a Bird to an Enigma!? Lizzie has confusing Luck, she dies a lot but gets amazing origins            -edit, The little areas in the headquarters represent the previous origins Lizzie lived as
Died in 2 mins 🫥
The house is based on all the things she has been, and the skin is sick! like fr that thing is not healthy
“WHAT THE FFMMMP- urg…. BLAZES IS THAT
Hi Lizzie 😊👋🏻
the little nucks you have in your house things you remind you of you other lifes right?
The nooks are based on her past lives I think
The rooms represents your origins
Finally Lizzie uploaded! It took ages!
Is that a bird, is that a plane?
you get the most cutest origins and you die-
I like how an episode ended with us knowing her origin finally
"you can ride other players". "can't wait" -Lizzie. "I'm so small" -Lizzie never in real life.
Omg your skin looks so cute as a parrot
Hope you don't die again Lizzie!!
I was anticipating this video, YES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I also just realised her decorations in her secret base are hinting to her old origins, how cool!
😁 YAY
Takes dedication to build a base every time you die. Well done, Lizzie!
I love how everyone takes the role of their orgins seriously and builds their personality in the game based off of it. (Spoiler warning) Like in this episode, Lizzie had a cute personality with a cute orgin of a parrot and with the enigma origin she turned into a villain that kills things.
Is it a plain,is it  a bird (well technically it is a bird) it’s a Ldshadowlady zooming through The SKY 0o0
The puzzle is all of the nooks or representing the different lives
Why is her voice soo creepy at the end ??
I stoped making my video for dis lol
"birb"-itsfunneh and krew
QUEEEN LIZZZIEEEEEE! YAYAY🤗
I have waited for so many day im so glad that you posted!!!
This secret base is making me feel like I'm watching kingdom craft again
Spoilers:        Oh my gosh an Afterlife SMP Episode from Lizzie that doesn't end in her dying? Haven't seen this since Episode 4 :') I love it P.S. I specifically mentioned end of episode since well she technically still hasn't gone an episode without dying yet since ep 4
you couldn't kill the thing as it withers you and you wither it which is uneffective
Lizzie  be like: PEACE WAS NEVER AN OPTION
Pretty sure the decorations are for her past origins
YOU'VE GONE CRAZY!!! Im so excited to see what happens!!!!
This is one of the funniest yet creepiest episodes yet!
YES 23 MINS EARLY!!!!!
OMG IM EARLY YAYAYYAYAYAY
The strange decorations are reprensations of End floran, Raccoon, Goolien, Birb
Lizzie never fail to entertain us....
hmm…. i sense the nooks are all her origins : there was her raccoon house materials.. her end floran stuff.. her goolien biome materials.. her parrot origin looks but she missed out the kangaroo origin..
Red sand in a orange place for a orange room
die parrot oh my scary lady
I know what it means it means evey ting she bicome parot racon  and more
I'm only at 10 minutes but I see what the decorations are, they are nods to you last lives
you get the most cutest origins and dies-
Yay! im a bit early!!!
Finally she doesn't lose an origin in 1 episode
honestly the funniest  episodes ever, one episode, one death
lizzie dying will always be super funny to me lol
good episode :)
The secret base is a display of all her origins
is lizzie making her house her past orgins?!
[:
Can we talk about how Lizzie's decorations represent her past lives, it's funny, sad and cute at the same xD
I missed you aaahhh
cute origin, dies, gets a creepy origin, builds an orange house, finally doesn't die in 1 episode again!
I love your videos
it's very sad how u die lizzie❤️❤️✨
she never even got to ride anyone 😥
Omg you started as a cute Bird and now you’re a psychotic serial killer like what!
LD Shadow lady pls stop dying  Your new origin is a good one pls be carefull
I like how Lizzie survived longer (by episode) in X-Life with one heart than her Origins
Lizzie if you die . I hope you dont die first and please dont die  Again again and again
EARLY!!
I've been dieing to see the next episode yay
The little hole in her new base have items that symbolize her past lives
YESSSS
Hi Lizzie I’m a massive fan (: love ur vids ur the best ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Lizzy:"The location will remain a mestery"🥸🥸 Other people:"THERS A MAP RIGHT THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!"😡😡😡😡😅😅😅😂😂
I feel like she should do a shadowcraft 3.0
Very unpredictable. I give you the crown of entertainment
I love how she was about to curse but stopped ಥ‿ಥ
Try not to die to early Lizzy ;-;
Hope she posts again soon
Amazing video!
I feel like if she becomes a villian, she'll turn down the villian club-
Your the best youtuber
OH MAH GOD SHES A PARROT- nvm shes ded
be careful you only have 4 lives
I love how we are all here to see Lizzie BASICALLY die😂😂😂 but hey, it's not like she does that on purpose
Love this smp

omg ive loved you since i was a kid so happy to see you on my recomended again!!!!!!!!!!
True very very true
Y did u not post for so long???
I'm really upset you never got to piggyback on someone. Your bird form was so pretty.
Apparently the secret is that she is building her origins head quaters
When I saw her bird colors I stared at it and then thought she’s a pansexual bird. lol
So excited just found this video :)
All of the nooks are all over her different origins
I LOVE YOUR VIDS AND A BIRD 🐦 😍
Plot twist: Lizzie is tired of cute origins and keeps dying so she can get a different origin but pretends to just be accident prone.
Every episode u have died so far
Lizzy I know your secret it is under here                        Lizzie’s secret: she has all those nooks that are decorated from her past life’s and every time she dies she will add a new one
Wow
Lizzie and Lauren should team up and form a new villain squad
Ö BIRDIE
When she dies it slaps me harder than than that guy From Men in black

Pls make more
Her carefully crafted mysterious nooks are like shrines to her past origins
The so-called "nucks" are all her past lifes like the racoon, alien, etc.
I love how Lizzie made a wall and decorated it with her past origins.
She finally uploaded!

Ok what does Lizzie has with the colors of the pan flag cuz like- First the birb skin colors And then the sock on the enigma skin is legit the flag-  Is she pan??? Am is missing something??? Or is it just me seeing pan flags everywhere cuz I'm pan???

So how many times has she died now 😂
She is going to get kicked out

The decorations are probably youre other lives
I reason was that she made a room for all her old origins 🐰
Wow such a cute origin❤❤
Only lizzie could be on her 5th life on episode 8
Lizzie is always an animal
Can you use a bow and a trident with the enigma origin?
eating chicken rn!
Ur a bird thats why
Yay Lizzie you didn’t die in the first episode 😃
I am scared
Ho
what the f- f- flazes was that? XD I love your videos!
EEEEK I KNEW SHE WAS GONNA DIE AS SOON AS SHE STARTED TO FLY
Everybody get your new skin
The secret is probably about her life’s she had I think :()
is someone keeping count of how many times she has died?
Lizzie always has to die 🤦‍♀️
If only Shelby didn’t die you guys could’ve been birb friends until you died too
I was half expecting the episode to end when the birb died
TAI LU LIZZIE STOP DIEINF 😭😭😭
I was waiting for you video to come 😭😭😭
all those nocks are for his other origins like for example the parrot is just for her parrot origin(sorry dont know how to spell nuk nock or is it nukc
i cant wait to see what will happen to enigma!lizzie omg, this is a complete new character and i wanna see what she’s gonna do next!
FINALLY, An Episode That Doesn't End With The Respawn Screen 🥳🥳😁🥳😁😁😁🥳😁🥳😁😁
Love it
EARLY its my first time ig
I’ve been watching Lizzie for many years now and every videos she posts she never lets 7s down <3
NOOOO I'm so sad 😞 I wanted to see a birb
i have a question do you die on purpose or is it just a coincidence or maybe its something spoiler or something? i would live to know
I have solve the biggest mystery in the Afterlife Smp. THE BASE OF LDSHADOWLADY. Every single corner............. IS REPRESENTING HER PREVIOUS LIFES xoxo. 😁😁😁
BRUH WHY DO U ALWAYS GET THE CUTE ORGINS
Earlyyy
Go lizzy
I immediately realized the decors were Lizzie's previous lives and that to me is adorable and sad at the same time
Lizzies new base is amazing the amount of detail
Your on a video flick!
I love ur vids lizzy!❤
Why is lizzie becoming more crazier by each episode
I think I understand what those decorations stand for
WHY IS HER SKINS ALWAYS SO CUTEEEEE!?!?!? Ekkkkkkk
The first death was sadder than when Godzilla destroyed the Disney castle in crazycraft
i just realized that the headquarters rooms are for her past lives. IM A PROBLEM SOLVING GENIUS!
I love it how Lizzie died in 2 minutes  😂
AHHHH I’m early omg omg omg
I love that the new base is all of her origins so far!
:0
Lizzie, please, you have to stop speedrunning the cute origins.
Watching this gave me so much anxiety
Lizzie through after life: raccoon -> floran -> alien -> kangaroo -> bird but then she died lol -> now she’s an enigma with cool, interesting powers😎 she’s so chill every time she gets new powers and she alrdy has an idea on what to do🙌🏻
I’m very surprised she made it through the episode alive
Guys she's still alive! We might see the enigma again next episode! Lol
I am so happy to finally see your new video  😁😄😃
Omg lizzie posted when i wasnt asleep :D also cute skin/skins! and im kinda glad the birb didnt last too long cuz it was a pretty bad origin
I love that absolutely horrifying creepy voice at the end
this episode confused the crap outta me ngl XD
Can you give me heart
Never let theme you're next move
I'm obsessed with enigma lizzie
I think I know what the nooks in Miss Mysterio (LDShadowLady's base are). Two of the nooks caught my eyes. The nooks seem to be LDShadowLady's past origins. And LDShadowLady, finally your name lives up to your origin, literally.
Hi I’m a big fan!
Hi I'm your biggest fan
plz dont die
Ur a parrot lizzie!  (Ur a wizard harry)
LIZZIE! I beg you, for the love of EVERYTHING MINECRAFT, stop DIEING EVERY EPISODE! Please 😭🤣😭
AAAA
3 life’s left
e
Did anyone else notice that each nook is decorated like her other life's?
You have made the mysterious corners because of your Origins
"Oh no my one weakness!!, being weak."
Her Home Is Clearly... Seeable to what does small crooks are (Its Her Origins If You Dont Know Racoon, Flourist, Goolien, Kangroo, Birb,
RIP LDBirbLady Ep8 0:00-2:23 And somehow not the Enigma
I like how Lizzie went from a bird to killing one
Btw if u check namemc u have 2 new skins and changd back to your normal skin
Lizzie I'm half way through your vid I feel like you should cover the map since it shows a lit up place near a rover in the south means it's near a place with a river and is explored (lit up) most likely spawn
You go girl
The pigs are out for you!!
Awesome job Lizzie!! I've been a fan for 2 yrs or so I'm the 32865 view :>
Lizzie I love your videos and I love your cute ideas! I think as an Enigma you should get revenge on Lauren for killing you because you were Joel's most prized possesion!
This is one of my favorite series and I love you ❤️ Iizzy you make the best video ever lol🫶
Thats all of your Origins, i knew that when i Saw the blue jelly thing
no not agen

She didn't die at the end of an episode for once
First lizzie never talk like that again and,2 your rooms are Origins you have had
Yeee
Lizzie has had the worst luck in this series lol
cant wait to see the mysteries that are ahead
I like that her hq kinda resembles her life in alsmp
I love how lizzie is becoming the bad guy
So... Is nobody gonna talk about lizzie almost saying the F word?🤔  Lizzie:what the f- blazes is that😳
this is deja vu on another level lol
Oh I think I get the Thame...She made each wall with hers past origins
The little nooks in your secret base are all of your past lives🥹 That is such a creative idea 💡 but, girl you need to get some protection😂

YESS I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME TYSM LIZZIE!
Birbs don’t have long life history on this server, huh?
i love how lizzie acknowledges that there was so many people trying to uncover what she was 🤣🤣❤
All the decorations is all about her origins
#10:56 she wanted to say f@ck
I think I got it the rooms was her life before she was the enigma idk
Have I watched the video yet? No. Do I believe she will last a whole episode as one origin?... I've got faith. Edit: Well- At least she ended up with a cool one in the end right?
I am not lying when I say me and my friends yelled out loud when you didn’t die 😂
Pls post the next episode soon
Yay im early for once
I would suggest making better armor and adding thorns fire protection and protection and feather falling on it for dealing damage a lava bucket and the flint and steel should help
Everything resembles her origins!
BRO ALL OF THE THINGS WHERE FOR BER PAST ORGINS THE ONE WITH A BUNCH OF PLANTS THE FLORIN AND THE READ WITH STICK RACCOON THE GOO FROM HUMANOID LIZZIE THE BOATS AND COW HEADS KANGAROOS AND THE COLORFUL PART WITH THW PARROT HEAD HER BIRB ORGIN
Oh the decorations are based of her past origins
I forgot I had superpowers - Lizzie 2022  I love your vids btw, keep up the good work! <33
The nooks in her base are actually all her old origins! :D
imagine getting a love from Lizzie!
Also do your little rooms represent all the lives  you on have that server
Ola
bye bye birdie!
you should join the villain group on the server
Is it just me or all the nooks are her past origins
the nooks are past lives lol
HOPEFULLY THIS ORIGIN LASTS ATLEAST 4 episodes
Omgggg im so earlyy
If you don’t understand, all of the “ nooks “ are representing what origin she was before she was an Enigma
LIZZIE NEEDS TO BE MORE CAREFUL
YEEEES NO DEATH CLIFFHANGER
It's all her old origins lol
I been waiting for this moment mah whole darn life soul finally
Cause you just uploaded I’m watching this in Australia and it’s midnight  Bro why am i like this
Tysm for another video tho Lizzie and taking your time of day/evening/afternoon to edit these videos and publish them for everyone to watch so tysm.
I think Lizzie might be the new villain cause Scott died and I think that is AMAZING 🤩
FINALLY!!! I’ve been waiting for FOREVER So exited to see what this one is 💜 I’ve been hoping for an avian origin it’s even a comment of mine on a previous video ^^  Edit: nvm she fricking died
how did you get the other origins that are not in the origin mod Please tell me the name
Lizzie I love you you’re my favorite YouTuber so can you please upload more you’re the best and I wish I could meet you
finally after checking lizzie’s channel everyday waiting for this video
I'm 16 mins late;-;; (I love your skin btw it looks so cutee)
Most nooks are her previous origins
I thought that you having Orange for your bace was a cool idea for no one to know it was you who made it.
FINALLY LIZZE POSTED!!! I be waiting for so long and I love her origin❤️ every time lizze dies she gets the cutest origin and I love her house, I love your vids lizze!!!🤗💛
Early!
The little nooks are her past lives ❤
Girl whatever you did to that boar was personal 😳
All the orgins Lizzie gets is so cute but dies immediately, quite fun to watch all of these orgins and the building Lizzie makes ✨
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeease don’t die
Lizzie at the start is a parrot. Then she’s an Enigma and kills a parrot.
I know what you’re doing  Lizzie
Lizzie didn’t die this time! Twice I mean!
BIRB
I have been waiting yay!!!
“What the f- blazes is that!”
i was watching your other videos and then you posted this
I think Lizzie is a bit funny as a bird😂
WHO ELS IS ANOYD THAT LIZZY CEEPS DIEING!!!!!!!!!!!😀😀😀😀😡😡
I’m really enjoying this series so please don’t end it to quickly because you are going through these lives very quickly
15MINUTES EARLY!!!!
LIZZIE HOW DO YOU DIE THIS MUCH CANT YOU LIVE FOR 2 EPISODES
I wonder if Lizzie will join the bad guys now or not 🤔
TheFlickingAmethyst She Noticed Ur Vids
Get armor the first thing you do next ep
15 minutes 😱😱
I love Lizzie's video so much because even tho she kept getting new origins, is fun to see what she can do at the time :)
I actually thought lizzie was going to die again from the pig 😭 love this series so much
I love how the title is “I can fly!” When she only did for like, 5 minutes
Was so bored and had nothing to watch and then you posted! Love you Lizzie been watching you for years 🥹🥰
I think the things lizzy built in her new headquarters are based on her  super powers
early btw lizzie put those “nooks” to represent all the things she’s been like a raccoon, or a kangaroo, and a bird.
Lizzie, we need more base invaders please 😊
This is the last origin I think
the little nooks are definitely all the origins, like the amethyst one was her alien and the red wall and black roof was her raccoon origin and bird obviously the bird one idk the others
Why does Lizzie always want to be a villain ? 😂
How many times has she died in the series?
Lizzie knows EVERYBODY SHE KNOWS
YAY LIZZIE POSTED
I love her origin
Rip birb parrot lizzie
Loved this video! (now pls stay away form death!) (:
Aahhh yess....ofc... Lizzie always find a way to be a villain in every FREAKING series....love it
"oh no, my one weakness!! Being w e a k."
SOMEONE TELL ME HOW COOL AND CUTE QUEEN LIZZIE IS????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I really love how each episode lizzie respawns in a cute origin every time
This series gives me so much life. Get it.. haha.. puns.. okay, I'm done..
I missed you so much so that's why you weren't posting some videos🤭
I understood the mysterious decorations immediately lol, they symbolize her past lives.
6:29 She's talking like Joey now? 😆😆😆
She going through too many lives...
Omg I love your new skin and your new origin. Also can’t believe you died. Almost twice.
(SPOILERS FOR THE VIDEO) Me and my sibling had made a joke since Lizzle dies so fast that her videos would get shorter and shorter until there are just 10 seconds long in 2 min she died why did the joke become a real?
I love your channel Lizzy I like that you barely even cared when you died as a bired. 😂😂
Lizzie: is evil  Also lizzie: Runs away from a pig srceeming bloody murder
'Complex mysteries.' Huh. I figures it out as soon as she pulled out the blue blocks.  I said what it is down below and if you dont want to know, don't click read more                                   Its her old houses if you didn't know.
Creepy but I love it
Honestly I thought Lizzie was streaming the episodes
birb
Hey lizzie you should upload your videos every 2 week not one month but it's good to great video
She lives left of fwips piliger base you can see it on #10:30
10:15 she is making it based on her recent lives
Wait are all the exhibits her past lives?!
Lizzie, you scared me at the end.
Nooo I have one of the birds you killed🥲😩🐣
The mysterious nooks are ur past orgins!
I was the first one to see this episode
I love it how the chat said "birb" instead of "bird" 😂
all the little nooks are decorated after all the origins she’s had so far😎🤞
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I love you lizzie❤❤❤
Please don’t die
pizzicato ls keep this origin i need lore from the enigma and you got so much potential
Scott died.. i was sad i liked villain scott but now villain lizzie exists so im happy  can we not ignore the pansexual colours on her birb skin?
I feel like the areas in the walls are the origins she died as of the times she died
Lizzie is the most best female minecraft youtuber for me she always make fun, cute and cool bulidings and things! 💗
im just so impressed by Lizzies builds like theyre always so creative and different
Another day another death 💀
JOIN. THE. VILLIANS. please
She should make a room for a "Riddle me this [Name]" for an Enigma
Love the areas, representing her previous origins
How did Lizzie, an amazing favourite youtuber of mine, give me horrifying anxiety just by watching her play minecraft. Never felt this way before...
Girl, what about the mini map? 😭
I love your new skin
Earlyyy
Let's be clear she's the first to go (no hate)
this was amazing and i love how u made ur new base, even though it makes no sense to me
enigma v cool to B)
I love that all the little nooks represent her other lives! It’s so cute
If the other server members saw you were an Enigma wouldn’t they make traps around them with mobs you can only kill with a weapon so you don’t die?
Ohhhh
10:58 Lizzie almost swear 😂😭
Loved it thx for making my day❤️
14mins ago omg slayyyy ealry
l love your videos lizzie keep up the good work
yes! lizzie posted a new video everyone!! i missed you so much💗
She’s going to to dark side. She should be part of the villain gang. Or ig head of the villain gang now.
The things are the lives she lived like when she lived in the end and when she lived my laran
Hmmmm I totally don't know why you needed a parrot 🧐
ohhh the  decor is her origins
Lizzie slayed and ate. She ate the whole plate.
the nooks are her previous lives i am a genius
Hi friends
are. you. kidding. me
Finally!! She didint die!
The decorations stands for each one of her origins
Don’t go to the Neder or the end
The secret room represents all of her past origins, there.
Lizzie your scary
Hi
You sounded the way I believe modern artist think when creating art when talking about the nooks
I love how Lizzie is fine with being dead all the time , this is the first on that’s she does not die Immediately But you are entertaining✨🌺
Can we appreciate how Lizzie puts so much effort to make us happy
It’s 12am but I have to watch this, good job on the video Lizzie!
Please dont die again lizzie see you next time and keep up the good work I love you!!!!
I love the fact that the little spots are different origins she has lived for
I cannot believe she died already
EARLY HIII IM SO EXCITED AAAAAAAAAA
the little nooks are based off all your old origins
Ooh
Whenever Lizzie uploads my day is literally perfect ♥️♥️
Lizzie you should get a player head to make everything more sinister.
hope next episode she doesn't die
Oh my freaking gosh. I clicked on the video and said “oh lizzie please dont die”, 2:18 into the video, bam! Death after being a really good origin. Amazing video!! Id love to see after life season 2, as well as kingdom craft, onelife, and xlife season 2
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 amazing
YAY
Since Scott died, I think Lauren might become the leader of the Villain Club ( unless Angel Scott is some kind of evil angel ) And As an Enigma, maybe you should try to join it!
I think lizzie is going a little insane arter getting all new origins 🤣
The Enigma is probably the most ominous Origin Lizzie has ever gotten so far. Is this a call for a villain arc?
I KNOW WHAT THE WALLS MEAN THEYRE ALL HER PAST ORIGINS
She spent 2:14 minutes as a birb
I like how she is funny,pretty,smart,fashion girl.
I feel like Lizzie is a klutz you know a clumsy person
Oh also love your vids
what kind of horror movie am i watching here
I understand your detour
The voice that she made at the end sinister
The decorations in your base was your past lives houses and habitats(?) I think
Will you form your own league since the league of villains keep killing  you
ALL OF THE DOCOR REPRESENTS YOUR DIFFERENT LIVES IN THE SERVER
I figured out what was the decorations for the second i saw them
10:09. IF U WERE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE NOOKS AND CRANNYS, SHE HAS A AREA FOR EVERY ORAGIN SHE WAS !
i was thinking could she use a bow?
I don’t know if it’s just me but it seems Lizzy is becoming evil 😱
SHE DIDNT DIE AS AN ENIGMA
I thought u were a flamingo-
birb didnt even get hous :(
Took me way too long to figure out that the nooks were an homage to all her other origins lol
Lizzie:these nucks are very mysterious  Me:the flower nuck represents your life as a floran and all your other nucks represent your other lives
The second one relly douse mach the name shadow lady
She’s ALIVE!!!
One of the first epesodes she lasted a epesode I guess?
Are all your home decorations based around your previous origins??
I genuinely love the Enigma origin so far, although I really was curious to see how far Lizzie could go as a Birb. Here's to hoping she doesn't die next episode, please T__T
Still died but the other origin will hopefully last the next episode
Lizzie always get cute orgains and then dies :,) btw i love your vids!
Evil Lizzie.. I LOVE IT
I think you made it to were every corner is your past life. I love your videos
I feel bad For lizzie actually- LIKE She dies IN EVERY EPISODE-
THAT WAS JOEL'S HOLE - AH MY MIND IS SO UNTIDY😭✌️
Lizzie has turned Goth mode
I think I love this every time she dies all off the cute origins will be lizzie's love it 😍😊😘❤️💗
I got it! I think the decore is based off her past oragens! ( can't spell lol)
I understand what the nooks for they are all of her past lives me Big brain hehe
her mysterious outro lowkey gave me chills. cant wait to see your villain arc
Love your vids keep doing them
All of the decorations are lizzie's past origins
*i just wanted to say hi!*
Thank God lizzie could make it this episode
Lizzie's luck is so bad, I feel bad for her
Pls survive this time
THE NOOKS ARE YOUR PAST LIFESSSSS
THE NOOKS OR WHATEVER IS ALL OF YOUR LIVES!!!
Another villain after we lost one enjoy it while it lasts lizzie and those nooks and crannies are amazing to represent your past origins
I love Lizzie video so much!! Her videos makes me smile 😋😋
I love the new base and all the different things representing all her previous origins🥺💕
OMGGG 13 MINUTES AGOOOOOOOO -DKAJFNSBN
The house is decorated to look like all your past lives
Finally an episode that keeps Lizzie alive
Waw
Hiii!!
Love the creepy voice lol
For the first time I actually was scared for Lizzie… I’m realising how many deaths she’s come close too
Lizzie… your voice at the end was very villainous 😈
I think those nooks you had represent the diffrent origins you've had    Also your builds are  so good and cute! Keep going!
When she says it’s a mystery it’s actually all the mobs she has been
Im very surprised she survived from that pig cuz I know for a fact she would die-
Lizzie always gets the perfect Origins that match her aesthetic! 💕
Yes its while since she hasn’t died at the end of the episode
Omg it all went so fast lol
How do u keep dying miss gal😭
Even though Lizzie dies pretty often I actually like being able to see her play different origins
Oh,she...she turned into a...a.. psyco😱😱😱
it’s her old origins lol
And the enigma stays on 👏
What the f—- blazes is that?? Lol I laughed so hard 10:57
Love the new base!✨
Ooooh VILLAIN Lizzie since scott just died thats perfect
The nooks are her previous lives
Finally! Her origin survives more than 1 video
Finally one episode that she didn't die !
Lizzie: Here is my top secret headquarters! The location of which will remain a mystery! Me: looks at map in Corner… 😭🤣

12 MIN I LOVE THISSDDSSS
Wow… I didn’t expect lizzie to die within the first 2 minutes of this video😂
I love how Lizzie said oh no my biggest weakness being weak😭
Were the hobbits all your origins so far
The decorations were from your life’s
"Oh no! My one weakness, being weak! " ✋💀
Try to kill the ender dragon
LOVE 💕
Okay for real though, lets appreciate the fact that her videos are so good that I click on her playlist and watch kingdom crafts and the others and I have watched them all at least 6 times ! Luv you and Joel Lizzie , keep up the amazing work, would seriously die without these videos popping up on my home screen and notifications <3
Her nooks in her secret basecret base are her old lives there's the raccoon the parrot the ender Florin and kangaroo
6 min late yet I forgot to comment
The mystery of your house is... It is that those are all your before origins you had
Thanks for Calling me Your Fan 7:22 I Can't Actually Breath !!!!😭😭

i was just wondering if you were going to upload soon! you're videos always make my day (its 12am for me rn lol)
Pls dont die again im still watching the introo
Im dutch so i think im suposte to like that orange
I think the “mysterious decorations” are little excerpts from her past lives Teh slime one: Alien life The bee one: Florián life Spruce tree one: raccoon life Parrot one: very shirt birb life The cow one: what
“what the f- …blazes is that!?!?”
I just love how lizzies thumbnail looks like and the video was so cool 😎 and I will definitely recommend this video to my freinds

I think it's designed after all the origins Lizzie has gotten
Barracuda sounds like the pokemon barrasweda. Lizzie im sorry a pokemon like creature attacked u
The nooks represent all her origin's 😎
11 mins ago Me: ah inner peace
Lizzie gets hit by boar:what the f—-…. Blazes is that 😭😭
Lol

Hi

I know why there's the little rooms: it's all her previous origins 🧐
Stop dieing. Please
9:01 has the same energy as the first episode of the Owl House. "Mu only weakness, dying!"
Lizzy survived almost just she needs to be less daring
SHES MERGED WITH GRIAN!!! SOMEONE STOP HER!!!

hello love you Lizzie
Congratulations to lizzie you lasted an episode with the enigma origin
Oml 😂
Those little nooks were all the lifes she was/had
My parrot queen😄 🦜

The nooks in her secret base represent her previous origins!
The decorations depends on her life in afterlife
Each section represents one of your last lives. Don’t they?
The decorations is her origins
Braugh Lizzy how do you keep on dying you cant survive an episode anymore since you died in the end as a raccoon. Please survive at least 2 episodes as an Enigma. Pretty please
Omg Lizzie the parrot skin is sooo cute
Each of those areas look like they represent a life she had
I cant believe lizzie died after like 3 minutes of being a parrot 😭😭 I have a bad feeling she’ll die again soon 💔
still can't believe lizzie has died more times then jimmy, it's impresive
Are the decorations all your different origins?
are the nooks lizzie’s previous origins 😭😭
I'm impressed you survived one video in 1 origin
YESSSSS FINALLY AN NEW EPISODE 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😆😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😄😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁

Hi Lizzie your content is great
If some people don’t know what it is I can tell y’all that it is her previous life‘s
Villain lizzie is very needed in every series 😎💖  Now we have The Villainess Enigma ✨
The nooks are her other lives
So mysterious. Changing her skin to confuse us! Love you Lizzie 💕💕
I thought you were a parrot
I think you decorated you nucks of your old origins
That was... Not unexpected of Lizzie- the death I mean. She is definitely first in the competition for who leaves the server first😅
lizzie i have a question, it's about your sexuality if you don't mind me asking, the color scheme of your skins have the pansexual flag in correct order, is this a coincidence or are you pan? 🤔
Whenever u post it make me happy! I have be watching for years
The secret headquarters are theme of her life
Best afterlife speed runner?!
I panic everytime Lizzie's get attacked by something 😭
Ya know Lizzie im really nervous because i think you might die again
Lizzie, once again, has retreated back, to her villain.. *origin*
omg ur back I was waiting for you😊
I love your vids and I'm impressed how much work you put in
Not Lizzie building each one of her lives
Omgggggggg
I love how her nooks are her old biomes she's made✋
All the nooks are lizzies past origins!!💕💕💕
The nooks are basted off of your past lives
I love the new origin so cute. It must be nice to be able to fly!
im  Love your veds Lizzie
I love your videos so much
I think we can all agree Lizzie is gonna be the first on the server to get through her lives haha
Is it me or all the holes in her place it looks like all the origin that she has been before a enigma
FINALLY
10:05 these ‘mysteries’ are her past bases thats so cuteee

Ilyyy
I've been waiting for soooooo long.
Is it only me or does Lizzie die so often in this series😵
Can we just appreciate her  new outfit
WOW
Lizzie’s life as a parrot was so cute yet short lived
I love your new origin
I'm so nervous if Lizzie is the 1st one who will kicked out of the server 😨
Hi Lizzie I’m a fan I love ur vids
I’m still thoroughly convinced that she’s going to be the first to get kicked out of the server and use up all of her lives.
Hi
OMG say to a §enemy let’s §do a eye staring competition and then they die
Well, she made it to the desert....
I was here
I love how she got revenge on Lauren last episode and it’s funny how she died because of a barracuda LOL
First : The void Second: The Void Third: Lizzie marriage betrayed her Fourth: “ Barracuda” And fifth: The undead and now the mystery continues
I LOVE THIS!!p.s I liked and subscribed:)ooh and shared!
s-she died again..
Here before 1m
Ok so I liked her first one but the second one is really cool also does anyone know what life she’s on?
GURL WTF
7:24 Amethyst my boy Amethyst!!!!
SO COOOOOL ive loved this since she was a racoon :D
lizzie looked like the pansexual flag as a birb
I don’t think she will last long on this server :|
Ok but The effort,it's not just a video you put funny things and lots of effort and your always sure the other enjoy the video and I knew it your a parrot 🦜✨✨

todays my birthday amazing way to start my day!
Honestly that bird life shouldn’t count for one of your lives bc it was a glitch in the server. You should still have 4 lives left.
At least you didn't end the episode when you died! Haha
EARLY
Love your new enigma life
2 origins in 1 video. Proof LDShadowlady is the queen of death
ALREADY 1K COMMENTS IN 1 MINUTE WOW

I love it how she dies
4 mins ago
“You Can ride other players”   DIRTY MIND DIRTY MIND
I COULDN'T BELIEVE SHE DIED AGAIN 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ldshadowlady never fails to bring a smile on our faces!!  (Literally 2 minutes into the video she has died..) R.I.P Also, are the mysterious” things in your base your past origins? The hunny blocks were your florin origins, geod blocks and blue slimes were your goolien orgin, the small red wall were the racoon origin house.
I came here immediately
I live in Australia so that’s offensive
Why am I not surprised about the fact that lizzie died again literally 2 mins after she got her new orgin 😂
I love ur new skin tho!
two origins in one episode feels like both a blessing and a curse ✋
Can we just appreciate how she spends here time making amazing videos just for are entertainment
Please survive longer this time
Oh no!!! Lizzie you died again..
Will I ever see LDshadowlady not die in a new episode??
We love these cute orgins😭
That’s really offensive
This is very concerning
I am in love with this series!!
Sweet 3 minuets! Also why does she keep dying I- it’s gonna be a ride how many times as she died now?
Is,anyone else extremely scared that she’ll get kicked because she lost all of her lives?
LIZZIE I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!!!!!!! YOU POST ALL THE TIME AND ITS SO HELPFUL TO KEEP UP WITH
Yesss😂

Born, only to then die
LDShadowLady, a bird who fell in a hole, died from a zombie upon falling down a hole. a bird.
You managed to stay alive for 2 whole minutes 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The video was posted 3mins ago fir me
Lizzie while reading the cons of her origin: "Yep this seems unimportant!"  *Foreshadowing
also hi
Lizzie you posted this too late people are making theories about you now 😮
STOP I WASNT EXPECTING A DEATH SO SOON IN THE EPISODE??
Seeing how many lives lizzie has left is scaring me I dont want this to end
That’s why you changed skins
earlyyy
You should live in the walls of other peoples houses for the enigma
HII OMFG EARLY
I have a feeling lizzie is gonna be the first one to be eliminated in this series
So excited for this episode !!
Omg nooooo 😭 your life as birb would have been so beautiful
Thank you so much for being a YouTuber! These really make my day
Ive been watching u ever since i was in 4th grade and now im almost in highschool! Love ur videos lizzie <3

I liked the birb
Birb lizzie gone and now it's enigma lizzie try slow down with deaths
Am i the first or i don't know but nice video
SPOILERS      I was not ready for her to die less than 3 minutes in, truly a Lizzie move.
I love how she was so happy to be a bird/birb and then died
I am watching this 2 min. after the upload
Have to go watch the last video because i missed it but then i will come back and watch this one!
I’m the 2 person to view!

I literally checked back on her videos every 5 minutes, then this came out, lol

Lizzie was so excited to be a bird only to die in a cave lol
I know why the smp is called afterlife now cuz Lizzie goes to the afterlife every video

Since it’s a known fact that Lizzie can’t keep her animals alive, it makes sense that she dies everytime that she’s an animal in this series
