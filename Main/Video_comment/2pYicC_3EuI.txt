I’ve definitely been the friend to go distract the bride and groom on the dance floor while one of their friends was throwing up in the bathroom with like 3 people  helping her. They never had a clue.
I love that they are the same person with gender being literally the only difference
Penelope had the best bedside manner is what he’s talking about. She showed up, took care of business then swiftly left.  Pretty much what most people want
josh repeating “I need a jägerbomb” when everyone was talking over each other was quite possibly the realest part pf this episode
Not that girl throwing up white power. 🫤
wow she seems obnoxious....
Josh is not beating the millennial allegations
You all are amazing people this video was so much fun I'm wishing you all the luck in the world that you get exactly what you want for your wedding days ahead .
that's like $44,000 in catering not counting the alcohol
wait my boyfriend josh is married?
Instead of wasting money on an expensive wedding use that money for a down payment on a house.
Yo!!! When he busted out the jerk mid dance I ALMOST DIED!!!!! 😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣
You joked about eloping to the Taco Bell Cantina but I have a friend that got married there and they are the happiest and most stable couple I think I've ever known. 🤣
💟🔥
Dance to the post modern jukebox version of creep.  Sung by Haley Reinhart.    Hopefully this isn't to late for the date.
I like seeing other people's nice lives. I hope they all are actually happy.
This is a year late so I may have missed my moment. If these two are still under the fiancé label,  I'm officially throwing my hat in the ring to film their wedding! If interested just let me know, and I can send over my reel!
1:50 that hand hanging in the background is so painful
I need an extended period of tranquil silence after watching this
Both the Bachelor and Bachelorette parties should happen at Buffalo Wild Wings. On the same night, but in separate corners of the restaurant.
Mythical kitchen should cater their wedding!
Why doesn’t your bosses pay for it as your wedding present 😂
What happened?
♥♥♥♥♥♥
Julia is a babe. i am jealous. hah
“How do arms work” is the most relatable line ever
I would have just hired my favorite food truck chefs lol.
i want to attend the wedding but i don't want it to be a show 0f the wedding. snippiuts please
Penelope is awesome😂😂😂😂😂
She is so pale but cute
I've never seen a more perfect couple...
You realize "fiancé " means a man, the feminine form is fiancée.
well the wedding happened and we need to know the menu know !! please
you might be able to hire a couple food trucks that with your diverse food needs.
Jager is the only alcohol that has ever made me sick lol
SAFRICAN?! Awesome! Defo have the pap en chakalaka! I'll have to go check if you guys are married yet!
These two have been engaged forever
Gosh, Josh and Julia are soulmates! This video is superb!! What an awesome idea and props to Julia for doing it! Josh dislikes human touch as he has said in videos, yet keeps putting his arm around his Love 🥰
Nicole’s feature is perfect
They are the same. Person. This is so wonderful
Do it. Make a production with all your friends and family. Yolo.❤
Y'alls production is like HeeHaw in the kitchen.
theyre the same person fr
It’s “fiancée”, not “fiancé” 😊
I've played enough Assassin's Creed to know that Julia is DEFINITELY a Templar spy.
one josh was enough now theirs a female version of him
Whats the deal errybody? They still together? Still getting married? Found anither catering company yet?
Josh. It's been awhile since I've pumped out 100+ servings of whatever but I would've felt honored to be part of your custom catering staff.
This is maybe the most stressed I've ever been watching a YouTube video.
You all need a Monica Gellar as the caterer
The solution might be food truck court outside the venue.  Mythicon 2 could be wedding themed. Come back to Austin.
Hear me out: If you wanna go this all out with the food, hire 3-4 culinary school grads/students for a few weeks, meet with them a time or two before the wedding to run over the menu with them beforehand and like work with them to teach them the menu/timings of dishes. Occasionally we'll have the hook up for renting industrial kitchen space and more unique ingredients (depending heavily on the location of the event).
💚💚💚💚💚  amazing  couple!    wanting the other happier than you are.=.both happy.  boom!    married super happy 20 yrs til he passed. doing that 💚💚💚
8:40 I think Josh just channeled his inner bird with this one. It looks like a mating dance from a National Geographic documentary.
They are so f****ing perfect for each other 😤😤😤😤😤
Didn’t they break up  Kinda weird this video is still up
Congrats Ya'll !!
Someone please call Kitchen Nightmares 💩🎭
As someone who's suffered through several weekends in Nashville, the bachelorette line was SPOT ON. 😂😂 I was once nearly run over by a bachelorette party on scooters in downtown Nashville...
Just split the menu and hire two different catering services lol
She said frank senatra and my mind went straight to fly me to the moon
for a menu that god damn big you need 3 catering companies MINIMUM
MSG is garbage. Why would you add that to your food when people go out of their way to look for food that has no MSG in it?
Interview Chappell roan ❤
Interview Chappell roan ❤
Loved the Nicole cameo 😂
i wanna come to the wedding lol
Maybe I’m missing something, but…   …I’m < 4 minutes in and the way that he treats her like he knows more about food than she’ll ever know about anything kinda grosses me out. Like, I’m done with this video and I’m no longer a fan of his.
the farther into the episode, the more Josh's hair started to look like spider legs to me
Her reassurance is so cute
Wedding theme: Saucy Carrots Color scheme: burnt orange, cream or gold, dark browns, and maybe a pop of green Time of year: fall Cake flavor: carrot cake, cream cheese or vanilla frosting, caramel sauce Additional dessert: dirt cups Bouquet: bundle of carrots, obviously That should get you started 😉
You should have your wedding at dickies playground in Fresno california.  Or anywhere on modock street in south fresno california
You should invite her to eat her last meal.
The slow dance devolving into Josh doing his own weird dance had me in tears hahaha
The list of dishes they sent to the first caterer was unhinged.
I would want to Marry Julia too. Adorable. Congrats You two!!  <3 Mucho Love
I don't know what to comment
I make AMAZING mixed drinks and jello shots fly me out from michigan and ill make all the drinks free of charge
Its crazy seeing how chaotic Nicole has become, i remember when she first started she was very serious and timid. Lol
Baja California is absolutely stacked, all these foods came from there: Tacos Gobernador, Baja Med, Margaritas, Cesar Salad, Quesabirria, Mexican style Ceviche you have Ensenada, Los Cabos, Tijuana and the traditional Chinese population in Mexicali, the oldest one in Mexico, part of the titanic was filmed in Baja as well.
Mozel tov
C'mon guys... the 1st dance song has to be "Killing in the name of" by Rage Against The Machine
MSG is great! Uncle Roger approves!
I'm stresseed...
Ask Lilly she is the best chef on your show.
That oxo spat is incredible, I use mine almost daily. Also your future wife is gorgeous, so are you... Congratulations to the both of ya!
they are so so perfect for  each other love them
I've been  watching  you for year's 😮 and this is what you settled for😮😢😢😢
8:30 omg Sail Away by Styx would be amazing for that kind of vibe.
Merry Weddingmas!
Julia and Josh are literally the same person.
Josh and Julia are such a cute couple. its adorable how perfect they are for each other
FLLYYYMEATHUHMOON
Creep by Radiohead is actually wild
This is fantastic! BAHAHAHAHA!!!! Also, my friends got married at the Taco Bell Cantina in Vegas!!!!!!
You heard it from the man, himself; Marines are blackbelts.
Lilly abd V are really giving on molly vibes
Tbh, if they found a bunch of food trucks willing to do a few of each thing they want, this is very doable! South African truck for piri piri, mexican for quesadillas, etc. Get a venue with a big parking lot (pretty easy for cali) and you're set.
Respectfully, Julia is cute <3
Dont mention Wedding when youre shopping vendors. They jack up the prices
A very clearly Asian woman yelling "I'VE NEVER HAD A QUINCEÑERA" is peak chaos . . . and had me rolling
Grab a couple of friends and go to city hall. Then rent out a picnic area & grill out.
Man I just wish you both the best, you bring us so much joy and I just want the same back for you.
As Gordon Ramsay’s seventh kid, I’m sure he’d cater the wedding lol
It's gonna be real disappointing when Josh stabs her in the third game for no narrative reason.
Josh barely able to cook is hilarious. Could see it before they said he couldn’t multitask. Hilarious 😂😂😂
I'm not attracted to guys but -  THIS BIG HUNKING DELISH meatloaf who's a $99 version of Jack Reacher (the beefcake guy, not Tom Cruise version Reacher) and cooks and is funny as hell and makes last meals with all kinds of famous people?  I'm fking jealous of Julia.
The wedding co-ordinator....too damn funny 🤣🤣🤣
In my wedding we had two whole cows, seven whole lamb, 200 chickens, And that’s before slaughter we did a barbecue thing
I raise 100% puréed Wagyu with Japanese blood with paperwork. You give me a wedding invite. I’ll donate a cow to you.
A great friend of mine is an awesome wedding coordinator in the LA area 👀
Josh has said on multiple occasions that he doesn't like physical contact, but it was nice to see how he wanted to touch/hold Julia whenever he got a chance.
I think the mythical kitchen needs to come together and cater a wedding LMAO.
I cannot understand how Julia sounds more like Rosanna Pansino than Rosanna Pansino does
The crazed look in Josh's eyes when he says "Fly me to to moon" is killing me😂😂
Ask Ramsey to do it....bet he would
i watched this episode & got engaged that night LMAO i love everything about iosh and julia and mythical kitchen
How many Mythical chefs have you created? Find Mythical chefs that can handle the dishes and other support people willing to cook in a kitchen that you rent. This could even be an opportunity to even test for a new restaurant/catering service.
Roasted Carrots inspired by Nightshade... Are you trying to kill all of the vegetarians?
As someone who eloped to the Taco Bell cantina. Cannot recommend enough
Not sure what direction you want to go in with your wedding, but I have seen a very relaxed wedding before where a bunch of food trucks were in a U-shaped around the tables and dance floor. It’d be a great opportunity to get the mix of flavors that you want on a budget while keeping a lax, modern atmosphere
If we don't get at least a highlight reel from your wedding, the world will a poorer place.  If would love to see your wedding (at least as much of it as you would want to share) because I don't think I have seen two people more suited for each other in a very long time.
Nicole absolutely cracked me up! She would make an epic wedding planner
I hope you guys have the wedding of your dreams but I always recommend, save the wedding debt and take all that money and either throw it on a house or have a badass honeymoon.
No wonder all the catering places sead no😂.
Mythical is just full of adorable couples. What if they just had a bunch of food trucks at the wedding? That would be a dope ass wedding.
POUGHKEEPSIE MENTIONED🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just honestly want to know if Josh is always pure chaos 😂😂😂😂
Josh has changed his look?
u should ask the next season of masterchef and make it a team mission lol
Potluck wedding is a good idea.
I gave myself 2 years to plan my own wedding. Picked the date and no rush. I agree with everyone to HIRE A PLANNER.
shut up you guys are actually adorable together congrats and good luck 🤞
This is a perfect example of  when two Golden Retrievers marry each other.
I've done small floral projects, took Floristry courses, and made the flowers for my friend's and sister's wedding If your in LA, go visit the LA flower market, give yourself an idea on the floral aspect of your wedding. Also, if you want to find out prices and see flowers you may not know exist. If saucy carrot is what your looking for, look into maybe some orange, brown(the saucy part), red, purple, and white(other colors carrots could be) with leatherfern. Additionally there are centerpieces people have made with glass vases and jars where they put carrots in them and had flowers coming out("carrot bouquets" is what I googled). No matter what you do, have fun with it, and worst case scenario, go with white as the accent color(it goes well with literally everything).
With as many different things as you want, you should somehow see if you can be a challenge on Top Chef...
Get Nicole her EGOT
My team of cooks and I would love to take on the menu. We're all classically trained and work in the New York fine dining scene. Food festival style would make it really fun and very interesting. We'd be honored to make that dream menu a reality!
I would unironically plan their wedding for free cause I think it’s fun and they seem like fun people to plan for 😂😂
You should consider food trucks for the wedding. It's pretty popular now and that would allow you to have all the different foods and would fit your fair vibes. Good luck 🎉
Their wedding menu isn't actually that crazy, but it may require getting multiple catering sources. Definitely more of a budget issue than anything else.
You two are just too cute and complement each other wonderfully
that wedding menu is absolutely insane lol!
I need to hear this version of toxicity
can I get an invite to the wedding once you find a caterer that will make all of that?!
mythical kitchen should cater the wedding and live stream the shenanigans in the kitchen
Josh looks like Patrick Wilson
How does Josh get the entire Madison square Garden in every meal
julia sounds exactly like rosanna pansino, i was trying to figure it out the whole video.
Why not just elope and get away from it all? Do you own thing without all the nonsense. Go right to the  Honeymoon. :)
They should have all of the food concoctions that won throughout the series
Mythical kitchen wedding sounds like an awesome idea. As does piri piri chicken!
I don't know what to comment
Just do IT !!!! :D
I came for the chaos and left very satisfied :) I love the fod truck idea for your wedding ... BUT Hear me out Have Hells Kitchen cook for your wedding :)
Out door beach weddings are nice and not expensive. You could have two signature drinks. One that represents the bride and one that represents the groom.
“God I hope that swamp creature never comes back!” 🤣 that absolutely sent me
You guys going to Sick New World?  Slipknot and System of a Down are co-headlining I hear.
Not the Saltburn reference! 🤢
What if the Mythical Kitchen crew caters Josh and Sarah's wedding as a gift?
Genuinely such a beautiful couple in every way. So happy for them both 🥲 I’d pay a crazy amount of money to attend their wedding, just to experience the energy would be crazy.  Also, unironically I KNOW that Nicole would be an insanely good wedding planner/logistics on the day person.   Also if any shy Jewish girl around 18-22 wants a nice shy Jewish boy just reply to this comment hahaha 🙃😭
Lily 😂
I’d use my catering company to make every last thing they want for their want 626 night market style HMU!
Julia is so heartwarmingly supportive of Josh when he lets his intrusive thoughts take over 😂
You said she's (lilly) having her quincinera? That means she just turned 15. Probably not the best that she's drunk, unless she's so drunk that she just thinks its her quincinera
Mythical kitchen wedding Catering looks like its off to a great start 😂
lily has become josh's kryptonite of weirdness
Vi's outfit was sooo cute though, as always the flower girl steals the show
Since you're friends with Gordon now, you should talk to him about having the  Hell's Kitchen Show cater it and have Gordon film the back of house for broadcast TV.
not me screaming to please not put the thing back in the blender after josh made out with it
"thats so good" "make out with me" 😂
Imma be honest I don't think the 50M wedding that girl had at Versailles or whatever had so many courses lol I think the only way to get close would be maybe to do like: cocktail hour: raw bar, mezze spread, then a plated or family style dinner w/ like the salad and soup, and some of the mains and sides (since none of those things are fun to eat festival style), and then get a taco guy with one of those flat top grills to come for the Kiss Goodnight/late night. But yeah most caterers kind of have their own menus and things so may be difficult to find someone to do custom
Maybe ask some other YouTubers who cook if they want to cook for your wedding.
Don’t quinceañeras happen when the girl is like 13? Or 15? It’s one of those. The drunk quinceañera girl has some problems.
You need to be mic’d up at your wedding because that audio will be hilarious
Not cooking scrambled eggs on high. You. Are. Insane. 🤣
Have you considered contacting Gordon Ramsay's agents or MasterChef's producers about having MasterChef cater your wedding as part of a team challenge? I feel like that's the level of intensity you need.
I find it funny that this came out on my anniversary, and my wife also couldn't figure out the arm cross thing.
2 words.  -Beach wedding  -Vegas wedding
I didn't know they were Jewish
Imagine Gordon Ramsey actually making the entire list of foods they mentioned and throwing in just ONE grilled cheese sandwich just for Josh as a reminder of how their friendship started 😂😂 And to top it off a GMM inspired cake decorated with his signature pieces of bread on each side for an idiot sandwich 😂😂. And of course helping create Josh's signature drink. That would be epic!
Lily’s always the drunk person😂
Nicole's character gave me Princess Carolyn from Bojack Horseman and Jennifer Barkley from parks and rec vibes, which I loved
I can't be the only one that dislikes josh's hair this way D:
Yeah LOL Love you guys but I would have turned down that menu too
Imagine the takeaway from your big international trip being Nando’s
I can't give you a whole wedding but I'd absolutely be down to donate!
More Penelope!
Do it Pennsylvania style. Have the wedding outside in November, near a questionable lake that's only a lake during rain. Have the reception at a fire hall. Food will be buffet style, some random meat, maybe a fish. Music can be a DJ that only has songs from the last middle school dance. Don't forget, at the end of the night, people need to help clean up. Put the tables and chairs back, and sweep the floor, or we ain't getting our deposit back!
Why can I see them just hiring a bunch of food trucks for their wedding that line around the reception area and guests just mill around to get food. If I lived in SoCal I would 100% find myself doing that
wow she could totally beat josh in a fight
They should ask Tini to cook their wedding meals
Mythical kitchen should cater the wedding. Trevor does cake
We did a $100000 wedding for $10000 doing everything ourselves. Soooo much work.
Youre the same persons. Peoples....whatever. so much scatter.
saucy carrots 😭so cuuuute
Okay so I'll let you know after the video if my wife and I APPROVE of your fiance, Josh... Why does she seem more comfortable on camera than you do in this lol? Who is your fiance and what does she do?
What cracks me up is, on a daily basis, Josh IS chaos! So I don’t think any amount of crazy interference can throw him off his game!
My managers cater canceled 2 days before his wedding and he ended up getting red robin
Make it a YouTube wedding. Seriously, turn the wedding staff into a who's who of YouTube content creators. YouTube is full to bursting with cooks, and musicians, and arts and crafters, even party planners, and every one of them can work a camera too so you don't have to worry about a photographer either. Turn the whole wedding into 'what would happen if all these folks put their heads together on something. Heck you can even work with a couple of efficiency planners on the platform to help you get through the stuff you are being indecisive about. When it's all done, you have a special "YouTube Edit" of the wedding video and split the proceeds from the views with all the providers who contributed.
Big Holly and Michael Scott vibes 😂❤
This gives me split feelings.  On the one hand I'm jealous and happy for you that you've found love and something that is real for you.  On the other I'm so relieved I'm single.  You guys stress me out.
Jim Morrison is my family from NO go to drink. Root beer with Jagar.
Can k come to the wedding just to eat lol
Strong Jewish couple right there ❤❤
This is the same energy as two golden retrievers in a ball pit
You should do your reception outside and do a bunch of food trucks. You should be able to find different food trucks that’ll do the stuff on your list. That way you have a variety for your guests, it’s all meaningful, still in the wheel house for each chef, and gives the festive vibe.
I like how Julia throws the “OK” sign right at the beginning.  The universal sign for made you look, I’m going to punch you in the arm now. Don’t let the WP people take circle game!!! 😂
Just have the the mythical crew do a whole video series on catering joshes wedding and put it on the books
Nicole is so annoying
OMG LILLY😂😂😂
Dear god.....there's no calm one.
Thumbnail is so cute
I'm loving Josh's hairstyle lately!
Really? Gordon didn’t hook y’all up with a set of Hexclad?
As someone who has been engaged since 2019 - I related to this whole thing so much.
Okay Josh I'm going to be a mench here... You should have Trevor make the wedding cake... It needs to be filmed... Monetized... And the proceeds goes to the wedding or The honeymoon. BOOM *Drop the mic*... Nicole can help and that would be a mitzvah! 😂
You know there are (at least) DOZENS of mythical beasts out here who have enough culinary skill to cater your wedding to spec right?
When two ADHDers end up together in perfect chaotic harmony 😂😂
You know it's serious because Josh is wearing pleated pants.
My favorite part of this episode: 20:44 Josh: Didn't I make shrimp quesadillas like a week and a half ago? Julia: Wasn't that yesterday? No one even bats an eye.  I love it!  They were meant for each other.  The J&J Wedding will be amazing and I hope you share a lifetime "and a half" of happiness together!  At the same time, I'm legit curious - with how different their scales of time were, which answer was correct?  Or was it neither?  lol!
Vianai as Daisy with the daisies in her space bun haha!
I thought this was going to be sappy, but I should have known better 😂 Of course Josh and all the Mythical Kitcheneers would make it a silly skit too
What this is teaching me about weddings is not to have one.  City Hall, then cook a feast at home for the friends and fam.
They should hire a bunch of food trucks
These mfs are NOT marrying each other lmfaooooo
That editing for the menu is kinda deceiving. They listed out the whole thing, but edited it as if they were leaving a lot of things off. Honestly it probably would have been faster if they had just not edited that part at all
I promise I watched the whole thing and went back several times. I have no idea when the food happened, it kinda magically appeared at the end. Cuteness overload followed by pure chaos and crowned with three delicious dishes. I love it.
Have you considered.. having food trucks just a slew of them at your wedding lol
I'm a wedding planner based in Philly and I'd love to help you plan your wedding
Why use msg when it's toxic? Food is good enough without it.
Josh’s hair is giving Dandy Mott from AHS Freak show… so sorry to point this out king but I can’t stop thinking it
Holy potatoes! Josh, you're marrying way above your league;) your fiance is stunning
cute
It would be nice to find a girl to get married with. P.S. I'm Single
best part was the 10000 steps
Help
One thing you guys could do is just have around five food trucks.  Then you can make it like a festival.
Jon's wedding tips #1 - Figure out WHERE you want to get married before you decide WHEN to get married
It's amazing how un-funny all the interruptions were. Stick to cooking, please. Comedy isn't your forte, ladies.
It's sounding a little like a last meal for relationships. Weddings are a start of something, not an end. Saucy carrots and chicken skewers are great, but maybe try to think of the foods that you want to make special moving forward; what do you want to cook in decades to come that you can say, "This was on our wedding menu." And that's is what makes it special, instead of some other story and oh yeah we had it at our wedding also. As far as wedding planning in general, I think most people can agree couples are doing too much. Instead of wild themed weddings just have a wedding about your commitment and uniting your families then go ahead and have awesome anniversary parties down the line. Over the top weddings have a feeling of this is it, but you really don't want the climax of your relationship to be day one.
As an ex military chef who has cooked for squaddies in the UK I would relish a chance lime this to cook wacky and non traditional food.
Make it a mythical wedding and have Rhett & Link foot the bill...problem solved!!!
You guys don't need the help just some advice!  You guys have a vision of an epic wedding!  So my advice try to get food trucks to cater.  This way you have your festival of food at your wedding! Don't let anyone tell you how you two want your wedding it's your wedding for crying out loud not theirs.
So glad to see that Julia seems to match Josh's energy, or at least tries lol
what if josh catches the bouquet at his own wedding
Shots everytime they call each other baby ❤😊
Josh put a wig on, show her she's marrying Napoleon Dynamite
If there was a celebrity wedding I would like to go to, it is this one! Fun chaos will be had and so much good food will be served!
Josh and a good team could just do a bunch of prep work before hand to get it all ready and or pre cooked? And then hired people would just have to put it all together
Food at a wedding is important! You have to take time to eat. There is a reason the wedding couple gets their food first.
Look up a guy named chef Barry sexton, he did my wedding. He’s based in PA so I don’t know if it’ll work out but when I asked to see his menu he said what do you want to eat? All custom menu. He’s the chef from food network that caters food network events and has been on a few episodes of some food network shows. He was surprisingly affordable
They’re both so chaotic together I love it so so much
Welp yall figured out a simpler version of a menu for your wedding
Josh, how can I send y'all some hotsauce since you made a Chipotle sauce. My company is new, named Tusk, and I want to send you all a few bottles to enjoy.
I really hate that I can’t help but feel compelled to post this, but…fiancée, not fiancé.
God shes hotter than you. And youre hot lol
is it just me or does she look like ariana grande from some angles?
They call each other baby too much. Feels forced.
We need Gordon to give away Josh at his wedding
The thumbnail makes Josh look like he has jaundice lmao
I'd like to see some sort of wild beast as the ring bearer. Joshes bachelor party should be him and 24 of his closest friends running shirtless into the wilds to find and tame a wild beast to bring back as the ring bearer.
Where's the biltong and droëwors then?? Or pap & wors? 😀
thanks, i have a headache now
Hear me out: people come to your wedding, you cook for yourself, the Mythical Kitchen cooks for the rest of everyone. You get married behind the cooking station, then boom: dance party.
You want to do a destination wedding!!!
In terms of a Sinatra song, are you familiar with the Frank & Nancy duet of “Something Stupid”?
You absolutely need The Amazing Bottle Dancers!
Robert Irvine Dinner Impossible: Josh and Julia's wedding 🎉
oh my goodness, their chemistry is so cute!!
Comment anything, Josh.
What a perfect pair
I'm sure I'm not the first to say this but Julia has the same exact voice and intonation as Rosanna Pansino LOL
Lily's physical comedy is epic
Absolutely flipping adorable! ❤❤
This was just awesome entertainment from the start to the finish. My wife and I loved the menu that you guys put together and we wish you nothing but the best for your future!! Those shrimp tacos looked really tasty too, we might have to try those for dinner one day 😋!
I WAS JUST WONDERING WHEN THIS WOULD HAPPEN THE OTHER DAYYYYYYYYYY
Josh, she is psycho ! RUN !!!!
Maybe this is a bit for the show, but it sounds like Josh and Julia have very little planned. They were talking about the location of the wedding and where they should have it. If they dont have a location, then they dont have a date. You can't book a caterer or anything else if you dont have a location and date. After 2 years they need to stop having ideas and start making some descions.
Make a video of the crew attempting to rehearse your wedding menu. If it works you can make a second video of the actual wedding food prep. Two birds one stone. Also, I would pay a lot for that as advertised apron.
I spent $500 on my wedding. When I see expensive weddings all I think is, you spent that much on one day???? Use it on your honeymoon.  It’s so weird and gross to me.
Josh: Chaotic + Julia: Chaotic = UNHINGED and fun Chaotic couple
Both very attractive. They'll have beautiful babies.
There were times when they were both talking so much, and it reminded me of when Matty Matheson was on here.
Julia saying fun fact to josh is just what I needed lmaooo
I love that the title is just josh and fiance
I can see why they are engaged there both chaotic but in a good way love them
Sorry guys, but this was unwatchable, all constantly shouting over one another to the nth degree. Hope the food came out good though.
how is this couple so attractive like what
I've seen Julia twice, Josh a hell of alot on Mythical (and guest appearances on other channels) and he has absolutely found a Unicorn with Julia! She is absolutely perfect for him if she's like this all the time and it's not just a thing for the show. So happy for him
Josh is great! I hope you two are very happy together. Congrats!
“You guys seen saltburn? Its like that” 💀😂
OMG they are perfect for each other!
Josh  you are one lucky man
It kinda sounds like maybe you want a few different types of food truck to surround the wedding venue
"You're just as pretty as pretty does!"😂😂😂
What does one have to do to be invited to this wedding?
How do i get invited to this wedding?
At least do a mock wedding at good mythical evening next year... i'd buy a ticket just for that...
... So I can see why y'all got turned down lmfao
Are there usually 800 knives and cleavers behind them?
I am ready to sponsor the whole wedding
Yeah, this convinced me to be engaged forever.
This is to wholesome, I wish you two nothing but the best.
Who says weddings have to be stressful?  We got married at the Hard Rock Hotel Universal followed by burgers, ribs and Oreo cheesecake at the Hard Rock Cafe and celebrated at City Walk.  No pressure just a good (but pretty drunk) day.  And my guests loved that there were no speeches.
That menu does sound like a nightmare for a caterer. I don't think people understand how different it is to get dishes ready at the same time for a 100+ people, it's not the same as a restaurant
She sounds so annoying
The chaos duo of the century. I wish them a happy saucy carrot future together!
Did Julia just do the white power sign at 0:02 ?
Don't tell me you're gonna get married!
You guys live in LA - couldn't you hire like 12 different food trucks that specialize in the kind of food they will be serving, and they could make just the one dish per truck. It would be a real food fair
a friend of mine had a couple food trucks at his wedding. They were all different cuisines and provided and appetizer and a "dinner" course. Might be my favorite wedding meal with the most variety.
I feel like Matty Matheson could officiate and assemble the team needed to cater this wedding
She’s also annoying. Perfect match 😊
Wow l didn't know that Josh's family was from South Africa! My home country 👏
Cutest episode ever
Congratulations for your someday wedding... Send me a taco.
Pardon my English, but what in the wide wide world of sports is going on in this episode? I don't remember dropping acid.
🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤
Julia looks a lot like Lili Reinhart, anyone else agree?
No wonder I love you, Josh! You remind me of Julien! Always cook on high!
Elope. To Vegas. Zombie wedding
Super wholesome
Bold crossover but hear me out: Phoning it In: Try Guys Cater Josh and Julia's Wedding
I bet Josh groans when he gets up from a recliner and then asks who touched the thermostat. (It was him because his legs got chilly and he forgot that he turned it up)
I proposed to my wife with a 'marry me' fire sauce packet, and we later eloped to the Vegas Taco Bell cantina. It was magical.
Damn. Julia is as hot and crazy as Josh. He's a lucky man but I see too much crazy for it to last forever. I hope to be proven wrong. Also, Nicole was amazing, she should have a role on The Bear.
idk what to comment
I love yall 🙂 Congrats!
Have fun with the wedding planning, please do yourselves a favor and don't take it too seriously. The wedding is truly just one day.
Interesting she threw up a bunch of satanic symbolism and no one seems to care. Clearly threw the 666 handsign then one eye symbol and tongue out which is satanic fertility stuff. We are indeed in the last days.
Adopt me please
I've never seen Lily act so cursed.  She's usually incredibly pretty and so put together, but seeing her as a southern trash goblin made me giggle.  I usually drool over the food and laugh at the interactions between Josh and the characters, but this time I almost don't even remember the food.  Josh and Julia's energy was just as great as when he works with everyone else and it's incredibly sweet.  Loved the video, and I hope for nothing but the best for Josh and Julia.  I'm not familiar with Julia beyond these videos, but it's impressive how well she handles herself on camera for someone I've never seen on camera beyond the first video, which was also pretty great.  They're lucky to have each other in their lives, and that makes me happy.
"Just comment... I dont know what to comment"😂
Well these two are perfect for each other. Twins of chaos 😂
I’m convinced Josh & Julia could co-star in a comedic spy film, let’s make it happen? 🤷‍♂️
The mythical kitchen should cater the wedding and make a video of it
17:15 The best line of the whole episode. Josh you nailed it. Go for the elope to taco bell idea.
Everyone but Josh on the crew should cook his wedding food for them. Problem solved. 🎉
i was expecting the usual Baby Trevor
Best, most realistic, truth to heart episode you all have done! Great stuff!
Did Julia throw up the White Power sign in the intro?! 0:02
I would kill to be invited to their wedding!
If you have your wedding near a food festival then you can do the reception there. Just arrange with the vendors to prepay for the guests and they can each choose which booth to try. You could try the Del Mar Fair or the Gilroy Garlic Festival. They’re both fun and have tons of weirdly amazing foods.
Julia reminds me of Joan Cusack, they have similar mouth movements
You guys are so adorable together. I hope you have a magical wedding.
I’m a pastry chef if you invite me to your wedding and pay for the transportation, I’ll do your cake for free! Y’all are so cute!
As a former wedding caterer, "We paid you $9000 to do this?" has been said to every decorator and flower person I've ever met. XD
how did he get he to agree to that? She's a hard 8, and he's, like, a 5.
Stop this was so freaking cute
Festival style hire food trucks
Hearing that list tempted the idea of I would spend multiple days helping with prep if I had the change to eat all that cause that sounds amazing
They have the exact same energy and I love it!
You have to get Gordon Ramsey to cater your wedding..
I did go to the wedding of one of my chefs. He planned the whole menu and ordered and prepped the ingredients, then had most of the kitchen staff work that night and make everything following his recipes. His wife is a pastry chef, so she handled the cake and all the desserts.
Too chaotic I'm getting anxiety 😂
Just do pizza.
The mountain terrace is a pretty sick venue up near San Fran, overlooking the bay, they do great food and would probably do special menu, they have redwoods, highly recommend. My wife and I flew out there from Maryland to have our wedding. We also did his and her cocktails and had them named after our cats.
the chaotic energy here could set the atmosphere ablaze...  I love it!
Guys I got it! They should contact Top Chef and have catering their wedding be one of the challenges on the show! Almost like food wars they get split into groups and each of them gets an item from each part of the menu.
Oh no... I can 100% understand the caterers' decision lmao if you're not absolutely paying top dollar, you're not getting custom anything. I've been to plenty of banquet kitchens in the past year and have yet to see a place that makes their own apps/tray pass items in-house. All outsourced, shipped frozen. I'm on Josh's side here: he and Mythical Kitchen have a better chance cooking for his own wedding than counting on a standard banquet kitchen.
Congratulations Josh!  You're a good man and a great chef.
If anyone else wants a way to vet their partner mentally and emotionally but can't afford a big international trip, just get the two of you stuck in a traffic jam for 10 hours. Cost a helluva lot less than round trip airfare and you get the same results.
does josh have a big head or does his lady have a particularly small head and face
I just realized Josh isn't wearing Jorts 🤯
Two words: FOOD TRUCKS No way that 1 caterer can pull off your dream menu. But 5 food trucks, that are responsible for each course, can do it. I'm not a fan of having your guests wait in line for their dinner. So, a coordinator would have to be in charge of plating and delivery to the dining room tables. Totally doable. I used to work for a catering company and the Emmy awards after party had a similar set up. They were feeding well over 500 people (maybe closer to 1,000. I didn't count) so the smaller your wedding party, the better the quality and freshness of the final dish.
I fully disagree with a stove having 1 steady. Mine is either full blast on on burner or its off. But insurance says it wasn't damaged in the hurricane where water poured on it lol
Georgia MUST be at the wedding
They’re so unhinged, I love it.
Joshh just call Mike the situation! His wedding had all the foods
Josh, don't cook at your wedding. Use your influencer power to raise a million dollars for World Central Kitchen Thankmas style, and get Jose Andres to cater your wedding. That or food truck vendors individually hired. Individually hired food trucks.
either food trucks or have the venue near where there are food trucks
Honestly....wasnt expecting Julia to be just as chaotic as Josh...but at the same time, it makes so much sense. She should guest star more often XD
Trevor should have been thr kid running around.   Seriously though, they're super cute together.  I hope they can have thee dream wedding feat that they want.
YO. NICOLE SAID POUGHKEEPSIE RIGHT. Props Nicole! No one ever says it right!
where do we enter to win an invite to the wedding?
@codyko2
Josh has met his perfect match. Julia tempers his cray.
I'm so glad I'm not the only one doing the lil jon YEAH. I just taught my brother it a few weeks ago
Love & Chaos: The Mythical Story of Real Silly, Pretty People Who Wanna Be Themselves Turned Up To 11 for Each Other at All Times  And we absolutely love them for it
idk why I expected her to be the straight man to Josh's Kramer. They're both Kramer lol
Engaged for 5 years- eloped and went to a favorite date restaurant with some friends and family after. Highly recommend.   Also this video is great- you guys are too cute.
I don't care what you eat, but I gotta see this wedding. Y'all are chaos and love and food and I wanna see.
Rosanna?
They are the sweetest couple!  I suspect Mythical will do something to make their wedding beyond epic!
You’re a cute couple. It will be an awesome wedding.
Just close family and small wedding or making it to be content and get r&l to pay it😄
Come on gordon <3 plan their wedding :3
6:16 Josh saying he wants their wedding to feel like a music festival, they should totally call it Tie The Knotfest!!😂
That menu sounds incredible and like a dream
If one company cant do the catering, Do an episode of multiple ones cooking just a few dishes off the menus each(cook off style content right off) then film the wedding multi catering areas and right off that too.
Josh embrace her she’s sweet
Have like 7 different food trucks outside and let people have at it.
No one will see this comment but they did ask for opinions so here’s something I want to do at mine that I think they’ll love: with the RSVPs I want to add recipe cards for our guests to fill out, then at the wedding we compile them all into a cookbook. It can be whatever recipe they want, their favorite, a special occasion dish, something that their spouse enjoys, just a compilation of recipes full of love and hope from people who care about you and want you to succeed. I think it’s a lot more meaningful than signing a photo 😅  Edit to add still so happy for you guys you’re adorable together and I can’t wait for the eventual wedding whenever it happens
16 courses for a wedding bro? this is real life not a fairy tale lmao
Welp there i go, off to find the nearest bridge 🌉👌🏼
9:48 lily plays the best drunk family member
I wonder if Gordon Ramsey would cook the food?
I have hope because it sounds like Josh’s life has been hard. Working hard towards his passions to be his definition of successful and being honest about the roadblocks on the way, but also the people who didn’t mesh.  Having someone like Julia who doesn’t just say she loves someone but brings positive words into everything he does for them. I may not be an amazing chef and hyper buff but I have hope the onslaught of being treated like an object will end soon for me
I GOT THE BABYS BREATH HOMIE I GOTCHU😂
That lady constantly barging in is annoying
That salt burn joke 😂
The first three seconds show why they are meant for each other. The vibes match!!!
As a florist, wedding, planner, and a home chef. I’m dying to take this wedding on
If you invite the whole company and live stream it, wait for it...GMW! Good Mythical Wedding -- they'll pay for it!
The chaos on her eyes makes their relationship make so much more sense ❤
They should just hire a bunch of food trucks and a taco guy
I don't know what to comment
Josh’s fiancé is both gorge and capable of matching his chaotic energy.  A match truly made in heaven.
The long-awaiting sequel to my favorite Mythical Kitchen episode
When they said "sabotage" I was thinking psycho Lily with her blowtorch.
My wife and I eloped in an alley with a friend who could do marriages and had a surprise reception at a local restaurant. Just elope, it's 100% the right move. This is my actual advice to you as a stranger on the internet.
haven't they been engaged for like 80 years
For your wedding dinner tables, do edible arrangements! Not like the shitty company Edible Arrangements, but like 100% edible plants/flowers/fruits as your centerpieces. Even if your guests don't engage with it literally, it would be a really cool and unique feature to your wedding!
LA-based viewer here 🙋‍♀...I have contact info for a private chef in LA that did the food for my friend's wedding to their taste (also incorporating her own culinary style and areas of expertise, of course). The food was phenomenal. Anyway, I think a private chef is the direction you're gonna want to go in instead of a catering company that only works from their own cookie-cutter, preset menu. Real talk, let me know the best way for me to send you her info if you're interested!
So $20,000 for the catering only?
BABYS BREATH
This GMM on crack. Perfect MK episode.  Lily is fantastic! Penelope (Nicole) is perfect
I never knew Josh had South African roots
Description of that menu reminds me of a food truck festival.  Rent out a field, park some food trucks out there, hire a death metal band and go crazy
So when my buddy got married he and I went out looking for cake toppers and I picked Gohan and Videl action figures.  Only about 4 people at the wedding got the reference.
Ok, get Jonny Cakes to bake you a cake, have a taco food truck, and just fancy up the parking lot at Mythical. Get a DJ and hit up Costco for lots of liquor. Dress up Josh like a Chippendale dancer because he hates shirts anyway, get Julie a cute dress. It's done! Lol honestly, place, food, clothes and you're good. I wasted so much time and effort on programs.
Josh I love you and all you do, so what's with the back street boy's hair cut
Josh's family is from South Africa?  That makes him African American.
I sometimes wonder if Josh stops and contemplates how he's helped create and unleash the phenomenon that Lily has become and whether there are regrets or pride. Depends on the situation? Little bit of both?
Make your wedding potluck, friends can provide a dish from your dream menu in place of a gift
Man did anyone else catch the roll away shrimp?
I wanna be the dubstep DJ for your wedding 💍💒💍
OMG totally hire a videographer to capture every bit of chaos! And share with us.
2:20 Most memorable Jewish Christmas was eating a tower of shellfish, LOOOL love it. To hell with the antiquated food restrictions!
That is probably the most amazing wedding menu ever I want to go.
: )
I think Josh should have Tallah play at his wedding.  I'm sure the singer Justin Bonitz would totally be down.
Josh And Fiancé
Y'all just need to invite a bunch of food trucks to your wedding
Planning a wedding with Josh would give me a heart attack.
Five Head idea. Go to Rhett and Link and put your wedding on the Internet and get them to expense it through the company and then they can use the crew for your catering and etc..
She’s super cute. WTG Josh!
We all know their wedding will be fire...it wont be basic food 😂
Love ya cuz but I see why the caterer said no 😂   No one will starve at this wedding lol
Surprised you havent asked your dad to get married in one of his restaurants
5:19 oh no, I hate when I get shrimp juice on my bare shoulders :(
Is this what happens when you get two labrador people together
Julia is so cute and so funny and that was absolutely hilarious. Julia fit right in to the chaos that is Mythicial Kitchen!
Toxicity by Vitamin String Quartet. You're welcome.
Julia almost putting the blender lid back on after Josh licked it was giving me anxiety
Lean into the festival vibe and do food trucks at your wedding. You'll be able to get the different variety and guests can go to each truck as they like. Have a outdoor bar and tables. Can be a tent for the DJ and dancing
my sister married a chef and they were both super keen on and "All Apetizer" wedding. so they found a resturant with a ballroom that was willing to do it for them. There was a tradtional "cocktail hour" with passed hor dourves and a raw bar.  Then we went into the ballroo, and it was set up like a wedding , with assigned seating and settings at every seat...and then the hor dourves just kept coming.  Salad was brought ot everyone (you need some roughage in your diet) and then at the fourcorners of the room, 4 carving/meat/pasta stations open up for like 45 min. and then they flipped them to 4 different stations (there was a beef both times, cavetelli and broc, totelinni alfredo, squab, pork loin, a seafood option, and mabey turkey) , and for the kicker after dinner instead of the traditional Vienesse Table, the resturant had a Vienesse ROOM..... it was by far the best wedding i ever went to
I feel like Josh would be the guy to volunteer his wedding catering as a task for some Food Network reality competition.
You don’t eat at your own wedding 😅 my husband and I did BBQ with Mac n cheese, pull pork, etc which I was so excited to eat and got an ice cream truck but when the day came I was barely hungry.  Perhaps it’s the excitement of the moment or something but I wish I was hungrier
They should be one of those couples that has a reception in Hells Kitchen
I'm guessing based on all the shellfish that this wedding will not take place in Great Neck.
For menu 2.0 think of efficiency and stability, some things can get over cooked sitting on a steam table, having to cook multiple proteins in different ways is inefficient and makes restocking food a pain. Shrimp and chicken can be used for two dishes each to increase efficiency (po boy and chicken cheese stake). Pasta gets soggy, so a vegetarian option that stays good like curry is a good option plus two rice cookers that can be switched when new rice needs to be made.
You two are nuts and I wish you every happiness! 😁 Keep the menu tight, keep the booze flowing, and make sure the DJ knows his stuff to get people on the dance floor.  It will be a wonderful event!
Josh look s absolutely terrible. What happened?
I would totally watch your wedding
The Omni Bedford Springs Hotel, made 6 of my husband and I's favorite dishes as tapas for our wedding. They also did a wine paring for each tapas station It was awesome! They even cooked my husband's grandmother's personal recipe for a Chilean pastel de choclo. No traditional sit down dinner for us but it was better for a party that way anyway 😊 best of luck on your wedding planning journey!
❤❤❤❤❤
Just ask every guest to bring a dish to pass and skip the catering!   Tell them all to bring something that goes with saucy carrots 🥕
Can you have like a 2nd wedding at the Taco Bell Cantina? And can I come?
You two are so adorkable
8:53 HE'S SOUTH AFRICAN?! and yet, somehow that makes sense..
Crystalized Ginger carrots are the most amazing way to cook carrots! Must be crystalized ginger though
Josh hates physical touch, but he looks so comfortable touching Julia. That's what love looks like.
Obviously since Gordon loves Josh he can get the next season of Masterchef Chefs to cater his wedding
Trevor couldn’t make it so close to being perfect!!!!
Love this so much!! Mazel!!
the saltburn comment 😭
It's a little weird that Nicole and Josh's fiancé sound exactly the same.😳
Ok but hear me out. Have your wedding menu made by Mythical Kitchen and use that for content! It would be cool to see all the creative dishes and get a bit of a sneak peek at your wedding!
This wedding sounds like a sick festival id buy a ticket
OMG cutest thing I've seen this year🥺🎉
I'd really like some kind of semi regular thing with these two. Some sort of date night cooking tips kinda deal.
Okay, I love the story with the carrots.  I knew I was in love with my husband when I ran into target on the way to Reno for our first date (we live in Sacramento only like 3 hours away), and I couldn’t stop thinking how guilty I felt leaving him in the car while I went inside to grab napkins and use the restroom.
I really really hope you see this. Our wedding was budget friendly and EVERYONE constatly brings up, 6 years later, how it was the "best wedding." Our backyard (or public parks you can get event permits cheap) and have a food truck come! We had a taco truck come, just over 1k and we had way too much food for 60 guests = tacos all weekend. EDIT, ya'll are friggen adorably goofy. What a good pair.
Can we all just say what Josh is implying out loud? The mythical kitchen catering Josh's wedding is  1. What Josh and his wife deserve 2. What we deserve  3. A content goldmine
As someone from Poughkeepsie it was jarring to hear my hometown’s name in a MK video
8:13 This is not Sinatra, this is "Come Sail Away" by Styx. Either way, great karaoke songs.
I could see alot of domestic violence between them at home and they trying to act okay on TV just imagine how they are at home
If you want to learn who Josh is, all you have to do is watch him very gently lean over Julia to carefully pour oil into the blender, whilst simultaneously yelling into her ear so we can hear him over the noise of said blender.
i thought it was gonna be "meal we would like to eat before we die"
That wedding is content that someone needs to capitalize on. I understand why you would rather the Mythical Kitchen crew be at the wedding rather than in the kitchen, but someone else like Babish, Sorted, etc should certainly take up the catering.
Honestly you guys should send your menu to Robert Irvine, he might be able to make edits for you or find someone who can make it happen. Wedding Impossible?
I've never felt more confident that two people are soul mates then her reading all the food off like it's only a few things 😂
why does joshs fiance sound exactly like rosanna pansino. its actually wild
In the odd chance yall see this lol. Just elope. Wife and I wish we just did that or had a small thing with our close friends and family.
Run your wedding like a shoot. Wedding party = talent. Dp/camera get a shot list. 1st Ad runs everything on the day, Art dept gets flowers from downtown / sets up the venue, etc Also we got married in NoLa and it was the best party ever!
and here I was caring what would be served at this guys wedding
Your Wedding menu seems amazing!
My friend just got married this last October so I learned a lot about wedding planning through that. You need to pick a location and date first, and have backups just in case. Make sure the dresses are all picked out so you can have ample time for alterations if they're needed. The food is important, invitations. Even things like table setting and chair selections and colors/themes. Weddings are stressful even for a stressful event ngl 😅
this is so chaotic and i love it. they literally are perfect for each other. so happy for them🙌🏼
I've never felt so alone watching these 2 in love
Can we hear the slow soad toxicity.
I hope to one day find a wife as perfect for me as Julia and Josh are for each other
But now I want to see the wedding
Josh crying about wedding catering being expensive when it always has been + yalls live in cali. Why wouldnt it be nore expensive? 😂😂
Elope, please!  Love the video. You guys should elope to a food and wine festival.  Disney’s is pretty solid.  Take close friends and family.  Pressure off.  Sending love!
I really want Josh to do a Last Meals episode with Julia, those episodes are very in depth and seeing how similar they both are I think it would make a great episode.
They look like cousins! wow, josh!!!
I vote for eloping to Vegas. It is what my wife and I did 21 years ago.
You couldn't manage to put Julia's name in the title of the video?
14:08 yup I completely understood the rejection lmao
Is Josh Jewish South African?! So am I!
Elope!! Save the money.  Work hard on your marriage and celebrate each year together.
I feel like you should just hire a bunch of food trucks to fulfill all of your food wishes and just let it be a full party!
6:15 screaming crying throwing up 😭❤️
Josh's dream wedding is also my dream wedding lol. System of a down and jag bombs sounds incredible
The pleated pants are horrible
That carrot story is perfection and is a hell of a first date story 💗
Elope at the taco bell cantina 😂
Why don't you just get hire out food truck vendors - i.e. a taco truck, I'm sure you can find an ice cream vendor, burger, pizza etc food trucks....have the wedding outside...then just pay the vendors based on food eaten....like you said food festival vibes...literally do a food festival.
Josh jokes, but my brother got married at the Taco Bell Cantina in Vegas and it was so much fun 😂
I just got an idea for your caterer! As I remember him saying in what I think was an episode of Wild Ride with Steve-O, Flavor Flav is a Cordon Bleu-trained chef, specifically in institutional cooking. You could see if he'd do both your wedding courses AND an episode of Last Meals!
Yay Julia's back! I think I may have to go re-watch the other episode with her after this.
Recipe for peri peri chicken?
you two are so damn cute.
.....Yeah I'm with the caterers..... LOL! But I hope you can find someone to do the whole menu!
you knew i have an assignment due tomorrow. That has to be the reason, because this is the only video that will make me drop anything to watch it T^T you guys are cruel
Elope. My husband and I did, best decision ever. Then come back and have a party 🎉
Wedding planning IS stressful. Mine was mid sized (abt 70pp). Had some life changes and had to cut way back...that was 21 years ago. It was lovely tho on the cheap. For anybody engaged and on a budget: ❤ Anyway, keep it small, have an anniversary bbq later to invite those you couldn't. (Guest list is the WORST) ❤We had a morning wedding so less expectations re: food. ❤Work with a planner (glad y'all are doing that!). Best wedding gift I had was a friend was a professional planner.
I feel that maybe they need to move their wedding location to a funky Vegas chapel and buffet hop for the party
Have your wedding outdoors, then have food trucks
she looks like Jeanna de Waal here (this is the best compliment i can bestow)
Yep Penelope is the best
AWWWW
To solve the catering issue, have a weekend where opening night is part of your menu, the other night is like a bridal party sports game day with early attendee spectators with the second part of food, and then have your champion dishes for your wedding day/reception. Takes you through your love the way you want it to while still having space in between. :) also possibility of still having it a tad food festival style :)
I'll plan your wedding for two spots on the show. Seriously, I'm very good at organizing. I've planned events of tends of thousands. A wedding would be cake... (see what I did there? Ha!)
His wife already has a BEEF CAKE all to herself 😏
Do not kiss anyone from Poughkeepsie is what I heard
Don't just upload a video of the wedding. Just invite all Mythical Beasts with a plus 1 😉👍
Am I the only one who noticed how Josh touched the raw shrimp, wiped his hands on his apron and the touched her shoulder   My OCD would flip out!
I would love to see this segment for Lily and her fiancé’s wedding 😅
SAVE IT FOR UNDER THE CHUPAH! I diedddddd
CADY HARON THIS IS FOR YOU THAT WAS SO FUNNY LILLY
On one hand, I was disappointed that Lily didn't show up with a blowtorch which is TERRIFYING just for her facial expression when she showed up with the blowtorch in the Thanksgiving sabotage episode. Lily makes for a convincing drunk Nashville debutante. We need more Penelope. Nicole should just randomly walk off camera and come back with the jacket, clipboard, and headset as Penelope from now on. V as the flower girl is fun. She actually hugs trees.
i think yall should hire like ten different food trucks to just sit outside and cater.
"Caddy Heron, this is for you!" Love the reference!!
we need MORE OF HER THEY HAVE SO MUCH CHEMISTRY
GET A COUPLE FOOD TRUCKS!! We rented a BBQ food truck for mine and my husbands wedding and it was the best! Depending on the size of the wedding you might get two different food trucks but it was the best decision for us!  We also had a bounce castle 😂
Jeagar with monster or with Red Bull? I forgot which is better mix. Regardless I think that is a good choice for libations
I need pap and chakalaka on mythical kitchen!
naw
2:02 I have a lil rant about cooking things on medium. I live with my boyfriend and his dad. Anytime we are in the kitchen and his da is sitting down, he will get up, I’m nit shitting you it’s not even a minute later and put his dish in the sink or fill up his water and if we are cooking something on the stove he will turn it down to medium. Every. Single. Time. Drives me absolutely bonkers I’ve started to just leave the kitchen if I see him shuffle things like he’s bout to get up. What is that? Send help.🛟
his hair...  it's getting long again... chaos reigns...
They are the most chaotic couple! 🤣 💕I’m happy that they are so happy, but they are going to need professional help if they intend to ever put a wedding together 😅  Time to hire a wedding planner!
You. Are. Wearing. Pants. Mind. Blown. 🤯💣lol
So, I'm a wedding planner coordinator: Establish budget, guest count, decide on a date and then find a venue. Photographer, caterer DJ, and videographer should be second followed by florist, officiant and baker- Then discussing theme/color scheme/overall vibe. I hope this helps you a little bit.
Honestly, you guys are much cuter now than 2 years ago. Sure, you're withered by the wedding planning process, but that's clearly made your relationship stronger and after the stress of this there's nothing else you can't handle.
Should you televise your wedding? Are you getting married for television or for love?
"josh and fiance" lol
i’m about to fly the california and plan this this is my college education i got this
Me chifla
Josh! Just hire food trucks bro! Easy to find most of that food in LA!
This was one of the best MK videos! And Nicole was beyond incredible. She was straight up knocking the comedy out of the park.
All jokes aside the mythical kitchen should cater Josh's and Julia's wedding.
Josh’s family is from South Africa?
BOY OH BOY! I Sure would like some content on how to cater a meal for a wedding. If only the Mythical Kitcheneers made a series of episodes on how to cater a wedding...  Like what would that look like if the Mythical Kitchen catered a wedding and made content an sold merch that was Josh's wedding themed...
I think you guys should get a wedding planner lmao, Julia seems so stressed this whole video, I'd hate to see what the actual wedding would do
I kinda assumed the Mythical Kitchen would cater for them lol
Is Josh not doing jorts anymore?
hire mythical crew as catering
You two are the cutest couple, both silly. Perfect match
She's REAL?!  /j
Wedding catering is so expensive. My wife and I are vegan, and every caterer was gonna charge us a minimum of 3k for what was always like roasted vegetables in a tomato sauce. My two friends and I did all of the cooking for 500 dollars (hardware and cookware included), I don’t recommend for everybody, but maybe we should get into catering.
Their children are going to be soooo chaotic🥴🫠
Yall are so cute! So perfect for one another! Wishing yall the best wedding anyone can have! Love the food stories!❤
Julia is Josh if Josh didn't know how to cook.
Honestly guys, take all the time you need. There's no expiration date in such things. Wish you both all the best.
What about sourcing some of your fave foods from multiple sources, have it all delivered and set up family/buffet style with Buffet warming tays...
WOW! She is as high-energy as you are Josh! perfect match.
Why not have wedding food trucks? So you can have loads of different stuff without killing your caterers (also - y’all are adorable!)
I really want Emily to officiate the ceremony.  That is all.
why is she such a cutie patootie
Unless Julia is a man it should be fiancée
Is that Ramsay’s daughter
I don’t know what to comment, say something. Help us.
They are so cute and chaotic, congrats to Josh and Julia. I think yall should rent a nice outdoor space and truly have it festival style with food. I'm also fond of the Pittsburgh "cookie table" tradition, where close friends and family bring homemade cookies for the event. It might also be worth it to talk with Rhett and Link about doing a Culinary mass collaboration with the chefs you know, make it a vlog/video of the cooking process, and have each chef cook a dish off your menu, making it not too labor intensive for anyone. You could also ask Trevor to connect you with Amanda from smosh cast, who does flower arrangements. Why not make your wedding a showcase of all the beautiful artists around you, in and out of the kitchen.
Lily is the chaos goblin I never knew I needed.
I DEFINITELY need to see/be at you guys wedding so yes please make that happen xoxo
You telling me Josh has been African American this whole time?! LOL
Jaegerbomb was essentially my sister's drink for the His and Hers drinks at her wedding.
2 years was way too long between these episodes lol
ITS JULIA!!!! YAY!
I would 100% buy a "life's too short to cook on medium" sticker, magnet, etc.
She’s gorgeous, congrats Josh
omg... they are perfect for eachother. just unbridled chaos in a flesh suit.
Julia reminds me of a really funny Anna Paquinn
Josh I thought we had something </3
Good Mythical Wedding. Easy
I’m reminded of George and Gracie Allen, but faster paced….ya - I’m old.  These two are adorkable!! ☮️❤️
Just do a tapas style menu with most of the stuff on the list in a yard party style after the ceremony. Make it easier and just as chaotic as you two.
A slowed down acoustic version of toxicity would be so cool at a wedding lol
Josh's Frank Sinatra was uncanny!😂😂😂
@Mythical Kitchen My uncle is a chef who wanted to cook at his own wedding too but it’s too much he asked a friend from school in Paris maybe get in touch with your chef friends I’m sure you have at least one you can think of
We did a taco bar from a local taqueria that grilled the meat and tortillas fresh in the parking lot including some lengua for me. Still the best wedding food I've ever had.
Lily screaming “my  quinceañera” 17:31 😂😂😂
Solution.....  Sporked and Mythical chefs as well as Taco trucks cover the food, Live stream the wedding, have Rhett get ordained......  enjoy highest viewed Mythical video ever
I am so lazy and I would say to just elope and then have a backyard/food festival like party on your terms in your own time.
The frenetic energy between these two. Love it.
i hope you get divorced
I can't believe that josh is cheating on me.... I love that josh feels the exact same way about cooking that I do.... Except that I hate seafood.
SHE'S BACK!!!
Congratulations! So for future reference, Josh is Julia’s fiancé, and Julia is Josh’s fiancée. French is weird that way.  :)
Make the cooking of the wedding meal content gordon ramsey style a bunch of chefs working real hard to push out the great quality food quickly maybe have people on teams for each part of a meal or something live stream it and pay all the chefs involved with the money made from the stream  (not an actual recommendation but it would be fun as hell, they dont even have to mention the wedding at all😂)
So hear me out....This would have been better without Nicole and everyone being chaotic
That was so nice of Lily to leave her post as Belle at Disney to swing by the Mythical kitchen
Honestly this video just brought infinite joy to my life
my top idea for wedding dinner: pot luck, saves money and everyone gets to have their favourite food
is it not fiancée?
ahhhh she's so cute
One day Rhett, Link, Josh, and Emily will have a GMM episode where they will tell nothing but dad jokes.
If in California, definitely tie the knot in Tahoe. I’d be honored to give you some local insight into some of the lesser known beautiful spots of my home :)
good god I'm equal parts happy for them equal parts Ted sitting on a park bench throwing rocks at couples saying "why should they be happy?". FML.
I need that carrot recipe for sure!!
His fiancé looks like Joan Cusack
We "catered" our own wedding, and it was actually a hit.  Rented a little shelter at the nearby lake, had the ceremony by the water, then changed clothes and went up to the shelter where I BBQ'd (KC style baby!) the meats 'n stuff while the wife and friends got the cold sides and drinks together.  We did everything except the Cake ourselves and it really wasn't as difficult as we expected.
You both need a food truck wedding
I think your wedding is missing a daredevil jumping over a pool of sharks, electric eels, and man eating lions (a la The Simpsons).
FINALLY! I have been waiting for another video of the two of y'all since the last one was posted. Just the pure amazing chaos (in the best way possible)
Don't really trust couples too much that call each other "baby" but man what a video. Haha. Congrats, y'all!
Have you thought about splitting the menu between multiple caterers? That would take the pressure off of trying to find one that will supply everything.
Love his hair ❤ Congrats 🍾
These guys are so social it makes me sick. Good stuff.
im with ya on cook temp Josh XD
They are adorable
What's this hairdo Josh has been rocking? Someone say something to him before it gets out of hand like Link last year 🤣
What's this hairdo Josh has been rocking? Someone say something to him before it gets out of hand like Link last year 🤣
You could do a different caterer for each section of the menu￼
These two are so cute together it makes me want to scream LOL  Good on you Josh for finding someone that shares that sparkle in their eyes when you talk hehehe!
I'D WATCH A MYTHICAL WEDDING. WITH ALL 16 COURSES ON THE MENU
Rule #1: Do NOT tell places you are ordering for a Wedding. They will usually double the price just because it is for a wedding.  Also Tip, use cheap stuff where people wont see it (far away flowers can be false/fabric), order a Sheet Cake to be cut and served in the back and only use a small cake for the "pictures/cake cutting ceremony). Ask the Caterer if you can have a different menu for the wedding party vs. guests. For example, only get steak/salmon for the wedding party and guests get Chicken or something tasty yet more affordable per plate. Also, make your own Invitations. NO ONE cares if it comes in a fancy envelope. SnapFish the heck out of that and call it a day...
DON'T DO IT, YOU COULD DO SO MUCH BETTER......NOT YOU JOSH
"I just hit 12,000 steps."  I laughed way too hard at that. 🤣
Y'all are gonna need new up and coming DJ @NoahJ456 if you want some dubby techno house music at that wedding
I was first introduced to yall by my loving partner. We both would love to meet the entire staff and on a personal note, I would love to officiate yalls wedding and help make it a beautiful moment. I am in Iowa and would fly out just to have the honor to meet yall. I truly wish yall all the best. Please consider.   PS- I could finally show Josh how to cook a steak the right way lol.
I didnt think josh like women
As someone who just got married about 2 years ago, holy cannoli that wedding menu sounds bonkers midway through the ep.  Half of that stuff could just be cocktail hour.  But also it's a lot of variety for people who will get full off one plate.  I think you need to pare the list down a bit.  Or expect to pay a boatload of cash because the amount of food they need to make sure they'd have enough of requires a lot of cost.
Ex-wedding videographer here: Do not bother with a wedding video. You will watch it once and it will cost WAY more than it's worth, no matter how good the folks behind the camera happen to be. Just get a good two-person photography team. They'll capture everything you need from the getting ready down to the last few fun moments at the reception before everyone's too sloshed to function.  If you need the ceremony filmed for out-of-towners, just get a single shot at the back of the room set up with a mic planted on Josh and the Officiant and patched right into the camera. No editing costs, you get what you need, and you have more money to spend on your life.
I volunteer to help Josh cook for his wedding I’d love to learn more skills in the kitchen
Fiancée*
Whenever I am reminded that Josh has a fiancé I always feel like she’s going to be a very sweet quiet shy girl to offset him and then I’m like “Oh right, she’s josh”
tbh put up a poll for all wedding guests to vote for what foods they want. You dont have to follow it, but it'll be a good frame of reference
Just elope and then throw a party
You don’t need a caterer, do the ultimate collaboration. Get the sorted food guys to cook for your wedding. They love that stuff.
Am I going insane? I thought they called off the wedding and broke up? Or was that somebody else?
What you do, is you hire a wedding planner and give her or him the the numbers to all of your chef connections and they can help you make your menu LOL that would be so cool.  OHHHHH GORDONNNNN
Hells Kitchen Challenge: Josh and Julia’s wedding 👀👀👀
So happy for you both!! 🎉 y’all rly making me believe in love again 😢 🥹
Josh should just hire all his guests from Last Meals to cater his wedding
I love that Julia is as much of a ham as Josh. This a big ole bunch of adorable.
It's funny with relationships you have the media entertainer version of yourself and your private one. Typically when you have a loud one like Josh, you tend to be more reserved at home. I'm willing to bet Julia is the loud one at home when the camera's are off.  I will say Julia came off holding her own on camera. Must be all those years with Josh lol
Julia is delightful😊
I can't imagine there's a kitchen big enough in all of California to tackle that wedding menu lol
Josh I’m with you I catered my entire wedding menu. I did not want some other Chef to screw up my vision of my wedding food. And everyone loved it!!!
Idk what to comment..
I really wanna get married but skip the wedding. Cause that sounds way too stressful and expensive.
Honestly, designing an entire wedding based on those carrots wouldn’t be very hard at all.
They work so well together ❤😂
I was expecting a way more outlandish menu, its elaborate but not crazy
Is it possible to have the wedding at a private dining club? I worked at one that did the cooking in-house as well as host weddings and receptions. You might be able to work with their chef on creating a (feasible) menu.  The other option is to create a team of chefs, cooks, and servers to work the wedding.
I'm obsessed with them ❤ she needs to come on more often. I love it!!!
Wish i made good money and was good looking to find a pretty girl. Not sure how to even meet women anymore lmao,  Envy this man 👍🏻
Josh I've watched you for years...and seeing your fiancés energy level and ability to keep up with you. It's great!!!
adhd planning 101:  ignore the broadstrokes (location and venue) and go straight to first dance song and signature cocktail lol. I feel like im looking into my future LOL.
I actually think they're holding it together than most. Freak out more dammit you have a wedding to plan !
And I thought Josh and Trevor were the chaotic couple ever
Josh is so South African-core fr. he said 'lemme get that Nando's on my wedding' and i love that for them lmao 🇿🇦
If they have kids please call one of them Rogan....
Julia might be the only person who can match Josh's on screen energy 😂
You guys should just do a bunch of food trucks!
I know the "Trap Violinist" -Clejan, Josh and Julia lol Shameless plug 🤦🏾‍♀️😅 RECEPTION TURN UP
Geez, it's like she was made to be on camera.    Saying she's a natural is an understatement
Last Meals with Julia would go hard.
I know what I'd eat at that wedding...ass.
Just have it at a LA food truck street fair
Eloping was one of the best things I’ve ever done. That day was my Least stressful day by far ❤
Why does Julia remind me of Rosina 😂😂
Lilly is great!
Josh blows
She hit the jackpot. I know his previous gf is mad
I don’t know I’m old fashioned because of my mom. My thoughts is your marriage is between you and your partner and god. So just get married in a church by a priest and live happy together. Who says you need to invite everyone to YOUR special day?
I think it's safe to say you know quite a few people who know their way around a kitchen. Why not make part of your registry the catering menu and rock it potluck style.   You got microwave burritos or frito pie on there?
I don't know what to comment
I needed this today.. thank you! 😁😂🤣😆
While the menu sounds delicious, Josh you darn well know that it’s an incredibly unrealistic and insanely expensive idea
so youre telling me they both have the same golden retriever energy and found each other?? lol yes.
Josh plz invite me to your wedding I'll sing tequila in front of all your guests
Definitely vote for a Mythical wedding!!!
I’m not used to Josh’s new middle part, this looks like a video from 2 years ago 😂
This video was only slightly triggering as a wedding planner. But seeing how perfect Josh and Julia are, the planning will be stressful but absolutely worth it.
Please live stream the ceremony and let the mythical beasts be part of your magical day!
Call Gordon, Hell's Kitcheh task to cater your wedding. Make them make the pudding and the wellington
👰‍♀️🩷🤵‍♂️
I’m not a fan of couples they monetize their relationships so I hope they don’t make a video out of it.   But they are cute and I hope Julia comes back on the channel from time to time.
Josh touched the shrimp, almost touched Julia's shoulder, then rubbed his hair.
Congratulations!  I love weddings & cannot wait to see y'alls pictures. ......take it from my experience........simple is beautiful & way less stressful.
Julia matches Josh’s chaos perfectly. Dang that was a bit much to watch but fun. You can see the love. Definitely meant for each other. Also shoutout to the editing department I knew this was  hard one lmao 😂so much footage on the cutting room floor
So, you definitely should have your wedding at a buffet 😂😂 just rent one out for a few hours.
you two are so adorable together happy these two destined to get married
love the poughkeepsie callout!
If one caterer won't do it. Consider hiring two? Caterers
GORDON better cater this wedding😭
I’d watch the wedding
Get Gordan to cater their wedding! I demand it.
I work for a wedding planner in New Orleans. I got y’all if you want to get married down here!
Lily (A Michelin Star Chef): “I need my tiara back! This is my quinceañera!”
These two are so beautiful together, I can't wait for Josh to cater their entire wedding entirely on his own with a live cooking station at the reception that only he is allowed to touch.
Your fiance is pretty, is she single?
sounds like the last course may need to be Tums or Pepto. SPICY
julia reading their wedding menu made me realize why she’s so perfect for josh lmao
the chaotic energy of planning a wedding was real in this video lol, i forgot that this was about food, so when they showed the finished dishes at the end I was like "oh look, food?!" lol
Julia and Nicole sound so similar! I love that their energy is matched.
Currently planning my own wedding and it is very much this chaotic and confusing and all over the place.
Josh said it properly, Tacos GobernadoR, forgot the R in the title card :)
Josh and the Mythical Kitcheneers should just cook for his wedding, and Nicole should be the planner.
new years engaged no marriage kinda crazy. Good luck guys.
I love the fact that josh is a big fan of SOAD, he's mentioned sweing serj and always references their works, i hope to hear the slowed down+acoustic version of toxicity.
I had no idea Josh's family is from South Africa!
Josh and Julia are entertaining enough, you really didn't need the others to interrupt as a 'bit' WAY too much chaos. Just the two of them are chaotic enough.
😅😅😅
You could see if two caterers would agree to work together and split it up. One for seafood + tacos + soup and another for salad + mains/sides + sauces + dessert.
Cutest straight couple I've seen in a long time. You two are so good together! I don't pretend to understand wedding stuff, but I wish you two the best! 💜
They seem so happy together and I love that for them 🥹  I wish them all the best in their pending nuptials ❤
I know you can film making the food and you’re not making it because it is your wedding . You shouldn’t be making it, but the rest of the mythical kitchen is. Lol Well, you watch in commentate that would be the funniest video ever.
I would love to see the wedding. But it doesn't matter what anyone thinks, you do what makes you happy for your wedding. That is all that matters 👍🏾
Mythical, cater their wedding, you cowards
I would just like to point out that fiancé refers to a male and fiancée refers to a female, so the title is incorrect
Would be awesome to have a recipe sight for mythical kitchen. I really want to make these foods. Or can Josh have some cooking classes?
Josh definitely will definitely marry up
fun vid....but this thought popped into my head which is that I bet they don't subscribe to any type of redpill ideology and yet the very biology of the relationship tells everything. He's taller and she clearly likes him literally "running the show" (metaphor for all successful female/male relationships) they have also yet to elope....Women like men who are masculine/have status/money to be able to basically be in control but without telling them what to "do" specifically. They just like to fall into place. Men in "life" don't have the luxury to "fall into place" we have to build the place the name the brand and then we get women (plural on purpose).
My husband and I will have been married for 29 years this year...in terms of your wedding plans, my advise? ELOPE! 😂
Getting married? You telling me the mythical kitchen isn't a large poly couple
Josh straight up stealin eddie burbacks fit.
I was 100% sure I saw something that they had broke up. I can’t find anything about it now. Ig I dreamed it
What a fun episode!  I hope that you two have a long and happy life together ❤️
This was complete chaos lol
Saucy Carrots could be the drag queen officiating their wedding?
Please, I will do anything to get invited to this wedding. It's going to have the right amount of chaos, and I am for that!
Given how much food Josh has spitting out of his mouth involuntarily at any given time, his fiancée is altogether the WRONG height in proportion to his face
Lily is a treasure 😂
JOSH I HATE YOUR HAIR PLEASEEEEEEE 😭 PLEASE GET RID OF MIDDLE PART PLEASE IM BEGGING
Josh had me at acoustic, slowed down Toxicity. We really are two Josh's
The optimal wedding music is a DJ + a live brass ensemble accompaniment
....i can see why the caterers didn't want to handle that
Lily kills me every time 🤣🤣🤣. Also, Nicole, that 12,000 steps line was pure gold 😂
Good lord she is attractive! I guess so are you Josh
Nichole would low-key be a great wedding planner.
Lol. Our wedding had like 7 different appetizers that I wanted to make by hand myself. 😅 My MIL talked me off the ledge and took over. We had a very lovely BBQ bar and I was just the bride as I should have been. Lmao.
Dude, make it a collab, call a bunch of cooking YouTubers and tell them they can make content out of it 😜
Crazy idea: Josh challenges Gordon Ramsey to culinary combat with the stakes being that if Josh wins Gordon caters the wedding. That'd make some compelling content.
I feel connected to Josh spiritually in my cooking with the always on high thing. Making a sauce? Frantically stir it until your arm cramps while shuffling it off the burner every now and then, don't turn down the heat. If you're not sweating a little did you even really cook?
Creep by radiohead I agree epic first dance song
These two are too adorable.
I’ve heard there’s this great caterer in your area called Mythical Kitchen they can probably accomplish your whole menu 😂
🎉😂
this is like adhd on steroids!!!
What the heck happened to the meek shy Chef Lily?
Having only gotten married a couple months ago, I can say with confidence that planning is only stressful if you make it stressful. Don’t try to get everything done all at once and don’t set your expectations of what YOU want TOO high, emphasis on “you” and “too” in this context. Compromise and allow yourself to feel disappointed in not being able to have everything be exactly how you want it, but enjoy it nonetheless! I’m sure you’ll have an amazing wedding, good luck!
She’s literally the cutest ever😂😂Josh how did you pull her???🩷jk ily guys
Im sorry, POUGHKEEPSIE??? What are the chances that the mythical kitchen shouts out where im from?!?
Get a room!  You two are freekin' adorable!
This is the best advice I can give about a wedding... DON'T DO IT!!! - No just kidding. In all seriousness, weddings are so overdone that all it does is add more stress to a stressful day, week, month. I assure you, the overwhelming majority of people will not (including the bride and groom) remember what the heck was served and what people thought about it, unless it's disgusting. Just plan simple foods and enjoy your day!
Since your shrimp tacos are an appetizer, make them taquitos with salsa tooters… tutors?
I want Penelope to officiate the chaotic wedding.
They should go to a Las Vegas buffet for the wedding 😂
josh would be pleased to know that the burners on my countertop stove/oven (stoven) have only one setting. I am less than pleased, since it is impossible to simmer anything for a reasonable length of time, and i am constantly burning onions.
The System of a Down line was absolutely perfect
Okay, low-key…genius ideas…if waiters aren’t walking around my wedding like Texas De Brazil waiters serving picanha, sausage, and other crazy food…I don't want it 😂
Two caterers or a chef’s pot luck❤❤❤🎉
I always assume when mythical kitchen goes for long breaks that Josh and Julia are celebrating their wedding, I hope that it happens soon! But also definitely play an acoustic version of toxicity that would be amazing.
I think mythical kitchen catering Josh's wedding would be amazing.
Josh is a great funny guy so I’m glad for him. But man I do anything for a girl as beautiful as Julia
If they weren’t already guests, it’d be great for Mythical Kitchen to cater Josh & Julia’s wedding. Just a livestream of the kitcheneers struggling to make all 85 items on their ideal menu for 200+ guests. It’d be so entertaining 😊
The wedding should just be a Last meal (featuring. The fiancé) , So Mythical Kitchen can cater it, and then it is a business expense as well. (It would literally be your "last meal" as Fiancé and Fiancée)
Them not being able find a caterer is understandable but also the solution is kinda given to them in the rejection letter. It is expensive, but separate kitchens taking on shorter menus, independently, at the same event allows for expectations to be met on more fronts.
It would be amazing if Gordon Ramsey did the wedding!
If you dont play I'm A Believer by Smash Mouth after the big kiss, you aren't getting the most out of the wedding
Boooooooooooo
Fiancée*
I think they think they’re cute and quirky but I’ve never seen a more “pick me” couple in my life
A couple who belts together (karate and otherwise, look at their matching belts) stays together. Josh would never go full Ned. And I stand by that. I’m excited to see where this goes. These two are a future power couple I can just smell it.
Sounds like you need help planning the reception, not the wedding. Go sunset renaissance for the wedding (one of you in a suit of armor, one of you dressed as a princess, or a combination of both, you all pick) then for the reception you can transition to international food/ music festival with different areas representing different food/ music/ alcohol from around the world. Just my two cents tho'.
So Bachlor/Bachlorette party in New Orleans. Wedding in California with food trucks or stalls served carnival style (maybe state fair/circus theme with games and shows to walk around with food during cocktail hour) - different styles of food for each course, 2-3 options for each part of the wedding (Cocktail hour, main course, dessert/after party snacks). Don't forget after-party snacks. Biggest hit I've seen at a wedding was when pizza was delivered after the cake was cut. People went mad for it. Nobody ate cake.
I’m new to this channel .. i always thought josh was apart of the 🌈 community 😅 guess I thought wrong ❤they are so cute together
Weren't we told the last girlfriend was perfect in every way?
idk what to comment
Two chaotic good people getting married is crazy 😂
Josh coming with the dwight schrute haircut 😂
Just find a caterer that doesn't know it's for a wedding and DONT TELL THEM. Prices get insanely turned up for weddings, like 100% price increases
Hurry up and marry that girl!!! 🙏💪🏼
You know you are looking at a power couple, when you wouldn't mind being either party. Jay-Z and Beyonce who? Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively who?... Okay maybe on or just below the level of Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively.
Lily has certainly become more comfortable on camera.  She is hilarious.
Two words my beautiful siblings: Taco Truck!
The way she looks at Josh makes me feel like she fell in love with him all over again several times throughout this video
I'm gonna cry i love watching all of my favorite youtubers grow and evolve into having these beautiful and healthy lives <3 It's what they all deserve, especially Josh! I'm so excited for you both! You guys are honestly adorable together!
Why was Josh's Lil Jon "yeah" so good in the beginning lol
I don’t know why I assumed that Josh’s fiance would be like a calm person, kinda like the opposite of Josh….no they are just both on 10 all the time lol
I've actually attended a wedding at the Vegas Taco Bell Cantina, it honestly wasnt terrible and Julia would get a hot sauce bouquet.
I feel like I'm losing my mind. Aren't they already married?
Sorry to be pedantic, but in the title it should be "Fiancée." In French the gender is a part of the language, so by just using "Fiancé" the implication is that she's a man (basically like using masculine pronouns for her)
Congratulations you 2 and I think that y'all should video the wedding, peace and blessings always ❤
Bacon, shrimp, oyster -  Certainly they can get a little more treif food in there to balance out the matzoh ball soup.
After getting married I realized that all the stress and planning and money you put into it doesn't matter. Idk why it's become so engrained in us to want to please everyone else at our own weddings but nothing else matters on that day but you two.
Y'all are so cute!!! All I'm gonna say is that maybe the mythical kitchen could provide the food for your wedding. Edit: real talk though, just have a restaurant provide food for your wedding. My cousin did and I ended up going home with a whole tin foil tray worth of Alfredo pasta because there was so much left over.
I actually did get married in a Taco Bell
Julia for your bachelorette party if you and your girls have the money travel to NYC, stay at SOJO spa and hotel across the bridge in edgewater NJ and see a Broadway show and drag show in NYC. That's what we did for mine and it was the most amazing time
I bartended my wedding because the original bartender had something to do with his daughter, why not cook for your wedding
With all the food they're planning for their wedding... they need to provide cots in a quiet room for everyone to take naps afterwards.
Why did they put rosy cheeks on the thumbnail? Odd decision
Since no one is giving food recommendations... I'll give one that i just ate the other day and it was amazing!   Great appetizer as well.   I made homemade creamy hummus( skins removed is a MUST, with lemon, tahini, sea salt and garlic, and ice cubes) sprinkled with cumin, paprika and olive oil. In the middle, I topped it with fried ground venison( could use beef too), added bit of feta and garnished with parsley and pomegranate arils. It was stunning. Eaten with homemade Turkish bazlamas. ( Or you can use pitas). Try it- you won't hate it.
Julia looks like Kristen Bell, super adorable! Congrats to these two cuties
As someone who has been happily married TWICE (Briefly), I can tell you... Don't overthink the food.  People will not remember the food.  They will remember the party, the dress and the AWFUL speeches.  Get after it!
She has definitely picked up some of Josh's chaotic energy 😂❤
I don't know what to comment 23:12 help us
Gross
Y'all should ask Trevor to make the cake!
I’m only halfway through this video but I just needed to say omg this is SO chaotic and I hope the wedding has just as much energy 😅 I’m here for it
16:57  😂 have a good wedding
suspicious bit of pink eye going on there mate  :D :D great video
fun fact her name is just actually fiance
The menu seems a bit... much. People just needs a few appetizers and a cake.
Josh... about 3 years ago I told my ex that you would be the next old spice model in about 3 years and i seem to have gotten an influx of old spice ads and i cant help but feel like an opportunity has been missed...
WTF IS GOING ON AHSFAKALDFGAKALALSASDFGHJK
JOSH WAS IN SOUTH AFRICA/IS SOUTH AFRICAN BUT DIDN'T DO AN SA FOOD TOUR? I'm mad.
I was hoping we would get to see you two together again and it wasnt disappointing. Please make julia a regular when she has time. I dont really care for weddings, but i would pay to watch this one.
It doesn't help with the menu, but I wanted to point out that Jason Kelce is about to have a whole bunch more free time, and I think he'd deliver one hell of a wedding speech.
Josh, I recommend you do a hibachi reception where you and Julia go to each table, talk with the guests and cook them appetizers and entertain at the same time. That way you can cook, see everyone at the wedding and everyone gets to try some of your delicious food. Main meal should be left to caters though so you can enjoy the night.
NGL...a Vegas Elvis chapel wedding with a reception at the Taco Bell Cantina would be straight fire.
0:17: 👰 Josh and his fiancée discuss creating their dream wedding menu and the process of finalizing it for caterers. 3:37: 🍳 Cooking together for wedding planning stress relief and chipotle salsa making. 6:31: 🍽 Couple prepares wedding menu and discusses wedding details while cooking. 9:50: 👰 Josh and fiancé prepare for their wedding with friends, discussing bachelorette parties and wedding vibes. 12:51: 🍽 Planning the wedding menu with favorite food items and memories. 16:39: 👰 Wedding chaos ensues as the flower girl interrupts the cooking session, questioning the need for flowers and the legitimacy of weddings. 20:24: 🍽 Wedding planning and food tasting with mixed opinions and playful banter.
Is it just me or does Lilly always play a drunk distraction in every episode where she is a distracting person?
Lily really has become an MVP of Mythical Kitchen. 🤣
Noooooo Josh is like the pool boy in my imagination he is always single 😂 I can't look 🫣
Get married at my house in New England. I don't own it, and it's got a pond behind it.
Yeah this is chaotic af for the morning, sincerely gl planning lmaoooo. Congrats
Holy moly!  She did the knife hand in the 1st minute!!  She means business 😅
this is the joy i needed this morning, thanks y'all 🫶🏼
You should get the chefs from Sorted and the non-Josh chefs from Mythical to team up to cater your wedding
As someone who plays music at a lot of weddings in new york/new jersey, this is 100% accurate recreation lol
Keep it simple.  My entire dream wedding budget will go to hire Young the Giant as the wedding band 😂😂
Fiancée is the correct spelling for girl
id love to help plan the wedding, i like planning things, but im not in cali
I wish I could plan your wedding for you, that would be so fun
Cant relate lonley AF
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Not gonna lie I’ve been to a New Orleans wedding and it was a tooting blast. Shrimp boil near the water and a band. Wedding done!
These two are such a cute couple, I am so happy Julia came back on the channel.
dude 1000% needs a new wife lol
they’re so perfect together omg!!
I love Josh, I just hope he hasn't dug a tunnel underneath GMM
Yeeeees please.. let us see ur taped wedding pleeease I don’t care if it’s full of ads just upload it somewhere when u two get married 😊❤❤❤ I hope it’s sponsored by mythical and that u guys get the free sponsored meal catering of ur dreams
I just wanna see that poor young girl have a nice quinceañera. Seriously I hope Josh and Julia have a fantastic wedding. As far as things you should have there, I would suggest an officiant and a marriage license so you are able to be legally married. That typically helps. The rest is just a party for your friends and family and you can make that look however you want and can afford. Mazel tov!
Josh isn’t the husband to peel your oranges, he’s the husband to explain why you should be eating the peel.
I think @sorted would be ablw to help cater the wedding!
"Fiancé" takes an additionnal "e" when used for a woman. Fiancée.
The bits were not it
honestly aside from my wife walking down the aisle the only other thing from my wedding I remember was how good the food was. Food is the biggest thing in a wedding no joke.
Imagine marrying a guy who is buff, knows how to cook, and is funny has heck. You didn't get the bag. You got the whole bank.
1. Josh's family is from South Africa?!  2. I've never seen another person who was so perfect for Josh 😂
Wow...this is just full on brain melt lol
One thing's sure - no one stays hungry on that wedding.
Is Penelope taking on new clients? Asking for a friend.
She has the squarest shoulders ever!! lol
They are so perfect for each other. I am so happy that Josh found his person 🤍😊
A wedding isn't a marriage.  My recommendation is, have a small wedding and follow up with a party later. Aside from that, these 2 are fun together
No wonder you cant find catering guys
What do you call the fabric of Josh’s pants or just the pants? They look so cool and classy
"You can't multitask, this is your job" 😂. May you guys get your dream menu and have as much fun on your wedding day as you guys did during this episode of filming.
Pure chaos but thriving ❤
Lilys accent is bomb
Peri Peri Chicken is also very popular in England where it's called a "cheeky Nandos"
Josh congrats on Becoming Gordon Ramsey’s Idiot Sandwich
chaos couple!
The distractions took a lot away from the video just have the couple
Wtf Josh looks so similar to Andy Samberg .
Mom can we get a Gordon Ramsey? No son we have Gordon at home. Gorden at home: Josh
If this is not a poster for a ideal 60 years strong couple I don’t know what is good luck with the wedding 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
"This is my quinceañera! This is MMMMMY quinceañera! This IS my quinceañera."
They look and act like they were made for each other. Love seeing relationships like this ❤
Just go for burgers and dogs and getting married on a pontoon boat on a lake. Who doesn't love a fun lake day?
Keep hunting for someone to cater. It'll work out, I'm sure. You should get what you want on the day you get married.
9:27 Best moment of Lily 2024
Go to the courthouse get married then have a mythical barbecue. Make sure Trevor and chase are there. Your welcome
I’ve never seen Josh this comfortable with physical contact and proximity. Usually he goes out of his way to avoid even being next to someone.
You can tell Josh really loves her: he's wearing slacks instead of jorts for this episode!
I live in San Felipe, Baja. You should just do our Main street and malecon for your food
Now that you are Gordon Ramsay's son, ask him for advice. Maybe you can get som family discounts 😉
I'm so happy for Josh. First Ramsey, and he found someone who matches his energy. That's so cool.
Julia is almost as chaotic as Josh, and they couldn’t be more perfect for each other. Also Nicole might have found a new career as a wedding planner if things at Mythical don’t work out. 😄
With that giant menu...it might be cheaper to rent out one of those fancy buffets in Vegas that have a whole staff that are used to making multiple different kinds of dishes lol
I hope everyone in the comments to find a woman to look at them the same way Julia does with Josh.
finally, this was such a long time coming :3
I will cook your dream menu, exactly as you guys dream it
Seafood Tex Mex. If they went with that as the base it sounds like that would hit a fair amount.
She’s suppose to roast Josh’s hair…. You’re not 24 dude…
This is gonna be the most chaotic wedding ever, and I'm fully here for it 😂😂
I have a more dumb idea ask Daddy Gordon to find someone who’s willing to cook for Josh’s wedding 😂
I loved when Julia was on here last! They go together so well!
I hope you two have a great wedding and even better marriage but my experience is that even the cheapest wedding without guests that cost us just 150  bucks (3500CZK to be exact) in total was amazing and it's a good way to avoid stress induced conflict if necessary. 🙂Still happily married years later even with a cheapo wedding.
Definitely film it as a mythical production
Creep as a first song is so iconic
"Creep" by radiohead as your first song... that made me cough my lunch all over the table!
Sounds like you two need to invite a gaggle of food trucks to the wedding to handle that menu
Josh at the reception: "Everyone's got two things in common. We've all gotta eat, and we're all gonna die. Wai—"
I don't appreciate Josh's hairstyle
Now that Josh is the adopted child of Gordon Ramsay.. will you be inviting him to the wedding?
Legit, saucy carrots looks delicious.
My brothers first dance was legitimately the song adam sandler sings to drew Barrymore on the plane in the wedding singer. The one where Billy effing idol helps stop her from becoming Julia Gulia ..
Go to Vegas. We started planning our wedding and when the cost ballooned my wife suggested “let’s just go to Vegas”. 8 years ago my wife and I got married there and it was fantastic. Family flew in and everyone had a great time. I have a friend that lives there so we shipped some supplies down ahead of time. Super stress free in comparison. Also is a good excuse to return to Vegas.
Don't worry about timelines. If you're in love, that's all that matters.
I can't express enough how happy this made me
Sounds like... an impossible task... Robert Irvine should cater the wedding.
So, Josh just decided to go full "A Night at the Roxbury". Well, that's certainly a choice.
yes I rewatch their first vid to get some faith in romance back all the time lol! 💜💜💜 they are couple goals and she is such a catch.
As someone from the south, Lily nailed the role.
JJs kitchen coming to a street corner near you😊😅💖👏 🍽️
I hope you guys produce 5 children and raise them in the Jewish tradition and one of them becomes an important rabbi in the community
Nah I refuse to believe Josh is straight
They got engaged over a year ago. They aren’t married yet??
Have you considered sourcing different food trucks? They can individually be responsible for all the different food groups.
Josh has pants on, I 100% believe he only puts on pants for Julia.
Camera ready couples make me cringe.
Matching themed undershirts for the groomsan. The groom should be Superman, or Ironman! Thats a cool photo opportunity.
you can make the shrimp on large baking pans for mass production , peri peri chicken cook it the day before in mass , day of get a double Deck Pizza Bakery Oven to glaze and char day of. i have no idea how to mass produce the carrots
She is very energetic
I always assumed he had a boyfriend
i cant deal with how cute they are im gonna puke LMAO
Tears to my eyes :')
Best part is that u can tell non of the non food stuff was planned
honestly, for that elaborate menu, y'all should try an indian wedding caterer
Acoustic SOAD would be phenomenal for a wedding.   Wife and I did VSQ covers for ours during dinner.
Definitely put the wedding on the channel and turn it into a business expense!
PLEASE keep bringing her on the show we love the chaotic couple energy!
Those two are perfect together
more Lily
you fit so well, its like high energy meets high energy
Why not higher a bunch of food trucks and do the reception In a parking lot? You could have the huge variety and actually have people who specialize in these dishes 🤔
Lmao I feel like Josh kept this video calmer for his fiancee lmao but this is hilariously awesome
Oh you better video the wedding for us! We love you! Weve seen you grow a chanel like a rock star! And this adorable angel has flown in to save you! You better show this wedding!
I was wondering if his gf found his mouth eating annoying, but she is one too so it doesn't matter lol
I love their chemistry so much. ❤️❤️
south africa… oh…
I dont know what to comment!
"Hi, I'm Josh and my last meal as a single man would be...."
WHAT if: Gordon Ramsay steps up... and says I got it. Wrangling a crew of some of the best Chefs... doing Josh & Julia's dream menu... including the inspired by Chefs doing their dish.  Of course, the last course, would be Gordon's grilled cheese.
You two are the perfect culinary couple!
Couples that look like brother and sister always last
it keeps getting more and more chaotic as time goes. oml. 🤣
God, I love Lily. She is so cute.
Josh would be the guy to cater his own wedding
Bachelorette party at next good mythical evening.
Cool. Josh is marrying Stevie. That tracks.
I think the guys from Sorted should make your wedding menu, that would be really fun
This was basically just a recreation of the Christmas episode of the 2nd season of “The Bear,” and no one can convince me otherwise. UNABATED CHAOS. 🤌🤌🤌
I haven't even watched and I know it's going to be my favoriiiite! They are so sweet together!
This doesn’t feel like content, it feels like a cry for help.
3:15 I’m a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I was about to critique Josh’s technique for palm heel striking garlic and then Julia’s like “I was a black belt in karate” and I was like YEAH BLACK BELT CLUB WE KNOW HOW TO PALM HEEL STRIKE BETTER THAN ANYONE. Good on you, girl - show him how it’s done!  Also congratulations to you two! I hope you continue to bring love and happiness to one another.
This is the first time I've seen Susan, and she is adorable.  Way to go, Josh!
That was a clean lil John impression at the beginning ngl😂
The first thing.  Very entertaining!  But hot dayum the most important thing is that this just proves so much that they are perfect for each other.  So effin adorbs!!  ❤🎉❤🎉
2019, Josh's prospective fiancee checklist: must have stage presence
DUDE WHAT IS THAT HAIR! Xd
Food Trucks and a group of circus performers. I think that's the best solution.  You get married at night and just have a circle of food trucks with their head lights on.
Who titled this? She ain't got no name?
Damn Josh is taken😂. I cant have anything   Lol j.k
man i love Josh and his fiancee, Fiancé.
I vote eloping at the taco bell cantina, my dudes. Wedding planning is trying to end me and I might do the same thing 😂
I can't believe her name is fiance
It is awesome that Josh and Julia found each other. Such a beautiful and goofy couple! I hope they have as much fun off camera. Their energy is intense and very entertaining.
🇿🇦hot damn for the Peri Peri, pap and chakala! So interesting that Josh has family from my home! More than willing to plan this wedding guys. In South Africa. If you can supply the birria peppers I would deadass cook and plan everything. 😢
Why does Josh look like Leon Kennedy? Gonna cook for the Ganados?
They are perfect together but she’s definitely overcompensating for the video. I’d be nervous too!
Lmao! I love y'all!!!
Man winning in life 🙌
I’m not saying Josh and Julia should have a Mythical Wedding, but I’m not saying they shouldn’t either.
Exactly why foodies shouldn't get together!!! Lmao!
So happy for you ❤
Josh is such a lucky guy. Not only is Julia dropdead GORGEOUS she matches the chaos beautifully... Or at least puts up with it like an angel😂❤
This gave me a headache.
Pure wholesome chaos and I’m so here for it
Josh slowly morphing into a full on Dad.
If the mythical team doesn’t make this wedding catering dreams come true then I’ll unsubscribe
penelope has gotta be a recurring character lmaoo
Mythical Cuteness Overload
Isn't that supposed to be "fiancée"?
Josh is a chain and a couple of inches of neckline away from being that dwayne the rock johnson meme
Nicole has missed her calling as a wedding planner
They look so happy 😭💖 their vibes are immaculate
josh i love you
Robyn Adele Anderson does a nice Toxicity, just saying. 🤷🤣
I love that mrs mythical chef Josh looked at her boobs when he said distractions...
man they are both so frantic, I love it!
Aww, this is so adorable I'm gonna throw up
That adderall energy. LAWD
Josh is still dressing like Gordon Ramsay
im so early and congrats to you both
congrats josh and julia, hope you two have the best wedding day ever
Wahhh how cute 😭😭🙏🙏
The tucked in shirt tells me Josh will have a great family. Those 2 are so great together.
Lil jon ' yeah' is the best yeah!
lucky number 7
Congratulations Josh and Julia, I can’t wait for the upcoming wedding and the little Jr mints you two will have ❤I really want to come to their wedding ❤
I didn't know that Josh has a Fiancé! Well, i sure do now. But congratulations on the engagement!
My daily dose of kitchen choas
You guys are so cute!!! Congrats to you both!!!
SO CUTE!😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤
Freesh
Excited for this, and weird to be early enough to show no views!
I love these videos!!
First
