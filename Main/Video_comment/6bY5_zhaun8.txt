Thank you all SO much for watching + supporting our very first reality series on this channel #NikiandGabiJerseyShore 🌊⛱ We’re currently in the process of planning our next series. Comment below where you think we should travel to next! ⬇️
what i love about the conversation on the beach is that they didn’t push Gabi to speak they gave her space to talk and cry without being pushed and they made her feel comfortable and loved and even though sometimes this friend group is toxic this moment was just beautiful
13:56 excuse mee?

i realized that its not just Niki and Gabi that are growing...are whole generation is growing..social media is an illusion people want u too see what they want u to see...pls spend time with your loved ones and remind them u love them...cause u never know what tomorrow brings.
when gabi spoke up it made me cry bc she rlly is trying and she is being so responsible, this is the gabi i love honest, and it’s ok to sad bc i know that not everyone as it together, but gabi is doing so good and being so mutate love u gabi
We love you Gabi.

I love this❤❤
Ngl I love that Gabi is opening up, and that Niki is listening to her, kinda
Keep them coming!! Would love to see you guys come visit Italy 💕
Who is the friend?
14:24 Idk why I thought this was funny. Niki puckering her lips to blow a kiss or try to give one but Nate turns away from her. You can also see it at 14:29 😁
Damn why did that get a lot more deeper then I thought
I love you❤️❤️❤️ and this show, pleas do more videos like this🥰
Aww I love how Collin is there for Gabi
1:40 Who's the girl in the very back talking to Mike?
Jersey shore.... PLEASEEEE
WHAT IS THIS SHIT AND WHY IS IT IN MY RECOMMENDED
When Gabi said she would even think she would see her birthday it made me cry bcz i have been through their cahnnel for soooooo longggggg and made me hurt she those thoughts cuz she means a lot to me
i love these shows so much u have to do more.
I love these videos:)  Thx so much u guys, Gabi best wishes for u! ✨🤍✨
Potentially the best series yet. You guys know how to provide ❤️🤘
I would love more epiosodes but I love your unscripted reality show
I hope she wasn’t talking about Allie 🥴
Gabi I feel you but whenever I’m sad and I have mascara I’m so scared if showing emotions cuz I thing ima get a stain
I just turned 26. I never thought I’d make it to 26. The thing that has kept me here is not only my dog who was my daddy’s before his passing - but also just hearing him in my head tell me “Just keep going baby. You gotta keep going soldier.” Which is what he told me the time I told him I felt like I couldn’t do *this* anymore. I’m glad I had that talk with him so I know what he’d tell me now, years later.
Yes I wanna see more
This shit looks so fake

Man when Gabi talked about her struggle with mental health I started crying because I understand what she went through so well. But I loved this one that they did, love how it’s not scripted.
Y'all need to go to Bali
I lovee it
Am so sad this is so short🥲
niki and gabby take on the uk ..... pleaseeeee!!!!
Ok this trip was waaaaayyyyy tooo short on camera 😢 I usually love the episode vlogs but this one seems a little forced for some reason. Like when Rachel was talking about the friend you couldn’t name. I miss the way awesomeness tv did it…. But I definitely love this style and this you guys should continue the good work!💞
Go to theraphy people, is good for your mental health!
You should do the country like Kansas or Oklahoma and it could be like country get away
I have watched every freaking video you both have made since the very beginning and I feel like I know you both so hearing Gabi open up about her mental health and explaining to everyone how she didn’t feel like she would see herself at 26 breaks my heart :( but I’m also so happy she is opening up and I (as well as others) has seen major growth in Gabi and Niki! I love you both
We love you Gabi!!! We also love you Niki!
Please please please do more!!! I love watching y’all ❤️❤️❤️
I wonder who Gabi’s friend is that didn’t say bye
I would love to see this again 💗💗💗💗💕💞

Wait can you guys please take on Toronto!
Niki just looks absolutely stunning! She’s literally glowing
Obsessed with Niki’s energy!!!
Pls make more content like this all love and support 🤍🤍

Seeing Gabi cry and say all that made my heartbreak 💔
We love you gab ❤ I will always support you both, whatever Happens.
Ofcourse Rachel is a Gemini LOL😅
I LOVE THIS REALITY SERIES

Lmao was not expecting Collin at the end. Loved it. Definitely more series like this!!!
This was awesome
Bring these back
I loved this episode niki and gabi finally not fighting but getting along and niki listening to gabi and not judging her and making this about her. Whoever gabi friend was is an asshole on her birthday too. Also when gabi cried about her not wanting or thinking she’d make it to her birthday was very touching I have had many years like that so I understand how hard it can get and be.
I loved it , and I really love nikki's energy and vibe
Q
When Gabi started crying it made me cry! ♥️ ILY NIKI AND GABI!!!! I want more!!!!!
Love it please do more trips 😍
You should do Niki & Gabi take Vegas
PLEWSE GO TO VEGAS!!!!!
Love it!!!
i feel like they were talking about Ali
Gabi made me cry when she said she was putting on a fake smile and she didn't think she would make it to her birthday I'm 15 and feel this way 24/7
Once covid allows I would love to see them come to the UK and do like a roadtrip around it
I love this reality show series! You guys should definitely make another one♥️
start a season 2 But longer
Love this
i love how collin is always by gabi’s side
Ok but now I’m confused cause in this video Rachel seems sensible 😭😂
PLEASE DO ANOTHER ONE, THANK YOU 💅
guys where is ally
Yes this was amazing I loved how real it is🥰 Gabi your amazing we love you so much 💞 Niki your just awesome and your whole vibe is just 🤌
this video made me very positive and its so amazing gabi is being so brave 🤍
people in your life are for a reason, a season or a lifetime     - RACHEL
We love you gabi❤️
we love you and you are amazing for what you do <3
Anyone else feel an attachment to these girls. Like if Gabi went through it went break us all as well as her close friends?
Ok but there style 😍✨
More and more seasons please!!!!!!!🤩🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏
Obsessed please do more 💕💕
Niki should take her own advice to Gabi and dump Rachel lmao
I would love to see Niki and Gabi Taking Hawaii with some cool views and activities!⛱⛱⛱
That guy standing speechless while niki and rachel and the other girl are discussing what happened to gabi is just funny
A fight about not saying goodbye?? Wow Gabi's "friend" must be really petty...
Please do another trip!! I love this so much more than the scripted shows
Rachel kinda gives me Jules vibes from Euphoria
This mini series made me really who I am. It's not just about having fun but it's also about opening your heart and sharing the difficulties you have been struggling with and the emotions. I grew up watching Niki and Gabi and it has been a long road. I like how they were bullied but still never gave up in there life and kept working hard to get to the journey there here today. I hope this series never ends because it has been a journey that I'll never forget.
I need more episodes
Moreeee!!!
Collin at the end😭😭😭😭
This is an amazing video! Adulting is scary, so thank you very much for sharing your journey with us 💖
Maybe on a future trip you should visit Seattle? It would be such a vibe 💜 especially during the fall and or winter💜
My mom came home on my birthday July 10 on hospice she died 8 days later..  life is very unexpected

Image if niki and gabi went to the UK  now that probably be Newcastle is such nice than London but that more posher yh they should go to UK

There is a quote that says if your not losing friends then your not growing.

My guess is the friend was either emelyne or ally
LOVE these SO much!!!
Definitely would love to see more trips, I love seeing the real relationships between Niki and Gabi, Niki and Collin, Gabi and Aly (missed her here), Niki and Jesse. I would love to see Gabi and Nate's bond too now that the girls are close. Also, what happened to Xena? I feel like I haven't heard her mentioned in foreverrr
Niki using rare beauty living for that

Absolutely love these! The fact that both girls are so open about their mental health is  just amazing. ❤
This series has been my favorite yet because it felt like it was the most genuine and cuz they showed real life problems without the "glamour" or "drama", this was real life shit 💜

omg its about ally, there was a shot where they were singing happy birthday to the girls and she stopped singing and looked like she didnt want to be there.
Ok, but doesn’t everyone want to see CAPTAIN REBECCA IN AUSTRALIA .
You guys should do Niki and Gabi take Big Bear!
I really hope it's not Allie... On a different note - I was hospitalized for trying to end my life about 3 weeks ago. I know how Gabi is feeling
Love yall opening up it just shows us that everyone has there own struggles and loved this mini seric
YESSSSSS IT CAME
Can you do a longer show I’m so sad it’s already over  it was fun being able to look forward to somthing
Always love watching these series and was totally sad that it ended. You guys should totally do another trip series but longer and maybe going somewhere overseas when it's   safe too would be cool!

you should keep doing a show like this i love it
I love how open Niki & Gabi choose to be with us. It just makes me realize how similar everybody goes through things. Like being in your 20s is just so weird because you notice how your friends or people around you are all in different chapters and phases in their lives- and in a way it is comforting to see even my fav youtubers have experienced this. & this is why I love the show and Niki/Gabi💛
This has to be about her best friend Allie lmfao so obvious
We love you gabi
Niki and Gabi walking down the road with their future husbands is EVERYTHING!!!😍😍😍
I LOVED THIS PLS MAKE MORE <333
Y’all should do this againnn !!

People are in you're life for a reason, season or lifetime. A relationship Is a two way street. I've always thought Gabi was extra but really... She has her Shit together. I'm ☹️ for her. But hope it was a positive lesson learned. Not everyone will mesh with you
This was kinda boring lol
I loved this definitely should do more!
Collin at the end LMAO
We need a Niki and Gabi take NYC !!!
We love you gabi 💕
DO LONGER TRIPS AND EPISODES!!
Love love this season please please make another season anywhere I loved it ❤️❤️
gabi nd her fiancé’s relationship is so cuye
I wish Rachel would shut up when someone else is talking. Gabi JUST started to speak up and Rachel’s interrupting and making it about her like come on dude 🙄🙄🙄

Just hearing what Gabi has gone through with the situation that she through it made me cry and just hearing that she struggled with her mental health it pulled on my heart strings because I'm going through the same thing... so I completely understand where she is coming from. I love this show and I enjoyed it so much.

We love you Gabi 💘

I am so sorry Gabi it is hard t to loose a friend a little bit more
Yes i liked it would love to see more episodes in different places
Protect your energy. It wasn’t meant to be with that friend
Loved Rachel in this episode x
I can see why Niki is attracted to Rachel, she's so well spoken and smart, and the way she stands her ground and holds herself with such confidence, it's really attractive.
if it's allie :( i hope in time you will collide again but you are brave and enough gabi
Who else has been checking everyday just hopeing that this is here so I can watch this x
Yes I these shows
after everything Gabi has speaks up to Or opened up her feelings, i totally understand everything she gone through and she’s not alone, we all been like that way and it not really easy, but doesn’t mean we should gave up everything, we can keep being survivor and fight for it! and I begged you guys to do Vegas!!! it would be iconic! 😩
I love how straight up you are with us. Please keep doing this <3
Yessss do a longer trip, I love them!!!
I also didn’t think I would have the courage to battle through my mental health and see 35. I had my bday in February. Anyone feeling this way hold on. Reach out to someone. Keep fighting one day at a time. ❤️
Your guys best “reality” episodes!!
Team niki and gabi 🥰🥰🥰🥰😇💕😍

When Gabi talked about how she didn’t think she would make it to her birthday I started crying because I literally feel like that rn and I just wanted to say I love you Gabi 💗
So who is the friend????
I feel like the person who left was Allie. In the second episode when everyone was singing happy birthday to niki and gabi she was just like looking at some man and not even singing. She looked like she didn't want to be there.
protect n&g they are angels
i like this gabi. i really like this gabi.
Gaby trying to push out them tears 🤣🤣
#weloveugabi <3
Aww Poor Gabi :( I'm so glad she had her friends and Niki to talk to about this  <3  Mental health is so important and  I'm very glad they draw attention to it.
