You're so honest bless you girl plus you're absolutely gorgeous love your fashion style
I appreciate your transparency
Thank you for this Patricia. Especially as a woman of color we are often fought to toughen up and keep it to yourself and keep that mask on.   We don’t communicate like we should.   Relationships have been crazy as well as EVERYTHING ELSE 2020/2021 threw at us.   I’ve been trying to break that down in my relationships and fully communicate and heal.  That has been both amazing and so hard and my partner and I have been on a roller coaster but it has helped so much. Fully opening up and putting it in the table.
You are stunning in this video and thank you for sharing ❤ 😊 💕.
Saw a blogger discussing your "issue" with MODE and the 4 businesses. (Specifically...Non payment) PD. You should sue "them" 3rd party: under the Contract (Third Party) Rights Act 1999 or by virtue of a collateral warranty between the professional and the third party. Suing you? Facts!!! If you didn't get paid...you didn't get paid.  3rd party or not.  Not defamation.  Sue "them" PD. Then "they" should sue Mode.  Good luck!
That top omg is so bloody beautiful 🤯
Thanks for sharing will keep you and your family in prayer
Hang in there Patricia 😍😍😍
This Pandemic, QUARANTINE and the other negative things that's happening right now I'm struggling so much! I'm keeping my faith in God and that's what's keeping me going
You are a beautiful woman and I just found your content. Stay strong and lean on the Lord. This is the time for you and your husband to pray 🙏🏾 together. We don't all have it together and that is ok. Because of this pandemic it is very hard on people. I wish you the best as your content grow.🙏🏾
On a light note:  I've been watching you since the first videos and seen all of your life experiences and beauty journey, you just messed my head UP with the revelation that your surname is NOT Bright😮
12.35 the most relatable thing ever :( womanhood is crazy
Thank you 🙏🏽 for being honest and real about yourself. There’s no one ☝️ person in this world that’s perfect. You have this radiance about yourself that’s naturally authentic and that says a lot about your character. Keep doing you and God bless 🙏🏽
you always keep it real P, we love you! 💗
James 4:8
Hello hello 👋 Patricia been following you for years and I must say I see no reason you need to start including your marriage issues in your videos.  I just feel that has taken so many marriages online for downhill.
Your amazing
Love this. No you don't have t be sharing all your personal life with hubby and you on screen. Keep your cards close because yes no matter if you do good or not so good people will things to say ans some of it not so nice. So this change is good. I watched you on and off from before you got engaged and you have come a very long way and helped aot people launch out in the vlog world so its all good. You are human and things do happen that can sometimes be beyond our control.  Agreed motherhood changes alot and having 2 girls myself with co,plications in both pregnacies I can relate.  Weare strong and get through so much. Let me stop now. Looking forward to your new journey. xx
I love seeing the real side of Patricia, so relateable. 💕
There’s nothing wrong with having boundaries. I would say that you showing your birthing of Grace and saying what’s on your mind, showing us your body enhancements is being very transparent! We all have ups and downs and you need to give yourself the space to go through that too. Transparency and boundaries in your professional life as an influencer need to have what you feel are best. What you need for you and Mike/ your family are yours. As a viewer for many years and being older I say you do what is truly best for you. You can always change your mind as feelings change. Positive vibes to you ✨✨
You're such a beautiful person. Alot of us can really relate to you on this level. Quarantine has brought alot out, things that have been easier to mask in the past.
So happy for you, I love your channel
Thank you for sharing. 2020 has been tough for a lot of people. You are very strong and courageous for coming out and sharing your truth for others to see. That takes courage. I found your channel when you had broken your arm. Wow, that’s amazing! Please be well and encouraged.
Thank you for opening up. I feel you needed this and it makes me so glad to know that you’re on the up! I pray for you and Mike. I hope you guys bounce back better than ever, no one is prefect but you guys deserve so much happiness. Love to the little Queens as well, they are beautiful❤️❤️ Stay strong girl!!! 🙌🏽✊🏽
I understand the struggle and your transparency is inspiring
You are very strong for sharing this!  You got this! 💕
This is why I appreciate you! Truth and transparency. Feel the fear and do it anyway honey! 🤎🤎🤎
I love the honesty in this. We need more content like this.
Hi girl i never comment your videos, but I watched a lot of them. You are beautiful and Amazing 👏 ❤ 💖 💕 ♥
I had my second baby in November tllast year, can totally relate to the poor mental health and depression.. But we have to be strong for our husband's and our kids, so we don't really get time to deal with it😢
You are so adorable 🥰 I love your honesty, humour and brightness 💓
You’re my favorite youtuber b/c you’re so honest and real ❤️
I’m a big fan but this video is a lot of talk but u ain’t saying anything 😒
You being open is the best part of everything you do. We love the REALLL
i discovered your channel for the first time when you and your husband did travel vlogs! i love that you were always yourself. even though you mentioned you dont feel like you are being your true authentic self - your personaly is so powerful and strong i honestly feel like im connecting to you by just watching your videos. i will be a loyal subscriber, feel free to share whatever you would like and feel is appropriate! i dont judge! most i will do is learn from you when it comes to mom life, relationships and work. but we all know how unexpected life is. we never know what to expect EVER. love and respect you so so so much. i could tell this is a new chapter of womanhood for you! i love that you are trying to tackle your fears. that is a skill we should all practice!
Married almost 8 years and together 15. This time has been hard on our relationship. We are holding on tho. We are all human. We get on each others nerves sometimes. Work on you and your relationship will get better.
Patricia, I never comment on YouTube videos, I usually just watch,  but I’ve been watching you since you were doing clothing hauls in your parents house and I feel like we have oddly grown up together. I love this video and the “real” you that you are letting us have a small window into, just know we are always rooting for you!
I think you’re awesome.  I enjoy watching you and I pray the best for you and your family.  Hi from Houston TX🙋🏾‍♀️
She’s so real and I LOVE IT !
I love this transparency & substance. I stopped watching a while ago because I felt like the channel was lacking depth. Thank you, in this video you're talking about some really valuable topics.
No need to try to fit in, God designed you to stand out!  This “forced Sabbatical” has done a number on people around the world! You’re handling it all with such grace. What a blessing
I love the transparency!! I’ve been here since you were making natural hair video❤️ I wish you wellness, peace and happiness!
Thank you for sharing all of that. It was so beautiful and we all love and reapect you for it ♡
I think you are an amazing woman and you share so much already. You and your family are important, its ok to want privacy and keep some aspects to yourself. Continue to be strong, I Love this channel so much and ahhh you are awesome.
Brave of you to share all of this. You are so strong and amazing, keep your head up, things will get better.
Don’t worry you are pushing through and corset, corset, corset for the hernia。Use a post pregnancy corset.  It can work / relieve the pain to an extend as it gives support
You are the strongest person I know on YouTube. With God nothing is impossible...keep working and be positive God will do the rest❤❤  Trust the father😘
Thank you for sharing, you do a ll that you put your mind too. Love
I love how real an honest you are, and facing your fears an recognizing what you you want to improve an etc. An being more healthy
Patricia you’re really inspiring. This is powerful to share and I’m sure a lot of people are relating and experiencing mental health issues at the moment. I wish you wellness and hope the next few months are a lot better for you. X
I love you so much Patricia! You are such a strong, beautiful woman, and I can proudly say that I look up to you. I am with you 100% on this journey whether you are completely transparent with us or not. Either way, I'm staying <3
God bless you & your family.  Continue to pray and be open with God about your fears, struggles, etc.  Sending positive energy your way & hoping that you continue to speak life/positivity over any situation you face.
Thank you Patricia

Sending you lots of love and hugs❤️🤗Appreciate the honesty. Am sure you felt better and lighter. 🤗
Thanks for sharing. I was lit saying “same” for almost everything you were saying. Changes, yes! FYI I think the majority of ppl are not in shape, so I, as a viewer, wasn’t even paying too much mind to your physique. You look great. You are extremely inspirational. Thank you 😊
Patricia Bright. Let me tell you something. You do that operation and make yourself look fab, I dont care what people say, but I have watched your videos post baby, and I'm gonna say Do it! You need it, and don't need to tell us why.
🤎🤎🤎🤎
thank u for connecting deeper. we love uuuu
You are brave, smart, thoughtful and beautiful. You didn't need to share your personal life - we understand that your personal life is your own. However, I think you needed to this video for you and your process and I respect it. Keep shining queen <3
Yo, protect your peace. You got this BB
Time to pull back the veil be YOU!
Turn this blue if you love Patricia 👇
Marriage is hard and its even harder when worrying about peoples opinions. Keep your private life private and do what you have to to get back ON the right track. I pray God looks over your marriage and family life sis.
I love her like crazy. She is too honest. I don't even see the need to but u do for the sake of transparency and honesty and I will forever respect that❤❤❤❤
Honestly looking forward to the new chapter for your channel and seeing some different content. Time passes, we change and bring your true self is enough to get the peace you want ❤️
Yes!! It is strong to be soft and I love know transparent this video is!! Thank you for sharing with us 🧡
You’re children are so blessed that they have a mother that addresses mental health. When I was in my late years of high school and early years of college I took on major depression, insecurities etc. my parents basically were upset with me for feeling this way telling me it’s a sign of weakness, I need to toughen up, and I’m being selfish. Never waiting to take into consideration of my feelings. I mean I was literally suicidal but they would’ve never known because according to them I was always “wrong” for my feelings.
Real and real as can be you are x I'm ready for the new chapter. I pray that God bless and keep your family together don't give up so easily on some you've work hard and build x you've got a beautiful family😘😘😘
My whole hand can fit in my gap. I know the pain.....
We can all relate Patricia. This Pandemic really took a toll on many. Especially marriages. I know as my husband and I were at each other's necks. In the house all day, everyday!! But we worked hard and are still working thru it. I pray for you and your husband and your family.
❤️❤️❤️
Why do you have to be open to us tho. I feel like these are one of the issues that should be kept sacred and kept within marriage. Your channel isn't really about you and your hubby relationship so, you shouldn't have to tell us anything about it. All this info is not for the internet. God Bless you and you and your family
When you said your last name was not Bright, I had to laugh! I really thought your name was Bright as it fit your personality to a Tee! Thanks for being transparent...I'm here for it!!
Amazing video ❤️❤️❤️
Bless you , your husband and your beautiful children xoxo
Patricia talked about SOOO many things in the video and mentioned her marriage for 40 sec ...and thats all the comment section is.
We love you Patricia your the realest 💕
Thank you for being so open with us. It took alot of courage. You are very brave. What you said touched me alot. I have secretly been dealing with deepression on and off. I have a soft voice and bubbly personality, but i couldn't hide anymore, so i let my family know about my struggles. it felt like being naked. I have had issues with my self image and my body in particular. and you are so right looking back i realise i looked good but never loved me. I wish you all the best in this new journey, you are half way there. For you need to go through to go out. recognising , facing and being honest about where you are is the hardest thing to do. you will be alright . God bless and kkeep you and your family. you were a trigger (in a positive way) for me. It is time i loved me faults, blemishes and all. Thanks, Merci beaucoup, asante sana, eroka mano (i am being funny saying thanks in the languages i speak, english, french, swahili and luo). Any way lots of love and i am cheering you on.
Patricia, I hope that you have a chance to read my comment.  I have watched you for several years.  I am quite a bit older than you, and I remember videos of your sharing bible devotionals with the viewers.  This was way before your your having millions of subscribers.  The Lord has blessed you with a caring husband and a wonderful youtube career.  However, I noticed that with your success came less dependence and discussion of your relationship with Christ.  I suppose that is one of the dangers of success and money: pride can easily enter in, which causes strife confusion and every evil work. (James 3:16).  Patricia, if you focus on rebuilding your intimacy with  God, everything else will fall into place.  (Mathew 6:33).
Look after yourself and your family.  Blessings and positive vibes 🙏🏽.
I really hate  2020 , nothing but loss . I lost 4 people that I really care about..... and a lot of financial losses.... I can’t wait to see the back of 2020. This year has been cancelled for me
Yiu are a SWEETHEART PATRICIA 💓 og supporter 😙
God bless you and your family ❤️
You are the kind of strong woman I aspire to be. With all your transparency all I see is you as even more strong than I did before. ❤️
Thank you so much for sharing. ❤️
Your an amazing role model. Thank you.
I feel all of what your saying but what hit me the hardest was your last name wasn’t bright!! Like WHAT??? Girl I’ve been following you for 6yrs now
Keep people OUT of your marriage, it's your business, not ours.
You’re an even bigger inspiration because of this realness!
5 planets in retrograde... Alot of changes in our personal life and globally are happening.  Ends and new beginnings. Time to purge...  Wish you the best ❤️..
I don't know if you're still reading these comments. *I* appreciate your transparency and want it more. I don't! demand it, but Im impacted by seeing it. Knowing that the girl who has it "all together" is working through what you have is inspiring and an ass-kick to not just me but us who relate. I want your truth because the private victories are what fuel the public *glow-ups* and learning and seeing how you have found what balance you have, in the various parts of your life and how you move to maintain that balance without my own role model in my immediate environment is SO impactful!
I really feel for you..being on youtube and whatnot must be alot of pressure..women moms n wifes have alot of pressure as it is..its hard out here bruh and then you have to look perfect for all these platforms..because while there is love out there theres jus so much hate..and taking all that on a daily. I feel like u dont need to open up everything. U know what being married neely 12 years there are some reely lows and now looking back in glad no1 was there to know. I mean that was between me and him. Im nt trying to look perfect..just the ppl who reeeallllyyy cared may have found out..i truly being selective with ur life is ur choice..work on you on your own with the ones u love..❤️
We love u
People want to see fun and happiness because everyone has their own problems..You need to lean to your God not these people on internet..
Ahhh love ya girl, you're the freakin best!! Will always be here to support you!!
I've been here since you were britpopprincess and honestly really admire you and Mike and your knowledge as much as i really appreciate  seeing your family ..please please don't share to much protect your relationship and family first b4 all things. Id rather see and know your marriage last and those babies have a intact family and the content stays the same with some clips of them every now and than you over share and hear it ends like all the others on YouTube.
My favorite!!
Please, take care of yourself pat. :(
Whatever you do, don't let them use a mesh for the hernia....it's awful speaking from experience.
Thank you for being you. You always keep it real and I’m forever a fan. I felt like you were speaking to me.
Hay model Mike!!☺
Hey Pat, don't be so hard on yourself. Social Media is your job, separate that from you personal life. We all put on a persona at work, so can and should you. Please hold on to your family, we will always be here for you ❤ 💖
Yr amazing.. and a babe! Dont be 2 hard on yrself ok - okaay!
I agree with I am will be me no matter what 💯❤️ 😘
Love you Patricia😙😙😙
You are so beautiful!
Feel this so much. Had PND after my first child and had my second baby in May after an anxiety ridden pregnancy anyway as was not planned. Don’t think anybody is recognising or understanding how tough it is having a baby in the midst of this pandemic and the effect it’s having on people’s mental health. Thank you for bringing this to the forefront because it is massively being overlooked and people aren’t supporting the new parents during this time. Sending you lots of love xx
Sometimes social media makes it seem like everyone is happy. I am having challenges with my fiance. Our wedding had to be postponed and he might be made redundant. I am not enjoying my job but it is not the best time to start looking. I am more anxious than usual..
Keep your relationship with Mike off the internet.
Love this!
This is some real a$$ shit and I’m here for it 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾. We’re the same age and I literally feel like we’ve been ‘virtual girlfriends’ all these years so this felt like meeting up for drinks and just POURING IT ALL OUT. Proud of you for leaning in and can’t wait for this new chapter virtual sis 😘💕
goodluck ooo
For your relationship just get closer to God in prayer, he will heal you and bring you through
❤️❤️❤️
😢❤ you are incredible!
Love you Patricia, sending positive vibes your way 💗✨🌸💗
I wish I knew where Patricia’s top is from? 🛍
My advice to is if your husband is  a good man them don't allow the hipe to destroy your family... if you can disagree with your sister and is always able to fix it because she is blood, then  that is how you should view your spouse....the bible said you all are now one.
Thank you for sharing this, sending you love ❤️
Welcome back friend, all is well you got this , turn to God and He'll guide your steps , keep Him in the center of your marriage dear God is faithful 😊...... i love this side more ,but you're cussing a bit still love you , you were missed beautiful ❤
I absolutely love this Patricia !!! Go for what makes you happy and screw what anyone has to say. Love you 🤗🤗😘😘
Thank you so much for sharing and being vulnerable. Sending you some light.
You’re amazing Patricia. You’re imperfect and that’s amazing.
Patriciaaa you are a gorgeous woman. And you inspire lot of women like myself. I know it doesn’t help when someone says it. But let me tell you you always look great. I wish i had your beuty 💕
Blessing to you and yours.
Thank you for being so upfront and real. I did not know some of the issues one could deal with post delivery 😥
Jesus is the answer! Don't let the devil take your marriage or your life
Love you
Praying for you and mike ❤️❤️❤️ sending you both love
I appreciate, respect and love your honesty x
Oh Mrs. Pat. Hugs hugs and more hugs for you!!! and You and mr. Mike got this. Hugs! Please keep your relationship out of the lime lite like you've been. We love everything you do. don't succumb to pressure of sharing everything with us.
Could see so much pain in your eyes here - really hoping things work out in the best way for you xxx
Respect girl, I love you, xx
Hey Patricia!  I've been watching your videos for quite some time now and I've never commented before. Just wanted to say that I think you should take time off from social media and focus on rebuilding your marriage. Do what you feel has to be done to salvage that because you two need each other to raise your two beautiful girls. You can make it through this! Seek guidance from God as well; Pray for each other and with each other. Love you <3
Thank you so so so much for your honesty!!! I can relate sooo much that in some ways you sharing gave me comfort girl! Thank you!!! I think more people need to be open bc it provides an opportunity for women to support one another. It’s like how people don’t like to talk about money or finances. We do a disservice by not sharing.
sending you so so much love. trust meeeee, lockdown messed a lot of people's relationships including mine. peace and love to you and anyone else reading this xx
Thank you, really needed a video like this, just thank you 😘
Hi Patricia I normally don’t comment on other people’s lives , but just wanted to say stay both strong, address the issues and act from the heart with Gods grace . We all go through downs , but the ups are better once you overcome the downs . There is a new chapter ahead for you and and Micheal peace on to you and your family 🥰❤️🙏
it's always good to show us who you really are from time to time ; it makes us more attached to you . ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You look great now, and you don’t see it.
Yass! I am here with you on the changes 🙌🏼 I want to lean into my fears & finish 2020 stronger too! Can't wait to see the new content you have planned. I like raw/real chats/vlogs because they're so relatable and inspiring. You're amazing 💖
Thank you for opening up and sharing your experiences! Though it is not an expectation of you to do so, I can totally understand the healing properties of sharing whats really going on. Social media has become a place to showcase only the "perfect" things in life and its so important to level-set expectations on what people are really going through. Especially the post-partum experience -its not highly socialized and its so important for young women like myself to understand what moms go through and what to expect when its our time. Thank you for your candid video and sending good vibes to you and your family during these trying times xx
we love you xx
Definitely about to watch this video.... I need some motivation!!!!!❤
To all my married couples, ITS HARD sometimes. When your children are young its rough on a marriage. Hold on to your loved ones. %80 of divorced couples regret it.. STAY STRONG love, lots of therapy and prayer can really heal your relationship.
Thank you so much for your transparency ❤️.
Echo the supportive comments and as a Christian, encourage you to lean into God's Word, His truth about you and your marriage - because you and your family are worth it. You are so precious to God and to so many and you are worth stepping back for the self care. Therapy/Counseling is also great too!
Listen HERE.. YOU ARE NEVER GETTING DIVORCED!!!!     If there is love still there and there's NO form of abuse.. Then we rebuke the spirit of divorce in your life..
Sending so much love to you and you family. I’ve followed you for years and you’re such an open honest inspirational woman. Keep doing you 💓💓💓
Thanks for being so honest and real Patricia. You didn’t have to make this video, you could have kept up a pretence but you didn’t. And for that I rate you and I think you’re really brave 👏🏾
YOU ARE AMAZING PATRICIA AND WE YOUR LOYAL FANS LOVE YOU UNCONDITIONALLY WHATEVER ISSUE YOU’RE FACING BABY GIRL STAY STRONG 😍❤️👍🏻
I have always enjoyed your content! I want to thank you for showing this vulnerability and authenticity to us. This whole pandemic has been an eye changer and I'm glad it's making you a conqueror.
Thank you for sharing a very mature blog. You're becoming a beautiful woman inside and out. We women have to shut down the negative thoughts and brings them into captivity and change the thoughts into what is good and holy  I remember you mentioning your concordance and needing to read and study more. You've got a good husband so continue being a helper and shining light for your family. God bless you Patricia and your beautiful family in Jesus Holy name amen
Thank you for sharing this with us and I hope you get well soon physically and emotionally❤️
we love you SOOOOOO much <3
You are amazing.  Continue to stay true to yourself.  Some may like it some may not but who gives a sh@t. We are all human. As women we go through the most. We are here with you for the long hall. ❤
Motherhood is challenging, body changes are real. Embracing the changes are hard. Marriage is hard work + COVID + childcare + work = possible marinade for disaster. But after every storm comes a rainbow 🌟
Hey Patricia, I don‘t usually comment at all. But the things you said and the way you share and you‘re about to share, what‘s really going on, makes me feel like I‘m more connected to you. Everyone is trying to only show the positive and like they have their shit together. And this is where the pressure comes from. No one is perfect and no one does not struggle. We need to share the truth, even if she‘s not cute. Cause we are all humans. Sorry for my english 😬 hugs and kisses from Germany 😘
Thank you for your words
i'm sure you are being too hard on yourself!! you look beautiful, and more importantly you seem like a real nice person! wishing you strength and love to deal with everything going on in your life!
thank you for this video!!
Hi Patricia, understandably the quarantine period could be a challenge, being together all the time, running out of ideas, but you’re an emotionally taxing and draining point in your life, Covid, post  pregnancy, body images issues, being a momma to making baby well... just communicate, communicate & communicate some more, and not to us (your YouTube peeps) but to your husband. If talking leads to arguments, try writing letters to each other. Date one another again, see things from the other person’s perspective. Pray. Take a break from life, smell the roses, watch how flowers grow, how the ants work, how animals care for one another. Michael is a great husband, you are a wonderful wife, marital success isn’t achieved over night. Xoxo
The raw content we all need. All the love, Patricia. <3
Sending you love and healing on this new season of life 🦋✨🧿 and, we need details on the top
Wow I was shocked that her surname isn't Bright lol! Not a bad thing, was just surprising 🤗
Patricia you are a bright ray of light... so be ‘BRIGHT’ if you want too!
YEAH, DO  IT GIRL!!!
Thank you for sharing Pat, I know how much courage it takes to open up. I've been going through some similar stuff since pregnancy and my baby is 19 months now! Praying you and your family get through this storm ijn 🙏🏽💕
Me nodding vehemently at my screen! I felt this Patricia. *big hug*
Really appreciate this video, it takes a lot to be honest not only with yourself but with us, we are ready to come on whatever journey you’re taking us on❤️
Hunnnnnn bless uuuuu. Your amazing we love u .uou don’t owe us shit but if u want to chat then do uuuu. Marriage & babies is a blessing but it’s workkk keep pushing through, u can do this. Stay strong please❤️👑
This is the rawest video I've EVER seen on youtube. Amazing
2020 is a very spiritual year. Thiseapiritualists saying we've done to another dimension/ vibration. It's so real. Our kids are changing so drastically it's insane.
”we’re currently working real hard for this to continue” -  👁👄👁 GOOOOODDDD FOORBBIIIIIDDDDDDD, it will last long in the name of  יהוה, Yeshua Hamashiach and the Holy Spirt!!
I love you so so much . I love watching your videos . All of them !
Wow I totally agree Patricia🥺 I’ve been praying & just seeking God & honestly just finding myself💛 hope the best for you!  PS: I loveeee how everyone is entering a new & better chapter in life even in the midst of the craziness in the world. God is still & always good!!💛💛
Love you love you love you. God bless, keep guide and strengthen you💗💗💗
❤️❤️❤️
Well done for sharing this. Takes guts.  “If you’re going through hell, keep going!” - Winston Churchill xxx
No, we don't want you to get that personal with your relationship and family. We respect the boundaries and the internet is just evil, keep your people safe. We are all going through it, don't feel alone.
Thank you for updating us all on this journey of your life. Personally, I think you’re very strong, even though you said that was a disguise to not address your fears. You have changed and inspired many people, myself included, so keep doing you. Can’t wait to see that snatched waist🤣🙌🏿

Love you so much you're such an Inspiration x
DONT SHARE UR MARRIAGE
Patricia and Ladies, pleas remember, you don't have to look perfect. As soon as you accept your being and imperfections you free yourself so much. Of course allow yourself to improve what really affects your body or mind. But as long you shine in character and know that, you realize your body looks are just not the most important thing in the world. You are supposed to be healthy and be the best of what you can be, but you don't have to chase the goals of society.
Please take care of your beautiful family
Get better, the Lord is your strength
Aww Patricia 😭 don't be so hard on yourself lady ❤️ Some other commenters here have gone full on with the advice but I'll just say, try to be a bit kinder in the way you talk to yourself. Everyone is dealing with this trash fire that is 2020 and it's HARRD 😭 I can't even imagine what it must have been like for you to have a newborn in this environment and to have medical complications from it (fun fact, I weighed 9 pounds, gave my mother a hernia and she never let me live it down 😂) Kia kaha Patricia - stay strong ❤️💪
You're just a strong lady and i wish you nothing else but enough strength to pull through❤
Prayers for strength for you and Mike!  You do not have to be transparent about your life.  Us outside folk(yes we are outsiders) don’t need to know everything.  You and Mike made vows before God, not us.  I hope and pray you are seeking professional help from a counselor.  Not a pastor, but a real counselor who deals with married couples!  Hang in there!  You and Mike got this!!  Be blessed!
Thank you for sharing such personal details in regards to your life update I will be praying for your marriage & that during this time that the pandemic will bring you & your husband closer I absolutely LOVE your channel & your personality keep your head up! 🙏🏾🥰
Thank you
We'll be here sis. Keeping the faith for you and Mike. You guys got this! And you're gonna be okay. 💜
Thank you Patricia 🧘🏾‍♂️🧡
Don't be too hard on yourself Patricia. We're all clinging onto a spinning rock trying to figure out this thing called life. Hugs💜
Surrender your life to Jesus, then you’ll find true life 💛
You are strong for doing this xxx
We love you Patricia.
LOVE YOU PATTY O 💕💕 As an Aquarius, I felt everything you just said! 😂
Pat, the best person you could ever be is yourself...its authentically beautiful. I have loved watching your growth over the years(been here before you and Mike were married) Anyways, take care and be well...XoXo
Most YouTube success stories find themselves divulging into their personal lives to satisfy there need for interesting content. Choose wisely my dear. Choose wisely......
I've been around since you were the britpopprincess and won't be going anywhere. Share or don't share whatever you want. Do what is best for you and your family. Also really really hoping that you and Mike work things out. It is normal to have rough patches but we are believing for you guys to come out prosperous on the other side!
You are so real!!! I love your channel!!! Give me some tips on mine LOKEY143
Don't share everything  because you'll get backlash,
love your honesty
I had to put down my dinner to write this comment.... YAAAAAAAS i am so ready to see the new content and transparency! It's what the world needs especially at the moment! xxxxx
💚
You are entitled to share whatever you feel comfortable sharing. It's refreshing to see a creator not put everything out there. You have to allow yourself some level of privacy. Sending you, Mike, and your beautiful girls love 💕
I had to sit down properly at 9:20 👀
I connected to her at 06:00 mins 😍
My prayers are with u. I so needed to hear this, to know it's not just me being over emotional and self analytical ❤ I've been feeling like I've wasted nearly a whole year, but keep trying to look for the positives.xx
I agree with you about how tough it is to be a woman especially motherhood. I would love to have children in future so it's really lovely to hear your story. Good luck with everything 😊❤
I hope you and Mike work things out and whichever way things go you're both very happy at the end ❤
Well 2020 has been a rough year for all of us. I surely believe that being with your partner 24/7 can kill the vibe after a while. I hope Mike and you can work through the stuff that has been bothering you and I really do hope that the rest of 2020 will be a bit nicer to all of us. All the demonstrations and the news haven’t been positive and also the little change of scenery in our lives take a toll. Let’s just stay strong together and support eachother and see the positive ❤️ lots of love. We can all get through this, we are strong 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Here for the next chapter Patricia!!! Do you girl we love you!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Authenticity at its best, this spoke to me Patricia Real 😉😘
We love and will forever support you. ❤ we all going through the most. Xx
Make Jesus the center of it allllllll. Not your youtube, not your Ted talks, not your glam up and botox . JESUS! MAKE JESUS THE CENTER OF IT ALL. JESUS MATTERS.... We live in a self centered society, all about "my truth", do you and as long as your happy attitudes. THATS WRONG! You want the right mind set? SET YOUR MIND ON THEEE TRUTH. JESUS!!.( I'm preaching to myself too).. Dont give up on your marriage, satan is a liar and a thief!  Fight for your marriage. And when you put Jesus first He will help you with everything you NEED. GOD bless you Patricia.  Philippians 4:19
I was today years old when I found out Patricia’s surname isn’t Bright! Thanks for your honesty. I think you’ve voiced the way a lot of people are feeling. Hang in there and we’re rooting for you and Mike. I know you guys have got this and can fight to work through anything.
I am so grateful to use for showing you have depth beyond the materialism. You've probably saved some marriages including your own by speaking the real. Just Beautiful
Ya’ll hang in there ok. If nobodies cheating, beating or doing things that puts the family in danger you have no grounds for seperating or divorcing. Keep God first, remember why you fell in love with each other and forgive often. Apporach each other with a servant heart and you’ll be just fine because the question will always be “How can I serve you". I’m glad the baby is doing better praise God for that and I’m glad you are working on you. Be blessed and don’t talk a lot about your relationship people will only want more. I mean don’t be elusive but set some clear boundries for sure.  God bless and know you and Mike can do this!
And this is why I love you Patricia 😭🥺
God bless you all!!!! We are here to help each other.  🤗❤
You're a good person and so is Mike. Allow yourself grace and allow the same for Mike.  Your marriage is worth the work.
Still here babe ‼️‼️‼️😘😘😘😘
You are adored 💜
Praying for you all🙏🏾
Being strong isn’t always about having everything together. You ARE strong because you recognize you are human and have weaknesses, but you keep pushing forward anyways. Hang in there! Trust in yourself and love who you are! There are always going to be some bad days. But you are beautiful inside and out!
Patricia, if you want your life to be better, stop sharing any of your personal life on the internet. We are strangers, you are also a stranger to everyone on this platform. (Except those you know personally). Those who say they love you, don’t even know you. You don’t know who is out there.
❤️❤️ You and Mike are forever. This pandemic is causing so much bad things but better times are coming
❣️❣️
This just makes you so much more relatable Patricia... sorry you’ve been having a shit time, but you’ve got an army of us behind you, rooting for you ❤️
I love and appreciate YOU. Thank you for being open and honest about the struggles that we all go through but are afraid to talk about
Hernia! Ahhhhhh that sounds scary! thanks for letting us know
Love you Patricia!! Praying for you and us all. God got us and its okay not to be okay sometimes
I love you even more now... you are so REAL, that is what makes you special. Did anyone notice how she casually dropped that Bright isn't her real name LOOOL.
2020 is the year of real trial and turbulences. I really look up to yours and Mike’s relationship. So I’m praying for you and your home❤️ I’m also working on changing a lot. I’ve failed a lot and I’m still failing but I’m not quitting 🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️
One day at a time beautiful...
❤️❤️❤️
Love you sis! Hope you feel better❤️
I don’t know if this fate or what. But after watching this video, YouTube suggested your wedding video from 8 years ago Patricia and it has 2.9M views and you’re currently on 2.9M subscribers.❤️
My advice would be to look into a good couples therapist. And I mean a very good one with years of experience and wonderful reviews. It doesn't even have to be a religious based therapist. Just one that works for you and your situation. I believe you both will make it through. Long marriage have never come easy, any happily married couple will tell you that. But I think stepping away from it all and focusing on each other is the best way to go about things
Don’t be afraid of ‘if my life breaks down people will think ooo I thought she had it together’. Corona don’t care what we think 2020 should be, you don’t have to care what people think you should be
hi i think u are mixing things up with this video and how u feel .but i would like u to deal with them separately dont mix themup  together. motherhood is beautiful, any changes u hv in ur body is a blessing an the evient of u carrying ur baby i ont think u shoul be worrying about that. i unerstand though  if u like to get it fix u r free to do dt is ur body.. ont mix them up it is nature it happens.. it is got nothimg to do with ur baby, ur marriage etc .live happy an enjoy ur motherhood, take care of ur family and marriage dont listen to what people are saying or think about u, and ont let all that bring u down count it all as part oflife i hope this help.
Lots of love for you 💙💖 How did I not know your name wasn’t Bright 🤣
You don’t own anyone anything when it comes to your personal life, things like love. I also think we all have something we don’t like about our bodies. Do what makes you happy girl. ❤️❤️
In the mighty name of Jesus! You and Mike will have a life long marriage, In Jesus name!!!!
❤️ God bless you and your family
thank you for being so open, , sending love and hugs
I love you ❤
I think couples everywhere in the WORLD had a difficult time in their relationship, specially married people and who lived together! I’d love to hear their experience 😅
you got this girl xx
"Love the body that you have when you have it because it's gonna keep changing".. I needed to hear this 🙌🏽💕
Wow Pat , I appreciate your honesty and openness , it's funny how we age we can see through smiles and laughter bcoz behind all that there would be a crying heart , I could see that in you ,  I say I appreciate becoz this gives power to us women to openly cry and ask for just a listening ear without shame ,, I know you will be well and we pray for all us women to break and stand up again,bcoz the power and opportunities are the midst of our weak points, God bless you and your family
You are a true inspiration. I'm literally in awe of you. Can't wait for your new journey xxx
Patricia, you do not owe anyone anything. Please take care of yourself, focus on what you need to do for your family and screw everyone else. Push come to shove, the people that will always be there for you are your family. DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR ISSUES OF YOUR HUSBAND ON YOUR CHANNEL! Save that for therapy between the two of you. We love you regardless.
Thanks for sharing Patricia. I've found your videos very uplifting during this period so sorry to hear you've been struggling 😥 So important to be your authentic self. Hard, but important!🙏🏽✨✨
I really appreciate everything you do Patricia, I hope  everything works out for you and may you feel lighter and brighter !
Everyday I learn that you should marry somebody that will fight just as hard to keep you, and keep you happy.
Sharing your full truth...I absolutely love it. I am YOU. This video was so relatable and much needed for me to see at this very moment 👑👑👑
Your so beautiful @ patricia bright, don’t be toooo hard on yourself.   Please where is your top from also ❤️❤️❤️❤️
We love you Patricia, and we are here for you.  God Bless you, all women go through what you are right now.  And you're  absolutlely correct, we are always evolving, yet everyone else wants us to stay the same.
Patricia, continue to pray.  2020 hasn't been kind to anyone, but please give yourself grace.  Not only have you had a baby, but your baby was sick.  That's hard on anyone especially, marriage.  Focus on yourself, faith, and family.  Take a little break.  Marriage is HARD!  It's already a working progress. That's all marriages.  I've been married over 11years interracial marriage and have had a sick kid with stressful jobs! I'm sending you and your family prayers.   Seek Jesus in this!  We all should.
I've been married for 22 years, and anyone who has been in a relationship for more than 5 years has experienced something. Life/relationship is hard enough without the internet in your relationship. I can't imagine doing all that you do, all while being a great mom and wife.  I have been here since the "cow print" phase, and I'm good with you keeping your personal life private.  Also, I honestly think your body is amazing even with the issues you named; girl you are HOT.
Whew girl! The struggles of being a woman, we should've gotten a disclaimer lol.Thank-you for sharing because this life is no joke and I appreciate you sharing your truth, the good and bad. It's comforting to know that we all face challenges, and I strongly believe things work out for the best in the end despite the trivial journey to get there.You've got this Patricia!
I love it when you show your true authentic self.
I respect you even more now that i know you are human 😌
You're a beast my Aquarian sister.I appreciate your transparency.Alot of people can't take that about us but I can and I can understand why you do it.Bless you and the family.
This year has been soooo crazy. Esp if you’re a creative. The vibes have been a roller coaster.
The most important thing you really need to do is seek first the kingdom of God. Maybe mike doesn’t want to be in the world the way you want to. You can’t be lukewarm. You can’t have one foot in the world and one is Christ. You have to choose. Christ or the devil. Heaven or hell (the world and things of the world)
You seriously Rock. I can only imagine how hard it was to be so open. Well done you. ❤️
❤️❤️❤️
thanks @patricia. just thanks
You don't owe us anything, not a single thing! You don't owe us transparency, we will be here EITHER WAY. Just know, a lot of people following you won't be able to handle your transparency, they will start to project things onto you and your relationship based on your transparency and they will draw horrible conclusions. Then they will spread those negative conclusions and force them onto you. Please protect yourself! If keeping things totally private protects your family the most, please do that! We will be here REGARDLESS, we ride with you either way Pat. We love you for YOU, not for the insight into your personal life. I will remember you and Mike and your babies in my prayers. We love you so much xx
I paused the video to go make tea...
I LOVE YOU, you can always be honest with us, life changes all the time for everyone, hope you find the stability that you are looking for. :-)
I wish I could just give you a hug Patricia! May God bless you for sharing your story and your current feelings. I pray that you have peace and joy.
Oh i didn't know Bright wasn't her last name. It makes sense now that I remember she's Nigerian lol. I wonder what it actually is
The mind and the body be doing too much. Can we get a tattoo? A t-shirt with this sentence? :)
All will be well
I think keep your family off of your channel. It was becoming apparent that Mike was unhappy making certain appearances or tried to assert his dominance when he did. This (youtube/social media) isnt worth risking what you had prior which was a good thing. Focus on yourself and your fam and literally just give us less personal content
I think you need to give yourself a break! We are all growing and learning. This is a transition year and its not easy growing up. We are all growing up each day and each year. Besides the business. You are a woman, wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend and on top of that, business owner of multiple streams. Be kind to yourself! Life is not easy and always do whats best for you and your family.   Enjoy the moments with your babies as the years fly past and thats what most important. You and Mike together are the most important as without the two of you, nothing else matters. He is the one who holds you at night, listens to your fears and supports your dreams. No-one can do anything alone.   Be kind your yourself, enjoy the evolution of Patricia 2.0/3.0/4.0 and be proud of all you have achieved! We got you x
Love your authenticity
It so crazy I decided to watch your update and now I don’t feel so alone. I’ve literally been having the worst day and you being open and transparent has soothed me.
Had me crying 5 minutes in😭😭 You got this chick...
Love the rawness of this !!! We support you girl ...all love !
I pray that you find the Inner peace that only God freely gives.
Thank you for sharing. It’s nice to know that we’re not alone. This year has been extra trying and it’s hard not to beat ourselves up for not being our usual selves.
Love you always regardless of what content you produce and regardless of what happens in your life <3
Thank you Patricia for making this video I really felt this and it touched my heart I’m happy for you!❤️
Cheers to taking control of the last few months of what has been quite the rollercoaster of a year! Thank you always for sharing your life with us!!!
I've been here for years but I didn't know that wasn't really your real last name 🤯😂
Loving the transparency! x
Patricia I would advise you to also recognise something important YouTube is not as important as you nurturing your personal welfare,taking care of your mental health, taking care of your home ,focusing on your children and working on your marriage,if the pressures are too heavy and are constantly affecting you ,you are completely allowed to at any point in your life seek to protect your mental health and personal welfare to take a break from social media and focus on your personal life and well being in your private life,YouTube will always be here, do not feel the pressure to always be there with us,prioritise you and don’t ever feel bad for needing a moment or a break to work on yourself and take care of your family because we can all see and respect how much they are important to you and how much you love them and you can take all the time you need to take care of your personal relationship and take care of yourself.
This is honestly so encouraging and spirit led! I am embarking on my "influencer" journey and I want it to be one based upon figuring out who we with God as the foundation. I've been following you for a while but this is different. You're amazing and I pray nothing but blessings over you and your family!
May God continue to bless you and your family.
Patricia I’ve been watching you since I was 16 , I’m now in my twenties . You are inspirational and beautiful. Glad to know you even more !
We love you Patricia and you ARE strong! 💜
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Patricia, I watched this video late last night and kept the tab open because I knew I had a lot to say. I found your account a few years ago because of a SHEIN try on haul and loved your personality immediately! I could tell you were a genuine person and someone that is worth my time. You are such an amazing and inspirational woman and mother!  I have to be honest, there was a point in time where I noticed you weren't being your authentic self. Obviously I don't know you in person, but I could tell that you were holding a lot of your truth back. It turned me off for a little bit but I always stayed on your pages because I knew you would snap back soon. I am SO proud of you! Please stay true to yourself, that's why we're all here. We love the real you, with the real opinions <3
I will pray for you and your husband. I hope you can come out with a stronger relationship after this. I look forward to seeing more of "you".   : )
Thank you for sharing:) God got y'all - keep praying and most importantly HAVE FAITH!!
Loved this!!!
yessss queen! love this and you!
If sharing more helps you mentally then do it but if not you don’t owe us that
I almost started to cry cause that post natal depression is REAL oooooo. Live your truth , be happy and tell the haters to kick rocks.
I love u and my payers are with u I know that baby Grace will grow up to be a remarkable young lady keep your head up and stay strong 💞
Love you Particia!! You are strong girl!
A beautiful video so inspirational to see you make sucha personal and intimate video about your private. You do come across as the woman who’s got everything , her life together and all figured out but this video shows a more human side to you that you do still go through struggles just like us all. Really love the idea and we’d love to see more keep shinning Patrica star 🌟♥️
It means a lot that you came up here and share your truth...It makes me relate to you so much much more, it also reminds me and I hope everyone else, that your human too and we all go through things both good and bad. Anyways ways I say this to say keep growing so us your followers can keep growing with you 😊
When I saw "Life Update", I clicked on the video and checked Patricia's wedding ring. Please don't scare us like that 😅 May God restore your marriage 🙏🏽
It means the world to us loyal fans that you could come and be honest and real we love you and we got your back sis ❤️
I wish well known Black youtubers didn’t feel obligated to share their personal lives with their subscribers. But you’re very brave for your transparency💜
https://youtu.be/jLx5dMIw1zU LADIES!!!🔥
So proud of you for making this. Please only show areas of your life you feel comfortable showing, you don't owe us anything! Being honest doesn't mean letting down all of the barriers to your personal life, just wanted to make sure you knew that 😊 love you girl ❤
I believe Henrietta below said it all , much love sweetie, we do have our own stories, but not a vlogger , but we respect who you are & you are all ready appreciated by a lot of us 💖🇬🇧 xxxxxxx p.s wow that punched home , I also did not realise when I looked good & be happy with the stage you are at at the. Time thank you xx
I’ve had the most confusing year. I’m constantly finding myself facing repetitive battles. It’s hard to trust when this year has been soo 🥺 keep me in your prayers please cos I know when two or more are gathered, there He’ll be 🙏🏽 thanks for being real Patricia 💗
Patricia, thank you for sharing your truth sis. We’ve been rocking with you for years and will continue to for more. What you’re doing is brave and we all go through it in different ways. It’s honestly refreshing to see such vulnerability because the social media world is filled with so much ‘perfection’ which adversely impacts mental health, body image and so forth. At this point in the year we are all just trying to stay alive, sane and make it through. Keep shining 💫
Only thing personally making this year worth it is growing my little son inside me💙🥰
Do you mentor ?
Hey Patricia!  During quarantine I started to feel like a useless piece of meat.  Now that things have loosened a bit, I pushed myself to start running and power walking in the nearby park.  I go every other day and I feel so so much better. It's a small step to recovery but at least I am doing something about it.  There are 1000s of us who dont have everything figured out, even millions.  It's impossible to catch up with the speed at which we are all going.  Dont be hard on yourself.  It's a slow process as long as we recognize the issue and move towards fixing it without rushing anywhere.  We need to slow down. It's good for us.  The one thing COVID has taught me, is  we MUST realize what is really IMPORTANT in this life and get rid of all distractions and useless actions.  LOVE <3
All the best hun
Your situation is about to be one of your biggest testimonies! Stay positive stay bright because God is about to use your situation for something great
You look good 🙏
Thank you so much for sharing your vulnerable side with us. This is reality. This is life. ❤I've been watching you since 2009 & I'm glad to see you've got your zest back! Love from London
Jesus is the only one that can give true satisfaction. Please seek him
There's real strength in someone being vulnerable and being able to self reflect. We need more people like you!!! You should be proud of yourself
❤❤❤❤❤
I admire you for sharing. I’ve been watching you for a few years. I LOVE YOU more for being open and honest and sharing parts of yourself that you haven’t before. Do you boo! If you feel the need to be transparent will help you heal through certain things do it 🤍 you are what matters most ❤️ I love you more blessings
Patricia Gos is the only one that satisfies. He is our only hope for us humans. Until you seek him continually there is going to be dissatisfaction about ourselves. Having daughters try to fix this before they come to know. We love y’all stay blessed.
I relate to a lot of what you say in this Vid. For me though it's been my life for the last 11 years. I was diagnosed with a chronic illness. It was life changing, lock down wasnt anything new to me because  I spend a huge amount of time at home, ill and depressed. I so get you when you talk about putting on the show the face and pretending everything is cool. I've had people question my illness because I'm an actress for couple of hours,, they dont see the days spent in bed the hospital visits and the tears nor the troubles it causes with the most important person in my life (husband) thanks Patricia for being so honest. Your little girl is so important and I can relate as my illness causes rashes and skin inflammation that is painful/itchy and as an adult embarrassing. Keep being you and thanks again for getting to the point and saying it loud and clear sometimes life throws you a set of bad cards you just have to play them. I hope your baby girl is better. My fave phrase is this too shall pass. Xxx. Just one last comment. Dont let the trolls stop you from being who you are. I'm old enough to be your Mum I think your a pretty amazing you woman. Xx
Thank you for being so honest ❤️ I’m here for it!!!
Dont do it Patricia. Dont get a divorce. Ask God to give you the wisdom to keep your union going.. pls don't let anything jeopardize your matrimonial journey ❣️
I admire your transparency and it’s only up from here 💓
Love your content love your honesty 🙏🏻 you look amazing 😉 stay strong 💓
But who said you DONT LOOK GOOD?! Patricia stop speaking negatively about yourself, what you say even as a joke goes into your sub conscious. You really need to work on your spirituality and get in tune with yourself, your body and your mind. Meditate, eat alkaline diet and fuel your soul with food that has power!  Peace and love sis
Thanks for sharing this nice to know we’re all not alone
Omg being a YouTube sounds soul crunching. Sister I don’t think you have to share your inner family situation etc. Focus on you and focus on certain content that don’t compromise your mental health and your family
Wow all these wonderful comments! Some brilliantly express my actual thoughts on the vid! Patricia, you are a blessing! Keep doing you - no pressure, you’re amazing!
Girl, you don't need to try and keep up. You are AMAZING! your little girl is incredibly lucky to have a strong female leader for a mum. You are a star, btw, you don't just inspire the girls out there, us guys really look up to you too. Just saying 😛
You look good!!
Surprised you haven’t considered therapy. You should really try it, it might change the way you deal with things. wishing you well 🙏🏾
Being together during quarantine is really challenging. You have to focus on the times and feeling for eachother before covid. Because there will be a time when it will be a similar time again. This is not forever and take care of eachother ❤️
You look divine 🤩❤️✨
I have been  watching  your  channel, but  I did  not subscribe  until  now, because with this video   you  hit a ''reality '' about  how  a lot  of  us feel about  our bodies .Possibly  not appreciating    how  good  we  have looked  previously  and did  not  even  know we looked that good,  until life  happened to us. That  being  said  we still  look good  now!  How indeed the  impact of  covid-19   has  been  exhausting  mentally and   lastly  how  we try  to be  ''happy'' or  seek out positive  affirmations, while withering inward   about    so  many  other things  impacting  us! Thank  you.
You owe us nothing however I’m sure it feels good to get some things off of your chest. I’m an actual professional Therapist and 2020 has been a rough year for so many people including mental health professionals that have to hold it together while helping our clients. The passing of Chadwick Boseman was almost the last straw for me. We have to take care of ourselves above all else. Self care is so very important! Take care of you. I actually thought “Bright” was your married name...🤦🏾‍♀️🤣🤣
Omw I actually thought your surname was bright 😂😜😊😁😅
I just wish I could hug you! I'm the same in terms of putting up a wall and being strong all the time. My best friend also had a baby and she's had a hard time with post natal depression. All my love ❤️❤️
Although I may not know you personally, from watching all your content and observing your behaviour, I see you as a very strong independent woman who works hard to achieve her goals, but you're someone that has to understand and accept that you brought life into this world TWICE therefore nothing will or should be the same after that nor your body or your mind, its ok to struggle but with your energy and the energy of your friends and family around (LOVE MAUREEN) you'll get through this difficult time and many other ones that are yet to come. You are already one step closer to being happier as you have acknowledged what is causing you pain or discomfort both physical and mental and you're working on it which proves how strong you are! Keep up the good work gal and do not feel forced to share your personal life with everyone out there because it is called personal for a reason share what you are comfortable with!!!! LOTS OF LOVE, hope everything goes your way and good luck with your next chapter XOXOXOXO <3
Thank you for sharing ❣️ 🥺 I’m sure this took a lot out of you and it’s a great step to changing your life and whatever else you need to work on...keep pushing and having faith and everything will come together for the good 💞 💕 XOXO 💋
I love this type of Authenticity!
Praying for you guy's ❤
Very Respectfully With All Due Respect Good Gods Day, Sis Patricia girl I am absolutely Proud of you and your Loving movement as a Beautiful Wife to your lovely husband, Beautiful Mom to your lovely daughters, Beautiful Sister To your Lovely Sister, Beautiful  Daughter To Your Lovely Mom and a Beautiful Smart Strong Business Saavy Woman to the Cooperate World, Sis Patricia I have been watching your channel for years now and *you just don't know you have* *been that best breath of fresh* *air absolutely always*, I have always admired your bubbly spirit, your openness and your realness and let us please not forget how extremely educationally informative you have absolutely always been on your channel for all of us about so many taboo like subjects, thank you for those beautiful nuggets for life moments you always richly bring light to for many of us, I am Absolutely Praying To The Good Lord That You and Brother Michael are not headed towards nothing but Positive Restorations of Any and All Types of Nothing But Much Wonderfuls and Many Joys Within Your Marriage as hard times will and do come in all marriages and while on that note as you stated how you and Brother Michael have been doing you alls extreme best to hold on close and tight in your marraige during these challenging times in your relationship, I absolutely Pray that it is okay If I May out of Nothing but Pure Godly Love I would like to give you these Scriptures just to place Gods Commands on sustaining the marriage during rough times, I Pray that this does not come off as Nothing negative just Prayerfully this information can be received and taken in as an enlightment to the marriage as you both continue to work things out positively, ●●●●●●●●●●●●●●● *Since God Is The Authority* *Over All Scripturual Marriages* *Let's us see what The* *Authority Himself God says* *about Marriage* ●●●●●●●●●●●●●●● *MATTHEW **5:31**-32 NKJV* “Furthermore it has been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.  *LUKE **16:18** NKJV* 18 “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.  *1 CORINTHIANS **7:10**-16 NKJV* 10  Now to the married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to depart from her husband.   11  But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to divorce his wife.   12  But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her.   13  And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him.   14  For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.   15  But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases.

Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?  *1 CORINTHIANS **7:39** NKJV* 39  A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.   *MALACHI **2:16** NKJV* 16 "For the Lord God of Israel says That He hates divorce, For it covers one's garment with violence," Says the Lord of hosts. "Therefore take heed to your spirit, That you do not deal treacherously.  *MATTHEW 19:1-9 NKJV* Jesus' Teaching on Divorce 19 1  Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, that He departed from Galilee and came to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.   2  And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them there.  3  The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?"   4 And He answered and said to them, "Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning 'made them male and female,'   5 and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?   6 So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate."   7  They said to Him, "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?" 8  He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.   9 And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery."  ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ Sis Patricia you and Brother Michael PLEASE HANG IN THERE!!!!! Now If there happens to be a need for a separation, not divorce, but just some time apart, God completely understands that but make sure that the separation is strictly for restoring the marriage, no matter how long the restoration takes you both just continue to work hard at restoring you alls marriage, Gods Awesome Love To You and Your Beautiful Family Sis Patricia I Am Extremely Proud of You and As A Long time viewer of your channel and Happy To See All of Your Up and Coming New Chapter Youtube Channel Content!!!!  MANY BLESSINGS SIS!!!!! V/R
We love you Patricia!!!🥰🥰
I’m glad with this change, life is hard, people arnt perfect. I love the transparency
I feel this so much Patrica. It’s like we be trynna act like life is great but deep down we be struggling lol. That’s why I took a social media break but I’m still posting on YouTube. Mental breaks are soo important. I need to do a life update myself 😂 I done moved to another state and didn’t tell my subscribers where. I’m a real private person even tho I’m a content creator. Even with my bf of 3 years, you’d come to my page and think I’m single lol 🤷🏾‍♀️ privacy is best sometimes, people on the internet evil 😩
Praying for you, Patricia! ❤️
When you’re in an emotional place, everything feels like it’s going down hill. This environment breeds stress. I’m learning to not make life decisions when I’m a mess. Thank you for expressing what we all feel from time to time.
<3
Thanks for sharing. Hopefully that helps you, but if it doesn't really help and you just feel like you need to share more with your viewers... You don't. Trust, I've been a viewer for a long time but some things are private and don't need to be shared. Sending love 💕
Hang in there.  I've had 4 kids.  Still living with that pregnant belly.  It gets better!
Transparency is Growth! Great Vid!❤️
I really enjoyed this video...so proud that you opened up to us...we love you 😘
Pls protect your privacy. We don’t need all that access into your life because there are wicked pple on earth watching. Always happy to see you happy 💗
Share what you feel comfy sharing Patricia even though you owe no one an explanation for what's to come. I just want to tell you that...while watching and listening to you speak your truth in this video (I paused @11:22), all I kept saying in my head was " YES, PATRICIA! YES, GIRL! I HEAR YOU & CAN APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW!".  Patricia, I wish you Life's Goodness, whatever that looks like, and whatever that means for you personally, Sis! You're so right! LIFE IS SHORT! To hell with Algorithms and chasing the latest hot attention grabbing stunt! YOU DON'T NEED TO DO ALL THAT! Do & share whatever it is YOU want to do & share! Just be YOU when you do it! I for one look forward to seeing what your next phase in life looks like! I want to thank you for sharing your journey & growth thus far here on YouTube, Patricia! I believe many people think what you guys do here is like an easy walk in the park to pull off but I, on the other hand, feel like when channels are done well, like yours and Jackie Aina's & the list goes on...when people like you guys put out content, I know WORK was put into it! Then, on top of what you guys do here, you guys are making BOSS MOVES in your other business endeavors! And on top of ALL THAT and most importantly, you're holding down families and living REAL LIVES in this CRAZY, BEAUTIFUL, DIFFICULT WORLD we're living in right now! I said all that to say, THAT'S A WHOLE LOT TO HAVE ON ONE'S PLATE and, if dialing down some of the 'Always On & Happy' facade will make you a happier person & a more content YOU, then I say GO FOR IT! Patricia, you have given me many hours of laughter, great fashion and makeup tips, alongside some really solid business advice and I thank you for it all but I'm here to tell you Sis, speaking only for myself of course, I'm finding what you're sharing here in this video to be quite exciting & I'm looking forward to seeing what the lovely, talented, 'Patricia (Bright?😉)' has in store next, Queen! 💪🏽👑💗 So YES!  DO YOU!  BE YOUR TRUE, AUTHENTIC SELF!  I AM SO HERE FOR IT!  Allow me to introduce myself! Hi Patricia! My name is Kimberly.  Nice to meet (the new) you!  Welcome, Sis!🤗💗
We love you Patricia and the content you give us is invaluable ...This year has been tough on the best of us,...if you need to, take time for you and your family, ..2020 has given us all a thorough beating♥️
Ahhh yesss! I can’t wait! Looking forward to your next chapter 👸🏾
Thank you for being so transparent 🦋
Patricia you really are like one of us, everyday women and I think the continual well put together images can make us forget that, but you really go through so much of what we do, through relationships, body image, life stress , ambitions etc. We love you and take your time, it is your life and we are grateful you even share parts of it. God bless you and your family!
Yo! Her name is not BRIGHT!  My whole life is a lie 😂 been watching since BritPopVlogs. 🚶🏾
Not to minimize the seriousness of your situation, but gurl' welcome to the REAL world. Its good to have the blinders off so early in your life, embrace it and continue to build your life the way you decide to, that is the most important part of your existence. Thank you for inviting us into your world, but the reality is that YOU COME FIRST, and your family.  This is just entertainment for us, motivation comes from the realism you've shared here on your channel./  Thanks for your realism here.  I wish you the best in all your endeavors.  And enjoy motherhood.
I just love you 🥰 been going through the saaaame so feel this x
quarantine is hard!
oncef again thank you so much for your honesty! I am currently in UK and my fiance is away and not  being together through the scariest part of the pandemic was really hard, the distance alone was already enough to bring some hard days of wondering and uncertainty, but i'm trying and he's trying and i am praying we have the strength to make it through until we are together again next year ...praying for you and your fam as well x
May God Bless You and your family.  Praying for each of you. Stay Strong 💗
Relationships are HARD. Worth it but HARD. Wow. Praying for you 🙏
I miss seeing mike. Praying for you guys and Sending you healing energy.
OMG! I love you Patricia! To be able to come in front of the camera and be authentic takes a lot of strength!  We need more content like that! Personally I really appreciate your honesty, I mean that's why I've been watching your videos for so long. Thank you to bring us with you on this journey. Take care of yourself and I'm sending lots of positive/good energy your way!
Patricia where's your top from?
thank you for sharing Patricia. You are definitely not obligated to share all of this with us so thank you for choosing to share, we love you
Hang in there Patricia, I pray for you and your husband. 🙏🏽always look back at how far both of you have come. Igbo girls don’t quit, we fight spiritually.
We're praying for you all the cross the pond in Boston, Massachusetts Patricia and your beautiful family - Ma African Sista Oooooh! 🌍🌍🌍
I’ve been going through the same with my second child, it’s like too many moments of having a huge mirror on ones self, I’m often watching myself in a silent movie. It’s gotten better as my little one has grown. I don’t know if it’s me growing or is it being a mom of 2 or is it quarantine it’s been so real.
OH MY DAYS, we love you soooooo much Patricia.... I teared up when you said 'my heart is warming up again' sending you so much love and peace x
This look is giving me meg the stallion vibessss
There is a great book by Garry Chapman called 4 seasons of marriage. It’s ok, us people want to break up bc suddenly we aren’t happy. We are not supposed to be happy every day, that’s not life that’s a fairy tale. I’m still learning that.
Sending lots of love to you ❤️❤️
Love your transparency! Thanks for sharing.
Patricia thank you for sharing this with us - I gravitate towards you cos I think we have similar personalities and it's also hard for me sometimes to admitt infront of myself that I'm not strong though this happens - especially in 2020 - as hard as this year have been on top of all challenges my mather passed away few weeks ago... and no matter how strong I felt I am - this has demolished me inside ... thanks to things I hear from you I can put some things in order in my mind and I want to thank you for that Patricia - thx a lot Kasia
Sending you good vibes ! And blessings!
Thank you for sharing your truth but don’t feel like you have too. Praying God keeps blessing you and your family. You girl all we can do is take it on day at time.
Sending love 💙
Think deep down if you have a good marriage, if the answer is yes then know that these storms are just temporary. I'll be married for 5 years this month with an 8 month old baby so I get it. It's been rough for us too but I talked to people who've been married for 20+ years and I thought about who my husband truly was to see if I'm just going through some things or if the marriage is actually bad. It does get better and it is worth it when you stick through it with someone that truly loves you. Wishing you the best
Great! You be you !!!
There is a video you did years ago where you told us that you will be using the name Bright you did mention that it wasn't your real last name. I remember watching all your achievements and seeing the name that didn't belong to you being used and I didn't understand why you wouldn't just use your real name. I'm so proud of the woman that you are! Thank you for sharing your life with us. you inspire me
Thanks for sharing your truth ❤❤
I am always here for all of you Patricia! All of it! Thanks for the video ❤️❤️❤️
When I first found you years ago, I loved that you didn’t look like any other skinny b*tch on the beauty platform. I loved that you did clothing reviews and strutted your stuff on camera. I loved that you have been open about your opinions about your body and have been honest and even though you may not be happy about your body, just know that you add value to this space!!! I continue to watch your channel because you’re so smart and funny and true to yourself! Honestly girl, you are so much more than your body!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you so much Patricia for sharing. It’s means a lot and it’s so relatable. I gave birth a month ago and they way my body has changed... my goodness. But like you said which I’ll take on board; appreciate what you have.♥️
We love u & praying for u & ur family. I know what u mean. This year has been testing all of our relationships but God is with us🙏🙏🙏.
Makeup tutorial please!
I admire your transparency, it's a good way to be. I admire you very much, you have done soo well so far. Good on you,  but if you want some extra support.-  You can join me for a meditation, yoga lesson we can zoom. Love you Patricia Bright...
So sad that when Youtubers get well off their marriages fall apart. I like Mike but we honestly don’t know what happens when the cameras are off.
U don't owe us the relationship bit that's your business. Stay blessed
Sending you love Patricia!💕 and I agree, showing emotions does NOT make you weak, if anything it makes you strong, def one the biggest things that I've been unlearning this year!
these comments are so encouraging — feeling the love. sending love to you
I very rarely comment but I have been watching you for years. I really wish you the best with your journey. You can do it!x
I'm here for the next chapter Patricia! xoxo
Do what's best for you I have been watching the chicnatural for years and I don't know what her husband looks like.
I agree with this
Focus on the next season. After winter must come spring. It's the way God intended things to be.
Sending you all the love❤️
Wow this was deep. Hang in there girl. Thank you for being brave
Praying for you and Mike; praying for us all! 2020 has been something different!!!!! So glad that you have recognized and addressed your needs! All the married ppl feel you! I pray that God continues to heal and reveal!
Two words... LOVE YOU❤️
Anyone else shook that her surname isn't Bright?!
Thanks for the transparency.  Peace
I have been watching you for yearsss and honestly as much as I love how you entertain and share your life you don't owe the world anything. You're doing great. We all have our ups and downs no pressure to be tops all the time. Your relationship will receive its miracle. Keep being who you are and no pressure, xoxo
Patricia just found your wedding video.. keep focused and positive. Sort out things together with your husband. You don't have to tell us all. We are all routing for you girl. God is love..
Thank you for sharing this generous part of your self with us. Being a woman has been married almost 29 years on September 7, I would just like to share with you that your marriage will continue to grow and be challenged over the years. I am sure that you know and understand that communication, really listening and actively making the needed adjustments is always key to the success. Remain mindful of why your marriage is important to the both of you. So many dream and pray for what you have right now. This quarantine has them desperate for what you have at this time even more. If nothing else this quarantine has us really thinking about our lives but we need to focus on our blessings. Open up to your partner and express your needs are and listening to what their needs.  Listen to each other and make the corrections as needed.   When you feel overwhelmed don't feel guilty to say I need a day, night or full 24 hours off. Sometimes you may need to just get a hotel room by yourself so that you can take care of yourself freely without guilt. I know it's very difficult to leave them in charge but it's important for you to refuel. It also give them a chance to understand what you do daily. You don't have to go very far from home, you can stay somewhere near as long as you get some solitude. The objective is no one is depending on you for that very short period of time. I got married young and these are things that no one shared with me.  Like all your other goals, dreams and aspirations  your relationship needs constant work, tweaking and modifications in order to achieve the long-term goal. Prayer and understanding will get you through the difficult times. Sending love and light from the US.
Thank you for opening up. It’s never easy to. You always brighten the people around you and it’s important to take care of yourself. You can’t help others feel bright if you don’t feel bright yourself ❤️❤️❤️
Love you Patricia ❤️
Im so glad you said "love the body youre in now because its just gunna keep changing"    GIRL, god knows I needed to hear that and god knows a lot more girls needed it to 💕💞💕
Lots of love to you !
look after yourself Patricia! x
<3
Hang in there....just know that you’re only accountable to yourself. God bless
Love 💛. From Zambia ♥️
“Seek God and he will find you”
Love love this video! You got this girl. 2020 has got us all thinking is this marriage worth it 🤣🤣🤣 being together all day everyday 🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️ that ish is testing!!!
I pray every situation leads us to know God deeper 💖
I have watch you from being a young teenager and I am a woman now. I have basically grown up watching you and all I can say is you a more than transparent enough. I dont think we need more from you. You make some of the best videos on the platform like its insane how relavent you have managed to stay all these years and this will never change. keep being you and wishing you and mike the best!
To the person who is reading this : You are amazing stay blessed, stay safe and have a wonderful day
Stay strong we’re all in this together love u
💚
The devil is a liar! Y’all need to pray hard! And I second someone saying you don’t owe us an explanation but if you want to let it out go ahead 🧡🧡
Thank you for this, Patricia♥️ Soooooo much wisdom in this one video. Love & Light 💡
We love you. We respect you. We respect your wishes. We understand your pain. We been here from Day 1 and we got you Patricia 💞
I am extremely excited about the new, more authentic Patricia content!!!!
Hey gal I loved that you were so open with us! I think we as a society should normalize talking about our problems, be it financial ones, romantical ones, health problems or anything really. I thin this is particularly important when it comes to social media influencers who have a high reach and are literally influencing (young) people by showing them how they live their life. I think it is good and healthy to be open and vulnerable -  for yourself, but also for your subscribers and fans, so they can relate and see they're not alone in feeling depressed/sad/angry/hopeless at times.  That said, if you don't want to share these things with the internet, don't do it please. Everyone should share what they feel comfortable with. For some people opening up is extremely therapeutic and a way to connect with others suffering from the same or similar issues, for others it is triggering and traumatic.  We will support you matter what, hope you know that <3
Why would you want to KEEP UP anyway? Be yourself.
I loved this video thank you for sharing with us and being open and keeping it real ! I’ve been watching you for years and feel like your my big sister. More videos like this as we get to see the layers peeled
You dont owe us anything but I have always held so much respect for you
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Trust in Almighty God.  Be intimate with your husband. Guard your heart because out of it flows the issues of life. Please do not expose a beautiful relationship that is going through challenges to millions of people, that will generate other  issues. We, subscribers,  also have personal issues and we don't share it with you    , you do not owe us that. Just saying that you are struggling is enough.  God has given you a spirit of love, power and a sound mind don't work against it. Keep your personality and may your family grow together in love.
I've been following you since before you were engaged and I absolutely love you more for being so real even though you've grown so much I am here for it and its truly inspiring <3 its a cliche but no one is perfect and with the whole cancel culture nowadays its proof that people need to stop expecting people that post their lives to *entertain* us that their lives are perfect. You are allowed to have off days, weeks, years, as long as your mental health and personal life is your priority then that's all that matters.
Girl i had my baby 10 years ago. And I still deal with body issues. It never goes away. You never truly return to the woman you were before children. Some people are just lucky if they do. Its ok you're not alone.
Sending love to you and your family. I hope you guys work it out. This year has been so tough and it has truly opened the door for problems we usually look over but you are a fighter and wish you all the best xx
I feel you I had a baby in may and experiencing postnatal depression and anxiety which I would not wish on anyone, it’s been a horrible year and this video has made me feel like I’m not alone x
So honest, and so much love in the comments ❤️ Sending you all the good vibes ✨
Thanks for sharing this awesome video,you are so helpful,I love your videos,    I buy the wonderful product from newigstyle..com last week
I needed to hear this today... thank you, but its true what everyone is saying, honesty is not full disclosure, you don't have to be open about everything, but I'm proud of you for facing your fears <3 lots of love!
💖💖💖💖💖
Love you Patricia! I prayed for you and Michael! Pls keep going strong!
I feel you so much in this video. I’ve been taking a break from IG for a month now just trying to get myself together. This year has been mentally exhausting. I’ve fallen in and out of depression and I’m just so over a lot of things. I thought I wanted to invite people a little more into my life on YouTube, but quickly realized I am a pretty private person and just don’t want to share that much. So now I’m stuck trying to figure out which direction I want to take my channel.  You don’t owe us too much of a deep look inside of your personal life. Your content is always appreciated, but your mental health and your marriage and family comes first. Wishing you all the best Patricia. Sending you good energy and lots of love. ❤️
I'd love to see a cooking video from you, I feel like that would be fun. Looking forward to seeing anything you continue to offer us. 2020 has been a mightily shit year, we'll get through it somehow. xx
We love you and we appreciate you! Thank you for feeling comfortable enough to share some of your thoughts and feelings with us. I know will continue to do so, but protecting your family and your marriage, if you both see fit, is priority. In relation to those two things you currently give the world the right amount of access without doing too much. Do we all want to know your business? Most of us, yes, but that doesn’t mean we need to. You have a beautiful family and I hope and pray that you guys are able to work on your relationship and foster growth and development in your lives. Again, thank you so much for chatting with us and I can’t wait to see what’s in store 💜 x
Hugs!!!
Patricia, I absolutely love you. You're special person. I appreciate you greatly.
HELP!  Mongolia. https://youtu.be/I9MYTuiwKK4,
You're such a ray of light and that doesn't change when you're honest. Take care xx
Awww... Giving you virtual hugs Patricia
I think you share enough. While I love the adorable chemistry between Mike and you; I don't need to know all of you all's business. Then the little things start to affect that goofy bond you two have. A little info but not a whole telenovela my dear.
❤️
I can really relate with this.. especially after dealing with a still born in March  , putting out consistent content allows you to build a facade of you feelings when the pain or depression is still really their, plus what’s going on right now really doesn’t help but we have to stay positive even when we do feel down and also be true to our selfs, sending love to everyone 🥰
❤️❤️🌹
I have felt so alone in all of this.. reading these comments and this video has helped me more than words can describe
Well cheers  to more deliberate thinking and doing 🥂 You are the creator of your experience ! Thank you for this amazing video. Peace and light 💕🥰
I know a lot of people are saying to keep your personal stuff personal but I could tell that this video was for you, not us and I am proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone and doing what you felt you needed to do.   I’m a perinatal mental health therapist and I recommend finding one in your area to talk. I can also consult with you if you want more information about what this type of therapy may look like.
We love you Patricia!!
Sending you lots of love Patricia❤️❤️
Thank you Patricia for wanting to be this open and honest about things. As some people already said you don't actually owe us anything, but we all appreciate your willingness to share more. There also is a lot of power in taking public commitments and that might help you stay on your desired track. Thank you for showing us women that it is ok not to have everything together at all times. Sending lots of love and hugs
I've been watching you for so long Patricia, I can always tell when you're not being your true authentic self. You should work on your self esteem babe. Always be you, everyone else is taken 🤎
This really shocked me. You never know what people are going through. We praying for you Patricia and Mike Xxx
Patricia - your extra stunning on this video ! Inside and out . Looking fwd to continue the journey with you . You are adored and APPRECIATED 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Realness 💯💯💯❤❤❤
You should have made enough money from YouTube to just get off now
Would love a tutorial on this makeup look
I feel like your focusing too much on youtube, as if you're trying to distract yourself from the mess that is you and your marriage by making brainless fast fashion youtube videos and trying so hard to go viral to give you some sense of worth. Idk what you're trying to prove by being a clown on here. I'd say take a brake from Youtube. Focus on Mike and your kids.
Love you💕
Patricia everything is going to be ok.  . Everything will be ok. 💕 I hope these 4 words bring you comfort.

If anyone can do it, it's you Patricia. I believe in you, we all do.
Before the video even started I liked it for this look!! Only Patricia can look gorgeous in oil spill!
Hi patricia,  I have been meaning to tell you this since I watch the vlog on your babies skin condition.  Lavender oil is good for eczema. It worked Wonder when I heard naomi Campbell. Mentioned it, that mom used to use it on her as a child.
Patricia please remember you are a YouTube OG. So many years I’ve been watching you. I love the way Mike pops in occasionally. But not all the time. You are such a genius and an inspiration to black women and mothers. Never think you aren’t doing enough. We love you xoxoxoxoxo
Pat please please be open minded into therapy as a couple. Mental health is important to us all, especially during these times in 2020.
DONT DO IT!
You don’t owe anyone anything Patricia, and I love your vlogs!💖💖💖💖
Keep it real with us! We will love you and support you either way!! ♥️♥️
I think your right p people like us tend to forget ourselves and take care of people instead of focusing on focusing ourselves
You are a beautiful person- inside and out! Amazing spirit!
Girl your openness is giving us courage to face our own realities as well.  I love you and 🗣 I AINT GOING NOWHERE!! Let’s keep being fabulous and looking forward!! 💄💋
2020 has turned my marriage upside down too... 😔💔😭 Thanks for your refreshing honesty.
I love your honesty! Stay strong! We are all here for each other!!
Thanks for sharing! We WILL get through! 🤗❤️
With God everything will be ok. Praying✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️ Jesus take the wheel.
Hi Patricia, I love your video, you and your family. Satan is using the pandemic to bring fear to people, and to separate people. Please do not have fear for anything, because God is with you, he loves you, and will get you through anything. As for your marriage, and being in the house together a lot, try these suggestions. Have a picnic, just the two of you, out in nature with a beautiful scenery. Have a date night, no kids. Go for dinner at a fancy restaurant, or wherever you like. Take a long shower together, lots of massaging, or light candles and surround your tube, fill with warm water and bubble bath, and the two of you lay in each other’s arms and reminisce about how you felt when you first fell  in love. Spend a good portion of the day in separate rooms of the house, then come together, for talk and play time, no kids, and get romantic or role play at night, and you know the rest 😉 I hope this help. Sending much love, hugs and kisses 😘🤗❤️
I absolutely love you. Please do what you need to for you. Peace and blessings.
Girl I’ve tried to leave my husband a few times, you’re completely and totally normal. Sometimes we argue all week long, sometimes we don’t argue at all. Some arguments are worse than others, but we just remember to  laugh at ourselves because most of the time we can’t even remember why we were arguing to begin with,  and have learned to love, love, love each other so much to where even when we do argue or disagree, it’s not as bad now.
Thanks for being honest girl 🧡
She's on her way out of the marriage, otherwise why would she be bringing this personal information to the public's attention?
Love you Patricia. I can’t wait for the real you to shine through even more. Be well.
Lean into your fears - I love this ❤️. U got this Patricia!
💕💕💕💕
#11 on trending and I'm watching this 2 days later
Sending love and light ❤. You're an inspiration to me, and I know you can get through this.
Appreciated this message..
She’s back!!!! With less or more transparency.. love you regardless girl ❤️
I believe I have been watching YouTube videos for about 10 years and this is my very first time ever liking and leaving a comment on someone’s video. I have been following you for years and you are actually the ONLY YouTuber that I keep following. I literally look for your new videos every week, both on this channel and on the break, and I believe the reason why I have kept following you all these years is because you are both entertaining and inspirational (always LOVE when you talk about business and when you take us behind the scenes of your business). Watching your videos felt like i was catching up with a friend when I moved to different countries, felt alone and didn’t know anyone. The authenticity of this video made want to drop my first ever YouTube comment, i guess to say you are loved, you are beautiful, you are inspiring and I hope you find infinite happiness.
Much love Patricia ❤❤ you are an amazing person
I just had my 2nd daughter a month ago. And I too am struggling with Postpartum. 😢
i no we cant right now but i wish i could give u a hug for being honest. i no everyone is saying u did not have to say all this and i agree but in a strange way its nice to hear. its relatable and i like that
I really appreciate this video tbh. Im really pleased to be on this journey with you
Patricia, you’re loved by so many  1. We all have relationship issues  2.  Being a mom is hard, don’t be too hard on yourself  3. Your body has been beautiful for a long time  4. Sending you lots of love and light 💡  5. Share only what you want, we’re loyal to your content not your personal life!
So much respect & admiration for this woman
I loved this video. I loved your energy, your vibe and the seeming joy and relief to be yourself on camera and do away with the facade. I’m here for it girl 🙌🏾😊♥️
To the person reading this! You’re beautiful and amazing! Don’t let anyone tell you different or bring you down💗✨ From a small YouTuber❤️
I don’t understand any of this.
Praying for you and the family. Love you 😚!
Sending you so much love! I really felt this🥺❤️
I’m a nurse on front line honestly I hear a lot of people are having issues with marriages during lock down I’m shocked I would think u would want your man with you during these times I mean honestly us nurses are out here risking our lives we wish we can stay home and cuddle with our hubby Iunno if it’s just me I’m just shocked that people are so depressed about lock down maybe it’s because I’m a home body and I don’t go anywhere so I don’t care I go to work pray I don’t catch the rona and I go home
I related to this on soooo many levels! Keep pushin sis, he won’t put anything on you, you can’t handle.
I’m so sorry to hear about your struggles. As for baby Nova, she’s going to be just fine by God. I can also say that you will be having another baby, middle children are always the most challenging.
so much love for you!!! blessings❤️
It was brave of you to open up like this. I will say the most shocking part of this video for me is that your surname is not Bright 😯
again youtube trending shit videos
Good Afternoon to all that's reading this, Hope all Is well in Jesus Name!!!!! This world is crazy and only going to get crazier, Were living in the end times. The Bible predicted all of this and it's coming to pass as were speaking right now.       JESUS LOVES YOU!!!.....The Kingdom Of God is at hand Repent and believe the Gospel and the good news was that the kingdom of Heaven had come near to us. The presence and the Glory of Heaven is available to us here; here on earth righteousness, joy and peace in the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17), the power of Heaven we could experience it right here in this world. Jesus said you could experience but you first have to Repent and make a decision to turn away from your sins and trust in Jesus. To Repent it means to return to God, Let go of your sins and return to God with all of your heart, Making a decision to turn away from your sins and following Jesus and believe in the Good news that's Christ Jesus on the cross payed in full for our sins (1 Peter 3:18). Jesus on the cross became sin so that you and I may become the righteousness of God ( 2 Corinthians 5:21) this is the good news that God came to bring us. Jesus was wounded for our transgression, He was bruised for our inequities: the chastisement for our peace was upon him and by his striped we are healed (Isaiah 53:5). You can receive this good news, Jesus came to bring us Eternal Life, Jesus came to bring us Forgiveness (John 3:16) and you can receive this great news today. The most Important decision you can make in your life today is to receive forgiveness and Eternal Life. If you have never received Jesus into your heart, If you have never asked him to come into your heart, and If you have never made this decision. You can make this decision right now God will forgive you of your sins, he'll give you life, and God will fill you with his Holy spirit. I want to encourage you today and simply close your eyes and pray this prayer from your heart to the Lord say:    Jesus I make a decision today to turn away from my sins and I come to you with all of my heart, forgive me Lord, cleanse my heart, give me a new heart   Jesus I receive you into my heart   Jesus I believe that you died on the cross and I believe you was raised from the dead and I believe your coming back soon   Jesus fill me with your Holy spirit I belong to you today and forever. AMEN!!!    If you prayed that prayer you just received Eternal Life!!! John 3:16 says that "that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have Eternal Life."  Jesus has just came into your heart through the Holy Spirit and you have been born again.
2020 we all need to draw closer to Jesus, or whatever spiritual belief anyone holds. Hold on to our loved ones, and truly live our best lives each day. Tomorrow is not promised.
Sending you lots of love, you legend. You’ve got nothing to prove to any of us x
I think you definitely can do it but also allow yourself to fall back. I was reading a Harvard Business Review about how resilience requires recovery, and I have to say: I see how you push yourself to be open and own your body, but at the same time you grew into the habit of crossing your hands in front of your belly. For reasons you mentioned already. And it's okay; people who expect you to look a certain way are just projecting their own expectations of what a female influencer should look like. Which you don't have to abide by.
Im proud of you for taking initiative to work on yourself and self reflect. Its not easy to face it head on and youre doing it. If you want to be more open for the sake that it will open YOU up then do it. Dont feel like you NEED to though. Youre giving me motivation to own my shit too boo. We got this
Be as transparent as you’re comfortable with... but not at the expense of possibly leaving your family vulnerable. It’s just given the current circumstances esp during 2020 the Internet/ social media  has been such a toxic space.. people are so quick to attack what you let them in on, even if it’s only 5% of your whole life.. idk I appreciate the transparency but tread w/ caution sis.. ppl can’t attack what they don’t know about 🤷🏾‍♀️❤️
We love you xxx
Bless you. I wish you courage, strength and so many blessings. live your life how you chose as 2020 has shown us all we cant take it for granted. I love your channel and I have so much resoect for you. Take care and always remember self care xx
You’re wearing Kaicollective❤️❤️ Anyway I hope you are taking care of yourself! We are supporting you all the way x
First, I want to say it takes a lot to be this vulnerable with us and we appreciate you for it. Be patient with your self, take it one day at a time. We're all rooting for you, also Matthew 11:28 Lay everything down at the feet of Jesus. Love yaa xx
I'm so happy about how open and real you are trying to be, love that you feel strong enough to make this shift. Love you!!
When you are not your true self you lose your soul. You end up being a shell of your true self and you live for other people's expectations. Be yourself, quit pretending. You are a beautiful woman who appears to be extremely intelligent and kind.  F those idiots, live your life.
Thank you for being vulnerable! I needed this! You got this Patricia!!! 🙏🏿
I've been here on your channel before your were  married ! Britpopprincess! Thank you for opening about all of these topics. So much women will or are  experiencing at least one of these. Disastasis and post-partum depression  : yeah it's me ! My second baby is 6 months old and quarantine as been very hard. My husband kept on working outside of the house during this tough time. (I'm french, sorry for my english). Give yourself  time to reconnect  to your true self and your needs. Love you!
This year was unexpected indeed...being quarantined (in the States) for 6 months now. Also, losing my mom unexpectedly on July 25th has literally put me in a place of sadness, loneliness, anger and confusion. She was my best friend and I have no idea how to move forward.   I commend you Patricia for sharing your story. You’ve always been a YouTuber I’ve admired for years now.
Thank you! Please carry on!
I felt this video so much ❤️❤️ I’m really struggling with the ups and downs of this time. Curveball after curveball. I can relate to so much of what you’re going through even when I’m not in the exact same place in life right now. Thank you sharing with us, I hope it feels good for you - sometimes sharing is cathartic. For every single hater or opinionated that are (literally on your channel 😂) 1000 of us who get it, who feel relate and feel empathy and an affinity and are lifted up by knowing we’re not the only ones going through something and who can lift you up too. Thank you for being so vulnerable, not because we want to see you down but because we know that you of all people will make it back ‘up’ and inspire us to do the same.
May you be Blessed with Wisdom and Guidance ❤️
Hang in there. We are rooting for you!
Girllllllll you dont owe  us NOTHING. Please  keep private things private and work things out.  The one thing i love about this channel is that you kept things that need to be private  private. We still love you and you doing amazing!!!
Marriage... it’s hard at times 😭
Not midwife mike!!!
Patricia, you are a superwoman keep your head up. Sending love
Hold up! 'Bright' is not your surname? I've been watching since your banking days. So shocked. LOL!
I do not owe anyone anymore because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
I feel like you don't have to share too much, because some things should be kept private. But however if sharing is therapeutic for you then who am I to tell you not to.
Yeah, I think I relate so much with what you said about your relationship and that a lot people have been going through stuff during this quarantine because I've also been going through them! It's like you don't realise that somethings going on, because you'd be enjoying moments with them, and easter, and birthdays but then when you have an argument that come from nowhere or from the tiniest little thing that could have been avoided, you realise that WTF!?!! Are we like being mentally affected by this quarantine.. because this year is HONESTLY the strangest time ever. The most, chaotic, sad, depressing time with current events ALL from different places in the world. I honestly feel, that some outside force is slowing and steadily knocking at my mental barriers and i'm projecting it towards my loved one, without me realising it until I'm forced with it.
Patty! I don’t know if you’ll even see this, but I want to say THANK YOU! Thank you for being open and honest about the Diastasis Recti. My youngest child was 8 this past summer, and I had basically just accepted the fact that for whatever reason, I was never going to lose my baby belly. It wasn’t until you posted a video and explained what it was that made your belly appear ‘still pregnant’ that I had my own lightbulb moment. I FINALLY have a diagnosis. I FINALLY know why I look 6 months pregnant. I FINALLY know what to do to start to repair the space in my abdominal wall. I’d been misdiagnosed with an umbilical hernia... I’m asked on a daily basis if I am pregnant... then I’m accused of trying to hide my pregnancy... but because of you, I am FINALLY able to move forward, in the right direction, to fix it. So, to you, I say a huge thank you. A HUGE, HUGE, BIG GIANT THANK YOU!!!! I know I’m only one person, but you’ve changed my life and I will never forget it! 🥰
What were these couples doing before covid.  They must wasn't around each other much but at night. So many couples breaking up
Thank you so much for sharing , sending you love and prayers ❤️🙏🏾
I think taking time to speak to someone, a therapist perhaps... about the way you view your body might be a valuable expense. I think within the black community, we normalise things that should not be normalised and overlook serious issues like body dismorphia, bulimia, depression. I'm not saying you have any of these but I think it's crucial that we explore what we are feeling with a professional who might be able to better guide. That and prayer.
great content as always..fellow Patricia fan , i am a new Nigerian youtuber residing in the Uk, pls check out our channel and kindly support us by subscribing . thanks
This vulnerability is so refreshing. Thank you for doing this 💛 hope things continue to get better from here on out x
LEAN INTO YOUR FEARS! If that isn't the testimony for 2020 idk what that is. Love your content and thank you for sharing. What you've experienced is a shared experience and we will all get through it bigger and better in the name of JESUS!
<3
I'm praying for you that things get better for you and your family 🙏
We are rooting for you darling. We already know some of this stuff is smoke and screen.  So don’t feel we will be devastated by your truths.  Who doesn’t want to have it all together? We all want to have it all together.  You gave us inspo, goals, by your posts.  Thank you.  In closing I want to say.  Please fight for your love!  We are rooting for you.
❤️❤️
Love how transparent you are. Please refrain from sharing your relationship with us. So many you tubers have had relationship issues because they were sharing their marriages with the public. Seek marriage counseling and go back to what made you fell in love to begin with. Take some alone time if you have to but fight for your family. It’s a crazy world out there. Lastly, girl you are gorgeous, ok. 😍😍😍
Keep your Marriage Privat ,try to solve things Home.Pray & Listen you are Amazing 🙏🏾
This is so honest and real. Thank you for sharing.
Hi Pat thanks for sharing!!!! 💜💛🧡❤️💜💛❤️💜💙💛🧡❤️Love you! Take care!!!!
Please work on your relationship...don't give up ! You have a beautiful family
Thanks for being transparent Patricia. Looking forward to seeing your new content

Well done for being so open. X
Patricia, you sound like you could use a good scream. Don’t worry, me too. Love you, hun
Love you Pat! Always an inspiration! 💕 i pray the best for you always! I appreciate all that you share with us, and will always respect what you choose not to, especially knowing that it’s for the good of yourself and your family. You are enough! Thank you! 💕💕
For the ones saying “you don’t have to share personal information,” On one hand, i agree with you but seeing someone you admire expressing real-life things makes one feel comfortable that we’re all in this together and we all have issues...maybe even similar issues, is comforting.
Patricia, Patricia!!! (Antics And ALL). We your Fans LOVE YOU SO MUCH ... Like Forever !!!   Any Ways, we definitely don't want things to be to messy with sharing all of your personal life. You as an example have reminded us to keep our personal personal business to ourselves.

FYI Just wanted to say You Patricia "Bright/Shadow/Glow" are doing Freaking Amazing!!

We love you Patricia ❤️❤️
Love you Patricia! Will support you always XX
My 9ja sis, do you.  Please do not do anything that will affect you, Mighty Mike or the children.  Youtube is a job and as much as I love seeing Mighty Mike and the children, your mum, sister in the Videos it is about sharing what you feel comfortable sharing.  Everyone is entitled to their privacy.  In life always remember "Prayer is the Key to the day and lock at night". Do not let anything come between you, your husband, children and family.  Not YouTube, social media, work etc❤️
The mind and body do be doing way too damn much! From the time we get our first period until we die! It’s honestly sick
I have been following you for a while and your videos and posts always help me come out of a darker place. I may not be able to do the same for you but whatever you choose to do, I hope you know that i (along with many other of your fans) will be there to support you no matter what!
Oh honey do you girl! I've always enjoyed your channel because you've always done your own thing. You don't owe us anything, keep on being you!
I needed this video!! Patricia you’re a legend!! You’re inspiring and you’re pushing me to live my truth regardless of my fears! 2020 is going to finish strong, despite the last couple of months. Thank you for helping me to see this. 😍♥️💯
Thanks for your transparency. We are all struggling. Praying for you and your family. I will be a subscriber for life. You are a gem😊.
We see you, we love you, we support you!
This makes me feel better https://youtu.be/QIiVyKJyS50
I can't get my mind around people being nasty toward you.  You provide a FREE to us SERVICE of entertainment, enjoyment, and time away from our own daily struggles.  I'm sorry these dark souls have hurt you, for you certainly don't deserve it.  Thank you for your honesty with the physical issues, your fears and worries about your children's welfare, and your stresses with your spouse, as we are all dealing with it, and it is a sad reassurance that this global pandemic has affected everyone in so many of the same ways.  You're a delightful and brave woman to hike up your knickers and post your videos even when you're struggling.  God bless you and your family.
You are a Real, Amazing and Beautiful person. Keep up the good work and keep being you xxx
So happy to see you Patricia!!! I think being quarantined has opened everyone's eyes about themselves. Good, bad or in between!!!  Thank you for sharing!!!  Reaching out with love from Las Vegas!!! Stay strong!!!
Pat, if you need to take some time off, slow down a bit and focus on your family, please do it. Youtube and your loyal subscribers will always be here waiting for you. You should not be under pressure to keep doing or delivering stuff if you need to take a moment for yourself.  If being open is what you want, but it could cause discomfort to others (who matter) then please reconsider that step. Life is all about compromise after all. People who watch you will always watch you, I know I will. In the meantime, we are living their lives as best as we know how to. So please do you and your family too. Sending you hugs and alot of well wishes.
I stopped my job thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Marriage is HARD!! Take some time and focus on what brings you true happiness. YouTube will always be here. Your family will not. Fight for mike and your family. Remember the reasons you fell in love and make a great team. Hang in there!
*My last name is not Bright. Girl whet?* 😂😂
I needed this! I have a 3 year old and just broken up with my partner after ten years as I found out in quarantine he was cheating on me. I have felt utterly broken and felt so alone. So to hear someone so beautiful and powerful be so open and honest makes people like me feel like we are not alone. Thankyou. But also, you don’t need to put pressure on yourself, you are a fantastic mom, buisness owner, financial guider! Thankyou! I hope you feel better soon, sending all my love
I think the only thing I heard was that you and Michael have had some problems during quarantine. That makes me so incredibly sad. I think you two are so good together!!  I will pray that you are able to get past your differences and will have many, many many more years together!  ❤️❤️
I know you want to share but please don't share toooo much of your relationship this part of your life is special. I understand you feel like you're being fake. You're not this is your life you are an entertainer. There are things that you are allowed to keep private. And in regards to the FUPA gurl get it sorted. We can tell you feel uncomfortable plus your core must feel soo weak. We support you.
We love and pray for you through your trials!
If sharing your personal life online has any negative effect on your relationship it's not worth it. Your family comes first!
WE LOVE YOU PATRICIA!!!! I know you believe in God so continue to pray and don't worry my grand-mother told me that "in every situation there is a beginning and an ending".... God bless you and your family 2020 Show us the real ....but nevertheless we still in life Keep Pushing
I'm glad you're back to being yourself.  Share what you want. Save your marriage.  Trust God at all times. Do not dwell on negative comments!!!
We have only one real place to call home and thats the body we are in. Love and cherish it with grace and gratitude. Serve it with love. I know this is easier said than done but just stop and think, why do otherwise? Health is more than appearance, wellness is our greatest wealth!
<3 sending you love! I look forward to your videos and your next chapter x
My sister had her 2nd baby and looked pregnant for months later as well. After being in constant pain for literally months she finally found out her also had a hernia. There is so much they don’t tell you! I completely agree, why live with something you don’t like if you can change it and no longer live in physical and mental pain 💕
YES. Thats what im saying. U will never be satisfied nor happy when u get ur body done. People dont realise that you will still be very insecure. I applaud u for saying this with the big publicity that u have! U are so real i love it! Keep your head up high in Jezus name Amen🙏🏾
Patricia I have watched you grow from your uni days! Change happens when we gracefully and humbly learn from it! We all have been there and know that beautiful unions take work and effort. Keep on shining and growing, love!
I love you for you're being real no matter what internet says about you you've inspired me alot
Tight warm hugs 🤗. We love you.
❤️❤️❤️
Sending you lots of love! I know you and Mike can work it out and grow stronger together. 💕
Sending you lots of love! I know you and Mike can work it out and grow stronger together. 💕
*hugs*
Patricia, thank you for having the strength to share. You are an amazing person!!! As long as there is willingness, there is a way for things to work out. Sending you love, stay kind, stay humble♡♡♡
I LOVE you& your honesty!!! Thank you for sharing& making me feel normal in a sense. You are beautiful inside& out!! Look forward to seeing more of your true self!❤❤❤❤❤
You owe us nothing. Whether you give us the gift of yourself or not is your decision. I hope you take the time needed to repair and rebuild the relationships that matter the most: the relationship with yourself and your life partner. We will be here when THAT work is done. Love you girl. Hugs from Texas. :)
I’m off of social media because of the whole “pressure to be...” and at first I was like “wth am I going to do with myself??” But you know what!!? Best decision made this year.
You keep it so real... this why you   really love your hun
You are worthy.
Your right am married too and it’s not been easy
Love you Patricia...please take care of yourself and your family. And I honestly don’t think you should share so much of your relationship. I’m also thinking about going more private on that side too💕
Pat, you are a very smart and intelligent woman.  Stop beating up on yourself the image you project is fine. We need more ladies in this world like you. Do what ever it takes to save your family not us.
You are so beautiful as you are Patricia. You don’t need to look back and think ‘I looked good back then’ you look so good now!!! Wish you could see it
You generalize a Lot in this Video. If you want to change focus on you :)
Love this transparency
I'm excited
It’s always hard putting yourself out there but such moments makes us relate with you more. We are going to make it through the yet together. Keep your head hand keep going sis 🙌🏾
It's brave of you to share these updates of your personal life with everyone, especially since people can be extremely aggressive and opinionated on the internet. You and Mike make such a beautiful and funny couple so I truly hope y'all work through this bumpy road called life :) all the best!
2 Timothy 3:1-5
I’m actually quite happy with this year. I learned a lot! I let down my emotional guard I’ve been building for years- but I let go of the fear and I allowed myself to feel and express my emotions. I feel in love, and allowed myself to experience it....unfortunately it wasn’t for long but ended in a great neutral way.
Your seemingly trueself is so charming! you brought tears into my eyes as you match so strongfully what I was about to say after this almost post-covid time, and I'm quite sure a lot of us think the same. Sorry for my English for I'm French and at least this one word can't be wrong translation: THANKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx!
Tell me about ittttttttttttttttttttttttttttt 😩
Patricia you are so smart, beautiful, sweet, and strong. We all break down sometimes and there's nothing wrong with that. These times are especially challenging, but this too shall pass. I love all of your content and think it's great you want to switch things up! You'll always have my support 💖
I love you Patricia .....I'll be thinking about you
God bless you and your family 💖 I will be praying for you. This has made realise that we should appreciate what we have when we have it.  Godliness with contentment is great gain. Lots of love Patrica 💕
what is going on today! Up up up to patricia
We're  here for you Patricia. We got  your back honey.❣
You have done so so so much for women all over the world - as a black girl I have learned a lot from you, what I appreciate most is as time and life changes I continued to learn from you during my student days I’d come on to learn about makeup and fashion from you now as adult starting out my career I could still come on your other channel to learn about financing and adulting. I also agree with the comment below that you don’t owe any of us any bit of transparency. Wishing you the very best with everything continue to keep Jesus at the centre of it all. He will never fail you Much love and light to you and your family. ❤️
thank you so much for sharing especially about the body part :)
I agree. When you are a mom with children who have any sort of special needs you switch all of your energy immediately into being a caretaker....Because you have to....Often neglecting your own physical and mental health. It took me years to realize I went through some post traumatic stress in this area. Be gentle with yourself... take your time. I’m here for the real ness Patricia!!
Love you and your honesty Patricia. This has been the most difficult year of my life, dealing with both physical and mental health issues. It pains me that everyone is suffering so much in their own ways. Just know that you aren’t alone, and also to do what feels right for you. You don’t owe us transparency, but if you feel that’s what you want to do, then follow that. Wish you the best.
I can’t tell you Patricia how helpful this video really was for me. I’ve watched you for years and years always admired and looked up to how funny and genuine you are, but also how ‘put together’ you are. I consider myself a relatively vulnerable person in terms of allowing myself to compare myself to others who are ‘doing better than me’ so I always try to take what influencer’s/celebrities/youtubers present themselves with a pinch of salt because you truly never know what they might be going through shined closed doors. I also find you in particular so endearing and relatable (probably because we’re both British 😋). I just wanted to say thank you for being so real and so open about your life no matter how scary it is for you (I could never, I really admire you for it), for young women such as myself, creators like you are priceless. Though it’s unimaginably scary to admit the realities of your life in the internet, just know you’re making an enormous difference to young people who needs to see it’s not all rosy and perfection 24/7. You’re very inspiring, thank you for all you do. I hope you and your husband and those beautiful babies of yours are well. Take care of yourself ❤️
❤️
Aww we love you!! It will all be alright mama! Things will work themselves out and you'll continue to shine as bright as ever! 💞
I just want to say that I have started watching your old videos again to cheer myself up just because of your happy-go-lucky personality. Thank you for making this video to help me realize that we're all real and we're all in this struggle of 2020 together.
💖💖💖
Amazingfacts.org, hopetv.org,  3Abn,  these site are in-depth bible study.  Prayer still works.  It’s a very depressing times.  Lean on Jesus.
Thank you for sharing❤
2020 is like a cursed year , so depressing and scary, so much changes . I feel you girl, you’re not alone, everyone is going though something this year and so much emotional challenges. But as you said life is short let live it the best we can.
First and foremost thank you for being so honest and allow us into the not so glamorous side of your life but the true and authentic you. In quarantine I’ve come to many revelations and hard truths which is a working progress (and will always be) but I’ve recently have been reading a book called ‘Dare to Lead’ by Brene Brown which talks about the power of leaning into vulnerability. The more vulnerable we are the more truly happy we can be as we allow ourselves to be our authentic self. I’ve also have been putting more faith in God and reading the bible, one scripture that has been encouraging is what Paul said in the bible in 2 Corinthians 12:10 “For when I am weak, then I am powerful.” With acceptance of who you are and trust in God that he will provide you with guidance to get through life we become powerful. I will be praying for you and your beautiful family, keep your head up hun 💖
What's crazy is seeing people post about married couples and saying dumb shit like "you must not really love your spouse if this quarantine hasn't brought you together". Um, we are dealing with a damn pandemic (potential job loss, fear of getting sick and potentially dying, emotional and mental stress, etc), racial unrest (dealing with Black and brown people being murdered in the street with no justice), the foolishness in the White house,  etc. That shit takes a toll on not only a person but a relationship as well. I've been an essential worker since the world went to shit and when i would get home and see my husband on the couch and immediately get irritated. This shit is stressful. I said all that to say, it's been rocky for my husband and i during this quarantine and  that's fine.we should not be shamed for not being the perfect couple everybody else claims to be. TF
Being strong doesn't mean being perfect. I'm sure being a business woman and responsible for other people, plus a new born with the skin problems she had and caring for your family was a LOT to deal with. Then add covid...it's been mad. Think we all need to take time to remember the basic joys of life and love and slow down. Really hope Patricia and Mike work it out, there's a lot of love still there ❤
Patricia I've always thought you were beautiful inside and out. Thanks for being brave and sharing with us. We love being with you on this journey ❤️
Girl, you get as many surgeries as you want, as long as they make you feel more confident in your own skin. No one has a right to question any of the decisions you make about your own body. I hope this new chapter brings a lot of happiness and strength for you and your family. You are so powerful!! Keep going and everything will get better soon! Sending lots of love!
Staint Johns Wort vitamin supplement works wonders (mem /women) for mild depression, stress, pms, bad attitudes.  Also this is just an opinion not a suggestion but I feel couples divorce to quickly.  Separation for a couple of years can work to reconnect. Allows for self growth, experience the side of life, time alone,, but still co parent.  I wish you and family better days.
Thank you for being vulnerable. Thank you for sharing. You don't owe us a damn thing but I appreciate you sharing. Sending you love and healing. Always wishing you well.  AND DON'T TELL THESE CRAZY ASS PEOPLE YOU'RE FULL NAME. LOL  ALL LOVE *SOKU
So happpy for you! Thrive Queen , and we love you in your full self always. Your vulnerability is inspiring, and something we all take to heart by seeing. Thank you for sharing with us and being so brave
I applaud you for being so open and real! I'm excited for the next chapter of your channel and support you all the way <3
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for sharing Patricia. Honestly, this helps. It helps other women who are also struggling with the pressure to appear perfect. It helps us. It does.
Don’t try to force it. You don’t have to share any more than what you are comfortable with. Don’t try to do anything but what works for you and your family. This pandemic is not ending anytime soon so we all have to roll with the punches.
Sis thanks for your openness with us that helps so many of us we are with you thru your journey be bless and be true to your self MUCH LOVE.
Patricia, this too shall pass. Seek therapy even couples if that helps but for yourself first of. If you’re spiritual and involved in church find an accountability and prayer partner or a woman’s group to help dealing with it from that angle. The Bible has a lot to say about being hopeful even joyful in the midst of dark spaces. You’ve got this and God’s got you! 🤗
I've been watching you for a few years now and I've always loved your spirit. Your spirit was what drew me to watch. No one lives at 100% all the time. Life is all about seasons some good some bad. Continue to live in your truth and continue to put your family 1st. Everything else will fall in it's place. I'm here for the content change, growth and change is evidence of life. Only dead things stay the same. Wishing you and your family peace and happiness.
I love your videos! I live your personality and the fact that you broke down and were transparent in this video made me love you even more! Thank you for bringing us along on your journey! You are perfect the way you are but do what makes you happy!
Baby girl:  It is okay. You are human just like the rest of us. This Covid shit has everyone om edge, has our relationships with family and friends on edge. You are a beautiful, loving person and i pray everything gets better for you. You gotta take it day by day. We all love you sooooo much. ❤💯
Hi Patricia.  For women with diastasis recti with a hernia it is in fact beyond just s insecurity.  It tears at you mentally so much and the physical issues that come with it makes it worse.  Do what's best for you.  All the best to you and your family.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💜💜💜💜
I think you are really admirable. ^_^ You've been through a lot.
First of I feel for you nobody deserves hard times. I pray that everything will get better! I really believe that no matter the situation you as husband and wife need to press trough it together. You are stronger that way. Communication is so important and can help in deep situations. I send you love, guidance and self love. You are awesome and lovely and gorgeous and amazingly beautiful. ❤❤❤❤❤
We love you so much girl! I hope you know how much you are appreciated and loved in this platform.
Yesss Mama !!!
This is the best video you have ever filmed 🥺
YOU ARE A QUEEN!!! Didn't think I could love you more but this video did it! You're an inspiration & always remember, 6ou don't always have to be ok. Nobody expects that of you (other than maybe yourself!). Stay strong, we love you!
Marriage ain't easy...it's a school for me. It's has its ups and downs, happy times, sad times, full on tsunamis and calming rivers. I do not know you guys I know what you show which is not always the truest of pictures. My advice would be to reevaluate the foundation. Sometimes we really need to go back to the beginning identify what the relationship was build on. Put pen to paper and really see the relationship in black and white, it's progression, where it moved from to where it is today. And make active steps to rebuild or start a fresh in the change. Because ppl change they never stay the same and most times we forget that and we want  to live in the honeymoon phase we were and that's just not possible. Sometimes we even gonna do some alone time reflection to identify how I have changed and to identify what I now need in my relationship. I'm sending love your way Pat...be blessed hun
We love you Patricia 😘
What an incredible way to use your platform! You are an amazing woman, and I love your courage! Do what enriches your spirit.
You can do it. You WILL do it.  And we will be here for you through it all.  Periodt. 💛
We feel you love 💕 and we are here for whatever you wanna post :)
This year has been so tough and emotionally draining for most of us😭
💖 thnx for sharing. Hope everything will be better soon
This video makes me love Pat more, honestly. I admire that you choose to be authentic and genuine especially when you do not have to at all. It makes people want to relate to you and support you more. I’m here for it
We love you!! Praying for healing & restoration in all areas in you and your fam’s life! This pandemic has been hard af!❤️
U look stunning !! May our Lord grant you peace and more joy
I don’t think people will judge you. I honestly if I may say so myself ur try on videos were really fun and I know you feel “more” confident after you had the tummy  tuck
And Patricia is you want to fix ur body it’s okay please do it if you want to!!! All love baby!!! Happy for you :)
I really enjoyed the time when you have a vlogging Channel and just watch u doing errands :) i remember u say u make those videos literally for you n mike to watch :)
How can you not love Patricia
You are such a wonderful person
Thank you for your transparency. God bless you and your family and everything you are trying to achieve
God Bless you and just know that you are walking in your purpose. God is using you mightily. It may not seem that way to you but He’s happy with you. Continue to remain honest and true. We love you at whatever rung you are located ... on your ladder in plans God has laid out for you. Marriage takes work! So just keep working at it the great thing is that you are both working at it “together” and that my dear is powerful. Just know I’ll be praying for you.
You are amazing 😩😩😩 such an inspiration
Omg YESSSS I’ve been wanting more vlog-type videos from you!
Sending you lots of love 💕 take care of yourself...
People need to remember the importance of privacy for celebrities, YouTuber/blogger/influcers. People should also be more kind than just blurting assumptions. Just imagine would you want to live your life 24/7 for years till you die in big brother house under cameras for your whole with no privacy and constant criticism. It could feel like that for people who share their talent or due to their job are online more. Show some compassion and grace . Thanks for sharing Patricia sending you positive energy and prayers xx
Oh, Patricia! You are growing. This year had challenged all growing women to blossom. You are now ready to show up as your most confident self. You are the verge of a personal breakthrough- I’m one who can tell. I’d love to send you a little something in the coming months. Plus a big hug. 💙🤗
Love this Patricia! Bright or not, you're doing amazing sweetie!
Thank God,  your little  girl  is doing so much better, went through something similar with my daughter. Wishing you well in this season!!!
Good on you! I think most people have had to face themselves and the reality of situations effecting them during quarantine. I believe we’re all doing the best that we can. The payoffs will be worth in the end.
I love your top... can you share where you purchased it from.
Thank you for sharing Patricia. I think you have always been transparent and authentic, it’s fair enough for you to keep those parts of your life private! However I am looking forward to the changes you are bringing 💕💕
Saaaameee I feel mentally impacted as well because of covid
I fully understand what you went through, I have a video on postpartum experience on my channel guys, please go check it out ❤️❤️❤️  This year has been a lot.
Thanks for sharing Patricia, you got this.  People will always think what they want to think, no matter what you do. I believe your subscribers will be there, so I look forward to seeing the new content.
Live in the moment
💛💛💛
Patricia have you seen skin decisions on Netflix, there is one segment there that deal with a diastasis Recti scenario. DR is the pits. I did a hernia repair as well. Yep I still look pregnant 🤰🏾 three years after, but I deliberately enjoy my life and daily make gains at achieving my aspirations, knowing that eventually I'll have to get D. R surgically  sorted if I can't close it through tva exercises . 7 cms  is very wide baby girl.  You do what  is right for you baby girl. Besosxoxo 😘 💕
I followed you a long time ago because I was looking to follow more successful women of color. I think that being successful looks different to everyone and is different at different times in our lives. Do whatever it is that makes you feel joy Patricia!
7 months postpartum and I feel you Patricia. Well wishes to you and your family your definitely not alone in your feelings ♥️
Girl do YOU
Firstly, thank you for being transparent with us Patricia! Praying for your mental peace. Praying your family, health and your marriage. I love love love you and Mike and hopefully whatever difficulties you are going through can be fixed! ✨Virtual hugs ✨
We love you so much, thank you for being vulnerable. Love you even more.
Sending my love and prayers ♥️♥️☹️☹️
Patricia this is a great video darling.
🤔🥰
Sending all the positive blessings from afar!!!!!! We love you Patricia!!!
I just love you! It’s so hard to share personal issues with loved ones let alone the internet. There are so many things you said that really hit home. But one thing I love about you, is you don’t stop. You continue pushing forward to get to a better space mentally emotionally  physically.  Praying for you And Mike that God continues to bless your journey ❤️
Love this video Patricia, I feel 2020 has done this to people and it can only be for the better. Can’t wait to see what you have in store always routing for you xxx
I’d also just like to say briefly, your body is beautiful Patty. Your body birthed 2 beautiful children. It allows you to walk and breath and love. I know it’s changed and that scares you... but remember what bodies are made for. You did the damn thing and you’re glowing. Do what you need to do to be happy but love yourself in the process.
Thank you so much for sharing! This really struck a cord in me. You really confirmed for me that it’s okay to go through things and how I’m feeling is okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I feel a little less crazy knowing that we all go through the same things.
Ugh you had me so scared for you and Michael, Patricia!! Thanks for being so open with us. I’m happy for you that you’ll be able to fix your hernia and your post pregnancy issues.
Been watching you for about 7 years and feel like this is the first time in a long time I have seen the real deep, lovely, vulnerable Patricia who I fell in love with. I miss your more emotional videos and I admire you for being so raw and honest. This would have taken great courage to post ❤️ take time to work on yourself and your family and your mind ... we will all be here behind you backing you, unwaveringly xxx
Bless you, Patricia. Sending positive vibes to you and your gorgeous little family xx
Patricia, I always noticed how much importance you put on social media and the need to look a certain way on platforms like Insta, I dont know you but I appreciate your journey with authenticity.  As an elder i will say that authenticity is a legacy , and a good one.  You discovered it way before I did, congratulations.
Love you lady...we support everything you do
A lot of respect for you after doing this video. Even more than before. ❤️
Sending you love Patricia! This year has been rough on all of us, glad you to hear you are using it to share your truth and live your best life for real❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for being transparent! Love you too!! 😘💕
Listen, youuu are not aloneeeeee (in my Michael Jackson voice) I'm sending you major,major internet love & most of all encouragement.
Thank you for being so candid, a lot of us can definitely relate. I just wanted to add that I feel as though you have definitely gotten the balance right in the sense that your person and your intention really comes through irrespective of your content. Its a really hard place to get to so well done for doing that! I honestly think its part of the reason I've been watching you from 2009, your growth and story is unreal. I'll continue to watch you for as long as  you would like us to ❤. Hope this year ends better than it been going thus far xx
Wow! Love you even more Patricia, you are an amazing woman. So much respect for you ❤️
Praying for u & your family, God is a very present help, in a time of trouble🙏🏾
God bless you Patricia.  2020 has been hard for the whole wide world.  You got this ❤
Who dislikes this?! Why- i dont get that?
You are getting stronger and better. Just as you told us plainly,do tell God your mind and plans He already knows anyways but He will make it easier for you. Your issues are just exactly as mine if not similar but we move! I add you to prayers. It is well.Keep your head so high as ever. I love you and your lovely family. Stay blessed!♥️👸🏾
I ain’t ever gona stop lovin u bish
Thank you for being so HONEST✨🌟 Patricia. It takes a real woman of substance and strength to share like that.👏👏 It also shows us that everyone is hurting in some way or another and that we are not alone in this ugly time. I have been a subscriber to all your channels for a very long time and this has been the most transparent, open and vulnerable you have been. Thanks for opening us to us!!😍😘
Firstly, I’m praying for you and your marriage! Secondly I’m excited about your new adventures!!
Easy to lose yourself running business/es, relationships,wife,mother. The world can be on a woman’s shoulder more often than not. Quarantine is crazy this is not normal for anyone. My husband and I went into therapy for a few sessions as it met boiling point but we been doing better since then so I hope you get through it 🙌🏾 Look after yourself & take some time for self face 🖤
I just feel like you need a virtual hug sis !!! You are gonna be alright, God has got you and your  YouTube family is here to support you !!! 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
I love how honest you have always been, I've been watching you from britpopprincess days we love you cant wait to go on this new journey with you
Hey girly, yes these months have bought out realness around the world, so best to be real for yourself and strong at the same time always. Yazzz life is short and long to what u make it so might as well be happy in it. As women we all would like to fix those body areas that’s change from situation & I’m all for it in every way so, LADIES DO YOU ITS ALL RIGHT WE LIVE ONCE LOOK & FEEL BEAUTIFUL for yourself. DO YALL AGREE? @Valstube💕
Patricia, I’m sorry that you are going through all this but I really enjoyed the video—your openness and honesty is highly appreciated and I’m sure these kinds of videos help a lot of us as we think we’re the only ones suffering and everyone else has it all together but clearly it’s not the case 😘
This is so relatable right now! This year has been challenging a way I've never experienced. Thanks for being honest.
Am I the only one shook that her last name is actually not “Bright”?
Speak the truth, live honestly, be respectful and give thanks.
Best video you've done this year (along the video about your daughter Nova in May). I respect and appreciate the fact that you want to change things around and be more true to yourself, I was still going to be a supporter regardless, but now I have EVEN MORE to look forward to.  Much love & blessings from Copenhagen xx
Pls whats the plants in your background
this year is really hard emotionally. i am already tired of this year...
Aww Patricia ❤️
I respect the fact that you know you don’t have it all together but you’re working on it
🦋L😘YOU PAT🦋
Thank you for sharing something so real, raw and honest, Patricia. It's so easy to get caught up believing that your favorite YouTubers have perfect lives.  Thanks for sharing parts of yourself that we all struggle with. Wishing you and Mike the courage, love and perservance you need to push through this difficult phase in life xx
Sending you love and light ❤️
Thank you for the video ❤️
😻Almost To 2 million Queen😻 😘Your gorgeous self😘 😍Makeup look Good😍 😗Keep ur head up😗 🤗Happy Bless WeeK🤗 😇😇Stay Safe Too😇😇
Love this Patricia. It's so important to recognise and reflect things you want in life. It's so important to have a partner with you through that journey but only if you help each other through life rather than pull each other down.  Lockdown has been hard on everyone's relationships and I love that you went away, sometimes you need some time together without the stresses and fall in love with your partner again.  I have body issues, I had a heart transplant and I've gained 3 stone in a couple of years. As much as I love my body because its so strong, its hard to not feel like I look myself. Its hard and its okay not to be okay all the time! Hang in there, you'll look back on this time and be proud of what you over came ❤️
Omg girl that made me so emotional and I can't wait to see your new chapter I love all of your vids but defo being more confident in sharing your life is scary but more relatable and you never know there's always someone out there that can help if needed. Love you boo xx
I’m glad you are going to be making more videos! Especially during this pandemic we have to really bring it back to Jesus and lean on him to support us and strengthen us because we CAN’T do it alone. Much love Patricia!! 💕💕💕
Love your honestly and authenticity Patricia! It’s what makes you unique and actually relatable. Love what you do!
This video was very much needed, thanks for ur sincerity, keep living your truth
2020 has been a year for trying every emotions that you have and some that you did not want to deal with. I felt this vlog because I have had some self doubts and still working through them. Thank you for sharing. Love you and your family.
We love you and you got this xxx
I barely comment but proud and inspired by you for this genuine update. Love Gen x
Patricia this was so brave to put yourself out there. All your followers have your back whether you choose to keep your personal life more person and we understand this! You're only human and the internet can be alot! Girl you've got this, 2020 has been no easy year and a year alot of us are facing our demons xx
My darling Patricia, I am an older woman to you and you have been a constant inspiration in ways that you could not imagine.  Lean on your inner spirit you have the right to look after your wellbeing.   As you said none of us is promise tomorrow so big up yourself Nuff love and respect sweety ❤💚💛
We must not allow these unprecedented times to take the better part of us.  Stay positive and think of all the best things that have happened in your live and embrace your loved ones
I hope things get better- we love Mike and we can see how incredibly supportive he has been <3
Wish you all the Best love your videos 🙏🏾❤
Patrícia giving me major meh thee stallion vibes with this look
You made me cry. You don't owe us anything but do not underestimate the good it does to see someone talking like that. Nobody talks like that around me, colleagues, family or friends. It's all boiling inside and I'm looking around wondering how people do to pretend like everything is ok right now, it's not. Or even worse makes jokes about it while I'm trying to talk about real issues
Patricia thank you for sharing your truth. Know that you are not alone, everything you shared many of us struggle with. Being a woman,  if only we were all more real and transparent we would all realize that the issues we face are universal. You will persevere because that’s who you are, an overcomer. God is always with you,  draw strength from Him in everything that you face. Love from Texas!
I know a lot of people are commenting saying you shouldn’t share your marriage issues. Whilst this is true, I really admire you doing this, it’s made me feel less alone, thank you. ♥️
I pray you will come to know God ❤️ So much love ❤️❤️
postpartum is the hardest thing ever❤️ Take it easy Mama 🥰
you are so amazing and strong. i wish you could see yourself through my eyes!! thank you for this video. all is going to get back in place (even if things “don’t work out” as you thought). love you xx
Patricia, please focus on your intimacy with Christ. In him you will find peace. You are beautifully made in his image. Go to him and he'll tell you that too
amazing xxxx
most importantly; wheres the top from???
You can do anything Patricia! Face those fears! Sending love x
You look amazing! You share enough, you are enough! I'm more shocked your name isnt Bright 🤣 love you Patricia ❤️
You’re the realest 💕🤍
Not going to lie I thought that BritPopPrincess was Mrs Bright.   What a shock
I don’t post comments much but just felt I had to reach out and say that your aura is amazing. You will get through this. Loving your personality x
omg this is soooo HD & crisp.
Pat you should read untamed by Glennon Doyle, it fits perfectly to your struggles. It took so much weight off of my shoulders 💕
Thank you for sharing Patricia
2020 has been a painful but transformative year for me👏🏽 Love this content tho, more please!!!❤️
Awww good luck Patricia, despite everything that’s going on you still look bright in your videos ☺️ keep it up stay positive.
Dude me and my man too! We love each other and have a strong bond but we’ve hit some moments where we just had it with each other. Our attitudes are high level and we can’t shake it sometimes. But we’re working on it, things got better and are still getting better. In Jesus name Amen. 🙏🏽 God bless your family
I'm really glad you posted this. I met someone really special just before this hit and it's been trying for us too. We've all got to stay strong and work on ourselves and our boundaries. Everyone needs some me time and I don't think we've been getting enough.
Love you Patricia!
Literally what I needed to hear right now Patricia. Be open to your new found vulnerabilities, and smash this new chapter!!!
You and Mike have totally got this keep faith in eachother X
This year it has been  really  bad and life is really  too short as you don't know if you will be there  the following  day,and we need to be kind and  to love  one another and mostly  to be  with God  all the time,and stay blessed  and let God be there  in your family  to guide  you  and protect you.
I’m here for the more heart on your sleeve Patricia!! I’ve missed her 😘
Please dont let the pandemic ruin your marriage. I personally love you guys together
You are not alone. I believe what you are going through it normal for our current situation. I add meditation into your routine. I believe it can help. It has helped me. There is an app called  ‘Balance’  it’s free. It teaches meditation.  You have been doing a lot. You have been carrying a heavy load. You are not able to really get away due to the quarantine.
Everything will be alright ❤️
Hang in there lovely 😘. You're doing the right thing now whilst u r still quite young; addressing physical and mental issues, as this will greatly impact u when the time comes for the big M!... Yes!! Woman's sufferhead goes on, but with a healthy body and mind, u just may not notice it.. keep inspiring! You've got this. Xxx
where's your top from? It's sick x
You are so on the money about living authentically online and in person! It’s defoo something even non influencers need to take in
❤❤❤❤❤❤
the way 2020 has come to apply pressure on EVERY aspect of life is crazy but its nice to hear someone speaking positively of working through the struggles
Love and light to you and Mike 💛
All the best with everything😘
I think quarantine has impacted a lot of our lives... at least the people who choose to follow the guidelines. I’m usually the most happiest person but this year has really taken its toll on me. It’s so much happening I’m at the point I just hope and pray me and my whole family make it out of 2020 healthy and safely. We are all worried about our jobs and security. Things are really crazy over here in the US... all we can do is pray.
Love you!!
You got this girl. We fully support you. Sending love and prayers your way. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️
Patricia, I honestly appreciate all of your honesty in this video and being open. It may have been hard for you to share but thank you for doing this and here to support you through it all ❤️❤️
Sending lots and lots of love x
Love you Patricia thank you for being so open! Whatever the devil made out for evil will workout in your favour IJN! You & Mike got this 💕💕 x
I’ve literally mention a day ago that I’ve not been feeling well emotionally and mentally, I’m about to be 5 months postpartum literally had my baby during when quarantine had happen, was so excited to have my baby and it’s crazy that it happen during this time. I haven’t been taking care of myself lately haven’t been eating much and I had to decide to change certain things cause I wAnt to be well and strong for my daughter dont want to have  that sort of energy around her , maybe exercise and try different routine. Remember to take care of yourself , and love yourself. Sorry for this long paragraph but haven’t been able to speak about this to anyone about this but my husband but I’m sharing with Patricia and her followers ❤️
We’re all always so focused on the next thing. The next job, the next holiday, the next home , the next car. You will never be content and find happiness this way. Happiness is right now in the moment where you are. There’s so much to be thankful for health, family , a home 💓 Love you Patricia! Things will get better, focus on the now , how much you’ve achieved to be where you are now 😘 wishing you and your family many blessing and peace x
My surname isn't bright, haha that sent me!
Death and life is in the power of the tough
Love this, thanks Patricia for your transparency. Love you!
👏👏💯 The mind and the body be doing TOO MUCH!!!
Yes to being your authentic self Patricia. I’ve been watching you since waaaaaay back, before you and mike even got engaged - I think we’ve all seen you grow and evolve and just appreciate your honesty here. So many influencers, rightly so, chase the bag but then forget themselves in the process. Thank you for keeping it real. Lots of love! X
I love you Patricia! And God's got you love!
This video was everything I needed, being soft is a sign of strength because you realise all these things you're putting on yourself aren't always yours to carry❤️ thank you Patricia
This just makes me love you more Patricia. Your very authentic and I appreciate that about u.
Sending you so much love darling ❤️❤️❤️
Definitely! 2020 is the year of self reflection & truth being revealed‼️❤️☮️🌍
Thank you, Patricia, for opening up your hear to us! ❤️I know, how it must have been very hard. Especially sharing heartbreaking details about you and Mike. I wish you ALL the love and support to each other! You are an amazing couple and I'm sure you will get through this!
Matthew 11: 28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
Keep working at it if it’s possible to save the relationship then it’s worth it. Get counselling for both of you.
Thank you for this video Patricia...living your truth is actually not easy as others may perceive. I think this video was very well timed. Vulnerability is so empowering.
Well done, your so right, not easy being a woman xx
God>marriage>family>career- everything will fall into place when you get the order right! This year has been scary af for most of us but I’m praying my way through the rest of it because at this point, something has to give!!
Patricia one thing that devil is fighting so hard at is marriage because its a picture of unity with God. Please take these struggles to God, please have Jesus at the centre of your relationship and you and Mike will have the mindset of fighting through the struggles knowing that you guys are not the enemy, the enemy are the things wanting to come between you, so fight, together in Jesus. Praying for you, keep inspiring!
P.s I sent you a little gift to your inbox which might help with the wellness/fitness/goodness journey you're starting xxx
Awww Pat this is truly touching girl. I never knew you've been facing tough times 😢 sorry to hear this. We care and love you. I pray for you sis. Things will get better do not worry. Pat I am also a Christian counselor. So do not hesitate sis we're all here for you. Remember we can't do all by ourselves without Jesus. God bless you Pat ❤
You are amazing! Thank you for being so open and honest... When you mentioned about your relationship, I felt you!  Lockdown almost broken down my relationship too. (Side note. a bob looks so lovely on you!) x
Thank you for being so honest Patricia ❤️❤️ lockdown has been SO HARD for us all - but hearing other people sharing their struggles makes me (and I’m sure plenty others) feel less alone. This took a lot of guts! Looking forward to whatever new content you bring us.
If this is not me right now
Ughhh Patricia you probably won’t even see this but if you do I just want you to know how much of an inspiration you have been for me ever since I was much younger. I’ve been watching you for about 5-6 years and I’m going into my last year of Highschool in one week and it’s crazy to think that I’ve grown seeing your life and your experiences. To me you have always been one of the realest YouTubers. Point blank period. Ofc you tidy up your life for us a lot of the times but I’ve never felt as if you were completely deceiving us when it came to your family, your marriage or even your work. I’ve always looked up to you when I thought about the type of woman I want to become and now that I’m turning 18 in a few months (obviously I’m in no way super grown) I feel like I just wanted to let you know you showed me what I could be if I truly believed in myself and went all in. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ much love Patricia. I can’t wait to keep going on this journey with you☺️
Your surname isn't bright ?! Shook shook shook shook to my core.
patricia its the fucking planets I swear research it all the conjunctions which the last time they did this was hundred years ago or smt like that! I swear been going thru the same 😆
Thank you for opening up and  being real and honest with us!!  You will be ok. ❤❤❤
Thanks for just telling us how you have been. I just had a baby 1 year ago and  struggled with PPA. I am also learning to love my new body again which is not easy! Hope u stay safe. Love from Singapore
The Lord is sending us all a message. We need to understand that it's not about us. Put God First, I am also speaking to myself.
Love and prayers to you and your family. You got this!!❤️
As a Christian Patricia, take some time to recenter your life and thoughts on God.
WE LOVE YOU PATRICIA!!!!
When Patricia spoke about her and Mike, makes me nervous.
You have bought me so many smiles during some tough times, and for that I thank you from the bottom of my ❤️. We are all human no one person is perfect, even though to me you seem perfectly put n gaaawjus 🥰I pray that God covers you and guide you and your family thru, because you are a brave warrior, just for even sharing. You Got this Sweety!!! 🙌🏽😻😘
Hi hon sending some hugs and love your way. I felt it when you said us women help everyone else while we are/get broken and I can definitely relate. That's why I am on a 10 day Daniel's Fast. I have to refocus and recenter my life around Christ.
I do not owe anybody anymore thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Your video saved me, Patricia. I have been going through the exact thing. Happy to know am not alone.
“You are who God says you are. You are made in the image of God, the creator of the heavens and the earth. Because of God’s love for you and I (the human race), He sent His only begotten son Jesus Christ to die on the cross, so that we could have eternal life and not go to hell. Jesus Christ arose from the dead. He is alive and is the only Messiah- the King of Kings, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End. Jesus Christ is the saviour of this world. Accept Jesus as your LORD and Saviour today (Romans 10:9-13). Invite Him into your heart and allow Him to change your life through the Holy Spirit. He forgives you for your sin. Nothing is too big for Him. Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to the Father. Jesus loves YOU so much and He chose to die for YOU.” He is good and YOU are loved. God bless 🙏🏿
If my husband didn't go back to work during covid, I doubt we'd still be together. It got difficult because so much anxiety was in our home, plus children - things got hard emotionally. Great that you're choosing this path, I thought we'd lost you to the internet. This year requires all the authenticity we can get.
Tell Mike he's not going anywhere...God is your strength
💙💙💙💙💙
I think being real and open is what brings people more close to you which serves a greater purpose. Transparency creates connectivity, so thank you for your truth 🤍
https://youtu.be/ghDlyGD8kq0
For once! thought, I was the only one going through a lot lately😢 God help us all...
Been here since BritPopPrincess days🖤
Thanks for sharing Patricia! The thought of you and Mike not being together after following you both for so long.... it breaks me! At the end of the day though of course I know it’s about your happiness and if you guys don’t find each other compatible anymore, that’s life. It’s sad, but I believe one has to do what they feel it’s right for them. I hope you’ll work it out, and I’ll keep you guys in my thoughts! Looking forward to seeing more of you in the future Pat. Love youuuuu (and you look absolutely stunning to me, always have and always will, because your personality and your wisdom are out of this world)
Yes 2020 is testing everything! My husband and I now have been stronger then ever. So I’m love. So I think everyone is experiencing everything in every way.
It takes a lot of guts Patricia but good for you for speaking out ❤️❤️ lots of love to you girl and your family ❤️❤️
Your marriage will not breakdown. We just all need to survive the next 4 months and I believe next year will be better, it has to be 🙏🏾❤️❤️ 2020 has been rough, hang in there...
Am I the only one crying during this video!!! We love and appreciate you Patricia, thank you for sharing so much of your life with us even though you don't have to!
It must be so hard. 🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️
This year has been such a flop. 3 weeks after we got married last year September, my husbands brother was murdered. So we went into marriage with a bang and a struggle. We fought a lot and I actually went to sleep by my mom for a few days to get away. We live in a bachelor flat and have no escape from each other. I definitely don't want to leave my husband, he's amazing, but this intense grief and all that comes with it has been hard on us as a couple and individuals. We're doing much better, but I had to change a lot in how I dealt with things and he had to change as well. 1 week until our first anniversary and we have so much to celebrate together. If you know that you are happy together and it's just current circumstances that are testing you, then I encourage you all to keep trying. If you aren't happy at the core if your relationship then it's time to move on
If you're reading this, you're gonna be successful in life. Just keep pushing. You'll surely get there! Our youtube channels will go viral in 2020!
So amazing seeing such a strong and independent woman admit that she does have her "shit together" i think too many of us put that pressure on ourselves to have it all and sometimes (most of the time) its too much! Thank u for making me feel more normal for not having all my shit together 🙃
I really appreciate you being so honest and open about everything. I can't wait to see you going through the new chapter in your life! You're such an inspirational woman 💗
I love this transparency - Patricia you are GOLD!
The most important thing is for us to be happy and usually we are at our happiest when we are truly authentic. It should always come in this order God, family and work; that is how it was always intended. At the end of the day you are human and it’s okay for you to go through tough times. It has never been about perfection but about improvement in all aspects of our lives. Sending you love and positive vibes. This to shall pass. ❤️😍😍🥰
I feel for you, I suffered with post natal depression after having twin girls it didnt help I had depression already, 4 years later and I still do suffer, its hard but you just got to take time out for yourself and have a minute to breathe😊, do what you can to make you feel better 💕 love you girl were all here for you
Am grateful that am peaceful.... That alone is great to me. The ability to breathe in n out at this point is Everything. Other things are secondary... Breathe one day at a time.
I hope and pray you and Mike are able to get through any tough times in your marriage..the whole time l was watching l was like please please please don't say you are separating
We need "The MIND and the BODY be doing TOO MUCH" on a t-shirt.
❤️
🧡
I would love to come along your diastasis recti journey, as I suffer from it as well and yet to get it fixed. It would be so helpful 🧡🙏
Great Video Patricia your an amazing woman and honestly even though you might not think it you’ve been extremely transparent over the years and it’s helped so many people! Including myself you’ve inspired me so much! Love you sis, would love to see more of your motherhood side! 🤍✨
So brave to speak out. There is so much pressure on social media at the moment, I'm not even a 'big' influencer and I feel it and hate the hate too. I also feel you on the having a baby - my 3rd daughter is 2 and has not yet slept a full night and it's been tough! I hope the change helps you feel better and look forward to the content change!
Post natal depression is real, life is not about the hustle, if life feels short trim the calendar in half. Its ok to be healthy. Its ok to be a mum and spend time cuddling with you husband.
Hi Patricia.Talking and honesty can be very helpful it gives others permission to do the the same.What a time we have all been through. Quarantine has made us all think through alot and we have all been through changes.My relationship was tested purely by being together all of the time.We are back working again and all is well but different.You have a baby too all so much to balance in normal times.I had a conversation with my hairdresser this week who is going through this she has a baby and her husband is working from home..Dont be too hard on yourself just remember things are going to be a little different.Can i also say that the first time i saw you was on your racism video which i thought was amazing. Your links took me to the Stephen Lawrence foundation and i decided to become a friend so thank you for that.Good luck xx
You know what Patricia,  all of that! Everything that you said resonated with me, as I know I need to do the same and step into my authentic self! There are so many fears! Lock down has taught me a lot and continues to teach me things about, myself,  my children and my husband. Boi has it tested the relationship I have with all 3 including myself! I look forward to upcoming videos. Stay true,  stay safe! x
Damn, these streets are hard. I always thought you really got it together. Never knew it was also hard for you.. We got it sis. 💙
When we all said in 2019 that 2020 would be better we really had no idea🙄
Well, even though you said you aren't perfect.. you sure look perfect! You look absolutely stunning in that dress and your make-up,!!  Coming from a long time subscriber, I have always loved your content, but I can't wait to see all of the new changes/content you have planned for your channel!! I'm sending you all of the positive, uplifting, healing energy your way! Xoxoxoxoxo ❤️ You are beautiful!!! 👍🏻👑
You are doing so well you know, you've been through a lot especially in the last 12 months. I just watched your birth and baby allergies videos and that's a lot, then COVID as well. Even this video right now is strength. I hope you two will come out of this closer than before. xx
I know a lot was said ... but the biggest shock her last name isn't Bright 😱!    Look forward to new content sending you and your family prayers and love!
Stay strong Patricia. You are such an inspiration to so many women. Love the honesty. We all have our ups and downs but I think this year is probably the worst year of most people's lives. It can only get better from here ♥️
We love you no matter how you look or feel inside. Just know your beautiful inside and out. You are a blessing.
Appreciate the real talk. People look at influencers thinking you do not have the same life as everyone. We all the same people who feel the same and go through life as a continuous development.
Thanks for being so open. I love the idea of being more authentic. It’s easy to use confidence and happiness as a mask. I struggle sometimes with being the “strong” person. And I’m learning to be ok with just being human and it’s ok to be soft. You’re awesome Patricia!
We love you !!! Keep your head up. Everything will be okay pumpkin!
😘😘😘 🌸🌸🌸 ❤️❤️❤️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 💕💕💕
I feel like Patricia is so successful but the cost of her success is
Wowwwwwww I had 10 centimeters separation with my hernia it was a hard recovery like having a baby. Be careful working out. Bless you 👍🏼
Love you Patricia 🤎
Sending you so much love x
Hey Lydia here 🤚 here since day dot............ You're names not bright????!!!! 😱😱😱😱😱 Sorry to hear you're having a tough time of it but it seems like you're grabbing life by the balls ❤️❤️❤️❤️ you're so pro active and inspirational
Go get it girl ! Sending good thoughts to your family 💙
Patricia is a real one. Appreciate your transparency, and you need to give time to you, it’s simpler and those that stick with you are the real ones too. We absolutely love you and collective support you.
A thought: Please don't take what you're going through in your relationship too seriously because it's not because of the weakness of your relationship, it's simply because of this quarantine life and whole vibe of 2020. Things can get exaggerated and crazy because of a whole mood tone of the year, try to get through it and not worry much, and focus on the love not imperfections. Tell your partner that these things are just illusion, I'm sure if a lot of people would be ok if they just didn't focus on the imperfections and the weak sides and carry on to 2021, they would feel hella different next year and wouldn't have to seperate. When you focus on love and love only, everything magically heals but this year is making you not focus on it so problems arise. Don't let it get to you love.  Also, youtubers that let the negative aspects of their lives spill in their videos usually just like the feeling of doing that more and more and gradually go to a really really dark place in the end. Of course share your reality but be careful girl, darkness and negativity are addicting; be as far away to it as you can and add it as little to aspects of your life as you can. Love you
look after yourself and live your truth 😘
I NEEDED this video. I am also coming out of post natal depression. Took me ages to recognise it too as my son is 17 months old so I was definitely a bit late to the game! Sending you hugs and appreciation for this video. Thank you thank you thank you.❤️❤️
Thanks for sharing. I signed up for life coaching this week. This year has been REAL and it's a new life now we cant go back to the old so facing the truth is necessary.
I love your content so much and I am excited to see where your content goes ❤
Thank you for sharing ❤️💕🙏🏼😘
I've always loved your transparency. Thank you for being honest with us.
Thanks for being You !! I  always enjoy your content and I'm sure you gonna be even better,Keep being You ❤️❤️❤️
Loved this!!!! The honesty. You have let what burdened you out and I’m confident that you will find your way back to yourself. On fear, I recently got out of my fear of making content that is authentically me, and ever since I made the bold choice to do it anyways, I’ve felt free. Looking forward to building my tribe because I’m no more shrinking to fit anyone’s mould. I’m confident you will do the same, Patricia. And I’m sorry about your hernia and the discomfort. I pray the next season ushers in more peace for you and your family. ❤️
Girl I understand where you’re coming from but just keep your personal relationship private you don’t need to show us everything, your channel is already perfect.
It is crazy that the most beautiful people (inside and outside) are dealing with so much insecurities. This goes out to EVERYONE who feels that way: You are FABULOUS! 🌞
❤️❤️ I personally didn’t find you to be inauthentic, that would’ve just reflected in your videos which wasn’t the case. We’ve now been into the internet era for two decades and I think that it’s everyone’s own responsibility to be a conscious user. If someone still thinks that being a bubbly and positive person online makes you perfect, then that’s on them. Although I must admit that a little reminder doesn’t hurt, but then again you have done that sufficiently throughout your carreer. ❤️ Will keep supporting you! Hope you don’t feel like you haven’t been enough for us, you have put a smile on my face every time you upload for one and I think on others too 😉 You are almost at 3M subscribers, that must mean something. Bless you Patricia 🥰
Thank you for being so real and vulnerable Patricia! I have been watching you for years and years and I absolutely adore and support you. You are genuine and relatable and I look forward to your future content! Stay healthy and bright and be comfortable in life’s ups and downs
Thanks for being honest with us love you doll
Do what you need to do girl, get through how you need to and do it unapologetically!!!! This year has definitely been an eye opener and emotionally draining.
Get yourself well and whole. We support you through this next chapter; being authentic is always when you feel best
Stay strong queen ....it's been hard but we move ....at our own pace ofcourse
I love you sweet woman ❤
I don't care what you share. Just keep it together. You don't owe the world any explanation into your personal.life because YouTube is a business. Take a break and focus on your healing and cultivating a good core environment for your family because when you're not filming, you have to face your family. Make sure you choose peace above all. We will alright. Be mom/wife and rock that shit! Love you Gul! ❤️
Choosing Bright = perfection. These ARE hard times, my hubby is my best friend and puts up with my crazy ups and downs. Your confessions make me love you more, but I don’t feel like you owe me ANYTHING you don’t want to share. You are so bubbly and just such a joy...EVEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU’RE BEING A DOWNER, that you could read the weather report and I would tune in.
💙💙💙 Pat- wishing love and support during your recovery. Your openess about discussing this is so important for those who have gone through it, are going through it, may go through it in the future, or are supporting someone who is going through it. Sending you positive energy. I've always subscribed to you- wherever you are at the time. Bless up.
Wishing you and Mike the very best. Stay strong together. Sending you both all the positive energy💛
Thank you for that Patricia ❤️🙏🏽
You are not alone love. Stay strong and keep GOD first. You will be just fine. We love you 😘
Hi Patricia! Thanks for being so transparent. That was very brave of you. I respect you not sharing your family and I don't feel like you have to because it's fine to have privacy and boundaries. Especially with kids involved, because ppl can be awful online. I am excited for this next chapter though whatever it looks like! 🖤🖤
Love you Patricia! Been here since the beginning and I missed this open side of you. Thanks for being you and sharing yourself with us. As great as it is, they really don't tell us all that comes with being a woman!
Was I the only one shook that her last name isn’t actually Bright???
Sending you all the love and strength your way, Patricia! love you so so much!! take care xoxo
Sending all the positive energy for you and your family❤
Sending you love!! I really do feel like conversations like these are important to have, whether it’s just with friends or in a video like this ❤️❤️❤️
So so good! It´s normal to protect yourself in certain areas and especially online. I´ve experienced it myself although my socical media is small. It´s really noticable that changes are happening within you and I find it brave that you share it! Keep up Omalicha (inside and outside)! We love you! Warm hugs from Vienna/Austria, Ela
So excited for your honest and open content!!
I was supposed to get married this past April, but do to Covid we canceled. I left my fiancé in May for good after 8 years
Beautifully strong Patricia! 2020 has given many people the opportunity to listen to their mind and body in a way that we've never had the chans to before, and for many it has been tough. You staying true to that and sharing this with us will, I am sure, not only help yourself but countless others who feel just like or similar to you.  Keep doing you, remember that showing vulnerability, showing care and joy, but also sharing the difficult and hard times, allowing people into your life like this - that is truly strong. You're amazing! Stay safe out there/inside. 💚✨
And transgender women will never understand what it means to be a woman. It’s not about physical appearance, it’s the hormones and internal feelings and the period and pregnancy and all this God given gift that make us women
PPD and marriage issues has me feel like I’m going crazy honestly this is too much
Thank you so much Patricia for making this video we watchers constantly think that everything is as good as it looks on an Instagram picture. We know is not but how can we believe it if all the stories and pictures are perfect. Thank you so much for the reminder, coming from it means a lot! What saved my fiance and I during quarantine was actually not living together otherwise I don't think I was going to be able to continue our relationship wich actually makes me super sad because that only makes me question myself if he's the one for me or if we'll be able to handle each other.
I agree. This has all changed us. I used to be so productive and extremely motivated. Now I’m more like eh. I have no motivation. It’s killing me and I’m trying everyday just at a slower pace. And I’m learning to be okay that I’m going at a slower pace.  What matters is that I’m still going.
I Love you Patricia, since the britpopprincess days til the end of time. I'm 26 now and I've been following you for so long, I've witnessed parts of your journey in life. You inspire me so much. I feel like you've always been one of the big sisters to me that I wish I had. Thank you for sharing and being so personal, and I accept you for who YOU want to be here on YouTube. Blessings to you and your family!
Thanks for sharing. Do what’s right for you.
broke up in 2020 but i feel im finally getting over it ^-^ things get better when you work on yourself
Thank God your daughter is doing much better
As a long time subbie, I just want to give you a hug. Girl, we love you. Make the rest of 2020 your beatch.
Sending Virtual hug. ❤️
I usually don’t like commenting on videos but this is your most #relatable video yet! 2020 has been straight trash
Patricia, going to support you in a new journey. Sending you a tons of good energy! 🌸✨
This was so uplifting Patricia. I appreciate you bringing this forward and I’m praying it will help many many many people. We love you and I too hope for a better 2020.
This is why I love you. You are so honest and raw with us. You don’t put on a show for us and act like everything is perfect when it’s not. You are human just like us. This year has been a lot. It’s very overwhelming. This year was such a rude awakening that I’m speechless and I’m not sure what to expect next. It’s kind of like expecting the worst but praying for the best. I pray things get better in your life and in the world as well. Love you Queen. ❤️
I love you girl and I wish you nothing but the BEST ... so I hear a lot of people say their relationship almost broke during quarantine but noone says why or how. Is it to much time together, did you learn you're not as compatible as you thought, are you able to ignore your issues when you can fill your day with outside issues? Please elaborate. Not being nosey, just need the warning signs. GOD BLESS YOUR FAMILY!!! 🥰
I legit thought your surname was Bright 😅
This too shall pass. It won't last. Grab hold to Jesus Christ and his Word like never before and hold on through this storm. Amen.
Appreciate your openness in this video, and I’m here for the new chapter 💕 you got this Mrs Patricia!! I’m praying for you, your relationship, your daughters, and your wellbeing! LETS GET IT 2020!!!!
Be and embrace being you.
who tf disliked this video im coming for you
Thanks for opening up to us Patricia. It shows that you’re human and go through problems in Life like any other human being.🙏🏾
Dear Patricia.  This will make you and Mike stronger. A big hug for you all
I commend you for putting your personal business out bc you really didn't have to..but it helps to remind ppl that youtube "celebs" are real ppl with real life issues and struggles like everybody else, despite the pretty perfect picture that is always portrayed...I pray for you getting back to you and for strength and love for your family
I love you babe! Thank you for facing your fears and telling us! :)
Love you too Pat. ❤❤❤
My first comment ever to thyself always be true we love you for who you are fan for life praying you and family
This was so powerful....I'm proud of you!!
All I heard was 🗣 I’M HUMAN!! Love you, Patricia 🥰
It's very healthy for you to be more yourself even if it's because of tough times. Good for you and humanity. I am honestly over not showing how hard life is.
Omg girl I feel u😭😭 I had my second son 4 years ago and still battling diastatisrecti 😣😣 I had hernia repair last year and it wasn’t too bad at all. I wish u all the best girl
I had a baby and I did a tummy tuck for MEEEEE…it was the best decision I have ever made
💖🍭💕
Change is good. You have grown. We are not constant beings…we flow through life and so we have to be ready for what will come
🥰🥰🥰🥰all the love to you.
I think it was obvious to everyone that you don't like or feel happy in your body.
Thank you for being so transparent Patricia. We are all struggling, and it actually makes us feel normal now to have a public figure like you to identify with, I appreciate you.
"My surname isn't bright" :D LOL ur too amusing Patricia. Hands down to you. You have no idea how much of a help and inspiration you have been to me. So carry on and will support =)
Thank you for sharing. Praying for you and Mike. ❤️
Be more prayerful sis and take time out of here if you need it. Relationships and mental health before any thing else.... family always stays forever, other things fade. God bless xxx
You are an amazing young lady. Stop being so hard on yourself. Get you someone, family member, if you can to help you manage the children and a few house details so you can breath.  Men don't get our struggles. But please don't bash yourself and be so hard. Your light shines (Bright). We want you to be yourself but all your business is not for everyone. Try therapy this will allow you to speak freely. Most everyone in the comments agree we want you to still win but not at the cost of all your privacy.  We want to continue to know you as Patricia Bright. In my Naomi Campbell's voice, "You are fabulous darling".😍
I can totally relate to what you said about being strong, this pandemic made me realize that although I was strong on the outside and "got it together", I was actually emotionally weak and too scared to be vulnerable with the people in my life. Now I really make an effort to check in with people and honestly say how I'm feeling rather than act like everything is ok. Being vulnerable gives you the opportunity to connect with other people and share your troubles, and honestly, I've realized that we're really all struggling right now and that its important we communicate and share our feelings with our loved ones.  Sending much love, can't wait to see future videos, xox.
We LOVE you Patricia ❤️❤️❤️❤️!!!!!!
I have been watching you for years and I just love your transparency. Please continue fighting for ur marriage and remember you are beautiful just the way you are. I hope u see this ❤️
Appreciate your openness Patricia 💕💕
This video meant so much to me, and I know to so many other people out there. I am so proud of you! I also have just felt in a slump as of late: so many Black people are dying, COVID, everything, and it's hard to get out of that mindset. It's nice to know someone we look up too isn't perfect either and actively trying to improve her life too. Love you!
Thank you for continuing to be real, honest, and truly you.
This year has been something. Thank you for being vulnerable I will continue to support I love your channel. Best wishes.
You are phenomenal and you are loved!
💚
I understand ! I had my baby this year too and PPD has def taken a toll on me as well, & w the pandemic it doesnt help !
I could say so many things, but all I have is WE LOVE YOU PAT, seriously. Praying for ya in every way! <3
I think Patricia shows so much strength by talking about her struggles. It’s a scary world out there and putting out truths of how difficult things have been in the hope that she can reach her followers and not make them feel alone. This is such a genuine and heart felt video she has put together. None of us know anyone who has it all together and social media definitely only shows the highs so to have someone speak about some lows is something we can all relate too. So thank you. Let’s continue to support one an other. As they say-here’s to strong women; may we know them, may we raise them, may we be them❤️ and being strong doesn’t mean we don’t have weaknesses or times of vulnerability. It really takes someone to be going thru it and be honest that the world isn’t sunshine and roses always. So thank you x
True strength is in vulnerability, not powering through and trying to look like you’re doing ok. This is strength
“Loyal amazing followers and supporters” how sweet: we appreciate you so much too Patrica. God bless you! ❤️
You took the words right out of my mouth <3
Where is the dress from Pat?
You’re so fucking gorgeous, Patricia. I really hope that you can see that while you’re on this journey.
I thought your last name wasn't Bright! I remember years ago you had mentioned it on an early video, but thought I had made that up since I never found that video again and everyone seemed to assume it was. Glad to know I wasn't going crazy haha
It’s like you are getting younger than Oder beautiful hope you family is doing well
Good for you. You’ll never regret prioritizing your mental and physical health.
I've watched your vlogs since I was in high school and you've always been such an inspiration to me. So much so that I started a channel last year! I am constantly in awe of you and feel like I've grown with you on your YouTube journey and in life. Thank you for sharing your life with us. Be good to yourself, be patient with yourself, we will always support you! <3
The Lord just wanted me to encourage you to get in deep prayer over your marriage. Get in your prayer closet (whatevee that looks like for you) and fight in the spirit realm, because things happen in the spirit realm first before the physical. Don't let the enemy break apart what God has joined together. Get on your knees and rebuke him, fasting and continual prayer cause only God can mend things when we allow him. Allow God back in! I pray you two find your happiness again cause the victory has already been won, just claim it and call it back to you! ❤ God bless y'all forever!
Been watching since you were making videos in the bathroom while you were in Uni. So wonderful to see how much you & Mike have achieved. God bless you & your family. Your financial advice has really helped me change my life. At the end of the day you are human …You have to take care of you or you can’t be there for your family.❤️
I don’t usually comment but I love this honesty 💕
Hi Patricia
I loved this! In glad you took the time and was brave enough to share your real and intimate moments with us! Rooting for you and your family❤❤
Patricia, I wish you much happiness. I too struggled in my marriage, we decided to seperate. At first I felt like a failure, but we both realized we just needed time to heal on are own. We got back together with a new perspective. Time apart is healthy and I recommend it, if you are willing to self-reflect.
“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.” ‭‭John‬ ‭14:27‬ ‭NIV‬‬
What a hard year for me too. I totally know how it feels to take care of everyone and not yourself. Not sharing my personal problems hurts a lot. Hopefully my relationship makes it through this difficult year
Your makeup looks so beautiful!! 2020 is hard for everyone.
I feel in love with your channel because of your honesty and your contagious personality....love from Quebec City, Canada...xoxo
Love you!
See how many people genuinely LOVE you? Cherish each encouraging word.. For anybody who says something negative or critical, they're really not your audience anyway. We love and support you. We love your witty sense of humor, your beautiful accent, and your vulnerabilities. Thanks for trusting us.
I wish you and your family well on your endeavors! Remember you've also inspired us along the way...you've helped others you'll never meet and i have always known that meant sacrificing a piece of yourself. We are grateful and rocking with you...OG viewer.
PATRICIA! First, thank you for being you. Second, I completely empathize with what you are experiencing. While I am not in a relationship this quarantine has been one of if not the most difficult thing I have had to deal with mentally. Third, I know you are unhappy with your body, but I want to say that you are truly beautiful. Keep being great!
2020 is tough. It has exposed not only the world but the things we've been running away from personally. One advice I give is therapy and prayer. I'm looking for a therapist here too https://www.baatn.org.uk/find-a-therapist/   Love you and praying for you!!! 🖤🖤🖤🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
I've had an abdominoplasty and it was not what it was supposed to be. I was supposed to have a upper back lift and they didn't do it but charged me. I feel like I should have just stayed heavy. Thanks for sharing. We do go through changes and it is an emotional rollercoaster especially as we get older. I think you look absolutely gorgeous but I understand that what you see and others see has different perspectives on us. ❤❤ Do what you must to make YOU feel good
Love you Patricia! ❤️
I appreciate you and your honesty. My prays and love to you and your husband. Love and time conquers all-remember why you feel in love and it will help you stay in love with the help from Jesus Christ.
Its ok to share when you want to share and not share when you dont want to. We just enjoy you being you and whether thats talking about finances, fashion or personal life. As long as your being u Im still watching. I appreciate the openness cuz alot of us are feeling tested this year and its ok to say I GOT THIS but its very human to say ALL HELL NAWW! LOL...THIS IS TOO MUCH! I NEED TO REGROUP!
Patricia, thank you so much for this.
I rebuke failed marriage from you and mikes life in Jesus name.
You go your way, we’ll go your way too 🥰... looking forward on seeing all your new adventures...love from Canada
I suffered with post natal depression this year with a new born too, broke up with my ex and have had to raise my son on my own,  seeing a women I’ve looked up to for so long go through similar things as me makes me feel I’m not alone ❤️ all the best xxx
Patricia, we completely feel you! All women understand sis!
I'm sure you felt lighter after this girl we all feel you I'm turning 40 in November and I just realized that I need to take care of myself and not only my husband and children I'm here with you wish i could get a tummy tuck myself i would camp outside of the hospital the night before 🤣🤣😜😘😘
I pray it never breaks ❤️
The devil is a liar! Not Aunty Pat and Uncle Mike I rebuke it🙆🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️ Stay praying for you and your family🥺❤️
Patricia I lovee youu!! Girl!! You are doing so great! I love the transparency. Just say it as it is! Dont be discouraged! God is in control! You Got this!
And this is why I appreciate you because you’re such a genuine person 💓🥰
Thank you so much for being so transparent with us! I run a bookclub, BooksForAngst (FB IG ), where we talk about mental health and this month we are talking about postpartum depression and anxiety. I’m so proud of you and your journey. Please keep seeking the professional help that you and your mental health require. YouTube will be here and we will be here whenever you are ready ❤️💕
Forgive yourself - you are enough
I’ve been following you for at least 7 years and you have come a long way! You are amazing 👍🏻💕

💛💛You got this 💪🏽
Thank you for the video Patricia!  Sending love to you and your family and your relationship with your husband. ❣️ I think you always look pretty.
Me and my partner broke up last month, the lockdown really pushed us apart. I can possibly see it as a blessing but this year has sucked big time. 2020 has tested us all. God bring us some light in 2021
thank you for being so vulnerable with us, I hope you and your family continue to feel better and continue growing in the near future!! <3 <3 we love u!!
Hey everyone, hey Patricia!  Let me just start by saying that I FEEL YOUUUUUUUUUU Life ain't easy, life in the UK especially is not easy. Listen, we all go through problems in life but it's all about HOW WE DEAL WITH THEM!  If you want, I know some close friends of mine that can help you with mental and relationship problems..for free! Even if is just to talk.. if you want DM me on insta ( gloriaudz )  Please look after yourselves!! ❤
You don’t need to pretend but don’t feel unnecessary pressure girl......we love you ♥️
So proud of you Patricia. That took a lot of courage to be so open and vulnerable with us. I’ve been watching you since you and Mike were just dating and you’ve come a long way! Love you girl. ❤️
You’re brave, girl. Strength isn’t the only thing you carry. Feel those other emotions and don’t wreck yourself for it.
A recent poem I came across.  It’s translated so maybe not as deep meaning as in original. “A heart for sale...  worth?  A few sweet words”
The raw honesty of this video is awesome! Thank you for being vulnerable with us, being on the internet can be difficult and its nice to know you aren't alone.
Thanks for sharing. You got this girl! We got this. We’re all in it together. Let’s live our best life now 😎👋🥰
🙏🏼
We really appreciate you and wanna connect with you on that level please be yourself
🥰🥰🥰🥰
yes, theres been SO MANY breakups during quarantine !!!!!
Patricia my advice to you is PRAYER. You are going through a lot right now but I truly believe that getting closer to God will help you through these things and gain a lot more clarity/ wisdom. Stay positive and stay faithful. 💗
your videos bring everyone so much joy, it’s so sad to hear you’ve been having a difficult time. wishing you a better end to the year and i hope you receive all the happiness that you put out into the world tenfold  💖💖
Patricia this was absolutely beautiful. Sending all the love your way.
I can only imagine wat ur going thru. It’s okay to cry, leave, smile and everything in between
PATRICIA , we LOVE YOU for who you ARE. Period!
Older folks say “Keep living”.   You will look back on today and say I really looked great what was I talking about.  I know you don’t see it now but don’t be so hard on yourself.
We love you Patricia! Be your true self and give us the content youve been wanting to put out. I love your channel The Break and would love to see all the other things you have to offer
Sending you love and peace. Praying for this next chapter, your relationship and family ❤️
Patricia, you are literally so amazing and so inspirational! Been following your journey for so long now and feel like you’re one of my friends. As women, we are multi faceted beings, and I’m here for all of you! 💕 You keep me laughing, and keep me wanting to do better. Love you girl ✨
Patricia thanks so much for sharing your heart. Your vulnerability really speaks to me as a mom, wife and as a woman. Stay encouraged and I will be praying for you, your family and your journey.
Pat we love you. Please don't make that crusty hand comment ever again. They're not crusty they're real and I had seen absolutely nothing wrong with them.
"They don't tell you that being a woman is like this" Bruh  I feel that My body has just decided to exit the chat And I'm just sitting here like " well imma be alive till 100... so we gotta work something out" All my love to you Patricia 💜 hope everything starts to move on an upward trajectory soon xx
Thank you for sharing! You and your husband look like a strong and happy couple and I really hope you find way out of this crazy times together.  Sending you lots of love ❤
I'm so glad I'm finally coming back to YouTube and I have time to binge watch my faves again. Thank you for being so transparent. Personally, I look up to you and I'm so happy for all your successes. Praying that you have a safe procedure and fast recovery. 🌷🌷🌷
thank you so much for being honest about your vulnerability. it is truly appreciated and great you are able to express your worries. you are an amazing human that deserves to be vulnerable. keep being you and no matter what the true fans will support you forever
Would love to say something wise but I’m only wise when talking to myself.  I appreciate your openness and toughness.  You will get there but there may change. Psalms 26;10
Well done Patricia, we love you!
Sometimes when you are an entertaining happy person it can be a trap in itself, it just segments you into this happy, funny role that people expect you to always play. People act all weird when you are having your bad days expecting you to be all perfect and flawless. Being your true self is freedom.
I like the treu authentic you. Also you should share what makes you happy and what inspires you.  Because that is what makes you’re content Fun   Different, Interesting, Educational and many more things. I also admired you’re honesty ❤️  Ps: Patricia i wish you and you’re husband the best❤️
Being a woman is a journey and a half ! Thank you for being open about the highs and lows of what's been going on ❤ may the last months of 2020 be kinder to all of us
Good point sis! You look back and realize ‘ ummm, why was I tripping about my body” I looked good. We MUST love ourselves in the moment
You GO GIRL! You are such a strong woman!!
This year has been disgusting!! From the start till now I’m just feeling broken and lost. Today is the first day that I didn’t cry and I celebrated that and thanked God! I’m one of those people whose relationship ended and I can’t even say it was quarantine but I’ll say that it all came out then. I’m honestly just done and I’m over it. It’s been 4 months now and I need to pick myself up and go. I can’t pretend I’m okay but things have to start moving.
This too shall pass. Thank you for your bravery, your courage, and your transparency. 2020 has definitely been a tough year for all. I have yet to meet anyone who has not been affected in some way. Praying for you. ~JT
★to the person reading this I just want to remind you that you are loved and appreciate, and you are worthy of greatness ★   𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗧𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 💕
God bless you and your beautiful family ❤️❤️💫
Girl 2020 has bees a year. Let’s be gentle with ourselves.
We're with you Patricia! Be you & do whatever you need to do with the next chapter of your content. I feel you. Most of us have body image issues....especially those of us who've had babies. We get it, girl!
2020 has been hard for a lot of us , you got this !! I’ll be here following your new journey 😉😘
I’m here for you girl 🌹been here for a long time and will continue to support your in your journey of being an incredible woman I learn so much from ❤️
I looked at this earlier today and I was speechless I felt like I should say something but I did not know what to say.  So I came back this evening to say Thank you!  Thank you for saying all of things that we as women want to say but for whatever reason we do not.  God is still on the throne-He Reigns and none of the things that have happened or will happen in 2020 have taken Him by surprise. "Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before" Phil 3:13. Moving forward!
You are so loved. You are so empowering. Keep the faith xx
Love you Patricia!! Thank you for opening up and sharing all of this with us.
As amazing as our minds and bodies are, Nature is unfair to women. Thank you for sharing. You have helped a lot of people with this video, I assure you.
Patricia! I've been watching you since 2011. I am a Naija girl living in the U.S. I remember watching you while I was in college in 2008 and wanting to do youtube, but I was too afraid. I didn't like that comments section. I saw when you went natural and I didn't like some of the comments and it just freaked me out from being a youtuber because I could sense that you have to have tough skin. I just wanted to say you are awesome for showing us all that you have shown. I feel like I grew up with an older sister that I always wanted (I believe you are 3 years older than I). Today is my birthday and I have been feeling so depressed from losing my job due to covid and on unemployment. I hope one day if I survive this crazy life I will get to meet you one day you are truly an inspiration. <3
We love and appreciate you too Patricia. I love this real you. 2020 has been shit but it HAS to get better. Just write the year off like everyone else and take the rest of the year to get well physically and mentally. Life is too short. Just go find your happiness again. We have all got your back girl and your family will hold you down. Sending you virtual hugs 💕💋
Sending positive energy and a warm hug.
You are so refreshingly genuine and beautiful inside and out Patricia. You deserve the whole world! Thankyou for being your authentic self! Sending peace and blessings to you and the fam from Australia x may you start to feel more like the Patricia you want to be soon ❤️
Hi Iim sorry to hear about your complications . I have one question thoe y did u lie about your last name I don't understand??!!!😩😩😩😡😡
The realest ... love you for that 🙌 look after urself and family xx
2020 will end on a high for us all. Amen
Sometimes the worst part about depression is not even realising that you were experiencing until you are out of it or close to getting out of it and you reflect on your last months or years snd realise that you've been going on auto-pilot. Love you Pat 🖤 God bless and watch over you and your family.
I don’t know what it is but when I watch you I feel like I know you lol you’re so real you make me laugh and just thank you
Hi Pat, I've been following you for a long time! I am going to be keeping you in my thoughts/prayers for your relationship! Quarantine has been tooooough. I just want to say that it's perfectly fine to be protective of your space and privacy.   Also I do remember when you chose the name Bright 😂. You said it is because you like how happy and bright the name was. But so many people in the influencer and entertainment industry that use stage names (quick example -- Cardi B whose name is Belcalis).
I’m so sorry to hear about everything. I really hope everything works out, you’ll be in my prayers. I know what body image issues are like for sure, but I want you to know that I think you are soo beautiful! You got this girl ❤️
PATRICIA I DO NOT KNOW YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU BETTER TREAT MICHAEL BETTER BECAUSR HE IS A REALLY GOOD HUSBAND AND FATHER I AM 10000%  SURE.. I AM
I think those of us that have followed your life/career story since you started are aware of many of the changes.  I started watching because I enjoyed seeing how life might work in another country and I enjoyed seeing your family of origin specially Maureen!  I enjoyed the early seasonal look books(far more than hauls actually!), the weekend road trips-Pat fast asleep while Mike was driving.  I enjoyed glimpses of trips abroad.  But I really really miss the trips to NANDOS!!! lol Do you Pat and we'll go along for the ride!  Peace!
This spoke SO much to me. I was struggling with mental health before the quarantine and these past few months have really broke me. I’m so lost/confused right now. Don’t know what to do with my life, seriously. But hearing you talk about struggle and getting through it is a breath of fresh air. I have admired you so much throughout the years watching you and even more now.
Thank you for sharing, it was very refreshing and I know that probably took a lot for you to do this. You have the support of your subs and some of us (me), have been and are in similar situation to you. Stay strong, 2020 will not break us! Xx
Hi Patricia thanks for sharing! I was just wondering how your little baby's skin is doing lately? I hope she's doing much better and sending you much strength in a difficult time.
I needed this video Patricia I’m with you girl. Love you and your family and videos. You will get through this and things will get better. Positivity being sent your way. ❤️
We’re routing for you. For some of us who’ve never had that love/life partnership, it means so much to see you and Mike happy together. I always like when you shout out your husband for putting in the work for you, and supporting your ventures. Keep working at it, the best way you want to, and know how 🙅🏿‍♀️
I love you so much Patricia since I’ve been 15 and I’m now 21. And I look forward to embracing this new chapter in your life and getting to know you again in a different light. Hope you feel our love and support. We appreciate your honesty, beauty, laughter and love. Thank you for this. Wish you well, and pray for God to  listen to your heart and prayers 🙏🏾
It’s not just Covid! People don’t talk about how hard a new baby is on a woman! Everything changes & we aren’t able to complain about the lack of sleep, the constant crying, the body changes, working around the clock, no free time & we’re supposed to do it all with a smile!! Exhausting..
So u have everything and u still not happy. Maybe u should try be thankful for once. Doesn't look like u thankful for your kids seeing that u said they're anoiyng (why have them then) ,for your health for your husband, for your house, the businesses that u have etc, no wonder u have problems. It s hard to be next to someone that no matter what they have and how much they achieve they are never happy. U should be thankful everyday for everything, appreciate it ,some people don't have half of what u have and they put double the work or more. Tired of big YouTubers complaining about stupid things instead of being thankful. Get a reality check
Patricia, thankyou so much for opening up about everything you have gone through. I can't imagine what it's like for you to go through so much and conduct yourself as who we all see on the internet. Sometimes you have to be vulnerable and take a break. Take care of yourself and know that how you feel right now is valid. Take your time and I can't wait to see what you have in store for us <3
Thank you for your transparency Patricia - this helps a lot of us, women, mummies, wives... May God continue to give us the strength to go through these challenges 🙏🏽
absolutely loved this video ! you are stronger than you think , this was quite inspiring acc ... thank you
You look great Patricia! You are a role model for me . Don’t ever diss yourself like that, hurt my feelings.
OMG! When I say I have been going through some of the same issues!. 2020 has really taught me how strong I am and that being a woman is no easy job. I have laughed ,cried, prayed, and shouted all within the last half hour for absolutely no reason.  All I know is that I am going to get through this year and whatever is going on with my body and mental state. I refuse to lose this battle. Hang in there Patricia, we got this girl!👍🏾😊
Yes this has been crazy for everyone. Thanks for sharing your life, and being honest. Much success on mending your relationship just take it one day at a time because tomorrow is not promised. Stay bless happy Sunday.
9:26😂 I had no ideaa that wasn't your name
We just have to keep fighting and never be embarrassed to talk about stuff that we are going through.god bless you and family and may the bond between you and your husband grow even stronger.🙏
Proud of you and we are here for you! Thanks for opening up to us ❤️ It’s been a hard personal journey at the moment but we got to just push through and remind ourselves who we are! Patricia you are GOLD!! Don’t forget it x
Thank you for you transparency! This is what all influencers should strive for. This is how you stand above the rest. 🥂 On another note, body dysmorphia almost killed me. I got breast implants and they slowly poisoned my system. I also thought I had ab separation..I kid you not after my explant my stomach is flat. Those dang implants made my body go haywire!..The weirdest symptoms. I was extremely moody and depressed. I asked my husband for a divorce so many times in our first year. It was crazy because I’m a pretty chill person naturally. I explanted Sept 2019. I feel like myself again. Please, please look into breast implant illness. You will be amazed at other women symptoms. I do hope and pray you get to loving your body like the temple God created it to be. ❤️❤️
sending all the positive vibes your way Patricia
Girl, I wish we were like real friends in "real life" where we could be accountability partners. We are going through so many similar things that we are trying to improve while making money moves! Anyways, like you said, life is too short so we just need to keep living in the present. Sending love to everyone out there x
Thank you so much for this. I look at your videos and your Instagram and I always picture you as a normal woman of course, but with way less problems than the rest of us... I'm sorry for what you are going through, but speaking about it brings us a relieve. Yes, this amazing woman that I follow is going through quarantine, relationship issues, body image issues... Exactly as I am! And we both are still very strong and amazing! Thanks, Patricia!
Realiest video you ever made. ❤ Love from Canada.
Everything is going to work out for your higher good and the higher good of your family! Thank you for sharing. The gift of this pandemic is that it’s forcing us all to do our work. It’s rough but we’ve got this!
Fellow always smiling, strong woman here. I appreciate you being vulnerable and making this video! There is strength in being your full authentic self, both smiles & tears.
Sending you hugs and love, thank you for your transparency.
Love you and we're here for you. Thanks for being so real babe ❤❤❤
Praying for you and Mike! <3 and hope your surgery goes well!
Patricia , I realize you don't realize this About yourself, but you look great now! Please don't sell yourself short, but I know you have to be Content with you! Do what makes you happy , do what makes you feel happy , do you!
Thank you for sharing your struggles, Patricia.  This was hard for you,  but we really appreciate this. 2020 has been a rough one.. but you will come through 💜💜💙🧡💛💚🤍
Big hugs! It's a struggle of a year!
Sending prayers your way🙏🏽. Life happens and you have the right attitude to deal with it!  2020 certainly has been quite the ride.  I know we’ll all be ok, so you just take care.  Best wishes!
Loooove this cant wait you’re so brave
Wow this video hit me. I think i am been in the same position as her hiding my feelings.  and even feeling mentally ill. Having  crazy thoughts only for myself
I really respect you 👏🏾😊💫💕🤗 sending lots of love and light to you and everyone who has been through a difficult time
You are sooooo beautiful!   <3
Thanks for sharing. We can never be always happy...showing different emotions is healthy for all of us. If you do not feel comfortable with sharing, I respect and understand. Be confident, be positive, and be kind to yourself and ourselves too!
We love you Patricia!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for sharing
We love and believe in you 💕💕💕
I think 2020 has caused everything to think deep about who they are, what they want to do and the legacy they want to leave. Life is truly short and tomorrow is not promised Atall.
Hie Patricia  To be honest, a few months ago, l have a God given gift of being a dreamer and l did have a dream of you and Mike announcing out like you guys were having a divorce or something like that. It truly disturbed me and l prayed about it but hearing about what you shared about your relationship reminded me to tell you and now l am also able to share with you. Hopeful you can see this comment.  Nevertheless, still praying for you sis. God bless you and be with you through all of this.  LETS ALL PRAY FOR PATRICIA GUYS AND ALSO FOR EACH OTHER even in the comments ♥️
Jesus Christ is the Way the Truth and the Life.🙏
Your body doesn’t look Awful 🙃....... You are perfect
I appreciate your honesty! 2020 has been a roller coaster and everyone has had to deal with a lot of uncertainties
Sending love ❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for sharing, you are such an inspiration 😍
You've got this pat..this year has really been a journey and i completely get it.youve literally been so inspiring to me for years and your talks really do resonate with me.God bless you and your family and keep you safe 🙏😘
2020 right! Looking forward to the new content ☺️. Love your work 🤗
Love this Patricia 💛💛💛
That Bob is LIFE on you Patricia!
You are almost at 3 million subscribers 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Love this Kai Dress on you plus this Bob is 🔥🔥
We love you Patricia!!
I will give you a new heartand put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stoneand give you a heart of flesh. Ezekiel 36.26
I can totally agree with what you have mentioned in terms of mental health, body image and relationships. I have been doing a lot of self love... 💕
I feel so honored that you are telling us all of this,  thank you for being so honest to us. ❤️ I pray that your relationship will get better with Mike I love you guys so much
Sending lots of love and support hun!! we are all in some sort of transition in our lives 💯 with all the revelations that the world has experience in the pass few months we are bond to also see and experience in our own lives. God Bless you and your family hun🙏🏾
This video is everything to me. I couldve said everything youve said you literally just retold my life. Relationship issues, family issues, two babies, diastisis recti (5cm gap) THREE abdominal hernias, post natal depression after my 2nd son, going back to work leaving my kids, trying to keep it all together, GIRL it is hard and there aint no manual to get us through this maze called life. But sharing your story helps yourself and others in the same postition and im grateful. You have always been relatable to me and now i just feel you even more. All blessings to you, we’ll get there in the end 🙏🏾❤️
Love you Patricia!! Sending lots of prayers and love your way 💞
I pray God give you and Mike the strength you need to grow and build your family ♥️

Can we just pause and take in Pats beauty and top? Like your so comforting too look at🥺❤️✨also appreciate the transparency, I related so much to you❤️
This year has been an awful year, as difficult as it is to say but it has been something we need to put behind us, just like you said life is damn too short and we are just passers- by, so do more of what makes you happy and care less of peoples judgements.
Oh you look awesome, but I understand, working on internet we want to look on point all the time.. And sometimes life happens indeed, but enjoy the process, think that at least you are trying, and you don't give up! That's great! That's why u r successful, bc u keep trying, and I want u to keep trying! Bc u did so much hard work, and u deserve much more! Anyway, good luck for your next chapters.
The things that suck won’t last forever. It shall pass. I pray you and Michael won’t give up and that you’ll both come out better together. Remember Jesus, He cares❤️
Same here my body has always been an insecurity. I planned on growing this year as well, so hopefully watching you journey can help me.
Patricia your a beautiful woman. I knw you hve to come to conclusion about your self and you will. Take your time with it and whatever makes you happy then you do it with no regrets. Beautiful queen.
Some of the couples stories I've heard about quarantine have been hilarious. One of the ladies I follow said quarantine made her realize that marriage isn't for her. Someone else said she realized she hates the way her husband chews his food LMAO.  COVID has made us all closely examine the lives we've built for ourselves.  People are going cuckoo because of all the time spent with their kids. Chile... No one saw this coming. Anyway, I've been with you for years. Changed my username a few times. But you are still "Our Pat," and I will stay down through the next chapter. Take care and be well, sweet girl ❤
Beautiful Patricia every thing will be ok , l am going through this right now mood swings anxiety  all this started with the lock down.
No matter what anyone else says, you won’t be able to see how gorgeous you are. You have to accept yourself as you are to really see it. It’s ok to want to change your body. It just sucks that we live in a society that is constantly pushing the image of the “perfect” body on us. Please know that it’s only you who sees yourself as flawed... the rest of us think you are radiant and stunning just as you are. Xx
Exhale! This too shall pass.
Love your new attitude❤❤❤
Love you Pat! It is not easy walking through this crazy times being a mom, a wife, a business woman and a Patricia. Just remember that highs and lows are a part of a beating heart. I can totally relate to what you said relationship wise. Today alone i cried like crazy as we fought for some rubish stuff that keep happening. Now we dont even  remember what we were fighting about😐  Stay strong and more rational than emotional everyone.
Thank you for your honesty.
I'm really sorry to hear you're not feeling too well. Patricia, I pray that all goes well with your family and your marriage. Please keep well. XOXO! 🤗🤗
I’ve watched Patricia for so long and I never knew she has a second chanel called the break, why does she never link it in the description🥺
Get better soon and let's turn 2020 around
This is why if I ever have a child I'm going to tell them the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 💞
"It's also strong to be soft" I love that
Hi Patricia I rarely comment on YouTube but I just wanted to offer you support. Being a woman is hard, being a mum is hard, being a wife is hard, having medical problems is hard. You're beautiful and you shouldn't feel self conscious. You sound like you're on the path to self healing and I hope you find your happiness ✨
Deal with family issues on a need to know basis Patricia. We, as viewers, love you but that's all we are. We're not family or even close friends so keep viewers out of your personal space. I will pray for you and your beautiful family in hopes that everything will work out. ❤
Appreciate you being vulnerable. It’s unreal....I am going through everything you said plus 1 yr old twins, and home schooling my oldest. I felt so overwhelmed and didn’t know how to handle it. Even made things “seem” ok as a strong black women. I am only 2 therapy appointments in and they have been helping me communicate and express myself to my husband(never an issue before)and not holding things in.... I try to stay optimistic for 2020/21
Sending all the love Patricia❤️❤️❤️
Also, I’m glad that you guys are working really hard on your marriage. I remember in the assumptions about me box on IG, my assumption was that your relationship was on shaky ground. Y’all are honestly goals and your family is beautiful so I’m holding out for you!
thank you for sharing your transparency with us. you've inspired so many people including myself to better ourselves financially, career-wise etc. I can't wait to see you level up for yourself and share that with us too. you deserve to feel as beautiful on the outside as you are on the inside! x
I love this top on you! The colors are complimentary
“Lean into my fears further “ that sounds amazing ! What if any books are u reading right now P
Literally you are so brave I appreciate you so much. You are strong. You inspire me as a woman and as an aspiring entrepreneur and I feel you give advice like a bigger sister which is something to appreciate in a person. Being real and down to Earth is something everyone should be. We need to stop this madness of feeding this social monster and be more who we actually are. And I think the world would be a better place. Thank you for sharing. It made me feel better in the sense that it made me realize that I am not the only one struggling ( no one should struggle) and it inspired me to be braver and stronger. Love u Patricia :)
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Who dafuq was talking shit about Queen Pat and Modhel Mike???? Whoooo?? I’m ready to throw hands!
I hear u on the relationship side, girl its been tough. Just bring in the house and not having any personal or work goals really wore me out. Got to the point where I took it out on the hubby and it was just not a great situation
Your the best patricia so glad I came across your page because you always make me laugh and I love how real you are
I look forward to seeing where your new path takes you!! Also this bob is gorgeous
Some interesting insights! I never knew that your name wasn't Bright! Learn something new everyday!! 👍
We don’t want perfect you. Just your authentic self is amazing
Thank you Patricia for being honest . I thought about your surname recently and was so sure it wasn't bright. Glad you are owning your next chapter, do you and we will stand by you. Btw I recently experienced same and with the tight support I was able to share on my channel and my internet fam were supportive to my surprise .
Thanks Patricia for sharing your truth. Keep doing you! Trust the process. Everything is going to be fine🤍
Wishing you all the love and light for your relationship- you will get through this, have faith, it's a very difficult time, you are meant to be together xxxx
I feel it is very powerful and refreshing to hear others talk about these struggles.  Love and hugs from Cali!
Hi Patŕicia Life is ups and downs  but remember JESUS is the Answer only GOD  knows Speak to GOD
Whatever content you put out we’ll love it!
Ugghhhh my heart, Patricia!! I'm truly wishing the best for you and and your family
Thank you for keeping it real and opening up. Proud of you
oh girl you helped me so much with your video ❤️
Thank you Patricia for your truth!!!!! We love you here in Tampa Florida, USA!
Hope you get everything you need, only found your videos recently but have helped me a lot! ❤️
We're here for you Patricia 💕! Sending so much love, and excitement for the future ✨
I love Patricia she’s so authentic 🤎
I love u and ur husband Mike. Just live ur truth and free ur mind. We love u guys.
I love your transparency here. I can definitely relate. I believe this period of time caused many of us to do some much needed self reflection.
I’ve lost so many people this year to mental health struggles and it’s always the people I see as strong and put together, people need to feel like they can let their walls down stop putting on a brave face and own their emotions, admit when things aren’t going well and let others guide you through when you need a hand. I admire your bravery for coming out with this video Patricia, I hope it opens doors for people to break through the walls they put up. So much love x
We love you keep going ❤️
I appreciate your honesty and sincerity. I can and do absolutely relate with this video. This year has been crap and my fears have been front and center throughout this whole year. My fears have affected Everything!! My plan is to do the best I can while can. Let my loved ones know they are loved and just cherish each day. Thank you so much for sharing. I know it was hard to do. I want you to know, I see you, I appreciate you and I support you. Take care
Can't wait to see what's in store 😁
Patricia! Your videos really helped me get through a tough time in 2016 and your amazing energy was a key contributor to cheering me up and getting me back on my feet. I hope you know your fans are sending you that same positive energy back and hoping things get back on the upside! Love you!
Who remembers Britpopprincess ? 🙋🏾‍♀️ I do! I’ve been watching Patricia for yearsss.   I love everything you do & what you stand for, 2020 has been a tough year for many of us. Plant your heart in gratitude because things could be a lot worse. I pray that God may grant you peace & love within yourself & those around you 💜
You Look good now, you have to realise it Patricia
One of the most genuine videos you have made. So much more relatable when real life issues are discussed . Thanks for sharing x
This is hella relatable. Thank you for giving us the real and raw side of life. It’s so necessary.
Love you Patricia!!! Every situation you go through will pass, tomorrow is a new day! ❤️ I’ve been here since 2016 and don’t plan on leaving! Also, I am trying the yoni pearls and stream and they may help a lot!
Love you pat! You’ve been my idol since I was 17 (I’m 26 now) & it holds true today. Ur fears are valid but as usual you have PUSHED through & did the first steps. I only hope that motivates ppl like myself who still live in fear to do the same. Sending Alllll my love from NYC❤️❤️❤️
You and mike cannot give up
Thank you for being your most authentic self. I treasure your honesty and content immensely ❤️
I had been following you when quarantine started and your channel (The break platform) helped me so much through this times. I remember the night I watched your first video, it changed so much for me. I then discovered this other channel and I found your third channel last week 🤗 You are an amazing woman❤️ You are a human, no human is perfect, no one. You are not alone, this time is bringing all kind of struggles to our Humanity. It’s Okay to not have all put together, no one was prepared for this, and is totally normal to struggle in this current circumstances. Whatever new content you will decide to create I will follow you. You are an inspiration for me and I feel you represent many of us, black women. Better times will come, the current time is hard but if we manage to keep going through there is Hope.
Thank you for being so open and sharing. I think you choosing to be more open will inspire a lot of people. Praying for your mental health and family. God bless
The year has humbled everyone. It’s kind of a re birth before millions miss their authentic destiny. Things will be ok . God knows your name
Your surname isnt Bright?? Wht???  I cant believe it.....this was my biggest take away....everything else will be well 😘
Dude you are so amazing and inspiring!!!!!! I will always admire you!!!!
You can't be serious!?!? You look good !
Love you 💕
Thanks for being open and honest
May God bless your family and may he protect your marriage always.
So happy you confided in your community by sharing struggles we're all facing this yeah. I love an even more relatable Patricia. 💘
Thank you for sharing. I’m on a similar journey. God has a plan. Everything will be as it should be. Happy Trails!
You are such a beautiful person and these things will pass too. Hopefully there will be a vaccine soon, and we can get back to a more normal life.
👏🏼👏🏼 I’m nodding along to just everything you’re saying! Yasss. Prioritise that beautiful family of yours!! Excited for a change up in content if that’s what you want to share
The people I appreciate the most are the real ones Thanks Patricia
thank you for sharing this with us. this video is very timely and very powerful, and I appreciate that you're able to always keep it real with us ❤️
I freaking love you. You’re so honest with yourself and it’s wonderful. Praying for your success!!!
thank you so much for this video, you have comforted me so much just by sharing your truth and i’m sure many others also. you are such a strong woman and i feel like the word inspiration is thrown around very loosely but you are a real one. sending my love 💘
Hi Patricia thank you. Thank you for your honesty. I don't think you can understand the impact you have on people that watch your videos. I don't have anyone in my real life that I can relate to and never had. I've always had to look into myself and figure out how to continue in life. I'm in an interracial relationship, living with my fiance and his 10y/o daughter. I've never had any contact with my African side, therefore I don't have any cultural part of me missing. However, once you can't find anyone in your real life to guide you, you turn to the next best thing, the people in the internet (Youtube). This year several interracial couples have split/divorced "out of nowhere" and this has a huge impact on people watching. Obviously it is not your responsibility to let us know how you relationship is going, but but letting us know that things aren't great and you are working on it helps to better understand the "unperfect" life everyone (internet and real life) has. Thank you for being you and thank you for constantly trying to keep us entertained. We are here for you. Love from Portugal.
Aww P sending you lots of love and just positive vibes 💖
The changes women go through are endless. Wait until you get to perimenopause and transition to menapause. That is something they dont teach you in school.
This year made me closer to Jesus, we all need to seek him🥰
I rate you for this, it just make me feeling like I’m not the only one struggling especially during these times ❣️
Thank you for your honesty keep looking deep within, you've got this :)
I’ve been struggling with panic attacks for the first time in my life this year. Some days I couldn’t get out of bed. My husband didn’t know how to handle it. Sometimes he’d make it worse. I felt like I was tearing us apart. It’s gotten so much better in the past couple months. it has made us stronger.  My advice is to take the time you need. find love for yourself. prioritize what is important to YOU And what makes YOU happy. Make sure you hear your partner out in the same way. I know you will make it through this. You are blessed. Stay thankful. (This goes out to everyone reading this too)
Patricia 2020 has been a monster for us all, in all aspects. Praying for you and your lovely family. You’ve got this!
Thank you sharing all that you've been going through. Missed your real content! Love to hear from you. Imperfections and all ❤ sending blessings for continued health and for your personal life to be on the up and up.. I think we've all had it with 2020
Never change yourself for other people’s approval because they won’t be approving the real you 💕
I’ve been here since waaaaaaay since you were doing week in outfits for work. You’re beautiful and said many a truths here. I wish you and your family all the best. It’s hard out here.
Wow I love you being honest  Sending you some prayers and hug darling
I love you that’s why I’m here. Strong or not.
This year has been so much. My mental health has tried to finish me. But we’re here still. It will be well.
Really respect your honesty and tbh that's what I prefer from creators but please look after yourself 💖 This year has been tough on everyone!
I love you Patricia. Bright is an awesome pseudonym, but I think a lot of us guessed it wasn't your surname. I personally thought you used it as a play on your wonderful personality.
Thank you for being so honest with you I appeciate that and wish you all the best. It is a hard year and you telling us your story helps me too and motivates me to work to be the best version of myself. ❤️
At this point we need to be besties because you said my exact thoughts sis.   Sending lots of love from a fellow stressed and probably depressed sis, wife, working, tired mummy of 2 too.  Instagram- msleannealicia ❤️
Thank you for being so open ❤️
Thank you Patricia. Sending love 🧡
This video made me cry.  Peace to you and your family and everyone you love. It's been really hard and I feel like what we need more of is compassion for those around us and for ourselves. We tend to be hardest on ourselves at times and we all need to take deep breathes and take into account the beauty and love in the little things in life.
Thank you for your transparency. There's a lot of us that can relate with a lot of things. 'Trying to keep up' is draining. It's time for self love and healing. I wish you the best Patricia ❤️
2020, has been hard for everyone.  I applaud you for sharing these road blocks publicly.  You are a Bright moment for certain, remember that.  Look forward to new events.
It's been a tough year for everyone, I can't wait for 2020 to end and hopefully we can all move on to better things
Thank you Soo much for sharing Patricia. You are authentic and it is refreshing. This has been educational. Literally no one tells you about these things.
❤
It makes me so sad to hear you’ve been feeling down Pat. We love you though no matter what! I was watching this documentary on here called “consumerism” or maybe it was called consumption” & they were just talking about how it’s sort of set up for us not to have time to think because we’d like become more “radical” and so now that quarantine has happened I feel like now everyone CAN think about their life betterment. I’m glad you’ve gotten to think too regardless!  I just wish we could think about ourselves more often but not due to a negative event. Maybe that will be the future. But I’ll be here Patricia for sure no matter the content! Xoxoxo
I don’t think it’s wise to fully open up about your marriage or home life in general. Yeah it’s ok to say life, marriage, etc. isn’t perfect, but now you’re putting a spotlight on it and opening yourself up to more criticism. It’s none of our business. I don’t want you to put more pressure on your marriage/life for views. You don’t owe us anything. Take care of yourself. Just food for thought 🥴
December 31, 2019 I decided to cut off the last social media outlet I was using, because it wasn't working for me and I understood that I had the power. These platforms are a tool and if they are not being used for my highest good... then I DON'T NEED THEM. Being real shouldn't be this hard for us if we are REAL WITH SELF. but the worry of what others will say or feel etc has kept some of us back, so as someone who has had to see *&(*&9 that,  I can say living for others is NEVER WORTH IT! BE YOU AND BE TRUE. If people can't hang let them go and wish them well. YOU WILL BE BETTER FOR IT.
Sending love love love
I always appreciate your honesty when you talk about issues like this I wouldn't be comfortable doing this honestly. Do what's best and never forget some peeps are never happy with your decisions. Thanks for being you always. X
Been here since Brit Pop Princess. I remember when you explained the name change. Keep going, God has got you!
I so appreciate your courage to share personal pieces of your life with us 🙏🏾 2020 definitely has been a rough one but we will all get thru it in the name of Jesus. We just have to continue to keep the faith. Praying for a brighter future for us all
Love the transparency. I smiled throughout the video because you are so brave for speaking your truth. Don’t ever let anyone tell you that you are disclosing too much personal information or not enough personal information! You have a voice and you are helping to inspire others. God bless you and your family! 🙏🏾
thank you so much for sharing and for being real and vulnerable. You can sure have a better live, you go and get it girl xxx
Praying for you, Mike and the family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧
the part about working through your fears really hit home. i love you p
I was praying for not hearing anything bad about relationship. I mean me and my husband almost ate each other alive during quarantine but we realised how much learning and patience it takes to understand each other. And everybody has ups and downs in a relationship so I hope it goes away with effort. I love you so much Patricia. Wish you everything best honestly with all my heart. You are a powerful woman we  look up to and yes you can have bad moments too it's normal! This is why we love you, you show us how to be a normal human and achieve so much.
Thanks for sharing, it’s a process of healing. Love, happiness,family and health to you and your family 🙏🏾💝
Thank you for opening up to your community. Thank you for your honesty and transparency. It takes a lot of courage to put everything out there in the open. Especially in this day and age where people love  to criticise and judge others whitout knowing what they are going through behind closed doors. You are an inspiration for many. Keep up the good work. Your community loves and appreciates you.  And to all the women out there going through though times: sorrow may last for the night, but joy comes in the morning. Everyrhing that has a beginning also has an ending. Nothing is forever. It might take longer than expected but you are going to figure it out and get through it and come out stronger. May the Lord almighty give you the strength and endurance that you need to overcome those thought times.  God bless yall.
Patricia, we heard all that you're saying and I for one understand the difficulties of a relationship especially, in these times.  It sounds to an extent as if you're forewarning us.  Please, you and Michael, try very hard not to allow your years together and your commitment to end.  Remember, in these last days anything that can be shaken; will be shaken.  Please stay prayed up.  Much love for you and your family.
I often remind myself: fear kills more dreams than failure ever will. So Bravo, lean into your fears! I found it truly boosts personal growth.
Love you big sis ❤️ Praying for you and your family ❤️
Listen!!!! I’ll say this because I know you are Christian. ‘Superwoman syndrome’ can have us dealing with all these emotions and mind games and it’s only natural. The ability to step back, see it and be vocal about it as you have done is major. However, one big fat step towards making it all lighter is to leave it at the feet of Jesus. Daily find comfort and peace in his word and exchange your weakness for his strength. Take extra care of your spirit wo(man) and watch your body and soul align. I pray for an abundance of grace to keep shining your light. 🤗
Ms Patricia Is just PRECIOUS.  Praying for you Ma❤️🙏🏾🥺 and looking forward to see all the good to come!
What I would do to look like you and have a body like that... Keep your marriage personal and to yourself it is none of our business what goes on between you and your spouse. But from one Patricia to another you have so many things that other people do not have. Just thank God for what you have because somebody will come in and enjoy what you have that you don't enjoy. I think you are so beautiful and so real and I enjoy your videos!
Your such a strong inspiring woman Patricia ✨🌸❤️🧡💜 loved this video
Thank you for sharing, hope you're feeling lighter and better in your skin. We love you 💖
Listen...I’ve been subscribed to you since day dot...like the actual beginning but it’s only when I did your course I realised your name wasn’t Patricia Bright! I was like 😲😲😲😲 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  On a serious note, yesssss girl...live your truth because at the end of the day that’s all we have 🤷🏾‍♀️ I love seeing the fam because you guys are authentic and Mike is hilarious 😂 but even if you try it and decide again it’s too much just know, we love you regardless!  Keep your head up Queen!💜
I needed this in sooo many ways! I identify with so much of what you shared!! Thanks Patricia
I will be part to that journey, thank you for invite us! Very inspiring of you to share your life openly to the World like you do so well. Respect ✊🏾 We’ll be watching’ 💯 🙌🏾
Many, many blessings, beautiful.
What I'm seeing is internet and social media breaking up relationships and breaking up people. It is sad. Please stop comparing yourself to others. Do not feel the need to post everything and to justify everything you do. Learn how to love yourself. Please take care of your feelings and the ones around you.
We needed this, were all going through it this year 🙏 wish you well
Looking forward to going on this journey with you!
Yes 2020 is determined NOT be forgotten but you be determined to find a little joy every day! The very best to you and your family! ❤️🙏🏾
Loves👑
God help you woman and your marriage too stay strong 💪🙏 🤗
Thank you for your transparency ♥️ It helps more than you realize.
I'm sending love and best wishes to you. The idea of losing my best friend and life partner scares me. I hope you two can pull through this.
I needed to hear this! I had my first baby in February this year and soon after broke up with my baby daddy and being a single parent during this pandemic has really been hard. I've been depressed more than I've even been aware and I'm not the type of person to get depressed.  Thank you for opening up. I love your personality and your quirk, I look forward to seeing more of your real life ❤️
Love you, be you all the time we can take it, that's why we are still here!😍😍😍😍😍
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. Can we stop as women being so focused on our bodies?  Why is it women are always talking about their bodies, and body image? Men don't do that crap. Why do women do it?  We are more than our bodies by far.
I was literally binge watching britpoplife all weekend and saying to myself that i need to comment to Patricia next time she uploads that she needs to bring it back when this notification came on. i immediately clicked on and she had this to say! To Patricia: i love you and Mike way too much together and your beautiful babies. You guys give me hope to still believe in true companionship because after my last abusive relationship I wanted no part of another. But you guys keep my heart warm instead of cold and hard. I pray that you and Mike come through together. I really do. Tough times don't last but tough people do. The quarantine is temporary but stay strong guys...
Pls work on it life  is real child all must be well ok you  can go through
When Patricia said her surname is not even "Bright" I was like 😳😳😳 "Guys we have been *hoodwinked* " what is going on here lol
Thanks for your transparency b/c you didnt have to share... yet we appreciate the honesty pat! God will work everything out. Don't worry 😊 Such a great camera & lighting set up btw! Love the quality!
i admire you so much for your honesty in this video. here’s to a blessed rest of 2020 and beyond 🤍
Neaded to hear this today
Thank you for sharing all of that Patricia. I know a lot of people have also shared they are struggling but I appreciate it being shared on social media where everything is always ‘perfect’. Also, it’s genuinely good to hear that you’re coping and feeling more open now. I know I don’t know you but human to human, I’m so glad you’re doing better. Love to you and your family ❤️
I love you❤️
Patricia you look absolutely stunning....all these colors in your dress complements your skin so nicely. Also do what makes you happy and protect your personal space and relationships with your family at all cost. Do not apologize for it, we will be here for any content that you want to bless us with. Kisses 😘
We support u! Whatever makes you happy!❣️💕☺️
I just realised i have been watching you for years and I sent your videos to my friends. And I’ve stuck around because of your energy, enthusiasm and realness. I will continue to watch you whatever you decide to post. Don’t be afraid to post what you want. Its part of your growth of who you are. Fear is the devil.  💓💜
I think 2020 has been an eye opener for a a lot of people... truly shows what we do have instead of what we think we don’t have when so many people are suffering all over the world and have absolutely nothing. God willing, give us the strength & good health to go on 🙏🏻 Totally been missing you and can’t wait for more of your content... pls show ur journey into getting the procedure your looking at... I can totally relate... after 4 kids I miss my old body! 😩
You’re very brave for sharing this bit about yourself and your life. Though it’s not really our business, as a follower it’s hard to not look at your social media and videos and think, “wow, I wish and need to get to her success, stability and happiness” without knowing what’s really happening. I feel like everyone lives in a facade of perfection and it really effects everyone from you to your followers in a negative way. So thank you for being real with everyone and transparent. And thank you for encouraging everyone to take care of themselves and not be ashamed to take care of themselves or even admit that they need to take time for themselves.
It can take just as much strength to be vulnerable as it does to be strong. You have to break those walls down just a bit at a time. Looking forward to all the upcoming context whatever it might be :) sending (slightly more open heart) wishes 😊
Thanks so much for your vulnerability Patricia ❤ I've been following you for a while now -- back when you and Mike were dating and I've always loved how real you were. I hope things start changing for the better for all of us because this has been an insanely difficult year. Sending you love, prayers and good vibes ❤❤
We love you and are here for you. You are the most inspirational youtuber I watch and I love the break as well. Thank you for sharing this intimate side of you. Can't wait for future content on your next phase in life. ❤
I’ve been watching you for some years now and Patricia all will work itself out. It’s just going to take time and everyone is going through a great deal of unusual changes during this time. Stay motivated and do what you feel is necessary for your next chapter. ✨
Thanks for sharing Patricia xx
Sending you lots of love and light 🤗 You’ve got this woman. Most of all God’s got you always ❣️
Praying for you! I wish nothing but the best for you and your family.❤️
Sending all the love and positive vibes your way Patricia! I love you, I love the person you are and thank you for sharing whatever you want to share with us. It felt like listening to a friend. We’re here to see you grow as a wife, a mother, a black woman and we’ll support you no matter what. 🙏🏽
havent watched the video yet,, but who else saw Jackie Aina wear this same dress??
Babe we are all in the same boat, u are not alone! Sending love to u and ur family 😘
I would also like to make a confession that I’m one of those people who though her name was actually Patricia BRIGHT all these years !! 2020 is indeed  eye opening haha
Share only what you feel comfortable sharing, Patricia.  We all rush to watch your videos b/c you are a bright light in our lives.  Your happiness and your smiling face is our happiness.  Your beautiful family makes us happy as well.  I’m thrilled to hear that little Nova is improving!  Such a gorgeous baby.🥰🥰
Wait, what ?   Her surname  is not really  Bright😳
I'm so glad your sweet daughter is doing better!   For you and Mike, I do think it is good to reserve your relationship, for the most part. Relationships are partnerships, and they're not anyone else's business unless you want to make it so.   Thanks for being open about what you're going through. It's a great example, since so many people feel they need to shut themselves away. I hope you continue to heal and find productive, peaceful ways to go forward.
Patricia I’m so proud of you for taking this leap!! I for one, am gonna be here with you wherever you take this channel. I’ve always loved your personality and your outlook on life. Sending you & your family all the love in the world! 💕🥰🤗
phew on the Mike front... stay strong guys!  you got this 💝
Girl thank you for sharing your truth!! From Brooklyn, NY 🙏
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Patricia, you’ve got this xx
Hi Patricia, I appreciate you being candid so please take a word of advice from someone older. In all that you’re planning to do, please PRIORITIZE and put your FAMILY FIRST.  Work on your marriage because Success is empty without your loved ones to share it with.
Thank you @Patricia Bright for sharing your true self with us. We do appreciate it. Chapeau 🙏🏿
So here for this Patricia!! Thank you for your bravery  🤍
Thank your for sharing! A gentle reminder that we live by grace and in our weakness he is made strong! 💓
As much as I enjoy the content, I don’t believe you owe us any transparency. I'm okay with you not sharing the personal sides of your life because you don’t owe me it. I’ve been here watching since the ’fiancé tag’ lol and I've always enjoyed the separation between you and your personal life. Irrespective if we engage with your content or if we buy into your brand financially, you don’t owe us anything. I chose to engage with you but that doesn’t mean you have to share with me. Leaning into your truth might mean being private about your life and allowing people to assume. I don’t know if it’s just black women but I never see anyone ask women of other ethnicities to be transparent and open about their private life, it’s like we don’t believe their success until we see their struggle.   However, if you find sharing like this therapeutic and cathartic then go ahead, because those day one subscribers you speak of, we ride with you either way ❤️
Patricia, I have been following your chanel for a while, and this is one of the most beautiful video you have published. 💕 Hope you feel better. Take care of youself.
Hey, we love you
Just hang in there Patricia ❤️
For everyone, this year has been mad for MULTIPLE reasons but I am honestly sending prayers your way!
Totally understand. In marriage coaching currently with a couple team. This years is rough. Youngest hospitalized then marriage being truly revealed and then having lost my authentic self through all these years just to keep the peace. Saying serious prayers for you and yours as well. 2020 grrrr testing me deeply
love you Patricia <3
Yessss Patricia stay 😇HONEST, stay STRONG💪 and stay 🙏TRUE, live for your family they are the main focus and yourself, 💖Love your videos #womenareremarkable💖
I think we are all guilty of having a bit of a self deprivation attitude about ourselves at times. But at some point you must be able to look yourself in the mirror and say "I'm ok, and I like who I am". No one is perfect and time is wasted on perfectionism. Enjoy the here and now because soon it's over.
Thank you for sharing with us! 2020 has been rough... but like you said it is going to get better!
💕💕💕💕💕
Love you ❤️
Thank you Patricia for sharing your life with us. You’ll pull through this, take it a day at a time. Take social media breaks when needed, pray, meditate, hold on, you’ve got this. You’re beautiful just the way you are. You don’t have to look any other way except as you are, praying you’ll find the peace and anchor for yourself and your family, together ❤️❤️
Same with my marriage. Everyone made a joke of how quarantine would casques divorce but it’s not funny. No one is used to being stuck inside with their spouse 24/7
thank you for sharing❤️ sending my love to you
Pretty🤩🤩🤩😎
I agree with you, I want a better life for my family and I. Stay positive even through the sad things that have been happening. I pray that everyone gets to the point where they can see the light at the end. I pray that everybody makes it.
Hi Patricia, thank you for being so open.. Change is always great but you have been great as well, you put out very good content regularly, that is a reason to be proud... You don’t look awful, you look great! Your body is healing and some things take time, but do whatever makes you happy.  In regards to your marriage, I don’t think you need to be sharing more.. I think the internet makes people feel like they deserve intimacy. This forced intimacy was not earned by most people that will view your videos. You deserve your privacy and to protect you private life. That will not make your admirers admire you less.
Patricia thank you for being transparent! We love you just as you are. God accepts you just as you are! And He can bless you with the desires of your heart. 💚💚
will always love u 100%
I love how she shines a light on some hard life situations. You never know who else is going through the same thing, and this could make them feel a little less alone in that struggle.
❤️💖❤️💖
Gurl.. be you. Take care of you and we're all hear for it. Ps. Patricia to me you look amazing, and realize that what you realized about yourself in the past is true today. You are beautiful and powerful and doing soo much. Thank you for doing something that you really don't have to.
You go, girl! I feel a little less like a loser in comparison now! Please take heart from knowing that no matter what, there are literally thousands of people out there who love and support you, without judgment. You're fabulous!
Such a beautiful video and messages. There is so much support Bogor you here. Keeping being your true self.
Surname ain't Bright? Wow
I’ve been subscribed to you since britpopprincess days and you have remained my favourite, you are so so authentic and that’s what makes you so great. Thank you for sharing 🤍🤍
This video is proof that you are strong! I'm here for this!!!!!
Sending you and your family love! 💕💕 It’s tough at the moment, but I have faith you’ll come out stronger. Wishing you the best Pat x ❤️
Thank you for this, loving hearing other people sharing their truth, especially right now. I just ended a long term relationship and I'm finding it really helpful just hearing people who have broken up or made it work in this time.   If he wanted to put in the effort he would have, so each experience I hear that goes either way kind of affirms that for me.   2021 should be a brilliant rebirth for us all ❤️
Thank you for being so honest & opening up about your personal life. Praying for you that your health issues will be taken care of & that you have lots of faith in God & yourself!  Blessed Sunday!🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I can only imagine how hard it must be so open and vulnerable online knowing that people are so mean online. I loved this video, it´s much appreciated. Xoxo
Before she said Hey guys I had already liked the video😭😭😂
This is a very moving video with your confessions.  I wish you perfect health and pure contentment.
Patricia YOU LOOK GREAT NOW!!!!!!!!You are sooooo hard on yourself.
😘😘😘
You’re the strongest !! We know you’ve got this, I’ve been subscribed since 2014 and your journey has been soul touching. Love you 🤍
You'll be fine!!You have this inside!!!You are a good person and you deserve what's best from life!I wish you from my heart and with all my onesty to all your dreams to came true!!!♡♡♡☆☆☆And to be healthy because is the most important thing!!!
Patricia.. Use therapy, is a great tool to unleash the things that are getting at you, i was so against it but now i ambso happy that i went 2 years ago. 'it changed me to hear myself talking out loud.. That way i could hear my problems and could decide if  there was a way to fix them or not🌹
sending you all of my love 😘😘😘😘😘 God bless you
Honey, chile (smh)... when you speak it’s like I hear myself. Patricia, bless you for sharing your personal events with us,  because God knows you didn’t have to - you owe us nothing in that respect. I’m so glad to hear your beautiful bubba is much better health-wise. And I’m wishing you, Mike and your family all the love in the world.
Wishing you the Best! :)
I’ve been following you for 9 years! I can wait for the next chapter. I’m currently going through my own transformation journey. Since I don’t want to be afraid of the world (judgement) anymore. Congrats on doing things for yourself :)
Thank you for sharing. I too have been on a self-growth journey for more than a year own and I am still on it. It's is process but I so happy i decided to work on me and be selfish after almost 28 years of butting others first. I hope we will be able to encourage and support in this new journey. Love you
Love you Patrica praying for you, your children and marriage 💕
❤️❤️
We’re here for it all Patricia! Keep shining ❤️
Screw people. Do what's best for you guys.
Wish you and your husband the best. Take time out for you two and I pray for your success and happiness xxxx
... I think you are beautiful and so inspiring... Thanks for sharing
It will get better as long as you make a conscious effort.. You are strong and it's okay to take a break for that. 💯
do u want to know how i discovered your channel ? i saw a comment you posted on cardi b's video WAP  i watched all your videos it's like I've seen you growing  i love u ❤️
Sending love strength and prayers🙏🏽
I love when you're real because I'm a jamaican women, mother, wife and everything. And I'm going through it too. And I've been watching you for years and getting this from you is such a breath of fresh air. Actually brings me closer to you. God bless you, your family and your marriage. Work at it.... your fam is most important and ofcourse your self improvement
Thanks for sharing, I think this year has been draining for us all. I pray God’s peace over your life.
Baby baby baby I must confess I have not listen to your entire vlog because right now I’m sitting on my back porch for the first time in 7 or 8 days but just from the start I understand where you are and I love you for it. I’m in Detroit and I’m old enough to be your mother, my son is 33 and I’m still going through all the worries and I’m not into social media. I’m amazed and stunned at all the things you guys go through to make it and I’m Evers so proud of you each and every day. You are a champion and a survivor and a truly beautiful woman. Later I will finish watching your vlog and probably add more comment but right now I just want say you know you are truly blessed and highly favored. You got your family and friends and you are talented and resourceful, the struggle is more than real and we are all living it with you. Much much much love.  love 💕
Love the top 😍
So wait if her surname is not bright what is it?
The realist auntie 💕
Love u aunty patsy glad nova is better!
This entire year has been too much for me, I admire how you've persevered and man, it is so hard to do personally. I hope that everything will be better and that my mental health will improve too
No disrespect or anything, but isn't it crazy that the people who aren't comfortable in their bodies tend to show a lot of their bodies? It's really a mystery.
Really enjoyed this raw and authentic video. Wishing you love & light and I'd also like to say that you ARE strong, you've been through a lot and you're still willing to go through more! Keep being the light that you are! Love from Trinidad and Tobago ❤
Thanks for sharing. Take care of yourself Patricia!
I felt this video to my core! You are so brave. I have noticed over the time that I have watched your channel just how much I look up to you! ❤️
I kind of noticed when you were extremely hard on yourself in regards to loosing weight. Stay safe healthy and strong xx
We love you Patricia no matter what! You are a ray of sunshine, so please don't let the pandemic / personal life stress make you doubt your value or looks!
You are amazing.
Patricia you’re incredible, sending all the support your way. We’ve all got this together xx
Thanks for being transparent with Us.  It’s always great to just be yourself. ❤️
Hey Patricia, Thx 4 sharing, hang in there,will keep u& ur family in prayer,we all r dealing w/something so u r not alone, :-),look fwd 2 more videos, Take care& be safe
I love how you are so open and honest about life as a Youtuber/Mother/Wife/Businesswoman. I respect you so much.
The Bright family is not a real thing😱😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂woooow
For 2020 my only goal is to stay alive and be kinder to myself. We need to be able to rest. We cannot keep being strong for every one but ourselves. Rest at this point is an act of resistance lol. And I totally relate to the body dysmorphia! When i thought I was heavier and having gone through changes I'm like... Girl wth was you complaining about? But it definitely helps us to appreciate each progress we make, wether it be to change or just accept our body. Social media doesn't always help, so unplugging is definitely necessary from time to time for me. We are here for all your transparency!! 🧡
So proud of you and your journey!! 🥰🥰 thank you for sharing  your truth
Sending loads of love and positive energy to you! 🙌🏻
Awww praying for you and Mike!
Life is unbelievably hard at the moment and I think all women think they should be holding work, family, life and everything together. It is so hard! It's not weak to ask for help but I think a lot of women don't realise that. Ask for help if you need it. 💓💓
For all of us I think we can all agree it’s been a crap year but knowing we all didn’t experience it alone is comforting and I look forward to watch you be real with us or be goofy excited and silly, we love all parts and appreciate you showing them to us💕
You look great now hon. No matter what, we will be here to support you. I am supporting all the way from Trinidad and Tobago.
Alot of Self Care and be Patient with yourself. Take time out when you feel tired. Coming together with husband be their for each other. Change and Balance, Blessings ❣️
You’re such an amazing person and you have a beautiful family. We’re here for you 💕
This was powerful. The power of sharing is liberating. Thank you for your vulnerability, Patricia. Putting yourself out there on the internet can be intimidating especially knowing how the court of public opinion is scary! I personally believe that personal therapy can help. I know the Black Community in particular places (like Africa where I am) going for therapy isn't wasn't deemed as being important. But it really helps people deal with some of the issues we face on a daily basis. Issues in your life in general and especially issues in relationships. I don't really feel like couples therapy is as effective as each person within the relationship going for individual therapy. That's just my personal opinion but I can understand that it works for some. Sometimes the issues are not stemming from the relationship itself but more from individual issues. And sometimes our mental state as well. From personal experience, often times the issues we deal with in our relationships are individual issues that project onto our relationships. Understanding why we react when our partners do something or understanding the reason why we get upset over certain situations helps to tackle the root cause. It's reflective and helps us understand ourselves better and individual therapy helps us prioritize our mental state. We are able to process our feelings and emotions better when we can have time to offload and talk to someone.   So when both people within a relationship are willing to work on it, and both decide to go see therapists individually, when they come together it's easier to communicate when they've understood themselves and their emotions better. For example, if a woman goes to her therapists and one of the issues she has is her man doesn't listen - she can better understand why she feels that way - is because of a past relationship? Is it because of childhood trauma? Is it because he really just doesn't listen? Lol, maybe you can give him some grace in that area?   In the case of the man, he can say "well my lady feels like I don't listen to her", well why is that? Did something happen in the past that makes you do things without listening? How can you improve and make her know you listen or are trying to listen?   Sometimes people outgrow each other and therapy doesn't work. But if people are willing to work on themselves to ensure a healthier relationship then it never reaches a breakdown. That way you are both willing to grow and learn at the same pace and level of communication.   I cannot speak about domestic violence or emotional abuse issues. I have never been in any of the two so I cannot say what works or not. I also cannot say if you feel like the relationship must end to try therapy, nope, if you are confident that this is the end then by all means believe in your decision. It only works if you are with someone who wants to make it work and both of you are on the same page of saving and sustaining the relationship. But that is just my two cents on some of the challenges we may have in relationships during this difficult time in our lives.
We love you! You got this 💪🏾 🌈
The reason why I love your vids so much is because of your continuing realness. Especially in moments like these. Each time you share your vulnerability, it encourages me to show my own. Because your way of being shows me that you can be strong but also be in pain at times, and that that's ok. Lots of love to you and your fam 💛
Patricia is such a cutie
I think influencers and people with a social media presence have such high pressures to show that they’re always put together. it’s unrealistic and harmful for not only yourself but also for your viewers watching. I also struggle with being vulnerable and it’s something I’m working on so I appreciated this so much 🖤
Sending you much love Patricia ♥️♥️
This video is hella refreshing. Thank you for your honesty xx
Love this x
My father passed away unexpectedly last month. I never thought this was what 2020 was going to bring us. It's turned my life upside down. I'm hoping that the rest of this year will be more hopeful & positive bc Idk how much more of this I can take /:
2020 has been absolutely crazy💔I pray the rest of the year will be amazing for all of us.🙏🏾
Love ❤️ you Patricia, please stay bright! We, I need it in this world🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Thank you so much for being real. We need more influencers to show us real life behind the fashion, holidays etc. Young people’s expectations of ‘real life’ is being distorted by the facade people show online. We need to use our online presence more wisely. This is a great start Patricia, keep going.
Thank you for sharing Patricia. I do hope that you show yourself lots of compassion for who you are and what you have to do amidst life as it is now. Truly you are doing the best that you can. I hope as life unfolds, we all lean into it a bit more and enjoy the small wins and the big challenges. More life.
Along the lines of sharing your full truth...  Can you drop the lip combo because Sis!!! Your lip gloss is poppin’ and inquiring minds want to know.
❤️
💕💕💕
Hi Patricia, been a follower for such a long time. I’m talking about primark haul days. Anyway, this video is so motivating in a way that it showcases real reality for women and id like to applaud you for this. I feel like I’ve grown so much watching your videos and seeing even just a fraction of your life teaches me so much.  Best wishes and keep doing you and being real 💗 mwa xxx
The rest of 2020 will be amazing IJN Amen 🙏🏾❤️❤️
Pick up the word Patricia. You will find so much contentment love❤️ Be safe out here guys!
Thanks for sharing this Patrica. I know it’s a big step! Looking forward to your new videos. Hoping 2020 ends on a high for us all 😭 x
I see you already, Authentic Lovely Funny Patricia ❤️ Can't wait to see more of you - take care x
❤️
💕
Patricia , you guys will be fine by his grace 🙏🏾 we are all going through a phase this 2020 , it’s not been easy but we strive . Much love ❤️
I’m so happy to hear that you and the rest of your family have been able to push through it and are working on things
Love, don’t share your marriage, please. We love you both and know the dangers on social media on marriages. Maybe once a month but don’t vlog it. Tooo many divorces have occurred because of this. You are loved Patty!
do you, for you 💖
i love how transparent you are! will be keeping you in my prayers! and its okay to not always have it together!
This year has been just one think after another but this to shall pass!  We have to press forward, love and uplift ourselves as well as each other!
Hi Patricia, yes it’s only normal to clash with your husband. I think is not just the quarantine pressure but also with dealing with baby’s skin issues. Don’t worry it’s a phase that will pass. Marriage is like that so please stay positive with your husband. Easier said than done but we all experience it from time to time.
'You're gonna have to lean into your fears whether you like it or not because tomorrow is not promised' AMEN
Your last name is not Bright...🤯😆
I love that Patricia doesn’t make me feel bad about myself she’s the best
Your healing comes from within you can fix yourself.
I got pregnant this year, lost my baby at 24 weeks this year. Went through depression and now feeling better but this year as you say has been fucking shit.
I thought Bright was your last name lol
Appreciate the transparency. We love you!!!! Hope you’re okay 💘
So relateable.
Patricia what you’re going through it’s call life and things do change. I feel exactly like you when it comes to my body, I use to have that hourglass figure and, now I’ve lost, it the shape is still there but all of my muscles are gone, my a$$ is flat as a board, my daughter sometimes call me pancake. She did buy me a mat and some weights. We do have to be very careful what we say because it will come to pass, take it from me. Find a way to get Patricia back and allow your husband get to know her. You are beautiful, smart and funny as hell. Hang in there sis you’re going to be fine. This covid has done a lot of damage to families so please stay strong and if you have to scream sometimes do so, but don’t wake the baby.
Just be strong you a so amazing
❤️❤️
Your amazing xxxx
Sending you so much love 💓
I still can’t believe you gave birth at home 🤣😅
Just wanted to say your makeup is beautiful. I’m loving the orange tones on your skin 🔥
Bring it on Bright! 😁 I think we’re all ready for change!
This year has been really rough and everybody's feeling it. Love you no matter what Patricia. Here trying to extend the same love and patience to myself. 💕
Patricia, I've been following you for the past six-seven years and it has been such a gift being a part of your journey. It's been a blessing to have such an amazing, strong, black woman as a reference and as a model. I've been happy to celebrate your successes and cry with you through your hardest moments that you've shared with us.   Just want to let you know that you are not alone! I too, and I suppose many of us, have struggled with mental health issues and those have gotten worse with the pandemic and lockdown. Thank you so much for being vulnerable and sharing your journey with us, it makes so many of us feel less alone.  Whatever you choose to do from now on, whether you choose to share more or start sharing more and decide to share less, just know that you'll always have a supporter in me. I'm rooting for you girl! You are so beautiful and amazing and you make such a huge impact in the live of so many, never forget that! Don't forge that God is with you and loves you and He is singing over you with joyful songs. Trust in Him and take good care of yourself! Maybe consider some therapy? I know that has really helped me deal with my issues in the past.   Love you, Patricia! Keep going girl, you are awesome!
Omg I thought she was going to say her and Mike broke up 😭😭😭 The two of them along with Jamie+Nikki were my *ALL TIME FAVORITE* YouTube couples, and their split hit hard lol. If Patricia and Mike split...I'm done 😅
♥️♥️♥️ Sendung you lots of love ♥️♥️♥️
Thank you so much for sharing ❤️ this helped me a lot
Thank god I've found your channel i love you. Keep your spirit up we will get this together
You’ve been consistently putting out fire content throughout one of the hardest periods that anyone can go through. Depression is at an all time high for everyone, but you’re a mom, wife and girl-boss among many other things. You’re doing great but it’s also okay to not be happy for a while. I love this vulnerability because it helps us too. To maybe acknowledge just how hard this year has really been. And maybe seeking professional help because you know how black women are stigmatized that we’re just expected to be strong and keep pushing all the time.
In order to get to the better, sometimes you have to go through the worse.    Hang on in there the lights will switch on and you will see the road ahead. ❤️🙏🏾
ily so much patricia 😭🥺
sending you love mama 🌞 rays of unconditional love 🦋
Freakin' love you and I feel like I can actually learn from you, take good care of yourself and lots of love from Holland ❤
This has been a ROUGH year!!! Probably the worst year for many people!!!! It’s so important in times like this to make sure we take care of our own physical and mental health!  I respect you so much for being open and real about what you’ve been experiencing!!! Sending you lots of love, support and prayers!!!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🥰🥰🥰
Aww.. Patricia thank you so much for your honesty, I felt depressed too but I got myself back up. Stay strong and God bless.  I love you more 👍🏼💯😘 Ps: your body is Fabulous Girl!!
This is honestly one of your best videos. I know this would’ve been so so difficult for you. Thank you for being so honest with us and I really wish u and your hubby well with your journey patching things back ♥️💕
Sending love Patricia x
You are strong Patricia but you don’t have to be strong all the time. Thanks for sharing.
Even though it's seems so difficult right now, for every uncomfortable situation you are going through, God/Creator is teaching you something. This is year is just terrible but don't let it take you down, send you lots of love 🥰🥰🥰🥰
“the mind and the body be doin too much, TOO MUCH!” girlllll i felt!! thank you for reminding us we’re not alone
Sending so much love Patricia 😚 I resonate with a lot of what you said, and it is time all of us start putting ourselves first 💜  I cannot wait to see the rest of your journey 🌟
Please do not share your personal relationship with the media...Remember GOD is in control of your life...not people.
Thank you for your honesty. Please take all time you need to work on yourself and your family. I’ll keep you in my prayers ❤️
I thought she was pregnant
I love this and you thank you for sharing this and inspiring us woman all around the world. You know what if you’re ever in LA please let me know😂 we need to be friends
This is the honest, open Patricia I admired all those years back when I was watching your work wear videos to get inspiration for work outfits. I truly admire your honesty in this. It was so refreshing to watch and I'm sure it has been helpful for a lot of us who have been constantly struggling this year! Thank you so much for being so open. I'm now looking even more forward to continue to watch your journey xxx
Just remember you are somebody's goals.
👁👄👁 your surname isn’t BRIGHT??!!!.......That is the biggest shock for me this year 😂😂. Love you babes 😘 I’m here for it all good or bad!
🥺🥺🥺 the video just started and I’m reading thru the comments.. but what ever you’re about to say I love you and Michael and I just wish you both the best. Pray pray pray.
That's why people love you 👍
This came at a perfect time because I have been quite depressed for some few months now heightened by Corona of course.
I am married for 13 years.  I’m sorry you are dealing with issues around the quarantine.  We are over here in our little 4 person cocoon (mom dad son daughter) and wishing we could keep it pretty much like this.This quarantine kept us together in the house which we used to make good food, sleep in super late, relaxing in different ways, etc.  I think social media is mixed up with real life and try to focus on living your real life.  I realize that you have to work,but life shouldn’t be filled with the superficial. Focus on beauty, babies and family focused things but you don’t have to give up your private life to rock this (take a page of outta the chic naturals playbook) she’s an enigma!  Your body issues are another thing that an attitude/ perspective adjustment could help you said it here...” love the body you have when you have it.”  Focus on being physically fit/ healthy, strong, flexible...instead of chasing some aesthetic goal.   I’m over weight so my family gets physical activity in at least once a day, we are eating LESS.  Your journey continues.
Depression is real. A lot of people deny it and some tell you it doesn't exist. Have been battling it on and off. This lockdown does not do favours for anyone whether depressed on not. We really need to take care of ourselves because without that things will only get worse.
Hello Patricia, I am super happy that you came with this video. We, as women, struggle sometimes. Whatever it is, our relationship, our bodies, work, being a good partner and the list is looooong. We are in need(or I am in need) in this kind of videos. Because it’s ok to show your feelings... I can not wait to follow your journey, and just know you are not alone we are all together !
Lovely watch and listen.  The sharing and openness is fine if you’d fill satisfied doing that but please know that you don’t owe anyone
Your Authenticity is shining through Patricia  🖤
Why should you be more open. I think people should keep a lot of their lives private because it isn't really any body else's business. I never discuss my personal life at work because it leaves you vulnerable. People will judge and have an opinion long after you have got over it. I think you feel you owe it to people because you are on social media but we all have are own lives and our own journeys añd whilst it's good to have support by sharing, once the information is out there it is out there. You don't owe anybody who watches you anything. You are watched because you are liked. Don't feel obliged to expose everything.
Great update love how honest you are, hope the rest of this year is much much better for everybody ❤️
Patricia! Thank you so much for your honesty, even though you didn't need to. I will have ur back no matter what! You are an inspiration, even though you may not feel like one at this particular time. Lots of love heading your way! God bless you and the family x Hope you are feeling better x
Wishing you all the strength and happiness! This year has been so hard on everyone and I am praying and hoping the things will get better. 💞
I had a baby beginning of this year and my emotions are just all over the place and this pandemic has made it harder.
Im here for this such a real one🤎goddess the honesty is refreshing💫💪🏾
I'm ready for the new chapter Patricia! This year has been a difficult one for me as well and im sure for MOST of us... and we either let it sink us or we learn what we need to learn, let go what we need to let go and start to take our time to step into our true and best selves for the coming year and onwards. Like you, no more. its almost a new month and its time to step back into the light.
Patricia you are a strong woman and I admire you a great deal and yes, 2020 has been a challenging year for us all but we‘d all get through it. I am pleased that you have identified issues that needs to be deal with, recognising these issues is the first step towards solving/fixing them. Go girl, God is with you and we love 💖 💕 you lots!
❤ ❤ ❤
Thanks for sharing Pat. Trust, this too shall pass. Praying for you and Mike to iron out the little knots, nothing your facing now is greater than the love and life you’ve built. These single streets are...#lol
Wow this video you have touch based on things a lot of us are going through and I can really relate. Doing check ins on ourselves and looking after our mental health is so key. I just rate you cause I can’t imagine how it’s like to give to the public and deal with issues at the same time. Once again thanks for being your authentic self as usual.
Thank you so much Patricia for your honesty ! I discovered your channel in quarantine and oh my god, I have laughed so so much thanks to you and your amazing personality, please please please never change you are one of a kind ✨
Thanks alot for this cos this show me am not going through this alone its how am feeling most of the time am very very  depressed most of the time and I hide it alot thnks Patricia
Omg! I wonder if you are a fellow Aquarius... because... literally have felt the exact same and I’ve just been researching and looking deeper within myself. But yeah my emotions have been all of the place and just in a constant state of questioning myself with Everything. It’s been trying times but through honesty and unity we will all get through this ❤️❤️❤️ xxx
We are praying with you
Wow it’s so nice to see that there’s people out here feeling the same way I feel. Having to be strong all the time can be exhausting and it is!!! Timing is everything and I feel like you posted this at the perfect time for me and for yourself of course ✨ I’m glad you have a positive mindset and a great head in your shoulders! That’s where I’m at. I’m putting myself and my emotions FIRST. 💝 we have to take care of our hearts.
You'll get through this. One thing we love about you is you're always real to the core. By the time you figure things out you're open about it and work on it. No one out there believes anybody has a perfect life. You're not alone 🙏🏾 & you're right, marriage is private. No one needs to judge your relationship without even knowing the both of you. So we take what you share but it's family and it comes first so under wraps to make it work is good.
Appreciate your transparency, boo! It's been heavy for many of us, and I'm happy to see you working through it!
💞💞💞💞💞
Life is a blessing. Cherish everyday guys💕
Yes ma'am this year has been a whole lotta lotta. For me it's been challenging personally, professionally and socially.  Thank you for always being relatable, vulnerable and transparent. You look beautiful Patricia!
💞💞💞💞💞💞
Take care of yourself .. I knew someone who had it and many around her criticised her behaviour not knowing what was really happening..it was a friend that brought a therapist over to her house and she was diagnosed.
Hey Patricia, not sure if you'll see this but I am praying for you. From experience, I say this as I know you are a Christian, God is the only person that can solve those fears and anxieties, pray pray and pray some more that you cast all of your cares to him because he will heal you individually and as couple. GOD BLESS YOU HUN!! ❤️
♥️♥️♥️
I know y'all better not divorce,Cause after Jamie&Nikki I'm truly ready to throw youtube in the garbage disposal.😣
wherever u go, I'll be right there.......together we are strong! You've taught me a lot.
Sooooo what IS your surname?👀
Keep going girl, you are amazing! Been watching you for years!
I think you're so brave for sharing, I really look up to you and you being so honest is so helpful because its real ❤
YES SIS, can't wait for the next chapter!
This year has been hard. I’ve been dealing with a lot of situational depression. My family and my future goals just keep me moving even though I definitely want to give up.
Fully agree 🥺. Also, where did you get that top? It's so pretty 🤩
Been watching you dear 3yr now opened my own channel pray for me it grows 🙏🙏
Sending love Patricia ❤
I love your dress, I remember it from one of your hauls. Love it! You look beautiful! 😘
I love this and thank you for being so real. I made the decision that after children, I will have a Mommy Makeover. I will definitely get a breast augmentation because breastfeeding really changes your body. I will get other procedures as well. It is a confidence thing and not about vanity at all.   Here’s to you Patricia for being real and open with us. 💗
2020 for me SO FAR has been my most blessed year ever,not financially or anything but because although I have been on the front line  facing COVID head on,I am still healthy and testing negative,for that I am eternally grateful
Hope your baby is fine now, pray for her 💓💝🌹💐and her health and your family
All I wanted to do when she was talking was give her a hug and a squeeze and ask shall I put the kettle on. You got this Patricia and you have people around you that has you, lean into them and speak your feelings always. I am happy you feel confident expressing more here but also know it’s not something you have to give whenever you don’t want to. Always got your back queen! X 🤎
this year, i've been dusty. lol...next year hopefully all areas of my life will be a glow up.... im currently working on getting certified so that i can be in the six figures level career wise.
I love your honesty and reflection about how you’ve been feeling and are growing. 🤎
Thank you for sharing your life with us. You're so real and honest and your vulnerability only makes you more of inspiration. Praying for you and your family!
Thank you for sharing Patty ❤️. Love and light 🌸.
Thank you for this <3
Thank you for sharing!! Your openness about things like depression and body image do more good than you could even know!! Love always 💕
Showing vulnerability is strength 💕
I remember I started watching since before you got engaged...it's been a while babes
Who didn’t ever bother her name is not Bright?? We love you no matter what surname you present yourself:)
I can relate to you some what Patricia. I've been in roller coaster of emotions. This year i put my work first and not myself. But my faith has kept me 💯
Oh man.. Pat u are the REALIST WE LOVE YOU.,.hang in there mama,fight for LOVE,n remember you are very LOVED💘💝🖤👍🏼✊🏽👏🏽🤜🏽
Appreciate your honesty..but certain aspects of your personal life...should remain that way!...Personal...You know where the line is also ..I must say you stand out as a YouTube personality, not just because of your looks and  gift to gab...You are f#@&ing Smart!...Unfortunately, It's been a rough year for most of us...So hang in there girlfriend...You're doing just fine!👍💞
Patients is a virtue, sometimes no reaction is better than making things worse. Don't let PMDD OCD obsessive thoughts or any mental health issues overcome you. Seek the creator with patience and when you loose communication with your spouse, remember you was married with the creator, its a triangle so the only way to meet is through God. Find a spiritual Physical balance in life and remain humble.
Love you so much Patricia! Thank you for your honesty and sharing your truth. Rooting for you and Mike always <3
Thank you sooo much for sharing this Patricia!! I really respect you for being so honest and transparent ❤️
Thank you Patricia. You’re leading the way and normalizing transparency. LIFE HAPPENS!! Happy that you feel supported enough to share here <3
I love when she said 'if she doesn't laugh, she will end up crying' thats me!...I also think that we forget to be grateful most of the time and one thing I do now is to be grateful for how far I have come. Love you Patricia, sending you love.
Sending lots of love your way Patrica ❤...Let's all get through 2020 alive...Cuz whew chile thee absolute ghetto. 🤕😭
I've always appreciated the one on one sit down chats. Its one of the main reason I started following you all those years ago, because I  feel like I can relate to you in so many ways. You're a phenomenal woman, through weakness and strengths you power through and it's truly inspirational. You and Mike are  amazing as well and through God's grace I believe things will get better. Just keep being true to you. Your supporters are here. 💪❤🙏
Thank you for your transparency because this couldn't have been easy to express to us. I'm rooting for you and Magic Mike. 🙏🏾
Thanks Patricia! This video and topics were extremely needed for me. Thanks for sharing your personal life and fears!! I feel the same.. Love 💘 love you!!
Hi Patricia  I had the same condition and I had abdominoplasty and it was the best thing I ever did. It corrected the umbilical hernia and the gap in the muscle. I have been watching your journey since before you got married and I have been married 20 years.  Commitment to God and each other helps a lot.  Hanging in there and thank you for sharing and inspiring. You are so relatable.  And you let us all know it is all going to be ok.
Thank you for your vulnerability. ❤️
We all experience so many struggles... Therefore I appreciate the strength as well as the vunlerability you show in this video!  I've been following you for years and I love you.. Sending you sooo much love <3 <3 <3
Am I the only one who thinks the gaia dresses are ugly. Because it's like trending now everyone's wearing it but ... Yeah definitely not my cup of tea.
Patricia you look great. The new normal is a adjustment keep strong for you an yr family
Videos like this remind me of the best of this platform. A place where we can see people who look and sound like us in similar life circumstances. Thank you for being vulnerable with us Patricia. I pray for peace for you and your family during this period.
Hi Patricia. I really appreciate your candor and openness with us even though you don't owe it to any of us. In addition to the things that you mentioned to take care of yourself, I would also recommend some sort of emotional therapy/counseling. There's so much in your life and we can't process it alone. And while we are hear to listen to you, sometimes you need a professional to give you that outside perspective. To talk about your marriage, motherhood, insecurities, and anything else that is weighing on your heart. Life is hard. Period. But we deserve to be full and whole in the process. Sending love and hugs.
We ❤️ you Patricia!
Patricia you’re such a STRONG WOMAN!💪 I always look up to you. You will go through it. This times are really really hard for a lot of people, and this year hasn’t been easy. But we’ll make the best of the rest🙌 definitely looking forward to the next video!❤️
We love you Patricia. We here for the journey.
Cast all your burden to God, He walks with you!🙏🏾
I honestly thought your surname was Bright😂 So excited for all that's to come💪🏾✨
Love you patricia. I've been watching you for years! You're honestly someone I look up to so much. I'm happy that you're choosing to take charge and change the things you dont like. Sending love and light xx
2020 SUCKS BIG TIME  🥴 Having babies totally wrecks your body.. I've had 4. A lot of us women have body dysmorphia frfr!  You are not alone.
I remember when you had that "hand thing" for months!!!!! I think you were pregnant too
Im happy to see this video, the patricia I started to watch almost 10 years ago was always positive but admitted flows and ''imperfections'' and watching the vlog gave me so much confidence, I saw those imperfections as perfection because it makes someone person and charm. The Patricia I saw in recent vlogs just show a perfect life/ body and Im thinking ok, great nothing special compared to other vlogers ,good for her. Don't get me wrong, following Patricia since the beginning, Im so happy and inspired by her sucess but we all know what real life is and though vlogers don't have to show all their personal business ( I wouldn't care that she decides to stop showing kids/husband even the family vlog is lovely,I would totally get it.) But I want to see the real Patricia, the one that inspired me as a you g woman, I'm the same age and kind of ''grew upon watching the vlog. I always like the energy, humor, I cannot wait to see the next vlogs
Honestly grateful for this year.. left a very abusive and toxic marriage and couldn’t be thankful for Covid 19. I am in a much more better place mentally. So greatful to God
Can I just say Patricia, you deserve a damehood for The Break Platform. Like who else is educating this generation? Financial Times could never. God bless you.
❤️ ❤️ ❤️❤️
It's gonna be okay. ♥
Praying for you & your family!!! Looking forward to your new content! 💖💖
Love the transparency Patricia 💗 I'm sending you all the love and strength
❤️❤️❤️ I love that you are so open and honest!  One of the reasons I watch and subscribe to your channel is you’re always authentically yourself or you may not share everything but you’re always just genuinely you.. love you Patricia!!
WE LOVE YOU PATRICIA!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
God is trying us this year and honestly you're not the only that is going through this but I know He has a plan and all we can do is continue in prayer and consult Him more. Thank you for being so transparent even if it is scary.
I love your transparency ❤️
Pray Pray Pray. God has us all covered. Don't let the devil come between you and your husband. God is the beginning and the end. The devil do not like to see happy families.
WOW!!! Thanks for being so vulnerable and honest with us. We get it. We all have been going through stuff and this connects us even more to you. Thank you. Woman to woman we love you. Do what you gotta do and we will all be here to share and support you in your authenticity. That's what us women should do for each other.
I’m so happy you share. We build these walls up and being a public figure people want to pigeon hole and put you in a box. I am a huge fan and can’t wait to see what else you create just everything that makes you happy and to ignite a new flame of light and inspiration for yourself and your fans. I’m here for it girl 💕
I m so ready for you being imperfect ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Thank you for sharing! I just want you to know you are not alone! Having a 2nd baby and maintaining relationships and a healthy sense of self is hard under normal circumstances but during a pandemic...so tough.  Sending love and support from Seattle :)
Patricia, you are so brave to share this with us. I truly believe that you will work through this and come out stronger on the other side. You and your family will be stronger. Keeping you in my prayers.
Well done you. And Eff those 15 people who have thumbed this down in the first 40 minutes of this video being up!!!
I know this is a serious discussion but the short Bob really suits your face shape .
Thank you Patricia, for simply having the courage to be you. You still look great! And if you didn't know already you are a great source of support to us all. Love what you did with the voluptuous vase
Sending love and light your way. You’ve got this 💕
Many  ❤❤❤ to you and your lovely family from Rome ..
Sending you love! You look beautiful always. We are here because we care about you. Much love!
Thank you so much for sharing! ❤️
Patricia I love you and your content so much. You are so inspiring. Young, black and on your shit! In appreciate your candidness here. Life can be shit and it’s so important to know that you aren’t alone. This cloud will pass and the sun is just waiting for us all to walk into the sunshine. Sending love and light all the way from the US ❤️
Hi,  I just read a article about iron deficiency, but especially ferritin deficiency related to depression after birth.  If you go and check your iron levels, make sure to ask for them to also check the ferritin! It could be that those levels are very low and that can cause these types of symptoms.   ❤️
I actually thought your last name was Bright 😂
The way you spoke about these issues shows how much of a strong person you are x
Wow when you almost cried in the beginning I felt that. I've been insecure about my body for a very long time time and still am. Thank you for sharing your truth. 🙏🏾
I lowkey suspected your surname wasn't actually Bright but now that you've said it out loud my nosy self wants to know what it actually is!😂
Hey Patricia, I have been following you for years and I've always thought you are so awesome and transparent and always staying true to yourself. I even bought your 'the break' course. This is probably my first time commenting lol but it makes my very excited for you that you are embarking on this new journey. You're super brave. Thanks for always making me laugh so hard. A big hug from Belgium!
It's been a lot! Everything has been tough n the added stresses of having your wee one will be so much extra on top of pandemic stress! Take care xx
❤❤❤❤❤
But sweetie, you still look amazing after having two children.!
Your medical condition requires surgical intervention so done feel like you owe anyone an explanation for your abdominoplasty. Do what you need to do to take care of you .
I’ve loved you from britpopprincess days. You have always been my bestie in my head. We grew up together and your evolution continues to inspire ❤️
Sending you love 💕💕💕💕 good book recommendation the game of life and how to play it. I won't say much about it but hope it helps you as it has helped me
We love the realness ❤️
You've helped pull me through some tough times. You and your husband will always be best friends. Don't waste a day on fear, anger, or regret.
Pat, the grownups among us realize relationships are work. It's clear that you and Mike are committed and we're rooting for you guys. Thanks for being transparent, but know that it's OKAY to keep some things for yourself. Blessings. ❤
I think that is what 2020 has taught us all - we can’t keep faking our way through life. We have to live authentically. I look forward to seeing the new content!
Loved this. I’m looking forward to the new and different content!
love your honesty so much...love you!!!❤❤❤❤
Praying for you Patricia. Praying for strength, for guidance, for confidence, for true joy and peace in yourself and your marriage. Lean on God always, seek Him and all things will be added to you (Matthew 6:33)
Tchaiii Patricia...wetin be your surname then? Ewoo! But we still love you..take care of yourself first them you can care for others..💕
I feel exactly the same about quarantine affecting the mental health 😩 It's so hard when everything is on pause and you can't be yourself for so long 😔 But I'm so excited that you want to look after yourself more and share it with us ❤ Can't wait until everything is back to normal
PREACH! And I still love you for just being human 💜
Love you Patricia!♥️
Praying for you and Mike 🙏🏽 May God keep you both
you look great here
❤️❤️❤️ Sending love your way. Wish your family peace and happiness.
This video couldn’t have come at a more pivotal time in my life. I feel like I’m at that point in my relationship where all I do is care for my s/o and what makes him feel better and keeps him happy especially while he deals with his depression, anxiety, etc. but over the last few months I seem to have lost myself and it’s time I get back to that. I’m tired of caring for others and not making sure I am okay, because I’m reality I’m not. I’m really glad you opened up and are doing better, I’ve been following you since forever ago even before you and Michael got married when you were talking about meeting him while he worked security at the club lol. I love seeing your growth over the years, much love Pat ❤️ I wish nothing but happiness for you and your family especially during this crazy ass pandemic
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ LOVE THIS , LOVE YOU !   Girl all these quarantines just about tore my relationship in half too 🤷🏽‍♀️ ITS A STRUGGLE 😂
How can you not love this gem of a lady! 💝💝
You are so strong for sharing and letting us in on your struggles❣️ Nobody is perfect, it will all work out Patricia, just take it one step at a time, sending you lots of love😘
💚💚💚
Love that top, where can I purchase it?
The biggest lie in history, the virus is a hoax, check out DR Vernon Coleman, one of many, many others, wake up people!
Thank you for sharing this Patricia. We are more brave because of it. We support you every step of the way ❤.
Patricia you are so beautiful in and out! I truly appreciate your honesty.
Loved this realness Patricia! We welcome all changes you bring!
I appreciate this and I know it was hard for her to make this video very proud ❤️
Awww.....Thank you so much Patricia. I love all you were able to share now and all you plan to share too. We are here for the real Patricia Bright so be you and the world will adjust
It's so nice to see that people on social media are just normal people that have ups and downs instead of this facade that sometimes makes me think that I'm the only one that is struggling
Awww Patricia you look great now. I hope you find happiness, and contentment with yourself. God bless you and your family.
I was just watching the Paris vlog for the  iiiin time , because I can't go there so I am living through you
Every woman and every man goes through some rough and challenging times in our lifetime,  I admire your strength to come out and say this things about you. I wish I had the courage to do the same. Most women hides under this persona that we create for ourselves to feel accepted or be like other people. I can't wait to see what's next for you!!
This year has been very draining for us especially us women 💛💛💛
Speaking to my soul, Pat. I have 2 kids under 5 and am watching this on my stationary bike because I, too, have had the same epiphanies you shared. Same relationship struggles. Same physical struggles. Preach!
Thank you for sharing this Patricia! Love you even more for it❤
Patricia I just want to say I am so proud of you. I appreciate your ability to be straight forward and honest about all topics. Especially about body image postpartum. So many women will hide their pregnancy and just show the result after they have reached their weight loss goals. That is great and all but it isn't relatable when a huge part of the story is missing. The pregnancy and postpartum experience is part of the journey of adjusting to a new lifestyle and balancing family life and your own personal goals.   In regards to your vlogging channel I loved seeing you and Michael and Grace. I understand the awkwardness of sharing too much of your relationship though so understand that we respect that. Quarantine is a struggle especially with children but we gonna make it through! Work on you and your family. I stay rooting for you and Michael y'all are so cute together.   Also you look absolutely great! I know you are entitled to feel the way you feel about your own body but sometimes we can be so critical of ourselves. You have slayed prebaby, during pregnancy, and now. You are beautiful inside and out.
Thank you for being here xxxx
We love you because you are you ❗️❗️not because you are perfect ❤️❤️
Are you done with having kids? Would having another kid destroy your future corrective stomach surgeries?
Wow I can definitely relate. This year has been HARD. 2020 is definitely the year of seeing things clearly. It’s good to see someone with a large platform be so honest. Glad you are so self aware and focusing on healing. Praying for you Patricia! 💕🙏🏾
So proud of you for your vulnerability and sharing your truth. You are an inspiration in so many ways but most of all...you're human! We love you boo and will continue to support you on your journey. Wherever it may lead. ❤️
This is so inspiring! thank you Patricia
Are you changing content because YT asked you to???
We love you Patricia! Thank you allowing us to see into your life. I've been a subscriber for years, and you have always inspired me to go after whatever it is that I want, and to do so unapologetically. 2020 has been a hard year, and quarantining has made it even harder. We're all in this together <3
Je t’aime 💕 Patricia !!
Hands down, my favorite video of yours. Thank you!
💛💛💛
❤️❤️🙏🏽
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Right I’m about to write an essay so bare with me, but I want to say THANK YOU Patricia. Literally so much of what you said resonated with me, I had my first baby a year ago, and I believe I have been in denial about PPD. Mental health after a baby is not linear, however much time passes, it is up and down. You literally have to find your identity again, and you never find the person you were before you find someone new, it is hard to adjust. Also what you said about the toll quarantine takes on your relationship...listen I have had some mammoth arguments lol, and I am the happy go lucky type too. Thankyou for being so real, and using your platform in this way. As mothers it’s so easy to forget about ourselves. And if you want to do something that makes you happy - then do it, as you said 2020 is showing us how life is short, so who cares what anyone else thinks. And anyone hating their body right now, please love it, because I feel exactly how Pat said, I look at so many past pictures of myself and can not fathom how I use to dislike my body in any way. As a long time subscriber I appreciate how real you’ve just been, about being a woman, motherhood and 2020 in general. This shit is hard!
Keep being you :)  Real life and the realities of certain stuff just come up and we have to deal with it the best we can. Also, the lockdown/ pandemic has definitely revealed so much about people we have around us and due to the usual dynamics we had, we didn't see certain stuff - an eye opener and ensuring that those of us evolved, make changes wherever needed.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Patricia 💖💖💖
You say you're not strong but, this video was such a brave thing to do! There's no point striving for perfection anyway- it has too many different ideals/perceptions. You're a strong and loving mummy, anyone that watches your videos and hears the way you talk about your babies can tell that! I can't wait to see more videos keeping it real :)
You are very brave and such a positive person! It’s ok to be weak sometimes.
If only you knew how you lighten up my mood whenever I watch you😍😍❤️I have learnt to even embrace my flaws because of you💞💕🇧🇼
Just want to let you know, I love you, I appreciate you, I look up to you and I’m praying for all the good and strength because we all know this year has been testing us in a lot of ways!
Much love Patricia, it's been hard but as you recognise this is also a chance for growth. Always love a khalil gibran quote "your pain is the cracking of the shell that encloses your understanding" you are so young and yet so accomplished, cut yourself some slack. Hugs from north of the river
Love you Pat it has been a challenging year to say the least However we will get through it by Gods Grace take care of you and keeping doing what you are doing you are an inspiration do what makes you happy
Let's be clear Patricia!!! You are Beautiful 🥰⚘ ......Ms. Spoon
Love you and your complete honesty. Think we can all agree that this year has been the worst. Its horrible seeing what is going on around the world. But having to deal with things at home too can be so difficult to juggle and can take a lot out of us. Take some time away from YouTube and social media if you want to to focus on yourself, your children and your husband. We are not going anywhere. I'm still living a lockdown life as I'm caring for a family member.  So I'm definitely not going anywhere lol.
Thank you  Patricia you always try your best to keep it 100 and I appreciate that!! You really  Ripped  yourself open, I have to applaud you for your candor and your honesty I nothing but  Love  for you  ... no matter how imperfect we all are
Patricia, you have overcome and achieved a hell of a lot this year though...from having a baby to creating a ton of content and new channels, you have given it 100%.  Funny thing about relationships during lockdown is that we tend to treat our partners like employees...we expect them to step up and over but they can’t keep up. Plus they think “lockdown, more time with my wife”, we think “lockdown need to crack on with work mate!”...In other words, we go into fight mode, they go into flight mode...!  All the help we would normally get just hasn’t been available...so my lovely, keep working things through, you have both had a traumatic 8/9 months, but now you can pull in more support with the children and work, you can reconnect and climb higher heights together 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽  Patricia Bright is a great name as it suits your persona 100% Love it!!!  Get your abdomen fixed if you want to but over what you look like, the most important thing is your health.xxx Tia Mowry Hardrict took her time to get her body back, and she gained even more followers on social media because every day women could relate.x  Also, your African genes have everything to do with how your body evolves after each pregnancy. I think you look super healthy at this weight and size and this is what makes you still wholesome and beautifully you😘💝💐
beautiful x
Thank you for your truth and honesty Patrica. I would really love to hear you talk more about GOD and your salvation and prayer and what it has done for you. I know you are a believer. And thank you 🙏🏽 for being honey. I hope this is something you can consider. I love you
You are beautiful and amazing inside and out and we support you fully always!
You are gorgeous, and I look forward to your new transformations!! God Bless you, are an inspiration!!❤😍🙏🏽
Loving the transparency
God bless your family Patricia. I know both you and your husband are believers of God. I remember that in the past you talked about religion. I pray for you two.
Wow, it feels like you are talking about me. Had postnatal depression after both my girls. I don’t look after myself and I hide so much behind a “strong” facade. You’re amazing Patricia. I admire you so much.
We're real women and I love how real you are with us 💜
It's called life, never give up keep trusting in God for everything. We all struggle none of us are prefect but perfectly human and with that comes resilience.  Life is a journey.
Love you, Patricia! ♥️
Thank you for being so real!
Patricia, you’re amazing and you continue to inspire me. Sending you light, love and prayer. ❤️
She just keeps it real, doesn't she 😍😍😍
