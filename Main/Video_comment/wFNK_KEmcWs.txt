This movie looks terrible.
This movie trailer gets goose bumps on the skin This is like the beginning of Mortal kombat 2021 movie when Sub Zero goes on a hunting trip with the intention of destroying Cole Young out of the way!!! 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
This is why I don't read comments.
if garbage had a name
Worst movie
my brother loves ghostbusters we are about to play it in real life and he saw this trailer on youtube
Ok what SCP Class would they Classify Garraka.
I thought he said my fear itself lol 😂 1:21
What a disappointment this movie was, eh?

What happened to the acid in your stomach? Will it harden up? 😨 Because I would not like that. I'll keep my  acid  in my stomach. Thank you very much
What the hell is this crap.. ... Defecating on the legacy of the original... Not even a gint of Afterlife.. total disrespect milking the turnip for all of uts blood
I'll tell you what was that your worst demise

"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire - Official Teaser Trailer Tonight I'm watching this. I have this on Blu-ray. It looks pretty cheesy, campy, corny, quirky & nostalgic. I really love these movies soo much. Great cast. It looks like It has great Special Effects & lots of fun to watch......SSSSSSS.....
I love Ghostbusters been a fan since the 80s movies, this trailer is just awsome and reawakens the 8 year old child in me again that excitement i had as a nipper watching the originals at home on vhs, the way it all freezes up to the GB headquarters then It all falls silent.... black screen.... a v8 firing up....then cutting straight to the Ecto1 doing that spin burnout combined with the trademark siren, just awsome and in the words of Winston "NY what a town!"
Love how finn wolfhard is in this movie
Huuuuuuuuuhhhhhhh gararraka is not a original monster
Where to watch this for free ??

Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is nominated for Favorite Movie at the 2024 Kids Choice Awards. Thumbs up if you're voting for it and you want it to win.
hi ghostbusters 3
Their back!!!!!!!!!!!!
Put a chick in it… make it lame and gay
I see a comment "And so Ghostbusters face their greatest foe: Old man winter" I replied "Yeah, Abe Simpson in the mister plow advert. He's old and he needs to lie down, do not get in the way of an old man in that position. They will move heaven and earth itself to make it to the couch and take a nap" .
i'm disappointed that a few scenes here are not in the actual movie!
Sempre più cattivi😆
Very boring, terrible trailer
The movie stuck to its theme. It was definitely not fire unlike the trailer
Daoraaaaa!
Filme top, assiste hoje no cinema, que nostalgia que sente com a volta desse clássico.
This is such a good movie!
Shimo has arrived
I watched the movie and here are my issues: 1. Scenes are incredibly short and dialogue light to help the TikTok kids keep their attention on the movie due to their short attention spans.  2. Movie is incredibly short paced.  3. Characters were suddenly extremely important even though they were only on screen for seconds.  4. No new lore gets explained, viewers are just supposed to accept it.  5. The villain, while original, is on screen for a maximum of 10 minutes, gets defeated immediately and offers no real problem.  6. Too many main characters with their own plot line.  7. Cast is WAY too big.  8. Winston Zeddemore suddenly has a secret laboratory in an abandoned aquarium where other people research the paranormal which has every single plot important device conveniently just laying around for characters to realize, hey, this thing can conveniently save our behinds. How convenient.  9. My god, this movie was just a mess. They should have let the Ghostbusters stay in the Reitman family. Afterlife was amazing.  10. My conclusion: It‘s not as bad as 2016 (which we will ignore ever happened) but it doesn‘t come close to Afterlife/Legacy let along the originals. It places on place 4 out of 5 on the ranking: #1 Ghostbusters, #2 Ghostbusters 2, #3 Afterlife/Legacy, #4 Frozen Empire, #5 2016 (did not happen)
this is definitely one of the movies of all time
I have no background with GhostBusters. Can i still watch the movie? Or i wont understand things?
Acho que tem que pagar pra assistir filmes e séries galera... Não dá pra ser pirata mais, Eles solta o assogueiro!
Rally really good movie! Brought back memories! I loved it!
I am seeing this tomorrow.  I am so excited!
Was awesome. Only wish Rick Moranis was in it
Just seen the film last night. Trying to think of something positive to say but I've pretty much forgotten it all. I came away with a sense of not really seeing very much. I might have to re-visit, maybe I was having an off day because the trailer looks better.
Just woke 😊😊😊😊
Just saw this last night in theatres and I enjoyed it! It was a fun movie that paid homage to the past but also is building a path for the new generation.
omggg
It is a good movie ir not?
Ghostbusters forever
Yeah Ghostbusters and Midnight ghost hunt should colab
Just got out of the theater.  Kinda stupid. I almost fell asleep a few times.
Busting makes me feel like I've got cancer
Crap film. Just stop.
Bro when i first saw this it gave me the litral chills!
BILL DAN ERNIE
I actually saw this movie was totally awesome, my honest reaction we they won against Garaka was epic. My favourite character in this movie was probably the Firemaster, his reaction after he saved the world with the New Ghostbusters is happy. It was an opportunity to watch it. Love it.
The was actually better then the movie
R.I.P Harold Ramis . Hey! Gay buster
I'm concerned that this movie will predict an ironic future.
Looks amazing love Ghostbusters movies except the one with the female only ghostbusters, glad too see the original guys back with family members great storyline 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Gozel
Çox maraqlı vəə çox xoşuma gəldi  həqiqətən möhteşemsiz
Güzel bir filim
One of my favorite childhood movies bro always said one day they'll make a new one this si great!!
I freaking loved this movie! :)
1:55 uhhhh this scene is not in the movie…? 😂😂😂😂😂
Was pretty great, would recommend 👻
Absolutely loved the intro!
The villain better be Elsa or I'm not watching this one 😂
Hopefully this will be good I didnt like the one with female cast ,I grew up with the original Two ghost busters
wow what a great film can't wait for it to come out
Saw this yesterday on release day, and LOVED it!!❤
1:55 well that scene wasn’t in the movie….
Omg! Very crazy film amazing!
I really really wanted to love the new movie, the higher moments are higher than Afterlife, but overall it was underwhelming :( It really feels like an episode from a Netflix serie: plot is basic and cliché, many characters aren't really useful and with a lot of cringe moments.  The original Ghostbusters is my fav movie of all time and I had many hopes, as for Afterlife which despite many weird decisions, I think it's still better than Frozen Empire overall.  Less over the top scenes, more story oriented, pacing, even more true horror moments etc. In any case, the 1984 is still unmatched!
frozen empire is smashing the box office unlucky critics the fans are here for our guys the ghostbusters
Just saw Ghostbusters Frozen Empire, and I enjoyed it!!! It is an awesome film with humor, emotion, heart, and is a great combination of new and old!!!
Epic is going to be epic.😊😊😊😊
Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is so much fun! This time, new and old Ghostbusters team up to battle an ancient demon that wants to freeze Manhattan. The special effects are mind-blowing, especially when they're chasing the icy ghosts. Also, this movie is really funny and features cool new ghostbusting gadgets and special appearances by some of the original cast members.
Fantastika janrini sevirem.

Shown in Theaters with: 1. The Marvels 2. Napoleon  3. Godzilla Minus One 4. Wonka 5. Anyone But You 6. Ferrari  7. The Book of Clarence  8. I.S.S.
Ghostbusters has 4 movies because Ghostbusters l and ll are the same movies and Ghostbusters Afterlife which is part lll and Ghostbusters Frozen Empire is part lV/4 which is the new movie.
Both me and my son are super excited for this!!!!
Kind of reminds me of the movie The Day After Tomorrow.
Anyone else noticed that currently the two biggest movies of the month both deal with ice villans
What song is this.?
I can't wait to watch it

One way to rally New Yorkers.  Get that siren going...
This is nothing compared to the tyrants dungeon back on terraria
What’s so cool is I saw them film this 😅
Everyone saying it’s original. This is a direct ripoff of Day after Tomorrow, but only a ghost caused it not a weather fluke.
I think this will be the last one because there's only so many scenarios you can come up with before it gets old

Please don't be a womanly empowerment fluff writing story. I want this not to such really bad lol.
Those people on the ferris wheel nevermade it out
So first, their mistake was resurrecting it as a comedy, then they did Stranger Things, but now they’re gonna make it like a freaking marvel movie.
Doesn't anybody remember that Ghostbusters is supposed to be comedy???  WHAT the heck???
🔥 ❄️ 👻 👿
Can't Wait Until March 22nd 2024!! 😎👍❄️❄️👻👻
Seems like it may have a political message to it. CLIMATE CHANGE OR SOMETHING
I liked how they added a new villain “the death chill” I can’t wait.
I’m 39 and taking my 9 year old son to see this holds a special place in my heart.
Gostei muito
It literally gave me chills watching the scene when the town froze over it looks so fantastic!  I can't wait to see this! I'm so excited!  I'm a huge Ghostbusters loyal fan love you guys so much god bless you 😊 🙏🏼 ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ 😘😘😍😍😇🤗🤯🥳😱💗💗💗💗💗💗💫✌🏼👏👏👏👏👻
Not crazy about this ice nonsense
Legal imagens especiais
Honestly ghostbusters stay great as long as there is a diffrent story to each pne and new characters in em and the best cgi ever.
Flood Escape 2: A New Generation
Looks good but the real magic wil never return... 👻
Top esse trailer
parece a vez em que meu priminho colocou mijo na caixinha de gelo, ficou fantasmagórico 👻
Just seen a new trailer dropped..am patching it 😂 this one was enough... ❤
The Comedy of the female ghostbusters was way better then this knock off movies franchise their trying to salvage, unless they do a universe crossover where all three teams of GB fight like godzilla instead. Ghostybusters VS GODZILLA
Never knew bout this 😮 shows how little tv I watch..def looking  for it,.
I enjoyed Afterlife, really awesome, this looks like another hit for me. I just can't help wondering if they did the original script ghostbusters 3 back in the 90's, would it be just as good.
I hate this Fu****g trailer!?! Too much spoiled!!!!!😢😢😢😢
love it.
Wow we are finally seeing a ghost busters reboot done properly. W
The Ghostbusters been going for years now and i was not that keen on the last one but will they smash it this time around,
The band's getting back together
No thanks
It more than a movie it's a foreshadow of what is to come. Cruel summer Taylor Swift. Election Year Purge movie.
Ghostbusters To Save People of New York from Frozen Ghosts
I thought this was fake until I looked online lol
I appreciated the Afterlife reboot, I was put off watching it after that god awful 2016 none effort, and I didnt want to spoil the memories of the original two, but this proper third installment was a joy, the balance between comedy, carton and live action, was excellent if you ask me. The story, yeah, it was indeed floated around the original, but there was nothing wrong with it, it was updated and different enough and it worked amazingly well, providing a proper reboot.  So, I am looking forward to the next film and I never really say that because when you get to a certain point in a franchise, it can get all a bit tired, but after seeing Afterlife, I'm hopeful for it's future... And I'm thankful for that as it took me right back to the day! :)  Oh, and I don't think we've seen the last of Gozer either if you ask me! :)
Why isn't it called Ghostbusters: Scared to Death?
PLEASE JUST DON'T MILK THIS FRANCHISE EVEN MORE! IT'S ENOUGH!
GReat fan of all Ghostbusters movie since 1980
That will be really cool if jean jacket from nope will come back from the dead and comes as soon when the rides stop and the people will say “what is that, is that an ufo
The sellout is in this, I'll pass ..
I do not like this teaser
I hat this movie
Afterlife was recycled garbage. I hope this one is better with no wokeness
this better do good in theaters or else
Ghostbusters - The Day after tomorrow ;)
This will be stupid fun and I'll love it
Looks excellent? 😊
102 k number suck on you tub
So no second trailer then
So where are the ghosts? I guess that was one at the very end.
I would love to see some use of Filmation villain ghosts for future films
Looks wack
Let be honest old Ghostbusters are best new Ghostbusters are mess
Nixverstehen ich nur deutsch
that happened to me once.
I’m so excited for this
Opens in 2 months!!! I hope this is good or better than Afterlife Excited to see the older cast again and Paul Rudd again
3 isr34li dual citizenship actors typical. Psh, scary film is isr3al gets GAZAS NATURAL GAS  and build canal thru gaza $$$$$$$
How the hell have I not seen this trailer yet.
I feel like Afterlife was to get OG fans back and forget 2016, and also give the original cast a good send off of them passing on the torch, and now this movie is gonna be the *actual* story about the new cast. Afterlife was for the old cast to get a proper send off, Frozen Empire will be for the new cast to really shine and make their own enemies
It’s so cool to have another ghost busters and there’s so many so it’s like every single week there’s a new Ghostbusters and I’m so excited I have frozen empire ❄️❄️❄️
I was scared of the other ghostbusters movie but ready to watch this one💪
Gay asf
Interesting movie
People Will Die In Very Nasty Ways In This Movie
I hope we get to see the fisherman ghost from the video game
If it was Chicago instead of NY no one would be running and screaming.
Me and my husband looking forward to seeing this movie
Nostalgia is what makes ghostbusters great. Afterlife was an ode to Harold Ramis and it was done quite well. This movie still involves the original ghostbusters, and so it should. The ghostbusters will always Venkman, Spengler, Winston and Ray.
Çok güzel bir film mutlaka izlemeniz gereken bir film
Izlemenizi siddetle tavsiye ediyorum😂
Güzelmiş ama gerilim de var süper 😮😮🎉

Süpermiş yaa 😮😮
İzlenmeye değecegini düşündüğüm bir film
İzlediğim en iyi filmlerden biri 👍👍💯
Goof
what would make you die fast burning or freezing?
Meh! Only the first original movie!
Ghostbusters series feels like its just grasping for straws anymore.  At this point its just a big name franchise from ages ago being milked.
Ghost Busters: Welcome to Russia  You must really add David Harbour to cast, tho.
Can't wait to watch this one. I loved Afterlife.
Expect a lot of CGI garbage and wokeness
Looks ropey.
I'm just glad they took a book from the real Ghostbusters. Cartoon series and put it on the big screen. If you never watched the cartoon, there was some really good and pretty intense episodes that would have made a great movie back then as well.

Just stop
It's great to see them continue doing that after afterlife I knew that it was open with the firehouse and ecto 1 being restored
Patton Oswalt sucks.  Guy is a douchbag
I’m glad they make the sequel of afterlife and not the 2016 cringe version 😂
Oh yeah I’m hyped for this.

I hope they keep the movies going and building onto the franchise long after the og characters pass away but this movie is going to be so awesome
Just so we are clear, all those kids on the ferris wheel died horrible, excruciatingly painful deaths...
But why Paul Rudd?
If Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray are in it I'll watch it
Maybe the trailer for ghostbuster six will be better
Maybe ghostbusters 6 be 4h movie Maybe Ghostbusters, 6 will be better than ghostbusters. Frozen empire and the cast will be way much bigger
I wish the ending of the movie was written better for this year twenty twenty four
Less funny more scary and action i can dig it👍
So... a paranormal disaster movie?
There will only ever be 2 ghostbusters movies...I hate to break it to you but this looks terrible and the only reason its being made it to cash in on the franchise. Nothing that made the originals  special can be found here and you are simply a hyper consumer with unrealistic expectations about entertainment.
Words cannot even explain how excited I am for this movie! And now it's coming out a week early!!!!
الإبداع والتشويق في محتوى هذا العمل الجميل
12 ghostbusters movie
Winter is coming 😂😂😂
I loved the first one and glad everyone is back. This reboot has that original vibe
They can't find anyone more qualified than physically weak and undersized teens and one adult in the biggest city on the continent? Really? It sort of worked in some rural Olkahoma town in nowheresville when they were thrust into a role that nobody expected, but this is different.
If ghostbusters were never a franchise it's okay
Patton Oswald is the worst thing about the film. Why him.
I have a feeling that peter Venkman is going to die. 😬😬
Hollywood is scraping the bottom of ths barrel now.
big daddys back
Weird trailer
'member when ghostbusters was good ?
This film is considered a classic in the world of cinema, as it combines humor with elements of science fiction. Unique characters and comedic horror scenes
After enjoying many fan made trailers the last days I suddenlly bump by this one and for a moment thought it was another fake movie. Wow let’s go for it!
Better back to the original from the 80s.
Like afterlifes trailer.. the music slays 😂 fkn loooooooove it ❤
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
I don't accept female Ghostbusters. Men and women are not the same and won't be. Stop trying to force something into existence that can never be !
ITS REALLY REALLY GOOD
I WAS AT THE PRE SCREENING
Well, so much for global warming...  Good to see most of the old gang is still around (peace, Harold) and the kids are ready to take up the toys.
Finally,  reckoning for all you sheep, you social media bullies and your damn thumbs up crap
Nope
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Interesting interesting. SO long as we have much more of the original guys
The Villain is named Garraka, as it was shown on a Funko Pop.
Although I wanted to see vigo return considering that’s what made the second movie fail I’m actually excited for this original idea
Looks good can't wait
WHEN??? I can't wait!!
I'm am ghostbusters number 1 fan I'm am seeing this
You not 100 to me
🙄I really don't care about all these new films. The new cast of characters are just meh bordering on annoying. It definitely doesn't help when there are certain actors in the movie that I have already boycotted due to their social media posts and their politics.   Wish there was another single player Ghostbusters game. But more like a 'GTA' open world RPG with character customization. Not making us play a no name nobody who doesn't speak.
رائع
Funny thing i didn't know this was a trailer for ghost busters until 0:58
Is the movie  2h
excited and scared. please be good please be good, please be good !!! lol

I am so hyped!! I LOVE GHOSTBUSTERS
Adults crying over a ghostbusters trailer is depressing. We’re doomed as a species.
It gives the feel of the old animated series.  A new big bad to deal with.
I dunno but that lion used to freak me out at the start of the 1984 ghostbusters with the intro music behind it! Now it moves after all that time!

OHHHHOHHOHHOHH!!! YES!

Fin and feather
Yoooooo, this looks GOOD. And the trailer is done well enough to not give it all away.  Plus, Paul's "OOOOooooooooooooohohohohoh" legit feels like a half in movie/half viewer reaction to the big bad.
افلام جميلة جدا!كم احب هذه الأفلام الرائعة ان اشاهدها ؟حقا رائعة!
More non-white filth in white culture 😢😢😢😢
Love the Ghostbusters and hope this one will be better than that terrible remake with the  chicks that wasn't even funny.
Bet  can't get 200k on you tub ghostbusters frozen empire
I hope the women busters make an appearance I'M NOT GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH YOU!
This is a great trailer.
FINN 😱😱😱😱
This seems way better then afterlife. After watching Afterlife once, it got boring. But this seems like an interesting and unique characteristic of a movie.
A solid effort by the writers.
Paul Rudd was meant for this Franchise!!!
They don’t have bill Murray on the cast list ?
Yuk Sony 😢
I don't know what trailer everyone else was watching but this looks so formulaic.  Bigger stakes, more explosions, more people etc.  And Rudd is cast as the useful idiot he plays in every.  Single.  Film.  Cracking jokes as droves of people are frozen to death, how Marvel of him.  This movie is going to be lukewarm at best and is only playing upon more nostalgia to make up for what, and mark my words, will be revealed to be basic writing and screenplay at best.  Looks 6/10, forgettable.
공식 OST좀 넣었으면 더 극적으로 보였을텐데 아쉽네
Tous les mecs ado ressemblent ils à des hommes soja dans votre monde ? C est vraiment la fin de notre civilisation.
Love it, cannot wait, go Ghostbusters
I've not been this hyped about ghosts busters since the 2nd movie.  (Don't get me wrong afterlife was really good too)
There’s always gonna be the word empire and movies in 2024 first Godzilla and Kong now this.
Uh......
Wife killer in the film no thanks
frozen but horror
This is gonna flop so hard.
more masons and scientologists movies with CGI, goal: to dumb down the brain.

NEW YORK CITY, THE GHOSTBUSTERS ARE BACK IN BUSINESS!  Oh my god I can’t even begin to describe how god it feels to finally see a sequel with energy and passion behind it, let’s see what this universe has to offer with something new.
Me on the Beach: uh oh.
So excited the story looks intriguing and having the O.G. ghostbusters is awesome! I like the direction they are heading just don't fumble it.
Cant wait to see it. It really brings back the childhood feeling I had when I saw GB1 and 2 in the 80s. It will preserve the legacy of the original movies.
Another cash cow with little substance ? Still got to be better than that Mc Carthy crap.
ADORO O GELÉIA!!!!!❤❤❤
This looks promising, I just hope it's not just another nostalgia dump truck like Afterlife is.
Yuck looks like final cut junk . Hey morons , don't use a Mac to edit the film or add effects ... it looks BADDD and fake.
I'm In
Paul Rudd sucks
Espero que el villano sea Santa Claus que se volvió malvado y poderoso.
After 2 years later they are back
it is ok, ......for kids.....meybe......
Well done Sony this is the way, keep up the good work, I'm sold on a cinema ticket.
Cool trailer
очередная хуета
Ugh, really not digging the direction of the franchise. Paul Rudd and kids. I'd rather have Paul Rudd and 3 other dudes like Chris Pratt, Patrick Wilson, Anthony Mackie
YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!
We just need Rick Moranis!
Why am I seeing this just now?!? This is giving me so much hype/hope as well as something to look forward to, especially since Star Wars is dead.
LET İT GO!!! LET İT GOO!!!
Are they still milking this franchise?
So Antman is now a Ghostbuster?!
take IP, use IP and make money. Rinse then repeat. Till that franchise is a moldy rotten stench
Alright, cool, I'm interested. Now, y'all going to remember that this is a comedy series, right?  And that it has to work as a comedy before you think about leaning too heavily on the nostalgia?
1:21 This shot looks so terrible, extremely poor blur where it makes Bill's head look distorted. This crap is what is passing for cinema now?
The title of it is dumb. But it looks pretty cool.
I hope this time of the originals have bigger parts. It was great that they were there, but they need more of that.  More of a combination.
Yay! Those forgettable characters from the forgettable reboot are back! And they put cameos by the original cast in the trailer too, so fans will have to go watch it! And it's an CGI driven movie where the world is threatened by something, what a fresh concept!
People actually think this will be good? Just wrong, I mean, Frozen Empire? So random and has nothing to do with ghosts, it screams being desperate to make some money somehow; just no.   Films are so terrible these days, washed out, diluted and quite simply.. Boring!
cool
Looks like they're ripping off Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze.
is me! (:
Hello! Ghostbusters
Nics❤
So this is what ant man does when he doesn’t hang out with the avengers
Just in time for the franchises 40th anniversary
Why are they still making these?
Can't Wait.
I hope Slimer shows up! 👻. Can't wait for this movie!!
I just finished watching afterlife. I’m so excited for the sequel and honestly after seeing the sequel, I predict there’s going to be four movies because think about it the first one was about the god of death second one God of third one god of fire and the fourth one, the god of the Earth.
lol Appropriate choice for a song at the start of the trailer.
When did ghostbusters stop being a comedy?
Normally, the new lineup in franchises can suck, but i really enjoyed the Afterlife cast. Now, with even more of the originals shown, should make this sequel awesome.
🎉🎉 👏👏👏👏👏⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Looks cool, wil it be? Probably not!
This trailer made this 53-year-old feel young again.
Filme com lacraçao é uma merda
oh good they dropped the other two random kids from the movie
Psyched.😎👍
How have I have not seen this trailer?! Trailer has been out a month already!
How do his puny arms have such strength 😂
Love it
GIVE ME.
Really good trailer. You get an idea without them giving away everything.
another crap...
"For the first time in history, people in NYC froze to death"- somebody never watched that documentary "The Day After Tomorrow."
Patton oswald? Pass.
😮‍💨
Something like The Day After Tomorrow meets Game of Thrones
Hopefully it’s better than the last 3 movies.
NO NO NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It doesn't feel the same, there's someone missing, Harold ramis
Im calling it now. I believe Peter Venkman will die in this movie when everything is getting frozen!
Can't wait to see this one 😲😃😄!!!
Thank you, Sony - GHOSTBUSTERS lives again!!!
No ghosts?
looks uninteresting
Sad this movie will probably will just be alright because the first half of the trailer was so well done
HELLLLL YESSSSSS
no thanks too many communists in this movie
seriously? fk off hollywood
Thank you!
As an ‘80’s child, I believe one of the most iconic sounds is the siren from Ecto-1.
Even 10yo kids can make better movie, then grown up feminist women
Ghostbusters tropical freeze
Meh
I liked afterlife a lot but there’s nothing like a ghostbusters film in New York City!
Not sure how I feel with the film opening with what must be hundreds of thousands of dead people of all ages (I thought we were done with films having mini genocides in them like in that 'newer' ST movie with the spaceship crashing and taking out like dozens of heavily populated city towers or the dub step machine in that superman movie).  Feels a little off for this series.  Maybe they undo it in the end.
This looks really good excited for this reboot
Küçükken en sevdigim filmlerden biriydi.Umarim yeniside güzeldir.Hayalet avcıları 💪🤩
James Acaster!!? Is that you? ❤
Please please push forward on with the story (As there is so much that could be told in movie sequels) and not just the Nostalgia, as i think it will turn in to something EPIC!!! I love this tralier and what the movie will be, Thank you!!
I'm 100% sure this is gonna suck.
OMG don't let them butcher it anymore
I bet 100000$ dollars ghostbusters frozen empire  Won't get one hundred percent Rotten  tomatoes
I bet that 98k number won't go up on you tub
Everyone in the world needs to give this video a thumbs down
98k don't care

I only hope it’s as good as Afterlife. Afterlife is what GB 2 should have been in my opinion. I get why it didn’t work out that way. And 1 movie can be forgotten. Like the third Mummy movie. Forgotten. But AL was made and did the OG great honor and respect. IMO.
This looks amazing
I saw this trailer in the cinemas and from the beginning I thought “Oh, another natural disaster movie. That seems cool” then I see the ghostbusters logo
Ghostbuster 1984 was dark, that’s what they need to take from the original 💯
AND THE ORIGINAL GHOSTBUSTERS ARE BACK AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Remember how we used to think ghostbusters are dead after 2016 disaster? Never been so glad for being wrong.
Why even bother
Gosh, they don't want to quit. They tried and tried and all promises die with the trailers (that many time are more interesting that the actual movies). You can't catch the genie of the era because that era is gone.
liked Afterlife, really loking forward to this one, love how they stay true to the originals and honor them while also being original and able to stand on its own without overly relying on the great classics i grew up with, live how the old team gets to show their experience and expertise without being overshadowed by the new generation while also not overshadowing the new generation, just the right balance of new and old for both old and new fans.
MIKE IS THAT YOU
they wont budget a new idea for a movie anymore just these crappy sequels, hollywood is dead,
If it's a Ghostbusters movie and it's not from the 80s it's just fanfiction.
2:05 are way too long for a teaser trailer.
I thought ghostbusters was done
Paul Rudd was born to be a Ghostbuster.
Anyone else miss the lady squad?
Still not as cold as the reviews from film critics when this inevitably bombs at the box office.
Best part is the gals bum at 0.42. Seriously these classics are being milked to death now! Here's a suggestion "GIVE IT UP NOW!" You are Murdering a bunch of films in the name of Divesity!
Now this is what ghostbusters should be, not the feminist abomination they made before
I love it
Is Hollywood only allowed to have one song in all their movies?
milk it boys
Surprised we didn’t have to wait decades for Ghostbusters 4.
I wish they would have seen the Extreme Ghostbusters cartoon series, that was amazing...
Still can’t believe you didn’t call it “Ghostbusters: Polargeist.” Sigh…
Milking it now at this point
This looks EPIC!  I can’t wait to watch this!  I mean, they’re doing what looks like a cross between Hell Bent and Extreme!  I would’ve been happy if they had just picked one!
Infantiloide
sooo Climate Change is just ghosts? This is the best script they could come up with?
Who’s the old lady??
The beginning of this trailer was Michael Bay’s Spider-Man! Also ice ain’t ghosts. Ghostbusters 2 was the best because it actually gave us a ton of ghosts. And better humor. And Vigo.
My son loves them since i introduced him to first 2 movies then we watched afterlife on release and will be going in march for this one and il probably watch this one 3 times at cinema aswell
I am the eggs popping on Dana's counter
Not see this movie if not 2h
YES! I am so happy to see another new Ghostbusters coming. So glad they are letting that horrible woman one die where it did and continuing with a newer franchise that has real potential!!!
Nothing is better in this 21st century. Liars.
Erm... nooooo... no.  This isn't Ghostbusters. :(
Another woke snooze fest. These money grabs are getting a bit tedious.
Where is my favorite song!!!!))))))))))
As we all know 2024 will be the 40th anniversary of the release of the first Ghostbusters movie
The reason for the last one to have nostalgia nods as it was meant to send off Harold Ramis/Egon as most of the nods were from his quotes, but I am loving this one as it is original and a brand new villain too add to the Ghostbusters Universe.
Best they could do was Patton Oswald...stinks of 2016
whats up with the bs colourgrading
Look at all of these bot comments lol, everyone is "super excited" about the movie and "loved" afterlife. Damn, marketing is getting desperate these days
They have FUBARed this franchise beyond all recovery.
Does anyone smell turkey?
i am farting for you
Top comments here are either bots or people who think like bots. Afterlife was terrible. CGI Ramis was an unethical abomination. Don't be sheep. This franchise is getting milked and it's disgusting.
I love this new monster already! It looks like the kind of crazy original creature the Ghostbusters Animated Series would’ve given us.
Looks too woke for me smh what a shame
Ghostbusters: Krampus
Idk why I always get surprised seeing Bill Murray alive after seeing him get killed in Zombieland
There's a woke vibe that could destroy everything... let's see what really happens...
why?
It's gonna be a kids movie the original cast will just be cameos..
utter bollocks
Ok this is the point where it gets all trendy ,woke and becomes garbage. Looks like it's the end of the road for this series.
Where is the ghostbusters music?!
Lissandra from lol???
I hope that in the movie we wouldnt see to many Marvel type humor. I just hate how they ruine tention moments for the lame joke.
THIS Is SUPPOSED TO BE OVER. LET IT GO.
Of course theres a harry potter girlboy in it
When?
Missed opportunity to instead call it “Ghostbusters: Bone Chill”
another terrible movie?
I have not seen anyone else mention this anywhere, so I am guessing I am wrong... but that looked like Kate Mckinnon at 1:30 . After finding nothing anywhere confirming this, I am guessing it must be Carrie Coon. Someone, please tell me I'm not crazy.
I love Spengler & Venkman, my kids love Elsa & Anna.  Frozen 3 here we come. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉. But seriously, I’m beyond excited that they are continuing the Ghostbusters Franchise, makes me hopeful for the future. ❤
“So cool”  Literally
I'm excited because I am fan of Ghostbusters
1:46
nah. rather stay home and save money.
Will there be ghostbusters 7 movie?
Rather gruesome for what was originally a comedy movie.
I'm glad they finally got these Ghostbuster sequels right after that debacle of a "sequel" in 2016
His BACK!
It’s the The Day After Tomorrow with Ghostbusters.
wow , this actualy looking like a real stupid a$$ movie
could do without patton oswald thanks.
Ecto1 the old girl still has it 😅
Actually kicking the dead horse
Um....wheres podcast?
More garbage.  Great.
Looks like absolute crap. Hard pass. WRITE A NEW STORY!
0:06 uhm am i the only one noticing that the Ford Tauras is literally moving by itself 😂.  Pause at the timeframe and you'll see what I mean
Wow… stealing from Jaws? Really?  Pass.
Where the funny?
What are all the homeless migrants going to do?!
More woke evil, no thanks.
Totally unrealistic with happy people with jobs and not a single fat person or a fentanyl zombie in sight.
Hard pass. I skipped the last one. I wish that I had passed on the chicks one. (For the record I like most of the female cast in other things). There is no way that I am going anywhere near this one.
I liked Ghostbusters, answer the call - hilarious!
Oh no... I think they should make another Ghostbuster movie with an all female cast... again.... because we all know women are sooooooooo funny and not cringy at all...
I hope its not woke garbage.
Just let it die already.
Dude, a moive where the ghostbusters fight some real horror. Nice.
Thank God the 2016 wreck was just ignored like the Epstein Client List.
👶🍼
Look at the like to dislikes haters. You lose...again.
UGGHHHHHHH.....
Noooo!!!! Plz STOP!
gay
OVERRATED TRASH
More WOKE reboots I will NEVER watch
Trash.... Ghost can control the weather now..  This is gonna bomb... bet me a $1.00.  They need to go back and watch the very first ghostbuster.. 100 times.. no wonder the roles for the old mains are so small and pointless..  Just listening to him explain the death chill... smh..
Sorry but ghostbusters is a series which has ended long ago and reviving it at this point is a no go.
Lissandra League of Legends??
South Park has a "frozen ice age" themed game coming out. Now Ghostbusters is doing the same theme? Predictive programing.
Yo 2024 is getting amped up already with exciting movies and games afterlife was absouty awsome paying omage to the boys too each and every single way thank you ghost busters
Defiantly seeing this. LOVED Afterlife. I couldn't stop crying at the end. This reboot has that original vibe.
I just wonder if this was apart of the org screen play by Dan if you watch the making of the org movie they said it would have been 4 hours long and cost more then they could have been able to get at the time. The org screen play was so elaborate that even the tech at the time the movie was made would have not been able to be created.
10/10 cruel summer is a masterpiece! I am also a huge ghostbusters fan so I’m looking forward to the release date!
I hat this movie
I am so hyped that almost poo'd myself !
finally an actual sequel worth watching
so everything is marvel movie now
Hopefully this one actually has ghosts in it, I mean for a movie called "Ghost" busters, "Afterlife" only had 1 single blue ghost in it, then straight to dog monsters, then the main villain, then that's it. Super lame.
This looks horrendous. Talk about getting the vibes completely wrong. People literally freezing to death and they're standing there giggling about it? And you send KIDS out to deal with that? And this miserable pandering with the old actors. Eugh, this is so calculated and cynical.
could there be LESS heart in a trailer?
I would like to, personally thank whoever thought it was a great idea to give Paul Rudd a proton pack because *chefs kiss* was that a great idea
March can't come fast enough
yeah i pass
Another shtty woke movie going to fail? Popcorn please!
Опять это деpьмо их сундука достали...
Trash
The last ghostbusters movie was so bad. This new version will either be the final nail in the coffin or a complete 180.
So you're telling me ice spike came from the surface of earth and no died pathetic !!!
Looks bad lmao
1:29 James Acaster, Bebeeh!
Afterlife = next generations of ghostbusters
Let it Go! Let it Go!
Great, women and children... Apparently Winston doesn't pay well.
looks good! Hope we live long enough to see it.
According to Nanjiani, the filmmakers drew inspiration from the animated series The Real Ghostbusters (1986-1992) for the film, noting they "wanted to make a long episode of the animated series".
Alguien sabe la fecha de estreno cuando se estrena
Necesito ver mas de casafantasmas la nueva generación seria magnífico que  hagan una saga mas de estas pelis pero con chicos nuevos con la desendecia de los originales  jjj seria la bomba xddd
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
idiots in action what a disgusting film
I love Ghostbusters... but maybe it's time to Let it go
this looks like the most disgusting, soulless movie I have ever seen
am i the only one who had a came to  with Wild Hunt?
Giving the phrase "when hell freezes over" a whole new meaning.
Love it! Thanks for making this!
James Acaster!
garbage
I saw a white male actor in this!! CANCEL THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY!
Patton Oswalt??? Ugh I'll catch it on prime...
This might actually be good. No woke bullshit like the last two. I might actually give sony my $ this time.
I discovered a few days ago that my mother with 63 has never seen ghostbusters. Next year she goes to retirement, than we have to watch the movies but not the 2016 bs
This is what happens when a director lost his logic mind
I was right. In Afterlife if you looked in the room with the pit where the contament was on the back wall was dates and when this comes out is with that time line
Looks horrible...
Disney really had to make ANOTHER sequel to Frozen?
I'm glad we're transitioning immediately into original territory now that the new team is fully established. We had our fun making callbacks and homages with Afterlife, but the mistake too many remake/sequel films make is getting stuck retreading old ground and forgetting to make anything new. This trailer instantly shows us that won't be a problem. It's also nice that the old Ghostbusters are sticking around, but I think that after being mentored by them for a little while, the new team will be strong enough characters by the end of this movie to carry the franchise on their own. I'll never say no to having Ray, Winston, and Venkman around, but it feels comforting to know that they're just a bonus addition to an already strong cast, not a nostalgia crutch. Objectively speaking, the actors aren't going to be around forever, and it's good to know that when they, too, pass on, the franchise name will still be in good hands.
yyyyeah... , i'll pass.
Ugh, here we go again.
I DONT CARE WHAT YALL SAY. THIS IS GONNA BE 🔥🔥🔥
I would love ,i know he was blown up in the original.but mr stay puft mske s return ..snd slimer ,had sll the toys in the mid 80s they be worth s fortune now ...bring back sigourney weaver as dana Barratt & rick moranis as louis tully
They are still making these?! LMAO
Just be good and improve on afterlife, that’s all I ask of thee
Not if it's like the last couple of films thanks.
milking it like no tomorrow
Hopefully they bring back ecto cooler this time
it's a waste of time.
Always kids in movies... Can't see it anymore.
Hope the movie will be enjoying.
They still missing what made the 1st movie funny.  This looks like your average action film and not a comedy at all...and that's the problem.  Please stop making Ghostbuster movies, thank you.
Looks cool but I don't want no little kids as ghostbusters. I'm sorry.
Will Be Official Trailer Now Please….
Bless them they’re trying so hard. Some things are better left undone.
Fun :)
Why are all these comments written by bots???
Just a whole lot of cgi, looks more like an over the top marvel movie.
Looks like GTA 6 Addon
oh hell yeah❤❤❤❤❤
Trailer drums, making every movie feel the same!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Wheres VIGO??
ANOTHER DOPE MOVIE I CANT WAIT TO WATCH CASTING IS PERFECT 🔥
More woke agenda bs
Glad to see Afterlife get a sequel. It was a little shaky, but a good movie overall; I'm happy they get another chance to find their groove.
Great to see they kept last movies characters and didn't try a rebrand or reboot. This looks great.
Flog that dead horse!
hollywood please just stop making films we dont even watch them anymore  ya done
These ghost a murdering
I hope that is film breaks the record of Ghostbusters The Afterlife in the box office
I can't wait to see what James Acaster adds to this
Looks awful
Another IP murdered
did not see the last because of the woke feminsts leads but this one ill watch because of Bill murray. men rule baby..
I just finished watching afterlife a cant wait to see this on so exited
hollywood has been missing out on ghosts and all the stories you could tell
Gonna be another feminism bullshit story i can already predict it.
It ain't ghostbusters until they play Bobby Brown's "On Our Own" in the movie!!!
Man I love Mckenna Grace!
Enough with this trash, let the brand die or give it a proper movie with a good director
Yooo! I'm hyped already.
мммм... говноооо!
Glad Bill Murray is back
Let it go.,Let it go...!
I am so glad ghost busters is good again with the OG cast involved
looks crap, everything after ghostbusters 2 forget about. CGI overload!!!
Please stop
I like this new Ghostbusters and all but I kind of wish they had a team of comedians that were more fun to watch. Like you can't really feel the same excitement for the newer movies. Its fun to watch but you don't have that "HELL YEA" feeling. Id rather watch guys like Chris Pine play a ghostbuster. Someone with charm and cocky charisma.
My god, isn't there one creative writer left in Hollywood, I'm getting sick of all those remakes and spinoffs. Write some good, new and original stories.
1:51 is that you Lissandra?
Anyone else appreciate there wasn't an obnoxious out of place Rap, Pop, or other current IT song playing during any part of this? I wish more movie trailers did that or hell, crazy concept, use the music the goddamn composers worked their asses off making. It was basically like the original trailer 3 years ago, even used some of the same sound cues, more of this please!
Can we stop getting the same recycled IP's. It's time for new content, nobody wants to go to the movies anymore because its super corporatey
meh such a bs .. same crap like the movie before
For the love of god, cinema is dead. Please, give us something original.. I'm sure all the normies will love this though.
Before watching the trailer, let me guess: They learned their lesson after the last Ghostbusters flop lost them all that money; so they will not make another all-woman team. But they still caved to feminism and made at least ONE of the Ghostbusters a woman, or put them all under a woman's authority.  Edit: Yep. Who woulda thought.
Nope, Ghostbusters is DEAD
yes Ghostbusters are back since 1980
Where's bill murray.  Where's Vigo.  When will they face Satan
Uhm, this actually looks great? 🙂
I wonder if they'll put a chick in it and make her gay...
The CGI in this looks absolutely terrible
As long as there's no woke garbage.
i love this and hope we get ghostbusters movies going into the lore even more this was original and I hope it does even better than Afterlife
How can Ghostbusters work in freezing weather Weird
At the risk of tempting fate, I am excited!  GHOSTBUSTERS 1984 (of course) 10/10 , GHOSTBUSTERS II (1989) (Had an impossible act to follow. But still ok.) 5/10  Leslie Jones 2016 zero!  Sorry ladies! A# A  AFTERLIFE (2021) Automatic 10/10 for erasing 2016!  This new FROZEN EMPIRE looks like it's going to be great! 🏮
Looks rubbish what a surprise
So it's Day After Tomorrow...but with ghosts. Sigh.
Female cast really sucked, this isn't giving me much faith with the lady man teens.
Meh
This looks really good.
wife killer patton oswalt... PASS
So we've gone from like three total on-screen deaths across four movies to... Millions and millions of people from the Jersey Shore to Manhattan frozen to death.  Guys, I don't think busting makes me feel all that good anymore.  This feels so much less like a horror comedy and more like every generic action hero blockbuster with witty banter from the past 15 or so years.
i dunno if i would have made Ghostbusters apocalyptic. thats not really the vibe that made it awesome in the 80s 🤷‍♂
love the franchise, hope its good
This looks like it is going to be WAY to serious for a Ghostbusters movie.
Amazing 😊
I hope Louis Tully is there
This looks awesome!
Not falling for the hype a second time around. Our favourite characters have been replaced and appearing in the trailer doesn’t mean they’re part of the movie, just that they’ll make a cameo near the end.
Ghostbusters Afterlife, and this new one, they managed to do something that the Star Wars sequel Trilogy did not, give us an on-screen reunion or on-screen interaction involving the original characters.  Me and many fans were upset that we never got an on-screen reunion or an on-screen interaction with Han, Luke, and Leia for one last time.
Patton and kumali? What you couldn’t get Chris hardwick too?
The death chill seems like such a complicated villain to defeat as it seems to be literal ice and cold. It’d be interesting to see how they defeat it
yes!
Where’s the music who you gonna call ? Miss that . Otherwise nice
Dude dont even i havent even watched afterlife yet
This just looks bad.
Major pass. Ghostbusters 1 & 2 are the only ones that are worth watching
oh wait, but why there is no sequel to the other Ghostbuster remake? :D
Stupid humor.  This looks awful.
I like the original ghostbuster beter the 198? Ghostbusters better
I purchased an X-Large Men's Ghostbusters Jumpsuit with included a Proton Pack from Amazon and will wear it when I see Ghostbusters Frozen Empire at the Theaters.👻❄🎞📽🍿😊👍👍
M-o-r-o-n-i-c.
The actual release date is 3/29/24
Lol… They haven’t run this franchise far enough into the ground, yet?
I like it the way they are introducing new cast while retaining original one. always ready to watch a GHOSTBUSTERS movie.
Whenever they incorporate 80s music it just makes it better
Put patton oswalt in more movies.
20 million views in 1 week then stuck on 20 million for 2 weeks after lol
I love this movies.👍
This looks pretty good. What is even more awesome is that part of the movie is taken place where I grew up, Coney Island, NYC 😎
Some things are better off Dead.....like the Ghostbusters Trilogy. LET IT DIE. DO SOMETHING NEW FFS. I will not be spending money on this.
xin chào tất cả các bạn yêu quý
Harika duruyor 👍
So what happened to the all-girl ghostbuster movie?
And so the Ghostbusters face their greatest foe: Old Man Winter.
why is the CGI so bad
Color me crazy but imagine a super powered ecto version of a gmc yukon or a new grand wagoneer.
Take a look at the ammount of comments on this video, now split that number by half and you'll get the real ammount of viewers that this movie will have
Some what woke but not too woke like the female version
Mike going in there without El is NOT a good idea.
okay frozen empire awesome name for the type of situation that's happening in the movie and also i can't wait to see what the main antagonist: the death chill looks like
On Saturday, 8 o’clock at daytime
In the playground
Ghostbusters, can you please come meet me Malta in Belcara Tres please please please please with all the Ghostbusters, my name is Yan I am eight want to meet you
Ok, the new villain is terrifying.
Kumail Nanjiani & Paul Rudd . Good to see you both ❤
They are just showing you what they gonna do😏
Who do you call Ghostbusters👻🚫
They've ruined it even more. Democrats look forward to these new woke movies.
❤
Geostorm with ghosts and without Gerard Butler?
i mean no hate towards him, but patton oswald seems out of place, at least what we see in the trailer anyway, maybe it will feel right in the actual movie
THIS. THIS is how you do a Legacy Movie!!!
It looks hilarious guys, bravo.
another franchise butchered
looks bad
I've yet to see Sony make a decent film.
The legend himself Dan Aykroyd is starting to look like his judge character from Nothing But Trouble. Makeup department in that one nailed it.
Afterlife was a serious tear jerker, a worthy successor.  I have high hopes for it and cant wait to see this.  Please dont woke it up.
Looks Cool.
The ice theme worked for the movie FROZEN, why not Ghostbusters 🙂
Release date
Its amazing to think how hard for entertainment business is to stop milking the same cow over and over again. I mean with the after life they could have finished but I bet they will keep making it until it becomes a tv series like with fast and furious. So many creative people are around yet hollywood stayed the same for centuries
basically tuesday in Russia
Ghostbusters 5 will suck so bad I shot the big Screen
🫡👎🗣🤣😆🫠🤯💩😤🤬😡👋🤚🙌✊️👊👏🧠🧠🫀🫀🫀🦶🦶🦶🧞‍♂️❤
I love this casts
another product
Bill Murray, aren’t you ashamed to star in this, you personally said that you won’t star in this franchise any time soon, for what amount can you sell your dignity?
Please stop making more movies :(
🍌👻Bananarama👻🍌
Louis Tully? ... If he shows up, I'd would burst out crying. ... 😉
Baby Oscar ... ?  ... He should be all grown up now .. 😉
If Slimer is in this ... I will lose my shhhhhh 🫠
As a 40 year old O.G. Ghostbusters fans, i'm loving the hints of nostalgia ... How did they get the Statue of Liberty back onto Liberty Island? That's what I want to know.
So now they have to deal with an ice grim reaper ghost
They say coming soon... PLEASE BE FOR END OF THIS YEAR SOON!!
Bananarama in the intro, what's not to love
When there''s something wrong ! . . . . Who you going to call ?
looks good
Who composed the music in this trailer? Natalie Holt perhaps? Getting Loki vibes from it :)
I like how serious it looks. It's to the point where the few jokes we see feel kinda forced and out of place.
This is going to be like the X-Men: Days Of Future Past of Ghostbusters
дерьмооооо
First remake was only bad, this looks only woke, another wokebuster ..... not for my generation, maybe for the new small woke generation as well the last Marvels loosing money every week.
1:38 That’s so cool! 1:43 Ghostbusters 5: Frozen 🥶 Empire logo 1:56 Coming Soon 🔜 (March 29th 2024)
ghostbuster with a taste of stranger things..
Looks good, can't wait
People want to see the original actors in action, not just cameos.
So Ecto 1 doing power slide's is a staple now? Just saying in rel life its damn near impossible to pull off on a 7000 pound caddie.
James…..Acaster? 😮
YES!
WHEN IS IT COMEING OUT?
This is going to be so dire 😂
This looks promising. After the last movie, I’m really looking forward to this cast and the storyline. Nothing beats the very first Ghostbusters.
Meh
Did not expect the old actors to be back. Love that, just hope they'll be in it more this time. And that it will be more passing of the torch. Also glad it takes place in New York.  I made a reaction video to this, don't sue me Sony.
Amazing!!! Really excited for this! Can't wait until spring! 🎉🎉🎉
Hantu in ghostbusters?
This wake garbage will flop at the box office.
Why do these keep coming out??
ALRIGHT WHO LET ELSA INTO NEW YORK!!!
Brought the dudes back reviews skyrocketed😂😂😂
Ghostbusters- Climate emergency  🤣🤣🤮🤮
Görsel efektler çok saçma geldi bana😏
went from wearing the Ghostbusters outfit as a Halloween costume in Stranger Things, to actually being in a Ghostbusters universe!
God is REAL God is active* He speaks the TRUTH Vivek"  for US President 2024!
LEEESSSS GOOOOO
where is the women ghost buster and the big gorilla one?
Good fake)
Will need to read the first reviews before I decide to go see it, if it's woke then I am out ...
Hmm all that frozen stuff didn't do it for me.  But i like to see the old guys one time more..  And especially the new young ghostbuster girl.    Just don't think this movie is as magigal as AFTERLIFE was in its nostalgia way
Everything looks promising, except for the Silicon Valley dude, he’s annoying in most movies.
just like the last trailer! Flipping epic and yet I got the jest of the plot and not much in spoilers!!!! this is how trailers should be!.
I want to say there willbe a staypuft marshmallow man
🤡💩🤮🤮
Yes
This is soooooooo stupid
Another film that no one asked for
Volcano fallout
"So be good, for goodness sake! Whoa... somebody's coming!"
Who Left The Fridge Open…
Almost looks real!
👎
Another woke movie
Looks a bit corny
IT GETS FUNNIER
I like this so far. I look forward to it
Ну хоть не 4 тупые женщины в фильме
I don’t know if I like the casting they could have pick someone else besides paul rudd. He plays ant man so is ant man going to kill the ghosts.😂😂 I know it’s probably a different universe but it still feels like a bad casting choice.
Trying to compete with sharknado with those ice spikes
lol was just thinking about the monumental failure of the ghostbusters 2016
i might watch this the day after tomorrow
i maybe get goosebumps for 5 things in my life and i've been here a while. The siren of ECTO1  is absolutely one of them
Zin 🇰🇵👑🇰🇵
Whatever
Please make Ghostbusters great again.
wow, I’m very excited for this movie.
Cool! Get it?
I PRAY THE NEXT MOVIE IS NOT PROGRESSIVE, WOKE AND FEMINIST... GHOSTBUSTER... resurfaced with Afterlife... IT WAS INCREDIBLE... I hope the SAGA CONTINUES THIS SUBLIME
I'm going to assume lots of editing is being done in the comments section because Afterlife was a huge disappointment, and if the trailer for the latest film is anything to go by I think it is safe to say this will also be a big old bag o'shite
Why is it when a major disaster is coming everyone just  stands there  staring until it's too late, then they run????
Uuuugh, just pull the plug already!
Should of been an Xmas movie.
Winter is Coming🤣
I'm in. BUT I want to see some teeth here too. If this ice ghost is scary, show me that on screen. And I'm not talking about ice effects. I want the main villain to be something to really be afraid of and make sure that comes across on screen.
Cringe
another stinker
Ughhhhh
Didn't know this was coming... wow ... am excited to see this... hopefully a worthy sequel to afterlife
Remove Patton Oswald hes so unlikable. Worst thing about the movie is his involvement.
and Gojira appltv series just shown an ICE titan ... 🤔  nonetheless this GB flick looks interesting
only in cinemas 2024.
*Nice seeing the old crew even if it's not all of them*
Looks awful
Bro said 🎅
LOOKS COOL. Will catch it in the theater.
oh man oh man oh man. This could be the one. The first movie I go see since Covid.
Что за пидеррстия.?
Teaser trailer was no good
I bet you good money this movie will not be good And the running time will suck
Ghostbusters was go see at the movie 2024
I'm not going to see if this movie if it's 1 hour and 3 minutes. But if it's a three hour movie, i'm okay with it or r two hour movie Maybe this one will not be good Is what for life will be better with 2024 rod tomato review would not be good
i like how it seems to going back to a more serious tone
THE GIANT SLOR!
Someone told me Rick Moranis is back
😂😂😂 at least bill murray didnt disappear 25 yrs not trying to film ghostbusters
I love GB
I can already hear 'let it go' from afar when that shadows appeared
This looks really cool. Can't wait to check it out.
no thanks
1:51 Lissandra D:
Now That’s a trailer for a film I want to see!  Finally!
So it's The Day After Tomorrow.
So Lissandra is the main antagonist?
But... but what about that all-girl Ghostbusters team with the ladies who were constantly ad-libbing? Are we just pretending that didn't happen now?   Well, okay. I mean, that's fine with me.
Was hoping it'd just be the family trio and OG cast this time around, can't see why Lucky and Podcast from first film need to be in this one? They were pointless filler characters in the first movie, Lucky moreso than Podcast despite that they fulfilled their roles in that movie, so it makes zero sense for them to move to the city when they have family back home, i mean what do their parents think? and do we need this many characters this time around? Again would make sense to just have the family trio and OG busters, Gary makes sense being here because he is in a relationship with Callie now.
I would surely watch this.
빰빰 빠밤빠 ~ 빠~~~ 밤 !!!    고스트 버스터~ ~~~
how heavy are the LGBTQ++ contents ?
So glad they’re not making a sequel with Leslie Jones
Can’t wait for this 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Wow, 20 million views in 13 days. That's quite rare for a movie trailer these days. Ghostbusters brings me an unspeakable happiness 👻🚫
It’s not a cast of gay black women? Wow something actually original
With kids, are you kidding me.
stock music, stock graphics... smh
Music nya sekilas mirip di Trailer Ant Man Quantumania
Another woke movie lol
tonight's forecast a freeze is coming
Wokebusters ruined their franchise.  It could have been a money-printing machine.
Smh another remake. Hollyweird is so lame
The intro to this is such a vibe with the sunset and Cruel summer playing in the background... and this has an amazing cast... best trailer from this year so far 🧊🌫❄️
They've done a good job in reviving this cult classic
Dude that beach would be literally filled with blood and guts from those pieces of ice falling from the sky
The more i watch this trailer the more i want to see it 😏
I’m sorry but what was he, Santa at the end??😂😂😂
And I thought I seen it all...Hollyweird..has gotten lazy and repetitive....zzzzzzz..zzzzzz
some of the animated series have great episodes that I wish could've been turned into movie, probably a bit of comedy will help too, imagine using the new generation of Ghostbuster featured in them, else, it'll be just nostalgia like every new star war movies. ahem please don't make comedy like female ghostbusters,
Please don´t be woke, please don´t ne woke, please don´t ne woke, please don´t ne woke, please don´t ne woke ...
Annnnd another fail
They should stop......
Love it! Lol reminds me of the old Sega Ghostbusters game where there was a ice ghost stage!!!
Hmmm, Ice 🧊 and ghosts 👻 not really a combination that works 🤔
The idea of this movie is that 5+ million people froze to death from fear and the movie is going try to be a comedy?
NOPE. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I'm really excited for this! Really enjoyed afterlife and this looks like a great continuation of the story. Iooking forward to seeing this on the big screen and adding it to my dvd collection 😁🤘
1:28 So Death Chill is male?
unspeakable garbage
This and the last one seem like decent entries into the franchise. The remake with the snl cast was quite poorly done sadly,
Like izlenir ❤
No, please!. Not another movie with those kids!.
I'm not sure I like the IP being used to do bland "marvel-scale" city wide death scenes. It feels like tacky IP abuse.   To me, Ghostbusters are classic comedies but this one feels like stranger things the movie.  When a Ghostbusters trailer is filled with orchestral hype, you know its not filled with amazing dialogue 😢  It won't be bad, but it won't be memorable 😕
Not Peter Quill laughing like Santa in July 🥶😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ㅠㅠ 잘 안되겠다 예고편만 봐도 .. 이건 아니지
Hold on if Gozer was the leader of the ghost and she got defeated then who is the new leader of the frozen empire?
Awesomeawesomeawesome!
That will get rid of the illegals...
Love the usage of Cruel Summer for the trailer
I really hope this is good!
😮Its been a long time since I e been surrpised by the reveal of a trailer to a movie i liked. I usually know from visiting the Wikipedia page multiple times. This one caught me off guard and I love it.
Hope see more Egon . This movie going be good one
YEEEEESSSS!!!!!! Venkman, Stantz, and Winston!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I thought the Ghostbusters were women now
Is that Lissandra? 1:50
Please please just stop already.
дрищи против глобального похолодания
I love how this is the most viewed video on the Ghostbusters YouTube channel, I physically can not wait for this movie. I've had the poster of this movie as my lock screen for months. Die-hard Ghostbuster fan.
Ruined the franchise along time ago smh
Haven’t heard cruel summer in a straight decade
Hyped
Let it go 😄
Finally! A movie I'm looking forward to watch in the cinema.
They need to make it gay and make it lame.
What is more scary than ghosts and actually scaring kids today...climate change 😢
Glad to see that fighting the upside down translated into experience for his future job as a ghostbuster.
Lets hope this is better than Afterlife
This looks dope
This instantly reminded me of the gigantic cloud ghost from Extreme Ghostbusters: Back in the Saddle (part 1 and 2)
This is why movies are flopping!...😂...make NEW things, stop with the refried beans trying to cash in on nostalgia.
Afterlife was a great way to transition to a younger group of Ghostbusters, glad they had the foresight to continue the storyline with the same cast!  McKenna Grace's song "Haunted House" is exceptional, I'm still listening to it should have been a top Billboard hit!
Ждемс)
Gotta face the fact they will never be able to recapture the pure magic of the original and judge this on its own merits.
Ayo! Where all the women busters at? 😁
Let it go, let it go~
My ghost just left my body
następne dżenderacko-feministyczne GÓWNO?
put a chick in it and make her gay!
Yeay!!!!
Cowabunga! cant wait to see this 🐢🍕👍👻🚫
Stop trying to make fetch happen
Yawn no thanks
We hunting all ghost
Looks awesome. Please remove all the parts with Paton Asswalled, and it will get a much better rating.
Make a new movie !!!! Stop with remakes
Not a fan of Patton Oswalt but this looks ok
Ghostbusters vs The Night King
finally... a real movieeeeeeeee :)
Не такое г не смотрим
первый фильм с детишками был по сути просто кучей отсылок на настоящие фильмы по охотникам. а на что будут отсылки в этом фильме? на женщин - охотниц за привидениями? лучше бы просто сняли экстремальных охотников с  живыми актерами. там как раз все персонажи по повесточке- как вам всем очень нравится. и при этом не говно, а шикарнейший сериал.
0:29  "What is that?"  "It's... bad CGI.."
For the love of God. Don't F this up!
"Let it go, let it go, I'm one with the wind and skyyyy"
Ughhhh
So is this going to be woke garbage, they going to cram it full of political key points, , throw in insults to maga, or is it going to be just a old fashioned good family entertaining movie for everyone?🤔
Love it, hope it's as good as afterlife, it was a ripper and as good as the 1st 2
Patton Oswalt and Kumali Nanjiani will end up being part of the new Ghostbusters team for future films like Paul Rudd did. Why else would they specifically have well known comedy actors in the film and part of the story unless they were going to be utilised later down the track?
Again repeating the bad formula with the Crystal kiddos Ghostbusters?? Ohh wait there´s Bill Murray!!
3 из 10 оценка...
Oh it has that Zionist bigot in it. Not gonna watch🤮
Paul Rudd is all of us
Im so happy they totally scrapped the all female garbage.
We’re in good hands. The director for this one also directed Monster House
I can’t get enough of this trailer, it’s so well done, not to revealing and hooks your interest
why cant they just leave this movie alone
I absolutely despise reboots. It’s basically a pathetic attempt to appease the masses and make more money.  BUT Afterlife and seeing this trailer.  No constant attempts at creating nostalgia, only an original story line with old faces from the past in the story. Absolutely BRILLIANT!!
I'm looking forward to a new film, but can anyone tell me why they have teenagers putting their lives on the line here?  Are there no adults capable of doing the job?
I like the fact that the plans to have a passing of the torch movies is finally occurring., Its a good base to open future more current culture films. Afterlife was slow but it helped get a basic origin story for the next gen handled, resolved some old conflicts and got it out of the way so it would drag in this one. I hope.
this looks even more cool that the very 1st movie.
Looks like they brought the ghostbusters multiverses together. I ain’t see Lisa Leslie though. Even though she’s a comic; put some respect to her name.
when i stop seeing black people placed in movies just to hit a quota for diversity ill watch a movie coming out. every movie you def have to see a colored person shoved down our throats
Looks cool minus Patton Oswalt. That guy is a creepy chud pedo
Awesome !!!
yoo
I can't believe they came out with all these females ghostbuster before. That turned out horrible
looks like its for kids, doesn't look terrible but not a fan of patton oswald at all. no reason to put him in anything he isn't funny or a good actor.
Mr freez
Cool! I hope Stay Puft and Slimer make their appearance.
Who you going to call ghost busters
❤❤❤❤
Хуетаааа!😉
Ghostbuster: The day after tomorrow
Why in the hell did they find the need to inflict Patton Oswalt on this franchise?
winter was like NO I AM NOT GOING TO END YOU CAN'T STOP ME
Ecto 1 is comming !!! 👻
White walkers?
Oh god,just let it die already…
Cool!
Dedicated to the Memory of Ivan Reitman
finally ,no woke bullshits
I think I just came
Hahahaha remember that god awful all female remake they ruined this series with? Guess theyre trying to redeem themselves.  I think ill just torrent the originals and rewatch them instead
IT GOOD
Onde assistir
I don’t recall the original being so … dark. It was so very campy which was fun. Am I missing something or is there something wrong with that?
What’s the opening song😭😭😭
mhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Man Paul Rudd has aged so horribly!
Yes!!!!
sale Elsa y dice "libre soy, libre soy..."
Yes please I love ❤Ghostbusters ❤
lame just like the last one. I definitely won’t be watching this.
Did they remember that Ghostbusters is a comedy this time?
OMG! That looks so woke! I'm so exited!
So am I the only one who got Day after Tomorrow vibes from seeing this trailer and who the hell is this new guy the litch king🧐
I'm so looking forward to ghost busters 4
WE MAKING IT OUT OF THE CROSS RIP WITH THIS ONE 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
OMG A NEW GHOSTBUSTERS MOVIE
Looks awful
Where is the Ecto 1A
Hahahaha they womanised it! What a piece of crap this will be now.
I can’t wait !!! Although, I must say, putting the Ecto-1 in the trailer whipping around with the siren blaring seems a bit gratuitous now.
Why am i laughing with paul rudd along way gosse bumps. Saving the day SAVING THE DAY
Back in the Big Apple
:o
boring
I love it
Great another franchise their going to ruin
Better then this Feminized Crap. This looks OG
great cast and potential, but the CGI is terrible. what the hell has happened? it looks like a low very low budget movie.
IM SAMA???
What Star Wars should’ve done
HOW THE HECK DID I NOT NOTICE THIS 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
OMG NO. JUST NO.
как всегда кал
Please be woke!
I’m actually kinda looking forward to a movie for the first time in years.
Not a fan of the whole ice angle, I fear they go overboard with the vfx. That was the good thing in Afterlife: They had some effects, but that wasn’t what completely carried the film and it’s story
So stoked for this movie I will actually go see it in theaters
Meh
let's gooooooooooooo
I want to see a slimer cameo
Quien no tubo una polera de ghostbusters 🎉
Ant-man 4 top
Nice 👍🏿
And we never speak of the year between 2015 and 2017 that was scrubbed from history.
Like a father frost
The trailer actually looked super interesting and I was 100% engaged up until the moment I seen the Ghostbusters symbol. 😶
Cant you just let the franchise die in piece..  Youre not gonna improve the original recipe, and you know it.
I am very interessted about, how many disliked that Trailer had^^
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa let’s go baby!
Paul Rudd, ladies & gentlemen! 😂😂😂😂
Жду с нетерпением! 😁👍
I assume that was Carrie Coon as Callie Spengler!  so Eon's Daughter joins the ghostbuster group.  I guess that would give the family a reason to move to NY. But we see Podcast so does it start in Summerville, Oklahoma?  but we only see Phoebe, Trevor, Callie and Gary Grooberson  in uniforms and with proton packs.
Elsa ?? What's wrong with you??? ❄️🌬️
Shut Up and Take My Money !!!
WAIT THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS REALLY GOOD AND ORIGINAL!!!
About time, show some respect to the old cast! 👻
Nice....
when?
WOW this is so NOT ghostbusters! they need to Batgirl this s**t NOW!
Somebody please tell how the hell did bill Murray agree to another ghostbusters movie
I’m so hyped for the iconic Time Square scene that’s in EVERY Sony movie where there’ll be nothings but ads for PS5, Coke, Sony Vaio computers, and of course, Papa John’s.
wait where's the signature music?
Wow, it’s like Ghostbusters meets Frozen 🥶 👻
Back..
looks like skinny kids ain't got no idea how and enough strengh to hold the plasmaguns but are already saving the planet) Nice work)
So elsa
Супееер!!!!
Let me guessQ the original ghostbusters will have like 3 mins of screentime total.
So I guess we have reached tropic thunder spoof tier. Sigh.
Are the VFX finalized? Because... yikes. That's some Sega Saturn cutscene level there.
Please live up to the hype. I’d rather watch the original for the 1000th time, than to waste on second of my life on a film that doesn’t respect the fans.
Where's Leslie Jones?
So Cool !
Now this looks pretty cool 😎😎
Samhain?
Now this one looks good
Wow.. just.. wow. Love the premise. Lóved to see 'mom' fully integrated. I watched 'Afterlife' sooo many times. Her final hug with her misunderstood ghost-dad, still brings me to tears. Sùch a great farewell to Harold Ramis. And now a whole new generation. I'm really looking forward to it.
I’ll be watching 🤗
it's cold outside
1:27
yes this version of GBis the sequel ive been waiting for. Loved the first one. No brainer im watching this!!!!!
Finally a new villain and an original concept I'm a 47-year-old fan I remember watching the original Ghostbusters in the ghost lady in the library scaring the bejesus out of me and I've been hooked ever since the last couple movies hasn't been all that great but this looks very promising
No. Thanks.
Is that Elsa?
(pounds money on table) HURRY! Also, I'm sooo happy that Mr. Murray is continuing to invest his time into the movies! How could we encourage Rick Moranis to show up?
When it is release😊
Well, I haven't seen Afterlife, but it can't possibly be worse than the 2016 movie, so it's got that going for it.
diversity is not our strength
Это мы смотрим
Take note studio's, this is what you do with a franchise. You pay homage to your original source material and add something new. You don't try and cram some sort of message into your movie, just tell a story, simple as.
It should've said from the director of poltergeist.
❤einfach das geilste für das es sich endlich wider lohnt wie zu den guten alten zeiten ins kino zu gehen und frohe weinacht
Not been a good ghostbusters movie since the origenal 2 movies . Every spin off movie since is either woke crap or just garbage
0:50 is that the spook central building from the original film??
Brilliant remake, looking forward to the movie.
ok BUT WHERE IS SIGOURNEY
For some reason I cannot trust another Ghostbuster movie after the 2016 mess. This looks decent but it is just a trailer and it could be in actuality made for "modern audiences" and have "the message" but it might just hide it. I feel completely disillusioned with Hollywood and don't expect anything good anymore.
YEEEEES! THE BOYS!
Who you going to call?
Ghostbusters has finally made an original sequel
Short trailer sometimes will be good movie, nice
Can’t wait for this one!
Can’t wait!
Hearing Ecto-1s siren 🚨 was EVERYTHING!! ❤
Never got into Afterlife....but this looks cool, they got the old cast back
Let it Ghost, Let it Ghost 🎵
I almost get tricked I saw Rick Moranis in a second there
Hello, Dima Maslennicov
Шляпа
Jack frost must be the villain
Winter is coming
This gonna be a classic movie
Something strange in the neighbourhood who you gonna call    Repeat the comment
Elsa?
James Acaster! Hell yeah!
I'm so excited that Patton Oswalt is going to be in this!
With the way the ice formed itself.......... whoever they are facing He already knows the ghost busters are a threat......... yet didn't destroy the building This implies many thing But this, it's a callout "I Know You Exist, And I Want You To Face Me" I'm willing to be considering the storm came from the sea, the ice, and how purposeful it all shows itself to be This screams viking, this screams Norse And only one Divinity I know of who fits the bill A ruler of ice, the dead, and can frighten someone to death, and the slightly feminen yet Uncanny silhouette Hel Hels coming to Manhattan, just as vikings once visited north America once Oh boy
Hope Slimer is back at the Firehouse, he's part of the family
John Landis inspired: Ghostbusters, Trading Place, Coming to America... Fun and original comedies. Unfortunately, this is exactly the opposite but it is perfect for those who realize that it is raining only because their smartphone is getting wet...
forget ghostbusters 1, 2, and 4, this is the best
Wondering if there's still a frozen connection to the game, I've been looking for Alyssa Milano uncredited cameo since afterlife
HELL YES
Coming soon Jesus, are you ready? I am the WAY, the TRUTH, and the LIFE (JESUS). No one comes to the Father (GOD) except through Me. John 14:6 Jesus died for you. Believe and repent today!
Are the Ghostbusters children? I’m confused.
1:51 Now that is cool
I hope this isn't going to be another load of crap like the last few versions.
"Afterlife" was actually pretty good - and this looks very cool (pun intended) - way better than 2016's "Woke Busters"
Not a woke film I think.
Cold Ghostbusters
Can't wait 😍
These appear to be the same folks from the last one…that was one of the worst movies in history…I couldn’t even finish it…are these some of you out there that liked it and why? Not being sarcastic…just curious? And are was all excited about the Godzilla movie coming out this month? I just found out and I’m SOOO excited!
Espero que no la caguen,cómo la anterior
I'm sorry but is it a "Fighting Elsa" movie?
🔥🤯🔥🤯🔥🤯🔥🤯🔥🤯🔥🤯🔥🤯🔥🤯
This is a little to far from the spirit of the original 2 movies
Heck yeah can't wait to see it
Bro finally a good new and original idea
they lil gang wins at the end what else..
Now this is how you make a comeback. Respects the original, but is on it's way to becoming the next big franchise in its own right :) 😍👻😍
Омагад омагад 😂
Hopefully patton oswald has a small role
Elsa?
Afterlife is easliy my favorite ghostbuster movie but now the original cast of afterlife?!!? Holy
"I wanna tell you my secret now." "Icy dead people."
Love it¡¡¡
Please no!!
Remember when Ghostbusters was another Harold Ramis comedic commentary about classism with an fantastical twist of ghosts for spectacle?
I LOVED Afterlife and cannot wait until Frozen Empire!!! This looks amazing...
Wow Ghostbusters on Ice!  Fun!
Not another ghost busters movie the all female team was better.
Another needless $equel
YES, AND THANK YOU!!!!!! GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
Please stop.
the crisis of screenwriters
Они издеваются над классикой ((, зачем снимать такой треш
WOW ...  AWSOME ....  I MAY NOT WATCH IT....
this will be a hit movie
I'm so there!
ThoseBastards
Can't wait!!!
This actually looks good. They need to ditch the old car though. There's not a single car on the road from the 90s these days. Thanks Obama
Sorry to burst bubbles but not an original bad guy only difference is vego fed off of hatred this 1 off of fear the end should be the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse vs ghostbusters  just a thought and EGONs spirit helps somehow or the other spirits help out someway
Murray looks bored.
This movie looks pretty cool.
quando eles tentam forçar colocar uma mulher isso deixa o filme chato !!!! esse filme teria que ser feito do jeito que o antigo foi !!! por isso os novos filmes est]ao saindo muito ruins !!! e est]ao todos flopando !!! criem novos filmes e coloquem so mulheres !! madame teia !!! pode ser que seja um filme bom !! pq ele so tem mulheres e desde a origem foi assim !! agora ja pensou se fazem um game of thrones e a principal adenerys agora for adenor !!! iria ficar horrivel e chato pq é forçar o publico a gostar de lacração e ideologia !!! panetra negra flopou pequena sereia flopou peter pan flopou as marvels flopou !!! quando eles vão aprender que nao se mexe com os classicos !!! coisas ja escritas nao tem que ser mudada !! ja pensou se eles mudassem a historia em the last of us e nao tivessem nem lesbicas e nem gays !!! queria ver se o povo iria gostar !! nem eu iria gostar pq iria estar fora do original !!! ninguem gosta de historia fake !!! ninguem !!!
Lissandra vs Ghostbusters
So woke, gonna go broke.
They should use the original script idea for Ghostbusters 3 for the sequel to this one , one on ice the other on fire
Yeah. This looks lame. RIP Ghostbusters.
Sooooooo excited the OG's back again!
Yooo this actually feeling like a real Ghostbusters movie. The last was good enough to wash the 2016 taste away but this looking like a real sequel. Props to the editor of the trailer.
So ghostbusters with women didnt pan out  it was a flop ,so lets try children . !!!
There are only 2 Ghostbusters movies and we all know it.  Woke garbage is begging for pennies through the lens of "diversity"
the last 2 decades of entertainment has been 99% worthless
hmmm why not🤷‍♂, Afterlife was good but this one i don't know
Love a bigger team, old and new, male and female.
I AINT AFRAID OF NO GHOSTS
Reminds me of Danny Phantom cartoon series ..hell yeah this movie going to be a blast🔥
Looks like apparation
😊🎉 they're back! All of them.  So cool. I can't wait 🥰😁
this gonna be good movie
Can’t wait!!!
Ghostbusters...fighting against....the cold....I can't say that anything in this 'Teaser' made me want to rush out and see this film...it doesn't seem to have any of the style, spirit (or humour) of the first 2 films. It looks like another cynical 'Franchise' cash in that has virtually nothing to do with the original concept. It's a generic movie that's been badged up as 'Ghostbusters' as a cost saving lazy marketing trick IMO.....Like walking into a McDonalds that only sells McDonalds branded soap....
Love it!👌 And they kept Ecto 1 new drift preferences just like it should 😜
I CANT WAIT!!!!!!!

No thanks. You can keep this one.
i love this children...just like watching Harry Potter but in technology form to catch creature. Can't wait for this movie.
"Who gonna call?"
где знаменитая музыка к фильму, что за фигня...
I'm super excited!❤
Make a Lego ghostbusters sets and a game please
Guys, what if the Ghostbusters were cold?
They should make a movie out of this
I think they should stop making Ghostbusters and quit destroying it
are they gonna meet valak ?
I'm in
its amazing to see bill murray again
oh hey more remakes and cgi
What happened to all the female cast ghostbuster
bill murray your so so cool, your the father of ghostbusters from rachel wallace australia lmao
Билл Мюррей будет присутствовать это значит фильм будет отличный
Да ну нах я пойду в кино на это
I thought I saw Kate Mckinnon
Yes. More GB movies set in the original universe. Thanks Sony.
Fingers crossed please let this villain be scary for real and not joke scary.
Patton Oswalt is cringe, man I hope they don't rely on him for the comedic bits.
I don't know.  It just seems like they are jumping the shark, again.
I am so glad they finally brought back the original cast.
OK first off, they’re being scared to death. You don’t need to say the word literally, you don’t need to spell it out for the audience. We can see with our eyes that they are dying, so all you need to say is they’re being scared to death. The audience can put two and two together, hopefully, and can internally recognize that they are in fact, being scared to death literally. Also, when the big bad guy sneak peek at the end is revealed, Paul Rudd’s comedic response nullifies any sense of actual threat or impending doom. Yes, it’s essentially a comedy, but the original had moments that were genuinely pretty creepy and scary. You need to have those moments.
Hob Anagarak? Possibly?
Great! Good to see some of the original cast. Hopefully this will make up for the box office bomb Ghostbusters 2.
They need to stop
Okay, This look amazing y’all
Fantastic!
Afterlife had me crying so hard at the end, it paid homage to Harold Ramis beautifully. And it revived the saga with a cool cast. Rudd is quickly becoming one of my fave actors.
Pure nostalgia I count the days to see the hair movie
So where is the original soundtrack?
paul rudds laugh here was amazing
My childhood is back.
James Acaster 🖤
I am so hyped!Really cool!!
Looks like a laugh a minute
Elsa went on vacation
I predict a 38% on Rotten Tomatoes.
So children are going to be saving the day again it seems. Not a fan, will be giving this one a hard pass.
Where's Peter Venkman?  There's always room for jello!😂❤
I like the idea of the Ghost Busters handing the business over to a new generation, but It's sad that it couldn't have used the Extreme universe. Would be interesting to see a live action movie of Kylie, Roland, Garrett, and Eduardo. And after all the ensuring there's female protags, they skip over the possibility of also depicting a handicapped protag (Garrett). Definitely gonna watch this, but I will be disappointed by the lack of wheelchair stunts.
Bro this is gonna be sick!
Arthas been real quiet since this trailer dropped
Already too much CGI !😎👎👎
Hopefully this won't be CRAP like the one with BROADS from 2016😑
Everyone will be rocking those red ghostbuster jump suits next year for Halloween
I wonder if they tell you how people died from the onslaught of flying icicles! If it was real life they would do a press release and also if this happened the last people I would call is the ghostbusters! Surely they have competition from a different company, maybe called ghost-catchers
WHO'S YOU GONNA CALL?  911 ❌ Ghostbusters✅😍😍🔥🔥
New storyline, new ghosts, new equipment by the looks of it and new characters got a good feeling this movie is gona be good
Ace of base ❤
Way brutal than GeoStorm
cANT WAIT O SEE IT! wILL IT BE WITH new ghostbusters or with the kids from the previous movie?
Why do people keep hiring Patton Oswalt?
Cool, keep it up Marvel!
I'm just gonna go see this movie for 1:52  Seriously, Paul Rudd can sell anything these days!
Looks absolutely absurd and a little dumb, cannot wait.
Another woke garbage. No thanks
This is not a teaser. This is a trailer. A teaser would be showing the ghostbusters logo and then having the ice sweep over it with the words "coming soon"
Check out our channel for the best movie reels ❗️
I encountered a massive black bear in Tennessee that definitely gave me the death chill. My blood ran so cold I was frozen stiff. True phenomenon!
I feel bad for the older cast. Let them retire in peace
Prepai your gear.  Dust off your nuclear accelerator.  Here we go again..!
Ohhh this looks really cool. I'm on board!
Columbia Pictures Presents, In Association With Bron Creative, An Ghost Corps Production, A Gil Kenan Film, Starring Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt, Celeste O'Connor, Logan Kim, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, And William Atherton, James Acaster / Emily Alyn Lind, "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (2024)" Rated PG-13 For Parents Strongly Cautioned, Exclusively In Movie Theaters Friday, March 29, 2024.
Скажу что первые части топ! Остальное шляпа
I love how diverse it is and the way the movie says how cool it's own premise is. "OMG SO COOOOL LOL!" Mr Freeze from Batman and Robin would even cringe at that one.
Atp Ghostbusters franchise>>>marvel
I'm very that woke culture is gradually being left behind.
This looks great the very concept of it, and I hope that they don't try to make it too funny and keep some serious dread associated with it as in apocalyptic horror, and keep it scary after all there's nothing funny about the world freezing over and people dying instantly. It would go with the saying Hell Freezes Over and that this planet Earth is actually hell anyway
Where´s the sooong !!!???  We want Ray Parker Jr´s soooong !!!!
America 🤮🤮🤮
I hate Ghostbuster movie🤮
What's with Hollywood hiring boys who look like they famished ?
Just once...just once... I would love to see a movie...when DUMB FOWN people have common sense and run Not after but before...😎😎😎
Not the mom 😰 automatic L
Ok no problem they have Ant Man
They better not go woke again. Feminists ruin everything
looks like crap
Finally, originality. Not regurgitated crap without a clue for the story, like the last one.
Whaaaat?? Not another woke feminist PC disaster??
I literally thought this was a fanfic trailer where someone mashed up Ghostbusters, The Day After Tomorrow, and Stranger Things.
Anybody else expected Arnold Schwarzenegger as the big reveal?
d'altronde un franchise che non ha mai smesso di funzionare, nemmeno dopo 34 anni dall uscita del secondo e ultimo ( vero) capitolo dei Ghostbusters, non poteva essere accantonato del tutto . apprezzo l idea di aver ripreso il salvabile e di aver riportato il tutto nei giorni nostri. e già la macchina dei soldini va avanti ...
I will watch this
Didn't realize this was coming so soon. Though I'm kind of depressed about the team-up of four here. It doesn't feel very iconic.
Shut up and take my money,  awesome.... can't wait
Can't wait to see it...
Damn I might actually have to see this.
Finally no more plot armour for side characters
Wow!...... this is going to suck
is it elsa?
Keren
wow i cant wait afterlife was sooooo good and now this looks the same yeeehaaaaa
Our Antman resurrected for Good! 👻
I would watch this😊
My god how many ghostbusters are they gonna make til they have ruined the original so much from these new ones
Hmm. We'll see 😮
40th Anniversary of the Original Ghostbusters next year and the 35th Anniversary of the 2nd. Wow.
WOW. Just two minutes of previously established tropes. Great job guys!
Literal chills.
WOKEBUSTERS!
There are at less a LBGTQ ghost in the movie??..
Hope it better than the previous one  That girl with the glasses was the most annoying character I’ve seen in a long time
Got a "The Day After Tomorrow" feeling there :p
New gen cast is terrible, i can’t believe how they ruined this masterpiece 🤦‍♂️
who did this? Elsa?
the nightking has returned after his weak demised in game of thrones
💩
Looks great except for Patton Oswald
Хорошо
I can't wait looks awesome
Ghostbusters Quantumania
With afterlife being weird and a little disappointing, I'm deeply concerned about this one as the trailer doesn't even make the movie look appealing.
Finally the frenchise return to its track! Smooth way to passing by the baton to new generation on the "Afterlife".
These new movies suck. No doubt half of you wear pajama pants on airplanes.
Not woke enough. Try again. Do better. Be better.
Plot twist Vigo is back
YESSSSS!!!!!! Evil Elsa 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
How about hearing "The ectomobile"
I’m glad to see everyone comments on how they grew up and how happy it makes them life is beautiful we all connected good to enjoy great movies
I love the music that's straight out of the real Ghostbusters! If you know you know!
I'm really glad Paul Rudd has the Ghostbusters franchise because who in the hell knew the one thing that could take down the Disney avengers was woke ideology! Captain marvel 2. Made 47 million every weekend and five nights at Freddy's was released on peacock and a theaters and has already crossed over the $250 million dollar mark. Why the lefties tried to sink it because oh my god, the director might be a manga supporter. What do we do?... I can tell you what we do. We support our own!
😊 f*** yeah, an original idea. I was cool with gozer is it a good way to write Harold Ramos out!
Not gonna lie, this trailer made this 46 yr old fan tear up seeing that Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson are coming back once again!, I'm so excited!!
I will have to see this!!  Looks awesome!
*sigh* not those kids again.....
they probably cant use ghost from the cartoon but the sandman was probably the scariest ghost, something about that voice made it scary. it would be nice to see him in the movie
Im a big fan. Can't wait to see it in the cinema.
I hope Rick Moranis shows up!
Elsa is coming ❄️
Nope
Que emoción, me tocó estar en la grabación que hicieron en Coney Island y estaba como fondo, así que me emociona verla y ver si me llego a ver por ahí leyendo en la playa 😂❤
Thanks movie ghostbusters 👻👻😱😱❤️❤️
Ghostbusters frozen empire 🎉🎉🎉2024
Damn this is awesome!
😱😱😱
A lot of people are brutally murdered in Ghostbusters 2023. WHAAAT!?!?
This movie looks like its gonna be great
Where is donkey kong when you need him, am I right?
Go away please, you killed it
The trailer looked excellent up until Patton Oswalt made an appearance. 🥴
Why wasn't original soundtrack used on the trailer😒?  It's my childhood song.
The nut job 3 raccoon revenge movie 2024
Assume
2024
Ghostbusters afterlife 2
Halloween movie 2024 Christmas movies Ghostbusters
Ghostbusters afterlife 2
Looks gay
Belly up to the trough for some more Hollywood pablum.
Yes if they do this I will be over the moon cause I love the Ghost busters movies and afterlife that was so well done.
Happy 100th Anniversary, Columbia Pictures!
If I owned the ghostbusters franchise. I'd make it dark and masculine. With some retro references. I know it's a fun film but I've always been a fan of ghostbusters. Just kinda wish it they would make it abit more serious and dark
Can’t wait
They chose the perfect person to helm this new trilogy in Paul Rudd.
So happy they are continuing from Afterlife with the OG Ghostbusters and Spanglers kids with an Original story. This is gonna be great!
Looks cartoony and fake in a bad and childish way. Not scary. Not very interesting. I don't understand what's going to be good about it.
I love that this movie didnt get a soft reboot for the 3rd time.
I love it, I love it, I love it INFINITY
Thank God the feminists are GONE.
I dont get how they are making another one after the last 2 turds they released
Garbage.
People complained that afterlife was the studio cashing in as they were using nostalgia which I disagreed with. With this looking good, Afterlife was perfect in a sense for the story to move forward with a new cast flanked by with the old cast and it works in my opinion.  With Cobra kai and now ghostbusters being written and made by people who are faithful to the actual franchise and not pandering to the woke nonsense etc, this is what we need more of as its the only way to appeal to both new and old fans etc.
Ghostbusters: Death Chill sounds like a better title
Tengo muchas ganas de verla espero que sea igual de increíble que la anterior
What is the song at the start of the trailer
OH HELLLLLLLLL YEA
Such a great trailer.
Looks promising.
Looks absolutely awesome ❤❤can’t wait to see it at the cinema ❤
Another movie!  What a treat!  Afterlife felt good, I expect great things from this one.
where is.... VIGO????
This looks great.
Finally a movie we can  unrestricted support and love. So cool and well made. For sure it will give trolls who find things to criticise, but I'm full of joy seeing this trailer for an Afterlife sequel 😍
Love the “scared to death” theme given the “I ain’t afraid of no ghost” ghostbusters tag line
Yes
I just watched Ghost Busters: Afterlife. I'm curious about what's next and YouTube then. I didn't expect that this trailer was only released 6 days ago. awesome
I don't know if I could have come up with better actors to add to this franchise following Afterlife than Patton Oswalt and Kumail Nanjiani
not gonna lie i almost said no to considering this movie when it looked like Kate McNotalent (McKinnon) was in it.  I may just wait to be safe.
Great another movie we never wanted..ugh this is out of hand remake garbage like everything else that's came out in past 10yrs.
Song?
The premise seems a bit dopey. But I really like the new characters and actors.  I’m actually glad to see Rudd get to be a Ghostbuster.  He feels like he’s playing it for all of us 80s kids.  With awe and reverence.  Great to see the old characters are still around in this one again.  That’s how to pay proper homage.
I'm not even slightly getting my hopes up. Can't be disappointed after that...
Hmmm… 🤔
So, basically, Elsa has PMS...
Who am I gonna call?
Elsa meets darkside
Ghostbusters 1, Ghostbusters 2 , Ghostbusters Afterlife and now Ghostbusters Frozen Empire,  4 (FOUR) amazing Ghostbuster movies!! what a treat.
I hope they dop better with the next commercial. This one is terrible. The death description being read is well written. Seeing the cameos is nice, but Finn Wolfhard's proton blast scene looks sad and cringeworthy. The last scene may show them all together... but not in an iconic way.
As long as this rendition is not woke, it will make waves..good ones.
Looking forward to this, def enj0yed the first one. But! Keep the woke garbage out of it for f sake
Gooooooooooooooooood.
Please dont be some kind of climate change activist ghost.
Bring back a Bobby Brown song and a little spot in the movie and 😮  oooh my this movie or any movie would be just as classic as classic  could be ... 😊😂
ELSA
Frozen Empire sounds like some RPG games and not movie title
Yeahhh!!!
Oh boy oh boy oh boy
I'm in for this one.
Nice
Ominous
Busting Makes Me Feel Good!
YES YES YES
Better be a slimer. I bidded on the animatronics from the first movie . I will own one!
Bleh.
cool, I'm down!  Why is it that when I hear Ecto-1's siren, I get the chills down the back of my neck and back??
If I'm not mistaken it seems the plot of this movie was inspired from an episode of The Real Ghostbusters, the name of the episode escapes me. But it's great to see they're drawing inspiration from the animated series!
Oh my god🎉
❄️ ❄️ ❄️
Please, please, PLEASE, let the Boogeyman be in this movie. Egon's dead, but maybe his grandchildren are as afraid of the Boogeyman as he was.
I sont know where this train of people saying not to have noatalgia.  Please bring nostalgia to the old ghostbusters all the way!
Cmon what the hell are y’all doin.. it’s wayyy to early to make ANOTHER GHOSTBUSTERS after the absolute train wreck and trashcan juice of the last one. I mean that last movie kinda absolutely obliterated the franchise. I mean for y’all’s sake and for the love I had for the originals I hope you succeed and don’t 100% completely fall off and lose every bit of love trust and Credibility
Weak
Love it can’t wait for it
Intriguing...most Intriguing 🤔
At first, I thought this was just another climate disaster movie.
AAAAAAAAAAA YES I love the ghostbusters movies
In a time when movies are aren't good, Afterlife actually was. I hope this is as good as that was.
Anyone else more excited for the RLM video than the actual movie?
I have seen that on ifdb ❤ 2024 and i'm so exited about that: wether it's Hellsgate nor Frozen Empire, i want it see in the Cinema. Ghostbusters 4  🚫👻🚫
Ooh nice. There's a movie?   When I saw 'Ghostbusters trailer', I thought maybe it's a game?  Didn't know they were making a movie.   Paul's laugh in the end pretty much sums up my feeling in the end. 😂
Norte sidin
This is turning into an every year one movie episode. I like it
The intro song is Cruel Summer by Bananarama.  You’re welcome!
Well this just turned into my most anticipated movie of 2024
Why only 4 likes
Afterlife was the movie that was focused on nostalgia now frozen empire is just a original movie i love it
Cruel summer is fire 🔥
👎🏼👎🏼
ANTMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
What a trailer...LIKE WOW, AWSOME SAUCE!!!😮👻
This is a cinematic masterpiece
I didn’t even know this existed until I saw the trailer 10 minutes ago, the trailer started playing as an ad and I was like, “What movie is this?” Until I saw the Ghostbusters building and Ecto-1 and all confusion faded from my mind. Already loved Afterlife and can’t wait for this!
This looks stupid and lame. Why are all these comments so positive?
Isn't that just the night king????
Everything seems petty cool. Don't even mind "the message" in this one..  but Patton Oswald? Didn't he OD his wife? Other than that, it looks great.... Will see in the theater.... gotta be better than in the Panderverse.... fact
I will be seeing this one in theaters. I think I missed out not seeing the last one in theaters.
antman, dinesh, billr murray, dan aykroyd, stranger things guy. im just gonna watch this one.
Piling stupid onto stupid.  Let it die.
Nope.
This is how to sequel/reboot a series. Well done.
Fortnite season 7 💀
Yes please! Give me something new!!!
Im hoping for a surprise cameo role.... call me sony... doesnt have to be a walk on role or with dialog. I could just hang around in a picture frame in the fire house. That'd be cool
Please no
I’m very excited for this movie. Nothing beats the original Ghostbusters movie but Afterlife did a great job of passing the torch onto a new generation of Ghostbusters and fans. That it looks like they are keeping the original Ghostbusters around for this one to train the next crew is awesome. This studio made a big mistake with the 2016 debacle but has shown that it’s willing to hear the fans and course correct.
Very fitting, as soon as Ray started talking, I got cold chills and goose bumps!
I *love* Ghostbusters, I was so excited for Afterlife from the first teaser trailers until the final scene. I so want to like this, but for some reason I can't put my finger on this is just not grabbing me... hopefully the next one will.
So it's The Day After Tomorrow, but with ghosts?
Ecto  is looking good!
I hope this one doesn't suck like the last two.
That’s definitely the wife from Everybody Loves Raymond 0:33!!!!
Sooo. What happen to Ghostbuster 2016? 🤣
NUNCA SERÁ O MESMO....  O QUE ACONTECE COM HOLLYWOOD
I’m glad I grew up in the 80s to see the originals when released. Almost everything is trying to recapture that nostalgic feeling.
Man, I don’t know.  Bill Murray was quoted saying what he didn’t like about the 2nd GB movie was all the reliance on animation, and the lack of character development.  From what I see here, the CGI looks worse than the second Matrix movie. Hope there is more polish to come.
What the heck?! I thought Afterlife was going to be the end of it all. I didn’t think they were going to go THIS far….  Let’s frickin GO!!! 🤩🥰
YESS FINALLY A NEW IDEAAA
Busters what a load off crap
Remember the first one was a irreverent blowjob comedy
Cole, Anthony
Future villain wishlist: 1. Samhain 2. The Boogey Man 3. Kestrel (from RGB) 4. Ragnarok 5. Sandman 6. Slenderman 7. Any original ghost with some historic lore.
At 1:40 I was thinking "Play the theme. Play the theme!" and they didn't play the theme and I was sad.
That classic ECTO-1's blaring siren is so nostalgic. I love hearing it again after a long time.
I am ridiculously excited about this film. I really, really enjoyed Afterlife; the sets, ghosts and overall feel was so satisfying and I just cannot wait to see where the franchise goes next.
The Frozen One is back from his ice bath...
Definitely be watching
you forgot Bill Murray in the Cast info guys :D
OMFG This is gonne be SOOOO EPIC
another woke movie to skip !! byeeee
Dickless coming back!!
Do you mean Exclusively in Theaters like it's not going to come out on Video or "no Digital Release" while it's in Theaters?
Happens release gozer by new villain free gozer
guess they're never gonna let it go
Can we just get Ecto Cooler with this release
What a joke! Woke Hollywood is just ruining the franchise.
You member?? I member...
Wait hold on a second is Sony making a GOOD reboot? Why on earth would they do that? I thought we were all committed to eternal garbage.
Hype is Real-
When will we get the real trailer And not the teaser
What will the running time be for ghostbusters frozen empire 2024
No...? Or maybe rather, why? That doesn't work twice, it was a one time deal. Do something new before you break it beyond repair.
I'm excited for this continue making movies
Finally a trailer that doesn't spoil the plot!
Something NEW, and not just rehashing / reformatting / rebooting. Yes PLEASE and THANK YOU.
What I see is Ant-Mant meets Kingo. LoL
Can’t wait 😊
I’m in….
What a fantastic cast especially having Annie Potts, McKenna Grace and Carrie Coon on board!!! Can’t wait!
I hope Brian Tyler composes this!
Oh. Jippie! Hier heb ik zin in! 🥶🩵
THIS is what Ramis and Aykroyd wanted for the Ghostbusters IP. This is what a legacy franchise should hope to become. Great cast, original new story, not a rehash, but a tribute in many ways to the originals.
This better be real
I’m excited for this movie! The representation in Ghostbusters is just fantastic and I love how the kids are still learning to be like them. Love how they also have the original cast members back too. An introduction for the ice ghost is definitely awesome
Why does 90% of these comments seem AI and bot generated...
Sniff.... WOKEland..
Bill Murray is the legend of this movie name. I miss him.
I thought they were done, and was assuming this would look really bad...but Patton Oswald & Paul Rudd could save it!  Plus who doesn't love Ernie Hudson?!  I'm in!💥🤞
Another sequel no one asked for or needs
Yaaaaaasssssss!!!!!!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!! my inner child totally freaks out like crazy! ♥
Why is it that every time the ecto 1 drifts and blares the siren...it makes the ecto 1 so badass. I love it
inspired by Game Of Throens fr
I didn't think they could combine ghosts with Ice, but they made it work somehow lol
Super excited about this !
Wokebusters: Social Empire 🤦‍♂️
Um. Pedo🚼🍕 File Patton Oswalt 🤬🤮🤢🥶 and no offense but... "They" said a big freeze was coming.
Estou animado para assistir!
NEW YORK
So Ghostbusters is some generic disaster movie now?
So cringe..
Ghost busters may have been one of the only franchises to do the passing on the torch correctly
When I saw Ghostbustes: Afterlife, I almost cried, not because it was sad or moving, but because it was a hollywood blockbuster that was actually good. In these days, it seemed like a miracle. This new one looks cool too. At my age, I don't have too many expectations, but I'll definitely watch it in the theatre.
That one with the brauds was like a skid mark in someone's undies
Glad the wackos over at Disney didnt ruin this one👍
Looks promising…I liked what they did with the last one👍
To many men as usual. 😂
My respects!
Wow this looks awesome! I am so hyped for this. You guys are doing so well with the reboots! I love the way you made afterlife follow the events of the original! I can’t wait to see the fire house again and the ecto 1 in the streets of nyc!!
1:10 he looks familiar
A proper new GHOSTBUSTERS BABY!!! YEAH!!!!!!!!!
Looks sooo cool. 👻🤩  Sorry, I had to do it. 😂
Is that Ray talking?? I thought he would be a lot older but it sounds like him. At least an original film rather than a remake, AND a new, never-heard-of villain!! Now this is something I can get excited about!! And did I see Ernie Hudson plus Paul Rudd?!?!
More Paul Rudd please
Y'all remember the forever Halloween night episode? I still don't understand how they got that pumpkin head demon in his wooden cage🤔
Remember, only 40 years ago we were afraid of an ice age.
Wow. A "Climate change'' narrative. Is Trump the evil demon behind it? Stunning and brave. Can't wait to see how much the studio loses on it, but that's all I look forward to with this unoriginal contrived dreck.
Elsa is the villain
What’s starting soundtrack ?
Doesnt look bad
Lol Ant-Man and the Frozen King🌨
Looks crap.
I'm confused.
Amazing....thats the 1st movie in 20 years I have wanted to see in the theater
Это самое лучшее что я видел за Сегодня..💜🌟 Я смотрел первую часть.. Жду с нетерпением вторую..🌟💜😈👻👻
Is it me, or as a grown man I don't want to see kids in these roles.  Takes away from it, we grew up on this and they are just making it TRASH!
Wow, that's amazing. ☺️
0:42 nice butt
This look...... .... *_COOL!_*
Please, guys, what is the name of song in the beginning ? Thank you kindly 🤝
Huh so Murray's actually showing up for these now
I'm genuinely looking forward to this :) That's a first for any movie in a long time.
Nope the original two and leave it there...
Somebody get me the Ghostbusters  This movies going to be radical
Just a little Sigourney cameo,  please 🙏
I have to admit that I like the new movies WAY more than the old ones. Legacy surprised me in a positive way and I hope this one here will do as well. I like the mentor-student-idea a lot, plus making it possible to go on with the franchise with new characters who actually have a backstory tied to the original cast
Marvel are you watching this !!!! Take notes!
Haven't finished watching, ghost shark, PLEASE GHOST SHARK!
Not even gonna lie, never did i imagine there would be a movie after Afterlife, it felt like it was the final movie,
Looks fun!
Paul Rudd’s laugh at the end…..😅😂 that’s everyone rn
1:21 This is gonna be amazing  Pray it wont suffer like 2 and 2016
Please stop ruining Ghostbusters more and more why did they make another one it's there no other dead horses for you to beat
OMGOMGOMGGGGGGG
What’s the song’s name?
I hope they do another trailer with the song, it's so iconic, everybody knows it, it should be on the trailer to hype people.
I mean this looks pretty good so far…
You guys can't get 209k on youtube Ghostbusters five 2024
I hope they don't ruin the franchise. I have fond memories of the previous installments.
Looks like this may be the first GHOSTBUSTERS movie to actually have a body count.😳
I thought it was going to be a Beverly Hills Cop 4 trailer until the cold transition showed up. I hope this continuation lives up the hype.
Our heroes, new heirs, for deeds
NEW VILLAIN GHOST!
SEE IT SOON
FANTASTIC🤘😝🤘
PHENOMENAL👍💪🤩
Gozer is back again again
Actually had to look this up to see if it was real and not some AI generated BS.  Glad to see Reitman’s continuing his father’s legacy with Spengler’s grandkids.
I have watched and own all Ghostbusters movies. Loved the rebuild of echo1 on YouTube. Plus the making of afterlife on YouTube as well. This is definitely a great direction.
Who you gonna call?
Cool seeing ghost dad made her a believer, cool seeing the gang back from the last movie
Could have an all female reboot, that would be awesome….
The real ice king that Game of thrones deserved lol
Afterlife was fantastic  great to see new cru and old
River of ice more like river of silme
Looks good!
I love the ghostbusters franchise (except the 2016 trash fire, that can burn in hell where it belongs), and like that it’s doing something original. But the one thing it didn’t need was more celebrity comedy cameos. I’m nervous it’ll just boggle down the plot.
This looks like a lot of fun! ❤
Im almost as excited for this as I am for Deadpool 3. Thank you Bill for coming back yet again! You are the Sean Connery of comedy.
who you gonna call
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!! I LOVE GHOSTBUSTER THANK YOU !!!!!!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🎉🎉🎉👋🎉🎉🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
They better not off Venkman and Winston on this one!!
SMH🙄YOU BETTER REPENT!JESUS CHRIST!IS ABOUT TO RETURN!VERY SOON!THIS IS WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN!TO YOU!IF YOU ARE LEFT BEHIND!
Paul's laugh at the end sold it lol.
Trailer-freeze is coming... Everyone-original villain... Me-Mr freeze Arnold schwarzenegger The audience- no way 😂
Its hard to tell the difference between Stranger things and ghostbusters lately.
Stop having kids save the world. What is this an anime?
Looks awesome, can’t wait to bring my kids to see it
The truth is out there, believe this gonna happen
So basically it gets as cold as living in tasmania every day, and the soft americans lose their minds?
Ghostbusters 4 yeah baby!!!
Well, Tony Pro was right. People are freezing to death in NY in summer.
This looks really good! Sony has been picking up they game lately
They should make the 2016 sequel so nobody watches it.
Hope they don’t forget, first and foremost ITS A COMEDY.
Jesus what a waste of money and time
Now it looks like something to watch
Hopefully it has the real Ghostbusters in this more and not just the little kiddies and THANK GOD they actually wrote an original story instead of taking Ghostbusters 1 (or 2), putting the script in a blender, adding little kids, removing the Ghostbusters from it and seeing what happens like they did with Afterlife. I guess I will check it out with extremely low expectations, but not in theatres. The last proper Ghostbusters movie was in 1989, why can't they just let the franchise rest in peace?
i tinck was geo storm 2
Damn this teaser is a really good trailer
wow so pumped.  superhero from disny and star wars from disney have exausted me.  this is so refreshing.
Ghostbusters was about some fish out of water academics of dubious skill and integrity making a blue collar business, but I guess CGI ice movie is also a way to desperately make a franchise happen as the industry realizes not everything needs to be the MCU.
FINALLY A GOOD MOVIE AFTER A DECADE OF BAD MOVIES. DISNEY NEVER EVER  SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GET HAND ON THIS. THEY WOULD RUIN EVERYTHING GOOD AND MAKE IT BAD.
Awesome !!!!!
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS!!!!!
guys climate change is so 2019, now it's all about that WW3
Winter is coming... Ghostbusters
Ghostbusters 4 looks crazy !! :D
That dark cloud instantly reminded me of the last episode of Ghostbusters Extreme Back In The Saddle. Seems this time around its going to be a huge stake since we see people getting offed here frozen.
Flish ralouse
Maybe there should be a ghost of a dead horse.
Too bad they put baby jabba in it
Liking and supporting if they go for original content and stories
It's cool and so on, but... remember for a second that extreme ghostbusters still have no ending.
Old meets new I love it now it’s a party
Whats that sound? Sounded like another slap in Leslies face.
Taking it back to where it all started!!! NewYork City!
Damn, crazy how every movie monster seems to immediately go straight to Manhattan.
😢 IT'S AMAZING
They still don't wear eye protection when firing their thingys??
They still don't wear eye protection when firing their thingys??
Boys..it’s time BOyS GET YOUR MONEY OUT SO WE CAN ALL GO PUT YOUR MONEY TOGETHER GO GO GO
Don’t like that Oswald is in the movie. Guy fing sucks
is this meant to be a sequel to the previous ghostbusters reboot? (the real one not the all women reboot) because thats so cool, i'm hyped
Amazing vfx 😮
Looks bad
Wooaaa so cool!
Here’s hoping Sony has just saved the LEGO ECTO1 from retirement 🤞
I wonder if they built a special containment unit just to keep Gozer imprisoned in it. Since he's a deity I can't imagine the regular containment unit would be strong enough to contain him.
Верните песню
Okay. Imma be honest, i didnt realize Aftermath was popular enough to get a sequel, but hell yeah, lets go!
Idk anyone who asked for this.
is that Antman??  Well tell him to suit up 😂😂
Dan Aykroyd still flogging that dead horse
Busting makes me feel good
Cool to see Nanjiani & Oswalt join the cast, but it might be fun if some of the actresses from the failed reboot could appear in some capacity in new roles. The issue was never (for most of us) with them personally, it was the direction the movie took.
🤦‍♂
Remember when you could freely say things like, "I'm not gonna watch this movie, looks bad" without being blocked and banned. I scrolled down and couldn't find one single comment that wasn't 100% supportive 😂  It looks like a bunch of robots agreeing with each other 😂😂😂
I didn’t even know this was happening. Looking forward to this.
Kel'thuzad: I am Kel'thuzad and I serve the Frozen Throne... Cough*... I mean the Frozen Empire  Anub'arak: ...The old lich need to follow the times...
L'unica cosa interessante di questo Trailer è il primo minuto, tutto all'insegna degli anni 80. Il resto da dimenticare subito.
as a true GB fan, I don't mind where it goes now, what they do because what I had waited 30 years for was complete with afterlife. To know the story still carried on is all a fan really needs. I love that we're getting new threats now. the only thing that's jarring is carrie coon as a ghostbuster because she was sort of the ditzy useless clueless mom in afterlife. If there's explanation for it in the script then it's fine. looking forward to this. who's the bad guy? Krampus? Jack Frost? lol
Why ruin your movie with Patton Oswalt ?
omg no....now way....
Fantastic they are using British staple Bananarama on this soundtrack too
This looks so good. I'm in!
I guess they can't come up with  a new concept horror movie... man I miss the 80s and 90s
Where's Podcast?
I cannot wait for this!!!!
Looks fun
Can someone explain the frozen empire title is it something from the past or ?
Вот это поворот))))
I done cried 😢
Should have left the ghostbusters alone.
❤
Cant they stop floggin a dead horse please?
Winter villain?  How original.   I'm sorry but having kids+a GB mom is just as bad as an all female GB team.  Didn't like afterlife, this probably will be worse.
Oh god no! Just leave it in the past now
Can't wait for this follow up
My YouTube channel selling
Wow
Yesss who ya gonna call!?!?!
Don't care what anyone says: I'm suiting up in full cosplay gear when I go see this opening week!
GONNA WATCH THIS..
They better use the theme song in the damn movie this time… so excited either way it looks new and different for them! 🎉
Around here we get worse than that every winter.
Baby ghostbusters vs climate change: they fixed everything destroying portatraits at museums, blocking roads and screaming "i have eco-anxiety"
So The Day After Tomorrow with Ghostbusters
Well just by seeing the trailer I know this is going to be better than that POS movie with the women in it
O.M.G ❤
Rest In Heavenly Peace Harold Ramos aka Egon🙏🤍🕊🙏♥️
Love it. Keep making great movies
Хорошо что Охотники за привидениями не пересели на электромобили😂 старый добрый бензиновый мотор согреет даже в апокалипсис 🎉
The beginning does capture quite well the feelings I had for 1984. Trips to Belle Isle in Summer; Tigers eventually winning....that sort of thing.
How you going to have a Ghostbusters trailer and not play the Ghostbusters theme…
Who are going to call the new ghostbusters.
super cool ! 🥶
After I saw Afterlife, I thought of the possibility of the OG Ghostbusters teaming up with the new ones!  I'm happy to see it's been done!  This looks awesome, and I'm very stoked to see it!
Yes! Yeeees!
Can't wait for this movie!!
I hope this will encourage the other studios to make more original story on the popular movie franchise...
Hopefully they do an all female remake of it LOL
so geostorm
Nice trailer ! Please don't wokeruin it.
excuse me while I go and reserve my ticket for this movie
This is real!! OMG... I'm so pumped! Loved Afterlife, never thought we'd get a sequel. Loving it!!
Does anyone know the name of the song that played in the beginning of the trailer? If you know please tell me!
Garbage.
Trailer has got me interested, even if the trailer’s music is doing nothing for me.  Literally every movie trailer sounds the same I’m sooooooo over it.
Please bring back Slimer!!!
Awesome! Afterlife was a breath of fresh air, can't wait for this.
Okay, I’m in.
I don't remember a lot of people dying in the older films. I wonder why they changed.
Is that Mike from stranger things
I just want one thing, Ghostbusters: The Return of Slimer!
So I would legitimately like to see a rated R Ghostbusters that is scary and without little kids in it
For all the new techs, the modern reimagination of classic favorites fall short so hard it hurts to watch. Lazy story telling. Lazy acting. Over-reliance on sound and visual effects to try to overwhelm.
This looks like a really great transition from the more nostalgia based first movie and an evolution into it's own franchise. Love it!
beware the kentucky fried man!
Looks good but patton oswalt is so annoying that I won't watch anything hes in
It's the plot of Frozen basically, Elsa's looking scary there at the end
So what happened to that 400 lb black gorilla they had in the all female cast?
I was all for it until i seen the main cast is a bunch of kids.
Bro i know its proplbably never happening but i hope this is rated 15 because the ideas for the villan and the death chill are way to cool to tone down.
Day After Tomorrow meets Ghostbusters
Cant wait
Cool
How does nobody get impaled by those suuuuper pointy ice shards!?
The old gang is back!
I hope the movie is better than the idea.
I miss gozer the gozerian 💜
You know, I love Ghostbusters just as much as Dan Aykroyd. But I'm not sure about this because this is Avengers level activities
I can't wait for the movie to come out. And from what I see, seems we'll have a "Mr. Stay puff" style fight
Hope there won't be easy boss fights, like in the previous movie.
LUL what happened to the female cast
I like that the original Ghostbusters had not become old sad fellows rotten on an island... Trying new ideas and characters with respect to the lore? Can't understand how they found a receipt for a movie I would like to watch.
Looks pretty good!
The original ghostbusters was the first film I saw in the cinema at 6yrs old. It had an enormous impact on me. It is still My favourite film of all time. I’m so glad that Sony is continuing this brilliant franchise.
I did not expect another sequel. I was fine with Afterlife. I am eager to see this next one.
1:09 bro sounds like Jesse from Minecraft story mode
Wow, can you imagine if Disney were smart enough to have done this with Star Wars?  Good job Sony.
Who you gonna call?
kids as lead roles rarely does well
Yes please! Can’t wait!
Let’s go, sooo tired of the DC and Marvel💩Looks like a winner🎉
This movie is gonna be a blockbuster! So the producers already should begin working on Ghostbusters 5!
I cant wait until the movie comes out.
This is going to be the best movie so far it looks like it is it looks like it’s an awesome movie but we’ll have to wait and see. Let’s see if afterlife tops this one but either way I’m still gonna love it I’m still gonna purchase it at least watch it once because I at least watch a Rico special movie once or million times if I buy them if I don’t buy the match just don’t watch them like the second one did not like that one but keep it of Ghostbusters you’ve been done you’ve done a lot for like to go to thought for.
WOW.. I’ll go rent the original again. Since as far as I care there’s only two Ghostbusters movies.
Please reupload Citizen Ghost, the audio cuts out completely halfway through the episode.
Well this looks... terrible :(
Does anyone know what that piano sound is from?
I will never get tired of that siren sound 😍
...no. Just no.
Na to není co říct-o5 je tu americká píčovina z americké kinematografie... oni snad ani netuší co znamená opravdu dobrej film 😂  jsou tak zahleděni do své krásy,že ani nevědí,že existuje i jiný druh filmu.
У нас в России каждый год так) Зима неожиданно настаёт в день жестянщика)
There is no way nobody in this movie dies from those spikes right?
I’m reading these comments in Jay and Mike voiceover. Still trying to make a franchise off of one good movie. Let it die!
Looks awesome. Hopefully they're not going the way of Disney and ruining it.
😀😃🤩 impactante,  interesante y obra maestra   Pensamiento aleatorio
So exciting
겨울 컵셉 좋네
gonna bring my kids to watch this awesome show!
Elsa is coming
Yooo antman is a GB now? WWW
Louis Tully should be the mayor of New York in this one.
I swear, if the villain turns out to be a white chocolate Hershey bar...(shakes fist)
Ok you DO NOT show it hailing giant ice shards if we don’t get to see someone get absolutely merked
ini film film pada lgng keluar semua, jadi bingung mau nonton aapaa
Men only in ghostbusters. its the one movie where actresses should be in the kitchen
The day after tomorrow vibe
This will be cute. I really liked the last one with my og boys in it, passing the torch. This one seems fresh.
stranger things at home
Oh this is going to be awesome
Can already tell this will be a million times better than the woke female version.
day after tomorrow with ghost ... 😍 count me in
Wokebusters: the day after tomorrow
Another crappy movie
People are frozen to death or just frozen?  GB was never about innocent people actually dying. The threat was always there but thats when the Ghostbusters would save the day. I really hope thats not the angle they are running with here.  Ghostbusters was like the A team...tons of action but no one actually ever dies.
I was hoping santa would be the villian
I'm praying for the universe to leave the Ghostbusters name dormant, it was never meant to be a Stranger Things kind of franchise, it was just a good movie and that's it. This is reaching Predator/Terminator levels of reaching and trying to make it relevant. To hell with franchises JUST HAVE A NEW IDEA.
Go away PEDOWOOD
Did Hollywood learn from their mistakes? I sure hope so 🤞
OTRO FRACASO MASSSS....TODO SE A PARA LAVAR GUITAAAA
BANANARAMA!!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Yes
Visually it looks really good. But I get put off by the blatant jokes that feel out of place in a situation that you would never joke like that in. At least not in this way. And the kids part. Children being the smartest in the situation just takes me out of the story. And I get it, people can say “it’s just a movie” but the first one just hit so perfectly I wish they would carry on the vibe as well as just showing the same props like the car and the trap and the logo etc. the vibe was created by the brilliant script and the way people talked to one another. It was genuinely scary even to this day, which it should feel like given what the danger is portraying. Anyway I will go see it regardless. Just saying this in hopes of having a conversation about it with like minded thinkers
I would loved if they used Hobankrat..  From the Real Ghosbusters.. set fire to the world.
Elsa how could you?
They ain't afraid of no ghost, but sure as hell are afraid of using the theme song again, eh?
Why are they still making this franchise?
Ice Busters
PESKY GHOSTBUSTERS !
Name of singing song intro please?
This gave me goosebumps, well done 👍
I love Ghostbusters I was 14 when the original came out and Afterlife wasn’t to bad the only thing I see so far with this one is Oswald or whatever his stupid name is he is so full of wokeness I can only guess how bad this might be with him in it
Super excited 🎉
LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!! Damn glad to see Winston again!
no way i thought this was going to be the origional cast i now they are in a little bit of it but now I'm well dissapointed
Unwatchable garbage. But thanks for the reminder to watch the real one from 1984 and never waste my time with this tripe.
Ghostbusters: The Day After Tomorrow
so it's CRAMPUS
....Winter is coming.
You can do a lot when the source material is respected. It knows where it comes from, and it has a better idea where it should be going.  It also has designs proper to the old ones, even if we start to see them evolve. Unlike that garbage in the Fig movie. You know like dumb ghost traps that have steel jaws with lights and ghost zappers just making ghosts vaporize left and right for no reasonable reason to the universe.  Fig shouldn't be allowed near any of these old IP's ever again and the lady responsible for us NOT getting a GB movie until she was able to get it destroyed just the way she wanted, cuz she thought she knew what was best, should be punted hard out of SONY and not allowed to make decisions on ANY movie franchise EVER again.
And then my day ended perfectly. Cant wait!!!!!
Looks like A Fun Ride!
Ok ! I'll see this one!
How have I only just heard about this????
I so can't wait for this! ❤️
It's a Marvel movie..... just with a different name.
Please stop making Ghostbusters movies. We didnt  need anymore after the first two.
Glad they brought it back.. the real original cast (miss you Igon!)!
I would do unspeakable things to see even a 5 minute Rick Moranis cameo in this.
How did you make the people freeze? How did you make the city freeze?🫢
Looks great!
Looked pretty good until about 1:08
Fantastic!
Is this real.. it feels like a joke movie
1:51 - I am the Dead of Winter.   From an unidentified character from an unknown game from an undisclosed game client.
Heck yeah love the follow on
Elsas' breaking bad
Ok so where do I buy the red GB winter jacket?!
Arthas?
Oh I'm so happy they stuck with the kids and not the cringe crew.
I'm so excited! I am so looking forward to this 😊❤
Can’t wait for Frozen 3
They should have filmed this in Britain this Summer just gone they wouldn’t have had to CGI any ice 🧊 it was the worst Summer here for over 70 years they said, I would totally agree bar about a week and a half it was raining and freezing cold 🥶  While the rest of Europe was roasting in 100*F +
Glad they got rid of Melissa McCarthy and the other women who were dreadful
Dave Collier would be a great ghostbuster
so lissandra from league is the main villain?
Why?😢
If it has Bill Murray…. i’ll watch it 👍
feels like donkey kong : typical freeze
Please don't put black bars on the videos; some people have ultrawide monitors. :)
Not woke enough. Better let Disney redo this one.
I just hope this film has not went down the Disney route and sealed its fate in the woke graveyard. Willing to give it a go though because some original cast members are back.
Looks interesting!!!!! 😮
I know this! That's a Hantu. $100 please.
Patton and Kumail in the trailer? They're just telling you it's going to have tons of woke moments injected into the film.
how does the black guy still look the same ???  wow
Looks cool.  Please don't have climate change messaging. I beg you.
As much as I love Ghostbusters, I didn't think they needed another movie 💀 still, an ice villian seems interesting. Hopefully this will be good bc I didn't like Afterlife that much
Yeah, the Ghostbusters are going to stop another Frozen sequel.
This is some Day after Tomorrow sh**. I like it.
It doesn't look like a Ghostbusters movie. Please do not ruin it.
Походу Снежная Королева пришла в гости.
Paul Rudd? Check. Bill Murray? Check. Dan Aykroyd? Check. James Acaster? Check. Wait, what?  What's Acaster doing in a Ghostbusters trailer 😂😂
This is literally the plot of the Loonatics Unleashed pilot, what the hell is going on?
Winter is coming
Definitely worth seeing.
Perfect trailer.
Phew...worried this was a new Mellisa Mccarthy......
One thing I don't like about this is how some of the characters act like they fans transported inside the movie gushing over "cool ghostbustery things" instead of reacting to these scary things like it was real to them! Let the audience feel those "that's cool" emotions on themselves, don't try to tell us that "now you're supposed to react with nostalgic glee". What made the original movie's comedy work was that the characters themselves were taking the ghosts seriously but commenting on it with quippy dry humor.
I have no hope for this. I wish I could but I have no hope.
I thought this was a spoof video- seems it's a real trailer!
Coney Island baby my home town let’s go shout to NEMS you heard !!!
Those ice spikes formed way too quick for those guys to be saving anyone but themselves. Looked like it impaled thousands immediately. Strange the effects segue into such a whimsically-charged atmosphere.
Can’t wait to see this
Wonder what Leslie Jones thinks of this?
I’m here for this. Love the trailer just enough. Also Paul Rudds Viggy Viggy Viggy laugh. Yes!
Stop hitting it, its allready dead.
I love this cast! This....this is what makes a good movie, just everything about this. I loved Afterlife , can't wait for this one! ❤
looks terrible
That looks terrible.
Hell Yeah, Let's GOOOOOO!!!
I was literally playing the old ghostbusters game like 2 days ago and just found out this is coming out what a Coincidence
Should the Ectomobile be updated? What do you guys think?
Looks cool but its annoying that they're mostly kids.
...oh and these effects are annoying
lol... 'death chill'...
I take it nobody got stabbed by the icicles because we don't see anyone impaled. ofcourse not! because that wouldn't be woke enough.
😊😊
Glad to see Ghostbusters getting returning to character with these last two films. That one in 2016 was stupid.
sorry, but the casting is not convincing
this looks dope. def will go watch
This movie is going to be sick!!!
Looks good
I’ll watch anything with Paul Rudd on it
1:00  great
Going by this trailer I’m gonna be happy if it manages to equal GB 2016….
Apart from the nostalgia nod, there is nothing noteworthy about this teaser.
Love the first 3 cant wait for the 4th,all of these are epic
put a chic in it and make it lame and gay.....
I dunno… This doesn’t have the same feel as the original movies, it feels like the Ghostbusters franchise got adopted by whoever makes all those Marvel movies (insincere humour included).  I like the originals for a reason, and it was not whatever I’m seeing here.
Patton Oswald? I'll pass.
Sony should make it rated R and have some of those people in the beginning get impaled by those ice spears. Afterall most of the fans of ghostbusters are all grown up now.
E😮
Damn. I even heard good things.   Nope. Looks like corporate made, hot garbage. Probably cuz of Waititi. Yuck
Leave the franchise alone guys
This movie looks fabulous and if it turns out to be a massive FAIL I *will* slap people…
This looks incredible. It's great to see that Peter, Ray, and Winston are in this. Some have said that this is in a separate timeline from the main story, which is incorrect. Here's the timeline; Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters 2, Ghostbusters The PS3 Game, Ghostbusters Afterlife, and Ghostbusters Frozen Empire.  It's probably safe to say that the 80's Ghostbusters animated series is cannon. And maybe Extreme Ghostbusters.  Thankfully, that abomination from 2016 that had the nerve to call itself Ghostbusters isn't cannon and will not be continued.
Can’t wait!
Let's hope this turns out better than the 2016 reboot...
Ok this actually looks good!!!😮😁
Do you want to build a snowman?😂
this is something new
Fun fact, this is gonna adapt the very first episode of Real Ghostbusters. They even stated they were drawing heavily from the cartoon.
Afterlife was excellent….so I’m looking forward to this. Sometimes reboots of classics often fall flat but I think this could be the exception.
Can't wait for this!!!!! 👻👻👻
Whens it out
Ernie Hudson won the age lottery compared to Dan and Bill LOL
Cool
Years ago they’ve said that whenever the new Ghostbusters movie is coming out it’ll be when hell freezes over. And it actually did freeze over.
Sad. They created a great movie in the 80’s and are going to keep remaking it and dragging it out until no one cares. Like Star Wars. 😢
I mean it could use more loud, annoying, female "comedians" but it looks pretty good.
Afterlife was so-so, not terrible (like that other movie we don't mention anymore), but also not great (imho). This doesn't give me chills ... but let's see what they actually do with it. My main issue with the trailer was the goofiness of it all. "Hey, the world is ending, but that's no reason not to insert a lot of puns and quips just for the giggles..." And I like Rudd, generally, but at least in the trailer he just comes off as Ant-Man 2.0. If you want stakes then you also need to be appropriately serious about it, not insert a joke every 2 minutes. If you want a light-hearted family-friendly Ghostbusters that's also fine, but then you can't have literal armageddon around.
So, being frozen to death due to being afraid of some ghost?
Let me guess, the bad (guy) is gonna be a woman.
Now, THIS is how you continue a franchise(along with "Afterlife")!   Egon's granddaughter carries on!  Notice how the "Ghostbusters" digital film packages don't include the "reboot".   Just 1,2, and "Afterlife"...  They could have made their female cast version workable if they would've had them just open up a franchise of the original operation from the OGs, got their "original" cameos, AND their "new" girl power group. But, nooooooo....  But, now I have "Frozen Empire" to look for...
kids again... damm Hollywood...
I thought this was some fan made trailer...my brain shorted out for a few before I realized this was real.  Such a huge fan of Ghostbusters!
I have a bad feeling about this
Это не охотники за приведениями, а какой-то Роланд Эммерих на минималках, пародия на Послезавтра, смотреть нет никакого желания. Настоящие Охотники - это 1 и 2 части, остально - фуфло
Is that James Acaster??
NOPE! As soon as I saw that Patton Oswalts in this. That's enough for me not to see it.
I am stoked for this one. Loved the first one & glad everyone is back.
Awesome can’t wait
POLTERGEIST OR DEAD?! POLTERGEIST OR DEAD, JAMES ACASTER? POLTERGEIST OR DEAD?!
Where are the jokes?
Take my money now!
👻🚫
Will not be watching unless Patton Oswalt gets cut out, can not stand the man
I saw Bill Murray in it for 1 second, that makes this 100% awesome. Definitely going to watch it!!
Not sure what fear has to do with a literal freezing temperature but okay.... Stay smart out there.
The villain is Elsa, guys. It's obvious.
Got me scared for a second there... I thought it was going to be a sequel for the GB disaster of 2016...
Now all I'm going to hear until this release is "winter is coming"
So glad they steered away from that abomination from 2016, and went down this road with it!
GOSTBUSTERS Frozen  Epire in de best movie hits
Stop woman in action movies,this is the REAL movie,congrats
Just let this franchise die already. Each successive movie gets worse.
Good to see new ideas in a classic franchise movie, not just remaking and depending on what worked in the past. Also  I didn´t expect a sequel, honestly.
I enjoyed Afterlife, but as a nostalgic trip.  This does look like a great concept though.  You've piqued my interest.
GB VS White Walkers!
Ok they learned a lesson , now mixed
Yes! Definitely taking my nieces to see this one.
No please. Let Ghostbusters die already.
At least they are doing something with it. I am willing to bet Jackie Willson won't be lifting it higher, there will be plenty CGI and they will be rushing through character development to spread the attention span of Tik-Tokers.
If you’re gonna keep recycling movies, at least remember what was good about the original in the first place. 🤦‍♀️
finally they will make a donkey kong tropical freeze movie! FINALLY!
Can’t wait!
The new Destiny DLC is looking dope...oh wait
ghostbusters as a franchise is on the edge of being a ghost, barely has a pulse anymore but they will get every ounce of life out of it before they let it go and make something original.
I'm SO looking forward to this😊❤
Looks fun
I love Afterlife but i do love the fact that they are relying less on nostalgia and more on something original 😙
This is the first ghostbusters film I saw with a body count 😮
Slaayyyyy
At least the cast is diverse this time
This is exactly what I hoped for - after a soft reboot that pretty much covered old ground we are now getting new tales and adventures.
I love that from the very first second of the trailer we are subconsciously back in the 80s with Cruel Summer.  You don't need to modernise Ghostbusters and you don't need ti be stuck in the past with constant references, but it should at least feel like the original 80s movies.
I hope the new NY mayor don’t call them frauds like in the other movies after this Armageddon like catastrophe
Boy oh boy, this looks so bad.
A videogame like that would be great
THIS LOOKS AWESOME
well thats surprising and i hope its so good as the last One BUT nothing spiritual in this World comes so strange and Powerful like in Ghostbusters it means its unreal
I’m afraid that this movie is going to meet with a chilly reception.  Quite honestly, the haters need to chill out, and watch this cool trailer.
So many obvious BOT accounts in the comments. This looks terrible
Nice one Brian
Is it’s Ghostbusters 4
Subscribed!
Lame
Hollywood really doesnt want to make anything original. That would be too difficult. Let’s just keep regurgitating classics till fans are tired of it. That’s what disney did with Star Wars.
I hope they would also include the “Extreme Ghostbusters” team ( Garrett Miller, Slimer, Kylie Griffin, Eduardo Rivera, & Roland Jackson).
Keep those dumb women away from Ghost Busters forever! (Previous movie)
OK, so basically I have to watch Afterlife now?
Literally thought this was a sequel to The Day After Tomorrow when I saw this trailer in theaters 😅
OK I'm in!! This looks legit awesome.
Oh god. Please stop! No one cares!
I always said we need to see Ecto-1 barreling down the street doing sick turns like the tumbler in Batman Begins, After Life didn't disappoint and Frozen Empire does not look like it will either.
I hope that they dont spoil it with woke crap
I can’t wait for this. I love all the Ghostbusters movies with the original characters. I liked the lady GB but of course all the male characters were dumb and useless. Yeah keep the woke out of the Ghostbusters. Afterlife was the first movie in years to have that heart in it. Movies today lack so much heart. And it’s great that after all those years we finally got another ghost buster movie with so much heart it was up there with both the originals.
so fun!
Lyssandra... Is that you? XD
This looks epic. And I'm super happy that they still have the original team coming back for another fight!
I am sorry but no. Please Hollywood,, go to the library and  find some new, original and new stories.
I’m in
I really liked afterlife and looked forward to a new movie. I guess I had hoped it wouldn’t simply be “The day after tomorrow” with a supernatural twist
Best reboot in cinematic History just got even better.
Yay! We will get another RLM Ghostbusters reboot review!!
It may be original, but it is a dumb plot line to a ghostbusters film! I think the Hollywood writers should of just stayed on strike, unless this was written by AI then they should use better AI programs lol!
Se vienen con todo los trailers
I definitely want to see this one!
Put a black woman in it and make it gay
Winter is coming...
The last film with the women was god awful I want to forget about it forever. Hope this one will be better.
Woooooo so pumped!
🤡BETTER NOT BE AN "AL GORE / GRETA THUNBERG" CLIMATE CHANGE MOVIE - YOU WILL FAIL
they don't learn lessons about the cast
When I seen the original black dude I said I'm watching this!!!!!!
If the women ghostbusters are no inthis it will be a hit. Good riddance
Looks rubbish, and i dare say, these are the best clips
Looks like it'll be terrible but let's do it nostalgia sake.
"Put a chick in it, make her g*y, and make it Lame."
why are you letterboxing this trailer? got a display with wide aspectratio... and now i have a fat black frame. thats stupid...
Wife killer Patton Oswalt is in this huh. That alone makes me want to pass. Unfunny chubster killed a woman and ruins everything he touches.
The ECTO-1 siren and the Proton Pack spinning up are so iconic .
Yeah, no thanks.
I didn't realize this was legit at first. Thought it was gonna be a fan made trailer for the failed GB3 where NY is sucked into a hell dimension. I'm pleasantly surprised.
Hollywood has seriously run out of ideas
What a load of crap really
Predictive programming, it's what the oligarchs have planned for America
I'm in!
Well this one might not suck like the one with the women did.
These movies really miss out on why the originals were beloved. Despite being about ghosts, the premises were at least somewhat grounded. Now the ghosts are just straight up magic with no real rules.
Absolute garbage
okayyyy lissandra 1:50
Охотники за приведениями:ляденой ужас
Ну если бабы обвалили сборы, то старперы и дети, точно его поднимуть, да-да)
At first I thought someone's uploaded a weather disaster movie.
This is a working title..... right.?
This, with Rise of the Ghost Lord just finally releasing... I feel these two have some similar vibes. But this is heavily throwing back to the classics as well. I'm excited, keep them coming! GB for life! 2016 never happened! 👻 🚫
looks crap
THE POWER OF FROST! THE POWER OF FROST! THE POWER OF FROST!
Yes yes YES!!!  And it’s not Gozer!!!! I am stupid excited!!!
❤ wooooooooooooow 🤩
This all.....makes no sense..... i fear that this is the beginning to absolutely bring the Ghostbusters to death like the newest Indiana Jones or all the other brands that milked at the end...
Nope.. still not the spirit of Ghostbusters. It’s hard to believe a big production these days can deliver such vibe. It’s all plastic and decisions by committee.  They should come up with something new instead of these constant remakes. But we know they won’t of course. Trying to get rich fast and artistic integrity and creativity just don’t go hand in hand.
Heard you missed them....well THEYRE BACK!🥳👻
As long as the movie isn't woke, it should be fine.
Another one? Really?
Wither storms be like
Sunda empire😂😅😂😅
Paul Rudd is such a goofy dude. I'll watch him do anything at this point
And some kids safe the World. No Thanks
Bill about to do his worst acting ever!
Siiii por fin
So excited 😮
Why ?
I have doubts about this one, the director is not back for this one.
Bigger… longer…. And UNCUT!!!!!
Take my money 💰
I'm curious how many people care at this point
To much comedy which balances on the line of stupidity in the new Ghostbusters film now nothing like the 1st film which made it special
Pass
I’m watch a WNBA game instead.
I’m a ghostbusters fan. I like 1,2, the first tv show, the extreme ghostbusters, and I played the ps2 and ps3 ghostbusters game. But I can’t get excited for these movies. After life came too late. It’s not the same with out egon and see the cgi ego just turned me away even more. To me it’s nothing more than the sad reality that we will never have a the ghostbusters all together in a movie. It’s like Leia in rise of skywalker you know she’s not there and you’ll never get to see the 4 of them as a family again
What has Ghostbusters become 😔😔😔
Yesss :D
Let it go... Let it go~
0:55, YES
The Cold Never bothered them anyways ❤️🔔❤️
Just don't go unnecessarily woke with the movie and we will love it
cant wait
We shall see.🤗
nice
I have concerns. giggle, jazz-hands "it's so cool" ripped me right out of the rest of the trailer 1:35 . Why? just, Why?
?
Well having cast Paul Rudd he’ll look the same 20 years from now while cast mates age
That feels like a subversive tone of Climate Change as a theme. If this makes people happy then that's great but I hope more for longevity with the franchise.
Keep butchering the good names of these old films.... NEVER going to watch it...
🔥🔥
*LET'S GO BABY*
Yeap the real gostbuster are back.😊
piggie slllllloooooop
Not feeling it at all for a Ghostbusters movie
Glad to see the great ghostbusters franchise get a new start with movies that aren’t what the fans got in 2016. This new series is far superior.
THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!
They really need to force that right? 😂 omg dude
Sorry to say this but...........meh?
This look amazing. Much better storyline than the recycled Gozer storyline.
Ghostbusters 👻🚫 vs The Death Chill 👻❄️
Sub-zero  Wins   Fatalitie
Looks good...but...frozen bad guy final camera shot followed by casual looking unwinterized, non-glove wearing protagonists?? Did someone forget to inform the actual cast of the "weather"?? 🤦🤣
Elsa is coming 😂
Pfff.. "Frozen legacy" will fit the title better ..😆..let's see
Woke buster!!!!!
I'm so happy we don't have to wait that long to see it
Yay!!
Sweet
I hope that Slimer shows up no since the will be back to NY and since he is a good guy now it could be helpful.
I'm definitely here for it
Hope this is not woke or semi woke
Woke woke woke
New film? Wow...but i hate this new squad ghostbuster(this kids).
I'm not a fan of Patton Oswalt. I hope his part is a small one.
Yes, yes, yes. An original ghost. I am so excited.
Do you want to build a snow man?
a ghostbuster movie trailer with no ghosts LOL
Patton makes it a big no....   Now anyone can be a Ghostbuster, Mom, Kids, meh.   Changes to the power packs and tech by who?  Ecto-1 now must always be a supped up drift machine.  Relying heavy on memberberries still, but obviously not made for those who do remember and are fans of the original ip.
Should we be alarmed that it doesn't mention Bill Murray in the cast description?  I'm all for surprises (like not including Rock Moranis and then seeing him turn up) But this film needs some Bill / Ernie / Dan loving.  Afterlife teased it and introduced new characters which is awesome! but lets give them all screentime now.
It's the Lich King.
Please 🙏🏽 don’t make it woke !
looks solid frozen solid 😏  but puns aside im excited afterlife was stellar and this looks to keep that momentum going
pls stop
Just leave it alone nothing comes close to the originals.
Remember that time Ghostbusters was a satire about capitalism and the jerks who exploit it. Yeah, me either.
I was worried at first but then I saw the original cast, minus one and figured this is going to be awesome!!!!
first
This looks awful.
I didn't see this movie coming but really excited for it!!!
Holy hell it looks amazing
meh
😊😊😊😊😊that just gave me chills 😊 but it looks very good 😊 I can't wait to see it at the movies 😊
Definitely not a fan of all these new GB movies
New York has to be THE most constantly destroyed city on Earth. No wonder they’re so grumpy.
Who you gonna call? 👻🚫
*FINALLY!!!* Something *different, original and UNexpected!* So hyped! Can't wait! 🚫👻
If you get the villain right, the rest falls in to place.
Looks great, Bravo!
Yeeeeeeeessssss
Love the Jaws homage.
Va a ser muy mala
No No No And no!  You will not make replace my memories with wtv this is.
why would anyone make a sequel to a very bad first one?
I'm sorry, but how is this not called Ghostbusters: Chiller or Ghostbusters: Cold Spot?   Seriously missed opportunity for a thematically appropriate name.
feels very ghostbusters 2 and I am all for it
Yes. A new ghostbusters 😊😊
All I have to say is..... Holy-@$$^, $@%^ING, SUPER-S%&$ awsome 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯!!!!!!
Super glad it’s not just ‘Somehow Gozer returned’. Every ghostbusters movie since the original has had the problem of retracing the first movie’s plot almost scene-for-scene, so I’m hyped to see this franchise progress beyond reboot purgatory.
Low-effort hack-job with nothing but nostalgia-bait and 'jokes' created in the editing room to prop it up.
Patton Oswalt's character will turn out to be the main villain maybe?
Hollywood dumpster 🔥
Ready to buy a ticket.  Hoping that this is up to the standard of Afterlife, and thinking that it will be.  And nice to see that Ecto-1 apparently has a speaking role, because that powerslide certainly says a lot.
LICH KING IS BACK!
So just a sad PC remake that copies Stranger Things…ok then. Sad that they have ruined this franchise with this garbage and the girl version.
kumail will ruin the entire movie somehow; just like every other crappy movie he’s in
Yoo new GB!!! I loved afterlife and I'm so excited to see that y'all still continuing GB!
Yoo new GB!!! I loved afterlife and I'm so excited to see that y'all still continuing GB!
looked interesting then i saw that pos oswalt is in it. hard pass.
looks interesting. I like the mix in of the OG surviving crew. Like Paul Rudd. The roided out guy from the immortals. Should be pretty good!
This looks original, fun, inspired and new. Are they allowed to make a movie like that in Hollywood? Doesn't it go against the law or something?
I thought the last one did bad gzz. Btw I still haven't watched just what I've read
looking good
Why did they cast kids in this ughhhhh it ruined the franchise
Still love the Lady Ghostbusters the best to date...
Hell yeah! I didn´t know that they are working on it. I love Ghostbusters since I was 10 and as original cast is in, at least for a cameo, it´s mega cool. I´m soooooo excited
I wish this was coming out around next Halloween, but i would be SO DOWN for this to have a Christmas release
유령 또 잡자!!! 예!!!!🙆
Woof...I was excited to watch the trailer but the CGI is The Flash levels bad.
this looks really really dumb.
Scarriest part was seeing people swim in Coney Island water. 😂
cant wait for this to come out.
I guess they didn't lose enough money on the last load of crap..they have to have another go.
Definitely gonna be woke lol
Do you wanna build a snowman? 🤪
It’s a…cool, cool summer?
Can someone help me out, when they show the ghostbuster hideout what are those three musical notes they play? Asking because I want to use it as a text tone
I had no idea this sequel was even in the works! I loved Afterlife and this looks so fun!
So everyone in the gang is going up against a Fear-Frost Lich Ghost?   Definitely sounds interest!
...can't wait for this to bomb.
So theyre super heroes now?
Wait, that's Elsa from Frozen 2 ending, where she left her country towards the ocean to a new land, so now she end up here in New York, Wrong Universe Elsa. That's why she's angry cause she's afraid again.......LOL That's why its called Frozen Empire....... A Live Horror action of Frozen......
I suggesting changing the title.
WE'RE SO BACK
Welp, another movie flop for the count. Honestly, the only actually good major film release this year was GotG 3.
Elsa from Frozen is the new enemy
They should include Louis Tully in this, the original reserve member of the team
I love Paul Rudd, except in Romeo & Juliet. He was fine but he wasn't a real astronaut. He was a phoney.   McKenna Grace is an amazing goddess. She's a great actress, singer, human. She's gorgeous and talented. She's been great in everything.  This is the first movie I've been interested since.... the last one GB?  In a while anyway.
😱😱😱😱😱😱🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 oh my god!!!
This casting looks whack.
Hmmm....how can we make this movie less enjoyable? Put Kumail Nanjiani AND Patton Oswalt in it, of course.
Finally hitting to the core of the ghostbuster experience, there is a ghost , one should stop
Good kool can't wait,,another good real film only from the ghost busters crew ,no leftist woke ,trans ,in the real world ,.
Someone get into the Ice-9?
It's should be call Ghostbusters 4 Ice Ghost.🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻
where is Podcast????
Nooooooooo 🤮🤮 please !
Interesting.
I love the RGB vibes!!! I’m really excited for this one!!
Geostorm 2
This looks like absolute trash.
It would be amazing if Dean and Sam made a cameo.
Patton Oswalt is the worst part of this trailer. I really hope he is not in it much.
I cant wait for this movie!
2024 is ghostbusters year!!! Not only with this movie but the 40th anniversary of the franchise!!!
why is that creep patton oswald in this
Omg I been waiting too much for this I am excited I love ghostbusters 😢😂❤
Great trailer except for one glaring omission?? The CLASSIC THEME!!!
Paul Rudd is so hottt
Nope
This has the feel of a season 1 JMS episode of TRGB. That is meant as a compliment.
For the love of Bananarama ❤
The movie looks great the way they're handling the ghost is pretty scary and terrifying looking forward to seeing it 😊❤
Wow looks terrible
Winter is coming! 👻❄
So damn excited. The reboot has made what was already such a good franchise even better.
Looks really interesting
Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire feels like The Real Ghostbusters!
Step aside ladies the Men have returned! 😎
NEW IP PLEASE..... Enough of this beating of the dead horse....
Wow this is cool 🥶       Get it cool          Like cold ice like in the movie         You know what forget it
the new ghostbusters movies proves that sequels to beloved franchises can be good. star wars has to take notes
I think that ghost is Hel. Possibility but it could be a made up ghost or god
You got me back with Afterlife,  this one looks very well shot and made with love and respect for the originals, unlike the mean spirited, infantile derivative pap from 2016.  My only criticism is the inclusion of Patton Oswald - he's a tool.
Featuring a cameo by a real ghost!👻 Patton's victim and former wife 🫡
I don’t know about this I wish they would stay with the original movies and not make so many sequels
This is gonna be worth the wait!❤
I REALLY hope it's a new villain
A fourth and a new generation.👍
I'm so gonna see this God I love the fact I grew up in the 90s. This seems more like the original gb movies
For the love of all that's good someone please  make a parody trailer with Frozen.
People in the comments are saying this is Original 😂😂😂… Literally game of thrones the night king😭 How many of these people in the comments are Bots?? You can clearly pick them out..
Ghostbusters: The Day After Tomorrow That New York's winter chill in the middle of summer! And I'm here for it!! 🥶🥳
YES!! keep ‘‘em coming guys🏆🏆 love to see the originals and afterlife together again
@Ghostbusters Why is Bill Murrays name not mentioned in the cast (video description)?, anyway love ❤ the teaser trailer!
this looks like fun
The night king in Ghostbusters!!! 😮😮😮
So everybody just up and moved again?
I can't wait for Ghostbusters Afterlife frozen
This looks awesome!  Can't wait!  These movies are proof that g!rls weren't the problem.
Looks promising. I'll hold my judgement until I see the full product. It's cool to see a new threat/crisis in the series, but doing something TOO different can make the film feel like it's not even a Ghostbusters movie. Just putting some proton packs and familiar faces in the film isn't enough, we've seen this with the 2016 reboot. Just gonna have to hope for the best, but it does look promising.
Awesome!
Ghostbusters return
😁😁yaay
I liked the comeback movie, and I just hope that this sequel can be good reputation of making entertainment, entertaining and not political
Is this a fake trailer?
I want to watch this but you have four of the most annoying people in it ( I'm not putting Paul Rudd in that list) Patton , Kumail, Finn, And James Acaster can't act and aren't  funny, And I still can't see why a Mother would let her kids be in that much danger. ( I just realized they are gonna come to the rescue of the O.G.s to even the score aren't they. 🤦‍♂️🤬🤬)
I am SO FRICKIN HAPPY RIGHT NOW❤❤❤❤❤
Ghostbusters frozen empire in theaters april 19 2024 imax
Oh Rick Moranis where are you😮
It’s official! These are not the sequels to the movies, they are the sequels to the ABC Straczynski cartoon episodes.
Nobody asked for this
I dont know!
I would have loved to see them encounter the boogie man as they did in the cartoon, still this one will be a watch.
Silly
When I watched Jurassic Park Dominion you had the Jurassic Park cast, the Jurassic World cast and new  characters. Particularly in action scenes, when they were all together they were tripping all over each other and at several points literally queuing to get to safety.   I’m all up for “Ghost Busters on Ice” and member berries, but please avoid having huge groups of ghost busters on screen at once. Be better to have 2 teams needed to solve 2 problems simultaneously rather than 2 teams of people in a queue waiting around to do their bit.
Where is the theme?
stop marvel "humor"
I love that they are continuing with brand new stories.
Kids are back. Oldsters have cameos. We're back in NYC. No "woke" messaging. Looks like it should be pretty good!
Who do you call? “GHOSTBUSTERS!!!”  Watching this follow-up it’s like having a 40th anniversary for over 40 years which will be a celebration of the classic Ghostbusters film! I hope you grab your ghost vacuums in this frozen spooky NY area!
So it’s basically Ghostbusters combined with the day after tomorrow. Got it!
Looks like a pile of garbage. Nothing will ever beat the originals.
So It's basically 1 bloke with 3 kiddies?! 😂
yawn
An uncontrollable Ice Storm
I’m so hyped, loving the new ideas  for a new ice themed villain, loving how the mixing the new team with the old team, this is honestly the way Ackroyd wanted the franchise to go and I’m so thankful for it, after the original being my absolute favorite movie of all time for 29 years, I’m glad to see the story continue
Paul Rudds characters are always hilarious
Looks like more dross nostalgia bait, with none of the grounded humour/sarcasm/tone of the original. The original was great because it was several huge, dry-witted comedians at their peak. This....isn't.
This looks awesome. Afterlife was just wonderful and I can't wait for this one.
This doesn’t feel like Ghostbusters. I’m just saying. The Ghostbusters 1 and 2 trailers are better than this trailer. Show us more ghosts so we could have more faith in this movie.
Love the look of this and loved the last one.
This looks like it might be good.  Hopefully it's better than "Afterlife."  And hopefully I don't have the experience ruined by noisy, rude people like I did with that film lol
I was hoping for a Christmas 2023 release, but I suppose I can wait until the Spring. Barely. SO looking forward to this! "Heat em up!"
I always get so excited with nostalgia when I see Ecto-1 and hear that siren. The original 2 films as well as The Real Ghostbusters cartoon were a huge part of my childhood, and Afterlife gave me joy to see the guys together again, and now this one looks really promising as well. Can't wait to see it!!
This looks good!
Cool 👻👻👻👻✌️😜❤️❤️❤️
Music was way too loud but other than that trailer is ok.
Life King gets everywhere.
Why? Who is this movie for?🤡
I'm totally hyped!!!🤩🚫👻
Who ya gonna call?  THE MOVIE THEATER FOR TICKETS!!
GHOSTBUSTERS: Ghost of Elsa.
Patton Oswald needs to be cut out of the movie.  NO ONE LIKES HIM!!
Thank God they are back
Prego mescuzi El freezo
It looks great. I'm cautious with any new movie, but the last one was great, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt
Yes! Yes!
I'm cold
Ghostbusters the revenge of else
If it's Ghostbusters, I'll watch it. That being said, this looks like a lot of fun!
nope, gonna be woke and full of the woke actors and trying to bring in the chick busters that flopped.....
Paul Rudd and Patton Oswalt are perfect for the franchise. Patton makes a great replacement for Louis Tully. Movie looks great! It would have been cool to release it towards the end of December, as so many families go to the theater during Christmas break.
this looks as stupid as the previous one with the kids THAT NOBODY ASKED FOR....just please stop making these...for the love of science STOP
Yep. I'm definitely buying tickets to this.
thislooks better then the 2021 movie and i loved that one
Looks so much more interesting than Afterlife. Ghostbusters is a franchise that has never met its true potential. Make it scarier, do something different. I truly hope this is it!
Loving the original feel in New York, with the Spanglers giving it the new look. Now I believe if they keep it old school look with a modern twist they can keep the franchise alive forever beyond the original cast. Like inhering the keys to the kingdom.
Why do we keep ruining this franchise
Hope they didn’t take a page out of the Kathleen Kennedy “How to Destroy Star Wars Handbook” and kill off the OG Ghostbusters.
Everyone gets proton packs now?? What's going on?
Can't be anymore worse than ghostbusters 2016
This movie looks great, but can we please stop casting Patton Oswalt as the “lovable, geeky, Everyman”? He’s just awful.
HYPE
i loved afterlife and im sure im gonna love this one
Ugh!!  The sound of the posts lighting up just gives me the chills (no pun intended)
Gawd please not another kids movie...
Oh. That's it?  For the first time in four films I'm not excited about a Ghostbusters release, which considering how badly let down I felt by the last one after seeing it, is understandable.
No way how do they have a new movie already I bet they cookin 🧑‍🍳
yeeeeeeeees please !!!! its going to be a blast !"!!!! 🙂
why no OG ghostbuster music in the trailer?
😊😮🎉❤ 💝mencato el Trailer
This looks Amazing. As someone who grew up with the first two movies, i guarantee this will be Good.
@1:17 dafuq is up with Dan's face?
im hype for this
I am so going to see it next year!!!!!!
Why, God, Why? Make it stop!
Damn right.  Afterlife was great, and this seems like a real, honest continuation rather than another "rhyme" of earlier work.  I'm onboard already.
meh
This looks so good!
This may actually be the first time we get a Ghostbusters Trilogy.  Think about it. There was no Ghostbusters III in the original series, Afterlife is a sequel of the original movie (while erase Ghostbusters II from there timeline), and we don't talk about 2016 Movie.  Guess they would never stop busting ghosts.
A “Chilling” Way to celebrate the 40th anniversary
I would rather watch this than The Marvels
Don't make it too childish and cringe..plss
can we get a Ghostbusters Streaming Show on Netflix?
needs more black people ! not enough Diversity ?
🤮 I am so sick of franchises. Can we get original movies please?
Is that Bill Hader's voice at 1:08?
not since Ghostbuster 2 has there been a film this great , i haven't even seen it yet and already the greatest film EVER  ,  OSCARS
Mmmmmmmm... This looks like a good sequel.  & an interesting new villainous entity.
Uh. So... everything I hated about Afterlife will... ...be returning?  ...yay.
Is the Elsa at the end?
Ghostbusters busting the Night King!🥶
Ahhh the global warming message makes its appearance.  But I truly hope that Bill Murray has a significant role in this movie. He makes any of these movies that much better.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!  I`M SO HYPED I LOVE GHOSTBUSTERS!
any one want an ice cream during watching this movie ?
No Rick Moranis? This movie will suck, man! Sucks!
Because the first one was such a massive success.....
Frozen 3 is not what I expected.
looks cringe
Didn’t they say the firehouse was now a Starbucks in the first movie?
1:52 Umh Lissandra ?
I don't like the children's cast (especially the boys), but the film will be good!
Meh. Beta boys Paul Rudd and Patton Oswalt play second fiddle to teen boss girl granddaughter whose name isn’t worth remembering. Good to see Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd, as always.  But member berries don’t make a good movie.  I’ll pass.
Patton Oswald is a disgusting person.
The best way to ruin anything is to add Patton oswolt.
youhouuuuuuu!!!!
this looks dumb...
Made a mistake to move this from December.
“SOMEONE GET ME THE GHOSTBUSTERS “
I don't know guys, I think this movie is going to get a cold reception.
🤔
I didn't even know they were making this.
Oh em gosh I CANT WAIT
This is amazing I'm glad they're making a new movie
Ghostbusters 2016 got the essence of franchise better, this is literally a serious movie. Ghostbusters was never meant to be a serious movie.
This is what happens when Elsa doesn't let it go....🥶
So this is scott doing after beating kang the conqueror teaming up with the eternals to beat up some ghosts
Why are we still beating the dead horse that is Ghostbusters? Just let it go, it just doesn't work as a franchise.
Hopefully its Dis Pater ripping himself out of hell somehow, or the creature once thought of as Dis.  Better be some 9th circle stuff and not some generic Thor Ice dimension monster.
Love this!! Grew up with these guys👻
Ghostbusters：The Day After Tomorrow 👻🥶
Sigourney Weaver？
Patton Oswalt is a huge hypocrite for being in this. Back in 2016 he trashed the original franchise and James Rolfe's support for it in favor of the 2016 reboot.  So now it's pretty convenient that he's set aside his "principles" for a paycheck.
Remember when the studios used to make new original stories for the new films?
What? No stupid jokes and gender/race-driven cast estimated only by their talent? This can't be true
How did I not know about this until now?
I want Rick Moranis to bust through the door at the end wearing a proton pack , and i want him to say sorry im late , then he  starts blasting the deathchill and saves the day .
As long as woke Hollywood doesn't bring back the all-women cast, Ghostbusters franchise may have a half-decent movie. Truth be told, I haven't watched any of the movies since Ghostbuster II...
This is giving 'Real Ghostbusters' cartoon energy and I am SO here for it!!! Can't wait! 💚💚💚
Make it gay and lame!
Hudson, Akroyd, and Murray sure have aged. Whether they aged well is their tale to be told, not mine.
Mannnn I wish they did this before Egon died 😢
А где же сам Сабзиро?🤔
I like the transition they did in Ghostbusters Afterlife passing the baton to the new generation. Seeing old guys continue coaching the new generation and giving them the exposition and a fresh new adventure is great! Can't wait to watch this at the theater.
Keep it non woke like the last one= epic
not funny, boring too
How am I so excited for this movie!? Oh I know why, cuz it actually looks GOOD!
1:03 makes this movie the best movie of 2024
seriously? damnnnn when will they stop exploding those good 80's films with this type of bullshit?
More old IPs. Do. Something. Original.
As long as they don't 2016 it.
Hed did the Giant Man laugh 10/10
So, if this movie is bad, the Ghostbusters franchise will have more bad entries than good ones. Couldn’t leave well enough enough alone. This looks lame in my opinion
So it’s the day after tomorrow?
I was here for the ghost busters soundtrack.. where is it??
they're turning Ghostbusters into Stangerthings
Wouldn't be great an open-world Ghostbusters vídeo game?
ハリウッドもネタ切れですか！🤭
Olaf ?
This gave me chills 🥶..
Jason Reitman did it again, I can’t wait. 👻 🚫
If you liked the original two movies you will love Afterlife, forget about the all-female crap it did not happen so there are only 3 Ghostbuster films so far and if this is as good as the Trailer make it look then there will be a fourth.
Should have left it with the originals. First with all female cast and now this shows why Hollywood have no fresh ideas left for films.
Wow this looks absolutely fantastic!!! Can't wait to see this!
Got to bring back Egon to help with this one also 👍🏾 it was his idea to start the ghostbusters 👍🏾
This story looks wicked!! 😮
It was mentioned that the proton packs caused burns in the game, so I get this feeling we'll see proton packs turned on people to thaw them. This should be interesting.
There's no denying that this is going be awesome
The day after tomorrow looks different here.
well, wow. im sold
Cool, another movie made for little kids. I bet grades 1-5 are going to love it
Trash
Patton Oswalt, HARD PASS.
This is real?
YUHHH
Finn Wolfhard is in this. It's like Stranger Things meets Ghostbusters. Somehow, this seems like a natural evolution.
This looks horrendous apart from the Bill Murray cameo
Wow Ghostbusters fighting climate change
I will cry if Rick Moranis does a cameo
Ghostbusters: Tropical Freeze
I just want more Phoebe!!!
Nja 1980 back trilogy interesing moment soon other adventure Ghostuter 😂😎👍💯💯💯💯💯
This has more of an intense, scary vibe, like the animated series. Cool.
I wonder if Elsa from Frozen had anything to do with this? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sounds like the dumbest premise for a movie I've heard this year. "Whooah what if we made a ghost movie but it was about ice!" Are you guys letting 10yo kids write your scripts?
I miss when the only child in Ghostbusters was a baby with no voice lines. Really hate the modern concept that a movie has to have young actors to pull in a younger audience. I watched the original as a child and had no gripes about the age range of the cast. This treatment reminds me of pacific rim  compared to its sequel the pre-teen power rangers. When I first started watching this trailer I thought of the fake scorcher franchise in the movie tropic thunder 😅 "who left the fridge open?"
Love the trailer, looks great. Excited for this movie. Seen good and ok movies recently but this gives me a feel for how movies use to be great and excellent.
Ghostbusters represent! A fine example of keeping your franchise alive with characters, old and new, and original ideas!
Waited years for a third Ghostbusters movie, and Afterlife was awesome and packed full of nostalgia. Can't wait for Frozen Empire!
This looks like the sort of story you’d get from the cartoon!  😊
Looks absolutely amazing. Then, Patton Oswalt. I'll pass, thanks.
Spikes coming from the sea and nobody dying is wild to me
Hopefully that movie doesn't bring back Gozer or Vigo again, I want something new🙏
USA is really running out inguinity ...re-hatching 30+ years old movies...😢
hoping that patton oswalds screen time is minimal
The last movie afterlife was horrible . Let’s hope this one is better
I cant wait
Paul Rudd's reaction to having a Proton Pack on is how all of us would react in our 30s and 40s... I have not been to a movie theater in more than a decade... That will change.
Looks good to me! Nice to hear Bananarama again as well. 👍
So Elsa is working with the White Walkers! 🥶🥶🥶
They literally made a live action episode of 'The Real Ghostbusters'. I'm hear for it.
The title makes it sound like they'll be fighting Elsa.
paul rudd = national treasure
Patton Oswalt is in it equals pass.
Cool
the problem with this concept is other than paul rudd's character you got the original ghostbusters suited less with the uniform and more the garment of a retirement community, and the younger cast belonging more in junior high at best than on the frontlines while being permitted even with adult supervision, dealing with supernatural horrors. Even though its suppose to be a family friendly sci-fi comedy, this makes the scenario seem unauthentic, contrived and silly at the cost of any suspension of disbelief.
C’mon Sony, Patton Oswalt?  Really??  Bad casting choice.
Who ya going to call? ☎️
Cool trailer. Wish there were new more exciting weapons.
Im so ready for this!  👻👻👻
Looks interesting. Not funny, but interesting.
Yes yes yes yes!
Great Trailer, but don´t like the titel.  And i think there should be more Ghost instead of only ice effects.
Is it me or does the car skid around in perfect summer but YET the whole city is frozen ;)
I guess the title Firehouse was a ruse then? I still say they should do a movie from an episode of the real Ghostbusters. I'll gladly take Boogyman or Samhain.
1:53 giant ant man civil war reference ❤️
CGI Looks amazing, and it’s awesome that the original cast is back, but you lost me with the Ghostbuster kids and the forced diversity.
Ghostbusters should’ve begun and ended with the original masterpiece.
New York City don’t stand a chance in disaster movies 😂😢
*DEFINITELY watching this!*
Omfg cant wait. Afterlife hung in with the original as just a fun enjoyable movie. I hope this can too
the title should be Ghostbuster : Lisandra go to new york
This movie will be mind blowing
This is awesome!!!
Ah. And with that, 2016 is officially erased! 🙌
1:30, was that Dana Barrett? It was so quick I couldn’t tell if it was here at Callie with frozen hair.
Looks a bit too dark.
Wasn't aware another was being made but seeing the original cast (most of anyway) I'm happy plus its back in New York which is a great setting!
Arthas?! Is that you???
This is crazy I can't believe the Ghostbusters are going to fight Elsa from Frozen
Bring me the main bgm!!
Hell yeah so excited glad to see the Og crew still around this look so cool
Watched this again. Guessing the containment unit is gonna split open due to whats happening. See what comes out.
My boy Prismo!
oh my spine chilling >.< ugh!!
anything to see Bill Murry and Dan Aykroyd, even if its brief co-star roles, together again.
Am I the only one who thought Afterlife had some weak writing, especially at the end?  I genuinely loved the characters, and the actors who played them, but they could have done a better job with the story.
Make it stop!!!!
I just wanna see Ecto 1 again
I wish they made the extreme ghostbusters instead.
Boooooooring
Can't wait to never see this
Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze vibes 🥶
I love it
Looks Fantastic, cannot wait to see it 😊
you know it will fail. going woke going home
It had my attention....until I saw Patton Oswalt, and now I know this film is going to disappoint. Also, it looks like Ghostbusters vs Global Warming. Definitely not seeing this one 👎🏻👎🏻
This looks insanely cool! Can't wait!
If Mr Freeze ever gets brought back to live action Batman films, this is how it should be done along with the characterisation of Freeze from the 90s animated series.
Yes!!! Another movie to be excited about 🤭😌😁😏😉🤗
Take my money
This looks fun.
Mr. Freeze escaped Batman.  Only to clash with the Ghostbusters.
Pro: the kids.   Great. Con: Patton Oswalt.  Diamond hard pass.
i survive the frozen empire soon.
it's been a while. welcome back ghostbusters.
Please stop!!! Create something new for once...
Please just make a few and call it good. Don’t want seventeen tv shows to bastardize forever.
Well done SONY....this looks great!
😂😂😂😂😂
Ghostbusters is the best movie ever made
Love me some ghostbusters.
NICE!!! Have to watch Afterlife yet but it seems credit to the good times is done properly
Hopefully there will be minimal woke nonsense.
A ruined franchise🚫
Patton Oswalt? NO, NO, NO! His old tweets about young children are sickening.
Elsa comes to NY
A freeze? So the villain is going to be an ice ghost???
Holy moly nice job sending bots to praise your movie in the commentary section.
YASSSSSSSS!!!
Patton Oswald? NO, NO, NO! His old tweets about young children are sickening.
So, building up for a very unnerving, unsettling, scary atmosphere, leading up to the climax: "Like literally scared to death" . And then Patton Oswald giggling "That is so cool", no it's not, you just ruined the climax. Textbook definition of 'bathos'.  I loved the trailer, right up to that point. Please Sony, if you can still do something about it, don't treat this movie like a joke.
I'm already in the queue at my local cinema.
Looks like so many innocent people die in this movie.
Are we dealing with a frost ghost!?
Has the whole world gone crazy !!!
_Two for Ghostbusters Frozen Empire , please_
epic!!
I just got chills!!
it seems literally inspired by Stranger Things! Let's hope at least is fun to watch, cause movies lately disappoint
Even though this is a PG movie -it’s way better than any super hero MCU or DC film in years.
Paul Rudd uuhh...yeahhh❤
Holy crap, I had no idea this was in the works!  SO FREAKIN' EXCITED!!!!
I really hope we get to see Arnold Schwarzenegger saying, "Everyone cool out" to a crowd of people running away before turning into an icicle. If not it would be a hugely missed opportunity.
"The day after tomorrow" vibes :D
As long as its not an All female cast. Im in
This looks WOKE asf and the 'fans' of the this strike me as the Star Wars type, tasteless. I didnt like how they used the original Ghostbusters in Afterlife, andthis doesnt look much better,just a bunch of inclusive rubbish with this effeminate man, Paul Rudd
Why does everything need to be a franchise?
Hey team, take a knee. I have good news and bad news. The good news is that it wasn't actually ghosts. The bad news is that it is climate change. Now, if you'll all turn to page two of the hand out, I've included a graph illustrating the carbon footprint of our ecto-containment unit ...
What?? another re-imagine diversity cast for woke championship again?
This is the only franchise capable of bringing a tear to my eye
Amazing. Such a great intro. The sunset shot over the empire state building with bananarama playing over it giving 80/90s vibes and nods to the past sets the tone perfectly. Great work. This is then shattered by the looming freeze. Well done. Cannot wait. 🎉🎉🎉
This is the type of thing they should have done with Star Wars. You can have the old and the new.
Well there’s something you don’t see everyday
Just let it die already holy crap
My way to survive is Psalm 23:4:Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.
Плохое у меня предчувствие
White Walkers? Winter is coming???
This is how requels should be done.... this looks awesome, can't wait for spring guessing it'll be a may release.....
Those red coats are gonna sell in retail stores, just you wait and see. But I'm ready for this, let's go!!!
Oh my God, yes! After Afterlife and with the original cast included once again (even Bill Murray!), I am honestly really excited for this!
...looks terrible!
I think it was video game idea, like I saw concept art for this long time ago.
Finally!!! the rock has come back- to the ghostbusters franchise
WOW.
This just made my heart so happy! Esp Ecto 1 doing a burnout ♥
Oh yes 👏🏻
sony....meh...did they finally learn how to make movies without the inclusive agenda?
This looks great!👍
I really did like afterlife and so I am really looking forward to this movie.
Hey Sony... Give us Rick Moranis and we'll return Patton Oswalt and Kumail Nanjiani to you.
Paul Rudd at the end is literally everyone wearing the proton pack for the first time!
My hype cannot be contained
Ratherwatch mythbusters
That looks cool!
Trailer copies the idea of New York going into a deep freeze from The Day After Tomorrow. Can’t wait to see the Ghostbusters fight a new villain causing it.
These are just episodes of the real Ghostbusters they should just make a Netflix series already
Getting flu in the middle of July is now normal thanks to Covid
Ghostbusters (1984) was a screwball comedy movie about four loveable schmucks, busting ghosts in New York City... It’s intentionally ridiculous, yet the new angle for these legacy sequels is reverence? They don’t know what they’re doing, and I didn’t hear a single joke in this teaser despite the presence of Paul Rudd, Patton Oswald and Kumail Nunjiani… It’s so baffling.
Paul Rudd is all of us
At least it isn't gozer
Yes.  In fact, _all_ the yes.  The entire yes in the world, plus the National Strategic Yes Reserves.  And that may still not be enough yes to adequately answer this.
These four people in the end, I hope the movie doesn't insist on shoving them down our throats as the new team. A woman with two kids and their teacher won't work, it's just wrong.
It's official, creativity is dead in Hollywood.
The last movie stunk! 🦨👃👀
How the hell he’s aloud to work with kids I have no idea 🤮😒😒😒
Owh yeah, bring back the old band and Ecto 1 😍
RedLetterMedia is gonna have a field day with this.
Day After Tomorrow 2 😂
Danny Laruso at the start would of been a cool cameo with the music
Lissandra?
I love that a new GB-Movie is coming...but am I the only one who thinks that the special effects are REALLY not good?
Yesssssssss
I am literally stunned by how terrible this looks.
It's like watching a bunch of fans go on a Universal Studios VR ride or something. This just doesn't even seem for real
Yes. Looks like the perfect balance for another modern sequel. Dan Aykroyd is the man, I love the happy, but atmospheric vibe of his films and I'm over the moon he gets to inject some of that in another Ghostbusters sequel 🤘
So cool!
Once again, that little girl couldn’t carry a proton pack, much less fire one.
Lost me at Patton Oswalt
You had me at the beach scene----then lost me for the rest.
Crossover the woman version with original and reboot
Afterlife was really cute, but this straight up looks AWESOME. Very hyped!!!
If only Harold Ramus was still alive this movie is something I think he would be proud of.  Ramis was one the original was  on the original people that came up with the ghostbusters story in the first place.  So awesome to see the original cast even after all these years so cool to see the suit up once more to fight ghosts  coming against New York
Heck yeah!!
Props to the filmmakers for giving us something we havent seen in 10+ years: An Original villain. I was concerned they were going to reuse Vigo again, but with the original survivng team having more sceentime with the kids, this is exactly the direction the franchise should go in.
hell yeah!!!!!
Looks like AI is used to write overwhelmingly positive comments now.   "Don't forget to include, how much you loved Afterlife"   "Don't react to the characters, not being scared by anything"
Looks cool. I thought Afterlife, while paying a nice homage to the originals, wasn't the best Ghostbusters movie. It was a bit too slow for my liking. But it was better than 2016's outing which wouldn't be too hard.
Awesome!
So now all those people are dead huh? Wouldn't that just make more ghosts?
Awesome , I'm all in ..... LETS GO
I have to be honest. I did not expect another ghostbusters movie to be made. 😐
Looks better than Ghostbusters afterlife. I definitely want to see this movie. The trailer looks really good 👻👻
For those wondering: the movie releases March 29th, 2024, which is Beyond The Spider-Verse's original release date. I don't know why the release date wasn't in the trailer.
its great to see something original that respects the past in kind
Dang! Elsa is back!
At least they dropped the all female cast idea..
Oh yes. Oh yes please!
I think it's a shame that the music isn't present in Afterlife, like in the first two movies. Both movies had such great music.  The new trailer suggests that there is a lack of music again. It seems too serious for that.
Ernie Hudson hasn't aged like the other two and is several years older.
It's well known that many undead wield cold-based magic.
Looks cool (no pun intended). I could do without Patton Oswalt though.
I'm getting some Harry Potter 1 through 4 vibes from this, and it's not a bad feeling.
Get rid of Patton Oswalt. Killed the entire hype.
If this gets 2000 likes I will get a Ghostbusters tattoo of the green dude Slimer from Ghostbusters 😂😂
Oh man god this Sucks it looks like  the Day after Tomorow but with more CGI crap
Ghostbusters: The day after tomorrow
The world needs more Ghostbusters
I’m so happy that we have another ghostbusters movie!
Afterlife was great. You realize kids are the future and times are changing
I hope someone would give frozen reference here
Ghostbusters: The Day After(life) Tomorrow  I’m in
And at the end you would hear "I am Sub-Zero". 😁
Looked good until I saw the cast...
(sigh) Not a new idea in the whole dang house.
Let's thank Sony for making up for the flop girl version of ghostbuster with actually continuing the story as a sequel
Yes! <3 Oh my god this looks like it should :)
Hell yeah!! Hell totally froze over because I wasn't expecting this!! I'm so glad they got Paul Rudd to keep doing these too. HELL YEAH!.
Looks terrible if I'm being totally honest. Just stop.
It sucks that Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are supposed to be killed off in this one.
Uh, I get continuing Atferlife, but did you really need to double the cast?  This just feels way too busy and crowded.
No to the Penguin: Oswalt Cobblepatton
Smells like climate change garbage
RIP Harold Ramis! We miss you!
4.6K Downvotes? Really? Well...go watch that awful 2016 film instead then.
I'm beside myself with another production from my favorite franchise as a child. My nephews and nieces loved the last movie. So we watched the first two and they love those as well. Keep them coming!
Was that Patton Oswalt? Oh HELL NO!
*Glad to see the cameos of the original cast*
Bill Murray's in it? Okay, take my money.
This looks TERRIBLE lol
This isn't ghostbusters.
This looks terrible 😢
As long as it isn`t a WOKE movie remake, it will probably still suck. Given the movies produced this year have been garbage, i highly suspect this will be highly dependant on CGI.
The only thing that matters is RLMs opinions on this.  Save me boys!
Cruel summer and Ghostbusters, it's a hit already!!!!
That last scene is what's wrong with all movies today. When the good guys just laugh and enjoy themselves over villains or action sequences it makes us not empathize or worry or hope for the protagonist. If they are not vulnerable then their adventure is  meaningless and there is no reason the audience should care
1:50 is this Lissandra? lol
Patton Oswalt is still alive? heh... no thanks
I dont know why I thought this was a Frozen Ghostbusters cross over
Doesn't feel like Ghostbusters.
If DC and WB aren’t willing to try again, I’m glad Ghostbusters can give us a Mr. Freeze like threat.
I love ghostbusters is back ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ok seeing Patton Oswald get to be in a Ghostbusters movie is insane. I’m so happy for him, I promise you this is one of his hugest fantasies completely coming to life.
So we're basically getting a live-action version of when the extreme Ghostbusters and original Ghostbusters fought stymie, the Ghost of the Bermuda Triangle, it was a miles long ghost! 🤗😉😎👍
Awesome teaser trailer and with new suits
This time, that wasn't me.
Looks hilarious
Wasn’t expecting them to continue to story after Afterlife. But this is neat to see.
Honestly this was the wrong way to do a sequel. We barley got a decent reboot now their sequel is a stupid “end of the world thing.” Like you know they would have to up the steaks again for the next movie or risk looking lazy as all hell.   What a waste of time and money when they could’ve just made a movie about arresting ghosts.
They are never going to let this poor franchise rest, are they?
afterlife and this are absolute boring crap
These second wave Ghostbusters films are so tonally different they don’t feel like continuations. No humor, no fun and unlikable characters.
Doesn't look like the OGs are going to be in it more than a few scenes.
Night King ?
Elsa is far from Arendelle
Looks cool lols
The kids suck and they added that wife killer Patton Oswald
Ghostbusters: Wrath of the Lich King
Ghostbusters: A Cold Day In Hell
Hope Egon is in this ❤
Ghostbusters: Hell Freezes Over
This reminds me of Day After Tomorrow
This looks awesome.  I can't wait to see it.
GB is my favorite movie ever. Of all time… but Afterlife should’ve been it.  This… ugh. Cash grab dilution of the legacy.
Will it be woke cause of Patton Oswalt, ? That was poor casting...😢
looks boring
Trash Bill Murray must be hard up for money working with that cast
This film looks like it will be amazing! This is for all of us who grew up on the original film, pretending to design our own proton packs and busting some heads in a spiritual sense.
You know the ice is "evil" because it's really pointy. 🤤
Paul Rudd is living the dream, he gets to be Ant Man and a Ghostbuster
This doesn't look good.
Please let it be a villain other than Gozer! That prehistoric bitch has been taken downtown to many times.
Tanananat tanat 🎵 who u gonna call?
I thought afterlife was a great reboot to the series. Bringing people into the Ghostbusters lore with a nice mix of nostalgia and a new story new crew. And I'm happy to see that looks like everybody from afterlife is back in this one.
Vitaath the Shivering Death
Looks like it has potential...
looks REALLY stupid
No.
This looks like a good time. Can't wait to see it!
I'd waste money on this...
1:29 Uh Oh. Who do we need to call? Cause the bad AFTERtaste of 2016 is still fresh in our minds.🤨🤨🤨
Hollywood. Please stop already and make something original. Ffs.
Paul Rudd is a treasure.
Ghostbusters: Tropical Freeze
I got The Day After Tomorrow vibes seeing the ice freeze like that  . That movie did the exact same thing in the same setting
I don’t care what anyone says I LOVED Afterlife. This movie looks awesome
Yeah idk this doesn’t feel like Ghostbusters
No humans were "Kebabbed" during the making of this film
Paul Rudd my guy man doing his Ant Man laugh at the end 😂😂😂
I truly hope the movie is better than the trailer.
I just want a fun movie, it's been so long since i've had one to look forward to in the theaters.
That's a great concept! I hope the rest of the movie is as good as the trailer
2 minute trailer and the plot already makes no sense, are they frozen or scared to deletion? AND how do you see your own tear ducts? This is why nobody cared about the strikes.
Wish they'd stop pushing Kumail Nanjiani on us. He was half-decent in Silicon Valley, but that's about it.
Nice
Ghostbusters (1984) Ghostbusters II (1989) Ghostbusters (2016) (alt. timeline) Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021) Ghostbusters: The Return of Princess Elsa (2024)  I guess it's that time again when Hollywood starts bleeding this franchise dry.
Afterlife was awesome. Not like that trashy woke femunazi one we had with all women one. I hope this one will be awesome
Yup, I'm def gonna go see this!
I could get behind the 4 new ghostbusters if they become a team. Saying that, not sure about kids being ghostbusters but at least they have been through it before. I'm excited😁
Nice! But they should've titled it Ghostbusters: Death Chill.
Let thy frozen subzero empire begins in 2024
if this doesn't try to be a stupid trilogy i think it'll be a great movie
I love it! This movie, the old and new Ghostbusters team will be joining forces and take the fight to death chill an abominable spectre
An ice ghost? I swear I have defiently heard of that somewhere before.
200 million dollar budgets and too lazy to build actual sets.
Wait...WHAT?!!! They actually got Bill Murray to come back for this one after all the recent press about him crapping all over Ghostbusters 2?! REALLY?!!! Is this movie THAT good, or is Murray just so old that he's only about the paychecks now?
Mk movie producer didn't give enough money to sub zero so he tried his luck in ghostbusters 😂😂😂
I was not expecting a sequel to Afterlife. But go Ghostbusters!
I think it's cool that they are doing a crossover event of GhostBusters and Frozen. So Elsa instead of Gozer and Olaf instead of the marshmellow man? Cool... cool...
Tq Sony,for keeping Ghosties ALIVE....keep it goin...
@1:52 Elsa, is that you?!
Oooh, chills!  I liked Afterlife, and they got the whole crew back together, so I'm really looking forward to this!
How much more can you dilute this film series. Can't wait for this to flop
Hell yes!  Just don’t let Disney get their hands on it and eff it up!
Bring this on!! I’m ready for a new Ghostbusters
Okay. Okay I'm in!
This trailer radiates White supremacy.
WOOOO!! This trailer gave me chills! The original GB’s are Back with the cast from Afterlife.. Yes!! Finally a proper Ghostbusters  sequel. BRILLIANT 👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾
wow ❤
The beach scene is literally ninjago movie whenever garmadon attacks 🤣
Some of the cgi needs work
I know when they were filming this Canada for the most part it was all on fire and some of the things in New York for a bit sketchy. Can’t wait to see what they did.🎉
Gonna be one of the biggest movies of 2024 for sure!
who plays hubert? it sounds like adam goldberg
Elsa in real life.😂
Finally Sony understands the real Ghostbusters fan. This looks awesome. Can’t wait to see it.
I liked the part where they copy what they did with Indiana Jones.
I really hope Slimer appears in this!
Less Patton Oswalt and this could be a hit! 🤠👍
Cmon Hollywood try original ideas not reviving a frandchise that’s already established if y’all can’t do that then I hope Hollywood crumbles
Soo cool
Cruel Summer? Where is Daniel Larusso??
Busters Ready.... GO..!!!     _Whoops wrong movie._
Trailer is too short but has possibility with such a short clip!
Nope looks terrible.
I can’t wait
... seems legit.
Colombia, Just Don’t!
YES!!!!!!!!
I'm cautiously optimistic.  I want to love this.
I’m getting my tickets early! I missed the the theater release! Had to stream it!
Ready and waiting to see it
Slimer better be in this!!
looks interesting, but not so realistic that you'd be laughing at people dying by being frozen to death.  does that sound likely?  I don't imagine anyone reacting that way.
So we are going to continue to ignore that Ghosbusters was a snarky blue collar irreverent dark comedy, and not a family, nostalgia, warm feelings series? I hate what movies have become.
Mitch McConnell is the villain.
Ar-Rahman (Arabic: الرحمان, ar-raḥmān; meaning: The Merciful) is the 55th Chapter (Surah) of the Qur'an, with 78 verses (āyāt). ...
Graphically it looks great and the tone is spot on. But who casts these movies? You put Patton Oswalt in this, seriously? Who actually likes that little weasel? I have to say Finn Wolfhard is pretty darn meh as well. He’s just whiney. Gen Z is just almost devoid of confident movie star type actors.  Also, this is a movie made for children. I get it, they want a different target audience and are probably aiming for the kids of the  people who were young when the original released. However, an adult comedic ghostbusters would have been nice. The original had bits of raunchy humor and most certainly was not aimed at children.
i like how masculine men & feminine women are going out of style.....  but anyways....yeah cool trailer
I want 2008 CGI. not new CGI with AI editor 💀
This just bleeds Real Ghostbusters vibes. I could totally imagine this as a plot in the syndicated season, which is the highest compliment.
Heeeeellllll yesssss
Awesome ❄️ 👻❤️
Niceeeeee, the boys stayed!!!. I thought they might have moved on. Loved Afterlife, can't wait for this one.
The first one was fun, definitely watching this one too!
👻🥶👍
Amo a los cazafantasmas ❤😢
WHO YOU GONNA CALL.....                                              ...ghostbusters. You call the ghostbusters. Duh. What id you think I was gonna say?
This feels like it will genuinely be trash. Didn't like then 2016 reboot, but at least it understood that Ghostbusters is a comedy, even if it kinda tripped over itself on that front.
And none of spykes killed a people, Pegi 12, good luck my dear suckkkkkers /s
Just stop.....
Omg that's goooooooood ty Sony.
This is so "cool"
Its pathetic that they still don't understand the appeal of the original film.
Whhhyyyyy?!!?
YESSSSSSSS!
I’m gonna need one of those red coats!
SubZero empire
Looks like it has a diverse cast . That’s what’s most important when making movies.
Let's go! Can I order my tickets now?
I enjoy the irony of Stranger Things kids dressing as Ghost Busters for Halloween and now one of them is one.
Sub Zero 😀😀😀
Can't wait!
Saw the trailer on an ad without knowing what movie it was for, but I felt it was very Ghostbusteresque…lo and behold!  Love that this movie seems to have an original idea while maintaining the classic Ghostbuster tone
Patton Oswald?
This is A MUST SEE MOVIE, for me!!!!!!!!!
This is how you bring back a beloved series.
These sequels should have been made 20 years ago
Let me guess climate change
I too am excited for new [ Franchise Sequel/Prequel/Reboot movie]
Can’t wait let’s go ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
Here’s hoping Patton Oswalt is the villain and gets a more explosive death than the stay puff marshmallow man.
Will be garbage
Patton Oswalt got over defending Ghostbusters 2016 awful fast, didn't he?
what happened to the fat lesbians?
This looks like a massive box office failure. The effects already look bad and overused. How many times will people watch rubbish because the surviving actors are dangled like carrots?
This looks so cool!!!!!
YES
This looks sooo good. Very excited. Will be seeing this at the theater for sure.
At last! Ghostbusters: Tropical Freeze is here! ❄️🏝️
Stupid… after afterlife should’ve just turned into a series movies should’ve stopped.
LOVING IT!!!
Collect Call of Cthulhu vibes
Looks pretty good and does look a bit more like a ghostbusters movie than afterlife was (not that it wasn’t good, just felt a lil too different) but the sub title is stupid.  Sorry.  Sounds like a subtitle for the next Scorcher movie starring tugg speedman
1:02 ohhh lord have mercy
I don’t think this film understands Ghostbusters, the ghosts don’t kill in Ghostbusters, it’s a comedy.
Cannot fkn wait.
Anyone else get a stranger things vibe ?
LETS GO ❗️❗️
You have afraid no ghost sign of finale
Definitely interested!
Chills!!!
This looks great!!
Patton Oswalt in it means it'll be lame.
Looks good! But plot and villian reminds me of Ghosthunters: On Icy Trails. I thought Ghosthunters was a wannabe Ghostbusters, but now im wondering if they did it first with the concept of the villian! 😂
i just want the full trailer with the actual theme please :)
So again a teenager Ghostbusters movie, with 5 a 10 minutes of the real Ghostbusters we loved  so much from the first two Ghostbusters movie?  No thanks, i rather watch Ghostbusters (1984), and Ghostbusters 2 (1989) again and again.
I am loving this everything but Pat Oswalt he belongs in the 2016 universe also personally I kill his character off and fast and Pat Oswald if you are seeing this you suck and  you're really funny at all. So just stop trying.
Welcome back !
Ohhhhz. I love the red coats. That’s a cool take on a new look
우와 기대된다
Just light-years better than that girl power bullshit they made for no good reason at all...
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight Not a footprint to be seen A kingdom of isolation
Man do I want one of those jackets
This looks great
This looks GOODT! 👻
Looks like fun!
Afterlife was everything I wanted it to be. If this is half as good, it'll be a good one.
Alright, after seeing this, I’m definitely will watching it.
WHY!?!?
Love it hopefully this is the final nail in the 2016 coffin
Cool.
Put damnn ghostbusters theme to NeXT trailer !
The beginning of the trailer is the same as Do key Kong: Tropical Freeze
Please take Patton Oswald out of this movie please
I don't like the marvel humor, hope the movie is not all like that.
Like to see how this is taking it’s own direction instead of using nostalgia bait for marketing
How many people in the comments are real and how many are shills?
I can’t stop laughing at Paul Rudd’s reaction to the villain 😂
They came back to save the franchise!!
Not too sure about the plot of this movie?? I mean they could’ve gotten a villain from the animated series to be in this like Boogieman or Samhain.
Patton Oswald?…for the love of god why…pass
So hyped for this movie!!! Had no idea about this till it just now popped up on my feed and the name alone got me really excited! I loved afterlife and now the fact that the cast from that is returning with the ogs once again is getting me so hyped for 2024!!!
..... I like the fact that this is a real promo for a new movie and NOT. a fake promo that people make up like the goonies 2
Please give us Rick Moranis with Paul Rudd. Lol.
Looks great, it has for me some Stranger Things vibes and stranger things is very good too.
In the words of Dr. Venkman, "So be good! For goodness sake! Whooooaaaa, SOMEBODY'S COMIN'!"
Never forget Patton Oswalt funded his first wife's drug abuse lifestyle which caused her to overdose and die. So TLDR Patton killed his wife.
Mr Freeze sounds different in this film…
wow
🥹
hell yes.  I am there opening day in my ghostbuster suit
I honestly thought Vigo was gona be the bad guy but I’m loving this already hopefully this doesn’t get delayed till summer
That sot of ecto 1 was awesome! I think it was under appreciated in the originals, but they made it a great part of Afterlife.  I hope the same can be said for this.
Finally this is how you do a sequel you keep the same cast you ront change it up this is gonna be so damn good
Is that ..... Kel'thuzad at the end?
I'm glad y'all didn't go with the rumored Vigo reboot. I'm glad to see some original premises. "The Death Chill." Can't wait to watch this.
This looks unique enough to be good. Here, I was thinking this was a video game with that title.
Looks like trash!
Dunno. It promises to be a good movie. But previous was sooo baaad, I don't know if I can trust anymore
Cool 😎
When people say that they're "blood ran cold", I don't think this is what they meant
I like GB Afterlife, they continue the story in this new movie... SWEEETTT ❤
Ohh my God it's been so long since we've had a ghostbusters movie I'm so excited for Ghostbusters frozen Empire AHHH!
so excited about this
Tight!
Patton Oswald sucks.
I'm glad they're training up a new generation. This looks closer to what I wanted out of the last one.
Change the title to "Gostbusters : on ice" and I am in.
Looks awesome can’t wait to watch it for My Birthday   So awesome Paul Rudd being a Ghostbuster cool. 😊
The gang is back together.
Tear-a-bull
Paul Rudd was a good addition to the franchise.
Uh Oh Looks like Somebody is Selling Out🤯
I’m here for it🤷🏽‍♀️one of my favorite franchises however I’m going to definitely have to reserve judgment for AFTER
JAMES ACASTER
I love this already! Theres a scene with the car that was shot during the canada wildfire smoke in NYC that i hope made it in. Casey Neistat got a little on video.
Lissandra, is that you?!
I heard its Schwarzenegger reprising his role as Mr. Freeze
Gave me Real and Extreme Ghostbusters vibes. Im 99% in...1% out because of Patton.
Patton Oswalt is the only thing i don't like about this trailer.
ghostbusters extreme?
da ending.... literaly how i feelll
This looks amazing!
Oh we got kumail cringiani
Was diggin it. Then saw patton oswalt and thought dammit
Climate Change Ghostbusters lol
If this isnt the worst woke movie ever made I am a gay lion.
So far the only movie next year I’m hyped for!
What no Russians in Coney Island 🤣
This isn't really what I thought Ghostbusters 4 would be, but okay I'll take it since it has Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd.
Glad they didn't go with bringing back vigo idea and did something new.
I thought this was a goof. But no…
I was afraid this was only going to be a fan made trailer.
Bring back rick moranis pleaseeee
they had to go the nostalgia route for afterlife after the terrible 2016 version ..now we can go into something more original see yall in 2024
First one sucked so bad,more WOKE crap.
Krampus ?
Looks like another disappointment, was it that hard to get another 3 actors to play alongside Paul and the original cast? Haven't you learned nothing from Disney?
Hell yeah
Afterlife was and awesome one this looks excellent
Collab with Fortnite again I missed out on the cosmetics. This is a perfect opportunity
I wish Hollywood would stop barfing all over classics
Just like the "Halloween" franchise, they abuse of their good luck because they don't know when to stop! Someone makes a new installment out of pure love for the franchise in order to erase the damage of the previous one and give it a decent closure; a CLOSURE, but then that "closure" becomes a hit and they get greedy, then is no longer that promised closure, it becomes a new franchise and they will exploit it until they ruined it again making the purpose of the entire thing pointless and worthless; because they and us know very well that they won't stop until they fail. Who wants it to end as with failure? When was the last time they allow a franchise to end on a high note? And a big F.U. to Bill Murray for deciding to wear the costume, not once but twice, only after Harold Ramis died and not when he was alive insisting him to do it.
This feels new
this looks amazing
This is definitely one to watch at the theater!
"HEY GHOSTBAHSTAHS! VHAT KILL DE DINOSAURS? *DE ICE AGE!* "
Anyone else excited to find out who this chilling❄❄❄foe is??
Seems to be in good hands still. Take a lesson Disney/Marvel.
Winter is coming.
yyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
Reunión de salimos a las personas aaaaaaa?no
Gonna assume it sucks til further notice.
Thought I was watching Jaws at first.
That Looks Great To See it Yes
having the OG busters back in business with the kids is such a great move
So the Ghostbusters are coming the Day after Tomorrow?
I got chills watching this trailer ! 😁😁😎😎
This is looking like it will be a commercial success. The trailer, fan base, cast, etc. are forming a good recipe for success.  R.I.P The Marvels
I'm just so tired of kids in these movies
In Ghostbusters: Afterlife they dedicated it to Harold Ramis  Now in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire they dedicated it to Ivan Reitman
Where is the avenger !!???? 😂😂😂😂 Because antman is right there
Not won over by the trailer. It doesn't look good to me from it. Someone described it as Afterlife meets the Day After Tomorrow which looks about right. I hope it has a better plot than just "Villain makes it cold."
So far this looks like one of those environmental disaster films, not like a Ghostbusters film. They really should've shown more Ghost stuff in this. I'm hoping the Ghost teased at the end has a larger presence in the movie.
The villain in the end of the trailer is 100% Lissandra from League.
More like “ghoul” summer….
Egon please make an appearance again.  For sure in the end credits Jason pays tribute to his Dad Ivan Reitman. During Afterlife it was for Harold Ramis.
"Afterthought"... oh, sorry! I mean, "Afterlife" received great praise by everyone, and I absolutely hated it! This trailer looks so underwhelming. Why the hell did the real ghostbusters 3 get a video game treatment? It should have been the third Ghostbusters film! Turn THAT game into a proper movie with really nice CGI. Call it "Ghostbusters 3" or "Ghostbusters: Hellbent" and tweak it so it can softly lead up to the "Afterthought"... um, Afterlife's plot. "Afterlife" can pass as a fourth installment. Making "Frozen Empire", part 5.
looks awesome! Enjoyed the last Ghostbusters movie. Can't wait!
Yes please 👌
Should have called it Ghostbusters: Death Chill. Frozen empire sounds like some tropic thunder scorcher sequel.
They should have left this alone from ghost busters 2 smh
Hell yeah
Is it weird to mention I had a dream about Ghostbusters prior to this being in my recommended?
A little too much "Day after tomorrow" vibes.  Hope its good.  Just watched afterlife recently for the first time and it was enjoyable with the same feel as the original 2 so I have some high hopes for this one.  They did kind of use the same storyline from part 1 for Afterlife so I'm curious to see how a new original threat will be.
Where's Melissa McCar....
Paul Rudd is a goofball. I shall watch.
As long as the new kids and old team are in it, I’m going to see it!!
Let it go!
I was trying to hold out on watching Afterlife for free on a streaming platform that I'm subscribed to, but damn... I may just have to buy the damn movie on blu-ray on catch up to this amazing reassurance of a beloved franchise
This looks great.
I'm so excited
Loving this! I’ll definitely be seeing this in theaters and hope this is good. I have a idea if they wanna do a Ghostbusters 5. I was thinking of doing something with a mix of Ghostbusters, Nightmare Before Christmas, & Corpse Bride.
SOMETHING ORIGINAL!! LETS GOOOOO
*nods* I am approving of this new trailer, something new and original a Ghostbusters movie we deserve post AfterLife
This is gonna be awesome. Pumped up for this 😃
Glad to see the boys are back. That last Ghostbusters was some matriarchal p.c. bullshit😒
Seeing this trailer and seeing afterlife... This is the first major movie in a long time I actually want to go out of my way to see! It's nice to see original stories making a comeback... Thank God for Sony.... Maybe Disney needs to take notes!
Awesome!
Please don't go woke. All I'm asking.
Paul Rudd at the end XD XD XD  That was awesome!
It looks like Trevor might be the main character of the story. And it might be about him trying to become a good ghostbuster
I love how they treat the original characters with respect! This is how you keep old and new fans happy and how you successfully pass the franchise to a new generation. “Scream” also did it right. Take notes Kathleen Kennedy!
1:51 hey it’s Lissandra from League of Legends 😂😂😂
THE REAL boys are back !!!
Damn when did Ghostbusters get so Dark!! Now a lot of characters can actually die and in the worst possible way 🥶
winter is coming
So it's the day after tomorrow part 2? Patton hasn't been good since Reno 911
Oooh....Please be good, please be good, please be good!
YES! I was hoping Afterlife got a sequel! The original Ghostbusters was my very first movie going experience at 4 years old... I live this franchise!!!
I'm  there!!!!! Let's  go Ghostbusters! (showed my age with that one)
I'm excited for this movie
This is cool 😎
It feels like Afterlife was to bring back the live and hype around the franchise and bring closure to the og stories, and now Frozen Empire sets to expand and evolve, and bring in new storylines
Gay and lame.
is that the New Jersey Devil at the end?
Directed by the guy who did Monster House?! I know lots of people are sold on that. I'm kinda interested what the scene shot of June 7th is gonna look cuz of the wildfires polluting the air turning the sky orange. That would be a killer and appropriate spooky atmosphere for a scene if they kept it in! Hopefully they did.
The CGI on the ice and the taxi being lifted looks absolutely horrendous
That looks pretty terrible actually
Aye it’s Lissandra from league 😂
so glad to see the ogs sign up for the second one! i don't even care if they're only in it for a minute, i'm hyped. faith in humanity has been moderately restored for now.
Looks like the original Ghostbusters are barely in it. Again.
Just finished watching afterlife and after watching this im excited. Glad they moved onto something original with the og cast mixed in with the new
Shut up and take my money
Its a hot one in new jersey:also the movie. This is the first time in new york history. So this takes place in either new jersey or new york
Not really sure about how I feel…
After watching afterlife which I loved as it was like a tribute to Harold and fan service...  This looks good to me. Like something I'll enjoy watching.
Looks so cool ! No pun intended I promise.
Winter is coming
Why Patton Oswalt?
Can't wait! Loved afterlife
This is gonna be so...cool!  Definitely better than any Ghostbusters movie that may have come out in 2016, that never existed.
This title is literally a Barbenheimer Joke.
yess! new story, new original villain, please don't bring back the OG's just to kill them! looks great
Can’t wait!
Hey, Patton, is your wife in the movie?
I wonder how much wokeness is gonna be in this one
Death freeze? Better...heat 'em up. I'll show myself out now
Yes, Have to see this one.
Was that laugh at the end a reference to Santa?
remember when ghostbuster was a blue collar sci-fi comedy? I miss those days.
Aesthetically looks good…but kids with proton packs and certain casting … ehhh. JMO.
Dammit, still have to watch this 30 year old playing a tween...
Yeaaah... Afterlife was a shameless and sleazy fan service disgrace, so...I'll pass.
MY THERORY IS RIGHT HAHAHAHAHAHAH
I can't wait to see it!!!❤❤
This looks like an Avengers level threat glad Spider-Man is there !!
Seems repetitive
Finally a movie worth getting excited about.  Been awhile
Why are there kids in this movie? Seriously, why?
I'm here for it
The ecto-1’s badass practical stunts just bring a tear to my eye, these freakin guys slammed the station wagon body on a corvette unibody so it could perform the stunts practically, legit🔥
Looks terrible. Hollywood has never made worse movies than it does today. Can they make something original for once?
There are some movies you are not supposed to remake and this is 1 of them the only good movies of this series are the originals.
Afterlife was fantastic.  Got high hopes for this one.
It’s so so so so so so so so so so good
This looks cool! I just hope they have the "Ladies Ghostbusters" show up!!  ...okay, no, I don't.
This looks 🆒 🥶
RIP Ghostbusters. another flop.
" I am Sub Zeto "
Since they brought back Gozer, maybe its got something to do with Vigo or a villian from the cartoon.
Niceeeeeeee !!!!!
cool trailer. Could of done without patton though. We don't like him and he don't like us.
Omg omg omg omg omg !!!!!!
why Patton? We want Rick not this creepy guy
I think this Ghostbusters 4 has what it takes to fully change it up a bit!! They finally got a new villain, finally using NEW SUITS, old cast is back but supporting and a new team!
It needs more female Ghostbusters
At a time when super hero movies are starting to falter… this is perfect timing for the nerds who feel we are lacking some good movies to watch. This looks sick as hell.
lots of bots promoting this trash.
I see Paul, I click like.
Yeee 🎉🎉🎉
Hey, it's the same Ferris wheel the Ghostbusters used to destroy C'thulhu!
That was cool i can wait to see Ghostbusters Frozen Empire it going to be Awesome 😀😎👍🤘❤👻❄
They had Gozer in Afterlife, was kinda hoping they'd face off against Vigo in the second one. Oh well, still can't wait to see it!!!
Damn, this is got me pretty excited!  I’m 39 years old and grew up on the original Ghostbusters and now I have a five-year-old son who is almost 6 years old and he loves Ghostbusters and has seen the cartoon and also watch the original movie and after life, so this looks like this will be really cool!  Plus you have to consider the fact that the studios originally had to really tame down Aykroyd‘s original vision, so maybe this is his chance to finally really amp up the story, like he always wanted to!
Im pumped.
When you found an asset with ice textures and couldn’t figure out what to do with them
So happy to see this coming! A truly spooky and original villain, the kids, the oldies, that damned car, everything looks fantastic! A spoonful of fan service and a ladle or two of new stuff. Awesome!
The Ghostbusters After Tommorow!!
The lion statues from The new York public library in GB 1 comes alive in this one..Noice💯💯💪💪💪💪🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥😃😃😁😳
This film is definitely taking a different direction with what we’re used to for these films. A new villain, an Armageddon tone, and an apocalyptic winter in the summer, this feels like a new Ghostbusters Timeline.
Looks OK we shall see.
Lets go
Hearing the ecto-1's siren always make me feel warm and fuzzy inside. But the cold from the effects was a different matter.
That start up exhaust note 😏💪
Well, who you gonna call?
paul rudd was a good choice
I think I recognized that music.
Looks awesome!
Finally something decent in the theathers. YAHOOOOOOOOO
Yep gonna see this day it opens. Loved the last one, this one looks equally good. 🎉
looks mid
I love how much Paul Rudd is enjoying himself in these movies.
Nope. Because Patton Oswald and Kumail Nanjiani are AIDS.
Jesus I hope they fix the CGI before its released because the animation here looks worse than it did in Ant Man 3
Looks good!
Meh.
This is going going to be the 40th anniversary of the original one back in 1984.
Ngl, the frozen theme is a bit random, but maybe in the movie, it will explain
Perfect us of Bananarama here!!!!!
you can tell there is a writers strike...
Hoping Bill,Dan,Winston are more then just cameos but this looks really good I enjoyed afterlife
Not the biggest Ghostbusters fan, but I'll be damned if that siren didn't get my hype through the roof.
Sure, keep kicking the horse y’all killed with the last movie.
They seemed to get it right when they were aimed at adults and you let kids watch them. Hasn’t gotten better since they flipped the formula around.
Cool...
The opening reminded me of Sharknado 1. Not sure that’s a good thing.
I just got back from watching Afterlife, and needless to say that now having watched all three Ghostbusters movies so far (Hell no I'm not counting that mess back in 2016), I'm prepared to watch this one.
THE WAY I SCREAMED
WHHAAATTT!!??!!  I didn't even know this was being made!!! I am all in!
YES YES YES!
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMETHING INSANE IN THE GHOSTBUSTERS WORLD
Wonderful. 👻
Definitely going to this
Nah bro. I wanted to see people get impaled by them icicles and screaming in agony 😂🤣
Was hoping to catch a glimpse of James "Dessert Boy" Acaster in the trailer.
Should have ended it with the afterlife. Was a perfect end. Now they are messing it up like ghostbusters 2. Hollywood just does not know how to leave it be. GB2 Caddyshack 2 The hangover 2 3 T3 4 5 6 .... Leave classics alone and so on. The list is so long. Just let it be.
I hope it won't get delayed.
I can’t wait to collect these ❤️👍
so this is what mike from stranger things did after escaping Hawkins, Indiana?
Yuck Paton Oswald
Yes Paul this will be my celebration movie man time to start calls guys sorry
Rick Moranis?
Great!
Afterlife was an incredible film, and this looks to continue the trend!
Uh oh
I hope it's good but we'll see.
But still....I wanna know.where the hell are the RGB flight suits dammit.come on Jason they have to be in there
Geostorm 2 looks crazy
So Ghostbusters are fighting climate change now? Cool?
1:53 my excitement for this!
Looks awesome except one thing
Personally I wanna see the ghost from the cartoon with the Pumpkin head
"Who left the fridge open?!?"
YES!!!
Daaaam noooooo.Lucky gets Frozen in this one 🥶🥶🥶🥶😮😮😮she def looks like she scared to death bro no cap
I'm really excited to see Ghostbusters again and now in a new FROZEN adventure, this is going to get really good
Remember when Ghostbusters was just a funny comedy with ghosts from the 80s? Now it’s Marvel.
Wait what?!  Either I'm out of the loop since Covid killed movie theaters or these guys actually succeeded in slipping this one in under the radar.
WE NEED SLIMER
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
I was waiting for Bill Murray to say “It’s time for the Jedi to end…..” at the end of the trailer.   This looks amazing and I loved afterlife!  Suck it disney!!!
Them still standing there while I'd be running lol
this looks good
Is this going to be another stupid kids movie like the last one?
This looks amazing
All of the young men look so effeminate and all of the young women look so masculine
Omg I am so friggin excited 😍😍😍
Now this is a movie i am looking forward to seeing. Growing up, i enjoyed the Ghost Busters movies, but this has me excited. I don't need another trailer ,  to go see the movie.
wow thought this was a fan made trailer. hell yeah let's do it
Is only Year 2024
Well seems better than marvel so far😢
This trailer was an unexpected treat! Excited for this one!
I sure hope this movie isn't chalk full of wokeness.
What's the song at the very beginning? It's totally stuck in my head...
Says Frozen Empire.... didn't see Elsa even once.
Patton Oswald... jfc sigh
2016 ghostbusters is crying 😂
Definitely in. Let's get bustin'.
Still haven't seen the last one.
Oh yeah.. McKenna Grace . I like the phoebe character
Patton Oswalt ruins everything.
OH MY!!!
To see Ecto 1 in her full glory!!!
This looks good!
Wokebusters
Es hermoso
Ivo Shandor the architect could have been a great new villain, but he got killed off straight away in Afterlife. 😮
Take my money now!
I can't wait to see this movie.  The last one was freaking awesome❤️❤️❤️
I like the name, frozen empire and New York's nickname is Empire State.
I think it will be good. But I'd like the women ghost busters as well. If you made a movie with women you need to add them.
It looks like it’s worth going to the theater to see.
Looks gay
Top Gun Maverick, Cobra Kai and Ghostbusters are great examples of how you continue keeping a franchise alive with original and new characters! Something new and fresh but yet familiar. Can't wait to watch this!
I'm onboard as long as it has a similar philosophy to Afterlife. It seems like every piece of media nowadays is trying to preach to you, and the minute this movie tries to do that, it'll flop. But as long as they don't, it'll be good
Hollywood never letting an IP die and rest in piece.
Let's get that Melissa McCarthy return we've all been waiting for. 😊
Ghostbuster: frozen ape
There a something strange and chilly in the neighborhood
Plzz add the classic nostalgic ghost buster intro.👻🚫
“The last thing you see… is your own tear ducts freezing up.”  That sounds utterly horrifying. I love it
Uumm. Like the last one. Not a funny scene in the whole movie.
Just "soon". This whole teaser with a lot of finished looking sfx, but not even a vague release window? Is it because of the strike?
Cool 🥶😎👍
Ghostbusters are Back in a New York Mood, Baby!!!
Who was the older lady using Rays spectral goggles?  His daughter or something?
Trailer looks awesome, but my wife requests more cute marshmallow people.
Looks bad
Ghost of climate change? Les jus hope not.
Will it be as good as Afterlife?  Maybe not, but it still feels like Ghostbusters.
Winter is coming.
Gozers sister?
Wait, new york has beaches?
"Ghostbusters: The Day After Tomorrow".
Im still hoping for the Extreme Ghostbusters characters
Honest opinion. Looks lame 🤷‍♂️
Sony Please please be non woke and keep it good like after life... My bar been set so low now any movies with no woke crap will be good. I have an uneasy feeling over this seeing Sony refusal to stay off weirdos woke crap in games.
Well.... the tone, right from the start, feels right. While I don't really care for the new cast, Afterlife was a solid, well-made film, so I'm feeling optimistic.  =)
Who you gonna call?
Nope.
Looks like trash lmao
Pass
Let it go… Let it go…
Is it me or am I noticing wat type of shirt Ray is wearing while telling pheebs n podcast it's the death chill. Isn't that the same shirt he wore. In GB 1 wen they first met Dana n wen he first pulled up in Ecto 1
I already hate this movie
LOOKS AWESOME!
I like where ghostbusters is going . This is something completely original.
I wasn't a fan of afterlife so i hope this one is better
what is it?  "australia"
Praying for the Miles Morales cameo!
I like Paul Rudd.
If this is where the legacy of ghostbusters is heading im not complaining.
I really thought this was just another fan made trailer.
4 (four) amazing Ghostbuster Movies: Ghostbuster 1, Ghostbusters 2, Ghostbusters Afterlife and now  GHOSTBUSTERS: FROZEN EMPIRE! just amazing.
OMG. I would ask why and how Hollywood has fallen so hard but I know the answer. It's this worthless generation in their 30's right now running the show.
Old guy gets defrosted and first thing he’ll say is “Thank You Spider-Man”.
0:09 This is the part that’s telling me there are several drug dens nearby.
Thank you Jason and Gil! RIP EGON.
Can you please edit Patton Oswalt out of this movie before you release it!
Rick Moranis NEEDS to be in this movie!!!!
Awesome. 😎
Please for the love of God,  Don't put Patton Oswald in the movie.
PLANNED PROGRAMMING
I know everyone liked the last one ,but i wish they could have got a cast of adults and had a semi adult vibe like the original.
This looks like trash. Ghostbusters Afterlife sucked too.
Why does that shadow at the end remind me of Kel'Thuzad from Wow?  Trailer looks good though
i hope Joel makes another Super Ghostbusters album for this one
Ugh. F you, SONY PICTURES. You just keep butchering classic films for a cash grab.
where are the token fembot ghostbusters.?
I think when Paul did is laughing something is coming to help them .Not Egon something else.
👻 I cannot wait!! 🎉
I love Paul Rudd 😂❤
And a new generation gets introduced to Bananarama.
Okay. Got me. I smiled. This is looking for two-for-two.
Wow this looks so cool 1:35 aaaaaaand you ruined it
*Soooo, it's a comedy?* I can't tell.
oh great another one already 😅
Just no
Hype!
Ummmmm…….why?
I miss it when busting makes me feel good, the EPA was too extrema, and it was 2016.
Yes! Hell has frozen over! Weve got a new ghostbusters film!
Patton Oswalt is encouraging. He probably ghost wrote it as he is been known to do and thank goser if so. That last one was choppy mess of a film.
Oh heck yeah! Can't wait, love all the OGs are in it and all the new cast!
Can’t wait for the Elsa cameo
I cant wait but I dont like that little fat Goldbergs voice over guy. Ive run into him a couple of times and he isnt very polite.
There are only 2 Ghostbusters movies.
This looks a lot better than Afterlife
Can't wait.......
Anyone remember the Sandman from the cartoon?
Kinda wish they got someone more likeable than Patton Oswalt.
"All right we're out of ideas again, throw the darts." **THWACK** " Ghostbusters... and...." **THWACK**  "....The Day After Tomorrow?" "Ship it."
WIPEN SIKEL
*Making money from nostalgia never gets old.
The fact that they put Cruel Summer in the first half of this video was phenomenal I am so so excited to see this movie big Ghostbuster fan for life not missing this one 😊❤🎉🎉
This came out of nowhere and I couldn’t be more excited!!!
I may cry if there's a Rick Moranis Cameo 😢
Yessssssss! This is wonderful! I can't wait!
Where the hell do i get those red winter coats?! I WANT
I'm looking forward to it
Kingo and Ant-Man joining forces with the Ghostbusters against Evil Elsa. 😎
"In this universe, there is only one absolute: Everything freezes."
Ice in July? That's easy: the climate change
Yes!!!  I loved this trailer!
I'M DEFINITELY GOING 2 SEE THIS  !!! BOOYAKASHA  !🦸🏻‍♂️🦸🏻‍♀️👈🏾👻🚫👈🏾👊🏽💥👊🏽💥👊🏽💥👊🏽💥👈🏾❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😀👌🏾👍🏾
Now THIS looks like a Ghost Busters I can get behind!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 ready see this movies look like going be real good
Christmas movies Halloween
@stanger311 is right!!! But where's Annie Potts too?
Ghostbusters afterlife 2 movie summer turn to winter ❄️🥶
Elsa is coming
Imagine someone with flip flops that day
I saw _'Ghostbusters: Afterlife'_ multiple times in the theater and have it on Blu-ray because it was well made AND it was respectful to the continuity of the first two films.  This one is definitely on my 'must see in the theater' list.
Looking forward to it, but please, stop casting Patton Oswalt in nerd/geek roles.         Better yet, just stop casting him.
excited
Please, just... make a fun movie
Looking decent
Paul Rudd is the man! If anyone can help keep Ghostbusters from giving up the ghost, it's him. Dude is one of the most likeable people in Hollywood.
A young-gen version of Ghostbusters?   okay, I dig it.  I'll watch this one
I hope they lean more into thriller or horror movie than comedy like this trailer did.
Pass ... yawn .... we didn't need a sequel.  Literally no one wanted this .  WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR GHOSTBUSTERS  2016 SEQUEL  !!!! THAT IS WHAT WE ALL WANT !!!
why did you that
Finally a good movie..
I hope the franchise isn't slipping back to stupidity.
Anyone else wonder what they got under the hood of Ecto-1? I mean it's a modified hearse with a bunch of equipment mounted to the roof and inside, and still has the power to do burnout 180's?
Whew....at some point I thought there will be a Disney Frozen, Elsa - crossing the Ghostbusters universe 😂
They didn’t put a woman in it and make her gay? .. how dare they
The ghost of climate change👻👻
that's pretty good
So this is the movie "2012" remake? With everything freezing 😢
Until this trailer, I've realized that every Ghostbuster movie has just been a rehash of the original. This movie actually feels like a new venture. A new threat, but with memorable characters to tackle it, of course. A breath of fresh, icy air.
2016 movie is better
Man, I can't believe we're now about to get a *FIFTH* Ghostbusters movie (yes, I'm counting the reboot as one, deal with it). I still remember back when we only had *two.* Feels like a lifetime ago at this point.
Looks like more Panderverse type stuff
It's official. I'm calling it before I even see it. There are more good Ghostbuster movies than there are bad ones. Looking at you GB2 and that awful remake.
Looks awesome!!!!!+ 🎉🎉🎉
Whatever, NEXT!!!!
This looks dope and original  carnt wait
Chills. Literally chills.
This looks like a fun movie, but have to wait and see though.
Nice!!
Hell yea 👻
Paul Rudd's character should have been Dana's son, Oscar. He should have been one of the new ghostbusters at least. I'm not sold on the idea that kids are using the proton packs and busting ghosts. It may work in a cartoon but not live action. They could have been 10 years older maybe. I hope much of the classic GB score is there, memorable ghosts, good comedy with actually scary horror elements. Use NYC right, it can be very atmospheric and full of mood. Also, where is the epic theme music to get most of us fans pumped in the trailer.
Atleast it not vigo.
HELL YEAHHH!!
Stop it
Ghostbusters 4: Winter Is Coming
crueeeeeel summmmmmerr
Awesome
Looks fun! I'm in.
Okay, Ice Demon ghostie actually looks menacing. And that hasn't been done since Vigo (although I was young back then so that may have contributed to that). So, I hope that we are similarly "like the buzzing of flies to him!"
Literally seeing this before watching yhe masterpiece of afterlife again with my family who hasn’t seen it yet. HYPE
this should be an interesting film, hopefully!
Gonna watch Afterlife because this teaser trailer got me EXCITED!!!
this probably gonna be movie of the year 🔥👻
It's an original storyline and it look so cool🤩
Afterlife was exceptional! High hopes for this one
I'm just happy they aren't rebooting the movies. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
My hopes were up, then I saw the cast……. I might still see this movie but not in the theaters
So climate change is now the threat over the usual paranormal activity, eh?  Yep, everything is "theater" these days... especially the stuff they try to pass in real life as "non-fiction" via certain special-interest medias and institutions.
Hell yeah take my money!!
Years gone by the batmobile changes....this hearse still working😆
A family that slays together stays together.  It does feel like it could tickle some woke rubbish, i hope that's not the case, this appears to have been OK'd ny the real ghostbusters, so my hopium is high.
You know who should be P.O.'d and come back for revenge?  The guy Ray was shocking in 1.   "You!"
Why is there a girl??? in a ghostbuster suit
I got chills pun intended! this is awesome
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaa I am the biggest ghost busters fan EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I enjoyed Afterlife even if I wasn't a huge Ghostbuster fan.  This looks like even more fun!
WHHAATT 😳 yo I'm definitely going to see this one for real
People who go for this should try 1997's "Batman and Robin" starring Arnie as Mr Freeze
Seriously guys, let the past stay in the past, is it not possible to create new original histories?
I would prefer if they got some really funny comedian guys in there, that knew how to improv. The original movie was good mostly because of that.
I can not wait so excited
Avenger threat level
Looking at the theme of this movie  they gotta give bill Murray the line "heat em up"
Wait. In Afterlife, they hinted that there was going to be a Ghostbusters franchise similar to McDonalds. I hope they didn’t forget that.
So it seems like it took a woke reebot and an "fanservice" movie to get back to the original series with the actual original characters we liked. Who would think treating the original material well would be so hard...
R.I.P. Ghostbusters! They have been taking so many Ls since the original first 2 films and this movie isn't going to help that narrative SMH
1:28  judging by the horns I would say they would face krampus right there.
Looks good
Hope it’s not woke.
Is anyone gonna mention the great Patton Oswalt
NYC isn't the only thing being frozen. That freshly restored Ecto-1 doing a power slide u-turn gave me the chills. 🥶😍
wauw , super cool , love it
Nice to know Bernie Sanders will play a ghost in this one.
It seems like the spanglers are living up to the ghostbusters legacy
I'm here for it. Afterlife surprised me and I'm always happy to see the guys back together.
I thought it was call global warming
jasons tee of with this series was tiger woods like. i hope he does just as well on the fairway.
Something totally random I noticed: the proton stream waves are traveling back towards the particle thrower instead of away from it. A nod to the ‘84 movie special effects, if you watch the hotel Sedgwick Slimer capture scene.
NO SLIMMER? 😢
Take my money! *Slaps debit card on counter repeatedly.*
Looks pretty sick
I’m so down
Is this the first AI generated feature film?
Looks good so far...here's to hoping it is and we get another good installment of Ghost Busters! 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
With Rick recently coming back to movies I really hope he shows up! This looks like a cool concept and I really enjoyed the breath of fresh cast from Afterlife. Looking forward to this one
Im so tired of movies rebooting and putting kids in adult roles.
the Wokebusters!  I ain't afraid of no wokie!
Do they ever learn!?! 🙄
I cannot wait for this movie to come out I loved Afterlife. loving the og's are in it and liking the new villain feels like Samhain vilain like maybe that's just me
Sooooo excited for this!!! Afterlife was a great way to wrap up the original story’s
Oh my goddddd
This is real, right? That some fan made thing? Compared to all the crap coming out of Disney, Afterlife was awesome. I really hope this is real.
Really surprised Bill Murray came back for another one.
Looks cool, BUT, Patton Oswalt?? Really???
So this was all being filmed during the SAG-AFTRA and Writer's Guild Strikes.  Hmm.
Ghost twin towers? Lol
Can not wait !!!!!!  Buying my tickets now !!!!  Everybody grab ya proton packs !!!
Ghostbusters: Rise of the Lich King
Nu Shooz
Nope. Should have stopped with Afterlife. Now everyone has a proton pack? Were those the awful female Ghostbusters in that one quick shot?!? If so get ready to see this BOMB
This paid-for top comments are something else
Another flop this movie is not going to do good. lol
Good to see they finally giving RESPECT for the IP. Unlike the "all-female" gender swap - like the evil Kathleen Kennedy says on South Park, "put a chick in it and make her gay!" - trope.
actually looks really good
Wonder what big bad they are dealing with this time (Gozer was trapped in Afterlife). Also think it's cool that Phoebe's teacher is a Ghostbusters.
Why the f is Oswald Patton in this? Sheesh
So, it won't just be a shameless nostalgia showcase this time?  Color me cautiously intrigued. 🤨
Love it!
Reminds me of something out of RGB or XGB. That'd the vibe I'm getting.
Patton Oswalt?!? Let's gooooo!!!
I thought the last film captured something of the 80's feeling. Was prepared not to like it, did go off the rails slightly towards the end, lets see what this one offers...  'Bustin makes me feel good.
Omgggg I can’t wait to see it and watch it ❤❤❤I love finn
I got this as an ad bit couldn't skip because it was so captivating! I can't wait to see the movie!
This came out of nowhere but I am not disappointed!
I like that it’s going the Extreme Ghostbusters Route
Wow 8 hours ago!
I hate everyone in the cast except for the OG ghostbusters... 👎 It's clear that we will never see a cool and gritty adaptation of the ghostbusters in our lifetime.
This is going to go so hard
This is donkey Kong tropical freeze 😅😂😂
Itlooksokay,Ilikedthe afterlife!
So it's 2012 with ghosts. How neat. 🙄
Fundies are going to be protesting again
Movies need warmth and humanity and most importantly good JOKES. This looks terrible and I enjoyed afterlife somewhat (it was better by comparison to the reboot before it)
Honestly glad that were getting another movie, and that we may actually see a transition to a new team from the OG's so that there can be more movies, cause there's a lot to pull from for basic ideas.
I dig it. Feels a bit dark though. Has anyone actually died in a ghostbusters movie? I think maybe 2 people in the last one depending how you count (avoiding spoilers). I hope they don't forget the comedy. Not sure anyone really wants a Ghostbusters horror movie (at least not a majority).   If I had to guess, the frozen folks thaw out when the big bad gets captured...I don't see how this could be a comedy any other way.
THIS NEEDS TO STOP!!! BLEGH 🤮
Who is casting this movie? Find another gig.
The world will be at war. Every nation will have nukes flying into them. Good luck filling those seats.
Hell yeah
The last one really disappointed, I hope this one makes up for it. 🙏🏽😭
Can't wait
Umm..Shouldn’t there be a lot of impaled people all over New York from the sharp ice shards? Lol
Kumal Nanjiani and Patton Oswald are the kiss of death. They are box-office poison.
Hell yes😎
Stranger things again😒
HOW CAN I LIKE THIS 9,999,999 MORE TIMES.
Yessssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will be there in Theater for this !!!! It's beautiful 😳🤯😁
This has been on the shelf for a while finally glad to see to it come out
Gratz Sony, you, "put a chick in the lead and made her gay."  Who says you would be left behind by Disney ensuring your studio goes bankrupt too.  This wasn't made for me, so neither will I spend a penny on it either.  Given 99% of the population are normies I wish you luck jangling keys having a few white men old enough to be ded already, and without a conscious to sell their likenesses making more Western Cultural destruction of our myths, legends heroes and heroines, in cameos to try to fool the normies into wasting their money on this.  Normie boycotts work, because _we_ are legion.  You're lot couldn't fill a football stadium globally.  Get back to me how worshipping Baphomet works out for ya'
finally something original and not gozer again
This looks great!!!
Right on I can work with this looks pretty great so far
Can not wait !!!!!!  Buying my tickets now !!!!  Everybody grab ya proton packs !!!
I thought afterlife was great. Glad to see a sequel ❤❤
Not a fan of Ghostbusters kids.
Not gonna lie. Looks better than the Long Night in the final season of GoT.
Thought global warming was the threat
Who’s directing it ?
Do you know what would be cool? If they have a movie where they bring all the different Ghostbusters' teams from all the movies, even the bad ones, like some Endgame battle royal. Then they would have to fight the hardest entity they've ever faced. (maybe there could be different Ghostbuster units in different cities?)
Only this time its different.
Cool!
I am a huge Ghostbuster fan, but where are the ghosts in the trailer?
I have to go to the regal😃🥶
Where’s the girl version of GB?
I feel like the CGI could be a little better, but I’m excited to see this. The last one was really good 🤞🏻
I haven't even seen Afterlife yet this trailer was chilling and cool. I love how they are taking the frozen from fear aspect as a literal premise and presenting it in an eerie style. Then Bill Murray back with Paul and Finn, very much involved makes it full-on Ghostbusters 👻🚫 5:10am
Afterlife was the perfect bridge. A way to honor the past and introduce a new generation of ghostbusters. This might be what gets me to go to a theater again.
Nobody give a damn this francies, Sony.
I almost wanna believe this won't be garbage.
I think this is cool to have the original ghostbusters as advisors and passing the torch. Similiar to extreme ghostbusters where egon was the mentor.
I'm just tired of everyone treating children like heros and as valuable as a grown adult.
Looks ok, but seeing Paul Rudd makes me wish they’d paired him with Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, and Benedict Cumberbatch as the new Ghostbusters team.
Fun, But Halloween was last week lol
An original story in New York, the original Ghostbusters are present! I’m excited! Afterlife was pretty decent. This looks even better imo.
Oh hell yeah.
Ill stay sceptical for now but hope for the best.
STOP RUINING BELOVED FRANCHISES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
oh no
Awesome!
INCOMING FROZEN GARBAGE !!
Are we going to have to wait for 3 trailers again to get the theme?
Now that is absolutely gorgeous afterlife was awesome and that will be even better 2 worthy films that really get me exited 👑🔥not like ghostbusters who u gonna call that was a sin 💀
must watch
Ok...I'm in. Excellent trailer. Afterlife was a pretty solid film. Hopefully this is a worthy sequel.
😮...🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Not that I mind but I’ve always hoped they tackle a Cthulu like Story from the Animated series.
The 2020s frame of mind is to straight up deny everything. This is a nostalgia film. Not a bad thing. The original ghostbusters with the original setting. With a cast of kids for the kids. Nostalgia film, how is it NOT a Nostalgia film? Just make an original film with original design. Same actors as first film. Same setting. Same vehicle. Same ghost logo. A nostaligia film.
You lost me at Patton Oswalt.
Bananarama -Cruel Summer
Looks like they figured out after the first one that Rudd should be a Ghostbuster
Stop just stop seriously that money could be spent on actual things that matter not a bunch of ragtag unskilled films
Oh great, another rehashed movie. D- for creativity.
Thanks, I hate it.
Oh my god🤩
It looks great for sure but if it is true that Sigourney Weaver has not been contacted to reprise her role, I have personally lost interest. The characters introduced in the Afterlife movie are fine but why is it so difficult to have all three surviving veteran Ghostbusters as well as Dana and Janine in at least one scene interacting together (and it would have been great if they could convince Rick Morranis to appear as well)? In fact, why can't both Dana and Janine be more involved in the organisation and the plot? Filmmakers nowadays do not seem to understand what fans want to see. There are ways to integrate both old and new characters in modern sequels. I am not much of a Star Wars fan and I did not see the last two movies of the Disney trilogy but I can understand why fans were complaining that there was no scene of Luke, Hans ansd Leia together; this is why I went to watch the first movie of the Disney trilogy and it did not deliver.
Hollywood should remake "The Fly"
Ned Stark was right, winter is coming!  the night king has returned?
Can we appreciate that Winston hasn't aged in comparison to Ray/Peter?
Why ... Just ... why ...
This is going to be horrible.
How big do you think that bag of cash was for Bill Murray to commit to this in record time?
Plz do the boogieman returns!!!! I wish upon a star, maybe one day
Sweet!!!
Heck yeah!!
Elsa's gone rogue again.
Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!
I'll pass.
I’m very excited for this
Looks pretty chill
The first Ghostbusters sequel to have a tangible gimmick and I'm all here for it. It'll be refreshing to finally see some new ideas at play in a Ghostbusters movie.
This looks pretty fun~ NGL I wanna see it in theaters~
Avengers-level of Ghostbustin'? Why not!
It will be nice to see a new villain.  Pretty excited about this. The only nostalgia I want is the theme song.
Bring slimmer back and the staff puff marshmallow man!
I hadn't even heard a rumors of this. I was so scared that this was a spoof trailer or something, especially because the first half of the trailer had no familiar actors in it. But then I saw the kids and was juiced. This is what trailers need to be. All I need to know is: Ghostbusters, original plot, old cast cameos, and that's it. I don't want to know anything else before I go see this.
When the Wild Hunt hears Ciri is in New York City
Hell yeah
Just got ..  GOT.. VIBES.
Eh
Don't be like The Last Jedi and be a 'subversion of expectations" type sequel
HOLY HELL HOUND, you mean there's another Ghostbusters sequel coming out??? 🤩🤩🤩
Paul Rudd is gonna carry this movie, just you wait and see  edit: by the way i phrased that it sounds like i think the movie is gonna be bad, to clarify i mean that Paul Rudd's energy in this trailer feels like a ghost buster character him as a ghost buster just... it feels right you know? his performance was already amazing in the last movie but i can't wait to see it again here, this look awesome
Can’t wait for this to come out. Who you gonna call? 😮 Ghost Busters! 😊
OMFG❤
This is amazing, waiting Frozen Empire movie 😊
Why Patton Oswalt...
So cool and awesome. I wonder what new ghostly nemesis that the old Ghostbusters and Egon`s grandkids and Daughter and that summer school teacher will face.
Please have Rick Moranis
Thank God, I was worried it was gonna be woke garbage
Covid stopped working... bring back climate change!!!
Pedo Patton in it?  No thank you
I want Ecto 1A.
No Rick Moranis but we get Patton Oswald …? Eh .
Ghostbusters meet Frozen
A breath of fresh air brought by Ghostbusters
Please also give us extreme ghosbusters team cameo.
Oh yeah they are back.
Coming to a theater near you in 2029...
I’m in!
Afterlife was more of a good bye, tribute to both Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman. This is going to be original. Looks awesome. They also are bringing back the original Ghostbusters again. Looking forward to this.
Still excited to see the original Ghostbusters as part of this!
Looks interesting
Man, I wish I was paid to shill for garbage. You guys must be loaded.
This is nice, BUT is there any writer able to create ANYTHING new?
I hate everything and everyone. I especially hate people who live off of nostalgia and people who push nostalgia. Ghostbusters was a massive part of my childhood along with TMNT. It was unique and innovative. I had a good childhood. Where are the children of today's unique and innovative art/entertainment? It's nonexistent. All we have now is millennial nostalgia. Yuck,
Where is Podcast???
I hope they don't ruin Afterlife with this movie. Sometimes, studios just don't know when to stop.
I can't do it.  There are no purple hair'd trans women or enough ethnically diverse birth givers for me.   When is Hollywood going to represent the oppressed in this country.
What’s that song in the beginning I forgot and it’s giving me anxiety to know what it was again !! Please lmk
Paul Rudd's reaction at the end is mine exactly.
I'm really happy about the direction they are going with this . Can't wait to watch it.
Looks mid 😮‍💨 We've seen this type of film a MILLION times. When you've seen one, you've seen em all. 🚶🏽‍♀️
Hopefully this isn't about the global warming ghost 😂 of Al Gore past 😅🤣 Original cast is back so who can complain !
So excited! As a Ghostbusters fan, I think this looks great.
NIIIIIIICE!!!! NEW ORIGINAL CONTENT THAT MOVES THE STORY FORWARD!!!???? F******K YEA!!!!!!  IT SEEMS LIKE YEARS SINCE I SAW A TRAILER THAT GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS AGAIN!
Please don't be woke
This looks like it could be something special! I can’t wait to see the Ghostbusters take on Elsa!
MORE of The REAL Ghostbusters this time.
i got chills....
ghostbusters MEETS Day after tomorrow - neat!!
Thank God it's after afterlife
Who ya gonna call!!!
Ghostbusters: The Day After Tomorrow.
1:10 1:29 is that Oscar venkman
ugh another one...let the franchise sleep in peace already, gonna get milked for every dollar huh? this looks so generic. Patton Oswalt seriously??
This is a complete rip off of a complete rip off. It’s the exact same premise of the 2014 film ‘Ghosthunters: On icy trails’. Seriously, look it up! A ghost who freezes everything and will start a new Ice age. Young and old ghost hunters need to join together to stop it…sound familiar at all????  They must be getting revenge at the creators stealing their idea of ghost hunters with a slimy green ghost to begin with 😂
This kind of makes me think of the day after tomorrow but other then that everything feels perfect for what we have seen so far. Looks like Ghostbusters is at least getting things right when it comes to the original characters and new characters. Either way I think I’ll be seeing this in cinema.
ugh does paul rudner need to be in everything?  looks meh
What this song's name
Remy the Rat was in it!
I LUVS ME SOME ERNIE HUDSON AND PAUL RUDD...COUNT ME IN!
Holy crap! They're taking what was set up from afterlife and some of the ideas made for Ghostbusters III (from the rumors I've heard/read about) and merging them into one! This looks amazing!
Yes, this is somethind diferent, this is what I was waiting for.
what...? why? but...why? the last female Ghostbusters was so incredibly terrible... why would you do that!!!!
No. I don't like that it was in the style of a superhero trailer. Hopefully, that doesn't reflect what the movie is like. I want a character focus and business story.
Afterlife was a good movie that focused on nostalgia to bring fans trust back after GB 2016, now GB Frozen Empire is something that fans have been craving for years; something new for the franchise!!!!
The movie looks very intriguing, they could've done a better job with the trailer though....
Oh I’m so ready! LFG!
Who you gonna call!?
YEEEEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHH
Was on board and set to watch in theaters until I saw Patton Oswalt. Other than that looks interesting I'll catch it on the red box
crueeeeeel summmmmmerr 🥵🥶🥵🥶🥵
Looks better than any of the Jurassic World sequels…
Not a fan of Oswald but, all in all, I’m stoked.
I loved Afterlife and this one seems to keep that going so, I am in!!
Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire had me taking gulpfuls of air. The moment you breathe in, you breathe out. Like living, except you’re not connected to an oxygen tank.
Weird coincidence. I just saw Afterlife a few weeks ago and was browsing Ghostbusters 2 clips this morning. And now there’s a sequel to Afterlife? Freak yeah!!!
Just realized the ferris wheel is a 🚫 symbol
Dang this just hits the heart
Afterlife was an effective "Passing of the torch".. now that the torch is passed properly and respectfully, the series can move on to more original stories and ideas. :D  I still find it weird that kids are running around with proton packs, but at least there are some adults watching them this time around. lol
Paul Rudd = AKA the next Jabba the Hutt 1:52 LOL
Please don't suck.
Looks awesome!!!
Looking foreword to it. Afterlife was great and hope the time between the movies was the “ghostbusters 101” time, then the new movie. The red suits remind me of the Extreme Ghostbusters but time will tell.
This looks so incedibly dumb but I'm weirdly into it, so what the hell I'm in 🤙
Did they put a chick in it and make her gay though?
Who wanted this?
I can't believe they're going to bust Mariah Carey!
So glad when he took the movie ISP BACK. 1st Afterlife now THIS? HELL YEAH!
It gives me the chills.. get it?  I'll see myself out lol 😅
Thank goodness it's not the woke fem busters again.
Loved the afterlife and can't wait for this to come out. Great saga. Might plan on going to the theater to watch it.
the original characters just get me so nostalgic...amazing.
Isn‘t there somebody we could call who can grab that awkwardly elongated long-dead franchise and put it away for good into some containment unit? 🤨  There’s certainly nothing wrong with celebrating nostalgia to a certain extent - but for some reason, people just don’t care what they’re actually being served, as long as it has a familiar trademark stamp on it.  Not meaning to be a buzzkill here - hey, I even admit that I was initially excited myself when I saw there was a new movie coming - but after that brief moment, my sense of reality returned and I realized it wasn’t 1984 again, but 2023.
This is thenonly trailer we need. Omg this looks amazing!
Ghostbusters vs Elsa and Anna- sounds epic 😅
looks good
SO HYPED FOR THIS!!!
Glad it ends with Paul Rudd not taking anything seriously.
hard pass
I didn't even watch the first one.
So this movie is taking place in the summer, experiencing winter, comes out in spring, and the trailer during the fall.  Movie of the year, literally!
Winter is coming!!!! I don’t know Heard that somewhere before😝
New bad guy... hot damn!!
Afterlife was boring except for the ending which pulled at the heartstrings of nostalgia. Don't have high expectations for this.
That looks absolute crap, i`ll defo be passing.
looks gay and lame
Yo!!! Been awhile since i was excited for a move!
Bobby Drake: why you lookin at me?!
They could have saved a lot of money by setting the movie during Christmas
Peter Venkman is BAAAAACK!!!!❤
I can already tell this is gonna be a great movie, I have full faith that this new villain will be as great as the last ones.
Nice!
This looks like a disaster movie , in a good way.😂 Finally something new.
No thanks. Just more CGI nonsense.
So didn't expect for another new sequel wow. These movies never fail. so want to watch it. And you got the ant man on the team now. even better.
The only thing wrong with this is Patton Oswalt...
Love it! I'm not a bot too
Yes! Yes! Everything is Yes!
Please, please tell me that Ecto-1 has an afterburner that shoots flames out the back. I miss the Batmobile of my childhood, and that would be a stunning homage.
1:53 that was my reaction to this trailer 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
was hoping they would drop the kids this time. still looks decent!
Can anyone tell me the name of the song, please, that's being played in the beginning of this trailer thanks in advance
Gotta say that this looks amazing
Missed Christmas opening.
Never in all the years since the original would I have asked for a sequel with kids in it.  I don’t understand why they did that.
I'm glad to see a new villain but I think Vigo was a very interesting villain who deserves to return in the future in some way
Oh how original, another movie about an ice age in New York  Haven’t seen this same plot before in over 50 other movies 😏
This looks awesome 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻✌🏻👋🏻😎😁
I heard the piano that’s all I need to know this is gonna be epic
WHO YOU GONNA CALL?
Back in NYC I see.
I’m so glad Sony learned their lesson from the disaster of Fembusters, and totally redirected the IP to something that fans and newcomers actually want to see.
I thought tge afyerlife is the last but NO this is awesome
Some more woke Hollywood trash, no thanks.
Acaster. 1:28
This looks... good. Could it be? Can it really be a new movie of a nostalgic property that doesn't have a woke re-education agenda? This looks like it's just a fun Ghostbusters movie and not some 2hr lecture about how awful straight white men are while they bait and switch the legacy characters with new "diverse" replacements that outdo and berate the legacy characters the whole time.  lol or maybe not, maybe it will be one long drawn out metaphor for climate change or some bs. But the trailer is promising, I will actually watch this.
Please PLEASE be good and NOT woke!!!
This looks actually pretty cool!
I am not a machine. And if I were human, and I totally am, I would say, "AH AH AH AH, GOOD TIMES, PAUL RUDD, NEED MORE GHOSTBUSTERS!"  Definitely gonna be a good time, and once more, not an A.I. leaving comments, for sure :D
Winter is coming
Wonderful!
Paul Rudd and Bill Murray in a film together is one of the best choices they could've made.
I have the same reaction on this like Paul Rudd at the end :D i am in!!
not a single person was hit with the spikes lol what a bad ghosty boy
I loved the original in the 80s hope this lives up to that
I thought we had global warming 😂
I CLAPPED, I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW!!!
😍🤗
Who's going call
It looks crap just like afterlife was. They will never match the first 2 films.
Yes I'll be having this please, twice in the cinema and on 4k disc, thank you 👍
If they can keep the vibe from the 3rd one(no the all female reboot doesn't count), then I'm here for it.
Well people can't complain about ghost busters II anymore
YOOOO
Looks awesome and I'm happy it's returning to New York! I just visited the fire station there last month so it's cool to see it in a trailer so soon.
Nope.
The Night King has arrived to Westero… oops I mean, New York?
So great that this doesn’t look like just a reboot which is more or less what Afterlife was. I hope the original 3 and Paul Rudd are in it a little more, too. Seems promising.
What did you THIS time, Ray?! :P
Lich King or Death?
This better not be woke or else I'm skipping it.
Good news having the cast from the first one back! Bodes well for it...
OH MY GOSH IM SOOOO HYPED UP FOR THIS 😍😍let’s Goooo and the original cast is in to yayyy….Egon would be so proud
I wish Hollywood could just let a good thing rest.
I called it for afterlife... they did exactly what I said they should...  Made the comment on that wack 1 with the chick's AND THEY DID IT! and it was AWESOME! Can't wait for this 1...
Wow that looks awesome can't wait to see it
Why is there a mom as Ghostbuster? She doesn’t strike me as a scientist that has an interest in the paranormal. Does that mean we all get to be Ghostbuster now? It’s no longer a specialist job ? This is awesome we all now get to be ghost busters without qualifying it. This is gonna be a great movie and I get to buy my grandma a proton pack and make her an official ghost buster then me an her are gonna take down some ghosts. Thank you Hollywood for make everything accessible to all us ordinary folks and taking away the mystery magic and COOLness out of the movies  🙏
I hope they don't make Egon's granddaughter a vessel for woke speeches. Other than that, I'm hyped to see what this new sequel will bring. With Aykroyd, Hudson and Murray, it can't go wrong. Bring back Annie and Sigourney please!
YES! THE OGS ARE BACK BABY!!!
Bananarama opening definitely a good start 👍🏼
This looks so different than I expected. I'm excited for it!
Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze “inspiration”
part 4 looks awesome
DUDE this is sounds super awesome! I hope that it is as good as the other ones because it would be a shame if it was bad. But Afterlife surprised me, so I expect it to be bonkers.
1:52 It's ELSA !!!!
WIN!
Bustin makes me feel good
Please stop!!!
Should have called it Ghostbusters: The Day After Tomorrow
Love this! So happy to see they continued beyond Afterlife! Can’t wait!
What is this abomination? Ghostbusters directed by Roland Emmerich?
Ok. I’m in. Original cast is still involved. Keep them, then the franchise will work
Ghostbusters: The Revenge of Elsa
Didn’t even know about this and it looks pretty solid. Rare to get excited about movies these days.
Wow So Cool 🤩
I can’t wait😊
You have my sword. This pleases Orcus to no end
0:41 Oh, look. Just what this needed, a women in a thong running away with her booty cheeks showing. 😆 Ghostbusters: The Day After Tomorrow  2
I guess someone had to do hohoho.
I hope it'll be less of a "MEMBER DISS???" fest Afterlife was, and aims to be a good horror-comedy like the original.
Give it to me. Pump this into my veins.
Nope
I was all in… until I saw Oswald face and then I was all “nope.”
Loved Afterlife, now pumped up for more and this is a different ghoul. Looks really dark and creepy. Love Ghostbusters. Glad this is a franchise they did not ruin and did correctly……
Pils bury dough boy
🎟🍿🥤
🎶 Let it go....let it go....🎶
I loved Afterlife. I thought it was a great way to hand the series off to the next generation of Ghostbusters.  Outside of Patton Oswalt, this looks like it could be really good.  BTW: For one, Oswalt’s just not funny. But, in addition, his public profile through Social Media reveals a pretty miserable person with a lot of hate running through his veins. He’s got some serious issues.
Damn. Had no idea we were even getting a new Ghostbusters!  This looks awesome.
I'll be laughing if one of them starts singing "Let it go."
This certainly came out of nowhere, but I'm glad afterlife is getting a sequel, and an entirely original story that doesn't rely on nostalgia.
I'm a freeking psychic, I only said yesterday that another ghostbusters was bound to come out.
The original cast is in it.  Cool.  The all female one fell flat.  Didn't know they were making another.
Here comes ELSA
Someone needs to make an edit we’re Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Mr Freeze show up at the end, and is like “What killed the dinosaurs…the Ice age!”
This is awesome as a life long Ghostbusters fan
Looks alright. Tired of Patton Oswalt’s meta “humor” though. “See? I’m a nerd, isn’t this funny?”
I’m liking what I see, ild go see this and I hope it makes alot of money. Just to show Hollywood how to make a movie with no woke bs .
I think they mean Batman: Frozen Empire smh
Honestly exciting, and I'm a cynic!
Me likeee!
Can someone please explain how this movie is not 10 min long as it seems the ice/fog ghost is easily going to kill everyone?
I think them having the movie saying it will be out in Spring is the wrong timing choice for the movie.  Since the events of the movie take place in July, they should honestly have marketed the movie to come out on July 1.  Not only would give the audience a connection to the movie, but, the July 4 take-in would almost certainly have been higher because of it.
Ghostbusters the day after tomorrow
Looks cool ;-)
Should’ve been called, “Ghostbusters: A Cold Day in Hell” or “Ghostbusters: Hell Freezes Over”. Frozen Empire sounds okay but eh
New Ghostbusters film with the Afterlife cast " SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY" ❤❤❤❤
Now this what i like. A combination of the original cast and new.
I've been a ghostbuster fan all of my life, this is gonna be awesome 👍👍
Go ghostbusters. Yeah baby. Awesome
Is that Remi from Ratatouille in the trailer?
What happened to G.B.:Firehouse?
Yaaaaaaas
No…please stop…
I know it's a long shot, but if the big bad ends up being Hob Anagarak that would be amazing.
I want the new jacket!
Cok iyi beeeee.......
I've got chills
Any chance you could digitally replace Patton Oswald with literally anyone else?
So female ghostbusters is over now?
Looks like it has potential
Ok I will finally go to the theater to see this. I really liked Afterlife , especially the ending.
Another horse being flogged to death until no one gives a damn about the horse anymore.
Get the packs, it’s Bustin time!!
Please don't let it be cringe woke, like the first remake.
GB fans all be buying those red artctic Superdry jackets and slammin GB patches on them!!
YESSSSSSS! This looks awesome!
yesss!!!!
Is this a comedy? Any jokes?
This too, I’ll pass. Freaking ghostbusters and this is what we get… good grief….
cold   storage   luigi     mansion   room
It’s too bad Harold Ramis isn’t around to film this movie with bill, Dan and Ernie.
.................take my money.....NOW....NOW!!!!!
Paul Rudd is wearing a frikken proton pack!!!!!!! 🤘🏻😁🤘🏻
Already excited. It's rare nowadays for Hollywood to do anything right, but that looks like they've managed to not fk it up.
Nice how they used the grandchildren to semi reboot the series
"Who left the fridge open?"
That’s a dementor - they need chocolate 🍫
Well at least this movie will at least be better than ghostbusters 2016
Here we go, milking it some more to squeeze a few more bucks out of people. Just let it die already.
I love Paul Rudd.
C'mon guys, Patton Oswald didn't kill his wife.
The Last film was so good, a definitive end to the Ghostbusters and a beautiful tribute to Harold Allen (Egon). Then why? Why make another film? Do they want to suck every last drop of creativity out of the screenwriters? As far as I know, no one asked for another film.
I’m calling it now. krampus is the new villain
Its like this movie came outta no where cuz i have not been hearing about a sequel at all! Im wondering if part of the reason is because of the strike? Because actors still cant promote their upcoming projects right?
For the honor of Harold Ramis.
Will the fire department have the Starbucks in it?
Venkman in a buster suit and Pauls Rudds laugh at the end i'm all in
I'm so glad to see an original villain because I feared they'd just bring back Vigo. This looks so epic! 😁
GHOSTBUSTERS 4!!! LETS F***ING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow Ernie Hudson hasnt aged a bit since the first Ghostbusters movie 30 years ago. He must be doing something right.
うわああああああああああああああああめちゃくちゃ楽しみだあああああああああああああああああああああ🥶❄️🥶👻👻👻
Look Melissa, Erin, Kate and Leslie this is what you call original writing!
That’s awesome
It's fine if they do callbacks even if they talk to the old cast as ghost as long as they keep a original direction to the story
Directors ran out of ideas these days that they need to go back to the classics. I hope this move isnt infected with any woke BS.
This looks like it has the same tone as the OG film.     Scary/Funny/serious/goofy (minus the BJ scene i hope)    And all 3 living OG Ghostbusters looking like more than Cameos but Supporting Cast??!!  I'm so down for this!!!
Afterlife was frickin amazing, I can't wait to see what they do with this one!
That wasn't kate mckinnon was it???
hope this is a passing of the torch movie, I love the OGs but if they plan to keep going (which come on, its hollywood of course they are) I dont want them to have to drag Bill, dan and ernie on screen for 7 movies. Nice to see cameos but I know especially bill is tired of it
Let’s gooooooo!
This looks so awesome !!!
I just got chills watching this
I'm sure this will sell alot of product.
YAHOOOoooo i love Ghostbusters
This is it, this is definately it!!!!!!!  Yo Marvel/Lucasfilm.. this is how its done ya morons!!!!! 👻🚫
What if... (Alternate versions of this) Justice League/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire   Mighty Morphin Power Rangers/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Ghostbusters/Men in Black: Frozen Empire   Transformers/Ghostbusters/Men in Black: Frozen Empire
Interesting and cool trailer and vid. I feel bad for the people stuck on the Ferris Wheel watching everyone run away on the ground and I feel bad for everyone else that got froze to death.
Got cold chills and reacted the same as Paul Rudd. Been a Ghostbuster since the 80s. Bring it on.
Soooooo excited!!!!!!!
No woke garbage and we are good
The Original Movie is now Free With Ads on YouTube
OK. How much of the movie is gonna be original and how much references and catch phrases? Don’t tell me! Chilly makes a cameo!
This is awesome
omg enough ghostbusters
Vigo enters the chat
I have refused to watch any new movies at all, but I'm going to watch this.
I don’t know about the title. Doesn’t feel like it has a Ghostbuster flavor. Afterlife was a great title it works. This one? Frozen Empire? Sounds like it could be a Korean flick.
No way another Ghostbusters film it looks insane!
Reminded me a lot of The Day After Tomorrow
Finally not a all female cast. its now watchable
I know Donkey Kong could handle this but the Ghostbusters will do ;)
please, Vigo, the Scourge of Carpathia, make them do a good movie.... please.....
hmmmmmmm
thanks god its not the womans ghost buster
Ok, so this looks really good and I'm happy to see the original cast members returning...but what happened to the characters from Afterlife?  It seems like such a big waste to build all those characters up in Afterlife only for them not to be included here.  What gives?
I got this as an AD and something told me to keep watching, dude I literally started SCREAMING when I saw ecto-1, such a pleasant surprise trailer
Still would love to see a Sam Hain in a movie
Yay!!! More McKenna Grace as Phoebe!
This looks great
Ohhhh hell yeah!!!! Love the creepy ghost at the end, the old GBs, the new uniforms, the fact that it looks like an original story, Ray narrating, everything!
What would have been supper cool is if Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones had also reprised their roles making it one epic Ghostbusters movie 😃 Would love to see Holtzmann back on scene 😁
Hype train
I bet NY freezes and in the end it will unfreeze.
Looks fun, but “Exclusively in theaters” just means I’ll wait a week or two for it to come out on one of my streaming services. No rush. You’d think at least the Ghostbusters franchise would know to let theaters rest undisturbed in their graves. 😜
Now that's something strange in the neighborhood.
SICK!
It's was great then,  now the make of the remake shxte
Diverse much?
This looks really exciting so far ngl.
Patton Oswald and Kumail Nanjiani make me apprehensive about it, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.
Oh huh wonder if this is gonna introduce fae type specters into the setting like they thought about doing with ghostbusters 2 originally
I uh, ye I uh, I still don’t care
I can't wait for this. I may have been wrong, but what's been shown... LETS GOOOOOO!!!
yay new ghots buster
i can't tell if this looks stupid.  is this stupid? Like, this feels like an idea when we're running out of ideas, not when we're rebooting a franchise. This feels like it's a side story episode of a Ghostbuster's cartoon. This feels like "Episode 8" of a 10 episode mini series where the Ghostbusters crew fight a ice-themed villain, but it's filler to a larger overarching story. I swear I was about to watch the trailer for a low-budget video game licensed by a random indy developer. I'm pretty sure Donkey Kong Country did this idea already.
An original ghost??!! I’m excited. Theaters are going to be packed for this !
No matter the genre, the epic music is just a must. And of course Hollywood has to shove the old characters down our throaths all day long. Because they can't make anything memorable anymore.
I have a feeling winston is gonna go out saving the new ghostbusters i hope im wrong thoe
I'm 44 years old so I grew up watching the original Ghostbusters films (thankfully I haven't seen the woke reboot rubbish!) but then I started seeing clips of Ghostbusters Afterlife on YouTube and I have watched Afterlife several times now and it's such a brilliant film like the original two. I agree with what everyone else has said but as big a fan of the original Ghostbusters films it was McKenna Grace who got me to watch Afterlife I saw her in the clips and thought "who's that? She is brilliant!" Phoebe/Pheebs is my favourite character but it was brilliant to see the Old Guys back, they're always brilliant and I loved all of the humour!!! Can't wait to see the new film and literally counting the days!!! "Who ya gonna call 📞?"
Jesus....it's wors then bad...ya goofy m8te from Australia
Now this is cool.. pun intended.
It's great to see that the old crew is still here
Would love to have seen an interpretation of the sandman cartoon episode where the team were fighting everyone’s bad dreams!
I’m really thrilled to see the boys back in this one too. Trying to hold back years of joy here. That entity looked evil as hell.
Wouldn’t it be so cool if this was the film that Rick moralis made a comeback
Ghostbusters meets the day after tomorrow 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hopefully they learned their lesson and don't add any modern-feminist woke BS.
Oh freaking yes!!!!!!!!
I'm still kind of disappointed there was no mention of Vigo in Ghostbusters afterlife
So excited! The trailer and idea of an ice ghost just gives pure real ghostbusters cartoon vibes and I'm here for it.
Wendigo i bet
Frozen Empire, I love ICE VILLAINS!!!
Thank goodness they didn't ruin it by putting Women as the star actors.
Excited to see this trailer for "Ghostbusters V: After Life II: Frozen Empire". That will NOT be a mouthful at the box office.
How does Sony get Spider-Man movies so wrong but get this so right?
Donk Egon Country: Tropical Freeze looks lit.
CHILLS CHILLS CHILLS CHILLS CHILLS AND CHILLS AGAIN... AND AGAIN!!!!!!! OMG! CANNOT WAIT TILL NEXT SPRING!!!!!!!
Bring back Sigourney Weaver!
I have my doubts.  I liked afterlife.  It felt like a really good way to not only make up for the abortion of guuurlbusters, it felt like a really satisfying end to the franchise.  This seems like another cash grab.
Hope the Ghostbusters are in Ghostbusters this time
So at the end of the trailer looks like there is gonna be a final battle. But i hear alot of people say vigo may be in here. Im thinking that the ghost creature at 1:28 is the ghost at 1:50. Cuz they both got horns.
Am i the only one who wants to see a live action samhain at some point?
All in for this... ALL IN! 🤩
Yesssssssss!!!!
1:53 THATS ME LAUGHING BRINGING BACK THE OG GHOSTBUSTERS BACK  :)
Holy day after tomorrow Batman! Seriously where are we going to the cartoon Crossover with them. But this is a great trailer
I cannot wait.
I want you to put a chick in this, and make her gay!
Patton Oswalt and Kumail Nanjiani literally made me so hyped!
I thought Afterlife was okay, I definitely didn't like it as much as most people but I liked it. That said, I think I'm gonna like this one more.
To see so many actors and stand-up comedians I know about being in this movie is epic!
We were wishing for a Ghostbusters after 2 decades. Now it's turning into a pump and dump.
🤣
👻👻👻👻👻!!
Yo I'm loven those red jackets with the logo on the arm just take my money
This looks freaking epic
It's no way they gonna win this battle 😮😮😮
I guess I'm the villain in this one. I bet you didnt see that coming. 🤣🤣❄️❄️👑👑
That laugh at the end is exactly my reaction.
Finally an original villain! Looks fun 😊 Totally skipped the last two Ghostbusters movies. I might actually go see this one 😊
Ghostbusters  (1984) Ghostbusters II  (1989) Ghostbusters III: Afterlife  (2021) Ghostbusters IV: Frozen Empire  (2024)  (might be the final installment)
Oh my goodness!!!
Loved Afterlife and not just for the nostalgia was really surprised by all the new characters came together really well look forward to this!
Yes! Paul Rudd in a proton pack!
It will always bring me joy to see people playing with these toys.
WHOA!! THIS WOULD BE DEFINITELY AN EPIC MOVIE!! CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS!!
Maaaan, I gotta catch up on the Ghostbusters movies. I only seen the OGs. And I honestly wish I could have the 2 hours back from the Melissa McCarthy one. Nothing against Melissa at all, she’s a funny actress. It just wasn’t enjoyable to me.
Y’all are pick mes this looks meh
This is such a amazing surprise, i need to see this. I also wanna buy the new vr game heard alot of great things about it
i love the ice leading up to the station great cast too
When i saw this video I thought it was gonna be a video game or something….. I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT.
I'm sold as long as you give the same magic that Jason Reitman gave us with Afterlife life than you have something hell potentially trilogy
But,but,but,but where's Melissa McCarthy?
THIS IS GONNA BE SOO COOL!      Literally!
I love that they used old and new in afterlife and showing how the kids are following in their footsteps in a more organic passing of the torch. Newer fans may not have enjoyed afterlife as much as say my 44 yr old self, but seeing a proper passing of the torch gave me hope this is a successful franchise doing it right. Star wars and many others just take the old and tosses the history that made it a social phenomenon for cheap money grabs. Plus they got people who care for story in the movie.
Oh my God it looks SO GOOD! The hot mom suited up too! And the whole crew returned!!!
Sold
Wow, awesome🙂👍🏻👍🏻😳🤯💯.
This looks like it was written by an AI.
They have a history even though it never happened before?  Still 🆒 though.
anybody else get giddy over the piano callback?!?
Jurassic Ectoplasm: Return to the Ice Empire of the Planet of the Ghostbusters II
Someone should tell that ghost to just Let It Go.
Im stoked to see mostly positive reactions to this! Im so excited
Yes!!!! To see trevor using a proton pack is amazing!!!!!!
dont fudge up.
Will we see Elsa? :)
AND THEY BRING BACK THE OG BACK THANK YOU :)
old news  80s  rule !   we  need  new  stuff  not  remakes
So after all these years of begging Bill Murray to come back, they’ve got him for not only one film, but two?
This almost looks like a trailer for a sequel to the 2004 movie *The Day After Tomorrow*   The instant freezing special effects look very similar.  Cameo appearance from the Ghostbusters
Yeah!!!, the new generation taking form…. Can wait !!!
I'll wait for the release to have an opinion. Hollywood doesn't have a very good track record these last few years.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE    :)
Ghostbusters: The Day After Tomorrow 😂
Egon's Grandchildren return.
This looks great!
This looks dope
The name scared me a little, but all is great in the big apple.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Garbage next
Looks great fingers crossed and ret peter and Winston has all best make it through even if only in it 10 mins again.. and Lucky best make it to.. ps could someone se d Disney the blueprint in how olto step over a disaster and respect the source asking fot star wars
Omfg I'm ready THANKS FOR SAVING GB FROM THAT TRASH OF 2016
Did not see that plot line coming about the everything frozen coming. Totally surprised
do we really need this? no..
Looks like a perfect start for Columbia Pictures 100th Anniversary.   Hopefully more Sony movies will likely join Columbia centennial, also for next year, Happy early 40th Anniversary to Ghostbusters. 🥶❄️❄️
This could get interesting.
Time to get lectured instead of getting entertained.
Okay this looks...cool!
Bloated with self importance, thick with member berries and slathered in thunderous sound-fx and unconvincing CGI in lieu of actual drama.  More a Disney park ride than a movie.
Awesome!
When's the release date!?!?!?
Ghostbusters vs Lissandra!
I like the red jackets.
First, Sony lands a MAJOR NINTENDO IP in Legend of Zelda for a feature, then we get THIS.....  Did we do something good in a previous life?
I just so happy about this. As a ghostbusters fan for about 8 years I cannot wait for this to come out. 😁
FINALLY a movie I'm actually looking forward to!
OH MY GOD YES!!!! I'm so excited for this already!
A-ghostly ice age
I love Ghostbusters I'll watch all of them but to say it's original it's like Day After Tomorrow Vibes but with Ghostbusters LOL
Is this new
I heard this was a great script based off original “ghostbusters 3: ManHellTon” instead of heat they going ice. Looks amazing can’t wait 🤘🎥🤘  👻
Not gonna lie the red jackets look awesome !
Frozen Empire? Next!
We're gonna need more Tide, apparently 🫤
1:51  Alright, waiting to see what that thing is up close when the next trailer comes out
At least I didn't hope for something good too long. As soon as I learned it was coming (just now), I understood I wouldn't be interested. Could've been sweet. But looks like crap to me. =(
Jersey, go figure.
Did not see this coming so soon, hopefully it will not tank the franchise.
lol too many bots here praising afterlife
Finally, more Ghostbusters by a team who actually knows what the hell they're doing!
Put a chick in it and make it gay
Shut up and take my money
This looks like it's going to be awesome 🥶💯
Still trying to squeeze the very last remaining heart beats out of this dead horse long live the original 😢
New villain
It's almost like I'm about to see somebody going to Die
Hell yeah! Count me in!
This will get me to go to the theater for sure.
Wouldn't call this a teaser trailer... But looking forward to it. The first half of afterlife was good and then I was kind of annoyed that they repeated the original plot for the last half. So looking forward to the second.... Hoping to see some fpv drone ghost traps from Podcast!
Finally a good looking movie for once
Antman having the time of his life!
The last one was good, I'll see this.
All this happened because the storage is full
LOVIN IT Hell YEAH
french fan, need see movie
BRO THEY'RE ACTUALLY DEAD!?!? 👀
im looking forward to this
Right on time for Christmas 🎉🎉
A surprise, yes, but a welcome one!
Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson?  now my heart is beating fast... total hype
Remember when Patton Oswalt gave his wife drugs and she died and everyone just went on as if nothing happened? He's in this movie! So that's cool, I guess.
I’m excited been waiting for a minute🎉
CAN’T WAIT!!!!!!!
Grooberson at the end of this trailer was basically my reaction to all this. Can't wait!
Directed by roland emmerich staring this looks stupid . Is this Ghostbusters or the day after tomorrow after next .
Patton Oswald the guy who is a proud chomo? Sorry, but im out this time. No way i watch this deranged guy in a movie.
Dang, I thought this was gonna be a sequel to the beloved 2016 film.
Hmm, seems like that would be a more fitting name for a GB video game title.  Seems interesting though!
honestly first a rubbish ghostbusters with all females, now a second movie with a bunch of kids again, honestly thanks for ruining the franchise, here's a idea how about a new team that took over the old team but are adults like we had with the original movies
Don't know how I feel about this afterlife ended perfectly with Egon crossing over but this does look pretty cool will keep a open mind
Why is the little troll that murdered his wife in here?
Yas, I need a Ghostbusters movie a ND I don't care if it is not a revolutionary movie. I need to suspend disbelief
Oh my God I'm literally crying I love this
I give up on Hollywood. This looks so stupid! Why does everything have to involve kids? Use the original Ghostbusters!
Boooooooooooooooo... Just let it die already... Are we going to spend the whole 21st century refusing to grow up from the 20th?? The first one is terribly overrated anyway...
Nerdgasm. Nerdgasm. NERDGASM.
YES!!! After the Afterlife movie, I was hoping for original events and it looks like we'll get it!  Reserving my seat day 1!!  Amazing that this was also the shortest wait between Ghostbusters movies!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
is... is that.. Samhain? Cause if it is, this is officially the coolest sequel ever. He was by far the best contribution to the lore from the cartoon.
1:28 This very brief scene reminds me of the game Scorn for some reason.
Yes. Yes please. Ummm, yes please.
Oh my god We’re in like Real Ghostbusters level of emergency here! I mean A FROZEN WASTELAND OF NYC?!? Ohhh hell yes! 🥶 🥶 🥶
This is going to be awesome!!!!
For a hot second I thought they were about to show the 2016 version. That would not have been good.
Too many SJW actors. Pass
Poor New York...always gets it! Meanwhile in Los Angeles...
Reminds me of the Groke from The Moomins.
Ill just call it Ghostbusters 4.  Looking forward to it
They have finally done the legacy justice.
Oh, YES!!!
Where is the Ghostbusters women team? OH! No one wanted that. Nevermind.
Ghostbusters fight "climate change"...got it.
My God, that Ecto-1 engine/siren! AAAAAAHHHHHHH!
The director hasn't made a simgle good film so far, so it's safe to say this will be bad too, but hopefully also fun to watch.
Sub-Zero is the Villain?
santa claus is the ghost?    lemme guess.. he hates global warming
The new villain has some resemblance to Idulnas, which is an existing Ghostbusters villain
This could be good. This could be very good. Might break my theater-free streak of four years for this.
Busting makes me feel good
Translated by Google: Please, we don't want trendy music, we want music that matches the movie.
I hope they add the main villain to spirits unleashed, and I’m glad they decided to use an original villain.
OH MY GOD IS THIS A NEW MOVIE IVE BEEN A BIG FAN SINCE I WAS 7 OR 6 YEARS OLD
Nah.
Looks amazing! Can't wait!!!!
With The Marvels coming out this weekend, this gives me hope in movies.
Fortnite season 7 for no reason at all:
Looks promising! I'm a big GB fan.
Who are you gonna call??? Ghostbusters!!!!!
YESSSSSS!  I am so up for this.  The gang(s) are back together...
🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
I am excited
😮
Take my money! 💰
The Sequel We ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!
What’s Danesh and Ant Man doing in this movie?
Paul's moment there was my literal reaction 😂
would!
It’s a shame that the team is incomplete without Harold Ramis(Egon)! Still be worth watching though.
It's real, OMFG It's real...finally.😅😂
Looks good, apart from one casting error carried over from the last one.
I skipped this video faster than I can say diversity.
This looks chilling!
dammit this looks good¡
Literal chills
Who left the fridge open?
Awesome 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks pretty good .so glad they didn't do a female cast again that flopped and was terrible
This new ice villain certainly has Night King and Ithaqua vibes.
this trailer gave ME chills
HELL. YEAH.
MY CHILDHOOD FOLKS
Will the ogs be in it for more than 5 minutes this time ? And where is Lewis !!!!
Ouch, this is looking a bit rough. Also, any fan could write 1000 movie names to do with ghostbusters before they reached anything as generic as Frozen empire. That sounds like bad DLC for a video game.
I CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS TRAILER I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE
another money grab
Interesting... definitely going to see this one.
Louis Tully has to make an appearance!!
Aw yeah! I was actually in my Ghostbusters costume watching Afterlife in theaters.
sony needs to get out of the movie game
Nope - it has zoomers in it - it's going to be woke and devoid of any original entertainment.
Not the first time in history NYC froze, it happened in The Day After Tomorrow 😂
Why in god's name is patton oswald in this? Oh god he's terrible.
Well I guess the days of writing original films is over.
Well there something you don’t see every day
Cool but what does this have to do with ghosts and ghost busting?
Sounds like it could have been a plot from one of the cartoon episodes :D I like it!
Looks really good! Back in NY, finally new monsters!, and everyone is back again. What a surprise. Super stoked.
Afterlife was the perfect ghostbuster 3. Can’t wait.
Looks horrible.
Enjoyed Ghostbusters Afterlife!!! This trailer for Ghostbusters Frozen Empire definitely gave me some chills!!! This looks like an epic film with the cast from Afterlife combined with the original cast from Ghostbusters 1 and 2 working together to stop a new villain and threat! March 2024, who you gonna call?
Goddamn Elsa arendelle wasn’t enough she froze New York 😂
I've ALWAYS LOVED the countless ideas when it comes to the Ghosts 👻,  That's why I still watched the 2016 one. Cause of the 👻 ideas 💡
I hope stay puff marshmallow man is in the movie
The Day After Tomorrow but it's supernatural
Feels like something from The Real Ghostbusters.   And I find that interesting.
0:10 isn't that illegal
Winter is coming
I hope the official trailer doesn't give away too much of the movie, I hate when they do that.
I know I don’t speak for everyone but Who asked for this?!
Interesting. They managed to convince Bill Murray to return. Twice.  Though I am glad to see this new generation of Ghostbusters and what they can do. As long as the writing is solid and it's still a horror with occasional comedic elements. Fun cast. Oswald, Rudd, and the OGs. Do it right. Don't just be a money grab.
Yay. Ghostbusters 4! I honestly really love this series and am glad they never made an awful spinoff ruining the story. To be fair the 3 mainline ones slap.
Everyone and i mean everyone is saying they will pass on this movie cause of  Patton Oswalt.
Ghostbusters meets The Day After Tomorrow
I think this is above their paygrade..
I can't wait  this is and looks awesome
EYY a new ghost steps up to the plate!❤  We got a ghost past Gozer, Vigo and The Architect stepping up!! We got a NEW ONE!!!
*Bill "Freaking* Murray!*
It's getting chilly here.....
Can't wait to hear about how I'm sexist for liking this.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
UMMM
Actual goosebumps.....
I don't know how to feel about this....., too many sorry remakes lately.
YESSS
:)
Yeah, I got goosebumps. I love that they’re expanding the ORIGINAL universe and not pretending it never happened.
Too big in scale, we just need ghosts not MCU bs
I think this main villain is some kind of ghost ice king because of the name of movie frozen empire that means they are dealing with a king
You guys have been making such great ghostbuster movies over the past several years I can't wait to see this. Not! 🤮
Okay. You have my interest
No idea why this was made?? First one was absolute trash now this 😂😂
🥶
This is going to be an awesome movie👍
I get the nostalgia with the last movie. I think busting out a new villain that clearly seems to be a huge threat is cool. I still hope for Slimer...LOL  But....
Ghostbusters 4 people let’s go!!!
How us freezing being scared to death? That makes no sense.  They definitely could have come up with a better explanation
This is one Ghostbuster's movie that I want to watch!
No job is too big.
Women and men together, with their strengths and weaknesses, different generations working together, that message is not hard to deliver, it's what is needed now. That's what makes the success of a blockbuster.
Looks like WOKE GARBAGE AGAIN. AFTERLIFE WAS A ONE OFF IT SEEMS.
white death touch. this is the force of nature happening in a paranormal way.
Teenagers should not be fighting ghosts. Too dangerous.
I cannot wait this is going to be so good. Finally an OG!
Yay
Who do you call?
what we really need is a sequel to the female ghostbusters.
Oh boy, another letdown
Meh.
Patton Oswalt murdered his wife.
YESSSSS
Cruel Summer started playing and I thought I'd see Daniel Larusso riding his bike go past 🤣🤣
Day After Tomorrow but with Ghosts? Sign me up!
This looks slick!
I can’t wait to see it. I love the originals and after life I just can’t wait to see this one. It looks awesome.
y siguen jodiendo clasicos
No wonder why it's coming out in December this year rather than around Halloween.
Cool it’s ant man
Literally GIDDY with excitement rn I am FREAKING OUT over this
Fingers crossed its as good as it looks. Thank God the villian isn’t Vigo!
I aint afraid of no ghost
Looks amazing, also like how they are trying something new.
Finally, a new modern ghost enemy.
This looks phenomenal. Afterlife was the fan service, now this is going for originality. Im pumped as all hell.
hoping this is less schmaltzy than Afterlife and more drama+sardonic comedy
What the world needs now is Rick Moranis
I don't care if Bill Murray is in it, it's gonna suck.
I did not expect to to see Bill Murray back.  Great trailer, I'm pumped.
Did ghost busters marry Harry Potter?
Please, don't be 'woke'.
Please be good.....Please
GHOSTBUSTERS IV?!
Didn't they say afterlife would be the last! Im a huge fan of ghostbusters and this would be MY FAVOURITE
I'm confused.. why are the kids in charge?
Looks good, brand new story in the GB universe.
I NEVER THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER!! LESSS GOOOOOOOO
Ice to see you
Yes there all back
Can't wait
See look…someone in Hollywood has an imagination and is creating something new using something old that everyone loved..
it gave me chills just watching the trailer,i can not wait to see this one.
Should be an all female cast
Elsa has gone berserk 😅
This is how you bring Life back to an old Franchise, I loved the first movie and I pray this one will be as good or even better thsn the last one.
I love GB! This looks pretty epic. I hope it doesn't disappoint.
Ghostbusters Lives!!!
Paul Rudd's "Ant Man" laugh at the end tho - LOL!
Yes!  Please be good!
This is literally not a thing. Just stop.
so lissandra froze nyc
They could’ve focused on someone else’s descendants, maybe someone who stayed in New York?
This actually looks good and with some thought put into it and not just nostalgia bait.
Looks like As nodt from bleach at the end whose power was also fear.
Oh my god everybody thank the gods we have today we are getting an afterlife sequel fan service you with me FAN SERVICE YESSSS
HEY PAUL RUDD WHERES IS YOUR ORANGE SLICES
Ah, quite literally stole this plot from Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze on Switch. Have just been playing that with my kids and its basically the same. 😂😂
hohohoho
Paul Rudd is a treasure
Another cash grab from Hollywood. Why can't you guys come up with a movie idea without relying on past franchises?
Looking forward to this another ghost busters awesome and the cast is perfect 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪👻
Oh just felt a chill up my spine
This looks awesome
But we wanted to see the Panderverse women from the 2016 film return!  - Said No One
LOVE IT - Personally I would have gone for "Ghostbusters - Frostbite" as the title....but regardless I am so there on opening night!!!
I never saw the last one but I wanted to, this looks good.
“Freeze to death in the middle of July” - haha, that’s the norm anywhere else
역고드름 현상 인가?
I really  like  it. ❤❤❤❤😅😅😅😅
Wow,this not something I expected. Excited to see how this turns out.
GHOSTBUSTERS VI "Who left the fridge open?"
This looks promising.
COOL concept!!
They are going to beat this horse till its dead...well ok I guess they all ready have.
Sign me up.
Oh my goodness.
I’m so looking forward to seeing the sequel!
Oh man...I am excited! And they got the remaining three back for another round!
👻🚫4️⃣ LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO
Heck Yes 100% I am going to watch this please keep making more I love these movies
I feel like the “for the first time in New York history people froze to death in the middle of July” has to be some kind of reference to that “The Day After Tomorrow” movie, but it’s been years since I watched that one so I’m probably missing things
I love how this new Ghostbusters Afterlife series of movies involves actual death. i.e. Egon and the citizens of New York by the 'Death Chill'
Cool
You know something struck me, if the death chill plays off fears itself, does that mean we're going to see this ghost toy with their victims? Like they mess with them to show fears?  Imagine ray seeing stay puft again-
Fin sucks
So ai writes this crap
Ok. Sony KNOWS!
Im likking this
I would love to know WHERE IN THE WORLD IS SLIMER!?!?!
Wow, we didn't even deed to call this time, and they came just when we needed them. WELCOME THE GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
Looks great! This will get me to the theater!
I love the red suits
Gayyyyy !
That Daniel larusso song is too much 😂😂😂
This is the ghostbusters remake we never got. Love the originality and I'm really hoping they put some refrances to the cartoons and yes, even that god awful remake. I think it's past time the ghostbusters expanded to just the same 4 guys.
First half of this trailer plays just like a mint gum commercial!
Well, more overtime for the crew. But there's a job to do. Let's do it!
Ooooo. Interesting.
climate change propoganda boring.
silence franchise
YES A NEW FRESH VILLAIN LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Ghostbusters:Tropical Freeze  Also, yeah you'd BETTER show some of the old ghostbusters in the trailer if you expect anyone to care 😂😂😂😂
The day after tomorrow... now with more icicles and ghosts.
OMG!!!  Ernie!  Bill!  Dan!  I’m going to see this!!!
I really appreciate that they have a new idea instead of piggybacking off the original movies. Like, an actual sequel.
This is guna be amazing I am a die hard ghostbusters fan n I could not be more excited
Absolutely love Ghostbusters, you wouldn't belive the excitement I had when I stumbled across this I had no idea!
So nice to see actual new sequels and not just remakes of the originals over and over again.
⚡️
EPIC
film grain is nice touch, the teal and orange color grading tho is kinda harsh.
Happy they brought Slimer back.     Oh wait, thats Patton Oswalt.
Film looks like it's going to be great, but "Frozen Empire"? What a dumb name.
Are we looking at a possible comic cross over? Is maybe Batman showing up to fight Mr Freeze at the end? 😅
Afterlife did a great job passing the torch onto new characters. I'm ready to watch a great new story.  This ice storm is what my Dad told me what walking to school was like when he was a school 😂.
Ugh, Paul Rudd. So painful to watch.
Never had much in the way of casualties in a Ghost Busters flick before. Not sure how I feel about having massive fatalities in one.
❤
As long as it doesn't turn into "WOKEBUSTERS".. I'll be alright
I ain’t afraid of no ghost… but I’ll definitely dress warm for this one.  This looks utterly amazing and fantastic, this new villain looks great, and it’s awesome to see Pete, Winston, and Ray in this.  Rev up Ecto-1 and fire up the Proton Packs!!!
Cannot WAIT!
As much as I loved Afterlife, one common criticism that I kinda agree with was that it lacked a lot of the comedy that defined the first two movies. I hoping that'll get fixed this time around. Though its gotta be actually funny, and not that garbage they call jokes in the 2016 movie.
And it's back in NYC. Haven't been excited for a movie in a long time. But here we go.
😭🤧☺️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I got to say I am curious about this new ghost villain and how it is creating this winter storm for the city of New York.
Yep.
God this looks awful, like really bad.  It looks like a bad videogame, but it's a movie?  Pass
I've watched Ghostbusters Afterlife in the cinema with my girlfriend on my 21st birthday. Pretty sure we will see this one too together this spring.
OMG, another Ghostbusters movie. I got a "chill" bones inside of me. Get it?
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG HELL YEAH OOOOOH YEAAAAAH
If only Ghostbusters 3 happened WAY sooner, then the og team would be a big younger in sequels after that. Better late than never, I guess. But can they build new weapons now? It looks like theyre gonna need some new tech.  The ONE, and only thing the 2016 film did right, was bring in new weapons alongside the Proton Packs.
Everybody: the Ghostbusters are back in business!  I can't wait for this film.  :D
The ice man cometh 😳
Is that Subzero’s ghost or smthn?
Are there supposed to be jokes in the movie? Kinda not liking this ultra serious vibe
The music is so terrible. Movie looks the same.
OMG IM SO STOKED FOR THIS!!!
This looks so good! I'm excited.
Pretty cool.  I like this direction.  THIS is how you pivot to a new generation.
When will then be now?
When New York is being frozen by supernatural forces, and the police are frozen to death, who you gonna call?
A new films wooohoooo
An ice ghost very likely a woman by the looks of the silhouette? Makes me think of Yuki-onna.
Yes, please.
Jesus. stop.
lissandra?
Donkey kong County tropical freeze for the Nintendo wii u and switch system
I wonder if any lessons will be learned after this is a massive success in a sea of failures..
Oh goody, another butchering of a once beloved franchise 😑 keep ‘em coming Hollywood.
Those kids on the ferris wheel are dead
Just when you thought it was safe to be done with the franchise!!! A new villain, some classic cameos and the vybe of The Real Ghostbusters cartoons combined with the live action cast!!! I can not wait for this!!!
Ghostbusters: Tropical Freeze now featuring Funky Kong.
How much longer until we get a live version of Extreme Ghostbusters?
This looks awsome
Paul Rudd is going to ruin this with his stupid humor isnt he? The ending part just ruined any suspense.
LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!
Nope
Are we just going to pretend those streets aren't full of homeless tents and fentynl addicts
Looks top stuff! Franchise in good hands 👍
Dumb
Man this looks Stupid! They are just milking every movie that was good once.
I watched Afterlife on opening night, I have build the Lego ECTO-1 and I love Bill Murray can’t wait for this movie it looks epic
Tropical Freeze!
Who you going to call?
Yes. Thank you. I did not see this coming... And i am happy for the trailer. Looks like a continuation... A branching... Not a replacement or a reboot. I love that. You don't destroy what made you love the story.
Man, I really liked Afterlife. Now I'm looking foward to this one too! (Even though it's preposterous to see kids defeating demon ghosts)
Winter is coming
Coolness
Awesome. Can't wait
At first I thought it was going to be a fan made trailer & then everything kicked off.  Can’t wait!
i could fix her
Yoooo....
Patton Oswalt? I just hope it’s not “woke”. I don’t want a bunch of politics shoved down my throat in a Ghostbusters movie.  2016 and all.
I hope we see Vigo The Carpathian return...Cuz we already had Gozer return before and now we need Vigo!
Calling it now, the movie will be trash. This is modern Hollywood we are talking about
hopefully they put in a theme song that ties the story together
Goosebumps-- thank you!!!😊😊😊
Paul Rudds reaction said it Best. Ghostbusters got a squad now. I'm loving it! Suck it 2016!
Ojalá salga un videojuego de las 2 películas de Ghostbusters el legado y Ghostbusters apocalipsis fantasma para nintendo switch 2024 en marzo junto con el estreno en cines
Omg yes
❤
There is no summer, only cool
I like the part when Jake Gyllenhaal has to find penicillin on a frozen Russian boat on 5th Ave. when really bad CGI wolves atta…. Oh, wait wrong movie.
I hope someone actually dies in this one. Just adds more realism to it.
Yeah, cool. Looks like they maybe wrote a script instead of an obvious "Wimmin Can Do This Too!" political tract.
This looks so coollll
Huh, at least this looks like something.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!
Nothing about this says ghosts or ghost busters. What is thus trash
look look look look LOOK !!! we got a black woman in it 🙌 also Patton Oswalt looks amazing 👎🏻 hard pass 😆😆😆
much better
I'm sure a "woke" agenda will totally ruin this franchise.
This looks AWESOME!!!
Yay!
We went from them being all female to them being kids. Why? What is the point of this?
Very very VERY interesting!  A great jump off from the spirit of Afterlife into a whole new direction!
Nice!!! Glad to see a continuation of the last movie.
Oh dear lord!!! This looks soooooo good. I’m so happy to see Patton Oswald in on this. Take my MONEY!!!
Afterlife was awesome. What a way to pass on the torch without any stupid agenda. Can’t wait for this movie. Can’t say that about many movies nowadays 😢
A surprise, but a welcome one
Winter is coming.  I can't wait for the Evil Jack Frost
Maybe. If they can stay away from preaching SJW/political crap at us and just tell a good story, this may finally be "the one".
but why?
Eh! un momento!  FROZEN QUE!  Va a salir la princesa del Hielo?  Numa!
Afterlife was amazing and this looks great too. The old mixed with the new. Done like the first two Creed  movies. Awesome
Wasn't expecting that. Glad to see things back in the city.  I saw Bill Murray, but he's not mentioned in the cast list in the description.
When I pictured ghostbusters coming back. I wanted the ogs to be mentors to the new generation of ghostbusters. And their doing that beautifully.
Jajaja! Yeah! creo que si me va a gustar. Bien!
Oh no the penguin guys from Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze are here.
Ghostbusters getting the Fire & Ice treatment?
ngl on one hand im not impressed, on another, I will 100% watch this just cause Afterlife was sooo damn good, and this has a new enemy
Trailer: "For the first time in New York history people froze to death in July."  Me: Nah, I saw The Day After Tomorrow. Almost 2 decades ago.  And I hate that they added Patton Oswalt to the cast.
I don't say this often, but this looks interesting.
When is the movie coming out ik it says spring but they say very soon
Amazing!  I'm so glad the GB franchise found its way again!  It was almost a wrap with that 2016 piece of s***, and then we got Afterlife, which was great.
My boyfriend and I watched After Life on Halloween. I was telling him how I really wanted a sequel. Perfect timing!!!! Heck yeah!!!!
Ger hype!
Oh no, Elsa has gone to the dark Side!
am I the only one that was hoping the women would return too?
I Think they are going for IDW Ghostbusters: The man in the Mirror. If that is Gozer's third Minion, Idulnas, we are in for a treat! And a lot of nostalgia!
Optimistic. I really enjoyed Afterlife, and looks like this will be  much the same, only better!
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED TO SEE IN GHOSTBUSTERS. THE OLD ONES AND THE NEW ONES WORKING TOGETHERRRRR!
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹 I can't wait...
One grip as an old fan.... why is the song just completely left our or minimalized in all of the new movies.
I love everything about this EXCEPT Patton Oswalt being in it because he's a sellout d-bag.  Still gonna see it and support the rare good movie (hopefully) coming out of Hollywood these days, just had to say that hahaha
As someone who really liked Afterlife, I’m pumped, it looks fun.
OMG that looks soooo goo;D
So thousands of people just got impaled to death by ice and this family friendly movie?
That's an awfully Lissandra silhouette.
Phoebe spengler is coming back!
Well that is one way to deal with Climate Change.
I wasn’t expecting this today, so awesome
The more I look at movies that interest me, the more they suck!
Afterlife wasn't perfect but the characters were great and the respect for rhe franchise was strong. With a fresh plot this could be a blast.
This new Ghostbusters film looks really good. I can't wait for it to come out in cinemas in March 2024 as a big Ghostbusters Fan.
So now she’s actually the new Ghostbusters
rudd is my favorite character they added
YES YES YES GHOSTBUSTERS WELCOME BACK
Paul rudd is so good for this film
Hell yeah if its as good as afterlife was! Love ghostbusters!
Burnt out on Gozer. There are tons of villains from imagination and the awesome cartoon to work with. I'm excited. Please don't put messaging in the film.
Yes. Original cast? I'm in.
It was good until they put the marvel humour in it.
I can't wait to see this!
Nothing about that trailer got me hyped, you literally showed me nothing but a city being frozen over.
YESSSSSSS
Will look for it on VHS.
LETS FCKN GOOOOOOO. I love this so much
I love the originality in this! Seems like it'll be cool! ;)
Stop stop hes already deeaaaddd
ARTHAS IS COMING
Finally some movie to wait.
More kids are you guys serious? At least will be more supportable than the 2016 feminist flop...what a disgrace.
Good trailer! I liked the red Ghostbusters winter coats at the end.
Just call it ghostbusters 4. No need to get cute with the names of all the films these days.
I'm so happy to see Venkman, Rey and Zeddmore back at work in New York! But why did Jason Reitman leave the directorial role?
Whats the song playing at the start
Who ya gunna call.........
I’m hyped I LOVE they have old cast
But...Oscar?
What utter crap.😂😂😂😂
💥💥💥💥The one and only franchise that went woke, apologized to their core audience, regain their trust and became a beautiful stronger brand. After Ghostbusters Afterlife I will fully support this movie.💥💥💥💥💥
Omgeee!
I am all smiles
Niiice frost demons!
I love that the premise and stakes look dangerous. Great that Akroyd, Hudson and Murray are back (even if it’s probably for a few minutes). Buuuuut….I hope they don’t go away from the original concept of the “Laurel and Hardy” ghost catching routine which Akroyd has stated was the inspiration for the original film. You need hilarious comics to balance the horror to have an actual “Ghostbusters” film.
Ah, more children. Having them in Afterlife worked in context, but these adults allowing their kids not just to work but to risk their lives doing it is too much. This kind of thing is only plausible in family film franchises, and if that’s the direction they’ve decided to take Ghostbusters, it’s not for me.
The cloud is from me farting
Nice!!!!!!
Yes finally!!!
Nostalgia mixed with beta males and wahman.
for those unaware: bananarama - cruel summer
2 words.... KING KYROS! Fans of PETER PAN AND THE PIRATES might remember the animated villan from THE COLDEST CUT OF ALL. Great episode that reminded me of our cold cohort in the trailer...😂❤
Looks good
Please don't be woke garbage.....Please.
I hope this is entertaining & not another climate change lecture. looks intresting.
Just hope they don't go the route of the Stay Frosty Snowman or some trashy fanservice like that
oh no no no no no. please god noooooooooo
Why do they NEVER release these movies at the right time anymore? This would have been perfect at Halloween time. Instead they'll probably release it at Christmas or 4th of July or something.
I need more man!!
Please 🙏🏼 forgive. My finger slipped.
Can’t imagine Finn Wolfehard and Patton Oswald working together after that messed up joke that Patton said at a Comic-Con panel. But hey, work is work.
👎🏻  That’s my two-cents; take it or leave it.
This reminds me of climate change
When hell freezes ove......
I’m honestly over patron Oswalt  in things.
Remember when Ghostbusters was a comedy series?
A two minute trailer already better than the All girl Ghostbusters!
When is this going to be out
These creators get Ghostbusters .
Loving those '80s vibes and what looks to be a more original premise. I wonder if Dan Akroyd had a hand in the script because this sounds like something he would write.
Lissandra from League 1:50
Imagine if they also had the ladies from the crappy 2016 reboot making an appearance in a non-crappy way.
Meh
So kids again? This is just Goosebumps now.
I love 😊it,and it's  going to get good,
I love the team up of old and new characters!! So awesome to see the firehouse and of course Ecto-1 ripping the streets. Looking forward to the new villain.
Ghostbusters sequel and GTA 6 announcement on the same day? Count me floored.
Paul Rudd is just happy to be there ahhahaha
So happy to see them back!
Scorcher IV: Global Meltdown  Who left the fridge open?
Hollywood still starved to death for fresh ideas I see.
Shut up and take my money
\m/ yeah
I wonder who the Villiain is.
Great trailer actually!
It's more to ghostbusters: WOKE EMPIRE!
This looks so good!!!!
ONG!!! I’m ready!!!
Yesssssss!!!!!!
Lost me at the SJW Indian. Pass
This is my first time even hearing about this! Am I the only one?
Glad they didn't take too long to put up a sequel. Studios take too damn long sometimes.
Hell yeah!
I knew that chick Elsa would be trouble sooner or later from the first time I watched Frozen. Toast her!
I had no idea this was happening, and now I absolutely NEED it!
Ok, I am intrigued. And excited!! I love ghostbusters!!!
YEAHHHHH! A SEQUEL!!!
dont know about that yet...
They better have Slimer in this one. No Slimer no Ghostbusters
Can't wait for autumn to come around down here in Australia.
Can’t wait for this to DELAY AGAIN all the way to the end of the year lol
LET'S GOOO!
1:53 Paul Rudd is such a national treasure!😄
looks like mariah carey is the villain
Omg
So with this, the cringe McCarthy feminist alternate universe is now dead and null.  This is good news.
Jessie from Minecraft Story Mode!!!!
Patton needs to stretch his legs a little and do some drama or he's going to turn into Yakov Smirnoff.
This looks great
I love Ghostbusters lol. Since the beginning.
The ghost busters where all grown men sure why they decided to cast the new gen as teens.
So it's just Minnesota every February....not scary!
the ecto 1 has lines on it!!!!!
"Who left the fridge open?" -Tugg Speedman
1:38 - UGH.  Well I guess one weak link in the cast is better than the alternative.
*WOW (🤯)!* 👏
Please no gozer or nostalgia!!!! Looks good
Looks like a live-action episode of The Real Ghostbusters, and somehow it works. They may be on to something here ...
This doesn't look much like a Ghostbusters movie... and I'm ALL IN FOR IT! This looks so dang cool and new!!
I'm glad they have a diverse team. Reitman said he liked ATC and this will no doubt annoy the haters back when Feig made his film. That makes me happy.
This is awesome and the same characters from afterlife!!
Holy crap a new ghost? Coooool! Literally
No love for Vigo!
Stranger ghostbuster things 2.  😂
Oh. finally there is the new movie of Ghostbusters!!. I need to see phoebe do some jokes and some cuteness on her. because I like Mckenna Grace a lot
Still no Rick? Come on.
Didn't Patton Oswald kill his wife?
Awful music. Stop spamming orchestral percussion. It SUCKS.
Oh oh they know how to reel me in. Excitement has set in and I cannot wait.  Please keep making them, this cast is awesome such a perfect lot to compliment the original four.
Just no.
This looks sick. Can't wait!
I hope stay puft comes back
Cgi looks bad 👻
Yo!
Amazing 🤩
First Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes now this?! 2024 is going to be one of the best, interesting, and most exciting years to date movie wise! I think this chapter of the legendary ghost hunters is going to be interesting I’ve never thought to see the day a ghost movie would add a blizzard attacking the place where it started it all and ties in their paranormal feeling perfectly tied into the mix it’s giving me The Day After Tomorrow vibes! I really really loved Afterlife and I think I’m going to love this sequel just as much! I absolutely can’t wait to see what unnatural beasts emerge from the chilling and frost biting abyss in this mysterious and eye catching film!
Honestly if the movie doesn't take itself seriously, why should the audiencia? Fire the writers and bring back stakes, and substance.
Winter is coming....
WHO DF IS WATCHING THESE MOVIES
I didn't hate it, but I found the levels of pandering fan asskissing in Afterlife to be almost unbearable (really took me out of the movie). So much "HEY REMEMBER THIS FROM THE 1ST MOVIE?!"   This new title sounds like a 3rd party Nintendo DS game, but it looks like they're at least trying to tell a new interesting story (hopefully). Hopefully it's rad.
I’m really hoping we see slimer in this movie
My Love and respect for everyone that has worked on this, my wife and I had goosebumps and where so excited to see this in the pictures, where both still giggling like kids. This still pays respect to its roots but it also feels fresh and exciting a new original story. Can't wait. Still got goosebumps!
ok, i'm on board...
I love everything about this
Wow.more woke trash.yay!
“So cool!” VERY poor choice of words. Also, did Paul Rudd actually try to laugh like SANTA at end of this vid?  That said, though… *Grab your coats and jackets, and hold onto your dookie… because it’s about to get CHILLINGLY SPOOKY…*
I love it can't wait to see it
Ghostbusters meets The Day after Tomorrow
WOKEBUSTERS:
Are they going to remember it's a comedy this time?
Are people really still wanting ghostbusters at this point?
This looks good! Glad this franchise is in the right hands!
Yesssss..... The world needs this. Bring It On.... 👻👻👻👻👻👻👻
Just dont bring back the other "Ghostbusters" for any reason
The first one will never be beaten
Aaaaaaaaaa
Yes, more Ghostbusters
This is… interesting
2016 movie in the multiverse 😂
Loving the movie. Name sounds a bit stupid tho.
Im so happy its a continuation of the last movie. 😁
Sorry, was that James Acaster?!?!
Oh boy, can't wait for the Frozen crossover fanart to start popping up. XD
Oh goodie. They combined Ghostbusters with the day after tommorow..yay..🙄And people say Hollywood has run out of ideas....
The IMDB cast has everybody, even the lady Ghostbusters.. this just might be epic.
I had no idea a sequel was in the works. This came out of nowhere! Not too long to wait, either.
I'd be interested, but sadly I'll likely pass due to Kumail Nanjiani and Patton Oswalt. I'll wait for Bill Murray's 2 minutes of screentime on youtube.
Ghost Busters 2016 eat your Harts out 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
FINALLY, THE TEASER TRAILER FOR THE FOURTH (I MEAN FIFTH) INSTALLMENT OF THE ORIGINAL GHOSTBUSTERS FILM FRANCHISE IS HERE & PAUL RUDD ALONGSIDE THE OG GHOSTBUSTERS CASTS ARE BACK! 👻❄🎬🎥
Finally...an actual "new" Ghostbusters adventure in New York.
YES!
Patton Oswalt is too perfect for this. Can't wait.
Bots in the comments 😂 they still look like children.
Yikes a Cool Cool Film 🎉❤
this actually seems really intriguing
Must they keep milking these classics. R.I.P originality
POV: Winter in Canada
Yeah I'm up for this, why not! 😁👍
I swear to God, if this has any mention of climate change then this franchise is over for me.
I'd rather see Dana, Oscar, Louie and Janine then Remi the rat and the janitor from community in a ghostbusters movie
Just watched it with my son who has ASD and is non verbal but his  smiling face said a thousand worlds ,made me blub like the end of afterlife
An Original Villain!!! Hopefully there are some ghosts from The Real Ghostbusters cartoon series that makes an appearance! Love the trailer!
1:50-1:58 That's my reaction to this ghost, this guy or girl is awesome looking
I want that new gb jacket!
This looks fantastic!!! Can’t wait!
Something always happens to the black girl 😂
Interesting!!!This looks good 👍.
Whoever said Find a way to keep Paul Rudd needs a raise. That man is comedic gold and I can’t imagine a better got for the franchise going forward. Good Lord that man is so likable.
Wow! Amazing! I am so glad that the writers is getting another original villain. I will absolutely check it out when it hit the theaters. The Ghostbusters are back in town!
I was REALLY getting into this, and then I saw PATTON OSWALD and I had to say NO. I will see this for free maybe but I'm not oing to a theater to see it. And YES I went to Afterlife in the theater.
Awesome !
"For the first time of New York history, people froze to death" Roland Emmerich left the chat
Bill Murray finally getting his death scene?  Seems like a villain that's going to get a "sacrifice themselves to save another from freezing"thing.
GHOSTBUSTERS! LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!!!
I hope this one while keeping a comedic tone can also add some horror into there
Better than the 2016 movie, yikes.
YES YES YES
I heard the minipufts are coming back but I don't see how they fit in this story
meh... idk about this one
This looks good
This have made my day I can't wait to see it opening night I would be taking the day off work if I have too
It’s finally Happening!!! AGAIN!!!!!! 👻
The day after tomorrow meets ghostbusters. Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Make something new and stop ruining classics.
I bet when the next trailer releases, they'll put a chick in it and make her gay.
We need another third person ghostbusters game.
have the packs been updated since the old days? Sorry haven't seen the previous movie. Because it was heavy for grown Men to put them on let alone 115lb teen with no muscle whatsoever.
THIS IS GREAT I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS
God damn it. I hate Patten Oswald with a burning passion of an angry god, but I am going to see this movie. Hopefully Oswald dies in the movie.
ahhhh im so stoked for this!!!!!!! i felt like i just watched afterlife and was cutting onions, i cant believe its been 2 years since it came out already
I didn't even watch the last 2. No Harold Ramis. No GB... WokeBusters ain't it son. They had the chance to make it before, but Bill was being a hardass. The video game was GB3, and the last GB.
Этоновое
Well this looks fun. I'll never forgive those responsible for not making more Ghostbusters sooner, way before 2016, before Egon left us, the tech to make the packs not so heavy was around it could have happened.🤦‍♂️ Oh well, atleast this looks like they're actually trying and being creative. 😄👍
The siren gets me every time
cooool!
Not sure about this, opening seemed fun, but the rest looks pretty generic. Hope I am wrong as so want it to be good.
I now eagerly await
Yes!🎉
Too much laughing and giddiness over people freezing to death and encounters with mass homicidal ghosts in this trailer . I wish they would take it more seriously.
yes yes yes!!!!
I hope I am not proven wrong by the box office, but this is an excellent example of how a good sequel should be made...
Here we go again.    ... Again
Lordy … Lady Ghostbusters was so laughably bad but it still got a sequel? 😒😒😒
Damn…that’s a cold trailer…glad they brought back the firehouse!
Who ya gonna call...?
I was so worried they were going to do Vigo or Gozer again. Now, I'm excited!
Everything in this is great... except Patton Oswalt.
This looks fun! The last one leaned too hard on nostalgia but this looks really fun!
This looks good and i want to see it i'm just worried Kamail and Patton did something to ruin it. they are crazy woke people so hope they are just cameos.
this is so good
0:02 How is the Statue of Liberty back in original position on Liberty Island, after the events of Ghostbusters II when she cracked the glass roof of the Manhattan Museum of Art to get to Vigo the Carpathian, and left on the street?  I'm confused.
Hopefully more GB2 references 😊
Oh this looks good. 👍🙂
Wrath of the Lich King.
Yes!!! This sequel cannot release fast enough. And you even used ace of base’s song. 😊❤
Okay, this came out of nowhere, and I'm so pumped! I was worried that Afterlife was the final movie in the series, and boy am I glad to be wrong! Afterlife was a great movie, and I'm really happy that the series is taking its new direction this way. I'm also excited for the new villain, whoever they may be. The Frozen Empire. That's so badass. Between this and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, I'm pumped for the 2024 movie roster so far.
“What is that?” New York is being invaded by Scotland
Not sure why so many "dislikes"  Last movie was pretty faithful, no reek of wokeness.  Just a good ole fun movie.  First was nostalgia, now we have that this seems more original on top of it.  Looks good.
After life was good, so I bet this one’s gonna be even better
Utter garbage. Take a movie, force diveristy into it, force LGBTP into it, make a girl boss, and then watch as the film bombs. Its a set formula at this point. You freaks in hollywood just never learn.
Yeah!!!!!!!!!🤯🤯🤯
I can’t wait for this!!!! I personally just hope none of the ghostbusters new and old don’t die from the death chill entity I love the idea that the og’s start training the newbies concept
Is it Arthas?
If they do what they did in the last installment with Afterlife and still give us something refreshing I’m on board! Looks like they got a great cast!
Oh hell yeah I can’t wait
I didn't even know this was a thing!
Gonna have a ghost busters movie marathon. 1 and 2 and afterlife.
Looks pretty good.  I know that this got made in a very short time. But they got it all done in the same length of time.  This one is hitting for the 40th anniversary and I can't wait to see it.
Ghostbusters......cauld
Hate to be the one to say it, but...this definitely would've played better as a December release than a March release.
Idk why i thought the original Ghostbusters wouldn't come back for this! Are you surprised Bill is in it?
Yay!
BRING VIGO BACK!!!
this looks SO COOL  pun ennead
I'll be there day 1
I’d like to make a spin-off that takes place in Los Angeles, where the lead is an adult Oscar from Ghostbusters II; assembling a team and creating a west-coast chapter of the famed Ghostbusters.
THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!😎
1:54 Paul Rudd conveys everyones collective reaction to the trailer
So excited for the new GB movie. Definitely watching it. Seems it also has a new enemy which is great 👍😃
This is how you make good movies, you stop pandering and just let your true imagination go wild.
Ghostbusters Tropical Freeze
If this is treated with the same love and respect that they gave to “Afterlife,” then this should be great!
Wendigo?
Did anyone asked for this?
Looks dumb and uninspired, I'm sure everyone will see it...
OMG I had no idea this was even in production!  Can't wait!!
At least Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd looks like a ghosts...
YES!!!! Bring it on!
and this product is 1000x better then a all female cast version.
Nice!  Looks awesome! Loved the last movie.
I got chills just watching this.
Afterlife had a buIIsh¡t plot with too large a leap in disbelief even for its own established rules.  I stopped watching it at one point and just quickly skimmed to the end when I saw they didn't really care enough to workout the story breaking plot holes.  I'm almost certainly not going to watch this one.
Let’s gooooo!
I was literally rewatching Afterlife just last night! Wicked timing!
Patton Oswalt + Ghostbusters = Xtreme Nerdgasm! Fantastic casting!/big thumbs up
Why is this so familar?
This looks good
OMG i cant wait for this one .
I would like to yell this: "PLEASE HAVE AN IMAX 3D VERSION"
i have serious doubts about studios trying to revamp past franchises,  personally i think afterlife saved what mistakes were made & should end there for fear of soulless sequels that inevitably drag the whole thing down.  on the other hand the trailer does look promising & i hope you prove me wrong.
Looks fun...I'm in
Ghostbusters 5 movie is back
Anything but another 2016 💩 is good with me, this looks great
I’m so glad the ghostbusters are back like we are getting more movies
This is awesome tile who makes these tiles
The Spangler family plus Paul Rudd, hell yeah! This is something I can definitely get behind. I've been a fan for 35 years and from the newer videogames to these movies they are staying true to the source material
thank freaking GOD i can finally call this a official ghostbusters 4 movie  and we have a new bad guy . i am finally haybed for this one .
Slimer better show up this time.
The only thing I don't want is to wait
This looks cool; I'm glad that the originals are in it too plus it's an interesting idea.  All of New York being Frozen by a Ghost? Come on thats kinda cool
Looks "Cool" 👻❄️
Yes
It aint GhostBusters unless it's in New York City.
There is no enough thumbs up for this. BRING IT!
One thing about it.. we started off with Ernie, Harold, Bill and Dan and although Harold is gone, we're gonna finish with the remaining 3. I get what they were trying to do with the all female Ghostbusters but this is what we really wanted. I hope Bill and Paul play off eachother, they both improv so well.
I love it!
Afterlife was decent, hope this is too. That female remake years ago sucked massive ballz.
Getting Extreme Ghostbusters vibes as the villain crossing the ocean coming into the mainland then city reminds me of the final battle against the Bermuda Triangle type entity in the last 2 episodes of Extreme Ghostbusters and how both the Original Team’s members and current Extreme team members both worked together to take it down. Definitely excited for this!
Calcified's more like it.
My daughter says “this looks cool”
This looks amazing!
😢 looks like it's going to be dogshit like 2016 dogshit!!
Really they put Patton Oswald in this 🙄
The *REAL* Snow Miser 😅 I'm geeked. Can't wait.
another one?  all those books and screenpays that havent been adapted, but let's do a ghostbusters sequel.  again.  bc nostalgia  REMEMBER GHOSTBUSTERS, YA'LL???  LITERALLY CRYING
This trailer gave me chills! Pun intended...
Very excited, I loved Afterlife and this looks great!
Atrocious.
I think that's Satan himself
Sooo is this Lissandra from League of Legends cameo? Cause judjing by her skillset and appeareance it's definately Lissandra.
I feel this could be the "passing of the torch" to a new generation. It is something many franchises fail to do. They pay respect to the old cast and promote the new ones. It looks like it will be done without being patronizing to the old cast.
They got Bill Murry back.... again...
Let’s goooooo!
Cut Patton Oswald. Love his Stand-up, but he always makes movies bomb
Please let this franchise just stay dead. You've tried 2 times already and you didn't manage to turn out something worthwhile. This franchise has one awesome movie, one really good cartoon show, a lackluster sequel, a somewhat weird but watchable sequel to the cartoon and then a whole lot of fart noises. Just let it rest in peace.
Nope.
Why Patton Oswalt?  Not funny at all androids everything he's in.
Who are you going to call??
I really wish they just left things alone. Afterlife was alright but I could’ve lived without it but now “frozen empire”. 😒
I loved Afterlife, and it was one film I was genuinely excited for in a long, long time and it didn't disappoint. It looks like Frozen Empire is going to be just as fun and exciting. I'm so glad to finally see love, care and attention (most credit to Jason Reitman & team) for putting heart and soul into the universe, characters, lore and the franchise. So refreshing after seeing so many other promising 80's/90's reboots over the years failing and just seeming to be uninspired cash grabs by studios.
Bill murray is doing another am suprised he must be during in this one
Anyone posting a negative comment here, just know we're screaming into the wind.  These new Ghostbusters movies have none of the heart/ soul of the original two.  We wanted a legit sequel, that just didn't happen while Harold Ramis was still alive.  Then we wanted a Ghostbusters team up/ passing of the torch from one group of scientists to another. Instead we got kids à la Stranger Things.  This is what the algorithm is pushing, we are never going to get what we wanted.  I feel with and for you, OG fans. We had what we had when we had it. Now it's been rebooted/ branded and they trotted the corpses of the OG cast out to "legitimize" it.
name of the music on the begging?
Mc turdy fked it up forever
Ok, you got me: where can I buy that red jacket? 🤩
"what is that?"  well thats climate change for ya
Good lord: “ghostbusters, climate warriors…”
Afterlife was surprisingly great! Especially after the 2016 atrocity lmao. Can't wait to see this one. Love the new characters and can definitely see them carrying the franchise without the original cast involved.
Finally a real Ghostbusters,like the first. That other one sucked big time.
Stoked
It's a cool new story, had to do that
Thank you.
Please and thank you.
Spencer from King of queens! He's come really far since that show!
It's Viggo
Is anyone else suprised by this like I haven’t herd anything about a new ghostbusters movie then boom this
going to see it don't care. :)
Now if only they would cross promote this film by letting me stream Extreme Ghostbusters.
So happy to c this but does EVERYONE get to b a ghostbuster now??? I hope Ricky moranis comes back.
Ghostbusters: Rime Of The Frostmaiden
I'm not even that big a ghostbusters fan-I like the ghostbusters movies but wouldn't say I love them-but this looks cool!
This is looks awesome. I love the 80s vibes.
Not bad
YESSSSSSSS
Real talk, I was NOT expecting this.
Ok, I’m hyped.
The black girl on the beach looks good.
Thank you for bringing my childhood back to life.
Dude we're dealing with snow ghosts now?snowsts?!??
THE HYYYYPE!
Get ready for some sweet Leslie's tears!!!
Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze
this looks awesome
So glad to see they are expanding on this universe...
Wokebusters: Diversity
YES!!!!  I JUST SAW AFTERLIFE LAST WEEK ISH AND NOW THIS?????!!!!  IM GONNA LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!😊
I want see i want see 😍
Is this real? There really will be  a new Ghostbusters movie next year? This isn’t some fan made wish. Looks great if it is real. Thanx for posting this.
Nope. The last one was awful, this one looks worse. Oh, look! Patton Oswalt as Patton Oswalt again! No.
Wow. At first I thought this was a trailer for a new game, but I'll be happy to take a new movie.
The beginning makes in look like its just another natural disaster movie. Like it could be a sequel to Day After Tomorrow.
Good! Unexpected! I'm still waiting some Extreme Ghostbusters gadgets or reference! But I'm 100% going to watch this
Yesssssssss!!!!!!
Can this franchise die already?
1:54 It’s Kathleen Kennedy!!!😮
What fresh hell is this?
I was hoping for a sequel to the all woman Ghostbusters. Darn
I'm down!! Just wanted to say though, a couple of casting choices I didn't like. Not the main stars of course. Just a face or two who weren't there in Afterlife
I don't like the woke actors.
Looking good 👍
Looks pretty good. Let's hope it doesn't disappoint. PS - Rick Moranis better show up!
I hope there is a way to undo this ice thing, I'm not sure how i feel about 1000's of innocent people dying in a Ghostbusters movie =T
HOLYSHIT!!!
This better not be a climate change allegory. Other than that this looks like a nice tease. Glad to see the OGs backing the new blood again. This is how you pass the torch.
I'm ready!!
Alright, looks good
I'm hoping the original three have a much bigger part in this one. The new people are fine and all... but it's the original three that I want to watch. Hoping Oscar makes an appearance.
I was honestly not expecting this, but this is a very welcome surprise
Looks like we getting a Life action Elsa 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm in
Saw the last one and was surprised as to how good it was. Really looking forward to this.
fingers crossed on this one
Looks awful
Looks amazing, hopefully not a flop like the last one
Needs a cameo from Tuck Speedman  “Who left the fridge open?”
Feels like a story from the old cartoon. I bet Ray will consult Tobin's Spirit Guide at some point.
Looks garbage .
Revenge of the Pandaverse
Ghostbusters afterlife grabbed my curiosity, Ghostbusters Frozen Empire grabbed my attention.
So Patton Oswalt and Kumail Nanjiani appear here?
Yay! I can't wait for Good Guys vs. Bad Guys part XII: the hidden chapter: Reboot/the beginning:  the awakening.
Maybe...
it was like from the extreme ghost busters
Who you gonna call? 👻
I am glad they focusing on story, villains, and characters; was so tired of woke nonsense.
It’s Samhain back from the icy depths of Halloween’s Past.
More Ghostbusters meets Stranger Things crap! Paul Rudd sucks!
Totally encapsulates 0 of the original spirit... what is this epic nonsense?....
Cool
This trailer is already 1000x better than the 2016 movie. Yeah, I said it.
I AM PUMPED!!! Rudd is so Gudd!!!! Let's Go!!!
Honestly LOOKS scary! Glad to see the old crew back again.....again!❤
So stoked loved the last one
where da feminist ghostbusters at?
Bring it on!
….lady demitresc👀
Climatebusters: Ghost Empire...
Samhain!
Wow i feel something is this excitement?
Great… another Ghostbusters film. 🥱
This Is Awesome, Can’t Wait For The Next Ghostbusters Movie!!
Last one was fantastic and this will be also.
And the O.G.s are back!!!!!❤🔥
Yes finally a new creative villain I like to see you so far 2-4.
OKAY Awesome BUT CAN WE PLEASE GET THE GB THEME IN A TRAILER !
I had the biggest grin throughout this whole trailer
This just dropped out of nowhere. I saw the title earlier but didn't bother clicking as I thought it was another game, and I'm still yet to play the 2009 one (I want to but still haven't gotten round to it). So glad I decided to check it out.
Very polite of these world ending ghosts to always wait their turn and only show up when there's ghostbusters around to stop them. 😅
I’m gonna call the big bad until the new movie comes out called the ice demon ghost king. Man I’m excited for this movie to come out.
This is a very welcome surprise!
Need to add Rookie Brian Welsh the game was cannon love to see him in this.
finaly a teaser that isn't a compilation of clips from previous movies with minimal original shots. and that is why the Ghostbusters franchise is the best
I thought the office was turned into a Starbucks.
Ok. I'm ready!
I thort the new ghostbusters film was going to be called firehouse😮lol
Finally Paul Rudd is a Ghostbuster.
Yes another win for the Ghostbusters keeping that amazing energy from afterlife ❤🎉
Can’t wait!  Didn’t know this was coming!
They’re back!!!😊
He's back! And he has a lanyard!
Man i really cant wiat to see this
This sounds very similar to a 2010 movie called Arctic Blast.
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮👎👎👎
I dig it the beginning sequence gives me Godzilla vibes lol where everyone starts looking out at the ocean 🤘😎🤘 can’t wait to see this in theaters
Great trailer so excited 🔥🔥🔥
This us what I imagined the wild hunt from witcher 3 to be like.
The og theme song is missing in the trailer !!!!!
Damn that got dark real quick.
As someone who didn’t like Afterlife, I’m much more excited for this one.  The previous film felt way too tethered that Force Awakens formula, relying on references to the first film, And just didn’t feel original to me.  But The New York setting, the new aesthetic with the red jumpsuits,  having the original cast back, And a threat that isn’t ripped directly from the original two films, Is an ice step in the right direction.  That said, *Ghostbusters: Mass Iceteria* may have been a better title.
1:50 elsa really let herself go 😂😂😂😂LMAO
Looks great! Would be even more amazing without Patton Oswalt
Patton Oswalt in a Ghostbusters movie?  He must be over the moon for this one.
Naw.  I think they missed it.
Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Day after tomorrow crossover?
Where's Pocast?
Wow so its The Day After Tomorrow but with a demon     LOL
Kumail Nanjiani is an annoying actor. Why he had to be in this....?  ugh  Oh well. Lets see how this film turns out.  AFTERLIFE was alright. Nothing to flip about.
This is great, would love to see this succeed and have even more sequels on the way.
I am absolutely pumped for this!
That looks pretty cool.
Y'all didn't have Slimer in the last one! Y'all need to have Slimer in this one; Frank Welker sound effects and all!
Is this For real!! I love ghostbusters!
Ant man i love him
Not at all what I was expecting for a new Ghostbusters but that makes me SO much more excited!!
Sweet I was hoping to see a continuation!
I cannot wait
And I WILL be seeing this in theatres
Can't get enough of that piano string! 🙄
Got hella Skyrim vibes from that new villain. Super stoked!
Aww look! It's Ghostbusters if it was filmed in Buffalo NY instead of the city!
Oh yes
The Night King has invaded Ghostbusters ?
I have no clue why but this reminds me of the mummy movie that had jet li as the big bad.
Dude !!! Paul Rudd looks like he's having so much fun !!!
I hope slimers back.
It's a shame they waited until after Harold Ramis died to reboot the franchise. 😞
Looks great! The one thing I ask is that the OG's aren't side characters.
I can’t wait for this I’m so glad they got rid of the female “ghost busters” that movie was a shitshow
Paul Rudd is the GOAT.
Yes!
I did not expect this wow
I hope the new villain asks Ray if he is a god. He should know what to answer this time.
This looks better than the previous one (which was fine, yeah), back to NY, baby!
I wish exreme ghosbusters get their movie
🎼Let it gooo 🎼Let it gA-ohhh!                I can't wait to see Elsa fight ghost.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE
Can't wait to see the new villain.
Awesome new cast selection&good to have the cast of the previous movie back too.
Meh, the last was mediocrity at it's finest - Not getting hopes up
What about FireHouse? when it coming to theaters?
Whao I wonder what happened in New York this time?!?
Looks good just hope we get more of original cast this time
I can see Vigo appearing later on…now that would be awesome 🤩🤩🥳
Wonder if Rick Moranis will be back?
I wish so much that is was good... I really do hope.
Yes please!!!!!
Paul Rudds reaction at the end is the same exact thing I'm thinking.
So excited for this!!!!!
Hmmm solid maybe. The first film is my number 1 fave movie ever, love GBII, huge fan of the cartoon, vastly disappointed by Afterlife, this looks like it'll be fun and I love that there's an original villain. But... the visuals are off, it doesn't look cinematic. More like tv, even AI-like in some spots - the first couple seconds are ok, but the whole beach bit looks like a superbowl ad, the rest feels like tv or video game cut scenes. I'd much rather have a tv series than a movie anyway so we'll see.
Can't wait Afterlife was so good
Yes Bill F'ing Murray
Looks mediocre, can't wait to not pay for this and watch it for free on someonelse streaming service.
Yooooooo how did I not hear anything about this? I didn't even know they were making a sequel to 'afterlife'. Most excellent!!! 🤘😜
This looks genuinely great
Oooooo
I saw the poster for this in the movie theater. I KNEW the icon was encased in ice!
Alright Folks Grab Your Overalls, It’s Time To Bust Some Ghosts
Watch its gonna be Jack Frost
Wasn't expecting the Ancient Ice Ghost from Ghosthunters: On Icy Trails to become canon to the Ghostbusters mythos, but here we are.
BOSS BATTLE: Regional Variant Gozer. FROZER (Ice/Ghost)
Someone call Batman!
Dude, I literally just predicted that in the next Ghostbusters the villain will be an ice ghost! And would Freeze New York. And that was way before the poster teaser came out 😱
im shtting my pants over this for real. anyone who said another sequel would be bad must feel so dumb and silly rn
Oh he'll yeah
I LOVE IT! 😀
This is the real thing? Not a fan vid?
At least they've stopped with the fiminist crap
Paul Rudd's character is CLEARLY laughing at the sight of Stay Puft returning, but being on the Ghostbusters' side of the fight.  I bet he chooses a the form of a destructor and does what Ray did 🤣
This looks fun as hell!
I am totally in!!!
They are going to fight Elsa from frozen???
Honestly I'm excited, this is actually a cool idea and I love the idea of the original cast slowly kinda handing off the reigns to the new cast. Pretty epic
Still wish Rick Moranis would be part of this.
Its always new york man xD But i guess in this case its to be expected as the franchise had its roots there.
Are these comments for real???! This looks blah, what’s funny is that most movies that are coming out in the last 10 years are bland and average… this looks like just another attraction spell fo viewers to famous actors. This doesn’t look that great, but then again. Most people are average and will literally never understand what iconic movies were really like…
Finally... they brought in the original crew to train the new crew... that is the proper way to handle sequels.... And Paul Rudd fits within the thematic :D
I liked everything except that gutless cuck Patton Oswald.
I got chills, and I'm not sure why
Loving the mix of old and new in this.  Love it. :)
“Who left the fridge open?” — Tugg Speedman
Oh hell yeah! The new Ghostbusters trailer is finaly out!
After this time I keep thinking on how Bill said he didn’t want to do another of these movie 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I've watched this trailer ten times already and will likely watch it ten more times just today
I was not expecting this trailer to drop!
Really excited for Ghostbusters again! This is like Frozen, only having Elsa staying as the villain!
The quickest way to get me to smile like an idiot is to just play the Ecto 1 siren. I’m so excited for this. The OGs, including Bill Murray, and Patton Oswalt? I am so there.
They're back to save the world!
It doesn’t look as bad as the 2016 “Whamen-busters” movie, but it’s not clicking with me.
Alright, this is such a great continuation of the Franchise! The Afterlife series was a great start, and this looks to be a great sequel! Just don't ever change ECTO1 !!!!! YAY!!
Looks impressive and spooky! Great to see Ernie, Dan and Bill again, and I'm loving the natural look of most of the scenes. Not too much color grading, and the CGI looks top notch. New villain is a smart choice as well!   Getting baddie vibes from Kumail... Maybe he's an assistant to the big bad?
The Wokebusters....
I literally rewatched the first ghostbusters yesterday and then i see god im excited
You just know Venkman is gonna throw an Elsa joke out there at some point 😂
That’s freezing to death out of fear thing is actually kinda creepy
Quite good! But also, why aren't thousands getting pierced? It's pg-13 but at least shadow hint... if this was Final destination, you sneeze wrong and you would be pierced in every direction!
I dont know
This looks like a perfect ghostbusters movie! I AM SO PUMPED!!!!
ECTO-1 with the spin move and burn out!!!! Dope!!!
Hey, they are actually bringing in new ideas and not JUST doing what worked last time! And an interesting idea at that!
Thank you for not deliberately trying to destroy the franchise like Paul Feig tried to in 2016. Looking forward to a good story.
Uhmm...
Brilliant
FIRST THE FNAF MOVIE, THEN THE GHOSTBUSTERS MOVIE
Winter Is Coming
TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!
Looks good
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
Underwhelmed would be my choice of words.  I'm glad Ghostbusters has been rebooted for all the busters out there who have children but as Hollywood always does it, we have an SFX extravaganza which will be more akin to The Real Ghostbusters.  The OG GB was lightning in a jar.
I wish Slimer eas reformed. (Since Slimer was a good guy in The Real Ghostbusters.)
Why would they put a psycho leftist like Oswalt in this movie... I won't see it just because of him.  That was so disappointing to see.  uggg no.
I just humbly ask you … ALONG WITH THE GHOSTBUSTERS ALL TIME FAN COMMUNITY ACROSS YOUTUBE AND THE WORLD TO … PLEASE .. DO NOT KILL ANY OF THE ORIGINAL GHOSTBUSTERS
Nice!!!
Why did they cast Patton
I am so happy that they are a super fan of the Ghostbusters and especially of Egon, even though he is no longer there, the Ghostbusters are his legacy and I am really looking forward to this new movie.
Why do i get the feeling Bill Murray's character might bite the dust in this movie? I got no evidence to prove it, I just recall he wanted to die off at some point b4 and come back as a ghost. Outside of that, This looks like a solid movie and the old and new casts are merged perfectly.
Cool.
winter is coming
I’m not gonna lie, with a name like “Frozen Empire” I was a little worried. But this looks awesome! I mean, whatever it is, it can scare you to death! That’s sick!
To think next year will be the 40th anniversary of the first movie. June 8th, 1984.
OH! Hell Yeah!
Ray describing the supernatural will never not give me chills
I would have been content if they stopped with Afterlife. But this looks really cool... Pun intended.
I have watched this so many times, I've lost count 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think this will be ok but i think even though it doesn't have the woman from the 2016 movie this to me felt like it was going to far away from the original Ghostbusters world again and i think the movie would have been better if Jason Reitman had been more in control of the movie like he was with afterlife. Anyways we will see i guess but this trailer left me worried for the future of Ghostbusters because if this movie doesn't do well i think this will sadly be the end for Ghostbusters because Sony won't green light another one if this fails in movie theaters.🤷‍♂️🚫👻👍✌️
Odd. Not a ghost in sight.  Just ...ice?
Not again! When will this awesome adventure end?!?
is it weird it felt like they where copping ghosthunters on icy trails obviously this looks way better but ... hmmmm
beyond and above pumped for this!!!    The TRUE lineage of the Ghostbusters Franchise lives on!!!
THEY NEED TO CGI EGON AND the original 3 Ghostbusters the entire length of the movie
I...What?
Does the new villain look a lot like Samhain to anyone? I can just imagine what Samhain could do with fear freezing powers.
Looks ridiculous. :(
YAAASSSSS GIVE ME SOME FRESH🙌🏻 Looks fire, or should I say ice 🥶
This actually looks cool!
I am so excited for this film. I love that patton is in this movie. Was hoping for a rick morranis cameo tho.
Coming soon, so Summer?
Alright, this looks pretty awesome!
👍
Looks like absolute schlock
Getting Frost Fright 🧊
I love this trailer!!!
They need to CGI Egon keep the original 3 Ghostbusters the entire length of the movie
You couldn't pay me to watch this garbage.
This movie looks epic
Ecto-1 doing a perfectly executed tire roasting 180 has me grinning from ear to ear. I hope we get more of Ecto, it was underutilized in the originals but they did a great job honoring it in Afterlife.
Let's go!!!!!
I have been fooled before is this a real movie or is it something from a fan guys idea
"Who left the fridge open?" - Tugg Speedman
NO. Just NO.
Awesome 😊
Looks promising!
Okay I'm interested!
I don’t know who Patten Oswald is and why he’s getting hate for being in this so can somebody explain why he’s hated? Much appreciated
Thank you so much for making another GB movie 🥲
I loved it a lot, the emotion consumed me and the fatigue scared me. I look forward to the next one. 😆😆😆😆
will give it a chance
Hope we get a Ralph Macchio cameo😂
...OK
Looks so bad :(
This looks great! Now put Terry Crews in so he can join the Ghostbusters squad!
Woooo! Great cast!!
Slimer better be in this one. That's all I ask for!!
This movie seems so...suddenly. Did anyone know this was coming?
HOLY 💩 THIS…..LOOKS..L…AWESOOOOOME!!!!!! 😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👍
Looking forward to this one!  This feels like it's straight out of the 80s "The Real Ghostbusters" cartoon.
YESSSSS! I can't wait for this to come out! It'll be very cool!
we just going casually ignore how many people on that beach have been impaled?
This one looks promising l
...Is that OSCAR BARRETT at 1:29 ?
0:58 hey! that's *LOKI'S* FLARE!
Alright everyone, chill.
Lets see which joke should I use: 1. Okay who touched the thermostat? 2. Time to heat things up 3. Well New York is a hot spot for the supernatural. Or 4. All of the above.
Now this is a ghostbusters sequel we all have been waiting for🎉🍻
This looks like it’s going to be so much fun!!!!! Got literal goosebumps from this trailer!
I can't wait. Ghostbusters the original movie was epic but this looks like it is going to be greater. It already had me spooked for a moment. I can't wait to see it soon.
Finally a good story with the original cast involve ❤
Why would you ruin a classic movie - should of just kept it to the 80s movies the best ones - we don't need new Ghostbusters.
They use ai to generate backgrounds for this film btw. We need to boycott it now
So pleased to see this and Paul Rudd is so right for this glad the trailer was cryptic with out too much being given away.
How the hell was this kept a secret? I feel like Arsenio Hall slapping people for not telling him how good the cheese is.
Bill Murray came back? i was not expecting that. Good to see though!
Pass.
oh man! :D
Til, Patton Oswald narrated the Goldbergs
back in action
"My son. The day you were born, the very forests of Lordaeron whispered the name, Arthas..."
I had no idea this was in the works.
Egon Spengler would be proud…Really looking forward to this film! 👻👍
Definitely gonna see this movie when it comes out
Sooooooo…THATS what happened to the night king !
Theyre spooked solid

More trash. Movies are utter garbage now.
If it's at least as good as legacy i'm in
There is no Dana, there is only Cool
santa?
Stop with the over-use of CGI. Just...no. Sorry. I did not see one ghost. I saw some kind of back-lit CGI baddie but other than that... it looks like Ghostbusters by way of Marvel. So generic that I cringed.  I. Am. Bored.
Let’s not freeze to death!
Paul Rudd? I'm in
You know Patton Oswalt killed his wife right? Why do you insist on putting him in things?
So far so good
The only thing missing from this was the theme song.  Other than that, perfect,
I hope the characters from Extreme Ghostbusters  are mentioned in this one
This looks cool‼️👻 I enjoyed the Ghostbusters franchise! Seeing the old and new Ghostbusters together is awesome!!
I would give it ten tumbs up if I could !
I hope they leave the woke bs out of this
Paul Rudd. Nuff said 🙌
Been obsessed with Ghostbusters since the original.  This 4th movie looks AMAZING! The women GB movie doesn't count before anyone brings it up😂. Can't wait to see frozen empire
This trailer is already registering on the PKE meter.
Yet not a festive film. Missed. Opportunity. ~ Looks more satisfactory than the last one.  ~  ~
More lameness that misses the point of the original I assume. But sure, fans have so low expectations, just shove out more mediocrity while they're eating it up, rambling about nostalgia, crying and so on. Afterlife was bafflingly bad, one of the biggest disconnects between a movie's quality and it's reception (well, some called it out), it's almost fascinating.
Too many Woke Actors...
Holyshit this looks amazing!!!!
Well, I know what the first film of 2024 I'll be seeing will be!
Ice Ice Baby better be in the goddamn movie somewhere lol
I'll be seeing this in theaters for sure pretzels ,pizza and a slushy please
OMG GOOSEBUMPS AND HEART BEATING FAST RIGHT NOW!!!!! I DID NOT EXPECT THISSSSS!!!! MY CHILDHOOD HEROES ARE BACK AFTER THE AFTERLIFE MOVIEEEEE!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Whenever I see a storm coming I also ask, "What's that?!"
Finally !!! We now have a series ❤️
This is next level awesome. Afterlife and now Frozen Empire are everything I could have hoped for/dreamt for this franchise. Cannot wait!
Harold Ramis necromancy and sappy fan service aside, Afterlife was a solid little flick. This looks promising.
Boring.
Wish we had more adult oriented movie like original but ok. Anything is better than 2016 lol
Oh, dang, this movie looks insane, i might watch this, this looks Awesome!!
Why are these movies not comedies?
Abort this franchise while it's still legal
LETS GO BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!
They had to use the first movie to transition especially after that 2016 flop that shall not be named. but that segway allowed for the new characters to be endeared to the franchise and now with this original story and the cameos this is set to be a killer movie.   I'm excited for a flim for the first time since the announcement of after life (1)
what day is it coming  out
Yeah, okay.
Ooooh i am so ready for this!
The ghost near the end of the trailer looks exactly like the one in my dream Call me crazy but I think I had a vision about this
James Acaster, babeh! 1:28
Why?  Totally unnecessary film
Let me guess….the villain is Elsa!
Love the Ghostbusters!!! :D
Cool
I CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!
Hell yes!!!
Afterlife was the nostalgia hor’derve  we needed, now it’s time for an original meal!
I’m so excited for this new film and glad to see they are back in New York and seeing the original Ghostbusters back with the new team working together and see both Callie and Grooberson in the suits fighting ghosts
I AM SO F***N' READY!!!
Ecto cooler??
Thousands and thousands of ice spears plunged into crowds of people and you’re gonna tell me everyone froze to death? The scariest thing in this movie is gonna be the weather related property damage, god forbid your pipes freeze up.
Wicked.
I applaud it's original story and ideas. We might not have the same humor as the original, but we get to see something new.
Oh man!  Can't wait!
“Looks like we’re going to have to put a little overtime in on this one!”  (I am so excited)
Sweet. Paul Rudd is always a win. Ding!
Elsa is evil
Better not be too scary I'll have nightmares again
Yeah, Patton Oswalt was destined for this franchise.
THIS MOVIE LOOKS INSANE! the lion from the start kinda looks funny because of the cgi and the firehouse is a bit strange because it was made in a studio but the proton streams are brighter than in afterlife just like in the og 1984 film, they have an original movie villian, a new car, and NEW GHOSTBUSTER COATS!!! this looks like it will be a good movie. i cant with the cgi though because you can clearly tell when something is real, and when something is digital. i think this movie is going to be so amazing when it comes out in spring hopefully they dont mess it up. I also love how they changed the proton packs because if you look closely you can see they are a bit different at the cyclotron!
welp, im excited, are you excited ?
🙄
So the bad guy is Santa. Far out!
Now this has got me excited
LET'S GO! CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS. Seriously, this looks amazing.
meh
Brings back memories from the 80's Ghostbusters movies and cartoons.This is going to be a Blockbuster for sure.
This looks like just another forced BS sequel to me.
Coolaboola, i really enjoyed the last movie.
Also i hope this will also get a bunch of new “lore” in terms of the supernatural
Yo thanks for not showing the full movie 😂 i just realized like o that was short and effective
Time for us to gear up next year 2024
I think 1:05 is the most Ecto-1 shot of Ecto-1 I have ever seen, this looks Mega 💥
Kinda funny how much emphasis they put on the ice spikes when freezing/being scared to death is how people are dying. Somehow doubt we're gonna see anyone (except maybe a villain) skewered.
WHO YA GONNA CALL
Awesome! I know Leslie Jones must be in tears
Hate the kids are ghost busters. But this looks perfect as a equal to the first 2 movies... Actually impressed
Vankman is going to die, isn't he? I believe the trailer just foreshadowed it, plus Bill Murray originally wanted that to happen anyway. Either way this looks awesome.
I cannot LOVE this enough!!!
Oh boy..
It's all just so tiresome 😮‍💨
GHOSTBUSTERS!
Is this an episode of goosebumps?
cant wait to not watch it.
"FROZEN EMPIRE" GET IT???  BECAUSE NY IS THE EMPIRE STATE
I was hoping the villain was azetlor from the game
Frozen 3 looks dope
This looks like a goodie! I'm down!
YES PLEASE!!!!!!!
One thing good and one surprise: Good-something new and honestly this feels like an episode of Real Ghostbusters. Surprising-Bill Murry is back? I guess he's really changed his mind about Ghostbusters.
Paul Rudd is finally a New Member.
The Day After Tomorrow with the Ghostbusters I dig it.
WHY is fatton oswald in this?? What did they need a beta cuck character?
love IT
Too much CGI, this one doesn't look great to me...
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!
Take my money now. I'm in.
Am I the only one who didn't care much for Afterlife? Not sure if everyone is just excited for a new GB movie again or what.. But lets be real here.. Being a die hard fan of this Francise.. this looks eh... it looks ok lol. I'm still not a fan that it's becoming a teeny movie.
Who is asking for this? It looks God awful.
Looks promising, let's hope it's not another shtshow...
REGARDLESS OF ANY BAD REVIEWS AND REPS , IF YOU ARE A REAL FAN .YOU WILL WATCH IT 😍  WHOU U GONNA CALL?👍😎
That's the laugh of a man who realizes he's about to bust a ghost.
Looks really cool aside from Patton Cuckwald.
I just want silly paranormal stuff with comedic gags that sometimes lean towards disturbing. Idk if the original movies can be topped,  but heres to hoping for the series to live. Hope the directors love the series as much as the fans do
Day After Tomorrow 2 ?
excited
wat
I ain't afraid of no ghost!
As someone that loves ice and snow, this pleases me.
Umm…why do I hear Loki’s theme song???
I'm sorry but this looks dumb.
TAKE MY FREAKING MONEY!!!!
Outstanding
Niceee
I happy 😂😂😂😂😂 it coming all back
Really glad Afterlife did well enough to get a sequel
Yes. Yes. Yes!! Looking good 😎
So are they going to have vigo again
I’m so excited for this especially the new villain of the movie and can’t wait to hear his name and glad it’s taken place in New York again and Spring a long way ahead but it’ll be worth the wait!!!
God please make it stop.
Yesssssssssss !!!!
So this starts by playing Bananarama's "Cruel Summer". Already I'm interested.
But this time a comedy, right? Right?
Allowing the older generation to hand it off to a new generation that respects the old generation is the best we could ask for.  The new is relying on the old for expertise,  but shows they can handle the action, and will come into their own as experts in time.  Hope to see more of these to build up a new generation of Ghostbusters.
Why can’t we let dead franchises stay dead? Just name it something else. This isn’t a ghostbusters movie. If it was named something differently, I wouldn’t have even known.
Praying for a Rick Moranis cameo!
Stop butchering old franchises, come up with new ones...
Ghostbusters was an original idea and IP and became beloved. Can we please learn the lesson that new ideas are good rather than what we seem to have learned which is people loved this IP?
Looks amazing. Just change the title. Maybe "The Hell of Snow"
gonna be bad
This ia so freaking awesome!!!!!
Its must be Arthas!
More films, really. We did not even need a second ghostbusters now there are five films. They had to pass the legendary roles on to some powerful diverse people. Why does every good movie franchise have to be ruined. The only reason people are going to like this film is because of the original cast and the title.
Something to look forward to in 2024!
So happy that Ghostbusters lives on! 🥲👻
Looks like the cold will be staying longer than usual next spring...
The collective groan from the RLM guys was deafening...
Props to Michigan Ghostbusters for ruining this teaser via their FB page hours before it was officially released to the public.
What it's called: GHOSTBUSTERS: FROZEN EMPIRE  What is should be: GHOSTBUSTERS: The Series that will never die.
Here we go ghostbuster
I was so into this trailer, but then Patton Oswalt
HECK YEAH IM IN
Let's go!!!
Mr Grooberson ❤❤❤
Holy crap they got Murray back!
Oh my gosh I was so wrong about this movies logo. I’m all for this thing!!!!
Is the villain Santa Claws?
This looks awesome!!
Interesting
Hopefully it’s Better than afterlife,
It Appears To Be Surt Using Fenris.
Haven't people in Jersey learned not to get in the water? Jaws anyone? This looks good. I am not a fan of the second movie.
Looks amazing 🥶
My body is ready
No Gozer, no Vigo. Original villain  🤞🏻please don’t suck
Ohh man,i like surprises but i didnt expect this.Let's goooo.
i hope the fan service is over that afterlife relied so heavily on and the corny jokes have gone but great to see a new threat/villain
I absolutely love the look of this movie right up there with Afterlife but bigger stakes!
Is this for real?!!?!😱
I can't wait!!!
Everybody chill. It’s just Mr. Freeze.
So it's goes from 100 degrees to -100
It’s andrealphus?
Will Egon Ghost be there too?
This is just the day after tomorrow again (Kinda..)! AWESOME!
So.....the Night King.  I guess this is what you get with a writer's strike.  They hope we all forgot about Game of Thrones.
I REALLY love the chance of finally having a creative new ghost story after so many years ❤
OMG!!  I was just thinking isn't it about time for a trailer???  This has made my day!!!
Looks good and happy it’s sent  back in city,so hyped for it.
sigourney weaver I saw her in the trailer!
Who ya gonna call?
Yes
Anyone notice Ray saying “Rivers of ice”… kind of like a nod to a river beneath the city in GB2?
Nice to see that James Acaster made the teaser.. but not the cast list in the caption?
I'm excited for this. I really am.
Oh god.. not patton oswalt. Whatever at least we are getting something new.
LET'S GO!!!! I want one of the red winter jackets now!!
BRUHHH WE SAVIN THE DAY WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥
Evil elsa as the villian. Looks good.
Alright, NOW I'll watch Afterlife.
This isn’t a remake, reimagining or reboot but a true continuation of the series. Someone has got it right for the first time in a good long while, finally!
Is that Patton Oswald voice over is he in it?
1:38 patton Oswald?
Where's Oscar???
Well the ghosts can kill now ive never heard of that before

Pass
This looks damn good
Paul Rudd gets it. The fundamental truth: "BUSTIN' MAKES ME FEEL GOOD!"
Oh this looks amazing! I’m going to enjoy seeing this with friends and family, not to mention being at the theater in full gear so folks can have their pictures taken with a ghostbuster!
Finally they got out of the “Ivo Shandor as the villain” shadow that we saw in the game and Afterlife
seems like a plot from the cartoon show
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Im loving the horror elements of the ice ghost
A new generation of Ghostbusters!
YESSSSS!!!!! Looks great!
For the longest time, it seemed like we would never get a Ghostbusters III. After we finally got a Ghostbusters III when "Ghostbusters: Afterlife" came out in 2021, we're getting a Ghostbusters IV less than 3 years later. That's the *shortest* gap between sequels in the franchise's history! 🤓
Elsa attacks
I like the way they did this - a "soft reboot" of the movie series.👍
I wish they would include Scooter (aka "Rookie") in Ghost Busters.
OMG! This looks awesome! I can’t wait 😊
JUST WOW
In some 20 years, it took everything everyone had to drag Bill Murray back into Ghostbusters, and it was for the video game.   Now he's been in the last 3 films. Did he despise Harold Ramis THAT much?
This looks amazing! It feels like the animated series meets the live action. We got the junior Ghostbusters and a brand new villain. Awesome!
Oye too bad they hired patton oswalt for this. He's such a no-talent douche bag.
YES, I WILL SPEND MONEY TO SEE THIS!!!
this looks amazing! my hope is that they do number 3 and they give the boogeyman the proper movie he deserves as a ghostbusters character. that episode in the real ghostbusters was and still is great!
Kind of Makes me think off the day after tomorrow.   Looking forward to this.
This better not have The Day After Tomorrow's 'Run from the freezing temperature' which killed the 'Run from the explosion' trope.
I'm looking forward to this. Not sure what Patton Oswalt did to get into a Ghostbusters movie, but i remember he bashed AVGN for not wanting to see the 2016 Ghostbusters. Now I wonder if AVGN will see this if he's in it 😅 Not sure about the guy from Eternals, he hasn't left much of an impression on me, but will see how he does here.
Looks alright, so far. Here's hoping 🤞 they don't insert any current day politics into the film. 😅   Otherwise, this might be something worth watching. I always liked Ghostbusters. 🤩
Thanks for including Patton Oswalt in the trailer.  That will save me 20 bucks and a couple of hours next spring.
NOW WE'RE TALKING!!
This tune's intro gave me some immediate Bobby Brown's 'Own our own' vibe.
Looks awesome!!!
Ice apocalypse movie?!
They did it again. Im so glad ghsotbusterd found their stride. This looks great
Kinda indifferent about it sense the dust settled on Afterlife I realized, i like the fact the old crew were in that movie than actually caring about the movie itself….so now yea im kinda w/e about it
Pretty cool 😎
Where’s Slimer tho
FINNY BOY
Can we quit shoehorning in Patton Oswalt in every geek film. He's become the equivalent of the Wilhelm scream in actor form.
That’s actually pretty interesting.
This actually looks decent.
The trailer looks good to me just as long as they don't blame it on global warming it will be okay.....lol....😂
1:51 that’s looked like Elsa?
Looks good as much as afterlife
My smile right now is huge😁
My smile right now is huge😁
LET'S GOOOO
This is my favourite Donkey Kong game
McKenna Grace, tasty.
SALAVRGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!
So day after tomorrow but ghost busters?
Omg.......its 1984 all over again.  This is gonna be.... AWESOME!!!!!
Yes mateeeeee
Unbelievable that they can make something so refreshing and original. Cannot wait
I can't wait. They have Peter, Ray, and Winston along with Annie Potts plus the new Ghostbusters (Mckenna, Paul, Carrie &Finn) and also Patton Oswald! I even see that Dickless is in this film! Fingers crossed that this is a great film!  ♥ 👻🤣
Loved the trailer! No Gozor. Something new!
As long as Bill Murray is in it, I'll watch it.   This holds true for any movie.
1:54 LIKE father like daughter She is wearing egons ghost detector goggles
Could this be as good as it looks. We will have to see.
It's less like a movie trailer, and more like new DLC for an old game you forgot you owned.
Neat.
Heck yeah!!
Woohoo! Can't wait to see the new Ghostbusters movie when it comes out!
What's, the Death Chill? Never saw this im the original cartoons? Is this from another GB series?
A theater-only release, huh? Interesting risk. If it pays off, this might be the movie event of the year.
The kids seem to play into the Extreme Ghostbusters where they are the new working with the old. Would be a cool way to work towards that tv show.
Oh, no! New York’s frozen. 😧
There are some actors that when I see them all I see is that actor not their character.  Patton Oswald is one
Disney is not taking notes, I see.
Is Mr Freeze the villain? Batman Ghostbusters crossover? 🧊
Dam this looks amazing! it’s  as if they  just let the nostalgia go out for once and create something unique and different for once!  Very excited to watch this man.
Sony relly out here beating a dead horse cause they cant come up with any original IP anymore. Pretty sad
I am so excited for this! Especially the design of the Ecto-1! A mix of the 84’ and the Afterlife, and even some new designs like the red stripes on the hood that attach to the red fin striping!
Bring on Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire!! That new villain looks really sinister, im so ready for this i want spring to come fast!
Ghostbusters: the cold one
Yess! Finally a new Ghostbusters movie Ghostbusters frozen empire! This is gonna be the best movie ever! 👻🚫❄️❄️😁😁👻🚫❄️
I got chills. Good job!
THEY ARE BACK  WHO YOU GONNA CALL!!!!??
God dammit! Now I have to go see this in the theater!
I couldn't have predicted an ice world Ghostbusters movie in a million years. This looks great! The villain looks like IceDevimon from Digimon
Is this real or fan made?!?!
At least some studios seem to finally get it. Give the fans what they want, and they will be rewarded. Can't wait to see this in the theater!
I need Ghostbusters right now.
Usar trampa si
And having the power to kill anyone it froze looks like the crew are gonna have tough time with this new ghostly threat descended on new york  old new and new generation to gether.
Una rebelde su equipo Barbie si por fantasmas si
The series is still alive!!! 😎👍🤩
so the new baddie is Santy Claus?
I have faith in these sequels. Afterlife was great and now an original villain and expanding the universe will lead to great things.
I have to say when I saw those Ice spears coming off the ground it reminded me of Pokémon the movie 3 and we all know how that went
For the fourth time people, there’s something strange in the neighbourhood. Who ya gonna call?
Who suiting up for this one when it comes out I am
That guys is better here than in Ant Man.
Heck yeah 👍 👍👍
“Frozen Empire” heh poetic forms franchise as stagnant as this one
Imagine if they played the Goosebumps song by Travis Scott
Pass the torch. That's how you do it.
Gives me The Day After Tomorrow vibes. Looks scary, I love it.
As someone who grew up with the animated series, I feel noticed.
Remember when Ghostbusters was funny?  Good times.
I certainly wasn’t expecting this film, this ties in rather nicely with the previous release; can’t wait for it to be released 😅
I litterely got goostbumps watching this. Amazing cinematography and dark tone. Looks amazing forllow up to afterlife, the second best of the series.
Give me ALL that Acaster!!!!
New enemy better than gozer, ivo shandor, and vigo the carpathian a ghost enemy on a another level having the ability to freeze the entire world and make paradise for the paranormal in hiding.
"Exclusively in theaters" ok bro. yohohoho
Looks cool. Kind of surprised to see Bill Murray in the trailer though. I thought it would just be Winston and Ray.
Patton Oswalt my man!
Wish they would just leave ghost busters alone! They have made it dumb.
Patton Oswalt?  Hard Pass.
"GOOD."
PERFECT! As a child, I always loved it whenever a new cartoon episode had a new ghost to hunt down. This one gives the same feeling of excitement for the new enemy. I'm surprised people actually "died" because of whatever evil is going on. The kids look like they're gonna be in serious trouble and would need a different strategy dealing with this!
They seem to have finally figured out what people want to see
Great another movie I won’t get to see because it will get locked behind stars network fees.
There is still time to cut Patton Oswalt out of the movie.   You don't have to waste all of the production costs.  Or you could leave him in and loose every cent you spend, and all of the fan good will earned by afterlife will disappear instantly.
Yes Yes Yes!!!
As long as they keep the 2016 movie cast out of future films it should be great movies to come for the franchise.
I kneew It will come a new movie because of the credits of afterlife
Nope
Looks good. 👻
Who You gonna call?
You know, I'm just gonna say it took him them long enough. To make A third movie. And it was absolutely worth the Wait, but this is on a whole new level. And I can't wait to see what this franchise now has in store. I always thought the Sam Haynes  villain from the cartoon. Would translate into a really awesome movie. I'm not even gonna lie. It looks like they really nailed this.
WHERE IS SILMER
I wonder if that was Idulnas.
Yeees, yes, yes. This looks fantastic the original crew plus the new crew and lots of new faces plus a brand new villian!
It's official ladies and gentleman.... Paul Rudd is a Ghostbuster
a webo
OMG they delivered the sequel. I can't find my pants!!! ^^ Plus first real original story since the 1989 movie and/or the 2009 video game
How is there a sequel from that awful Afterlife movie?
Aside from Patton Oswalt... this looks legit.  And they're using an original villain.  You once again have my attention Mr. Reitman.
Huh. Cautiously optimistic....
Woooooooo
LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!
Are you guys trying to get a write down on the sony pictures taxes?  Why else would some one cast Patton Oswalt?   Putting patton oswalt in a movie is like putting feces in mashed potatoes.   Nobody is going to want either after that is done to it.
THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!!!
Yessssss! Who ya gonna call!!
Meh... Looks like The Day After Tomorrow with ghosts.
Can we just leave it alone..... Please
Eh. Whatever
Yes😊
Bill has really aged.
so I'm guessing they're dealing with a level 7, who has the power to control ice?
I’m diggin it.
Afterlife was a good movie but Sorry I'm not a fan of the New cast members . I like Paul Rudd in the movie . Glad to see the original guy's in the film
Yes!
Excited to see this film!
Mei: It wasn't me I swear! Elsa: Don't look at me! Jack Frost: I'm innocent! Els Shenron: Yeah I wish it was me but it's not. Sub Zero: Look man I was hanging out with Johnny Cage. Ice Man: Logan can vouch for me. Ice Ghost: *Sweats ice cubes.*
Patton Oswalt?  strike one , strike two, and strike three in one fat little body.
I just thought of something... anyone remember the guy who said "Finn Wolfhard, an actor born with the greatest p*rn name"... he was in this trailer. (No hate intended though, I really like him as an actor, Finn as well)
Hell yeah!
if this movie is done right it will make afterlife even better as it was the transitional movie between old and new generations!
Better call Arya!
I’ll take like 8 of these please with different ghost bosses and settings, thanks I’ll leave my money in y’all’s wallet
I wish I had the same luck as everyone running on beach as to not get impaled by 10' ice lances raining from the sky in my every day life and/or playing the lottery! 🤣🤣
A winter ghost striking New York City in the middle of summer? Almost sounds like an episode of The Real Ghostbusters, and if that's the direction they're going for, then sign me up
I don't know why but this one of the few reboot movie series I am liking and this movie also looks promising. good work..! keep it up.
Booo! Patton Oswalt?  Why would someone make a good movie then put the most hateable hack on the internet in it to drive away paying customers?
This is what I wanted to see with Afterlife. The old and new cast working off each other. I'm excited, I was having a bad day but this just made it better. Looking forward to this movie and the cast. I'm hoping there's either a surprise cameo or a nod to Extreme Ghostbusters.
Hope this movie becomes a hit so we can enjoy more sequels of the Ghostbusters
They are REALLY reaching…
Two in the box, ready to go…! This looks awesome, bring on the snow!
Meh, feels like a Marvel Movie. Every serious scene/situation will be abruptly ended with silly humor. I'll pirate it if I'm forced to watch with the fam.
So my question is: Is it a frost giant, a ghost, a demon, or another sorcerer like Vigo. Gah this is awesome!
Wow.  Paul Rudds laugh is a perfect reflection of how excited I am for this movie.
Looks like they read The Dresden Files.
Finally something original.
For this one, we want Ecto Cooler back! It would be even more appropriate. Ecto COOLER.
Interesting
Who you gonna call?
Wait till you see the new Ghostbusters vehicle !!
Lost me at Patton Oswalt
Another zoomer cringe mcu style movie
Hmm, let's see, I've been burned before...
God just leave the past alone man
They're back once again!
Santa Clause or Krampus? 😅
I’m on board!
Really looking forward to this! Great to see Finn in his second Ghostbusters performance ❤❤❤
NOPE
The lich king?
This is so cool I can't wait for this movie and I'm surprised that they actually got the original Firehouse and all the characters from the previous movie Ghostbusters afterlife is going to be in it this is going to be cool
Okay, while I haven't seen "Ghostbusters: Afterlife" yet, this does look like a promising instalment.
Just when I thought you couldn't beat a dead horse anymore. Hollywood loves their sequels to sequels to sequels to sequels to sequels! So much originality Hollywood!
I’m a simple man, I hear Ecto-1’s horn and I’m immediately in
The cast is the real problem.
Yes!
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold…
“Yay! More Ghostbusters!” /enter Patton Oswalt “Oh no.”
What an amazing way to celebrate 40 years of Ghostbusters. (I know it comes out in spring not summer, but I'm counting it.)
Yippee! Finally a sequel with spine chilling villian ❤🎉
Its great to see they were able to resurrect the franchise after 2016. This teaser has me excited for spring. I cant wait to see what they do with the original cast and the new cast. Thank you Sony for giving us the movie sequals we deserve and want.
YES
Cool 😎 Ghostbusters 4
This looks awesome 👌
This franchise won't stop, won't it.😏
Looks 👍
Isnt Day After Tomorrow already did this?
I really liked Afterlife. Hoping the best for this one. Trailer looks good.
Ghostbusters is famous for its theme tune, why are you using this generic music instead?
I’ll pass. I wish studios would stop making reboots. Sometimes it’s cool to go back and finish a story or rewrite the way the creator made it but I’m just done. I’ll wait for it to stream.
Cannot wait!!!
❄☃️ That's really cold.
Can't wait, it looks fantastic!
I'm stoked
Oh no, you are destroying the legacy. And why Paul Rudd of all people?
Nice throw back to 1984 with Cruel Summer
IT'S MILLER TIME!
I Thought I'd see a film like this when *Hell* freezes over...     G 🚫🚫 S  E  B  U  M  P  S ! ! ! ! !
This movie looks pretty COOL
TAKE MY MONEY
Oh i can't wait to see that Movie!
Good thing I ain't a ghostbuster, I saw some sort of Ice threat and immediately went, "WAIT, DOES THAT MEAN THEY GET FLAMETHROWERS ON THE PROTON PACKS!!!"
3rd times the charm huh?
Who left the fridge open...
Pumped
The most amazing thing to me is Bill Murray agreed to come back.
Literally got goosebumps.
E P I C !
I miss the 80s.
Not enough diversity, more gay black women
I don't care how good or bad it could or will be - I'll be there in the theater with my children to see it on the big screen.
This looks actually good. Especially with the Original characters in it.
I'm going to watch it over and over and over Absolutely can't wait...
It's a shame they let Pedo Osswat in on this.
Paul rudd is the perfect actor to carry on the ghostbusters franchise
another feminist sequel - no thank you! woke sh**
Looks like every modern trailer of a classic franchise, compare it side by side with The Rise of Skywalker
I heard Sigourney comes in and says "get away from her you bitch".  Only kidding.
Fellow Ghostbusters out there, looks like we will have some new red jackets to make and obsess over. Let the screenshoting and speculation begin.  See some lights on the front there 🤔
hopefully they don't ruin it again and why is that Oswalt guy in this did he pay to get put into the movie ?  Anytime I see his overacting it just makes everything seem so already stale
This feels like artic blast
I can hear Harold Ramis, screaming from his grave: "NO MORE SHAMELESS CASH GRABS" !!!!!!
Hearing ecto 1 just gives me chills
No pun intended, but this gave me chills. Can't wait to see it. 😁
YES ! YES! YES! OH GOD YESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Atleast it's done in the city again... Still, who knows..
Elsa is that you?
1:51 LONGMAN!
That laugh at the end!
Who you gonna call?!
Was that Fartgor the Frozen?
now this is what we want, a new original villain and new and old cast, worth a trip to the cinema to watch this
Big Silent Hill: Shattered Memories vibes from this one.
This new villain is trying to start a new Ice Age.
YOOOOOOOOO HYPED!!!!!!
Looks like this could be based on Akroyd's original script for Ghostbusters 3, Hellbent!  I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!
someone let a sorceress from Diablo 2 in the movie.....
so cool! I wanna go and see it!
Wasn’t expecting a Ghostbusters and Adventure Time crossover, but I’m glad we get to see what it looked like when Simon put on the crown!
I feel bad for those of you who think this will be good😭
Vigo is looking a bit more chill at the end of the trailer
I'm loving it
no
Damn, i wish Harold Ramis was still around! That would be perfect....
This is literally gonna be so COOL!!!!
If they made slimer an official ghost buster it could be perfect.
Anyone else remember "Silent Hill Shattered Memories"? That killed a franchise too.
IM HYPE IM HYPE
Anyone else think that villanous figure was Samhein???
Ecto-1
their better be ice puns in this
I'm so hard right now
thb this looks great. The summer nyc vibes feels amazing haha
Ecto-1 is back on the streets of New York, where she belongs. 😍🥹
Ghostbuster forever!❤👻
Hope its not just Schwarzenegger playing Mr Freeze again 😂
Please don't be woke, please don't be woke, please don't be woke...........
I might actually go to the theater for the first time since End Game. I'm excited!!
Who ya gonna call *Climate busters*  Plz plz plz make it stop or at least get 4 good actors to remake the first films, and ffs not the old ones making another cameo  *YAWN*  🤣😂🤣 i rate this film for people with an IQ of 60 to love.
What's the name of the song from the beginning of the trailer?
Cringe
Nearly 6000 views but 17,000 likes? 🤔
I don´t know... It looks a bit "too much". Where is the humor and the charme from Afterlife? Just action action and action.
Love it
Yes, please!
Ohhh baby
I had the same reaction as Paul Rudd😲
so i think making him part of rebooting the sereies with new gen is good idea if been upset if one the original wasnt in it 😅
Im geeked seeing the containment unit , looks like another possible breach by the way the walls cracked and shook. Im curious to know walter pecks role in this one.
Where is Sigourney Weaver, we need her back too.
I really like the new team!! two adults, 2 youngs, and OG as their advisors/support
Looks better than the last ghostbusters garbage they put out
Looks super lame, not sorry.
Lets hope it will combined quality and venerance of source material of Afterlife with good oryginal story.
Oh hell yeah!
Haven’t watched any since gb2 I refuse
🚮
Whoooo!!!
Goosebumps.
YAAAASS! Been waiting for this!
Ok I can dig this a original villain new store and chilling deaths coming I wonder who's gonna die
seeing as the last two ghostbusters movies were severly lacking, I am not expecting much from this.. More hollywood capital frozen into a tired franchise
MAJOR KUDOS on being what looks like a completely new idea (even the Title is unexpected), and not a rehashed trope from yesteryears!  I'm soo looking forward to this!
I thought this was gonna be one of those fugazi fan made POS’s……..
It looks ok, am surprised, first movie was a little bit shaky but turned around became kinda good, hopefully Hollywood can keep it up and not stray into absurd agenda, political messaging and wokism.
Boycott this movie!!! Where is the 2016 cast!?!? 🤬🤬🤬
🧐
That sent CHILLS down my spine!  Well done trailer, and we love GHOSTBUSTERS!!!!!
Please please please don't have the original Ghostbusters as only cameos!
Crossed fingers for Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver cameos...
WINTER IS COMING!!!! I fought at Hardhome!!!!!
Reading these comments and man... I do have to wonder how much of this is just bot spam trying to hype up the movie.
THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC. And then, Patton Oswalt appeared.
Mr. Freeze?
beautiful trailer! outstanding production!
Is this a crossover with marvel? why is ANT-MAN in it
I’m definitely going to see this
Welcome, Paul Rudd. It’s finally nice to have you as an official Ghostbuster!
Yis! Less marvel bullshit! More 80s plz!
Can't wait to see it 😁
Wow😃
Elsa is the main boss
So kids are the ghost busters dats a bit jank 😂 looks rubbish 🗑
This is like the plot to Frozen
WHAT?!?..... Put a woman in it and make her GAY!!!!   NOW!!!!
made my day and it's only 4 a.m. here. Im pumped.
Look like the packs got maybe a little bit of a upgrade or the one Paul Rudd or the barrel of it anyways
1:53 😂😂😂 I gotta see this movie.
.....holy crap, it's the GB vs. the White Walkers....
This looks cool (pun not intended) Soo happy to see everyone back!!! 🤩
I’m excited!!!
what da heck!?  I haven't even had a chance to see _Afterlife_ yet!
Who ya gonna call, baby?! 🤩
Lost my interest when I saw Paton Oswalt. Can't stand the guy.👎
Hey, I've seen this before. What was it? The day before yesterday?
I hope this isn't another woke mess. I just want to watch one movie without being preached at.
I didn't see those 2 kids from the last movie in this trailer, or did I blink and miss them?
Bustin' makes me feel good
I’m so excited! Who are we bustin’ this time?
Not those kids again…
Ok now we are on to something
Looks freaking awesome!!! So excited!
Could the bad guy be Sam hain from the cartoon...hands down the best villain in that series
This SHOULD have been put for Christmas!! At least we get to see it eventually. Bloody writers strike.
This actually looks fun
Ghostbusters !!!
Oh nice a trailer for the new season of "Stranger Things". Wait a second....
The cold never bothered them anyway 😅
Can’t wait for this and all the new merchandise on offer, my bank account isn’t going to agree though!
still not sure why they are releasing it in spring instead of summer
Cant wait to never watch this movie and then watch an hour long disection by RLM
Let us not be stingy on the jokes with this one, I didn't see any laughs in the trailer. Love the real ghostbusters though!
Egon!
Please bring back Ecto Cooler Hi-C!
This looks flippin awesome!! I can't wait for the release
Good Ghostbusters needs to take place in New York City. That was part of the charm.
this really given me the CHILLS. (haha)
When did the series become Kidbusters?
Looks better than the last movie.
Dang . I’m so pump for this . I can’t wait to see this
LOVE THIS!!!
This looks promising. They're starting off with a trailer that doesn't give the entire friggin story away. That's a good sign.
@JamesNintendoNerd
I hope theres gonna be a second trailer cos this one doesn't make the film look exciting at all.
Looks like someone "let it go" a little TOO MUCH!!!!
No Ghostbuster 2016 cast? LOL
DK Tropical Freeze memes incoming
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I SO HAPPY GHOST BUSTERS AFTER LIFE WAS THE BEST BUT NOW THIS LOOKS LIKE DND SO ITS GOING TO BE SICK!!!!
If this is as good as Afterlife, we're in for a treat‼
I hope the reviews are better than, meh. It looks like a rehash of ghostbusters 2. This time instead of pink goo making peoples rage becoming real, its fear that freezes them to death, or maybe some people end up running or punching the air?  In order to fight this monster, the gang will get the city to sign up for therapy.
I’m so glad we’re getting a sequel to Afterlife and with an original villain too.  I was fully expecting they’d end up bringing in someone like Samhain the ghost of Halloween for the villain but I’m not complaining.
Oh, goody, another soulless reboot.  I'm sure it'll work this time.  1,000th time's the charm, right?
That looks very promising.....
Ok
Can’t wait to see this
Jäärouva!
At first I thought it was sub zero from mortal kombat 😂 😅
Solid meh.
Thing that makes me so angry that it took them decades to get bill Murray to agree to another gjostbiaters movie and here's he's been in two with out Harrold ramis
Cool idea, General Hospital did it in the 1980’s, Cassadines  were the villains instead of ghosts and demons!
❤awesome
Can't wait to see this
Lo mejor😢 que emoción
Looks lame
coney island, brooklyn making an appearance 🤣
This looks so good
Glad the boys are gonna be more involved rather than being a surprise at the end
There should be a Ghostbusters where Patton Oswalt’s wife comes back from the dead to get revenge on him.
WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
Can they stop with these movies already? Nobody cares for a younger gen version of the original.
Im so happy a out everything but that they also improved the proton stream effects. Afterlife’s effects had me a little iffy since the original concept was for the streams to look cartoony so continuity wise afterlife’s effects bothered me.
deberian darle vida al boogeyman ese personaje si me aterraba de niño
SHUTUP AND TAKE MY MONEY
I’m gonna make a prediction. They’re going to repurpose the mother’s car from Afterlife as the “Ecto-2”. 😂
nope.
This would have been great, if you wouldn't have known, that you're watching a Ghostbuster-trailer.
Let’s hope it doesn’t fail or flop or else who knows what happens next
Paul Rudd's laugh at the end of the trailer cinched it for me. And now it looks like there will be a ghost villain, like in the animated series!? Oh yeah!
Dayum brutal
Why is it the 80s in the intro. Books and cabs and kids playing in the streets...then boom. Cell phones
I'll take it. The actress who played Egon's granddaughter is an amazing actor, and she did a great job playing the role. But the Egon-type character isn't the best role to put as a solo lead (or at least the writing for her character didn't do her justice). That role works better playing off other characters as a co-lead, so I'm glad to see that this may be more of an ensemble. Don't give me hope just to take it away teaser! 🤞 I will say though... a little concerned to see so many folx throwing on proton packs, as well as seeing Podcast back in the movie, if only because I HATE that nickname 😆 And if Moranis doesn't make a cameo, I'm gonna cry
Hell yeah!
LOL. If the ghosts start singing "Let It Go" I'm out.  Actually kind of excited to see this
WHAT?!!!!😮😮😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Get rid of Patton and Kumail!! I am cautiously interested for this movie.
Was that James Acaster?
Those new red jumpsuits look sick
O snap!
"...so cool."  Poor choice of words there Patton Oswalt.
So excited to see this! As huge fan since I was young
best thing to do is reboot the franchise and start over with new cast
Pathetic.
Is this it? Are we finally getting Ghostbusters 3? We’re building on the Afterlife-requel-do-over? God let it be so…
Finally about to watch my first Ghostbusters movie
I love Paul Rudd’s reaction at the end. He says what we’re all saying. Although, I feel like they could’ve come up with a better subtitle.
You can skip this movie in 3…2….1…. SKIP
This looks absolutely awful
The villain is winter?
Didn't Bill Murray once say a long time ago that Ghostbusters 3 would happen when Hell freezes over?  I know this would be 4, but still...
How can u say first time in history,ny frozed,u forgetting day after tomorrow,Ghostbusters stole that!
Good❤
Man, now I need to watch the previous one.
Adding Kumail Nanjiani and Patton Oswalt plus a new villain!!! This looks great.
This looked good until I saw Patton Oswald.
Oh yes!  Bring it on.  Loved Afterlife and been waiting for more.  Also probably totally wrong on this but that last shot made me think of Samhain from the cartoon.
The Ice Spikes look very Call of Duty or Fortnite, I don't mean that in a good way, but I look forward to more ghostbusters content regardless
i LOVE ghostbusters and i am exited for this move but i also wish they would just let the franchise die a happy death and not.. ruin it on accident
Woke
Ok. I'm invested.
Yes more Ghostbusters,
Honestly the beginning looks too much like a typical catastrophe movie.
Last time I went to the cinema was to watch Afterlife, the next time will be to watch this!!!! Feel like a giddy 10 year old once again.
This looks incredible
YES.....YES.......YES......HELL YEAH !!!
Goddammit, I’m intrigued!!😭
The Ghostbusters are back for a 4th time.
I am getting huge The Real Ghostbusters vibes from this trailer and I couldn’t be happier about that.
I'm in!
This is going to be lit
Patton oswalt's voice and face just ruined it for me
I'm just happy B.M. accepted his fate and plays along.
I enjoyed Afterlife but it's still strange seeing kids packed with proton packs capable of blowing up an entire city. It made sense in Afterlife due to the story, but we'll see how this goes.
Looks worse than afterlife. Stupid, corny marvel humor. I hope they don't mess it up
Oh! For goodness sake … GIVE IT UP… we want something original … it isn’t 1985 anymore!
Wow! That looks so good! I can’t wait 😁
This looks wild and kind of scary and i cant wait to see it!
Please don't suck.
Now this is ghostbusters
I was all in until I saw Patton Oswalt
Uggh
❤
Why do they have to have that little creep in the movie???
AHHH IM SO EXCITED!!!
Something strange is happening in the neighborhood
Looks awesome
As long as the 2016 cast does NOT show up, I'm in!
Finally! The teaser trailer to the new Ghostbusters film.  I am so going to see this when it makes the theatrical release.  It's too bad that the original release date was delayed to March 29, 2024.  I was really hoping to see it on December 20, 2023 just before Christmas arrived.  If the original release date hadn't been delayed, the teaser trailer of Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire probably would've been shown during the preview showings of the theatrical release of the 2023 film "Haunted Mansion", that is if Haunted Mansion had been released on October 31 instead of on July 28.
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS! I WATCH THESE MOVIES ALL DAY!
Choo choo! Let's start the hype train!
The new diverse flop
Dan Aykroyd must think he is in a documentary again can’t wait for him to bring out the crystal skulls
So cool... Alright, I said it, so no-one else has to.
Damn, that’s my only word is Damn. I’ve never seen anything so beautiful in my life.
As a wise man once said. "We're Back!"
The name is appropriate because they keep putting this dead body of an IP in and out of the freezer whenever they need it.
I don't understand why the lady crew are not included? Was that a different universe?
Thanks
5k views, 14k likes ... that's what my screen shows🤔???
Looks fun!
Hope its good... feels like youre trying way too hard still.
This actually looks pretty damn cool... get it?.. cool.. as in.. awe forget it.
Groovy 🤘🏻
Looks interesting and defo hyped! Need to see a bit more before I'm fully on board.
Ghostbusters!!! 🍻🍻🍻🍻 Hope this is great!
OMG!! Yes! All together to save the World!🥶❄️🤩
This looks amazing! Patton Oswalt is a fantastic choice to add to the cast. We've got the new characters from Afterlife, and the original guys back in their full gear, cats and dogs living together - MASS HYSTERIA!!!
Darker is better stop pg 13
Just watched the original movie last night
Is that Lissandra from League of Legends?
AMEN! Thank you! 👻🚔🏔 😎
South Park casting inafect
Not sure how I feel about Patton Oswald being in this after all of the shade he threw at the Angry Video Game Nerd on Twitter over the 2016 movie…
Let’s just hope this one isn’t effected by the strike all that much, Hollywood is a mess right now.
That "OH! OH! OH!" Sounds pretty familiar...
I suppose I can get around that spineless hack Oswalt being in this and see it anyway.
Looks promising!
Idk what everyone is so excited for. This franchise literally has 1 entry, the original. Everything else is just riding on itw coattails
I love that we have a new paranormal entity to fight.
Holy name of  ̶G̶o̶d̶  Gozer, this trailer is perfect!
Another ghostbusters movie nice
Growing up watching ghostbusters was cool, raising my daughter watching the old ghostbusters show the new ones how it’s done will be awesome!
Imagine if Elsa and Anna makes a cameo to save the day
Last one was big meh but I'm kinda excited for this one
@Idkwhatever558
where s the f* classic song?
Looks like an original story with an original villain.  Which is a nice change.  Seems pretty violent for a Ghostbusters film.  And they’re ramping up the horror elements here as well.  I wonder if they would actually kill off another one of the OG’s in this film?
So happy to see Pod Cast again!
Film execs: "Which IP can we thoroughly pillage and bleed the most money from? Ah yes, the ghost one, we can still wring some coins out of that one."
Woooow that looks lame
well...this was unexpected
Yesssssss finally lests yooo gooooooooo
This one looks good. Worth the wait.
Damn, I just got chills FROM seeing this!
Looks refreshing. Afterlife was good, but I need to see a villain that isn't just more Gozer.
O, this look good... until.. oh, patton oswalt is in it? Why?? I think i will pass.
Oh boy I am so excited for this! I am gonna keep watching Ghostbusters 1,2 and Afterlife to get myself ready for "FROZEN EMPIRE!"
Wow that is freezing 🥶 Cool that is exciting can’t wait to see this
Where is the Podcast??????
Hey Disney.......TAKE NOTES.....
I luv this idea! Its a passing of the torch to the next generation Of Ghostbusters. And since Afterlife was a huge hit financially and critically it only makes sense this would get a sequel :)
This looks so awesome
I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!
Essa sequência pode estragar tudo ou finalmente trazer algo novo.... Estou hypado pois essa proposta parece diferente.
LETS GOOOO
All right. This looks pretty good.
Let's see if this one can step up from Afterlife
Wow!
Ghostbusters: Tropical Freeze
Busting the chills!!!!
We need a serie!
Not the direction I was expecting them to take things, but sure, let's see how this shakes out
I will be there with my daughters opening night!
memberberry cash grab.
a frozen ghost? Evil Elsa¿?  Paul Rudd is now my fav ghostbuster
BTW, I'm glad to see even the kids' mother also suits up. Hope we get Weaver also suiting up.🫰
LET'S EFFIN GO!!!!!
I feel like no one should be laughing in this movie, or being quippy, that kind of extreme temperature change, resulted in thousands and thousands of dead people, literally in that opening scene. New York would literally be a ghost town.
Yay!!!!
Yes
I’m stunned by the more serious tone of this movie. Anticipating it, but stunned by it.
This legitamately feels like a new chapter for the new Ghostbusters.
This is how you introduce the next generation! Old and young team up
I will give it a chance but that "freezing to death" explanation was about the dumbest thing I have ever heard.
This looks awesome!!!!
Omg I'm so for this
Yeah baby! Brand new villain! Should be chillingly fun!
Guess it's time to be back in business to hunting down ghost or ghosts 👻
oh hell yeah i cant wait when this come out
The comment section looks organic and totally full of real people
I've been waiting all day to this and it did not disappoint
Ive got goose pimples!!!! ❤❤❤❤
This genuinely looks great, can’t wait!
Yes.
Literally had League of Legends Lissandra’s silhouette. Wth
I’m glad they finally got the title of ghostbusters frozen 🥶 empire.
Yaaaaayyyyyy👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 WHO YOU GONNA CALL?!
YEEEEESSS!
I wonder. Why not make the ghostbusters a series? Like 1 to 2 hours long per ghost?
We don’t need yet another sequel. Hollywood is so unoriginal nowadays
I hope this is good
Ghostbusters: Tropical Freeze
Looks pretty damn good!
I’m seeing this.  Edit: Patton Oswalt?! What chu doing here?!
I'm sorry but my generation needs to grow up. Watching a movie about a bunch of CHILDREN suiting uo and saving the day. No thanks how about we go back to the Ghostbusters being 4 grown men...
I cannot wait!
Holy Cow!
Paul Rudd is such a perfect fit for Ghostbusters! Excited to see this...and a new take on the villain!
And the last thing you see... is Patton Oswalt! I can think of no fate greater than death.
Ghostbusters meets The Day After Tomorrow.  I'm in.
I got chills they're multiplying hell yes I cannot wait I love everything Ghostbusters I'm 38 and it's still one of my favorite franchise ever. I love all the Ghostbusters movies and yes 2016  so shot me, the real Ghostbusters cartoon, extreme Ghostbusters and the comics book.
Hear me out. All of these ghostbusters movies being done nowadays aren’t good. Let Quentin Tarantino take it on 😮😅
Will this one also be delayed for several years?
Hey the Ecto-1 looks even better 1:02 1:06 ❤❤😂😂 its cool
❄️👻
so stoked i get to see this in my lifetime...the next chapter.
Ghostbusters!!
Ernie Hudson is back?  I'm in.
i was here early
I  afraid of no olaf frozenbusters I'd love a mr sandman  live action  version of ghostbusters that episode was just so good.  need convincing with this wait for the next trailer.
1:21 The statue lion and the New York Public Library is where the original movie started.
The ghostbusters back again
Afterlife was a sequel we needed to a great send off to Egon and Harold. But this movie is original with a new bad guy. New atmosphere. I can not wait.
A few fatalies in this one, the stakes are higher
GHOSTBUSTERS THEYRE BACK IN TOWN AND THIS TIME, ONE OF THEM IS STILL DEAD  BLESS YOU SONY AND BLESS YOU MONEY WITH MONEY ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE  NOW THERE COLD ITS STILL SUMMER WE NEW GOSTBOSTRZ OW
this is how you do CGI
Yo, this looks dope as hell. Plus, it's cool that they have a crew.
Now this is interesting
I haven't seen Afterlife, but this one does look really cool to watch.
Wonder how many ice jokes this movie is gonna out cool Arnold?🤣  Also - YESSS!
Elza is coming
Fantastic!!!!
👻
so good, so so so good! i cannot wait!!!
Ghostbusters™️ vs Snowmiser™️!  Can’t wait!  👻🚫🥶
Wow that looks Awsome
"Too hot to handle, too cold to hold. They're called the Ghostbusters and they're in control..." -Bobby Brown
This looks so good!  That opening sequence was just like an 80s movie.  Also seeing both the original and the new Ghostbusters was awesome.  I'm even more pumped to see this movie!  Spring can't come soon enough.
YES🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
We're not worthy of Paul Rudd, goddam he's got too much charisma for this world
😮
BILL MURRRAYYY <3 <3 <3
So basically hell froze over and we're actually getting something good. Thank you!
YES! Shut up and take my money!
Please be good, please be good, please be good!  (Yes I did really like Afterlife).
I’m IN. The OG with the NewG with a new villain. Ye$$
Hopefully Rick Moranis has a cameo.
OK...OK... I liked it more than I expected. I hope it's fun. 😊
So the new ghostbusters villain is Mr freeze from batman nice
Ooo! This looks really cool! Enjoyed Afterlife, this seems like a great original villain! Definitely gonna see this in a cinema! 👌 Paul Rudd has continued not to age... 😂
Definitely a new boss in the Ghostbusters franchise.  Hope it reaches Gozer and Vigo popularity.  And Rick Moranis still has not been convinced to come back?
You're welcome everybody. Watch Ghostbusters in est morning
Meh, normal weather for New England, Maine wouldn’t bat an eye…  Movie looks great though!
Let It go, let it go
never seen that many good looking people in coney island lol
This is gonna be good.
I'll take it.
Yawn!
I can appreciate them trying something to get people to the movie theaters. But streaming is here to stay, we are watching the trailer on YouTube, not in a movie theater.
I REALLY WISH THEY WOULD RE DO ON OUR OWN (the bobby brown joint)
Paul Rudd 😂😂😂 I will watch the movie only for him wearing ghostbuster suit ❤❤
Doesn’t look bad
"who ya' gonna call?"  *The nerds!*
I hope we get to see what Oscar is up to these days. He should be on the team
HELL TO THE YEAH!!!!!
Looks great!
great... they get to fight "climate change". Stop making everything woke
SnowGhost
So the original villain is Elsa. Nice, I’ll take it.
Hopefully this also means more toys!
I cant stop screaming!!!
Super pumped!!!!!😮😊❤
Will be wearing my suit and haslab pack to this one!!!
It’s going to get for the Ghostbusters…ice cold.
This trailer is giving me chills (pun not intended)
Yyeeeeessssss!!
Take my money
We’re back in business!
Oh I don’t even care. The last one was so good, I’ll see this one in the theater on credit. Original cast helps a lot!
If this becomes a hit we could possibly get Ghostbusters Hellbent! The original Ghostbusters 3! I’m so hyped for this movie!
Oh my gosh 😁 this looks amazing 🤩
I'M LOVING THIS !!!!!!!!!!
This is the sequel I didn't think could or needed to be made, and am pumped for the original Ghostbusters story to have a new chapter.
I hate when people in movies are not afraid of deadly scary monsters
Ghostbusters are back!!! Now THIS is a movie worthy to watch!!!
Venkman is going to die in this one
Annie Potts plays Janine the desk clerk, I think of her as the 5th original Ghostbuster.  IMDB says Bill Murray will join Ernie Hudson and Dan Akroyd and Annie Potts in the cast of the new film.  All the original OG Ghostbusters except Egon (RIP Harold Ramis)
Whos cutting onions? Love it
So basically you're getting a cross between Ghostbusters and Day After Tomorrow.
YES!!!!!!!🤩
I'm hoping to finally see Sigourney Weaver put on the uniform and proton pack.
Awesome teaser, and I would like to say that this movie should be a dedication to Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman. 👍👏
This...
Please, somebody tell me that was Mitch as the taxi driver.
Looks like they're dealing with a demon this time. Woh.
I'm glad the original Ghostbusters still here. Also a new villain!
Okay, well... this is what you all deserve. More kids with proton packs, more dumb cameos, more ancient original actors, and a trailer that looks like Marvel movie, all because you forced the meme that was Ghostbusters: Afterlife.
Where did the 4 feminist ghostbusters go? Are they in this?
Oh dear God not another one!!!
This is real? This is REAL?! This isn’t some made up fan trailer stitched together from existing movies?!! THIS. IS. FREAKIN’ REAL?!!! 😱😱😱😱😱😱🤯🤯😭😎🤘
Everytime I see the Ecto-1 turning, I get goosebumps!
Gozer building at 0:50?
So, it's the ghost of Frozen
What is the song?
This really snuck under the Radar for me, I enjoyed Afterlife, the only issue I really have is Ghost busting doesn't seem like the right job to have child labor in. Call me crazy, feel like they're breaking some laws there.
After the debacle of the women remaking Ghostbusters we get two more with kids , awful acting only saved by the original cast members, now with an added element of Trans promotion that has no place in a film directed at children.
Yaaay!
Ahhhhhhhhh yeeeeeeessssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :,DDDDDDD
Oh man this looks awesome!!!!!! Can't wait to see this and to see hopefully new ghosts and im so excited to see the upgrade on the equipment. But the question is are we to expect slimer in this movie? would love to see him back
Elsa is Coming!😎
push the global warming agenda trailer.
So it looks like there’s some other ghost busters   Like new ones  Cool cool… I mean it looks like they sue but cool
Надеюсь не обосруться как большинство фильмов
Yes yes yes
It's looking like a home run 🎉
This feels like a summer flick. Nevertheless, Now I have consent to do a film review of this.
If nothing else, I want more cool scenes with Ecto-1
YES!!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
0/10 where podcast lol  20/10
Harold. I'm watching with for u.
The cinematography is way too good
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT!!!
Putz! Que trailer ruim!
Can't wait till a character turns out gay...
ITS KRAMPUS,I KNEW IT!!!!!!
They're laying on the predictive programming real thick these days.
I am so F****** hyped 😍
That looks awful, it looks like they just wanted to create a climate change ghost.
Finally! Some frozen invasion going on! Ghostbusters Codename "Firehouse" is now titled "Frozen Empire"!
Why are these new Ghostbusters movies so serious? This looks awful. Bring back the lady Ghostbusters.
Easily destroy all DC
Very cool! 😂
I remember seeing Afterlife in theaters on Black Friday 2021
why does this exist.  so garbage... GIVE US NEW IPS FFS
Nope.
Let´s hope it will be a huge success
This is going to be amazing! I cannot wait to see it! I hope my Ecto will be done by the time this releases!
Antman?
Frozen ideas
Ghostbusters vs the Night King!! Move over Jon Snow, you know nothing!
Oh, I can't wait for this.
Who you gonna call?
Tropical Freeze definitely wasn't the direction I was expecting this franchise to take. I'll definitely have to check it out.
Wow, they're actually making a sequel to Afterlife?
YESSSSSSS! Every ghostbusters fan in the world is ready for this!!
Seeing my childhood ghostbusters (minus Egon, RIP) has tears in my eyes. They did fans proud in the last movie and this one looks epic. I love the kids they brought in to take over the reigns too 👻🚫🤍
Egon's Legacy will Rise.
So we are just going to act like the woman group doesn't exist must really suck if your a fan of that group
Bring on march  😮❤🚫
THE JOY I GOT WHEN BILL MURRY CAME ON SCREAN!
YYYEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!!
“Let it gooooo let it gooooo.” sorry i couldn’t help singing that
yessssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! okay im done fanboying out
They’re BAAAAAAACCCCKKK!!! Hell YES!
This better come out during Christmas next year
To Me It Sounded Like A Title To A Video Game At First. And I Haven't Seen Ghostbusters: Afterlife Yet.
It's a very strange "stranger things", but I like it!
All was good…until it wasn’t
I....I have no words. A movie I actually wanna see, that looks like it does justice. An original concept while staying with the material....i could cry its beautiful. Suck it Disney
This spring, the iceman cometh!
Nice
can't wait!!
i can't stand any of those kids from stranger things.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
wait why does this look kinda fire
Damn this might be a more morebid Ghostbusters movie
Epic
Soooooo looking forward to it! 😀👍
Who/what is new villian? A old one?
The boys are back!❤
So the New Ghostbusters and the Old Ghostbusters + Scott Lang/Paul Rudd, are gonna fight a Frozen ghost who freezes people in fear?  I know everyone’s excited… but let’s *chill.*
Dude this dropped out of nowhere!!!
Putting on the Ghost Busters uniform when this comes out!
I really hope this movie confirms the existence of Ghostbusters the video game, it’s the closest thing we’ll get to an actual Ghostbusters lll.
I ain't afraid of no cold!
Elsa is not letting go!
Seems like a weird premise. Hope it's good 😢
Oh HELL yeah, they're going with the Afterlife canon!  Bring it home, folks!
The last ghost looks like something straight out of John Carpenter's The Fog.
Oh, Bill Murray is here, that's awesome 😁.
I had no idea I needed to see Paul Rudd in a ghostbuster uniform
Im excited to see Peter, Winston and Ray back. As a huge GHOSTBUSTERS fan im really hoping this movie is as fun and good as AFTERLIFE was. The first part of the trailer on the beach looked kinda like a commercial for a cold refreshing soda coming to cool the people off during the summer to me. And the plot from the trailer (from what i could gather) seems like a plot from The Real Ghostbusters cartoon.   Im still hoping to find out in this movie why GHOSTBUSTERS II  wasn't mentioned in AFTERLIFE even though Jason Reitman said it was still canon. Like why wasn't the ECTO-1 not still the ECTO-1A, why didnt we see any GHOSTBUSTERS II jumpsuits in Egons locker, why was there no mention of what happened at the art museum.......... I need answers.
Jaws much…
Rudds laugh just sums up how i feel watching this
Leave my childhood alone, stop making sequels. 😢
Ehhh......Not quite.
Why yes I do want a new ghost busters? How did you know!?
At least its not a rehash of Ghostbusters 2.
what is roland emerich directing this?
WAHOO
So glad we got past that abomination in 2016.
I think as a ghostbusters fan biggest thing we’ve wanted is originality so I appreciate this including the old characters but going in a new direction. We need to let go of the originals and continue forward with new ideas and villains this looks interesting!!
So glad McKenna is back
Entertainment for the generations!
For the first time, hell has frozen over. And it’s up to the Ghostbusters to unfreeze it. 👻🚫 For Ivan and Harold.
Yesssss cant wait for this, it looks awesome as well 👌❤
Omg omg!!! My absolute favorite series and this is awesome!!! Gozer was cool but we coming back with something else scary?! What?! Yasss! I’ll watch it a million times!
Yessssss!!!!!!!!!
The new team, the new age.
Sweet!
Oooooohohohoh YES!
My childhood has returned 😢
Oh yes!!!
That looks hella good. And the new big bad looks like a wendigo to me
WHAT AN AWESOME MORNING SURPRISE!!! I didn't know this was a thing and it's brand new villain with the original cast!
THE LIGHTING HITTING THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IS ICONICCCCCCC AHHHHHH
Looks cool, but I could do without Patton Oswalt. That brings the cast quality down a notch.
I'll give it a watch, but I'm worried.
Surprised they didn't claim it was climate change! LOL
Excited for mckeena
Finally a Ghostbusters movie tries to be something else than just the first one again!
Yes yes!! I'm exited!! Yes!!
I'm going see this movie but no spoilers allowed!!!
Unbelievably hyped for the sequel 😱❄️
Hopefully it's better than afterlife
Another woke disaster from Sony just as I thought this franchise was getting back on track they come out with this garbage
This actually looks like the kind of follow up to Ghostbusters we asked for👍
You might eventually consider adding some Ghostbusters to the Ghostbusters movie. Who are these people?
YES!! HELL YEAH THEY'RE BACK!!
Yeeeeeeessssssssss!!!!! Can't WAIT, baby!
Ghostbusters Tropical Freeze
Moral of the story: never release an ancient spirit into the world.
Just being back in New York makes it feel more like a Ghostbusters movie.  Looks better than Afterlife.
This looks fun!!! I liked Afterlife but it was kind of weird in that the first half felt nothing like the original but the second half was too much like it. Just judging by this trailer it looks a lot more original but with the classic vibe
So the Question is, who is this New Villain Bringing on the Ice Age? :)
4k views and 11k likes?
Afterlife was really good with the whole nostalgia and seeing the original cast, but i didn't expect to see them in the next film as well and may i just say this is looking really interesting with a brand new story.  Can't wait to see this next year.
Awesome. Also I wonder what the name of this ice ghost will be?
Yes 👍 in the words of sponge bob , I’m ready I’m ready I’m ready 😅
PUMPED
Why Can't Originals just be Left as they are?...
Dont know how to make trailers anymore , where is the ghostbusters music.
Well it looks like ghostbuster was fixed. I my have to go to the movie theater for this one. I never go to the theater.
YAHOO! I CAN'T WAIT! ❤
It’s another over saturated CGI mess. Hope it falls flat on its face at the box office. People deserve original ideas and original films, not shameless cash grabs from dead franchises. Sony pictures is a dumpster fire.
I’ve been a ghostbusters fan since the animated series. It brings a tear to my eye seeing the original ghostbusters crew once again return to the big screen. This movie might end up being better than afterlife!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:29 THAT'S JAMES ACASTER
Something strange froze your neighborhood. Who ya' gonna' call?
Happy to the see the OG cast and this feels like a natural passing the torch move. I would love to see Ray staying as the occult advisor/mentor for the new gen.
If Afterlife was a nod and thank you to Egon/Ramis and the previous genedstion and a start of the new generation, Frozen Empire could be the passing of the torch.
“For the first time in human history, people froze to death in July.” Who forgot the southern hemisphere exists?
Not a fan of the humor so far, don’t like the standard score and the ice spikes … hmmmm, we’ve seen those visuals too many times before. But in general it looks fine
This is like a dream come true. HOLY CRAP YES!
YES!!! Finallly! Lets see something COOL!!!!!! Sorry the pun.
Oh yay Bill Murray loves working with children! ☺️
So much for the global warming narrative.
So excited
Something original from a sequel!
Looks good
GhostBastards
please stop
Just gave me the chills
More woke bs or are we done with that?  I just woke up out of a coma
At what point are these soulless cash grabs considered elder abuse?
I didn't even know this existed. This is a very welcome surprise.
Patton, with all due respect, go to jail immediately.
Let’s Go!!!!!
Nice call on Bananarama.. Who shot their video for that song in Brooklyn overlooking NYC. Great track too !
Cool
They just added some current comedy greats like they did in the past with the main 3.
Always aim for the flat top!!
THIS LOOKS SO COOL
I'm grateful for the inclusivity and diverse cast this movie has
I like to see this new generation of Ghost Busters interacting with the originals.
Any ideas what those red jackets are called at the end, I need one in my life ?
I was in fanboy mode loving this until i see Oswald Patton, just cant stand the guy
That ghost looks absolutely awesome
Omg take my money Sony
All I want is a fifteen second clip of Louis Tully angrily calling his building's Super and complaining that the heat doesn't work.
Sweet 😊
Can't wait
This actually sounds like a Doctor Who episode / villain, and the kind of goofy / serious mix of what that would be will work for Ghostbuster as well.
Any Rumors of Rick Moranis appearance on This movie even Amy pots...
LONNIE QUINN CSB2 meteorologist on the intro, real NY heads listen to Lonnie
Aside from seeing Patton Oswald in the cast, this looks good, but that guy is just like annoying in everything I've seen him in
literally wasnt expecting another Ghostbusters movie after afterlife but honestly pretty Excited and im glad all the characters from afterlife have come back for this especially my Favorite character Podcast
Cruel summer 🤌 I love this! And spring?! God damn
Sounds like a weird premise for a ghostbusters movie.
This looks amazing!!!! I can't wait!!!! 🥶🥶🥶🥳🥳🥳😎😎😎👻👻👻
This is a proper transition to a new generation of Ghostbusters...
We haven’t seen Afterlife in forever so I’ll have to rewatch before this one, it looks great!
Let’s go!!!
I like the trailer, and it puts a lot of adrenaline in my body, I can't wait to get to the cinema.
Given Afterlife was actually fun and honoured fans, I'm so here for a sequel and new villain!!
I NEED THE FROZEN FIREHOUSE LEGO SET
SOOOOOOO THERE!!!!!! Yes!!! What a great Teaser!
Omg yes!!!!!!
I’ve always loved that you don’t have to be in the best shape to be a ghostbuster.  I feel I could do the job well
Oooo  brilliant
So canonically, this trailer now proves that Hedges lives and that Blade III exists in the same universe as Ghostbusters.
Cool 😎.
Please, not the cringe kids again
Winter is coming
Oh thank God. The 4th installment to the original and NOT a sequel to the dumb chick one.
Im here for it
Long Live Gozer!!
Seems like a fun time. Glad afterlife is getting a follow up!
I’m so happy with this ghostbusters reboot writers should take notes this is how you do a reboot. Keep everything the fans love but add to it don’t just put a chick in and make her lame n gay.
GhostBUSTERS.. 🥴
I knew Disneys Elsa is a villain....
1:53 Why does it sound like he trying to be santa claus?
Ok. I'm in !!!!!
I loves me a bit of Ghostbusters
This is going to flop! It needs more women and they need to be gay!
Looks awesome! Can't wait!
I’m on board!  I mean, from me that’s not saying much because I’ve found something to love in every Ghostbusters, but this looks really good and I like that they don’t seem to be retreading any ground from previous movies.  It was kind of a bummer to see them basically recreate the first movie’s climax in Afterlife, so I’m excited to see something new.
YES I am so glad the kids are still in it, I was thinking it was just gonna show the OG only.
The Lich King walkin in
Awesome
The cold never bothered the Ghostbusters anyway.
You know it's crazy it's coming out on the 40th anniversary of this film
This is awesome 😊
batman crossover
They'll ruin this movie before it comes out
Dr. Peter Venkman: Nobody freezes people in my town!
I think this is gonna be a very good movie. March of 2024.
This is waht they should of done in the beginning. Have the OG Ghostbusters in the movie helping and teaching a younger generation of ghost busters. Not  slapped in as random civilian cameo's.
"So Cool" LOL Get it! Cause the movie involves the cold!
name of song in the start?
Good a new ghost. All for it.
Feels like extreme ghostbusters with the old team as teachers for the new. Now we just need slimer in a glass case in the firehouse like in the video game!
Wow this looks great and very epic I can't wait to see it
I guess they finally realised how much of a flop the previous GHOSTBUSTERS movie was and trying to redeem themselves. we shall see
the fact the OG cast is in this mixed with the new cast is incredible! gives me a bit of the Xtreme Ghostbusters vibes. cant wait!
Ogs suited up!!!!!!! Again.
Oh I can't wait to see this!!
Kinda shocked to see Finn and Patt in a movie together after that extremely uncomfortable Stranger Things panel at SDCC some years back. Hoping they buried the hatchet
Thank god you don't put that stupid 5 seconds preview and start the trailer right away
Vecna is back!
Awesome looking forward to this new Ghostbusters movie
Looks better than the last 2.
Ohhhhh red uniforms!!! 😍
oh god, not again. How many times can they reboot this crapfest? I mean, I know you're not gonna want to hear this but, the first Ghostbusters movie back in 1984 was incredibly bland and vanilla.
Yes!!!!  Can't wait
Now that’s a sequel. Rotten tomatoes can eat it
Oh please, oh please, have a Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) cameo at the least.
You really never know when you click on these videos if its fan made,,, , Thank goodness,,, THIS IS REAL. Looks damn good.
Being cautiously optimistic
Let it go, let it go! Can't hold it back anymore. . .
Yep 🎩
This was unexpected
IM SO HAPPY. GHOSTBUSTERS HAS BEEN A PART OF MY CHILDHOOD SINCE MY FATHER INTRODUCED IT TO ME BACK IN 2013. I LOVED EVERY SHOW, ANIMATED SERIES, MOVIE, OR BOOK, AND AFTER LIFE CHANGED IT ALL FOR ME.
See, I loved the first two films. In fact, I thought Ghostbusters II was better... maybe because it was the first one I ever saw. I waited for years for a sequel. And unlike the vast majority of people, I really enjoyed the remake... like an alternative universe of Ghostbusters. I wasn't keen on Afterlife, I found it boring. It was just a rehash of the original Ghostbusters, with barely any sign of our favorite guys, and it wasn't set in the world's most amazing city ever imagined on God's beautiful marble. But I really enjoyed the end when they came together. But this looks amazing. Maybe this time we will see Oscar as an adult, it's his birthright. Also, I'm upset with Rick Moranis... he'll make a comeback in a " Honey I Shrunk..." reboot, but he can't come back as Tully for Ghostbusters?
This feels like something the original ghostbuster's cartoon would come up with!
sirs it is GTA 6's time now shhhhhh
This made my day in a much needed ( personal) time of mine. Thank you ghostbusters...!
This is gonna be fire 🔥
Awesome!
WOW! Looks great! I just hope that I can see Ghostbusters Afterlife before this one comes out! I haven't even seen it yet!
it's..... CLIMATE CHANGEEE!!! *spooky voice*
Thank you for this looks like a other great hit
I accidentally clicked on this video but I'm glad I did
Looks interesting, but that subtitle sucks. Ghostbusters: Death Chill just sounds better.
Of course, none of the icicles stabbed anybody.
So next winter we get Ghostbusters winter coats!
This is going to be awesome and I like the afterlife cast is back for another great adventure
Looks fantastic!  Can't wait to see it!
I WAS NOT PREPARED!!!!!!
RW:CANT WAIT TO SEE IT! 😆👻 🥶
OH HELL YEAH!!!
Looks meh. Again.  But don't let me distract you from the corporate shill comments "It literally gives me chills"
nice booty at :42
I hope this will be at least a 7/10, afterlife was pretty good
This is the proper way to hand it off..  I do like that they're adding new stuff into the mix. Seeing the guys suited and booted is nostalgia overload. Winston looks like he's taking a lead of sorts, which is also cool to see. I bet when that containment unit blows up, you'll see all kinds of ghosts throughout the city like the original. I suspect that Stay Puft is what Paul Rudd is laughing at near the end of the trailer. We'll see!
This is so cool! Definitely looking forward to seeing this one! 👍
i can't wait to see it in the cinemas next year  it looks good
So cool 😎
My body was buzzing watching that...just wow....
YES!!!
interesting
Doesn’t have strong independent woman who aren’t even remotely funny so i am not interested  👊🏿
Wait wait wait can we talk about the shush in the library at 1:16 and then the lions outside the library later😗
Not a bad trailer, but the music for it does not fit.
Glad they had the passing of the torch movie, hope this one puts it firmly in their hands with the new villain.
Happy days I didn't even no they was making this
Paul Rudd: well that just happened
Been seeing little teasers and BTS from this. So nice to see the trailer. Cannot wait for this one. I didn't see Afterlife in the theater, but I will be sure to for this one.
Looks 👍
Looks like we are officially entering a new era of Ghostbusters boys!
That ghost buster car will never get old!
I think I just busted a ghost in my pants.
First time a reboot actually did a good job honouring the original characters and creating something new from the legacy, unlike Indiana Jones at Disney.
Well, I'm intrigued!
It look's So cool
Alright, this actually looks pretty good
Enougth with the bloody kids save the day already. I put up with it in the re boot because it was better than the 2016 dumpster fire.
Most ghosts are usually little more than nuisances (save for the Big Bads), but these are confirmed to KILL.   Getting a real “Real Ghostbusters” vibe to this, and I’m here for it!
Why does the number of likes exceed the number of views?😏boost ?)
Totally forgot that there was gonna be a sequel for this franchise. The opening sequence was actually pretty legit and something from a horror movie and I really liked that. Will def be looking forward to seeing this one
🤞please let this be Good like the last one ☝️
...I'm  ...Cautiously interested.
LETS GOOO
Looking forward to the movie but the trailer sucks like a lot seem to these days. For once I wish someone would use a different editor that doesn't insist on someone going mental on the drums in time with EVERY. LITTLE. THING.
NGL this looks fresh
W MOVIE OPENING
So who’s attacking? The ghost of Elsa?
Awesome
Ghostbusters 2 is a GREAT movie . theend.
Look COOL
Good, Gozer was getting a bit done to death, new villains are always welcome.
we need an EXTREME ghostbusters. the one where one of them was on a wheelchair
80’s children unite in the form of nostalgia
Nice trailer...and the big bad looks pretty, er, cool, but where's the...y'know...ghosts?
Can not wait. Absolutely luv the ghostbusters been watching them since the 80s. Looks like they are back in New York baby. 👻👻👻👻👻
Must see it o,o Ghostbusters and The Day after Tomorrow in one movie
Nothing makes me more hype for this than ray giving exposition. Let's go!!
This is going to be an awesome one!
Rick moranis  time to return
Are we actually getting a Ghostbusters movie, where we don't see the characters becoming Ghostbusters again? great
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO!
I’m stoked
Looks fun
From outta nowhere!? Please be good!
Whatever helps to forget the feminist Ghost busters flop.
HELL YES LETS GO
Surprised they didn't try and race this one out for Christmas (or delay in for summer).
Death chill not an original villian
All those Ice spike and no one got Hit… Ice 🧢 😅 😂
The boys are back.
I wasn’t keen on Afterlife, thought it didn’t understand what made Ghostbusters great. This looks like it has potential - I’m happy to see Hollywood taking some creative risks. And Patton Oswalt is a great fit.
Maybe it can be banished to the Quantum Realm.
Paul Rudd is a Ghostbuster. I didn't know I needed that in my life until now.
I still need to see Ghostbusters afterlife, but I definitely want to see this one, too
Nice. Looking forward to it.
1:36 why does every trailer do this crap  brand of "everything is ironic" humor
Cant wait!!!!!
I'm in
I can't wait to watch it. The RedLetterMedia review. 🤣🤣🤣
Yes please!!  "I love this plan! I'm excited to be a part of it! LET'S DO IT!"
you guys better use the Ghostbusters song in the final trailer.
Looks great! (Patton Oswalt FTW!!!!)
❤❤❤ it's great and amazing ❤❤❤
Please tell me this is REAL!
And you all said the female Ghostbusters was the worst
Squeeeeeeee!!!
Okay……let’s go.
The originals ! Thank you lord jesus
This lioks as bland as Afterlife but its what GB fans deserve
bout to watch this at 10:49 am at a school day.
Can’t freakin wait! Lovin this!
Funny that no one managed to get impaled by all this ice.
THIS is how you continue a franchise and keep it fresh! Excited!
Bring in those Hasbro GhostBusters Toys!!!!
YES!
Woke Busters
Almost sold. Not a fan of Patton Oswald but that's more personal preference.
I hate Patton Oswalt
Oh, yay! I really enjoyed the last Ghostbusters movie. I only ever heard other fans complaining about it, so I'm glad to see there's more coming. Hopefully we'll get to see more Ernie this time around. :D
BOO! Make something new for once.  No one wants to see Ghostbusters 9
So glad to see the OGs back again. Makes me happy
the most impressive thing is the recreation of the 80s (minus the litter on the streets)
Please leave the wokeness behind and give us entertainment, not a lecture.
This one is gonna be fun
That looked really good. Def gonna watch it
PanderBusters: global warming
Thank you ,thank you, Thank you! That is all
Paul Rudd is finally gonna suit up!!! Yes!!!
Looks good!!
I was concerned that Jason didn't direct this himself, but it seems he helped write the screenplay, and he's a producer, so if he's the one who picked the director instead of himself, I'm ok with it.  Given how this trailer looks, I think it could be just what the doctor ordered.
This trailer did give me some chills so it going to be a good one
Bill Murray is gonna die in this. I can feel it.
I wished Bill Murray returned to voice Garfield in the 2024 animated movie.
This is how you create new content and pay homage to the origin. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Suit up and strap up your proton packs we are going back!
Quoting the iconic meme…..  Fry: TAKE MY MONEY!!!!! 🎟️
Nostalgia berries, best served cold
Gay
I can’t get over the awful title, but the movie itself looks pretty good
winters coming
"Well there’s something you don’t see every day"  This looks very cool ;)
Ghost of Elsa!!!! Yes!!!!
God this looks so stupid
Why slimmer isn't here in this movie?
Behold, a movie worth paying money to see in a theater.
Oh yeah I totally forgot about that spirit funny story he's literally worse than anytogether entities and demons throughout world.  But hey maybe the Ghostbusters new ones won't die as he had so good luck.  Oh and also Good Luck with the new Netflix contract series you're going for you'll be needing it.
Looks promising but so did afterlife which sucked.
Looks fun
This actually looks pretty good, glad they are back in New York and continuing from that post credit scene from afterlife. I wonder how much the original ghostbusters will play in this one.
"Let show this ghost-sicle how we do things downtown." 👻🚫
This is not real I don't know what kind s prank this is but it's pretty good
OMG FINALLYYYYYY
<3
this looks fun to watch
I'm super excited for this movie now, I cannot wait to see this 😁😁
niiCCEE!! Ghostbusters!!
Welcome, at long last! Ghostbusters 4! 👻🚫4️⃣
Why is Bill Murphy not listed in the description?
I see the diversity box was checked off.
This is Gotta be epiiiiic🤩
nice!!!!
Nope
YEEEEEEESSSS
That must be some cockroach
LETS GO ORIGINAL CAST NEW CAST AND PAUL RUDD IS A GOD DAM GHOSTBUSTERRRR
YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
When Star Wars the Force Awaken came, they took a lot of old material for nostalgic reasons, in order to reuse old concepts in order to create something new. But when the second film came, they still used old concepts, material and with a dose of zero imagination, instead of creating something new.   Ghostbusters: Afterlife did use a lot of old material for nostalgic reasons, but still made a solid continuation of the Ghostbusters saga. No character was badly used, they introduced a new generation and studied from the past, in order to win the day and heart of all the Ghostbusters fans.  Now the problem with this trailer and the movie is... the big problem is... they are updating old material, but keeping it fresh at the same time and creating something new and original. And the big problem is... we don't know how this movie will turn out to be but the only way to see it, is to go and see this on the cinema. And this trailer gives me a lot of chills, because who wouldn't want to se the Ghostbusters fight a coldhearted villain that is ready to freeze the entire city in order too...? o well, we will see how this will turn out to be. And I'll quote  Mr Groobersons words about this trailer.  "OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOOO!"
Okay, now I gotta say, THIS is the kind of big supernatural threat I was wanting to see. And looks like it's gonna be real scary
Mr. Freeze approves.
I thought this was fan made when i started watching and then OMG this is real?
Looks cool
Yeeesss!!!! Seeing Paul Rudd with a proton pack is what I wanted to see for sure! This all looks amazing
Ghostbusters: Tropical Freeze  The Return of the Snowmads.
You had me at bananarama
Im such a huge Ghostbusters fan, i really wish/hope they tie in the game they released a couple years ago or make ir cannon
This newest film, ''PART 4'',  looks like it gonna be good.   Good to see a few of the original cast members back.
Only Jesus has power
Looks like the neighborhood just got a whole lot stranger, can't wait!
AWESOME! LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS! THE YOUTH ARE GREAT ACTORS AND THE ORIGINALS ARE BACK!
My 6 year old daughter absolutely loves Ghostbusters. The original is her favourite movie she watches it all the time. She is going to be so excited when I show her this trailer.
Looks actually interesting?
Ghostbusters Country Tropical Freeze
This looks great!  I CAN'T WAIT!
Um novo desafio... Para uma nova geração de heróis... QUEM VOCÊ VAI CHAMAR???
So they about to kill off the black girl..... typical
Oh yes! I'm definitely interested and on board!
Thumbs up for Paul Rudd!
👍👍
If the villain isn’t the Boogeyman to finish of this trilogy…..then it’ll be some other villain….
In the words of Mr Freeze: Winter has come at last.
They’re bringing back the firehouse! 😆
I love the nostalgic takes, but this kind of originality to me seems to be worth it! This is new and I think I'm gonna like this movie a whole lot. Also, that Ice Wraith looks like a Class-8 Arctic Environmental Spectral Entity.
Now we're talking! Bring on SPRING!
Love it that the OG cast will be in the new movie.
I'm stoked for this
Wow!
I cant wait
❤❤❤
Not a big fan of the kids version and i dont like Patton i killed my wife Oswalt but i guess i'll watch it for free online later to still give it a try lol
This IS the movie in NY
The Cruel Summer usage (Bananarama Version) 😅
So much yes!
WHOA WELL THATS SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Niiiiiiiiiice!!
The FROZEN EMPIRE is going to have to battle THE NEW EMPIRE at the box office!
Santa has returned to take back summer.
I thought it was going to be called Ghostbusters: Firehouse. Very confused.
Everytime I see a new trailer of an IP I love I really hope that it's not woke or political or progressive. Hopefully this just tells a story about busting ghosts.
Why did part of this give of parasite eve vibes?
I'm going to like this!
winter is coming. it's a white  walker. I'm looking  forward  to this movie
Wow, I am so NOT looking forward to this now.
This looks OUTSTANDING! Funny, scary and .... so cool. See what I did there?
I want to see that so bad! Can’t wait
Funny. I didnt expect a new ghostbusters movie.
$20 says people are gonna go straight to the Ghostbusters theme song after seeing this.
I cant believe we're getting a trailer for a new ghostbusters in the year of our lord 2023. This is bizarre.
The ecto-1 she looks refreshed and beautiful
1:00 I like the engine reving up with the sirens and the U-turn. I hope they bring everyone back to life by the end, the CGI looks great, I like that they extended the cast and the small glimpses at some monsters felt scary.
I don't know.  I think the last five years of crappy/mediocre and woke movies has soured me on anything coming out of Hollywood.  There is literally nothing that I've seen advertised that catches my interest.  I think I'm reverting back to my younger days where I would read a lot of books.  I think I'm going to go back to reading good old paperbacks to get original stories without the Hollywood hype and $40 movies ticket prices
This is what Hollywood should aspire to be more like.
Looks awesome 😊. Great to see Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson in it again 😊
Ghostbusters is now a generic scifi franchise
The Death Chill - literally being scared to death. Now THAT is freaking dark for *_Ghostbusters._*
First: Pual Rudd is a Avenger & now he's a Ghostbuster. Now I really this actor.
The GHOSTBUSTERS Are Back
This ancient artifact could be something like Casket of Ancient Winters from Marvel. It looks awfully familliar to that. Can you imagine if it was really that!?! Great to see original gang back again for this new movie, can`t wait to see it.
who you gonna call roastbusters lol i'm lame
I like how they try to ignore stupidity and crimes by saying this is the first time in New York history that people have frozen to death in July. Walk-in freezers are a real thing.
Honestly, I like this. A darker tone but still got the humor from how the franchise was built on. Plus the mix of the OG busters and the younger members is a nice touch.
Awesome awesome awesome.  I cant wait for this movie
I didn't like the Afterlife, this looked better.
No, thank's...
Maybe the OG Ghostbusters faced the Death Chill many years ago after they defeat Vigo.
Looks f'ing awesome!
Sorry but what the Fk does this plot have to do with Ghosts or Ghost Busting?!
Ill give it an honest shot. Definetly something new, but respecting the OG
Lissandra from League of Legends?😊
I dunno how I feel about this. Ghostbusters are best when tackling the supernatural, not fighting super villains like its a marvel movie. This feels like if G1 started with Gozer or G2 started with Vigo already taking over NYC in the beginning and got a whole movie of that...
This is amazing!!! Paul Rudd wearing the pack and laughing at the end made it for me, but the whole premise seems actually scary. I mean, yeah, Gozer was scary and Vigo had his moments, but this movie has the ability to amp up the horror. Ray talking about people being scared to death is a terrible premise that we get to see in a series that relies on comedy to lighten it up. I can not wait to see this movie. And Bill Murray being right there wearing the suit again is awesome. Patton Oswalt being like a new version of Ray from what I can tell is interesting. This has all the makings of being absolutely fantastic. I can not wait!
This looks amazing can’t wait any longer plz hurry march
This looks so stupid
I wannt to see stay puft again
Still think the title is rather lame and Im not at all thrilled about patton oswalds involvement, but this looks to have plenty of potential.
The ghost awakens.
I like it, looks promising
I got goosebumps when Ecto-1 spun around and looked so badass...I can't wait for this movie!
Wasn't a big fan of Afterlife and was extremely disappointed by it but this looks really good, it's Ghostbusters and I can't not get excited by Ghostbusters.
JO MY GOD "THE DZY BEFORE TOMMOROW" TRYED TO TELL US WHY HAVENT WE LISTEN ???
It's looking good😊🇬🇧❤
This is not ghostbusters Its just bunch of unattractive characters including female protagonists for feminism
I find it hypocritical to see Patton Oswalt in this movie after he openly criticized David Cross for starring in the Alvin and the Chipmunks trilogy in order to pay his mortgage.
I was worried that they be riding to high after the success of afterlife but this dose look vary interesting
THE OG GHOSTBUSTER WAS A MASTERPIECE I LOVE GHOSTBUSTER AFTERLIFE WHEN THE OG BUSTER CAME WAS EPIC I CANT WAIT FOR THIS FLIM GHOSTBUSTER FROZEN EMPIRE WILL BE EPIC CANT WAIT TO SEE IT THE BIG BUGET THIS FLIM LOOKS HYPE IT GONNA BE EPIC
literal chills !
They had me right up until patton oswalt.
Please no more of the same songs and crap, just the original guys and original scores etc. And i see a bunch of new packs and clothes the fans will want lol
I was not expecting a Ghostbusters trailer today.
Paul Rudd is an absolute treasure of a human being
Sad to see Patton Oswald inserting himself in another franchise. Were there no other B list actors who they could have hired for cheaper?
Was that Tacgnol as the enemy?
The OG cast is back (Minus Sigourney...😭) The new cast is back and we have a new original villain! Let's Go! We Got One! 🚨
I sure hope Columbia Pictures comes out with a new logo in honor of the 100th Anniversary.
Awesome 👍🏻
I WILL SEE IT!
Looks awesome, not some pandering cop out
This looks awesome!!!!! Can't wait .
I really loved Afterlife so I am excited to see whats next for this new team. Mckenna and Logan are fantastic imo.
Notice there staying very far away from the remake
It’s Gozer, doing her shenanigans again. What a rapscallion.
Can’t wait!!!
Dont be woke please
You have my attention.
Crazy how this video has 4,000 more likes than views in its first hour, wonder if that could possibly mean anything about this movie?
New villain ghost with ice ability?!
Perfection. Absolute perfection.
well that was underwhelming, dreadful title.    Not sure why people need ghostbusters when  any random child or adult can be a ghostbuster, bring back scientists!.    Still a bit sad how the wrote out the events of GB2, and the still reluctant to use the originals properly, the camos are kinda the filmmakers going  'if we have to'      Hopefully it'll be alright
Elsa is on one again.
CAN. NOT. WAIT!!!
Saw the poster in a theater before the trailer came out which is kind of rare these days. Really friggin hyped for this Afterlife was so good!
Afterlife was fantastic for fans of the OG Ghostbusters. So to see them continue the story from there really makes me happy.  Really hope it will love up to the hype.
YEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS YEEEEESSSSSSSSSS  I'm speaking as a fan here,  Afterlifes "weakness" was its reliance on nostalgia, that for some overstepped at the end slightly.  But... if this is a good film, then I think even the fans that didn't like Afrerlife for that reason, could maybe see that it's been recontextualised a little as " that was the end of those three stories, and now new stories can begin".
Oh my god come up with something new already.   DO U REMEMBER THE GHOSTBUSTERS?  DO U REMEMBER ECTO-1?  DO YOU REMEMBER DAN AKROYD AND ERNIE HUDSON?  Pathetic.
Sweet
Oh I thought this was a fan edit at first lol  Actually kinda hyped
Why Feels like Original Ghost Busters Actors will be Push aside less role...  A Teacher From Last Film just leaves his town from the afterlife film to be Ghostbuster...   Original Cast better  Rick Moranis in this film  U gotta let me in Fix this Film
I'm glad Ghostbusters seems to have found it's grove again with Afterlife & didn't let 2016 throw it into obscurity forever.
Gho(st)! Busters! 👍
So the team is literally a mom, her two kids and her bf?
Todays my birthday this just made my day
Man, New York is attracting ghosts like Tokyo attracts Godzilla.
Isn’t this just the plot of Angry Birds 2?
This trailer had me at Bananarama's "cruel summer" 😊😊😊😊😊
MORE! MORE!
IMHO Afterlife was not successful in passing the torch between the old and the new generation, so I am really happy to see that there will be another film with the legacy team.
This looks a lot better than that boring nostalgia s*** show that was Afternlife!
Omggggg so hyped for this can’t wait!!! Love the new concept!
YES YES YES  IS IT A BAD THING THAT I BEING 41 YEAR OLD TEAR UP EVERY TIME I HEAR A PROTON PACK START UP 😂😂😂😢
Looks like an episode of The Real Ghostbusters and I mean that as a compliment. Also looks like the threat is based on the real life Great White Hurricane that hit New York City in late March with little warning.
Wow. I give them total credit for coming by with the idea of a ghost FREEZING New York. Definitely not something we've seen from a Ghostbusters movie before. Haha.
What happened to this franchise? Straight down the gutter.
Too bad Patton Oswald murdered his wife after she caught him with their daughter.
So Ghostbusters vs Lissandra from LOL?
AAAH!!! SO EXCITED
This is The Real Ghostbusters coded live action sequel I've always wanted.
hard to get excited after the last two outings.
Ohhhh hohoho. Nice!
I can't wait!
Looks cool ( pun intended ).
Take my Money...
A couple of casting decisions I question, but I will be there opening weekend!
As long as Gozer has nothing to do with this, not her cousin, or brother, or offspring, or relative.  I’m happy.
Ghostbusters: Tropical Freeze
Honestly I’m pretty excited for this film like I love the first two original Ghostbusters movies I love afterlife that was a good third chapter within the franchise so I’m really excited for this one and seen ever going to use more of an original ghost villain in this one it’s gonna be pretty cool no pun intended
I’m so glad Jason Reitman ignored the behavior misconduct allegations against Bill Murray. Dr. Peter Vankman is the heart and strength of the Ghostbusters quadrilogy.
Alright, the kids r back!!! I was thinking of a show based the Afterlife movie: "Ghostbusters: Next Gen"
Awesome!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This it's fire 🔥🔥
GHOSTBUSTER 1 WAS MASTERPICES  GHOSTBUSTER 2 SEQUL TO MASTERPICES GHOSTBUSTER AFTERLIFE I LOVE THIS FLIM NOW WE GETING 4TH GHOSTBUSTER MOVIE CANT WAIT FOR GHOSTBUSTER FROZEN EMPIRE
Incredibly psyched for the next installment. I got chills seeing Winston strappin' and Peter in uniform, and looks like, more screen time for the Firehouse.  Anyone catch the denim Ray was wearing?  Is that the same one from '84?  Lots of new faces and a continuation of the OG Universe .... Love it!
Its probably Vigo the Carpathian again, XD seriously, glad they continued the Afterlife continuity
Paton Oswald should NOT be in this movie.
W  O  K  E
BRO YES!!!
Hype!!!!
I hope this sequel has the Run DMC song in it.   Something strange goin on Something's wrong Gloom in the room Outside is the storm  Chill down your spine Your heart fills with fright Not filled by the things That GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT
Hey! Paul Feig! Where's YOUR Ghostbusters sequel!?
This looks great. The use of Coney Island and of course seeing the Original Ghostbusters...FANTASTIC
another near 3 hour film that will end up rubbish
I think we can all agree that Paul Rudd's expression at the end is everyone watching this today...
I am so happy they did this franchise right this time. Let the kids take over, but properly pass the torch first like the last movie, not like how SW did by basically wasting the OG. If this is good, I would welcome a third movie with this young cast.
Damn
Thank you
This reminds me of the movie trailers I grew up watching. All that's missing is a guys saying "THIS SUMMERRR!".
waoooo
Ice Ghost
Sony, you got me excited, well fuckng done.
0:43 why does this scene in the trailer reminds me of geostorm?
I have no words for how happy I am right now!!!!!!
Just yes yes yes ❤❤❤❤❤
Wow 😊
part 4?
WE GOT ONE! ⏰ 🚨
Not what I was expecting but finally glad to see Paul Rudd as a ghostbuster since out of the new cast he's the one who most looks like he could be a ghostbuster.
dam this looks good!
This looks great!
I'm seeing things running through my head.
Did they even bother to wake BIll Murray up to deliver that dialogue?
New York? The OG cast? A NEW villain? 🤩 Oh yeah, we're back baby!
It is too bad it includes the homicidal maniac from the Afterlife movie. Would have been better without her.
Can't wait!!!
Can we take a moment to appreciate and acknowledge the fact that Bill Murray has played Dr. Peter Venkman four times 34 years after Ghostbusters II arrived in movie theaters.
Take my money! 💰💰💰
Let's gooooooo 🎉🎉🎉🎉
the death chill!? this is gonna be interesting!!
Another woke ghostbusters,
I feel just as excited as Dan Ackroyd sounds reading this soulless moneygrab rubbish. Goodbye creativity.
Let’s go!! Pete, Ray, and Winston are back!
This looks soooo Good :) definitely gonna watch. Just hope the final product is as great as this trailer
Meh.
This is just what we needed. Afterlife showed us they knew how to do a Ghostbusters movie. Now they're bringing it back to where it all began and giving us a brand new villain, the first in this continuity since Vigo. Can't wait to see where it goes.
There's something strange in the neighborhood who you gonna call
Yes the OG's and the New Team Unite!
WHY
Ok, cool let's see what they can pull off this time, I'm not gonna hold my breath that it'll be amazing but I am certain it will have enough good qualities for me to call it another worthy continuation of the original
F*** YESSS LETS GO!!
I’m calling the ghostbusters! ❤ so happy we are getting a sequel
this looks good cuz a bunch of very talented and very experienced actors are in it. Without them it would be a CGI festival with zero quality 👍
Wow.   As a man, born in 1978 I was old enough to see every ghostbusters in cinema. And this one will not be skipped.   LOVELY!
"Let's release this winter-y summer blockbuster in the spring!" - every stupid executive ever
That honestly looks pretty dope
It's finally here
WOW! I thought it was being uploaded tomorrow and having just watched this I am certainly not disappointed and 100% EXCITED!  It's great to have Peter, Winston, Ray, Janine, Trevor, Lucky, Phoebe, Podcast, Callie and Mr Grooberson back, but the only thing that I'm actually disappointed at is the lack of Dana Barrett, as Sony didn't ask Sigourney Weaver to reprise the role. It would be as if they made an Alien 5 and didn't ask her to come back as Ripley. COME ON SONY WE NEED SIGOURNEY!
no pun intended.. chills literal chills watching this
sweet
Even though I’m not a huge ghostbusters fan I’m glad that good ghostbusters movies are finally being release😅
Put a chick in it and make her gay!
Ghostbusters: Tropical Freeze
Afterlife was the wonderful reconnecting and send off for Egon we needed as fans.  This looks like it goes into new, dare I say, animated series territory, and I cannot wait.  Brings tears of nostalgia to these eyes every time.
I am so glad this is happening! Looks actually better than I expected. Love the direction of new gear added in to the old legacy tech.
Oh thank the heavens this has not been destroyed
Brought tears to my eyes 😊
Paul Rudd is having the time of his life in this series!
The villain is Elsa from Frozen
Looks like they may have finally got it right! An original villain, a mix of old and new cast and a genuinely fun looking plot. It’s the first time I’ve seen a ghostbusters sequel advertised and could see them continuing a series of new fresh stories within the franchise rather than it be a long overdue sequel or unnecessary reboot.
I cannot wait for this one.
So there fighting ICE KING….  Okay, I dig that idea! Welcome back Ghostbusters! We all missed ya. 😁
I wonder if this ghost is going to be something like Jack Frost?
I’m really hyped for this movie, I really enjoyed Ghostbusters 1, 2, and Afterlife. Now I’m really excited to see this film.
Calling it: Paul Feig is gonna make another rant over this.
Excited 🤗
I am SOOO glad Winston is FINALLY getting more shine!!! 😆
Welp, I always wanted more of an animated Ghostbusters movie but I guess this one's cool cuz' the title "Frozen Empire" makes me think about December since X-Mas' my favorite holiday besides Halloween :) or in other cases that one SB episode I enjoyed alot called Frozen Face-Off lol.
my childhood 🥲
Who we going to call 🚫👻🚫
So they took the hell freezing over idea and changed it to New York 🤔 I’m excited to see this
They'll be back again and they'll have new uniforms to.
I can't wait for RedLetterMedia to cover this movie.
1st hour club
😂
I love having a corpse of a franchise that shouldn't be paraded around like some sort of crappy avengers wanna be event.
Cue Climate Change deniers...
Great another CGIathon 😞
Wonder if that's the ghost is the wife Patton Oswald unfunny as kiled
I just need to know what happened to the librarian ghost.
Awesome teaser trailer.
Not where I saw this franchise going that's for sure.
This feels like an episode of the real Ghostbusters.
Hell yesss
meh
Yesssssssd
C'mon bring my boy slimer back in this one
This looks like a good follow up to Afterlife!
Finally we get to see Rudd as part of the Ghostbusters Team! This looks really good! Can't wait to see this new GB movie!
We can't wait!
I've always absolutely loved Ghostbusters, and I was afraid that Afterlife was going o be the last one. Now seeing this, I'm SO excited to see Ghostbusters once again, as I had laughed, cried, and cheered for Afterlife. Also seeing the OG Ghostbusters gang, even if it's only the three of them :(, is super exciting. I'm hoping for the best for this movie and can't wait to see more teasers and content along the way.
Yes please!!
Yes yes yes!!!!!
Let’s goooooooooooooooooooo
Let’s go🧡
Looks great, apart from Twatton Oswalt. Does he not have other YouTubers to bully?
I have even higher hopes for the soundtrack now!
Before 1 hour and 4000 views
I thought they were calling Ghostbusters 4 Ghostbusters firehouse. But aside from that I'm excited to see it.
I’m super excited for this! It’s nice to see the franchise take a unique turn by including a new villain and a new threat, and I can’t wait to see this next year!
Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!
What a “cool” trailer
Afterlife was weird, ghostbusters was two comedy movies about schlubby scientists becoming heroes, not a sweet or nostalgic bone in its body, to go that route fir the reboot was weird, maudlin, missed the mark and missed the point-even more odd when you take into account it was directed by Ivan reitmans son…this one, on the other hand, could be better because it’s a new separate story , but seriously, we gotta stop wheeling out these nostalgia project, bringing back actors 30/40 years later etc… it’s lazy, it’s cliched…just stop
Yess! I'm so HYPED for this!
I approve
After watching this trailer, I want to rewatch the Ghostbusters movies
God these disney live action remakes are getting ridiculous. At least they're apparently trying to be more original with Frozen
YES!!! New unique villains for the Ghostbusters 🎉 YES 🔥 this is what they need to do going forward New ghost villains and bring back some of the villains from the animated series
Going to be the BEST movie of 2024!!! I can’t wait!
There back in business
Well this just made my week.  Awesome!
Duuuuude this is going to be siiiiiiiick
Yaaaaas! I'm all in! 🎬
Frozen empire. Not a big fan of that name
People don't realize that the original Ghostbusters was perfect because it was a workplace buddy comedy that happened to have ghosts in it. Now they're just trying to make Stranger Things.
Bill murray........❤
Lame and dull just like afterlife
MEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Poor New York! City goes through so much 😢
Hang about, is that James Acaster is in this movie?! What the heck?
God I wish Harold Ramis was still alive
Wow Bill Murray is back
YES PLS!
my neighbors probably think im tweaking again. i just clapped so loud when i saw earnie bill and dan.
Please don’t let this be a prank
Is that Lissandra? :P
The only thing that would have made this preview even better would be a Melissa McCarthy cameo.     But if they can't get her, I'd settle for Leslie Jones.
Wow this looks intriguing
Looks good 👍
Who you gonna call….
LETS GOOOOOOOO
Good to see The Knight King getting more work.
another frozen movie?:D nice! let it go!
Bill Murray was in a frame!
I WAS FROZEN TODAY !
Looks good, I'm excited!
Let's Go!! Loved the last one. Brought tears to my eyes and childhood nostalgia. Gonna see this one too.
Yay sequel
Not gonna lie this 2 mins has me interested 👍
Isn't that just lissandra from league of legends? Cmon man
MY BODY IS READY
I'm going to need to recheck the spirit guide for this ghost.
COOL!!! =D
This movie looks awesome! I can't wait to see it! Its a great time to be a Ghostbusters fan. I love it. I love it!
I wish they would stop with just this trailer. This shows just enough to make the movie look good but not too much. No need for a “full trailer” that shows every action scene and a “final trailer” that shows part of the ending.
I’m in!
Wow! So excited!!
Yessssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!
Opening night!!! IMAX!!
Forget 2016, let's go new Ghostbusters
✨👏🏾
Hey Game of Thrones we found your missing Winter! I think we found who you should have called.
The first was kind of a remake.  This one looks totally original!!!  Who ya gonna call?
3500 views and 5000 thumbs up?  Something strange going on…
GHOSTBUSTERS
So... Elsa is the new villain. Cool.
honestly my excitement for this is alot rn
This has Extreme Ghostbusters vibes and I'm all for it🎉🎉🎉
Who you gonna text?
Thank God this is *not* a sequel to that unfunny, cringeworthy, feminist bullsh!t version.
Can I win because I am a fan of the franchise of the movie Ghostbusters both originals, Ghostbusters movies I’m a big fan and I cannot wait that movie of the Ghostbusters movie forever life I think
This looks AWESOME!!!! 🚫👻🧊💥
WHO YOU GONNA CALL?  GHOSTBUSTERS!!!!
Aww, Patton Oswalt is in this? That's a shame.
I wish they wouldn’t lean on CGI so much.
The kids and the OGs together! This is exactly what I wanted!
So looking forward to watching this!!
yo what?! yes please
This honestly looks like its gonna be dope as hell and actually scary! I love that they are actually giving the original cast more to do here as well.
Well, I am bursting with happiness, and it makes me feel good.
Man i'am already imagine a videogame about this movie, like the ones from PS2, it would be awesome
They should keep making movies about THE big ghost threats.  Next movie should come out in October,  and the main villain should either be Samhain or the Boogeyman.
Yeeeesssss ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh no~!~~~ It's the climate change ghost!!! Kill it with fire!
Wait, no sequel to the all female  GhostBusters?!?!?    REEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!'nn
I wonder who that guy with the blonde hair and wearing the black framed glasses was? Could he be related to Louis Tully?
Looks good. I hope they are making plans for a third one, which should take place on Halloween and bring Samhain to the big screen.
Bill Murray 😍😍😍😍
"Sony Pictures® presents: A new adventure From the producer behind Smosh™ the Movie and Pixels™ Ghostbusters Frozen Empire"  Ghostbusters, they're back in town And this time, one of them is actually dead Bless you Sony® And bless you Money® With Money® Anything is possible  Did you know That the official soundtrack of Ghostbusters has less views Than my album  But that's why Sony® is truly the best They give me Money® to make this soundtrack to the movie Thank you so much I know one guy is dead But with CGI, anything is possible  "Alright, Mister Joel..."  "Y-y-yes...?"
To think we live in a timeline now where Ghostbusters 4 exists is kinda surreal. But I'm all in.
Original cast (maybe not Aykroyd) will be frost (Ernie Hudson said, time ago, he was a little dissapointed with his screentime this time too)  The family will be the ones who save the situation in this occasion. Mark my words. Even so, I´m in!
What no way!!! Awesome! 👏🏼
no way
Ghostbusters IV: Frozen Empire is gonna be awesome!  Just in time for Ghostbusters 40th Anniversary.
Red jumpsuits slap, ngl. I love that look so much more than I ever expected to.
Definitely feeling this one more. Looks like the OGs are gonna be co stars instead of cameos. Afterlife was Ok, leaps better than the girl version, but thats not hard to do lol, i still wasnt crazy about it. It never felt like a ghostbusters film to me, it lacked the tone and humor of the originals. Felt more like a nickelodeon movie
That ghost looks terrifying!!  So happy to see a new villain. I have a bad feeling venkman’s gonna die though.
I would love to see the ghost of Egon Spengler again.
Ух, жду. Это будет круто.
Why people keep employing Patton Oswalt is beyond me but other than that looks ok.
This is epic!
Not bad, briliant teaser, doesn't ruin anything and keeps the nostalgia and builds on the original legacy, with a new villain, and expanding lore.
LET"S GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
Yes!!!
Yes!
Cant believe ant-man is helping out
Ghostbusters Is Back!!!
I hope Patton Oswalt has minimal screen time
Ok, Im flipping excited! Glad to see both OG and New Team GB handling up.
Looks neat.   Hope they bring back Oscar.
I can't wait 😊
LOOKS SO LEGIIIIIIT!!!!!
Hopefully it's more entertaining than Afterlife.
Errrrrrr this looks like a horror movie to me . Why do you guys have to take an original idea and spoil it ….. too much time in your hands . I read the book before the first film came out ….. guys leave it alone . The trailer doesn’t even have the theme tune .
The OG remaining ghostbusters get frozen by new villain and the new generation saves the day. I'm all in
Im ready!
Please don't be woke.
Lets gooo
Good to see that the Original Ghostbusters appear in this sequel to guide the upcoming ghostbusters
Now this looks ... utterly fantastic!!
As someone who got _tears_ of nostalgia from the climax of Afterlife being _described_ ... I am so there.
Ghostbusters Ghostbusters 2 Ghostbusters The Videogame (2009 one obviously) Ghostbusters Afterlife which paid respects to Harrold Ramis  Ghostbusters Frozen Empire, should've been released for December!! Pls put the date back Sony!! Both FNAF and Ghostbusters 4 were in production at similar time frames and were done at the same time, FNAF wasn't affected by the strike but somehow Frozen Empire was? Makes no sense!! Pls put it back to December!! The very least the end of December!! 🙏🏼  Especially the film was screened for fans, so its only fair lol  Notice how I didn't bring up the one between 2015 & 17 BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIST!! It ain't canon to the franchise because that awful director ignored the original films and insulted us fans so it's only fair the director's son of Ghostbusters 84 does the same and see how it feels lol
😊
We're back!
This looks REALLY good!
Hopefully it'll be revealed to be the ghost of Mr Freeze with more ice puns!
Do we really need Patton Oswalt though? He's terrible
That would be me 😆 🤣
Ok I just got chills
Yeah looks good.
Damn I was expecting Ghostbusters vs Sub Zero
After enjoying Afterlife, I've no doubt that Frozen Empire will be a worthy, chilling (no pun intended) successor!
I’m reminded of that fake movie trailer from Tropic Thunder where Ben Stiller’s character is returning to a long running franchise where the big twist in the newest sequel is that the character has to fight through a global sized frozen wasteland.
Gb Afterlife surprised me and this looks good. Can't wait
this looks way better than Wokebusters 2016! beyond disrespectful to the OG in '84! and this is coming from someone that isn't a diehard Ghostbusters fan! LOL
Let's goooooooo
Just do woke it up at all yeah, GO WOKE GO BROKE
Please stop, its bad enough theses days without the continued bastardisation of my childhood
Back home LOVE it looks amazing. I got CHILLbumps!
😮😮 A NEW VILLAIN !!! Let Gozer and Vigo rest in our collective memories and exciting that theyve introduced a new baddie FINALLY😢
THAT ACTOR FROM Eternal's is horrid, overly camp and very irritating
I have been a loyal ghost head for over 36 years and I was there opening weekend to see GB: Afterlife. I was crying my eyes out at the end of the film. I am really glad they are doing this film and Afterlife the right way. Reminding us about what made the original so wonderful but bringing something we’ve never seen in the films! It literally brings chills down my spine pun intended!
I hope Mr Stay Puft is in it!!!
Loved Ghostbusters afterlife can't wait for this movie also Ghostbusters 1984 turns 40 year's old next year
How in the holy hell does this have more like than views
Yes!
OMG, yes I love that trailer, also the OG Ghostbusters are back in business once again 😂❤
Ok, this looks great!
YES - something NEW.  This is gonna be fun!  All in!
Is no one gonna talk about the fact this is giving off Shandor Island vibes (from the Ghostbusters 2009 video game)? And on top of that the Fisherman Sargassi implication too.  I'm not 100% saying it's him and the route they're gonna go, it just seems that way to me
I'll pay money to go see this.
So the Ghostbusters are fighting Elsa… honestly did not see that one coming 😂
Didn't Patton Oswalt kill his wife? Why isn't he in prison?
Lookin good here folks...
Let's gooooo
Nice, this looks pretty damn good. Looks like they'll be doing some original with this one and I'm all there for it. Afterlife was awesome and brought the series back and is my favorite, so, seeing they did another one, hell yea. Can't wait.
The next one should have the boogeyman I would be perfect for it
Now we need a Columbia 💯 logo
Yessss not going to be a nostalgia bomb
Not bad. As long as they keep the melodramatic stuff to a minimum this time, it can be watchable
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I think this will be the fully passing mantle over to the kids, most likely wont get another film for a good 2 or so years so the kids can age up.
Yes!  Looks awesome!  Can’t wait!
Omg
YES!!!
I'm gonna be scouring the spirit guides in the old ghostbusters games to find any reference to cold ghosts after this
the ecto's siren will ALWAYS give me chills.
I love it already
Mab is angry and taking it out on New York City.
I'll be pretty excited to see what kind of ghost is behind this big of an apocalypse 😊
Okay. I'm sold. This can't come any sooner.
Yesssss, my favorite film is come back!
Not gonna lie but this trailer actually gave me chills, I’m so ready for this. Also a original villain 🎉
WE GOT ONE!!!
That was the quickest and fastest 2 minutes I've ever experienced in a trailer
Oh my god that came outta nowhere!!
This is how you do it!!  New blood and Old Guard working together!!
MORE!!! MORE!!! MORE!!! MOOOOOOOORE!!! ❤❤❤
1:51 nICE to meet you...
0:42 Butt, butt, butt...
Damn it Elsa Just let it go Don't go Frozen om me
God, I can’t wait for this movie. It literally gives me chills.😂🥶
yes!
LOOKS AMAZING!!
so glad we got one amazing Ghostbusters movie and enough relaunches sequals respins and trash to make us almost hate the original.  Remeber when the carton was the thing you used to giggle about?
Cant be worse than the last one. That mf was BORING
Looks brilliant
Here we go!
This entire trailer gives me chills!!!!  (No pun intended)     (Ok, pun intended)
aside from Patton Oswald this looks like it's going to be really cool :D
All the OG Ghostbusters are here...almost...so you know what,no, WHO, we need? Even as a cameo? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!
LETS GOOOO!!!!!!
The true heroes of this film will be all of the Ghost Dads who find the thermostat and turn it back on...
When the retirement does not the pay the bills.
I'll be seeing this opening day, for sure.
@redlettermedia
Can. Not. Wait!
I LOVE IT! LETS GOOOOOOO
I, Vigo, the Scourge of Carpathia, the Sorrow of Moldavia, command you!  We need to hear this one last time!!
As a Ghostbusters fan who has seen the original movie and Afterlife, a worthy sequel (I saw it with my dad and we loved it a lot) I am super eager to see more of my favorite team ❤🤩👻
PAUL RUDD IS BACK OH MY GOD
The villains silhouette looks kind of like Zarok from MediEvil! Plus Zarok is know for coming back from the dead now and again... totally Zarok.
So Ghostbusters meets the day after tomorrow? Might work
The theme better be during the movie this time, multiple times. Pay Ray Parker Jr. what he wants.
Song name at the beginning?
GIMME GIMME GIMME
Like when Elsa leaves Arendelle and goes to New York
This looks amazing
Did Sony forget that Ghostbusters was a comedy franchise?
Now this is something we all like to watch. The next generation of the ghostbuster
I can not wait to see this movie….take my money now!!!!
YESSSSS!!!!!!!! Back to NYC babyyy!!!!
Completely surprised to see Venkman again, and his appearance not even being kept a secret! Can't wait!
I ain't 'fraid of no........HOLY SH**!
Yes! Hope stay puff returns. Wonder who this new villan is?
Interesting Ghostbusters story, can't wait to see it!
Krampus is the ghost???
So excited for this!
WE CAME. WE SAW. WE'RE FROZEN!
The death cloud, the OGs teaming up with the New Bloods, is it just me or does this really remind of the finale of XGB?
I love the Ghostbusters especially when they bring the new faces to joins them and became the new generation and they pay tribute to Harold, who played egon
Yes yes yeeees❤
Welcome back Ghostbusters! We missed you!
Gonna be another epic Ghostbusters film!👻🚫❄️🤩
Ok now I’m excited!!! We get an original villain and Paul Rudd as a ghostbuster?!?
Love seeing the mix of Old and New Busters! So refreshing to see the Ecto back on the streets of NYC! This looks phenomenal! Cannot wait.
OMG. Take my money!
This is gonna be great!
Looks better than Afterlife already.
Looks Wonderful.  Just keep giving the paying customers what they want and cash checks.  Not hard guys
@gameovergreggy
This is going to be such a great movie!
This just means in gonna suit up for the movie with all my busting gear
As a Non Ghostbusters fan, I'm impressed. I guess...
I'm totally going to see it!
GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS
Well done, guys. :)  I loved the recent Ghostbusters: Afterlife movie, and this feels like another great sequel. Ghostbusters is back!
❤
Well this was unexpected, I thought Afterlife was meant to be the official end to the live action Ghostbusters films. But I guess they've come up with new ideas for a storyline, And thankfully it's an original idea.
Are you a god???
A little more intense than I was expecting. Did anyone actually die in the others except Egon?
Seems Hollywood finally was able to pass on the torch.
I know spirits are supposed to send a chill down your spine but the is something else.  Can’t wait to see this
I want those jackets! Gimme those jackets! Where's the preorder store at?!
Patton Oswalt murdered his wife
Yes I’ve been waiting for ages for this can’t wait to see it 😁
Aw man, I thought it was gonna be the New Jersey parallelogram 😉
Make it stop!
I’ve watched this more times than I’d like to admit. I’m emotionally moved by all things ghostbusters and this is no exception.
Get rid of those snotty kids!
Villain actually looks sick cl
Lookkkks great cant wait to see it🔥
uh oh someone forgot to write some…. jokes.
Why has this become a blockbuster action series, Ghostbusters was a comedy ffs
Looks stupid. Pass
Epic! Let's go! 🚫👻🥶
An original villain sounds like it’s going to be awesome!!!
Afterlife was a perfect movie and the true sequel that fans have wanted for decades. I'm so excited to see what this next movie has in store!!!
LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!  This looks so freaking awesome! Evil Elsa (lol, jk but I can't be the only one who thought that lol).
Louis Tully needs to be in this!
1:53 That same laugh he made in Captain America Civil War when he became Giant Man.
Finally after these year it finally came out
Awsome
Yeeeeees
WoW sure is really cool 🤩
I'm afraid the old ghostbusters will die in this new movie 😢😢😢
awesome
Strange concept. We'll see.
Hammer Trailer freue mich schon riesig drauf 👻🚫
Weak
LET'S GOOOOOOOO
Meh. I like that they try to tell an original story but the trailer has too many Ghostbusters in it and some mediocre CGI that have become too much of a common standard in Hollywood. I mean, come on, CGI Shoes hanging in the streets. It now feels just like another franchise blockbuster action-comedy. I'm not sure if I'm down with that. Let's see.
WOW. They've done it again. This is so awesome to see. This franchise was dead for over 30 years and now they're about to put out another great movie with the originals included. Salute to everyone involved. 🫡
Also I’d like to see that Cadillac Escalade Ecto can’t have ol girl out in the snow like that
It' so cool ❤❤❤🚫👻
Whoa
Ghostbuster in the snow? Well... as long as my beloved legacy characters aren't only relegated to 10 minutes at the end of the movie, count me in! I loved GBA for what it was... but was left disappointed by the relatively short amount of screen time the OGs were given. I don't mind the new characters... it would've been nigh on impossible to do a new movie without some "new blood", so to speak... but let's even out our focus a little bit this time around, yes?
Looks good but  Oprah: You’re a Ghostbuster, you’re a Ghostbuster and You’re a Ghostbuster! 😂 Is my main take away from the trailer. Looks like there’s 20 Ghostbusters in the movie.
So intrigued buy this villain. so excited to see this and hopefully its another smash hit for the franchise.
It's Elsa! ❄
All right ghost heads and trailer hounds: millisecond by millisecond breakdown! GO!
City freezing over cuz of a supernatural entity - very similar to an episode of the Robot Monkey Hyperforce cartoon.
If they use this movie as an excuse to kill off Winston, the ghosts won’t be the only thing about this film that’s dead to me.
Looks good!!!
They're back
Ok I'm intrigued. I mean I'm not not gonna see it
Hell Yeah I love it ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
It’s all happening today. GTA 6, Ghostbusters. Today is a happy day.
You had me at 0:42
Time to Let it go!
When is "soon", i need a date 😤
Instant Jaws imagery and Richard Dreyfus voice over! What's that about?
this just came out of nowhere but this is going to be insane
OMG
Even looked like an 80's-90's movie at the start.
ONGAFGA
Sweet, Sweet Victory
Omg this is amazing! Wish we didn’t have to wait until spring!
that´s how you make a ghosbuster movie !!!!
ESTABA ESPERANDO ESTO, GRACIAS 😭😭❤️❤️
I get the feeling that 1 or all of the OGs are gonna die in this one...😖 I hope I'm wrong.
Still not a fan of women and children suiting up with packs on but at least we’re getting another film. Hopefully we’ll at least get more of the OG’s in this film but I have a feeling that the quick shot we see of Venkman in this trailer might be him getting killed off with the death chill. Hope that does not happen.
Patton Oswalt murdered his wife
This totally not feeling like some fan service sequel but just a great scary movie is awesome!
NGL - this looks awesome!!
I just hope the containment unit can hold that. So excited!
I'm on board.
wow wow wow, por fin,,,,,,, ya ponganla ,, ahora si  de regreso al cine, yeah
Woooooo hoodoo I can't wait!!!!!!!
Excellent, I'll be there
gimme that james acaster content bebe!!!
I can already see modifications to the proton pack! Can't wait to see  more!!
WE BACK BABY!! 🔥🔥
I need to get me a red coat to put my patches on
This looks awesome 🚫👻
Is this a Ghostbusters movie or Day After Tomorrow 2? And Patton Oswalt is in it? Hard pass.
❤
I'M ALL IN!!!
This actually looks like it could be better than Afterlife.... awesome concept that I’m definitely excited for.
❤
Let’s see how this gose
Looks like the Ghostbusters are taking on Mr. Freeze. Lol 🥶 This looks interesting
BRO, IT’S AMAZING!!!!! YAYYYYYY🤜🤛
AHHHHHHHH!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is gonna be good!
Omg Bill is back!!!
Really looking forward to seeing this!
Who you gonna call?!!!?!?!! This looks awesome!! A brand new villain has me excited!! The original cast still kicking around is chefs kiss!! Let’s go!!! 👻
Maravilloso!!!!!!
Bring it on!
Awesome... simply Awesome!!
I can't wait until the premiere
Terrible
Is that James Acaster??!!! I'm in!
Well all the good work from Afterlife capturing the tone and feel appears to be gone. Looks just like another sensationalised disaster movie that just happens to have Ghostbusters in it.
It rocks!
The subtitle, HELL FROZEN OVER was right there....
This a sequel to the 2021 one?
Villain looks like it is gonna be awesome ❄️
now im pump
💜🙏🏻
Interesting direction for ghostbusters film. It feels like one of the episode from the real ghostbusters.
Love it! Love it! Love it!
Patton Oswalt 🤦
Yes,I can’t wait !
This looks way better than Afterlife.  I'm so set for this 🚫👻❄️
I see the OG cast, I see the Afterlife cast. I'm very happy! Bring it on.
Everybody chill.  The trailer is here.
Let's go
No love for Podcast :(
Who. You. Gonna. Call
Can. Not. Wait. To see. This!! Yessss!! 👻🚫
Greatest movies of all time (apart from 1 of the remakes) 😂
YES!!!!!!!!
Awesome looking!  But lets drop Patton Oswalt.
I'm down with this. Who's with me?
YES
CAN’T WAIT FOR THIS TO GO OUT, I MISS MY GHOSTBUSTER PHASE
The girl who plays egon grand daughter is perfectly casted she looks just like him and I'm so happy we get to see Bill Dan and Ernie back once again I'm excited for this
LETS GOOOOOOO!!!
Man I can’t wait to see this when it comes out hope they do some kind of giveaways if you watch in premium format opening weekend
The new ghostbusters movie is officially coming 👻
Finally the new ghostbusters trailer has came! i am so excited to see it when it come out! i love the new title of the new ghostbusters Frozen Empire! can't wait to see it! 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
What is this nonsense? EPIC FAILURE!
❤
Absolutely can’t wait!
The first new one was great. Shall be watching this one to.
Finally. It is time baby
Looks awesome! So glad they’re back in NYC and they even brought back the OG crew
Ahhh I'm so hyped to watch it in the spring. The ghostbuster squad is back in action again.😮😮😁😁😁
Lets goo!!!!!!!
Very excited for this! Happy that they are finally moving past all of the last film's nostalgia overload!
The winter drip lookin 🔥
AMAZING! <3
HUGE W
Bustin makes me feel good! The red jumpsuits have a Real Ghostbusters vibe to it 🙂
I can't believe we got a new villain that isn't Gozer or Vigo! It's not even from the Cartoon & I LOVE IT!!
I already have a theory about who's behind this.
Yesssss
Eh I don't know it doesn't really look that good and patton oswalt and kumail nanjiani are pretty insufferable.
I was nervous about this, but then again I was the same about Afterlife, and it was amazing. Let's forking go!
I actually thought that this was going to be called the new ice age but frozen empire sounds epic
Okay, hab bock auf dieses Sequel! ❤
IDULNAS???
BRING. IT. ON! I am so ready for this. 💪🏼💪🏼
It brings a tear to my eye and warmth in my heart to see the OG Ghostbusters, specifically Zeddemore and Venkman still suited up all of these long years later. Also seeing Paul Rudd as an official Ghostbuster is just awesome! Can't wait for this film!!
It's busting time❤
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Omg yes yes yes
Ghostbusters 4: Frozen Empire
Look so cool and finally a new enemy!!!!
IM SO HYPE
YEAAAHH FINALLY FINN HOW GHOSTBUSTER!
OMG this looks cool as hell, I can't wait!!!
What is the song at the beginning?
Who invited the snow king’s evil brother? Or jack frost’s evil father?
I . . . Just yes I'm ready for this!
I love this trailer, I'm excited to have viewed it!
Right now I love it
Hell is literally freezing over…. Who you gonna call?
What an abomination
Things are about to get chilly
SHUT UP AND TAKE ALL MY MONEY!
Looks awesome. I can't wait. Definitely taking my kids to see this
Go get them ghosts Spider-Man
I have a bad feeling Venkman is going to die early on.
Looks amazing!!
I need to change my pants....this looks AWESOME
Ooooooooooh yeessssss!!!!
I am so glad we are doing something new with GB after so many years. I cannot wait to see this.
SO EXCITED!!
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
OMG looks AMAZING!
I'm all in on this. It looks great!
Ecto automatically earns a like.  Surprised to not see Ecto 2 with this being a weather issue.
1:41 Finn's Face😂😂😂
LET's GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
The ice being is so cool
Damnnn 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Omg yes!!!

Can’t wait
Now this looks decent!
We WILL gonna call  That didn’t work
1:51 who’s that
Oh yeah!!!!
I saw it in a singular frame, but I need that Ghostbusters jacket.
So rudd and the kids are the new ghostbusters going forward.....umm ok.
Holly s..t!!!
Lets goooooo!!!!
This is it! THIS IS DEFINITELY IT!
ok that gave me chills! ha see what i did there
WE ARE SO BACK
YAY!!
Finally, a movie I actually want to see
wait, so the video game IS CANON!?!?!? (this has to do with a spot in the library level where there was a snowstorm in the library maze)
CAN'T WAIT!!!!!
Ultimate!!!!!! Ghostbusters!!!!!!!!! I can’t!!!! Wait!!!,
Man!!! I want more!!! More!!!!!
About time Paul Rudd put on the Pack.
🤘🏾🤘🏾
Looks okay
Oh good it's an actual movie that's not just nostalgia bait but an actual new threat and storyline. I actually thought for a second this was another crappy VR or mobile game since I kept getting blue-balled by that in this channel.
This generally brings a tear to my eye 🥲
Winter is coming... Literally  Awesome trailer!👍🥶
I ain't afraid of no ghost
Awesome 😎 I hope another trailer comes soon and gives us the name of the big bad ghost freezing New York I hope that it could be Vigo and he is doing this as his back up plan to walk among us again
OH YEAH!! 🙌
That's Cold!
YES!!!!!!!!!! 👏👏👏👏
Here before 10k views
I think I just slimed my underwear! Awesome!
That looks pretty cold
Hell yeah!!!
Heat
This looks amazing!
Feels like its the 80s again
Feels legit! Ghostbusters are back, baby! WHO YA GONNA CALL!?
looks nice a different story instead of a soft reboot, cool
I love Afterlife but I do love the fact that they are relying less on nostalgia and more on something original.
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Title is.... meeeeh
Looks great I can’t wait
im excited but im nervous.  Dan has a way of being right and hinting at things that are going to happen.  Something tells me that one of the guys ain't making it this time. God I hope i'm wrong.
Definitely seeing this in IMAX!🤩🎞️🍿 Can’t wait to see another winter themed movie in IMAX! ❄️ I remember seeing The Polar Express at an IMAX Dome!🤩
Really miss Harold Ramis' input and wisdom regarding the story beats/script direction
Holy Cow!
Go Finn Wolfhard ❤❤❤
Oh hell yeah.
So excited to see Ghostbusters back in NYC!
Can't wait 😁 & my man Patton always happy to see him in things
Love this trailer and yes is about time we get the Ghostbusters around this modern days New York City Amen.
Those effects need some work... Pay whatever you have to to fix them and give the VFX team time.
Is it a Movie
1:53 Exactly my reaction !
Goosebumps! I was waiting and hoping for a continuation and finally the long-awaited trailer is here! I love Ghostbusters and would love to run to the cinema! 😍

I am … this is great. This is just flipping great. AHHH!🤩
BEAUTIFUL
OMG! It’s getting frosty around here!❤🎉
Didn't Daniel Larusso's mom sell the firehouse to the Ghostbusters before the two moved to Fresno?
Wow, that looks phenomenal… exactly what I wanted, ghostbusters back in New York!
Extreme climate change.
