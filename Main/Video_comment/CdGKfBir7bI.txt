What's up with Glendale? Context for the non US citizens
0:48 why is he pink 😭
The citadel runs on canon and canon sucks.  I'm with Rick.  From the first 2 seasons.
Jessica would fall head over heels for 26 year old Morty.
1:47 "hey remember when we didnt care about making a decently written story? gee i hate that our fans want us to make a good story..."
Everytime i watch rick and morty i remember im programmed and i am Morty but with Ricks knowledge, i guess im evil Morty...
1:02 For a very brief moment here, there's 2 versions of Morty prime. They're both part of the original because Morty was split into 3 slices and merged together. He was not cloned or copied. The 26 year old Morty is also the original because that was the age they removed. 26 year old Morty is the physical result of them removing his old age. He is a physical embodiment of 26 years of his life. He is the same person as the 14 year old Morty. The 14 year old Morty is just the Morty that the show continues following.
“Oof you’re going to get suspended with pay”, “cmon Morty, let’s get out of here before this gets political”
T5 EP 10
🧑‍🤝‍🧑
You're about to get suspended with pay 😂
Teenager Morty is 4'11 to 5'0 because in Morty's Mind Blowers he was shorter than the 5'3 passenger dude with glasses by about 3 to 4 inches. Adult Morty has been scene multiple times including in this scene here and going off Rick's height of 6'4 and Morty's height fo 4'11/5'0, Adult Morty is roughly 5'6 or 5'7, which adds up when you consider he stands at around Summer's height of 5'6
Wich ep is this from?
Bring back Justin please!
26 year old Morty left Jessica on read
Seeing 26 year old morty is just a reminder that he's been 14 for like, 10 years
tight.
“Something unfair is happening.” And then he is off ☠️ “was I influential?” 😂
0:22 In the bottom right corner, theres a Rick looking sad and his Morty also looking sad and has a long beard. Huh, is the beard like irreversible or something?
The Rick and Morty universe is amazing
What was the troglodyte morty?
1:24 “wuff your about to get suspended with pay”😂
Morty has a dr zoidberg syndrome from futurama
“they made it glendale” love the community references
Thumbnail: morty before and after.
Did you know that regrowing skin is pink 0:45
I would NEVER wanna go through a process like that
26 year old Morty was definitely clapping Jessica
his 30s must've been rough
Couldn't Rick have just killed Morty and used operation Phoenix to put Morty in a cloned/young body instead of going to the Citidel again?
Evil morty🧏‍♂️🤫
I've lived in Glendale and still go out there to eat at Porto's, and I still don't get the Glendale joke.
“You’re about be suspended with pay” 😂😂😂
The Re-Build-A-Morty is how I imagine futuristic sci-fi sex-swap machines are like, and hopefully will be. - Optional DNA customisation before process - Take samples of every cell type and the respective DNA from your body. - Swap chromosomes - Accelerate growth appropriately - Store/Dispose previous DNA-chromosome set    - For reversal/cloning/etc. purposes
I'm just happy Morty gets a neck in his 20s.
Morty ... Forty  Got it
i don't remember this episode. what season is it?
This show's stupid
Clothes.
I think ive seen rebuild a morty in the previous seasons am i tripping?
Splitting an old Morty into 2 young Morties is leet!
Millenial morty doesnt exist
Why is baby morty kinda adorable
RickC-137:1:25 Woof Your About To Get Suspended With Pay!
1:18 They should've listened to him
RIP Rick and Morty december 11 2022. Let it go
Best diet ever
Well, Morty didn't age as gracefully as his father.
[AS]
Can a clone feel? Could a CLONE HAVE A SOUL?!?!?
You think deep down Rick is upset he won't be around to see Morty grow up?
Most viewers will never visit Glendale. So they won’t appreciate how incredible that joke is.  Glendale is like a suburb city of LA.  It’s in the valley , on the far side of Burbank. People driving to Pasadena..pass thru Glendale and never stop there. It has a mall, and a downtown “city” like area. Everyone there is either Chinese or Armenian.  No one in LA goes there. I’ve known people who grew up in LA, and they don’t even know how to get there.  It’s not a slum or a dump… but there is like no reason to go there. It’s just “meh”.
"Hey! The-they shot me!" That’s kinda cute ngl.
"They made it Glendale." Does anyone outside of LA understand that joke?
"Tight" still gets me going 😂
I want that rebuild tech like now.
Is it weird im kinda into 26 year old morty, I think its the hair, I love poofy hair.
So this how loki get some of it variant ideas 😂😂😂
Episode?
Anyone knows the song
Sell Out Morty is canon as of the season 7 finale!
When Morty couldn’t get any more “Mortier”.
I like build a morty Morty. Really nonchalant. Sad he probably died
butt far-
“You’re about to be suspended with pay.”  Well the goblin Morty was carrying a loaded weapon and aimed it at them. Seems like he was fully in the right to take him out.
1:03 That Morty looks like James A Janisse from Dead Meat
this is gettin too meta lol
Imagine a 26 year old evil morty 💀
Bro looks like he's in his 50's not 40
is there "Re-Build-A-Rick"?
0:42 When did Morty find girls gross?
season 5 episode 10
Gotta love how now with the seventh season you can very obviously tell Roiland is spinning his wheels and refusing to do anything canon borderline out of a “refusal of the call”
Alternate title: Making a forty morty shorty
I really wish they didn’t break the fourth wall as much when it’s such a plot focused episode.  Like it’s like they don’t want us to take the events seriously, while still portraying the events as serious. Idk
Proof that hair and height makes you attractive
I like the concept of the citadel "weve bred too many Morties, lets just let em run the place. Im sure 14 year olds can properly operate a society and keep it function in as many facets of possible"
He could get 2 mortys aged 14 and one aged 12
morty cop: *shoots someone* "oof, you're about to get suspended with pay"  and this ladies and gentlemen, is *AMERICA*
"The second he admits hes evil, we're gone!"  Up Next: Evil Morty Invites Rick and Morty to Dinner
As a 26 year old, sometimes I wake up wondering if I'm not just the disembodied undesired half of a 14 year old me that was trapped in a 40 year old shell.
I'm kinda surprised Rick just didn't fix Morty by himself.
That's a rough 40 for Morty.
…so, if you aged up morty to, say, 28, then split him with the machine, you’d have two 14-year-old mortys, right?  Isn’t it feasible to make infinite mortys from this? Infinite anyones, for that matter?
I like how they couldn’t just have a device to de-age Morty. Like they couldn’t just have the chamber reverse his physical age they had to make the process incredibly painful.  Also wow Morty looks good at 26.
“Even pooping hurts, now” 😆😂🤣
Man did Morty take a downward spiral from 26 to 40.
The one thing that REALLY annoyed me about this show is that they mention Atlantis' existence as canonical fact and then never show it. i don't wanna see an episode where they just sort of mention Atlantis, I wanna see an episode that's set IN Atlantis and is to do with that stuff. But no fruitcake Mr. Nimbus.
I like to think that machine is making use of a temporal vacuum
1:20 the crazy deformed morty is one of the forced workers and was actually telling the truth about the citadel being a weapon
As someone in my 40s can I sign up for the service
Jesus loves
Hey I got a good title for one episode how about "it's so Morty it's
Got programmed?
at 1:07 same bro
What episode was this from?
Why the heck did i just notice morty’s nose and ears
why did the regular morty have pink skin but the 26 year old morty has regular skin
I knew that 26 year old Morty was going to die but I didn't think immediately. I thought he was just going to be a funny side character for the episode that gets killed off in the end.
Next season won't be good
When forty-morty cutter on half later why he got a sunburn
I think one of Mortys had a sunburn
26 yo Morty has a trendy V-neck t-shirt with shorter sleeves 😂
It's been confusing to me how Morty at his 40's looks like man who drank beer whole like, but 26 y.o Morty looks like athlet
Wait does this mean that morty’s lifespan has been cut by 26 years?
Those 5 seconds of getting every bone broken, sliced in half, and getting fused together with another you must've been beyond hell in those moments 😂
What's the song?
I love how morty sounds EXACTLY the same no matter how old he is
0:42 Saint-14's brain in a nutshell
I love how morty’s adult voice haven’t changed yet because of his same voice as the normal morty
"The Citadel runs on canon" Amazing line.
1:02 youtubers when they reach 100k subscribers
Comandante 💪💪💪🇱🇷
"the second he reveals he's evil we're gone" the foreshadow is great with this one
"your about to get suspended with pay"  "let's go before this gets political"  Oh yeah, Rick ain't afraid to go there.
Rick and morty was fun while it lasted. Dude just had to be a wife beater
Episode number and season pleeease?
rick drink green  drugs
" I'm almost ready to sellout " " Something unfair is happening " " Was I influential? Yeah, you were influential, you had like 7 , 7 blogs.  Tight"
Which episode is this?
Lol 😆  26 year old morty 😆😅
Ok what ep is this ? I thought I've watched it all
man i love how casually rick breaks the fourth wall
“girls are gross” lmao
That was good!! 26y Morty is a chad, happy for him, he's also a righteous dumb which is wholesome.
"They made it nicer." / "They made it Glendale."  Now I imagine SB LVII being populated by Ricks and Mortys.
What episode is this
26yo morty looks like a hunk of a man🤝👍
Spoken like a true adult Morty. I'm 40 and pooping hurts. Lol
I'm 24, when 26yo morty said "I'm almost ready to sell out" my soul left my body
This was so me at 26 😂😂😂
If he becomes 2 sentient beings and then is smushed back to one how to you the old one of him is really the same I dunno it's just weird
According to the math morty is 26 and a half bruh
Randy It should've been Randy
"You are seriously hurting the citadel experience" 💀
Smartest man in the universe asking a question about Morty's skin colour 😳😳
That line at 1:24 says a lot
シュールだわ～
"Wow you're about to get suspended with pay" is very real and quite sad actually
Why don’t I remember this episode
There were a lot of missed opportunities with 26-year old Morty that the writers could've capitalized on in later seasons. They could've brought him back with main Rick and Morty then make him part of the Smith household, which would've created a fascinating dynamic with 26-year old Morty being the only one in the family without any evident psychological damage. Heck, they could even have made an interesting love triangle with him, main Morty, and Jessica, with Jessica finding him cool and hot, much to main Morty's jealousy, while 26-year old Morty's not so keen on it and tries pushing her to give main Morty a chance.
What does "You had like 7 blogs" even mean?
What's that supposed to mean "they made it Glendale"?
What episode?
Adult morty height looks like  5.5
Episódio ⁉️ Temporada ⁉️
I like crayons-girls are gross 😆😂
i fully understand evil morty
Looking back at this scene now with the informatiom that gremlin morty was right changes how it's veiwed entirely
Music at the beginning? Its the same Music rick hears in his car after throwing them to the crow planet.
U.S. Marines be like 0:42
I see prime rea beating c137 rick, then evil morty pops and kills prime rick. Evil Morty isn't evil per se, he is actually a morty that made sense
First
"We were supposed to go back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on canon" lmao
I’ve lived in AZ for a year and that Glendale joke was funny as hell
Why no one is talking about the arm tattoo which 40 and 26 years old Mortys have? I mean, when he did that? What is it mean for him? I want answers.
The thing I love about this is that Rick knows literally nothing about the Morty president and just assumes he's evil because that would be the thing for an ongoing story to do.
- "Let me help you. This is not a good look." *BANG* - "Oh Boy." - "Hey! The-they shot me!"  I always laugh so hard at this 💀
This is late, but to be honest, evil morty could have improve things in the citadel but in the end he chose to escape rather than take that opportunity to make things better
I love the fact that the middle part of Morty just sounds like a balloon when it is untied XD
what episode is this? why cant they write the episode # in the description????
Thus is like a kidfancade but the thing it was real.
What's the lobby music called?  Ist really sick
Jesus loves all of you
Is it more costly to rebuild a 26 YO morty than to dispose of human remains in outter space?
ngl, I was sad Young Adult Morty died 😢
Man it was weird that this bit felt like it was going somewhere and then its just a throwaway joke that wasnt even super good
hghghhghgh
Even pooping hurts now
Morty forty
Something unfair is happening lol
"I like crayons," "Girls are gross," literally me and I'm older than that
I bet there is something fishy about morty's tattoo.
It would have been funnier if the mascot was named AmpersAndy.
Wow Puberty is gonna hit morty like a sack of bricks. I also noticed that he has a light streak in his hair just like young Rick did
As someone who is 27, it pains me to see how accurate 26yo morty is
I really think they could have had more creative rick and morty designs for the ones in the citadel
im 26 and im too almost ready to sell out
1:20 - he revealed the whole evil morty plan
from what episode is this ?
At least we know morty will be cool in he’s 21
Lel
Morty: you had like Seven blogs  26 yr old morty: tight
"I like crayons!" "Girls are gross!" sends me 😭
26yo Morty is HAF
The idea was to return to simple adventures, the citadel runs on cannon 😂
Young Morty: Be thankful you had a good life. Adult Morty: I was just born. Young Morty: I said good, not long.
Morty milenial
Sims 2 Morty
The fact how tv is programmed to keep us distracted and how certain shows reveals sh** that can happen 10 years from now is crazy, yall don’t realize that
I wanna be a morty ima change my avatar
I like how 40 year old Morty still sounds like a teenager
I just realized that when 26 year old morty was talking after he was shot, you could hear him gargling on his own blood. That's really good attention to detail. Although, this IS rick and morty, so that's not really saying much
Are we not gonna talk about how that Morty that got shot was spoiling the rest of the episode?
Anyone notice how 20 year old morty looks similar to younger Rick?
This ain’t Build-a-Morty
I swear that tattoo of Morty are Ellis' tattoo from left 4 dead 2
What season and episode is this from?
one boy... can change your life.
Something I've never thought of till now is the repercussion that this device is basically eternal youth. Get too old? About to pass on? Just split your age until you're younger again and dispose of what is left
The  Glendale joke was probably a joke to Dan Harmon's show Community 😂
I love how 40 year old Morty is literally just Rick.
is andy a rick or morty
dam 20s morty is vey vey handsome, bet jesscia would fall in love on that type of morty while the original one is the jealous one
I just realized that Morty probably j ust saved their lives by going to that dinner since if Morty probably had already refilled their portal gun at that point, meaning if they had left, they might had gotten killed as well.
Doo
the citadel is a weapon of mass destruction (wormageddon)
Which episode is this ?
is this from an episode?
Your telling me this kid is 14 and deals with that- I never tho about his age-
Jeez seven blogs that's so tight
"ricks &'y morty"
1:25 "Woof, you're about to get suspended with pay." Love that blue line reference.
Bruh rick knew president morty was evil and didnt even try to do anything to get away from him beforehand
The citadel works on canon. I love that line.
the old thin morty look like doctor who david tennant
Baby mouse
There's no way a 40 y. o. looked that way in real life! He's like is over his 50s, at least!
That song in the beginning was kinda a groove tho
1:46 "The Citadel runs on Canon" LOL
What happened between 26 year old Morty and 40 year old Morty. He was looking top of the world at 26.   Let that be a lesson: take care of yourself in your mid 20s.
Rick should have shoved hia
"Woof, you're about to get suspended with pay." That shouldn't be funny but I still laughed.
For anyone wondering this is the final episode of season 5
Bruhh Old morty looks like the manager from viva la dirt HAHAHAJAHHAHA
"Was I influential?" "Yeah dude, you had like, 7 blogs." "Tight." *dies*
Good to know that Morty's voice won't be changing as he ages. And it seems his voice was the same ever since.
You'd expect morty to listen for once
Lol the citadel runs on cannon
I am probably reading too into this, but re-built morty is pink like the picture of Good Morty on the prophecy pamphlets in Close Rick-counters of the Rick-kind ok yes that’s dumb nevermind
Rick and Morty clones himself.
“No escape no escape!”
"tight"
ひでぇ　可哀想ぉ
"You're about to get suspended with pay"  😅😅 why did you have to be so accurate rick
RIP 26 year old Morty 😢 He was so influential
Lol 😝
Thumbs too hard
God he keeps commiting suicide.   Y
I liked this episode because I'm like 40 too
“you had…7..7 blogs”  “tight”
Its a reference to the Pocket Morty
"Morty we're supposed to go back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on Canon" Love the implication between funny episodes that slight affect the story vs episodes that work in the final plot. Really love that comment
“I like crayons” “Girls are gross”
Caramba nunca percebi porque acalma
A D  B C  a  h b a
So that crazy Morty knew. Mad to think if he hadn’t been shot, this may have ended up completely different
“The Citadel runs on Canon.”
As someone who is nearing 40 with a receding hairline and a big gut this hits home.
Morty lives matter
"You know I destroyed this place" *And founded*
26 year old Morty looks good.
the twenty-years-old Morty that ask if he was influential, is one of the most delicious cynical satires of this cartoon! 1:02
I liked 26 yo Morty
What episode is this
“Let me help you; this is not a good look”   Last words of a King.    F
Morty 26 = Morty with neck
Can someone please explains to me something: if the ricks decided to separate the infinite number of universe where the ricks are the smartest from the infinite number of universe where he's not the smartest, how is this evil morty situated in the first half where the ricks are the smartest is smarter than his rick (we've seen previously how he controlled him). There is a contradiction, and if someone have a theory please state it.
I don't like what they did with Morty. Five seasons of screen time, countless experiences and life lessons, as well as a ton of character development, only to turn him into... Jerry.
“They made it Glendale.”
ngl Morty actually looks pretty handsome in his 20s
This show fell off ngl  :(
26 year old morty is gonna make me act up 😳
I’m 25 now, if I die at 26 I want my final word to be “tight”.
"You're about yo get suspended with pay" LMAO And dares to say to leave BEFORE it gets political
26 year old morty was actually kinda cool
"Uh-oh something unfair is happening" Lmao
Rick and morty
“Is that normal?” “Probably”
The weird Golem looking morty was right
"Whoa, you're about to be suspended with pay." Ooooooof
Ok but can we talk about that Morty just lost 28 years of his life?
now this is the rick n morty i love, less of that gay aquaman and feminist captain planet stuff
Which episode is this?
Something that I love about Rick and morty is seeing all the different Rick and Mortys! (My fav morty is cop morty)
0:42 mortys two personality's would be like though.
Man the writing sucks in this one.
“Morty, The idea was going back to simple adventures, The citadel runs on cannon”   XD
This episodes is for sure one of my favourites. I've rewatched it like 30 times since it came out. Can't wait for season 6!
Weird i barely remember this
What episode is this?
"Im almost ready to sell out!"
Hmmm if I could shave off 14 years...
"Thr citadel runs on canon" is a crazy Abed line. The writers know everything they do right then is officially canon...so they immediately lampshade that and then spit in it with a 4th wall break that screws with canon.  Not subtle at all.
The new seasons are definitely not as good as the earlier ones but the show is still enjoyable to watch. There's a lot I don't like about the new episodes but what made the show what I like is still here and I always enjoy coming back and re-watching stuff. It could be better but, that's okay.
Can’t believe they’re making a 6th season im so excited to see morty being a Rick…
You would think the 26 year old Morty would have the Tattoo just for his blog?
If they left without going for the dinner, would they have just immediately died there and then?
Split the diff was taken so literally here.
"the idea was to get back to simple adventures, The Citadel runs on Canon."
I mean, that 26 year old Morty wasn't just some throw away copy, it was actually Morty. Heck it was probably more Morty than the 14 year old version since it was made up of more years.
“The citadel runs on canon”  This is one of the funniest lines I have ever heard and I have no idea why
"Morty, the idea was to go back to *simple* adventures. The Citadel runs on Canon." Rick, are you implying that some episodes of the show, aren't canon to the show?
Which episode was this again?
“Let me help you, this is not a good look!”
"S-Something unfair is happening".
The Glendale comparison was very subtitle but funny...
I can't tell if the 26 year old Morty looks like a typical Hot dude or a Balding old man.
I don’t dig the writing
"I'm almost ready to sell out!"  Big Oof
Was this in an episode??
0:38 rick is bald
i saw lizard morty
Ah yes,Morty Forty
"The Citadel runs on canon."  This show breaks down the 4th wall with every episode.
What is the song playing in citadel?
This show got real old real fast.
crazy how many of these comments fail a simple empathy and ethics test. we are truly doomed.
"Your skin's all pink like a baby mouse" is hilarious
I'd Buy that for a Dollar
sounds really violent lmaoo
is this season 5?
"Suspended with pay" lmao
Yeah you had 7 blogz
Who also slowed the playback speed when Morty was being cut in half, just me?
😂
How are Mortys smart to make that and not Rick???
I like crayon Girls are gross
1:22 he doesnt know about the changes good continuity
Do you guys remember when all those talented people worked on this show and it was good?
Man, its really clear how much the writers dont like the audience for wanting a consistent story arch
Running of of canon
MTV feeds taco b.eats award all rights reserved [cc] Jose carbajal vs estate :)
Man! This creepy Morty was literally warning us for the future here!
I hate the evil morty story line and the citadel.  So terrible.
As a 26 year old, I felt that.
Roiland doesn't want to do "story driven" episodes, he wants to do whatever his LSD induced brain wishes to make and Dan tries to steer him in a "correct path", knowing what the fans want but knowing its ultimately justin's choice cause its on him if the show happens at all.
So spitballing here but I'm guessing there are about 26000 designations for Rick's?  Going from A-001 to Z-999 ?
After 5 seasons rick and morty finally has a story line
Love Rick and Morty
When more on netflix ?
Never gonna give you up
"I like crayons" "Girls are gross"
👌🌟🌟
So Rick essentially just wants to run around doing side quests and avoids The Citadel because it advances the story.
Rick and morty
*cop shoots deformed Morty in the head*  “Oof. You’re about to get suspended with pay”  Jesus Christ
"Oof, you're about to get suspended with pay."
“Morty at Forty.” - [as]
They made it Glendale lol
Can you live on a planet that everywhere you see is yourself?
26 year old Morty's hair looks like young Rick's
"you're about to get suspended with pay" that cop joke would have made sense if it wasn't a gun on gun situation, shittiest take maybe ever
Where is this from
"I'm almost ready to sell out" at 26 hit me like a hammer.
The 7 year old Mortys were pretty funny.
0:42    lol
“Re-Build-A-Morty” I never realized it was foreshadowing some revelations later in the episode.
I think rick might be more aware of his wall breaking than deadpool
the end is drawing near
0:13 yes, I am a proud mortysexual, how could you tell?
The rick mafia still got the same cars in the future 🤣
Morty Millenial...the best gag of this episode...
The 26 year old morty died stupid
"Was I influential?" "Yeah you were influential- you had like 7, 7 blogs." "Tight-" *dies*  Lmao 😂
La gente que dice que morty es rick :🤡
26yo Morty is facts: I'm almost ready to sell out.
someone's getting suspended with pay. :-D
The part of this noone noticed? Truth being spoken by those seen as crazy.
Rick Keep's making mor morty's LOL
When will you put season five on HPO and Hulu
Morty is 40. Sheer poetry!
"I like crayons" "Girls are gross" The duality of man
Love how at 26, Morty is "ready to sell out"
0:42 so cute
what season & episode is this?
F
The citadel is a weapon. Mass Effect references are few and far between
I'm almost ready to sell out 😆
What season was this episode? I don't remember it at all
I have just now, because of this clip, learned that there is a 5th season of Rick & Morty with episodes! 🤯
Adult morty like tobey maguire
Wait what spoiler, yeah don't pay for DIRECTV anymore....
What episode is this?
“I like crayons, girls are gross” hilarious
When you think about it…     Justin Roiland actually played every character in this sequence
Sry im from fr..what does it mean to sell out...in french version the dub is made by leftys so 26 years old morty said "old enough to vote right wing "
You had like seven... Seven blogs! *TIGHT*
He looks like jerry
It's honestly cool that the first thing that the Adult Morty did was try to stop the police unfairly attacking another Morty. It shows that even with the way his life's going Morty will always be a better person than Rick, even by a little bit, considering the leftover Morty was implied to be a millenial sellout at age 26
I forgot that this show exists
"they made it Glendale" legit aimed for for Armenian sheep 😂
...And the morty president is the most evil guy in the universe
RIP 26 years
"The citadel runs on canon"
What episode is this?
"was I .... influential?" Every last zoomies final words as they recap their hollow ignorant lives And no,no you weren't. You made up dances ok TikTok...you're a failure
26 yr Morty was spot on 🤣
What episode is this?
I screamed when older Morty said "Something unfair is happening!" 🤣
"You're about to get suspended with pay"  Isnt that the truth.
“Almost ready to sell out”.   As a 26 year old, that hurt.
Did anyone noticed that the thumbnail video animation have an almost perfect loop?
Dying while doing something influential is tight
oh wow, such meta
What ep is this? I've never seen this wth
This is a joey diaz ripoff
1:21 LMAO
What ep?
This show sold out hard.
I’ll take those 26 Years…
Какой эпизод?
Why was his skin so pink?
Citadel is weapon of mass destr...... Was that a Mass Effect reference, or am I the only one
Hello? What universe is this?
I will never forgive Bob Zmeckis for ripping off Rick & Morty to make Back To The Future.
1:03 26 year old Morty looks mysteriously like Barry Taylor from Sorted.
I love how Rick genuinely seemed to consider the new council with ricks and mortys in harmony "Nicer".  Also im surprised no one ever mentions the Morty who is just casually walking around with a portal gun at 0:11  or the sad rick at 0:22
Being 26, pretty accurate
26 year old morty have the same actions when rick was going through a hero phase and similar hair cut, I like the details with these 2 characters. even though they are grandpa and grandson, it's nice to see that Morty hasn't turned into Jerry when he turns 26.
Wow pt 2 of the south park special looks sick!
What eps and season is this if anyone knows ? Thank you.
Wait, is season 5 out?
white folks always grab cop gun but never get shot by white cops vs black men always get shot for raising their hands or drop their guns vs white guy grab the cop gun ....yep its political
Is this the new season?
This was a 100% justified police shooting by their own logic. They couldn't even manufature a police brutality situation without it being justified.
The 26 year old Morty looks like Gauge from the Rittenhouse trial.
Heheheheeh this isnt funny :]
Everytime I see this thumbnail Morty looks like Eminem.
Why is 20 years old morty kinda hot??
Re make a morty is better name
So biologically Morty will never reach 26 Trust me I failed biology
Y’all catch the 27 club reference?
⚠️ Spoiler 1:19
Morty Lives Don't Matter!
I was really hoping for a better end to this story.
1:14 не знал что Рик казах
Definitely Glendale.
Ah yes. Typical cop Friday. Shoot someone in the head. Suspension with pay. If you look up the punishment for officers who kill civilians you'll get a boat load of google fun. Go try it
this is actually the story of my life at 26. alter ego
“Oof, you’re about to get suspended with pay”😂😂😂😂
so sigma
What episode is this??
Im so bummed that I am basically 95% of the way to being “old morty”. Except I have no rick to save me.
Wait—What season & episode is this???? How could I miss this one??
I like it how the 3-second preview of the thumbnail is almost looping
This is fake. I see all. But this is never happen. Report this. Fake channel
i just need more rick and morty in my life
If there are infinite ricks there are infinite ricks who are the original rick and rick is just an average rick in a rick ricking ricking rick rick rick ricked rickked.
Citadel built back better
This ain't Re-Build-A-Morty (a Morty) you don't get to pick and choose
Even in English sounds very funny.
That music at the start sounds like a crappy techno beat version of "Baby Come Back"
was I.... influential?
.....

" alrite, whats disposal cost? "xD
which season is this?
THEY TURNED IT INTO GREENDALE!?!?  🤣🤣🤣
Until he becane a mod
Ya, nah. Go back in time, don't f your OG fanbase, and burp more.  Just fix it. JK you can't. But I mean the goal was to sell out so yay you did it!
When i saw this moment. I was like, "oh we're jumping right into it"
I hate to say it but millennial Morty reaaaally reminds me of the survivor paramedic from the rittenhouse trial
Personally, I would have done the thing with the  other Morty, so that there’s 2 on my team, then raise the leftover years
cool
i love how rick just predicted the season five finale in one sentence
They made i Glendale   Is that reference to Dan harmons community college
What season and episode is this clip from?
When italian traduction?
Version of Morty from Eric Clapton universe
This gives split the diff a whole new visual. 😂
Shouldn't Morty lose part of his memory for being sliced into 3 pieces and having like a third of that permanently dying?
Rick old fake 70.
Хоть мне и нравится рик и мотри, но это видео в рекомендыция доебало меня уже!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! На кой хер мне это каждый раз суют!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?
Adult swim sucks. Communist forced out everyone that made it cool.
Dan Harmon is a severely sick individual, you really should think twice before watching this production of his. You are after all, supporting his cause.
probably marriage turned morty to that adult form.
"I'm almost ready to sell out"   This show knows how to gut punch you some times.
I always confuse futurama with this
متى هذا الموسم ينعرض ؟
That Morty in 1:03 looks pretty attractive
After Morty says there's a Morty president Rick says "they made it nice". Morty is annoyed "they made it Glendale".  But then Morty is excited to see the Morty president and Rick doesn't want to and wants to bail the whole place.  Their feelings totally reverse in an odd manner. I don't think it was 26yo Morty dying the change their view like that. Just noticed.
"I like turtles."  No, wait...
People who are not involved in situations shouldn't just assume they're unfair at first glance and throw themselves into them.
atleast we know morty down bad when he older.
cring
What season is this from?
so between now and at the age of 26 he gets that arm tattoo.
Hope it comes Netflix in this year
Why is 26-year-old morty slightly attractive??
from which season this scene is from?
shoutout anyone who knows what glendale is
what video is the next one
FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY...  .. this show must never end.
Tight
I actually dislike how characters do not change in adult swim shows. They had already showed two Christmas in Rick and Morty so Morty should have been at least 15 now. I will not even mention the amount of dates Morty had already for a 14 year old kid which makes it weird since he does not grow up.
Ayyyy there's a Morty Rick
t i g h T.
"Th-thaht sounds Really violent "   Had me dyin
The secret service ricks look cool
dent coin doge coin rise up to rich🤑🤑🤑🚀🚀🚀🙂🙂🙂
ก
What does he mean by I'm almost ready to sell out?
Aw jeez rick i- I'm forty, I'm forty morty rick  It's ok morty, it's ok
Was I influential?!
Ep
so when is season 5 coming out
I gotta say that almost adult Morty was prrtty handsome
This ain’t build a mort….. You don’t get to pick and choose.
I also like crayons.
I like this show but this fan base is fcking insufferable.
>I'm almost ready to sellout how do they always manage to strike that one nerve so precisely and succinctly
These are some of the best 2 minutes the show has ever produced. So many good jokes, 26-years-old Morty killed me. Nailed Generation Z in 30 seconds.
1:49 haha more meta humor LAUGH
Me when sewer morty comes out of the sewers in the back: B R U H
This show sux
What episode is this from? edit: found it episode 10 season 5.
I thought that  he was actually 40 years old and living a horrible life. Morty tricked me good.
I love the mass effect references
The citadel is a weapon of mass- Dies* We all know what he was gonna say
1:13 pixel gun 3d shotgun sound
Was the Morty on the left supposed to look like Homer or just a happy accident.
E
1:25 What a cringey take. That morty had a gun and was going to kill ppl. bruh
Rick and morty forever please. 1000th seasons.
Did NO ONE get the mass effect reference?
In 7 years we’ll have another season of Rick and Morty
Aw shit I'm almost 22, which means I only have four years left of not being stupid
Morty lame asf
Put it on Hulu already lol
Lab coat morty is another morty that doesn't stutter
The only good Morty..
Wtf is up with Rick's voice
"suspended with pay"
Best episode
Lol
Wait a minute, how come 14 year old Morty had pink skin from the process but 26 year old Morty didn't?
Something really hit different when 26 year old Morty says he’s almost ready to sell out - I say that as a 26 year old
“You’re about to get suspended with pay”
I’m 46, I don’t look like that 🤣🔥🥃  Or do I ❓❤️‍🔥
I really hope I don’t look like that when I’m 40
I mean the guy was pointing a gun at him I think the Morty cop was justified in killing him
I kinda wish Re-Build-A-Morty was a real store.
I like how the political part was a perfect mirror of politics where someone with a gun that's attacking others is considered innocent but it's somehow awful when the cop puts the criminal down before he can do anymore damage to anyone
“I like crayons” “Girls are gross” Man has his priorities straight
When are Spanish subtitles modernized and enabled?
Almost ready to sell out !
Adult morty looks like bad end adult timmy turner
This show lame af
The only Morty that has a neck
"Was I  fluential"🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:26 "If he was a rick he wouldn't have been shot," there's your political lol
Why puttingan add on 2minute clip shit heads
Ep?
I'm 26 and that was harmfully accurate
Morty just a kid and Rick realizes that.
ayo new morty
what episode is this?
26y Morty: "I'm almost ready to sell out." Me, 27y: "I feel attacked."
Evil Morty s5 lets gooo
How are all of th Morty's in the Citadel the exact same age?
Where can i watch the new seasons
Honestly Rick and mortys best episode yet
See how replaceable they think we are? We're like products to them.
The dying morty gobblin blood while saying "influential" was super realistic
bru
where can i watch this free?
Nobody gonna talk about that morty looks like sypherpk lol
Where do we even find season 5
"Citadels new mascot" "I like crayons" 😂😂😂😂🦍🚀
What episode is this?
Either Rick is really tall or Morty's growth super-stunted.
Ok but why is 26 Morty kind of a snacc
Where can I watch all seasons of rick and morty?
Netflix 4 seasons ...just....
This show is weird af. Whoever watches this shit has issues.
The heck, what episode is this?? 🟡
26 yo morty would’ve been cool to see throughout an episode, like clone Beth (original Beth)
Anyone else notice the licc in that BGM in the beginning?
Y’know 26yr old morty actually looks pretty good
You guys know the Rick the k kids Rick's family is "evil" Morty
What if the 26 years that was removed shortened Morty's lifespan?
"they made it Glendale"  are they referring to glendale in southern California ?
Too bad Rick and Morty jumped the shark. That's what happens when someone with no imagination takes over the show.
When are they going to release more shitty episodes 😒
this show is interesting
Put this shot on Hulu
Morty in his middle aged looks not that really good when he was in his 40s
"Even pooping hurts now" i lost it
Jack Stauber morty be like
Is it just me or does 26 year old Morty look pretty hot?
Was the entire process of that machine inspired by The Cell?
He say girls are gross
“Im almost ready to sell out”
"You knew?!" "The guys name is "Evil Morty"
Also subtle jab that the theorists are mortys
God the writing of this show is phenomenal.
Hello
YAAAY SUICIDE BY COP
Build a b*tch +Rick and Morty = Build a morty
Kiedy polski dubbing?
When it comes to canonical stuff, I think of puzzle progress games. ‘Let’s introduce this’, now let’s make sure it’s there’s at least 0-90 percent of the time… then another plot device, plus another plot device, until some don’t make it back in, and others shine through until the end.
everybody in their 20 always seeks attention because that is the mating age starts
these motherfuckers know the 18-35 male demographic waaaaaaaay too well
Waw
“Fine But the second he reveals he’s evil, we’re gone”.
I feel like this was the last season
*this aint build a bitch (oh bitch)*
"But the second he reveals he's evil, we're gone." My man has it already figured out.
What episode is this
What's the Andy Morty joke?
WHAT IS HIS TATTOO OF
26 yr old Morty looks like Aaron Doughty
Mans looks like thom yorke in the thumbnail
Season five Rick and Morty on Netflix please?
We soo need this cartoon for the next 400 years
"I'm almost ready to sell out."  As a 26 year old, I'm here to confirm the truth of this statement.
Low-key, 26 yo Morty is a pretty good looking guy.
I hate jerry so much
"The Citadel runs on canon."
Man this episode and entire series really was a massive flop. Time to retire it. Series 1 and 2 will never be topped
I don’t understand. What season is this? I’ve never seen it before.
The Rick that makes Simple Ricks was taken from outside of the curve . They even talk about the curve in the commercial for the cookies and it flew over our heads lol
"Alright what's disposal cost?"
"Is that normal?" "Probably."
"adult" swim literally lol
When is this getting to netflix?!
Finally. A decent episode.
What episode is this?
Soyboys wet dream
Rick: this place runs on canon. Me: tf is even considered canon?
So what happenend for Morty to become like that?
rofl. The writers are pretty creative. Must as been high af when they came up with this sort of thing. A group of people sitting chuckling at each others ideas in a smoke filled room.
what eps is this
They don’t want you to think: RICK IS MORTY! So the & joke is to subliminally confirm
This is amazing
Im the morty on the left :(
All i saw was GME
chad morty?
26 year old Morty is one good looking dude!
Nikocado avocado
Yo, anyone know what the song/tune playing over the citadel at the beginning is? Heard it in other movies and tv shows but never able to get the name of it
this is crazy its literally showing you 5g you dont need to rebuild yourself you just need to work on the you that you got.
Only people who live in Los Angeles will get the Glendale joke
Does anyone know the kind of music is played at the beginning? The chill retro futuristic city kind of vibe. Would love to find actual tracks of that style (not synthwave).
Hello, what do you call this kind of character? The kind of handsome kid, courageous and selfless, too naive who wants to make the world a better place through good deeds?
Cooool 😍👍
Is this a clip or a fragment from full episode?
what episode is this
I love very much Rick and Morty i still watch
You can tell he has twitter
How is he still 14 didn't they have Christmas season one and Thanksgiving season 5. Something fishy.
Noooo cool Morty died!
Estos mortys ya estan en pocket morti's? :) saludos desde caborca sonora mexico
We Millennials are no longer obsessed with being “influential”.
Yo so where exactly did evil morty come from? What happened to his rick and how did evil morty become so smart? These are the questions people they didnt answer any of them :((
“Alright, what’s disposal cost?” 😆
Dope that Rick already knows there was an evil morty
0:59 like how they have something going on in the background while theirs a conversation going on in the foreground :)
Man, this season really sucked.
do u guys still watch this show
I saw the thumbnail and I just had to come in here to say that 26-year old Morty looks like Barry from SORTEDFood
Unpopular opinion: I think this should be the final season of R&M. It's a masterpiece as is, there's not much this show can add to itself.
I just realized, Morty was literally older than even his parents
A
I'm sorry but the "I like crayons!" "Girls are gross..!" part had me, just comes to show my humor hasn't fully matured. I'm glad it didn't mature.
When will it come to Netflix
His only relief is that the splits were not aimed at his balls otherwise it would been painfull as fuck
i bet morty went to the citadel trying to get a new rick before aging himself
this aint build a morty A MORTYY
26 year old morty reminds me of how they portray adult lisa in the simpsons.
Adult morty has a neck
This was the only episode that didn't try to hard to be Rick and Morty
Which episode is this?
👀🙏🏻🇧🇷🇧🇷
“something unfair is happening!” lol
I kinda liked 26 yrs old morty, he looked like a nice guy
This is by far my favorite episode
Its really fun to watch it gives me that existencional crisis feeling :)
lmao I love how they talk tv terms. 'we're supposed to be going back to simple adventures, the citadel runs on canon'. lmao
Jesus Loves all of you guys <3
Best episode
Damn
so his 26th real old he was a loser SJW?
Is really nobody going to mention the mass effect part?
To be fair I’m 26 and pooping hurts every now and then but after it’s one of the most satisfying feeling, I call it…post dump clarity
0:42  what??
They say build a morty-y  beta cuck, simp attitude
First really good episode of this season!
WhWhatappened to cop rick?
What season and episode is this?
Soo morty in twenties is sjw? Obbiously
The sound made me remember ankha
How do I watch season 5 in Germany?
You're about to be suspended with pay nicest rick line
Is there a full episode to this clip
wait the wierd monster morty whas right
I love how they use a Halo shotgun sound
At least he didn't have to pay for the disposal.
1:35
WE WANT 5 SEASON TO TURKEY
LOL Look at him. He's clearly not just 40 years old. More like 50 or 55.
Bruh that sewer Morty really was just out here trying to save people and tell them evil Morty's plans and they put him tf down.
Yooooo is season 5 out!? How did I miss it! 🤦🏽‍♂️
Is he supposed to look like that?  Probably
I found Dan schneider and Drake Bell at the same time. They were morty clones all the time Pfft
Hmmm, 26 year old Morty seems like an okay guy.  He leapt in to help some dude even if only for the views.  A hero.
" the second he reveals hes evil were out of here "  even when rick and morty was more quote on quote serialized the show   still didn't take its self too seriously however it knew when to do fourth wall humor and when to take its narrative actually seriously this built emotion and made you care, i dont like this new "4th wall" shit its cringey and lazy.
That older morty was hot
Lol. Made it Glendale.
What is this episode?
That really was tight
I always chuckle when I see Morty's profile 😆
The 26 year morty looks like Jimmy-Steve from shameless lol
when this ep coming out?
Lol the tribal tattoo.
lmao 1:13 how police actually treat people
Seeing how easy it is to de-age an adult Morty, I'd venture to guess Evil Morty is definitely older than 14
Sheesh, they get the sweet spot with 26 year old morty and then stupid creeps in.
Oh Morty to forty that's funny!
Oh man. The Glendale reference is insane
Can i keep the 26 years?
Episode?
I like crayons I don’t like girls
I watched this while I patiently waited at the drive thru.
The citadel runs on canon, lmfao
Boy wehre they wrong - Theoddonesout
As an almost-40 year old I hated this
This is such a story arc. The first time Rick and Morty come to the Citadel in season 1, Rick is annoyed he is there and the first street seller that they see Rick says "Dumb", meanwhile Morty is infatuated by the place. Now this trip Rick is checking the place out while Morty says "Dumb" and wants to move on; rick even saying "aren't you cantankerous", as if he didn't absolutely hate it before . I like the attention to detail.
Lol bright insight
- Was I influential? - Uh, yeah you had like 7 blogs - Tight ☠  This killed me 🤣🤣
Think season 5 is sucks
Hi
I’d care if I could watch the new fucking season 🖕
Calling it now. This was the moment Evil Morty was created
wait, the official channel begs you to subscribe in the end screen. that's pathetic, I guess they delegated it to some poor intern and never checked up
YEEESSSS
The ideal 26 year old male dies as a social justice warrior 😅🤣😂
does anyone else notice how young rick has a different color strip in his hair but morty (29yr) also has the hair strip too
Rip 26 year old morty
What America think of how Trump's rule is: It is now how Joe Mama Biden's laws now:
The Pickle Rick meme introduced me to this show and I just finished binge watching season 4 and 5. I loved every minute of them.  It says a lot that I loved the show much without even seeing the first 3 seasons. Now I need to watch them too.  Directv doesn't have those seasons on demand as far as I can tell though.
lol, as a 26 year old this is hilarious
Same old story Mortys killing Mortys
I like how they actually made it look a lot like build a bear workshop store 🐻 but with a bunch of morty's 😂
Man such insightful escape from my college life and debts humor
Ooof, YOU'RE about to get susPended with Pay.
I liKe 40 year old Morty's tribal tattoo. I mean i don't but it's funny.
The CC is a bit wonky but im glad its there.
Episode?
As a 26 year old I feel attacked
"Woof, someone's about to get suspended with pay. Now let's get out of here before it gets political." XD
Rick and Morty movie soon 😂👍
I can't relate to morthy anymore.   He saw someone died, normally he would be traumatised.  He lost his original character.
age 26 Morty actually dont stutter like the original Morty
look at ricks face 0:04 when andy mascott approach them😂
I’m driving myself crazy trying to figure out that jingle at the start of the video, anyone know where it comes from?
What's Morty's tattoo??
BEST ANIMATED SERIES🇧🇷
a police killing an innocent man:  "woof. You're about to get suspended with pay" INSANE 😂😂😂😂
there just clay figures they can de-age and mold them in seconds mortys really just playthings to rick.
I feel that after season 3 this show went to shit, they had so much potential but they crumbled under their own pressure. They didn't know what they had and just couldn't commit to telling a good story instead the did a lot of shitty episodes and treated their main canon story like a 1 dolar whore. Man this show turned out to be a major dissapointment in my eyes. I know I might be alone in this sentiment but this show had the potential to be a master piece.
Seasons one, two and three were funny, then not so much. What happened?
Morty's voice actor must really tire himself out from voices many versions of him.
*T I G H T*
This is not entertaining, its not neoliberalism, liberalism is new
God I love that Glendale joke. As a natural born Californian, that was pure genius.
I like how 26 year old morty is in shape It really drives home that this is a television show. The average 26 year old I see walking around looks like spaghetti
So hold on. In season 1 Morty was stated to be 14 years old. And not too long ago he said, "I havent been to a full week of school in years." And in this episode they reaffirmed that he still is 14. So what the fuck, is Morty not aging at all? Because there is no way that season 1 - 5 has taken place in under a year
“woof you’re about to get suspended with pay” this show is so damn clever lmao
The season finale was insane. 🙌🏽
Siobhan Thompson is fr the best writee on Rick and Morty
" FORTY MORTY" LMAO
Lol
Rick is Morty
the animation of him ripping apart and getting pieced back together is satisfying idk why
Feel like the beginning towards the Armenians in Glendale. Lol
This is better then the whole last season
This reminds me of Numberblocks.
Ima say it.. Rick and Morty is going down hill. This season has been just blah. Like that Turkey EP was just trash. Most these EP's were just stupid and felt like they were just trying to milk it.
You know we never really do see a lot of mortys who are all grown up What's with that
7 blogs or 7 blocks?
Morty 1: i like crayons Morty 2: girls are gross  Rip, baby Morties last words...
The ONLY adult morty
Tight tight tight
This sucks. Does this give anyone else a headache? No, just me? Maybe my dad?
T O P
I hate how badly they blue balled us with this episode. 💀
26s years Morty is hot
If you look like that at 40...you did something wrong.  Or someone did you wrong.
the process sounds like Taye Brigston origin story
I get pre built mortys
Zx
Naaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ertyyhhhhh
123680
way to spell it out guys...love it
There is a new animal pink, "baby mouse pink."
You know, Morty actually saved Rick by insisting on head to the dinner.
"Was I...influential?"  basically every instagram "influencer" we all know today
damn so like father like son no matter how many times you wanna change and not end up like your dad its just happened
Thx for reppin Turtle house! Free Penny Lane Ippolito from DHS in Fort Collins Colorado! Xxam shop with me. Yt Short 🛸🐢♥️
oh yeahh! you knew ! finally that crack theory of rick=morty, was finally nullified with it!!
2 morty 7 years
0:22 morty raptor
Anybody know when this season is gonna be on Netflix?
Ok but why is 26 year old Morty low key kinda hot though?
I like crayons
I really wanted to see more of the 26-year-old Morty.
Rick talk like he hates canon, and yet it's when they actually follow canon that the show is at its best.
Now I understand why they named the sets of rick and morty "Rick, C-137" and "Morty, C-137". It is the given number name of the iconic duo we watch in rick and morty episodes (I haven't seen this episode, so I can be wrong)
your gunna love me for this but i didint pirate this show like others
I like crayons
Don't yall mean build a morty workshop?
This show helps me to forget what pieces of shit we all are .
that sounds wrong 1:14
I hope to see hundreds of new rick and morty seasons, 9 to 27 episodes each. Just simple adventures. To test my psyche, give me joy, relate with my fellow humans who think alike, go to conventions and take pictures with anyone who cosplays as anything from the show. I want to hear more zany catchphrases and contribute to our collective humor. I love you guys. :)
Great. Now release it on a streaming platform people actually watch
But the second he reveals he is evil we are gonne. Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
nice
I'm about to be 26 next month and I already look and feel like 40 year old Morty. 🙃
No please don't go political you're going to destroy the cartoon like you did series 4 nobody cares about your Democratic political views just keep it rolling make it fun make it cool now you're sounding more like South Park and family Guy... South Park is better though
Moleman Morty
Morty gonna be Jessica’s baby daddy
the end " wow " says alot
This ain’t  build a morty
is this an upcoming episode?
Why aren’t the other 3 new Morty’s pink like baby mice at first?
We can rebuild him we got the Te[burp]chnologie
I especially enjoy how I saw this in my recommended before watching this episode, and didn't even know that it was a spoiler
Morty as a millennial looked happy lol
"The citiadel runs on canon" I love that!
Omg too funny
“You’re about to get suspended with pay”
Glendale fucking sucks
Where do I watch rick and Morty   With out having cable and up to date  I have netflix and hulu
I really wish popular shows would leave out socially political bull crap , when South Park started that crap i lost interest, sucks 😕
Which season?
I missing episodes arent i
So if this is Rick c-137 doesnt mean that this old Morty is the same one from season one and up? Hes not c137 Morty but he is our original.  If that's the case why was he 40 years old?
lol
This ain't build a Morty , u can't pick and choose
How and why am I not surprised?
Now I want a tv show with 26 year old Morty lost in the multiverse.
Haha 1000th comment
Morty Forty
Rick and Morty pretty much now there in a show
Bio beds
Poor Morty grows up to look like his dad.
Waiiiit what episode is this
"I'm almost ready to sell out" is super ironic for a show that has sold out in every way possible the moment R&M became marketable. :P
Thanks for the spoilers
Which episode it is???
Lmfao that’s as 24 as 24 gets
I'm dissapointed the evil Morty arc is now complete. Now it really is going to be episodic.
“ woof, you’re about to be suspended with pay” 🤣🤣🤣
Tight
You have like seven..... Seven blogs  Tight
Time' has ruined Morty so hard
Problem with the cops shooting people joke is the guy had a gun, and was pointing it at them. Usually if someone points a gun at you, no matter the intention, you can shoot them in self defense.
ITS THE GUY FROM FORTNITE
0:42
A lot of sons are afraid they will become their Dads when they get older.  Morty should be very afraid considering his 40 year old self was even more pathetic and lame than Jerry!
I’m under the impression Rick knows exactly what’s gonna happen with the deep story canon at all times and actively chooses to avoid it because of how easy it is to guess.
You can actually hear so much of their true character tone in this clip when compared to their State of Georgia Vs. Denver Fenton Allen dub. "I ain't paying" and "Listen to me!" @0:58 and @1:18 compared to @2:02 and @3:25  of their trial dub.
This season is so Incredible I love this serie :')
🌎🔜🔥B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior who Rose again. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️
As a resident of Glendale, that is a visceral feeling in describing an area.
This was awesome. I think a lot of the moving parts in Rick and Morty go under appreciated
1:19 HE KNEW
The hunchback Morty looks more like Tarzan fuzed with Quasimodo
suspended with pay lmfao
Stopped watching because season 4 IMO was weak but this is back to that good good writing
Performed Perfect
1 million views
Millionth view. Sweet.
"Even pooping hurts now." Some people have NO idea right now, and that hurts.
Wow, I didn't even realise it reads RE-Build A Morty, rather than Build A Morty. Really forshadows the idea that some ricks really did manufacture/build/produce their own morties
I like andy
They are no longer the TALIBAN.   ..  They are the TALIBidens
release the full soundtrack in the "Rick backstory" scene
There almost no Ricks in the citadel.
"Oof you're about to get suspended with pay. Now let's get out if here before it gets political." Literally "yes we said it, no were not going into it move on"
"Fine, I could eat. But the SECOND he reveals he's evil, we're gone"  Rick's genre savviness is always some of the best bits
The fouth wall breaking is crazy 🤯
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!
I wish every episode would be canon. Since season 4 there are to many random episodes without any value for the backstory.
I love how Morty lies to Rick that 26 years have past, and Rick just rolls with it.
WAS THAT A MATPAT REFERENCE?
1:22 "Woof, you're about to get suspended with pay."  I love lines like these.
The best tv series to exist
Bro why he look like troy baker 💀
Why did they have to make 26 Y/O morty that hot
I like Crayons ! Girls are Grose WOW 🤣
I’m under the impression Rick knows exactly what’s gonna happen with the deep story canon at all times and actively chooses to avoid it because of how easy it is to guess.
-You know I destroyed this place? +You've been pardoned for that, sir.  This implies Citadel admitted that they can't handle C137
What the--
21-22 hours ago, yay
Wow 896k views in just 2 hours?!
“Th th that sounds really violent” 💀💀
I'm 26 and feel seriously called out, shit.
Is it just me, or does the way mole Morty delivers the line "Listen to me!" sound just like judge Morty?
Poor 26 yr old Morty
40 year old Morty looks like 40 year old Timmy Turner
Love your content!! It's so well produced. Stay safe everyone 🌞🌻🌞
Can you make more rick and morty videos on Netflix Because its stopped at season 4 And I need a all 5 account on rick and morty to watch season 5
"Fine, I could eat. But the SECOND he reveals he's evil, we're gone"  Rick's genre savviness is always some of the best bits
Últimamente Adult Swim está muy activa en YouTube no?
It's honestly amazing how cynical and up his own ass Dan Harmon is
"Woof, you're about to get suspended with pay." That was incredibly timely, but the sad thing is that it would've been timely 5 years ago and it still will be 5 years from now.
I have an idea for season 6 episode 1: Rick goes on YouTube to learn how to make his Milan Szechuan sauce
they absolutely nailed the annoying progressive 20 somethings
I was wondering if the pink was gonna be important guess not
I literally just watched this like a second ago, and it’s uploaded pretty recently nice
0:42 Young Morty Smith 1: I like crayons.  Young Morty Smith 2: Girls are gross.
1:00 Whoa, hello there
I am the only Who think 26 Morty Is hot?
The Glendale joke was literally the most on point thing that Morty said this season.
1:28 Man's last request. To be influencial. 7 blogs are tight. 😁
This citadel runs in Canon LOL
This was perfect. The fact that we get to see citadel again, and Monty, he looked perfect for age 26.
Some rambling thoughts on the finale:  Watching countless Ricks and Mortys die in The Rickshank Redemption was sad but also comedic. Watching the Rick and Morty massacre in this episode was genuinely horrific. Incredible episode.  It introduces a (now confirmed) layer to the quote "Ricks hate themselves the most," seeing how a Rick likely killed C-137's family. Imagine have to stare at the face of your family's killer in the mirror over and over again (the extreme guilt!) and trying to get revenge on said killer over and over again- failing each time- having only more fakes to hunt down, face, and fail. That is self-loathing taken to the extreme.  I know Ricks are considerred evil but there had to have been heroic Ricks trying to save other more innocent Ricks from C-137's rampage only to die to his wrath and eventual callousness. Watching C-137 going around killing Ricks who were just minding their business was horrific as well. The image of a Rick surviving the carnage and begging at C-137's leg for mercy alongside another Rick basically submitting to C-137 as though C-137 were a God was particularly chilling. You don't see Ricks that helpless. Reminds me of when C-137 prayed to God near death.  There's also no guarantee all Ricks with portal technology were evil and abandoned their families. Remember Evil Rick's ranking of the morality of Ricks? I keep thinking the Beth the show started with had a Rick killed by C-137's rampage, which is why she thought her father abandoned her. He could have been adventuring or been trying to take down the murderer C-137 was proving himself to be. Said deceased Rick could have been a man of family AND science- not including all the other, healthier, Ricks who may have managed to balance their scientific-portal-life with their personal life. What if there were Ricks adventuring to find a way to save their loved ones from something that wasn't their doing only to get killed by C-137? There were so many Ricks killed who could have been honorable figures and those who never abandoned their families but were taken away from them. Imagine that being further explored as a plot point.   The Rick that likely killed C-137's family? What if he was the one who wanted to kill a bunch of Ricks and didn't mistakenly miss killing C-137 but used C-137 as a pawn to carry out Rick genocide? What if that killer Rick would later have Evil Morty as a grandson/sidekick- even if temporarily? That would help explain both of their genocidal tendencies for their own goals especially if their connection was genetic (or if Evil Morty adopted similar behaviors as said Rick).  Speaking of, what if Evil Morty was passed along from one unspeakably evil or insane Rick to the next? Or instead of being passed on, Evil Morty kept fleeing on his own only to be captured by other horrible Ricks in a nearly endless cycle? That would also help in explaining his obsession with fleeing absolutely everything Rick or Morty.  Honestly I'm a tiny bit disappointed that Rick's backstory was 80% accurate. I was hoping for something like <50% accurate. I mean to say, snippets of Rick's backstory could have truths or lead to other truths, I felt like we were given too much information and the writers should have committed to more of the falsehood, which would make the later reveal be more shocking/new. I feel like a majority of the backstory being true doesn't match up with the quote "totally fabricated origin story" quote- I know Rick's trolling but it made me hyped for a bigger mystery. One example of what I was feeling; I was hoping the name "Diane" was the name of an important canon figure but not actually the name of Rick's wife in the way the audience was led to believe. Or that he lost his family a different way. So not a total lie, not the total truth- just slightly misleading. But what the writers did with Rick's reaction and descent was very fascinating so props to that! I'm really just nitpicking the result was still very cool and I enjoyed the episode immensely.  I also kinda wished Evil Morty wasn't written to have lied to Morty about the escape seat, it would have been interesting to see a single Morty that evil Morty doesn't entirely despise. That type of villainous betrayal isn't that fun. But Rick's line afterwards was definitely funny. But Evil Morty being so emotionally detached is also very interesting in its own right so this is also obvious nitpicking.  Since green portals are theorized to connect to only other universes where a Rick is the most intelligent, it appears the earlier portal-gun-inventor-Ricks designed them this way from the start. They never planned to be able to travel to non-Rick-dominated worlds. Unless they did but someone came by and changed things to prevent more Ricks from getting killed too early.   I wonder how the comic writers are going to deal with this new canon. How are they going to work with their established Citadel of Mortys and role-swapped Rick and Mortys? How does the the comic, Rick and Morty Presents: The Council of Ricks, fit into the new canon? I know the show is more canon than the comics but the poor comic writers have to adjust to all these other revelations in their own works. The Central Finite Curve's purpose suggests Tall Morty/Slow Rick used to be intelligent or that he's somehow a type of Morty- or whatever other fun reason. I suppose it can be handwaved by the explanation that the comics are focusing on an alternate Central Finite Curve nearly identical to the one in the show, since an infinite number of realities mean an infinite number of intelligent Rick's to hand into an infinite number of Finite Curves.  Rick and Morty's relationship is very interesting here (I feel a certain subtext going on) it's definitely cool to watch how the two deal with eachother as they're clearly codependent in a way that started out rather similar to Beth and Jerry- which Jerry even pointed out.  I, like countless others, really wished we saw more of the citadel and everyday life there. So many opportunities for more jokes. And characters too. Honestly I felt kind of emotional for the loss of the Citadel alongside its Ricks and Mortys. Got emotional at the breakup and even Evil Morty finally becoming free. Still mourning, not going to lie.
I wish the 20-year-old Morty got to live
0:23 Godzilla Morty!
I love how little fucks the Re-Build-A-Morty Morty gives.
Adult Morty saying tight is TIGHT!
Forget the disposal cost, I'll take the excess 26 years for free.  Hot damn Morty
Morty as a fat middle age man was so random, this last episode of season 5 was the smartest one out of all the other season 5 episodes.
와 재밋겟다
Aight I gotta Watch Season 5
An someone explain the 7 blocks joke?
Yeah its funny cuz i only have hbo max and season 5 isnt on there
I'm sorry my IQ isn't high enough to understand this. What's going on??? Poop? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
This is so canon and very confusing and I love it
*"The citadel runs on canon"* oh boy did it. Just less than 10 minutes later😂
Build a bitch but it’s morty
I was somehow thinking createing my own show that is a sequel of Rick and Morty
Never been happier about not w@tching any of this show
Ok
Young adult morty could gettit.
*”Woof, you’re about to get suspended with pay”* This show, such pure genuine 😭
PR Morty: "W-W-What if we have a cool new mascot that celebrates the comradery between Ricks & Morties without degrading either?" Suit Rick: "Cool Cool." (Hires a Morty character actor)
26 year old morty sounds like a millenial
DUDE THE FINALE WAS SO GOOD
The only reason Morty looks like that at his “40’s” is because he intented himself to look a fucked up mess to cause emotional pity to Rick, he said it himself in the episode, so chill people, Morty still has a chance to be good looking like Grandpa
Lol 26 year old Morty look is pretty generic I guess
Mi name is argentina xd¿?
bruh, they could cancel the series right now and i wouldn’t be surprised. that felt like an end to the whole show
Police: Shoots innocent dude rick: your about to be suspended with play  its funny but so true
I'm here how wondering how he survived getting sliced in 3
Which episode is this from?
I thought they would do the episode about young and adult Morty and have a lesson including the old Morty.
"The citadel is a weapon of mass destruction."   How?
Well, at least at 39 I look more like 26 yr old Morty than 40 yr old Morty... Pooping does hurt tho
MY FAVORITE
Free disposal. Just find a trigger happy police officer and they'll shave 26 years off your life without charges.
Watching yt clips of this season without seeing the episodes is a mindfuck
this is the best parody of a 26 year old ever as a 26 year old
He won't be missed.
"now, now is the time for action"  waits and does nothing for four years until rick and morty come back to the citadel
Honestly to me the pacing feels all off in the new season. It's just joke after joke really rapidly and kind of feel of "okay I guess now this random thing is happening". Older seasons feel much more coherent to me, even with the random nature of the show
I love the background mall music 😂
I don't want to ruin season 6, but Rick created the central finite curve to protect the infinite "normal Ricks" who chose to stay with Beth. We will need at least 2 Canon episodes next season to fix what evil Morty did. ⚡
Just realized the 2 Morty Kids were 7 years each... combined to make him 14 years old.. the 26 year old if you add the ages = 40 years
Morty shot handsome morty in mid 20s
Young man Morty is kinda hot tbh
Morty really look like zzyz
0:39 I was hoping he turn into a pickle
Fuck you rick im here for cannon and lore
I love how even as a little child he sounds exactly the same
To you non Vals. Glendale once had a problem with bands of feral Chihuahuas.
I kinda like pink morty
The dude in Morty's hand portal was the real future Morty.
Does anyone know what the tattoo on his right arm is supposed to be?
I still can't buy that any rick would become drones like that lol
This show used to be funny. Now it's just a boring shit show like what family guy and Simpson has turned into.
So we're all just gonna pretend that there's no difference between a 14 yo Morty's voice and a 40 yo Morty's voice ?
I was surprised to see that this Morty wasnt the "Evil" Morty's backstory, but was just another Morty in the machine made by a mad Rick.
I hope Summer(mostly her), Beth and Jerry find and rescue Rick and Morty onS6(they’re stuck in space)

ur skins all pink,like a baby mouse made me laugh so hard
„The citadel runs on canon” He knows way too much :v
"Whoof you're about to get suspended with pay"  Lmfao wow
Wait where's this bit coming from?? Seems better than the whole 5 season
What episode was this? I missed this.
Awesome Rick and Morty Video.
Am I the only once that noticed the ref to that movie The 6th Day? That is a classic sci fi Arnold movie.
Was hoping Influencer Morty would’ve stayed around for a bit. Oh well
s-ss-something unfair is happening. with no contex or observation. like a 6th sence lmao
Sad jesus morty and his sad rick in 00:22 cracks me up everytime
I feel attacked.
Besides making a morty he cant be replaced now so hes gonna have to care or lose morty forever
Best scene of the episode lmao  “Woof, you’re about to get suspended with pay”
Which he does...
Yo I need my spectrum ID already to watch this sh*t
If this is what Morty looks like in his then, Rick was right; he is gonna get laid in college.
This ain't build a Morty-  You don't get to pick and choose   😟
Holy shit. 20-year-old Morty was hot. Like, super hot. I need more.
Who cares, I like it when these things are canon!
Twenty-six year old Morty has his grandpa's hair style from when he was thirty-five!
So crazy everyone just walks past that “you’re about to get suspended with pay” line because we all know it’s true
What episode is this
Lol the citadel runs on canon, it's not a simple adventure. Self awareness well made.
Man, those 14 years after his 26th were REALLY unkind to Morty xD .
This season has started with a dinner, and with a dinner (or maybe a lunch?) it ends
Never thought Morty would wear a lab coat lol
this was fumny
Wait, so Morty's still 14 since the first season?
This ain't build a morty you don't get to pick and choose.
It must have been a rough 14 years for 26 year old Morty to turn into 40 year old Morty
Has it occurred to anyone that C-137 is what they classify Rick as and that’s the classification of Radiation lol the man is toxic from start to end. And yet I think there’s hope for him
I'm annoyed the season finale is the creative directors just venting out hate and frustration over there fans. As much as some of the plot was paid off I was not really in the happiest of mood. I treated it like another boring episode of family guy.
Build-a-morty
At 0:12 you can see a Morty carrying around his own portal gun. I'm willing to bet he's from a reality where he accepted Rick's decision to end their relationship from the last episode. Instead of trying to continue the toxic partnership they had, he seems to have come to terms with how things have ended and is opting for solo adventures with just himself.
1:13 Rick got out of the disposal cost….
Morty keeps screwing stuff up. It doesn’t matter that Rick warns him first. And after the screw up, all he does is apologize for a moment just to go back to another screwed up.
This was a good season finale in a crappy season. We have a new villain to look forward to. Murder Rick which killed C137s wife and daughter.
Rick and Morty, Rick and Morty  Rick and Morty, Rick and Morty Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick
If Morty supposed to be a zoomer why did his 26 year old self act like a SJW?
I love that as the show goes on we start to see how Morty really is a piece of shit
Not gonna lie. 26 year old Morty actually looks really good. He’s more confident and he looks cool
"They made it Glendale"...Holy shit I've been waiting on Hollywood to rip on Glendale forever. Smooth and subtle. Well done.
I like how woke the 26 year olds Morty was. And how he tried to stop something that was unfair
Who feels that season 5 was mediocre?
Epic
“Im almost ready to sell out” that was funny but it hurt lol
I bet you didn't even think about how "Trash Goober" is actually a metaphor for the audience. While the audience is well educated in many ways they're eager to consume garbage.
Oh so that's why morty is still 14 even though he's been with rick for 6 years as rick says in s5 e9
When cartoon characters grow up with the same outfit XD
Should've deaged him to his actual age which is about 17.  Also how tf did Morty age himself???
1:28      I think killing the Oregon/Seattle version of Morty was a good idea
Ryan Elder thinking he can sneak a lick by me huh haha
Twenty-six year old Morty doesn't look like I thought he would.  I expected more of Jerry.
Which episode is this?
All I need is simple adventure
Worst season but this episodes made it worth watching
Hey Adult Swim, how about cancelling all that boring live action shit and all those horrendously unfunny, stiffly animated adult sitcoms and fund a proper Final Space season? That show was way too good to end off on a cliffhanger.
crazy episode
As a 26 year old, I feel very attacked. I sold out years ago.
What episode is this?
"Woof. You're about to get suspended with pay"  Wow.
Definitely not a left wing agenda...
What episode is this
The hight of mature Morty really is the nail in the coffin for the ' Morty is Rick' theory.
I find it soo funny how they used the 26 year old morty to mock at millennials........ "Was I influential" Hahahaha
26 year old Morty hit too hard. I’m also almost ready to sell out.
Fan theory right here, Rick's Infinity was destroyed, it was gold. Evil morties portal is gold just like the infinity. Infinity cant be destroyed or everything would be destroyed, Evil morty has created a new infinity of evil morties
Poketmorty in a nutshell
Oh no, they made Morty into a redditor
this episode is fucking NUTS.
9/10/21
Wow, its a good thing president Morty wasn't evil at all and Rick and Morty were able to have a nice pleasant dinner with him before heading home
Hi.
Wish Adlut Swim Would Save Final Space
Well at least Rick doesn’t have to pay for disposal
Would be better if it was RandY For Rick and Morty
Rick knows its evil morty because it is evil rick in the richest morty
Gotta admit, Motry’s doing well for himself at 26.
havent seen the woke people come after this yet this is hilarious
And then....
We might have only known you for 37 seconds but you will always be in our hearts Influential Morty 👍
Rick breaking the fourth wall just tells you the writers are kinda lost with the plot.
Serve my body as street tacos
26 year Morty is kinda giving Zayn Malik vibes.
That's the song from the rick n morty game!
Can we just all agree that Morty with long hair and beard looks fucking awesome?
Ok I dont see anyone else mentioning the line "they made it Glendale", but the citadel does sorta look like the Americana on Brand lol.
So now we see a 4 year old morty
At least they didn't shoot a black morty
I don't remember watching this episode?
Gonna be honest 26 year old morty is attractive
It’s official I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure my last words are “was I influential”.
Glendale or greendale?
i wonder if rick C-137  is the evil rick from the other mortyverse
When did this come out or still not aired yet ?
1:17 The mutant Morty was a good guy, shame
Is this the last season ;(?
Police: *Shoots innocent dude* "Let's get out of here before this gets political"  This show's humor is genius
I just noticed Godzilla Morty at 0:23.
Probably a stupid guess but what if that evil Morty once was a Rick. He seems very intelligent for a Morty. Plus Rick himself could never become president of the citadel if he needed to.
looks were getting into evil morty story line ill wait for this one
Also a nice role reversal that Rick’s complimenting the Citadel while Morty’s putting it down. Great character development right there.
I wonder if ageing serums are the reason Mortys have been fourteen for years on end. Makes sense given Ricks need them.
9+10
Shoots two people "Woof you're gonna get suspended with pay"
Didn’t they say in episode that he just made himself older
We all know Morty will never grow up. Ever.
"The citadel only runs on canon" lol
And then, that same night, Evil Morty finally did the thing that he wanted to do, with the curve thing.
The like to dislike ratio is literally 173:1!
No lie was the best episode in the entire show great writing especially for the evil morty arc and the ending just blew everyone’s mind 🎊🤯
Chad morty
Oh... My gosh. I have to buy this season!! The small build up of evil Morty has enticed me from the beginning
Why did the writers gave Morty a pinkish skin tone without any reason? And why doesn´t he have it after they went to the President? Seems to me a bit sussy, my guys.
You’re about to get suspended with pay👮‍♂️
"Morty, the idea was to get back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on canon"
"You are about to be suspended with pay" every cop case in USA :V
Suspended with pay LMAO
Is this a dig at Glendale AZ for mortgaging their future to build the new Cardinals Stadium + corporate-walkable mall?
"The citadel runs on canon" the self awareness in this show is hilarious
So he’s a… Forty Morty?
I’m 26 and must sayyyy accurate
1:05 i like this version of morty
Morty has hair similar to Rick.... and it looks good on him...
Build a Bear on ultra steroids
Morty has no neck whatsoever no matter what age he is
"Hi! I'm Citadel's new mascot, Andy! Because this place wouldn't be home without Ricks "andy" Mortys!" "Dumb."  IKR?
to be honest,  not a big fan of this season,   but man, they really can make such scene hilariously memorable each season
morty turned into forty. get it?
“I’m almost ready to sell out”  28-year-old me: oof
⏰ 📝
7 blogs is Tight!!
This ain't build a morty, you don't get to pick or choose
"Oof your about to get suspended with pay" Perfect, no notes.
Was i influential?
1143
´´fine, but the second he reveals he's evil were gone´´ Narrator: And he was evil
“Something unfair is happening”-26 year old morty
tight.
Will there be episode 11?
I cant believe cop morty gets suspended with pay
40 year old morty and 26 year old morty should've had a different voice than regular morty. Imo it doesn't make sense for Morty to still sound like a 14 year old boy when he is all grown up. They should've used mabye Justin Roiland's regular voice as the voice of adult Morty.
Deformed Morty was actually right how did I not catch this? Also they could’ve just sent young man Morty To another dimension
I’ll miss the citadel
"Fine, I could eat. But the SECOND he reveals he's evil, we're gone"  Rick's genre savviness is always some of the best bits
I've been binging this series n morty is such a dick . He causes 90% of their problems by refusing to listen to rick , then after everything goes sideways he tries blaming rick for it. What a tithead
Rebuld of evangelion
Morty Police: Kills someone  Rick : OOF , you are about to get suspended with pay !  Lol
I think the creators are happy with this episode. They got all the canon stuff fans have been dying for out the way that they constantly complain about not wanting to do so now they can just focus on episodic advantures.
Yooo I’ve never been attracted to Morty before
This has been a long time coming while we split into different realities let me explain why you're pos for revealing evil Morty and then leaving it for what 3..4 years now fing assholes...jk love you guys Rick and Morty and Solar Opposites amazing Harmon
I too waited till the very end of the video
1:18 He was not wrong...
Rick and Morty is a dnd campaign where the two players just end up avoiding doing the main quest at all costs
Can't believe that Jacksepticeye got a cameo
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
Morty is such a Ζoomer. "I'm ready to sell out", "Something unfair is happening", "Let me help you. This is not a good look" "Was...I...Influential?"
Shoulda hooked up 28 with Planetina.
So at least morty got on on rick seeing how he shaved his head into the rick patch, while rick is sporting the naturale without choice.
"You're about to get suspended with pay"...  I can only laugh at how accurate to that is....
I just realized, if Morty hadn’t talked Rick into going for the meeting, they likely would have just tried to portal home and be torn apart. So Morty kinda saved their lives.
You didn't even give him time to Brace Himself!
Without Abed to channel all the meta, sometimes it leaks out of Rick
Yes
Damn. And I thought Jerry was already lame. Older Morty just couldn’t get himself together.
In a previous opening they had a store where morties are like action figures
Bella Poarch Joined A Group :)
26 yr old. To Young to Die! )):
Morty be lookin like Jack stauber
Something unfair is happening!
"President Morty, would in fact, turn out to be evil."  -Morgan Freeman (probably)
I don’t like how the energy guns sound like normal guns.
I really like how you can hear futuristic cadillac buzzing in the background while Rick is being invited to see Morty president.
I would ask why the Ricks don't use the service to keep themselves permanently in their 30's, then I remembered that Rick is an immortal cyborg and age has no meaning to him.
I love the subtly of the tattoo on middle aged morty. Something you see on a lot on guys that age.
How can Morty be the same age as season 1
Rebulid of evangelion
What episode is this??
if there's such a high demand for morty's, couldn't they just take extra-aged mortys and break them down into more 14 yr old mortys to sell? rick couldve taken the 26 yr old morty, broken him down and had a 14 to sell and a 12 to age up lol
“Oof, you’re about to get suspended with pay” 😭😂
The Morty mutants are like the mutants from Total Recall (1st movie).
26 year old Morty looks really cool
26 year old Morty is a Chad...
e
I love the fact that 40 year-old morty and 26-year-old Morty look perfectly normal in the Citadel.
Tight
It seems like everything is slowed down now
I have a question , remember the episode where rick was falsely accused of killing another rick and all the ricks were at rick C-137’s house? There was a dumb rick there who bonded with jerry how did he manage to get into the central finite curve ? If he is so dumb..arent all the ricks in CFC supposed to be the smartest man in the universe
Rick's reaction to the new Citadel is telling.  He actually likes the change.  All the Morty imagery appeals to him.  Looking back, it indicates that his previous dislike of the place stemmed from his own self-loathing, seeing himself egotistically exalted all over the place.
how did the portals work fine at the beginning of this video but later on in the episode the portals kill everyone? rick is very smart i would have went into that portal and got shred into pieces i would have never thought anything happen to the portal gun.
Sucks Chad Morty died he looks incredible at 26 years old.
" 7 blogs " " tight "
Summer is not very attractive like Jerry while Morty older is it must be Beth and Ricks gene's
Т
I like the morty wearing a lab coat just like rick
Morty looks like Dan Harmon!
tight
"They made it Glendale" As in, Glendale, California? Or are they talking about something else? And if it IS Glendale California, is that bad or good? I don't live in California
When they first visited the citadel, Rick called a product being sold by some rick “dumb”, here it was morty who called the andy thing dumb with the exact same tone, just a fun lil detail
I hope Cop Rick and Morty Squad survived the Citadel's destruction.
morty more like farty
This is a really crazy reference to that Build-a-Bear store chain.
I hate Morty so much. Worthless character
What's wrong with me if I think 20's Morty is pretty great?
Lmao the fact that Rick mentioned this is Canon is funny as fuck
‘The second he reveals he’s evil we’re gone’ Accurate
So the citadel was destroyed twice in less than one year.  Oof
why does buff morty look like me? without the tattoo.
When did Morty go from being pink to regular Morty? Were we still following this Morty for the rest of the episode, or a different one?
"Woof. You're about to get suspended with pay" perfect!
what episode is this??
Glad to see Rick c137 is still alive and kickinh
😭👏👍
dripping swag like a broken faucet
Best scene in the whole episode, for me.
My good my recently Evangelion obsetion is making me see references where they aren't.
Hello everybody my name is Mortyplier
Bedrock hard abbs
Old morty looks like a lil bit like jerry
Can anyone explain to me where this little pieces of story come from? There are not in the normal episodes?
"they made it Glendale" Is that a community reference?
Justin Roiland talks to himself for 2 minutes.
Love this fuckin show!!
0:19 "Even pooping hurts now"  Fiber bro, it ain't your enemy.
I love how they couldn’t just make a Morty hospital, they had to build a Rebuild a Morty
This was a God Tier episode.
This ain’t build a morty😂
I wanna hug the small Mortys.
As a straight guy saying this, 26 year old Morty looks like he'd be quite a catch for some lucky girl out there, perhaps Jessica once she comes down off of that Time God mindset
Why does Rick just not do it himself. Is this something he can't fix? Why do Ricks have jobs like being a police, a body guard, a hair stylist. When they could literally print money if they want. WHY WHY WHY.
1:48 I'm with you Rick. Having watched all five seasons of Steven Universe, I've grown a bit sick of arcs myself. I prefer shows whose episodes you can play out of order and it'll still look like nothing has happened.
Damn Mortys about to glow up when he’s 22
--------------------------------------------------
ha boomer Morty
The Citadel fuels itself on Canon
matpat the prophet
Soy el line numero "1,000" aguevo B)
If there are infinite ricks and morties, logically its impossible for the citadel to hold them all
i stil don't get how rick is asking a morty to reverse old mortys age
Lol
Love this season so much🧡
would it be funny if the machine split morty in half kids and killed coldly one of them?
What episode is this?
Can’t wait for the next season…in like … 4 years
That fresh pink skinny, lol!!! >_<
Evil villain won't say evil, they are professional actor remember important plan inside, even better than Waspinator, he mess up a lot by reviewing his evilness and lack of problem solving ideas.
How does Rick even know that President Morty was Evil Morty? Regardless of whether it runs on cannon or not, he wasn't there during the Citadel episode. (S3)
“I like crayons” “Girls are gross”  I laughed so hard
Older morty is handsome,  Jessica would fall for that
"Woof, you're about to get suspended with pay"  God DAMN lol.   Also man, chad morty.
“Nobody leave, everybody stay” is one of the most stupid moment to ever happen,  I mean seriously, those guys were Ricks and still continued to commit suicide
I bet Jessica would be simping for 26 year old Morty
What I don't understand that wasn't not the real cl37 that was another Rick and yes he would of rejuvenize the Mort in his garage.
A lot of sons are afraid they will become their Dads when they get older.  Morty should be very afraid considering his 40 year old self was even more pathetic and lame than Jerry!
I think this confirms that morty is not rick.
It's nice to see the citadel again, while it lasted. That music playing sounded like it would fit in Pocket Mortys.
The Citadel runs on canon.  What's the storage/disposal option on that?
Morty is a horribly out of shape 40 year old.
"I'm almost ready to sell out" Yeah I remember those days.
Please bring back Final Space.😟
Re-Build-A-Morty Workshop. "Where Best Friends Are Made."
He's worse than ever
This episode sure had a lot to swallow
I’m under the impression Rick knows exactly what’s gonna happen with the deep story canon at all times and actively chooses to avoid it because of how easy it is to guess.  Edit: I'm not saying I predicted it or anything like that, I'm saying that from Rick's perspective, he knows what's gonna happen with everything because of how smart he is.
This ain’t build a morty (a morty) you don’t pick and choose.  Better pants or better shirt, if he needs a Rick too.
RIP 26 years old Morty
Wow Gollum Morty My Precious.
I’m really enjoying season 5
Build a bear should be taking notes
Y'all really had me thinking this was gonna be some random lowkey filler finale to cap off S5 before hitting me with the Evil Morty + Rick's backstory. 100 years, Adult Swim
Chad sigma male morty vs beta male morty
I’m 4th
.
This ain't build a morty you don't get to pick and choose different meeseeks different ricks
Is president Morty, evil Morty?
