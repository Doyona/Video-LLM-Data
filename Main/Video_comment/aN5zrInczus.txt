it was a woman
me too when she used to do her intro and show up❤
It was super weird to hear you say my name this many times😂 also I have a brother named bryan 🤮
I have always said NO ONE is worth going to prison over!
Side note: was she fckin smiling in her first mugshot???
Where is Abby, mama? 😔
Vengeance is mine,,,THE HULK,,, Happy Halloween 👻🎃🎃🎃❤aaaahh.
Also to clarify it was called the peacemaker because it was used by lawmakers to “maintain the peace” in older times lol I know this video is old and I do love your guess
Ok and if it was the other way around no one would think she manipulated him and everyone would focus on the fact that HE did it so I don’t wanna hear it. I’m not saying he shouldn’t have also gotten a life sentence though
first off how does life insurance companies not put two and two together? Also, they both should have life in prison.
The way I screamed at 22:09 “weird to say after slapping meats together” 😂😂😂😂
“It wasn’t the husband.”  It was the husband.
“Let’s hope that 2022 treats us right” uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  yeah….
28:15 "Ben divorced Jennifer" 😂😂😂
I miss this theme song Bailey...it's who you are bruhhh
I have Lupus and it stinks 😩
Not me binging everything from the beginning. And I will just say. Gosh these stories scare me everything is great and dandy and then partner wants to off you. Ugh no maybe I'll just stay single forever 😂
Anyone know the foundation brush at the start bailey uses? X
So, Brian isn't in the kitchen.
At chads house
My cousin named Jen to
Invent the wallet brawl so no one can’t steal your purse from you

2025 ❤ baby
Swear your theme song one my fave parts your videos, obviously your whole video top notch fave. But that song & ur lil jive to it gets me ery time
Yes, it seems like I'm a "lil" late to this video!  However, I have to confess a creepy fact (don't judge me)!.. I watched this video when it was posted, several yrs ago, n have rewatched it a few times n by a few times, I mean many times!  In my defense, I'm a huge @BaileySarian fan!  Also, if anyone noticed, my name's Jennifer n I quite enjoy hearing Bailey, my bestie (in my head) say my name, repeatedly, throughout the video!  Phew, I feel a little better now taking that off my chest! 😅🖤
Love all your videos.
I love how you, you are!! Inspiring!  Im so glad youtube brought you to my page!
ASU mentioned what???? i go there right now and have lived in San Angelo my who life
I loved Ft. Carson. My oldest was born there. Always something to do. Never boring.
Have you done darya Nikolayevna saltykova? If not can you do her? If so could you do Juana barraza?
i go to angelo state i’m so surprised it was mentioned bc our town is not very well known
Watching in 2025. I so miss the theme song!
L
Watching again 7/2025!
I been down for  bailey
Off topic but I always wondered why she puts the piercing in before makeuppp
Jen did get life (minus 3 months).  Sad story
Church goer + military affiliate = disaster
Who let Jennifer's ex-mother-in-law testify?!
Where are your hair clips from?
my sister has lupus and it's  Awful😢😢😢
What happened to the children?
Life without parole is a joke.
Look at the lack of brains in Brian 😂
Lol I went to ASU, most boring town on plant Earth
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
👍🏼
Pure talent. No words
Wasn’t Joe Kenda a cop there during this time ?
En español.?????
Who's here in June 2025 😂❤🎉
Joe Kenda was the detective on the case! I love how he describes it! He’s hilarious, Bailey you have to watch him you’d love him lol 😂
I’ve never in my 38 years of life heard the term “Slapping meats” but it’s my new favourite thing to say.
Hey Bailey, I have noticed that girls who know how to do makeup well don’t seem to put foundation or primer or anything on their eyes…I have a pinkish undertone, especially around my eyes so I feel like I need foundation. Reason not to? Thank you, pretty! You are adorable!
Husband is now out on parole and no doubt PREACHING again. Gives me creeps.
Watching May 2025💖💖💖
I think this is my favorite video of yours.  lol I laughed as I shouldn’t
Watching on 5/7/25 I was wondering if you could possibly do mmm on crystal Walter’s because she was killed and it’s still a mystery there’s conspiracy theories about this case and her father was on to something maybe he had found something that could have helped the case or maybe even solve the case and he was killed there is definitely a cover up going on in this town about this case
May 2025 ? Anyone?
Do the Jeff Davis 8 please! It’s about Hometown. Eight girls bodies were found within a few years and they were all connected to each other. It’s such a big controversy. Everyone says they know who did it, but nobody was prosecuted for it. Jennings Louisiana.
I feel bad for the ppl who used that jacuzzi after them
Slapping meats 😂😂
250,000 is a small town???? The town I grew up in had a population of about 2000 when I was growing up. The entire county currently has a population of 14,000. 😂😂
25:38 amen
Are we in clue? 😁😂😊❤
You should do one about emily pike mmiw case, bring attention amd awareness ❤
Watching from 2025! The theme songgggg 🥺🫶 love you Bailey!
You're kind of annoying. But I like it. New sub+
Watching in 2025 Bailey no one blames you for your breaks… you dig deep into these effed up things you need to take care of yourself
I believe Jennifer and what she said about Brian but I also think he needs to be in there for a lot longer then what he got he manipulated her but they both are getting what they deserve
"let me think....... no." bailey i screamed 😭🙏
April of 2025~ Bailey never gets old✌️☺️
The makeup is gorgina in this video 😍
Heard this one again.. you're such a fun story teller ❤❤❤
these older videos still make me so happy (to see Bailey, not the crimes) ❤
Some ppl r unfortunately easily manipulated.. but they should both still be in prison I think
I googled it lol it's called the piece maker because in the west it was used to try and keep the piece ... I like Bailey's answer more
LOVING your hair in this video, Bailey! I'm gonna try this! Lol
4th April 2025
I don’t think Colorado Springs is considered a small town but yeah, no. Crazy story.
Yall LT. Joe Kenda worked this case
I miss the theme song so much 😭❤ here in 2025
It's a Joe Kenda case!
clicked this as a co springs local 😂 im so done with finding out my states weird smh
I'm years late to this video, but just wanted to point out that all of Homicide Hunter (Joe Kenda) takes place in Colorado Springs, so ... Charming might be a stretch. 😂   I also lived there for awhile and it's a weird place, haha.
Love watching your videos! Your so funny!!
i love u bailey
Brian was very manipulative.
Its so hard to not smile while watching her intro's.. Yesss the hair is HAIRING.
Watching in 2025- and I have to say I still miss the theme song!
makeup combo ate queen!
We will love to have you visit Colorado Springs!! 😊
Jennifer did it
My mom passed from lupus in 2010. Its  a terrible sickness.
Who watching in March 2025?
Had to pause the1st time she said you're all thinking it's the husband I said "nope the mistress " im at 13:29 & she just said affair Bailey Sarian you're making me so smart😂😂😂
Watching 2025 just finished watching Danielle Kristy Sunday post then this popped up as recommended to watch next
I miss the theme song so bad but I get it I get it 😂
Fuuuuuuu. Hope he’s not still in Colorado.
the way you describe colorado springs is NOT AT ALL what it is  😭😭
Bailey: Where's Brian? Me: Brian is in the kitchen!
i live in a small town just up north from colorado springs. this story is absolutely wild and crazy how close to home it is
Hahaha no 0:39
Whats funny is i love your stories, but my first comment was going to be about how great your hair was ❤
as soon as i heard peacemaker it made me think of Wynonna Earp
✋️
2025 here Bailey! Still as fabulous as ever!!! 🎉
Here in 2025 ❤
LOL OK MISS BAILEY!! I came to an old video in hope you see this easier! So in a recent video you explained where your theme song came from. Now I've never watched that Paris Hilton show but I always thought it was  "Son of Sam, son of Sam, son su su sammmmmm! LOL I KNOW YOU'RE LAUGHING! ANYWAYS LOVE YA GIRLY!!! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🎉🎉
Who’s watching in 2025? ✋
The voice. I’m out.
Watching in 2025!!! I miss the intro song lol 😂😢
Watching in 2025!
I discovered Bailey in 2025, and I’m watching this in February 2025 🧡 Currently at 7.58M subscribers!
Just now watching in 2025 🫣
Watching in 2025
1:35 LOLOLOL ILY
Watching in 2025 and I miss 2022....
Where are you from? Do you ever have meet & greets
Out of curiosity i looked it up. So Bailey you were kind of right but also not really. 😅  "The old military revolver, specifically the Colt Single Action Army, was called the "Peacemaker" because the idea was that its presence could deter conflict and act as an equalizer, meaning that even a smaller or weaker person could defend themselves, thus promoting a sense of peace by discouraging aggression; the name is attributed to a quote from Samuel Colt himself, the gun's inventor, who said that his arms were the "best peacemakers"."
❤i love her 💘💘💘💘💘😍!!!!!
Love this makeup look! (Listening from Colorado Springs!)
Watching in 2025!🎉❤
Watching in 2025!
Watching 2025!!
I remember this one time my imaginary sister insisted she could carry the shovel, it was really heavy, so she raised it up and BAM it falls on my head almost execution style. We were like 4. I remember my head was busted open and I was rapidly bleeding. I ran around. Sakura saw me and she applied some ground coffee on my wound, but it was more serious than she thought. I remember doctors shoving my head in the sink and the blood pouring along with the water.  They wrapped my head with bandage. I returned to our hometown and the kids were playing. I was embarrassed bcs they started calling me Palestinian to make fun of how my head was bandaged up and we were playing this proximity catch game where when the times up we’re supposed to freeze and take position and each kid would scream shotgun on a country. I shouted Israel and you could tell they were scared. This is a true story. I remember going up the house and seeing Reem napping on the kitchen floor and I wanted to run at her and they held me back.
I met Jennifer in Cañon City when I went to the Scared Straight program as a teen. That place was scary. She’s a tiny lady. If you saw her in person you would never imagine.

Aqua Tofana - 2025
It's 2025 and I'm watching it again.❤🎉😮
Love you Bailey you make me feel happy just watching your videos ❤ love your hair ❤️
Watching in 2025 💗
Watching in 2025 lol
Watching now 2025
I love when my True Crime shows cross over 😂 That’s a Joe Kenda  case!
I miss the soulfully vibrant intro songs. 😢❤
Read and talk about. Life with billy worst sicko I ever read about. Had to put it down. Made me sick to my stomache
Sometimes I think Bailey could just sit and read a cookbook and I would be entertained! 😂
Relax not 2 day ❤
❤ your beautiful!
This is so disheartening and a grim reminder you shouldn’t idolize anybody. I admired Jay Z for his music of course, but more so for the documentary he was an executive producer on called TIME: The Kalief Browder Story. Heartbreaking case and Jay Z’s commentary when interviewed in the film was impactful and poignant.
“Ney ney” is my favorite thing that Bailey says!
Slapping meats 😂😂😂
Same.  NOV 24😊
YO THIS IS MY UNIVERSITY. like im watching bailey videos while SITTING in angelo state’s mathematics building!! i had no idea we were connected to something like this
Slapping meats is crazy work 😂😂😂😂
Religion strikes again..
Im watching this in 2024, and im a huge fan of like crime documentaries and some of the ones she covers I’ve seen from different show, I think Joe kinda covers this one on his show, but that don’t stop me from watching Bailey lol.
I live in San Angelo!!!
SLAPPING MEATS made me literally SPRAY my coffee out of my nose
BOOM SHAKA LACKA
It's Halloween 2024  I'm rewatching this ... I thought a peacemaker was called a peacemaker because it put you to sleep... ????
"slapping meats together" hehe
I have lupus ❤ thank you for explaining it some people think it’s like the plague 😂
See... this is why adultery is a sin 💀 Such a sad story. What about the children?
9x out of 10 if you use the title higher up they are evil
I’m from Colorado Springs
Love you Bailey. ......🎉🎉🎉🎉
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Watching in 2024! I’m hooked 😅🌹
Do Michelle Theer, also in Colorado!
I’m from Colorado Springs and for some reason this made me so happy you covered this case 😅
lol Bailey you looked so funny when you only did your lower lip 😂
THE IRIDESCENT BUTTERFLIES
Bailey I just have to say that your side commentary makes me CACKLE so hard🤣🤣
I miss your theme song
Genuinely surprised how old people looked during this time. The picture of Jennifer when she’s 28?? She looks way older
13:07 Bailey, are you Jau on messenger right now?
Miss this enthusiasm in the sanna saaaah
The more I watch you, the more I love you 💕 such a girls girl and I love your energy.
Ooo I miss a full blown theme song !!!
"slapping meats together"😂
Both should have got life sentences
This is why it’s important to look into your bible yourself. Not to mention if Diane found out he was cheating she has a biblical stance for divorce. This is wild.
You’re hilarious!!!
I can’t believe I’m just not hearing this story I grew up here and my high school graduation was on the army base
Y’all my dad lived in Colorado Springs in 1980-1990
Bailey, you were like my spirit animal I hope you never leave. I don’t know why but your videos are so relaxing and intriguing.
Idk if anyone else has said this but it seems to me like Jennifer was trying to set her husband up to take the fall. His gun... His clothes... Just a thought
Rewatching ur MM&MM series in 2024 🫶
Am i the only man watching!!!
IMO it was karma, Pancreatic Cancer is an automatic death sentence. She would have lived free during those years but she killed the wife.
The springs is wild, and it’s pretty quaint but you have to be very outdoorsy to live there cause there’s not much to do.
IMO, Jennifer def played a heavy hand in this. Shes smiling in her mugshot. Like girl, bsffr
Those sweet sweet days of “shun a sha shun a sha shun a sha sha shun a sha”. 😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
wait is it just me or does jennifer look like Jennifer Garner?????🤨🤨🤨
Re-watch August 2024. LOVE YOU BAILEY! ❤️You’re adorbs
Great description of  lupus as someone who has been living with this disease of over 20 years I am shocked many people don't know much about it
Brian got an additional 10 years to be served for escaping prison actually not 15 months
27:25 he played her and killed his  wife 😩
24:25 it’s giving Jim jones now 😩😩😩
1:50 two worlds Joe Kenda ☺️☺️☺️
The fact that I watch these as I get ready for my day. Bailey is like my second best friend. She's my energy drink. Keep up the great work! You're doing amazing! ☺🌹
Just goes to show money does not equal happiness. (Protip: neither does poverty.)
Is this another clip?
His face looks so familiar to me and it bothers me
Thank you Thank you for the theme song!!! Love the video as usual!!
Hi bailes!❤🎉
Bailey when are we gonna get some more merch! I need a restock!
Just adorable
The peace maker! LOL I love your definition best yet I have a feeling that isnt why its named that.
Colorado Springs is definitely not a small town lol I’m an hour and 45 minutes away from there love your vid’s Bailey ♥️🌹
What happened to the children? Where did they end up? Did Beia and Jennifer even think about the consequences for themselves or the children? They were very selfish.
I love this makeup look!
Always watching
i love for that theme song 😌🤌🤌
The theme song is everything. Please bring it back
I’ve been looking for this video for months - it’s the 18:24 mark I die 😂😂😂
Day 78 asking for paula sims, diane downs, andrea yates please bailey Do Paula sims, shes unbelievable, she killed her 2 baby daughters 3 years apart with both babies being weeks old heather and lorelai were both smothered and heather had been kept in the freezer to confuse time of death then dumped into a bin, lorelai was dumped in woods behind the house. Paula claimed an armed man came both times and knocked her out before taking nothing but the babies. This took part in the late 80s with the sentencing done in 1990. She now wants a new trial claiming post partum depression. The woman is stone cold
Peacemaker is the name of the gun Wynonna Earp uses in the show about demons.. only like 4 seasons tho. I love that show!
I find it interesting that a church leader would choose to buy a gun called a "peacemaker."
Rewatching and I FINALLY realize where I heard this story before. Gurl this was a joe kenda episode ! The true crime show that got me into this genre , I recommend the show for sure !! ALL of Joe kendas cases are in Colorado Springs too over 400 homicide cases
Rewatching in 2024 an the 2022 comment hits different 😂 because it in fact did not treat us better 😢😂
It technically was still the husband
What in the time travel is going on right now...are we in clue? 😂❤ I watched this whole section a few times. Now I got to know, is this written for you or is that all Bailey?? ❤ I'm also a Jennifer. Haven't even noticed why that's relevant yet
*jenniFER* 💀💀✨
Why do people have affairs? Just divorce the person 🙄
Love the background
Beautiful job on the makeup
I feel like everyone in Colorado has an antique gun collection 😂
PS Colorado Springs area is very charming and beautiful in my opion. I live outside the city because Colorado Springs itself can be violent (my grandma had a gun pulled on her like in this story only she wasnt shot thankfully) but in my small town outside the city I couldnt imagine living anywhere else or being away from the majesty of the mountains.
Bailey, I am from Colorado Springs and about jumped out of My chair because I've listened to your videos since 2020 and never noticed this story from my home town. Juicy! I can't wait to see what horror is in store for my home town that's a little twisted 😅
I have been a fan for some years and never interacted, just wanted to point out how beautiful you are, I love to watch your heart-shaped face while listening to crime stories, it really makes my evenings after work <3
The “what is this clue?” Took me out 😭😂
me
I believe Bryan story more than hers.
Knowing my own ex-husband and what people who have never lived or been in a romantic relationship with him think of him... I take Brian's brother-in-law's defense of him with the tiniest grain of salt possible. I'm not saying Brian is absolutely guilty (although, the smile in his mugshot doesn't exactly make him look innocent, either...), but you never know what's going on behind closed doors... and he *was* having an affair that his in-laws didn't know about. Just sayin...
I watch Bailey and “MeidasTouch” network every day. Crime to law law to crime. I have, Donald J. Sickness. ❤️ I believe in law and order. Law is in your name, daughter of an Australian.😅
Anyone in 2024 ?
I have SLE, it's not fun to say the least. Most modern guns are semiautomatic. I have a shotgun that is and it's crazy fun to take to my gun range.
Colorado Springs in my mind = Joe Kenda 🤣 and he did this case lol
Nah the hair is styling tho fr
calling 230k a small town 😭😭 my states LARGEST city has a population of 211k. I live in the second largest city, it’s 135k. my friend is from a town of 200 people 😭
I saw this story on homicide hunter and it was a crazy story love you Bailey
Yeeessss hair is bomb❤
Will you marry me I love your personality 😅❤😊
You are so pretty and smart you rock!
STILL on my bailey binge😆 all i’ve done this weekend is watch mm&m videos💗
Your the best friend of the true crime community. I’m just a new fan. I am the man that walks alone and when I’m walking a dark road. 😂 I feel a little anxious 😥 a little scared 😱
Funny enough people are always getting caught up by being in public with the side piece in Colo. Spgs., everybody knows each other one way or another unless they just moved there from CA
Why don’t you do it yourself you little bishhh…spray spray 😂 I’m dying
That could be why they let her out so early...🙄 If the Dr s said she's only got so long so live...🤷
Haha, you said “slapping meats”😂
I'm so glad that I rediscovered Bailey 💜 I love listening to her and giggling at her commentary. She is definitely different from other story tellers on YT
Bailey's humor is superr🎉
No one can tell story like you , you to catch my attention, and poor wife RIP 😢
Suddenly brian knocks on bailey's door😂
Sounds like a lifetime movie to me
Maybe she should go to Colorado Springs and have a nice 'chit-chat' with homicide hunter Lt. Joe Kenda! I'd pay to see that one!
i kid you not, its 2024 and im rewatching mmmm series for the 4th time hehehe. id never get bored of this
Watching in 2024!
Ey Bailey Bailey?? Are you okay?  It sounds like yo are transitionng from one place to another...even you pronounsations are totally out of sorts ??? Almost like you are a toddler??? Please explain..u r scaring me...😢
Cant stand corrupted christians 💀 (im a catholic dont come at me)
I was born and raise in Colorado Springs! 😮 Btw, love you Bailey!
I can see why the husband would have given her a single action revolver. I had a neighbor that had a revolver and a glock and he told his wife to carry the revolver because it was easier to shoot because you dont need to be as accurate and best in situations of self defense.
I don't understand was the original plan to frame the victims husband's lovers husband 🤔💬 cuz that would have tooking care of both cheating spouse's other halfs...
"Bryan, come on in" got me in shooktthhghhkjjsjshsy
I always am very torn on these kind of trials because yes, he may have manipulated her, but LISTEN she wanted him and she still went through with it and killed someone. She was a grown woman who knew right from wrong
Anyone from the Manson family NOT guilty ? Ehhh...no...everyone is...no excuses.
Sounds to me like he used spiritual abuse to brainwash her. Obviously not a true christian. I hope the churches near him have enough wisdom to keep him out, especially out of their leadership positions and spheres of influence because evil posers like him do not change.
I saw this one on id the show called homicide hunter with Lt. Joe Kenda
“Slapping meats together”
December 2023 anyone? I watch bailey religiously as I am fascinated by true crime. I think Baileys story and personality is so loveable and interesting. Always provides great content and seems to be a wonderful human.
Me who lives in CO springs : ShitshitshIT!
springs is unfortunately not a nice cute lil town😭
I'm sorry, if people could hear her screaming did they not at least call 911??
Whether there were clues or not this was a Joe kenda case so I knew it was going to be solved❤🎉
Colorado springs is probably the only place in the world where people might not seem suspicious and have a legitimate reason to wear army fatigues and ski masks . Lol and great job using a fairly unique gun in a town full of soldiers and gun experts lol. and just guessing that there had been a backpack with a change of clothes where the combat clothes were found. Because a tiny woman is the only person who would stand out in army fatigues back then. And why did the cops not think that a thing small person completely covered up might be a woman?
😂 Bailey I swear your humor is top notch 👌
I remember this one it's truly sad forgus wife and kids . Bailey the fact that I have heard this story multiple times you said it best 👌 😊
She started showing remorse when she realized that man was throwing her under the bus!
Listening while I do my makeup lol
it was  the  mistress that shot her
He did this story
Tricked how? I never understand these people who k*ll someone so they can “be together.” It’s like the whole “if they cheat with you they’ll cheat on you” thing. What happens when they want to be with someone else? What happens to you? Huh? HUH?
Oh Yeah! Jennifer's husband certainly dodged a bullet...or maybe 4...depends if his peacemaker was gonna be involved.
I had just resubscrib.  I am watching them over again.  I love listening to Bailey. She is beautiful.
This is the same time and place my parents started dating and when my dad went to the academy
I was born and raised here. We don't like be called a small town 😅. Loved your story telling thank you Bailey!
I guess the vow in sickness and in health doesn't matter to that dude. 🙃
no red pinky nail lol
He didn't want to give her a gun she could use on him :)
They often let terminal illness prisoners out so they don’t have to pay for the end of life care and burial stuff
Am sick of  people especially influencer community thinking g it's fine to bash and make fun of religions. It is very disrespectful.  I've followed you since the beginning and tired of it. You disappointment me.
Its people like him that make Us Christians look bad 😭😭
Happy Thursday 🎉🎉🎉Brooklyn 32:30
Idk if him taking out an insurance policy out on his wife is really that weird though considering she was sick. I mean that could have been something they decided together incase she was to pass away before him. Idk I'm just saying.
I live in the Springs that’s what us locals call it. Super beautiful very friendly people a bit of a country home feel. We are a military cop town and yes home to Air Force bases and an Army base and the Air Force Academy. Occasionally you will also see Marines. And we got NORAD and lots of churches
Bailey should do a video on the one and only CANDY MAN (Dean Corell, that boy is worse than John Wayne Gacy and possibly Jeff D and I don't mean Jeff Dunham)
Bailey's so funny, "maybe that's why they call it the peace maker" (giiiiirrl  and duuuude, whomever sees this) they call the Peace Maker the Peace Maker because after it's used (especially on a human being) there's nothing left but tranquility and peace
Maaaan, is it just me or is Bailey's theme song simply awesome?
I really want you to do Shelley Knotec!!
Please cover the story of jonBenet  ramsey!!!
Love you Bailey 💕
Speaking of Colorado Springs, you gotta watch Homicide Hunter: Joe Kenda. He was a detective in Colorado springs from sheesh the late 80s until the early 2010s. You would love the stories he tells. I have thought about commenting this on the past few videos I saw but this one is perfect cause it's the same town he's from😋
the MELENDEZ BROTHERS
We see iiaoopswa
Girl you need to have more respect for the dead. You joking around like this all the time is uncalled for. Be more serious. It’s disrespectful and get to the point quicker
If you keep using bad words, I can just see you accidentally saying one in front of a preacher. My sister did that once.
I think he died
Slappin meats together..  literally crying right now 😂
Martha Stewart’s in trouble again.
I would love ❤️ to hear about O.J from Bailey…
Why is it most true crime women are either missing a polished nail or blinking code? Who are you signaling to & why?
"Yeah ... Jen and Ben" 🙄😂
I always love how these adults go all nuts and don't even think about their children. - The kids are always like 👁👄👁
It is considered a military town. It has an Army base and two Air Forces bases.
“It’s not like it’s a high rollers club!” 😂😂
When or if are the murch store going to be restocked I would like to place an order, please?  😢😢😢😢😢😢
This case is crazy
What creeps me out ,all the time,is WHY ,murderers ,after arrest ,are SMILING. It has to be genetic,can't figure this out. It is creepy,creepy,creepy guys!
they both should of got life
You should look into the starvation heights story  Super interesting and so sad.
I’m sorry but I freakin scared my kids the way I cackled at “slapping meats together” 😂
Slapping meats together 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Men.
Are we in Clue??😂😂😂😂
I genuinely believe Brian was equally culpable if not more so in a lot of ways i think a part of her got caught up in the excitement and she just gave into the fantasy of it all.  But he definitely shouldve got at least an equal sentemce and in fairness if Jen had a lawyer present when confessing she likely wouldve got a plea deal for cooperation. -- also as far as the victims family taking Brian's side they likely were for one also being manipulated by his Christianized manipulation style as believers themselves and on top of that they had 3 kids her family likely felt if they didn't take his side he'd never allow them to see the kids again😢
Nobody considers their children and the consequences of their actions and how their actions effect their poor children 😢
The gun was the most popular of it's day. Wyatt Earp, Billy the kid, doc Holliday, and Jesse James all used it. The most popular was buffalo bill Cody who used it in all his wild west shows. He gave the nickname the peacemaker because he said it was "divinely accurate" allowing it's victim to make their peace with their maker.
✨science✨
Is it just my impression or are there many cases like this in Colorado?
loved your makeup in this one
Compassionate parole...your pretty much on hospice and they don't want to clean up the mess
I absolutely love you Bailey. I listen to u at night at work. This & dark history, sis people are crazy & as long as it makes sense to them they run with it.
I liked how Paris and Nicole did the theme song 😂
used to live there, evil energy. worst place ever
Both are to blame
Definitely Bryan should've been equally to Blame ❤🎉
definitely was not expecting bailey to say this happened in my city LOL
I do miss your comments on the makeup and how you like the product.
I always assumed the gun was called peacemaker because, well, shooting someone dead is one way to end a dispute 😅 but that’s always just been my guess I have also never looked into it. Just a morbid kind of cheeky
Love, love, love Bailey.
"...after they just got done slappin' meats together". Omfg 💀💀💀
as someone who has lupus you did amazing explaining it so people will undestand
It's literally called the “peacemaker”😂 great job Bailey 👏🏾🥰
His hairline in that photo in the beginning gave me trust issues 🤣
Lori Vallow vibes
Jennifer had the kind of face you think you can trust, which is terrifying.
So… Boom Shaka Laka she killed Diane …what🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Slapping meats"  I lost count on my crochet project when I heard her say that. 😂😂
I think we can agree that we NEED a hair tutorial!! Pls pls. Well, I want one lol
Whats wild to me is you said there were people around when Dianne got shot... But no one tried to stop him? Or creep up and grab him and fight the gun off of him, they just let it happen? Nah, do better people.
Random but I use to live in Colorado Springs. Yup, didn’t fit in 😂.The sun is so direct I got the best tan out there lol. Also girl I noticed our hair first thing loved it
That mugshot though...
Equal
Slappin meats🤣 and I love it when you use your makeup tools as a phone hahaha...cracks me up!
You always brighten my day!
Please do a story on Alison Botha pleaseeeeeeee Bailey
Him smiling in his mug shot. Ew.  I cant belive hes out of prison!!!???!
Me a wife who’s husband is in the army and moved to Colorado Springs 5 days ago 😮
My favorite look yet Bailey!
I think it was called peacemaker because it was a law man's gun but hopefully people who used guns like that back in the day did use that time to make some kind of peace.
BAILEYYYYY pls do the story of Marie Hilley I've been begging for so long ur gonna LOVE it luv uuuu
This was an episode on Homicide Hunter!! Love it!
Sooooooo divorce=bad, but murder=good?  Ohhhhhhhh k.... makes sense.
I live on Fort Carson, so this story was really interesting!
❤❤❤
This case was an episode was on Homicide Hunter. Go Kenda
I need someone in us explain me how you can take out life insurance policy of someone before they die... Don't really understand how that works cause in Latvia life insurance is not that common
Me... in Colorado Springs like 😢
They both were equally to blame. Neither should've been released from prison. Just that smirk on his face is enough to see he deserved the same as her.
She was so tricked
As a native and long time living Colorado Springs native, you have it wrong about us
bryan watching this video 👁️👄👁️
WAIT!! I am FINALLY getting to know you as a fairly new SUB and i started to FINALLY sing along with your theme song. And you….did not?
Bro… Colorado Springs is BEAUTIFUL
love you humor ❤
This makeup on you looks absolutely gorgeous you are one flawless mama thank you for the stories
I heard criticism about Bailey doing make-up whilst telling stories  like this. She isn't the only one. To me, however they want to do it. If every channeler did it the same way it would be boring!
Research Bob Berdella. KC Butcher
😂😂🎉 you lie 😂😂😂
the mistress had the gun
i fr love watching bailey but i felt some parts were blasphemous towards the Christian faith. idk man
Me, who grew up in a town of 250 people MAX: “250,000 is SMALL???”
What happened with the kids?
Almost cried realizing this is a Joe Kenda case 😭🥲
You forgot hoodlums. Military bases are full of military brat hoodlums trying to be as rebellious as possible
Bailey! Careful, don’t talk to him! He’s probably totally into hearing his story
I may be wrong but it seems like the government lets prisoner’s out when their medical bills get high….
"Leave me out of this.. I got *miracles* to do" 😂
Don’t worry, Bails… I never quote you. I just claim your thoughts as my own mad genius 😈💭🧐😎
Colorado Springs is not cute nor charming 😂
Watching this is 2023.....2022 didn't treat us right. Booooo 😑😐
It seems obvious to me that the reason Jennifer was released from prison early was because she had cancer. Not because they felt sorry for her. They didn't want to spend their budget on her care.
And someone identified it was a woman because of the way she handled the pocketbook
❤just watching this now❤ I so miss the theme song 😢❤❤❤❤😂
Heeyyy, Colorado Springs. That's my hometwon. :o I laughed when you said it was a charming little town. It is anything but. XD
Just here in the comments to say Bailey is sooooo beautiful! I wanna wake up that fabulous!
"Let's hope that 2022 treats us right...eeeuunnnnn" 😂😂😂😂 it aged so well
FYI, Dianne's son, Jarrod, supported Jennifer's parole and forgave her just months before her death.
I've been watching for so long that I sing the theme song with you 😂😂Thank u for posting you make my mondays so much better! 🫶
Recently found this channel. I am in LOVE with Bailey! She is    a breath of fresh air in the world of crime studies  She is also very easy on the eye. A very beautiful woman.
LOL, HOPE 2023 IS 8 TRILLION XS BETTER!
They both deserve the same amount of time. He didn’t physically pull the trigger but his intentions were just as deadly.
A fiber maybe. Not a liar, doll  ♥️
I think they were going to pin it on Ben, but probably was hoping they wouldn't connect Jennifer to him.
6:07 for some reason my first thought would have been to square up with the robber 🙃 you want my purse? Come get it
Remarkable. I’m literally taking a break from writing a paper on lupus to listen to this.
Can we please just be best friends?
Do OJ SIMPSION
Ok...that was the best theme song yet
idk i love this episode my grandmother who i’m named after name was diane and she also had lupus ik jus a coincidence but it felt better jus watching lol 😂😂
"Slappin meats together" XD This had me rollin.
No man is worth throwing your life away. No woman is worth you throwing your life away.
Brian totally hired someone
Sick to read that this man's kids believe he had nothing to do with it. He had your mother killed, grow up and face the truth. These people make me sick. However I believe in Karma, for him and his dumb a** kids
Have u ever done talked about Bonnie and Clyde
I'm turnt
I sneezed when Bailey said about the husband converted to Christianity and it took me a second to realise she didn't say he converted to **insanity** No disrespect to anyone who has faith but as an atheist it did make me chuckle a little.
Both guilty as sin. So sad Jen died. NOT. Brian has some bad Karma.
Jennifer confessing to everything  Ben sitting next to her: 👁👄👁
Are we gonna talk about how Jennifer smiled for her mug shot? So sad
you are so pretty!
I've been a floral designer since 1987..We know EVERYTHING that is going on in town..you name it..we know it. It's amazing..FYI I'm in the Washington DC area so imagine a small town..lol
Where is Brian? Brian is in the kitchen! 😅
🤣🤣 Love imagining a detective saying, "look you little... kitty cats."
okay seriously you are gorgeous. ❤️
Bailey, I absolutely adore you !!!! Love watching the videos.
“Where is he now?…BrYaN! Come on in” 💀
Simple Life theme song
Love this! What foundation brush are you using?
Slapping meats!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
She tricked n hubby 😡👿
Man Jen was fine than a mf
Colorado Springs is still the worst, if anyone is wondering. lol
Hey beautiful!  You know you could do makeup tutorials. Right?
Anyone else here waiting for Brian to comment?…just me? Great.
Just found you yesterday. Been listening while I'm at work. Thank you 💜
Oh man, I'm chilling at work casually listening and she says, "colorado springs" and my heart just dropped. That's literally where I'm at right now hahahaohno
Have you done the Gabby Petito story yet??
I’m watching this in 2023, I use to go to Air Force academy sooooo yeah!
What do u use in your hair its so Healthy
Cases like this are why I’m glad I never got married!
YES BAILEY SHOUTING OUT SOME INFO ABOUT LUPUS!!!! GET THE WORD OUT THERE GIRL
Me watching this as a current Angelo state cheerleader 👀
ARRESTED TWO DAYS AFTER?? First case I heard solved this fast
Peacemaker is the name of Wyatt Earp’s gun
Best story teller ever
Oooo JENNIFER 😂
Oooooh!! A Joe Kenda Case....My Favourite Police Detective ❤️ ....On another note, I'm a lupus sufferer....It's Horrendous 🇬🇧
slappin meats
2023 ?? Anyone
Those butterfly clips for the win!
Love 💘  you bailey your my second  daughter
I definitely want a video about the cult that came to antelope Oregon. It is so wild.
I love your make up Monday mysteries I don’t wear make but I love you content & hair look pretty also love the tattoos I have a bunch too ❤️
I love how she says antiqueness with the won't you believe it attitude
It was the lover , the other women or the other men . In like 8 minutes  in to the story but it sounds like thats what that is
An unsolved case from my hometown. The victims name is Erica Frasure from Brooksville, Kentucky
I think they both deserved life. They probably wouldn't get rid of Ben since he was out the door anyway. But she got hers in the end anyway. I have lupus and it's unbelievable to live with it feels like cancer they say it's a lot like it. Except not affecting just one part of your organs it can affect anything mine has gone to the weirdest places you wouldn't think it would. Like it's ruined my complete GI system and caused me to get diabetes without any issues I have changed. So yeah it's painful and sometimes causing being bedridden at times.
me watching on Jan 2023:
“250,000- small town”      My town only having 18,000 😳
everything you say should be quoted  😌
✨✨Science ✨✨
The pause for the hair was needed 😞😞😞
Watching this on Jan 2, 2023. Last year was awful 🥹😭
Watching this in the last day of 2022  No Bailey 2022 was not kind
Bailey's so cute❤️
My 3year old daughter said she loves your clips lol
Oh this case was on Homicide Hunter! I feel like everything crazy happens in Colorado…
Your shenanigans make me smile! You're a fantastic story teller!
If there were all those witnesses, and he needed to recock the gun every time, then why did no one try to help? 💀
I feel like because he was so high up with the church all of these people are defending Brian, people can be so brainwashed by religion
Story 1:49
Confused about placement of makeup on face seems like brush strokes are just replaced
Happy New Year sweetie 2023    😃😇🤩
250,000 is small town??? the largest town in my entire county has less than 1000 ppl 🤣
Me using my mom phone
It's me tahereh from program
Bailey starting out the video hoping the year 2022 treats us right….   Here at the end of 2022…. I can safely say it has NOT treated me right at all…… please send help!!
This bish is full of humour, i always enjoyed ur videos 😂😂❤️❤️❤️
she looked like such a beautiful kind woman.
Me watching this December 2022 “ I hope 2022 treats us right “ definitely didn’t. 😭
I googled it and the “peacemaker” is named for being used to keep oneself safe and is able to be used by anyone. In this case, it seems like its not being used how it’s intended :(
The “eh” at the end of your theme song almost woke my house at 7am because i laughed out loud 💀
My name is Jennifer and you said it so many times times, I started to feel guilty 🤣
CO SPGS continues to grow..you’re not really missing much..kind of a party town..I live 3 hours from there
I’ve been watching your videos for years now.. & it’s just always came natural to also do the theme song & intro when you do it 🤣💕 & I normally skip everyone’s intros to just get into the story.. never with yours 🤣💀💗
Please never say “slapping meats” again Bailey I’m begging 🙏🏻
" I guess that's a small town" girl- 250,000 people  my home town has  1,000 people  in 2022
Hehe you're at 6.66M subs atm
This is Detective Joe Kendas Case, he has his own show called Homicide Hunter. Love this story!
..."slapping meats together"
You should do a dark history on La Llorona!!!! 👰🏻‍♀️🖤
Their mugshots are literally so creepy
I love your eyebrows natural like this so much better! IMO I can't stand those fake shiny dark clown brows😂😋
Bailey can you do the Arne Johnson case ?? The first person to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of demonic possession.
Who smiles for their mugshot? 😉
I'm surprised Jennifer could pull back the hammer on that old revolver.... like unless she's been using that thing prior I know quite a few grown men who struggle with pulling back (dropping) the hammer on even newer revolvers. They've gotta be really well broken in and the person operating it have gotta been at it for quite a while to drop it even remotely easily
Yes do this story
Why Jennifer die on my birthday 😭😭
SLAPPING MEATS TOGETHER JADLFKJ
I'm here for the theme song!!!
"I'm never prepared, I'm never prepared." Same sis
"Why don't you do it yourself then you little biiiiiitxh?!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He wore clothes underneath Make sure she was dead
Why are these two clowns 🤡🤡 smiling in their mugshots!? What are you so happy about, you got caught! 🙄😂
I would love to see your take on that woman who killed her kids during Covid. They made a documentary on her, sins of our mother on Netflix.
My son hears the theme song and wakes right up with a huge smile 🥰😂 we love Bailey (ps he is only 9 mo old 😅)
“Are we in clue” literally what I thought
Sounds like they planned to blame Ben
🥳🙈🙉💞🙊💔💫💥☻️💤💤💤💤💤💭🗯💅
My little sister just got diagnosed with lupus 😔
Bailey: look at my hair isn't is so cute!! I did it,  proceeds to pterodactyl screech.  😂😂😂 my favorite reaction ever!!
I stumbled across your page by chance on FB.  And now I'm hooked.  Awesome job.  When you said "slapping meats" I lost it.  And I'm watching at while at work, my co-workers told me to calm down.  But I've been laughing for about 10 minutes.  Also, love it when you use your make up containers as a phone.  Keep up the videos.
Can you do a episode on Sam Parker former police officer in Lafayette Ga who k*lled his wife it took over 3 years to solve or the tri state crematorium were Brent marsh didn’t actually give out the ashes of the loves ones who died just random ashes until it was discovered by the walker county sheriffs office
Redbull today, or aderol? 😂
Why please Why do you feel the need to make these stories about you, with the layers of make up and thumbnails. I no you think more guys will click, but to any decent man its off putting. It shows how insecure a person is, and how they need attention. If princess diana had a ghost story you would spend an hour doing your make up just to put a giant selfie of you in the thumbnail rather than the beautiful diana. Its not just you but it needs to stop. You girls are making serious  money from the details of peoples deaths, some who still have family alive. All the while making the video more about you, at least have a little respect if you lack decorum .
Could you talk about Theresa Knorr, the evil mom that abused and killed her two daughters Sheila and Suesen Knorr??
About the peacemaker, the reason it’s called a “peacemaker” is because anyone of any size could wield the weapon. So both petit men and women could defend themselves from attackers of larger size, in this case i think Jennifer’s husband gave her the gun as its the most suitable for her … unfortunately it was used wrongly
She seems less energetic in this video, I hope she rests well for as long as she needs, and takes care of herself.
Every time you say Jennifer I'm like "I DIDN'T DO IT 😭 " 😂
The best last theme song😔
The police: yay
BRUH NOT IN MY HOME TOWN. NO. NOPE.
I love how you do your makeup you look beautiful and love your hair.. I also like the stories you share with us.. I learned allot about these stories and my heart goes out to all the families .. ❤
You have got to be f'ing kidding me
I was always brought up to believe that adultry was a SIN
i love bailey because i just love how she tells story's and I love her humour
This story reminds me of the game Love,Sam. Not completely the same but I can see some similarities.
Have you done jamie osuna?
This story sounded so familiar! When I heard this happen in Colorado Springs I knew it was a Joe Kenda case ! I absolutely love how Bailey tells the story !
it's crazy to me to think of the Springs as small... but regardless, this is the kind of case that makes the world seem small! yikes, dude.
why is jennifer bad
The original Benifer!
Hi Alec Baldwin? Same type gun.
Your makeup is awesome and I love 💕 the way you tell the story thank you
BAILEY, you are so awesome!!!!!  I love the intro song, am I the only one that it reminds me of Family Feud?? 🤣
When she brought up “Peacemaker,” my mind went to Wyatt Earp’s gun.  Make your peace.
Victim time to make peace with his maker
I think the whole objective of Jen and Brian is to take out both Dianne and Ben. They tried to frame ben as well but they didn't succeed.
Lol I was born there in 01 😂
i ABSOLUTELY LOVE your site...
Wait I live right next to that University
I think travis wasn’t as innocent, he had a long enough history of her behaviour to know she was off, but kept going back and hooking up with her…I can’t find any sympathy for men who play these games
Was it The Mistress
I think the plan was probably to get rid of both of them but she ended up getting caught up because her husband went in and told them about the gun and he had the life insurance so that they could have money and live it up with both of them out of their way. And I think they both needed to have an equal sentence and he should have gotten Man one
Lupus runs in my family, it’s terrible 😭
How does she get het lips to look fuller with her makeup on? I’m jealous
This was an episode of homicide hunter with Joe Kenda. I actually grew up in colo spgs know exactly where all this happened.
Pen fifteen
Jennifer died on my birthday
It’s never Gods will to be with another woman’s husband and cheat on your spouse…
I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1990. My dad was in the Air Force and literally a month after I was born they moved to Atlanta Georgia. So this is interesting. Kind of hits closer to home, at the same time, kind of not but I do feel a little bit different about the hearing this story than all the other ones.
The Peace Maker was What Erps gun!!!!!
I think the reason why they released Jennifer because they knew she would not live long, plus her cooperating with the police during the investigation. Once you have pancreatic cancer, your chance of survive is about 3-5% if I remember correctly.
Very interesting video! Love your coverage of cases Bailey!
I went to Angelo state! Love that you mentioned it!
Seems a little sus since he was talking about this with his friends. Sad story for Dianne. :(
21:10 lmafo.....so predictable crazy karens...
13 min and 36 seconds in I'm calling it the lover did it with her daddy's gun lol let's see if I'm right
I watched this episode of homicide hunter w luitenant joe kinda😍
Slapping meats together
Have you done the Jessica sacco and the pos who killed her?
i have lived in co springs for 12 years now, and it’s a pretty big town despite the population. even tho it’s a crime story it’s cool to hear a story about my hometown because it’s typically overlooked (bc of denver) and a decent/well taken care of city imo
Peacemaker????!! That’s Wyatt Earps gun
I am a colorado native and never heard of this wow but Colorado Springs is beautiful you should come visit!!
Sounds like Brian is a cult leader
They both needed life
Gary ridgeway
We need a O.J. Simpson
Why didn't they just run fingerprints on the inside of the gloves??
Poor kids😓...on both sides...why no one thinks about their own kids...?
How do I get theme song as my ring tone?
Can we get a hair tutorial please?:)
I fu<kin love you!!!  The amount of genuine laughs you give me with your commentary, sarcasm, and impeccable humor…  🤌🏼👩🏼‍🍳💋 Thank you for being you, biiiiotch!  😘
"I've got miracles to do."😂
NO NO NO PLEASE DO THE FRITZL CASE ITS SO SCARY BUT THERE’S no in depth explanation and there no one other than Bailey who can do this story in my opinion There’s a series adaptation but I think it’s entertainment driven @baileysarian
I miss these videos...
idk someone who smiles in their mug shot is totally guilty...
Last episode featuring the theme song 💔😥
Hi Bailey..we need your version on the story of Teresita Basa. ❤️
I love how she tells a story
Not me living 2 hours away from springs
@Bailey.   BRIAN IS DEAD.
I like your idea that someone has had time to "make peace" except in this case!! Jen was definitely manipulated, Brian should have got life, his wife sure did!! SCUMBAG!!!¡
Theme song will never get old lol
Girl, I just love you. Your commentary is awesome
Ilysmmmmmmmm😙
Just Commenting for the algorithm 😃
Not me watching back on all the videos just to hear the theme song 💔
You should look into la madrina
The peacemaker was Wyatt Earp's gun .
I’ve known about your podcast for 3 weeks & now it’s all I watch on my spare til & at work 🤣
As someone with lupus I must say, please just divorce me. If I can make it to a support group I can make it without you 😀✨
I'm still dying for you to do the Susan Powell story 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Bring back MMM please.
The fact that she was smiling so big in her mugshot….creepy
Just watched this on Joe Kenda, Homicide Hunter.  Oddly enough.. he now lives, Joe Kenda,  not far from me.
You are awesome I just love your personality beautiful
I miss the theme song 🥺🥺
Peace Maker allows time for the person to be shot to make peace with themself.
It makes me crazy when people call themselves a Christian and then reshape God's word to fit thier wants and narrative.   Major eye roll!!  And as a Christian, pastor's daughter, etc., etc., I have seen it a lot.
I'm pretty positive that The Peacemaker was named by/after Wyatt Earp when he became a peace officer. .my youngest is named after him🥰 ..also, love ur channel 🖤💜
I would have taken that gun. In a heart beat
I dunno about 1990, but last time I lived in Colorado Springs, it was not a quaint little town...lol. I mean, maybe Manitou Springs!
👑💝💓💘💕💖💞🌺
Yeaaa I’m 1 hr from Colorado Springs🖤 it large now 🙏🏻
I must know WHERE do you get those candles in the background!?? Are they fake? Real? I wants!!   PS. I LOVE your channel! ✌🏼
Please do the girl in Plainville
2022 did not treat me well this is the worst year of my life 🤪
Sounds to me like they were 50/50. She probably deserved the sentence that she got, but he should’ve had a heavier one to match hers.
I want her to do my makeup
@BaileySarian I'm sure you hear this often..We all miss MMM..*IOP..( I'm posting this for my several coworkers & myself).. Dark History is not as interesting as MMM.✌✌ We've all been watching you bf MMM💚🤍🤍💚
Please keep this exact theme song.... forever.🥺 🙏
Has she done Diana Downs ?
“Slapping meats together” 😂😂😂 Bailey I’m dead 💀
Richard speck
I felt like I was in trouble the entire time with how you kept saying Jennifer! lol great episode :)
“Slapping meats together” really took me out 💀😭😭🤣
This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I don't think Bryan should have been charged at all. I dont believe in punishing people for trying to convince other people to commit crimes, because ultimately those people made the conscious decision to listen to them and commit a crime. This is basically punishing someone for speech.   Now there are certain cases that might be an exception, such as the person being influenced being a child or mentally disabled or hindered in some way, but generally i feel like punishing people for suggesting or trying to convince someone to commit a crime is wrong and sets the precedent that the person who actually committed a crime isnt 100% accountable, which is inaccurate. The only person who should be punished in a crime is the person who committed the crime. That's it.
Hey yeah nobody Is perfect let alone your the most honest and real person on YouTube
I’m sorry, you can get guns at Walmart?!
Please tell me im not the only one who sings the theme song with her 😅
March 24th is literally my birthday
5:08 foreshadowing much? 😂
I need a Bailey inspired “kickin it for Jesus!” Shirt
Actually if you get robbed what you should do is throw whatever object the robber is trying to take away from you, to direct the attention away from you and give you a moment to get away.
Slapping meats together 😂😂😂
Why wouldn't the witnesses try and do something to stop it?
Okay but why are they both smiling in their mug shot
It’s super funny that you think 250k city is a small town. 😂 I live in a town that is 17k. What would you call that? 😂😂😂
Every time u say Jennifer it shakes me 😅
I live in Colorado and have never heard about this story, so thanks for coverage but totally love everything you cover 💕
If anyone is able to find out Diane's old address, I am curious if they lived near by my family before we moved.
It's super weird hearing you describe Colorado Springs because I was born there and we moved away I guess a year before this happened, but I was super little so I have like... 2 or 3 memories from there.
**Video request** Bailey, can you please do a video on the lady ( Missy Beavers) who was killed in the early morning hours @ her church in Texas while getting ready to do a exercise class. The person who killed her was on video dressed in fake police type attire & was covered from head to toe. Her husband was on a fishing trip when this occurred. Tks✌
It's giving Trump worshipping christian vibes ✨
It’s never lupus lol
It’s called the peace maker bc it’s what law men used to carry and they were called peace officers. But I like your train of thought lol
the peacemaker was wyatt earps gun, he was sheriff in a few places a long time ago, last place was Tombstone I think, you know he kept the peace :)   He was in the famous gun battle at the ok corral also.   Scifi did a cool show main character was his granddaughter Wynona Earp (also name of show) the peacemaker was her inheritance and it was a special gun that killed revenants (demons), you'd probably like it should see if you can still watch it you'll like it.
Bailey, I would love to hear you do a video on the West Memphis 3? It's such a messed up case, and so sad.
Haha You said my name so many times in this video I felt like my mom was getting mad at me :P
So it was the husband!!!! Lol
The system is a joke
🥰
Don't I just love your way of narrative 🥰🥰🥰
I've lived in CO springs my WHOLE life.... How did I not know about this case????
Something crazy.. I’ve been listening to your podcasts since sophomore year every day in school.. and I just found out who you are senior year!
So I know that this comment is a bit late, but first I have to say your videos are awesome. And to start since this “Peace Maker” is one of the main themes of this story. I thought I could give you some insight. So as a firearm enthusiast and collector I know that now days the latest “Peace maker” sold for a bit over $200k, and back in the 70s and 80s it was worth about $75k-$100k. Because this gun is so expensive is because it was used by the military and by the law that is mostly why it’s called the “Peace Maker” because it killed a lot of bandits. So anyways to wrap up back then that was still quite a bit of money and maybe if this was a high classed collector or a 65 yo retired man then idk how he would have afforded this highly valuable item. Ok keep up the great work and yeah.
I love the theme song. Wish she’d bring it back!! It’s adorable
You did a great job on your hair!
What’s Audrey ll doing
Please
Oj
I love this look,Bailey!  As far as the case goes I think both should of received life no parole .
Oh em gee. I love love this look girl. The butterfly clips and all. 🤌💯
Missing person story on Tara Calico in Belen, NM
i bet a bajillion dollars that brian offered the insurance money for the bil's testimony
i honestly don’t think they would’ve gone after Ben too, because they were already going to get divorced or were separated idk idk
My family and I lived in Colorado Springs for a couple years (a few years back). For her to say it’s a town is funny cuz I always thought of it as a city lol
Crazy I’m from Angelo🫣
I just love her little theme song lol
Both should have gotten life without the possibility of parole
8:36 so they found the whole outfit, did they not found a single DNA trace or whatever?? Did they even run a DNA test/swab for DNA?
And here I am watching this after Roe v.  Wade gets overturned
Wait what happened to the kids?
Hahaha!  My daughter’s name is Jenn and her husband is Ben!  Hmmmm….
UGH ADS!!!!
That justification is the biggest stretch ive ever heard
I'd like to know what's going on in the disappearance of Jodi Huisentruit,  Mason city Iowa, June 27, 1995
True Crime be like: "Boom Shaka Lacka. Case closed.... Right? Well... No. Yes, nay nay. But, no. But, yes."
Can you check out the Gary Ridgeway case :0 please and thank you!!
She went from Bennifer to Brennifer....
Dose anyone watch homicide hunter with Joe kenda cause I believe this is one of his cases and I know Bailey won't see but if she dose Bailey you should watch it
Could you look into the case of Kimberly  Moreau from jay maine?
Can you do a show on Brent marsh who owned the tri state crematorium in noble ga or Sam Parker in Lafayette ga who killed his wife and it took over 3 years to figure out your show absolutely amazing me and my wife watch it every Monday
Also can you do the makeup and The johnny depp trail? lol pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I have been watching your makeup and story telling for years now. I am so glad more people can appreciate your content. Do you ever do makeup tutorials?
I believe Joe Kenda was the investigator on this one.
I so don't understand makeup. 😕 I think I paid more attention to the makeup than the story lol 😆 😅
Wyatt Earp famous cowboy best friend with Doc Holiday, had a gun named peacemaker
But just imagine for one moment, Brian actually watching this from his apartment in like Sacramento or something, laughing at the way you said "Brain... Sweetie...u rly should go back to prison..."
These are the most cringe videos Ive ever came across 🤡💀
My puppy is watching with me like 2 seconds of the video he’s a hunting dog mix I rescued .
Bailey I'm telling u- you make my day NY life the way u said "Brian come on in 😄"
Firearm like a revolver has a hammer and a firearm like a 9 mm has a firing pin maybe removed the hammer may not. Just a Lil food for thought
Okay. Why are they smiling in their mug shots 😂
Watching from co springs 😬 lol All the Mila families here hardly are church goers; bunch of young military men who just lie and cheat and go to all the bars that serve them well😅
I think Brian was definitely more involved than he was claiming. I wonder if it was Jennifer’s idea to get rid of Diane and Brian agreed and told her how to do it.
Are you srs? They had witnesses and nobody stopped the man? LIKE NOBODY?
I’m from San Angelo, TX where ASU is!
You always make me laugh 😃
Wow
I hate when they do all the cliched things like the life insurance thing, like come on, have some originality.
Bailey baby please make that scream you did after “I did it” be an intro 😹💚
As soon as Bailey said “5’6 and thin” I knew it was woman this time
Lol the little screech she did in the beginning woke up my baby 😂🥲
Finding this video while driving home from CSCO😂
Baily is terrific. She is so intelligent in her remarks. I hope she remains succsesful.
Your so cute seriously I look for your videos just cause of how you report the case
fuxking bystanders🤮
You make my day 💕
Brian is so creepy in his mugshot
Who... Calls a gun a PEACE MAKER
The theme song NEVER gets old. It’s my favorite part of each episode. 💙
I think jennifer and bryan made an agreement to get rid of diane and to split the insurance money ....
Has she done Natalie Woods' story yet?
I love the theme song get it Bailey!
I just hope that the kids of the two marriages were fine :c
Hey Lieutenant Kenda musta been the Homicide Detective!
“i could google it but i like my assumption better” same girl 😂
When i miss the theme song I just go back to these videos 😅
Slapping meats 😂
You are so cool . I love your song and your funny wee sayings . Thankyou for being part of my bedtime routine . Love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 x
Trying to find a link to this case you’re covering, in the description but it’s just the makeup
Yeah opening music
Towns that house military bases are not "cute and small" lol
Anyone else hear the theme song everytime she says 'Jennifer'...or is it just me ?
Probably nobody manipulated anyone and both of them were into in the same intensity
If Bailey would ever conduct a quiz about all her MMM stories I would ace it lol
SuOkay Okay DusOkay iuOkay iuI’m you got us say stuuuyfsf
Your lips in this are EVERYTHING!! I love the color!!
I had to rewatch this vid because I believe this was the last time I heard you do the theme song and I missed the theme song Love you Bailey anyways carry on girl
Happy that the "themesong" is still going strong! 😁
And of course in the 1800s they named a gun that kills things and people, the peacemaker.
Also I love that you use Trixies products
✨✨✨😎🤙🏽✨✨✨✨✨🥰🥰🥰🥰✨🔥🔥🔥✨✨✨😍
What’s this case called.
My name is Jennifer and I kept feeling like I was in trouble when she said my name!  I didn't do it, Bailey!
Both guilty. Too short of a sentence!
The gun is called a peacemaker because it quote "makes peace"... i.e. shuts up the person disturbing the peace. Any gun can often be referred to as a "peacemaker", but that gun has the original title of peacemaker.
I audibly gasped when she said Colorado Springs as that’s where I live hahaha
If someone is in prison, the prison system is required to pay for all medical expenses... The governor most likely pardoned her so the state didn't have to pay for her chemo treatments. Prisoners are expensive.
bailey talking in 3x speed at the start
Bryan may not have pulled the trigger, but he deserved a longer sentence.  His girlfriend deserved a longer sentence too but it doesn't matter since she died.
You’ll have to come here (Colorado Springs)for a visit. Beautiful area.Lots of tourist spots and , aside from the military presence, the Olympic training center is here. Population is around 700,000 now and growing.
Yes, Brian is in the wrong for the affair. Tisk tisk. But the life insurance could have been a literal random thing. It could have been that they took the policy out after she found out she had lupus, in fear that she would be at a higher risk of something more fatal. I could see someone manipulating the system, by trying to take someone else down with them that wasn't physically there. You can prove that he wasn't physically there, but It's difficult to prove that you weren't conspiring together. So I'm very torn on that one.
So sad. What happened to their children, im sure they are now all adults and have watched this story.
Bailey, you are the BOMB girl!!!!! Feel better.
hoestly looking for dates when you last did the theme. missing this part on your latest vid
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Can we get a hair tutorial pls 🥲
Love the sass and theme song
Let’s all appreciate the last time we hear the most famous theme song ever 😢 still love you so much though Bailey!
Oooh I know this case from habitually watching Homicide Hunter: Lt. Kenda!
It's very hard to know that your daughter is gone, moreover, the case wasn't covered by the police, and didn't care about it that much. This case is about Jawaher Haji. We need your voice to reach the police. Please help us! Her mom is now broken! I know you have a big heart to help us. Thank you and we wish to recover this case and make a hashtag to reach our voices!💔
Please cover the story of Jawaher Hajji.
جواهر إختفت بليز يا بيلي قدمي المساعدة
Hi Bailey  Hope you are okay? I am from Birmingham  United Kingdom  I am wondering if you do any true crime stories in other countries? Wondering if you do would you be able to do one about  'The milk carton kids'  It's about two boys who went missing in Birmingham 1996.  There are many people digging up woodlands atm, this all happened due to a telly documentary that did a story about them. I am trying to help get info.   We was the same age when they missing and want to help. Thank you for your time reading this Sam
Please cover the story of Jawaher Hajji
It always baffles me to hear 250,000 people considered a small town. My town only just hit 1,000 people. 😂
Never understood this system where someone can take out life insurance on someone else. I understand if someone takes out insurance on themselves so that in case they die their children are okay or something like that. But taking out insurance on someone else's life? I remember reading at one point that there was a person who some people took out life insurance on and that he tried to take it off but couldn't, so he was constantly fearing for his life. Can someone from the US explain to me how this works and why it is allowed?
You: 1990 Me: Oh no! lots of bad things happened that year! (I was born that year) You: Oh yeah! We are going there! Me: hahaha
On a side note: can you link your hair clips Bailey?
As an Air Force Veteran Bailey, the Colorado Springs Air Force Academy would mean “Air Force” folk 🤔 not so much “Army” folk probably 😁
Great energy today!!! Hugs
I think Brian should have gotten life w/o parole.
I love you!!! You remind me so much of my Daughters. I see them in you ;)
Me: FULL ON CRACKING UP at the husband's response to where he was. Bailey: *snickers* its not funny.
"Slapping meats" 🤣🤣🤣. For real though, he should've got life also.
This case is also an episode of The Homicide Hunter S2 E1 on Hulu.
She is so funny!
"Slapping meats together" killed me. I couldn't breathe. 😂 💀
No one:  Me : I’m here for the 🍿 🤤 ☕️ and the jokes/impressions 😂.   She’s O F F I C I A L L Y my favorite and ❤️
I’d like to hear about all the pedo’s like elvis presley, Harvey Weinstein ,Jeffrey Epstein jerry Lee lewis ,joe biden , Quincy jones all the rest of the hundreds of them that are involved with the (pizza gate) underworld child sacrifices many won’t believe ooooh but it’s soooooo true!!! Sadly
There is many ways to manipulate people you can litterly idolize someone that express a huge desire for  something , you can feel compelled to that and do it too I don't think that his word was taken and since is very easy to blame the husband for litterly everything it all went like that but and honestly wanting someone dead is still not a crime taken a life insurance on a family member is still not a crime I wish you would've talked or expose more evidence that actually place him in that spot as the one to blame and I actually think that 30 years was way too much for a said manipulation out of just and only suspects.
I went to Angelo State University. That threw me when you said that.
Love the theme song!!!!!
Could u do videos on _Frank Delano Floyd_ and _Dennis Nilsen_ please. They both are sick af! They would make great video subjects tho, being that they are: Just! The! Worst! Thank u!
They are making a movie about this
I was going Noggin Noggin NOGGIN
Question 🙋🏻‍♀️ what is that the thing she using to put her baking powder on under her eyes ???
I shoot peeps all the time with my peacemaker from the hubs! It’s the only gun I wanna own. ;) Bailey you are awesome!!!! @ love love love ya
i make friends through Bailey Sarian videos, we are talking about it right now at work, we are huge fans!!!
he smiled in his mugshot... that's the kicker for me
Please do a story on David Maust
What happened to the theme song? I love it 😀 😍 ❤
Karma did Her job…Jennifer got what she deserved. Brian is a coward of a man and belongs behind bars.
Have you looked into the case of Ella Blackwood?  Love your show my wife and I watch all the time!😁
i watch your vids alot , you started to sound like Marge Simpson to me hahahha <3
May I ask how the theme song arose? Did it just randomly ck.e along or is there a reason behind it? 😂
Love you Bailey 💕
I’m from the springs. We are also home to the Olympic training center! Love you! ❤
Love you Bailey. This is right in my neighborhood, Colorado Springs is a great town, I moved here from Orlando FL. Over 5 years ago. You should come visit sometime , you will always have a friend here in the Springs just lmk. Me, my boyfriend and my friends would make you feel at home. Would love to pay you back for all your awesome stories you share. Thanks
As soon as u said it wasn’t the husband. I knew it was the husbands mistress 😭
FLAWLESS makeup and story telling 😩😩 I’m addicted for like 2 years now 😂
She was so manipulated by Brian and he should have been convicted just as hard as she was.
Hi!  Long time listener, first time caller here... Will you tell the Kurt Cobain story?  Thanks for all the uploads.  I love this channel!
i absolutely love your bare face. you are so gorgeous
Hi Bailey! I know we're in your personal business all the time, but here iam about to ask you a personal question. You have such flawless skin, I wonder if you wear makeup everyday? You don't have any wrinkles and your skin is like glass. I do remember when  you fought with some kind of acne? Earlier in your YouTube days. I guess I'm curious as to your beauty routine. If you don't mind sharing, please do. Thanks so much! I'm a huge fan. BTW, your story telling ability is amazing. I see big things in your future. Like maybe broadcasting? Think big, Bailey! The world can be yours! :)
So I said to myself, "Self—" and I knew it was me cuz I recognized the voice...
I just discovered your channel a few days ago and I LOVE YOU! I find myself randomly singing your theme song throughout the day, too hahaha
She wasn't manipulated
No death sentence to the women
it’s kinda funny because she asked her boyfriend for a gun and he gave the mosh crapiest one 😂
Definitely should have gotten the same sentence and she was 100% manipulated
A life insurance policy on someone with Lupus isn’t quite the same as all these other idjits who take one out on a spouse right before they take them out. That said I don’t know a single company who would cover someone with a chronic illness and would cover even accidental death by firearms
I remember this case! I believe Joe Kenda solved it!
Florist came in clutch  for this case
So crazy I was born and raised in Southern Colorado and my mom also has lupus
A great story would be the Sabrina Limon case
My partner said it was called a peacemaker because back then they were only issued to police men hence the “peacemakers”
Dr house says it’s never lupus lol
Bailey could make hour long tutorials on how to unclog a toilet and id watch the entire thing- personality is top NOTCH😭
Love Dark hair on you....you look like sleeping beauty.
Lil diddy,, bout a woman named Diane
Actually, a revolver is generally very reliable and I prefer it for self defense. Jam your pistol once in a panic and you'll be paranoid and buy a revolver. lol. I probably wouldn't go with an antique Peacemaker... But in Colorado, it would be harder to have a gun at all... Maybe not at the time, though... IDK what the laws looked like then...
I have lupus
Because of this podcast, I now study Chem and Forensics. Bailey, you are awesome.
I was born on ft Carson military base in 93. I was still a baby when my parents moved home but my mom said Colorado Springs was a beautiful place. It’s on my bucket list to go back and visit there!
Thank you for cheering me up after a long day at work :)  Your such a star ♥️
Every time I watch your videos I feel like it's you & me talking. Lol. Like nobody else around! I don't have friends Bailey. literally! But looking your videos feels like I have one. Thank you bestie. Please take care yourself as well. Take easy in life coz I know you're probably stress.
Why are the both smiling in the mug shots!? CREEPOS
Whenever I hear Bailey doing the theme song I feel sad….like this era always felt a little forced, and it all makes sense now. Go you Bailey! As long as you are true to yourself, that’s all I could hope and ask for. I love you queen, we are all rooting for you. ❤️

3 Air Force bases, the Air Force academy, and 1 army base. 😃
Hang on, did you say slapping meats together...? Or knees....meats is funnier...rewind...
wonder what diana's kids think about this
lets hope 2022 treats us right   *gets a war*
"That's the smoking gun."  🤣  I'm not even sure you realized what you did there.  Also, as soon as you said the gunman was 5'5" and dressed in BDUs, I immediately had the case solved and I was right!  By the way, love your hair like this!
They were both crazy , I think Ben was the brains
Discovered you last night. Love how you tell the story!
Baily in the same tone my mother used to use: Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer! Me: What I do?!
HI!!!! Miss Freda okc :-)
You said " people love joy " so I'm gonna pretend that you have picked it up from me, bc I always sign off with "POSITIVITY PEACE LOVE JOY BLISS AND RESPECT TO YOU! AHH (I'm not çrazý just excited). luv u girl
It’s my birthday and I’m watching my best gal whilst doing my birthday makeup …! What could be better?
🖤🖤🖤
Bailey please make a video on the Anita Louise Pitea  cold case. Thank you ! Love you
Hmmm. But getting a diagnosis is REDICULOUS 😒😒😒
2. 22. 2022 @2pm I  GOT MARRIED!!! THANK YOU BAILEY SARION!!!!! 👰😁
You should do a story on Jeffrey Willis in Michigan
"Come on in" 😂💯❤💪🏾
can you do the case of Junko Furuta ? I've recently found the case and it needs more publicity
You should visit Colorado Springs! The air is so clean & cool there. The city isn't super small, but a lot smaller than LA. You'll love it if you love a relaxing vacations.
I found one I somehow missed!! Yaaay!! Ok now on to watch 😁
Let’s be honest, we all know why everyone sided with him and was given a lighter sentence 🙄
Isn't that where Joe Kenda did his stuff?
💖
I always hang out with my friends in the jacuzzi 😏 just kidding I don’t have friends 🥲
Thank you for saying this about lupus! A lot of people don’t understand and how fatigued you get. How medications, tests, dr.s, appointments, $$$, time you have do/loss.
Her Theme Song 😂 … I sing it to my son cause his name is Ma’Sauni … so I sing his name the way she sing her theme song “Sauni Saun Sauni Saun Sauni Saun Saun Sauni Saaaaaaaaun” 😂😂😂
U r simply Awesome 👌
If 250,000 people is a small town my town is microscopic we only have around 45,000 no hate Bailey I love you just thought that was funny 😂
Did you know your singing the let's make a deal music. 💕
Any other Jennifers out there feeling attacked? 😁
stay strapped my friends.
Yes, your hair is cute :)
Please do edjd
I love your stories. I wish I could notations in my Facebook
I have SLE lupus
this theme song 😑
I hate even just hearing the name "Jennifer" 😂🤦‍♂️ Then here comes Bailey saying the name every sentence 🙄🤦‍♂️ BM Drama 😂💯
That’s so cool you use some Trixie Cosmetics.
“Are we in Clue” 😂😂😂😂 dying
Could you look into Jane Bashara who was killed by a handyman?
honestly.. i think they were equally involved. i believe jennifers ex mother in law when she said jennifer was not one to be manipulated, and im convinced brian was involved in the planning. i think brian and jennifer agreed miss jenny would be the one to do it so that it would be harder to relate back to them, assuming they ~thought~ they hid their relationship well. However... i find it weird ben gave jenny the peacemaker, of all things. why such a slow, not-so-beginner-friendly gun to protect herself with? and the peace maker seems like a more  valuable piece one would want to preserve, at that. I also think jennifer didnt intend to shoot dianne twice, i think jennifer was just a poor shot and got her shoulder by accident instead. If it was just a random robbery, they most likely would not ensure your death like that, they would be shooting to stop you or out of adrenaline/fear. this story was a WHIRLWIND though damb
Pero que no se supone que la descripción fisica del asesino no coincide con jennifer?
That's crazy I was literally watching homicide hunter a couple days ago, it felt like deja vu.
Bailey! You make me laugh. I finally subscribed and so glad I did.
I have been working my way through MM&M since like September Bc I just didn’t want to finish it but now I only have one left!!!!! Ugh idk how I’ll move onnnnn! So grateful I have dark history next  Bailey thank you so much for all your hard work and all you do I love you 🥺
I heard about this story on Homicide Hunter with Lt. Joe Kenda. I love his stories.
Bailey, you are cursing so much in your latest videos that I don’t even enjoy listening to them anymore. I loved the older ones though. You actually told the story as a story teller instead of saying ‘he is such a d&**’ or ‘f him’.
I'm addicted to your channel. As if I'm in the living room listening to you. Funny and entertaining 😄 Your my friend in my head 🤣
They let her out, because the prison system doesn't want to pay for her cancer bill. I've seen it, they don't make money off you if your bills cost them money.
The “let me think “ haha got me
I am annoying. But. Please do Shelly Knotek!!
It's called the peace maker based off "an armed society is a polite society" basically lol.
Canadian here: in America, people can buy guns in Walmart!  For real?   I just need to know if this is an actually thing, or if this is a "don't believe everythink you see on TV" situation.
Ur makeup is flawless!!!! I can't get my foundation to even sink into my skin! It literally breaks up and doesn't sit right odk what I'm doing wrong lol 🙃  I love true crime! ID Discovery is my favorite channel!
Homicide Hunter about Joe Kenda in Colorado Springs is my favorite all time ID show. 💜
I cannot believe you’re talking about Lupus!  I’ve had it 20 yrs & yes, it attacks the whole body.  It is your body attacking itself, you’re right.  Just had to say that!  I’m certain no one will ever read this!
Obviously a hit or a crazy mistress
You should try make a new series where you go to all the places where all the stories you have told are placed
😳👍
Jennifer, would you infer? I know you're playing games I know that's how it works....
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE BACK TO THIS AGAIN THESE ARE MY FAVORITE BEDTIME STORIES, NO LIE!! I love you Bailey! 🥰🤘🏻💜
I think it speaks volumes that her own in laws testified against her, that Brian’s brother in las took his side. The policy could have been taken on her because she was sickly. We don’t know, but it does speak volumes the two things I mentioned. Idk.
Great story Bailey. I think they were equally culpable, Jen should have received more time because she actually did the deed.
Love the Audry. " Feed me Sarian." As you throw dead bodies at us every Monday.
Mike Williams Case
Wow, dianne had health issues and seemed like a sweet person, raising their kids and Brian is out here doing everything a church leader and HUSBAND shouldn’t be doing . That was the mother of his kids. How selfish of both Jennifer and brian. shame. I hope they forever have had to think about their actions.
It seem as though they were watching her in order to know her schedule. I'm only in the middle of the story. This is so sad .
Thanks so much
Wait, So was this the last MMM with the Theme Song?! I must save forever!!!
I am a holistic healer. (Natural cures) I helped a lady whom was afflicted with Lupus and I gave her Colloidal Silver, 1/2 tsp,  3 times a day and the she told me it was no longer advancing and most of her symptoms went away. COLLOIDAL SILVER 500PPM.
2022 has to rock, because the last two years SU@#€D!
Not only I’m learning about crimes and the world I’m also learning how to do makeup from Bailey lol, luv ya Bailey♡
Bailey Sarian is a NATIONAL TREASURE!!
You are absolutely beautiful! All the makeup is unnecessary.  But I get the hustle. Love this channel. Keep it coming 🙂
Haha I love the part were she said “slapping meats”. The Husband is a horrible person and just ew.
Jennifer: Babe, babe, I need a gun Ben: Have this musket babe, its great.
I'd love to hear your account of the Daniella Vian case from Mobile, AL.
Hey there. Amazing stories and you are a fascinating person. Thank you.
The “Peacemaker” gun is actually a very famous gun model. It’s fame is linked to Wyatt Earp. He used the model in his days as a lawman!
I love your make up and super cute hair.  Looking forward to the next episode.
Love your makeup! I actually started doing some of the things you do, to my makeup. Very sad story btw. And yes they should equally be to blame.
I was wondering if you could do a you do a video on Diane Downs? My brother and I love your videos and I am really intrigued by this case!
I love you Bailey and I love seeing you come back to life you are so different now you are so much you
Because the kids lost their mother, so Diana's family felt it was harsh to take Brian away too
Adultery is literally the reason to get a divorce. He could’ve just said hey I cheated on u let’s separate. He did so many things not apart of Gods will his understanding was so messed up.
As a person apart of the Christian community we do not claim Brian and his ideology
Selena has lupus :(
Love the hairdoo! So So So adorbs!
“No mm mm...lemme think..NO”😂😂😂
my question is didn't the witnesses say the person who shot her was around 6'4. now unless that woman is very tall I don't see how it would've been her. I mean 6'4 you can tell that height that is very tall. maybe I missed something like the shoes were very tall but from what I remember it just doesn't make sense. if I did miss something lmk because I don't want to go back to find out lol.
Peace  Love Joy Yay  She's is sooooo Goofy!!!! I Love Her ;)!!!!
Really love the expressions.. I wana do this too 😩
The mugshots are so creepy…
I am so glad that I saw someone recommend you on another YT channel because I really love your remarks while telling the story, it reminds me of Mike from That Chapter and he's my fav true crime channel so I think I'm going to enjoy your videos LOL It's also kind of peaceful to watch you do your makeup.
In their own I'll-conceived & ridiculous way, I think they might actually have been trying to fit Brian up for the crime by using his gun & clothes - maybe hoping to get him locked up for life so they could sail off into the sunset...classic two birds, one stone....
I have SLE (lupus) and it goes after my Central Nervous System. For my Mom, it likes to be a biabiaaa to her organs, mainly. Monthly transfusions have kept flare-ups at bay for quite awhile now, though. Yay!
Bailey, I love you - we are humans doing human things. Keep going, you're a sweetheart 😘
What about the children?
A revolver is a firearm that has a rotating cylinder which hold 6 shots and can also be known as pistol, handgun as well a six shooter. The Peacemaker which is a Colt Single Action Army Revolver and was designed by Samuel Colt for the U.S. government in 1872, put to use in 1873-1895(ish) . This means the shooter would not have had to reload until all 6 were used.  There were other revolvers out during that time period too.
I'm not sure why you stopped  your dark history. It was a lot of insensitive dark tears.. like this series!  Let us all gather and get to the gore.
Thank you 🙏
The McStay Family 💔💔
Hey.. I graduated from Angelo State University lol
YEAH!!  Bailey is back on Mondays!! Love you, girl!!
"Eye fricken rooooolll" 😂😂
Wow.. I knew this chick personally.  She was OUT THERE... love the show!!
Nail polish color?
Did you say Colorado Springs cause that’s where all the army bases are hunting the Navy maybe you did I’m sorry
I think they call it a "peacemaker", bc you have time to make peace with your maker. I think, don't hold me to that lol 😆
Wow they where let out?  it's because the where white
Last video of the theme song ☹️😭
18:55 BAYB... BAEB... I WANNA GUNN
I watched this on the ID channel, about 4years ago the show was about a cop who lived in Colorado Springs and he worked this case.  His name was Joe Kenda, I've always thought that the husband had so much more to do with it too.💖
Missed ya Bailey!
Audrey 2
your hair looks amazing here tho, bailey.
It always makes me laugh when that you can walk in the supermarket and pick up yourself a gun along with your food shopping Walmart has a supermarket chain here in Uk 🇬🇧 called Asda and I can’t imagine there being a gun counter 🤡🤪
I also raptor screech when I'm excited about my hair working out, for a change.
"She must have been in pain" Well um yea I think she must have been she was shot through the shoulder......Anyway love the video as always
How did I miss this.  Hope your doing well and taking care of yourself.
I want nay-nay merch
I definitely think he deserves the same punishment because of what she said is true (which wouldn’t shock me), that constitutes spiritual abuse. There’s a deep history of people doing crazy and harmful things to themselves and others as a result of spiritual abuse and manipulation.
Colorado is garbage.
We will always support you and love you. We got you girlfriend.
Colorado springs. Not small lol sure maybe in comparison to LA but not small. I grew up out there for over 16 years and I know exactly where this took place.
Bailey!!!! I missed you!
Love your make-up.
🤗🤗🥳😺😸❤💋💋
Hey, not sure if I’m just missing it but is the Best Fiends link missing?
Was LT Joe Kenda on this case? This sounds familiar.
Missed you here happy you're back.
Love you and im so glad you are okay I was afraid you were becoming burnt out. I'm so happy your still doing mondays
LOVE YOU! LOVE YOU! LOVE YOU!
“Hey Bri” 😂
Actually there is a drill, there's a reminder.
Is MMM coming back? I miss you on mondays! I always looked forward to it, I hope you are doing better though!
My husband has lupus. It's not fun. In a lot of pain a lot of the time.
You should make a video about the Brandon Teena story
Is this the last mm&mm? I really miss them.
Bailey I’m so sorry that you’re dealing with a lot right now. We miss you and are here waiting when you’re ready to come back. Take care of you ❤️
COME BACK!! Missing my dose of Bailey on Monday's.
Baileyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy lol we miss youuuuuuu💕 happyhealing❤️‍🩹
Just a suggestion for a future video; I don't think you've done a video on Amber Pasztor? I'd love to hear your take and opinion on her story with her kids, parents, neighbour and boyfriend/friend. You also look stunning, thank you for taking the time to make these videos for us!
I'm rewatching MMM videos, why have I already seen them all? 😭 Hope you're doing ok Bailey, sending love from Ireland 💚
I think it’s funny her: “your not just going to go up to some random guys house and find this revolver.” me: “unless you go to the house of a gun collector and find one.” 🤣
I laughed way too hard at “slappin meats”
Did you stop these?! I haven't seen any new ones in months, you just came back....
Please cover the Kendrick Johnson and Tamla Horsford cases.
Is has been 2 months, Is all well?
Me: Bailey's hair is SOOOO cute in this video!  Two seconds later... Bailey: Isn't my hair cute today? Me: Yes, Bailey 💜 Yes it is 🥰🥰🥰
If you can try to focus on MMM because I really like it! Lol I don’t like dark history I guess it’s not for me.
PLEASE DO A VIDEO ON HARVEY MARCELIN FROM CYPRESS HILLS NY
22:18 sir,that is clearly a sin...sir
When are we getting a new mmm Monday ? 😫😫😫
Why can't I find any new Monday uploads? This is the newest one I have
Bailey Mondays aren't the same without you 🥺🥺 I hope your ok🙏❤️ sending positive vibes to you 🙌✨
when you are ready to post more videos you should do the maddie clifton case!!
I’m trying to write a research paper… but here we are watching Bailey… I have priorities 😂
Need mmm back 😭 understand your situation tho sending love
Oh you should do one on Marcus Wesson, it's one of the saddest and scariest cases I've ever seen
I have a wild and sad one for you. Look up Helen Betty Osbourn and the conspiracy of Silence.
That mother-in-law SAW AN OPPORTUNITY to tell Jennifer how she really felt about her 😅
They weren’t going to get rid of Ben… he was the scape goat
Do the Rachel and Diane Stuadte case!
I miss mm&m so much. Please come back!! I love your videos so much
she said IM BACK & then left us for 2 months now 💀
BAILEYYY COME BACK IM DYING WITHOUT YOU
Did she just copy the sanasa song from Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie ?
Three more days until you're back with a new episode of mm&mm and I can not wait! I miss you Bailey!
does anyone know why she hasn't posted another one of these for so long????
Can you do a video on  Fred and Rose West? I just found out about them 😱
Super Cute hair!
Hi Bailey! I was thinking if you could do the case of Junko Furuta. Love your videos!
I love you and I hope you are doing okay!❤️
You should tell the story of the girls who killed their mother. The movie ‘Perfect Sisters’ is based on that story.
Hey there.  I'm new to your show, and I absolutely love it. LOVE TRUE  CRIME STORIES🖤❤🖤❤🖤 I have a request if you see this post.... check out The Betty Broderick story.  Looking forward to seeing more of your stories.  Thank you 😊
Please do more muder mystery and makeup! Dark history just isn't the same and it's making my heart big sad 🥺
Does anyone know where her MMM videos are? I don't watch her Dark History nor do I have a lot of social media's. Is she okay? Is she just taking a break? I just wanna make sure she is okay along with curious where her MMM are. She hasn't posted a new one since this one...which was 2 months ago.
What brushes do you use? I did not see those listed. Thanks Biiiyeeee
Please take the time to check out Melissa Platts case they need help the police and district attorney is ignoring so much evidence. I think you would definitely be interested in this case and it will make such a difference. I'm sorry I didn't know where else to send a link. I love your channel and never miss and episode you are amazing and I truly feel your followers would get invested in this case also. Just reaching out to the family would mean so much. I adore you and am a huge fan. I watch all your videos and I believe you could make a huge difference this woman was literally beat to death the hospital documented prolonged severe abuse that cause so much damage including a head injury that cause a brain bleed her jaw broken in two places. Yet the police just took the man who did this explanation of a fall in the bathroom.  I won't go into more detail because I haven't fully researched this. Please look into the case I know your extremely busy but I know the family would be so grateful if you used you platform to help bring awareness and get justice. I admire everything you do. ❤️
Please talk about Nicole Addimando next!!!! 🙏

Or the girl in a the box from Redbluff California!
You should do Wayne Adam ford, from humboldt county California. He was so interesting.
You should look into Georgia Tann
You should do a story on Dorothea Puente.

My mondays aren't the same anymore. 😭😭😭
So the GUN was actually the SMOKING GUN!  Hmmm
can you do a video on andrea yates??
I know there are so many deaths talked about on this channel, and all are horrible in their own way. But the way Diane died is so sad to me. It was so quick and she even almost got away and people couldn’t do anything about without risking their own lives. It was truly tragic for everyone there and I don’t know. I know for a lot of those people it really felt like it could happen to anyone. And yes I’d say that was an execution. So sad 😞
I hope you are well x Please come back we all miss you
Hope your doing ok gf ☺️ don't let your crown fall xo ❤️👑
"What a f**king winner..." My favourite line from this episode lol
Watching this in March and "lets hope that 2022 treats us right" ALREADY didnt age well.
"Are We In Clue???!!!!" 🤣💀💀💀💀💀
If its not the spouse, check the spouse's mistress/bf.
Bailey can you please do one on the Dyatlov Pass Hikers Please
You should cover the Amber Dubois story from Escondido CA . I went to high school with her and it was a very tragic story so many twisted details
Do a story on Madeleine Mccann
Miss you Bailey 😭😭
You are an amazing woman Ms Bailey  Sarian. I've falling asleep to you and mrballens voice. It'd be awesome if you and him worked together ❤  Keep being you girl xo 😘
Are you EVER going to do another Monday Makeup video???? Dark history is OK. But dont lose the original audience who got you here wants to see please!!!!!
The case of “TAYLOR SHABUISNES “
I wish we could still watch you every Monday!
Are there going to be anymore MMM videos?
Where are you??? I understand you needing some time but uploading other videos and not letting us know is just not ok! Very disappointed in that
Are we ever getting another mmm??????
I miss your MM&MM, Bailey. 😔
Can you please check this one out Who is Corinna Smith? Wife kills man with boiling sugar mix for allegedly molesting their kids  The mother-of-two committed this violent act after her daughter claimed that the father had sexually assaulted her and her brother when they were children
I need more Monday episodes
Can you do one on Elisabeth fritzl please 🥺
Are you not doing MMMM anymore?
Are you on a looonnnggg break from mmm?  Because it’s been a month or longer.  I’m more interested in the mmm than dark history.  But you seem to just be focusing on that.   Hope you’ll do more mmm soon!!!
Bailey, am missing you doing these videos
We miss you
Bailey where are you?  We miss you and MMM.
When are you coming back
You should  look into Jack Wayne Reeves  He is so suspish  He’s had four wives and he probably killed 2 of them  His first wife was only 15 when they got married  and then they divorced  Wife number 2 “shot herself”  His third wife, Myong Reeves, a mail-order bride, had drowned in Lake Whitney in 1984. Myong’s sister had been suspicious of him, claiming Reeves beat her sister and that Myong, who couldn't swim, never would have gone in a lake Wife number 4 was another mail order bride from the Philippines  They never found wife number 4   Definitely worth checking out!!
You should do a MMM on Adolf Coors! It is an interesting story! Also missed MMM sooo much I watch old episodes, well listen and occasionally peek at your gorgeous work while I am working!
Did she announce when she is doing these again? I know she is taking a personal break, which I 100000% support, im just curious because I miss these 😢
You should do Dole Chadee from Trinidad and Tobago, the infamous gang leader
Can you talk about Chris Dawson?
When is MMM GOING TO BE BACK.  I MISS YOU.
She should do one on Israel Keyes
Love you Bailey. Missing you and MMM.
so technically it was the husband so it's always the husband
We love you and your show.  Be back soon
Do the story of: don’t drink the look aid..
I laughed so hard at the prison break part
Do a video on Brendon Teena plzzzzz
Bailey could you do one on Pam Hubb? I would love to see a video done by you about her crime. ❤️
Can you do the story of Maddie Clifton?
Anatoly moskvin
Can you do Albert fish??? He’s known as the real Hannibal lecture and the boogie man
Melanie Mcguire story please 🥺

I'm not sure if you've already done this one but dorthea puente is an awful but interesting case
Would love to see you do a story on Josef Fritzl
Please look into The Ant Hill Kids cult.
Have you done Melanie McGuire yet?
I’d love if you could do a video on the Mendez brothers! I don’t know much about the case but from what I do know it seems very sad
I know it's probably not well known but if you could do the Cleveland kidnappings of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, and Michelle Knight. It was a big deal in the Cleveland area and was such a huge mystery for 10 years.
ma’am i will give you my left lung if you do the Alice Gross case when you come back
Girl... We miss you and your MMM episodes! Besos and hugs 😘😘😘
I just watched wynonna Earp and I thought it was weird the gun was called peace maker but it’s the same one! You should do an episode on Wyatt Earp
bro my birthday is sep 29 😭😱
I miss this show!!!
Hi Bailey. Could you do the Dorothea Puente story.  ♡love your channel♡
You need to do Dorothea Puente!! ❤️
You should do a video on Joshua Maddox. Definitely weird. It’s also unsolved.
Where did you get those hair clips
Bailey, you should cover the case of Nohema Graber next. She was a high school Spanish teacher from Iowa killed by two of her students
Can you do a Video on Judith Barsi? She is the voice behind Ducky from the Land Before Time. She was shot by her father. That's all I know. 🙏🙏🙏
please do the joshua maddox case !!
Bailey can you pleeeeease do a video on Taylor Schabusiness and the dismemberment of her boyfriend? It just happened in Wisconsin. They're saying she idolized Jeffrey Dahmer
Can you do the case of josh Maddox? It’s apparently a cold case and it’s really really weird. I though you and others may enjoy it
Who else NEEDS Bailey's version to the O.J. Simpson case? 🙏
Come back Bailey, we miss MMMM 😢
It’s called the peace maker cause it kills your enemies leaving you in peace lol
Apparently she posted on Twitter that she's taking a break from MMM.. guess her and the fiance split.. she's still doing Dark History because it was a contract..
Can you do a story on Van Taylor and Edward Deli?  Please and Thank you!! Love your show!
I'm back caussssse... I miss MMM 😪.
Where are mondays??? It has been over a month since you did one! We will all of course understand taking self time but you said you were back and haven’t been. Loving dark history which has been on point with what you say but mm&mm is a whole different vibe and where is it?!? If you need to take a break I get it but I haven’t seen an announcement? (Did I miss something) you keep saying that it comes on Monday’s but you took like the whole of winter break off and then did one and you haven’t done anything with it since then! Again if you say I am taking a break I completely get it. It just is that you haven’t said that and keep saying on dark history that mondays are for mm&mm! But they aren’t anymore! Please let us in on when or if to expect more. You do you but don’t tell us one thing and do another!
Bailey! Where did MM&MMs??? I miss you! I'm glad you're having fun doing HH, but it's not my jam. Come back to us on Mondays! Hearts.
Is this the last episode she has made? Wondering if there are no newer ones. This is the last one I can see 😫
When are my mondays I so look for these so so much
Please do The disappearance of David Glenn lewis
Omgd I remember this was an episode on Homicide Hunter!!!!!
Dorothea Puente
Dorothea Puente
where are you? i miss you and hope you're okay
Where'd you go Bailey? Ok...your new channel is ok...but...Not this. 😞
I'm really missing MM&M, Dark History just isn't the same
I am so happy to see your face again 💗
Slapping meats 🤣🤣🤣
Bailey I'm not trying to be rude but where are you girl
You should do one on Wayne Adam Ford also really missing MMM 😭
How do you do the click noise with your mouth before you say noggin?
So I just found out about the mysterious case of "Josh Maddux, the Boy in the Chimney" and thought of you. The article I read had a lot of unanswered questions and I think it's super interesting
Ok, Bailey... WE MISS YOU TERRIBLY! Please come BACK!
I'm a huge fan Bailey!! Your so beautiful and I love how you get into all of these stories! Do you think you could do Dorathy Puente???
Bailey! HIII
can you do the Mendez Brothers?
You should look at the Richard Oland story - unsolved mystery! In Canada as well!
I'm not sure if you did the story of Diana Lovejoy. I would love to hear you do it
COME BACK!!!!!!
The name comes from the fact the weapon could fire multiple times and anyone of any size could wield the weapon. At this point smaller men and women could defend themselves from large strong aggresive attacks. Thus the firearm ensured a peaceful society
So police are like "yay" 🤣🤣🤣 she's so cool.
Bailey I hope you can do audio books.  Jennifer looks like she's enjoying herself on that first mugshot. Brian is a totally incompetent as a man.
I am new to the channel and I am LOVING it I listen to your videos while I get ready and on my drive to work. Could you do a video on Ryan Alexander Jenkins??
do a video on katherine knight!
I wonder if you have ever done a segment about Lawrence Singleton and his amazing survivor victim - She walked 3 miles out of a canyon after he cut off both arms!  She then went on to testify against him not once, but twice!
I always hear youtubers say “this case has been talked about so much, there’s just nothing I can add to it, so that’s why I’ve been putting it off.”  Respectfully, we don’t care how many times someone has made a video about xyz… we want to hear YOU tell the story. we like the way YOU tell stories, and want to hear you talk about it  :) ❤️
So are you going to come back Mondays or should we stop looking for you?
"What in the time travel is going on right now?" 🤣
“Go into a Walmart and pick it up” … ya’ll sell guns in Walmart ?!? Hahahah America is wild
You should do the Shawn Grate case out of Ohio that spanned 2006-2016
MMM is my favorite thing you do. I think it is because it is just you and not overly produced. I realize your gaining traction and making those amazing deals with Netflix and other companies...I just hope you start doing these again.  Congratulations on everything coming your way!  We miss you out chea...
Does anyone know if there will be anymore new episodes on YouTube ?
Has stopped makeup mysteries mondays???
I love dark history but I miss getting ready together 😭😭 hope you're doing well!
You should do Samuel Little’s case !!
We miss you and MMM Bailey!!! It's like a piece of my life is missing! But I'm sure I speak for several when I say we Love you! 💕 Take all the time you need, we aren't going anywhere. ❤️
I miss MMM’s, but I’m sure once it’s back it’ll be just right.
Hey, bailey! You should do a video on Andrew and Zachary bagby. There's a documentary called 'Dear Zachary' that is based on their story and it's super sad.
Do Oscar Pistorius please it’s so sad to see how he got such a little sentence for the crime he committed.
Please come back soon. We miss you and love you!
I hope your ok Bailey we miss you💕💕
They both deserved life in prison without parole. Yes, Ben was probably next.
Okay am I the only one who hears “son of Sam, son of Sam” during the theme song 😂😂😂
MISSING MMM-New stories! When are you posting new videos? We love you!🙂
"So Dianne runs and they ca"...... insert Ad, so at iHerb.....NOOOOOOOO, why does an ad have to do that now
Where you at bailey? I need my dose of MMM 😫
When is MMM coming back?
When are you coming back on Mondays 😭😭
Are you okay? I miss you on mondays 🥺❤️
2022 does not treat us right lol
“We in clue” 😂🤣
Are you only doing Dark History now? Cause I really miss your MMM Mondays!😥 It must be hard doing both. Oh!!! I just read in the comments that you're having a hard time these days. We fans enjoy watching you Bailey. But rest assured. We can wait till you get your energies back. Hang in there! 🧡💛💚💙
Bailey!! We need more MMM!! <3 We miss you!
DOROTHEA PUENTE ‼️
Did she quit this?
Bailey is on a personal break and going through things. Some of these comments do not pass the vibe check. Some of you have very little respect that she is a human just like us and goes through things just like us.
When are you coming back?
Ok but like I love the hair clips you use all the time and I need to know where you buy them please and thank you! <3
Should do one on Katherine knight
Came back to realize it’s only been a month without MMM and honestly, it feels like it’s been YEARS.
I'm confused have you stopped the video version of this?! I'm seeing a bunch of episodes on Spotify
Elan....sorry
Could you do a story on the elon Private school documentaries from the 70s clear up to 2011. What horrible ways these kids were treated.
tHEME sONG!!!!!
Is this the last MMM? Where have you been?
im not sure if youve ever done this case but you should totally do OJ Simpson :O!! love your content <3
So disappointed ☹️ are you doing mmm anymore???? I watch Dark History but it's not the same. 😭😭😭
You should totally do madame delphine lalaurie!!😍 i love all your videos bailey:0 (and if you dont know how to pronounce it, the way they do in american horror story is amazing) 😅
Direct amazing quote " lemme think hmmmm noooower"
I come on every Monday and I never see any new videos 😭 is this series over ?
After research (i don’t have twitter or instagram or believe media) but it seems Bailey may be experiencing very upsetting personal problems. I hope shes healing however way she needs too. I hope she knows her fans will wait for her for as long as it takes for her heart and soul to heal and for her to keep her private life as private and to deal with her pain with her loved ones and close friends. It’s none of our business even if she feels like a bff in a house when we watch her. This is a time to heal and we give her our virtual support and comfort and respect her privacy. Thoughts are with you and we care about you. Love you Bailey i hope you are being looked after and know that you are very special.
I'm loving your hair!!
So is this the last episode we’re gonna get.?? Cuz I’m sad…
Dark History is still going, while MMMM stopped? I'm confused.
Miss you so much Bailey! Monday's are not the same without you. I hope you can come back soon. MMM make my week just better.
Can you do a story on Diana Lovejoy?
could you cover the oscar pistorious case? it’s all over my tiktok fyp and would love to hear what you have to add !!!🤎🤎
Bailey!!! *hugs* hate that you are having a rough time but I just wanted you to know that very recently I was going through a tough time and binging your MMM helped me get thru for real. Heart ❤️ you.
Hope you come back on Monday!!! I like watching the make up!!!
COME BACK TO US, BAILEY! WE MISS YOU! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Love and light from Denmark, Scandinavia ❤️
Hope you are well, hope to see you on mondays again soon🤩🥰
Anyone know if Bailey is coming back to MMM?
Bailey you should have a look at Tbe Gainesville Ripper
When will this series be back Queen?! No rush! Just totally curious ♥️
My husband has a crazy ex girlfriend named Jennifer and she gave us some trouble for a couple years and this video reinforced my hatred for the name 😅
The whole time Bailey was saying Jennifer i was dying! In my mind I’m like “What BAILEY?!” 😂😂😂
You said you were back..... it basically march.  No hate, just curious  where  the M.m..m.!! Sudasssaaaa
Please make a video on the real stories of texas chainsaw massacre
You should do a video on the mass shooter from Nova Scotia April 2020! Gabriel Wortman
It's peace, love and chicken grease!
Where are you??  Miss you Bailey!!
please dont everrrr get rid of this theme song 😆🙌🏻its my favorite part of every video !!!! Lol
Miss MMM soooooooooooooo much 💔❣️💔❣️💔❣️
Update: 2022 isn’t treating us right🥴
Are you doing okay Bailey? I’m waiting for your next videos… how’re you doing?
So wait... are there no more MMM???
You haven't posted in while I miss muder mistery Mondays videos
"..... slopping meats together ....." 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Could you do one on Jason Eric Massey
i was wondering if you could do the leo frank case? :)
It should’ve been equal or he should got more sentences then her for convening her to do such a harmful crime
come backkk 😩😩😩😩 i miss mm+m sm
hello bailey i was just wondering if you could do something about Summer Wells
Can you even imagine being this innocent, flower shop owner just living your life, then all of a sudden the church leader's having an affair in your shop. Like wft, what do you even do? Poor guy.
Bailey are you coming back to MMMM? We miss you so much.
“Let’s hope 2022 treats us right”  *Ww3 begins two months later*
Happy new year 2022
I HOPE she wasn't 28 in the first picture.... otherwise Brian had traded fillet mignon for fish fingers 👏👏
I'd like to see you do a video on something like dyatlov pass! It's a really interesting story if you haven't heard about it before it's at least worth checking out!
Your hair looks so cute I love it 😍
Hi Bailey, I'm a silent listener since forever, but I finally decided to put in my suggestion because literally NO ONE has covered it ever. And who better than you? It's the Xbox Massacre in Deltona, FL and it really shook me when it happened. Plz consider!
I'd love for you to do a story on Gabrielle Fernández
Honestly I think she was manipulated. The husband was a man in power, and has a high standing in a church that that woman believed in. Sometimes we don't really notice it but church leaders or anyone in general who we believe in can easily manipulate us without us even noticing it.
Sounds like Brian and Jennifer were trying to have Dianne killed by a "unknown" person, and they were trying to frame Ben as that "unknown person. Why else would Jennifer use Ben's gun and dump HIS clothing? they both wanted to get rid of their spouses, but Brian seemingly wanted it more since he took out an insurance policy thing. With that, I can sort of see Brian manipulating Jennifer to do this with the whole holy talk BS, but she still did the crime AND try to pin it on someone else. They should've served equal sentences IMO.
Have you done one on the cult ant hill kids from the 70s? It’s bananas
Can you do a video about Debora Green?
Thank you, Bailey. I love your videos. Could you tell us about the case of Mary Elizabeth Wilson and /or the Charles Stuart (Boston) case? Also have you tried any face painting type of make up? Like Avant-garde? Maybe a cherry blossom design would look cool with your hair? Thx for your time and hours of entertainment during the pandemic.
No more true crime...? As far as I know, this is the only video from this year(I know about Dark History). Does anyone know what is going on?
The real mystery is what happened to MMMM?  BAILEY, I Hope everything is okay, just one step at a time.
Have you heard about the Sun Gym Gang? My husband and I were watching Pain & Gain and I got curious and looked it up, it looks pretty fascinating and obviously the real life story is more interesting than the movie. Told him I'd love to get your run down on it
Can you do the Kendrick Johnson case!!!??
I want to see you do a story on Genie Wiley
I love it!!! A MMM!!!
Bailey:  Hello guys I’m lying to you Me: lie to me Bailey
You should check into the story of the Carr brothers from Wichita,KS. Miss you and MMM!! Hope you’re doin ok!
PLEASE LOOK UP DEVERNON LEGRAND “THE REVEREND” - yikes!
Honestly , I need more mmm !! Dark history ain’t doing it for me . Where you at bey?
Yes Colorado springs is awesome 😎😎
I love your MMM videos. Keep them coming, not sure if you've done a video on them before but the Ken and Barbie killers are interesting
I love the theme song 🎵 I sing “sana sa sana saaaa” all the time now
didnt she try and pin it on husband since she wanted him to take the gun back
“I’ll see you guys next week!” … one month later and still no MMM, you okay sis?
I used to click every Monday.... I've basically given up. What happened?
Miss these I hope there back soon!   If running out of ideas maybe death of Elisa Lam ❤️
“We got a streaker” 🤣🤣🤣
Please do Israel Keyes !
I HAVE A STORY FOR YOU, LOOK UP SHOOTING IN CORSICANA, TX 2022

WE MISS YOU BAILEY 💕💕
Me: "it's the husband" Bailey: "now I know you all at home are thinking it's the husband." Me: 👀
I MISS THE CRIME CASE'S
Wow I missed your true crime stories! I like the history stories but not as much as these!  Take breaks from them instead of these🤣 please????
It has been a month and I miss my MMM. Please be safe, take care of you!  Times are tuff and you are strong!  Love, hugs and healing energy to you.
it was Jennifer
I agree Amanda
my mums friend had lupus
I literally check everyday to see if you posted a MMM video😭
Why am I not getting notice of make-up videos anymore?
I wish you would do a tutorial on how you do your makeup.
Is MMMM still on or just dark history? I miss my Mondays with Bailey!
I love this! And your makeup is just Gorge...
I knew this story sounded familar - it's because it is also on Homocide Hunter! If anyone is curious to see the original detectives response to the crime, check it out.
I just watched the Tulsa Race Massacre. Did you know Osage County (of which Tulsa is a part) also saw a string of around 60 mysterious deaths and disappearances of Osage  Native Americans at about the same timeframe? I would love to hear more about this fascinating and tragic story. At that time, the Osage were among the most wealthy people in the country but were not allowed to manage their money and their children were required to go to residential schools. Bailey!!! You need to at least check this out 🙏🏻
I wish you did more mmm. Dark history is ok but mmm is way better. Love you Bailey
Did I miss something here.....Did she stop doing MMM videos?. Monday's aren't the same without them :(
If they had kids, the peacemaker would be the least likely for a child to be able to use. Maybe he knew she wouldn't really need to use it, so he chose for the kids' safety.
How to reach to her for a request on a new story
Are you done with MM&M?
I haven't watched your last five videos, I feel like your letting your channel go, which makes me sad. You were my favorite You tuber. I am glad your following your dreams although.
My hubby graduated from the Air Force Academy.
I loveeee her❤️❤️
🥰 love your MMM!!   How about chester weger!?
Peace maker was Wyatt Earp's weapon
🖤🖤I MISS YOUR SIT AND CHAT VIDEOS🖤🖤 hope you’re doing well xoxo
I looked him up. He died the beginning of this year.
Can someone please tell me where the theme song came from haha
When you said “Are we in clue?” It pops up as Klu. I almost choked on my chicken tenders 😭
For anyone reading this please inform me if she has done the dark real story about Alice the real Alice connected to Alice in wonderland
I swear, i wish things were how they were when you could send fan mail, i need autographed bailey poster/pic
Bailey!! Can you please do Carl Panzram??
“JenBen”, but you missed the opportunity to say “Briane” (Brian + Diane). ☺️ Love your content!
Both life. They took her from her children!
That foundation is the perfect shade!
Just love you 💜 keep doing you!
i hope you also tell the story and provide your reaction as well for the brandon teena story♥️
Love these!! Have you ever heard of Tim Bosma? Look him up, it's sad.
❤❤❤
Here is one Geology with a gruesome tale in NW Iowa Gitchie Manitou
Please cover Gary Gilmore!!!
Yo I just saw you in a Netflix ad, Congrats!!!! well deserved!!!!
I miss you Bailey,please post soon ,love you
This was amazing! If you haven't heard of the small town case in Dothan, AL of the JB Beasley and Tracy Hawlett you should check it out. There's a fall guy and possible police cover up
Hey!! Love your videos. Could you do one on Robert Hansen?
I have a story for you.  I know its not national story (that I know of)but it shook us in 2017.  In Topeka, KS in March 2017 there was a triple homicide.
Dear Bailey, Do you use a template to colour your eyebrows? If so, please show us how to use it - I don't seem to have enough hands to hold the template, keep it flat against my skin, and also apply colour to the brush and then colouring in my eyebrows. Somehow the template lifts and I end up with this massive eyebrow because the template slipped. Help this old lady please.
Gabbie Pettino case
As someone who suffers from lupus you did a wonderful job explaining it so the general public will understand.  There is no cure for lupus and there are different kinds.
Bailey, we're looking forward to some new MMM videos! We miss you, c'mon
When is MMM coming back I like dark history but I love MMM I’ve been watchin em for years please bring ‘em back

Hello Bailey. When will you be back?
You said place full of army people. Like who go church and work at local floral shops….. I laughed so hard. I think more then likely, it’s full of single soldiers who drink everyday and do drink PT in the morning 😂
Uhmmmm are we still doing this show orrrrrr.......?
Miss you!! Where you been? Patiently waiting for next MMM video 😊
When is your next video coming out? It's been a few weeks and my husband and I are starting to miss you.
Anyone else love the homicide hunter episode about this?
excuse this ign'ant make, but what are you doing to your eyebrows at the beginning of the vid?
Haha!  It's a peacemaker because it permanently shuts someone up :/
U
We miss you girly and we miss MMM! Hope you’re doing well and take as much time as you need! We love you Bailey.

That eyeliner is amazing! I love your stories
Is MMM dead?
Do Marybeth Tinning, Stacey Kastor
Sweet Bailey! People are commenting that you areńt doing too well, and I don’t know too much about it but I just want to say that I hope you know we don’t mind waiting for you. You are highly appreciated by so many of us, but i think we all hope you feel free to take all the time you need for yourself. <3 YOU, your well-being, is a lot more important than feeding and entertaining us with your charisma and wit. Sending you warm thoughts from Oslo, Norway, and wishing that life will be kind to you! <3
It’s always the Brians
Idk if you already did this but I would love to see an episode on Alaska’s butcher baker

Hey Bailey can you please cover the Adrianna Hutto case I resent Lu learned about it and it is such a sad and heavy story and I rlly want you to cover it please and thank you<3
Equal blame! They had a plan.
I don't know if you know about the South African cult where their king pin basically Manson'd a bunch of people and she was so close to getting away with it as well, there's a documentary about it called Devilsdorp
Charles sexton! Freaking crazyyy check it out there’s so much to that case

Hello I'm new and I LOVE your videos! I feel like this crossover of makeup and true crime is perfectly tailored for me 😆 thank you for providing such great content. And I just have to say that I got my boyfriend (who didn't want anything to do w my true crime podcasts) hooked on your videos! We both love the way you tell the stories and your personality! 💙

I just finished army basic training and your videos at my AIT are bringing me back to life thank you for continuing what you do 😭❤️
Brian (at least in that photo of him) looks like David Boreanaz (the guy who played Angel in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Agent Booth on Bones), and now I want them to make a movie about this just so he can play the husband.
Just noticed the t-shirt you're wearing:  SUSPISH.  (I'd buy one, if you are offering it to the public!).  I love it.  You are such a great story teller, and you have a wonderful, unique sense of humor.
I’m so sorry! I did NOT mean to hit the dislike button! I am half asleep 🤣🤣🤣 love you girllllll
Hi Bailey!!! I’ve been checking to see if any new episodes of MMM have been posted, and I’m so sad that there aren’t any 🥺🥺 I check every Monday since this episode was posted and I don’t see new ones I do watch all your NEW DH episodes. So my question is… do you have a separate YouTube channel dedicated to MMM?
"Bengbeng gimme yer bag"😂😂
Can you do a video on the kidnapping of Patty Hearst and the Stockholm syndrome?
Bailey, I LOVE Dark History. Missing me some MM&M as well! 💖💖💖💖
Scott Spurlock
Are you planning on doing anymore of these or just the history ones 🤔
Bailey please do a true crime video on Joshua Stimpson
I'm so sorry that your going through a hard time. Wish you the best
Please do a video on Cherish Perrywinkle
Can you do one on Mary Bell and find out what happened to her
Just researched someone I would like you to tell the world about because she hasn't gotten what she deserves. In fact, she gets out this year and it scares me. Would you do an episode on Shelly knotek?
CAN YOU PLEASE DO THE MENÉNDEZ BROTHERS CASE PLEASEEEE I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT BY ANYONE ELSE BUT YOU

I don’t know if you have, but you should cover the story of Celeste Beard!! 🙂
Did Bailey stop doing MMM’s? Maybe I missed something. I miss them. Or is she doing them once a month? Hope everything is ok. Just curious if I missed something.
Bailey, we miss your MMM!! Dark history is ok but mondays just aren't the same !! Need some of that OG content with a Joan Crowford collab!

Brian should have received the death penalty, in my opinion.
You should do a story on Robert Pickton . Based in canada
Slapping meats together. 🙄🤣🤣🤣
I would so love a video about Dorothea Puete!
Where is Bailey?? I haven't seen her do this show in a while but she's continuing with Dark History!
Hey something  about Jennifer that sound sooo cray cray hahaha I love you Bailey

You should do a story on Stephen avery
I love those clips!!!
"Slapping meats together" Nice Bailey 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's my take "Peace maker" any gun used to save others and Make Peace Yes......
Ur soooo right about we gotta stop giving opinions on people especially these days! The more messed up people are they show a fake happiness "perfection" couple type ish
Is this series over? Jw cause I see regular Dark History series uploads..
I wish my ole man would hang out with his friend girl in the gym jacuzzi!! 🤣 tuuuhhh!!
I know it's a fairly popular case but it would be so cool if you covered Fox Hollow Farm. :) get better though!
Can you do Spain's most shocking and famous case? There's even a netflix documentary on it. It's called 'El caso Alcasser'. Look into it please, it would mean a lot if you made a video on it :)
Pls come back soon!!! I’m so sad without you!❤️🙏🏻💔💔💔💔💔
Hi! Love your channel! Can you do an MMM for Jodi Huisentruit ?

I absolutely love watching your videos, as does my 8mo old son..  he just loves your voice.  I have always wanted to get into makeup but here's my dilemma.. I have Graves disease,  which causes my eyes to bulge..  any recommendations on how to pull off ANY kind of makeup w this mess I've got.?
In honor of black history month can you cover the story of Emmett Till ? Please & thank you, I just feel everyone should know about him & the movement that was created due to his death.💙
I love your hair!!
Have you done anything on Nathaniel White? His home in Goshen NY was actually just bulldozed in last couple of years and a Lego land was built there. 😬 creepy
We NEED merch with “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t knooow” 👀
Long time listener (though not the longest time subscriber, shamefully), first time *commenter* : just wanted to say I absolutely fckin love you (I’m convinced we would be great friends irl - I flatter myself), hope you’re doin okie, and miss you deeearly (you aaaand your MMMMs).

There’s this older man in a motorcycle club I was in, his name is peacekeeper, but I would call him peacemaker 😂😂
bailey where was all the MMM videos
Would you do a video on the Candy Man Dean Carl?
I check for MMM monday every single Monday. Sorry you’re going through a tough time. We all go through tough times and i just want to let you know your videos bring me so much joy. Whenever I’m feeling down, my fiancé knows the drill and is like ok let me get you blankets and put on Bailey. ❤️ thank you for always being here for us and i hope you’re finding your own Bailey during this time. Love ya girl. Hope to see you whenever you’re ready ❤️❤️
Are we gonna have any more MM&M Monday’s? 🥺
hey bailey, can we get a Bianca Devins video ?
I could really cry I’m having withdrawals, if she did recently break up…. We love you girl and are here for you ❤️ hope you get well ❤️‍🩹 and not soon TAKE YOUR TIME 🥺
You should cover the case of the 10 year old girl in Wisconsin who stomped on a baby, I can’t remember her name, but it’d be a very interesting case??
Missing your videos!!!
Wondered where you’ve been. Hope you’re ok.
Where did you get your hair clips? 😩 I LOVE them.
Please consider the story of Diane Downz
You should do a video on Bruce MCarthur (Ontario, Canada)  And If you do; Madoc is pronounced like MAY- DOCK And Peterborough is pronounced like PETER- BURROW 🤣
Miss these!
I wish you’d go back to doing more of this show and less of Dark History. I miss MMMM so much , and it’s so much better than DH .
Where are you?
“They was spending time in the jacuzzi for weeks”.  That’s a long time in a jacuzzi.   Lol.
Is MM&M over? 😢
How do I find out what make-up she is using … would somebody please tell me? Thank you
excuse me when are you releasing another one of these ???
I LOVE this look on her! Just phenomenal! Also, Brian's jail pics are unnerving to me for some reason. Like he was enjoying notoriety or something. Also- WE <3 YOU BAILEY!!! EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY!!! Maybe not right at this moment, but it will be. The storm will end and a rainbow will light up your skies soon dear girl!!
Can you please do a video on the Livye Lewis case
talk about the bosnian genocide while doing makeup girl that would be so funny
✨science✨ I freaking love you 😂😂
Where have you been, Bailey?
Literally described lupus perfectly haha As someone who was diagnosed with it, that's how I explain it to people. :P  I'm also shocked there support groups for it 😲
I don’t understand how the brother would stand up for Brian who cheated on his sick sister and was having an affair… like huh
I'm telling you, never trust Brian's with an I, there always shady.
💀bet he feels bad for cheating now that she’s dead, cheaters really don’t care about any bodies emotions but themselves 💀
BAILY can you pleeeeeease do Bruce McArthur?
Bailey come backkkk. We miss you ❤️
Thats
I had a stranger tell me that my makeup reminds them of Baileys makeup and it was the best compliment I've ever received
We, the fans of Bailey need a tattoo tour!!! 🙌🏼
Is she done with MM&M?
You should definitely do the Kansas City strangler….detailed but crazy!
The Forgotten Series
Feel like B watched too many Deadly Women episodes
Your in my thoughts B, I hope you heal in the best way possible. Your GF from afar! RC.
did anyone else just fin this girl and now cant stop binging
Bailey ????!!???!!! Where are yoooouuuu ???!!!
Yes, please!  Come to Colorado Springs and see the awesomeness 🙌🏼 manitou springs is right down the road and is supposed to be 2nd to Salem Massachusetts in the voodoo and dark culture. Btw, always love your videos. Thank you 🙏 🙌🏼💚
So is this the last episode of MMM? I really hope not. But if so i wish u luck in the dark histary people seem to like it.
Ohhhh my gosh thank you !!!!!!  Enjoyed this immensely,,,, no one does this better than you !!!!!!🤩🤩🤩
WHERE ARE YOU!??!!??
I miss when we heard “I’m here for you EVERY Monday!” Girlfriend, we need you ♥️♥️♥️
Where are the Monday videos?? I miss you mondays and Thursday
girl you need to do jon benet ramsey im curious on how you see that also andrea yates
Its Valentine's Day! Yay
I am blown away that you covered this story. I actually got sentenced to prison when I turned 21 and was in Denver Women's Correctional Facility with Jenn and honestly, she helped me a lot.   I was released from prison 3 years later and was in a parole therapy class with Bryan. I never knew the whole story so this video was wild to hear!
All stories of true crime the main people and couples involved are described as kind, sweet, would do anything for anyone, loved by everyone, beautiful, just perfect with smiles that will light up the room.. 😂 I mean that definitely can be the case but imagine them being described the complete opposite?
has bailey posted anything since Jan? I hope IM not missing them!  I LOVE MM&M's!
not her dying on my birthday
Bailey, we miss you so much on Mondays! I hope you find all the peace & happiness, as you deserve it! Can't wait to see your beautiful face again for MM&M Mondays!
SLAPPING MEATS TOGETHER, BAILEY?
When do we get a new MMM?
plllllease do kelly anne bates😀🙏
She died a day before my birthday :0
Bailey! I <3 you and miss your Murder Mystery Makeup videos sooooo much!!! Sending you good vibes and can't wait for your next one!
Take time for your self care Bailey. We are all here for you and thinking of you.
Please do the case of Dorothea Puente
We Love and support you girl. Missing our  chats
Are you still making MMM or is it only dark history now? I love it all, I just want all content you are willing to share 😊
Hey, loved the video! There's a brazilian man named Julio Santana, he killed almost 500 people and only spent one day in prison. There's a movie about him on Netflix, it's called "O nome da morte" (The name of death). It's a very interesting history that i almost didn't believe it was true. It would be very nice if you did a video about him. Kisses from Brazil ❤️🇧🇷
We miss you Bailey! Hope you’re doing ok…just know you got tons of ppl in your corner who love you!
What ever happened to the kids and Jenifer ex husband
I kinda believe she made it up about Brian but that insurance thing is pretty suspish
Wow, Jennifer was really drinking that koolaid.
Where are youuuuuu 😫
Did Bailey break up with us lol…. I feel ghosted 😢😂
I don't know how many times I've rewatched this particular case. But thank you Bailey for making so many of us look foward to Mondays ❤
When are you back Bailey?
Okay but why do people smile in their mugshots 😭
When are you coming back? It’s been a month and you said you were gonna make more videos. I’m missing my Monday routine.
Hope this isn't the last MMM.  :/
*le sigh... if it weren't for the podcast I'd probably give up hope of there ever being another M4.
So are you doing these every week or every month because I can only find those you did months ago and nothing like of the recent weeks.  Also you should definitely look up on Mailoni Brothers from Zambia. Would love to see you do more international stories.
I THINK,  You look better,  All Naturãl,  (Maybe make breakfast instead of doing make-up) But Whatever ... Great job on the videos ... I enjoy them ...
Fingers crossed for an upload today 🥺
You should do "The Case Of The Papin Sisters"
I would love and appreciate a Papin Sister video (: please and thank you (:
Ted bundy please!!
Please can you do Melanie McGuire
Whenever you come back... there's a cold case just solved in Pennsylvania solved 58 years later. Marise Chiverella. If ya want. Just throwing it out there.
If you continue doing these, you should do Bruce McArthur
Just ordered from wickedclothes for the first time….CAN WE SAY EXCITED…. Will fit right in with my Suspish sweater:)
This is my hometown
Do Clifford Olson next!!
They should both sentenced to prison for life 🙈..
Girl where are you at I know you’re getting more followers I hope you’re not one of those Youtubers the minute they get followers they think they don’t have to care about being consistent I mean I know you have a life but  same time this is your job I said that only because I know Someoneis  going to say something  We miss you
teheh i live in colorado springs. very beautiful
You can only charge people for what is allowable by law. The jury hears thee instructions before deliberating..
They both should have gotten life. I love you Bailey!
Bailey, have you done a story on Selena Quintanilla-Pérez?
She clearly isnt back has she stopped doing mmm?? What happened to monday uploads? Seems to be all about dark history
Can you look into LLDM / LA LUZ DEL MUNDO / LIGHT OF THE WORLD, it's a Christian Mexican cult!
The way Jennifer is smiling in the Mug shot, says it all that she's not that innocent as she was claiming. Cuz if it was all manipulation and then after realising that,a normal gullible person would be traumatized. Well... both of them almost got what they deserved.
You disappeared again!!! I NEED a new mystery and makeup Monday!!!!!
I’m so in sync 😭😭 especially when I’m high gosh …..
I love your videos! You are absolutely stunning😍 I love this look 😍and I believe they both should’ve been charged
Okay.  But is your theme song the song Paris and Nicole would always sing in the simple life  If not it must be fate
Hey girl you should tell us the story of Belle Gunness Please Please please  I hate riding but I love listening to you
I miss this series! You got me watching re-runs 😜
please do the Diana Downs case Bailey
Hi I just discovered you the other day on Spotify and fell in love. I listen to you while working. I'm from Jacksonville florida originally from Massachusetts.  Just wondering if you ever did a story on the infamous lizzie borden?? Her story happened in my home town of fall river Massachusetts
What if Brian is watching this video with us 😂 Isn't that weird 😳
I absolutely love your videos! You’ve made Monday’s far more enjoyable for me! I have a case that may interest you! This happened in my hometown in Texas. The killer’s name is Levi King. His actions had a very hard impact on our community. Even if it’s not something for a video, I think you may find his story interesting to read. Can’t wait for the next upload girl! 🤍🤍
I know you won't see this but there is a case of this girl called Mary Bell, I am not sure if you have done this case before but it seems interesting, she was a 11-year-old k!ller but it looks cool
I’m only 2 mins into the video but yes your hair does look amazing 👌🏻👌🏻
I love these types of stories, will you be making any more?
Man....Bailey saying my name "Jennifer" a bunch of times kept making my ears perk up lol
I actually love this so much
Please tell me what clips you have in your hair!!! I want them😁
Where are you???
Please do BTK
My grandma introduced me to Bailey. Thanks Grandma.
Bailey!!! Can you PLEASE do a m m & m on Jack Barron??? he killed his entire family in Elk Grove, California and it’s an INSANE story. Also, fun fact, my dad worked with him and called him in for work the same night he killed his wife; and his response is chilling when my dad found out and called him about it and after my dad giving his condolences, Jack’s response was “Oh yeah, thanks. Bye!” Please! It’s SUCH an intriguing story and I want the world to know. Love your videos. Hope you see this, and remember, stay safe lol xoxo.
why does brian kinda look like cole sprouse
Do “the lovely bones “ case
I’ve watched every episode and I’m pretty sure she has not covered Joseph Edward Duncan III. Bailey, this is one worth looking into!!!!
Is she not uploading more than once a month on this channel anymore?
Slapping meats 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭 I’m dead
Could you do a story of the Mary bell case??
If this happens to me and my brother is going to help defend my husband who cause this to happen to me. You know imma come back and haunt my brother. Lol
Is she like done with MMM and just sticking to dark history?
Why does he look ecstatic to be getting a mug shot? 😃
Baaaaileyyyy where are you?!?!?!?

Was this the final episode, have you stopped uploading?
You should do the Gabriel Fernandez case one day
Blue is your color please wear it more often you look you belong in the 🌊 ocean😍 you hair is absolutely cute 🥰

Bailey hoping you're ok girl. We love you ❤
Bailey, would it be possible for you to do a video on Bruce McArthur sometime in the future? A couple episodes on Catching Killers took me for a ride
She never announced a break? It’s like over a month since this video.
Hey girl ❤️
ASU in San Angelo, Texas where i'm from!! Thats neat!
When Bailey said “We got a streaker?!!” I immediately thought of Will Farrell in Old School 😂😂😂

Could you talk about Dean Corll? I’ve never heard anyone talk admit him before
Bailey impersonates G-d! 😂
Beyond love the videos! You total rock! I have one for you! If you have done it I missed it. Amy Bosley from Kentucky! She killed her chimney sweep husband! This story has it ALL! You would rock it out!
gtood show
I hope Brian doesn’t try to come after you!!
Hey! I don’t know if you’re taking suggestions but the case of Michael Houseweart's, it’s kinda recent but it happened close to where my girlfriends from! We love watching your videos❤️
Heyyy are you okk!?? Where are the new videos hunnie bunnie..
Can you please do England Yorkshire ripper. Also, you’re an absolute icon🥵❤️
This may seem random… But do we know if Bailey invented her theme song? I swear I’ll never understand algorithms but somehow Paris Hilton popped up on my feed and she and a friend were singing baileys theme song in the same voice and everything and I was so confused lol alsoooo I need those butterfly clips in my life pls and thanks 🦋
Bailey, I expected you to say, “girl, make better choices!”
Bailey, I think your videos are absolutely adorable and perfectly imperfect. Nobody is perfect but as you say, you do your best and that is what matters. I see NOTHING wrong with you or your vids or make up, filler or tox, (brought up in past vidoes) WHO CARES what haters say or think! Hey, they're thinking of you.. So what does that say? Who's winning? You are. Love your videos!! And how you put yourself into them. XOXO hope you see this... I doubt it.
So is she completely giving up on these and I should just unsubscribe or what? I’m not a fan of her newest project with dark history.
Is MMMM over?
Can you do a story on Sharee Miller?
Can you do one on Richard speck please please please
So here is a case that intrigues me, because I was the same age as the victims and it was local. Ward Weaver Miranda Gaddis & Ashley Pond.
brian’s mugshot is so scary and weird lol
You should talk about the West Memphis Three!
Hey Bailey, you should check out the Angie Housman case. This is was a literal shadow on my entire childhood. It happened very close to where I grew up and the details are horrifying. They recently caught the guy with new dna evidence but it took decades to solve.
When she said hiiii, how are you???? made me think of Jefree Star. it was as cringe for me, for sure, but I love her do it slide.
Not you saying you’re back and you still been gone 🥺🥺🥺
You should do Dorothea Puente if you haven't already
🤔🤔🧐🧐🤔🤔  Anybody know why Bailey hasn't been posting any M, M, MU episodes here on FB?!? 🤔🤔
Samuel Little! 😯 crazy crazy! I love your videos and theme song is my favorite 🤩
Love the makeup. and the story.
i'd love to hear you do the story of Laurie Show
You should look into Larry Eyler
Me watching this from Co Springs. •_•
I live there!
The muggies 🙄 they were so proud of what they did
Still requesting Theresa knorr also herb baumeister .
Girl where did ya go!!?? Missing your videos!
I'm here again because Bailey has gone MISSING from MMM!
DO ONE ON SAM LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO ONE ON SAM LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO ONE ON SAM LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO ONE ON SAM LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO ONE ON SAM LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO ONE ON SAM LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO ONE ON SAM LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO ONE ON SAM LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO ONE ON SAM LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO ONE ON SAM LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bailey, Peacemaker was gun from late 1800’s. US Army used it and popular for gunslingers and town sheriffs. Thus the ‘Peacemaker’
I don’t understand why people didn’t help Diane while Jennifer was recocking the gun.  I’m pretty sure that would’ve given erm time to pull her away n attack the shooter to prevent any further harm
You are awesome Bailey. Really enjoy your content.
So I keep coming here to look for new episodes, and I keep gettting this New Year one on top, which is from January 2022. I can't find anything newer and it's been a month. It will say "updated yesterday" or "updated today" at the bottom of the vid but nothing is new. I know she took some space for a personal issue after this January one, but can anyone tell me if I'm just not looking in the right place? I worry about her <3
can you pleaseeee do richard trenton if you haven’t already
Love her content! Always on point!! And I gotta say I cannot get over how gorgeous she is!! She is naturally beautiful! Una mujer muy hermosa!!! ❤️🙏🏼😍😍
Hello! I wasn’t sure how I could recommend a topic, so I just decided to write it here. Canadian Cult leader Roch Thériault was quite a persona. I had to research him for a school project a long time ago, his story might interest you for a futur video. I know you prefer talking about lesser known stories… I really enjoy your channel, it’s getting me through rough times 😊
Has Bailey done the Kristin Smart case?
Are you ever going to do makeup mystery Mondays anymore
Would love one on Clark olofsson! Verry interesting and they say that with him events resulted in the creation of the phrase Stockholm syndrome. There is gonna be a Netflix documentary on him to!
Hey Bailey …. Can you please do the case of Luka magnnota ? Love you girl  🤩
Take all the time you need, girl. We all love and support you. *hugs from Maryland*
Dude,is anyone else annoyed at the amount of copy cat you-tubers coming up on the feed
When you come back from taking some much needed time, please do the story on Carrie lawson!!
Could you do a video on the West Memphis Three?
Hi. I was just wondering if you were going to be making anymore M, M&M videos?
love how u spelled o r g instead of saying org <3
Bailey, New mystery and make-up when? 🥺
BTK
Just wondering when we will be getting another mmmm!? I miss you!
My daughter and I love watching you Bailey! Suggestions for something you should check out and maybe do a segment on is The Ant Hill Kids Cult...if you dare! It's pretty horrific, disgusting and unbelievable.  It's also really sad what these people endured.
Girl friend, we miss you and MMM, hope you are back at it soon. Monday's aren't the same without Bailey!
Isn’t the theme song you sing from “The Simple Life” I think Paris and Nicole used to sing the same song a lot like 20 years ago.
You really are a beautiful woman
How come she hasn’t posted another video yet ? Jw
John Brennan Crutchley is a case that I haven't heard a lot about but his crimes took place in the next town from me, and I would love to hear your take on it!
Ahmad Suradji
Todd Kolhep. Please Bailey.
Can you please make a video about Dorothea Puento?❤️❤️❤️
It’s been four weeks Bailey !!! Unacceptable !!! We neeeed you
No pressure, just wish you'd update us here on the YT platform, what is up and all that...
I’m pretty sure the peace maker means you’ll have peace because your nemisis is DEAD!
I’ve been here so long I know all the words to the theme song 🥰🤩
I say this story on ID. But hey just gotta say, you are so Gorgeous, call Me.... j/k but love your videos.
You are so adorable
Please, don't end this series?
I always say "Why do you gotta grab Jesus's flip flop and drag Him into this " lol 😆
I’ve got to know where you got those purple hair clips! I’ve seen them in several videos and I love them!
Hi Bailey I was wondering if you could look into and possibly do a dark history video about Marie Ferree ( the name is spelled many different ways) she’s my ancestor and there a very interesting story behind her and it was something we didn’t talk about in school but there was a major movement that she started
can anyone tell me if she has done: "The Boy In The Box"? because that story caught my interest, i haven't read it yet because i don't want any spoilers if she has, or hasn't. (the reason the story caught my interest because there is a song called "Man in the box" and i really like the song)
Heya! Idk if you'll actually see it but you should cover this Nicholas Barclay case from texas! That is INSane!!!!!!
Is Bailey only uploading Monday’s episodes on podcast these days instead of on YouTube?
Hey idk if you have ever done a video on the hello kitty case but if you haven’t I think you should really make a video on it
Bailey you remind me of Erica Durance in this makeup you're wearing. She played Lois Lane in the TV series Smallville. You are so beautiful and a very engaging storyteller. ❤️
Just got my Bailey Sarian T-Shirt. I love it ❤️now I can wear it with pride here in Australia 🇦🇺
I love how I live in Colorado Springs and it’s not cute and little. it’s wack and expensive
You should do the columbine high school masacre
Tamla Honsford - please do.
When she says “witnesses” I’m like why didn’t they stop him?!?
Brian: *literally commits adultery* Also Brian: “iT wAs GoD’s WiLL!”
Hey Bailey.  I was wondering during of you could to a take on nikko jenkins.  And give us your thoughts.
Has anyone else ever picked up on where your theme song comes from?  Because I know,  and it makes me love you even more. 😄
The theme song always reminds me of the grinch singing (the one w jim carry)😂
I am a bit late, I know... But maybe you could talk about the Vampire of Nuremberg (Kuno Hofmann)? That'd be so great :D
I’m going to ask you on every platform will you tell the story of micheal and heather jones
We love and miss you Bailey
We miss you Bailey ❤️ but take all the time you need! Sending all my love and support! I’m sorry you’re going through tough times :(
Thought you were back??? Monday disappeared from the calendar?
I love your show so much. I have had chronic anxiety for the past few months and playing your videos literally helps me so much in terms of productivity. Cleaning, showering, working out… everything. Love you so much
Please please please do the Skylar Neese case!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’d love to see your take on the Skyler Neese case. May she Rest In Peace. ❤️
Girl. I need an upload! I’m withdrawing. Save me.
Jack the ripper!!! Please do both of the Jack the ripper and the Ripper!
Please do Albert fish
the way my mom gave birth to my sister in colorado springs while stationed at fort carson🥴 🥴
I want to know where has she been it been a month she said she would be back in January I’m not talking dark history month what is she doing where is she at
Bailey we miss u we need u u helped me thru the greatest depression in my life but i know u are human too and i hope u get better🦋sending virtual hugs🦋
“How could they be sooo dumb?” LOL I love how Bailey tells every story because I’m saying those same things too as I listen.
WE LOVE YOU BAILEY PLEASE FEEL BETTER SOON. YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL SOUL AND WE ALL MISS YOU💜💜💜
Oh Bailey, well hello there. I just wanted u to know I love watching ur crime stories. Ur makeup is always so cute.i love love love watching u. And ur so funny too!😁 Great job girlfriend.
Aren't there going to be any more of these? Is is all going to be 'Dark History', now?
Where are you Bailey?! I miss seeing your beautiful face on Mondays! 😩 I hope you’re doing okay!
When is MMandMup coming back
Bailey we need a update on mom. We haven't seen her in forever
I can’t explain how much I look forward to Mondays. Please never stop!
I haven't been watching these true crime videos for long but I definitely love your style, the way you deliver the info. The side remarks, sarcasm, youthful giggles over names or words, all of it while doing your makeup.... takes some of the edge off. Anyway, I actually was going to comment to ask if you'd ever heard of or looked into the Molly Dattilo case? She went missing from Indianapolis, IN in 2004. The other case I would love to see you cover is Shanda Sharer. She died in January of 1992 in Madison, IN,  she was 12 years old. It's a solved case, I'm not sure if you cover those, but even if you don't, check it out sometime on your own..... it just blows my mind what people are capable of.
Slapping meats together 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hope all is well with you.
Hey, is this over? I noticed you haven’t done a new one in like 3 weeks so I was curious if this series was finished 😥. I hope not. But whatever is going on I hope your well.
Please can you talk about Genie Wiley. Her dad locked her in a dark room for 13 years that's all I know for know.
Hurry up ! QUEEN BEE 🐝  WE NEED NEW EPSIDOES HURRY WE MISS YOU 💜💜💜💯💯💯😇😇😇🦄🦄🦄⭐⭐⭐
They found the smoking gun? No pun intended?
Can you do one on Steven Avery?!
I would love if you can make your videos kid friendly without the curse words. My kids saw me watching you one day and I had to tell them they couldn’t watch your videos:(.
Wishing you well Bailey, take care of yourself and know that showing up for yourself is just as important as showing up for your fans. Sending you healing qi.
😲😲Its so weird to hear you say Colorado springs I've lived there my whole life so I was super excited for this one
Hey, when are you coming back?
I don’t know if you have done an episode on this, but I just seen something about Susan Powell ..... I don’t know if it’s solved yet.... but seems interesting. Watched something on diesel brothers
When’s the next video :(
Have you stopped doing these? I love these. Yes dark history is cool but I love these and 1 month later we have nothing.  :-( where did you go bailey!
Am I missing her mmm? It seems a really long time since the last one?
Would you do a story about Judith Barsi? It’s the little girl that played duckie in land before time. But if it’s really sad don’t!
Can you do a video about Richard Paul White from Mesita Colorado?
There hasn’t been makeup Monday videos for a month now 😞
Hi Bailey, I really enjoy Monday show, but the show has not been on seems like forever. When will you be back? I love your shows Dark History has taught a lot of history that I did not know
What happened to their kids? Cps?
WHERE DID YOU GO?!?!
You should do an episode about Ronnie O'Neal. The guy who killed his children's mother, his 9 year old daughter and attacked his son. He acted as his own attorney. I wanna know more!!!
Make my Monday’s great again Bailey Sarian❤️😮‍💨🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Wheres your new one at bailey
Is MMM not a thing anymore? 😣
Where’s a new Video? It’s almost a month now
When can we expect some new video ?
I love your videos and how honest you are! You should do a video of your new house! We have missed you on Mondays, hope all is well!
Wish I could give you a big hug and lots of chocolate ice cream, sorry to hear you're having such a rough time 💜💙
Bailey where are you on Mondays 😭
Bailey! Where you at? It's been a month! We miss you!
They should both have gotten life in prison no parole!!! Sorry not sorry. Their poor babies, left with no parents now!
Every Monday I check ur channel like every five mins bc I’m so excited for a post lol. Love u!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The brother was probably gona get some money from the life insurance money!
I have a suggestion for a video you can do I’d love to hear more about! It’s the Bigham story from South Carolina.
Are we not doing these anymore ? 😭
Bailey I LOVE you and this series, could you possibly do one on Tom Brown who went missing in Canadian, TX? MYSTERYYYYYYY
My cousin had lupus.  Many black women get diagnosed with Lupus and Sickle Cell Anemia.  RIP big Cuzzo
Came here to appreciate the hair. 😉
We miss u
Are we getting anymore of these or just dark history from now on
You should look into the Luka Magnotta case!!!
Hope ur well Bailey!
Haha, slapping their meats together 😂
Do Holly Bobo’s case 🙏🏻
Can you do the rat man?
Always amazing videos I have a request!! Ed gein!! The Texas chainsaw massacre guy ! I finally just started watching the movies for the first time and GIRRRLLL 😳😬
Bailey! Do the story of Charles NG and LEonard Lake!! They’re from my hometown! Not a well known story!
Please do one on the boston strangler!!
I honestly think that they both planned it. I don't think the girl was manipulated, but that they were equal partners.
Plz watch.  Netflix. Crime scene.  Cecil hotel
can you do a story about the Texas chainsaw massacre??
The poor children!
Bailey do a vid on Albert fish
Colorado Springs I wonder it Lt. Kenda was the investigating officer
Bailey can you cover the Roxanne Frike, I was at the grocery store where and when she was killed. I went in with friends and came out to the police and crime scene tape. The community embraced her family, her husband was in the Navy. It was unsolved but years later there was a TWIST.
My hood! Colorado Springs is great!
Dearest B….. you’re in my prayers.  Life is too hard sometimes, but you’re tough. Your fans will be here, when you are ready to post more videos.💋
The hellofresh code didn't work for me. I tried 2 different times using Bailey's code and Sherrilyn Dale's code and cancelled both because I talked to an agent over an hour and at first she said it was for new customers only, when I told her I was a new customer she said that they added a discount to my account and couldn't add another one....ooook I cancelled. Then when I tried to use Sherrilyn's code they said the code was "expired" I talked to an agent again and got no where. I did tell them the youtube community needs to know the code doesn't work and her response "I will let my supervisor know there's a lot of people 'confused' about the promo codes" Ha I'm not confused! I just wanted everyone to know and please let me know if you have succeeded in ordering with a code How on earth did you do it!?
How about Shawn Grate?
Karma baby. It’s Karma
Can you do a MMM about the Sun Gym Gang? Because that is just insane and OF COURSE it happened in Miami-Dade County. Criminals there just are a different breed.
Can you explore the mysterious death of Shalimar Seiuli? Nothing added up from what I’ve read.
Ann no other reason why not to trust religion.
Can you do one on Dorothea Puente!
Can you do the Ronnie O’Neal case
Josef fritzl 👹☠️💩🤯🤬 his crime went actually worldwide. Do a video on him maybe
Hi Bailey, I was wondering if anyone brought this up as a suggestion but the case of Junko Furuta was so heartbreaking and I feel like she was forgotten in Japan. I love your videos and wanted to make a suggestion.
HELLO KITTY CASE
Can you PLEASE talk about the Jonbenet Ramsey case!!
Can you do a video on the Lindbergh baby?? I've heard about it before, but I don't know much about it. It would be really interesting.
Please do Jennifer Dulos missing case!
Bailey’s back!!!  Whoop!!
HH Holmes
Can you do the Susan Powell case pleaseeeeee
Your foundation literally is so flawless in this video I might need It 😅😅😅
I just saw that the Menéndez brothers are back together in prison! Crazy story! Any way you can do their story?
This was so weird to watch. My name is Jennifer and when you called "Jennifer? Jennifer?" I was confused for a second 😂
Love you! Need more merch!!!!
Both should’ve got life
I love binge watching these videos thank you Bailey for the hours of entertainment while I clean!  I’m not sure but I don’t believe I’ve seen a video on the Cleveland house of horrors with Michelle knight Gina dejesus and Amanda berry ???
Would love for you to cover H H Holmes & the muder castle! Tried looking up if you have but I'm not seeing it anywhere
Yaa missed you!
You should have a look at Dorothea puentte
I grew up In the springs. It’s a pretty cute town and Pikes peak is Incredible (obvi). But it is very conservative. There was a massacre in the south side of the springs last year. Terrible.
She says peacemaker I think of supernatural
Bailey can you do China Arnolds story!
Bailey please do a Video on nikki kuhnhausen in Vancouver Washington her story needs to be heard
On Mondays you said? Once every couple of months? I thought three Mondays in a row one week off I'm confused about the new schedule.
where the kids?
Please do Bobby Joe Long 😭😭😭😭🤌🏼
I just love your videos. Your description and thought process is always immaculate lol love you!!!
Hi Bailey, please can you do the Vienna strangler? 😊
Hi Bailey can you do a story on Brianna Lopez “Baby Brianna” from Las Cruses NM?
Bailey! I hope they ask you to go on the Netflix show Murderville! You’d be a perfect guest!
I take your closing questions seriously so here’s my input; manipulated or not Jennifer still killed someone and she should’ve served her full sentence but karma got her in the end. Brian is released??? Someone who plotted his loving and sick wife’s death? Just wow.
Bailey! I love you and I hope you are doing well 💖 I just came across the most interesting story I would LOVE to see you cover (whenever you're ready💕)   I'm not sure if you've read the story of the Sodder family? In 1945 on Christmas Eve, the family home was burned down, 4/9 children and the parents were able to escape - but the remaining 5 children did not make it out nor were their remains ever found.. The whole case is suspish af and my first thought was oh man, I would love to hear Bailey cover this!  sending you loving vibes as always! 💗
You have NEVER been to CO Springs!!!!!!?? :O Love your channel btw uwu
I love her smile it makes my day tbh <3
Please look up and do a show of pamela hupp
Not me listening to you while shaving my legs ciwkdjked
Will you pls cover the case of Justine Johnson a woman in michigan that killed her 3 year old.
Can you please do mmm on Diane Downs??
Please tell the Hart Family crime!  May those kids Rest In Peace
Where have you beeenn!?!?!! It's been three weeks bb
Being from a town of 4,000 makes 250k laughable. 😆
The governor commuted her sentence so the prison system didn't have to pay for any more medical treatment.
They both were equally guilty. Both of them should rot in jail.
Bailey where are you 😩 I need my fix 😂🙈
My 13th reason is not seeing a MMMM every Monday 🥲
How do I get to keep up with your videos or podcast
Should've kept guns like that so either someone might get away OR like I said change their minds n have calmed a bit. Hmm I wonder
That is a very painful cancer.
They both should have spent the rest of their life in jail!
Bailey, when are you posting another MMMM???
I remember being so obsessed with bailey's videos that i watch it everyday even when i'm doing chores. My mom heard her talking and scolded me for listening to something "demonic" (that was when i was watching the cult leader😂 i forgot his name lol). I stopped when i caught up to her videos. I'm glad i can watch something new now. I miss you bailey
Not Angelo State a MAJOR party school now... Located in San Angelo, TX
It always is the husband.
I would love for you to talk about Btk!
Please do a video on Brandon Lawson from San Angelo,  TX he went missing in 2013 and his remains were found yesterday in the same spot that was supposedly searched multiple times.
Can you talk about the “Chino Hills Massacre - Kevin Cooper case”
It was called the peacemaker by the common man, since it made them equal.
Sat here..........patiently waiting for a new M.M&MM.  I get this is the poor cousin an you dont loves us as much as the D.H but Bailey come on.............. we have needs!!
Hi Bailey! There are soooo many comments, you probably won't see this. But I think it would be interesting to hear your take on Danny Rolling the Gainesville Ripper! I know you're busy. I hope you have a great day! 😁❤
Jen was the person who actually pulled the trigger, so her punishment should’ve been more severe.  The worse the crime, the longer the time.
This is it. I finally caught up. Over the past few months I’ve binged all of Bailey and Boze’s true crime content. Now I’m fully caught up.. what am I gonna do now? 😭
You should do the Fritzl case
Could you do one about the case of karlie guse
Hey, Bailey! Love watching your videos and listening to your podcasts, I look forward to each new episode. I’d love to hear your take on the sad case of Karissa Boudreau and her awful mother. Take care and hope you are doing well.
Can you please do one about Robert the Doll I think it's a cool story and it really happened the movie Chucky is based on it
Just a little FYI lol cocking the gunn is just a matter of pulling the hammer back, it's doesn't take a long time. You can shot off the whole 6 chambers then reloading time varies with skill
This is what we in the church call a wolf in sheep's clothing. How gross
Suggestion for another story....Michelle (Shelly) Knotek. I read a book "If You Tell" by Gregg Olsen recently about the case and would LOVE to hear more about it! Especially with your amazing way of telling true crime stories!!!   Thanks Bunches!
i'm not sure if bailey will see this but i have two stories that i highly recommend for you to check out. i am from australia so there was this case at the beginning of this year about a missing child who was later found dead in a barrel of sand at in bushland at the hands of her stepfather. second, "christina dacara", this story blew up in january 2021 philippine news because of how astonishing this case was and i still cannot get over the verdict of it. i love your videos so much and look forward to them all the time, thank you for all of your hard work and i hope you have been taking care of yourself <3
Can we get a hair tutorial pleeeease 😩❤️‍🔥
Did you forget about us on Mondays? My heart can’t take anymore!
Can you do one on Josh Powell?!
According to Reflexology and the Spirit, the pancreas represents giving and receiving love as well as digesting situations you find yourself in. 🤯😱 That’s WILD!
Can you please please please list what brushes you use? 🙏🥺
if you haven’t already done it do jamie osuna
Dorothea Puente plsss
Already starting off wild! I have lupus!
I love you Bailey 💚🇧🇷
Look up Clay shrout
Where’d all the Monday releases go?
love your videos SO much! i listen to your podcasts every time I drive! i would love to hear an episode on paul bernardo and karla homolka. the ken and barbie killers
Where do I recommend a case that I would like her to cover? I thought she had said in one of her videos to post it somewhere in particular, not just in the comments. I'd love to hear her cover the JonBenet Ramsey case. I know it has been very heavily covered over the years in numerous ways but no one does it like Bailey. If anyone could tell me where I need to suggest this at so Bailey sees it please let me know. Thanks.
“Kitty Kats” 😂
Ok so I found this episode very funny for my husband and I. In the first 3-4 minutes you mentioned Colorado Springs and ASU (Angelo State university), my husband and I are from Colorado Springs (married there) and then we lived in San Angelo for a couple months too. Too close to home for us haha
you are sooo entertaining love the execution of your story
Do one on dorothea puente!
PLEASE DO CONRAD ROY AND MICHELLE CARTER!!
Are you planning a new video soon?  I look forward to my Mondays but it has been a while now.
You're back but only 1 video all month :( you're my fave and miss your videos.
I love you bailey 😘
Can you do a video on the Tara Grinstead case in Georgia? It’s an interesting case for me as there were no suspects for 11 years. But it is now solved.
Look up: Ronnie O’Neal, He killed his girlfriend with a shotgun and disabled daughter with a hatchet.
Jennifer ended up getting her sentenced reduced. She was paroled in 2011 and died 3 months later :/
Have you ever done a story on Warren Jeff's?
Can you do Aileen Wuornos? I wanna know the story im dying !!!! But i want you to tell it 😂❤
Have you talked about Sam Little? I don’t think I’ve seen him and I think that would be interesting
I went on YouTube to get me some Bailey this rainy day 😁😄🧠👀☕🌧
That’s not why it’s called the peacemaker Bailey 😂 but we love the your optimism and pacifism.
Could you do a story on the Susan Powell case?! It’s sad and an unsolved mystery, but so interesting.
also ilysm i'd love to hear you talk about randy kraft!
BAILEYYYYY COME BACK🥺
It's crazy she can remember this? I highly doubt she's reading a teleprompter.
Curious if you would look into Marcus Wesson. There is a book on it with details & pictures.
Please check out the Mark Hobson story!
I NEED bailey to do a cult case
a population of 250,000 is considered a small town??? 😭
Bryan watching her at 32:01 👁👄👁
Is she done w MMM? Seems like there’s only DH …
Can you do an episode in the disappearance of Daniel Robinson
This is calming me down in class because I really want to throw, my binder and pencil box at these 2 kids
Love the hair, Bailey you look so so pretty.
Can you do the Dorothy Puente case
Hey!! Can you cover the Jessica Groves case? It’s a shocking one! The prosecutor actually yells during the trial!!
I would love for you to tell the story of dorothea puente! I never heard about here til just now from TicTok
Well I’m a dude & I’m definitely not here for the makeup. But I’am here for your True Crime Story Telling. I think you do a great job Brodette. Peace✌🏻
Can you pleeeease do Teresita Basa's case? It's so interesting

And the police were like ✨yay✨ 😂😂😂
True crime in the format of HOT GOSS
Bailey  I miss MMM ?????? Why just Dark History? 😪
Can yu please do menendez twins🥺🤝
I think she was manipulated
Can you do the real life AHS
Ok, I live in the springs. No ma'am,  we are not totally religious. Not a small town. Wasn't one back in the 80's and 90's either. Lol. Still love watching you though. ❤️
Can you please do a video covering Ronnie O Neal
I wubba you soooooooo much. And we all miss you sooooo much. Can’t wait till your back. 🥺❤️!!!! No pressure. Just wanted to let you know that we aren’t going anywhere and we all love you so much and we will always be here to support you and wait for you to feel better. I remember after a break up once it took me forever to feel like my old self again. But then again that was a toxic young mess lol and I’m hoping this was a mutual break up for your sake. Time will heal everything love and we’re all here for you and rooting for you. And I know it may be really too soon for this but you are Seriously the freaking coolest gorgeous ambitious just bad mamma JAMA and if you are going to get everything you want in this life anymore and if that includes a new man you deserve to be treated like the queen you are. We love you so much Bailey come back when you’re ready
Bailey! It’s been three weeks! We miss MMMM!
Can we talk about Dennis DePue the real life jeepers creepers?
Is MMM coming back? I miss it! 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Where you been Bailey?
I just came across the Ronnie O’Neal case. It’s absolutely insane. Such a gross human. It’s such a roller coaster of emotion.
Pleas please did a video on Brian Laundrie and Gabby Petito.
you should do the Dorothea Puente case next!!
Baileeyyyy please do story on the old lady Dorothea puente pleaseeee
Bailey, we miss you, it’s been 3 weeks, hope you’re ok 🥺 missing my favorite girl and my favorite show 🥺
So, they did that because they were close to him. They just lost their loved one. Accepting that Brian helped, would be having to lose two loved ones. And accept that they loved him like family and he took HER away
I’m from a small town in Alabama and unfortunately there was a woman who went missing YEARS ago named carrie lawson! Her body was never found, and it’s just one big mystery!

aaron guerrero & sierra halseth: two star crossed teenage lovers torn apart by the 16 year old girls fathers unapproval of her 18 year old boyfriend 🙄 so the two of them devise a plan to run off into the sunset together it would only require some knife sharpening and maybe a bucket of bleach. (True story)
"They really didn't even try that hard" to hide their affair. And for some reason that's when I just couldn't stop laughing.
SO much love for you girl, from South Africa. <3 Hope to see lots of you this year.
Hmmm. This story sounds so familiar to me. Sounds kinda like hunger games kind of vibe 🙃
I’ve been watching you for years & i just came back to say, you’re really a trendsetter. Wow
I hope you are doing okay ! We miss you ! ❤️

I think the plan was to get rid of both of them. They were trying to set up Ben to take the fall by dressing in his clothes and using his gun. I think both are guilty.

That’s one messed up Christian! He’s the textbook example of why people think ALL Christians are hypocrites!  Let it be known that NOT ALL Christians who follow Jesus as their personal savior are anyyyyywhere near the likeness of this guy. 🤦🏻‍♀️....jus sayin
We miss you and hope you’re well above all else!
YOU'RE BACK!!!!!Yeah! I've missed you!!! 😎😍😎😍😎😍😎
I don’t know if you take video requests but I would love to hear you talk about the Dorothea puente house!!!

Its been 3 weeks bailey where are you😭
Just missing you these past two weeks. When will MMM be back?
I just love you! 😇
Where is Bailey
Im sure you’re already tracking the Lauren Smith-Fields case, but please help it get the exposure it deserves. Her case, and Brenda Lee Rawls. These women’s stories NEED to be heard and NEED the exposure.
Has MM&M moved to podcast only ?
Bailey whenever you take a break, i take a break lol. i’m just now playing this video. honestly i’m not sure, because everyone can be forgiven. we don’t hold any power of what can and cannot be done to people but we do have to stand up and make sure they get punished for doing wrong onto others. anyway, my heart goes out to Diane’s family. i’m thankful y’all were able to at least know the truth of why such a horrible incident would happen to your daughter/sister/mother/friend. 💞🌺🌸🌼🌻🌹🌷💐🌱🌳🥀🐚
Do Dorothea Puente!!
it's ALWAYS the husband
Have you done a video for dorothea puente?

Hiii Are you done doing Monday videos?

I would like to see you do an episode on Michelle Knotek, she is set to be released from prison this year.
Just saw a tiktok about Dorothea Puente and I NEED the whole run down from you! Reading about it on wiki is not the same!!!
CHINA ARNOLD CASE!
Both of them are quilty 😇
I just realized where I recognized the theme song from. Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie "Sill & Bill"
Sounds like Bryan & Jen's sentencing was a popularlarity contest. His family stood up for him, while her family condemned her. I guess no matter where u are, the most important thing is whether ppl like you or not 🤷🏼‍♀️
How do I find your Merch?
Bailey you should look into the Hailey Dunn case in Texas
BAILEY!!! Elisa Lam OR Hotel Cecil stories???
I suggest junkon furuta case.
Pls do the death house land lady!! Dorothea puente

Please do Dorothea Puente. I heard that her house has been called the “Death house” or something like that
Happy new year Bailey 🥰
I would love to see you do the bat winged liner for hooded eyes.... Pleeeaaasssee
bailey is just the best. thats my comment, bye bye now, have a great day

“are we in clue?!”😂😂
Can you do Ivan milat please
Have you ever covered Jon Benet Ramsey?
Do you have any comment on Wicked clothings issue with stealing peoples money and not shipping orders out??
As a Christian myself, this is DIS-GUS-TING, I hate when people try to manipulate the Bible to justify their wrong doing, he was more concerned with what the public would think, what a sociopath
you should check out the Elan School in Poland, ME!!!!
you should do the andy avalos and amber avalos case it’s so sad but so intresting
well done on your hair Bailey!! I know you've been workin' on it and we're all proud of you!
You Should Do A Video About The Guzman Case!! Really Crazy........
The life insurance policy could have been upped at Diane's request because she had lupus and that can result in a lot of medical bills which could be paid after her death with the life insurance policy.
Hi, much love from Holland ❤ special request: Jennifer Fairgate and Isdal Woman. X
“Slapping meats” had me rolling😭😂😂
this is my fav makeup look out of all ur vids
YOUR AWESOME
PLEASE PLEASE TALK ABOUT JUNKO FURUTA'S DEATH! 🙏🙏🙏🙏
BOOM SHAKA LAKA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I really expected her to be like "1989...... around the same time Taylor Swift was born"
I didn't hear a word you just said. I was too busy reminiscing about the 90s after seeing your butterfly clips.
You should talk about Joachim Kroll in one of your future videos 😊
More please 🥰 it cheers alot of people up
Bailey's in A Class by Her "Self"  Love Me Some Bailey!!!
Do Nithari case, India
I read a few times the "Peacemaker " got its nickname because it's leveled the field. It's ease of use and accessibility made it so many women and men of any size could use it
you should do a video on the menendez brothers
I went over to my mom house and I heard you lol I listened to you while in camp and she enjoyed it she loves your make up and we dont wear it but she said she loves your videos lol even my dad like to listen. Thanks for keeping her company she now has a empty nest
Can you do a video on Alison Botha please?
Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ah ah ahhh
Do a piece on Karen Greenlee
can you do the Marcus Wesson case or the The Wesson "family" massacre PLEASE!!!!!
Peacemaker??? As in the actual one used by Wyatt Earp himself???? It did have beautiful scroll work on it.
Do a video on Sylvia Seegrist
I think Brian told Jen about his plan and she stepped up and offered to do it. He obviously had plans to do it but because I don’t think she was really that manipulated she stepped up.
Babe you say what I am thinking 🤔
Not military spouses 😳🥲
Bailey! I love your channel. Have you done a MMM on Charles Whitman?
Please please please do Dorothea Puente ☺️
I would love to see you too a video on Albert Fish aka the Brooklyn vampire!!
@bailey I need you to check your dm
you should look into the Lauren Spierer case!!
What is that eye brow brush you used?! (The tilted one) 🖤
I live in CO Springs and it's not that small lol
i find it hard to see where/how ppl get offended by things you say lol 😂
I'm late to the party, but...JENNIFERRR! P.s. is it me or does Brian look like the dude from wishmaster?!
You should do the story of Bath Michigan 1927 school disaster.
You should do Sacco and venzetti… they were two men put to death on circumstantial evidence…
You are hilarious, i love your videos.
Do a video on Jason vukovich “the Alaskan avenger”
Peacemaker and slapping meats r cracking me up lolz 🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀
I just saw something about Mitchelle Blair's case, i've never heard about it before, but the first thing that came to my mind was how great it would be if you could talk about it. I love your work 😊
I freaking love you!! "Slapping meats" hahaha lol love it
Would love to see an episode on Abraham Thomas!
If you want another story look into Gerald Robinson of toledo Ohio
Can you do a video on Jeffrey Willis?
So I've been watching you for a while and I'm from Colorado Springs! This video hit a lot closer to home for me than just location.  My mom not only has Lupus like the woman in this video but her name is almost the exact same pronunciation both first and last.  Her initials are DH. She mistakenly gets called Diane as well.  My parents were high school sweethearts and moved out here when my dad got stationed here in 2003 so not long after Diane and her husband moved here.  Crazy creepy how many similarities there are.    I love your videos.  This video was definitely shocking in more ways than 1
As a Colorado springs native we are absolutely nothing like you described. It is a big military town but we don't act like that
I was wondering if you’ve covered the Jimmy Hoffa story. My ex-fiancé’s mother was friends with Steve Barr, one of the men who was connected with Hoffa’s disappearance…
I think you should do a video on the menendez brothers I feel it be a hit.
Maybe SHE manipulated HIM!
Brian is just as guilty as Jennifer. No doubt.
Is Jen the girlfriend or wife?, Cuz i thought that Bailey said a different name in the beginning ( the one diagnosed with Lupus) , Im confused! 🤔🤨😕
Can you please do one of the pickton farm in BC the pig farmer
Was Brian a friend of Chad Daybell?
Am I the only one missing this? 😭 Where is M M & M?
Does Bailey have a Patreon
To paraphrase the song from Chicago... They had it comin' They had it comin' They had no one else to blame.
Wonder where the kids are and if they forgave their father !
Ok, I would have fought when I saw his pants. Guys snatching purses don’t dress like that.
Jennifer wore her husbands clothes to get rid of him! Two birds one stone 😐
that 90s hair tho
Bailey, you are wonderful to listen too,except the big ol F bomb you been dropping an awful lot lately. Wish you had less of the F bomb thrown out there!!
“So the police are like … yay”
I missed you this week. Just finished listening to Dark History. Hope you are back Monday! I know you gotta take a break sometimes, I will always understand that.
It's incredibly unlikely that you'll see this, but if you do... I'm sending you nothing but love and light. I hate that you're going through a hard time. You're so friggin amazing and I feel like you don't realize it. You need to know how much love is being sent your way right now. 💞
Me laughs in uncomfortable because I'm from Colorado Springs 👁️👄👁️
Military spouse here, just moved to Colorado Springs 😳
the police are like  yay lol
Can you please do the case of the negromontes
There is an interesting story that I think you would absolutely LOVE called the 'Dyatlov Pass incident'. There are many, MANY theories around this incident but I have a feeling you would really enjoy it. It's one of my favs and I haven't seen many people cover it.
I'm from Colorado Springs and I had no idea about this 🤯 I mean it did happen 5 years before I was born, but whoa
I would love to see you do a story on Russell and Becky Porter from Springfield Mo
pls do china arnold case
The original detective that was on the case said they found the husband at his job and questioned him there on base. They found the peacemaker there, not the home.  Just watched this on Hulu on detective Joe Kenda.
Peacemakers are single action where you have to pull the hammer back each time to fire.
I know you weren't explaining what lupus was for the purpose of awareness, but I wanted to thank you anyway. I have lupus and when I was first diagnosed no one around me knew/understood what it was which made it difficult. So it means a lot hearing someone with a large following mention it, thank you!
Me living in Colorado Springs: 😀😬🤨
It’s called a peace maker because it kills bad people and creates peace 😊
Will you do a video on Susan Smith??
I was in prison with this lady, she is a born again Christian and has been released from prison last time I heard she had cancer
It's not a weird reaction when you are religious cuz you believe your loved one is with Jesus.
sin is sin. All sins can be forgiven except for the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit!
Super disappointing this series is on the back burner when I enjoy it so much more than dark history. Dont get me wrong dark history is still enjoyable but the og bailey fans need more makeup!
We need a hair tutorial vid!!!!
can u do jonbenet ramsey next? 🥰
31:20 😂😂😂
I’ve seen this episode on the ID channel with the main homicide detective who was working at this case you should check him out Bailey his name is Detective Joe Kenda he is a currently now retired detective but still works for the ID channel about old cold cases he used to work on.
So what you're saying is....it was the husband...by extension 🤣
Is  MMM over now???
Hey @Bailey, can you please cover the mystery case of brazilian model  Marina Ferrer?
Please please please do a video on the ant hill kids cult!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bailey can u do a video on the Romonov Family....plzzzzzzzz
I have lupus 😭👍
Tetsuya Ichihashi can you do Tetsuya Ichihashi 🥺
Who hangs out in a gym jacuzzi as friends!? Hahahahaha suspissshhh
Hey Bailey! Can you talk about the Wilmington massacre of 1898? Ive lived in Wilmington for 13 years and just recently learned about this horrific event in history. I think more people should know about these kind of things so we can work to not repeat history.
How tall was Jen?
I like to suggest a video on china arnold,
Your hair is so lovely
Do Lauren Smith Fields next!
I love all your videos but I'm more into these so far. Dark history is great, just not always my thing
Hi Bailey! I’ve been watching your videos since the beginning of 2020 and have been waiting for you to do a video on Luka Magnota from “don’t F*ck with cats” 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I was dying when she said "no, no, no lemme think... no"
“Peacemaker” because someone would take one look at that bad boy and decide to turn tail and run!  The baddest gun of it’s time.
I love your vids!!!!! keep going
a big question I have is, did he take out the life insurance policy on her because he was conspiring to have her killed, OR was it because she was diagnosed with Lupus?
Did I miss an announcement that bailey was skipping the next few Mondays? 😭
Where'd you get the butterfly clips? I'd love to do my daughter's hair with them:) so far she likes half down, half space bun with bows
You should do the story of the White Witch in Jamaica! If you ever get the chance to visit Jamaica, you need to go to the White Witch house! It's super creepy! They say the house is still haunted
Setting spray to the mouth 👄 😝🤣
Bailey we miss your stories. 😭
I love how, whenever she gets happy, she just: 🐱‍🐉
I love you but your intro is too long
Hey!!! Colorado Springs viewer! Today, colorado Springs is a little boring, but the rest of Colorado is fun!
Love your stories! Can't wait for the next one. Patiently (that's a lie) waiting. 😍🤩😍
You’re so lovely 🦚that beauty
its been two weeks do we get another story next week? I'm feigning
I listen, I don't watch you, and I looked at the video and thought you had brass knuckles in your hair...I realized I was wrong. lol
The hair IS FRICKIN GORGEOUS. WOULD LOVE AND APPRECIATE A TUTORIAL IF YOU WOULD BLESS ME WITH ONE PLEASEEE?🥺🥺😍😍😍
please do the story of oj
slappin' meats...
Do you ever link your makeup??
Can you do the story about the “ant hill kids” it’s wild lol Roch Theriault is the cult leader
You should totally talk about the Betty Broderick case I think you would love it we are doing it at my school as a mock trial and it really interesting to learn about
bailey you gotta cover the jack the ripper case!!
Can you do Selena's story?
Are those butterfly hair clips? Why is that making me so happy?
So glad to see you back Bailey!!! 😘😘❤️
22:06 ✨Slapping meats together✨
Can you possibly do an episode about The Zagłębie Vampire, Zdzisław Marchwicki??!!🧛🏻‍♂️ Btw. I love you, Bailey!!!❤️‍🔥
Can you do the story about Phillip Chism, a teenage high school student, who killed his teacher?
BAILEY I TRULY LOVE ALL YOUR CONTENT. YOU ARE AN AMAZING STORY TELLER, BUT FOR HEAVEN SAKE PLEASE CHANGE YOUR THEME SONG. IT IS TRULY GETTING ANNOYING.
Can you cover the Pedro Rodrigues case? Or “the perfect psychopath”
I don’t think he manipulated her but I do think he had a hand in it. Like you know when you wanna do something with another person and there’s a certain situation where you don’t out right say it, but you both know ? I think that’s what happened. I think he knew but he just kinda 👀 looked away and didn’t say anything cause he wanted that to, idk if you know what I mean.
I'd like you to do the story of Billy Mulligan from 1977. It has everything from multiple personalities etc
Ive been extremly depressed and borderline suicidal lately so i just want to thank you for bringing some sunshine to my life. ❤even if its only 35 minutes.
Hey bailey please can you do a videos on molly young there's alot of people who kneed to know about that happened to her she's very loved and missed
Can you please do true gabby patito case please
Loving the bird noises at the beginning 😂
Jennifer died on my birthday🥰🥰
Please do the shooting of Savannah McNeal at Colorado state university her boyfriend shot her and shot her best friend as well, she was one of my best friends and I would love to heard some details on her death.
I love you so much, you're the best!!!!
Bailey please do a video about Fred and Rose West and the house of horrors they lived in.
What in the desperate housewives is this story!! 😂 they must’ve based some of the show on this fr
Bailey .. I need to ask you for some help girl. I hope you are able to read this. Please send me a message, and I'll tell ya all about it!
The story of iconic drummer Jim Gordon is an interesting and heartbreaking one. Everyone look into it! It would be cool if Bailey did a video on him.
The rikki neeve story we need answers!!!
I don’t feel sorry for Jennifer at all.  Nobody held her hand & shot the gun.  It was her choice.  As for the rotten husband he also deserves life without parole!
Your hair is so cute! Big time fan! Love your vids, vibes, attitude, theme song,  haha and content of course. Muah, I need some merch lol
hi bailey! please do the yuka takaoka.
6 million people like this huh. Ok
PLEASE DO MINNIE DEAN FROM NEW ZEALAND 👀
I would love for you to cover the chandler halderson case from Wisconsin! Would love to hear you tell that crime! Please do it, I watched the trial! Can’t wait to hear what you think…
So sorry about your breakup Bailey.  Sending you so much love!
Hey Bailey. Not sure if this interests you but the Donnelly massacre in Lucan, Ontario, Canada. It’s actually my home town and tons of info on it, thought it would fit in perfectly with you,
Please do Ronnie O’Neil !!!!
Where’s the newest Monday episode?? I’m having withdrawals! 😩
You should do Billy Milligan! Absolutely mind boggling
My hometown has 81 people lololoo
I'm so lame but Bailey is literally my only friend who gets me 😅
This story sounded very familiar to me in which I was answering questions lol , last year I started watching cold cases again and I actually watched this story. 😳 Crazy.  Joe Kenda homicide hunter. I had to Google it. I believe he was one of the detectives on the case. It was cool to watch.
I would love to hear your take on what happened to Johnny Gosh and Eugene Martin!!!
Please please please look up Dr. Norman Larzelere. Great story in my little Florida town
Another one is Amber Agee & unfortunately, it remains unsolved.
Me watching this while eating ramen noodles 😂🥰
It takes about 5 seconds max to recock a revolver
Smells like Compassionate Release. She was getting to expensive to care for in prison.
Your hair 😍
Sis was 28?! You sureee ?! Ma’am 🥴
Hey Bailey,  Can you do Vivienne Cameron and Beth Bernard? One is dead and one is missing.
Your hair looks cute Bailey!
Miss you so much! I hope you’re okay 🖤
You should do a story on Tamara Samsonova, fun fact if you played the scary game “granny” its based on her!
Please do the chicago ripper crew
I think that they came up with it together, I don't think that she was manipulated. I think she got scared when she was caught and blabbed. They probably came up with the whole thing in the hot tub at the gym. That poor woman was just living her life and her dirtbag husband decided that her life wasn't worth anything. I hope she and her family know peace
I’m disappointed tuning in on Mondays and for there to always be a big gap. I’m okay waiting, i just wanna know cause i get excited :(
Can you do the Joe Bryan case?! It’s from my hometown! 2020 covered it- “The principal’s wife” LOVE YOU!
Do one on Kendall Francois!
When you said slapping meats together I lost it bruh 😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂
If I had you as a teacher, I feel like I’d understand things much better. You tell things in a way that is easily learned.
Started watching an episode of homicide hunters and the mentioned the "peacemaker". Thought it was odd but the more I watched the more I realized it was about THIS homicide! Had to come back and make sure and it was!
Bailey. Sweet dove. I’d assume it’s called a peacemaker cause once the person you’re shooting is dead the fight is over 😉😂😂
When is the next M, M, & MU video?? Missing it!
That’s complete bs by the kid got 110 years
Can you do one on The Girl From Plainville , especially since now they are gonna make a show. I love how you always have the actual facts
As soon as I heard Peacemaker I was like, Wyatt Earp’s gun? It’s not to make peace between shots, it’s to make your peace before it takes your life.
I have one for you!!!  Donald Harvey  AKA "Angel of Death." Claimed to have killed 87 people. London, KY.
You should do a video on the book/podcast of frozen tears
Hi Bailey! I love your videos….would you ever do one on Israel Keys sometime?? Just heard about him 🤢
Thanks for explaining what Lupus is. The more awareness the better!
Lol never heard of one of 10 commandments being 'Thou shalt not get a divorce'
bailey could you do the hello kitty case
You should do the hillside strangler Kenneth Bianchi. His story is crazy!
Do you even like doing these anymore?
There's a troll in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series named Detritus and he has a huge cross bow called the peacemaker (piece maker) because people would be in pieces 😅
Imagine Brian watching this now somewhere 😏
Ooooh could you look into doing an episode on Dennis Nielsen
“super charming cute little town” has population around 500’000 Girl I live in the second largest city in my country. The population is around 282’000..... I know it’s all in the context, but still I was like HUH
You’re not back 🥺
Hi Bailey I’ve been a fan for years and I was wondering if you could do one about Carolyn Holloway Donham and Emmet Till I just found out this woman is still alive and hasn’t been held accountable for her actions it would mean a lot if you could speak about it
Where did she go its been 2 weeks now I need my weekly dose 😂😂😭😭
You should do the story of Randy Roth, Its really crazy
Hey lady u and your family r in my prayers during this hard time for yall can't  wait to see you come 2022 wow its hard
My best friend told me to watch this channel and now i can't stop watching  it. I absolutely love ya Bailey. Can u do one on H.H. holmes?
Bailey can you do one on Madam Lalaurie???
Nah girl. Uh uh. Put that make up back on! You scarring me.
Bailey, you should do a video on the death of Lauren Fields. You give us so much insight into these mysterious type of cases and insight is what this case lacking. Alot just doesn't add up .
I saw on one of your social medias that you said you weren’t okay and just wanted to let you know we’re all thinking about you and miss you lots 🥺
Lt. Joe kenda investigated that homicide, it actually came on an episode of homicide hunter with Lt Joe kenda.
Please do Diane Downs! That woman is nuts!
this is prob my favorite makeup look you have done so far! its just enough/simple and you look fabulous!! (not like you dont look fab all the time! u really dont need makeup but u are amazeballs at it!)
Bailey only for you would I let the advertisement play and not hit skip.
Love the Theme song! Love you!🤩 take care
Brian should have gotten a life ins on Jennifer 🤣🤣🤣
What happened last week and this week? No new videos for this list
Could you do a product list by chance?
You should do an episode about Michaela Costanzo!!!
You need 2 Monday's off at the beginning of the year Bailey, really? I guess we are stressing you out way too much.
Your hair is DELIGHTFUL!
Am I tripping or has Bailey not posted in like two weeks? Is she going on another Vacay? YouTube is boring!
Well I mean they both slapped meats so….they should be equally held accountable in my humble opinion….love ya Bailey🥰be seeing you soon💓✌🏼💯
Please do a video on MARCUS WESSON... He Turned His Family Into An Incestuous Cult – Then Marcus Wesson Killed Nine Of The Children.. Had Children With His Own Kids
BAILEY! You forgot the theme song!!  Sana-sa Sana-sa!!!! Xoxo. Glad youre back
they released her because they didn't want to pay her medical bills lol.
Can you do a story on Adrienne Reynolds please!!!!!! It happened in Illinois .
Wow been watching your videos for years and I have lupus cool to have awareness ish by someone I like so much 😁
You have to do the Alison Botha case. Such a horrific story but the comeback and what happens afterwards is amazing !
Why aren't you posting anymore???
Baileys telling of this case reminds of an episode of Drunken History lol "look here kitty cats" 😆
They probably released her so the state didn’t have to pay for her treatment.  Some church leaders are charismatic manipulators. I can see the family being fooled. I 100% think he was responsible.
I love your vids, my mom and I tune in every Monday! Can you please look into the case, Laurie Show?
Roberto Silva jr pls
BAILEY WHERE DID YOU GO?? WE MISS YOU🥺❤️
Thank you
Happy Belated New Year Bailey !! You got me through Covid-19
Where’s the video for this week
Great to have u back
Most guns are semi automatic, so once it engages no need to re-engage. Revolvers must always have the hammer pulled to use.
I've listened to u so much at night while trying to fall asleep that my bf be requesting for me to turn one of ur videos on lol. U have became my bedtime story teller lol
The chance of you seeing this is so so slim! But I love your content and I’ve been binge watching all your episodes. I’m from Australia and one of the most known interesting cases is Ivan Milat. Super super interesting and I would love your take on it. There is a documentary on it which is fantastic too. 🤍
She should do one on the sherry shriner cult and i love her videos. I got my mom, dad, stepdad, uncle, and few friends watching her because I watch her videos all the time lol 😁
Bailey it would mean the world to me if you could cover my friend ANDREA Knables case. It's not getting much attention and she's been missing for awhile now., I can give you her sister Erin's information who can tell you all about the night Andrea went missing and so much more..
“If you are unaware of what lupus is-“ Me, diagnosed with lupus at 16: “Oh, Bailey, honey. I’m very well aware.”  Edit: hearing the husbands reasoning just gives me the urge to send this video to my parents with the saying: “here’s why I’m single.” 🤣
if there were witnesses why did no one try to help
Girl comeback with a new video pleaseeeee💜
Where are the Monday videos 😫😫😫
Typical 1980s/90s fundamentalist Christian blaming the woman for EVERYthing. THAT'S why they all ganged up on Jennifer.
Brian's got some Manson lamps eh
Ergh, she said Lupus and I got triggered because I have the disease and I almost died in 2019 from it
I feel like I haven't really watched a mmm video for awhile. I need to really enjoy this  I have missed you lol
Honestly as an Ex Army Wife who used to live on Fort Carson. This story doesn’t surprise me at all. A lot of weird people live in Colorado Springs
Awesome
Why you not post the last 2 Mondays?
Bailey!! Please please please do the Hay Min Lee case! I HAVE to know your thoughts on it!😩
I know it's not a dark history, but would you please talk about the life of Betty White or Bea Arthur?
You should do a video on the Leopold and Loeb case from 1924. It’s crazy!!!
I agree   No man is worth sinning for.
As a person who's name is Jennifer this episode is very disorienting when your doing other things and heres bailey going Jennifer Jennifer lol
Where r you  bailey haven't seen you in 2 weeks
Bailey I don’t think it’s necessarily in Gods plan. I believe that we incur Karma and we reincarnate over and over until we have learned and became who we chose to be.
Yet the poor kid that had his semi malfunction gets life when POS people like this get less
Thinking of you Bailey 🥺❤
Weird story to hear as my Husband's name is Bryan and my name is Jennifer, he's in the army and has been stationed at Ft. Carson before we met. Exclaimer: no one has died in the making of my marriage 🤣
I love Bailey, but the Peacemaker wasn't THAT difficult to prep for a second shot... If it had a full cylinder, it would be just a matter of pulling the hammer back and firing, which would take seconds. Info from a childhood education in Westerns and a quick Google search to confirm dusty memories.
Where’s Bailey? I’m having withdrawals 😭
Thank you, Bailey, for making me snort water up my nose at "slapping meats together" XD
I guess if I like makeup and true crime im gonna have to find somebody else since we only get a video once a month, sheesh
Is Bailey on hiatus again?
The moment your able to get a puppy finally so guess who your naming it after??? That’s right Bailey!! 😍
So is this the last M,M,& M she's doing? The description says "from start to finish" and it's been weeks since she posted.
What’s up with the smiles in their mugshots??? You ruin your whole life, let alone the lives of children, parents, siblings, this is terrible 😞
This is officially my favorite video of Baily's ❤️
Do the greenbrier ghost case!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Spiritual abuse!
Is this the most recent MMMMonday? I’m so sad rn.
No video for two weeks 🤷🏻‍♀️
There aren't many gun enthusiasts in here so I just want to clear something up lol. Single action revolver doesn't mean slow. You don't have to reload every time you make a shot or spend much time cocking the gun. You pull back a hammer and shoot. It's not like a shot gun where it's a huge gesture.   If her husband was an army man chances are he probably took care of his guns, especially an antique gun that still fires.
What are you using olor eyebrows? It looks like there is wax or something on your wand
Does anyone know when she’s coming back from this BREAK ?!
Bailey where are you…..??
Bailey where are you? I’m sad without you
Can you do The Alyssa Bustamante case; one of the youngest killers??? Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeease :)
I’d love to see your take on a case from my hometown. My dad worked with the victims father. Skylar Neese from Morgantown WV.
Where's Bailey guys??? Two weeks since this "i'm back" video...
Are you quitting Mystery & Makeup? You haven't been consistent with your videos after your hiatus, I was just wondering, we'd sure miss you if you decide to stop, but it's your decision, I'd support you either way.
When is Bailey supposed to come back to Mondays?
Do OJ Simpson
Can you do a video about Anatoly Moskvin
Talk About ali nassar abulaban or Stephen Reitz
For those wondering about a video for MMM- on Twitter Bailey said that her and Fern broke up sadly. :( so I think she is just taking a break to cope with everything. She said she will post a life update soon. Sending lots of love and hugs to her, and I know she’ll be back when she’s ready. ❤️
No video today either?😢 I miss the Monday uploads, it gave me something to look forward to on mondays
Anyone know what's up with Bailey?? She said she'd be back 3 weeks ago but only uploaded this video since? Hope she's ok!
PLEASE DO JONBENET RAMSEY’S CASE!!!
No MMM again this week? 😭😭😭
I seriously effing love you girl!
look up karen bodine
Brian, being the only beneficiary of his wife’s life insurance payout, can enjoy the money & all of their assets, with an alibi at time of crime and perfectly dissociated himself from the scene could never be caught otherwise if he was a bit careful & didn’t meet up with mistress at her work. Boss of flower shop had done right.
Please do a story on Alison Botha!! I am shocked how this is not a more talked about case. Her will to live and fight threw her ordeal is astonishing.
Anybody else waiting anxiously for what we hope will be today’s MMM???
Prisons will release inmates that have serve illnesses early so they don’t have to pay for their medical treatments
Idk if you ever watched it but there is a show called Homicide Hunter with Joe Kenda, he was from Colorado Spring. It’s an awesome show
Bailey!!!! You got to do a story on alison botha!! You’re mind will be blown sis!
I love your channel!!! So shocked to hear a story about my hometown.
Aw ): my heart at the part where she talks about not knowing relationships behind closed doors :/ her and fern broke up days after this
Can we get a link for the clips pleeeease?  🙏🏻
Can you do Christian Andreacchio?
weeeeeel I went ahead and looked him up on facebook. found him.
Can you do the story on Diane and Bob Ward?
“HOW PUT IT UP TO HER!” 😂 you mean put her up to it?? I love you
Jasmine Melendez story please !
can you cover the lauren smithfield’s case? it doesn’t sit right with me and how they aren’t looking into it at all
Do you think Jen was trying to frame Ben? She used his clothes and his gun, left his clothes to be found, and then forced him to take the gun back. Maybe she and Brian didn't expect that Ben's workplace would have proof that he was at work. Framing Ben would mean that both Jen and Brian would no longer have partners that they were tied down to and they would be free to be together.
I’d love you to do a Fred and Rose West episode! 👍
Maybe a MMM about Anatoly Moskvin? Just saw a short video about him and I’m blown away in a creepy and little bit horrified way
Very unlikely that you’ll see this but can you do Anatoly Moskvin please and thank you
Me just pregaming and waiting anxiously for Bailey to drop so new fire seeing as it's Monday!!!  Love all the hard work and respect you show those you do stories on!!  Thanks for being you Bailey!!
Hey Bailey, if you haven’t done an episode on Vanessa Guillen, please do. It is a heartbreaking story that eventually inspired the “I am Vanessa Guillen” Act.
What in the time travel are we doing right now!?! 🤪😂
Why did I sence a death flag when I saw his current photo
FINALLY i missed you
I'm listening to this episode again, here at a rehabilitation center where I'm in physical therapy, when my nurse walks in n says I love Bailey 😂 In every hospital I've been to there is at least one nurse who knows who Bailey is.
Do you normally use a setting spray when done?
Dr. Carl Tanzler is the creepiest and most haunting true crime story I've ever heard. I would love to hear your take on it.  WARNING: It might cause some nightmares, but at least it's solved.
I think they were trying to frame the chicks husband and that way they could end up together. His clothes his gun
….i literally got accepted into ASU and it’s only 45 mins from me
You should do a dark history on the peace maker... 😬 Look into it. Some dark history for sure.
I'm not sure if there's a place to request a case but Mary Vincent is one you should cover! She survived but the story is crazy.
I just want you to know that your videos/podcasts have helped me regain control of my home. If it wasn’t for your stories my house would be a literal disaster. I only allow myself to watch your videos when I’m cleaning and it’s the best motivation to get my home tidy. Thank you Bailey!
I vote to have a video of Bailey Bloopers!!
Gypsy Rose!!
Why do you remind me so much of Cloe From Lucifer??
Your hair is so cuteee !!
Can you do a video  on Pedro Lopez
Can you do Padrino Rodriguez, it says online he killed up to 100 people, most of them were criminals. He now has a YouTube channel and is out of prison.
You should really look into doing the most famous serious killers for each state mine would be delaware Steven Pennell love your videosss❤️
I really wish your stories were dubbed over animation .
my grandma has lupus
I’m from Canada and when I was 4 my dad was actually posted to Colorado Springs.
"What in the time travel??" Lolol I love your personality,  absolutely
She died when she got out because the state was no longer paying for her housing, food, and medical bills….
The cute butterfly clips took me straight back to the 90s ✌️
I would love for you to tell me the story of Christopher Lee Watts.. I love your channel and have been watching for years..
He looks like a psychopath in that Mug shot
“Peace maker-“A gun that will give you time to make peace with the person you want to shoot. Bailey.🤣🤣🤣
Idk where to tell you this at but you should do the case of ronnie O’Neal the third
Have you heard of Stephen Peter Morin? 😬😬 he was a doozy
There was this documentary on hulu, children of the snow. There were a lot of twists and craziness surrounding the events. I think you may enjoy the suspense of all the plot twists.
Have you never watched tombstone?! Wyatt Earp? Doc Holliday? I'll be your huckleberry?!
can you please do Tamla Horsford??
Awesome video
Woman your are still the best!🖤🖤🖤🖤
will you do Mel Ignatow?
New here and I've only gotten to the theme song part but that made my dog go wild. 😂 I already like you.
I need Bailey to cover the Butcher Baker
I love the peace maker. I have one , and it’s in a case. I’d never use it
Love your channel, can you please do a video about “the ant hill kids” cult.
Hey Bailey.  Happy New Year to you and Family
oh so it was the husband
I have a suggestion, how about Leonarda Cianciulli, the soap maker. Nothing to do with having the same name as I do, just suggesting😜
Brian..... Come on in! I'm dyin' over here!!! Love you girl!!
Bailey: “Yeah Jen and Ben”   Me: 😳😳😳
Lol I live in Colorado Springs 😭
Also I’m not sure where to send case suggestions or if you’ll see this but this one I found is absolutely insane. Look into Elisabeth Fritzl. Just absolutely.. wow.
Could you do the Thomas Brown case next??? Canadian Texas. It’s unsolved and his family still wants answers, everyone is still wondering how this isn’t solved yet. It’s a crazy story.
<whispers>  *science*
Could you do Alison Botha? Story sounds unbelievable!!!
I live about an hour away from Colorado Springs shout out! @Baileysarian
Hey Bailey! You should talk about this case call The Puppet Master victim name Aliza Parsy an 18 year old girl in New York. If you haven’t mention it yet  Love yah !
I think they called the gun the peace maker, bc it would  settle any fights &/or disagreements.🤔 The name of the gun can also mean when you're armed with it you have a peace of mind that nobody's going to harm you🤔
ok but is it just me or does old brian look like frank from criminal minds
you should read the story of agatha christie!
They both needed to have the same sentence. Life without patrol. 👍👍
Love the makeup and hair!! 💕
Love your hair sooooo cute.❤️
I have lupus.
Can you do anatoly moskvin!?
do luka magnota!
Hello from Colorado Springs!!
Hey I love your vids and was asking if you could do Alison botha next please
For any other crime show junkies like me, Lieutenant Joe Kenda aka "homicide hunter" on Hulu actually solved this case. (S2E1) it gives even more detail and a different perspective 😊
Bailey you should cover the Martha Moxley case. 😃♥️
... Where did you go Bailey? Are you okay? Your fan's miss you...
I live near Colorado springs and I hate going there because it's one of the larger cities in the area and you never know what could happen
Strange to use, an antique gun.
Are u ever nervous that people u talk about r gonna try & contact u?
I want to hear you talk about "Dead Man's Gultch" Located around Atoka Oklahoma
I dont think she was manipulated. Even if he used Jen to get life insurance money, that doesn't mean that Jen wasn't a willing participant. Her reasoning for doing it doesn't take away from the fact that she wasn't forced to do it.  I think they were both equally guilty and neither one of them were smart enough to pull this off.
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Where did you find the Audrey replica in the background?
Love your videos. I cracked up when you said slapping meats. I’ve never heard the term before.
Can you do Lizzie Borden??! I love your videos and her story is crazy!
Bailey: “It’s always the husband”  Me: Bruh. That’s why I like women  😭💀
"slapping meats together" BAILEY.
I started watching this series a couple of months ago and now I can't get enough! So well done and researched. Have you done a show on Joseph DeAngelo?
I wonder how after watching all her videos (and I watched them many times, believe me), I still can’t do a simple makeup 😄
I’ve been seeing stuff about Gwen shamblin.. if Bailey hasn’t talked about her yet.. hope she does 🙃
1:33 I sure did take a moment to appreciate your cute hair Bailey!!
Hey, Bailey. Are you interested in making a video about your process of finding topics and researching them and chosing what to include and what to omit for the sake of the stories? I sure would like to watch that because I have always been curious about it.
You should do a video on Susan Powell... she went missing in 2009 in Utah. It's super sad.
Please do a story on john norman collins
"What in the time travel...are we in CLUE?" 🤣🤣🤣 Bailey...lol
I think they both deserved Life Sentences
WHERE DID YOU GET THE HAIR CLIPS BABE???
Do we think we can get the Gainesville Ripper in spirit of the new Scream movie release? 😌
You should do the story of Denise Pflum! It’s absolutely heartbreaking how badly the police dropped the ball.
Hie Bailey, can you do Griselda Blanco?  I found her story thrilling and would appreciate it hearing from you😅
Reminds me of a vid about how narcissists would use religion to manipulate people.
I really thought that was Ina Garten lol
Can you do a video on the Peterson family. A man killed his pregnant wife
I love you Bailey Bestie
Definitely look up the "Peacemaker ". If tv shows are to be believed, it was Wyatt Earps gun.
"Slapping meats together" Bailey you're such a romantic. Love ya
Not saying he is innocent but she did have lupus so a life insurance policy isn’t super off the wall
this is definitely not my like 3rd time watching this😳 love you bailey❤️
I love the background
wynona earp fans when peacemaker came on the screen 🤩🥳
happy new years my lovely lady! i hope you enjoyed your time off xox fun food for thought have you tried or seen the makeup trend of matching your brows to your eyeshadow and liner?? think it would be a fun look coming into the new year love you! xox
Hi I am on my mom’s phone and I want your merchandise
I swear the “if you love me you would do this for me” quote is sUuch a red flag 😳😬
The Springs is a cute until you realize how racist some of the residents are
Is videos one a month now
Id love you to make a vid on Randy Stair, its a  relatively new case and i know you can make it very interesting!
So glad you are back.....
Bailey maybe you can do Jaime Osuna
this is better than netflix
Ben. Totally innocent and unaware and left to raise 2 girls, aged 2-4, I believe. Tragic, however, this guy, Brian, had been scouting around for at least 3 years to find the perfect… Jennifer
I served on the grand jury in this case in Colorado Springs. I’m here to say, ironically, a friend from my elementary school testified, and he was suggesting to her…..same. 3 yes earlier
You should cover Lina Medina
I love her so much!!!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❣️
💖💖💖
Has Bailey done a video on how weird and mysterious the Natalie Wood case was????
"Hey Braai" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why did the wats family popped in my head😕
Love the hair clips, looks like a tiara. So cute. Love the hair too.
Could you do an episode on Selena Not Afraid? She was 16 when she went missing under suspicious circumstances in 2020 after a New Years Eve party in Big Horn County, MT. She was found weeks later in the area after searches were called off. Super sad and her family is still searching for answers. I think someone with your influence could help spread her story. You're amazing 💗
I know you probably won’t see this but there’s a story about Francine Hughes. There was a movie made long ago called burning bed, she is my ex stepdads mom and I would absolutely love to see someone do a video about her story.
I cant believe I just found out about her,and ever since am obsessed, shes all I watch now🤣🤣😂.personality on AWESOME!!!
When they went to the same college as you 😳 gross
Would you please consider doing the Susan Smith story
I live in the springs!! Shout out lol
This story is on discovery + on a show called joe kenda homicide hunter. 10/10 recommend this. PS Joe is the detective on this case.
My mom used to go to a lupus support group when I was a kid😩 sometimes she’d take me w her, the people there were SO nice&taught me tons of things 💙
I think his sentence should've been longer.  There is something religious leaders have...don't know what it is because it didn't work on me.  But they have something that enables them to control/manipulate people really easily.  What a shame.
Bailey can you please do Robert Hansen - AKA The Butcher Baker? My ex husband did time with him in prison in Alaska!
Jennifer sounds like a real winner as well
Hmm..Was it her husband?
Listening on Spotify now! Still coming back to see the beautiful makeup.  Suggestion for the next one; Carr Brothers or BTK from Wichita, KS.
Video suggestion: Josh Powell
Can you do Alison Botha’s story?
Saw this story on the ID discovery channel.
Dang girl you're gorgeous.
Bonnie and Clyde
DO THE MITCHELLE BLAIR STORY!!!
Karma. It was karma. Just my opinion though.
This is why I run, Bailey. If nothing else I will out run an attacker.
I'd like to see you do a video about Alison Botha I just seen a quick video on tiktok about her and it's a wild story.
I Wonder if she did a Jack the ripper story?
Slapp’n meats.
Can you do the Kenneka Jenkins story?
Bailey I live in Colorado and I will say don’t waste your time visiting Colorado Springs haha
The extra note on the theme song made me laugh for the first time today 😂 perhaps I'm easily pleased but thank you Bailey 🖤
Your beautiful  I love goth rock women
Slapping meats 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I missed you so much !😩
You should do a story on Alison Botha
What happened to the kids?
There are numerous reproductions of Colt 1873’s made
I just wanna say that Colorado Springs is not a little town, or have a lot of church relations haha. But it’s beautiful here!
Ahhhh I live for these videos! But I came across a topic that might be interesting! The Wesson Family Massacre. I cant remember if you've done this one already. But this is hands down one of the most horrific things I've read about! Please NEVER stop making these videos! Love love love love love loveeee
Because it was the “equalizer”.  It let a small man or a woman stand on equal terms with a bandit or ruffian.  Adverts of the era focused on this.  Be not afraid of any man  No matter what his size  If danger threatens, call on me  And I will equalize.  Both women and men understood the truth behind this advert, and bought Colt handguns.  Peace tends to flow from physical Equality.  Demonstrating that Equality by use of a gun was more likely to generate Peace than submission to rapine…
PLEEEEASEE BAILEYYY please please DO BETTY BRODERICK !!!! now that the Netflix series is also out i really need to see it from you and actually learn the whole story!!
“when they got done slapping meats”  this is amazing.
Exactly why my man ain’t going to the gym alone 🤣
Lol how ironic! we are literally about to pcs to Colorado Springs 👁👄👁
There’s different laws governing the gifting of antique firearms. Restrictions aren’t as stringent, easier to give.
William Cody Neal (Colorado)
This has always been at the back of my mind but just realised- the way Baily speaks before applying lipstick and after applying lipstick, absolutely hits different!
I can’t with her today!!! The time traveler comment with the Clue innuendo had me dead!! I was just on a family vacation and we played Clue Jr and her comment had me. Can’t stop laughing, thank you!
Bailey you should do Richard Speck next.......love you 💙
loved this one!!! the PeaceMaker was actually an important part of your history. (im australian) WYATT EARP his pistol was the peace maker !!!
Hello bailey 👋, i don’t know if you did this but can you do Jack the Ripper?
The way she used her husband's clothes and gun seems she was hoping her husband would get the blame and not her
There's this tiny part of my little black heart that springs to life at the sound of Bailey's theme song...is this what joy feels like? :D
You should do the Peter lundin case! Its both danish and english case❤️
i love ruthless bailey so much!
I haven't ever seen this one on your page and I would really like to hear one about Muskegon Michigan where I live and the girl that died and I know he killed more but her name was Jessica herring
Bailey if ever you get the travel bug and come to Kenya......which am like lowkey wishing you will......please visit Nairobi....l will be here fangirling on you...l just love you
Have you done one on Fritz Honka yet?
I just had a thought, have you ever considered doing a mmm on the dr harold shipman? He was a dr in the UK who killed several hundred(reportedly) people
Can you please tell the story about Alison Botha
Please do JinnKid (Ali Nassar Abulaban) TikTok star who killed his wife!!!
“Look you little kitty cats”
Can you do a deadly women month? I’ve watched them on the discovery channel but I think you could do so much better.
Bailey, you're a very entertaining storyteller.
If you haven't already, I'd really like to see your take on the Eileen Wurnos story.
People are horrible
Please do Alison Botha she’s amazing !!
Your gloss is trixie mattel thata cool I'm a big fan
Girl I want to see you talk about the Turpin family
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Colorado springs is bigger than Denver now its not a small town anymore
Bailey I’d like to recommend a case here in Wisconsin. It’s my own family. CHANDLER HALDERSON. 23 years old. Killed his mom and dad. Chopped off their heads and burned them in the fireplace in the living room. Cut off their legs arms and torsos separately and hid them all over Wisconsin.  He’s was found guilty today on all 8 charges   This all happened because he lied and said he was going to school, working everyday.  It it was all a lie and his parents found out!
22:56 was so funny to me 😹😹
I catch myself randomly humming the intro song constantly 😂
Check out Tyler Hadley in Port St. Lucie,FL for a story. Very creepy!
250k is small town? My town has 12k and it's getting too big for me.
The flower shop hmm
Can you do the Menéndez brothers next??
Please do an episode about Vera Renczi.
Did you get this story from Joe Kenda, Homicide hunter? 😆 love that show
i kinda cried when she said colorado springs
Dean Corll would be a great video!
I just the heard story about christine Belford, in Delaware, it's a crazy story!!!
Jennifer used her husbands gun and uniform, they were gonna pin it on him to get rid of him
Joe kenda was on this case 😍
both are smiling in their mugshots...
I missed you!!!!
Definitely not a small town anymore lol
Does someone know why she didnt upload last monday?
can you please do a video about the north Hollywood shooting that happened in the 90s, a friend told me about it and its such an interesting story
Could you maybe talk about Shawn grate? It’s a disgusting case..
Can you cover Ronnie O’Neil’s crimes???
Can you do an episode on Ronnie O’Neal!!!
Cover Luca magnotta
Bailey please investigate Jessie Morrison from greeneville, tn. From what I know of this case it’s full of twists and turns
Do Ronnie O’Neal
I love the irony of those revolvers being called Peacemakers... So much so that I got a big tattoo of one on my arm... But shooting flowers 😏🕺🌹
Please tell us about H H Holmes!
Can you please do the story of Allison Botha because that lady is a real life super woman and deserves her story to be told. She’s an inspiration to all. You would tell her story so well
Girlll ...did you take some speed 😂🤷?!
Have you ever done a video on Nevada-tan? I just saw another video about this 11 year old girl from Japan back in 2004. Kind of interesting actually and extremely weird. If you're looking for a new case to research and do a video on, I'd love to see you do a video on this one. :)
Joe Kenda's whole show was focused on his time as a detective in Co Springs. I've been there a few times. Very pretty area.
I’ve missed u so much Bailey😭😭💞💞💞💞💞💞
Can you please do a video on Billy Milligan?
Sooo it kinda *was* the husband??
i’ve lived in colorado springs for years and i had no idea about this-
Every time you say Jennifer, I feel like I’m in trouble...
“JeNnIfeR! “ Or should we say Jody 🤪
Slappin meats 💀 oh my 😂😂
Please cover David Bocks! Such a interesting but tragic situation.
Need to get back on form with your Monday videos
I don't care if she was coherced or did it on her own, she's been proved to be a danger to society. People like this need to be locked up for our own safety, we deserve that much.
"Babe, Babe, I wanna gun😌" 🤣🤣😂😂only Bailey man
Brian's smirking all over all the photos, these sorts shouldn't be able to procreate=(
Is that an engagement ring?!?
Ahhhh your hair is so amazing in this vid!!!  But yeah, whether or not she was "manipulated" by Brian, Jennifer literally killed someone so she deserved the sentence she got. Brian should've gotten more time too though, I think.
please do dorothea puente !!
Love ya girl suggest doing Richard Speck , H.H. Holmes , Or Doctor Death Harold Shipman
I’ve been watching Bailey for YEARS and have never and will never understand how she keeps her piercing so clean when applying foundation 😂😂😂
You should do Shawn grate next!
Shoot I was stationed at fort Carson before and I didn’t know that there was so much crime connected with the springs area.
Brian and Jennifer are probably why "dumb and inlove" is popularized
When ya gonna change ya background lol
colorado springs viewer here, hearing my town described as small is so weird
They both needed to be away for life honestly
Why be with someone you don’t want to be with in the first place.
Bailey!!! I’d absolutely love to see you do an episode on the Ronnie O’Neal case, it’s absolutely gut wrenching.
You’ve gone again 😢😢😢
Soon as this started knew it would be lt Joe kenda that was the lead on this. Anyway want to see the episode that is this case its.. Homicide hunter season 2 episode 1 I now pronounce you dead
Love this girl
The state probably didn't want the responsibility of dealing with a Cancer convict, so they cut her loose after the time she spent in prison. As far as Brian goes, oh yeah... he was definitely guilty. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that they both were greedy, younger and extremely self-centered. He probably changed his name. They both deserved life. "It takes two"... yanno?
Hi, I would like to suggest you look up the 1999 Valentines Day triple slaying in Cleveland, Tn. Would like to see you do a video on it. I love your videos. I could sit and watch them all day.
Happy New Year, Bailey! I feel about it being great.... the same.  Lol!
You should talk about Selena Quintanilla like in full detail everyone knows what happened but not in deep detail! :)
Me being from Colorado springs and watching this 👀🤣 thank you!!! I love your vids as always!! ❤🖤
Can you do one from Australia please 🙏
Slapping meats 🥩 together 🤣🤣🤣 🤚🏻
Joseph Edward Duncan lll
Not EXcape, EScape.
The peace sign is the other way round.  You showed us the opposite of peace.
Please look into the Dorothea Puente case🙏🏼💗
Your ability to do makeup and tell the coherent story baffles me! Impressive, glad it’s not voice over.
Btw never fail in making me laugh. In these times that is priceless. ❤
I think Brian was more involved than Jen and Jen made the CHOICE to go along with it
Hey Bailey, can you please, PLEASE do a video on Todd Kohlhepp?!?!
Do Andres Breveik!
Bailey, Would you do an episode on Morgan Nick ?!  A docuseries was just released in May 2021 over the missing 6 year old, the family still has hopes she will be found.
Have you done a video on Angela Simpson yet? Or Lonnie Franklin Jr
Just for the record it literally doesn't take that long to pull a hammer back on a gun....
Watching Baileys followers grow "theme song" you go girl
Bianca devins?? Can this be talked about. I do not know anything about this case!
I’m not sure how many other times I can write this. PLEASE DO MADELINE MCCANN
Such a smart woman and beautiful to boot
That’s crazy. Because I have lupus
I think you're awesome! Please use eyelashes that don't use real animal fur such as mink.
FYI....  so jealous of your hair.  It's FABULOUS!  Meow.
this case was so boring bailey 😩
You do dark history. Look up the peacemaker.   The colt single action army helped win the west. Along with the 1873 Winchester repeater, which is dubbed "The gun that won the west." Which should tell you quite a bit about their history. The same one that caused a woman to build an insane house due vengeful spirits. Both of those guns have a blood-soaked history.  What they were involved in, definitely qualifies as dark history.
We just found out my mom has lupus she sees a doc on the 24th for treatment planning and things
Diane's family just didn't want to raise her kids. That's why the defended him.
You're so pretty.
You said you read comments and I’m not sure how else to ask… but next time you do a missing persons video would you keep in mind the name “Kyron Horman”? He was a child that went missing up in Oregon my aunt has followed his story for years. I think he’s been missing for 10+ years they thought they found him in a different country but it was never confirmed they said it maybe it was photo shopped. However there’s a lot of really suspicious things going on in that case. Kinda reminds me of Casey Anthony
Case on kathleen peterson on Netflix documentary called The staircase please!
Hey beautiful! Do you think you could do a video about the sallie house????
Do what you will with this info but if you are suffering from lupus, check your spleen for parasites.
You should make a video about the case of Junko Frutua (I think that’s how you spell it) the whole thing is crazy. What’s worse is the end of the case, she never got the justice she deserved.
I literally love hearing you talk. You are one of my fav true crimers! Also, you just seem like the nicest person 😭 when Covid is done you should do a meet and greet!
lots of crime in springs now
👏👏👏 You rock for explaining what Lupus is 😇❤
I’ve been looking for your YouTube FOR MONTHS NOW N I FINALLY FOUND YOUUUUUUU 🥴😌😁😁😁 Ilove your stories … oh n your theme song is very original lol
do Sarah and Jaime Melgar next!!!!! Please!!!!
i just ordered some of your suspicious eyes merch and i’m so excited to get it!!! thanks for the great content❤️
Lemme think…………no
Hey My mom loves  your videos……..
Wen Did you start likeing  makeup?  and why Do you Do. Dark history???
She rocks!
I love Bailey! ❤️  I’ve been so excited to catch up on the new MMM Monday and then she starts talking about Colorado Springs, where I currently live. 😮  Also I came from a very small town (population 7,000 people), so when she refers to the former population of Colorado Springs in the 90’s (250,000) as a small town it felt so strange to me.   I had not heard of this story before. I love that she finds mysteries that aren’t always widely known or talked about.
GIRL DID NESTLE COME FOR YOU? BLINK 3X if you need help😩
Do you ever get scared that one of these people is going to get out and watch this video and like try to hurt you I would be worried I’m so anxious lol
*"slapping meats together"* 😂😭
I MISSED U 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 hope your breaks are always refreshing! much love
I did it !! I've watched all of your mm&m videos. And I have to say: You have a great personality and I thank you for all the research you've put into this ! Also I would like to see you cover the Kurt Cobain muder conspiracy. I'm 99.44 sure that CL killed him. But don't read anything by Charles Cross. He believes EVERYTHING CL feeds him. Also I'd like to see you cover the Avery/Dassey case in Wisconsin.  THANK YOU !!
cue drizzy drake
That is now why it's called the peacemaker. History books need to make corrections.
Oh Gurrrlll!! I took a youtube break to catch up on some books I was putting off...oh how I've missed you telling me this craziness!!
I think they both should’ve gotten life.
Anyone know why there wasn't a new video Monday??  🥺🥺
slappin' meats.... BWAHAHAHAHA
Do billy Milligan next
Can you do a story about Anatoly Moskvin? I love your videos ☺️
In February you should do a episode on Emmett till for black history month.
The fact that he pulled out the life ins is super sus
Could you do a video about the disappearance of Christopher Abeyta, another Colorado Springs case? He was abducted as a baby with his parents sleeping in the same room. His siblings are still on the hunt for the abductor and have a Facebook page with their own theories and asking for assistance from the public. There was even a story a few years ago about a man who came forward believing he was Christopher, but sadly nothing came of it.
I like true crime and makeup too girl so of course I had to subscribe.
Do Jack the Ripper !!! ❤️🔥
Loving the butterfly hair  clips?
What's the best way to send you ideas for these videos, Bailey? Amazing vid as usual, missed you and welcome back! 🙌 (Thank goodness for Dark History) 🤣
“Gasperella” is my new favorite word
PeaceMaker, weapon of choice for Wyatt Earp, or Dean Winchester. So he thought she was a demon…  I’m still listening, so kinda teasing, don’t attack me, lol
Cocking a revolver isn’t that slow Bailey my love 😂 it’s literally just pulling the hammer back. It’s rather quick.
Ima need a tutorial on that hair
So just a few cases I've heard about that I thought you might want to cover. Also I love Dark History ❤️ Carly Ryan UK James Fairweather UK Lonzie Barton Jax FL Maddie Clifton Jax FL Star Hobson Michelle & Martin McNeil/ Gypsy Willis  Candy Rogers
I 100% believe they were trying to frame Ben by using his gun and clothes. And they were hoping he’d go to prison for it and that would “get rid” of him.
Please tell the story of Alison Botha!! INCREDIBLE!!!!
Yeah yeah born and raised in Colorado. I lived in Colorado springs a couple years after this happened as a child
When did he take the life insurance policy out? Having a policy on your family members is a smart thing to do, especially if you have children ( helps pay for the childcare you'll need, and house etc)... but if he took it out after the affair started... yeah that says a lot.
where is he now?? "Brian come on in" was my favourite
I love your hair! Looks so healthy!
“and police are like.. yay” .. i adore your reactions sm 12:02
Hi Bailey.  I love your videos.  I have been an avid true crime watcher for many many years.  I'm 57 years old now and when I was very young there used to be true crime magazines.  Several in fact.  I read them all.  But I digress.  I love listening to your stories, many of which I had not heard before.  But I also love watching you put on makeup.  It's strange, but at my age I never learned to do it.  And since I'm getting older I'm looking for ways to hide the age. Lol. So thank you for your uploads.  Keep being you.  And I hope that you've become more relaxed about taping. I know you were very nervous about it at the beginning.
As soon as she said Colorado Springs I said Oh my, my , my! And sure enough, this case was handled by none other than Homicide Hunter, lieutenant Joe Kenda!
I really would love for you to cover the story of Victoria Martins here in New Mexico. It's an incredibly sad story that happened only a few years ago and justice was NOT served to a poor child. Not enough people know about this case. Casey Anthony was blasted for what she did. Victoria Martins was so much worse. I feel very strongly that it needs to be put out there. Please look into it if you can!
Beautiful Bailey! Have you heard of the Steve Avery case?😍
Does anyone know when the new video is coming ? Where are you Bailey?
When you said about the peacemaker, it reminded me of a Jim Jefferies comedy sketch talking about how 'we should all have muskets!' Very funny. Love your videos too :)
CUTE no makeup look!
Do Courtney Taylor of Williamsburg KY. She was a nurse that killed her whole family.
Nannie Doss sounds like an interesting story for a future video
I’d be really interested for you to do a story on Eric Rudolph at some point.
Have you already done a video on Pedro Lopez? He killed like 300 people!
Ya should never do open mouth invisible mic bailey it's not the one
Herman Webster Mudgett aka H.H. Holmes. Apparently he killed a lot of people in Chicago in the late 1800's when they were in the process of building the World Fair.
she should do the story of Peter Niers she always does a great job she would with his story to...
Put it up to her...😂😂😂 It WAS the husband Bailey! I knew it!
Lol your comment "what are we in clue"? 😂😂😂
Is there no Monday mystery , are we again skipping  ? 🥺😭😭😭 I wouldn’t mind if you would skip dark history lol 😂 as it’s only American awful history .
Bailey, you truly do touch so many fans with your videos. I play an online game, and I came across a player named after our favourite undetectable poison - "Aqua Tofana." We shared a moment of appreciation for your content, and it just makes me happy to come across your fans in the wild. :)
Welcome back Bailey!!!!!! Happy New Year 😘😘😘
Yeah, well Brian's a manipulative self absorbed loser...but what is the woman who falls for "we must be ONE" tag line? Not a confident winner in my book.  By the by, it's called double action, the Peacemaker, ya know.
Love that ‘not a gun you can just walk into a Walmart a pick up’  everyone in Australia is like 😳
I’d say peacemaker means shoot the culprit and then you have peace ✌️
Bailey is my best friend in my head!
Bailey why is “Bob Hickman” advertising his cult on your videos that’s so creepy
Bailey admitting she filmed this before her break, “I hope 2022 treats us right”… Betty White.
Netflix and no chill, in God’s eyes.
Wow. My hometown made Bailey's list. Crazy lol
I can't stop laughing about the way you say "Jennifer" over and over.😂
Slappin meats.
It's hard 2 listen 2 the story sometimes cuz Bailey looks like a freakin GODDESS!!!!!!!💕
I'm thinking it was the mistress.
this is the first time im early to one of your videos
BAILEY’S BACK, ONCE AGAIN. BAILEYS BACK,  TELL A FRIEND. BAILEYS BACK, BAILEYS BACK,  BAILEYS BACKKKK DURRDURRDuh
23:00
" Slapping meats together" I love bailey xD
I would LOVE an episode on Bob Berdella.
Why did Brian look so happy in that mugshot!  And wasn’t Jennifer smiling too?
OK, so my name is Jennifer and I use to "Hate" my name ... but after listening to Bailey say "Jennifer" 100x's I've grown to love my name lol 😁 Thanks Bailey you really are the best!
Hi Bailey!
Got all excited because I live in Colorado Springs now. It is beautiful but getting very busy. A lot of people are moving here. We will soon be bigger than Denver.
I definitely think he should have gotten life in prison also.
Can you do the Shawn hornbeck and Ben ombe story?
Can you please do David scott elmquist story I learned about his story on Instagram it’s a very messed up case and the family is trying to get a petition signed to have an unbiased prosecutor to review case
Please H. H. Holmes
Can you do a story on the Gainesville Ripper!! Its actually what the Scream movie franchise is based off of!
my mom graduated from ASU and yea idk just thought that was cool😭😭 ly bailey!!!💖💖
hey bailey!! i'm just waiting for your new vid for Monday and just wanted to tell you that my bday and my mums is Feb 21 (monday) and im rly exiced to see what you post that Monday! :DDDDD see yaaa
God's plan that's crazy
Sounds like Brian a master manipulator. He had everyone fooled with that church persona .
Have you thought about doing an episode on the Yorkshire Ripper? Just watched a series on Netflix about him and the amount of tomfoolery from the police is just… infuriating. I think you’d enjoy the case and be mad about it at the same time
The peace maker is not a slow gun. It's not a doubt action gun. But it easy to pull the hammer back. You can unload the gun under 5 seconds
I was watching with my husband who is a huge gun aficionado and he was explaining to me how difficult it is to even load the Peacemaker. Hearing that, it made me think Ben gave that gun to Jennifer specifically because it would be so challenging to use. Also, fun fact, if the Peacemaker is loaded incorrectly, dropped or even jostled too hard, it will fire because of the way the pin is designed. So, extra dangerous to use!
Brian sounds like the type of guy who was privileged all his life and doesn’t think anything is going to happen to him.
bailey you are the only youtuber i watch that i can truly say ive been watching since you were at 300k
Does anyone know why she didn’t upload this week? Is she okay?
I’m. It’s a contraction. Im is not a word.
Hey gorgeous Bailey! You should do a video about H.H Homes thx
He took out the life insurance policy right before her death. He's guilty. Also why is everyone smiling in their mug shot? LOL.
those smiles in the mugshot was creepy af
I live in Colorado springs and I love it
You should do a video on Jerry Brudos
Can you do Jean Benet Ramsey??
The life insurance definitely needs to be investigated further! How could they ignore that??!
you should do one for Carol Baskin :D
Did she not post yesterday?
😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤
You are one of my favorites! Have you done, "The Servant Girl Annihilator".  I would love to hear you tell the story.
i have rewatched so many of her videos at this point… she’s my favorite part of my day. love getting ready with her ❤️
That ‘Brian come on in’… I would PAY FOR THAT TYPE OF VIDEO ENDING
Slapping meats.. that killed me for a second..
6MILLION!! Congratulations!! 💗
Bailey you should do a Q&A
BRUH this is literally my town, I was born here that year. The evangelical fundies here are a PROBLEM.
I love bailey but like why is she telling the story like this? 🤣🤣 its driving me crazy i cant follow it
My mom was pregnant with me, my brother was a few months old and my sister was nine. A mugger ran up to us and grabbed her purse. She held on for dear life and screamed at him. Luckily this scared him enough to run away
“What in the time travel is going on right now” 😂
Me feeling so uncomfortable every time she says Jennifer because it’s my name. Lol
Where’s Bailey this week
Hi Bailey! So glad you’re back!!! can you talk about the anthill kids gang? Pleeeeease?
Grace Millane!!! So sad 😞
The thing that is the worst about crimes like this is the kids they not only lose their mom but their dad also!!!
Have you looked into The Innocent Man? I would love to hear you talk about it!
Lori Vallow Daybell case for the next time!!!!! Or maybe in march after her next trial. I am socurious about your opinion and findings about this case, Bailey!
Love your content Bailey!! Have you ever done anything for the Anthony Pignataro case?
Tamla Horsford look into it pretty please 🙏🏽
DO STEPHEN PETER MORIN!!!!
Do an episode on kat mcdonough and seth mazzaglia! I want to know more about that case but the info seems to be really scattered.
Bailey I have one thing to say!!! You better work... Your make came out so on point 🙂
“I take great pride in my background…” /existential crisis/ “… HI! ✨” Reasons I think we’d be besties irl 🤣
Lori Heimer, Assaria, KS. Right outside my hometown. Still unsolved. Pleeeeaaase!!?
You're hilarious! And totally remind me of Jessie J.
You are very nice girl 🔝🔝🔝
If you’re looking for stories to cover here is one from Norway where he killed 77 ppl. I read about it while on bed rest during my pregnancy 5 years ago and I just saw he’s trying to get released   - Anders Breivik
Where did you get the plant from little shop of horrors?! Audrey II Is it's name lol. I love that movie so much! You probably got it from Amazon,  I should just look.
What in the time travel is going on what are we in clue? 🤣🤣 I love you bailey
Slapping meats 😂😂 spat my coffee out at that One
Anyone know why Bailey didn't post this past Monday (1-18-22)?? I waited ALL DAY yesterday, and no post came!! I was super sad! I know she takes breaks one Monday a month, but after her long break, I thought for sure her break wouldn't be this soon! But if she needs a break, take it girlfriend!! I just didn't know what happened! Ok, rant over. I was just sad I didn't have my Bailey MM&M!! Hope to see a video soon!! 💙
They were totally in on it together & got off easy
colorado springs is a big ol city bailey but yea its awesome, you should totally go! also why you are there check out morrison, that is a cute little town! CO native here
No offence, I absolutely love you but you making faces and laughing takes away the compassion and empathy for the victims from your videos.
There's a story you should do that happened  where I live. Its literally crazy.
I think, even though it's dramatic with lots of infliction, your voice is soothing.  I just fell asleep listening & well have to redo this one.  It's OK though, I love listening to you.  Wink 😉
It's one week later and you haven't posted something new?.? I'm dying here.
Peacemaker..... I.e.  if we're fighting.... And I pull this joint out.... Afterwards there will be peace cuz it takes two to argue....peacemaker
"I'm never prepared. I'm never prepared...I'm never..." I felt that deeply! 🤣
Pointing a gun at her! Dunna dunnnn😜
It was all the husband idea , he should of gotten the equal amount as Jennifer.
They both looked way too happy in a couple of those mug shots - creepy
Your smile is so contagious, it makes me smile:)
I must know, was Joe Kenda a detective in Co. Springs at that time?
Wow! You mentioned Angelo State University! I live in San Angelo and both went to school there and worked there. I’m shocked because no one has ever heard of us, but Bailey has!!
"Why do you guys gotta keep bringing me into this stuff?  I got miracles to do" 🤣
when is the next video
I love your stories about rich people incests like Barbara Backeland or Candy Mossler it’s hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 “why pay for heating when we could go someplace warm” *laughing with evil rich peoples laugh* “peasants” 😂😂😂❤️
Slapping meats
anyone knows why bailey didn't post yesterday ??
Can I just say I appreciate your shorter nails 💅
You should look up the case of Cynthia Cdebaca
THE VOICE IMPRESSIONS TAKE ME OUT EVERY TIME.
slapping meats!!!  I was dying!!!
I think that’s exactly why they call it the pace maker! 🤔
Look up Michael Swango!!!!!!!!!
I've never seen a smiling mugshot... fennufer grinning!
I’m from Colorado, and I remember this. It was a big story!! It was like the only news for weeks. Bailey, my week is much better after watching you!
where's the 17th?
I love you and your personality, always look forward to the videos bestie 🖤‼️
Both guilty.. Done.
I have a feeling if I lived close to you we would be friends. I love your videos and so happy your back, I hope you had fun with your time off, I know you needed ir but I missed you. As always great video and such a pretty look. Like you need make-up, you can just talk about the muders and I will still watch, Thank you for doing the videos and being here.
It was called a peacemaker because it was used in the army. No more enemies (dead) = peace. I prefer your reason tho😶
Peacmaker makes me think of Wynonna Earp I loved that series lol
I love you, Bailey! 🥰
90s vibing with the butterfly clips, I loved them when I was a kid
Where is todays video? Are you okay???
Hey! Iv never commented before because of the fact i had a relationship with this person. His name is jesse dobbs, from baytown tx. He (unalived) 3 women. A mom and 2 daughters. Id love for you to bring light to this. It happened in 2016. I love you baily!
I know both of them did it...
I heard the peace maker in wynonna earp series hehehehe
My biggest question ⁉️ would be . Why the make up ?  And why do you feel like you need it to feel pretty . Look I'm not hitting on ya or nothing . But your pretty you don't need make up.  Don't know I know a lot of pretty women that feel they need make up  With a flawless face . Anyways great story as I was on the John. No need to try to give yourself  A mind projection on that .
Yes. Sad story,but I lovd the commentary.
Did you know that the US is one of the only Western countries where it's illegal to escape from prison? In other countries they acknowledge that it's normal to want to escape prison and they aren't punished for it.
Your sarcasm and positivity helps me make it through the day. My coworker and I love you so much.
Brian is a very big manipulator that even the victim's own family defended him. He is so scary. This story really tells you, and he's a salesman too. *no offense*
“Slappin meats together”
Me with my Nutella and banana toast mouth full “I wuv woo wailey”.  Shena shAAAAA
Have you talked about " Something is wrong with Aunt Diane"? I went to school with her husband. Curious if you uncover anything new.
"I'm a bit of a liar but... whateva🤪", let's all strive to give off her energy
Woo lawd, I was born in 1990. It's crazy to know about this stuff that happened while I was minding my own business as a kid.
I can’t be the only person who thinks her theme song sounds like “son of Sam, son of Sam, son of Sam Sam son of Saaaaammm” ??
I first thought it was the husband, but when you said the shooter was 5' 6" l said to myself yep, gotta be the husband's girlfriend.. New here, just found your site tonight... and subscribed! 👍 ... l find you have such a great sense of humour... plus the expression s on your face when you're telling a story .. make me lol .....  😊
Can you talk about the gypsy rose case?? If you haven’t already 😬
Morning coffee with bailey is the best !! Especially before the rest of the family is up , its perfecto :)
Happy new year BAILEY😊. Change whatever you want but DON'T EVEN CHANGE YOUR THEME SONG 🤣🤣♥️♥️♥️🇧🇸
"She can't deny she's a total slop!"😂😂😂😂
I love your storytelling, you are funny but well versed on your on you subject, it's clear that much research goes into every story.
DO SAMUAL LITTLE Please he killed 93 people
Nooooo I needed a video today
I Love this look so much, you always remind me of a Bratz doll 😍
I love these!!!! Have you ever done a story on Bell Gunnies? Or Juana Barraza?
As a Jennifer, I felt some type of way when she said “Jennifer”, Jennifer, jEnNiFeR” 😂😂😂 got nervous for no reason 👹👹
Please do a video on Elisa Lam. It’s so mysterious
Will you talk Christopher Duntsch "Dr. Death"? Please and thank you 😊
Hope you're ok Bailey maybe I missed something but I came to catch up on my daily dose of crazy and you haven't uploaded for today. 😅 Take care sweetheart.
I was listening to this and thought it sounded familiar. Went back on Hulu to look Homicide Hunter Season 2 Episode 4 the detective who was on the case actually tells about it. I love that she did this story ❤️
Lol I hope u don't take offence to this but u kinda look like the access that played lunette the clown on big comfy couch xD I always thought she was pretty
This was uploaded on my bday and I didn’t even notice😭thank you Bailey💕💕💕
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
Bailey! I missed you & your videos so much! I have a 2 hour lunch break & most people leave the building. I watch a video every time I go on break & it makes me feel less lonely lbs Thank you for doing what you do!
Brian is such a king Henry 🤮👀
Can you do James Bulger case?
does anyone else clap for bailey when she's done with her theme song?
I went to college in Colorado Springs! Not I go to another college just south of Colorado Springs.
Go into Walmart lol I am in Canada I couldn't imagine Walmart selling guns lol
Do the black dahlia!!!
I love you 😍 missed your videos
Just watched some videos on Josef fritzl 😳🤯 would be interesting to hear Bailey’s version ❤️🥰
Could you do a video about Jones town???
"It's the husband, it's brian🙄 he did it🙄." I love this personality😂 your videos are incredible.
That is totally why it’s called the peacemaker! I don’t care what anyone says! It’s just too perfect to be any other reason..
bailey I would love for you to do the mendez brothers
This is one of my fav makeup looks. Bailey, you’re fantastic! 👏🏼 👏🏼
First of all, I love your impression of G0d--pretty sure that G0d does talk that way, and I'll think that forever now. Second of all, your hair and makeup look is beautiful!
It's actually fairly common that the state will commute a prisoner's sentence when they have terminal illness. The state and taxpayers have to pay for that treatment, and so they will release prisoners to avoid paying the full cost of their treatments.
I L♥️VE Bailey 🐱🥁👻 She’s such a goddess & her personality is the freaking cutest ever & gets me outta my head when I’m feeling down.. 🌙 ❤️‍🩹 We love you, Bailey!! 📖🪜📚🧳🌃👠📰🦇👑 🗞💄 ⛓ 🏋🏼‍♀️🥇🩰🎺📇💌🪄🚪⚰️⚔️🪦⛓
Have you done a story on H H Holmes?? Definitely should! Love your channel ❤️
Love that YouTube allows curse words lol I used to watch you on Facebook,  but deleted it.. anyway , apparently no words are allowed on fb
Is it skip week already ?
Bailey can you please cover the Melissa Lucio case??
Yes your hair looks adorbs in this video
I think Jennifer may have manipulated Brian. She was already going to divorce Ben, and Dianne was getting in her way of being with Brian. She may have plotted with Brian and either made up the excuse about sins or caused him to come up with it himself to justify the action. Idk anything for sure but I think it’s an interesting theory.
Both were equally guilty and it shows the weakness in the system that they were released
hey so we’re waiting for a new video hurry up middle aged woman
Thanks for making me feel better Bailey. Feel pretty bad lately but I’m glad your back and hope you enjoyed your break. I love your look.
Dude! Your channel has blown up! So happy for you! I remember when you hit 1 million.
No video today?😥
Have you heard of the gruesome death of Maria Nemeth? In sunrise, FL. It was pretty Savage
Bailey we would luv for you to come to Colo!!!!
Can you do Bonnie and Clyde next 🥺
“Can you believe it 🦅”
Why didn’t anyone try to help her out????
You should do a video on JonBenét Patricia Ramsey!
Your more than welcome to come visit. We have 5 bases, 1 army base, 3 Air Force bases, and 1 joint base.  We would love to have you here.
Could you plz plz plz do a triple M about Corbin??? The TikTok craze lip sync where everyone got shot but Corbin was found in a garbage can. Little bit of the backstory is Corbin left one day in 2018 to go fill out job applications and never came back. They found his remains about a year later in a garbage can. His family is extremely distraught and upset over this song and the insensitive TickTocker‘s who keep lip-synching to the song!! Please bring this to light for his family.
Please please do a video on Oscar Pistorius 🙏🏻 ☺
Slapping meats 😂😂
If you don't sing along to the theme song... are you even a true fan lol. jk but seriously I can't resist. Love you Bailey!!
It sounds to me that bc she used her husbands clothes and gun she was going to try and frame him but didn’t think about his alibi
I believe Brian was a strong candidate for some ✨a q u a t o f a n a ✨
"Are we in Clue?" 🤣😂😆
This town is right next to the town where Joshua maddux is from, don’t know if you ever did his case
Thank You cheers from Pennsylvania 👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Please do a story on corpsewood
Please do Aaron Hernandez. X
Do Joel Rifkin!!! JOEL RIFKIN JOEL RIFKIN!!
OMFGGG, I LOVE YOUUUUU I MISSED YOU SO MUCH OOOOF I CAN;T EVEN EXPLAIN!!!!!!!!!!!
I MISSED YOU! *mad tone
You should really do a series like "horror , mystery and makeup" where you talk about actually paranormal activities or encounters , bassically real life horror stories/mysteries
Slapping meats together 💀
Hi Bailey......HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!  Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE your shows.   Just an FYI.......the PEACEMAKER was made for the US ARMY back in 1872 and was adopted by western law enforcement......I believe that the "PEACEMAKER" name referred to "keeping the peace" or taking out the bad guy......lol.  Love your show !!! You are SUPER HOTT !!!!!  Mike
i am in love with this eye shadow look
You should do one on Mark Minnie. He discovered a government cover-up about child trafficking and wound up dead.
your vibe always brings me happiness when i'm feeling down, thank you bailey 🤍
My home town. 👻🖤
He died on Jan 2 2022,
Hey Bailey please watch Finding Kendrick Johnson
And the police were like  "Yeah" 😂😂😂
I love you bailey!
It's Monday!!! I love Mondays. A new baily video will be out today YES!
Bailey's vibe is just one in a million! 💯. Like she's the friend you'll always love to have around!! You a real one 😌
This is so sad because all you had to do was be faithful in your marriages, if you're not happy, divorce. Simple
Great story 🎉♥️
A SUSPISH BIKE SHORT?! Who said- WHO SAID THAT?! Who said it?
Hey Bailey ! Has anyone ever asked you to do the Tamla horsford story??? I want details and I think you’d be the best to do it, or Angela Simpson 🤷🏽‍♀️
its so strange to hear someone talk about your home town and then consider it a small town after saying 500,000 people live there xD
I have/had lupus. After 11yrs of suffering, I did chemo for it & have been in remission for 12 years now. 🦾 Strength to my fellow lupus who are exhausted & trying so very hard. I see you, you're valid. ❤️
💗💛💙
I love Bailey she reminds me of me
JenniFER 🤣🤣
how is this not boring help
Well what do you know...I have lupus😂 what a coincidence
Thank you mom
Can you do the Kendrik Johnson case when you come back? Please.
Can you do one on Dr. Hicks? I wanna know more!
queen
Can you do an episode on twins Jas and Tas Whitehead?
I miss seeing your videos on Facebook :/ For some reason they don’t recommend them to me anymore.
They both deserved a lifetime with no parole.
please do the stephen mcdaniel case no one has talked about him that i know of
Finally i get a break, I'm so happy i get to relax with one of your videos. <3
I think anyone who believed his stupidass story is…not very bright, to say the least.
why do they all smile in the mugshots?!😂🥴
I have the same shirt!😁😂  making sure I take it with me to West Key on vacation in hopes I finally run into another die hard Bailey fan.
Bailey can you do Maury Travis?
Yassss guuuurrrl....im here for it!
22:56 Lol
That poor woman. I have Lupus. It’s debilitating. I can’t imagine my husband doing this to me.
They very obviously we're trying to frame Ben, but didn't take into account that he had a solid alibi
Hi Bailey! I just wanted let you know how much I appreciate your authenticity and how relatable you are. I watch your videos a TON when I'm travelling for work. Your videos are comforting to me (despite what they may be about lol). I hope everything is going YOUR way, you seem like a great person. ❤️
The peacemaker model is called that because it was Wyatt Earp's gun and that's what he called his.
I’m from Colorado Springs!!!!! It’s beautiful! And I think Brian definitely played a bigger role! What a piece of garbage.
What Eyebrow makeup are you using.... And eyeliner?
Amy Fisher please
Please research Blanche Taylor Moore!
Jennifer just isn’t very smart here. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Love the hair and make up
If you ever do stories of other countries , you should do the frog boys south korea
If brian told multiple friends and did life insurance hes guilty he definitely was involved
Can you do a video about Erica Parsons?
Colorado Springs is NOT a cute little charming town 😅😅 if you're gonna go somewhere in Colorado Bailey I would recommend either somewhere in the mountains, or Denver, Boulder, or Fort Collins. Those places I think probably fit your vibe more than the springs 👀😅
Look up book Innocents Lost Midlothian  tx
Blue imposter threw pink imposter under the bus and got away with it
Hi Bailey I love you!! Please do a video on house of horrors its such an interesting case from what I know of it and would love to hear it from you and your opinions
Hi Bailey, would love it if you could do a episode on Robert William Pickton. He is from British Columbia, Canada. He fed his victims to his pigs 🤮.  Thanks for reading my comment. 😊
Asking an opinion. I see a lot of makeup gurus spraying their sponge with the finishing spray instead of just spraying it towards the face. Have you tried this and what do you think about it?
On another note… can you pls bless us with a hair tut on this?   Also, missed you 🥲
I would love for you to tell the story of Elyse Pahler … central coast California! Devastated our small community in the mid to late 90’s.
I always find it interesting when a population of 250k people is considered "small town". Like really? I grew up in a town (age 4 to 16) of just under 500 people. I grew up with the same 12 kids in my class - and each class was about the same size and all grades were in the same buildings... Then I moved to a town of a bit over 30k people and people said that was small, I would laugh 😂 now I'm just in awe about what a big city would be like, like y'all must be climbing over each other in the streets 😂
You need to look up John Strutz in Delhi, Ohio. It was a crazy case I'd love to see you cover. I went to high school with him and he did some pretty horrific stuff to his wife.
when san angelo tx is mentioned 💀
I'm new to this channel so I don't know if this case was covered yet (I looked but didn't see it) - Jennifer Dulos. If not, look into it.
Hi Bailey. Please do a story on Janet Chandler (conspiracy of silence) 🙏
Slapping meats together 🤣
If you would, please cover the Junko Furuto case.  I pray her story keeps her memory alive!
I'd love to hear about the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles...also, all of the young girls who disappear from the Antelope Valley in California.
Please do the chicago ripper crew
Please consider doing Marie Hilley, Andrea Yates, jonbenet Ramsey, Andrea Gonzalez in Russellville Alabama, Judith Neelley. @baileysarian
♥♥♥♥♥♥
Have you talked about Tamla Horsford? I feel like it wasn’t covered enough and I think if anyone could give us the details it would be you!
Can you do a story on the West Memphis 3?
Please cover the Kurim case!
Very pretty makeup 💄
Bailey!!!!!! When are we getting hair tutorials cuz this style is super cute ☺️
Can you do a story on Zach and addie from new Orleans?
Wo sind meine Deutschen Grusel Fans ? 😙
Idk what to think about their release, perhaps the lady got what she deserved, and Brian should be imprisoned. Anyhow, have you seen the news from New Mexico about the 18 year old woman disposing of her newborn baby in a dumpster. Her mother is defending her child. I mean bad choices and who is to blame?
You should talk about Daniel Rolling!! Love you Bailey! 🖤
I have a doozy of a story for you. Magdalena Solis and the Hernandez brothers. A story full of manipulation, Incan Gods and human sacrifice.
i also have lupus 💜💜
I believe The Peacemaker was Wyatt Earp's gun.
You should do a video on Brookey Lee West, if you haven't yet.
Bailey, very genuine personality.  Love the make up.  Great job at story telling. It is always entertaining.
"Thank youuuii"😂 your the best
Just realized she was killed the day I was born 9/12/90 absolutely insane
Nah...life...boffem.
I keep asking if Bailey every did a vid about Jefferey Macdonld i believe his name was there was a movie done about it in the 80s he was in the military and killed his whole family on base i think.....look into it Bailey. Thank you... byyyyyyeeeeee👋👋
I love how you whispered science 💀💀
They both should have gotten life. Stress probably caused her cancer. I do believe that, you can say she did get life, do you know what I mean??? It was premitated., At least that is what it sounds like, with the insurance. I hadn't heard about this. It was great to hear a new story. Thanks Bailey. Great job as always.🌹❤️
i think they used brians gun as an attempt to frame him to get rid of both spouses
And ur so funny, which makes u more attractive and I think u are just as beautiful without make up and u are a great story teller to boot🙏🥰
Both! Love your slang - slapping meats lol. I’m sick under a blanket with Vicks and your podcast!
I may not give two um hoots about make up lol. However beautiful women like Bailey and true crime a superb combo. Sssh don't tell the others but ur my fave💙😘
I’m from Springs and nothing charming about it 😂 very small though and us locals, while we appreciate the Army, actually ignore them. You seen one you seen them all
Why do they both look so creepy in their mugshots???? Ew
Your hair looks great Bailey. Love listening to you each week
may i request Stephen Peter Morin
Bailey: "I wanted to change my background." Me: There is something other than this beautiful woman on the screen?
I swear she’s the funniest person😂😂
The end of today's theme song was very Mona-Lisa from Parks & Rec inspired. 'Moneeey. Pleease!'
“Are we in clue?” I DIED 🤣🤣🥴
Love your YouTube channel Bailey! Huge fan 😍
Interesting case!!! There's a case out of Oklahoma: Money, police corruption, the April Wilkens case.
I just had a *Bailey moment*... I am doing my beauty routine, having a Bailey's drink and watching Bailey :) :)  my life is perfect
Your cover on Diane’s cancer was done like a true professional 👌
Lol Colorado Springs is lowkey a dump now not a cute town
I believe in Karma!  Hopefully he became multiple men’s girlfriends in prison.  He’ll get his!
Haha my name is Jennifer and I was listening to the video while making waffles and When Bailey goes Jennifer Jenniferrrr and I kept looking over!
Paul Bernardo amd Karla holmoka
Now I know how Bailey would say my name 😂
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, make your * Theme song* an iOS ringtone!!!❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤
Your the besttttttt
Have you heard of the Fitzel family or the Groves?
poor ben :(
I just want to hear the silent twins story from bailey 😭
Both are the same
Do the case of Miriam Rodriguez who killed all the cartel memebers responsible for her daughters death!
The poor kids
Love you Bailey, do the case of Cho doo-soon
Whenever I hear Colorado Springs I think of Joe Kenda Homicide Hunter (what a Legend)!
They both should have gotten life in prison, no chance did parole. What happened was not justice. A woman and a mother was taken away, I don't care if she was manipulated and he was the puppet master. It's just sad.
Brian. Narcissistic psychopath.
Just placed an order for some suspish merch! I got the pink shirt and black pants. $18.95 for shipping is INSANE but I wanted it so 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ worth it!
Hi bailey, will you do a russell williama episode please?
You should look into the mass shooting in Nova Scotia in April 2020 with Gabriel Wortman he impersonated a cop and went around shooting people. There’s many theories on why he did it and it would be interesting for you to tell the story. I live in the town and was out when this was all happening. ❤️❤️
You should look in the James Bulger story
I think it was both of them because I honestly think as fake as Jennifer sounds, i think she's dumb and naive enough to be manipulated. Kind of like her cornbread wasn't done in the middle. Neither of their justifications made sense.
YAY, BAILEY!!!! LOVE YOU!!!❤️👍💯💯
9more sleeps
It was around oct 2020 I found this channel.  At that time it had 3 million subs I do believe.  That is 3 million new subs in just over a year.  You go girl!
“What in the time traveler? Are we in Clue?” 🤣🤣😭
Bailey!! Please do one on the Burari case
i would love for you to do a video of Bob  Berdella, if you haven't done so l already! it was a fairly big case but unfortunately only 2 documentatries, that have terrible music placement.
I think they both should have gotten  life, no parole.  Love your hair and make up. You are so pretty. And just an awesome person.
True crime suggestion Robert Farquharson (Australia)
❤️Ana
@baileysarian you certainly should cover the junko furuta case.... the sad horror that girl suffered boggles the mind.
Maybe she was released because she was diagnosed with cancer? would the govt/system pay for that while she is in jail? and being released she was left to foot the bill herself and there fore died?
Can I ask why her theme song spotify (in some) is different? 🥺
BAILEYYYYY could u cover the jaliek rainwalker case from albany, ny
People smiling on their mugshots screams innocent
i soooo like your humor😂😂
i missed you baeee
Please can you do a story about the ice man (Richard Kuklinski ) 🥺💕
"Brian, come on in"! What?😂😂💀
Should have thrown the key away. Both of them!
Couldn’t control myself after “slappin meats together” 😂😂😂👌👌👌
Am I the only one who thinks Jennifer is GORGEOUS? Sad story though.
Any other Jennifer's feel odd when they hear their name in videos.  It seems that people say Jennifer  alot of the times in a  jokingly way.
I never comment . But i love your hair like this .
Do Tamla Horsford!!
Can you do a video on Isabella Guzman
I live in Colorado Springs 😳and I love you… bye
Me, living in Colorado Springs saying “charming, cute town? Where?”
You are the best.
“Cooperation” should carry no weight.  Lock em up ⬆️
Is Colorado Springs considered a small town? I was there in the 1980s. It felt like a midsized town or small semi-suburban city, like much of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles.
The hair clips you use to hold your hair out of your face, what are those called? Love love love your vids!
I love Bailey Sarian 💕 watching from Philippines ☺️
I live in the springs...not a cute little town anymore! but we do have 5 military bases. My favorite thing though is pikes peak! Also sadly crime is becoming a relatively large problem here and guns are everywhere!
Brian sounds like a psychopath.
Finally my hometown makes it to the show! I was only 7 in 1990 so I just vaguely remember the case.
Thanks for actually looking into the camera while talking, it’s like you’re actually talking to the audience.. so many people just tend to stare at themselves the entire time in these types of videos.
250,000 a small town...? I never lived in anything above 70,000 and the biggest city in hundreds if not thousands of miles doesn't have 2,000,000 people.
You know what makes me sad their children! They are both guilty sorry ! And Jen yup that’s karma
"Leave me out of this, I've got miracles to do!" I am deceased.
Does anyone else live for the part in Baileys intro where she says “noggin’ “ maybe it’s just me 😶 love your work (and makeup!)
Used to watch you on Facebook, but recently decided to delete my account. Glad I bumped into your YouTube page, missed watching you. <3
You’re so cute, I can’t even…
“What in the time travel is going on? Are we in clue?” Had me rolling 🤣🤣🤣
Has Bailey done a story on Alyssa Bustemante yet? If not she should totally recap that story!
Dude not only is it always the husband but it's also ALWAYS the religious people
You’ve been missed Bailey!!! You look AMAZING as usual! 💕
Question...what time of day do you normally film these, and put on your makeup? If I were you I'd start at like 3pm haha
Colorado Springs is political and it's super evangelical. The rest of Colorado stays away.
NEVER apologise for taking a break. Whether it’s from filming or posting! We miss you like crazy but we’ll be here for you whenever you get back! You need breaks ❤️
i have forced my brother to watch so many of these he now does the *click* noggin
Jennifer Reali was my best friend's mom. It's a really sad story that was devastating for both families.
hearing bailey in the background of playing bioshock is my new favourite activity
Can we pleeeeaaaase get Bailey and Christina on a vid together!!!! 💜
One army base, 2 AFB, and the academy. I was stationed there. This case is pretty well known, but the Springs is grimey and I'm sure there are other wild ones.
Does anyone else mouth her intro everytime or is it just me 😂
shoutout to the flower shop guy
I think the reason why the victim's brother defended Brian was because Fatal Attraction had recently come out and people just thought women were crazy back then.
Im from Colorado but i feel like every episode on the ID channel is in colorado Springs.
can you do the axeman of new orleans
Why didn't they turn the gloves inside out to get prints?
This story was big in Colorado
Colorado Springs is very conservative.
Colorado Springs is not charming. I am a Colorado native. "Focus on Family" are located here....yes they are freaks.
Do a leopard 🐆 back ground
Your back grounds are epic
I like the ones that are still more of a mystery. Can you do more that are still unsolved?
S I X   M I L L I O N 🥳🎉👏🏼
Talk about Byron Smith
YOU HAVE NO IDEA THAT HER INFLUENCE IS OF DEMONS...................................
Slapping meats together……🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I’m dead😂😂😂😂😂
Currently watching this while I'm in quarantine I have Covid
I lived for 12 years in San Angelo, TX where ASU is located
Slapping meats 😂😂
I think this was a case of Joe Kenda’s! Definitely check him out on investigation discovery because he is amazing. Would absolutely DIE for a collab between Joe and Bailey
WHAT DID SHE SAY AT 12:00
I got an ad for Peacemaker on HBO at the beginning, didn’t really pay attention and skipped it, so when she started talking about the gun I was tripping out trying to figure out where I’d just heard that lol
My cat is OBSESSED with your voice it’s hilarious she comes running over and just stares at the screen 📺😂
So they tried to set Ben up as the perp, in which case he would go to jail and they would be free to be together?? Just what it seems like!
But like, it was the husband ! He should still be in prison though 🙄
Hope your Having a Happy New Year
I'm pretty sure they called it "The Peace Maker" because it litterally caused whoever was shot with it to lay down and shut up, never to speak or make noise again! 🤣🤣 I know that's not funny, but I have a sick sense of humor you'll have to forgive me 😉
You by FAR have the best theme song¡!
Not me living In colorado springs 🤭
6 million subscribers! Amazing!
37 years ...meanwhile Germany has so mild punishments, that this year 30 terrorists will be released and we are called out to prepare ourselfs for terror attacks
BAILEY! Let’s hear about the OJ Simpson case.
Yaaaaaay you’re back!
Shout out from San Diego! You make my day and make me smile!
Wasn't a fan at first, but you've grown on me and I am totally a fan now!!! And even though you're a Sag, I'm a Gemini and don't usually like Sags but am starting to see the charm!!! Totally crazy "theme song", lol!😂
Great look 🌪🔥
BAILEY, PLEASE DO BONNIE AND CLYDEEEEEE
What in the time travel is going on here. Lol
adore you. love the hair and gorgeous makeup look.  What a crazy story
Sounds like her brother was trying cash in on the life insurance policy. What sibling would try and give an alibi to an obvious suspect?
Did anyone else notice her pinky nail on the right hand doesn't have any red on it
Why is it always Jennifer or Jenny?!! Not all of us Jennifer/Jenny's are "crazy"😂😂😂 Need to change my name 😕😁😂
my 5 month old loves bailey sarian
PLEASE DO BONNIE AND CLYDE SOON (54th time trying this .... yes i counted)
I dont think she was tricked, I think she said that in hopes of getting a shorter sentence 🤔 but either way both of them should've been in jail
Bailey: like that just didn't make any sense, mhm mhm, sure does not  Me: *nodding my head in agreement* nay nay I say
I love the back ground!!!!
When she brought up Colorado I get chills
Does anyone know what foundation brush she's using?? I need it! And it doesn't say in the description.
why're they so smiley? :/
Hi Bailey, I love your videos and it’s honestly the only way I can consume content surrounding such awful stuff. It would be cool if you covered Mark “Gator” Rogowski. It kind of scares me that this guy is from my hometown. My uncle was talking about it at Christmas and apparently he used to hang out with Mark and was upset and shocked when everything went down.
Oh how i missed you
They released Jen b/c they didn't want to pay for her cancer treatment.
I know this is a terrible story but the way you tell it had me cracking up! Boom Shackalocka!!
HOW DO WE EXCHANGE SIZES?? I need a bigger size. Otherwise i wasted $163.00
You should do a clown style makeup with maybe a clown story bet u look super cute
I definitely think they should have been tried equally. Some of these cases that go to trail are just mind-blowing in the end results. Not all cases but quite a few
I said how nice your hair was before you mentioned it
Congratulations on 6 million!!!
First can I say I love everything you do!!! But can you do Anatoly Moskvin I just watched some things on him but I love how you tell the story so much better ❤️
you should do a video on Lauren Smithfield’s
What about Martin Bryant 👀
Elizabeth Congdon and the historical Glensheen mansion please Miss Bailey! 😍🤞🏻
I wonder did Joe Kenda Homicide Hunter work on this case?
"Are you a salesman or a preacher?" Brian: "Yes" 🌝
The pic of brian at 24:06, is totally channeling kevin bacon from footloose.. especially his hair! Lol.
It’s so true that you really don’t know what goes on behind closed doors. These stories definitely make you skeptical to comment on how couples appear on the outside :(
Both life sentences.  BTW makeup is awesome today ,love ya.
my name is Jennifer so you saying the name was so satisfying to me hope that doesn’t sound weird 😂
Do Vera Renzci next!!!!!!!!!!!! Please Bailey!
Have you done Elizabeth Bustamante yet?
my last name is hood. maybe my family has history i don’t know😂
Whispers*** “science” and I just bust out laughing. 🤷‍♀️
Missed you
Check out the story of Martha moxley
To hear you mention and explain what Lupus is made my heart so happy. Thank you❤️
I used to live in colorado springs
You should look up the story of Adrianne reynolds
After how much deliberation? You said 6 weeks at 28:34 - is that right?
I am literally 0.51 seconds in and I just had to stop the video to say you are just FABULOUS!! Your energy, sense of humour and quirky personality are just infectious and I love that!
I love the fact that my name is also Jennifer and I was born in Colorado Springs, makes me feel more connected to todays story
What happened to their kids !? You’re missing information 🥲
Bailey, please do a piece on Dr Michael Swango. The case is wild, you will find it interesting.
I definitely think they talked about it maybe a lot! But at the end of the day, Jennifer pulled the trigger so she should’ve gotten more time.
Do Anatoly Moskvin
I’m surprised they even saw him
Please do a video on precious doe
You should do the Lindbergh baby kidnapping :)
What happened to the kids?? That’s what I want to know.  And I think they were equally responsible. I don’t think he tricked her.. I think it was both their sick idea
I always get more freaked out when she does these and it ends up happening in my state 😳 also Colorado Springs is beautiful & less expensive 😂
Jennifer....JENNN-EE-FURR
I love Baily..found her last year by accident n ended up binging that entire week! Lol I thought I was tge only nutty person that laughs during horror movies n stuff like that hahaha..I'm glad to see so many ppl like me!! Lol I also love her sense of humor is just like mine..n love her singing her theme song Lol cracks me up everytime! Lol thanks Bailey fir making us laugh so hard!! 🤣
Your theme song has been stuck in my head today. I am getting weird look at work when I randomly start singing sanna sa Sanna sa you get thr idea..
I'm from Colorado and Colorado Springs is absolutely beautiful!
You make Colorado Springs sound so much nicer than it is😂
I really wanna hear u talk about the Wesson family massacre I haven’t seen many.
You should make a none edited makeup video🥺
Have you heard of The Gary Plauche story 😱 Crazy!! Was justice served 🤔
Have you ever heard of brazen bull torture device? You should look into them if you haven’t! They’re terrifying
jonathan lawrence jeremiah rodgers Wanna be cannibles! Do a story on them!
Wow! My name is Diane. My husbands name is Brian. We have 3 kids. I have lupus! That’s where the similarities end! ( I hope) and we live in a military town!
You should totally do a video on magdalena solis that lady is all kind of crazy 🤣
Can you please do Hadden Clark?! I love your videos!
It is always the church leaders... istg
beautiful make-up today!
I just heard about Noela Rukundo surviving kidnappers her husband hired to put a hit out on her, and she showed up to her own funeral!
bailey, could you please do a video on the brianna denison case and please give out information and ask your followers to put pressure on the police in midland, texas to help find her cousin, caitlin denison who went missing in 2018? they're both from my city reno, nevada and many of my friends and i are really missing caitlin. it would mean a lot to have both brianna and caitlin cases shed light on your page and to your followers. 🤍 love you so so much!
Happy New Year!! 🎊  I pray that you have an amazing 2022 🥰
2nd time commenting this! I have no other socials but what’s with the ring?!?!?!?!!?!?
Love how you say my name
Bailey you really should look into Darla Routier and do a video on her .......please..
William Devin Howell
"Brian!? Come on in?!" Jus KILLED ME☠️😂😭
9:00
250k is not a small town....
If she had any moral compass she wouldn’t have killed his wife regardless of being coerced to do it. It was a weak argument on her part.
Put it up to her?  Don't you mean "put her up to it"?
Like like like like. Grow up.
You forgot the theme song girl.
Do one about Rick Simonds
Until now i was super convinced that the Peacemaker was a fictional gun from Wynonna Earp
Gross, hard pass
The average amount of time spent in prison under a life sentence before release in Ireland is around 18 years How fu€Ked is that
I’m sorry but I’m absolutely howling at “babe I want a gun” 😂😂😂😂😂 at 19 mins approx
this was an episode of “colorado springs, detective joe kenda” x
PLEASEE do the story of Anatoly Moskvin!!!
“He was in the army” me: it was her
Hope Bailey would also talk about Asian true crime stories - I suggest Pepsi Paloma's case or the Ozone Disco tragedy both from the Philippines
The way you tell these stories feels like you’re exploiting the the events that happen. You literally just google these stories and tell them to further improve the entertainment of you applying makeup. Maybe leave it to the other channels that cover this content respectfully.
Bailey you deserve a break from making these videos ❤️❤️❤️ you're so amazing 🌟
Slappin meats together 😋
Have you ever did the Cleveland strangler? If not that one would be very interesting and a little gorry unfortunately!!
Gah I love you!
Can you do Fidel Lopez? Been rewatching his interrogations and this guy is just something else 🤮 I won't blame you if you take a whole month off after this case
Bailey can you do a vid of Selena Quintana pls
My gosh, you’re so pretty without makeup 😍
I love you
Bailey: clicking multiple times to get the noggin click right me: oh no the clickers broken 😂
100% need a "Where Are They Now?" !
Watched this... work at the Academy and live in the Springs and I was just like well okay! A local one. Thanks Bailey for something new I didn't know!
Hope these catches your eyes.. Thank you. I love my me time.   Investigators in Ohio have found 89 sets of cremated remains in an abandoned church in Akron.
Also the story of Mary Turner. 😢
Do us natives a favor don’t talk up Colorado we are closed!!
*me living in Colorado Springs my entire life*  Bailey: I hope to visit it’s so cute! Me: oh Bailey, no 😅
Stories like this always make me think "Is this really the best solution to not loving your spouse anymore? Maybe just separate/divorce like normal people??????"
I would love for you to tell the story of Emmett Till. The woman responsible is still alive. Please Let the world See! The more the better
Please do a video on the Gainesville Ripper!
Your eye makeup is cute
Cool. Something that happened here made it to bailey's channel 🥰❤COLORADO SPRINGS WHOOT WHOOOOOOT!!!!😝🤘🏼 Lol
Bailey, would you please do Betty Broderick? 🙏🏼
"Are we in Clue?" FAVORITE THING!
South Carolina Murdaugh case
My first thought when the video started was ‘wow her hair is really cute’ 😀
Happy happy happy NewYear.  Bailey I just love 💕 ya!!!
SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE FIGHTERS! 🔥🙌🏽
Am i the only one that was thinking bennifer every time she said ben and Jenn??? Sorry im a jlover😭😭
😁👍🏻
Welcome back
Its ALWAYS the husband! Or the husband's mistress!
Can you do Eric Harris & Dylan Klebold?
Please never change your hair color this is so gorgeous natural and fits you very nicely ♥
Have you already done the Elisa Lam case? It’s so crazy
Starting to notice all of my favorite streamers and YouTubers overthink and generally believe they're underprepared. I so identify. 💜💜💜💜💜
Bailey going off about why she thinks the gun is called the "peacemaker" Youtube: plays an ad for peacemaker with John cena
Your hair clips 😍
I recommend looking into the Turpin case if you get a chance , it’s interesting but disturbing and you just wonder what was going thru the parents’ minds when they did all those things to their kids
Slappin meats together!!  BHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!
Ben and Jen Brian and Diane  I'm dying 😂
That smiling prison mug shot is so disturbing.  Dude doesn't look like he's really learned anything or has much remorse.  Wouldn't be surprised if he winds back in prison.  Another great video from Bailey!!
You should talk about Kendrick Johnson! Suspish !!!
My 2022 started with omicron! My 2020 started the same way! Binge watching your videos makes it better!
well she used Ben´s clothes and gun plus she gave it back to him so I do belive they wanted to take Ben too...
I think Ben gave Jen the peacemaker just incase she ever decided to off him, he’d have time to run due to the reload time 😂
No man is worth ruining your life over!!
Baileyyyyyyy I love u bisssssssh💜😈😝 been here since 2020😌
I think that Jennifer probably wasn't tricked or manipulated, but instead that Jennifer and Brian were partners who deserved equal sentences.
I think if something happened to Chris Pratt's wife that the police or someone needed to talk to him, he would say something similar.
Your makeup is fabulous! And yeah, they were totally in on this together.
Girl where tf u been
Every day since the 1st of january ive been looking for the monday videos🙁 and this week i was very busy not looking and just now i thought let me look today and bammmmm💥💥 you are backk🎊🎊 **happy dance**
Happy new year! Love youre hair! So beautiful
All single action guns need to be "cocked" manually. Yall get ur heads outta the gutter😂. It has nothing to do with the age of the gun. There are many single action guns still made today.
I dunno Jennifer smiling in her mugshots makes me think she knew exactly what she was doing…the ladies can lie and manipulate too you know
Hi Bailey love your stories I'm subscribed love from SCOTLAND ⚘⚘⚘🌷🌷🎉🎉
I like the phrase "robbery gone wrong" I think robbery is wrong so it wasn't gone wrong its all wrong from the start no matter how it ends .  Lol js
my mom and i got positive today so binge watching these 😂 thank you
“Let’s hope that 2022 treats us right” she gave me Covid :(
"What in the time travel is going on" "meet slapping each other "🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣love your videos
He cocked it and finished on her chest lol
22:57 😂
You should do the child called it
Great video
could you maybe do the gabby petito case?
You are so funny sweetie. My granddaughters watch your videos too!
Bailey you are so BEAUTIFUL I CANT I may or may not have a pic of you on my wall and have murch ♥️😌
Am I the only one who dances when she does the theme song?!  Lol cause I dance and I’m not assumed 🤣
It BLOWS MY MIND as a British person that you can literally buy guns, even in your supermarkets in America ! We just can’t get over it 😳
When prisoners get cancer they will let them go so the state/federal government doesn’t have to pay the treatments.
Happy New Year Bailey!
Literally enjoying MMMM sitting in a therapeutic milk and oatmeal bath. Best experience ever. My dry skin is having a literal drink. Highly recommend for winter dry skin
Bailey is my fav 💕
I think they were trying to get “rid” of Ben by using his gun and military clothing ?
I've been to Colorado springs
i just got some Dark History sweet pants ❤😌
Bailey sarian, i think the reason he gave that to her was to help her. In those situations it's easy to get jumpy and fire wildly because of adrenaline. That kind of gun forces you to slow down take a breath and aim. It helps accuracy in less experienced shooters or those less used to stressful situations . Imo
Bailey can you do a story on Gabriel Fernandez? I wanna hear what happened to the parents but I can’t find much
That's wyatt earp's gun!!!
eye freaking roll 🤣😂
No my dear Bailey! Its called peace maker cause after you shoot them, you never have to deal with them again so you've got your peace!! Lol at least that's my definition!! I'm sot really sure why it's called that either! 🤷🏻‍♀️😊
You should do the Marcus Wesson massacre!
It is not a small town anymore, and it's not charming 🤣 Please don't come here haha
Wasn’t Peacemaker Wyatt Earps gun?… 🤔… I could be wrong.
That gun would be thousands (20,000-60,000) of dollars. I know, I wanted one and settled for a recreation El patron.  It was called peace maker because it Wyatt Earps gun and he was the first law enforcement in a small developing town riddled with gangs and violence. Hence a “peace” maker👍
What happened to the kids....
You should do the story that inspired the amber alert
i miss your old outro music.
Bailey please please do a makeup tutorial? Esp for the contouring steps. I’ve watched your videos over and over to learn from your mad makeup skills and you’re hilarious!
I enjoy your videos. I'll play it when doing house chores then watch at the end to see the final makeup look. Interesting stories all the time and great makeup!!! ❤👏
my favorite investigator joe kenda investigated this case!!
I would love to hear you cover the Michelle Knotek story!
Love you ♥️  May i please ask if you can cover a story on Robert Rhodes??  Thank you for putting so much love and efford into everything you do.
Thank you so much for describing what Lupus is not everyone understands since its an invisible disease and we are often misdiagnosed and mostly misunderstood.  Love your crime and makeup videos,  when I have a flare and I have to be in bed rest when I watch your videos it cheers me up, not the story because they are mostly F*****up and have a sad ending but the way you describe it and put emotion in to it! Keep it up girl.  Thank you.
I had to pause the video. Slapping Meats took me OUT😭💀
you are so awesome, talented and extremely beautiful! love your videos, wish you only the best! cheers from brazil!
This was a boring one. 😒
He sounds like a cult leader in the making. He should still be in prison. What a coward.
What's with the goofy grins from both parties that's creepy and shows their guilt in my opinion
Fatal attraction killed my grandmother before I was able to meet her
Any way we can bring awareness to Melvin Ortiz case?
Replaying this just to hear Bailey say my first name
Hi Bailey what brush did you use for your foundation? X
Even as a Christian his response first date was creepy. That's not something anyone would say if they were genuine
"Slapping meats" has me dead 🤣🤣
Ayyye. I have Lupus 😂. You repped the lupus def correctly. Thanks queen 👑💖
I listen to these while I drive for work, and let me tell you every time you said "JENNIFER" in a (justifiably) accusing way, I felt personally attacked 🤣💀
You should do some hairstyle tutorial vids too😭💗💗
Have you done Dean Corll? Or the Ant Hill Kids and Roch Thériault??? I would love to know what you think about those vile humans.
2022 is already shaping up to be a complete sh!+ show dumpster fire. But yeah 2022!!!!!
where did you get the clips
Bailey i love your content so much I subscribed to your channel about a year ago and I'm in love with it i would really love if you do the gucci story   And thank you so much for doing makeup and telling crime stories i really found that interesting   Thank you  Aviah🖤💜🖤
It ain't charming here 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I know where bailey is coming from, but only in this one case is the life insurance not really that suspicious. She had a horrible disease and could lose her battle at any time. It makes sense to have insurance to cover funeral costs. But that doesn’t mean he is all innocent.
I was living in Colorado Springs back then it very much is a military town. That is a sad story, I do feel Brian got off lightly. I think they were trying to frame poor Ben. Slapping meats, laughed out loud while listening at work on my lunch break at my desk.
Probably somewhere in the middle
So I went to Angelo State and I was not ready to here them mentioned here lol
Can someone please provide the sheet music to the theme>
im hoping you post a video on the 24th its gonna be my birthday and i adore your content
your hair is so cute
From Colorado,,, but Brian actually died on the 3rd of January this year 😳
So happy you’re back, definitely makes mondays feel less… Monday? lol   Also! Would be super rad if you did a video on Dorothea Puente
Some revolvers require u to pull back the hammer each time to move the cylinder. The wife? That why so short?
Me: *thinking* It's the husband. Bailey, three seconds later: I know you're at home thinking it's the husband....  I feel so called out 😆
I’m sad when you’re gone!!!
When you said "slapping meats" I almost choked on my food lol.
You should make a video about Elyse Pahler. The story that inspired Jennifer’s Body!
Wow she’s at over 6M subs I started watching her when she was at 600k I knew she would blow up The Bailey secret is out
I live in Denver. There is a reason why Colorado Springs is really cheap. It's not the best of places. Lol don't go there
Is that foundation brush the rephr one? Somebody else mentioned it in a vid, can’t remember who, but they said it’s awesome. Tempted! Do I NEED it? No. Do I WANT it. Yes 💜
I suggest the Alissa Turney case for a future episode!
Can you please cover the death of Lauren Smith Fields. About a bumblee date in CT gone wrong
Please make a shirt that says "I dont know what in the time travel is happening right now" Bailey pleaseeeeeee
My hometown. Okay, moved here in 1996. Loved this town. At least the views and weather. We are military and more conservative.
22:08 I was having a bad day and started watching this. Never thought I'd hear baily say this but it made my f-ing day.🤣🤣
Have you ever heard of Jennifer Daugherty and the Greensburg six? It’s something that happened in my hometown years ago. Definitely something to take a look at (and maybe do a video on.)  btw, I love your content! you have such an amazing way at telling stories! 🤍
That is one manipulative dude
“Look, you little kitty cats”
I love the way she explained thing❤️❤️. Could you please do Frank Gusts🙏
I’ve missed you 🥺🥺🥺
💜 Gods impresión 🤣😇
You should do a supernatural Saturday where you talk about weird events and mystery like aliens, weird unusual events in locations like the triangle
Still  ROCKING  that theme song!   Never ever lose it, no matter what the haters say. WE LUV U
A lot of people are probably going to hate me for this, but can you please do a video on the Warrens, if you haven’t already !?!? New subscriber here ❤️
I pocket flagged your video by accident, so sorry! Love you Bailey ❣️
Can you do Shawn Grate please
Pulling the mic away during the last note of the theme song is a mood! Get it girl!
Can you look in to Zachary Bowen please!
"slappin' meats together"
"Slapping meats together"..... IM DEAD!
“What in the time travel is going on here?”  😂
"slapping meats together " haahahha
BAILEY,  you are the highlight of my week, lol, my hubby giggles in the next room and says he loves to hear me giggling when I watch your videos.
both guilty. dont believe Jennifer. she did what she did
"I'm The Devil, And I'm Here To Do The Devil's Work"
Hi Bailey. Please do a story on Josef Fritzl
So many cases like this...divorce is an option y'all
250 000 small town? Wth that's a pretty big city from where i am from 😂
“Brian, come on in” … “Jus’ kiddin” lol Love Bailey ❤️
Her and that man actively decided to ruin two innocent lives for their own selfish gain. (Just get a divorce) I think because she was the one who ultimately pulled the trigger she absolutely should of gotten more time than the man. He pulled out the life insurance last minute so he was obviously a part of the planning, not disputing that. Just not buying the "boohoo I was manipulated" part.
Bailey, could we have an update about the Dark History episode about the Armenian genocide? Will it ever happen? 😰
Do the Patrick wood crusius story! The one that happened in EL PASO!!!! Please !!!!
Lupus. Webmd yup self diagnosed. Got crohn’s and arthritis home run would be psoriasis and ankylosis spondylitis
its that gun that you would see in westerns and the cowboy is holding down the trigger and continues to use his hand to push down the hammer
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS QUEEEN IS BACK MISS YOU BOO!!!!!!!
Thank you for yet another story, you tell them so entertaining.❤️❤️  I think the peacemaker was Wild Bill Hickocks gun and he called it that cuz it "kept the peace", you know. Thats why it's still called that.
I love watching the series.  you should go over the shannon syders case.  would love to see your take on it
Had nothing to do with this episode but for anyone who watched Dexter New Blood Dose anyone else think the Podcaster and Bailey have similar ways just saying
How did you leave out that Detective Joe Kenda solved this case?!!??
I love when she uses her make brushes as a phone to cute😍
I literally just moved to San Angelo Texas. 😕creepy.
There are way too many Brian's out there. The evil hiding behind religion.
10:15 “what in the time travel is going on? Are we in clue?” 😂
Anyone knows if Bailey ever talked about BTK?
For jesus hahahah
Why are these people smiling in their mugshots? So strange.
I love this makeup look and the hair!! You look like a Goddess!!
Can you cover David Koresh please
I'm just sitting here thinking where are the kids during all this??
STOP ANGELO STATE I GO THERE BAILEY
DEANNE HASTINGS plz cover this missing persons case
please do DEANNE HASTINGS/Crider a missing spokane, WA woman and mother of three. She went missing 6 years ago (as of November 4th 2021)  the story never got the coverage it should have. the only people whove heard of it was on the local news when it first happened maybe on the one show there is (that isnt all corect) and i feel youre the person to get the story going.
jidion w
I wonder if the people in these stories have seen these videos and tv shows made about them. I wonder if they like them. 😅
The squicky voice you do
Lol the little "EH" at the end of the intro 🤣💯
When she said Colorado Springs my jaw DROPPED ive never hured a case that happened where I grew up and live
My question is if Bailey's ever had any official intro songs offers 🤔🎶🕵‍♀️
I believe that you should comment on Paulette Gebara suspicious  death. She was a Mexican preschooler from a prominent family.
"peacemaker" because it kills the other person and you are left at peace!
Jen and Ben 😂
Love the way you described lupus. I'm a lupus warrior and sometimes we get a bad description
Not popular opinion - She was the manipulative one. I mean look at the way she smiles in her mugshot. Something wasn't right about that lady.
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey….. it’s essssscape. Not excape. Escape.
your hair is so volumptuous bestie<3
Police do some 💫💫tests💫💫
22:40 has me 🤣 💀🪦🏴‍☠️
1.7 million views and not one dislike 😳 the first I’ve ever seen !! Not that she should but I’m impressed
As a Jennifer this was a bit difficult to listen too 🤣 JENNIFERRR!
They definitely deserved the same amount of time.. Theres no way anyone could convince or manipulate me to take someone elses life! I wonder how their kids took all of this
Haven't even watched the video yet but I'm so happy to see you're back!! As I sit here in my True Crime Club t shirt, I'm ridiculously excited for a new MM&M ala Bailey ❤
Bailey laughed that Ben gave her a slow gun and how that would have been a harder gun to have for her protection. But maybe he was thinking in case she used it on him he would be able to get to her before she shot him again cause he probably figured she was a bad shot as well…
“slapping meats” ?! 😭😭😭😂😂😂
Does anybody Else Announce & Sing along the Whole intro with Bailey? My Sanasuhs are getting so Dramatic 😂❤️
I've always wanted to live there
I need to know what kind of brush she used for contour 😍 the gold one
Possibly took out the life insurance policies based on her illnesses??? Thats the max I got there.
You should talk about the menedez brothers next week.
Love you Bailey
I have watched you since the beginning of your MMM, I have gotten to see the theme song come about! I love your videos
please do the story of oj simpson!
I’ll tell ya what. Our governor here in ole CO is the worst. Hearing he allowed her to be released doesn’t surprise me one bit.
Yay you’re back 👑💞💞
As she describes the assault, and mentions that the shooter goes after Diane Me: It's personal
Literally took place the year and where I was born! My mom recalls lots of news coverage that kept her from getting my birth certificate lol I’m an army baby!
Hello Ms. Bailey , Thank you for taking the time to make your videos and telling stories. 🙂👍🏼
Bailey please make a video about Steven Pladl
Please talk about the Crystal Rogers disappearance in Bardstown, KY!! There are so many pieces and layers to that story and town.
Hiiiiii friends ❤️❤️❤️
Bailey: Todays story takes place in Colorado Springs Me: Oh my gosh i live in Colorado Springs 😮
Hey bailey I was wondering if you could cover stories about women and girls on American Indian reservations. For ex. Ashlynn Mike
BAILEY! PLEASE DO THE CASE OF DOROTHEA PUENTE!! ITS A STORY YOU WILL GET LOST IN!
This is awful at what goes through people's mind
Can you do a story from Nebraska?
you should cover the Zach and addy hall case from New Orleans
Karma has quite a sense of humor  LOL
When I was young I wore those butterfly clips all the time and the moving kind of ones.. 90's/ early 2000's
Yeah that's  Ist wacked.
So glad you’re back Bailey!   Is it weird, that I feel like we’re besties?  lol.
Listening to Bailey say my name over and over again is so weird!😂
"Let me think..... no." Love that.
Cute hair!
Bailey, your eye brows look higher, like lifted ..  they look great!
To many death's. I hope 22 is better.
Miss you bunches honey.
I live in CS. It's not charming. Lol. Love all your videos!!
I’m from Col-o-RAD-O not Col-o-ROD-O. Lol Coloradians inside joke. Haha all jokes aside. This was an interesting story this week.
Love your combo of true crime and makeup Bailey! You're super entertaining, especially your theme song.  I hope you won't change that!
Hope you can feature the story of Junko Furuta. It's so sad and tragic. 😢
What do you use in your hair??
Bonnie and Clyde next!!!!!
They should been charged equally 🤦🏻‍♀️
Did he not know about divorce? He could have separated from her rather than get her killed.
Oh Bailey, Colorado Springs is *not* charming... points for trying though
so I’ve been stuck in bed with Covid AND the flu, with my newborn. All we do is stream your videos and I am heartbroken that I have WATCHED. THEM. ALL. 😂💗 but I’ll watch reruns until new ones are posted. I even got the black Suspish sweatsuit for Christmas 🥰 Obsessed! Love you Bailey!!!
Anatoly Moskvin, from  Rusia. Please  talk  about  him
HA! "What in the TIME TRAVEL is going on right now?"
The queen is back 🖤
They tried to make it look like Ben did it smh
It doesn't take long to pull the trigger on that gun. All you do is pull the hammer back (little stick on the back). It hold 5 maybe 6 bullets. Then shoot. The cinlinder in the middle  automatically rotates to the next hole holding the next  bullet if it's a bullet in each hole. Pull the hammer back again let go and shoot. The Peace Keeper is a revolver. The gun we see in movies where people play Russian Roulette.
I’m convinced that you are SPOT ON about why it’s called the Peacemaker 😂 No one can tell me otherwise.
Jennifer was set up, if Brian didnt want her caught he"d have given her a less conspicuous gun, once the police found that it was undeniable her. Brian knew this, he expected her to go to prison and he could continue his relationship. Totally set up
SO great to see you once again!!!
What eyelash glue do you use? I can’t find one that last for me all day
I have lupus. It’s really rough. Going through an episode rn & I can barely move 😔
I don't get it how come here someone who killed a person with premeditation gets life but eventually is released, meanwhile, someone else in the US gets the death penalty for the same thing...
love you adorable personality Bailey..love u!
I have lupus and you explained that really well that’s how I explain when I don’t wanna go all in ahaha
I just heard a weird story about a man named Steven Kabuki. Very strange, would love to hear your take on it
💜💜💜
I’ll tell you what I think, I think I love you!
I love Bailey but that laugh annoys me
I was drinking something! Lol! It was all I could do from spitting it everywhere.  I they should have gotten the same jail time
Please do the Jonbenet Ramsey case!!
22:55 is where I fell out! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hi Bailey love the hair clips..........so love you much!  You rock 🤟☮💜
Ok ..everytime you said JENNIFER...IT creeped me out😅😫🤣 And she died day before MY birthday.
Colorado Springs is crazy conservative America. Avoid at all costs doll.
It's Always the husband, especially if said husband is religious.
I hate that her theme song causes ptsd now from her using it as an outro but high pitch blaring waking me up at 3am 😅
These two were probably the dumbest killers ever 🤦🏻‍♀️
You have more followers than some countries have citizens   congrats boo
Talk about Gerard Schaefer! Please.... it will be interesting and crazy to say the least!!!!
Please do the Cleveland kidnappings
I love your channel, Bailey! ✨
Do H.H. Holmes!! :)
Ironic I watched an episode of Deadly Women on this case last night
“Are we in Clue?” IM DEAD 😂
Bailey, it’s Thursday!!!! Lol
Glad you are back missed you!!! I have lupus and it’s no fun. I feel so bad for her may she Rest In Peace
The answer to you question, "how many people in Co Springs have an antique gun collection?" Is..... Probably WAY more than you'd expect! Lol Colorado is very pro gun!
I love your hair clips!! Where did you get them!? I’m obsessed! ❤️❤️❤️
Being from the Springs & hearing this is bone chilling
Of course it’s in Colorado Springs…. Cult capital of America
Your hair is indeed adorbs! ❤️
I missed you so muuuuuuuch
Ayyyeee I live an hour away from there! It’s absolutely gorgeous!!!  Love your hair! Girl, it’s so long!!! Yeeesssss!!!
Me, a military spouse living in Colorado Springs: “Please don’t lump me in with those people Bailey” 😂
The kids is who I feel sorry for :(
I'll tell you what; I normally say the intro word for word in sync with you, Bailey, but today you caught me off guard. That was a real suspish move -_- I got my eyes on you. P.s I love you so much and your MMMs really do help me get through my week every week so thank you <3
Okay so this video just got even more exciting Colorado Springs = Detective Kenda + Bailey covering a case that he probably worked <3! Two of my fav ppl on this planet
Why was it okay for Jen to get a divorce…like wouldn’t she be not forgiven??
I'm using "yip yappin" from now on 😅
Bailey I missed you, thank you for being wonderful!
i absolutely love your videos and look forward to them every week!! I just finished watching The Menendez Brothers tv series on hulu and GIRLLLL you gotta do a video on it!!! i would love to see what you think about it🤍🤍🤍
Looove the butterfly clips and your lip combo!!
My name is Buffy Fawn and I live in Colorado Springs. Definitely not a small town we're almost as big as Denver, we're the second largest city in Colorado. Just want to say how much you've inspired me for so many years. I love your personality and content.
Where is your accent from? I’m curious :)
I MISSED YOU 🖤
This was a wild story... I feel like he should have gotten life for sure. And as far as her..  she may have been guided to commit this crime, but she still pulled the trigger.
Why does this remind me of Riverdale??
I have lupus! Basically - our cells in our systems don’t have identifying flags - so our immune system thinks that healthy tissues are invaders so they attack. Nothing is identifiable to our white blood cells. Anything can cause it to happen- stress, anxiety, a cold, overworking. It’s crazy, but there’s manageable ways to handle.
*********do the tamla hartsford story pleaaaaasee***
both should spend life in prison
Jenifer is to blame
not me living in colorado springs and swearing i've seen that guy before lol
I got my merch!!  Wooo!!
Can't wait to see your new background!! 😘
Love your videos, they always keep me entertained while I do school work. Wondering if you've ever heard of Kitty Genovese and the bystander effect, I'm pretty sure you would like the story. Again love your videos <3
I know I can’t be the only one singing the theme song with Bailey!! 🤣🤣🤣
89k likes and 0 dislikes as it should be 😌
Totes ma-goats both are equally guilty. 🙄
Wow 6 mil! I remember when you barely started this 2-3 yrs ago
I had to stop listening because hearing my name said accusingly over and over is giving me anxiety. Lol
I just love your sarcasm!
So many ads a victim of your own loveliness, love your stuff, looking forward to whatever you are gonna do
I wonder what happened to their kids: Jen's and Brian's.
She is down to 🌍, I can literally see me hanging out alot with her!
I think they equally  should have had a life sentence. I hope Brian never got the life insurance, or it was given to the children.
Anyone know where those cute rainbow pearlescent hair clips are from?? Asking for me :)
Been following you for a while now always love how you keep it real I absolutely enjoy your videos woohoo bailey ☺️
Brian: *becomes born again and is a devote Christian/catholic* me: *assumes he knows the 10 commandments and knows that adultery is a sin* Brian: *cheats on his wife, THINKS that leaving his wife is more of a sin compared to adultery* me: UM SIR, WHAT?!?!?!
i died when bailey said they were “slapping meats” 💀
I mean it your hair is Gorgeous !!!!I hope you never cut it very short cuz you are glowing!!! Love from Iceland <3
Happy new year!!!!! We need some spooky buddies merch lol
i have a fever and have had a rough start to 2022. But you uploading made my day so much better 💖
I think Jennifer was a selfish B word and shot Diane on her own volition
i live in colorado springs 😭
Jennifer owed Diane’s family especially her children a big apology.
QUEEN
I grew up there during that time. 😳
You had me at slapping meats 🤣🤣🤣
SHESS BACKK
Could you please talk about Anders Behring Breivik, who massacred a bunch of young kids in Norway at a political camp? It's just about the only act of terrorism we've had here, and I'm interested to see your take on it.
21:07  ✨gasperella✨  moment just made my day 😂  10/10 will quote in the future
Both should have gotten life in jail
the u.s army adopted the new handgun in july 1873 naming it M1873 and bought 36,000 revolvers chambered in 45 colt caliber.The revolver was introduced to the civilian market two mounths later, acquiring the nickname the peacemaker in 1878 the peacemaker was introduced in jan 24 2019
Come on Bay! Do Lizzie Borden!!!!
This is not funny but what in the time travel is going on had me 💀💀
You look like Lindsay Lohan with your make up
I think a great MMM episode would be on JFK. That is still such a mystery to so many people. Even if you don’t do an episode on it, I would recommend Oliver Stone’s new 2021 documentary on Showtime “JFK:Revisited”. The amount of new information in that doc is insane, and I’m someone who has followed the JFK story for years. Anyways, love all your videos. ❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️
sny colorado springs case reminds me of Joe Kenda
Bailey is the beeeest
I’m in Colorado Springs and I have Lupus…🤨
we missed you bailey!! so glad you got a much needed break :)
Can u please talk about Cédrika Provencher? Nobody talks about her disappearance anymore.. she’s a young girl from Trois-Rivière, in Quebec so there’s not a lot of people that know about her (terrible) story  Btw I love your videos, and makeup and u girl
We missed you. Happy to hear your stories again.
I am so late to this party but I GOTTA know where did you get your little hair clips? I use to have some butterfly ones like that back in the day and would love more of them!!!
Happy 2022
Bailey can you please do a video on the old Hollywood actress Natalie Wood I read her sisters view on the situation and I feel like it should be more known.
I swear if theres one thing ive learned from all these stories its that if someone gets a life insurance policy taken out on them they should be placed in protective custody IMMEDIATELY😅
Love you, love your show! Has it ever crossed your noggin to have some sort of contest and 1 winner could be on the show and you do their makeup?  Totally live dark history also! ❤
Bailey feeling extra sassy today and I’m living for it 🥰🥰
This church leader really said his affair was "God's will" like the seventh commandment doesn't literally say "thou shalt not commit adultery" oml
I think you should refrain from "inviting" released felons to interact with you. What does your mother think of that?  Just be careful - we all want you to be able to keep telling stories & doing makeup.
The husband talked about it forever and then got insurance on her… in my bed Koolaid man voice “oh yeah” he did it
Can you do a video on Randy Robert
I think Jennifer acted on her own.... I mean Diane was already dying from lupus so it makes sense to get life insurance. Maybe Brians only crime was having an affair with a psychopath....
Hi love, 💗 really would love to hear a story on Andrew Cunanan. I’m small fashion designer who adores Versace. Decided to watch the The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story series & it was definitely a mouth dropper. Some of his victims were some of the worlds powerful men at the time & if not for the series I wouldn’t have known what made their empires & careers perished.
6 million subs Bailey ! Congrats! 🥳💜🥳💜🥳🤟🏽♾🥳🥳🥳
one case I would love to hear happened near me in northeast Pennsylvania. it is Robert and Joanna curley. she killed him(her husband) with an unusual type of poison thalium. it's a case that not many people know about. thank you so much for keeping us all entertained. I love your sense of humor and you are absolutely gorgeous!!
The extra struggle in the intro.. Super relatable to my life! 🤣 I live for you ❤️
I really enjoy these vids 😂
Beginning in the Wild West era through the American Civil War, all the way to the sets of some of the most iconic Hollywood Western movies, this legendary gun-shaped the entire culture. The Peacemaker was so much more than just one of the best-designed guns of the era.  It was this weapon that made the difference in the westward expansion by providing the much-needed protection of pioneers in the West. Additionally, it paved the way for the production of multi-shot firearms, which eventually would transform the United States into a global power.
As someone who lives in the springs it’s so weird to think of it as once a smaller town 😅
Nannie Doss!!! Please talk about that crazy lady
People that go after married men/women are disgusting.  Get your own spouse. And if you’re married..fix your own relationship.  Keep your hands and other body parts away from spouses that are not yours. 😒😒😒😒
I must know- do you have extensions.  I ask because I NEED this hair so I either need some serious vitamins or extensions 🤣
kinda grosses me out watching these, i feel bad for the families she talks about :(
Jen & Ben Aka The original Bennifer 😱
Love to see you back! <3 Thank you for all your hard work on these videos. Did you skip the nail polish on your pinky on purpose?
Colorado springs is such a cute little town. I live near there and I visit my friends a lot of the time that have moved down there
I always have wondered if any of the people involved in these cases have reached out to you?
You're hair is super cute Bailey 😍
Ben n Jen at the gym keeps repeating in my head now 😅
BAILEY Ik you did not just say “slapping meats together” 😂😂😂😂
Definitely visit Colorado Springs! So gorgeous!!!! There’s “Garden of the Gods” which is a whole area of amazing rock formations. There’s Cave of the winds, Native American Cliff Dwellings, Pikes Peak which is the highest summit of the Southern Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Etc. It’s a gorgeous place to visit!!!
"Don't blame him, it's not always the the husband"  Is the husband 🤣😭😭🤣
Bailey : okay it not funny but…  Me      : 🤣🤣😶😅
nice video!
Hey shoutout from Colorado Springs! Love your videos Bailey!
Those butterfly clips… oh the nostalgia
She was a store on deadly women they made it sound like the victims husband was pounding scripture at her so he could say it was all her idea.
The intro song was extra spicy today~
Have you ever done a M,M & M story in Portland, Oregon? I don’t think you have. Can you do one for me? That would be awesome of you!   P. S. I love you so much!! 🤗
What's up with all the rhyming couple names in this case xD jen and ben, dianne and brian :v
Bailey straight up skipped “Bumping Uglies” and went right to SLAPPING MEATS 😂😂😂😂
My sister lives in Colorado Springs & I always have to remind her that everything bad happens in Colorado 😂
I can't believe he did that to his own children. Such a disgusting thing to take their mother away from them. I hope they have found peace and grew up loved.
Bailey, this reminds me of a story inTexas and Wyoming. This guy manipulated his gf into kidnapping these old people and stealing their camper. They were arrested and her sentence was just excommunicated this last month
Bailey is craxy and I love it  she give only child vibes
Hey Bailey! Question— are ALL your episodes YouTube? I’m an avid watcher and have watched all the YouTube many times but occasionally I see some on Facebook that I don’t recognize from your YouTube channel. Am I crazy? Or are some not posted on there. Lol! Thanks and also- have a GREAT day!!
The way I am grateful I found this channel 😭❤️❤️
I think they are both equally accountable and his smiling mug shot? Gross.  Idea: Denise Pflum from Connersville,  Indiana.  Went missing in 1986. As much as we hate unsolved cases though....I don't think this one has been officially solved. 🥺
Also look how old 28 looked back then😳
I love your stories, but that annoying high pitch sir da sir, sir da sir thing you do, not so much! It grates on my nerves!
Yay I'm so glad Bailey is back! I absolutely love her personality and the way she tells stories makes it feel like she's talking to a friend.
11:20–11:30 OMUGAWWWD🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂🤣
hi Bailey I hope that you see this but I just wanted to let you know that you’re amazing for showing us everything that you know and as somebody who didn’t have a person to show her how to do this you made me confident to try and learn at almost 30 years old so thank you for all you do we appreciate you ♥️
Can you do the Wesson “family” massacre? It’s crazy creepy.
Bailey seriously tho how many tries did it take you say slappin meats together without snort laughing 😂
90's throwback clips hayyyyy
Got a case for u Bailey "The Ruinerwold children"
Happy New Year! Great story. You look gorgeous, as usual.
Can you do the story on the Alex Murdaugh family from Hampton SC?
Jennifer's mugshot is super creepy with that huge smile on her face 😬 Edit: Brian's smile is even creepier 😒
✨peace maker✨
You’re probably too young to remember Bob Crane from the series Hogans Heroes. It’s been a long time mystery and I would love to hear your rendition of that story.
So happy you are with us in this New Year! Thank you so much! I also want to say, I just got my holiday gift from my son today and it is the Suspish sweatshirt--it is glorious and I love it!
slapping meats together HHAHAHAHAH love that
The beginning of this video was really amazing since Bailey noticed that sometime we make unfounded comments about people's relationships and thoughts. Especially in comment section -- most don't do research and spread like fact. We know at least half the time its built off assumptions. One of my family friends died, and there's a very popular video on her death by another account that completely depicts the relationship she had with her husband wrong, and made her look bad despite being an innocent victim! I don't think Bailey has done this. but it is messed up the other channel did it. So much misinformation around and no one double checking
I love how Bailey apologizes to us about lying about when she films & her background 😂😭 we love you Bailey we don’t care when you film we are just happy you film and upload your videos 💕❤️
april tinsley
Do we really think the mother of the guy Jennifer cheated on is going to be an impartial character witness???
Ayo
PLEASSEEEES DO DENIS RADER
Ben prob gave Jen that specific gun… bc he didn’t trust her (rocky relationship) and new it would be easily traced!!
Do Charlie McCarthy  pleaseeee
Do Charlie McCarthy
Check the case covered in the book Say of Love Satan by David St. Clair
Do Charlie McCarthy please!!!
I wonder if the brother was involved because he was like “no, Brian didn’t do it”
You def gave it away right In the beginning that the husband was behind it 😩 soiled.
Why they are smiling in their mug shot. Crazy
While I'm not a fan of makeup at all, I have to say Bailey tells these stories so much better than any documentary out there does... that alone made me subscribe
As friends in the jacuzzi!!
I love the extended version of the @Theme song” 🤣
First video I'm watching - it would be awesome, considering your platform size, if you could donate to some of the families or programs relating to helping victims of true crime stories that you speak of. I think it's fine and dandy to speak about dark stories, but maybe consider a way you can bring an actual positive impact relating to the topics you bring to light.
What shadow are you using in this video?!
Would you ever talk about Madeleine Mccan? I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this case!
Bailey I definitely want to hear you talk about the Wesson family massacre. I heard about it recently and boy oh boy….. it’s… disturbing to say the least
Colorado springs is really cute, you should def visit sometime!
Stunning makeup 💄 but gosh tragic story and i don’t like that they both didn’t get life ugh the justice system!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I think they should have been treated a bit more equally. Maybe life on her and 25 on him
Could you do Dennis Nilsen?
Can we please have merch that says "it's not funny but..." and "I'm laughing because..."
Can we get a hair tutorial ?!!
Look into Knutby, it's a swedish cult
PLEASE DO A DARK HISTORY EPISODE ON FEMALE CIRCUMCISION !!!
NO FRICKEN WAY IM FROM THEIR COLLEGE TOWN
Been here since day one. Love you so much, Bailey ❤️
Welcome back. I missed you. DON'T EVER CHANGE YOUR THEME SONG!  Have you done Angela Simpson yet? That story sounds interesting.
I love her so much! Makes my heart smile!
Can you share the color of your lipstick and lip liner you use?
The fact that they were both smiling??? They should’ve both got life without parole
I watched Joe Kenda tell this story and now I'm watching Bailey. I like them both equally. They're great.
Thank you for the video!!!
Colt 45 also known as widow maker 🙏🏻👍
This is the way to start off the New Year! I love your storytelling ability, Bailey 💯
I moved to colorado last December and I did NOT realize how many true crime stories are connected to the springs/pueblo/denver corridor...
Please cover Andrea Knabel's case! Andrea is from Louisville, KY and she vanished in 2019.
Do Brian Laundrie and Gabby Petito story please.
Bailey. Do you really have all that hair? Do you wear extentions to make it fuller? It so full and glorious!
I knew it! Brian is somehow involved .. ergh! Love ur makeup btw 😍
Why are both of them laughing in the mug shot? Wth
When you finally start singing the theme song with Bailey. Hello from Japan!
You have to wonder what happened to the children. They are always the losers in a case like this.  PS: Happy New Year, sweetheart. The hair rocks.
No man with skin in that condition is worth doing a murser
It's a really terrible time to be a Jennifer huh!
this video is so last year
Please do the Wesson Family. It’s such a crazy story
Bailey! Can you please do an episode on the Lynette Dawson case!! She Went missing in the 80’s and 2 days later her husband’s girlfriend moved in oh and did I mention the girlfriend was a student from the school he taught at !!  Super suspicious!!
Her videos are like a gift 🎁🙊
They both should have got life, and that insurance money should have got into a trust for her kids only so he couldnt get a dime of it if it was awarded at all.
Colorado Springs is huge. Expennnnsive. It used to be a town. Nice "calm" town. *sigh*
❤
I love you babygirl!!
Hi Bailey, big fan. I wondering if you can do a case or two from South Africa, totally separate. The Oscar Pistorius or Nomia Ndlovu case.
He was having an affair, the mistress did it then.
Jennifer  was manipulated and brainwashed  by brian. .she was mentally abused  by her husband. and was very introverted... Brian was a pos.
"Slapping meats together" 😂 😂 💀 I'm dead!!!
I think that's the gun all the famous gunslingers used like  Wyatt earp and doc holliday.
I know this is random lol but I just love your name has such a beautiful ring to it. If you named your channel anything else it would just be like…why? 😕😂 it’s a born star’s name lol 😘
they working with the feds acting like there abusing you
Why was ep 2 of dark history taken down? I haven’t seen them all does anyone remember what that one was? Or know what happened?

SIDE NOTE: I can't possibly be the only one that hears "Son of Sam, son of Sam, son of Sa Sa Sa Sa Saaaaaaam" in the intro... it gives me the giggles every time *blushes*

i would love to see bailey do a mystery & makeup about the Turpin family
Could you do Luca Magnola?
If they thanked her for her cooperation in Bryan's trial, why didn't they give him a longer sentence.....
Your hair does look so cute Bailey!
Bailey was meant for these works of art....and I look forward to every story!
I MISSED YOUUUU🥲❤️❤️

He also goes by the unfortunate nickname of 'The Brown-out Strangler' and happened all the way back in 1942 and he killed 3 women!!! (Sickoooo- eww) The man wasn't Aussie himself but he was in Australia and he did time in Pentridge Prison!! Defs something to look into my love!!!  Love ya Bailey, hope you're doing well!! <3 <3
"slapping meats together" ahahaha 💀
That disgusting smile on his face screams ‘I got away with it’ 😬🙄🥴
Joe Kenda was the detective that solved this case he is amazing.
Can you talk about Albert Fish next please?
I live in Colorado so I was thinking that this guy is loose in my state!  So I did some googling and I did indeed find his Facebook page.  Nothing on it really but it’s definitely him, it says he lives in Denver and there is a cozy pic of him and a lady.   I sure hope she watches your channel!
Everytime you said my name threw me off 😂 such a sad story though.
Slapping meats 🥩😆💀
When she laughs and say “it’s not funny”
Bailey is EVERYTHING. How can you not watch her videos.
Slapping meats 😂😂
I wish i could go back to 2020 when i discovered you and rewatch all your videos for the first time again
Hi Bailey ! a fan here :) Can you please tell the story of Pedro Alonso López !? PLEASEEEEEEE
So beautiful, as always!  Love you girl.
Hey Bailey , can you pls talk about the Sylvia Likens case I just came across . I was quite baffled . Such a underrated case and gruesome, the stuff that happened to that poor girl!!!
do harold shipman pls
I love when she says, “Science!” in every story when fingerprints and dna is involved. Lol 😆
What happened to the kids though?
Does anyone what kind of makeup brushes she uses?
LOVE your hair!!!
Lynne speaking here I love true crime I have to go find this book now to add to my collection. Love your videos Bailey 😊
Not slapping meats 😭🤣🤭
That’s so awful bc like where did their three kids go ?
Listening while I’m doing my criminal justice homework 😄
As a person from Colorado Springs, the odds of anyone having an antique gun collection are pretty high😅
So sad I missed Monday!!
Bailey, Your hair looks fabulous. I like this color on you. Thanks for the video.
“Slapping meats together” is now the phrase I’m using for the rest of my life.
Do marcus wesson one.... it's so sad but I have so many questions
LUKA MAGNOTTA!!!!!!! BAILEY PLEASE
I just downloaded a book about AquaTofana. Can’t wait to get into it.
Not sis dying 3 months later 😂 Now if that is not Karma I don’t know what is. Karma always comes to collect her things 💅
It’s like being on FaceTime with your best friend while she’s spilling all the tea 🖤
ok Bailey.... your story pinup question:   YES, ABUSE OF POWER!  MORAL DEGRADATION WITH ILL , murderous intent.
I watch Bailey all the time, I be talking back like we're seriously talking about these stories. I love it hereeeeee
NOT slapping meats together!!! 😂😂 I flatlined.  Lol.
I love how she said r we reading Clue 😂 my theater class is doing a play for Clue😂
btw Bailey.... missed you over the holidays.  I hope yours were grand days of joy and peace.  Your sarcastic humor is maturing and awesome. ( love your super eye roll statements to help those not watching your face realize the sarcasm you are expressing)👍👍😳😌😂 ....  I appreciate you..   thx for all you do...  here's to a better, safer year in 2022.
Bailey as you should make a video on John List from Westfield, New Jersey. It’s a crazy story
Do a maura murray one!! 😍
you should do an episode on the wesson family massacre!!!
Bruh if you’ve ever watched joe kenda you know Colorado Springs is crazy
I never thought Colorado Springs would be in your videos!!
Bailey: Colorado Springs is a small town  Me from Colorado Springs: 🧐🧐🧐
Three minutes in…  Lupus is a crazy & confusing disease that is very hard to diagnose. The symptoms present differently in each patient & can cause extreme changes in mood. My uncle had a “temper problem” his whole life & then became very weepy after diagnosis & treatment. Singer Toni Braxton also has lupus & almost died while performing in Vegas. After not being able to meet her contractual obligations, the venue sued her for lack of performance ☹️ Anyway. Carry on….
I missed you so much! But this video was worth the wait, very refreshing. Thank you and welcome back!!!
u are one of those people that i would defend for literally anything 😂 ily ur perfect
I want you to do my makeup 😜PLEASE!! You’re so freaking adorable and talented!!  Thanks for doing what you do!! You make my day!! ❤️
Bailey can you please do the Dacera Case of the Philippines. It's a whole lot of f up. I think your Filipino audience would love it since it's all about Police Brutality, abuse of power and the worst things about the Philippine police and conspiracies  ...and this case may be recent yet finish
He's still in CO due to parole stipulations.
Bailey can u please look up Baby BRIANNA in las cruz new mexico who parent's n brother in law abused n killed AND PLUS BOTH SIDESIDE FAMILY DIDN'T WANT TO CLAIM THE BABY TO BEARY HER SO NEW MEXICO CLAIMED HER N PUT A STORY N PLUS A FENCE AROUND HER
Can you make a video about the silent lady mexican wrestler?
Anyone else want a set up tour of all the makeup?
5:07 killed me, your personality is the best thing
I get real doomsday couple level manipulation from this!
The Rapture is coming. What they tell you after is a lie. They’ll say we were abducted by aliens. Btw, those are not aliens, they’re demons. Read Revelation DONT TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST. ❤️
WB to the real world Bailey it's time to adult again! ughh lol
I think you should do a story on the “girl in the box”. I have just finished the movie and I think it would be very interesting if you put your own details into it. It is a true story. I think you should really consider it. Thank you
Born and raised in COS!!!!! There’s like a zillion people here now. Ok, back to the story. 🤓
Please do “HH Holmes” next
"What a weeno"😂😂
Hearing you talk about my hometown in the beginning of the video just warms my heart lol. ❤
Bailey saying “slapping meats” was a great way to start 2022 💀
Holy Moly! I went to school at ASU too. I was like WHAT🥴
You should tell the story of Susan Smith and Mark Putnam in Pike County, Kentucky. That's a crazy case. There was a film called "above suspicion" made about it.
Slapping meats …. My face —>😩
Appreciate the cute butterfly hair clips! Especially since it’s a 90’s case! Very clever, Miss Bailey! 🦋❤️
You’re trending. I can’t believe I found your channel a little over two years ago 😭😭😭 you deserve this so much ❤️
Please do anatoly moskvin
anatoly moskvin
Today's story takes place in *Colorado Springs* 😳 Rut-roh.  Edit: lol I should've known from the title that it happened in COS.
what nail polish do you use please? your red nails are so cute
It's beautiful there you should definitely go. I went there with my ex bf family to visit their son and his wife who live there.  They have a place called the garden of the gods very pretty I would recommend going
I promise you that Colorado Springs is not a charming or cute town.
I have some ideas billy the kid, Dlhilan Randall Mercado Gonzarlez and my home town El Paso, Texas David Marmolejo
Keep up the great videos 🖤✨ my mood always improves when I see you’ve uploaded
Girl I had to rewind because I've never seen our city be referenced in a story. I like in San Angelo tx where Angelo state university is at.....crazy lol
You should do a story on Emmett Till
Love the make up and hair! Maybe you can do the Betsy Faria/Pam Hupp case.
Every time I go on a true crime binge my hometown Colorado Springs is mentioned 😂 People are wild there I swear.
He looks like Kevin bacon!
Story Suggestion. Dorene Rauterman from Warrenton or Astoria Oregon  this was the missing person case that I remember from my childhood in the ‘80’s I remember because we share the same name and my parents wouldn’t let me forget what happened to her.
Bailey, pleeeeeasseee do the John McAffee the creator of the McAfee antivirus for computers
Tbh they both should have gotten the same sentence, I lowkey think Brian was more involved than we think.
Love Audrey in the background
I don't think she was manipulated into doing it, I think they came up with the plan together
I received my suspish merch today and I loooooooooove it!!!! 🖤🖤🖤
it’s a happy new year now
“I got miracles to do” 😂💀
I love hanging out with Bailey while I'm cooking dinner 💜💜 Does anyone else throw in a few words, out loud while listening to Bailey The Best Friend??
Can you have like one of those little markers on your videos of when the story begins? Just wondering 😍
Smd Fr😉
"We in clue?"🤣
Shout out to selena Gomez
Shout out to my mom who also has lupus!! Woohooo
Jennifer.. Jennifer lol it’s funny how she says her name in this story
1 shot from a piecemaker is all it would take if ya hit in the chest area
Your personality is so addicting! but i just want to say thank you for consistently putting out amazing content. I recently started a true crime channel and realized how much hard work it takes, Thank you!
Please do the Erica Parsons story!
Brian’s theology is a little off….
Bailey you’re so pretty without makeup! Yes you’re talented and artistic. But great face all by itself. 👍🏼
both of them should of equally been punished tbh
Bailey could you please do a show on Dr. Death aka Christopher duntsch
Gj getting 6m
you should do a video on the West Memphis Three. i’m extremely interested on your opinion on this
Lol I'm here just for your victory shriek
"I got miracles to do" 😂
It’s interesting how religion can become a weapon if it ends up in wrong hands. Worse than a gun because you can believe in messed up things plus convince others.
05:55 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love you Bailey!!!  I lived in Colorado Springs for a while so it’s so weird to hear of a case from there!! You should cover the story of Yara (from Italy, where I am from), they just made a movie abt it on Netflix as well!!
:) love your videos
This video is like a high school gossip click. 🤦‍♀️
If there were witnesses why didn’t they help her? I don’t understand, I would try to help or call 911.
Colorado Springs is full of right wing extremists.
ummmm...I live there
Poor woman was manipulated but she pulled the trigger sooooo
More like John Tobias and Ed boon
He planned his prison escape so planned his wife's death
I hope the intro never stops! Freaking love it!
Smacking meats together took me out😂😂😂😂
you must do a video about ROBERT HANSEN love you badly ^^ <3
Both are guilty of this... Pancreatic cancer isn't a joke. She suffered for sure.
"Lets hope that 2022 treats us right!" Bailey's face: 0:42
Best theme song yet
Did Lt. Joe Kenda work on this case? Please say yes!
Bailey you should do one on Kevin Buckland he is from WV and he killed his mother and frames a young child for it it's interesting he is out now and married to his cousin
Love these videos! I always feel like I’m at my best friend’s house listen to the best gossip as she does her makeup 😂  Btw its cute, it looks like you are wearing a tiara 👑
Slapping meats got me 😂  Make up flawless as always 💜
Why were they smiling in their mugshots lol
Why were they smiling in their mugshots lol
I'm at the point that you said Brian is out cause he doesn't match the description.  My theory: he had insurance policies on her (he sold it remember) and he hired a hit man. Now to continue watching
" the peace maker" was what Wyatt Earp s gun was named. Could it have actually been Wyatt Earp s gun?
As soon as i heard Colorado Springs I heard Joe Kenda
They definitely deserved the same sentence and she tried to set Ben up by asking for the gun and taking his clothing! And Brian looked way too happy in prison!!
How did you do your hair tho?? So dang cute
🙌🏻✨🖤
Dang! Makeup does miracles. Do us a favor and keep it on 24-7 😵‍💫😬
they were both smiling in the mug shots.... equal life
My gurl is #13 on trending 🥳🥳🥳 Way to go Superstar🌠
Is it bad I sing the theme song with her?  Like I know it's coming and wait paitently to do it 🤣🤣
brains mug shot was a jump scare
I just gotta point something out real quick... the fact that every time she chuckles or laughs when she's telling these stories and has to explain herself each time why she laughs, goes to show you that the negative comments and the opinions of the karen's have really got to her. No need to explain yourself why you laugh Bailey... we're all laughing at some point with you lol sorry it's just something I have noticed watching these videos and her mentioning one time that some people found it disrespectful how she chuckles or laughs sometimes... its ridiculous. Anyway... Proceed.
Sending some love from Colorado Springs, Colorado!!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 Missed you dearly 💕
Coffee shop had 5cents a cup and you keep your cup there in the shop. Walls were covered with cups. Colorado Springs was safe to walk around it during that time. But now it has become a scary place to live. I lived there for over 25 years.
The Army Base is Fort Carson in CO and there are actually 2 AF bases. I was there from 2014 to 2019. Miss that place. I advise anyone go visit. Soooo much to see, lots of trails to hike and run!!
"GASPerella," had me screaming 🤣💀 I love this woman!! 😂
I love that I can listen to your episodes while I'm working.  [Update] Really missing MMM episodes.  Hope they come back soon...
Ma'am 😭😭😭😭 you are forever a brightness in my day. I thank youuuuu!
When you said “oh thinking it will be the husband …” I replied (out loud to the video) “oh but nay nay!” 🥰😁 I heard this case on Kenda Homicide Detective. Two awesome people I listen to all the time!! X
Why are these idiots grinning in their mug shots???😅
My boyfriend’s face as I sing along to the intro song 😂😂😂😂 📣
Cover Juan Corona!
250k small town 🤣 I grew up in a town of 400. Not 400 thousand... 400 people. That's a small town.
Always love your videos! Ps can I request (or have you already done..) Henry Lee Lucas! X
A Sick mind going into religion is a very dangerous cocktail to drink.
girl we missed you
it says I'm back! Then you say imma take a break. I AM CONFUSION. P.s. Sloppin meats
Both of them should've gotten the same amount of time.
Could you do the Shawn gates story
Is this girl ditsy or what . Normal for today's standers . No , she's a deep and cheap Democrat lol I'll bet . Dems can't afford to much for wide spread manipulation . But it's the little things that count . Lol
Me as soon as you said Colorado Springs 👀👀👀 lol I live here 💀
You should do a video about the polygamy group that the kingstons run he's got like 27 wives and 300+ kids. I don't know much about the situation there but I watched that show called escaping polygamy with some his daughters that escaped and they help other girls escape from there too but just an idea!
Yo jcs name dropped you in a vid
Hi Bailey can you cover the Norma Lopez case in Moreno Valley ca. For next week? Love you🤗😄
So many mid rolls Jesus Christ
Me when I realized the theme song is from Paris & Nicole 🤯😱🤯
Watching this after Jennifer Lopez and Ben afflector back together is so pleasing when you say Jen and Ben 🤭😆💌
Hey Bailey can you discuss the Drew Peterson case?
I love how Bailey thinks we all talk like The Nanny lol 😆
I’m sorry but it’s a bit unsettling and disgusting that they are both basically laughing in their  mug shots  😡
HEY!!! She's back!!!! Yay!
Hey Bailey! Found your stuff some weeks ago, since that love your vids!  Where can I send you an nice suggestion from European cases?
YAY SHE'S BACK!! ❤
When I hear of stories like this... I wonder what happened to the kids. So horrible to lose their mom like that.  Maybe Diane's family felt they needed to side with/defend Brian because they didn't want the kids to lose both parents.
6 MILLION !!!!! GO BAILEY!!!!
Colorado springs is where Joe Kenda is from
@16:48 "what are thooooose? these are clotheeeeees"
I think they're equal partners in this and that they tried to throw each other under the bus when the truth came out. No way he's not involved that insurance policy was a big give away.
BAILLEEYYY!! Please talk about Eddie Lee Sexton! that right there is one of the most morbid cases i've ever heard of. he raised his family in a cult like manner,  married a few of his daughters and had children with THEM. i don't want to tell you too much but i really think this case is worth looking into.
Cover Arthur Labinjo-Hughes
Not me over here sipping my water nodding along with what Bailey is saying as if she’s talking straight to me 🤣
I live in Colorado Springs, have my whole life. My great grandma was actually one of the witnesses that heard Diane.
Colorado Springs being described as a cute and charming town 😂
Video recommendation -- Rodney Alcala!!  He was sentenced to death in CA for 5murders committed in the 70s and they found a whole cache of photos of potential other victims.
Bailey having an existential crisis 40 seconds is a MOOD!!!! 😂
He was just as responsible as if he pulled the trigger
Hi everyone! I would love to see Bailey put together a compilation of her different make up looks. Bailey, will ya?
Anyone else wish there where iron on Suspish logos. I'd love it on my jacket 😍
do you ever use the magnetic eyelashes, what are your thoughts on them
I don't believe that cancer is karma. Because it would seem that, that meant everyone who gets cancer is dealing with karma?
Great story - very cute make up and hair! ❤️ Love the winged eyes.
i know this is an extra disturbing one but can you please do a video on Tristyn Bailey? poor sweet girl.
“slapping meats” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do Israel Keyes!!
Can you do a celebrity makeup series?
Why...you...'lil...LIAR..! Ha...you couldn't even go through with it..."Bailey, the to be trusted," Queen.  Don't care when ya filmed girl...just glad yer back. N we gonna CRUSH 2022. Yep! Happy New Year!
Science 💫
You should do one of the west Memphis three !
Aloha Bailey!! 🤙 I just wanted to ask if you've done an episode on Robert Durst? I saw an article just now about him having passed away, and it made me wonder if you've covered him yet? 🤔 Thanks!! Ps. We totally love watching you!! You're such a fantastic story teller.
I just heard about the Piketown Massacre, apparently it was fairly recent! Wondered if that would be something you’d like to cover
Please do an episode on H.H. Holms. Thanks
Not you making a video that happened at Colorado Springs when I just moved here 🥴
I never comment but thank you for sharing these stories.
Stopped at 7:41 to guess it was a woman that did it. Just a guess, I may be wrong.
Our girls on the trending page! Woot woot
This is from my moms home town and my grandfather was a colonel in the air force gotta see if they knew any of them
you deserve so much more<3
6 MILLY BABYYYY
THE THEME SONG HAS ME DYING. I wasnt expecting the extention at the end xD I am so used to the original. Sana Saaa Sana SUHHH Sana SA SA Suna ..... SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.......AAA!
Point of wish to be an influencer if you are here once in month sometime once in two months 😂😂
Bailey you are so AWESOME 😁
I leaned about this story from Joe Kenda! I love him, I'm sure you all do too!
"WHAT IN THE TIME TRAVEL IS GOING ON?!"  bwahahahaha  I love you Bailey!  OK, now to continue... I had to pause and type that before my brain farts.
Love your hair 🦋
Why they both smiling in their mugshots though?
Who else says noggin with her?
Yeah this is a case from the case files of Lt Joe Kenda. Homicide hunter!!!!
What is with these two smiling in their mug shots. Wth
What is up with that mugshot?!
Very cool story but honestly I can't over how simple and flawless the look is... LOVE
No one: Bailey Sarian: jeniFFFEERR!!! 🤣
When you’re from Colorado and you hear Bailey describe Colorado Springs as charming and cute 😂
What extensions are your wearing? They’re literal perfection !!!
I felt I was dying while you were gone 🙂
Me sitting in Colorado springs rn listening intently 👂 👀
I haven't watched in a few months tha and I'm so excited the theme song and click is still in the intro
BAILEYYY PLSSSSS DO EMMETT TILL!!!!
I wonder what happened to brian’s children since the mother was gone now as well
Bailey: Brian was *heavily* involved in the church Me: uh oh
In reference to the gun, the Peacemaker was a single-action revolver. You need to manually pull back the hammer on a single-action revolver before firing. This also allowed people to "fan" which is holding down the trigger and continually pulling back on the hammer. This wasn't done often because it was incredibly inaccurate to do, it used up ammo super fast (you only have six shots), and it wasn't uncommon to accidentally get that piece of skin between your thumb and index finger caught, which would hurt like an MFer.   Modern handguns are dual-action, which means you don't pull back the hammer (despite them doing this in movies) as pulling the trigger does both actions for you. Some guns don't even have an external hammer (Glocks, for instance) yet you'll still hear that tell-tale "chk-chk" sound whenever someone raises and aims a gun in a movie. It's become a trope and it's incredibly inaccurate, but probably stems from westerns where manually cocking the hammer was needed if the film was trying to be at all realistic.   Then again, there are so many inaccurate ideas about firearms I wouldn't even know where to begin debunking them. Not all of these are from movies or TV shows either, but ideas people really believe in real life. For instance, a lot of people get all concerned when they hear the term "semi-automatic" and seem to equate that with "automatic." Not true. Semi-automatic is simply the ammunition cycling mechanism. In other words, every time you press the trigger, one shot fires. Virtually all handguns are like this.   You might ask, "But doesn't every gun do that when you pull the trigger?" Nope. There are numerous types of cycling mechanisms. Examples include muzzle loading, breech loading, lever-action, bolt-action, straight-pull action, pump action, and this doesn't even get into really old firearm mechanisms, like flintlocks, wheellocks, matchlocks, and caplocks. Certain terms sound scary, but they're really not and even if you're not interested in firearms, understanding the mechanics of how they work is fascinating.   I have tons of information about firearms, not because I am a "gun nut" but because I find the history of weapons (which goes way beyond firearms) and the science involved in inventing and making them work incredibly interesting.
Can you cover Nicholas Johnson and brindles Denison next from Oklahoma
Miss you Bailey! 💜
I wish my gym had a jacuzzi, maybe than I would actually go 🤣
Can you talk about Anatoly moskvin
Hi guys ... what does up for parol mean??
I was waiting for your videos so bad!!!!
Annjette Lyles...check it out
I don't think she was manipulated I think they planned it together. I hate how people act like women can't be just a awful as men.
I’ve missed you soooo much !!
Can you PLEASE do the EMMET TILL story
He should still be in prison!
the way you kept saying "Jennifer" made me feel like i was in trouble, and the one that committed the crime. 😬
Welcome back queen   Idk I’m torn in this one… she pulled the trigger so yeah, first degree! But we don’t have any actual proof of her side of the story…. So 🤷🏻‍♀️
Welcome back and Happy New Year! There's been a bunch of stories in the news lately about cold cases getting solved decades later. I'd like to hear your take on some of those this year.
Hawfany🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉👍
How tf did I forget you were back?!?!?!?!?
Please cover the case of Madeleine McCann 😬 one of the biggest mystery/ cover ups (imo) in the UK
*whispers* ~gasperella~   New lingo I will be incorporating into my everyday vocabulary
research the jennings 8
Colorado Springs is a fake tolerant town they don't accept anything but white and rich
It's my marriage anniversary n bailey came up with her new video..thanks girl..😘😘..made my day special 💗..
MAKE A MEMBERSHIP!!! PLEASE!
Boom Shakalaka 💥
Welcome back! Missed you Bailey. Happy 2022. ❤️
Everytime I hear Bailey saying these psychotic murderers got out from prison. I always hope they don't come after her for making fun of them. 😂 But Bailey girl! your story telling is 💯 interesting. Be safe out there. Please opt for the highest security you can get.
Baileyyyy PLEASEEEE DO THE MENEDEZ BROTHERS 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Your hair looks so cute!
Me: 1990, oh it's recent! ...1990 was 32 years ago...
Dr. Phil "In cold blood" aired October 18th 2021.
Love you, will you pllleeeease re-release the “nay nay I say” shirts I want one so bad
Can you do one on Anatoly Moskvin please 🙏🏻
They are both equally guilty imo
A video about Mary Bell the 11 year old who 2 boys would be interesting to hear!
I am so glad you are back missed your video’s 🥰
Butterfly clips!!!!!!!
Your amazing! I am not sure if you’ve done him or not but can you do a video on Anatoly Moskvin.  He is from Russia and he turned his victims into porcelain dolls.
Hi Bailey! Just wanted to recommend a podcast I just finished called Bad Women. It's about the victims of Jack the ripper in 1880's London and the host is a historian that takes a lot of time to dive into the lives of these women and reclaim the narrative that they were just "bad women" that had it coming. I really loved it for this reason, it was very humanizing and heart wrenching to hear about why women in the Victorian period had so few choices for their lives and how poverty affects violent crime and how it gets investigated and justified.
I missed you bb
How freaky would it be if Brian commented on the video? Oh dear lawd
May I just say Jennifer is so pretty
When she's doing her blush and is like "how can you be so DUMB?!".... that's how I do my maybe everyday 🤣

Your theme song should be on iTunes so when a person buys it and sets it up in their phone and when someone calls they’ll hear your theme song. Love you Bailey! ❤️ Also, my prayers are with Diane’s family 🙏🏻 💐
You are so beautiful and I love you ❤️ but I miss your dramatic eye looks from the past
Thankyou Bailey i always enjoy your intro 🤪🤪🤪🤪.
Colorado Springs has a high homicide rate. Check out Homicide Hunter with Joe Kenda. If you go there be careful.
small town 😂 my town's population is just under 700 people. I couldn't imagine 250k people in one area.
Please do a story on Susan Powell or Elizabeth smart!!
Yay she's back ☺️
Slapping meats 🤪🤣🤣🤣
I’m newer to Baileys channel, but her intro song is 100% from The Simple Life, right?!  “Sanasaa, sanasa”
Please cover de Rose and Fred west case
Bailey can you talk about Adrian Reynolds from the quad cities in moline, illinois. I was born and raised here and it’s a very shocking story! May she rest peace ✨
Just so you know, this video does not come up when searching for it on devices where I’m not logged in my YouTube account. Is that on purpose? I was trying to watch it on a pc, but it’s not visible when searching and also not visible when going into your channel.
slapping meats lol
So glad your back (have been watching dark history love them) great story "It's not the husband "🤔
I fully believe a person's mugshots tell their story. Both of them were smiling. 🙄
Woohoo hi Bailey! I love watching your videos while I eat breakfast in the morning☺️
A white Cis man in a position of power over a woman could never manipulate her🙄
If your last name is Hood would you name your child Robin?
Do a story on Mary Winkler!
dude you are so pretty it's crazy your face is so symmetrical and I have never seen someone so perfect at putting makeup on.  if you do not do that as your job or career you should lots of luv 💞. I watch your channel more then the others Stephanie Harlowe has gotten to serious about things and to opinionated. the others are to bland.
It’s funny you’d talk about the Peacemaker when John Cena has a new show coming out tomorrow where he plays a superhero called The Peacemaker 😂
Can you pls talk about the’ menendez brothers’ case?
Take a look into Mason Jenkins. It’s an interesting one. He killed his sister and his parents still fully support him.
Sick definition of Christianity. ☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹
Don’t bother visiting Colorado Springs. It is so conservative, I felt extremely off-put. It is also the home of Focus on the Family if that tells you anything about the general population.
I love Bailey brush phones
I’ve missed you so much!!!
YOU HIT 6 million subscribers! ❤️
It's not at all a cute little town and the population is much higher than she lets on. From there and spend every Friday back there. I'm not sure at all where she's getting this info but okay
I was born in Colorado Springs in 1991.
You look amazing, love your eyeliner 😍
You should cover the teagan lane case it’s interesting
Homicide hunter..   BAILEY  Please look into the 3 deaths of Marisol Escobedo
I freakin love you 🤗 you make my day every time!!
I’m so excited break is over!
I think you need to do the Shara Sherer case. It's awful.
Not sure if you have done this, but you should look into Robert pickton of British Columbia!
Is the same girl that used to date Bryce Hall?
If he wants his current wife dead, what makes you think he won’t do the same to you in the future?
Tricked or not, i dont really care. She was an adult and therefore responsible for her own decisions. The husband though... he shouldve spent more time in prison. Life insurance plan says it all. If he sees this wife as expendable, who says the next girl wont be too?
Great video! But I’m super obsessed w/ this makeup look and btw you’re seriously funny 😂🤗💗🦄
I think they both, Jennifer & Brian, should’ve at least gotten life in prison. I mean really?!?! I wonder how Diane’s kid’s feel about their punishment & how little time they served & that they are both out now, and I don’t frickin care that Jennifer is “gone”, bc I think it is karma. I just really feel bad for Diane’s kid’s.
Have you heard of the Chinese Jack the Ripper?  Gao Chengyong would be a really interesting one. I’d love to hear your take on it!!  And it’s fairly recent too! Crazy story. Keep ‘em coming!
"Slapping meats together" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"What in the time travel is going on"?! 😂
Is this Wyatt Earps gun peacemaker?
As a Jennifer, I love hearing you say my name 🤣🤣
The gun in Wynonna Earp is also called peacemaker. It's the same type of gun. I believe it's also the gun used in Peacemaker (the superhero show with John Cena). I believe it gained popularity as "the gun that won the West".
Did you get more color in your tats or have i just been watching old videos
Baily is so pretty
YOU ROCK! So smart of you to film before you went on vacation! I fella on the honesty, I’d have to confess, too. 😆 I hope you’re having a fabulous vacation 🥳
You should do Robert berdella. He was an awful awful man
Can u do a story on willie pickton !!! Plzzz !!!
I watch a lot of investigation discovery and have heard this story I think on Homicide Hunter. I love when Bailey tackles these stories because we get so much more detailed information  Edit: and Jennifer was on an episode of Deadly Women in 2010
Please do a video on miriam rodriguez. Her story was the real life “Taken”. ❤️
Both guilty
Lupus description well put. Direct and to the point. I appreciate you!!
I missed you so much happy new year Bailey ❗️❗️
Welcome back Bailey i missed you sm! 💕  I would love to see you tell the story of the Menéndez brothers or the house of horror next   I love you! ❤️
Girl! Check out ANTHONY SOWELL. Known as “The Cleveland strangler”! From 2009!!!!
I can not tell you how much I love these videos! Bailey is the best!
Why did Jennifer smile at her mugshot??
They both should have had life in prison.
He did not age well. Yuck.
The creepy thing is is that he might be watching this video right now… eeeek!
I don't think Jennifer was manipulated at all. I think they both planned it but the victim's husband probably came up with the idea.
Ahahhah you are life bailey
I missed youuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!
Just wanted to say that my Grandma came in while I was watching this and asked who this beautiful girl was ❤️
She needs to do a Joachim Kroll.
I know it's been done, but I'd love to here your take on New Orleans's Madame La Laurie
Ugh, that Brian dude such a joke….makes true Christians look suspish to everyone else.  Gag, how disgusting.
“What a F-ing winner 😂😂😂😂
Nice work - interesting case
Mm we can hope 🥲😆
Hi Bailey 🙂 I was just wondering.... Do you or have you ever used those Magnetic lashes? I'd love your input! ❤️ Thankyou ;)
You really do make my day whenever I watch you. You make me laugh even when talking about tragedy. Keep it up Ms. Sarian 💙
story starts at 1:45
Been here for a while I love watching Mondays and Thursdays. Had the flu so I'm little late but what great pick me up.
SLAPPING MEATS
Random I know, but does anyone know the nail colour she's wearing? I love it !
6.01 mil subs?!?!?   Amaze! 🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️
TRENDING AT #5!!! 🤩
Can you make some merch that says “SANASHAAA”
Baileyyyyyyyyyy you are the best 🙌🏽 please cover the Ashley Lyons story from my hometown Georgetown Kentucky. Her story has been featured on ID channel before but I would love to hear you tell her story. She was a friend of mine and I love getting her story out there since a law was passed in her and her sons honor. Thanks and keep doing what you do 😘 Byeeeeeee
I absolutely *hate* it when evil people justify their actions with religion.  It makes me sick to my stomach.
Can you do alyssa bustamante next??? Really crazy case she's 15 and committed an unusually violent crime for someone her age
100% should've been given the same sentence. He ahould not of gotten out early. I think she was manupulated some..but she still killed someone and she knew what she was doing. So she should've served life. Which in the end she basically did..only having 3 months out before she died
“What in the time travel is going on right now? Are we in clue?” 😂😂😂
Criminals are rarely ever intelligent.
I live in Colorado Springs now, it's a pretty big city...
Bailey, think it's a bit unfair that you said Jennifer probably didn't deserve to be in prison then said that the husband did for his involvement and taking out the insurance. While I agree he definitely deserved a harsher sentence, she should have been in for life for actually pulling the trigger. Even if he did manipulate her, you don't shoot somebody unless you really want to.
Have you heard of the case of Molly Young?? We’d love for you to do a piece on it! I’m part of a Facebook group that has been trying to bring justice for her. Love your videos and have loved watching your channel grow!! Please look into MOLLY YOUNG, she deserves justice🖤
benifferrr
6m go Bailey yess girl 😍💞
Okay why are they all smiling and laughing in all their mug shots though?
I always look forward to these videos
Found you after JCS mention you. Love what you're doing. Keep keepin'on! Much love and respect from the UK
Lol peacemaker for it makes peace by putting ppl in dirt. Pretty sure its a colt.
First off welcome back lovely<3 Honestly, in my opinion..if she didn’t want to do it she wouldn’t have. He didn’t stand there holding a gun to her head. She didn’t have to kill her. I believe that a heavier sentencing would have been warranted considering. That is however just my opinion, feel free to share yours:)
Can you do the Jessica ridgeway case I don’t see a lot of videos done on that one
Happy new year
Hey Bailey, such a huge fan!  Could you cover the Sebastian Burns/Atif Rafay case cuz it is DODGY AF! The Canadian and Seattle police have A LOT to answer for. I don't believe these lads did the crime they're convicted of.
Anyone know what Baileys middle name is?
I actually just watched this on homicide hunter i think
Like your storys . I have a peacemaker
I'm not sure if you've done this one before but, the McDonnell's mass shooting in 1984. The shooter was Huberty. Took 77 minutes to take him down. He left many dead and wounded.
I had guessed this right away from Homicide Hunter. It was a case that Joe Kenda solved
I’d love to hear you talk about the 2017 Kenneka Jenkins case, even though her death was presumed to be an accident. Such a weird, sad story, with lots of unexplained questions. Such a big fan of your incredible work!! ❤️
New merch idea…. T-shirt with ‘hmm… interesting 🤔’ on it 😂
Bailey i havent gotten to listen to you in so long because of school and the theme song just rejuvenated my life I love your videos 💜💜
I absolutely adore Bailey’s personality
Bailey: JENNIFERRRRR me, a Jennifer who has done nothing: IM SORRY.
Bailey pleaaaase can you do a video on Israel Keyes 🙏🏽   Thank you 😊❤️
"Slapping meats together"😭😂
Yes , ha I fly out to Colorado Springs on Thursday morning 🤣 this is perfect . Had no clue when I clicked on it. I even thought about waiting to watch till I got there. Sort of glad I didn’t tho. I’d freak myself 😳😳😳
Welcome back!
I don’t think anything makes me more disgusted than people smiling in their mug shots.
Dude! I just realized she’s our modern day Tales from the Crypt! Love it!
Jesus is coming back to save his people repent before it's too late!!!81%of biblical prophesies have been fulfilled leaving only 19%
You should do a video on Laurie Bembenek. It's a crazy story.
CONGRATULATIONS ON 6MILLION BAILEY! ❤️
⚠️Don’t read comments before watching whole video ⚠️
What have I learnt from watching Bailey's videos: 1. Never move to Colorado.  2. Never marry anyone named Chris.  3. Never makes friends with anyone named Nicole.  4. They're never 'just friends'.
“Slappin’ meats…”  :: falls off his bed howling with laughter! ::  With all that meat slapping, you’d think they had a nice salami sammich! 🤣 Maybe some eggplant 🍆 !
I live there 🥲🥲
She was charged the day I was born lol 9/14/90
30:47 I think the prison realized at some point that she was going to die in prison and they didn’t want the backlash or lawsuits against them for it because they do have to provide basic medical checks but I’m sure they waited too long for professional help and when reviewing liability I’m sure they thought it was easier to just let her go
Can you do one about Fred and rose west in the future please
“Let’s get an update. Brian, come on it!” Took me OUT 💀💀💀
#5 on trending. we love you and are so proud of you bailey!
You are 11 trending girl 😍🤗🔥
the way i freaked out when she mentioned asu cause that’s where i go-
Love your beautiful makeup look I always look forward to hearing your theme song it's so funny  I just live you been a huge fan for years now can you talk about the Jon Benet Ramsey case next please
Bailey can you do an episode on Shawn Grate, I don't believe you've done one on him before
Hi Bailey! Could you please do an update to the jj and Tyler vallee case! Would love to know where that went! Happy New year! X
Can you please do Nevada-Tan
ha literal smoking gun
I would love to hear your take on Amelia Dyer. She was all kinds of crazy.
Dude why is Bailey sarian my spirit animal. Her videos are what keeps me going everyday
Hahah dude so crazy my hometown is where Angelo state university is at!
Peace Maker as in Wyatt Earp’s gun??? From tombstone?
Always a pleasure to see your face. Hey Lady I remember a while back you mentioned that you are part Armenian. My son is playing professional Basketball overseas in Armenia. I told him Bailey is part Armenian. He said WHO ????? So I had to say you know the Makeup Lady that I binge watch. LOL he knew then who I was talking about. LOVE YA ....
Thank you Bailey for more amazing content. Your cases and your looks are always amazing, not to mention how hilarious you are.  The intro song was especially fabulous this time as well.
#5 on trending boo❤️❤️
The butterfly clips are *life*
Yeah after Betty white, then bob saget, idk how this year is gonna turn out
6mil babyyy 🥳🎉 and number 5 trending!!
Nice to see you back Bailey! May i request a story from the Philippines? Check out The Vizconde Massacres.
Oh please do a piece on Robert Pickton!! This story is insane!?!
Am I the only one who think they had lil to no evidence on Brian?? Free him.
What eyeshadow shades are you using from the brunette palette in this vid
“Lemme think” “no.”
I love your lipstick!
I think they should have equal sentence's
Cringe
The gun would’ve blown her body to shreds . That’s such a high power gun.
I thought they go to Baguio Philippines as friends 😅
Please Please PLEASE can you do the story of  Stewart and Cyril Marcus! A movie was made about them called Dead Ringers. I absolutely adore and LOVE your videos/channel.
Do one on the Las Vegas shooter
i love u bailey
Carl Panzram could be an interesting one. 😊
Dose Anyone notice that bailey always saids excape insteade of escape 😂
Bailey you should do a video on Billy Milligan
I’ve missed you! Love dark history but it’s just not the same ❤️
I am so happy to see you back!!!!!!
Love having you back after a well deserved break
Joe and Mickey Bryan - awesome crime story
You should cover Alexander Bean and his cannibal family!  (The family wrong turn was based off of.)
Ok, so have you read on the Ant Hill Kids!?
Just love the way you narrate ❤️
So I'm from a small town, 1800. And when we hear small town 250,000 it shocks us lol.
I live in Colorado springs and would die if you came out here😫
Hey bailey! Have you done a story on richard cottingham yet? Something wack is going on with the daughter of one of his victims too!
Please cover the darlie routier case because it is one of the most alluring cases I have ever researched and nobody talks about it !!!!
Could you talk about robert Thompson & Jon Venables documentary
This was on the homicide hunter by Joe kenda
Is it the wife. I’ve only seen less than 1/2 of the story.
They both deserved the "whole enchilada".  They both planned it but the lady probably was stuck with the details which she didnt do well.  The guy probably did not want to "know" any details so he would have "plausible deniability", that makes complete sense .
I honestly thought when there was the army fatigues and antique gun belonging to Ben, part of the plan was to frame Ben for Diane's death. Crazy story.
You know what else Colorado Springs is home to? JOE KENDA!!!! HOMICIDE HUNTER! Lol anyone else think that when she said Colorado Springs?
I wonder if there's an episode of Homicide Hunter on this. see if Joe Kenda worked on that case.
We all like your assumption better lol 😂
Hi from Colorado Springs! 😂
West Memphis Three next pleeeease 🙏🏼
I don'y know why, but this is my absolute favorite look! The subtle eyeliner pop of color, and the depth of the simple brown eyeshadow.
I’m sorry, do they still make butterfly clips??? I could never figure out how to wear them as a kid. I miss those spikey headbands, do you know what I mean? They were circular and stretchy, but made of plastic and they had “teeth” so when you pulled them back over your head they would comb through your hair and it looked so cool.
Happy you're back!! Congratulations on 6 million!!
Oh my, I grew up close to Colorado Springs, in Divide/Woodland Park  (higher up and smaller). There are lots of crazy stories! You should look up “The Texas Seven” they were found in Woodland Park, I was little, but I still remember the day they were caught. It was crazy, my mom remembers seeing them around town before they were caught. Creepy!
Look up Robert Hanson of Anchorage Alaska.
look at that carnivorous plant  lets name it Audrey 22 or Audrey jr jr!!!
Is any going to talk about the mug shot of her smiling
Have you thought about doing an episode on Samuel Little? I just recently heard about him with his drawings of victims recirculating last month. It seems like a wild story!
Hey girl, idk if you should be promoting wicked clothes anymore😭  I placed a big order and have yet to hear from them… took my money but nothing after that. Tons of other u happy customers on their instagram… i only ordered because i trusted you:(
Do a video on the Gainesville ripped! He inspired the scream movies!
You're taking up way much of YouTube's time. Learn listen....
So cute girl your hair! I love it 😍
i just shat myself im listening to this and im going thru pintrest and i hear "in Colorado springs" I AM SITTING IN CO SPRIMGS RIGHT NOW
can you do the case of Samantha Koenig pls
I love you! Ahh 😍
Cry laughing over here 😂 from where I come from in Colorado, Springs is like the big city before you get to Denver. Talk about being out in the sticks
“ARE WE IN CLUE 🕵️‍♀️ ☠️😂”
“Little weird to say after you just got done slapping meats together” LOVE YOU BAILEY I am stealing that
You said “Slapping Meats together “! 😂😂😂😂
Your trending queen!
Hey I live in Angelo!
Would u consider doing more paranormal stories like hinsdale house ? Or for mmm you could do more solved cold cases !
Because I watch a ton of “Based on True Stories” and always want to share in case you haven’t heard of them; Diana Donahue (Too Close to Home on Amazon Prime) and Bonnie Gilbert (Deadly Vows) these are just two that I have watched since I got home from work tonight and incredible stories 💚Love Ya
I’ve missed these 😭 thank youuuu
Ryan Family Masacre in Chino Hills, Ca!!!!!!
Did he really smile like that for his mug shot ?!!?! How infuriating
Would love to see her do a video on Gabriel Fernandez
Is YouTube really going  to censor true crime?   Other channels are having videos removed.  Are they after Bailey too?
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤ ✝️
One of the other parts that was not mentioned about this case was how the shooter held the purse/bag before firing the second shot. The shooter held the bag under their arm with the strap over their shoulder. this is typically how a women would hold their purse. This also lead them to believe it wasn't a male but a women who shot the victim.
Do a MMM on Robert Durst please!!!!
Imagine Brian watching this video and he’s like I’ma show up🤣
I want a Nay-Nay shirt!
There’s a homicide hunter episode about Dianne hood it’s in season 2 episode 1 it’s pretty much very similar to what she says
I love your videos. Next week I think you should do the story on Emmett Till or George Stinney
Video suggestion: susan and michael bear carson
Why is he laughing in his mugshot
Lots of love from Nepal 🙏❣️❤️🇳🇵🇳🇵
I met Jennifer in prison and I can assure you that she was completely manipulative, easily manipulated, and psychotic when it came to her partner! I have zero doubt that she would have repeated her actions. Once she was infatuated with someone, there was no stopping her!
You were some kinda extra weird today, loved every second of it!
We need a hair tutorial from you!! I love the volume you have and I need to know how you do it!! Please 🤗
my town has 21,760… tiny town?
hmm? THE WELCH GIRLS from Welch, Oklahoma
Ugh needed u woman haha
You should do luka magnota from Canada, scared me shitless as a teenager. I’m an hour away from it and when I would walk to school I would like be scared he was following me when he was on the run!!! Silly me
Someone got paid to do it.
Your the best! I love your spirit! And I can't leave out hilarious!😂😂🤭
Just really wanna know what lashes these are
haha I have that same shirt! love it sm
I gotta say it was surprising for me to hear my university’s name, was instantly like oh f*ck!
Do you ever worry about doing videos on people who are currently not in prison?
I LOVE your side comments "what in the time travel... what are we in clue?" 🤣🤣🤣
please do a story about Jennifer Pan next! 🙈
Hey I need a gun for protection……( hands over the slowest gun possible) 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gasperella is my new fav
Them clips giving me 90 vibes affff
ELEVEN ADS in a half hour long video?!  Sometimes I forget why I stopped watching. And then 2:03 into the video I remember.  🙄  Sold out so hard.
Yay you're back. I had to listen to another woman true crime YouTube. She's very new. And she's great but is a lot more serious so I can only take so much. I love that you lighten it more.
is it bad that I missed the theme song so I had to go back and listen to it?
Yaaay you came back early! Makes my whole week. Hey, I don’t think you’ve covered Bruce Lisker. I just binged the show “Interrogation” which is based on Lisker. Fascinating story. I want to hear the real story now from Bailey!
Not Bailey mentioning my college 🧐🥸
You should cover the case about the two 10 year olds  John venables and Robert Thompson
Happy New Year 🎈 Blessings Bailey! Love your channel!
Do a MMM on Dianne Zamora! Snapped made an episode on her
bringing back the butterfly clips 😍
Welcome baaaack!!
A orange-browny blush would have look better on you. Your eyes are orange and blue but your cheek are so peachy   Blue and Orange are two mismerinsing color together 💙🧡💙🧡
Hey! I’ve always loved the subtitles on your videos because they show up sentence by sentence, but this upload shows them as word by word which usually puts me off as it’s harder to follow! Most YT seem to be word by word and I really struggle with it so I was hoping yours would stay sentence by sentence 😔 fingers crossed it’s just this video and your subtitles revert to their usual format next week x
HII
So in conclusion it’s STILL always the spouse 💀
You gotta do a video on Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky, crazy manhunt that I remember being HEAVILY invested in. Now it’s kinda hard to find after the Pettito case.
Could you do a video about the JonBenét Ramsey case I remember that being in so many newspapers and magazines when I was growing up.
If you ever go to Colorado Springs. I would definitely recommend going to have a drink at Shame & Regret. The entrance is in the alley. It’s amazing!!
Haha I'm a CS native I remember this story!!
I love You
Why do Jen and Bailey favor tho?? Like possible relatives lol
Betty White died :(
"Gasperella" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brian may have took out the life insurance policy due to her being diagnosed with a deadly disease, definitely possible
Bailey!!!! Thank you so much for all of these videos! I'm in my 40"s and have ALWAYS failed at makeup. I was never taught how to apply makeup even though I love it. Because of you, I'm now fabulous! I started watching your videos for the makeup and have stayed for your stories. Much love!!!
Congrats Bailey on hitting 6 Mil ❤
It's  called a peacemaker  because it became popular with lawmen, ranchers, & outlaws in that era.
#4 on trending 🥳

Great video,  and  Thank you 😊  Love this makeup, girl! 👍👍👍👍👍
You should do an episode on dr death !!
realizing you missed bailey so much and you can’t stop yourself from watching this new episode over and over again >>>>>>
Do Andrea Knabel’s case!!! Please! She went missing Aug. 13, 2019 and hasn’t been seen or heard from since.
Please cover the missing person case of Andrea Knabel! She has been missing since August 13, 2019 from Louisville, KY. Please reach out to her sister Erin Knabel.
Bailey I always love that nail color. Where can I buy that polish?
I would like to hear about The Jinx.
bailey you should do a video about The Cecil Hotel
Poor kids 😔
Please talk about Andrea Knabel 37 year old went missing from Louisville Ky in 2019. Please we need your help.
#4 on trending when I’m watching this 🥺 happy for you
Please cover the Andrea Knabel case! She is a missing mother of 2 and used to volunteer with a missing person’s group before she went missing.
Isn't the Peacemaker the same gun Wyatt Earp used??
hey Bailey! hope you had an amazing christmas and new year!! I actually have a suggestion i’d love to hear you talk about. Randy Stair. I love you channel so much and can’t wait for your next upload! Thank you!!
Hair tutorial pleaaaaaaaase Bailey! Please please pleaseeeee. Your hair always looks so great. Especially when you do dark history episodes!  I know I’m not the only one who wants a tutorial!!
This look was everything todaaaaaayyy!!
I wonder if Joe kenda was working this investigation 🤔
Wooo! #4 on trending! Congrats Bailey! 🤍
Apparently it was called the Peacemaker because it could fire multiple times ensuring Peace because the gun could be used by smaller men or Women ensuring peace is kept in a community and not over run by big bullys basically
Bailey, please, please, PLEASE do the disappearance of Andrea Knabel!!!! Her family and followers of the case have been dying to get you to cover it!!!!
I just watched the episode with Detective Joe Kenda on this case !!
Do Blair Witch
Yayyyy Bailey’s back!! We missed you so much!! Welcome back babes ❤️❤️
Dude....I live in CSprings. Not a small town 🤣🤣🤣 I'm so sad how you described our town.
Aaaaw!!!!  She mentioned the AF Academy!!!!!  My dad went there and no one mentions it for some reason
Hey Bailey, nice to have you back! ❤ missed you! Can you please please talk about "Randy Stair" Love you!
I think "The Peacemaker" was the name of Wyatt Earp's pistol.
MMM Story Suggestion: Hailey Dunn case. They recently made an arrest after ten years.
#4 on trending ☺️☺️❤️❤️❤️❤️
My ex boyfriend said he was a prophet, told me he cheated on me (with the 14 YO he babysat) because he HAD to give her a bible & proposed to me then said we couldn’t get married bc his Grandma had a vision he was walking down the aisle with a blonde…I’m a redhead. So he took my ring. Back to Walmart. 🙃 wish I was kidding… 🥴
I think both of them should have got life. They both plotted to take out another human being. Karma sounds like she did pay a visit though.
istg we have the Same exact personality
Forever using the term “slapping meats together” 😂
Is a population of 250 thousand people a SMALL TOWN in America? I grew up in a small town that was actually a city. With 8000 people. Now 7000.  Well, when the whole country only has 5 million people... 🇫🇮
slapping meats 😂
Unpopular opinion, your title reminded me of islam
Yay! Your back!!!!! So excited!
CONGRATS ON 6mil 💛💛💛
I deffo beleive Jennifer was manipulated, but she still understood what she was doing was wrong. I wouldn't say karma for her cancer, thats kind of an awful life she had. Meets a guy falls in love even tho she knows it's not right beleives his bs and carries out an awful crime. Then goes on to rightly spend most of her life in prison only to get out and die of cancer.  Meanwhile Brian gets a lesser sentence and manages to walk free. That poor woman lost her life and children lost a mother. All because two people got a little frisky and couldn't keep there hands off each other.  I hope the family have managed to recover 🙏
My cat died the same day you posted this video after being hit by a car and the driver abandoned him. I enjoy listening to your voice, it relaxes me thank you, Bailey🖤
omfg i missed your vids so much
They both should have gotten. Life. No way did she think it was less of a sin nor did ahe carry the greater responsibility. Both are evil
Can ya please make a new updated detailed skincare routine video🤣🤗👍😋👏🖖✌🙏👍😘❤💋💎🎥🗝🛀 your skin is absolutely gorgeous!!!!!💋🌸🌞⭐🌈🦄🇺🇸😜😏🤗😆😇😵
Bailey what kind of sponge is that one you apply your setting powder with? Also I snagged me a pink “SUSPISH” tee. Love it
Hey Bailey Happy New Year! I've always wondered what kind of foundation and concealer do you use it looks awesome I even though you have probably perfect skin it looks like it covers great. Keep doing what you're doing you rock
Bailey, can you do one about Luca magnotta? Or Steven avery?
Bailey Sarian and Danielle Kirsty 🖤 will forever be my fav YouTube crime channels
“We gotta stop giving opinions on couples. We don’t know what goes on behind closed doors”
You tell ur stories so weirdly
I'm so happy ur back we missed u and ur stories hope u had a great holiday and a fabulous new year.
I can't believe he did that to his own children. Such a disgusting thing to take their mother away from them. I hope they have found peace and grew up loved.
I knew it was gonna be over a life insurance policy as sooonnn as I heard he changed his job. 🤦🏼‍♀️ Why are men so predictable?
Yooo my mom has lupis
The life insurance policy says it all on his behalf.
Yay home past 2 days super sick qnd probably be home tomorrow so glad all my utubers are posting especially you Bailey because you are the one who triggered a true crime passion for me. Ty so much
I squealed so loud when I heard you mention Colorado Springs, being a resident myself!
Bailey: So it wasn’t the husband Me: No no no I’m sure it will come back around that it was
“we gotta stop making comments on people and how perfect they are" THISSSS!!!!!  Facts
IMO (not that it's asked for but...) If you have an affair and it leads to someone's death You 100% should be forced to pay some kind of penalty (Jail time, Paying the family some kind of amount etc.) It isn't fair to only hold one half responsible, HE started the affair, and HIS WIFE paid the price.
THE QUEEN IS BACK FINALLY
Hi! May I suggest the "massacro del Circeo / Circeo massacre" case? Just to make you upset.
Loving the '90s, early 2000's hair style!!
The springs is not a small or nice town. El Paso county alone has over 700,000 people lol. It’s not a cute charming town by any means. I’m born & raised here. All it’s turning into is crime. Do not come here
I miss you
Welcome back!! I hope your break was relaxing. I’m gonna keep suggesting a MMM of the Darlie Routier case!
Definitely a cool place. That's where I live, youd dig it
can you do the menendez brothers please!
"After you just got done... Slappin meats together" 😭
Co springs is not charming yall!!! Also they have a kkk chapter there like actually we don't claim them
Hi!  Me and my husband just finished watching a new released series based on what happened in Knutby, and I immediately thought, Bailey should totally tell this story!. It's a religious cult in Knutby Sweden that murderd, brainwashed and manipulated people over many years.  Anywho, have a great day! Love ❤
Scienceeeee 👀 i love Bailey lol 😂
Where are the butterfly clips from 👀
#3 ON TRENDING!!!
Thank you! 😅
Sorry make-up question but how the F*CK do you know where to highlight and or contour???? Also which colours to use??? It looks like so much work lol
I would love to see you do Albert Fish when you come back. There's so much to him and the way you tell these stories os just great
It’s called the peacemaker because it’s presence was less likely to cause a fight
I like this cases when the story isnt too graphic ,i dont like the cannibal cases or the too violent ones
So glad you’re back! Love your hair! I think 🤔 both deserved life, but especially Jennifer. You control you!
I always can't wait for the theme song with these videos!!!😆😆🤗🤗❤❤
Thank goodness for the flower shop owner!!!!!!!
I feel very called out as a Jennifer. Around 20mins when Bailey does the questioning, I was ready to confess 😂😂 I don’t do well under pressure lol.
6 million subbies!
I love watching your videos, and I’ve always wanted you to talk about Mathew Hoffman who killed three people and kidnapped one person in Mount Vernon Ohio. Please look into this, would love to hear you talk about it!
If someone had told you as a kid that one day you'll have a wildly popular YouTube series and 6 million subscribers that began shu na na na naaaa naaaaaaaaaa what would you have said? I sing it along with you every time, never change it
I literally squeeled when I saw this I'm so happy you're back! Your videos make me so happy ❤️ Happy new year!
China and Blake Dickus Franklin Indiana it is an unsolved. Also Stephanie Moffett also unsolved in Franklin Indiana.
I Love You SM 😵‍💫❤️🥰
I moved here to Colorado about 3 years ago (so I'm not local to know these stories) and I started watching true crime when the pandemic started. And I just gotta say... why do SO MANY cases happen here in Colorado??? Wild. So many people here are very nice so it's wild that there's also this undercurrent of gun violence here.
Hiiiii Baily
i was the 1,001,157th viewer
I'd love to hear Bailey talk about the Annie Lee case! I rarely hear anyone discuss it
I missed you so much❤️
Number 3 on trending page!! Congrats!!!
Please please please do Starvation Heights in Olalla/Seattle Washington!! There’s a whole book on it too!!

Slappin' meats 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣🤣🤣

Please look into Laura blackkkkk!!!
colorado springs is not a small town, it is a large city but still love you!
“Slappin meats together.” STOP IT Bailey!!! 🤣💜
Insurance money and women 🤢 two ruined families. Poor children💔
Number 6 on trending. So proud
Me hearing they left the gloves and ski mask ..uh hello u just left ur DNA all over the inside of those gloves and mask!
When the picture of Bryan’s mugshot showed I screameddddddddddd
I feel like you should keep the same energy with dark history that you do with makeup mystery. if you’re not going to post makeup history videos, don’t post dark history videos either, just isn’t fair, especially since people enjoy makeup mystery more than they like dark history videos 🥺🥺
Please do the James Bolger case in 1993.
Ugh, of course the dude got away with it. Also, I was kind of right - he didn’t necessarily “hire” the mistress, but he convinced her to it. I feel like that’s the same thing.
What a brother!
The minute I found out it was the mistress I said "There is no man on earth worth this" and then you said it later lol I loved this one it was funny
i started 2022 by testing positive for covid on the 1st hahahaha  also i wish i could get that volume in my hair it's so nice haha i always love your hairrrrr <3
I only look forward to Mondays cause of u🥰
I live in Colorado Springs and I had no clue about this case. So interesting I really hope Brian isn’t in Colorado Springs 😬
I wonder if Brian watches YouTube..? 😂
I’m loving the butterfly clips bringing it back I see u
250,000 population is not a small town, it is a city.
Finally a story about my hometown!💙🗻 lol I mean I guess that's not a great thing.. Considering the circumstances.. But how exciting 😆
What’s the foundation brush 😅 🥰
“Slapping meats” caught me off guard 😂
Hi Bailey, I would love to have a watch party on twitch with your videos. Is there any way I can get approval to do this? I love your videos ❤️.
I know this is lame, but I‘m so thankful for your videos. I just had open-heart surgery and it’s going to be a long recovery. Your videos genuinely help a lot with passing time and making me laugh, with content that’s engaging and takes my mind off the discomfort I feel. The YouTube community is lucky to have you. Your humour and personality is like no other. Thank you ❤️
Happy 6 million subscribers
"Slapping meats together" 🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀
Yass the queen is back! its been a long few weeks without you!!
Check out Mary Bell.
Your hair IS sooooo cute! My mama died of Lupus in 2016. It's scary stuff.
I got my @BaileySarian jogger set in the mail today!!! I’m so excited!!! The shipping came way earlier than expected! Now I get to sit in my suspish outfit while doing my makeup and listening to this! ❤️🥰
Brian’s smile says it all. They both should’ve gotten life
Would you ever be interested in making hair related videos ?? You slay every video you are in i love your style you goddess !
Slappin meats together🤣💀😭
Come to Denver instead :)
I MISSED YOUUU
I’m so glad you’re back Bailey. Hope the holidays went well. Missed you. 💙💙💙
The moment Bailey said „it wasn’t the husband”, I went : I bet he had a side chick😏
not another case of men bringing in religion to justify and back up their filthy actions 🤡
You should do Madame LaLaurie next!
Idk about yall soon as she said Colorado Springs mt brain jumped over to homicide hunter (on hulu) to figure out what cause she was talking about
Baileys face expressions are EVERYTHING 😂 I love it here ♥️
Can we talk about how ALOT of gruesome stuff is always in Colorado?
Growing up in Colorado Springs. Yeah, it’s very miltary relgious conserivtive area. We have norad and Air Force acedemy plus new life church and other mega churches so I’m not surprised by everyone’s actions and this case.
You should do the shawn grate case!
What bronzer brush
Slapping meats! 😂🤣
I miss you much Bailey 🥺🥺🥺
I LOVE MY HOODIE BAILEY ♥️
smoking a blunt & doing my makeup while i watch is like one of my fav things lol
The Queen is back!!! Missed you. Thank you for making me looove Mondays now ♥️
I guess his red rocket took her brain off somewhere far far away
Bailey: "If you don't know what lupus is..." Me: "....then you obviously haven't watched House MD" :D Great to see you again Bailey! <3
wait ur tellin me ive lived in NC majority of my life.. and walmart sells GUNS?!?!
Please talk about the Josh & Susan Powell case! It’s bonkers and it will blow your mind
I would LOVE to see you do a video on Mary Anne Holmes from Arizona :D
Wynonna earp did it
Aye you just gotta love this woman. The commentary, the aesthetics, just ughh she’s so dope! 💜💜 and yes your hair is cute girl!!!
"Where is brian ? Brian is the kitchen " first leçon of english class in my country ...
Hey I remember this case now it’s one of Joe Kendal! :o
It was 2 psychopath’s who found each other, she wasn’t manipulated
Bailey, I missed you 🤗
Bailey, if you come to the springs id lose my mind
Thank you for posting videos you make my you tube worth watching
my toxic trait is that i ship ted bundy and jeffrey dahmer
OOOH ALBERT FISH OR ANDREA YATES :3
I’m from Colorado and every time someone from out of state talks about Colorado Springs they make it sound so cute but to me it’s just where the old racist white ppl live😭😭
Your hair texture like mines thick as heck o-o how do you get it to be manageable I need your secret for perfect hair! D:
I just miss her soo much. 😔 I am addictive to her. Her soothing voice 😌
Slapping meats 🤣
25:42 yeass this the vibe I've been missing from Bailey 😂✨✨
Anyone else find those mugshots CREEPY AF. BISH WHY YOU SMILING?!?
Me just sitting here eating Mac and cheese and popcorn chicken and drinking a slushy
Lol Bailey being a true Sagittarius in the intro! Can’t lie!!! Love her ❤️❤️❤️
Lol I wish Colorado Springs was like that 😂
Men make it so much worse than it needs to be just divorce and live your life dummies ended up in jail instead of together idiots
bro I thought she used the "peacemaker" because they used to go to church or something lol
Love your makeup this episode! think Jennifer was manipulated and tricked. You should do a story on Robert Durst, the guy who died recently. Love your channel Bailey!
Ummmmm ok. “Slapping meats” just took me out 🥴🤣
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! HAPPY YOUR BACK!!!
My name is Jennifer & I couldn’t help but giggle everytime you’d say my name 😅
They both were responsible. Happy New Year Bailey. I look forward to watching every Monday. Hope you had a great holiday. 🎆
I just feel sorry for the kids
Ok I need you to know that if I shout bailey, my 7yo twins run from wherever the are in the house to sing the theme song 🎵 🎶 😄
It’s something about the butterfly clips ♥️ 🦋
Love your videos ❤️ you should really look up the Molly Young Case!! Her family is still fighting for justice!! Spreading the word might help!
I think jen was definitely manipulated. But she deserved prison time for it. Brian definently should have been sentenced for life
Brian's mugshot was a little creepy 😳 😬 that fuccn smile like nooooo
I live in Colorado Springs,Co ! Lol
Please do vidoes about YUBA county five and The Robin hill/West Memphis Three murdurs!! <3
I’d love to meet Bailey in real life. Seems like she’d be a great person to be friends with
Missed seeing and learning from you- welcome back!
Please please please please talk about Israel Keyes!!! Thank you thank you ( in Bailey voice)
Lol was not expecting to see my towns university on here
Yey 💕 Welcome back. I like watching your videos before I sleep 💕 I have been a fan for 4 years and hoping you continue until you are aliveeee
Bailey I'm just watching your into.....do you mean your lying about lying? 🤣🤣
It was the definition of “ Peacemaker” for me 🤣🤣🤣
literally my first reaction was LOVE the hair 😍🔥
Love listening to your you tube channel and podcasts at work! Always wonderful! I wanted to know if you have ever come across the Andrew Lewis case from Alabama and what a twisted, unsolved mess it was. So sad and just goes to show what social status can help you get away with😟 Have a great day✨
Watched this on Homicide Hunter: Lt Joe Kenda on ID......as he was the investigating detective. I loved his show. He is badass. He cleared almost 400 homicides in his career.
Fun Fact! The model P, or "Peacemaker", was standard issue in the US Army for a time. Wyatt Earp also famously carried one during his time as a law man in Dodge City! The nickname is partly attributed to the firing power of the weapon, as one shot from the Model P would be enough to stop the fighting and make peace. Either because your rival was now dead, or so terrified of the power of the gun that they no longer wanted anything to do with you.
felt lost without, with-drawls suddenly gone.
who else lives for a her theme song😍😍😍😍😍😍💝💝💝💘💘💘
Bailey.... great video. thank you for explaining Lupus cuz a bunch of people don't know. I have it and RA so I'm autoimmune and I can't tell ya how many people don't know what it is or what it does and yes you're body is attacking itself. I got it double time unfortunately... your make up is always so beautiful btw.. I only wish I could do mine that well...  great job!
When Bailey mentioned Peacemaker all I could think about was Wynona Earp.
Horribly sad story. Your make-up is beautiful.
I think that Jen was tricked, manipulated. That mugshot of Bryan. It screams not trustworthy. Blaming it on some religious views, shut the front door.  Too many times crimes take a religious turn, when it turns out that it has nothing to do with religion. Somehow I feel bad for Jen
But the life insurance could have also been taken out because she was sick? Idk...
Called a peace maker because theoretically the battle is over with this weapon.
I freakin love you!!!😘😘
okay so watts case happened in Colorado… didn’t Shannan also have lupus?
Started my new year off with the flu. Yay 🙄
*slapping meats*
Love your hair!! 😁😁
Did anyone else tried to do the mouth click thing before noggin‘ with her without watching and was thrown off beat when she did it more than once ?
I love the hair! Can we get a hair tutorial please
Would love to hear the story of Jeffrey Lundgren / the Kirtland cult.
Bailey is bae 😍🌈
wasn't this an episode of homicide hunter? every time she says 'the cops/police' I'm just like 'Ah, you mean Joe? My main man, Lt. Joe Kenda?" 😂😂😂 EDIT: Season 2 Ep. 1 of Homicide Hunter
“Slamming meats together.” I spit out my water 💀😂
Ben and Jen 😅
bailey I really hope you see this comment pleaseeee cover the vanessa guillen story. it’s so sad😣😣😣 ps I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUCH GIRL
Oh M goodness Ms. Bailey Sarian 😍.  I really needed to hear this today, and I enjoyed watching your glam make overs. I have thoughts about this twisted "love" affair, but you pretty much said it all. Happy New Year to you and yours 💅🦸‍♀️🧚‍♂️🐅 Chinese year of the Tiger
Please do the Emmitt Till story next, it’s a very interesting story!!
Bailey is such a great storyteller. She draws you in and makes you feel like she is talking to you. Thank you for all the great stories, Bailey!
I wonder if the governor just didn't want to pay for her cancer treatment anymore.....filed under budget cuts for tax purposes.   '_'
Best birthday gift ever! A Bailey video.❤️
✨Can we get a little commotion for the hair ✨
Please do one on Shelly knoteck, the book “if you tell” was amazing and talks all about the horrors the victims went through
Welcome back Bailey ♥️♥️ i never received your notification.
My goodness, I've missed you!
Your doing your eyebrows! Normally you don't but I'm so glad you are rn!
Love this makeup!
All I could think about was their 3 children losing both parents in a short time. One to death and the guilty one to prison. So sad. I hope they're ok.
If anyone wants to hear about this case from a police perspective, it's featured on  Season 2, Episode 1 of "Homicide Hunter." Colorado Springs was legendary Lt. Joe Kenda's jurisdiction for a long time.
didn't really make joke but the way you said it made it sound like:  Diane: *in several pain cause got shot*  me (an empath) getting bad vibes from this situation
I miss you when your gone. Always take care of yourself! That husband should have been thrown in prison for life!
Despite the less than cheerful subject matter, Bailey has been able to maintain an ere of innocence that is so endearing! Let me give you a for instance: I thought the “peace maker” implied the victim would be finally at “peace” because they are dead. Bailey over here is all like, we can work it out!! Let’s come to a mutual agreement before you reload! Hahahah I love this channel.
Is this a Lt. Joe Kenda Homicide Hunter case…? My my my…
you called a population of 250.000 a 'small town'🥲 meanwhile I'm watching from a belgian 'town' with a population of 18.000 people😭✌️
Can you possibly do the true story of Joe Arridy?
ooooo Jennifer.... lol love Balieys comments
brb gonna go copy baileys hair
Congrats on over 6 million! You truly deserve it 🖤
I hope that you had a great holiday. And thank you so much for coming back on my birthday.🎂🎂 Best birthday present ever❤❤
jenniferrrrrrrrrr
it’s crazy to hear how colorado springs sounds to people that don’t live here cause 😭
It's called the peacemaker because you're going to die if you don't stop what you're doing.
I thought you said Peace Love Joint 😂💀😂 I won't take that last part since I can't stand smoke, but it made me think of grilled cheese instantly. That's joyful enough right?? 😆
Jon bonnet Ramsey pls thanx
29:06 i just wanna know who her hairstylist is in prison 😭
I marked it in my planner that you’d be back 😂😂😂😂
For a second I thought you were applying powder with a piece of bread 😂
Butterfly clips, your my hero.
BTK
Coffee with Bailey. It’s bliss. ♥️♥️♥️
Bailey, I love your content! I'm always turning in for every video. Please do a story on Kelly Cochran!
I think the plan was to get rid of Diane then ditching the clothes to frame Ben so both of them would be gone and Jennifer and Brian could live happily ever after. Great story! 💛
I need a hair tutorial ASAP on this style!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🔥🔥🔥
Hi Bailey! Can you take a look at the Kitty Genovese case? This should be interesting :-)
Wait hold on!!!! ***runs to change shirt*** twinsies!!!! Yay!
Cool i forgot about this show after i got a different tablet ,glad it popped up again now i can start watching again and i find them relaxing to fall asleep too 😴🥰
Hanging out in the Jacuzzy like “friends” haha. That part killed with Jennifer and the husband
Just vibin', folding laundry while hanging out with Bailey. A typical relaxed afternoon 😊 I save my laundry days for when there's a Dark History video or a MM&MM video. Welcome back Bailey!
That poor woman and her children! I believe they were both equally involved. They both knew what they were doing 🤦🏼‍♀️ Side note: Bailey tells a story like no other, narration and all. So happy to see you back after your break!
LOVE this look ❤️  Also, I feel like Ben was already on his way out if they had separated so she was the only one in the way
I have lupus 😩
Okay so let’s say, in theory, a partner you are cheating with tells you to 🔪✨ either your own partner, or theirs so that you can be together, and you get away with it. You and this person are happy together. Wouldn’t that cause severe anxiety? Like okay, they had me *or themselves* 🔪✨ someone to be with someone else because they were too scared to just leave the person, so why wouldn’t they do the same to you ? Like, people change so they might not want to be with you for forever. They could literally 🔪✨ you at any moment. Is that not scary to these people ?
You should research the Kelsey berreth case! It reminds me a lot of this one. The lady that was involved, Krystal kenney, actually lives in my home town and everyone here knows her so it’s pretty interesting!
Welcome back! 😀 Someday you could do the Stephen McDaniel story. That would be an interesting one too. 🙂
Number 3 on trending 😭😭 congratulations Bailey 💕
YAASSS I'VE MISSED YOU!  You had me rewatching all of your old videos.
You hit 6 million subscribers! Congrats girlllll ❤️
This was a weird story. Nice looking folks. But f*d up minds. Sing more!
I live here. It’s not cute lol. Very very pretty but too many people.
I don't but those faces that baily makes are epic.😉😜😜😜😜
Jennifer and Brian in their mugshots: CHEESE 😁
Hi Baley can you do a story on Sabrina Lemon, from Bakersfield CA
You're adorable 🥰🥰🥰
Next week, Mufasa’s death..the lion king 👌🏻😆
Thinking that these people are free, and could potentially be watching this video right now and nobody knows it is frightening.
This is the first time YouTube unsubscribed me from someone and it chose Bailey. Wth. Subscribed back ofc
Bailey, I love that you're still doing videos and not just podcasts. These videos give me life😁
I think they were both equally guilty and should have been in prison for life.
Idk if you'll take this as a compliment but I named my new puppy Bailey bc of you ❤️❤️
Hey Bailey!! I love your videos so much! I have a suggestion for a video you can do for Valentines. Look into Oscar Pistorius. He was a really famous South African Paralympic athlete - that is until he killed his girlfriend the night before valentines day... It'll be interesting to hear your take on the story, and also I think his parole hearing is coming up soon, which makes it even more interesting! Okay, love you, bye!
Brian watching this 👁👁   🤣🤣🤣
Love how the purple backdrop makes purple shimmers where you sectioned your hair ...
wonder what happened to his 2 kids. ?
Lizzie Borden please wanna know more about the story
I love the music at the end very nostalgic!
Congrats on 6 million Bailey!!!  🖤
I just love that you did this case! I thought it sounded familiar, and it is. This was one of Joe Kenda's cases and was on the show Homicide Hunter on the ID channel. :)
Love the opening theme song..😛😛😜😜😜😉
I love the extra long theme song😆😆😁😁 also yassss love the hair❤❤👏👏
you made my day <3
So happy to see you back missed you
I want to thank your parents for making you because who would I watch on YouTube  😩😂
If you haven't done it yet you should definitely do the Pennsylvania pizza bomber case
Honestly Brian sounds like a discount Manson 😂
Welcome back Bailey thank you for all your hard work!
Love the make up look btw👌💙
Congrats on 6 million subscribers!
A single action vs a semi isn't gonna show intent lol. You have to load every shot in s rifle too... And recocking is not the same as reloading
I get ready watching these videos and they take my anxiety away a but
You should look into the Kimberly Kessler case and what she did to jolene Cummings! Wild twists and turns!
Lupus is what my father got and he lived with it for 15 years, women tend to respond better to treatment than men actually. He passed away in his sleep after having missed his medicine one time. He did dialysis often and was on so many meds, it's truly a terrible disease
Bailey he probably had clothes on underneath 🤣
Slapping meats🤣 then to slapping cuffs
The show Winona Earp is all about “peacemaker”   Well… and demons, vampires, etc lol
You should talk about Elliot Rodger
you rock, Bailey!
Hilarious!! One of my favourite videos!! Not cause of the story, but the story telling!! 🤣❤️
You should do a dark history episode on Marie Antoinette!!
Manipulation is a very dangerous place, many get lost and never return back from there. Not excusing her of course, but speaking in general
Mitchelle Blair.... this was soooo messed up.  You will most definitely  need  disclaimer
It’s near one army base and 3 Air Force bases. Not a cute little town lol maybe it was back in the day. Prob a lot nicer back then I’m sure.  Love these videos 😍 A streaker 🤣😂🤦🏻‍♀️  And yes, your hair looks so cute
Me sad because I finished al Bailey’s episodes😔… and then remember that’s 1.11 and she was coming back on 1.10. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🤣   Pd. When you used your blender as a phone 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
I think they were a coupme Narcissistic people.  They planned it together.  She did it because she wanted to.  Wifey was in the way.  He did not want to lose his respect in church and wanted money.  Cold.  They should both still be in prison.
Kaaaarmmmaaaaa
Was it Jenifer?
love the hair , love the make up , and love the content  !!  have you thought about doing the OJ trial/story ? Look forward to new videos every week on both MMM & DH ....
Please do a video on Blanche Taylor Moore the Black widow of North Carolina!
I like ur shirt we r matching ;)
Wow. How could the brother come to Brian's defense KNOWING this dudbwas deliberately cheating on his sister. He clearly didn't care for his sister. And if she killed sis for him,than why would she just want to take him away
So so happy you kept your theme song.... ;) Yay!!!!
I was 5 mins in watching this last night but I got tired but I’m back this morning drinking my coffee🙋🏽‍♀️❤️ I love your Channel
Women are not that weak she made the choice herself.
SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK BAILEY😭
Why is there no nail polish on your pinky? Lol
😄 oh I've missed you Bailey.
Imagine Bailey sarian liking ur comment. I could die happy 😊
Whoever values himself to this comment clic like
Homicide Hunter staring lieutenant Joe Kenda ❤️
am i the only child who watches this womans videos?????
Welcome back Bailey!!! 💜💜💜💜
I love Bailey haha. And it's so obvious she's never been around guns lol. It was a "single-action" revolver, that's why you have to manually pull the hammer back each time before pulling the trigger. There are still single action revolvers made today, but yes there are also "double-action" revolvers too where all you have to do is pull the trigger.
Me: Giggling at how Bailey explains how to operate a revolver.  I <3 U Bailey, and I agree this was premeditated, but cocking a revolver isn't a long drawn out process... 😀
Bailey, have you watched the Netflix Documentary Son(s) of Sam? If brings a lot of new info about the case... It was so much bigger than once thought!
Somebody play “no body no crime” by Taylor Swift 😌
You should talk about the black strangler!!
Missed you girl! 😊💓
Honestly this is the best birthday present I could have gotten, another Bailey video ❤
I watched this while drinking my coffee in peace. Your videos are peaceful to watch no matter how fricken weird that sounds. I’m glad you’re back! You were missed ♥️
i have Lupus, Fibromyalgia and Rhumetoid Arthritis, pain......lots of pain
So happy seeing you with 6m subscribers now!!! I love your videos❤️‍🔥
Is it every other Monday now?
A day late but the best way so start the week!! Can't get over how stunning you are 🥰
Not my parents being named Brian and Diane 🥴
When you watch MMMM on Tuesday and lose track of all the days.
"Are we in clue" 😂😂😂
Great story! And you look gorgeous with this make up look!😍
This was CRAZY! They both should've gotten life, thought Jennifer was def manipulated.
Used to be cute and quaint. CO Spgs has grown way too much too fast. lol
The Peacemaker (Colt Single Action Army) was a standard issue firearm given to the US Calvary and it was super popular with soldiers, ranchers, and outlaws in the "Wild West" days. Definitely a gun that is meant to pack a punch, hence the name. They hold .45 caliber rounds!
Hard to say. But they were both involved and none of it would have happened had they  been living right.  Just shows how much of a waste of lives to do evil stuff is.  Live your life right and don't be evil. Basically
Can you do the Lucas Hernandez case? It’s not covered anywhere
missed you!! :D
I love when murderers get released from prison and then they just die. That's karma honestly🤷‍♀️
So glad you are back ....!!!  Hope your holiday was great for you too!!...  Thank you.
March 24 is my bday 😟
Mmm, no, I liked the third "Knlnmimcl-ick, Noggin". Welcome back, B!  Happy New Year!
I just ordered the shirt you are wearing. I ordered one through another site and it’s in China. So disappointed. Went to your website and got that shirt and I had problems with the discount but customer service was amazing!!!
Can you do one from Delaware?!
Was It karma, or maybe it was 'God's plan!' Bom bom bom.
Slapping meats hahahah
Ben was TOTALLY meant to take the fall for this. She wore HIS clothes, dumped them where they could be easily found WITH key evidence of the "robbery" AND she begged him to TAKE THE GUN BACK???? MA'AM. 🤨
Girll she got what she had coming lol they are both gonna be visiting the devil
Robert Durst just died - have you covered his crazy story yet, Bailey?
Okay but who can go to a supermarket to get a gun? What am I missing?
❤️🇬🇧🌹  HAPPY NEW YEAR!  🌹🇬🇧❤️
Bailey your video feels like hanging out with a friend and gossip, and I am here for it!!!
You could get ate
“What in the time travel is goin on right now” 😂🤣🤣
Now I have to look up the peacemaker 😂💚
CO springs WAS cute and charming... not so much anymore, its to bad.
I live in Colorado Springs 😊 it's not a small town anymore 😪
The amount of sass in this! I'm here for it
Love these videos and 6 million subscribers now 😍 🙌 ❤
"after you just got done slapping meats together" HAHAHAHAHAHAHA LOSING IT RN.
I was wondering if you could do one on the Zara Baker case! It happened close to my hometown and they just did a special on HLN on it. Love to hear your narration on it!
I really missed you ma'am .
I feel like both of them deserve to be in jail for life… but also like, if Brian would have gotten away with it, 100% sure he would have started a cult and became a cult leader.
18:56 - 19:09 I passed out laughing...u r so funny :-p
Had to say.... Love the hair ! 🤟🏼🖤
always such a little shock to hear your city’s name randomly lol
I was here from the start Bailey
Never change the theme song
I missed these videos! I’d love for you to cover the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. It’s probably the most famous British crime investigation. She disappeared in 2007 and only last year, the police managed to solve it 🤍
Thank you for describing lupus! I have lupus and it gets old explaining what it is :)
Just left Colorado Springs….part of the worst vacation ever but still had fun.
I thought witnesses said the shooter was 6 ft 7 in, how could it have possibly been her ??
Let me tell you how much I appreciate you not bashing christianity or bullying christians. Most youtubers would have taken every opportunity
Please do one on the Salem witch trials!
Lol 😂
bailey, girl, check out the ERA(Equal.Rights Amendmant)  and the fact that in the land of the free and the home of the brave women don't actually have equal rights to men,  like figuratively and literally.  you can also learn about the fact that one of the people who fought hardest against Equal Rights Amendment (which still hasn't been passed to this day was a woman ).  I would strongly advise taking an Excedrin before you look into it ...
I think they were equally involved, but I don’t believe she was tricked. I think they planned to split the insurance money.
THOSE BUTTERFLY CLIPS!
Missed you Bailey! Hope you enjoyed your break 😘
Idk if you ever keep your bloopers but for this year I would loveeee a gag reel!!!  ❤️❤️❤️ THANKS FOR GREAT CONTENT (You know like amazing delivery, humor, the Looks, not the actual horrible things ppl do)!
She wasn’t manipulated she was trifling. Sorry not sorry
Welcome back!i already watched al ur MMM and I need a new episode ♦️♥️♠️♣️cheers from Mexico city
Ur hair is beautiful like that fr!
Everyone else: horrified by gun owners  Me: Man, I'd love to have a Peacemaker for our collection 🙈🤣
How strange to hear my favorite True Crime YouTuber cover a case about a person I have met who is very near and dear to people I love. Sort of surreal.
S-sorry? Pick up guns. At- at WALMART? What in the america
I don't think you've talked about Larry Eyler before. I just watched something covering his story and would love to hear your version of it
Another reason to hate the name Jennifer more than I already do. 😫
BAILEY 💕 your hairs cute ! You’re cute !
Every time I hear “Colorado Springs” I think of homicide hunter on the ID channel 🤣
Oooooo I’m pretty sure Joe Kenda solved this. I love love love Joe. He’s solved almost 400 homicides. He’s got a show called homicide hunter for more true crime cases he’s solved
I love Bailey no doubt. However, this story wasn't idk mysterious enough. 🤔
Happy New Year, queen! Welcome back💜
Bailey: It was noooot the husssbaaand! Me: Then it's his mistreeeeeessss!
It is so refreshing to see the spooky background while it’s 20 degrees outside 👻
Prettiest look ever!
A revolver from the 1870’s, STREAKERS from 1970’s…. I see a theme here.😂
It’s so sad because all those kids Jennifers kids and Brian‘s kids don’t have a mother🥲
Molly Young's mysterious death and the corruption of a department refusing to properly investigated will be 10 years old this year. She died in Carbondale, IL. She deserves justice.
it did not treat me and my family right my dog Nina died on the 4th
Lady, have you done Alyssa Bustamante yet?? If not, do it! oo && Shawn Grate..
If my husband continues snoring and I have to unalive him and you do a video on me make sure you say my name like you did Jennifer’s!!
❤💐🥰😘 to you Bailey for bringing the content
My thing is both of those women had children and they are the true victims. Poor things. How could a mother do something so terrible knowing she will lose her kids and make Dianne's kids suffer!!  Evil!!
Hiii Girl! <3 always enjoy your content and you
oof the jumps are of bryan’s mugshot🤣🤣
I think you should do a family annihilator case. Much love Bailey!!! 😘
I visited my boyfriend who is stationed at Fort Carson and oh my gosh bases are like there own little town and it’s cute. Everyone there was so nice I absolutely loved it!
your hair looks so full and healthy Queen ! please give us a hair care video. would LOVE to know some of the products you use . thx love
Can you do the Jon Benet Ramsey case?
I like the episode on YouTube better than facebook
Please please do the story of bobby Kent 🙏🙏🙏
Sipping my coffee and doing my make up my morning routine listening to Bailey!❤️
Is that an Audrey 2 back there? 💚✨
☹️
I watched this on homicide hunter!!!!!!!
Missed you Bailey!
My nightly bedtime storyteller. Thanks Bailey!!!!!
Slapping meats together. This is why I watch Bailey
Best birthday gift was opening YouTube and seeing this video pop up... thank youuuu🥰
I would love to hear Bailey make fun of Elliot roger
Can we please show some appreciation for Bailey’s make up people??
Heather Elvis' case
Always trips me out to see people smiling in their mugshot 🙄
Small town ?! I’m an hour away and springs isn’t small really ☺️
Sooo… technically is always the husband… in one way or another 🤷🏻‍♀️
I missed you Bailey!! Happy new year💛
Me living in COS: 😀 Bailey: "Colorado Springs" Me:👁👄👁
Lol the “peace maker” is a single action revolver. You can buy brand new single action revolvers. But I believe the peace maker was one of the first of the kind to be widely manufactured and distributed. You would not have to reload after every shot, as the chamber spins to the next round until the cylinder is empty.
“Maybe you can  get a sense of the area & the people who live there — army spouses, church-going folk, locals who work in flower shops — that sort of thing.”  Actually the entire “story begin” section is comedy gold. You are funny AF. thanks sis 💖
I really was thinking your hair looks especially cute today!
I don't think she was manipulated, but I do think they planned it together.
I tried to Bailey, but I can’t watch another Chanel of true crime
YES SHES BACK ❤️❤️
Story idea for either MMM mondays or dark history — “the mother of modern adoption” Beula Georgia Tann
i mean i feel for jennifer because she was manipulated sort of but at the same time the way she killed her seemed so calculated and just cold.
Poor Diane.  Rest in peace 🙏 And the kids :( Bailey u are the best storyteller.  You make me laugh 😃  Jen and Brian are bad people 😕
i always watch your video everytime i do my makeup <3 or when i do art
Vanessa Guillén
DO A VIDEO ON COURTNEY PALMER! the first 48 case pretty pleaseee! I need answers only you can give me!
I was going to sneeze so I paused the video but then ended up sneezing on my phone and Bailey's Face was like 14:57 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 oh no i can't pin point it on the vid but its was the cross hands and she has her eyes closed 😭😭😭 too perfect
Ben gave her the peacemaker because he had a better fighting chance against it if she chose to use it on him.... ALSO it's not like a antique gun, the peacemaker is THE antique gun... it's the same idea as why felons can legally have a muzzle load gun....
Were they trying to frame the husband with the gun and clothing? If so, why do it when he was at work for the government?
I think that's a natural trait of Sagittarius, bad liars, feel bad for lying 😅
😁😁😁😁🔆🧡EEEEEEEEEEEEEKKKK!!!!! PART OF THIS ONE TAKES PLACE IN MY HOMETOWN.....sorry, I apologize for yelling, but I got 😊 🧡🔆😁😁😁😁
Icon
Lieutenant Joe Kenda
Moral of the all true crime stories stay away from “Brian’s”
Had to ask my dad if he knew about this one because who on earth gives an antique gun to his wife for protection I'm sure that he was like she won't need to use this it's just for her peace of mind but lord. Ps I hope her kids got the life insurance in any case...
I missed you 🥺❤️
Butterfly clips! ♥
Make up and hair FIRE 🔥😍
Whenever men F up we blame a woman. Whenever women F up, we blame a woman.
Ahhhh I missed you!!!
Ok. Lol. Never heard my name like that. Made me cringe so much! 😂
Anyone else curious if Bailey watches "Wynonna Earp" with how she calls a revolver "peacemaker"? 😂 Love it.
It's called the peacemaker because it ends the fight, leaving someone at peace.
This theme song brought me ceratonin 3yrs ago and it still does to this day lol
this case was on joe kenda
I've heard this case before, Lt Joe Kenda was one of the detectives on the case and covered it on his show Homicide Hunter. Diane and a friend were walking out to their cars when Jennifer came up and robbed them at gunpoint, taking her time to make sure Diane was dead. The friend noticed that the shooter, originally presumed to be a short slim man, put Diane's purse over their shoulder as they ran off - the way a woman would carry a purse. The friend ran back inside the support group place to call 911. I thought that was an interesting detail and Lt Kenda talks about hearing that tidbit from the witness and it stood out to him. It's season 2 episode 1 if anyone is interested.
Hey Bailey, Happy new year! Was looking forward to this day. Can you please consider covering the case of Chris benoit the wrestler?  In terms of this case I think they both were guitly.  Just because Jennifer pulled the trigger didn't make Brian any less guitly. With the life insurance he stood to benefit from Diane's death.
Me: It’s the husband yep  Bailey: now I know what you’re thinking…it’s the husband…  Me: 😐
I’m having a the worst day, thank you for posting. I love your videos.
Bailey: “He was an Insurance Broker” Me: “😳😳” Bailey: “Don’t worry, it wasn’t him”
I live here. It's horrible here. Don't come here 😭😭😭 I wanna leave so bad
Why the beep was she smiling in her mugshot~!
Brian is just as guilty. That insurance shuffle is standard MO for spouse killers. I think his defense attorneys just played on the prejudices against "scorned women" and "fatal attractions."
Boy, did we miss you, Bailey!!! And you giggling when talking about cocking a gun... :D
I need those hair clips in my life
Do the Jamie Closs case!
Colorado Springs native lol born and raised
I wasn’t paying attention for a second and then heard Bailey repeating my name over and over. My brain broke for a second 😂
I really hope u and Swoop do a video together sometime! Happy New Year!
I missed your uploads so much! Why does it feel like you were gone for a year instead of several weeks? Thank you for being the awesome person that you are, and for sharing that amazing persona with us!
Yesssssss
she’s back! tg
You should change your background because if you keep one it will lose it unique attraction.  Yes they both should have gone down for 1st degree and he should have gotten life without
Tell me you have adhd without telling me you have adhd
Lol Bryan come on In 😆 🤣
No one had Diane's back - not even her own family. Infuriating.
Rest in peace Diane 🥲 Such a tragedy, it must really hard especially for their children. 😭
Thank you for helping me through more than you’ll ever know.
me living in colorado springs 💀
Congrats on 6 Million ❤️ the best true crime storyteller 😍
As a Christian I do not claim that monster.
Not gonna lie the PeaceMaker kinda made me happy wearing about since I got one from my late grandpa collection it was an old cowboy gun my great great+ grandpa was a sheriff here in Colorado
I just watched a couple of things about Rachael Staudte - she and her mother poisoned their family. I'd LOVE to see you do an episode on them! Fecked ep!
I can't believe how easy and fast you wing your eyes!! It's amazing!! Takes me a stencil and 100 tries 🤣 I'll just watch you do yours  and be happy instead of making myself look like a zombie
I lost it at “slapping meats” 😂😂 I freaking love you Bailey!
Happy New Year! I believed he let her take the blame. Yes she shot his wife but I felt he set the entire thing up and he knew how to manipulate her.  He took out a life insurance policy on his wife, huge red flag. He masterminded the entire thing.
Hmmm... now that he's died, will you cover the Robert Durst case(s)? Or am I the only person alive that wants you to tell the story of that guy?
WOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Very lifetime movie of them…. cuuuhhhhhhhhttteeee”
Bailey dear, I’ve spent a lot of time in Colorado Springs. It’s a weird town, and always has been.  It’s a mix of military, hippies, and ultra conservatives………. It’s pretty there but the people are weird
6M! WE DID IT! 🎉
As someone with an autoimmune disease this story kind of hit me.. I can’t imagine the pain and hurt Diane was going through up to that point.. may she Rest In Peace.. 🙏🏻
Theme song is my vibe
6m subs🥳🥳🥳🥳
Something isn’t right about this story, ion know. I feel like it was definitely a set up and they all had something to do with it. It’s the way they worded things. “Make sure you shoot her twice” the husband taking the gun from here KNOWING she needed it for “protection”; ion know there seems like a lot of the truth has been covered up or overlooked… Condolences to this woman’s family, such a tragic situation. 🙏🏾💯😢
Could you please cover the Australian story of Anita Coby?
Being in the UK where our gun laws are so strict, it’s almost impossible for me to imagine my local store selling guns… what even is America????
Congratulations on 6 million subscribers, your awesome and deserve all the success. Queen Bailey
The ONLY reason he didn't pull the trigger, is because he knew he would be the first suspect. So he got someone to do it for him, definitely deserved equal sentences.
My name is Jennifer and I felt like I was being chastised through this whole video.
Do you remember when Paris and Nicole used to sing your theme song… 😂😂😂
My name is Dianne and every time Bailey says it I feel like I’m in trouble ? Anyone else
I feel so rude for having to pause sometimes that I always go "Sorry Bailey, go on" when i get back and hit play :P
WAIT. Colorado Springs in 1990?? Did anyone else immediately think of Detective Joe Kenda?!
Bailey.... the way you kept saying "Jennifer...!" made me think I was in trouble.. and I did nothing. hahahahahahahahahah
Congratulations on 6M subscribers 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
hahahhaha the clicking noggin part. bailey you absolute adorable goober.
Glad You are back! I have been waiting for your newest video! I know you probably get lots of story requests, but you should check out the case of Kimberly Kessler and Jolene Cummings. It’s a doozy
I don't like make-up but I love crime and how Bailey tell stories ^^
I missed watching this so much glad you're back. Best Wishes Bailey!
Love you, so glad your back.
Welcome back!!! I MISSED YOU!!🤍
Can you post which brushes you use?
Honestly I think Jennifer should have never been let out of jail. I also think that while the husband may have wanted her gone and even expressed that to Jennifer, Jennifer still had her own brain to make decisions. We have got to stop acting like somebody can have that kind of control over someone else. They weren’t even in a living together situation. I think Jennifer just wanted what she wanted when she wanted it and took the actions to make that happen. While  I do believe the husband should have gotten some jail time I actually think his sentence was too heavy. I think Jennifer should’ve just stayed in jail forever.
yooooo its 2022
who the ✨flip-flop✨ would everrrr smile in their mugshots      ugh. people 🙄
Does Jennifer kinda look like a vanilla version of Bailey? Like, could play her in the TV movie?
Hahah i like your peacemaker assumption too
“What in the time travel, are we in Clue” - Dead
missed you❤️
31:55 I legit for a SECOND thought he's gonna come out lol 😂 Bailey's humour never fails to make me giggle/laugh out loud everytime :>
When researching did you watch the video of Candice DeLong interviewed her?
Waited to get the kids to school to watch this one 🇮🇪🇮🇪 😂 glad your back on YouTube 🙌 hope you enjoyed the holidays as well as can be expected 🥰🥰
Wyatt Earp would roll around in his grave at knowing what his gun is doing SMFH!
And this is why Christians get labeled as crazy🤦🏻‍♀️
Miss Bailey, did you know that in the UK the peace sign backwards mean f**k off 😆 Right at ya babe 😘
Why is it that those that are involved in church activities are the ones who are prone to be involved in this kind of criminal situations? And then those that are not too religious are somehow kind to their neighbors and simply generally decent. Makes me always wonder what is going on in their heads!
I’m 1:58 in and the story takes place where I live… hits different 😭
🍎↙️👖👢
Please can you do a video on Israel Keyes 🖤
not you talking about my city😭 why did I decide to put this on at 6 am I’m definitely not going back to sleep also co springs is very militaary oriented! We also have NORAD
As an european, I 'm just surprised at how people describe getting guns in the US "grab one at Walmart quick and easy"..in my country not even security guards have gun license let alone a simple civilian O.O
Ok I usually agree with you Bailey... but the life insurance ugghh .. she was a sick woman so I can understand the insurance. But I feel they are equally responsible.  The fact they both got out after taking a life is mind blowing 🤯
When talking about seggs:   Everyone:  “bumping uglies”   Bailey Sarian:  “slapping meats”  🤣
Me to all my fellow true crime nurse enthusiasts on a night shift, "You ever heard of Bailey Sarian..."?.... All of us 3hrs later: Well that was wild😂
Bailey Bailey Bailey Bailey please do one of these from Canada the Steven Truscott story or Dustin Bowers baby in the snow
"I know. What in the time travel is going on right now? Are we in Clue?" 😂😂😂💀💀💀
I feel so sorry for the children.
I missed you soooooo much. Happy 2022, Bailey!!!! <3
As someone whose name is Jennifer, Bailey constantly going "Jennifer!" has me instantly going "im sorry!" aye
Please do the story on Albert fish the werewolf of wysteria aka gray man aka the Brooklyn vampire aka moon maniac aka boogeyman or Oscar pistorius south African paralympic runner he killed his girlfriend reeva steenkamp
Congratulations on 6M subs, Bailey ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Jennifer was no victim. Both should rot in jail.
Bailey! You should talk about Albert Fish ❤️🤲🏻
BAILEY CAN YOU DO A STORY ON THE BEAUMONT CHILDREN ?? MY MUM ASKED ME TO ASK U ❤❤🌟🌺🥀🏵🌷🌻🌼🏵🥀🌺
Your videos make my day!🌻
Tbf normal revolvers need to be cocked every time you fire them. Actually.. I thought most handguns were like that. I thought semiautomatic handguns were illegal 🤷‍♀️ I guess not
Every time I see a new video from you my mind goes: "Yay, so great to see you, my imaginary BFF!" 😄❤ Thank you for being You!
BAILEY: It was Dianes husband who put it up to her  Me:🤔You mean, WHO PUT HER UP TO IT? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You should do Lemuel Smith
thier mugshotssss fk
We missed u Bailey!💜
Nobody   Bailey: slapping meats together
Jennifer died on my birthday, 😏
Greeeeeeeeat intro 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍😍😍
As someone who's had Lupus for 26 years I feel so bad that Her life ended this way when Us Lupus suffers fight so hard Everyday  May She Rest In Peace 💜
This hits differently when you have the same name of the victim.
I’ve literally had Bailey withdrawals! I hope you had a wonderful Christmas!
It's Showtime!
Kendrick Johnson. Valdosta Ga.  PLEASE  look into this case.
Woo! Hi, Bailey :)! It's fine that you filmed this before your break.
I’d love a video on the Turpin 13/Turpin family, feel like you would give those 13 kids so much justice in the way you tell their story !!
I need a Bailey x Ballen video and/or podcast collab in my life 😭😍   You both have such unique story-telling styles, but I feel like you would mesh so well and just get along well. It would be the collab of the century in the true crime/creepy community.
It’s always the so-called devout Christians that commit the worst sins I stg
......... Slapping meats together. How romantic.
THE WAY I SCREECHED WHEN I SAW THE NOTIFICATION THE NEXT MORNING BECAUSE TIME DIFFERENCE IS A B!TCH AYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYA
Your hair is sooooo caaauuuttteee!!!
Hey girl, welcome back again 👋🏽
Bailey when you said let's hope 2022 treats us right and made that face and noise I laughed so hard I wheezed! 🤣 😭🤣 You are hilarious!
Sitting here with covid but Bailey has made my day 1000 times better already
They were trying to get rid of Ben when Jen gave back the gun to frame him
Can you look up Robert Maudsley and do a story on him?
Spoiler alert:            I thought I knew this one, then I didn’t and now I’m sure. This one has been featured one Female Killers, from the point of Jennifer’s view.
I can firmly say 2022 is not treating me right.
Clifford Allen Davis or the Newsom/Christian case!!!!
So glad your back!!! Missed you sister!!
The queen is back!!!!!!
Bailey,  how do you put so many layers of product/concealer/foundation on your face without it looking clumpy or cakey?  It always looks so perfect and smooth !
Slapping meat 🙈🙈 never heard that before.  Absolutely love this show. I tell everybody in the UK about you.  I'd love to hear your take on some English crimes 🙏🙏
250,000 is a small town.....there is less than 4,000 where I live 🤷🤦😂🤣.
Yay!!!!!!
Diane and Brian sound like the teen movie couples. The cheerleader and football player xD
Yay I am so glad you're "back" lol, I hope you had an amazing Christmas and had the best New Year Bailey ❤ 2022 is going to be a great year!!!! 😊
This was on Joe kenda: homicide hunter!! I love that show!! Binged every season.
Gasperellaaa lol
Why are all the psychos called Bryan
You're so funny lol I love your comments and stuff
As soon as I heard thin man I thought..a woman
You saying jacuzzi reminded me of Kanye west
Brian is the predator, he just found someone to trick in to doing it, I recon
I hope Brian sees this 😹
The only people I am sorry for is the children of these to family's that have been  ruined
The justice system is ridiculous  😤😤😤
Single action revolvers are actually super fast to shoot. You just have to continuously hold the trigger and rapid fire hitting the hammer. I’ve seen someone shoot 12 rounds plus reload a single action revolver in less than 5 seconds!
bailey hit 6 million !!!!!!!
Should do Lizzy boarden
Love 22.
Collab with katya please 🥺
Congrats 👏 👏 👏 👏 on 6 million subs @Bailey!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I opened YouTube and saw this video on my newsfeed and yelled “YES BAILEY!” - your MMM videos have been dearly missed!!!
Wow this reminds me so much of a case here in Sweden! The Knutby case might be fun to look into if this was interesting! There the woman was only in a psych ward for like 7 years as punishment.
Love youuu
We are back together again 😘💜💜💜from East Africa coast 👍
The "peacemaker" has a very glorious history. And deserves to be told. I'll try to keep it short. In 1859 Samual Colt came out with a 6 shot.32 revolver called the "Navy Revolver" . The Gun of choice for Robert E Lee & Doc Holliday. However, in 1870 Smith & Wesson's patent ran out. and the army offered a contract for a .45 6-shot. so Colt redesigned his Navy .32 and made it a shorter version that weighed a little more  and was longer. But most importantly it shot metal bullets instead of paper ones (yes paper ones). .444-.40 ones were sold to civilians.  This was the gun of choice for Theodore Roosevelt and Wyatt Earp. it's called the "Peacemaker" beacause it is said to be the gun that won the west. In 1941 Colt stopped production of the civilian version of the Peacemaker for the war. However after the war it was considered old fashioned and outdated. But it was popular again by western movies so in 1956 Colt started production again of many different models, barrel lengths and calibers and is still in production to this day.
Slapping meats 😂
HIIIII HAPPY NEW YEAR ❤️❤️❤️ for 2022 I wish you get millions of followers and lots of beautiful things   so you can share with us☺️💯💯
It’s the butterfly clips for me. Girrrlrlllllll
So typical for men to have an affair as soon as the wife is diagnosed with something smh
Hehe it's a Peacemaker bc it settles an argument once and for all.
“this isn’t your typical gun where you’d like go into a Walmart and pick it up real quick”   Meanwhile in the UK I get ID’d for Paracetamol 🤯🙃
BAILEY's BAAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!
Congrats on 6M subs😭😭😭😭💋💋💋❤❤❤❤❣❤💞💕💕💞you are truly the best
Now it can be 2022 that Bailey is back.
Fred and Rosemary West pls. Also Billie Jo Jenkins.
I live in the springs, eh it's ok lol some places are cute
Anyone else struggled with out Bailey? So glad you are back
I have lupus and it's rough to say the least. So does my mom. And I'm crossing my fingers that I didn't pass it on to my kids. 💜 💜 ✌️
I need to watch this videos more than once, first time ALWAYS I’m listening to the story and laughing, after that I can divide my attention to the makeup 😂😂😂
YAYYYYYYYYYY
Yes , finally lol I was going threw all your 2 yr old videos.. still kept me entertained but always looking forward to your new videos .
Ok, I'm six minutes in and already I'm thinking the husbands got to be behind this, or his girlfriend is, the usual story ,lets carry on and see how it turns out
Mondays are really weird without our your upload. I hope you had a GREAT Christmas and New Year!!💜💜💜
YAY!!!!!! I MISSED YOU!!!!
Or you can talk about Emmett Till because this is truly sad. Let's speak about it and bring racism to light this shouldn't have happen but it did. I am black and this is sad please because if you don't talk about it I will!!!!! This hurts my heart
Missed you Bailey ❤️ Happy New Year!
On a real note you should take a can of soda or Sparkling water for the snap in the theme song. I'd literally die laughing hahaha
i strongly believe she wanted it to look like ben did it so she can be with brian 🤔
Always nice to see you and your great story telling
Yes to this..... Stop saying everyone was the " perfect couple" ! Then when it got to the husband/high up in the church/insurance salesman....  HELLO!!  I was like his mistress....he had a mistress for sure! 🤔
All the clips make Bailey look like she’s got a cyberman helmet on hehehe love you Bailey!!
I always wonder when Bailey talks about recent stories, whether the people who it is about, like Brian here, would see this🤔
13:16 Maybe it's the girl he was having an affair with.
*tank u, tank u* and the loooonnngggg drawn out theme song did me in...love this funny, kind, brilliant minded girl.
I love you thank you sis🖤🥰🤞🏾
So im from the UK an listen to some of the stuff Bailey says about guns, has me giggling.
Bailey: this isn't the gun you go pick up at your local Walmart  me, Italian: is once more reminded that Americans can pick up guns on their daily grocery run
@bailey sarian I knew butterfly clips would make a comeback! ❤️❤️ Ya, happy New year.
Just got to the part of the revolver.  Not sure if it states such, later in the video, though — Wyatt Earp was known for carrying a Peacemaker.  Interesting, as I’ve been watching one of my favorite movies — Tombstone — nearly on repeat, the last two weeks.
And she held that note.
Slapping meats lol!! That made me chuckle 🤭… bumping uglies!!
This Jennifer is so gullible that she believed the obvious manipulator, just messed up, this is just messed up.
Lupus :(
Girrll. I know its weird but your videos give my strength for the week. Helps my unwind and smile. With all the negativity in the world. Your positive personality is contagious
You can buy guns at WALMART?! America is really something else
I was not prepared to hear the words “slapping meat” so straight faced 😂😂😂👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Is the repeat on purpose?
can you do the story on the BOY  IN THE BOX 📦 PLEASE
Sounds like karma said nahhhhh bisch 😬😬
Yay Bailey hit 6 mill
Okay but why is she smiling in the mugshots
How did you do your hair? HUHU
MISSED YOUUUUUUUU ♥️♥️ living for the butterfly clips 😩
Why do these things always happen in Colorado
Takes out life insurance policy on spouse...*every episode of Forensic files ever*  🤣🤣🤣
That side picture of Jennifer at trial makes her look like a child.
YEEESSS BAILEYYYY
I honestly thought when there was the army fatigues and antique gun belonging to Ben, part of the plan was to frame Ben for Diane's death. Crazy story.
Women privileges
SMALL TOWN?! My town has 3,500 people in it.
"I like my assumption better" Oddly relatable
Thanks for the 411 on Lupus Bailey!  You educated folks on it very well!  Usually you hear 'it is a fake illness." thanks for the reality!
Aaaah I missed this, it's like a weekly hangout with my bestie and I get to learn something new 🥰 happy 2022 to you Bailey, I wish you more success, happiness, peace and love in your life 💜 I aspire to have a perfect makeup look like you do every time 😍
I lived in Colorado Springs for four years. I loved it!
Bailey can I request about the suspecious death of  rasputin?
Yesss
Yep, both of the paid justified as El is the Absolute Judge. Omaine
I live for these videos. Anyone else take down makeup notes while watching as well? Lol
Hello sunshine I dont know if you have done this case or not it hits close to home for me but in the world wide shock  of gabby petitos case there was a kidnapping of Denise amber Lee  from north port fl years back another story im all too familiar with is the story of Helen buchel and Brittany passalacqua from Geneva NY which resulted in Brittany's law being passed in the state of NY
Caulk the gun lol
I have both Lupus and Multiple Sclerosis. Bailey you have been my lifeline many times. At times I can't leave my bed for months. Love and hugs from Kentucky.
Love that you brought the chin wave back!  My daughter & I both watch you & love both your shows!
HAPPY YOU'RE BACK!!!
Bailey I swear to say your funny is an understatement!!! "Slapping meat's"  I'm dead😁😁😁I thought I was the only 1 that can't lie , if the lie is small or big I always say it or laugh like a fool and of course it's written on my face🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ I'm loving the hair!!! it may seem easy but let me tell you it is definitely isn't, usually the easy styles frustrates you the most!!!!
I have always believed religion was a fight for who's imaginary friend is best.
Queeen! We need a hair tutorial 😍🔥🔥🔥
Missed you, but so glad you had a lovely holidays with family and rest.
yeyyyy! happy new year love ❣
hiiiiii . <3
Hello Bailey  Happy New Year.  so glad to watch your videos again
My brother has a peacemaker. It's a rather large weapon it's called a peacemaker due to the large size. When people see it the fight stops.
Oh Bailey, how I long for you to be my best friend. We would be LIKE 🤞🏼🧙🏼‍♀️.
I love how you educated what lupus is. Great job!! (I'm a nurse and it made my nerdy nurse heart happy lol.)
I live in Colorado Springs and it’s not like that everyone here is crazy
So I guess we are down to like 1 (or 2 if we're lucky) of these videos a month...??
Welcome back and Happy New Year Baily.  I have been wanting to make a suggestion/request for ages, the moment I had heard about this woman I literally binged on YouTube episodes and Spotify podcasts about it but would always find myself saying, "but I want to hear Bailey tell the story."  OK so the lady is Linda Hazzard.  She believed in fasting to cure all ailments. She wrote a couple books about it and actually managed to convince quite a few women to allow her to treat them and most ended in death.  Including 2 British heiress sisters whom were her most infamous victims. It's an older story. Takes place in the early 1900s but it is soooooo trippy.  It's also known as "Starvation Heights" check it out.
Welcome back :)
When you said Colorado Springs I was shook I live there
She makes me laugh the way she puts things 🤣
I gave your hair a standing ovation. I couldn't do a wave the cats were mad.
Bailey,  they may have paroled her because she had pancreatic cancer and not long to live.  My mom was diagnosed with it and passed 3 months later in 2001.  At the time the 1 year survival rate  was 5% and the 5 year survival rate was 3%.   Compassionate release is a thing.
Someone said: 'it's not 2022, it's 2020 part 2' 🤣
"If she's going down, everyone's going down with her." CHANDLER BING MOOD!
Not all people that are  born again are bad people
Missed ya Bailey, love your videos and the new merch looks great!! I told the hubby I need a suspish, t shirt for valentine's day
Hi, Bailey!  If you haven't already done this one, I'd like to hear your run-down on the Blake/Hunt massacre that happened in Pelham, AL.
YAY BAILEY'S BACK!!!!!! YAASSS❤️
I’m here early😍
Are we in Clue?.....
Absolutely love LOVE this look
Literally was like i miss Bailey then boom😭 made my day!!
We be waiting on these videos like biweekly checks 😭😭🤣
Oh my gosh! I just heard her say slapping meats, and the face she makes after saying that was hilarious. To be honest I've never heard of that term before.
In all the antiqueness haha
what are we in clue 🤣 ha ha ha im dead
Geee! Sounds like Lori Vallow and Chad Dumbell!
I live in the springs please come
What about an episode on the British Nanny who apparently killed a 9 month baby in her care in 1995? Girl from Cheshire, England and she moved to Boston and was looking after 2 boys with Doctor parents when their youngest child died in her care due to shaken baby syndrome or so they say......
Bailey Syrian  This look is so cute on you. Your eyes are amazing.😎
First off all girl I’m feeling those butterfly clips 💜 Also Thank you for gracing us with your presence. My Monday has purpose again. 😂
I live in Pueblo Colorado, about 45-60 minutes away. Bailey, it's beautiful here in Colorado. If you ever make it out here message me and I'll be your tour guide, and not like a Barbie tour guide. LOL 😂😂 I'm serious. It would be a blast. 😊❤️
As soon as you said Colorado Springs, I thought “ I wonder if it’ll be a Kenda’s case”. But what are the odds that as soon as you said Diane’s name I KNEW it was. Joe Kenda, the Homicide Hunter and my household’s favorite former detective, was in charge of her case. And solved it. Him and his team, I don’t want to leave out the rest of the gang. I can’t believe Reali and Brian got parole.
I have missed you! I hope you had a great break🥰
# Netflix give this woman her own series.  💗💗💗
Greets from Germany 🇩🇪… I love you ❤️
just because brian didn't pull the trigger doesn't mean that he wasn't involved
"I got miracles to do..."  ME, a pagan, sobbing while laughing 😂😂😂
So glad you posted a new video!! I saved it to, to put on the sound bar for me and my co-workers that work 3rd shift with me. Love your videos and podcasts 🥰
How sad for him to have done all of that to his wife to have his kids end up without both of them. They were both equally to blame
As a Lupie (the cutesy way of saying "I suffer from Lupus") myself, I appreciate your brief summary of what Lupus is. It is a very misunderstood and devastating disease. Thank you for giving a kind and accurate description. 😊 🖤
Can we have some bloopers?
Hair clips !👀
Happy New Year!  Thank you for continuing to do mmm even though since it’s blown up you’ve gone onto bigger things also. A lot of work but much appreciated! Better to be busy doing what you love than a job ya hate anyhow:) Hope you never get burned out and continue to enjoy these!
this one hits sort of close to him since i live right by springs and go to church there 👁👁
Sounds like they were trying to frame Ben for it, and that was going to be their way of getting out of it.
can you please talk about Lyle and Erik Menendez, please )
Congratulations on 6K beautiful 😍
The way jennifer is smiling in her mugshot
What happened to Brian and Diane’s three children?  Welcome back Bailey.
SHES BACKKKKKK
As someone who lived in Fort Carson for like 3 years. 😑 the cheating still goes on there. So sad she lost her life because of that .
Yay 6M 😎
I think Joe Kenda covered this case or was a part of it. I swear I’ve heard this one before.
“Bryan come on in” 😂😂
i was born at fort carson LOL
I lived for “look, look you little kitty cats” 🤣🤣🤣
I miss you 😭
Bailey! You should cover the Donner Party or Miracle Flight 571 on Dark History! Or the atrocities at Abu Ghraib. Or Vlad the Impaler! Or the discovery and controversy surrounding streptomycin! OR the Natalie Wood case! So many crazy stories out there!
As soon as she said “it wasn’t the husband” I was like “he had a mistress and she killed her lovers wife and he made her think it was her idea” Later in the episode Bailey confirms 🤣🤣 I’m too obsessed with these
"Slapping meats" 😂😂  I'll just leave that right here!!!
I have Lupus and it's not fun😳🤔🙏🙄
I love you mom
The shells stay in the gun on a Revolver.
Thank you for explaining Lupus, you explained it perfectly 🥰  RIP Diane 🦋💜
Currently watching this video while being Stationed at Fort Carson In Colorado Springs 😭… YIKES Gotta love the stories though !
Bailey: “every part of his clothing..” Me in my head: “ ginch too?”
SHE’S BACK!!!!! *Screams* 😆😆😆
I'm spending my law school vacation catching up on all the videos you uploaded during the semester. I just finished yesterday so I'm so happy to see a new upload todaaaay
I always wonder when she talks about a story where the people involved are still alive, if they ever do see this... could you imagine... could you imagine!!! hahahaha
Bailey you’d love manitou springs / Colorado Springs !!! Halloween they go all out 😍
Congratulations on 6 million Bailey ❤️loads of love from India 🇮🇳
Happy New Year Bailey
Finally 😭❤️
“SLAPPING MEATS TOGETHER” 😂
I have Lupus and it is a bad disease. Love you Bailey!
I laughed so hard at so many points during this one!!! My boyfriend enjoys listening to Bailey too... I watch while he's playing PlayStation so he hears the stories too.
Can you please talk about the death of Princess Diana and the royal family?
Gabby Petito…
Bailey‘it’s not the husband’ ends up basically being the husband 🤣🙈
Im so happy you're back ☺️
I had a really horrible night And needed this, thank u.
Girl I’m from Colorado Springs…it’s not small anymore lol and yes military and crackhead galore lol
Or Martin Luther King
You should do one on Christopher Columbus
I think Brian is hanging with Diane’s family
Bailey: “So today’s story takes place in Colorado Springs”  Me:*watching from Colorado Springs*  👁👄👁
6 million  Bailey  real quick!!!
Colorado Springs is SO not a cute little town. It’s a nightmare lol. No hate! I love the shopping and mountains there. But driving there from Canon City, and the drivers there are so annoying.
congrats on your 6m subscribers!!!!! you inspire me to create my youtube channel love you alotsssss bailey
🤚🍖  slappin meats🥩 ✋
Me reads the caption: IM BACK Me: OH YEA BABY
🤔 They both should have been charged equally, I think 🙄 hi Bailey! Happy 2022! 💚💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
“Oooooo Jenniferrrrrr” 😜
Hi Bailey! first off I LOVE you're videos! I've been on a binge watching all of them while i've been quarantined, they always keep me entertained. And secondly, I wanted to see if you could cover the story of a little boy named Gabriel Fernandez. It is a very hard story to talk about, but I feel like more people need to know the consequences of not taking a childs cry for help seriously. Social workers failed him, his mother and step father failed him. It is a tragic story but I feel it's important to share. Keep it up to get the names of these horrible people out there and to keep others safe! Love you<3
Just wanted to say thank you Bailey. The Colt Peacemaker was used by some very famous folks like ,Wyatt Earp, Billy the kid, and Doc Holliday all used Peacemakers at different time. So I believe they are a very sought-after gun.
Ben was TOTALLY meant to take the fall for this. She wore HIS clothes, dumped them where they could be easily found WITH key evidence of the "robbery" AND she begged him to TAKE THE GUN BACK???? MA'AM. 🤨
"Slapping meats"  I busted out laughing. Oh Bailey, you've got such a way with words 😆
I read that Colorado Springs is considered a rather "Christian" city.
Can you do a story about the human zoos
Why are they smiling so much in their mug shots?!
Yay I love your videos my birthday was like three days ago
Bailey: *whispers* ✨Science ✨
Hi Bailey, I'm one of your biggest fans, I'm so excited that your BACK!!! I got some of your Suspish merch for xmas, I was so excited. Very comfortable 😌 I CANT wait for an episode. I would like to recommend a true crime story, the story about The Hart Family. There is a documentary about the story called Broken Hearts, you should check it out!! I would like to hear your break down of the story as Always!!! You Rock Girl, I loved your hair btw!!  Lol 😆 ❤
what a great way to start my day
Yay!!! Welcome back ♥️♥️ I missed you 🥺🥺🥺
Happy New Year! I won't tell anyone if you don't!
Welcome back Bailey 😊
Bailey! Happy freaking New Year! I hope your holidays were amazing! I was wondering, as a suggestion, would you be willing to do a behind the scenes on how you collect information on your stories? Maybe do a case you have already done and just do a walk through of your research?
I think Lt Joe Kenda did this case on his show on ID. I knew i heard it before. Lovedddd the makeup Bailey 🥺✨❤️
She’s back!!! 🙌🏻❤️
Google says “The peacemaker” The US army adopted the handgun in 1873 and named it M1873  When it was introduced to the civilian market 2 months later it was nicknamed “the peacemaker”
“Slappin’ meats” 😂😂
Okay but is your intro actually you saying "son of Sam" pls
I literally said Bailey Syrian where are you as I scrolled through my subscribe page, then I saw you uploaded a video 😄
Yeahhhh ...back to looking forward to mondays
Her smile in her mug shot 🙄
What is the foundation brush your using ??? Is that the hourglass one or the refer one ?! 🥲😍😍
Literally the cutest hairstyle ever!! I really love it on you!!
“It’s not the husband”  Me: then it’s a mistress  “It’s the mistress”  Me: yes, fbi I’m available to start work immediately  But really though, I think that Brian probably manipulated her, cause why else would she admit everything so quickly? Like if she did it all herself, wouldn’t she be more withholding? Idk that’s just a pattern that I’ve seen in true crime stuff.
WE MISSED U
I love the butterfly 🦋 clips. It's bringing me back to middle school/highschool 🤣🥰🌈💙💙💙
"Let's hope 2022 treats us right"   😬 not lookin too fetch
Luka Magnotta case!
Brian would be a perfect cult leader
I love about an hour and a half away from the springs and let me tell you it is very high in crime!! And we all know how lifetime movies end haha
The Peacemaker was the genius of Samuel Colt and it helped to tame the Wild West. Didn't Sam and Dean Winchester also use a " Colt Peacemaker " on Supernatural? Just saying it is still a marvelous and effective weapon . I'd bet my life on a Peacemaker in the right hands . Not mine but someone's.
Colorado Springs people are built differently 🤷🏻‍♀️
Yay! Shes back! We missed you frand! All that matters is that your back. ❤️❤️
I think they are equally to blame!
Welcome Bailey, I missed you....
Listen Jennifart 💨
You have the most vivacious wonderful personality love you 😍 you make my Monday’s bright like 🌞 stay a u tuber forever you were born for this I don’t care what they say ha ha
Your hair tho ..... Thank you, I miss butterfly clips and 1997.  I love you, you're amazing. ♥️
Ayyyyeeee she’s back!!!!😝😝
Hi friend!!!!!!
Love the look today!!!! Beautiful 😍
Well Robert Durst is unalive so 2022 did one thing right so far
If you ever co to Colorado Springs hit up the Garden of the Gods, it's beautiful! And, yes both of these a*holes are equally guilty and deserved life. Thank you for doing lesser known cases! I honestly really enjoy them more than big cases.
Hello my Queen! 🥰
I think Bryan Charles mansonned Jennifer, because that's all Charles Manson did was manipulate people into doing what he wanted so if anyone deserves life in the pen it's Bryan
YOURE BAAAAAACK! ❤️
I keep getting mad at you for not posting just forgetting that you’re an actual human and have a real life. But I keep coming back!!!! Because I’m so obsessed with you. And I love you so flipping muchhhhhhhh
~•"Slapping meats"•~ That's the main thing I took away from this video, and im not really sure why.
Super creep, he’s a super creep, super creepy!! Seriously, those mug shots alone should have kept him in jail.
Congrats on 6 million!!!! WE LOVE YOU
I was diagnosed with lupus back in 2017. Its not a well known illness so it makes me happy hearing you talk about it!
Maybe Ben gave her the peacemaker just in case she planned to use it on him so that it would be easier for the authorities to determine that she did it!  🤔  He had to realize it was sus that she all of the sudden wanted protection…
I never understand why there's not only a witness but witnesses, and nobody really tries to stop the gunman. I understand it's scary. And I understand that the 911 system was made because people tend to just watch or go with the crowd. But with so many witnesses not one person was willing to do anything? Makes it even so much more heartbreaking.
They both got off easy, including Jennifer. I hope Brian's family came to their senses and kicked him to the curb.
Bailey, girl, I have missed you! Welcome back. How was your holiday? Hope it was rockin. Happy New year 🎊. Looking forward to seeing all your new videos coming up in 2022. Wow! 2022. How the years fly by. 😳 .. Have a great rest of your week ❤️.
I absolutely adore Bailey’s personality. Watching true crime videos usually makes me sad but not hers. It feels like I’m on Facetime with my friend.
I love all your stories! I let them build up so can binge watch them! Please get a tie dye hoodie out please, just like the shirt!! Thank you for somebody, and something to enjoy when you don’t enjoy yourself sometimes!! Thank you Bailey!!!
I live in Canada so hearing: “this isn’t your typical gun where you’d like go into a Walmart and pick it up really quick” …it’s like super weird for me to wrap my head around how EASY it is to get a firearm in the states!
Ahhhhhhh
I looked for slappin meats from Genesis to Revelation... no mention.
I heard Colorado Springs and jumped. Don’t come, you won’t like it. 😂
Baileyyyy congrats on 6mil like what the heck?!?! Been here since 2 mil!!
None of these adults even thought of their poor kids ckdjhchd
Ant farm cult
6M Congrats Bailey!!!! Been here since late 2020 and it's amazing to see how fast your channel grows ❤️
It’s my birthday and she posted😆😆yayyy I’m sooo excited ❤️
If you're a new subscriber I wish I was you ..I'd be watching bailey's videos all a new😭🥺
Big hair bailey .. AHHH GET IT
IVE BEEN WAITING BAILEYYYYYY
Can you do a video about the girl that was abducted and locked in a box for 7 years???
Yay! I'm so late but I'm watching now 💜🥰
Love the hair and makeup. Hope you had a great holiday!
Happy New year 🥳🥳🥳
BRAVO
This is the best Monday night you've done in a minute guhl.
Bailey! Cover the Heather Strube case from Snellville, Ga!
It's so weird because these parents are like my parents age. Like my parents graduated in '90, and it's like seeing my parents in prison
I’m in Arvada , Colorado . Born in the 90’s . I was told about this story later in life . My  grandmother was friends with Diane back in the day.
Could you do a video about Amy Lynn Bradley?
It takes two to tango so, yeah they both deserve to go down for it.
Yay!! Bailey is back!!!!
I love Bailey!!
Do the Jacque Waller case please!!!
I love the butterflies clips!! So 1997?
Love, love, love this soft, neutral glam look. Fascinating story, I think they’re both equally guilty personally, terrible people.
We need a hair tutorial though lol
Yay!!!! The first “Nay Nay” of the new year! Annnndd while I’m wearing my pink suspish hoodie too! Love it!!
I missed you
You hit 6 million Bailey!!!!  So happy for you <3  Way to start 2022!!!
You are so hilarious I just effing love you! 😂😂 I was supposed to shower 2 hrs ago but then you dare come through my feed!😂💜
I’m a little over an hour from the springs… 👀 so yes.. please come here 😍
Most people going into the insurance business are encouraged to insure their family.  I think he was guilty anyway.
Dr Quinn! That’s all I will say.
CONGRATS on 6 million subscribers Bailey,very well deserved..Happy 2022 ❤
Me looking at reports of "delracron" variant in Cyrus and nearly a million cases a day here in the US hearing "Hope 2022 is great" 😒😭👀
Is she smiling in her mugshot? 😕 that's... interesting.  Edit. OK his smiling mugshot just popped up. These people are whackadoo
I NEED TO KNOW HOW SHE DOES HER HAIR IT LOOKS STUNNING MS. BAILEY HAIR TUT RN!!!
"Slappin meats"🤣😂
BAILEYYYY I MISSED YOU SM!! ❤️🥰   But sooo v happy you took your break. Happy new year!
i missed you so much ❤️
My family is from there.. It is beautiful and my mom and dad met there when he was Station there.. I was born there..
I love your hair and makeup in this video soo much
I know it’s fictional but would LOVE for you to talk about Willliam Afton of Five NIghts At Freddyie’s (FNAF) ♥️ happy new year!!!
Thank you bestie for uploading this I needed a bedtime story! ❤️
We missed you bailey
Another great session! Any updates on Ben???
I saw ASU and freaked out lol I was born and raised in San Angelo, TX and got my undergrad degree from ASU!
Congratulations on 6 MILLION subscribers! Wowza! SO happy for you!
Missed opportunity to use the old throwback "Bennifer". For shame, Bailey. For shame.
please make an episode on Shelly Knoteks' story because it's one of the most terrifying stories I've read about. SHE IS GETTING OUT OF PRISON THIS YEAR. people have to know about her to be careful. Her victims are frightened and afraid she will commit the same crimes again. This story didn't get enough media attention and it's absolutely sickening
How many times Bryan was said  in this video 🙃
Cover the John Allen Rubio case from Brownsville, TX!!! It’s so heartbreaking
Girl i'm watching from Belgium and I NEED THESE CC'S!
Bailey please can you cover Josef Fritzl 😭😭😭😭 if you see this lol
I live there and it's amazing here and I have never heard of this story so thank you!
Uf I love you
i love u
I just got extremely excited!!! Yay!!
At the start, talking about Lupus, I can only think of Selena Gomez.. I pray she is doing well.
Wait ! Bailey. What did they have to do with intent when they stood over her ?
Lol “‘what in the time travel is going on here.”
It's Balvira!  Three sets of horns and the other familiars.
Please cover a prison break story 😭
Hay Bailey, you should talk about the Ashley Pond and Miranda Gaddis case. It's really interesting.
Home with covid, made my night better.
Bailey: "Colorado Springs today has a population of about 500,000."  Me: "Bailey's talking about ME 🥺"
Bailey's back 🖤 In the meantime I've been binge watching 💜THAT CHAPTER💜
🖐🖐 has lupus 🖐🖐
I think you should do a video on the case of David Brame and Crystal Brame.
There both evil but he got off way to easy
Bailey!! I’ve missed you!!! I feel like I haven’t seen my bestie in so long and she’s finally back!!! (Ok, I lied, I’ve watched dark history… but still) I feel whole again🥰
Missed you Bailey 💕
Yay I’m so glad you’re back, missed you so much 💗💗💗. Please don’t change the background I love it 😍😍😍
I saw this on an episode of Homicide Hunter. It was a crazy story.
ITS MONDAY!
They should have gotten the same time
Please do one on Amanda Knox!! It’s SO controversial
I don’t think anything makes me more disgusted than people smiling in their mug shots.
Jennifer…Jenniferrrrrrr…JENNIFERRRRRRR
“Slapping meats together” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I've never heard the term "slapping meats together" hahaha. Also, I have lupas and I'd much rather get divorced and heart broken then be well, f*ckin dead....💔
Your makeup this time though is EVERYTHINGGGGGG !!!!!!
When you showed his recent mugshot I was even more scared
Yayy I'm so happy she's back! 😭❤
Humor humor, all the more reason why I love watching you talking about true crime while doing make up ♥︎♥︎♥︎
I used to LOVE Bailey, I’ve watched every single one of her videos, but after listening to a bunch of other true crime you tubers over the past months I’ve realized how out of touch with reality Bailey is. Even though her and I are the same age I feel like I’m listening to a 15 year old tell a story. She’s very self centered and doesn’t realize there’s life outside her little bubble.
I'm about 30 min from Colorado springs and  it's so wired to hear a story so close to home my city has way more horrible stories tho
Hi Bailey! Love from Japan! Have you heard of Zackary and Andrew Bagby? It would be awesome if you can read about them. Thanks!
Slapping meats 😂
I think Brian should've got the same sentence as Jennifer. It's so clear that he was just as guilty, and only let Jennifer pull the trigger so that he could have a defence. The life insurance policy really says it all.
“You should go back to prison, sorry about that 😊”
The fact that you can say "slappin meats together" so casually and straight faced just makes me wanna be best friends that much more 😂😂😂
All I want is a  video with Bailey and the boys from Watcher
Jesus loves you and is coming back ❤️
Bailey,  the ruby ring your engagement ring?
Yeah, they should have both got life w/o parole. Men are so convincing but as soon as the plan goes south all the sudden he was CONTROLLED by a woman, or it was all her idea because we all know how much men let women tell them what to do back in the day. He should have got the same as her.
All hail ✨Bailey fricken Sarian ✨
The BFF ❤️. How I missed you!
I am currently in labour. Contractions for the last 23hrs. Sat in a bath tub to try and ease my pain. But honestly watchin this stuff is takin my mind off it so much better 🤣
When it's "a crime of passion" for some reason they are less likely to have to carry out full sentences and are more eligible for parole and so on and so forth.
Your hair looks AMAZING  First thing I noticed 💚🖤💚🖤
I would love to hear about Israel Keyes! Such a fascinating story.
“Slapping meats” 🤣☠️🤣☠️🤣
Perfect thing to watch when doing a spa night ❤💆‍♀️🧖‍♀️
So happy to see your beautiful face back! But I’m glad you enjoyed and had a break ❤️
They both have to pay for their crimes But no. Nay nay. Missed you!
Where even does a personality like Bailey's come from ? lol
Bailey please cover Shelly Knotek.
I got sick 3 days ago so it’s been a weird year already lol
Amanda Knox next week?
I really like the way you thoroughly research your subject
Okay but I’m like fangirling every time you say my home towns name 🤣🤣 Colorado Springs has a lot of messed up stuff
Concealer, concealer, concealer....girl, you only needed that first one. Lol
Honey I’m so glad you had a wonderful break!!! Your hair is always gorgeous 🤍
my toxic trait is watching MMM when going to sleep so i have to rewatch and figure out where i left off for about 3 nights until i finally finish the episode
Not me having a panic attack when she said Colorado Springs like this is a new crime lol.   But yes Bailey come visit The Springs. It’s BEAUTIFUL here.
6 million Bailey WOW ❤️❤️❤️
I had a monday of mondays , your vid’s are nice way to decompress after a rough day,  welcome back ! 🤗
The fact that they are both smiling in their mug shots is unsettling!!! 😳
Whispers *silence* 👁👄👁
All I can think about is the kids in both these families 🥺
Each new background can you do and I focus tour so we can see it in all its glory
FYI, Everyone in Colorado Springs owns a gun, but the 1812 Peace Maker is incredibly rare.  I'm from the area, nearly all my life.   The local attitude from the start was that she did it.  No one bought the " just friends" claim either.
I’m sick w covid & I’ve had 2 kidney transplants in the past so I’m on 20 day quarantine instead of 5 bc I’m immune compressed. Thank you for uploading ❤️ I’m rewatching all your videos. Love you Bailey!!
My moms name is Jennifer and my dads name is Brian so this was so weird to listen to. I also just listened to the case of Rebecca Zahou and my name is Rebecca and my boyfriend’s name is Jonah 😵‍💫😂
Those 2 were as bad as one another. They both should have remained in jail. Planned together, life insurance on Dianne, Jennifer actually pulling the trigger. He thought he could get away with it putting all the blame on just Jennifer. What a total loser. Shame on both of them.
I got that shirt for myself and daughter in law.  Love it.  And the nay nay socks are the best.
I'm wearing your suspish hoodie, doing cardio, and watching this 👐
I wish I could do my make up like that!
Do a video about "the lady of the lake" lake crescent her body turned to "soap:
Hi Bailey suggesting the Colorado man who killed his wife and two toddler girls in 2018. The wife also had lupus, I forgot the name of the story but there’s a doc out on Netflix now
Jennifer got karma slapped in the face. Brian I wish had the same karma. Neither one should have ever seen the light of day in my opinion. I feel bad for the children. They didn't ask to have their mom taken in such a violent way and well the dad did it to himself
This was kinda lame. But Bailey tells it in a way that turned it to be interesting.  But the case was meh...
Finally🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
"2020 too!"
I live in Colorado Springs and I can safely say that owners of antique gun collections account for over 60% of the population.....
Your ability to tell a story and hold one’s attention has gone downhill.
Have you ever researched Truddi Chase? Take a look, it will curl your toes.
I don’t think you have done an episode on Peter Sutcliffe, but that story is a doozy!
Should have had equal sentences
Everytime Bailey said “Jennifer” I looking over my shoulder for my mom and thinking what did I do?
Could you do a video on patrizia reggiani?
I honestly get so excited when you go on breaks, you’re personality is always so bubbly and funny asf when you come back!! “Straight execution”
I suffer from lupus and your description was spot on. I'm so glad you're back bailey.  You are queen. Love you. ❤
5 kids affected by parents actions.  Sad!
11:05 this screams "THAT'S SO UNCOMFORTABLE TO SAY OUT LOUD!!!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Welcome back,Bailey!
I was freaking out to my fiancé that you were back with a new video and he laughed at me lol. I’m so excited!
Lolol the face she made at the beginning
Bailey said slappin meats… Me: spit my wine everywhere 🤣🤣🤣
~~ What's up with the smiley face mugshots @ 31:13 & 31:47??????
Yayyy! Baileys back, happy New Years! 🎉
it’s not cute and it’s not charming 😂
I know one thing for sure: I would DEFINITELY sign up for a Day on the Shooting-Range w/ Bailey.😁👍🎯🔫
Miyazawa family mystery!!
WOW‼️ I CANT BELEIVE THEY BOTH PAROLED‼️
Starting 2022 with Covid boo!!!! I’m so glad you’re back Bailey ❤️
Congratulations gal,just saw you made 6mXx!!!
I GO TO ASU!!!! lol that's wild. You should do another cannibal episode.
I spit out my protein shake when Bailey said ASU. I attended ASU ny freshman year and had to transfer after a stalker incident.
I’d love to have a coffee with Bailey and talk and laugh. She is so precious💕
I’ve been missing you!
Welcome back missed you and your stories.and makeup tips
Sounds like a certain Idaho couple.
One of my favorite makeup looks on you!
"Slappin' meats together ".  I'm deceased,  my spirit has left my body. 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
That theme song is really evolving!!! Yes girl!!! 🙌😂
Yay great to see MMMM back
I’m loving the extra sass in this episode 😍
💖💖💖💖
Id love to see you do one on the Ward Weaver Case. Oregon City 2002
I think it would be so cute for her and Stephanie soo  to collaborate on these topics, exchange theories, perspectives ❤
I’d just like to take a moment to appreciate the fact that you -Bailey Sarian - now have 6 million followers. Are you aware that that is roughly 5 times as many as Paris Hilton?? Never before would that have been possible without YouTube. I love it, and hate its censorship all at the same time lol
Robert Durst - please do him. It would be so great. He just died in prison.
Gives her that gigantic gun?   Not exactly a ladies weapon.
Love your honesty!!!
Moment for the hair gorgeous 🦋🦋🦋
i love thesee
Oh man, those butterfly clips are taking me back to middle school in the 90's! I could _never_ put them in right, but all the popular girls had them perfect every day.
can u talk about son of sam and hillside strangler...i love stories like jefree dahmer coz im 😭
Theme song twist! Woot! 😂
Great episode
this lewk is everything!!!!!!
What is your hair regimen girl??
My name is Jennifer, I felt like I was in trouble every time you say “JENNIFER”. Haha🤣😂
Where are u getting guns at in Walmart😂😂
Odd to say after slapping meats 👋 🥩   🤣 😂 haha 😛 ☠️ I’m done 👌🏻
Your eye look is SO beautiful!
So glad that you're back! Hope you had great holidays😇 Day 15 of  asking you to do the Elliot Rodgers story🤘🏽 Full of love from Quebec🥰
OMFG YOU'RE ALIVE
Hi Bailey! Welcome back! Missed you! Hope you had a wonderful holiday!
Bailey! My partner and I love you! Would you please do a MM&M on Brian Shaffer? He walked into a bar and never walked out. His story is crazy and no one knows what happened. Thanks ❤️❤️❤️
Your hair is ADORABLE Bailey!!!
Bailey we missed you bestie 😭🤧💞
They both should have been in prison for life imo. Happy new year girl! Love to see you back!
Congrats on the 6 million sub
i have lupus and u explained it so welllll
Butterfly clips!!!! <3
I love this woman - to my core
Way too much time for Brian, but then again , the justice system in the US favors women
My mom's maiden name is Hood was weird hearing the name.
My Isolation days are much better with uploads from Mike, Eleanor and Bailey! I love it!
Hey queen thanks for uploading 💕
Why do they look so happy in their mug shots??
Just wanted to say I'm a teacher and I got some really frustrating news regarding work/covid but seeing you uploaded a new video truly helped lift my mood <3
I think they were both as guilty as each other and both should have got life sentences
I really think is called the peace maker bc you have enough time to pray before you get shoot again and die
Enjoyed this one. Just like all the others. Consider doing the story of Zack and Addie from New Orleans.
New tattoo?
U need to do the devil made me do it Case!! I know there’s already a movie about it but I feel like you could give more accurate information :)
i hope u know i sing along to every theme song thx ily
He sounds pretty sceevy and his creepy smiling picture..I think he got away with too much. He sounds extremely narcissistic.
Wow 6M followers for you Idol Bailey.keep it up i love all your videos and as always your theme song always rock🤘. I also enjoy your Dark history videos  Lots of love from the Philippines
Bailey! So glad you’re back! My gma and I watch you ALL the time! She suggests you do a story time on Frank Jarvis Atwood of Arizona! Thank you!
I love you
Lupus is a real disorder that gets brushed aside too often (thanks to media and “House”).  Be very kind to those that have it. They are fighting a battle that they are praying you will NEVER have to understand. Also, I got so wrapped up in her storytelling that I MISSED the makeup; which is fabulous! Rewind. Watch again with no sound now. Will NEVER be able to recreate, but maybe l will learn a trick or two!
What in the time travel is going on right now😂😂😂fave bit🤣
# Colorado native
my partner thinks im crazy cause i say goodmorning to you and talk back to ya like were having a convo in ur intros hahahah
You hair is super cute.!
Do the case of Shanda Sharer and the case of Stacey Hanna.
Literally looking forward to Bailey Sarian all year!
It's like getting bak to the old bailey! The intro was a lil weird tho
I just ordered that shirt along with the mug 😁 so excited to get it!!!
Bailey is a savage 😂😂😂 Love your delivery of these true crime video 😂❤️
Happy New Year! Welcome back! 🎉  They both should have been given life sentences and never been released! 😠
I am not against any religion, I am catholic but it surprises me as always it must always see a crazy extremist who pretends to be "religious" and who must distort religions with his sick mentality and leave people who only want to profess their faith in a normal, calm way and without affecting third parties with bad appearance in front of society.  What a shame... What a story🤯
I don't know if it's karma however if you have pancreatic cancer you only have a 1% chance of living I just lost my grandma to pancreatic cancer.
I missed youuuuuu thank youuuuu
Missed you Bailey boo!
Do a video on Jeffrey MacDonald
Yeah exactly Jennifer is just as much of a manipulative b**** like I said she was absolutely attempting to shift all the responsibility onto her f****** husband how evil is that b**** sick sick twisted f****** w****
I missed u so much ಥ‿ಥ
Slapping meats together?? 🤣🤣
I lived in Colorado Springs for a couple years; I loveeeed it there. Can’t wait to go back
So happy you're back!! I think the Lacey Spears case is super interesting 🤔 😀
What a sad story
I have never requested you to do a specific video but I would love you to do Alexander Kinyua. Just watched a 20 min video about him on signs of a psychopath S3E5. Definitely interesting
SOOO glad MMMM's are back!!!
Great story! Welcome back I missed you!
Colorado Springs, last I checked, was primarily Air Force. I visited for a few days in '98 (age 8), but my mom lived there a couple of times in the 70s and early 80s as the daughter of an Air Force officer. The Air Force Academy is a big deal and an impressive campus - especially the inside of the chapel building (last I knew, they might've changed it).
Not in pain? Lol ok
Girl your hair here is EV👏ERY👏THING👏. The clips. The waves. 🤌*Chef's kiss*  Love your videos Bailey, thanks for making Mondays worthwhile!
A happy birthday to me! I get to watch Bailey! 💜💜
My nephew will be 3 in March and he just learned how to make the noise you do in your intro. I saw him Sunday and we just kept doing it back and forth 😂
super excited to see this today!!!
We miss you so much ...can you please show us more how do you make those fabulous techniques for your eyeliner please. ❤❤
Thank you for describing lupus. I have been living with it for almost 6 years now and it amazes me how little is known about it in the general population so talking about it on your platform is so awesome 💜
PLEASE DO ARIEL CASTRO AND AMANDA BERRY
So glad you are back!
From Colorado Springs (unfortunately) and I’ll tell ya, it’s not nice. Cute. But not nice
Can you do an episode on Charles "Chucky" Foresi...he killed my Aunt Pauline in Roseli, Michigan. I would LOVE to see what you can pull up because the cops never really gave us the full story as why he did it and he was kind of "crazy" so we can't believe a word he says. It would mean the world to me if you did an episode on that for me. Love you! Oh! Finally got my Suspish beanie and coffee mug in and I absolutely love them!
Living in the springs honestly you described it perfectly 😭. It’s a little creepy though as well and deep in the mountains
I love this!  Also I kinda want you to take up Miriam Rodriguez! they say she's irl Taken so i think i'd be great!
I like how your shirt is written in Suspiria font. <3
The moment you said Colorado Springs my heart dropped. I grew up there.
I missed you Bailey!!!
We love you Bailey.
I love how you do your entry I always try to do it with you! I’m not hating you mix up as much as you like babe but my best part is listening is  saying intrusion together, I’m just one person so don’t worry still love you ❤️
As much as it's nice to put on makeup YOU my friend are gorgeous without makeup and don't let anyone tell you different. And I'm not saying to stop putting makeup on, I'm just saying that you can rock it just as easy as when you do put makeup on! I love your content and keep rocking it!
Hey Bailey I just want to let you know that i am 52 years old and i recommended you to my niece who is 20 years old and she also watches you and she was chocked that an old women like me also watch and love you :) I found that funny. Happy new year 😁😁😁 Best wishes from the nordic countries.
So glad ur back!! 😁❤️
She’s back!!
Can you actually just buy a gun at a Walmart? Isn’t that a Supermarket? I find that completely crazy.  I know you can buy guns in America but seems so odd if you can just buy them at a food store….
Rewatching this and the beginning when she says "locals that work at flower shops" 😂😂😂 Baileyyyyyy
Yep you had me at the butterfly clips 😍😍😍 welcome back
Ah! Bailey i missed you so much 😭 been waiting for your fantastic story telling girl!❤✨
i like how he doesnt wanna get a divorce but he would rather disobey FOUR of the 10 commandments
Bailey ..I love that you are missing one polished nail..lol.. your so beautiful,  you make it work. 😁🤣
A great big shout out for Bailey's hair!!!
Bailey (an empath) sensing Dianes in pain after being shot
Ooo yess, I missed this!
bailey: colorado springs is a nice. charming area.   me, who lives there: *absolutely not*
I live in Springs and don’t see anything cute and nice about it nowadays
How did he even become a CHURCH leader when his theology was that fallacious???
YAAAS BAILEY IS BACK!!  My Mondays just got a whole lot better!
I love that people think 250,000 people is a small town. I grew up in a town of 2300 people and it was the biggest small town in our area so people from even smaller towns would come to us for groceries and stuff 😂
Currently sick w/ covid and having to quarantine with my boyfriend making him watch this video on the Tv with me lol 😝
Bailey I have a picture of me and my friends going to our first Third Eye Blind concert in about 1998 with me in THIS HAIRSTYLE 🦋🦋🦋🦋🥰
I will never grow tired of Queen Bailey!!! You should do the Giggling Granny story!!
I love you! Your makeup skills are awesome! They were gonna get rid of Ben!
How is 250k a small town
Glad you're back! 🎉👏💜🔥
So happy you’re back!
Chalino Sanchez
I enjoy both of your podcasts! I look forward to Mondays and Thursdays 😁
This is the year ladies! We have to start slapping each other out of these toxic, narcissistic, abuse relationships with these men that treat us less than and brainwash us!!
SIX MILLLLLYYYY 🥳🥳🥳
Why are these people smiling in their prison photos???
Bailey can you pleaaase do a Q&A one day? 😊🥰🤗 P.S. LOVE the hair girlfriend! 🦋
The extra theme song note made me laugh super loud....
I love your little giggle
@25:57 😂💯😂😂😂
Welcome back Bailey 🥳 Happy New Year 🍾🥂
I don’t know what it is about your voice but it’s so soothing and can put me to sleep in seconds! I usually have to rewatch all of the videos bc I fall asleep half way through from hearing you talk 😅 But I absolutely LOVE your videos so much I can rewatch them all day, any day just from how much happiness it brings me to watch them! ❤️
I missed you
A revolver, which is the peacemaker, is easier to shoot than an automatic. The kick back is less especially for a woman.
Please do tell what color nailpolish you're wearing love it!
Why is it always the religious insurance salesman
25:42 Has great meme potential. Someone get on it!!😂😂
I love how comfortable she is with talking about this because she could get banned or canceled off of YouTube but she also doesn’t care because she wants us to be happy and this makes us happy
I always smile whenever I hear her sing the theme song haha
I believe the husband manipulated her all of the way! Anyone can be manipulated by the right person, usually an evil person!
Your hair IS soups cute!!! 🔥
I went to high school with her in Seattle. We were in marching band together. I first out about this watching A Current Affair. My jaw dropped. She was very popular in school.
I don’t think there was much manipulation. I believe they both just wanted to be together get money from the life insurance and get off scotch free. I mean look at there mugshots. Those people are not sorry for what was done.
Am i the only one completely distracted by the fact that her hair clips are vertical on one side but horizontal on the other side.  😄
So far 2022 has given me a full sickness and when I was just about recovered gave me a double ear infection... so
Can you do Diane Downs next?
I've been waiting on this ALL DAY!!!! HOLLA 🙌🙌🙌
BAILEY I MISSED U SOOOOO MUCHHHHHHH
Congratulations on 6 million subscribers
This made my day….. that is all
Look, ultimately even if she was manipulated into the plan to do this, taking the life was her decision. She could have shot her anywhere the second time. The other shoulder maybe? He said shoot her twice and that would have counted as twice. He wasn’t standing next to her threatening violence if she didn’t go through with it and also not to be dark but she also had the option of saying no thank you. Women in abusive relationships rarely take a life to be rid of it
Your theme song made my 5 month old giggle 😂
Bailey calling herself out at the beginning is why I trust her ❤
This made my Monday! Love you Bailey! Congrats on the 6 million✨❤️
Loving the 90’s supermodel makeup to go with the timeline in the story!
Bailey reads her 8th Grade Diary needs to come back!!
Beyb Beyb I went e gen lol
Oh look! A squirrel! 😊
man gotta love colorado lol i love living here
Bailey!! Can you please do the Fritzl case
Bailey “the police have the smoking gun” Me “literally” 😂😂😂
Why not just get divorced? I would be sad for my children if they lost a parent.
Happy New Year 🎉
There's a case of a boy named Gabriel Kuhn you might be interested in....
I love your background, can be spooky season all year! Hope you enjoyed your break and had a fantastic holiday and Happy New Year!!
I saved this video until my busy day was over so I can relax and watch ❤️✨ cheers
The best thing to happen in 2022 so far: Bailey's back. 🥳
In all seriousness though, I feel sorry for Dianne Hood. Imagine getting cheated on and having to go through the extreme difficulties of dealing/battling with an autoimmune disease (aka lupus). She had kids to look after as well. And this woman by the name of Jennifer Reali just had to take away her own life in cold blood just because she was coerced. I mean, clearly, Jennifer is NOT the only one at fault here. Brian had been acting very suspicious right from the start. Both Jennifer and Brian needed to be held accountable. Well, this case happened ages ago, and so I guess they probably did just that a while back. Dianne had so much to look forward to in her own life. And these selfish people just had to get in her way.
So excited you're back! But just as excited you were able to have time off to yourself to rest and recuperate.   Tell you what, this vid came at the perfect time for me...cause it's all about me 😉 I've been having a rough year healtwise already and today was pretty bad, so to see your vid really made my day!  That's all. Take care xo
Its bumping uglies..... not slapping meats Baily lol
The Colt Single Action Army is a single-action revolver handgun. It was designed in 1872 for the U.S. government service revolver trials of 1872 by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company and was adopted as the standard-issued pistol of the US Army in 1873 until 1892.  I actually have a snub nosed in purple lol
You looked extra cute today!
have you seen the "Last night in Soho"?... the story actually reminds me of some of your stories that you told us.
Come visit!
Your hair!!! And it’s my birthday and I get a Bailey upload??? What an amazing day 🎉
Welcome back, Queen! Hope you enjoyed your break
Wow I literally saw Bailey at 3 mil now she’s at SIX so crazy I’m glad this channel blew up ‼️
FIRST TIME I GET TO WATCH A VIDEO ON UPLOAD, I was watching from beginning to recent and finally caught up. I’m excited!! 🥺🥺💙💙💙
The fact that he’s got that Gary Bussey grin on his face in his last mug shot is reason enough to lock him up for life.
Can you do the case of Harmony Montgomery?
this made my day gorgeous as ever !
I loves you!
I can’t even like fathom 6 million people. I remember when you were in the 300ks😭 congrats Bailey! You deserve it.
Today's my birthday and this feels like a gift, so thank you Bailey!
I’ve watched almost all of these while in quarantine before realizing I hadn’t subscribed 🤣❤️ love these videos
😂Bailey you are so funny!, I mean this is not funny, but like you are, but not the case.. Okay you get it. "Why don't u do it yourself you lil Biaaacccthhh" I cracked 😂❤️
Please cover Israel Keyes next !! There's sooo much info on him and his story is INSANE
Missed you girl!!! I hope your break was awesome and restful!!!!
Hahaha “What in the time travel are we in now? Are we in Clue? 🧐HAHAHA
Ooo!  Colorado Springs in 1990?  Does that mean Lt. Joe Kenda was on the case?  No wonder it was solved so quickly; he's a legend!
Do you have a best friend? And do you find it hard to have friends
Well she did have lupus? Life insurance for that?
Bailey!!! Are you wearing butterfly 90s clips??
Bailey, could you please do the case of Anthony Sowell, aka Cleveland Strangler?? He killed 11 women in Cleveland, Ohio.
Hey I have that shirt too 😏
I’ve seen a few comments thanking you already but THANK YOU for taking the time to explain what Lupus is! 💜 I was diagnosed back in 2011 and although it affects millions of people, many have never heard of it. Thank you for bringing awareness and shedding some light on this very debilitating disease. 💜💜💜
Please look into Leeja Miller!!!! On yt she covers some of your stories!!
Thankyou Bailey.  Happy New Year😂🤗🎉
Recreating this hair style is my new years resolution
Adding here an appreciation note to baileys hair, yes girl you look stunning! That’s all 🤗✨
Yesssssss I live in Colorado Springs 🏔
I SO needed this today! :) Just spent the last of my savings at the veterinarian and got home to find that my fridge is kaput. All the food is spoiled. It's ok though! Sha na shay, sha na shay.... 🤣
Guess who's back, back again, Bailey's back, tell a friend
Welcome back Bailey!!!!! Missed you!!!
Theme song was on point today 😜
6 million subscribers ?  why ?
Can you talk about the disappearances of young girls in butte county, specifically Tatiana Dugger
Yay this makes my birthday so much better 💓 ☺
"I'm never prepared. I'm never prepared" I felt this.
Your hair is super cute.
# replay
I love your freakin’ honesty Bailey!!! Haha!!! 💗
Gorgeous makeup!
Thanks for the lupus shout out.
“Slappin meats together” 😭😭😭😭
Hi Bailey
Also…Why do Jen and Brian look SO friggin’ happy in their mugshots…😂
Ha my husband asked “Jenny, who is yelling at you!?” The way you say “Jennifer “ I feel like I disappointed you 😂
I think Jennifer should’ve known better regardless of what some guy was telling her. She decided to make that decision
Ben obviously did not read the part where King David did almost the same thing. Bruh. Please.
Sick that he is big time smiling in his prison photos. What an a##!
I bet he gave the gun to her to prevent her from being impulsive with shooting. I wonder if she was impulsive.
Yaaaay!!! I literally binged all of your videos. So happy to see you! I would say for the new year but *looking eye emoji*
Jennifer pullin a Molly ringwald and Bryan lookin like the dad from seventh heaven…
i live like 30 mins away from colorado springs and it is def not a cute little town
Woah, when you showed the first picture of Jennifer I thought it was Julia Roberts
Every time you said Jennifer I felt personally attacked
your hair is gorgeous
can you please do the Menendez brothers 🙏🏽🤗
Can you do a case on Kendall Francois? He worked in my husband school and Poughkeepsie New York. All the kids really liked him and would have never guessed except for he was a bit stinky. And that was because he lived in a house of horrors. Fred Rosen wrote my favorite book about him entitled body dump. I think only one other verse on YouTube has ever done in case about him. And even if you don't want to do the case on it read the book I love the book that could be just because I know all the places that it's talking about but it was just a great book.
I think they both should have gotten a life sentence, love ya girl!❤️
Yesssss Bailey is  back from her break!
Maybe do a video on Marvin Falitz? He was a pilot who crashed a passenger jet in 1994 because he was in a bad mood 💁‍♀️
It’s never Lupus…but it’s always the husband.
i m not getting married.
My daughter and I enjoy sitting she does her homework I crochet while we listen to you. We're from Michigan and there is a case we don't think you have done it's disturbing one it's about Tara and Steven Grant. Here in Michigan it was labeled slaying in the suburbs and I'm pretty sure it happened around 2008 February of 2008 anyways just a suggestion we love you keep doing what you do 💕✌️
Maybe the family stuck up for him because they wanted him to get out so they could have their own vigilante Justice 🤔🤭
Colorado Springs area is great!
I believe the brother might have been involved and was going to get some type of pay for sticking up for Brian, but I also believe they should have been equally charged because of the life insurance policy like come on that’s SUSPISH
I see an Audrey 2 in the background!!!!! ♡
Love this look its giving me Priscilla Presley vibes 🥰
I can agree and say we've all missed you
Brian...come on in! 🤣🤣🤣
I've had a horrible week and your intro literally cheered me up more than anything and made me laugh. Thank you angel ✌💖
❤️
Life imprisonment in Sweden is 18 years. Then they can be extended for 5 years at a time. So to hear how many years. Ducks in the U.S. can get just as shocking every time :o 😂
Not sure if you have because I go on a spree of watching your videos lol but one of BTK  Only for the fact of how long he was able to get by with it and his family never knew til he was finally caught!
I personally prefer revolvers because they are so uncomplicated, simple and easy to use. Just point and shoot!
Hey girl, hey
Love that the theme song is still going strong😂
Again, thank you for your stories!
Hey Bay! Awesome as always. I suggest you do some research and talk about some Peruvian cases: Caligula  Marita Alpaca Climaco Basombrío El asesinato de Banchero Rossi
I was born in El Paso county. My dad was stationed there.
Take breaks as often as you want Lady gonna watch as often as you are willing cuz gotta love ya I just watch my favorite Bailey stories again 😁
I loooove youuuuuu!
Please do on Vanessa Guillen!
Those butterfly clips 😍
Yes babe I love the hair oh how I missed you Bailey 🥰❤️
Bailey, you should talk about the Diane Downs story! Love your content. Glad to see you’re back. 💕
❤️
I think they were equally responsible.  However, I know that if I was on the jury, I would see very detailed evidence and it would be so hard to decide someone's fate.
25:38 this bit got me lol
Thank you Bailey for talking about lupus. I watch my mom suffer for a long time and not be able to be there for her two kids when I was a kid
Please do Philip Jablonski 🙏.
WE MISSED YOU!!! I absolutely LOVE that you don't like to lie🥺
Why is a Colt 45 called a Peacemaker? The U.S. Army adopted the new handgun in July 1873, naming it the M1873, and bought 36,000 revolvers chambered in . 45 Colt caliber. The revolver was introduced to the civilian market two months later, acquiring the nickname “Peacemaker.” In 1878, the Peacemaker was introduced in .Jan 24, 2019
Scandalous!
The family probably wanted the kids to still have a parent
Slapping meats together 😂🤣😂
Missed you!!!!
What happened to all of the kids from both couples??
Both guilty as sin!!
Watching your videos have made me better at make up thank you 😊 also love your videos you have an amazing energy ❤
Do an episode on the Nicole Vanderheyden case
As someone who has an autoimmune disease similar to lupus (Fibromyalgia) , thank you for explaining it so well! I feel so seen right now ❤😭 Love you Bailey!
Please never change your theme song
We HAVE to locate Brian now! We need an update!  He sounds like a narcissist and I’d know anything about narcissistic he’s portraying addictive obsessions with something or someone in his current like now (like religion then).  It could be working out, women, religion, etc but he definitely will portray similar traits to himself from 1990!
I really thought Brian was gonna come on out hahahahahhaha
For some reason, this one made me laugh more than normal lol.
You look like a real life bratz doll all made up like this and I mean that as the HIGHEST complement. 😍❤️🔥🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋
🤣 OK! I gotta share this,  first my husband and I love Bailey and we talk about her and the stories, well the other day he was trying to remember her name to tell one of our friends and all he could think of was the theme song..🤣 so he started doing it and OF COURSE! I knew what he meant and I said Oh! Bailey Sarian ♥️ and they was like,  what? Now they love Bailey too..lol.. 😍👍💯
Hey you
As soon as you said she was shot but not by her husband, it was a shorter slim “person” I thought…💭 husband was having an affair and he convinced his mistress to shoot her. How many times have we seen this happen?
You rock Bailey!!!
Bailey do my makeup for my new state I’d, a fully natural looking glow for men that hides all my flaws
“Are we in CLUE?” 💀
Look at my girl Bailey ,knowing about Guns.....💝💝💝
Literally a gun called peacemaker to shut people up..
Best version of "theme song" yet! Glad to have you back.
I don’t think anyone’s innocent in this situation. Honestly I don’t think Jennifer was manipulated. I think that he may have mentioned something or other to do with it but then they both took it and ran with it
Co springs is BOOMING.its no longer a small town lol.
15:10   "...and they go to the gym a lot; and they hang out in the gym jacuzzi...AS FRIENDS!"  My brain:  ....two bros...chillin in a hot tub~~...
5:25 It would take someone who is very evil to shoot 2 times and act the way you describe.  Execution!! Bc of this I do not believe she should have had a chance to get out. I couldn't imagine what she was thinking after 1 shot. That's scary!! Her screaming and begging to live.
Super late but here on Monday! Me singing the shanashaaaa out loud and then you said "if you're new here..." I think we stablish the ones who sang have been here for a long time.. love you and your content. Sending love from Ecuador gorgeous 🥰
It was Marty McFly from Back To The Future part 3. He was given a Colt Peacemaker.
When you said "Google it" my phone pulled it up!  Haha we must sound similar!!!!
The extra spice in the theme song today was much appreciated <3
Anyone else note how amused Brian seemed in his mug shots? That guy has zero remorse. I hope the kids are with her family.
I'm definitely  hoping 2022 is better for me! Love you Bailey!
I'm finally on the "my husband asked me to wait so he could watch with me" train
Id like a vid on Maury Travis tbh. He was a wild one.
So glad you're back. Missed you over the festive season. Hope you had a happy holiday. Questionable who was most to blame. She pulled the trigger, but it felt like he loaded the gun! Would love to see your take on the UK Sophie Lancaster case
ok I’m ok with you changing the background an all but PLEASE please don’t get rid of the theme song lol also LOVE UR HAIR!!!! so cute 😍
I think they could have gotten her life insurance because of her Lupus…
He wanted to make sure she couldn't shoot him.
Love ur hair Bailey. Cute.
50 seconds in.... im just gonna go ahead and click the like button. Lol
Love the more neutral look, and ypur hair looks super cute. I think Diane may have influenced the situation and was way more involved. She may even have been the one orchestrating the entire thing. Theres more thannone Christian man thats been lead astray by a pretty face.
Can you look into Tom brown case  from Canadian Texas? LOADS of drama involved.
I’m feeling for Ben, bc I’m sure when his ex wife was released early he slept with one eye open.  Even with the chemo.
Been watching MM&M for a while now and I’m still in love!! I admit I have nightmares some times, especially when it’s really graphic, but I keep coming back! I’m also addicted to Dark history now!   Bailey I’ve watched you grow from 300,000 followers to now 6 Million!!  You go girl! An inspiration to many! 😁
I’m at 13:41 & my guess is the lady the husband was having an affair with killed her
missed you girl <3
Lol... We can hope 2022... Mmmm 🤣🤣🤣
The Peacemaker was lawman Whyatt Earp's nickname for his revolver. He used it the OK Corral shootout in Toumbstone Arizona. I love Monday's.. I'll shut my face now so i can finish watching.
MISSED YOU!❤️
your hair is so beautiful
Love your hair like that! Really cute!
i literally love doing my makeup WITH you, like ughhh 🥺 you make me wanna doll myself up all the timeeee
Happy New Year!  Glad you are back, you were missed
6 MIL FINALLY!!! Congratulations, Bailey!!!
I love when we aren't even a minute in and you're going neuro-divergent on us... I support your choices Queen 👸
Bailey please do the story of Genie Wiley please please please. Love you bailey
Menendez brothers please
I am not sure if you have done this one yet, but there is Genene Jones was one of the nurses who killed during the time I was being born close to Kerrville Tx
I have lupus and it’s a awful disease
Where have you been? We’ve missed you. I had to listen to knock-offs until you returned
21:55  'After you got done slappin' meats together' hahahaha
Unless you get convicted of life WITHOUT parole you will most likely NOT send the rest of your life in prison. Sad but true. Most people don’t know that and then a few years later the persons is out on parole.
I was not expecting it when you said Colorado Springs and I felt like I was being watched because I’ve lived here my whole life 😅
Wait what brushes did you use🥰😭
.
First impression: your hair looks GORG.
I think they were hoping to frame Jens hubby. Love the hair Bailey....
@zedge Her theme song needs to be a ringtone ijs
If my family testified for my husband, I'd come back and haunt them. He kept telling friends he wanted her dead. He definitely had more into it then he was charged for
What’s up with these folks grinning in their mugshots?! 🤢 sick
I’ve been waiting for this for 2 weeks 😭😭 your the best Bailey!
why does this remind me of "no body, no crime" by t swift lol
10 million by the summer babyyyy.. Our girl is about to bLOWWW UPP
Love this make up look on you 😍
The “peacemaker” or any revolver doesn’t take that long to shoot you’re pulling back the hammer and firing it’s repetitive and can be irritating but it doesn’t really take long at all. Don’t get me wrong there are better guns to use but you get what you get 🤷🏻‍♀️
6 MILLIOÔ99999OOOOOOON
You should do a story on Oscar Pistorius. The South-African athlete who shot his girlfriend on Valentine's Day.
Yay!  I’m so happy to see you!
Loved the hair!!! And makeup & story of course!
Happy New Year Bailey! Love watching you! ❤️
Bailey is Back Babes!! Make Great Choices!! Love ❤️ to you all & Happy 2022!!
The hair clips are giving 90’s vibes and I’m here for it. 💕
“Yeah, Jen & Ben” 😂
Fast forward to end and hit replay to avoid dem ads
Missed you  Congrats on 6MIL !!!
Are we in clue? 😂
Bailey, I luv ya….. but, please do NOT make butterfly clips a thing again. 😂
Is she Like grinning like a maniac in her mugshots?! What!
Dude can we talk about the intro it never gets old!
Could u do a tutorial on a natraul makeup. Idk how to get the no makeup look
Why is your baby fingernail not painted,lol?
You leave for 3 weeks and you upload a 33min video! How dare you!? 😂😂😂 my heart 💔 glad you are back and safe ❤️
Can You do the Maddie Middleton case it’s so sad
Even my Shazam cannot find it! What is the name of the track Bailey uses in the end?
Thank gawd for you!!! After almost 2 years of avoiding COVID while being immune suppressed, it has caught up with me with a VENGEANCE and it is terrifying me. I needed to have you in my corner today distracting me. Bless you! 🥰
love this make up look
6 million yay!!! You deserve it babe!!! ✌️❤️
I would love to see you do a MM about Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong. She had masterminded a 2003 robbery plot in Pennsylvania that led to the bombing death of pizza delivery man Brian Wells. You can find the story on Netflix, it’s called Evil Genius. It’s a WILD ride, and I’ve been dying to hear Bailey’s take on it 👏🏻
Isn't there a gun called the "widowmaker" ???
IMO it takes two to tango and they both were equally guilty.  I was cracking up when you said “slapping meats”!  You are so funny! And your hair looks adorable! Glad you’re back, Bailey! ❤️👍🏼😁
Time for new year theme song
Happy for the upload I sooo enjoy these
can you talk about holly bobo
A revolver is the best gun to give your non-military wife in a house with 2 children for protection.  It seriously lowers the chances of a negligent discharge which could result in the death/ injury of the kids. Also,  love the softer look!
I know you're not going to see this comment cause you never read our comments but your storytelling has changed, and not for the better
Slapping meats 😂😂😂
I keep thinking about that song Jennifer 😂
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey
“Jen and Ben” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
GIRL those butterfly clips are bringing me back to 6th grade.
Welcome back love
9.40 am singapore time ... hello queen 👑👑👑👑
Pease love joy! Yay!! Lol
I’ve looked forward to hearing her voice since Christmas! Best birthday gift ever!💓
I would love to hear you talk about ANDERS BEHRING BREIVIK !!!! Nobody ever talks about him. He was an absolute monster and more people deserve to know what he did!!
Yaayyy Baileys back to save Mondays again🥰 Love your hair btw Bailey. You should do a hair tutorial for us!
Much Love from Colorado ❤💋 I lived there when this happened so why don't I remember this? Oh The Springs isn't a little town. It's more like San Bernadino in CA.
@Bailey- Please do one on the Menendez Brothers. 😉
Brian wanted that insurance money he wasn't worried about Jennifers husband. He did it he wanted her dead and he found somebody gullible enough to do it. He should be in prison for life.
So then I went and bought myself a colt .45 Called the “peacemaker” but I never knew why Shoots like lightning but it loads a mite slow  - Johnny cash.  Now I can’t get the song out of my head.
Today was a horrible day and seeing this made it absolutely all better. Bailey is always there when we need her most. ❤️
Bailey you are freaking  adorable.  Love ya gurl!😊
Welcome back and happy new year Bailey!
That Autoimmune Disease will get you.. I have Autoimmune Liver Disease, it's loads of fun 😏
people gone learn to leave that life insurance policy until afterwards.. 😶
Happy new year Bailey. Very happy you're back💕
Finally watching!! Best way to end my Monday night! I hope you had an amazing break Bailey
I was telling my fiance the other day that I was sad because Bailey hasn't posted in a while.. he said "what if someone turned her into the next story.... 👀"
When I started listening to this episode it was at 1k when it was over 20k 🤩❤️ Bailey you are definitely a MUST LiSTEN!!🤪🥳🥰
I'm loving the wavy look it's so you
Could you please do the JonBenet Ramsey case?
Say my name lol "jennifer"
💗💗💗
Peacemaker was the name of Wyatt Earp's revolver..
Hi your so awesome. I feel he should have gotten more time. He was a narcissist.
I MISSED YOU
"Chruch folks & flower shops" na Bailey Colorado Springs is tweaker city now 😂
WE MISSED YOY
Bailey is a mood. Like foreal 😂. “I did it ahhh” I do this every time I do my hair right 😂
7:05 (ish) I can’t imagine how she wouldn’t have been in pain unless she was shocky though…
250,000 is considered a small town? Bruh there's 4000 people where I live and it's considered a city
Best birthday present today! Seeing your face!!!
6 million 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽🎉🎉🎉
Bailey! Can you cover the Vanessa Guillen case? I love your stories!
BAILEY ARE TELLING ME RIGHT NOW THAT THE ONE TIME SOMETHING IS ACTUALLY FUNNY, YOU DIDNT LAUGH!?!?!?
I need to know about the powder in the brows. Did the gel go on after?
Bailey: “250,000. i guess it’s considered a small town..” Me: living in a town with 11,000 people 😬😂
really wanna make the intro song my ringtone hahah
Yayyy welcome back beautiful ♥️
Bailey you make Monday’s way better…thank you for sharing your amazing talent with all of us!!!  Wondering if you’ve ever considered doing MMM on Ariel Castro? I would love to hear your take on him.
My dear friend Kelly Rothwell would have celebrated her birthday yesterday. Killed by the boyfriend, but never been able to prove it. Please do her story. Ms. Grace is familiar with this.
Happy New Year 💕
those hair clips are the cutest!!! I like how they're not too small! I'm on the hunt!!!
Bailey: It was a peacemaker gun  Me: WYNONNA EARP
YAYYY YOU’RE BACKKK
WE LOVE YOU BAILEYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A video on Robert Hansen!!!!!
I love bailey sarian so much she did her homework. The background , the set up are through the roof 💯 for effort
"slapping meats"!!! 😂 😂 😂 I must say, I've never heard it described in that way!! 😂 The visual I get from "slapping meats" is two guys having a "sword fight" 😂😆😂😆 Not a man and woman 😂 But nevertheless, you had me rolling!!!  Thanks for the laugh and the story!!💕🥰
I knew this sounded familiar it’s one of Joe Kenda’s stories. I love that you’re telling it! 💕
❤️💜💜
💜💜💜
My question is: what happened to the kids?
I don't doubt Brian put her up to it, I don't believe that excuses her but men are truly privileged. I think the only way Dianne's family would believe baby Brian had anything to do with it would be if he were to outright say it, and even then idk.
Please talk about Joel guy Jr. He did some pretty messed up stuff to his parents
Both guilty… did you see his mug shots? He thinks he’s something!!
Christian Family Values at it again.
Lauren Spierer
This eye makeup was stunning on you. The liner, the shading color, the LASHES! Wow! Guuurl those butterfly clips and voluptuous hair...Stunning!
I thought I heard about this case that the couples hung out together and were friends?
Colorado Springs representing, used to be a safe city now it’s gotten bad
Six. Million. Subscribers. Congratulations 🎉
Its actually so fun to watch the makeup unfold along the way! Its like a nice side story you know what i mean!! 💕
Ooh yay Bailey is back for MMM Monday. Happy New year true crime and Bailey fans!
So happy your back!
Thanks for the updated definition of Lupus. I have it….just yuck. Thanks
Both should have gotten the needle.
YESSSSSS YOURE BACKKKKKK
Imagine a mystery show where Bailey is the detective 😍 obviously it would be part comedy bc she’s so funny 😊😊
hearing your city in a true crime video is always an odd experience
hair looks amazing 🙏
Hit man
I’m living for your hair today! How did you do it?
I went to Angelo State but in the early 2000s. Great college
"Super charming cute little town" A Colorado native that couldnt be further from the truth the springs are the boonies of Colorado the only real noticeable thing down there is the Broadmoor.
I’ve been waiting for what feels like an eternity for a new video release!!! Thank you! Love you ❤️
AUNTY BAILEEEEY I MISSED YOU SO MUCH GWORL
Bailey you should look into the Kevin Bacon case in Michigan it’s effed up!!! Brian should have served more time in this case for sure!! I just watched this story on the ID channel. What a shallow individual he is!
Why is she smiling in her mug shot??  That's gross.
"Hey there little kitty cats." 😁
Congrats on 6 million 👏
I'm so happy you're back Bailey! I've missed you! As soon as I saw that you posted a video, I was like yesssss! I love your video's and your personal opinions that you put in your video's. ❤
I know this hasn’t been done yet but I think it would interesting to go through all the info of the Chris Benoit case. It’s unfortunately upsetting but a lot of people don’t know of the details regarding the case and or family.
Happy New year 🎆🎊🎈 Queen 👑 B!!!!!!!
I think that you should get Lenny Kravitz to do you up your intro song. Yes your hair is cute!
I really want that Audrey 2😍😍😍😍
You could do a story on Linda Hazzard, the lady who, in the early 1900s, pretended to be a Dr while running a 'healing center' and made her patients ill while basically stealing from them.  The lady was messssssed up!
Jennifer’s kids - “are we a joke to you?!” 😢
Couldn’t wait for today! Love you Bailey! Also I think both should have stayed in jail forever😒
i neeeeeed subs baileeeyyyy
Yeaay xD
They both should have been in there for life.
Baileys THANK YEWWWW got me
Hi 👋
I love you Bailey! I do not normally say that to anyone much less a YouTuber, but I was going to try to finish cooking during your intro and couldn't because it cracked me up. I can't lie either. I love it! 🙌
As a CO Native; The Springs has it spots 🙄 lol.  Welcome back, Happy New Year & THANK YOU for the content 💚
“Are we in clue?”
I was just asking myself if you stopped doing these permanently. Thankfully not 🙌🏾
The millennium butterfly clips are everything right now ❤️💪🏻
Welcome back gorgeous!! 🖤🖤
Hi bailey!!!!! ❤❤❤ So glad to see you back! <3
Welcome back, Girlfriend. We missed you.
i think he was just as complicit as she was
Girl please cover Lizzie Borde. She was highly guilty, but it's still technically unsolved ....
Idk if it’s because I’m Claircognizant or a military spouse (he’s a vet now) but I predicted this entire story and I was right 😂😂
I love Co Springs. Lol I hate all the bad rep it gets from the crazies 😂 promise it is a cute charming town though
Big Panda Bear Hugs from a 68 yr old Grammy from Kirby, Texas, USA 🐼
I love you so much Bailey💕
AHA !!! So it _was_ the husband ! We were right ! ☺
IM liking this just simply based on the extreme theme 🎶 songggg ❤️
Bailey!🖤🖤🖤
Sooooo glad you’re back!!!🥳🥳  You should look into the “Tall Hot Blonde” case…would looooove to hear your take on it😘
Beginning of the video comment here..I'm planning on getting married in Colorado Springs in the fall of 23-Absolutely stunning place- I will 100% invite you.  I would honestly just die..probably. 🖤
Audrey Marie Hilley…. I want to hear you get all up in that story.  She fake her own death very interesting story
11:03 I love her 🤣 her humor is just 20/10 💜
yay!
I totally lost it at "slapping Meats together"🤣🤣🤣🤣
Meat slapping haha 😄
Bailey is sooo gorgeousssss
I am so glad you are back!! I have missed you!! I hope you had a wonderful holiday and New Year!!
He has my kids I’m fighting
Our savior has returned !
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS! been a fan for awhile but decided to let you know today
The elongated theme song was very satisfying. Thank you, Bailey ❤️
I'm born and raised in colorado springs and still live here. Great but tragic story
Psychos and religion…..
When I heard the gun was named Peacemaker I thought of Wynonna Earp.
We’ve missed you sooooo much!! Nearly cried when I seen the “I’m back” notification! 🤍🤍🤍
You are so hilarious and wonderful to watch.  Never a dull moment.  I love your telling of all the mysteries.  Don't ever change 😀
My grandma was friends with Diane in high school. She was shocked when she heard this case.
Ah, as an antique gun collector, this is right up my alley (I too own an 1878 Colt revolver but not the same model).
🦇💜🦇💜🦇💜🦇
Congrats on 6 million Bailey!!! ❤️❤️❤️
If his wife was sick it’s not far-fetched at all that he would take out an insurance policy on her. I’m not putting guilt past him but I do think they didn’t have enough evidence to convict him from what I heard
you should talk about Billy Milligan next video i think the whole story would interest you
These two idiots are adults, they new what they were doing!
i have lupus and i felt so excited when she brought up lupus because nobody talks about it
Bailey: it wasn't the husband don't get ahead of yourself Me: 🙋🏾🤔🙋🏾🤔🙋🏾🤔Bailey umm Bailey here please ahh then why is he going to jail ??🤔🤣🤣🤣
Hello Bailey, nice to see you back, Happy New Year's 2022😁😁
Missed u Bailey! Hope u had a GREAT break!
"are we in Clue?"  hahahahahaha
I've been to Colorado Springs many times as far as I know its a beautiful town. We always went as a kid on the way to the Rockies. But you never really know a place until you live there.
The fact he was smiling in his mugshot like that
I got the sweatpants and long sleeve shirt I’m in LOVE ❣️ love you so so much
bailey, I would love you to do a video on the case of Eliza Samudio, that's a very famous case here in Brazil and we are all angry about the outcome here
11:05  i literally love her!!!! the laugh tho <3
I think their sentences should have been switched. I think she was manipulated, but still did the thing. Prison time would be appropriate, but not life. Him on the other hand....he may not have pulled the trigger but she wouldn't be dead if he didn't make it happen.
Today is my BIRTHDAY AND SHE IS BACKKK!!! Love you♥️♥️🥳💕💕💕
Very lackluster Bailey. So you go away for what? A month and come back with this case? There are so many other shocking cases subscribers keep recommending but you won’t pay attention. I mean, it’s still sad but this case for a comeback? Maybe I’m just disappointed you are more invested in that history podcast which by the way I don’t care for. Also, as a fan of over 2 years, it seems to me you’re not being your genuine self all the time. Lots of gimmicks, not funny or cute. Stay on your toes girl. There are many other girls who are doing the exact same thing you “initiated” and excelling at it. Don’t leave us unattended and give us the goods! The real you, for a change. Just my opinion.
I hope Brian sees this.
Any time these stories start with, “he became a Christian…it’s not gonna go well.
Just moved out of The Springs in November after living there for 7 1/2 years. This is the first time I’ve heard this story!
Finally! Been checking posts since  the 1st weak of January 😂 thaaaanks! Love your make up today. ❤️
Im about halfway into the video and im going to say it was the mistress lol
I’m watching this wearing my new merch that I got for Christmas! My life is complete!
I’d been trying to get my girlfriend to watch Bailey for a year now. She was always like “I DoNt LiKe MaKeUp”. Well more and more videos I was listening to; and she was forced to listen to and mow she’s watched all of them. Lol. Glad you’re back!
I squeeled in a very 40 year old way in front of 2 dogs and a cat now thinking I've lost my F-ing mind when I saw your new video! Slamming it on your history stories sister!
I MISSED U I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW U POSTED
You should check out Larry Gene Bell and Timothy Ray Jones Jr. Both from South Carolina and both horrible people!
🥰🥰🥰
why do the butterfly clips look like the spikes of the coronavirus 😩
Breakfast with Bailey
Sounds like a definite power dynamic at play where Brian wanted to have his cake and eat it, too. He definitely should not have gotten off as lightly as he did.
My bf is leaving and your videos make me feel better thanks hes a piece of dogshit
Oh & she had 2 children. Were they Ben's children? I just hope someone took care of them. What people will do, never ceases to amaze me! Idiots.
Is it just me but did anyone else see the smile on Brian’s mugshot?
I get so scared that released prisoners watching you talk about them are gonna come for you 😭 please nooo it scares me :(
I have been waiting for this video!! Welcome back Bailey!!! 😌😍
“SLAPPING MEATS!”😂 🥩💥🍖
I heard Peacemaker.. Wynonna Earp (,:
My three year old daughter loves your theme song and sings it with you every time 🥰
binging all of your videos these past couple weeks
literally the first thing i thought when i clicked on this video was “aw her hair looks so pretty”
Can you do a story on jack chapman
Welcome back beautiful 😍 😘 ❤
I love that you're using Trixie blush!! I literally just watched her latest video right before yours!
Story suggestion: Susan Smith
Love the butterfly clips 👏👏👏♥️
I would love for you and Brittney Vaughn to collaborate together.  That would be the best true crime and makeup story ever!!!!
I am living for the feral cat energy! 😍😍😍 love you so!!! 🖤
You are ridiculous I love you
The queen is BACK👑❤️
Bailey is extra spicy today 🤣🤣
How dare you lie to us! 😜
Do the Mr. Cruel case next please :D :D
Hello 🥳
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey! Slapping meats!!! I can't breathe!🤣🤣
Why are they all smiling like freaks in their mugshots
I am having a great evening 😏😎
I think they call it the Peacemaker because it puts an end to any drama that might be going on...
what in the chad daybell
His recent mugshot is creepy af.
I love how the first part of the episode she was like "It was NOT the husband!" then about 15 minutes later she's like, "Okay, yeah, it was the husband, but he didn't pull the trigger." She really had me going for a sec. Love you, Bailey! I have a suggestion, Robert Durst died today, and I don't believe you have done a video on him yet.
It’s been a rough month for me mentally as soon as I saw you post I just cried thank you for I missed you 😭😭
i totally thought you left and came back already! lol i miss you alraeady!
@29:06 our girl Jennifer looking like a young Martha Stewart up in here
All hale the return of the queen 👑.  She's back everyone, she's finally back😭😭😍!!!
Love like a sister Bailey! I hope you have an amazing 2022! And I think that Brian should be still in jail, he totally used that woman...
SLAPPIN' MEATS!!!!! 🍖 🥓 🥩  I cannot!!!! 🤣🤣🤣☠☠☠ Love you Bailey!!!
OK, did I miss something or is Brian just young Kevin Bacon?
I WAS GOING THROUGH WITHDRAWALS BAILEY
Bailey I always love your hair , I need hair tutorials pls 😩😍
I'm so glad you're back❤️❤️❤️❤️
My boyfriend loves you, he knows your theme song and says you help his anxiety so ig he’s our bf now
You don't know how relieved I am Bailey is back 🥳 especially after the rough holidays...
I love your wit and sarcasm even though I don't wear makeup. I hope you would consider Andrea Yates,Susan Smith and Oj  Simpson cases for future podcasts. 🥰🥰🥰
Bailey….. 🥸 did you did not just say “slappin meats together” Bahahaha   Also…  PLEASE TEACH US IN A SHORT VIDEO HOW YOU DID THIS HAIR STYLE!!   It’s so early 2000’s! Love it. I just can’t tell how you got all that volume?
Please do Henry Lee Lucas 🙏🏽😩
Bailey, you literally make me look forward to Mondays. A miracle!
Happy birthday to the 1% reading this
The Peacemaker.. so your victim can make peace with their maker.
Please look in to Robert Durst
Life Insurance says it all
Still lovin' the theme song. Love the way she did it this time! Bailey does a great job of making it slightly different each time
All the Jennifer's coming out of the wood work in the comments section 😂
Congrats Bailey 6 million subs
They both should’ve been slapped with life sentences. How would Jennifer know of Diane’s work addy if it wasn’t for Brian?! Also the insurance policy… smmfh Police had waaayy too much evidence just to go off of Diane’s brother testimony or Jennifer’s family member testimony.
"slapping meats"
CONGRATS ON 6 MILLION!!!
Your so pretty!!
the "peacemaker" like in the show Wynona Earp? 🤯
ur makeup is gorgeous
Bailey!!🤗😍🤗 You're the best female storyteller!! Mr. Ballen is the best male storyteller!! P.s.- i have a really close friend that could be your twin! No exaggeration.
has anyone else heard about this case from the Detective Joe Kenda show??
WOAHHH IM HERE EARLYYYY THIS IS SO FUNNN
dang she one day after my birthday - 30:50
It was the “ go to Walmart and pick one up real quick!” 😂 😆
Those mugshots man… why they so happy?!
It takes 2 to tango, he should've stayed in prison. 😒
Lots of we knows lol
happy 2022 bailey! loved your unauthorized dramatic reenactment on Dexter New Blood as Molly Park 👯‍♀️
I really do like the *theme song* 😁
Also, pancreatic cancer is considered one of theost painful types of cancers to die from. So, she got what she deserved in the end I guess.
you have no idea how much i needed this today. thank you queen
"takes pace in co springs, super charming, cute, little town" 😂 Its not to little and definitely not cute but you should come to Co Springs! I would totally drive to see you! 🥰❤️
Just love you and thanks for putting the stories together each week
Omygoooshhh u back oh thank u thank u this was horrible u make utube literally don’t leave us again 🤣🥰🤩
Theres a missing girl in my town for the past 2 years named kaylene oehling. She went missing in etna, pa. She was last seen with her boyfriend. Her family is trying to find her but they arent getting much help. If you could put awareness out for her. I dont know her personally but I do know her parents need help and I feel for the whole family. She might still be alive. Please help bring awareness.
Bailey: I mean how many people in Colorado Springs have an antique gun collection?   Most people in Colorado Springs
BAILEY Hey love!! Have you done the story on Haleigh Cummings yet?? If not Please do it! PRETTY PLEASE!! POOR LITTLE GIRL WAS JUST FORGOTTEN ABOUT!!
Wait Wyatt Earps peace maker??
Thank you Bailey hop you had a nice holidat too.
Hi!
Can you please do a video on Victoria Marten, the story. I know it’s super gruesome. But consider it, please
Literally just get a divorce lol
Bailey girl, you need a gunsmith and bladesmith at your disposal.  ❤️
Missed you!
Bailey, I think you should look into the case of Shanda Sharer. Even if you don't do a MMM on her story, I still think you will find it really interesting.
WELCOME BACK!!! Happy 2022!!
I love that Bailey gives the vibe of being a small channel...🥰
So like… WHY was Jennifer smiling in her mugshot?!
YES THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR! 😭🤪🥰
You are so freaking goofy! “Cocked”😜
The Peacemaker is a Colt Single Action Army (gun). It was known as the Peacemaker due to Benjamin Kittredge marketing of the gun as this in 1874 as he was a major distributor for Colt.
I have lupus and RA and it stinks
EEEEEK it's Monday 🥰
Can you please do The Pizza bomber case it’s such a sad and interesting case!🕵️
Why is your pinky nail not painted? It’s driving me crazy wondering😅
SHE'S BACK! START THE MUSIC AND GET OUT THE THRONE BECAUSE SHE'S ARRIVED!
Although the subjects are heavy, i love your videos! You are funny and charismatic. Thank you!!!
That theme song makes my whole week better!!! Can't wait to dig into this one!!! ❤️🥰
Does Anyone else feel like Bailey is there BESTIE!! BUT like maybe no one told her yet!?!?  ummm. no?? Just me? 🤔🤷‍♀️
It’s great to have you back. ❤️
Happy New Year!!!
That's one year before I was born.
Yeah Bailey is back.
ughhhhh i HATE when i have to recock. so annoying
This story was a rollercoaster
"OH Nay Nayy" my fav
🤣🤣 "slapping meats together"🤣🤣
Bailey is so effin cute!!!
Watching this at work and laughed so loud when you said slapping meats everyone’s staring at me
Dr. Quinn would have been all over this 😂
Only three hours and 2000 comments already! Awesome🤘
please do the story of harry powers the blue beard of quiet dell
Giiiirl, why is it that every time we get to the Theme song I feel like I MUST share my appreciation by liking the video 😂🤦🏼‍♀️❤️❤️ So much love
We need a hair tutorial!! Tell us how u get ur hair like that and the extensions u use!!!
I think if Brian was involved then Jen was a victim too but we can't say for certain that's the case. . . It's tricky
Kind of mad you lied to me, Bailey! Wait,  I'm not mad I'm just disappointed hahaha  jk!  I was so stinking excited when I got the video notification today I almost watched it at work, knowing it would be interrupted a hundred times,  but I waited until I washed my dishes tonight,  look at my self control! 😆 made my Monday 100% better!
I just died at Bailey calling a population of 250,000 a small town😂☠️ girl what
i just know Lt. Joe Kenda worked this case
I hope you a great Christmas and happy New Year. Love my Mondays!!!
Do Barney Ward next please!
"Let's hope 2022 treats us better"  *My school had 4 covid cases* *Some place burned (I think) and some kids died* (i think this happened in new york?)
Ugh dudes be doing THE MOST.
Yes girl I’ll be glad to protect my new iPhone 13pro max thank you
I LOVE your look!!!! It is FIERCE!!!
I miss youuuuuu 🥺
I think Brian deserves life in prison.  He manipulated Jennifer just like a cult leader influences his followers.  I feel so sad for all the children involved.
Hii Friend! Happy new year 😌💞 so excited to watch this👏🏽 love you🖤🖤🖤🖤
I OWN A HOUSE IN COLORADO SPRINGS BY THE AIRPORT YOU CAN STAY WITH ME ILYYYY
Brian’s mugshot gives me the creeps tbh
Bailey " I hope 2022 is treating g you right"  Me" I made it 6 days in to 2022 before I am now waiting to see if I have cancer in my jaw 🙃:
I love it when she recreates talking on the phone with a makeup sponge or brush 😂😂
His pictures from prison are far too gleeful 🤨
The Queeen is back! 👑
I can’t wait until you blow up bigger than faulty beauty influences. The day you make your own product is the day I’ll buy more makeup 💄I’ll go bankrupt for you Bailey !
Can I come in your show - please??  You can do my make up and I can tell you a true crime story?
Isn't that the same type of gun Alec Baldwin shot?
In a Christmas story Ralphie says “Was there no end to this conspiracy of irrational prejudice against Red Ryder and his Peacemaker?!”
All Hail Queen Bailey!!!!
Gary Gilmore please!!!
Happy New Year! Yay it’s Bailey!🤘🏻❤️
I’d love for you to look at “The Serpent “  Charles Sobhraj  from the 1970’s … it’s wild just how slippery he was
I don’t care if she was manipulated, she killed an innocent woman! Bryan, yeah he is a manipulator!
I think both. I think he encouraged it but she guilty
That "yuck" was 👌
Great episode 🙌
I'm 32 and a momma, and i laughed an abnormal amount at all the gun "cocking 😂😂😂😂😂
It's called a peace maker because once you pull the trigger at your enemy, they become a lot more "peaceful"...assuming you hit your target.
if you don't sing the theme song with bailey you're lying.
Bailey…do you only have one nail not painted? Lol 😂 what’s going on here 🧐🥰🤣
Best channel!!
Could you please do the West memphis 3?!!
Ngl I fkn love those long barrel single action guns
At 24/25 minutes, “Then why don’t you do it then you lil b****” made me spit out my la croix while I was taking a sip 😳😵🤣🤣🤣🤣
ASU in my greenlandic language means "oh knock it out" or "oh come on" or "stop it" hehe
Yay, what a pleasant surprise ☺ 😊 😍
FINALLY. Where have you been?!? 😭 jk I know the answer to that but still!!
When Bailey keeps doing stories around where I live … BAILEY 💀
I need that foundation brushie thingie! Does anyone know where it's from? I couldn't find any info on that :(
I'm so glad you're back!!! I got to binge-watch the stuff from December to get through the break ;-) we just bought our own home! And its super secluded, so no internet for a while....lol. I've missed your stories!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
22:08 SLAPPING MEATS????
Love you bailey 🦋🖤🦋🦇
How many of us have COVID or a variant?✋✋✋✋✋ Thank you for keeping me going thru this pain in the 🍑 sickness 💜💋💋💋💋
I’m pretty sure this was an episode on Homicide Hunter…. But I’m only like 7 minutes into this video so may be jumping the gun a little
👋✅
So so soooo happy your back ❤️ hope you had a gorgeous Christmas and new year ❤️
❤
So excited your back I was looking forward to watching 😍 hope you had a nice relaxing holidays
Why is your merch so expensive? 😩 I can’t afford $30 t-shirts. Some of us struggle!
Was just in Colorado Springs last weekend. 😳My son got to play hockey at the rink on the Air Force Base.
slapping meat.. LOL Bailey I love you.. stop disappearing on us..  you're the best!!
In love with this video’s hair and makeup 😍😍
This was likely recorded before Betty White died. Things are NOT WELL Bailey!!
I need this hair
My babe said that you didn't need that much makeup....I told him to just watch. LOVE the makeup, LOVE your ability to tell a tale! AND LOVE YOU!!!
I believe they both deserved to be in jail. However , she was let out early clearly because they knew she was dying so I could understand them making some space in prison for other criminals that were gonna be a greater threat so I’m not too mad about it.
YESSSSS! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOUUUU BAILEYYYY. HAPPY NEW YEARRRR
So glad to see you back! Hope you had a wonderful break and holidays 🌟🎄 Great story today 👏 2022 is not getting off to a great start lol glad your here 💕
Would love for you to show how you did your hair!!
Can you do the Amityville horror house? (William DeFeo Jr.)
just regained my sanity after wisdom tooth surgery and IM SO HAPPY YAY
Bailey: Well, no, yes, nay nay, but no.. But yes Me: I understand completely
Slapping meats 😂
I share all your videos before watching them lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂 JENNIFER is dying here ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
CONGRATULATIONS ON 6 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS ❤️
So glad you are back ❤️ Missed your voice and face while you have been gone!!! Happy 2022!!!
Perfect timing , first day of the semester was today and I’m already behind some how😂😅
"Shana shaa shana shaa, shana shasha shana.. SHAAAAAA.. aa." Loved this version 😂
Thank you for representing my state Bailey love you
SHE'S BACK ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please do a segment on Susan Smith.
*Science*
I’d bet Joe Kenda would be like “ Nay nay, Bailey. Colorado Springs is not a cute place.”  But anyway, I love this look! It’s my favorite as of right now. And that hair makes it all the better. Great job on the look and the story. 👍
CONGRATS ON 6 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS BAILEY!!!
Best birthday gift ever 😍😍😍
I think that they should have had similar sentencing! Who believes what someones MIL has to say about them?!
Happy New Year! I got Covid last week but at least our Buffalo Bills won!!
Hey Bailey im from south africa and id love your take on Oscar Pistorius
Congrats on 6Mil B...well deserved 🥳♥️
The twit set herself up with a vintage firearm!!🤣🤣🤣 Dumba$$!!!🤣🤣🤣
This is why murderes should never get out of prison. They are violent criminals.  All pedophiles need to be locked in menatal hospitals and rapists also. I don't understand why these people get to walk free.
Please cover either BTK or the Holly Bobo case!
Missed you !
Yey! You're back!
Colorado Springs is not nice. There’s so many people here and it’s super ghetto. 0/10 would not recommend. This is why I’m moving
It’s the INTRO for me🤟🏼🙌🏽🤣
Will you please do a camp face paint....yup.
Just destroyed all their children’s  lives for nothing!!!
FINALLY 🤗🤗🤗💫💫💫
So everyone got out?💀💀
They are both guilty!!!
“look you little… kitty cats”
We missed you old friend 🤣😂
If you don't sing along with the theme song, you're not a real fan
I have nothing to eat for dinner
Thank you for your time. Love listening to these. Brian should have stayed in jail.
Have you heard The Thrill Teen Alyssa bustamante really interesting (respectfully) the way they got her to confess it’s was like criminal minds and because her advocate (she was 15) was trying to convince her to confess the confession was thrown out of court by the judge
LITERALLY THE ONLY REASON I GOT OUT OF BED TODAY IS BY GETTING THE NOTIFICATION THAT YOURE BACK❤️❤️❤️
Do the Elizabeth Smart case plz
You should do a video on David Camm
Sooooo glad your back! Missed you!
Congratulations on the 6m Bailey!!! 👏🎉
H h holmes pleasr
I would love a video on Andrea Yates. Terrible story and I think justice was not served.
Girl we know you are a busy lady and if you want to film stuff ahead of time so you can not fall behind then do that!! We (I) definitely dont want you to get burnt out and I want you to have breaks for yourself!!  I love you Bailey!! Dont want you going anywhere!!
ik you won’t see this but hi bae i love you sm
I just love you sweetie and im so proud of all these amazing accomplishments that you have are the last few years im sure your mom is over the moon proud of you .keep doing an amazing job chasing your dreams. 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Not SLAPPIN MEATS 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rest In Peace Diane, what a tragedy
Hey. I don’t know if you know about the Hello Kitty case! If not, check it out because you will be shocked!!!
I’d love to see you do the story of James Klindt! He’s from my hometown and cut up his wife with a chainsaw and dumped her in the Mississippi River. Crazy story!
Monday x1 a month
Amazing what make up can do....
As someone whose name is Jennifer, Bailey constantly going "Jennifer!" has me instantly going "im sorry!"
I love your hair! And your makeup as well!! Always looking forward to Monday 💀
SLAPPIN MEATS TOGETHER! AHHHHHHHH 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  BAILEYYY! I 👏🏼 AM 👏🏼 DEAD!
love it ❤️
all day i was waiting for this b to upload so i could drive to all of my unnecessary errands with my comfort video/person playing 😂
Happy new year bailey..... I missed you so much
When I do the theme song my mom be like : *you watching Bailey again?* 😂😂
Love you Bailey!!
I miissseeddd yooouuu
Would be interesting to know if Brian got life insurance only for his wife, or if he got a policy for both of them? Knowing that would make a difference in my opinion as to his involvement. This was an odd video in that my name is Jennifer. All those times you are saying "Jennifer" with that shame on you tone, lol. And just for more coincidence sake...... My husband name is Brian, and his gf just before we met was Diane. Weird cosmic thing? Naw, just that we are all around the same age, and those were popular names back then.   And when will girls learn, any time a guy says "If you love me you will __________" it's time to walk away before giving in.
Day 267 of asking for Rodney Alcala
I needed this , peace love and happiness to you all . May the new year be the best for all of you 🌞✨
love how you describe colorado springs🥺
you still need to do the case of Paulette the girl who went missing in Mexico for days and they found her tucked in the corned of the bed!
Yay!!! Welcome back. We love ya.
I remember this story! I lived in Colorado Springs most of my life. Crazy story.
Nay nay!!! Love it.
Been here since the beginning! I can't believe you are at 6million followers already! Love you!
Bailey was my best discovery of 2021 other than my new found love for Wagamama’s bang bang cauliflower😂💗
Lol not my name bring Jennifer 😂
You are back !!! So excited to watch when I’m through cooking dinner . I’ve been down with Covid for a second time and have been binge watching your videos again . You can’t image how you have kept me entertained which helps one feel better and rake their minds of things  !
I think switching brians case to 2nd and conspiracy is more justified because he clearly knew with the life insurance and the exposure to friends, how ever I thin he didnt do anything execept but the idea in and let Jen jen do the work idk tho
It's called the peacemaker because you could fire it multiple times instead of only one time before reloading like all guns were prior to the peacemaker was created.
I'm so glad you had time to rest and enjoy yourself
Bailey: If you’re new here Me: Welcome to your new obsession Bailey: Hi!
Congrats on 6 million subscribers 👍
I was on and off your youtbe this morning 🤣🤣
diane deserved better
BAILEY I ALMOST SPIT MY WATER OUT WHEN YOU SAID SLAPPIN MEATS TOGETHER
After you just got done slapping meats and stuff 😂😂😂
Your hair is so cute! You should do a tutorial!
The lack of gun knowledge is expected from Californians and I guess the formed opinions are too as anyone can have opinions. The only thing is that opinions can create misinformation. Single action vs double action vs semi automatic and so many more. No hate or any negativity to Bailey because I’ve loved videos and watch her other series. Just thought I could share my opinion too🤷‍♀️
Did anyone else notice the engagement ring????
I missed you !!!! So glad you’re back!!
Yes we know you are a bit of a liar and unrealizable But lots of true crime channels so you are never missed
The Peacemaker was one of the most popular arms for the time because it was reliable. The single action (need to pull the hammer to set the trigger and rotate the cylinder) required fewer parts and was easier to manufacture compared to a double action (single trigger pull rotates the cylinder and sets/ fires a round). Actually more accurate as less force is needed to pull the trigger, and with training can be fired as fast as a double action.
Thank goodness!  I think they were trying to frame the exact husband, (she was assumed to be a male during the attack &  quickly gave the gun back to him- possession is 9/10ths of the law) but he had a solid alibi!
Diane Downs!!!
This sounds like Daybell drama 1.0….
I love your show.  You are one of my close friends and you don’t even know it—not in a creepy way!  But thank you for all you do. 🙏
Congrats on hitting 6Million Subs 🥳
They both most definitely did this, and he definitely should’ve got life
💐 💐 💐
SLAPPING MEATS Bailey stop
“After they just got done slappin meats together” 😭😭
the life insurance thing is VERY convicting. Getting life insurance with a pre existing condition, especially lupus which can destroy your organs, is SOOO difficult. Brian would've had to know exactly what to write on the forms in order to get the policy
Absolutely threw me off with the intro today 😅😤
They're gonna have life together alright...just not what they planned and together in a sense, just not in the same house. So I stand corrected...but, it's not fair he got much less than she did. I feel they were both in on it, not just her.
Finally you back, girl!!
So happy you’re back:)))
Congrats on 6 million subscribers Bailey, well deserved 💖
"Bryan, come on in!... just kidding. I don't know where he's at."😅🤣🤣🤣
Me: *considers making a bad choice* Also me: But what would Bailey say???
Missed you so much and your videos! Glad you’re back
Love a Colorado episode <3
I walked past this crime scene on my way to elementary school when I was little C.S.C native 🙃
Why are they smiling in their mugshots??
You are so funny girl love these thankssss
Yes they both should got Equal sentencing , sad she got carma
I think they conspired together equally and promised to back up each other.  Then, I think, he threw her under the bus, and she did the same to him and tried to get a lighter sentence by saying he manipulated her.
Bailey u are such a beautiful woman😍...you have had such influence in my love for makeup and true crime
Colorado Springs sounds like the sorta place MLMs would *adore* 🤦🏼‍♀️🤣
The commuted prison sentence was in purpose. They didn’t want to pay for her cancer treatment
Missed this bailey ❤️
Yipee! Bailey is back! Happy New Year 🎉🎈
was that a pterodactyl in the beginning of this video ?    =)
Shout out to those butterfly clips girrrrllll!!!!
I just knew she was a make up artist for  celebrities…
Brian insurance claim rises a few red flags ask me it's clear what was going on she was manipulated period .tried to escape is another red flag 🚩 🚩
Who is here for the theme song?  Just me? Cool...
Yaaay Bailey is baaacckk!!!!! Made. My. Week !
I wanna see a collab with bailey and that chapter. I feel like their bantering together would be amazing
Yesss you’re back! I thought I still had to wait a week or two for Bailey to be back and then when the notification pops up, it’s the best surprise! It’s a great beginning to my birthday week 😁
I had the worst day at work, coming home and changing into my PJs and seeing a new Bailey video has made this day not so bad after all. Love you Bailey ❤️ 🥰 thank you for being you
My first thought "The husband hired someone", then you said he was having an affair.   Another great video, babes! 🖤
The Claire’s butterfly clips are EVERYTHING! ❤️
Already starting out 22 with the Rona 😭
I literally adore you 😭😘❤️ and your tattoos are literally everything.  Your left pinky finger missing nail polish is distracting me 💅🏻😂🖤
"After slappin' meats together" Omfg Bailey😂
Bailey I got so excited I did a happy dance
people who cheat -- and on their SICK SPOUSES -- are literally the worst
I'm so confused thought your having January off 🤦🏼‍♀️ I mean I'm not complaining just very confused 🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
So glad to see you back! I hope you had a nice break! (:
For the past couple weeks, every Monday I've felt that I've been missing something. I've been missing Bailey and her spirit ❤
YASSSSSSSS She's backkkkkkk
Soo this is what shanika from eating pretty gets “the piece maker ” from 🤣🤣🤣
Watching this as I get ready for a date with my boyfriend . Today is my two year anniversary of being clean from SH . I am so happy you posted today . It feels like a present tbh !! Love u
congrats on 6 million bailey! ❤️ been here since 10k ❤️
Wearing those butterfly clips like a crown 👑 💜
Brian should be in prison still!  his last mug shot..... His whole face says "I'm crazy & I am guilty"
I think they both should have done life in Prison. They orchestrated this together. Even though she pulled the trigger, Brian was just as guilty. You are right, no woman should ever do anything like that to be with a guy. He told her all this BS and I bet she believed it. Plus add in the insurance policy. Yep he deserved life in prison with no possibility of parole in my opinion.
You make me happy Bailey, everytime im down i put your videos on!
Brian sounds like a Christian cult leader 👀
Bailey please talk about the Jessica Chambers case!!!
Best Birthday Present Ever!!!
I don’t know man. I feel the opposite. I think she manipulated him.
I love Bailey, her enegery and her videos alot.:X, but this one felt abit too boring and "meh" compared to her other videos
Have you done a story on Savanna Greywind?
Hey bailey❤️am a huge fan from morocco 🇲🇦
Yay! You’re back!
I liked as soon as you said Hi. Happy new year 🥰
I live in Colorado Springs. It’s pretty big now
Always God's fault.  Bailey can you tell him I've had enough cancer too
in jailll!!!
Not gunna lie, I have this video a like purely for this version of the theme song. 😂😂 fckin love it!! 😂😂
I went to the same university they met at!😳
Yay you’re back!
Please add John Bunting to your list! 🥺🥺
Ick. That smiling mugshot of Brian is so creepy. And he's out free now.
Love Bailey 💜  Thanks again for another fantastic 👏 video x
Is Jennifer smiling in her mug shot?? And.....Why? 🤔
this is such a sad story.....need a subject for a future episode? Mel Ignatow......Mel was a special kind of f***ked up.........Congrats on 6M!....Welcome Back....much love from Newfoundland, Canada
pull the hammer back
Please do a show on the Kansas City butcher
Glad your back... You made my day Bailey Sha na Sha Sha na Sha Sha na Sha.......... Sha na.... SHAAAAAAA! Wonder if Joe Kenda helped solve this.. but poor Diana she didn't deserve that
look up Brittany Wood from Mobile AL.. there's a doc on peacock called "monster in the shadow"
It was really nice not to have to watch a ton of ads during this story 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
If you haven’t, I couldn’t find it… will you do a video on Joel Guy Jr? It’s INSANE!
The way that I was lit rally just thinking about Bailey
I have Lupus and it’s a struggle. I feel bad for the victim Diane. We want to live and live well.  I’m glad people are talking about it more and more.
😂😂”What a fu*king winner.”☠️😂✌️
she has some nice hair but i just think of the shampoo bill every time
I'm so glad you're back 😍
AH! I'm so excited, I binged all your videos over the winter break because I had to stop during the semester but I'm so happy to be watching this again!
colorado has a lot of stories coming out of it…
“YES JEN AND BEN”😂
😄 I’ve missed you!
This one was kind of boring
I have lupus. It is horrible and its something that many dont understand.
Not sure if you've already covered this case of susan Powell and Josh Powell? But that's such a horrendous crime 😭
Ben probably thought jen was gone use it on him 🤣
My name being Jennifer and every time you say it I get scared like I did something 😭
Missed you very much
I think we would all riot if you ever stopped doing your theme song 😭 I can’t help but sing along and it lives rent free in my head
Happy Birthday to me 🥳 Bailey's back, what a prefect gift 🎁 🤗
This is my favorite video in a while I laughed so much because of ur commentary 😂❤️
I love that her returning video fell on my birthday. Best birthday gift ever !!! ☺️💕
We ALL HAVE FREE AGENCY TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT OR WRONG!
Your hair is gorgeous
Eye freaking roll
They did that together. He didn’t manipulate her. They were both down for it.
Oh yes happy Monday and happy New Year in 2022
Yay Baileys back!!!
I freaking love when you do Colorado cases
Hi Bailey missed you and thanks for being back  love you ❤️
the part with the gun 😭 “ babe babe i wanna gun… thx babe “ you’re too funny bailey
Equally to Blame! Definitely. (well, just what I think)
Well jen fired with the peace maker wich took a long time to load and reload ...like u said It would have given her the time she needed to make peace with the person and she shot her 4 times....so she thought well 4 times.....
NEW VIDEO IDEA: I was wondering if you could make a video about the disappearance of diamond and tionda bradley. They were two little girls aged 4 and 6 from Chicago who disappeared in 2001 and their case has never been solved!!! The case has a lot of theories and twists and turns. I think no one knows about this case because the girls are African American but if they were white it would be known around the country unfortunately… this case resonates with me because I’m from chicago and remember when this happened
Sis really smiled in her mug shots
Yessss queen you were so missed!!! I’ll take the lie!!!! I love it!!!! Definitely needed some therapy from you!!!!!!!
Awhile 19000 describers already
Oh wow you already got 19,000 already all this is John Madden from Pawtucket Rhode Island
Bailey, 2022 is your year! I can’t wait to see all the content you will be blessing us with 😫✨I am strangely always seem to be cooking when I watch 😂 your my new cooking buddy!
Shoutout ASU!
“Which would be a little weird to say after you just got done slapping meats together but okay Brian.” 💀💀
Finallyyyy 😭😭❤️
Bailey the two songs been sent please listen to them I m sure Chris will know you would of llisten... his happy and want to share it.... I hope Chris chosen you two cool tracks you  like you give me feedback
What an awesome birthday present! Thanks Bailey!
Anyone who smiles like that in their mug shot is instantly guilty in my mind….. gross
I love when you do the voices of the individuals that you’re talking about. It cracks me up!!!  Brian & his group of prison friends: “yeah, man! We’re gonna bust outta here! 💪🏼” 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
This made being stuck in bed with the LMNOP covid variant a little more bearable!
It’s the butterfly clips for me!
Foking missed you
I always sing the into with you🤗
NOOOOOO FORT CARSON IS A RED FLAG
babe i needed this today thank you so much
22:58 gold 😂
You look beautiful as always love the hair and makeup  They both deserve to be in prison she is grown and knows right from wrong 😡
The butterfly clips are serving 7th grade realness and i am here👏🏽for👏🏽 it👏🏽!!
Yessssss the Queen is back 🔥🔥🔥❤❤🔥
Can baily wish me a happy b-day I've been loving your videos since I was 14 and now I'm 18  😫💕💕
I'm so excited that you're back!! I love the video and I'm excited to see what you have in store for us☺️
* me living right by springs knowing how ghetto it is * i also live it pueblo lolll i hate colorado sometimes
Welcome back queen💖
Bailey you should do an episode of the Susan Nason case; it’s wild.
Wow I have lupus people never know what it truly is thanks for adding that little educational bit on lupus ! U don’t even know it but u just raised awareness thank u 💜💜
Not widely heard of, but could you consider doing an episode on the double homicide of Linda and Danielle Moreno in kennewick, WA 2004?
Marcus Wesson pls
just got out of the hospital great thing to come home too <3
Double whammy! Euphoria Season 2 Episode came out last night and I wake up to Bailey Sarian coming back (however temporary it is)! Too happy!
I notice your super amazingly beautiful backgrounds🥺👉🏻👈🏻❤️‍🔥
“Why don’t you do it yourself then, you little BIT..!” 😭🤣😭🤣 On a serious not though, I pray for Diane, and her children🙏🏽
I would LOOOOOVE to see your take on the Liz Golyar/Kari Farber case. It's got so many twists
I love this Outro music!!
The peacemaker makes someone make peace with their maker.
A++ on your lupus explanation, Babe.
Looking especially gorgeous Bailey. Wishing everyone a Happy New Year!!!
Thank you sooo much for wearing my brand again 😭
Oh, you´re such a drama queen or better say the queen of drama. I love it how you talking to the beauty blender like it´s the phone. If I were a woman my make up would look terrible, but the way you perform all together with the story, I just love it. Tricked or not, karma is free and he should have rotten in jail too, the sad thing is, that three kids have lost both of their parents.
So excited you’re back!!!♥️
Todays live rendition of *theme song was particularly lovely 🎙
Excellent hair Bailey.  ❤️ Thank you for your excellent story telling. You're so relatable for me. - I do feel like they were both equally responsible. I'm sure they had a whole scheme hatched, they were just idiotic and couldn't pull it off without being caught up.
slapping meats together, stop it rn LOL.
I feel like the ex mother in law is not a reliable witness.
colorado AINT all that bailey belive me lol
Peacemaker is just a name they gave a certain gun b/c most sheriffs carried back in the day... Also, having to pull the "hammer" back to fire the gun, is called a "double action", meaning you have to pull the hammer and then pull the trigger. Semi-auto and automatic guns now of days are mostly single action. A hammer was needed to hit the flint to fire the gun, that's why it's on all older style guns.
Gasparella 🤭👸🤣
I’m living for that hair style 💜💓
Talk about Jinnkid
They both were guilty
Bailey helping me out of my depression again
SLAPPING MEATS!!!!!!! LOLOLOLOL I almost choked on my swig o' water. I hope you had a wonderful holiday, Bailey Sarian.  I missed you so. <3
God's justice will be worse then any life sentence.
Pancreatic cancer IS a death sentence. No one survives that one. Wild they both got out. I wonder if he had to pay Diane family restitution?
Happy new year, Bailey Sarian.
Welcome Home, Bozo! 🥰Congrats on 6 MILLION!!! 🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉❤️
Welcome back love 💕
Hair look great btw
My name is Jennifer and Everytime Bailey says JENNIFER it makes me feel like I'm in trouble hahahaha 😂
I rushed home today from teaching school just so I could get my dose of Bailey.  Hope you had a wonderful break!
Yay you’re back!!!!!! I’ve missed you and kept checking to see if you were back and maybe I just missed the notifications. Hope your holidays were great ❤️❤️
Carl DeBrodie in Fulton, MO. Sad story. 😔
Click*click*👌🏻…..nogginz.
I mean… the insurance policy could’ve just been because she was sick 🤷🏾‍♀️ isn’t that what life insurance is for ?
I’d like to hear you talk about Rodney Alcala, he just passed away and I think a lot of his victims are still unidentified
I wonder if detective Joe Kenda solved this one. 🤔
Gotta love Bailey I love my Mondays ☺️
Very lifetime movie indeed if they ended up on your channel
Congratulations on 6Million subscribers!!!!
I would love it if you talked about one of the warren's cases. love your content.:)
I’m gonna recreate this look because Bailey looks so stinking cute
Hiiiii
I was dignosed with lupus when I was 17. It's caused my heart to fail. I had a pacemaker put in at 26, caused overlapping illnesses. I also have multiple scoliosis which It's rare to have both.
250000 is a small town?
This one was hard for me to follow. I felt like I was being scolded the whole time 🤣
Great look. Speedway bomber please
I love the outro song, it reminds me of the resident evil movies
CONGRATS ON HITTING 6 MIL. BAILEY!! I LOVE THAT FOR YOU. IT'S WELL DESERVED. ❤🤗
Please do a video on Marilyn Monroe 💐💕🙏💕💐
seems like they were trying to frame Ben for it
I don't know why I was so confused to see that you posted
Girl love you but don’t do that motion while signing the theme song hahahahahaha
Slapping meats 😂😂
Just a casual night out, cracking open cold cases with the boys.
I go to angelo state university!! go rams
Legit said “wonder if Bailey is back today “ , looked and it brought me the GREATEST joy
Hey Bailey, I love watching yr videos!Do u ever use products that come from places like Walmart, Walgreens, ect?U know,cheap kinda??
Ahhh missed you Bailey!!!!
“slapping meats together” PLSSS
The justice system failed Diane. They both should have spent the rest of their lives in prison or AT LEAST 40 years!!! Ugh! I wish they did this in Texas or Alabama. Also I wonder if Diane knew about the affair or at least suspected it. Jennifer was not manipulated IMO. She’s a liar and she stood over that poor woman and finished her off
welcome back yaaayyyyyy!!!
I love your hair it just like my 27 y o daughter
Haaay!!! I’m happy to see you, it’s been a bit, so yay!
Me immediately, It was the husband. Bailey- It wasn't the husband but he was cheating on his wife. Me- IT WAS THE HUSBAND Bailey- but it wasn't the husband don't get it twisted. Blah blah flower shop worker Jennifer Ravioli (or whatever) Me- IT WAS JENNIFER RAVILOI
I almost had a panic attack when I didn’t find the upload 😂 I’ve missed you babe
Happy you are back love watching your videos
The first time she said "Jennifer" I literally said "I had NOTHING to do with this!" Lol my name is Jennifer. 😆
Thank you for bringing light to Lupus. A lot of people are unfamiliar and don’t understand.  I was diagnosed in 2015 and it’s been an uphill battle ever since.  Diane definitely deserved better.  Thank you for another Monday! Love you!
Your my Monday start
2022 has OFFICIALLY begun! 🥳🥂🎉 Welcome back, Bails!
I hope you get all the rest and breaks you need without feeling the pressures of other people! Glad you got a break Bailey!!!
Okay...I don't think that people understand the concept of living in a small town...EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE IN A SMALL TOWN!!!! And don't get me started about if you're doing something you know that you shouldn't be doing because everyone will know quickly!!!
Every time you flash the picture of Jennifer all I can think about is that she looks as if she could be related to Richard Ramirez the Night Stalker.
ALEX MURDAUGH
Happy new year 2022
1:45 if you're here for the story and not the cringe
I love your hair here!
why powder on the brows!??!? Educate me!!!!!!
literally just made my day ily thank you
Not me, having graduated from ASU in San Angelo, TX, completely shocked hearing this story and Bailey saying ASU!
They should both have been given life w/o the poss of parole. Jmo
Oh my gosh I MISSED YOU BAILEY!!!! <3 <3
Bailey: Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer  Me: yes, Bailey, princess of darkness?
Was anyone else waiting for Lieutenant Joe Kenda to show up in this story?? 💔🤣
Yes I absolutely did get a suspish merch hoody for Christmas !!!
“ sweetie you should go back to prison , sorry about that ” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
CONGRATS ON 6mil 🥳💖
She’s backkk
Yay!! I was that excited for this, that I forgot the time difference. Jumped on to look for a notification and realised it was 07:30 PST 🙈. Can we find out more about Shawn Grate. He’s a strange case!
No one is above being manipulated
Happy new year beauitful ❤️
Yeah, he did that. It was obvious that she had been manipulated.  Kinda, makes it all obvious, yes?  Hey, Bailey 😎
Happy new year beautiful 😍
Yayyy your back I missed you !!🥰 love you💞
Waoww amazing very nice your video i like 👍❤🙏😍
Jeeeeeez Louise with these "religious" folk using religion to okay their sins LOL what a crutch.
I would love you to tell the story about a couple that were from Nebraska. They made a movie about them called natural born killers. Their names are charles starkweather and caril ann fugate.
Yay you did the "thank you thank you " again in your intro tehe I missed it :P  And your hair looks super duper cute!!!!!!! Hope you had a fab Christmas and New Year!
I’m so happy you’re back! Just yesterday I was thinking “when will Bailey upload again”
👏🏾GET👏🏾BETTER👏🏾IDOLS
You should do a video about Beulah Annan, she was the inspiration for the character Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago
slapping meats.....ahh, romance under gods eye!! noice!
"Let me think . . . no" Baileyy you make my day, gurlll 🤣🤣
love you, Bailey! Please do a video on the Bricca Family.
Here's my BFF 😄😄😄
No one ever talks about the video, in Bailey's comments, it's thousands of comments of ppl saying how much they love her.  That's fkg impressive. Edit. The majority anyway lol
Congratulations on 6 million subs Bailey 👏🏾
I believe it's either Ben or Jennifer who killed Diane cause when police asked them question they were suspicious to me
Are we bringing back butterfly clips too with this early 2000's fashion wave we're experiencing here?
I went to school in C-Springs…. Gotta tell you this all tracks correctly. Small, but sprawling
Your hair looks ssoo cute!! 💙💙❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💞💞💞💞💞💞
Colorado springs is beautiful but HELLA conservative. Like, dangerous conservative.
I always like the video just as the theme song starts haha always my favorite part
My Mom has Lupus. I'm borderline for it, and I also have Multiple sclerosis. 😭
Ooooh my baby bailey is back 🤩 let’s do the happy song sanasaaaaa sanasaaaaaaaa sanasasa sanasaaaaaaaaaaa I’m going to be enjoying this video ❤️
So great to have you back! Binged on your videos while doing laundry, lunch breaks at work, and well... anytime really 😁 now we get new episodes! Love ya!
WELCOME BACK BAILEY!!! so glad you're back. hope you're doing well <3
slapping meats together
I used to hate Monday’s, now they’re lo key one of my favorite days because I can cuddle my hubby and watch Bailey together
You should do the true story about Pain and Gain. Please and thank you 💝
I love u never stop doing this 🖤✨🖤✨🖤✨🖤✨
I missed you!!! And I miss your Saturday videos, please bring them back!
"wutoh" oh. I see you Orville. 🤣
Literally PERFECT timing. I'm about to start cooking dinner and I'm going to watch u knoweww thank you. Loovee yyouuu
I have such a sinus headache that brush looks so nice , I need one to massage my eye 👁
Colorado Springs is Awesome they have The Garden of the Gods beautiful scenery check it out super cool 😎
Mondays are infinitely better when there's a Bailey Sarian video ♥️
“The Peacemaker”…oh the irony 🤔😭
Colorado Springs being called a small town with 200,000 people  My hometown...50,000 🤣
“Slapping meats together “ 🤣🤣🤣
I live in Colorado Springs and your description cracks me up 🤣 I don’t think I would consider it a small town but somehow everyone knows everyone
Would love to have seen a cute lil pink lip with this whole look, to match the butterfly clips! 💙💖
It would be so cool if you could do something about pizza gate! It’s such a HUGE deep dive rabbit hole and it’s just so interesting and wild to even believe but proof is in the pudding. I have documents I could send to you too for research!!
Hi Bailey (=ﾟωﾟ)ﾉ been a big fan since i found you on fb you are funny and beautiful i was hoping if you see this comment by the 23rd (thats my bday) i was hoping i could get a hi one of your videos for my bday id so appreciate it and adore it (づ￣ ³￣)づ~♡ !! I apologize if its rude to ask so if i upset you just please ignore this comment then  ( ͒ ́ඉ .̫ ඉ ̀ ͒) and again im so so sorry (๑･᷄ὢ･᷅๑) . . .
I love that you here and it’s okay … I need to hear your voice today..❤️❤️
I LOVE YOU BAILEY!!! 😩
What in the Red Dead Redemption 2 gun is going on here? LOL Happy New Year Bailey! Glad to see you back.
I thought the term peacemaker for a gun was cause if you had a feud with someone, you could make peace by shooting them. Like it was a joke term that became more serious
Can you share the story of Stanley Hoss??   I enjoy listening  to your stories.
The mistress is not innocent, but the victim's husband is the monster in this story.
Hi Bailey & Happy New Year! May peace, longevity, prosperity, happiness, & love be your Blessings for many years to come! 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤😘
18:00 ,If its not the husband....then the secret lover of the husband
Isint the peace maker from a show called wynona?… its about demons and stuff … coinquidink? I think not!
Sound like an episode of Supernatural...the Peacemaker
I was thinking, "where's the insurance policy?", then Bailty says, "but...he took out an insurance policy..". LOL I think I'm watching too much true crime!✌😸
I love you Bailey!!
Missssses youuuuu!!!!! Hiiiiii!
What is up with their mugshots? 🥴
Glad to see you back again, hope all is well and that you had a wonderful holiday.. Can’t wait to listen to the pod cast here on Thursday, I’d rather see then just listen and not knowing the face and hand gestures.. I like it better when it’s live..
She's baaaaack. 2022 finally started. ♥️
Look into Reeva Steenkamp
Are you going to do a video on Jonbenet Ramsey?? Would love to hear your take on it.
Blessed New YEAR My friend 💕🐝 Missed ya!!!!! *theme song* 🎶🎵🥁
Awe.. my heart so happy reading all these nice comments.
Ahhhhh, the Peacemaker... from Wynona Earp?
6 Million 🥳🥳🥳 congratulations 🥳🥳🥳  I've been waiting for January 10th to arrive 🙌🏻
Ahhhh I’ve missed youuuu 🙏❤️
The Peacemaker could be/is literal 😆 Folks disturbing the peace, so you pull out your gun and the folks disturbing chills out when they see it 🤣
Why are their mugshots so creepy?!? :-O
90% of the women in prison are in prison because of some guy they got involved with.  had jennifer not met dreamboat brian, would she have spent a couple decades in prison?
I still love your background and the theme song is getting better every week 🤣
Manipulated? More like persuaded lol she made her choice buuuut he is just as guilty as her since he basically put a hit out on his wife🤷🏾‍♀️
IS THAT AUDREY 2 IN UR BACKGROUND
You should do Andrea Yates or the Hart family.
You make me run home to watch your videos on Mondays!
BS HIt 6MIL Y’all know that means devil illumination and the three mansons  I THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING NO MON VIDS FOR ALL OF JAN THANK U BBBS
I live here and I don’t think it’s a cute little town. I live in the af shriever base but my husband stationed at fort Carson and I’m super excited to finally leave ColorAdo springs lol
Danny Corwin. Have ya heard of him?
QUEEN BAILEY IS BACK YAAAAAAAAAAAAAS 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
Who else watches EVERY MM&M Monday Twice?? The first time I watch for tha Story. Then I watch again so I can see THE MAKEUP!!! 😍 Congratulations ON 6 MILLI!!! 🥳
Okay seriously am I the only one who thinks that Bailey's intro song sounds like she's saying Son of Sam ,Son of Sam Son of Saaaaamm LOL at least that's what I sing in my head everytime I hear it
I love you, that's what I think. 💕
Sorry. But i have to say. Just because the accused is a woman it does not mean shes less accountable..... If a lot of people who knew her trusted that she would be capeable of things like that. She probably is
both should have got equal time.. I believe
I'm home sick with Corona & this made my whole day 🤍🤍
As a Christian we do not claim him.
Bailey! Welcome back! Can you do the case about Mitchelle Blair who killed her daughter and son and stuffed them in the freezer?
Can't get enough of her "Update Brian come on in"🤣🤣
Wyatt Earp's gun was called The Peacemaker
Ahhhhh! Bailey’s Back 💕
Welcome back beautiful! Happy new year! Both should have done equal time!
You're not a liar, Bailey. You just told truth. Though some green screens... That's all I will say.
The look is giving me Bratz doll 😍
BUTTERFLY CLIPS
Bailey: Colorado Springs… Me: Gasp! Does Lieutenant Mike Kenda have a guest spot?! <total double fangirl moment>
Bailey. You're back!!!!
Your intro told me you were definitely ready for a vacation 🤣😅
“What in the time travel is going on? Are we in Clue?!” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don't believe he manipulated her, that's BS!!! She actually disguised herself, put the gun in her hand, waited for her victim to come outta her meeting, then she snuck up on her & pulled that trigger, not once but twice!!!!  Those 3 poor kids had to grow up w/o both parents!   They're both at fault, but he didn't "manipulate" her!!!
How does these people get out and the innocent people that have gotten locked up stay in jail I don't understand.
So happy to have bailey back as part of the Monday routine 💕💕💕
Thanx Bailey!  FYI, shooting a revolver is easier than a semiautomatic.... 😉
Jen+ben=bennifer 4ever
Both need to be in jail frfr
I should be watching this at work. Gods voice had me dead💀😂🤣😂🤣
Yassss!! You did the “thank you, thank you” after the theme song! I still say that part every episode even though it’s been quite awhile since you’ve included it lol Made my day 😁
AWE YIS
Missed you bailey! 💜
I am so glad you posted this you were missed lol
Bailey I luhhh you soo much. You’re such a vibe.
Can we just change the name Mon…day aka mundane to Bai…day!!! I was starting to dislike my Mondays until I creeped my YouTube for the 8th time and saw Bailey uploaded!!!!
Did you at least record it on a Monday 🤨😂
The Queen of true crime has come back! We missed you welcome back, love the video, can't wait for next week!
When it’s he said /she said we will never really know. Sadly.
It's 23:49 on Monday here but I'm here
So the husband now working as an insurance agent... 🤔
I'm always floored by religious peoples ability to excuse their own blasphemous behaviour but condemn others for doing the same thing
Yas Queen Myrder and Medical info
Yay, welcome back!!
Hey Lady! Welcome back u pretty little liar!😏 👋😆 gald to see the Queen has returned!  I can't wait for covid to get to endemic so we can FINALLY have a meet and greet! In the mean time u should consider doing a live (youtube?) So we can all just chat, flub around with makeup, and talk MMMM AND Dark History!  Your faithful day one folks miss those early grwm Saturday pick me ups!
Who else was binge watching Baileys older vids while she was on brake?!?!?...I know it wasn't just me cos Bailey is amazing!!
I missed you so bad!!! My hubby and I are here for YOU on MONDAY!
“slapping meats together” 🤣🤣🤣
From what I read,it was called the Peacemaker because it was easier for anyone to use it so they could defend themselves if needed
As a Jennifer, i kept jumping every time Jennifer... JENNIFER  was stated. i felt like I was in trouble....
Hey girl what about maybe doin Lizzy Borden or Sybel was a girl who had multiple personalities including 3 of the 15 or so were boys.its a very interesting article 🤔
OK I went down a rabbit hole of why it's called the peacemaker 🐰🕳️🤦‍♀️ still don't have a straight answer but there are a few interesting ones... Great to have you Bailey! Happy New Year x
My new year is starting off with having a rough case of COVID, so having MM&MM back is really helping! Love you Bailey!!
Yeah, welcome back sweetheart! And a happy new year to you & your loved ones, Miss Bailey. ❤️
Can you please make a video on Sierra Lamar
My name is Jennifer. I felt kinda attacked by this one... 🤣🤣🤣
Why is she smiling in her mugshot?
Big eye roll 🙄 hahahah
So proud of you for doing your own hair! I know the struggle girl!!! 😂
I get it I feel the same Bailey . I tried to tell somebody the other day that I wasn’t home and I felt so bad I called back and told them I lied .. lol
I’d appreciate it if you would stop making condescending remarks towards Christianity (“for JESUS” 5:07). This persons actions do not define the faith. If you allow yourself a condescending tone towards Christianity, please do that with every religion when it is discussed. Thank you.
These two definitely were working together. I can’t believe their plan was THAT sloppy after planning THAT long.
OH YES I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!!!
Hi Bailey I'm so excited to be so early ☺sending you love from Johannesburg, South Africa 🇿🇦❤
Here's my thoughts. Brian wants his wife dead, but purchase insurance prior. In order to be free from their partners Brian convinced Jenifer to do the work, because he is a coward and doesnt want blood in his hands. Telling Jenifer to use her husband's gun and clothes as weapon and disguise, maybe because they thoiuught that it won't be traced back to Ben, or if things go south they might actually pin it to Ben and eventually get rid of him as well, that would make both of them free to continue with their relationship. Unfortunately for them their affair was busted first and Jenifer confessed.
Love your content,  keep it going.
the title of this made me think of Knutby and the bride of christ, a swedish case. it's super interesting and since i'm swedish i would love to help you with any swedish translations if you ever wanna cover a swedish case! <3
I love your videos! Your makeup looks so beautiful!!! This case is crazy! Jennifer was an adult with her own mind that she knew right from wrong, but we don’t know if Brian mentally messed with her! They both should have gotten life! I don’t understand our justice system! It’s so broken! I feel terrible for the children!!!! That’s who really paid the price for their ridiculous plan! Could you do the case of Breana Nix?
Can we talk about how happy they looked in the mug shots...disgusting
'Guess who's back? Back again, baileys back, tell a friend! Yes she's back, Yes she's back, yes she's back, yes she's back, wooohooooo' :D. My eldests sons birthday today and bailey is back after what feels like a life time. Welcome back @baileysarian we've missed you
'slapping meats' 😂😂😂😂😂💀
Ah, all is right with the world. Our beloved Bailey is back. Aqua Tofanaaaaa *in sultry whisper*
Girl I want to know that color of nail polish you are wearing!?! Love the makeup and story too.
"Jennifer" is my real name. Every time she said it, felt like Bailey was scolding me.
It should have been equally split the time!!! Most definitely he was just as much part as she was!!! Love you Bailey
I stop watching Baileys videos for a couple months, just so I can come back and binge-watch all of the new ones in two days...anyone else? 😂
I love this look bestie 😍 what brush did you use for the foundation?
Both my mom and sister have lupus and it's  not talked about very much so thank you Bailey for giving out some very useful info on the disease. It mainly affects white women in their 20-40's  and has no cure or decent treatment. Pretty much just short term steroid use during flares and anti inflammatories such as advil to help reduce swelling and pain. Lifestyle changes to reduce stress work best but we all know hard that is to do
Happy New Year Bailey I went to the Pandarosa can you please do a story on Cynthia Phillips.
yay!!!
Hi Bailey 👋happy Fn new year I pray 🙏it was awesome and that you and ur honey enjoyed it together ❤
That man is clearly the master puppeteer.  He gave her the Kool-aid and she drank it.  He should still be doing time.
I haven't watched yet but I just wanted to say I MISSED YOU. These last few Mondays were not the same 🙃🙃🙃
I have missed this time with you 🔪🧐💄 Why the heck was that nut job smiling in her police photo? 😳😂🤣
She ran through my back yard after she shot her
Welcome back! Happy New Year to you, too! This may be a it of a stretch, but I actually have 3 suggestions to pick from: Pierre-François Lacenaire, Henri Désiré Landru, and Eugene Weidmann. I'm so sorry if this is an overload. I couldn't decide which one.
Love your videos 💙
Slappin meats together 😂😂
Happy New Year Bailey! The Queen of YT is back!
I saw this episode of Homicide Hunter and I'm so happy you covered it!!! 😁😁
I am just guessing ,But I'll bet the husband was a member of the LDS. Those men stick together.
Yaaaaaay!! Queen Bailey has arrived 😍 🔪
Your hair is very cute.
literally LOVEEEEE how you tell stories!
Happiest New Year, Bailey! Best day I have had so far this year. ☺
People in the comments: “My dog died this morning his head fell off BUT THANK YOU FOR POSTING ITS MADE MY DAYYY”
I've never heard anyone talk about this case on any of the true crime channels or podcasts but it happened and this woman is out of jail and FREE today.  Marjorie Congdon - she was adopted by a rich woman in Duluth, MN to a very well know family but to say she is the black sheep is the understatement of the century. Check her story out - Marjorie Congdon
I marked my calendar. I said Bailey returns Jan 10!!!! Yay!!!!!!
Watching this and keep hearing my name yelled by Bailey is the best 😂
G A S P A R E L L A
“Slapping meats together” 💀
I would advise you to learn more about guns and gun safety and proper gun education it's important for people to understand how to use a gun responsibly and being a responsible gun ownership
Your telling me Ben didn’t have a gun form like this century he had to give her a dinosaur gun form a million years ago. When the guy collets guns.  He didn’t give one f about her safety
Happy new year Bailey. Very happy seeing your face again 🎉❤️🌹👏💐🎊😁😊
Karen Hearn Slover killed by her ex and his parents! Terrible case in Illinois revolving around a custody dispute over their son.
Bailey! I looked through your videos and see you haven’t done one on Susan/josh Powell. The story has a lot of turns and ends very tragically 😭 but I’d love to hear you talk about it! The family is from my local area too
ARE THEY LAUGHING IN THEIR MUGSHOTS! Oh these people..
The queen has returned
First day at my new and intimidating job, all I could think about is if Bailey would post today.   Thanks for the anxiety wash away sis 🙏🏻
awe bailey our shirts are matching today🥰
She’s back!!!!!😍😍
Bailey is the most loved and unproblematic person on the interwebs! WE STANN A QUEEN 👑❤️
"It's usually the spouse" and "follow the money". Sounds like a broken record sometimes. Scary how often it happens.
Don’t ever change your theme song….EVER.Thank you!!
can you look at ivan milat ( in australia), or Father maskell
They both deserved worse tbh
Thank goodness your back! I missed your beautiful face every Monday for my favorite series on YouTube! Okay, I’m going to watch now!
Bailey, I swear, you ALWAYS, ALWAYS look fierce and phenomenal af. You should totally do a segment like this but with hair cause I looooove the way you can do yours but could definitely use a majestic guide like you cause the only thing I can do with my hair is either leave it down or in a messy bun, it gets boring 😢 Not only that but itd be perfect with the crime stories 😄❤😄
Missed you, Beautiful!! Been watching my notifications for you for DAYS!!!  Hope the holidays were oh so kind to you!! Marcella xoxo
It’s my birthday and I also have Covid, so this is the perfect remedy for me today!
Other youtubers: change their outfit and pretend they are filming another video on a different day Bailey: doesn't change the background and says she's a liar because she filmed this before her break
I -like the Peace Maker- love getting cocked before firing .
I’m so early🙌! Hi bailey!
Yay minday bedtime story
Do one on Isabel Celis from Tucson Az
Eye fricking roll! I love it! Love you Bailey
Should’ve gotten equal times in prison. Both life
I'm so glad you posted a MM&M. I adore you but I'm not crazy about Dark history
"Slappin' meats together".......I'm using this 👏👏
congrats on 6mil btw!!! youve grown so much
Happy to see you back ♥️♥️♥️
Please never get rid of the theme song 🙌🏻
Hooray! So happy to have you back 🥰🥰🥰
Welcome back, Pretty! Yeah, both deserved their sentences, but Bryan should have been kept in until he died in prison. But that's just me and my limits on "religious" people and their creatively unreligious use of religion to justify their crimes.
Can you do an episode about Billy Milligan ?
Its my birthday!!!!! 18!!!! honestly this is the best gift i could have been given, THANK YOU!!!
“ we gotta stop making comments on people and how perfect they are “ THISSSSS!!!!! Facts
Bailey: 250k I guess it's a small town.  My town: 5k people.  Me: 😳👀
Anyone else like her videos before she even gets through her first line of the intro? I just know it’s going to be an amazing video!!!
Why did you have to say Jennifer like that😂 I felt like I was in trouble 😂😂
Yay! I missed you Bailey ❤️
Missed you bestieee❤️
I missed you ❤️ glad you're back
What a f**king winner 🤣🤣
So excited to see you back, and crazy to hear a story from my hometown !
I don't think he 'manipulated' her per se, i think she agreed diane had to be out of the picture and the way bryan presented the idea to jennifer sounded reasonable to her. So, in other words, I would say he 'convinced' her. But what do i know haha
I'M SO GLAD UR BACK🙂💕!! I have to say this has been the LONGEST few weeks ever!!😂 I can only watch the old videos so many times 😆 and when I am talking along with you thru the ones I've rewatched that's my sign to let it go and give it up until you have new videos to watch😂
Equally guilty but I do think she was a bit naive
Your makeup looks beautiful!
ayyeeee its my bday too!! great vid as always :))
Bailey 💙💙 we missed you so much ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
City of 500,000, Bailey refers to as a “small town”. I grew up in a town of 400, the capital of the province I come from has a population of about 110,000 and our entire province has only 500,000 people. I cannot wrap my brain around a city of 500,000 people being a “small town”. Also, why can a town with a handful of people be called a city in the US? Genuinely curious :)
So glad you're back. Monday's were tough without you.
you should do a video on Harold Shipman , would love to see it :)
Slapping meats 😂😂 love this
Gorgeous!
I pride myself on ending the theme song when Bailey does and the last little bit threw me off this time 😂
The fact I have memorized her intro.....
FINALLY
I'm So glad you're back! Love you Bailey!!
Just so you know...250,000 people in a town is NOT a small town. Not even close.
WELCOME BACK
Bruh my name Jennifer 😔
why is god's plan by drake playing in  my mind every time you say god's plan 🙄
Finally we missed you 😩😩!!
Congrats on 6 milli❤️
I’m having such a horrible day, this just made me stop crying and smile so big 😁 thank you Bailey!
6millionnnnn Yeahhhhhh!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
“Hey, Brian! COME ON IN” LOL Bailey, I love ya!
WHY didn't anyone attack the gunman? How many ppl sat & watched this take place and did nothing 🥺
Yay welcome back!!
“Babe I want a gun “😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣got me wheeezing
MONDAYS ROCK AGAIN!! <3
Ahhhh!!! I've missed you so much. I've been struggling mentally and your videos bring me so much serotonin. I liked the video before it even started lol
I was diagnosed with Lupus in 2020. Once it started attacking my heart, causing heart failure, I went from managing a dispensary to assisted showers/drivers license revoked/fighting for disability within 6 months. It was neat hearing you explain it in the beginning THANK YOU as it's still very unknown and I've lost many friends/family to thinking "I'm faking it". I cant imagine just how much extra painful it was for that poor woman to try crawling away after being forced to the ground 😪. What a great (wrong word but you know what I mean) story. Bailey you can lie to me any day haha you're so gorgeous congrats on 6mil!
Bailey, please dont ever change! You're amazing and Im loving those butterfly clips gooorrrrllllll🥰😍
Yes she is back we missed u
Happy new year Bailey, all the best for you and your loved ones in 2022!  "Fidel Lopez" is a frightfully gruesome case darling, one of the most gruesome I've read about. If you have the stomach for it I think you would find it interesting. Blessings from Scotland 🙏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🥃
🥂 HAPPY NEW YEAR 🍾 ♥️ from Chicago
If you took a self defense class you would understand fire arms so much more, the amount of time you spend talking about guns, I believe you speculate about thing that maybe you need educated about
Not a church leader. He knew better, and deserved to be locked up. Ole girl, is guilty as well. Love the make-up look!
Haha this makes me so happy!! Welcome back
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Slapping meats together 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I got that shirt for Christmas
WHAT IS THIS CLUE?! And yes def karma, she killed someone with a painful disease and so she died of one. Come on lol
Yayy we missed you 😍
She was dressed with her husbands clothes n used his gun. She was tryina set him up! Lol
YAAAY!!!!! IM SO EXCITED!! SHES BACK EVERYONE! SHES BACK! THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!💛💛💛💛💛💛
SIX WEEKS of deliberation?!
Bailey looks like a Bratz doll with this makeup and I love it 😍
Me just lounging around in my Bailey "aqua tofana" merch ❤❤❤
Little kitty cats 🐱 ha cute Bailey happy new year 🎉🎈☮️🌹
I’m just thinking about how much I am loving this look and I realized it’s because I do a similar one. What a narcissist I am. Ah, well. Love you, Bailey! 💋
so the police are like "yay" 😂
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hello your majesty!!! Pleased to see you!!!
Oh, hey bestie! Love to have you back, now I can properly fall asleep and watch this again tomorrow.
Slapping meats😭💀💀💀💀
This sounds like the beginning of the daybell case. Why are all these turds involved in church. BTW your makeup and hair brings me back to the 90s. Love it.
I'm so glad you're back beautiful lady  I missed you
The smiling mugshots are sooo creepy!! Both should have been held equally accountable
Please do the NXIVM cult and their sorority DOS!!🥺🥺
You should do a story on Diane downs
Please do your next video on the Brooklyn vampire!
Army wife in Colorado Springs this is crazy
I been watching her videos all day. Because I been sick all day….ironically it’s true crime and some of the videos are more graphic 😂
That picture of Brian was very much a jumpscare
"Slapping meats together"💀😂💀
Great story! Hope your vacation is going great.. Please do a story on Barbara Woolworth Hutton! The Woolworth heiress. It's so CRAZY!
My mom died of pancreatic cancer she was diagnosed with it two months before she died the way I understand it is there is no cure for pancreatic cancer if you get pancreatic cancer you will die simple as that
Yaayyyy 6M subs Bailey... Congrats dear!
Hi Bailey. Please look into the Kim Wall /nautilus submarine case. Im here if you need translation 😊 Best regards and thank you for great content as always. Been a  Sub for some years now ☺️🍀
"Slapping meats" this is a vivid description, glad I wasn't drinking something when she said that. Freaking LOVE BAILEY!
ok shut up bc my family is from Colorado Springs and my grandpa owned the main flower shop in town….
Kind of had a L Vallow vibe. Great MU, loved your eyes! Peace~
Running to the comments to see if any of you fancy detectives out there know where “ole Bri” is😂  Sure did miss Monday’s, my day is so much better now!
“Brian, cmonnn in 😃” 😂😂😂😂😂
I"ve been waiting for thisssss, just in time for my birthday month haha
Happy 6 milli!!!
5 mins in… the husband hired a hit man.   Nope, jealous mistress. I should have known
you need to do a video on the crystal rogers case!!!
Why were other people standing around watching her being executed?
My guess is it was the mistress on the street with the revolver! Had to because of the Clue comment 🤣
Mike Williams Florida case!
LOVE the hair. Super cute. Missed your amazing videos!
I LOVE BAILEY 🥲❤️ she’s so friggin charming and funny!
Seen her gravesite  🌹☮️💕😢😢
Miss girl we missed you :,) welcome back Bailey! 💜😌💅
Just in time 🙏 I was about to watch reruns but new video is UP 😁😁
YEEEESSSSSSS! I've been waiting for my girl!
The theme song sounds like "Son of Sam. Son of Sam. Son of Sha-sha-shanah Sam" and I want it as my ring tone.
This in my town Colorado Springs
Ur hair is frigging-cute! Happy New Year, dear! 💐🏵🌹
So excited you're back and congratulations on 6M!!
I hope you had a wonderful holiday and a happy new year but I’m super glad your back 💞.
I appreciate your hair! It gorge! Love you 💕💕💖💖
I missed this
Congrats on 6mil Bailey! ♥️🥳
happy 6 million bailey we love u so much im so proud of u
Hi, friend 🥺 Missed you 💓
Bailey I just want to say your absolutely beautiful and amazing! Plus I wanted to mention that I love watching your videos and have for awhile, but now I watch you every 3 hours lol. I just had a baby who is in NICU and when I’m home pumping breast milk I watch your videos to keep me awake and occupied so I love the 20-25 min videos you post since it’s the perfect amount of time while pumping. My suggestion to you is to post more videos about true crimes of victims getting abducted and hopefully found such as Jaycee Duggard, etc. I know this was mentioned to you before but those are the true crimes that are crazy to me and how they were able to survive that. It shows the strength of people. Just a thought. I hope you have a great 2022! Keep being you!!
I haven’t watched the full video yet but it’s great to see you back Bailey. You always make my Mondays and your theme song always makes me happy. Thank you Bailey, you’re the best person ever.
Welcome back Bailey. Happy and a very blessed New Year. Hope you are well.  I had to smile. As soon as I saw the picture in the thumb nail. I actually knew you the person. Although, I know I'm going to learn something new from you as always 🥳🥳🥳
Literally best bday present ever
The both should have gotten LIFE
🤣💖Don't care if U lie teacher, WELCOME BACK!!!💖😘
I know we like it so much more when it's all the guys fault but you got to admit Bailey she's just as freaking guilty as he is they're both ate up a pair of real s*** heads
Also… super loving the clips girl!
Today was my first day back to school and I've just really been dreading it so watching you is making it so much better 😄
As soon as you hear ' deeply religious', or Born Again Christian, you just know its not ending well And what was with their booking photos? They looked like they were at Disney land 😁 OK, Miss Bailey, when are you REALLY back, hmmm?
Bailey if you somehow see this PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me where you got that Audrey 2 in your background T_T I've been looking for a legit one for so long. I even caved bought a bootleg one and it got lost in the mail  Yours is so cool looking
Bailey: "Colorado Springs, it's supposed to be a nice cute area"  Me: *watches Joe Kenda and knows better*
welcome back Bailey miss u great hair btw
Happy to have you back Bailey! Did you ever  hear about Roch Theriault? It's a wild cult story that happened in Québec. Would love to hear your thoughts about it 🖤
WHAT! An hour ago!! I’m so excited!!!! These give me life… so weird considering….. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
Bailey, you HAVE to go to Colorado Springs, and go to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo 💯🥰😎 it’s my HAPPY PLACE
Happy Monday 🥳 so glad to have you back 😁💕 Best day of the year so far ❤️
I’m pretty sure that any revolver needs to be recaulked and then you have your automatic guns which would be like your Glocks
What hair extensions are these?! 💖
My Dog's name is Brian, so when in the end you were saying about Brian and kept repeating his name my dog was like... Me? What?... I'm here hi 👋 😅
Yes! She’s back! Gosh it’s been too long lol. We missed you bestie ❤️  Edit: CONGRATS ON 6 MILLION FOLLOWERS! You deserve it! ❤️❤️
Hey bailey. Can you please cover the story of randy stair. ?
Can you do “Luis Andres Colmeres”? This is a very messed up one that leaves you out with lots of questions…
WE’RE BACK YEEEEEEE
Our queen is back🙌🙌
Bailey! How I’ve missed you😩
Hi Bailey 🥰😝😎 yay it’s Monday again. FINALLY 🤣
I always sing the thyme song w her 🤣
My boyfriend months ago : Enjoy Bailey I'm going to game. My boyfriend now : YOU CAN'T WATCH BAILEY WITHOUT ME 😂 Welcome back ❤️ hope you had a lovely Christmas
Yippee ur back😁
Ahhh yay Bailey's back! congrats on 6mil! Mondays are now exciting once again!! Thank you!
6 MILLION!!! WOW Bailey,  Congrats!!!
Ok but you are hair goals!!  I wish!
Today I was told that I’m having a miscarriage and you’re the only thing that has put a smile on my face today
Love from Kurdistan 🥰🥰 it’s midnight and i LOVE you
Oh my gawd! I am so thankful you are back! It felt empty without our Bailey dose.
So glad you're back! I think they are equally guilty. Like you said the life insurance policy says it all.
Yes Bailey your back! This is the highlight of my day and then to top it off you're doing a story from my hometown! I love you and hopefully you can come to Colorado Springs and see how Charming it is!
This is an absolutely perfect birthday gift, THANKS BABE 👑❤️✨
YAAASSSS QUEEN OF THE DARK IS BACK 🦇🖤🖤
I don't think she believed everything he said but I do believe that he said it and was the instigator so I think they should both have gotten life
Please do the story of Russel Williams. I’m from the area.
Do not look at this man as an example  of Christianity. It is said that Christians can be forgiven of any sin, but one. This is not it. So look at Jesus Christ as the example of how Christians should live.
not me hoping you'd say "she was IN TOO DEEP" (sum 41 song) when you said, "she's has no way out of this babe, she is in.. no way out"
AHHHH!! She’s back!!
happy new Year Bailey Sarian and I wish for 2022 a healthy and beautiful year for you 💓. I am from the Netherlands and have only discovered you since 4 weeks. I will get through the coming weeks (lockdown here in the Netherlands) with your videos!👍 I learn so much from your videos. true crime and make up. You are a beautiful person! Big hug from nathalie from the Netherlands 💗
Yes thank you. Lol I needed this today
Nice one. Have you done make-up while telling the story of Anjette Lyles of Macon, Georgia who killed two husbands, a mother-in-law,and her daughter in the 1950s? It's small-town Southern Gothic at its best. <3
Yay!!!! Happy New Year!!! So glad you're back!! I missed you!!!!!! ❤
Best way to wakeup on a Tuesday 😍😍😍😍
🥳🥳🥳 aww, great to have you back!!  *** Recommendation for a story is FRED & ROSEMARY WEST from Gloucester, U.K.  💚🧡💚🧡🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Missed you! ❤️
Happy new year! We love you
SLAPPING MEATS 🤣🤣
Best thing about Monday's, Bailey. Let's chat up some books sometime.
Bailey is back!  It is officially now a very Happy New Year! :D
I think he defo put the idea in her head at the very least 😬 why don’t people just leave? Like go be with your mistress happily ever after please and leave the wife alone 😅 like, can she live???
I think she was manipulated
My dad is dieing of pancreatic cancer right now. It's a horrible painful way to go
She’s back, baby 🥳
I'd love to see you do a story on Heidi Peterson. Disappeared in the '70's in Seattle,WA at 8 years old. As far as I know, there are no suspects, and the case has never been solved.
JEEEEEEEEEEENIFER
🤍
Waited for this 😭🤍 love u bails
Hey There Bailey!!!!
glad ur back great story!!!!! he should have gotten the same sentance .
I LOVE the butterfly clips!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
Yasssss!!!!
Bailey: It wasn't the husband My Brain: If it wasn't the husband it was the husband's mistress. I'm still watching but that's my guess
Crazy story.   Great to see you girl!  🦋🦋🦋🦋
I’ve literally missed you sooo sooo much😭 welcome back!😍😍😍
Congratulations on 6 million!! Now to 7!!
Well I can tell you the people in Pueblo co are super rude and Ignorant the people in Colorado Springs a little bit nicer and educated
Hello Beautiful. Hope you had a great holiday.
I watched Ghost Adventures about this place called St. Ann's (or Anne's) retreat in Utah. There is a huge true crime story element to it and a paranormal angle. You should check it out! Love me some Bailey!!!!
Bailey! Please speak about the weird case of Dulce Maria Alavarez disappearance.
WooHoo Bailey 🍹🍹🍹🍹✌️💚😎🌴🌊☀️🌈🌺
I recommend Edward paisnel the beast of Jersey,  and Richard chase the vampire of Sacramento.
It’s so weird hearing Bailey talk about my home town! 💖
So happy your back !!!!!  Have you heard about Fred and Rose West ?  Have you heard about Myra Hindley and Ian Brady ?
Bailey, youre a queen. we love you! but can you do a video over sharon tate?
I would love to hear your views on the Donna Mae Jokumsen case
My Gurlllllll!
I heard love peace joint. Makes sense as well, brought back the 60s
I saw this on deadly women
❤ this mami..... happy New year Bailey ❤🧿
Where do I send case suggestions
I feel like people saying that bailey is the only thing that gets then through is alot of pressure. Even if its not serious, still alot i feel for her to have on her mind.
You should talk about Dellen Millard! Crazy story
The thumbnail, I thought Bailey is going to talk about Ina Garten.🤣
She’s back 🙀
Yay! You've been missed. Happy New Year!
Heyyyyyy🥰🥰🥰 I love your videos❤❤❤
13:23
YOU’RE BAAAAACK HEHEHEHEHEH
“Slapping meats together” 🤣
bailey!!! you should do a video on the Jamison family! it’s a super interesting case about a disappearance of a family!
Saw this video and started smiling immediately *click* 🥰
Bailey please do James Bulger next Monday.
Omfg where have you been😭😭 miss you boo!
SLAPPING MEATS TOGETHER? BAILEY 🤣🤣🤣🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
i fkn love when bailey impersonates a group of men lol, this is straight comedy
Biiiiiiiiish I’ve missed you! Glad you’re back but also glad you took a break and take the time you need to chill and not work! Thanks for everything you do Bailey, it is MUCH APPRECIATED!! 🥰🤗
moral of the story: don't have an affair. leave your partner if they have an affair, if you wanna stay alive.
6M!!!!❤️❤️❤️🎉
Yass my bestiesss back ehehe!! Happy new year 💞😊!!
Dennis Depue next! The real Jeepers Creeper
Missed you 👸🏻
Or Teresa Knorr?
As a Colorado Springs native, my heart jumped in my throat when you said my town 🤣🤣 come on over your so welcome
I’m here for the theme song 🎵😁
.... just as friends tho....  🙃
Missed you queen!!
Its 5 am in the Philippines and im watching this hahahaha
Bailey you TRIPPIN’!!!! It’s ALWAYS the husband 😂😂😂
He was probably experiencing shock and grief at the same time which is a new experience for military men
„Science…“ Almost missed it, so glad I didn’t. Welcome back, gorgeous, I’ve been counting the days!
Yay your back! I think they both deserve to stay in prison. They took a mother, someone's daughters life. She is our here minding her business meanwhile they are having an affair than plan and act out taking her out in a parking lot. Nope No you both deserve to have your freedom revoked.
😊😊😊 it's the theme song for me...so original and catchy 🥰🥰🥰
And having experienced military towns, this is so strange. Of course there’s outliers always but definitely an odd case
How about Milligan or Mulligan, the guy with 24 personalities?
Love this! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bailey: Brian’s out.  Me: whoa whoa whoa….🤚🏽 pump the brakes sis….*proceeded to announce 5 versions of a conspiracy where Brian is involved* 😂😂😂
I always look forward to Mondays because of you, Bailey!! Thanks for interesting videos always! Technically it is already Tuesday here when your videos get uploaded. Haha
I live in Colorado Springs and you kinda got it right in the description lol but it is very beautiful here and yes even though it’s described as a big city we are a small city and everyone pretty much knows everyone lol
The bystander effect is something I will never get over.
My cooking companion is back 😁👏🏼
I’m so hooked. Listen to you at work and on my way home. My son knows the theme song now and tries doing it with you 🤣🤣🤣
Welcome back!! I hope you had an amazing holiday!! Love your explanation of the peacemaker ❤
Love uuuuuuu
I forgot today is Monday !!!
Missed you Bailey! Glad you’re back💕
Me refreshing my YouTube all Monday until a new Bailey Sarian video appears.
I think it’s a peace maker because you have time to make peace with your maker…maybe. Not peace with the other person. That’s what I always heard anyway. So glad you’re back!!!
If you come to Colorado Springs,  hit me up girl! 😜😘
Slappin meats… took me to out!
shannashaaa shannashaahhhhh shannashashashanashaaaaa
Another clue the police used to find out it was a woman, was the way Jennifer threw the purse over her arm after she turned to run. A man doesn’t carry a purse the same way a woman does. That was one of the very first clues caught by witnesses that was a red flag of it not being a man.
This new episode feels like I'm having a lunch date with my bestie (I'm actually eating lunch rn!) and she's catching me up with everything she knows about this messy couple!
You're such a little doll. I have always loved your snarky little remarks while you tell the stories.
Bailey, have you ever done Diane Downs or Darlie Routier?
So glad your back!!! 💖 Can you do John Rowe from Lockport IL. He was my teachers son when the case happened.
Love it when she uses her makeup sponge as a pretend phone!😂
You should definitely check out Albert Fish.. I just finished reading a book on him, absolutely mind boggling!
Shout out from Colorado Springs! You should come visit the winery in the Old Bathhouse in Manitou Springs. I think you might be interested in doing a Dark History episode about the Bathhouse and Emma Crawford.
Missed you love you ❤️ peace love joy yay
Wow.  Pancreatic cancer is terrible.  Karma got her in a bad way.  Now, the grieving widower smirking in all those mug shots?  Karma needs to bitchslap him double time.
Jennifer and Brian's mug shots-are they for real??!! They have big happy smiles. Crazy
Born and raised in the springs, I can give you allllllll the dirt in this town
I want Bailey to say “egscape” in every video 😬
Happy New Year Bailey!!
I love Monday’s because of you ♥️
@bailey Talk about Annabel Rose
What is WRONG with people?!! Oh, missed you by the way. Hope your break was wonderful. I need to be finding that lip color.....it's too fabulous! I would love to hear your take on Josh and Susan Powell. Her body has still not been found.
Butterfly clips for the win. 🦋🦋🦋
Legit you’re so amazing ! Such a pleasure to have you back Bailey ❤️❤️
We've missed you!
HEY EVERYONE,HAVE A GREAT DAY ✨
Instant LIKE! I really like these best. Miss them!!
Please do Ariel Castros case from Cleveland, Ohio!
23:00 Bailey Sarian coming in to save our broken 2022.
They were swolemates!
Welcome back!  I hope you had a very nice break away.
Yaaaayyyyy Bailey!
Less than an hour after posting and 1K comments already 😳 Crazyyyy. You deserve it tho Bailey you're a queen 👑
HI FRIENDDDDDDDP
Just made my Monday so much better!!!!❤️❤️❤️
Bailey, you got 6 million followers!  Congratulations!  You deserve it!
Girlll I missed you so much hhhhhhhh hhhh
Your videos make me look forward to Mondays, so glad you're back sis
When Bailey said "it wasn't the husband". Me:. "ye right" 🤣 Hail the queen is back..  👏🎉
Just as you said, “Look you little kitty cats” my cat meowed at me. Clearly she’s just as excited as I am to see you return
Where’s Brian now?   Well he’s out here in the dating cesspool of course. Lol.  On one of the dating apps I’m sure 🙄
You should cover the Kim Wall case (“the submarine case”). It’s wild, and horrific.
Congratz on 6 million subs its amazing! You Are amazing 😍 so glad your back Queen 😍
Covid finally got me this weekend... this is exactly what I needed ❤
I saw Bailey Sarian wearing a tie dye Suspish T-shirt so I bought a tie dye Suspish T-shirt… & a pink one.. & a crewneck. 👀😂😂❤️
Yay you are back!! We missed you Bailey!❤️🥰
The song this week👌🏻
❤
Yay my Monday is now filled
Karma.
Not Bailey pulling up on a Monday. 😳
Love the theme tune still always
I have lupus! I take chemo for it. I'm always sick. You are the first person I've heard even talk or try to explain lupus. Thank you for bringing awareness 😍❤️
JUST DIVORCE HER. JUST. I hate people. I hate them so much.
When your favorite person shows up on YouTube!!! 😁😁😁
With the day I've had, seeing your face pop up is exactly what I need :) I can't wait to watch! Hope you enjoyed your break.
Your hair clips look like a crown and low key dig it.
It's so awesome to have Bailey back! ❤🥺 My Mondays are actually kinda awesome cuz I have Bailey AND orchestra rehearsals. It's nice to not have to hate Mondays like so many people do lol
Both of them smiling in their mug shots is weird!!! 🙄
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT
I clicked on this video so fast 😂 love Bailey
My BFF!! LOL!! Soooooo Excited!
BAILEY! I MISSED YOU!
i went to ASU, small town san angelo, grew up there💀💀 you got too close to come Bailey
Love your background Bailey!
I discovered you in 2021, and I’ve been binge watching your videos since! Happy new year!
Does anyone else sing the theme song with her every time
It made me so happy to get the notification of your video! Now 2022 can officially start.
Love ❤ this channel
Happy New Years Bailey❤️
I don't know the husband switched over to insurance the next thing you know his wife is dead seems suspish...lol
Every time Bailey says "JenniFER" I feel guilty. I wasnt even there 😂😂
You’re BAAAACCCKKKKK!!!! YAY!❤️
Looove the butterfly clips! 🗣✨
Congratulations on 6 million!!!
Bailey hit 6 million !!!
I'm sick and idk if i have the virus so I'm just quarantined and i was SO miserable till i saw this pop up in my sub feed ❤ thank you bailey
Can you please, please, please do a makeup tutorial where you’re explaining what you’re using and how you use it? 🙏🏻
Talk about Pamela Hupp please
I just opened my phone and took me right to YouTube and Bailey video 😂 love ya Bailey ☺️✨
It's so wonderful to see you back♡♡♡ The guy in this case Def put that woman up to i!! Like you said he did get life insurance on his wife. Let's just hope the new wife doesn't get in his way!!! And hope to see you in Dark History!!! ♡♡♡♡
Welcome back! Whether it’s taped before or after means nothing! Glad you are here!!!
Missed you Bailey!! Happy new year
Today is my first day of this college semester, and I needed a Bailey video after going brain dead doing math.
Don’t get married. It’s always the spouse or their mistress.
The PURE EXCITEMENT when I got the notification that you’re back !! Ugh I’ve missed you haha ❤️
Yayyyyuuyyyy
WOW 6 million subscribers 🎉 My biggest flex in life is that I’ve been subscribed since 200K 😂 Congratulations Bailey!! You deserve it! I love now that when I bring your name up to other people, they know who I’m talking about so I don’t have to describe how amazing you are.
"I can google it, but I like my assumption better"
A revolver isn't a fast gun to use, but it really isn't that slow lol
Bailey it’s my birthday 🥳 and you have a new video 🖤🖤🖤🖤 can I get a happy birthday from the queen 👑
YES! ... Bailey so cheers me up! Hmmm I wonder how it feels having 6 million BFF'S
The Queen 👸 is back with 6m congratulations 🎊 👏
Man go on. Take my purse. You about to get some gum and chapstick.
The Queen has arrived 😍
HELLO BAILEY SYRIAN 😁😁👋👋💯💥💥💥HOPE YOU HAD A GREAT BREAK❤ BAILEY..BEST NEW YEARS EVER ‼️‼️
Oh my gosh you finally here I've missed you so much that I started binging MM&M once again
That life insurance policy is a HUGE RED FLAG 🚩 🚩🚩🚩 for ol Brian!
finally happy new year hope you had a great one
Hey Bailey I just love your channel. I think you should talk about Vincent Brothers or about Orrin and Orson the 2 kids that have been missing since before Christmas of 2020. Not a lot of people know about this case I bet but it's really sad because the adoptive parents are still out and living life. They live in the town I live in Bakersfield and this is where the kids were born. I would love it if you could shed some much needed light on this situation. It might help the police and FBI find these boys and arrest their adoptive parents thank you. 😊
Happy 6M subscribers, Bailey ❤
The Peacemaker was the gun Doc Holliday had or something right? Idk sounds so familiar to me!!
None of them was manipulated. She thought he was stupider he improvised better when she confessed.
I love your shirt! I have one just like it! 😜 Ugh, I'm a dork.
Sad kitty cat.  All the Bailey merch in my size is sold out.
YAAAASSSSSS Bailey is BACK! 🙌🤩🎉  Congrats on the 6M subs! 👸
Jennifer sounds like a real life Harley Quinn for receiving more punishment for the crime planned with her boyfriend lol
WE LOVE U ....WHO CARES WHEN U FILMED THIS
I lived in Colorado in the nineties and vaguely remember this story. Most people who followed the case thought he was guilty as sin. Happy New Year Bailey! We love you!
I miss your Saturday's GRWM chats! We need an update about your life! How ARE you?
I’m glad you’re back
WERE BACK I MISSED YOUUUUUUU
Woman! I literally jus came on checking for ur content and.... nothing. Then 30mins later voila!!! ❤️❤️🇯🇲🇯🇲 Love your energy, Mama
Whew Chile I needed this TADAY
HAPPY NEW YEAR ❤❤❤❤
i was laying down to take a nap but I saw this so now…. Ima get the popcorn.
Thank the stars for Mondays 🙌
❤❤
It's a remake of a old western gun it's a revolver you have to pull back the hammer everytime you use it .
Nice to see you back girl! 💔 hoping u can take my mind off my gorgeous cat 💔 He passed away in my arms last Monday outside vets. I’m beyond devastated. Can’t stop crying 😭 Hope your all having a better start to your year than me 😭😭 I’m lost. He slept with me & was with me 24/7 💔💔 he was only 5
There were witnesses but no one did anything?

Yyayyyy ur back
Hellooooo I miss you so so much <333
6 million! Girl 2 words Aqua tofana
We missed you Bailey!!!! Thank you for doing these videos, we appreciate you💜
check out Liysa Northon... from Baywatch to prison...
Heeeyyy.  Missed ya! You make my Mondays and Thursdays. Thanks Bailey!!!!🥰🥰🥰
You make a great point by saying "stop making comments about couples being perfect!!"
This Southern gal has missed you!
To be honest, I'm so bad at displaying emotion, to the point where, i feel like the police will be like ,"mmhmmm, yup, this bish is the one. She's real suspicious." Cause if I try to show anything, it looks so overdone 😂😂
I know it’s been covered by many people, but I, and I know others want to hear your opinion and share the story of JonBenet Ramsey
I knew the minute you said 5 ft 6 and thin it was a woman 😒😁
I need a Dennis Raider (BTK) story PLEASE!!!!
Side note didn’t JonBenet Ramsey go missing in Colorado Springs also??
Six million subs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Slapping meats together 😂😂💀
Loving the butterfly clips 🦋💜
YayayayayayayaYAY!!! ❤️
It sounded like they were trying to set up Jennifer’s husband by placing his clothes at the crime scene. I think they both planned it and should of been given life equally
Always look forward to Monday’s. Makes working at an office job so much interesting with blasting Bailey
“What in the time travel is going on” 😂😂😂
here Bailey you dropped this 👑 !! so happy you're back!!!
Congrats on 6 Mill!!!
Not me rn in the bathroom at work watching this video. She is back!!
Welcome back queen! A nice surprise!!!
BAILEY! We’ve missed you so much ❤️
I literally CAN NOT tell you how happy I am you are back!!!!!! I have literally watched every single video..so I have had to resort to listening to some other YouTubers to get my true crime fix!! 🙌😂😂
YAY so happy you uploaded today!
6 million subscribers! Go Bailey! Much deserved 💕
250k population is small?! Well then I'm a country bumpkin in my little town of 17k...  😅 ooof
WE LOVE & MISS YOU 💓💓 glad you take breaks tho!
Slapping meats blahahahahhaha
Thank you, Bailey! For your sweet soul and positive outlook on even some of the most disturbing cases. You're amazing! ❤
“Why are you bringing me into this? I’ve got miracles to do” 😂
Ew, slapping meats lol
congratulations on 6mil beautiful 🥰 we missed you!
The Queen of YouTube is back!!! I missed you so much!!! Glad it’s Monday!!! Love you girly!!! 💜💜💜
They both deserve life with no parole!
Oh thank goodness, I was starting to go through withdrawal!
This is what I am missing badly🥰
“Slapping meats together” 😂
I've been waiting for a new video from you and I was not dissapointed! Great as always love you Bailey<3
Missed you!!! ♡
Slapping meats lol
i’ve been waiting 🥲
*Lovin the look & the 🦋 90's hair look!!!!* 😍💖😍
No, you're in an episode of "Supernatural".
Soooooo glad you are back. Your hair is so shiny……..girl crush 😍
Weird story.  😊 Love you! ❤
Hey I was born there! Lived there for 20 years! Cool way to start my day!
Lol thin man. First thing that came to mind.. creepy thin man 👀😂
Yay! Happy new year!! Hope your holidays went well. So glad you're back. Congrats on your 6 million followers!!!
Missed you Bailey!! Happy 2022 wishing you every success 🍾 💖
Wonder if this was Lt. Joe Kendas case???
The butterfly clips for me😍😍
The song lyrics are... "If you love me let me go..." Not "If you love me k*ll my wife..." 🤦🏾‍♀️
Hey bestie, you're joining me at work today :) welcome back
🤣🤣🤣 “…yeah no, let me think, no.” 🤣
I’ve never clicked so fast! Happy new year Bailey and everyone! ❤️
Slapping meats 🤣🤣🤣
She also sings a theme song.... don't ask- or complain, bahahaha
Yaay your back!!😁
Ok so I'm gonna keep with my request and that is Fred & Rosemary West PPPLLLLEEEEAAAASSSSSSSSSEEEEEEE and Thank You 😆😇😇👿💄 💚☘☘☘☘☘☘💚✌🤘
Yasss theme song, yassss! 👏👏👏
A guess for why the family doesn't want to believe Brian was involved: people can be in massive denial. Maybe they refused to believe he had anything to do with it because he's their last piece of someone/something close to her. Maybe it's something else. Unsure.
tiny nail without polish..... cuuuuteee 💓
I love your videos and how animated you are. I feel like my friend is explaining a story to me while doing her make up while I read a magazine on their bed.
A lot of us Californians moved to Colorado Springs at that time.  Most still here
I’ve missed you so much! Glad you are back!!!
*I'm just really excited that Bailey's back with the MMMM and (because I know this case)...that my name is about to be said by her repeatedly (and, not in the best way.)* 👀 *Love you, Bailey!!* ❤ 👑 💄
8am on Tuesday morning in Sydney. Best way to get ready for work in the morning, watching Baileys video ❤️
The police found their.. SMOKING GUN 💀
Colorado Springs is an hour from me. Go to Garden of the Gods and Manitou Springs! It’s gorgeous. 😁
IM SO GLAD U DIDNT MISS THIS WEEKS MONDAY <3333
Sheeeeeeees baaaaaaaaak!  Yes!
"Slapping meats together" BAILEY MY GIRL- 😭
Right English is not my first language and ,cocking the gun, sounds wellllll suspish to me 🤣
Welcome back
so it is always the husband huh
When I saw she posted a new video, I felt like a kid in the candy store!! I've been singing the theme song for weeks.... LOL
My day has been made!
Love the look ❤️❤️❤️
Yay 😁 sonasham sonasham!
Homicide Hunter..Detective Joe Kenda worked on this case. Amazing detective.
I love that you won’t lie to us!!!! It’s the cutest.
"Slapping Meats Together" 🤣🤣🤣 Oh the imagery !!!!
baileys videos are the only thing that get me through doing my homework 😭
i needed this after being edged by euphoria lol
I'm so glad you got that new chair....
Fort Carson Colorado woooooooooo the place dreams go to die
Hey I used to live there!! Love listening to these podcasts while getting the days tasks done!! 🥰😍
6 million!!! Bailey that is awesome! Oh and they should have kept Brian in prison longer, like forever...sad
Imma take this upload as a birthday gift. Thank you Bailey 💕💕
Ah another reason I cant stand religious people 🤦🏾‍♀️
"What in the time travel is going on here"  😂😂
It wasn't the husband but he was having an affair so it was the other woman? The husband of the affair?
"Slapping meats together"💀💀🤣🤣
Love the retro butterfly clips ♡ your hair was fabulous Bailey
How do I explain to my boss that I can’t work because Bailey uploaded? 😂😂😂
Bailey is so freaking adorable!
We also know that the spouse doesn’t have to be at the scene to be the corporate
You can buy guns at Walmart? Really? Usa Is in another level 🤦
Fry them both!!
Yes the 👑Queen👑 is here with more dark content for us
Living for the butterfly clips ugh
hooray! welcome back we've missed you! Mondays have been so boring without you! 🤸‍♀️🙏❤

J HIT 6 MILLION
They were definitely both manipulative beings who never should have met, and both should have been held equally accountable.
I’ve been waiting alllll day for this! Just in time to save my sanity! ❤️
The weapon was a weapon called the Peacemaker… what is this Clue? HA!
I am so happy you are back!!! Thank you!!!!!
Loving the butterfly clips Bailey 👌😍💜💕
I LOVE YOU BAILEY
I want your nose 🥺 love u ❤️
The revolver is the easiest to use for people who have little to no experience handling guns, that’s my best guess as to why the husband gave it to her.
Congrats on 6 million!!!!!!!!! ❤
Welcome back!!! Perfect day to. It’s my birthday!!! I been looking forward to you to post todays video!!! I hope you had a great break!!!
Hey Bailey we messed you 😭
Biiiiiiiiiissssshhhhhh, WHHHAAAAAAAT???????

I MISSED YOU BABE 😭
Bailey is the older sibling I never had. |(•◡•)|
Being diagnosed with lupus was the worst thing I have ever had to go through. Thank you for explaining Lupus because you be amazed how many don’t know or don’t get it.  I’ve even met people who claim it doesn’t exist 😬
WB Queen
Perfect timing miss B! Thanku.🥰
I’m so jealous of all the new comers who get to watch and binge all her previous videos, lucky sob’s. Love m m n m mondays!
💜💜💜😘👏🔥
You should cover Salvatore Perrone or the "son of sal" he was a a failed business owner in Brooklynn. He killed shopkeepers of Middle Eastern Descent  apparently while they worked.
You just saved my monday, now i can finish the day strong 😤😤😤
Colorado springs has a population of a million now, it is not a cute little town. It is super lit though!
Ah! I live in Colorado Springs!! This is exciting  🤣
I lived in a commune in 1976.  Loved living there
Or it's called the peace maker so the victim has time to make peace with their demons because they are gonna die...
Most people: I hate Mondays….  Me: Sha na sha sha na sha!!!
HAPPY 2022 BAILLEYYYY 🤍🤍🤍🤍
I was an army wife stationed at Fort Carson,Colorado Springs.
Yaaaaay!! You're back!! My Monday's will be complete now!!
Happy to see you back. Your hair is lovely, now let get to the story.
2022 and Bailey is still delivering divine energy 💕
“C**k”  * giggles along with Bailey*  Stop it 🤣🤣🤣 feeling wayyyy too immature right now 🤣🤣🤣 love u gurrrll ❤️ would sooo love to go on girly night out with Bailey imagine the fun … better still imagineeeeee the convos 😳
"What in the time travel...are we in  Clue? " hahaha😆😂🤭

This entire story was wild, Poor Diane. it’s great to have you back Bailey, it made my day 😆💯
Yay! So glad your back! ❤️ Got the family listening to you Mondays and Thursdays also ☺️👍

LOVE U BAILEY
I am VERRRY happy all my youtubers are taking a break!! Get yo vacation time in 😎
Welcome back!❤️😁 You asked if we have ideas for videos. I want to suggest Diane Downs who shot her children in her car, one died. It is a horrible story where she lies that a carjacker did it. There is a book about it by Ann Rule. It is so interesting.
"I got miracles to do" lol, put that on a Tshirt!! Also Congrats on 6 Million Subscribers!! Im glad I could be a part of it, you sixyy THANG!! Keep it up!

Do you have more confidence since your growth of popularity?
YAAYAYYY YOU’RE BACK! 🥰

Look at you lookin at 2000's with the butterfly clips! Takes me back!
Glad your back, I missed you so much
I love that quadruple click of the tongue. Gotta try it til you get it 😆  I’ve been to Colorado Springs, it’s super cute. The traffic lights made me so mad though, they’re like lower to the ground than I’m used to and it seems super dangerous.
Can do the case of Tamara Samsonova? Love your videos!
I'm so glad your back 😭😭😭 it's been rough. I ended up digging through all your GRWM videos 🤣🤣
The way she takes breaks : unexcepted and highly refreshing. DID YOU SEE HER HAIR ?  (welcome back !!!! 💚)
Olala la je t’attendais avec tellement d’impatience 😭🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
YAAAAAY
I'm so glad you're back missed you. I really hope you had a great Christmas and a amazing New Year 💛
People who *HAVEN'T* watched Bailey's vids: "I hate Mondays"  People who *HAVE* watched Bailey vids: "Not for us"
Well well well… look who it is 😌😂

Look how 1️⃣🙋‍♀️ human....(sweet🧁, normal, amazing, and beautiful 😍) can bring millions of people of different backgrounds💰♀️♂️⚧, skin tones🟤⚫⚪, cultures🇨🇬🇨🇰🇩🇿, etc...in one "place". I wonder if Bailey realized when she uploaded her first 📹, that she would bring humanity🤖 together for a few mins⏰ of freaking awesomeness 👌 👏 👍!!! Just a random thought!!! 😀 Happy 2022!
IM EARLYYYYY
Finally my Mondays have meaning again
I have truly been waiting and checking all day 😂
Staying up late for this ❤❤❤❤

WELCOME BACK BISH! I’m sure I can speak for all of us broads by proclaiming: ‘We missed you girl!’ 🤍🙏🏽✌🏽💥🥰
I don’t know if you’ve done this before but i really want like a “tell all bailey sarian” like how you got into doing this, what started your love for makeup, your motivation for this & dark history. More just about yourself and your passions and hobbies outside of yt! ❤️
Bailey: Brian is ruled out Me: Its the husband
Was about to DM and ask where is the 10 January video you promised... And its here... Am soooo happy... Monday is complete... *Mimicks theme song* you are the best
After feeling gross 😷 and testing positive for COVID this morning I needed this! Thanks for coming through like the bestie you are Bailey! 🤪😝   🔪 🔫😵  🕵️‍♀️?  💄 💋🗓
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for coming back to us. 😭 I've been checking my youtube the past Mondays out of habit despite you already telling us. 🤣 Hope you had a great holiday break, Bailey!
Yooooooo I cannot believe I’m this early 🤣😯 ❤️
Beiley.. no more breaks please !
Bailey! Happy New year 🎉
Soooooo glad you’re back Bailey 😍😍😍🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 I hope you had a wonderful time off. Happy New Year!!!! 🌟🎆🎊🎈
I'm at work, and counting the seconds to finish my shift so I can sit down with a cup of coffee and watch this! So excited to see you back Bailey, I hope you got all the rest you deserve and wish you all the best this new year 💗
“she was shot through the shoulder and she must’ve been in pain too” i gotta say i feel like it’s a little obvious she was in pain 💀💀 all love though no hate

What if they just had another outfit under it and then took off the top outfit & walked off looking different
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
How is there already 569 comments 😂 it's only been up for 8 minutes I feel late to the party
Baileyyyy! I missed you welcome back ❤️❤️ happy new year
Happy to have you back Bailey 🥺!
As somebody who was born and raised in Colorado Springs. Born in 1992 the Springs was really nice when I was younger but now that it's grown in  population from people transplanting from out of state and so on the crime rate has gotten really bad and it's just not a nice place to live anymore honestly
back with 6millions subs congrats
MY GIRLS BACK YESSSSSS
BAILZ IS BACK BITCHEZ ♥
