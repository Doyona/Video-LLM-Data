Blackswan paved the way for global groups in K-pop.
First kpop group who show treditional things in their mv support them 😊❤❤❤❤
Finally 10.1 million next target...96k more for 10.2 million
10 million viewers, are you ready for Bungee Jumping, babies?
🎉
10,1m🎉
데뷔곡이 진짜 힘 준거였구나... 진짜 레전드 퀄리티인데 예산이 많이 부족한지 홍보도 점점 줄어듦........
broo the song is  so energetic im  also trying to produce hits if you got some time to review my song i would love to hear your opinions
Siapa sangka lagu Korea vibes India seenak gini
3k more for 10.1 million
we hit 10M!!!!! Thanks, u guys!!!!! <3
Blackswan LITERALLY PROVES that u dont have to be Korean to be a k-pop idol/group!!
I'm indian i support blackswan
> A K-pop group without Korean members feels inconsistent with the concept. You might consider redefining it as a global group or adding at least two Korean members if you want it to still be considered K-pop.
Oo nice❤❤❤  im from odisha  i love you too so much
I hope for their suffering if not in this lifetime then another lifetime jaise gandhari ne shraap diya tha aaj mein shraap deti hun inke pura bansh ka binaas ho
E saala comeback naamde 😅😅 Do something DR
2025
The location is Odisha I am from Odisha 😊🎀☺️😮😮😮 it's really Odisha because I saw something  writing in a boat in Odia and also the between of two lions a girl standing that is a temple of Odisha the location name is khandagiri Odisha and so many temples I see in this video and so many more location😊😮😮

There songs are really good. Why not viral. This is the first time I've known about them
Hi Shreya Didi,  My name is Janvi, and I’m a girl from India who dreams of becoming a K-pop artist like you.  But in India, many girls like me face doubts and fear from family because of what they hear about the entertainment industry — fake auditions, unsafe situations, and people asking for things beyond talent.  That’s why our families get scared, even when we want to audition for real K-pop companies.  You are our hope — proof that a girl from India can achieve this dream through talent and hard work, without shortcuts.  I have a small request. Could you please share a short message for Indian girls — something to inspire us and help our parents understand that this dream can be safe and real?  Your words would mean so much. Thank you for being an inspiration.  With love, Janvi Kashyap

I usually don't follow k-pop girls band except mamamoo(they are the ultimate queens for me. No hate for other superlative female artists though) because I feel the focus is always not on the art of the girls but how much they can expose for public satisfaction. But Blackswan is definitely something extra good. Love these newest queens on the k-pop stage❤❤❤❤

This music should at least have 240-250 million views/listens. Is it possible for a revival? This also has the potential to be used as bgm in movies, and series. An underlying reminder of the philosophy, in a haunting, yet lovely tone.

This song gives AESPA vibes and is quite good. For some reason, it's not really coming through as a huge hit. I think they need a choreographer to teach them to dance harder as the dance moves seem meh.

Love you all<3
I’m going to clarify that I already knew them much more before and since before I liked their music, but from today I’m their fan❤❤

IM HAPPY TO WAIT AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO GET SOMETHING LIT 🔥 😸
Dr if they come with a full lenght album which constist of more than 8 or 10 songs then the wait is worth it ( but the songs also needs to be sound good also ) and if they come with a minialbum consist of only 2 or 3 song then your management is so bad and your only busy at wasting these girls potential and talent , and also  busy in canceling sold out tours
Lumina we are very close to 9m let's complete it till August
Dr music fans are leaving because you are taking forever for an announcement.Atleast try to communicate with us.We are tired of this.Stop wasting blackswans talent and do your job right.
We want official comeback announcement its already 3rd week of july🙄

If they didn't announce anything about CB before 20 July , i am sorry i am out of this fandom....DR is sooo stupid nd this girl's r continuously lying about their CB....I really love this girl's but i don't want to wait like this anymore....nd especially if Xin announce their CB before Blackswan i have nothing to say...shame on DR
BLACKSWAN 💖🦢✨ IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GROUPS IN KPOP 😻💕💖✨
🎊✨🎈🥳 Companies, Sponsor's, the Media should be lining up for Blackswans 💖🦢 Comeback✨ it's going to be Epic! 🔥  😻   🎉🎈✨🎊
please 10M before sriya birthday, it's 15 of september.
There's going to be a Global Dance Party when they Comeback✨ 😸
Sorry to say but if the CB announcement is not going to happen today or in between 20th July then I'm out of this fandom , it is so frustrating to wait like this for a CB and the excitement for the CB is slowly gone out of me bye 😒😔🙄 Dr you need to shut down that company seriously if you can't do your job propelry and the members constantly lying about CB and cancelling sold out  fan meating then you need to disband the group and shut your comapny . It is what it is , if you can't hear what fans want then bye and what are you doing in those 9 months 🤔 almost a year is passing since the previous release are you all sleeping or what 🤨 Plz for a last time announe the cb toaday or in betn 20th july
Have a wonderful tuesday dear Luminas. FANTASY is here to enjoy this beautiful song. 🎶KARMA x BIBORA 🎶 BLACKSWAN x SF9

Shouldn't this be called Bolly-Pop or India-Pop or I-Pop or something? No disrespect but there are no Korean members here. So how can they represent something they arn't even representing. I like the concept and it has personal representation. That is great but just needs to clarification.
Who is waiting for new song
I'm waiting for new songs

This is what a Global Kpop group is not Vcha or Katseye. They are only kpop because they dance and have beautiful choreography but they sing in Korean which is the element Vcha  and Katseye lack at the moment. Blackswan is Kpop because they make Kpop music and they are still they only korean kpop group with no Korean members but do sing kpop. Ready Luminas? Let get this to 9 million views before the Comeback!
Keep watching lumina..we are very close to 9M

Proof that legal immigration and an open mind to new idea's can lead to such good... These girls moved to Korea, learned Korean, trained their asses off and made history, Blackswan is proof that K-Pop is a global genre that transcends only East Asian's, this may just be a song but I think non East Asian K-Pop idols can really help shift an entire mindset

คนดูน้อยมากกกก ปีเดียวได้แค่8ล้านดับอนาถ เอาจิงๆนะ เพลงมันดีมาก แต่ทำไมโปรดักชั่นการทำMV ดูถูกดูCheap มาก มันก็แสดงให้เหนแล้วว่าคนเกาหลีดูถูกคนต่างชาติ จัดให้เปนพลเมืองชั้น2 ขนาดเค้าใช้ภาษาเกาหลีได้ชัดมากเหมือนคนเกิดเกาหลีก็ยังไม่ให้เกียรติเลย เพลงแบบนี้มันไม่เหมาะเอามาสร้างMV แบบนี้ มันต้องทำให้อลัง มีลูกเล่นเหมือนเพลงวงอื่นๆที่ทำกันสวยๆมีเอฟเฟค นี้เหมือนมาถ่ายกันเองอัดเล่นกันเอง เกาหลีสุดท้ายมันก็ไม่อยากให้คนต่างชาติเกิดกว่าคนของมัน ถึงจะมีโปรเจคดีเริ่ดขนาดก็เหอะ สงสารพวกนาง ที่จิงพวกนางเกิดได้แต่เกาหลีให้แสงแค่นี้ค่ะ

BLACKSWAME you are focus and target 50 M plezz
I think LUMINA should start EMAILING DRENT politely and respectfully about what’s going on, if I was their manager or person in charge the girls would be interacting with lumina or just posting some covers or something fun, I know they are tired but this is idol life interaction with fans is crucial! I hope nothing is wrong because it’s dry out here… I know they post here and there but it’s very dry compared to other groups, I love them so much I just want them to succeed! They need promotions/ engagement
9M LUMINA !

Good morning guys

You guys telling us in live that the comeback is in June then why their is no announcement till yet , and then what was the reason for cancelling a soldout Japan fan meeting, is the comeback is going to happen in 2025 or what ?

*Fatou:* "When I met the three new girls, to be completely honest with you, I was not really ready to reconnect again and build that deep bond and just be together in that creative space. I did it before, and I lost all of my members, and it was heartbreaking. I was heartbroken, and I was not ready to open my heart. I didn’t want to go through it again. But after a long conversation with the girls, I just, I guess without me knowing, my heart just opened again. My walls came down, and we kept talking for hours and hours, and I just noticed, “Wow, we might actually have a stronger connection this time than the last members.” We’re always together. It’s like we’re the same person in four different variations."

How to stream Black Swan MV 1. Select the MV you want to see, example KARMA MV 2. After watching MV KARMA watch CAT & MOUSE 3. After watching CAT & MOUSE watching KARMA again That's the correct way to stream so you don't get mistaken for a bot,  cuz if you repeat it by watching the same video the views will be deleted and you will be thought of as a bot~

Hi K-pop fans! Have you heard of both BLACKSWAN and X:IN? They’re both amazing groups with talented members, including the first Indian K-pop idols! If you’re a fan of one, why not check out the other? You might find that you enjoy their music and performances as well. Let’s show our support for these ground breaking groups and the diversity they bring to K-pop!       😸🤟

Morning lumina~ In indonesia 09.00
I am coming here after gabi and shriya Blackswan visit Korea tourism 2023- 2024 ad 😊😊
It’s been a Year since BLACKSWAN’s 💖🦢✨ Debut, and it’s Surprising that they haven’t Reached 1 Million Subscribers Yet. This K-pop Group’s International Talent is Truly Remarkable and Deserves more Recognition. Fatou’s 💜 Rapping Skills, Sriya’s ❤ Dance Moves, Nvee’s 💙 Vocal Prowess, and Gabi’s 💓 Visual Appeal are not something you come across Every Day in the K-pop Industry.  What sets BLACKSWAN 💖🦢✨ Apart is their International Composition - they are the First K-pop Girl Group with no Korean Members. Their Music Video for Karma ❤‍🔥 has already Amassed Over 8 Million Views✨ and their Performance at the 2024 Seoul Fashion Week 💖✨ Left a Lasting Impression.  The Talent and Uniqueness of BLACKSWAN 💖🦢✨ are Undeniable, and those who Fail to Recognize it are missing out on a Gem✨in the K-pop Scene. Their Loss will be Felt when BLACKSWAN 💖🦢✨ is no Longer Around. Let’s Appreciate and Support BLACKSWAN 💖🦢✨ While we Can, and Help them Reach the Heights they Deserve in the K-pop World.  😺
See ya tmrw! <3

*Fatou:* "One thing I always say and always think is that Black people can do anything, literally. We can do anything if we set our minds to it. It’s not only Black people, humans in general. So don’t listen to the external, bad, negative energies. Like, “No, you can’t do that because of your skin color. No, you can’t do that because of your this or that.” No. It's music. If music is your passion, if you feel like it’s your calling, go for it. Don’t ever be afraid. Go for it 100 percent, and you can do it! Come on, we Black! (Laughs) If I can do it, anyone can do it!"

“It is not easy to find locations that we covered through this MV in Korea. Dhauli Giri, Lingaraj Temple, streets, old houses, etc., all these heritage locations were so fascinating to all of us. So we really wanted to introduce all these to our fans and global audiences. Odisha deserves to be well known universally, in my opinion.” Director of DR Music,

I literally cannot hear people say “mimimimi this isn’t K-pop” , “where is the k in kpop” anymore. Seriously it’s getting on my nerves and people completely seem to miss the whole point of kpop and its definition. Our society builds up on diversity and the evolution of kpop shows perfectly that things cannot survive when they stay homogeneous just like they were founded. It is rather concerning how wide the range of racism is and that people start to be racist against their own ethnicity. There is a huge difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation and these girls just fulfilled their dream with no intend to hurt somebody. People we are living in the frickin 21st century so freshen up your mindsets and be more open for new things even if it’s something you’re not used to. I sometimes feel like I’m living in the 19th century. Some people kinda skipped the development of our society and go on exactly there where the prior generations stopped. The mindsets of most of the kpop Stans are so toxic and fetishized that I just want to puke in a corner. Why can’t we all work together as one unity? No of course we cannot because something like peaceful interaction mostly doesn’t exist between fandoms. That’s sounds weird but kpop is just a battleground for fandoms to let of their steam and shoot against each other. It’s just about being better and bigger. People dont care if their comments are hurtful, inappropriate or even racist. They just want to win regardless what stands in their way. They even feel good while spilling those words. As a multistan I feel disappointed in the people that present their lack of confidence and their inability to understand the concept of kpop in form of hate towards artists who don’t fulfill their unreachable expectations.

💖💖💖💖🛐🙇‍♀️🙇‍♂️🙏Dear God in heaven, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I acknowledge to You that I am a sinner, and I am sorry for my sins and the life that I have lived;  I need your forgiveness. I believe that your only begotten Son Jesus Christ shed His precious blood on the cross at Calvary and died for my sins, and I am now willing to turn from my sin. You said in the bible that if we confess the Lord our God and believe in our hearts that God raised Jesus from the dead, we will be saved. Right now I confess Jesus as my Lord. With my heart, I believe that God raised Jesus from the dead. This very moment I accept Jesus Christ as my own personal Savior and according to His Word, right now I am saved. Amen."

Sriya should be in the next Squid Games as Abdul Ali’s sister. Once a Scholar in India, she later joined the Indian Army and honed her skills to become a formidable Soldier. She comes to Korea on a mission to uncover the truth about her Brother, Abdul. When she crosses paths with Seong Gi-hun, she learns of Abdul’s tragic fate in the Deadly Games. Fuelled by a burning desire for Revenge, she steps into the perilous world of the Squid Games. Will she Survive? Or will she become another pawn in this ruthless Game of Survival?

Let's go lumina 7.8 M
Im not a lumina but this mv force to make me lumina so perfection keep it up blackswan you will get success like the top group🎉🎉🎉
KPOP = Korean Pop et je ne vois pas de vibes de ce genre, comme c'est étrange faudrait arrêter de trop mondialiser les auditions et les rendre accessible à tous on se retrouve avec des groupes de pop banale remplis de koreaboo qui collectionnent les photocards et leurs posters SKZ dans leurs chambres je répète mais KPOP = Korean Pop, donc avoir des idoles d'origines autre qu'asiatique, je ne trouve pas ça normal, ça devrait être que pour les asiats qui possèdent une langue maternelle asiatiques donc faudrait arrêter ce genre de choses gênantes. Merci, cordialement  signé un Haerin simp.

They are so unique. The song is good. If I have to give advice, it could be slightly sexier. Not a lot. Just a little bit more. The clothes could be more beautiful especially for the dance break.

Forever here again.  Have been stre@ming and listening to this marvellous MV 4 consecutive days.  I say let's push for 8M soon.  This is my 2nd best releases of 2023.  I observe agencies should start filming MVs outdoors or in another country.  It makes for a more eventful and creative process instead of sticking to safe indoor shoots.  Karma has the best outdoor MV in my frank and honest opinion period.  And the song is on a whole new level.

대표는 아이돌 관련 프로그램 같은곳에 출연좀 시키고 얼굴좀 알리면 더 인지도 높아질것 같은데 글구 암넷 해외 콘서트 라인업에 포함시켜서 해외 인지도 높이면 자연스레 국내 방송사에서도 반응 할건데 좀더 체계적인 홍보외 푸씽을 해줘라  최초의 외국인만으로 구성된 그룹의 메리트를 방송국에 제대로 활용하고 어필해라

The fact that Lumina don’t give up and keep steaming the girls song makes me wanna stay her forever I love you guys
Happy anniversary blackswan ❤❤
K-pop is becoming popular  around the world because it’s new, but it’s eventually going to grow old and people will move on. So, if you’re Korean, you better take advantage of the fact that your country and culture are popular now because once the show’s over, you’re going to wish that you had supported Blackswan. 😺
K-pop, currently a global sensation, may eventually see its novelty fade as trends shift. Therefore, if you’re from Korea, it would be wise to embrace and promote your country and culture while they’re in the global spotlight. Once this phase passes, you might find yourself wishing you had shown more support for innovative groups like Blackswan. 😺
800k subscr1b3rs is near! Waiting! ♡

아 진짜 노래 너무 좋다
솔직히 '중소엔터 + 전 멤버 외국인' 조합이라서 별 기대없이 봤는데, 이거 깜짝 놀랐습니다. 노래도 뮤비도 너무 좋네요. 이웃집 찰스 보면서 관심 생겨서 찾아봤는데, 진심으로 잘 되길 바랍니다.

790K SUBS! :D
This is not even a k-pop  How can a group with not even one single Korean be called a k-pop I think if they just debut a a girl group they will reach more far than being inside k-pop.... They make speak,sing or act like Korean or anything but I don't think they will reach far enough.... where member leaving the group may keep going on and on
Hãy lên 7.2M nào
Bài hát xứng đáng nhiều hơn nữa
If we can do it, let's get to 10M as soon as possible

Ofcurse if you have got lovers then there will be haters too but then its okay .                                       ~Zgirls Priyanka
Muito bom ❣️

15 Sep 2023 Happy birthday to Sriya
딴노래 듣다가 자동재생되서 봤는데 생각보다 괜찮은듯. 실험적인 중소돌 그 이상이 될지도?
Feliz aniversário sriya

너무 아름다워요..많은 활동 기대해요..응원해요^^
Lebih bagus dari blackpink....
this song is completely different from other kpop songs I love to hear that song Black Swan will be the next big girl group  ✨🙌🏻💜

They are so cute together, Fatou the fierce Mama, Nvee  the vigilant older sister, Gabi the quiet middle child who goes with the flow, and Sriya the playful but goal oriented baby, who you can't help but love. A family well on their way to bigger things.  ❤️ Trinidad 🇹🇹

The song is such a bop and also the choreo. I also love the cinematography. Idk but i felt that there's something missing if they want to portray desi, they should've add the female desi vocal which sounds like a beautiful swirly voice. 😅
Queens!!!❤
It's not really a k pop anymore, but sounds really good ❤
Wooow

Karma, I thought this song must be relate to samsaric suffering but not,that same unicorn dresses and rap by the way I don't understand the language but without understanding also there must be strong vibes to hold one soul heart and mind,if not verses then music must be good to feel relax and safe but in vain, and by the way the word karma is not fun, and funny got it, it is very much used in Buddist and Hinduism,  even we Buddist people have name Karma, and by the way have you people watched the MV of karma by Alan dawa dolma, watch it very nice video with Pure Nature, calm voice, Nice music, and Nice and very deep meaning, one phase is this Namo Namo gurubay, Namo Namo Buddhaya, Namo Namo Dharmaya, Namo Namo sankhaya

*Sriya:* "From the first time we met, our personalities matched well and communication between members was good. I also practiced hard. As a leader, Fatou helped us with many things we didn't know, and we followed her well. Although I was scolded a lot, my skills quickly improved, so I'm is grateful to her. At night, we all talked about music together, cried and laughed while expressing our own hardships."
O amor que as meninas tem pela música, por fazer parte da indústria do kpop inspira o fandom a querer que elas tenham um futuro promissor, isso é so o começo, sucesso ao BLACKSWAN 🖤🦢👑

Cat & mouse تستحق المزيد من المشاهدات انها ادماني هذه الفترة
اعتقد حقاً انني احببت cat & mouse اكثر من karma

Plz who ever is str3@ming don't forget to do everyday
Can yall believe this video is almost  at 7M? WOW. we've come so far!
Damn girls
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH LUMINA  i keep commenting on C&M to str3@m karma also but the vi3₩s  Omg does no one care about the bungee jumping video ir higher vi3ws or 10m goal?
Wow they're really good they might  Just create a new revolution ✨️
It's really important to watch different videos when you str34m (like 2 or 3 others) so since we're both doing that for Cat and Mouse and Karma we can switch between those 2 MV but also watch Tonight, Close to Me or any other video (doesnt have to be kpop)!
Intercala entre o mv de Karma e o mv de Cat&Mouse!!!!!
Almost at 7 M!
Cat & mouse stream
I think the speed of vi3₩s increasing
Can't get enough
Guys str3am 😺 and 🐭 mv
2:31 a sriya é incrível ❤

Vcs viram o cover da nvee de If aint got you (desculpa meu inglês, ainda tô no cofee and tea do Duolingo) a gata mostrando o pq dela ser main vocal
A diferença desse MV pra cat and mouse é gritante, mas o que não muda é qualidade das músicas pq são todas perfeitas
Surtando sobre a era cat and mouse aqui tmb, ficou incrível, dr se eu te critiquei e se eu mandei tu ir pro quinto dos infernos é pq de fato tu mereceu, mas o MV ficou IN - CRÍ - VEL
Essa música lembra muito das K/DA, que eu amo demais as músicas ❤😊

Gabi so gergous♡♡
Lumina we're doing great, i really feel we will make 7 million before the 6th.
I love the visuals. Beautiful girls, and I love how they incorporated some aspects of their culture. So, there is authenticity. I understand k-pop is become inclusive, and is progressing. But I wish  they stuck to just Korean/ English language in the song. But  adding Hindi, etc. made it really confusing.
Fatou voice 😍😍😍

Luminas have you seen Sriya's Dance moves on her own YouTube channel?... It's amazing and breakthrough. She's a versatile dancer. If she get a good mentor then I must say she will break the record in kpop. She can beat all the kpop idols in dancing.. Now I am excited to see her future works.
Love from India
Lumina speed up vi3s

Hwaiting the sky is the limit ❤❤
노래좋다
BTS의 하이브가 다국적 그룹을 구성하기 위한 오디션 생중계 프로그램을 시작합니다. 외국인으로만 구성된 케이팝 그룹의 본격적 시작이 되는 겁니다.  이미 형성된 블랙스완은 최초라는 타이틀을 갖게되고 관심을 더 받게 될 것입니다. 블랙스완에는 뛰어난 인재들이 이미 자리잡고 있습니다. 좋은 기회입니다.
응원할게요.
10M
Streaming :)
Opening Korea to diversity without throwing it in your face. Great
Really goosebumps wala song and views 🎉.. really u rocks my girls ❤️👌
46K COMS! :D
보컬 진짜 시원시원하다.
Just read an article that this group identify as a k-pop band despite none of them being Korean!. Clearly jumping on the recent k-pop craze in an attempt to shift albums. They have a video on YouTube with 2 million views despite it being over 2 years old. It's not working girls
실력 열정 노력 박수 계속 듣게 됨 가사도 좋고
cứ bình tĩnh các em ak bts mới đầu cũng không nổi mãi sau mới có hit
프로듀서 작사 작곡자가  누구인지 궁금하네요 멋진 곡이네요 승승장구하시길
this video is so beautiful i almost cried, i dont really stan blackswan but have respected them so much for what they do, and im so happy to keep checking them out, their music is so good and they seem so respectful and kind tbh
La La La La cat and mouse soon 😂🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
All these Blinks turning up and giving Karmas Credit to BP is a Joke. Lets go over there and have a Fan War with Blackpink. Its Ok since there coming over here and Promoting BP and it will be Good for Business and then hopefully get a DOPE! BLACKSWAN VS BLACKPINK MV 😸
Eyyyyyy ~
Keep going❤
🙌🙌🎉

BLACKSWAN QUEENS 😍😍😍😍😍
Please hard work and show ppl who are you... And you can do anything we all support you ❤
이 그룹이 케이팝이냐 아니냐라는 논쟁이 생기는 건 좋은 일입니다. 연예인에게 가장 나쁜 것은 무관심입니다. 개인적으로는 한국어로 한국에서 훈련을 받고 공연을 하고 있어서 케이팝 그룹이라고 생각합니다.
They were our traditonal dress I love it most
The voise the dance I love it 🎉 🎉
Omo omoooo goosebumps!!!!  This deserves a like subscribe and notify !!!
This is K-pop because they sing in Korean and they are under a Korean company
😘💗🔥
Why now there is a lot of brainless people who come for hating 5he girls suddenly and saying they are not a kpop group and others dumb things💀💀??? Like, is it the CNN NEWS interview who bring you here???
노래가 좋아서 구독했어요❤
J’aime bien ! Mais je comprends pas trop pourquoi elle change en coréen. Elles sont internationales autant chanter en anglais. Enfin, j’associe pas la Kpop à la langue coréenne plus au visuel, concept travaillé mais aussi à un style de musique particulière et la danse bien sur. Il y a aussi la formation pre-début qui est important. Pour moi ce n’est pas la langue l’important. Bref en tout cas ça rend super bien ! Y’a tous les codes qui me font penser à la kpop. 🫰
ชอบๆ
This is hella confusing 😅😅😅😅 they’re not Korean though
WHATTT there all so pretty 😭
Lets all be positive please.
Smh some toxic stan are here now.
Pop group, but not Kpop.
The chorus is fabulous
Cmon luminas we are close to 7M
Badd🤢🤢🤢🤢
Vem 7M ❤❤
Gente escutem cat and mouse e one more time tmb, sei que estamos focando em karma mas não vamos esquecer dessas tmb, as duas sao incríveis
Digo e repito lumina é o melhor fandom, 3 meses e as views e inscritos continuam crescendo ❤❤
Cara pq os comentários estão cheios de blinks inseguros não entendi kkkkkkkkkk
Okay, 1 2. Show me what you like ❤❤
Still Blackpink Wannabes. Copying soooo much, original name? Not. They are okay but can’t touch Blackpink.
Song is amazing but I don't like don't like MV❤
7M let's go
I see the light bru-ta-ta-ta-ta
Hello luminas ❤

Eyyow, this is bop
761k subscribers and 6.7M vs 🥳🥳🥳

BLACKSWAN 🖤🦢 SRIYAs 🐼 CREATIVE DEN INTERVIEW! ✨ 😻💕💖
6.7M Vs! :D
This song is so amazing 🤩🤩 Thanks you blackswan let us see the possibility of different development of kpop❤
Came here because of a BBC article. The song is good, MV is pretty, the group itself seems promising. Hope they get mainstream success!
Decent song, but where is the other girl? The one that actually looks good.. They used to be 5, right?
basically blackpink concept...no originality...won't last long.
Good djob
BLACKSWAN FİGHTİNG
Less than 300K until 7 million! :))
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Sreya is so beautiful 💫✨☺️
7 MILLION SOON LETS GO LUMINA DON'T STOP!!! 🥳💖
6.7 million complete 🥳
6.7M🎉🎉🎉
wtf
Let's get 7M
6.7M  vs🥳🥳🥳
Why they only show bad places of India
Would have been better if they just saying in englishm singing in Korean just makes them look cringe.
The fact that all Twitter is fighting to always say that Blackswan is not a kpop group after the interview on CNN hurts my heart... Especially for girls. They even brought XG back in that. Like.. it's a kpop group, we've already explained it at least millions of times
BBBFAMOUS
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m sorry but am I the only one that realised that they swapped out 4 members for new ones
Rumo 6.7 hoje 💪

WOW!! Straight GARBAGE!  It's no wonder Prince killed himself... from Kardashians and Jenners to Swiftys to Katy Perrys to this crap... and yet there's ALL THIS PRESS smearing the media about some "great new act"... the media is such a scumbag tool... these "dancers" are charlatans in the real art world.

PERFECT OMG
바라기는  BTS처럼 립싱크영상을 넘어 라이브하는 현장감 있는 영상제작이 블랙스완을 더 높이 날게하지않을까 합니다
THIS IS SO AMAZING

시상식 공연도 잘 보았습니다. 파투 의상에 약간 문제가 있었지만, 훌륭하게 잘 대처했습니다. 9월에는 해외공연들을 한다고 하니 잘 되었으면 좋겠습니다.😊
I’m sure this will be the new Blackpink if they disbanded ❤ BLACKSWAN
So proud of you sriya wow beautiful song blackswan forever'
Hello shriya I am a Indian fan I love your song karma if you read so reply Karo
Kore kültürünü bahsetmeleri.gerekirken.hint kültürü sesleri.iyi.olabilir.ama ben doğru.bulmuyorum uzakdoğu.hariç başka ülkelerden çıkmasını oranın müziği çekik.gözler felan.burada.zenci hintli.hep karışık kpop alakası yok böyle yaparsanız artık koop diye.bşrsey kalmayacak sesleri güzel olan.uzakdoğudam.seçin

This group is interesting. Many people tried to make a non-korean kpop group but failed. Black swan made it because they've been trained for enough time with korean system, and group concept that fits kpop tradition.
Don’t forget to vote for Fatou on 100 top KPOP rapppers her standing at 10th has fallen let’s keep her up at 10
아름다운 뮤직비디오....나는 인도인을 사랑해요❤

kpop에 인도 odissa 춤이 나오다니... @@ 이건 블랙핑크 리사의 라리사 태국의상보다 더 큰 임팩트인데요. 언젠가는 전세계 사람들이 알아주고 매일 방문하는 그날이 꼭 올 겁니다!!!!!

first time checking BLACKSWAN out! my jaw dropped because oh my gosh their vocals ARE amazing ESPECIALLY THE RAPPER??? I LOVE HER VOICE SO MUCH  their voices also complement together so well especially when the backup vocals are harmonizing together oh my goodness (and that high note before the final chorus was AMAZING)  this group deserves so much more recognition they are all so pretty and they have amazing vocals this group has gotten me into a chokehold (this song will be be stuck in my head for the next few days fr)

인도 분들께 감사합니다. 이렇게 아름답고 훌륭한 보석같은 인재를 한국에 데뷔시켜주셔서. 더 많은 응원으로 인도에서도 훌륭한 공연이 이루어지길 바랍니다. Thank you. India. So beautiful and gorgeous a artist like Sriya could play in Korea. More support 'd make more chances to do concerts in India.
스리야는 최고의 댄서입니다.  그녀는 인도전통 춤을 익혀서, 춤선이 시원하고 우아합니다. 한국에서 케이팝 훈련을 한 후에 그녀의 춤은 좀더 강해졌고, 풍부한 표정을 얻었습니다. 나는 그녀의 춤을 보는 것을 매우 좋아합니다. I think Sriya is the one of the best dancer in the world. her dancing skill is basically the traditional indian way. So gorgeous. and very cool.  after tainining kpop. She got more power and rich espressions.  I love her dancing.

Let's go luminas
LUMINA, WE NEED TO PROTECT GABI : There is a rumor on Twitter who is trying to circulate, apparently Gabi harassed a former classmate but it's false, there is no proof and also I know that we don't judge physically but Gabi would be unable to do that, they are some Brazilians who are toxic fans of Leia who are lying.. For anyone who knows kpop for a long time knows that this kind of rumor can tarnish the group's image and usually it's the person accused who gets fired so please we owe everything do so that it does not reach the ears of the kpop industry nor those of DR MUSIC otherwise Gabi risks leaving the group, for the moment, almost nobody cares about it but it will get worse..
Sriya Gabi fatou nvee

π℅[®©‌√	,
요 며칠 호기심에 케이팝 공부도 할겸 계속 보다보니 몇가지 생각은 듬. 그룹의 정체성이 잡힌듯. 비단 외국인들이 모두 구성원인 최초 케이팝.. 이런것보다 케미가 좋아보임.  파투 ㅡ 단단한 목소리, 스리야 ㅡ 매력적임. 앤비ㅡ보컬 좋음. 가비 ㅡ 유일한 백인.   뭣보다..다들 사이가 좋고 의지하고 성공에 대한 동기가 차 있는. 느낌. 그런데..  음악도 정체성이...확실히 더 잡힌다면.. 좋겠는데.. 기존 멤버들 노래는 성인돌과 베이비복스 시절 갬성이 있어서 지금 멤버들과는 좀 거리가 있어보임.  우여곡절끝에 탄생한 최초 전원 외국계 케이팝이니 부득이한 측면이 있으나 아쉬운 건 사실임. 노래가 멤버에 맞는 노래로 빨리 구성되었으면 함. 카르마가 재탄생 이런 느낌으로 해서 앤비가 보컬로 참여한 솔로4 노래 들어보면 발음의 문제지 앤비는 확실히 보컬 좋음. 좀 앤비 잘 살려서 음악적 정체성이 잡혔으면..  캣앤마우스 뮤비 잘 나왔으면 함 해외진출을 노린건 분명한데 스리야가 좀 통했으면 좋겠음. 잠재력 있는 캐릭터임. 막내 이미지에서 좀더 강한 이미지로 바꿔가는 건 어떨까 싶기도 함.   한국 걸그룹사이에서 한국식 예절  앞세우는건 당연한데 겸손한 이미지와 강한 이미지가 조화가 잘 되면 더 좋을 듯. 얘네들 잘 됐으면 좋겠다.. 이런 느낌보다.. 오 쎈데..  이런 게 더 잘 먹힐것 같음..

Ini keren woy! Jangan cepet bubar. Khawatir aja banyak yang nge-hate terutama dari native speakernya. Krna di grup ini gak ada member dari negara Korea tapi mengusung nama K-Pop. Di sana namanya ngebully itu kenceng bgt sih. Khawatir sama mental member BS nantinya. Semoga gak cepat karam. Terus berlayar ya, luv luv BlackSwan ❤

Dear fellow Lumina lets keep streaming Karma.
Guys maybe the CAT&MOUSE promotion will start tomorrow (13th August at the Tomato festival) so we have to make them at least 1M of views at this festival and promote them everywhere (tiktok, Twitter, etc.) So that at the beginning of the  performances for the shows, they have a chance to win
6.6M for Karma M/V 10M Views Bungee Jumping ! We keep fighting Lumina for our Blackswan.
🔥🔥🔥🔥 love this song to the core
7M!!
ชอบอ่ะ แปลกใหม่ดี เพลงก็เพราะดี
I just noticed that we had arrived at 6.4M 😭💗🎉🎉🎉
Don't forget Blackswan will perform in 2 days (13th August) at the Tomato festival (maybe this will be the beginning of the promotion of CAT&MOUSE)
A K-Thriller Drama for BLACKSWAN   Title: “The Rise of BLACKSWAN”  In the bustling city of Seoul, four young women from different backgrounds come together to form the K-pop girl group BLACKSWAN. Fatou, Sriya, Nvee, and Gabi all have one thing in common: their passion for music and their dream of becoming stars.  The pilot episode follows the girls as they navigate the cut-throat world of the Korean music industry. From gruelling practice sessions to dealing with the pressure of being in the public eye, the girls must learn to work together and support each other if they want to make it to the top.  As they prepare for their debut performance, tensions rise and conflicts emerge. Fatou clashes with their manager over creative differences. Sriya struggles with homesickness and misses her family back in India. Nvee must confront her insecurities about her singing abilities. And Gabi finds herself dealing with a dangerous situation when she discovers she is being stalked by an obsessive K-pop stan. The Fans suspect an EX Member of the Group. But is it?  But despite the challenges they face, the girls remain determined to succeed. With their debut performance approaching, they must come together and give it their all if they want to prove to the world that they have what it takes to be the next big thing in K-pop.  Will BLACKSWAN rise to the top or will they crumble under the Pressure?   BLACKSWAN FIGHTING!  What do you think of this K-Thriller Drama does this suit Blackswan?

Instead of using indian culture as just a visual "concept" this really feels instead like a collaboration between India and South Korea
Is nobody watching
Yt is freezing views 😢
I know we r a small fandom but we are doing great. Keep str3ming
My favourite group
Talent of the kpop. This award goes to Blackswan.
Very good quality. I saw a recommendation from BBC Thailand. Only listened to the beginning part but it was awesome.  I like them very much.  I fell in love at the first verse, and the music is easy to listen.
Ohhh wow 6.4m we r coming

블랙스완 파이팅:)
It's my Odisha ❤❤❤❤❤
Since I abstain and I do not speak there I am fed up.  this mf X:IN crazy fan idk why he is is weird like that 💀💀Because it's not there 1st time this hater comes out something like that , he has a tooth against gabi, Fatou and Sriya calling them kidnappers of children, cheaters, and many others, it's big nonsense,  this is not the first time we have received hateful comments from READYS but this one it annoys me frankly. Readys have this mentality of always thinking that We copy them when it's unliked, we don't care a little about them... Even on Twitter they are many to have been angry when we announced the news with ITZY, their favs will make a comeback soon but they only have the name of Blackswan in mouth, stop, it weighs on morale there! I went already 3 times under their comments to ask them nicely to come and take back their comrade but they always answer me strangely, you always declare war on us after, you are answered, you say that you are attacked, do not come to answer it by saying: It's a false Ready, NO. He looks like a fan of your band, he supports you every day, no excuses, come and take him.
the song and clip are super
45K COMMENTS! :D
7m
Guys what wrong whith this person @fashiongossip1382 apparently a "READY" X:in fan I know that we ignore jerks like them but this person's recent comment is next level...the shit this person have said in their recent comment under this video is so inhunam, whatever this person have said about sriya should not be ignored...this person have 100+  comments on this channel it shows how jealous he/she is of the opportunities blackswan is getting...Apparently they are also mad coz ITZY commented and liked one of fatou's reel (she made a tiktok on cake and posted it on insta) and fans are asking for a colab ♡... Also they think that blackswan is copying blackpink (I think it's the other Fandoms who are spreading these things so a fanwar can start between luminas and blinks ) do I or we ever said that x:in is COPYING itzy or any other group NOoo coz we never compares group's and idols everyone is trying their best....So the opportunities will come only  if you work hard (not smart😏)fame doesn't comes over night sweetie...please report this person's account if you find their comment   by THEY I mean this person only  (NOT all Ready's) . I know a lot of them are soo supportive and nice♡
So close to 500k likes 😊

There should be more multinational bands like Blackswan. They are fire 🔥, good job Korea ❤❤❤❤
Tonight they went gambling And the cops showed up Hyeme ran. Leia tries to tell them its fun in prison but Fatou escapes to India and finds Sriya and her friends Gabi and Nvee.  Fatou takes her new crew back to Korea. More continues
I don't like k pop. but I like the fact that it is not so Korean and that they are from other countries. It makes me want to follow the girl group they are so beautiful.
6.3 soon!!
Guys still 6.2 m 😢
Let’s support them !!
Vamos chegar a 7 milhões ❤🎉
Could have put more scenes of Gabi like that. (3:02) She was stunning ✨️

무방비로 들어왔는데  진짜 매운맛이네  놀랬어요
First the bad news... you cannot rely on your own righteousness,  as it is like dirty rags to God. Ever lied in your life? God said all liars will have their part in hell. Jesus said if you have ever looked upon a person to lust after them, you have already  committed adultery with them in your heart. If you have ever stolen something regardless of value you have sinned and the wages of sin is death.    Now the good news, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. If you confess with your mouth "Jesus is lord" and believe in your heart that God rose him from the dead you will be saved.  You must repent of your sins and trust in Jesus your saviour, who paid the price for your sins on the cross. It is a free gift of God so you cannot earn it. Remember what a man's own righteousness is to God. YOU must be  born again to enter the kingdom of heaven.    150,000 people die every day and none of them believe it was their last day on earth the day before. Get right with your maker while you're still alive
Love blackswan from South Africa ❤
Fatou  gabi  nvee sriya

Found the song yesterday, i can not stop listening, very nice job girls
Let’s keep streaming guys!
Still so obsessed with this song
fatou, yuqi, ryujin , jisoo and fatou will make me love my deep voice more and more each day ❤️
I can not get enough of this soong! its so freaking catchy like wth and the music video is just as good. I love the visuals so much and somehow I get the sense that these girls are all so sweet and down to earth. I think this is the first time I've ever felt this connected to a female celebrity in my life. and I'm a girl! usually they just don't feel relatable at all to me but something about them just makes me feel good. I love them. great performance. I hope to see so so much more.

This might be a small detail, but I absolutely love how in the scenes where the girls are at the Buddhist Peace Pagoda, they wear more conservative outfits and don't do any choreography there (aside from subtle posing). Very respectful 🙏
Black girls ??? YESSSSS  😍😍
Blackswan is kinda similar to Dolla (Malaysian girl group)  Fatou=Sabronzo (rapper) Gabi=Angel (visual) Sriya=Syasya (stage presence) NVee=Tabby (vocal)
Guysss 10m plzzz let's get the mv   to 10 m   as soon as possible

Vem Cat and mouse
Dando minhas opiniões nao solicitadas da 4temp de "eu nunca" ( sim, só assiti agora)  1- O ethan é tão irrelevante pra essa história meu deus  2- sempre tive raiva da Devi pq ela só toma decisão errada, além de não ser sincera com quem se preocupa com ela, mas olha só não é que ela evoluiu achei que não seria possível  3- Devi e ben >>>>> nunca duvidei, sempre fui team ben  4- Devi e Paxton ficam muito melhor como amigos   5- eleanor e o namorado que eu não sei o nome, melhor casal, quando eles tinham terminado tive vontade de parar a série, pq olha sem condições  6- por mais que a Devi tenha evoluido, a mãe dela me impressionou bastante, quem diria que a mãe da primeira temp que não dava um mísero apoio iria se tornar na mãe incrível da quarta temp
3:02 muito linda véi 😮😮

A nvee é tão linda, como que ela pode ser tão doida kkkkk
Mais uma noite dando views pras gatas (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡
Não quero ser portadora de má notícia, mas a fatou falou que essa formação seria a última (nvee gabi sriya e fatou), ela falou isso pq os luminas estavam suspeitando que entraria uma membro coreana, mas os haters estao usando esse trecho dizendo que ela falou da leia(ela nem citou a leia) a leia respondeu dizendo que era pra anunciar e tals, o que eu quero dizer é que muito provavelmente a fatou vai sofrer hate de novo, então dessa vez vamos proteger nossa lider ❤❤

6.2M is very near!
The v13ws are ver slow! Force Lumina! Don't stop!
Blackswan has surpassed 55M overall vi3ws on their channel..  Let's get them to 100M with cat and mouse.  Lumina can do it
Lumina now that the lineup is stable it's time to call our other fandom friends to stan Blackswan
Let's get 6.2M
Dr music saw their popularity with karma and said hold up, maybe we're doing right

I used to think this group was a gimmick... but after this, i eat my words. This right here the direction this group will go to show that they can go toe-to-toe, head-to-head with the greats of K-pop entertainment.
The dance break is fire 🔥
Gabi
Nvee
Fatou
Sriya
Brr ta ta ta
❤️❤️❤️
Love it! ❤
Blackswan ❤❤❤
YouTube deleting views??
what's wrong with yt.... why are they deleting views
Why it seems that everyone is jealous of Blackswan.. Ha ha.. Is it because of their talent?? :) Blackswan Forever
king inang yan ang accm
Quebra tudo Gabi
It is really K-girl group and K-POP.

Well, it is already known that fatou confirmed that the 4 are the definitive line-up, and I like it very much ❤️ but Leia is still in the agency or soon for future projects she will work under the DR MUSIC label? ¿Or is he definitely no longer part of the agency?😱😱😱
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE REACHED 10M before the girls have their next comeback with CAT AND MOUSE ❤️ And so happy that this is already the definitive lineup, they have a lot of harmony between the 4 BLACKSWAN4MEMBERSPERFECT👌👌👌😍
GABIIIIII NOSSA BRASILEIRAAAA 🇧🇷 REPRESENTOU MUITO BEM ❤
블랙스완 넘 멋있어요 더더욱 흥하고 잘되면 좋겠네요 한국 문화도 이해하려 노력하고 잘 융화해주니 고맙네요❤
Don't get me wrong but in my opinion this lineup is PERFECT as it is FATOU 💚 NVEE 💙 GABY ❤️ SRIYA 😍 DR MUSIC can give new girls a chance by making them debut in new groups.✨👌  WAITING FOR A NEW COMEBACK (CAT AND MOUSE ❤️) Congratulations to our BLACKSWAN QUEENS👑, more great things are coming for our girls, let's keep supporting them and streaming 👍🙏
Fatou confirmed no new members to be added this is the final lineup.
galera o saturday (grupo de kpop) lançou o comeback delas, ajudem as meninas a não desbandarem♡ (o conceito delas é bem diferente do blackswan, mas elas tb merecem atenção)
Goal: 10 months = 15 million
BREAKING NEWS :  I researched and found that Emojis and Comments have nothing to do with Views. Views get deleted when Bots Make the Views and use Emojis. Think about it why would Youtube make Emojis and Comments delete Views, then nobody would use them and it would affect the Artists and the Ad Makers. Do you Agree? 😸
Fatou 💜 Sriya ❤️ Nvee 💙 Gabi 💖
LOVE U
Wait this music video was legit shot under 10km from my house where tf was I? But great video and song 🎉🎉
How are you today ?? ☺️ For those who are interested, I create a petition for kick out Sriya 💗💗💗💗💨

Amazing visuals, i especially like the transitions during fatou's rap
their vibes , voices kinda remind me of K/DA 😄
Fatou arrasa mano q mulher
Ooooh weeee that Karma. Blackswan will continue as a permanent 4 member group.
No Chinese =  Success
BLACKSWAN will be going on a tour to Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore❤ Please wait for September / October
BLACKSWAN will from now on be a 4 member group (Fatou, NVee, Sriya, and Gabi). No one is leaving or adding. It is confirmed. BLACKSWAN is currently preparing their comeback Lumina (news articles have said that).
Wow, it's unbelivable!! How great girls they are!!

Sriya, Gabi, Nvee, Fatou ❤
Pity x:in  idols for having  toxic Ready fandom that will Bring group name  down.lumina please don’t follow like them .We respect all K-pop groups .peace 😢.Thank for contributing the views.Anyway.we won the vote fair and square .Stop hating on BlackSwan 😊
Luminas what happened why slow ? Keep $treming❤

🤡🤡
Let's go for 6.2M !
i love this!!
845k to 7M
Lumina,What do you think of DR MUSIC adding 1 or 2 members to the group? Mainly Koreans, there are rumors that say that for their comeback in October there will be new girls...Personnally it's NO I'm tired of theses changements, for for once we have an original group in the kpop industry, they will ruin everything, everyone knows Blackswan as the group with foreigners members only, like they have had all these interviews and others.. For once the success come for this underrated group, It seem like their CEO doesn't want they become popular... 💀 For me it's OT4, Koreans will favorise the Koreans members and these 4 currents girls can go far..
45k to 6.2 Go lumina
Love you blackswan
Love it ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

Fatou, Sriya, Nvee, Gabi are best 😊
6.2 M lets gooooooo
If we fans will spread negativity then it will be a negative impact upon the new fans who just joined the fandom 🙏🙏
NOVA won on TCHEKKING 😍😍😍😍She won  against SOYEON from G-IDLE!! She is more popular than some known idols !! 😘😘😘
One thing i noticed that there is  some fake readies who are spamming here negativity and at the same time some fake Luminas... are doing the same... Sadly😢  I saw it in both the mv's new coment sections ( keeping the fire and karama as well)  We don't need a fan war.. Everybody has their own charm and talents.. So don't need the unnecessary comparison 🙏..  Here m requesting to all my Luminas and readies.. Go and support your favourites but don't fight because of some fake Ready and Fake Lumina
Our victory had to be damn salty for READYS to come and show off the little brain they have 😂😂
Stan blackswan stan talent ❤
Let’s keep working hard on this mv, our goal is 7m then each mil after until the big goal 10mil
To all the people whj are arguing here . Guys instead for spreading hate go and stream you favs songs . It will help them grow . And by  talking about being the best or a flop  . You guys are just insulting your idols hard work and the talent they have . All of them alre talented thats why they got the chance to debute .  I hope you guys will understand this things and stop hating .
To luminas, don't waste your time watching the keeping the fire mv. Our support is not welcome apparently

노래 좋네요. 응원합니다~! 음악 스타일이 KDA랑 비슷한 느낌이네요.
Blackswan so proud❤❤😢
다들 너무 잘하고 멋있어요!!
I don't know much about Black Swan at all cause i literally just discovered them... But my question is ... Why would anyone hate on this? It's really good, doesn't sound much different from other famous Kpop groups ( in a good way) and the girls dance and sing super well! Why are there so many hate comments??? I don't understand...
Is it me or toxic readys are VERY stupid ? Like they spend time watching and commenting here hence forgetting their favs mv. They let their fav flop then come complaining here. They're indeed very dumb
Wow 6M
August is coming closer and closer
Daily reminder to luminas to prepare themselves for cat and mouse
Luminas don't forget to watch the performance video, let's bring it high
Did luminas went to sleep ?? Anyway stream karma
Just 15k likes to reach 500k likes
Lumina we have a new hater in our comment section,   @fashiongossip1382 they're giving comments to blackswan in the name of hate but they don't understand that YouTube doesn't know the difference and will push a video that has many comments, so ignorant of them.   Please reply with a "thanks for commenting" they're so stupid that they always answer hence increasing our comments and views even more.
0:45 she trying so hard to sing like Roa 🤮 I'm sure it's her fault if our Roa left the group, she bullied her ! She was jealous!
Blackswan begged READYS for vote 😂 now you shout everywhere you won but it's just cheating
Amoooooooo ❤
5$ and a dream 🤡🤡 guys you lost your time go stream Keeping the fire, it's better🤩
Blackswan have given money to MNET Plus to win!!
가창력도 너무 좋고 한국어를 너무 잘해서 놀랬습니다. 타국에서 가수로 생활한다는 것이 쉬운 일이 아닐텐데 멋지네요. 흥하세요!
Blackswan didn't deserve the win... Really be fr, Kiss of life and X:IN have more talent than those koreaboo 😭
I hate you blackswan! You have hired  this  p0rn star Sriya, now she steals the show from Aria!!!🤮
Keeping the fire!! 🔥
1:35  and 1:39 ... WHAT A GREAT TRANSITION

Lumina if you see a toxic ready in the comments, please reply and thank them for the views and the comments. They're so dumb they don't realize they're instead helping the girls instead of their favs.

Congrats 6.1m
There are so many readys hating here but plz don't go there to hate  I am speaking the TRUTH. they are very toxic  But we have to keep calm and don't hate others  And prove that we are not toxic like them
When I see the comments on keeping the fire of x:in  There is only one person who is a blackPINK stan trying to hate And xin fans saying they got so much hate and say we begged for votes and so much things And here ready are hating saying that so many of us hate on their fav WTF!!
괜춘~~~!!!
These Swans are awesome.
응원합니다🎉🎉🎉🎉 노래도 너무 중독성있고 비주얼도 좋고  잘될것같아요!!~~

So close to 6.1 let's go...
It's so close to 6.1M!
The word "Karma" is Indian origin...mainly in Hindu scriptures...But it is used vastly in Japan... that's why Japan is so disciplined
블랙스완 축하합니다 !!!!
우연히 영상으로 무대을 봤었는데 노래도 좋고 외국인 멤버들인데 한국어 발음도 좋고 무대에서의 기억이 오래 남아 또 찾아왔네요! 많이 알아줬으면 좋겠어요ㅎㅎ♡
진짜 비디오 잘만들었다. 인도 다음엔 브라질, 벨기에 기타 등등 맴버들 출신 국가들 바탕으로 뮤직비디오 제작하면 좋겠네요.
I can’t wait for cat and mouse so excited I pray they have the best comeback ever again 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽✨✨
7M before September 🙌🏽
Let’s get to 6.5 by the end of August
a quantidade de comentários coreanos e views subindo mesmo depois de 2 meses de lançamento do MV só prova o quanto as queens estão crescendo 😭 parabéns meninas!
Es la canción de BLACKSWAN que mejor le ha ido hasta el momento

YESS WELL DONE LUMINAS WE HIT 6M let’s go for 7.. hopefully we can reach 10m as BLACKSWAN promised a special bungee jumping episode for us when they hit it !!
응원합니다
다음번에는 k팝 느낌으로 가려고 안하는게 낳을듯. 커버하는 느낌이 강함. 접근방법을 다르게 해보는게 낳을듯
hello I love this song and I wanted to thank you because I am French and that with my friend we dream of making a k-pop group we almost gave up on our dream several times but when we discovered your group whose members do not are not necessarily Korean we have regained hope so thank you very much to you I love you
1 million ✅ 2 million ✅🎉 3 million ✅🎉 4 million ✅🎉 5 million ✅🎉 6 million ✅🎉 7 million ✅🎉 8 million ✅🎉 9 million 🔒 10 million🔒

황홀한 할때 와~~~~~~~ 최고네요^^
멋져요. 응원합니다! :)
다들 멋찌다❤
저 혼자만의 과대망상일지도 모르지만요. K-POP이 하나의 장르가 되어버리면, 블랙스완은 선구자가 되는 겁니다. K-POP 그룹은 한국인이 있어야 한다는 벽을 깨는 최초의 rule-breaker가 되는 거죠. 꿈과 열정 하나만 믿고 낯선 땅에 와서 노력하는 모습을 응원합니다.
헐... 장난 아니네 🏖👍👍👏👏👏
Yes we did it
언어는 영혼을 지배한다. 한국어에는 한국 느낌이 있고 한국만의 정신이 있다. 이건 다른 언어도 마찬가지. 언어가 유창하지 않으면 성공은 요원한 일. 파투 혼자 살아남을 듯 하다.

외국인으로만 이루어진 그룹이 있다고 찾아보앗네요.몽환적이고 신비로운 인도의 분위기가 새롭게 느껴집니다.멤버들의 노력이 저평가된거같네요.

it would be better to get full information . Btw I'm not comparing X:IN and Blackswan.they are best in their own way but now ready isn't spreading hate then why luminas are still spreading hate about X:IN if you have ever read readys comments then your opinion would be changed because we Readys support blackswan it just a mindset that you luminas set in your mind that we hate sriya because of her skin colour after all she is Indian and first k pop idol . We don't hate anyone our fandom isn't toxic if we really spreading hate then you got to see a lot of hate comments here did you see? No cuz we don't do same shit which luminas are doing . If you don't believe you can check the newest comments of keeping the fire where luminas are spamming and promoting blackswan . If you luminas want to support blackswan then support but why are you spamming there ? 😮‍💨 Anyways after all it's not fair and if you still think we Readys hate sriya then why there always reels about blackswan on X:IN fanpage we Readys support both .......I just write one simple comment but in keeping the fire MV you'll got to see a lot of comments of luminas and then you are saying it's our fault 😮‍💨.....if your fandom isn't toxic then what it is actually blackswan is good but have toxic fandom . It would be better if lumina know the real meaning of FANDOM it doesn't mean to support someone by defaming someone .......
This song is awesome!  This group is perfect The members is gorgeous!

947k let's go
랩등 곡에 힙합요소가 너무 많이 신선도가 떨어짐.  아티스트 문제가 아니라 곡 문제임. 케이팝의 최대의 적은 힙합 요소의 과다 채용임. 손쉬운 길에 독이 있는 것임.
6 mil tomorrow
와 랩톤 미쳤네
❤❤❤😂 굿 노래도 좋고 멤버도 너무조아.. 흥하자 엄지척 ㅎㅎ

블랙스완은 그 재능을 바탕으로 한국에서 인정받기 위해 노력하고 있습니다. 다른 문화, 언어, 생활 방식에 적응하는 것은 쉽지 않습니다. 그들이 받을 자격이 있기 때문에 우리는 진정으로 그들을 지원해야 합니다.

정말 앞으로 더 잘 되기를 바라는 걸그룹입니다. 앞으로도 좋은 곡 받아서 걸그룹으로 성공하길 바랍니다.
KEEP VOTING ON MNET + LUMINA
슬슬  홍보  들어가는 구나. 여기 저기서 블랙스완  이야기가 나오니.. 근데  회사는  이 그룹의 뿌리를 어디에 둬야 할 지  고민  많이 해야 할거야.  외국인  k pop그룹이라는 이미지만 소비해서  이 친구들 국적 국가에서만 반짝  인기 끌고 말건지...  힘들지만  한국에  뿌리를 내릴건지....  한국인은 매력만  잘  어필하면  피부색 따위는  신경쓰지 않는다..   실력도 안되는것들이 인종차별이네  뭐네   주접 떨며  변명하는 거지...  랩하는  흑인 친구는  너무 의젓해 보임.  오마이걸 미미  참고하면 좋을듯..   좀  부드럽고  맹한  이미지를  만들면 좋을듯.. 반전 매력..
아니 나 팬 될 거 같아
falta pouquinho para 6 M vamos conseguir luminas ,continuem!❤
래퍼 독보적이다
충격이네요❤ 빌도드로 가즈아!!!
그간 낯선 땅에서 땀흘려 노력한만큼 꼭 성공하길 응원합니다.

BBC 인터뷰 보고 신기해서 보러왔는데, 큰 충격 받고 갑니다. K-POP이 이렇게 다양하게 아름다울 수 있는지 몰랐네요. 알려줘서 고맙습니다.  그리고 파투, 랩 시작할 때 음색이 너무 좋아서 감탄이 절로 나왔어요. 정말 멋있어요. 😎

Vote for blackswan on mnet cool vocals They are really cool 😎
👍
노래 너무 좋다 더 유명해져서 그룹이 확 떴음 좋겠다…
I'm gonna be honest, this song sounds incredibly generic to me. I wish the producers actually included microtones and raag (indian scales) in the music to not only fit with the theme of paying homage to Sriya's background but also making the song sound a lot more interesting.

화장이너무짙고 춤이 어색 춤도너무보던것들 연출도 자꾸줌인으로쳐다보는게 너무단순하고 지루함 옷코디..ㅠ 아쉽네요 외인구단같은거라 노래춤실력기본이래도 선입견있어서 어색하고불편하지만 얼마나할까싶은데 고퀄이 느껴져야할텐데 그게없어요

Eu vou subir  (Eu vou subir)  Bem alto ir (Bem alto ir) Assim eu sou, sei aonde vou

Eu acordo, com a luz da manhã, a duquesa pergunta quando eu vou me consertar, eu sei que ela pensa que tenho sorte mas princesas querem se divertir, nós princesas queremos só...
Aqui estou, sendo quem eu sou, dou tudo de mim, sei o que quero, lá vou eu com muita emoção brilho na escuridão
Tenho essa sensação, tudo esta certo então...
Antigamente, eu só tocava, por diversão, ninguem ligava, agora enfim, olham pra mim, tudo mudou, num sonho estou...

진짜 애들이 부른거 맞나? 눈 지긋이 감고 들었는데 대한민국 걸그룹보다 한국말이 더 정확하네 물론 외국인이라서 발음에 신경썼겠지만  얼마나 노력했겠어 외국인이 한국 아이돌보다 더 잘 구사할려면  외국인이 한국어로 말하는것도 아니고 노래인데 간혹 명절날 특집으로 외국인들이 장기자랑으로 k pop 부르는 거하고 차원이 다른데 그들역시 많은 연습을 하고 준비하고 나왔을텐데 이들은 정말 직업적으로 할려니 수십배 아니 수백 수천배로 불렀겠지 부디 앞으로는 꽃길만 가길
노래도 영상도 너무 좋아요..... 모든 역경을 이겨내고 4명의 소녀들이 꿈꾸었던 소망이 이루어지길 바래요~
5Time Watching Karma  in One day
파투 보자마자 한눈에반했음 ㅜㅜ 너무너무 취향이다🥺🥺💖💖
BBC Korea보고 음악들으러 왔는데, 원석이네요.  다들 performance도 좋고, 노래도 좋고. 소속사에서 마케팅에 더 노력해야 될것같아요. 역주행시켜야죠.  Fatou 랩 음색이 정말 멋집니다. first single도 듣고 왔는데, 정말 이런 그룹을 오늘에서야 알게됐네요.  잘되길 기도합니다 5세대 K Pop 그룹
케이팝이 한국인 손을 떠나려는 지금이야말로 가장 한국스러운 무언가가 된 셈
블랙스완은 뜹니다. 지금은 미약하지만! 이미 영국 BBC 부터 다수의 해외 유수의 방송사에서 취재해갔어요!   아직은 단순히 호기심이라 해도 실력 더 키우고 인내를 가지고 있으면 반드시 성공합니다
wij zijn Belgen net als fatou
leuke video mijne kleindochter is fan van jullie we zijn van Belgie (Belguim) in vlaanderen wij spreken nederlands (dutch)
Okay I can say that I’ll never regret that I started to stan Blackswan
한국인 없는 1세대 kpop 걸그룹으로 성공해서 좋은 멘토가 되었으면 좋겠네요.
I see many Korean people in comment box I am so happy for blackswan ❤️

진정한 글로벌 1세대 걸그룹으로서 한 번에 대박나면 좋겠지만 아직은 조금 느리더라도 지치지 말고 꾸준히 활동해 주세요! 응원하겠습니다, 타지땅에서 낯선 언어로 노래 부르는게 보통일이 아닐텐데 대단합니다!!!
Gabi eu te amo<3
색다르고  신선하다   노래도  참 잘하네
Just reminding  Have you voted for blackswan on mnet cool vocals? And  Have you watched the dance performance? If not plz do We have to do at least 1m
일단 노래가 너무 잘빠졌다 ㅠㅠ
전원 외국인, 특히나 비슷한 문화권의 동아시아 출신도 아닌 외국인들로 구성된 걸그룹은 처음 보는 거 같은데 준비도 잘 해서 데뷔한 거 같음 발음이나 퍼포먼스도 좋고 앞으로 자주 볼 수 있으면 좋겠음
헉 래퍼분 너무 좋음..;;;
Keep fighting luminas❤

This is my favourite comeback this year so far. Fatou needs a raise, she improved a lot as an idol and is very powerful in this MV ❤
Vote for themmmm
1:35 -  1:44  the instrumental is similar to that of Savage - Aespa, only with a faster rhythm.
Galera, entendam: O blackswan pode ser TUDO, menos um grupo de kpop. O blackswan nao é um grupo de kpop, apenas querem ter esse título, mas a verdade é que nao são. Na minha opinião, o grupo tinha tudo pra dar certo e ser um bom grupo, porém a empresa está falhando miseravelmente, tanto com a formação do grupo quanto com as próprias meninas. Nós temos aí o exemplo de diversas meninas que já saíram do grupo por conta de problemas, rumores e até desânimos. Todo ser humano pode ficar desanimado e acabar desistindo de algo, mas agora, isso acontecer diversassss vezesss... O que eu quero dizer também é que: a formação pode estar boa pra empresa e pro público delas, porém pro público alvo pode ser um gigantesco problema. Acompanhei as meninas desde o debut, e desde lá elas vem tendo problemas sérios.
They are so UNDERRATED
❤ mejoraron muchisimo, la calidad es buena y la canción tambien, me encanta❤
Omggg i love it!!! Let's go girlsss, you ate 😌

Let's go guys
Been watching this every after odd eye circle — air force one  supporting the girls 😉 karma and close to me is my favorite
Ok 4k more for 5.7m
i'm so happy everytime i listen to this <3 i reallyy hope they'll comeback quickly, no hiatus
please make more good videos like this, never lower your level. So our Blackswan grows.
I support and love Black Swan. They belong to K-pop in Korea. In order for them to grow further and be praised, they must be united with the Korea they belong to. If the fandom rejects Korea and praises only them, they may gain huge popularity now, but there may be no second or third multinational K-pop members. K-pop is coming to an era where the world is united with Korea. Thank you ^^
개인적으로 좀더 힙합으로 가면 좋겠습니다
딘짜 잘될거 같다, 특히 랩하는 누님. 언프리티나 쇼미나오면 그냥 다 바를듯!
Saya lockey suka lagu karma ini🤭
I love how far they have come ❤ I been a fan from the start and I love to see how diversity is coming in the kpop industry
래퍼 음색 진짜 미쳤다. 비주얼 노래 다 좋은데.

KPOP does not mean a group with all korean members. they are foreign but their korean accent is really optimal

*NVee:* "I had a lot of work to do. But, vocally I had to do a lot of vocal exercises to be able to sing along with the dance, and it’s not perfect right now. I know that I can do better and that’s what I am striving for. But other than that, I just tried to work on my facial expression and how I want to portray “Karma” on stage."
This isn't kpop
🥰🥰
Let's try reaching 5.7 today guys
That's Great!

Thank you for your support! ❤
와. 멋지다. 멤버들 한명한명이 파트도 그렇고 잘 어울리고 조화롭네.
NVee: I had to work a lot on my physical and core strength. Something I am still working towards to this day. So, I did a lot of exercises physically and vocally because Karma specifically is hard on me physically. So, I had to up my endurance in order to not be so tired by the end of the 1st chorus. Ha ha. I had a lot of work to do. But, vocally I had to do a lot of vocal exercises to be able to sing along with the dance, and it’s not perfect right now. I know that I can do better and that’s what I am striving for. But other than that, I just tried to work on my facial expression and how I want to portray “Karma” on stage.
blackswan is so underrated it needs more attention, their songs are fantastic

*Fatou:* "We, first of all, focused a lot more on our vocals as we had more vocal lessons than usual. “Karma” and “Cat & Mouse” are vocally more challenging than our previous songs. As for our dance practice, let’s say for “Close to Me” we had three days of the week dance lessons, but for “That Karma” album we had six days of the week dance lessons. So, we really put in a lot of work into our performances. The recording sessions were longer. We put in a lot more effort in vocal layering, harmonization, and adlibs to give the songs our unique color."
Incredible performance 👍👍👍

*Sriya:* "It was an amazing experience for me, because it’s the first time a kpop mv was filmed in India with an Indian concept. So, it’s a very proud moment for me that Indian culture is being shown on the global platform. When we first performed in Odisha Hockey World Cup, we were blown away by the audiences’ love and cheers. Always thankful and grateful to have Lumina on our side."

Tôi là ARMY, tôi xin lỗi vì biết các bạn qua tìm kiếm bài hát Blackswan. Nhưng các bạn thật sự tài năng, đầu tư vào mv quá đẹp, cả hát và rap nữa. Mong là các bạn sẽ được nhiều người biết đến hơn.
라이브 무대 보고 찾아왔어요! 노래 좋고 중독성 있는데 늦게 듣게 돼서 아쉽네요 ㅠ
very awesome, its real

The rapper’s voice is deeper than I expected, I really like her voice! they are all beautiful and talented!
Very boring

Will they also promote cat and mouse? that song is also amazing
I've been seeing the dance trend of this song all over but had no clue it was out and it came out months ago dang. Anyways it's so good and everyone looks so fabulous big slay

인도 소녀와 인도 문화는 kpop에서 sriya를 환영합니다. 우리는 항상 당신을 아름답게 프로듀싱한 노래로 지원합니다.
와우 너무 좋아 인도와 한국 문화를 함께 볼 수 있어 인도가 너무 좋아 보여요 다른 케이팝 그룹도 이제 인도를 방문해야 할 것 같아요 인도도 흥미로워요
Let’s get 6 million lumina
keren banget lagu dan koreo nya. acting yang bagus, dan juga cantik-cantik. MV yang banyak nunjukkin kebudayaan India yang udah dikenal diseluruh dunia
멋지다!! 🎉
Everyone did amazing 😊
Day 26 of watching karma mv until 100 mil
They should have English full albums and hits English market directly
Karma is now blackswans must v!evved mv
So good to see some proper cultural appreciation in kpop when it comes to south asian culture which is often grossly misrepresented or mocked
just found out about this group, the cultural representation is beautiful😭
Não vou cansar dessa música nunca ❤❤❤
About 500 views to beat tonight's views and 53k for 5.6 mil
Can’t wait till cat and mouse promotion
Guys we need about 3-4K views to go over Tonight's views
YESSS
Omg se me quedo la canción no la dejo de tararear
Is this their original channel for girls?
I first read as: BLACKPINK. And then I saw a different name, and eventually became interested)
The song is great but why are they always dressing them up so bad! And the choreo could be so much better... When you see the solo dance you suddenly figure there is much more potential there!
59k to 5.6 mil
Luminas we have to do 5.6m today
와... 이그룹 너무 좋아요...... 진짜 성공했으면 좋겠어요 ㅠㅠㅠ 중독되서 계속 듣는중
Please add English subs! It doesn’t make sense for the most international K-pop group to be the least accessible to an international audience
This is actually one of the best girl group releases of the year and I’ve had a ROUGH time with Blackswan releases in the past
This is a new wind of the world!!! Best performance ❤
Come on LUMINAS 5.6M 🤟🤟 let's go 😈😈😈😈😈😈
Cat and mouse is really good song please promote cat and mouse
I hope they start their bside cat and mouse promotions soon cuz that song need to be recognized!!!♡

They are so good
We all know the power these girls hold, they have a great group chemistry, each member has a different charm and they complement each other. Now we all know that’s it’s totally capable to exist a multinacional kpop group, they just did it! But at the end of the day you only listen and stan a group if the music is good (not saying this is bad) but DR music need to get this girls a bangerrr song, not a generic, and do not miss the timing!!!

와.. 외국인들만 구성된 그룹인데도 어느 한국 아이돌 저리가라할 정도네.. 발음도 완벽하고, 라이브 방송보니 가창력도 뛰어나던데 인기 많아졌으면 좋겠네요.
5.5+ Million iktr
❤this is beautiful 🤭🔥theyre fire expecially Sriya and Fatue
Almost 5.6 🎉❤
케이팝을 이용만하는 외국인 그룹이 아니라 진짜 케이팝 가수가 되고 싶어하는 리스펙이 보여서 보기좋음 암튼 뮤비도 노래도 멋있음 다른 나라에서 반응 오는것도 좋겠지만 한국에서도 잘됬으면 좋겠당

i quit listening kpop so many years after 2ne1 disband. Now, i think i will support these girls
제목이 카르마라서 인도에 가서 찍은것도 좋고 댄스브레이크 마지막에 인도스러운 손동작 들어간것도 개연성있고  인도인멤버가 너무 상큼함 ㅋㅋ(양갈래 찰떡인듯) 떡상기원해요!
중국애들 없는것만으로도 성공해야한다
YESSSS

Hi luminas

중국인 맴버만 없다면 난 다 환영이다 ~~화이팅
지금 멤버들이 좋네요 전체적인 음색도 그렇구
I'm back again to listen to this masterpiece, brr tatata
맴버중에 중국인이 없다는게 정말 다행이네
It's only been a month since we got this COMEBACK but idk why i am so EXCITED for their next comeback!!
그냥 👍👍👍
a group that shows actual strength and drive to be known in korea. they take the time to learn the language and immerse themselves in the culture unlike other international groups who sing fully in english and simply just promote in korea. blackswan, I’m rooting for you guys. I really enjoy this song and cat & mouse.
They are coming back soon with a blast.. Wait for it.
Also listen to cat & mouse, it's a good song
그 우리나라가사 1도없는 일본그룹이 k-pop 씹어먹는다고 뮤뱅나오는것보다 이그룹이 더 진정성있고 잘됬으면 좋겠다ㅠ홧팅👍

I don't get it, India loves Kpop right now and this bop of a song obviously has Indian elements. Why are the views so low?
New goal, 5.4M I think in 3 days we can reach it :)
Cant wait for the 3M and 5M video challenge.
Next 5.4m
1집때 팀 컨셉은 좋은데 노래가 아쉬워서 사라지려나 했는데 이렇게 다시 더 멋지게 나와줘서 고마워요 ㅎㅎㅎ 블랙스완의 컨셉을 잘 보여주길 바라요

This song is not nice
*NVee:* "I had always heard about India through my friends who are from there. So, it was a very heartwarming experience to see it all with my own eyes. Indian culture is very welcoming, bright, and colorful. I loved to see the artwork on the walls around the city. Other than that, India was the place I had my first debut stage, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. Because that is where everything started for me."
❤❤❤
Love you ❤ all members
노래도 괜찮고, 뮤직비디오도 잘 찍었고. 이제 좀 더 뜨는 일만 남았겠죠? ^^ 응원합니다. 글로벌 그룹이 되기를...

Stay positive and positive things will come to you, same with blackswan. If we only think about had things or how things can get bad, then only bad things will happen. It's also not good for the heart
Lumina don't hyperfixate on the views, it might make you sad just stream without minding how fast the views go and please don't compare our streaming speed to anyone, this is the biggest mistake you can make
I'm still watching the shorts, I'll never stop

I actually liked it a lot, I wish they would implement running scenes ATTENTION! not from a drone, they have to use a rail camera that follows them and alternate that with a cameraman that runs after them and NOT WITH A GO PRO PLEASE. I think I'll search more about the new members, they look very talented, but I was really shook about Syria I think her name was, her visuals don't contrast AT ALL with the camera, she doesn't look ackward at all and of course our goddess Fatou <3 is my cherry blossom, outfit 1000%. About the other two, the girl with blonde hair was a little still during the visual scenes, so it would be appreciable if you gave her an artistic move when she has so many close shots or body shots a kind of black mamba move that is not in the choreo... or she could have raised her head during the move where Fatou is in the centre and she's bending down and you could have transitioned in her eye, stopped the music for 6 seconds, done a much more artistic work with the kids and the smoke addding very calculated moves where everyone was moving their hands and touching each other faces, probably added some storyline to the concept and then restart the music.  The outfit of the fourth girl with dark hair have to be toned down and more thoughtful of her overall body, just move harmonic, during the performances too, I liked the one with colorful clothes, but the one in all black was not as pleasing: they have a not very comfortable move where she is in the centre and if you give her short skirts it will appear too risky or uncomfortable for her, so please whether you let them do the movement all to the right and make them turn their head to the cameraor you let them perform with longer skirts or trousers, because as I said the long baggy trousers performance was very cute, beautiful and they looked comfortable. I'm waiting for a storyline, they NEED ONE, the team has to really stop for a second and think well. In all you left me VERY VERY POSITIVE AND OPTIMISTIC, GOOD JOB!
Hit please 100 million love you india 🇮🇳
제가 노래를 진짜 많이 듣는데 노래 선정 잘하면 충분히 빌보드 들어갈 수 있는 그룹 같습니다.  다음 노래 선정 한번 잘 해보세요. 어떤 분이 대성할 수 있을거 같다고 했는데 제 느낌도 그렇네요.

Un latino comentando, debo decir este grupo llegara lejos .... Es algo unico fresco y versatil me encanto
진짜 노래 잘뽑혔다... 뒤늦게 알게됐는데 계속 듣는중 이렇게 다양한 문화보여주는것도 좋아요
노래 넘좋다
Still 5.1 m we're very slow 😢
Клип норм но без индии и так далее было бы красивее
Love it! Everything and everyone looks and sounds great! A korean song with an indian setting - I think this may be the first mv with something like that? Anyway, I'm liking the combination of both themes 👏🏼
Acabei de gravar um episódio EXTRAORDINÁRIO da Terceira Temporada da Saga Minecraft.  Juro, foi espetacular… Há mto tempo eu não ficava tão entusiasmado. Tá muito bommmmm!!!!  Falta pouco…
Dr music please give us English subtitles for this song please
I love this song so much!!
If it was really about India, then why doesn’t the music video have scam call centers and people defecating in the streets?
5,2 MILLION 🎉🎉🎉

Everything about them is pure. Their talent, skills, visuals, views(str@ms) everything is organic. I heard their company is really bad at managing them but they still got the second chance to do better, these girls have a lot of potential. Love from India.

elas são incríveis, adorei essa formação, mas não vou me apegar. dr music né galera
As transições do mv ficaram incríveis, pra quem tinha um orçamento de um pastel e um suco fizeram muito bem ❤️‍🩹
5 million 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😊
As meninas se esforçaram tanto nesse comeback, momentos assim me fazem perceber que ser lumina, é saber que vai ter dias de luta e dias de gloria kkkkk❤ amo vcs
KARMA KARMA KAMAR
I just realized there’s no lyrics cc
KEEP STREAMING!!!
I like this song.  Performance, beat,  melody and exotic ......

10M leggo
Please don’t change the lineup! It’s perfect this way
뮤비랑 멤버들 너무 예뻐요 ㅠ😍😍
Mới biết nhóm và thực sự yêu thích nhóm ❤
Goal 10 mil before August
I can’t get enough
자막 추가하시는게 더 좋을거같아요!
Wow. Astonishing amazing fabulous ❤❤❤ this cover was so beautiful so good. ♥️😌 Lots of love from India 🎉💕
신선한 도전이 너무 기대되네요. 전체 멤버 외국인이어도 위화감 없는 카리스마 있는 분위기, 뮤직 스타일도 리드미컬하고 너무 좋은데 멤버들의 한국어 실력이 굉장히 뛰어나 보이네요.
what's your favorite color?
who's your bias?
WHO'S GONNA SUPPORT BLACKSWAN FOREVER?
They slayed!!
writing this comment so i can comeback to it in a few years! lumina since debut🤘🏼
Visuals 🔥 Location 🔥 Expression 🔥 Costumes 🔥 Song, vocal, rap every thing is likee fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
렙하는 언니 누구야 반하겠다 진짜...❤
노래 너무 조코~~~~~❤
OMG SOOO MUCH LOVE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉
Keep streaming
Fatou’s rap is a masterpiece
Luminas share the mv and watch the shorts, this will help us. You can see many people saying how they came from the shorts so don't stop, they have to reach 1M at least
Luminas you need to understand that you never stop streaming a kpop music video, especially if the song is good.   There are so many awards were groups should have at least 10M to participate.  Also, you never know when the video is going to go viral and blow up  I can see many lumina asking when are we stoping? You never streaming a music video.  There are other fandoms who are smaller than ours but still stream better. It's not time to relent.   Again streaming constantly makes the company understand that there is demand, that there's a fandom and that the fandom isn't dying.  Stanninng a kpop group is way different than stanninng a western group.
The fact that there is 450k likes is INSANE
Fighting ❤
Consistency
this is so good
I love it ❤
Amazing........༎ຶ⁠‿⁠༎ຶ
Wow!!It's nice and cool...
지금 멤버조합 넘 좋은데 더이상 멤버구성 변경 없으면 좋겠다ㅜㅜㅜ
Fatou is the most beautiful girl in k-pop industry. She’s prettier than Yoona from SNSD tbh
let's go luminaries now that we show half of our power towards 10mil
Always rooting for you <3

이번 곡 너무 세련되게 잘 뽑히고 멤버들 실력도 부족함 없어서 홍보 열심히 하면 진짜 뜰 거 같은데... 넘 아쉬운 그룹임 실력과 노래에 비해서 너무 안 떴음... 지금 쇼츠로 좀 뜨고 음방도 많이 나왔지만 앞으로 더 떴으면 좋겠다 항상 응원할게요 다음 노래도 얼른 들려주세요!! 🥹🥹

비쥬얼 훌이 케이팝 아이돌 아닌거같은데 ㅋㅋ
이 그룹 유명해?
한국 아이돌은 피부 까만거 안받아주는거같아ㅋㅋㅋ
헐 케이팝그룹이야? 블랙아이돌이 있을줄은 몰랐네요 하하하
So many gg comes and disbands but none of any girls from disband to atill active have such a angelic voice, mind blowing talent of all the categories, thank god this gg debuted to save gg popularity or i was shocked how all the ggs was losing popularity for having bad vocals and bad talent of other categories

뮤비 퀄 실화? 잡스런 효과 없이 인도의 진면모만 담아낸 고퀄 인터내셔날 뮤비!
लव यू ब्लैक स्वान मेरी सारी शुभकामनाएं आपके साथ है😊😊 मेरे साथ और कौन-कौन ब्लैकस्वान को सपोर्ट करना चाहते हैं
노래를 가장 좋아한 사람??
Cool song. But I liked the clip. Although we have an interesting charm
쇼츠 보고 왔는데 진짜 머리가 띵 하네요 노래도 너무 잘 뽑혔고 뮤비 색감이랑 컨셉도 너무 예쁘고, 몇년 전부터 활동하던 그룹인데 몰랐다는 게 씁쓸하긴 하지만 기분이 넘무 좋아요 모래사장 속에서 보석 원석 하나 찾은 느낌. 2~3년치 뮤비 몰아보러 갑니당 여자 아이돌 그룹 덕질 해본 적이 없는데 이번에 해보는 것도 너무 좋을 것 같아요
다 넘후 예쁘고 음색자체가 진짜 넘사여.... ㅠㅠ 살짝kda같은 노래 음청 잘 어울릴듯
Get this to at least 10 Mill, absolutely stunning
뮤비 왜케 고퀄이야…? 비트도 미침… 더떳으면…
They all look so pretty and beautiful in India cloths😊😚😍🤩
Forever a Lumina

나는 이 그룹을 너무 사랑해, 문화적 다양성, 왜 많은 사람들이 심각하게 문제가 있는지 모르겠습니다. kpop은 Fatou, Nvee, Gabi, Sriya와 함께 또 다른 차례를 맞이합니다 💓
이런그룹이 조음..요즘 기어나오는 일본에서 데뷔하고 한국에도 발걸치려고하는 일본인그룹들보다

Kiểu nghe nhạc có màu sắc ấn độ vẫn cứ gọi là... Ngày xưa các cụ làm nhạc bên phương tây mê mẩn những giai điệu từ đất nước đầy tâm linh này. Trong một cuốn sách cổ xưa về văn hóa, khi nền thịnh vượng dịch chuyển từ Đông sang Tây.  Các đất nước phương Tây xâm lược các vùng đất xung quanh, chiến tranh, nô lệ, tình dục và xâm lược. Thế giới chuyển đổi mạnh mẽ khi cách mạng công nghiệp lên cao. Nền văn hóa phương tây bị xuống cấp một cách trầm trọng, họ quên những giá trị tâm linh thánh thần, thứ con người hàng ngàn năm tôn sùng. Ấn độ một đất nước xa xôi với nền văn hóa đầy bí ẩn, những câu hỏi về tâm linh đến ngày nay chưa được giải đáp, được coi là cuội nguồn của cõi vĩnh hằng, giá trị thực tại về con người ẩn giấu sức mạnh, trí tuệ, quyền năng. Nơi con người thui rèn phẩm chất và giá trị. Những âm hưởng thần thánh và giá trị bền vững của đất nước trở thành nỗi mê mẩn của bao chàng trai châu Âu và Mỹ làm về nghệ thuật  những năm 50 đến những năm 90. Những show âm nhạc nổi tiếng tái hiện cùng những kịch bản hùng vĩ về giá trị tâm linh mà đất nước US-UK vẽ ra về Ấn độ bao trùm thế giới với màu sắc ma thuật. Luôn là những thứ âm thanh, nốt nhạc đầy chiều sâu dù bạn có pha trộn nó vào bất cứ thể loại âm nhạc nào. Nét chấm phá ấn độ luôn cho cảm giác hũng vĩ, khám phá như đang đứng trước những tòa tháp nơi con người chạm tay vào niết bàn. Tôi một người đã từng đắm chìm trong màu sắc này. Tôi cũng hi vọng con người trở nên nhân văn và hiểu biết, và cũng rất mong con người có tri thức thật nhiều để cảm thấy Giá trị thực sự của con người rất rộng lớn. Thế nhưng... ko phải ai cũng có cảm nhận này...bởi để có nó bạn đọc nhiều, nghe nhiều, và sống đủ qua những kiếp nạn và tưởng trừng con tim bạn vỡ vụn và tan nát. Đó là lúc bạn hồi sinh và nhận ra bản ngã của mình.
seni seviyorum Blackswan💜💚💙💖

Wow i can see many kprean comments i knew it after waterbomb they will have more koreans
Ok I'm back for strə@ming but why the vi3ws are slow ok till the end of this month let's get 5million + !!
와..다 각자의 매력이 담겨있네요.오늘부로 입덕♡
We have to take this to 10 million they said they will bungee jump on 10 million views
Why the vi£₩s are getting slow? Where are lumina's who make it 1 and 2 million in just few days are they tired of $tr€@ming ?
This is actually a good song 🫀
i love them for making Kpop more inclusive. From what I understand Sriya is from this part of India. How amazing would that be if Blackswan could represent each of their culture in albums and also make one about their love for Korean culture. I fell in love with korea a long time ago now and when I was there it felt like home. I know that is exactly how a lot of kpop lovers feel, specialy when you speak Korean. I would love a song that could embody that ^^
गिप्पी गिप्पी
I don’t normally like Kpop but I can’t get this out of my head, I love the combination of both countries to make An amazing song and MV
Beautiful choreography, beautiful shots. You girls are marvelous ❤️ sending love from Brazil 🇧🇷

I clicked on it after seeing 4.8
I love how they are showing odisha culture ,place and people  Lots of love ❤ to blackswan
Fotou's rap ❤️‍🔥
I am here againnnn
유튜브 쇼츠 보고 여기까지 왔습니다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 파투라는 분은 막 영입됐을 때 화제가 돼서 잘 알고 있었는데 나머지 멤버들도 너무 매력적이라 노래 꾸준히 찾아 들을 것 같아요!!! 근데 스리야라는 분이랑 쌍둥이처럼 닮아 보이는 느낌이 없지 않아 있어서 다음 활동 때는 구분할 수 있는 스타일링을 더 많이 해 주셨으면 합니다!!
오호 노래가 좋네요
진짜 다이쁘고 노래도 중독성있음 한국인 멤버가 없어서 새다름 각자만의 매력이 진짜미침 노래도잘하고 진짜오늘 처음봤는데  너무이쁜것 같음 🥰🥰

wㅇw
Essa música delas consegue ser melhor que todas as que haviam lançado antes. Estou feliz por ter conhecido elas. Ótimo grupo.
Anybody knows how much streams blackswan is getting on Spotify? For each song cat&mouse and Karma?
숏츠보고 찾아왔는데 ㄷㄷㄷ 진짜 발음 너무 좋고 다들 개성이 너무 뚜렷해서 더 좋은 것 같아요!! 예전에 음방에서 한번 본 적 있었을때도 신선한 충격이었는데 이젠 걍 너무 좋네요!! 이번에 노래도 너무 좋아요!!
모르겠고 걍 개쩐다 ㄷㄷㄷ 랩퍼분이랑 고음파트랑 킬링파트 부분 부르는분이랑 걍 전부 쩌는듯 중독성 쩔어 ㄷㄷㄷ 개잘한다
파투 간지나는거 봐라
5 million before July. We can do this!!!! LUMINAAAAAAAA!!!
파투 목소리 너무 좋다 솔로곡도 내줬으면❤

클났다! 이제 비쥬얼에서도 밀리게 생겼다! 쟤네는 협동심,끈기,인내력,집중력,자제력,배려심, 겸손 이런게 없어서 한국식아이돌 트레이닝을 못버틸줄 알았는데 정말 큰일이다!
We're so close to 5 million views,  lumina! Thanks for working so hard to get Blackswan this far.
Lets give our support to their hardwork  New arising group❤ This MV 🔥🔥
This whole video was a visual treat: the background locations, the singers, the extras, the imagery, everything was just beautiful. I didn't think I'd love a song as much as 'Close to Me' but this one is also a hit.
갠적으로 돌고돌아~ 하는 파트 너무 좋음 중독성도 있고 노래 제목인 카르마랑 진짜 잘 어울리는 가사라고 생각함
I love this song ❤❤❤
Группой не интересуюсь, но песня крутая🙂
The more you listen to this song,the more you get hooked🫶
Why not english?
0:51 여기 랩하는 엉니 미쳤어..
Lalalala
The song is really good ,the mv could be better but it could be understable given that the budget is not that high. Anyhow the song is going to my list
뭐야 이거.. 존나 신선하잖아?
Pure talent and visual ❤
Ê hay nha. Nhạc cuốn ❤❤❤
새로운 패러다임! 응원합니다
오..😮

진짜 너무 카리스마있고 좋다... 내가 지금까지 들어봤던 kpop이랑은 전혀 다른느낌 한국에서 대뷔해주셔서 감사해요..❤
Horror house for 5 million
Yessss 🖤❤🖤
Obsessed❤
4.8M goooo
4.7M Vs :D
한국멤버가 없으니 훨씬 조화롭다. 한국은 기본적으로 아시아계와 섞여야 어울림.. 저 리더친구도 외로워 보였는데.. 훨씬 편안해 보이고 좋다.
is it me or the whole mv changed
I love the song karma ❤❤and thank you for giving this type of song and sriya well done you keep our  culture in  song and I am from odisha  Keonjhar  also lot of love from here ❤❤
I am an army please do not take BTS place or I can do it

The music, your dance, and the colours it all feels like I’m in heaven. No doubt they gonna be something great🥰

نحن حرفيا نقترب من ٥مليون مشاهده دعونا نكثف المشاهدات مع لايك واشتراك بالقناه  الهدف الرئيسي لدينا هذا هو ان نحصل على ٨مليون We literally have to get close to 5 million viewers. Let's intensify the views with likes on the channel. Our main goal is to get 8 million viewers.
Once again don't forget to watch the shorts after or before the mv. It helps the views to grow altogether. We're so close to 1M on two of them

Poker Face
뭔가..감동적이고 뭉클하네요.. 케팝이..외국인들만 구성되어 한국 아이돌처럼 음악을 한다는게..정말..대한민국 만세...독립운동하신 애국자님들께서 이 날이 오실걸 아셨을까요..너무 가슴이 벅차군요.. 다시 한번 대한민국을 지켜주신 애국자님들께..하나님께..감사드립니다(_ _)
All the members are talented and perfect love this group. The best example of every skin colour is beautiful. <3

5M haunted house with the dark light camera!
새롭닷!!
Imma tell you guys but this group is no regular group, THEY ARE A HUGE MASTERPIECE IN MAKING! I can already tell how diverse they are from the music and concept, anything suits them but this concept touched my heart as a fellow Indian.❤lots of love ❣️
I feel like at the beginning mv is change?
This without ads?
good job guus yu are fantastic😄
진심 너무 좋다❤
천만 가서 번지 점프 가자~~~~~~~
We are close to 4.7M luminas we can do it :)
Alright guys I've been thinking HARD about the 5 million challenge and, even though the haunted house is cool, I think it should be PAINTBALL!! They could have a match against their staff since they also had ALOT to do with their success! Why? Because of HOLI,  the Indian festival of colors!!! At the end they could bring out the dust powder and just celebrate! The girls arent weak nor scaredy cats and this would show that!
5 million!!🎉
LEST GO LUMINA!!!
Gabi, we love you!
😍
im so happy to see this.. LETS GO GIRLSSSS

No matter how many times I listen to this song, I do not get tired of listening to it.
Ame a sriya y fatou❤❤❤❤❤
Good decision to change the other members with Fatou still in the group. Her voice matches the new members voices and there chemistry is better compared to the first set of girls. With Blackswan's new visuals and stronger sound, they could definitely make it big internationally. Hoping their management will go the extra mile for the group's success.
❤❤❤
Waoo
I'll suggest that put those type of chorus, we as an indian,western or any pppl in world can sing or humm your lyrics so, that ppl will catch in easier way. And as a viewers will search that particular chorus on yt or etc sources..
I love karma

I come everyday to listen this masterpiece ❤
The fact that they shoot MV in India with Indian staff and shown local Indian people and locations while singing in Korean with artists from across the globe is the beginning of real globalisation of k-pop.  These girls are doing what many dared not to do. Hats off to them and their company for taking this first step. They are becoming popular because of their talents. They didn't criticised nor did they boasted to get attention !! I support them with all my heart.

Blackswan is unique in whole kpop industry.. Love u so much❤
ฉันเป็นคนไทยที่เพิ่งเห็นวงนี้ คือmvดี ทุกคนในวงมีความสามารถ เสียงดี ฉันชอบคนแร็ป มาก เท่มากจริง ๆ โดยเฉพาะในสัง k pop ที่ไม่มีคนเกาหลีเลย หวังว่าจะผ่านด่านแม่เกาหลีทั้งหลาย ใด ๆ คือ ความสวยไม่ใช่แค่ขาวสวย หมวย หน้าเกาหลีอย่างเดียว ผิวสีก็มีเสน่ห์ในแบบของเขเช่นกัน และ วงนี้ก็ทำได้ดีมาก หวังว่าจะดังเปรี้ยงป้าง ในเร็ววัน ในtiktokก็เริ่มเป็นไวรัลแล้ว สาธุ ๆ ปักเมนวงนี้แล้วฉัน ❤❤🎉🎉
I LOVEEE how vibrant this mv is 😍 indian culture is so beautiful n im glad blackswan managed to embody it well for this cb
Love from odisha.

I'm not even a stan of this group but this is cultural appreciation at its finest and other kpop groups especially certain ggs should be taking a page outta Black Swan's book when it comes to doing anything related to India and indian culture.
5 million!!!!🎉
Ok LET'S get it 4.5 Soon!! Before 1 MONTH OF KARMA!!
คนไทยมามุงเร็ว
Waw😮
I wish the girls could actually start taking part in the song production (Fatou did this with her mixtape:pwapf, as well as her features with Leanon) to avoid delays and also because when you have writers and producers within the company label it costs less time than when you are outsourcing them. But I shall be patient and hope that dr music doesn't pull a stupid stunt of some sort. These girls are enough and I am a proud Lumina.  ❤❤❤❤
Patiently waiting for more content after promotions.
I really want to see GABI sing high notes. It's gonna be great.
YASSSSSSS

Good song, beautiful mv, girls are very hot and so talented  I wish tham to be popular.
WoW! 이거뭐야.. 정말 잘 만들었네.. 블랙스완 응원합니다.
뮤비 배경이 오디샤 지역이네요. 제 아는 지인이 오디샤 가본 적이 있는데, 정말로 아름답더라고 하네요.😊 저도 한번 오디샤 가보고 싶네요...🇮🇳❤
These 4 girls are amazing! I like how their beauty is so diverse and i can tell who is who just by watching them for the first time. I think Fatou is the leader since she looks the most mature and strong?
When you will do concert in India ?

Very nice song and we love you sharia❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ and blackswan
Love love  your music is awesome We saw it on tik tok and when we heard it, we immediately wanted to dance along. Every part of your song is so good that there will be no Korean people but we believe that one day you might be as famous as BLACKPINK without even realizing it. so much fun Keep fighting, we will continue to stick with you from this song. we are from thailand สู้ๆนะครับ
ปังมาก😳💕

I love sriya singing with indian language😭😭😭😭💗💗💗💗💗
Galera o que aconteceu? Precisamos ter 5m antes do dia 19 de junho! 5m em um mês seria uma boa para elas.
뮤비 영상이랑 노래가 생각보다 훨씬 좋네요! 뮤비에 가사 자막만 세계 각국 언어로 만들어주면 더 좋을듯이요~
5M GOGO
Great song, i love you guys. Warna suaranya unik semua, pokoknya keren . Terus semangat berkarya, jangan dengar mereka yang menghinamu, anggap angin berlalu.  Salam dari Army. Aku mulai suka blackswan dari dulu.  Selamat atas lagu bagusnya

Feel like their slowly getting that buzz around them that they deserve, the music is great, the choreo is on point the visuals are their they could very well be the next best female k pop group out, and the differences are their greatest strengths what’s going to allow them to grow is that they will be able to do a lot more array of music with out any negativity around it because they will be appreciating any cultural tone behind the theme often times other groups can’t do that because it comes off more appropriating rather then actual appreciation. Creating an all inclusive girl group with real talent is really going to set them apart in so many great ways then one.

Please Luminas, lets be kind to indian people that come to this video and hav opinions on it. Their culture is the one showcased here and  theyre allowed to agree or disagree. Most indian people i read here are ok on how the culture was represented, some will have different opinions.
Guyss in more than 1hr we just gained around to 7k vs which is low atleast we need 10k in 30minutes S+rə@m harder!!
4246k complete.... Only 54k left for 4.3M
Let's make it 10 million
This shame, is this k-pop? Are you seriously!? Where are the Korean girls? Where is the Korean language? Where is the dance from kpop? This is just a BIG shame!
Hi blackswan! I'm Indian and i have studied this field for a while now and have few suggestions for u!  1) the outfits were amazing but i felt the vibe of the song is more bold and the indian fits are more relaxed and cultural ,so u should have gone with some dark coloured clothings instead of pastels. 2) the indian dance and everything was worderful but as the song represents karma, i felt u should have shown the indian dance with more expression typa performance on the calm note. 3) the colours added a good touch ,i liked that part.  4) the choreography was shown less and alot of spot light was given individually, which is good but it felt very soft when the music beats are kinda high , a amazing choreography with different angle shots would have done better than spotlights. 5) at last , i would suggest u don't stick to one place like i could see u guys were trying to show beauty of India but instead of like the roads and auto if u would have chosen like wide alley or jungle type of area if would fit the representation better.
좋다.....................
I really love the rap part..
Odisha sa koe ha kya  Ya to bbsr ha na odisha ka

The next comeback gonna be even better !

🦢 Fighting
My odisha😊
Don't forget to watch the shorts when you're done with karma, since we started, the shorts above 500k are growing like crazy let's give them millions on those
Luminas who are waiting for the challenge:  Please understand that their schedule is tight, you can witness for yourselves that the swans are constantly doing activities (which is very good). The show today, Fatou's kbs french interview, and the water bomb. It will be difficult and exhausting to add a challenge now. This can effect the girls health and make them go on hiatus which we don't want. Instead stream the mv in a manner of showing support
Proud to be odia❤
🚨lets get to 5 mill so they can go to a HAUNTED HOUSE 🚨

What's that starter thing Shreya we will hate you you are Indian and showing that you properly know about India I am so disappointed about it I am fan of black swan and you are like you can't say to director evenly Director was also Indian and the name of that is "that karma " you know the meaning of karma I will hate you and now you say or do about India will will never be quite honest and you are showing to black swan members the bad things

Some non-Koreans will once again say that Koreans are racist if this group doesn't become popular in Korea.  일부 비한국인들은 만약에 이 그룹이 한국에서 인기를 못 얻으면 한국인들은 인종차별자라고 다시한번 떠들것입니다.
I can't explain how much I love this song and BlackSwan..!❤
Woah, they are so amazing!

This is talent!

Not only talented, but they are also great girls..  Funny, friendly, sweet..! Love them so much..!
Esse MV ♡

*Sriya:* "Karma is an impactful and trendy song that allows BLACKSWAN to display their performance abilities. The International sound represents global diversity and also the name Karma came from India, so this time we decided to use an Indian concept."

See, kpop groups always use beats and instruments and words of other cultures, but they never actually indulge and include them in the actual videos or songs at all. They never give credit to any cultures or show them in thier works. This is culture appreciation not appropriation. 🖤
Almost at 4M🎉🎉🎉🎉
11K Left LET'S GO 4MILLION
Views are so slow…
4M today let's go 🤍🤌
So beautiful❤
Ha ha ha ha ha 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
OMG! goosebumps!!
You girls!! Slayers!!
Falta tão pouco para 4 milhões aaaaaa amo
We hit 700k subscribers❤
환상적 FANTASTIC !
4 million 😮
A masterpiece!!!
continuem assistindo ❤❤
Loveee
Noice❤
Granted I'm not a fan of DR Music but I give them credit for their determination to make Blackswan successful. They finally seem to have the right lineup this time. But what they also did was to have a  group that speaks Korean which very important if you want to make it in Kpop. They also had these ladies appear on music shows (also very important). Hopefully this time around they will be more successful. So for all of the Rania, BP Rania fans out there, get behind these ladies so that can happen.
4M TODAY !!!
A little more to 4 million  🥰
Ended tonight
4M🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤

😍😍😍😍😍
❤❤❤❤❤
*Gabi:* "As the meaning of our title “Karma” says, all your actions affect your future. Since we, Blackswan, are doing this comeback with so much enthusiasm and passion, I feel that the good Karma is going to come around. Whereas we are doing with love, we will receive love."
4 million🎉🎉!!!
Lest go lumina
알고리즘 때문에 일에 집중이 안되네 Brrrr dadada
Wft , what they are doing just showing Indian low side and they can take any beautiful & amazing places of India but what they choose to show is every uneven and I am not able is appreciat it because of their big mistakes..😶🙄
Gorgeous❤
Os coreanos choram
Vamos por el 4m❤❤❤
Deberían ser mas reconocidas, la cancion es muy pegadiza!!!!!!!!
*NVee:* “Karma” has a very strong, confident sound. When I think of Karma there is one phrase that I remember: “What goes around comes around.” Or if you do good things, good things will come back to you. The same goes for bad. So, when you listen to this song and the lyrics, you’ll see a story behind it. There are two people who have a love for each other, one that makes them crazy and can’t stop thinking about one another. Though, one is worried that they might not have the same feelings towards them. But the other shows that they have nothing to worry about and that they want them just as much as they do. So, the story comes full circle. Passion and love were shown so they received that passion and love back.
6.1 MORE MILLION VIEWS TILL THIS HITS 10M ❤
AMAZINGGGGGGG
It's giving cheap
They showed Buddhist 'KARMA' culture with that white peace pagoda beautifully
TF is this cringe. I need some bleach for my eyes.

O clipe ficou muito bom,⭐ mas ficaria ainda melhor com as primeiras integrantes do Blackswan. Falando nisso, cadê as meninas? Cadê a Judy, a Youngheun, a Leia? Ainda bem que mantiveram a Fatou, porque se não fosse o caso, o blacksuwan não teria a menor graça. Na hora que os fãs começaram a ter um apego emocional com o grupo Blackswan/as integrantes, vem a empresa e troca tudo. Fala sério!!!!
Song is something different but the video reminds of hymn for the weekend
Don't stop str3eaming were close to 4M!
우와....❤
Can't wait for their next comeback!!

4 MILLION, we got this LUMINA! This group deserves the best after all they’ve been through. Whether it was racism, drama between members, questioned their legitimacy as a KPOP group… etc, BLACKSWAN WILL PREVAIL! These girls worked so hard. I’m proud. The views, likes, live shows, and fanbase shows that they are succeeding. GOING STRONG!!! 🩵
First Blackswan song I've listened to and THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT!! THIS IS SO GOOD 😱
'Karma' fazendo em menos de um mês o que 'close to me' fez em um ano ❤❤

Close to me hit 4M viewz in 1year and now this mv hits 4M views only in 3weeks!? Well done lumina:)
Yy
Saben creo que sí hubieran debutado bajo una empresa estadounidense, no tendrían tanto reconocimiento, y quedarán al olvidó como little mix* A pesar de todo hay que decir que la industria del kpop tiene a artistas muy completos Y si puede ser doloroso para los artistas tal entrenamiento que tienen, no cualquiera lo hace Hay fortaleza en este grupo

3887k complete.... Only 13k left..... Let's go for 3.9M
Is leia out of the group?
뭔가  한정식 집에 갔더니,  스테이크랑 스파케티 세트만 나오는 느낌?
오~~ 이언니들 너무 멋있어~.  블랙스완에개 너무 잘 어울리는 곡이에요~ 목소리가 좋은데 특히 피지컬이 다르니 동작이 시원시원해서 더 멋있어요 ~ 오래오래 봤음 좋겠어요~!
3.9 soon !
의도는 너무 좋은데..   걸그룹 시스템의 고된 트레이닝을 꾸준히 버틸수 있을까.. 체중관리가 벌써 안되는것 같은데.. 스파르타식으로 할수도 없을거고.. 제작자 고민이 클듯.. 관리만 된다면 참 좋을것 같아요.
K-POP or not, who cares. As long as the songs are good, and well presented, people will listen to and like them, then they'll become a cultural icon themselves. No need to categorize.  Cheers to the pioneers, and may their endeavors and enthusiasm lift them higher.
3.9 million soon let's go 🤍
The stars aligned, lots of success for Blackswan ❤

각 멤버들의 출신국가 한 번씩 돌아가면서 뮤비 찍으면 멋있을 것 같다. 나름 자기나라 소개도 하는 겸.
This is so beautiful 💜🥰

Konsep nya beda banget dari girlgrup lain,tapi lagunya bagus banget. Btw aku army,tp mulai saat ini sya multifandom😂😂 apa nama fandom blackswan?
Luminas Are u Sleeping Keep Comming and listning song On Youtube and Spotify ❤❤❤❤❤❤
salam dari hindu  bali , indonesia❤
뮤비 신선하다❤
오우~ 다들 키도 크고 날씬해서 아주 보기 좋아요. 비쥬얼그룹인정~
OMG They're so cooooool T^T
Now what was that a mixture of Koreans and indians .. I wanted to puke That was way too much to handle  Like I don't like it Be ur self stop making blunders
와... K-POP이 더 발전할 수 있을까 싶었는데 여기 소속사 대박이네! 엄청난 시도인데 확실히 한국 팬층들 개념이나 반응도 라떼랑 비교하면 넘 멋지게 성장했고, 외국에서 외국말로 데뷰하기까지 정말 어려웠을텐데 뮤비 퀄도 장난없고 진심 👍
Keren
홍철 없는 홍철팀...  그래도 성공 했으면 좋겠담... 예능에도 자주 나오고 ㅎ
Please put English subtitles for global fans 🙏🙏

It's better than a lot of big and famous girl group
FIGHTING 4M
This Korean group is very good since their debut, if the company knows how to manage the girls and if it continues like this they can go far
Pero que canción mas buena dios
Yayy! 700k subs. BlackSwan has encouraged me not to give up. Let's go ladies. See you at 1M.
I liked the song, it fits perfectly, and I liked the difference between the nationalities of the members concept difference Karma song Really wonderful addictive melody And the dance is quite appropriate All love to you
승승장구하길. 노력한 만큼 보상이 따랐으면 좋겠다.
N btw Nice editing on pasting their Band name in a board in one of the scene in these  music video  (scene 0:4 sec) Just a reminder no one in INDIA knows who BlackSwans are if they came to India for promotion then they went to the wrong State. They should have visited MUMBAI, DELHI,GOA,BANGALORE & NAGALAND. Where K-Pop has a huge Impact.
Cadê os fãs do Brasil gente?? Só tem gringo aproveitando essa música 😮😅❤
Amazing ❤

Indian culture was shown very well in this video
예전에 대뷔 한다는것만 알고 있었는데 벌써 이렇게 다른 타이틀 곡까지  나온것을 몰랏었네요. 곡도 좋고 맴버들 합도 좋은듯해요. 부디 누구도 법접할수없는  븍랙스완만의 자리를 만들어서 블랙핑크분들처럼 세계적으로나가셨으면해요.
this is amazing, girls!!!💘💗

외국인멤버로만 구성된 케이팝 아이돌이라니! 너무 신선하고 좋아요 ㅎㅎ 배타적인 관점으로만 바라보고 한국인 멤버가 없다고 배척시키는건 문화적 발전을 지연시킬 뿐이라는 생각이 드네요! 응원해요❤❤
So excited that some of the scenes are shot in Orissa
I AM AN INDIAN AND ALSO IN INDIA I AM FROM GUJRAT BUT I ALSO LIVED IN ODISHA AND LEARN THE LANGUAGE. I CAN EASILY SEE ODIA WRITTEN IN THE BACKGROUND.

to be honest I'm mainly a BTS stan doesn't stan others group easily specially the girl groups which are 4th gen but I'm solo stan of some girl groups. This is the song and mv which made to stan Black Swan! like I love how yall represented India and the culture everything.  I literally had goosebumps when I saw the temples in the Background  and visited most of the places where this mv was shooted and I'm really proud to be an Indian. Also the vocals , rap everything was on point me. LOVED IT SO MUCH! 🖤🦢
우연히 쇼츠때문에 알게 됐는데 라니아 멤버였네요. 라니아 때도 좋아했어요. 활동해줘서 고맙네요.
Really awsome!! I have been a fan for a long time your music is awsome!
Lest go lumina!!

I enjoyed the song alot. But the direction is everywhere and all over the place. Wasn't a big fan of direction at all. Really bad colour grading at the end of Holi colours. That purple dress was just not going well at all. In between the pop of red of buildings to the little dancer was over saturating. Kindly stick to one or two themes rather than mixing everything all at once
So Awesome ❤ They slayed 💯

the way they went to India to highlight a members beautiful world, and STILL lightens their skin in some shots is crazy to me man lmao
Love My Odisha❤
perfect and majestic
I am confused? I don't follow this group so I don't know much about them. Weren't they a 5 person group before? Also are there new members now too?
내 마지막 외멤에 대한 기억은 엑소(개그)인데 이 그룹은 외멤만 남아서 뮤비까지 찍었네. 고생했겠다. 기특하고 잘 됐으면.
Bravo les filles particulièrement notre chère Fatou 😘🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳. La musique, la danse, je veux dire tout est parfait 🤭❤❤❤❤
Doent forget to stream!

As a student who learns Odissi, I am overjoyed to see this form of dance in the M/V. Finally, Odissi got the attention that it deserves.
Pessoal falando de apropriação cultural, pelamor! Se aparecer um gringo dançando samba, por exemplo, o brasileiro vai é vibrar... Parem de problematizar tudo!
국내kpop은 한국어 가사가 실종되가는 추세인데 외국인이하는 kpop은 거의 한국어..;;
None of these ppl are korean how they in kpop then 😮
amazing!!!!
💜❤️💜❤️💜

me gusta la canción y muy visual el mv.
No me atajo el video pero si la música y la coreografía, ellas son muy buenas, tiene único estilo más maduro, no me gusta grupos con temática infantil, grupos como este, deben destacarse.
Such a cool song
ALMOST 4MIL🎉🎉
Does blackswan have Lightstick?
Wow

We're really close to 4M, that's amazing!

Los luminia tendrán que rezar tanto para que está alineación sea eterna. Aunque todo fandom reza por qué su banda no se separen. Y hay quienes rezan para que hagan otro comeback, como me duele está industria. 😢

블랙스완은 처음엔 한국인 4명으로 시작해서 그룹활동을 시작했는데 나중에 한국인 2명이 문제가 생겨 2명 빠지고 외국인 2명 긴급 수혈해서 4인조로 활동하다가 별로 성과가 없자 나머지 한국인 2명이 또 빠져나가고,,그런 후 외국인 2명으로 다시 채워 지금 외국인 4명으로 활동 중,,인도인, 벨기에(세네갈인), 독일인, 일본계 브라질인 총 4명,,순수한 외국인 4인조 그룹
3,8 million

This gonna be a long long comment so bear with me . 1. Really appreciate their company for bringing up the different countries girls together in Korea without any Korean member.. its really difficult to gain people faith specially in Korea where beauty standards are so high 2. Producer of this song ... The blend of indian n hip-hop music with korean lyrics is commendable 3. Production of mv, beauty of india n their costumes are amazing 4. Girls are really rocking... Dance, vocal n rap everything is just perfect Keep rocking girls 🎉🎉🎉🎉
MY ODISHA 😊🎉
Simply waoh
Let's make this group  the best girl group❤😊
I don't even stan them but this song is legit fire! I watched all the performance stages and they nailed all of them!❤❤❤✨

Damn!! It really hit differently.🔥
Wow
Пісня дуже гарна, і кліп теж. Але монтаж....  КАРМА
노래 좋은데?
They had a cell phone and a dream haha
인도풍의 뮤비에 한국과 인도 느낌 섞인 노래라니. 몽환적이고 마음에 든다. 한국인이 없으니 이건 K-POP가 아니라 하지만 한국인의 입장에서는 이 노래가 K-POP의 특징을 가지고 있기 때문에 충분히 K-POP고 이런 시도가 좋다고 생각함.
This MV deserve 100M+ views🔥
ඇත්තටම ගොඩක් ලස්ස්න්‍යි  ❤
Está  incrível  🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
K-POP🇰🇷🎤💜 아이돌이 되고 싶은데 어울리지 않아

*_My mother for the first time listened to a k-pop song bruh. I told her that it was shooted in India and there is an Indian girl too so she agreed to watch it, she would never 😭. I'm literally very proud of Blackswan now 🖤_*
Sanatani culture is just❤❤🔥
They deserve more views. I think cause this channel have started in 2012 , it become really old. Become the channel is too old, most of the people don't know about this group yet. The company really needs to concentrate on opening fresh YouTube channel for their popularity and success. It's really important for their growth. "KARMA" is first song for the four members. The song is really amazing. I hope they'll receive more achievements in future.💖
I don't like India because India is not a clean country🤢

Heard this song yesterday and immediately fell in love with them, rooting for their success ❤️
블랙스완 완성도에 내가다 뿌듯하다.....한국어 위화감 제로 오히려 잘들림
i dont usually like korean song too much coz i dont know what  they say but this song is incredible .wohhhhhh.just hilarious.
Lots of love from Odisha 🙏

Worst quality
DIVAS
lovely watching spotify and Youtube 😀😀
lovely
🎶 Brrr... Ta ta ta... 🎶 is so addictive!  3,7M really?! They deserve more. I'm an InSomnia & found this MV by accident. I keep listening & slowly enjoying it. I'm so intrigued because of members & searching about the group profile. It's weird K-Pop group doesn't have Korean members & shooting MV in India. Then I found out the producer is dr. Music same with RaNia. That's why they have albums with RaNia's songs on it. Now I miss RaNia more than before. So bad BlackSwan's point is so low on music show Pre-Vote.
I hate how underrated they are  We need to give them 10M bc they're so talented
Just realized that they say "get you like" and not "bi+ch you like"
India Korea lady 👍🙏
❤️ hare Krishna ❤️👌👌👍👍
This really cool❤
Wow beautiful

Isiliye Indian ko Mein gadha bevkuf bolata hun Jara Sar kisi Korean ne apne song mein Bharat ki Chabi vah bhi Garib aur  poverty class wali dikha de  India ki dekh kar khush ho gaye no respect India country your song Korea

Obsessed!
Bravoo las acabo de conocer que increíble! Me encanta la diversidad de tonos de piel en el grupo.
Guys I've noticed that we're making 100k vi3ws in a day which means 1M in 10 days and we have only 14 days left before this MV reach 1 month so, let's work hard and give them at least 5M to 6M before 19th June.  (We couldn't give them first win & the album sales is very low so this is the least we could do for them)
Need more editing
I hope in their next comeback the views and streams will double
Black pink এর carbon copy

블랙스완...전에한번 음악프로에서봤었습니다 한참동안 잊고있었는데 활동중이였군요 그때는 저 흑인 멤버가 그룹네 최초에? 흑인멤버?라면서 홍보하는걸봤습니다 음악프로에서도 눈에뛰기도하더라고요 길고 이뻤던 멤버 그때는 카리스마컨셉?이였는데 요새는청순인가봐요 . 오묘하니 멤버들도 다 이뿌네요 이제..곡만 잘받으면 될것같네요 뮤비는 이뻐네여

Finally 😊 this is beautiful.
One of the best mv I have ever seen in awhile
무대 보고 왔는데 뮤비도 넘 예쁨 😳 회사가 작정한 것 같은데 계속 이렇게 지원해줬으면!!! 예능도 많이 나가고 틱톡도 마니 해주길..
음색미쳐따
이 노래 많이 들어서 당연히 한국가수 노래인줄 알았는데...실력이라던지 비주얼이 놀랍네요.
Why you show India so badley i hate you
Why you copy dance of black pink  No one wanted to be blackswan fan  Yack 🤢🤢👎👎👎
뮤직비디오 되게 좋네요 :)
노래 중독성 머야 스타일링도 너무 멋지고 잘됐으면 좋겠네요!!!!
Thank you so much Black Swan for showing our Indian culture to whole world 🙏🙏keep going guys we are always with you.........
Salute 🫡🙌
Sriya❤️
🌸🌷
this mv has the kost accurate expression of India, not overly dramatic and not something that undermines a nation. very good!
와 멋지다
SO COOL!!!
I am getting goosebumps on how good this is!!!☺☺ I am Indian and I am not telling this cause I am an Indian  This song is just tooooooo good One of my fav songs✨✨ Love u guys 💖
외국인 여자 한명 탈퇴했나? 원래 있던 애 얼굴이 안보이는데

Someone fire their stylist because the outfits 😐
4M 가자 가자!
As an Indian k-pop stan i feel so proud and happy about this song. The mv is set in India and the song's name is also karma.😊  P.s. Karma is originally a sanskrit word used a lot in hindu scripture and epic, The Gita,which means what you sow is What u reap. We💜u sriya...  🇮🇳💜🇮🇳 I also love and appreciate the fact that there are no attempts made to modernize India's image and all. It is a proper depiction of India and its people and our rich cultural heritage ..🇮🇳🇮🇳
❤❤❤❤
The song is perfect vocals,, video , dance everythimg....
Day 9 watching karma mv until 100 mil
shot in odisha 🙌🙌
If you like "itzy" you will probably like this song!!! "Alina Smith", who has written songs for itzy, is one of the writers of Blackswan's "Karma"!!

Wow me encanta ❤,son magníficas e inigualables,mucho éxito chicas 🎉❤
I am so so so happy they finally have a good song. I have wanted success for this group for so long and I think NVee is such a good addition. I love that she's thick by KPOP standards. (Which is still pretty thin but at least it's a start). I love that they're really setting the bar for cultural appreciation!!! Honestly I was afraid the diversity was just a gimmick but they seem to actually be celebrating the girls' unique heritage. Fingers crossed for their continued success.
2:30 Iconic part ❤❤ (According to me)
These girls look so pretty amidst the voyage of colors
OMG I love this comeback so much, the music video and quality of the song has gone up so much since close to me, makes me so happy and excited to see their progression as a group 💗
Its been a while since I've liked a kpop ......❤
This song is awesome
I'm an odia!! So proud that Sriya Lenka an odia girl reaching heights and making odisha and India proud!!! You go girl!!! Tame full bobaal karucha!🎉🎉🎉
Woah! Is kpop industry dying that they started making songs in India for trp in the name of "representing culture"
Love it❤❤
LETS PASS 5M STREAMS‼️‼️ WE CAN DO IT GUYS🎉
I just love the music video.ive already seen more than 10 times.the song is catchy too.
This song has a refreshing vibe that attracted people to listen it more. Not only refreshing but also the vocal is not jock, the rap is Cathy, the concept is insane!! Let's stan them forever >3
This song is really catchy ☺❤👏
Day 8 of watching karma mv until 100 mil

Amé demasiado, chicas muy talentosas 🙌
you go my girls 💝💯
Tiraram mesmo a leia coitada kkkk e botaram um integrante horrorosa e ainda com uns figurinos feiosos mas a música e boa
Personel baru blackswaw lumayan skillnya
예전에 이분들 영상 우연히 보고 신기하다~ 래퍼분 걸크러쉬 장난아니다~ 이러고 그냥 넘겼던것같은데, 이번노래는 뭔가 중독성도 있고 잘뽑힌것같아요ㅎㅎ 그때는 한국멤버도 있었던것같은데, 지금은 다 외국멤버분들만 계신가봐요? 근데 다들 한국어 발음도 너무 좋고 넘 예쁘고 영상 퀄리티도 좋네요~ 일단 이번노래 뭔가 따라부르게 되는 후렴구가 있어서 더 잘되시면 좋겠고, 응원할게요^^
Go to 4 million
Nice Song ❤️
Amazing song

SUSAH KALAU TAK ADA MEMBER ASAL KOREA SELATAN KARENA MUSIK KOREA TETAP MENGUTAMAKAN IDOL ASAL KOREA!
Insomnia here.. yuk bisa yukkkkkkk
That karma!
It is shooting in dhauli of odisha India.
Why was there need to show things and myths about india that are westernised like buffaloes on the road and poverty india has far more developed than this they're just defaming the popularity of india I request that strict action should be taken against this and it should be banned
Okay - IMO this song and MV have reached legendary status; I just know I'll still be listening to/watching Blackswan's "Karma" a dozen years from now and more.  It's just that perfect and timeless; it's everything.
Where is the leader
WE AIMING FOR AT LEAST 5 MILLION
their best yet

이런걸 우린 찢었다라고 하지... 와우
80K til 3.4 milllion !
Fatou is a flippin queen
이 팀. 지구 파괴도 바라지만, 한국에서 특히 떴으면 좋겠다. 태권도의 사례처럼, 케팝이 더 잘되고 입지도 더 공고히 하려면, 케팝을 표방한 외국인들의 봇물 데뷔와 성공 사례가 나와 줘야 하기 때문임. 그 첫 사례가 이 팀이 된다면 좋을 것. 이 팀의 실력과 노력 그리고 이번 곡의 퀄리티가 충분히 그럴 자격을 갖추고 있음. 乃
Iindass
Very beautiful talented young ladies I can't wait to follow!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Black Swan are adorable
Fatou's deep voice, uhh
Masterpiece

I haven't stopped listening to this song since the day I first heard it. Proud to be LUMINA! All the good KARMA to you, BLACKSWAN!
Sriya s starting line is giving vibe at night 3 am
최근 알게 된 그룹인데 진짜 노래 좋네요.👍 4명 다 너무 잘 어울리고 한국인이 한명도 없는데 확실히 Kpop 느낌도 잘 살고 노력을 엄청 한 것 같아 제가 다 뿌듯하네요. 이 그룹은 정말 엄청 흥했으면 좋겠네요!! 💯
Rolóoooon

Amazed by the new k-pop 👑 queens
I don't stan them but Sriya is such a good dancer!, i've seen other videos of her too, she's really good, she's the main dancer right? i would even dare to say she's better than some of the most famous female idols right now that are supposed to be the best ones, i don't want to mention names so not to cause bad comments haha, but i'm really impressed.
Proud of you sriya

Location too bad😢
As an Odia, it feels so so nice and warm and fuzzy to see my state being appreciated because in India, we get overlooked and underestimated a lot. This video captures so many mesmerizing places in my state - the innumerable temples we have, the villages, our classical dance even Dhauli, I hope Sriya finds success in whatever she wishes to do in the future and Blackswan continues to slay uwu
Proud to be an Odia Lumina! ❤✨keep Shining girls, you rock!
It's a very good music video. good at singing and dancing❤️ I will continue to follow your work.  i like this song very much.🙂♥️

Love from India
Simple and unique
Black pink 💋 black Swan  fake
I want to ask, did they record the MV using cellphones? The quality of the MV is really bad, although the concept is Vrindapan but it's worse than my school assignment hahaha. This is probably the worst MV I've ever seen. That's just my opinion, if you don't like it, that's fine😂
Happy Sriya 7200 days
I'm literally addicted to this song and it's on repeat on my playlist. I'm so proud that it was shooted in Odisha

Blackswan
Amo!!
Well I really enjoyed this music video. I know there has been a lot of accusations of cultural appropriation in kpop over the years but I must say. This video is the PERFECT example of cultural appreciation. I am not sure if one of the members is Indian but I can see how much effort they put into showing a just a glimpse of Indian culture. Nothing here felt like a prop or a joke. Lovely ladies well done.
I really proud that they showed Indian cluture
This shit bangs
hey I'm new here, i have a question. is this their formation since their debut? Or did they change their members?
poker face
Love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
31 Mag: 3.1 mln views, 356k likes, 30k comm. 680k subs

I really love this song!! I'm obsessed 😍

Proud to be an odia and proud of Sriya and all the BLACKSWAN members.... They're visuals vocals dance everything was excellent! Love from Odisha💝
its a beautiful song tbh bro a masterpiece
Çok iyisiniz bağımlılık yaptı şarkı
The thing with this group compared to other “foreigner” KPOP groups is that the company puts effort into the visuals, sound, choreography, and MV budget. They don’t make the “foreigner” aspect the main focus, but rather each of their individual talent. The production just seems so clean and polished. LUMINA FOREVER!!!! 🤍🤍🤍
My new idols ❤❤❤
Watch their live performance as well🖤🖤 and promote them everywhere ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥✨ gooo blackswan 😊
Odisha ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Only Like who from Odisha
THE VISUALS IN THIS GROUP ARE INSANEEEEEEE
Tá  perfeito
입에 짝짝 붙네 이거 역대 수능금지곡
The mv is showing the culture of odisha i am so happy with this mv loved it!!!!
ดีมากๆเลย
Can it be considered the same group even if almost all of the members have been changed?
Dhauli yay!!!
Aí sim😊
This is awesome 👍👍
less than 20k to hit 3.2 now !
Slayyyy
3.2M soon!!
O mv vai fazer duas semanas 02/06 será que a gente consegue 4 milhões até lá?
Sriya is so perfect and the head ticking she did that absolutely stunning
One side there is lee hyori sexually gayatri mantra (utterly disgusting) and blackpink  keeping lord ganesh statue beside their feet and mocking the classical dance without even caring about their Indian Viewers and on the other side is Blackswan . Yeah i know that they are just shooting an MV in India not a big deal but still the company is better than their competitors in the industries like yg and all.
Amzing Soo cool wao so Gorgeous diva wha wha sooo
so Cool waoaoo so damn cool woa Gorgeous diba wha wha spoo diva wah wah sooo Diva wha wha sooo
i love blackswan
hermosas
wow
3,2 million lumina come on!!!
A comment said that this group is the better than most kpop groups but this group can barely keep members. Last time I saw them was “close to me” that group was good. Not this. I’m sorry like their company just can’t keep members and it’s annoying having to learn new members and then taking a liking to them just for them to leave. (This is my opinion so if you have a problem voice it somewhere else cause I’m not gonna fight over an opinion)
I hated this song   👊👊👊👊👎👎👎👎👎👎😠🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩😡😡👿👿🖕🖕🖕😡😡😡🥴🥴🥴
THE TRANSITIONS OMG PERFECT
SOOO GOOD
Arrasaram muito, por favor, Dr Music, não dê mancada agora que as meninas estão ganhando atenção. Que o próximo comeback não demore, e que seja tão surpreendente quanto este.
guys also listen their cat and mouse song.... it is also an amazing song😍😍😍....
elas estão indo muito bem, parabéns!
블랙스완보고있나 담앨범은 디즈니공쥬컨셉으로 해쥬세여! 공주인데 내삶은 내가 개척하는느낌으로 개쩔겠다ㅠㅠㅜㅠ🥲🥲
A cada manhã temos uma nova performance em palco pra apreciar. Gostaria de assistir cara-a-cara esses momentos mas resido do outro lado do globo. Meninas vocês estão maravilhosas.
Ok listen I have t watched blackswan since the old line up I’m saying old line up because I see 3 new members and the others are gonna and fatou is still here but back to what I was saying no hate love blackswan but they didn’t have the best music before and the best energy the group really didn’t fit each other in my opinion but this new line up is literally eating I feel like the energy and vocals fit each other so well  you can disagree with me if u want but this new line uk up is EATING IT UP
I was following them for a while but this one definitely stands out to me...i loved everything about this MV
케이팝의 새 시대

그래 좋은 현상이다. kpop이라고 해서 꼭 한국인 멤버가 있어야 할 필요는 없지. 이제 세계적인 팝 장르중 하나가 되었으니까! 음악적 색깔만 kpop 색깔을 보여준다면 문제될게 없지.
오 랩 쩐당
Fatou's deep voice rap!! 😍 I can't!! Such a beauty!!❤️❤️
Faltou está tão linda caramba
quem diria que uma brasileira seria a mais coreana de um grupo de kpop
I like Vato a lot! My dream is to attend their concert! but I'm from Russia 😭
400만 가보자고~~!!
it’s amazing guys ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

This song deserves much more recognition.
love from India ❤❤
Shooting 😭❤ in udaygiri india
lets get 4 milly!!!!!!!!!!
love it
This is embarrasing, no one likes Black Swan. Only losers. All their songs are shit and K-Pop stands for Korean Pop so members should be from asian countries.. this is so sad to see what K-Pop has become even the black girl has shit vocals. 0/10.
Wow amazingly done  I really liked the way they showed indian culture❤❤❤
Love you girls ❤❤❤❤
Let's make it to 10 million soon guys
I'm not your fan but you are so unique
Guys don't give up we have to reach 10 million 😢 asap please stre@m every day 🙏🏽🙏🏽🥺🥺they literally worked hard this time after getting so much hate so please support them 🙏🏽
Jai sri Ram I liked it  a lot  🙏🏻 ❤ so much  about  Indian  culture
Last friday I was in a car accident with a truck and this song was playing while it was happening (felt like I was in a movie or music video, best soundtrack)
❤❤❤
350k like complete congratulations🎉🥳
Lumina, let’s get them 10 million views in 1 month! We can do this, LETS GO!!🖤🦢🖤🦢
Atiba sundaram....i have no words for this grps...they showed our pure India....my respect for Shreya mam now grew much more....she proved that she is an Indian....m proud of you Shreya di....keep going....💜
Why are the views freezing , YouTube needs to get it together
Con esta canción me vuelvo oficialmente fan, QUE BUENA CANCIÓN.!! 🥳😻
This song displayed all the culture of India that even Indians couldn't show in songs 😮😊
We are very proud of you guy's ❤❤❤❤
This member lineup and this formula (both in business and aesthetics) really really works! They've caught my attention to the point of me looking for almost every Karma performance. If DR Music can keep this consistently in comebacks to come, I'm sure many people will stan them.
berasa ngeliat blackpink
okay budget !! 😍

Extremely proud as an Odia 🤌❤️ This is so beautiful ❤️ Shot in dhauli and some old parts of old town in Bhubaneswar, this is so so so diverse and vibrant 🤌
still fr0z3n a bit...
The first k-pop song that is shooted in india and our first indian k-pop idol and the vocal of Gabi and navee is just killing us and the rap of fatou is just amazing 😍 no words to describe them.. and the dance of sriya is just amazing 😊😊
Loveeee it 🤌💜
Let's make it 100 M luminas🙏🥰👑
Gabi sounds like Jisoo from BLACKPINK
❤Youngheun❤ ❤Fatou❤ ❤Hyeme❤ ❤Leia❤ ❤Judy❤ ❤Gabi❤ ❤Sriya❤ ❤NVee❤ ❤BLACKSWAN❤
Im so happy for indian girl❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
No offense and no hate but i dont find this song cool i mean they potraited india thats nice but not just to show indian culture just for views because sriya is from india and indias population and kpop  following is also good so thats the reason
Watching my incredible INDIA here make me feel soo proud thankyou sriya for making our INDIA proud and these girls are fire🔥
Is it kpop or indian cultural view
when u need views just show indian XD .. its not like they respect our culture . all they need views thats why india XD🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They didnt come to play
Me encanta la canción sigamos apoyando a BLACKSWAN (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)⁠✧⁠*⁠。
they are barbies in real life❤‍🔥
Love from odisha❤
한국인이 없다고 K팝이 아닌게 아닌데 ㅋㅋ 멤버 전원이 한국어로 부르는데.. 정작 한국인들은 하나도 신경 안 쓰는데 한국인 없다고 까는게 좀 웃기네
와 뭐임 노래 개좋네
kya bakwas h ye
pareceu muito musica descartada do blackpink, principalmente os intrumentais de fundo e a parte do rap
LET'S GET 3.5 MILLION TILL DAY 13 STARTS
they have so much potential omg
한국말로 부르면 왜 한국말로 많이 부르는데 노래와 영상이 으뜸
Idc what anyone thinks, BLACKSWAN are queens!
전곡을 한국어로 하지 않으시는데 저는 노래도 좋고 여자분들도 잘하고 노래도 많이 불러서 좋아요
isso ta mto bom
That's odisha Bhubaneswar famous place dhaudi guyssss❤
🖤
AMAZING SLAY
v13w$ are stuck sadly..
Taylor swift dropped her song Karma right after this song blew up wonder why 😏🤔
Go! go!! go!!! Blackswan.

LEST GO
I just want other fans to realize this. It's been barely two weeks and this video has gotten over 3 million views. Counting only the views on the official videos from their youtube channel, KARMA has nearly 3/4ths the amount of the views that CLOSE TO ME has after a year. KARMA has nearly 3/5ths of the amount of views that TONIGHT has after two years. Imagine how many more views we could get for this in a matter of days!!!!
Já sou fã ❤❤❤❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Só faltou a coreana pra ser um grupo de kpop.
Wow this song is so cool 😇
AHHHHHH IT’S AMAZINGGGGG
I'm here every day ❤🇲🇦

Yayyyy 3.1M!! Let's get into 4M luminas!!!!!!
The rappers voice is soo strong i like that 💖✨ slayyy
3 million wow
Brooo i discovered them today from the show, the song is so good, i usually don't listen to other groups other than Dreamcatcher xD as i'm not that into k-pop and prefer rock, but i've got a feeling i won't stop listening to this song for a loong time. They seem so talented. Also their visuals and choreo are insane, specially the blonde girl, i'm speechless with the beauty of her face, she looks unreal! 😳. I feel they should be bigger!, i honestly think they have so much carisma and potential to be one fo those groups in big festivals and with big crowds in their concerts, i don't say this just to be kind or sympathetic, its an objective statement.
우와
3.1 mil let's goooo Getting close to close to me mv ¥!€₩$
Alguém cria um grupo no WhatsApp só pra falar delas ??? Precisos reunir os fãs pra apoiar elas nos números
They are mixed of beauty, talented sexy girls ;)
10 million will sure in 1 month🔥dont give up luminas
I think the video could be better it's extra vibrant plus hands gestures/ moves are like way more than required.
Really in love with the amount of energy they have been putting into this comeback. FATE HAS BEEN KIND TO BLACKSWAN FINALLY!!
might have to stan honestly
Can we get 10 million in one month?
I really like the song, Blackswan is the best
PERFECT ALL KILL!!!!
SO COOL
my heart ❤❤‍🔥❣💞💗💝💘💛💚🧡🖤🤍💙
Coollll ❤❤❤❤
Eu gostei muito da música
I’m confused about this group. Are they Korean nationals or are they not Korean nationals?
3M!!!!!
Wow... Keren
노래 개좋냐 ㅁㅊ
OMG!! Qué canción tan chévere! Todas son muy hermosas y lo hicieron increíble ❤️‍🩹
Parfact song 😍😍😍😍🇧🇩
이번 프로모션에 회사 재산을 모두 탕진했다고 한다... 이번엔 아주 사활을 걸고 컴백했던 거라는 소문이 들린다는..
I Love Bollywood 👍🤩👍✨
To you so called Blackswan supporters, who keep posting past controversy about previous members, please chill.   New Era for Blackswan. ❤️ Trinidad 🇹🇹
No green screen, a true work of art! 🦢🖤
Let's get 4M viewz in 1Months? Fighting lumina
هذا رائع يا رفاق في 10 أيام 3m أنه انجاز لنستمر في دعم فتياتنا انهم يستحقون
이열~닥터뮤직 웬일이냐ㅋㅋ 윤등룡이 이제 제대로 해보는겨?
Beautiful ❤️❤️
stop deleting youtube!!
Every thing is ok but the dress in every part and the makeup is ... whatever! Queens slayedddd💅
youtube don't delete viévvs
是我见过最漂亮的女团！歌曲很有特点很有记忆力，祝福她们未来发展更好！
this line-up should be untouchable.  i hope if DR Music wants to debut more idols of different nationalities, they should make a different group instead of adding them to Blackswan.  Blackswan already had too many re-lineups. new fans might unstan if the line-up would always change.  this 4-piece is already an obvious keeper.
Arrasaram❤
I like how they show indian especially odisha...but i don't like they dance infornt of. ....god...in front of temple we worship and respect..them so it felt little bad .... odissi dance inside temple okey but not modern dance....
CONSEGUIMOS BATER 3M🤩 AGORA VAMOS BATER 4M 🔥🇧🇷

Go Go gooo
100만 조회수 넘으면 2배속 댄스 하기로 했고 300만 넘으면 번지 점프를 하는 것으로 알고 있는데 번지 점프대에 올라가면 밑에서 보던 것보다 엄청나게 무섭죠. 그래도 팬들과의 약속이니까 처음 데뷔할 때를 생각해서 굳은 마음으로 모두 무사히 성공하기를 바랍니다.
Atleast listen to it 10 times only then we'll be able to make it to 10 million soon ❤❤❤

왠만한 1군 여돌 외국인멤들보다 발음, 비주얼, 실력이 훨씬 좋은데..?? 진짜 잘됐으면 좋겠다..❤️
intro가 진짜 장난아니다 노래 처음 시작할때 그냥 소름 그자체..  컨셉이 처음 보는 느낌이어서 신선해서 충격먹음
Brasil perdendo talentos para outros países por falta de incentivo à cultura, se tivesse dado mais incentivo poderia ter estas bandas brasileiras (pois existe 2 no grupo) e levado o nome ao mundo, parabéns as nossas conterrâneas ao mundo kpop
소름돋아요 누나들. 노래 너무 좋은데? 이대로만 계속 곡내줘요 이번 곡 역대급 🥰
this sounds beautiful
3m 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Wow... this song is so addractive🤧💗

한국인 없는 케이팝그룹이 한국음악프로에서 1등할 역사적인 순간이 기다려지네요~😘
I think this is the first Kpop song with an Indian concept
Oh my God 😳 what would make me more happy that kpop representing aur india...🤧🥹 Sriya lenka I'm so proud of you 🫡🤗

OMG Bhubaneswar and Puri 👌🤭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love it yrr❤❤ super mind blowing 🎉❤
Its shot in India, represents Indian culture & all thanks to Sria for this but what really impressed me is she's not dominating the MV each one of them are equally involved.
Love love love ❤ Fire fire fire 🔥
이 뮤비는 큰 화면으로 봐야함..  폰으로만 볼때는 화려한 색감이 눈이 먼저 들어오는데 PC로 보면 건축이나 패턴들 너무 매력적으로 잘 담았어.. 어제부터 몇번째 보는지 모르겠다.. 블랙스완 흥해라!
1:40  i luv her voice!
The way it represents India is so beautiful every time I watch this I feel proud to be an Indian
Okay 1, 2 show me what you like  Is my favourite line  I love this Karma song  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰
I hope they promote on running mam
Smooth run mv
Remember when Blackswan was sued by Tupac family for stealing his music in the beginning 😂
This is so cheap and it's not even KPOP, Now United 4ss band
Love this song so much. Love how they are promoting indian culture
Damn this is addictive.. guess you girls got a new fan❤
와.. 뭐야 한국어가 들려 이랬는데 케이팝.. (?) 머지 대박이다 노래 뭐야 컨셉머야..미쳤네 대박 매력.. 와..
Nice performance!

그들은 더 이상 이 그룹에 누굴 넣어야 할지 모르겠고, 내가 가장 좋아하는 브라질인 멤버를 빠뜨렸으며, 더군다나 케이팝과 무관한 문화를 도용했습니다.
3M🎉

노래가 좋아서 당황스러워요....정말조으네여......

Such a beautiful music video. Absolute perfection, I love it. <3
Well done, I like everything, I appreciate your voice ,dance Or specialy indian concept but you all have to make your  songs in english not in particular language like korean. You can also make your songs with hindi rap. Believe me you'll be better then any k pop group or become a very famous band internationally. 😘😘
Keep streaming Lumina :)
In love with the song...❤  that karma ❤
Congrats for 3 million
❤🎉
wow. thank you so much for not appropriating Indian culture. it's sad, but k-pop idols often times mock our culture, our dance, our food, all the while using our culture for their aesthetics like bindis and mangtikas, even using our hand mudras in their dances. for this very reason i've had a hard time listening to some k-pop bands. but this was so beautiful and appreciative of our culture that it brought tears to my eyes. thank you so much! it's not only that you guys highlighted Indian fashion and tourism, but also gave our women and our traditional dancers a place in your MV, which is really the coolest thing. thank you, seriously! hopefully this will bring a positive change in the k-pop world and perhaps some idols will feel shame for mocking and appropriating ours and other cultures in the future.
Beautiful!!! 🥰 Showing the true diaspora of the Asian continent 💕 화이팅!!! 🔥🔥🔥
3M 🎉
I liked it 😊
3 million 🎉
Amo esta canción ❤️🥹

Lumina is unstoppable 🤍🤍3mil milestone !
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD OMG
this is so cool.
This MV could not possibly be more gorgeous - I honestly feel I'm seeing history being made here as Blackswan leads Kpop into a whole new era, one that is truly and joyfully global.  Other groups and companies announced plans to go in this direction but backed out - and now these four spectacular ladies and their company are leading the way.  They have a great, great deal to feel proud about!!!
This is actually one of their best songs I'm in love
Congrats blackswan!!!!
Congratulations 3M views  🎉🎉🎉🥳🎉🥳🎉🥳🎉🥳
LUMINA WE REACHED 3 MILLION <3

1 :48 Me checking myself out in the mirror 😂
솔직히 이번에 좋았음. 윤등룡이 각성했나? 베이비복스 이후로 이렇다할 뭔가 없더니. 20년의 기간보다 더 된 그 구시대적 마인드 가득한 꼰대가 아직도 회사의 대표이지만, 이번엔 혁신하려 하는가보군..
Goal:  6 months: 5 million views  1 year: 10 million
Почему европейские девочки поют на корейском? У меня рассинхрон с реальностью😅
Rumo aos 4M
Who will support BLACKSWAN forever raise your hand? 🖐🖐❤

무대 영상보고 왔는데 뮤비가 이런 느낌일 줄은 전혀 몰랐네 그동안 블랙스완 뮤비 중에 젤 퀄 높은 것 같음 근데 퀄리티랑 다 좋은데 무대 의상 입고 찍는 장면도 있었으면 좋았을 듯? 멤버가 많이 바뀌었네 글구
That was awesome k-pop song in indian look wow

They could have shot in Konark sun temple also.
Sooo close to 3 mil 🤍
블랙스완 무조건 뜬다
This is the first k-pop to shoot in India.
I noticed that they (probably) don’t use ads, this mv is getting organic attention from their small fanbase. 2.9M with 338k likes is huge! I see some kpop MV with like 5M+ and less than 10k likes. Upset they don’t have in the 10M but I’m sure they’ll grow well if they’re consistent
I❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤u

People often deny big 3 privilege but look at BM content views vs BS.. How saturated the industry is & how difficult it is to gain attention. FF in that regard is a rookie monster. They did the unthinkable with just 1 global hit.

BEST CONCEPT EVER
remember 10 mil for bungee jump, let’s make it happen !!
yes queens!
_As meninas estão juntas como nunca 😍😘_
Wow
LETS GOOO 3M!!
India is so beautiful ❤
I love the visuals !!! It’s a great beginning for those 4. It literally looks like 4 princesses ready to unite the world and I’m all for it. The girls are talented, smart and looks kind to each other. Hopefully, soon enough Nvee will catch more of what is saying in Korean but no pressure. I just want her to be feel comfortable ❤ I do hope there won’t be too much change among the girls and that they will truly get recognition for their hard work 🙏🏻🙌🏻
Congratulations on the comeback
Hermosoooooooooo❤❤❤ ❤❤❤ me encantoooooooooo

Even the worst song can be the best. If you add rap of Guru Randhawa, Honey Singh, mg to your song.❤️ Because this is the vice of Indian beats.

파투 진짜 수고많았어요 이제 맞는옷입은듯 하네요 컨셉 노래 맴버구성 너무좋아요!! 떡상갑시다 ㅠ
Está es la oportunidad para su fandom el poder demostrar el potencial que tiene el grupo, el tema está increíble, fácilmente puede viralizarse en plataformas grandes, no pasen esto por alto. KARMA es muy adictiva, regresaron con todo.
From music to visual to costume to attitude to concept....just one word. Fire..
Ati sundar ❤

People are just fool to only follow famous, because this is just soooo amazing song and i showed my mom also. As an Indian and also odian we are proud of this group . Can't beleive people are not noticing it.
BLACKSWAN ILY🌸🩷🌸🩷🌸🩷
I hope today we make 3million 😢😢
Day 3 of watching karma music video until 100mil
Black pink - black swan!📍🦢
you shouldn't need to make an album first, but prioritize promoting it first to appear on various broadcasts after the sun starts shining you just make an album to sell promotion Fromance is more important than the album
Feels great to see an Indian state which has been kept hidden “Odisha” in for so long is been featured in an international album.
We did 2.8 guys🎉🎉🎉

Let's go 3 million, let's go 3 million

THE BRIDGE IS SOO GOOD
KEREN BET SUMPAH !!
It's odd to me that this song wasn't fully in english. Would've been more marketable to a wider global demographic. I'm sure they have an English version already, though.
ଆମ ଓଡ଼ିଶା ❤
So none of them are Korean? Why not just do English music at this point...it's not gonna work in Korea, sorry.

The white structure is from Dhauli giri, Bhubaneswar?
This is how you appreciate culture. This is beautiful
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 😍 ✨️
I am proud of sriya for being the first kpop idol from my country and state
컨셉이 흥미롭다
First kpop mv that doesn't use green screen, everything natural
In my opinion, its lucky you girls have Indian member in this group and the MV that shoots in India also helps for views number... Hopefully your album sales will be getting better. You girls have the voices and the look.
Blackswan isn't really suitable to be a kpop Idol, it's better to just dance the cover 🤣
я надеюсь это будет ОЧЕНЬ удачный камбек
I think this video needs 100 million views
More 28k subscribers to 700K!! Happy lumina!
Almost 700k subscribers! Let's go lumina! Share!
Almost 2.8M
Let's go to 3M before 10 days! Fighting hard lumina!
This is just so beautiful MV i have ever seen. Girls looking gorgeous in this mv
+++ очень прикольно, мне понравилось !!!
Why I love this more than k-pop!  I'm so happy 😊 This needs more attention.... Why this is underrate ..
Just fix it so it's a dance cover, Blackswan I don't think it's appropriate to be a kpop group but there aren't any Koreans huh
"Which Indian aesthetic would you like?" "Yes"
화이팅!!
i’m fucking obsessed with this
The fact this is the most faster viewz of  blackswan!
Fatou is definitely my bias
Up
Less than 300K till 3M y'all!!!

Vamos pros 3m!elas merecem
At 1:04 there's a mango tree in the background, and those yellow tiny things are flowers of mango. As an Indian myself it connects to me because every year looking at them and waiting for mangoes has been a inseparable part of my life. Those flowers bring the hope and excitement of tasty sweet fragrant mangoes.
🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
I like sooo much karma 👏👏👏👏💕🇮🇳
Logo vão ser as Quenns👑
Blackswan tá Perfeito❤
The most beautiful song I've heard
Shreya Di you are awesome
As a non korean group , there korean is really great which doesn't make it feel like they are not korean except their appearance.When the colour splashed towards them, it was really good. As a kpop group, they are doing a great job. Even though I don't know korean and the video didn't have English subs but still I didn't felt like stopping the mv. The rap part was good . I hope this group keep making great music and I request the company to add eng subs ,so, that more people can understand their music better.

Who are not aware "Karma" is a Sanskrit word which is one of the ancient language of India which literally means deed, action, act. Later it added to the English dictionary.  In india we believe one's whole life is surrounded by his Karma(कर्म)

No need to throw away their good talent in the kpop industry who don't appreciate them, it's better to directly bring them to the talent in the hollywood industry.
I'm lumina 🖤🦢 i love blackswan
It's giving Classy by Classy. Maybe I'm the only one not digging LYRE.

Dislike🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Oooooo, this one is good
I didn’t know this group didn’t have Korean members anymore when I heard this song for the first time, yet these girls are amazing and their Korean easy to understand. Their voices also fit very well together and this song was just perfect to show their talent to me. I love the song and the whole concept used on the mv, it was nice to see their hired a local director to work with and create this beautiful visual. I can’t wait to see more of Black Swan and the following surprises they will bring up🥰

I ❤ This song.........🔥
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHOOTING THIS VIDEO IN ODISSA, which is also the native state of member Sriya. Thank you for showcasing what a majestic beauty our native land is as even Indians are ignorant of it, thinking of it as being a backward and poor region when our Odissa boasts of such cultural magnificence. I loved the outfits, the beautiful cinematography and ofc our classical dance form Odissi being featured. Kudos to the directorial team!!
Very beautiful song 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
extremely good woww
Beautiful angel s😮😮😮 we love you ❤❤❤
OMG?

블랙스완 카르마 아주 아주 좋아요,,,,,,
I'm really happy for them. They've worked hard for this comeback and it's so unique, beautiful, and culturally appreciative.
Lumina did you see their performance on Show! Music Core today? 🤩 It was the album cover dresses so my guess about the tutus was wrong. Maybe tomorrow when they return to Inkigayo?
Proud! Thanks Black Swan

Just within 7 days Blackswan suppress 2.6m views and X:in have 2.4m views within 1 month😢
Song, choreography, vocals are amazing
Beautiful song
방금 음중 듣(?)다가 안경끼고 보니 멤버 구성이 넘나 놀라워서 여기까지 흘러들어왔네요. 뮤비도 분위기 있게 잘 뽑혔는데 무대하는 모습이 너무 포스있고 시원시원 멋졌어요! 언니~~~ 하고 싶은 그런 너낌!! 응원할게요!!!!!
Lumina DO NOT use replay button. YouTube counts that as spam and delete the views. When the video finishes watch at least 2 other videos THEN comeback to Karma
This is the best line-up! Blackswan can succeed if they finalize their line-up of members!!
3M let's go
32k to reach 2.7M
LETS GO 3M VIEWS LUMINA !!! 🫶🏽🫶🏽

The monument that the music video was shot in is known as Dhauli Shanti Stupa which lies to the south of Bhubaneswar, capital city of Odisha. Now some interesting facts about it...  In the year 272 B.C. the great Maurya dynasty's legendary king "Ashoka the Great" looked down from over the vast expanse of the battle field of Kalinga (now the area around Dhauli) littered with bodies after a fierce battle. Even after a well-fought victory, the sight of the aftermath of the war, death and destruction horrified him and resulted in Ashoka's transformation. He became a Buddhist and started following Buddha’s teachings and austere ways of leading life.
Not gonna lie song is really awesome  Lyrics 100% Vocal 100%  Rap 1000%  Dance 100%  Visuals10000000000%
Baru tahu para personelnya beda negara semua ada dari india, senegal,brazil dan amerika masuk ke ranah musik k pop tapi keren banget sukses selalu untuk fatou sriya nVee dan gabi Mvnya ada unsur budaya hindustan  💖💖💖💖💖💖👍👍👍👍👍👍

YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME! I LOVE THE REFERENCES TO INDIAN CULTURE! THANK U FOR APPRECIATING OUR CULTURE!
Oh...god it's unbelievable that the place is my Dhauligiri🖤🦢
Wow the music Vedio and song is so beautiful... I like the way this Song is Shot... 💗
이미 다국적, 다인종 컨셉도 파격적인데 노래 한 곡에 너무 많은 것을 보여주려 하는 것 같아서 진짜 포인트를 못 찾겠네요 제목부터 불교 용어라 그런건지 처음부터 인도 시장을 겨냥한거라면 모르겠지만 한국어 노래에 인도풍 의상과 배경에 진짜 의도를 모르겠네요. 차라리 인도어나 영어를 더 많이 사용해서 확실히 인도 시장이나 세계 시장을 노리던가.. 어차피 개인적인 평가일뿐 앞으로의 대중들 반응을 보면 알게 되겠지요. 색다른 출발선에서 앞으로의 성장을 더욱 기대하며 당신들을 응원합니다.
Will Taylor swift fans come here .Since the name are both the same.😂😂
The outfits are awesome , choreography,vocal, visual and mv : BLAST💣💣
Fandom Taylor swift akankah bnyak yg nyasar kemari karna nyari lagu karma?
বাংলাদেশিরা তুমরা এই কেপপ থেকে ফিরে আসো ইসলাম এ গান হারাম।আর কেপপ অনেক খারাপ এটা তোমাকে জাহান্নামে নিয়ে যাবে।আল্লাহ কে ভয় কর😭😭😭আমি কেপপ ফেন ছিলাম যখন আমি বোঝলাম তখন গান ছেড়ে দিলাম এখন আমার দায়িত্ব তোমাদের কেউ এই জাহান্নামের পথ থেকে বাচানো🙏🙏😭 ফিরে এসো মুসলমান ভাই বোনেরা❤

I think collab of different culture in kpop is actually promoting Korean language and it's beautiful culture in different and of course in good way. There is no need of awkwardness as there are no korean born artist in this band. These talented girls represented Korean culture very beautifully in Indian theme in this song. I really appreciate learning Korean language and their singing .Their efforts and the results are outstanding.I loved everything about this song❤❤.all the best
Ou o youtube travou ou lumina cansou kkkkkkkkkk acho que pra primeira semana ficamos nos 2.7, vamos continuar assistindo

oi gente, sou novo aqui!
I genuinely think that this is the best song that the company has produced in a long time. Its catchy, its fun, and the girls can sing. Fatou’s rap style and power shines so much here as well. I’m also impressed that the MV generated nearly 3 million views in a week! I hope they continue to get better!

Lots of love from indian❤❤❤❤❤
Me encantó la canción, muy pegadiza, el MV y su concepto es muy llamativo y algo diferente. Les deseo mucho éxito!
Can someone please submit the lyrics with English translation. Thank you  ❤ Trinidad 🇹🇹
I'm about to cry...I love how my girls are making it l. They deserve it
It is a temple from odisha it is Dhaulagiri I am really happy😍🥰
This comeback is actually receiving so much attention and this is such a good lineup…I hope their company takes this chance to push them properly with maybe some Korean game shows and interviews
I'm not a fan of BS, but I actually like this lineup. DR should stop trying to promote them as a KPOP group. DR should make them a global group since their fandom exists outside of Korea. They have the potential to do and be more. They're trying too hard to infiltrate an already oversaturated market, and let's be honest, one that doesn't want them. It's a waste of their time and talent.
3 M LETS GOOOOOOO❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
QUEEN OF VOCAL ~NVEE QUEEN OF RAPPING ~FATOU QUEEN OF VISUAL ~GABI QUEEN OF DANCES ~SRIYA QUEENS OF TALENT ~BLACKSWAN

Nvee!
Blackswan is the revolution!
Why is the mv stuck at 2.5 million views??? Come on, YouTube. Don't screw BlackSwan over by stunting their views. This already happened with another Idol whose views have been stunted at 2 million views, despite it being streamed daily, over a year, by millions of fans.
2.6M go
Yaay milloin views I'M SO HAPPY
Im confused... i thought people hated them for bad music...
Most Indians are not aware,if majority will this will be one of the top streamed song 😊.Just like we Indians make T-Series world wide following.😅
차라리 이렇게 다국적 그룹으로 갔어야 이제야 뭔가 그룹색깔을 찾은느낌 각 맴버간에 밸런스도 너무 좋고 뮤비도 색감 너무 이쁘게 잘나옴
My gwad❤😭

And remember there are always people rooting for you. Fighting!! ✊✊

2.5 MILLION!
Fabulous
Admittedly i'm new here this was very pretty though I have heard about them but never seen anything for them wasn't so I haven't heard them. But they were starting to pop off on TikTok a figured. I would check them out see what the hype was about. I'm not disappointed at all for the veterans here. What should I listen to? What do I need to know?
I didn't expect this to be so good, got shivers !
Wow!!❤
still stream :p
I think maybe they should have presented india more beautifully........they are many beautiful places across the india..
STREAM THIS SONG OMG IS SO GOODDDD
Blackswan YOU GO QUEENS!!!
gabi ❤️
디알뮤직은... 만드는 걸그룹마다 전부 제 스타일이에오.,,,,. 제가 태어나기 전인 베복부터 라니아 블스까지 다 조아요,,, 멤버 교체도 많앗지만 어케 이렇게 다들 짱짱걸들만 데랴오시는지...
This is so good !!!!
응원할게요🎉❤
Why they are all show so much old india. India really developed ahh I have no words for this 😞
I love how their subs are increasing constantly!!♡ KEEP GOING GIRLS THE SUCCESS IS WAITING FOR YOU!!!!!
Goooooooo girlllllllllllllllll
It's so unique how they mixed Indian with Korean. They really deserves more. Let's go support and love them more and more and make them the highest 💙💙
Just great 👍 I wish this gg becomes a very popular group 🎉
Guys please share how to stream in YouTube
Powerful
Such a amazing song. Love it❤
I came for sriya
Love from Odisha, India 🇮🇳
Black Swan really said "We see all of the mocking of Indian cultures the Kpop industry loves to do and we're here to show you appreciation instead" also is great for Sriya to show off 🥰
They literally showed the beauty of india
thankyou k-pop for showing my odisha nd some cultural thing in ur video...lots of love frm odisha❤
woah I can definitely see the prutatata sound and dance part going viral.
다들 이쁘고 노래도 좋고 타국에서 고생도 많으시니 대박나세요~~❤
Great to see some recognition to Odisha.. ✨
Keep it up blackswan 🙌🏼🎶🌺
Guys THIS SONG AUDIO IS TRENDING ON insta..it's 258 vid right now LET'S atleast make 500 reels!! It was our goal for first week!♡
好听！！！
Omg i love it, They deserve all the support. They show that music has no nationality ❤❤❤❤❤❤
These girl are talented. I think it would be perfect if the song is in English, instead of Korean...
I stan damn
Indian people generally don't accept the talent untill unless they make a video based on india and hindu concepts .......as a kpop stan since 2013 I know kpop music's potential and their artists ❤️
Good 💞 from Japan🇯🇵
Go 3 mn
I would appreciate some subtitles. It's hard watch the video and check the lyrics elsewhere.
The new vibe that i need
Everyone says that 4 members group is always perfect and i felt that after watching this MV
Let's reach 700k by the end of this month

🥴🤢
Странная группа (не эстетичная) так бы сказала, не понимаю её создания. Какая цель и для чего? Я не считаю, что это кпоп группа чисто потому что на корейском поют. Распадется рано или поздно...
The only thing I wished they could add more places like there are many beautiful places in india if u know what I mean there could be many shots with many different  places because the scenes looked so beautiful in the mv .  This was a beautiful mv and art and culture was beautifully represented colorful
wow this song is shooted in odisha in india right ?
😂😂😂

the song is so good and i am so happy that it showcases indian culture so well

Arrasaram muito! Não tinha esperanças pra esse grupo. Porém vocês superaram minhas expectativas ❤ Parabéns  화이팅
MDS EU AMEI
Blackswan é um projeto que falhou miseravelmente, mas as meninas são super talentosas, elas não deveriam estar nessa indústria horrível, acho q as meninas do blackswan merecem coisas melhores, elas poderiam simplesmente tentar uma carreira fora da coreia, sem ser kpop, o talento de cada uma não tá escrito, na minha opinião, as meninas poderiam sair desta indústria e tentar uma carreira aqui na América, como um grupo, elas são talentosas d+ para o kpop.
Road to 3M!
Me encanta ❤❤❤
Let's whip out our Abacus and do the math: One 1st Worlder + Three 3rd Worlders = Destined to end with xtra thirst and a dangerous amount of envy.
streaming 🤞
you are doing amazing!!!
love you girls!!
"i don't think so!!" omg this line doesn't get out of my head
The representation 😮😮😮😮❤
Woww
멋 있다
Bora gente precisamos alcançar os 3M de views

MASTERPIECE
Oooh weeeee

오 ... 너무 좋아요. 뮤직비디오 보고 탈퇴한 맴버들 후회할 듯. 한국인 없으면 어때, 듣고 좋으면 다 k-pop
CARAAAA BLACKSWAN VCS MELHORAM MUITO NESSE MV NA REAL NEM SÃO VCS MAIS A DE MUSIC SE VCS CONTINUAREM NESSA VIBE VAI FZR SUCESSO!

뭐지 이 좋음은??
Guys, Blackswan is on Music Core lineup, they're gonna perform May 27th! It'll be on MBC Kpop at 3.20pm Kst!! BUT ALSO AT INKIGAYO THE 28TH AT 3.28PM KST!!! (Schedule is full lol)
Uuuuu Weeeee That Karma!
OHHHHHH MY GOSHHHHH WHAT WAS THIS??????AAAAAAA I LOVE THIS SONGGGG
노래 너무 좋고 안무 멋있고 소름 ㄷㄷㄷ
Fatou low key one of the top rappers in k-pop, why people sleepin' on her? she got flow and she fierce🔥  this one's a bop
❤❤❤
A Léia simplesmente sumiu, tenho quase certeza que saiu do grupo
Vcs deram um grande passo a frente com as visualizações
this is such a nice concept, love that they've incorporated indian culture so much. the outfits just don't hit tho, they feel like missed opportunities. they'd have been stunning in lehengas instead of those lowkey cruel aunt vibes a-line sequin dresses. their visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the concept and the editing and everything, but the clothes don't do them justice. also those holo tights pls i'm crying- they ruin their otherwise perfectly nice outfits.
Such a satisfying song.
다마스태.
All I want is truth, stop the play, hey hey heyyyy (⁠♡⁠ω⁠♡⁠ ⁠)⁠ ⁠~⁠♪
홀리쉿 멋있는데..!
i am new fan  also i am already in love with fatou parts of the song 💚✨️ they are all talented 💪 keep going
Einfach geil❤😊
Me still waiting for DR Music to put subtitles on the video lol
Go girls
you all are so perfect 🫶💚✨️ voice , talent,  beauty , dance  and style
DO NOT CHANGE THESE MEMBERS THEY ARE PERFECT!!!!! I hope I'm not being rude but this is their BEST sounding song from the inception of the group and Fatu? Guuuuurl sounds even more amazing, they finally found a sound that fits her and these new members? Sounds so much better than the previous * no offense, in my opinion * but it's true. This song is fire!!!!!! Ta ta taa
This is a really good song ! Let's all support Blackswan
str34m on (s)(p)(o)(t)(i)(f)(y) we only have 88k monthly listeners on there !!

この子達どこの子〜？見たことないタイプのグループでかっこいい✨韓国語かな
2,3 Mio within two days...just wow!
I'm always interested in all your MV's it's really cool
Everyone saying raising awareness about the cultural appropriation is "helping the algorithm " to them I have to say that you are cowards who will sell your own mothers for western/korean validation. You all are always showcasing your slave mentality
블랙스완 흥해라~~~!
Loved fatou's deep voice 😍 keep going girls 👧 👏
Super duper happy ro so them in odisha ❤❤❤😂🎉
Love this so much
Everyone saying this is cultural appreciation tell me this-  Can Sriya say the n word?  Can Gabi say the n word? Can Sriya and Gabi wear dreaddlocks in their hair and dance in African jungles????   So that proves culture cannot bw transfered just because you're in a group.  Hence this is pure cultural appropriation
Indian kpop fans should be educated enough by now to realise that cultural appropriation is never OKAY. STOP this company now because no one knows what they will show tomorrow? They can disrespect hindu gods tomorrow and you all will clap and say it is cultural appreciation ? Don't give them an inch.  Learn from black people and how they protect their culture. Grow a spine
After watching this video I forget BTS and blackpink who too 😊😊 actually I'm not army or bling 😂😂😂  actually not only blackpink or BTS i forget whole  k-pop  ❤ beasece I'm love blackswan now ❤❤
Wow
I am on my knees begging the Indian fans to not support such cultural appropriation and exploitation.  If Sriya is Indian then she can wear whatever she wants but the other have NO RIGHT. Gabi, Fatou are not Indian this is NOT their culture.
Lot's of love ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ black swan
Cakep❤
Se siente diferente, se siente la calidad, el presupuesto, un gran cambio. Sign así
Sriya dancenya keren banget, Fatou rapnya bagus, NVee vokalnya gak usah ditanya deh, terus Gabi cantik banget ihiy lagunya juga enak. Keren 👍

Indians here don't even realise a korean company is once again appropriating their culture...sriya is Indian she can be dressed however she wants. But rest all are neither Indian nor hindu so why are they dressed with those accessories? It is blatant racism and prejudice against Indian culture.  Stop supporting this nonsense Luminas and call them out!! It is not acceptance
2.4 MILLION, 660K SUBS SOON!!
Blackswan ❤️❤️
So much cultural appropriation....and such a ghetto music video.
Beauty
A TRUE HIT!!!!! On repeat!!!
They are beautiful! 🥰 But of all the group names why did they decide to name their group into BLACKSWAN? 🤔 It is similiar to BLACKPINK. 🥴 I'm just wondering. Don't hate me 😇
Indian culture❤
Intrumen peratama saat musik diputur , dari negara mana?
this made appreciate the beauty of India so much. In fact, besides the vibrant colors and scenery, I cant help overplaying the parts with the Indian women in these segments: 1:42 - seeing her made me want to imitate her and vibe to the rap too ! also she's very pretty ! 1:56 - adorable girl  2:41 - The synchronization of the movement with the melody is just so satisfying
This location in bangladesh or india?
좋아요❤😊😊😊😊
Beautiful!!
Они все такие необычные красотки❤
❤❤❤I always love them to the core but the fact it's that they're slowly breaking the racial culture
essa musica completamente viciante

Blackswan showed the path that kpop can include different culture outside South Korea. Hope big companies will follow this path to make kpop truly international. Wish Blackswan members, who embraced Korean culture, great success in future. ❤

I am addicted to this song..  Bridge part , sriya's dance, Gabi's prechorus slayed♥♥♥
As meninas peogrediram muito vocalmente, a formação está incrível mas sinto falta da leia no grupo, não somente da leia mais sim da antiga formação. Ser um lumina significa  não poder se acostumar com a formação, pois,  pode mudar a qualquer momento.

PURE PERFECTIONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Let's reach 10mil!!!
Wow ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Sarangahe unnies , keep going fighting 🎉
Keren bggtt... korea rasa india 👏👏👏
everything about this comeback is so perfect i cant get over it, the title track and bside are both addictive, choreo is extremely catchy and impactful, the STYLING omg. im so obsessed with the extravagance of all the different outfits and the way they seamlessly incorporated traditional indian jewelry and fabrics in a modern and hip way.. i said it before on twitter but the hair colors corresponding to each members skin tone was such a perfect styling choice it gives a nude and light/summery feeling to outfits that otherwise could have easily come across as heavy, the lighting and shooting locations are so beautiful and emphasize each members charms so well. i love the direction of this mv as well, the shots are so cinematic and the transitions are so fun, the whole concept is unique and fresh while perfectly matching the group energy. im so excited to see how this lineup grows over time, blackswan fighting!!! lumina loves uuuu
почему они являются кпоп группой, если они даже не корейцы💀 почему бы им не стать обычной поп группой, хз максимально странно
Already watched more then 100 times

기획사 관계자가 보신다면~  영어로된 버전도 발표하세요  한국어로된거면 케이팝 매니아들만 듣습니다  많은 사람들이 못듣습니다  피프티피프티처럼 한국어와 영어 두가지 버젼 내놓으면 잘될거라 생각됩니다
Truely sooooo so good 😊 keep up the good work

Estava anciosa para a volta delas<3
와우 사랑해요 사랑해요
Love from Odisha 🎉❤
Odisha is the land of Buddha where Buddhism flourished for centuries. Odisha was the sacred land to host Buddha holy hair relic until the land was gone to nonBuddhist rulers and that beautiful ancient history buried under the ground. Even today, the famous Buddhist universities like Lalitagiri, Ratnagiri and Udaygiri still witness the great influence of Buddhism. Buddhist monks from China and other kingdoms visited Odisha and studied in Buddhist universities. Thank you  Blackswan and Sriya Lenka for showing that lost history of Buddhism through the Shanti stupa and also showing the vivid culture of India.
Did the bully leave?
Proud Odia ❤❤❤❤
Every part is so satisfying :3 They executed it so well
I wonder what is considered kpop now
Nice Combination of Cultures.....
O que aconteceu com a Leia?😢

I just want to know ..black swan have Anti fans there and get Super racist comments from Korean people itself ? Like we know How Lisa Blackpink get the hate and super racist comment ..even Lisa is look Korea she got racist ..than I'm wonder how bout Black swan , all them 4 are not Korean and have different skin tone too especially they have dark n black skin ..so the question back is BLACK SWAN GET RACIST COMMENTS FROM KOREAN PEOPLE ITSELF ???
Wow all shots at Odisha ❤

As a Korean guy, I seriously wanna say that Blackswan deserves big praise for this comeback.  "Karma" is especially amazing to me because it dramatically proves that unique Indian cultural background can be perfectly mingled with Kpop vibes. 😊😊 Good job, and I am proud of you 4 guys ❤❤

We have to give at least 10 million views to this mv for their hard work . So fighting luminas Slow and steady wins the race. Fighting
BLACKSWAN is competing in K pop battle field in Korea.  Their new video and song , Karma is so interesting.  Especially, Sriya is from  Odisha, in 🇮🇳.  I'll support her team. India is in my mind forever.
PLEASE. THIS IS SO AMAZING!
We are so proud of you sriya🥲...proud how this song has indian concept ♥♥♥Love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳

S34am
If a non - kpop person see it they will for sure never gonna believe that it is a Korean group
Is it just me? Or they look perfect now as a 4 foreign member group? Hopefully their company makes them 4 as permanent members of the group. 😊
So proud to be an Odia❤ Seeing that the whole song was shot in Odisha😍
One word, beautiful. The dress is beautiful, the place is beautiful. The song, okay la, not bad.

Now this is culture appreciation. I loved the song and their voices, vocals and dance everything was on fire. Fatou raps give me goosebumps everytime. Nvee and gabi's vocal are so angelic. And sriya's dance break is firee.
Is it me only who can see that this video is really cheap quality?
Woah, the rap part was a killer!
Honestly the first thing that caught my eye when the video started was Fatou. She is stunning 😮❤
Soooooo nice 🥰 songs
2M is done Lumina! Let's go 3M in 7 days! (1week).

Love the cultural appreciation in this video. I've liked former blackswan songs but haven't really vibed to them, but this song has me on a chockhold its on repeat on spotify. This comeback is insane and I've been binge watching all their music shows and tiktok posts. Cat and mouse also gives me cupid vibes, it's so soothing. This mv is beautifully colourful and the production is 😘😍. I'm definitely a stan now, a Lumina 😊
THE TRANSITION HELLO? 1:38
😳😳
We are on our way to 2.2M, that's really good!
Everyday I wake up and I start the day by saying "I see the light!" Lmao
Cara, eu amei isso ❤
BRRR TA TA TA
I am not their fan but I am in love with this song especially the girl rap parts
This group deserves more views and supports because they all are talented and outstanding members..... They deserve our love ❤️
Can't help but to notice the outfit concept like nmixx,( this part!!! 1:39 -2:30 ) but the music is really a masterpiece! This is my 1st time listening to them actually!
They represent the history of korea and indian history proud of them.

love love the fact that Black Swan members are foreigners. so guys, you are already displaying cultural diversity in the K-pop industry which simply means who aint limited to just K-pop culture. This is Indian and I love it. just do more. explore different cultures and trust me people with appreciate you guys more.
I FUCKING LOVE THIS , THIS IS GREAT I LOVE IT SM I WISH IT WAS LONGER YALL ARE THE BEST KEEP UP THE GOOD WORD😭🇯🇲🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
Omg este mv es una locura que bello todos los paisajes TT
There are so many nice reaction videos! Really loving that for our Swans. 🥰
노래는 괜찮으니까 이제 마살라 리믹스를 내던지 매쉬업해서 숏폼으로 마케팅하고 애들 악세서리에 인도 악세서리도 추가하자... 인도 악세서리도 찾아보니까 간지나는거 많더라.. 그리고 가비 머리색 백금발 예쁜데 개성없어보여.. 차라리 스리야를 백금발하고 가비나 파투를 빨갛게해.. 그러고 블랙스완엔 인어공주 존똑인 멤버가 있다고 마케팅하면 돼잖아 ㅠㅠㅠㅜㅠ 라니아 닥터필굿때 감 되찾아와 제발 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Im obessed  to listen this song waoaaoa
That karma

무대의상 보고 한숨나와서 댓달러옴.. 소속사야 무대의상 검정 레자랑 색색깔상의에 핑크 뿡뿡이바지가 최선이였니ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 걍 이 뮤비 의상 리폼해서 입혀서 무대 시켜라 아님 이태원가서 인도의상 사다가 입히던가 ㅠㅠㅠ노래도 컨셉이 인도면 인도악기라도 좀 집어넣던가 아님 댄브를 리사처럼 완전히 에스닉하게 만들어서 틱톡챌린지라도 유행시키던가 할 수 있는데 왜 이렇게 감을 못잡아 진짜ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 속터져 진짜 20년전 샤키라나 이정현 의상이랑 뮤비라도 보고와 ㅠㅠㅠ 스리야라는 치트키가 있는데 뭐하는거야 ㅜㅜㅠ

Let talent shine not popularity. Black swan are GOOD
Those girls deserve to be recognized
Someone said it's serelanka
Wow! I love the way they put other cultures in the MV . So different
2 million 🔜
989
I loved this, everything about it and I appreciate how many cultures are within this music video from the sitting to language to the different nationality of women. I also think its a new direction ( which not everyone will like ) but a chance they have taken and proved how well it can work. My only constructive criticism (no hate) is please please please get then a hair stylist who can deal with their different hair textures) this may very well mean one for each) im sure this is just a learning curb hut i hope it gets addressed
This video has made history for me, I honestly can't believe how far they are now and I hope I can continue seeing them growing. Hopefully we won't have to wait this long for a comeback though I was starting to lose hope, deffo worth the wait though 😊
They caught me off guard with their music LIKE DAMNNNNNNNN I LOVE THIS
i'm sharing this with my friends. this turned out stellar!
Oh my god let's reach 2 million
this is fantastic!!!
they are rapidly improving and it is sooo proud of a moment to witnesssss letsssgoooo

It's Really Good to like Try new things..The song is nice our girls are talented but I didn't like the concept shooting infront of the auto,Shop and Betal nut trees it kinda looks like someone from India did a cover video of k-pop song.. Don't hate me for saying this i just said what i felt maybe they should have choose some more good shooting scenes.
Best song ever & Best Group ever
I love this!  As a mixed Korean, I'm so happy to see more diversity in Kpop.  All of these girls are so pretty and talented.  The song slaps and I love the concept of the video.  I hope they get big!  I'm a new fan <3
QUEENS IN MY HEART..

Beautifully presented. Amazing song with excellent locations. Love from ODISHA❤
Why the mv is giving me  advertisement for clothing brand vibzz😂 But in the sum of all the song is bop❤
Is this odisha
Hana dul set come come around. Is quite addictive
Its great the MV is getting a lot of support but the album sales are currently less than 30 (@koreansales posted before deleting), they need more sales

I'm From Odisha's Bhubaneswar And This Music Video Is Shoot In Bhubaneswar  I'm So Happy 🥰💙🙏🏻🙏🏻 Lots Of Love From Bhubaneswar 💜💙🙏🏻🥰 Let's Support Our 4 Queens 👑😇
Amazing 🎉🎉🎉
Eu não canso de ver, sincronia perfeita  Fatou entregou tudo no rap incrível 🎉❤ Gabi e Nvee com voz de anjo🥰😍 A Syria arrasou no dance break e no vocal tbm ❤🎉 O clipe por mais simples que ficou ele foi muito bem editado souberem usar muito bem os cenários  E pros haters que atacaram elas só esqueceram de uma coisa: O nome da música se chama Karma😘🖤🦢
WHATTTTT 😲😮😱
lets stream until we reach 10Mil so they could do the bungee jumping challenge
A "kpop" group with no Korean members 👁️👄👁️ Only supported by non-Korean Koreabos who are so desperate to see themselves represented in a country they fetishize and romanticize because they only know what they see on kdramas. So many talented Koreans train for YEARS to debut in a group and yet this opportunity is given to foreigners who were put together simply because they are foreigners. This is nothing more than a token mix-race group. I've no problem with foreigners in kpop, but they should not be debuted simply because they are foreigners and they should not be taking away opportunities from actual Koreans who speak the language natively. Really hope k-netz will do their thing and dismantle this garbage.
❤❤❤❤❤😊
뭐야 한국어 왜케 찰지게 잘함 ㅋㅋ 노래 중독성 쩌네요 ㅠㅠ 비트 개좋아..
Nvee's vocals<<333333
Fatou a dit que sa perruque s’était déplacée dans clip et que l’on peu le voir. Du coup me revoilà 😂😂
Almost to 2mill

Fatou maravilhosa ❤
lol wtf this so clear that they just want to use indian fans to make their group famous, they know indian fans always support their countrys people so they made the music video and everything to do with india . ( im desi btw) and yet they dont accept the skin colour of the foreign members , look at their faces and makeup , its so whitewashed .
Вы супер 🎉🎉🎉
Totally loved it ❤❤❤❤
This deserves sooo much more recognition! Such a bop<3

i I love blackswan🤍🖤🖤
❤❤❤ no toxicity and no sympathy type lyrics like boys did bad blah blah u r strong girl go go because this is the only type release in Korea show girl boss that’s it. Finally something better we have. But hard part is that they get only this much views, I think if they release English version that will be much more hit.
Wow 😳❤❤
Gabi looks like an AI
SRIYA IS A FORCED TO BE RECKONED WITH 😱😱😱
I don't under such music
I saw here Bengali bride and the school uniforms of West Bengal

I remember this group has Korean members right? did they leave the group?
Officially addicted couldnt stop thinking bout it at school
VAOVVVV SUPPERR
Omg it's sooo addicting!!!! The beat's are just..... Wow!!!!
Visual luar biasa, konsep yang keren dan termasuk langka, vocal ga main main, ini udah bagus banget sih ♥️♥️
Jujur kasian sama Youngheun dan Judy, dipaksa keluar berkedok "graduate" biar grupnya dikenal dengan "Grup yang membernya dari berbagai negara". Padahal kan bisa tanpa "mengeluarkan" mereka, bisa tetep promosi ot6/7
What's the name of that girl with blonde hair
No wonder why they have never seem to fit into anything 😂
Wow let's do it 2 million in 3 days
Addicted to this song yrr
❤🤍
This is a unique k pop group with unique members...every members are really talented n georgious...but Fotou's rap is another level yrr
I dont even stan blackswan but this song is hella goodddd
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
❤
I am from odisha

Song is euphoric 🤯 and perfect like it was meant to be! Btw my first time here
Woow
Oh wow!! Beautiful video! ♥️
SO BOOTIFULL SRIYA YOU ARE THE STUDENT OF PULIN SIR RIGHT?
hepiniz çok güzel olmuşsunuz😍
A big thanks to showing Odisha and Odia culture. India's best kept secret.
No one talking about that this was shot in Odisha.    And I am from odisha
Nae glad to see them on my explore page again
Такая необычная и прекрасная группа...
Almost at 2M, everyone is doing a great job, we're on our way to 1.9M!!!
Listening 5 times a day from the day of release
Yay.. I can see more flesh, blushie healthy figures and colours. Don't get even skinnier Okay..BE a REAL role model for those younger people.
😮😮😮 wow... Que hermosas  ❤️ que impresionante rap❤Y es hermosa 😮 wow 😲
Thank you Black Swan for represents our India 💜. They show our Culture and India and Odisha's beauty 🎆.
This is so underrated 😢
Great song ❤❤ Sure You will make it to the top 🎉🎉🎉 No doubt
Fatou your rapp is cool 😁 Nvee your so cute 😳 Sriya your dance stunning 🤩 Gabi your voice amazing 😍
Let's go 10M
This came up as a recommendation and I clicked cz of the 🇮🇳 visuals bcz I was curious... Heard of the band but not their songs. I think if Blackswan embraces their diverse heritage and does more Indian/afro beat inspired songs and promotes in those countries... Even using languages from those countries, they may do well. Embrace your diversity and make it your strength
This is soo good
2k more view to 1.8mil, lets stream  Views count towrds their win
It giving high school old fashion clothes
Guys lets make 5M in 1 week
that karma!!!
1 million views only in 3 days😯 Keep going girls!! We'll support you❤
So Dope!!! Unlike the other kpop songs Very Catchy and unique. Love it.
Is this Kpop?
Vote for them live
HONEST REVIEW The music is a bop. I cant stop replaying the chorus. The melody and the choreography is stuck in my head. the reference is pretty, since karma is a sanskrit word. But as sanskrit's origin is from Indo-Aaryn (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka ) it would have been better to represent other countries as well. I feel proud to see many people actively working in the korean industries despite their nationality.
I LIKE THIS SONG
МОИ ТАЛАНТЛИВЫЕ ДЕВОЧКИ
Let gooo we are to close
Congratulations 🎉...The place is in  Bhubaneswar capital of odisha state Of India 🇮🇳 ...I'm proud to belong from odisha...thanks again kpop group wishes best of luck for grand success 🎉🎉🎉

Wtf lol.  Also, what happened to the other girls????? Istfg there’s a curse with this group lmao. Idk why you’d wanna be associated with a group that has had changes to the group more than you’ve ever blinked in your life.
Jay Jagannath! Proud to see My Odisha,Odia Language,Culture and our dance form Odishi!♥️
Gabi looking so stunning 💕💕💕 proud to be India
this is such a good song.....
❤
Proud of u Shreya for representing our odisha ❤😊To all over the world 🌎
From odisha Bhubaneswar... can't beleive 💫😍
Why it's looking like Pakistani clothes brands add ☠️
Song is lit but ....... I do have 'but' with whitewashing for visual and it's good that u r showing India culture butt feel like using it for publicty .....just my simple opinion don't want to hurt anyone.... No hatrate do agree that song and dance was awesome, even liked ur concept too waiting for new song 🙂
That was a slay by each and every member. Definitely a SLAY!!!!!!!❤❤
okay i didn't expect it to go that hard damn!
The video was awesome and I am so proud of you sriya because of you we a second Indian k pop girl and all Indian fan will love you soon ❤
Sigo a BS desde hace un tiempo y me sorprende que sin tener miembros coreanas actuales sigan cantando en coreano,creo que con esto que nos han dado deberian de girar sus conceptos a otro lado del mundo,  presiento o que les iría mejor porque talento hay,falta más visión.
Wow, this is addicting!!!!! Loved it so much ❤❤❤❤
ayoo😮❤
was not expecting this to be this good but blackswan slayed!!
INDIA❤
ODISHA ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i think  Close To Me and Karma is the best=))) but many people dont know BlackSwan then view MV not high....
This is the first time kpop doing this great.... Really appreciate them appreciating hindu culture.... Shriya lenka you queen.
Wow 😮 hole video shoot in our ODISHA 🎉 am proud of it❤
love it ❤️
I am ARMY but still here because of being Indian Thankyou blackswan for choosing our country
Wow, they got so much better! Major improvement in the mixing/production department of the song. Stunning vocals - Fatou blew me away. So much power in her voice ❤
Did they get new members?
2M. LETS GO ❤❤❤❤🔥🔥
아주 잘하는   K팝 가수네요 좋아요

Sliving 100% Love it the most xoxo
Nice
Lots of love from odisha (India)❤️ 🇮🇳
Are they changing their team members? Cos i tought they would be 3 korean and 1 non korean member in this group?
0:45 jisoo?
This is not kpop, they are not Korean, Black swan is a song from the group "Rainbow", what's the point of this?
Omg this song is so addictive and the visuals are stunning!! I wish nothing but success to these girls, hope DR keeps this lineup once and for all 😭
I cannot explain how good this song and MV is .....they depected the colourful as it is  with no sugarcoating...I love you black swan and forever
My girls have haters already 😂
damn...
I love when people become famouse because of their talent more than anything Respect
❤
BRO THAT SO AMAZING FIRST TIME HEAR A INDIAN CULTURE KPOP SONG  I AM FROM MULTI FANDOM BUT AFTER HEARING THIS SONG I AM A FAN OF BLACKSWAN I HEARD LOTS OF KPOP SONGS FROM FAMOUSE GROUPS LIKE TWICE EXO BLACKPINK AND MORE BUT THIS IS A MASTER PICE LOVE FROM BANGLADESH AND I HOPE I WILL ENTERD KPOP ONE DAY
Они мне в некоторых моментах напоминают kda😳😳. Но я вообще не ожидала такого, кажется я новый стэн😊

한국어 가사 완전 잘 들리고 (장르로서)kpop이라는 느낌 확실한디? 그리고 중독성이 장난아냐브르르땃따따 혹시 한국 음방 일정도 도나?
This vibe when you love KPop but before you know KPop you very love with Bollywood. Fantastic!❤

Keren sih ini
Waaa they're beautiful 😍
They shooted this in odisha My birth place is in Odisha
I wasn't sure of the new members at first cause I did liked the former members. However, the new members prove me that they got what it takes. Really love the song and each and everyone of them are sooooo pretty. Really love the diversity they are thriving for even if it is not mainstream in Kpop/Korea idol groups yet. Keep it up BLACKSWAN! May their company continue to give them great promotions and songs.
so nobody is gonna talk about that little indian princess! she soo cute , and the dress amazin! :)
Love from India.....
This is shot in odisha ❤

I remember people were saying they had no vocalists after their Korean members left. Funny, all I hear are four vocalists.
Fact that Korean pop group Blackswan refined and refined each year so much until they finally got a group with no Korean member is quite shocking, sad and revolutionary... I really don't know how to feel... Keeping that aside the song sounds really nice
HOW MANY OF YOU CAN RELATE YOUR LOCALITY IN A KPOP M/V ?? bout me yep i can 😏
Made me speechless❤🎉
let's make it to two million in three days
I love itt
Damn... This song sounds great! 🔥🔥
fatou is on fire man🔥 🔥
Wait a minute, these are not the Blackswan that I know, only just one of them 😮

I loved, girls you are fabulous. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

I’m kind of glad they went in this direction as opposed to Kpop. I feel this is more their style. Well done ladies

🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Blackswan is FIRE
Yesss girls!!!!! this is it!
Что за жесть 👀 культурная апроприация во всей красе 😢
❤luv it 😘😘
The weird part is why outsiders choose those parts of India even though we indian know least.. but song is good
Talento elas têm de sobra o que falta mesmo é reconhecimento!
Nice 👍
Perhaps I’ll have to Stan now
3:00 A gabi ganhou a carreira dela nesse Hey Hey Hey
O próximo mv será gravado em Floripa?
Hii i am from odisha Jay jagannath
I think , I suggest they wear clothes from sherrihill, because they suit that style better, they deserve better than this❤❤❤
Las reinas estan de vuelta  ;)
Blackswan is perfect i love it ❤❤
They really appreciate the beauty of Indian culture… many other groups would simply use the aesthetic to capitalize off without the intent to closely learn and educate themselves on it’s unique traditions and I corporate it as backgrounds and outfits… love how this MV incorporates authentic and untouched Indian culture
This song is unique in kpop world.
Wait am i actually liking a black swan song😨😨
Let's 2M go
Wow...temazooo chicass...😗😘
Wow..love you..girls...buen temaaa fighting?!!🇦🇷😇🤗😍

Loved the video, great work Black Swan. Something i noticed at 1:36 when Fatou's rap -look at all the extras and tell me what you notice??? Was this meant to highlight or they thought it was appropriate for the aesthestic. Really curious

Вау, не стэню эту группу, но песня интересная и костюмы необычные, очень не превычно в кей попе видеть Индию. Спасибо за вашу работу, очень оркий и не привычный клип😊

A very strong comeback. The song is amazing and fun.  Fatou is stunning ❤ Fighting Blackswan
This part 3:59 🔥
Everyone did so well! Deffo adding to my Spotify playlist!
Sreya is not only making our Odisha proud but she is making our whole country proud!
THE VIEWS ARE GOING UP FASTER!!!
Ютуб решил, что это мне нужно было увидеть и я скажу ему спасибо за это.  Впервые вижу что-то такое, круто!
The majestic white building at 00:00:25 is Dhauligiri (Peace pagoda).  It commemorates the place where the great Kalinga war was fought in approx. 200 B.C between the Kalinga kingdom and the Mauryan emperor Ashoka the great.    Although, Asoka won the war, he was so filled with regret with the bloodshed of this war that he converted to Buddhism and this was one of the most consequential events in Indian history and perhaps World history.  Asoka had a long fruitful career ruling over the Mauryan kingdom (which covered almost the whole of present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc) for the next 40 years.  He sent Buddhist missionaries to almost every big kingdom and he is perhaps, the principal reason Buddhism spread out from India into China, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Tibet and other places in East Asia.
We may not be the biggest fandom but we Luminas are always going to support our girls
Fatou❤❤❤
Amoo

They are this up fr
I'm not a Blackswan fan but my daughter saw this video and was quite excited, she wanted to go to these temples next time we visited my in laws in India😊

Indiaaaaa let's blow this song up to the top to show everyone what India really is !!!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The track is so catchyyy
NO es apropiación cultural.  NO se creen coreanas.  ES talento y música.  El kpop es musica y la música esta hecha para disfrutar...no se debe poner limites de que genero musical debe cantar alguién dependiendo de su raza o nacionalidad,ójala lo entiendan,El kpop no es solo para coreanos por el simple hecho de ser de corea....
QUEENS. ♥
As an odia person,I don't even see representation of us in our own Indian entertainment industries, kudos to them for depicting odisha so beautifully ❤

NO KOREAN? THIS IS NOT A KPOP GROUP
The aesthetics🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻
Great to see Indians in kpop 👏 👍
😍😍😍😍😍😘😘💜💜💜🧿🧿
This has to be the best mv with no culture disrespect
You girls hit bullseye with this track..🎯  A  Treat to the eyes.. 🤩
Can we talk about how unique the group is?? There is no Korean member in the group. There are 4 members in the group. Fatuo is Senegalese she is the main rapper of this group, Sriya is Indian and she is the main dancer of this group, Gabi she is Brazilian she is the visual and nvee is American she is the best vocalist. Let's support them forever >3
700k sub vamos 🎉
I'll seriously support them , they're very talented
Kpop del futuroo 😊
This song doesn't get old, each time I watch it I focus on one member of BS then later on all of them, there is so much to it. Reactions are all over YT, so far, all positive. Time to put past controveries aside, BS needs to soar!
Wow this is awesome, I love how they represent India here, just the authentic Indian beauty
Odisha best ❤❤❤❤❤
I like the song soooo.... much ❤❤❤❤❤ all members all lokking so beautiful and looks like an angles👑👑 lots of love from India and make more songs     blackswan............ we are always with you ♥♥♥

I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
Literally obsessed with this song😩😩😩
SO SO PROUD OF THEM🩷🥹🩷🥹
wahhhh, where is Indonesia'n? wkwkwk, sesungguhnya tarian tradisional Indonesia jauh lebih banyak untuk bisa di eksplore dan di buat sebagus MV BlackSwan, tpi apa daya minim dukungan. Daebak sih BlackSwan, goodJob
i think they should private old videos with old members..i mean let them go.. now it’s time to focus to new team.. they deserved better!
The song should be in english ❤
Congrats for 1.5 million views! My fellow luminas can we get to 10 million for our blackswan girls?
Slayed thatt
Im in love with this song.
Dance is so cool Music is satisfied Love from India❣️💖  Like from odisha 😂😂
Thank you for appreciating our culture would like to see more diverse songs coz now days kpop was all about love,girl crush  concepts but now I finally m  breathin u guys..👏👏👏
Fabulous 👌🏻
Okay but this is a masterpiece! So glad to see blackswan thriving! 💫🫶🏼
Why every k-pop songs tune and all the things hear same
The hook is so catchy fatou's rap slaysssss she looks so sexy and the colors ❤❤❤❤
ORGANIC VIEWS YALL💅💅
I usually dont listen to blackswan but this song is so amazing, I should listen to them more.
kd a leia?
💞💞🎧🎧
❤😘🤩😍🫶
Cool love it❤
I just don’t understand why it has to be considered kpop or sung in Korean. English would be just fine 😂. This is why people don’t take these groups seriously. The overall song/beat sounds like a mock of kpop music, not meant to sound good but sound like kpop.
LEIA BETTER THAN THIS KOREABOOS😂🤣
Eu amo tanto essa introdução 🤌🤌🤌
You guys did an awesome job❤
The real beauty of odisha 😍❤️💫
So happy to see they shot the video in Odisha, Shreya Lenka so proud of you and yes video and song so awesome
Get out Fatou

As an Indian feel so proud 🙌🙌❣️ lots of love
wow I really like this song!!! black swan keep getting better and better!! also, I know they've gone through some member changes, so I'm just curious, are any of the members Korean? or are they all "foreign"? regardless, the song slaps
Beautiful!!!!!
I kinda felt like they were saying oh like c'mon .but it's really really good song let's go
It's shooting even in Odisha ,being in Odisha , proud for the girls😢 ..They nailed it ,🔥🔥
Best
I'm really shocked by this work. BlackSwan came back with everything and logically improved in all aspects

This is how you celebrate culture. The song is amazing so is the mv
Love this so much
Falta pouco pra chegamos em 2M pessoal. Lest go !!!!
I like the song, it comes out to be of a strong vibe..powerful song..ah but I don't like the concept of merging that setting in India..I mean yeah, the idea is pretty good..but I just don't find the way it came out to be fascinating. It could've been simpler.
Costumes could have been better, why so mediocre
블랙스완 사랑해요❤ 화이팅 🎉
that was a good one
Very interesting concept ❤
Ah me encanto omgg aqui una  ONCE APOYANDOLAS, TIENEN DEMASIADO TALENTO OMG LAS 4 SON MUY LINDAS❤

Son gooood ❤❤❤
2M coming soon
Vamos continuar gente, chegar aos 2M. Força
With BS is four princess come from four different continent, with different culture and tradition, that means open huge room for them, to explore, mixed and infuse various genre that vibes differently, that will bring them closer, reaching global stage.
As an netizen of odisha this is fire🔥
Add subtitles please
wow
Wow the cinematography the transitions the beautiful back drop off India. This is such a high quality music video that deserves more recognition
idk why some people are hating them i dont think that they have done anything wrong
Odisha 🥲
Elas seriam ainda maiores saíssem do limite kpop. Ficou perfeito!
I hope blackswan goes to each of their countries and shoots MV’s with a concept related to that country. 🔥 ❤🎉
Indian girl is not nice she is over acting
मुझे बहुत पसंद आया गाना 🇮🇳
Hope Leia isn't coming back.
Let goooooooooooo 2m now is 1.5 just 500k

I feel so proud of them for showcasing the authentic culture of India and even more happy for shooting such a beautiful mv in Odisha this place as alot to offer and is so neglected

Dhauligiri is near my house.. i mean you literally can see Dhauligiri's light show from our roof top and they shoot their MV there, I'm so proud of Sriya and the girls and their production team to film whole MV in India and show Odisha so well (i know it's so hard to represent whole country especially India in 1 MV which in only 3:41 mins time limit but hey.. they did great job)  Will steam and support my sis.  Let's go guys.
Also love the jewelry they are wearing everyone looks amazing
1.5M lets go

Just 20k to go to 1.5M let's go lumina
1.4M done
fatoui is so beautiful😍
K-pop music videos filmed in Korea  showcase attractive and beautiful backdrops that portray unique aesthetics and concepts. The music video failed to feature the diverse aesthetic of India that could have created a visual masterpiece and a unique and memorable quality to the video. By choosing to feature some of the stunning locations and culturally diverse Indian aesthetics, the video could have had a more diverse and aesthetic representation of India.  LOVE THE SONG & THE GIRLS ❤❤❤
GUYS WHAT HAPPENED WHY THE VIƏWS ARE SLOW AGAIN PLEASE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT ATLEAST 1.8M TILL 4DAY STARTS!!!
BRRR TATATA
love this so much, the concept too love it.  anyway just me or the music is to loud, i can't hear their voices clean. maybe my earphone is broken
Wish they add eng subtitles so that it reach wider audience
Nvee is so gorgeous, and talentest! Your presence is perfect!
This is perfect! Oh my! Queens! Incrible, fantastic, awesome, gorgeous, beautiful!
Fighting girls 💪🏻
Keep doing ur best always.....this is amazing...music.. video...outfits....stay blessed...

えーーめっちゃ好き中毒性あんね🥺✨ アップテンポじゃないけど民族系のテンポに緩やかな重みの音がめっちゃ耳に残る メンバー入れ替わりすぎて心配だったけど新生BlackSwan期待大だわ✨✨ 音楽配信サービスにもはよ反映されてよ本当…🎧
Almost 640K of subscribers in Blackswan!
This M/V is awesome, and gorgeous! I loved this scenery, girls, and presence! Perfect!
Wow song lyrics is amazing and I am big fan black swan ❤❤❤❤
Almost 1.5M Lumina!
Nvee Gabi Sriya Fatou Blackswan Lumina
kpop doesn't make sense with people who aren't asian or don't have ancestry. K-POP was created precisely for Koreans/Asians to have a place in the industry. Gabi and Fatou, you definitely don't belong in K-POP.
Ittttt issss amezing sriya didi is amezing with alll the members i loved all members here plus scren timing of all is just perfect ❤❤❤
Let's go 3M in this week, lumina! Fight! Hardcore!
It’s a very good song
I love Blackswan forever! The queens!
Almost 1.5M
Blackswan & Lumina; Fight Forever!
Amazing and love from India
This M/V is fantastic! Oh my! Let's go to 1.5M Lumina!
The mv production is unbelievably gorgeous  The ladies looks so fabulous I'm crying The songs is very lyra Crossing fingers for their future in dr music since their predecessor groups are all short lived
It's really so good
Let's go 1.5M Lumina! Stream Fight!
Thanks sriya for this surprise and all team, so sweet of u ❤
I love blackswan! The blackswan is insane!  The presence and dance is hardcore!

Great rap + great vocals + great dance = perfect performance. Well done BlackSwan!

Ekdam bariya... Bolna nai.. ❤️❤️

I heat this song because in this song is  so old types  india is so growing country and members dresses is so old fashion  indian people is  not vare this dress and vesuls is 🤮🤮  and which state  I'm  Indian from chhattisgarh  🙄 this  karma or keeping the fire ma keep in the fire is bater MV  Sorry but it's reality it's not good but it's not bad 👍
блин, мне очень понравилось. даже лучше, чем с предыдущим составом.
The MV is beautiful, the song is catchy, the girls can all sing and dance so well!!! This is the best Blackswan line up 🤩
Cultural appropriation at its peak

I dont think that it is a kpop band! They are just promoting hindus ! there is no way that it is kpop
This MV is so beautiful and the members are so talented!!!!

💞💞
English version please!!
Love to see something far more different in kpop industry, we'll always support you Blackswan♥️✨😻
Seriously, but this is the best lineup. All of them are Aces and all rounded. They put a really high level of standard with their performance on Inkigayo.   Synergy between 4 of them is INSANE! They have a huge potential to become one of the TOP GG with a right promotion!
Oh this is so cool 😮
Estoy enamorada de esta canción y de este videoclip, me alegra mucho ver que, después de que lo viera tras el estreno, está creciendo mucho en visitas. ¡Estoy tan orgullosa de lo que estáis consiguiendo!
where are you from?
who is your bias?
The makeup, jewellery, place,moves everything was so new and realistic 😮
Our Odisha 🙇🏻‍♀️😍💖✨
Sing Bhajan in India if u want to be popular here 😂
I like that but something went wrong when I see that song I observed that sriya lines are so less in comparison to other members❤
I actually love this...the song and the fashion...but they could've adjusted the white balance a skosh.
❤❤❤❤
If they don't become one of the top Kpop groups In the future smth is wrong, cuz I am absolutely speechless simply superior
I am just happy that they didn't show India in the typical yellow tinted frame!!!
Whose tv antenna is that??
This is the best, as a Lockey I Love this Song. And OMG Fatou become more and more pretty. I hope BlackSwan got more attention cuz I know how it feel when our girls didn't get that. Thank you BlackSwan for your Comeback song that great song and MV.
Congratulations for 200k likes...

Some thoughts: 0:16 Fatou is looking like a literal Queen in that Purple gown. 1:07 NVee Just fits this Indian concept very well.... 2:51 Shriya's vocals in the bridge is so catchy. 0:09 Gabi's visuals and vocals with the dense forest background is just a big thumbs up. Overall this song was amazing and is on my playlist 🌸🌸🌸

I've been waiting for this moment for an actual K-pop group with non-Korean members. The unexpected thing is they did diverse with different Cultures showcasing Sriya's home country which is India. Can't wait to witness showcasing Fatou, Gabi, and Nvee's home country's cultures.

The black girl feels like an entirely new concept in Kpop. It feels so refreshing to accept the girls as who they are and not Koreanising them.   Love from India
Okay this is such an bop
Acho que o quê sinto no meu coração é esperança. Esperança para o grupo que passou por tempos difíceis e esperança por diversidade,respeito e olhares à mais para inclusão naquele país atrasado chamado Coreia do Sul.  Lumina precisa brilhar fortemente com o Blackswan.
The diversity!!!
I think since I am kpop fan..this is the first video where I can really watch indian cultural  appreciation  in a proper way ...I am really happy ❤❤
❤❤❤
Fatou visual in this mv is just ✨

У них группа ещё жива?
Black swan gonna be next black pink
A lot a love from India
I don't understand why they are attacking her... I don't know if it's cultural appropriation because I'm not Indian and at least I know something about it but I liked the song and the mv too, they worked hard for it, I don't think it's fair to hate them like that while 'you ' don't dare to lift a finger to clean a floor, you guys did a good job, I just hope you don't go into a basement again
keep going black swan, love from India
When people say that Blackswan are flop they are lying because they have more likes then other kpop groups who have 20M views ! Is because blackswan don't use ads for views like other K-pop groups is that why i want they company to do also youtube ads for them to have more views 😢
I have exactly those pink ear rings the white girl was wearing, I think she's Gabi.  they really went local for this video. Love it.
Я в шоке! Как красиво представили культуру! Костюмы, всё стилизовано и так подходит девочкам, очень красиво. Локации 🤯 И песня, просто ДА ✨
I think BLACKSWAN is Givin' new concept to kpop!!! ❤❤❤
Blackswan you guys real rocked the concept..appreciative
🔥🔥🔥
omg i just discovered this group???????  are they from india? or korea? im confused >
Best thing is this is first k-pop mv which didn't mess up with Indian culture otherwise if you watch other k-pop mv related to Hindu/India they have messed up somewhere.. there's sreya that's why they got some guidance to not mess up
I like the slowest vocal part it's so beautiful Sriya Gabi & Nvee
This mv is a masterpiece.❤️‍🔥
anjayyyyyyy
This song becomes 4th most viewed on Black Swan mv in 2 days
Love the Indian touch ❤
Love this mv so unique concept... beautiful

Wow primera vez que las veo y es asombrosa la variedad en voces, ambientes, cultura que trae esté grupo!!! sus voces son distintas y me encanta!!😍 Alguien que me diga sus nombres porfavor!

Muy buena canción y muy buen rap me encanta ❤
Isso sim é superar expectativas, viciei
Omg just landed on my brand new obsetion❤️❤️
Sirya 🐼🐼
Hermosas
I'm new here. Can someone enlightened me, please?
Me encanta este grupo 😍 representa dentro del Kpop lo verdaderamente internacional ❤️
Im used to seeing kpop with east and southeast asian members. But Blackswan made it possible that kpop is not just for east and southeast asian .
El coro es adictivo
wow that's cool, by the way why don't they just use full English and keep focusing on the international market, not Korean 😊
Our beautiful odisha.... ଧନ୍ୟବାଦ ଆମ ଓଡ଼ିଆ ଝିଅ ଶ୍ରୀୟା କୁ <3  Thank you for coming 💜
Whole our odisha     thankuuuuuuuuu so muchhhhhhhh😭
Vi la presentación ayer por casualidad que joyita es la primera vez que un gg me agrada. su imagen no estereotipada es llamativa
I feel like they shouldn't be singing in Korean since there isn't any Korean singers. The dance was amazing and the song was catchy but I do feel it shouldn't be in Korean but in their native languages. I have them all sing in their born languages instead.
LINDASSS
copying stayc's teddy bear coreo huh
I LOVE YOUR MUSIC I LOVE YOUR DANCE
Sooo good 🔥🔥🔥
Who's your bias in blackswan
nice song
Las conocí por AESPA en inkygayo así que las apoyaré ❤

Hermosa canción! no sé por qué no staneaba a este gran grupo!!! Me estuve perdiendo grandes temazos :( De todo corazón, espero que tengan muchísimo más apoyo en este comeback! <3
Es la primera vez que veo un agrupación sin coreanas, aunque cantan en un grupo kpop las apoyo black swan
너무 좋아
Me gustó muchisismo
This girl group had to overcome racism and hatred from Koreans and international fans alike for having dark skinned girls.
Es interesante encontrar esto en el K-pop, es muy fresco e innovador
Fighting ❤
Me gusta la cancion pero no deberian ser un grupo de kpop porque van a terminar mal asi como KAACHI
Where is Leia?
tá muito incrível  arrasam demais!!
Geniales ,espero que sigan creciendo 💖
meu deus esse grupo ainda existe
sem leia sem like
Let's go for the win
they are so tall
they ate tho
🎉🎉because they don't make more commercial songs, the sound at the end is great
Fatou i love you voice,
A voz da fatuo é grossa isso estragou a música
Muito feliz de ver novas músicas ❤❤
Go girls❤
If someone wear indian American's costume, ppl call it cutural approproation. But if someone wear india costume like this, ppl call it appreciation. I really don't understand indian american
Now this is something I can dance to
This Indian is gonna do a very big thing .....sriya ❤❤ Other members did their well best   Love you Black Swan
Loved the song ❤
Cute

This song based on Indian concept۔ proud to be an Indian

노래 너무 좋고 뮤비도 감각적이네요!!
o rap da Fatou, sempre maravilhoso ❤❤❤
I love how it got over 1 million views, hope it gets the recognition it deserves !
Está incrível
La canción, coreografía, vestuario y calidad del vídeo mejoraron mucho
it's a very lazy thought to think that kicking out korean members to purposefully put in members from other parts of the world is a positive thing. imagine a musical genre 100% originating in your country being performed by groups where 0% is composed of people from the original country. what this group is doing is disrespecting korean culture, kpop history and the way kpop is conceived. that's why this group will never work. but it seems that stating the obvious offends wind brains. zero love for kpop, it's just people surfing kpop hype for money and a bunch of uncritical people supporting it.
2M before tomorrow please
Eu amei
International Superstars!!! Love to see them do well !!
Brasileiros deviam apoiar!!!🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
✨💙✨ Какое красивое видео!
Ok, perfect
This is so queenie
😻😻
Blackswan está vencendo a votação no Star Planet!!! Vamos continuar votando para garantir a vitória amanhã!!!!!
1.4M UNTIL TODAY! LET'S GO LUMINAS!
I feel like instead of going the k-pop route they should have done an XG and marketed globally instead. This comeback looks great tho I hope for their success
오오옹
오오오오
오오오
ficou muito bomm🎉
ESSA ELAS LACRARAM
İf you say "i hate blackswan bc they are not korean" are you stupid? Blackswan is perfect

1.3M
Slayy
Tocó estanear karma amixes!!!
Honestly I was surprised (in the best of ways!) by how good this song is. It's very nice to hear and well done, which made me even more captivated to accompany BLACKSWAN. And the MV's production is so good too, it turned out amazing! Let's support these girls everyone!!!
💖💖💖💖💖💖💓💓💓💓💗💗💗💓💓💖💓💓💗
1.3M here we go
Morning Luminas :)
So nice 😍
J'adore ❤ ❤  Très beau MV et très belle musique.  Je suis contente de revoir le groupe avec les 3 nouveaux membres. Je trouve le groupe plus harmonieux sans les chanteuses coréennes. Dans les autres MV, je trouvais que l'on mettait trop l'accent sur Hyeme, Youngheun et Judy. Leia et Fatou, reléguées en arrière plan.  Bon courage pour la suite !!! 😊
Common luminas we got this 2m by tomorrow let's go
Waaa apik
1.3 Million! Exactlyyy
This is actually so good love it
Damnn
woah this is GORGEOUS!!!
mt bom namoraaal
Wait... the shooting is done in odisha?? The background temple looks like lingaraj temple and words written in odia😮😮
Aaaaaaaah ame mucho mucho ❤
O coooooolll
Wow o mv ficou muito legal, as cores ficaram muito boas também, elas fizeram um ótimo trabalho torço para que elas voem muito.
Perfeita
Knets actually like this song and aren’t talking shit about them being korean or not. It’s the international fans that are being dumb lol. Blackswan doing their thing. Period.
Love 💙💙😍😍🇧🇷
hold on their music is kinda hitting
This is what a proper music video is like. I like their aesthetics.
LET'GOO 2 M!!!
This is the most visual MV ever.
Finalmente a Dr acertou em uma música pro BS.
the scenes where Fatou is surrounded by people are sooo cool!!
💖
♡♡♡
I don't know why they hesitate to shoot India's develope place as well
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Is this charting on the korean charts yet
So close to 1.3M views!!! Keep str3@mlng!!!
vote for blackswan on star planet!
Okay Indian culture yaas ❤️‍🔥
Eita ficou muito bom não tava esperando um visual e um vocal tão maravilhoso
Cara.. Que orgulho da Gabi 🥲♥️🇧🇷
Nonsense  Sakshma Such a rooted with her india  , She Never Take those Arrogant BlackPINK team To this show  , u nibbie Fans Go and they are nonsense. They Brain nonsense , Ruin other culture amd still u some Indian Nibbiies Support those arrogent Idols , Support those Idols who appreciate their fans , and support , if.
They need to win 🎉
THIS is cultural appreciation 🤩
Wheres the "K" of kpop?? Language, company blah blah... They are appropriating a culture and misrepresenting the essence of kpop and you stand there defending it. Time will tell if the attitude (lack of) is harmful or not for kpop. Good luck wind brains ♥️
The song is pretty good! And the video is overall creative. The formation I do have mixed feelings about. I love the charisma and presence of Fatou, Sraiya and Gabi. The three of them would have been in my opinion a strong group by itself and well balanced. My critical point with this new formation is Nvee. I find that she lacks presence and feels distant, almost insecure, in front of the camera. I also watched the live performance of this comeback and unfortunately she couldn't change my mind as a viewer. I hope she works on her stage presence more in the future so she can keep up with the rest and their strong image.
😵😵😵
WOW what a mind-blowing MV!! Bravo BLACKSWAN❤❤❤

Ate
sugar with Kimtaeyung   right now She shooting for Blackswan And then Both going For Travel 😭 and Bts company Delibratly ,,, Doing This crosplay for Their Own profit By Hyping v with Jennie 😭 Very Bad
I love
I really hope they capitalize and don’t wait a year to give them another comeback. They need to release consistently to work and this team is by far the best of RAINIA and Black Swan. I don’t care what you say lol.
Nunca había escuchado este grupo, pero está canción es muy buena 🤨☝️
Blackswan Slay!
I have a question... how does their company have so much money to sustain this group? I dont mean any hate just curious if they had a famous senior group in the company or something before....coz usually a group will try for like a couple of years to hit it but they've been trying to make black swan a hit for some time now n before that with Rania... so I'm wondering where their money comes from
SLAY

Lol I started a small trend in the comment section
If you don't mind Black Swan Official , can you please give us English subtitles in this "KARMA" music video for international fans viewers. For understanding this song perfectly. Please forgive me if you get hurt by words. The thing is we really love this song very much. So that's why I, we are requesting you.

MEU DEUS ESSAS GAROTAS SÃO TÃO TALENTOSAS E EU TORÇO TANTO POR ELAS😭😭😭  É realmente um grande desafio pra elas justamente por causa da grande diversidade do grupo, e por todas as dificuldades que já passaram e com certeza ainda vão passar, mas eu de verdade acredito no grande potencial delas, até porque todas as garotas são extremamente talentosas e eu sei que elas conseguem chegar longe!  Vou estar sempre torcendo pro Blackswan e para essas meninas encantarem o mundo com a sua diversidade <33
Vou considerar essa como A ESTREIA do grupo porque PQP que estouro! 🖤
Now blackswan are dope! I love all members!!! They sing better the previous members..

Being an Indian n odia ,I must say they have represented our culture in international level n when it comes to MV this is really amezing. This is the beauty of our India.
I Love Blackswan! This girls are so gorgeous and perfect!
MEU DEUS QUE INCRÍVEL
Hey⚠️This is an important question for blackswan fans ⚠️ Does anyone know if they only showed up to INKIYAGO? OR THEY WILL BE PRESENTED IN MORE PLACES, I SAY IT BECAUSE AESPA WENT THERE LIKE 4 TIMES, BLACKSWAN SHOULD GO MORE TIMES
Gabi é a mulher mais linda que ja pisou na terra
Hope you all the best Black Swan !! Love from France 😘🇨🇵
This song is quite good 🙈🩷✨
Every scene had been shot in odisha i think.....coz every place is recognizable...good job blackswan ....proud of u shreya...!!
They shot the whole thing in different parts of Orissa 😍😍😍😍 soo beautiful ❤️
INDIA state - odisha , location-Dhauli
가비야 사랑해
Nvee's High Note is chilling
The goal is 2M before tomorrow. Please Luminas stream
Good song
好听
Gabiiiiiiiii 사랑해요
Fatuo ❤❤❤❤
Hidden KARD here👋 Im shoocked, love it !!! ❤
I know it's not good to say this, but I missed Leia's presence, she has a stage presence that I can't explain, congratulations to the girls who are starting gabi sriya and nvee ❤
O melhor álbum delas ate agora, espero que o próximos tenha mais músicas ❤❤❤❤
Sriya is so beautiful
Blackswan has come a LONG WAY & THEY ATE LEFT NO CRUMBS
Wow love your style❤
Vamos fazer 2M em 7 dias❤
Gabi is my bias, but Nvee really catches my attention with her beautiful look and impeccable vocals
Looove it
This Mv is so beautiful that I felt the need to rewatch it. Recently I saw a show which explored India (especially its traditions) and it’s a very beautiful Country.
i wonder if they are gonna give us a "song" for each member, indian song for  sriya, a brazilian song for gaby, senegal for fatou, and a english kpop song for nvee, who is from the united states, that would be cool.
this song is addictive
I heard we might get a special video for reaching 1M views, imagine if we hit 2 or 5M views. 🤩
Essa música é viciante
That karma ❤❤❤❤
Now United 2.0
Don't slow down Luminas...the target is never 1M only, stream as much as possible...and show them the appreciation they deserve!
Wow 😳❤
Increíble siento sue ellas deberian de ser re famosas, esto es increíble tienen mucho talento, esto es mejor
Is this shooted in odisha?

I love the new direction they're taking and I'd love for that to be the main concept of the group. They're comprised of mixed cultures so I think it'd be great for them to showcase that in their music.
Música muito boa 👍

I most like that ta ta ta part.
So beautiful. I wish them the best
A korean group without one korean member, mhmmm good job on this shitty group, the company just need to make it a new group instead of depending on the old group members who were korean bit the company kept just changing over over, what is the point of this? For me this a group that would never be kpop or consider korean
Odisha🙏
2 million here we come Luminas

I'm not a fan of kpop. But watching this video for Sriya lenka. And that's called a MV. Well done to the team! How beautifully they showed beauty and rich culture of Odisha, India. Really liked it.
Fish man it's soo catchy..  (灬♥ω♥灬)
What a song wow❤
This is such a unique and iconic mv ever🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wowowowowowo

The "be tatataa" is so addictive <33
This is amazing
U guys r so pretty and love the indian concept u guys deserve more fame for trying the def concept❤❤❤❤
É tão bem ver uma brasileira exibindo o seu talento não sua fã mais eu tô virando amei o blackswan🥰
Because of Indian member this group becoming famous
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
i'm so glad Kpop can show more of the cultural diversity of Asia! I hope this can improving and also having more and more international idols.
The song is powerful, all of the girls look amazing, the choreo is fierce... what a great comeback for BLACKSWAN, i hope the girls get lot of success and love they deserve
The way it still sounds very KPop even with the Indian music influence is amazing for me. Lately some KPop songs are getting more and more experimental, which can be great but I do miss the classic KPop structure and music. It's great!!
Can anyone tell me what the member changes were? I feel like I only recognize Fatou from before
200k de likes Go!
Awesome!

Let's boost the comment
Its a shame that korean audience and fans are not accepting this group. For sure Blackswan will make hit overseas. I consoder them as Global pop group not  Kpop group for now. As long their is prejudice in kpop then there is no diversity especially having a black skin idol in the group. We all know how harsh koreans when it comes to racism.
1 🌽ão muito bem muito bom ❤❤❤

Ta-ta-ta...💥🛐💖
This is the first time I am watching black swan and the girls are so good! Love the song! Fatou has a unique voice tone and Gabi is totally pretty with great vocals! 🤩
Gabi is representing us very well🇧🇷, but I'm a little worried, I hope the company doesn't change the members, or remove or add more. they can grow to be just the 4 of them, I hope the company thinks twice before trying to do something. look, 1 million views in 2 days, a lot of presence, great vocals, raps, dancing. please keep it up
I SEE THE LIGHT BRUU TA TA TA essa música tá tão BOA mano
Wow beautiful guys give it more more likes
This song is BEAUTIFULLL💖💖
Este MV quedará en la historia del K-Pop como uno de los más hermosos y significativos, además de demostrar el talento de 4 chicas de distintas partes del mundo, es un homenaje a quienes seguimos esta música desde fuera de Corea del Sur.
this is shot in odisha ohmygod. dhauli giri, bindu sagar area damn
Confundida. Con sentimientos mezclados. Me recuerda mucho a K/DA, sus visuales son más como un dance crew. Por lo tanto hay talento. Se les desea lo mejor y que esta vez su agencia no la cague 🤞🏽 pueden llegar a ser las nueva Little Mix
As a odia just say awesome cinematography & happy to see it 😊 jay jagannathh

RIP LEIA
Best kpop MV I ever seen( ˘ ³˘)♥
Welcome back ❤️❤️❤️
meu pai, elas ganharam uma musica boa!
❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
ok slayyyyy
The locations and outfits are so pretty!!! I'm glad I clicked on this :)
I hope they add the subtitles soon
I'm so proud of how far the group came,the mv lets all members shine and show the cultural diversity within the group♡ ALSO the styling is insaneee
Im glad Blackswan did not give up!! Congratulations to the Blackswan Fandom!🎉🎉
🥰🥰
Gabi and Nvee sound so good together
Love the music, the representation, the dance, the mv, but why are the outfits so ugly though? As an Indian, the jewellery and outfits look very tacky by all standards. Kpop and Indian fashion are both so unique and amazing, and this really is giving college wala fashion show vibes.
Fatouuuuuu omg
Sriya's vocals make me feel hypnotised
Where is this billboard located? I need to see
I don't know why but I freaking got goosebumps hearing this! Their voices are so beautiful! This is also, indeed, a beautiful form of culture appreciation! Even the concept, music, real visuals of India and their costumes are awesome.. As an Indian, I am so proud of Sriya.. she was able to represent her own state as well! Rest of them are equally amazing... Kudos to Blackswan and lots of love!! <3
This is super amazing ❤
❤❤❤
I Love Blackswan! This queens are insane!
Odisha.... India's best kept secret
I love the song❤
Blackswan is the revolution!
The music video reminds me of LOONA... A literal cultural masterpiece! I hope the group continues to do well.
Just saw the inkigayo stage and these girls ate
Omg this is so nice 😭😭😭😭
I just loved it. The presentation was really cool
Lumina share this mv with your friends and family
slayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Wow , including cultural things is best , all are awesome ❤  I love this music video ❤
Let’s go blackswan ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
They were all stupendous! So happy for them. I loved the setting. The architecture, makeup, fashion and atmosphere was so beautiful. Just great.
blackswan  came back with everything karma
Woke up and saw the one million count let's go !!

I m so proud 1M❤
Guys keep streaming let's go for 2m now
OMG THIS SLAPS
brr tatata
In 1 month this video will have more than 10 million views so much it's a bop 😭
Ça ose des trucs c’est cool (sans vouloir dénigrer les autres groupes par ce que je connais pas tout et c’est dur de parler d’originalité dans la kpop je trouve celui là (le MV) atypique 😄
I really can't believe they shot this in freaking ODISHA my homeland OMG ❤❤❤❤❤
Queens
where are 1 dollars and a dream?
OMG I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS!! GO BLACKSWAN!! 🔥 🔥
I love everything about this
Can you guys please please please do the next one in my cousin’s country Bangladesh please please ❤❤❤since you guys already stay in Korean in my country but this one of my wish to see one of my fav K-pop group in Bangladesh
1m🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😮😮😊😊😊😊
This is absolutely STUNNING. The visuals of not only of the lovely women but the scenery in India itself? Just.. wow.. Enchanting. Also, the rap and the vocals are amazing, and I can't wait to hear more! <33 Amazing job, ladies!!
Congrats
노래 좋네 근데 여기는 이제 아예 한국인이 없네 한국인 없는 케이팝 걸그룹이라니 칵투밖에 모르겠다 그래도 국내 애매한 뮤비보다 인도 로케가 낫네
You girls slayed !!!
I am not happy with this video because it doesn't really reflect my  beautiful india ,my india is really really beautiful than this ,so please change your stereotypes about india and don't show such thongs
Finally 1M views! Loved the mv! They have made this with utmost care! As an Indian, I really feel so proud to see this way of representing Indian culture. Every single scene has got it's own cultural significance portraying the diversified preferences in Indian culture, featuring different kinds of dances, monuments, sculptures, people belonging to different communities and so on. Gotta appreciate their unique idea of appreciating Indian culture in a kpop song/mv. One of the most powerful comebacks in the kpop history, should admit!
The only K-pop groups music I actually listen too ❤
GUYS FOCUS NOW ON THE LIVE PERFORMANCE TOO WHILE S+RƏAMING WATCH THEM TOO!!
First time watching them and I'm in love
I am really happy she is really Proud of our state she represents our odisha so well 🥰🥰🥰 odia jhia I love her love towards her nation and state let's support them they're really unique

THIS MV IS SOOO GOOD   THE MUSIC 10000000/10 THE MV 10000000/10 THE VISUALS 10000000/10  THIS IS A MASTERPIECE ✨❤
I love this so much. Such an organic and actually accurate representation of a country/culture. It's refreshing. I hope they do this with all the cultures of origin for the members. It's beautiful.
This is very good  special your dance step or mv real

1만 바둑 루미나와 블랙스완 사랑해요 여러분 ❤❤❤
They really improved,Now my fav Black Swan song
Love you from Thailand ❤
это невероятно красивый клип.. Песня очень запоминающаяся! ♡
Finally a kpop group without a annoying dance or so easy
BLACKSWANにエチオピア人が加入しても我はもう驚かない自信あります。(^_^;)
ih cakep bener mv nya🤧🤧🤧
My suggestion is providing subtitles in the caption with respective members' languages, Korean, and English so people can understand the MV and song more.    Second, I think we reached the final combination for this group. The members compliment each other and they're perfect. Also, finally a GOOD song and MV in the midst of standardized kpop platform? Yes!   Edit : there's a reply to my comment that said they should go international at this point. I kind of agree, it can be a brilliant idea if done right. The girls can still make kpop music from time to time, while reaching wider audience.    I said from time to time since their strength in the first place WAS being a "unique" kpop group. Going off the kpop platform and more towards international truly has the potential advantage of gaining more fans worldwide, but it also has the risk of the group being too generalized by singing english ( most songs in the music industry uses english, and it can get pretty boring )  Maybe they can be an international group and make songs with mixed languages ?
Finally 1M views in 48 hrs .  Let's go BLACKSWAN & Lumina Fighting 🖤 ❤💜
Beautifully depicted the blend of  culture of India with Korean song ....you guys nailed it ...... watching and listening again and again
YEEEEEEESSS!!!!❤🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤ My girls are back!!! We love seeing diverse talented groups getting a deserved push, budget, & production!!!
I didn't like the members when they debut, But now I see a real talent
😍😍❤️❤️🔥🔥
Какая необычная,красивая,талантливая группа..классные голоса и песня огонь..❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Faiting!!!!!
This mv deserves more recognition.
I'm waiting sooooo long🙃🙃🙃🙃, it finally reached one million views 🤗🤗🤗🤗 I'm really happy for them .❤❤❤

Love from ODISHA❤️
Absolutely in love with this looks in this mv!!! But please please stop making Fatou wear that shade of purple I beg I beg. It showed up in two outfits😭
If we made 1M we can make 2M and more, keep supporting and streaming Luminas!
Honestly, they could have chosen a better place in 0:41
Вау, я даже не думала, что это будет настолько хорошо. Песня цепляет с первых секунд и не теряется среди одинаково звучащих новинок. Клип просто шикарнейший. Показать культуру другой нации через концепт и при этом не выйти из рамок кпопа - это то, что они смогли сделать просто великолепно💟 💘💘💘
Proud of this queens<333
1M!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wonderful
I dont stan them but this MV is so well made and have a high quality. And so do the song, it's really really great to listen to.I LOVE IT

2:53 bridge
I love it ❤❤❤❤
Nice,I bot find of this group more ant of their.songs but this is.alr
It's an MV nwith culture n classic n elegance❤all of them look like goddess❤
please 🙏 I'm not a hater. But , people just potrait indian culture by filming in north india, mentioning hindi. just mention it as north India only . And i feel like south Indians are not Indian's. Many Indians gives wrong information about India to foreigners like Indian's only speak hindi and its the national language, they only wear lehenga. These types of video will only increase these type of pov to people. In south India maximum people can't even understand Hindi. So its all about north don't say INDIA.
which one is the indian ??
Congrats for 1M views blackswan  we all will always support you all  🎉
I’m actually super surprised by the quality of this comeback. The Blackswan/Rania brand has been so scandal prone for years now and add in some key member changes and I was sure they’d likely disband. Even when they added the new members in after replacing the Korean members, I was worried about the final output. But this was actually a solid comeback. They gave them a budget for the MV AND the song. Decent line distribution and, for some reason, the group seems stronger. I’m looking forward to the live performances for this comeback and hopefully this leads to their eventual success. Especially in the case of the Fatou, who really has been riding with this group till the wheels fall off/keeping it alive at this point.
Not bad it's good
This song shoot in odisha goosebumps love from odisha
Let's go luminas
Love it 😘

Fandom name Light stick
방금 인기가요 무대도 보고 왔는데, 요번 노래는 진짜 모든게 완벽하다. 솔직히 close to me는 노래 퀄리티도 그렇고 너무 별로였는데. 요번 노래는 전원 외국인 멤버라는 블랙스완만의 특색이 잘 녹아든듯함. 노래도 좋고, 뮤비도 잘만든듯. 요번 노래에서 대성했음 좋겠다 ~ 최대한 유튜브든 예능이든 방송이든 많이 출연해서 홍보 좀 확실히 했음. 특색있어서 충분히 어필될 거 같은데.. + 그리고 멤버 변경 그만 좀 하고 지금있는 멤버로 활동 잘 하고, 다음 컴백도 빨리 했음함.  소속사 일해라 ~~~
Por incrível que pareça, vou ficou bom. Boa sorte aí manas, eu parei de acompanhar depois de close to me mas essa aí ficou boa
thank you for representing India 💗
❤❤❤
Love the pre-chorus specially Gabi's line thts sooo addictive!!!
They change the theme of their group, super different from other kpop groups it's fits perfectly 🤍🖖🏻
There were not many luminas in the inkigayo performance please korean luminas come on learn the fanchant and make their performances more better!
We all r looking beautiful Queens r rocking this time
Be positive and healthy always  BLACKSWAN HWAITING 💪
Yeh we got 1 million ...now more to come 🎉

After all these yrs I have finally seen something different from typical kpop concepts.. And this is amazing and mesmerizing... What a comeback Blackswan!!! The diversity in the group members' personalities is the best thing about this group.. They are writing new history in kpop industry..  I hope they keep progressing new path and different music/concepts like this..

I LOVE ALL THESE OUTFITS FR  WELL DONE OUTFITS TEAM
we need our lyrics😢😢
Очень нравится 🔥🔥
1 MILLION YAY!! LET'S KEEP GOING
Um these women have great talent and did a very nice job with that being said. I think this is quite strange that this group has Korean lyrics but have no Korean members. Not even a half Korean person. They want to Brand themselves as a Global or multinational group then the songs should be in English, no? I know this act has been around, rebranded, redebuted and had several different lineups but once you have no Korean members remaining you have to change your approach imo. Its giving some shades of cultural appropriation. It's not these ladies fault. Their management cannot push them to make kpop songs when none of them are Korean.
A perfect MV and shriya killed it really hard even her debut is quite seems she's is a professional...proud of u gurll!!! Saranghae to all!!🖤
無理に韓国に寄せたビジュアルにせず、4人にしか出せない異国スタイリングでK-POPアイドルらしい歌を歌うのが最高にかっこいい！！！
🎉❤congratulations for 1 million views 👏

This is so good!!!
I am not saying this bcz I'm an Indian, this song is better than most of the mainstream kpop songs. This should definitely win some awards. The mv, the cinematography, the music, visuals,  the message,  everything is super good.

Loved it,
The MV gives off a nostalgic vibe. I like the colours & the culture appreciation.

This is so good my goshh Fan from 🇵🇭
Indian jwellery ☄️🫂
Loved this song 💖
That karma❤
Considering blackswans history Idk how long this will last but let’s be happy we got this when we could. Also I think they are going to create a new pathway for kpop, by acknowledging the Indian fans and market. While kpop is so intent on dominating the west they neglect the potential that exists at home. In Asia. I hope the girls do well
Loved the song😊💜
I'm literally getting goosebumps. Lots of love from Odisha ❤ These girls ate it and left no crumbs🤗
Let’s hit 1M Lumina!

Fatou always badass🔥
Lumina we're doing great!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
This is a master piece... It's like I want to say loads of things but don't know how to express everything.. Each and every second of this mv is mesmerising.. It's a cultural blend.. And I have to talk about theirs looks , outfits, concepts 👏👏👏👏👏👏 amazing.. Just love it!!  And look at Sriya.. All the members are amazing.. But Sriya looks like a 7-8 yrs experienced PRO idol here.. Her confidence and attitude !!  She is like " We are in India , and this is my territory.. Bring it on!! ".. You are on fire girl!!
I want caption 😢  They deserve more views guys
❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks for showing the culture of our odisha😊😊
Wow❤❤
Me encanta el vídeo, un vestuario muy bonito y estáis preciosas 👏👏🥰🥰❤❤
FINALLY AFTER 84 YEARS THEY ARE BACK AND WITH A BANGER. The MV is one of the best I have seen. It's so rich in culture and I love MVs when they are filmed in actual locations instead of green screens and ugly cgi. Anyways, they look stunning and I love the makeup and outfits so much, DR finally stepped up. Now I hope they can give them the promotion they deserve and regular comebacks. PRAYER CIRCLE LUMINAS
❤Outstanding Song ❤

I always wonder that why foreigner celebrities only visit to village area or town areas.... Then their viewers thinks that we are not that developed and they think lowly about our environment....

Being an Indian... I'm very proud and happy that they are showing our Indian Culture... Lots of love from India... 🇮🇳❣️❣️

Let's hit 1M lumina
Love ❤❤❤ this song is amazing 😊🎉
I hope that with this comeback they get the success they deserve.   Love blackswan 🖤🦢
I'm not hating them but i have doubt 🧐🤔 on production most of thime it looked so bad except the temple and auto rap. Lighting is awful, location choice, choosing the wrong time to shoot, I mean I'm not a professional but i worked in some dance videos that's why I can tell production quality and people they used it's not good for the song.
Lets make it 1M before the Inkigayo performance Lumina dont give up
Omg is that dhauli, odisha omgggg
Eu amei a música
Why their costumes are not look good and hair style 🥴 but background is awesome
Fatou  Nvee Gabi Sriya  BLACKSWAN 🦢 🖤
Leta go 1M we can do it Lumina
Com essa mudança toda.. nao tem mais pq esse grupo ainda existir, Deveriam dar disband. Saudades Leia😢
Lumina we got this
Keep it up black swan ❤️❤️👍👍👑👑
❤❤❤
Maravilhosas Gabi representando o Brasil está perfeito ❤🇧🇷
Welcome to Odisha, India❤❤❤
FATOU'S RAP DUDEEEEEE
Lumina we're crushing it!!!
I love you girl’s
Such a beautiful MV black swan
Let's make it 1M ...... 🎉❤
I don't understand why they sing in Korean language if none of them are Korean girls...? It really doesn't make sense to me.. I thought when the mv began that they'd sing in English and Indian language for example. They sound so good but is strange  hearing this with all members being foreigners and their fans are foreigners too, not Koreans here reading comments.
The credit goes to sriya❤❤❤
1M gooo
❤❤❤ as an Indian I'm so proud ❤
Eu gostei de vdd, mas cade a leia? Nossa quanto tempo eu dormir que nao fiquei sabendo dessa mudança toda? Kkkkk😂 gente mudou td mundo praticamente

Vamso logo para 1M ãoooo
Impecável e bem trabalhado
Ficou perfeito ❤
Beauty just it 😮😮❤
i really love the way depicted our culture
That karmaaa < 3
Tragam uma brasileiraaa
the mv should have focused more on the member than on other random ppl, only my opinion. the song is very good tho way better than what i expected the singing is strong and their korean definitively got better. ppl will take them more seriously with this cb
Nice
THE BRIDGE WOWW
Guys let's go 10 million
they need more recognition ❤
It's amazing how this group makes a comeback with all the bullying cases that exist between the members themselves. I thought this group had already dissolved lol hahahahaha
OMG SO AMAZINGGG
Omg this is so good  fell in love the song and the voice everything is A1 . Everything was so balanced  . I never thought  Indian  music  and korean  pop can sound so good in in a song . Very Very congratulations for your victory Black Swan
Nem o itzy q é meu número 1 não trás uma reviravolta dessa kk  Blackswan entregou tudo quando ninguém mais tinha esperança ❤ simplesmente perfeito ❤
Luminas i hope you will make the million! Im trying my best
I really love them❤ I hope they can be more popular in the future!!
Me encanta esta alineación

Que essa formação fique assim é só coloca a Leia de volta ❤
No karma its Darma
❤
Wow I don't understand really people are like When other kpop group using Indian culture: culture appropriate. Apologies  When a kpop grp with Indian member: support. We love you and are proud.   Really shame to be indian right now. Literally now one abusing the culture is Indian themself.  I support all grp who used the Indian culture because everyone can use it.
They sound so much better with this mix of girls!!! They chose good
Nah this is fire, the mv is lit
This video is 🔥 Love from Odisha, India ❤
That's how indian r real rulers

There might not be many haters and xenophobes in this comment section and let's keep it that way. A certain post on Instagram is making me into a keyboard warrior to hit them with facts. I won't waste anymore time I said what needed to be said and I will stand back and let them get That Karma.

Im excited their performance is at 12:05 am for me, Lumina find out when it airs for you. Remember its on inkgayo YouTube channel!!
Não tô querendo dar uma de hater, mesmo porque gosto do BlackSwan, mas...isso não tá mais pra um pop indiano do que um k-pop? Achei legal ter a cultura da Índia representada, mas pelo que eu observei, não apareceu nada da cultura coreana aí, por isso parece que não é mais k-pop, e sim outro tipo de gênero musical. Nem venham com militância pois não estou criticando, e sim fazendo uma observação!
BlackSwan fighting!
1:35 um dos meu vários surtos foi isso aqui. Perfeita, brilha mesmo rainha

Blackswuan ñ é o msm sem a leia
It’s Odisha 🎉 Yo yo
Let's make it 1M please 🙏
I am NOT a K-pop fan but this group could change my mind. And while not a fan, I do pay attention to the genre. I much prefer this iteration of BLACKSWAN. It looks more cohesive and everyone in the group gets to shine. I definitely LOVE this video. This is cultural appreciation done right. We get to see so many interesting facets of India and it's respectful. And given that colorism is (unfortunately) prevalent in India, it was great to see dark-skinned Indian women and girls featured. Fatou is so pretty and she deserves camera people who actually know how to properly light Black skin tones without washing her out. I've seen a lot of early videos and that's always bugged me. I hope she's got a Black MUA and hair stylist too.
Let's continue to stream hard luminas
Come on everyone let's make this 1M before their Inkigayo performance ❤ They will be so happy 😊
Very close to 1 million stream lumina ❤🎉🎉
I think this MV is shot in Odisha, India, the place from where Sriya belongs. ❤️❤️

I had never heard a Black swan song before and this one is gorgeous! As someone from Odisha whose culture is one of the least represented even in Indian cinema or songs, the fact that this one is entirely shot in my state makes me so proud. The realistic background and the places, this video has my heart. Kpop is truly becoming a global sensation and I am here for it!
Vaya el vídeo está efectivo full ❤❤❤
Esse é o ponto de partida dessas meninas!🎉 Ficou top Musica chiclete Gabi só no close Dança maneira Tem rap ❤❤❤❤
Este grupo me atrapó desde el primer minuto que comencé a reproducir karma nunca me había gustado escuchar los comeback de otros grupos porque aveces no me llegaban a gustar y si me llegaron a gustar es porque lo escuchaba siempre en tiktok pero KARMA ES LO MÁXIMO NO PUEDO PARAR DE ESCUCHARLO  AMO A BLACKSWAN ♡♡♡

Gostei 👏🏼
Really really really loving this comeback
Buen trabajo chicas!!

Ok I see y’all 🙌👍👏💕 this is SMOKING HOT 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️👏👏👏👏❤️
MEU DEUS, FICOU INCRIVEL EU AMEI!!!!!
Wooooow so cool❤
THATS A M A Z I N G OVER WHAT I EXPECTED
They really stepped up their games. Especially the agency. The quality, video effects, choreo, the song and the beat. It’s sooooo good and I hope they’ll stay on this path cause they’ll be going places. I used to follow them before the new line up and kept following from far thanks to Fatou but i think i’ll stan for real. I never actually felt like they were a kpop group before, for many different reasons, the first one being the quality of what the agency produced for them. Now to me they’re kpop artists, and they can finally shine properly.
Podre
wheres leia?
Okay we are almost at 1 million great job guys
Everyone vote in star planet
This is soo good😭😭🤌🤌🤌
I've been waiting for you without noticing that 🔥 I'm so happy that you came back...the MV is perfect❤ I wish you well😍

The rest are so skinny while her is soo fat . She does not fit with the other beautiful girls
I’m very surprised. I’ve liked black swan but this is probably their best song, reason being because this is one of the only songs that fit their vocal range, has a good beat, and is just very pleasing to listen. ❤️❤️  This is my opinion, if you agree or disagree… respect it please and thank you

this is kpop?
WOW Was crying while watching this I will always support and love u ❤❤❤
Love it👌🏾😘
*Useless* 😂
This is very diff from their previous songs which is good,  if they release more diverse songs which represents every members country and culture this will benefit them, might as well transitions them as a global group... it's risky but I'm sure it's worth it.
Let's go luminas to 1 million
A kpop group that doesn't have a korean girl, how ironic. I'll try to give BlackSwan one more chance...
Cara eu amei de verdade a música
They did so well !
1 MILLION SOON !!!!
Fatou u killed❤😊
This song makes me so happy
Brrrr tatata
Wasn't bad but it felt too much like a blackpink wannabe song.
THIS is how you explore a culture while respecting its boundaries. THIS is how you do representation
Tiembla Baby Moster, esto es bellisimo!!!
This MV is everything. Go Black 🦢
Fantastic❤❤❤❤❤
حلوه الاغنيه
Este video honestamente merece más atención. No fueron estudios, son escenarios reales la compañía y las chicas se esforzaron realmente para este bello resultado.😊

Uma empresa construída apenas por pessoas com TDAH sem tratamento, única explicação para serem tão brilhantes e mesmo assim não conseguirem executar bem o plano.
I'm proud of you Shriya beta..... this is our culture..
Amazing!!! 💖💖💖

Beautiful

THEY'RE LOOKING GOOD ㅠㅠ
No, cuz this is by far BlackSwans best song/comeback. The quality is amazing!!!!
Okkkkk SLAYYYYY
Lol I'm so confuse like I thought they were 2 new member with Fatou and Lea. And 2 new girls, and I feel like it's another two new girls plus one and Lea is out lol. This label is a joke at this point I guess Rania will suffer from the Rania legacy for sure
Loved everything
Its been so long since i've seen mvs that are actually shot in realistic backgroungs. No green screen, no cgi, no glamourised sets, just natural BGs. Well done! Loved the cultural appreciation. As an Indian, it makes me proud. ♡
Congratulations, girls ❤
Cade a LEIA??
The comments are slowing down😭
Gooo 900k
They ate that fr ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️💕
THE BRIDGEEE
최고의 컴백이다!! 블랙스완을 널리 알리자!!!❤️

Fofas
So proud to see kpop MV being shoot in INDIA
nah cause why is this the best song they have put out so far
Estou com um Leve pressentimento que se esse MV ter resultados bons eles vão descartar a Leia 😢😢😢😢😢💔💔💔 N FASSA ISSO PFV RMusic POR FAVOR, Brasil quer a volta de Leia ❤🇧🇷
Army, are you here ?
Karma is on 🔥 and everywhere ❤❤
acabou pra vc aespa
I love u blackswan
WOW
Ainda acho estranho não ter nenhuma coreana num grupo de Kpop, mas a música é boa
song is really nice
❣️❣️❤️❤️just perfect 😺😊
Karma KILLS! I fucking love everything about this
why don't they pronounce hana properely?song is good though.Hairstyles and outfits could have been better.
Viciada no vocal da Gabi, maravilhosa!! <3
Black Swan has found their niche and are killing it!
Best M/V ever. Loved it so much that❤❤❤ im literally addicted to it❤❤
they have really good vocals omgosh!!
O comeback me surpreendeu demais ,  sinto falta da leia e principalmente de um perfil coreana por se trata de kpop , desejo sucesso para meninas .
Ate 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤
Nah this keep getting better and better 😮‍💨🌹❤
me encanto..... si quieren que suba las vistas, busquen el video manual y con la calidad mas o igual de 720, sin cambiar los anuncios y no pausar, y después se van a mirar otros 4 o 5 videos diferentes para dejar pasar y se vuelven a buscar el video otras vez manualmente...
And 1M
Lets go luminas 900k
IN-CROYABLE
O mais triste, é saber que a Leia está em hiatus, até que o maldito contrato acabe pra ela ser livre, e usar suas redes  livremente, mas até acabar ela ta impedida de usar, essa empresa é o cão, deixou ela em hiatus enquanto a nova formação brilha.  Saudades do verdadeiro Blackswan 2020
Was this video sponsored by videocon d2h ?
im not even gonna lie, this is a bop.
Kpop need taking lessons from this mv
Stream Karma!!!
🙂I am blown away 💞💞💞💞🥺🥺
Wow
This is how you open kpop to the world!
My favorite kpop mv 🔥🔥🔥🔥
As an Indian, I really feel so proud to see this way of representing Indian culture. Every single scene has got it's own cultural significance portraying the diversified preferences in Indian culture, featuring different kinds of dances, monuments, people belonging to different communities and so on. Gotta appreciate their unique idea of appreciating Indian culture in a kpop song/mv. One of the most powerful comebacks in the kpop history, should admit! Should thank them from deep inside the heart for this work of art!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
WoW ❤❤❤
bro fato deserves a new group .
I’m very very very love it❤❤❤
BEAUTIFUL :)
Bop!
Lets 1M
Damn bruh as a person from odisha...it's a really unknown state kinda n recently it's been developing really well...I'm so proud of all these references and acknowledgments...go girlies show them watchu got!

Que comeback perfeito, simplesmente tombou todo mundo

Everything is good for me , but i don't know who the heck did lighting at the specially in that old building it's nort working they need something dark there and light should been from side and back not on their face and above. I didn't like some parts from the starting. A light master was needed their 😢😑.

Cade o kpop?
FINALLY! SOME INDIAN REPRESENTATION! This is so beautiful, I had tears in my eyes watching this video. For years now I have also been auditioning, hoping someone from India will help our beautiful culture being represented in the Kpop industry and I cannot be any more proud than I already am of the Blackswan girls!!! I pray and wish all the girls a healthy and successful career ahead!! 💝💝
Let's do 1M views in one week 🎉
My god Gabi's voice gave me chills through entire song. I like tha bold voice though. And all these members did very stunning music. I think this different and unique. This caught my eyes. (Like other kpop groups one of steals the or copies the song, music, etc) But in terms of this they didn't, I've great respect for this group fro being honest everytime and hardwork. I hope they'll always get at first place.  Support them people! I'm with you blackswan all time.
Blackswan 10/10
some people will say here that dancing In front of temples in these clothes will leave bad impression but song was good
Lumina we're flying through the 700k mark, 800k here we come!!!

There’s something so beautiful about this mix of cultures.
In India #10 It is woaoa
As someone from Odisha and as an odishi dancer , I never ever thought that I'll get to see  Dhauli and other monuments from Odisha and our odissi dance featured  in a K-pop mv .  It's surprising but in a good way! Sriyaa out there is actually making her homeland proud fr. I'm so proud of Blackswan! All the members did greatt job! The mv , the costumes everything ❤  Thankyouu to all the members and crew for their harwork and dedication in the making of mv and song ! Really proud of ya'll!
India #10
indian no 10
sooooo Onde vota
Onde vota nessas deusas?????
seriously I can't understand the reason for so many criticisms, yes the company can be bad, but the girls are not to blame for anything. people nowadays want to find an excuse to criticize a group for not having anything to do, girls are talented and go far I'm not part of a fandom and I'm not an obsessed fan type I'm respectful, I know my limit and that I shouldn't go beyond the personal lives of artists so respect the girls they go far I wish them the best.
Woww!! 💗
dude look at them they are soo good and the dance,the vocals and the visuals are soo LIT and specially how they added indian culture 'THEY ARE AWESOME'.

STAN BLACKSWAN
I'm an army and on top of that I'm an indian but choose this to watch because I like them . We should appreciate every good song no matter which group you stan. Even though I don't know much about blackswan but I got to know them because of sriya ( and the reason I showed intrest in her for the first time was because she have the same name as me and I was like.. "Even though I couldn't even go to Korea atleast someone of the same name similar to my name is there experiencing Korea, kpop, kfood etc "😅
1M view is comming soon girlss .within 1 day we almost reached 700k view 🙈🥰

I was looking for a K-pop group that had non Asian women and that’s how I found this group. I don’t get the hate about them. They’re all beautiful, talented and I really like this song. I wish Black Swan the best career and future!
I like this! They’re voices are so pretty, and rappers voices hit you with a “Bam!” It’s fun and catchy like KDA music! ❤ great job everyone! And producers too 😊 can’t wait for the dance practice videos too

Road to 1M...let's gooo!
Blackswan deixou de ser kpop, pra ser só pop. Já que nãotem mais nenhuma coreana no grupo.
Blowed up
Gabi's beauty is impressive, I just missed her voice
2:52 love this part
Um lixo mds
Wow, I Love this! The MV is so interesting and good, also the song is so ear catchy.. I hope in the future I can see blackswan to make MVs with the culture of each of the other members, it will be very interesting!
Música legalzinha mais é louco pensar que em 3 comeback das 5 membros da formação original só restou uma e chegou outras 3 deveriam mudar o nome do grupo
The MV was Stunning
Pior que tá 👍 mesmo
now i’m completely obsessed. i was getting so tired of the constant lineup changes that Rania/BLACKSWAN kept going through. this song is out of this world and i’m praying that these girls stay permanently and give BLACKSWAN the worldwide recognition that they deserve! ❤️
LOVE IT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Omg this is soo amazing, so good, so sophisticated
A dr music tem diversos defeitos, mas eles sabem fazer músicas muito boas. Muito sucesso pras meninas! ❤️❤️
راب فاتو يفووووز 😾❤️‍🔥
يخي الفرقة أصواتهم تفوز 😩💘
It shooting in Odisha,india
Their best song and MV yet!!
ive listened to this like 10 times back to back 😭.. already learned the dance and EVERYTHING. this slaps SO HARD for NO reason OMGGG
Come on Lumina, come on we can reach 1M
Nossaa, a música tá crescendo dms
Lol again typical video showing India like BBC😂😂😂
I love Blackswan ❤❤❤❤❤ mv is awesome
This song is amazing . I like it .🥰
Ngl, this is one of my favorite MV. Loved every bit of it.. the cinematography , the visual, the music, the outfit, dance moves, odissi dance, everything.... For me, the wow part is that they show the diversity of our Indian culture so gracefully, and the lyrics were so good. Well, now I can flex that "KARMA" by "BLACKSWAN" MV was shot in my home state, Odisha, India. :D  I'm glad to see Sriya, Nvee & Gabi marked her K-Pop debut. Fatou 언니, you're the best rapper. ^^ We're rooting for every member. :)  BLACKSWAN, HWAITING!!! ^^   Lots of love from India. <3 <3 <3 <3
0:56 man fatou rap and deep voice
vcs ainda vão longe meninas

❤❤❤❤ loved it
This is their best song and comeback but I still cannot fully commit to them with all the changes they constantly have :(
They are so amazing . Very beautiful really . ❤
Amazing song. Happy Leah is gone, but I'm worried... I cant see koreans liking a group without a korean member, their pronunciation isnt the best as well. Unfortunately I cant see their International fan base keeping them out of the water and actually buying stuff to support them.
SERVED 😍
Julgaram tanto e morderam a língua! Está muito bom eu amei ♡ BLACKSWAN volte para nós
My desi queen Syria

Awesome! Blackswan!
This comeback ❤❤
Awesome MV❤
As an Indian, I'm proud and happy that they didn't opt for showing an overglamorised/ western mixed india but actually went through our streets and showed the traditional side of India.  I dare anyone say this is cultural appropriation, this is cultural appreciation.
Não vou mentir, eu amei a música kkkk

THEY ATE
kapila kusha
очень даже хорошо , но они не добьются большого успеха в кпоп индустрии если в группе нет корейцев и это факт 🤷🏼‍♀️
this song is really amazing! Im from India myself and I love how they appreciate india's culture :)
Gabi is so pretty and beautiful
Shreya is our pride 😊 Love from Odhisha ❤ Jay Jaganath 🙏
Omegada is a great song
The mv 💝🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶💖💖💖
Eu N tava dando nada pra essa música pra minha surpresa amei de mais ❤❤❤❤❤
It's a Bop
So badddd
Rappnya fatou terdengar sangat keren
파토우? 이분 한국어 발음 너무 좋다 짱멋있어요
Considering how non of them are Korean, imagine how better they could be in a multinational group singing in English instead of Korean. Alena is American (1999), Leia is Brazilian-Japanese (2001), Gabi is Brazilian-German (2002), Sriya is Indian (2003) while Fatou is Senegalese-Belgian (1995).  Four of them are still young and if they sign with a English company, they could get better treatment. The company isn’t paying them and i don’t know if Dr is paying their working visa in Korea.
Let's get them to 1 million by the end of the second day.  I think it's durable.
The mv  itself is amazing ,the looks are very beautiful, showing culture.but the teasers weren't cool it looked like the MV was terrible.BLACKSWAN DELIVERED A LOLO🌹🌹
Ooooooooooooooo that is what I wanted 😮
Love from India
oh my god this is amazing
Killed it❤❤ so proud of you guys
What a song tatata 💜 really loving it sooo much and the work on the idols and their team is soooo great proud of you sooooo much 👍🏻
Amei os visuais das meninas 😍😍😍😍💗💗💗💗💗
Wow, this track is definitely memorable for its beats and chorus. I love that the girls are great at revealing their uniqueness in this video, incredible views, great choreography, everything is on top! I'll be watching for new tracks! 😊

As a music lover. I really like this song.  Actually, I just discovered them yesterday because of this song, it just appeared on my YT. With all the music in the industry and all of music i've heard, this song is different to hear and its different from others that they are all the same sound, style, genre, or any other style of music. That's why this song hits me different vibes! <3

This is my first time watching them and I came to watch them simply because I heard in twitter that they have involved Indian culture in their upcoming MV .I am Indian and I enjoyed this much .This is a perfect example of cultural appreciation.
The song though… SO GOODDDDDD
The clothes are so good and it looked more good with the tropical weather of India  ,I love how the combined traditional jewelery to the clothes they wored and it was awesome how they go well with eachother and represent everything love u guys touch success u all❤

It's really amazing and all the girls looks so pretty and their song is bang on  As an Indian it feels soooo good to see that they shoot it in India and also show some of our country and culture
I really like how they represent Indian culture but at the same time M so sad like nowadays in India there are lots of beautiful places to shoot than those auto n cow area they r showing n also I expected them to wear more beautiful Indian dress that is fashionable n elegant...which is really available .... I really expected to be like that ... Because it's going to be spread globally
Desejo todo reconhecimento do mundo pra vcsssss❤❤❤

Sawing all Indian vibes just awesome 💜
Damnnn this was beautiful and fire like bruh wah
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Bro it represent Indian culture with Indian idol and its so unique. Indians lets support this group and show our country power.

the song is nice and everything is fine but if this concept was done by some other K-pop groups or idol who doesn't have Indian members they would have definitely gotten backlash
give them Mama award already

This is the real pop song  i am proud to say i am Indian

Elas são realmente talentosas e até difícil de acreditar que em uma empresa tão desorganizada exista pessoas tão boas assim ,elas voltaram mais vai ser como sempre daqui a pouco tempo elas somem uma membro e excluída do grupo e elas retornam com outra pessoa nova pro grupo kkk.
what a beautiful MV! great settings
Uf temazo

This comeback slays. New faces. New flavors! Love it. Slay Queens!
1:39 that advisement tho in the back ground in odia ....❤️😹
I'm happy to see India in this song but this kpop song doesn't feel like a kpop song. Kpop is losing its essence. What was the need to shoot it in India & make those girls wear Indian jewelry & outfit?🤦🏻‍♀️ Please let kpop be kpop.
This mv is just so goooooooooddddddddddddd ❤❤
But it's only some part of India I would have appreciated more if there was more parts of India But it's good
ME ENCANTO 🤩🤩🤩👌❤❤❤
Perfect mv loved it ....❤️where everyone is perfect and dance vocal visual rap everything is beautiful to hear and the melody god damn u guys are so good 😊❤️ love from West Bengal India 🥺❤️
Loved it 🥰👍🔥
We really needed this❤❤❤ thankyou blackswan for showing Indian culture the real one....
I'm from Odisha and I'm so proud of sriya. Seriously I am so happy to see her.This mv is so good 😍 they did a great job.
Ok this is insane!! Well done guysss so proud❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow ❤❤❤ Superb 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
When everyone hate this group, hm not everyone i mean, just like a few haters, i'm very appreciate this group, how they bring the culture into music video, how they can make a good music, with this genre, and of course how the members can shine well in every scene in this music video, so i'm so excited for blackswan in the future!
The MV is fabulous....if you could just add subtitles please it would be amazingggg
THEY ATE
I have no words to describe this fabulous song , ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hoping for consistency now, both in uploads and lineup, this was a refreshing concept which doesn’t seem disrespectful at an outside viewer’s glance (not indian so can’t say for sure) and seems overall impressive 👏🏿
Being an Indian, and more specifically an odia I feel so freaking proud of these girls. They are super talented and as you can tell by the mv, very respectful towards cultures other than their own. Kudos to the producer, director and the company as well!
Ohh goshhh i am really shocked when I saw it was shooted in India mannnnnn😫😫😫😩😩😩😩😩❤❤
Now I'm damn sure they will be famous THEBLACKSWAN🖤🦢
2:52 THIS PART!!! SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL
✌👍👍♥️

Superb ❤

1:09 she looks a cute girl who is trying to act badass.... She is just cute and i must say the chorus is my fav.... I hope it becomes a dance trend soon... Coz this chorus has a lot of potential
Black Swan literally outdo half of the gen 4 group song rn😩‼️
Is this a kpop group or indiapop group i cant tell

뮤비 촬영 누가 했지. 아니 노래랑 뮤비가 너무 동떨어짐. 색감이 이렇게 다채롭고 의상도 컬러풀한데 카메라 무빙이나 화면 구도가 너무 평면이라 뮤비자체 임팩트가 떨어짐;;  노래좋고 의상도 잘 골라놓고 뮤비가 왜....
Wahhhhh❤❤❤❤
então né...
This video is shoot in odisha india...
Wow very nice song I love this😍😍😍
Let's make it to 1 million in 24 hours
we have reached our goal for 500 M! Lets go for  700
great
Come around
What a GORGEOUS music video, the scenery is so majestic!!! I'll be honest, I was sad that two members left and one is on health hiatus, but Fatou and the new girls are eating! Big welcome to Gabi, Sriya, and Nvee!!!
Awesome 👏🏻 ❤❤❤❤
This is very unique than other kpop songs.... Wow its amazing👌👌
I honestly wish they just re-debut instead of using Blackswan as their name. Like instead of just focusing on the kpop industry, they should do like what XG does, become an international group instead. They’d dominate ts so bad bc look at the beautiful cultures each members bring to the group! I want them to succeed sooooo bad and it’s not happening with them just focusing on SK’s media.
Me encanta todooooo💖💖💖
Awesome❤❤
Woahhhh this is soo good like i don't have words umm.. just slayy girls ❤
Our Indian culture
Thank you choosing Bhubaneswar for this song scene shoot
I have never seen or heard any Black Swan songs/mvs, but wow am I glad I saw this one!! How unique is this group! I hope all the success for them 💖

My musical taste, after Blackpink, they are the best. It is a group that has a differentiated identity. Not to mention the richness of culture. I loved the costumes, the cuts and the vocals are impeccable.

Ficou perfeito!
Such a good comeback 🤗. Lots of love from India 🇮🇳.
These guys shut everyone's f*ckin mouth off.....
Love all
한국인들은 kpop에 한국인이 있든 없든 상관하지 않아요~ ㅎㅎ 그냥 인종이 다양해서 신선해서 좋고 음악이 좋으면 좋은거고, kpop 파이 넓혀줘서 고마울 뿐입니다. 다만 소속사가 여러번 아이돌그룹 실패의 역사가 있고 그때마다 가차없이 기존 아이돌들을 버렸기 때문에 소속사로부터 제대로 대우받기를 바랄뿐입니다. 솔직히 이번 노래가 너무 잘나왔고 자체예능 콘텐츠 컬리티 수준만 높이면 분명히 성공할 수 있을거 같은데~ 정산 잘해 주시길 바랍니다.
I really loved it ❤
This song slaps
Hey.... Thnaks for sharing our culture ❤
Not a fan and I’m new here. I just saw them earlier on tiktok and I decided to watch it here in yt. It’s so good, I like it so much 💕🧺
Very good music video waiting to see you on all again. Fatou i love you your rap omg. Nvee   omg your voice too good fluent in Korean and doing that tatatat   you totally won by heart .Sriya and Gabi your voices blend together very well it sounds like heaven.  You all are pricelesss.  This group should go ahed . Don't underestimate power of DR music . Best MV I've ever seen .

Sim, essas garotas estão na moda! Eles merecem muito isso. O talento deles é incrível e todos brilham. O MV é bem filmado e mostra a beleza da Índia. Esta é uma apreciação cultural perfeita e você pode dizer que eles têm muito amor e respeito. É assim que a diversidade ❤ Sou fã desde o início e sinto falta dos membros antigos, mas Gabbi NVee e Sriya se dão tão bem e trabalham tão bem juntos como um grupo com fatou. Envio amor e espero que tenham o reconhecimento que merecem, cisne negro!❤👏👏👏

sriya is so beautiful
Công nhận là Gabi đẹp thật á
I think they would find more success if they promoted more as a global group like XG cause honestly this doesn't even feel like kpop. It's a great song, but they will always get hate singing in Korean tbh.
Cày view để lên 1 triệu views nào, hay quá các chế ơi các chế rất cố gắng và hoàn toàn xứng đáng để nhận được thành công
Gabi Killed It! ❤
