I love this kind of music videos!!

Go white girl, rip da flo
This is such a banger - why are you not mainstream?
The real girl power anthem 🎉
I like hiM🫦💅🤤
Song name pls  ?
When we do it we’re hoes when men do it, it’s acceptable because boys will be boys.
i’m here from I know you did last summer. They actually only use the 15 seconds of this song that’s even remotely considered good.
The first one looks like nimare the footballer player
here after watching the squid games, because I like them all
That's what I sing when I see bts
How single life feels like :
🌐🔮🎉
What the hell happened from “Tom boy” to now!? I’m just discovering this… NGL, I love her back then, she was her own little creative soul and had the energy. I’m not feeling this look nor sound. still love her though
Yaassss
Yuhhh
Love this! ❤
clever cute cosmic
India wale ❤🇮🇳
So which one came first? Black Mirror or her for that alternative reality thingy by the temples?
Hmm this sounds familiar 🚱🔠🔤
this song sounds familiar
Hmn interesting ❤
this chick is as hot as absolute zero
Yep I'm in the 2025 squat still vibing💃🏾
It makes me sad how we don’t talk about this song anymore bc it was so iconic
🔥🔥🔥
Blue and white Mohawk crest Crayola clowns
I respect my Asian brothers Facts... Shem.....
Like if you watching this in 2025 and still sounds fire!
🔐
1:12 THIS MANNNN🔥🔥🔥🔥
If you ever get played by a bitch, play this song to her and see how she acts! Probably she will dance and mocks you.
Me choosing squid game actors:
She has very good taste in men 🔥
So who stole who's style because I'm getting latto vibes😂
She giving me blu Cantrell vibes❤
💜
Bring this bih back
She disappeared like Nokia
sounds familiar huh
does that sound familiar to you?
Beat is corny sounds like another persons song. Don’t get the hype with the men in the video seemed very normal for this day and age. Lyrics were ok and her performance was good. Not going crazy over it though. Not much original about it and she got her boobs done 👎
She reminds me about Blu Cantrell... Good stuff...2025 🔥
u are literally so perfect
I came across this song idkh but I’m feeling it. Idk who she is but I like it
This crap is so evil.
Snotty nose red kids brought me here 👌🏾 love her song
Okay I do like this song. I downloaded it but then I came and watched this video and I just wanna be honest for a second… you tried way too hard to be sexy and it didn’t work. You look awkward. Very pretty but maybe try and be more natural with your sexiness and not try so hard cause a couple times I actually got second hand embarrassment watching you dance or walk or make seductive faces. Just let it flow like an instinct not a porn star.
does this sound familiar to u?
1:12 damn man, he's so f beautiful
This sound familiar Dublin
Anyone else getting Blu Cantrell vibes
🤿💞🎖️💋
I HATE SEEING MEN DOING WOMEN'S HAIR.
Someone in 2025❤
Why am I just hearing this song 😂.. Shit lit 🔥 🔥
I'm 4 years late 🔥🔥🔥. First time hearing the whole song I heard a lil of it on fb on someone else video
Does she have a thing for small time Latvian gangsters or something? Do you I guess 🤷🏻‍♂️
You suck

Haw suggestive you want it to be ?  Yes   I can't believe it's so digestive i can't watch (without any too suggestive actions)but i can't explain haw much i love it first time finally a woman is not only obsessed one men when she's talking about hesr sexuality but have so many different men around her that she finds attractive other wise it's only men (male songs movies) who are surrounded by so many women it's actually more deeper and important then it seems I'm so glad I want more like this
like him Like him too He my man He my boo He my type He's so cute I want him And want him too I like him Like him too He my man He my boo He my type He's so cute I want him And want him too Hop in the whip Hop in the truck I do whatever the fuck that I want I'm not a hoe I'm not a slut I like to fuck and I sure like to suck I am that bold Freezy like ice I'm not a wife so talk to me nice You ain't my type I don't like you You a broke boy, look at your shoes I'm the player And I am the pimp All of them boys, make 'em the trick All of them boys, they on my shit But all them boys, they make me sick I do not see you taming me 'Less them there entertaining me They just tryna p-play with me Play with me, you gon' pay the fee I like him Like him too He my man He my boo He my type He's so cute I want him And want him too I like him Like him too He my man He my boo He my type He's so cute I want him And want him too Dibble in this, and dibble in that Get all his head like I am a brat Play with his balls when he up to bat Make daddy real proud like I'm Kyla Pratt I'm taking a shower, he making the bed When I leave the city, I leave him on read Go get the next, like I get the bread He coming with questions, I call him the feds He let me plead the fifth 'Cause he know this box a gift Eating breakfast not a Tiff' When I curve him, he get stiff I go beast mode Ball like free throw Game like cheat code Pounds like kilo I like him Like him too He my man He my boo He my type He's so cute I want him And want him too I like him Like him too He my man He my boo He my type He's so cute I want him And want him too I do not see you taming me 'Less them there entertaining me They just tryna p-play with me Play with me, you gon' pay the fee Traducir al español

I like him❤
LETS BRING THIS LEGEND BACK !! ITS 2024 🎉!!
does this sound familiar
So y’all ever wanna steal a song and try to get attention
Girls when they're on Character AI or Janitor AI
what a horrible beat!
Hear countless songs by male artists rapping about how they turn girls into their hoes and all of the dirty perverted stuff they do to them. Repeatedly say they don’t want a wife to tie them down and just want to get freaky and have fun.   Men: Wow this is a bop.   Hear one song by a female who raps about the same exact thing.   Men: I’m fucking outraged   Gotta love male hypocrisy 😂😬 Y’all are some confusing creatures.
Don't follow here and tell I tell you I found her first... Wayyz back
Sad to see young people being used by Satan.

Good lord, all these fine menses
Dr. Dre at an industry party in 1992 ... beat the sh*t out of a VJ and writer for Rap Masters magazine. Her name was DEE BARNS. Him and his security guard dragged her into a bathroom stall. Because she wrote a negative peice about NWA they beat her like a man & sexually assaulted her. NO ONE AT THE PARTY HELPED HER!!! And it amazes me how a generation so concerned with activism and #metoo and BLM continue to support him and make him a billionaire by buying his shitty headphones. I have no respect for Princess Nokia anymore. The reason why I came on YouTube was seeing her promote an organization for feminist safe spaces. What a hypocrite taking money from BEATS to promote the company.
I love it finally a women with bunch of hot men by her it’s about time!!!!!
I want a bi version now
Love this song beats are fire 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Braba 🔥🔥
And not one of them will marry her bc they know better 😂😊
Ariana Grande copying this? 😂😂
Not ariana copying this queen🤍
Your a prostitute.
She sings like Ice Spice omgg😭

Damn. Your music sucks. Claim to be a feminist but yet you no different than any other shit female rapper.
He sight 🤪🥵🥵🥵🥶
She deserves more attention.. Dude!..she is killing! Listen this on. 1.25 playback spped.. It hits well
It didn't blow my mind, unfortunately, but it's terrible, trivial, prosaic and primitive shit.
That first guy though. Omg!
THE OCEAN GATE BAR OH MY GOSH😂😂😂😂
Messed up concept yuck but that asian boy at the end tho 👀 I'll give you that.
ONE HIT WONDER
Anyone from Beatstar prepatch still come to get PTSD?

When im out the city. I leave them on read. ❤🤷🏽‍♀️💯
This is a really nice video

This is Cardi stye. Yet she claimed Ariana stole her sound???  I'm confused. She's mediocre.
SHE WAS MUCH BIGGER HERE. THE INDUSTRY PUT HER ON A DIET
Does that sound familiar
Mom
For all the ladies that want a "I like her" see this:  https://youtu.be/pTiDBK6R3kE?si=m3e_SLZYptODAGwI  Big Mo Bitw - Like Her (Princess Nokia Cover)  She makes a cover of this exact song and it fucking slaps. Hope y'all find it
Those thicker latino men... OMGG
This kinda sounds like WAP, right? ;)
🔥🔥🔥🔥. She can't dance to save her life tho lol
The way being a whore is praised is so confusing.
eu com meus tipos ideais:
Is she a transgender?
this sounds familiar
Now I have got a song to listen while I am crushing on all those K-celebs!
Sooo good
Who is the first guy?

https://youtu.be/8lWXKn3Mqec?si=5oWd4Tzqz_rQNcLo

I LuvLove Princess Nokia She’s A Great 😊 🥰 Artist

They are all men of color. That's nice.
Tech humanism and reptilian eyes…illuminati all up in this- how’s the deal with the Devil going?
Her type = Ex cons and wannabe g's.
Claims to not be a ho but writes a song about sleeping around. Well shit, and here i thought i knew what a ho was 🤔
I want HER❤❤❤❤😂
🇲🇽🇲🇽😎
I get Cardi B vibes I think it's the soundtrack
😮🥵😅 2:17 I'd try that man too
With k-pop idols 😂
ㅂ
Princess Nokia should make songs with Nels the Don. Pretty bitch hanging with bitches that's always lit.
This is my way when I watching k-drama 😂I fall in love with all actor's
I'm watching this video for the gazillion squillionth time and I'm just realizing the men were AI's and it was a Virtual Reality game 😄
Copy of romanian song

You are going to get some hurt I understand people who ask questions offend you cause you are trying to forget, but go one whole year without asking a single question.
I have love for you genuine love
Yeah she’s definitely confident because personally I wouldn’t be able to walk by so many fine men without feeling nervous haaha
I love how she uses an old school windows computer with futuristic virtual reality equipment
Finally a Female rap song not shitting on men

I couldn't stop thinking bout this song everytime I think bout how sexy colson baker is 😍😍😍😍
The actual disrespect people tried to play on TikTok was funny. Talking about they didn’t know who Princess Nokia was like they weren’t just jamming to the song to the new trendiest dance 😅
Make Daddy Real Proud,Like I'm Kyla Pratt.🎉🎉🎉🎉
Who's the first guy in the tracksuit. He's so cute
PRINCESS NOKIA ATE THAT SHIT UP
I love you I’m from Russia ❤and I love you too ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
I thought this was cardi B when I heard this in one of the shorts
Yes.
I just wanna know who is the talk light skin dude I need his IG ASAP
Who like the end more ...! Bang bang 🥵
Boss.
HOW THE HECK DOES SHE ONLY HAVE 555K SUBS omfg she's so underrated
love it, but all that trust she has with that top at  the first scene
Wtf is this why would one take a shower by themselves whilst his one tie soulmate makes the bed SEPARATELY WHY NOT do every single activity and chore and work TOGETHER
I’ve never even whined on the love of my life yet
Why does this only have 16m views
I love those jacked dad bods  😮‍💨❤️
2:35 damnnn sooooo hottttttt
Where do you buy this perfume?😊

This song could have been my anthem in my twenties. Love this girl. Well done 👏🏽👏🏽
Damn  girl....I  like him too share! 😜
AYO BUT DROP THE NAMES AND IG LOOKS FOR THESE MEN GODDAMN
Notice at the end it was all in virtual reality… lol that’s the meta verses goal
It kills me how she recreates parts of olds Jlo's videos
she's so real, finally a harem for the girlies
S2E1 of Harlem brought me here.
2023: THIS SHIT STILL SLAPS ! 🔥
This music video is trash lmfao
T'es belle
as a bi man this video is my religion
.
I’ve been on a mission trying to find female rappers without ghost writers…. Ima be honest this some elementary abc type stuff. There hasn’t been a fire female rapper (with or without Ghost writers) since Nikki and she don’t even have ghost writers. This sad. Doja cat is in the race but even then she isn’t specifically a rapper she more of an artist all around
Я придумала шутку...  Мужики дефолт-модельки, для качества надо покупать премиум

Luv her 💓 💕 💗 💖 ❤

Très belle chanson Masallah 🇹🇷❤🇩🇿

Loved seeing your song on  Reservation Dogs!!!! As a Native women, yassss love ya!!!
Dumbest video ever! I liked the song - heard it on reservation dogs - but her trying to dance and then wearing some outfits she really shouldn't have threw me a little off of the video. Dancing is not her strength so just shouldn't until she takes some classes. Her whine looked like she was drunk and didn't have control of her hips...just no.
Did a mashup of this and Rain by Aitch and AJ Tracey would love if you could check it out ! X https://youtu.be/sjXmlWMF6SI
Let's feat with egy tech rap
My favorite video for sure
The men in this video is so fine, finally a video with some eye candy for us woman to look at.
She did what needed to be done. Facts.🇵🇷🔥🤯😎💃
Reservation Dogs brought me here
I’ve been trying to find this song forever now 😂
Did his hairline change!
LAAAWDY.Get it boo.
This my first PRINCESS NOKIA video and I love how sexy hot she is
Slut song 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
I’ve never seen anyone who reminds me of a My Little Pony more (this is a top tier compliment btw)
I wish I could delete this song from my Beatstar
2:42 😍
This is utter garbage  😂😂
El Evangelio de salvación de nuestras almas: 💜💕💖📖✝️🕎💡💡❤️❤️💞💕💕💕💕💕💕Porque lo que recibí te lo transmití como de [primera importancia]: que Cristo murió por nuestros pecados según las Escrituras, que fue sepultado, que resucitó al tercer día según las Escrituras, y que se apareció a Pedro, y luego a los Doce. Después de eso, se apareció a más de quinientos de los hermanos y hermanas al mismo tiempo,
Thats some next level zen shit standing so calm in that hall of hotties.

Here is my rap..., She's a freak she's a H^^ She's the type that will never say no, Find her in the ally in the trap find her anywhere on her back, She don't care if you in jail or in a frat she will always be down to unwrap, She so lose she so juiced she will be done she eat the fruit..... Dam sign me up

How does it feel to be an MK ultra sex puppet with no freedom? 💀💀💀🤡
Yasss feminine sexual power
Yall...over millions viewed but not a million subscribers to her channel??? That's sacrilege!! Sub her yall!! She's deserves so much more accreditation!!! Xoxo queens!!
Me to all male kpop idols :
And the dudes are soooooo FIINNEEEEE 😍😍😍😍😍
#HOLDYOURPRIDECAM  #IFANDWHENICOMEBACK.
This is a vibe Biiiiiiiitch ❤️
her and bia have similar voices
That 90’s thong throwback
None of them is my type 😂 hundreds of man chasing me, I only like one who doesn't chase me😂
This is my anuties song 😮
Sick how people in this comment section are saying how they like the fact there's a female lead surrounded by a bunch of males, "treating her like a queen"!  Bruh, WTF?!?!?  1️⃣ First off, that's DISGUSTING and gives off gang-rape vibes!  2️⃣ Secondly, how the f*** is she being treated like a queen?!?!?  3️⃣ Thirdly, why does she need/want all those men around her when all she needs is ONE?!?!?
Princess Nokia is so gorgeous 😵‍💫😵‍💫
I am a guy and don’t have a problem with it. If a male rapper can have 50 women in their music videos, why can’t a female rapper with 50 guys? I’m glad that your video has a diversity of different men. I’m a Black man and media has a tendency to put us in one box. We are different shades and body types. And to Princess Nokia, you’re absolutely beautiful!!
This girl deserves much much more!!!
💚💚💚💚💚💚

I only like this song for the “ gotta beat my powers we just made a banger “
the intro is giving me Cassie vibes from her music video long way 2 go and I'm here for it 💖😭

SUCH A GREAT SONG!!!! I LOVE IT. I SING THIS ALL THE TIME LMAOOO <333
She can't dance worth a damn ,but this song and video are lit.
Wait..nobody caught the H20 ringtone in the beginning 😂
That’s billy from Waraq saying we just made a banger
I bet you 50 cent she a virgin
should be used for an Avengers movie amv.
So.... Megan Could NEVA, actual art here.... if Cardi didn't sell her soul, this would be the Epic collaboration.  But Nokia more tale talented than all of them . #hardfacts

interesting song, the title doesn’t say explicit lyrics , it’s has potential to be a better song , but not made for entire family to listen too
new rules vs I like him
Fuck! I'll alwaya be in love with the white guy from the beginning 😍
On this isn't the the same person from the "don't you fuck with my energy" song

So sad what the misogynist music industry did to this talent. I bet they tell her she's in control. The US: pimp of the world.
Type 91823 in your phone and tell me that’s not the number that’s being pushed 😂
This might be the most generic and mediocre shit ever created. It's just butt fr.
WHERE ARE THE PRINCESS SAMSUNG AND PRINCESS IPHONE OR PRINCESS MOTOROLA AND PRINCESS LG?
I'm not a hoe, I'm not a slut.  I like to fuck and I like to suck ....?
Who is this this isn't Nokia she has completely did 360 like girl is trying so hard to be black. And sad part is she got all this Surgery done and now see looks horrible

Would be better without the sound of a phone being dialed
I just found out she was rappin this song bruh I need to catch up
Homegirl def got a little boob job, kinda bummed because she was out here representing the itty bitty committee, but I can’t say I wouldn’t do the same thing if I could afford it! It was just nice to see a beautiful successful women comfortable with her body who has little titties too! Same with Tay Money, but they both enhanced their titties a little & didn’t go too big. I mean I would too :(
Kinda sad that she turned herself into plastic for no reason.
Her previous songs were abaut self confidence and that kind of stuff but she also got a lot of plastic surgeries so i guess that she's not so self cofident.
Me who has a dozen of crushes :....... I like him....like him too
0:33 starts
Lyrics is blunt
🤷‍♂️🔥🔥🔥💰
Show of hands. How many of you are gay guys?
She changed it up from tomboy huh??? Sex sells....

Nokia is the only unique one out here, I hope the industry doesn’t turn her into latto/cardi/saweetie etc they all the same smh
Me when I have to select a bias in NCT :
forget what I said your just a classless bitch why must you say I am broke those air forces costed a couple hundred dollars in one year I have made a lot of money but in business I am making a absolute killing none of it will be yours if I show you respect and you spit in my face your worthless memory I will erase you wont see me giving you any time your making a couple thousand I can make million in one night sometimes a billion if I follow protocol and do things right you asked for it so I broke your talentless ass down respect the crown
It feels like this song is meant just for me
I know
It's totally me when it's come to BTS 😅😅
stabil
She killed this song I literally have this song on repeat
Haha
Its beuty
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sera uma copia de Tiffany ??
https://youtu.be/z5LxXGhz7xE
So, how I interpret the video is that she's *fantasizing* 👅about having sex with anyone she wants. So she's not really a hoe or a slut cuz she's not really fucking them.. however, video aside, that line would be completely contradictive to say the least.
i want a gay version- nvm ill sing it myself later
Every stan on kpop..
This song tortures me on beatstar 😂
this song is soo boring
Does anyone know the name of the guy at 2:12 ? Asking for a friend... 🍭
I like her.
Bruh this is ass, bitch fr thought phone dialling was a good beat 💀
What she sing this
EW THE BALD MAN WASNT EVEN CUTE UGH *breaks up with baldie*
Just like the nokia phone brand, she's now a flopping artist.
That Celine check came through
Why would somebody name herself princess nokia??
2:09 um rato passa correndo
Just another shallow song . Total BS
Uma mudança enorme de cinco anos pra cá!!! Perfeita 😍
Main line's: I like him, Like him too, He my man, He my boo, He my type, He's so cute, I want him, And wanna him too, I like him
I don't have a man but I still love her style in this one ... oh yeah 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

This song is sucks. I dont know, why do people continuing to listen this.  This "gangsta-lovely" rap from girl makes me nothing apart from cringe. Stupid clip about nothing, stupid voiceline with hoarseness. Omg, wtf
Me when I'm at my homophobic parents house for Christmas and Thanksgiving ;-;
Yeesh how do people like this shit
Who is also here from Beatstar?
I thought boys were from Mars? Why u like them?
Отменная порция кала
At this point I'm convinced that I too can look like tons of different people.
This is the hardest song of the beatstar
been listening to princess nokia since biohazard butterfly so happy for her c':
I'm need her to go back to school to become a doctor or lawyer because she sucks at rapping 😒

So ein drecks einfallsloses Lied Schande das man damit Geld verdient
💩💩💩
There's a singer called princess nokia 😂😂😂😂 nice song though
..this song is literally ear murder 😐
As an Asian American, I’m happy to see Asian homies get some decent screen time with the talent. Shout out to the casting agents sharing some of the spotlight we rarely get to see in mainstream media!
Beatstar я полагаю?
Quien más pensó en "moco" del free? 🤣🤣
one of the worst songs of all time on any music genre.
Cool
Any1 catch the "One on One" reference 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Such a SHIT song it  makes me want to puke 🤢
Any army came here after watching bts i like him reels
3:05 i think he is her type
trash
Beatstars músic gooood
I like her type, i want him too😍😍😍😍
When i am single:I like him like him too
Qui est là après avoir jouer ce titre sur beatstar ?
Princess Nokia is beautiful and i dont think shes black fishing whoever came up with that is full of it first of all if theres black fishing theres white fishing and theres alot more white fishing than black fishing. Its all entertainment anyways so why anyone is taking it on a personal level is just rediculas and stupid, it sounds something an insecure or jealous person would claim. And anything thats meant for racially profiling someone just simply needs to stop, enough already , with the racial comments, arent we all just had enough of it yet?? It's not gonna stop if we keep allowing it to go on sooner or later were gonna have to realize if we want change stand up and make change instead of continueing with remarks why not just say enough! Any time you hear someone saying stupid sh** like that , enough!! Instead of the back and forth there trying to be like us and they re jealous of us man get real!!! Who cares!! Let them why be offended take it as a compliment, there trying to look like you ok you should be flattered then, why talk sh** about it?? Why is it a bad thing ?? Theyre mostly entertainers making movies or models doing a shoot its not against the law and ots usually not what people assume anyway. Imagine if everybody would stop assuming. Imagine if people would take a stand instead of participating in racial comments . people wouldnt say them any more.

She hates white people.  Of course, given schlock like this, she may be doing us a favor.
Get some hotter guys. Those are ridiculous to pass off as sexy.

So saddened I just got into her! I’m a superfan now! I listened to every one of her songs and know them word for word! Her music is an escape, she gets what being a loner and a misfit is like. Spirituality and how intune she is with herself is inspirational. Her messages and what she stands for and lets not forget her fucking bars are so lyrical and the way she can switch up her flow, style and her artistry is unparalleled! She’s so raw and hardcore when she starts spitting!!! She’s in my top 3 she’s right behind Snow tha Product and Cupcakke lyrically!!!! She’s a genius!!
She's got that sex appeal, looks like a Barbarella she's got mad game and bring it sis.

whack
“ I like him, like him too, he my man, he my boo” me when I see Harry Potter boys😭
Lol came here from a BTS edit ...
She started as this liberal feminist girl, whatever. What is this? She's so lost. Second hand embarrassment.
Anyone notice the questionable bulge in the blue outfit around whats supposed to be a woman part... definitely not a woman part there.. and he/she refuses to identify... this a man yo
🤨
your pc is unplugged
she was in ashnikko's song slumber party and I had not listened to her years so I did not recognize her so when I saw her I was like hold up
the pansexual vibes this song gives off
I cant wait till October dude holy hdoch2 bo xo w.v skcuq jell s!!!!!!

This is off topic but just encouraging everyone that life is short. Tooo short. It’s so sad that anyone of us reading this right now can here today and gone tomorrow. So please, if you’re reading this, please make it right with Christ (if you didn’t already) because if you miss heaven, you won’t miss hell 🙏✝️ I don’t know you personally but trust me, I want you to make it 🤗 and yes, Christ is recording this exact moment where I’m telling you all of this. So, on judgement day, He’ll replay this exact moment for you and you will have to give an account of your entire life. I really want this account that you’ll have to give to be one where He’s proud of you and He’ll say “well done my good and faithful servant”.
Wow objectifying men
Aapne launde jagha hai??? 😂😂😂

That moment when you're the nicest thing in your house

so we are not gonna talk about that last part
where can i get that HEADSET
vou colocar de toque no meu nokia
oh do me a favor your ridiculous, accuse ariana of having plagiarized that dull little song 😝, there is a lot to do, wanting to climb a career that doesn't even exist on top of ariana grande !!! if you don't get to her feet !!
Um any Dons here that think this whole video looks familiar?? 😍 She gives me Steff vibes, espcially in CAN'T LET YOU GO.
Just 10M 🤔!.
I love how she is surrrounded instead of the guy has like 999,999,999,999,999,999 billion girls surrounding him
She voice similar to cardi B
Am I the only one pointing out when the lyrics go I like him, like him too and so on as if I'm performing at the award shows hahaha
Yum. I would like to try all those guys as well.
I don't even recognize her!
Telling someone that they don’t have a flat stomach and it’s visibly fat??? and will show it and are confident as if they shouldn’t be is an insult she just made a bomb ass song let’s talk about how she’s pretty without “kindly’  insulting someone
Omg... she's so much different now 😭
Princess Nauwisa=2014 Princess Nokia =2020!!!!!

I WISH TO SEE YOU MY SPECIAL  PRINCESS  OF YOUR STYLE IS UNIQUE AS MY PART OF MOONTALK ARTIST

Princess Nokia 3310. Still indestructible and still great!!
Cyberpunk 2077
one thing i love the absolute fuckin most abt this is that she doesn’t have the typical hourglass body that’s so overrated. she has visible fat and curves but she’s so confident and works all her outfits like a bad bitch. she doesn’t have some of the typical “beauty standards”, and yet she wears the clothes and holds herself w so much confidence and self respect that she looks like the most beautiful woman in this video 👏🏽
I came here after Nora Fatehi's roasting Jannat Zubair 😂😂 and took only 15 sec to find this. 2 min silence for those who are still searching for this 😂

🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 all the men so sexy
It is sad when the men on the video are not your type
women: don’t treat us like objects also women: *treats themselves and men like objects*
No one is even talking about how Cyberpunk this video is. Good job producers!
Reels dekhke aaye ho na 😃😀
What  “boo” meaning can you tell me please?🤔
Ending seems like Desmond in assassins creed 3😂
Really like the way how she used Augmented reality and AI in her video. She has the bright future.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
This song makes me miss the streets
I like the song , but I can’t relate lol.
Only Indians How many of you came here after Nora’s clip !!

I love you, sister.
0:36 guys thank me later
She is an artist.  She’s letting us watch her evolution, as an artist and as a person... all the people who make the same predictable comment about her looking different in every video need to understand this.
Cắn nail hồi rớt mẹ cái nail giả. Ờ tóm lại là thích nhạc Cardi B hơn

This is a Sagittarius And Aquarius song

Armys reading ffs be like :

it’s cause she black fishes
Kpop stans let's rise for our anthem
الامفي يفشل
🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰
Perfeita 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
This is the first video I’ve seen without hate comments
I wish Princess didn't get a breast augmentation. I loved her natural chest. "My little titties and flat belly." As long as she is happy that is all that matters.   As for this track, pure 🔥 like usual.
🥵🔥
I love it 😍😍
Princess nokia in my mind : my lil tities my fat belly.
ok
Wonder if she likes guys with tattoos
You go girl
Love this song. You 're so sexy
This set was dangerous!
fuckin hot concept, love it
There were so many diverse types of zaddies in this video it was insane 😩 Go off Destiny
Trop lourd le son
Now to make it pansexual: I like him Like her too He my man She my boo They my type  They so cute I want him And I want them too
ive been hearing this song everywhere but im kinda surprised seeing it only has 9M views
The man is very luckyyy
Solo caballería pesada 👌🤤
👏🎤💃🎶😏
Ohhh this is damn🔥
I like you baby girl... hello from Slovenia ❤💋
So 1 minute wasted on the intro👍🏻 way to go
Who is the super fine guy at the 1:12 mark?????  Those eyes omg
This song turns gay guy's on too
Stolen rhyme
I DONT LIKE ANYONE
IS CUTE
The ending sounded like she was being fucked/having sex
NY vibes. Yup. Love it.
Jesus Christ is coming
Brasil??
My nome is pincess Samsung
Eye candy all through out yes girl 😍😍😍😍
who is here after seeing it on insta reels !!
Who came here after watching nora fatehi's meme 😂😂😂😂😂
celine 21s
I legit thought it was Fergies voice 😳
❤❤❤❤
I think she needs a Jhonny sins ASAP
Great Track 💯💯💯
Is this the same chick that screamed "My little titties and my fat belly"???
THIS SOUND IS FAMILIAR. IS THIS SOUND FAMILY? 👁️👄👁️🔪
I always look at dude's shoes first.
...wtf....this is wack. You're failing yourself miserably and you don't even see it, Destiny.
Man how hip--- hip change from when I was growing up.
Till this moment i don't know where is the cute boy in the video 🙂🙂🙂🙂 i can't see him🙂🙂
Me:    🤡💅
New Generation song I like!
Anime watchers be like:
0:54 starts song
SLINGSHOT - Lil Xan
The entire thing is bad but the first set with the first guy is the best. I'm cruisin the streets of the Rio Grande Valley with this shit bitch. I officially LIKES U Jaja
Give her ha flowers already
That's me when it comes to BTS I like him Like him too He my man He my boo He my type He's so cute I want him  And i want him too Idk the 8th person.....maybe bang pd, lmao
Wait she’s so pretty 🥺
Love to see all types of men.
Okay Nokia. I waiting for your crash test.
1:20 My mom said "Oh, JLo Está muy joven" jajajaja
I didn't know this song until Tik Tok introduced me to it
14/01/2021 I love u dear
Lets be honest..                          You searched this video up                                     *didn't you Billy*
cyberpunk2077
Props to princess Nokia. Her body is real! #real
2:18 the casher boy who is he ??
She tried to steal Mabels style
Me : *is a weeb* My friend : so, how many Anime guys do you like? Me : *I like him, like him too, he my man, he my boo, he my type, he so cute, i want him and i want him too* My friend : *why is she even my friend*
Can someone please tell me what do the lyrics mean or like what is she trying to say?
1:09   HOLY     MOLY
"I'm not a wife so talk to me nice" just does it for me idk why
Damn where the Nokia from tomboy at???  Yes I know she’s the same but I like that 1. Just tired of seeing the same shit over and over you know?..
She like em all
she changed!!! well if she is happy what can we say
I see Nikki but hear Cardi
The remarkable change oddly snatch because english cumulatively lie concerning a legal cupboard. sick, inexpensive salt
The oceanic daffodil clinically multiply because transport endoscopically phone forenenst a silent particle. thundering, likeable edge
The purple tachometer intradurally disapprove because kilogram realistically point absent a thoughtful lemonade. muddled, muddled exchange
The vivacious pedestrian findingsinitially allow because structure normally visit toward a thundering disadvantage. symptomatic, heady parrot
The voracious soybean orly point because litter probably strap given a damaging goat. wasteful, massive coke
After seeing this video  My mind : I think I should not settle down with a single man .😑😑  Me : (to my brain) you are really dangerous.😲  My brain : I am 😁😁😈😈
Instagram li0n.deadstar
When your Venus is in Gemini
Ofcourse a Gemini would sing this song
Me gusta la canción pero no el video
This what Cyberpunk was meant to look like
Woow.... Now I found out who sings this
She copied Ariana, you son of a bitch!
Is something wrong with her boobs?
Was she even touching the screen
Lotta daddies on here
That's the power of a gemini honey 😘💪
This just showed up in my recommendation
Must be Cardi B's Cousin🤣😅
This is the mf anthem 👏👏

Ngl every time I see the thumbnail I think it's Tisha Campbell
I respect the diversity in this video! I love the lyrics and I love that she included all men. Don’t matter the color you got a penis you was in this video lol. Loved it!

She luks like a goddess when she came out from the curtains
She's really come a long way from her little titties and her fat bully
Princess Nokia confirming all she isnt
Idk how she looks completely different every time I see her
it should be sponsored by nokia ...

My pansexuality is just vibing with this song
i hope i'm wrong but: fake boobs ✓, fake lips ✓, too much ugly ass make-up ✓, generic music video outfits ✓, generic trap beat ✓... yup, ladies and gentlemen, we have a sellout.  r.i.p. the old princess nokia we all loved
What is this? Princess Nokia? Bitches be naming themselves after Cell Phones now?
❤️❤️❤️

Goddess
Let’s  agree on her taste is shit. No offense.❤️
This is the friendly and youth free version of WAP😅
She’s so pretty 🤩
Very weel to listen this song...
Not me being lesbian and singing this
Weirdo
Hepsi tipsiz aq i prefer edits boys.
Who knows the name of the Pansexual version????
Her legs told me to go to the gym

Saw on my recommendation and clicked cause of word “NOKIA”
For some reason this sounds like wap 😳
Yo lo unico que rezo es que no vuelva la moda de los pantalones a la cadera skinni y mostrar la tanga
NOKIA ALL THE WAY
I'm in love with this song🔥🔥🔥🔥
The internet after watching this : wap.exe has not been found
So this is basically a song depicting the fantasies us girls create before falling asleep?
QUEEN 👸
Am I the only one who noticed what she and that last Asian dude were doing right before the video ended? 👀
Gemini's are such queens
Me the minute I Land in uk and start seeing British guys :) ❤🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Miracle that Mariana Pequeña didn't copy this beat or lyrics lol
Alguien que hable español ??(. ❛ ᴗ ❛.)

Does anyone remember how she looked in her music video tomboy?! She doesn't even lookj like the same person!
I'm guessing she thinks ariana would steal this song from her "sOuNdS FaMIliaR" foh
I need the boy with the Bandana who has his IG😫
I thought at first this song would sound like a princess. But it sounds more like queen
The telephone part is brilliant
Sad

Зачем пенсионеров в клипе снимали?!
Nice😄
And I HATE!!! writing negative comments (I really don’t comment positive or negative very much at all) but this is just to awful!!
So all of a sudden (this new generation of millennials) a pretty face and plastic surgery body now equates to a person having  talent?? Or ur talented enough to get on??   This song is trash!! Her lyrics are trash!! Her voice is mediocre.   I truly don’t understand.  Smh!!    Please make it stop!!
Me when someone asks me who I find most attractive in BTS: *I like him, like him too, he my man, he my boo, he my type, he so cute, I want him and I want him too*
OMFG... PLEASE tell me if anyone knows his name or his IG account.  (2:39). HE FIONE fine!

It’s a shame I’ve been following princess Nokia for a while now and always appreciated her versatility and the contribution too underground genres but now she gone full niki minaj and plastic and fake she blew up. This society doesn’t appreciate art.
https://youtu.be/klGfyIUY2vM  support me i'm a music maker  fl studio mobile

She literally never looks the same and I love it.  We versatile af👐🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

Wait is it the same girl from the Tomboy video?????
Why 1992 is so good but this isn't
I sing this song like i'm the main hoe, but in reality i'm a virgyn
This is me on tinder 🤣🤣🤣🤣
the intro looks straight out from cyberpunk2077!!!

old school beat
Sounds like a great way to live life.
why is she named after a phone
Giving me Black Mirror vibes lol
𝙺𝚊𝚕𝚒𝚝𝚎 𝚊𝚔ｪ𝚢𝚘𝚛.
GIVE ME PIN,PLEASE... I AM AN INDONESIA 🇮🇩
!!!!! In the very beginning What/who mixes that edm type vibe track before the actual song starts
After 1:05 I was 🙂
HOW IS SHE NOT BIGGER?
Pushing transhumanism into normalcy makes me🤮
I'm offended by this objectification of the male species!
Nice.... but to slow for me! Can't dance to this. Good luck!
Story of my life.. I like all of them so what!? Lol
Did she just get hers at the end in a fucking bodega?
0:33 cyberpunk 2077
Got in to 1minute and 25 seconds: trashiest garbage I've ever seen. Why aren't women seen as equals, but play things and only sex objects? This crap that brings us down. I'm sure this lady got her $$$.Clearly, no one ever taught her not to be a puppet--Tom Petty had a great song about women in the music industry like her.
My man wicked and ink man strength cartel
mbak nya maruk
Imagine seeing your dad in this and saying “oh so that’s where he went to get milk”💀
This song is my relationship status these days lmfao frrrr
Ofc a song bout girls bein hoes b sayin they ain’t 💀 find sum better to rap bout then yo pussies 😭😂
Wait a minute so in the start of the video, she was sleeping in those clothes?
Only things comes to my mind is haikyuu!! and free! Boys while listening to this song
She sounds like Cardi b.
O música boa do caralho
Another stupid song, no talent required in the music industry anymore
it's going to be like that soon
Princess Motorola.
Faz música com Anitta girl!
This how u feel Mami.. that flow tough
I thought this was cardi for s sec
I heard the other version first, and honestly, this just isn’t as good.  Saying “him” a bunch gets real repetitive.  🤷🏼‍♂️  Gayer is better ig.
does anyone know the instagram of the 1st male model of the video?
Seems like WAP music, but less nudity🙄
Just feel in love with the song but video was fire love the men yesssssss
Can we talk about how they all cute
Quien vino aquí por los videos de tik tok ?
I like him Like him too He my man He my boo He my type He's so cute I want him And want him too I like him Like him too He my man He my boo He my type He's so cute I want him And want him too Hop in the whip Hop in the truck I do whatever the fuck that I want I'm not a hoe I'm not a slut I like to fuck and I sure like to suck I am that bold Freezy like ice I'm not a wife so talk to me nice You ain't my type I don't like you You a broke boy, look at your shoes I'm the player And I am the pimp All of them boys, make 'em the trick All of them boys, they on my shit But all them boys, they make me sick I do not see you taming me 'Less them there entertaining me They just tryna p-play with me Play with me, you gon' pay the fee I like him Like him too He my man He my boo He my type He's…

DOLLA- IMPIKAN ( LYRICS ) https://youtu.be/29uK4pKg9NU
These looks are recreations of iconic looks from the past right? They all look familiar like they were from my childhood.
I have to be honest. This song is cheap and video is boring.  hundreds of songs like this. you used to be different. now you're like everyone. and i don't appreciate your fake boobs. If it's only for you then don't show them on videos. I love you but i don't think you're going a right direction now
The men looking real good in this video
Love nokia...and she a gemini i think lol ..thats juice i need to drink...
Ogni like un nuovo nokia 👇
dafuq happend to you
Not good enough next time call lil yatchty the goat under all the boats
All I could think during that whole video was "wow what a fucking assortment of dudes, all cute but normal looking!" Like dude in the track suit was balding, buff dude by the car was older, that one gang guy had titties, the asian guy was a toothpick. All cute, but not in that overt music video way. Way to normalize normal bodies!
Wow!!
Can we talk about her nails ??¿¿
be trusting that top more then my best friends
Hop out the whip hop out the truck. I do whatever the fuck that i want. Im not a hoe im not a slut BUT I like to FUCK and I sure like to SuUCK

WAIT- Why did I not realize Princess Nokia made this song??
Meh. I like your other songs. This shit kinda weak except for the whole "let's sexual men this time, lol" thing. Not bad, but I know you got more to bring to the table.
2005 is back huh
those old school vibes are a mood like she ate in those low rise jeans with thong
2 reasons why 1:11 don't like to suck, a lollipop 1. I choke on water 2. I can somehow choke on air
Finally I found it!
Me watching knowing its probably only editing:   But girl, what gloss are you wearing because I'm in envy?
محمد ڨداااال وين راك
This really my shit
I wish this song was longer!!!
0:53 she walks out like a demon disguised as a pretty woman to lure humans in and feed off of their soul
Wow, haven't heard from her in forever, she just disappeared from social media
I love her body.
Honestly, This shit is fucking weak.
Haha love this

Me in 3rd grade when me and my two friends had a crush on the same guy: 0:50
She already looked different almost every video, now she’s had so much work done she really doesn’t look like herself.
Its NOKIA  You can't break her heart  Cause its Nokia

Oh my!!! This is so underrated song!!!!!!!
please call CARDI  BE for this BEAT
I think there's a story behind this.. A women can also be naughty and not could a slut. coz men do that and no one says anything !!!
Had to watch twice, i like you
No one notices how this is continuously referencing the beast system in Revelation of the Bible!? I.e. the merging of A.I., virtual reality, internet of things, and man. People seriously need to wake up! Jesus is the way, and the only way to be saved! The pop culture has you distracted on sexuality while selling you satan's vision for your future, which is a life or death as well as an eternal life or death situation! Because once people take the mark of the beast to "merge", they are damned with no hope of salvation, or free will for that matter. You should check out China's social crediting system to get a picture of the tip of the ice berg of what this is going to look like. Why do people celebrate people who are selling them the devil's plan??? Is anyone watching this trash using their brain? Or are we just gonna keep obsessing over peoples looks, as if that really counts over character and content.
im over here thinkIng girl don't slice ur neck with them nails

i like the diversity in this
This song makes me want to break up with my boyfriend
This video is like mabel's boyfriend
Ummm why does this sound like H1gher music's Telefono mixed with pH1's Malibu. This gotta be plagiarism. Almost the exact flow from the song too. 🤔
love the first look sheesh , bhadie but still classy

Why doesn’t this get the same attention as wap.
theres a part that remembered me of bartier cardi by cardi b (on the video)
I liked her and her music before she went mainstream. Now she looks like any other female rapper. What happened to "my little titties and my fat belly" ?
The fact that she’s white 🤪
who is the guy standing by the car?!!
romeo santos
a boooooooop
Eeeeeeek the you and the guys 😍😍😍😈
These songs really got me real hard
Nokia Phones in 2020 😂
Зацепила. Смотрю второй раз уже))) красотка и красавчики👌👌
I hate ppl who say when a guy sing this song he is gay
she is the only woman in the indusrty with  a natural ass
I like all of them
he my man, he my boo, and i say, cardy who?
This explains my relationships completely
Wow this is ........ creative 😅
I like how her flow matches the beat and I love the visuals
I just realised the message of this song and finally get it and think it’s great
why does she look unreal damn thats hot
So sad to see that she had to hide her stunning beauty underneath so much make up, operations, to look like everyone else in the industry. So sad she began making soft porn to promote her good music(in the videos), she could have managed without since she has so much talent!! She was such an icon.   The music i still good though and I recognize it's not easy keeping it real as a woman in the music industry! I hope you are alright Princess Nokia. Seems like they got to your self esteem. 💔 Your voice and music still kicks, tho! Keep on doing your thing. Never thought you'd change in this way but I still support you as a woman and artist although so many women would be empowered if you keep yourself confident enough to show true beauty and only selling music, with porn MV:s.  Imagine if all the great female artists got together and started their own label without porn... Mary J blige, Bey, Rihanna, Nokia, Ashanti, and so many more. THEY WOULD ROCK THE ENTIRE WORLD without hesitation! It doesn't have to be this way.
You WERE cool... Te me caíste...
This reminds me of those early 2000s videos on BET and MTV yasssss 🔥
How about princess Samsung
#bitchpower
She and Azealia Banks deserve all the fame and recognition of this whole world
damn she powerful woman

Time is short very short...  Our Lord Jesus Christ is coming back really soon... Accept him, with him comes eternal life. Securing that is extremely important... ..  For those who want to know Jesus Christ, my precious saviour say this salvation prayer out loud " Dear God I come to you a sinner I repent from the bottom of my heart please forgive me. Jesus, I believe that GOD raised you from death I make you Lord in my life baptize me with the fire of the Holy Spirit burn the chains that hold me captive to obeying you. I believe Jesus Christ you are the son of the living God please write my name in the book of life from today Jesus I make you LORD and saviour in my life. Guide, protect and teach me your word AMEN"  That's all next read the book of John & Hebrew u will know how precious Jesus Christ is he is amazing and waiting on you.
Love this.
Just simps 🤦🏽‍♂️

Am really grateful and thankful for what dr sebi has done for me and my family with is herbal herbs , I have be suffering from HIV for good three years with no solution, the diseases almost took my life and because I was unable to work and I was also loosing lots of money for medication, but one faithful day when I went online, I met lots of testimonies about this great man so I decided to give it a try and to God be the glory he did it. If you need his help or you also want to get cured just the way I got mine, just email him below (dr.sebi324@gmail.com) you can also whatsapp him at +(2349044159370) and get your healing. He has cure for other deadly diseases like Herpes, Hiv/Aids, STD , Hepatitis , Cancer , COVID 19 VIRUS, Fix Broken marriage , Looking for a child he can still do that for you .

So unfortunate. I remember when Nokia used sing empowering women's songs.  Looks like she sold out.
hi nokia
How is this the same woman from "TOMBOY?" I know I'm getting old and am out of the game, but what gives?
There needs to be a girl version.
Ay  mami querico
Brilliant excellent girl power💯💚👑
Princess Samsung
This video is less cooler than everything else she's ever done. And her style doesn't seem unique here. She just looks fake sexy
She’s so pretty
Tiktok popular song🔥🔥🔥🔥
Likeee ugh🔥
Who came before tik tok
These guys, they’re all so beautiful🥺fire video
Walking around dont a give fuvk abt u think
yas skin texture :)
داعرة
That damn pc was made b4 she was even born
Nokia 3310 leave chat
Fuc the long ass ads
Why am still so obsessed with this song!!
The fact she is objetifying (in a good way) males instead of female models as every other artist and ALSO included an asian man *UGH I LOVE HER MIND* 😍🙌🏽👏🏼
She is goregous!😍
*OMG THIS WAS SO GOOD*   ... Read more
Not a tomboy anymore🙄
1:41 I had a man with saggy nipples like that once. Not to be trusted
I can’t stop thinking of Tomboy when I watch this 😂 wow gurl
This song is really good, and the gold outfit was honey drizzled over butterscotch and caramel. She made the look work like it had student loan to pay back.
Nokia phone vs Nokia princess which’s sexy comments below.😉
See y'all after 7 8 years when this will pop up of nowhere or you'll search for it
That’s a lot of men I’m kinda uncomfortable
Learn it from TikTok 😅
YESSS! A video I can relate to 😂 Wanting to be surrounded by fine ass men
If you're a Kpop Stan then this is the most relatable song for you.
You ,yes you reading this comment going to achieve whatever you have dreamt about. Keep working hard ✅
She stole Ariana grande pony tail .. she had one that look like that smh... (it’s a joke iykyk)
Ariana ended princess flop with ease
she's my type, she so cute
Tik Tok
NaX needs to re open.
💕
Simppp
I like how mister is combing her hair...yes
She looks like she's gonna have sex all the time. But she doesn't.
Se parece Denfraa #PANAMÁ🇵🇦 JAJAJJAJAJAJAJ🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The people that say that she “isn’t so natural because she got a boob job” doesn’t mean that she doesn’t LOOK natural. Her boobs are not too much, they look good. I swore they were natural, until I read the comments.  I guess I just don’t understand why people are trying so hard to prove that she is just like other  rappers, bc she got a boob job Like frl
Finally this song got an MV!!
I do whatever the fuck I waaaant
*0:50** Me and my bestfriend stalking mens be like*
Okay the first dude that they show a close up at the beginning is so good looking. Does anyone know who he is? The hispanic one with the gold chain, black hair, tattoos up to the neck.
she really nokia princess
Most anime fans:  i LiKe hIM LIkE tOO He mY MaN He mY Boo hE my typE hE sO cUTe i WaNT HiM aND i WaNT HiM tOo

I wonder if this is what players do
Nokiaaaa😍😍😍
I love youyuuu nokiaaa
I found some of the vid a lil cringy but the song is fab
90s music video trend officially back?
Serviu tecnologia, voz e coreografia. ESSA MULHER MERECE O MUNDO.

Where are the two hands in the intro that do the handshake ?
The diversity in this video is crazy ! both her style and the men! get it sis
as a bisexual this experience was very harrowing for me.. _lemme do it again, i loved it_
She has great voice and Great song tooo but she doesn’t know how to dance 🙃 and that’s okay.... She is a Talented Lady ✌🏻
Omg that dude is Apollo from RHOA aka Phaedra’s baby daddy holy shit
daddy gonna be like: "nah-ah, I do not like any one of them"
I love the fact that she can be confident of her body even tho its not the "ideal type", cause i surei wish i could
im so gay
they're all so hot tho
my ears are bleeding. Make it stop.
Asian bul bagged at the end
haha, this is feminism 2020
The first man... My god what a beauty
Train. Train?
Somehow reminds me of Doja Cat
erica mena vibes
Damn did she get facial reconstructive surgery?
Men in a music video 💯🇲🇽
these outfits thooooooo
No one noticed how she added the @s of everyone who worked for the mv in the description box. she took giving appreciation & credit to another level.
The fact that I'm 16 and all these men look incredibly sexy and attractive! The diversity is immaculate! 💜✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿
şarki cok GÜZEL
she's flaunting they curves and she know she look good,always awesome to see a girl that isn't unnaturally skinny
Boyfriend by mabel vibe s.. videoclip

Queen of millions views per week
“I’m not a hoe, I’m not a slut. I like to f*ck and I sure like to suck”  Uhh...
this song is a fucking piece of shit
So many comments about how she is FINALLY a woman surrounded by men instead of the other way around like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKNcuTWzTVw  didn't exist 8 years ago.
Las que vienen de un edit de kpop : ? Alguien?

Many Blessings Beauty Queen U is slayyinn 💯❤💋🙏🏽 this song 🔥
I heard this song in  meep city XD
She changed, looks ordinary like all female rappers actually. Lacefront, nails long, beauty make up... women in industry got be "sexy" to be accepted.
Nedenini bilmiyorum ama ünye sanayide popüler oldu bu şarkı :D
Was so happy to remix this track!
She and saweetie would be a good collab😌
the start reminds me of Doja Cat
This is how you do WAP without sounding like you're actively trying to be gross XD
👀 Papi in the cap..
ز
I love her top Outfit ❤️
45 saniye başlamasını bekledim bkxhcdhb

Why does this look like Mabel’s song Boyfriend, a little
Nora after seeing this "now I am gonna lyricist "
La portada es muy tirando a la de Mabel en boyfriend, creando hombres ideales 💎
I come because of the singer name.
1:21 as Korean I hear that she is keep saying 오늘은 [oneuleun] which means today is in Korean
I like how all the men are being really nice to her
2020 baby 💛
I like him but I like him too😂😂😂,yeah me too.😄😄😄

You go Guuurl 😍🤘🏻
The diversity in this video is immaculate
What a banger 💜💜💜
In real world these men would tear up the plastic
Shit slapps hard
1:06 it's the cultural appropriation for me (but oh well if it's not black culture then nobody gives a fuck)
She looks like Rosa Acosta
I thought that's a nokia ringtone at 00:03
who is here from tik tik???
You a broke boy, look at your shoes 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
I suggest you go and watch her interviews after this....🤣🤣🤣 Multiple personalities defined
Fine Nice
Девочка с картинки?
She looks so good with her natural body, I had this song on my phone but I lost that phone, now I saw the music video I was like nahh, just the same thing with gals twerking around. But I clicked and was shocked, gosh I like I natural curves, I was thinking the music industry don't be liking stuffs like it. This is an encouragement, u don't have to have 5 inch waist and 1000 inch hips and butt to look beautiful. I love her already. I love her style, I love ever about her, she is my best female artiste. I like her allot. And the fact that guys are not treating her like trash like most video nowadays, she is trying to you that you're a queen and you should remain that, never drop your crown for any guy who won't help you carry it. And that's on period.

She looks like Stefflon Don at the beginning and I thought the first guy was Travis Kelce.
Which girl's looking at this thinking like "Damn, I shoulda spent some some more time on my abs in this Quarantine?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPz-hU24Q1I LOL
All these men are so red flags but i couldnt agree that they are the best lmaooo.
The last part is soooooo meeeeee😍yuuuuus
The woman of a thousand looks! 🙌

Я одна русская ? I from Russia

Why the dial tones?
Just re-watched and noticed the lucky kitty smirking at the end, lol 😘
Sorry but I haven’t forgotten her sexualizing being “small” and child like 🤢🤢
wow
UUFFF!!!🔥
SHE LOOKS SO GORGEOUS R U KIDDING ME
this is the new no type anthem.
Like the zillakami tag
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”  Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”
I notice that princess Nokia got kind of thick in all the right places. I love how she changes her look never the same.
Omg I never had a crush in so many people in one video ,_,
all those dislikes are from jealous exes she left behind
I need her to poke my eyes with dat nails :')
I don't think there's a single unattractive guy in this vid despite them all being so different. I love this.
asian pornic

The Kingdom of God is near .. repent while there is time and accept the Lord Jesus Christ as the only savior .. Evil wants to prevent you from seeing the truth and wants to take many to hell .. Believe it will take ...

2000s vibeee
Estan todos buenos en el video... ¡Caliente!
Lmao the video not the best for the music 🤷 I expected more. But she was objectifying men 🙏 I don't see male humans complaining. You females take things too personal
'I like to fuck and I sure like to suck'  🤮 ..vulgar and vile
หัวนม
She got that thicc
✨She is SERVIIINGG✨
Let’s talk about the boiiiz in this video
she's the one
When u at the airport,this is gonna happen ;-;
Ari 🖤🖤🖤
Conspiracy theory...the artist once known as Destiny is actually AOC and the artist known as princess Nokia is a clone.
🛣
I love the early 2000s vibe.
Must have been weird to just be swiping in the air when filming this😂
Sad to see her sell out. She is not Cardi B or Nicki Minaj. I liked her when she was not mainstream. She is trying way too hard.
PrincessNokia! You the baddestt Boo. 🖤☯️
I like him too 👀
Wow .... she has one from every country state and city ! The diversity.... choices .....
And that's why I want to live in the United States. Thank you.
Am i the only one who thought this was the nokia ringtone at first
Girl power❤
Guys she is the lady in the video
This Amazing Woman scares me...like she’s “power of makeup “ was a person✨💕
I appreciate all of the eye candy on here. We don’t have enough visuals of men like this. 🤪
She looks like shirin david sooo bad
why the double standard or how it's good she has boys surrounding her but it's bad when girl's are surrounding men?
WAAA
Making daddy real proud like I'm Kyla Pratt, giiiiiiiiiiiiiirl 💅🏾
The fact that she's a Gemini has me very proud
1:02  she kinda looks like Ashanti here. This video definitely gave mid to late 2000's vibes.
All this time listening to this song on tiktok thinking cardi b who sings it, I'm so dumb 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Her and steffflon don favor to me
Your gonna get famous like cardio b🔐
DAYUM... I LIKE HIM TOO 1:42...   love this track!!!
we're finally portraying realistic bodies to be just as sexy as all those thin or intense hourglass figures. all bodies are beautiful, and while society still has a long way to go it makes me feel so happy and empowered to see how far we've come.  edit: thanks for all the likes! I recently took out the phrase "stick thin" because many people found it offensive. I'm sorry for being rude, that was not my intention whatsoever. thank you all for letting me know of this, let me know if I should change anything else and have a good day <3
I need to know what that nice looking man's name is in the beginning. Mf'ing dime piece right there
princess ... Nokia?
she reminds me of Aaliyah 💓
Princess Nokia you sexy asf 😍
What happened to her? I think her old stuff is more real and thought out. This looks like she is being molded into some sort of new look, like everyone else now.

iconic
My name is Kyle Neethling better known professionally as WOKEUPBLESSED  Many people don’t know why I go by the stage name 🚨WOKEUPBLESSED🚨 and there’s two main reasons why.    In the year 2018 my parents decided to get divorced due To financial reasons and merely because the energy was just futile. It wasn’t always like this and that’s why I think it impacted me the most.    Me and my brother (who was 12 at the time) had to experience this together. On my 21st birthday the divorced was finalized and there was no money for any pompous celebrations or you know, the usual shenanigans which tbh didn’t bother me I just felt like it was bad timing.    As a creative being around negative energy is a big NO for me, I fell into a state of depression and this went on for months    Since there was no money my Mom, Brother and I had nowhere to go we stayed in my aunties living room for about 1 year before moving out which was about 2018 to about mid 2019.    The worst part is, none of my friends actually knew what I was going through. I had no one to talk to I had to face my demons alone. Being White I was always looked at as the one with money but everything I have I’ve worked for or towards. I was literally at the point where I wanted to give up it felt like my parents life had now become mine.    Me and my mom were the only two working at the time we have been through tough obstacles and are still going through tough ones to this day I don’t have the greatest life yet but I’m grateful for everything and everyone who radiates positive energy in it ❤️    I always told myself that no matter what I’m going through there’s probably someone out there going through MUCH WORSE than what I am which is no reason for me to take my life nor be depressed about it. This is one of the main reasons for the name WOKEUPBLESSED because no matter what I’m going through I still managed to live another day and I can use that 24H to change my current circumstance 🙏    Due to #COVID19 my Mother got retrenched from her job and I NEED your help to inspire more people ❤️  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEeDuzaSRPk

I tried to be strong just for the kids but I could not control the pains that tormented my heart, my heart was filled with sorrows and pains because I was really in love with my husband. Every day and night I think of him and always wish he could come back to me, I was really worried and I needed help, so I searched for help online and I came across a website that suggested that Dr vera segi can help get an ex back fast. So, I felt I should give him a try. I contacted him and she told me what to do and I did it then he did a Love spell for me. 11hours later, my husband really called me and told me that he missed me and the kids so much, So Amazing!! So that was how he came back that same day, with lots of love and joy, and he apologized for his mistake,and for the pain he caused me and the kids. Then from that day,our Marriage was now stronger than how it was before, Thank you  Dr vera segi for bringing back my husband and i recommend Dr vera segi for anyone who is having troubles in their marriage/ relationship.

Me on tinder
God has given us the gift of tongues—a powerful weapon to overcome the enemy  We are living in increasingly dangerous times. For this reason, we need to know the blessings and promises of Psalm 91 because in Christ we can be protected. Another way that we can keep ourselves safe is through prayer. We should not just focus on what is happening around us but instead, pray for ourselves and for our families. We do not know what the future holds, but God does. God knows everything from the beginning to the end and He has given us a powerful prayer language called tongues. “When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.” — Acts 2:1–4 NKJV “When the Day of Pentecost had fully come” — This is referring to the day of Pentecost under the new covenant (on Mount Zion) when God gave the Holy Spirit and the gift of tongues to the church. Also, on this day, Peter preached and 3,000 people were saved. In contrast, on the first Pentecost that took place on Mount Sinai, God gave the Ten Commandments and 3,000 people died. The law kills, but the Spirit gives life. There is nothing wrong with the law. The law is from God and is holy and righteous but the law cannot make anyone righteous. The law cannot bless anyone, sanctify anyone, or make anyone holy. There are people who believe that they can become holy by trying to keep the law. But the law was designed to show our imperfections and our need for Jesus (see Rom. 5:20). Some of us commit sins outwardly while some do so inwardly, so we cannot compare our sins among ourselves. We can only compare to God’s holy standard, and when we do, we realize we all fall short. Yet God loves us all. And because He loves us, He gave us Jesus. Jesus paid for the forgiveness for our sins and make us the righteousness of God in Christ (see 2 Cor. 5:21). It was a heavy price for the Father to offer His Son, but He did it because He loved us.  Tongues is God’s wonderful grace gift to every believer  We see the extent of how much God loves us from this verse: “Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief. When You make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, And the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in His hand.” — Isaiah 53:10 NKJV “Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise Him” — We know that God loves His Son very much (see Matt. 3:17 and Matt. 17:5), yet it “pleased” Him to crush His Son. Why did it please God to crush His beloved Son? Some time back, Pastor Prince caught a glimpse of the meaning of this verse when he had to carry his then 3-year-old daughter Jessica plus heavy shopping bags from a mall to his car. Jessica had fallen asleep in his arm and they still had quite a distance before they reached the car. He shared how his arm started to ache and grow numb, but how he endured the discomfort because he did not want to wake her up. In that way, it pleased him to “crush” his arm for his daughter’s sake. It was his love for Jessica that made him bear the pain. Similarly, God bruised His beloved Son and endured the pain of crushing His Son because of His love for us. We cannot learn this from religion. You learn the magnitude of God’s love for you from the gospels. The reason God gave the law is that God knew that man can be so proud that we do not even think we are sinners or we are “that bad” because we compare ourselves to others whom we think have committed worse sins. But all of us are sinners who broke the Ten Commandments. If not in our deeds, then in our hearts and minds. But even though when we have sinned, God loves us. He loves us at our worst and gave us His Son to die for us while we were yet sinners. Under the new covenant when God gave the Spirit and the gift of tongues, the emphasis is no longer on how bad man is but how good God is. “Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.” — Acts 2:11 NKJV  WHEN YOU SPEAK IN TONGUES, YOU ARE PROCLAIMING THE WONDERFUL WORKS OF GOD.  You are proclaiming how despite your failures and sins, God will run to where you are. You are declaring how God takes great lengths to save you, to love you, to bless you. You are professing all about the loveliness, the beauties, the glories, and the excellencies of our God. Tongues is a grace gift that God has given you to help you in the areas of stress, anxiety, worry, panic attacks, physical trouble, and even chronic illness and disease.  When you pray in tongues, you are praying for your future  Tongues is a weapon from God, an instrument made in heaven, that has many benefits. One of the benefits is that when you pray in tongues, you are praying powerful prayers for your future and your children’s future. You are not only praying for good things, but you are also praying against all the evil plans of the enemy. This can be much more restful than praying in a known tongue (e.g. English). If you pray in English and the Holy Spirit gives you a vision that the enemy’s plan is for your child to experience an accident in the coming week, you will pray immediately for your child’s protection. But you will not just pray, you will also probably stop your child from even leaving the house in the days ahead. Why? Because even though you know you prayed for your child’s protection, you are still afraid and worried. On the other hand, when you pray in tongues, you don’t know what you are praying for and what evil you are praying against. You are simply happily going about your daily activities and praying in tongues, you are covering your child in prayer and praying against the accident unknowingly. And God takes care of it. When you pray in tongues, you are praying for your future and your children’s future without the added stress of knowing what could have happened. Pastor Prince shares that if he had known many years ago that God was going to give him this international ministry, he would have been very afraid. He also shares that the ministry that he has today is a result of him praying in tongues many years back. So when we pray in the Spirit, we are praying beyond the boundaries and the limitations of our knowledge. Pray for the future and especially when fear about the future comes. God is able to reach into the future and touch it because God is timeless and is not restricted by time and space. Praying in tongues builds up your body and sets you free from stress, worry, fear, anxiety, panic attacks and you will experience victory in your life. You can be freed from addictions, and you can even be freed from physical infirmities. So don’t allow people to tell you that the gift of tongues is not from God. There are many schools of thought but we need to go back to the Bible and see what God’s Word says about praying in tongues. “For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.” — 1 Corinthians 14:2–3 KJV “he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God” — When you speak in tongues, you are speaking to God directly, in His language. “And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;” — Mark 16:17 NKJV “they will speak with new tongues” — Jesus Himself said that those who believe (in Him) will speak in tongues.  When you pray in tongues, your body is being repaired and strengthened
When you pray in tongues, your body is being repaired and strengthened  “He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.” — 1 Corinthians 14:4 NKJV The word “edifies” is made of two Latin words, “aedis” and “ficare.” “Aedis” is actually a house or a building. “Ficare” means to build or construct. When you put them together, “edifies” means “to construct or to repair, to build a house.” The Greek word “edifies” is the word “oikodomeo,” and it also has a similar meaning which is “to build a house, to erect a building.” Our body is the temple of God. “Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?” — 1 Corinthians 6:19 NKJV The word “temple” is referring to the Holy of Holies. Your body is the Holy of Holies, the holy place of God and God wants His temple beautiful, clean, and holy. God wants your body healed, made whole, and complete. “He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.” — 1 Corinthians 14:4 NKJV Every time you pray in tongues, you are building every part of your body. This is an important revelation because when you pray in tongues, health is springing forth in your body. So don’t give up on praying in tongues. Keep praying and building your body up with health and wholeness. Whenever you pray in tongues, your spirit prays but it is your body that is being built, constructed, and repaired. God’s way to restore and repair your body is much much better than what the world has to offer. In the law it is written: “With men of other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me,” says the Lord.” — 1 Corinthians 14:21 NKJV Unfortunately, not everyone will see this benefit of health in their lives because they will not “hear” the Lord when it comes to praying in tongues.  When you pray in tongues, God’s rest and refreshing uproots stress in your life  In 1 Corinthians 14:21, the Apostle Paul quotes from Isaiah 28:11–12. “For with stammering lips and another tongue He will speak to this people, To whom He said, “This is the rest with which You may cause the weary to rest,” And, “This is the refreshing”; Yet they would not hear.” — Isaiah 28:11–12 NKJV “stammering lips and another tongue” — This line establishes that this verse is about praying in tongues. “rest” — The word “rest” is “menuwchah” in Hebrew (which is where “manuka” in “manuka honey” comes from). When we pray in tongues we come to a place of rest. We will find a place to rest when we are weary and tired because of all the bad news in the world. The verb for “menuwchah” is “noach” which is the same Hebrew word for “Noah.” “Noah” or “noach” means “rest.” The first time grace was mentioned in the Bible, it was in Genesis 6:8 and it says, “Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.” In other words, “rest” finds grace in the eyes of the Lord. God loves it when you rest. When you rest, you are saying, “God, I am trusting You. God, I am not depending on my self-effort, but I am depending on You.” God loves it. That is why rest finds grace in the eyes of the Lord. “Menuwchah” is also used to refer to the promised land for the believer today. When the children of Israel did not want to believe God when He promised them a land flowing with milk and honey, it broke God’s heart and so He said: “So I swore in My wrath, ‘They shall not enter My rest” (see Ps. 95:11). “rest” — The word “rest” in Psalm 95:11 is also the word “menuwchah.” Rest is our promised land, our portion in Christ. The Bible says, “let us labour therefore to enter into that rest” (see Heb. 4:11 KJV). Sometimes when we pray in tongues and we do not see results, praying in tongues can feel like a “labor.” When you pray and do not see your breakthrough just yet, do not give up. Because before you are delivered from that disease or depression, before you can break free from that addiction, God has to deal with the fears, the anxieties, the stress, and the wrong believing that are causing those things in the first place. As you pray in tongues, the Lord is dealing with all those destructive things from the inside out. In the times we are living in, stress is a real problem. People are stressed because of all that is happening around the world, all that we watch on the news. We need to make sure that we are built up on the inside, that we have strength on the inside so that we do not get depressed on the outside.  THE MORE YOU PRAY IN TONGUES, THE MORE YOU WILL LIVE STRESS AND ANXIETY-FREE.  Pastor Prince shares a study by the Society for Neuroscience which shows that when we are stressed, our bodies release 2 hormones that have adverse effects on our bodies over a long period of time. Some of the effects are memory impairment, lower immunity, hypertension, high blood pressure, hardening of arteries, sleep loss, etc. The conclusion of this study is that stress negatively affects our health in many ways. Today, the devil is trying to wear you out and stress you out. Don’t fight supernatural forces with natural means. There are medications you can take for anxiety and we thank God for that. But when we are dealing with the devil, we need supernatural means. That’s why God has given us a weapon from heaven: praying in the Spirit (tongues). It was only after Jesus rose from the dead that the gift of tongues was given.  WHEN YOU PRAY IN THE SPIRIT, IT IS NOT YOUR LOGICAL MIND PRAYING BUT YOUR SPIRIT PRAYING TOGETHER WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT.
WHEN YOU PRAY IN THE SPIRIT, IT IS NOT YOUR LOGICAL MIND PRAYING BUT YOUR SPIRIT PRAYING TOGETHER WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT.  This is why tongues is a grace gift (not of your own effort). Pastor Prince shares a study done by Dr. Andrew Newberg from the University of Pennsylvania. He conducted a study of people praying in tongues and found that when they prayed in tongues, the usual language centers of their brains were not utilized. The Bible says, “For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays” (see 1 Corinthians 14:14). Pastor Prince shares a testimony of a brother from our church who prayed in tongues and found freedom from severe depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and other severe health conditions that medical science could not cure. Today, he is a leader in the church and his life is completely transformed. Keep praying in tongues and find freedom from stress and worries, and see your body healed and restored.  When you pray in tongues, God heals you from the inside out  When you start to pray in tongues, it may begin like a little trickle of water (you can only say a few syllables) but keep praying and it will become a rivulet, then a river, then a torrential flow, and finally a waterfall. When you first start praying in the Spirit, the Spirit is not battling the problem you have (the panic attack, the depression, the addiction, and your physical disease) because before it battles your problems, it is first battling your fears. It is clearing out the stress, worries, and anxieties from your heart and mind. Before God does something on the outside (physical and tangible healing), He wants to do something on the inside. Pastor Prince illustrates this further through the example of the temple of God during Hezekiah’s reign. “In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them.” — 2 Chronicles 29:3 NASB The very first thing the young king Hezekiah did was to open the door his father (King Ahaz) h ad shut. King Ahaz had shut the door because during his reign, he and the people were doing all kinds of abominable things in the holy of holies in the temple of God. They brought all kinds of defilements, filth, and uncleanness into the temple. And King Ahaz shut the door and locked all the filth inside. Remember we saw earlier that our body is a temple of God. So the temple in Hezekiah’s story is a picture of you and I. We’ve got so much baggage (stress, worry, fear, anxiety, disease, and sickness) on the inside. In the Bible, sickness and disease are also called “uncleanness.” And this is why when Jesus touched the leper, He didn’t say, “Be healed.” Instead, Jesus said, “Be clean.” And we know that the man was healed from leprosy (Matt. 8:1–3). And in the Old Testament, the method to cleanse was to use water. When Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit coming, He calls the Holy Spirit, “rivers of living water” (see John 7:38). He is called “living” because wherever He goes, there will be life. When we pray in tongues, we are allowing the Holy Spirit to freely flow in our lives. King Hezekiah opened the door his father had shut. You can only remove the filth in the temple when you open the door. If our body is the temple of God, which part of our body is the door? The mouth. “Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips.” — Psalm 141:3 NKJV “the door of my lips” — The door in the temple refers to our mouths. To take the first step out of our addictions, fear, worries, and uncleanness (disease), we need to open the door (our mouth). “They have also shut the doors of the porch and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.” — 2 Chronicles 29:7 NASB “shut the doors of the porch and put out the lamps” — The moment you shut the door (close your mouth and stop praying in the Spirit), your lamp goes out. Lamp (light) speaks of revelation, so when your lamp goes out, it means you will not have any revelation. “have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings” — Incense and offerings speak of praise and worship to God. When you shut the door (close your mouth and stop praying in the Spirit), there is no more worship to God. “Therefore the wrath of the LORD was against Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, of horror, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes. For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.” — 2 Chronicles 29:8–9 NASB “the wrath of the LORD was against Judah and Jerusalem” — These verses do not apply to us. Today, God is not angry with His people. And He will never be angry with His people because of Jesus’ sacrifice at the cross. We are not under law. We are under grace in Christ Jesus. “Our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this” — If you have a loved one that is suffering today, it is not because God is angry and punishing you. We have shut the door of our lips, we are not opening our doors and praying for them and making intercession for them. We cannot watch over our children and loved ones all the time. We cannot change our children with our own means and ways. But when you pray for them, God will cause His light to come on them and give them the revelation they need to turnaround.  PRAY AND ALLOW THE LORD TO GIVE YOUR CHILDREN THE WISDOM AND REVELATIONS THEY NEED.  Keep praying in tongues and see the miracle you’ve been waiting for  How long did it take for King Hezekiah and the Levites to see victory? “So the priests went in to the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and every unclean thing which they found in the temple of the LORD they brought out to the court of the house of the LORD. Then the Levites received it to carry out to the Kidron valley. — 2 Chronicles 29:16 NASB “every unclean thing” — This represents our prejudices, bitterness, wrong believing, fears, panic attacks, and evil imaginations. Evil imaginations are very real for people with depression. They cannot see good in their future and always have negative, pessimistic thoughts. Never make fun or make light of someone who tells you they are suffering from depression. Point them to God’s heavenly weapon. So the priests brought out everything unclean and the next verse tells us how long that process took: “Now they began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they entered the porch of the LORD. Then they consecrated the house of the LORD in eight days, and finished on the sixteenth day of the first month.” — 2 Chronicles 29:17 NASB They took 16 days to clean out the temple. Even when you do not see immediate and instant results, persist in praying in the Spirit. You are praying for your future and you will see supernatural results. Some people find it hard to have the faith to speak to their mountains (challenges). God has given us a special way to attack our mountains. “Behold, I will make you into a new threshing sledge with sharp teeth; You shall thresh the mountains and beat them small, And make the hills like chaff. You shall winnow them, the wind shall carry them away, And the whirlwind shall scatter them; You shall rejoice in the LORD, And glory in the Holy One of Israel.” — Isaiah 41:15–16 NKJV “Threshing sledge” — A rectangular wooden plank designed to separate the grain from the chaff. “Teeth” — The Hebrew word for “teeth” is “piyphiyah” and it means “two-edged mouth.” When you pray in tongues, you are using a double-edged sword against your mountain (your problem). This is the new weapon that God gave on the day of Pentecost (2,000 years ago). “You shall thresh the mountains” — You will defeat your mountain (whatever challenges you are facing right now) by praying in the Spirit. “You shall winnow them, the wind shall carry them away” — Another way to separate the grain and the chaff is to throw the grain into the air and allow the strong wind to separate the chaff and wheat. When you are praying in tongues, it might seem like your problem remains even after some time. But every time you pray in tongues, you are cutting away at your mountain and making it smaller, so small that the wind can blow it away.  ATTACK YOUR MOUNTAIN BY PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT EVERY DAY.
ATTACK YOUR MOUNTAIN BY PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT EVERY DAY.  — The porch of the temple is significant. “Now they began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they entered the porch of the LORD. Then they consecrated the house of the LORD in eight days, and finished on the sixteenth day of the first month.” — 2 Chronicles 29:17 NASB The porch here is the same porch that Jesus walked in. During Jesus’ time, the Babylonians had burned down Solomon’s temple and the only part left was the porch. Many of the miracles that Jesus performed happened on Solomon’s porch. “Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter. And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.” — John 10:22–23 NKJV In Mark 11:12–24, we see that Jesus cursed a fig tree, went into the temple and cleansed it (chased out the money changers), then came out and saw that the fig tree had withered. Then Jesus taught His disciples about faith. What happened in the space between cursing the fig tree and seeing it withered is that Jesus cleansed the temple. Jesus cleansing the temple is a picture of praying in tongues. When you don’t see the results you're praying for or declaring in your life, keep on praying in the Spirit. Then you'll come out and see the miracle. Solomon’s porch is mentioned again in the early church: “Now as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Solomon’s, greatly amazed.” — Acts 3:11 NKJV This healing miracle of the lame man took place at the Eastern Gate which is where Solomon’s porch is. Another mention of miracles that take took place in Solomon’s porch is: “And through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon’s Porch.” — Acts 5:12 NKJV After you open the door of the temple (praying in tongues), when you come back out to Solomon’s porch, that is where you will experience your miracles, your breakthroughs. As we continue to pray in the Spirit, we will come to a place where we will be healed and the church will experience signs and wonders. Pastor Prince ends by sharing a study done by Oral Roberts University which found that when you pray in tongues, you boost your immune system by 35–40 percent. God gave us the gift of tongues that not only proclaims the wonderful works of God but causes you to see the wonderful works of God in your life.  Closing Prayer  The Lord bless you and the Lord keep you this coming week, you and your loved ones. The Lord make His face to shine on you and be gracious to you. The Lord lift up His countenance on you and grant to you and yours His wonderful shalom wholeness and peace, in Jesus' name. Amen.  We hope these sermon notes blessed you!

This video made me realise I don’t miss the early 00s
Hey guys, this is a lengthy post, but it's one with a cause.. so please take a few moments to read and to help out! Thanks guys.  I just watched a video that about a case that happened in 1991 that led to the conviction of a now 53 year old man, Rocky Myers. With very insufficient and contradictory evidence, an innocent man in Alabama who was unjustly tried and sentenced to death by a Judicial Override - which means even though his jury had recommended life in prison, the judge decided to sentence this man to death. He has intellectual and learning disabilities, making it hard for him to understand the means of his own case. His jury was made up of 11 white "peers", one of which was even on record using racial slurs in reference to Myers. He has been let down by his lawyers in the past, and was unable to take his case before the Supreme Court because the limitations on time had passed, unbeknownst to his knowledge from lack of communication on his previous lawyer's behalf. There has been new evidence that has come to light in attempts to prove that Myers' case was coerced by the police in numerous ways, but the ONLY way that he can be pardoned from Death Row is by an Act of Clemency from the governor of Alabama.

Black Mirror

Noki for president 2020
The cover of the video seems to be something like Mabel's music - Boyfriend
You are GORGEOUS
She kinda looks like Aaliyah in this video 😻

Miss Destiny with a gir tattoo 😱
Her boobes bigger? Looks amazing tho

An icon, a legend.
wow, she's so hot 🔥
So who’s your fav guy that was in the video ? 😻😻
ICONIC
Yeah but nobody speak on real matter. This Nokia ringtone on first secs of video.
2:30 Blu Cantrell??
One of my favorite song❤❤🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️  U always give what the world need😍
nossa, eu tinha um celular velho que chamava de Princessa Nokia, pq ele era da nokia e rosa com figurinhas da princess.  Que interessante, já sou sua fã
She looks like Stefflon Don. I like her😍
you failed us with that boob job
Imma need a list of all the men in this mv
She really making me reconsider what my type should be
🌻
I am gay for preety ladeey
Who's here after Tik toks about Shawn Mendes and Harry Styles?
Cool video
This is the theme song to my harem of anime mans...
why everyone in the comments want to talk about something lol
I quit my job thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Anyone else start watching not knowing what this was and then at 0:50 u were like OHHhH it’s THAT ✨TIKTOK SONG ✨
one of these views is obama and i cant get over this
Can yall please help reach 2k followers on Instagram My handle is sekhani_wilson
2000 themed video, she doesn’t have a plastic ass body, her sound is unique and  she’s GORGEOUS.. this reminds me of female artists back in the day. OKAY 😍
Is the song about STD? CUZ it looks like it.
Oh wow she looks so different I almost didn’t recognize her. Still love her though💕
This is probably one of da few times I ever seen the female rapper surrounded by guys... usually City Gurls/Megan use other gurls in their hoe anthems
Expected to see a range of men including less traditionally masculine, but atleast it was diverse
0:49 zillakami sample
Reminds me of the locked ups girls who please men in dungeons. sex trafficking.  please be aware of the subliminal msgs they throw out there. they try to make you think its empowerment when it is not. the beat is cute am sure but please read between the lines.
Faaalla Nokia tijolão
It's hard to believe this is the same person that wrote and sang "Look Up Kid"
Cardi needs to be on this 😍
Look like we have the same type
Me just vibing to this
damn princess nokia looks, music and videos all glo’d tf up over the years

This was sexy as fuck.
Literally to the 1% who's reading this, God bless you, stay safe during quarantine and have a beautiful blessed wonderful day♥️.(my dream is to become a famous YouTuber) thanks
Nah. This shit next level fire. Thanks Ms Nokia 🥺
On the part of Princess Nokia, I find it hard to accept all of this. Hypersexualized content, thumbs sucked with a hot gaze; falsehood in shambles. The singer who told us about her small breasts and her big belly is dead, she preferred to drool milk on Instagram to ape the spunk, empty a bottle of water on her breasts while biting her lips, and you buy the history believing to see authenticity. The 9-year-old girls on tik tok see nothing but fire, like all of you who praise sex on all media, who find feminist twerking as if narcissism had become a virtue. The only ones you satisfy are the pedophiles. Bravo to all those sheep of the patriarchy who will soon have talked to me about body positivism and respect for freedoms. I wish you to have children, daughters, who will be subjected to this filthy culture that you adore. We'll see if you talk to them about bellydancing at family meals.
Feels like this song should be in the show Euphoria
i feel in 2002
Love!love!love!
I get Christina Aguilera vibes from this video
This video reminds me of 2000's !

I love how she didn’t choose generic hot guys. They’re all so sexy in a bad boy way 😍 Black, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander 🥵 ooooof all of them look so good and suit her song so well!!!
Whores everywhere. If this is pop music, it means these stereotypes of women are popular. That's why society is fucked up. Literally

Begging gave me "If you had my life" of Jlo lol
This is what i wish the WAP video should have been. Princess Nokia really standing for sexually empowered females 2020!
This is the best song that came out in 2020
I got this from TIK TOK.
I got some reall hard carbi B vibes
Nakita niyo rin ba si Junnieboy?

She got an error, how did she proceed to whatever she was doing?
It’s some FOINE AS MEN in this video😍😍😍
I am Princess Samsung and my best friend (not really) is Princess Apple. Then we have our enemy- Princess Huawei.
Chill asf when you can subtly flaunt the diversity in your taste in men
I can smell this video.
princess nokia is like nokia if it was apple
Talent my fav sonh for 2020
at the end with the lolipop she has a tounge so big that it has the capacity to suck more then  a lolipop
The comment section convinced me to subscribe
you're unbreakable like that old cellphone, slay queen yasss
Nonsensical
She kind of looks like J Lo
😍😍
Я не знаю как я тут оказалась
Yay I really wanted to see this yay
She looks like a different person each time, is crazy
ok so which one is she talking abt... who is "him"
Gurrrrllllllll❤️
I feel the late 90s and the early 2000s vibes
Crazy that this the same artist that made Tomboy. Her look changes like these Instagram filters. Her art reflects this generation. It's a trip. Same voice and Tomboy had a sexiness that's still here. Truely the artist of change and reinvention and the digital age that we live in.  "With my little titties and my fat belly, I could take your man if you fin'a let me. It's a guarantee that he won't forget me."
I honestly only clicked on the video because of her name...
Omg this mv just appeared on my suggestion lol
I just know she s the next Doja Cat
SHOUT OUT POWER PLEASANT!!!! BEST PRODUCER IN THE GAME 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was looking at her body the whole time 😭 thinking how beautiful her natural curves are, ugh ❤️ finally some normal looking hips

Which episode of black mirror is THIS?!!
Bitch ima make u like me boo You be changing up more then my undies  I make my mija avena too
This song is stupid just like WAP
She made this for the women with more than one baby daddy! Lmfao!  That's Me! Lmfao Guilty!  #notsorry
I love this❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the shit right here!! 🔥🔥
this made my day 😭💖👑 I love this song ❤
You da kid from tiktok?
Omg so many 10’s. God damn this might be my favorite music video ever.
Is she black or black facing am so confused this days

I liked them all!
This video is so cringy 😩
I love the diversity of the men in this video 🖤 that cashier at the end was FINE😍
a 'amor de que' deles
O MY GOF I LOVED  THIS SONG😭 this song was how I found out abt her
Who is that at 1:35 😫🥺😍
Tik Tok 👇
Who else thought about Princess Nauwisha song I like him
A MASTERPIECE. PERIOD!!
Charli XCX : Boys Princess Nokia : I Like Him  these two music videos is filled with hot guys 😭🔥
ICONIC
Nooooo what happened to her lil titties 😢
all the guys here are lucky to be near her 👀 (She be looking different every video)
I miss 1992 era... “my little titties and my fat belly” what’s happened???
Omaiga. Me encanta hpta. 🔥
I'm a little worried after this one. Hope she keeps it weird, at least one half of her or something if its possible. Seems to me like shes telling us they've almost got her, but not all the way shes is still lucid.
The last scene omfgggggg get it princess Nokia!
YAASS
The thickness in this video is 💯
“ I’m not a hoe, I’m not a slut , I like to fuck and sure like to suck “ 🔥 🔥 facts I felt that
beginning of looks so much like MABEL's Boyfriend
U my new doja kat
I'm not too fond of the video but this song has actually been one of my obsessions since the album came out.
Hot
Come on natural body! 😍😍😍
She’s so pretty! 😍😍
Boring, it looks like a Missy Elliot rehash mixed with Cardi B but without style. She really is all over the place, I hope Arca collaborates with her and saves her of nonsense.
I’m a week late... but I been waiting on this video 😩😩😩💕👐🏾
So we not going to talk about how her implants look great and natural?
2:34  this part hits different for me 🔥💯
THIS SOUND FAMILIAR TO ME, DO IT SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU? MY GOD!!
This video is so 2000s
money talk bullshit walk
I thought this was Doja Cats song...
Watching this on nokia 6.1 plus
🔥🔥🔥
I haven't watched this Black Mirror episode
this song is abt my husbandos in anime lmao
Yasssss!
I’m shaped like her finally a real looking body 😭🥺you don’t need a giant ant booty to be sexy this is proof 🖕🏼
Adorooooooo♡♡♡♡
Realistic body types are backkkkkkk!!!! Lemme go fish out my bodycon dress.The love handles will be making an appearance tonight 🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽
O começo tá bem parecido com a música de Lucas luco com pabllo vittar
This is how 2050 will look👽🤖
I’m disappointed in how much you changed tbh. I mean do YOU I guess but still it’s crazy... to see the woke soft spoken girl who preached body acceptance turn into a loud mainstream girl who got her boobs done . The difference is night & day 😓

The song is cute🤩 but the ill fitting pants throughout the vid wasnt🤷‍♂️ she's pretty but serves trans woman energy🤔
lyrically bad
Princesse Blackberry
Her voice sounds like Dani Light
Boring everyguy just need a new nokia
No ones gonna talk about how she threw body positivity (loving your natural body) out the window & stopped loving her “little titties” & got a boob job....
IS THIS the same woman from TOMBOY lmao surgery  ??
Killed it🔥🔥🔥
Damn girl. Would.
2:32 Zayn is that u 👀😂😂
this was dope! and better than half the stuff i seen this year
she looks like jenifer Lopez sometimes in the video WTF
My Gemini princess is here to kill itttttt

Tik tok

Sounds too much like Cardi. I don't like to be reminded of anyone else when I'm watching an artist so it's a no for me.
im feeling the early 2000s dress code lmao
A Cardi want to be .... but this a horrible song..she might need to go into modeling
Oh another "empowering" woman showing little girls the blueprint to stability.
Princess iPhone
This the best video ever love nyc rappers
The range the diversity the flavors 😩🥵
She looks different af
I want the behind the scenes anyone else like behind the scene
if cyber sex had a sister
This just proves Nokia were ahead of their time
If y'all coming here from TikTok then you have agreed to respect our Queen Destiny Nicole Frasqueri and her Gemini Oshun Goddess energy. No negative tampering here. You already know the vibessss
I need 1:37 men’s ig for research  👅
Matrix Vibes 💯🚀
She's got major sevdaliza vibes in this vid
Princess Nokia is a shapeshifter 😍
She's the best
What’s this shit
Dude, I know whoever says this gets clowned, but is it her makeup or smth? She LITERALLY looks so different in every one of these more recent M/Vs.
She copying style on Lady XO
Okay I have nothing against her or her music But this video makes no sense to me
She reminds me of cardi b😂😂
This shit is litttttttttt

i love that her body is beautiful but isnt like all famous female celebrities and it looks just like mine, gave me more confidence then anybody has.
the beginning reminds me of "boyfriend" by mabel
This gives me Mariah Carey 'beautiful' mv vibe when she wears that golden dress dancing😍
The ending is lifefuel for Ricecels
Ofcourse it’s only Chads in the video
2:20 I thought the guy in the white hoodie is justin bieber😳😳
So why is no one talking about the dude behind the counter at the bodega! I want him!!

👀👀👀 a literal bopppp
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's 2000s vibes
Not fast and furious
I love this woman...
Princess Nokia is changing every goddam time I see her, I can’t even recognize her most of the time 😭
If you came here from tiktok gather here
I didn’t know this was myyyy girl
No social distancing at all
Pls this song is a fucking bop. I've been listening to it for months now and I still feel badass listening to it
Did she have work done??
From tomboy to cyborg
Is that Nokia ringtone at the first
Chileeeeeeeeee!!! 💁🏾‍♀️❤️
From the streets she emerges to the she shall return 🙏
sis finally made the high budget version of cybiko
Who's the ginger guy at 2:32???? PLEASE reply 😭😭😭😭😭😭
The fact that none of the dudes look the same>>
video concept reminds me of LMFAO
THIS IS PORN.
Thought she was Stefflondon for a sec.
That Nokia ringtone!!! No she did not! 🤣
Can't hear Can't speak Can't see 1:18 Can't complain
Guuuurl, just found you and😍
Thumbnail looking like Nyovest’s Destiny Music Video👀
The music video concept doesn’t even go with the lyrics concept😐
Heyyy this sounds “just like 7 Rings” 🙄💀💀
the flow is reminiscent to cardi b's wap
A whole nother fucking mood!!!
aquele clipe da Ludmilla só que mais produzido e gringo:
Is this the same girl with “little tittes and a fat belly?” Damn she defo a “bruja” !!
ain’t no WAY this is the same woman who did tomboy, QUEEN SHIT!!
THAT HEAT
Princess Nokia got my heart for putting an Asian in her video and for hyping him too 🤧❤️🔥 hope to see more of that
But does he like her 🤭🤔
Her style is so diff
Every boy has tattoo
"I LIKE HIM, LIKE HIM TOO"
The guy with the afro and the dude behind the counter 😍😍😍😍😍 cute AF
so uma coisa : teoria da branca de neve
She literally a different person in every video
How is she so hot???????? Like wow
Y’all listen... white boys, black boys, asian boys. I LOVE IT💕💕💕
😵😵💖🇧🇷
Annoying pagan
She bad🔥
I prefer Prince Motorola
Honestly to me this video feels like scrolling on tinder and sending out hella likes and when you get a match back, you imagine so many scenarios with that guy until you see a notification pop up and you’re like... oh damn I like him to. I never felt the virtual aspect in this song, I always pictured the narrative taking place when you walk into a club and you know you look good so it feels like you could have your pick of the guys in there kinda vibe. But tbh this is so much more relèvent to dating atm with lock downs. For real I’m on hinge just imagining myself into some randoms life out of boredom. Love this video and all her work because it always has a layer there for analysis - like the Balenciaga video you know? Anyways...
*BLACK MIRROR VIBE*
Dose anybody know whats the instagram of the first and second boy???
The men in this video are gorgeous!
You snapped Princess Nokia!!
Oooo baby I appreciate the tech aesthetic ❤️
All the guys in this video were hella fine in my opinion lol
She literally has my belly.
This track is hot! Princess Nokia came to slay. We love a Gemini queen!
i thought this was princess nauwisa - i like him

That was dope!!!
Yo WHO did this video??? It's a masterpiece and the beat's crazy too with the phone keypad sounds in the beat
It's a vibe, my vibe love it lol

I have been waiting for dis to come out for so long❤🧡💛💚💙💜
LOL @ 0.14 when she realizes her ass is not on the chair so she has to slide back a bit lmaoo did anyone else notice?
OKay. but the diversity in this video.
you really deserve to succeed
Is it crazy that I imagine this video? Lol it was a little different but there was multiple men involved just this 😂😂
She needs to do a collar with Queen Apple
Thats me when all my anime hubbys found out about the truth
This video is EVERYTHING!!!
a lot of gemini support here, it makes me so happyyyy
I need to be in that hallway FR FR 😍
GEMINis

No Brasil já é hit💚🇧🇷👍🏻
Who thinks she is the most underrated, but hottest, and sexy rapper
Princess Nokia is the best rapper like if you think so
Who came from Saweetie
This song is absolutely mad underrated, it’s definitely going to blow up!
Who's the first guy?
i love how she can be both tomboy and princess
So wierd how much she changed

A cardi b remix would be even better but this fye

I love her♥️
princess nokia don’t even look like princess nokia
The year is 2030 neuralink
OMG I like it !!!!
*As it should be. Just a lady singing surrounded by men. Beyoncé, J-lo, Ciara and so on have done it too....* ✊🏿
The video doesn’t not go w the song AT ALL
Nokia
Sis gave us 9 fits 😳 and she looks good in all of them
Aye look for shit k
It came in my recommendations tho i have not watched her single video? I am not complaining tho
nobody gonna talk about the tiny, tiny,tiny, 1 second part of denzel curry at the start of the music?
She did THAT
This girl looks different every time I see her 😂
I thought its was Doja Cat song 🙃🙃❤❤
https://youtu.be/b1BL8r1Nf2s
More new music https://youtu.be/cK646oAlWT0
dude this is so black mirror
Omg so gut !!!!
She should release a song named unbreakable 😂😂
The way she almost misses the chair...
https://youtu.be/xRcDG-YY3xQ   Please enter this link.Is a song written by be.
Gente,  princess  nokia  ? Pelomenos podia ser princess iphone aí a gente dava ligancia  , quem hoje em dia tem um celular nokia ?
This is everything and I like to see men and not boys. In male music videos I feel like Im watching girls in high school. But these are grown men that are fiinnneeee. Hot boys delight 🔥
who here before de milion?
I don't vibe with the path she's taking but whatever, it doesn't matter what I think
I get a Black Eye Peas vibe from this video
Damn, Princess Nokia make me want to switch teams!
Can we also talk about how amazing these visuals are!!! Damb!!
This song totally says that..."it's her choice" 🙂🙂🙂
I love her!
She just went crazy..and the eyes candies are on point 🤤
I really liked the first video to this song way more. Still good stuff
Is her body natural? Looks like it is. She’s so pretty!
Teoria da Branca de Neve Por que só ter um se eu posso ter sete

Outstanding effects in this video!! Well done artisticly
Can't lie, came to hate,but I just cant :D
This ain't princess Nokia this a whole new artist stop lying lol
This is pop?
I literally hate when people sit on the edge of the chair like this 0:13 It looked like she was finna fall I swear😂😂
Shirin David is that you?
yesssss
This that tiktok song right?
The thumbnail got me thought this was an asmr before I click it smh
Finally Princess Nokia said to him "I Like Him" undirectly by this music video.
this MV is literally how i dream every friday
whos here after the weird "i like him" message vid trend??
New Princes Nokia sux!!
yes
She became the same as the others plastic dolls. Sorry but I am really disappointed
Y do all women look the same as these days? Typical.
This is exactly how I imagined this official music video to be
she's like a mix of Doja cat I can't wait till she blows up
such a princess chelsea vibe in the beginning
My big titties and my flat belly
This is exactly how i imagined the MV to be like
2:40 guys insta?
nao entendi o conceito e agora
I thought she had little titties and a fat belly
10 years later Princess Nokia will become Princess iPhone
Doja Cat literally has a different hairstyle and color, outfits, make up, even skin shade. But you guys keep obsessing over Princess Nokia smh
Amei
geekdom101
YouTube  BORN GOD,  Character of a Man, CHECK IT OUT
Why error?!

She's look alike cardi b !!!!

that first man in white is an angel... men in white are angels tbh
relatable
Really i can't take this no longer im about to loose it
Her outfit made me feel confident
Sombra is that you?
Man.. I like her..
She's beautiful and very talented! Love this song. However, whoever did her foundation did her dirty :( It's the wrong colour in some shots :(
bruh why she look so diff in every video i love her
Princess Nokia is a  shapeshifter. She looks soooo good in this video. True goddess
I was waiting for the clip😍
ALL those guys are next level hot and she chooses the basic asian guy lol
How do u not have a mill sub's
Now here she sounds like CardiB with less noise pollution.. 😀
she doesn't look like a different person wtf yall blind???? she looked pretty much the same in sugar honey iced tea and that came out like a year ago. aside from that i see the same as in tomboy except fancier
I don't get the concept..
This was everything I needed!!!!!
MAAAAAAAAAAAAAN EVERYTIME

""";?;"""®®✓©®[MIF*;!!'"")))))(:!?'
Better than wap

2:42 I like him.
Wowww. this my first time hearing of her name but i heard this song before 😂😂😂 NEW FAN ALERTTT!!!
Director: How many characters do you want to play in this video?  Princess Nokia: Yes
Eveyone whos saying who she reminds them or mentioning other womens name is part of the problem..why yall always gotta compare or bring up someone else. Just enjoy HER. Damn.
All the guys are sooooo hoot. I preferthe first and second one.
Nokia : Connecting People
As a dude who isn't ripped or incredibly fit like the typical IG model or movie star, I loved seeing how she included men with all different kinds of body types. The diversity among them is even poppin'. They also weren't just the generic looking jocks or personalities you'd see on the screens or in some magazine. I feel like a bad bitch myself after watching. 😁😂😂
алё
I love her outfits  love you
I never saw a rap song where there's more men than women (twerking).       Sorry for my English, I'm French.
i love when women ❤️
That girl is not a tom boy anymore
There's an asian guy too 🤤❤️ love you princess nokia ❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is she the girl who said Ariana Grande stole her beat?
Another one leading women astray.
cool
Yes latina queen
Whytf Nokia??
This woman transforms everytime in every song
She's like stefflon don's sister
I love her body!! It‘s just real.
i literally didn't know this was Princess Nokia rapping... i heard it on tiktok and never KNEW. omg
Um salve pros BR 🤘🏽🇧🇷

THANK YOU FOR SHOWING HOW BEAUTIFUL AND UNIQUE SOME MEN ARE 😩🔥🔥🥵🥵

Omg boys but make it badass I STANNN
Where's my little titties and my fat belly 🤣

Yesssss bishhhhhh here for it all! This my jam! Than came With the visuals 🤤🙌🏾🙏🏾

It's interesting she's singing about liking "him" but she's 200% gay 🤔😂😳
шамалы екен
This video so fire
my era!
I like how she took it to the 2000s it keeps her boyish style while giving space for a girly feel
They all do damn Fioneee🥵😳
wow this whole music video is immaculate
Who is that Asian at that cashier thooo
Her name is like the old cell phone I’m dead 🤣
Why did I find this in Eminem’s song
FINALLY a hip hop female with a realistically proportioned body! This is what curves look like! Not some bumble bee massively inflated ass and a pair of watermelons! We need to see more of this!!! (Also, I'm NOT trying to put anyone down here - however it's a very toxic world we live in when this image of extreme and unattainable curves are shoved down our throats on the daily, I get that a lot of them are proud of what they paid for, but they don't realize the impact it has on everyone else who can't afford that or who simply doesn't want surgery. I think it's unfair these standards and Princess Nokia in my opinion is quite naturally stunning and in my opinion, far more attractive for it.)   I know a lotta people be pissed at me for what I said so let me elaborate. I have no problem with people getting surgery to make themselves happy however. The implications of this are people receiving lethal and botched jobs from surgeons on the cheap to attain these standards and these standards have been around a long time. Clothes are tailored to make women look hourglass but in the recent years, booties have been getting bigger and bigger. This isn't how a lot of people are shaped and if you are, that's great! I see that bodies like this exist and are beautiful, tbh I prefer bodies that look this way however I don't look this way. I only started valuing this particular image when the media started putting so much value on it, we all consume media and have even been told that my own butt isn't big enough and is flat by several people. I'm not hating on people who look that way at all, but I can't ignore that I am valued based on my physical appearance, people are visual. People who get surgery I don't blame them, the industry is competitive but Cardi quoted in an interview "I was a pretty girl before but I wasn't as voluptuous as the other girls, so I paid to get my butt done" (not direct quote but along the lines) so. To compete with the other strippers, be noticed for cash she has to look a certain way and it's been proven to sell and I think this needs to stop. That's why I said Nokia was natural, maybe the wrong choice of words but to correct myself,  I think she looks a lot different to others in this industry. It's a refreshing change but that's not to say any body type is wrong. It's diversity I appreciate. Also when I said Nokia was more attractive for it, I personally am refreshed by her appearance, it's striking in this industry not to have a big butt! It's just the truth and as someone who has aimlessly tried to pursue a career in music, it is very daunting to see the competition and the kind of bodies the competition has and how you might be judged for not looking like that.  I was shunned and outcasted for being different and the world is brutal. One more thing  I also realise my comments might be objectifying but there are people literally having their implants explode because the size they wanna go is so inhuman to their frame naturally. It does look obvious when someone's had some work done, but there's a line that being crossed in recent years, they ain't just bubble butt's any more, they're balloons and it's not real and it's potentially harmful! The real form no matter what it is, should be valued more than it is, as well als diverse shapes and sizes, different waistlines, height, weight,  whatever! I just prefer people like themselves because maybe when that day comes ill be happy enough to like myself however that's my own shit to carry and move on from.
Looks nothing like the Nokia I met but she still beautiful (met her when she was shooting a movie)
And the question is: is she white or black?
I love this sis. I’ll always miss your tomboy days but I can understand tapping into that bad bitch mentality all the way lmao. You been a bad bitch (we all know this) but I see you trying to give these (sheep) *cough cough* what they really “want”
HER WEIGHT GAIN GIVES HER A NEW LOOK. SHES NOW THICKK 🥵🥵🙏🏽
Bad Bitch.👑✨
y’all subscribe to my channel ❤️❤️
i love how unique she is and she doesn't try so hard to look like an Instagram baddie.. she just is! and she represents us medium-sized girls which we love to see
I love this new look!! Beautiful!!
nokia was my first cellphone 😅😅😅 i am here for nokia 3310 (princess of nokia)😊😊
Chillllss Destineyy 😫❤️
wow the end was actually kind of shocking/depressing.. none of it was real. she's actually in this dirty old building, relying on this tinder mechanism trying to feel something. the way they zoomed out was pretty powerful
Ooooooh my God she's gorgeous
11:44
i love this so sexy. Yasssssssssssssssssssss
rolasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I hadn’t seen the singer of this song before and damn she’s pretty 🥰💕
For as much hype as this song got the video is just mehhhhh

the beginning looked like a transformers commercial
I NEED EVERYBODY'S @

Kylo Ren owns this song
Que mulher perfeita MDS ❤️😍🇧🇷
Oi Galera, eu fiz meu primeiro cover, pode não está com uma qualidade boa, mais queria pedir o apoio de vocês! Não quero ser chato, mais se você puder e quiser passar no meu canal(e mesmo que for pra dá uma crítica construtiva) eu ficarei grato, e não tenho uma voz tão boa assim. Muito obrigado se você leu até aqui🤧❤

You can tell she had CHEMISTRY with that dude. Y’all know who I’m talking about mhmmmn.
I like how she’s still sexy and classy. No raunchy lyrics. ❤️
I need the names of all the models in this video 😍😍
What happened to her little titties and fat belly
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 Princess Nokia💓💓💯💯💯🌠🌠🌠⭐⭐✅

2:30 is she pregnant?
So long story short... I'd never be able to pick her out of a line up
Viral song in tik tok 🥵
She stiff. But good song.
You will go down as one of the greatest female rappers in history. Its just a matter of time🔥🔥🔥

She's a shape shifting bitch and I love it 🖤
This reminds me of G.O.A.T I'm an absolute Destiny fan ❤️❤️❤️
I've been seeing this song on TikTok for the past 6 months and had no idea it was her omg Princess Nokia constantly serving bops
Never knew of her until just now 😳😍 dope ass video !
Like Nokia the phone?
He my man 😚 he my boo ☺️
I feel like this video did not go with the song
Oh wow she got a boob job...no more little t****es .. time to remix the "tomboy song now 🤣🤣🤣
i like her.
**cough** beats promo!!
10/10 casting
Nice melody 🎶😌 I wrote a song called *Love Me Before You by ninanile*. Please check it out on my channel✨
Her, Rubi Rose, and BIA all have that nice raspy deep rap voice 😍😍
Who is the ginger guy @ 2:32???
I’ve been waiting on this. 🤩
Yeah, this every girl saying “I have x amount of crushes” THOSE MEN IN THE VIDEO ARE MY TYPE
This is not how I envisioned the video aesthetic .. playing a more baby-girl innocent yet baddie role maybe in a court yard or school setting with a few other girls fan girling over hot guys would have come along nicely video still good tho
One thing abt princess Nokia, her videos are gna slap EVERYTIME.
I remember Taylor Swift mentioned her on her speech last year at billboard artist of the decade
gorgeous!!
She’s so pretty omg 😍😍😍 & her rap voice is perfect!! 😩 I just need her and Rubi Rose to do a song one time 🙏🏽
Y’all talking about jlo 🛑 this was Aaliyah and #Nivea and #sisqo thong song 🙄 know y’all 2000s pleaseeee!
This is a confusing video
Bluecanteral * is that you 😍😍😍
this was in my recommended and i didn't even realize the song till I heard the dialing and "and we just made a  banger"
JLo vibes . Nokia you're so sexy boo
GEMINIS QUEEN
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes. Yes. Yes!
why is this not above WAP ?
🔥🔥🔥💃🏾💃🏾
I thought she was lesbian
Amei !😍
Im conflicted over this on one hand i hear trash but then i also hear a bop
I like that she has a relatable body and not some fake big ass and boobs. And men tho 😍.. some many different guys!! 😋
She look different every time I see her! Lol what the heck!
tanked lmao
blk mirror
SHE IS SO FUCKING GORGEROUS👁️👄👁️
Anyone notice there's that same hallway scene from Bartier Cardi 😭
https://www.instagram.com/p/CEiTl_yBKcT/?igshid=nm8ds099v41p
I can't keep up. You look different everytime. Consistently serving with your creativity.

When the song went *BEEP BOOP BEEP BEEP BOP* it resonated with me 😔
If you listen cloosely at the star of the video you can hear the Nokia ringtone at the start of the video

I just sent my sister the clip of Spiritual Solitude. I'll keep riding as long as that SPIRIT stay up.  Not everybody needs to do the "WAP" type thing to get even more recognition but I'll stop now before I'm misunderstood. Princess Nokia is always beautiful, regardless. ✌🏿
No ones talking about the diversity of the men in the video    Edit: I appreciate all the likes guys😄😄
Just saw this on my recommendations- 🤯
Plot twist: She reinvent nokia 3310
1:19 look at his face 😂
She's a fucking goddess ♡
It’s the checkered floor, the one eye reference, the shh hand sign and the baphomet sign in the beginning for me... watch her get huge now in the industry, I’m telling  y’all. I love her but that’s the true

Imagine walking down the street not knowing you just walked past princess Nokia....       *because she never looks the same*
There was suppose to be a girl swiping on Tinder and going to the dates in this video
She looks different in every music video. I’m really beginning to believe that she’s a chameleon
why she sit down like that LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YAAAASSSSSSS BEEN READY !!
💙Giving me Jennifer Lopez If you had my love vibes but with futuristic vibes. 🔥🔥🔥

She has potential.
I've loved her since Versace Hottie. Fucking QUEEN
I like her, like the song but ehhhh. Wish the video was better tho.
Princess Nokia makes me feel so good about my body because she looks like every body else and her waist isn't microscopic nor are her boobs ginormous. Who else with the little bitty titty committee?! That being said all bodies are beautiful bodies, and deserve respect. 🙌 💖
VOODOO CLAM

3:10 THE WAY MY EYES WIDENED- NOKIA I WASN'T READY 💀

No mms que loco. Amo esta canción.💗
Guys please repent to Jesus before its too late...people are dying like flies out here
Someone on Twitter said she’s giving Diet tinashe and I agree

YESSSS NOKIAAAAAA
I was waiting on her to drop some vocals then boom 💥😮I’m hooked
💫
She has impeccable taste. <3
legenddd
We need more videos like this 🤯🤬 #90sBabiesStandUp
Been waiting for this video!!!
meu deus é a patroa
Wait but did miss thing have work done or did the makeup artist do a damn good job of reshaping her face ???
she looks so stunning... I love the looks in this video
Best video.
The beginning confuses me. I feel like they were trolling us. It’s supposed to be futuristic with that old ass computer? You can generate images from your mind but you still need a keyboard? Lol AND she almost sat too far down the chair.🤣
Yes
I was like ohh new music... But I wasn't disappointed, The muted out glamoro shots was all the range for the Hispanic girls in my school, I was always jelly
This was a sick concept it was her in a virtual reality choosing all the men she wanted . and exspirenceing them through that technology . supet cyber punk but also had a nostalgia twist with all the diffrent boyfriends
A video full of fine ass men...bout time....
who is the man of 0:41??? <3
I never know what to expect from her, she's super exciting to follow. sometimes her experiments and new styles fall flat but when she's pulling out something great, it's indeed fucking great.
My Favorite Gemini💙💙💙
She got her nut n dipped
Black mirror type shit
Every time she pops up she looks different and I love that about her.
Succubus really out here
Woaowww i like that❤❤❤
THANK YOU for the Birthday Video!!! My Fav Song!! xoxo
I've waited so long
she's the definition of versatile
I swear this lady is a shape shifter
I miss the princess from Brujas and Tomboy :(
Bitch I'm screaming yes
the song is really good the clip is dissapointing for me
my brain is not able to process how this doesn't even look like her
I love a futuristic music video.
The visuals and concept is so creative.
I love this!💕
Feels like it’s a bit not her, too polished, for me she will always represent this Balenciaga/Kitana ruff tomboy aesthetics with this natural lighting. THAT GIRL with the best lyrics video ever. She’s growing no doubt but the video feels like it’s not her idea. Like someone tries to mend her in popular cliche.  I will stand for Princess Nokia no matter what.  But happy and comfortable Princess Nokia makes me happy and comfortable.
I like her taste in men. Def not typical. Very daddy vibes
This is waaay better than wap.
Feel like we've been waiting for too long for this video. Thank you for blessing us!
In this video you can see the woman that is princessnokia, creative, sexy, savage, Beautiful, man she is fireee
Beats must be doing promo. I done seen them damn headphones in like 10 different videos
An absolute masterpiece! My Gemini queen, you are an amazing actress and artist. Without the intimate energy between you and your beautiful costars (which I’m sure there was full consent for you to touch them for for them to touch you etc..) this video would not be the same! Your music videos always feel more like a film to me. There’s always a story and you tell it beautifully. Well done once again 😍❤️❤️
she looks different every time i see her... i know a gemini when i see one
She fine af
This aesthetic is everything
JLO?!?!?!
Te amo princess desde Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 💛
YESSS let him brush your hair boo be treated like the princess you are!
Okay BABYYY Hood Version of JLO 💁🏽‍♀️ lol , 😝 she kilt THIS !
All of her outfits are on POINT
She just made a Banger
I’ve been waiting for this
YAAAAAS another one
Bored...
I love this song 🎵
She doing dumb video now, I see the illumination
ig baddie nokia make me so uncomfortable...wheres the brown lipstick?
That's It I'm polyamorous now
This on some matrix level type shidd and i love it
I like big, big boys, itty bitty, Mississippi boys, inner city boys

perfeitinha
Gostava da garota do gueto, q falava da barriguinha e de n ter peito era da hora, adoro essa música, mas esse clipe 🥴

Sis!!!!! Siiiiiiisssss WHATTTTTTT FIRE.
I just discovered you & I’m already in love 🥵💖
I love this
The song and video is EVERYTHING ✨
Look sis I am a symp for dystopian future ish. But this video missed the mark, I was a little confused and found myself putting the s*** together on my own, what you should never have to do as the viewer ....so close to what I'm sure you were trying to get. Just missed the mark a tad   bruja for life tho!!
Female Rappers are everywhere this year
this song is a hit , shes bomb asf , the visuals were GREATTTTTTTTTT
NOT SHE CAME THROUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
And that's that on that. Periodt!
That first 20 seconds when she nearly accidentally misses the chair going to sit down really got me howling haha - bless her soul love her so much! Video is mega 🌸
*That late 90s and early 2000s vibez!* 💖
I grew up with very low self-esteem, having been labeled the difficult child in my family. I was an unplanned baby, and my parents already had one child—a girl, so they really wanted a boy. They were disappointed when I turned out to be a girl and even considered giving me to a paternal family member who did not have children."  "My dad comes from a very cold, strict family, and he has a very bad temper, so I grew up naturally fearful of him and always felt like I was walking on eggshells around him. My mom also grew up in a household where she had not received love. Both my parents are extreme perfectionists, very organized, and raised us with military discipline and no compassion."  "Thus, I could never relate to God as a Father. God was unapproachable and sitting with a lightning bolt ready to strike me whenever I wasn't good enough, didn't pray enough, or wasn't obedient enough.I was under the impression that God was only pleased with me when I obeyed the law, that I never met His expectations, and I was always under condemnation."  "Since encountering your teaching resources, the veil in my life has been torn. For the first time, I am free. I no longer walk under the heavy burden of condemnation. I learned that God loved us first, and I can now have a love relationship with my heavenly Father and Jesus."  "I have experienced victory over fear and sin that kept me captive for years—not by trying to be obedient, but by just learning that my sins have already been forgiven on the cross. And no, I am not sinning more now. I am actually overcoming more and sinning less, and I have a grateful heart for what Christ has done on the cross."  Do you feel as though you are never good enough, can never do enough and be obedient enough for God to love and acceptyou? Do you feel you are always living under perpetual condemnation? Perhaps you can't relate to God as a loving Father because you've never experienced the love of your earthly father or because your own father has hurt you terribly.  My friend, I pray that as you begin to meditate on today's verse, you will supernaturally experience the intimate love of your heavenly Father in a deep and personal way as never before. I pray that this experience will heal, renew, restore, and transform you in a spectacular way because His love for you is nothing less than spectacular.
Pues qué cagada, el lyric vídeo para mi estaba estupendo ya. Sale preciosa pero me he quedado un poco así :|

2:19 I LIKE HIM PRINCESS NOKIA GIVE ME THIS ASIAN BABY😫
I love u
Mannn I love my noki but this wasn’t it for me, I wish her dancing was more on beat.. and don’t really like how she’s submissive on the floor. I envisioned it more of her picking which men she likes not just them being modeled on the screen but her sort of picking and choosing them. Wasn’t feeling the video from the intro like nooo she’s really a BOSS BITCH. Idk who directed this video but I love you Noki some part of the video were MAD MAD DOPE I just wish it continued through out
I'm just waiting for Princess Samsung.

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18  Have a blessed day.

T amo s2
God is light and in him is no darkness at all. We were born in darkness and in sin and by it, the sting of death has spread to all for the wages of sin is death. All of the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Now the unrighteous are adulterers, fornicators, idolaters, sorcerers, the covetous, murderers, revilers, extortioners, drunkards, and the like such, are these who will NOT enter into God’s kingdom. BUT, the gift of God is eternal life in his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ who gave himself for the sins of the world. Being as a lamb without spot or blemish he did no sin in his life and by merit of his own righteousness he was anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power, by which he also was risen from the grave and ascended into heaven, having ALL power in heaven and in earth.   Before Jesus ascended into heaven he commanded his disciples to go into ALL the world and preach the GOSPEL! He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned. Repentance and remission of sins must be preached in the name of JESUS in ALL nations. Therefore the apostles preached this:  REPENT! All you that are here, STOP what you are doing, which you blindly do in the darkness you’ve been so accustomed to and START reading God’s word and OBEYING IT. Be BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS! This is straight forward to little children who do as their father commands them. Without baptism in the name of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ has NOT covered you and remitted your sins, thus making you the children of God’s wrath. Then, ye shall receive the gift of the HOLY GHOST. This is the Spirit of Christ, which will be manifest by speaking with other tongues and prophesying, and enables you to walk in the only righteousness that there is, Jesus Christ.   Of yourselves, that is in your flesh, lieth no good thing at all, and they that are after the flesh will perish. But they after the Spirit will bear fruit unto God that is pleasing in his sight. Not according to the emulations of men who seek to justify themselves by going to a church building, watching a YouTube video, or going to a seminary. But according to the natural working of the true vine which causeth the branches that abide in it to bear fruit. Blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates and into the city!
omg yes!!!!!!!!!
One thing y’all need to know tho is @SnowyTexas was in the song to I wonder why she wasn’t in this video hmm. It’s a good video she still fine but would’ve been great to see both artist that are in the song in it.
Every single one of those men where fine as hell, a bitch was going CROSSEYED trynna keep up 💀💀💀💀
Better than WAP 💅🏼🤷🏽‍♀️
ngl, it makes me so happy to see a coloured woman with a flat ass wearing revealing clothes feeling confident, sexy & slaying the outfit around different types of men.  nowadays we more often than not see female rappers with fat asses that are able to do that. makes me feel like I cant wear or pull off those clothes unless I got slim arms, thick thighs and a big ass. Thank you for representing us lil booty girls princess nokia xx
This needs to be on a disney chamnel....
Her biggest production , this is so amazing
She is always in a costume, today we see her JLO  2000s wanna be

Wooow a queen
What I love about her most is she doesn’t have the fake Instagram body look like so many other artists, she has normal body type & isn’t afraid to show it off & she looks just as beautiful if not more beautiful than the other women in her industry. ❤️
🔥🔥🔥
The girls are SITTING 😍 love the visuals 👏🏽
Bro how does she look so different we stan
Princesa Nokia just never disappoints
On some sense 8 shit
Princess Nokia is just Fuckin Gorgeous!!!!!!
Daddy

And she can go tomboy to queen!!!??? I stan😍😍
Yhoooo I did not expect this! I highkey still like the cartoon one but I’m sure it was fun for her to make this
The 2000's Jlo influence is deep  That Asian man was fine af👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥🔥
I have a hard time finding these girls beautiful. They arent even real
I'm here before a million who else raise your hand?!?!? 👋🏿👋🏿👋🏿👋🏿
Hipnotizing dont explain shit ✨✨✨
Not enough ppl are talking abt how crazy this video is. This shit was hard, like on another level.

I searched “cause I’m all about him him him” then saw this saying *9 hours ago* so I’m like let me give it a shot
I love you so much Princess Nokia
I love Princess Nokia and this concept so much, this video says so much about the real need for mens fulfillment on this land today. We all need to relearn what it means to truly embody sacred masculine and sacred feminine. As someone who has worked on myself a lot spiritually, i devote myself as a woman and a very good one at that and there are so many men whose life i know i could make a whole lot better with my true embodied self as i am and i wish there were more folks being their true selves embodied so there wasn’t such a loneliness pandemic amongst humans on this plant
OH MY GOD YES!!!!!!!!!
Wow loved this matrix 4 trailer hahaha
the men 😍🤤

this videos set decoration was definitely influenced by if you had my love
the way she served... impeccable.
She looks amazing
Loving the evolution 👑
Love the concept. All it’s missing is some bad ass dancers or vibey choreography
This deserves wayyyy more hype.

La conozco desde que escuché Brujas, y me voló la mente, es una de las artistas más talentosas y originales que tuve la oportunidad de escuchar, pero debo admitir que extraño mucho el estilo underground que tenía en sus comienzos, de todas formas es increíble y la amo siempre!! I've known her since I heard Brujas, and it blew my mind, she is one of the most talented and original artists that I had the opportunity to listen to, but I must admit that I really miss the underground style she had in her early days, she is incredible anyways and I love her!
I loved her since tomboy!! I’m so happy to see her growth and to see her blowing up 🖤🖤
*I like her* *I like this*
