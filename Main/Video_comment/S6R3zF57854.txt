She's so real and shows her truth here on yt that that obviously would never be shown on tv air
I can relate to this 100%! The before is how my crap is.... I need HeLp! 😬
Love hannah 🤘😋
Relatable. I'm super clean yet somehow at the same time super messy...
idk i kinda liked the mess. Reminds me of my room hahaha id come over and feel right at home😂
I just love how authentic and real Hannah is. I really hope she doesn't change while living in LA. It seems like everyone out there morphs into the same fake, "perfect" do no wrong type of person. It makes me sad and it seems the world is having a harder time connecting because no one shows their true selves anymore. I love watching Hannah because I feel like were friends. She's real.
give me one pair of shoes please
Can you please do a room tour and or a house tour?!? I love your style and want to know where you got all of your beautiful pieces!!
Hannah, you are my favorite bachelorette to date. i was so excited to see you start a youtube to take us all along on your adventures. i love love love your realness and hope you never abandon that. i wish you the best and know you will find it. ✌🏼❤️
U need to keep it that way it’s not hard ❤️
Omg! This is me too! 😩 I need a total reorganization of my stuff too.
Wow. That before is disgusting. Yuk.
Hannah is the cutest!!! I love her. I didn’t like her on the bachelor thinking she’s a mean girl. But she’s actually so sweet and easy going.
Very relatable Hannah I encourage You to fight to keep it that Way because is no easy😄but You will get use to it
❤❤❤❤
Your apartment is beautiful and love me some uber organization!
Time to do a give away! Pretty sure things get bought bc you can't find what you need! Next up: capsule wardrobe time!
Love you so much Hannah! ROLL TIDE BABYGURL 🐘🏈❤️❤️❤️❤️
It's all about the storage bins...I/we just spent TWO months purging  Every Room and our home!  I did mean getting rid of some things also 🙃 But,  the clear plastic  Pantry bins , we even put some in our refrigerators for condiments and vitamins etc.
All I could think: Where can I get that blanket/robe/sweater thing???
Her clothes look like a clothing store
You should’ve called The Home Edit ✨
Ok, how in the heck did your BRAND NEW APARTMENT that you just moved into get THAT messy, THAT quick??? Like, who lives like this??? 🤦🏻‍♀️
I need to know where the buy those white mesh bins in the guest room closet
How many jeans does one need...shopaholic?
"I have 4,482 knives."  1. She counted that? 2. "I don't think anyone needs that many." Why did she buy that many to begin with?  "Now it's time to look at your drawers." :D   She's thinking the room is so pretty. I'm thinking SHE is so pretty.
I am curious if anything was went thru first to give away or just organized everything without going thru it all. Looks great today. I have done my drawers and closet same way, only everything by color , even hanging stuff. Each category is hung by color coordination. It does make such a big difference. Good luck Hannah. It will make life much easier
Disclaimer: More than half the budget for this organization was spent on the clear acrylic shoe bins in her walk in closet. Lmao.
I would have a hard time having other people go through my stuff.  I would need to decide for myself what to keep and throw out.
Ahhh Hannah brown your looking for love and a  lot of good looking successful guys would date you but they would date you for your name and looks you want a guy your crazy about that’s also crazy not only for your looks but  crazy  for your personality too
Yes 💗🤣🤣❣️
Bro I’m poor af I have no clothes damn love it!
Okay, is it weird I would love to see a pajama faves video?? 😱
Hannah save your money invest...
Finally someone else with a massive amount of clothes. All the organization videos have people with massive closets or are minimalists. I feel better knowing someone else had my closet anxiety. These ladies did a wonderful job. Wish I could get them to do my house! 💕
What a transformation!  You're so fun to watch.
Make a video showing us some of your workout routines and what you eat in a day pleaseeee
This makes me feel so much better about my room lol but this makes me want to clean and organize mine or even hire them for myself 😂
Hey Hannah Roll Tide!!!! ♥️🐘🏈
Wow flashbacks to when I was a kid we used to watch Clean Sweep and Mission: Organization.  This type of thing is really difficult to do with your own stuff, so it's very helpful to have someone there but I am surprised Hannah wasn't there when they were sorting through things.  I guess it's hard to imagine someone going through my stuff without me being there to manage haha
It looks great now!!!❤️🙏
YESSS just subscribed finding out you have a yt channel just made my day.
I don’t have nearly that much stuff but it would be such a dream for someone to come organize my crap for me
Amazing. I need them or another company like them in my life 😂
OMG, I need help to... gives me a ton of anxiety when shits not organized!! Help Me? Lmao 😝😝😝🤭😅
She’s still playing a role, she ain’t no dummy 😂capitalizing on it
Gosh after seeing her all glammed up.. I never would have thought she was that big of a slob. Hopefully she will maintain what they did for her.
Love love love the acrylic shoe storage bins!!!
This was so refreshingly normal and I’m here for it
I got anxious in the closet too, wow. I’ve adopted minimalism though so I’ve gotten rid of so many clothes and shoes. I swear I get ready in 5 mins now. I’m still in shock everytime I get ready so fast; my fiancé still mentions it too and it’s been a while now 😂😅
Weird, how she has this YouTube channel but doesn’t make the effort to respond to any comments. It’s like she’s above everyone. Why have a channel and act like you care for your bachelor fans but you don’t acknowledge them.
this has inspired me to organize my closet today! lol
OMG WE HAVE THE EXACT DISNEY PILLOW PETS! I’M DYING 😭😭😭
Uhm how do I hire them
The people stood around in their phones would irritate the sh/t out of me. There’s already a camera crew here so get lost.
The comments on judging Hannah are the same ones you criticize trolls for doing. Watch her videos. Learn. Grow. Get some great ideas and be thankful. 💙🦋💙🦋💙
keep us posted how long it stays like this, lol beautiful!!! how did you sleep in that bed?
Don’t worry my room was like that, but I organized it as well!
I like how the home edit organizes things better 😂
My favorite girl!! Love u Hannah!! Your apartment is beautiful!! So wish I lived by you, it would be so fun and interesting!! Love this channel!! You brighten my day every time with your vlogs !! Just love watching u, your so real and raw and that is so awesome !! 💜😘
I so need this!!
Was this filmed before Covid?
I AM SO HAPPY YOU MADE A CHANNEL. this is great you are great!!! will you please do an apartment tour, and say where you purchased all your furniture/pillows/etc. I LOVE your style, it looks so cute. dying to know where you got your couch
Just want to know how they folded everything. Teach me your ways.
We need an update video on how long Hannah was able to keep her apartment organized. Lol
This video is so relatable
I really hate to say this,... but this channel is making me like Hannah. 😩 Im starting to see what you guys see. Lol
The transformation is definitely wow 🤩
Looks so good!!! I need to do this and get rid of stuff !
I like this Hannah on youtube. 😁 As the bachelorette I didn't feel like I could relate to you and the drama was priority. As this, I feel like we could be friends and have a lot in common. Can't wait to keep watching!!
Thatd be cool to work as an organizer
Love that woman no matter what.  Then my thoughts immediately went to the day(s) when she moved all that stuff into the apartment.  After seeing all the clothes...thank goodness for laundry service ♥  Made me chuckle when I saw the pantry with baking ingredients ... cookies some day maybe? ♥
Where is that earthy dresser in her room from? I love it!
Now that “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” is over I’m ready for “Keeping Up with Hannah B” yassss
i love these channels so much
Hopefully Hannah can keep it this clean
I love it. It looks so good
Who needs that much STUFF.  Seriously
I have the same vacuum 😁
idk why i thought that the celebrities have to give the mirror ball trophy back
ummmm show us all your PJ collection!! im obsessed.
Hannah’s YouTube is one of my favorite things that has happened in 2020 🙌🏼
What a cruel joke. Whoever decorated should be shot. No taste what so ever
This is great improvement but nobody organizes like the home edit ladies haha their level of perfection is just beyooonnnd
So where did they hide the Ugg’s and cowgirl boots, I have bedrooms/2 closets and...had to leave 1/2 my of boots at my mom’s in Mass Those take up so much space !!!  I do baskets of boots 🥾, socks, STUFF 🤦🏼‍♀️
Where do you get your cute pj sets from?!
Now just to keep everything all straighten up. Lol
She needs to come out of the closet:)
she seems like a messy, dirty person... not showering in multiple days??? never seeing the bed clean without clothes??? HUH?!
She need to Marie condo her space
Holy shit she has so much clothes haha
You need to go thru your stuff and donate half of it.
Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and form; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death. But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Sin according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23).  Everyone has turned to their own ways trying to determine for themselves what is right and wrong. Humanity are lovers of sin rather than lovers of God. As a result, God has given us over to a depraved mind that lust after shameful things. Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins; with diseases/sickness, natural disasters, riots, racism, etc. All manner of evil plagues the world because we sinned against God. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. So Death is an arresting officer that brings you into the courtroom of God. "The soul that sins shall die" "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law. He's so serious about sin that he gave anyone who sins the Death sentence. The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth'' (Matthew 13:42)  Do you think you're Good enough to enter heaven safely when you die? Here's how you can be sure:  A Test: based on the 10 commandments 1. Thou shall have no other gods before me. 2. Thou shall have no idol. 3. Thou shall not take God's name in vain. 4. Thou shall honor the day of Sabbath. 5. Honor thou mother and father.6. Thou shall not murder. 7. Thou shall not commit adultery. 8. Thou shall not steal.9. Thou shall not lie. 10. Thou shall not covet.  - Have you ever lied in your life?• Jesus said whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery in the heart,- Have you ever looked at anyone with lust?‐ Have you used God's name as a curse word?- Have you ever stolen anything big or small?- Have you ever Hated someone?• Jesus considers it as murder in the bible.  If you said yes to just one of them then you're already guilty in God's eyes " for whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just  one point is guilty of breaking all of it. " (James 2:10) Therefore, God says " neither liars, nor blasphemers, nor adulterers, nor thieves nor murderers will inherit the kingdom of God". You have to face God on judgement day with all of your sin, even the secret ones."The soul that sins shall die "(Ezekiel 18:4) and they are destined for Hell  Don't rely on your own Goodness or Good works to save you. Do not be deceived neither you, your friends, family, a priest, a pastor, religion, nor attending a church can save you. That's like bribing God to let you into heaven. "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," (Romans 3:23)"But we are all like an unclean thing, and all of our righteousness are like filthy rags; we fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like wind have taken us away." (Isaiah 64:6) "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; Who can know it? (Jeremiah 17:9)  God's definition of "Good" is morally excellent and none of us can match his goodness. "No one is good except God alone." (Luke 18:19) Because he is a Good God, he's a lover of righteousness and justice, he must punish all who sin. God cannot simply forgive you alone for your sins because his wrath against all sinners must be satisfied. But God takes no pleasure in sending anyone to hell, God wants to forgive you for your sins.  Do you know what he did for guilty sinners?  2000 years ago, God became a human being, "God was manifested in the flesh"( Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God.)  “He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem. Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.  But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed  we all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers was silent, so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgement he was taken away. Yet who of his generation protested? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was punished. He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.  Yet it was the LORD'S will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offering and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death and was numbered with transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. (Isaiah 53: 2-12)  The Ten Commandments are called the moral law, we broke the law Jesus paid the fine. So God can let you go even though you're guilty. "He saved us not because of righteous things we've done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit" (Titus 3:5)  "God demonstrates his own love towards us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8) "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) "Death was swallowed up in victory." (1 Corinthians 15:54)  (1) All you need to do is confess and repent ( turning away completely) from all your sins to God alone; no other person.  "He who covers his sin will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy."  (Proverbs 28:13)   "If we confess our sins, he is faithful to and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9)  "Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord." (Acts 3:19)  Repentance is a continual process and not a one time thing.  (2) Have Faith in Jesus Christ alone, trusting him like a parachute on the day of God's wrath.  "Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what is not seen " (Hebrews 11:1)  If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. (Romans 10:9-10)  "For by grace you are saved through faith and not that of yourselves; it is a free gift of god, not of works, lest anyone should boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9)  (3) Then surrender to God by letting God guide you in all your ways, through the bible; KJV recommended. Only God can save you not people.  "For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. it teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and live self controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age," (Titus 2:11-12)  "For Christ also suffered once for sins, just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God. "(1 Peter 3:18)  Through Jesus you'll be born again.  "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." (John 3:3)   Jesus you will be given a new heart that desires righteousness and what is Just.  "For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. (2 Corinthians 5:21) "This righteousness is given through Faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe." (Romans 3:22)  "In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins in accordance with the riches of God's Grace that he lavished on us." (Ephesians 1:1-8)  You'll be free from the control of sin through Jesus and you'll be added to his new family.   " His purpose was to create in himself a new humanity " (Ephesians 2:15)  "But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature;" (Galatians 5:13)  When Are You Going To Get Right With God?  Remember this is your eternal life and God is offering it as a free gift in Jesus Christ. "Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among  men by which we must be saved." (Acts 4:12)  You either believe or reject this offer, It's your choice. I'll leave you with this: "What shall profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? " (Mark 8:36)   If you're taking this seriously, Would you like a prayer? This prayer is not a guarantee that you'll be saved, that's between you and God. However, I'd like this to be a good start for your journey.       "Father, I thank you for this person's open heart and ask that he/she would repent and trust alone in Jesus christ. I also ask that you guide their steps on their journey so that they would pass from death to life. In Jesus name amen.
reverences diddles
Lol at least her place is actually lived in  I love the realness of Hannah  Very refreshing to see these days
this is so charming I love the south
So good!!
She is never gonna be able to keep it this organized, at least i couldn't haha
the casual DWTS mirror ball in the background
JESUS is coming soon. Repent from your sins and turn to HIM. The gates of heaven is open for all. He loves you and is Lord. Repent and go to Him.
OMG i love this!!!!!!!
*me judging the hell out of Hannah for her messy apartment knowing damn well if I had my own place it would be just as crazy*
also is the home sort like the same thing as the home edit? i just recently watched home edit on netflix
Looks awesome!! I need to do the labels. Great idea!
Who needs that much stuff?
You need to make a cute intro and outro!!! Luv you Hannah b
Omg it’s the labeling the drawers for me!
HB you are cutie and crack me up I love to watch you keep up those videos. 😂😘
HEEEEY! I hope everyone is having a great day!😁 if anyone here supports LGBTQ you should checkout our channel🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Where is your bedroom rug from?!
Idk what’s  up but then sound on your videos is weird
SHE SEEMS SO FUN TO BE AROUND WITH. LOVE HER VIBE❤❤❤
Great video Hannah!
I am so happy that you have done this I love you so much and ROLL TIDE ❤️❤️❤️
Such a fun video! I think the only thing I wouldn't like is having my bras/underwear/socks/pajamas over in the guest room haha
Love this but you need to know how to fold and have the right habits... Im surprised when people dont have these habits instilled when growing up. Hopefully she learns now
“Catching flies” - Where was she last night at the debate? 😉
Totally changes your life, keep it up girl :)
Where is the dresser from?
Laziness....pure laziness.
We need an update to see if you kept it this organized! I am constantly organizing and then one event and its destroyed :)
Need Marie Kondo lol
Can someone post a link to the shoe storage units? (5:28 mark)
Meow
This is futile without a behavior change Hannah😑
Now the goal is to maintain this organization.
Feeling the need to just mention wearing a mask inside especially would be a good example to set.
I absolutely love these kinds of videos!
why are you so messy Hannah?
Girl, you’ve already got 107k subscribers!!! Way to go!!! 😊
Do a de clutter video ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have so many questions about the amount of jeans she owns 😳😍
A week on YouTube and already a 107k subs 😱😱
no one needs that much stuff
❤️
i love hannah!!!🥺
IDK why but I was expecting a major purge of some of her clothing. I guess I've just watched too many minimalist/Marie Kondo videos, LOL!
Impressive! I think we all should give time to be organized,  it brings discipline in our life. Waiting for your interior designing video
Damn Hannah. That apartment cant really be that messy
A moment just hit and I realized 'we are going to see so much more of Hannah with this channel', I am so happy!
Love
Wow her channel is picking up fast... That's cos she is real and not some fake girl trying to show off a perfect life of designer stuff. All those barbies you see on Youtube are putting it on for the camera.
That dancing with the Stars trophy is a huge flex
This makes me want to organize my closet! 😂
Loved this video and can’t wait to see more!
Shes cute but messy lol
Ummmm this is MY place lol
I love the fact that she is so comfortable to show how disorganize she is which is ok because I am disorganized and everybody has that one messy place in their house or multiple messes.
Just luv the heck out of you Hannah. Have a good nite🌛
She's so open, quirky in a good way and just a nice person to me! 😃
Aw, I love Leslie and Christy! So glad they got to come help you out!!
you are really one of my favorite people ever. i love you so much. thank you for starting a channel
At some you’ll have to move to another house or apartment because your clothes are taking over the whole room
Don’t toss things out, donate to people in need. 😊
Love that Hannah is real!! Nothing fake about her!
I love you hannah! You have grown on me. It is amazing that you are being so vulnerable and humble. I love this! It was so satisfying the transformation but also you being so honest that you aren't a clean person and needed help to make your space better.  Home Edit vibes. I am a hannah fan now! I also love your accent 🤣❤
Omg a Coach Eric Taylor shirt! I need
such a satisfying video wow
Pajama tour please
Love it! Haha can they come to my house please!
Seriously you are my favorite!!!
I love watching these  but I know from experience if you don’t go through the motions of organizing things yourself the systems won’t continue to function. Good luck Hannah!!
Can I please have the blanket you had on..... omg  love.
That apartment is amazing! Love her decorating style. Hope she does some interior decorating videos
the decluttering is so satisfying
Hannah is so cute and honest!! Love her
I’m wondering if they showed her how to fold those things back into the drawers? Idk. Just a random thought. Everything looks amazing!!
I love how relax / real Hannah is. She goes on camera bare face, hair up, w/ a blanket draped over her lol. This is why ppl tune in. She’s so real, cute, & just an overall beautiful mess in the best way possible. 💖
Loved it!!!!! Amazing. You should have turned the second bedroom into a walk in closet
I thought I was messy but this is on another level 😅
Wow looks awesome Hannah!! Enjoy 💕
Your place looks great!  You should do another expensive taste test.  That was so hilarious.  Keep it going !
I love it!!!
MY FAVORITE KIND OF VIDEOS. YOU GIVE ME LIFE HB.
Awww. So glad you shared!  Very brave. ❤️. And my house looks like that, too, and I'm also working on being authentic and not hiding away the mess.
Hannah, you bring innocent joy during these tough times.  Thank you💞
3:12 into this and I have one, just one simple question. How long have you lived in this apartment?  I'm packing for a move, after living here 15 years so yes I'm a mess right now, but, wow...
I thought she was a interior decorator????
Having a clean, neat and organized apartment is so important energetically! You attract into your life what your home is like
I wonder how the home edit would've done it?
I love how Hannah can say oh I can have this to remember this time I won dwts no biggy
As an OCD person diagnosed by my fiancé I had anxiety the whole video but the end was comforting I’m an organized minimalist
holy Hannah I don't think I've ever seen a person more likeable than you. Thanks for such a fun video!
Do an apartment tour! Your furniture is so cute!
Hannah, it seems you've moved a lot in the last year since the Bachelorette and I remember you updated your room at your mom's during quarantine.  What's up with all the moving?  Your apartment beautiful!
So pretty ily please reply 🥰
I love you hannah!
congrats on your 100K subscribers!!! im so excited for you 🥳🥳🥳
I have so many questions about this video- how much time did it take the team to do?  How much does this cost? Did she edit first? What was the process? Looks a lot better though.  But I’m a minimalist and was shocked at the sheer amount of stuff
Gosh they are goood
They had their work cut out everything looks great🙌🏻
Love 💕
Hannah girl you’re a mess lol hahaha (we love it)
More denim!
She doesn’t get to look though her clothes to get rid of all the ones she doesn’t want 🤔
Is it just me or does her face look familiar?
I see familiar faces!!  You met "the twins" Leslie & Christy Johnston !! They are my pastor's daughters, love them and Love you too! What a cool surprise!       *Angel*
https://youtu.be/wYx1lrmZvoI
Where does she gets her pajamas?
I knew this was going to happen, I AM LOVING YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEOS SO MUCH! Wish they were everyday😂
Great job.  Gave me some ides.
Love this. Love you.
Congrats hannah 100k subscribers 🎉🎉🎉
I hope they taught you how to fold or offer a maintenance plan. 🤔🥰
This channel is the bomb.com 😁😁😁
Hannah! Do the staple “wavy hair Hannah” hair tutorial!!!
Congratulations on 100K subscribers...you go girl.
Is she a borderline hoarder?  i have so much unorganized junk also. Great job!!!!
I think this is the best YouTube video I have ever watched! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  well done Hannah!
Any clothes you don't wear or need seriously send them my way .....International shipping incl : ) Have fun Chica with the new organized closet!!
I definitely am more excited about this video than the last one
This is gonna last Hannah a week
Wow Hannah will you come do my house? Lol 😂  We can call it Hansformation.  💜💜💜💜I’m so happy for you, really.
She has WAYY TOO MANY CLOTHES. I think I have less than half that many clothes.
100k subscribers already!! Congrats!! And this was so satisfying to watch
Bro what this is beautiful and I’m so glad I’m not the only messy one haha
This reminds me of the episode where Chris Harrison meets you In Alabama and goes inside your family house and the closet was spilling out 😄 Amazing amazing job!!! And such great ideas!
Wow Hannah you being such happiness into my life! I might sound crazy but this video was so satisfying to watch. Oh and your apartment is beautiful! I wish you all the best in life❤️
Why do I think it won’t stay that way?  Lol!!!! But hey it is fantastic!!!!
So jealous.
I would mess it up the next day 😂
I’m sorry, but what one persons need over 70 pairs of shoes including 3 or 4 of the same type of black heel?😭🙈😅
Hannah please shower daily. Loved the cleanup. Great job.
Woot 100k here we come!!!
I’ve cleaned up like that before. Just don’t look under the bed🤣
An organized life is a better life overall. It's better for your brain and overall happiness. I love organizing so much I could do it for free.
Hannah you are inspiring me.!!!!
Hi Hannah! Can't wait to watch this! Where is your animal print ottoman/coffee table from!? I LOVE THAT!
this makes me want to get up and organize my room now lol
I just realized that you were on dancing with the stars ⭐️
HANNAH, WHERE ARE YOUR PAJAMAS FROM. SOS 😂😂
OMG, I don't know if anyone has ever experienced voluntarily getting rid of everything you own?  We moved across North America after selling everything except what fit into a 5 X 8 ft.  UHaul and a van that included our cats and two adults. We were debt free and I have never felt freer in my life!  I learned that the more we owned the more burdened I felt.  I realized it takes a lot of energy just to own things because they need to be looked after and we seem to feel a need to protect them.  The less I have the lighter I feel.  I'm never going back.
I literally just came from the mukbang video.
There is no way Hannah will wear all those shoes or wear all those clothes because she keeps buying more.  Why didn't she donate what she doesn't wear to charity?
This reminds me of that Friends episode where Ross dated that woman that had a messy apartment.
The moment I found out Hannah B is just as disorganized as me 😂
Roll Tide!
🙀😷
Just cant get over her saying the n word and laughing about it. You can miss me with her now
But will you keep it up! Lol.
Almost 100,000 subscribers in less than 2 weeks. So excited for you Hannah! Love you girl! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Hannah, love you girl. But seriously, downsize the amount of clothes in your closet. Aint no one feeling put together with ALL that fabric
I know there have only been a couple so far, but I thoroughly enjoy your videos. That’s all, carry on!
You make me smile each time I watch you. You are a joy and so authentic, keep up the good work. 🤗❤️ “it’s your Mimi”
🤩 live for organization like this
ILY
Goes to show you how much social media can hide 😂 had no idea from Hannah’s insta stories. Also love how happy you are 🥰 looks amazing
Hannah is too pure for these L.A. people you can tell they are all secretly judging her
Looks great❤️
Ok sweet Hannah, I feel like your mom talking, but we want a monthly accountability video! 😘❤️
this mess is my nightmare
omg so organized.
can you keep it like that?
these transformations are SO satisfying
Hannah read up on the konmari method by Marie kondo, she teaches you to change your ways for good!
OMG Hannah I love you. This was a super interesting video to watch. By the way I love how cute and simple your apartment is.
No disrespect but wasn’t Hannah an interior designer?
That mirrorball trophy in the back 😍😍
Awh her mirror ball ❤️
You are a great girl hannah, so real and relatable.  I hope you realize how much you touch others everywhere.  A great role model.
Wow! That’s a wonderful transformation. Those ladies need to do a tutorial on how to fold clothes
Your apartment is so cute Hannah!!
I mean no disrespect, but I do wonder if she will actually maintain all of that organization those ladies set up for her place. Update us in 6 months Hannah! ;)
Wow now I can't wait for her and her brother to run around in the inflatable dinosaur costumes
I love your energy 😙
