This game brings back memories this is the best game of the year that I will never forget about Go Seahawks I’m excited for this year season 2023 hopefully it will be even better I have a great memory watching this!!!!!💙💚🙂
Wilson should have stayed with the Seahawks.

God bless you guys Always keep God first 🙂
Watching this in 2022 and it is WEIRD not having fans in the stadium!!  I was watching and thinking something was strange.  Then realized there wasn't any crowd noise!!!  Definitely not a thing ANYONE'S experienced at a Seahawk home game until that season!

Carlos Dunlap and Kyler Murray, and Tyler Wilson went so good! The Seattle Seahawks won! Yay!
3 months later this was a close game if Dre Kirkpatrick didn’t punch metcalf the cardinals would’ve won because that’s 1 less touchdown for Seattle and by the end of the game the cardinals were at field goal range would’ve been like week 7 results

Bitcoin has seen a massive upswing over the past couple of days that brought a firm end to it's consolidation phase and is now allowing it to confront its key resistance around $12,000. This level has been holding strong resistance through this year,  any break above this level was met with heavy selling pressure that catalyzed intense selloffs, but hopefully bitcoin hopes to test the $12,000. It is pertinent to hold a good size of the asset before the year runs out and the most result I have gotten is trading using the signals provided by expert Mrs Jennifer , a professional when it comes to strategizing and trading generally within my first few weeks, i had traded and earned over 7btc on my 3btc which I have held for over 10 months, with no desirable results to show for.

Niners gettin key players back. Buried the Rams; now we gotta win against both birds. Gonna be some solid games. 💯
Russ didn't turn it over, they had a run game, d stepped up. Seattle needed that bad.
Ever since we got Carlos Dunlap this defense has been improving every week
Tight End: False starts  NFL: That's going on the highlight reel.
4:10. did he straight up fist bump the ref??
these highlights gets worse and worse as the years go on, they don't show replays of important plays/different angles. they also miss out on game changing plays fouls sack players getting hurt,ect.also when the commentators are saying important/interesting information they cut it out half way though 😡😡🤬
What a first game at Lumen Field! 💡⚡️
Is Metcalf still growing? I swear; the man gets a 1/2 inch taller each week... These 2 teams may wind up dissecting each other once again when the stakes are a bit higher...
Mark 16:17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
"ok finally a good game from seattle without heart atta... Ok nevermind."
love it
Love Them Seahawks 🍻✊✊✊😷

If chase edmonds could build some muscle like davante did he could turn into a leagues top 10

The Larry Fitzgerald touchdown catch to win the game was a pass interference.
I feel so bad for cardinal fans cause their o line sucks at the end we rushed with 3 players and got the sack
Pro tip: mute the sound to cancel out having to listen to "PASS IIIIIIIIISSSSSSS....." 👍
The refs should have to do the Safety Dance for a Safety.
Me trying to watch football add: USAA five minutes later USAA five minutes later USAA
Go Hawks 🤘🤩🤘
The pass Interference calls are so inconsistent and consistently bad. That was great coverage from Pat p
Wow what a best players
Good win for the Seahawks 👏
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can't believe how bad the Seahawks secondary is now....jeez
Good game nice playing bwith player nob6
Its awesome
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=125138689201464&id=335214686550733 REAL NEWS UPDATE. THIS IS WHERE YOU WILL HEAR IT FIRST. HE KNOWS TRUMP'S INNER CIRCLE PERSONALLY. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO FOLLOW HIM AND COMPARE AND CONTRAST WHAT YOU HEAR ON  MAINSTREAM MEDIA.
Awsm
It’s weird that they add crowd cheering noises even though there isn’t anyone there lol
At the end there should have been a graph showing all fouls of every single play
Props to the guy on the soundboard at 9:00 for remembering to turn on the "Angry crowd reaction to fight" noise.
And my favorite team is the Seahawks
I love football
YES!

Best thing about winning this game is we now have eagles, Washington, giants and jets all in a row!!😂
Cincinnati Bengals: We have the worst O-Line Cardinals: Hold my flag
I am so grateful to be alive today. My girlfriend saved my life last night. This is a selfie I took in the emergency room after having a severe allergic reaction to almonds. I went into anaphylaxis, meaning my face, my lips, my eyes, my tongue, and my throat all started swelling up rapidly, making it almost impossible for me to breathe. I also had a rash all over my entire body, and I was extremely red. Staying alive had never felt more difficult. At one point, my nasal passage was completely blocked, and it was getting more and more difficult to breathe. They shot me up with Benadryl, steroids, they gave me a breathing tube, and even other stuff that I can’t even remember, and it caused all of the swelling and the rash to go away. Because this was a severe allergic reaction, I need to continue taking steroids and Benadryl for the next week, because it is possible that the allergic reactions could come back at any point over the next week. The steroids and Benadryl make me feel like a zombie, and I really want to take care of my health, so this will be my main focus over the next week. I want to thank my amazing girlfriend, who made the decision to take me to the emergency room the second I started feeling itchy. I was hesitant about going, because I didn’t even want to believe this was actually happening. If it weren’t for my girlfriend driving me to the emergency room only minutes after eating the almonds, there is a good chance that I wouldn’t have made it according to the doctor. This has been without a doubt the hardest few days of my life, but I also look at them as the most important few days of my life. These moments have reminded me about what’s really important in life, and it has made me so grateful to even be here on this earth. I will be prioritizing my health over the next week, and I’ll post updates about how I feel. Thank you all for being patient during these difficult times. This week has been NUTS (too soon for jokes? 😅)
Don't be confused @ 3:16 cardinals score a td
Hello
Not Murry's Fault.
Wow it really looks like crap when the officiating is this bad and there's no crowd to shame them
I’m a huge Seahawks fan and that game was to easy for us on the run game we just crushed them on the rushing offense
At 7:03 after the field goal is going straight to get the 3 Points  Someone: *Damn!*
Way 2 step up DEE!!!
Guys get paid  millions a year and don't know what the count is.
Good game Kyler
Did the fighter jets fly over before this game?
Everyone saying tre clamped up d-hop when Jamal adams helped big time deep 🤦🏽‍♂️ gg Seattle. Hope to see y’all in the playoffs
Uniforms  look like exotic  frogs from the Amazon  Forest  !
Bro that that tackle at 8:56 was start to give me PTSD
Grande jogo.
Tbh the d actually did something good job 👏🏽
I already know Seattle won before watching because #30 of Seattle is on highlight....and same with all your posts...dont like that
I'm sure dk said something to cause penalty. There should have been no flag. Oh yea its Seattle where there is the 12 man. The ref...
strange they didnt show the 2 delay of games by the seagulls...fixed
Hey NFL, you edited out a TD from the highlights?
I want to share a testimony of my life to everyone. I was married for over 30 years with two kids, I love him so much cos we have known each other right from when we where kids. When he went for a vacation in France he meant a lady there that also came for vacation, so when he came back he was acting strange until he moved out from the house living me with the two kids and went to live with the woman he met in France. I was so confused and was seeking help everywhere, I didn't know what to do I tried every means nothing worked I was left to take care of my two kids with little income it was really difficult while my ex husband was lavishing his new girlfriend with gift and money.     After 4 years of having to raise my kids all alone I was reading an article online and found a testimony of a lady who posted about Dr Obudu who helped her get her man back after 72 hours, She asked me to contact him     I contacted him to help me bring back my husband and he asked me not to worry about it that the gods of his four fathers will do as my heart desires. He told me by 12 Hours my ex  will call. It was just like a dream to me and After 11Hours my ex husband called and told me he was coming back home to seek for my forgiveness, I was surprised when I saw him exactly 70 hours after the spell was cast and he started crying for forgiveness .     Right now I am the happiest woman on earth for what this great spell caster did for me and my husband.      you can contact Dr Obudu with him via Email or WhatsApp obuduyang@gmail.com or +1 503-773-9114.     He is the most honest guy I have ever met... What ever the problem is you are going through, Financial problem, relationship or marital problem, health problem or spiritual problem he is the best guy to bring you happiness and smile again. Contact him now and join me to share testimony..
Russel wilson the best qb in the world
GG to both squads. Arizona is fun to watch and I love Seattle. Tough division. Rams are good 49ers went to super bowl last year but are banged up.
How does an end zone fumble = 7 points? No explanation from this reel.
They must’ve missed the extra point
DRATS!
russel willson > patrick mahomes   (im not bias im a cardnials fan)
go seahawks
cool video. your channel is awesome. I play a ton of Basketball.
D.K , what an athlete
Fake fight was planned for that moment in the game...So its called a costly mistake...Changed the momentum...Seattle scores...Win game...Great game for battle for first place...Pure Entertainment😕
Cards won't win many more games. They got lucky with the bills, the team straight up sucks and the running/QB will be a nobody in 2 years 🙂 go Seahawks! An actual skilled team
why are the showing a false start as a highlight
Funny how the national fixed league work's???NFL
Editing sucked in this video....you dont jump from first quarter to fourth then back to first.....
It’s weird that they add crowd cheering noises even though there isn’t anyone there lol
You want to beat the Cardinals....just throw to Patrick Peterson's side, he gets toasted on a regular basis !
I LOVE HOW BUFFALO LOST ON A LUCKY HAILMARY N A WEEK B4 THAT TOTALLY EMBARRASSED SEATTLE IN ALL PHASES OF FOOTBALL BUT NO LUCK LEFT THIS WEEK ARIZONA.....DIGGS WILL FINISH AS #1 WR IN LEAGUE N J.ALLEN WILL PUT ON A SHOW IN THESE NXT FEW WEEKS (SAVE THIS TXT AS A RECEIPT) WATCH N SEE......
Kyler throws the most beautiful ball I’ve seen. Just an absolute dart.
Seahawks should be disqualified for wearing those hideous neon green jerseys .  in my 25 years of being an interior decorator and florist my delicate , sensitive eyes have never been so offended !
Tre flowers has to be the worst CB in the NFL.
Pass....CAUGHT!!
It’s nice to see that the SeaHawks christened Lumen Field by their big win that night.😀
7:16 bruh
Seattle Seahawks Won 28-21
Dam alot of voice cracks from Joe buck this year
4:10 Lockett check the ref
Go Hawks
If you try to fight D.K. Metcalf, it looks like a bad life decision
dunlap has more sacks in 3 games than clowney has had in 2 years...
I love so much Arizona playin'... Tweety is a wonderful wondeful player. A huge man indeed!!
I think NE will beat the Cardinals
0:48 Lmao did they use a drawing of Megatron for DK?
4:10 when the Ref fist bumps Lockett after that touchdown.... must have him on his fantasy line up tonight.
Whoever compiled the "highlights" didn't do a very good job.  Oh well.
Yes sir thats my Seahawks
K. Murray is like the young R. Wilson
6:35 I'm a Seattle fan and that was NOT PI
Cardinals sUpErbOwL cOnTeNdErS. Please. They should be 5-5 now.
NO CAP. Kyler m looked SOLID!

Welcome to Seattle we got the refs what you got?  skills 21 28 but if yall do go to the playoffs don't kiss ass to tom Brady give him a free chance to go to the super bowl again like last time sell out.
How many more penalties will you cause?  O-line for both teams: Yes
Same old number twenty one  -  can't tackle   -  can't tackle - can't tackle  -  time after time.  Come to think of it, Seattle hasn't had a really good player in the position that number twenty one plays now in five or six years.  Almost automatic first downs and catches made against him.  Come on, man - Pete?
Gracias por el video, ciertamente necesitaba esto. Me encuentro un poquito nervioso, he de admitir que luego de leer la página de Desio Altruver y observar resultados (me está texteando más y mucho más mensajitos). Me siento más asustadamente contento que nunca :)
Sea hawks & dolphins have the best uniforms
Joe Buck should mayyyyybeee be announcing Pop Warner games. Zero analysis or apparent knowledge of the game. Joe is, however, stellar at elongating words until he can figure out what just happened. “Aaaaaaaaaaannnnnddd CAUGHT byyyyyyy...” And Joe, there is a difference between open and wiiiiiiide open. What a little girl.
In the first 30 seconds of the video link ( at the bottom), Dr. Mikovitz says that COVID19 is a lack of interferon alpha in the body. Okay, and all natural remedies for this are Chlorella or Chlorophyll; Reishi Mushroom powder or tincture/extract, Liposomal Vitamin C, Astralagus, CoEnzyme Q10, Gingko Biloba, Milk Thistle or Bonaset. Get ya'self 'bout 2 or 3 of each, and take a quarter teaspoon of each 2 to 3 times a week. Look it all up ya'self too. https://youtu.be/yqaakf-ISqk
They really put a false start in the highlights
Nice work dk💪🏾 Russ 👨‍🍳 lock 🔒
Kyler Murray looks like Pac-Man out there.
Kirkpatrick trying to fight DK is comedy. DK would knock his ass out and put him in ICU. Lol
Bozo cuomo should be fired. He is a disgrace.

A false start makes it to the highlight reel??
Hoping for a Pittsburgh-Seattle super bowl
10:40 blitz boy goated coverage
3:08 Way it’s edited, I was surprised to see Arizona suddenly have 7 points:  Would’ve helped if they showed ref clarifying a touchdown instead of implying Seattle got a fumble.
The Seahawks have never lost a game at Lumen Field
Bro really called it 😂 3:20
I'm just here for the Lockett to Ref fist bump...
12th man for life.
10:37 why didn’t he just go and tackle him.
seahawks got some home cookin
7:23 lol couldn't stop laughing!!!
Seriously the person who came up with the construction outfit for Seattle should get an award.
Lockett really fist bumped the ref at 4:11
You know you are stupid, when the Whitehead throws two flags in a row - 11:10 xD
Seattle defense improving. They probs watched Brett’s video on how their 4 man rushes were more effective than blitzes
Metcalf's footwork is amazing. He jukes the DBs off the line with regularity.
That last drive by Arizona they blew they chance by trying to take to many long shots down the field.
When normal wide receivers get hit, they go down. On the other hand, when dk Metcalf gets hit, the linebacker goes down
https://youtu.be/E6rwA19wA7E
Murray should've just kept going for first downs at the end. I think the cardinals should've won
I am a seahawk fan and if we lost we lost division def
#Cards undisciplined & too damn sLow.
Kyler murray suffered sprained AC joint in L.
@6:45 I like when Peterson reacts..."Why..what did I do"
I thought the Seahawks doesn't wear light green jerseys anymore
Ever since we got Carlos Dunlap this defense has been improving every week
Heavy traffic was reported at Lumen Field. Seahawks brought their safety vests so they don't get hit by a car.
No hate but how tf are some of these “highlights” cut the fat NFL.
Good to see the Cardinals getting the first 7 points for free
Joe "pass is caught" Buck
Cardinals do great. Most of the time
What a first game at Lumen Field! 💡⚡️
we got 3 easy games coming up so hopefully Seattle can come up clutch and win them all
Looks to me like the referees decided the ending
Hopkins is a great actor! He deserves an Oscar for this xD
As a fan of neither... I've gotta say, they let Seattle get away with alot. Had the refs done their job as well on both sides, Arizona would have won.
(6:18) (7:16) (9:11) Nice Truck 🏈 (8:30) Nice Move 🏈
Russ didn't turn it over, they had a run game, d stepped up. Seattle needed that bad.
The editors are really starting to slack on these. Crucial play highlights getting skipped all the time it seems of late.
Damn I miss seeing Lynch running around up there.
Darn it! Two teams I got to like and one of them has to lose. Too bad! Great game though.
3:10 did not see the game in tv. why is it ruled a td? because of the kneel down by seahawks Def. of did the ball already crossed the line by arizona? thx and greets from germany
That Cardinals running game will get them into the playoffs.
My man Pat Pete was having a rough game smh but he’s still the best corner in the game
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate Drake’s brilliant juke that caused a pretty nasty collision between the Seattle defenders? @7:19
Tough game for the officials in this game but dealt with everything really well all game👊🏽
It would’ve been fun to See Kyler at 100% with a O-Line. The flags made it impossible to win. The refs were awful for both teams. They dictated the game too much
X Factor for metcalf
My friend told me to listen to how many times the announcer kept saying “AND the pass is CAUGHT by __”. And omg I cannot stop hearing it now
プレーオフで戦う可能性も高いから、 お互いとっておきのプレーは出さず、 慎重に正攻法で戦ってた印象。緊張感があって良いゲームでした。
0:09
This was edited terribly. Also they were too lazy to add the backing track cheers. Too quiet, js.
God that green uni is the ugliest in NFL history. What a putrid green.
Carlos dunlap was such a big key componet to this defense. We needed a pass rush soooooooooooooooo bad.
Just get rid of the simulated crowd noise please.
Great game

The decline of Patrick Peterson has been so blatant makes you wonder did those PED’s really help him that much.
If Murray could have gotten kirk in the enszone there in the end I would have won the top prize of $1,000,000 on the draftkings showdown!!! Man I was pumped!!! Instead I won only $30!!! Lol
Are they really including penalties in the highlights??
Seattle very fortunate to get away with this game.
What a well play game by the cards tho! As u can Imagine I’m a jets fan they suck
Seattle pass interference on #37 in the end zone on pass to Larry Fitzgerald with 50 seconds left.
7-3 the Seahawks defense finally came through now they need to beat the Loser Rams.
Hey NFL: Why y'all have to monetize these highlight videos? Don't y'all make enough damn money already?? Sheeesh
There should've been a flag on the throw to Fitzgerald in the end zone near the end. I'm not a fan of either team but the refs threw a BS flag on the Cardinals near the end of the first half so if they could throw a flag on that play they could've easily thrown one against Seattle near the end.
Os caras botam um false start do te nos highlights, mas o TD do cardinals só percebi qnd o Seahawks fez o segundo 🤣🤣🤣
Do the Cardinals have the biggest helmets in the league? They are like bobble heads.  Soccer!
Being a hawks fan: heart attack every. single. game.
Seriously the person who came up with the construction outfit for Seattle should get an award.
How could someone have such little emotion (speaking of jow buck ofc)
They talked about tebow's throwing motion but murray has a bigger throwing motion. Tebow has a playoff win
3:20 😂😂 watch the screen
Still can't believe the Chiefs didn't draft Metcalf, but took another receiver. Ours is OK, but man...
BS holding call, dropped an open TD, and dropped another pass that coulda went far. DK really coulda and prolly shoulda had 100+ yards and 2 TD's 😭😭😭
Seattle Seahawks: Unveils TNF Color Rush Jerseys.   Rest of the World: WHAT ARE THOSE?!  Seriously, those are the f*cking UGLIEST uniforms I've seen in a long while...
Seattle: I still don't understand why Metcalf isn't getting 10+ targets per game, the way that Davante Adams and Julio Jones do.  With these guys, you've just got to find ways to get them the ball.  When Metcalf isn't involved, the team can barely move the ball.  Consider Metcalf's plays last night:  1) 25-yard scramble drill TD 2) 40-yard catch taken off the board  3) 46-yard DPI committed against DK that led to a TD  Granted, DK had a drop or two, but still he directly contributed to 14 points last night... he's got to be the weekly focus of this team.  Lockett is a nice player, but clearly defenses are willing to cede a half-dozen 8-yard Lockett catches.  Arizona:  8 targets for Nuk against the league's worst secondary?  And zero on the final drive?  And 10 targets for Larry Fitzgerald?   Ridiculous.  Also, some truly bad playcalling from Kingsbury.  Back-to-back deep shots to Andy Isabella & Fitzgerald on 2nd & 10 and 3rd &10 to end the game?  Isn't that why Hopkins is on the team?
Citi bank forecasting bitcoin to reach $318k by dec 2021
Action Green wins again!
Sooo why are they showing the plays that didn't count due to penalties 😂🤔. I mean there were a ton mind you. Great TNF gm. Turning pt was that safety. GG Russ & Seattle D!, 👍🏽
If i had a computer that could repeat "pass issss caught" "touchdown" "noflag" i could easily replicate joe buck's vast commentating repertoire...
Is it me or does Kyler throw off his back foot every play??
3:19 Someone from the Cards sideline yells watch the screen
Damn DK is a freak of nature he reminds me of Terrell Owens.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Y6AagqU9HnJUk-fiA0wXg
I'm glad they included DK in the offense, but that dropped pass in the end zone...it's like he didn't see the ball at all.  Maybe that visor is too dark. 🙄
Good to see Wilson not turning the ball over Hahaha
Editing was bad on this one. Key plays missing.
I like how they don't highlight the missed extra point from Seattle but they highlight the holding call against Arizona at 4:48.
@10:50 they doin the renegade
Hahah, cardinals lost.
The refs in this game were off 🤦. Some bad calls and no calls on both sides. I know nobody is perfect but these are refs 😐. Still a good game 🤝
Seahawks got revenge!!! 👍💪 Let’s Go!!!
Mannn would the Seahawks and Seahawk staff look greattt in a green field lmfaoo it may sound dumb but our turf is like idk looks old grayyy and yuk like if we would have natural grasss ufffffff we would look dopeeee asff like last years game one against Cincinnati our turf was brandddd newww and it loookeddd greenn and beautiful soo our hawks looked all swageeddd upp but then next home game it turned gray and since then its been gray idkkk whyy our turf is boring old gray why cant it be like houstons turff green and naturall grass looking ? Why
why were the cardinals in cages during introduction?
This is gettting hard to watch at this point
In my opinion that was a bad call at 6:35
Cincinnati Bengals: We have the worst O-Line Cardinals: Hold my flag
REVENGE
[2016 ab and Patrick [2020 D.K  and peterson
Dude said "watch the screen" And they still got burned on the screen lol
Pro tip: mute the sound to cancel out having to listen to "PASS IIIIIIIIISSSSSSS....." 👍
Week 11 of the 2020 NFL season was the 38th meeting since the 2002 NFL realignment and the 41st meeting (since the Cardinals went from Phoenix to Arizona in 1994) since 1995 between the Arizona Cardinals and the Seattle Seahawks.
Seahawks fans think they going to the Superbowl 🤣
Can someone let me know how many false starts are we at after last night !!! The Lu might be as dangerous as the Clink ... hahahaha
i thought the game was on sunday
.
When you don't enforce blatant holding and protect the QB with flags when someone does get there you create an environment where WR's can run for days and get open. Thus why the NFL is like watching a track meet instead of football.
I would have luvD to see this game when it orginally aired (NFC WEST RIVALS, WEAPONS ON ALL ENDS, HOPKINS VS METCALF COMPARISON, RUSS VS MURRAY COMPARISON AND COMPETIVE FROM START TO FINISH) but, had to work😶 definitely not the same with watching highlights
At the end there should have been a graph showing all fouls of every single play
3:20 "watch the screen" Didn't get the memo I guess
Horrible editing. Had to rewind repeatedly to figure out what the h311 happened.
Never heard of #30 Carlos Hyde, that hit was damn impressive before his touchdown.
Pete dont know how to gameplan at all. Hes always unbalanced when u need to run or pass more, or hes the complete opposite and we do play balanced and we lose bcuz of the predictable play calling. Pete needs to know when to turn it on bcuz it seems like the players are carrying this team and leading it. Pete has had nothing but bad draft picks and bad FA signings the past 3-5 years. Outside of DK and TY, the early round picks have either been a bust or injured. He literally traded up to get Taylor in the 2nd knowing damn well he just had a rod placed in his leg. U took the risk and it may or may not play out good for us, for right now it looks like a bad decision. Coulda drafted a WR or CB in the 1st 4 rounds but thats just me.
Ref to DK: ur ejected for fighting DK: Sorry, what? Ref: taunting, number 20 of the defense
Amazing game by both teams Kinda wish the penalties didn’t cost Arizona the game...  On more serious note, guys Jesus is coming back! We’ve all sinned and need God’s forgiveness! But Jesus already payed the ultimate sacrifice for our sins by dying on a cross and rising again! Now all we have to do is turn to God through Him and freely accept this gift of God’s grace! Study the Bible daily. Establish a relationship with God. Repent from your sins, be baptized for the forgiveness of those sins (Acts 2:38), and live a new life for Christ! There’s never a “good time” or a time where you’ll “be ready” to get right with God. What are you waiting for? Get right with God today!
please someone tell me why they played each other twice???
Was this highlight put together by a 5 year old? You have a take away in the end zone then it cuts to the middle of the field! Field goal not made not shown. Really don't think that a few extra minutes would be a problem. The majority of viewers are from other countries and don't have access to the NFL would be nice that they show the outcome of many of the contentious refereeing reckons as well.
Forgot DK Metcalfe was playing because RAMSey locked him up Sunday.
Nobody:  Joe Buck: Pass is........ caught
3:26 WATCH THE SCREEN! Hawks still get a first down on the screen.   **flex**
why does hopkins never tuck the ball?
These commentators were sucking Murray’s rod last night like it was their last day as broadcasters. Every play that was made by any cardinals player was Murray smh
Defense stepped up big time what ever they talked about in that meeting last week worked
Wow those refs worked hard to give that W to Seattle
So we sat and watched the refs call a false start and listened to the full description, but you can't show how Arizona's first touchdown was scored off a (correctly) reversed call?
7:22 dam these dudes gonna take out their own teammates lol
Should've just ran it for a 1st down. Stupid
Nice to see the RBs get some yards and add a dimension to the game.  D came up strong at the end too.  Funky way to get to 28, but we'll take it!  GO HAWKS
People really though Russ gonna lose this game he’s never lost 3 games in a raw in his entire career keep doubting
Leeeeets gooooo boooys🔵🔵⚪❤❤❤❤❤
Not gon lie fam.. that stack up release by DK on Pat P at 2:06... *Chefs Kiss*
Seahawks with Russell Wilson as QB now have a 9-1 Thursday Night Football record. Don't bet against them on TNF.
Only thing I got from these highlights is that DK is mad that they lost earlier to the cardinals
Chiefs are gonna win the super bowl this year
Kyler Murray will bounce back next week!!!
LFG!!!!!!!! WHOOOHOOHOOOHOOOO WHAT A GAME!!! SEA!!!!!!!.....HAWKS!!!!!
Why is Kliff Kingsbury a coach in NFL? They will just hand the job to any privileged bastard these days..
Murray went for the endzone too early
I pray Russell gets the credit he deserves this year in Jesus name
Pretty piss poor playing calling for Seattle in the second half.
The steelers will smash them easy 💪
Person who missed the first 3 quarters of a game: *crying sounds*  Person who missed the first 3 quarters of a Seahawks game: "it doesnt really matter. Its gonna be down to the last play anyways"
13-3
Hey, it's the Orlando Thunder!
ayo imagine in a couple of years Seattle got Justin Flowe
Penalties is what defeated Arizona
My rams will take care of business in the west.
No replay of Cardinals scoring toch down and conversion, also the Seahawks missing the conversion of their second TD...
Why did they cheat Cardinals so hard? All those Pass Interference on De hopkins and Larry Fitzgerald never got called. I am disgusted by watching this they didn't even call many penalties on the Hawks and they played just as rough as the Cards did.
Really unimpressed by both teams... too often the QB had no receiver!
And THOSE are supposed to be two MVP candidates and two of the best teams in the NFC.   What a joke on both accounts.
how did D hop get 50 yards with our4 string conerback????
Sick false start highlight
4:10 Whaaaaat!???
I hate the NFC West! I mean I love it because I am a Hawks fan but there are really no bad teams. Sometimes I wish we played in the AFC East or NFC East. Probably would have won more Superbowls.
pass is.. CAUGHT. can't stand joe buck
Kirkpatrick trying to fight DK is comedy. DK would knock his ass out and put him in ICU. Lol
Seahawks won!🥳
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!!🙏😊💝
Cardinals bench: *coughs* Refs: “15 yard penalty on Arizona, first down Seattle” Seattle: *false start* Refs: “Touchdown”
DK Vader Jr
The Seattle defense just went from horrible to incredible in one week
But Cardinals win this game if they clean up the penalties! The holding for a safety and 2 Big penalties with the PI by Peterson and personal foul by Kirkpatrick.. Kyler murray is playing like hes 6'5 not 5'11-ish 💪
i guess that it is too much to ask to ask for the refs to just be consistent in their calls.  at 12:43 not one seahawk anywhere around where wilson threw the ball. no intentional grounding call
Is it just me or did they leave out Diggs blowing up Arnold?
@ 4:11 lockett fist bumps👊 the ref after his TD lol the ref was like I SEE YA LIL TOE TAP TONY 😂😂
E
Me trying to watch football add: USAA five minutes later USAA five minutes later USAA
Seattle cooking
i
https://youtu.be/oRA9cuF19No
You got the false start but not the touchdown by the cardinals???
Umm you missed some vital information? We didn’t even see how the Cardinals got the first touchdown. It looked like a fumble in the end zone.
the PI call on Ap before half was BULLSHIT
4:12 Lockett's fist bump with the ref after his touchdown. 😊
I would love to see Dolphins vs Cards, two young QBs that have something to prove.
Cool
Must be nice to be able to beat the cardinals
The way these highlights are clipped is really annoyi
WAY TO GO SEAHAWKS
Just gonna say it, Dj Metcalf is great but I don't think he will be the superstar receiver we want him to be.
Wtf is the video editor doing... 7-0 Seahawks and the video shows the cards fumbling into the endzone then it cuts to 7-7.... smh
now every analyst will jump back on the seahawks' bandwagon and say they're superbowl favorites. the real problem i have is some of these analysts wont make up their mind. like if you they are sb favorites, then stick with it, and don't jump on to another team.
You guys gotta start showing some replays in this edit man

Reading these comments just proves that the majority of Seahawks fans are the worst kind of fans you can have. Nothing but derogatory and put down statements. No class whatsoever. But it’s understandable. I’d be salty too, having a lead for an entire game and losing it in OT.
Arizona has a bad coach challenged when it was clear not reversible called the wrong plays
The talk that maybe Kliff isn't as great of an offensive schemer as some people hoped certainly gained some traction in this game; any time you target Larry at this stage of his career more than maybe the best WR in the league and the latter only ends up getting 5 for 51 yards in a game you were trailing the entire way, you've already given the other team a huge advantage.  Plus it's not like the Seahawks have a Jalen Ramsey level top CB to put on Hopkins; in fact the Seahawks placed two CBs on IR this week and Griffin missed the game and they signed a CB off their practice roster so that was a pretty terrible job by Kyler/Kliff under using Hopkins and it cost them the game.
Can you imagine your own team gives a two safety point for free to your opponent?
How do they not edit a whole ass touchdown my goodness
No Hail Murray was to be had this time.
Murray and Wilson suck...these quarterbacks will never be MVP of the league.  Hope they dont make it to SB cause KC will blow them out!
8:37
My favorite part of the game 14:14
Cardinals be like we may not win this one but we sure as hell going to hurt as many Seahawks we can by the end of the game.. lol 😂 all jokes aside those referees did us (AZ) dirty.
How are Cardinals going to try deep passes at the end of the game with an injured QB? 😐
We need to stop doing the HB Toss plays cuz our RBs aren't made for that kind of stuff
This is the 4th straight game where Kliff has shown he doesn’t know how to call plays in the 4th Quarter
It's still hard for the quarterbacks to see over the line and the middle of the route tree. But they have elite accuracy and game smarts.
i don't want to complain too much about free HD highlights of every gamel, but the editing on these has really gone downhill this season
I think that refs helped the Seattle on the end. Arizona had a chance, this was a very close game. GJ Cardinals
Peterson isn’t the guy for the cardinals defense anymore imo
The Seahawks is going to the playoff
This game showed us that both Cardinals and Seahawks have horrible O Lines
When is a win a loss?  When you gave the seattle defense. Thr offense can never breathe a sigh of relief with them on the field. They keep thi opposition in the game. Why do they lay off of EVERY receiver EVERY game like that.  Russ has to do way too much to keep them in the game.  I can not see them challenging for a Super Bowl with how porous and weak a defense as they have right now.
I randomly stooped at :56
Talk about the refs handing the game to Seattle. The NFL has always had terrible biased refs that throw away games
Wow that last play! They rush 3 and get the sack? Cardinals o line wow....
As a Seahawks fan I want to see a touchdown by Fitzgerald he just a cool guy
So...I guess Sea. scored at 3:00 and it wasn't a turnover? Nice job NFL Highlights....🍻🍻🍻🍻🤷
@9:36 Wtf Kyler out here playing madden.
Larry old af lol I respect him still being out there but homie running a 5 flat on his 40
This guy wilson is different, he is carrying the offence and defence.
nice
dre kirkpatrick lost them the game with that stupid Penalty even tho it was in the 3rd quarter that was a turning point
Seriously, who edits these videos? You don't think it would be a good idea to show us that it was indeed a touchdown and not a fumble down at the 1-yard line? I see this every week with these "Highlight" videos. Important information is just glossed over and spectacular plays have no replays for the audience to take in. Instead we got a replay of Metcalf running a route on a play that was called back due to penalty. Very disappointing...
That was a boss catch by Arnold
I love how at 2:57 the highlights make it look like Arizona turned the ball over at the goal line and the next play is the Seahawks with the ball after what looks like a touchback and if you don't look down at the score, you wouldn't know it's tied all of the sudden. Great job on the editing, NFL.
4:09 That ref had lockett on his fantasy team.  I've never seen one fist bump a player after a Touchdown.
10:36, #43 didnt even try sacking Murray
Dumb penalties and irresponsible antics made us lose this game. Why go 2-3 times to the endzone with less than 30 seconds on the clock? They thought they were lucky with the dhop play last week smh. We should be 7-3 rn, but overall nice game
Could not help but notice the thousands of screaming ghost as the stadium was empty .
You know what that's pretty pathetic when you see a one-sided game like guess where Cardinals couldn't get a break everything they did was a penalty on them in Seattle still barely won the game with the refs in their pocket how fat is that
My takeaway from this game is Carlos Hyde came out and showed why he should be a starter
They should use DJ Dallas more
Awwwww so sad.  No more miracles this week.
Seahawks barely won this.
seahawks need a black color rush
They really should've retired 31 25 and 29 but then again the Seahawks don't know how retiring numbers work. Only team I know of to retire a number and I'm retire it just so a great player past his prime could wear it.
Pass is....... CAUGHT
The refs were sus asf
Did anyone else see locket fist pump the referees 4:18
Wow Seahawks defense was actually good
Hi
I was a DB was 6 years. That play Peterson made on Metcalf was NOT a pass interference. And this is coming from a person who doesnt like either team. Completely bs call that gave the Seahawks an easy TD.
Flight dk is.a nobody 🦈🦈🦈
Let’s be honest  The referees beat the cardinals
Me when the game started: Alright is Metcalf or Lockett gonna have a big night *Russ throws a touchdown to both of them* Me:😲
Peterson has truly "Lost a Step".....He needs a Safety to help with DK Metcalf......
Well done HAWKS!
Why Greg Olsen why!? We miss you at Carolina
I watched the full game last night I just loved it so much I’m watching highlights
Wow they fid that with 49ers  last yesr
When the Seahawks have a healthy running back in the game, they are good
Instead of hail Murray, for the seahawks its we just nailed Murray.
Bro these referees ruin the game 46 yard penalty wtf
Ez
GO Hawks
Seahawks gotta stop giving me heart attacks. I have a feeling we'll do good in playoffs this season tho
The refs were blind this game against the cardinals prove me wrong. They wanted Seattle to win
Murray looked like sht this game and Cardinals as a team; way to many penalties.
Cardinals choked so hard
There were a LOT of missed penalties this game....this coming from a Seahawks fan. GG tho
The ref gave Lockett a fist bump when he scored lol
Ref: sees Cardinals O-line pushing the Seattle D-line away  Ref: Holding, Offense, result: safety  Everyone else: 🤔
tre locked up hopkins
14:42 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Seattle still gets it down to the wire every time. Idk if they could do really good in the playoffs.
At 6:45 he’s acting like he didn’t hold him 😂
could you imagine if the 12s were there? after two straight losses, they get to see carlos dunlap blow past the cardinals right tackle and slam kyler murray to the ground to win the ball game, chop the knees (or shoulder rather) of one of the mvp candidates, derail the russell wilson hate train, and send seattle to 7-3, and back to the top of the best division in football. they would go berserk
ill take a heart pounding game over terrible preformances
“WATCH THE SCREEN”  *Lets them get a first off a screen*
I hope Olsen is ok I meet him before at a Steelers panthers game a while back
ISN'T  " D.K. " A CHARACTER FROM N64 MARIO PARTY  ? 🤗
I watched the game they need to fire the announcers locket will make a catch and they keep talking about DK
Im loving how they include the highlights that were negated by penalty.
I feel bad for anyone who has to cover metcalf
Go hawks💚💙
Where was the flags for Fitz and Isabella at the end 🤦‍♂️Seahawks playin 12 man football
Pat Pete got his ass whooped on the whole game 🤦🏾‍♂️ cmon dawg
5 GAMES WON IN HOME STREAK
Metcalf had more action in the first possession than he did against the Rams for 4 quarters
The only thing worse than watching the cardinals shoot themselves in the foot all game, is having to listen to Joe Buck and Troy Aikman
Cardinals didint do good
3:25 they said watch the screen and nobody watch the screen haha
Finally we won the game lol #GoHawks
I thought they were going to have another overtime battle because the cardinals had to score one more time
Thank god Seattle didn’t lose 4 in a row
3:20 the cardinals litterly yelled "WATCH THE SCREEEEEEEEN" and then continued to let the Seahawks to get a 1st down from a screen pass😂😂😂
Murray almost have that game winning drive
Fits should have got the PI at the end
As a Niner fan the NFC West is BRUTAL.
bruh they almost did it again...
It’s was Seahawks reff vs cardinals
Bro why has flowers been playing some lock up  defense tho
Arizona lost the game because Dre Kirkpatrick on defense decided to not be a team player and let his temper take control at 9:05.   Not being a team player cost them the game as it would have been 4th down and Seattle would have punted.  Instead the ball was moved forward 15 yards and then they ran it in for a touchdown.   It was not Metcalf that was flagged as alluded to in this video.  It was actually the play that decided the game and this highlight did not show the whole thing.    Actually the Cardinals had way too many penalties.   A game they should have won because of it.
Murray missed two TD opportunities on that drive, the first being nuke getting on top of his defender when he threw it to Fitz on the dig instead, the other being the corner on the second to last play, just didn't have the arm strength and underthrew it. Crucial opportunities wasted
Metcalf givin me diva vibes  Plus a dropped td
Now I see all these empty seats, which are sold out most of time, I came to realize  there are an awful lots of people out there at home !!
Man right when Cardinals doing well we choke again...
They lost the game no 😞
Pat Peterson been getting picked on lately.
You know it's a Seahawks game when it always comes down to the last play. Props to Murray and the Cardinals though, they struggled but fought hard.
Refs didn’t call nothing for cardinals
13:56 #37 gets there too soon it probably should have been a flag
These highlights suck. They have you guessing what happened multiple times.
Cardinals were going to win this game if they didn’t get all those flags if Ima be honest
Cardinals lost no 😫
I'm so upset that the cardinals lost!!
damn I thought seattle will lose but thenk god they won
Would you rather have Dre Kirkpatrick or J R Sweezy for lolcow of the week?
I've never seen a ref fist bump a receiver after a touchdown catch.
Like the 20 uncalled pass inference that was by seattle
Dre Kirkpatrick: *Tries to smack talk and punch D.K. Metcalf*  D.K. *Monster grab*
Hire some better refs
If they made that touchdown with dk they would’ve had 20 and if they made all the ose touchdown they would have 28 instead of all the feel goals
Refs really love seattle
The Seahawks have never lost a game at Lumen Field.
We needed this...we earned this one...and I am loving those jerseys, need them as a hoodie!
I swear how was that td pass to fitz not called PI???
So we just gonna ignore how Tyler locket just causally gives the ref a fist bump after that TD😂
That was an awesome game and well played by the cardinals too.
i hate they show 4 yard runs yet seldom do they show sacks
Murray looks like a little T. rex with short arms ... but damn is fast 💨
Worst highlights ever
NFC West: 3 very good teams all neck and neck with each other & the 49'ers. NFC East: 4 awful teams all tripping over each other
At the end there should have been a graph showing all fouls of every single play
3:16 into video at no time does the highlight clip explain what happened when they so-called fumble in the end zone. Next thing you know the score is 7/7
I never knew sea hawks were green      The actual animal
I already imagine Flight reacting to this "Russell Wilson is so overrated"
One relatively obscure destination outside the francosphere that I personally find super fascinating would be the oddly “parentheses/ claw” shaped  Îles de Los islands off the coast of #Conakry #Guinea. As the inspiration for the book “Treasure island” Each island had a historically specific function (Tamara- prison, Kassa- factories, Roume- fishing) and today They are probably the most renown resorts with pristine beaches that are popular amongst tourists. Ferries operate from the Conakry peninsula regularly.  #Africa #maps #cool #travel
U S A A
Like for Week 7 Reply for Week 11
That is a bullshit flag.
On the down side this was a pretty bad game by budda Baker I hope he bounces back because prior to this week I think he's honestly the best safety in the game and I can say the same for dk metcalf who also had a medicore day
Murray is garbage.  How do you get sacked in the end zone 😂
Russ didn't turn it over, they had a run game, d stepped up. Seattle needed that bad.
Turdinals were probably thinking about that miracle they pulled Sunday against Buffalo
So embarrassing to watch the cardinals play
WATCH THE SCREEEN!!
Cardinals could have tied at the end of Murray stopped looking for the deep ball
WHO IS THE REF AT 4:10 TO LOCKETT???
Dk is such a diva lol
Just wanna say that Jason Myers is still perfect. Give Jason Myers a like!
2:13 that would of been a good ass play if it wasnt for the penalty peterson dk son
NFC is wiiiiiide open. Every top team has looked both real good and real bad. Plus home field is not gonna mean the same without full stadiums.
Lmaoo watch the screen .5 seconds screen 😂😂
You guys really need to get a better editor. They literally skipped over the review for Arizona's first score.
murray has much more potential with a better o line
Crazy that everyone thought the cardinals were gonna pull off a sweep
Seattle’s O-Line needs to step up
Cardinals made way too many dumb mistakes
Go seahawks yessir we won 7 and 3💚💙💚💙💚💙💙💙💙💙💚💙💚💙💚💙💚💚💚💙💙💚💙💚💚💚💚
We did good just need to give Wilson some time Ggs
Dk is a beast man
7:04 dude forgot to turn off his mic
Fans: Refs arent biased at all..  Refs: hold my beer
That was a fun game to watch
And to think Texans lost Hopkins and Hyde in the same year🤷🏽‍♂️
Congrats on the Hawks on winning the rematch. Also, what a first game at the new field! Both teams have about the same final 6 games in their schedule; not so much in terms of which teams the Cards and the Hawks play but the strength of both teams' schedules. The NFC West will come down to who slips first.
ill take a heart pounding game over terrible preformances
James 1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
The calls definingly favored Seattle couple of uncalled ones for Cardinals, but what can ya do
i’m just mad at dre and pat pete
Just watching the highlights you could see that Cheatattle got all the calls, per usual.
Leaves in the comment about DK throwing a punch, but doesn't show when they later found out he didn't. Nice
Does anybody want to explain to me how 6:42 was a Pass Interference on Pat Pete but the last 2 passes by Kyler Murray weren't? Pat Pete barely touched DK and played the ball with his eyes, the pass to Isabella, Isabella was hit and had his arm held before the ball arrived and the defenders didn't even turn to look at the ball. Or does anyone want to explain how a holding call that was outside of the end zone got called a safety and they said he held inside the end zone when it was clear he wasn't? Seahawks fans shouldn't feel good about this win when they needed the refs help.
How does it feel to be 6 and 4 lol
Man dat boy D.K. a beast
Previous Texans players playing well with their respective new teams. Burn Houston sports!
seahawks get away with so much cheating!
DK is a great receiver. He cuts down on those easy drops he could be top 5 in the league
What are dbs supposed to do on that DK deepshot? Pat P played that perfectly and still got called for a flag
Can we please talk about how much kyler ignores his best receiver?
Kinda tired of seeing how "great" Seattle's defense was. We just gonna ignore how wide open receivers were??
easy game easy life
Is it me or is every receiver having a good highlight on pat Pete
Dude said "watch the screen" And they still got burned on the screen lol
Can Baker Mayfield do this.. as browns fan I feel bad for my team..
Peterson is no longer a shut down corner why are they putting him in situations he can’t handle
Gotta say f u refs... Yet again..... But great job Seattle... Clean game.. We didn't get a turnover this time... Still go Cardinals 24/7.....
Cardinals could have won it if Dre Kirkpatrick did not start the fight with DK metcalf
Whoever edited this deserves a demotion
I'm confused.  The cardinals had a great drive at the end of the game, but as soon as they got past the 30 they just started slinging it even though they still had a timeout and almost 50 seconds.  Bad coaching lost the game man
Tre flowers dhops daddy
seahawks$$$
6:35 This absolute HEAVE by Russ 👀
yay we won woohoo
Great editing, so Drake's fumble was a TD not a turnover, can we make sure the viewer actually knows this not just cut to the next snap. Honestly, so amateurish.
Did anyone else notice at around 4:07 after the Lockett Td it appears when he pass the referee they fist 🤛 bumped each other w t f ?
The likes that my comment has are the flags that Cardinals had in the game.
We're not going to talk about how the ref daps up Lockett after his TD? 4:10
Wilson put a lil extra fat on for the winter didn't he!?
THE CARDS shouldve won
3:17, "WATCH THE SCREEEEEEN!!!" 😂😂😂😂
I can't wait to see more from Seattle and Arizona. This rivalry is gonna be great for years to come. Good game to Arizona. I don't think this is gonna be the last time we meet. So see y'all in the Postseason 👏
NFL Highlight editing: *ball is out - turnover by Cardinals* Next play by Seattle somehow a TD was scored... lol
Wait did Metcalf get ejected because I didn't see him after that fight?
With two timeouts that last drive was little bit on Kyler for not playing for the first down. He should have been looking towards getting a little closer before taking endzone shots.
Worst game officiated this season so far
10:54 watch the DB come off the edge just to chase Hyde right back up the middle lmao
Me: "Seahawks, why do you always have games that come down to the wire?" Seahawks: "This is the way."
I’m looking at these sacks and scrambles and just thinking of how that would be a fumble on madden
I haven't seen Blitz Boi made real plays
Tbh if tha cardinals rebuild they o line its ova with I swear
Me: "Seahawks, why do you always have games that come down to the wire?" Seahawks: "This is the way."
I'm not even a cardinals fan I'm a lions fan but those refs were so bias for the cardinals
how did arizona get the first touchdown? it doesnt show in the video
Lumen field tho?
Am I the only one annoyed by the fake crowd noise? It is ok at the beginning, but it even more annoying when you look in the stand, you see no one,  but the fake crowd noise is so loud you cannot hear the announcers.   How about when they bleep the players?....lol
This is now the NTFL - National Touch Football League.
DK is the next Gronk(in his prime): too big and strong to cover without molesting him.
Joe Buck makes my ears bleed.
“Kyler MVP” 😂😂😂😂
As A bills fan gotta love it
3:20 listen to the arizona defense scream watch the screen and then get beat for a first by a screen.
a question: I have recently followed the NFL, I am Italian. More or less I know the rules but one thing escapes me. How did the 2 points make them? that is they were 21 to 23 and then 21 to 25. thanks
Damn you Chase Edmonds😅
1:18 hard count got the whole d-line + his own tight end lol
lets go hawks
En México hay un refrán, el que a hierro mata a hierro muere, y a los cardenales les ocurrió lo mismo, pero ahora ellos fueron los Bills de búfalo de la semana pasada
BIRD BATTLE
I don't care what anybody says, that throwaway pass near the end by Murray was one of the most low effort throwaways I've ever seen. It cost them the game.
Whoever cut this did a terrible job you didn't show the call for Arizona's first TD and you didn't show Seattle's first FG
The Thursday night play by play guy puts me to sleep. Hes so mono tone.
10:51 Drake and Edmunds Were doing the out west tik tok. lol Ask Addison Rae, Dixie and Charli to help with tik toks.
Luke 6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:
Seahawks game *exists*  Football gods- "So you have chosen heart failure for your fans."
These refs must have drafted a lot of Seattle Seahawks for their fantasy team or something, plenty of missed calls.
Ref three the game for Us. This crew is mad young except the white head whole first quarter no penalty??
Russ said, "it's still my division kid...hang on a little bit longer."
DK brought me here.
Something is wrong with the NFL mic
i   don have uses spaces f
the do yourjobatrusselwilsonnohavepresioninyourheadantheseatleseahwakswin let goseattle
Patrick Peterson cant guard dk
I hope The Bills (my favorite team) are watching the last Cardinals drive and taking notes on how to stop 3 Hell Mary's for next time ; )
Good game Seattle. This one was tough to swallow, I could play the “but Murray had an injured shoulder” card but your defense actually showed up in this game. Hats off to you guys.   And tell Diggs to stop headhunting that’s like the 5th time this year he’s been called for a hit on a defenseless player
4:10 did Lockett just fist-bump the ref for making the touchdown?  Lol!
1:47 look at the bottom of the screen and tell me d.k. did not just sauce up pat pete. that was dirty!
The 600 dislikes are salty cardinal fans
after this, im 100% sure metcalf is on roids, its like every game now he has a fight or argument w the db thts guarding him, think hes done one too many injections cuz his emotions get the best of him, OFTEN
We definitely needed this win BAD!! I hope Greg, Brandon Shell, Bo are alright tho. Go Hawks!
Much-needed win. Go Hawks.
I love Seahawks but they won’t win unless russ plays out his mind or this defense gets better because they can’t stop anyone 😭
Go Seahawks even tho I’m a Texans fan, tis could be Wilson’s last chance to get another ring and an mvp
what a way to finish it.... sack!
What misleading highlights. I can see a series of misleading clips like the fumble that was overturned, them saying Metcalf threw a punch when it was Kirkpatrick, etc. I expect more from the NFL's editing department.
We look much better On to Philadelphia....Go SEA
Imagine how many false starts the cardinals would get if there was a crowd :/
Lemme know why the highlights don’t show the cardinals first touchdown
Go Russell Wilson we won
The Seahawks didn't win this game the Cardinals lost it for themselves. SMH
Less of Russell Wilson is a win for the Seahawks. Still outplayed by Kyler
Cards O-line looks baaaaddddd
First game in a long while that Seattle had multiple 3-and-outs on defense. That's promising! Especially since they have an easier schedule ahead of them against the NFC East, the Jets, and then two division games to end the regular season. If they can handle their business and get players back from injury, they'll be cruising.   Looks like Chris Carson is scheduled to come back, and Rashaad Penny could be back on the field before Christmas. Shaquill Griffin cleared concussion protocol as well, so hopefully his hamstring injury doesn't worsen.   Good job Lewis for stepping in at center and handling the pressure well. Bad news about Greg Olsen though - he was a great asset for that offensive line on blocks, but maybe this will give Dissly a chance to step up his game.     Another nailbiter finish, but the difference-maker was Carlos Dunlap with the sack to end the game. So glad Seattle brought him on! They've just got to keep communicating better - they had some obvious blown coverage, and they weren't calling out receivers as they were being passed from one zone to the next. Things they certainly need to clean up before the end of the year.
I love how this is turning into soccer. OMG he hit me...please flag, flag, flag, omg omg
The battle of the birds
Did anyone notice he said Dallas at 6:23 instead of Seattle
@7:28 this was terrible call... It was a bad throw and absolutely NO helmet 2 helmet contact... They threw the flag cause Hopkins begged for it
What the heck are these highlights?! No replay of important plays like the turn over on the goal line, not seeing multiple sacks, and missing the first Arizona TD?
I wish Seattle was good
Epitome of Seattle's playcalling at 3:20. Guy yells out "watch the screen" and then it shockingly turns out to be a screen. The only people who think Carroll and Schottenheimer are clever is them.
Darn it man, I predicted Cards would win 31-28 on my website. They making me look like fools for the whole world wide web to see LOL :)
Remember when the Cardinals passed on DK Metcalf in favor of Andy Isabella..?
Wasn't that a PI penalty at the end??!!
Russ went back to his efficient move the ball no mistakes roots
9:22 should of done that in the Super Bowl
i am a Bills fan, and I'm proud of the seahawks.
As a cards fan I knew it would be tough. Seattle is not a team to sleep on and whenever people hype up the Cards they do poorly and when people don't give them a chance they win. Cards did not deserve to win that game and Seattle did. Seattle looked great!
I always believed in russ, all these bandwagons saying he NOW deserves an mvp award,but y’all weren’t saying that couple weeks ago, smh.
Good and crucial win by the Seahawks, this NFC West division is a strong one for sure this season
Cardinals: Watch that screen!!!  Cardinals: Then gives up a screen.
SEAHAWKS✌🏽😎
Refs said here Seahawks u want the game
The person who does these highlight videos needs replaced. Shows us a a 5 yard penalty on 3rd & 7 in the first quarter that led to nothing, but didn’t show replay for Cardinals first td or the missed PAT on hawks second TD. Seriously? It’s so inept.
Seattle is such a toxic team. All the refs this game were on their side the whole time. Metcalf through some punches with no ejection. What?! I’m not a cardinals fan but they deserve this win.
Dunlap was a STEAL
safety do win games and most importantly the big games.... great play SEATTLE
I'm not a fan of either team, but I watched the game. So... are the NFL refs on some sort of quota for penalties? What an absolute joke NFL officiating is. But no surprise... it's been bad FOREVER!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No doubt that at the end Kyler Murray was still throwing dots and receivers had good positioning when they game down
Dude the Seahawks uniforms.... it’s just so bad
Go hawks
we got revenge on the Cardinals
Watch Russell pocket present he's smart as hell
finally are defense is better
Did Lockett dap the umpire on his touchdown
DK kinda turning into a diva/problem.....
Why it seem like the Seahawks never run the ball at the goal line haven’t they learned
the nfl highlights are too long
Anyone catch Lockett fist bumping the ref after his td 😹
Ref: you costed your team a major penalty and you will be ejected l.  DK: I’m sorry repeat it again?  Ref: Taunting, number 20
go hawks
That hit on d hop was not a helmet hit
The fact that arizona looked like trash the whole night and still only lost by 7. Imagine if they were on their a game...
TRACE MCSORELY
Cardinals: Thinking they are going to win when driving down the field. The refs: No your not
DK is a beast!!!!!
3 guarantees in life  1. Bills  2. Taxes 3. The Seahawks going 1-1 against the cardinals
How many more penalties will you cause?  O-line for both teams: Yes
Pass isssssssssssssssss
I love how Seahawks barely made running play, meanwhile at Baltimore....
Finally Lockett actually drops a decent amount of fantasy points
Cards defense needs some serious chalk talk. This game was a microcosm of what you’ll face as it gets into better teams. Can’t always rely on a miracle Hail Murray.  O line, you hold your gonna get ten yards, the wrong way! That runner just risked his neck for those ten yards. Learn to block properly.  Practice and get better that’s the ticket.
Goood game! Football👏👌😎
You missed showing us how Arizona scored their first touchdown! You also missed showing us if Seattle missed the FG on their second touchdown. C'mon.
At 3:20 he literally said watch the screen lol an they still didn’t stop the play lol
What's with the play calling of the Cardinals? First Down, 20yards and they play a screen to Fitzgerald...
Seahawks uniform sucks idk why people like it 🤢
Need to appreciate Tre Flowers. Had an amazing game vs Hopkins.
Yeah sorry but if both teams plsy like that against the rams, we are going to take the dub
I'm really happy for the Seahawks I'm upset for the cardinals but they win the first time so
This game should have clearly went to overtime cause that was pass interference on Fitz on that 2nd and 10 pass at the end and almost could have called it on 3rd down but the one on Fitzgerald was def P.I
Me trying to watch football add: USAA five minutes later USAA five minutes later USAA
2 teams that are good, but will never make the SB
12:40 why is that not intentional grounding
Gg Carlos Dunlap... go get you one fam!!!!
Seattle got lucky they still overrated tho like they lost to the rams and to the cardinals the last game
seattle d line was keeping that pressure!
Gotta say this is one of my favorite highlights video.  Not for the game itself, which was enjoyable.  But you actually left the penalty announcements in.  Thanks for doing that.
@nfl I wish the thumbnail didn’t always give the game away...😤
I guess you can say Kyler Murray came up a bit....short
Seriously the person who came up with the construction outfit for Seattle should get an award.
7:22 tried to send him flying but instead they send them flying
How they not gonna call the PI on the Fitz plus? Say I’m wrong but the nfl want to redeem the Seahawks so bad without beast mode  mar Shawn I guess thru refs is the way.
Kyler Murray for MVP!!!!
Who should the Seahawks be rooting for rams or bucs if rams win they remain number one in the division but if the bucs lose its very possible the Seahawks can get that first round bye
Battle of the midgets
The TD DK dropped cost me 15 fantasy points, I better not lose by 15
Some shitty editing
Dang there was PI at the end, this game should've gone to OT.
am i the only one that thinks of anquan boldin when i see dk metcalf in action
Joe buck must’ve seen pat mcafee’s video on crappy announcers cuz it seemed like he was trying some new things this game 🤣🤣
Damn I wanted the cards to win
This was a big win
Bro at 4:10 lockette fist bumps the ref
Lol we need to work on these highlights. In the first 3 mins there is an entire false start penalty played out in a highlight. A big play for 30+ yards that had an offensive penalty so called back. And no confirmation on the first cards touchdown loool. Come on.
Seahawks are still the best team in the NFC they just had all their running backs injured, if Russ has absolutely no second option to run then he’s obviously going to turn the ball over more
DK scored a touchdown and went straight to the sidelines 🤣🤣
seattle kinda played dirty tonight an got lucky
3:19 watch the screen! Or not lol
This now prove that the cards win over the bills was just a lucky one😂😂
Arizona really mismanaged the end of this game. Intentional grounding and a safety was bad. Challenging that play and losing a timeout as well as calling a timeout when they actually got the play off. Even if they hadn't, losing 5 yards is less valuable then losing a timeout at that point. You were trying to get in the end zone not kick a field goal!
Chase Edmonds went to my girlfriend school. She sat at his lunch table in middle school.  She said his mom would always tell him he could do whatever he wanted with his life except get a girl pregnant. Lol
The Bills beat Seattle. The Cardinals beat the Bills. Seattle beat the Cardinals.   They’ve gone full circle.
0:59 that’s the worst spin move on a pass rush attempt all season lmao
Why did they change the field name?
DK Metcalf is a BEAST
Whoever edited this video should’ve clarified the first AR touchdown, cause it seemed like a recovered fumble by Seattle and a rejected to run.
Oh how sad Arizona talking all that trash to us bills fans how we suck and look 👀
Looks like that Beastmode spirit is still in those Seattle running backs.
Why in the world do you have 48 secs left on the clock a fresh set of downs and you’re getting 6yds a carry would you stop running... my lord, you had the momentum
Let’s go hawks we needed that
it literally looks like i change the playback speed to  1.75x when Kyler runs
These highlights continue to dip in quality; time to start bench!
I woke up today thinking it was Saturday and I was happy about not having to go to school but then realized it was Friday. This has been a very disappointing morning...
how many times does that tv announcer says the word caught
Patrick Peterson is garbage when he’s off the PED’s 🤣🤣🤣
IK
Bruh is dk's mouthguard a baby pacifier
So like Seattle's defence is bipolar af.
Pass issss caught! Imagine getting paid to say that 1000 times a game
What a shame by the Cardinals o line can't even hold 3 guys, seahawks still playing really sloppy
Seeing an empty stadium really remind me of how much 2020 sucks..:'(
Joe Buck ruining another game with his monotonous drone
4:10 proof that they cheated
I like how an offensive false start makes the highlights
who edits this "highlight" package?where's the cardinals touchdown,what happened to the seahawks extra point?dude maybe you got bored but I'm watching this for the first time please include scores and misses
The referees give Seahawks
Not the 3 man rush instant shed for the gameeeeeee 😩😩😩
This was an amazing game actually, i think the cardinals played way too emotional tho, Seattle definitely got in their heads.
As a Bills fan this makes me smile after what happened Sunday.
AZ needs an offensive coordinator calling plays, and plays that include more than the occasional run.  I truly believe if we had come out and obtained a few first downs running, the game would have turned out differently.
Cardinals luck out against the Bills...now lose to Seattle...over hype!!
Lockett fist bumps ref after TD 😂
Peterson has been getting killed lately
How does Cardianls get that 7 points? Is it because that guy from Seahawks put the ball back it his own goal line?
I hope we get to see dis matchup one more time in a playoffs dis year
“Pass is caught..”
Bad call on Diggs. This is football not softball
The cardinal fans got real quiet after this game
Seattle why do you continue to use these absolutely ugly uniforms?!
where's all the dk haters now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 saying patrick is gonna lock him yeaight.
These are the best color rush jerseys in the league
Damn
I’d never thought I’d say this, but the d carried
Such a messy game filled with penalty's
Lost money , I only needed one more td pass from Kyle
One of the most boring Thursday night games in a long time ...🥱😴
colts or texans should try n get edmonds from arizona
Lets be real that was P.I. on fitz at the end Seahawks fans yall got handed a dub be happy
These Seahawks/Cardinals games are gonna be good for a long time
Those lucky penalties though
Russ is the best QB in the league.
I see all of these people who hate the unis the seahawks are wearing, but they're fire
Bet one million
Who else is getting ads before the video
Given how bad the Seahawks D has been this year and that Kingsbury is supposed to be on Offensive Guru, this is a really poor result for the Cardinals
That’s how you play the defense. Love my Seahawks 😍😍😍😍😘😘
Cardinals Oline didn't show up. Murray was making passes even while getting hit. He's going to be something special
I already watched the full game but I’m watching the highlights too lol
These highlights like made by a 13 years old kid. The nfl make a joke by themselve
Russ mvp
Why do I keep seeing these piddling ref calls on a highlight reel? Is a false start a highlight, or do the refs need to be shown for contractual reasons?
Y'all actually thought Russ would lose on this smh
Lockett dapped up the ref 👀
Wow this Seahawks defense is actually getting better!   Still cant believe D Hop mossed all the Bills yet didnt do too much against thr Seahawks defense
Seahawks have a new stadium? Since when?
Now if the defense can just maintain this performance, then maybe we can make a deep playoff run. Dont need the defense to be elite, they just gotta be decent.
why wasn’t the 1st play of the game (a sack) in the highlights?
These comments are lit af
Ultimamente tem sido afligente assistir aos jogos do Seahawks, eu nem fiz questão de assistir ao jogo ao vivo, ainda mais sabendo que ia jogar contra os Cardinals.
Peterson getting old
The rushing game for Seattle really lifted all the weight off Wilson’s shoulder
Seattle got away with alot of penalties. How many times were they flagged?
I think cardinals used up all their luck for the season vs Buffalo lol
You gotta wonder why there is recorded crowd noise? I would love to hear a game without it? Which crowd noise is for the home team. Its funny how the noise elevates when both teams do something positive.
Apart from playing a few soft coverages Tre Flowers played well man gotta give him that!
7:30 I don’t know why some players do some stupid/dirty tackles.
That’s just restarted there was so much contact and it’s dumb because Seattle won the division last year
dunlap has more sacks in 3 games than clowney has had in 2 years...
did anyone else see how they didn’t include Arizona’s first touchdown in the video?
man this W felt good
Good win Seattle. That run game is the Time Stone. It gives Russ perfect vision.
Cowboys fan. Great game but Seahawks did get helped from the ref. This should've went to OT.
Drake..WORST ball handling RB in the league
Thank you Seattle. From a Bill's fan
Did Lockett dap the Ref? 4:10
When we couldve had carlos hyde instead of david johnson 🤦‍♂️😂
Pete Carroll dialed up a great defensive scheme to slow down Kyler’s scrambles
Tua's better haha!
WATCH TRUMP SILENT RUNNING 2020
Poor ref at the end
let go seahawks all the way  GO HAWKS 💙💚💙💚💙
Why did Arizona get 7 points even though no td 3:15
Honestly if Seattle didn't have those 2 major calls against them cards would of had 7 points
Literally the entire game I stared down Metcalf. Soooo overrated he only goes deep
What kind of human being has such self disrespect that they would put on a uniform as ugly as those green ones?
Carlos Hyde, nice game...
Josh Allens beat Seahawks. Kyler beat buffalo. Russel wilson beat cardinals.  NFL is crazy #gobills
@9:08 whoever edited this video should have really cleared up that it was NOT DK with the penalty but Kirkpatrick from the Cards.
It’s so obvious that these refs were in favor of Seattle  Edit: After watching the entire video almost every single call went against Arizona. 🤦🏻‍♂️
3:19 When your sideline calls out the play for you and they still get a first down 😆
Arizona be complaining about everything, grow up and play the game
I remember when, just like Ro Jo, Carlos Hyde was made fun of by fantasy gurus.  Well he goes and runs for 1,000 in Houston on 4.6 per carry, and now he’s looked good when getting carries in Seattle.  People acted like he wasn’t good in SF.  Their team was trash and he still had seasons with 59 catches, 988 yards rushing in 13 games, and another season close to 1,000 as well, despite battling injuries.  Happy for him.  And of course Ro Jo.  And drake
3:21 "WATCH THE SCREEEEN" And yet the defense did nothing until after about 10 yards.
Bruh if they would just get another 1st down then try to do for the touchdown like wtf that way Murray could’ve ran it in if he needed to
Looked like PI at the end of the game. Should have been 1st and goal at the 2 for the cards imo
When Russell has a run game, he's pretty much perfect. The defense stepped up big too. GG Arizona. See yall in the playoffs
Hawks be having some of the most quality players slip down the board to them in the drafts I swear. Def. A top notch front office
Im not trying hate but I dont like Murray. Idk if its his style or if he's overrated but the dude has a solid team especially WRs that he may never have again and he still doesn't look special out there.
As a bills fan this confuses me some how we beat the sea hawks but can’t beat the cardinals what the heck?
LMAO “DAM” 7:04
If Russ doesn’t win MVP this season....sumptin wrong!
Metcalf got tired of Peterson talking smack to him all night he took it to him
That TD to Lockett is a pass he's tried in the last three games and he would always get intercepted. Idk if he finally did it right or the Cards just weren't covering it that well.   Great W by the Hawks. Much needed. Defense looked hungry. Wonder if they will carry that attitude next games.   P.s.: Packers fan.
Why is cardinals 49 trying to break the legs of this dude?
How much did the Hawks pay the refs for that one?
Wilson vs Murray is starting to become a good rivalry to watch 👀👀
If you slow it down as slow as it go’s you’ll see it’s PI on both passes
I think ONLY AJ Hawk won money on this game!
I wish we could rematch the bills with a running game and our d playing good
GG
Cardinals lost due to 3 millions offside 😂 plenties.  It was dirty sloppy football
Cardinal receivers cost them a win or an overtime chance. Kyler Murray is HELLA GOOD.
Can we get some better highlights editors please?  I don't care about the flags that erases plays. Also when you show a play that could have been a touchdown or a fumble touch back, it would be nice to know which call was made.
Kylers throwing power was really cause of his shoulder and you could tell
Can defenses be allowed to play? The DPI against the guy defending Metcalf at the end of the half was bad.
And the pass iiissss CAUGHT! Pass is CaUgHt ....
Dre Kirkpatrick throws a swing  Metcalf: so you’ve chosen death  Referee: 15 yard penalty automatic 1st down
Great game, if the cards would've continued to pace themselves at the end of the last drive, instead of gunning it into the endzone , that would've tied things up
Kyler Murray looks like a create-a-player that's 5' and 100lbs
Not your best video. Horrible video.
My boys killed it
Happy birthday to me :)
Every single cardinals game there are flags every single play it’s annoying
These highlights are trash, good game but you don't see extra points, results of some flags the fight ect. nfl need to fix up
So apparently the sack on the first play of the game isn’t a highlight.
We’re not letting Russ cook, but rather, “simmer”.  Let’s go hawks
Kenny went for the win during last set of plays, when he was in 3rd down he had open receivers for 5-8 yd gain, smh.
How's the competition Murray
How was it 13-7 at one point and not 14-7 or 15-7?
Interesting officiating.
Oof, the Cardinals were playing two teams at once. The Seahawks and the Refs!
I am not a fan of either team here, but I thought refereeing in this game was a joke.
Murray is very talented, but you can tell he has a long way to go when it comes to decision making. Watch his last drive of this game(even just from this highlight) and he has plenty of time left with receivers open underneath on 3 of the 4 downs. Instead he tries deep balls into double coverage. Then on 4th down, he had some guys open, but he held the  all way too long and got sacked
How did Arizona score the first TD?
LOL that no call on Fitz in the endzone...sucksman.com
1. Seahawks  2. Cardinals  3. Rams 4. Niners
I didn't forget what a holes Troy and Joe are.
Seahawks swear they going to Super Bowl🤣🤣
Get Metcalf the ball as much as possible.
🔥Russle Wilson can Fuck’n ball. 🔥
At the 6:35 mark, Wilson is standing in a pocket that’s beautiful. I never thought I’d think that but WOW!
Damn 46 yds for Metcalf 🔥 🔥 guy is scorching
LMAOO Hopkins got handled by TRE FLOWERS. TRE. FLOWERS. Say goodbye.
Kyler Murray almost did it again. ALMOST!! 😂
Who ever edited this together did a terrible job.
I’m serious thinking DK is on PED . You gonna get caught on the next test bro
Something about those white helmets and the camera work makes the cardinals look tiny. And Kyler is a small guy as is
Murray Just put 21 points in the worst defense of the history of the nfl,  but people say that he is the mvp hahahaha
Could we not get even one replay for tds?
I'm glad Seattle was able to stop Kyler Murray from running, although he may have toned back on it because of the recent QBs who have been injured.
Man you can hear the silence in the stadium so sad
Damn the NFC tough while in the AFC it’s just the chiefs,Steelers,ravens an i guess the bills an titans.
Russ - fk it metcalf is out there somewhere Murray - fk it hopkins out there somewhere
Wow! officiating at its best???????? questionable
Rus seems to cook better when he’s got a sous-chef at hand.  (#FinsUp 🐬😁)
Man seattle had an extra couple of please in white and black this game ig
It hurts to see Pat Pete get bullied like that it looks like it’s about that time
As a Chiefs fan, watching the Cardinals run defense totally reminded me of the Chiefs run D. Totally incompetent.
Awesome game
nfl is full of bull with the no audience applause keep it real or is nfl fake
Overrated Cards LOL y’all need to stop hyping them up. They suck!!
Everyone after Sunday: Why the Cards are the NFCs best team and Kyler is MVP Everyone tomorrow: Why the Seahawks are the NFCs best team and Russ is MVP
How awsum was that?!
Refs ruin another game and I’m not even a fan of either team, why can’t they just stay out of the game at big time moments like that
Refs ruin another game and I’m not even a fan of either team, why can’t they just stay out of the game at big time moments like that
I knew I should have picked Seatle, especially after Cardinals won their last game but instead that made me change my mind. It seems there should have been more flags on Seatle's defence so a little unlucky. Lightning wasn't going to strike twice with a last gasp Cardinals TD though.
Seriously the person who came up with the construction outfit for Seattle should get an award.
Man Dunlap is a low key great pickup, he and Jamal Adams change that entire defence
Did that red fist bump locket at 4:10 ?😂
4:08 Did Lockett gives the referee a fist?
I don’t watch a lot of the NFL but I follow the Seahawks from a distance. I’ve been wondering how much better Russell Wilson would have been and could be with a good offensive line. Imagine what he could do if he wasn’t running for his life every other play.
I mean it’s all fun and games, but really, the loud crowd with zero people in the seats?....what else in my life is a lie??
Stupid playcalling by tge Cardinals. 40secs left , 1 timeout go get 10yards for the 1st down, whats the deal with those end zone throws at the end...
Where was this Seattle team last week? I know, Its very common for them to drop one game to the Rams & Cardinals every year, but still.
No one else notice the highlights brush over the first AZ TD? They make it look like a fumble and then in the next clip it’s 7-7.  Good work editor
Dk killed peterson
Seattle’s “defense” actually stepped up for the first time .. but Seahawks absolutely needed this W
I can't believe Seattle gave away the game last time. So infuriating! Bills and Rams dominated us, but we gave away the game against the cards.
Shouldve kept Josh Rosen Big Mistake Lol jokes
4:10 when the Ref fist bumps Lockett after that touchdown.... must have him on his fantasy line up tonight.
Go Seahawks to super blow vs Pittsburgh Steelers my Seahawks really need that win
Anyone saw locket bump fist the ref after the first touchdown??
This was thursday night football?  I'm just saying, I better not see Dallas on Sunday nights any more...the travesty lol
Kyler Murray: I'm the MVP Carlos Dunlap: Too soon son 👊🤣
A doozy
13:55 they could've called that a pass interference but that would've been a horrible call
Arizona lost this game plain and simple two costly stupid mistakes kept Seattle in this game. Actually three with that intentional grounding.
My God russ is just unbelievable
How come the player don't have to wear mask and we all have too. They are spreading covid-19 we just don't know it. All sports should be band for now
This game was amazing to watch!
This game is proof that certain refs need to go
Come on I thought Murray was better than Lamar Jackson? He can’t even beat the worst defense in the nfl and he has all the weapons in the world and Lamar has nun smh
RAaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this is the best way to watch a football game!
Why were they going for the long ball they had time! Get the damn firsts down smh
THAT WAS A GOOD ASS GAME....
This balanced attack of run and pass will lead Seattle deep into the playoffs. Division rival's is always a must win game!!
First Arizona TD.... whoever cut these highlights made it look like the fumble was the outcome :-/
Wait, at 3:10 it's 0-7. At 3:16 it's 7-7. Where's the highlight of the touchdown ???
They sound like Turkey's at some points
It took two 330lb guys in Brandon Shell and Mike Iupati to drag Dk away from that fight
Nooooo
Bro ik kenyan drake is special and ik he can be a top back in the league he just needs his o-line to step up and he needs to step up
Damn as a lions fan, i was excited to see  Prater hit that 59 yard field goal last week, just to have Sea kicker hit 61, finally forgot about it and the last play before ad, "longest kick: 61 yrds" damn now im salty again, The lions just cant have 1 thing.   Haha
Change these 2 commentators already. Terrible.. Pass is......... CAUGHT!!
In Russ I trust ( in my Shannon Sharpe voice)
I Miss some replays of TDs and some extrapoints :(
That is a good win by the seahawks in the game yesterday in life okay.
Nice watch. Thank you.
REF CHEATED 4 THE SEAHAWKS WHERE MY FLAGS REF
Does the NFL ever do trigger warnings when teams wear terrible uniforms?
Ref : Cardinals how many Flaggs do you want ?  Cardinals : Yes   Finally Seahawks are back in the Game !!!
It’s easier to walk barefoot through a cactus garden than to listen to Joe Buck call a football game
12:45 How is this NOT intentional grounding  if Murray's is..?
0-7 - Fumble Arizona, Recovery Seattle. Cut.  7-7.  How?
Chill on the flags damn
unless I'm color blind, it appears on the final drive Arizona had a spare timeout. Started taking deep TD shots a little prematurely there.
seahawks sikmişş
Hey NFL who cuts these Highlights AI? please show how the points are gained.
Not sure if fumble into end zone  or touchdown
Murray with that muffled voice sounds just like kenny from south park
Metcalf saw y'all comments
Yooo am I just baked or did they put the madden audience soundtrack over the video
The Cardinals with those silly, huge white helmets should be renamed the "Arizona Astronauts" or maybe the "Arizona Aliens".
This game was bullshit we would’ve won but they keep calling flags on us 😡
Kyler Murray looks small and his helmet makes him look like a bobble head.
Top defense!!! Seahawks is back!!!!
JOE BUCK IS...   WHACK!
Let's eat that win Seattle
Seahawks still runs the West
Arizona have 2 good backs in Drake and Edmonds...USE THEM YOU CLOWNS
Them cardinals misses Chandler Jones
"And there are two fouls on the play"  Oh well guess we'll never know what they are because as usual they've been edited out of the video
What a first game at Lumen Field! 💡⚡️
Patrick Peterson is WASHEDDD!!!!
Where is the Arizona run game?
I hope Kylers shoulder is ok. They were working on it all game long. I feel like that’s the reason the passing game was off today.
It's great to see The Seahawks play well. It makes many of the non contender years of the AFC West Division faded memories! 1976?
Yo Arizona lost because they went deep on 2nd and 3rd down instead of picking up short yards like they did the whole time they should’ve done like two more plays before going for the touchdown like just get the first down get in the red zone then try or jus get the firdt
If you’re going to show us a flag being thrown you better show us what it was for
These highlights from NFL are getting even worse. You're cutting the clips so short you cant even hear who got a carry or catch.  "Great run there by" *clip ends*  Now when Drake fumbles in to the end zone, all we see is Seahawks running away with the ball. No highlight of the review or the ref calling the play and the next play just starts with Seattle with the ball but Arizona have 7 on the board!? You're getting lazy with editing.
Someone explain where the Cardinals first TD came from?
The game certainly lived up to its billing.
When watching the game, the fake crowd noise cut out several times which actually made it quite nice. In my opinion, it's time to ditch it. We get it, they added it to try and get the proper feel of the game, but it's been long enough and we know fans aren't there. It's starting to seem like static and just seems annoying now.
Where’s them tweets from D-hop “never panic” 😂😂😂 #gohawks 💚 right back at you buddy
Hyde was balling
Murray lost AZ this game with the intentional grounding boy lost 17yrds. Lmao then he screams at his team for his stupid ass mistake.
Well the last two plays for the cardinals were PIs arguably the last wasn’t but on Larry for sure it was and they missed two delay of games on the Seahawks and we had the fumble recovery
Joe Buck is so annoying
They skipped Arizona's first TD...
This safety was as shame.
Kyler Murray: I'm the MVP Carlos Dunlap: Too soon son 👊🤣
THAT UNIFORM IS UGLY AF!
that was a pass interference at fitzgerald
can you show some more replays of the big plays please
The Cardinals deserve this L. 115 penalty yards including a silly one on 4th down.
When Drew retire I hope some how some way the Saints get Russ 😭😭 we would be unstoppable. A great Oline, Run game and weapons...and our defense is good
Late in the 4th quarter I was hoping for horrific act of God hail storm to give the game to Seattle by default or a forced holding call in the end zone for a safety. I'll take it.
"ok finally a good game from seattle without heart atta... Ok nevermind."
LMAO Shapeshifting
Murray what was that y’all had the game you should kept doing short route instead throwing hill Mary man 🤦🏾‍♂️
Bruh totally Refs game
Yo !! That was INTENSE
this is what happens when Russ gets some damn help!!... he had a run game that allowed him put less stress on being the guy to make plays and the defence showed up big time!! the defence clearly focused on locking up Kylers run game as much as possible and forced the Cardinals to be over do it at the end instead of shaving off the yards... this is the difference in having an experienced QB who can slow down the game for themselves and the team and a talent young QB who can't do it. Mahomes has this already, Watson too from the younger QB's.... Lamar and Kyler still need to learn it  Pete Carrol is finally starting to look like a defensive Head coach again and should keep it up and i would take SeaHawks as the team to beat if he can
WHO the hell decided to give the Seahawks such a horrible line green? What a discussing colour!
Refs wearing green and blue..
Seriously the person who came up with the construction outfit for Seattle should get an award.
My mom always said the Seahawks are like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.
Nice win for the refs team
why is he Seahawks and Cardinals against each other again?
Any one else find it weird how the lineman were playing I feel like there were so many missed false start calls
Ref to DK: ur ejected for fighting DK: Sorry, what? Ref: taunting, number 20 of the defense
Dangerrrrrrusssssss Seahawkssss 😎🏈
Ya'll weirdo fans happy about this pitty win after 3 loses in a row? Behind 5 teams in the nfc? Sure lets be happy about 1 penny given to us out of all the money in the world.
Did anyone else hear "watch the screen" right before Seattle threw a screen
goo hawks
Hawks back baby! Hope the cards enjoyed that 4 day lead
Yo that Seahawks O-line is pretty good, Russell was chillin out there.
Kyle Murray FUKN SUCKS! Good god, I can’t stand the way he plays
Cardinals o line is just bad
Dunlap!!! Dude's gonna dominate for SEA soon...
Now Will the newly formed Arizona fans kindly stop bringing up the reigning MVP?... The reigning MVP can at least beat russ in the pouring rain. No comparison....
The defense stepped up finally!!! When that happens he turns back into mvp russ
Wow, what was Jamal Adams (33) doing on that chase Edmonds TD?
That last play on 3rd down was a pass interference on Seahawks should have been called lmao them refs making that money on god
Ma Seahawks baybay
Seahawks defense is starting to look pretty good... other than all the penalties that defense created this game would have not even been close
Cards that is just a game. You will do much better in the coming games ❤️
Holding in the end zone causes a safety whatttt?
HAHA! You lost cardinals
Alligator arms Murray couldn't pull off the win
When Russell has a run game, he's pretty much perfect. The defense stepped up big too. GG Arizona. See yall in the playoffs
Cardigans with all the false start penalties when there were no fans’ noise to distract them. 🤣
7:19 on this video was one of my favorite parts of the game to watch
You think arizona is going to get another comeback? Think again. It will only last so long.
Imagine how kylers offense would do against legion of boom
Is it me, i feel like i see Patrick Peterson get beat alot more often now
Arizona O line played terribly this game.
2:07 everything about that catch could've been cut from this video.
So I take it the first fumble for Arizona wasn't a fumble then, despite the highlights suggesting it was - seeing as Arizona suddenly had 7 points in the next frame...? Bad editing!
Even as a Chiefs fan, I still rooted for the Cardinals. i believed they were the underdogs. if Seattle plays good and to their potential, they can be dangerous any given game! Russ is special, and the run game was DESPERATELY needed! If the Seattle want to be playoff contenders, they have to play more consistently such as this game👏👏👏👏
These highlights suck. At 3:00 it goes from 0-7 game, shows a potential fumble, doesn’t show any confirmation on the fumble or anything, then shows the score as 7-7 and doesn’t even show how the cardinals scored. But thank God we got multiple shots of a DK catch that got called back by holding anyway. Also the two 15 seconds ad back to back are nice. Get your stuff together NFL.
The rb hitch run has to be the worst play in football
NFL - sort out your highlights. Show some replays of stuff - like injuries, touchdowns (especially when a review involved). Come on....
I'm sorry.  Where did the Cards score their first TD?  Ya not gonna show that?
Penalties and the o line really lost the game for Arizona. Glad Seattle won so this division can stay competitive and interesting.
A 46 yard penalty, coach better chew them out to the high heavens.
4:10 AM I TRIPPIN ...OR DID LOCKETT JUST FIST BUMP THE REF?? AT 👀👀 4:10
Have any of you noticed a fake crowd sound in the background when the Hawks get a touchdown?
3:20: "WATCH THE SCREEN!". However they couldnt stop the screen...
The birds are always fun
THIS GAME WAS A GOOD ONEE I LOVED IT SO MUCH I WANT TO JOIN NFL BUT IM ONLY 8 😭😭😭😭 SEAHAWKS MY TEAMMMMM
Great game
Love how you can hear most of what the players are saying with no fans in the stands 😂 felt bad for Seattle's nose tackle on that one off sides play lmao but good battle either way! Don't really have a favorite NFL team but I always did have a soft spot for the cardinals since Tyrann got with em, also loved that play where you clearly heard a cardinal on defense yell "watch the screen!" And nobody was on it and they played the screen 😂 damn I wish I stuck with foosball
Dk Metcalf probably the most slept on draft pick in history of nfl its ridiculous the analytics where way off on this guy biggest steal in nfl history
The refs missed that call on Fitzgerald smh
3 pass interferences not called on Seahawks doesn't suprise me. They play dirty to win
Bo Scarbrough is a really good rb if you give him some more reps
SEA -3 And The Under 🔥
Cardinals lost because penalties that will play with more discipline as the season goes on I can see them going far in the playoffs
beautiful play design at 8:16. Clear up the middle with ease.
damn, im a seahawks fan but you can see the QB from cardinals was tryna his ass off, bro mad quick, close game!
Carlos Hyde is looking sharp in our backfield
Wilson is the most elusive player I’ve seen in a long time. The guy always makes defenders miss.
3:18 defensive player yells "watch the screen!".  seattle throws a screen for a first anyways lol
wow good game, let me guess Seattle fans were having chest pains the whole time.
Never bet against greatness; Russ does it again.  The Hawks are back in business baby!  Sending the pigeons back home along with their little midget QB.
Dame we could use Cardinals Qb 💯
All I'm seeing is the refs helping the Seahawks
Proud of my team. Seattle came together and played on both sides of the ball. Gg to cards. Go Hawks!
This was a huge game. Joe buck acts like its preseason. Makes electric plays seem boring. Whe will they get rid of his boring ass.
Tre flowers really clamped up hopkins 💀
Bill No-Brian: D Hopkins:. .😡 Carlos Hyde: 😴 David Johnson:  🤓
Feels nice seeing our most recent trade acquisition sealing the game for us.
When are the referees going g to call holding on both sides , you may as well let th QB stand there with all the time to throw the ball
These are the games where you miss "Beast Mode"! He would've ate tonight!
Refs were definitely being nicer to Seattle, helped alot.
they need to draft o-lines on the next draft cause the ones AZ got are terrible
Maybe they were trump supporters
Hopkins got locked up
Battle of the West Coast  gotta love it.. Great game!!! 🔋🔌
I feel like this game was rigged
It was all reff's game there where calls that didnt get called against seahawks
nfl=wwe
who edits this videos smh 😡... someone explain tell them what a replay is...
Feed dk the ball more
At 3:20 somebody said to watch the screen and they still didn’t see it coming 🤣
DK’s release at 1:48 😳
What a great game. GoHawks
Cardinals vs the refs
Seattle lucky team must’ve been that Irish green jersey
Honestly NFL, your highlight cutting is one of the worst I've ever seen. You add an unimportant False Start penalty by Cardinals, followed by a 3 yd checkdown to Fitzgerald turning into a 4th&Long, but the important referee decission of Drake's TD was not shown and the spectators think it was a fumble.  Please improve it!
Watched the fitz play multiple times. He was interfered, but I could see why they didn't call it. Go Steelers!
2 Good Offences.. but not Offensive lines
Always nice when it's clear what the refs were told prior to the game. Evidently NFL makes more money off Seattle.
Why was that hit on D Hop at 7:29 a flag. They must just want the Wr to have all the clean catches
Far from Hail Murray. What a choke at the end. Omg.
Guess the goat tre flowers is back.
Russell Wilson might be the goat....
Seahawks and Cardinals: How about this time we see who can get more flags this game?
Seahawks actually had a D tonight but they got away with crucial calls on the last drive. Could’ve easily been PIT
“Pass is caught”
We all know Miami is winning the super bowl this year
Cardiac Cardinals... if there's a critical game they need to win, don't worry... they find a way to loose it.
Last week was a fluke the cardinals are who we thought they were a .500 team
really nice game ... really nice.
Did Mr. Lockett fist bump an official after scoring the touchdown at 4:10? What's that all about? 🤣
Carlos Hyde + Chris Carson Seattle mvp
Who the hell edited this video?!?! NFL highlights have been real bad this season
Seattle one of the most humble teams ever Russ changed everyone
As long as Russell dont forget to run we cant be beat
Looked like P.I. to me on the last drive.
If the heart attacks are back that means we are back to winning i love it and hate it
Dunlap did his thing that game 🔥🔥
What's the deal with the highlights not showing the Cardinals' first TD? Or did I miss something? Around the 3:01 mark of the video.
Seattles Offensive Line deserve Credit, They were looking real nice out there
This makes me really miss Carlos Dunlap as a Bengals fan
Dude yells watch the screen at 3:22
Murray is not better than lamar.
Garbage ass fake crowd noise...
Great team Seattle, but lucky aswell
Damn DK is so nice
why isn't the first cardinals TD in the video?
3:30 "Watch da screen" and sure thing it was a wide receiver screen that got converted for a first down so Lamar Jackson have no reason to complain about the defense calling out his plays, they still have to stop it.
Arizona future does look bright.
i love being able to hear the players. no enhanced audio
What about Cardinal's first 7 points? Who edited them out?
why didn’t they show Arizona’s first touchdown?
Are defense still could be a little better
Cardinals are ass
Can we get a shock collar for Joe buck that zaps him every time he says "pass is caught"?
Careful Uncle Pete,you jumping all over the place lol we need that knee healthy 😔lol
REVENGE!!
Jesus loves you. He died for our sins and resurrected on the third day. The pay of sin is death. We need to repent from our sins and accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior. He is coming soon, follow him
The cheating reminds of the Patriots. I guess the Seahawks are now the NFL's baby.
Sometime, I just love the sound of a quiet stadium. The raw ness of the action sound is amazing
I feel like we need some highlight replays from another angle for several big plays or even some flags
tre flowers is shops dad😈
Who's editing these highlights? How come you don't show the Drake rush td being reviewed?! All of a sudden it a 7-7 game and for a person coming to see the highlight because they missed the game, there is a lot of stuff that is left out. Get better NFL!
It sucks being a Seattle fan cause I always have a heart attack in the 4th quarter when we’re up by only 1 score.
Cardinals dumb. They were doing fine with the short throws and catches getting closer to the goaline. With plenty of time left
Two quarterbacks so similar 😳
Who the hell makes this highlights videos?? You show plays irrelevant with 0 interests and then decides that you don’t get the replays of the key plays that can’t be seen at normal speed...
Seahawks defense played great, offense played good enough, O-line needs improvement, Russell Wilson is under pressure too much.
If you try to fight D.K. Metcalf, it looks like a bad life decision
if only they kept going for the first :( no need to air it out they had time, magic only works once. Im sad
Everytime some team loses they we everytime against that same team the second time unless there the eagles Vikings or the panthers for the Seahawks we always beat them
Undeserved
4:10 Now i see how the Seahawks won this game .🤔😏😧lol  #DapGate..maybe someones getting paid off🕵🏿🕵🏿
Ref to DK: ur ejected for fighting DK: Sorry, what? Ref: taunting, number 20 of the defense
The intentional ingrounding was the most stupidest call ever
These edits are terrible this season. One minute the Seahawks are near the end zone, the next clip they're back in their own half of the field! And what happened to the first Cardinals TD?! Who is getting paid to edit this
good game AZ. wouldnt doubt us seeing u in the playoffs
As a fan of both teams, great game all around, last drive was just stupid decision after stupid decision by the cardinals, also that “pass interference” on Patrick Peterson vs metcalf was bs, great play by Patrick Peterson, shouldn’t have been a penalty
Anyone else see Lockett give that ref a fist bump @4:09
How many penalties did the Arizona o lineman get I mean my god😂😂😂😂
Two decent teams but nothing for the Packers to fear should they manage to get to the post season.
Horseshit calls, the interference call.on Arizona in the 3rd quarter that gave Seattle a score was much less than the interference that occurred at the end of the game on Fitzgerald near the end zone that did not get called.  The games appear to be fixed to some degree.  NFL is glorified WWE
Maybe Ken Norton ain’t that bad after all 🥸
Kyler plays like a kid Russ like a man
That’s how you play football Seattle!!!!!!! 💚💙💚💙
did anyone else notice locket fistbumping the ref at 4:10
Never understood running routes to the end zone when you can extend the game by picking up a first down...
Bad vision 😌
Go Hawks!
Called the game Seahawks by 7 in Russ I trust thanks for wining me a couple bands god bless
i think joe buck should wait until something happens to use the words "and" or "is." calling it while it happens is i think why viewers don't like him. "and the pass iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis" or "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand incomplete"
Drink every time He says: "Pass is.... Caught"
To much flags for the cards, they stoped the hawks and that little drama gave them 7 points.
Seattle defense still not great, but they stepped up when they needed it most!
Again, a play on the first Arizona score where you have no idea what happened because the highlights don't show the reply. Really bizarre way of doing this. What is so difficult about just showing the replay and the onfield call?
ARIZONA CARDINALS FAN REACTS TO FRUSTRATING LOSS VS SEATTLE SEAHAWKS VIDEO!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMbof2y580
kyler is gonna be a problem
Im just confused why the cards were holding so much against the worst d line in the league
Did anyone notice Lockett fist bumping the ref after his TD ?
Russ is back in business? (MVP?)
4:11 fist bumps the ref😂
That o line for az was rough
Cardinals are weak like always
Hopkins is the NFL Damian Lilliard > Close enough 🙄
3:19 clearly didnt watch it hard enough
Seahawks need new uniforms, these ones are hideous and colors don't match.
What a first game at Lumen Field! 💡⚡️
This is a terrible editing job on this clip. For some reason they showed a random false start penalty. Who cares? And then, they showed what appeared to be a Cardinals fumble into the end zone recovered by Seattle, but in the next frame the Cardinals have an unexplained 7 points. Get it together NFL video editors!!!
Somewhere is the person who designed that Seahawks outfit, and they know they were wrong...
Yo
who designs the teams uniforms? they suck
Lol so many penalties in this match like 6 false starts too
Kyler should recover with this massage gun  https://ultifitperformance.com/products/ultifit-pro
Are the Seahawks showing support for the Yellow Vesters?
Seattle got beat by the Bills, and the Cards beat the bills. I don't think Jamal Adams played against the Bills due to injury, if so then he is the difference maker.
I'm so excited for DJ Dallas, that was such a cheeky little first down run 6:18 So much energy when he actually gets going.
Tyler lockett really dapped up the ref after scoring the td 💀😂 4:10
Gg
Refs got paid big tonight
Whew. What a game!!!
At 5:53 Lamar would have made that play just sayin...🤷🏿‍♂️
Fire the idiot who fumbles on the one yard line, unforgivable.
How tf did we lose to the Seahawks 🤣
And people were asking why they did not run it in more in the endzone last time. Now you got the answer.
I liked Murray untill he didnt wanna shake hands with the winning team like the Fins,,  “SHAME”
Everyone was so focused on Kyler Murray, they forgot who the other QB was, not anymore.
That was our game!!! Kirkpatrick fucken ruined it. Our O line was trash too, how do you let a flag that gets you a safety at such a crucial time.
The Seahawks learned their lesson from week 7. You don’t drop back in coverage against Kyler Murray and the Cards unless you have a better secondary. Kyler and the Cards’ offense needs to get better against the blitz. Against better QBs and offensive lines... AKA Rodgers and the Packers and Brady and the Bucs, Seattle would get burned a lot blitzing that many times against either offense, and those are the teams they will eventually need to beat in January. Seattle’s defense does alright against teams who have a hard time dealing with the blitz, but I don’t see them winning any shootouts against either Green Bay or Tampa in the playoffs.
Is Arizona a small defense or Seattle just big  and physical?
Seahawks need to wear that Action Green in the SB! 7-0 wearing them! #GoHawks
Are We Gonna Talk About How The Seahawks Wore The Wrong Pants - Jersey Combo? Wasn't it supposed be All Lime Green.
8:37  that move tho
Kyler shouldn't be hanging his head. Dude is turning things around for the cards big time. I know he hates losing and I know there's lots of other great players on the cards doing their part, but be proud man. They wouldn't have the record they do without you.
Seattle won this game with the refs bullshit.
Season ain't over yet band wagon sea chicken fans.
Flower got to Go !!!!!!
That intentional grounding was the biggest turning point of the game imo. Without it the Cards probably don't gift Seattle with a safety putting the game out reach by a field goal alone.  The NFC West race just got a lot tighter. Gonna be a photo finish at the end of the season.
People out here really disliking highlights??😂
When we get anyone to replace Trey flowers? I'll take anyone off the practice squad. He's horrible!
Good Call at 7:33 at a minimum thats unnecessary roughness. Its crappy Hopkins had to call his own foul what is this 1-11 call your own fouls?
That football gods were not in favor of the cardinals on this night.
Cards really out here making Flowers look like a pro bowler
DK is a great player but Pete really needs to straighten him out. He clearly has anger issues and has been involved in multiple fights this year on the field. The last thing the Seahawks need is for him to ejected during a playoff game
The cardinal's helmets seems higher than others team's helmet
all you Seahawk fans that jumped off the bandwagon last week should continue to stay away.. keep that loser mentality and go watch the jets, alone in your mom's basement
Hold in the inzone is ever the defining factor in a superbowl that ref better stay in protective custody
Again, the Referees decide the game.  This is the 23rd time this has been posted this season
4:08 Did the ref give him a fist bump?  That seems very biased.
These highlights were awful, it showed what looked like a fumble as a TD, made out a Metcalf punch gained the Seahawks a first down and never showed the missed PAT 🤦‍♂️
GO HAWKS
This should show people that the rams defense is elite I see the Seahawks defense getting more credit then the rams defense like my god like people need to realize that the rams are a good team
Russell Wilson is MVP 2020. Hands down
Everybody before the game: *”Murray is the best QB in the west and the Cards will win this game easy”* The Seahawks: *”and I took that personally”*
go for the first down you will only have lucky catches 1 in ever 100 times Cards!!!! smh
3:20 my man called it 😂🧐
Hawks: big improvement on defense and a bit of a ground game. Works... minus the flags.
The #1st offense and two of the best offensive players vs the #32nd defense missing both of their starting corners.... how did this game end this way???
Murray had a couple open guys near or in the endzone twice and was off the mark or late.   Dudes were open, he missed them.
Hahaha Jamal Adams is just sitting around this whole game. Maybe a decoy but he was in zone in a 2-3 yard bubble Seahawks gave up a lot for a player leaving in a year
3:20 he said it and they still had a good play
Kyler running looks comical. Like a cartoon character.
Lol why he just didn’t throw it up like last time might tie the game or won
3:20 Cards player called the screen and they still gave up the 1st down😂😂
And the Seahawks didn't even have Christopher Carson. Imagine him back?
Ty god for the last sack otherwise i bet u anything it OT
Bruh!!! Did tyler lockett "dap" the referee @ 4:09!?
BLITZ BOY giving up a wide-open touchdown LOL
where's diggs' hit?
Great game but please for the love of God Russ please throw to DK more. It’s pretty clear by now what happens when he gets the ball in his hands it’s always a big play...I get he dropped one in the endzone but if you give him more targets nothing is stopping the offense
Where was this for the past 2 weeks Seattle?????? GG's Cardinals
Go Seahawks! Much better game, better balance. Nice to see Carlos back. Thank you for stepping up defense (still need to find a new home for Flowers). Can’t believe Lewis did as well as he did at center. Hope with the mini bye the rest of our injured can get back for week 12. Have a good rest guys!
This the first time I ever seen 2 teams wear all dark colors
dunlap lol
Good win Seahawks. Let's go🔥🔥🔥
Pass is...CAUGHT!
Clutch defense
☺️
Poooooona!
Let’s go go Hawks
Why not just get 10 yards first???
As a bills fan. This is satisfying
Cardinals would have won if that didn’t have a flag every drive.
Metcalf! Goat
bruh, how come the seahawks defense gives up a historic amount of passing yards but for some reason decide to play like the legion of boom when I have Dhop and Fitzgerald starting on my fantasy team, wtf.
Must see tv i like the 2;quarterbacks go at it wilson murray
Holding In The End Zone Results In A Safety Stupid
Zona sold their soul for that Bills W, Seattle was lock city
I am so glad they showed that holiday of the false start🤣🤣🤣
SWEEEEEETHAWKS! YAY! Russell Wilson Record Wins!!! SWEET!! YAY! GO HAWKS! ☆Lv
REFS VS CARDINALS
What a game! Kyler is such a stud 👏🏾👏🏾
Worst officiated game iv ever seen, this was not a good game 😐 so many bs flags reffs gave Seahawks this game like the rest of their wins this season.
game winning sack the tackle steps up into he edge rusher instead of dropping back lol... bruh what? and the guy just swims around him easy and gets the sack
All Seattle needs is to give Russ some assistance and not have him needing to perform miracles each week to get them over the line. Truly great and all as he is, it's not sustainable. They stepped up tonight and they get the dub👏🏻(Even though I'm not a Seattle fan, watching Russell Wilson in full flight is an absolute pleasure).
Rams best team in the NFC west 💯
We're back baby! Go Hawks!
Seahawks made a big defensive statement tonight
still undefeated in color rush i think
Sorry I am not pro at this, but how did the pass interference gave Cardinal 46 yard penalty? That's the largest yardage penalty I have heard..
4:09 12th man really showed up today huh? 🤣🤣
The sideline celebrating the sack!!! Locket jumping up ♥
Y’all already know who run this division 😈
4:10  we see you refs. You're a big fan
Yeah this was a bitter loss but this was a strong loss, which is good for Kyler I think. These kind of games are the difference between a superbowl and first game out in the playoffs. You have to learn how to bounce back from a shitty situation, and I think Kyler shows he's able to do that. ...His o-line however...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand CAUGHT.
Miracle: Not Today!
13:55 was Pass Interference he got there a bit early.
Patrick Peterson considering retirement.
So at 4:14 they missed the extra point?? WE NEED TO SEE THIS!
Diggs is the best receiver in the game he hasn't gotten locked up all season stats prove he's the best in the game
No Hail Murray tonight? Lol. #notallthat
Next we have the eagles
I know Murray likes to stutter step to avoid tackles then take off. But when you only need one yard, just run!! He blew at least two drives by not just securing the first down and over complicating it!
All I saw is a lot of calls only going 1 way, the way I see it it’s hard to win against an NFL (refs) favorite
Arizona vs Seattle(feat. Refs)
Seahakws D was good but can get better if Tre Flowers can stop leading the league in social distancing 😂😂😂
RusseLL WiLson Won Again Just Like i WAS Guessing Before The NFL FootbaLL Game Started i WAS Guessing Larry FitzgeraLd An HiS Arizona NFL FootbaLL Team WAS Gone Lose Againest RusseLL WiLson NFL FootbaLL
What's up with D hop, look at his game log. He has over a 100 yard one game and goes under the next game then it repeats again and again. Might be important for fantasy owners to know. Go Hawks though lol
Bruh they didn’t even show Arizona’s first touchdown lol, was it not a turnover? Did he cross the goal
That was PI on Fitzgerald on the last drive
4:10 When the ref has Lockett on his fantasy team
The Seahawks will not go anywhere as far as they should.... if they don’t truly revamp their Dline... yeah they stepped up today... but they are no where consistent enough to go to the NFC Championship, let alone the SuperBowl.... they gotta do something . I hope they do.... cuz all they need is a consistently stout D... they are Super Bowl bound.
All you fair weather hawk fans were calling russ trash last week and arizona fans were saying murray is better than wilson, shut up and eat that humble pie! Russ had a couple bad games, the defense was awesome tonight,  the O line played well, russ got out the pocket a lot and made plays and the run game was great! If this continues and Seattle can keep clicking they are a very dangerous team going into the playoffs! Go hawks!! Back on top
Let’s go LET RUSS COOK!
seahawk fan saying defence finally showing up after conceding 21 points
This funny cus they makin pat pete look like a little boy 🤣🤣 Dk and Carlos Hyde
At 14:17 he had the guy on the top side open if he were to throw it a lit tile early
Larry FitzgeraLd Be Trying To Win Arizona A NFL FootbaLL Championship By HiS SeLf it Been That WAY Since Larry FitzgeraLd Been On ArizonaS NFL FootbaLL Team NFL FootbaLL
Man, Carlos Dunlap was clutch for the Seahawks with those two sacks.  Brought some life to that defense.
1:04 if that was the SECOND time he was sacked, why didn't we see the first one? 🧐
Did Lockett dap up the official after that first td
This jersey matchup is goated
Russell get it done Wilson - MVP From a colts fans.
Good game brother's......good game...good win Seahawks
Who won?
Dunlap was an underrated trade and its paying off.
Can they make the helmets just a little bigger?
Larry FitzgeraLd NFL FootbaLL
Russ didn't turn it over, they had a run game, d stepped up. Seattle needed that bad.
Seahawks can’t seem to get margin
Overrated Cardinals.
Thursday Night FootbaLL NFL FootbaLL SeattLe Verse Arizona RusseLL WiLson Won im Guessing Before The NFL FootbaLL Game Started NFL FootbaLL
Was a good game but I have no idea what Arizona was doing on the final drive. 3 lazy endzone lobs into double/triple coverage, forcing the issue with 2 timeouts, and only 30 yards to go with plenty of time on the clock. I was so confused by the terrible play calling.
Primetime with no 12th man 😩            GO HAWKS! RUSS!
Wow no fans for a TV game but you can clearly here thousands of fans 🤔🤦🏿‍♂️
The fact that Seattle only allowed 7 points the first half was VERY surprising to me. Defense needs work for sure
i lost money on Arizona tonight, i am looking forward to Green Bay packing a lot of fudge this Sunday.
4:09 lockett fist bumped a ref😂
GG cards, in a few years you guys will be real contenders!!!!
Ken Norton “alright I’ll try to coordinate this time “
Murray sounds like he's saying "Set Hut" with his mouth closed.
Go cardinals! Gg!
i have a new middle name for Russ.  his name is:  Russ "if i see DK one on one I have to look at the other side first then maybe look at DK" Wilson.  I don't know if Russ is jealous of DK becoming the face of the franchise and want to sabotage him but what is up with the dude.  you have a 6'4" 230ibs freak of nature against an over the hill 6' 200ilbs CB and you hesitate to throw it?  Like against Ramsey, i don't know what Russ is afraid of throwing to DK when its one on one.  Neither of the so called elite corners are going to out muscle or out jump DK in slants or deep balls.  when one on one DK should get a initial target pass attempt every time soon as the ball is snapped.
D really stepped up, Russ had no turnovers and Carlos Hyde played great. This is the Seattle team that will contend with any team in the NFC.
Huge W for dem Seahawks
I love Metcalf as a Seahawks, but I swear I heard the name Metcalf said at least a hundred times this game...commentators tellin Russell to  just chuck it deep
Still think Seattle should ditch the neon lime uniforms. They're just gaudy
Let’s not act like kyler Murray didn’t just shift Jamal😭
11:14 - That's were the comparisons between Kyler and Russ need to stop. Wilson would never chew out his teammates like that. Especially when you just committed a dumb ass penalty as you're trying to put together a 4th quarter go ahead drive for first place in the division! Put your big boy pants on Murray!
Gyawww dayumn! 9:17
Greg Olsen brandon shell and bo Scarborough are hurt
4:07 did he fist bump the ref? Is that normal?
Well it wasn’t real pretty but glad they got the win
Cardinals reminded me of the Vikings this game. Smh. Could of won the game but too many mistakes and penalties.
Why would you put in a cut of them saying Metcalf threw a punch when it was clearly the other guy?
Finally a win at the end Dunlap with the winning sack
With a light schedule ahead, Seattle should win the NFC West Division this season.
Wow big help for seahawk shame nfl
good to see the seahawks bounce back after a horrible 2 weeks
I love Larry Fitzgerald even as a Seahawks fan. At the age of 37 he is still out there making great catches. With that said Larry aint the man no more. You gotta let the game be in Deandre Hopkins hands for the endzone play not Larry. Arizona wasting the talent they have currently. Good game tho.
💚
Seahawks are good. But they dont have the hardest schedule.  Just sayin. Get mad
nba thrown out the game moments https://youtu.be/CdP48lTcQ44
Jesus the Arizonas rushing game was trash. Can't not let Russell have the much time with dk and locket
nba thrown out the game moments https://youtu.be/CdP48lTcQ44
Damn good game best yet this year.
Tre flowers is better than all of the bills secondary😂
Everyone subscribe to my channel please it only takes 2 seconds‼️‼️‼️🙏🏾🙏🏾 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHtnBPXEuOCA19IbGdrIMg
The refs shouldn't have flagged Kirkpatrick, that literally was so detrimental to the whole game. Like fights are fights. Just eject the players. Don't punish the whole team.
cards o line really lost them the game crazy
at 3:20 they say, "Watch the screen" and Seattle throws a screen for a first down hahaha
Locket getting bullied😂😂
Metcalf is my favorite player! He stood up for locket! Thats a real team player..
They sure didn’t show when Russell had two delay of games in the 4th but let him snap the ball and a false start on the Right tackle that they just let blow by you could see it when you watched it live that really changed the whole game
The fkn lineman... gave seahawks 5 points.
Refs were trash on both sides like can we get some new refs lol
Getting Carson back is gonna be big for Seattle run game.  I wouldnt get excited about tonight tho,  my cards were playing practice squad guy on the D-line.
No one:   Cardinals O-line: ight imma head out
This game was pretty boring...   :(  . The curse of TNF. Was really hoping for OT. At least I called the game right, though. I said the team with the birds on their helmet will win tonight. My coworkers didn't believe me. I proved them wrong
See ya in the playoffs
Cardinals: Watch that screen!!!  Cardinals: Then gives up a screen.
Isn't that late deep pass to the 11 supposed to be a Pass Interference ?
Seattle Seahawks 💚💙💚💙💚💙   P.S. Couldn’t find a hawk emoji so 🦅
The fake crowd noise when the fight happened 😂😂😂😂
Kyler Murray's height and size of his helmet makes him look like a kid
Those Seattle uniforms are awful
The MVP FOR THE SEAHAWKS THE REFFSSS
I want Chris Carson back leave a like if you agree
Glad Russ started running again. He limits his game when he just tries to scramble and trow instead of picking up yards.
Got Damn! 46 yard penalty! 👀😳
Love my team!!!! Let Russ Cook!!!!
Even have to mute the Highlights. Joe Buck is horrrible
pisses me off that the play to Metcalf didn't count, that was not a hold!!!!
4:10 Lockett fist pumps ref
Good game!💪💯 Finally an emotional game in 2020😁
Yeah we totally won the Dunlap trade Go Hawks. Cards are Sweepless in Seattle.
Ref probably got fined 75k for partaking in a fist bump
Diggs just hits anything that moves as hard as he can, penalty or not 😑
Rigged game no doubt
Diggs just hits anything that moves as hard as he can, penalty or not 😑
We back up on top BOYZZZZZ!!!! #GoHawks #12thMan 💚💙💚💙💚💙💚💙💚
Murray lost the game in the final 5-6 minutes of the game. Starting with the intentional grounding penalty; putting them in a goal line offensive position, ultimately causing a safety in the end zone. Which lead to 2 points (21-25). Then, that led to Seattle kicking a field goal, making the game (21-28) -7 point differential. Leading to the final drive, Murray panicked; instead of taking the intermediate routes in the zone coverage, especially on 2rd down, he took a deep shot to Fitzgerald in triple coverage (incomplete).  3rd down, takes another attempt into deep zone coverage, trying to force a play; once again going (incomplete). Then finally, the defense comes for him on 4th down, forcing a quick decision, but it's too late "SACK"!!! GAME OVER!!! Because 1 error made the game a touchdown difference. Lost, in the final 5 minutes.
Carlos Dunlap made his statement
Seattle is back to leading the division keep it that way
3:19   Defense:  WATCH FOR THE SCREEEEEEN!  Russ Wilson:  It’s gonna be a yes from me dawg
Can anyone say the refs decided that game with non calls yup
That 1st touchdown by Russ was an ABSOLUTE DIME!
These Highlights are pretty Bad..  Not showing a slow mo after drake td.. and showing many nonsense plays which doesn't matter...
I can see both of these teams meeting again in the playoffs. We got a good rivalry on our hands, fellas.
Who y'all got Sub:For Russel Wilson  Like: For Kyler Murray    Lmao I just need some subs sry for the self promo lmaoooooooo
They could got the first then call a timeout....i hate when football team  do use there timeout wisely ✅
Wilson is becoming greater and greater
Seahawks sayin not so fast Cards YOU IN MY HOUSE! 5-0
Im already very happy with the season arizona is having. This was a make or break for them and i think we wont see them in playoffs. Maybe in callig it too early
all i see is the refs dictating who wins games: this season is just for advertisement . I am not a fan of any of these teams but all the games i have seen this season has been controlled by refs aggressive and nonaggressive penalties .
russel wilsons pocket prescence is inspiring.
I blame it on Kyler and run game He should’ve capitalized on the D Hop matchup all night they single covered him most of the game if you watch and he only was targeted 5 or 6 times.
Russ was great, the defense was great, our rbs were great. We needed this game gg cardinals
Dk should’ve had 3 tds on Pat Pete but one bad game against a top 2 corner in Ramsey and people forget how special he is got Pat pete a couple times going deep
Dunlap stepped up. Need to fire our coordinators tho...
And just like that the MVP race is even once more
Wilson didnt turn the ball over Metcal got catches The defense forced punts and rushed passes This is the Seattle we need
Trash Murry
Ngl, Diggs be putting in work
The refs very clearly had a favorite and I'm a rams fan
Strangest way ever to get to 28 points: touchdown (XP), touchdown (none), FG, touchdown (XP), safety, FG
These officials are love grubbing point-shaving crooks
https://youtu.be/i-1lQ2-h7sk
Cardinals cannot fly high  Maybe on their dreams
The flip to Hyde was the dumbest playcall
Hawks defence finally did their job today. Well done guys.
Let go Seahawks 👍👍👍👍👍
Both the seahawks and cardinals are gunna be in the playoffs.
Nobody's gonna talk about how Hyde ran over Peterson like a dump truck 😆
Ps5
Ever since they traded for Dunlap Seattle has had 13 sacks in the last 3 games. Dunlap has turned that pass rush into something respectable. Now if Seattle’s secondary gets healthy, I wouldn’t be surprised if the defense becomes a very good unit as the season progresses.
GG Seahawks! Good luck to you guys the rest of the season!
No flag for Fitzgerald lol ok series has to stay even.
When every aspect of Seahawks step up (Defense, OL, Running Back, QB and kicker), Seahawk can roast the enemy slowly but surely. Even this game is very close, I don't feel the heart attack. Perfect game !
BS not even a Cardinals fan and they were getting held on every play..usual garbage from the nFL
Pass interference at the Larry that should of been a touchdown
Let the kid grow... Not all rookie qbs are playing for a team that's is perfectly set it for them to shine and dominate! Patrick maholmes wouldnt have gotten an mvp and a ring if he were playing for the Jets. Kyler is more impressive than maholmes in my opinion, playing for the sorry cardinals with a rookie coach... Maholmes was handed the keys to a Ferrari from day 1
Murray is a poor man’a Russ... he no where near Lamar even
I have to say. Kyler Murray played a clean ass game
ill take a heart pounding game over terrible preformances
Arizon QB throwing
editing on this video is very iffy
Dk was like no  Ramsey no problems😭💀
Who put together this highlight video?  *Spends 15 seconds on a false start. *Spends 30 and shows multiple angles of a play that didn't even count because of a penalty. *Ends Arizona's touchdown play by making it look like Seattle got the fumble without showing the part where the play was reversed.  The hell?
See what happens when we have a run game rly good defense as well
Bruh the ref at 4:10literally dapped up lockett after his touchdown 💀😂
7:03 no. 33 had a easy block but gave up it looked like.
Shout out to all the rookies and backups who stepped up. D Lewis who never played center and only had a few days to practice stepped up big time. A couple backups O-line men stepped up also after shell went down. Mad props to Tyler Lockette who literally played in so much pain cuz of his knee spring. Shout out to DK for blocking and stood up for his teammate, Tyler. And last but not least all the Running Backs who stepped up, Hyde, Bo and Dallas. 👍👍👍 And the defense stepped up big time and won us the game! Amazing job 👍
🏈🏈🏈
Seattle looked good tonight!
Refs are so bad holy Crap, horrible calls on both sides
Too bad either of these teams combined couldn’t score 13 points on that Saints Defense lol.
Ya lol can’t win
Gucci beat jeezy
7:23 so nobody gonna talk abt drake knocking to grown man down at once. Aight just asking
Horrible playcalling for cards. Run it u have time. Too many pass go for it all plays
lETSSS GOOO HAWKS 💚💙💚💙 baby 💙💚💙💚
Damn, metcalf dropped that td catch... point blank.
dunlap has more sacks in 3 games than clowney has had in 2 years...
Pete Carroll and the Seahawks are terribly over-rated.  They are winning by the narrowest of margins. More luck than talent.
Seahawks play only one good team in the final 6 weeks and that’s at home where they’re still unbeaten. They should win the NFC West.
The clone loses to the original.
YAYA a win finally defense stepped up
I can believe it the Seahawks won what I didn’t want them to win why Cardinals
"Both feet in Lockett", good game.😎✌️
YO SEATTLE FOR LIFE TIL I DIE EVEN WHEN THEY LOOSE!!! 🔋💀
Buck is terrible.
Finally a good game for the seahawks. Both teams played great.
How did 7-0 become 7-7??? Poor editing again lol.
😁😊😎👊👍😚👌🤙💯!!
Kyler looks so annoying as a teammate whenever he gets mad. Compared to Russ who’s always positive
Seattle is playing much better defense.
Peterson has been getting burned by the hawks receivers this year. And that stick from Hyde was a nice way to finish him off
Respect to AZ for pulling out that W last week, but there was no way Wilson was going to have 2 bad games 🤷‍♂️.. no way..
Not a Cardinals fan and I don't think they will win a Superbowl this year but if anyone in the NFL right now deserves a Superbowl it's Larry Fitzgerald. He only played in one Superbowl and came up huge in the game but was snubbed at the end by the Steelers but I hope he ends up getting a ring while playing with the Cardinals before he retires.
Carlos Dunlap is awesome
Seahawk fans :  the spread is -3 and we only up by 2. Refs: I gotchu.. safety
Cardinals O- Line: We're supposed to protect who??
https://youtu.be/3ZyeIqez84M
As a bengals fan seeing Dunlap Make the game winning sack feels soooo good cause he is better in Seattle
The D line did really well tonight and put some pressure. Keep it up Hawks, LETS GO!!!
#FIREBengalsDC #DUNLAP
Nice too see Larry legend out there still
Anybody notice the fistbump at 4:10?
I just came to say, I know that I commented that the Cards would win this game. I was mistaken. Now laugh at me.
Refs have been real questionable this season
am i not the only one who saw locket fist bump the ref at 4:10
Not even a Cards (Cowboys, top five pick woooo) fan but please give Larry a ring.
I think too many fans don't realize how much of a team game football is. Quick to blame or exaggerate individuals. "The shits chess, not checkers"
Why do we need Jesus?   We are in a fallen world full of pain suffering, and wickedness, separated from God by sin. Then what must be done to restore fellowship with God? First we must be genuine about our own sins. Look at the 10 commandments and see how you stack up, it is a mirror showing us our sinful nature. God is perfectly holy and we have all broken his moral law and deserve his wrath and judgement.   The Gospel:   At the same time the Father is so rich in mercy and loves us so much that he sent his Son in the flesh 2000 years ago, who lived a sinless life on our behalf, was gruesomely tortured, nailed to the cross, and mocked by his own creation. He died a horrific death in place of US sinners, and rose from the dead 3 days later proving he is the Great I Am. He paid the fine for our death sentence on the cross thus satisfying the Father's justice and wrath, setting us free from sin and the Law. Once we realize our sinful nature,  we must repent for our sins, and put our full trust in the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ like you'd put faith in a parachute. Do this and you will be born again. All your sins will be washed away and He will give you the Holy Spirit, which will live in you. You'll have eternal life in a united heaven and earth, a new heart that loves righteousness, and relationship with God will be made right, not by our good works or observance of the law, but by his AMAZING GRACE and mercy. You will be a new creature in Christ, that is His promise. This is all a free gift from God.  Humble yourself and ask him to reveal himself to you. Think about this, if you have a Bible I invite you to read the book of John. Jesus loves you and he will never let you down. Peace.
No penalty called on the pass interference on Fitz. Would've won the game for the cards
defense stepped up big today for the hawks. not going lie thought russ would have had to put up 35 to win
Carlos Dunlap ended this one on a perfect note. Man's paying huge dividends!!!
Dre Kirkpatrick needs to get tf off this team. Gets cooked all game and can’t keep his temper.
Finally a satisfying win!
I'm a Steelers Fan, but I would love to see a 7 game series between these two teams.
This game crazy
just here for the comments
Did not expect Seattle to have scored 28 points that way...
Isaiah Simmons really popped off
not gonna lie refs kinda won this for Seattle
Everybody: mUrrAy iS tHe fASt GUy.  Until the play he needed to be running around on. Or at least looking.
They cheated for Seattle. Funny asf
Oof Cardinals shot themselves in the foot today
Man, I'm not a fan of either of these teams, but it certainly seems as though the refs were heavily favoring the Seahawks
Let’s be honest whoever did the lil cartoon on metcalf did a horrible job that do not look like him at all😂
Running game was sick no lie!!! GO HAWKS💚💙💚💙
Refs got they cars payed off
Should've lost to buffalo too. There overrated
9:10 thats how all rounds should end baby! With a real boom of pads i love this play
Yo hit like if ur high asf
Yes, some good defense and some good offense. And, a good balanced win. Nice to see the run back. (I love having Metcalf on the team.)
Cardinals with a history of choking since 1898.  They showed how to beat Murray.   Bust him in the mouth and he lays down like a little girl.  How did he think he was ever going to play QB in NFL and not get hit?   NFL is not the flag football of Big12.   The defense doesnt decide to blitz until 4th quarter.   How does a guy with  losing record at a P5 school and who coached Mahones get an NFL HC job?   Oh year Bidwill likes to hire guys cheap.   So he hires college guys or NFL assistants with no HC exp.
Cardinals: Mission failed will get em next time
NFC West is hands down the best division in football this year. We will probably have 3 teams in the playoffs. I'm gonna grab the popcorn and enjoy this race
THATS MY RUUUSS
Can the Seahawks just play every Divisional game in Prime Time now??
Arizona is actually doing really good this year
Cardinals: *gets penalized a lot* Seahawks: Wait we wanna try that too.  Also waiting for Chickers to come comment on my post about why Lamar is better than Kyler
Anyone else think both teams looks amateurish?!?! This was ugly
You have to admit, it’s fun watching these athletic QBs put it work. I hope we’re passed the days of fat and all Tom Brady-like QBs
This game ended with Murray getting sacked. SMH....  I bet Tua would have not let that happen to him.
Me with 2:30 left in the game. Ok we just need a TD and we are all good.  Carlos Hyde taking the butterfingers sponsorship: Are you sure about that?
Ever since the Seahawks picked up Carlos Dunlap the defense has improved big time
Metcalf seemed cool when he was getting drafted. Soon as he got some spotlight he became a major Dbag. Such a shame. (This isnt based on this fight, not sure who started it.)
Idk abt that call on Peterson right b4 the 2nd half  I’m a giants fan but cmon
I watched the highlights on the official nfl app. They didnt even show the metcalf PI penalty. That was like one of the most pivotal moments of the game!
Everybody hyped up Isiaiah Simmons like he was going to be a great linebacker. The dude is non-existent, BUST.
4:10 I don't think I've ever seen a player that scored a touchdown give knuckles to the ref like this before.
Did anyone else notice Buck and Aikman are as in love with Metcalf as Madden was with Farve? Metcalf is an electrifying game changer but it was funny how much they talked about him. How is no one talking about the comeback of Snacks ! Welcome back Snacks you have been missed.
SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide} https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lions+named+leo+ ...great  game///!!!
I think that is the first time I have seen a safety because the team can’t be back up any farther lmao 😂
The end was dumb seahawks touched larry fitzgeralds face mask and they dont do anythin about. Kyler throws to andy isabella (shouldve got a pass interference) and plus when kirkpatrick fought metcalf tried to swing too and they get 15 yard gain and 1st down
Good game Cardinals, honestly didn’t expect this win, the Cardinals played really good this game and we didn’t deserve the win. See y’all in the Playoffs.
Real MVP Wilson
4:10 the ref congrats lockett on the TD.
ALOT of pressure. Condolences.
My man DK about to tear that dude in half
Jesus is coming back and he is the only way to heaven, so to go you need to repent and have faith in him and with Jesus’ help we can do these things and be saved from evil. God bless and please take this seriously🙏❤️✝️
Kyler might be the most exciting player in the league currently
As a Hawks fan, we definitely got away with some terrible reffing tonight that benefited us. GG Cards. This is turning into a great rivalry.
I'm very happy the cards lost, im a bills fan and im still bitter 🙃
Murray needs to stop always looking for Hopkins. He ends up taking time waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting
Go Hawks!!! See what happens when y'all run the rock.
/
So we ain’t gonna mention the blind fucken reds
Russ’s power on the run is insane
They still have these two despicable Woke announcers working games???
Finally Russ didn’t let me down
Murray is a small, ugly looking guy but he’s still an ok football player.
Bruh how the O-Line of the Cardinals get so many false starts when there was no crowd...
Safety Was huge
Refs: What is this pass interference you speak of?
“Watch the screen” 3:20 lol
I’ve noticed that joe buck gets saying “Pass has been caught”
It was Obvious that the Sea Hawks had their own Referees, Hell the one even gave a Sea Hawk a Fist bump after the Sea Hawks got a touchdown.  There were plays that should have had Penalties on the Sea Hawks, but the same Ref would not call them.
Can we please address the Line and Run defense.
So the worst defense in the league shut down the best offense in the league?  Must be 2020 folks.  lol  GREAT WIN HAWKS!!
Sea chickens suck.
Refs: Hey Arizona how many penalties you guys want? Arizona: Yessssss!! Refs: Umm, ok, Hey Seattle how many injuries you guys want? Seattle: Yessssss!! Refs: Wtfff
GG CARDS #GoHawks
Hawks had a good game and bring back Dan Quinn for our defense.
You can't see it in the video, but I watched the end of this one and thought it was really cool to see a lot of cardinal players coming over and handshaking/hugs/congratulating Wilson. I appreciate good sportsmanship, good game Cardinals!
It's funny watching people say Russel WIlson is a MVP candidate. The dude is an average QB who has always gotten help from the Refs his whole career.
No hail Murray this time!
Patrick Peterson is so washed up mans constantly getting burned every game
Refs Vs Cardinals Shouldve been two pass interferences at the end of game but its whatever
That fumble by the goal line was the difference in this game
Not this time in our home turf cardinals
lack of experience cost the game
Kyler was hurt but GG Seattle
Russel Wilson still my MVP
ehh Seahawks fans have only been through like 20 heart attacks this year
Idk 50 seconds left, with a timeout, and repeated shots to the end zone from basically the 30? Seems like better plays could have been made
The ambient/fake crowd noise is super unnecessary.   If the stadium is quiet, then let it be. I'd much rather hear the players than some fake noise
here comes the bandwagons switching over to our hawks
Cardinals: Lose to Seahawks   Salty Dolphins Fans: Can we be higher than them on the power rankings now???
Ayudaron mucho a Seattle.
Primetime games in Seattle with no fans makes me feel so... unsatisfied.
Brother o lime for the cardinals was dog bro they could’ve won if they could protect kyler just a little
Hopkins get hit and asks for a penalty. DK gets hit and the linebacker goes down.
so many ips and they didn't even call em seahawks dont deserve there spot there to toxic
Ken Norton was tired of being pressed for 3 weeks straight.
The biggest difference is the 12th man which is not the fans but the referees I have seen them give so many games to Seattle over the last decade up there it's unreal remember that hail Mary in 2012 that was an interception that they gave the touchdown to Golden Tate on!
Now THIS is the Seattle Defense I like to see!
4:10 did the ref just dap/Fist bump Lockett? Lol
Nice ref ball
Cards WRs gave up nd o-line at the end
idk why people thought dk was overrated until I watched this game. and now I agree with the people that say dk is overrated. I know its just one game but he did not look good out there
So y’all just gonna skip cards first touchdown?
So proud of ma Hawks !!! 2 back to back miserable weeks, But defense showed up today... surprisingly starting off with a back to back 3 in out on Cardinals ! Knew the hawks wouldn’t lose 3 straight. Good game to Cardinals !
shows penalty, doesnt show Touchdown
Lets get into a fight on 4th down. Real smart AZ.
Dk felt the space jam aliens took his talent last week, he is reportedly happy to get his game back hahah
Soo is Seattles defense garbage or not....?
Seattle’s defense actually stepped up today. Was not expecting it but it is definitely welcome
How did espn give Wilson a 43 qbr? He had a 119 passer rating!!!
Seahawks is 3-0 with wearing action green on blue combo
Damn man hurts going down like this damnnnnnnn Gg seahawks
Literally I was watching this game on a livestream and the chat was filled with salty and toxic cardinals saying the Seahawks suck and other things   My only question is where are those salty cardinals at now 😂
I still think Russell should get mvp this year
If tre flowers played like this every game he’d be a probowler no doubt.
Fail Murray sadly
Too many self inflicted wounds by the Cards and the refs definitely didnt do them any favors. Their team is legit once they get more discipline. Dre Kirkpatrick deserves to get jumped in that locker room
3 guarantees in life  1. Bills  2. Taxes 3. The Seahawks going 1-1 against the cardinals
Name a better duo than the Seahawks and heart attacks        I'll wait
Gg cardinals
GG Seahawks. Y'all deserved it more than the cardinals. They didnt want it today, and it showed.
rofl The Cardinals beat the Seahawks then the Bills beat the Seahawks then the Cardinals beat the Bills then the Seahawks beat the Cardinals....if only the Bills played the Cardinals again and the Seahawks and Bills
Seahawks and Cardinals: How about this time we see who can get more flags this game?
Dude that Cardinals O Line is so trash wtf couldn't protect Murray to save there life
Can’t expect to go far in the playoffs if we keep losing the same ways over and over. Hopefully this mini bye gives the team time to ACTUALLY reflect on the loss. Many more games left, gg Seattle. #RiseUpRedSea
This rivalry is great and I’m a raiders fan😂
Pain.
highlights out FAST
never knew tre flowers was hopkins dad.      I guess you learn something new everyday
Workmanlike 2013-14 style win  Let Russ cook? Grinding is cooking too
Damn those refs are on some bull.
Gg
Seriously I wonder what the outcome of this game would have been without all those flags. There is no doubt that this game probably would have been a way different score if it wasn’t for all those flags.... Both teams Shot themselves in the foot...🦶🔫
To be honest this game was rigged like most nfl prime time games are the hawks was just the team goodell and the nfl wanted and vagas wanted
Rams winning NFC West overall  the Rams have Depth at almost every position and have Donald and ramsey locking down the D
This was a statement win if they keep playing like this they should be Super Bowl favorite
Huge Seahawks fan here, so much respect for Murray. The man is such an inspiration and plays so well
DK gotta stop getting in fights. Seems like every other game. I know he’s a great receiver but that stuff is counterproductive
7-3.
Sweet revenge now let’s return the favor to the rams.
The refs didn’t call flag when the defense made contact with Larry Fitzgerald???
GG Cards
Amazing Game, Ggs To the Cards, GO HAWKS💙💚💙💚💙💚
Seattle is undefeated in Lumen Field. I quickly got used to the new name.  Did you know that Seattle hasn't lost a game when wearing their action green unis?
Seattle has a chance to run the table with the easiest remaining schedule. Only opponents that are good are the rams and maybe 49ers
we just gonna ignore carlos hyde’s amazing performance
Wooooot! That’s my Seahawks! Thank you for making my week! Let’s keep it going! 💙💚💙💚💙💚💙💚💙💚💙💚
So many bandwagons in the comments russ is the mvp now but yall was cooking his behind the last two weeks. Smh if you got a pick stick with em till the end. I picked russel since the beginning.
Honestly they even teams but gg, but wait for next year the cardinals are looking really good
Ive gotta say, this is probably the best game of Flowers' career so far. The Cardinals have some good receivers even outside of DHop and he was fantastic
The Seahawks actually played defense tonight and Chef Wilson didn't cook any turnovers? Wonderful.  Onward to Philly!
Hey Carmelo Anthony you deleting comments??
Seahawks defense ending the game? Can't be. Looks like we slipped into an alternate universe where the defense can finish games.
3:20 "WATCH THE SCREEN" THAT HAD ME DYING 😂😂😂😂😂
See what I mean, Murray magic was a fluke! #billsmafia
First of all, well played to the Seahawks! I think they played a very good game overall. But holy cow, can we please talk about the Arizona penalties? Absolutely ridiculous! Did as much damage to themselves as Seattle did just about. Arizona is a young team and with Dhop and Murray the future looks bright but this game I think really showed off the lack of experience and discipline. The season of course is not over yet, but if Arizona wants to make a playoff run they have got to get some discipline in their ranks. I know Arizona has the number 1 ranked offense right now or at least is highly ranked, but I honestly think that is what held them back in this game. Penalties and even KK's play calling were just not on par.
As a bills fan. Thanks seahawks. This eases some of the pain.  We need to take note on how not to give up last second plays.....
Just happy that Isaiah Simmons is getting snaps and got his 1st sack!
Good job hwaks ! Yes , needed this one. 7-3 feels good.
Waiting for az fans to talk like u did after game one
As a cards fan: Cut Kirkpatrick, play calling was awful, too many penalties, bias refs, horrible protecting Murray, and Murray with a hurt shoulder not being able to match down the field.
Защита Seahawks выиграла в концовке матч? Да ещё и отзащищавшись против пасового нападения? Без флагов и глупых нарушений? Ну, вообще красаучеги) #GoHawks 🏈
Refs vs cardinals and I’m a Seahawks fan
Coming from a cardinals fan this game was beyond thrilling. Although there were parts I didn't agree with, Seattle still did an amazing job.
I’m not mad we can still make the playoffs
So much for the best dou in the league 😂
refs were terrible man everybody was off, just another thursday night...
Russell Wilson delivered the bounce back for Seattle. Kyler Murray tried to create Murray magic like he did last week, but the Seahawks rush defense was too much. Revenge is a dish best served cold!
I’m loving the contrast of these uniform colors.
The rushing game for Seattle really lifted all the weight off Wilson’s shoulder
The Cardinals didn’t lose to the Seahawks      The Cardinals lost to the penalties
I won some money on Seattle tonight
Rise up red sea! We still in this. We ain't going down with out a fight. We go down, the whole NFC west is going down with us!. AZ love 😊
Let’s go Hawks!! Mad defensive improvement. And Russ back in form
8:40 How many people did he juke or break tackles from
Go hawks
What i thought Cardinals is a good team, why td they lost to my bad team Seahawks?😅.. oh won the 1at meet of the season and they think they're a good team? Haha that's why the good team like them missed playoffs off 4, 5 years straight 😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🖕
These refs need to be fired immediately. Absolutely one of the worst officiated games I’ve ever seen on both sides. Plus I think they even stopped the game at one point just to say that the time on the clock is right.
DK and Lockett both top 5 WRs in the league
The fact that flowers played well surprised me alot. Hopefully he keeps improving
Russel wilson and the seahawks are back!!!
Ravens fan here. I was rooting for Seattle to win. This was a good game all around. Now the Seahawks next games will be smooth sailing until the end of the season 🏄 they have the NFC East 😃😂🤣 it doesn’t get any easier than that 🎲
Thanks defense, you actually balled out. Ken Norton lives to coach another day. BUT STOP CALLING PREDICTABLE BLITZES! GOHAWKS!
We need defense like this all the time
Cardinals back down to earth after that fluke ass win last week🤣🤣🤣. Thank you Seahawks.
Best Thursday night game of the year so far
the hawks defense really stepped up today. gg to the hawks
Pererson been getting COOKED lately
💙💚GG
LET'S GO HAWKS!! WE'RE WINNING THE SUPER BOWL
I swear this was the most unfair game I have ever seen
Dunlap is a nice piece, the Bengals are such losers for letting him go, they don’t start john Ross or billy price either. The bengals would lose to Bama if they played.
These teams are so good the Texans are asking if either of them want Watson or Watt for free
now this is TNF
Don't forget to hit that like  It help this  channel with YouTube Algorithm Thank's
I hate when Russ has a couple of bad games.. they say he not mvp no more then this happens.
The defense actually made stops if we play like this again and again i see a super bowl
Dhop got clamped I said what I said
Good the Seahawks win
Feels nice seeing our most recent trade acquisition sealing the game for us.
Imagine getting clamped by trey flowers 😐
i dont think wilson should be MVP. he had 3 bad games in a row and this one was ehh ok.
Was Steve keim drunk when he hired kliff  kingsbury
My prediction was wrong
Ig tre saw the insults and took them personally💀
The RT at the end had one job lol
212th
Bruh
In Lemen We Boomin
Cardinals defense needs to continue to develop
At this point I’d be surprised if the cards went 12-4 four like all of the hype prod fanboys said before the season. Could be wrong though, they might run the table🤷‍♂️
Props to the Seattle defense. They got the Seahawks a big W despite having Wilson as quarterback
Arizona player: WATCH THE SCREEN Seattle: Ya even if you say that we will still get 10 yards
MVP Russ
Hopkin "so called best wr" trey flowers locks up      Trey Flowers= best cb in the league
Refs vs cardinals
RAMS WINNING THE DIVISION
ENORMOUS win for the Hawks! 💙💚
Fact Murray is small
It is really time to get rid of Patrick Peterson
Yo the cardinals are so unappreciated they have so many thing affected them Isaiah Simmons being a bust (so far) chandler Jones out ,and yet they continue to win games and do very good, give them some credit
If the  Seahawks defense plays like this all season they could make it to the super bowl
What a game! #GoHawks
Good way to bounce back for the hawks!!
When our defense actually shows up 🙏🙏
JEZZY n GUCCI MANE SQUASHED the BEEF 🏳🇺🇲2020
0:40 I have never heard joe buck show this much excitement
Ref to DK: ur ejected for fighting DK: Sorry, what? Ref: taunting, number 20 of the defense
Now if the defense can just maintain this performance, then maybe we can make a deep playoff run. Dont need the defense to be elite, they just gotta be decent.
Cards really aren’t that good. A lucky Hail Mary away from 5-5
Why the hell didn’t they Throw it to Hopkins? Dude just caught the best Hail Mary ever
Please give the nfc playoffs spot to the nfc west.
Lamar Jackson, Kyler Murray, and Russell Wilson are the embodiment on why the mobile QB will never succeed in the NFL.
CARDINALS got cheated by refs
This game was so fun to watch
LETS GO SEAHAWKS WIN
SUPER BOWL 43 RUNNER-UP ARIZONA CARDINALS HEARTBROKEN IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
As a Cardinals fan we were sloppy, all these penalties finally caught up to us. I think we win with a field goal at the end if we didn't get that holding safety and the 'taunting'  call that lead to a TD. We will most likely make the playoffs, but won't make it far if we don't clean up our act.
How did the seahawks get 160 rushing yards. Idk. But I'm happy with it
Ya think Seahawks could win the Súper bowl?
Honestly, the biggest surprise of this game is Seattle's defense. They played well enough to not let this go to overtime, but still a great game.
Is Russ still in the MVP debate?  Like: Yes Comment: No
Refs were garbage on both sides Missed calls and calls that shouldn't have been calls
DEFENSE SHOWED UP! THERE'S THE SEAHAWKS I KNOW AND LOVE!
Lowkey cardinals only lost because of number 20 penalty
Well Done Seattle Seahawks Russell Wilson save the day with the victory at home against the Arizona Cardinals in so happy Go Hawks 💙💚💙💚💙💙🏈🏈🏈🇺🇸🇺🇸
Yhu can see da dedication my boy Russell had tonight!!💚💙
Refs killed the Cardinals all game, such bullshit
tre flowers mvp
The number 32 defense gave up only 21 points to the number 1 offense. 😳😳😳😳😳
Ngl people really using penalties as a excuse is dumb considering the seahawks had just as many if not more if you watched the game the seahawks dominated on both sides almost all game
Revenge taste so sweet doesn't it
GOO HAWKS
Kyler Murray almost tied up the game, but the Seahawks defense said, No Sir!!!
seahawks finally got a new defensive coordinator or i’m jus trippin cuz ian seen that type of defense all seeson
This division is going to be the best in the league for years to come. So pumped!
How is it WEEK 11 already? WTF ... where did time go?
Not a touchdown, nor a field goal, but a sack! A sack wins the game!
They were saying good things about the Cardinals O-Line... *the next play Kyler was sacked on 4th Down* . Announcers really be jinxing things huh😂
Seahawks 5-0 in action green now. 💚💚 I love you Seahawks.
1 like = prayer for Olsens speedy recovery
i’m liking this new defensive coordinator for the hawks
Unfortunately, no hail murray this time. 😞😞😞
anybody hate the new youtube comment activity or is it just me?
Wow I'm early no hate please
No one:   Cardinals O-line: ight imma head out
good game tre flowers played well
Seahawks are officially undefeated at Lumen Field
Am I the only here who's confused about why Arizona kept going for deep passes towards the end? I feel like they completely blew that final drive...
Dre Kirkpatrick, you had ONE job to do on third down and you pull an Antonio Brown.
Russ didn't turn it over, they had a run game, d stepped up. Seattle needed that bad.
Dre Kirkpatrick hurt his team with his stupidity and getting a 15-yard penalty that kept the Seahawks drive alive
Damn bro I’m a Seahawks fan but Larry deserves a super bowl ring! I really hope he don’t retire without one.
Russell: Feels good not to play the Rams
Please let us get a part 3 of this matchup during the playoffs!!
Deandre Hopkins: The only guy to moss 3 pro bowlers and get shutdown by the worst secondary
Finally our defense is starting to show up. GG Cardinals.
Everyone is still going to say the week 7 game was better just bc it went into overtime
Oh! Would you look at that, the Seahawks finally remembered what a Defense is, good for them 👏
Seattle didn't win the game  Arizona lost it
Definitely the best Thursday Night game of the year
Seahawks: How are we going to win today?  Cardinals: Penalties Seahawks: How many?  Cardinals: Yes
READY FOR RIVALS WEEK!!!
Russ is cooking again
Fun fact: Russel would have a total of 34 tds and 6 int if his receivers caught the ball. Or if pass interferences were called.
That was a very good divisional game.
The falcons are gonna make a huge come back believe me
Penalty Bowl
None of the teams pictured here will win their division
Seahawks: Inter!  Cardinals: AS Roma!
Back on top! Let’s go Hawks!!!
This battle is gonna be amazing for years to come
Amazing game by the defense, if they keep on playing like this, they are going to be contenders.
I was the first
When Russell has a run game, he's pretty much perfect. The defense stepped up big too. GG Arizona. See yall in the playoffs
Another heart attack game
People: russ is a turnover machine lol he is trash.   Seahawks: *gives russel a running game*   *russel stats perfect*
This win over the Cardinals means nothing. Russell still has played himself out of the MVP race and already proved that Rodgers and Mahomes are still better than him. Come playoffs, Seattle's defense will be the reason why they won't reach the NFCCG.
You little red birds would be 5-5 without that miracle play. Now relax your chirpers before your moments of happy feasting turn into a slaughter house like with the rest of my fallen brothers and sisters.
Imagine missing 2 pi calls at the end😂😂😂😂 gg though it’s ok though I see they forgot to wear their glasses
What a game! The NFC West are the powerhouse division in the league!!!!
Yooohoo
Seahawks here first W
Go hawks💚💙
Seahawks defense really stepped up tonight, that's why the Seahawks won. #GOHAWKS
Russel Wilson has to be the most humble man in the NFL
*Dre Kirkpatrick throws a swing*  Metcalf: so you’ve chosen death  Referee: 15 yard penalty automatic 1st down
Toddler vs Toddler shootout
Good game
Hope this one is as good as the last
this game was crazy
Finally thank you nfl
First?
