Mason must speak to the fans. He needs to be contrite, apologize, and ask for forgiveness. Fans will respond and give him a 2nd chance.
16:45 for our children's children
Hopefully We become an oil club
Jim is uniteds public enemy no2.
Greedy Glazers
We’re not back on this qater bs are we??
Glazers are greedy they don't care about Manchester or the club they only see 💰signs
The whole deal with SJG is rotten and stinks
Glazers broke this clubs passion to fill there pockets
Only owners like the Glazers wld mk a transfer like Harry Kane same like Harry Maguire
Sir Jim Ratcliff buying United is a big step BACKWARDS!
Qatar ❤❤❤❤❤ outbid Ratcliff pls!
I back u Mark fr Qatar 100% full sale!
I stand for Qatar 100% takeover
It seems to me that as Mason is not guilty in the eyes of the law, he shouldn't be punished by us all. I'm not saying he is innocent but he is in the eyes of the law. The 'evidence' we saw and heard is circumstantial. Imagine that he is innocent and he is having his life ruined despite that. It would maybe have been different if he had his day in court and found innocent. There will always be doubt about him as it stands. Mud sticks.
Super super league on the way 🤔
The Glazers will stay and will opt for minority investments.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The core dron thermometer?
Mason needs to play  and win games at Trafford ryt nw.
I'm not liking Sir Jim's intentions
RATCLIFFE AS MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER IS NOT GOOD….!! HE WILL GET ‘CUCKED’ BY THE GLAZERS……
The Rat made a bigger offer and willing to keep the Glazers on board
If Maguire is talking about respect and not being respected then he should take a good look in the mirror and he should have the respect for the club to realize he’s a disgrace and that he’s not worthy enough to wear the clubs colors as well as captains armband and get out of the club!
One thing I love about Goldbridge is the fact he calls out these double standard pundits
Glazers out , Maguire at Blackpool 😂
Can we get James Ward Prowse? Someone that got lot of fitness and not prone injury
GLAZERS OWT SHIEKH JASSIM IN SIMPLE ⚽️
So Jims bid is higher.. Yeah we are doomed forever.
In a weird way SJR is actually worse then just the glazers because he will be bringing more debt and owns Nice which could mess up our spots in Europe
Not looking good tho is it..?
How long is he going to milk hhix this for content for?Everybody knows nothing is going to happen before the end of the seaon
WE NEED TO STOP TOMORROWS GAME GOING AHEAD SNEAKY RATCLIFFE LOWER THAN A SNAKES BELLY
Two plus two is four Minus one that's three, quick maths😂😂
It all comes down to how much SJR will pay the Glazers who want to leave vs how much Al thani pays for the whole club.
Its just too bad that its not the fans who choose who buys the club
Glazers Out ! Sir Rat out !
It’s over if Sir Jim bid is accepted
bring back mason
Sir Jim bid will win.
F**k the Glazers! Glazers out!
⚠️⚠️It is reported Ratcliffe has taken the Pole position in the Manchester United buying race after valuing the club over £5bn. The Glazzers are cooking something bad...
Gary Neville is a Champagne- communist.
Full sale
Maguire has become  another Glazer for us FFS he should really get out of our club just like the Glazers
🔥FACT🔥 Some Newcastle fans have been excusing & defending saudi royal mafia’s atrocities as a part of defending their team. 😒
I am not disgusted by Newcastle & City fans being happy of getting ultra rich regimes, but I am so disgusted when I hear some of them for considering excusing & defending the saudi royal mafia atrocities as a part of defending their teams. 😮‍💨
Qater is the best bid for the club. But the glazers don't care what's best for United so what's the relevance of what is pledged beyond what they get? Relevant to the Chelsea takeover based on the premise that the seller cared, which the glazers don't. Unless I'm missing something?
Glazers out!!
5 billions is a disrespect to millions childrens that are dying in some countries witouth food and watter
I don’t understand how Mark’s head still fits in that studio. Maybe it’s camera tricks.
Mark, you’re such a f***ing hypocrite saying that “Are we selling our soul to Qatar?” is a valid question, and then saying it’s a question worth asking AFTER they’ve bought the club?  Yeah, heaven forbid you bring up a tough question BEFORE it’s a moot point. That’s embarrassing coming from you, or should be.
Man City buy-back clause for Lavia only active in 2024, we're good for this summer to buy him
❤
Don't want Qatar really but to compete with City we need Qatar.
Glazer family.. greedy..
Yes, we are selling our soul. But we need to compete with Newcastle and City.
How come ppl who are against Qatar won't speak what these "human rights" issues are? Cowards. How come it doesn't affect man city, Newcastle, PSG?
Whos fault is it that where selling our soul thats all on Glazers, if they run the Club prperly we wuodnt have this problem. Glazers OUT
I’ve got a question what when and where would you want the new ground to be
It’s simple & clear, even clearer now ,complete sale only, it has to be sheik Jaz, if we want to compete again & nock City of their perch, simple
Manchester United needs Aston villa Ollie Watkins to support Marcus Rashford on the attack
I still can't get over Adam asking that Maguire question 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
Jim Radcliffe has already lost the fans . Maguire needs to go back to his creche to learn basics and how to use something called brain which is between his ears. But I know it's tough for him because he doesn't know how to use it. Such a junk, just sell him off!!
I need a love button for some of this content @Youtube
Qatari bid goes through get rid of deadwood, even if they offer small fees, build a new young squad, buy the best players under 25.
Sir Jim you
i am worried that this bid from sir jim was planned with him an the glazers
United lost their soul when the Glaziers bought them. An owner that's not bleeding them dry can only be a positive.
Mark what sir Jim bet is fantastic business wise to me its attractive offer for the sealer. But am still want Jasmine to take over period.!!!!
I've said 1000 times. Man utd has a British culture problem. Glazers are Americans. Different culture. You British ppl skim are issues. You don't say things head. You're cowards. I've asked many times what isues regarding Qatar some of you don't want. All i get is silence. Who is this Jim fella anyway?
Glazer out.
Maybe ten Haag doesn’t wanna betray reality
Can you not swear till after 7 as I listen with my boy around and the Mrs looks over everytime you swear 😂
SAF said it all comes down to ability and Slabby Maguire doesn’t have that or the mentality to captain the side . The Hag isn’t going to protect him like a favourite son the way ole or Southgate does and that’s good
An Al Thani win is a win for Sports Washing, anti-LGBTQi+, covering up the deaths of migrant workers and women being treated as second class citizens. Also lets UK Government off the hook for investing in their own cities. Qatar is uying the Tories and the UK.
Glazers r safer taking what is offered for they will never get over 5 billion again for the club I think realistically they will take it unless there absolutely stupid !!!! It’s time there gone clowns 🤡
Why do we want to become another Man City, the reason I hate Man City is because they can just buy the league. I like being the underdog against the oil clubs that buy the leagues.
Isn't Mark taking this Gary snub a bit too personally?
Well the best news is Maguire opened his mouth again. You know what happens to players who openly disrespect the manager. Ask Ronaldo. 😂
Qatar really wants this sport washing deal. At all costs.
yes to Al Thani
Andy Goldstein is a muppet and a wasteman who us jealous of Mark Goldbridge
It makes more sense for Glazers to accept Qatar's bid. But it's Manchester United, notthing makes sense here.
Get Andy on your  show. Let him own  up  to his comment.
This man LOVES man united just like us pls rescue us
If we dont want super wealth we dont want to compete simple as that
Wonder would ajax do a swap deal and cash for timber with big head maguire going to ajax
The glazers reaaaaaalllyyyyyy pissing me off
Maguire is a fool
Maguire is a fool
I thought they were holding out for 6 billion? Also I don’t think in Uniteds case Qatar is a cheat code, it just allows the club to tap in to what they already were being the highest revenue generator, Glazers just wouldn’t let them. It’s not like being a club that previously weren’t even on the map.
Joel is worth $1bn  he gets $1.17bn for his shares so more than doubles his worth  Al thani is paying £5.6bn which is $7.1bn  then hes buying the shares afterward from the likes of linsdell , senvest , marathon etc in a seperate bid  Clear debt , pay for all transfer instalments up front and pay for stadium and training ground upgrade
the grazers are greedy. there is no thing as "enough."  That's why they will rot in hell.
Plot twist - 4th round of bids, deadline 12 May. 😂
Running a football club is key 🔑 no matter what the bid record is … good luck 🤞
I dont know why people still listening to Gary Neveille
Mark, if the Glazers don't take the 5 million plus, then the Man U fans should make then regret they stay, enough said.
Football sold it's soul when they signed a deal with Sky. This absolute garbage of the club selling it's soul is laughable.
You keep doing what you're doing Goldie. Nobody will remember the likes of Goldstein inna few years.
IAM NOT GOING TO SLEEP GOOD AT "  THE DAY WHEN THIS CANCER  GLAZERS  FINISH AND THEY LEAVE WITHOUT SEE HIM BAD FACES OF ZOMBIE EGAIN IN MANCHESTER "
Come on Qatar just pay the 6billion and kick the glazers into space
What an arsenal title win means to Man Utd fans from the south of England and from Nigeria and South Africa is more painful than a Man City win 😂in those parts the arsenal rivalry carried over from arsenal wenger days means more than the local rivalry in Manchester. Man Utd means different things to different fans in different parts
FULL SALE
Good time for glazers to get lost.
World record bid considering it is a club with immense debt and crippled infrastructure
what else the glazers want. just get out.
Really hope Qutar don’t buy our club 😢
Mark spot on on everything here.  It is ok for Saudi Arabia to own Newcastle, Abu Dabi to own Man City and Qatar to own PSG but is not Ok to own ManUtd.Double Standards.
Thumbnail looks like a star wars poster 😂
Did Mark just quoted Manic Street Preachers?
Did you know about the Class B and the Class A shares that the Glaziers own?
Just a reminder that the summer window this year opens on July 1st
Don't you mugs get it 🙄 Why does anyone buy something for more than it's worth 🤷🏼‍♂️ welcome to the Euro league and playing all around the World, and not my Mancunian Old Trafford 😡
I bet it does not happen, no point getting excited x
A DEFINITELY NO to Double headed snake deal.
Full scale glazes out
Yiippppee do rey
Sir Jim and Glazers are no good for a club this size, Qatari are because they want to just invest. Offtopic does anyone know where to buy authentic United kits from like 98, 08 home and 92 away?
it looks like the Ovelap and gary neville beliives in cancel culture, since the wont have mark on the channel because he calls gary out.
You guys are delusional blazers ain't gonna sell
Anyone who does not want Qatari bid due to moral issues does not have the best interest of the Manchester United at heart. I do not see Man City, PSG and Newcastle fans or their former players being concerned about the morality involving their owners. It is now or never, it is our golden chance that we might never be able to get in the decades to come should we miss it now.
Everyone is saying  world record bid is gone in but nothing is been done yet is another waiting game like allway I'm getting sick of it now 🤬🤬
As fans we have no control on who buys our club. We are at the mercy of the Glazers. This is the bottom line and we have to accept the outcome, whatever way it goes
I wish the best for Mason ,i am so angry that woman's started to dictate football! What Mason did was not on the fkin field, was in his private life , he is not the only one and will not be the las one that did that
Honest question  If the glazers choose the right ceo and manager after sir Alex and spent the £1b wisely like city had would everyone still want the glazers to go?
The Glaziers are holding Man United to ransom and they will change their minds and ask for 7 billion
Sir Jim bid is lacklustre and Delusional
We will see, but I struggle to see any new buyer will spend as much on players as the Glazers. Their problem was they neglected the rest of the club.  But I think if people are expecting more in terms of playing staff, I can't see it.
'World Record' bid is just hype. Dallas Cowboys or New York Yankees would go for more if they were ever on the market. I do wonder how much the Glazers value their Tampa Bay Buccaneers though.
Isn't Jim's bid also a world record?
Glazers out
There’s something fishy going on with the Sir Jim bid
This is  world record bid what are you waiting for glezer out
The Glazers will not accept this bid.
I don't see any reason for the Glazers not to  accept the Qatar bid. Let's hope the deal can be wrapped up quickly so that everything will be in place for ETH to plan ahead for the new season.  Am not surprised by the statement of Jurriën Timber as he was one of the first name ten Hag wanted to bring over and I'm looking forward to getting more quality signings which we badly needed. Mark is right - we need the financial power of Sheikh Jassim to challenge at the very top.
5bn was already offered and declined
I'm happy Al Thani has called it a "take it or leave it offer" we can't keep playing by glazers rules
once Glazers are gone i will start back buying merchandise. The new owners will get a commercial goodwill bounce from fans ...
Kick glazer to the hell
Maguire is a snobhead..... If he was just open to critism he would have been a great player
Mark, we fans come here for the HARD TRUTH. ❤ from Ghana
The Glazers won't give a fiddler's pluck about clearing the debt or investing in infrastructure in the future.  All they want is hard cash.
I thought United were going to win the treble 😂😂😂.  Thanks for wanting us to win the league this year over Arsenal. We are going to beat your record and also show how insignificant UTD are compared to City.  Manchester is 🔵🔵🔵
Sooner or later this saga will end, too I'm so tired of it - time is running out for glazers
Massive massive next few days/weeks
Glazers out!! Sheikh Jassim In🇶🇦
I’ll say this about maguire , he has No skills but he has balls saying he wants respect , he’s not going to get it though because he’s done nothing to deserve it …
I find it hard to believe that some So called UNITED fans are Ok with this part of the world owning our English club?
If they know whats the best for them they should accept the Qatar bid, if they dont things are gonna get toxic af.
Adam still getting pelters for the Maguire question 😂😂
Glazers need to end on a good note ,I will forget all 20 years and forgive them if they sell it to 🇶🇦
Well said during the 26mins mark..
Mark is definitely still hurt that Gary Neville is not inviting him on overlap. He has done incredible job on United Stand, but slagging people off and making them feel stupid on social media is not the way to come on their show. Nobody ask you to agree with them but agree kindly, maturely and progressively, not condescending and insulting.
Yes Mark!!! Can't wait for your show tonight
Maguire is a human trash the same as Glazers
Fact is we don’t even need a cheat code, we just need rid of leeches and debt, we will be self funding if allowed
Plz sell u ain't gonna get a better bid than this they wiping a billion off aswell   like Mark said where gonna have to pay God knows how many billions to sort the mess out
I really hope that the British government taxes the Glazers for the sale of the club. It's something that isnt being discussed. When they go, i hope they get that curve ball 😏
it is basically 6 billion bid if he is paying off the debt
Because people in media will lose there jobs if they have a certain point of view, just like matt le tissier
Putting the bid into perspective, it works out at £136,986 EACH DAY FOR 100 YEARS 🙀
Greedy Glazer's.  Get out of our club you parasites.
$6b was always a joke. The club was valued on its earnings and it was worth less than 2b wasn't it?
I just emailed Joel Glazer and spoke my mind politely
Empty the stadium make them leave
Qatar human rights record ,slavery ,women's rights  given Manchester's connection to cotton trades slavery hope the Glazer's stay in a minority role.Qatar white washing their horrific regime
We need the qatars badly, to have any chance to keep pace, and get this club back up there alot faster.   Oh please let it happen ha
If he bid 5 and bit billion it’s 6billion by the time he clears the loans
Good luck to you guys at OT tomorrow, Glazers out is all I want
Nope. They knw our legacy so frightened. Look at how we perform with the bare minimum. Imagine when we have super wealth.
The glazers got no other option than accept the bid of Qatar.. Simple as.. If they don't then it will become very toxic & nasty...  In regards to sir Jim Radcliffe offer he just ain't suitable as only a majority stake he wants to buy which will still allow the glazers to still own a minority plus still in debt..
Mark that is why this United Stand is the best show on earth because you keep it real you don't suck up to no one and that's why your the best.
How can we be happy with Qatar hopefully taking us over and not give Mason another chance, it's fucking hypocritical 100%, a lot of fans are so fickle it's unbelievable, I cannot believe it.
If i was selling something and i get a world record bid i would say yes on the first second of the bid
Excellent show Mark
What we need to understand is that this entire sale is a ruse. They know no one bids £6bn - that's actually why they floated that figure.  This is clearly the illusion of a sale, of which the resultant non sale facilitates a part-sale and the Glazers remaining involved.  If they wanted to sell, it would be done by now. Look at the UFC, WWE, Chelsea etc. It shouldn't take this long because every keen seller knows what a decent offer looks like and takes it. All we have seen from the Glazers is procrastination..
Goldstein doesn't get it just because you call people out doesn't mean you don't like them. Goldstein is a rubbish presenter anyway
Anything short of an empty Old Trafford/(away attendance only) and disrupted games and sponsors OR Burning OT to the ground will rid us of these Glazer twatts
The glazer,s must be half idiot,s to refuse 5 billion glazer,s out
It’s a shame the Utd v Villa game is not being televised so people can see the protests! Glazers out!
When you were doing maths and said " no no no no" you sounded like Alfie Solomons 😂
when you are buying something , you buy it all or nothing , why would you share a such a monster of a club with someone like Glazers 😅😅😂.Manchester United is like a lion , you just need to wake it up , a beast of a club
JIM SNAKECLIFF.
I think the 5b is for the galzers and the other holdings are owned by Bank of America… which the former CEO is also the CEO of the 92 foundation now…
5bn GBP is 6.2bn USD. They get 1bn USD each, they’d be total fools to turn this down! Glazers out!
Goldbridge, man on the people.
They should put it to a fans vote
Maguire think he’s not respected enough?? Respect is earned 😂
Going to OT for the tour today before the match tomorrow.. hopefully see something about the takeover today 🙏
One of the biggest summers of our history is coming
Cmon jim buy them
I hope the Glaziers do get filled in. Twats
Harry Maguire...the odersity
Today I feel Qatari🤑🤑 💶
Remove adidas glazer will sale United in a few days 😂😂😂😂😂😂
When will we know what bid has been accepted?
£5billion and £1billion debt. Its already £6billion. Even their old poops will be cleared. What more do the Glazers wants??
Qatar all the way, it’s what’s best for the club, fans and local community. It will uplift us all.
If inoes are buying 50% what are they offering for that ? its important
Rapewood should never play in the Premier league ever again, let alone for Man Utd
The fact its a record fee ,any messing now, god sake 😒 only one  way the glazers can do to right all there wrongs and that's give the club a chance to be dept free with a full sale 😉
Goldstein works fr club and won't upset them. Neville moaned abt Qatar then him and his pal becks got nice little earner from them during world cup. Get rid of Glazers  Nev wants Sir Jim not Qatari but now quiet since glazers might stay with Sir Jim a Chelsea season ticket holder for last 30 years don't forget. Raine Usa Glazers Usa Sir Jim getting investment from JP Morgan Usa total carve up and that's what will happen and more debt.
Take a seat Pratcliffe!
Kick the fans who try it with him put the racism tag on them fans ohh its stephan
Its been reported that the Qatar bid gives the siblings 200-300 million each more than Jims bid. This is why the Qatar bid will be accepted, why would they take less just to let their brothers stay in power.
Glaziers out now
Wait till the summer fpr mason
4.77 BN ? world record yeah .. but i have to wonder i think Ineos bid is probably oddly valuing the club higher and thats the worry
World record bid, world record bid...what's the bid really? No one really knows! 🤷🏼 Imo this sale is a joke. Idc anymore! I will wait for the sale to go through. If sale isn't done. We wreck havoc on their asses period!
Louder at the start of this video that when Utd score 😆
Hola 6:16
Glazers need to be put in Quarantine on Mars !!!
Glazers be stupid to turn down this bid. Once they miss out on Qatar, they will never get anything near 5B for the club again
Great show Mark
Can someone explain the term ‘opportunity cost’ to Mr. Al Thani. It’s all well and good you won’t overpay but if let Sir Jim outbid you then you don’t truly care about United.
If Qatari wins the bid.  I want half or more of the players, staff, anything from last season or past *BEGONE*  NEW ERA AND A CLEAN BLANK SLATE.
Pttp at his best 😊
GLAZERS OUTTTTT 🎉🎉🎉🎉🔰🔰🔰
Ez 😌
Glazers just need to go give us what we want A Qatari Manchester United
Good show Mark
Hello 👋
Bonjour 👋
FULL SALE !
