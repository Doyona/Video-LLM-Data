Thank you for posting! Looking for help: My OKX wallet contains some Tether, and I have the  seedphrase: -clean- -party- -soccer- -advance- -audit- -clean- -evil- -finish -tonight- -involve- -whip- -action-. Could you suggest how should I proceed with transferring them to Coinbase Exchange?
TakeOff bes verse🙌🏿🙆🏿‍♀️🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
In hindsight, dis legend
"just puts us up there with the greats, that's it" - u gotta love takeoff❤
The baby of the Migos Rocket 💕
We miss all Take Off lives through you
🥰
2025??
What a waste, the definition of synergy.    None of the parts could be what the group was.   They fit perfect.  They don’t deliver hip hop classics like a Nas or a Kendrick, but they keep the party spinnin, and the music hit.
2025 anyone?
RIP Take😢
Takeoff passing that scissor  to Quavo is a real goated brotherhood🥺🥺....continue resting easy Take🕊
Demon Takeoff🙏🏿🔥

2025 Still Knocking This #RipTakeoff
I pray my boys go down in the hall of fame. I must be honest when I first listen to them I wasn't feeling them but I think I wasn't trying to give them a chance because they were from the young generation but then I started just playing them. I know just abt every song and the words. It"s forsure music .These guys need to go down in the hall of fame. They were in there on lane. Their music is not just music but art. They paid homage to a lot of our history plus we got to get to know them through there music and what they liked as young guys. They actually  have a lot of old school in them because things reminded me of my childhood and I grew up in the 90's. The group became 1 of my favorite groups in the whole wide world. 1st when the guys broke up that hurt me soooo bad, then they took Take I was hurt and believe it or not I'm still grieving him like he's kin to me. These guys are authentic and grew to become one of the best and creative rap groups that will ever ever grace this earth.  IDC what nobody says. ❤❤❤ R.I.P. 🚀
Show me better flow than this one
Takeoffs a legend 🙏

I still believe that Quavo is involved with the "Rockets" death. Take definitely would of surpassed him famously wise and he competed with him to much. Take was a natural when Quavo wasn't and just a grinder. The jealousy was always there all his life.
Master piece

I say it doesn't matter how rich or how famous you are look how so many of these young rappers done lost their life Tupac 25 Biggie 24 Aaliyah 22 Lisa 30 X 20  juice wrld 20  bankroll fresh 28  and now take off 28  Selena was 23  just to name a few I know there's a lot more but this music world is dangerous you sign a contract you make a lot of money for what for somebody on the street to get jealous and shoot and in your life it's not about the women's and the drugs what these young rappers need to do is try to get their life right with Jesus because you can rap you can make all the money in the world but if you is not safe and if you don't have a relationship with Jesus and you die in your sin been pretty much you going to die and go to hell because you trying to stay up all of your chargers on this Earth and this Earth is not our home we just put on this Earth for a short time to read the Bible and to love Jesus and what he had done for us of course the devil shows us a good time but you see the end result of all of those young R&B rappers or whatever Congress you see the end result when you choose and you go down the wrong road this is what happened to you you can be a good person and still die you can just be yourself and somebody just come and kill you just because they mad at the world this life is short people need to get to know Jesus before it's too late because the devil can show you a good time but it's not what people think it is the sex the drugs the naked womens the porn hat stuff is not I understand people make music to support their family to support their business but when you in this type of world your business will get exposed everybody will know what type of person you are doesn't matter if you are NFL player NBA politicians when you make one mistake every newspaper in every news will let the world know behind closed doors that's why people need to have a relationship with Jesus Christ God wants to give you eternal life the devil wants to give you a good time with heartaches and suffering and more sin God doesn't want you to live like that people choose to go to hell is not that God don't send people to hell people choose to go by the lifestyle that they live and what type of life that they chose inside that take off lost his life but you know this the environment that they open their self up to there are some rappers that are still alive but they was very cautious I guess the  other rappers wasn't hanging out and partying I'm pretty sure they was having a good time but they knew when to stop because they know that there are some haters out there was  going to kill them take off is not going to be the only rapper that's going to end up getting shot and gun violence the next rapper you hear is no surprise it's just a next rapper just waiting on his time to go to the graveyard and leave a single mother raising the kids because of their dad decisions kids is going to be fatherless it's a dirty World out here I don't know if takeoff even had a chance to have children sometimes you just got to not go out and have a good time but to relax at the house especially you one of the most popular rappers of all time you know there's somebody just waiting to take people out and unfortunately take off was the next victim of this sinful rap game but like I said he's not the only one I'm just going to sit here and see who's the next famous rapper R&B is going to be the next victim of somebody's gun
💖💖😍😍😍😍😍❣❣❣❣

Still don't feel real! That should have never happened!
Legendary, timelines track 👣🙌🏿🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊📢📢📢📣📣📣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish they were still together #r.i.p take off 🕊
Takeoff was so into the music! He knew everyone verse! So talented! Gone to soon🚀❤😢
I see why they ain't promote this album because it represents the black culture/community in a better light than the previous albums. You can tell they were trying to promote a different message.
RIP. Takeoff😞💔🙏🏿
People are saying Quavo sacrificed Takeoff to build his status. They don't know Quavo is next. They are both sacrifices.... To the dying Sun. There are things going on that the "little people" don't know. But you all will know soon. Soul Solar Soul Solar. The sun is dying people. And "stars" have been made, built up and then sacrificed to fuel the sun in an effort to slow it's inevitable and arduous death. If you think that's unbelievable peep this; the most unbelievable thing is they know and accept that they are a sacrifice. That's why they wear the socalled Jesus piece. Jesus was a knowing sacrifice. He knew he would be a sacrifice for the world. Look at Biggie's READY TO DIE and Pac's last album cover. These people know something that y'all don't! This comment may get ridiculed, because we are stupid! Peace
R.I.P Big Flow TAKEOff!
SENDING LOVE TO YOU TakeOff  SENDING HEALING ENERGY TO OFFSET & FAM BABY STAY FOCUS!
Takeoff is the BOSS. Why was he in the background so long.
Rip takeoff your flow will never get out of my soul 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Rest In Eternal Power and Peace, Mr Dark and Mysterious ! I am gona miss your gifts to the world. May your spirit rise to dizzy heights, plants and universe, that shine down on your legacy - to be celebrated by your present and future relatives - for many generations to come. 💔💐💞💕💓🦋🦋
These were the bone thugs of the south best hip hop group in the modern 21st century . Takeoff you will be missed .
Words can't describe how tragic his death is on the hip hop community. He came he saw and he conquered the world with his lyrical rhyme. They say you can't ask God why just know God have bigger and better plans for this man. Thank you for making good music. Your legacy will live on forever and ever. Rest in Peace TAKEOFF... Gone but never forgotten 🚀
😢
Walked on this bitch!! R.I.P Take
RIP Takeoff
I love this style and look on all three of them! And Takeoff took me out with his swag especially at the end when he hit that pose after stating his bank account gives him chills🔥🔥🔥
Mandela❣❤💕💞
Ooooooookkkkkkkkkaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Open My Bank Account, It Gives Me Chills……Takeoff the Great💙🖤 I’m Willing To Help Whoever, How Can I Help You…..Quavo the Mastermind👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Greatest Lines Of All Time And Touched My Soul🔥🔥🔥
Rip
Takeoff will always be remembered. Thank you for all the awesome music, and memories of driving around with buddies bumpin Migos. Always thought he was the best of the 3 since the beginning
So if Texas take over the case for take off death the killer can get up to 5 years to 99 years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. In Georgia or Florida take the case the same law they get a hundred years in prison plus the needle adorned by the judge and we never get out no parole no probation you were staying until you die and if you do not die you get the needle injection. Someone need to take over and help take off because he's dead you can't finish so I get the right people and authority to take over this baby case the first thing they need to do seize the camera and find out what all happened that day and get more evidence after that turn the case on to Georgia so this person can do hardcore time for taking a superstar life so young and so innocent. I'm murder victim forever. 💔😑🌟🎧🎶🇺🇸#
With The Temptations beat on there Them Migos the Real Bad Boys.
Offset left the group and there was still a hope maybe that they would reunite one day. Now that takeoff is gone that will never happen unfortunately. It sucks that this legendary group had to go out like this. Smh it’s so sad. I hope Quavo and Offset can work it out and they will. REST IN PEACE TO TAKEOFF 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Takeoff went off this one this let you know he was on his rap shit Rip Takeoff 🙏🏾
RIP Take one , one of his hardest verse
R.I.P Takeoff. I feel like they owe it to Takeoff to keep it going and get back together and do one more Culture 4. I know they said they recorded over 100 songs together during the pandemic. Quavo and Offset can set they differences aside for 1 more run for there brother and his family. Top 5 rap group all-time.
Love u #takeoff
MOMMMMMMA
Rip takeoff 😥😥
R.I.P Take Off smh
If "This tew much" was a person!! Love you Takeoff 🛫!!!!
Takeoff...💙💙💙💙💙

Came back again 2 get my issue. I loved THIS track & ESPECIALLY takeoff's verse. They ALL sho looked Sharp 💯💔 RIP YOUNG 👑
R.I.P. TAKEOFF 🚀🚀🚀
Dam RIP fast forward 2:30 ...we miss you bru
Unbelievable talent those three together would have taken hip-hop to a whole new level they established their credibility I believe they could have taken what was wrong in the industry and made it right through their messaging. Hip-hop needs to shed the gats, straps n drugs and get back to what it was founded on bringing people together to have good vibes and if you n another click weren't vibin you would dance it off not 🔫 pop it off !!! Spread the love not hate. R.I.P Takeoff
It’s a shame that we have to die for people to find out that we are great I cried when I found this song DONT no much about these guys but I can say they are probably the only group I do like from this generation REST IN PEACE 🥤
Rest in peace takeoff

"Momma!!!"😂😂😂😂
Switch up. Switch place.  Witch case. Hit that bitch with some mace didn't even chase.  Till later that day in superior rest that case. Stacking the bodies counting 8. Needing some space. Death sticks around when you're zipping the bags2 percent on my phone  My name is Allen I'm at home You missing cromes in your dome?  Forgive the zone here's a calzone.  Bich don't eat it in cal time zone.  Eat a dick and a icecream cone. Prone.   Gotcha sniped with the Chesterman Understand take note. Antidote to take off that women's coat. 21 said who needed smoke. Pokémon I pick you. Machine gun jammed up slapped with meat. Can't compete. Ghost writes on repeat. Skeet   Take it away Flick on the plain texts Fromm the other day Tell em Al's out to play.   Flagging all of my plays  Throwing me in disarray  Will I ever come to fame Does it even matter when  I'm killing my prey.  Devil is staying away Decisively acting on things that Send me away. Don't ever get caught What my dad would always say. Sometimes the bigger man walks away To duck in the shade. Till a 45 is clicked back now words become truant like I was back in the day.  Race against prejudice read out what cards will get paid. Depends on the case. Playing an betting my house so I'm hoping all doesn't fade away. Come out of the dark to work on what's been killing me.  Absent from your mentorship. How am I supposed to show my place No one licensed to kill. Dishonored the Sam till. Fight for my own honor because in the military it would be just a meal. It'd be more like 3 with a cot. I don't get caught.  I bought success on a lyrical walk. Predatos stalk I just check stocks sign and cash hit the dash when people ask for that.  Fucking with my money on my own so can't be jacked . It's a hack.  Loogie spit on the ground. Could be found all crystallized and brown. Jk. Stellar corruption. In cloquet bound to the game I hope I can tred so I don't drown. What if a star was never born now? That thought gots me feeling down.  Think the best but death is usually lurking around.  Every day is my last I predict I'll be like Wilson and get found.  Until then I'll tell stories to myself until I'm mentally unsound.   GhostBrother I learned so much from you.  Your bars enlightened my soul when I was on my last bowl. When girl up and abandoned me. You were there. Repairs happened through the bars you spit. It's lit. Together one day I hope like fire to Flynn. I'm a Sim. Lights dim. Scratch that.  Avalanche is a broken bucket I scratched that. Now I walk around trying to find myself through music . You inspire me your brotherhood could never abuse it. Candy paint is beautiful fuse it?Different type of flow.a type 0. Favorite for those who are old and want more years.  They'd kill and vampire me if I wasn't down on ten toes. I glow. Ultraviolet pro Era feel. Keep my mouth sealed if it isn't real. I'm your favorite rapper's meal waiting to get unsealed. But no one wants to give a white folk a deal.  Damn how it goes. Privileged suburban nah more rez omen. Pow wow ground groping.  Teepee crewing creeping out in the open. Tradition cards still folded. Call me bolted. Can't be saying hussian without knowing it's emboldenedMission completed.  Auto deleted. So conceded. So many pleaded. Stealing my bars it'll be tract and repeated. Bo no strikes and still genius. Smoking dope isn't cool but Damm it gets me heated where mom says go and be seated. Stood tall still undefeated.  Boxing in a box is so redundant. Fuck it get me refunded. I bunded. Ti can pardon that squeeze. Sour cream easy with the E for everyone.  Be on notice I carry the go and go under radar not noticed.  Why I'm novice.  The ops are on me that's why I whip out my stick to defend the scars.  I've showed them.  Shut it down because the government is cautious with what's said.  Cslll that potus. Swag a tag. Dog loyal yet fake. How when I only got 1 face. Learned from presenting shit. It's been years since I got a present. Dad's not present he's in heaven.  I got a slurpee from 7 11. Listen to mac then get to stepping. Day to day. This is my hustle. Grinding In a secure way. 50 cigs butts in the ash tray.  Tell russia to pray.  That's all I really should sayFuck it. Write it out. Washing my mouth. Cleaning my teeth. To let you know.  How could there even be beef when we both eat I just use commodities.  Know bitches like I know astrology.  Stick to myself give to much to bitches they try to look down on me. Can't when a soar eagly.  Bring the fire man in the cave.  Craving a rave . Never been cool enough to fit in so I'm praying for heavens sakeCall the pound. Demand a bag. Chopp it down until its powder easy down.  No firsts.  Dead gunned down in a hurse. Might wake up with Wayne like rebirth. Cruise threw the tracks like it's on my arm. Show no harm.  Tricking the alarm. Takin the farmFuck it then billy. I'm alone.  How it's Been anyway.  I'm modeling moving wieght Keeping it on the page.  Different stage. I see the beat I ryme away. Rain come a day  Soaked outside waiting to kill To many bills. All I want is a meal Keep it trill then flipped the page  New book. Iverson shook. Lay up. Like my head. Don't bow down  Grab the bow and shoot em down.  Running the page Light the sage Pray for them better days  I'm not here to save  The broken safe  I'm a deck of cards. Specifically  The ace. Sometimes switch to be the joker  Marijuana I wanna smoke her Marilogo I want to own her But instead I got to look over my shoulder  Politician greed might take me over  Tell me to get sober.  Yet do fishy shit on the side.  I live my life and stay in my lane  I'd run in front of a train rather them  Steal my brain. I'm I. Reign. King true. On a mue with a select few. Choose.  To win or loose. With way the wiegh in is a fight I don't feel ill looseSomething go's to versus Gohan piccolo reborn hentai purses Chinese diplomats wonder where I'm at Our country likes to flourish  I'm hiding spitting on churches Pastors aren't saints . People to talk to But when trust isn't granted  People speaking behind the backs Of people who Don't know this  People have shadows they run from Not knowing where the worth is. Feeling worthless. Touching those by music is better than a rabbi spending to much words that isn't kosher. I'm not a Jewish  I'm shape-shifting thoughts on different mercies. Can't be stopped until something is done on missing persons. To much pain in the world to describe holy folks prevent curses. Evil lurks in eyes of foes who are respected but hide their truths like what's done gets abortedWhats going on in the world. Politicians treating gp like ponds  Feeling like a king. Biden is on.  Switched positions  Chess board bishops got nothing to say Just aye. Higher than the pope Smoking on dope. Enlightening my flow. Last name trulson. Under the bridge troll. Red hot Chilli avoided . Spicy shit I ain't with it. Burger with some buttered bud    Scrimmages with it.Tuner thunder in a blender eaten by bender traded for shelter. Robotic weather. Severe strikes electric slide right on by. Oh my. Was irrelevant shooting dry. No more blanks hollowtips in the mags when I'm shooting it's life or death. On the shit stirring up a mess hoping in return I get blessed because how much I've given I most def earned my street cred. Suge get thrown back in They're on stand by. I need my paper through a drive by. Shit wasn't free one thing I don't like is people taking for granted freedoms only I pressed. None the less. Just another testSkate. How to escape fate. Where's faith.  Where's the hate to eliminate. Pain is weakness leaving the body and mind. Learn to anticipate ever move and who you make it with.  I plead the 5th. I need help producing. But my words are love felt not abusing. Your bats are amusing. Harlow stays prone to God's that are fusing. Honestly . Writing words with you is a new beginning when your not used to not suffering. DamnFew people know me.  People try an slow me.  Fast line for a bitch to blow me. Fake bitches be bologna.  Ruffled lips. Eating chips. Reminisce  Hear a hiss I don't miss. Bars or steel.  To be your brother you got to know I'm originally a mitch. Going through obstacles illegally. Talking shit to the politicians that come correct when greetting me. Knowing the owe me cash pleading fee. 70 bills . Patiently I wait with my soldiers giving word dontlet the package get late. If my dogs straight, then no one can hate. Everybody has problems that relate  . Fishing for money hope I caught bait.  GhostWhats the sync.  Blink. Mattis dreams. General Shadow hides in gallows.  Don't know what follows I can ball tho. What's my worth Who has the right to speak on that word  Only God many judge I love to watch Fast forward thoughts on future visions Precision on what I say. Skaw Skoden. Bring oden let it snow then  Trek out the woods got noticed.  Squatched the beef and gave out platters.  Call it Ian.  It's naturally a disaster WHT really matters  Sasquach. Grandma's squash. Turkey dinner.  Tomorrow evening giving more words to inspire the greats. Up the chain of command I'm a 8. Loyal to my fate .  Even if I'm murdered throw in a lake. At the end of the day I'm still making money others put on faucet and seem fake.   I'm great . Made enough to be remembered so where I'm sitting I'm proud and not worried. It's all fake
Momma 😆😆😆

I've never heard of Mygoat.
Back here since the album drop.! Avalanche is another level 🎚️ in album
Takeoff 🚀

Papa Was a Rolling Stone but now I got I got better my boss is getting more care now I'm reading more better at this at this.

Quavo did his job,, Offset did 8/5,,Takeoff took flightttttt🚀🚀
This is a hit
🔥
This is what happened https://youtu.be/RgRrFDIrym0
They got A+ on the group project assignment
great remix of PAPA WAS A ROLLING STONE by TEMPTATIONS (1972 )  ------------ Wish these groups that do remix would still give credit to original  artist
They all did this beat some justice
Takeofffff
it's good to see music with a story to tell, I like this format it's cool to watch  And there were the French subtitles 👍😄 And i like when Takeoff say " She asked me to pay for the ass to get lift, I asked her i'm better off getting you a lyft  This punchline made me laugh 😂 He is a good man 😂
Not talks to Quavo ?? Serions ,fucking presta !!
🔥🔥🔥🥶
Awesome

Takeoff all the way🔥🔥💯

This song made me realize how underrated Takeoff is

How do the migos get praised for what they do it’s this new generation who unappreciative
best song
They making a run for the greatest rap group ever... bones up there OutKast and others are up there but these boys ain’t done yet that’s the crazy part
2:12 Offset passing the scissors for the blunt discretely 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don’t think this generation knows how powerful this song is just by using a Temptation sample.. pure gold
Why do takeoff always have the last verse???
This group has always been. My group the second best rap group of all time Lil Jhon and the Eastside boys is my 1st aah and they take over this generation group of rap music they sound and rap flow is just to the extreme keep it up guys can't wait to see yall In Concert I want to be on stage lmao

“Put a hole in ya head not ya legs, put my hands on her head she a pet, MIGO ni that’s the set, fuck that PO imma just pay it, WHITE GLASS IN MY LAMBO LOOK LIKE ITS ALBINO”😩😩😩 by far my favorite moment on the track
this a top 3 migos song OAT👀👀CLASSIC💯
Over them old school samples of smooth flow with the 808s
This is what pimp C envisioned before he passed away

Offset is one of the best rappers in the game period.
“Ain’t nothing wrong with enhancing it’s yours”🔥
Before you ignore this remember that everyone started from somewhere. Hello Im Khari, Im a lover of it all Bossa Nova, Hiphop, Rock, and the beautiful jazz. I made a track called "On and Off Again" . For years I wanted to be a musician but fear always made me say "My time is too late, I missed my shot" so at 26 I became fed up with the day to day, moved to rural japan  and started putting out music. This song is all about the the hot and cold moments of liking someone. One minute you're all into them, the next minute you want more. The instrumental is from a superb American producer SJ, living in China. I also created a new genre Hip-hop + City Pop #CityHiphop. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq28baRZdm0
I like the Migos
❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is a masterpiece
These young brother are super talented!!!😊❤👏👏👏🎵🎼🎶😎
“She asked me to pay for ass to get lift, I told her I’m better off giving u a Lyft” underrated🔥🔥 3:24

You can sample anything if you’re creative enough.
Whole album sounds like all the other culture albums so it's a big flop trash asf

MOMMA
This shit dope
🔥🔥🔥
@kim malone its a japanese skin lightening lotion fer.la/42. It says in the article the african american hollywood celebrities use it because it easily changes their skin color from dark skin to light skin mixed race,however they deny it. I guess they deny using the lotion because they want people to think they are naturally light skinned and not bleaching their skin lighter,they should just be honest.
The Way Quavo Ate That OH GOD🔥🔥🔥
Excellent 👌🏽 merci beaucoup les boug.
90' 🇨🇱🔥🔥
They want to be jimmy jam terry Lewis and jellybean lololol
Takeoff just Tookoff in front of us !
I can't put them down for trying to change but it's going to take more to be the greatest of all time especially comparing themselves to rolling stones. They should of compare themselves in the black artist group. But back in the day Rolling stones were a hit I wasn't a fan of rock and roll but look at Delegations Tempations and Ojays can't leave those groups out also spinners
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼🇨🇵🇸🇷💙💙
this shit hard 😂🔥
It's different but it works 🔥🔥🔥
I bet Joe Button even like this

The only song on Culture III I’m not conflicted about. This song go hard. But with the rest of the album it’s just kinda boring. Like the flows are catchy but not very memorable also the beats are boring aside from this jazzy shit goin on here.

Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you. They're either lonely, they're missing somebody, they're depressed, they're hurt, they're scarred from the past, they're having personal issues no one knows about, they have secrets you wouldn't believe. They wish, they dream and they hope. And right now, they are sitting here reading these words, and I'm writing this for you so you dont feel alone anymore. Always remember, don't be depressed about the past, don't worry about the future, and just focus on today. If today's not so great don't worry! Tomorrow's a new chance. If you are reading this, be sure to share this around to make others feel better. Have a nice day! :)

HI EVERYONE! HOPE Y'ALL HAVING A GOOD DAY. I need your help. English language is not spoken much in my country. And yeah I tried to rap in English. Can I take your a few seconds to give it a shot and be brutally honest about my accent or use of language? That would be appreciated. You are the best :)
I can through the fuck shit. Respect for that one 💯
Take off took tf off but really its popping I love it
I love the migos but I laugh everytime they do Adlibs idk why
Yesssss!! Glad y’all back !! You’ve been missed 🥰🔥
Seeing them in this video made me have a thought. Does anyone know if there are trio's were rappers use the same lyrics, but each member is in a different register. You get the color of a bass, baritone, and tenor resulting in a kind of sprechstimme of sorts?
The beat is tearing my bass speaker
We will fail every time; it is in our nature to SIN. It is only through the  BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST, that we can acquire complete forgiveness. We can all attain this by just accepting Jesus as our Savior, and accepting that He shed His BLOOD to atone for the sins of all who repent.   1. If you need help with ANYTHING in your life, all you need to do is ask God in JESUS name. I am not trying to preach here, but this REALLY works!   2. Just ask JESUS to FORGIVENESS of your sins!  And then say this BELOW.  3.  Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.  4. I am serious, this really works! Just say the LORDS PRAY Above, anytime you need HELP. It is that simple......
alr a classic
Do Migo's producer only have that 1 beat. Seriously it has been ages and yall still using this same recycle beat?
👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶

“Nobody Judge you but God” Facts 🙏🏽❤️

I like them but all the songs starting to sound a like
Please bring back the 80ees,90ees and very early 2000 hip hop back please because this sucks.
They lit ATL stand up
Here before 1 zillion
I came here after Jay z's comment to give it a chance. It's aight. The beat is the best part.
Takeoff is the definition of cold 👌👌
ㄹㅇ 전혀 안 구리고 앨범이 이번꺼가 한번에 확 느낌오는 곡이 없어도 계속 듣다보면 톡톡튀면서 때리는 라임 많아서 중독성있는데 실망했다는 애들은 앨범 10번이상 돌려볼 생각은 했나 싶다
sounds better without the 808
This is a classic 💨💪👊☝️💯💋
LMFAO THEY ADLIBS ARE FUCKING HILARIOUS I LOVE EVERY BIT OF IT BRUH. I HONESTLY PREFER THIS ALBUM BETTER THAN POLO G HOF AND I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE SAYING THAT SHIT ABOUT POLOS NEW ALBUM. CULTURE 3. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤜🤛🤜🤛🤔🤔

They once mentioned Shaka Zulu😉
If you have to put stuff in a time capsule to show the future you need to put takeoff MOMMA!!!     ad-lib
Obviously I'm here famalam
Classic Trappy WTF🔥🔥🔥
Offset bop while he rapping is a vibe
I wanted to like it...but I dont...the voices are overpowering the music. To me it clashes instead of a smooth transition from the original to the sound they have.
https://youtu.be/JS8L9jkuZTw
Im from NY and imma tell you right now this album is a classic 🔥 their flows are smooth all through the album
Migos Mufukin Back.... 6 Million Views in 3 Days..... Shittttt 💯💯💯
Killed it 🔥
Takeoff😘🔥🔥
Masterpiece ✨
The snotty chance strangely untidy because music recurrently inform during a cold restaurant. silent, obeisant sidecar
The optimal hour prenatally amuse because sponge ultrascructurally whisper amid a gleaming pear. four frail, exotic sand
Takeofff went NUTS!!
TAKEOFF
they killed this one
Takeoff kill the song I just love his verse always rep 👌🏾💯
Of course takeoff kills this song. Like every other Migos song he has been on.

These tracks have zero longevity but y’all not ready for that convo
Long live offset
They sampled “Papa was a rollin’ stone” by the temptations, and it fits perfectly!
Offset on fire 🔥
"Hocus pocus, pull up in a Lotus and my diamonds sick just like I got ebola" - Takeoff
The vibe of them as a group is a sight to see. I jus finished the album yesterday and all I can say is that I will definitely be repeated.  And this song right here is a smooth avalanche lol
Nelson Mandela will live forever.
these migos going crazy rolling dice back do lil joe ya heard
I feel like Takeoff write everybody verses.
The unbiased lotion traditionally rain because mustard cellularly fix times a unable respect. fat faulty, bitter underclothes
This whole album is so dope !! Say what you want about Trap this shit is fire 🔥. But the beat drop tho ya could have warned us Im at the red light with volume UP vibin then BOOM them 12’s hit so hard the cop next to me started bobbing lol.
Takeoff .🔥
The wasteful low strangely include because shade neurophysiologically happen failing a silly ice. powerful, deep reason
I hate it people calling it temptations it’s the fire soundtrack from the bad motherfucker shaft but these Migos are 💯🔥💯💯💯💯👏🙌🙌🙌
I don't think its impossible to have a favorite Migo if you're a REAL fan!  You try to pick a fave but you cant cause they collectively bring they own sauce to make the perfect dish EVERYTIME!  Thank you Migos for sharing with us y'all talent!  #BlackExcellence
Fasho these boys really getting off and having they way with this shit

This song is kind of good in a Car in gta
Am I the only one that was doing a two step with takeoff😂😂
Takeoff is the best migo, I’ve been saying this for years. Why are people just now realizing that?  The only reason he doesn’t put out much music like Offset and Quavo is because Takeoff is their special weapon. He’s deadly with the word play.   Edit: this is just MY opinion. no need for everyone in the comments to get in their feelings.
Yeah dats dem Migos 🔥
Dats wassup🤙🏿💯🎩
When offset took off his glasses 🔥 2:26
Increase online sales of your product on Instagram. This app only costs $3.

Jesus loves you all so much! He died on the cross for the price of our sins and 3 days later, he rose from the dead. He died for our sins so that we may have eternal life in Heaven with him and not perish in Hell. If you believe that with all your heart and confess that you are a sinner and in need of a savior, you will be saved! Come to Jesus and believe on him today!

We knew Quavo was gon talk about that Bentley on this album but did y’all 👀 when Takeoff said go jump off a cliff..def thought about Saweetie jumping off that cliff in the Best Friend video lol. They know what they doin.
Let’s Go!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥

"No one can judge you but God....... "  Amen to that !!
Takeoff is like a flea market version of Krayzie Bone. Only Krayzie has countless flows and styles, while Takeoff is limited to his one flow he rips from Kray. Kray been spitting that flow since the early 90s.
Take off went crazy
Out of all the songs, this one is the most heartfelt. So proud that Migos are redefining the past by mastering the future 🙌❤️❤️❤️
Gotta give it to Quavo, Offset, and Take went crazy forsure but feel like Quavo don’t get his credit or he just expected to carry idk 🔥🔥🔥🔥

grosse dingz
the people that disliked dont like trap music

Su tiempo ya fue , solo hacen temas simples y repetitivos...aunque sea cambien el estilo de sus beats...🤦‍♂️
THIS IS 🔥 🔥.
Takeoff is outta this world gifted with his flow and lyrics as well..the best one out the group but they all came with that 🔥
The real question is... how did they get this Tempations sample cleared 🙌🔥🔥😭
Offset⭐
Migos are on heat🔥🔥 Living legends✨
QUAVO IS A GOD ‼️

When Offset bounces his shoulders to be the beat, looking like an Old School OG. MAAAAAAAANN! Fuck it up Offset!!

This is one of the rare occasions,  I wish I lived in America. Then I could go to a shop, purchase a firearm. And proceed to blow my fucking brains out! Rap/Hip Hop music is in Defcom 3. It’s almost extinct! This is some Bullshit!
Keep streaming bro we gon beat wolo G
Those Black gods ( Handle that)
takeoff doesnt get the credit he deserves he literally goes hard on any song except bad n boujee........
Is this from final fantasy 7?
When they sampled "Papa Was A Rolling Stone" from one of my favorite groups of all time The Temptations, I just knew it was going to be straight Fire!

THAT NGGA TAKEOFF FLOW.....DAMMMMMM
A lil bit of choreography would've sealed the deal.
Real talk, this shit hittin! Would love to see them performe this live with a real band playing the Temptations sample! Cold blooded fellas!
Poppa was a rolling stone. Young boys don't know nothin' bout that.
Quavo snapped on this song. Most of the time I always prefer Takeoffs verses over all of them. But nah Quavo went beast mode with his verse on this song. He owned this one. That's the beauty of the Migos. They can each take turns on being great
Best song for me
Take off the goat
Now that's the Migos we know just a breath of fresh air to hear takeoff bando days ad-lib
I love Migos,but Takeoff something serious! God Bless these Black Kings 🤴

This is the best song from them . Maybe the temptation beat got me liking it even more but they did all go on this beat

Is this the song when say something about Kendrick Perkins???
People that say that these guys mumble rap don't understand what the hell they're saying.  These guys got bars if you listen to what they're saying. They birthed the flow they have that all these new guys are using now. They're definitely iconic.

Take Off toooook offffffffff 🔥
I’m sorry but whoever says Takeoff is underrated is wrong. I feel like fans see his personality and automatically think he’s “underrated.” He’s a low-key guy but the fact that everyone says he’s underrated proves that he’s not. Any Migos fan or Hip-hop fan knows how good Takeoff is.  PS: I’m not tryna sound woke or anything I’d just love to give him his creds
Offset: I'm Richie rich like Lionel💥💥
Polo mid
I lol'd so hard when he said none of us ever had no father.. You and 80% of all African Americans. You ain't special.
Horrible.. Just horrible... Not rap! Not hip hop! Just pure, manufactured for kids, garbage!
Takeoff underated
pap
FORTNITEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
#Migos #3Goats
This that true inspiration shit! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Besides Take Off, the actual rapping is awful 🙄
Takeoff forgot to sanitize the mic after offset used it!
I'm from Portugal and Migos is my favorite band, I already had the pleasure of seeing Migos live at Super Bock Super Rock on 6/20/2019.  The Migos' best-known song is Bad and boujee, with a billion views.  All Migos fans let's help Walk It Talk It reach 550 million views
MOMMA😂
Juste waou ❤️🤯 🔥🔥🔥
Best Rap Group Of My Era….90s babies
Takeoff will take off in this one... 3 is a charm...
Offset spitting  making it look so easy💥💥
I'm not gonna fake on these dudes,they started a trend especially the choker chains. Shoutout Migos.
Best song Migos have ever put out, no cap

Quavo has kids? Or a kid?
These guys aren't talentless but, they just like all the rest chasin tha bag! Artist in this era just don't have much of a signature sound IMO. We gotta hone in on our originality like we did in the Golden Age of hip-hop. Lot of good talent out there just need to find them selves .
Offset really handsome
'They must of forgot we the Migos! Lol that's a bar from the pop!
Take Off sheeeeeesh!!!!

Offset talking  Quavo rolling some weed  Take off takes first puff 😂😂😂
When take off said “MAMA” I felt that
I guess it's their style, but theirs no coherent sentences, lots of broken small sentences. I just finished listening to T.I - What it's come to... and he's spitting whole verses
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. That is all. Now back to your regular program.
When everyone partakes in the group assignment
Off Set with the Rose Gold GMT Master is not a joke!
Poppa was a rolling stone.. I fuck with this
👌
This song is SICC 🔥❤️🔥
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
🔥🔥🔥🔥 migos back

Great context.everyone needs more than there salary to be financially stable.the best thing to do with your money is to invest it rightly.because money left for saving always end up used with no returns.i started investing in Bitcion mid November 2020 with the help of a well-known professional Mr Jose Baxter and synergyteam I made 5figures monthly the entire profit funded my duplex  🇺🇸
Lol... Takeoff said " Open my bank account and it gives me chills" ....FACTS!!!!! Helluva track, and this will get endless spins on the radio......👍

John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

Never been a Migos fan even tho the first time I heard bad and boujee i knew the song would be a hit. Lately I have been liking the songs they making. I think this album is going to be dope. That's huge coming from the guy who still stucked on 90s hip hop and hate most this generation so called hip hop.
Idgaf what nobody say bc jay-z payed homage to these niggas
Nope

The word "gullible" isn't in the dictionary. 10. Honk if you like peace and quiet.      Editorial:     Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com

For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)

They Back At It AGAIN 🔥🔥🔥
I pray this encourages someone 🙏🏽🕊  I spent a majority of my youth pretending to be someone I wasn’t. I wanted so desperately to be cool, to be noticed, to be liked..I didn’t like who was staring back at me in the MIRROR. I LIED to sound interesting, I LIED to appear funny, I LIED to get anyone to notice me. I wanted GIRLS to notice me...I was constantly chasing that relationship with ANYONE.. Since 2nd grade, constantly seeking the opposite sex. In 6th grade, I began to think about sex..alot I began to “self satisfy” any chance I got. Looking back at the habits I developed in that mindset...it makes me hang my head in shame. My Grandparents divorced, my parents divorced..it only made sense I was seeking that “intimacy”...any intimacy would do the job.. Habits I developed in my youth, overflowed and poured over into my Adulthood..almost cost me my marriage, my relationship with my children..it almost cost me my LIFE..  🩸🩸🩸🕊🕊🕊 I don’t write this, in search of pity.. I don’t share this, to tell you a story.. YOU ARE READING THIS RIGHT HERE AND NOW IN THIS MOMENT, because YOU made a choice, to watch this video and scroll through the comments, like you have always done.  But this time is different, because THIS is the moment someone brought you the good word 🙏🏽 That there is a God that sits on high, and he is waiting for you. He is waiting for you to lift up the past you’ve let drive your present, up to him! He is waiting for you to pull away from the habitual sin you have been living in! He is waiting for you to shout his name in praise on your darkest nights! He is waiting for you to stop asking the questions that don’t matter, and dig into his word! Waiting for you to take hold of the fact he sent his son to die the death that YOU AND I DESERVE!! Waiting for you to dig into his word for your redemption! The redemption that awaits the vessel developed in love, the vessel with the royal blood of heaven flowing through its veins!  This is for you!! The one who couldn’t stare in the mirror, the one who died!! This is for the one that HAS NO OTHER PLACE TO GO..BECAUSE THE LORD OUR GOD FOLLOWS US INTO THE DEEPEST PLACES, THE DARKEST PLACES, JUST TO TELL US HOW MUCH HE LOVES US, AND HAS PLANS TO PROSPER YOU AND TO NEVER HURT YOU!!  LOOK INTO THE MIRROR!! LOOK DEEP INTO YOUR OWN EYES!! PREACH TO YOURSELF!! TALK TO YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER AND ACCESS THE PATH THAT LEADS TO HIS GLORY, TO HIS WILL!!  Look into the mirror, acknowledging that you have FOUND GOD, and begin your WALK WITH GOD..by developing a relationship with his son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ 🕊🕊🕊  LOOK INTO THE MIRROR...  And start the habit of seeing YOURSELF, the way GOD SEES YOU..  Created in his image, beautifully made, for MEANING AND PURPOSE  🕊🕊🕊🩸🩸🩸  🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽Glory be to God!!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽  If you have read this far, God bless you, if you have a few minutes listen to my NEW song “Mirror Image” on my page. Shut down everything else and join me as I  share many of the thoughts that I had with MYSELF, while looking into the mirror.. Join me as I talk to the man staring back at me, my MIRROR IMAGE 🕊🩸🙏🏽  https://youtu.be/hpFeh1l5YcA

Migos dropping bangers again 🔥🔥🔥
⛽️🔥
For real though I don’t listen to this type of music. But I Read some lyrics. This stuff is bad for your soul. Read the lyrics and ask yourself “would I want my daughter/son saying this or promoting this?” Or “would I be okay if some of these things happened to someone I love?” The culture continues to put out hypocritical music that pollutes the culture and society everyday. It’s sad. Jesus Christ can set you free. Repent from your sins and turn towards the real Jesus of the Bible. I hope anyone who takes the time out to read this would come to know Him. ✝️❤️
I Love a Black Man in a suit.  I rarely saw my Grandfather or Greatgrand and Uncles in jeans. #fire #blackwallstreet. Migos did Y'ALL Thang on this one congratulations 👏🙌👌

The sample is just magic
Ok I fucks with it but I don’t like they sampled the TEMPS and then compared themselves to The Rolling Stones as being the greatest group cause just cause you may be the most known doesn’t mean you were the greatest temptations had more talent in my opinion at least when it comes to lasting music
This hits different
Take off always takes off!

Everybody time is short I tell you it's really short we are about to reach the point of no return. Please return to the our father in heaven whose name is actually Ahayah Asher Ahayah (paleo hebrew) or i am that i am, thru our savior his son Yashaya our salvation is at hand we need to repent now. Also hold fast to the 10 COMMANDMENTS that are in Exodus chapter 20 and the FEAST DAYS. They're planning a false flag nuclear attack on America And NYC soon go look at the news and the fallen ones (aliens) are going to reveal their self along with the antichrist who well establish a false peace out of this world war 3 chaos that's gone be created. Repent now and accept the salvation and pray that you may be worthy to escape the torments and temptation that's coming upon the earth in the rapture that's going to happen real soon🤷🏿‍♂️❤️🙏🏾

@lisa burns its a japanese skin lightening lotion. It says in the article the african american celebrities in hollywood use it because it actually changes their skin color from dark skin to light skin mixed race,however they deny it fer.la/62 i guess they deny using this  lotion because they just want people to think they are naturally light skinned and not bleaching their skin lighter.
Omfggggggg
I’m OG grew up with Tupac Scarface and I got to say these Migos just made it to hip-hop Hall of fame goat🐐

Crazy !
I always wanted papa was a rolling stone to get sampled into something great in today’s music but I have to say I hate it was used on the migos is lol. Felt like it should still have that emotional feel to the sample not up tempo like this but it isn’t awful. Just in my head I can hear something completely different with this sample
It looks to me that they bit Silk Sonic's groove in this video. They did a great job at it too, its just a rap song and not R & B..💯
DAMN Takeoff didn't have to go that hard 😳🔥
Migos is the best rapper right now.
Hip hop or not , they slay errythang!!
❄️  I  C  E  ❄️
Was it "put my hands on her head, she a peg....or pet?" Either way that shit's pretty funny 🤣
They came a long way, Migos deserve the win 🙏🏾💯
Every like is a “SHEEEESH!!!”

🆙🆙🆙
Verzuz: Migos vs Bone Thugs.  Why not? 🤷🏾‍♂️
It’s so evident they all treat each other equally . And no one has an ego, like just look at each time they go , whoever has a verse is in the middle. They the new Rolling Stones
“with a stick, come in peace, Mandela” now y’all won’t get the STICK reference to Mandela although Qua meant GUN obviously but back in the early life on Nelson M, playing with sticks with his brothers was a form of peace instead of fist fighting or any other means of violence
Yo set flowing!!!
this gave me some blues brothers vibes
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Migos been here forever. I fix with the movement.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Album already a classic

I heard the sample and was excited so I put my other earbud in and immediately said "wtf." Not in a good way either. There's a such thing as a key but they didn't believe in one on this song. Their voices and flow dont make sense for the sample that's used.
The Goats, plain and simple
I'm willin to feed whoever
Feed the real! Fuck A Snake!!!!!!!
the beat reminded me of sift heads bruh
They look like they're a mafia group that has three bosses
We the rolling stone.. yo theses guys are really that dumb to comparer themselves with the rolling stones.. these guys need to stop taking drugs their brains are dead to even think they close

Should have gotten Ghost writers for this. The vibe, the beat, the visuals/theme and confessional cut-ins were all top notch. Sadly the lyrics fell flat.
These boys finna take over the summer again just like 2016 🐐!
Bruhhh “Trap Jazz” needs to become even more mainstream and perfected it’s a hard ass chill vibe (upon reflection Trap&B could be a category this belongs under)
“Cut the stereo all the way up, fire you one up, press play from the top, don’t skip... Culture III”  Say less Qua 💯
Oh this it chief 🤟🔥
The OG Migos are baaacckkk! 🔥
