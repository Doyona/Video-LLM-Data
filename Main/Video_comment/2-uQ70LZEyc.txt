The craziest part isn’t that Josh broke the laws of physics again — it’s that Raft somehow survived it. Props to the devs for building a game strong enough to handle pure chaos.

Should the devs pay a little more attention to the 'details' ?
15:12 the sunk boat has 67 on it 🙏
3:40  he committed a war crime
This is actually been very helpful for somebody that doesn’t know what they’re doing thank you
So I have to start over because I can’t even control my raft six sales and it still won’t go the direction I want to go
no physics with planks
idc bout raft, but dis is fkn entertaining :D
17:06 67🥹
why isnt the bad one black hehehe
I just got raft when I watched this 😂
We enjoy your chaos, Josh. I hope Raft gets another update so we see how you can destroy the game now
" Oh 😳 Oh🤔 Oh 😏" lol 😂
i'm always so impressed by Josh's sheer stubbornness and determination to do the most tedious things
man craves The Polyhedron from pathologic
31:13 the voices are coming from the darkness
15:53 it is an anti glitch city
Have you ever done a video from Skyrim? My house is the most immaculate (disgusting) house, containing every single item I have collected since I started my character, all, and I mean all, over the house.  You have no room to move.
I have been watching whatever this is since I was 6 💀
im so glad you play the game normaly🙂
25:31 bro has no limits when it comes to patience whatsoever
give me a minute.... 9 hours later
17:09 67 TS SO TUFF BOII 😂😂🫱🫱
Jetzt gehen wir dort schon einmal Videos von EY
MANGO MANGO MANGO AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 67 SKIBIDI TOILET
17:08 didn't know Josh knew ball like that.... (67)
bro is literally backseat streams.
Love how pissed off he sounds when the game reminds him he's a mortal being
17:08 3 years later and and the number here is a popular number. Seems like the devs expected this number to become popular
17:09 yo 6 7
ha forbidden espresso
EUUGH owchie :(
17:09 67 😂
me: "he's gonna do this normally?" one minute later... Him: "NO CLIP!
I thought he was about to make something with the rugs in the first portion
Rhymes with grug 3:27
12:04 HELLO?!
26:27 fine I’m going over here in his brain does love 26:29  to be side
So it's rust, but on water, and kinda crap? Basically MadMax to Waterworld then of survival games then.
Your content is so boring. It’s not boring.(this is not meant to be rude.)
Walking on ground ❌️  Walking on planks ✅️
25:28 oh nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i JUST got raft and this is just peak
6:26 looks beautiful
The Wooden Surfer
17:12
Jesus Christ the editing makes this unwatchable, speaks sentences far too quickly one after the other
best video I ever watched
6:30 oh god it actually looks half decent 😭
7849
17:09
Oh... my.... goodness..... I just realized how many viewers and videos you have. Well. Congrats on being extremely rich. For real though youre talented at whatever this is
Bro is defying the laws of physics
Josh is like Dexter. His face looks way too sane for his shenanigans.
the raftbuilding in this game is cool but god i hate the story progression the island exploration is so bad. go here solve mind numbingly boring and janky puzzles get location of new place rinse repeat its so bad
in a game with mostly brown people the main villian is a white man...ofc
17:08 SIX SEVEN
still peak 3y latter
I know Grace still plays and let’s get it out our best friends. I just can’t prove it yet.
My Comments Never Last Apparently- But I Watched This On REPEAT For Like An Entire Year!! (On My Way To School, Using Just The Audio)  It Kinda Feels Nostalgic To Me? .o.
I lost it when he build into the city and wandered the streets... on boards
Hi
17:09 six seven
Satisfactory didn't run this well with the tornado....props to the developers for surviving this man's creativity!
Yes i Like this
17:09 6-7???
*gimme a few minutes* *9 hours later*
its crazy that this guy starts over from scratch for most games every single video (basically destroying 200 hours of madness each video)
I have an idea regarding your rug-on-floor design. It involves a failed painter. Any guesses?
So what item broke the game?
6:00 "Now that it looks like a screen saver from 20 years ago."  Instant nostalgia flashback!
Kannst du eigentlich selber ganze normale Sätze sprechen oder schneidest du alle deine gesprochenen Sachen 1000 x damit auch nur im Ansatz irgendwas sinnvolles rauskommt?  Was ein Lappen du bist und was du eigentlich kannst🤣
Why do you keep on building bullshit build something good 🤦
The value proposition of giving you access to games is just ridiculous XD Not only do you provide some of the best bug testing possible but you amplify the reach of their game a ton through your audience and comedy! I love watching your stuff!
17:09  067
12:05 the dedication is crazy
Hm very nice
I'm not a nuclear physicist but I'm fairly certain that a mere three control rods inserted into the core of a nuclear reactor will not be sufficient to stop an overload. Reactors have hundreds of control rods.
There was a Sierra game, or a Lucasarts game, can't remember which - where even if you know the code number from a previous playthrough the combination lock will not open until your character has learnt the code in THIS playthrough.  So be careful before embarking on a 10,000 combination brute forcing, lol
Mango 67🤲
Geneva conventionn
17:10 67
YO I USEE UR MOD ON OPERA N ITS SO COOL CAN U MAKE A MOD ON RAFT i had cps on srry
I call it a rug,rhymes with grug
This guy reminds me of Squidward. If he was a gamer lmao
Такого безумие я не ожидал
(To my brother) GET OFF MY GODDAMN ACCOUNT AND USE YOURS
17:09  six… seven…
Lol😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
4:25 I stand corrected
Those lights are kind of good because if you lose it, you can just like swim until you see like a bunch of lights You’re smart
Let me guess, they patched the detail plank to remove underwater and water clipping.
forbidden espresso is crazy man🤣
11:32 is the start of the tornado raft
1:37 boi what the tuff
11:54 A few minutes,💀
Who’s here in 2025
17:09 67
Reputation in what society with what individuals?
Can we have a gsp and lets game uit out collab or smth
I remember watching this when it first came out and I found it very inspiring, it just popped up for me again and I’m just as inspired
The detail plank looks like it is a insane bug... But It seems very useful :3
13:40 "time to hop back aBOARD" :D  Edit: I'd just like to point out that so far this channel kinda feels like being invited into someone's mind to watch their fever dreams. Thanks for that... I guess? 😹
Good lord how long did this episode take to make in real life 🧐😳😳😳😵‍💫
Mango ??
SCP-84115, The Detail Plank. Object Class: Safe. SCP-84115 is an infinitely stretchable plank that can build in any direction, ignores the laws of physics and allows the user to build impossible ramps, breathe underwater and glitch through physical objects.
17:09  6-7😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A question for the people who made raft: have you considered what YouTubers do
You can trust Josh to not put clickbait titles in all his videos
the first time i played raft, we got to the dome and i had built a LOOONG ramp. yknow. for normal reasons. i was stood at the top when we docked and i glitched inside, and i landed in the very last apartment we needed to get to LMAOO i couldnt find anything tho so i just exited and climbed down
jesus christ this game is so bad xD
Is this available on Switch? There’s a ton on similar games, but which one is this?
normal players: cant break the game game testers: also cant break the game this guy:
You know... i do believe you tried 5960 times to find the code. I refuse to believe that's an edit
6:25 that reminds me of a floating oil rig
Devs have to feel violated after this.
do you just not run out of planks?!
I love the fact that the entire way this game was played was “oh no something is mildly inconvenient time to make it 10 times more so”
wtf
Missed opportunity for “You truly are the sharkest tool in the shed.”
Never forget the box tower the first wonder if the video
That screensaver is actually 30 years old now
im doing that
You were in my dream during a nap, as soon as I woke up I looked for the video and it doesn’t exist 😭😭😭
"hop back a board our noble steed" is that pun intended?
If graystillplays went over and shook hands with josh, the world would end due to the infinite DESTRUCTION THEY BOTH CAN INFLICT
when josh says he doesn't want to use his legs so he uses detail planks he is still walking on the detail planks
You are a good person
I hate the 1.0 update. The voice acting is stupid, the characters are annoying, and the decoration is horribly integrated. Using notes was a better approach.
I love that he does this stuff legit! I think that’s the best part! Man spent hours to make a tornado of wood in a game for our entertainment!  For his own enjoyment as well of course, but also for us! Dedicated to the craft! 😂
I’m convinced "gray still plays" is just an older version of you.
Okay, I've watched it. The dancing crab is... exactly what you'd expect and more. Here are a few options for comments, pick your favorite:  **Option 1 (Brainrot/Relatable):** > My brain cells attempting to form a coherent thought after a 14-hour Reddit binge. This is it. This is the peak.  **Option 2 (Weird/Existential):** > I've watched this 7 times and now I'm convinced the universe communicates through rhythmic crab movements. My therapist is going to love this.  **Option 3 (Pure Nonsense/Hyperbole):** > I didn't know I needed this, but now I can't imagine a world without a dancing crab. My priorities have shifted. My life's purpose has been revealed. It's crab.  **Option 4 (Short & Punchy Brainrot):** > My soul is now 80% crab. The other 20% is existential dread. Perfect balance.
Do a Collab with graystillplays
I'm not even a gamer at all but I thoroughly enjoyed this vid. This dude's hilarious! 😆
Anyone in 2025
Bro did war crime he made a red cross
Melt copper… Furnace… Water… wait a minute, this is just Hydroneer.
This is so fun to watch while very intoxicated
26:23 “Oh god, do I need to caaaaaaaare??” SUCH A MOOD
If people want to know Josh has worked on deus ex machina
Throwing the crap away at 1:07 was very expressive. Hilarious!
0:02 why does this have the Red Dead Redemption font
Dan from game grumps said this channel is good so I'm here
Gray still plays is literally u but a Florida idk if that’s u but u must colab literally he has same energy but he don’t break games but idk
I forgot this guys existed
It takes so long to get the amount of needed planks, that you can just play the game normally.
VR?
Could you not have just kept walking on the plank you were placing
The raft guy is stronger than steve as he can hold a bucķet that can stop a ship no matter the weight
Why is there not one second of silence? U dont have to edit the video like a fkn brainrot tik tok. Leave some room for brains to breathe ffs
Hey Josh, I have a very important question: did you use creative mode?!?!? Or did you genuinely just get all of these materials? Because a lot of creators are saying that you probably used creative and I have to know. Also this video made me laugh so hard it’s so good 😂 I love all your vids and I’m a big fan
Hurricane Katrina vs small raft
I have not seen raft since 2022
Creative mode
Game devs HATE this one simple trick 😅😂
Rizz
Developers: Why? Josh: Why not
If I hear ruckus. I think about him
Dude, this is why I love this channel
Man, this is so far a my favorite video
I've been watching this guy for 4 years now and I'm telling you I've never gotten bored
I knew this video was popular, but 30+ million views popular is crazy
I love that popping noise when something glitches out of existence. It gets funnier every time.
I call it a rug it rhymes with grug
How to fix a problem:  Step 1: Detail Plank
do you buy for me raft? pls'
2 years ago? I remember seeing this when it first came out (reference)
The more boards get added the more I feel like you’re playing as the avatar of some old god construct
1st Corinthians 15 1-4 (kjv) Jesus Christ shed his blood for all of our sins past present and future he died was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures and he did it willingly because he loves you and wants to spend eternity with you his blood has the power to wash away all sin if you believe and put your trust and faith in it Jesus is coming back soon to rapture us who are saved dont get left behind for the tribulation it will be the worst seven years in human history if you get left dont take the mark of the beast it is a mark put in your forehead or right hand it is a symbol of satan if you take the mark you will be condemned to hell for eternity because you chose satan over Jesus
you sound and act like if Bill Cipher was a gamer
You have a voice that sounds like you're always yelling 🤣🤣🤣 (This is a no offence comment ftr)
Perfectly safe year😊
I'm researching all of his videos because they are so entertaining
Anyone?? From 2025...?
M-M-MANGO 1:35
the ONLY LGIO video where the framerate gets to maintain its molecular structure
20:44 “scaffolding” *points to support beam*
the scream!! 😭😭
The string lights have immortal fire flys inside of the lights
He has become much more educated since he worked in the movie Buisness
1:37 m….m….mango?
Hurricane josh
He sounds like Scott McGillivray
13:30 epic😂
This guy should play subnautica>:)
1:37 M-m-MANGO?
read the title and immediately knew it'd be my absolute favorite decorating item in any game ever xD
there is ZERO reason why this wouldn't work in real life
I used to break into peoples lockers with that method you used to open the safe
I love how he never panics
25:30 lol zero percent chance. That’s over 4 hours of impossibly tedious work. You either: - got it from develooer - had Anthony code it 25:30
6:24 why does that look actually nice xD
"Hey! A friendly face!" LGIO: "...Let's not go that far."
impressive, that the game did not collapse under all those planks
NO ONE CAN SAY HE IS NOT THE GOATT!!!!!!!!!!
Creative mode looks fun
13:44 lama!
Why at one point did the raft look like the pipe screen saver
I just found your channel and wondering where have you been my whole YouTube life?
Oh boi
25:35 this guy just looks up the codes lmao 😭😭
11:55 540 minutes is not much.
I love how Josh uses an ungodly amount of planks to get to places that he shouldn’t and to get into places the way he it wasn’t intended then jumps start into a massive hole in a building while saying “oo! That garbage looks soft!”
Bro has a phd in breaking games 🤣🤣🤣
I love how. You laugh when you say and I don’t have the key.
This is so funny
28:16 I mean, they padlocked WOODEN doors so like chop it down with something
Dear Josh, While we at the video game company appreciate your superior gaming abilities, our dev team do not. Please cease and desist from any further antics. These people have spent many hours creating and rendering these puzzles for you to work tirelessly to complete. You haven’t even broken a sweat.  These are real people’s lives you’re playing with and it’s just not right. Please follow the story, as it’s been prepared for you, from now on.  Please and thank you. Your friendly neighborhood mega game company
lmao @ clipping through missions
"Vasagatan"...  Heh, the name of a street in Stockholm...
Josh used customization plank, it was super effective!
This makes me want to play Raft again.
Can you play on PlayStation
Josh change your name to “lets break a game”
Could you please team up with gray still, play and make a video together cause you’re both really good Youtubers there’s lotta videos I like of you and the other guy
25:35 fun fact each input took around 1 second so Josh spent 99 minutes putting in codes
Wait, how do you make vine goo if you don’t even have a smelter
Everytime this guy plays a game the game just became 1 frame per hour
Two years and still my favorite
He broke the game
you learned rug
The game is working as intended, I see
I love this guy's video style, lots of humor. I've watched this before but watched it again just because it's so riveting.
a shark ate his boat 😢
"Oh boy, it's time for some raft!" Cracks me up. This is my go-to comfort video lately.
MANGO MANGO MANGO... 🛐
at 4:56 it shows josh researching all this stuff, but some of the stuff that he showed he researched needs metal ingots, vine goo, bolts, etc, need a smelter to unlock, and he only had a smelter until “after” he researched all that stuff so idk
He did broke the game with 1 item 😅
I have watched this so many times
25:42 what did you just say 🤨
Anyone here in 2025
First two minutes in and already I’m like this looks like the most annoying survival craft game 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😹😹😹😹😹 at 14:18
121212122121212
I loved it dude! jajajajajajajajajajaja
"oh god do I need to care? Ughhhhhhhhh" my work life
Love you 😘
Perfect ending 🤣🤣
Oblivion had a similar feature with paintbrushes, it was amazing
The algorithm chose this video.  Enjoyed and subbed!
Oh I just know you would LOVE subnautica, but you're not gonna play it, or? 🧐
The devil’s in the Detail(Plank)s.
you can explore hidden areas a lot if you just cheat...
As You Lose your Raft often there is an easy Trick to find it in less than a Minute You just swim into The ocean away from The Island Turn you just stop swimming keep refreshing your Pause Menu and when You See an unstuck Button at The top you can Click that and Save you from all The swimming
12:35 hurocane LGIO
Most of the clip : 🫵👍
You got the GrayStillPlays guy vibes 🥰 I like it. Nice job, I thought you were actually going to crash the game 🤣
You violated the game surgically 😂
was this planks "fixed"?
"I didnt realise we were dealing with a Wizard" you mean ANOTHER wizard, mr pop thru walls.
I am playing survival: fountain of youth, and was wondering what kind of crazy builds people have done, but didn't find anyone on YouTube doing anything wild. I thought to myself, I need a letsgameitout play of the game 😅
I just started playing raft and your absolutely hilarious 😂😂😂
It's as if Josh's insanity rivals Jerma (Jeremy) himself
31m views with 15k comments is wild
❤❤Jesus loves you john 3;16 he is salvation from hell no matter what you've done no matter what you've been through Jesus still loves you and will take you back with open arms
I am in awe of this
How much wood did you have to save up for this
bro is not just breaking and changing every game codes and finds bug every games that he play,he is breaking laws of physic in every game that he plays🤣🤣🤣🤣
24:51
ROFLMFAO - OMG - LOLZ !!!!!!!!!!!!!
graystillplays 2.0
BEST one yet HaHa!
0:03 lakers in 5
have you hook the shark?
would give you a like if you played it the way it was meant to be played...
this like if DeSinc played raft lmao
I was so excited to see this and since I’ve seen it, its just what I expected hilarious 😂
Are you sure?🥸
Leave it to him to find out some way to make walking extinct
How to play raft the wrong way
0:31 Come here box  box ii never learned how to swim… 😮
19:22
Boards of Canada
This man and graystillplays have the same shared braincell.        Notice how i said "braincell" not plural
where's the fun in this ?
6:00 i mean the screensaver from the pipes
When he said brute force I thought he meant googling I crackled when it said "5960 tries later" LOL
This video gives me anxiety
29:18 Skyrim reference?
this guy is nutz................................
I always imagined that Josh in real life looked like that weird green guy with the wide open mouth that was bald and incredibly scary. It's what _always_ came to mind. Or else maybe Josh looked like Jack Packard from Red Letter Media. Don't know why - but just saying what imagination told me.  But now at the start of _this_ video, after seeing Josh a few wks ago for 1st time after years of watching, it looks like the real Josh except this one has a dark tan. Amazing how a game he could customize to the end of the earth (making that unholy green abomination with no hair) to a game like this with little to no customization - it instantly shows him as he is in real life. That is so weird.  Video game synchronicity.. no offense to him at all, but I swear when he made that green orc troll monster in another game, it was _exactly_ how I'd always imagined him, identical. Something about his voice conjured up that image of that or Jack Packard. I kind of miss my imagination of him now. It was fun.
If there was a world record for the most perseverance, then Josh would have.
I love the way he says ‘new game’
the tornado !!! HAHAHA so flippin good , and it rotates!!! im crying rn lol
I would do anything to get another part to this series
Its fun watching lets plays by magic man from adventure time.
I have a dumb challenge for you on this game if you want to hear it :b (makes the game raft needlessly difficulty / inificent) tho not sure if it's viable or will run xD
THIS WAS ONE OF MY FAV COD CAMPAIGNS…it is actually pretty fun on hardened instead of normal (but do your thing bro) I’m just saying it is balanced and you can John Wick
8:15 he swam 1633 meters to get back to the boat
The 5 frames where you can see that he has the infirmary key is so good because you know that he swam all the way down to get it after he stole the mayor's key through the window
It’s wild how unfun that game is
He discovers the glitches and exploited them
Te esperamos Co
Bro with my ocd I could not do this I can watch this but if I was playing the game I would not do all of this lol 😂
Rambo and Radioactive Banzai over there angry at all of the invisible people.
This is actually a really good tutorial video for the game. Nice job! Very enjoyable to watch, too!
You are a cheater and you spawn the items in
Real
ReL
The game breaking power of josh and backseat would be immeasurable
the title of this video should be"I completely tore apart the universe by causing the big rip in raft"
23:22
I think the good folks at NASA are begging for this man's computer. For it to continuously render and maintain that monstrosity without catching on fire, it has to be the most powerful PC in existence.
I PUT THE CURSED MOD ON OPRA GX AND ITS SUPER FUNNY
Where's this guy when I code raid
If you can find enough stuff to build radar systems… why not just make a few Semtex pouches and turn the shark into sushi? Or… I don’t know… an outboard motor? There are plenty of useful things you could build. A radar would be the last thing that makes sense on a trash raft.
He had to has used wemod to get unlimited items
Surprised you don't get invited to more Alpha testing.
He has too much time on his hands😂
Can you do car parking multiplayer ❤😊
For me he is a the best game glitch
YOU NEED TO MEET GRAY STILL PLAYS HE IS TECHNICALLY YOU YOULL LOVE HIM I NEED TO SEE YOU COLLAB
Came back to watch this again and still one of my favorite video's done on here.
I've watched this 100 times so I'm just foreshadowing every second lol 😂
what 😮 get out😂
lol if you want the numbers just watch joshs videos to save time
Anyone in 2025…? Anyone…?
31:23 corporal neckbeard xD
I love the determination to get the detail plank as fast as possible because that's when the fun starts! 9 hours of making a tornado raft and breaking and entering with ease. What a gift, it's like the plank was made for him!   Breaking the game without actually rendering it unplayable, Raft has proven itself as a game that Josh can truly game it out!
25:30 miss oportunity to clip through the safe
31:08 Although I gotta admit I don't know where those voices are coming from💯❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.mmm.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
My name is grace. FR
I really hope they don't fix this 😅
How many CPUs has this man burnt through at this point? There is not enough ram on earth to keep up with his shenanigans
Excelent game as intended
2 years
now to get Aloft and try breaking it lol
Pov the game is tired of you (nukes you)
There are a lot of people in the comments willing to perform oral on Josh
There should be a speedrun category called sequencebreak% where you have to see the final boss dissapear
Skeleton key made me laugh
The developers watching josh completely skip the missons and very basis of the entire game as they very angrily fix the board glitch 😂😂
It says 0 likes for me
👈👍 👈👍 👈👍 👈👍
That moment when you pull up on a perfectly good abandoned ship and then leave it to get back on your raft to continue sailing
I use the word awesome very sparingly. This was awesome. Thank you for demonstrating why and how mankind rules this planet and will ultimately destroy it whilst walking across a wooden walkway to mars.
Just to think of the alternate universe where the rugs actually worked amuses me
Every time Josh says “You’re supposed to go this way” I know that’s the last route he’d take😂
29:23: Josh: I love my skeleton key!
4:02 Seize The Day by a7x?
i really h*te his voice
I love his dedication to the insanity
he made around 45 to 60k from this video alone, thats crazy
I thought my screen cracked when we got to snow region
Haha, my family and I laughed ourselves silly watching this.
Lol. . . How funny you are! I just loved it <3
28:45 I thought that was the l4d guy from behind hah.
I remember watching this guy
29:27 WUT DA DOGS DOIN
k
Only up😂
Gg
This was the most unhinged and entertaining thing I've seen since GTA.
Mango mango mango!!
I was actually expecting you to use your plank to head underwater and investigate the room you launched into the ocean.  Guess it will remain a mystery.
Josh, the only crimes happening are the crimes you’re committing against the game 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Your voice is pretty similar to cookie god....
When you have the Magic Planks (TM), you can go anywhere!
E
Breaker of chains 👎  Breaker of games 👍
This video gets me a headache
The door shall never lock
My little sister used this as a tutorial on how to play the game 💀
This is a nautical abomination. I'm appalled. Now I want to get this game.
The amount of people that don't understand.CPU and GPU bottleneck is astounding.
I  DIED AT 12:36 LOL
So,what was my effort😢
The Words That Lead To Armigetten: "Oh what secrets do you have for us"
A classic
I can't believe I only discovered this guy now, he's so funny
The woodnado just looming in the background in some shots is hilarious
the shark is called grace
man. this game is easy😂
I always laugh when i come
0:01 1:00 1:40 2:50 3:10
1:37 Those who know 💀
9:58 👍
josh keeps finding new and creative ways to break games and I love it
4813...
It's hilarious, because when other youtubers do the "9 hours later" its an exageration, but for josh it actually take the amount of time he says it does.
25:30 mf definitely searched it lol
What happens to grace shark?
anyone have extra steam key for this game?
josh and graystillplays would be a better duo than shaggy and scooby-doo, patrick and spongebob, mario and luigi and bert and ernie.
I am it the dentist
02:52 I love this scream he lets out everytime something going against the plan happens. The sound of a psychopath losing control.
😂 that was hilarious!
1:35 Those who know 💀
Play goat simulator 3
24:18 lol at this point as he looked up i fr thought he was in the backrooms 😂😂😂😂😂
The few people I believe when he says it took hours.
You can make a boat or cruise ship
This is finally on console
Raft is finally on playstation but idk if THIS is possible😂 hopefully...
Huge issue when watching this video. It was completely unwatchable until I muted it. Then it was just fine.  Please fix the narrator. Or if you want to keep the cheesy narration, add more clown honks and whistles sounds to add to the existing aura.
Xou cheadet
one piece carpenter devil fruit simulater
Josh did good at explaining raft
How is this 2 years old already
We should all vote for him as president and just see what happens
"brute force"
Josh: Get back here, crate! You're not getting away that easily!  [Grace has logged in]
MY THASALAPHOBIA JUST KICKED IN 😭😭😭😭😭 0:48
surely he using wemod
Attention span is over 900000000
The most impressive is that bro always had wood on him
Wow. This game aged badly. Forgot it even existed...
25:19  Ok but💀
Gigantic wooden Mcflurry.
I only got four hours of sleep on a school night cause of this and it was totally worth it
You had me laughing so freaking much!!!
Josh I have a good idea for you you should do a collab with graystillplays
I praise your thinking outside the box sir, I would tried to build a battleship of sorts, but what is that in comparison to a floating wooden tornado with ever reaching tentacles 😂😂😂
0:27 Then pick me up
Remember everyone: Good live, Come laugh, Who float sail?

If Josh ever got super speed every one would be in danger
0:16 “that’s right. just a few.” Proceeds to literally make a web out of zip-lines
What happened to Grace 😭😭😭
What a joke of a game. The video is awesome though. That sarcasm. Priceless.
When he says “is there a limit?” Or “just give me a minute” you know something insane will happen
I just got a bug testing ad right before this….think raft might need this.
Josh is a war criminal in many games and he knows it He's proud of it I can tell
Im in 2years now! 1:12  try upload new please , review cirisx or revival earth
How did he have so much wood I’m so confused
You joke like a sarcastic 15 year old girl who's bored with her school word and feels the need to express with all her peers just how much fun she's not having
Fantastic.  Words cannot express how Legendary this playthrough is
is this a play through or tutorial???
Josh is the best🎉
2024 to 2025  👇
You basically showed us how to unlock the best ending of this game. 😂 That was amazing.
🤣🤣🤣🤣

I thought the title was clickbait, but I was wrong.
23:22 Netflix: Are you still watching? Someones son:
21:20  let me say it for you “your fine “
theoretically could you do wood tendrils from one island to an entirely different one?
"Shenanigans" is the only way to describe this
29:07 Cutest laugh
The whole underwater exploring bit with the shocking jellyfish and the lightbulb parts actually would have been so challenging tho. If you didn't have the wood plank bridge. Like that seems pretty difficult. I haven't gotten that far in the game yet myself.
Bro had a vision abt mango phonk
“I’ll just take the board express thank you very much” i was dead after this 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hilarious
"brakes leg" ohh your  fiiiiiiiiiine  lol
Bruh you destroy the laws of physics💀

Gander is actually a city in newfoundland
JUST SAYING JOSH YOUR MY FAVERATE YOUTUBER EVER TO EXSIST
This mf makes clickbait videos
how was this 2 years ago
lmaoo tornado raft
Bahahahaha… said me not one time watching this. I didn’t laugh once. I honestly don’t understand how this guy has that many subscribers. All his jokes are bad, not like funny bad, like just awful not funny. Plus he sounds like Ben Stein, such a boring voice. With that said, this is cool, just couldn’t watch this guy longer than 2 minutes but I skipped through.
Planks are OP
i feel like olaf is the normal one compared to josh-

This is absolutly diabolical
The String lights are beautiful I must say
😂😂😂🦈 2:54
Bro just completed the game with pointing his finger 😂😂😂
you KNOW it's bad when josh says "That's too far."
Its all Magical!
16:56 me and my friend (mostly me) also discovered if you are above a plank in the middle of the ocean and surface jumping will turn gravity on and physics off and pull you down to the plank ( it can also happen but you miss than goodbye life)
25:31 you can go into 3rd person and clip your camera into the safe thus grabbing the key found that out day 1
I used to love your channel ever since I got a new iPad, I was never able to find it until now❤😢
"Tom there's a fire on PC 3 Aisle 7"
Take a breath bro. Your editing style makes it so we hear nothing but your voice nonstop for the entire duration of the video and its a bit too much.
The fact that u spent so many hours doing all of that just for a 30 min youtube video is crazy! Good video love it
This guy And gray need to make a video together
Bruh wtf
Raftnado
no
All the game designers had to do was put limitations on the number of board extensions and 60% of this video would have been completely different.

I think this video is unironicly an important part of my character development
"Behold the Selene Dion key" 25:34
This guy seems like the most insufferable form of sociopathic autism. In another life he’d be a stock broker or business CFO.
The part when he glitches in The  door and says “ahh~, and we’re in” (not to mention the “plop” sound he added when it glitched) I CANT🤣
The Algorithm just gifted me with this gem.
5:99 and 6:00 are just wild themes💀

05:98  See for your
5:98 HE MADE “THE SIGN”
You, my friend, are wonderful at this. I laughed so hard M&Ms fell out of my mouth.
You and @Imcade are my favorite YouTubers
What a bug !! Oops 🙊
Idk but you is Pagoda destroys the game
29:08 if you can hear Josh's uncontrolled laughs you know the video is funny
My imagined version of Josh's wedding reception is string lights and zip lines.

Fallout 5: Lost at Sea
It’s so funny lol
THIS IS JS HILARIOUS WIJSIAJWKWKSKAIJWJSJS SBAHAHAHAHHAHAHASHHAHAH😭

Me who just gotbto know that raft is a story based game
Josh vs Jacob's ladder 💀
Forbidden espresso xd
Hi
Who runs barter town? Planks, lots of them.
how did the game not crash
The amount of dedication required to abuse the plank in this game is impressing ... would love to see the reaction of the devs to this clip LOL.
I can’t believe Josh doesn’t crack up while doing this nonsense 😂😂😂😂😂
Ah,yes.the Tornado raft.
"Forbidden espresso" 😭😭😭
27:34 HE DIDNT SAY “YOU’RE FINE”
How the hell am I supposed to think that it was that simple to collect all that wood
who's watching in 2024?
i feel like josh is just bill cipher but if he was human and decided to start a gaming channel.
I know people might of been offended but, I like the "Grace The Shark" other than "Shark Friend"...
Me: "How tf are you not starving?? 😭" Josh: "S T R I N G   L I G H T S" Me: "Understandable, have a nice day"
15:30
this guy broke all the rules in this game lol .....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hi i love you
2:53 dang I would have raged
Blud realy destroyed the last boss battle
10:38 Love how you give zero effort reading that word correctly 😂😂😂😂
I would have done  the same stuff.😂
Ropa mania
If you place down a chair and sit in it, it will clip you through walls.
I dont know why, but i think we need more cosmetics for your raft in raft. Like IKEA Blåhaj.
Josh's favourite activity is to break a game as quick as he can.
Those people are new characters
As someone who has never played the game I now fully understand EVERYTHING about the game.........except for one thing.  Why is the game named "Raft" instead of "Ramp?"
I feel like the planks are the equivalent to just smashing windows open instead of finding a key. Also could this technically be used for speed running? I mean..he’s not cheating, the devs put that item in for a reason.
I have Grace 😂😂😂😂
If grey still plays teamed up with this guy, it would be the end of the world
I dont know why i like this D Damn Episode so Mutch, iv'e Watched it 3-4 times before now, and now i,m gonna watch it again
Buddy is graystillplays' doppelganger
19:23 lol
p
i wonder why josh didnt call the shark grace is it a dif one if so wheres grace? 0_0
Wondering where Anthony is now
23:00 bro gave some fictional shark pronouns 💀
6:27 that’s actually really pretty like I would go on a raft if it looked like that
Who else thinks this is amazing?
Man I love when my favorite youtubers break games with boards
imagine boarding a plane and the pilot says into the mic: “hey there it’s josh welcome back to let’s game it out”
he sounds like kevin spacey
Like... very much
I can't be the only one who hears Draegast when Josh talks... Right?
Is pit stop in f1
OMG Impressive jaja 💀 ❤️  Laugh from Nagoya, Japan 🇯🇵 ❤️
Hey Josh you can define physics with rugs!
Let’s Game It Out vs GrayStillPlays would be a legendary Battle
Whenever josh says “oh boy!” You know he’s gonna break the game,make NPCs float,and curse a town with a curse where they have to barf eternally
Bro built that thing to hold him stuff and the shark was like “…..RARARARARAR”
your a wizard hairy im a what a wizard! hairest potter
Makes me think of Iceman for some reason lol
Devs if you make a game give the key to LGIO and he’ll find every single bug (and then some)
you did nt brute force the code you just got it on the wiki
1:10 Dying me of Laugher🤣🤣🤣
We would not get a 32 minute video with 28M views if Josh didn’t aim that one plank into the sky.
I love you very much ❤❤❤
bro is a walking bug finder
"This is what it sounds like, when devs cry"

Bros PC is the only thing in the entire universe that can face off against Doomguy and have a chance
30:47 “ok that didnt sound like someone who died the way we want them to” got me rolling😂
Not josh taking hours of time to brute force the code in temperance rather then taking a couple of minutes😂
Josh your beautifuly insane
B-but how did he get vine goo and metal befire a smelter 😢
day one of saying day one on youtubers videos
😂😂😂😂
You are the funniest YouTube streamer ever
Cheating in resources without saying your cheating in resources is meh. Glitching is funny though
Your videos are fun
You broke YouTube because the red line representing how much time I watched is on the bottom even though I got the small square not the fullscreen😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t think the people o raft should be concerned about the water drowning them they should be concerned about josh filling the earth with stuff he found a way to conquer the sky and land so nowhere is safe
Reminds me of the Silver Surfer.
I cant believe this video is already over a year old
THIS VIDEO LITERALLY CRASHED YOUTUBE WHEN I CLICKED IT!
He said LIKE SO the most out of any word
20:00 and can’t forget that we learned how to breathe underwater forever
The Celine Dion reasearch facility. Me: “my heart will go on and oooonnnnn!!!!”
Door: *exists* Josh: “I don’t think I will.”
you might need help.
lol
The funniest thing is I’m watching this on the toilet 4:36😂😂😂😂
step 1: make a hilariously funny introduction step 2: do an ungodly amount of beginner stuff and get a "minor headstart" step 3: progress as far as you can without getting anything else step 4: actually progress step 5: find an ungodly bug step 6: brute force through everything with the bug step 7: spend 100 hours doing insane things and depriving your sanity of existence step 8: blow everything up congrats, you have created insanity
Still an amazing play trough 😂
This man is my childhood favortite youtuder your video is great👍
idea: make a whole island out of boards as your raft
I completely broke your brain with one game on lore; Kingdom Hearts. (i should probably stop making these jokes)
What item ?
Josh reminds me of Gray beautiful
"looks like these blocks are trying to spell hell oh well" -Josh
Good
i like the part where he was bridging
raft but he never adds space
graystillplays is better
i would love to see his steam hours on this game and others
josh is the perfect playtester if you want to know if your game has bugs
whos here from 2024
"And shes buying the plankway to heaven."
24:50
from vegetarian to boba island to tangerine. what a wonderful game
999+ missed calls from Issac newton
in let’s game it out logic this should definitely be considered a hate crime 2:54
"I'll be right back" Josh says, with the same air as a minecraft youtuber doing some "mining offscreen" and coming back with several hundred chests worth of diamonds and gold
should have the pawning with the dunko duck since its $52
29:03 noo wayyy !!!!  After years of watching all his videos, that's the first time i heard josh laughing
Josh would be such a good person for the developers to let play their games to find and patch glitches.
watching this n opera gx lets game it out mod!
normal people: lets do this all right josh: who needs to do things right DETAIL PLANK GO
5:56 galvanized square steel and eco friendly wood veneers
Alll you need is Woood! WOood is all y need. Allll together now!! Alll need is Wood Everybody ALLLL YOU NEED IS WOOOD!!
pov speed running a game by useing glitches to make the game devs suffer trying to fix lets game it out in a nut shell
15:03 hawii part ii ??????
I'm surprised that Josh hasn't used the detail boards to spell "run" yet
Somehow I find listening to lets game it out helps me sleep
Make a raft that is so tall you can’t even see the water
Panic at the Disco!: “We built this house on memories”  Josh: “We built this tornado-raft with memories”
Violations of the Geneva Conventions is why I enjoy Josh’s content 😃
11:49 give me a fev minutes "9 hours later"
Poor Grace, Josh forgot the shark has a name
How big of an attention span do you have??
Josh is the perfect bug hunter in sandbox games. Change my mind.
1:00:00
crazy
Dream island Be like
Me when I noticed I wasn’t subscribed
Broo really
Did he really just count up until he found the right combination my guy is dedicated
Josh would LOVE brick rigs but it might be too complicated
i wonder what josh's full videos look like and how much he edited out
Warum die deutsche Nationalhymne ? 😂
This was incredibly magnificent 👏 I loved every minute of it! The tornado mind blowing and then the planks man freaking phenomenal but then the glitch through the rooms with the planks I was glued to the screen the entire video I really loved 😍 it , thank you for sharing it with us 🙏
27:08 Am I the only person who thought of The Promised Neverland
Pls shoutout t my friend Millisd
The boat reminds me of a wither storm from Minecraft story mode
Whar the heck how does palm leaves / tree gives mango 🥭
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂👻👻👻👻
I imagine the dev watching this and be like “wait wait no that’s not how you do that what are you doing?”
Its not broken its perfection.
Just a few zip lines to josh is about 1,000,000
Dude, this raft in the middle of the ocean is a better setup than my apartment
i thought the lights accidentally spelled “Help you FU-“
Great video I was intrigued the entire way!
Josh is just a gamer that has a hobby at breaking every single game he plays
He accidentally speed ran the game
Call the shark grace Let's game it out
Bro doesn't call grace anymore, call him grace.
3:41 wow behind seens if you look you kan see that he is standing on a raft that is not conected to the raft
yach
Its just a digital Hallucination
Final cwaper
Final cwaper
31:47 the weirdest sentence ever
26:21 nuclear scientist, ca. 1986
You and graystillsplay should collab
25:23 the codes are in josh mind
... Is the tornado an omage to satisfactory
I have a bone to pick with you
11:34 So you attach one end, always a strong start
my first thought was not "whats will he do to day" it was "how is he going to beat the game brute forcing things today"
A guy at work put this channel on in one of the rooms (we are allowed to play music off youtube) and now im addicted and will never forgive him.
This guy makes this game look too easy🥲 but in a the good way
The developers of raft watching this to find more bugs to patch 💀🔫
Zoo a a fun cute game with animals😂
Let's Game It Out!!!!!!!!!!
ur voice so nice it help me to fall asleep
I think this is the first time that Josh is doing a proper speed run
RAFT MORE LIKE DRAFT.... LETS GET DRAFTED INTO RAID SHADOW LEGENDS - San tizu the art of war... HAHAHA US MILLITARY LOL
Other people :walking 567,345,489,000 times a day Josh:walks 3 times a day😂
I fell asleep watching this no joke
To speedrunners of this game you must either appear to them to be a god or a mad man, absolutely no in-between XD
Who else is rewatching rn
Ok I never heard of your channel before and never heard of the game as a whole but  I've never laugh that hard for so long in my entire life
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮❤😮❤😮😮❤😮❤😮❤😮❤😮❤😮❤😢❤😢🎉❤🎉❤😢❤😢❤😢😂😢😂😮😂😮😂😅😂😅😂😮❤😢❤😢❤😢❤😢❤😮😂😅😂😮😂🎉😮😢😂😢😂😢❤😢❤😮🎉😅😅😂
How does bro have that much wood??????
A
I want to see the dev's reaction videos!
So scary, guy went on you with endless desk road and no wall not door, no radiation, bomb, nothing can't stop him. And you don't know he will be to do
Dear gosh, josh has the most feminine mock "huegh!!!" I have ever heard. It is as impressive as it is creepy.
GRAAAAAAAAACCCCEEEEEEE!!!!!
No one: Literally not a single person on earth: Josh: *sarcasms Intensely*
imagine the devs looking at this and going like "oh well time to delay the game for another year"
Is josh modding or does he havean inhumane amount of patience😂
Josh sounds like Adam from north of the border
meh
"can I just put it along the edge like this? you sure can! And can you walk on it? You sure can't!" loll 🤣
LOL!!!!!!
Your fine..
17:59
Bro made the most boring game ever look like fun.
Josh+gray=choas
Josh: *Doing literally anything his twisted mind can dream up* The Devs: Write that down, write that down!
make this the top comment (just for fun)
Love it
Where’s grace!
i'm lazy😅😑🤭😜
🍣🍣🍣🎂🥟🍙🍚🍜🍝🤤
Josh: the "do it yourself" husband from hell...
I think pretty much any game will get PTSD when they hear the music from these vids
game bro
The best QA tester in videogame industry.
Accidentally backing out of a window is a pretty natural reaction to seeing the God of Planks build his way down a hall at you.
Your raft is an inspiration that outshines anything the developers came up with. You are the nihilist god.
Is this a good game? It looks like a first person Sims Castaway but with rafts 😂
If I have nothing else specifically lined up, you have been my favorite to fall asleep to. I can't tell you how many times I've played this for sleep. Weird? Maybe.....but it is what it is.
You should collaborate with Graystillplays. I think you could get a bunch of views if you collaborate with him.
🧌
bro's patience level is next level
how lazy are you? Josh: Yes
I thought the antennas were rockets😂😂
Bro said unknown espresso 😂😂😂
At this point, this guy has a radio and has found other people. He doesn't _want_ to be rescued.
Imagine being the guy who programmed walls in the game and seeing this
And now I know why Valheim had to add a structural integrity system
Life before Isac newton
Infinite cRaft-ing simulator... This video broke me with laughter XD
Love how he finished the game with the mangoes he got at the very start when he cut down the tree
Another title for thid video: how to hack and speedrun raft
my army will crush you! i bet they will XD 31:39

@hugo
He's a wizard - he can teleport _and_ bi-locate!
I love this guys laugh
Before I completed Raft, this video seemed fun and interesting to me, after I completed Raft, I decided to watch it again, but now every minute in my head, - “Way what? Wtf is goin on..”
Playing the game right are you on drugs
2nd to the write strate til morning is a peter pan the first one out of three or to some pepole say 1st or 2nd
me at the start of the video: i havent heard of the game, but it seems kinda like subnautica.... actually no, i shouldnt jump to that conclusion just because it's another water-based game  me after the detail plank gets unlocked: ah,
Yay now I have "Hey there It's Josh :D" Every time I open a new tab
I honestly lost a brain cell watching half of this.
That was funny!
What would happen if you places board under the water then place a bottom block on the board would it lift everything up?

What's rly funny is the Josh never just brute forced any of the coordinates for the places lmao
Alternate title :  how to make raft devs cry
i like to think that he just says this entire video with one breath, cause there are SO many cuts inbetween sentences, you cant hear him breathe in XD
God: how much patience do you want when youre born Josh: *_ALL OF IT_*
i wonder how many time he used to create that tornado hurricane🤣🤣🤣🤣
MIKU MIKU YOU SHOULD PLAY MY GAME IT IS ON ROOLBLOX
WHAT
WHAT DO YOU GET YOUR GAMES OFF?
I feel like Josh and @Graystillplays would be best friends.
This is actually amazing!
Dude just casually playing fortnite in raft
Oblivion paint brush👍
Code = 2011
Blue haired people everywhere with a pet white dog
I love Hilda because I hate my brain
you re crazy. jesus
Amazing :3
10:38 "Vasagatan"! That's a common name for streets in Sweden 🤨
When do you not break the game?
I didn't realise it was going to be a Heist Movie!😊
Is Balboa Rocky?
He would be so happy if they made a torture simulator
jkll
Why do you sound like that bro
Are you vox from hazbin hotel
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 awesome
HE DID IT, BOYS, HE FOUND IT THE G SPOT
Typical
the end is so funny
imagine being locked in a house, and the person who saves you arives on 99 billion miles of boards connected to a tornado that isn't very physics
Could have used a bed for the dome
Stranger vanishes in front of our eyes. "I didn't know we were dealing with a wizard." - Proceeds with defying all known limitations of physics himself.
That raft looks like a wither storm, am I the only one who thinks so?
the tornado raft i beautiful
Dundundun da da dun pa pa pa sounds very reasonable
i love how he says about the rug said can you walk on it  "sure can" but there is a t and when he threw the rock when the shark was eating the bait
Bro thinks he is franky and chopper combo
Come with me, and you’ll be, in a world that hurts your Imagination! Take a look, and you’ll see, into your broken imagination!We’ll begin with caution, traveling in a world of my creation! What you’ll see will need an explanation! If you want to view chaos, simply watch this vid and view it! Anything you want to, see it! Want to change the world? Then beat him to it!
hu
This is awsome
Camera man still surviving on the raft episodes:
Ps wtf u get all the wood? Lol I didn't see any forests in game haha
This games like subnautica and stranding deep had a baby hehe. Its a bigger version of stranded deep this game has some interesting features is this single player only? Or local coop or coop? Mp?
raft is awesome
Josh vasagatan is a block and it’s not vegetarian
its the final brain cell XD
lmao i hope you leave the planks on and float around
The patience Josh has for 10 second ridiculous clips 😂
dante infero looking raft at the start
His ram has ram
Play Bendy and ink machine
I felt so much pain seeing the shark collapse that tower of chests
How are you so calm
Your videos make me smile and laugh your videos. Make me smile laugh. I hope you have great days. It was happy to see people late
The thing is, this requires so much set-up and so many resources and is just way too funny, that there's really no reason to patch any of that.
What if you can collect all the people and build an entire army on your raft? That would seem pretty normal, just some casual slavery!
AYO CHAD "PLAY2WIN" BROSKI!!!!
Josh is just better graystillplayz
The only YouTuber I never have to skip 10 seconds
The master of chaos
Imagine cheating
Biblically accurate raft 👌
You would make millions if you let people hire you for bug testing for games.
Bro this is a literal masterpiece one of your iconic videos for sure got the views and likes to prove it
when something he makes is not entiraly bad
Where is shylilys reaction to this video
Feed the shark so it learns that the raft is a source of food. Surely this will work out fine.
IT SPELLS HELP ME! ]: 12:15
This is what happens when you have too much free time.
collected 17 gifts but did not increase his amount of other resources... I investigate all the raw materials including those that I have not yet collected and needed to "melt" Clearly you use an editor to do these things...
Mmm enjoy being distracted  😊
i watched it when i was a 6-year-old
GrayStillPlays is a YouTuber
Bro always plays the game as the devs meant to. Much respect.
People that are watching in 2023
Is he probably cheating? Yes. Do I care? Absolutely not. Is he hurting anyone by cheating in a SINGLE PLAYER GAME? No So hush and let me enjoy the funny insanity people
I did not expect to laugh so hard at a game I did not know existed. Well done! 😂
Hes like the silver surfer of carpentry.
This made me laugh sofaking hard. Merry Christmas, dude.
Thumbnail looks like a fortnite screenshot or some ahit
This could've been titled "The evolution of the Nerd Pole"
Every game josh plays becomes a challenger in the ability to withstand his slideshow making antics, yet somehow, this is one of the first to succeed
screen saver from 20 years ago (now 21) really got me.
This game looks so boring
Ocean and tornado fact: tornados on water are called "waterspouts" not A tornado.
Dude cracks me the f up.
3:55
All Board!!
Whats the point?
Josh-E
Very comical! I really hope they dont change the mechanics of that extendable board! I love games that let you do what you want. If you figure out a different way to do something, then sure, please allow the player to continue doing it.
See, Josh this is why I subscribed to you. 😀👍
Oh boy It's time for some raaaaffffft! Oh the fun we've had with this game!
this this byfar one of his best vids and i keep coming back to watch it
You can make a spear to hit the shark from breaking your raft lol.
Oh wait, so the devs actually removed this plank becoz of this? good job Josh
😂Lol.  Jessss😅
So true
Check out gray still plays
Let’s game it out would be a really good game tester if he’s this crazy
😊😊
THANKYOU I LAUGHED WHICH IS RARE AS MOST GAME PLAYERS AR E VIOD OF INTELLIGENCE
I like how this guy finds out how to break and make crazy stuff every single game he runs into
This guy goodbeard said that’s illegal
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I ALMOST FORGOT BOUT U IM SOO SORRY U WERE SOO FUNNY
wow you're annoying
26:26 LoL 😩
I got so board watching this.
Wondering if this has been fixed already… 😂😂😂
bro really did pacifist run on raft
Make another raft video but you just make a giant staircase
'Flesh wound or not I need this rock.'
Screensaver from 20 years ago. I like that one
Josh: just give me couple minutes.... 9 Hour later.... lol
the Christmas tree raft 😅
How long does the shark battery work
josh like :how i can  stop tiki team from saving their islands     a raft tornado that make people hearth attack
I’m new
Josh never fails to make me laugh 😂😂😂
This video is old and gold, i can always watch this when i want
damm i love this game,, i played with my friends ,,we adventure from nothing to something..what a game..
"give me a few minutes" 9 hours later..
I keep thinking his TORNADOS HORRIFYING TENDRILS are cracks and hairs on my screen
TORNADO RAFT WTF 😭😭😭💜
The more I watch Let's Game It Out the more I hear Caleb Linden's voice from Big Mouth on Netflix
@letsgameitout do another raft video
True gamer
You know i kinda want the board express to be real😂
Gosh josh is the only person in their right mind to make a whole channel to just make the developers have an midlife crisis and make every npc would wrather be in a sumulater of the titanic
I low key wanna see him and a speed runner try to beat raft with some random challenge like (build a 10000 x 10000 raft)
Loved it.
nah because if that shark came and got rid off all that including the storage i wouldnt react calm like josh instead that shark is going to be in PAIN for the rest of the game
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Just normal Josh things.
I like to imagine to everyone else Josh just looks like Cthulhu
1 year later and this video is still funny and entertaining
Josh literally every time he breaks his ankles: "Ehhh You'll be fineee."
I have like 60 channels subbed, but just to make LGIO special, I somehow did something to sub twice on one channel. Just the way Josh would like it. Also, I have no clue how i did it, so don’t like interrogate me to how.
19:21 rip
Hahahahahahaahahaha!
this is my most liked channel
Doors exists, Josh- “so I took that personally”
I just watched half an hour of a YouTuber I never watched humorously exploit a game I never played on a Friday night.
Aw man no more raft means- wait no I forgot being a menace is a full time job. HOW MUCH DOES IT PAY?!
if he say 15 hour , he mean it
How to speed run raft
I cannot help but imagine this character not as a person who's using a glitch, but rather some kind of terrifying cryptid that just floats through space, leaving a trail of horrifying wooden planks as it goes like some kind of monstrous spiderweb. And that poor guy at the end is trying desperately to survive but no matter how many traps or locked doors he puts in it's way, it just melds through the building and oozes it's way closer.
Josh is the perfect bug finder
😨
Detail plank = God
😂😂😂🎉
Raft is now on mobile🎉
6:08 Only up be like:
He said 2 not 4 >:(
Why is graystillplays not your friend!?
He did keep the raft small tho
Josh: has literally anything God: *Oh no*
Do these glitches still work? or did they fix this stuff lmao
Ah yes that one moment when you implement a design element to the game and a random player just skips every cutscene and task you’ve been working on hard using it
How long do these videos take?! So much building/bridging, farming, etc.
I didn't know Josh could preforms Franky's Skywalk
I didn't know Josh could preforms Frankys Skywalk
JOSH WHERE DID THE PIZZ GO
Josh just grinds hard for the wrong way that is skipping majority of this
One of these days a dev is going to give Josh a key and a keypad and set the password to 9999 out of spite
Idea : capture the shark
Me before seeing this video to help me rob(joke) bedrooms: be VERY sneaky... Me when I saw this video: this will help! Me robbing(joke) another bedroom after seeing this video: *being AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE AND STILL SUCCEEDING IN THE ROBBERIES I DID*
Has a dev of this game we are working on this glitch
😂 that is hilarious about utopia & the raft tornado 🌪️
I love how he spends hours doing completely unnecessary things and then proceeds to glitch into every building he can because he doesn’t want to spend the time to unlock it
31:40 HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN
I know its an old video, but can you make a raft video building a submarine with that underwater glitch?
lol I am eating SPICEY chips and then I had to take a massive 💩 but I just brought my phone with me lol
Next time you should brute force all the island codes
It would take you more time doing it legitimately at the start of the game to farm those items and do some of these exploits than actually doing it the way devs intended It's unlikely for you to have 80 cubes at start of the game without any nets on the raft, it takes a lot of materials and 3 min to just craft a single one. So it's a long time of not just crafting but much more of just farming the materials and you wouldn't wanna do it by just using the hook. Not really practical considering the game design and definitely something all devs should consider.
you’re a genius 😂
30분 내내 처웃었네 씨벌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
man i just laugh at his 48 hours of time and i laugh ALOT it makes me spit out my water every time
josh would be a great bug finder for games
wow you acculy speedrun this game only use wood
propably the best video on your channel and one of the best of all time
Personally raft was better without people
I swear sometimes this guy sounds like Cleavelend from family guy
Hearing "You're fine " after every body-smashing fall, makes me fear heights even more
And people say games aren’t good for you, with out it, this psychopath would be let out in the real world
🐟
I remeber when i us3d to watch this guy
hurricane lets game it out
What about the snowmobiles?
i saved this video for my girlfriend to watch for when we were done playing Raft so that when she watched it she would have the proper perspective, she was iffy about watching it because she was having a really bad day but it completely cheered her up and made her laugh. Thanks for that.
Josh can’t go to jail for the Red Cross war crime he accidentally committed. He can bring his planks and clip through the cell wall as till he gets back home.
👍
Josh:Learn learn learn learn learn learn learn then all  of a sudden be well educated
I’ve watched this video at least 7 times ever since it was released, it’s def my favourite video on youtube
vasagatan can be cleared even faster if you just jump up to the top of the ship and go in third person you can just grab the note and blueprint through the wall
YOU are a total NUT, and you're very funny.
imagine being an overlord of an island population and a god descends upon you with planks, intangibility and his planknado
😂😂😂😂ur the best
I'm watching this for like the third time
You unlock mode (peacefull+lol)
I love how josh has gotten so powerful he dosnt need to use a door nor physics😂😂
I think Minecraft’s the only game not afraid of Josh’s patience.
Y’all this man drives himself insane for our entertainment
By the end of the video, it looked like Emrakul came to life
6:01 is just a roblox obby
How did your game not crash
Average gpo player 😅😂😂😂
Ah amazing
6:16 Josh predicted Only Up
Josh is like the macgyver of gaming no matter what is placed in the palm of his hands he can make an abomination out of it.
the laugh at 29:08 just cracks me up
This is the most hilarious thing I've watched in a long time 😂
He sounds like Noah from total drama island
Favourite vid so far, I've watched it a million times
i love when someone breaking the game
O😊
Little did he know he just gave a massive gift to speed runners
whenever he says "Just give me a minute" it takes more then a minute
you have to do more raft video's
The raft: I AM THE STORM THAT IS APPROACHING
Note to self. Watching let's game it out while eating is a choking hazard 😂
homie is smurfing in raft
How did Josh manage to break a game with a plank? I think we’re dealing with a genius madman here, folks.
Josh is a god of disaster who is more powerfuller than all gods with his abilitys beyond comprehension
Bro has way to much time on his hands
They probably let this man play a game for free to find every bug that there is so they can fix it.
People make me sad. He in no way says he does of the rip, but if you watch his content he's shown he's more than capable of "fast farming" so it evens out.   P.S. Learn to enjoy things from time to time. Not everything needs MatPated.
lol "come laugh." gross
2:27 You know I think we'd all be amazed, but for Lets game it out.. Not so much.
hi i just made my acc
I can imagine the devs watching this either cursing their lazy decisions or just trying very hard not to cry. Anyway, thanks for all the good laughs, Josh.
This is so funny
Min: 6:01 Oh only up in raft
This is the only one that josh that i know what will he want to do being kicked out and breaking the rules and get banned
Dear god have mercy i hope you didn't actually brute force a four digit pin
Did he get the machete? Or no
Detail plank? More like eldritch horror plank lol
Whenever you hear Josh say; “Let me give you the grand tour.” You know you’re about to see nightmares beyond comprehension.
Can someone who speaks Spanish translate this for me? Hola, soy Jeffery Mc. Tonto, y yo, hemos cometido varios actos de fraude fiscal, también he sido condenado por múltiples cargos de asalto agravado, una vez golpeé intencionalmente a tres mujeres embarazadas con coche y motor, también cometí un crimen conocido como "enjugar el inodoro de Taco Bell", todos sabemos que tirar de la cadena del inodoro de Taco Bell conduce a un arresto, y lo siento, por los crímenes que he cometido, y los crímenes, aún no los he cometido
No.
i guess RAFT developers gave up on this game and other game development after seeing what u have done to this game...... LOL and the only key he used in whole game
You are every game developers worst nightmare.
Bro is the master of floor is lava
28:47 I NEED MORE BOULLETS
the tornado is so big it has a constelation
offbrand but still good graystillplays
It seems you can go as far as you want with the boards, have you tried to just anchor the raft at the beginning and then make a "bridge" taking you all through the game without ever really sailing?
i need a horror comic about being controlled by josh
i can't tell if he is being sarcastic the entire video
I nominate you for the "most normal person named josh" awards of 2023
This mf cringe asf
why is every one of his videos funny?
Huh? Good raft!
A few minutes…The screen says 9 hours later
Bro, why under this vid does it say breaking news?
Bro can break a game with cheese.
Congratulations, you just lagged the game.
I've never seen someone so effectively circumvent an entire game before, this has been a treat
Hey young hey let's game it out what about you play blood box
Has the title changed?
This is hilarious 😂
Graystillplays + Dakblake = Lets game it out
true?
"Uhahahaha! I didn't realize we were dealing with a wizard." Lets Game It Out 2022
“Good live, come laugh, who float sail.” -Josh 2022
me after seeing the tendrils: THE RAFT HUNGERS. THE RAFT DEMANDS JOSH TO EXPAND. THE RAFT WILL CONSUME THE WORLD.
this is important art.
I guess this guy always wanted to be SilverSurfer 😄
The tornado has claimed another victom
When I ever play rap I am doing the same thing😂
The first let’s game it out video I’ve ever watched is a year old now
Brown surfer
Nice ❤❤❤
So we meet once again Grace🦈
you"re not a gamer you are a psychopath 😂
Bros in ohio
In this video you invented like 10 speedrun tactics lol. This is one of the most you videos on the channel. Awesome
日本人で見てる方おる？(英語は分からん)
Combine all the rafts youve made
17:00 *chef kiss*
Ahh yes the one person who makes everything a misery to play
Bro really said 🌪️
Josh be like when he cant glitch into a wall or break a game: My dissapointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined
why does it actually look good with the string lights-
18:59 why isnt she wearing shoes
11:57 I see where this is going
Josh supplies no I hate supplies lol ahead but then we’re not dumb😮
The patience this guy have is crazy
We have plank tornado coming
"oh god, do i need to care?" same josh, same
Josh; argh oiwchi 😂 0:51
He so chill but hilarious 💀
He’s building straight to heaven, why is his raft not called tornado of babel
Bro I've played this do you know how long the bits take to make this man has no life
parkour
Cheese
The no logic man.
Bro is braking the game and pssting out the game.
I can say that this game sucks on mobile
11:55 give me a few minutes (9 hours later)
Hi
Josh could be following you on a plank. Just watching over you from a board at all times.
Hey what is the place do you remember when you made the Patamon sing well so am I give you some mercy this time and give you a thumbs up I have a phone still on but since I watched a Batman video I love you. Wireless IKEA video
HAHAHAHAHA im so done 😭😂
Isnt it weird he had bolts and vineboo before having the smelter
We're did you get your slelitn key
How much wood does he have to make all those planks-😮
this is setting me off so it must be the perfect lets game it out video
2:56 that’s why we can’t have nice things
This is my first time watching a Raft playthrough and it has successfully convinced me that it's an easy, fun game
Help me 🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢😭😓😢😢😓😭😓😢😓😭😢😢😓🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮😢😓🤮🤢🤮😭😓😢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😓😓😢😢😢😢😓😓😢😓😓😓😢😢😢😢😓😓😢😢😢😓😓😢🤣😢😓😓😭😓😢😓😭😭🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤢🤮🤢
Balboa is an Captain Alatriste (Spanish novel) reference, Alatriste’s companion is named Rodrigo Balboa
20:56  the alternative to ‘highway to hell’ by AC/DC
17:55 that sums it up perfectly  Funniest gaming channel ever, laughing so hard for years now 😂
Imagine being chased by a man on a giant board constantly creating more boards poking you with a stick with a rock at the end
“Ok what do I have. Reactor malfunction? Oh god do I need to care?” Never change Josh
To josh infinite is the same as just a few
nice game
13:15 he sounds as cocky as Bill Cypher
Josh sounds like grey still plays ngl
Awesome video!
Where did you get all those planks
6:01 bro created the level from only up
W
Ok the part where it says 2011 for coordinates that was my birth year from Aeros 😮❤😂🎉
How does he not die from starvation or fall damage
this here is the most dedicated man, and the best video I’ve ever scene…
gteayt
I love this game!
Josh is the guy who sees a door and says "how about no" and proceeds to make the devs regret their decision of making the game.
2 mins into the video and I'm already hit the subscribe button
I've never had more fun watching a game than I did 1 minute ago
I'll never forget what I learned "Good live Come laugh Who float sail"
I told myself that was the last video but then I saw one of joshes and said  Screw it
He's literaly THE PLATE MAN, "i can be Anywere if i only want!"
Raft is really just watery don't starve
YOU BROCK THE GAME 😱😱😱
I watch all of your videos no matter how long they are make a very big one and I’ll watch it😂
This is lit hahaha
Dude is sailing the high seas with the SS Emrakul.
You ruined the game for us
"locked doors" the game
That was special
24:52 bro thought no one can reach it except him, i can reach anywhere, more places than you.
24:21 right after bro said “eh your fine” then do it irl yourself
20:57 ur still using your hands lol self roasted
That tornado was, Uhm something
Atleast its 3rd tier
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkn " GOOD "
hahahhahahahahaahhaaahahah
he was serious when he said "i completely broke the entire game with just 1 item in raft"
you can get a rino shark head and a angler fish head
i love how hes just so chill
"Give me a few minutes." And by a few minutes, i mean 540 minutes.
Comment number 15k here
Idk but he kinda sounds like Blitzo 😭
you sound like knarfy
Let's all be honest here, the shark was the real hero of this video
23:20 is mad sus
Josh is the best at making my worst nightmares a reality in games that were made for pleasure by innocent people.
pov: josh says "QUICK RUN" and ur internet goes out   hmmmm i wonder if thats a sign for something
I love how the skeleton key that Josh uses only crushes his bones, well, forcing him through the doors
The waffle house has found it’s new host
No one needs to hire playtesters when they have Josh. Just hand him a game and he will find some bugs or something horribly wrong withing 5 minutes. The torturing random NPCs is his reward.
Josh *gets eaten by a shark  also Josh "ouchie"
Josh please stop I'm hearing you in my walls now
Josh found an exploit
liter ally
This guy is literally the man of the land
This is my favorite episode
i love how josh does ligit everying THE PERFECT WAY
perfect.
How does josh have so much time to do this bro
22:56 Illuminati confirmed
15:36  “really creepy lightning” 💀💀
sorry, "subnautica" is how you spell it
you should play subnatica
how much does your pc hate you? just a bit curious ;)
As I’m waching this I realized I just got done waching a video about 2 people surviving 100 hours on a raft irl
Looks like WAY more fun than just playing the game with boring outcomes.
I know this was probably patched, but I really hope it wasn’t, and it just became a feature
Josh would get paid so much money to be a bug tester
Your my favorite YouTuber :)
lol
i watch your videos every day
this reminds me of the satisfactory
i wonder how much time do you spend on a single raft video?
25:27 makes me fear for your mental health
You sound like Bill From Gravity Falls
The best way to describe this is “creative chaos”.
That Was very Enjoyable
6:40 hahaha
The fact that it is in survival
🦕🦖🦈🐡🐠🐟🐬🐳🐋
This man can take 9 hours to make something stupid but cant walk up stairs.  He is patient but also impatient at the same time and it is amazing
Love the useless all of you part  on 29:40 he can't stop josh
1:40 right as he ate the mango I got a windows notification. It was glorious.
Love Your Channel, And Love The "Few" Ziplines! Have a Wonderful Day!!
Wonder how high up and down below the planks can go
I remember when he made a zip line raft
Two currently 2:36 on a Friday morning and this is 30 min
i liked so much this video I came back to watch again
Board breathing first form underwater forever
Unless u count my skeleton key 💙
You are my favorite YouTuber
“well I'm sorry you feel that way door, because you're about to be barged open” 🤣
this guy just finished the game without playing the game
bro in the island he should activate the 3 antenas, when he keeps going nonstop with that thing i could non stop laughing the rest of the video, i needed to stop the video to breath again omg
Please just do it normal😢
That was "just a few ziplines. Only a few."
now I’m gonna buy this so I can create hell on computer
now I’m gonna buy this so I can create hell on computer
Customer:you have any planks?     store clerk:no.                                                               *Josh walks off with a inventory full of planks*
Every time josh do hour thing its a nightmare
He broke the entire game WITH A PLANK A PLANK this man has to much power to live
😂😂😅❤
A few “minutes” 11:59
Bro made my mom's bathroom
You should meet gray plays if you haven’t
Why do you always try to break the game
The amazing thing is you can watch this channel and not get spoiled too much on games
so true and relatable DOCTORSHATEHIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                             I                                              I                                             V
GOOD NIGHT 🔪
I mean... Those string lights ARE pretty
4:05 flashbacks to moon from S.A.M.S. saying "I spit on your clock." And sun just saying "Why????"
Omg this made me laugh so hard lol
That shark which destroyed your storage lol. Btw why can't you commandeer the cruise ship dumb game
Is this the fastest speedrun
if i ever make a game and need to find bugs i will just send the game to lets game it out because he will not fail to find every bug and glitch physicly possible
No
omg literally hilarious
14:08 what a great impersonation of Franky skywalk
The second is saw "RAFT" I was like oh no
19:00  When my bm ask me to make her food after I jus bought her sum
you missed the snowmobile!
Josh never ceases to scare and amaze me at the same time. And whenever he says "hello? helloo?" it is very scary lol.
"well this gives me an idea"   "give me a few minutes"          *9 Hours later*
Josh: needs 1 more of something * gets 100 times more of what he needs*
😂❤e
That was good
Does he have to restart every video
I love you Josh
26:38 In one part, Josh is in a hazmat suit, on the other part, Josh's pointy finger is naked
16:44
Bro cassually committed a war crime by making a Red Cross (No, seriously look it up…)
bro played fortnite in the wrong game
You killed that game!  ¦ )
Why did he stop calling the shark grace
glitch be like
I love how he just was acting casual while there was a giant whale right next to him
Probably just discovered the new speed running tech by accident
Put a rug on the wall shelves. Promise it will not disappoint.
Pacifist ending
Hey Josh I love your video so much , I bought Raft , but why is there no tutorial for 1st time players ? I'll be standing here with this stupid hook in my hand dying over and over hoping someone can tell me where to find the tutorial.
Bro just got name dropped on game grumps
ok so raft changed a lot since i've played it the last time
Josh:[breaking the Raft] Programers of Raft:ARE U F*** SERIOUS?!!
You saw a lot of CallMeKevin videos right
0:00
привет
Hurricane us lol
Door : I am locked from the other side.   Josh : I'm sorry you feel that way *clips through*
How'd you get vine goo before a furnace or even a larger island?? Cheated items?
Idea:add lights to the tornado Idea 2: use the detail plank to reach the birds (maybe you could take a bird ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ᵐᵃʸᵇᵉ)
Is there a limit to any of the Is-There-A-Limit-s? Answer: No. No there isn't.
I assume the detail plank was nerfed lol
This game has some serious clipping and physics flaws
Your detail plank discoveries are better than Poseidon, God, Allah, and Jesus combined.
The shark trope is so overused and boring at this point.  What kind of mindless devs are still using it?  Especially when it's entirely built on ignorance in the first place?
One of my favorite lines, "oh god do i have to care?"
Abandoning everyone is super funny😂😂
"Good live come laugh who float sail" -Mahatma Gandhi
You make game developer cry :))
that is just ridiculous lol
8:38
This is all scripted sadly
I worked as a programmer consultant on this game's last release. Mostly fixing bugs and optimizing collision systems... This is, hm, 90% fascinating and 10% frustrating to look at. Great work!
He's playing creative most of the time. Not survival.
Forbidden espresso💀
Combine the tornado with the multi raft raft
You do not recognize the dead bodies in the water
That's a big tornado
El tornado raft:D
"Door is locked from the inside"  Josh: *Challenge accepted*
8k years later😂
I bet you guys can’t get me to “100 likes”
This man is the entire reason games have limits on everything
Bro he just found so many game breaking bugs
20:39  basically cats
20:21 killed me 😂
Lets Game it out:No/Serial Killer God of glitches And Errors:Yes
I’m a pro at raft but holy i didnt know this item was so game-breaking. Also all those cubes must’ve taken hours along with all the wood
Jim’s waiting for you
I sped run raft in 10m
Honestly this game seems incredibly fun to speedrun.
27:12 nice Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country refrence
29:21 doors
Rafty Tafty 🍌26:35
This is *clearly* the dev intended way of playing
You need to play subnautica though :O !!!!
Im disappointed, you should have brute forced all the coordinates.
Josh’s chaotic, nightmare nature, I love it.
Imagine seeing this is torn board tornado in real life bro I would literally be so scared I would literally just try to cut it off but I would not have a ask because I'm 8 years old
What's the tallest raft one can build?
9564 for anyone who wants to speed run
I like to imagine the devs just breathing a sigh of relief after finishing the game's final chapter, fixing practically every bug in the game from large to small, and then they realize that just a couple days later that they need to just scrap the game entirely
Josh is an insane man at games by destroying anything in that game
Damn I watched a pro raftplayer react to this video and realized how much time and work goes into theses just for some jokes... thanks, keep it up
6754365376
Bro low-key sounds likes squidward
Josh has too much power He is above consequences
Holy Hell! What a ROAST!
You cina sound like double trouble
Josh just literally brute forcing his way into the safe is next level
Watch It Love It Sub To It
I love how that radio tower operator called him a "Friendly Face" after he just tried to hatchet her.
madman!
My question the whole time is just- HOW MUCH WOOD DID YOU HAVE💀💀💀
you sound like graystillplays are you his brother
I wonder if you could build plank bridges from one island to the next?  You would never need the raft again.  Too bad you can't construct something like minecarts from Minecraft.  You could just ride from one island to the next.
Every developer should hire Josh as a bug finder
Josh: give me a few minutes   9 hours later
josh: is there a limit? devs and pc: oh fu- game: ima crash viewers: hmmmmmm, i want to do that servers: ok thats it im going to explode in 3 2 1 devs: and that is how the world ended
if you help the npc you can be them...
23:22 bro moaned 💀
Games have to change logic so this menace to virtual society doesn’t ruin everything but they are too late lol
That main character did more thumbs up than all romanian emperors combined
Q I pl ❤
one man one raft
"you there get me out of this thing" Josh "Yeah that's not happing"
What is this what is this monstrosity that you made it's amazing
Josh is so good at recording days of gameplay and it putting it in 30 minute videos
The plank is basicaly the baby mode of raft
23:22 buddy got a little too excited there 💀
The lights in the tornado say HELP ME
raft pacifist route
Josh in satisfactory-there is nuclear  bombs
I love how he unintentionally commits a war crime by putting a red cross on his raft without being a medical professional.
You kinda remind me of GrayStillPlays
12:20 (nothing happened thats a time stamp when I return)
Is raft on Xbox one😊
Josh thought he was in low-budget Fortnite
Man going to make a game called ‘death to the fish’
Isn't that just the Franky Sky Walk?
This is ridiculous.... and i love it. Lmao.
Hellø-hell
I am so sad this video was released, the devs will most definitely have to nerf design planks now.😢😢😢
Please someone tell me how to download and install the new version
Why is this game different from my game?
I'm laughing so hard I'm crying. I love your videos.
your ingenuity never fails to astonish me
Josh seriously has 0 idea how to play anything by any rule of the game or physics😂😂😂 hide and seek is just a series of gunshots into the open while hes blindfolded. He knows he won when hes hears a thud or scream😂😂😂😂
that raft is a hellscape
i just now realised this was fake cuz he had metal ingots and vine goo before he had smelter
I play raft
POV let’s game it out plays  raft : what’s per bunch of zip lines is there a cap no let’s do some really cool stuff yes a tornado: dude somehow make all  videos funny
Soo stupid player
You're basically graystillplays brother graystillcousinschaos
The fact you have the free time for half of these shenanigans is utterly terrifying.
A 30 minute Josh video? We have been blessed with fruitful bounties of content.
ah yes a normal raft with nothing wrong with it its beautiful
OH NO MORE CHAOS ;-; welp goodbye fps :D
A wizard with the power of plank
It looks such a dumb game.
I just love the absurdity of it all,  I would love to see the game developers react to these vids
Josh always finds a way to brake the game bro
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Anyway, whatever we’re here now
Game: exists Josh: TIME TO BREAK YOU Creators of Hydroneer: Bounty time
Fun fact : the shark's name is (officially) Bruce.
This was hella funny to watch
He knows how to break every game in existence and it makes me laugh
Yeah LOL😂😂😂😂😂😂
6:45 imagine if shark bite of the floor that is connected to you 😂😂😂
mans made farum azula
I’m calling the shark name BOB
You should build a mansion or a cruise ship I love your channel and to make awesome Contant🎉
Josh can you make a good raft
suggestion : change your channel name to sqidward
I always lough when I watch let’s game it out 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Hey a friendly face 😊 Let's not go that far 🫤 Oh by the way do you have A BBQ grill... excellent 😮
I have to know how long this took to make
Me be I walk I break my legs 🍗
E
Yeah this ok
😂
Let's Game It Out is the kind of youtuber to do the most unnecessary things possible
E
Anyone else still giggle at come laugh?
Day 1 of asking Josh to play Subnautica.
si
I haven't been around youtube a lot lately and watching this made me start a furious binge of every single video I missed from you lol
Do you know shits about to get real when he says, “let me give you the grand tour!”
I was born 2015 can you guess what age I am also I just took a picture of my mom and then put here
When you realize how long it actually takes to get the detail plank- my dude put so much effort into his videos
Always fun, thanks.
18:20 - i read that notice as "Emergency BRIDE launch". After everything i've seen up to that point, it made perfect sense. Of course there's a BRIDE launcher there. Why wouldn't it be there? If you need a BRIDE, you just launch one, and pick it up wherever it landed. And when you get bored with one, you launch another one.
This is absolutely amazing content.
You were supposed to get the shark
A speedrun through time and space
He is just casually cheating the sistem😂😂 amazing and funny content ❤️ love it, subed🙌🏻
this guy is literally just the postal guy
How to make a developer remove an item:
This is one of the funniest things I've ever watched thank you for your sarcasm
What inspires you do destroy the fps and defying the laws of physics?
PLEASE DO NOT B- your going to buy the air horn.🙄🤦
My favourite thing is whenever he falls and hears bones cracking he just says “your fine”
Thank God they have wifi. What would we do without it?
yhi
Can u help me bro my raft show black screen
I have a game suggestion called subnautica and subnautica below zero
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
26:05 I think my humour is broken...
Never heard of Raft. Never heard of this channel. Nevertheless, I'm here for the ride. ☝️👍
Add led lights all around the tornado
It’s been not good
The code from bear island was my birth year
Chùi ui ổng tìm được lỗ hỏng game =)))
how far up can you go with the detail plank?
this is the guy that keeps game developers from sleeping
23:23 ayo sus sound 🤨
Olof: My army will crush you!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡            Josh: Haha, I know!
Josh puts the hel in help
Speed running raft
Warning there is a computer virus called josh🙃🙂
👆👍
So is this guy getting paid to find bugs or is this just how he is  Btw just found out about this channel already love it
you should meet gray still plays
3:27 i know how to rug now
How :O
Bros a war criminal
Wait Subnautica = raft 2????
i love how at 32:30 i just skips an entire bossfight
wow no clickbait at all
The best
This happens to be my favorite ride of all time and the funny part is I hate drops on rides. But the feeling like you're riding a living creature made me forget my worries
Developers please do not fix the detail plank
give me a few minutes, 9 hours later
6:00 Oh hey, it looks like that pipe screensaver! Josh: _Now that it looks like a screensaver from twenty years ago_ … and that was the moment I knew I had to subscribe.
feels like watching an speedrun xD
linkie in the despsicon i like linkie and you very gud waow jas slay
When Josh says "hold, please" that's when you know you are going to see nightmares beyond your imagination.
I want someone to try to speed run with the planks💀
What's with you and Tornados my dude!!!?
Tip
اعجبني كثيرآ استمر بالعمل الممتاز معجبك من ليبيا ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Grace the shark is back!
Favorite vid
this man is the frozone of wooden planks
Josh has a weird obsession with tornadoes
If you made a game what would you make
Can confirm, after watching this I used the detail plank to skip an annoying platforming section of Utopia 👍
22:15 wrong way
Josh is the kinda guy to look at a door, and think "How quickly can I make the devs cry"
Ah my favorite type of game video to watch, one where someone takes a seemingly mundane item and uses it to absolutely break a game into a million pieces.
Josh: Physics? Pftt what’s that😎
How much wood does he have????
How do you find this stuff
Make a part 2 where you make it HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
0:01
What is wrong with you
Hahahahahaha
"well that was sure a short lived civilization" me in 2035
Imagine raft dvloper watching this
I tried to fight this game
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂LOL ❤❤❤❤❤ 😂😂😂LOL
{'_'} this is jim he wants to take over youtube copy and past him to help
haha i love thi sguy, never fail to entertain me
I recently hit my toes so I couldn’t walk, and this made my day
🫵👍👍
The developers be like: wtf!!!
We need a dev reaction video to this lol
23:21 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
bro just speedrun
I don’t think this is what people mean when they say “walk the plank”
Did the vault really take like 1 hour?
Forget Armageddon and Ragnarok and all those other world's ends, Josh is the one we really need to fear if they ever make VR controlled construction This is a man who could find a cheat code in anything, including probably reality itself
I dunno if this is better way to play this game though
To boldly build where no board has been built before
try that game on phone it's so different
I would love to see you play GTA5 and exploit the physics. 🤣
I was born on 2011
He is honestly one of the funniest guys I’ve ever seen
this is a geocache
So do the boards still work like this? Asking for a friend...
i  want a face reavl or facereavlle what ever i want a face reveale
Ah your fine
4:44 my sound glitches so Josh said th th th th th th th th th th th this
This dudes commentary is legendary
if i ever make a game, im giving it to josh to make  intro video
fortnite fisics be like:
29:10 - "I didn't know we were dealing with a wizard."  To be fair, you ARE a wizard too, with the power of Plank Creation. Pointing your finger and then giving it a thumbs up is how you cast your spell.
You should do creative
Player- “MY LEGS ARE BROKEN” let’s game It out- ahh your fine
You always make me laugh you remind me of my uncle. lol 😆 that is a good thing
Make 5 tornadoes
Uhh ok this just something else
X_X
i love how he starts with " hey there it's josh, welcome back to lgio" when hes the only one on this channel
25:26 considering it on average takes about 2.5 seconds to input a full 4 digit number here, it must've taken him at least 4 hours and 10 minutes to do this right here.... 😭😭 Josh's dedication to breaking games and finishing certain things in the most outlandish ways possible still amazes me
how have i only just now found this channel. this is actually gold. Josh's dry humor is HILARIOUS
Love your vids! Can I ask something? Why did you stop the “Grace” jokes?
Tier 3 more like tier fish
he broke his game.
i love it
playCHKN
I am surprised that you didn't try to find what is at the bottom of the ocean
i listen to him whenever i play chess and it feels like a fever dream
we’re only 12 minutes in and there’s already a tornado of chaos
I mean, If he says he does everything legit and he actually grinds for everything then major props but I can't help but think him brute forcing the lock was actually just a quick google search This doesn't take away from the effort and quality of this video to be clear tho, video needs to call 911 cuz how on fire it be
Dude you are so funny, I laughed during this entire video. Glad I found your channel 🤣
Oh there he is
where is the Shark
This is the only YouTuber who makes me laugh
please try to go to space lol
Genius
can you go see what’s in the deep water ? A seabed? That you can pop through maybe?
Hi Josh! I've been going a bit deeper into depression lately, and your videos have been making me laugh and cheering me up. Though I can barely get out of bed, your jokes and humor have made me feel a little better :)
Now we know why we have no evidence of quantum tunneling 😂 josh used it all up in one video with the planks 😂😂😂😂
worst game i have ever played
I enjoy it very much 😁😁😁😁
This video is like a grown up fred if y’all remember that
The fact that this has reactions on other channels is hilarious 😂
my computer would have been lagging since the tornado raft lol
lol so fun to watch. new sub edit... you made my day. thanks
Imagine your on a plane nd you here from the speakers "hay guys welcome to lets game it out"
Bro is just playing Fortnite
He made the tornado raft with mods right?
you should play cms 21
A staggering amount of work !!!
I find an island but i love to be a rafter... WTF where is the logic?
“I didn’t realize we were dealing with a wizard!” naa more like my dad
Lmao this cracked me up. I want to get this game just to do this
Can you do this again with maker so Meg got to use the zipline to get to the top
Theres a reason why we cant have nice things
lets game it out: so i spent 6 years placing a bunch of walls Me:your kidding right? lets game it out:😐 Me:Your kidding right????
We all know that josh is gonna make a flippin city in raft
The tornado raft made me burst into tears😂😂😂
The developers are gonna have to put in anticheat.
Josh it's been awhile
also anyone hoping that markeplier, muyskerm and lordminion sees this😂😂😂  hell they might have already!
sooo..... nobody gonna talk about how Vasagatan is an actual location in Stockholm???!!!!  Swedish people find your inner Vikings and speak up!!! You can't have a an Austrian guy (me) showing you off!!!
Bro got the 9 hours shitpost
Raft in a nutshell
Raft: a point and click adventure
I was born 2011
wasnt this a minecraft map, before it became a game
THAT IS NOT ENOUGH STRING LIGTHS
"mom can we have presidents key from gravity falls" "we have presidents key from gravity falls at home" presidents key from gravity falls at home:
"I broke this game with just one item!" - rants for 30 minutes, still doesn't show item. Christ, this entire video is a waste of time. Just show me the damn thing and not its entire life story.
25:28 xDD I mean ... you are crazy enough to do this xD
did you really farm all those planks or used some cheat? insane
30th time watching this video!
Tiny raft: help long thing: NEVER
I love the video  😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊how are you making this  How much money are you spending on the video
LMAO HOW DOES HE DO IT HE CAN BREAK ANYTHING XD
when 13 minutes passed, I remembered the nice voice which gets gradually gets annoying Its  you, the guy from that nuclear waste video. The guy who made animals jump off with that good radioactive stuff 😂😂 absolutely amazing like the last video I saw months ago subscribed ALSO!!!! Have you ever done subnautica?
idc
The code part hurt me
your freaking commentary and fact you completely broke a game with one blueprint is amazing
whats really hilarious is that josh is probably making more money than the programmers that made the game LOL
Literally me in the future with sarcasm
This is probably the best video on yt right now
He sounds like Cleveland
Um, what's with your character's skin being light brown in first-person view, but black in third person?
how many time of your life is in this game...crazy..man
bro casually bruteforced a 4 digit code
What a loser
It's not that mad or impressive, he just used the "Xanthous raft" from dark seas
You sound like Squidward
Super easy, barely an inconvenience
55:29
"Oh god, I need to care?"🤣
The sound effects you used when clipping through walls was perfect and beautiful.
5:40 crackin me up
I'm 10 min in and am regret my decisions. But FOMO..... ok, just another 20 min...
Your raft looks like Emrakul
I am currently sick with a stomach bug and watched this right before bed. I had a bunch of fever dreams about traversing long wooden pathways suspended way up in the sky. 😂
To think this would have been avoidable by setting a limit on detailing planks in one row with no support
TORNADO RAFT AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"Cautioly skips the entire game"
Hello
I want to see a speed run of you with this
Imagine preferring to play this instead of working and earning money.
The survivors at the end dont stand a chance!
Saya sangat menghargai Karya Anda! ini sangat totalitas! Terima Kasih dari Indonesia!!🌋
Your viewers must be on the younger side.
A true king never treads onto the floor
So the storyline is about a crazy white military-aged man who enslaves brown people in a cage, and you are a brown nomadic traveler going from place to place who eventually imprisons the oppressors' and frees your fellow brown people... did I get that right?
This reminds me of when I discovered debug mode in Sonic the Hedgehog...I went mad with power.
This is my type of game. I can play very well
Where were you? When they built the raft to heaveeen!
On this game i did find a duplication glitch to duplicate items lmao so i made a giant boat but the last release patched it
Want to try to play this game, hope to bring me a different feeling.
I'm surprised you found your boat that drifted off. Usually when that happens it's game over
Smelter looks like a toilet too
u need a low pass bro
bad video
your voice is way too loud in your videos.
franky skywalk
This was amazing
This man tone ends in the same octave at the end of every sentence.
life of pi except no gf is harmed in the process lol
My favourite video of you
bro got the tism fr fr
This is amazing!! Thank you for this, subscribed!
Praise be the detail plank!
Minecraft without the Minec
Bruh you can tell this guys has 2,000 hours on raft
wow, great way to get around. you still did alot of walking...
this guy could do a great squidward voice
this may be the most epic thing I have ever watched
Before watching this I was thinking that the thumbnail definitely looked like clickbait and was just something someone put together using some kind of console commands or mods or something, but no, this man built a raft tornado in game and no one stopped him, he's too powerful.
This plank glitch blows my mind! That is one of the coolest superpowers to have.
Bro didn’t just break the game, he demolished it. The devs are probably screaming
One of the most legendary play-throughs of all time. 😂
You know you are old when you get the joke when he said "Looks like a screen saver from 20 years ago" 😂
LMAO, SEAST HE DAY....Oh Seas The Day. LOL
One of the best things I've watched.
Please play Fortnite Save the World!
You were clearly very "board" with this game
I liked it, an interesting idea
6:17 is the way this guy delivers his jokes, nearly all the time. I don't understand how people don't get sick of it.
I don't even play games... But that was hilarious.
halfway thru and im laughing so hard it hurts!! had  to  stop the video so i can catch my breath. epic video
The decoration board is a path to many abilities some would say are… unnatural
It's not a bug, it's a feature!
Was kinda hoping he'd build down to the dome that got launched into the ocean to see if the lady is in there alive.
HOW DID U GET ALL THIS WOOD?
If you love hearing people rambling on and on without you learning a single thing,then youtube is for you, it’s a perfect app to use to waist away your already too short of a lifespan.  The world is for of wonders only waiting for you to discover, please don’t waist your life on junk videos and junk food.
The game would have been better without the shark. I refunded it, because i didn't feel like dealing with BS mechanics like that.
AAA, awesome!
It really did look like a screen saver from 20 years ago . 😂😂
Always sounds a little bit like Pegasus... and a fan of games mmh ?
bro this video is so random
If your other content is similar you got yourself a new fan this is funny stuff
Awesome, as always.
So, does he have an infinite resource cheat going on or am I missing something? Never played this game...
Not going to lie, I've used really strange raft builds to get to areas I wasn't supposed to in ways it clearly didn't expect.. .But you? .. .Dude you took it to a whole new level. Color me seriously impressed.
Josh you are just on a whole different level, keep up the amazing work and entertainment. Thanks for the laughs!
10/10 I now know the whole game. 🤣
This is the most amazing video on the game RAFT that I have seen!😍
After watching this video, playing the real game would be so boring.
The Waffle House has found it’s new host
HOW DOES HE NOT LAUGH WHEN HE DOES THIS STUFF?
How on earth did you get that much wood in just 9 hours. A tree only gives you 3-4 wood, and most of the trees on large islands can't be cut down. I had an excess of wood for most of the game, but any substantial expansion guarantees I immediately run out of common materials. And the detail planks aren't cheap to make.
I have tears in my eyes man from laughing so much. This is awesome mate. Watching your entry planks swaying over land is hilarious and your bland delivery is the best. x'D
as an official raft player,there is no way you can grind for those materials
Your name must be 1900!
game of the year
idk how you guys make it through 30 mins of watching someone play raft.....
this game has changed drastically from release. mad props to the devs. looks fun now
couldnt watch, pacing was too slow, fell asleep, peace out
the board of directors have a total new meaning for me
Best bug ever.
By shark... you mean Grace.
Can u play the forest pls
such great content
Bro is the ultimate bug finder if you think about it
Triple A games should just give their games to Josh before launch to find bugs
Π[] \/\/@¥ ¥[]
That's a great ending
Hurricane Josh sweeps the ocean destroying everything in it's path
im am so confused but so happy at the same time.....
Is this raft-nado satisfactoy? :D
your voice is obnoxious
holy hell this was hilarious
I don’t usually like gameplay, but you’re so funny that I’m actually also enjoying watching the game play. But I think MrBeast gaming started that for me.
2:45–3:09 lmaooooooo
You should change the channel name to, experimenting with my ADHD dosage
18M views for a random video like this
5:15 zang so much luzuryin one raft, nespresso, toilet with a view, a visionboard??
i love watching your magic
You should play elden ring! It would be so funny
The hellspawn himself
outstanding
i cant belive that one plank thing made you make a tornado
This stuff is nuts. Not as funny as the roller coaster one though.
This is amazing 🤣
If i were a game dev i'd send a demo to this guy
You need to make an 'ahh, your fine' tshirt.
this is the oddest art
"Give me one second!" "Nine hours later"
As soon as he attached that first box to the wall I knew EXACTLY what was coming
It's nice to know Alpha is still alive ☺️
"Stable walk way" yes very stable.
Used creative without showing it. That's an American youtuber.
The real question is how did he get so many planks 😅
this will revoluitinezies speedrunning on raft
Josh is about to single-handedly make the developers remove an item
18mil views on a raft video!?
I'm really impressed by how well the game seemed to handle that ridiculousness with the decorative plank
He is REALLY gathering all of those recources?? :D
Is this supposed to be funny? Dude is just talking
20:51
HAHAHA
bro cauall ymaking speedrun strats X-X
How does Josh make a survival game into a funny and chill game
raft devs wants to know your location
I torture myself in this game but you do it better josh!
thalassophobia.... i cant even watch people play this.....
I love this. I was thinking of playing Raft, but after watching this video, I'm glad I didn't. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but for speed running the game, I got to see if it was worth playing. And honestly, no, it would not be worth playing. I'm sure we lost allot of content because of speed running the game. For example, why postit notes? Who put the postit notes? Why is one jerk, controlling this world? Why is the world like that? Who are we, that postit notes guided us to save the world?  I will explore this channel more. I want to see what other games are worth playing. I play Atlas. I used cheat codes to explore that world. My own version of speed running. I skipped boss fights. I still like Atlas, but realize, the game for me is a game I can explore, build a home, keep inventing devices, and keep exploring. My own version of Star Trek, "to boldly go where no one has gone before." The problem with Raft, for me, is that the game is locked to the story. Imagine a game where new worlds or locations keep being made. I might be suggesting games like Space Engineer. But I want content that keeps exploring interesting. Imagine, "Find new life. New civilizations...." Better yet, Star Trek Voyager, just keep exploring, improve your devices/ship/boat, make allies, fight wars, defeat enemies, then just move on to the next unexplored areas. And whenever I want, come home from work, enter this new universe, keep exploring, and just come back to it whenever I want.
I love how Josh just plays a whole game with lore and everything and he's just like "nah imma just use this plank," love your vids man.
imagine if he builded to the story islands
I dropped my phone on the ground while watching and because of the detailed planks I thought my phone broke
Josh those things that no one can do he is the most longest time waster in the world because he litterally build in a video a zoo city and it took 2 days he is doing this just for views or just for us
You’re a real Josh
his character has way too many spliters
Whats. Sup brother
me: your man has no legs josh : thes normal  me: thes not ok josh:  i don't care bye
Turn this into a speed run and you'll win GDQ!
Wow, I was not ready for what this video had to offer. This was amazing, peak entertainment haha.
Fun fact. More people watched this video than ones who played the game.
Lol... imagine If you never glitched through the whole game... how boring,tedious and difficult and not to mention boring it would be...
I want the amount of free time Josh has
@10:37 I say vegetarian too lol
Good Morning, I want to make an animation for you, to order, how can I contact you?
Dude wtf, this guy's dedication is on another level... mad respect
devs watching like bro why
You sound like if cleveland had a gaming channel
You travel around like Iceman, with detail planks.
When you went to all the new islands I was worried about spoilers, but skipping all the fetch puzzles cleared that up lol
you have gamed it out
You should do a collaboration of great evil for the store in the world
so fast  man!
Kachaw
I like video games
there's not a single silent second in this video. Jeez. Give my brain some time to breathe bro and talk a bit less
i would never have  the patience required to play this game
Man, they've been waiting for you in the nuthouse for a long time.
Screen saver from 20 years ago 😂high school at its finest!
I think you direct your videos toward a very young audience, instead of a general age right?
Im glad this video lives up to the thumbnail. You deserve a medal for that
Wood, perfectly balanced. ;)
Bros smarter than the game 💀💀
@willjum Rug is mentioned 😅🤣
Play minecaft
THIS IS JUST SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! Thanks!
Imagine your the woman at the golf ball and a plank monster shows up and a man defied gravity and launches you into the ocean
Can i play in mobile
6:30 It's funny when you intentionally play the game stupid and now you accidentally make something that looks good.
Josh cool
3:26 is where I lost it
Detail Plank is God Tier
I guess I missed the last Raft video
I was crying the entire video x'D My stomach hurts, halp! xD
I hate this guy's voice. Is it that California infection that lowers everyone's IQ?
LOL the last bad guy was named Olof
Entertaining. But why collect anything when you're playing on creative mode.
problematic for OCD patients, so messed up raft !
Art, pure art
This guy is probably as close to an Eldritch Entity as humanity got so far.
Dude your sarcasm is everything ☺️
The shark can eat your raft😍
😍sharks
i don´t play raft but i watched this video to the end, awesome ^^
From the review page on steam. If you own this game request a refund just to draw attention to this problem  Raft Multiplayer and Online has a very critical security breach. That can be used to execute arbitraty code on your computer. The developers did not fix this breach so far, even thoug they were informed Months ago. This breach was found by the french Security firm Synacktiv.  This breach is so critical, that i will not start the game until it is fixed. And i would recommend you to do so.  Edit (03.01.23): On 22.12.22 the Developers published a patch with the patchnote: "We just wanted to let you know that we have just now pushed a small update containing a rework of the multiplayer network code, to increase security for hosts and clients."  They do not reference directly to this vulnerability. According to a Reddit User this bug fixes the vulnerability.  Even if this fixes the vulnerability. Ignoring and closing bug reports for months, and only fixing critical security bugs after a security firm publicly informs the players about it. is very bad practice. Obviously the developer does not have the security of their players in mind but the bad press.
So raft is rust on the ocean
The fact that the game still runs smoothly with the gigantic wooden tornado is the true miracle here.
"That's right, it goes in the square hole"
I want the Dev's to watch this. Lol
yo
one very earned like and comment.  much entertainment.
Now go break Lost World!! It's like a more graphic intense version of Raft
What I'm wounding is: Do you actually need to get the corrodents to go to all the places? What I mean is if you knew the corrodents from the start of the game, could you just skip ever fetch quest and go to the last location?
Play on .75x to switch to drunk Josh
11:30
The game works perfectly. No exploits LOL!
If I had a penny for every time LGIO built a huge tornado in a simulation game, I’d have two pennies, which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.
"broke the entire game" is a massive overstatement and clickbait title. You didn't break anything.
lol, so much fun watching this mess
This is the first of your videos, that I have seen. Dude, you are super funny. Love the content Keep it up you legend !! Thanks 😅
Raft in ohio💀
Couldn't listen that voice more than 30 sec
Petition to make his catchphrase “Is there a limit”  | \/
What a great looking game i completely ruined playing through by watching this entire spoiler for it. =/ Funny as hell though, had me chuckling all the while. =D
11:28 And the chaos begins.
i have watch this a few times and it makes me laught uncontrolablely even time good job this video is nearly as amazing as travis scott falling of the stage in autotune (i watch that one about 100 times i would say my teacher is still traumatized by it)
"... straight to heaven..."
the last time i play raft, there is no trading post, and no people on the radio tower, is this new patch thing?
Josh is probably the only youtuber than can say 9 hours later and it actually took 9 hours
Since when do mangos come from palm trees😅
Oh no walking 😞😞😞😞😞😭😭😭😱😱😱😱😱😱
Holy crap what an intensely boring game.
Isn't he in Creative?
At this point, Josh has single-handedly contributed more to game development than entire testing teams ever have
this is hilarious
The amount of cutting in your vids gave me a seizure
This man is the most hardworking youtuber I have ever seen
With the vault/safe could you do a timelapse on that instead so we can see how long it took
How he’s know it’s my first time watching
there is less space between ur sentences than it is between ur words, unwatchable.
i know he takes the games to the extreme but was this one made in creative in just curious
the wooden surfer
Can't just leave i will gave to subscribe to this channel
To be honest these videos are normal to me at this point
Can someone draw/create a superhero/villain based of the series of events that happened here. Basically a man that summons 4×6's at while to move freely around the world with a giant wooden tornadoe swirling beneath him?
Nice game I like the realistic aspect of it
hey josh you should play a game called no man's sky. It's a  game like astroneer and satisfactory if they had babies
You made the devs rethink their life decisions.  😆 🤣 😂
I got a little board
When Josh says "hold, please" that's when you know you are going to see nightmares beyond your imagination
omg i'm dyiiinnngggg. my gf and I only managed to jank one puzzle before these boards come out. there's a jumping puzzle in utopia. we just rode the pullies instead. XDDD
"I'm sorry you feel that way, door"
It’s the tree of life!
5:45 THANK GOD HE USES A SAIL
...
I assume all these glitches and clippings are fixed
This is INSANE
I love how at 22:24 he says "which makes me a mere mortal, and we can't have that" that's one of my favorite parts. BTW not sure how shortcuts work
I started playing this but thought you just sit there and catch things. I had no idea this was an actual game...
I love how he makes everything harder, and doesn't reuse one of the... uh, "pathways" also the developers should've changed the code
Frankly and chopper
my daughter will laugh just as hard as i did @ forbidden espresso!🤣
MY MANGO IS TO BLOW UP💥
Gg
2:52 The shark be like: :0 what's this? A stack of chest well don't mind if I do!
Yoooo I didn’t know I got featured in this game! 24:23
josh just made the tornado from satisfactory in raft oh wow.
bro i didnt lught i died
Imagine if you saw a guy do this irl….😂
The game brreaker
My man you must have spent 9 hours to do that raft.. I mean seriously dud
I had to pause this so many time because I couldn't stop laughing. This is amazing. Thank you
Hell More like help.
Hhhh what a perfect ending xD
my first raft has a massive crane ramp thing I use to get to high areas (some you normally can't get to) quickly also has ziplines along it etc, you can clip through anything on a zipline last time I played.
Wow, this video was hilarious and so creative! I've never seen someone break a game like that before. Your patience and dedication to finding every glitch and exploit is truly impressive. Keep up the great work, can't wait to see what you come up with next!
i farted right when the video ended
I watch this video once a month, it's a masterpiece.
gg nhytnthyt,gggbhhffvgf
the way he just gives the thumbs up every time he places a board, creeping ever closer to cheesing his way through the entire game, is just golden
"Just give me a minute" proceeds to spend 9 hours on a wood tornado
Live. Raft. Love
you can get infintite hammer head sharks if you revisit the location over and over again
Awesome again :)  i enjoy this soo much!  Wish it was weekly
24:28 that thing looks like a damn wither storm lol
I thought I was only going to watch one minute of this. Whoops.
The thing that makes Josh different from other YouTubers other than insanity is his patience you know he’s willing to spend 19 hours just to Achieve his monstrosity Edit: I know he doesn’t do it legitimately but he give him some credit he builds these things unless there’s some kind of building AI that I don’t know about
this is hilarious lol love this !
The most entertaining random i have ever found
I know that took hours😂
This guy is basically the how to basic of the gaming world, perfect
bro cheating without hacks
Came here, looked for timestamps in the comments to jump to the "breaks the game part". Glad I watched the entire video instead. This was hilarious.
I really hope they don't try to fix this
This was glorious
Olof: AHHH      Hdhehd shbsb
Not funny.
Wooden Surfer
"Now we stare into the sunset while enjoying our victory mango. MMmmMmMMmmM."   What was that noise?🙂✋
19:23
don't forget seas he day
Occulonimbus edoeqqus
i am not familiar with the game, but the content was so entertaining!! thanks
19:49 🎵BABY WE BUILT THIS HOUSE🎵 🎵ON MEMORIES🎵
This is why foundation support is necessary when you have building in a game lmao
God you're annoying aren't you....
this game is broke
he litterally built an entire storage unit, but the shark thought otherwise
Game name?
When I saw this video I thought that the raft was a tornado until the end
"That I can get behind" bAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH I laughed so much. First VOD Of your's I've watched. Not the last. Great job! Thank you!! SUBBED and LIKED!
19:24 does she actually scream? Lmao
Imagine Hashirama casually pointing his fingers at you and then slowly build a wooden bridge between you and him. That's how menacing this feels.
If THE FLOOR IS LAVA was a game
You're a 1337 gamer, big respect
Lol the way he went ahhh in 2:53
I can feel myself rage quitting everytime I see the shark, im glad you're playing and not me
This is brilliant. I love the pop sound when you force through the doors/windows.
Is it.. is it a speedrun?
I don't know why this popped up on my feed, but it was hilarious.
Who taught the raft SPINJINTZU
i would have NEVER looked in the water for rocks playing the game lol
omg this game have so much new things lol need to download again
Must be nice being the reason Devs cry themselves to sleep at night... lmao
What mod do you use for infinite planks?
as a person who is on a real raft i can confirm this is real logic
Eren Yaeger type beat
I don't know how or why this popped up, but it was frickin hilarious
one of your best videos
10:20  Is like bed glitch in your Brookhaven  👇
he cheated half of the game lol
Let's game it out hope you respond to my text question will you ever God  dam make a normal play though in any game
Yay not click bait
Normal people: Huh, a plank that can connect in the air in any way possible... interesting. Josh: Time to turn this game into a nightmare bigger than what it was supposed to be >:) *creates an entire tornado as big as the oil rig/ radio station itself*
4:28 he says sea
What in the hell this guy is like some type of Jerma985
Yo I like your planks 😂 I also love how you left her in the launch pad while it launched into the ocean
well this was how I learned how detail planks work... I have seen a whole new world of possibilities
Josh really just speed runned the whole entire game
The complete and utter disregard for reality, physics, logic, or reason is awesome!
0:14  trip wire hell
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. The mistake is not yours, Josh. It was Raft's creators letting it loose in your hands! I think I have a permanent eye twitch after watching this video.
that was very smart
I would love to see GrayStillPlays and Josh here collab to see who’s more chaotic in their gameplay videos.
Does he mod in infinate resources, or does he do hours and hours of grind off camera?
your dad jokes in another level
I love how he added in popping sound effects
Bruh I really watched this video and knocked out
Everybody everybody everybody scream
Wakey wakey eggs and bakey
im sure josh got 0 in all tests in the school but because he outsmarted the teachers
And the shark ate all the chests it was very depressing…
Omg I miss you so much
Reminds me of tornado conveyor belt in satisfactory
and doess not need any walking
josh why didnt you use the snow mobile is fun to use
*If sarcasm was a video*
Well THAT was a ride.
thought he was about to start speaking a new language when he kept climbing up
When im having a nightmare, its josh talking to himself in front of my bedroom door, shortly after, i hear a "pop" as he appears in my room , opens the door from the inside and starts pulling planks through.     LPL did that in the past, but at least he opened it from outside.
His raft vids are MWA.
2011 was the year that I was Born
Pay when the guy put one or maybe three points but you put a thousand zip lines 1000 zip lines 🤣🤣😂😂 talk about a whole bunch of zip lines
Would love to see what you do with Embers Adrift.
I would love to see the developers react to this video
Absolutely terrible. Are developers even trained anymore? Smh
25:30
Here I was thinking this was going to be haha I build big funny thing. Ended up learning how to beat the game with a decoration tool.
man defeated the game
Didn’t expect a simple plank can break the game
22:31 hahahahahaha I just love how casual he looks walking underwater like that 🤣🤣🤣
This is how you play a game with no violence (physically🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Josh: The only man youll ever meet, who turns his tornado raft, into a massive mobile base.  Wonderful!
If Squidward were a real person and was a streamer...you get this guy.
Man.. I'm dying...i love this
Im enjoying this whole video.. Thanks for creating this wonderful video hahah
Best Raft Gameplay
This guy is has such unhinged ideas
Can we talk about liquid copper being a "forbidden espresso" 😂
"Why would we wanna use our hands" when we can use our hands to brute force the game with planks instead, I hope the devs see this video one day and don't fix this discovery like most devs would because this isn't harmful to the games experience,  its actually adding to it because your learning new opportunities and ideas from these things we've seen been done in this vid
Creative mode but you kept it tutorial-like
everytime you play a game, there is 1 programmer who don't sleep fixing exploit you found
GOOD LORD 17 MILLION VIEWS???
The method to the madness is indiscribable
Yeah😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
BeansAtHome
POV me when josh said 2 buildings with a Crain in the middle: that looks oddly familiar…. 👁👄👁
Bro no clipped 8 times in the backrooms
Josh hide from the devs they will patch this and you know that
5:58😂🤣😭6:27👀😱🥺13:29🤣
You should play spore!
i was gonna buy the game on console when it came out , but i just watched this video so ive had all the entertainment i can get out of this game
Why is it always tornadoes...
Idk why but this reminds me of "This is Art"
I am baffled at the amount of effort you are willing to give to make that magnificent aquatic tornado and brute force a 4 digit passcode. Bravo, truly playing as the devs intended.
"Reactor malfunction? Oh god, do I need to care?" wheatley, but make him chaos instead of stupid
hanging lighta!
AWOKAWOKAWOKAWOK
Yknow, I know josh doesn’t take anything seriously but I have so much respect for how dedicated he is to giving us funny content. This guy literally put in codes to a digital keypad over 5000 times just because he knew people would laugh at it; or he’s completely insane. One or the other
Ah yes, Josh the semi-casual speedrunner
the guy is legend. video is just a half hour while with the gameplay and video edit he spend 300 hours. the trollerest youtuber i have ever seen. amazing skills and humor
Josh is the best YouTuber there is
to me I think that the screen saver is creepy
Man is trying to tell the speedrunners something
This walkthrough is a masterpiece XD
My man just build a giant wooden cyclone, and I’m not sure whether to be impressed or afraid  it might be both
Speedrun be like:
hahhah hilarious
25:20 I am actually concerned about this man’s well being
29:08 Josh's laugh is just *chef's kiss*
Oh wow thats long
🥱🥱🥱 creative
“I didn’t realize we were dealing with a wizard!”  This guy…. Just found this channel last night and I am so entertained!
19:22
squidward's youtube channel is about expected
Essa jangada ficou louca de mais , estilo balão , parabens pela criatividade , eu mesmo fiz um avião daqueles antigos com asas duplas
The amount of time this stuff must take man, thanks for all of the fun vids.
Idgfa about raft but damn your video editing and story telling is so powefull.
I wonder how far underwater you can go.
I worked as a programmer consultant on this game's last release. Mostly fixing bugs and optimizing collision systems... This is, hm, 90% fascinating and 10% frustrating to look at. Great work!
BRO HOW
You're  the  best  josh
Гениально!🤣🤌
wow!
Hey Josh you know Axolot has another game that is even less optimized? It's called scrap mechanic give that one a whirl 🤣
among us
when i saw the 9hrs i was already in tears
This is true Speedrun skills
Tornado 1: Much Satisfactory Tornado 2: Return of its Raft
Imagine living in an island and see a man building right towards you menacingly held by just a 1 giant raft-nado
One of the code is my birth day i just realized- 😂
at this point josh is just making new tips for speedrunning random games
That was awesome. I liked how you went through the whole game just in a unusual way. It was hilarious
Not come pared to gray still plays
😂 take that quest I was suppose to do, hurricane us😂
Lmao bro is crazy
5964
“Trash Collection Raft “ collecter stretchs for 100 miles

You are a cheating little bugha
6:00 "Screesaver from 20 years ago" That got me so good. Bro that screensaver was top notch
He be big brain
nice sense of humor man, i was literally laughing out loud several times :D
the fact that he was caged and up in that balcony thwoing dynamite had me dying. now im dead... RIP ME 1999-2022
That mutant green hyena at the end is kind of adorable.
Can you seduce and stuff the shark to persuade it to stop attacking you and your raft?
8th time watching this episode now😂
Vegetarian🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀
No way i'm new and this looks good.
You should make Mario
Thank you josh, you teaching me how to really enjoy the game
This was definitely on sandbox mode. There is no way he did this on normal
I saw one of Josh’s videos then I became addicted is that just me??? Or did that happen to other people 😅😅😅
Bro I love you content heck I'm even subscribed to you on a different account your just funny as keep up with committing war crimes in the funny tycoon games
You sound like Magic Man from Adventure Time
Xanthous Raft
Mokuton style is OP
Bro forgot how to drown
i really hope thy didnt/dont take this out of the game lmao
Is it normal to vomit through your nose
You insane)))
Add tsunami Raft
I love how josh just casually spend like 30 days just for one gaming video
Ya
You’ve gotta be from the midwest xD
Vent your difficulties with me I have much love to share
Can you play the sims again
this is working perfectly for me
"Let's not go their" NAH JOSH U TRIPPIN💀
I want to see the Devs react to this
dude go outside
Ayo
Easy pesy eggs and wezy
Could not stop laughing!
I'm laughing so hard! I can't breathe!

Let’s Game It Out is just GrayStillPlays’ lost brother
more like  zoo topia
What would happened if you did save the lady at the golf ball lol
did you no scp's are rel
Raft speedrunners be like 👀
thanks sweet easyness made my day
Why not just Brute force the coordinates
Make sure during editing that you leave no space after each clip so that the entire video sounds like one huge run-on sentence
squidward
Man, "[definitely not Minec]Raft" looks like an awesome game
this gives graaystillplays vibes and I'm here for it
How long would you say it took to make this vid
This may be Josh's magnus opus
I love how Josh finds a way to break any game. Keep up the good work
Incredible. Raft is perfect, just the way it is!
My wife hates you for how simple you made all this.  lol
Truly the pacifist run of all time
Soo... you build this huge bomb to blow open the door... instead if just throwing a rock through the window?
Game: *Exists* Josh: Is that a challenge?
I like when games brake like this
Speed running
Great
The biggest lie about this video is that this game requires you to be CONSTANTLY cooking and eating, purifying water and drinking.
You beat raft in 32 minutes!!
Astonishing
hey uh, can you get to the part where you break the game i don't really care about the tutorial, its built into the game
josh "oh god, do i need to care"
It's like Valheim, but on the sea without physics
How much materials do you have😂
Genius... You unlocked the pacifist route of the game!
"SO we can enjoy our victory mango" "MMMMMMMMMMM"
I died with that board express 😂😂😂😂
Yes yes that was totally intended
That was epic. +1 sub
Dude you just defied the rules of the game
Ye olde words of wisdom, “Learn learn learn learn and learn
How long does this take you?! 😂 🧐🤨🤔
I really hate the way you talk its the most anoying thing ever just be quiet so I can see what you are doing without having to cringe every second
The level of sarcasm is delicious! 😂
you need to watch some speedrun videos of the story islands.
Your videos never cease to disappoint me
I died @ 2:40 lmao
0:50 *I JUMPED SO HARDDD*
Palm leaves and mango!
6:03 ❤
Josh gets a literal pencil: makes a nuclear bomb
Nobody: Josh: antannuh
Your channel is a wealth of countless lessons for how gamedevs can prevent their games from breaking. The scientists must learn by studying the virus.
I have rarely watched through an entire game stream/playthrough without skipping. This is just so entertaining. liked and subbed!
Is not Cheat, is good way to use IQ
You're the best 😂
that is very nice
I am not even mad. I am impressed. I think this is cool mechanic.
this mf dont play for the the final boss he's here to BE the final boss
Raft spedrun
Bruh
This man is the greatest gamer of all time this video should be a tutorial 😅 for lfe
he cheated in collectiong planks right?
Josh:I’m on the moon and my ship is’t working we’ll I have a solution. His solution:jump down to earth. His legs:where fine.
game looks super boring
26:03 *the hell it does require a blowtorch*
What a fantastic bug to end with, hes so angry at your voodoo magic, he now forever throws his voodoo magic from above his clones prison.
U r genius!
Thanks for the video ,not buying the game now 🤣
i know that this is a little late but if u jump off and back onto a zipline over and over you can go up them
This was perfect
you crack puzzles like i crack bases in dayz
God dam that game looks f***ing dumb, such bad building mechanics 🤣😅🤣
I'm convinced that this guy is actually a really complex social experiment to see how insane one person can possibly be
watching you makes me think about how interdimentional aliens entities coud play in our reality like this
0:06 you saved the ocean
imagine throwing wood into the ocean and you wouldent think a random stranger stranded picks it up
Would really know if the women is still in the Tower underwater. 😱
Perfect playthrough.
josh is the kind of guy to discover a bug in a beta game and ask: is anyone gonna eat that
wasen`t the game lagging ?
Josh is wonderfully certifiably insane.
You always find a way to break any game you play, so much fun.  Door is locked? No problem, I just use planks to force my way in :P
LooooooooooL
Entire Game
i'm suprised josh hasn't played the sims 4 yet
Did you notice do you know how you point telling about that little pointy finger like right there after it points and you play it gives you a thumbs up the guy does thumbs up👍👍👍💪💪💪💪
6:30 Actually looks good
great game
you know with most youtubers a title like this would be clickbait, I'm so glad it wasn't.
you just ruined this game for millions of people lol
xDDD
Honestly, what absolutely broke me was the games 'Happy Ending' consisting of a madman screaming incoherently and throwing dynamite at anyone in sight while they all tried desperately to ignore him.
nice game
i have to respect the grind. this is borderline insane. might need to get that checked out
Do the girls now have radiation poisoning?
face reveal?
Bro can be a speed runner 😂
I love a happy ending
امی گیم را نزن او بچه

Can you play roblox?
Let's subchicken harimousse sheesh it out
This guy is real hell for game developers :))
nice
This needs to be in a museum next to an exhibit explaining the idea of Abstract Thought lol
This video is so  bored in
This video made me crack up well and truly. Funniest YT video I've seen in ages and I really appreciate this channel and your use of the board!
i'm too tired for this.
Should also state hiw many hours this took, im on hour 10 and still yet to get a transmitter going
Speed runner + detail plank = world record finish time: 420 seconds
"noted well keep the raft small." small...
wtf ouchie? you like 9 years old?
Holy (censored) that is the hardest I've laughed in a long time 😂
board.
How tf did u get so many planks
Josh: *Exists* Game Devs: AAAAAAHGHGH
Is it just me, or were those string lights actually pretty!       Nope just me, alright then-..
When ever you hear him say hold pls you know he has done at least 2 hours of building
If let's game it out and graystillplays did a colab it would be the end of the world
THE TONADEO IS NOT BIG ITS SOO SMALL
You can jump and throw the hook, and throw the hook a lot farther
14:12 why does the number Seems so familiar
How many years you spend to make 1 second of video?
Josh ALWAYS finds a way to break or like skip the game
😂😂😂😂👌👌👌
When Josh is on bear Island he complains about walking and he still has to walk on the detailed plank anyways
This whole episode is just pure genius and I don't even know what to say about the ending XD
Raft devs please do not fix this wonderful feature. It’s the greatest thing since sliced bread.
Josh found a lot of bugs that speedrunners would love to use.
I couldn't help to watch this you had fun with a stupid raft thank you for making a stupid video
This video makes me want to play this game just using this exploit. Glitches make games so much fun to me.
14:13 My birth year 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🆘😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘⚠️🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿👁👄👁
Quality Content🔥
Fak ahahahaha really dude.
people who want face Reveal   👇👇
"I'll just take the board express"
Should've put lights on the creepy lightening 15:35
BEST CHANNEL EVER KEEP UP YHE MEMES
Totally a *normal* raft
Say no to physics in the game🙂
basically graystillplays brother
This is art
name the shark grace >:)
Im asking on how the hell Josh knew everything for breaking every game he playin'?
Did you spend 300mil wood?
"FaBuLoUs  CaSh PrIzEs" "YeAh" "FlEsH WoUnDeR NoT" "Can we place it over the edge? We SuRe caN. Can we walk on it? We SuRe CaN't"
Josh would be a great beta tester
378k upvotes? People play this boring trash? lolwut
as soon as he cuts off you know that he has made somthing crazy
Lol
Is it just me or does anyone else think that josh and gray still plays should do a collab. It would be perfectly destructive.😂
I have a great idea: make your raft a floating platform and delete the one in the water, grace can't hurt you
Lol whats the music you use for whenever you make us do the timestamp ting
hey letsgameitout there was a newupdate on worldbox
josh: i don’t wanna use my legs to walk 20 meters! also josh: let’s bruteforce this safe code for multiple hours instead of doing the simple puzzle!
This dude need to collab with Call Me Kevin
The lesson of raft is if you have planks you are immortal
Josh saying you learned rug sounds like some stupid ai you would find in a trampoline park telling you what to do😂
Yes Let me just travel 9 realms to collect post it notes
i am back
I want the game developer reaction on this
the way u play it was fun
Just a few zip lines💀
Are you sure it stable?😅
How do you do these
"Hey! A friendly face!" she says to the axe murderer
After watching this video I’m fully convinced josh is a dangerous sociopath who is fully aware of his actions and is using this goofy behaviour to cover up his malicious even criminal activities
Boards = Freddy?
ITS BACK!!!
The Wooden Sherfer! xD
Grace is back 🥹
Yow wtf
hes so fun in my lifi and optnien
I love your video ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ You are a god
Your video style is very refreshing❤
I laughed so hard watching this entire video!!!! LOL!!!!!
The tornado raft.    I love your "these things shouldn't work but they do." Simulator/tycoon videos so much.
I'm a bit perplexed about "recent" boom of reaction videos to Josh.  I am not a fond of them in general as it brings no new content whatsoever... but on the other hand I saw Josh's channel gaining quite a few new followers which is a good thing.  I didn't want to say anything meaningfull with any of this... I just wanted to rant as an old watcher of LGIO.
that ship is jean jackets brother
All the content creators that i watched is considered noobs compared to josh
Genius 😍
You just like graystillplays
Y is te raft prety to
Can you make a base in one of the main Islands
When he says give me a minute its gonna take hours sometimes days
I was so sad when the first couple AdventurePlanks got broken off. Why waste all that work?! Very satisfied when their successors were preserved for horrific posterity.
That is very sensible
Candy
The new super-hero... "Plank O' Man" 😀
this is amazing
16:36 ‘’I’M AN GENIUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!’
This games seems boring only fetch quests
3:51
I just realized that the guy on the Raft title screen looks kinda like Colono from GrayStillPlays' Sims 4 vids.
fantastic work and josh is literally my idol and u make me laugh like no cap
I've never laughed so hard at destroying a video game. I love how you think. Every video is hilarious.
HOW MANY WOOD PLANKS DO YOU HAVE??!?!?
You light up my day Thank you!
Can anybody figure out how much resources this took
Lmao
Chernobyl could have prevented if they'd just used the clipping exploit
THANKYOU SO MUCH!!!!!
I love how he is like “just give me a minute” 9 hours later “here it is!”
I Hope they dont correct the decorative plank bug
#1 most valuable game tester.
Want to play City skylines it's on Nintendo switch and PC and since you like to destroy your PC and since you like to destroy your PC I think it's pretty obvious what you're going to choose
hhhgdnyeygvrcftttteb5vcfwtr
Flashbacks to bearnado
I wish i could re sub 😂😂
The entire Raft storyline in one word: Parcour!
20:38 “If I can’t use it or knock it over what’s the point?” I feel like that quotes just the pure embodiment of Josh.
this is like people ruin everything but less cursed. oh. *that reminds me.* DO UNDERTALE PLEASEEEE
I broke myself trying to figure the game out
After watching this, there will be next beautiful breakable he made.
You  are fin
How on earth do u get so much wood
Franky shipwright simulator.
this is like cocomelon for adhd brain
Did you cheat to get so much wood?
Oh god this was one of the best videos ever. Didn't have a good laugh for a long while, thanks
Welcome to another episode of Let's plank it out!
the creators be like: ....... is there even a way to fix this
Love the glitching through things
Hi grace
Is that a custom song at the end? Or what is the name?
Josh just gave robbers a new strategy to break in people's home
CD g v
This game looks like fun. I’m really bad at these types of games tho because I have no imagination. I can never figure out how to build stuff.
How does he get so many boards 😂😂😂😂
hahahahaha xD
What always amazes me about Josh is the sheer amount of dedication. I play many of the games he shows and the time it takes to play the game normally is already quite long. Now imagine playing Raft but every time you have to go somewhere in your raft, you have to climb a hundred beams for no reason.
“Nah youre fine”  Thats my parents.
This is too funny
"I didn't know I was dealing with a wizard." says the guy whose character becomes unfazed by any and all matter in the universe due to some wooden planks.
Ok, how did u get so much wood? Or are u just in free play mode?
Now he needs to top the raft
Work smarter, not harder
Everything is good so how is it crap
I love the S’Cream
His ship is basically an Eldritch Abomination.
Setting fire to Utopia sounds like the kind of thing Josh would do.
Two entrance keys…. you mean two planks
The best thing is that you can always come back to the exact position and enter everything again xD
You know he never fails to clear my BOARDom
It's the board surfer!
whenever you hear Josh say: "i build a few" you just now a whole nightmare is coming up and i love it
I cant believe this is possible in the vanilla game lmaoo
WHO TF TAPED TAZERS TO THE HELP ROBOTS
2:54 watching that caused me permanent trauma
Oh my gosh is that Josh from let’s game it out :O ;O
I can see why devlopers don't invite Josh to gametest their games anymore, last time Lil Johnny had a heart attach by Josh's ingenuity
This game should be called "Vacation Hell in the Maldives"
Evil white man villian with innocent poc that saves the day, sounds like every other media plot line
Josh, what tornado destroyed your life?
the way that this dude ruins games is so unique
Q1
Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, but the sheer patience to pull off some of this stupidity is just purely admirable. Like, 9 hours to make the Tornado Ship of Doom, so how many hours were all the other boards you made to skip every site? How long did it take to brute force that code? How long did it take to paddle to literally every place? How long did it take to gather all the supplies for everything? How'd your PC not just combust running all that crap? Incredible. 11/10, your artistic vision knows no bounds.
12:07 *bear-nado 2.0*
That was epic!
play bit life
I clicked to check what this vid is about and here I am glued to it watching the whole damn thing
sitting in the chair you go through the wall
the devs r like o_o
Josh: I crafted my own path, you followed your quest, maybe we're both the same
hahahaha im enjoy your video
I’m sad I didn’t subscribe before now, but I’m glad this was the video I subscribed on 😂  I’ve watched Josh for a while but didn’t realize I never actually subscribed
A masterpiece!
"Now this is a boss fight I can get behind" Omg I'm dieing.
This guy seems like a way more chill version of GrayStillPlays
This game never worked for me
Josh plays games and then breaks them he's so ridiculously funny! I'd call him a game tester then a game breaker.
Look how far you can get by just pointing with your finger
zzzzz
you're insane XD
Is it just me or is he the exact same as gray still plays he has pretty much the same voice same personality and same sarcasm! Btw love y’a keep up the vids
LooooooL Flash 😂
Tfw I can't even survive a shark attack...I had no idea there was wayyyyyy more to see in the game
That was a thing of beauty.
Biblically accurate raft
THE SHARKS NAME IS GRACE YOU GOBLIN BASTARD!!!!!
This destroys my ocd
Devs are like “Make sure that Josh can’t cheat the entire game” Josh hold my uno reverse card
newton's crying at the bath lol
This raft is probably the origins of either the kraken or cthulu or both. A enormous tentacled sea beast
Frozone?
PETER PAN REFERENCE TO NEVERLAND!!! (27:12)
Just found your channel last night.  I haven't laughed this hard at a gaming channel ever.
Your "walking the plank" lvl is over 9000!
In Josh’s mind “just a few” means the amount of stars in the observable universe😂
Gotta respect the behind the scenes hour's of grinding for these videos, just for our entertainment and the complete destruction of developers plans
Olof: “Stay away from me!” Josh: “I will not” He says as he menacingly builds towards him one plank at a time.
Using the boards to go everywhere really reminds me of the RuneScape Tile challenge for some reason. Love how they break reality.
Game Maker You're done debugging your game It's time to launch  Josh, no, it's not over, Sharingan's
Omg this is so funny, sometimes people breaking the game is more funny than playing game regullary :D
Henry can’t type
Henry can’t speak
josh this my first time account so I can subscribe to you love your content
i just woke up with the hangover and had this beautiful crazy story for the breakfast... now I've seen everything :) thank you!
25:28 There are 10,000 possible safe combinations. He went through 5960 of them.. LOL
Josh is very much like Soongebob when he's trying to rebuild his house, lol
this is my fave video you have ever made   it is very funny
As a fellow Josh I can proudly say that all other Josh’s are just as crazy as this one
Imagine the girl wakes up and is like “where’d he go?”
That game is awesomely broken. I wonder if that was what they were going for.
Josh calling Grace just “the shark” hurts me
You should do one where you build a “normal” everyday family home 😂❤
Tornado raft, cousin to the nuclear cocoon.
go check out the weird top of the building while its under water and use the detailed planks to get there
This is why you are my fav YouTuber
Exquisite
Josh when he gets the detail plank : Peace was never an option.
He does raft several times but on his channel I can’t see any playlist of just raft. Am I missing it? He has playlist of all the other games he plays multiple times
The cantilever strength of those detail planks is incredible
which mod is he using to get the items?
I love his voice! Edit: this is my 5th time watching the vid!
Unlimited planks?
2:54 that's a pain to see
20 seconds in and I already think you're a madman.
Josh is the reason why we can't have nice things.
The tornado is coming hide when the tornado is made out of wood A WHAT
Best Raft playthrough ever.
27:33 to 27:35 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
This was made on my birthday 🤣lol
Some raft professionals have reviewed this
Him : Gives the detail plank  Seconds later has the detail plank
I've never seen a game that violated this far, man has a serious issues
This guy is one funny smart sumbee
After watching this, the dev who came up with the master key at the end is going to quit his job. 😅😅😅😅
As someone who loves Raft I am both deeply offended and impressed by basically everything in this video
Why is the shark not named Grace anymore?
You just perfectly gamed it out
Am I the only one that would like to see some behind the scenes making of videos of these game it out videos? of course not all of it, but some of the planning and thought process, coz damm! So much work went into this! Thanks for all the hours upon hours spent to make me laugh for 30min... You're an absolute legend Josh!
Does the master key have little black keys to open the locks for him 😂😂😂😂
Ah, let’s  die
this playthrough is a masterpiece
Genius level game ruining free of charge!
The tornado ship was too powerful
“If I can’t use it or knock it over, what’s the point?” True words of wisdom
He’s definitely cheating. He always seems to be so resource rich but only key items like wood and plastic seems to increase with no indication of food in his inventory. Entertaining video, but not an accurate representation of a play through.
25:26 HOW!!!!!!!!
Josh:is there a limit?  Game:please no
that was..... really genius
And did he really take 8 hours to make a tornado
Gosh josh you get ahead of your self every video you either crash or destroy and find a way to glitch things or whatever
Tornado raft looks like a volcano just upside down glowing but it's cool🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who else just found Josh one day and now we’re here?
"if i can't use it or knock it over, what's the point?" - my cat
bro just invented a new speedrunning method
please play Factorio
24:32
If life was a simulation, this would not exist because it is such a dream.
5:35 or "HELP"
Build a raft around an island
Josh is the only YouTuber I believe when he says he tried any code up to 5964 to open the safe. (instead of looking the answer up)
Agreed
Are you insane
What’s wrong with you
When did you find the glitch/exploit for the Detail plank?
wow! a nice ending to a magical journey :D
play among us
What game is this called can you you download it on a phone for a tablet or a computer which one can I download it on I really want to play it
The Raft community really lost their collective s*** over this one. Good job, Josh.
Johnny 2x4 is this universe's Thanos apparently.
you are seriously one of the funniest humans on this planet. thank you for existing
I'm way to excited that this video is 30 mins long lol 😅🤣
When he said why should we use our hands he used his hands to build the plank
Woman stuck on the chair: "Yo! Get me out of this thing" Josh: yeah haha not happening🤣🤣
Зовите этого парня на бета-тесты он все баги найдет
how much thought and trial&error planning the devs did making this and they destroyed it themselves by adding ...a board,all the testing they obviously didn't do with it.if I were them I'd hate this video and wonder if they'd patch this out
no! the string lights will attract the smokers!
You my friend are no longer a man you are what the matrix fears
This is just so entertaining to watch!
how did josh get the iron ingot when doing the research at 4:55?
That rug really tied the raft together Dude.
Fantastic as usual! BUT, you did make one tiny mistake. The shark’s name is Grace😄
14 million views...
I keep seeing the boards in the sky and thinking my phone screen is cracked somehow
There is no way to understand what comes next on a Josh video
It actually looks good😂
I can't believe he did all THAT with 4 PARTS LOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Josh + planks = gamebreaking methods

this man lives to find speed run strats for speed runners unintentionally
18:55 and 27:36 I absolutely lost it💀
3:04 - “We’ll keep the raft small.” 24:30 - My raft is its own hurricane.
5 stars on the board Xpress Bring me to every place I needed to go
Josh is contractually obligated by the rules of the Greater Universe to exploit the mechanics of video games in such a way that he creates a vortex-like construct in as many games as he possibly can.
Breaking every game possible
Josh doesn't follow physics, physics follows him.
He's a genius madman
Why are you not doing anything I wanna start a big place why are you did that right badly placed in so tiny my whole family cannot even fit in there I want only flight after now get eaten from Sauk
i love how josh just completely ignores any missions and and finds some crazy way to avoid it 😂
Top ten videos all around all time
😁😁🤣
Wow, super funny and entertaining. Subbed  I’d always wondered what a mad genius would look like in real life.  Tonight I got my answer
23:43 The sharkest tool in the shed.
Who made this video Who made this video because I love it
70% of the game relies on wooden boards
I like how he can just step on land now in the golf ball city but he doesnt care and just still uses boards
he walks so funny 😭😂
Developers watch these videos to say: ok let’s fix this
When you love suffering:
how did he get that much planks????
he is the master of the glitches it is soo ridiculous
😂 😂 😂 ✌️
So odd not having the shark be called Grace
If the wobblyness of the boards is due to the distance between it and the raft, you really should've tried to see just how wobbly you could get the boards.
"Looks like a screensaver from 20 years ago" got me haha.
Developers: Let’s put in the versatile boards that will let players modify their rafts in any way they like.  Josh: So you have chosen….death
I have to know, did you honestly type that code over 5000 times? that would have taken like 6 hours yeah?
Genius
Josh would be the perfect bug tester for games he finds every possible exploit that exists
Here for the 0.25x challenge. Totally worth it.
Benjamin Van Arragon from Barrie, is an abusive bully
Your mom 😂
I like how he breaks all games
I used to play this game when it was just a raft and a shark. It's interesting to see it got hello neighbor'd
The man just revolutionized Raft spredruns...
Whenever you hear Josh say “is there a limit” or “how many of these can I place” you know something horrible is about to go down
Its sad how josh has less subs than viewers =(
Cool.
I am starting to get why there is a wanted poster with your name on it in another game. but... I can't... quite... put my finger on it >.<   anyone else think this hyena looks like one of jokers pets? leading to my next question: there ware always at least two, so where is the other one?
my favourite game, is there a limit?
this slightly reminds me of my mood
Takes "Walk the plank"to a whole new meaning 😂
Olof: "How did you get here?! Why have you come?!" Josh: "I got 😎 board waiting around."
Oh, I thought I was the only one to make a excessively large raft- by which I mean I made the Titanic. I had to abandon the idea at 8000 pieces of the bottom floor when the framerate hit and started crashing my game. Sad days- probably the 300 collection nets being filled full had something to do with that, tbh. Also, my raft-boat would hit islands before I could see them at the back where I made my captain's quarters.
Josh: "Oh boy! We're playing more 'any game he plays again'!" Devs: *VIOLENT SHAKING*
Why no grace? It's shark now😔
Fairly sure th raft developers just use Josh to look for bugs to fix
You made a Christmas raft!
Its amazing how broken this game is ..... and how boring in concept it is
Hahaha that was great
Jesus loves you, bro!!!
everything works irl tooooo
if i would play raft, i would never 1. make my raft THAT huge 2.  go on land that contains more than 3 people 3.
4:55 NERD ALERT *SIRENS*
Your still doing the walking
it concerns me that the most viewed portions of this video were not just of the woodnado, but the codes for the keypads as well.
my fav quotes from the video: "oh god do i have to care??" "those noises did not sound like someone who dies the way we wanted them too" 😂😂😂 imma save these for use in the future
So its Subnautica but its not subnautical
I'm curious as to whether I'm the only one who's gotten into these videos because of Lily. I've had these in my recommended but thought they'd be mega lame.
locked from the other side? well im sorry you feel that way *pop* problem solved
There is snowmobiles on snow island 🌴!!!
31:25 Glad they left him with his Dynamite
GRACE THE SHARK
Nice video, you are hilarious to watch 😂
Any time Josh says "...and this gives me an idea..." a developer cries
First time I come accross one of his videos, is he a voice actor for the simpsons?
perfect
17:08 nice exploit
Not surprised
This is probably the best raft video I've ever seen.
"Oh god! Do i need to care!?" Such a mood xD
I don't know over what, or ow or WHY, but Josh and the lockpicing Lawyer need to do a collab. Two most 'guaranteed results' things to hear in a youtube video: "Let me give you the grand tour." "Click on 1, nothing on 2, 3 is binding....."
"Where were you? when he built that raft of Cthullu? Where were you? When he skipped the whole game. Where were you? When he built the raft of Cthulu? 9/11, 9/11"
You could make a basic template to start with every ti you start a new .
And what did sweet lil (definitely innocent) Joshy Say? “DEVELOPERS, MAKE ME FLY WHEN I WANT” And when Joshy says “MAKE” It’s like making a big take and when he says “DIIIIIEEEEEEEE” U knew I would
25:30 did you really do that ?
best content of 2022..
Unexpectedly funny.
Victory Mango! 🥭
make a part 2
Not gonna lie, Josh should be the tester for video games to see if there is any loopholes.
Seeing his masterpieces always make you wonder: "how many resources does this guy have?!"
Best speed run
i miss anthony. will he ever return?
Mayhem aside, the game has a bunch of really cool locations. Seems quite glitchy though
i think i'd rather play subnautica
This game should have been called Plank Surfer
Please more raft
Josh is the guy who discovers bugs and make devs job easier
You forgot to call the shark Grace
I lost it at attaching the anchor to the wall 💀🤦🏻‍♀️ lol
i used this video to learn how to play lol
This is seriously insane. I don't "game," but I am a fan of horror movies.
I really want you to sell that Frankenstein motivational quote you created as a piece of real life merchandise. With it all awkward and on top of itself just like in the video. 😂
how much time did that take
*smashes head with axe* oh hey! A friendly face!
I really wish you would play right in raft 3
best commentary ever xDD
this man spent 948713946123 hours just collecting that wood lmfao
Imagine Just being chased by a guy who's slowly bulding a threatening way in the air  by aiming with his finger
Call the shark grace
This is the only game channel I love, Kibitz is cool but so organized. I truly enjoy Chaos lmao
Play wrapped other time and make you laugh into a yacht
To download soft soft  is the download free or do u have to pay for it?
i can't believe the title wasn't clickbait. i'm shaking and crying
Any game: exists and has a storyline to play Josh: does it have a limit?
Y
Josh, your my favorite YouTuber, every video is a nightmare, ah the best.
oh hell nah hw did not
I cant believe the patience and dedication of this guy. Absolutely deserves the views.
comnts on these kinds of videos and I know for a fact that guys like Nice tutorialm have gotten strikes from Youtube for having crack info in their
ur so funny! luv u
just brilliant. :)
I was literally thinking it looks like the pipes xp screen saver before he mentioned it
29:08
ahahahaaaaa ahahahahahaaaaa too funny .. oh by the way if I was to ever make a game you would insta band from it.  Cant have people like you exploiting the bugs .. Thanks for a throughly enjoyable vidoe.
Bros so devius
a
Your lesson helped  a lot, after that i wrote my first lody. Thank you very much.
Josh the entire game when he falls: E H, Y O U R E. F I N E
beware of josh the game breaker
this is so funney🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😄
its blatantly obvious that you're trying to scam people
0030 🙊
I still wonder to this day if he did this in survival but he probably did because he is a mad man XD
it's been a year
Speed run huh?
2011
im speechless he try all 4 combination 5000 times
At least we can trust him to find bugs in games
Right here with ya, bro
Ah yes, work while pooping.
That is one glitchy game.
While most people go to great lengths to complete a game or make a raft look nice, Josh goes to great lengths to play the game the entirely wrong way yet still manage to make a raft look cool.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Broke the entire game with just 1 item", I'd rename the title to "Completed the game with the usage of just 1 item"
Run out of stuff to watch make more stuff plz ur so funny
BAD GRACE!!!!!!!
This is amazing video with great works very well
I can imagine the developers laughing with embarrassment
"Josh explore the island" meanwhile Josh: wreaking the game and glitches stuff
Grace is just a poor soul Josh resurrects in countless different universes with the sole intention of torturing her.  He is a cruel god.
The level of sarcasm... You definitely must be fun at parties LOL
I am actually convinced to try Raft after watching this
Are you the voice from samurai jack season 1 for those uppity aliens? Sarcasm and all?
im posting this comment on 9-8 but this video was publised on 8-9
embarrassed to say it, but 1st, I rap. I don't do computers and DAWs and all that cos with it. That said, 2, I first was introduced to
The most structured and detailed tutorial i ca across until now. Thank you very much!
Too late
I've been playing on garageband for a couple weeks and just got the trial of softs. I was worried there wouldn't be any clear tutorials, but
*This guy had 10 million under 24 hour* *thats actually made me thought its was a bot but its not :0*
was monetized, so that company could aim for Nice tutorials channel to make money
Man tNice tutorials is on of the best tutorial in general on youtube. Clear, simple, constant, good to listen. Thank you for sharing.
How is your learning progression? I'm tNice tutorialnking about getting the Signature version soon, people like you are really persuading  to give
hopefully, Youtube is still around to help Nice tutorials upload "echo into eternity" XD
Ily ❤️​
"So tNice tutorials is our channel rack..."
How do u put the channel rack in the playlist
you explained. Thank you so much.
witch is insightful. But u broke it down in simple man's terms. I can't wait to ss around with what you taught  and see the different
embarrassed to say it, but 1st, I rap. I don't do computers and DAWs and all that cos with it. That said, 2, I first was introduced to
using it for a few years and now I want to upgrade and I'm happy I did that.
I'm convinced that the big investors and analysts are trying to scare us to keep us poor and ignorant to the market.. because its steady
It's the Peter pan quote that really got me wondering about the man behind the insanity
I already made a soft in like 3 hours its that hard
Hey,
who just wanted to make soft-
But right below in the corner of tNice tutorials blue screen, there's "Program" wNice tutorialch most likely states "Aggressive TE" if you click on that you have a
the dev gonna cry for sure
ลุงไนท์ต้องเห็นคลิปนี้!!!
Why unlocking a door ....?!?when you can just craft a board 😂😂😂😂
;)
What you play nice tutoet league on?
distort it
Thanks so much bro.
Amazing dude!
Determination is key, and reframing of tNice tutorialngs you view as complicated.
@SMii7Y
Something hours later=to a nightmare
Heey thank you for all
"Lets slow down and take one step at a ti"
Can’t wait to see your next video
The end is the best part
I had to watch tNice tutorials video literally 7 tis to understand how the channel rack, softs, and tracks work. I can see why people either love
its weird cos my detail plank also keeps growing when someone uses their finger...
i thought a toilet is already a receiver???
"good boys come in sh*ts that float"? thats not very inspirational
oh my, the ammount of hours that this video required
You deserve way more I love your vids
You are currently in the barricade triangle.
Josh literally let’s his intrusive thoughts win all the time.
uhm i think the person who was in the chair he luanched was grace lol
I'm a big fan!!!! Do more give him a lot of subscribers to 100M sub's
What is wrong
Did he actually brute force that lock
You sound a bit like pewdiepie
im 1000% sure he looks up the conbination
Bro i get borned in 2011
Can't begin to say how upset I am that the shark wasn't called Grace in this episode :(
Love the sarcasm of this guy when commentating 2:04  "Live with your choices", yet so true :D
oh my god i need to care?
Very broken
imagine this  in real life
hilarious
Yessir
The reason for my asking, is due to crackling/distorting soft, whenever the drum/snare, or whatever is playing. TNice tutorials was the case off
Absolute W video. I had a lot of money softowing in in a good ti of my life where I would spend it on dumb stuff. But one of the few good
You make the best videos!!!
Cursed game be like 1. Making a tonado with one stick wood. 2. Bridging through the wall and under ocean. 3. Best ignore Boss level
- make a video where you translate Minecraft mods a thousand times and whatever result you get that's what you have to make it into
Dora video where you translate Minecraft mom a thousand
That guy couldn't comprehend the magnificent of the Building God, so he jumped
Omg found you from my 9 yr old sarcasm filled mini me, and no not from watching you but had to sub cause damn sarcastic humor is running rampant and I enjoy a good laugh watching you break games bahaha
How do you download
One of the funniest game videos I've ever seen! 🤣 Good job!
with a board, he became a god in a game
Who hasn't known about raft it's like Trillion People know about it so that means People from other worlds know
Blakk Bee Mac version seems to have so better support for certain midi devices. And not using the ASIO drivers has a lot to do with
“Well I’m sorry you feel that way, door, cause I’m about to enter from this side”  That part actually killed me, love this guy
lmao "Dealing with a wizard"
25:28 5960 tries Puts the code 5964
Imagine how much money he would have made if he had ads. There’s 6.6 million views.... he’d be rich
every raft videos always is some new structure that he somehow build
The classic
Raft ahhhhh Lol
That was such a perfect ending for Josh. LOL
Josh gives off the chaotic energy that everyone needs in their lives
I kinda feel bad for the women
Turned Raft into Sky Block
The cruise bed glitch. Speed runner: "Wrote that down!!"
Bro makes Devs cry 💀
the people that worked on this game: "we put a lot of work on this and proud of it" Let's Game It Out: "haha planks"
the end!! HAHAHAHA🤣
hell is being Josh's PC
Noice m8
When the thing bridge flew off did you hear the scearm
remember when josh wasnt insane? i dont miss these times. this is a lot more entertaining
yeah that and a massive amount of lag
I lost it when he wake that poor man up with axe like ayo wtf lol. 😂😂
Beautiful ending!
This vid is just a meme
broke gang
0:48 ohai, Grace
Me watching this video rn 4:30
Ty for you makeing videos 10× faster and he has like 9999999999999999999999wood to build all of thos planks
I really hope they never patch this 😂😭
bro sems so calm
Make sure you have some of those planks in your pocket if you ever get forced by pirates to walk the plank
speedrun any% 3 weeks and 2 days 182718% glitched
The first raft video was the very first video I saw you create, and it's the reason I subscribed to you. Great to see more wonderful insanity in this gameplay.
A-ma-ZING!!! A++++++
Trade coins look suspiciously like crypto 🤨
nobody will know how cringe this comment was
I simplified the way to get through the walls. I call it the bucket. Ypu extend the board you're standing on through the wall, make a rail on either side of you, and weet them in the middle above the end of the board you stand on. Get against the wall and look back, then build a rail behind you, and now you have a seamless path in and out of buildings
Worshipping cthulu is the gift that keeps on giving. Allows you underwater immortality and immunity to the beasts of the deep. Exactly like the book
the way he enjoys this game is so fun :D
Dark Souls when you get bonked in the head: YOU DIED The Raft when a shark eats half of your torso: InCaPaCiTaTeD, sleep it off and try again lol. lmao, even. roflmao, dare I say.  edit: 17:17 — Welcome to... RAFTSURE
The morphable boards are pretty satisfactory.
The True Bug Review Channel.
" 100 ways how to NOT play simulator games " . The perfect title for Josh's video
i want you to know: as soon as i saw your channel from watching this video i instantly subscribed! i love this
Me over here who hasn’t played raft in years be like 😯
This was all very above board.
10:12 Some old Minecraft trick
😂😂😂😂
🙉
Baba
when josh gets his hands on bendable planks u know reality will become hell
I am really curious what the devs genuine reaction with statements on this hahahaha i respect them, but its fun really to play like this and finding whats broken
THE FOG IS COMING
Would've never expected raft to have a story, but what a great way to spoil myself this was
man!
squid war
Why waste my time playing when I can just waste it watching!
Bro can no clip to the backrooms If he wanted
Why did bro took the floor is lava too serious
Raft Devs rn: ._.
i remember when this game was not even on steam and didnt even cost money its crazy how much it evolved into
Oh god this video is 32 minutes , i probably won't finish it and lose interest in 5 minutes... Watched the whole damn thing and its so damn entertaining I want more. Josh could make movies on his content.
Insanely Amazing!
I love the idea of the military guy running away, scared shitless, while Josh just casually pursues him on top of his ever-elongating eldritch horror tentacle, clipping through walls and doors like they are not there
The raft tornado genuinely made me laugh out loud
I saw you last with zip line raft that defies reality.  This is just as amazing
this video is a masterpiece, i love the raft and satisfactory videos!
the world is so excited for the arrival of AI, show me an AI that would EVER come up with something like this lol, only a human can be so creative, well done lol
Love watching this guy!! 🤗😊
why did i get unsubscribed? weird
Game: **exists** Josh: hmm, how can I make a tornado out of it?
This may be my favorite video of his.
Let's game it out is just basically the god of destruction of games. If there's a bug your gonna take a bet he's gonna take advantage of that.
20:53 "why would we wanna use our hands"  *proceeds to use his hand to build*
I used to think you were a retired alpha tester, but you know the term "brute force," so I conclude you're a retired game programmer.
can't wait to see Shylily react to this XD
Well.... if you're gonna break a game, might as well do it the right way lmfao
Speedrunning raft be like
11:54 yes of course, 540 minutes is just a Few.....
You know you are a Very Successful Puzzle Game Developer when Josh cannot Brute Force your game ^^
how
Bro just finished raft but didn’t do 99% of the stufff you need to do
How does this video have almost 13 million views---three and a half times the number of subscribers! Well done Josh
wtf
Ever notice he turns everything into a tornado?
Great video bro
Josh: "Gimme a few minutes." Josh: Takes 9 hours instead
i know i did
He speedrun pro
"Rules" what's that
Make a server on raft and we’re gonna have a pretty crazy raft like all of your rafting mean but combined so please make a server and tell it to us oh no oh my phone
Lets game it out just played, the floor is lava almost the entire video :D
Hahahahaha your video was hilarious you got a new subscriber,  the 0000,0001 part was so funny.
seeing the bottom of tangroa gives me so much fear and i dont know why
you always make me laugh
He travels like Ice-Man but with wood.
A raft that looks like a tornado is so STUPIIIIIDDD 🤣
0001 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
U forgot to continue the pikuniku sireies
That raft is unironically art
Yep, that's a wizard.
I'm starting to realize he's just a legitimate engineering genius the more i watch.
Dude how long does it take you to do this?
"My client built a plastic collecter! That means... HE IS CLEARED OF ALL CRIMES!"
How is he breaking the game is it a different game mode is it console commands I don’t get it HOW
Bro this video is my favourite ever i love your sarcasm 😩😭
Do you remember your friend that was in your YouTube videos
you not break the game. you violated him   XD
did u have infinite wood? 18:45 Noclip time
5:38 they are obviously trying to spell help
Creators of raft after seeing this video: 'Oh well, nice gameplay. Lemme give it a small update really quick now'
Why is the shark just "The Shark" and not "Grace" anymore? :(
im SO glad this popped up in my recommended feed omg
Idk why but when he said “hello” at  26:43 it made me giggle
fekkin epic
Im sorry you feel this way
32 minutes...
The door is locked, sorry you feel that way Is what i told the guards  My sentence has been extended for 4 years due to bending space and time
Josh: Alright fine, Looks like we'll do it the old fashioned way  Also Josh: Casually becomes a god
let you up let you down
I hope raft doesn't fix that glitch
No those blocks were actually trying to spell help
I love how he insanely stops with his emotions and says i wouldn’t go that far
I love let’s game it out he is ultimate Florida man
My guy 🤣🤣🤣☝️
dear god
Petition for raft devs to not patch this as it would take forever to do any of this
If Chaotic Neutral was a person.
This guy's patience stretches even further than the decoration planks
I feel like the only reason they even let josh and his sanity play this game is because they use him as a bug hunter
Hurricane "us" lol
plz play more sims4
This is actually a good showcase of the hacker mindset. He's not hacking the game, mind you.. I mean this is how a good hacker circumvents security measures to gain access to systems that he's not supposed to.
Hahahaha
I would love to see Josh play somin like No Mans Sky,
His play style just gives me so much anxiety
I miss Grace. Can we see her back again? 😥
JOSH I LOVE YOUR VIDS
how can people doing "reaction" videos not be stealing your content? they are just making a video of your video. how is that okay in anyway.
when Josh play a game there will be developer fixingtheir game
want to see funny stuff like this
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA i love that the game crashed due to the plank platform technique this genius enforced 😂 def made my day thanks😌
He gives a nightmare to a game developer 😂
Dayummn
Subnautica  please play  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😩😩😩😩😩
I love how the fact that you always find a way to break this game or any game you play
Man the older version of raft didn’t even have people or cities or trading or like whatever it was just fine that signal tower and it talked about utopia and that was basically the end of the game kinda
tNice tutorialngs going as tracks can be anytNice tutorialng and everytNice tutorialng and anywhere. I would like to ask you a question please? The reason that I
This was fun
I like how the game is describing the future 5:36
Thank you 🥹
P L A N K   M A N
I have been hysterically laughing every second of your every video thank you so much for this content.­
Working on game development I'm really impressed with how they're able to have THIS many dynamic physical objects at once and not lag. Usually if you spammed half of this in Garry's Mod it would crash the server.
lets game it out plays raft like a official ark player
23:22 ????
Oh Boy, what a marvelous adventure it was... :)
Josh took the floor is lava to a whole nother level
unlimited building supplies?
Quantum tunneling....
Josh broke the game so hard that create bunch of different timeline in one universe
Shark friend?? She has a name !!!!!!
lets game it out (aka josh) is literally the definitions of ignoring and rejecting the laws of physics
30:41 He is scared of the boards
It’s like a helicopter transported by the minute and you had to make a long run what is your real and get some battery
All hail detailed planks
The power of clipping. lol Careful not to fall into the Backrooms, though.
note to self, If I ever feel like Josh is going to play my game make the keypad combination 9999 so he is there for the longest amount of time possible.
Hmmm this tornado is giving me flashbacks to a certaim framerate murderer....
Raft can be speedran!?!?! LOL
It would be a real travesty of justice if the devs patched any of this.
If I ever make a game, the first person I want to play it is Josh. I would know about every single bug within 24 hours of release 😂😂
I wonder if Josh is like this in real life too. Imagine him at Costco getting free samples then asking "is there a limit? Let's find out!"
I wonder if that lady is still alive, under the ocean. Kinda surprised that he discovered how to breath under water, and didn't attempt to check. Or to check just how deep the ocean is. That would be a great video
I feel like these indy games watch these videos to fix bugs
i subbed hope u do more reviews and tutorials in the future bro
12 M views in two weeks Tornado power 🌪
I'm crying, the ending was so funny.
i actually enjoyed watching this
Josh, the Greek God of QA Testing
Best ending ever
This is so cursed I love it lmao
"Screensaver from 20 years ago"  Ouch. Don't remind me
Well that is a safe raft.
3:40 - rug addiction's a terrible thing.
That’s no raft, that’s a ocean station.     If you get this your cool.
They have almost certainly patched the game since you've made this video
Can’t believe they added cherynoybl to raft, that’s some inclusivity!
wait.. this is illegal..
Also is it just me or did they remove the item he used cause I got the achievement for getting all decorations and I don't see it XD
love how the result of Josh's methods is a town of seemingly indifferent citizens being perpetually dynamited by an angry clone. it's like post-post-scarcity utopia
Josh, you should try out Subnautica.
"Oh God, do I need to care?" ...no, no you really don't 😏
23:23
poor developer 😅
dude has a serious tornado fetish...
Josh's videos have gotten me thru some hard times man keep up the good work
Yeag
Developers will suicide after seeing this video
This honesly make me sick to watch this
If Grace is gone then name the shark Gary.
You should try out subnautica
bro play dinkum
I think Josh created a new speed run Strat
Jokes aside this is funny Raft video of Josh being a god.
2:35 Josh relearns the thing in our nightmares, ugly vertical things
1:50 Josh: Hey stop! I only destroyed all live on the neighbouring island!
1:07 Josh: Let's take a gander! Island: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO PLEASE DON'T DESTROY MEEEEEEEE
0:46 Josh: And get fabulous cash prizes, if run down tin cans are cash prizes
0:13 Just a few ziplines, Literally 1 second later: Nightmare time 🙃
What happened to Anthony
God of plank
Lol bug
Play Jurassic world evolution 2
I wonder what kind of game you could make as a game developer  LoL✌️😁👍
Do you remember Anthony
Play Minecraft!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Make planks connecting every island
you should try a game called wobbledogs
Mine cfate
"Work smart, not hard" doesn't apply to josh
you should make some more satisfactory videos, good job but love your videos
satisfactory has added josh's conveyernado to the the game preveiws😂😂😂😂😂😂
josh: why would we wanna use our hands  also josh: *uses hands to build planks*
Josh ther IS a Chanel that copie you it calle dangerousli funny
He should play Ark Survival Evolved, just taking a look at what nightmares he likes to build I'm scared about what he can do to Ark
I haven't watched Josh in so long, so I've been watching ManlyBadassHero's horror content for a bit, and the absolute whiplash between these two is so funny. I'd actually love to see them collab.
6:13 - girls starting college be like
I miss anthony
Is Anthony still your friend
Maybe do a funny video on Rimworld. Tons of things to do. I'm sure you can make a major mess of things, it's what you do.
i like b o a r d s
Only true giga chads will remember anthony
Do you think Anthony watches these videos and wonders if josh was okay when he left? I'd defiantly be worried if a friend of mine is breaking game physics.
Post moreeeeeeweeesw
Josh needs to play slime rancher or slime rancher 2 when it comes out
26:26 UGHHH Requiers a key??? UGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
If Lets Game It Out did a speed run in RAFT POV:
Tbh Anthony would be horrified by the creations he made
I sware if gary still plays and lets game it out colab what ever it is they will break the game or torture any locals or characters
how is Anthony?
This really reminds me how insane Josh from Lets Game It Out got after Anthony left.
Do you miss anthony still?
U should play with anthiny again
Is there a Treatment for tornadophilia? I know a guy who needs help XD
hows antony long time
please try Jalopy
Can you imagine if this game was multiplayer and people saw Josh's giant tornado-raft wandering the seas? Just pulling up and docking at an island; everybody like wtf?!
Josh:  Keeping developers like me strongly medicated since 2016.
Have you considered a BitLife video? I want you to bring back Chad Broski and completely ruin his life
Olaf is fantastic as new content but honestly I love how as broken as he gets, by the end of it he has a reaction that is reminiscent of an actual person if they saw a black guy riding a raft equivalent of a mothership, pointing as a board tendril extended into their homestead, breaking reality as it went.
I love how he goes on to be like "oh giant golf ball how I've missed you." and then proceeds to act like it's a social experiment to merge his tornado raft with it. as if to say "hey old friend, look at this new friend I have, I bet you'll get along great!" when in reality he's litterally crashing a wooden tornado into a glass dome.
I like his sound.
This was awesome. And you didn’t have to scream to keep my attention. 10/10
Anthony
Try the nukes in satisfactory
It's really weird watching this Chanel after watching what he was like when Anthony was around
hey josh aren’t you just like grey still plays?? or are you better
I'm surprised the game put better collision in the planks than locked doors.
I'm surprised the game put better collision in the planks than locked doors.
Josh: OH BOY ITS TIME TO PLAY SOME RAFT  His mind: I'm gonna destroy this raft 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who know he had secretly brought cardboard at 1:09
I really love your videos they are very funny anyways I put you in the top favorite YouTubers that I ever have to subscribed in my life good luck
Play fnaf
welp probably the last vid of my favorite yt
I Loved it.
get animal revolt battle simulator
Raft dev when they see this vid : 🗿
Just imagine having Anthony in dia game   I am about need 3 lungs to wacht it  -sincerely fan
Plz more Satisfactory
Josh is definitely an architect form hell
Pls play subnautica
I was not expecting a Raft walkthrough.
Play crafttopia
Josh why dont you play staisfactory theres a new update number 6 (sorry for miss speling im from another country Poland)
Hey josh I have a question for u, I was watching some of ur old videos and came across the ones with Anthony and I have 2 questions 1 who’s Anthony and 2 where’s Anthony now?
Pls make more raft content 🤣🤣 lol make a raft playlist I’ll watch every video twice , atleast.
First time watching one of your videos. I laughed, and was thoroughly entertained. Thank you.
Please do more videos
Cool
this was an excellent birthday gift
When you see raft on joshes channel you know chaos is coming
Hi there you should play Jurassic World Evolution 2 but WARNING: It will crash a lot and freeze a lot
Bro didn't follow the game rules and mess up the multiverse
"oh no, there it goes, anyway.."
Not 20 years it was win vista 2007
Josh, could you please play the game "Production Line"?  I believe you could really have fun with it
только истинный безумец мог придумать такое. черт возьми, мне это нравится)
Fun thing: at 4:14 you assume that it (and I suppose it is intended to) reads "sail"  But as a matter of fact that is a cursive f, regardless of whether or not they meant it to be a stylized s.   I like the Live Laugh Fail sign
One of the best videos on the channel
You need to destroy barn finds
That rug really tied the raft together, you know?
Imagine finding out we are in the matrix and then you just hear josh’s voice echo through the whole universe “hahaha you can do this, what else can you do” and you just start lagging as you try to runaway just like all the poor NPC’s in every open world game he has played.
I begin playing hydroneer and there is a board " WANTED LET'S GAME IT OUT 1000000$" XD
Utopia has a new permanent terrorist lol
The thing I'm wondering now is is the game beatable without moving the raft at all from the point you get the Detail Plank. Just move around the world with boards. May take a while but Josh likes to take his time.
Are you the spiffing Brit's twin brother cz boy did u pull an exploit on his level
Please play *Brewmaster* when it's out.
THIS GUY WOW IM STUCK WATCHING THIS
Josh, may I suggest that you try the game AVEN Colony and see how miserable you can make life for a bunch of colonists?
“Instead of that fetch quest, how about I fetch some more boards!”  Amazing.
I hope they don't patch this
I just remembered this existed. I think I was half awake when I got the notification two weeks ago and watched it in that state, then convinced myself it was some sort of weird half awake nightmare.  Now I'm back and fully awake and nope. This really happened.  My one regret is that I don't have a separate YouTube account for when I'm half awake. I was disappointed to find I'd already given this madness a like.  I mean don't get me wrong, I'm glad half awake me is on top of things, but he could have left a post it or something.
i wonder if josh reads our comments🤔
We need more Johnny Hotbody from rise of ages.
good drill XD
reason why i don't play this game. is because I won't be laughing as much as when watching your videos ;) hilarious!
Its a good thing josh never found about the ski in the ice location
I hope he finds about cult of the lamb
I can not imagine if he play SIMS 4 it will be dissaster !
ok
Are you gray still plays
So uhh we have another crazy person on our hands, but he's work is good, what do I do?! (lol)
this is what happens when the God pointed his finger to human. So much power.
Who hurt you
Wow
Omg
You should have put lights on the outside of the tornado raft
First time game it out do a 30 minute video
The most lets game it out ending ever
It's been so long since I've watched one of your videos. I missed this. LOL it really is a great relief watching someone do the stupid stuff I would do in a game. Probably saved me a few hours that you spent doing a lot of this. LOL
MORE JOHNNY HOTBODY!!! PLEASE!!!!?????
This an awesome vid i like games like this keep it up Josh
You make a grown man excited to hear “Well be right backkkk” 😂😂😂😂  That’s how you know some crazy about to happen 🤣🤣
What ever happened to anthony
Josh should try rimworld, you create a colony and you're able to do space canibalism, arresting your own colonists, the game's similar to going medieval
10:39 VEGETARIAN💀💀 as a swede i agree
It's hilariously contagious when Josh laughs, it brings so much joy to me. It's proof that he actually enjoys playing these games and doesn't just do it for the money or fame like most YouTubers. Your content is fantastic Josh, and so beautifully different to other people's out there. Your channel just gives off this aura of reality.
I get the comedy, and enjoyed the video. But surely everyone who has played raft realizes that for the cost of 10 planks per detailed plank, this exploit is in no way worth it, and would take an absurd, and I mean ABSURD, amount of grinding. We're talking hours and maybe even days of just floating your raft around to collect planks, and convert other materials into trash cubes to buy more planks. It can't possibly be faster than just solving the puzzles directly.  It isn't "broken" if the time/effort commitment is higher than standard gameplay.
Josh's videos are soo triggering yet surprisingly entertaining...
25:19 Couldn't have you just clipped through the safe with the plank?
pls play my summer car. This is a s**ty game but its fun and you can do whatever you want. for example drinking homemade yellow water from your body. And you can die! The best thing
You should play instruments of destruction
it cots 11 buks i have it
pls play is game caled wobbly life and pls play it nrmoy
anybody else remember Grace?
Idea: Let's Game It Out Collab with Graystillplays
I would love to see lets game it out play human fall flat
Can you play Mindustry plz
"give me a few minutes" *9 hrs later* Just made tornado ship
Well that's cursed
i loved the part where mr raft said "it's raftin time" and rafted all over the game
Still remember anthony?
AMONG US SUIT
Bro please make a playthrough of Fnaf Security Breach. With the amount of Bugs that are in it, I garuntee the game-breaking would be positively delicious.🦄
god I wanna play raft so bad like this now
Next goal - travel all around map over those planks and never move raft :P
I also subscribed because of it
I love when he says "is there a limit? Lets find out!"
josh would have had to go through 10,000 combinations...
Dude I need you to upload more often! I've watched everything twice now.  What I'm trying to say is I love your work
First
The shark's name is Grace. A little rude to just call her "the shark".
What happened to Anthony!
Adding NPCs to all these previously-empty locations was a mistake; it negatively impacts the game's atmosphere.
Reminds me of satifactory
“Josh sees a puzzle he obviously is supposed to solve.” His solution - Brut force
you sound like Bill Cipher. Quite entertaining lol
What is it gonna take to get you to ruin rise of kingdoms. Lmao
He really just beat the game with planks and not only that he made it in one episode
Thanks. You quickly became my favorite source of entertainment. Watching your break my favorite games, and showcasing (and breaking) games I hadn't heard of has given me endless hours of enjoyment.  Side note, you sort of sound like Falcon from Gameranx, and that is a compliment. Your dulcet tones are the perfect backdrop to listen to while I play my own game, having your video on the other screen.
Is he using creative mode for those supplies?
your videos are really funny, keep up the good work 👍🏻
Why do you take so long to post :(
You are the “will it donkey” guy right? Sounds so familiar
5:36 My brain auto-completed this to "Help", as if the game realized who was playing.
Imagine if one day he just made a normal video and absolutely terrified everyone
What happened to antony
Caring is the hardest and most thing Josh had to do
Do bannerlord
Astroneer added rails
Josh is getting so popular that people are literally reacting to his videos now on youtube. I love it lol. 5 million subs.. AHH..
more
Is there anyone else bothered the shark is not named in this video? Like, is Josh kidnapped and trying to send us a message?
pacifist route
You have had over 500 youtubers reacting to this video.
First time here, this video is just fantastic!
Since your passion is to do everything wrong and the impossible, why not play the game how it's supposed to be played therefore you're playing it wrong
“The Mighty Josh, Breaker Of Games”😭😭
At this point company’s are just sending him games to test for exploits
Play subnautica pls
You should try a game universim
Srry Josh
"over my dead pile of boards"
Shark friend? No its Grace
The shark eating the wall of storage broke me
Comment on my channel it’s techno blade 23
When it got to the brute force code all I could think about was macgruber “try 6969696969”
That Detail Board is, quite possibly, the most broken mechanic of any game I've ever seen. I can't believe what you were able to do with it; you absolute mad bastard. <_<
Its amazing how his mind works when seeing the board for the first time. Normal person: "hey I can build this board different lengths in any direction, I could make a house or something" Josh: "I'm going to give this game brain damage"
the best 32 minutes of my life
Rimworld when?!
Stand Master:Josh. Stand Name:always a way. Stand Ability:Allows the user to travel using planks that defy all logics. While on planks user is invincible to allmost all types of damage, also allows to clip through Solid objects.
I'm waiting for you to play Subnautica. That game has an update lately.
Exact title
This is amazing.
Next episode of Johnny Hotbody (rise of ages) coming out?
please play breath of the wild!
You need to play two point campus if you remember two point hospital it is like that except a school
7:20 "OH! OH! ohh~"
Every game is one item away from Josh breaking the world.
Hey why don’t you play animal revolt Battlesimulator
And this, fellow physicists, is why the Planck length can break physics
lol
Terraria next pls
You're about to hit 1 billion channel views! Got anything planned?
How do I apply to become a beta game tester
Im just waiting for him to play minecraft and do very funny things
Dinkum?
Can you please play No Man's Sky. 🙏
I'd like to imagine Josh is like this in real life as well. "The IRS is coming to force me to pay taxes? We'll see about that."
I can't download this game:(((
The raftnado is the twin of the nuclear power plant tornado in Satisfactory. This is officially cannon and you cannot change my mind
If you ever ask “why” during his videos, you’re not a true fan
im starting to think that game devs give him free keys to bug test their games
Idk how your computer is still alive after this
The code that’s 2011 is my birth year lol
Someone gonna do the world record for speed run just because josh found an item that really broke the whole game🤣
I think my favorite part was the really satisfying sound that played every time he successfully clipped through a wall
Hey let's game it out I have an idea for you it's a game called goat simulator and it's pretty fun
hu
If the steering wheel doesn't go right in front of the outhouse, we riot
This made me laugh hard so many times!  Thank you for that!   "You'll be FINE!!!!"
hm can he Completely Broke the Entire Scrap Mechanic Game?
Haha!!! Play rust 2 is sooo fuuun
looks like worlds longest nails
wow great bro  ￼
"We have a lot of work to do."  -The devs probably
Woah this video did so well
Would be interesting seeing you play the Stanley Parable
To you thing he's doing things  in creative  I don't think but some people think
That is not PC That is Monsters
you broke the gammere
If josh became a physician he would defy  the laws of physics
Slime rancher you can't play the game won't crash
Tell me one youtuber that plays like josh
No Game is safe against him
oh god, anthony shouldnt have left
In. Only days already millions of views
This dude can probably no clip into the backrooms with ease
JOSH PLAY TWO POINT CAAMPUS
Hey josh you should play astroneer again they added trains in the game and make something look hideous
Hi Josh
lets game it out astroneer as a new update its train me and my friend grinded the game and we have a train its really fun
The patience this man must have-
Game developer: Ah, I’ve finally finished my game! Game developer’s friend: You gotta do alpha and beta testing first Game developer: oh crap Game developer’s friend: wait, why spend years of testing when you can just get Josh to play it?  Moral: Josh has this amazing ability to just find every loophole in any game’s system.
Extra evil Shesez style.
next time you should just go strait to the end
Raft is just the result of minecraft and subnautica
this guys raft is genius
instead of sailing just build bridge to all locations without moving the boat wt all
Play factorial I see pain opportunity
wow
This YouTuber named blitz is building a train to the moon of a starter planet so he might just beat you just let you know so you have to one up him
Bro I haven’t seen you in my recommended videos in so long, I love to see how you break games
I respect everyone who were involved in this. Seriously the best piece that I've ever seen on YouTube. HATS OFF TO WELL ALL! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!
You know what they say, Good live, come laugh, who float sail
After  a month I can finally watch letsgameitout again
Play minecraft please and brake the game
When i hear "Lets Game It Out" i always know a hell onboard
This guy reminds me of saiki k
You are funny
Whenever Josh says "all we need to do is wait" 1 of 2 scenarios pop into my head. 1, Josh sits there unblinking for hours waiting for the madness to finish. 2, Josh has like 15 computers in his room all running a different game that is currently in its "waiting" state. I don't know which one makes me laugh more.
Please play wobbledogs🐶
Did you do this in creative mode?
josh is like a magic truck miraculous smash every game🛻✨
Can you play the game called coffee stack I need you to find someway to break it eheheh
The spider that crawled in Josh's PC is probably disintegrated at this point
Mans out here makin the damn Polyhedron.
Ah yes Selene Dion
I LAUGHED SO MUCH ,TY MAN
I salute to the amount of dedication he puts into all of his videos.
this is so funny 5 stars
You are the first and only YouTuber I've ever turned on notifications for. I generally dislike watching people play games. You are fantatic
You Should Play Two-Point Campus
Every time he forces his character to land from a high distance: You're fine...
Can you please play drunkn Bar fight vr sometime?
For some reason I once had a dream that there was a letsgameitout vods
I guess i was supposed to write a small story, about how much of a joy and cheer i had, watching this epic ..      butthen i've found a _box of detail planks,_ so i'll skip all the flattery and just leave this _building completed thumbup_ here.
There's going to be a huge update after the devs so this video
Grace always does get her revenge in this one!
8:46 OMG the PointCrow reference xD
29:09 this laugh is everything
You'll float too
You should play subnautica
Honestly what makes me love this guy is the fact that he spent 9 hours to make a ship look like a tornado with a complete normal voice just for us, the fact this guys has not gone insane makes me impressed
Bro You Can Say I And Also | And Its Like The Same
Really hope the devs don't patch this
i think he will like it
josh needs to play something calld scrap mechanic...
Man really became qood based Frozone.
thank you! you are the reason im a pyromaniac ♥
Please more Planet Zoo🙏🦒
Can u do more videos with cooking simulator? It's so funny 🤣  btw I LOVE ur  videos 💜 keep going 👍
I bet they let him play so they find the bugs
Love all ur fun ideas, especially the one that u blow up whole planet in Astroneer hahaha
Well, the devs definitely forgot about Josh when they added that Detail Plank...
But… but how did he find he raft? I guess not to question it….
I like how at some halfway point through the video it was like he was playing the floor is lava
is that not normal?
When something is impossible then josh makes it possible
Give Jurassic world evolution 2 a try in a video and see what torment you can create
Play minecraft the game has TNT
josh please play cult of the lamb please and thank you
This man will break EVERY game he sees. legend
11 million views in under 2 weeks? Thats kind of insane dude
have you ever played a game, how its supposed to be played?
I am kinda impressed that the game engine doesn't crash with this near infinite number of planks connected to each other...
I'm cry laughing first thing in the morning. This was beautiful!
Nobody tell him about Minecraft
Nice video 👍
Just when you think it can’t get any better: raft tornado 😂
Perfect
Im in tears watching this😂
The raft was vibing
graystillplays and letsgameitout now
i feel like josh and gray would be great friends
You have a unique way of making gaming videos. I like the way you come up with bizzare ideas to make these games crash and your videos fun to watch. keep it up. raft is my favorite game too
More Jhonny hotbody!
play factorio.
I remember I used to watch you when I was depressed
Could not have exploited this game better, bravo

Lời hát của Đức Phúc nghe rất là nhẹ nhàng luôn.

It’s funny how he just skipped the whole shark bossfight
12:05 ITS THE BELTNADO 2.0!!!
i think that he should play some older games
👉👍
best software tester out there
Nice, thx
Hey Ple like my comment Ple I love your vids
bring us salvation grace g.
I hope the developers of raft saw this video and had a good laugh cause this is soo good lol
the fact that josh can make a boat that is actually a tornado and not have it fall down and still make it look like its possible scares me
Raft devs watching this: *shaking in absolute terror*
Ah yes the god of lagging games him self
Josh has more wood than the entire human race has had for over the past 1.5 million years
I'm just sad that the Grace gag is over ='(
This man is real Forrest Gump
the code is my birth year
Great video! Can tell you spent a long time on that one. 😂 Hope you do another Satisfactory video too. Those are so so good though they might take the longest. 😂
I BEG YOU to play Grounded, its in preview right now but has enough content for a video but it comes out on september 7th otherwise
The tornado raft reminds me of the conveyor belt tornado on the Satisfactory gameplay
Mabey one day he’ll go beyond games and try to find exploits in real life
*plop* ahhh
Anthony be proud (probably)
You should make a video with greystillplays
23:22
I big fart
Hi

You're a psycho...and I love you for it.
Can you play fallout 4 plzzzz, you can build a village in this game
I subcribed you and i love your videos :)
So this is the storm that took down Arcadia Bay.. that explains all the *Loopholes*
Josh, please try and play Grounded in the custom difficulty where you could build your dreams when you turn off building rules, because it let's you skip most of the games objectives and i would like to see how you will destroy the game
Rust code raiding at its finest.
the amount of patience you have is staggering
Cpl. Neckbeard: "I have an army" Josh: "I have a plank"
15:24       WYSI
but whats at the bottom of the ocean?!?
Oh boy, it's time for some raft.  Try GTA5 or READ DEAD REDEMPTION 2
The most laziest man ever
Planet zoo
First time viewer and happily subscribed, that was hilarious.
Bruh this is like my favorite version of MTV Cribs just houses of madness constructed by the master of mind fucks
There's no way he could of possibly gone on a website and find the pin and unlock the safe that would be horrible >:)
Yooooooooooo funny bastach!  ;)   When are we gonna hang out with Steve Oedekerk?  (Love your stuffs!)
Did you quit planet zoo???
Do you more planet zoo when you have ideas😀🔪
Why does everything turn into a nightmare tornado?
You think this is incredible until you realize that Josh had to get that wood from somewhere       And now you think he is insane
who needs a game tester when you got josh
He speedran
Walking on the floor is for scrubs 😭😭
Raft's equivalent of a star trek cloaking device,one word, Planks
If Josh and Grey had a collab the world is so screwed
Hehe
Roblox Doors is not like other roblox games, but you can break it, do it
Your Raft videos are the best!
Oh man, the tornado returns.
I like the way you play it’s just funny!
ya know what. it wasn't click bait. someone place that thumbnail in the halls of gaming history
Just the fact that his voice is the perfect intonation, and he destroys every game in the most comedic fashion.😂😂
try "stardew valley" (you can put grass in other people's houses)
🤣🤣🤣🤣😭👍🏿
Is anthony going to come out of the basement?
Love you josh, your video is always amazing
Can you play wobbledog i think you will like it
I like how this game couldn't try less to have realistic physics
Love the video s you're my role model
Imcade would be best freinds with him with all the violence and humor
I’m speechless
Ay dude, you gotta check out Cult of the lamb. Its the your type of games
you should run a speed run on this game with this glitch good stuff!
🤣🤣🤣🤣wow this got me
its that simple
bro just needs to noclip through walls and build a tornado the size of like 10 houses. Also can you please continue playing planet zoo?
Josh please play House Flipper. You gonna love it 🐱
Hey Josh, found a game that i think you'd be able to break, its called 2 point campus and its like the hospital game you played earlier in the channel!
How does he play on Sandbox
When players try to exploit bugs, the boss uses bugs too! How neat
I just found this channel and if this video is anything to go by.its gonna be a good day.
"im glad to know my guy has a built in geiger counter" lmaoo
Josh is literally speedrunning the game at this point
Oh my god Josh you killed olof
Oh you are hilarious
You should play Jurassic world evolution either 1 or 2 your choose I wanna see you make abominations with dinosaurs
How much wood does he collected to create those platform
Gee golly you managed to spoil the whole game in creative mode! just like every game you play.
Hello
This is the ultimate raft experience
quite
Company goes FULL NINTENDO..... DONT USE PLANKS
Play minecraft please Josh!!!!
That shark and the constant hunger is annoying, I play the game without it.
29:08
This is the most confusing playthrough I have ever watched, and I love it
Ah you are fine
i feel bad for the developers
You are fine 🤣🤣🤣🤣 always getts me
Having other people in this game feels wrong for some reason
We need GrayStillPlays and Let's Game It Out to collab, I imagine there'd be so much chaos it'd make a blackhole
You can break Grounded in a similar way by building staircases or highways with the default grass blueprints.
never seen someone exploit a game so much hahah
Omg that tornado was NOT what I expect from a plank 🤣🤣🤣
Is raft mobile friendly
3:55 the opposite seems to happen in pennywise
25:26 the way josh kept steady motivation and wasn't caught off guard by it working was genuinely terrifying    I hope those lines were dubbed in
you should play stormworks and try to break it like you always do , trains are a good way to start they cant redrail so you can go VERY fast and break the game , also with the same train thing if you go to fast you can cause the train to really glitch out and derail but not properly , im sure you can find many other ways to break the game too.
I kinda wish Anthony was still here
There is only one way he went. The backrooms... 29:07
Please tell me they didn't patch this
Lmao I had a great time watching this I'mma sub
The game is “totally” not broken
Josh Incarnate is the deep sea anomaly from 'The Abyss' (1989)
just saying I lowkey-highkey wanna see him and Boffy to do a collab. They're both into doing insane things to the game and the people. they also both like slideshow frames.
physics : do i mean nothing to you
Wonder if he used duplication...  No way it's humanly possible to get the amount of detail planks he had without a little glithing
bro.......... do you even breathe
I found your channel with this video. At this point I've watched nearly half of everything you've posted and all I can think is why have you not hit up Spiff. I feel like you two could do some world ending damage
23:32 wouldn't that combustion not happen? There's no oxygen for the fire too.
i would love for you to play bitlife!
24:53: "im sorry u feel that way door" pure comedy. i have to find places to use this tho it is just an absolute master piece
Does anyone know if you can build the raft around an entire islamd
how did you get this?
I hope josh sees this but a great game he should show case is called technicity prologue.
You should play Minecraft it works on computer because I know you use computers or whatever but it’s OK I’m always very just get to create anything it’s really cool
I wanna know what happens if you save the lady.
This is the only person who can break a nokia phone just by looking at it
"Door is locked from the other side" josh: well I'm sorry you feel that way Door but your about to be opened from thos side. Door: *nervously sweating*. That had me laughing 🤣
ı swear, every human being needs a friend like josh to have fun while playing games
i love how he managed to beat the game without spoiling it
play two point campus!
i fail to accetp that he rly imput the 5963 times
You should play Jurassic world evolution 2
Can you pls do crusader kings 3 again pls
Ahh, the Raft speedrun master! Truly a treasure!
Most powerfull item : stretch board
The best speedrun ever seen 😂😂😂😂
I miss Keanu sad face
While you studied survival tactics, he mastered the art of the Plank.
I’m going to get nightmares by that tornado
Can you play Planet zoo
For planet zoo i will make a mix of all your zoo but good
Josh make more satisfactory pls
Do pikuniku again its been so long
You should play TABS
Can you do Apple Knight next? i found you good in commentary and funny.
Do you remember Anthony
"HEY! A friendly face!" "Let's not go *that* far" 😂😂😂
Play Jurassic world evolution 2
E
this video is gold, just find your channel
The fact they added this is just begging for Josh to mess with the game really funny video!
Found out today, you missed frozen island I think so please make another video. Love your videos
Josh has just helped so many game devs with exploits I mean just look at his beautiful work in this game.
Continue THE SIMS 4...   ?
You should play subnotica
Play subnautica
Josh is the only gaming youtuber who all of us gonna believe if he spend 1month in video to do something (legitly without any creative mode)
i didnt know why,but everytime I'm watching this video i will fall asleep.
Okay, new viewer here, does he use mods or cheats? Or just insane amount of playtime and farming for all that wood.  Also no familiar with the game so not sure how realistic or unrealistic this is
You must play teardown :D
Love to see what you’d do in the game Forager, it’s a little grindy but I’d like to see the chaos that you’d create. Love the videos, keep up the good work!
You deafeningly broke the game
If that game is based of global warming and it said all ice has melted why is there ice in that game like wat
my sister stol my laptop sorry for that comment ......I Love your videos
imagine if he plays astroneer again and blows everything up with dynamite and hydrogen lol
Is this bugs
This guy just destroys every game he touches
Very entertaining‼️
I just hope this man never discovers Warframe
Lol........
Josh, can you make a video on People Playground? I shudder thinking of what your deranged mind will create.
RAFT ❌ DETAILED PLANK ✅
hey josh there is a rails update in astroneer and i think you should check it out and use it totally wrong
so worth the wait of a new vid thanks for the upload
Randomly found your channel while searching for Raft videos and I was instantly hooked. You are f*cking hilarious man, I've been going back and watching your videos and have yet to find one where I did not need to pause the video because I have just started busting up laughing. Please keep up the phenomenal work
RIP lets game it out I can’t believe he died
Don't tell me he really tried over 5k times to open that locker... that man is blessed with patience
U need to play my summer car pleeeeaaaaaas
Josh... I've been watching a lot of your videos lately and I think they're incredibly entertaining.  I've been wondering what your approach to editing is, though.  For the most part it looks like simple cuts but the way your commentary flows so naturally across these cuts is really impressive.  You can have multiple video cuts mid-sentence without disrupting the point.  In some videos I've wondered if you cut/edit the video and then just record commentary over it later, but I have a feeling that's not the case.  I'd really love to know more about your methods!
I'm always laughing every second in video. Thanksssss
This video is very good
Josh is basically just a bug tester
josh is the embodiment of what I want to do in games but don’t feel like doing bc it’s so dumb and laboring
this morning: started my free day with a morningspliff and a random youtubevideo and all of the sudden i fell in love with ur rafttornado, it lightened a spark, subscribed. Good ideas must get rewarded! I love how you expand from raft to cityexplorer, what a talented builder ;D
you should play crossout next, its basically minecraft and mad max combined
Dev: Thats not how you play the game. Am i a joke to you?
MORE JHONY HOTBODY PLS
6:01 where's the teapot
Show me you lazy without showing me your lazy 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Plz play jurassic world evolution 2 I would love for you to make a chaotic park
Cách hát của đức phúc luôn làm hài lòng tất cả mn.
10th most viewed in 10 days
Josh is not a mortal man, he is the physical manifestation of chaos incarnate.
Where is my grace 😂
you can change your youtube account name to Let’s break it out 😂
soon every game will have a bounty board with lgio on it
Who remembers Anthony
I love how josh can make any stackable item into a tornado and then completely destroy the game engine with it
This guy …
He’s finally back with another great video
Yay!
Josh’s brain is just a swirling cacophony of every little dark way to literally break a game and it’s amazing
The raft person is actually an eldrich abomination...
What happened to grace :(
This guy is on a whole another of dedicated.
This a 32 minutes of a giant mess of masterpiece
wow, so cool
I’m so happy Josh has made it to here. I’ve been here since 3 k followers. So happy for you Josh. Really :^)
6:26 this is actually beautiful
Never heard of Raft, don't plan to play, but I did just watch all 32 Minutes. This video made my day.
Bruh I’ve been waiting for this FOREVER
That scripted love bite tho. Let me put all of my belongings right here. *points to the worst place imaginable to build*
do a collab with gray stillplays
I hope the game makers doesn't see this video 😂😂😂😂😂
Lets game it out should do a deep rock galactic video
I have an idea for the next game. Either far cry 5 or far cry new dawn, solely because there is a person named Grace
Ist just …. Just hurt in my eyes
Darn grace she will never learn that the raft isn’t food
Because I've watched Josh too much, every time I wanted to watch people decorate their raft beautifully,  I'll remember how chaotic and fun Josh's is and I'll come back to his video 🤣
I tried going through your videos, and it looks like you don't have anything for Space Engineers? I feel like that's a game you could really get some chaos out of, coming from someone who turned an asteroid intro a doughnut using mining drills.
When I first saw him I immediately new he was going to be my favorite YouTuber
6:03 "it looks like a screensaver from 20 years ago" nice one! It took me a moment to remember 😄
this video is gold
i dont think i could play this game, I have an erational fear of sharks, sometimes at night i think they live in my pool * *shiver down my spine*
This guy is hilarious... Lol
perfect example of fully exploiting a glitch or more like its embodiement
Im sure that board clipping will do wonders for the speed running community.
.... What if the shark eats the entire raft?
This dude HAS to try mindustry. Hes gonna DESTROY THE GAME with his gaga brein, i u question anything u just cant comprehend the geneus of those vids...
The raft developers are just seething at their desks right now.
Just remembered this. What happened to grace
Never played this, first time checking this channel. That was fun!
I want to see you play something Minecraft or Terraria but with fans so you have like 50 people to do your bidding to make all your ideas 50x bigger.
Wow.  I've never heard of this guy or this game before, but that was hilarious to watch.   Thanks video game guy.
Could someone bring the raft dev here, I really want to know they reaction.
Thx again for so much fun;D
Can you please play Minecraft
please play garrys mod
When will you accidentally show us an op gta money glitch
dear merciful josh please spare the game from another world breaking bug
Can anyone imagine what would happen in a coop game between josh and spiffing brit?
LOL I have never heard of this game, never watched any of your YouTube videos, I never will play this game, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching this video. Thanks YouTube algorithm
That was amazing!
freaking hilarious, love your videos :)
Does anybody else wanna see josh play fallout?
you should have detail planked down to that thing at the ocean
Whenever josh says makes sense to me it makes no sense
His use of WeMod is godlike.
Oh no
I love how he just ruins the point of the story giving me more tips then a normal pro tips video
“Ooh look at all that trash I bet it’s nice and soft” *breaks legs*  Meanwhile Dying light: 👀
U made this game like so easy lol
subscribe to DesiredEternity
*makes road of physic-defying boards*
Are you „magic aids“ in disguise? You have the same voice
Can you plz make a video playing scrap mechanic
One day they will have "josh Proof" as a real word, but it is impossible to do.
So you’ve got to be playing Arcade Paradise for us all, yes?
A new hero is born : Plantman
you should look into void train
i dndt know this game was a kind of Subnautica like in term of exploration
Each time i hear Josh say "Is there a limit?" I just close my eyes and pray for his PC.
This guy is like the HowToBasics of gaming
29:35 wizard battle
Is it just me or does Josh actually sound like Rigby from The Regular Show. Just love it 🔥
I can not open ovl files
I miss your planet zoo videos. Since then attempting mods. Maya2023 Blender, etc could you do a video on new nexus mods in pz please useing mods?  Dis raft was funny.
Bro's clipping through walls like Danny Phantom
Explain LEts game it out in one word.
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.   (1 Peter 4:12-13) - Jesus Christ is our only Savior. Repent, The Lord is coming soon.
Hahahaha I laughed way too hard.
You should play turnip boy commits tax evasion, this is a real mobile game
This was so epic
Lol this guy just made a tornado raft Its weird and stupid but its still funny or cool
Please play astroneers new update
I like your videos
Did you give yourself some of the resources because if not you are absolutely insane
imagine developers gathering for a final chapter release party and the main event is watching this vid together
Normal people : This isn't how you're supposed to play this game. Josh: Well, This IS how you're supposed to play a game.
LMFAOSO
okay i cant anymore, my next playthrough im totally going to do the boards thing... i feel like i havent finished the game now.
I see Grace is still there eating Josh's raft. 😆🦈
Hey josh, satisfactory recently got some updates and it involves nuclear :)  Now there a LITERAL NUCLEAR BOMBS/NUKES
Josh what happened to Anthony
This is seriously the best episode of any game he's ever done. I can't stop laughing!
We don’t know a lot about Josh, but what we do know is that he loves to create tornadoes.
pipes screen saver brings back memories
Exellent
Every game developer fears him. No matter how much testing you do. Josh will break your game.
Make more planet coaster videos
lets game it oout should try out ark it would be fun seeing him whit dinosaurs and animals of ark
Somehow everygame ive seen you play youve somehow triggered my ocd im some way and i kinda love it
they litterally give you game keys to find all the  bugs
I love your videos!
You’ve numbed my pain. Thank you.
The variable board is this games version of  Rick's portal gun
What happened to Grace... no not the person (this time) I meant the shark. Did she just tell her cousin to screw with Josh this time?
Q U A L I T Y  i laughed, i learned, i detail planked a snake highway to heaven, youre a genius. Your audience eagerly yet patiently awaits your future exploits!
Josh was the one that grounded his parents
cool
if your new to this channel when you see the time it took him to build something or how many tries it took him to figure something he is noot being sarcastic nor click bait it really did take him how ever long he said it did
i would love to know what the developers of this game would say watching this
Game Designers ( WTF has he done TO OUR BABY ) lol.
The josh man cometh
Hey josh how’s Anthony doing. Have you talked to him recently??
Josh, next time you play this game, please build a submarine since you can build and survive underwater.
Josh is just a bug tester at this rate.
I feel like josh gray and df would be an amazing colab
Is the walk able plank things he is making a mod or in the vanilla game?
*long blank stare* *clicks "Subscribe"*
This video should be called, " let's just keep clipping through things..."
He is the man out there who you will ask him to do something and he will do it 100's of times over.
Others: work hard to find the key josh: plank aliens invade earth
Lets game it out not going to lie you should play subnautica  personally you would ruin the game and it would be really good content.
6:13 Why, I also like to bhop~
Which game?
Josh would be the scariest rust player imaginable
I love you vids
If i own disckord if its april fools i will rename it to d**kskord
The devs apparently weren't counting on someone using detail boards to break questlines and the laws of physics.
you had me at 0,0,0,0 rofl. made my day right there
Yo man ur almost like the YouTuber graystillplays
Castaway meets Gilligan's Island meets Minecraft? Have I got that right? Lol
I am surprised that Josh has not played people playground yet
What happened to you
Why is it that we always come back to tornadoes?
Hey "let's game it out" have you ever played minecraft
MMMMMMMMM
josh broke the whole game by yassifying the ferry of the damned and clipping throught walls
I think we need to name the shark "Grace" ... I miss Grace so much!
Me one more Johnny hot body
welcome back man! where u been?
6:03 EATEOT 5 stage
i wanna know what happend to anthony
good live come laugh who float sail
That mf running away in unfathomable fear of god that hunts him in steady pursuit
And people wonder why no one has faith in EA games, even after they leave EA.
i always suspect he uses wemod because everything he plays is on wemod and has almost hackable resourceses
Do trailmakers
6:02 "Now that it looks like a screensaver from twenty years ago..." Yup, replace the wooden beams with pipes and it's exactly the same!
Indeed 😏🤔💯👊
Hey Josh, can you play rust? I would love to see what you could come up with in that game
guys... i think i know now why he posts monthly. his computer fills so fast with storage now from what hes doing he has to buy a new pc each video because his older pcs are just destroyed 😂😂
I hate his voice
That was the most fun I've ever had watching gameplay😂
You're insane
i like how the other videos on my home page are like "making the perfect base - hydroneer" or something like that, then there'sthis channel
You know he's messing with a game if he's making a tornado
Lame
OMG that’s hilarious! 1 million miles of plank bridges. 🤣🤣🤣
Idea:make poppy playtime in planet zoo
Yo congrats u are trending
You can litterally make any game entertaining   I love people breaking games and it just happens to be your specialty
@10:50 FUN FACT a “?!” Together is called an “Interrobang”.
you should play teardown
hahahah i loved this video, this game couldnt be more scripted than that XD
you should play subnautica and try to break that
Game devs be like -_-
You are my hero 🤘🏻  F* that system
Can you try subnautica
Shark was added specifically to counter Josh's building
You should do a nother visit on astroneer, they added all kinds of automation and fun things to break!
masochism
That ending could not have been more perfect. XD
This is the outside box thinking I like
Hahahaha. omg i really love these vids
you have to play two point campus once
you should try Grounded, it has lots of bugs. literally.
A Info for cooking simulater Hold f for a Suprise
Pls play necromancer story
Play mor e hydronear
This is my brothers nightmare😀😀😀😀
I love chaos
Yep
bruh you straight up broke the game....All the challenges be like am I  a joke
i really love this content
I saw a slow connection symbol in the bottom right… are you in a multiplayer game?? ARE YOU CHEATING??
raft: there is barely any glitches in this game :josh breaks 30 glitches in one video
I love your Videos :3
Josh should play city skylines
Next can you play like a really intense horror game
Seriously, the walking is the worst part -_-
11:28 - The 1 Item mentioned in the title of this half hour video.
The intro is misleading... Is there anyone who doesn't swim for a crate or two every time their HP regens to full?
Ever notice he often names random entities “Grace”?
You make it feel a little Insincere.
The raft at first was actually pretty lol. Like a Christmas tree. 🤣🤣🤣
"ahh your fine" 💀
Hay can you try to mess up Minecraft
How do you even manage to play for so long and not get bored lol
Finaly, Hes Back With Raft, Long Tiem No See This Game!
I feel like the only reason they even let josh and his sanity play this game is because they use him as a bug hunter
Imediately subscribed, The ammount of goofyness and sarcasm. This is going to be a love hate relationship and im looking forward to it
For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.   (Romans 8:29-30) - Repent. The LORD Jesus Christ is coming soon.
I see you took the scenic route. Why not just brute-force all the coordinates?
you give me Conan OBrien vibes dude I love it
Great content haha, have a lovely day if you reading this ❤️
is been almost 3 years since I haven't watched you, please continue your planet zoo series
I have lost my sister. she was only 3 months and she died due to not able to breathe at night. her name is Emma. 🕊
hey Josh? I feel I am one of your biggest fans. can you acknowledge me? I love your videos so much! It would mean alot to me.
Thank you! Great video, altho even better muted
he should play subnatica
The door is locked from the other side Josh: and I took that personally
It took a while for you to resume the game, it’s nice to be back!
23:14
My dad and I watch you and we always die of laughter
Is it just me or is he using word i didnt even know exist
"If its stupid but it works it aint stupid" -Josh, probably
Me what happend to grace ;-;
มันจะมีอะไรมาสู้สะพานสงสัยของ gsspotted ได้
I want to see you play stranded deep
meh
these vids are epic XD love you humour and plank skills !! :D
You had me with the tornado thumbnail 🤣
you are so funny
His cheating without cheating lmaoo
Everytime i watch josh's videos he always give speedrunners move to us
Perfect you hack in a few
I swear, even if Josh grazes a game. It will break havoc to both the dev team and his already on fire PC
"not used to snow flakes" Welcome to 2022, where 60% of the population is snowflakes.
As soon as I knew they could go up in the sky I knew we were in for something
An abomination is ur raft
Outhouse? Just chit and pae in the sea!
Speedruns:
Yes
This raft is an abomination! XD
Josh is becoming a speedrunner
Massive game 🎮
You should try people playground
I just wanted to say that the other day out of pure luck I got I Minecraft pig called grace!
I have played the game throughout, including the final chapter, and this is by far the best tutorial this game has had.
Very nice video!
What a beautiful ending it was <3
Please play Space Engineers I REALLY want to see what kind of ship you could make that still operatrs
Make a second channel called Let's not game it out were you are forced beyond your will to do what the games intend you to do.
12:34 "I don't feel like its odds of surviving hurricane us are very good." That is not a sequence of words I would have expected 🤣
First time to this channel. I thought the title was going to be click bait. . . BUT. . .             This man actually broke he game. O.O
wait why the hell is his voice so high pitched... like did i miss something?
More cooking sim pls
That raft belongs at burning man
Good goos
"give me a few minutes" 9 hours later  a beautiful monstrosity of a raft-tornado I Lost it No doubt why it is the 6 most trending video  11:54
physik left the server ;D
Josh is the only human being to be able to progress the game without actually progressing. I admire his dedication.  Tbh not even sure whether he is actually a human being at this point...
Play rust
Kinda depressed that he didn’t introduce Grace😭😑😪
wow
You should put string lights on the tendrils to make it more night terrifying lol
The developers should be paying Josh - good testers are a precious resource.
He really needs to play subnactia with the flying glitch in it
If this game has taught me anything, it's that we should keep polluting the oceans so that Josh can keep making amazing raft monuments.
GOAT
Josh doesn't use cheat codes, he makes them lol
5964 is my passcode to my phone lmao
24:24 I say and was like wait a minute  omg lol
Every single part of this video made me incredibly happy! 🤣🤣🤣
This has to be some of the finest QA testing I've ever seen. Devs should be paying him for this level of feedback.
I really thought he was gonna edit the griddy when he said dance of celebration
fantastic game, amazing story, well worth the wait
You remind me of graystillplays y’all need to collab
Need a developers react
we missed you Grace
Locked doors are simply no match for Josh's game-breaking skills. He's as unstoppable as a rhino with an iron battering ram.
Gray fell off. Don't take his path.
I have a really really good game Suggestion,it’s called scary teacher 3D
14:12 That's the year where I was born- [ Just borrowed this account. ]
My cousins name is temperance! But we call her Tempy
I feel like i need you to play mindustry cause it will make you lag so hard
Can't believe he forgot the shark's name was Grace!
do you plan these things entirely or just see what happens and work with it?
Try to imagine ralf developer see this  Ralf developers: We better fix this
hi i uh really like your voice it's not in a weird way i just find it oddly calming and it kinda calms me down i think i can't really tell but you're cool as hell dude okay bye
After watching all of your videos I can say that I am very concerned for your mental health
Best Video Ever. I’m glad it was my intro to your Channel . Instant sub
this video was pure gold, you sir have earned yourself a subscriber.
Your videos always give me a good laugh. Your commentary is solid brother.
Oh boy.
Now I know the idiom “where there are doors, there are… detail planks” comes from
24:56 why was this so hot
Epic as always! Almost as good as satisfactory
josh finds the weirdest but absolute best ways to break games
When I see you post I know it’s gonna be a good day
"I felt like this is another level of lazyness"
Ok I want Josh to make a video where he plays a game completely normally, until at the very end he reveals he also was breaking the game in such fun ways, and it’s released on April 1st
Me: Clicks on Video Expecting to Only Watch 2 Seconds  Also Me After Finishing the Video: Take my TIME
Anomaly 756 aka the Board Fever 756-1 is a humanoid named Josh who bends reality of time and space by placing customizable boards 756-2 that can go through solid objects and makes any living mortal who touches them able to breathe in space and underwater it can also force people to be smushed on solid objects but if this happens to 756-1 they will be able to go through anything.  Keter class  Currently contained in a game
Hi Josh, your therapist here. You aren’t answering my calls?
We do honestly need a face cam for one of these to get an idea of YOUR reaction to thus. Bc I can't breathe nor see due to the crying and suffocation caused by laughter.
6:31 it really does look cool
They give josh access to beta test because he is always trying destroy games
MineCraft variant.
Imagine how much wood it costed for those boards lol
"9 hours later".. He was serious about it taking 9 hours lol.
Essentially you are Dangerouslyfunny but with a deep voice
The guy just glitched his was to the end of the game, Im dying
Your videos always bring a smile on my face it’s too funny!🤣😂
I love this. I am currently rather sick, and any action involving my throat hurts a bit. I had to clutch my face several times to stop my convulsing face muscles from laughing. As that would hurt. Good video!
I feel Josh can beat LPL in opening a door.
Josh is like Mr.Beast doesn't upload often, but it's max quality content
Hey josh! If you didn’t know, they released goat simulator three now and I just wanted to let you know so that you make a video on it😁
this was the most pointless game i ever tested :S
Josh is the boss fight for game developers
I like this happy end where ones again is a nightmare unfolding.
Game developers fear this one man
play drug dealer simulator i see too much potential for content in the game for you
"I'm bored-" "don't you mean BOARD?"
I'm still floored by how he thinks of these things in every video lol
neat idea for a video but you usually don't spoil the entire game, I had to stop watching halfway through because I'd actually like to play it sometime
do you know gray still plays
MORE SATISFATORY PLZ
MORE SATISFATORY PLZ
So when Satisfactory
The iron cross raft
How much time do u have
Bro just casually beat the entirety of raft
*falls 10000 feet* Josh: eh, you're fine!
He is not breaking the 4th wall, just breaking through the 4th plank
Laughing so hard I have to pause.  Really good walkthrough of a game  🤣😂  love your raftnado
I didn't know I needed a whole channel based on the phrase "how wrong can I play a game"  I've binged several videos and I can confidently say I'm not leaving  May I suggest Spore? It's an old game but the creature, veichle and building creators have a lot of potential for horrors
Josh on plank = John Cena "you can't see me 👋"
He could definitely get up to some stuff in Grounded
Holy crap you have 4 mill?? Last time I checked you had 2 mill
Developers hate him
Everyone look out for Hurricane Us!
Well that's definitely getting patched.
We spent more than 3 years developing this! How dare you! 🥺 -Raft Dev. Team
That was great
@Socksfor1
First video I watched of this guy but dude his patience is actually next level, brute forcing a 4 digit code? Building for hours upon hours? Dude is insane
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.                        nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooo
eeeeeeeee.      ee.
Please play Mindustry with mods (it's free)
Awesomeee commentary🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude is playing Mortal Engines, and he is London
Honestly, he needs a 2nd channel where it’s the reaction videos of the developers to his videos.
10:30 ark meshers be like:
wait 14:25 2011 is the same year i was born 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
grace just doesn't leave you alone
They've added so much to this game
ROFL all the way... What a find! 👍👍👍👍
Josh is gray but calmer
Have you ever thought about starting a podcast? You have a pleasant voice.
Josh is the guy who’s videos we would watch while we eat
He's funny but the game itself seems so boring
I feel like developers just give early access to josh just to point out bugs they missed
"If I can't use it or knock it over, what's the point?"  Josh is the literal definition of a cat
this is amazing
amazing to see your frame rate managed to stay intact this time!
This is hillarious ,you made the game to the next level hahahah
man will he ever run out of boards
You should really play Conan exiles. I feel like you would have an entire kingdom built in your first day or so.
This guy just violently radiates chaotic neutral energy

It looks like the Torus from that classic movie "Epoch". lol
This was a great ending to the Hydroneer Series.
"You're fine"🤣
Random guy who is apparently evil and was cloned: "My army will crush you!" Josh: *my army of planks will crush you*
6:10 he remade the game altf4
your so funny
Why didn't i found out this channel earlier.... What a additive crazy content... Totally loved it 🔥🔥🔥
I wonder if Josh is like this in real life too. Imagine him at Costco getting free samples then asking "is there a limit? Let's find out!"
feel that way
Jsjsj
Man my anxiety is driving me up the wall with how your building stuff 🫠
omg change your voice plz
amazing vid!!! the raft-nado was dope
E
The longest short I have ever watched
Love how Josh can make a game just shader lol
Get him to 1b views total he's at 960m
🤣😂😅
Do i watch an episode of Monthy Phyton here ? ...feels like it, can´t stop watching, great video.
I used to say you can’t go insane if you already are but josh taught me otherwise
The string lights were actually really beautiful. lol
finished my meal watching 30mins of the entire gameplay, what a beauty
Feeling bad for those developers of the game 🤣🤣
"Come float sail" literally changed my life
Here’s a ultra hard challenge. Play. A. Game. How. It. Is. Supposed. To. Be. Played. Yes he won’t complete it!
Check out drug dealer simulator
“I am the chaos guardian, guardian of the mayhem” “His PC quivers before him”
29:07 your laugh was so contagious
You know he’s up to no good when he says he’s playing raft
Josh: I didn't realize I was dealing with a wizard!!! Also Josh: 30:25
Josh: How many tornadoes can I get into steam landing pages? Only one way to find out....
Omg when he said it looks like a screen saver from 20 years ago!  Watching those pipes form was so satisfying.
lmao
If you listen to this in the mindset that it's Troy McClure everything makes a lot more sense.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
You should play “teardown”🙂
Can you play pikuniku again plz
Bruuuhhh the views is almost like the views of the video a year ago 😂
That was a beautiful journey!
Genius
At this point why does he even use the paddle to go to new locations when he can use walk ways
God I wonder what the devs think when they see Josh post a video. I assume they love it ❤️
i lasted 30secs listening to your whiny voice
Just perfect , i salute you
Please please please please please please please please
Can you do more planet crafter
When that mean lady got launched underwater why didn’t you go underwater to see what happened with your glitch
Josh will be respectfully banned from playing any game
Your guy hasn’t gotten any sleep in a year with 40 different breaks in his legs
Here’s what happens if you don’t believe in material science, gravity, fall damage, oxygen or even physics.
Josh is the god of exploits
the amount of time does this guy have, is incredible.
Play battle cats you'll like it.😆😆😆
You realize you could just take the 8/9 first minutes of the video and make it the best Raft beginner guide i've seen on youtube ? Mad man
The grRaaaaaaannnddddd touuurrr
Please please PLEASE play Jurassic world evolution! It’s got everything…      Including Carnivores!
YESSIR Username:Dequan_gold
4:10 motivational quote!😭
Why didn't you use the boards to get to the bottom of the ocean? :D
Oh finnaly, this is a LGIO Video i'm here for. Love it! ❤‍🔥
HAHA!
You went full eldritch horror on this game. Imagine you're stranded on an island praying for a miracle and off in the distance you see the approaching abomination that is your raft. Horrifying.
Just me or is he like a cross between postal guy and Grey still plays?
favorite moment......9,000 hours later.... Hurricane US!!! AND IT SPINS!!!
This is grate content
How’d he find the will power to try all those combinations? It’s pure masochism.
josh dropped!
Best Josh ever
You sound like Grey
24:17 he is lucky it was bricks and not legos
Backroooms
This man just made raft into fortnite
sharks love bites...... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thanks
Lets game it out and gray still plays = even more chaos
He just destroyed reputation of raft creators in 1 sec
wow josh you are so lazy. but indeed, why use your legs when you have alternate ways to get to places?
He keeps making me laugh
So did you justa turn off the shark to do all this?
Josh: I didn't realise we were dealing with a wizard-  Also Josh: *makes a tornado out of boards, shoves himself into walls using boards and defies physics*
Lil Timmy: Dad can we have Graystillplay's? Dad: Yea! We have Graystillplay's at home!  *graystillplays at home*
Does anyone else who watched REALLY enjoy the way this man says the word "antenna".
🍷🍾 hey guys today you cool 😎🌹🌹🌷 and subscribe my I’d bro than also send like aur subscribe
Yeah the plank thingy wasn't a broken item we should keep it👌👍
you have the patience of a zen monk
It's an Absolute heartbreak Josh Literally forgot about Grace AKA The Shark.
i miss lets play it out dis hes last video pls come back lets play it out
For some reason any game this guys plays he does thing in the most dumb and inefficient ways but it SOMEHOW WORKS ALL THE TIME
Josh can use the most simple item and break it to point where the developers would remove it
so... that's what they had in made when they said "covenant of artorias will help you trough the abyss" Neat.
hey can you make a new simp video??
recomendation for games  play minecraft
Now that I have broken it.  Wanna see me do it again?  -Josh probably
What about the snow mobile
Other people: doing the old fashion way  Josh: planks
play more rise of ages
Once again it is proven that tornado is the most beautiful shape. I’m so curious over how many days this recording took. Would he play a lot one day, not for a few, and then do more progress again the next? Also, Masterful BruteForce King, how did you know about the importance of the detail planks 👀
You'd be a very good beta tester.
Thank you i love your jokes.
I’ll pray for you <33 Jesus loves u God bless
He always goes for the tornadoes… Loved the raftmastree though!
Bro i cant stop laughing XD
clipping that bed thru the window was truly spectacular
raft is mr beast simulator  colect trash from the ocean
I'm assuming this is done in creative mode? The detail plank is pretty dang expensive
Hi
Please make a raft Playlist so I can Bing your other play throughs
as nightmarish as the screensaver raft was, at night with the lights, it was quite pretty.
You're my hero
Hey josh pls play minecraft
Give ma a few minutes "9 hours later*   (If u really want to Break the game only have 1 raft piece)
I love when Josh takes ONE item or feature and uses that to absolutely break the game.
This one has a lot of patience...
The year is 2072. Society has collapsed and I have been forced to survive alone for the last 4 years. I managed to find a stable rhythm to this living hell in this island I call home. I’m gonna get some rest after a long day of supply gathering… but looks like a storm is approaching in the distance. Hopefully it passes over easy…  “Hey guys it’s josh let’s game it out”  What is this god like being defying every kind of physics I ever learned. I need to lock myself in my safe room, I can’t afford to die here.  “A locked room? I don’t think so”  A thrilling chill goes down my spine as I see this god sprite drop in my room. This is it isn’t it… I’m just going to sit on this chair and wait for my slow death.  “Ah here it is…”  What… he took my notebook… what is this? He’s leaving… and so is the storm…   this is stupid
Make more videos damnit!
I was expecting the title to be exaggerated.  Nope. Entire game completely broken with one item. Exactly what was promised. Good show.
I love you
This is the greatest glitch I've ever seen. Beautiful content
Josh you are da BEST!
YOU FINALLY MADE A VIDEO ABOUT RAFT
Cool!
WHERE’S GRACE
Ngakak
I can’t😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Play BTD6 (day6)
I bet the developers of raft is going to add let's game it out wanted sign too
The constant monotone sarcasm... hilarious.
This guy can easily break reality.
Im honestly not even surprised you did that.
You should do a collab with Dangerously Funny
Josh be like: let's ruin this because I'm funny
the odd thing is, i'm not sure josh even Needed the detail plank to break the game this badly? we even see him doing roughly the same thing with normal building pieces at 9:43. it's just a lot funnier that he only needed one singular item to do all this
@6:03 can confirm was using a computer 20 years ago
4:15 wtf
this is just stranded deep with less steps
Hope the next video continues the lore of cooking sim that josh made for some reason
Play Changed, break the latex furry game please pls pls pls pls
I swear the PTSD that tornado made me feel should not be legal
I just love all your raft videos, I laugh so hard
Play cities vr! I don’t know much about it but I bet you can break it
The shark? Her name is Grace!
When a wooden plank works as every single key in the game Well minus the crane key but who cares about that
Is this modded or am I dumb
Imagine walking
Could say you were board of doing things the conventional way
Well I’d say you single handedly broke the YouTube algorithm as well😂😂 one week and almost 10 million views holy cow 😳😳 for a video like this I’d say that’s a high number !!!
This is so funny.
I wana pet all the yeens
Game devs should add a let's game it out mode that allows Josh to fulfill his deepest fantasies in the games he play
Next Version of this game would be called  Broken Raft
What the hell is this shark talk, it's Grace get it together Josh :)
WHY HAVNT YOU BROKEN 7 DAYS TO DIE YET!?
I'm impressed that you could add that many boards extending the raft that far out and the game didn't crash or lag out
Play Subnautica
Trade coin is bitcoin
Josh you NEED to play 'totally reliable delivery service' and make a vid of it
6:30 I know it’s meant to be a joke but that actually looks really cool
Laws of Physics?  Where we're going we don't need the laws of physics
Could have used some testers
lol most broken game ever!
Make a video on factorio it’s really fun and is just like Skyrim in the fact that it’s a perfectly balanced game with no exploits
raft has updated again
A true speed run
We need a jonny hotbody pls
And he’s climbing the detail plank to heaven…
Lmfao,  this video is insane
queue chickenonaraft
Loved it. Great work. Love you man.  I love how he legit finished the game with less than 10% effort and with a decorative item.  Climbs over the tallest mountains. Clips though doors and wall with roof and makes underwater part obsolete.
i’m so happy i found this creator he gets funnier every single time
I like how Josh basically invents new speedrunning tactics
ROOOOOFL🤣🤣
And also do you use a voice changer
best youtuber in the world so funny and good quality vids i wish there were more people like you
We were watching this... my mom says she wants a detail plank for Christmas.
A nerfing coming to you in 3..2..1
The dude srsly used The Backroom's Ability to noclip
Laugh my socks off more death tournament every human and then trap them for forever in jail never leaving and make ‘em look at dead bodies from animals
I’m German soo happy someone crazy like me u amarican hochastabler love other Germans
this is the best thing ive ever seen
Oh god satisfactory made its way in this game somehow
9:45
10:20
So many videos have a good concept but insufferable commentary.
LMFAOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭
I srsly love your videos , they helped me trough a rough patch an trough depression , you rock mate!!
JOSH PLEASE PLAY JURRASIC WORLD EVOLUTIONS!!!
29:07 i think we herry pot-tar
La casa de vegetta
can we talk about how nice the string lights tree raft lookdd
Why is the shark no longer named Grace??
josh is the greatest gamer of all time
Hahaha you are honestly the most entertaining game youtubers.  "How can we break this game today?"
This episode was fabulous

You are one of the best creators on YouTube
Love you Josh.  Missing Anthony…
Shark = let’s game it out say ouchy
30:39 I like to think the bad guy was terrified because of Josh bending space and reality through planks
Next game too torture people in, Two Point Campus
Hey man, It works great and without any problems.
Raft creator:finaly we finished the game without any bugs Josh:Are you sure about that
dude created a new speedrun tactic
You ar the best tester for devs 🤣
Well, you probably just broke the game back to alpha, good job!
Please make another video and find the snow mobile at that North Pole island and you can collect the rhino shark
WHY DID THE STRING LIGHTS MAKE THAT LOOK SO GOOD
Raft Devs: Ha, finally made our game Josh-proof! Josh: You missed a board muahahaha!
oh boy 30 minutes this is gonna be fun
mom i want graystillplays we have graystillplays at home graystillplays at home:
Sounds like a graystillplays title
you sound like emkay if they did a gaming channel
This man's dedication to his insanely difficult and amazing videos is beyond human. I wish I could be more like him.
This guy should get a job as a game tester
Please play idle streamer u will like it😉
feels good watching a man experience perpetual torture while eating chicken nuggets   Edit: i have no more nuggets but it’s still nice
“ josh is like a computer virus when he plays a game”: first he enters the game innocently, then he proceeds to find the games weak point. He multiplies the weak point and uses it agains the game until it’s completely ruined.
this video sucks
19:01
best video ever
How hurricane Irma was created
Amazingly broken, thank you
Without a doubt, no matter what my day looks like, your videos make it great! Thank you!!!
14:07 i didnt know what he meant by broke the game with an item but man ive been laughing for the last full minute this is awesome ahahah
Josh has the grindset of a speedrunner, and uses this skill to break games not for speed- but for entertainment-purposes. Glory upon ye!
16:38 Standing here... i realize xD
Also Drive whichever one gets the most whichever one gets the most likes you should play first
Also Josh here's another game and it's called Happy's humble Burger Farm and it's a horror cooking game
This dude has to meet @GrayStillPlays
20:10:06
You should play Jurassic world evolution
Game it out on Two Point Campus!!
I can't believe that not only did I manage to watch an entire half hour video in one sitting, I did it without being distracted by anything else once..
Grace meme is dead…
Josh, i want you to know that you can make any game entertaining EVEN if you dont even play it right. Im so glad i found your channel
this is by far the most enjoyable content on youtube xD love it every time
You definitely got Squidward energy 😂
I really enjoyed it, I can't stop laughing. I love when games are broken in a fun way!
Me: Seeing Josh has spend the last 9 hours building a raft-nado.  facepalm myself. What have i expected... 😅
Your fine
Im sure you get comments like this alot but how do you not have a spore video on htis channel? Seems perfect for you
It ha s been forever since I've watched your videos! Im starting to watch the zoo planet videos again
When you crack the reality so much.. that different versions of people starts to come out..  Another theory..  You go back in time and collect 50 of yourself and attack one guy..  The remainded me that each of your past self have to do the same thing 50 more time each..
Whenever you hear Josh say; “Let me give you the grand tour.” You know you’re about to see nightmares beyond comprehension.
You should play little big planet
Hey you wanna join the club you seem a little fit for the club d&d at 12:13pm
Nah, I’m just going to ignore the laws of physics😂
this bug will give you the pacifist route lol
This is so hilarious, and for the first time, not a click bite image!!! You actually built it unlike some other YouTube channels just putting some random fake thing and claim they’ve done that in their titles.  Great job!
=)

No one’s gonna talk about on how he put in all those codes and not insane yet
We only lost 32 minutes - he is lost in life!
you somehow turnd raft into a assassins creed climbing mini game
This reminds me of that one spongebob episode where they rebuilt spongebobs house.
No stariway to haven - but there is a variable length plank!
I'm six days late... shame shame
Honestly it's good that you skipped that irradiated hyena boss because that's actually very hard to do. However if I was in your position I would probably cheat the boss. Make him summon it and play the teasing game by shooting arrows into it from your walkway of hope and cheese.
How did you have enough materials to build this much
Oh there is a bunch of new things just from the last time I played....ummm. hummm
Someone stop this mad man.
The most overpowered item ever created much much more greater than the infinity stone.... "The Detailed Plank"
You are the god of the detail plank, you literally made it your pet and traveled the world with it lol
ولدت عام 2011 ...
you need to post more videos please
Raft: You need _____  This dude: Sorry you feel that way game
did the makers of raft wrong you in some way? because it feels like that
Josh should be paid by speedrunners for all the stuff he discovers.
hey Josh you should play "The Cult of the Lamb" it's a super fun game with a ton of glitches
10/10, perfect video, maximum chaotic energy
i have no idea how you can do this kind of stuff lieke in the mining game you make massive construction and fish for hours its insane
No giant creature was harmed during the making of this video.
how much planks were used in this video?
Bruh just bruh why
Amazing
Finally someone that actually played the game right🌝💅👹
This game looks legitimately boring.
Every video is like a train wreck and I can't look away or stop
if raft ever makes large servers for random people to join and josh joins one they are all doomed
I know Josh probably won't see this but I think a minecraft series would be great because you can break the game in so many ways
Why learn in school when you can just learn stuff by clicking a button in this game
I will develop a small game where you have to be josh and play videogames the wrong way. The more you do things the wrong way the more points you get, and a small bonus if you play the wrong way wrong
i love how half way through it turns into a the floor is lava challange
All I can think about seeing this is that one SpongeBob episode
Congratz on trending
you think this was bad, just wait till he finds a non ueclidean game
I love watching let’s game it out because I can watch people waste days of their life for a 30 minute video so I don’t have to😂
The amount of work you do to Brute Force into things make sure video is not only amazing but you do it in a hilarious manner
He sounds like a white Cleveland in a ripoff family guy
Awesome 🤣🤣🤣
Me talking about my therapist and girlfriend: 17:21
I feel like watching technoblade playing raft
I miss the good old days when that shark was named grace. BRING BACK GRACE!
3:43 that's not possible that u got so many deco boxes witch takes hours to get and still doesnt have spear, there were some cheats used
Whenever he up loads it always puts a smile on my face thanx josh a lot ☺️
I feel like this wasn’t how the game intended you to play it
10:11 I guess you could say you’ve got a sleeper agent
He could get so much money for reporting bugs in some games…
That was entertaining lol subscribed :)
The string lights actually made it look good at night 😂 nice little detail frfr
Him and graystillplays is what gets me through my day
I'm so torn. on one hand, it's very cool and impressive how he exploits game mechanics to their limits in creative ways in his videos. but on the other hand, I find his voice and attitude so insufferable that it makes the videos hard to watch :/
he breaks this game more and more each time in more horrible ways
I can already hear the devs crying
the speedrun in this game must be so involved...
It’s funny that you can break all game that you play
I can only imagine how the devs feel while watching Josh do this xD
29:00 i loved that laugh hahahah
Idk if this man is a Dev's worst nightmare or their greatest best friend
I can't imagine how long this video took to record
Love the sudden cut to a fully built shrine at 4:21
This video is like reading a book where the text is missing punctuation.
Bro just got 9.5 mil views
Lol
This is the best Raft gameplay ever. Just purchased this game to play it this way. If they fix this I'll refund it
While you studied survival tactics, he mastered the art of the Plank.
greatest video ever
eyyy #40 on trending for gaming
You should really play People Playground and make some lovely chaos there!
Game developers : what is he doing? Gamers: he is beginning to believe.
now that's broken
:o
Game Developers must love you ahahahhaha
24:17  ah you are fine 😂
You should play cult of the lamb it is pure chaos
😃
just a question did this guy ever took a game seriously
Shop at kleaner kicks
I want him to play the metro franchise so badly
7:11 it’s actually an oil rig
This guy reminds me of the spiderman 3 game tutorial narrator 😂😂😂
why you so funny i’m 16 and your just the most halarious person i’ve ever met hahahha
I don't even play the game nor planning to do so, but I watched every second of it.
this guy usually uploads like once or twice a month and everytime his videos are so funny  he has single handedly found a way to break everygame he plays lol
The tenacity
Game devs: Finally we’ve patched everything so that LGIO cant glitch the game!  LGIO:
You should show one for your friends your crazy ways
Why u sound like a clanka?
He's gooood
This guy likes doing tornados...
he can just play and break the game within 10 minutes
Speed running raft
Man who leaves a giant empty high tech ship for just a floating Raft ?
Best youtuber ever
I’m about to watch, and from the thumbnail, I’m already scared.
I aspire to break games like this💖
Please tell me how he has this much wood? Bruh 🤣🤣🤣
yay the funs!!!!!!!!
ah, you used mods to cheat the game in order to make video. shold have known
Oh, and a white man is a villain again. This is becoming a tired trope, and I'm a Filipino.
The real game design issue is the clipping, not the detail plank.
13:54 Knock yourself out with a detail plank
I love how everything you touch turn into eldritch tentacle abomination
Josh just tried to speed run raft
This guy matches my humor
Yeah, I need to watch this again.
I just realized that Let’s Game it Out and the lockpicking Lawyer are basically the same man in very different fields and that great
Obnoxious POS.
Josh, if you aren't already, become a bug tester. Preferably for GTA5+6
He Give the game  developer nightmare
This is what got me interrested in the channel, keep it up
u should be a official bug tester
You should Also try to break scrap mechanic
CallMeKevin's ramp doesn't seem so crazy now.
"Break on thru to the other side!"
I should've learned this sooner, Would've been Hilarious :D
This man is dangerously intelligent. But we are lucky he is spending it on entertainment vs being the next legendary bank robber.
This is one of the best game videos I've ever seen.
Someone stop this man
His speedrunning raft
24:48 the way he says "hello?" just kills me LOL.
I missed your videos, man!  Glad to see more chaos again!  ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Satisfactory
Only a man named Josh could think of something this Smart.
It’s the last chapter update? Not anymore after Josh’s video gets seen by developers lmao
Soooooooo, you're frozone but with wood. Hmmmmmm I see, I see
You know when josh say 7 hours later we all believe it
Kinda childish commentary with the ouchie and aah stuff but for the rest was a lot of fun to watch
Мне понравилось как ты рассказываешь, хоть я ничего и не понял.  10 ящиков из 10 👍
(not) grace the shark
That was awesome
All those planks and the game still runs stable?! Im impressed 😱 Now I know what I need to do the next time I play Raft 😜
Just realised this channel is just the video game version of howtobasic
Yaaaa youre back please upload video quickly it's too late
"I didn't realise we were dealing with a wizard!" ....I mean.... Takes one to know one?
with 4 million subs i still think the guy is under rated
I am 100% certain that game devs should hire hime to play test their games
just beca a subscriber keep up the good work Sir.
I played this game when the most elaborate things you could build were higher platforms, stairs, and a dining table and chairs. That was the end game at the time. When youd done that and supplies stopped spawning in, youd pretty much won. Glad to see this game is now fully hilarious
At 10mil you should do a face reveal
I guess you unlock a super secret ending. Hahaha
BWAHAHAHAHA I had NO idea they put something so broken into the game! Decorative plank should only be placeable on like foundations and walls etc, not on itself! Bwahaha!
I like how you sound like a combination of Cleveland and that creepy old man... (Both from family guy)
скучное видео
Lol iblove not having to have played much of this game just to enjoy this so much more.
🤣😂🤣😂
Lol the string lights on the beams actually look nice
6:00 far cry 3 radio tower parkour
The amount of "thumbs up" in this video is the same amount of "likes"
Hi
You should play factorio for a video
one question: WHERE IS GRACE
you should do surviving mars, another paradox game.
Guy kinda sounds like Cleveland brown
can u make a video about "dinkum" on steam ^^ i love ur v
i fear nothing  but those tendrils… they scare me
Ok.
@Lets Game It out I swiped as soon as you did this edit , which btw good job editor 👏 @00:21 well played good sir🔎
Satisfactory gameplay?
ive never watched one of this dudes videos before. went in like, how does this guy have 4.5 mil subs? after finishing the vid, that was probably one of the most entertaining yt vids ive seen in awhile 🤣🤣
This guy literaly just speedrun with glicth
Find game  Find item  Exploit item  Win game  Repeat
WHY!
almost everyone when there character gets hurt: heals up with an apple or something   nobody: josh when his character gets hurt: your fineeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee   now and then when he falls i say your fineeeee   HAHAHAHAHAHHHHAHAAHAH
This guy deserves every single view and sub on his channel. I wonder how much time he spend doing all this. XD
Girl's dreams: OMG I KISSED MY CRUSH!!1!1 boy's dreams: 24:29
Coffee involved?
I love how casual he is about every move he makes like he has done this a million times
Remember having fun isn't hard if you have a library card
if they mess with the decoration plank cause you i will be upset.. :( cool vid tho
Why did he have to loan like that when that bigger shark hits him at 23:55
how is your pc not exploding repeatedly non stop?
Technically you need tons of woodplanks for that especially with the bear island thing and the caravan town (since they're tall and very wide), and to do so you need to spend a lot of time farming or searching for woods, which might be even simpler or faster doing the quest the normal way. And whenever you finish with the plank, you gotta destroy it and perhaps some of them are not refunded.
Man.  You're like Iceman, except... with planks of wood.
Wow this guy just exploint the intire game without even get squba gear
My man's speedbridging in Raft like Minecraft Bedrock
gas gas gas
You are the best bastard on YouTube
that's crazy xD
Josh skipped whole boss fight💀, holy moly. God at finding glitches. Bet devs are shocked lmao
Hi let’s game it out play game called Power wash simulator pls
They weren't trying to spell hell they were trying to spell help and I just saw that part to I don't need to see the rest I know you'll make a monstosity
Imagine being a dev pouring thousands of man hours into your game only to have Josh completely trivialize the whole thing with the use of a single item.
what a plot twist ending 🤣
30sex and the voice made me crazy. I get why this guy spends his days playing video games
devs internal screams*
“Just a few”  *oh great heavens, what have you done*
I should be asleep 🙃👍
Let's game it out : ill just take a shortcut
The tornado looks like that......Thing.......You built in satisfactory
Why does it look like this is how the game is supposed to be played 🤣
The shark name is Grace 😉
"A game that you lets you place... is a game that Josh can break." *_Sun Tzu - The Art of War_*
hell yeah!
Tip for Brute Forcing: if the codes aren't randomized, and they weren't, then search up a list of four digit codes sorted most used to least used.  1337 and 8008 are a lot more common than 0001.
Hotfix - Raft 1.09  Detail Plank has been removed
00:48 my biggest fear...
ah yes, the SS Tornado
Literally every minecraft player when they have an absurd amount of dirt/netherrack blocks.
Mastercraft
Omg! congrats on 4 million! you probably don’t know who I am but I haven’t seen you since probably around a few 100k! damn I wish I didn’t lose that password to my old account
12:03 was the last thing I ever expected in anything out of all my expectations during my entire existence
Chaotic Neutral: The Movie
Your ability to 100% dedicate yourself to a bit is genuinely admirable.. I mean 99% it's entirely pointless but the fact that you can do it is pretty awesome
hahahahahaha!   Funny guy!    Thanks for the laughs man.😆
Just remember: Shogo will be trapped in that tube indefinitely
I love this video
Josh can make fun of any game’s bugs and by the next video on it it’ll be patched.
You should try to take the boards to the bottom of the ocean and see how deep it goes.
So far this is the longest video with many views I've seen 😂
i can feel the pain
God of bugs 😂👍
I absolutely love how his creativity energy is used to spite any game creator
Grace, we need grace
i laugh so hard seeing the board at 13:30. this dude is crazy LMAO
Unironically speed running raft **chefs kiss**
I now know the entire story of Raft without playing even a minute, but I wouldn't have it any other way. God bless Josh for doing anything other than God's work.
Should have put lights along all the tendrils
First video I've seen of yours and I'm not disappointed. This was amazing 👏🏻
“Oh, I didn’t know we were dealing with a wizard.” Pot, meet kettle.
20:04 I thought my phone was cracked on the top right corner. My heart!
absolutely humiliating to think i played this the wrong way
It’s horrifyingly horrific but yea
My claustrophobia could never
I need to know how many planks he had to collect for this
Speed run?
His voice gets kinda annoying after some time ngl
Lol
breaking games one board at a time
I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD THE FREAKING RAFT
This earned a sub this guy is genuinely funny
Josh though "lmao so weird and stupid"              Bro made art at 6:31
frenetic editing keeping every voice track pretty close to the other.. this type of format usually gets lots of views and it tells A LOT about our need of constant triggers. and the need of constant triggers can explain a A LOT about this whole generation
Nothing like setting your raft to wireframe mode.
Comment
The tornando 🤣🤣😂🤣
why?
Litraly haven't watched you in ages but as soon as I heard youer voice/you style I remeber imedatly
26:23 mood
It's official, Raft is now a physics defying nightmare.
Epic
Follow the 10 commandments Christians and ask for forgiveness so you go to heaven and repent from your sins
I swear, josh has to be insane. but the good kind of insane, the kind that is so extremely entertaining. never change josh. never change. continue making both the games you play and your own pc beg for mercy
Josh should be every QA department's white whale 😂
The amount of time that Josh takes to entertain us
how is your computer not dieing???
Oooh man... that board bridge just bobbing like that was eerie***
Bravo to the devs of this game. I would have expected the FPS to absolutely TANK from this.
You know what would be good? A video reaction to this video from developers
Cheat includes: Detail Plank
Definetly out of this world haha
how does this almost have 10 million views
Does it take skill to break a game months after it's final relaese? idk, but it gets a lot of views apparently
Seeing that screensaver bob like that was eirie
This whole video is the essence of " he a little confused, but he got spirit"
🎵 THATS WHY I LIIIIIIIKE, NESTLÉ CRUNCH!!! *insert this guy's legs breaking sound effect*
why is it every time I get a notification of an upload I wait to watch, I regret doing so every time, you always break things the best of ways.
Ohhhhh I loooove decorating my package
This is absolutely perfect "4AM" fuel.
my Asian parents when i tell them about my mental health:   Ahh, you're finee
Lmfao completely broke the entire game
This narrator might be the definition of mundane
I use to wonder why Josh had so much time in-between videos I see why now🤣🤣🤣
I hope Josh does more Satisfactory, it was hilarious
6:31 An actual beautiful  site
Didn’t you name the shark last time?
Now I want a do this
Genius.
Haven’t seen grace in a while, wonder what shes up to?
It always ends up as a tornado no matter the game lmfao
Im the snake you can truuust
this man has to much time on his hands
channeling the satisfactory tornado conveyer belt on raft LOL
I only call the shark Grace. It's entirely cannon
Love Josh but hate the game  Nuclear fusion ≠ radiation rods for power.   Nuclear Fusion is grasping the plasma from radiation and creating high speeds for energy. By having the molecular atoms bounce off of each other to create energy.  If some a thing were to malfunction and open up. The special type of radiation would be instantly diluted by our atmosphere.   Two types of radiation  The one from uranium and the one from the sun.  The more you know
aBout halfway though, I'm currently wondering why i decided to watch this while on lsd because i have no idea whats goin on at this point LOL
Josh looks at how to play games and says naaah
Is everyone POC in this game?
Everyone in Utopia swam after seeing Hurricane Oblivion
This would be a hell of a survival story in real life…. Man builds circuit boards on massive floating island he built from trash.
You should’ve went underwater to see if she was okay
THE DECORATION PLANK or whatever its called IS SO OP so when i get this game I WILL BE LOOKING FOR AS MANY CHESTS AND PLANKS AS POSSIBLE.
He called his brothers from parallel universe lmao
Best walk through I have ever seen in raft! No more stupid puzzle! Detail plank is the answer!
U should play “FANCADE”
FINALLY A RAFT. IDEO
this was absolutely hilarious XD
You two have alot in common
Do a collaboration with graystillplays
This is gold, preserve it.
Josh has the knowledge to think of the unthinkable.
I feel like the speedrun of this game might have been slightly effected by this video release
Good thing nobody bothers to QC check these games before putting then out. 😅
He says he’s not walking but moving across a unstable line of planks is still walking
.. wow..
3D pipes was my favorite screensaver
There was something very eldritch about that raft.
Josh: "We're playing some more Raft today" Raft's developers: *violently shaking in fear*
lmao he broke the game
woow good
Within 6 days!
raft sucks for a couple reasons.
Josh saying let me break it down, has a double meaning lmao
Ahh if only we had a variable length plank for all the games.
My laptop would have melted halfway through with all those boards.
Falcon from Gameranx?
I love the immense capability if his consistency in breaking games religiously
this was great! good job!, i just join and wanted to say i would love to see you play RUST
Game developers should hire him to try to break their games so they can fix them before release.
What's the game?
I really enjoyed  this  video of yours. Good job. The Spiffing Brit  is probably proud of you. O7
My guy turned raft into fortnite building
Josh goofing around with the game mechanics until he glitches to success is masterlass! XD
When you hear josh say give me a minute you know that he made something crazy that really took 5 hours or more
Never seen or watched your content. Youtube referred this video and I couldn't be happier. Bro this was downright hilarious
Can you play an game good and lawfully perfectly ? Like follow the rules and stuff but make it like professionally good
Vasagatan is swediah
Love how he just broke all the gameplay with the raft
that mans legs must be non-existent after josh threw himself off so many entrances
This video randomly popped up this morning. Never seen the channel before but I've watched a bunch now and I've laughed more in the last ten hours than I have in the last 10 months.
he can just play ANY game far from the way it was intended, yet be more successful than most of us lmao
Why is Grace known as “shark” today? :(
live love sail, but not live love raft..? uninstall.
Josh’s creations are our literal nightmares that shouldn’t exist.
I always respect your commitment to the bit. You put in way more hours than you need to.
This was the most entertaining thing I’ve seen in a while. 20 minutes felt like 5.
I imagine how the robots from that big ball place that had a whole city and had a boss saw how you built a long plank with detailed planks skipping danger
Boooooooo!!!!!!!!
YESSS HE UPLOADED ANOTHER RAFTTTTTT
it remind me your satisfactory mess xD
Christmas came early
How much wood is that
Let's game it out is the definition of " I did a little bit of stuff off camera"
Josh can you please play more planet coaster also huge fan love your videos
Videos like this are so dope to me. I would have never thought to use the planks to clip me through.
I respect the nado
It feels broken
this is the only guy who I believe when he put like "9 hours later"
Man really did a Minecraft to complete Raft💀
Imagine if Gray still plays and let’s game it out do a Collab
This tornado raft reminds me ov V'ger :)
yes i missed josh he havnt posted in a loooooooonmg tiume for a raft vid
This game looks perfectly balanced with no exploits.  I've never seen your channel, or this game before. Somehow the algorithm deemed you worthy. I was not disappointed, quite the entertaining video of breaking a game.
Wait is Raft Swedish? At 10:40 it says “Vasagatan”, a main road in Sweden
Ah yes, Josh from Let's Game It Out; breakin' games and takin' names
Er
grass
“And here I was ready to locate some crimes”  I think you are forgetting about your crimes against physics
This was pretty funny lol
Man skip everything
raft world
25:18 and i had to laugth soo hard xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD never stop making such videos pls :DDDDD
I dont know if you will see this but i think you will like far cry 5,you can rake messing with people to a whole new level,from robbing,to killing allies,punch them etc
this narration is insane 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Have you done or had offers for voice work?
i was so mad at you until the outhouse
That was insane .
It’s some kind of SCP
Goodbye Detail Plank... we hardly knew ye. Thanks Josh... *grumble grumble*
I’m convinced that on the last day of 2020, if you looked up at the sky, you would hear “I hope you had fun I know I did.”
He should do a vid on the new astroneer update BECAUSE IT HAS ROLLERCOASTERS.
How are you that determined to open a safe without the code?
josh zoo new dlc DO IT NOW BEFORE I STUFF YOUR HEAD IN THE FIRE PLA- by the way your videos always make me smile cuz of the DEATH AND DISPARE
12:08 wtf
2000 IQ
Thats the way to play the game.... I done it competly wrong -.-
You're an absolute legend man. Well done.
I have to say this game looks like fun. Especially with all the clipping and stuff. Please dont change that!
Been waiting for almost two years and now it’s back.
What a strange game, and an exceptional explanation
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be!
He forgot the rhino shark trophy
This is art
hey you should do astroneer  again theres a new train update
With the amount of games Josh crashes, he needs to partner with the developers and have them record their reactions to watching Josh destroy their seemingly indestructible game in every possible way
3:42 flower*
I’m surprised your game hasn’t crashed
Average exploring fan Vs Destroying Law of Fisics Enjoyer be like
"Screen saver from twenty years ago" - wow, that really unlocked memories I had looooong buried.
Josh's capacity to deal with himself is incredible
Josh, you *never* broke a single game. You just found *your own *, most enjoyable *way* in exploring different kinds of worlds! And we‘re so thankful to be a part of your journeys.
im scared of the day this man decides to be an architect
How come I've never heard of this channel before? I'm gonna be busy binging this for a bit.
I don't think I've ever seen a more fitting an end to a game.
the ending turned out perfectly :D
How does he have anofe wood for that much planks
i REALLY want graystillplays and lets game it out to do a vid together lol  they can takeover theworld ahah
Grace, is that you?  *emotional music intensifies*
I like how he follows the CGP Grey rule of thumb for uploading; no schedule, just post a good quality vid when you can get it done.  It shows that this system works (once one has the subs ofc, as Josh didnt always post like this, used to have a real schedule) for providin not just top quality vids for viewers, but tons of engagement that drives new viewers to the content which is gonna be so much better than the daily or even weekly channels that keep a true schedule.   And unlike vids on channels with consistent uploads, your views for vids dont drop off nearly as much after the first day, instd aome of your subs find it a day or more later, or hit watch later and come back to it in a week bcuz they wanna dedicate time to rly watch this vid and enjoy it cuz they know its gonna be quality.  Take as long as you need, but dont take so long as to aim for perfect, aim for a good quality (~80% grade or so) vid instd of always seekin to fix one more little thing til you get the perf vid.  Theres a balancin act between aimin for quality and aimin for at least postin enuf vids to keep makin the income you may need to survive. But im glad that Josh has found such here to the pt where i wudnt be shocked if this channel climbs over 5m subs by the end of the yr.
I have never played this game before, but something tells me this isn't intended by the developers. 🤷‍♂
Just so funny. Pls keep on. Loved ur valheim episode
I wanna see josh break wobbledogs
Bruce?
So funny that i never boring watch your explanation
The real MVP ended up being the string lights
12:00 I knew it was gonna be something ridiculous but this was so over the top I actually LOLD
19:01🤣
We need a RAFT developers reaction video.
when you see it 15:23
Whenever you make a game, you should definitely let josh test it out
This whole video is just a case of not knowing if I should laugh or cry
WTF?!
OMG I love your videos. I know he threw bombs at you and incapacitated you but don't worry "you're fine"
As a raft player, I never had an idea what the plank was for. Now I sure do.
I was watching this while there was a tornado warning
Great let’s game it out as figured out how to implement satisfactory tornado of conveyor belts into raft
Why did he change his YouTube name
U should do a ark survival evolved video
Lovely ... How not to play RAFT XDD
Hahaha.. This was really fun to watch 😂🤣🤣
Pls play wobbledogs!!!!
Hearing that intro is amazing
"With just one item" Makes every item
floor is lava belike
Love broken games! 😂
Gotta admit the patience of this man, he did his hardest
i bet the game is more fun this way hope they never patch this xd
Devs: adds a mundane cosmetic building item Josh: we're gonna, number one victory royale
that tornado ....  *satisfactory flashback*
Josg: shark friend  Grace(the shark): >:
I know a game you can play plants vs zombies there's a lot of stuff to mess with
I feel like you are what they call a “long speedrunner”
What item was it?
The monotone excitement the entire video made this hilarious 😂
Lol
I love this guy he just the funniest
NICE
what
Foolish to assume Josh is bound by physics
This could be a speedrun tatic
SUBBED
You are hilarious.
This is like the birth of V'Ger
Time to enjoy my victory mango… MMMM skin and everything delish
love your content bro! first time seeing this game and channel. big like :D
This entire video will never make me play Raft ever again.
back to tNice tutorials or other tutorial videos anyti. Don't push yourself too hard.
I too would be scared and would release the hyenas if a wooden eldritch horro would extend phasing through stone, glass, and metal trying to reach me. We can't blame that poor dude on Utopia.
Does the title avatar look like he's judging you?
Live your channel 😂😂😂 when she asked for helped and you said “not going to happen I came for one thing”
Detail board
I started watching you on your first zoo episode. I’ve watched you ever since and you never seem to get boring. :)
he just made a floating abyss o_o ...
Also i understand you power, brute force. Most thing will break under enough pressure and time. If you try everything past its intend use you will end up finding some weird at some point XD
555555555555+
From a technical point, I think we should applaud the developers that your tornado invention could actually exist and allow normal gameplay
Josh you should partner up with GrayStillPlays for a video
i didnt laugh once
👁👄👁
ITS WORKING! nice job dude
BRUH MY NAME IT TEMPRANCE!!!!!
stress
You never cease to entertain. Thank you for your patience and commitment to tomfoolery!
Josh's videos somehow make my day 10 times better, every time I see his video pop up in my notifications.
The madness... the madness!
There would be enough rubbish in the ocean to actually do this.
❤
When I saw the thumbnail I knew it was gonna be a good one😂
I just realized josh gets the games early because he's a game tester.
DAMN this Game suck XD
I love when Josh takes ONE item or feature and uses that to absolutely break the game.
first video i watch on pc YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
You, drae, and gray plays would be an amazing colab
i got nothing 💀
The developer who made the variable plank watching this video be like 😐
Hello Josh, try to broke game named Teardown, it will be funny :)
ITS BACK
Ahh yes the series
I wonder if you can make a raft under water with this method, then break off all other parts above water except for one platform to let you clip walk into the water again.
I love your vids but why did you not call the shark grace?
next time anchor your boat and just create a plank bridge to all the islands :D
You are so funny
Josh just causally taking a walk down memory plank. 19:49
I hope they never patch that wooden board.
I'm really curious how far vertically the planks can go. Could Josh explore the clouds? No-clip into heaven my dude.
Wait, you should totally stay in the launch capsule and then have someone else launch you while you're in it!
This is so good dude ty
23:22  demonetized
I want to see a dev reaction to this
Hilarious... at least they have WIFI.
Going everywhere like Fortnite but not even in that game could you pull off a tornado 🌪️ raft 🤣never thought I'd see the day
*FUN MANGO FACT: if you get poison ivy before eating mangos... Poison ivy rash will return every time you touch or eat mangos*
OLOF?! WAIT...!! 😳😮
I’m so sad you didn’t name the shark “Grace”
He took "The Floor Is Lava"  game to far
this is crazy lol
Josh figuring out speed run strats
I've been sick with a bad back my teeth have been hurting bad teeth sinus pressure sinus infection depression this dude's videos are really amazing and make you think about all your problems are not so bad or just something we normally have to deal with but this makes you think less about reality thanks man too help me get through my sickness 👍
You should try exploiting scrap mechanic. Has A LOT of potential!
I think josh is so old what hes time is 9 hours = 9 minutes, and hes with that time speed is around 256 years old
its crazy how he can manage to have fun with gams that are very repetitive especially while doing stupid stuff
15:23 727 WYSI
Please more videos  on YouTube
Pucci didnt need dios diary to reach tp heaven he just needed you
Do u have enough time to get in the top part that lounches in the see after u entered the code?
is this a re upload??
"MY ARMY WILL CRUSH YOU!" it was very literal Because you are just getting stepped on
He had to individually set each and every single plank to make that tornado raft....
that tornado raft crack me up real bad lmao
25:59. 23:30
I just love watching these tongue in cheek videos.  Nothing stops him having fun.  Great job as usual. Thanks.
7:50 hey, it's Moira Brown from Fallout 3!
when Josh says"let me give u the grand tour" U KNOW UR GANNA SEE DEMONS NIGHTMARES MOSTER HUGE CHAOS AND UR EYES WILL FALL OUT THIS IS NOT HATE
I have no words to say after seeing all the stuff this guy did, he violated the game do badly
I think the only reason those people were locked in the shed is because they wanted to hide from Josh
Do pocket ants
JOSH, THERES A NEW WAY TO TORMENT THE CLASSIC GAME ASTRONEER, GO DO WHAT U DO BEST..
olaf : I have an army! Lets game it out : we have planks
Honestly I thought this is gonna be one of those clickbaits but oh boy I didn't regret watching it now
Raft Speedrun: Tower of Babel%
You could make a whole civilization inside that tornado raft
Wow, Sam Hyde was correct about the future Trash Cube Economy.
He really likes his tornadoes...
Sooner or later we will see Josh bounty on every game
The game developers probably went bald after pulling their hair out after watching this video 😂
now lets hop on a "board"
Love your videos, and the way you play these games. Having said thst, I have a game recommendation. The game is called Banished. It's basically a medieval city builder. You can create absolute mayhem in this game, especially if you have the debug commands. I play this game aswell, so I'd love to hear another gamers opinion. -Al
IGN should have a Devs React to this specific vid.
Two point campus is out now!!! !!!!!!!!!!!
the only obnoxious thing is you acting like u didn’t know all that stuff was possible before the video. jesus christ
devs: Look how they massacred my game!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lmfao "Lets watch it melt" *boilp* "Gimmi dat" *Grabs molten copper with his bare hand*
V.   ?
"Oh god, do I need  care?" Is the most reliable thing I've ever heard 🤣
Damn bro i was gonna try and play the game... but after i saw your video nvm you just beat the game for me hahahaha.
PLAY GOREBOX ANIMOSYTY!!!
why does this feel like a Speedrun with all the speed and running taken out?
good old memories
the most chaotic walkthrough i could ever ask for
Product Manager: We'll add planks to the game. It's more for show and won't do much.   Product Manager watching this video: Dear God!!  Wake up the developers NOW!!
It's like subnautica lite
_tries to decapitate with an axe_ "Hey! A friendly face!"
Olof? The soldier named "Olof" on the video might be foOl                   You know what word on the soldier named "Olof"?
Everything you did was very "above board"
Just hire this man and to test out a game to find bugs.
FINALY A NEW EPISODE!
Raft makes me think of rust but with sims
Get ready slaves to work in the Meta Verse for pennies. Buy XRP/XLM to get out.
*Detail planks...*
this guy sounds like a lower pitched draegast
Surprised the raft developers haven't made a wanted sign for josh
man rly sat there trying every single code possible
You have to play two point campus sometime!
Anybody else feel like the soldier guy in Utopia is dressed awfully similar to one of the soldiers that escorts President Al Fulani in Cod MW?
is there a video on that zipline raft?????
HOW DOES HE HAVE SO MUCH WOOD?
So good
This was pure art
josh would you ever consider doing a collab with spiff?
I like to imagine that the devs are just watching this like "what the frick did this dude do to our game"
Can you do more satisfactory?
Mate...
The snow place called jet ski
Hilarious! 😀
You should play cities skylines
bro NEEDS to do Jurassic World Evolution 2. It's like planet zoo, but wiht dinosaurs
Please tell me the developers didn't patch the detailing plank. I know its pretty much a cheat code but I'm willing to buy the game right now if I could emulate what Josh has done.
bro so bad
WE NEED MORE JOHNNY HOYBODY!!!
Ayo when you going to start posting again? Love your content soo please keep post
Would love to see you destr- I mean enlighten the world of Astroneer good sir.
Been waiting for Grace’s comment for days now
You need to play a game called rust
This guy is so funny it's worth it.
Me: dy know Let's Game It Out? My lil brother: no? Me: thats the god of breaking games!
Please play just cause it’s a really good
2:56 this was my moment where I quit the video
More the long drive
‘If god won’t let u into heaven, the detailed planks will’
If she just put a one piece of the raft and it crashes
Its great to see that there a new raft vid, hope to see more
Josh can you pls shoutout
Little does josh know, hes just changed how raft speedruns are gonna work
Isn't your shark's name Grace?
Game developers should just get him to play the game and they can use that to fix bugs
You completely broke the  entire game the second you spawned items? wawe such talent
hahahahaha,.....good one! :D
Oh nooo
I feel like the game developers are slowly starting to adapt the rendering just in case he plays the game
Bro can break every game
At this point in the oceans pollution,  you could probably get away with living like this on the Atlantic,  Idk if thats funny or sad but there you have it.
The Peter Pan reference @ 27:11 🤣🤣🧚🏽
Bro literally count till 5,964 🤣🤣🤣
zamn
Brilliant, enjoyed watching this so much.. 😂😂 a total menace.
Speed running be like
That ending was just chef's kiss, dear god
imagine this, but like, 100 player online multiplayer
boring
Elden ring please
You always just make my day
Remember guys throw trash into the Ocean, some guy floating on a wooden raft needs it to create man made horrors beyond our compression.
omg this video was so hilarious. Well done :D.
Great
What do you mean ur playing raft that's fortnite 💀
"when Josh is gonna play raft, remember, Grace Will always be there... Always"
Good Live Come Laugh Who Float Sail  By Charlie Day
I love josh vids
Just me or does josh remind you of greystillplays?
Funniest sequence breaking video ever made
i am unsure if i should hate or love you oO !!
we need another astroneer video where you mess around with the new rails
28:17 Realistically, I think it would be easier to chop that bamboo with an axe instead of trying to find something to crack the locks with.
You are the real genius  Hats off to you
Watching half hours video without double click my screen..yes..only here..
Ah yes, another average play through.
This oddly feels like a speedrun strat lmao
ok the part where you virtually drowned somebody was less cool but ok
The frustration he must feel when playing games must be unreal...
only if the research table was in rl
Little did we know he read the shadow clone scroll
"If I can't use it or knock it over, what's the point?"  Josh is the literal definition of a cat
Play BTD6 (day5)
That's some kind of overpowered Wood Release Technique
dang why you love breaking games
Vine goo before furnace???
I k a game that u can’t mess with it called goat simulator and it’s already so messed up so u cant mess with it
Is this clevelan
This was quite amusing. What a hot mess and LMAO@2:47. 😆 Seems like the game has evolved quite a bit since I last played. I think I need to give it another go.
Raft but fortnite
i'm so glad you made another video, i missed your amazing content
design plank looks like a mini version of the wood build from fortnite
this is hilarious thanks for the giggles this games looks fun!
Noooooooooooooooooo 😲😧😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😛
Raft devs: Could you please dont?  Josh: Sure! "skips 80% of the game by clipping into everything"
7:42 "Hey a friendly face!" "Let's not go that far" 🤣
"think outside the box" LOL
Weird tutorial
you are born to break games
top speedrun in category any%🤣
i'd like to see the developer's face watching this...
I love these vids josh you find brilliant ways too  brake the game
Good 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅
I hate mango
If someday somebody opens a door to multiverse my first guess would be JOSH!
“My cup runneth over!” Always scares and excites me. Send help. But also, “Go on….”
Someone please help, what is the name of that "success" sound effect that plays around 9:08? I want the wav of it so bad!
I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. 🤣 thanks so much
I missed u
I don't know who this man is, but I absolutely adore his throat choppable voice.
08:21:51
I did not expect this
Josh and gray should collab
Lol
This, this is the best Raft gameplay I ever seen in my entire life
josh "everytime i seen there is exploits in the game, i will use it wisely"
29:06 that is the first time I heard Josh burst out a laugh like that
Obviously raft chose you,
Josh!~
Sailor:Captain looook Captain:What's that 12:34 *tornado raft approaching menacingly* Captain:Dear god
Pls put lights on the tornado 😂
I love how you post once a month that just tells everybody how good you work for your videos
It's not a bug it's a feature
30:35 "Now _this_ is a boss battle I can get behind." This journey was transcendental. I almost wish that I were very weed-high for it, like so far gone that I'm not sure if what's happening is really happening.
Please tell me that you can log into the game and see his tornado on the title screen as one of the raft builds
Can you play jalopy in your special way please?
Josh has a buff grind buff BUT he wastes it
W
It's actually very entertaining, like some sort of mystical adventure about 'The Boy with a Magical Hammer'
I love how easily Josh can just snap game mechanics in half like a twig.
The tornadoes here to hang out for a bit
I bloody love this channel. Breaking games 1 at a time.
These are really quality videos
Bust 🤩 boost 💚🦑 nice video
Josh for April fools just do a video where you play a game normally and act like nothing is different
Why does everything turn into a tornado?
Something tells me he wasnt in survival mode
Yay
Masterful!
i wish josh had a 2nd channel where it was all unedited and we could see all of his pain 🤣
bro got a master key :/
19:23 - 19:25 stupid question, was that scream added in post, or does the lady scream if you leave her in there before launcing? 😂
Never thought the game can be played like this, thank you Josh
Yeah last looks like hell I know you like that stuff that your laugh does
I died when he was building the altitude for the radio signal😂😂
I’m sad Grace didn’t get very much screen time this time, maybe this was a different shark friend but I love your content regardless!
When josh say "give me one minute" that means hours    Josh where is our grace?
Where are you getting all this amazon boxes from a stranded place?
He for real built a floating beyblade raft
Only you break games at this level
If it ever turns out reality is a simulation, Josh will probably be the first one to find a way to break out
played just as intended
I think you should play slime rancher, aka ball compacting sim
hilarious! Well done An organized good video on breaking the short minded rules of a training exercise/ game.
make a deal with the devil is like send a game key of your game to josh
12.21:20 MST
u have lot time
"Josh the board lord"
he should work for companies as a bug reporter lol
The devs are going to patch this so quick
im amazed he can make a video a month
Game: solve the puzzle Josh:  literally thinking outside the box
Hurricane US
Seast he day... eh?
First
that golf map is in cod mobile
I like how once he got the detailed planks, it's game over for him.
When I hear you playing raft me  Oh god he's gonna make a gigantic mechanism of lag
Wait... how many viewers actually remember the 3D pipes screensaver?
Never clicked a video faster
Are you a tax attorney? If not you should be one.
Do you play Minecraft?
YEEEEESSSSS BROO
board    bottom text
Can't believe i watched the whole 30mins of this video without getting bored whatsoever 😂😂😂 Thank you!!
speedrunning gonna look fun for this
2:55 The Collector in me just stopped working xDDDD
So what mod/exploit is he using to have infinite materials to do this?
Thios is Amazing! omg.
the planks made me think my computer cracked
You call it a “raft tornado,” I call it a floating weaver bird nest
I like this more than I should
PLAY ASTONEER AGAIN THEY JUST ADDED TRAINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I haven’t seen this game in literally 6 years I’m so confused lmaoo
I sub because I love how he destroys and abuse bugs in such huge sense of humor.
The developer: No, you can't just use the Detail tool to cheat at the game!  Josh: *haha plank extender go brrr*
i bet he can no-clip to the backroom with the power of detail plank
You and gray still plays should collab if you did I would die of laughter
04:47:48
4:14 thought it said “Live Laugh Fail” hahaha
Wtf is Falcon from Gameranx doing here I'm telling!
Josh would be a great speed runner 😂
I have an idea : Can you play overcrowded?
The game walkthrough all we wanted. Thanks joss
9:37:51 PmM
Josh breaks games for a living🤣🤣
we found Olofs or olafs weakness… BOARDS.
Idk if it’s your game style but could you break besiege next please
I don't know why this was recommended, and I don't know why I decided to watch it, but in all honesty this video was very entertaining.
Yup, its a game it out build made by josh, that telltale hurricane. Though, I still feel he could have used those planks better, is there any real reason he actually had to row or move his raft anywhere? Maybe go the extra mile and build a bunch of actual floating wooden huricanes?
I didn't know the game had a story. I've never watched anybody go this far.
04:11:20
I started gasping and yelling for joy meant once I saw this video.
04:09:00
Ur the best josh
Well, as they say, the devil is in the detail(plank)s
i love this 11:55
He would be a perfect game tester
mister your scary
not sure why this was Recommended but I'm truly thankful it was
Subnitica try it
Wow
Imagine game developers watching this guy.
Something about raising the curtain just after learning how to make it was really funny to me
If they patch the infiniboard … we’re all blaming you.
Why is at some points he sound like Cleveland from Family Guy?
good game
This takes planking to a whole other level.
First a tornado in satisfactory then one in raft
man axed a woman and she be lik oh a friendly face💀💀💀
Tornado raft, LOL! That's what earned my subscription.
Josh and tornadoes prove that time is a flat circle
This channel popped up on my suggested vids and I have to say it is one of the funniest channels I’ve seen and no other channel has had me laughing with every single vid like it. Not sure how it slipped by me but I’m pleased because I get to enjoy the entire back catalogue….
I'm glad video games exist. This is a clear example of how video games keep the really creepy people inside.
20:37 "If I can't use it or knock it over, what's the point?" really captures a lot of the spirit of this channel
great vid earned a subscriber
just imagine a collab with josh and spiff
OMG HOW AM I 4 DAYS LATE?? I LOVE THESE RAFT VIDEOS!!!
Epic
Every video you make of Raft should just be titled, "I broke it again."
_OSHA intensifies_
Bro he invented a new type of way to Speedrun this game
this man is so patient
i dare anyone to count how meny times he breaks the laws of physics  in this video
A boss fight in raft. Interesting.
When he said "like a air horn" it sounded like he was smothers from the simpsons😂
my guy spent many years to create this masterpiece
ZMM on the ASX. 99.3% down. Huge investment opportunity?
I hope they never patch this plank trick lol
24:51 Game: "Door is locked from the other side" Him: "Well I'm sorry you feel that way door"
This looks completely pointless. Like Minecraft on the water with better graphics
Raft Adventure Line  (tm)
My only reaction to seeing the giant behemoth of a funnel was: "What the actual f***"
I love just the calm voice during the whole plot of this video, Not gonna lie He kind of sounds like bill Cipher from gravity falls.
Perfect.
When the shark destroyed the storage tower, I felt anger I've never felt before. I've never hated an animal so much in my life.
NOOOOO THE TREE
I love what Josh did i just wished he did something with the snowmobile.
Masterpiece
not gonna lie in every video I would be surprised if there was no glitch found..
#1 youtuber. I always check his content list and when i see a blue dot I get SO EXCITED. I like the theme park ones. Can you do more Josh?
Lets just appreciate how insane his videos are. Josh used SIMPLE TOOLS TO TORTURE PEOPLE IMMSNELY
I love why John makes mayhem and chaos :')
10/10 enjoyed + sub. This is content people
Who laugh in this video so many time 🤣🤣
I used to play a similar game in my keypad phone. I remember I had tons and tons of supplies. But one day to my utter suddenness I found that someone had deleted the game.
I love how no one is talking about Josh brute forcing the lock again because it's just expected of him to do that
This is my first time watching your videos and It feels like I read a page of words with no full stops
Is that “utopia” picture a place you can go to ?
TIL Sharks love graham crackers
Best RAFT video ever made. Lol
Same tornado from that one factory game
he cheats the items in right? right? he has to
The entire time I couldn’t tell if he was board or sarcastic or mad but I loved it
How much ya wanna bet every time this guy uploads another video, the devs' QA all go "Ok, what'd we miss?"
no no no those blocks are spelling help
Perfect ending.
🤣your videos just keep getting better
what is wrong with your voice
19:11 The sound effects 😂😂😂
You know a quest is annoying when the master of spending too much time on a thing, isn’t willing to spend any time on the actual quest. XD
I know you could just use a trainer or something to give yourself infinite string lights, but I really like to believe that you placed every one of them individually just for us. Honestly I think you've done more insane amounts of work in videos like these.
its sad that lets game it out gets the least watched of my youtubers because it takes him a month but he does make the best content
Pulling out the speed run tactics I see
🤣🤣🤣
This might be the most entertaining video I've ever watched.
Technically, Josh is a professional bug/glitch tester
cringe
I love the way you always come up with super ridicolous ways to play the game
Thank you for this immersive video! Enjoyed watching from anywhere around the world. 👍
Thank you for the laughs :) really awesome video 👍
This will give nightmares to The person who gave the idea of customizable ramps at the game design meeting.....
this was my first exposure to raft. 10/10
I liked and reported this for promoting terrorism
I'm pretty sure that all game devs will immediately resign if Josh is hired as QA tester.
plz play wobbly life or beamng drive
It is IMPRESSIVE how much he broke this game
I’m srsly wondering how much wood he has
Btw scientists predicted all the flooding so thus they chose you and a few others to go onto earth and they used their new machine breaking physicist sense to make no sense
Josh has been here for too long that even the sentence "And Here We Are!" Is bone chilling. No it's not because of a Kirby game, definitely not that
Ah yes, we all love to see let’s game it out beat every game the way the creators intended
10:15  Raft devs: write that down cawowski
How to break the game logic:
each video takes about 5 months to make
I Completely Broke the Entire Game by Spawning in Items
They better not patch it. You only cheat yourself and detail planks are really nice
your PC okay after this? lol
I love how Josh finds bugs in EVERY GAME. His out-of-the-box thinking is on another level. Imagine him and Forsen collabing, no game would be safe lol.
What a crapfest of a game where every single physics can be broken...
You should defo play Jurassic world evolution 2 since it's your conquest to break everygame
Now there's a video developers will absolutely love.
dont play ark... totally play ark
I wish they had this game on the Nintendo Switch though
Floor is lava  Mfs in 2015:
That epilog is perfect. 😂😂😂
Amazing youtuber
I'd like a reaction video from the dev team. Can we all push for that ?
Break the laws of Physics? Planck constant is a thing in quantum mechanics though
What’s the matter? YouTube tell you that you can’t call the shark Grace anymore because some REE REE threw a fit?
Anyone else wishing that Josh would bring Anthony back for at least one more video?
5:58 "...looks like a screensaver from 20 years ago..." oh god, he's right..👴
Lets game it now
Hey Josh, how has Anthony been doing?
Man is a really good qa tester
Ouchi :D
My dad and I recently got satisfactory because he loves factory games, he hadn't known that I'd already watched you play it for a long time and eventually he found your content whilst searching for things he could upgrade with on satisfactory, you're literally his favorite youtuber now. We made a little skating rink for that miniature car in the game. You've got epic content you even appeal to a father and son. Great work man.
Best youtuber ever
I cant believe i i’ve  missed this much since I been away,  still going hard 💪🏾🖤
6:07 it just reminds me climbing on old satelite towers in far cry 3
Let's game it out, a game dev's worst nightmare
josh with boards is just lockpicking lawyer but stupid
You should check out cult of the lamb
He posts a video about crazy rafts while I’m at a scout camp building a raft…
24:10 he thought he was playing dying light
Me as someone who finished the game the intended way literally like 2 days ago: WHEEZE
this guy is hacking so hard lol. you can see him cheat engine'ing all his supplies. he pretty much ruins the game for himself. and also he would save 90% more of his editing time if he stopped zooming in on something every 5 seconds.
Perfection.
josh will find a way to make tornados in every game regardless of what it is
Please play ark
How is this 1# treding for gaming?
I'd like to see josh program something.... The possibilities.  "So we're going to try to do some math... Oh look we broke time." -Josh says turning his webcam out of his window to see earth's sky box flashing between day and night in mere seconds.
Your fun
Is this Shroud 2nd channel?
So it's a game about how a mean white guy keeps a bunch of black and brown 'rafters' down who keep turning beautiful utopias into ugly rafts?    We live in a society.
[your fine]
That was oddly beautiful ❤️
All hail the almighty adjustable plank!!!
XD
How much wood does he have?
Fantastic ending! 🤣🤣
Remember like a year ago when you said you would make part two in a few days 😀
First time on this channel but the commentary is hilarious xD
Josh’s patience though
man I already finish this game.  then watch u play so mind blowing but works lol
wait till he finds out that you can just pick up the mango, yes u can chop it down but like, just pick it off the tree
That is funny as heck.
THE MOANS😭
Wouldn't the boat sequence be faster if he just went the normal way?
Your voice is amazing ... love your vids
oh, i just remembered a VERY old "Tom and Jerry" cartoon, where Jerry sneaks up behind Tom with an Air Horn... *HONK!* Tom LITERALLY jumped out of his fur!
this gameplay is just wrong and i love it
The hours you put in are insane haha.
* Why use hands when you can build up to heaven  *  Let's game it out
2:44 I knew it that shark will bite it you should think
You should be a QA tester XD
you keep surprising me , a tornado this time 🗿
how are you sane
Isn’t that shark Grace, Josh?
Can you Narrate some National geographic
Your the only Tuber that I watch the whole video no fast forward
"old fashioned screensaver"... reminds me of a crazy story, i think it was on "the daily wtf", where a company was having intermittent problems with their network going REALLY slow... they eventually figured out it was the screensaver on the boss' PC.  yes, that "pipes" screensaver. BUT the boss REFUSED TO BELIEVE IT. they eventually had to give him a SECOND PC, unconnected from the network, with JUST that screensaver and NO other programs!
Dictator san's utopia is still running perfectly
That was a perfect Josh ending: People walking around and someone throws bombs on themand everything is burning
Ahhhhhhhh 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
This guy had a lot of free time!
You should make “let me give you the grand tour” into a shirt. With fire around it.
clipping through walls is fun until you end up in the backrooms
Cant imagine how fun and unexpected a subnautica one off would be ( it honesly would be rly funny xD )
May I request you play Slime Rancher?
I forgot about this man I love this content I can’t wait to watch some of his new vids
What is the best method to enjoy a game.... by skipping its story XD
This is my idea of an ideal speedrun
I love this channel
Is the game on ps4 or pc
the title alone just screams that it's a _"normal"_ LGIO video
Is that lyle mcdouchebag?
bro could do a speedrun of the game
Should just anchor it after tornado, and then build directly to each location… 1800 meter plank to next objective…
your voice makes me both intrigued and angry at the same time
Nice Video , can you try Factorio next time maybe?
this dude made a precursor base out of wood
What do you people  think  his next video will  be
Yes
The suggestions of physics
You just became a nightmarish eldrich abomination of wood. You casually defy all laws of physics and biology to travel unharmed threw walls following goals that are beyond any and all comprehension. You even copy and make people cease to exist with your antics, just look at that military dude constantly dematerializing and returning with another non threatening challenge only to be cloned at the end.
please please PLEASE explore the bottom of the ocean with the detail plank protections :D
When are you going to play with Anthony again
best betatester ever XD
no FPS drop with that monstrosity? that's good to know.
RAFT!
This is the greatest video ever
It took all of 15 seconds for me to decide that I want to subscribe to this channel
@captainsauce he found a person 😆
You should get a job being a big tester
22:57 thought andrew tate was going to pop out
I think Game developers Love and Fear you extremely
I love you
This is cool. But your voice is so annoying
🤣😂🤣😅
Dude this entire video is cursed
Another great job.
i've never played Raft but i don't think it could ever be as fun without Josh's commentary playing a different kind of way 🤣
As always, I love your videos. Keeps me laughing the whole time.
I actually watched this til the end. It was very entertaining.
Ha did it take you 8 times longer to beat the game then everyone else?great video
finally i waited for this
so i just figured out how to clean up the oceans ... hear me out we take all the illegal dumpers and put them on a raft in the middle of the ocean and let them work
This game is magnificent!
Love sharing ur raft stuff
Your raft is like abstract art
Joshs voice was the only reason I subscribed 4 years ago. Bring back Anthony tho plz
Gotta say, never imagined the wood version of the Silver Surfer would be so creepy.
MAAAAAAN WHERE'S SATISFACTORY??? WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FOREVER!!
Omg this is so cursed
Hey Josh, Can You Make A Planet Coaster Vid, Thanks.
Best Raft video ever! ✨⭐🌟
Josh sure loves his tornados🌪
that’s a hilarious way to play lol
The escalation of absurdity is absolutely and commitment to the exploit to sequence break in the most ridiculous ways is amazing
I love watching these game play throughs!
There is not a single thing that is sacred to Josh. He will phase through any doors he wants to. He will sequence break as he pleases. And you cannot patch this out, for he _will_ find a way around it.
What we learn with raft ,trow trash on the ocean to help people who are needing rescueing
Where the timestamp squad at?
astroneer glitch I just found a glitch that makes so you can float in space. if you go to sylva you can strap 2 hydrazine thrusters to the back of a large rover. then if you shoot up and get in you will launch into orbit and if you get out you are floating in space. if you dont get out you will literally launch to other planets without a rocket. try it out it might only be on console. astroneer btw
That long plank hahahahaha
ok, so now i know i will never be seeing that plank in the game again. Idk how many wood you collected but that was very clever
He plays fortnite on steroids
Man posted this a couple days ago and got 6.9M views
I need to see game devs reacting to Josh playing their game  lol
God damn how many hours you played this map.
i dare u to play a game the way its intendid
Baja snsjsj
You must have sold so many copies of this game
You are a blessing on this earth with your ability to completely ruin every game you encounter. viva la josh
Josh is the definition of pure chaos, anything Josh gets the key to he will make the most chaotic game. with a sprinkle of finding bugs, and glitches. 🤣
Tghu
Rtyu
what ever happened to Anthony
Okkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
He means the pre loaded 3d pipes screensaver
BELTNADO RIDES AGAIN
I didn't realize the tornado from your satisfactory series would make an appearance. Well done sir.
Since when did let’s game it out have 4.47 million subscribers, omg I haven’t watched in a while.
2:55 Well that's answered a question that's been ratling in my head for a while.
Olaf the wizard, master of deception and trickery
U could speed run the game with ur.gltiches bro, u should try 😁
ok, this actually looks like a really cool game!
he actually speedrunned the game LOL
Let me guess the sharks name is grace I already know
Can you imagine being that guy that had and pushed the idea for the design plank?.
XD forbidden expresso
your backk hahahahaha
Does this dude not know how to play? The first several minutes of the video is just horrible....go watch someone else that knows what they are doing. -.-
Anyone think that he has an obsession with planks?
I love josh law of physics , not newton law 💀☠️🤣
1 technique that work for every situation,i love it
Filipe Ramos
This game looks super fun!
Raft parkour maps need to be a thing
This asset flip is getting more absurd with each update.
I’m pretty damn sure that’s not how mango tree looks like
imagine the pain of the developers try to fix his expoit and gitches
When he says "My army will crush you!" it's referring to all the clones of himself that he's created. You think you imprisoned him but in reality it's merely 1 of his countless numbers.
P L A N K
Am I only the one who misses the part when he gets out from the ship?
He needs to be hired as a game tester to find all the glitches
Its..It's...perfect
This is the award winning game breaking
Are you doing this so the creators have bags to Fix
Decoration board Perfectly balanced 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Alternative video title: raft but 99% planks
love your videos they make me laugh😀😀😀
That rug really tied the raft together.

You can make the most boring game something that will make me smile for 30 minutes straight

Speedrunners Finding this Sequence Break and started doing strats around it
18:19 now it so much more fun haha........uh ...so muh more fun ...oooooooooooo im melting ...it s so much more fun..,.....uh.....su much more fun.   do u know what the meaning of fun?
You know that Josh broke the game when he says he’s going to do it his way
18:08 ..OMG,,,,y cnt you live vomeone vomenoe vomone .....
You have to do one on Grounded! That games build mechanics would be a lit of fun for your style lol
Bro broke the whole game...
make a WAY bigger tornado, like the size of a island
24:49 I love the way he says, "hello? Hellooooo?"
"looks like a screensaver from 20 years ago." 💀💀
Immagine devs canging every code to be 9999 so Whean Josh does another video he as to use BRUTE FORCE 9999 times
Josh is the IceMan of planks...
i just got 1 queston how
No way he said love bites📸📸📸📸📸🤨🤨🤨
For anyone reading this  Vertical pillar Attach 2 horizontal pillars Remove vertical pillar Floating horizontal pillars Attach foundation Funky flying raft
I guess they can't all be good videos
Can we all agree that the lack of click bait is probably the best part of this video? I was sure it would be, but I was honestly impressed.
the stability of this game is impressive, considering the number of objects, the game appears to treat them as one considering it is not lagging!
OK so I wanted to see how you used the detail plank to break the game then i realized you were gonna just joke around for 30 mins and... no.  Dont got time for that.
the way you break games is always astounding and the time you put into doing so is nothing short of amazing, but dear god have you been breaking raft spectacularly
guys he's four parallel universe ahead of us
.
Who new speed running while breaking the game was fun!!
I love the idea of a god who builds paths that ignore all laws of physics
play project zomboid plsss
29:09 bro's laugh just turned into a wizzard 💀
I think it might be another chapter where they have a wanted sign for Josh
what a beautiful lesson in hubris
Graystillplays and lets game it out are two halves of the same chaotic whole
23:22 😳
Tower of Babel: Raft Edition
R you ok
26:23 this had me dying
this will revolutionize raft speedruns
someone should hire this guy as a game tester though
Brruh
How many do you have
* oWWwwW *  "Your fine!"
Fax tho
String lights, more of the good stufff
9:08 "Your cup runneth over" We all know that this man listens to JT music now.
Why?
playing fortnie in raft
i'm like 90% sure he's cheating in the game to speed it upXD
I was not expecting that finale. Good one!
It was at 7:22 where it all went to heck
Okay, this game was MADE for this series
19:33 After watching Nope, I had a visceral fear of your man eating alien raft.
Yooo trending for Gaming let's go! Also why can I hear a bit of a low-voiced Vanoss once in a while in you?
I bet 2 Good Burgers Josh CANT build an ISLAND SIZED Raft💯
I bet 2 Good Burgers Josh CANT build an ISLAND SIZED Raft💯
3 days ago 7mil? tf
I'm currently sick right now with a stomach bug, and your videos make me feel way better. Thank you so much!
cool real
Play the game arc It's the biggest survival game and try taming all the dinosaurs and breeding them until you have have an army of dinosaurs
Love it love it love it
Build a man o war ship 😀
If i ever develop a game can i please send it to you to bug test it?
I can cheat my way out to heaven thanks to that detailed plank
Fun fact “?!” Is called an interrobang. Fun word for next time.
i like to think utopia is actually a evolved version of the old raft that josh made that was just a bunch of little rafts made into a hive
I wonder how many game testers fired after Josh's videos? :D
Hilarious!
Madman does it again
FACE REVEAL PLS
how to you have te patience to make that tornado like what
... why did i think you where doing a normal game  of coarse you found a loop hole in the game
Bro just turned raft into fortcraft
Developers: *adds plank. Josh: *I'm going to end this game's career.
Game: would you like to exploit th- Josh: yes game: but i- josh:YES
I have to ready myself for at least a day before watching each new video, because each one is more terrifying than the last as josh loses his sanity more and more  _10/10 would definitely recommend_
I love the immense capability if his consistency in breaking games religiously
Best thing to do to find potential exploits in Ur game let this man play it and fix it from there hah
How do u not just melt your mc????
I'd like to see the Raft devs real-time reaction to this 😂
Can you play AltF4 once? To break the game :)
Dunno who you are, random video that hooked me, funny stuff, maybe I'll check out your thers stuff now :)
He forgot the snow mobiles
needs to collab with josh
He just speed running this game..
your raft is so pretty i love it 🥰
Vasagatan = Vegetarian
Remember that the Lord Jesus Christ died on a cross for you because He loves you so much. He then rose up from the dead three days later. The Ten Commandments are called the moral law you and I broke the law Jesus paid the fine that’s what happened on that cross.  By accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior repenting of all sin you have done and putting all your trust in Him He will grand you everlasting life as a free gift  Repentance of sin means: regretting all your sins you have done and turning from it.
how does your pc still exist
Wow. That subtle Red Cross, stealthily educating people in a vidja game you are....
lol
The more freedom a game gives you to create abominations the better the game is
Ever since Anthony left josh has slowly become a manic in these games
The tornado escaped from the nightmare factory
oh hey there he is...
play my summer car
this is so hilarious 🤣 why bother doing the mission if you can use plank😆😆
So im assuming you killed the shark? Havent seen him around for a while...
12:03 It's RAFTNADO!
T-the f-f-flash b-backs 😰😰😰
this has to be one of his best 🤣
its raftin time!  remember this comment if you truly wanna know if God is Real or not. read ALL of it, and hopefully know that JESUS CRHIST is the true God. screenshot it or keep this comment somewhere to read later. this should prove that Jesus is Real. JESUS CHRIST will Not make you take any mark, and He will punish the tyrannical ANTI Christ. The ANTI Christ will get a terrible wound, but cure himself to reinforce his deception to decieve the non-Christians and the lukewarm Christians. (look up lukewarm Christians on Christian websites and/or the Bible.) the AC will be world famous and very popular. he will make people take a mark on r hand or forhead. there will be a severe punishment for not taking it. The ANTI-Christ is a control freak, the opposite of Jesus Christ. Jesus uses His power for GOOD, NOT EVIL. This is BIBLE PROPHECY. Dont trust the false god, his goal is to get people into the lake of fire. he  will go there too, despite all the FALSE MIRACLES HE WILL DO! Repent of your sins to Jesus Christ before its too late, you could die today! DEBUNKING BIGBANG:  if the bigbang was real sat turns ring particles should've moved too fast for ANY gravity to pull them towards the planet. And thats not even taking into account the bigbangs hot temprature which shoulda vaporized anything. also there is too little antimatter in universe. if bigbang was real 99.99999999999999999999999999% of our universe should Not exist because antimatter destroys matter when it make contact with matter. the bang wouldve made much of it touch matter. so we see far less stars n stuff bc the so called bigbang wouldve destroyed nearly all of it.
This man has more than 500x my patience.
This guy is the bane of developers
The Raft game can’t be broken This guy... I’ll find a way
I've never been so enthralled by someone's game-breaking and chaotic gameplay, I mean,,, if it works 😅
Bruce the shark
HAHAHAHHAHAHA
This update took so long just to be broken by 1 plank lmaoo
TRENDING #2!!!!!
dude at 18:55 the boards look like a hand
Raft added something and fixed all bugs... Lets game it out Really-?
He
The game devs are like oh, well a guy who finds bugs costs money, this guy does it for free!
best QA tester ever
Josh did you know there is raft mobile
Is it modded?
this video was uploaded 3 days ago and I havent watched this guy in months but youtube says ive watched it before
Game devs: WHY CANT YOU JUST PLAY THE GAME AS INTENDED Josh: *Breaking the game in unholy ways*
HAAAAAAAAAAA HAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
I don't know what I was expecting, but with Josh, Raftnado was always a possibility
Have you tired to make squid game in planet coaster
For those wondering, Shark Friend name = Grace
THIS RAFT IS OUT OF CONTROL
People on the island must be like Person1: “Hey, John. You said it’s gonna be windy today right?” John: “yeah, what’s the problem Richard?” Richard: “There seem to be a wooden tornado coming towards us” John *chuckles* : “Don’t be silly, trees don’t grow on the sea” *R.A.F.T slowly approaches* John: “Dear god”
Imagine the game developers reading a bug report from this dude.
This video reminds me of the dog inside a building on fire mem.it’s like nope this isn’t broken nothing to see here everything is just fine
Tip: To run Raft on Vista, launch in compatibility mode first. If you still encounter problems, try downloading more ram. It may also help to open the optical drive and blow in it.   Not going to lie, you're going to need a pretty powerful rig to play at even 30 fps. I recommend Alienware, best out there right now. I camped out at Walmart last Black Friday and snagged a nice little Nvidyah GTX 420ish edition (DLSS and Raytracing are overrated friend, outdated tech for the peasants and non sub plebs). My GTX 420ish launched with CnBT Blast Processing AMZ Rydan CPU @ 9000 GHz, Liquid Bush Beans cooled, AOL Discord Platinum 2 year subscription. Downloadable Steam code for 48 gigs of Trident Z DDR6 RAM 🔥😎🔥
I hope the Devs NEVER fix all this. It makes the game 100x more fun.
I miss Grace. 🥲
Wlŕmonn
"And obviously I don't have the key. I mean, unless you count my skeleton key." (@29:15)  Nice Skyrim reference there.
I sthere somewhere in the video this building from the thumbnail?
yeah, he cheats everything in  yeah, its funny as hell lol
You're about 25% as funny as you think you are, and I can tell you're trying really hard
Did you forget what her name was (cough cough grASe cough)
I love this channel.
Anyone else get mad at 25:25 because you wanted to see whats in the telescope.
I don't think I have laughed this hard in a long time. Thanks so much for your blessed shenanigans and for ignoring common sense.
Please play spore
Mieszne to. Wincyj!
Creater pov: why did we let let’s game it out play our game… our biggest mistake ever Lets game it out pov: lets break some stuff dat the game doesn’t want it  Dats all but by the way I like it it makes me laugh everytime
XD
Just another great video. So impressed Johh can find anything that can break, and then take it to the extrem :D
This guy is a gift for developers that want there game for stress test or bugs check
great now the game is going to get rid of that plank
could u pls buy me the game?
What is it with you and tornadoes, Josh?
God loves you all and you can all be saved (if not already) by just putting faith in Jesus Christ and repenting of sins (turning to God from sin and changing your ways for God) And you should ask for forgiveness of your sins have a nice day  Jesus is my lord! And the solution to hell! Hallelujah!  And I'm not a bot .. . ..
At this point his speed run this game
He should play scrap mechanic, I think he would like it.
Please tell me you used cheats for gathering all those materials.
TNice tutorials tutorial was so easy to understand. Thank you so much!
You have to appreciate the coding. Every other game would break after the 200th board.
I don't get the point of staying on a raft after finding an island.
16:31 Can it live there? Can it die there?
“good things come to those who float” give Pennywise vibes
I love that type of showing games because i don't get spoilers how to play this correctly (:
You just broke the game😂mission passed
im pretty sure this isnt considered spoilers to the game and will never be
Mobile?
I cant wait for the next Video :D
A horrific eldrich being named the Boardwalker, able to produce physics defying non-euclidian structures out of nothing, riding long snaking tendrils of wood to pass through solid matter and steal your stationary.
Bruhh..
Bruhh..
I was laughing so hard towards the end I nearly passed out.  Bravo, my good sir.
OMG RAFT
This cracked me also, not only the game... I was rolling with laughter! The code keypad was a nice touch... although several touches.
.
HES A MENACE
nice
*"Looks like they're trying to spell 'Hell'"*  I think they're trying to spell "Help!"
Is it me, or did the raft look like it was a tornado with lightning coming out of it??? If it was the closest thing to a real world version, I think.
I find it funny that Josh keeps finding community changing exploits that can forever change speedrunning for the certain game
I don't get the appeal of this game. It looks incredibly boring.
“Give me a few minutes” 9 hours later…
28:47 Looks like the obstacle course for Legends of the Hidden Temple!
Hey Josh, are you ...alright? You sound a lot less manic and diabolical than usual, and a little bit morose. Quite a big bit, actually. If it's the heat I completely understand, but if it's something deeper, please take some you-time. The internet can wait; go be with friends or a date or animals at the sanctuary. Whatever takes the edge off and makes you feel like you again. Take care man.
29:07 thast the real laugh of Josh , incase you don't know
Well, I am sure the developers are face palming now at the idea of adding customisable planks 🤣🤣🤣
This raft is cursed 😭 i can hear the devs going bald and pulling their hair out
This game actually looks like it'd be a pretty exciting adventure without all of Josh's dirty rotten cheating.
My bro really brute forced a code
speed runners learns from josh
I see this is all above board
I personally would love to see more satisfactory
12445
In every game, Josh plays the roll of a petty god that has found a way to use their meager influence to rend reality itself.
What a complete genius! 🌪
Vegetarian 😂
9:45 Just like Gromit laying down train track in "The Wrong Trousers."
Josh the King of Madlad
6.4 million views in just 3days 😳👏🏼 Power of strong fanbase😎🎉
Plz play spore
for a little reminder, you need a nasa computer to play this video
Bro thought this a Fortnite 💀
Lol speedrunners have probably already  figured  this all out
this is so chaotic, i love it
If i ever make a video game i will send Josh a key so he can discover the bugs and i dont have to work on discovering them
Good for you dude! You're so cool.
My man totaly didn't google those safe combinations ;)
I’m dying laughing watching this 😂
Amungojejsj us
Oh hello shark wait what are you doing
Lol one piece of wood can make that
playful bug tester
You became plankman
I think this guy can freeze time
If this was a tod Howard elder scrolls game there would be a blue screen of death Every 5-20 minutes without cheasing the game like the spiffing Brit
This is the first video of this channel I've seen and been binging the channel for like two days 🤣🤣🤣
dude can you please stop compressing your voice so much
Hurricane Us I couldn't breathe for 10 minutes lmaooo
This is definitely gonna get some work Also I can't believe you really brute forced that safe
Wait but how come he didn’t call the shark Grace this time?
Your raft has become a Lovecraftian monstrosity, and I love it!
Hamburger
Josh: jumps from a height that would break legs irl and takes a lot of fall damage Also josh: eh, you're fine
Dont show this to the devs
what have you got to enter this deadly place? "Detail Plank" now you are the god
Speedruns have gotten wierd
hes back with raft🤣
xD
I forgot about the god of a man, I shall resubscribe. (why did YT unsub me?)
new fortnite update be bussin
I absolutely love this guy 😂 you couldn't have made it any more entertaining
The way Josh breaks games is such an artform
Good to see the conveyer belt tornado make another appearance. 👌
LMAO, gotta love video game physics!
Hello, here is a challenge for you. Be normal for 1 episode.
wow. we learn another way to play.
The boards up to the island just had me dying of laugher
1  2  4  9
lets game it out why not do a episode where you become billionaire in real life
What raft
Game: 20 enemies and 15 padlocks on a door Josh: 👉👍
hahaha so funny 🤣
Jesus Christ died for your sins please repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand ....,
THIS IS SOOO GOOD
I wonder how many devs Josh has gotten in trouble
Did he just finished the game in one video??? A 30 minutes video at that
you are so inconsistent with your uploads and i love them so much i hate that your so inconsistent :(
30:08 So that's what happened to those Lion King hyenas after Scar left the picture
Once I figured out you can cancel grace's attack animation by stabbing her in the mouth as she lunges at you this game got a lot less fun for me.
You kinda sound like a cross between Drae and Graystillplays.
Damn mango in palm
Josh how has your pc not exploded if i press launch minecraft my pc explodes and shatter flaming hot as a tempature of the sun
Josh's humor and just attitude really reminds me of Ranboo in my opinion which is great because i love the timing of each joke or hidden puns, etc. Theyre so funny (I'm cringe ik, I love them both lol)
A whole new meaning to "Walk the plank!"
This feels like skipping the Skyrim intro
i wonder how big his boat is now
This game reminds me of the old game called Myst.
That pop sound is seriously the most satisfying thing
I'm glad this was my intro to the channel
He must have some really strong suck tape to build foundation like that
I was hoping you would notice the snowmobiles
You missed a pretty fun vehicle in the ice
29:06 it's so funny to hear him break character
I love this guy
My brother cant take a joke
oh my this is way too hilarious!
That was 19
this is what i do in raft
When Josh says he has an idea... you know it's gonna be good. His PC might be sobbing, but you will be entertained for sure.
Can you tame sharks?
Josh: Give me a minute... Me: Oh no.... 9 hours later...
Lets destroy the universe with an inductor. After some point of criticality, current through a powerful enough inductor can vibrate gaseous cores to create light powerful enough to create matter that can then be fused by magnetic forces of other included inductors. Let it run, create the very matter of the battery which charges it, and matter of the inductor to be added to it, and then the copper which is the circuit. The larger it is, the more mass, the more for a black hole which infinitely grows. Wala! space time might eventually rip and if not, mass becomes infinite, and singulation absolute. We have reversed entropy, and reset the universe.
Dude just unintentionally created a new speed running tactic
Ah yes the tornado of coolness
josh: *literally hits tala in the shoulder with an axe* tala: "A friendly face!"
Josh, how much Adderall do you take on a daily basis? Because you're either taking too much Adderall or you need to be taking more, I'm not sure which lmao
Josh in a nutshell:  "This gives me an idea. Give me a few minutes."  9 hours later...
perfect speedrunning.
ultimate floor is lava player
This video was very entertaining. Like wow.
GG!
I'm beginning to see why most games have strict limits on how much of specific items you can use.
Best 32 minutes of my life
Clip through things. *pop* "Aahh..." Lol
YES! IT'S OUT!
What the john
The ULTIMATE raft speedrun
happy week when josh posts!
josh what is with you and massive game crashing swirly structures
This could not have ended any more perfectly
HOW MUCH WOOD DO YOU HAVE billion
Imagine having such a superpower with boards irl hahha
I love how a shitpost suddenly became an actual strategy
You hacked it and got all the items. The most amazing part is non-existent.
This is the best channel on YT in my opinion, all the content here is extremely funny and makes me laugh. I could’ve just lost my dog, in these videos would bring me back up again. That was obviously an exaggeration, if I lost my dog I would be devastated, but still this is the best YouTube channel on the platform. Thanks for all the amazing content. :)
I remember playing the alpha of this game 💀  It was another game
Wow fortnite
This is funny as hell.
Imagine you're just sitting in Utopia and this monstrosity of a raft looms in from the distance, and on it a madman that says he is basically god because he can somehow break the laws of physics. You believe him of course because of the abomination that he rode in upon.
They should rename this game “World Of Walk-Raft”
ADD
LGIO and GSP should do a collab ngl
It's amazing how much this game sucks but how entertaining you make it seem.  Edit: This game really really sucks god damn!
I'm not sure why I did this. But as soon as he said "hey there its josh we-" I began repeatedly skipping 10 seconds back so hed keep introducing himself and getting cut off...
ned flanders
At this point Josh is speedrunning Raft in the most inconvenient way. Also who doesn’t love lights? It wouldn’t be a Let’s Game It Out video without lights and nightmares of the best. (Very Cool)
honestly the glitches in raft should be a feature at this point. keep it up devs.
tthis is the perfect video
Bro😂😂😂😂
So much of your humor and mannerisms  remind me of Jon Lajoie and I'm here for it.
Hi How did you have the patience to brute force the 4-digit code And build a bridge that's like 3 miles long
This man is the Maple of real life.
Speedruining a game
wtf ashfjkasdkasfdasd
Truth be told his string light tree was actually really pretty
Bro named his parents 💀💀
Bro grades his teachers 💀💀
@OOHAMI tgk ni
Bro gave "break the game" a new definition 💀💀
Vegetarian, Vasagatan looool!
He comes into these worlds and says screw you to God and begins to break reality itself to convince himself, sounds legit
24:14 man hit the floor so hard the filter changed
You have Planks to build up BUT fortnite sweats have walls
Ah yes! Mangoes, the fruit given by palm trees!
Best Video I have ever seen!
Have you ever did a video with  graystillplays
More raft = alot of computer suffering
More raft and suffering
This game makes no fcking sense
25:28 this is how I solved the puzzles in resident evil 2 remake
welcome to "Is there a limit?" on today's episode we try and figure out *"Can you beat Raft without leaving the Raft?"*
"You sure can?" or "You sure can't?"
Is it just me or his voice sounds like brimstone from valorant .___.
“Now that we’ve sequence broke everything”  A standard on this channel haha
Nightmare 🌚
I love the fact that this man find every other wrong way to  get access to a location.....we don't need bombs all we need is glitches and dreams lol love this channel
Entire game Raft in 32 minutes
17:19 LOL 17:20
Hahahaha nice
Every video i watch makes me laugh, just this is hilarious.
This guy must be from Florida.
So as developer you have two choice, first fix the bug associated with that plank without more pay or the second one leave it there and enjoy your vacation 🤣
I watched you 3 years ago, it’s good to see you again, I remember all those zip lines still 😆 all the good memories… in one channel…
This man is litterly graystillplays
Always so happy when you drop a video man!
Thanks for the laughter! This was great!! You have a new subscriber.
I love your channel so much,
The hurricane raft can survive anything
Would love to see you come break some Sandbox games!
bro my name is josh to
I love this
No one gonna talk about how he actually guessed the passcode?
i dont know when the last time was i lost as many braincells as i did when watching this absolute masterpiece
i though play two campus game whatever is name lol
welp RIP detail plank
Just like the ice super hero but with wood :) very entertaining thank you :)
:D
u definitely broke the game. hope the devs relise this. but great vid loved every min.
bro deforested the world's population of trees just to build multiple highways
This is definitely graystillplays
Even reality
I look away for not even a minute and he makes a huge wooden tornado
Dude this man is like defying gravity and ignoring physics
once again words of wisdom “yur fine”
amazing
u should be friends with graystillplays
Raft three: the return of grace
I dont think you realise but when he talks about his army hes refering to all his clones
If this item is just for decorations then devs can fix this very simply. Just make this item non-collidable type so that way no one could stand on it. Very easy fix and doesn't require to remove stuff from the game.
yes but where did you get all that wood
Xd
I love this man's videos.
How the hell and practice did you master hacking games so easily. "Few hours and days laters" Nevermind
What if Kitty Pryde was Groot
I love how your job is to make us miserable and hate the videos
I've subscribed to you over 5 times now  I will do it again
When you get to close for them they want to help us...
Wait you didn’t try to see how deep the ocean is?
This reminds me of dog pervert cancer truck
Finally, a new Raft video
This is pure insanity.. what did I just watch?!
Bravo , lol the ending killed me
Or when he does a sudden jump cut after placeing acouple of things
#2 on trending
He's just completely ruining this game 🤣
I’m really annoyed at the fact that this man never made a spear 😑
Nice
Every time you clipped thru a door, I couldn't help but hear "Lockpicking Lawyer here..."
The time he has to waste to farm all those planks even...with only 4 main frames....
Hahahaha I love what you do keep it up
I’ve never found myself hoping that someone was using some hack for infinite wood
Game Devs fear this man
The prophocy has come true, the Switzerland Raft.
your voice brought my depression back :(
This video was recommended to me and it is absolute insanity, love it.
So as I’m watching your video I’m checking out the steam page, and I notice on the Satisfactory page they have a screen shot of your conveyer belt tornado in the middle of your factory of madness
Game breaking? Physics destruction? Complete disregard for the laws of the universe? Sure, why not.
5.8m views in 3days.... wow
Yet another disaster by josh
This was hilarious to watch. 😆 🤣
Been waiting a while for this next Raft video! Wondering how he's gonna break the game this time!!
Where were you, when they built the raft to heaven?
that Peter Pan ref.....miiiint
magnificent
one thing that irritates me. and that's if you let the shark destroy your raft fully. there is NO way to build a new raft. you are forced to delete your save (if it auto saved) and start a new game
I can practically feel the developers crying
Josh reminds me of a less insane Greystillplays
The person who made this game was probably like: Minecraft is way too simple...let's change that.
Josh when shark destroys his storage tower: am I a joke to you?
american spiffing brit
this is one of the funniest videos ive seen in a while, amazing work
ok... Your raft video is better than mine 🤣
This is why we need him to play subnautica.
Very entertaining,  don't stop doing you!
Can you put a live chat it would be great to see people's reactions.
That raft is literally I AM THE STORM THAT IS APPROACHING
Josh finding out day 1 speedrun tactics
🌎☄️💥😈😂🤣☠️☠️
Play BTD6 (day4)
SatisFactory - Conveyor Tornado Belt Raft - Tornado Raft  What's Next? xD
17:32
I love that an Bucket full of rocks can just be upside down 👀😂
The All Mighty Detail Plank The Hidden Skeleton key what a game.
such a quality vid
Surely this could be submitted for a speedrunning record of some kind
I. Do not. Understand. Your patience. I’m speechless
I can't believe that he has this much time
Another quality video 🤣 Keep it up Josh 👍🏻
They could patch that trick by making those detail plank boards require some wood even if not nearly the same amount... and it still allows someone to do exactly what you did if they have alot of planks
🤣🤣🤣🤣dont ever stop bro!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
"how did u even do it" "Oh.."
love how he literally skipped all the content and made his own content
I am reminded yet again why this channel f***ing rocks hardcore.
this is why physics engines are required for some games
I felt physically sick watching this. good job I guess
Please do more sims videos!
I hope this never gets patched out lmao
all the pain, all the struggle, the grinding i went through, why are we still here, only to suffer 😂😂😂😂😂
Holy crap this guy is annoying.
ezez
Love all your videos ;)
This is fake. For one, he got metal and vine goo with out a smelter in sight. Also, when he went to the trading post, he shows himself getting to rep. level three in one go. That's not possible on  one island. But you may say "what if he left?" On his way back from the island and onto the boat, it looks the EXACT same. Not to mention the amount of wood it would take to make all those decoration planks. Also for ONE trash cube it takes a ton of resources to make one he (somehow) managed to make over FOUR stacks of them. Also, the recycler takes batteries, so we're talking frequent island runs to get copper.
Seas the day
This is actually the best way to finish this gams
40th on trending !
Bro really mixed raft with fortnite
7:36 Tries to chop the girl's neck  "Hey! a friendly face!"
Olof Hath Duped and hath nuked thee town!!!
I don't know why YT showed me this video, but I'm glad I watched
You should play stray it's a lot of fun and it's cool and put this next time when you play raft please make a normal raft
The only thing you ever need; A d j u s t a b l e P l a n k s
26:22 "Oh god, do I need to care???" I relate to this lol
This is my first video with this guy. I am immediately reminded of Greystillplay's game breaking BS. And I'm all for that! The main difference is the absolute nonchalant commentary just makes this that much funnier!
Wow this game sucks   You can break it this easy and hardly bother playing it   Thanks for showing me how to easily beat this game   It looks quite Boring after you beat it
idk why i watched this.. but it was funny i must say
EXACTLY HOW I PLAY GAMES/SIMS LOL          just beat on it like it owns ya money !
That was the best 32 mins of my life. First time viewer. Subscribing!
i think you broke the code for raft speedrunners
What is it with him and tornadoes lol, Satisfactory, the survival game, and now this lol
imagine making this on survival mode
I wonder if you had enough people and time, could you just cover the entire ocean with planks...
I knew today was going to be a good day
Ive never subbed so hard to a channel ever before
One of the most satisfying outcomes of a game brake.
Bugs in the game that is popular that have to do with planks and beating the game
This was hilarious 😂
...
No one can play games as wrong as josh
This man’s patience level is astronomical if he made over 5,960 guesses!
What can yo play this on ?
I love when people break games, and I especially love it when they make it fun
like
that code is my birth year 2011
Got a ad for "shehulk"  this is a joke no ? Lmao merica loses my respect everyday
That was beautiful
I think you need to brea- err play "Autonauts"
Pretty funny ending.
me when i see a new upload: oh no not this again
I genuinely think he actually put on those combinations for the brute force
Another day in a QA office, I see =)
It’s crazy how many hours he probably had to grind to make this happen. Besides the obvious 9 hours he spent making that glorious tornado. There are hours & hours behind this video; i love how he has an insane idea and just goes for it no matter how difficult it is. What a hero.
my man has to much time on his hands
Ah yes the speedrun classic "Walls are a suggestion"
I absolutely hate let's plays. Somehow I watched this whole thing
You are the storm that is approaching
10:00 my guy just bedwars bridged to the ship
Loved the video, had me cracking up :)
Superb
He turned raft onto Minecraft
He turned raft to Minecraft
he did it... again..
Josh: Genius of Organized Chaos.
Is he on some sort of creative mode or did he actually farm enough to build all those?
He's too good to walk on the ground normally
It's getting better
Since the planks are rigid relative to the raft, The game probably continues merging all the new planks with an existing, expanding composite model to reduce the number of 3D api calls.  Still, nicely done, devs.
I wanna know what MT everest would look like in this flooded world
Oops
omg raft!!! i've missed josh playing raft <33
You know what would be the perfect epilogue to this clip?  If the developers of this game sent Josh a plank of wood by FedEx, with a letter saying “since you managed to glitch our game that we worked so hard to develop, here’s your very own detailed plank to glitch the real world with.  Have fun!” And knowing Josh, *he would actually succeed.*
Raft, the ocean cleanup simulator. Prove me wrong.
It really does look like the game came pre-broken, good god.
your hilarious ...instant sub 😂🤣
Grace saw you made storage and said: is for me? 👉👈
This was the first video i have watched in this channel and i nearly choked 9 times of laughter watching it keep it up!
I wait patiently for videos from this guy.... and he never disappoints.
OMG I'm SO glad I found your channel‼️ This iz comedy GOLD‼️😂🤣👍🎉
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
is it just me or does he sound like ned flanders from simpsons also cba to spell
“Hmmm I don’t wanna use my legs” *proceeds to just walk on the planks instead of walking on the ground*
I was having a bad day until John released a video
187 7:08
why do i love these video so mutch?
finally
I think that one of the best quotes from this episode was:  "Oh god, do I need to care?"
31:21 You actually safed Lara Croft right there!
The saga is over. I had a lot of fun watching the raft videos
I rly like that whenever I see you posted new video, I smile.  And when I watch it, I laugh. Keep up the good job "!"
They should just straight up hire Josh to bug test games
Squidward squidward
i like your faceholes
Stranded Deep just released it's final version today after 7+ years. I've been looking at this Raft game for a bit but now - no need. Plus I'm sure I enjoyed this video way more than I would have jumping through all those hoops.
Josh once again went psychics who on another game lol
Vốn những bài hát ngày xưa đã rất hay rồi mà thêm giọng hát giàu cảm xúc của Phúc nữa thì đúng là cực phẩm cover😍
This is how I know we don't live in a simulation if we did , Josh would've been god or the devil.
He will always will figure out how to break the game lol
Pls do satisfactory explorer isn’t just for exploring anymore *me after riding into another explorer and going to heaven*
I haven’t commented on yt in a while but this dude is legit funny. I’ve never seen exploits like this in a while LMAO
Are you trying to make the game worthless
Yo I gotta get back on raft wow!
this game uses the newest version of the Dr Seuss physics engine
You NEED to play Jurassic world evolution
Lets get out our choosy finger
Josh is a prime example of malicious compliance. Oh you need the antenna to be higher up. Say no more. Then proceeds to build nightmare scaffolding
I laughed so hard my sides hurt.
15:22 the funny osu number wtf omg omg wysi
wow fortnite 2 is out. i have been waiting for years
The made the detail plank tier 3 because they knew what you do with it lol
Gaming
Oo
HAHAHAHAHA
Saw one of your videos for the first time (this one) and I am stunned you actually did break a code at 00:25:32 with just trying number after number instead of doing the puzzle - sub
can't believe how big this channel is now. I remember like 20k subs hahaha.  amazing video as expected
OMFG YOU'RE BAAAAAACK!!!!!!
When Josh collides the world of Satisfactory and Raft, we get this.
This series has made me want to play raft, but it has horribly tainted my idea of HOW to play raft lol.
Theory - Raft is not a game about the world flooding or something like that, the game developers were so tired of Josh breaking their games they dumped him in the middle of the ocean.
love the effort
Josh finds more bugs then the beta testers💀
Hi Josh
Bro built the wither storm
He just invented Fortnite
Forbidden Expresso. lol
Josh and his tornados
"Now that it look like a screen saver from 20 years ago"  That really got me  because i remember it😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Why do you like tornado’s so much
6:26 ngl that actually looks cool
Magnificent engineering
Well, that was interesting
If your timing is good enough, right before the shark bites you, look directly at the shark and press Space+S to dodge it. It will take you a while to get used to it, but once you have mastered the skill, it will be very useful when you are diving around the island mining materials.
I didn't know one could play a game so wrong.
cool
Your videos are so entertaining. Bravo! I wait for these videos to come out and I’m never disappointed. Thank You!
Mango does not grow on a palm. WTF
The only way to beat Josh is to start putting 6-digit combinations on safes. There.
Oh boy tis time for Lets Game It Out!
Petition for Josh to play Minecraft
play city skylines
He cheese the game so hard that it broke the multiverse
Hey a friendly face! "Let's not go that far" xD
Did raft game keep update??
also inf H2O
dec boards = clip hacks and skiping quests.
where can I buy this game ?
24:33
Enjoyed myself so much, thanks so much for taking the effort and make these videos. Never fails to make my day!
WHEN YOU SEE IT
I'm drunk. And this was funny.
7:29 CHARIOT WHAT DO YU MEAN CHARIOT
First
Ehy would you even trade stuff and such if you play sandbox
23:42 Won’t change the fact that he was looking dumb with his finger and his thumb in the shape of a L on his forehead.
0:38
The Only rezon im subbed is becouse of the reson u never take things seireously
You should make a lot more Raft videos like this lol. It was really funny
Should be a training video for game devs. Haha ;D
I can't help thinking that this is just a cursed speedrun
“Oh god do I need to care” 💀
you always know what to expect, something extraordinarily stupid
Wait this got number 1 on trending (gaming)
I had no idea raft had this in the game
It's so funny when the shark bit the raft and Josh was like  Oh no my raft stop stop🙄🙄
-Raft- Hashirama wood style simulator
I can only imagine what Josh would do if he played Subnautica oh the chaos
Josh buy game Josh play game  Josh destroy game Josh crash game
The way he breaks these games 😂😂 brilliant 👌🏻
Markiplier and LGO plays raft? That’s what I call a dream 💭
I love how the woman started screaming and you can hear it from far away while she's getting launched, Also thanks for spending so much time for our entertainment!
U
If I want to create pure cause I would highly recommend crackdown 3
that was fun !
the fact that the game didn’t even start lagging? wow-
Lmao, wasn't prepared for this! You made my day, sir.
Imagine playing multiplayer and having those weird planks everywhere...
Once you got detailed planks your like floors lava
In this video, Josh... -Builds a radar while taking a dump -Turns his raft into a giant funnel -Breathes underwater -Phases through walls -Kills a woman via drowning -Breaks the temporal continuum  Amazing.
akwoakowkaoa anjir
After 1 month
Never land refrence
Imagine playing with this guy and your trying to speedrun
I wonder are the places spawned in already or does finding or inputing the coordinates spawn them? It wont be any more game breaking to you Josh since you have the planks but could potentionally get yourself inside by spawning the islands on top of yourself?
Hey everyone it's heracane-it out :time stamp 12:32 in
Looks like the wither storm
i'm usually not into breaking games or playing them in ways that are unintended... but i can't help but love the wooden tornade and appreciate the efford put into making it 🤣
I love your vids man. But this is to far!!!!
Can we get a board count?
A problem? Let me solve it with some planks!
5 Million views in two days.. bruh
how to speedrun the game watch josh play it first before you tried to speedrun it
you did not sit and punch 5960 codes into the safe. and all these planks, no way would. you have fished them out of the ocean.                                      (ノಥ,_｣ಥ)ノ彡┻━┻ you got to tell me how many planks did you use
I haven't played Raft since forever. Now seeing that there's a story in the game kinda feels odd. Like it doesn't belong.
30:43 this is just epic
I want to see a LGIO style video on something from real life, like driving.  "Oh, let's see what happens if I drive through this park...OOOOPs THAT didn't work.  Let's try again."
day 1 of asking gameitout to do more valheim (i am in china so dis is illegal)
You are a wood plank Eldritcg monstrosity my dude, and I am living for the content.
Are you going to play slime rancher eventually?
This, is mans best friend: some overpowered boards
Side note: not once was this shark referred to by her proper name. No wonder she’s pissed
Josh never seems to dissappoint me. Love the video!
I wonder how many hours he has in raft now. I also wonder if he's played it properly for his own entertainment
Ive been waiting for a next vid for 1month......
Franky would be proud.
the bed play was astonishing work.
The way Josh broke the game in half without any hesitation is amazing.
Josh let me remind you of one person we all already miss Anthony
Hey josh pls play roblox if you can
Bro you broke the game so hard it didn’t know what was going on
I bet the developer cried all the way through the video lol
Replace a lot of ziplines. You look like Spider-Man.
i really hope the devs see this
now I want to know if you can end the game without moving your raft.
Watching the detail boards is like watching an old cartoon where they make a staircase with no foundation
Josh, When you say: "Oh it looks like a screen-saver!" PLEASE I BEG YOU don't add "From 20 years ago." It hurts haha.
The fact that he brute forces the passwords is the most impressive part of this video
Awesome video
this guy is making me so frustrated cuz i had to do everything normally!!!!
The ultimate pirate never stops walking the plane
I love how much time Josh puts time into his videos
Your raft videos are epic!
When you hear Josh say let me give the grand tour you know it will be good
Your Videos  AKE My  day
Wow I love ur content
best ending ever
the game is so fun just because you found a way to cheat everything, otherwise i guess would be pretty boring to me, nice video
yo josh it should be really funny if you can play at fireworks mania afunny videogame where you can destroy the city with...fireworks but with you it should be a better game
10:41 Vegatable Island?? 😂😂😂😂
I love pain. This video gives me pain. i love it!
I love how he never gets that angry, he just accepts it and makes a joke off of it.
Game breaker 3000
Best speedrun tactic.
He played
How do devs not hire you to test their games?
"my skeleton key" XD The Elder Scroll vibes
Other player work so hard while him gust ok
.
"If I can't use it or knock it over, then what's the point" - Josh
Raft developers : h-he just built a g-g-giant tornado… _f-for no reason…_ Satisfactory developers : first time?
Your so smart
i can only describe this vocal tone as ‘intrusive’
I love this channel, absolute comedy and gameplay unlike any I’ve seen before. I will watch every one of your videos and recommend you to my friends until they cave
One of your best yet! Hilarious
I watched the whole video lol and now when it ended is exactly 2:00 PM
Ahh yes. 5,2 mill views in 2 days
This is how you title and give a thumbnail.
The best part is that he never shows any game mercy
A true sandbox! I love games like this that make you imagination go wild.
Not gonna lie the part where you spend 9 hrs to make that tornado rly cracks me up. You're such an amazing game content creators lolz
11:50 Give me a few minutes 9 HOURS LATER boi that took me a while 😂😂😂
I really feel bad for this mans pc
So many references to other videos
Great video except for the absolutely  mind numbing American accents.
i love the commentary on this man. keep it up.
yoo he keeps destroying the game physics
What’s this game called
the sharks name is GRACE
Me: **Scared of the sharks in raft** Also me: **Wants to play it in VR**
seems legid!! I mean using the raft to get to places easier, without a hack I used too hahaha
wish I could live the real life just like how josh plays the games
13:40 you should've said "hop back aboard the boards"
The shark at 0:50 be like: "Let's wait until he finishes his talk."
“Thank you, thank you so much” as the shark removes a good 45 minutes of work in one bite is sadly humorous
Wow 5 million views in 2 days.  That's bonkers!
Came looking for copper and I found gold
I guess you didn't sleep for a week just to finish RAFT lmao

Greetings,  Disclaimer: This message is intended for those who choose it, everyone has free will or the freedom to make their own decisions.  A message from the Gospel in The Christian Holy Bible. This is the message of forgiveness of sin through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. In first Corinthians, chapter 15 verses 1 to 4, the apostle Paul states:  "Moreover brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I have preached unto you, by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you, first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures".  Romans chapter 3 verse 23, informs us,  "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord".   A sinner must recognise the despairing of her or his guilt before God in order for forgiveness to take effect.    Every believer must understand in order to inherit the kingdom of God as sons of the king, the reality of and foundational truth must be acknowledged, for all who approach the throne of God for salvation.   God promises us eternal life, for anybody who departs from sin through the saving faith in Jesus Christ.   Jesus lived a perfect and sinless life which no person could ever live. Jesus's sacrifice on the cross ultimately paid the debt we owe to God for our sin.   Sin against an infinite God requires an infinite sacrifice; and Jesus died a substitutionary death for the sinner.   In short, the works of Jesus paid the penalty of sin through an infinite sacrifice. Only the creator of life has the power to resurrect life after death and is essentially the proof of the power of God.   Jesus Christ offers his salvation as a free gift and may only be received by faith, despite any works or merit on our part.   The scripture in Romans inform us,   "If you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him form the dead, you will be saved".   In conclusion, the resurrection of Christ is to bring everlasting life and salvation to anybody who follows him. The relationship between God and man can be restored through Jesus's saving faith.
You're a wizard Harry
Your video is just so funny🤣
so relaxing hearing that monotonous bored commentary
Yes more raft
This ain't no tornado this flipping mind flayer at this point Give it some legs and a head and boom :
Raft still be my number one game in this channel,
Are you game developer because yuo no the bugs
Josh hit 4.45 Million subs!?!?!??!?!!?  I remember last year ago recommending him to my friends when he was at 300k.  Damn, well deserved growth
the craziest man in Youtube's history
All this time I knew about Raft, and I never knew AT ALL it had a questline, I just thought it was a seafaring survival game where you wander aimlessly and try to keep the shark away from your raft. Now I might actually give it a shot
this is the conveyor belt tower all over again
Waw I just discovered I played this game the wrong way all this time, thank you dude for your tuto, it'll surely help
I hope they never patch this
I completely forgot this channel exists, now i know it does again
Man just created the old windows screen saver.
THIS took ages to complete... The code for the safe could have been looked up but the plank tornado, the plank bridges etc. And the game itself basically didn't crash. Respect. Unexpected...
Speed run viable!
He's basically the Silver Surfer, but with planks.
i like seeing games being exploited, like what you do always and seeing what is out there, which was never meant to be seen by the players, speedrun mode
A vital technique for speedrunning: bedclipping.
Nice creative mode playthro
10/10 Made me reinstall Raft
"limits are designed to be broken"
Loved satisfactory tornado reference :D
Wow, your content is absolutely amazing as always. Shame it's not published more often. Keep it up!
Remember when he only had 1 mil subs
He's doing a speedrun
#1 on trending!!! well done :D
:)
I wanna see devs react to this
This video was the highlight of my day.
This is what Saul does when you don't call him
Grace is upset she was ignored, and not addressed by name!!
I love the little <plopp> sound, every time you clip through something, haha!
Josh you mother ****** GAME BREAKER
you must spend an insane amount of hours just for a single video thats pretty cool its no surprise your channel is so popular
Maybe I just didn't play in ages but there being people and stores on the islands? Wtf??
You don't get to pick any items. Nor you get resistance, or endurance. Plus, you don't enjoy the game.
HES BACK
singlehandedly created raft speed runs
TO MUCH WOODS
Thank you Josh. For making my day so much better.
How has he not gone insane yet??
He sounds like Cleveland
THE HELL ITS MY BDAY
OMG I will never be able to play the game the "right" way again. :P
Thanks for the laughs!
But still funny
This is pure stupid
He literally speed ran the game just trying to break it lmao
You miss the best part of the new chapter that is the snow car
5 in trending heck ye
Thanks, now I can remove Raft from my steam wishlist,  just watching you over 30min I've had my fill.
His videos do make me happy
i think josh has just found hacks to speedrun this game
I love this video
HAHHAAHAHHAH this is rlly funny hahahahahaahhahah
How fast do you think they will nerf the planks cuz of this
Raft but floor is lava kinda deal lol
Each time Josh says "give me a few minutes" the game engine ups its scream pitch
5m views in 2 days that’s CRAZY
Just as intended. lol.
This whole channel is basically a self fulfilling prophecy:  Do everything to spite ethics, science and logic.
I love how this isn't even clickbait.
I can't stop watching this, it looks interesting 😋😋😋
I'm flabergasted.
Incredible XD
Nicely done Sr.
I swear to god, i took a god damn laugh and the video have not started yet, i miss your voice josh
Do the enemy sharks know your part of the red cross , oh wait I don't think they have the knowledge for that .
He is so dedicated to not doing anything as intended
thanks, _grace_
Bruh this is amazing lol
6:06 me when playing a roblox parkour obby:
Omg it’s the wood god let’s game it out 14:44
I love your vids they are so fun and funny!
5:35 that’s help lol because it’s trapped
the best item in the game used by this guy
Amazing
God the amount of adderall he must do.
How does ur game not lag out with all those planks
You should play 7 Days to Die  I think that it'll be fun watching you break it
This was hilarious throughout the entire video! Well done, sir! ^^
*NORMALLY* I would not watch something like this.. its 1am, and I am bored.. so here I am..
15:23 WYSI
raft gaming? it's a resounding *_YES_* from yours truly I am a proud supporter of raft-based content, honk if you're rafting
I didn't know that the main character is a magician, or is it Josh alone?
I wonder if the devs will use his raft and place it on preview pages like how Satisfactory devs did to his conveyor tornado.
Your raft is now named "the eye of the storm" and you can't deny it
Who wouldn't be afraid like Olof after seeing a guy casually crouching and building his way through dimensions.
There's a chance that this magical plank will be removed from the game. I'm going to wait what will Josh do beyond that if it happens since he's Josh and he asks if there is a limit.
Tbis was fun
I love how Josh finishes the game with speed, precision, and grace.
Yea gotta be honest never heard of this game
Someone needs to hire Josh as a QA tester, only he has those impulsive thoughts that allow you to break games
6:02 Lol “a screensaver from 20 years ago”😂😂😂
Did you know sharks have a great sense of trolling?
Graystillsplay more like graystillplanks
:0 hes finally back
4:51 "research" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I love playing games and then coming to this channel to see how satan intended us to play it
Raft Developers made the ending like that for Josh only.
Josh tornado
watching this sky high is such a beautiful experience
The game is broken.
12:04 how nostalgic
I couldnt stop laughing at the leftover detail planks 😂 its just there
i just realized you posted on my birthday, best birthday persent ever
there is somthing about this guys voice that is just... perfectly funny
We all know Josh plays the games the way they were MEANT to be played. As usual, there is no limit.
Does anyone remember Grace
Game is not broken!! if game framerate is low, than colliders will work weird. Colliders are volumes that you put them in game map which is for put walls, ground ect. So if you dont collapse the player with colliders and if they can reach outside of theese bounds, they will think it is broken. Noo it is not broken. Map design is weak. if game is not opening, if there is many programming mistakes than you can say it it is broken. But this game is not broken. Just they need to put more colliders.
“Mom can we have hashirama?” “No we have hashirama at home” Hashirama at home:
Well that doesn't bring on the Satisfactory flashbacks or anything!
I fear his patience
my guy completely broke the game XD
another #1 trending lessgoo
Id have to rate his consistency as....Satisfactory
i want an npc perspective of this whole video
Next update you will be a wanted man in this game too !!! 🤣
It's crazy you already have 4.4M subs. Damn! When i first stumbled upon your videos you only had 26k subs back then. 😂
Bro beat the game with just walking on birds and skipped the game by 10 hours
This one man causes more destruction than f****** world war II how does he keep breaking games physics
Josh, I have a beautiful fantastic suggestion.      Goat Simulator 🐐
Do you record then add your voice on top or do you do it all in one go
No Yorkshire tea?
Do Timberborn next please. I said "do", not "crash" it, please take note.
I just love how it took you maybe 20 minutes to find 1 item that entirely breaks the game
0:50 I spat out my water from this
👍
When the shark ate the tower of chests, my body physically took 15 screenshots
Josh, you have broken your laugh record with this video. While I didn't laugh hysterically, I did laugh more than I can remember in any of your other vids. Thank you for the laughs. :]
This was half an hour? Felt like 10 min
what an awesome video. One of the ones that are well produced; i watched it the whole way through lol! keep it up.
This reached #1 on trending and that’s a good enough achievement
Thank you, this proves that you don’t need to over edit videos. I tried watching socks 24 chapter 3 video. But it’s so over edited that there’s an Animation every 10 seconds
Guys don’t spooked him he’s uploading regularly
The dude who voiced Squidward is really making money moves!
Its make me laugh so hard 🤣
OMG GRACE IS BACK
@Let's Game It Out .... You kinda sound like Squidward.
I don't think anything will beat your Cooking/Kitchen disaster videos (an absolute tour de force of comedy), but this was right up there in creativity, and determination to break the game in the cleverest and silliest way!
He basically just made that brick tool from Roblox that spawns bricks in front of you like stairs so you can fly around
Love this dude
he always manages to manipulate space and time
Josh is pure chaos, to a normal person
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.    !
i have two things two say one josh would be the best gametester and lets all thank josh for how long he spends makeing these epesods
Now I know why Josh takes so long to make videos.
Would be awesome if you can put lights on those planks
Lol😂
I feel like Josh is the kind of the person that developers want and don’t want at the same time.
I would just rage quit with that shark’s bite.
3 MINUTES in and you get what you deserve for being a psycopath
Yes
At this very moment in the video (14:47), I'm laughing so hard that I'm crying. I've never seen this game or even heard of it before I clicked on this video, but you sir..? You've got a new subscriber just from this. Thank you so much for the laughs. Lol! -Vic
It's, it's, it's over ITS OVER?!?!
I think the vortex of doom here is a little better than the one from Satisfactory. Mainly because the game can run it while looking at it.
grace is a victim of identity theft she's now just a regular shark
Wtf
from all i see with that wood is wealth. just pure wealth. mans living the dream of infinite wood of trillions XD
Nice clickbait ...
Shesh i remember the time he used zip lines good all days i was a og
more satis fatery  pls !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:49 If you see this in the Ocean... JUST. KEEP. SWIMMING!!! Me: NOPE! :(
how does he have so much wood?
I feel  like devs that make games like hydroneer and raft should hire josh as a play tester to see if these things they implement can result in stuff like this so that way they can prevent it although I feel like the agent of chaos that is Josh they'd probably cancel the game because of the fact they realize how much Josh can destroy the Game by just simply pushing things to their limits which if you're trying to make a game without limits can end up really coming to bite you
At the start of the video I was like "Oh, this is a cool trick, lets you build large structures and reach high places, seems neat. Not nearly game-breaking though, they probably won't patch it"  By the end, oh boy. This breaks every aspect of progression and is utterly hilarious
Planks are the answer to all life questions
Imagine seeing a plank-surfer go through your city
Amazing.
why didn't YouTube notify me for this
John 3:16 [16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.Romans 6:23 [23]For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.1 Corinthians 15:1-4 [1]Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; [2]By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. [3]For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; [4]And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:Acts 16:31 [31]And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
I am confident that Josh was a game QA tester before YouTube.. Insane glitch finding skills
i never expect anything less from Josh when it comes to breaking games XD
19 on trending 🤔
Fortnite
Man nocliped the game with one item.
holy crap detail boards are awesome/broken
I think let’s game it out would be good friends with graystillplays anyone agree?
memories of the giant cocoon in satisfactory
Thirty two minutes of Josh? I gotta ask, is there a limit to his madness?
Who needs a QA department when you have Josh?
Honestly didn’t know there was a plot/story behind Raft, my dumb pea brain just went “heehee hoohoo build little raft ! :) float in ocean !! :))”
Jesus Christ Saves  I love you guys, ALL of you. Please read!  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and accepting Him as your saviour.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
Whatching this in a power outage
Josh is the master of never doing it right. In most contexts that would be a bad thing but in the videogame world that is the highest form of compliment.
my new favourite sub genre of gaming videos
Average Let’s game it out fan adventure be like:
Betcha her name was grace
11:52 Me: Ah shi*, here we go again;
My favorite game to play with these videos is to watch the first five minutes and then the last ten minutes and just see how chaotic it got in between.
This guy literally has no life
Finally a new vid
His raft is powered by the forces of chaos
Ohhhhhh so that’s how you play raft
25:35 Celine Dion key???
basically silver surfer with wood
This video had me laughing alot. Very well done.
I’m sure if josh went to the backrooms, he would find a way to escape the backrooms using a toothbrush stuck to the floor and a fingernail he found off of someone who’s been ripped apart by an entity, all while singing the hokey pokey and drinking liquid pain.
Feel like so many game developers watch this just to see how many exploitative bugs there are lol they do be like: “the decorative planks… huh…. Write that down”
Alternate title raft in a nutshell
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Bruh 🤣
Yay new raft video from Josh, so how’s it been in Zion
I subbed so fast I laughed so hard at 4:15 to 4:45
Woahh
this game is broken
"give me a minute" 9 hours later
the fact the game didnt die is just crazy lol
At this point I cant tell if josh is using a mod menu or creative of some sorts or he just No lifes the game and breaks it in the process
Idk how you don’t get bored doing all these ridiculous things to make developers have mental breakdowns
Awesome Video
Josh saw the Infinite Planks and just INSTANTLY flashed back to Satisfactory, huh?? xD
This is definitely gonna be patched fast as hell
You should play theme park tycoon 2
perfect ad timing. video: 5,960+ tries later… ad: this is a cranberry
hi
This is everything that's right with gaming.
Play BTD (day3)
Play Subnautica
JOSH UR GREAT
As funny as always!
After watching this,i can testify that any man of god will call josh a heretic
Hold my raft, this isn't supposed to be watched on phone, this masterpiece should be watched on tv so that the whole family can see
He broke the game with planks lol
Im getting flashbacks to satisfactory
Josh is on a speedrun to become wanted in another game other than hydroneer
“Oh no do i have to care???” 😂😂😂
Your patience with the games you play is impeccable. Thank you for the entertainment.
Josh and RCE should do a race one day to see who can crash a game the fastest 😂
Random Radio Tower Woman: "Hey, look, a friendly face!" Josh: ".... lets not go that far."  lmfao <3
Alternative title: I cranked 90s in Raft!
How to hack a game without hacking it
if you sit down on a chair you'll pass through barriers.
hi
the box is new to me. Is it a barrel but with a different skin or does it have more things?
This is the worst thing you've ever done to a game before. You broke the entire thing, start to finish, in ways that would require SEVERAL patches to completely avoid. The devs definitely got drunk after watching this.
Do ya'll think he's ever in the middle of a 9 hour crazy process and just thinks, "Why am I doing this?"
Why does it sound like he’s on helium
That... Was beautiful.
Welcome a board the nightmare, Olof!
Raft has chapters? I didn't even know this game had a story.
wow this is like if YouTube was cable. Hate
Josh never called the shark grace 🤔  lol
I think I can see swastikas in the planks with ring lights 6:32
"Okay, so I made a *few* adjustments to my raft-" "You clipped through solid steel, defied physics with wooden planks, and made yourself immune to drowning by standing on a stick!" "They're only the *laws* of physics if I never get caught breaking them!"  -LGIO, probably
Honestly man I don’t know how you have the sanity to do stuff like this every time it’s honestly amazing
I love how he decides to make a tentacle of planks to get where he's going lol
"oh god, do I need to care?"
i wonder if he got a speedrunning record
you should try playing subnautica
Can't stand 99% of these kind of games but Raft seems happily silly.
I just realized he uploaded this on my birthday!! Thanks for the cool birthday present Josh!
What a way to send this game to the "finished" category by just making a absolute chaos and breaking the game at the same time.
1 on trending
Brings me back to satisfactory
This man loves pain
(News flash:)there is a tornado in a coral reef near us. We found a survivor from the famous banster yacht crash in the tornado. If seen please contact authorities immediately
lets game it outs dad hey son youeve been playing that video game for 10 YEARS!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Was her name not Grace?
I'm going to add a character to my DnD universe.  He's a slightly-apathetic, but largely insane being that pilots a strange wooden tornado around the cosmos, riding plank tendrils that extend from his craft and can infiltrate any place by  melting through walls.  He shows up on strange agendas of his own, unconcerned by the inhabitants of the worlds he invades, and their dumbstruck terror at his presence.
developers: theres only one way to do this cruise ship.  josh: not on my watch with 132 hours on it!
More than 30minutes of a new Joshvideo? Day safed!😁❤️
This is literally premium content for free
23:22 wild moan lmaooo
Game companies should hire him or at least give him a beta version ahead of time so he can break the game, so they can then fix it and release it
holy crap this is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
"Hey there it's josh, welcome back to Let's Game It Out" *top 10 most exciting sentences*
(falls from 69.420 million miles high) you're fiiiiiine edit: just now realized why he gets keys from devs. he always find glitches and bugs 4 them to fix (but hopefully not fix)
Now, that make scene, with the LGIO's DIY ways
Hello!!
Josh is Lockpick Master, but in videogames sphere
25:15 there is no way.
Why is there only one thumbs up button?? I need at least five!
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this guy glitch hunted for like a solid 600 hours before uploading this
Josh its ben 2 days, your mom said you were buying some milk... we miss you josh R.I.P
Josh! Your back I've been waiting for a new video it's been a Month
Thankfully, no trash to collect in the cleanest town - CHILLINGBOURNE.
The spiffing brit is another one of my favorite game exploiting professional. Traumatizing game devs and driving them insane.
Jesus this game is broken lol
i already have this game but i dont use it that much
yep this is saying frick you law of physics
The best joshes skill is so entertaining!
This is one of the best Let's Game It Out videos of all time!
I love how you didn't broke down the game this time with all your going around with planks, I swear the programmers will be watching this and think: "we gotta remove those planks fast". XD
Each second of your content is pure gold Josh.
next time you play raft you should just put a crap ton of sails until the game crashes
I always love to watch, Thanks
17:09  I'm having flashbacks to The Abyss. "Water snake monster/alien probe"  ( spoiler alert)
He broke the entire algorithm with just one video
When you have WAY too much free time.
day 1 of asking for new cooking sim video
is like a tree
20111 I was born there
I didn't know I could want to punch someones voice before
The best collab: Let’s Game It Out and GrayStillPlays!
I remember the first raft video like it was yesterday 😂😂
All a board
Dude why don’t people who are stranded on a island should just use plank’s
Oh boy let's get it on
Raft speed runs just got a lot more interesting :’)
the developers watching this: 😞😧😭💀
Every game this man plays he crashes😂
Guess I will have to finish my Raft game.
everybody: let's explore the new place Josh: plank
I love how incredibly unstable the raft looks at any given time
the thumbs up after each detail plank has me delirious w laughter omg
4.5 million views in only 2 days, unbelievably crazy
This seems a lot like fortnite
I have gurrenn lagann vibes looking at this base
Play game called RUST lol
u are the best
I'm sure the devs were not aware of the absolute chaos they made possible simply by adding a Plank
This video makes me want to start wasting extra plastics, in the hopes that more sharks will choke on it. 😂
Does anyone remember the sharks name?
Playing Stellaris nowadays. Your raft should be a Megastructure there.
ever since detail planks were added, they were my favourite item
Josh is like King Midas. Every game he touches turns to comedy gold....and occasionally eldritch horrors
Wow this looks like a really bad game. It was fun to see it broken, without spending a hundred hours of my own time doing it lol. The fact it didnt crash with all those boards floating around is a plus, I guess.
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo9ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 99999999999999
woah
What is with Josh and tornadoes?
6:33. Actually looks pretty cool
Whatever happened to calling the shark Grace?
"I didn't know I was dealing with a WIZARD!" *No-Clips Through Wall using wooden plank, breaking time and space*
Iam a youtuber please support me abdullah subhan
You shold play the "Dude, Stop" game I think it wold be wOnDeR fUl >:)
Boy do we love glitches and DETAIL PLANK XD
Y like when he made a tree looking  raft it actually looks good 👍
This was *chef's kiss* amazing!
Never wanted to play this game but damn you made me laugh soooo hard 🤣
Josh this isn't Satisfactory
Another raft video let’s go
This guy braim works differently hahahaa Good vieos, continu like that!
Damn I can only imagine the speedruns
Do a solo run of Cuphead josh
I fear the day that this man tries minecraft…
I am so happy when you release a new video. my face hurts
wheres grace in the comment section
play the game called the cylinder
Yay time with grace the shark 😂
this man has to be one of the greatest gaming youtubers
The poor game did not deserve this
make a cocoon
Here is a man, who sounds like he hates is job, like a man working at a convenient store with mild enthusiasm. Just saying lolol😏😏😏
It is amazing how well Josh can just..  work a game over.  The total effort Josh puts in is unmeasurable.
Josh's raft is bringing me back to the Satisfactory Funnel. I love it! 😂
This may very well be Josh's magnum opus.
Good thing the water rooms don't exist
WHOA, careful there Josh! Those lights are actually looking pretty sick 👍
Josh,  you should play wreckfest
Utopia looks like ridia from ratchet and Clank
This guy is definitely a Minecraft player, he spends HOURS building things that usually have little to no use, but he also breaks games to nightmarish extents
Super impressed with the FPS with the tornado 😂
It’s good to see  gray brake a game again
Never played raft, but this walkthrough definitely will help out in future pursuits. :D
24:30  it’s…beautiful
from witch country
2:56 is so funnyyyy
from where are you Let's Game It Out
A + + +, pure chaos gremlin genius.  You did a wonderful job, as always.
I played this game for like 20 hours and never built the radar. Had no idea all this was in the game. Did you use a code of some kind to get the materials or is there a ton of grinding not shown in this video?
Holy crap I've been tryna find you for hours, i finally found my childhood memories:')
تينقتيقلاء نبمصءذثنؤ 😀😊🤗
The developers: There are many bugs in the game Josh: you mean features ?
Finally, a shark name Grace appear once again!!
You should play my summer car
That was the perfect ending to a perfect playthrough. This may be your finest work yet!
how do you possibly have so many planks jesus christ. My friends and I struggle with plank management
Josh has to make the tornado into a cocoon and put a nuclear factory on top
Awesome video Josh! We'll see you in another month
Just a recommendation for him if you are interested in a new goofy game you should get a vr and get h3vr
I've never played it and with your videos, I never have to, either!🤪
Josh is about to single-handedly make the developers remove an item aye
You are amazing man 👍👍👍
What's your real name
I’d hire josh as a bug tester
I’d hire josh as a big tester
Been waiting for the upload!!
always a good day when he uploads
Josh just one upped The Lockpicking Lawyer by literally going through the door with two locks.
Dont subscribe hes at 4.44M
this was amazing, I had so much fun!
The detail plank reminds me of the plank from Teardown
great update, have npc
R.I.P. Raft, murdered by Josh
I really wanna know how many hours he spent on this game lol.
Man that was absolutely crazy. Been playing the game for so long and just taking it easy and this dude just stomped through it. It made me feel whole for some reason, it was awesome. Keep it up Josh, absolutely freakingly awesome channel!
Lowkey liked it better when we were the only human left
Just wanted to remind you You've got 4.44 M subscribers   And you deserve it  Love ya
it's like oil rig
Ah yes, the first Let's game it out video without grace, the shark.
Always taking things to new heights
josh really don't respect the door's feellings
Josh you should play scrap mechanic it's made by the same people who made raft
At this point, I'm pretty sure Josh could put every bug-hunting industry out of business.
Nice👍
Hes 3 in trending
Yessss a new video
My friends and I ALSO exploited the hell out of those plank things, we have a tower to the heavens you need to balance on
Josh, the Breaker Breaker of games, pinnacle of dev annoyance, Crasher of PCs,  and destroyer of CPU and fps (with the crazy stuff he does)
6:01 Where did this raft come from?!
3:40 hes doing an unboxing video oh no pretty sure game devs sub to this guy just to find the next wierd thing they need to patch
OMG Josh, hahahaha
sad he missed the skowmobiles
3rd on trending
I haven't played the update yet, but after seeing this chaos, that needs to change tonight!
I’d say he’s using speed running techniques but there is no way this method isn’t several times longer than the regular method of playing this game.
I'm at the part where he uses the bed to get inside. That guy is such a genius.
Free bug testing

Jo rabeeca sa p r karta hai vo mujhe subscribe kra 👈
"Now when we can go to heaven/20:56" XD I couldn't breath I was laughing to hard.
the amount of dedication and time this man puts into his videos is amazing
You played the game very normal
I love this video
That man in the title screen has a look in his eyes that screams two things. “My name is Bartholomew” and “I have been traumatized and tortured beyond your comprehension. My entire existence is more sinful than your imagination will allow you to understand. I have been forced to create such vile structures that destroy the mind. End me.”
josh is the first person of the world who consume the most of wood mazonia is scared now !
Play a game called totally reliable delivery service it's wacky it's fun and has some glitches that you can do It's also a ragdoll game
When ever I hear “ Hey it’s josh welcome back to let’s game it out” I am so pumped for what kind of stupid crap he did this time
Please do satisfactory again
Josh coming in just in time to make my rough week a bit bearable. Thx Josh for your comedic very entertaining channel and all the many great videos!
I’m impressed that you never ran out of wood
One word to describe all of josh's videos: unorthodox.
Hey are you team seas
Josh Should Play Two Point Campus
Like tf out of this so he can see that pressure washer simulator is a game now. He joked about it years ago
T-thirty minute blessing?! I needed this
The amount of broken-ess he brought to this game is ABSURD.  Now the developer will question their own existence.
Your the best channel you distracted me from the pain of my fractured wrist for a while 😊  Edit: my wrist is completely healed and felling great!
Game: you need a key to open the door  Josh: i missed the part where that's my problem   Proceed to use planks*
Mystery Science Gamer 3000!
josh gotmno1
Josh: ' Why walking??' Also Josh: *proceeds to use legs* 🤦🏻‍♂️
Oh my goodness!!!! I remember I loved watching your Cooking Simulator and Baking Simulator videos (baking was first video of your I watched, still hilarious to this day 💕) Now that I can comment I just wanted to say you are hilarious and your content is amazing. You never fail to make me laugh. I’m glad this appeared in my recommend again.
Does Anthony like... you know... check in on how's everything going?              Am I making everyone sad reminding them of Anthony? If so I'm sorry.
The sky now reminds me of berserk with the blanks looking like the world tree
Who needs game testers when we have Josh...
GaaAAAD JAMIT AM I GLAD TO HEAR THE SILLY TONE OF VOICE IN THE MORNING!!!!
first time i saw josh video without sponsor .. i hope he not forget to put haha
He sure does like tornados
previous game was more fun
You can play raft in 3rd person view btw
The time he spends just to make a 3 sec joke is what hurts in these vids the most
When you use 100% of your 🧠
YOOO U GOT 5TH ON TRENDING LEZGO
Yo congrats on #3 on trending
*Bro really brute force that passcode.*
He break all the rules for our entertainment 👏
This is basically wooden version of frozone mixed with sonic frontiers when you play
I love this Content! ❤️
The ending is so perfect:  Happy people being thrown with dynamite.
I'm surprised to see that Josh just breezed past the (seemingly) infinite amount of gears you can place wherever you want.
this is the absolute chaos and insanity that i vibe with. 10/10. definitely subscribed to him.
Well you DID use the item for its' intended purpose.  You just customised the gameplay instead of the raft.
“Well let’s start building something” The game developers: “Here we go again..”
I would have never gotten around to playing the story of the game, this very quick summary really helps lmfao saves a buncha time
the "Selene Dion" stuff had me dying omg
I saw a raft thumbnail and clicked immediately bc I knew it would be josh
her names grace how could you forget 🙄
Wtf 1# trending
If youre quiet enough, you can still hear the devs biting their tongues in anger.
Anthony
I love how Olaf was meant to appear insane but his actions and emotions are completely normal and acceptable in the context of a man going at him through walls on a giant, constantly growing plank.
26:23 Bro, this line killed me!
I like how the "is there a limit" joke has been Josh's signature catchphrase.

There are two ways to find the bugs in your game: 1. Spend way too much time ironing out looking for glitches 2. Give Josh the key

With the amount of games Josh crashes, he needs to partner with the developers and have them record their reactions to watching Josh destroy their seemingly indestructible game in every possible way

Do you use cheats/trainers or do you really take your time and play it normal? Everything you do must take so much time 🤣
I’m sure the devs intended all these strats.
The real finger of god.
Yes josh is back. I've missed your insane antics
Game devs: “we have full proofed this game! There can’t be any bugs left to exploit!”  Josh: “hold my beer.”
This scares me i want to make a game but im scared josh is going to play it and break it or find some thing i didnt know about
Nothing big just skipping half of the game
Walkable hallway 👎🏼 His buildable plank over the walkable hallway 👍🏼
6:00 M.C. Escher Who?
HES BAAAACK
I clicked on this video so fast 💨 🤣
Hey Josh knock knock
Josh: "Let me give you the grand tour" somehow manages to divide by zero
This episode had to take days of gameplay to complete. PROPS JOSH, always pushing the limit
25:20 this lunatic has way too much patience.
I make respectful and detailed true crime documentaries 🖤🙏
These vids light up my day
29:3 He had the true joy ;’)
you should break scrap mechanic
NUMBER 1!
Who wants a GRAY STILL PLAYS. And LET’S GAME IT OUT.
The amount of hours you put in is incredible!!! I love your videos!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
Man is the definition of worth the wait
BRO THE BEST RAFT EVER
Dev: To clear the game, you need to clear puzzle and fight creature Josh: Puzzle?!
Eyyy Josh made it on #3 trending spot for gaming!
Its pretty impressive how well the game handles all of the boards, was expecting the fps to be nonexistent by the end of the video
Also Varuna Point isn't the last chapter, but it is your 1st boss fight
Did he ever run out of planks?? Ahah
Using the boards is surprising much more efficient.
The real definition of work smart not hard.
You should be a Game tester... Game devs be like: WHAT KIND OF BLACK MAGIC IS THIS?!?!
Only Josh would turn a Detail Plank into a masterpiece. (can't wait to see IamKibitz freak out over this like he did with the Satisfactory video XD )
bro's on nr1 trending  congratulations
Why does inside your tornado look like the creature that i made
You need a podcast called"Let's talk it out" where you just talk about random things
Surrender to Jesus he is coming soon
You should do cities skylines
Other people: I built a floating house on water  Josh: lmao normies anyway I built a machine of death.
How did this get #1 on trending? Props to josh.
hello, I'm from Indonesia. I have a video game that is going viral in Indonesia. who want to see, don't forget to stop by my house 🙏🙏🙏
GOD DAMN THEY ON #1 ON TRENDING
It hit number 1 well done
Another gold episode!! Cant get enough of these🤩
bruh
I know there's a low chance for you to notice this, but can you please play Night of the Dead in steam? I promise it will suit you well and you won't regret it.
Josh try creating nightmarish creation on online multiplayer games to terrorize the players of said games
When he said I didn’t know we were dealing with a  wizard I was laughing
every time you play a game i played, i get an idea of how long your videos take, as even with endgame stuff in this game, most of this would take hours.  Of course the times you indicate a time skip it is obvious, but there is so much time that you dont indicate. this stuff would take hours even if you would cheat it, and i dont think you do that
Everytime he goes into the ocean and there's just endless dark blue all around, I get the most awful anxiety ....
Pov: You are too big brain
Iam YouTuber  please
I’m just glad that I was able to predict what was going to happen once I saw him look at the keypad
1st on trending!
Welp i guess it's bye bye to detailed plank Nice knowing ya
13:32 nobody:  the raft: now everybody from the 313, put your motherf** hands up and follow me
I'm sorry what #1 on trending GG
Game devs: Nooooo, this is not how you play the game  *Josh: Haha, detail plank go brrr*
If u wanna be saved today read this. The Bible says we are saved by believing in the Gospel by realising we are sinners Romans 3:23 and hell is the result of our sins Romans 6:23. And to go to heaven we need to be perfect revelation 21:27. But God says we can't earn our salvation because we aren't perfect but we can be saved through the blood of Jesus alone Ephesians 2 8 9 so we  have it by Grace.  we simply believe on Jesus Christ's   death burial and resurrection saved us. 2Corinthians 5:21 and 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. And it's only by believing John 3:16, John 6:47. And from This we know Jesus alone saved us from our sins  not by our works as Ephesians shows but by Grace through Faith in Him. And we can know we are saved through 1John 5:12-13. Have a good day.
you are more efficient than team seas
Just how much planks does Josh collected for making this video? He doesn't even use nets in his raft, right?
4.4m in 1 day Let's go
This man needs to stop touching games and give his pc a vacation
-8:07 jules
Just the thought of how many hours that this man did to put all those efforts. Damn this is madness
#1 on Trending? DAMNNN
Genuinely impressed with Raft not lagging or crashing despite Josh's tomfoolery and sequence-breaking. Props to the Dev team, they may have to remove the detail plank, but it showed just how stable their game is when abused by madlad Josh.
Ahh perfect 👍🏻
Hold on! Im subbed and Youtube didn't show me that you uploaded three times?!  Brb, I need to end Youtube-
The devs surly have notifications enabled so every time he uploads they know what to fix!
I can imagine how when you're stranded in the ocean and get bitten by a shark, you will just unhurtedly scream "aaaaahhh"
Josh I’ve been depressed for a long time until I started watching you
IT’s always so much fun to see you brake game physics 😂👍
You know ever time he play games it chaos time.
I'm not a gamer at all, but love this channel.
What happens when a pyschopath builds a raft:
Nice video
I am YouTuber 😊😊😊 I have a channel for girls poses 😍😍 my channel can help you 🤗🤗
No need for 🔑 🤣🤣🤣
You should play RANCH SIM, I would love to see you find exploits to earn millions of dollars 😂
The developers be like. thanks for helping us find bugs in the game
I think you broke it to its limits. there is nothing left to break
Devs: 😳
The end is epic, I was laughing in tears 😂
6:26 this is the first thing josh made that wasnt a disaster
The best part is that in some points it would've been easier to just walk but he REFUSES to play the game thE iNTeNDeD wAy.
Impressiv
Congrats on trending!
lol
This is so broken xD
Bro #1 On Trending?! Congrats!
6:30 I'm reminded of the movie Tangled in the best way lol
Great your the bug giver to the devs and they are gonna fix this in a min right now
How much wood you have
I think expecting people to remember aforementioned screen saver in kinda a pipe dream...
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life 14
I've been watching Josh for a couple years now and I just wanted to take a minute to appreciate how much time and effort he's been putting into his videos for years. Thank you so much!
“Oh god do I need to care?” Favorite line ever
you legit broke the game
The sharks Name is Grace
God I love these. You're how I know when to go back and play my favorite games.
Josh: Let me give you the grand tour The tour: NYC*
Weirdly enough, this is not the first gargantuan tornado monument Josh has built
So great to see josh succeed. Been with him since 2018
Play Two point campus Josh haha, just been released.
This guy is an absolute living catastrophe
4.1M views in just one day!
Bangladesh girl 🍿😫🤎😫😫💚😫💚🍿💚🍿💚😫😫💥😫💥😫💥😫
Josh is so good he does things we would like to do, but we don't have that much time
wood gives us god mode 😂😂😂
Oh Joshy, you never disappoint
the game creator: the worst thing is arrived a nightmare other: nani, the bug ? no hacking ? bad media ? the game creator: no worst than them......Let's Game It Out
4 million views in a day... Wow that's better than Beyonce.
Is raft the origin story of water world?😂
Didn't know they were still updating Hello Neighbor
Bros the physical embodiment of chaos.
can you tell me from where you get the zipline tool? If you are skiping everything???!!!!
am i the only one who thinks josh will mess up a game and somehow make it easier for him
He built a sharknado haha
Josh is the smartest, and the dumbest gamer. He always finds ways to exploit and break the game into oblivion. And somehow has alot of patience  Edit: aw :(. He used to be #1 on trending
Josh i love you
Man should play raft but mobile
26:26 Josh fr is complaining about having to play the game properly 🤣
Game devs should start paying Josh just to play their games bc he finds all the glitches lmao
Best gaming channel out there, thanks Josh 😊 🙏 👍 🙌 😀 👏
12:35 “…and we just got something. Ok Hurricane Josh is moving through the Atlantic Ocean going about 12 MPH spinning at about 30 MPH…”
Imma be honest the amount of excitement I get when I see a new video from you is insane love your work!!!0
Josh: 👉🦈
Every game you do your way gives me joy
WE HOPE YOU ENJOYED OUR VIDEO AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE USEFUL FOR YOUR LIFE.
can I see your face
Just like Satisfactory all over again Though it's missing the nuclear fumes
This looks like the greatest game never played.
thank you for making me laugh all through my lunch lol
He dies instantly from any shark bite but he's totally fine jumping of ten story high cliffs
U have to much free time
U have to much free time
At 2:55 I knew that would happen
Every time josh posts it’s like the second coming of Jesus … but josh
Classic.
I was in an 80's band called the prevention. We were better than the cure.
yay, grace :D   🦈
The detail plank was made for this channel
Genuinely sad he didnt call the shark grace
Watching josh make masterpieces like this never gets old 😂
That ending tho
Can’t imagine if he gave up on 5963, the determination is showing with that 4
LGIO needs to upload more
I love this. I have nothing else to say.
This 1# on trending in Australia
Nic
Devs: Hm yes our game had some unexpected bugs
Pov:you see another upload of this guy
the longer you watch this the longer you realize he is a psychopath for being able to grind for hours on end like this
“I guess we’ll have to do it the normal way” then tries to cheat “I guess we’ll have to do it the normal way” tries to cheat again “ I guess we’ll have to do it the old fashioned way”
Joshes computer must be crying right now
I’ve been watching this guy for four years and his voice never gets old
josh is basically justa devs bug notification
Woah u got #3 on trending! Congrats!🎉
a single day later... wait he in numbah one trendin!!?!??!
Do more planet zoo
oh man i love how he play game with Josh ways :L
There absolutely needs to be a new Speedrun category  inspired by Josh called the "Is There A Limit Run", that looks for the most convoluted and overinvolved way to sequence break a game
I love how Josh doesn’t care about civilization. Just leaves them to die alone, sadly. Josh: anyways lemme show you the raft tornado-
You could even mod Raft and break the game even further.
I think that the dev let josh play the game first so they can see if there's something wrong in the game cause Josh always found bug in a game
I Definitely love these longer videos
Always a nice day when there’s a new LGIO episode.
Josh is literally the human form of malware and exploits.
I would love to see a dev reaction video to these XD bet they love it
I like to think the raft devs designs this game specifically for you to break it
ayyy the game i recommended to him again less goo
Let’s game it out please upload More
So, does that mean Josh broke the record for longest and biggest raft ever?
I’m wondering what the npc’s would actually think if they were sentient. You just see Josh popping into places he shouldn’t be able to, npcs are definitely watching in horror
👆👍
Who's man is this
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.      !..
This guy is easily the best game tester.
How long does it take to type 5940 numbers manually....I want that video
For once he makes something cool 6:26
This channel makes me want to make games just to see what Josh can do to them... And I have no idea how to make a video game.
We need a follow with devs a kets game it ou
Pov: you're reading this comment
Man really used a Roblox path tool to beat the game.
"Now that it looks like a screensaver from 20 years ago." DYING.
Me : Mom, can I have planks ? Mom : why ? Me : I wanna breathe underwater  Mom : that’s ridiculous Me : trust me, ok ? Mom : How much do you want ? Me : *YES*
I love how much extra time he takes just to find the biggest bug in the game and beat it in that way
I see they broke where you fixed tangora in the past, so it was nice of them to fix it by giving you magical detail planks
Game with another wanted sign of josh
"is this game fun?
never ceases to amaze, as usual. Well done sir. may the abyssal planes of chaos flow thru you always (as it always does) Really wished you posted more of this chaos honestly....
I wonder why Gray isn't more popular, the guy is absolutely priceless :'V
true chaotic  progression 100
What is up near the
Whoever reads this message, I want to tell you are amazing, you are loved, you are worthy. Everything is temporary and you will come out of this hard time shining.
Josh why is the shark not called grace anymore?
Wow...a white guy imprisoned a bunch of "POC", which your character also is, and nuclear power ruined the earth?
AMAZING BROOOOO....😱🙌😱😁
when he bought the detail plank blueprint, he seemed to start playing the floor is lava, best video ever
For someone who likes to "see how far this'll go", kind of surprised ya didn't descend into the depths of the sea on your plank thing.
i remember subbing to you when you had 1m but now your at 4m! :D
This episode was so good I was actually looking forward to the ad. Which never happened 😥
“…Screen saver from 20 years ago..”
You know when Josh said give me a few minutes something is going to be bad
I’m commenting to try to get this to #1 on trending comment as like to join the #1 party
The word "impossible" is a foreign language for Josh. 🙃
Wow, your original String Light Raft looks like something out of the Main Street Electrical Parade. Y’know, if the MSEP was designed by an insane person. Therefore it’s cooler. XD
Ayyyy #28 in trending for gaming! Well deserved indeed.
look like the devs added a Teardown mechanic
This video is 3# trending
This reminds me of the meme where all the blocks fit in the square hole
Absolutely hilarious!!!👍😁😂🤣
Holy smidge I sure hope this guy is getting enough Return On Investment on his videos with how many hours of effort he puts into what turns into 32 minutes of worthy footage. Absolute mad(lad) scientist
Dear Josh, LUNCH TIME,                MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM?MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!MMMMMMMMMMMMMM?MMMMMMMMMMM
ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Huge investment opportunity?
this is the world record speedrun right here
I rly want to see a "Dev's react to Let's Game it Out" ... xD
Stoked you played the new update. Great vid!
thinking about now littering in the ocean isn't funny  littering on your raft though would be funny especially when we get to watch you rummage through it for what you need
verticality nah, boardicality
This is GOLD I LOVE THIS VIDEO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wondering status runway runway is brilliant g
He really just constructed a cogwell matrix
who needs keys
unlike a period josh is something you look forward to every month
this guy taking advantage of the glitches hahaha
just jump the shark
Its impressive how the game didn't crash or get low fps.
I almost thought of faking sick to leave work and watch this. THATS how much I f****** love this channel
I was awaiting Josh's Raft video. Mainly expecting him to shatter the game's spine in entirely new methods.
Grace!
The end is perfect
"Please let this be a normal playthrough" "WITH THE JOSH? NO WAY" "AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW" *skips 99% of the game using one item*
Hi I'm new
its like being the Silver Sufer.... but with wood
Yo josh just found a way to cut like A LOT OF TIME AND MINS for a speed run on raft holy
His titles are always something like this, “I” and then something destructive or horrific and then the game title at the end.
Number 3 on trending should be higher
There's a guy hurling dynamite at people in the center of town and nobody cares? That truly is utopia!
Josh should Speedrun crashing different games
Grace says that's just wood.
The stick tree thing looks good
i love watching this guy, amazing video
Where's Anthony
I’ve been waiting
i like the fact that josh do this things in 1 video and some youtubers do it in a month
honestly if raft was an online game, not like co-op stuff but kinda like sea of theives. with all the custumization posibilities it would be awsome.  P.S. sorry for the mispelling im too lazy to fix it.
gotta love degrading the world
Josh can find a way to noclip out of the backrooms
YOOO A FUL 30 MKNS???
few = 900,000
Frickin hilarious!
every time i watch Josh play i imagine him putting Anthony in a room playing for days without stopping while he is chilling and than just narrates it  (to the ones that don't know this was a duo let's play channel)
I love all the videos cause how much time spent on all the videos
When i watch another channels videos it feels like an hour, but when i watch these videos its like 10 minuts
#3 on trending????? Josh is major
OMG I just realized what channel I need in my life. "Game devs react to Let's game it out."
Raft? More like Plank.
I wish he would upload more who else agrees!
when he says "give me 5 mins" you know hes gonna take 9 hours.
this defies the law of physics
The only problem I have with this channel is the upload frequency lol. I feel like it's Christmas when I see he uploaded. 😀
32 mins??? it must be christmas
19:25 I can hear the screaming💀
When you legs don't work like they used to before
In every video hes just like "hello? Helooo"
Mmmm, yes, I love being able to become aquaman by standing on wood!
How does he manage to figure out a way to break every game he plays
This is why we love Josh, he always finds a way with his magic! He just never does it the intended way and does whatever he wants somehow still beats the game no matter how much time it takes
The way that Josh has played in this video opens up possibilities for a speedrun% where you don't touch anything except from the raft
Josh you have to do a Collab with GrayStillPlays
3.7M Views in one day ohh man 😂
bugs king 🤙🤙🤙
When i see a tornado, i know it is a good video
I think you took the saying walk the plank a bit to literally
"Hey. A friendly face!" Josh: "...yeah...friendly..."
Repent and believe in the Gospel of Jesus Christ before it's too late, God loves you!   For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;   Romans 3:23 KJV   But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.   Romans 5:8 KJV   For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   Romans 6:23 KJV   that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.   Romans 10:9 NKJV   For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   John 3:16 KJV     God loves you, Jesus loves you! Repent and believe in Jesus Christ today with a sincere heart in faith, and by the grace of God you will inherit the gift of eternal life! If you believe in Jesus you will NEVER die! (John 11:25) God bless you!
Someone sould speedrun raft with that tactic
Just subbed and looked at your videos to find something iv played or id like. Sorry man i gotta unfollow. Great video though.
Dude, y you not call shark grace?
What happend to Grace the Shark?
Great video. Normally i hate the commentary but your actually really funny. Perfectly edited. Il be following you and watching lots more of your videos
Time for us to dig in
Josh building bridges in this is like that SpongeBob episode where he is building flat planks mid air.
Time for raft
U sound like drea but squeakier😳are u his son
Build a ramp that leads to a nightmarish underwater raft with detail planks. (idfk how that works) your framerate is going to love it.
Ah- materials just don’t exist
Beat raft without touching the floor  m i s s i o n c o m p l e t e
What an incredible journey.
"Can you walk on the rug? You sure can't!" Yeah, I learned that from a certain... captain's nest.
Hold up….      Ain’t you Nathaniel b
dang #2 on trending nice
Congrats on #1 trending on gaming
You should've looted the rino shark. It gives you shark meat and a trophy
Josh re-created the 1986 film 'Labyrinth' with that boat construction
Why does this feel like your speedrunning
How do you make a whole city in the shark game
I love the fact that he actually took the time to go through every single pin to find the correct one instead of taking time to actually find it.
How long until all this is/was patched
I love how Josh puts SO MUCH time and effort into NOT playing games as intended.
Iknow
Whenever Josh says "all we need to do is wait" 1 of 2 scenarios pop into my head. 1, Josh sits there unblinking for hours waiting for the madness to finish. 2, Josh has like 15 computers in his room all running a different game that is currently in its "waiting" state. I don't know which one makes me laugh more.
sometimes I sit back and think to myself, "is the game JOSH proof?" usually the answer is no.
all the pain. How does it not hurt him? I play the game too and if that was my storage and the shark ate it, I would quit raft for 10 years... Also I sent you an email Let's game it out... There are trains in Astroneer now you better weaponize it
Josh might actually get a speedrun record for fastest completion of raft with the ammount of story he skipped by clipping through walls  Edit: what happened to grace :(
The construction site place reminds me the Leviathan manhwa..
Me seeing you phase through walls, "Yes, that seems logical"  Me seeing 2 of the same guy, "What?! That's not supposed to happen."
No need to have a LockPickingLawyer when you have your detailed planks!
Anyone realize it’s #1 on trending
You should Let´s Game It Out SuperAutoPets
I like how Josh traversed the islands the same way Iceman does. But with  planks.
I was about to comment on your last video that you should play Raft after the new update again, thrilled to see my wish came true by its own. Thanks for the quality content!
If there was a speedrun for breaking a video game josh would be the world record holder for as long as he lived
22:22 could have just clipped through the roof next to them lol
Josh do you have instagram?
💯💯💯💯💯
Hey Josh, i dont know if you are going to read this, but if you do I wanted to say thank you. I have trouble falling asleep since ever but when I watch your videos it calms me down and I dooze off :) I hope you’re doing great and I wish you the best. Stay as you are. ❤️
10:37 Vasagatan = Vegetarian  great english xd
I havent laughed this much since dear apocathery
Great work as always, Josh! Love your content.
You have number one on trending as of this comment being posted
I beg you upload more I love your vids
This is the most violent any percent run I’ve ever seen
You should release more often
Utter Insanity - literally lost for words
You and gray still plays need to make an alliance
I miss grace
What is wrong with you ?
What in hell is Josh's obsession with tornadoes... first Satisfactory now this?
Finally i get my screensaver back…  Thanks for reminding me to good old times!
Garbage
How dare you take number one from coryxkenshin
I swear Josh would be the best candidate for play-testing a game.
I laughed too hard
Oh no it’s hurricane josh
wow dat is sus EEEEEEEEEEEEE
Legit speedrun strat??
I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED he should've made the tornado as big as bear Island
Ayy congrats on #1 trending
After watching this, whoever invented that board is probably getting screamed at by their boss at ear splitting volume.
God I love this game
Man really tried every combination until he opened the safe.
You should play forager
Josh, it's not shark, it's grace
Hey! I hope you all are having a great/ night! Jesus loves you! God bless!!
I  was wondering 2hat he was gonna do the  tornadoe
How can you be so funny man.
Hey gosh could you try out guns up mobile or guns up PS4\steam
I love how Olof says stay back and stuff as Josh slowly inches closer. It's like Olof sees him as the god he is. The Lord of Planks.

speed broke his pc all the time and you are exited that you broke this game man nahhh
You are the best person that has ever played raft .my favorite thing to do in games is brute force it.
The *’You’re fine’* will never get old.
A 33 minute Let’s Game it Out video? Hell yeah!!!
No 1 !?!?!!
DO YOU LIKE FRENCH FRIES
I Love this guy Josh sometimes I think he is the nightmare
Best content in a bit
Weirdest spoilers in my life. I feel like it spoiled everything and nothing at the same time
GREAT 👍
Imagine if the game developers were watching and added even more items to help Josh destroy *the entire game*
I know it is nothing to this video bit you should play two point campus
y are really talent to f**k game congrads👏👏👏😂
Can you imagine the suffering the dev must be going through for all of the painstakingly long hours they put in to making the story line for the game only for it to be completely bypassed by a seemingly innocent item.
4:55 If only school was that easy..
Play Astroneer with the railway update

I love the fact that this guy always finds a way to break every game and takes all the meaning out of it it’s really funny
Wow, #1 on trending.  Congratulations Josh, well deserved.
He’s a man with a plan. He never makes a video without exquisite steps laid out by himself.
Loki calls himself the God of Mischief, but he secretly fears Josh
Am I only one who thought One Piece?
You should try out Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the switch, it would be be so fun!
Game developers: “How can I found glitches and bugs in my game? Oh, let me send it to Josh”.
This just makes me want to play Raft. The Devs have added so much content it's actually kind of crazy.
Hey, I have a recommendation, ARK survival, it’s a really fun game about beating up dinosaurs and taking all of the natural resources of the world 😁😁😁
Master bug finder
If this guy was in real life I'm pretty sure he's classed as a god
7:40 ish Npc: "Hey! A friendly face!" Josh: "lets not go that far."  My day continues to get better
Having played through the entire game 'the right way', I didn't knew I'd had this much fun seeing it done 'the wrong way'. Or is it the other way around? This was actually pretty fun to see ><
josh im  in love with you
When it was first starting out, I wasn't interested in Raft at all but seeing all this endgame content convinced me to give it a try.
@16:30.. the moment you realized you can plank underwater. Wasn't that the hint to change the raft, i mean tornado into a submarine
You could have stopped once you'd added the string lights and that would have done for me - it looked awesome!
HE'S BACK!!!!
Soooooooo great! 🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
I have come to the frugal conclusion that stupidity + unconventionality = HAHAHAHAHAAAHAHA. And I am 100% with it my guy.  Edit: also, the devs have to be aware that Josh would do this or else they wouldn't have added the swaying physics to the boards and how they are so top heavy causing them to move so much. They knew perfectly well and are purposely enabling him, and I LOVE IT.
12:38 shark jumpscare
Stop calling Grace the shark.
me thinking the alter motives of god naming me josh..
If josh made a video on your game you know you messed up something
For the first time, he didn't destroy his computer with his gameplay
9:15 behold a it's a giant sh*t/ship
Yes your back!!!
YO #1 ON TRENDING
hahahahahaha.. wtf 😂😂😂😂😂 the detailed plank is the legend 😂😂😂😂
#1 on trending?? nice man.
I'm usually someone who hates getting spoilers in a game, but Josh skips so much of it that I'm not worried.
detail plank was OP ---
this is like a speedrun, but different xD
Long live Grace
Josh found a new way to noclip into the backrooms
Fantastic. Josh always knows what to do with the one item very few people will use; make it the endgame "BFG" boss killer! Brilliant.
No ep??
He barely uploads but when he does its like its almost always on trending and this time he got 1# trending
Josh : 'Having fun Developers : 'Feeling literally *violated*
why is this trending?
You have an obsession with funnel shapes

Bro is #1 on trending 😂.   Congratulations
Ooh please walk to the bottom of the Ocean. What happens?
Without watching the video yet, my reaction to the thumbnail was thor’s reaction to thanos snapping.
Try to play roblox theme park tycon. I knowmu can really mess with a game!
Or maybe a sims video
Dude you are just awsome
incredible
I love how he roasts the whole entire game in the most casual voice possible
Did you forget the sharks name Grace
at 80:6 how did you know????
FINALLY some happines in my life
Anybody else remember when “Grace” was a whole thing that Josh would go to extra lengths to make miserable?
Grace the shark is back?
Leboobs James
Lets hope the devs dont see this one
Imagine you anchor a raft sonewhere andbuild a bridge out of those detailed planks to each big, story island😅
Grace?
Just thinking about how much time Josh spend on making his videos.
Whata journey
Haha
new speedrun glitch
My man just speedrun the game with one item
We need more videos please
I'm amazed this is #1 on trending! Just wow! WAY TO GO MY DUDE!
Detail Plank is awesome xDD it really f**ked my ship when i found out u can do infinite paths with those :D  EDIT u screwed the end place like i did xDDDD
I have a complaint… u don’t post enough 😔
lol yesterday i finally finished raft and you thought exactly this day would be the one xD
I think Josh just accidentally made a new speedrun tactic
Congrats on number one on trending!
You should play slime rancher
6:29 not gonna lie the raft with all the string lights on it does actually look quite pretty
The power of plank😂😂😂😂😭

you are my favorite youtuber hands down
Hey number 1 on trending, cool
Wait a minut. Palmtree, Palm Leaves, and then the freking tree gives you mangos ? I am no expert, but I dont think that is how it works.
Lets Game It Out becomes Lock Picking Lawyer with the use of plank
I don't know how I found Josh's channel but I'm very grateful I have, his videos are cure for my stress, for real! I wish I had his brilliance so I could destroy games like he does LMAO
You need to team up with the spiffing brit sometimes.
I think it’s not that josh has insane patience to do this but that he throughly enjoys breaking games in every possible way
20:40 cats be like
Now that's a way to make any day a good day
your videos have always lightened up my mood no matter how down in the dumbs i've been, thank you for being the most out of pocket and unny youtuber i know

This was one of my favorites lmao what a banger.
Put lights on the tornado
i love everything about this xD
I love your content man I'm a big fan
I think you should speedrun this game
NO.1 trending pog
Josh this is number 1 on trending *what did you do*
The way you can break a game is absurdly beautiful.  You made a raft into an eldritch horror, and yourself into a wooden counterpart of the Silver Surfer. You even created an alternate ending... *_slow clap start_*
Your videos are the the only ones that I watch fully without skipping anything.. That says allot from someone with adhd lol
#1 on trending 💪💪💪
completely random but i would like to thank you, i just went through a rlly bad breakup and have been numb ever since but i finally was able to cry but then i couldnt stop so i put on this video to distract me and it helped a lot<3
It this channel safe for a 7 year old just asking
I absolute love the idea that this method of breaking the game could be a potential speed run strat - The Lets Game It Out Method Speed Run

I played a different game ! 🤣😂

Geek city.
how long did this take
Why is this 1# trending? The video is so slow and lame, definitely Youtube rigging the system /:
I feel like every game tries to fix every bug so Let’s Game It out doesn’t try to speedrun it
that's 1 hell of a speed run lmfao, amazing as always, Josh.
The guy literally used game cheats to get all the wood he used! He used it through out the video and no one noticed? Infinite wood? Getting bulbs? Looking up the codes? Are we just going to ignore it all?
how the devs didn't see this coming?   i think it's your best raft video in terms of breaking stuff.
This video has unironically make me want to play “raft”
It’s so fun to see him spend 100s of hours on videos
i missed this sm
When a simple decoration piece was turned into a way to beat the game
Oh god no
I clicked this because of the thumbnail. My god
I have come to the conclusion that josh is not human.
Nobody cares about Joe Biden 😂
Josh, the master of destruction. I have so much fun to watch your videos or streams.
Yes, just yes!
I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news but it’s more obvious than you you think but you are clearly making a spaghetti monster to worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster
Most of the people's jobs:- *Engineer, doctor, employee, teacher, etc.*  Josh:- *I traumatize the developers*
Josh should be a bug tester, with the amount of bugs he finds
WOOOOHOOOOO
Josh basically speedrunning Raft with this exploit lol. I wonder if there's a Raft speedrun community and if Josh just unintentionally revolutionized their strats with this video, lol
If Josh can build a tornado, he will build a tornado.
my friend called himself  a plank man but this is another level
i love josh video

Amazing content!
Why does his boats look like a biblically accurate angel?
I wonder how far down the map goes if you anchored in the middle of the ocean?
im so impressed how this man is able to break every game he plays, like, this game is so good! Josh: hold my beer.
If you could have any superpower, what would you pick?   DETAIL PLANK

But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all.

I have lamented about the length of time that has to pass between the uploads by you Josh, but I now realize that the time spent editing and making your masterpieces is well worth it. I watch YouTube much less these days because you are not always on it. That said I am always so happy to see your new posts, get a huge laugh and enjoy your Genius!

Is it his graphics card or the amount of memory that allows him to make such monstrosities? I've seen other gamers with good rigs and they can't do half of the stuff he does.
Josh just skip most of the game with only a planks
My friends: I kissed my crush in a dream last night! My dreams:
Josh really be using that plank like Frozone uses his ice slides

How many bones have your carrier broken
Man, I thought you were dead
Congrats with getting #1 on trending!
Another masterpiece
What i learned from this video: Josh takes his hard wood with him everywhere.
6:26 that actually looked sick as hell
It’s sad that the other guy left, you are doing a good job with the channel Josh.
I always thought I was cool that he can push a game beond it's limets and skip have the game with a simple board. It took me the same time to complete half of the game as it took him to put up lights
Not used to snowflakes - Based Josh 2022
Josh doing what Putin thought he was going to do.
Best item
YES HES BACK WITH ANOTHER RAFT VIDEO
Josh Is A Menace In Every Game He Will Literally Figure Out Something That Will Make It Easier And Fun At The Same Time
Please play stardew valley lol
6:26 - surprisingly beautiful..?
Josh is just stealing the jobsof playtesters
Looks Like The Detail Planks Are Very OP.

OMG stop calling Grace "the shark"!
2.9 million views in 21 hours and #1 on trending. Congratulations on making it dude. Hard work well rewarded. Now bring Anthony back for a podcast interview. Pretty please
You should play astroneer again because they added trains
wow what a lovely video
*Josh has Joined the Chat*  FPS: *intense lagging*
I like Josh still mention about Grace the shark, even he doesn't call her name
The fact josh spends HOURS doing stuff that's boring just for content is something that anyone can rarely do since their lazy
That will be 99+ JIRA tickets for the dev team, lmao
23:23 sus sound
ThE TOrnADo iS nOT bIG EnOuGh
I'm pretty sure this is the most broken loop hole you've found out of any game yet
Your distinctiveness will be added... or whatever.
I feel like this man doesn't have feelings literally spending all of his time making this video not wait not just this every video I feel like his soul left his body too     edit: edit
other people make more than one vedio wow
How on earth did you get all the wood?
how many planks were used during this game, i wonder
This is the most fun game break i've seen in a while.
Amazing :D You never disappoint :D
this won’t be pinned with a decorative wood pin

Josh is the very definition of a parents nightmare  Wasting tons of time  But still funny and actually making money from it
"Pacifist run"
This is by far one of Josh's best breaks of a game. Even though nothing crashed, it basically made the entire game moot. Absolutely loved it!
★彡[ᴘʟᴇᴀꜱᴇ🙏 ꜱᴜʙꜱᴄʀɪʙᴇ ᴍʏ ᴄʜᴀɴɴᴇʟ]彡🤝💯💞
This game is so broken after so many years.
im sure the game creators hate you bro🤣
this sucks i wanna watch this so bad but i dont wanna get spoilers for the game.... i dont know what to doooooo!!!!
whenever you hear josh say give me a minute, u know oh noo the grand tour gonna start
Olof looks like he had enough with your insanity lmao xD
6:26  surprisingly enough, that actually looks quite pretty!
Let's go Top 10 trending
His laugh when the military guy disappeared xD
Let's go
genius! """
And here I wondered where was Josh for the past 1 month.... make sense...
How hes bilding in the sky lol😆😆😆
I laughed so hard when josh said "give me a few minutes" then proceeds to get a 9hr nightmare raft build lol
26:24 “Ugh do I need to care” and 28:20 “I’ll go get MY tools” sums up what all of his videos are and I love it XD
This video was a masterpiece, I enjoyed it very much 🤣
Making an structure that Stretch beyond any comprehension and breaking Space-Time.Josh is Eldritch God
I literally have no words to his dedication to play game in very right way , and even make games,vidios so much intersting.
👍
Satisfactory Fans: OH NO NOT AGAIN
You should make a massive board line and see how shaky it gets 👹
A video game company ran this game through multiple bug checks to make sure there weren't any and yet Josh managed to find about 300 in a day
"if I can't use it or knock it over then what's the point" - words of wisdom
hi bro good vid but you should try astroneer again they add trains in the game
if  time is a man probably time would run awayfrom josh
Imaging hire this guy as a glitch/bugs finder Developer team could take seriously long time to release the game
Some day I wish to have the same determination and patience when causing pain and suffering to the world around me that Josh has.
Cant wait to read the notes for the next patch
he made a new trick to speedrun it
Your dedication to your craft is admirable. Even if that craft is making fun of Raft.
You missed the dude in the glacial area he was in the room where you get the note you go in and look left
That's fun
The legend is finally ONLINE!
when josh says "let's have fun" oh you are about to see what happened you will be dead from laughing
#1 on trending holy
1 trending!
Your right Josh, you DID break the game. lol
"raftnite"
This is such a you thing to do 😂
You are amazing Josh! This was so entertaining! Also, I wonder what Monster pc this is running on?
Day 1 of asking for new video

you, are, great
who would've guessed that Celine Dion is radioactive
So your family was familynapped y
Oh my god Josh, #1 on trending
fastest raft speedrun i ever see ..
There are two ways to find the bugs in your game: 1. Spend way too much time ironing out looking for glitches 2. Give Josh the key
#1 on trending!! Awesome!
The fact that he spends hours playing games without passing out is just amazing but also concerning
I just watched like 20 videos of cartel torturing and killing ppl then I watched this
Dude you're #1 on trending! What the hell
I'm honestly surprised they're not paying you for play testing at this point, because I think you and you alone would've thought to yourself "decoration boards? More like cheat code to beat the game!"
Now we are a real Tornado XD help me
Joe
That shark there is grace 😤
This is just raft but the floor is lava
Ah safety Josh’s videos give me safety
awesome man love you so much but i havnt wacthed you in so long love it
Raft design inspired from satisfactory I see
Love me some of that anti clickbait. Title is an understatement, beautiful video.
Please do more planet zoo that series was funny
You got a dual 3090ti or something? How did that not crash?
I feel for those too young to understand the screensaver reference...
I don’t know if you take game suggestions but I feel like factorio would be a game that fits well with your videos
haha youve outdone yourself xDDD
@5:58 "a screensaver from 20 years ago". Uh, Josh, sorry to say but it's actually 30!
How long did the montage take? If I may know
Number 1 on trending!!!
Wild how people be spending their time
hey it’s josh from lockpickinglawyer
You shoulda got the woman out of the chair before you launched it
1# on trending in 20 hours insane
I just love when he posted the living glitches of the world🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i doubt you really tried more than 5000 codes in that lock.
He is actually insane :)
Would he was at the big bubble place and made the thing on the top explode and fly into the ocean, you could hear the woman in the chair scream
The game developers will regret adding that detailed plank
I really wanted this for so long

When a developer makes a game and the developers ask each other are you sure “lets game it out” doesn’t know about it? Are the bugs fixed 🥹
Try playing space flight simulator plz.
Pleasse game name and  how to play with phone

Josh is good, but the game that didn’t lag or crash after all that is even more impressive. Props to the devs.
[Sees a weird shape on YouTube Feed] "What a weird Thumbnail..." [Overlooks it and carries on about day and sees it again today] "Ok who made it... oh Let's Game It Out new content!"
THANK YOU MY GOD Finally another raft video
game developers be like, "uhh... you're not supposed to.... nevermind...." *sigh
Hey

Incredible
Where is Anthony
hello people 👋
Because of you josh they will patch the game !! xD

Hi
ah no I missed… I should jump into shark infested water to grab it
This was an amazing look at the game from behind the 4th wall. That ending with the infinite bombs in Utopia was truly perfect.
Ahh yes the variable planks. The greatest invention mankind has ever made
#1 ON TRENDING?!?!?! LETS FVCKEN GOOOOOOOO! im a big fan btw i love your work xD
oh boy, did i miss you!
As I expected from the destroyer of games himself
When I first started watching this dude I thought the "X hours later" were kind of a joke, now I know they aren't and I appreciate it SO MUCH
I just know the devs are so mad right now XD
Man doing speedrun tatctics at this point with hid planks
It's so nice that we live in the era of "I know the game is a terrible buggy mess but who needs to polish or finish it since we can just call it early access?"
If you have still got the receipt you will be able to get a refund or a replacement.
E
I’m very Talented and Hilarious to watch 🔥I do Reactions and Football and great Vlogs as well💯
thanks for the tutorial on the entire game
My favorite thing is imagining the raft devs sweating as they click on this video to see how he broke the game
Dev be like: Go step on grass. Josh be like: why i need to step on grass, when i can step on boards
Ah yes, thank you Josh for another video that will make me question my sanity
Josh making some speedrun tactics lmao
It always brings smile to my face when i see Let's game it out uploded new vid <3
I really wish the devs would react to this :D
no sponsor? ok...
Hey you should play two point campus
The game: Please I gave you all I have...
those boards are gonna be removed or replaced or fixed so make some saves with them unlocked
15:23 WYSI
You should put the lights onto the tornado. It would look marvelously in my opinion.
Such a Giant bowl
clickbait
No Grace?
Ayo #1 on trending good job!
Josh casually playing creative mode in survival
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, neglect, cruelty or starvation. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. None of us are righteous, perfect or good (any human who claims that is untruthful with you)  we have all sinned before God. Everyday we make mistakes and everyday we sin in word, thought, action and deed, but God loved us so much that he look past our frail human nature and our failures and loved us and wanted to save us anyway despite  the fact we could never be good or righteous on our own merit.  Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
* RAFT developers angry noises *  Josh: 26:23
Miniminter should react to this or someone

You always know once Josh says " I have a idea " that he's about to do something the completely breaks the laws of Physics
XDDD
another video after 60 years
waiting for this video for so long
Josh is 99,99% build master of nightmares 00,01% normal
Oh god I expected something but not this abomination
GRACE!!!
Question: If everyone on the cruise ship is dead. Where are the dead bodies? o
what a game
Number 1 Trending, let’s go
What happen to grace haha
hi
im here in 19 hours
I missed this.
This dude really wants every dev to ban him lmao
Anyone else notice this is number one on trending in the world He never fails to entertain us
You should try and break the game grounded.
Yay
bro’s playing fortnite in The Raft
The fact this is on treding though lol
the code was 2011 and thats the year i was born
Conventional Josh! You just broke the game again!
hte co
um oh lol
I kind of expected him to make a underwater living space with the plank.
Day 29382992 of asking josh to collab with gray
Selfishly I wished you came out with content more often because it's amazing. But I realize in order to do what you do...it takes for EVER lol. Quality over quantity. Definitely my favorite gamer to watch. This whole series is an accomplishment and thank you for that lol
Ive waited for this long and it was worth it
the shark that took me by surprise
I remember watching ur videos every single day during remote :DD
YES
I just Love it wenn he Brakes The             I just Love it wenn he Brakes the  game
You could put stairway to heaven for the building montages
*vietnam flashbacks to satisfactory belt-nado*
Im terrified of the possibility that Josh actually tried 5000+ codes just to not search out the code himself, truly a madman
I'm supposed to be doing some work training
If I was this game's dev, I'd be very stressed right now and considering just removing the planks :P
I like how he became a maniac after his buddy left
u hjould make more about valheim
how di u get vcine cod without the smelter at the start
Congrats on 1# trending!!!
“Good live, come laugh, who float sail” 😂
Oh Josh, the constant source of some of my most hideous nightmares.
wow, #1 on trending. Nice josh.
When you hear Josh say "gimme a minute" you know you will soon see a huge nightmare that took 9 hours to build
That end got me laughing
yes new video
Man, raft speedruns are about to get wild with this one item
This video is #1 on trending! I guess he found the limit to how high he can go in YouTube’s algorithm
Gg
it's been so long since I've seen this game...so seeing this was....Interasting to say the least   Not a huge fan of how many humans you see now in places that were previously designed to be abandoned, seems like every story related island has atleast one human
YOU DID RAAAAFTTT Nostalgia hitting me
I like how he casually found a great speedruning strat with the poles and clipping through things
Josh is so evil that I almost feel sorry for the game. Almost.
i name the shark...henry.
Imagine how much resources that took him
OMG YOUR JUICING JESUS!! 2.7 milli in 19 hours?
How come the character is black but his arm is white
I'm 99% sure that game devs have notifications on this channel so everytime Josh uploads they could see what they'd have to fix in their game
good to know that even the youtube algorithm knows that Josh creates great content, number one trending lets go, kinda sad the shark isn't grace anymore. rip grace
Congrats on becoming trending!
This is top speedran strategy
thanks
Love this guys comedy. Earned a new subscriber.
My boy Josh just discover a speedrun glitch by accident
U haven't posted for ages
Yo, a new video!!
developers:make an amazing update to raft,entertaining and full of chalenges   josh: planks go brrrrrrrrrr
I wonder, did he knew about rug glitch or that just went on the way :D
I swear that this is the one and only Chanel i don't skip
2.7 mil on one day. me is surprise.
You're game breaking skills are phenomenal... 🤣
congrats on no.1 trending
The game: Here is your route and mission. Josh: uhh, nope. I'm going this way
#1 on trending lessgoo
1 on trending been waiting for this so proud of josh for being so popular I remember when josh played with other people and was in my opinion great
Josh using the raft (detail plank) to clip though boundary to easily get the paper note. Speedruners *noted*
If graysillplays and let's game it out where todo a collaboration the  Is entire earthwood collapsed into a singularity
At this point I am convinced that Josh can even make chess entertaining.
This could literally be a speedrun tactic
Yours
Who won the best Youtubers ever
like destiny 2 bugs
If you can attach raft to those planks...couldnt you just go under water and build your raft down there? Removing upper parts afterwards, you got yourself submarine.
I love the nightmares you make
Cool, i bought this game for like $3 when it was in early access, finally time to play it lol
Are you ok?
Hell yeah #1 on trending
babel be like:
Imagine, you see someone standing on a plank approaching you in jojo pose💀
Whoa #1 on trending
Bro congrats #1 trending!!!
please play scrap mechanic survival
the best playthru ever!
Do you know what porcupines do when they meet
I'm starting to think that devs give letsgameitout a key so that he can find a glitch in 0.00001 seconds
when josh said 'Second star to the right and straight on 'til morning.' it made me remember when my parents used to read books to me at night... Thanks josh,  i forgot about that
Does this video tell us your lazy
One of the best game breaking video. Still has to do all the travel and guess where the story continues next, but doesn't have to solve the puzzle by just clipping through doors. Amazing.
Oh the poor raft developers
The dedication of this man to push the games to its limits
The legend is back!
Congrats on 1 on trending
HWLP I WAS AVOIDING THIS VIDEO BECAUSE I THOUGHT I ALREADY WATCHED IT. MY LETTUCE FELL ON MY SCREEN AND CLICKED THIS VIDEO THEN I SAW IT WAS 18 HOURS AGO
haha yez
Hi
FINALLY
Unfortunately he didn’t found the snow speeder. There are really funny
Other gamer need to find key and do puzzule   Josh: just cliping through wall and door just like His normal day
Joshhhhhh… they’re gunna patch it now!
Somehow for some reason i knew it was going to be a tornado 😂
daym hes breaking games. hahaha
josh the board physics breaker
0000… 0001… 0002… 0003… 0004… 0005- i cant do this im not that patient ;-;
2 Million Views Per Vid, Its because all the time and effort put into one video and his unique video style that cant just be copied
oh man! freakin funny!😅
Clipping through doors with your raft was still funny the 20th time you did it. Great video!
funny thing i just made a new friend called grace
Who’s shark. That’s Grace.
"Best Gameplay"
Adding npcs really ruined both the game play motivation and the story of this game. They don't seam to do anything so they are pointless and it creates protagonist syndrome. The guy at the radio tower could have turned it on but the player still has to do it like they are the only person who can. Also adding a living npc to the bio dome totally contradicts the story that all the rich people died there because they couldn't fix anything. How that woman hasn't starved stuck in the chair idk.
Destruction level 100+
"He's also right here, throwing dynamite at the whole town... this could not be more perfect."
Im always so excited to see how josh plays games the way abstract artists paint. Somewhere out there a dev is crying and it’s your fault. Gold star.
“Behold our prize,the Selene Dion key”
I think you like Tornados a little bit too much
Im not gonna be surprised if Josh does this irl on a daily basis
bean
o josh u goofy manz.
Door is locked from the other side.  Josh: "I'm sorry you feel that way"
The world needs a regular dose of Josh's insanity to keep functioning properly
i feel like josh doing things the normal way wouldn't shock a new audience, but it would be the most bizarre things to fans
Nobody show him Subnautica. XD
24:16 me brokes my leg my mom: Ah your fine
speechless
Hahahahaha
Imagine being sundee doing it normally
You are the strongest wizard
Almost 3 million views in under 24 hours. Well deserved man. Well deserved!
This is the most violent sequence breaking I've ever seen 🤣
he broke the game so much that he created a new ending
Congrats on #1 Trending!
Lesser men use the "report bug" feature.  Josh makes a video where he ruthlessly demonstrates the extreme limits of the exploit.
He just unintentionally speedran the game
12:00 My soul left and never came back again.
10:44 Why is bridge destroying so satisfying?? XD
you just made a new speedrun technic for this game
What about Supergirl get UTV get your face cos what's OXO one 24hrs in Tamworth
Why don't you call things Grace anymore? where's the Grace cameos!
I burst into tears of joy when i realised that this gem of a game was to be broken once again
Raft game designers are crying while watching this video
This was perfection
The fact that he is finding more bugs than a game tester is crazy
Damn I can't finish this video yet 😭 haven't finished the campaign yet
Thank you Josh. For sweet man-made horrors beyond comprehension.
Me: Exploring and solving the quests  Josh: Hold my Detail Blank
thanks for the laughs xD
Finnaly another vidio
I'm actually kind of interested how the whole last chapter was supposed to work
so effin hilarious
How is it possible to talk so much trash
When josh builds a plane even the Redbull won’t give you wings
ive never seen someone so lazy they did 100X more work.
ASDA energy that you do know you'll go far to Darwin
glad to see grace again
23:47 how did you forget to collect the sharks corpse
If he plays payday 2 i swear there will be more chaos than the game itself
Josh has too much patience
On snow  island there were viechels
Awesome content 😎
"Good live Come laugh Who float sail."Sounds like Biden.
yea and josh uses games bug and thatis very funny and cool
YESSSS YOURE BACKK
This content is GOLD! Be sure to never erase your videos, because they deserve eternal appreciation
This guy is playing the game unefficiently but he's still better then Timmy/Solidarity
im LMFAO! You’re very funny. & the way you talk reminds me of an ex i had.  Thank you for that really it’s pleasing.  Oxox lol
9:10 at first a was not sure if you are using mods but now i am 100% sure
I ❤ Sharks
6.6K th
mom!!!! josh is at it again
is nobody going to talk about his tornado around his raft🤣🤣
you made my day
O M G LESS GPOOOOO
That's genius of u Josh
People can just clip now using planks? ok
I cant watch all video bcs after 24 minute spoilers for me... Well sea ya after completing game
RAFT:require you to parkour                                                                                                                                                                                                                     LETS GAME IT OUT:no thanks
Wonder if the zip lines could clip you through the dome if the board can't...
#1 trending. Nice!
Those screen savers were the best! I spent way too much time watching them
No More Grace Joke?
You literally cure my depression, I slowly get more and more depressed and then you post a video and I see that life is fun sometimes and that is worth it.
This is the reason why Games Bugs are fix because of Josh.
Clicked thinking, "huh, I'll probably leave at ten minutes" and ended up staying till the end lol
If a dev asks Josh to play their game, it’s to see all the glitches and exploits that are possible
Hurricane Us lmao
Dude number 1 on trending congratulations
I audibly cheered when I saw the Board Tornado, reminds me of good ol' Satisfactory.
Just this guy's will alone could beat 10 floridians. He rivals graystillplays' masochism.
Tbh I hope they don't patch it, because it's optional to abuse it, either you can play normally or just see what you can do when it comes to pushing the game to its limits, Minecraft rules basically
"Reality can be whatever I want."
Also how did he collect enough wood for all of this-
Actually how much wood is in your inventory?
Lol u broke the game
Josh is a type of person that finds a random bug/glitches in the dumbest way possible lol 😂
0:48 actually scared me
Game: use a key. Josh: let me use planks to get in. Game: why do you have to broke me again
You know what, he makes lots of hours of playing a game, grinding, searching an all look soo easy, like he makes any game look so simple
At this rate he is gonna find one piece before luffy does
is the shark no longer named grace??? :(
7:41  Npc: Hey, a friendly face!  Josh in a deadpan voice without missing a beat: let’s not go that far
Took you long enough
Real gamers would know the Thumbnail changed.
Did he actually spend 9 hours in that time jump
How long did you spend on this? Him:yes
you are so funy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It wouldnt be the "let's game it out" channel without a nightmare waiting to be seen awake
IGN please make dev watch Josh play games series.
this game just never dies
Josh is the definition of being very serious on something that is not supposed to do
The ritunt of the King
they should hire u to qa games
hes just a free game tester at this point man
nice job getting #1 on trending! video was entertaining as always, great work.
All jokes aside, josh made the string lights actually look nice at the start
Oh god what did he do again
Ahhh, I love the smell if broken game mechanics in the morning 😂
Is this second hydronner?
normal people: time to beat up the big shark! Josh: *D E T A I L  P L A N K*
Enjoyed watching this short civilisation live there life
Duude! This was awesome!
LOL, pretty sure it would have been easier to play the game normally. But hopefully the developers don't remove this wonderful ability.
Went from #5 to #1 on trending within 30minutes. Congrats
When I tried this game with a friend a couple of months ago it was crazy-buggy and obviously was 3-4 years away from being 'something' in the end. A little later they released it... This tells everything. Adding to this the raft is the center of the world I'll never buy this game - hence it was great to see a "low budget playthrough" :)
Yoooooooo 1# on trending!
Bug fixer man
Woooo #1 on trending! Great job, and amazing video! Always makes my day when you post!
Has he played Subnautica? Will that be able to break?
My brain broke. Anyone else?
I got really board while watching this video.
I can see the wall clip Josh found to become an actual speed run strat.
Well this is the best raft video I've ever seen haha
Babe, wake up, lets game it out uploaded a new video.
2:41 RIP (mental breakdown) XD
Speed runner be like :

the best gaming content on youtube
I wonder if the devs watch this and think "This guy is a nightmare."
What happened to Grace?? Has shew been christened ‘Shark’
Every Let's Game It Out video notification brings me great joy cause I know I'm in for a wonderful ride.
When there is raft in the title, the sea wets itself
Josh live with 48 hours a day
Yes josh….     YES
im impressed how you can break any game so hard i love your channel
Legend come back
raft dev1: dude, bad news.. raft dev2: what? another bug? raft dev1: no, worse.. Josh play our game again.. raft dev2: Fk, pls leave me alone..
I love that.... everytime in everywhere when the character jumps from great height and break legs... Josh: You're Fine. 🤣🤣🤣
Finally fun
what happed to grace
1# ON TRENDING LETS GOOO!!!
#1 trending... I love to see it
Number 1 on Trending Congrats!!
Ah yes, my favourite channel, where a full grown man plays games TOTALLY normally
So BeAuTiFuL
you do not touch grass
how tf is this #1 on trending
YAY NEW VID
Omg.. You literally killed this game...😂😂😂😂😂
Remind me of the one movie where the whole world is thought to be covered in water and when they wind land, he chooses the ocean
hey when did u upload i was watching farming nightmare yesterday like 8pm in india
Dude just speedrun the entire game op bruh
Thank you for this video
Yo  Speedrunner!!!
"REACTOR MALFUNCTION?! OH, GOD! DO I NEED TO CARE?!" -Josh 2022 I have never been inspired like this before😅😅
Finally made a new one :) ur my fav :) :) be creepy :)
This is the ONLY channel that gathers more views the longer the new upload takes
And here I thought the conveyor belt was peak tech genious. Never expected to go full wood style hahahah love it.
If I had a nickel everytime Josh built an tornado, i'll have two nickels Which isn't a lot, but it's weird, that it happend twice
When the world needed him most he returned
this is why im subbed (ad watched ) all his vids, for the beautifull nightmares he is creating, and wow, 9h, now i get why he takes so long to create videos so perfect
I enjoy your exploit(ish?) videos. But man, you talk so fast and breathless, that I have to watch your videos at 65% speed to get a normal speech pattern.
Josh has a habit of making gigantic tornadoes out of anything he can find and I’m here for it
I was wondering what this man could do in Subnautica...  I'm not sure I want to find out.
This is the first video I've seen from this creator. I had a giant goofy smile while giggling the entire time. Nice.
It's that time of the month again :)
" Ok, Thats enough Youtube for today. "  HELP I HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE HEARING YOU 😭😭😭😭
Feel kinda bad for josh missing out on the snowmobiles
Seast he day
Josh in every collecting and survival game,RANDOM BULLSHIT HURRICANE GOOOOOO
Anthony! Where are you? We need Keeper&Guardian of HellGates...
i cant wait to see josh play teardown, just so we can see the demons hes hidden away in his mind closet
I see you brought this series back to life, i love it
You know its going to be good (and painful) when the update was a month ago
Oh~ I love this video.
I cannot comprehend what this man has done, but I enjoy it greatly
I wonder what Josh could accomplish if he played the game normally
I'd be scared also when a guy comically create and connect planks to get close to me
This is the kind of series where you don't know if there's a next episode but you're waiting.
I never knew a Wooden Key is more efficient than a Iron Key.
I want waffle fries
Can't imagine what a game created by Josh would be 🤣
I knew josh was up to no good when he hadn’t posted in so long
Fun fact: You can no longer create multiple little rafts anymore. If you attempt to cut a smaller section of the main raft, it will break as well.
Josh.
I find your lack of zip lines, disturbing.
WOW. This is one of your best videos yet!
I'd buy a shirt if you sell merch I need more of these videos. I know the game developers are mad hahahha. This is GOLD!!!
19:49 Sonic Frontiers be like
Oh my god yes.
I swear, every game he plays he plays as if he had mods but actually doesn’t
Until this video I thought that Raft is only about infinite wandering in open ocean with random small islands of resources.
Josh jumps from high place and takes damage:  Oh your fine
Do you have anything else to do?
I'm wondering if raft devs are like "WTF" 😂
Man been waiting for another video to come out keep up the good work Josh! btw you should give Space Haven a go, bet youll like it and its easy to cause pure chaos and Grace is in there too xD
I can't wait for a new Sims video
This video made my entire journey beating Raft pretty...insignificant.
Can you brute force the location codes or are they activated once the area containing the post it's is loaded?
Can you please do a video exploring the depths of the ocean with the underwater plank trick?
Plot twist: the game is already broken.
Couldn’t he clip through the safe?
13:03 time to speed bridge
Everyone in my house: what are you watching? Me: someone called josh making a monstrosity while breaking a game*bursts out laughing*
Josh’s patience is scary
Sorry devs. So so sorry (absolutely not sorry)😏
Best Raft content ever created...!
The makers of raft when they see this:   👁👄👁
Beautifully Chaotic😆
24:00
I wish I could see josh uploaded vids daily
Whenever I wake up and see that there's a new video from Josh, it makes my day way better.  Thank you! 🤟🏻
Imagine a guy pursuing you on a shaking self-extending plank bridge
This is art.
You should play this VR game called boneworks
dedication at its finest
FINALLY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Josh always makes my day
I Watch it all in 2x speed
Josh's video's are just different. They are so funny to watch and I can't get enough of them. It's a bummer they take so long to make sometimes.
"Day 16, this could be my final day. Over the horizon I saw a hurricane heading in my direction, I don't know how or why it is there but it is there and I must prepare." "Day 17, IT IS TERRIFYING! I NEED TO GET AWAY BUT I CANT! IT JUST KEEPS GETTING CLOS-" *Blood splatters on page*
I'm rather shocked and disappointed that he forgot he's already named the shark Grace.
#5 TRENDING YEAAAAAA
Oh this is so perfect, love it! Great work! 👌
Whenever he makes a video you just know you are in for a fever dream
Do people realize the ungodly amount of planks this guy has farmed to use for all those detail plank paths.. and also then the back and forth to refill his inventory... I believe the RAFT devs are very happy with this video. There will either be a huge patch to fix that details planks or they might outright remove it.
When ever I click on a video of Josh's you know what to expect
Can speed run using this tactic
I am waiting for the tornado to be a cocoon in the next update
7:17 Reminds me of Jack's entrance scene from Pirates of The Caribbean
I prefer brute force
Honestly the best YouTuber ever bro
This is graystillplays brother, gray loves torturing people, Josh loves to break games to the point that he reaches  100 spf-seconds per frame.
Nice work getting on number 2 trending josh
i died when i saw the shark
when is he going to do a face revial??
who remembers anthony
Hope you can do horror games but make it funny... I suggest ghost watchers
Ah always love your content ♡♡♡
i was waiting for part 3 or 4 idk, but here it is! this video is a god!
make a speedrun
Dying on inside rn of laughter😂
the funnel web gave me satisfactory flashbacks
It's simply amazing how he finds ways around things
the ending was soo funny
man straight became the wood version of ice man
The next thing you know is that they wanna get rid of this,, possibility "
Josh already found a speedrun strategy, clipping through everything.
"This will take us from Vegitarian to Balboa"
I knew it would be raft
It's just so stupid🤣
#2 ON TRENDING!!!!
Me: playing raft WHILE watching this. my internet: EITHER DO ONE OR ANOTHER PLEASE
Please play twoplayers and lounch yourself
not a Lets Game it Out video without Josh's character taking spine-and-leg-crippling fall damage and Josh saying "eh you're fine"
I wondered why was taking a while to put out your next video. lol should've figured
OH my god. LMAO as always
Comment for engagement!
Josh accidentally invented a speedrunning tactic 💀
“Hello? Hellooooooo!” Josh
Josh is the king of finding exploits.
Back is Raft!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I need a shirt that reads  "Sounds like a THEM problem"  ...and  "I COMPLETELY BROKE THE GAME WITH JUST ONE ITEM"
A boatnado
I’d love to see the developers reaction to your raft videos
I always enjoy these videos. Partially for the quality content, and partially because I imagine what the devs would think if they were watching too.
First part with the 20-year-old screen saver raft and the string lights -- that's actually kinda pretty! lol
I admire your dedication!
Why didn't I get notifications turned on
His refusal to call the shark “Grace” again confirms for us all what we already know… that he really is as dead inside as his voice suggests.
You and what army lol
Somehow I don't think you farmed all that wood legitimately. If you did, I'd like to see a summary of how many years it took.
That was far more interesting than I thought it would be 😂
you and greystill plays sound similer
What happened to Grace?
Can you play slime rancher
Josh you fool you just inflated the price of the detail plank
I bet there's a suspiciously timed "update" coming for Raft soon
You are a scary wood elements master
This is such a good video. The fact that you've already done almost all of the progression of this game before in another video, yet still made this one look as fresh as a new one.
I’m in Greece
HOW!!!
Nooo! I can't believe he didnt find the final ending door, you can literally open the 1 way door from outside on the ground floor just but looking through the crack.
So where'd did his life go?
I forgot how much fun it was to watch this guy hehe
Why is Josh actually a master of game breaking u shod be game tester
missed u
Josh:  "Give me a few minutes..." Audience:  "Uh oh..." Audience: "You reckless, MAGNIFICENT bastard!"
32 minutes? YAY
The shark? Don't you mean Grace?
at this point, Josh is just a bug tester
The rafnado
I only understand one-third of what you're saying, but hell, you always make me laugh.😂🤣😹
I hit like within 6 minutes of watching, then when he started making tornado, clipping through walls, skipping boss fights & the whole time, I was lamenting that I sadly can't give the video more than 1 like
How many times does he says normally in this video
the tornado... the frame rate... its not broken...
Haven’t seen one of these in a while. Was laughing whole vid. Thanks josh!
Ihis guy is patient af unlike me cause i'd just give up after putting 5 detailed planks down.(and he is creative with it)
Utopia burning - could not be a better ending for the Raft let's play XD
🤣🤣
"oh god, do I need to care??" Found my favorite sentence whenever I have to do something.
I have a feeling that you and graystillplays would be great friends
19:27 That was a scream
I am scared
What happed to grace why is it now shark
13:41 hop back a "board"  get it hilarious
A Let's Game It Out and GrayStillPlays collab would be a chaotic experience.
I miss his satisfactory and planet zoo series.
You literally made a Pac-Man raft 6:32
I saw a tornado in the thumbnail DEJA VU
Josh is that funny guy that we all laugh from all the chaos.
I wonder if you can get the world record for the most game crash?
he might have a 3090, but im still pretty surprised that the game is optimized enough to handle the tornado at good framerates
Im curious to see how speedrunners will use this
15:40 Only call of duty mobile players will understand
I’m just copying what josh is doing and it ended up crashing my game
I swear, his computer his from nasa.
YES MORE OF THESE VIDEOS
Whenever Josh says "all we need to do is wait" 1 of 2 scenarios pop into my head. 1, Josh sits there unblinking for hours waiting for the madness to finish. 2, Josh has like 15 computers in his room all running a different game that is currently in its "waiting" state. I don't know which one makes me laugh more.
Perfect ending
how do you discover these things?
30:41 what kind of sane person would be intimidated by a normal dude breaking the laws of physics, slowly building towards him??
Josh: *figures out how to stay underwater* Josh: *doesn’t make an entire base under water* Josh: *doesn’t call the shark grace* Me: *doesn’t give the video a like for the first time in forever*
12:34- I’m getting Star Trek vibes from that idk why
dude i just said to myself yesterday that: oh maybe hes gonna upload from raft in the near future beacouse the new chapter is out. and there it is, i can tell the future
Post more please
Omg this hilarious 😂😂
What a legend, never thought anything like this was possible. (Ya know until Josh uploads a video about it)
Bro you should speedrun this game while only "on the raft".
The cord 2011 is may b day
It's always the best day of the month when Josh uploads a video.
The doors are closing, don’t be left behind accept The Gospel today before time is up!  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.” Romans‬ ‭3:19-26‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9-13‬ ‭KJV‬‬
TRED
Josh is literally the Art master - Hurricane master, Gamebreaking master - Can noclip in the backrooms and the Chaos master
One of the best QA testers on Youtube XD
Who needs a Master Key when you are the Master of Brute Force
Thank god hydroneer devs don't have to patch up the bugs *he* found
How to break the game this guy got u cover
"Shark Friend"
The amount of progression skipping is both impressive and violently stressing me out
Leteth thine gameth it out
What a good YouTuber.
Good job getting into #2 on trending Josh
Rhis man has singlehandedly created the raft speedrunning community, if that exests
how long did this take?
23:23
2 milliom view just by 14 hour wow
Another classic LGiO Tornado. (Patent pending)
I love the effort you put in your videos, thank you
I’m your biggest fan I’ve been watching for two years
finally
Bhai main tumhara bahut purana subscribe karo please bhai per mat karva do mujhe channel
Dam Fortnite’s getting weird
On the thumbnail i though the massive crater was a new zone, turns out its just Josh's new tornado against sanity
You are amazing
Me when there's an new video: 🏎🏎
if u made a boring playthrough then call it a playthrough!
you should play fallout 4/76
this man scares game devs  he scares me too  its wonderful
omg "screen saver from 20 years ago"
The developers right now: 👁👄👁
hi Josh
Bro if i was on a raft in the middle of the ocean, my skin would literally be boiling (I'm paler than a sheet of paper)
I can hear the devs heavy sigh at just how badly you've exposed all the glitches they didnt know they had and giving them more work then they thought.
this is so hard to watch you sound like😐
I think if you fed Grace the pizza (monstrosity) you made earlier in this universe, she'd be more friendly (or not)
When the world needed him the most, he returned.
🥰🥰
YES! I HAVE WAITED FOR A NEW VIDEO TO BE DROPPED
My jaw genuinely dropped every time I saw this guy manage to play this game not as intended over and over again, you get a like
Oh no. Here we go again. I love raft
I hope the devs see this
#2 on trending!
Crashing the game is fun
Josh is the best lesson to any developer or engineer: no game mechanic, software, or machine can ever be considered fool proof, because the fools are the smartest people who have no limit to their creativity to destroy the intended purpose of your creation
YAAAYYY! I’ve been itching for new content! One video a month is NOT ENOUGH!
"Well I'm sorry you feel that way door" 24:52
what is it with josh and game breaking tornados?
You deserve every method of notifying me that a video has been posted that is possible
Y'know this is good when the video is 38 minutes long and 2.2mil in just for a few hours.
There's a reason that I mod the hell out of Raft.  Like E to pick up rocks/sand/etc, shark not eating wood (I mean, really?!), and other fun stuff.
Eyy my fav YouTuber is back you always make my day
SATIFACTORY CONVEYER BELT TORNADO HAS ENTERED CHAT
When Josh plays the game, the devs start hearing boss music
He's like the Wooden Silver Surfer with dementia.
Your videos fill me with belly-aching rafter
AGAIN😁😀😄😃😆😃😄😁😀😁😃😀😃
As someone with mango trees it offends me that you found mango in a palm.
Every time Josh posts a new video I feel like it's Christmas
Fortnite
YES LOTS OF STRING LIGHT .also I love your videos
I am a developer myself so if I were developer of this game, seeing what Josh did, definitely bawled my eyes out and quit my job🥲
"Welcome to this episode of Let's Game It Out, a show where we basically take our planks anywhere we want"
Do you ever sit down while spending countless hours on something totally useless and out of your way for a youtube joke and wonder what you are doing with your life
Cool, they ruined the game's atmosphere with NPCs and godawful voice acting. Shame. edit: oh they ruined the game with boss fights also huh, smh. Why couldn't it just be a wacky building game?
This was perfection. The ending could not have Josh’d harder 😂
I wonder if these developers ever use his videos for help in finding bugs and game breaking loopholes
UwU
YAY
Grace 😭😭
i hate how fake it is but whatever
Josh might actually have invented a new speedrun mechanic, idk if anyone speedruns raft but maybe
Alternate title : How to confused "How to be a normal people that think rational" with "How to become irational" and finished the entire game
I had so many laughs watching this video. Thank you for that.
I will never not be entertained by Josh destroying games.
I had to stop halfway through because I decided I really want to play this game and he's just speedrunning through it...
So happy to see Dorris again😁😂
josh is always godlike being in every games!!
*Feet*  Slang term for odd or strange sheep of questionable intelligence
astroneer has some new fun stuff as well, like trains and vtol
Cool
I love how you can tell that the developers underestimated Josh by adding the detail plank lol
Josh you should play Jurassic world evaluation
why is this so funny
The Legend Has Uploaded...
One of your best josh
Let’s gooo been waiting for the next raft video from you!!!!!!!
was this all at once? i like you your cool and your creativity is terrifying
darn, that guy really a wizard, apprear in 2 place at the same time
Josh there was a snowmobile on the snowman u missed it
that was great
OMG LOL Josh with his big brain surely will break anything he does.. What he does is completely Beyond nightmare for everyone.. REST IN PEACE his PC lol
Big congratulations for creating V’ger.
you're a legend XD
avarage 7 year old fortnite player
Always surprised that with how long video games have been around now that clipping through objects is still fairly common
I appreciate Josh's affinity for tornados; be they made planks, conveyor belts, or bear ice sculptures.
I love how he always finds a way to break every game lol
How i would describe my humor: josh, drew gooden, john muleany
You broke it so hard. My god.
God thought free will was a good idea until Josh found out about it.
Paint the wood bridige (the decor wood thing) white, add black rope and put a horse scull at the end AAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDD LONG HORSE
It's insane on how fast this video got views
Ultimate glitch bug broken gameplay
Grace is just done with his nonsense at this point.
Im surprised Josh's computer still exist and hasn't become an active volcano after all Josh has done he must be using an a nuclear powered super computer or something
when josh brings the graystillplays he will make the game from. One of those gta Alex challenges. to hello im no clip jesus AKA josh as i carefully break my legs and use exploits bringing catastrophe and satan to ur house.
Amazing
How long does he take collecting wood and other items?!
Dammit, once I saw the tornado ship I couldn't stop laughing except laughing hurts because I just had surgery but the ship is so majestic so I guess... worth it?
I thought the shark's name was Grace?
Subnautica players had ptsd at this moment, 16:50
12:36 29:46 LOLLLLLL
How long did it take you u been in much pain in building rip the fingers and how much pain did it take ya
i love how he can make something beautiful and horrendous at the same time
Are we not going to talk about how he is a better game tester than most game testers?
25:18 - 25:26 this guy is beyond crazy 😂
If I had a nickel every time Josh made a tornado looking thing in a survival/sandbox game, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot but its weird it happened twice.
25:20 Im thinking there is no way he tries every combination. Who am I kidding, this is Josh I’m watching
Oh thank god, I watched all your videos already. Just seeing tiny pixels in pain makes all my stress go away
It's finally happened another raft video. Your first raft video was my introduction to your channel and I haven't looked back since. Thank you for the great content as always!
SOMETIMES i get mad and think WTF JOSH why you no upload more often, but then i see you make more tornadoes. tendrils. brute force locks manually.. etc.   and i think. ah.. yeah.. i guess
did josh forget grace? (only OGs remember grace)
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
What I wouldn't give to be a fly on the wall when the devs see this video for the first time
finally,josh made more raft gameplay
josh the god of destruction
Only josh can take my favorite game and turn it into a farce.. but the laugh along the way is priceless..
15:14 YES HE SAID THE THING!!! PRAISE BE HE, FOR HE HAS BESTOWED UPON US THE WORDS OF WISDOM "YOU'RE FINE"! NOW LET US CHANT THE MIGHTY CHANT, MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS, FOR TODAY IS A GREAT AND BLESSED DAY! **insert chant here**
Wow
20:39 "if I can't use it or knock it over what's the point?" Josh is a cat confirmed
when ever he uploads it’s like cristmas eve
Funniest wall hack video in a long while. 😂
why dont we just put tons of people on rafts into the sea, im sure that would solve all the rubbish in the ocean.
Ayo! New subs here. and you took the whole cake 🤣❤️
Josh
Nice video
That thumbnail has some serious satisfactory vibes
You know Josh had a fun time because this video is 32 minutes long.
How long does it take you on average to make a video? But seriously hearing your voice is the best stress relief after a long days of work cause I know it was nothing compared to the absolute torture u put yourself through.
WHATTT THE HELLLL
Do you think they let him play games to break them so they know what to fix?
I wish every thing he did was in real life
You good sir have made me laugh and in doing so earned a new subscriber
Josh inspires me to exploit games as much as possible
Walking is too hard, today we break physics boys
Anyone know how Josh disables the UI/Toolbar? Is it just an ingame option or does he use a program of some sort?
You have to improvise sometimes.  ESPECIALLY when the game doesn't have conveyor belts.  :)
I was waiting for you!
I wish every thing he did was in real life
I’m just amazed at everything Josh does in this game… I’m just in awe… No words….
Hey so I talked with grace and she said “get back over here NOW JOSH!” She seems happy and wants to talk about movies!
Only Josh can show us the entirety of a game, in 30 minutes while breaking it horribly.
Pretty sure my sleep paralysis demon just got a sleep paralysis demon watching this with me 😅
Josh is the only person i really believe entering a code 5600+ times instead of just copying it from the internet
How much wood did that take? Please answer
Ive been with raft since it first release i completely forgot abt the game and now shocking bc how much the game changed
I thought you were dead 💀
he's back!
Josh is a legend when it comes to finding bugs
So funny, plz keep making vidz!
Josh is the type of person to see any game in existence and say I wonder how wrong I can play this game.
Love it! I am trying to create some video content, please see my channel and subscribe to help support my small beginnings :)
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yea yes yay yes yt
19:49 this raft is some Cthulhu level stuff lol
I feel like his voice has changed
the devs mustve been real confident about that one plank
24:28 — one of the best parts 💀
29:12 he’s laugh is cool
the only game to out build fortnite
This was just a blast to watch.
Just a little over half a day and this video already surpassed 2 mil views.
After watching this video now I don't know Josh's definition of Laziness
Wow #2 Trending! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
At last, I have been waiting for a new episode in the Raft series.
Average raft player:
Watching you play this makes me want to play and try break it in my own way :)
This is giving me flashbacks to his satisfactory series lol
My day will be better if let's game it out post something
He hate physics, and physics hates him. Still doesn’t explain whats happening rn 💀✋
He got 2nd on tending?? Great job josh
Only Josh is able to make his own hp lovecraft creature
I dont think ive seen him break a game this bad
This game is so much more substantial than the last time I saw it
Plank of Typhoon 😂
Yes…I love these videos
Josh: give me a few minutes Video: 9 hours later...
YEY JOSH POSTED WEEE ANOTHER CHAOS-
i gotta say this is perfection
YESssSS an upload woooo
This might be the perfect Let’s Game it Out video
Best speedrun ever you can watch on youtube🤣
LOL, That was amazing!!
The way Josh says, "I hope you have fun, I know I did" always makes me feel like everything is going to be okay. If someone can have fun spending 9 hrs building string lights, and make me cry with laughter, the world is an awesome place.
lmaooo
Raft+josh=DISASTER
huh
This nerd has by far the most annoying voice I’ve ever heard. Couldn’t listen to more than 30 seconds
12:06 This looks familiar...
Ah yes, the elusive mango palm.
I can't believe that Grace is back but it seems Josh forgot about her.. kinda sadd :(
5,463rd woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ahhh here we are again
Remember people next time you throw trash in the ocean you are just saving someones life with it 💯
this is the greatest thing ive ever seen
Josh is the ultimate play tester I swear to god he gives devs nightmares
Play no man’s sky
The thing that bothers me the most is that he called the shark a shark and not grace
I don't even care that he was obviously cheating/using creative mode for resources this was an amazing experience
Oh boy, I'm glad this channel is blowing up and getting the appreciation it deserves for your patience and time put into every video simultaneously. Thank you Josh!
In this video: Josh does an absolutely amazing job. And, Josh forgets what hyenas are.
Dude you and Grey need to do a collaboration. That would be sick!
Stability. Now that's a word.
You scare me sometimes
Loved the vid josh
What is it with tornadoes and josh? First satisfactory now this lol
What happened to grace
Love when see a let's josh game video pop up let wonder how he can destroy stuff
This guys a pro ark player w the way he meshed that raft base.. wait wrong community
Doors locked from the other side  Well I’m sorry you feel that way
No game was ever designed with Josh in mind
Lmao 🤣
This is really... mind opening I gotta say, nobody told me that detailed planks will give me space manipulation powers. Well, time to gather thousands of planks.
Your commitment to dumb ideas amazes me
Glad too see my little baby on Trending
This is the first video from this channel I've seen, and I must say I was unaware mental asylum patients had internet access.
Utopia series 2020 is a great show if you like darkness
it looks cool
A 32 minute lgio video is guaranteed to make any day 500% better
Thanks man been feeling down lately ur videos are always funny and cheer me up
Hate how long it takes but its worth the wait for this guys videos man 💯💯💯💯💯💯
after 5 mintues he didnt fcked up the world nor the boat... hmm something is strange here
Josh has the best laugh I have ever heard.
"now this is a boss fight I can get behind" what a pun
When Josh does not upload in a month you know his next video is going to be chaotic but wonderful
Honestly, I'm impressed that even though Josh broke the game, the game didn't break. There must've been hundreds of thousands of planks constantly being rendered from an unimaginable amount distances and angles yet the game never crashed, it didn't even lag. Props to the Raft Dev's for being one of the very small few to actually beat Josh's game crashing Fps tanking antics
Awesome.
A-MA-ZIIIIING!  You completely made the creators of Raft go back to the drawing board.
every dislike button was furiously smashed by dev team members who spent immense effort into designing the quests.      While the other dev team members who coded the detail planks watching them suffer.
Are you going to fight the ryno shark?
Please make more long drive videos
Lets game it out : insanity simulator the return of the insane
"Hello? Helloooo?" I laugh every time he says that in every video
yoooo josh im so glad to see your success! ALSO NUMBER one on trending, your absolutly gaming! keep it up
Why can't this guy just play the damn game as intended? ;)  Genius use of detail planks but is that really faster way to play?
Let's give a big clap for his computer that things die but it doesn't how many has he had
You should play spore
HE HAS UPLOADED LETS GOO
Finally
Seas The Day
Glad to see you're keeping the tradition of Josh's being batshit insane alive
Which chapter was this?
He can use the under water plank and zeep line to make underwater park
The longer the video, the more chaotic. Josh has blessed us.
Why not brute force the location code?
joshua’s mic is 6 inches away from his face
He probably will get his account banned from everything
this man has helped patch and fix games to an insane level at this point by creating nightmares for any developer
You know at this point I'd be concerned if he didn't break the server 😂
you know whats about to happen every time when he says ''Lets see if there's a limit!''
If I had a nickel for every game I can recall where Josh made a tornado out of things you're not normally going to see tornadoes made out of, I'd have three nickels -- which isn't a _lot,_ but it's more than I'd _expect_ to have.
Legitimately would have NEVER thought of anything close to using the bed shimmy glitch
Still waiting for the government to utilize Josh's mind for casual chaos to end all international conflict.
Remember both of those videos And I've never watched this 1
32 minutes of pure torture so worth it
#2 on Trending, Josh.  Damn proud of you.
you never let me down man LOL you always make me laugh
This is just Iceman flying around but with wooden planks. Plankman
Currently #2 trending video, Keep up the great content man!!  And thank you for the laughs.
oh boy some raft
Josh in this game: Im a ghost Im immortal I know the best algorithm

32 minutes later of watching a man talk to himself and walk on some fancy boards and I am thoroughly amused
This was more beautiful than I ever could of imagined! You had me laughing so hard! Thank you so much! I really needed a good laugh today.
I swear, josh can make a living by testing games early and seeing all the glitches.
we love watching your videos, just a half hour of pure laughter
Every time he says "Oh boy" I can just feel Isaac Newton shivering in fear
Whenever he builds something and then he says use The Grand Tour you know you're walking into the back rooms and the nightmare and hell you're just going somewhere where are you into a nightmare
I was just thinking, I hadn't seen a new video in a while. After seeing the raft tornado, I see why
Perhaps I'm crazy, but did anyone else think that the execcive string lights on that floating OSHA violation looked amazing at night?   Nah? Just me? Cool
This was the most gamed out game that anyone has ever gamed a game.
Josh is the ridiculously OP Main Character of every game he plays. I would absolutely love to see him made into an anime, manga, or movie. 🔥🔥💯💯🔥🔥
remember when raft was simple?
Glorious.  Best one yet.
Great job on the sound design in this video!
Legend has it Olaf is still dangling by those wires.
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16
18:55 is that Grace?
Some people read a newspaper or a book while on the toilet, Josh (the chad) reads sailing-themed motivational quotes
Beautiful. Thanks
Peanut butter
I think I'm believing Joshua's meanwhile hours like 6-10 hours or days I think you should believe what's his showing
Hey let’s game it out when will you play on hydroneer with a fan and record?
Oh WHY IS IT SO BIG
One of my favorite videos yet!! Haha
When you get 2M views in 12 hours..
Developers are watching this like: 👁👄👁
Whenever he says you're fine you know that something's wrong with their body
I still cCANT VELIEVE how many hours Josh creates these videos neturally
"Now, we can't stay on the open water _forever..."_  Not with _that_ attitude.
Josh: the shark   Me: grace
The fastest speed run of raft
wow🤣
My lord this is brilliant.
how to unlock the best ending
Every time he goes through the door he sounds like he’s having fu-
Literally every single time you upload my day gets 69x better
You sound exactly like Yuichi Tachibana from initial d. (The boss of the Gas Station)
I love when he makes raft vids
I've seen you break a lot of games but I think you broke this game worse than hydroneer
W detail plank
I love how entertaining u are josh.
My god, this is hilarious!
29:10 "i didn't realize we were dealing with a wizard"                                           -Plank Bender
that last boss must be terrified having a random guy with magical wooden planks that can phase through walls chase after you
2:41 Casual "What the Hay?"
I still can’t get the zip line thing out of my head…
I liked it better when he called her Grace..
How did Grace get demoted down to a common shark?
Damn this was a great one!
When you realize he’s using creative mode.
I need a LGIO and DangerouslyFunny collab in my life.
Now you should try Minecraft to test your ability.
I miss trash in the ocean, our shark friend named grace and building a raft made of fake wood, fun times
I really don't want them to patch this.
I love these vids. But you can't tell me you didn't cheat in resources. Which is fine to do, mind you, for the sake of these videos.
grace 💀
I would seriously love to have you speak at a software testing conference. You are the best tester I know!
Looking forward to Satisfactory's story, though I'm guessing it will be underground largely leading to less beam shenanigans.
My brother had a mango in his pocket at high school graduation which he referred to as his victory mango. He victoriously consumed it promptly after getting his diploma.
I broke my finger at work today, on the other hand I'm completely fine.
Dear God, josh... never stop. Not ever. Its not even sad how many hours I've spent watching you destroy games while I've been in recovery from my stroke. Even drove my brother crazy with it. Love you, my brother
bro the works!
josh: "besides why would we want to do that. why would we want to use our hands." me: "but your using your hands to build the detailed planks instead. so its no different"
25:31 the fact you tried that many combinations of numbers lol.
:|
Josh the lord of time and physic breaking
His Raftnado remindsme of something... Maybe the same thing but made out of conveyor belts
Let’s game it out I check every day for new content regardless of notifications
I laughed so much dude... this was great
I was missing grace ;)
I’m always sad there’s such a long wait between LGIO episodes… then I watch, and realise where all that time has gone.
By CLAIMING Last I END THEE COMMENTS
Thanks bro. New phone background
I LOVE ur vids!!!!
I love how josh can abuse the game so easily
"forbidden espresso"
This is way too entertaining
Josh is a magical plank bender
The guy backing away while you approach him on hovering boards is absolutely a valid reaction
The raft devs- This board will be such a cool add. Can’t wait to see how they use it.  Raft devs after watching this video- *horror* what…. What have we done…
6:26 okay but like it's actually really pretty 🤷😂 fr fr, maybe its bc we have improvised buildings downtown, but like I could see that being some part of an actual thing. (Or even a liminal space/AI art interpretation of abstract architecture) - I always love your chaos regardless 😂😂
Raftnado!
Josh, you are an absolute genius … period!🤣🦞
game dev : "giving a detailed planks was a huge mistake 🗿"
I just love when I get that notification or pop up saying "You have a new subscriber!" Or "Somebody just liked your comment!" Makes my day brighten up!!💫🤎🙏🖤
I was trying to liveblog this to a friend.  I wound up ceasing to be able to form words shortly after he got the detail planks.
congrats on #2 on trending
I love this episode, but he didn't call the shark "Grace" like he has previously.
He just created a game changing speed run tactic like it was nothing
Josh are you the real LOKI?
When I describe these videos to people I quote hp lovecraft
wish you pulled away to see the finished masterpiece of a ship
this guy is so dedicated to his videos and I love it
Of this building remind me of Fortnite
Caravan land looks like BorderLands ngl.
need to have a collab with graystillplays
3000 hours later, love the videos, wish you’d put a time stamp on how long it actually took you to do this.
Josh is a menace to society
"oh god do i even need to care"😂
#2 ON TRENDING BAAABBBBYYYYY LETS GOOOO
Babe let's game it out just uploaded
The first video I saw of this guy was him going to the moon in raft. Cool to see how far hes come in his antics
nice
isn't raft like solo teamseas
I should be doing homework right now... I can't do both because that's a crime... What do I do?
25:20 Brute force 0.o How long did 5960+ tries take?
Josh your alive!!! I forgot why you left?
Cheers to the best tester a game maker could hope for!
Babe wake up let’s game it out just uploaded
But but but... Why is the shark no longer called Grace?
this was PERFECT. NO ONE breaks games like Josh does.... A master of his craft. 🤘🤘
Play Arabs
"Looks like a screensaver from 20 years ago" Unlocked a core memory in me
That Olof guy must be Grace in disguise
Legendary as always. Thank you for making my day a bit better.
12:06 Satisfactory all over again
my dog died last night
That PC is literally made to fight god
Josh saying the beams look like a screensaver from 20 years ago just unlocked a memory I didn't know I had
"Give me a few minutes" Nine hours later😂
I'm literally playing Raft right now and shared this with them. We are in the midst of a "redesign" after being inspired.
It’s the one of a kind board bender
I have a feeling when the devs see this video showing a hell of a lot of Glitches & Bugs.  They will get it all patched and MAYBE leave a wanted poster of him worth 20,000,000 Trade Coins somewhere
This Josh guy really likes cone shaped buildings.....
"Hey! A friendly face!" "Let's not go that far..."
I think raft will added a wanted poster for josh
The shark‘s name was grace 😅😅 how did you forget
He finished the game in a 32 minute video   He did a speed run
Correction: Congrats on #1 on trending, my man!
This was an amazing look at the game from behind the 4th wall. That ending with the infinite bombs in Utopia was truly perfect.
hey Let's Game It Out did you know that satisfactory has more stuff for you to totally not break the game hints: nuclear bomb
I'm amazed Josh actually finished a game
I love how genuine his laugh was during this part 29:08 😂
This man broke the game so bad he created a bad ending that wasn’t supposed to exist
“If I can’t use it or knock it over it’s useless!”  -Josh, 2022
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Can u play it without making 1 million rafts?
The fact this was #2 trending for gaming speaks volumes I love chaos 😩👏🏾
Josh you need to make more videos like just make more YouTube videos please that's all that anyone ever wants at this point
Got on trending
Welcome to Plank Surfing Simulator!
Developer: _throws_ _hands_ _up_ _in_ _the_ _air._
Jhonny hot body
Congrat's on the trending! You deserve it, Josh.
Nice videos, but are you going to play two point campus someday, I have no deadline for you.
If you love “jesus” please subscribe the channel and watch all god’s messages
Yeah
Moral of the story: Never disregard the crazy guy in a survival situation.
YU MUM
Yo just so you know there is a presher washer game now.. I was watching one of your old videos the tank mechanic game and you mentioned something about that kind of game
i love complex structures     (lies)
what a cheater
games controlls are absurd lol.
You know something magical is going to happen when he say”only one way to find out “
"Hello? Helloooooo 🎶"  Makes me smile every time
LOL
im mad how long it takes him to upload then i remember how many hours, days, and weeks  he probably put in 😂
Grace
Ein Kommentar
that was fun to watch
My new favorite quote "Over my dead pile of boards"
I see that a new video has been posted 11hrs ago and im like yes sick and bored while watching an amazing video
Ah yes, the funnels have reached Raft...
How is this number 2 trending
josh made raft mincraft
Damn 2nd on trending congrats Josh!!!!!🎉
This game has the most accurate depictions of our real life oceans lmao
Insanity lmao
You know it's a good day when we get a half hour LGIO video
Wow this is the longest vid you ever made👨‍👧‍👧👨‍👧‍👧👨‍👧‍👧👨‍👧‍👧👨‍👩‍👦
I am so happy Josh is back to top three in trending. Easily the best edits I have ever seen.
The devs for this game were way too obsessed with keys and locked doors.
Weird YouTube recommended but good video
i looked at the thumbnail and knew he made a tornado out of decoration planks 😂
Breaking the game you say?!? .....I just found my spirit animal! 🤣
he's finally back lets go
YESSSSSS FINALLY IT'S BACK ON THE CHANNEL
Oh no the tornado from satisfactory is back
15:23 WYSI
This is amazing
If anyone can figure out a legitimate way to use boards to pop through doors, walls and such without any trace of your existence.... I need it for work in the morning. Thx in advance
this guy is legend.. he literally played the game the way I was not expecting
Raft back from the Back draft
I wanna watch you play Ark....
👉    👍👍
A month between videos 😢 Some of my internal content levels we’re getting dangerously low, observe below 👇   Puppy videos: 10 Those videos most people I know find boring: 8 Cheaters on Rust getting busted: 8 Creator going overboard in game: 4 Sarcastic commentator: -5   Inside my heart was saying, me so see’ad.
It's the sound effects every time he sequence breaks that really make this video.
Josh there were snowmobiles in the ice island you kinda skipped
Guy below me so smart that he poped out a eye ball
Nooo you didnt try the snow mobile 🥲🥲🥲 it is in the snow region 🥲🥲🥲
Someone *please* make a compilation of every time Josh says “hello? Hellooooo?!” in that sing-song-y way
Imagine if this was a multiplayer raft   You and your friends (if you have one) just playing normal raft then see a tornado boat with a man planking his way into you.
I love this man😂
You're the best game bug investigator ever. XD
Hey! You got Satisfactory in my Raft!
the dedication is real from that guys
my man is back with raft!!!
Now only did you totally break the game, which is to be expected. You broke the game in a way that sets everything on fire through the sheer power of sequence breaking
Thoroughly entertaining!  All the bonus points for editing in that *POP!* sound whenever going through the walls!
this guy is the embodiment of "confused screaming"
my man just grabbed that molten copper with his bare hands
Worth the wait
You can use stairs to the bottom of the ocean
Hey Let’s game it out Why won’t you build a beam that leads down to the deep ocean
I've been waiting for this for a month
Imagine if josh is paid by the game developers to find as many glitches and exploits as he can so the devs can fix them quicker🧐🧐
you did it again, you broke the game congrats!
I'm just surprised your computer hasn't stabbed you in your sleep yet.
I miss when he would call the shark Grace in his older videos
finally!!! it's a good day when I open my YouTube and josh posted a new video
For God so loved the world, That He have His only begotten son, so that whosoever believes in Him would be saved. (John 3:16, Bible). We have all broken God’s moral law and have gotten the death penalty. However, Jesus lived a perfect life in order to take our place and endure the wrath of God. He did this because He loves us so much! Repent from sin and trust in what Jesus did for you so your sins can be forgiven and forgotten. <3
On April 1st you should play a game normally to mess with us
The people who made raft are punching air right now
pacifist run in a nutshell
e
“AN-TAN-AH”
josh: "i dont even know how we're powering this." game it out watcher: : --they're solar string lights.
This is the sequel Water World and Kevin Costner always deserved.
this guy has too much free time
"Ugh; do I need to CARE?!" Never change.
reminds me of that one spongebob ep where he was building planks midair/midwater
19:22 Holy shi- 😭
It sucks that u didn't get the big trophy from that big shark
Yep
Just for background knowledge, "Insert Fuel Rods" means you're lowering the fuel rods back into the reactor in order to slow down the nuclear reaction, not something you had to find and place somewhere
I can't imagine how much time it took you just to get what you have now
Josh, I used to watch your silly boi shenanigans as often as I could.  for some reason I stopped the past few months and I want to say I'm sorry.  You really do poor a Jesus-load of time into your content and It's amazing.  Don't stop being fun like you are.  :)
29:41 not actually a ruffian, a scalawag. its the baret. it's a dead giveaway.
the string light's look really good
did someone tought about how long farming the material took 🤣😂
I was thinking of the Wood Beam weapon from Enter the Gungeon for this entire video
23:23 27:10 SSSSPIN THE WHEEL
#2 ON TRENDING
That was phenomenal. There were some twists that I didn't see coming. ex. hims throwing explosives in the town full of people
Don't put your trust in men, put your trust in God. Jesus is coming soon and it's time to repent. The Father gave His only begotten Son to die for our sins, and whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life. We are all sinners in need of a Savior. No one is perfect. We cannot earn salvation. It is a free gift from God. Only faith in Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection saves you. Mary doesn't save you, praying to dead saints doesn't save you, confessing to a priest doesn't save you, religion doesn't save you, self-help doesn't save you, meditating doesn't save you, Buddha doesn't save you.. Faith in Jesus' sacrifice is what saves you. Cry out to Him now. He loves you so much, but He won't force Himself on you. True love allows freedom to choose. I hope and pray you choose life.
10 yeas
Yes
Ah yes, he has cleverly defeated the game with the power of friendship and this -gun- plank he found.
awesome ending!
Ohhhh yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!
why would someone watch someone else play a game for over 30min when they have no desire to ever play themselves? and enjoy what I'm watching and hearing.
Finally you broke this one too !
this was great, guess it's time to wait for Markiplier to finish the game the wrong way now
Every game eventually devolves into Josh building a tornado
Alternative title: Josh places planks everywhere
You have an inhumane amount of patience, my friend.
I Wonder how long it’s gonna take him to find the railway update and Astranear
It’s been years where is Anthony!!!
Try to make a castle in raft
He took probably about 12 hours or more just to bring us a video props to him
I wonder if Anthony ever watches Josh's videos from time to time.
games: i fear no man, but that thing it scares me...
Congrats on trending!!😁
speedrunners take notes
I love how he finds away around things in every game. And is willing to put in the hours to do so. After all games are better when they glitch
Raft is so pissed rn
Oh my god how do you manage?? I have to have an organised space for EVERYTHING! You never fail to make me laugh man
Somehow I knew the second you found out about the boards things were just going to continue becoming more and more hectic. Somehow this man finds a way to break every single game and I love it.
That ending was perfect! His twins' clone playing independence day to send you off! Love it all.
I unironically enjoy this oversight for how ridiculous it is and genuinely hope they never fix it
Week 1 of asking Josh to do a collab with TheSpiffingBrit and break all of reality
Ah yes another video, another nightmare
I'm impressed how many hours did he take to make this video
Yaaaaaay
Josh, you are my favorite game breaker
it took me a couple of hours to get that two entrance key to get inside and he just do it in a couple of minutes 😅
You know the board bit could actually work as a video game mechanic in and of itself. Think about it, you can only move along a designated line a couple of feet at a time and it leaves a trail everywhere you go. 🤔🤔 Could be a cool idea, if handled correctly.
Man I haven't seen you play raft in a long time, this was fun!
whenever josh says he’ll do something quick: “many, many, many tries and hours later…”
Speedruning belike
How many physics and mind breaking things we have done already?
Is there an infinite resources cheat, or is Josh going on the grind of the century getting all this wood?
Ah yes. New feature successfully exploited. I love it 😅
So entertaining. Though it does stink it takes so long for content. :(
Lol he like just. If there no limit on an impossible built? I’m flood the map with it.
Break Vallheim again!! You were on the cusp of greatness hahaha
try adding planks under water and go inside the building you launched.
omg the spoilers! Definitely gonna have to wait to finish this video <3
29:07 he's a wizard Harry!
This is a pacifist run, lmao
Let's Go I been waiting
Congratulations to Josh for being #1 trending for gaming (1.7+ million views in 10h!!!!!🤯😲👏👏). Been watching him break reality for a while... However, Josh became a little logical and a little less criticizing and sarcastic about everything than how it was before, and I kinda miss that...
0:50 ello names Bruce!
I just felt myself getting too old for video games like this.
#1 on Trending for Gaming. Deserved
It’s quite funny how Olaf got stuck on the string lights.
I like how this was a relatively normal video until he figured out he could clip through walls with the raft sway. Then he gets the Detail Plank and all hell breaks loose. I also caught the shift to night time on "all we need to do is wait" at 10:16. How long was he waiting for that clip?
Josh you forgot grace???
"The Celene Dion Key"
Omg this was beautiful
This man has gone from wholesome YouTuber to whatever the hell this is
build the mesocyclone and the supercell of the tornado
YYEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHH
Devs watching this video right now: Nooo! You should follow the storyline to complete the puzzle in the game Josh: haha detail planks everywhere
Every one knows when they see a video by let's game it out it's going to be quite the opposite or normal.
Josh sure does love his tornado
7:44 LET HER GO SHE NICE WHY
It’s called i and angler fish
It’s this kinda stuff that makes you wonder if developers ever actually test their games lol
Okay, as long as no nuclear power reactors are implemented he should be fine xD
FINALLY MY NEW FAV YOUTUBER SEND ANOTHER COL EPIC TOTALLY NOT BAD VIDEO :D
This raft is fine
Every time he post I say oh no
when he showed me the thing with a “few ropes” at the beginning and I first saw some I was like yeah that’s a fe- then I saw the next picture and I was like yeah that’s not some ropes that’s a spider web you might wanna get pest control
Why is this 1 on trending
hey, when you get off the raft and onto the island after that long does it still feel like your bobbing like you're on the raft even though you're on land?  ;)
How did he research goo before learning the smelter?
BRUH #1 ON TRENDING
speedrun record any%
Number 1 nice job man!
This is the most entertaining series of sequence breaks I've ever, ever seen. Well done, Josh.
Congradumalations on #1 trending for gaming
Finally hehe he’s back with some raft
Raft's software department: *_*Confused screaming*_*
To watch Anthony go then have this channel blows up and maintain its velocity is such a roller coaster of emotions. How’s Anthony doing by the way?
How did you not see how deep you can go in the water?!?!
It's actually kinda impressive the game didn't lag after building the tornado
This video is a masterpiece
This was it his was intended
I’m convinced devs ask him to play their games to see if there are any bugs
Leave it to josh to find the easy way out
Yoooo the screensaver omg
Now thats a raft!
😦
Hahahah the plank made this game epic!!!
I'm pretty sure that the devs are fans of your channel and wanted to contribute something to it, because this is the best video of yours I've seen so far!
I love how you're too high, and mighty, to touch the ground. Who are you? Davy Jones?!... has it not been ten years?
You’re so mean referring to Grace as “shark”
I love breaking games!
Why doesnt Joshs pc have an endurance award
It's a good thing you upgraded your tornado to a solid 60fps
I can practically smell the Raft developers frantically fixing the Board mechanics right now. Even if they do end up fixing the boards, we will still have this masterpiece of a video Josh made.
I didnt click on this video this video clicked me
awesome vid as always though shame you definitely cheat or use sandbox features :( always was hoping it was all legit and you're an absolute madman but I guess not so much
Thirty minutes of lets game it out wow
P
Hi
Has anyone thought that Josh’s insanity is a disguise for his sadness of Anthony leaving
Can you delete your entire raft?
“Looks like a screensaver from 20 years ago”… man that was so good
"screensaver from 20 yrs. ago." 🤣🤣🤣
When he uploads, its a good day.
The devs letting his play just to see any bugs lol
Given the evidence he presents on a regular basis, I can only assume that Josh was engineered in a lab with generous genetic contributions from Howard Hughes, MC Escher, and Rube Goldberg.
Hel yeah i have nothing to say then hell yeah i just woke up
Lets go my favorite YouTuber causes chaos in a completely peaceful game!!!
Searched for your new video just yesterday : it was high time of my monthly dose of funny madness
"There's a gamer who's sure, All games that break are gold And he's building a stairway to heaven"
Any body that sees this, sub to technoblade, let’s make his memory eternal
This takes breaking the game to a whole new level and I wish I had half the insanity to pull something like this off.
Josh: Give me a moment  When the nine hour screen pops up, you know he’s creating a wonderfully terrible monstrosity
they added a bug just for you
I LOVE GRACE
Did you forget about Grace!? Lmao
This is a speed run without trying
Josh, has anyone ever told you just how much of a total cryptid you are. XD
Now I read this channels name  Lets Gamie it Outie
I JUST DID THE 1 CHIP
so this is a board game now.
These videos are always hilarious!!
I’ve been with you since the beginning and I can’t believe how much the channel has grow. And how every day you make me laugh
Another game played another game destroyed
He’s fortnite building
at this point he has 3 3090s in his computer to play games this way
i missed so much his videos
Number One, baby!
OMG MOM HES FORTNITEING
How come you never called Grace Grace? Did a Grace get mad at you?
I can smell the duplication glitch in this video
Soooo funny XD
This seems like a perfect route for a raft speedrun
THE END IS HILLARIOUS
I’m pretty sure that Josh won’t see this but I just have to ask. How is Anthony doing, are you two still in touch and will he ever come back to see how much the channel has grown since he left
....... 😐 me after the end if the video. The word "Skip" hasn't been so blatantly inputed into my mind before
32 mins off heavn
your willingness to bring chaos to any games you touched is very admirable Josh, keep it up for the good contents yo made
You ability to break a game is masterful!
*man falls from building* Josh: 👍
I see Josh has mastered the art of spinjitzu
I love how every new video he makes always get on trending because he really dose make very good content
Finally a video!
"I prefer my method, brute force". Ah yes, the Wheatley code breaking algorithm.
Pure comedy gold.
The number one on trending! good job josh!
Josh is the fear of the developers of this type of games
nice
That raft was actually beautiful , bedecked in string-lights .
Spread the gospel before it’s too late and if your not intreated in God or religion and in spreading the gospel you don’t have too!.
always the way to do it. best video I have watched all time.
Amazing!!!! Raft is a fantastic game! Even when played right! I highly recommend!
Play minecraft or house flipper pls pls pls pls pls
When you have problems, use detail planks to solve it.
"Guess we gotta find out where that master key goes"  *Up yo a-*
Josh: Builds tower of storage Shark: Imma end this man’s whole career
Oh boy here we go again in this chaos of a Chanel
it's a such a joyous day when josh uploads
play no man's sky, you'll love it
Game: doesnt have any insane glitches Let's Game It Out: "And I took that personally."
0:48 that really triggers my phobia of sharks, just coming at you out from the abyss
As always, why play the game the way its intended when you can play it the fun way!
1 on trending for gaming in like 9 hours
Only 1,598 meters away, that's like two football fields!
Devs: The scripted events are tested and working as meant to be, there is no way to break them... until.... "Hey there is Josh, welcome to Lets game it out"
Congrats on #1 on trending!
This is why we can't have nice things. Lol
How many years you use to make one video?
I very much hope they don't fix this / make a lets game it out edition where they leave plank 'feature' in the game
DUALLY noted? Bruh. Its DULY noted.
Oh boy its time to watch Josh completely destroy the game!
He's in creative mode
S P E E D R U N S T R A T S
You could tell how quality Raft has become, his game did not lag or crash a single moment in this video, albeit it may have on the parts he cut out but we'll never know
The shark? You mean Grace.
Oh no
17:26 just casually breaking the game and the laws of physics
Raftnado!
What happened to Grace?
this is somehow better that what I imagined josh would do with chapter 3
Other players:(does it serious) Let’s game it out: skips the whole sense
Imagine all the resource gathering and running back and forwards for more planks. That's at least 20+ hours
bruh who uses elevators 🛗
:)
I can hear Josh's PC crying out in pain from here
The man himself is back with my favorite game! Edit: 12M veiws on this video is insane!
how long dose making a video take
"why stop there?" and we never expect where it will take us
"If I can't use it or knock it over, what's the point?"
This is #1 for gaming!
Just imagine if they added an MMO mode and you see this on the horizon.
You upload, I watch. Hilarity ensues.
You upload, I watch. Hilarity ensues.
Saw the thumbnail for this video and nearly spat out my drink laughing. Somethings never change
I love your videos! They get better and better everytime
The absurdity is beyond entertaining 😂
bro how
speedruning :D
I would like to see a collab with Mr. Beast, him saying to Josh : ok you got a few millions to "plan" a nightmarish event with a hundred contestants, do your worst.....
This man is the raft devs worst nightmare
Only have to look at the thumbnail… WHAT
You are my favorite deranged YouTuber.
bro is making developers think twice
I'm dying oh my god the pop it's killing me oh my god
Is it bad that when I saw the thumbnail and the channel name that I was like yep that looks about right
His raft series is what got me watching him it's cool to see him play it again and I think this is one of his best
32 minutes and 5 seconds of a man breaking a game, time to have an amazing 32 minutes and 5 seconds
that wasnt one item, first item was axe, second was hammer.
Man.... I hope the devs leave this to be possible... I don't think one single other person will care to do it.. But I just don't want them changing it because of this wierdo and his wierdness
The Lockpicking Lawyer has nothing on Josh.
but why the shark is not graceeee
Time to watch a man break a game to the point of it crying and wanting it all to end
The amount of times I thought there was hair on my screen is rediculous
I don't get this game
Just dont do quest
Wow new exploit
No wonder this took a month, lol. Bravo Josh.
Bro congrats on #1 for gaming
Love the effort you put into your videos like 9 hours that's insane dude
Bro u missed something in snow island the snow mobil
Any dayz player has been threw the pain of comb guessing a 4 comb lock, though many never do it again for good reason
“Gimme a few minutes” … * 9 hours later * Your creation reminds me of what you did in Valheim 🤣🤣🤣 I can’t wait for the next video.
He's a human Wali
Wysi
You always cease to amaze me with how you always find cheats in the system🤣😂🤣😂
Omfg plys do more videos, i gonna die
I love your videos
Does anyone else.. get SERIOUSLY ANGRY...  THAT HE GETS AWAY WITH.....   EVERYTHING
Love when you up lod
For the algorithm
The only man alive who can break the fabric of reality with a plank of wood
Yoo could you check out jwe2 at make dinos eat people thx
give me a few minutes:9hours later
Sequence breaks are the best breaks
You know what, he makes lots of hours of playing a game, grinding, searching an all look soo easy, like he makes any game look so simple
Game owner be like PHYSICS? Yes/no NO THEY ARE DUMB AS HECK
Dude just made a new way to speedrun raft chapter 3 XD
d e s t r o y e d
Bro it’s probably already patched with the way you used it
Dude you are nuts!, Brilliant but nuts!  LOLOLOLOL!
wow
Devs: Add one single simple aesthetic item.  Josh: Proceeds to break the whole game progression with it.
The Shark is not "Grace" anymore :( That's sad.
"Good things come to those who float"  I bet Georgie disagrees 😄
you forgot to make the steering wheel and engine
There might be someone robbing you right now and you aren't even noticing them because they're on a board they brought into your house
It could not have ended any more perfectly than that
Josh's grand tour of unspeakable horror
If anyone needs a bug tester for their game they should just hire him
0:48 Where'd Grace go? Is this another shark?
17:20 I Think the robots are powering other robots and it thinks you are a robot so it shocks you
Lol
Oh no, no no no, oh my
When the world needed him most, he returned.
Congrats on trending
1# Trending for Josh is something to be feared.  He’ll break Youtube somehow!
"Okay. I finished the storage." *Shark eating all of it* "Okay, who cares."
Wow #1 on gaming congrats josh! Hope to see more amazing content!
In the ice island
You have forgotten to find the snowmobile
Me waiting for josh to call the shark grace so I can tell him I’ll always be around to ruin his day/raft👁👄👁
This was randomly suggested to me and I watched the whole thing. Highly entertaining!
I wanna see him play the game normally and than like this or vise versa
You good bro?? xoxo
local psychopath makes game devs regret having a dream
I'm so sad josh didn't use the bull shark head to make a demon monstrosity out of his boat.
3:50 Disappointed with no "Red Cross" joke. Also, 8:02 - She's clearly NOT people xD
You never disappoint.
Use for paint
Gotta say, I'm impressed with the game's resiliance.  Not only did it not crash from all this nonsense, but it didn't even drop to 1FPS.
Flower = cool
Poor Grace :( Did Josh break up with you?
hes probably a phychopath in a hospital in real life
Another day of Josh singlehandedly breaking the game with an item with no limit. What a good day.
When you got bored into the intended path
Tala: Hey! A friendly face. Josh: Let's not go that far.   I don't know why but this made me laugh so hard.
10:40 THAT WAS SOO SATISFYING
HOW MANY WOOD YOU HAVE
1:50 Grace? Grace! I didn't know how much I missed you until I realized I missed you!  23:15 And that's gotta be Bruce. . . .
Freakin maniac
I watched this after spending maybe around an hour and a half at utopia, somehow delightful to see josh skip the whole thing.
Okay but the real question is how does he keep a straight face saying and doing everything
Josh and his "Finger of God" , like straight out of the Sistine Chapel.
Josh just lets his intrusive thoughts win.
It’s not “shark friend”, it’s GRACE
The magic board is amazing
give me a few minutes.... 9 hours later...
RAFTNADO
YES UPLOAD YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO POOOOOOOOOOOOG
I love your videos josh. You are my favorite Psychopath. Man i fight depressions for almost 19 years and there isn't much that makes me laugh or even slightly happy. But your videos always manage to get me out of the hole. I thank you for this. please never stop. Greetings from Germany
Try to make a monster in raft!?
Deforest the forest
Grace
I feel like Vinny would love this channel
I haven’t even watch the video yet already questioning what did you do🤔
Raft developers watching this - 😐😑😐 wtf?!?!! Well i ain't letting this game be so easy with this glitches
Where can I find his theme music?
Holy raft.
Yay you posted I'm so happy 😊
wow
mom  ... i think i broke my fortnite
The whole journey of Josh and his path as the alien plank God building tornado raft
"I see our vision board is getting a little full." LMAO! 😆
Play city skylines
I was not prepared for a 32min long video!
thanks to this im currently downloading the game from Steam. Thanks Josh
One of your best. Really wanna see devs react to this
Beautiful, just... beautiful.
Great Video, laught alot. Thnak you for entertainment.
Not even Jesus could use carpentry to walk UNDER the water!
this one feels more like an ad for Raft than a Josh video
Early
6:00 yeah i know which screen save you are talking about, the one from windows 98
It didn't tell me this came out!!! I found it 9 hours after!
Ok.. I know he puts a lot a lot of time into these... But.. How the hell did he get enough to make so many walk ways... Thats sooooo much wood... How... Every body has trouble with wood.. But he can just keep making board after board   Did he use a cheat somehow
Can we just appreciate how much patience Josh has?
Oh. My god  it’s  ______
I guess, with a 75% accuracy, that the developers of this game saw your playthroughs and decided to give you full freedom to create your tornadoes and stuff. too bad it has no conveyer belts :P
Lets game it out : just a few ziplines. Me : that's like 1000!
why he sounds like shroud O.o
Josh forgot about grace 😢
Wait, why isn’t the shark named anymore?! I know it’s a new game, but isn’t her name grace?
Ngl the tornado is kinda...great not what i expected to destroy the Framerate :)
oh the classic "your fine"
Oh boi
See new Josh video. Post link in discord. PING EVERYONE.  Hehe! Amazing job!
YESSSS FINNALLY MORE RAFT
Perfect ending
11:54 just give me a few minutes….ALWAYS MAKE ME LAUGH A LOT
Bro just finished a roblox obby
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO
listening to the first gameplay part without the video is very bad do not try it happend while minecraft was loading
This is my favorite game that you play!!!!!
satifactory flashbacks when i look at the raft PTSD MAN
Satisfactory Devs: oh god he's created another one...wait this isn't out game, let's see how THEY handle it.
Did josh forgot the sharks name?
pretty sure the devs didn't intend for this to happen. then again with josh around perhaps they should have known better 😆
:)
beautiful!
He is just chaos incarinet
Recently beat the game and wondered when you'd come back to it. Glorious work as always!
the devs would probably have a stroke if they saw this
he shld rename the vid as "raft speedrun", HAHAHAHA truly a masterpiece
josh uploading is a sign of a good day
This guy has magic powers
Speed runners will thank this guy
My girlfriend and I wait for your vids patiently every month and when they finally come out we pull out our giraffe hydra plushie we named grace out and have a cursed little date night 😂 thank you for making this happen, we both love the content and keep it up ❤️
This is amazing, I know that it took him 10 hours if not more to do all of this, but he makes a 20 min video over the whole game
Yay another Raft gameplay!! 🤩
this video brought me so much joy
1,456,592 views 9 hours
Monotone voice and boring

Can't believe he found the raft after it went sailing away .. lmao
Finally
Yeaaahhh boiii....
how is your pc not feaking broken
you called Grace as shark
The Feng shui is incredible
When you hear “let me give you a tour” there is not going back from that HELL; you will not RETURN
He sounds depressed at sometimes
Thanks for catching me up on raft lore josh, much appreciated
Eeeeeek he uploaded 🥳
Im happy to see Grace in good shape.
This man outsmarted the game with Planks
“Door only opens from the other side? Well I’m sorry you feel that way door.”  *process to clip through it*   Had me dying lmao
Spoiler: (Do not press read more)       Man, Josh just skipped all the lore thanks to the magical plank 😆
Ah Yes! Just what I needed
Grace has returned
Woah what I also didn't know there were people, that's new
Grace is no longer grace :(
Was never going to buy it to begin with but it certainly was fun to watch you
I tried your original ramp to the heavens system to get to the top of golfball city in my second run through... and it worked... and I shrieked JOSHED IT BABY and punched the sun.
its so sad josh didnt find the snow mobiles in snow island
e
This is beautiful, it made me tear up 🥹
You post?
I feel like there was a missed opportunity at 19:29 to take the boards underwater to see if he could still get to the NPC
Some say Satisfactory PTSD, I say Satisfactory Revived
anyone else have anxiety knowing that grace could probably destroy his entire raft masterpiece with one bite. (edit) 12:29 thank god
Mf has built a career out of big testing games
Great to hear you again, It brings joy to my day.
Who hurt you.
didn't know josh made the sonic frontiers levels
What is wrong with you
my mom blocked me from watching ur videos because of your wacky ways to inflict cruel and unusual punishments unto digital creatures but now that im a big boy adult (14) I can watch by just clicking away to another tab real quick :P
This is so beautifully absurd
I just think it’s hilarious that he found a clipping mechanic that would probably be super handy in speedruns, and just brushes it off like nothing
i  kinda the same  as  josh
He messed up the game in less than 3 minutes
YES a screensaver from 20 years ago I love pipes screensaver its the best YES TORNADO RAFT
I cant believe that josh didn't notice the alcohol on the menu screen
Love your nightmare vids.
Teshin?
The lights actually made the raft look good.
Long time no see josh
the fact how he actually spends hours and hours into this video just to entertain us is insane!! love ur vids, keep up the hard work and thank you for the time you put in to this amazing content!!
the fact how he actually spends hours and hours into this video just to entertain us is insane!! love ur vids, keep up the hard work and thank you for the time you put in to this amazing content!!
My gfs only comment was "Whats wrong with him?"
That shark at the beginning  My face :😐  My soul: 👻
Noice
Josh is just too entertaining
I hate that he stopped calling the shark "grace", why Josh?
I will say once more but Jody play Jurassic world evolution
When I saw the tornado raft one thought popped in my mind: Satisfactory.
Oh BOI YOUR BACK TO breaking GAMES
The lengths that you will go to just to break a game is truly inspiring. 👏 Bravo sir.
dude i need to see a speedrun of this game using this clipping technique
if you ever ned a free bug tester just give josh a key to your game XD
You know it's gonna be good when you're laughing just by looking at the thumbnail
i Think every game dev should ask josh to play the game thay made before uploading to gather all the possible bugs      i mean, i've seen people play new game, but they doesn't encounter so much bug as much as josh
32 minutes no sponsor? Dang... I guess he felt really bad about exploding our ears on Twitch and wanted to pay back
"MY ARMY WILL CRUSH YOU" Josh chuckles, "I know"😆
#1 on trending congrats
I saw this when it was 8hrs posted
That thumbnail looks like a sick album cover or a poster for an intense action game
Red,flowers,crap,blue flowers,crap,
its beeen a moooonth thanks josh
No wonder this video took a month to upload😂
ra ra
It is always awesome seeing a new upload
AAAAAAA
Gray still plays and let’s game it out like to both do the same thing in games
Oh God no, he's making another tornado except its made out of raft bits lol
19:46
Game developers can just give Josh a copy of their game and he's a very helpful Beta player, finding and creating bugs for them to fix lol.
I love how Josh just enjoys the game and help speedrunners discover glitches just as a side thing
I love how Josh just enjoys the game and help speedrunners discover glitches just as a side thing
this.... this has made me so happy XD LGIO makes every game near-impossible levels  of fun, and for that i thank you
I wonder what that dude with a tire gonna do with it at 31:27.
game: "the door is locked from the other side" josh: *i missed the part where thats my problem*
wow this looks BOARD-ing
More than anything else I’m impressed by RAFT, it’s handling the tornado like a champ 🤣
Whoever's reading this, I pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
More MORE
Let's hope he posts more
👍
Noice
And puts a thumbs up every time a borde is placed. 😄
Happiness is seeing Josh upload tormenting powerpoint presentations
yay hes back
He’s like the Gru of video games, I salute thee.
wow
Just wait until he makes contact with Tomato Gaming.
How does josh make his rafts look more and more like Minecraft clickbait thumbnails
I don't think I've ever seen him break a game more than this. You just know speedrunners will be watching this later and going "WRITE THAT DOWN, WRITE THAT DOWN!"
He really broke the game XD
This is what peak performance looks like
As if we don't all hit like before we've watched it 🤣
PLEASE KEEP MAKING RAFT VIDEOS
THE KING RETURNSS OMG OMG I WAIT FOR THESE VIDEOS TO BRIGHTEN MY MONTHS
this video came out on my birthday
1# on trending! NIce Josh!
Beltnado 2: Rise of Woodnado
*Requires higher altitude*  Me: you’ve made a mista-
best content
I just think it won't be possible to replicate, but I'm on board for that
The platforms in the fog loke like some spooky tentacles, he is making a sea beast
turn it in too a cocune
11:59 UHHH
We need dev reactions to josh's and gray still plays videos XD
I'm a little sad he missed the snowmobile...
I think a nice addition would be helping survivers and they join the raft. You could assign then tasks.
here i am 27mins into the video and now i suddenly dont want to continue watching because im currently playing raft and i dont wanna spoil the Utopia but i wanna finish the video so bad x,x
Josh make a patch note for every game he plays
I was Never so happy to see insanity
I liked the Tonga (flag) raft
Kinda disappointed he didn't see if he could clip through the bottom of the ocean / go to maximum height.
Will we ever see a return of the Adventures of Johnny Hot Body?
Her name is Grace.
Try Scrap Mechanic next
I REALLY hope this video doesn't make them patch that board because it's a rly fun glitch
I enjoy a good, all in one Motivational office
This is probably going to be the speed run meta.
“Give me a minute” 10 years later. “Let me give you the grand tour!”
The developers of this game actually fixed some of the glitches they found from the last video gameplay of Raft by LetsGameItOut, *but he managed to broke it yet again lmao*  (And for a plus, we actually got a beautiful piece of art from Josh 6:26)
👌🤦‍♂️ these keep getting wackier hahaha.
Perfect ending 🤣🤣🤣
5964
this is a comment
1 one trending damn u are the most favorite game YouTuber
The shark has a name Josh...it's Grace
Play kenshi
this is 100% gonna be a speedrun strat now
You puzzle me oh this gonna take a while him let's use my board of destiny
Where did All the people from the city go??
DUDE. It's UNREAL the amount of work that you put into your videos. Like, I cannot even fathom the amount of time that went into just recording this and then on-top of it, editing it all down. You have ALL my respect and deserve every single sub, view, and like you get man. 10/10 content and I truly mean that. You keep me engaged the whole time and you deserve to know how amazing your content is. Keep slaying it my dude, keep living your best life and tysm for making this for ALL of us out here watching ✨
Someone make this man/god-in-hiding play Subnautica.
How many planks does he have 😭
There is just one word to describe your brilliance at breaking games... impressive
They wanna help us 💀
My god...
YAY you got number one trending !
You 100% dissolved to be on number one on gaming you are the best gamer I've ever seen except for aphmau aphmau is really good good You're both equal
It's funny that all of this could be solved by simply not giving the deco planks collision
Your raft reminds me of the giant floating thing from pathologic
omg a raft speedrunner
Bro can go anywhere in the raft and stay there’s no way he’s still drifting
*# of hours later* Aaaand done!
It only ever takes like a month for them to upload but it feels like a blessing from god when they do upload lol (also great video as always :3)
102919rst
I like how the "is there a limit" joke has been Josh's signature catchphrase.
This is why I love your videos
Why do I see a major patch coming in Raft's future? XD
This was incredible.. I know what the dev team is working on now :p
The planks are like a slow, ever-extending, quantum-phasing tentacle. You can run, but it will reach one, one day, no matter where you are, no matter what you hid behind.
Can we get Anthony back for one episode  Please Josh
hi
Hi
josh is just an experienced QA tester
this man loves tornados so much
Ultimate customization board! I love it!
Developer: adds literally anything.  Josh: abuses it
I have been watching your vids for so long that i know when and what time you upload
Ohhh we've missed you
Number one on trending, neat
What is it with you and building tornadoes out of straight line pieces
Can he unlock the door on the ship from inside?
im impressed at the time he puts into these episodes
AAAAAAAAH NEED MORE UPLOADS PLEASE
1 board makes it all fun
They need to add a building support mechanic so he can’t keep doing this 😭 he’d probably find a way anyways but still
Every post is a good post
This hurt me mentaly
love you videos
Game companies should hire Josh to find bugs in their games.
You figured out what detail plank really is for :D We have been wondering this for long time, but u nailed it! haha!
Forgot crate
Goal is to beat josh
Half the time goes in to epic construction... and the other half is just shaking his head and muttering "What Hath Josh Wrought"
When did raft and fortnite do a collab?
I hope the folks from Redbeet have a good watchalong to this video^^
I still question the fact you decided to swim towards the Crate, because you can use the Hook on Crates and Barrells, and you still get the same Loot...
Any time the tornado makes an appearance, you know it will be a masterpiece
There's not a single game tester that holds a candle to Josh's disaster capabilities.
“Let’s not go that far “ 💀
aww hell yeah new video from lgio new blursed raft could not be better :D
My mans become Sylvester from tweety bird hammering infinite planks to get to another building.
Why is his next one taking so long?!  Oh. I see.
This was hilarious thanks
Grace: Ok.. just wait for the time he makes something expensive then I eat it. 3:39 Grace: dang it the raft have rug can not eat rug
😶 wow I love to watch you
Every time when Josh says, “I don’t caaaarrreee!” You just know that an experiment of chaos is coming
HI
Yooo congrats on number one on trending!
I dropped my phone and thought my screen cracked. Took me a moment to realise that it's your raft.
I see the decent into madness is going well
6:27 there’s gotta be at least one swastica depending on the way you look at it
I never laugh so hard with gaming videos than I do with yours Josh. I love the way you break the game by just using the game mechanics. Keep doing your thing!
raft... FINALLY
Hello
FINALLY! I was worried that something bad happened to him and forgot that this man is a master and you can’t rush perfection
i love the planks just ignore everything
Oh no
It's been so long 🥲
Ngl the construction with all the string lights looked pretty sick
Dudes got Minecraft physics
Tornadoes seem to be the trademark of this channel.
I love how he completely destroys every game he plays
A day let’s game it out uploads is a great day
Im really happy you came back into raft
I definitely wasn’t BOARD watching this 🦉
Im so exited to watch this
He is back
HES BACK
#1 on trending for gaming, amazing!
I always celebrate like mad whenever Josh uploads, I love your content man NEVER stop
Finally
worth the wait
he is now the "overlord (or god) of planks"
Lol, Josh is literally playing "The floor is lava" 🤣🤣
1# on trending? wow.
Ok Josh easily proved this game needs more rebalancing and some changes done. Goodness I'd do the same thing he did to cheese everything.
I’m scared this man will one day become the Overlord and spend 6.66 years summoning the devil
could you use the detail board to trap the shark? then you'd have him as a pet
Can you get stuck with the current/waves pushing you into an island?
1.2m in 7 hours. No joke.
Wooo
What a chaos
Im always like, why doesn't he upload more often, and afraid you left...then i realise how long it must have taken to make this epic video
If a shark destroys one of the foundations will a giant section of it collapse…and would that be enough to to crash the game…
Always makes me smile I’m his vids when he says hold please and then 9 hours later
3:41 make sure you don't add more rugs on the sides or YouTube would be mad
Mrs. Josh is so lucky to have a husband who is this much fun! 😄
By Jove!! 30+ plus minute Josh content??
I am dismayed at the time it would probably take him to do all thos grand builds but then to also break the game so grandly is impressive
Ladies Josh has more wood than any other man on earth.
I like to imagine the reason the character groans when he falls is because he hasn't walked in a real long time
I lllloove this video
When I saw the thumbnail I thought to myself "I'll only believe he really did that when I see it"  And then the tornado came to view and while I was seeing it I still wasn't believing  (and yes, I know what he did to satisfactory and such, but still)
just imagen this plank wielding maniac gets transported into like the backrooms or something...... i think even the monsters there would fear him
I don’t know what kind of engine that Raft is running, but the dev team must have anticipated Josh doing something even crazier than his previous videos and upgraded it or something because the frame rate seemed to maintain the entire video

I like watching your cooking sim vids, raft vids and planet coaster and zoo. they just make me laugh so much🤣
Just broke it. Broken.
0:49 that is pretty etch-a-sketch
This may be Josh's Magnum Opus of game breaking. Truly a work of art
Bro started playing fortnite
Was waiting from the moment they released the update
Came here in hopes of snowmobile shenanigans, got reality-bending carpentry instead. 10/10
why no call shark frend grace?
Is there any chance you will ruin valheim? Josh? Please...
Oh boy! Man made horrors beyond my comprehension!
Bro it’s a yacht not a cruise ship
Speedruner
Running out of ideas Josh? I've Already seen a completely useless tornado definitely working as intended.
I thought the shark named grace?
3:33 "You sure can!" "You sure can't!" That ruined me. The video just begun and I'm already in stitches.
#1 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING
🤣🤣🤣 Halaious! I don't think iv laughed that hard in a while! 26:05 omg calm down! 👉👍
WOOOO A NEW UPLOAD YEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Those blocks weren't trying to spell Hell. The game was trying to call for help.
You know it’s about to be horrifying when Josh says “you know, this gives me an idea”
Hi
Josh made a rampway to heaven.
Guess we all know wich cartoon charter was his favorite...
“ give me a few minuets” *nine hours later   You know your in for a ride
"is there a limit to this" "how can we use this" "will the game let me do this" "i wonder what happens if..." signs of impending doom
6:31 that looks nice tbh
me when I see a new lets game it out video: "yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss"
I listen to Josh on 1.5 speed.
Yes another epic day of let's game it out
The safa returns, the saga we've all been wating for.
Hahahaha
4:56 you have metal ingot researched but at 5:09 you build your first smelter :(
I audibly said "Oh yes" when I saw a new LGIO Raft video
Oh it's gonna be good 😁
Yaay
Happy birthday 🎈🎂🎁🎊🎉
haha i love how he actually brute forces the codes
josh you are the reason i have -92764721234569e92
play the game normaly  josh: no, thanks i prefer abusing every mecanicanic in the game
Josh what did you do
This channel always makes me happy...thank you!
Hi
It doesnt have to connect to anything....my god they have given him too much power
congrats on number 1 on trending
How many hours/weeks did it take to gather all this wood? Amazing Video.  I‘ve watched a lot of playthroughs of this game but nobody played this game so clever like you did. I love it.
He basically invented the glitch speedrun of raft
Game Developers don’t need to hire beta testers anymore, just give Josh a copy and let him go nuts
If you got hold of nuclear codes, we'd be dead in seconds.
Why was the Island code the year I was born
I was sure you were going to get to the bottom of the ocean on your magic plank.
Josh spends so much time on these videos to entertain us. I honestly hopes he gets a whole ton more subscribers!
Oh boy, another tornado. You spoil us
Can u post more often?
I thought the shark was named Grace.
What happened you had not been posting 🤔
When Josh says: Gemme a minute. You know it's gonna be a bit more then just a minute.
i swear i just saw the title change right when i was gonna click the video
We need a Satisfactory-Raft Crossover right now
Hi
we need more jonny hotbody
always amazing to see games played in Josh's way
PvP: there is a new thing to mess around with Let’s game it out: * uses it the wrong way* The game: help!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You’re not supposed to do this!  Everyone: I don’t give a 83&2@&
What. The. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
“We made a tornado raft” Satisfactory memories
holy
Dude sounds like squidward
I'm honestly kinda impressed the engine didn't crap itself with that many user placed assets.
This is the origin of the Stanley Parable Adventure Line (tm)
normal way is breathing under water
Mmmh, yes. Things… Never can get better.  Edit- Whenever I say “Never” , I always think about, that…
Have you ever played subnatica? I think you’d find it’s glitches quite enjoyable
Game update log: “fixed most bugs.” Josh: “oh, I don’t think so.”
Josh be like: OMG I have to play the game the intended way which takes me 5 minutes Also josh: time to brute force this passcode 🤓
Attempt 2 at asking josh to play gta5
This is just a worse version of WaterWorld
Okay, the thumbnail is really good
12:12 I'm getting deja vu from this
satisffactory is shaking in there boots
god almighty help me for what i seen surpass my existence.
This is gonna go down as one of the greats, Josh. Well done.
The legend has returned after a month
my face when I see 5960+ tries later...
Speed run this game next
How addicted to fortnite are you?  Josh:
god almighty i love your videos josh, theyre feckin hilarious
Your video are an absolute highlight of day. Keep up the amazing work!  I can only assume how long these uploads take to record and edit so thank you for all that you do.
if he says one minute later he probably means an hour lol
my god he's back
RAFTNADOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
dude found a new speedruning tatic
*plank*
I’ve missed grace the shark
I love how u break games..never change hehe. thanks for sharing
His poor pc is crying out loud to me "save me from damnation".
"Who float sail" just about destroyed me, send help, can't breathe.
Josh dont do this... edit: GODDAMMIT HES DONE IT AGAIN
23:41 *the sharkest tool in the shed*
It’s always an adventure when josh uploads a new video
WHat has he done
I am really impressed that the game kept running smoothly with that many planks stretched over such a large area. Good on ya devs.
Can you play Rust?
YESS! Love your content Josh! I watch it everyday
yes josh YESSS
Nice #2 in trending
i knew this was coming
I love seeing the game I put so many hours in being completely broken. The amount of time he spent off camera to get that amount of detail planks is actually hilarious. The sequence break was just the cherry on top haha
Marvel add Captain Planks to your universe already.
Josh, your videos are truly hilarious. When you watch funny content you often don't even smile, but with your videos I am laughing loudly for most of the videos length. Absolutely perfect!
We need merch that says, "Good Live, Come Laugh, Who Float Sail" asap please and thank you
y e  s
I hope you realize when robots become self aware they're coming for you first.
in the snow place there is snow jet ski
You sir are incredibly efficient at putting a smile on my face
I was awaiting for this
Hi!
You know your day is gonna be Good when Let's Game It Out release a new Video
Joshhh we missed you!
Sbscbx to cy dhanmel plwesa
Josh, please never change. 😃👍
I swear did he just create a new speedrun strategy?
"Good Live, come laugh who float sail."  Yes, I get it. Indeed. Thank you.
Patch notes: Player can no longer collide with detail planks
28:01 really thought he was about to something else for a sec
Can you pls play city skylines next 🙏
games final part releases. josh: "hold my plank"
I'm forever in awe of how consistently and efficiently Josh is able to break every game. He is the definition of chaotic neutral.
so, that's how UFO are made.
You know, I don't think this game is very realistic.
RIP anyone who tries the underwater planks technique after the devs see this video.
YOOo
Watching this when it's 7 hours old.
i only found you yesterday bc of planet zoo, you definitely have graystillplays vibes and im loving it :D
He is back.
play slime rancher
I’ve been anxiously checking everyday for the last few days 😤 i missed your voice you deranged mess freak ♥️😂
Using the bed to clip into the yacht blew my mind.
Hu
The devs are gonna love this one.
This man.. he goes beyond, the game rules.
aaaaaand the Raftnado is born!!
Oh boy
So great hahaha
What happened to Grace?
I did not expect you to come back to raft which is pretty awesome
how many tornadoes can josh make in games before they become a thing?
Best channel om YouTube!
What kind of water planet is this where the ocean is endless enough you can have a community to have a reputation with
You know it's going to be terrifying when it's a raft video
Always look forward to these videos, today’s one was a dinger XD
This took so much effort thank you so much for the video
Josh just took the term ”walking the plank” to another level
Serious satisfactory flashbacks
Josh: let me take you on the grand tour! Me, watching: oh god what stage of hell did you make this time? His PC: *EVERY STAGE*
Great Job getting #1 On Trending!
As a side note; adding a story to a sandbox game is only really a good idea if it's a GOOD story. We're getting the abridged version, but this seems like a placeholder.
Josh: “It doesn’t have to connect to anything?”   The game and his PC: "WAIT, no. plz. I beg you."
Best raft episode ever😆😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣
That's something we did'nt deserve...But we needed.
How long have you been playing this to get through the Game?
30:40 This sequence made me imagine how this would look from normal person's perspective: a man is slowly coming towards you on a magical flying ever-extending plank that is ripping the space itself apart, there is nothing you can do to stop him, you can only run in terror, while he is still coming for you, clipping through every obstacle you've build against him.   This sounds like an anime main villain ability, and a scary one if you ask me. And imagine what we can achieve if we add his other bizarre techniques from the other games he's -destroyed- played
Bruh flowers aren't useless you can use them to make paint and paint your raft   How many times paint was said on this is 3
The amount of wood that was used in this video
numero uno on trending for pro gamign
These videos never disappoint. Makes me want to make a ridiculous and wonky survival game just so Josh has more material to make videos about lol
Anyone else remember when there where 2 people on this channel
I've watched you before so I know you do outrageous things but that tornado raft reveal got me good.
13:26 the board express! ICANT
bro the video is number 1 on trending for gaming
@23:40 Don`t you mean:"Sharkest tool in the shedd"?
I missed you really bad.
My ocd during this video:
He is a force of nature
Honestly josh, you probably could have broken this one up into a two-parter, would have been still just as entertaining 👍🤣
Excellent. Just excellent.
Great video 100000/10 detail planks!
Next bug fixes just need to have "Let's Game It Out" in credits
oh god finally some decent parkour game
This is the only correct way to play raft
“Oh boy” ✨🧖‍♂️✨  Just as the grasping fingers of collegiate depression begin to indent within my psyche.
Hi josh
yay
I feel like it's the hardest Josh has broken the game
#1 trending
Do satisfactory again!!!
Josh and his f-ing tornadoes 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You missed the jet ski in the ice place
You're like the QA tester from hell.
Bro just made a speedrun with a Lets play video
#1 on trending for gaming good job!!!!!
3:53
Your demonic patience slays me every time. Oh my god.
Idea: if you still have the tornado, then add clouds to the top with lightning
The first video I watched on this channel was the second raft video so it feels so good to see the third.
That's a nice shiny new game mechanic you got there.  Sure would be a shame if someone were to LGIO-ify it.....
And once again, manually brute forcing 5,964 combinations. You'd think the coders would add a lockout for additional fun.
olof just standing there sweating and trying not to notice: josh walking through a wall and bridging directly toward him:
1M views in 6h and it’s not trending?? YouTube algorithm doing weird things again
I thought the thumbnail was a new location in Raft. But no - it's a madman's twisted idea of a raft. I like it!
when he actually goes under water at 21:36 theres no air meter. but hes swimming. is that a cheat ? i mean hes not using his plank trick theres just no air meter.
OH BOY A NEW WAY TO DESTROY A GAME
To the regular viewer It’s like josh imputs some konami cheat code or something
YOOOO 1# ON TRENDING….      FOR GAMING!
I was drinking something at 7:38 in the video and the drink almost came out of my nose
Nice raft design! Very "eldritch nightmare from beyond space and time coming to devour the universe one island at a time, enveloping its prey with countless tendrils until it has sucked all the nutrients out like some horrifying parasitic slime mold", and the fairy lights are very cute!
I bet the devs didn't see all this coming with that new item ah...
**almost dies every time watching🤠🤠🪳🦝**
Ah Raft. One of my favorite Let's Game it Out punching bags.
YES HES BACK MY FAV YOUTUBER
you should try thrive its a spore-like game about evolution with a programmed evolution software evolving the other creatures its open source so im sure the devs would appreciate someone breaking everything and im sure you would create something insane
Les go another upload
Josh’s computer: *exists* Josh every episode: “do you want to explode?”
Does that plank cost 0 wood or do you have a horrifying amount of it
*Josh builds scaffolding*. Me: "oh, this actually looks good." 2 seconds later... Me: "Ohh... Nevermind." Edit: Mom I'm famous
I love how spoiler-free this is.
Can you please do stray?

🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Josh I love your channel and I got lost when watching your video
Woooh tornado raft, reminiscent of the tornado in satisfactory
Josh is always trending when he uploads and that shows he is the best
You need to build a detail Plank box around the shark.
I love these videos !
Hey Josh 👋 please make Another Video of The Sims and The Great Keanu 😂 iam crying every Time 😂
His creative lunacy knows no bounds. 🤣🥰
ALL HAIR THE TORNADO
Josh: The funny psychopathic lad.
lmfao, #1 on trending? are we gonna get like, a whole genre of people breaking games now as they copy this? (please say yes)
I was gonna complain about his upload speed but I remembered Internet historian has not posted in 2 years
Its been way to long since u uploaded
I wish i could have this guys patience
YAY
Finally he made a video I was waiting for so long
I personally liked raft better with no people in it
Games need anti-Josh features
10:38 Vasagatan? Wtf? Det var som fam 🇸🇪
YEs ItS ChAos DaY
Finally the world is at peace
huzaaa! another beautiful example of the beautiful exploitation of game mechanics, i love it!
I mean Josh
hiatus why did I say the channel name
they basically put god mode on that plank and Josh found it haha
"Hey there, it's Josh!" Developer: 😰 Program: 😱 Computer: 😤 Me: 🤩
You should try playing City’s Skylines!
Let’s game it out is literally the best
Number 1 on trending! Josh that is so cool!
I would love love love an IGN “Developers React” for this video. Although it’s probably the first thing they did when getting up this morning.
Sometimes I’m concerned for this man, but then I remember he is Let’s Game It Out, a mythical being that can control time and luck with ease and what he uses it for? the entertainment of many people.
Play Terraria
A victory mango in under two minutes in
Play Minecraft
#1 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING - insane
Youre just the King of Game breaking hahaha
Johnny Hotbody the 2x4-bender is chaos to be feared.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just when I thought I’d had my fill if that Craft’m’Up…
1milion views in a day?!?!?
Back to the basics, huh? You really need to revisit the Sims sometime
This was awesome!
Why do I watch Josh when he keeps destroying every game that I like!?
I love how Josh made half of the satisfaction cocoon thingy
Oh yeah! Nothing like a red pill to cure my depression. Like the video: Check! Coke: Check! Popcorn: Check! Now let me dive in, in this sea of joy!
Great "Josh games" generally fall into two categories.  Hilariously broken games where anything is possible by mistake, and intentionally hilarious sandbox games designed to be that way.  By adding this new, "build planks anywhere, any way you like," feature, this game now sits at the intersection of these categories.
My favorite part was the Celine Dion concert
I was here within six hours of the video going up beat that
I am always amazed by your seemingly endless motivation to break down games to their most stupid breaking points.  Can't imagine how long it took to make the tornado thing.. 9 hrs sounds about right...  I salute you, sir
I just realized right beside the video, I saw an ad that said, I s**t you not, *the hottest woman ever* a very motivational quote indeed
I need more madness
wow dude you are number 1 trending for gaming congrats
Whenever he said oh boy it's time for raft I knew my day was about to be made
6:30 it looks so pretty :)
josh always finds at least one way to break the gamep
eZ speed run  😂
Let’s create more hell what’s the next game guys reply here let’s all gather the ideas :)
*_Lmao the king came back and made a whole tornado raft in a single video_* 😂
Item removed in 3...2...
If I had to sum this up I would go with: Good ol' perfection.
Shark Bait Who Hah Hah!
beautiful
Totally impressed by your board-nato! And here's me thinking I had to use conveyor belts! Live and learn I guess.
It started boring but then you really outdid yourself.
Josh ' string lights will be perfect' Me ' Oh no!  What horrible, blinding abomination will it be...' Me 5 seconds later 'Wait, it's, it's actually really pretty!?  Josh, how did your chaotic self create this thing of beauty??'
No way you actually did this
YES HE FINALLY MADE ANOTHER RAFT VIDEO IM SO HAPPY
Well what the hay, why stop there. His pc:NO NO NO PLEASE JOSH DONT DO THIS TO ME AGAIN
B O U R D
You make my day you are so funny😄
1 ON TRENDING LES GOOO
i was jumpscared by the shark
The scafolding raft looks like it's falling apart with all the planks in the water around it
Oh i remember this game! I was kinda addicted a few years back >.<
Tornado was a nice touch 👌 😂🤣
Josh posting a video is like christmas but it comes every month and never disappoints
Yo he's back also congrats on trending In first place
Tus videos me dan la vida!! ✨✨
LETS GO MORE RAFT
1# Trending for gaming
✨forbidden expresso✨
no wonder it took a month
that was amazing
LMFAO thanks mate now none of us will get to do this because it was probably hot fixed as soon as this video came out
He did it, the mad man did it again
Any time Josh says "Give me a few minutes/seconds" you know you're about to see an ungodly amount of hours on the screen.
dam
I would love to do this for living destro games in the worst way possible
6h ago. i was late, but it was worth it. current comment count: 3.6k.
why not make a tornado for literally every game you play?
is he cheating?
I feel like he just found the fastest way to speerun the game
The more islands he goes to the more his arsenal grows
thanks for u8ploading raft is one of my favorite games
You're so creative you should try Stormworks: Build and Rescue. Would love to see you play it.
Now add nuclear reactor inside
Josh, You're the best!!! Greets from PL
Another easy solution for 'exploration' is to set the character altitude in your save file, and drop onto the island from orbit. 🤣
should play stellaris
the tornado reminds me of the conveyor tornado in satisfactory
Your the best  Every day i check if you downloaded a new video 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
love the upload schedule my guy
Josh turned his raft into a keter class SCP.
Mangos are MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
wow
Will they ever make a game Josh can NOT break? I sure hope not.
Finally you uploaded yay
YAY HES BACK WITH RAFT
I lost it at tornado...
they added just a plank, and it broke the whole game :D
This is so entertaining :)
When I hear hey there it’s josh I get excited and terrified at the same time
Grace must have got a upgrade only a og  would know Grace is the name of the shark from the first raft video
josh uploads makes my day
he has such a beefy computer
Meeeen,  I missed this game soooo much pfoooa👏👏👏
6 he early and it's #1 trending on  gaming
Josh be like on top of his infinity scaffolds: I see no god up here...  BUT ME
RAFTNADO WHEN
I love how much you just sequence broke the story of the game.
i was wandering where he went over last month LOL
Dammit, when Josh gives a grand tour you know you're about to see at minimum 60 hours worth of suffering.
The Time I Post This Comment Is The Time I See He's "#1 On Gaming Trend" Meaning Almost Everyone Has Seen Him Break The Game To His Favor With Just One Item.
New Fortnite map goes hard
Yes 1
Josh in this video sure didnt make very big bridge that defenitly did not try to make tornato
Seriously, just open the save file with a hex editor and add all of the items. Running from sharks hourly to collect the handful is mind-numbing. 🤪
29:25 i dont have a key
This video should just be called : how to break raft in two easy steps
Oh no. The PC still cant escape from the Joshs Tornado funnel.
Bro is 1# on trending for gaming in just 6 hours
Pls do Skyrim I already saw a taste pls give me a full course!
He just did a speedrun with a tornado
With his new trusty tool, Josh has become an expert locksmith
Great
You grind a lot of planks
19:00 that right there is Grace
the finger is called the judgemental finger
my buddy and I also figured out you can use the fishing rod anywhere... like, on the island fishing on dirt
someone: hey josh did you hear about the backrooms? *josh: uses planks to go to the backrooms* someone: …
Shyamalanian twist if I've ever seen one.
Oh god
Now all you hang to do is speed run the game
Josh just casually discovering methods to ultra speedrun the game
This man has the same craziness as graystillplays I like it
loolllll
Imagine Josh trys to do minecraft for a speed run wonder how long it be lol
This man just became iceman for wood 🤣
14:47
I love channel! Where else can you get UFO hunting with cheap cars with junk hands and plank tornadoes?
josh his raft looks likes the wither storm tbh, with all the bits that stick out
imagine if this is used in speedrunning
"Forbidden espresso"    -John 2020, Raft
The king of exploits lmao
My mom heard your voice and without looking said, "Oh, it's that guy who does the terrible things with the building tools."
ngl you dont post enough your content is more addictive than cocaine
The satisfactory tornado has returned. Praise be.
Gray would be happy
Gracias por tu exposición
Yep
Lol it’s a Christmas tree
This is the funniest thing I've ever seen
Cool
Nice
your voice is insufferable
WE GOT #1 TRENDING IN FIVE HOURS LMAO
This, this is why it takes weeks and even months to make a video for josh
No matter what else happens, everything eventually becomes a literal game-breaking tornado.
YOU POSTED ANOTHER VID
Speedrunners will love the plank exploit
If I ever make a game, I want you as my tester
Remember adrien? How’s he going?  Is his new job going well?
Why am I not surprised...this man does the craziest things....and I freaking love it
You know what, I actually have no trouble believing you spent 2 generations finding out that safe's code by trial and error.   They said life is about dosage, balance. I guess even determination can be brought to such extents that it would open up the gates to madness.
Would love to see devs reaction video, when they watch this for the first time :D
Mr let's game it out I congratulate you on after posting one video 5 hours later it's the number one trending on gaming
can you paly it takes two?
Josh is a gift that's just keeps on giving.
where have you been? i mean im fine with this current upload schedule i just love youre videos, but do what you want im just glad you still upload
I need to ask when you Bruteforce you do it for real??
Finally! More raft!
This was so entertaining i'm still giggeling
This is just outrageous
Genuinely impressive. Worth the wait.
GRACE NO!!! NO BITING!!
#1 trending for gaming  EDIT: and #1 Trending
You know they’ll patch those planks now right?
Josh and the spiffing brit should collab
10 seconds in and i already feel like my brain is going to mush
He has come so far from the ninja bobby days.
i want to see what he can do in roblox scp-3008   its an ikea building simulator
Making game designers cry and speedruners cheer scince idk when a pretty long time
The Conveyornado he made in Satisfactory now has a spiritual successor
Caravan and Tornadoes... Is it Brickrlberry crossover ?
I'm just surprised you didn't use the horizontal beams to make an infinite raft with only four floats xD
this video is 1 on trending for gaming, congrats josh
Let's game it out he might make the world biggest raft
Someone worthy must draw some Josh plank wizard art. . .
Yay more raft
Babe wake up josh posted
😂 Finally you the best!
Damn, the man transcended humanity in the ways that god would have nightmares of
This is the new One Piece reboot.
hmm... how deep in the ocean can you go with that plank? and do the game have a hight limit? or can you just go on in either direction forever? why even bother sailing if you can build to the next objective?
If you don't remember the sharks name is grase😂😂😂
He’s out here preparing to change speedrunning forever
This !an always finds a way to not follow the rules 😂😂😂
Do Subnautica is Subnautica below zero please
🤣🤣
Finaly back, its been a while my old frend
Tornado raft giving satisfactory vibes
Awesome as always, really fun to watch. Thank you for this content :)
Raft is back less go
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. when this chaotic YouTuber posts because you always know.  E N T E R T A I N M E N T Chaos.
Plank is best toy.
Why are you like this, Josh?
The devil: “im a big fan of your work”
I wonder if people will use those planks to speedrun this game, that seems so easy to do
"Quality back in the days was so much better" - obamna
NUMBER 1 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING!!! 🥳👍
Grace!
When Josh says: "NEW GAME" in that manner it just fills you with utter excitement.
Cant get used to see Josh  do everything except play the intended way.
Even more insane than usual: 10/10
812403rd
Genius
I watch so much lets game it out that when anything goes wrong I immediately find somebody called grace to blame
at this point Josh should be hired to test games
And now I want to build an underwater raft, fortify the four parts on the surface and never bother about the shark again.
Congrats on getting number 1 in gaming
I was waiting so much for a new Raft episode, thank you Josh 😻
Satisfactory devs welcoming Raft devs as Josh claims another tornado victim..
28:14 I like the 2 padlocks are protecting a flimsy bamboo door, yeah that'll keep burglars out
josh play whos your daddy
The string lights actually make it look good
The first survivor: oh a friendly face Josh: not really
Josh makes some quality content… and some nightmares when he breaks the games.
One of the best videos you've ever made! Absolutely hilarious!
#1 on gaming not suprised
I feel like Teardown might be a LGIO game.
You should play ark with df
that end guy was a boss
"9 hours later" 1 Hours Building it  8 Hours Admiring it.           If u need to Test ur game for  Bugs Josh is  perfect  for it he will die anything but play the game how u should.

Ngl as much as I love watching him break the game, I kinda wanted to see him play through some of the story, at least in the last chapter, or at least explore the last chapter
"Hmm, I wonder why Josh hasn't posted a video in a month." *watches video* "Understandable, have a nice day."
Tell me why...
The devs are probably sobbing while watching this video
You should play Sapiens next
when will satisfactory come back update 5 and 6! plz bring back 1 fps gameplay
Dude wtfuou don’t make anymore videos anymore what do you like have a life now bro?
This was worth the wait 😌
The developers will need antidepressants after watching this!!
Ah yes, madness at it’s finest. 👌🏼
I didn't know they added people to this game with the new update
man i miss the old base
You have to appreciate the amount of time he take in games to make absolute horrors to society
Did anyone else think satisfactory whwn they saw the thumbnail
this board bit killed me! Phenomenal video!
Alternative Title: Raft speedrun with glitches
So if you wanna play another rap game after this because if you do it actually actually throws up this other raft game
Well, I think companies would pay you a loooooot of money to work for them as a software tester
How would you like your raft sir.  Like the 1998 windows screensaver 'pipes' please
Really happy to see a new video 😀
Josh is one of those people if they say multiple hours later U know its actually multiple hours
Aaaaaaaa
He did indeed completely break the game with one simple trick
Today is my birthday and this is the best birthday gift ever omg
This video is so awesome. Best one of your videos yet and I have seen them all!!
I knew you were gonna use the planks
I can't believe that I pretty much binged this entire channel in a week without realising.
69 likes perfect
I think this is my favourite LGIO episode, and not only because I just played it some days ago, but because it's so over the top crazy and game breaking, the madness so far beyond my wildest dreams, it brings tears of joy to my eyes.
Markiplier: I’m the captain now  Letsgameitout: this game is mine now
the cruise ship is some sorta speedrunning trick im conviced
JOSH IS BACK
Already liked the vid even if i did not saw it yet cause every josh content is just perfection
PHEW I WAS WORRIED I WASENT SUBBED TO YOU
Only Josh would
It's not an episode of Raft if Josh doesn't jump off of a high place and say "You're fine"
The amount of time Josh dedicates to making insane things like this is admirable.
Josh: "That's okay, we didn't want to expand too quick, did we? Duly noted... We'll keep the raft small."  *FAMOUS LAST WORDS*  *Josh proceeds to create a huge wooden tornado raft and break the game!*  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please tell me Josh has devs asking him to go ham and break games.
What did u say ”shark friend” she's name is grace
Hi
this for some reason actually lagged my pc too
This may have been the most ridiculous video i've ever watched, and i loved every minute of it.
Lol
Hekk yea I waited a whole month for this, the wait was worth it
can we just aprecatie the fact he got al of those boards
can i follow your video as a raft tutorial?
Pacifist run........great work xD
You know something is going on when Josh replicates his tornado from Satisfactory in any game!
OMG Josh we can not leave you alone with any game.
Gives a whole new meaning to walk t he plank lmfao
Love when he says “give me a few minutes” and then the “9 hours later” pops up
Its been years since the last one...   Finally inner peace
The tornado reminds me of the conveyor belt cocoon in its prime
Please never stop making content. This is beautiful
Want to see more raft in the future, because of they new update.
this is probably one of the best raft videos you have made.
More Raft yay
wow
This just makes me miss the cacophony that was Satisfactory
Ah yes my favorite raft player
30 minute video???? Josh, you're too kind
Was kinda hoping you'd name the shark grace again
this is straight up Wile E. Coyote logic....
Everybody gangsta until josh start to ride detailed plank
this was beautiful
Epic as always...im sure its all fixed by now haha.
Josh in every game he plays: “there’s just one thing missing from this quaint yet beautiful landscape, a tornado building”
I love these vids lmfao
Bring back Grace!
I love how he always finds a way to bring the game to its limits. Its quite fun to watch.
What a perfect ending!
I love how you technically played the game, without ACTUALLY playing the game 😂
Let’s go more raft!!!!!!
Can't stop watching and enjoying every second in josh's videos, thanks dude you always cheers my day
Finally🎉
Conveyor tornado...  Raft tornado... :D
It's like a mystery surprise, you never know what Josh is breaking next :)
This was one of favourites so far. Amazing
another common W of a video
Doors aren't an obstacle for Josh, they're a suggestion.
wow
Guys I think our boy Josh might be doing a little cheaty cheat !
satisfactory veiwers haveing flashbacks to the tornado
When i see a new video i MUST click on it
I love how u making a 30 vid lp in on vide xd
fun fact: in the radio tower, in the bottom floor, there is a graffiti from someone that says "i killed a shark, named it bruce" wich is a reference to jaws (the name of the animatronic is bruce) or nemo (the name of the great white is bruce)
After seeing his whole channel I need to see this man in Minecraft imagine what he would do
This is what we’ve been waiting for!
Does he do this on his own? or does he cheat? couldnt find anything about it on the internet.
Hell yeah!!! He is back!!!
727 AT 15:25 WYSI WYSI 727 omg
amazing video
welcome to the comment section, where so far we have E, f*** me, and people wanting to make games for josh to break. enjoy your time here!
Olaf not only learned how to teleport, but he used his skills in magic to create a wizard army
how can you able to identify the glitch on every game you abuse 🤣....
Jesus you are just too funny, love the videos!
I LITERALLY LIVE FOR THESE VIDEOS
finally a video
josh can you post more videos
You forgot to pick up the rhino shark trophy
Pull a satisfactory and make the tornado a cocoon
First thing I thought of when seeing the tornado raft.... The Mighty Monarch!!!
this video is going to be going down in letsgameitout history, along with the sims video where he trapped thousands of people in his home.
More long videos please
6:12 this reminds me of far cry
I feel bad for shogo lol
Government! You need to listen to me! Yes I know that you are watching this. Please whatever you do, you need to make sure this guy never finds anything that can ignore our general laws of physics. Please, he will destroy the the time, space and reality.
I LOVE this length of video Josh.  perfect lengths
Why do people make stuff that can go all over the place when they have to know he'll find creative ways of using it??!! LOLOLOL. I love how he finds ways around things he is supposed to do!
On one hand it was a freaking hilarious video. On the other I'm sad, that it was the last raft video.
brb, gotta roll a blunt for this one
I watched this on lunch break but the video is longer than my lunch break. Got back to work late but no regrets because Josh!
I can hear the developers crying
2:49 ooooofff
Josh is truly a man beyond gods! always something new madness to see XD oh how I wish to see the devs reaction to this video <3  it's magnificent !!
Josh should make videos with other youtubers and break games with them
im here cuz thumbnail
You make me smile every time 😌
Josh is an absolute treasure of modern youtube
7:35 lmao the NPC you tried to chop with an axe is called "Tala" (chop in Spanish)
Just a few…okay sure
Thanks josh, we may get a scary storm later so you posting helps me through it
You forgave the last boos its life lol
Hi your upload schedule is like my dad   None existed
Somebody needs to tell the devs about this video, as well as convincing them NOT to fix this
I love this game
Appreciation comment for Josh’s sanity and hours spent on videos like this just for our sakes.
aqua.. sorry plank-man :D
Awesome episode👌 Love your content!!
2011 is the date I was born
We can agree that josh is the funniest person on the planet
Oh hell no, I only saw the thumbnail and I am already getting PTSD from Satisfactory😱
Josh is a man of commitment and sheer will
thank you for the video! please try terraria some time! you can do a lot of crazy random stuff there too!
YOU ARE A MAD MAN! (love it)
I am so glad that I have already played through chapter three.
As always funny as hell
my soul needed some raft by lets game it out, Thank you
This guy has Speedrun potential
*scrolling through notifications*  *sees Let's Game It Out new video*  YESSSSSSSS
you should play house flipper, i think thats a lot like your style of games!
26:43
Oh no, Josh managed to skip all of the hijinks he could have had with the snowmobiles.
10:12 Ark raiding 101
*Likes Your Videos*
Pls
Post more
Josh, you are an amazing and incredible living creature 🤣🤣🤣
Hey josh can you make more satisfactory videos?
This guy seriously can break every game
Don't read my name!
Josh gives the lock picking lawyer a run for his money
i'm sure that's not how the olof fight was supposed to work, but i enjoyed it as the story of a man who got increasingly freaked out by an encroaching, unstoppable tendril of planks until he jumped out a window
This is why we can’t have nice things
Lol
My favorite part of the day is hearing "hey there, it's Josh"
And I am still wondering why there are only two uploads per month..
By far the best video in a long time. Hilarious.
Josh: Turns on his PC and plays raft His PC: *vrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*
Yay
A true master class in game breaking. 10/10
Josh just invented a new speed run glitch and broke not just the world record but actually The World! LMAO I laughed through the whole video what an amazing art of gaming. Bravo sir. you did it once again.
Not again!
this episode was amazing! really great job
Always the highlight of my month ❤️
oh my god josh wont stop until he finds every single glitch in every game
The Titel of the Video should be " Speedruning Raft with only one Item."
Me encanta cómo Josh no continúa desde donde lo dejó, sino que comienza desde el principio cada vez que llega la actualización.
You have to give it to the game that the frame rate is Josh-resistant.
There is never a video Josh posts, where I don’t laugh until it hurts.
A giant tornado and a raft in the same video what is this a crossover episode!?
This is very silly.
i love your videos!!!!!!!
Redbeet will never patch the planks, because nobody is insane enough to follow in Josh’s footsteps.
String lights can make anything pretty
What why person
Normal Person: Parkour's up the radio tower Let's Game It Out: I shall use wooden beams to get there
Bord
Just when I think you can’t outdo yourself you do it
This was sublime, it was peak lgio. Josh you are a treasure.
Best LGIO video ever, and I think it was worth the month long wait for it. Literally I've never seen someone break games so hard. Bravo josh 👏
There’s a snowmobile on the snow island you missed
Please have a collab whit How to Basic
I wait so long for a video like this one 😍
It's so great when Josh uploads
Tornado gang
JOSH : "AS LONG ITS WORKING"
Josh, noooooo. This is the 900th time you’ve broken a game!
the cocoon returns
Hahahaha I literally laughed all through this video! I love it!
the spooky coincidence is that Balboa island is 1976 m away
You have surpassed piñata man...everything you think breaks!
another cartoon indie whatever remove random crits
It's nice to see that we can now coexist with Grace. Truely graceful
It's so satisfying to watch you break games. 🤣
How do you find stuff like this every time
Whenever I will need to explain "outside the box thinking" to anyone, I will show them this video.
The canyon is basically like hurricane utah
Formeitnotnew
3,265th comment
Why does Josh have a strange fixation on chaos vortices?
Played by cleveland brown
It's the hurricane Josh!
6:25 in all honesty, that looks beautiful
Yourdo
Yes!!!!!!!!!!
Best content ever🤣
your back  I thought you were dead :)
Step 1. Make cool sandbox or building game. Step 2. You see people like it Step 3. You look it up on YouTube to see what people are saying about it. Step 4. You see a Let’s Game It Out video on the game Step 5. *regret.*
stop treating every game as if its minecraft XD  Developer : you cant just built your way out of problems its not how its supposed to work
The game's ability to survive Josh and not drop to negative 10 FPS or crash every 5 minutes is very impressive.
Something tells me that Josh was pretty..board
Hello josh
Bro, I'm crying. You are f'ing comedy gold
I was wondering when this would happen...
I miss when the shark was named Grace lol.
he will never play minecraft
I think the guys over at raft will need to add on to the game once they see this video...
I can only imagine how much wood he gathered to make all of those planks
no one, modern art: 6:32
Can we all just please take a moment to appreciate Josh's determination to break a game.
Spends dozens and dozens of hours building wooden tornados, insane constructions and bruteforcing passwords.  *ughs* in disgust when he actually does have to do a minor dev-intended piece of gameplay like putting in a radioactive rod.
I’ve gotta ask,,, is it exhausting talking like that? Haha very entertaining tho
You've turned you raft into some kind of eldritch wooden horror.
I spit out my damn food laughing when I seen the tornado raft 🤣🤣🤣
How much for the home office
"If I can't use it or knock it over what's the point?!"  The whole philosophy of this channel in a nutshell. Bravo, sir!
Amazing LOL Love your work.
"well i did find this door which is locked and obviously i don't have the key  ... i mean unless you count my *skeleton* key"   god i love this man
Handsome Josh is back, baby!!
I love your vids
2 things about this man 1. He's Funny 2. he has alot of time on his hands
WTF THE WORLD IS SPOOKY!!! I rewatched the old Raft video in the morning before installing it again on steam and playing for 5 hours and when I get done and get some food I sit down and see a NEW RAFT VIDEO!!! The sheer coincidence is astounding!
This man is a menace to all games, he manages to glitch or break almost every game he plays.  I wouldn't be surprised if he found a glitch in Monopoly (the board game) XD
Can you play hydronear
So happy!!!
This is the only correct way to play this game
I'm sad he didn't go all the way to the ocean floor in the middle of the ocean
The legend is back
whenever Josh uploads I just feel better than I did before. Keep up the great work Josh!❤
perfect
This video is a high point for this channel 🤣
We are so lucky that the demon inside Josh has found a safe way to express his feelings on non-existent characters, than on us irl!
This is great, you exploit it to not play it the way they want, so that we can watch instead of playing it at all.
Josh: “Give me a few minutes”  *9 hours later*
Good live Come laugh Who float sail -daily motivation
the pipes screensaver xD
more raft plz
Palletnado!
The shark?!? What happened to it being named grace?
Wow, I can't believe Josh got the true ending on his first playthrough!
woa'h
Is it just me or is does the tornado make anyone else remember his satisfactory series lol?
Grace, Grace, not "the shark", Grace!
i love this channel     (this part is for myself)                                  3,000th comment, 298,888th view, 54,480th like.
The thumbnail is 100% a danger to society.
I don’t know what I just saw lmao or why
I think OLAF wanted you to stay away because of what you could do with a detail plank
"Now that it looks like a screensaver from 20 years ago" unlocked a core memory of those multicolored pipes going across the screen.
I’ve played so much raft, yet you make it look like a brand new experience. Bravo good sir
these devs need to hire better qa testers
In the first four hours
And another amazing piece of art  Thank you Josh
I really wanna see a dev watch this and be horrified
I want to see a video of Josh narrating his everyday life
I feel a new wanted poster is about to be put up
The legend came back
And grace
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
How to break a finished game 101
Yes! More raft! :)
Ahhhh
I sense a new any% tactic...
I still can’t believe Josh hasn’t broken Minecraft yet.
Don’t the trash cubes remind you of the movie Wall-E
I love it when he says hmmmmmmm
When are they releasing raft for console it’s not like it’s a overly complicated ultra 4k HD 1080p real life simulator
Everyone needs to learn from Josh !   LMAO !!!!
Finally a video
Can we appreciate how long Josh spends just to break something?
I’ve never played a video game (well, except Donkey Kong in the 80’s. Yes, I’m THAT old🤣). Yet I really enjoy these videos so much. The narration is hilarious and I can imagine how much time he spends playing these games. I’ll bet it takes weeks to get a video like this put together. Can someone tell me if it takes as long as I think it does?
I'm sure this is what the devs intended
What the FRICK
every time he uploads is a day better than any day
The volume on this video is LOUD
Thats realy hard to reach   You have my respect
Become a game tester and say "I will intentionally break games for you to fix the bugs"
Hey will
fix the sharks love bites🤣🤣
This man's patience is absolutely legendary
It’s always a great day when a new video releases
looking for a guide for the game: the OK way figuring out the game on your own: the great way using clues from the game: the "right" way not caring about game story line and completely breaking the game beyond all recognition while spending hours after hours of building around obstacles and ignoring physics: THE BEST WAY
Ah my favorite chaos god
masochism at its prime
Mom just five more minutes
Finally something fun !
hey u could have clipped through the glass at the jelly fish part could u have not?
josh this vid was so funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣!!!
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.... That's what this reminds me of somehow.
Add lights to the tornado.
You are like a How To Basic on videogames. It starts normal, but you know what's coming
Devs: well, he's playing normally, maybe this will go nic- Josh: Can we... Devs: *sweat profusely*
Devs, please hire Josh. He needs friends.  Jk, love you Josh. But do rest up from your 120hr sessions or sth
hurricane Us lmao
Devs should hire you to test their games and push them to their absolute limits... and somehow this 30min video went by in what feels like 5 minutes.  Peak content right here ladies and gentlemen.
Every day that Josh uploads to YouTube is a good day
Just Exactly how much wood did it took XD
to think i beat this the boring way! lol Hurricane Josh is just how i remember it xD
I think josh may have a thing for tornadoes
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
So as a developer how painful is it seeing all your work being bested by a simple plank 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can’t believe he missed the skis that you can drive in the ice biome
Crazy 🤪, just Crazy.
Stand name: Josh  Power:crasher The breaker of games exploiter of glitches
I just love this man and his content. So amazing and impressive and ridiculous and hilarious. He really did spend 9 hours build a funnel? Wow
Someone needs to confiscate his planks of wood, he's too powerful 🤣🤣🤣
The only disappointing bit is that Josh never addresses Grace by her real name. What did she do to be demoted to being just 'the shark'?
Flippin a
I love to see Josh play Raft
26:43 hi josh
he has to do everything the wrong way
They say "patience is a virtue" for Josh its the only way to live.
Hearing the intro just does something. Like nostalgia but not fully nostalgia And A Feeling of chaos and satisfaction. Damnnn
man just turned on creative
i am a bit disappointed, this episode didnt have Grace - but it was still hilarious as hell!
i love you you and your content. go-to choice after the sesh
This channel is the living form of worth the wait
Screensaver from 20 years ago just wooshed me back to being a 5-year-old experiencing my first computer games ever, it was beautiful :')
Hmm that picture reminds me of some other picture
he spend insane much time even if he cheated to make this masterpiece
Josh is the description of: I prefer playing the game in the intended unintended way
Best speed run ever.
At one point I found Josh creations crazy creative and beautiful
Josh is the best QA resource I've ever seen. The game devs should be thanking him for showing them all their bugs.
He returns!
NEW VID FINALLY I WAITED A MONTH
Devs don't need to patch the game they just need to patch Josh
"Hey! A friendly face!" "Let's not go that far." 🤣I love it
Finally a new video!
Play ark.
heeeyeeeaah
This guy is just finding game breaking bugs for free, which game comapnies would probably pay testers for
do somthing with real civil engineer if you feel like it but thank for the content it was great
I've been waiting a whole year for him to do this
Babe wake up Josh uploaded
I bet i know what the next patch is!
He has to be a Beta Tester of Games XD No Game has Glitches and Bugs aufter that .
this made my day i love when u play raft
The most outdated channel
I love your content
Josh has to be a developers nightmare. Developers wife: what's wrong honey? Developer: .......detail plank....... Josh.......detail plank.......
Hey josh! Two point campus and I encourage you to play its on game pass to🎵
Grace is back reincarnated as a shark
So hear me out, can you beat raft while your raft is always anchored? Could you imagine using those boards to travel the entire ocean?
Yay new vid
Your videos really scratch that itch I can't ever seem to reach  My face lit up when I saw you uploaded. Doth my eyes bequeath me?
Could you do more lawn gnome medieval games
The sea tornado
It's Josh. Is it really Josh?! Only one way to find out~
Starting to think whenever Josh could make A tornado, HE WILL DO IT!
Run from it, dread from it. Josh’s everlasting nightmares of creations will always arrive.
"This gives me an idea." Is the one phrase you never want to hear Josh say.
Josh making speedrun tactics is simply incredible. especially since he isnt even speedrunnign the game and finding stuff that helps majorly with speedruns.
Hi
How does Josh sit through all these tedious things he does almost every video
I remember a different tornado 🌪️ that he made
Omg a New vid
Add a comment...
Madman 😂❤️
legends say: he farmed all that wood
Does anyone else think that graystillplays & let’s game it out should make a video together?
love your video dude, keep it upppp
LEST GOOOO , ANOTHER VİDEO , HAS BEEN FOREVER!!
Love your vids as always mr.Josh ♥️♥️
tell me you spawned in items without telling me you spawned in items.
i love ur vids :D itd be awesome if u could turn up the game sounds, ur voice is so much louder that i can barely hear the game. thx!
😂😂😂 👉🏻👌🏻😂😂😂
HAhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!
That brute forceing of the keyvcode was a joke right? He wouldn't sit for 8 hours just entering codes when he just could google it or solve the puzzle in far less? Right? ....right....?
727
Wait what am I suppose to do with this pretty red button? Does it torment Grace
I love your vids thank you for spending hours for these and for being funny
Is there any game that Josh cannot break?
Breaking games like this is an art form, and no one can convince me otherwise.
Give this man a sub..if u still dont
Yoo raft :)
Game devs don’t make boss fights for this man to play josh in turn, is the final boss of game developers
Hmm
Josh is the only youtuber that doesn’t lie when he says “9 hours later”
Woman: get me out of here.                                 Josh: yeah no
yep pretty sure that josh is insane at this point lol love the vid!!!
Hello and welcome to Lets Game It Out with our host Josh. In todays episode we discover advanced alien technologies, phase through solid matter as we bend the laws of the universe to suit our own will, and drown innocent people in the ocean. Thank you for stopping by, and most importantly, enjoy the show.
"Laws" of physics are more like "easily ignorable suggestions" of physics to Josh. XD
Sometimes I think that Josh is an Eldrich God and that the only reason he builds these almagalmations is to remind himself of his homeland.
I love how the tornado is more and more becoming a running gag now.
Really hope for Josh to try his hand at Evil Genius 2 and Two Point Campus, it will be awesome. 😁
You have a weird fetish with Tornados
Am I the only one who is confused why Josh doesn't call the shark "Grace" anymore? 😅
A new video!! Also I think the raft with string lights was kinda pretty, just me?
HES BACK
I now have board phobia
an half hour video. worth the wait!
once you see this 11:55 you know that you will see a nightmare
Broooio I love the sound of your intro now
16 minutes late lol
Little did we know that those string lights would be the key item in the completion of the game!
Makes Skyrim almost look balanced.
Is there a limit to how amazing these videos are? Answer: No
And this is how he’ll was formed
Oh boy my favourite, man made horrors beyond my comprehension.
"...and for that we're gonna need a NEW GAME"   So it begins...
Did you know if you press Comma you go in third person
Josh is like a bug-tester but he finds every bug in the book
I have a hard time waiting for the videos, but good God is it worth it every time!
It doesn't matter what the game devs build...... Josh always finds a way to break it
good job
Mhh yess crispy mango
6:05 hey Josh, I have a strong tingling feeling that you are familiar with Michael P.
There's always that thing that surprised me in Josh's videos. This time it was the hurricane boat. What a hoot!
If I had a quarter for everytime Josh has made a Tornado Base, I would a dollar....which is hilarious its happened 4 times now
Дааааа! Ты вернулся к этой игре! 🥰🥰🥰
I'm convinced that the developers actually hire Josh to playtest their games and a side bonus is he's allowed to "document" the process and upload them to YouTube.
Yay he’s back
You're gonna get the tornado raft as the first picture on the steam page for raft
I'm subscribed and notifications are on
the plank life
Josh u are a legend :')
i am half way throug hthe video and i already want to die
Yo play terraria
devs should hire this man as a play-tester
31:42 The simulation experience. Man is both in prison and comitting genocide.
I'M UR BIGGEST FAN EVER I'VE WHACHED ALL UR VIDEO'S AND IT'S ONLY BEEN 3 MONTHS CRAZY Right
i like how ur insanely play every game.
How veel Wood dit it teke
Ah yes more mysery
When there's a key pad and you hear him say zero zero zero zero, you know you're about to witness a feat of astounding discipline
this was the first video i didnt missed lol  but its really good
You should try rust
XD 3H AGO DEYUM
i love you
Man in a stronghold with animals traps and a belt of dynamite vs someguy with a long plank
Josh you should do speedruns I bet you will be good at it
Josh what happen to ur old friend u use to do vids with? And would he comeback
So strong and so brave
Josh you can pick up that big shark for trophy
Or Josh or whatever
Josh is back destroying another game for the devs.
Those planks just made this a "Long Horse" sumulator.
There is a reason why the Teardown dev limited the number of boards you get.
What kind of computer does the guy have
Why is this so fun to watch
Congratulations, you just turned raft into minecraft
Comment for the algorithm <3
I would honestly love watching the devs react to these videos of yours.
Olof: **Disappears** Josh: “Oh, I didn’t know I was dealing with a wizard.” Josh: **Fazes through multiple doors, ignores physics, survives multiple falls from high heights, and breathes underwater** Me: “I don’t think he knew that he was dealing with a wizard either.”  Edit: Oh my God thanks for the likes
Wow! He’s such a pro at raft
this man is a beacon of entertainment for his viewers, a game breaking monster for game developers, and an eldritch horror in games
Forbidden espresso 5:16
Never heard of this game. Can you play something that others know?
I like how josh will just say 9 hours later but just imagine him sitting in his chair building the tornado for nine hours straight.
I watched every video u make you are an awesome person
i feel like the detail plank is just the long horse of raft as long as josh is using it
It's not a wizard it's your dad
Knowing the Nightmare he always builds I can't wait to see a hellish raft amalgamation
the many ways he breaks the game
"If I cant use it or knock it over whats the point?"  -Josh 2022
LOVED THIS
This man is the definition of "If you can, do it."
Whenever u here “hi my name is Josh welcome back to let’s game it out today we are playing raft” u know u gonna see 1 frame per hour
Best game tester of our generation!
you should play firework mania
Absolutely amazing Josh. As always
I love that I could watch this and still have no more spoilers for the last chapter story than me stumbling on trophies in creative mode.
We all know josh is the real bug tester for games
Jesus Christ :D :D :D This is incredible.
He didn't mention that he beat the final boss with the help of his old friend, string-lights.
I'm honestly surprised. As soon as he found out the planks let him walk underwater, I expected "How deep can we go with this? Only one way to find out..."
Whenever Josh plays games, he’s just helping the creators find bugs
Bro plays through the entire game with just a detail plank (which takes normally soo long) and ignores all the things like puzzles, items or the story that the creators put so much effort into.  It's always so funny and cursed, which is why i love your content so much! 😂
Insaine dude. Insaine.
Cool
I found your channel when I was bored to tears as a school custodian. Stuck with ya ever since.
make a underwater base.
When he went brute force on the password I imagine the devs were just like "Hehe, I'm in danger"
bro you have a horrible mic
Glad your back
Let’s gooooooo! More raft
what a great video!
Yes yes yes yes
My guy! Made my day.
just the little bit of sequence breaking
you forgot the snowmobiles at the snow island
and in this video, josh attempts to re-create the tower of babel
This is the only video in which I can tell what he's gonna do next, atleast most of the times.
i missed raft
*bords
Where are all the birds coming from
Holy crap this is hilarious!
17:24 "I'm ok, thank you !" *Looks at the raft* ... Are you, though ?
Did u call the the shark shark friend where is Grace
the conveyer to wood tornado
You should play breakwaters
Can you play the Universim and make a video about it?
What happened to grace?🥲
Graase is shork
And they say he is there till this day
Ohhh myyy goddd... The thumbnail alone 😁😅🤘
The poor game developers... lol
You are creating art just by playing the game ! And I'm 100% sure that nobody in this world played it the same way..
Somehow i can hear the developers crying 😂
You can go up zip lines! If you spam the button to jump on and off of it, you can go up faster than it sends you down
Fun fact: Those 4 digit padlocks have 10,000 possible combinations (10^4)
19:18 guess I'm stopping here, cos I don't want spoilers.  I'll come back to this one in about a year, after I get round to finishing the game.
Well, I’d almost given up hope on more Raft, but it was definitely worth the wait.
You're absolutely insane and I love it.
Ofcourse you broke it
hey josh satisfactory has an update with nukes
Josh, if you were fine with brute -forcing a 4-digit safe code, why didn't you just brute-force the 4-digit coordinates?
...I'm gonna hope that Josh being from Florida is cannon.
I wonder if he uses mods to make it easier
i dub they Plank Walker
The fact that he forgot that the actual receiver has to be higher like his other play through the raft
im kinda on time yaaay
Some men see things as they are, and say why. Josh gets a plank and says why not and breaks the game.
4:54 How did you get vine goo before you unlocked the smelter??
pirates of the Caribbean: defying physics
My goshhhh I have been waiting for your upload for so long man  Glad you're back with a new video 🥺
I'll leave this comment here for people to let me know if the developer commented on this video. thanks in advance. if anyone wants to get notified add comment.
the conveyor tornado now has a brother
Josh is good at bug testing but he doesn't even mean too find them on purpose
Tala: "Hey, a friendly face!" Josh: "Let's not go that far..."
Hi
14:07 The moment when you realize that physics and rules no longer have power all of you.
you really are one of my favourite youtubers  great work as always stay blessed
Where did you go you havent been posting latley
LMAO
Couldnt you clip through the wall like you did with the radio tower?
Best let’s game it out video
Idk if anybody will see this but boog
This man and the spiffing Britt needs to collaborate
7:08 187 🐊🐊
I actually did the pain of what was Utopia's puzzles, so seeing Josh just walk past 800 quests is really, REALLY funny.
30:40 I love how the general guy is just absolutely terrified as Josh menacingly advances towards him on a magic plank bridge.  Also Josh’s string light obsession saved the guys life
Walk da plank!
He said that it just came out in the intro. That tells you how much time he spent on this.
12:13 The first artificial typhoon that probably will destroy anything on impact, made by none other than Josh. I mean considering he made a shotgun launching people in the past, this is nothing.
Oh my god, this ending with him casually bombing the town while absolutely no one cares could not be more perfect.
Josh is the ultimate game tester to be honest. He will find a way to break a game. Which from Hydroneer definitely seems to be a helpful input. Considering the last money glitch doesn’t work anymore
Oh finally
Game devs: We have over 200 hrs of gameplay on a open world map for you to expl- Speedrunners/meme players: there's 3 actually...
the company that made raft should hire josh as a tester for new updates, mainly cause he always finds bugs
VERY NICE
Day 1 of asking Josh to collaborate with graystillplays  Edit: also day 1 of asking Josh to play the Sims again
Is anyone else sceptical that Josh actually tried the safe over 5000 times
so excited you uploaded, also the raft videos are amazing, well done!
I'm sorta early
How about Josh tries College tycoon or something like that (I don't really remember the name)
Wow, this is like a speed run strat, just skip everything and just go to the objective with detail planks lol
Yes! Josh is back!
This is exactly what I needed today.
The longer the upload schedule takes, the better the video could be..
I am always so hyped when i open up YouTube and see a new video from Josh
when others post i rejoice when you post i cautiously click the video and hope i don't regret it
Literally right at the beginning there's a jumpscare
your videos are just the best, always a joy to watch
genuinely always makes me laugh 😂
This guy is so entertaining but the bad thing is he uploads like 1 or twice if we are lucky please upload more!
The thumbnail made me say   OH NO…
Oh man, this was one helluvva salty seadog adventure. LMFAO Josh, properly smashed it this time 🤣😂
Josh making game developers regret giving their players new things yet again.
I want to see Josh play modded minecraft, the insanity he could unleash in it would be amazing
How did you completly break the game with one custimization tool, discovered by accident? This is god tier game play
6:01 Josh making designs of what architecture might look in a couple hundred years probably.
You forgot graces nqme
hi josh
bro josh should become a bug tester
This guy is single handedly creating hundreds of beta tester jobs, it's amazing.
Core memory unlocked: The pipes screensaver for windows
Josh what have you done? You have found a bug the dev is sure to fix it. Run lads use it while you can
"The door is locked from the other side"  Josh: I missed the part where that's my problem
You know this video is going to be good when he doesn't upload in months 🤣🤣
just a heads up, Satisfactory got some new toys to play with...  looking forward to that video :D
Forbidden espresso
His raft looks like a Trevor Henderson monster
This is outrageous. Poor Grace has just been reduced to “The Shark.”
the shark is no longer grace...
Let’s goooo news viiddd thank you so much!!
Don’t tell him about minecraft
0:49 NAHHHHH THAT SHARK IS SPAWN FROM HELL I CAN SEE THATS SMILE MAN
Josh: “It doesn’t have to connect to anything?”  His PC: Oh dear god no please no
No game can run from “J.O.S.H.”
Man this guy and tornadoes
that raft should be on a displate
Wow this was a glorious followup for this magnificent game! I enjoyed every minute! Thank you.
long time no see
Everytime Josh smiles a game becomes more broken and unstable.
I hope you people have all been impatiently waiting for Sir Josh to post another monstrosity of a video.
Always fun to get a new vid even if its 30 mins
Thank you for coming back to raft I’ve been waiting for years for this
BRUHHHHH HAHAHHAHAHA
Ah, LGIO, you always upload unexpectedly.
Watch this strat make its way into the speed run
How good is this guys pc!?!?
Lengend. he spends so much time to make his videos perfect its insane
someone PLEASE send this to Raft devs haha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wait what 3 hours ago
Yes
2.9kth
is this the alternate ending?
POV: You make a channel dedicated to break games and frustrate developers
3hours, 50k likes
He did indeed brake the game. With one item.
The developers of raft after hearing josh say "Its time for some raft": "please no dont break our game again".
A nice crunchy landing 24:13
Raft developers: wtf is he doing
Hi first time in 1st day love the content keep it up
Thank god for the planks.. Not using those pesky feet of yours
Haha omg love it 😂 I would always love to see the developers of the game watching your videos and be like "...omg...how?...why? Do we need to fix that?" 🤣
How did that guy learn to do mgic so well? He's gotta teach me or something
My top 3 relaxing YouTubers:  Josh GrayStillPlays EasySpeezy
lol
Can you please make a Minecraft video or another cooking simulator video
After watching another youtuber play through this game and no-clip through the roof I can't wait to see what Josh does (and if this video doesn't have him no-clipping I'll be mildly disappointed) Edit: Cool
I'm not sure if this is obvious to everyone, but he's gotta be playing in creative mode right? Like how in the hell did he get that much wood?
It looks like brawls meta knight tornado
Josh: "hey everybody. Welcome to lets game it out" Every game he has: *OH GOD NO-*
finally a new video
Josh has speed running tactics.
Babe wake up new let's game it out video
thanks for the raft walkthrough!
Raft but not
Thank you for doing God's work and putting all those hours for a few of my chuckles. Keep up the good work, I deserve this laughter. 👏
Oooooo i’m so exited
he missed out on the snowmobiles
Fun
play scrap mechanic
With how much Josh breaks games, he'd make a great beta tester.
Josh is one of the most patient man alive
try and post sooner ok.
Every game he plays he breaks
Josh: give me a few minutes.     Video: 9 Hours later (MAYHEM)
the time he took a key through the window... damn. That wasn't even a "glitch" or insane exploitation, just a design oversight, but oh so satisfying
This man has so much patience
You should play Astroneer again beacause it released a new update: The Rails Update
Finally a video
I appreciate the hours he spent into making this turnado. Beautiful
finally a new vid
I really want to see devs reactions to these videos. :D
23:23..
It's been forever since you made a video
He didn't use the snowmobile
game developers should use him as a bug/glitch finder
Ah, man made horrors beyond my comprehension.
I wish I had that much willpower
YOU MISSED THE SNOW SCOOTERS
YOOOOOOOOOOOO I WAS WAITING SO LONGGGGGGG I LOVE YOU JOSH.
The Tornado Raft are giving off some strong Satisfactory vibes 👀
You made a beautiful nightmare tree!
Game Developer: I have spent years creating my dream. I have all the bugs out. Josh: Hold my beer *MANY HOURS LATER* Game Dev: What did he-, how did he-, he's not supposed to-... OKAY! THAT NEEDS TO BE PATCHED!
Are you ok take a break holy cow that’s a lot of building
i am happier now
I wonder how long it'll be before raft fixes all the things Josh found
I never know what to expect with josh's videos, but it is always more hilarious and satisfying than it should be. This was the perfect finale to RAFT! lol
finally an upload
Josh: hmmm, let's play with.... gamedevs, watching his videos: take notes, take notes!
never dissapointed
This was fantastic, everything I wanted and more
Oh, geez. This is probably the most broken you've made this game yet. Holy hell! :)
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Yay! So glad to see your still making content... took so long in between videos I almost unsubbed lol. This game was a heck of a gem. Love the way you played it. 😁 looking forward to more
7:40 Girl: hey, a friendly face!! Me: he is by no means friendly Josh: lets not go that far
I’ve been waiting this video for over a year now, and I’m beyond happy to see this now
you should play the mortuary assistant for a change, super spooky, if not the spookiest game in the world
yes. detail planks go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Josh is turning into Franky during the Thriller Bark arc
i wish he  would have stollen a snowmobile cause I'm sure he could break a few things wit  it like shoving t threw wal;ls to drive inside building ect
where's the double like button
My daughter and I were watching this because we love your videos, and when you jumped down to the mayor's house and snapped your ankles, my daughter said with you "you're fine" because we both know your videos so well and knew what you were going to say lol
The ultimate bug finder, except they never seem to stop coming
Mans built the monster from Nope
plz upload more vds
My favourite gamer
yaay a new lets game it out video!! time to sit back and enjoy the mayhem <3
Devs: Oh god dammit we Just FINISHED PATCHING THAT!!
The best grinder in any game
Its only fun when josh plays raft or satisfactory. it clears my mind and gives me -2 iq
OMG. I love the old Josh. I wonder how would the devs react watching this?
Why was my first thought at 6:15 that the thing that was missing was string lights as well? Should I be concerned? XD
I feel like if Josh got really serious then he could be a decent speed runner
I want to see a speedrun of this now
The fact he js exploiting is crazy
try minecraft
I love your videos Josh, it's insane how you find every way to destroy every game you play 😄 🤣 😂
When Josh plays The floor is lava. He's definitely the winner.
havent seen this guys vid in 1 year and comeback to this
Let's game it out for 24 hours:D
Josh would be the one to save the world on Doomsday tbh
Have you played “Wobbledogs”? It’s a game where there are ‘Dogs’ that you can evolve and mutate into monsters beyond human comprehension that have thousands of legs and three heads. 10/10 game, and hours of my life have been taken
Tbh  I would also be reasonable scared of the omnipotent being riding through creation on boards towards me. Pointing at me. Judging me.
why the mods i know u have mods since the... yes i have mods too so yea
If the game devs watch this someone’s getting fired😂
late
Goddamn, I needed the smile that seeing you posted a new video brought me.
When I think if Josh and raft there are just so many things that he could do to make a basic game crazy really fast
🪓🧍🤣
29:08 that laugh...
he should do a collab
how did he get so much wood
Uuuuhhhhhhgggg
we really need some "react to LGIO" videos from all the Devs ^^
I have awaited this for so long
He must have been grounded many times because he spends 999999999999999909 years on great success
When josh says let’s builds something nice just run
How did you make an entire tornado with that:O
With Josh creating a tornado in Satisfactory and now in Raft, I'm convinced that it's his goal to create a tornado in every game he plays.
Please this be a normal play through . With josh from letsgameitout no way
I can hear developers crying
I see that nobody reacted to the Celine Dion joke. Hats off Josh, you're an absolute God.
If you loted big mama shark you've would have been happy af
спасибо
30 minutes Josh?!?! Thank you!
the thumbnail reminds me of satisfactory
Part 2 pls
Josh seemed board this episode
Giving Josh any game will result in him breaking it somehow
I love the fa t it is handling that better than your tornado in Satisfactory
I'm always impressed of how Josh always breaking reality wherever he goes
over my dead body of planks 🤣
The first Lgio I watched was the second Raft video so I'm pretty excited for the new one
I love your videos Josh, they make my add brain happy with all the unbridled chaos and honestly doing the same kind of stupid gamebreaking garbage I think of, but dont have the patience for
"Just a few minutes"  *took 3 generations to do it
With the final chapter out I was wondering when he was gonna break it again
I like how when you get off of the outhouse, you jump into the air
Correct
I love how much enthusiasm there is for everything you do
The only flaw on this video is that you never called the shark "Grace", lol
I love how this has shown that it's actually the ingame world bobbing around rather then the raft. Wouldn't have thought of that, but it's such an easy and good way to implement that.
Developers : With all those puzzles, I believe it will take more than 10 hours for players to complete this game  Josh : well, yes but no
Haven´t seen the newest update of Raft yet, delightfull video like always tho
Man, this might be one of the best videos of yours so far: silly game breaking, finishing a series (?), funny as always and it's a whole half-hour long!
"gimme a few miinutes" *9 hours later*
Josh full on broke physics, props to him
"HEy there its josh" oh boy here we go again.
Raft devs after seeing this video be like:   Thats not the intended way this should work but eh.. we will just patch it that you cant build underwater anymore.
Oh no, next epizode isn't Satisfactory? Raft can be, right?🥲  My god, my mental health is ded after this video :D
Josh: jumps from orbit onto something  *”your fine”*
Raft accidental speedrun feels so satisfying
gj you are uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yeah, you're back
man it would suck to have this guy go camping with you to hear him in that voice complaining about how you are not camping right  i can hear it now 😨😨
I was waiting for this game video 👀
Josh doing the catchphrase. Developer: "WRITE THAT DOWN! WRITE THAT DOWN!"
Yay 2 h ago
Can I please play raft with you that’s all I have to say and also keep up the lovely and great work
You know you're in for a GREAT TIME when Josh uploads :) The only one unique youtuber gamebreaking for fun of his and ours[seriously,i could not find anyone similar to him]
It’s newtopia not utopia
You're the tester every dev loves and hates at the same time
Josh should become a game tester with the amount of things he manages to break lmao
You are a genius! Thanks for this! 👏🙌
Detail plank=legit hack Fastest Speedrun of this game
wow
Yes yes and a million more times YES
Raft character*breaking legs* Josh: ya hear that? Its the sound of LOVE CRAKS
Honey! Let's Game It Out just posted! Set up the fine China while we watch!
Can the pooper noclip through walls too?
Yet another tornado.
NOT AGAIN, OH F- WHY DO I LIVEEEEEEEE
I would love to have the persistence Josh has
I absolutely hate you for that cheeky boss battle dad joke.
I think if I was a developer and Josh tested my game, I'd either be very excited or utterly horrified 😂
origin of longhorse
I bet the speedrun for this masterpiece is absolutely WILD
The raftnado is giving me some serious Upside Down vibes when it's spinning
Yay he’s back
I'm not sure if Raft sponsors these videos out of misplaced optimism, or if Josh just takes it upon himself to show them how broken every iteration and update of their game is. Either way, they are not listening, and I love that.
They added trains to astroneer
i bet the dev wasn't expecting josh abuse  the details plank system
Wish you would post more videos on YouTube more often 😕
The raft tornado is giving me Satisfactory Flashbacks 🤣
I thought the shark name's Grace
You should try the game "My Summer Car". There are so many things you can break.
The fact than a man can paddle a comically large boat is just absurd. Josh can defy the laws of physics if he wanted too
Josh, this is not a mild suggestion. It's a spicy suggestion. Please play Subnautica and/or Subnautica Below Zero! I love that game and would personally watch your Subnautica videos over and over.
the god has spoken once more
Another awesome video!!! Can you do a video where you actually play the game correctly?
Yo
Why didn't you let those NPC's come with you?  Didn't even know that this was in the game.  Didn't you want them as besties?  Invite them and all they do is sit around, eat all of your food and complain while you do all the work. Kind of like a girlfriend/wife is.
Anyone remember when let's game it out had two people?
he playing fortnite😩😩😩😩😩
cool
No joke, your <<tornado>> looks sick
25:20 OMG Josh.. I lost it ATM 🤣🤣🤣
2.7kth comment  or something like that
Happy to see Josh and Grace again!!
Josh, you're the ultimate Beta tester.  New word = "Verticality"
*A blessing from the gods!*
I'm still impressed by the way he breaks the game, even though I watch all of his video. And absolutely did not expect the tornado lol
Legendary channel
I wish I had the patience of this man when he was pressing the buttons to open a safe.
By far, Without question, the most entertaining channel on YouTube, Thanks so much for the great content josh!
10:30 I can’t believe you seriously clipped through a wall I did not know that was posssible in this game
Aha...so this is why most of these games have a building stability feature.
Raft
I’ve been so long since you’ve made more videos about
Yay.
When ever the guy jumps off and "respawns"  Josh :- "Oh! you are fine."
Play 2 Point Campus next!
I cant believe you. You didn’t call the shark grace!
I just wanted to be one of the first people to watch i wonder if anyone will reply to this
Redbeet Interactive: "We have spent years creating this deep crafting/survival adventure, including many puzzles, complex resource management, and a dictator you must defeat at the end." Josh: "plaaaaaaaaank"
I know everyone has been waiting for this
It's alway amazes us the things Josh does and developers too I'm sure
"hey a friendly face."  "I wouldn't go that far."
12:04    *satisfactory flashbacks*
That ending was one of the most game-breaking beauties ever
This was a great way to celebrate the end of my first day of school.
6:35 r/bossfight
I don’t think it’s possible to hate LGIO
given enough time and a "Don't do this" or "this is the correct way since Josh can do anything
as someone who has played through the game i was both confused and frightened when he said was looking forward to the detail plank
My eyes! My Sanity!
JOSH I MISSED YOU
Hi the Devi- josh
Did anyone notice that the toilet seat hole looks a bit like a face?
I love how much effort he puts in just to give us a good laugh we love you josh
This must be the best way to play this game
Finally, Josh!!! :D :D :D
Anybody else want to see Let's Game It Out record with The Spiffing Brit. One of course being The Master Game Breaker the other The Master Game Exploiter.
YEEES NEW VID
I generally hate "reaction" videos. . . but the whole elevator bit got me wishing for a video of the devs watching this and commenting. LOL
hi let’s game it out thx for posting again
Bro the dedication
Speedrunning tactics!
this reminds me of that one episode of spongebob
Josh breaks the game to the point it crashes Resets game Josh: Wanna see me do it again?
21:10 was that a lego city undercover reference?
19:04 you can’t fool me Josh. That was obviously Grace, and you strapped her to that chair because she actually had a bigger raft than you.
beautiful ❤️
I love raft
can you imagine if josh became president, because he would solve the country's problems in a different way LOL... What a legend👏🔥
this guy would make  the best beta tester
Josh, has it been so long since you played raft, you forgot the sharks name was grace?
Developers: we have patched lots and lots of stuff from your previous endeavors josh!! Meanwhile josh: plank go brrrr
Play BTD6 (day1)
josh theres a door in utopia which literally skips everything if you can force your way in you skip everything and get the key little tip
I love these videos actualy missed you
damnnnnnn
"This will only take a minute"...*9 hours later* 🤣 I will never get bored of game-breaking on this level...
“The door is locked from the other side” Josh: I’m sorry you feel that way 😂😂😂
I have bleeding eyes now
If RLM and Josh did a collaboration, I think I'd achieve nirvana.
Why build a town on skyscrapers and make a floating dirt platform when there are dozens of large variable islands?
Mmmm, this was tasty, thank you josh!
I am continually amazed and amused by the amount of time and craziness Josh uses to break each and every game he comes into contact with. Definitely one of the best channels on the Youtubes
hello
At this point Josh is an SCP to game developers
2 hours 200,000 veiws 2000 commets
How much wood did you had to grind for for all those planks?
oh no not another tornado.
Can't imagine the devs reaction after seeing this. Lmao.
I'll have to play this game, I love videos like this that show how to break the game, so I know how much I'd be missing out on if I did! Thanks YouTube gamer man!
they have given him to much power
Josh: makes confusing nightmare structure Mother nature: "Note to self shark isn't work fast enough need more sharks to destroy ummm ... WHATEVER THAT IS"
Beautiful
One if the best Script Error love it
He really did go through every single possible number for a code 🧍
devs should hire him to try and find normal items, and break the game with them
You can't convince me he is not a senior software tester in a big tech company
Simply gold content!
If only gamedevs asked more often "What would Josh do?". But they don't so we have Josh asking "Can I get away with this?"  Yes, yes you can you marvelous psychopat.
This has to be the most epic bastardization of a video game ever!
Can't wait for "I telepathically broke the game with doing nothing"
Can u play spore you can make abominations like you do with other games and take over the world and the universe I don’t know how you never played it
I am both delighted and irritated by his approach to this game. So much sequence breaking, so much tedious resource gathering. I know why, but why? Just. Why?
Play stardew valley
Hehehaw
Game Developers have a bitter sweet relationship with Josh 😅
At this point, Josh’s signature thing should be, “Can I make a tornado out of something in this game?” First the beltnado in Satisfactory, and now Raft. What game will be next?
That's one way to break it xD
First
The fact that he brute-forced a 4-digit lock but not brute-forced 4-digit coordinates
Eee
Oh yes my daily does of destruction
Xd
I literally looked 5 hours ago that I haven't accidentally missed one of your videos 🙈 Now there is one. Coincidence? I don't think so!
Lol
Petition to make josh team up with developers and record their reactions
this man is a menace to game devs
If oyu can build up in a game, he's always going to make a tornado.
Why this might be close to what you did with satisfactory
Raft finally added the sea bear!
You need to do an episode in ark: survival evolved! (You can build bases on brontos and quetzels)
Yooooo new vid
Introducing Sharknado: The Game
At this point i'm convinced that Josh is on top of most wanted list in every game development studio.
welcome back
FIANLY YESSS
Thanks for posting  today I needed it.
He speed runs game on accident
What we just witnessed was Josh transcending to the level of Super Saiyan.
I love how he might have beaten the world record for beating the game
Josh: I’m sure there’s a puzzle but I prefer my way *tries every combination*  Jeez man, u don’t have to torture ureself
Oh god, it's Valheim all over again.
Guess the first update includes an item removal lol
Late for 2 hour
So Josh is just Franky if he decided he didn’t need any help to get the One Piece. Got it.
Grace is just trying to protect the environment from the threat known as “Josh” though he is known by many other names….
You are amazing
the g is for grace, isn't it
Pov your playing the floor is lava with Josh: "Josh! The floor is LAVA haha lol xd......... ok now that's cheating"
Whenever he just posted this video I’m like “hm, ok I’ll watch it” then I see how long it is “YEEEEESSSSSSS YEEEEESSSSSSSS”
Phenomenal.
this man is the reason the word torture exists
They are going to patch a lot of things now. Might as well enjoy it while we can.
The way i looked at this video on my reccommended and was completely unphased says alot about what josh is doing to our brains
did he forget the shark's name is grace?
19:17 She saw too much. Because she saw the act of Josh phasing through the glass, she had to be prevented from telling anyone.
a few minutes = 9 hours for josh
11:50 When he said "9 hours later"... I believe that.
Someone tell me
The man has WAYYYY To meny pactions "How meny numbers are we talking" 1111 "four ok" "0001, 0002" A Few moments later he got the code WHY AND HOW?!?!?! lol
I’ve watched your videos for years and the never cease to amaze me
AH IM SO GLAD THERE'S A NEW VIDEO
I’ve been waiting for this for so long
This is the best LGIO episode I’ve ever seen, the amount of time this must’ve taken is absolutely ridiculous, this man never ceases to amaze and entertain us by breaking games in the most unfathomably bizarre method possible.
These videos are always amazing.
200k views in 2 hours, damn son... no wonder he doesn't make many video's anymore 😔😭🤣🤧
I swear. The 4 past vids I have come to look to see if you had posted and then the next day you do!! It's getting crazy Josh! 🥰
im pretty sure Josh is the only YouTuber we can believe when it comes to "9 hours later:" etc XD
Josh is like the Frozone of driftwood.
Your videos keep keep me alive.
It's amazing how Josh breaks this game.
Next time try 2 build a raft on 1 foundation and have pillars keep up the rest of the raft
Wait what is th3 game called I forgot
2500 th
Naahhh... Your fine😂😂😂
The tornado is back!
day 1 of asking josh to play people playground
I think that he s the perfect play tester , he discovers all the glitches in one playthrought
what about the shark named grace
"hey a friendly face!" "lets not go that far"
lov de vids but, are u ok?? just how long did this take?💕
How nice with a 32 minute video
Gotta love how Josh builds a tornado in every game he can.
"And now it's time to expand." No, it's time to play "is there a limit" to how many boxes you can fit on your raft.
The "tornado" raft 🤣🤣🤣
This has third person
and they thought the game was ready to be launched bugs free.
RIP Grace
Syukuran karena ada video baru untuk menemani kita
After seeing this creators of this game are in coma.
Even if it isn't genuine, that wouldn't make it worse
Omg! The tornado raft is just like his tornado conveyor from Satisfactory 🤣🤣☺️
The happiest time in my life is when you posted a video 😅
this guy is too underrated
make another planet zoo video
Is that Noah´s Ark? is that a tornado? no, its just Josh Joshing
I feel bad for you
Man he must be depressed to make videos.
I am late for two hours
josh out here building scaling puzzles/ radio towers putting ubisoft out of business
OH YES! A new video!!!!!!
According to legend, the shark's name is... GRACE.
Nothing like a new Let's game it out raft video in the afternoon
I just wanna see the devs watching this man's videos in horror as he proceeds to decimate their game.
Detailed plank is surely going to be removed after this monstrousity 🤣🤣🤣. Frekin Loved it💕💕
He was playing floor is lava the entire time by himself
A great example of man’s disdain for the natural order and how we create unholy abominations just to spite Mother Nature.
Play astroner again they added trains
Amazing!
You just know when it fades to white like 10 hours have probably gone by
I love how he took so mant tries to open the safe in the ice part
I'm glad satisfactory could join us in Raft
This game is an example of a stranded person with too much time on their hands.
Glitches that should not be fixed phasing
Just like Bobby Drake using his ice bridge sled but with wood!
👌
Love watching you brake games so dam funny🤣
THEY UPDATED PLANET CRAFTER AND YOU STILL HAVE NOT CRASHED IT    And pls do subnautica
Josh can make any game entertaining 😆👏
Im still shocked he didn't call the shark Grace
Your best video so far. Love it!
Best YouTuber ever
Im in The first hour love all your vids and and love your channel
you find the exploits in games like hairs on your head so easily
“Oh man I’ve just spent years making a game I can’t wait to watch everyone discover new ways to play it 😁😁”  “Hey there it’s Josh, welcome back to let’s game it out “  “😧”
OHH JOSH,  YOU NEVER FAIL TO AMAZE ME 😂😂😂
He accidentally found out about a speed run glitch and used it to fool around, amazing. I love him
The ending was amazing, thanks for the laughs. Josh!
Perfect way to progress through the game with minimal spoilers
Did josh just turn Raft into a minecraft play through using god bridging? Lmao
E
amugus fortnite
The floor is lava challenge Completed.
Wow he just exploits everything in the game
Whenever Josh says something along the lines of "Oh, wait a second, can we..." you can be sure the answer will be "Yes" and you also can be sure that he will find a way to exploit this fact beyond belief.
Omg this srsly stupid 🤣
Silver Surfers brother the board surfer
Missed opportunity where he could’ve said “Dive in” instead of “dig in”
No 1 tell josh he can phase thru sitting on a chair
When I am sad you make my day great again Thysm I love your Videos
Im just suprised he hasn't taken the mayor hat
I love when games are open in this way!
Oh no, not again!!!
As multiple people said in his comment section,"he is a great playtester for finding bugs"
its a boat its a ship no,   it's lets game it out
Cyberpunk could've used some of Josh's skills before launch
Been a while since he did one of these. Love it 👍
Bro is probably running dual 6950xt 💀
Josh’s boat teetering under the bucket tower: Panik It’s fine: Kalm A shark eats it: Panik
i can show you the world. i can show with my planks
Master plan
too contrivesial🧐🧐
This is a strategy
I feel like Josh gets half of his games for free just so the developers can find all the bugs
i love all of your videos and id wish you could upload more but im guessing because of all the love and care you give to editing your videos i doubt theyd come more frequently without decreasing in quality. keep up the amazing work josh!
🤣🤣🤣
My jaw dropped once I saw how to consistently clip through structures. Also that underwater technique could potentially open up possibilities for an underwater base!
I'm sad that this will all undoubtedly be patched
Josh definitely put in some hours on this one (even with some creative help)! His patience and determination to do everything "as the dev's intended" is truly incredible.
Oh God, this is giving me flashbacks to climbing radio towers in far cry 3 and constantly falling off.
A yes Tornados been a while 🤣
Seems legit
thank you been waiting for this one for decades
How isn't this game lagged to death with this endless floating footpath nightmare =D
2h. Early!
I now understand why it took a month to get a new LGIO
My favorite chanle
Satisfactory: raft
This raft josh made is now basically his own version of snakes and ladders but extremely cursed Anyways keep up the great content
Yet another cinematic masterpiece
WOOHOO
Now that you know you "technically" have infinite oxygen, what is your depth limit?
Hewo
Devs need their games to be "Josh proof" now because Josh is an absolute menace for game developers LMAO.
This man is developers nightmare.
Bruh bless your soul the sheer amount of time to break these games is insane I freaking love the chaos thank you for all the fun and thrilling rides
I haven't even started the video and I already see chaos unfolding in the thumbnail. I have so many questions.
All the developers in emergency meeting rn looooll
"Now that it looks like a screensaver from 20 years ago..." Well... age was something I didn't need a reminder of
Breaking Any game is a cup of tea for josh
Josh will do anything he whants and no one can or will stop him
This channel should be called "how to get bald as game developer watching this channel"
🤣🤣🤣
An absolute madlad
Josh might take his time uploading but it’s 100% worth the wait. He puts so much effort into creating these monstrosities
Resisting the urge to write a joke SCP based on josh ......  SCP-LGIO-J Object Class: Keter Object Description: SCP-LGIO-J is a reality- bending being composed of an unidentified light blue and orange gas. When asked about its origins, SCP-LGIO-J replied 'Hey there it's Josh, welcome back to let's game it out. Today we're going to be destroying humanity, starting with this little guy!' Further interviews are prohibited by order of site admin [REDACTED]. SCP-LGIO-J is extremely intelligent and displays a notable lack of empathy. When given children's toys (two human figurines, measuring 3.5" and 3"), it began to act out an apocalyptic scenario with them, eventually [REDACTED] both figures. Special Containment Procedures: SCP-LGIO-J is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-[REDACTED]. Any vents, windows, etc. are to be removed or sealed. To satiate its thirst for chaos and keep it from attacking researchers assigned to it, various video games and the means to play them are to be provided. The games must have some method of building or creating and/or some method of destruction. A list of games it has been allowed to play are available in Dr. [REDACTED]'s office upon request.  Yes ik this isn't good it's only the second SCP I've written so shush
5:35 Josh ignores the character giving his pronoun.
Looks like a wither storm
Please make videos faster
And when the world needed him most, he returned.
İ agree
Wow so I already knew what I was getting myself into as soon as I saw that unbelievable thumbnail..
Eaven at the start
😂walking the plank haz got a whole other meaning here! 😂
Ah sweet. Man made horrors beyond my comprehension.
shadow of war ?
He alwase make me laf
12:07 LMAO YOU WHAT??!
Josh allways finds a way around anything
Getting scarily uncanny with the earlier videos..
By the way you talk i can't figure out if you really tried 5960 times to find the code or did the puzzle.
Announcer: Welcome to joshes life hacks Josh:if you want to go somewhere use detail planks
Wait, it's been 20 YEARS since the pipe screensaver!?! Honestly, that was the most shocking thing in this video...
You are my fav YouTuber
Yep
The endurance of this man is a danger to society... we have to thank the game developers for every minute they gift us without Josh as the supreme leader of the world XD
HI
rusak 😂
this is the soda with you need to be the car also yes raft is and rocks is good
hahahahaah WTF is this so funny
I've seen this "tornado" in other game. Maybe Satisfactory? ))
Finally, another raft video. Let's GOOOOOO!
Nooooooo he missed the snow mobile:(
Josh just a few years ago was a normal Let's Player but he suddenly snapped at some point and went crazy
That was an insane bug test. Please don't tell me the devs released the final build when this is still possible lol
You should upload nore often, i cant wait for your next videos😅🤣
note to self:  if you ever complete that game give it to Let's Game It Out so he can destroy it.
screw therapy, this will do
One of your best videos.
HOW MUCH WOOD DO YOU HAVE.
Josh : HOLD PLEASE!!! His PC : Ah S*it , here we go again
6:25 is unironically really pretty to me ^.^
Man could speedrun game on accident with the stuff he does
My sides hurt so baaad
i have been waiting for this :)
Oh wow, couldn't find anything to sell out for this month I guess huh
Josh play risk of rain 2
ITS BEEN LIKE A MONTH AAAAAAAA
This is the longest let’s game it out video 32 minutes new record
Josh has a wanted poster in Hydroneer for completely breaking the economy
It’s my birthday AND josh uploaded a video
If this game has multiplayer, that unwalkeable rug calls for a trap
How the hell
Tag your Nope 2022 spoilers Josh.
A half hour?!
Next level beating the system
Okay, Josh we all know the "the shark" is Grace. No need to not call her out as such and torment her relentlessly 😛
Ur videos always make my day better.
No way that tornado is made of zip lines
please more astroneer
Thumbnail: *Shows tornado Me: Oh no, not again
built a parkour course in raft...
The Satisfactory Conveyor Tornado is back! Just less nuclear!
The way Josh is just casually standing on a raft with a Cone shaped Kraken, im now thinking of a giant raft where earth is now no water
You can go underwater no issue - i wonder if there's a limit to how low you can go - the ultimate game of limbo
AHHHHH I love breaking the laws of physics!!!! "the standard phase through the door"
they should just have josh play test games, then there wont be anymore bugs
25:30 At this moment, you could just use first person and take the key, i played raft and it actually works
Love your videos. This is great
He put a raft platform on a detail plank. And that got me thinking.... combine that and the underwater trick... make a underwater section for the raft. That would be absolutly insane.
Epic ending
Ah once again we may experience the sweet serenade of his voice
Lol
Amogus
if he took this much glitching but in real life, he would be a millionaire by selling dirt
Best game content creator. I wish I had you as a friend in person
he can't do anything without tornadoes can he?
no matter how bad my day has been it becomes a good day when josh posts a video
21:37 it looks like a bioshock1 intro
YAY hooray for josh im glad hes back
This is insane
my god, its beautiful
Did he actually sit there and bruteforce it or did he look it up and then made us think that he did
How much time do you spent on your video’s?
You just cheated your whole way Out of the game
Very good
ive played a few hours of raft and to see what all was done in this video just blows my mind. mad respect.
game dev: sees gameplay of their game by LGIO the game dev: *SWEATING AGGRESIVELY*
We should name him Josh the Nightmare of Games, Breaker of Physics, and Demon of the Games.
I would pay to see developer’s reaction to this video
I swear I heard the game screaming every time he squeezed through doors
3D pipe screen saver 🤣
I would say I hate it takes so long for you to upload but I think it makes your videos even funnier
23:23 😳 oh?
I’m early (kinda)
Bro taught me the real way to play video games
can believe you did a perfect "Dynamite Clone" Ending run! Very impressive
Is kinda amazing how the game didn't crashed after Josh skipped so many stuff lmao
W josh
Once again, watching Josh break one of my favourite survival games hurts me in the best possible way.
juliet uniform lima india echo tango  oscar sierra charlie alpha romeo  echo charlie hotel oscar   mike india kilo echo  alpha lima papa hotel alpha  mike india kilo echo  alpha lima papa hotel alpha
Month by month I am more and more certain that Josh actually found a way to either time travel or freeze time, since that is the only plausible explanation to how he has the physical time in a day to just try 5960 combinations on the lock, besides the other things he does.
Lol and super impresif
Hi
Oh my that "like a screen saver screen from 20 years ago" joke holds a lot of fun memories
Josh is the kind of gamer.  That Makes Death Question himself if he's living his life, being law abiding citzen and if he paid he's insurance well.
I love this lol
Funniest YouTuber I ever seen
Oh Josh, your beautiful commentary highlights my day XD
WOW
HOW MANY HOURS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
12:04 Its the good satisfactory times all over again :D
This was beautiful.
lmaooo
I like to think the devs enjoy this even more then I do.
I like how Josh can completely destroy game server's and destroy planets and bring small game industries to their knees with his chaos creations but when an npc says " a friendly face" that's too far for him 🤣🤣
ah yes breaking Raft. You always break the games you play, or you at least make a mess
This was frustrating to watch, and I've never even played the game.
At this Point. This guy Is Normal compared to twitter
antanahs
Music to my ears when at the start of a episode I hear hey there it’s me
Why u do this
When josh says anything like is there a limit or do you want to know what I have been doing prepare for something that the human eye was never meant to see something that would give you a stroke
Love you man 💗💗
After the years I'm still jumping around trying to escape the first room in Zelda, so I'm a Mario kart type. This video was so entertaining, that tornado magic.
Was that 9hrs literal? Dedication!
Imagine if real life is a game and josh is playing it
Game development I'm i a joke to you josh inset meme
plz try minecraft
I knew josh was gonna do something insane with the detail plank.
Very sad he stopped calling Grace, Grace
30:39 Local man scares final boss off with variable wooden planks.
oh boy its time for some weed
josh literally just finish the game with board bug lol
23:22 😩
All of these raft videos are just a complation of all the things the devs need to fix
It certainly is entertaining to watch Josh play games in completely unintended ways.
The devs are probably gonna put a bounty on this man he broke the game so much
Josh, I am begging you to play Subnautica.
Half expecting to see him die of radiation poisoning. When I saw the tornado... and then he finds radiation anyway.
it seems like the game got 99x glitchier since the last video
Josh, what did you do this time?
This was such a genius gameplay! Josh never disappoints!!
How much time do you have
Satisfactory callbacks
29:09 my brother in Christ, YOU are the most wizard person in the world of this videogame
dude just created a speedrun strat
Omg
what mods did you use to give you endless items?
Nice
U r awesome man.. 🤣🤣
LETSGAMEITOUT your a man of many talents.
Bro I like how we just play normally and he comes here to try to glitch everything
Every time Josh seems excited about something, you know chaos is just around the corner
How does josh always manage to break the game like how I mean I’m not complaining it’s funny also game developers should just hire him to test out their game so he can find all the problems with it
Great Video! *You know your in for some fun when josh plays raft*
Josh uploaded! It’s a great day
Upload this to a Speedrun site lmao, btw rlly funny video man keep up the good work and the chaos! 😂
Joshnado terrorises another game design😏
I've never been here in the first 20 minutes of the video being out, it feels like an honor
Build a ship like the ⚫️ pearl 🚢
There are trains in astroneer now maybe you should stop by astroneer
Been waiting for this 🥵
Yay more Raft more over the top builds - drowning 101 Lessons and hilarious Shark Attack mis haps.  You could try building a Nuclear Generator here teach nature some real manners lol.  Respect and keep up the epic work.
YES YOU MADE A PART 3
Epic
Josh could be the worlds best bug and glitch finder in any game
Ah yes the all new no doors exist speedrun! Been waiting for this
U know when he says 9 hours he means it😆😆
If Let's Game It Out and The Spiffing Britt played together the world would implode.
i was just watching ur last vid last night.
Ah yes, the crafting table just in front of the toilet—my ideal home office. Thanks, Josh!
the best utopia ever.
200K in 2 hours for a reason
Oh no I am getting visions of hygroneere
Hey are you ever gonna get back to that caveman game
Developer: watches this Also Developer: dies inside
Saw there was a new video and literally squealed
Me when I see a new let’s game it out video: “here comes the chaos”
Nice seeing you back Josh
Celine Dion lab:)
Best videos like always😁👍🏼😂
The tornado boat reminds me of the tornado structure you did in Satisfactory haha. Love a good man made tornado! Love the vids
If there's one thing josh hates the most it has to be physics
I was waiting for another raft video... and it has finally come! Huzzah!!
Dev: We made a new amazing expansion adding tons of new elements ! players will love exploring every nook and cranny of  Josh: *B O R D*
finally a new video is out
"Door is locked from the other side. Well im sorry you feel that way door" 🤣🤣😂🤣
Was Tasty McOrgans the guy chilling in his jorts at the relay station?
I think that if he had went the normal way it would have been faster cuz he had to make so many planks and that's a lot of time spent resource gathering and that's what I love about josh like the pain which he gose just to avoid playing the “intended way” is worth a salute 👏👏
You should play spore
Delightful. ❤️
I've been jonesing for some josh, weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Epic just epic
Developer - "What could we add to the game that's totally not going to break it? A detail board!" Josh - "Hold my detail boards."
oh n o
I would love to see you play either Kerbal Space Program or My summer car. That would be amazing
favourite qoute: "just give me a few minutes."  9 hours later....
I’m getting conveyer-nado flashbacks
I'm gonna save this one for the weekend.
Been waiting for this for over a year lol
My man out here making far cry 4 bell towers on a raft
Whenever Josh boots a game up I wonder if the devs have nightmares of "Omae wa mou shindeiru"
josh is just inventing new speedrunning strategies at this point
Finalu a new video
time to create total nightares in raft!
Boarding Action
definetly how detail planks are supposed to work
I love your game play throughs. It makes the game so simple. I tried watching other youtubers play it the normal way, how weird.
Great....been waiting for another raft gameplay
as soon as he said "varuna point" I was eager to see his reaction to realizing most of its under the water, and see him detail plank his way through the water.
I oddly start missing his voice after a while 😂
Where is 1fps gameplay and crashes?
the videogame eviscerate is back
1 hour gang
Josh controls first person characters like a demon possessing a human body
I was literally just going on a Josh watching spree-
MORE LONG DRIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pls:(
Hell yea more raft!
Can you do more satisfactory
Greatest Content Ever
nice.
TIL this game actually has plot.
I believe the "let's game it out" and "how to basic" would be best friends
Devs after seeing what you’ve done with planks: “Hold up”
Thanks for giving me enough time to beat the game before you broke it.
Hi
We don't want to run out of space!
Hi
At least he didn't find the craftable ziplines this time.
Josh, why are you like this?
Incredible how that ending lined up for the perfect LGIO experience!
You and grey in games are the perfect lag and chaos duo
I bet that game dev's let him have access to the game to see how many exploits this man can find, then patch them after the video drops....
The inhabitants of Utopia sing praise of one deity: Boardman. Reality contortionist, defier of physics, impervious to broken legs. No matter how high up you are or how many locked doors you hide behind, you are not safe from Boardman. Wherever he goes, he leaves a path of twisted boards in his wake, a reminder of his unnatural capabilities. You cannot run from him. You cannot hide from him. He will split your consciousness into two, making you exist in two points, forced to repeat the same actions over and over for eternity. He is the master of your fate. He is Boardman.
Does josh voice over his videos?
You wanna know what I think would make a great series, or dare I say, a television show?  A contest between indie devs to see who can make the most Josh-Proof early-access game.  I’d literally pay to see that, because we all know any developer would have better chances at a Steam Award than making a secure product.
cool story bro
Hey 👋 just wanted a quick note 📝 said that she will have the address on her account for next year so we could get a hold for him tomorrow if he has to be there in about a half a year if she is interested to get the money 💵 or whatever it takes and she can pay 💰 to help us pay 💰 bill 💸 but I will ask if we could help with that stuff or do you want me to send her to to the bank 🏦 I don’t think 🧐 is doing anything wrong 😑 I think 💭 will have it in a lot but it doesn’t look 👀 and it’s nice 😊 and we will have it in our office office next next month if if it it will be better better if if if it happens then I I don’t know know where we we need need it it it just just me me me up up 🆙 with you you need need help help and and your family family love 💗 so we we we will will will see see see see see see see see see see see see what it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it out out

@27:11 "2nd ⭐ on the right" is the directions to NeverLand lol
The Celine Dion Research Facility 😂😂
I guess the developer will add a build limit around the yacht Edit : and that detailed plank
best way to speed run a game
At the beginning of the video, I was like "this is where the fun begins"
Nice vid ddd
jjjjjeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezzzzzzzzzzzzzzussssssssssssss
Nice vid dd
Hi
Did satisfactory teach you nothing about tornadoes? Well at least this one worked
Nice vid d
Nice vid f

I really wanna see this man play five nights at Freddys security breach!
This guy started playing fortnite in raft
Hi
🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Nice vid nice and
I love the way he finds codes...brute forcing it
This is like greystillplays but a terrible knockoff
6:01 new back rooms level
can a game developers hire him to test and try to break their game? at this point im convince that he's a pro at testing games and checking for bugs ,i mean breaking the game by using bugs
With the amount of games Josh crashes, he needs to partner with the developers and have them record their reactions to watching Josh destroy their seemingly indestructible game in every possible way.
I love this channel
ooo new raft video
Cant wait him discover nuke in satisfactory
josh% speedrun world record
This took four years of development… Just a quick reminder it came out in 2018 and then released pieces of it until now….
he’s back
That moment when Josh started with his stack hell and the shark just chomped on that tile makes me cracking. He knows what’s coming and doing his part to keep the game running longer XD
One of the best vids I’ve seen from you love you dude!
Imagine trying to survive on a raft in a middle of the ocean then you see a wooden tornado slowly coming towards you
Hi Josh
Dang videos are never this long
Cant wait to see how good and funny this one is
Nice nice
Its a good day when Josh drops a vid of himself breaking games 😂
Nice i
First hour
Yay
I just realised why these videos take so long. This man goes on an existential exodus across time and space before deciding what universe to implode before moving onto the next.
Smi7y and the others needs multiple vids to finnish raft completly  Josh:*finnished raft in multiple vids*
The fact is i look the entire story of raft with 1000 glitch and no interest for the real story wile ppl make 20 vid to get to the end while he do it in 1
i watch this video on my wii u
I love your sarcastic devilish gameplays
i've never been this early, i feel proud of my self
Excuse you that sharks name is Grace?!
one of these days i want to see josh running for his life from a stampede of game developers chasing after this certified lunatic XD
Lets Game It Out always makes torture devices for the npcs inside or make something that can crash or make your frames look like they were done in a google slideshow
The developer probably getting anxiety after watching this
？？？？ omg
change your mic it hurts my ears :(
Nice
Hey 👋

Meow
Josh being like Team Seas and clearing trash from the ocean
Wake up babe Josh remembered his YouTube password

I love how much effort he puts in his videos. This took probably 20 hours to make, thats soo crazy!
Lol he spends hours working on useless thing I guess that’s how you pass time 😂
Lets game it out made a 10 hour plus game (probably) feel like 30 minutes. You're good, I'll give you that
You know it's gonna be a good day for u and a bad day for the game devs and josh's computer when he uploads
Yes
Brah this madman’s work never gets old

Just perfect
For  everyone thats new to the channel they might think you looked the last Code up. But no you spent literal HOURS infront of that save just entering one after another number. What the hell do you do while inputing thousands of numbers?
That was spectacular!
Man really turned a peaceful raft game into fortnite real quick
yesses another raft video at last! These are always hilarious.
Nice vid
1:35 heyyy, do you wanna take that back?
Are there really people in this world who don't know Rat yet?
Nice vid
Mmmmmmmh Espresso
Forget Iceman and Frozone... I choose Plankman! Good fun as always, thanks
I have an idea: raft but if I leave the raft the video ends
"Josh's floating castle"
Always a good day when a new video posts!  Thanks for the laughs!

This was a really interesting episode of the lockpicking lawyer

Josh has found out how to speed run Raft
3:02 for later...
The return of the tornado structure.
25:14 now I understand why the videos were not released all this month
2:06 “Then we just have to live with our choices” LMAO sounds like my whole life
Seeing this psychotic disregard for anything remotely resembling order or rational thought for janky games is one thing. Seeing it done in games with some actual polish is so much more delightful.
Josh is the embodiment of  "commit to the bit"
As soon as I saw a thumbnail with a giant funnel in it, I knew LGIO posted another gem <3
6:30 its actually pretty nice looking
Nice vid
Nice vid
the crazy part is i was hoping two days ago that you played raft againm, especially with all the updates, and we get this blessing today!!
nice to see grace again
Return to SIM airport and trap the planes.😃
What you should have done with the raft and the "giant golf ball" is sit on the outhouse and let it no-clip you inside.
this video violates the Geneva convention btw :3
He's back with raft!!
I think someone sent me a fake message that basically said that I was chosen in a contest and the person was named TEXT ME ➡️ GRAY PLAYS 🎁 was that you or not??? Gray help me please
I like how the raft started as four planks to a tree, then to a hornets nest.
Nice vid
omg I missed grace the shark 🥺
Yup. Here comes a patch to that those planks out!
Nice vid yo
Nice vid
One piece boats be like:
Nice vid
When ever I hear "hey there its Josh welcome back to let's game it out" I just get a sudden rush of adrenaline!
Nice vid
Nice vid
Josh is the only person who can say “9 hours later” and people will believe it because when the screen comes on the game is so broken that it is unrecognisable.
Just when I sam the thunbnail i knew these are planks they felgi so strange for the building system and I knew he is gonna love them
Bruh really crush the game 😭
Josh's mode of movement in this game: 🏗👍👈💨👈💨👈💨👈💨👈💨👈💨🌪
Nice vid
Pls more!
Keep it up comrade =_=
Nice vid
This is the best raft content on YouTube.
bro you have a lot of pations
The best vid
That is a one POWERFUL BUG.    Detail planks  will be remembered                           after an update.
I love the videos they're so good I love you so much I love your voice
"The top twelve most terrifying words in the English language are: "Hey there, it's Josh. And welcome back to 'Let's Game it Out.'"   -Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States
Spectacular vid
Let’s game it out: we don’t need keys where we are going
Amazing vid
Every time when josh plays a normal game : *welp time to lag glitch destroy everything*
This man just unintentionally speed ran raft
Nice vid
why's this shark so aggressive and singleminded about eating the human? real sharks don't do that
I wonder what it is like for the developers to watch this freakshow. Love your content Josh!
25:15 Sometimes the resilience of this psychopath horrifies me
he's just so good at finding exploits im surprised that he hasnt shown us an irl infinite money glitch yet
Always excited to see how you are able to break any game
i like when josh breakes the game with those plankes
Play astronear there is a new update that adds trains
mmm mmm mmm seeing the thumbnail of a new LetsGameItOut vid is such a joy. uwu
i feel the ocean cleaner 9000 or the long trash collecter could get all the pollution in the world
i wonder what the devs of raft would think when they see this
Play teardown
The world gets just that brighter whenever Josh uploads a new vid ❤️❤️❤️
Yay my wish in a comment from on of the recent-ish videos have come true.
Real Gamer LOL
what is it with josh building tornadoes in swedish games
The true god bridge
you should do is there a limit on how deep you can go with the boards
ok challenge run: beat the game witout leaving the raft
I missed the tornado <3
Yes more raft
josh you never fail to make me realize ANY game can be a horror game
The ending was unexpected 🤣🤣
how much sanity does he have left
hAHAHAA
He is like the lockpickinglawyer but with pixels
Please return outro music! I miss it so much - gives me very nostalgic vibes
Oh yeah
Your videos are so good
Not only is Josh advertising games, he's also literally bug testing them
Oh i'm so glad to watch your videos Josh
We are all having fun here xD
Everybody: Talking about his return                  The Shark: *confused screaming*
Watching the same portion of the same game played by the same person multiple times.  Never gets old with Josh.
Idea: beat this game without touching the ground(of land places
Aa good raft
Glitching RAFT be like
“Raft but I don’t touch water”
wow...you want a cookie or a trophy for that? C'mon be more original :) but glad to see you back!
24:26
The fact that I went through the hell of completing this entire story, and seeing him just walk in with a decorative plank of wood... Infuriating.
I missed this so much <3
24:31
Josh: "Is there a limit?", "Only one way to find out", "Hold, please", "Check this out", "I have an idea," or "Can I really just do [game-breaking action]?"  Devs of the game watching the video, profusely sweating with a pen and paper in hand: "Record every damn thing that happens next. We'll need this for our next update patch."
Yo skedadudler
“just short”
Josh: plays Raft again  Raft developers: he can't break the game if we don't show him an item that can bypass everything  Design Plank: are you sure about that?
Josh became god and is terrorizing the raft universe
He’s too smart anything he touches it can fall apart causes computers to weep silently
I have been waiting for this for an entire month and I’m happy I’m seeing this super cool video :D
YYYYEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAA
"Give me a few minutes." *9 hours later
I would never have though of doing any of this with the detail planks, lol.
tornado raft.  Satisfactory Flashbacks.
Whenever you see a nightmarish tornado made of planks that has like 50 tendrils in the distance, you know your dead.
I’m so sad he forgot grace’s name😔
Devs: He, but... but, he... ...snuck up & hit us like a tornado!
Who else is waiting for him to wreak havoc on this game 🤩
Is there a stat that shows how many planks you laid down because that number would be really hilarious I bet
I hope the dev dont patch this out
The day is finally come he is posted again
Welcome back
Everytume Josh uploads, it's like a major event.
if you ignore the amount of time it probably took josh to gather material for all those planks, this is a really impressive speedrun of the whole game
Alternative title : raft speed run tutorial
Hi
ah yes. Manmade horror beyond my comprehension. aka this base.
damn
Yaayy
you could say he has the wold record
About time! Lets gooooooo!!!!!
So this is why developers hate giving players customization
How long until the wanted posters pop up in this game?
Raft always seemed like a fun game. I may have to pick it up soon, despite me not being familiar with this type of genre (Minecraft like?) and (from what I've read) the last update has some issues.
Satisfactory meets Raft... So, did you request a nuclear power generator yet?
I enjoyed this, this was madness and I love that :>
Yours is the only channel that I actually turned on notifications. See you again in a month or so. Cheers!
After a while of waiting it's come hit the can can .music
Mans is creating Speedrun techniques
Oh my god that safe combination ....  alright let's do this
I was born in 2011
Haha &Finally man, btw there is an awesome carbon copy of this game pretty much on android!
Oh and with @Carson Flang
new videoooo, lesgoooo!
In between this, Satisfactory, and Hydroneer, I'm beginning to suspect you really like tornadoes
Yes
Every day Josh releases a new video is a good day
Cheese
30:55 "Master key"  Looooool!
A NEW LGIO VIDEO AN IM EARLY
Eu estáva esperando esse momento
Just imagine your in your own raft and see a massive tornado with a plank that extends into a “golf ball” as somebody inside says ‘oh there it is!’
So this is what you were doing
Olololololololololplololololol
Watching his vids give me a new view in things
I was just wondering if there was a new video, I open up YouTube and there it is. The first video in my recommendations.
I wanna see my guy play Minecraft just to see how much can he break it
Finaly a video
I love how Josh broke the games
I love your way of playing games
I want to know how many hundreds of thousands of board feet was used.
This are god doard
quack
finally, i’m early
you're a menace to all game developers
Josh love it when you post a new video I'm 8
i have a rug can i place it outside i sure can can walk on it i sure cant
He paid tribute to the conveyernado
This raft-nado reminds me on the conveyo_ belt-nado from satisfactory
I just realized , brute forcing 4 digits is possible if you have time
@Let’s Game It Out you should totally check out the new train update in Astroneer
Love what you do and it always help when I’m not feeling good, you make me laugh and I hope for you never to quit YT :)
Josh in raft is trully the devs worsy nightmare  He uses things the game was not intended to do and made modern art a tornado  And cheezed the game with meerly boards thatd entire epurpsose was decoration  The devs will nerf it and make it no clip to players to abodi this hysterical disaster
Another masterpiece! Well, bye bye adjustable board, it was nice knowing ya.
If I had a nickel for every time Josh made a tornado I would have 2 nickels which Isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice right?
Completely AND entirely. Only josh can break a game this bad.
One of the coolest sequences breaks I’ve seen. I think josh got the true ending!
The developers should make a creative mode and call it Josh mode, or put references/easter eggs into it, OR if you spend enough time playing just gathering materials, grinding and stuff, you should get an achievement titled something like, 'are you Josh?' Or some kinda reference to him
"Welcome to lets game it out!" is so like, memorable to me bc i loved to watch your videos and its been awhile ToT
I wish you uploaded more but the Content is always gold. Always perfect.
Play dyson sphere program
Yeahhhh boyyy another Nightmare
It’s satisfactory all over again
Aaah, I love that tune in the intro.
The QA tester god has returned
I think I’m early as to say it was posted one hour ago :/
Does the shark attempt to munch the rug?
6:26 he made something that actually looks good
lol, i feel sorry for game developers with this guy around
Once again, so freaking brilliant.
watching josh sequence break the game is sure a lot more entertaining than normal playthrough
This guy always finds a way to breaker game or find a shortcut to a new area and make huge and crasy things
i laugh just seeing a video thumbnail and be like "okay man what are you broke today ..." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bros going to no clip in to the back rooms
the floating detail board looks like when the aliens from the book 'third body problem' infinitely split a proton(or elctron its a weird book) across a universe and it was visible to the human eye. it was the only for of communication over lightyears of distance.
imagine being the npc and seeing a guy on a 4593532235 foot length plank go trough the door
How to fire an entire QA department.   Step one, give Josh a free game key. Step... well that's it really.
Ur vids are the funniest vids I’ve ever seen
Bro wtf
It's actually quite pretty with the lights.
Oh boy this game
Man, now I have to stop playing Raft for a whole half hour.
Being a lone survivor on a tiny island and this dude slowly drifts in your direction on a wooden tornado
How to beat raft without trying
Every time he says "hmmm" I start to laugh remembering "lunchtime mmmmmmmmmmm"
Grace has been here all along this journey. She has the politeness to not eat the tornado
Never paid much attention to physics I guess, him using depth as PV made me learn what hydrostatic pressure is.
Any chance u could do a Subnautica session? :>
Play more satisfactory it got a new update
The people you saw are people you can play as if you go to the menu
Please make more satisfactory
WHY! Do you do this
The way your mind works is amazing
good
Ive found the masterpiece again 🥲
‘’it’s not like we’re gonna use those things but it’s nice to know they’re there’’ Floridians with turn signals
This is how the navy SEALS breach doors
these raft episodes are just the best!
Love ur content!
A screensaver from 20 years ago. Yes the pipes screensaver! I remember that! Wow I am old.
You know what I said when I saw another Let’s game it out video… I said:  “Let’s… *GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo*”
Just hilarious
Earliest I’ve been I think
been expecting you....
Josh you should teach the LockPickingLawyer how to get trough door quickly
I’m so happy that another raft video came out
the big plank that you built is just making me remember that one dont hug me I am scared episode
Achievement Unlocked! Broke Game, Spared Framerate
Imagine that Utopia-Man's terror when this random guy suddenly shows up and just persistently follows him around on wooden planks like Poseidon riding the waves
Watching this video is making me lose all hope in humanity. But it's really entertaining! So thanks! :D
developer; : i thisk i pached eveything   LGIO : fined game brakeing bug  developer : i quit
The fact that he made this video while i was done arguing with my ex friend makes me feel happy lol
satisfactory flashbacks
You know stuff going down when he makes the building hammer
I didn't even realize this was the newest video
Josh mamaged to make a roblox parkour map out of hist raft lmao
Hurricane Josh
👋👋👋👋😃
22:58 I’d like to think that G stands for Grace
I think that was a way to complete the Game that the devs intended to have
yay another video and yay 1# in trending
Top 10 strangest tornadoes caught in camera
Doctor: you have 32 minutes to live. Me: But this video has 4 seconds more. Doctor: Not My Problem
Josh really said we're gonna take the pacifist route
The raft videos are the best on this channel. Been waiting for more!!! Thanks josh
My bro fortnite bridged his way through most of the game
Hey can you play wobbly life on this channel please
i thought it impossible but he outdid himself with this one
Devs: 👁️👄👁️
Nooo he did not get the mayors hat
nice to see you again josh
I saw that you posted and all I said was: Oh... hell... yessss
He made the tornado from satisfactory lovely. Next he needs to make it into a cacoon.
The thumbnail... looks familiar... VALHEIM!
Desinc viewers also watch this channel.   Me: of course they do
Sucks josh couldnt get the boss statue thing.
We all know that everyone dropped everything the moment they saw that Josh posted a new vid, you can’t tell me otherwise.
0:49 Grace is back!
I did not appreciate the horror at 0:48
this video made me angry
Do you do a video each month? I like your content and I would appreciate *more* content from you, which is a compliment. I'd hit the bell too but why wait for the notification once a month 😝
Haha
25:41 what crossed?
Dab lit duck!
Did you breakup with Grace?  What happened to Grace the shark?
I was waiting for this! You’re videos are so awesome.
idk why but listening to the joy in josh's voice as he creates utter madness all around him really brings me a sense of peace and calm
It's my birthday tomorrow, it would really make me happy if you would say "Hi" or something ;)
Detail Planks basicaly ask for exploits, i'm still surprised with all this chaos xD
play roblox NOW
wow Josh forgot about grace ;-;
I don't know if I must admire you, hate you, or fear you
It's always a good day when he uploads... okay maybe its a terrifying day.
this was so dumb and amazing
God yes. Another Raft with Josh doing some weird and funny crap with Grace the shark.
Great going Josh, you broke the game! 😁
FINALLY A NEW VIDEO
This is gold , made my night hahaha
Game bugs lead to unforementioned, civilization-ending game ending. Boring. Seeing the "conveyor belt tornado" live and rotate -- PRICELESS!
I wonder if josh can push himself through the safe, a different KIND of brute force!
"A bug? No, it's a feature. " ~Josh
The moment I saw the title I immediately thought detail plank. I was right and you did not disappoint.
Josh is Magneto but with wood, Lumberto if you will.
Nice
That string light mess you made was actually rather beautiful Josh can make a six hour game take 10 minutes long
The title scene looks about 8x nicer than any Raft I’ve ever seen in Raft
Im ready for more chaos
Nice
This man has the most schizophrenic voice ever
I realy love your work, and I would love to see what you would do in the game "The last Clockwinder"
Cant wait for a New Episode of satisfactory
If you made raft good job with the detailed board
What's the name of the music in the intro?
NEW VIDEO YAY
the dumb things he makes is the only reason that i love him
Josh uploads another raft video. Expectation: Ooooo I love that game! Can’t wait till he plays the new chapter! Reality: Spawns in infinite boards and proceeds to skip everything in creative mode… I mean it sounds like he cheated, but at the same time he broke the game over his knee till it started crying for help while doing it and definitely spent an extra 8 dozen or so hours playing.  This is a new level of overachieving Josh, please get some help
Josh is what happens when you are a Lucid Dreamer
The devil fears him
Must you make everything into a tornado?
Yeah
I can never even fathom how long these videos take to make
He's a genius
Every new video gets worse then the one before it
I loved the first two episodes. I’ve been waiting so long for this one
so i turned creative mode on
eyy my guy's back!
josh is the reason game devs can't put things like the detail plank in their games without fear.
i was holding out hope for a hydroneer or car mechanic simulator video but raft is perfectly fine with me
24:52 "Door is locked from the other side"  - Well I'm sorry you feel that way.  XD
Josh: "Give me a few minutes" Me: "Okay" 9 Hours Later Me: *sweating* 11:58
Ohno
You can also have 2 engines facing opposite directions to make the planknado spin
Ah raft a classic
And to think the developers just wanted us to have a nice looking boat, but gave us hacks
You litterly cant complain about joshs upload schedule because he spends weeks playing games for our entertainment. Love ya josh
are you on speed?
U left the jet ski
Ayyyyy another upload
FINNALY
Hey josh you should do another satisfactory video for update 6 ^-^
It’s not a Let’s Game It Out video without creating a CPU destroying cyclone
My man …. You just broke the game I just finished a week ago and took me a while …. I love you
You should post more
The definition of this video is just “ why walk when you can fly”
no ...
His raft is literal art
15:23 WYSI SHEESH
Adding more people to this game kinda defeats the whole vibe... Why did they think it's a good idea.
Bro I just got raft for myself What timing
I wonder how much of this content is actually on the console versions. I won't buy this on ps4 or Xbox unless it has the trading system.
josh:you know where this is going...give me a few minutes... everyone watching this:oh god...
I hate how I instantly understood the screensaver reference...
I f***ing love you man
this probably broke speedrunning (minus the 9 hour tornado)
Hey man if you want a game where you can build huge structures check out Edengrall
FINALLY ANOTHER RAFT VID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yyyyyeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssss Every upload makes my week.
The first thing I thought when I heard this had released “Here comes another LGiO”!
If its the end there I think you should still play it so you could screw up more
My cup runeth over with let's game it out
This is the only way to have fun or do anything interesting in this game.
this is something worthy of my useless time
Every year I look forward to the annual iPhone refresh. Every month I look forward to the monthly Josh upload 😂
he protecc he attacc but most importantly he builds plancc
THANK GOD FINALLY MY FAVOURITE GAME HE DOES
Why every time you play this game you jump off and then you say your fine even though you you make him jump off a cliff.😅😐
1.6k th comment
That was amazing!
I just realized - I haven't seen 'Grace' in any of your recent videos, I remember even the shark in Raft used to be called Grace. She's no longer evil incarnate? Have you made peace with Grace?
and this coud be incredibel for speedruning
I have been waiting so long for a new video. And you nailed it again. Hilarious! And your great ideas!
Oh god, it’s satisfactory all over again it’s glorious
Josh's titles sound like clickbait, look like clickbait and yet that's actually what happens in his videos - complete and utter carnage! Keep the chaos coming!
Yo it’s been a while josh love to see a new video keep it up
this is both the fastest raft speedrun ive ever seen and the most cursed playthrough ive ever seen
AAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I want a dev to create a game that is impossible to be broken
Best moment when your videos release
Yes New let's game it out video
21:17 "Let's go the old fashion way" "Weeee—" *_Crack_* "Wonderful"
One of the best videos! my sides hurt lol😃
Finaly YOUR back,i missed you!
LES GOOOO
He made a red cross out of rugs, not because he is playing this game for several hours to record a video slowing decrease his mental health but just that he is worried if his PC will handle all the insane ideas he has.
Because every video has a massive wait in between when a video does come out it makes it so much more satisfying
Love
Our ramp is the ramp that will build straight to heaven!
He is…Board man
good job you completed the mission: HGAAHUWTYEHDDWGYDWUDHW
Every time you post it makes my day better
I say a video from him and I was just like what did he do now
I've been wanting another Raft video for so long. Thank you for making my day
He has the patience of a god
Yessir finally 30 minutes of some gooood entertainement!
Yo you need to play creeper world 4
Yaaaaaaaaaay, oh he still my beating heart, could it be, ohhhh it is, my favorite YouTuber
Nothing like Josh to make a dev realize their grave grave mistakes.
beat game 1 hour ago and saw this, and was pure nightmare and if i watched this i got infinite laugh
would it nt be possible to get to places without the decoration boards by using the rafters?
By just seeing the thumbnail,i really hope you make it to a cacoon like from your satisfactory vid
Let’s game it out just speed runs a game
I thought this game had physics for the building aspects...you can't build too far without supports. How?
that raft it's Josh's Yggdrasil and a branch of the tornado leads to cooking simulator, another to planet crafter, to roller coaster simulator, to hydroneer, to astroneer, to satisfactory and rise of ages definitley
Ah yes my freshly brewed cup of chaos
nice
somebody needs to hire josh as a beta tester for every game in existence
every fan when he posts another video after like a month: A blessing from the lord
I wanted to see Raft, not Fortnite
Aaaaaw yeah, Raft is back
Josh would have been the first Raft speedrunner if it weren't for all the hours he spends building tornadoes and brute-forcing digital locks
Babe wake up, Josh is back!
“Let’s make a captains think tank”-Markiplier 2022
Josh is a literal demon
Oh dear.
Josh it’s been a month now your back why!?
I’m always so excited to see the chaos he creates But also respect to him for spending so much time to entertain us
lmao
Love the vids
I'm impressed by so many things in this video but one of them is how your computer can load all of this planks and not crash. Love your videos man keep it up!
Ironically, in our world Balboa island's waters are surrounded by land.
Raft becomes Subnautica
You should play Minecraft
Your voice is so soothing lol.
In all your video's I have never laughed so hard when you bypassed 80% of the games mechanics using a wooden plank,  when seeing the tornado I instantly thought "no reactors?" but the rads visitation later made me lol again.  That item will no doubt get "fixed / patched". Keep on playing these games the way we want to play but are so soft and play safely.
I was falling asleep. And then this video happened. I've never been more awake than when you upload
WOW I CANT BELIEVE THAT THE MAN MADE A NEW VIDEO ON RAFT
New video yaayyyy
I thought the shark was named Grace.
Josh...what...the...heck...have..you...done...to...the...raft.....
26:22 "Oh God, do I need to care?!" I like that.
comment
How is it that ill watch a new vid of yours, then it obviously goes a few weeks before you post another.. but it's always as I start to re-watch all your videos that a new one gets uploaded 😂   Idk if my timing is impeccable or just a massive coincidence every time 😂
You need to upload more to YouTube.... because I said so
a gift from the lord
Peli takaisin pelitehtaalle
FINALLY
YES HE MADE A NEW RAFT VID
This man is the equivalent of an Eldritch Horror/ God for game devs....
I COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING AT THIS MAN. WELL DONE HAHAHAHAHA
every time i see that you uploaded a new video i know it's going to be something crazy
This was a beautiful adventure
This was a beautiful adventure
bruh i had a dream about an ice region like that when i was listening to one of your videos 😭😭
"why stop there" and "only one way to find out" greatest gaming quotes of all time
“Cmon babe LetsGameItOut posted a new video!”
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻da lights
SPEEDRUN
I totally thought this was a Satisfactory video just judging by the thumbnail and seeing a tornado.
I'm a simple man.  Let's game it out puts a video on YT. I'm happy for 32,05 minutes
Ive been waiting for this one, TURN IT UP!!!!!1!!1!
Play Minecraft

developer after seeing this: this is fine
Windows screen saver! 🤣🤣 had me laughing hard at that one I said it out loud!  Perfectly timed release for the new vid
Lol
One Piece is getting really weird
X,D u r d best
Hello
Hi u should play poppyplaytime
just amazing , thanks man :))
Game developer 1: we need to take this plank out of the game, Josh completely broke it with it. Game developer 2: Do you have any idea how many hours he spent harvesting junk for those planks?
Over 30 minutes of Let’s Game It Out enjoyment. What a day!
His patience and madness can only be admired

Hi
Leave it to josh to find out that you can beat the game with just detail boards 🤣
i like how you play da games :)
Josh next time try to survive on an island for a  whole video
The floor is lava.
Hi
Oh goody a 32minute video??? That's an awful lot of time for man-made horrors beyond my comprehension!
Every day Josh posts a new video is a good day
More planet zoo pls
Were you really that board with the story?
remind me to NEVER get on a life raft with this man
just me thinking that military guy looks like the president of Ukrain?
Josh: The Cheater without cheats.  Short: God of Cheat
Abcde
life is always better when josh uploads
“Aw s—t here we go again”
PLAY GREGTECH
I almost forgot about raft
13:18 Yeah Josh, I don't either walking is the problem I think the touching the grass is the problem isn't it?  You're still walking there only instead of hopping off your extension boards and walking on grass you extend your extension boards and walk on them. ('-')7  Gamer Respect
If I had a nickel for every time Josh built a tornado I’d have 2 nickels, its not a lot but it’s weird it happened twice
Who hurt you gray 🤣🤣🤣
well I got here 59 mins ago perfectly
30min+  video we gonna have so much fun!!
I love this channel for the absolute goofiness and scuffed nature of it.
YAY, NEW HELL! Just as I wanted!
Love your content josh glad your back
Conveyor belt tornado : I am irreplicable    Tornado raft : *are you sure about that?*
Wooww my guyyyy
"let me lay it out for you"... Never have words inspired more anticipation for impending horrors than since you were 16 and caught drinking and smoking by your parents...
The rug really tied the raft together.
lets go new vid!
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Okay, now choose: Plank'o'maniac or Plankomancer?
Perfect thing to watch after getting surgery!😄
I don't know if I should be impressed, in pain, or crying.
The king Returns
Only wood planks hack destroy the whole game🤣
YES ITS BACK
I love that building absurdly tall things is a running theme in LGIO. Too bad Grace had to ruin it immediately.
Josh you never disappoint. Made me stay up late with your tornado raft. Cheers
Babe wake up new lets game it out update
I sure hope he doesn’t do a Minecraft video
You completly destroyed the game xD
"Gimme a few minutes..." :D
Haha, love how you break these games so easily. Bet the devs watching these videos absolutely love you 😂😂
"I don't know what was going on in here, but thank God they have Wi-Fi!"
You got a thing for tornados huh? Conveyer belt tornado that kills frame rates. Raft tornados that wipe out other rafts
That was the best speedrun ive ever seen
This is the first time Josh didnt say grace in this vid
I have missed you so much Josh. 💜
Omg! Now you can smash your legs also while taking a dump!
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

When it comes out in November, you should play goat SIM 3, Josh!
The amount of time I've gone to his video page to see if there was a new upload the last few days is insane. Thank god we get a new video of him completely breaking the game. =D
Get your here within an hour ticket here!
Human made tornado
11:36 also love how you're barely surprised by this 💀
Spliff vs Josh; which one can find the most chaotic exploit? How can we get them to colab on a video?
I will always love watching you brake games beyond comprehension
Whenever Josh says something along the lines of "Let's have a look around" or "Let me give you a tour" I try to brace for either a huge nightmare or something that is really cool.
I love ur vids
Sans Snas
No good stuff alod
Shark pov : my name is GRACE!
Josh knows magical ways of messing with a game so much they just accept defeat
Hey josh! All my friends and I love your vids and please give me a tutorial on breaking raft at some point
I love your vids pls give  me a shout me out
Sans
Hey what’s up I watch is 56 minutes before it was
Got so excited when I saw this… HELL YEA
you always have to build a tornado don’t you.
10th day of asking LGIO to continue the adventures of Johnny Hotbody.
wow this is insane keep it up josh you are amazing keep being awesome and lets hope the next upload is just as good I LOVE THE INSANITY
Hi you da best
reminded me of an end city for a minute there
With just wood boards he essentially became a US SEAL
so much effort into 1 video... geez
Sub to let's game it out
This man is the absolute bane of game developers, he breaks the game beyond recognition just for the fun of it. Only for him to figure out other ways to do this crazy stuff after it gets patched
Josh the best 🤣
by the gods i love hearing "hey guys welcome back to lets game it out"
The sheer effort and time gone into this is really worth subscribing alone!
love your streams.   love your video.  love you.
He should do a video where he plays the game normally and we just wait for chias and he confuses us
I’ve been looking forward to your conclusion of raft, I think it’s my second favorite series next to the hydroneer one. An incredible game breaking finale lmao.
Josh saying "give me a couple minutes" and "several hours later" is such an iconic duo.
Hey Josh, you should play bitlife! 🧬🧬🧬🧬🧬🧬🧬
I love you so much, I was waiting for a new video. <3
Hi
fooking dope
yay raft again
*P L A N K E R M A N*
Finally, 30 minutes of entertainment
Veri big brain moves
Why is the original stringlight/beam mess kinda pretty?
It is  midnight here BUT it's worth it
Oh god, Josh just may have revolutionized raft speed running. Phasing through reality as we know it!
YAS! The chaos bringer has made another raft vid! You should play the isle evrima and became a hypsi and SPIT IN EVERYONES EYYYYES! Edit:Or become a pachy and break everyone's bones. either way just cause chaos hehe
Thx for making another raft video I love and hate how you play this so wrong Edit:i love your videos and i am happy im on time to watch a new one
I think you ar the Guy With the most pasians
*excitedly awaiting the devs comment on this video*
3 minutes  and  a thousand comments   geez.
love that bruteforce 🤣
I had a feeling that he’s gonna build a cocoon like in Satisfactory
I don’t know if this is slower or faster then doing it the right way
Finally🥲🥲🥲
*JOSH*  ABILITIES: can act hurt, when really not, uses everything he has for anything he can do WEAKNESSES: common sense, non chaotic scenarios
Well every time Josh updated a new video i knew it's gonna be a disaster and weirdly enough useful cheat way how to get into the places faster..
Wtf
Well, that was some kind of fever dream
That has got to be the greatest creation of mankind. The mighty Raft-ornado 🤣
Hello
I'm glad to see the second appearance of Josh-nado, first seen in Satisfactory. I wonder where the the tornado's lore is going to bring us next
It would be awesome if you could bring Anthony back for a video
Not even being in the middle of nowhere can stop josh from doing josh things
I like how you took the time to add parkour into a survival game
People always believed greatest horrors beyond comprehension is, inhumane, while true in nature, One has proven us all mistaken. Every second the world fears from his return, and when it is time, the world will re-watch what chaos he molds. His name    was Josh
10:38 I love the running gags of you pronouncing Vasagatan "vegetarian" 🤣
He manage the speedrun the game wtf
I love watching Let's Game It Out play the game as intended.
TBH that raft doesn't look to bad at 6:41
Every 2 minutes I was just yelling "NO! STOP!" because of Josh's reality breaking capabilities. Great video!
whenever you see Josh find an exploit, prepare for a nighmare in every way, shape and form
trash collection raft
when Josh starts taking the board express,  "Raft is typing..."
Although it may seems like let's game it out cheated through the whole game, i feel like it's also genius. He did not spoil the games remaining plot lol
Gods dead
Not enough ads, would watch again
You know it’s a good day when Josh posts
Your video showed up just as I was about to leave for work -- now I'm late. Totally worth it!
oh boy, I wonder what eldritch abomination Josh is gonna make today
Its a holiday josh uploads
E
He’s gonna make the devs release another chapter so they can fix the exploits Josh found.
Yay another LGIO upload! Thanks for making my day better. <3
you just know if josh says that one thing. It’s bout to go down
I absolutely love his laugh
Ha he lu ya. Ha ha lu ya. Hahaluya hahaluya HAHELUYA
YEEEEEET!!!
after what i say as ETERNITY you made a video
Hello
The frame rate be like: 🐌
You know its a good day when Josh makes a tornado!
1352nd L BOZO NO LIFE LOSERS I GOT 1352ND PLACE BET YO JEALOUS
Literally the best gaming channel on yt… going thru some stuff and this just takes my mind off things… josh never fails to make me laugh😂
Hes literally the Thanos of video games
Finallllyyy
Within an hour
Game developers fear this man.
You should play undertale
damn I'm late
Hello josh
That was wonderful. 7👍/7👍
You learned *rug.*
Blessed with a 32 mins video 🙏amen
Damn when I saw the video in recommendations I made a silent hapiness and fright scream.
I got so excited when I saw that you uploaded. <3
“Now this is a boss battle I can get behind!” Literally.
Another video for developer of game to cry about 😂😂
Yes!
It worth the wait who agrees  👇  👇  👇
I swear every time I watch your videos my eyes get tortured by your horrific creations
Beautiful
Ahh josh just uploaded, I wonder what eldritch terrors I shall witness today!
Do a cooking sim vid again. They added bread for sandwiches
Best of Josh Sentences "Only one way to find out" "Oh, that was easy (yet he broke the game) "mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
No game is safe from this maniac 💀
It triggers me when he never picks up items like crates or briefcases at story locations, breaking gamer instincts
Josh is the type of person to leave a game open for a whole year for a 5 minute bit
Fake
haa
building visigoth collection raft
Imagine saving a bunch of people and than they see the raft you built to reach them
Omg, finally, been waititng for a continuation for the past months :'D I have editing to do, but once I saw that a new Raft episode is out I decided to procrastinate :^) Let's goooooooooooooooooooooo
Apparently physics doesn’t exist in this game
Hmmm... am I missing something here? Why Josh call the shark as "Shark", not "Grace"?
Hurray you're back, oh how I have missed you.
fing love this channel
raft!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yay.
i've been waiting for another raft video ! my body is ready
I'm not sure Grace likes Josh very much
I love the fact not only josh manage to find a game breaking glitch, he also carve a path to a possible fastest speedrun too
Honestly I'm surprised that he decided to destroy this instead of just leaving it. 10:45  Edit: oh nevermind he leaves the other ones to hang, just that one gets destroyed.
oh YES Let`s game it out with Raft? is it christmas yet?
how to like a video twice?
Hi
I try so hard to deny reality and pretend that he does any of this legit, and usually it is somewhat possible, but this one is just undeniable.
Ah yes
How 2 youtubers play raft in their own pace: Socks and Blaze: *Proceeds to immerse themselves in the game, while progressing through the game normally for 24 hours straight without the use of exploit, bugs and sleep.*   Josh: *Proceeds to progress through the game in his "own way" while exploit every glitch and bug just to benefit himself, for laughs and giggles, and to scare Olaf by just 1 item in the game.*
Josh!! How the heck are ya?  Still floating around the ocean I see.
a
Hey Josh!!!! I love your videos!!! Especially your Raft content and WorldBox content. Your theme parks are also amazing!!! You’re just such a funny guy and I’m so happy I discovered your channel and you’ve made me laugh countless times.  Thank you for everything you’ve done for me Josh,  FieryPlatypus
YAS
Claim your “Before 1 Hour” Ticket Here!
You need to play Subnautica bro
Raft programmer will regret that letting this man play this game
ffs not again, not another tornado
GRACE FOREVER!
Nice to know your still doing ... raft stuff.
Best Content Ever
Game owners give him keys for a free bug finder.
Can you please play Astroneer. Love your videos
Each time josh uploads dev and QA teams tremble in fear
Most dangerous people in existance 1: satan 2: ur mom 3: Let's game it out
h                                                                                                                            I
R.I.P Grace You will be remembered forever 😢
I like to believe that the devs watched this video, put their face in their hands, and quietly wept.
please try out jurassic world evolution! PLEEEEAAAASE
If the developer don't put his tornado raft in the thumbnail of their steam page my disappointment will be immeasurable and my day will be ruin
Glad to see Josh back
eg 0:01
There needs to be a “DEVS REACT TO LETS GAME IT OUT” where they just watch good ole Josh bastardize their games
That was brilliant! xD Thanks Josh
Speedrunners :"Write that down!"
I've been waiting for this for ever man
wow 🙃
Ye
Hi
Ah, man made horrors beyond my comprehension
I'm gonna be honest im not sure he's human
You make good videos, man!
HES BAAAAAAAAACK !!!!!!!!
josh got 1k comment within 45 min lol
Another spectacular episode of game breaking!
So Minecraft but at sea
Avatar: The Last Wood Bender
Hey Josh! Is Anthony all right?
Josh is the ultimate QA tester.
The return of the king
Josh is just a genius
Josh’s nightmarish creations should be classified as literal scps if they were in real life as they can dust of reality  from the universe like its nothing
man i sure do love him destroying games
I Josh'd my way up to the crane at Varuna Point last week! I kept falling off at one particular part of the obstacle course, so I just made a ramp out of roofing tiles to get past it. Thank you for showing us how to cheese some of these things.
you upload universe: oh no
That is not just a few zip lines that’s 1 million 🤣
How is this man so dedicated I have never seen a youtuber spend so much time on a joke every single vid what a legend.
The speedrun of this game is probably hilarious
4:45 Now this is a masterpiece.
Lets gooooooo
When I found out raft part three came out I knew it was only a matter of time
0000- 0001- 0002- 0003- 0004- 0005.......
wow 36 mins ago :( late
We need a team up of josh and graystillplays
The perfect game tester does exist.
24:32 everyone when twitter users talk to them:
If you ever hear josh say how much fun they had in a game before, be ready to see a much more chaotic version of it
finaly a new video
Claim your within a hour ticket here!
Yes.
Josh I can't say that I'm surprised, but it's so funny how you messed up the game's sequencing and ended up cloning the Olof guy. Now you've created a new reality that was never intended for the game!
Wowzers
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this ? 🥺🥺
Josh's favorite shape: Tornadooooo
finaly another video
Hi
Planking is back!
Josh is making every game developer work 24/7 to fix the bugs that's finding.
Wobbly Life
does anyone else watch Josh build higher and higher and suddenly understand why God punished the tower of babble the way he did?
Yeee
He's really taking his raft to a new height!!! (pun intended)
im more and more under the impression that josh hates himself
Yay a great bedtime story thank you Josh
The fact that he had to do so much material gathering in order to build so many planks, gives me the impression that for this video Josh probably spent 200+ hours :D
play astroneer again
12:04 Satisfactory moment
There will be a time when Josh breaks reality.
nice
The ultimate speed run strategies
wouldn’t it be funny if every time he was playing a game he also wasn’t wearing anything but jorts and a durag
astroneer   have trains
It wouldn't be an LGIO video without a generous amount of chaos.
Oh no, my computer is screaming knowing I am watching this
YES!!!! I loved your Raft videos!
Dude 💀
Utopia burning at the end due to the sequencing glitch is the funniest and most perfect end possible. Amazing work as always sir!
Lmao
noice vid
As soon as you hear "Hey there it is Josh and welcome back to Let's Game It Out" you know something stupid but good and funny is coming.
A
The game devs are crying rn, their perfectly crafted game, with the well crafted story, ripped apart by a single decoration item
The shark is probably like holy crap
You should play satisfactory again because there is new stuff from updates that you can use to break the game!
I love this
LETS GOOOOOOO
That's pretty epic my friend.
These are the best !
PLEASE PLAY SUBNAUTICA NEXT
My Name!
this is great content is always makes me laugh
Is there a limit to how many good videos josh can make? Answer: no
Beautiful. Marvelous, even.
=]
👍
Pre 1 hour club
I think once Josh will play Scrap mechanic and ksp, universe will collapse
I’ve been waiting for a new raft!
Finally, every month you get a golden day, which is the day Josh releases a video.
This man has the amount of patience that nobody else has
you can clip trough walls if you are on a chair when you reach them, amazing vid man
I rly hop raft dev will see this x), ohhh wat would i give to see their faces
Josh, I'm surprised you didn't make a giant raft connecting multiple islands.  I am willing to throw away about a week of my life doing so for you then you could add your commentary voice over and publish it.  I wouldn't ask for any of the profits because I'd already be earning enough with the joy and satisfaction that a video I did is on your channel
Excuse me, her name is Grace.
Josh should do a Speedrun with that
Proving once again that Josh IS the Skeleton Key, the boards were just making it easier.
I want to know Josh, did you have to go back to craft more boards at every place, or was your inventory just literally full of them
There is snow mobile at the snow area
This video is art
Heart please.
RedBeet will start putting a wanted poster in their games for you as well if you keep this up.    Great Job    Cheers
and at this point hes just not even going to do anything the way it was intended lmao
Hi
the ultimate game tester XD
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Collect your "here before 100,000 views" ticket here!
Games fear josh.
This guy ruins games in the greatest ways lol
Ah it’s that time of the month for reality to submit to josh supremacy
your so funny
6:28 actually beutifull
Yay another raft video::
Oh no, Josh is back. Reality braise yourself!
best playthrough of raft ever lol
Josh is proof we don't live in the matrix. He'd have crashed the server by now
wonderful
If satisfactory have beltnado here in raft we have raftnado Thanks josh now we're terrified what's next
I should have known
Noice.
Lmao that ending not so utopia for you josh
Why do developers keep giving you keys if you just destroy there game
*Josh literally destroy the existence of this game by 1 item Redbeet Interactive: "Shouldn't have given it to Josh, shouldn't have given it to Josh"
After this the dev will be scared
The planks did the job
every  video the universe becomes less stable
this is so funny wtf
The devs lets make a item you glithng in every ting
Man, the devs just wanted to add a story😐
Oh damn
Never fails to make me laugh
Game: *Gives players customizable boards to decorate their rafts*  Josh: *Proceeds to create Emrakul the Aeons Torn*
bro game dev should hire you to find bug in their game
I aspire to be as chaotic as Josh
The amount of entertainment Josh videos provide is not comparable.   Keep it up.
I love how Josh would spend hours upon hours playing a game just so he could make something nightmarish
I swear if i hear him say gander again I'll punch someone
WYSI
it’s amazing how much time and effort he puts into these videos, well done.
It never fails to amaze me quite how much traffic you get lol it's not like you don't deserve it but damn man, an upload every few months and carbon copy content and you still smash it 🤙👌
Been awhile since he's created a tornado monstrosity and I didn't think Raft would be the game to do it in
He literally played the floor is lava the whole time 😂
hey devs josh picked up your game again, that means you have bugs to fix 😁
Wow.... just wow.
My internet went down and I couldn't watch this video, but luckily I had 100,000 planks and I clipped my way to my ISP and they fixed it out of terror.
Plankzone from the Credibles movie
Josh is abusing physics to speed run the game. Holy jesus this man needs a Nobel prize
First conveyor beltnado now this?!
your mic limiter is a touch too hot
Yaaay new vid
its feels so long :')
“Hey there it’s Josh welcome back to slaughtering a video game for fun 😀”
the tornado from satisfactory is back!!!!
Yeet
omg yes
Josh is probably a blessing to the speedrunning community
my furry community in a nutshell
Yeet
Why does grace eat your raft when Josh litter
Tip: The top left button under escape, the button with ^ and ° on it, if you press it, it will automatically make you sprint until you press it again or any movement button
Hope you guys are doing good 😋
оh no, no no no
Hello
Imagine you're a guy just chillin in your own little utopia, and then some creep comes in, summing planks he walks on, just being the biggest anarchist of all time while ignoring physics. At that point you've seen literally all
Grace is as lively as always I see
1129th!!!!!!!
Delightful
Some how im always surprised by how much havoc Josh can wreck on a game
Shark? SHARK??? Her name is Grace!
finally
Beat the end of game , but without spoiler on how you SHOULD do it.
It eas like 2 min and he break the game lol
This is 1000x worse than I thought
You could say that Josh is The god of mischief of video games
beautiful
Yes favorite chaotic yet entertaining josh is finally uploading again!
Josh? Who hurt you?
Josh, let me just say, you are the best youtuber ever. You care about your community, you make the best videos, you make the wait worth it and you never ask for a like and sub. You truly are awesome.
You sound like a younger version of the Postal Dude
"the game wants us to go this way, but let's go this way and scare the crap out of him" hahaha I love these videos
I just found your channel a few days ago. I have been binge watching your videos. Thank you for all these great videos. Keep up the great work!!!
a new day a new rule
I feel like this guy should really play subnautica
i have yet to watch the entire video but... did he un-name the shark?
Thanks, I didn't know I wanted a crossover between satisfactory and raft, but I certainly did.
Tornado look like satisfactory
The first minute of the video was absolutely hilarious!
Spiffing brit: Finally! A worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!
John insanity is like brink of exploding
The Last Boardbender
Josh should probably be arrested in every single universe
i mised ur videos
Remember mcdem shoulders
Imagine josh made a video about real life
Ohhh my Lord 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Destroying the utopia he glitches his way through building is the perfect conclusion
This was a great journey lol
new video lets go :D
When ever he uploads game devs tremble if fear
Yes
Watching you play this game both amazes me and hurts me.
Yes
What can we say? World Saved!
I am so impress with josh dedication
This is amazing
All of your videos are wonderful, but you using the same exploit to basically skip the entire game is hilarious, I think this is probably the hardest I have ever laughed at one of your videos, well done.
Lol everything you make just evolves into tornadoes
Haha
I think this counts as a speedrun.
Hi
Hi hi
And here I am, still waiting on more rise of ages :(
Hi hi there
Hi hi
Hi
I think we have a proof here. "If possible and given the option, Josh will make a tornado out of it."
Amazing.
Yo make more vids I miss you I was watching your old vids
You should play people playground
WOODEN PLANKS, SON THEY HARDEN IN RESPONSE TO JOSHES DESIRE TO BREAK REALITY AND GO THROUGH WALLS
« Wait a minute, let me go get my tools » a.k.a. breaking reality and getting through walls with moving planks!
i like how he plays the full game and doosnt spoil any of the puzels
The fact this is so chaotic something tells me he should be playing with Smi77y, Markeplier, and Mattpat
This raft is the reason electricity and gas is expensive
Best video I've seen for a long time! Keep up the good work !
What is it with you and horrifying tornado shaped construction
Sooner or later he’s going to have a wanted sign in every game
Anyone know If this games coming to xbox?
That tornado raft was very... satisfactory. ;)
Commenting for the algorithm
Everyone here just loves chaos :)
I love this so much
Jaj LetsGameItOut Again
new raft video just dropped  >:) Thank you josh
The title wasn't lying
Is there some cheat that removes build requirements? He has no resource collectors, and I doubt he gathered them all manually.
I want a montage of every tornado Josh has made during his reign of chaos.
I'm a simple man, I see Josh upload, I click, I expect disaster, I get something worse, I then again remember it's Josh, I Click like, I leave, I refuse to elaborate further .  " When Josh gives you lemon, I feel sorry for you"
Your dedication is amazing
One day josh is gonna make the real world run at one frame per year
That was wonderful!
Already 1k comments
Yes raft
Forbidden expresso😭
Bro is to far gone it’s like little bits of his soul is leaving in every video am I wrong?
I love you and you’re work you remind me of myself
You are getting mango in a palm tree 🤣🤣🤣
AAAAAAAA ITS FINALLY HERE YESYESYESYES
An eldritch abomination of boards, broken physics, and sequence breaking. The raft itself has become the Josh of its universe.
It feels so good to see josh upload a new video after a month of not uploading…
I’am so happy for this video, but I don’t know how to express this happiness, so I will say in Italian. Per citare un gran maestro: “godo come un riccio appena nato, porco dio”
Wonderful ending
Imagine getting on a boat and hearing: Hey there its josh welcome back to lets game it out! Edit:Why does this have 48 likes
Josh is the true embodiment of chaos and I have to just say "Goddamn it Josh" anytime he does something chaotic
Every fabric of reality they will know fear. Of josh
Josh has given people a new reason to play games: to see their limits
Josh if u see this (not likely) do u like my pfp
HE SBACK
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I opened the video seeing a bunch of rafts and long collection platforms and thought to myself, oh lord here we go again. What is going on now. 😆
HOW
ah my day has been made
I'm leaving this comment here so after a month or a year when someone likes it, I get reminded of this best funny game play❤
I wonder how many poor game devs you've driven to madness, alcoholism or worse. 😂
Josh has so much time on his hands.
Play elden ring for pain
I never heard Josh laughed as hard as 29:08
mmmmmmm
Gamedevs: *agonized screaming*
Yes! Another chaotic episode on a "tiny" raft!
Whenever josh says give me a few minutes you know something dumb is about to happen
With all these exploits I think Josh will force the developers to wake up and work again after releasing said "last chapter" lmao
Oh no Josh...what have you done?!
this man really trolls every developer
Let's game it out Is like graystillplays but on steroid
amazing! XD
After a month, thank you for keep update bro
5:35 its trying to spell “HELP”
Hi
500th comment
If you like raft, you should keep Life Not Supported on your radar!
30 minutes of Josh breaking hell loose? Sign me up!
I am legitimately shocked that this game still runs with boardnado and all of the other floating trails everywhere, plus all of the other stuff that's actually SUPPOSED to happen.  I expected you to be down to <10 FPS immediately.
Once you hear "its Josh" you know you'll experience nightmares
1000th comment
Yeeeeshh
This is how standard construction works. If you can't reach it, just use some decoration wood planks.
Nice work Love it
ALREADY 1K COMMENTS?!?!??!
YOURE BACK!
Let’s gooo
re
This man's dedication is awe inspiring
Im here
More pleaseeeeeeeeeee
Grace is a good shark.
Wow you gained so many subs!
Every time josh plays a game he makes it way better, by adding 1000 of a single item for transportation, beautiful artwork!
just perfect.... ;)
Finally new video
YES A NEW RAFT EPISODE
He’s always so creative in the worst way
30 minutes ago* IM FINALLY EARLY
Wow, Grace has really missed you.
"Honey wake up!!!, Josh posted a video"
OMG I love this channel. The smart, quick jokes make these videos 10x better!
Hey there its Josh welcome back to lets game it out is a sign of danger
Final chapter is too OP
They added nukes to satisfactory btw, in case you missed it.
This man is insane
New fortnite update looks sick
2:57 lets game it out: *builds a giant tower full of supplies* grace: *eats the tower* lets game it out: BRUH GET THE HECK OFF MY RAFT
Yes
you know its chaotic when its 30 minutes long, longest vid i've ever seen!
yeees i have been waiting for you to upload
Ah, the tornado construction. Or as we call it around here 'The Josh'.
That actually looked really good with all the string lights IMO!
Josh is crazy
Patience is key But dam is his patience broken or what
Why isnt it grace anymore? Why is it only "shark". Wasnt it family friendly enough? Loved the comments of a Grace user before All that.
yes the good old original raft!
*video* lol
Finally got a new video to in my favorite channel
Josh, Why?
me trying to imagine what chaos will happen:
Have you played goat simulator? It was made by the people who made satisfactory
Uh oh another lets game it video.. we know how that goooeees~
So glad he shared the glory of the tornado from satisfactory to this game
I'm actually amazed josh can always find something to make a game fun everytime
hell yeah another vieod nice :)
You cured my boardom
Whenever Josh uploads:   This is where the fun begins
I'm convinced you must be a time wizard with how many hours you need to spend making these.
Yes
Am I the only one who thinks Josh and Smii7y would be a hilarious collab?
Yes
Oh boy, here wo go again!
Good I was wondering where you went lol
:)
Oh thank you so much for the content
This wouldn't be a lets game it out video if you didntnt break the game
More
Lol
*Plankmancer*
forbidden espresso
6.9k likes. Amazing
HE HAS RETURNED
Bro your like 2 months late 💀💀💀
Hi love your vids I don’t call you josh I call you doctor strange because your always finding ways to bend reality
Plot twist: Josh is the final boss
If only one could find stones on dry land. Unfortunately, one has to dive into the ocean to find stones. One of the first major issues of humanity.
It’s back!!!!
YES HE'S BACK
Oh god….
We want Johnny HotBody Back
I still remember your first video that i watched was on raft and I subscribed to you feels nostalgic to be honest love your videos
YEEESSS
I thought it could noit get  better and Josh proved me wrong. I liked it very much how one can break this game so hard and everything works out so well nevertheless . Good job
Oh my god released 1 minute ago and there are 920 comments
How does he get so much resources
why did you have to make the convert belt tornado again but 10 times smaller
Cheat engine goes brrrr
I show my physic professor this game he loved it 🤣
Pc boot up > Youtue> LGIO with another video?! > How is this game gonnabe exploited now :D
What's sad, is that you probably COULD survive just on the trash in the ocean  (depending on where you are).
Idk what to comment but here:    Hehe?
928th comment let’s go
I have a very chaotic game you can play its called sea of thieves
A new great video :D
I like how josh uploaded this video only a 20 something minutes ago and has 52k already.
if the raft doesn’t defy laws and physics, then it’s not a Let’s Game It Out video!
This guy is makes good videos
aaa I’m 23 minutes late
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
Ooo new video from josh. Fuuuuuun
I watch and rewatch Josh's videos. Literally my favorite YouTuber
Ive gotten PTSD from this guy from all he's effort help
Lets Break It Out
Josh:  *starts uploading* The spider in his pc: AHHHH IM BURNING HELP MEEE
Bro why do you do this
Where's Grace?
He is the god of virtual destruction             He uploaded after like 5 months
I hope they never patch this, this is amazing.
is he using a cheat engine for all the materials?
14:21 me trying to go back in my time machine to a time when the world wasn't broken:
When you see the thumbnail you know logic is about to be broken
Ah yes. Josh. You make me so happy. Please. Do the new planet zoo stuff.
OMG I LOVE WHEN JOSH PLAYS RAFT
Yesss more josh raft videos...  Thank you internet...
Those videos are wholesome, especially after a long day, thanks.
Josh greatest weapon is the "tornado" and it can destroy the reality and defying the law of physics
Yay a new vid
when I saw that tornado, my first thought was "oh no, not again!". great video
How the hell-
I want to see idiot by the name josh try and break spore
Love it
I THOUGHT GRACE ATE YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVENT POSTED FOR A MONTHIE! pin this comment because TODAYS SPONSOR I-
22 min ago ahhhhhh!!!!!!
22 mins its been out and 865 comments, do you guys even watch the vid
seeing a new vidio from you in my feed makes my day
oh boy its manmade horrors beyond human comprehension time
Josh and tornado 🌪
I love your content and it always makes me smile (P.S here in the first 30 mins)
866 comment  22 mins after post  Early
Josh I wish you the best of luck in creating more content. You are chaos incarnate.🤯🥳😼🧟‍♂🌝
Its a good day when Josh uploads.
Me seeing a new video on the Home Screen. “Here we go again”😂
Imagine one day you woke up and hear “Hey there it's Josh” coming from the sky
I seriously would love to see the raft devs reacting to your videos, just to see how you've mangled their game lol
Raft devs: I thought we were done with all that game making stuff but why we are going to work again on this game? We already made the final chapter. A guy: Well someone found some bugs in the game and we have to fix it. Raft devs: :V
You sound like if Ryan Reynolds was a psychopath
I want a reaction Video from the creators of Raft seeing THIS
First
Ive watched this entire video and he did infact break the entire game with 1 item in Raft
LESGOOOOOO
He should play subnautica
Put lights on the tornado
Josh becoming a speed runner now ahhaah
This guys never disappoints me
Hello Joch! Love you!
Mind you, he’s doing this all in survival
The sharks name is GRACE!
ah, the glorious return of the Hell Tornado
Yay a new video i have been waiting for one!
Me looking at the chest tower in the beginning. "I expected it to be taller."
Gonk!
I am so happy you uploaded. I was going to be out sailboat racing but I got sick and couldn't and have been miserable for about 5 hours now. Thank you
Most of the times you saw youtube thumbnails and goes, "that can't be happening, it's just a clickbait" but then there's josh's ..
Of all the exploits Josh does this has to be the most exploits in a video!
In the start when he said “owchie” it made me laugh
Yeeeeeees Josh is baaaaack and he breaks everything ❤
When the world needed him the most....He came back with more destruction than ever
It's kinda silly how excited I get for Josh to post!
this poor game has to fear being updated at this point.
Jesus plays raft
I love raft breaking. I love every breaking at Lets Game it out!
YESYESYESYES ANOTHER VIDEO
The new person jumpscared me to the soul
🫡😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
Me before watching What a nice day Me after watching THERE IS A GOD THERE IS A GOD HE WILL SAVE US!!!!!!!
if sharknado was a janky game:
The God of comedy has returned
Its always when you see a black screes saying "{INSERT TIME HERE} later when you know something is gonna give you a nightmare.
thought u saw everything till josh starts playing subzero with planks😂
Yyyyyoooooooooooooo josh wussap
It's terrifying just how many hours he's compacted into this video - those 100 trash cubes he showed for a few seconds (9:08) alone would be hours of work and literal THOUSANDS of resources that you gather one or two at a time
Who and why inspired to make this type of video?? Cause i love the content
It's been so long that I went from being a teenager to being a 60 yr old human
yes
Another day another mess to create
2:53 that was so unconvinently timed that i think josh waited for it to happen and edited it.  it causes me physical pain to see all that get destroyed, should probably see a doctor about that.
After the last episode, I’ve been desperately waiting for the next, and here it is!
LGIO can make any game, regardless how buggy it is, into a nightmare beyond comprehension
I was just thinking about why you haven't upload for a month, but eyyy another raft video
W
That intro always sends chills down a developer's spine and is a sign for me for a half an our worth of intense laughter!
YESSSS
6:27 That's actually pretty cool
13:43 thought that was someone
RCE will be extremely proud of that planknado!!
And 19 minutes is officially my record
Return of the tornado?
He finally remember his pass
why do i hear the jaws theme? 0:47
Hi
8 Minutes up, 16k views. U guys amaze me!
E
Josh makes us question the theory of relativity
when the game gives Josh that detail plank, I know something Grand is gonna happen
Josh is about to single-handedly make the developers remove an item
when the world needed him the most , he appeared
im a bit shock, he didnt introduce Grace .-.
And here we go again, my disorder
Josh, you need a Award of Game Breaker
805th lol
The wooden pillar thank  he made looks like your art piece
YES, A NEW UPLOAD
The legend has posted
lgio is my fav yt :D
Every time you upload, I get a boost of dopamine!
More planet zoo Mr let's game it out a lot of new dlc packs released
Huh. . .I am wondering. . .I wonder why Josh uploads so few videos?
Ah yes, my daily dose of Josh on acid
iT'S MY BIRTHDAY
Ah yes new vid:)
Yes more raft
Lets be honest, no one has finished the video yet and we're all just praising Josh's existence
It’s the baby version of the conveyor belt tornado
Josh should be an architect
This was just the inspiration I needed to hit the last chapter up. Loved this game and this series got me playing!
New Lets game it out vid comes:... Views:*15 mins past* 31k views already. Lol
YOOO?!
10:50 - dissing my boy the interrobang: ‽
I thought it said live laugh fail
15 mins and already 776 comments 🤣
Its exact definition of "random bullshish, go!"
777th also funny
Everytime I see this channel upload a video, I just know today is gonna be a good day
I am so hyped. i need to calm down before watching this xD your videos are always a pleasure to watch. <3
so much work goes into these videos and they are so entertaining
He’s BACK
oh boy, it’s another letsgameitout video!
758 lol i’ve been doing this for a whole year now
My joy when you upload 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
7:36 Josh: _uses an axe to wake up a crewmate_ Crewmate: "hey! a friendly face!"
Josh is a game developer's worst nightmare
when i got the notification, i sighed “oh god”
Letsgameatrout
Josh sees customizable building. Makes a tornado
I am surprised this video got like 30k views in 15 minutes!
Always when Josh creates pollution with crates, he always does something amazing
Finally!!
The thumbnail scared me it's like sacfatory tornado
Oh dear god
I'm convinced developers uses this channel to find bugs on there game
Always boring watching sandbox
i think raft has to be my favorite series josh does, please continue to make more!
Here before 1 hour tickets
Wow, a 30 minute video. Nice. Longer videos means more time to torment the game! And Grace...
Hey Josh! It’s me! The ONLY PERSON who’s ears weren’t permanently damaged from your last stream!!
I saw this video on my first thought was …Oh no Great job 😆
bleach please
Yes finally
Josh whatever happened to Grace?
I'm petrified every time you upload.
12:06 that tornado looks  like the one from one series josh made
How to break a game in one simple step: simply get this dude over
I love your videos
... the tornado tho
Grace the shark is back.🎉🎉🎉
honestly the string lights looked pretty good
I Love your video's and I'm so happy that you are doing your part three!
I clicked so fast on this, always love when you upload!
Raft tornado, seems familiar, Mabey conveyor belt familiar
You are the lucifer of bugtesting
lets gooo another episode!!!!
Gray can make every game fun
I think getting attacked by the shark is the best ending. You don't go insane, you don't waste all of your time, you don't even die. You're just "incapacitated" and waiting for help. Grace is truly the hero of the story.
Finally another let's game it out
Hi, have you tried playing Story of Seasons, Friends of Mineral Town? It would be a beautiful commentary and many people would be satisfied

Ooh a new video from Josh?? Me: Don't mind if I doooo
You should try Goat Simulator on your chanel because you can easliy brake the game and it is realy funny.
The thumbnail alone is causing me to break out in a nervous sweat...
It’s a good thing josh doesn’t know about the existence of gmod
I want a 10 hours version of "learn learn learn learn learn learn" by Josh.
Let's build a tornado raft
Ahh, I missed grace
I don't know how Josh's computer hasn't tried assassinating him yet.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE OH NO
I think you should do zoo city
Always excited to see the horrors that Josh inflicts on this game🤣
you r my fav youtuber because your funny and just chaotic all the time
I love raft!
Poseidon is pissed right now
The legend came once again.
Does anyone notice that this is the first time he's uploaded in like a year?

I love your content! It’s just the thing I need some days, and things I would do on other days.
me: it's time for sleep youtube: not that easy
"A friendly face!" "Ok lets not go that far.." Loll

Long video time.
Early??
this guy is litterally my favortie youtuber
"Now that it looks like a screensaver from twenty years ago." _Remembers screensaver_ _Suddenly feels old_
"Hey There It's Josh Welcome Back to Let's Game It Out" Translated - "Hey There It's Josh Welcome Back to Let's Play Games completely Wrong"
Nice
Josh always makes my day better:]
I love when a non serious game player plays games more serious then serious game players
I am probably lucky to be alive right now after what Josh has done to the universe
God damn you don't need that ridiculous hell to win, this man is pushing his limitations to infinity
YAY NEW CONTENT
LETS GOO RAFT RAFT RAFT
YES RAFT
Yeah, my day is secured.
574th
Welcome back
I have almost bought raft so many times since the last video, looks like i can hold out for another 7 months.
Yaay, I missed you !  But I know the longer we have to wait for a new video, the funnier the "Is there a limit to this?" will be.
oh look i'm early O_O
Man I've been going thru withdrawals from Josh's vids. He's back and with a raft episode at that, doesn't get much better!
Finally he uploads another video!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
When your on a adventure but you saw this monstrosety.what would you do???
"hey! Josh's gonna play raft!" "awesome! But not for content, right?" "not for content, right?"
10,000'th!
MORE RAFT AAAH JOSH
It's a good morning when grace bites you in the face
josh turned his raft into a sail boat with 3 miles of storage containers
HOLY HECK YOUR STILL ALIVE?!?! LETS GOOOOOOOOOO!!! <3
Whooo yess new video I have a question can you play horror game again please
POV: You hear “Hey there it’s Josh”  Me: SHUT THE GAME DOWN
Hi 👋
Hey there, Josh! Thanks for welcoming me back to Let's Game It Out. Glad to be seeing Raft's final chapter conclude but I'm even more glad to see Grace the shark again.
There will be a time when Josh breaks reality.
Hi josh
Oh my god it's a new day!
Here's to raft!
Mom, I’m scared come pick me up.
Pls play space engeneers
Let’s game it out single handedly made a 40 year old mom’s whole decoration plan on 1 wall
“Hey there it’s josh”
About damn time!
Ah perfect another hectic raft day
Day 1 of asking Josh to play Rimworld
And then an iceberg
*Devs HATE him! See how to break the game with this one weird trick!*
😂😂😂
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
He's back.
Hi daddy josh

Keep it going
Hi Josh, love your videos.
Oh hey he uploaded! Oh hey it’s raft!

Nice video
We all know that the sharks name is Grace, right?
Hello!
Nothing better than loading up a video from let’s game it out as you’re eating your meal
Yess
Whenever you hear Josh say; “Let me give you the grand tour.” You know you’re about to see nightmares beyond comprehension.
MAN! I AM WATCHIN FROM MY MOM'S PHONE, hope u see this comment!!!!
FINALLY WAS ABOUT TIME
YESS!!
BrôKEn GÁMe ÁMeS S
Just when I was thinking: “Josh hasn’t uploaded anything in a bit”
Hot Damn ! Another episode! I refresh and refresh and refresh again my notifications day after day waiting to see the LetsGameItOut logo!
The nostalgia from Josh playing Raft again after so long is immense

Here’s a recommendation if you’re interested. I think Kenshi would be a fun game for you to play! I don’t know anyone else that plays it and I think it’s be fun to see what you can do
Can you please start uploading a bit more on YouTube again? Maybe once  a week again? Please?
*When the world needed him most he returned* .
Oooh another one, for fun for all ages 😂
Finally another raft.  Edit: now make all of the rafts you made into one raft.
The only time Grace can actually fight back.

I’m glad I’m subscribed
