That camera 🔥 af clear as hell brahh this jam frfr
Jerusalem the dwelling place of the Lord Mount Zion. City of David, The Promise Land, The Land of Canaan. The sons of Jacob, the sons of Joseph let Judah be glad. The bloodline for the kings of Judah came from King David. The first king to rule over Israel and Judah. He was appointed to protect the health and wealth of the Nation. The Nation is the Land that Flows of Milk and Honey. The Land that Flows of Milk and Honey is of Health and Wealth and Riches. The partaking of the Tree of Life set the plan of Salvation forward. Life without repentance the word would be void. The plan of Salvation is the Gift of Eternal Life. Cain committed the first sin, when Adam Eve found themselves naked they made clothing out of fig leaves. God made them clothing from animal skin. First gospel promise Genesis 3:15 they will strike thy head that's patience Satan didn't capture Adam and Eve, they will strike they heel that's walking in his ways and keeping his commandments Satan didn't capture humanity. Proverbs nor the right nor the left remove thy foot from evil. God trust that can dry the Jordan River with his mouth. Balim false gods, confusion and evil. Paul said John the Baptist was a pillar of faith. John the Baptist and Jesus was cousins. John the Baptist baptized Our Lord Jesus Christ and Savior in the Jordan River. Joshua and the Israelites crossed the Jordan River when going to enter the Land of Canaan, Jericho. The crossing of the Jordan River symbolizes forgiveness of sins in the daily lives for Christianity. The crossing of the Red Sea symbolizes Our Salvation for the blood shed of Our Lord Jesus Christ and Savior. Hebrews 11:1 Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen. Proverbs 31:10 A virtuous Women her price is far above rubies. 2 commandment thy shall not worship any graven image the fruits of thy loins will be supplied. 10 commandment thy shall not covert.

I wonder when women will get tired of the exploitation? They are using your body and wombs for egotistical validation. You are nothing more than an object or collectors item. When women get tired men will be forced to stop.

Fat boys anthem…..finesse Ricky rose #wordplaywizzards💯
I hope everyone is doing well. I would like to share the good news you. There is only one God. “Within the one Being that is God, there exists eternally three coequal and coeternal persons, namely, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.” God is the creator of everything and, He is Sovereign over everything. We have all sinned and broken God’s law, such as lying, stealing, lusting, anger, and pride. God is Holy, Just, and Impartial. That is why when God judges he cannot let even one sin from anyone go unpunished and that punishment is eternal hell. We can’t work our way into heaven and our good deeds can’t save us from our sin. The bible says all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We would perish if we died and faced God with our own righteousness.   The Good news is that God is also Love and Merciful and sent his only Son to save his people from their sin. Jesus who is fully God and fully human, lived a perfect life and never sinned. He willingly went to the cross where the Father took the wrath that his people deserved and put it on Jesus. Jesus paid the price for their sin and died on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised him from the dead. God commands all people everywhere to repent of their sins and to put their trust in Jesus. Biblical repentance is a change of mind about Sin. It’s an attitude of the heart, genuinely turning from sin to God. Everyone who repents and puts their trust in Jesus, will have their sins credited to Jesus, and Jesus’s righteousness will be credited to them. Their sins will be forgiven, and they will be given eternal life. When it’s time to face God, he will welcome them into heaven because of Jesus’s righteousness.
Solid song, that’s pre 2020 quality of music.
