This cheatunv makes me so dam mad ngl😂
22:00 the smell of success 😂
What lake is this
Definitely one of my favourite so far! Please do another one ❤
Carl u need to go to Chepstow Mathern mill fishery bc me and my dad got here and I caught a 18 and a half lbs
Epic fishing in an amazing country
Nice to see these couples together. I get the impression they are from a well off family, these things are not open to the average folk. No matte, entertaining.
i live in poland i am trying to get some fishing gear but i dont have the money to get  i found a setup for 50 pounds (pike fishing)
Its mental how you've all been fishing so long and creating content, but yet some of the things you do and say are so noddyish 😂😂
My PB is 14 1/2 and I’m only nine and I have a heart of fishing. It’s just too fun for me to stop.😊❤🎉
25 seconds into this video... Is that at the entrance to Braunston Marina ?
This is a beautiful video, great couples and friendship ❤ even better fishing! Truly I think this has to be every anglers dream
Cal is surprisingly good at steeling things.
In france ther's matthew collins!🎉
9:13 you know what else is massive
Love the videos, I'm fishing again after a 30-year break. I'm now 75, and everything has changed. My son 54 is my Monday partner..his day off. The rest of the week depends on the weather, my partner is my wife of 56 year's. We love your videos, great inspiration, and entertainment. My missus doesn't fish but stays with me and nets any I might catch...Monday tomorrow and I can't wait! Cheers for the entertainment 😂😊
Hi there mate which reel you are using in this vedio. Like golden one ? Can i get a name and model please
Such Bad perplex and so unfair like how can you be so unfair and steal their Spot you World neuer win in you did Not steal the Spot
By far my fav vid.
gosh had a right old laugh where you and omi drifting and relaxing one of your films made  me get out again after 3 years of no fishing
What's the lake called m8
Another great video, I’ve only just found this channel and I’m working my way through some of the back catalogue. I’ve seen some of your older content the tutorial stuff and always enjoyed what you and your brother did. These videos are on another level though, warts an all. It’s refreshing to see you, your friends and family having a great time on the bank. Keep up with the good work, I’m looking forward to watching more content.
Can't stop watching Cal snapping his rod. Literally had me in tears 😂😂😂😂
i was smiling throughout 100% of this video.  Such a fun watch and amazing chemistry within the whole team, loved it. ty <3
Team Cal and Dani! 😂
Another great film guys! All of you having so much fun!! 😂😊
At 3:34 did cal say his pee smells like Weetabix😂😂😂❤I have watched every video I wish I could go fishing with you guy,you lot are awesome
U have to feel bad for Tom bro is fifth wheeling
I hate carp
u know how many time i rewatch this vid it deservers a like
Totally enjoyed this video. Keep up good work and videos.
znam kak ti je
Is dani from South Africa ?
love your videos carl they always inspire me to just get down to the local pond and fish even if i blank it just helps to get out the house(still think dani and cal cheating was out off order;)
Carl you do realise that that first "skimmer" you caught on the river was, as far as I can tell, a Silver Bream don't you? That's a bit more special than just a tiny ordinary bream.
I have absolutely no interest in carp fishing, but I really enjoyed that!
Love it 😁👍
Nice carp
Love this!
where is danni from?
I want friends like these. Good stuff guys
My daughter who is 7 is now obsessed with fishing and only wants fishing gear now for her birthday.   So we have made the plunge and she now is getting a full set of rods and equipment.   Lets hope this is a life long hobby for her
Not sure how true this is Carl, but I got told they don’t like pop ups in France? If I’m wrong I’ll be expecting it, but I keep re watching all these videos!
Me: Can we have Alex?  Her: No we have Alex at home  Alex at Home: 30:44
I like to see you catch a 92lb monster pike in Ireland  if there's any left, or one day catch a 350lb European Conger eel in Loch Ness.
So sad to see a rod break 😭😂
41 pound thats crazy good job ik this was posted quite a while ago but i only started to watch u and its been so cool
I would love say this my favourite episode yet Mrs fishing with you would love see more of this recently getting back in to carp fishing afther four years inspiration from you carl keep it up mate tight lines 👍 ❤
Amazing fishing from all some beautiful fish 👍
no wounder his rod broke he cant cast great vid tho
In the United States we have huge lakes come fish here
Beautiful place, beautiful fish, great video!
Fantastic storytelling. Well done guys and girls.
I’m late to the party here but where is Alex?
The switch-up at 17:53 was brilliantly done!
Looks like it was a good event, and a great location. Tight lines buddy.
Fish can smell the 😂
Why don't you get a bait drop of boat with a sonar it tells you where fish are depth , surface  and stuff you cath more
Hey I’ve got two questions, I’m new and are you Carl or Alex ? Also what bait or lure is best for catching fairly big bream(like big enough to have a decent meal) in Australia? Also I subbed and liked your vids and I want you to know that you are an excellent fisherman and that you should continue your fishing journey as long as you need😊!
Mystery lake is amazing but like you said, its a long drive etc. Were the other lake you know there is carp
13.39 mins lookat the eyes, how excited is omi,  love it.
This is the most wholesome youtube channel. Cheers from France, glad you enjoyed the trip and our big carps, come back soon !
Great video guys well done all😮
I reckon you should message Jeremy Wade and challenge him reckon your big enough and good enough at what you do he might say yes
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣loved when Tom helped with the wee bit of slight cheating🤣brilliant...Carl was furious....brilliant....so funny....great fun
Omi has the look of an excited kitten when you two caught your first fish....very sweet 😃😃😃
🤩 Promo'SM
setting up our swim is such a british thing to say, only in the uk do u only get a swim to fish.. and make the most of it.. where i fish there is a million swims.. fishing a small shallow lake like this  is fun though,,
Wowie, really fantastic video. Beautiful fish, scenery and great friends to share with. Good job
They should have  Life Jackets on at start off the video I see Carl and his Missus had them on
Fantastic friends and fantastic fishing,  Thanks for sharing.
Limoges le coin le plus perdu de France mais visiblement un bon point de pêche.
love it!
I always try the margins first, caught so many carp this way. Many people forget the margins and cast really far out. Fantastic video, really enjoyed it. Makes me want to go fishing now lol
Enjoy this video. Nice to see you all out on the bank together. Happy days❤
What an awesome trip! It’s always great to spend time with friends on the bank. 🎣
Great video Carl, i used to live near Limoges in a town called St Yrieix La Perche, brilliant video 🤙🏻🤙🏻
Great video but please, please, please wear life jackets in the boats.
My folks used to live there, beautiful place, peaceful and stunning!
what carp reel do you use ?
You guys should give it a go on the danube sometime in the future, theres really big carp (they are hard to catch) and there are also huge catfish (100lbs+)
yo mate i cant thank you enough youve helped inspire me to try fishing myself i love your videos so much keep up the good work mate!
thank you for sharing guys, realy enjoyed watching :)
You should try fishing at some of the lakes in anglers paradise in Devon they range in sizes and species there’s plenty to catch  and large ones to catch apparently the is a  100 pound cat in main lake and Devon record 55 pond carp was caught I’m cracking carp
more of this please!!! Always nice watching people enjoying life.
Great video 🤟
hey carl have you tryed fen lane near grimsby
Would love to go fishing in France great video
I like how you guys mentioned eurobanx Alan Blair it's cool to know you guys watch them to you and them are my main channels to learn about carp fishing
What an amazing place to fish again. Carl and you all were catching loads, too, and having loads of fun. Nice one, Carl 🎣🎣🎣😁👍
I put 1 maggot on your spot (just like that) 😂😂
How heavy is the is the spod? It must be heavy for it to snap!
😅😊
My name is not the accounts name but as I was watching this video I had a run on my left hand rod as I’m fishing in france
Hi Carl I've just bought Ur book and it's amazing u, Alex and Omi have done a really good job with it😁
Cal keeps talking about the lake being big. Would you ever think of tackling a big Scottish lake like Lomond?
great video keep up the good work!!
Looked like an awesome trip.
Nice vid I don't know how you come up with them😅
Are u from hull Carl plz reply
Video proof that Carl is just overall awesome. What a great watch!
What  carp rods do you recommend under £100 for rod and reel and what rig do you recommend for a beginner
Hahahahaha that broken rod scene was brilliant 😂😂😂😂
Great video really enjoyed nice challenge
Love you guys. I’m 58 and, dare I say it, a lifelong game fisherman. That’s probably because there has always seemed so much more to learn when it comes to coarse fishing. Well, I have finally bought myself a couple of rods and reels to give it a go. It still seems a bit daunting given all the varied rigs, techniques etc but I’m going to try and keep things simple to start (a bit of float, feeder and lure fishing). Hopefully I’ll bag a few fish along the way. Anyway, keep going. You truly show how much enjoyment, fellowship and friendship fishing can bring to your life.  You are also amazing ambassadors for introducing young people to the sport. Well done!
That animation near the start was lovely
What a great bunch, wish I could go back 20 yrs and do this with a few buddies, well done all.
I caught 3 different 8 lb chub on the river wye
Hey Carl I can’t find my comment so I’m guessing it didn’t go through but I love your videos and you inspire me to make my own and I’m wondering if you have any tips?
Top video best one in long time
Omi’s drawing skills are insane
awesome watch mate looked like yous had an awesome time the best videos are the ones you yourself can enjoy every moment of stay blessed Carl :D hope you and the family are doing well :)
I’ve been so excited for this video! Seemed like it was such a fun time!
These guys really traveling hours for carp that's craaazy
Wish I had half the fishing skills of you guys, unreal video yet again
Do you leave you line slack on the alarms or tight
Do you leave you line slack on the alarms or tight
If Tom had a GF it would be 2v2v2
I really enjoyed this video, it showed a different side to fishing, fishing can be fun and exciting but more importantly is better when shared. Great video and looking forward to the future video's
When they cheated video was not intrasded anymorr
Well done for the fish you caught and i hope you had an amazing time
Absolutely loved this, looks like everyone had a brilliant time!  I had one question, is the river that you fished the vienne?  I've been going to france the last couple of years with my 16yr old son and doing weeks on lakes but we really want to look for some venues where a river visit during our week (or maybe even immediately before) was possible.  Would love a barbel or river carp or even.... a catfish!  Cheers Jimmy
I live 20 minutes from that lake and have already fished there stunning lake
Hi Carl  I’ve just ordered your book I’m looking forward to reading it I am sure I will get some awesome tips from it thanks for all the videos you make and All the effort u put into it thank you from Reggie
What a great trip one of the best videos you have made better than monster carp lovely mirrors lovely cupples great friends just brilliant and funny we'll done on the pb,s great watch thanks guys stay safe ❤
Try the floating bread technique I caught my first and PB carp with it
Try bishisps bowls fisherey
Carl it would be cool if you took out some famous (ish) guests on a random fishing trip who don’t usually fish, a similar format to Robbie Knox when he does his “going on a walk with” series. Almost an interview like format but whilst fishing
Awesome video, smiling all the way through.
its crazy to see just how much inspiration comes from videos like this, i got into fishing through covid as a way to help with depression and i would love to be able to book a trip with friends an just enjoy some good times. Sucks i live up north as compared theres just not that much up here compared. love the videos, keep up the good work carl and team.
Hi Carl great video as always could I just ask what hook sharpener you was using plz
Really enjoyed this Carl.  Thanks for your efforts.  Hopefully you can make this an annual event now.
Great vid Carl ,i like the new style of content bud 🎉❤
Carl ... ^^ what about belgium ? Bokrijk its a cool pond and there are some big carp but tricky to catch
Is it just me or does anyone else miss Carl vs Alex 😅😅😅
What’s cals YouTube channel
Proper challenge and social well done 👌
Loved it. More videos like this 😊

Great video, you highlighted what fishing is all about…having fun!! Well done to all involved 👏👍
Amazing! Just amazing! Making memories doing the thing you love with the people that mean the most. This is angling! Thank you Carl ❤
I enjoyed this so much. Especially that little mushroom poke at Alex 😂 Carl please come to South Africa 🥺
im danis brother oldest brother lol, but im just saying when i come over there i have to tag along, this looks like wayyyy too much fun and when cal and them were here I got a small taste of how it feels to fish and im not quitting, so just a friendly heads up, great video i really love your content man 🤝
"This is our Job" how I wish I could say those words!
What I wouldn't give to catch just one of those Carp (and Barbel)... Such a pleasure to watch as usual, guys. Great fun from beginning to end. 🙌🏻
Love watching these fishing vids while out fishing 🎣 good job 👏
Epic!
What is Cal"s channel?
wow. love it! best channel. i see the work n effort in making this. thank you guys!
Great video. Been their in the first week of July with my Girlfriend and dog, we had swim 3. Biggest fish I caught was the same fish as you mate caught at 18,6kilo/41LBS. Next to that I also caught 2 fullies which were never caught before. (Total of 8 carp, 2 tench, 1 roach) The owners of the lake are great dudes and the food is lovely!
Hey Carl would 16 pound mono line hold 36 pound carp?
Good show!
Love the little dig at Alex with mushrooms at 30:50 👌🤣🤣
Well... Cal did ask "where's the bucket of water" for breaking his pb at the end 😅
Love your videos keep them coming 🎣 😊
Someone is pretending g to be you on the last giveaway amd said I won damm 😢 ahaha I was made up but lol these kids
Loved this vid. Great to see partners included....and Tom 😂. Does anyone possibly know how to find more of Cal's videos please?
Just wow. What an amazing film, I love how you deliver us the pure joy of fishing together with good friends, could not be any better. Love it! ❤🎣
Great guys! Keep it up! 👍
Can’t wipe the smile off my face when I see a new video ! Great content !
Brilliant vid guys glad the p b s we’re smashed
brilliant loved this as always lovely fishing the 5 of you all together just great
Pretty sure the "skimmer" was a Silver Bream, in which case, it was a much better fish!
Well done dani on your new pb .and cal yours .
Hi Carl, I love your videos whenever I get home from school and just don’t know what to do. I am always glad to go onto my phone and find one of your videos. You have inspired me so much to persevere and carry on even through all of the barriers that stand. In my way, your videos always bring a smile to my face. Keep up the good work.😁😁😁
How sweet pffffft
Amazing film beautiful fish beautiful photography and great friends  perfect...
You should do a sea fishing competition with 14ft beach casters that would make an interesting video
I've been watching your videos for quite some time now. I just came to realize how weird it is that I feel like knowing you pretty well, but you have no idea who I am (or we/us viewers). Whenever I watch a video of you my girlfriend mocks me for waching a digital friend again. She's actually happy to listen though, because your soothing posh accent makes up for it - haha. Thanks for the video's. I'll be watching them whenever I can.
Love the video but I don’t like the fact they went in carls swim!
Awesome video!
Love the videos makes my day 😊
Hi Carl good video. Just wondering what is the shiny black and red reel you use for lure fishing and dropshotting?
Love this video, my Fiancée has just started coming fishing with me on our local day ticket. she's now wanting go on her first 24h session with me. I cant wait
Just a joy to watch this! So incredible, such a good work. Thank you so much for this beautiful view on our hobby. You are good people!  Greets from Germany
Duck that. Men need fishing to get away from the wifes!
Another cracking video! This month i went to Poland,my dad pulled a muscle while we were shearching for a spot,almost died to a poisonous snake(Thanks to my speedy  eyes I saw it and it was a zmiea)but we survived and went to the hospital to check my dads leg if it was ok but next day, we caught 4 decent bream(I lost 2☹️)and took them home 2 eat.  Lake name:Solina  And u need a licence.
I had a Smile on my face the whole video.  Love it ❤
"Not much sleep" when the huts are rocking tom don't come knocking
❤ this video. Promoting couples angling together aswell as laughs and pbs awesome 👌 👏  🎣🐟
Love how the ladies get excited when there’s a fish on 😊
Love how cal is becoming part of the new dream team , keep it up lads
What’s kals and Danni channel called ?
Bang on video guys!!!Enjoyed it to bits!!!Thank you!!!!
Amazing video loved it , what a trip, everyone fishing together in a stunning venue, EPIC !! ❤
They definitely cheated you should declare a rematch  Poacherss 😂
Good to see you back out there and enjoying yourselves with friends. Stunning location too.😁
Number 46 on the trending!!! Let's go Carl!
Looked like great fun .thats what its all about .congratulations
The production and vibe from this vid is amazing. Well done Carl, Omi and friends
Brilliant video guys love the fact that you have done a couples match..you said in the video that cal and dani have you youtube channel as well would it be possible if you could put a link up for it if possible thanks in advance Carl 😀
Visited that bridge earlier this year on my way to another river , it’s on my list . Back in France in September but with so many public waters who knows if I’ll make it their . Good filming lovely mirrors . ❤
Definitely more videos like this
You should swap partners....oh no, that’s a different activity I’m thinking of.
Hope there was no spawning on ya trip lads 😂
They cheated that's not fair
It’s always an enjoyable watch when you’re both fishing together!
I couldn't wait to comment! I love your videos they are so well done! Happy fishing!
Great video Carl and great fish including people, may I ask what Carp Fishing rigs did you use to catch these amazing fish?
Great film everyone , some really good framings Tom and Cal mate what a few days for you great to Meet Danni and Omi always brings something of the serene to all content I've seen her in and yeah you were alright n all Karl, though what is it that you do again? :). I feel like I haven't seen this said before but I think a big shout to your Mum and Dad is warranted Karl. Both you and Alex have such a natural ability towards wholesome content and the way you view the world around you and your relationships with other people and nature. I feel this must have at least in part have to do with your upbringing so yeah  cheers for the gift of your lovely lads Karl's Mum and Dad. The films are different to anything else on you tube in the fishing genre because of it except maybe John over at the fishing locker who has his son along for some content. I really feel like I'm on holiday or on a session with you guys and that's great storytelling and production, you've built a talented little team Karl , sometimes the hardest part of a successful business and your really smashing it with the content your putting out , well done mate and good luck with what's to come. Thanks to all of you for a lovely little trip to France.
Great video Carl. Can wait for the next. I live the content and contests
Great to see. I s Dani a Zimbo?
#40 trending congrats
What a brilliant video that's friends having a great time right there memories like that live with you forever trust me I've got many many fond memories of fishing as kids with my sister and our two best friends almost 50 years ago   You and omi look so good and happy together ❤
Absolutely loved  video.  So many memories PBs and stunning locations. Fishing isnt just about catching, sharing peoples PBs is truelly magical. Hats off to Tom for the videography, beautifully captured 👏

One of your best mate!!!  More of the same on your travels with this crew please 🎣
I don’t think I ever smiled more during one of your videos than I did during this one. Beautiful people catching beautiful fish, you’ve created this Carl … you did this! 👊🏻
As usual top class video folks unreal 👌
You guys are awsome, keep it up❤
Poaching is always a quality tactic 😂😂
You’ve made some epic videos in your time but this one is way up there with the most entertaining ones so far. Superb stuff and still hoping one day you can get out to Japan when I move back there.! Tight lines.
Nice one looks like you all had a great time, great fishing and life experience video.
I like yours  ❤❤❤
The oppasite bank doesnt evan look that far away 😅
Cool carl :)
I thought omi’s pb was the big fish from the moat ?!
And this perfectly sums up what fishing should be all about. ❤
Brilliant video it looked so much fun we need more like this not just lakes but sea fishing competition's as well it would be such good series. Can you please tell me the name of Cals channel thank  you
Very good video Carl and co, can you please let me no what other camera's you use for making such good shots and zoom's, Thank you
Looked like a good laugh that!
What lake is it carl? And how do you go about fishing the french rivers ?
Great video . I make videos near limoge  on #motofishingfrance ..   Would be great  to show  you  the rivier  fishibg  in the erea for cats and carp.
Awesome vid
Great video mate looks a brilliant location for a holiday that stretch of River looked prolific 🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣
Love this! There a fishery near mine with 3 little lakes and they’ve made one in the past year as up and coming carp puddle biggest carp at the moment in there is 1 at 21IB
😂😂😂 We drifted to the spot. Perfect 🤩
Great video
Omg Loves this video SOOO WHOLESOME!! <3  LOVE YOU GUYS! PLEASE COME TO IRELAND
What the hell a 41 pence carp nice catch cal
Also, with regards to casting, can you get reels where you set the distance of how far you cast?
Why is it that when you’re in the boat dropping rather than casting, when they go back the keep the rod tip in the water? So no wind nots?
Brilliant video really enjoyed it 🎣🎣
What is Cal’s channel?
See at the start of the video a clip of cal when u both were fishing on the river Trent right behind my old house I caught nothing in there pretty jealous 😂😂
True friends having fun that's what fishing is about great video as always love the channel keep the videos or vlogs coming total respect ❤❤
Brilliant video Carl 😌 you are an absolute role model xx

Better than watching Monster Carp!!! Beautiful, entertaining video.
Fantastic video yet again 👏 👌

Wicked video carl as always , is this the lake that you visited to with Steve brigs a few years ago with Alex ??
Great video,but please wear life jackets if your doing boat work! I know you are all young and fit but if you go in with all that clothing on in deep water could be problems.. Stay safe and enjoy
Beautiful video,  such happy days - beautiful scenery,  great friends and fishies  !!
Great job you guys! I’m so happy she finally broke her PB!
Nice friendly battle going on untill they pitched your swim😂 another brilliant video from all 5 of you guys 👍

How about that last fish!.don't forget the skimmer.....those stairs are perilous for a carp angler using bite alarms...

Love these sort of episodes and videos! Great fishing lads and lady's looks like you had an amazing time and some lovely fish!
What is Tom and Danny’s channel called ?
Awesome video guys and gals  Loved it
I am watching your video from India and your video is good to watch from which country you are posting from
I love your videos. The fishing and friendship makes my heart happy.
fishing your swim was shady
Carl I want to say thankyou for all of your videos, you helped me catch a pb barbel and today my first ever river carp so thankyou and keep up the videos. Well done to Cal and Dani aswell as Omi and yourself. Tell tom the filming was great. Excited to watch his next video. Tight Lines 😂
Sweet, Petri Heil!!!
Absolute legends! Great vid & quality editing!
i loved the video
I dont think i stopped smiling once whilst watching this. Brilliant video, thanks again Carl.
Best feeling when I see you upload
Great video! I really feel you need to adjust your “beep speed” need that Delkim warble!
Crazy these people on just a lake
Let's get it on!  I'm loving the competition.  The scenery is beautiful as always.
Loved this, can’t wait to get back on the lakes sat abroad itching to cast out 😂 tight lines you lot!
Good to see friends enjoying life together,,,
Just unloaded the car and was ready to couch it out and this is here 🎉🎉🎉❤
Fantastic video as always Carl!
One of the best videos You've ever made! Happy for You guys! Well done!
I love it! Beautiful lake and river, fun n friends, nice fish and a wholesome ending.
Sweet, always a good day when Carl uploads
What reels are you guys using
Love the dynamic in this video. There was a little missing when your brother left but this was great. Keep up the good work! ❤
Always worth the wait.
Nice job guys 😍
Such a good video! Really enjoyed Omi's animated drawings and the commentary by the others. One of my fave videos of yours and great scenery
What a feel good video ! You see so many now that its all about the weight and how large, but at the end of the day, its great just to be fishing , exploring and having a great time with friends ! Ive been in the industry for ten years and I get so sick of the bloody hype sometimes ! We fish Mirror Lake in Le Chalard, near Saint-Yrieix-la-Perche. At least one day we go to the public lake at Saint Yrieix and it is gorgeous !
Another amazing video❤🎉
Jacob said you and mummy could win this. Jacob mate mummy has never held a rod before lol 😂 Let alone shown any interest in fishing 😢 Maybe a good practice 1st would be needed 🤔
Every video better that the last one Carl. Keep on with the great vids, convinced and brought me joy to go fishing again in a few weeks with the lads.
That cheating is unreal hahahahahahaha shocking scenes xD
Awesome video. Keep up the good work.
Limoges is a lovely place visited the city a few years back and the river looked incredible.
1:30 in, blown away by the production levels! Always top quality content Carl! Keep up the good work!
You did it again Carl... Your content just makes me so happy inside. Such a great video, once again! Just a huge inspiration. Keep it up man, keep it up!
imagine cheating -_-
Did Carl and Omi fish 3 rods to the other teams 6? Or am I just confused...
Does anyone know the name of Cal's Youtube channel ?
Great watch and having a laugh with loved ones and friends always makes fishing better yes its great to have some alone time n catch but it just seems better when you can share some special memories. Hope to see some more collabs between you guys
Made my day already and I've been awake for 20 mins great way to start the day
17:11 what a amazing catch!
Hey, anyone know what Cal's channel is called?
Absolutely fantastic video as always Carl. Video/ series idea should you wish to accept it.  Omi and Dani do a week on a lake or touring the country, could call it the “chronicles of the fishing wives”.  I know Omi is fantastic at drawing, and assuming she is a brilliant storyteller, and I it’s them both being new to the sport/ hobby, it could be the inspiration for new people to fishing and also they could become the flagship for young girls to try it, showing the reason why us men enjoy it so much
Best cut, Best video! Greetings from Hungary!
Awww i absolutely loved this vid!!!❤ What a cool little adventure!! It looked so fun too! Everyone had big smiles on their faces and just really soaking in those amazing memories!!! I love that ! ❤
What a video
Awesome video! Only a couple hours away from my hometown. Going back to France tomorrow for a couple weeks, it makes me wanna go fishing if I find the time. I need more of these.      :)
Lovely video. Keep at it
Nice to see fishing with partners. Seems you had a lot of fun and enough fish. And I'm just half way in the video
Your videos are literally therapy ❤️
Has cal got his own channel now then
Love ur vids mate. All of em. I def want to see more travel. There’s this world famous lodge in Panama, I know it’s far but it’s called Tropic star. It would be so cool to see u ocean fish!
👌👌👌
Great video! Again! Thanks for inspiring my two daughters to fish! Mike

Excellent stuff as always and a great ending for all. Loved it. Looking at going to France next year to do a similar thing with the family.
What's Cal n Danni's channel name plz @fishingwithcarl ???
Really enjoyed this … Omi has such a calming , peaceful personality.
What an awesome episode and experience you just of all had, looked such a great time. Also enjoyed the small homage to Alan at nash aswell with the mushroom for your brother, not forgetting the snapped rod because it's not a kizan 🤣🤣🤣 loved it!! 🎣🎣🎣
Quality 💯💚🙏🎣

Great video, different from the normal format & really fun to watch. Well done😊

What’s the name of Cal’s channel?
Another great video Carl!
Lesgooo, Carl posted🎉🎉
I'm going first time night fishing next month, do you got any advice other than from your second channel videos?
Poor Tom fith wheeling😅
So did you steal your brother’s girlfriend
Looks to be a cracking video never knew Cal had his own channel either !
I don't know if it was intentional, but the song playing when Cal and Dani were hitting eachother on the head with oars, is also the song used for the intro of the great Dutch fishing program VisTV. Just some fishing lore I'd like to share
Carl u helped me to catch my first big carp by teaching me on fishing tutorials to set up method feeder and I hope u reply
35th
Perfect way to start the weekend ❤
You are the reason I got into fishing 😃
As Always the video quality is unmatched... Now my wish is to someday see you and omi do a Vs with Alex and his partner.
Love your videos! Have really been an inspiration to me starting my channel

Absolutely bloody brilliant! Loved it. Naomi has definitely come along with her fishing skills. So glad to see partners included. Thank you guys.
you're video's just get better and better, please keep them coming.
I was going to say I love Tom, Callan, Dani and Omi only slightly less than Alex....but then Callan's extensive segment mushroom foraging...
Really enjoyed that Carl and the gang.  Just what the Dr ordered.  Thanks for that Carl.  Tight lines and can't wait for the next one.
Wow carl what a run must of been really crazy looking at your rod just quit sitting on the bank lol:)
