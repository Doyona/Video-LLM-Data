Cody I am doing my first iron man in 2026! I’ve been watching this video so many times this year are decided to go all in!
I hope you stopped your watch
I am running my first marathon in two weeks. I hope in couple years do my first Ironman.
It’s my bday, 4:12 am, I’ve seen this video multiple times and recently seen it too. I’m bawling my eyes out
They could never make me hate you
this is so so special, this made me cry thank you for sharing
12:27 what’s the song with the piano???
This was done very well. Made me kinda emotional haha great job
This is such a great video to come back to. I don't know why but, it just hits me right where I need it, motivationally speaking.
Cody please come back
I’ve watched this video about 10 times already
You sir are an Ironman. Did mine at Busselton, WA, Australia in 2013
The Day I Became a Nonce
pog
Ironman and a nonce nice combo
I feel you man !!! I thought just me has those ups and downs, well done!!! and nice video!!!
god this made me cry
Rise and Grind
this is so good! so proud of u, cody ❤
I thought he was going to ironman  Yk the superhero
dude looked as though he hadnt even broken a sweat at the end
awesome
i love this video this is my favourite video in youtube
Congratulations Cody! This is so amazing and inspiring to me!
Cody immediately tearing up as he saw kelsey got me tearing up at work bro 😭😂
My dad used to be a an ultra marathon runner, a hood to coast runner. And I’ve always wanted to run like him one day. My first 5k is coming up in a couple weeks, (July 4th) I know it’s nowhere near or compared to an iron man or an ultra marathon. But this video has helped me become more motivated to run and do something like my father. I ran 10 miles a couple days ago, and it was ass. But knowing one day I could make my dad proud of me to see me run and hit that finish line is something I can never imagine till it happens. Ty for sharing your journey, and helping me get motivated !
First song is It's a Process by Mychael Danna from the Moneyball soundtrack
Yo Cody you are the mans man  . Keep killing it!
this is so rich people core.
my main takeaway was that cody ko was in port maq😭
Song that starts at 6:12?
The editing is beautiful and i am so proud of him
This video has me crying in the club rn
damn that’s insane rly impressive i could never lmaoo
This was so motivating, congratulations! The roads going to be long and rough but I hope one day I'll be able to be an iron man too.
I cried at how supportive your family is!
damn i thought that the hat his dad was wearing on that last ironman picture was the «energy is everything» hat. All that time, it would have been his dad's hat. Now that would be full circle.
Shoutout to the squirrel at 6:59
I thought you were making a RuneScape account.
Cody being as unhinged as he is and being married gives me hope lol, I feel like we’re kinda similar 😂
Why did this make me cryyy!!
The oppenheimer music takes the cake
Hey Cody! I wanted let you know that i just ran my first marathon with my mom today! Your Ironman journey has been incredibly inspiring to me, especially as a kid from Calgary who’s dad is also a triathlete. Coincidentally, I am sitting down to lunch now as I rewatch this video. Thank you so much for your help, energy truly is everything.
I love Cody❤ he's genuinely someone that speaks for all of us. His intrusive thoughts are what we feel and I just love that about him but he's also got a big heart and that's what keeps us around
5:31 Cody looks like David Dobrick
The Social Network score in this is *chefs kiss*
meanwhile someone you had over to your house once is like dude where the fuck is my hat
Didn't expect to cry but here we are
Would I be right in saying that to do a full Ironman, you need be be at the level of ""Athlete"" fitness wise?? I've a full coming up next year, and that's the level of fitness I'm telling myself I have to be at- an "Athlete".
this is embarrassing
god why am i tearing up?? lmao i feel so much joy and happiness for cody and kelsey. Their beautiful family and the determination it took for him to accomplish this. wow. just wow.
if someone can find me the song starting at 2:31 it would change my life PLS its on the tip of my fingertips
I've been meaning to watch this for so long bro.... inspired the shit out of me dude 😂 proud of you brother fucken good shit!!!!
Making me cry Cody
BRO CODY WAS IN AUSTRALIA? WHAT
Just Lovee...
Why did this lowkey make me so emotional
The way u made me cry lmao
Cool video, would’ve been way cooler if he actually became iron man
the back and forth between the childhood videos and the present made me cry oh my god
I never thought I would be crying my eyes out at a Cody Ko vid
Honestly, I have been watching Cody since like 5 years ago and it has been inspiring to see someone I look up to accomplish something so amazing! Thank you to you and kelsey really inspring me and giving the world enjoyment in all kinds!
This was a great video, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Thanks Cody! And congrats on being an iron man, you rock 😊💪👊
incredibly impressive congrats, however some criticism of the video- its very fast paced. Dont be afraid to go detailed or take longer. This felt like it was scared of losing my attention and kept it moving too quick.
Nut should run itd be funny
Ugh I’m crying 😭 this man deserves the world . I’m so excited for him and Kelsey to be parents 😢
I’m not sure if these kinds of comments are even that important or looked at but, you are an exceptionally funny person and this video showed me how funny and inspirational you can really be, I was expecting a funny video and instead got a deeply emotional and rewarding one, good job Cody :)
A fabulous documentary
kajillionaire soundtrack = like
this video slams so hard, what a fucking great job
My dad did 7 ironman competitions throughout his life, but mostly before I was born. it's amazing to see other families connect over this amazing accomplishment and all the training that goes into it <3 congrats cody !
Beautiful video. Wp, wp.
Holy crap this was so good. Incredibly well done. So inspiring and emotional
Such an inspiration. Amazing video
This literally made me cry
So inspiring!  I really want to do this, but im simply terrified (and highly doubt I could even finish).  Way to go man.
you training for an iron man single handedly inspired me to start running again. im so grateful for you
I can’t even put into words how incredibly inspirational this feels to see!
im watching this for the second time and it still makes me emotional ive watching you on youtube for so many years and seen just about every video youve put out so its always really cool to see you accomplish big things in life
What garmin is that? does anybody know?
This inspired me, I want to be an Ironman one day but I’m nowhere near fit/active enough to even hope to do it this or next year so I’m just gonna start by signing up for a run soon 🫶🏼 Remind me when you see this 😅
Your dad is amazing! I could do with one of those.
Legend
Jajajajjajaja great shit
I know it doesnt really compare but, my first wrestling match my dad came and when I won it was amazing because he gave me a hug after and said goodjob.
what CAN'T he do? love him
i cried, i fucking cried. that is such a fucking incredible journey. congrats ironman
Guys I really need some help what is that music at 12:25? I swear I recognize it but I cannot place it
this was so well made I was literally sobbing by the end. watching your journey training for this has made me want to start training and run my first ever marathon
does anyone know the name of the song playing around 12:30? the really pretty atmospheric/piano song?
"it's in normal mo" lolol
So damn inspiring! ❤❤❤
So Inspirational man, energy is everything!
i rewatch this video atleast once a month
CODY YOU MADE ME CRY GOD DAMNIT
I honestly watch this every time I cycle bc it just motivates me to go an hour, thank you Cody for bringing back my fitness motivation
I’m so inspired by this.
why did I cry watching this? there's something just so powerful about someone working so hard for something and achieving it.
im not crying you are
this is a masterpiece
holy shit this video is insane
Cody, I’m a big fan and I love all of your videos. However, I gotta say, I’ve been putting off watching this one. My uncle trained for two years for his Ironman, and he passed away during the biking portion of the race a few months back in September of 2023. He had a freak cardiac event and was one of the healthiest people I knew, only 50 years old. Watching this video has made me so incredibly emotional for a lot of reasons, but really it’s so amazing to see that you were able to complete such an intense triathlon. So because of Cody Trains.. and in honor of my uncle.. I’ve pledged to myself to make a complete lifestyle change and live healthier starting at the beginning of 2024. At 27 years old, I know my best days are still ahead of me. I’m already down 5 lbs and feeling so much better. You’re an inspiration to so many, keep it up 🫶🏼
Really amazing video. Congrats on all the hours. I can't believe you did a dj set in Vegas one month out too.
i am training for a local triathlon in doing it for my birthday actually , wow i'm at ihop eating after my training session and wow just wow ugly crying at ihop this saturday winter afternoon so beautiful
“What about your little boy😡” felt that😂
Why am I CRYING watching him cross the finish line
This is probably one of the best things I’ve ever watched on YouTube
This guy only doing coke on the run and no salt!!! legend
i consistently come back to this for the opponheimer and social network backdrop and just the raw and humbling dedication you have Cody. I train with these same two songs on repeat from the films and it just feels special. So in awe of you Cody, you are my utter inspiration both as an athelete and person. cheers to you and your future ironmans!
this made me cry
Just signed up for my first Ironman after 2 years of training. Your video came up in my search. Can't wait to cross the line too. Pretty amazing doc!
One of the best videos I've ever seen. Congratulations!
The moment you realize you’re watching the cooler version of the social network
honestly Kelsey was completely right bruh like can't you wait till after the wedding wtf 😭 completely valid point LIKE SERIOUSLY YOU HAD YOUR F*CKING BACHELORETTE PARTY *AND F*CKING WEDDING* *AND F*CKING VEGAS DJ SET?!?!?!?!?* WHILE TRAINING???? dude 😭 just what the f*ck WHY
…. Can’t believe I’m crying watching a serious Cody Ko video
This was so damn inspiring, I think im not doing enough. This was so good, thank you cody
Yo the use of the EEAAO soundtrack is beautiful
Within 2 minutes this is added to my own try not to cry challenge
Congratulations on becoming an Ironman, also this video was 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥insane production levels 😮
Thank you Cody for making this video. I am disabled, and this is not an experience I will be able to have myself. Being able to experience your Ironman secondhand through this video was both fascinating and moving, and in some small way I felt included. I unconsciously found myself yelling “GO CODY GO” at the tv when you started the race. I’m so happy for you achieving this goal, and shoutout to Kelsey for being a wonderful support especially with all of these overlapping life milestones in mind. Congratulations, Ironman!
I’ve been trying to train for a half marathon for several months and cody in particular has helped me a lot tbh
I’m so proud 🥹
I cant tell the seriousness of this from 2023 "its a beautiful dahyy, dont let it get Auwayyy" feels like a meme.
I’m not supposed to cry at Cody Ko videos.🥲🥲
Honestly, I had no idea he was an athlete… big congrats
you are doing so amazing cody!!!!
Why am I crying watching a Cody ko video
5:05 this is completely innocuous, but the song in the background here is “In Another Life” by Son Lux, from the “Everything Everywhere All At Once” soundtrack. it’s one of my all time favorite film scores, and the scene for this song is amazing. anyways good looks cody
This is the touching content I wish more people were genuine about
Amazing vid
Amazing video
That was very dramatic
this made me cry
this made me soo emotional, im literally crying!!! so damn proud and i dont even know you irl! but you did amazing!!!💗
Wow man, this was beautifully shot and produced. I’d love to see more like this in the future
you asshole i thought this was going to be funny why am i misty eyed
bro where all this FIRE a24 music come from
swimming is the hardest part no doubt. Once that's out of the way the you can push through the rest no problem. Bike to running though is weird at first haha congrats though man
i'm crying!!!!!
Great doco! Looking for to the sequels!
Cody trains channel should become a model train review channel now
Energy is everything
seeing cody’s number LMFAOOOO oh no
I don't think he realizes how admirable he is
oh my god I love him so much
this just made me so emotional fuck
What an accomplishment and well put together video Cody!
So beautiful! Loved watching the journey
You're so inspirational Cody!
03:32
That’s an amazing video and worthy of a like 👍🏻 (I probably like every hundredth video or so) 😂
knowing now that he and kelsey found out she was pregnant right before they flew to australia and he’s talking about wanting to be that support for his kids like his parents were is so heartwarming
ok i thought it was a joke and ended up crying
Seriously.......?? I did my first IRONMAN at 18. I was the youngest in the whole field. Was still at high school. I got one sentence in the local newspaper. I didn't have six people following me around with cameras.... Get over yourselves. 🇦🇺🤔
is this a try not to cry challenge?
i love how honest you are! good job cody!!
When I started watching your channel, I was like: ok, here's a dude with his girlfriend making fun of silly people on the internet. Cool, fun, yeaa... but later on I've discovered that you're quite a nice person with goals, a pretty "normal life", family and so on. Keep on keeping on, mate! ( I hope that wasn't too awkward, because my first language it's not English). Hello from Romania, Transilvania! ^,,^ 😊
Great great video!!!!
Why is this art?
Heck yeah dude. This is beautiful. What an incredible short film and what a journey for you. Havent been watching long but very proud of you, and happy you've got so many amazing people around you too. Inspirational, truly!
you're an absolute legend man!
We ascend together ❤️   Training for the 2024 marine corps marathon!
god damn that was fucking emotional. great video
what camera did he use at the start?
Dude, i dont mean this weirdly, but like....Literally have kids, youd such an amazing Dad
What is the music in the beginning of the video? I heard it from somewhere
ChOO ChOO
Why was this vid acc so emotional omg
congrats kody!!!!! that's amazing!!!!
Did my man think of the nuclear bomb equation while running or something
This is exactly a perfect example of a parent child relationship your dad could have prolly finished way faster hes done this three times but he stuck with you. These are things i wish i could do with my kids but i pulled a mucle in my ass and back cooking eggs yesterday so ironman is something my kids will sadly do alone 😂😂 you have a great fam cody!
<3
Dear Cody, i dont really have much in my life,i think i could do it if i trained. It would be a great accomplishment to be able to do something like that.
Why is this making me cry
I wanted to be spooked 😭😭
Mad respect dude!
Now Cody is the little brother who did an Ironman last and made a whole ass documentary about it.
what an amazing experience, your family seems so beautiful and loving!! glad you got to do this its making me want to train towards this type of goal as well
yup i’m crying
pretty dramatic epic morning routine video if you ask me
Bro why the hell am I choking up at the end of a Cody Ko vid... Goddamn thanks for the journey Cody, and well done!
I'm crying... why the fuck am I crying
Its in Normal-Mo... You know.
i usually am not a commenter but, this was an absolutely beautiful watch
homebody dropped 15k on that Trek
If you only knew how helpful you are to your fans. You got me recognize that training for an ironman would help me. I recently went through a tough breakup and have had no goal but i want to do this. Your honesty is so real and makes me recognize it’s going to be very very difficult but i can do it. Thank you for your content, I know you choose to do this and i love it. I watch all your channels, even pay for TMG because i appreciate you so.  Thank you for bringing laughter and joy into my life when i have none right now.
you don't look very iron to me
This the Interstellar soundtrack? Banger choice
My toxic trait is thinking I could do one of these, when I don't event think I could do a half marathon. This was really inspiring Cody, you're awesome!
He's inspired me to train for and run a 5k considering I've never ran like that before. It's a start
This is like people who have to post it every-time they take a icebath. Who cares make me laugh
it made me cry
Gahh this was SUCH a beautiful video. Like, actually brought me to tears. It's really cool to see this side of Cody and all the support of his loved ones. What a beautiful family. I've been watching Cody videos for years - Can't wait to tune in to Kelsey and Cody building a family of their own <3
please make more content like this. this was a great start to my morning. TMG4LYFE
Why did he ask for a coin though?
The fact he acknowledges that it is self serving and it's important to give back to those who helped support you achieve your accomplishments. Dope
Anyone else love Cody’s dad’s commentary in his younger clips 😭😭😭😭 every time he talked I laughed
choo choo 🙌🏽🥹❤️
This was so awesome to watch, congratulations man
This is some of the most refreshing content I’ve seen in a while. Been a fan of Cody since the vine days, but seeing him just be honest about setting a goal and working his ass off to accomplish it really made my heart happy.
why am i crying
Crying.
Did you do this like Cody from surfs up on purpose?
Amazing vid
I didn't intend to click on this but I'm glad I did! A happy accident as Bob Ross would say. This was beautiful. And speaking of energy, I really liked the energy in this video, you seem to be on a really good path. You also have a beautiful family.  Thankyou for sharing this.
Wait this isn’t surfs up
taking shots in vegas 3 weeks out?
this is my fav video, didn't expect to cry as much
Congratulations!! I finished my first half Ironman with my sister, mom, and dad a couple months. Couldn’t imagine doing a full
Cody is easly the hardest worker on the internet, he was planning for a wedding, djing, running a business, hosting 2 podcasts, 2 channels (all with consisten uploads), keeping up a healthy stable relationship, AND training for an IronMan is crazy
your parents are so cuteeeeeeeee
So happy for you all. Congrats Cody
cody is so real admitting its because he doesnt want his sister to beat him 😂😂
I thought this was gonna be about Cody joining the Avengers
When are you going to become a woman?
Such an awesome video. I do wish that youtube didnt have awful compression... Kind of killed the quality at some points- no fault to production though
Anyone able to identify the music at 12:20?
Respect💯
was he being sarcastic about the swimming 😭 wasn’t he a swimmer?!
not the fkn social network music😭
This was fuckin awesome
This is awesome! Very inspirational and well made.  I am a late add to your channel but I love your vids. You’re hilarious and seem so authentic. Keep it up ✊🏻
My guy is pretending he just created the atomic bomb with this music😂 Congrats Cody!
this is the whitest video ive ever seen
Congratulations!! My mom is an Ironman and it’s such a crazy experience to witness. One of my most proud daughter moments for sure! ❤
WELL DONE CODY KO
absolute insane missed opportunity to title this "The Day I Became Ironman"
what a video
why am I crying
Aww I thought this was about RuneScape
Didn't expect to cry at this lol
absolutely beautiful short film
CHOOO CHOOOOOO
Yo wtf is a gaffer
Why did this make me cry
Great stuff Cody!
CHECK OUT >> "The Day I Became an IRONMAN" by "Average Rob"
that font haha
the announcer messing up his last name when he finished is the real full circle moment
What song plays at 5.05?
I bet your siblings didn’t make a whole video abt this
We get it bro u went to Duke.
Beautiful video Cody, huge congratulations to you!
I am 2 months into training for next year and these videos are such an inspiration!
How many energy is everything hats did u find
Best YouTuber man, hands down, Mr Breast can eat me out
cody youve inspired me to do an ironman im starting training tomorrow i hope to do this one day
This was pretty cool... pretty lame.. but also pretty cool
I'm hearing the Social Network movie soundtrack.
You know Ironman dies right.....
So incredible 😭
coke-a-cola surprisingly is a great beverage to refuel with (if it wasn't for the carbonation). Coke provides you with a lot of simple sugars and sodium which is what you need the most when you're sweating for long periods of time while training.
Chills by the end! Congrats Cody and Co.
We love you, Cody
Well done, Old man! Inspiration for so many senior citizens out there. <3
5:10 editor you are the GOAT for putting Son Lux in your emotional part, even though its because its from the movie EEAAO, we still love to see some son lux love out here LETS GOOOOOO.
You still an ironboy to me, nigga
i love this so much...respect, brody
social network song 👍
i cannot believe how hard i was crying at the end of this. you are truly an inspiration to all. we (your fans), your family, your friends are SO proud of you. GO CODY!
So proud of you Cody!!! But the fact you went to Waco kills me lmao
As someone who wants to do an Ironman, you are an inspiration!
ok but why did this make me tear up
so this is what cringe looks like
The Oppenheimer edit is so funny
Incredible video!! Proud of you Cody!!🤟🏼
oh my gosh why did I cry. this is beautiful! congratulations!!!
The cuts of him learning to ride a bike  make me cry fr
I honestly think this is the best video I’ve seen from you! So funny and meaningful at the same time I ATE THIS SHIT UP A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE
Inspiration at it's finest!
Congrats u worked so hard for this, I can speak for the fan base when I say we are so proud of u♥️♥️
2:38 Trail Dicks
the Oppenheimer soundtrack omg
YAYYYYYY CODY!!!!
i didn't know that i could love this man more than i already do wtf cody
>
everything everywhere all at once ost, nice!
Beautiful, tears
Codys last name is ko?
The fact that Kelsey was pregnant and they had found out about it days before the race. So not only his parents were there for him but also was his son. I may or may not have cried watching this 🥹
His family kept saying "Wade doesn't ironman" until it was too much
Aww this is was so good!! I’m literally bawling at someone completing a marathon 😂😂
No, that's OUR boy. On a serious note, it does the heart good to see such a nice, supportive, and well-knit family behind you. <3 what an achievement. And, so frictionless, too!
im not even gonna lie this made me tear up
I love when Cody is serious. It makes me uncomforable but I kinda like it.
this is like that Drew Drexler video but actually good
Loved the use of the sound of music song from the Oppenheimer playlist. 🔥🔥
This is a cinematic masterpiece, and Cody talking about setting an example in the future and being that someone for someone else😭 did I tear up?? Yes
my plan was to watch this while folding laundry and now I'm crying? what?!
Cody this Cody’s that, Cody is just me dude
Keeping my body performing at the top of its game - Noel (Migos)
Beautiful and so sweet
This is beautiful
I guess energy.. is everything
Oh i thought like iron IRON MAN hh
Fucking loved this video. Congrats!
Is this just a coke ad? lol
You the MAN🎉
It's amazing what young, talented, good-looking, successful, smart, charming people with a lovely family and a beautiful wife can achieve when they set their mind to it.
such a weird feeling to be so proud of a stranger, hell yeah cody.
I love the Oppenheimer music
and you’ve inspired many more !!
😢🥺 Congratulations,  you should feel so proud. True athletes know this amazing feeling of accomplishment and that you trained your body well enough to carry you through. Well done 🎉🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️
loved this
I’m not crying. You’re crying.
"My taint hurts" 4:17 milf manor reference lol

social network soundtrack goes hard
It's the Moneyball and Social Network music for me, haha. But well done Cody!
Legend
the oppenheimer music god i love everything about this
AAAAH I've been binge watching your Button videos for hours on the trainer getting ready for Kona next month and to see just now you're an Ironman too?!!! This makes me so happy!!! Congratulations :) I must have been getting inspiration vibes alongside the laughs
til race? Today I learned race? What's with the spelling my dude.

This is like Cody Maverick from Surfs up
this was so sick thanks for making this
So beyond proud❤
Beauty❤ I adore you
why am i crying rn
Congratulations Cody 🥹
this is so so inspiring. Cody I have been watching you for as LONG as i can remember, back in your vine days. I am so happy of the man you have become and the lovely life you’re building with Kelsey. I don’t even know you and i feel proud of you. Sending you so much love on your new chapter!!!
I’ve been watching your videos for years now and this is the one that made me subscribe! That was amazing! 🙌🏼

Loveee! My parents are Ironmen and my mom was a pro and I hope to one day to at least finish one. It’s ppl like you that make me rlly think it’s possible. Respect.❤
you are so fucking cool
So my almost 20 year old daughter was over and using my iPad. When she left I grabbed my ear pods and iPad and got on YouTube. Your channel was still up from my daughter Jill. I kind of looked at it for a sec thinking who is this guy?  I scrolled a few minutes ago looking at your channel that my daughter enjoys, and decided I was a cool 50 year old Mom~ even though I wasn’t sure who you were. So I came to the Ironman video. Watched. Had me in tears. The closeness of you and your parents, how hard you worked to get to Australia. And you finished! Congrats! What got me is the video of you riding a bike. And then at the end you went on your Dads instagram page ~ that’s my  boy!!!  My daughter was over bc she was upset with a mini argument with her dad. She wants to make him proud. But damn, some dads just can’t get their heads outta their arses. So just thought you should know it all made sense on how I landed on your page and in tears at the end. Thx for sharing ☺️
this is genuinely the best youtube video i've ever watched
You’re an inspiration cody
Ew I’m crying
I litrly thought this was going to be a parody. Lol. Great job anyway Cody! ❤
I’m not crying… you are
Damn. Made me want to do an Ironman
This is sincerely so inspiring! Thank you so much
What a beautiful video!! I hope you’re so proud of yourself, Cody. I know your friends, family and supporters sure are. ❤️
1:27 finally we know how to pronounced it !!!
what a sweet video
dude you’re a fucking inspiration.
This is so awesome
proud of you all the way from ireland
Thank you so much for this video, it inspires me every day to work out. Maybe some day I can become a Iron man :P
The oppenheimer soundtrack
Congrats, dude! You all are awesome. Seeing your loving family made me tear up. :')
Just found your channel what a lovely funny guy you are, congratulations on being a dad ❤
Why am I crying to U2
Families who have home videos are always the healthiest I stg 😭
I got so distracted by the sheer magnitude of the squirrel in at 6:58
catch me cryin'
This literally made a huge difference in my life lately.  I watch every single one of your videos for comedy.  You’re my favorite youtuber, but this was so inspiring.  I didn’t expect this.  I needed this. God, I would love to meet you.  I have nerve damage in my feet and it’s hard to walk.  I finally got to the point of walking with a cane, and I’m trying so hard.  I keep pushing.
completely irrelevant comment but i listen to the eeaao soundtrack so much + i've seen the movie probably around 13 times so i instantly knew when it played in the video and it just gave me so much serotonin :)) i was very happy thank you for that!!
Wow, congratulations man.
I don’t often go out of my way to like and comment a video as most of the time it’s just background noise. But this video was incredibly well done and to those who made it, perfect. Cheers to more life
Why am I crying??? Congrats Cody, such an amazing accomplishment!
i think this shows no matter how successful. no matter how rich. life will always set you back to make you better. i think that’s beautiful.
The ending made me tear up. I’m so proud of Cody and I have mad respect for his resilience. Congrats, Ironman!
awesome cody !!
this thumbnail + title of vid scared me so bad 😣
The Ko family is inspiring as hell. Cody you are AWESOME! Good job Iron Man!
Kelsey seemed a little controlling from the clips they used😅
ahh mann i started floating when that Oppenheimer theme hit
I had no idea Cody was even getting into ironman! Seeing his running and swimming videos were incredibly inspirational, my kudos goes beyond for him!
why am i crying
Damn, this actually made me cry.💔
This was incredibly inspiring
Congratulations man!
whats the song in the intro? does anyone know?
Im so proud of Cody for pushing himself. This video definitely gives me courage to tackles my biggest challenges in life. I have been a fan of Cody for a really long thing and this just made me appreciate him more as a person and not only a YouTuber.
This could possibly be crea Tyler
You surprised me, this video is an art!
im crying. congrats cody. your parents are so special.
Goat
Wait, is that the music from Oppenheimer?
This is a fucking great video!
Thanks Cody, you inspired me to get back into running today after a few months off ❤️
That’s very nice Cody, congratulations! I shed a few tears
I was really sad to see that he used an American flag during the race! 😢😢😢 my Canadian boy!
Wait…. Weren’t you a collegiate swimmer??
"don't eat off the floor... on camera" lmao 8:37
I need Cody as my coach when I do my ironman
Geez that was a hard course for your first Ironman. Great work out there!!!
All while making the button videos
TW emotional
The Oppenheimer soundtrack should not have hit as hard as it did at the end! So cool, man, amazing job
i thought he was like the swim team captain
congrats man! this is really cool
that's my boy
This was a great video, I loved it all! I've watched it twice, great editing and direction!
Truly inspiring, I myself have never trained as hard but have only focused on work and have nearly let myself go. Seeing this was the cherry on top to get myself to my prime and aim for joining a marathon. Small, yet a huge accomplishment from a couch potato like myself. I am proud of you and carry on 💪
The production quality on this is insane, so cool to see the full journey condensed into 13 minutes
This is actually so cool and inspiring
Congrats my guy!
respect on the oppenheimer music lmao
damn im crying
cody this video is amazing dude, shi made me cry fr ngl, ive been watching the trains channel for a long time and this whole short documentary was just beautiful, nice job man
omg the vine reference @ 3:09
this is beautiful
Him doing a callback to his morning coffee vine put the cherry on top of this video 😂
Bro really used the song from the social network lol
Fuck yeah
When you said this isn’t about model trains it’s about trains eb and flow.  Don’t discard new subs   I was watching muder with my husband and he called you out! She did too.   I thought this was years ago.   The hike yiu did with your parents was amazing! Your parents friend was thr star. Cody he seemed to know/ understand how to keep you alive….. he was amazing. Is he single?:)  Keep training
We love you Cody!!
the day i became an iron man the family of iron man the hardest day of my life
I literally thought this video was about his dad dying or something. My bad. Congrats on the IronMan tho
I live in chattanooga, small world
13 hr flat time,  598 over all and beat mom and dad.
Congratulations for your accomplishment. Great work well done 🎉
Didn’t laugh. Cried.
God why am I crying
This is undeniably incredible and inspiration; however, I'm genuinely curious about the pros and cons of doing it many times like your parents? Now I'm certainly no expert on this, which is why I'm asking. But I worry that doing this over and over and the constant training require would actually be bad for you in the long term? Perhaps ironman training is very different than simply running marathons since you're doing different forms of exercise, but ultimately you will have to do each of those forms very frequently. I just know that a lot of runners can have major joint problems later in life. Perhaps that could be because that's literally all they're doing, and typically aren't training in other ways like you need to for ironman, so they don't necessarily work out other muscles to reduce this problem, but then again, even if you do work out other muscles in ironman training, wouldn't the constant running mess up your joints over time regardless? I'm genuinely asking out of concern and not attacking. I just happen to have an aunt and uncle who have had some pretty major joint problems, and required hip replacements and what not from their constant running and many many marathons they've participated in. while healthy in all other aspects, they obviously have been forced to give up running due to this.
CAN YOU HEAR THE MUSIC WAS AN AWESOME SONG CHOICE CODE
9:36 , your neck looks weird as hell cody boi
3:39 just a badass in a spaghetti strap sports bra. Man I have so much respect for you for doing that. You’re a beast. The home videos, and your parents being there almost made me tear up hah got me thinking about my mom, and how badly I would love for her to still be here and be there with me if I ever did something like that. It’s a beautiful thing man.  Stay awesome man ✊🏼 your little boy will see this someday and see his dad is a superhero
The production quality of this is amazing! Incredible story!
Wait I thought Cody was a D1 swimmer in college ? Whyd he say he knew nothing about swimming
It's cute that his dad's nickname for him is Co and he made it part of his youtube name by shortening their surname to Ko
i cried
This was so beautifully made. Congrats on becoming an Ironman!
Crying! Thanks for sharing this journey and experience with us! What an incredible accomplishment!
Can You Hear The Music goes SO HARD with that iron man montage 🙏 😭
the fact that his parents did iron man while being grandparents (Kelsey was already pregnant by the race) is crazy…not many grandparents can do an Ironman
Gratz man! Good training!
This was so refreshing. Beyond words beautiful the love your family radiates. Thank you for sharing <3
This made me want to bawl my eyes out
😢can you hear the music?
we are all so proud of you🥲
Absolutely sobbing
This made me so emotional

Man I gotta stop eating hot Cheetos and watching YouTube so much lol this was beautiful
One thing I’ve taken from this video is how much your parents have inspired me to do something like this for my kids… I’m fat as fuck so might be a few years but that’s lit a fire under me ✌🏻
Cody’s mom is a smoke show !
Bro idk why but u cried watching this 🤣😂
This made me cry, thank you for taking us through your journey Cody! You’re an absolute inspiration.

That’s my favourite ever video of yours. And a top 3 YouTube video for me… I laughed, I cried, and now I (for the first time EVER) feel the pull to do IronMan. Congratulations and thank you :)
Seeing your videos on Cody trains always helped me get enough motivation to get out and go to the gym
That's awesome Cody! Congratulations! A whole family of Ironman's now.
Perfect choice of opening music, moneyball soundtrack is goated
Congratulations Cody!!

the thought of cody training with his little boy and his little boy watching him race has be SOBBING
did cody just inspire to do an ironman? i think he did! congrats cody ❤️
Loved every minute of this, what a family ❤ I have a 3 year old girl and a six week old baby boy and the support and love your parents have for you and vice versa is inspiring! Love from Queensland, Australia 🇦🇺
Why did they use the Oppenheimer score
what an amazing family!
❤
Inspiring, so awesome Cody 👏🏾
The fact that he gets into an actual train at the end I mean…. Choo fucking Choo Cody!! Let’s go!!!

This was soooo great! I’m crying!
Everything about this is so damn beautiful.. Including the all-star film score lineup 🤯
Pretty cheesy but good on ya
This is so awesome. Ive been watching Cody Ko since he had 300 000 subscribers, and watching the arc in his character and the dedication to this goal is so cool to watch. Also major props to the production. ✌
Cinematic masterpiece! I was convinced you had thrown it together until the credits rolled 😂
👏🏽
This is so inspiring, made me tear up. Way to go Cody.
This Kody guy doesn't seem to know shit about trains?!
you truly are amazing! such a great person, such a great attitude and great family support and you recognise that which is amazing! i tip my hat off to you.
Good for you ! But I hope it was a one in a life time experience because I don't want you to become obcessed with that and destroy your body . I want  you to be healthy and active for a long time , you are going to be a dad soon ....if you want to surf with him when he will be a young adult ....
This is so inspiring, love you Cody, congratulations, you're so powerful
what a journey
i loved this so much 🥹🤍
Cody i just want to say…thank you! ❤️
this is the best thing i’ve ever seen ever
i’ve been watching you for years, it’s amazing seeing how much you’re growing, being a dad soon, djing, and now this! congrats cody🖤
Morgan G, I love you and miss you so much
Congrats Cody Koala...chzt...check.
using "can you hear the music" at the end was actually peak dude.
"To be that to someone... in the future" Your son Cody. You meant your son. I am sobbing.
Cody is such a role model to me, I’ve been watching his YouTube videos for probably about 4 years now and I like the guy more and more every video I see. He gives more and more reason to look up to him all the time
How in the world did you get the music from Oppenheimer and EEAAO??
This inspired me
So proud of you Cody.
how did he get permission to use the Oppenheimer soundrack
So we’re u masturbating during training ?
You’re a pure soul and deserve all the happiness you’ve been getting recently. Keep killin it, buddy!   People dream of having a family like yours, so happy to see.
yow that squirrel was insane
Him saying 8 minute miles when that fit makes me realize that the sub 6 minute miles we had to run in soccer were insane
iron man mode 🦾
That Kajilionnaire soundtrack in the back - chills
Cody you’re such a dope human being!! Congrats
I agree with every sweet and emotional comment here ❤  but “Cody *Kod-zick-juh* ….you are an Ironman” killed me 💀  HAHAHA 11:48
Incredible work on the ironman & the video! So much of my life has been tied to athleticism and so many of your struggles resonated with me personally, so it was really good seeing all you pushed past to get here. Congratulations on everything lately, loved hearing you talk about it!
this style of video is really enjoyable cody this was super cool !
We ascend together 😂
So moving!!! ❤❤❤❤
I don't know why but I'm crying my eyes out here after watching this!!! It feels such a personal win for a man that you are. Ugh. So fucking happy for YOU!!! And of course, kudos to the people who have been consistent with their support up close and personal! It's not easy to find a tribe that serves YOU or/and YOUR goal per se. I am genuinely happy for you and always get inspired by how you commit to things and bring them to life by adding YOUR element to it! ♥
Wow this made me fucking cry thanks a lot Cody 😑
the oppy music goes hard
i can’t believe he used the fucking oppenheimer music
This was amazing!! Congrats to you! 🎉🎉 you did it!
way to go cody!
I’m actually bawling my eyes out 😂 this was amazing to watch we are so so proud
Can you hear the music
This was such a beautiful video <3 congrats cody & fam!
cody i love ya man
Cody Drexler
Background music giving Oppenheimer
congrats! this video was awesome
I’m just now learning I have the same name as Cody’s sister
I just started running after 33 years of sitting around and doing nothing. im about a week in and can currently run about a mile without stopping which was a major thing to me. maybe on day on the iron man (far far in the future) but for now i have my sights set on a 5k
Amazing video!  Definitely made me tear up and so so funny.  Incredible that your parents did it with you too!
Got choked up throughout a large percentage of this video, congratulations Cody!
I’m not crying you’re crying
And I sit here watching this as my fat ass is eating pizza...i need to get off my ass! 😭😭😭
I love how this is so serious but yet you crack jokes. Never change. 😆
Damn who’s cutting onions 😭😂
the starting docco styled clips remind me of the beginning of the hit movie Surf's Up! (2007) "Cody this, Cody that, Cody's me bro. Let me be me.""
this literally had me doing massive u turns in my room omg.
So cool to watch all the codytrains videos and then see this
This is really inspiring as someone who struggles with fitness constantly Kudos to you, Cody
Love u Cody
I actually started running and loosing weight when cody started the Cody Trains chanel, both just happen to start at the same time. And i really looked forward to his videos because they kept me motivated to do my thing. It definitely isn't Iron Man training, but i lost a shitton of weight and am the fittest i've ever been so i'm very happy to *in a way* have went through the training with him.  Sick!
Legend!! Cody you are seriously such an inspiration, and you always seem to radiate this positive energy. Thank you for sharing this video. It’s really important to see the progress of things and how difficult it is with life’s set backs. We sometimes see the end goal and how lucky someone is to have accomplished that, but completely forget about how much work must go in it. Congratulations on all your successes including the marriage, baby and the Ironman. ALSO bring back THATS CRINGE with Noel pleaseeeeee ❤️🙏
congrats cody !!!!
Just sobbing at this. Congratulations Cody. 🎉 This was beautiful.
Congrats Cody 🎉
This shit is hilarious
I'm not crying you're crying wtf....
why did this make me want to cry… much love
Holy shidd congrats man!
dude I thought this was gonna be a video about your dad dying or something omg
I love the Oppenheimer music in the background 😂😂😂
So proud of you brother!
This was so well done ❤ Congrats on such an adventurous year Cody
how are you not extremely wealthy my dude. your videos, talent in cinematography is legitimately out of this fucking world. you sir are going to do great things and I feel blessed to be alive a the same time as you. keep it up man.
Not the epic Oppenheimer soundtrack and the fluttering of cinematic shots 😂😆😁
this looks like every video noel and him laughed at for years. but its cool
This got me in the feels man
this made me cry like fucking baby. please make more documentary style videos!!
Fucking love this, Cody. I never learned to swim so an iron man has always seemed impossible. Seeing you finished reignited my dream. huge kudos
oh hey yea this made me cry, proud of u
you are really inspiring cody. you are a true definition of when u do something u do it 100%. u make great funny videos and at the same time u manage to stay consistent to be an Iron Man. it takes a great powerful mindset and dedication to be one. truly respect you!
im gonna do an ironman. i'll come back here when its done
That was such an awesome watch
Energy is actually everything
A beautiful video from everyone involved. Congratulations on all your successes.
What’s so beautiful is he was there for his parents on their run as a child and kelsey was pregnant with their son at his first run. So happy for you!! That’s a big accomplishment!
Cody this is the sweetest video I’m so happy for everything that’s been going good for u rn
This was freaking awesome! I love how this was filmed with all the home videos. Great job for real. And congrats on becoming and Ironman! It’s so cool his parents did it too. What an awesome example!!
What? I thought Cody Was a professional diver or something… didn’t he go to college for it and everything?? how did he not have any swimming experience? Do divers not swim? Truly curious.
u know a documentary is good when u want to hug someone u dont even know
lol the oppenheimer sound track got me PUMPED
CLASSIC
Made me cry
i love seeing this knowing they just found out about their baby at the same time as the ironman makes the ending montage that much more sentimental
i would hate to be a fat person in this family LMFAO
one of the best videos you have ever uploaded Cody
I cried
Why did this make me cryyyyy bro
I’ve been watching you for years, and this video made me so emotional. I’m so proud of you!!! What an amazing achievement. Choo choo! 🚂
i literally hate exercise why am i bawling tears of joy rn
I'm not crying, you're crying.
This was fucking incredible !!
what an accomplishment, congrats! So you are finally in the right shape to fight the Dobre brothers
so proud Cody, what an inspiration <3
How big is your house?!
“What about your little boy?!”
There’s so much to congratulate you and ur beautiful wife with! So 1000 congratulations!🥳🥳🥳
This made me less suicidal
Aweee congrats Co-Coo!!🎉🎉🎉🤍👏🤗
Cried watching this with the flashbacks to you as a child
i cried
legit shed a tear this was awesome cody congrats on become an ironman!
Really fun story and editing, will never understand the appeal or hype around an Ironman.
The Oppenheimer music at the end
Why did I cry?
Everyone should try to be more like Code
This gives me insane surfs up vibes
cody ko- husband, dad, comedian, youtuber, DJ, rapper, ironman, short king, hobby horse specialist, Mr. Button   he is surely well rounded!
Im gonna cry, literally all my motivation to do my marathon is right here
you’re an inspiration cody
So proud of you Cody. Using this as inspiration training for my marathon!
Bro, you and your family are so cool! And now that you are going to be a dad, you will pass on that energy (energy is everything) on! The circle of life! Rock on!
Awesome video man. I loosely watch since the vine days and it’s cool to see the strides you’re taking in life. Thanks for the extra motivation!
feels weird to say bc i dont know you irl but im so proud of you! Huge inspiration to me in general and started a weight loss journey of my own after watching cody trains. I gained some weight during covid and down like 15 lbs so thank you. You are so talented it feels like everything you touch turns to gold.  also 11:30 did you use the oppenheimer music lmao
This was so amazing! You should be so proud of yourself!
So proud of you, Cody. I've been watching you since Vine days. I love to see the hero always level up in different seasons of their life. So happy to see it!
This was my favorite video of Cody. Really inspiring and emotional in the best way possible. Thank you for all your hard work!
So inspirational!!
Congratulations cody!!
Damn made me cry
I'm not a fitness or sports person and I don't follow Cody Trains. But this did give me chills. Such a beautiful documentary, and congrats on becoming an Iron Man! Mad respect to you, Cody. I think you're going to be a great dad and a wonderful role model for your kid. 💜
Didn't expect to be sobbing by the end of this. Cody is honestly an inspiration. Good job, man. Extremely proud of you
the title and thumbnail made me think one of his parents died lmao like wtf
Cody you’re such an inspiration! I’ve been a background fan since I was young that watching your videos is something I bond over with people I love!
Him saying "I hope to be there for someone in the future" and knowing they just found out Kelsey's pregnant brought a few tears to my eyes, ngl
Why am i even crying really??
Not me getting super emotional to a Cody Ko video😄 Congratulations man! 🎉
Omg that's my town of Port Macquarie. Wild to see someone famous was running here.
Ain’t no way i just cried at Cody becoming an Ironman 🥲 Congratulations Co Ko 🎊🎈🍾🎉
why am i crying 🥲
Aww I loved the edits of you biking as a little boy and you biking now.  It makes it even more touching and shows how important this is to you and your family.  I liked how realistic this was.
Who else saw the squirrel? Awesome video Iron Ko
Absolutely love seeing these type of videos on Cody’s channel, so much growth
I'm not crying. Like a proud momma. You are.... (I'm such an emotional wreck in my life. 😂 😂 😂) 💛✌️🤟🎽👟🏃💨
:)
:)
This is awsome
Damn this was badass and actually inspiring
Get it bro
I love this so much
I definitely didn't cry throughout the video.... But I am now weirdly pumped for trying to start back up on working out. Cody HAS to be one of my favorite YouTubers
Congrats, honestly. Smiled for the entire last two minutes of the video. Just a super awesome accomplishment and shows all your hard work was worth it!
What’s the music playing at 2 minutes in?
love this
This was so beautiful. And Kelsey has been pregnant since like March or April and helping Cody with all of this 😭❤️
Very VERY cool video. What an accomplishment Cody. Your outlook on life and this process is very inspiring. Thank you for sharing it all and congrats!!!🎉 ps I cried watching this
I appreciate the Oppenheimer music. This is so cool. We’re so proud of you Cody. Thank you for inspiring us.
amazing omg. loved this
This was so inspiring, on so many fronts. The love and support from your family, and the way you reciprocate it, is so beautiful. Congratulations on becoming an Iron Man AND a Dad in the same year, coolest fucking titles ever!!!
A beautiful video
The Oppenheimer song at the end, Can You Hear The Music, yes great choice.
this literally had me in tears 😭 so inspiring, cody. we love you!
This is so beautiful, actually brought tears to my eyes. I am so motivated to go and do something, anything, after watching this. Thank you for sharing your journey with us.
The hat keeps changing brim colors 🤨

The way my little brother doing something would motivate me to do it too lmaooo that is so relatable
Great video cody
His dad is so Canadian lmao “careful code!”
"Can you hear the music" while you did the ironman was too good
Funny & inspiring. That was beautiful, Cody. 🤍
I thought someone fucking died
This made me cry, so happy to see Cody accomplishing his goals even with all of the hurdles he had to get over. Truly inspirational
aw cody u were so cute as a kiddo! what happened?
If I’m being completely honest, Cody’s genuinely cool as fuck. This man completed one of the most difficult marathons in the world, is absolutely hilarious, has a Youtube channel and uploads consistently, had a #1 app on the apple store once iPhone began to take off; this guy is actually awesome.
This got me all in my feels😅💙 Absolutely amazing!!
this vid made me cry <3 so sweet. Congratulations Cody!!
Crying. You’re inspiring !!

So inspirational
Enjoy having two parents still together
So Proud of CODY u r a IRON MAN !
Been here since vine and have never been so moved emotionally by one of your vids (despite laughing until tears at most of them) Ur amazing
Ofc Cody likes Trent reznor he’s hella cool
This video is beautiful, I'm not exercising but I'm studying for a nation-wide exam and it's really inspiring to see your journey man.
And one day YOUR lil boy will be an ironman! 😢
this is so motivational. good job cody and family
how did the hat change colour so many times lol
Man what a wholesome amazing video.  🖤
i’m so proud cody this is so amazing
dude the end with the idea of u2 playing made me cry <3 (even though that damn u2 playlist keeps playing in my car every time i get in cause i never un-downloaded it after apple put it on everyone's phone) im so happy for you and your family cody
This is actually inspirational as hell Cody. Love it.
congrats cody! this was so real and so well made, it gave me actual chills. especially the bits with the Oppenheimer score. you should be very proud all around!
Cody is the GOAT
This is the best video ever
i would've never ever thought I would tear up watching a cody ko video. (im proud of u dude)
I love that your parents vlogged too.
Love the use of the Social Network soundtrack on this
🥹 wow, what a journey
actually crying by the end, congrats cody! all of us internet strangers are so proud, this video really shows how much you have put into this and what it means to you!! and that line about being that role model to someone else is so serendipitous ♥️♥️
I want to become an iron man to
What a blessing it is to have the hardest day of your whole life be a voluntary marathon
Bro got claimed by Oppenheimer
Mr Shallow is getting Deep with it 💪
Stellar film man!!! So happy for you!!
the sound of music playing in the beginning of the race is beautiful
Oh my gosh this was the most inspiring thing Cody, I’d watch a whole documentary about you training 😂
Oppenheimer music was the cherry on top, congrats Cody😁
Moneyball soundtrack is phenomenal
dude you’re an inspiration, you have no idea how much you’re motivating people with a drive to do better and work hard for something that means the world to them. I’ve been wanting to get more into the fitness journey of my life while also making time for the rest of my life and now it’s 2 am and i want to just go for a run and work for the shit i’ve been dreaming of. thank you bro you truly have pushed me more to get past all the obstacles lately and just push through into greatness
One of the hardest sporting event on the planet! Well done.
Such a great fucken video 🎉
This is so beautiful. Congratulations Cody!
Cody out here using the Oppenheimer soundtrack!
congrats Cody, ur an iron man with a heart of gold . congrats Cody, ur an iron man with a heart of gold .
I feel like it’s wrong of you to not have Dre Drexler train you
YOU GO IRON MAN!!!
this is the first codys vid i've ever cried too
this is by far your best video cody, thanks for making this.
What is the first song in the video? Thx.
Directed by Austin Ko
6:45 That's my Brother in the White Shirt!!!!
you are such an inspiration
Thank you for this
I’m… crying? 🥹 Just seeing someone accomplish their dreams is absolutely amazing
Although I HATE running, this is so inspiring and makes me want to become an ironman
I was today years old when I found out Ko wasn't his actual last name lmao
very nice video but the tears kept getting in the way :')
The Oppenheimer track in the background towards the end 😂.
this is so sweet, the back and forth from present to childhood.
A lovely video mr codes
Ya Cody! Good job man❤
oppenheimer music goes hard
I used to clean house/dogsit for a woman who worked full time for the VA, rescued over 30 dogs in her own home, AND completed 8 Iron Mans (it's more now). The fact that we walk amongst such people is insane to me.
This is incredible story telling Cody, congratulations
This is inspirational as fuck !!! Well done Cody 🥳🥳🥳
So..did you beat your sister’s time though?
As*hole curated the title and thumbnail to look like one of his family members passed away to get more views.
Ya but what’s the coin for?
live action surfs up
Big role model love you Cody
Caurdy Kolrczka
fact: it would not have helped, you would have 96% chance torn a muscle
i usually hate videos like this.... but when cody does it it makes me cry??? wtf? proud of you codes
I think this might be my favorite video of Cody’s ever
One of the best videos you have ever made! Love the comedy ones but this made me cry twice in the video!!! I love you and Kelsey and supporting always you two from the side! Thanks for sharing your story!!! Great video 🎉🎉😊😊
Wow, incredible video Cody. Extremely inspiring, thank you for posting this
What about your wittle boi 👹👹???
Using the music from Oppenheimer 🤌🏼
so proud of you cody 🥹🩷
Dude the Social Network score
this was wholesome
Hearing that clip of Cody riding his bike and his dad behind the camera is the most Canadian thing in the world.
oppenheimer
definitely thought cody's dad died based on the thumbnail
feel ur pain broke my back tryna get barrled lmfaoo
I'm so glad we're all here with Cody to watch his journey and progress. He's winning life rn
focused on the oppenheimer score in the background of this
Congratulations man. Drink a beer a relax. Youve earned it💪🏻
Even with the irony and jokes. You rule dude! Thank you <3
the oppenheimer score in the background made this even more incredible
In New Zealand, the biggest iron man challenge we have is Coast to Coast; where you run 243 kilometres from one side of the island to the other side. Biggest names I've seen who have done it.. is Ritchie Mccaw (the old All Blacks skipper) an absolute unit.  Awesome video Cody, go you! what an achievement.
Your dad knew you could do it. As you said, they really support you!
Why am I crying?😂
Cody is actually really inspiring, his ability to just do something without stopping is actually really refreshing to see in this world full of "just do what you can". Its not a bad thing to keep pushing yourself.
What a beautiful video! Beautifully done!
Crying this was so cool ❤
Hell yeah Cody!
Everyone’s like “Cody’s this, Cody’s that, Cody’s this.” Cody’s me man let me be me
Great video
To think I started watching him as a jokester and this wild parasocial relationship has led me to crying at watching this man crush his goals and dreams. Keep it up, Cody! 🥺💕
The Oppenheimer music made it 1000x better!!!😂❤
Hey Cody. Thanks for showing what life is like with ambition, curiosity, and the ability to do it all with a smile. I know how proud you are but I also know that sense of feeling like you’ve done something that’s made your family proud of you as well. You a real one
Godspeed grandpa
Moneyball soundtrack is a really nice touch
I’m a big fan of the Oppenheimer soundtrack in the background 😂
This was dope. Good job Cody & everyone who helped/supported him.
Fatherless figure gang , this one made me cry at the end. This was good
imagine crying at a Cody Ko video, tf is wrong with me - im just so proud of you man.
i never thought a cody ko video would flly make me cry
You think I wasn’t going to notice your editor used In Motion from The Social Network? Nah pretty cool Cody!! So motivational
a truly hair raising emotional story to look up to, well done and congratulations bro. you deserve it!!
quality content
congrats dude! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
the last part with the song playing again, cody that is seriously beautiful and thank you for sharing this experience with us!! it's a joy to see
not me tearing up at the end. god i wish so much love and happiness and fun and sincerity between you and kels, forever.
this is such an awesome feat, i'm happy for you man
Got me tearing up over here!! That’s amazing and so cool to see that family dynamic, you really did that!
choooo choooooo 🚃
you're so cool dude. this video's really epic
How much money (on average) does it cost to do an ironman? Price of coach, all the gear, nutrition, sign up fee, travel?
How many times are you going to change the name 😂 i've pressed this video 3 times now expecting a different video
Damn bro did two half ironmans . congrats Cody, ur an iron man with a heart of gold .
is this the Oppenheimer music BAHAHA
Cody you’re making me cry
Good job, Cody
this video is so well done. thanks for sharing the journey with us. It’s been so inspiring
This is absolutely phenomenal! The editing, the story, the sincerity, the strength.  Great work!
Love you.
What a good video Cody. So awesome
that was beautiful and i am definitely crying
bawling
never thought I'd cry at a Cody video. congrats, man. you're fuckin killing it
Love this for you guys! That will be your kid waiting at the finish line one day!😁
Did Cody ko just make me cry? Wtf
The Oppenheimer music is absolutely sending me
Wow this was incredible! I am not that sportiv nor understand why would sb do this but being so real with the whole journey and just seeing someone being so passionate to do sth is so wholesome and motivating, congrats cody 🎉 ❤
idk how you mix between this uneasy feeling of serious and ironic/humorous like I'm not sure if there's gonna be a punchline or skit somewhere  At the same time, it makes me feel like how for me instead of never taking things seriously and just going with the flow that there could be something that I could pass on as a legacy down if I ever had a family. Something I could strive for and then try and support and instill in someone else potentially. No matter who you are you can push yourself to achieve something awesome like this and then share in that.
First Cody video I think I have ever watched and I'm so impressed. Hell of a video and accomplishment. Well done sir!
Cody you’re such an inspiration dude
Hey Cody congrasts on the iron man and stuff but ive been trying to follow you an strava and you wont accept me so if you could that would be sick. I also run so we totally have that in common
Honestly I think you need to keep making these type of videos where they are like documentary style very cool
omg this was such a sweet, fun watch 🖤
SO PROUD CONGRATS!!! ❤
Didn’t expect to cry today :’)
Not me feeling proud 😭
I already loved the video, and then Motion by Peter Sandberg starting playing.
Damn that was beautiful, crying real tears😭 so proud of you Cody
They say men typically peak at around 30, he sure is it’s amazing to watch. So happy for them!
I thought this was gonna be a joke when I first clicked and by the end I was crying. Great job Cody! 😊👍🏾
Great video cody
This put a smile on my face. Im about to start working out fr
Congratulations cody for becoming a FATHER and an Iron Man in the same year!  I hope you get to do an Iron Man with your children in the future <3
love that he's using the oppenhiemer sound track
Cody you’re truly so inspiring. The amount of tasks you take on at once and succeed in them all is incredible! Congratulations to you and Kelsey you guys are gonna be such amazing parents! 🎉
I am legit crying, I am so proud of him. 😭
ENERGY IS EVERYTHING!!
This was insanely inspiring and emotional. I’ve been a fan of you for almost 10 years at this point and I’m so glad you shared this journey with us. You are badass!
when kelsey embraced you when you finished i could see how proud she was and how relieved you were and how safe you feel with each other
Proper inspiration
🙌🙌WE ASCEND TOGETHERRR!!🙌🙌
Such a good example for how men should be nowadays, we love you Cody I’m so proud ❤
changing titles and thumbnail confused me, thought its a new video
LOVED the inclusion of music from The Social Network :))
Heyyyy! Shout out Chattanooga!!!
So incredibly proud of you, and your growth, and thank you for letting all of us be a part of this!
Damn soundtrack from kajillionaire and oppenheimer is now the soundtrack of codys docunentary
Perfect balance of funny and emotional. Great video
Loved this! What an inspiration.
Congratulations, Cody!
This was truly beautiful.
The best video you've ever produced on this channel by far. More of these my man! (which means you gotta go do more Iron Man's, sorry!)
The Oppenheimer and everything everywhere all at once music made this
Somehow this has made me want to do an Ironman
You really are becoming an example to young men
crying at breakfast
Nice video so dealers got 12 and you’ve got 16, wyd?
🎉🎉so amazing to watch this! You are an actual inspiration
cody you got me crying in the club. beautifully shot !!! beEAUTIFULLY directed !!! i admire this crew in all aspects..but fr im training again after two years due to ED and trauma w running, you have been such a light in my challenging journey. i signed up for my first marathon in may 2024, i'm feeling great but so excited to get stronger. thanks kels and cody for keeping me afloat these past few months <3 (lmk if you ever need a female cinematographer or lighting designer out there ( pls im begging you)) cheers to you both i love ya'll so much
shoutout to the editors brooke palmiere and dan ferrara. please make sure they see this! they killed it in this vid.
Oppenheimer soundtrack nice 👌
Great Video!  Props to everyone involved for making a seamless piece of art.
the goat
Being an ironman doesn't seem that selfish now
congrats Cody!!
A
this was art! amazing work cody!
This was an incredible look under the surface of what you went through. Hats off Cody! 5am swims are where it’s at! Yewww!
cody this is so real, my little brother went cliff jumping and even though I am deathly afraid of heights, I had to as well, cant let him beat me
poor cody had to grow up in a family where ironman was a requirement.   i mean if his dad was a lawyer maybe he would just default into that, but instead he was born into the family of people who do the ironman. rough
thought his parents were dead bruh
My boyfriend and I signed up for a marathon after watching this!
that was beautiful
This was just amazing.
Oh my God I love this video 🫶🏽🫶🏽 I’m so proud of Cody man what an achievement
“Energy is everything” is actually a really amazing quote because everything is truly made of energy. This is one of the most important things you learn in metaphysics!
hell yeah chody
what a masterpiece
Right when I thought Cody Ko had a documentary on Netflix the YouTube ads came. Stop ruining content creators videos!
Such a dope vid
this legitimately made me cry so much 😭😭
Wasn't he a college athlete in diving? And he doesn't know anything about swimming???
This warmed my heart
Cody is the goat
Damn man fantastic editing and just overall really well done. Cant even imagine doing that!
I've worked at Ironmans for the better part of a decade all over the world and seeing people race this incredibly difficult race made me fall in love with the industry . I hope to do one one day! This video reminds me of why I've spent so much of my life going to these, working and devoting myself to Ironman athletes. Captured the energy perfectly! Huge congrats from an IM carnie
The use of "Can You Hear The Music" from the Oppenheimer soundtrack worked so well here.
Great job!!
6:59 my adhd ass couldn’t focus on anything but the squirrel behind Kelsey and I had to rewatch this part like 4 times to actually understand what she said
So you’re the only one who has only done one iron man
I saw you had a speed concept early on in training? Why are you doing the event on a canyon? The fits are completely different. One has a different each geometry. Did you have to switch halfway during training?
ENERGY IS EVERYTHING
This really shows you the importance of having a healthy and loving family. You can tell Cody grew up around amazing parents that set beautiful examples for him and his sister.
Wait he said he didn’t swim but he was borderline Olympic level diver wtf look up his past
Cody, this video was incredibly touching and is such a great reflection of your character. You are such a great role model and it was so special that you got the chance to share this experience with us. It’s amazing to see your family, Kelsey, and all the people that love and support you get to be by your side as well. We are so proud of all of your accomplishments and I can’t wait to see what your future holds for you next. Congratulations Ironman!!
Glad you did this Cody, Stay hard.
one of my favorite videos he’s ever made. i hope you continue to live your best life and keep the tradition of supporting your children <3
What an achievement and an inspiration. He didn't even say fuck that many times. So happy to see this man accomplish this incredible feat
Thanks for posting, Cody! It was inspiring in the sense that it shows all parts; you do the training, shit happens, you do it!
I'm a cyclist so I can ride a century no worries, but running and swimming is beyond me (for now). Doing an Ironman is so incredibly impressive. Congrats
This was amazing!! So happy to have followed along it all, proud to see how far you’ve come and excited for what’s in store next for you!! 😊
2:29😭😭
DARKER THAN THIS!!!!! AMAZING SCORE!!!! YOU USED IT PERFECTLY. DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THIS?!?
Are we just going to ignore the squirrel in the background????
why am i literally crying
Funny enough today's is my hardest day and i'm talking about my day being hard... you know
You’re such a badass
Congrats Cody!! Port Mac is my hometown, so special to see you take on the ironman there & your footage of the beautiful scenery. And it's Port Mack-worry!
Loved this video, might’ve just inspired me to do one
I love you Cody. I'm so happy for you 🥹🥹
We ascend together
IDK why but those flashbacks of little cody mixing into the current videos almost made me cry
I truly never thought cody ko would inspire me to be an ironman but here we are
I’m cryinggggg
Damn Cody, super proud of you.
This dude doesn't even burn
I’m not crying  you’re crying
cody is so realllllll training for so long to accomplish sm just bc of his sister😭 its obviously been on his mind
Never thought I would cry during a Cody Ko video... Congrats man
Cody I've been running everydat at night and lately I lost some motivation and honeslty discipline as well but watching your video was exactly what i needed. Thank you man
this is fire cody
THE BEST SONG CHOICE!!
I've Been training almost every day for 8 months now, I hope I can do this one day but I'm not a fan of swimming in cold ass water 💀
I’m so sorry Cody I just can’t take ur commentary seriously so I can’t stop laughing but I’m proud Of you my brother.
god now Cody's unborn child has to do an ironman too
Cody. This video is incredible. I love the format. This is perfect. Congratulations.
Just cried like a mf
God bless Cody
Damn, I didn't expect to tear up watching this.   So sick you DJ'd with Dillon Francis. Maybe more footage of the show next time, less running.
Fire vid Austin!
Such a good video.
Proud and happy for you Cody!
Why am I getting emotional ?!?!
cody this is amazing, we’re all so proud of you
Awesome dude!!!!! Very inspiring
Been choo-chooing along with ya the whole time - love to see the journey up on the main channel. LA -> SD let’s go!!
Absolute chills
WHY I ATART CRYING THINKING A PARWNT DIED
Amazing video
heard the emile mosseri track,, such a good atmosphere (darker than this)
seeing him cross the finish line and being embraced by kelsey made me cry knowing that they just found out she was pregnant. what a special and joyous time. i cant imagine
the oppenheimer soundtrack added to this beautifully
THIS IS SO WELL MADE!
why am i crying
Shout-out to that Ludwig Göransson Oppenheimer soundtrack at 10:01!
Damn what a video Cody. Beautifully put together and inspiring asf. If this doesn’t make you wanna get up and do something with your life then idk what will. Wow.
I don’t know if it’s because I’m pregnant but this made me sob.
congrats cody!!! this video was so beautifully done
cody using can you hear the music def made me tear up even more than i already was
the Oppenheimer soundtrack makes this so much more epic
“Can you hear the music” is a good song choice for that conclusion.  Congrats Kody, on this challenge and the next big one! (Fatherhood)
4:33 “And it’s not in slomo, it’s in normomo”
Beautiful
Cried a river 😭😭😭😭😭🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶

The popcorn shot had me in tears
as someone who can no longer run because of covid, this is a bittersweet, but amazing watch -- so happy to see someone taking advantage of everything their body can do for them. great job cody
Why am I crying in the club right now
When Cody was asked if he could’ve skipped the weekend in Vegas would he have. I was glad he said no lol
cody i’m crying
I love the spoof of how documentary’s are always filmed but it’s also all real
Very inspirational 🙏🏽👏🏽
Im sobbing this was so sweet and inspiring

“Don’t eat off the floor …on camera” Kelsey is really a different type of supportive 😭 god I love her
Good job :)
Such a good recap after watching every episode since the channel has started! Love this so much, so well made but still authentic
my ears perked up hearing the social network movie score
so proud of you Cody!
Did it even burn?

ENERGY IS EVERYTHING. so glad to see everything he’s been working for put together in a video like this. cody is always inspiring
you just knoww he’s talking about wanting to set that example for a future kid at 12:24 and knowing that kelsey is pregnant now..!!! this was so beautifully shot

Cody Trains is some of my favorite content on yt right now. So proud of Cody for his insane dedication and sacrifice, its so inspiring. 🩷🫶🏻🫶🏻 BIG year for my favorite, most frictionless creator
and now you really will get to be just like your dad for your son🤍 congratulations on everything you've accomplished recently, you truly deserve it.
ahhhhhhhh when 'can you hear the music' starts playing, LETS GOOOOOO
The Oppenheimer theme really hit hard
What I have learned from this is that Cody is always on the verge of being a fuck up
I’m crying
Why am I crying 😭😭😭
Wasn’t gonna run today and then I watched this and was like “…. Okay fine I’ll run for 25 minutes” lol
CHOOOOOOCHOOOOOOOOOOO
This is an amazing video omg I nearly cried at the end
This is an amazing video omg I nearly cried at the end
Havent watched in a while! What a good video :)
dude, what a beautiful video 😢 never expected this type of content from you but it’s absolutely amazing, be proud of this 🎉
i know cody does a lot of commentary and reactions which is what he's most known for but I've grown to care about him and his journey too, so watching him through cody trains and this documentary is super admirable and inspiring. love this
Glad I’m not the only one who eats food off my floor😭😭
Killer video, thanks for the inspiration. Huge reason I created my channel was because of CodyTrains!
10:00 CAN YOU HEAR THE MUSIC - OPPENHEIMER SOUNDTRACK
Gowan brother
5:10 EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE SOUNDTRACK

The fact that Cody accomplished everything AND stayed consistent on youtube is crazyyy
You’re an inspiration bro
congratulations my guy what an accomplishment
lmao at in motion playing 2:41
Lol love the Oppenheimer song
I wasn’t expecting something so profound, this is truly beautiful.
i’m crying knowing i can’t run more than 1 mile without feeling like i got hit by a truck
sorry i burst out laughing at the way they pronounced your name
Cody, I’ve been watching since the beginning, and you’re one of my best parasocial friends. This video was incredible and I’m so proud of you and all that you’ve accomplished. This was so inspiring it made me want to go for a run. I’ve never ran in my life. Thanks for sharing your life with us!!
You're just so awesome. We were all rooting for you and will continue to do so for all of the other goals you want to achieve. Same goes for Kelsey. <3
The Oppenheimer soundtrack👌🏻👌🏻
Teared up a little in the end, congrats man!
Yo you did an iron man?
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH CODY! Am so proud of you!
Nah bro is not mr struggle in life rn lol
literally cried watching u cross the finishline, thank you for making this video and taking us along for your adventures <3
The editing in this video was absolutely beautiful. I never comment, but this was incredible! He helped me get back into fitness, just like a lot of us. As someone who suffers from Anorexia I didn’t do it right and i got super sick and fainted hitting my head super hard but seeing this made me want to do it right. Cody has no idea how many lives he’s changed.
Love the video! If this was the hardest day of your life you have a VERY blest life.💖✨
Moving Cody. You Enigma.
can u hear the music
Honestly inspiring!!!
cody, people can only watch this and be inspired to better themselves and for that I applaud you! well done
let’s goooooooo
What a great video
Congrats Cody! Thank you for documenting all of this in such an honest way.  Enjoy! Thank you for using the social network soundtrack. Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor did an amazing job 💯
At the end when you ran into Kelsey's arms and just broke down with emotion, that hit me straight in the heart man. All the good feels. I've been watching your content for over 5 years now and the amount of progression you've given all of us as subscribers is so beautiful. Thank you Cody ❤  I've never had this many likes before and I'm honored that it was for Cody 🫡
Congratulations Cody! It was honestly inspiring to watch. And the fact that your family did it with you was super heartwarming <3
wOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Oppenheimer music slaps
Simply incredible! We ascend together!!!!!
why did I cry
insanely good content
crying at how i want to create a family like yours one day
Goarh Coarhdy!
This is actually so beautiful and made me so happy
Saw Brittany's story of her crying to this, I get it now  Congratulations Cody ❤
The ad for coins below the video is priceless to me and had me gigglin. Cheers Cody🍻
‘Energy is Everything’ is such a fitting cap for Cody
Choo choo!!
I like how your content went from funny to reviewing shitty dating shows to flexing your accomplishments
so proud of you and kelsey youre gonna be a great example for your baby boy on the way
amazing video cody
My dude's got real good parents 🔥❤
"it's not in slo-mo, it's in normal-mo"
"Cody can now ride without training wheels yknow" 😭😭
I can't even fathom how people do this
imagine if this is just a way to drop a new cap merch that says energy is everything
You inspired me, i WILL do an ironman.
cant believe yall got the everything everywhere all at once music
i cried
so proud of this goober <3
Been watching you for a long time and your videos bring me so much joy.
Can you hear the music * chefs kiss *
Energy is everything
The fact that this isn't titled "Energy is Everything" is downright criminal.
Damnit I love this man
I’m dying at the fact that they used songs from movie scores as music here
Been watching you since I was in high school and now I've just graduated college. I was a runner my whole life and a sprinter at a D1 school with no intentions of going back to distance running but after watching this video you've inspired me to train and run a marathon with my Dad. My dad has run 6 marathons and I watched his first one when I was in third grade. Congrats on this amazing accomplishment, I hope to inspire my children one day like your parents and my parents!
Love you 9000  Energy Is Everything
damn that was a surprisingly emotional ride. i liked the editing too
Cody the way the thumbnail looks it looks like your dad died.
Honestly Cody, everything you mentioned in this video I’ve thought about over the past 6 months while watching your videos. I see how much you are taking on, from training for the Ironman, DJing, putting out your YouTube content on THREE channels, and probably so much more. It’s unbelievable and it’s so inspirational. For someone who’s struggling hard just working 28 hours per week, this gives me so much inspiration and drive to achieve something better for me in my life. Thanks man for being so god damn incredible!
Anybody have the song at 2:05?
i thought this mans parents died.....
I know cody is gonna be a great dad. Why? Because just an hour ago i was crying about how i dont feel confident in my dance ability anymore, ( even though i have been dancing 1-4 hrs a day for years now lmao ) and now im watching this feeling more motivated/confident than ever 😭  this video made me realize all progress is good progress. Im in my early teens so lacking confidence is kind of an often thing. Cody trains has actually helped me feel more confident. Mb if this is cringe but cody is really inspiring these days.
Oppenheimer track went nuts
hell yeah bro, you did that
Man changed the title 3 times 😭 banger as always though. It’s been dope seeing your progress throughout the years man. Keep living life
you're such an inspiration
based on the thumbnail and title i thought someone died LMAO
That Oppenheimer Bgm tho 💯
this is not getting the attention it deserves
amazing
i worked 4 hours today and was soooooo tired after
This is the hardest video i've ever seen
this honestly made me tear up ❤ my sincerest congratulations on everything!! many blessings to you and kelsey and the sprout
I have no interest in doing an Ironman, but seeing Cody’s motivation and determination was inspiring for any goal I could want to achieve
The shots of him as a little kid on the bike are so sweet 🥹
cody rockin circa skate brand as a child I knew he BEEN that guy
Eyyy shoutout Chattanooga
ENERGY IS EVERYTHING
who knew I'd start watching Cody with the sugar gay video and end up in this exact moment of feeling awfully inspired and emotional. Congrats Cody and I'm rooting for you always!
And how perfect, Kelsey being pregnant with their son…life for some people can truly be filled with such beautiful magic. Congratulations. ❤
this made me cry, what a beautiful inspiring video of an equally beautiful and inspiring man.
You didn't get me with the first title and thumbnail, but you got me with the second one.
a really beautifully filmed video :)
nice congrats, also nice tittle and thumbnail change, I liked the other one better but the ctr wasn't there huh  JK awesome work
Not me thinking he lost someone and panic clicking😑
i am so incredibly proud of watch ing you grow cody
well i did not expect to cry !! CHOO CHOOOOOOO
cinematic cody. look at you go.
Cody, not going to lie - when I initially saw this was about Iron Man Race, I didn't give a rat's ass. But simultaneously you drew my attention and it was so incredibly well done. You've inspired me in more ways than one
This is all amazing but the icing on the cake? beautiful day by U2 🫶🏼
Best IRONMAN video I've ever watched
Inspired
I wish I could like this video 1million times
Freaking love this
this is surfs up coded in the best way
i love this style of video. so motivational cody, you’re insane!!!
HE IS AWESOME
Bruh I thought someone died. 😂 well anyway congrats codes.
damn, this vid was frictionless. loved it.
Been with you since Devon and Cody go to whitecastle. Your story is such a beautiful example of how incredible life can be. Thanks for sharing it with us
Need a white hat so might have to cop one of those caps also even though the podcast gang rips on you for talking about the race so much this was a great watch and we are all incredibly proud cody
I just love this so much! ❤❤
So gd good…im cuttin onions
this was mad motivational, now i wanna be an ironman fr
even though i know the sentiment  and journey is very real but i cannot tell if this video format is satire or not😭
i love you!!!!!! congrats!!!
crying happy tears. I’m so freaking proud of you Cody. it’s so fun watching you grow and succeed. ❤
the oppenheimer music going hard af
!!!!! so cool
Damn dawg, how you gonna make me cry like that 🥲
crying
It’s such a sibling move to do an Ironman only cause your sibling did 😂😭
If you don’t want me at my Mr. Struggle, you don’t deserve me at my Mr. Ironman
so proud of you cody
This is sick
I love how he don't bullshit us and try to make it corny and dead serious, he's just a real guy with jokes and that just makes him so likable, it's still emotional and inspiring
Inspired me to do the 2023 LA Marathon and the Santa Rosa Marathon. Cody you’re a legend!
The difference between this video and the codytrains vlogs is great
This made me so sad and happy because I wish I had a family like this
yes! cody became a racist
Cody this is brilliant! It’s well made and ur old so it’s inspiring. (I’m joking ur winning at life rn)  congrats Ironman 🎉❤
super inspiring! but weren’t you a competitive swimmer in college?
i love watching this in bed eating ice cream
This video gave me chills… so proud of you Cody!! Been a huge fan for 10 years now and seeing all the milestones you’ve crossed in the past few years especially recently with the wedding, baby boy and this is so inspiring and just great to see. LOVE YOU CODY!
This is great, man. I'm glad you took it just seriously enough. Pitch perfect.
I've watched this four times already, not only is the story so emotional and important to Cody as a person, but this film of it is done so well the entire message is displayed beautifully!
Cody this might be my favorite video you’ve ever made. The progress you have made both physically, mentally and creatively is so inspiring. so proud of you!!
The Oppenheimer music goes crazy. Great job, Cody!
Congrats, Cody! You’re such an inspiration!
This quite literally made me emotional, just the connection with your family and your perseverance. Truly beautiful Cody, congrats brother!
Why did this make me cry
Why are you not a voice actor?
Dude why you gotta be inspiring me to do an ironman.
CONGRATS!!! UR THE BEST
This is awesome
This made me so emotional man
Can you hear the music, Cody?
Cody this is wild! Congrats man! Maybe one day you’ll do an ironman with your baby boy!
Did anyone else hear the Everything everywhere all at once music?? 5:06
Cody, this is genuinely the coolest thing I've ever seen
Beautiful vid cody, watching you cross the finish line and cry like a little bitch honestly made me tear up a little. When i finished my first marathon i cried like a little bitch too, hit home. You da man bro 🥲
you should make a main character try not to laugh on this video
“What about your little boyyy???”  Sooo relatable
What a beautiful tribute to both your family and your past/future ❤ you’ve inspired me in so many ways this year, and I’ve enjoyed tagging along… you deserve to feel every ounce of pride that comes along with conquering this incredible feat. what an amazing legacy to share with your family and inspire thousands of people with every step 🎉
bro that Oppenheimer score fading in hit me like crack
Way to go Cody
also... the home footage was so sweet.
Lmao I thought this was gonna be about him finding out he was gonna be a dad
holy hell. this was beautiful cody. you have been KILLING it
Nice
Truly inspirational Cody keep it up
I like how they had to distort beautiful day to play it 😂😂😂 lmbo
You’re telling me you came to Australia and I didn’t even get to attend a meet & greet, fml
Congratulations Cody, but you might get copyright from surfs up
Energy is everything
I love that you put the Oppenheimer music
Congrats Cody! What an accomplishment and inspiration for all of us looking to achieve our fitness goals. Proud of ya man
Cody we love you man! This was amazing. 🙌🏽

Still don’t know what the coin was for
Bro, the quality of production was mind blowing. So good. You deserve every bit of it man!
Crying real tears right now

This was actually so beautiful
Ironheimer man
W Cody for using oppenheimer music
Stop changing the title dude
NOT THE OPPENHEIMER MUSIC LOL But congrats Cody!
The cinematography of this video is crazy
''It's not in slowmo...it's in normal mo.''
Really shows Cody’s no games no carnivals mentality
Not me crying. This was so inspiring. Proud of you Cody!
The big take away from this video for me is that Cody sister is super hot.
I love this for Cody, but why is he interviewing himself on his own channel 😭
Shout out to Cody for not making some 4 part series lmao straight to the point 😂
I may or may not have cried watching that
I’m crying
i love seeing cody achieve things and it motivates me, and i love reading people’s comments about their achievements and it’s just such a great community feeling
Love the Oppenheimer music 😂
I cried my eyes out when Cody crossed the finish line up until the end of the video. Fuck. Beautifully made so happy that he documented his experience to share with the world.
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen
One of the most down to earth and humble social media personalities ive ever seen. This dood is fuggin awesome all the love and best of luck to you Cody Ko!
this video is so welll made, like a movie. But at the same time it still has a lot of codys humor which is so amazing
When that Oppenheimer music kicked in I got a little fired up ngl.
Insane!
Great documentary, and congrats on the effort!
I was never interested in Cody’s training or the Ironman and prefer his comedy and button vids but seeing his passion and dedication combined with his family’s love and support in this video had me enraptured the whole video and in tears by the end of it. Damn it U2.
This was giving surfs up vibes
this was so beautiful
We need Energy is Everything merchandise now!!
This was so beautiful wow. Congrats dude!!!
too me this is just in between the lines of inspiring cuz it is but its just funny because of the style of the video "Do you have a coin by chance?"
The music from oppenheimer went fucking INSANE on the training edit
I've watched this video a couple times now, cause I decided to show it to a few others. Was not expecting a literal Oscar worthy mini documentary bruh but you guys did that.
Bro used the Oppenheimer soundtrack to drop a fucking banger 💀
slay cody
Bro had to pop in the Oppenheimer music
"everyone else is lookin' at her like, "Hey, Cody's just a bum." "Cody's this," "Cody's that," "Cody's this." Cody's me, bro. Let me be me. When is that going to start?
Watched Oppenheimer for the first time today, and can say with confidence, THIS is the only masterpiece i've seen today.
this is so beautiful cody
Good Job Cody. Proud of you.
Inspirational.  Thank you
and now you get the honor of giving another human that same childhood wonder and unforgettable pride, congratulations cody
Got me crying and cheering when you crossed that finish line dude!!! Way to freaking go!!!! Congratulations to you and Kelsey on your future bundle of joy. So many great things happening for you. ❤
You’re the best
I cried watching this. Thank you for inspiring me to keep pushing everyday
Amazing. Forever will be my favourite youtuber.
The cross-cutting between young and current-day Cody is priceless. Props to the editor.
Incredible
smiles*  "its a cult"
I almost cried
Where funny
Such a meme the high quality production, love it
What a beautiful vid
I came to Cody for the goofs; I stay with Cody for the tears
I saw 10 x 300 swim and I cried a little as a former swimmer
I want to be as fit as your parents when I reach their age!!!
I want you to dj in detroit!!!
The Oppenheimer score went hard here
inspiring
The flashbacks of baby Cody on a bike is making me cry
For someone like me who has never even really enjoyed most forms of exercise, I really enjoyed this video and found myself moved and inspired by it. I’ve been watching Cody for years, and I genuinely feel like I’ve watched him grow into the best versions of himself and I am so proud of him for this, who he’s become, and I’m thankful as hell to live in a universe that Cody Ko was born, grew up, and found the courage to share his bubbly personality and lighting up the world with his humor and realness. Keep it up bro!
This was fucking beautiful man....shit.
hey my sister did this!!
I love this. So proud of how far you’ve come 😢❤
“We ascend together”
And you'll be there for your son in his iron man race!
Bro I saw this thumbnail and thought a parent died 😩
that was actually so well produced i felt like i was going to cry, wow congrats cody KO
dang it Cody... you did it again!
perfect video. the use of the song from oppenheimer ties everything together perfectly
Cody eating off the ground and Kelsey telling him not to😂😂😂😂
Energy is Everything!!
❤💪
This is awesome man. You’re an inspiration for young people like me in the way you live your life
Beautiful video. Wishing you and Kelsey all the best 🙏
Cody simply cannot let a women beat him
this is a beautiful piece of art
Missed opportunity to quote surfs up at 2:10
maybe use the word toughest day of your life? thought your parents died or something from the thumbnail man thats hard
i am so happy for you cody! you’re a true inspirational king
🥹
This video definitely deserves a comment. I am #inspired Energy Is Everything 😝
congrats. on everything you’ve been doing, so proud & so happy to see your life unfold in such beautiful ways ❤🎉
There are far too few choo choos… CHOO CHOO WE ASCEND TOGETHER
Wtf why am I tearing up at the end 😭 I really like seeing Cody's vulnerable side!
🥹🥹🥹🥹😭😭😭😭😭
This video made me tear up. It’s just so inspiring too see the work Cody put in to do the Ironman. Also the clips of his family and what it meant to everybody involved was just so special. It’s cool to see how far Cody has come.
The Oppenheimer soundtrack in the back is truly peak
Using ‘Fission’ from opppenhimer as a backing song for the race is awesome
Extremely motivating and touching video!  Congratulations Cody!!!!
This was amazing i almost cried. Congratulations Cody love you!!!❤️❤️
this is so cute
Why am I actually crying omg
cant believe cody just uploaded Surfs Up and didn’t think we’d notice 😔
It's cool how you can just be a goofy idiot all the time while making something serious and moving. Proud of you dude.
This was really touching Cody, the love from your family, the sacrifices to achieve your goal, all of it. Good job Ironman.
This was awesome.
this video made me tear up, one of the best videos ive seen in my life, congratulations Kody we are all proud of you <3
Such an beautiful story. You are going to be a fantastic husband and father.
Congrats Cody, it’s a huge achievement:)
Why am I crying
this is the coolest video on youtube :)
I liked the other title better
I didn’t think I’d get emotional watching this
What a video! Love this kind of video format, especially with the childhood videos.
Such a beautiful and inspiring video! Thank you so much for documenting this incredible achievement!
the oppenheimer soundtrack rlly fits this video wtf
Thoroughly enjoyed this banger Cody thank you
Am I the only one who was shouting 'stop your frikkin watch' at the screen when he stood there after crossing the line
What a good video
You couldn’t let her have one thing??? ☠️
this is emotional.. love you cody :’)
video is very well done. happy to see cody branching out and making some emotional shit. took the risk of being cringe and came out on top😂
Sobbing !! Love u
Proud of you, Cody! ❤️
Hey Cody I don’t usually watch ur videos but this one was great. Don’t look at the view count
Why am I tearing up rn? 🥹🥹
Aw ❤ I’ve watched you for years, I wasn’t sure what to expect clicking on this video but this warms my heart! Loved this and love seeing you accomplish amazing things❤❤❤
W Cody so many Ws
Nice usage of the Oppenheimer music, Chodester 👍🏼 proud of you!
Fuck yeah, Cody!
W Family ♨️
that was beautiful
Congradulations Cody!! What a feat!!  Keep striving for greatness
why tf am i sobbing about being so proud of a STRANGER???
the oppenheimer soundtrack in the background.. i started crying
so proud of you
He was an ironboy and finally became an ironman
I see this as an absolute win.
Cody is such a good guy. It’s good to see him winning👍
This was so beautifully made. Well done Cody!
This a masterpiece. A true inspiration, thank you @CodyKo🙏❤️
Holy shit i've never felt so proud of someone i have never met in person. Cody this is amazing, so proud of you. You are a wonderful husband, friend, son, soon to be dad, and IRONMAN. I LOVE YOU CHOOOO CHOOOOOOOOOOOOO CARDYYYYYYYYYYY
that's so fucking awesome, Cody!! I cried a lot...you are really inspiring ❤
I thought someone died
beautifully made video, teared up at the end. ITS A BEAUTIFUL DAY!
Epic Oppenheimer music
Oppenheimer Soundtrack went crazy
go back to being funny i don’t have any tears left
WTF CODY ILY!!! 😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰🤟🤟🤟
I’m so proud of Cody. I didn’t think this video would bring me tears. Life is actually tough sometimes and this is just a great reminder to keep pushing through. No matter how big something may seem it’s attainable with a certain attitude. Cody’s videos have comforted me the last 3 and a half years. They’ve reminded me to keep a smile on my face because there’s always something to be joyful of. This one definitely tops what had seemed untoppable. (That’s a new word thank you.) I’m actually so proud of him and I hope his viewers are just as inspired as I am. This is a great community of people and I’m sure the ones that are invested in him as I am take this to become better versions of themselves. That’s clearly what he tries to do with his personality and his videos and I’m glad I’ve found it here on YouTube. Keep up the great work Cody, and anyone who reads this. ✊
What did I just watch? My respect for Cody just 10x’d. What a cool dude.
This makes me want to get my ass to the gym. LETS GO!          But first…let me finish this raw cookie dough real quick….
This gets me incredibly motivated. Huge congratulations Cody
Energy is everything and “Can you hear the music” from Oppenheimer really went well together
Congrats cody for all of your accomplishments. Love u💖
I’m bout to run a marathon w/o training. Thoughts?
Okay but why did this make me cry
squirrel in the bakground at 7:00
nice Oppenheimer music
Moneyball, The Social Network, and Oppenheimer all in one video. Christopher Nolan? Who even is that?
“Can You Hear The Music” at the end got me going, felt like I was in the IronMan as well
Thank you for making this video Cody. This was incredibly inspiring. And congratulations on all your recent success. You deserve it, my man! Keep it up ❤️
wow imagine how hard this would be if you had a real job!
Oppenheimer music going crazy
why did changing the title and thumbnail actually make me click, what an algorithm nerd
Why did I just cry 🥹🥹
Wow... what a video!! Congratulations brother! 🤙
Damn... congratulations ❤
suprised that cody was watching old clips on a projector rather than a garmin.
Dude i thought someone died lol plz
Absolute work of art. So inspiring, Cody!!
Bro used the Oppenheimer background sound effects
proof that the oppenheimer score makes everything 1000x better. awesome video!
congrats Cody, ur an iron man with a heart of gold ❤
This makes me want to try.  I haven't in a long time, and I've just been waiting for it to end.  It's been really terrible.  I'd forgotten about the strength in each of us, and this video was a testament to that.  I have to rise up again.  Thanks Cody!😊🎉
I'm so jealous. Your life is so good. You earn enough to fulfill your goals, you have a nice family, awesome parents and probably happy childhood. This is fantastic, I'm glad for you
loved the oppenheimer soundtrack
Aw dude I’m crying 😭😭 this was an amazing video
Damn it Cody, got me out here crying. This entire journey has been super inspiring, and heartwarming. The support that you have around you is just so beautiful! Thanks for the motivation, bro lol.
His dad's Canadian accent
K, fine. I'll get my shit together. Thank you.
This is amazing Cody, you have accomplished so much in this last year! Congrats man 🥳
I could cry!! So proud of you, Cody!!
I’m so proud of you dad and thanks for supporting dad, mom 😂
I love how far this meme has gone😂😂😂. Cody is becoming a petty QUEEN!! We love to see it.   Congrats on your 4, 1/4 Ironmans complete Cody!   And extra congrats on becoming a daddy!
Was expecting the usual shitpost content, positively surprised to find out it was mini doc :) Gz Cody, wish my family did exercise like this together.
Damn this was beautiful, I almost cried
This reminds of surfs up
this man really used two of the best soundtracks in movie history and I'm crying rn
Cody’s entire training arc was inspiring to watch, every day I tuned in. I’m not able to train and work the same way he is but his determination and constant uploads inspired me to train for my own competition. It was a beginner comp but very proud to have landed 2nd place in my first ever competition
This had me laughing and crying at the same time, loved it!
cody needs an emmy for this one lmao i know its satire on these kind of documentaries but he did it so well ???
Never thought a Cody Ko video would bring me to happy tears 🥹🤍
Why am I crying
man the oppenheimer ost in the end of the video gives such an insane vibe… ENERGY IS EVERYTHING
I vid was super different from your normal content and i hella enjoyed it 😂
Cody's arc from the fun fuckboy frat act he put on to now a inspirational icon, father and husband. Truly a masterpiece.
Damn man you shoulda done cold ones right before the race
So happy and excited for this project. I love seeing you do different things Cody
Amazing Cody.
OPPENHEIMER MUSIC
Congrats dude, amazing story 👍
The Oppenheimer theme hits 🤌🤌
Amazing video, amazing story, amazing production. 10/10 content just increased to 13/10. keep it up king
damn you got me with the title change lol. ctr wasn't doing well? (I'm just messing, very proud of you! and the filmmaking for this is great!!)
I’m gonna go on my first run in a month tonight!! You go Cody!!!!!
I wish I could like this 1000000 times
Very cool video
couldn't decide on a title eh
amazing
cant believe Cody could be so inspirational and cinematic at the same time but here we are… congrats Cody, it’s an incredible feat you’ve accomplished 🫡
What an inspirational video. It got me emotional 🥲
This video was absolutely amazing, I know absolutely nothing about Iron man but this is video was so entertaining and interesting and seeing the documentary style was such a welcomed change. So proud of all you've accomplished
I did my first half iron man a couple months ago and want to eventually do a full because of you!
when the oppenheimer “can you hear the music” kicked in… beautiful.
this was so good
i actually teared up, amazing!!
Nah bro Cody fell off. This lame af, he started running and he left the funny behind.
ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS! 💯
You’re amazing! Thanks for inspiring me and so many people in multiple aspects of life!
I love this mini doc. It makes me feel like I could use some ice cream 😋😅🤣
I saw the thumbnail and thought his parents died or something
Beautiful. Congratulations on finishing  and becoming an iron man! And congratulations on the baby
This video was so unbelievably touching. All of us are so proud of you Cody, and although it really doesn’t seem personal, we’re all so happy for you. Whether it be this, your wedding, or your recent prosperous achievements, we’re so happy for you. This video was both inspiring and heartwarming, thank you, and once again congratulations.
what sort of netflix edit is this ????
i feel incredible inspiration from Cody but also when i saw the video, i thought he was going to delve into some trauma and its the iron man 💀 i haven't finished the video so maybe he does lol but its crazy how ahead you get in life when you dont grow up in poverty, with mental illness and substance abuse.
10/10
This was amazing
i cried
you should make "energy is everything" hats. I would buy one.
Ironfam
in numerology, your number 413 reduces to 8 which is the strength card :) energy is EVERYTHING! good job Cody <3
I’m crying?
Quality content man.
Bro this is tight. I’m not a runner and you inspired me to train for and run a half marathon something i thought i had no interest in ever doing. Also very impressive short documentary!! It’s hard to create a story arch and emotion in 13 minutes and you had me tearing up, sooo dope!!
what im so confused about is how does he look that good at the end of the race? Like at 11:52 he doesnt even have pit stains. Its so unfair cuz if i run a mile a look like post malone took a bath in acid. But good for you i guess
Love you Cody! I’ve been watching you for over 5 years and it makes me so happy to see you grow as a person. I hope you see this comment Cody. Such a good role model
Brother why am I crying in an airport rn
tiny cody is so cute 😭
congrats cody!!
a true family man
love u cody
Love this and that you used the Oppenheimer music 😂
the oppenheimer music 🔥🔥
Great video cody! Holy shit the production value is insane! WE ASCEND TOGETHER!❤
Having “Can You Hear the Music” from Oppenheimer playing in the background really elevated this video
congratulations!!
I’m not training for an IronMan but I want to let you know that you and Cody Trains has given me the energy to consistently work towards my goals! If I don’t feel like working out or jogging, I watch your content and I feel like I can do it! Thank you for showing this! We ascend together!!!
Can't imagine what kind of stuff I could see and do if I didn't have to worry about eating and putting gas in the car. "Same thing you're doing now. Nothing." "Jealous cause you're unlovable." "Pray and you can be an ironman." And all the other snide comments...
Thanks, now im crying.
Love that passion that Cody has in everything he’s doing. Such an inspirational story. Congrats to Cody for the achieved Ironman milestone! 🫵💪
Proud of you Cody
i would love to see more documentary style like this from cody
this was so great! i can only imagine how proud everyone in your family is of you. what a wonderful thing you get to share with the people you love! congratulations man!
That was simply the most encouraging, uplifting, hearwarming video I have watched in a while. Your family is simply beautiful and it makes sense how you became the person you are today, you are persistent and that's very (extremely) difficult, it makes me respect you even more. Kudos!
I think it’s not fair for you to be making me cry like this. I don’t know you personally and I’m so proud of you.
The Oppenheimer soundtrack was very fitting
not me crying fr
Why are my eyes wet?
who would have thought that a comedy youtuber would become my biggest inspiration one day
First time I’ve ever cried over a Cody Ko video
The social network music, i'm dead
Didn’t think this was gonna make me cry🥹
Can you hear the music BANGS
I love the Oppenheimer music
codyyyyyy, we love you. we're proud of you. i can't believe you're gonna be a dad soon. your kid(s?) are gonna be so inspired by you and Kelsey : ' )
You did NOT use the most emotional music from Everything Everywhere All At Once, for a 30 second clip of you talking about a hat
MY BOYD AN IRONMAN
this made me cry. so proud of you dude
Congratz on your achievement. And awesome to see you do it with your parents. Also that Oppenheimer music! 😙
Okay Oppenheimer music!!! (Proud of you!!)
This was amazing Cody!!!!
Cody making me cry
Why did I cry
Sick documentary 👌
I loved the part about energy is everything, at first Cody said I don't know what that means and eventually he finds out throughout this experience. It was beautiful
this made me want do iron man (im sedentary)
❤
This was so awesome!!! So well produced too :)
It's really refreshing to see this vulnerable side of Cody. I had started a weight loss journey and have fallen off track. It's nice to have something to relate to in the sense that very few, if any, people can do a strict exercise regimen with 100% success and I need to be more forgiving to myself. Congrats Cody!!
Damn, Codys morning routine is INSANE
Oppenheimer soundtrack lol Man nuked Ironman
This was dope as fuck, funny man. Congrats!
cody: i didnt really know anything about swimming also cody: *was captain of the varsity swimming and diving team at duke*
i’m crying so hard
It’s cool all of the home videos
literally brought tears to my eyes
Oppenheimer music is just so damn good
Congratulations! So sick! 🎉🎉🎉
I cried
Im pregnant and emotional but damn this was so well done. Im cryinggggggg. Great job, Cody!
this was beautiful!! congratulations! so proud of you Cody!! Super proud of your parents too!
I love how Cody’s family managed to shorten one of the worlds shortest names to Code
crying, proud of you Cody!
This was beautiful and so inspiring well done Cody! But honestly the "what about your little boy 👿" took me out 😂😂😂
This is awesome. Congratulations!
Cody is such an interesting guy to me bc he seems so unserious and funny and joking around but then he’s like the most determined dude he’s and works his ass off it’s so insane
Ironfam
Beautiful, cody! Just beautiful! You made so many people proud. You've inspired so many people. Must be a weird feeling to be so loved by so many. Good job. You're leaving a legacy  !
Swimming in the ocean at 5am? I’d have a heart attack. I’m terrified of sharks.
congrats cody !!!
So inspiring! Congratulations for completing this amazing goal
Never in my life did I think a Cody Ko video would make me cry— laugh? Undoubtedly. But Cry? This is new
Fuck. Why am I crying lmao
💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼energy is everything
What a beautiful video!
Loved the Oppenheimer music
Man used Oppenheimer them song🤣
Wow. This man trained for and completed an Iron Man just to promote his merch.  Truly inspiring 🥲
It’s a cult😀
buddy using the same music as Oppenheimer in his video?
ENERGY IS EVERYTHING
I never leave comments but the ending had me sobbing😭 this was so beautiful and inspiring
This is amazing !!! Great work !
so happy to have been a part of this journey and to see you achieve this goal! truly inspiring cody!
This has be in tears! What an inspiration cody! Thanks for being you
Still waiting for the part when he talks bout Robbert downie jr
loveee itt wholesome video 💛 congrats!👏🥳
Gets to the race day part and my lunch break ends :///
What it's like to have a loving family!
IRON MAN CHATTANOOGA!! I’ve lived here my entire life I even lifeguarded the first one 10 years ish ago
Energy is everything... Frictionless, if you will.
need energy is everything merch
so inspiring! also now i want one of those massage guns
Came here because I saw Brittany crying over this on her story 😭
damn this made me want to be an ironman
Did you beat your sisters time?
You must have been crushed when Tony Stark died
Damn! so cool!
KERDY 😭💀
Can you hear the music. Great choice 🙏
Cody doing a full on triathlon halfway across the world over sibling rivalry is incredible haha
energy is everything
dude this is awesome❤️
2:13 Everyone's like Cody this, Cody that. Cody's me bro, let me be
Almost teared up. The chodebro has come so far
amazing
What a STUPID video, im tearing up by his dad encouraging him as kid on the bike with the motivational music. Then 2 shots later cody stands in front of a bunch of popcorn?? Its dumb i LOVE IT.  Congrats man 🔥
my parents dont have any video footage of me as a baby or a kid and im only 26. hurts cos it feels like they don't care about me.
The look on Cody's face every time Kelsey told him to be careful was so dad coded.
A 1h version of this would be great
Cody wtf i’m crying. As a distance runner i can really relate (not as much to iron man training however), and the last part got me good
Absolute beauty of a video!
Beautiful video! Keep challenging yourself and trying new things.
The use of the soundtrack from oppenheimer was really fitting
when you misspell your own last name
U had to put the score from Everything Everywhere didnt u 😢😢
thecodytrains series inspired me to train for my first marathon, I literally adore Cody so much bc I practically grew up watching him 🤩
16 of his best friends? How many best friends does this dude have??
Bro why would you drink coke while on the most difficult run of your life 😂😂😂
this video was perfect it was so good to watch almost a movie swear to god
You are so inspiring!! Thank you for sharing your journey with us, we love and admire you so much
Great mini documentary. aww congratulations cody, well done on completing another dream.
This is beautiful. Congrats dude!!
I'm crying
this was so wonderful
What a good video
Oppenheimer music?
self indulgent af
Normal-mo 😂😂😂
Genuinely teared up watching this, after watching Cody trains for the past few months up to this is huge, legendary Cody.
This is amazing ❤
Also congratulations iron ko!!!
This is such a well done documentary 👏
never met this man or his family, I know multiple Ironmans irl, but this hits home like nothing before! im just so proud. hell yea. maybe its because of the Cody trains account, idk. but I'm so proud of you Cody, energy is everything!
Cody out here making epic documentaries for us now🔥
Is this meant to be a parody? Are you trolling? It VERY much comes off as a parody.
This. This is what it’s all about. Thank you for sharing with us, Cody.
Guar cardy!!!!
im sobbing???
Freaking made me tear up gaywad  Congrats though video is very aspiring an give me motivation… to do my first marathon
This is a beautiful video
Omg this video was so amazing. Congrats Cody!!! I've loved watching you train this past year. ENERGY IS EVERYTHING
that lil wink on the bike? nice
crying at the idea of your son watching this in the future like that's my dad
What was this not 2 hours long :(
Bro used Oppenheimer music
watching this prior to every workout now !!!  energy is everything !!!
I am so glad you made this doc. I had no idea what it was like - more intense than I imagined. Congrats :)
The home videos got me emotional
Absolutely loved this
not me getting emotional too, go Cody 🥹🥳
This is beautiful!!!! 😭🥰
most inspirational shit i’ve ever seen
“It’s in normal mo”
The first Cody ko video that made me… cry??? I’m so proud of you 🥹
this was so good i could cry so proud❤
This was really fucking cool
This was really cool and inspiring but I’m sorry what in the world was that cinematic shot of you sitting with popcorn flying behind you on a projector…
the sloppenheimer music lol
I had no clue he got injured. I was training for a triathlon earlier this summer and was seeing all the benefits and then I broke my arm. I’ll be (hopefully) cleared tomorrow morning, and it’s inspiring to see someone claw back their lost progress.
Cody is by far one of my most fav YouTubers. Trying different things and always pushing the limits of himself and his contents in the best way. Much love dawg
Choo Choo
wow.
this video was amazing, slay
This is the realest take I’ve ever heard 😂
Why the fuck was this so good and uplifting and positive?? Cody finna be the reason I get in shape.
Let’s go
It's not often a youtube video brings me to tears. Congratulations Cody. CHOO-CHOO
This was awesome to watch ‼️
This is so inspirational. I wish this video was longer!!!! The choo choo at the end🥹🥹
This brought tears to my eyes. Favorite Cody Ko video ever! Gave me chills when he mentioned the part about how the U2 song came on at the finish line. Absolutely beautiful
This video gave me massive a ''Surfs Up''  vibe at the start.  Love that movie and enjoyed this video very much.
Why am I crying 🥹 Proud of you Cody 🫶🏽
At the end when he's talking about his parents and "setting the example for someone else"- I think he's talking about his son since he had probably just found out he was going to be a dad :')
I’m so proud of Cody, he was great to start with but he’s come such a long way and it’s really inspirational
That oppenheimer sound track was perfect for this
This video was a piece of art, really motivated me to do better.
This was so great! After watching you every week on Cody trains and your recaps on the podcast I knew the whole story but I love watching the calls back to your childhood and the very emotional parts to your journey. Well done! Gor Cody! Choo choo!
Banger of a video. Your personality really suits this content
This was such a great video. I *almost* want to do an Ironman, but I don't want to suffer for that long lol. Love the choo choo at the end
Incredible congrats dude, so inspiring ❤️
Unreal dedication, Cody!!! This speaks a lot about your character. Way to rise to the challenge and occasion!!!
Wow! This just inspired me to start training for an event like that! (Me eating Doritos in my bed with a recently reconstructed ACL, so much that I can barely run for 20 minutes)
tears running down my face right now…such a beautiful story 😭😭😭
That was truly beautiful
Congratulations! What a tremendous achievement!
wow this was incredible
That was awesome! Congrats funny guy!
Every once and awhile YouTube gets a video so beautifully made I can call it art. This is one of the most motivational videos i've ever seen. I feel like I just watched an amazing movie in 14 minutes.   Congratulations Cody!
I wanna do this. I really do...
way too gooooooo kooooooooo
Dude yes this was so inspiring
So dope brother
So inspiring!
I do an Ironman every morning 🚽💨💨😱💩 yeah I’m really old!
this was the most incredible 13 minutes- like award winning👏🏾👏🏾 congrats on becoming an iron man and kudos to the team behind this!!!
This made me so emotional. Achieving something so personal to you is so amazing! Congratulations
This made me feel like I could do it but in reality I’m winded after a flight of stairs and need my inhaler. You are amazing!
I’m so proud of you! I can only imagine a tiny fraction of the pride, your parents and your wife and your sister must feel for you! I feel as though I’m another proud mother of yours watching her son succeed lol. I am 40 I’m not that old but still I feel so proud as if I could be your mother lol. You are so inspiring you set your heart to some thing and you do it with your fullest intent whether it’s YouTube, DJing, training for Iron Man, you do it with every fiber of your being, and that intent trickles into the minds and hearts of everyone who sees it. Thank you for this congratulations my friend. I love you so much!❤
beautiful
Good shit Cody
this is way too cinematic bruh
This was soooo touching😢
This is beautiful and so inspiring. i love this
so proud of you cody, you did amazing! ♥️♥️
Lol, love the Oppenheimer and Social Network soundtrack songs, top tier
that was pretty cool man.
This is awesome, but I thought the Ultra Marathon video was better for showing how hard it is. In that video Cody showed some of his worst moments including footage of him barely completing the marathon. It feels like that may have not been or maybe it was the fact it was more high production. Idk but since it’s such a long term thing those down moments are helpful to see
This video is everything. I’m so proud of you and who you are Cody
So so amazing! I loved watching Cody trains but this is so beautifully done
took me a second to recognize the music. oppenheimer. good choice.   and congrats Cody! that’s no easy task and one i can certainly not do. mainly because i can’t swim.
feels so good seeing this eyes moist 🥹
Thank you, can’t wait to see one of these made by your kid in the future
videos like this should have 100M views, not some stupid hotel comparison
So crazy that his parents did it with him as well. Two people probably around their fifties. Thats insane, congrats to everyone fr
beautiful video
Damn your dad is really fucking Canadian
the interstellar music
The Oppenheimer track goes hard
omg and now he's gonna be a dad, this is so cute 😭
This was beautifully shot and edited
This was very cool to watch thank you for sharing  and congratulations !!
Cordy Kolodzez..jerk you are an Ironman
this is so inspiring, congratulations cody
SO PROUD 🥹🎉👏🏻
This is great
so sick
Kudos to Cody for riding on the trainer. It’s an amazing training tool but oh so boring. Good for you. Good for him for putting in the hours and not giving up after the injury
Would love to see more content like this. Wild!
Who is cutting onions 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Literally crying (and yes, I used that word correctly)   Love you, man :)
We want more videos like this! Production is frictionless! Proud of you Cody
The Jay Jay Johanson song in the back got me emotionnal
Cody, this is amazing! The cinematography, production, to the narrative. I was laughing and enjoying this masterpiece the whole way through. Congrats on becoming an ironman! #energyiseverything
YEESSSSSSSS
Man.. This made me cry like a damn baby What a beautiful story of hard work and perseverance
i don't think i could do this, go cody
i would love to see cody's birth chart. the connection between family life and exercise definitely gives 4H-6H connections. this is such an accomplishment and clearly a major part of his life so im sure its reflected in the chart :')
Thank you for not making this 2 hrs
Of course Cody was looking forward to the coke at the 8th station 😳
Really really happy for you such a great video !!!!
This was one of the most motivating minidocumentaries to me and he hardly even tried
7:00 squrrial
Had the biggest smile on my face the whole time I was watching this
Nobody talking about how he used the Oppenheimer Theme Song ?
Great video 🙂
13:02 Cody I am crying this was beautiful and I am so thankful that you shared this journey with us all
my girlfriend is crying....."It's so emotional!..."
this made me extremely emo and I wasnt expecting it. proud of u cody and the man u are wish u nothing but the best for your baby!
I wonder if his sister was privileged enough to train like him too. Or did she have to work even harder because she couldn't afford things like the home bike or being able to wake up at 5am during the week to swim  instead of having to go to work. Imagine how much better than him his sister really is. Hmmmm  Dope video tho🤙 I'm pretty athletic myself and this video honestly kinda made me wanna train for the ironman once I have money/time to do it
Congrats, man.
Congratulations Cody
This is amazing! So wonderful to see
Energy Is Everything
Goodjob buddy
11:15 it’s so sad how he can joke about his addiction, i’m hoping you did the ironman not coked out and please get help cody❤
the oppenheimer music fits so well, i can hear the music cody
Damn you’re an avenger and a dad
Why is this giving me surfs up energy “Cody’s this Cody’s that codys me bro let me be me”
Congrats! Very inspiring!
So sick
Oppenheimer??????? 11:00
this was amazing
Inspired to do the same
I cried
Cody Ko is just like the most wholesome guy to have ever lived. This video just made me love him even more. He deserves the world!
Hell ya dude... Been wanting to do a full ironman for years. This is def some good motivation
Hey man it’s been a while. Love your journey been following you since COVID
I had the idea of doing an ironman years ago, I remember writing it down in my journal. And the idea came again this year. I followed along your Ironman journey, and you inspired me so much. I started the road to 10km for the next 7 weeks... not quite an Ironman, but it's a start. I'm deeply terrified of biking too, but it's gonna happen soon, maybe just a trek bike for now, those skinny tire ones are freaky... Thanks Cody, your energy is everything :)
train noel with his lanky ass
CHOO CHOO
Congratulations Cody
Your not suppose to make me fucking cry wtf
not this video making me sob or whatever
this was a masterpiece of a video
the way they used the oppenheimer music, amazing
wishing i could like this twice..
Why was that video touching? For what reason? ;-;
Wow!! Congrats man!
Is that the Oppenheimer soundtrack?? 😂 but seriously Cody you’ve inspired me greatly with this video. I’ve always sucked at swimming and I’ve never really biked much. I’m training right now for my first half marathon, ran 6 miles the other day at a 7:56 pace and I’m feeling good but this vid really makes me wanna go above and beyond and do an iron man. I hope you genuinely know how inspiring this is, it’s making me emotional. And it’s kind of frustrating that I wanna do an iron man now cause damn that’s a lot of work 😂
Choo choo 🚂 so proud! Doing a half marathon next year because of how you’ve inspired me 🥺
i’m speechless this video is perfection
Watching Cody trains was life changing. I truly mean it
❤❤❤
Best video on your channel by far 🐐
what a sick vid dj boy
This might be the cheesiest video ever uploaded to youtube and i love it so much😂
100% on this so fucking rad
Very nice video and I am so jealous you did it !  I had to pull out from Ironman Copenhagen 2 weeks ago and the race is this weekend .... still heartbroken as all the training was done 🥺
the fact your mum and dad also did it is kinda burying the lede there boss
this was so incredibly well made, it made me cry seeing Cody cross the finish line and all the sweet and caring things Kelsey would say
Damn bro did two half ironmans 🔥🔥
Cody talking about his dad supporting him through this and him wanting to be that person for someone in the future knowing he and Kels have a baby boy on the way!!! Cody has inspired all of us already, but he’s going to have that opportunity to do what his dad did for him :)
Attaboy
This was a beautiful video on your journey to becoming an Ironman. Now you & Kelsey have little mister on the way you will share this with, & maybe continue your family tradition. It's all so beautiful and made me tear up. Thanks for everything!
This video is amazing!! @codyko is inspiring
and you've got a baby boy to bring this tradition too! i loved seeing this side of you ☺
dang, this was awesome and wholesome!
Yeah I wanna do one of these now.
is that tony stark?
So inspiring!! Good job Cody
Did my first half marathon in april and loved training, had a major setback by blowing out my knee and it's really been messing with mentally, but seeing this video has really motivated me to do everything I can to get back on track and not let this setback hold me down. Inspiring man, thank you!
Oppenheimer theme jumpscare
It's nice to see what Cody can accomplish in his old age!
Dude, Cody. What the fuck man. You, your family, your team... What a phenomenal piece on your journey. With all the parallels from your childhood. In absolute tears watching this. Inspiring as hell!
We are all so proud of you!
Cody I’m crying!! Not only is this a BEAUTIFUL video in every way but a BEAUTIFUL story!! Super proud of you buddy!! ❤️❤️
What a beautiful video 🥲
Cody this made me cry!! You normally make me laugh lol! Congratulations, this was clearly such a meaningful and rewarding experience. Way to go Ironman!
the parallel with his younger self crossing the finish line 🥹🥹
such a beautiful video, you are an inspiration and role model to so many, including myself. i hope to reach your level of success in my future. congratulations man you deserve it all
Oppenheimer theme came on I went crazy
Inspiring ✨🤍🫶🏽
so cool
What a fantastic fucking video!!! I'm all over the place here! I laughed.. I cried! I played football for a year on a peewee team as a kid solely cos my brothers said I wouldn't so I totally get the sibling rivalry aspect!
It’s easy, I see a Cody Ko video, I watch a Cody Ko video
Editing 4:21 top notch
HELL YEAH
i love the change cody has had. Yet he has become the thing he made fun of
This was so great! I got so emotional at the end! Such a huge fan Cody! Thanks for sharing your experience with us! <3
Sobbing rn
This is so heartwarming & inspiring!!! CONGRATULATIONS CODY!!
That’s Cringe: Ironman DJ Conductor
Did Cody Ko get the soundtrack from the Hacker movie?
Wow this is beautiful!
The Oppenheimer music hits DIFFERENT
when i say this video made me bawl.. im not exaggerating, i watched it on my lunch break at work and i had to come in and close my office door. we are SO proud of you cody, and proud of kelsey for helping you through it, CHOO CHOO♥️♥️♥️
the use of can you hear the music from oppenhiemer okayyyy
This Ironman is having an ironbaby. Love that.
Did Cody just drop an ESPN worthy video?!?!?!
Ilysm man, Im so proud of you
Absolutely love how full circle your whole Ironman journey was. Serendipitous to say the least!
Congratulations man ❤
I’m not crying you’re crying
Am I sobbing?… perhaps
LOVEEEE

So inspiring!

We ascend together! Choo choo 🚂👊🏼
This is absolutely beautiful and so well produced. Congrats on your achievement
So happy for you!
Can’t believe Cody is comparing himself to the man who beat thanos
The Oppenheimer music is awesome
Anyone else think Cody sounds like Tom Cruise?
This was just a beautiful video. Love this type of content
Watching this was so cool. My dad has done 13 Ironmans and I’ve been to so many but I’ve also watched you for 10 years as well. It’s been so cool to see these two worlds combine. Congrats!!!
Huge W bro ❤
Moneyball, Social Network, Oppenheimer soundtracks are insane
I cried while watching Kelsey’s vlog of your Ironman and I cried watching this! It’s crazy how proud I can feel of someone I’ve never met. Congrats Cody!!!!!
remember guys! don’t eat off the floor
the ending + the recent baby announcement made me BAWL. you'll do great cody, im not even worried about it
Art.
i didn't expect for this to get me so emotional. I'm so thankful for the day i watched a video of cody for the first time he helped me get through really hard times and I'm so proud of everything he's achieving in life
Cody, congrats my dude! ❤ This was amazing and inspiring! All your hard work paid off!
OKAY OPPENHEIMER SOUDTRACK
WHAT IS THAT SECOND SONG
beautiful video cody! congratulations!
Congratulations mate, truly an inspiration
I mean, WHAT A PRODUCTION. seriously, speechless. So deserving Cody. Good for you💪🏼
Bruh there’s no way you were swimming with speed sockets
As said by one of the greatest runners alive, “No human is limited.” You further prove that Cody, thank you for inspiring me and literal millions of other people. ❤
played this while making breakfast and suddenly I’m catching myself watching this on my phone w tears on my face :,) proud of u Cody!!!
GOOSEBUMPS!!!!! This was great
I loved how raw this was. This just feels so motivating. No sugarcoating. Just showing the challenges of committing to something like this is and how rewarding it can be after.
Cody I have been watching you consistently since the Vine days. You are looking so healthy and youthful! You look great!! Congrats!!!!!
Congratulations man. I can’t tell when you joke or when you’re being serious the hat killed me
“Cardy Kolozee..jek” had me CRYING I’m so glad you put that in. Congratulations on all of the amazing milestones in your life this past year, thanks for sharing your life with us king!!!
Crying at breakfast
Bro why did I cry so hard
never thought i’d cry bc of a cody ko video.
I don’t think I’ve ever commented on a YouTube video before, but had to say how much I loved this. This is a huge accomplishment and what a great way to document this memory. ENERGY IS EVERYTHING haha
Awesome! Congrats, making me feel like I can do an Iron Man.
This video literally just inspired me to sign up for my first 5K in 15 years. Troegs Hop Dash, Hershey PA, 9/30...see you there lol
Anyone know where the song at 5:41 is from?   Your inspiring Cody, keep doing your thing 🤙
Who knew Cody the comedian was gonna make us cry 😩 but for real, Cody, you’re such a talented individual and this proves that you can achieve anything you put your mind to 🥳
What a masterpiece
Cody, your training videos truly inspire me to put my best foot forward and to keep training. It has been so refreshing how authentic you have been and helps me realize that it’s okay to not have it all figured out at the beginning. It’s a journey. I appreciate your content and am excited to see what you do next. Choo choo.
Great work Cody! Such an inspirational journey and story!
Loved the video. Great. What was the popcorn shot?
I shed a tear at the end🥹
This was truly inspiring.
"I can't have my little sister do something I can't do" So relatable.
SOBBINGGG proud of ya!
Cody Ko Yes Theory collab, please and thank you.
The day Cody became Energy
"I hope to be that to someone in the future" ALRIGHT DAD, congrats on the baby news <3
ENERGY IS EVERYTHING CHOO CHOO
ignoring how some friend of his probably just left it, and he just didn't think to ask around if anyone was missing a hat. I gotta admit, there's something poetic with that small part on the hat. basically being given a message to "remember energies", and the message having no apparent sender
I can't be the only one who read "1945 Tokyo" on the thumbnail... right?
Sometimes I run out of breath walking up the stairs
<3 goat
Cody, brother, I've been following you for the past five years, and I just wanted to say thank you for being such an inspiration. Since watching your training vlog I was inspired to sign up for my first marathon in October, and I'm in the best shape of my life. I would have never done it were it not for me seeing your journey. Thanks for being such a champ in life and for making others champs in your wake.
Beautiful and inspiring story. Respect! Energy is everything
Love the oppenheimer music !!!
Cody ko 30 for 30
DUDE! This video was so good! Congratulations big man, like seriously, congratulations!
LEGENDARY OUTRO
Why am I crying 😭😂
This was so good!! Congrats to you Cody!
11:43 this is when i got chills
10:31 I love this sign cuz u want to support everyone for working so hard even if you dont know them
I love seeing cody serious
Genuinely one of the best YT videos I've ever watched, thank you Cody (& prod. team) and congrats!
Amazing video wow
“Because my little sister did one”  The most older brother thing
this makes me wanna get my ass up and do something meaningful. love those videos.
im crying
Someone said Cody's dad was there for his 1st Ironman and Cody's son was there for his dads 1st Ironman and now i see this experience as even more beautiful. Im so proud of you Cody. So incredibly proud🥲
11:18 we all thought it
this is why I love Cody, his cut videos keep me going, but then, every once in a while, he’ll give us something really serious and personal like this that’s really meaningful. Keep doing your thing!!!
All of the chauvinistic stuff (idc how much of it was joking) ab his little sister 😭 great video tho
That Oppenheimer score 🔥🔥🔥
Cody, I'm glad you made it. It's a great achievement. But in the most loving way possible, you're a dumbass lol. Keep it up! Energy is E V E R Y T H I N G!
what an inspiration ❤️🐐
The use of “can you hear the music” gave me chills. Great video
I'm crying this was so beautiful
dude im a little bitch why u gotta make me cry! all the love and respect to u!
Was that ‘can you hear the music?’ from Oppenheimer? Incredible song!
He was an Ironman… until he wasn’t..
Man, I want to do an iron man now.
Oppenheimer soundtrack was 100% appropriate.
it’s funny 0:22 calls Cody the “iron Everyman” cause I’ve always thought Cody’s appeal as a YouTuber is being the everyman that pretty much everyone can relate to in some way
Truly inspiring. For an 86 year old man to make accomplishments like this….. I’m just at a loss for words right now.
dude its not that impressive. no need for an entire channel and video. i could do it too if i would be good at swimming, biking and running, which im not. but if i was it would be easy. i mean i can run like one kilometer in 3 minutes, so its just basic math that i would be faster than cody.
This videos dope as fuck but also a little cringe
This was beautiful ❤
Wow so cinematic!
shitt now i want to workout
Was that the Oppenheimer theme? Gave me absolute chills
Love you Cody!!! You’re the besttttt
Im crying, this was such a beautiful example of everything you do as a parent really matters 💚 so happy for you Cody!!! You deserved every single bit of that fulfillment and happiness when you finished the race!!!
This is such a beautiful story! Congratulations!!!
Damn..now u make me wanna do an ironman
ENERGY IS EVERYTHING!
the Oppenheimer music, we love to see it
Cody, you inspire me so much. Your dedication to everything that you do and how you’ve experienced SO MUCH already in such a short amount of time makes me want to be the best version of myself. You’re killing it dude. Energy is everything.
this is sick af
Codyheimer
Great video. Love seeing u make thigns ur passionate ab.
This is so awesome. Super inspiring. Makes me feel like I could do it too! I won’t. But I feel like I could! 😂 good work bro 👍🏼
Random question: Did he fly with his bike or rent one there?
this was so beautiful to watch and witness your journey
So beautiful. Seeing you cross that line actually made me cry. Inspirational 💪🏼
I cant believe Cody would have rode past my house and I didnt even know!!!!
Why’d I cry
this video is the perfect mix of humor and heartfelt. watching cody trains has been so motivating. can't wait to see what the future holds, way to go!
Literally the coolest guy I know, never seen a more true to himself guy, so inspiring
this man is so unserious
Damn why’d this make me cry. I love you and Kels so much. So proud of you!!
I love the Social Network soundtrack. Great choice lol
this was such a good video wow
I love all that you do cody thanks!
lmaooooo the intro killed me
I wouldn't put it beyond Kelsey to have planted that stupid "Energy is Everything" hat for Cody to find.
Why am I crying
I'll take a feature length cut please
Really happy for you! This video is remarkable! Thanks for the inspiration ❤
Congrat Cody! You’re making me want to go back to the treadmill again 😭
Didn't know this was such a personal thing to Cody, truly truly inspiring. I admire you very much!! Congratulations, you deserve every bit of it 🙏
I wanna do an ironman one day
Are we all crying ?? Or just me?
Fucking emosh 😭
Energy Is Everything
so beautifully done
Okay damn. I didn't think I was going to like this video, but I'm so inspired now. I love it!
Incredible Cody, you inspire me everyday! The music was so good in this
RuneScape players be like
Crying over a Cody Ko video? This is a new feeling
Ok I’m so not crying 😭
anyone know the music at 12:28?
Pmg the ENDING CODY 😭😭😭😭 that’s so sweet
i am not crying...you are
This really inspired me
When are you joining Russ in Africa???!?
Energy is everything.
Cody has one strong athletic family! Its awesome
This was a great video! Honestly inspiring, and something I think I might want to dedicate myself towards!!
I’m not crying, you’re crying. 😭
I ate mcdonald’s while i watched this
Loved how extra this video was, while still allowing for all that genuine Codyness to bring it down to earth.  Congrats on the video and the run, Little Man Ironman.
Choo choo cody motherfuckin choo
Proud of you Cody! You’re the best guy and congrats to you and kelsi
Integrating the baby videos was such a nice touch 🥹😭
hell yeah!
So effing proud of you Cody!
Cried the whole time.
fuck yes
Watching this before my morning run. ChooChoo🚂
Amazing video, would love to watch more of this style of content
Doing things because your younger siblings did them is peak big brother energy
Iron man australia yeeaahhh
Choo fkn Choo. You must be so damn proud of this video and yourself 🔥👌🏼
this is inspiring asf. great stuff cody my man
Imagining your son watching this video in the future and feeling the same way you did watching your parents makes me so emotional, you’re such an inspiration Cody and we are all so proud of you! Congrats on becoming an Ironman ♥️
so proud of you legend
The beginning of this is just like Surfs Up. Same name even
the end as a whole made me cry
This video is perfect, super strong dude being filmed by talented people. The editing is sick!
Cody Stark
Fuck yeah.  No other words
Awesome how u combined your own style with that of a classic documentary. Really enjoyed the watch!
Cody was the captain of his swimming team in university, even almost went to the olympics - tf you mean you knew nothing about the swimming lol
Not every day you get to see a 50 year old finish his first Ironman! Congrats Cody!
Going into my third Ironman this weekend at 22 years old and this got me a tad emotional! No one realises the hard work that goes into training for something like this and the sacrifices you make for it  A lot of emotions on race day!  Hope to see you on another start line and keep up with the vids cause there great!
such a good video good job
Damn i Love you 💖 very Big inspo in Everything you do
this actually made me a little emotional like i almost teared up, this is really beautiful cody. and the oppenheimer score in the background just ties it all together perfectly <3
I actually cried watching this wtf
The woman struggling to announce Cody's name is one of my favourite sound bites ever 😂
Cody ❤
Very cool
Ludwig Göransson is gonna sue your balls off.
So proud of you, Cody! You inspire me.
beautiful.
30 second ad is crazy but I’ll stick around for the goat
wtf is a mile?
i love everything about this video
This needs to be nominated for a Pulitzer and an Oscar
the squirrel at 7:00 is the main character here
this made me cry
3:07 I'm dead XD Thanks for this!
Love the Oppenheimer music in there. Nice touch
Frictionless
Wait, this isn't a RuneScape video?
Ok cool, now back to that’s cringe
"DON'T eat off the floor..." Haha
HOW DID THIS MAKE ME CRY
I think cody is one of the few youtubers who can produce a video that is satire and serious at the same time
i dont understand, why not use boat for water?
the Oppenheimer ost lol
Good job do another one
best video you made yet!
Why m i crying out of pride for someone I've never met
Why am I crying
This really hyped me up
I have  never in my life (44 yrs) been as proud as i am now of two people ive never met. Yes Kody did this race. But i can't help but know that Kelsey was very much apart of this race, before their wedding no doubt! My youtube heros ! Bravo Bravo Encore Encore 😊😊😊😊😊
Baby you is sooooo cute 😭
I love you Cody
The end almost made me cry, nothing beats the bond between a son and his dad
Investing in and betting on yourself and seeing all of your hard work come to fruition only to get a sudden injury that puts you on the sidelines is absolutely devastating; I’m a D1 athlete and this story has really resonated w me and inspired me as this has happened to me several times throughout my career. Putting all of that physical and mental energy into a project/passion/career of course leads to an inevitable emotional attachment, and this video visualizes those struggles and triumphs beautifully. These experiences are universal for anyone who is working hard for a goal, professionals and hobbyists 13:43 alike. We are all just out here trying to become the best version of ourselves in an area we are passionate about, and I love to see that Cody Ko has found his own interest that sets his soul on fire like running does for me :)
She said "oh eat off the floor for sure, just not on camera" hahaha
6:58 squirrel cameo
1945 is an… interesting year.
his parents just casually doing this multiple times amazes me haha
alriight ill do an ironman
Energy is everything.
This man has single handedly got my fitness back on track and I'm doing a half marathon next month. Without that Cody trains channel I wouldn't be where I'm mentally at. Love this family and everyone supporting everyone in the comments. Choo choo you guys!
omg cody fuck u for using can you hear the music this song has had such a grip on me since i watched oppenheimer it made this video so much better 😭
4:33 reminded me of Wade
I feel like this is Cody’s YEAR dude!
why am I crying
I'm not crying you’re crying! Congratulations man, amazing watching you do this 🎉
Really amazing video Cody the production value for 1 YouTube video is insane
which episode of the button is this?
Little Cody learning to ride a bike got me tearing up every time 🥲
"It's not in slo-mo, it's in normal mo" - Cody Ko
Cody we love you. You're such a positive influence on the world. Thank you for inspiring me and pushing me to make my life better.
This was literally the best video I’ve seen Cody you’re amazing
Amazing production, amazing story, amazing performance, amazing guy and family. GOAT
Did anyone else cry..? No? Just me?
Good for you Cody 🥰
god i hope this becomes joke somehwere
The Oppenheimer soundtrack is soon point
the goat
thanks alot man, the kids are crying
I cried and I will continue to cry, I love this man and his family
stop... I love this:)) so inspirational
I know this comment will get lost, but I love this video. As much as I love your content, this video specifically sticks out the most to me out of all of yours. It's real and genuine and has just that little bit of Cody Ko humor we all know and love. Congrats on being an Iron man and I wish you and Kelsey the best going forward.
Thumbnail lookin like that old aladdin meme
kinda stupid to use the oppenheimer sound track
i love you cody 🔥
GOR CORDY!!!!!
man you got me crying
Not the same type of goal at all, but my goal is to work really hard at my job to save up to do some road trips spring of next year. I've been stuck in a rut the past few years and have been tired of not achieving any goals.   So this video came out at a great time for me. You may regret it in the moment as you're dealing with all the aches and pains, but for the rest of your life you can say you're an Ironman!!! that's so cool, and becoming a DJ because you truly want to do it. That's what life seems to be about to me, or at least the most rewarding. Is setting goals for yourself, and constantly trying to improve.  I definitely feel more life in me now that I have some goals setup again, I really don't want to waste too much more time. Energy is everything!!
Amazing Cody, I was training for my first Ironman 70.3 during your build for this race. So helpful and refreshing to see someone else battling the issues I was going through at the time! Choochoo
That's Cringe
Dawg wtf is in your parents water that’s insane
What you said about family was incredible. Congrats Cody
Gotta say that this is one of the best videos I’ve ever seen  congrats again, keep it up dude💖
not the Oppenheimer music omg
cool video! very nice done
Chills bro, chills...
I was sitting there in awe at the end and then the recommended video thumbnail popped up of couple’s cringe with the horny chef sticking his fingers down his throat 😂
This was so incredibly sweet and inspiring! I’m so impressed, I honestly didn’t know Cody had this kind of dedication and drive. Amazing. What a journey! I’m so proud of you!
Homie enlisted Oppenheimer music doesn’t get much better
Oppenheimer music for the climax 🤌🏽
this made me tear up so bad!!!
The Oppenheimer music fits everything
cody looks like chris from the first series of skins uk omg 0:41
THIS was so well shot OMG...Seeing Kelsey being named as his wife was so emotional! They´ve come such a long way without ever changing negatively. Gosh we love you both! CODY YOU DID IT!!!!!!!!!!!
:') ofcourse i cried
so proud of our boy cody !!!!
using the Oppenheimer soundtrack was a good move
I love this video so much because it’s an amazing insight in what being an athlete is really like and all the ups and down you go through 🫶
This makes me want to drop everything im doing and just train my ass off to do an iron man!!!! A man of many talents, cody can make you laugh and smile, but man was that some of the most genuine and motivating videos, congrats cody 🎉🎉
this was so amazing. congrats dude
Beautifully done 🥲
Well done Cody!!!
Main character moment
“I knew nothing about swimming” said the collegiate diver
How the fcuk were you able to make me cry on THIS video?!?!
Inspiration to us all, and good serious vid haha didnt think you had it in you
this was absolutely moving to watch and you did an amazing thing just inspiring so many others with cody trains as well. congratulations cody! thanks for putting this out there. energy is everything! 🤍
the way you and your crew put this together is so beautiful congrats cody!
This is such a sick accomplishment and I love the throwback videos. But sorry marrying into an Ironman family would be my nightmare 😂
👏👏👏
Congrats cody! for everything, such an amazing time in your life
🏃‍♂️♥️
I really liked this. Everything about it.
why did i cry
CHOO CHOO CODY!!!!
This was so wholesome and well-edited and I love how you commit to everything you do, but still don’t take yourself too seriously!
Did I hear Oppenheimer music soundtrack can you hear the music?, nice the music really went with the moment
Putting Oppenheimer music during the Ironman section made it that much more amazing! Congrats Cody! You’re a legend
LITERALLY INSPIRED ME TO TRAIN EVEN HADER TO REACH MY GOALS
the background music godamn we got kajillionare and everything everywhere all at once scores?!?!?!? are u trying to kill me why do u want me to cry so bad.
I don't ever leave comments but I just got to say, as a fellow son of a dad who's been an Ironman, this is inspiring me to check that box too and do what my old man did. I can only imagine what it was like to see the look on your dad's face and say "that's my boy!" I'd like to see that face on my dad one day. Thank you, Cody.
what a legend
bro moneyball music HAHAHA love it
WE love you 3000
Cinematography is peak, this whole thing is peak and now I want to start running again
Im so glad i clicked on this. This was everything 😭 i had no idea how integral iron man was for Cody and his family!
Hands down one of the best videos ive ever seen....
CHOO CHOO
As someone who fractured their spine, and then twice while recovering, this relates 😭😂
I don’t get it this isn’t a Cut video
congrats Cody!!!
Fuck,. Anyone else crying?
we get it you did the IRONMAN bro
CHOO CHOO!!!
Theory can only take you so far
My inspiration. So incredibly proud of you
The Oppenheimer music took this to Another level
Congatulations Cody, Such an inspiration to the older generation!
this feels like a tech startup pitch deck. #choochiegang
this is amazing and makes me want to become an iron man
W
Wow I’m like bawling
This was so inspiring! Congratulations Cody!
went from button videos to making the most inspiring video any of us have seen in a while.
Damn I wish I had a little bit of money.
I had no idea Cody thought the movie was that good it’s a 6/10 for me
The massage gun killed me everytime
So inspiring to see it all summed up from beginning to end after watching all those videos each week that led the race! Thank you for sharing your experience that’s honestly so relatable in any world where fitness is at a high level. Congratulations again!
cody is the man
Shed a tear or two at the end there, ngl. Congrats cody 🙏
Oppenheimer score went hard

I'm crying this is so sweet

damn it kody this gave me proud mom tears
This was phenomenal
I love this so much. It genuinely brought a few tears to my eyes and many laughs. Thank you
You’re such an inspiration to all. This is a moving story.
“I knew nothing about swimming” *Literally went to college for water sports*
ENERGY IS EVERYTHING
This got me emotional. What an unbelievable achievement, this was beautiful!
Sheeshhh congratulations!  🎊 Proud of you! This was actually very inspiring❤
I am so proud of you Cody and so happy to be apart of your journey from beginning to end. You have inspired me so much. I can't wait to do my ironman one day because of you <3
Wow the 13 minutes flew by so quick this is such a great video
Cody becoming Dre drexler
why am i emotional
Didn’t even win smh
It’s great to know Cody Ko should actually be pronounced Cody Kah
Pretty incredible!
This is genuinely one of Cody’s best videos, I absolutely love the comedy content but this really just hit me right in the feels man, I’ve been considering taking up running lately as a challenge to myself to get healthy, lose some weight and just be happier with myself, I find myself making excuses but this video and honestly all of the Cody trains videos have grounded me and made me feel like I can do absolutely anything I set my mind to.  Thank you Cody, you’re an inspiration ❤
how tf did this make me cry
Oppenheimer Music hits
cody this video is on epic mode. congratulations, we are all so proud of you!!!
cody youre so good at what you do
Awesome film! Love how culminating it felt
I think this video perfectly sums up what “energy is everything” means. Being surrounded by likeminded people, love, support, and inspiration. Very proud! I hope one day I can do this for myself as well.
this is the most wholesome shit i've ever watched
As a fellow married saggiteorist .. I get it. Beautifully done cody!!!! Congratulations!!!!! 💕💕💕💕💕
I love you Cody Kodhdjkdjsfhsdgfsdksjhskd!!!!!!!
The Oppenheimer track goes hard
This was so inspiring ❤😊
I’m crying 😭
I love this documentary style
????????????????????????????????
So inspirational, but cocaine is a hell of a drug 😅
That was beautiful Cody. Great work. 👏🎬🥇
The video was great but the use of the Oppenheimer soundtrack was phenomenal
This was really beautiful man. Thank you. The production value is incredible also.
Oppenheimer music goes crazy
this is why I love you, Cody...you make me laugh when I need one, motivate the hell out of me with your training/accomplishments, and in this vid get me a bit teared up. bout to start my training up again because of this man. thanks for ALL you do. much love to you bro
this made me tear up!!!!! YOU GAUR CAURDYY CHOOUR CHOURRR!!!
I love the social network music in the background
Cody I would love it if you did a collab with the guy who makes “energy is everything” hats and make some merch using that line with some Cody flare in it or at least a merch that says “stair master”
Tell me why tf I'm crying at a video from the same guy who joked about c*m powder
I'm fucking crying! Lol this definitely inspired me to get up off my ass and work out
This is such a beautiful video! Congrats Cody 🎉 on all you have accomplished
This was such an amazing watch! I’ve ran a marathon, and it is one of the greatest moments of my life, but now I feel inspired to push myself further and try an Ironman. Congratulations Cody ❤️🎉
the use of the home videos was so good, so proud of you cody!!
This was so incredibly inspiring Cody!
The Oppenheimer music 😂
I hope this video gets the recognition it deserves. Such a well put together short film documentary and an incredible story.
I’m actually crying, it’s been such a great journey watching Cody meet Kelsey, when she was first introduced on his channel, to them getting married, and now expecting a baby!!! AND he becomes an Iron Man. Hell yeah dude. You’re absolutely winning 🥇
Dude this is a whole movie this is crazy and I love it! Congrats you deserve the world
I'm balling my eyes out right now😢  Well done Cody, this was a beautiful and inspiring video.❤❤
Thank you
This was so awesome Cody, you’re amazing.
lowkey flexing
"Can you hear the music" from oppenheimer was a perfect choice
Proud of you brother! This is awesome!
*signs up for ironman
This made me so emotional, caught me so off guard hahaha now I gotta go back to work and I am weeping 😂
Aw go Cody code!
ive never been so proud of someone that i will never meet :)
Congratulations Cody! Hope I can do something like this one day.
Pushing through the injury is SO impressive. I’ve been wrestling my whole life and I took 6th, 4th, 3rd in state going into my senior year, then a month bf state I tore my MLC and patellar tendon, the mental battle to go to PT twice a day and not get to wreslte and watch my wieght become unmanageable and my conditioning go to crap was terrible. I ended up taking 6th after being undefeated before my injury, it’s the most proud I’ve been of any tournament because I never had a mental battle like that. So PROPS to you. People don’t know how mentally destroying an injury can be after months of training.
The music from Oppenheimer fit so much more frictionlessly here than in the movie itself. So inspiring!
Cody you’re the goat
Ok 👍
Kinda poetic that your boy was there for your first Ironman like you were there for your dads. Granted he might not remember it but still
amazing job on the video and amazing job creating your dream life. so proud of you!!
the “what about your little boy 😡” made me laugh out loud
Literally cried watching this, it’s just wild to see how much you have accomplished in the last 5 years or so. You have inspired me so much, I wish I could thank you for sharing your experience with us. Keep going, keep inspiring us!! 🩷🩷🩷
Certified cinematic masterpiece!! 👌🏻
new goal
This is incredible, so proud, so inspiring
i'm so proud of u homie, you're quite awesome
So proud of you Cody! I’m planning on running my first ever half marathon in February (which feels like nothing compared to what you’ve accomplished) but watching your training videos and seeing how far you’ve come has helped me stay focused on my goal. Wish me luck! I’m gonna need it 😬
This made me kinda emotional. You worked hard. You did it. I didn't follow along, but I almost feel like I should have. You are an inspiring person Cody. You're doing the right stuff.
not the social network music at 5:40 ur so real for that
look at cody man so inspiring
this is too serious for me😭
Iron mans are extremely easy... but cmon man, look at the body of olympic sprinters vs olympic long distance runners... we arent designed to run for long periods of time. You're going to regret it later on.
Incredible man!!!
Sick video Chody
At first i thought this was about crentis
Cody, I was training for the LA Marathon during this, & I remember every single clip. I remember all your struggle & success, which made me push that much harder in my own training. One of the reasons I joined the LA marathon was to hopefully bump into you, considering we are around the same pace. Nonetheless, Congrats on this MAJOR accomplishment man. An inspiration to us all
That slowed down version of its a beautiful day slaps
Honestly, Cody's journey is the perfect example of how a man should grow in life
Beautifully done :)
I love all Cody’s videos but I didn’t think I would like something like this from him but this vid is really compelling. Impressed that I am so interested in his story hahaha
👏👏
Been watching Cody content for almost a decade and I genuinely got choked up watching this. Incredibly happy for him and the life he’s living
Thank you for sharing this Cody it's a beautiful story and I am so happy for you. Well done 👏🏻
This was so well done and such a beautiful short documentary. Huge props to the editor as well. So proud of Cody and all that he has accomplished. Energy is everything!!
This is so inspirational- but I can’t swim so I think I’d fail… I also can’t ride a bike - I also don’t like running but my sister also can’t so I don’t have to worry about having to do this out of competition 😂
The moneyball music right at the start got me instantly invested
Awesome content! Really needed this in my life right now. I have a half marathon in 2 months and need to get back to training right. Thanks for the inspiring and motivational message. Almost shed a tear at the end
So cute
so inspiring - congrats cody 🫶🏼
You're doing it wrong with the tape your supposed to take 1 strip cut it in half that supposed to be put right underneath your kneecap and then the long piece goes over like you have it on yours 8:10
from frat to an engaged ironman dad
why am i crying
This video SLAPPED me into oblivion. Absolute BANGER from Cody Ko! Congrats on such a humongous accomplishment!
Ayy
choo choo
Is nobody going to talk about the Oppenheimer music
Cody, could I possibly become Kelsey’s Sister Wife? Serious answers only.
The way this dude lives his life is so motivational
This is the most beautiful thing I have ever watched wow
this actually made me cry
So awesome and inspiring, congrats Cody! Just wonder how the heck do you find time / manage SO. MANY. ACTIVITIES at the same time?! your discipline and schedule mgmt must be impeccable. Congrats!!
SO PROUD OF YOU!!
Cody, more like goaty
LMAO the oppenheimer music
The first time I watched a Cody trains video, I went for a run while it played, rolled my ankle and got in a boot for about a month and a half.   I don’t run much anymore but I took up jump rope lol  This video is genuinely inspiring, great work Cody
cody ur so awesome ive been watching u for agesss now (even on vine was a big fan… just saying) ur personality still shines even in a more serious video like this. You’re so awesome!!!!
this is honestly the sickest video you have ever posted, and that's saying a lot because I love every video you post.
best short film of the year Cody
The Oppenheimer music goes so hard, great vid
Super cool. I wish I could dedicate myself to something like this one day!
Becoming an ironman at the age of 60? You're a god damn inspiration, Grandpa Cody!
Inspiration at it’s finest, thank you Cody
Okayyyy Oppenheimer score👏🏻
Cody turning into Oppenheimer
Congratulations Cody! Hard work pays off. Thanks for sharing your story. 👏👏👏

Wait, this isn’t the button

As a physicist energy really is everything. Well along with momentum but really they are just 2 sides of the same 4 vector coin.
why did i start crying bro
That’s crazy that your sister did the Iron Man, Chattanooga, I have a friend of mine that has done it many many times. It’s legit.
Love the Oppenheimer sound track being used for the climax, fit so well
But was mattysmokes there?
I am so proud of you. As a cousin, as a viewer, as a fan. You are ironman! ❤️🤘🏼 We love you and can’t wait to see what you keep achieving!
#Normal-Mo

This was awesome cody!
Not the Social Network OST in the background... Beautiful video Cody.
Cody is an inspiration
Who’s cutting onions 🥹 so proud of you Cody!!!
Aw your dad calling you Code was so cute
So proud of you Cody !
Bro really became an Ironman just to make a YouTube video out of it lol
Okay this video made me cry and want to get back into running
the coolest! thank you for always inspiring us, chodes. we stan a right one! 🫶🏻
Not the Oppenheimer music 😂
This documentary is me every Thanksgiving for the 30min Turkey Trot. Not all heroes wear capes ✊🏻😂
congrats Cody!! we’re so proud of you!!
Amazing in what it is, but a bit too overproduced for my personal taste. Great mini film though
Sending this to ludwig rn
Cody what an amazing effort! My brother is literally doing the exact same thing at the perth australia iron man in December, never done a marathon, triathlon or iron man before. Will definitely be showing him this!
That would be crazy and hilarious if at like family events and other times Cody’s parents and little sister where actually making fun of him for not doing it yet 🤣. Like he walks into the kitchen at a holiday with the family and everyone is laughing out loud and they all just stop and pretend to be doing something else 😬 “Heyyy Cody we are just talking about some things, defiantly not you” ….
Brought a tear to my eye seeing you finish after working so hard and hearing you talk ab your parents being there with you😢 congrats Cody much love❤
can he just use oppenheimer music??
the oppenheimer music goes so hard ibr
This video is to Cody as Oppenheimer is to Nolan
Shit i wanna cry
I ship off for Basic Training tomorrow, Ive been apprehensive about all the running and conditioning thatll take place, being 26 now. And seeing this gave me such a huge spark of motivation and determination. Ill finish BT, and still wont be able to imagine being an Ironman. Congrats Cody, youre a true inspiration, and a legend. Happy for you!
This is making me emotional! Congrats Cody!
This is INSANEEEEE

the way i just balled so hard i’m so proud of you !
Cody! This was amazing man, been following you since almost the beginning, over 6-7 yrs of entertainment. Seeing this video come together is so awesome. The team you have now is so awesome, just thank you from me and the millions of other followers that you have inspired & entertained. Can't wait to see you AND US grow.

Love you Cody Ko! Keep it going!
Love the inclusion of The Social Network and Oppenheimer music 😍
How did Cody get the rights to use the Oppenheimer music? Great song choice though, really created tension in the video 10:42
7:00 JESUS CHRIST how big is that F**king squirrel!? Think of the perspective… how it’s in the background… that F**kerbis almost as big as a cat WTF
‘Can you hear the music’ starts playing, that’s when I get chills ahah, great vid
Congrats keep it up

The popcorn shot at 10:53 took me out 💀 amazing work!

The Social Network music hitting different on this one.
Why am I crying in the club right now?
why am i crying
the oppenheimer theme goes so fucking hard tho
Okay but what if you have to pee during an iron man 😂 or are you sweating so much that you don’t? I assume they have portapotties but idk its funny to think about taking a potty break during an iron man 😂 honestly though this is so amazing you really did THAT! Not very many people can do what you did 💪🏻
CHOO! CHOO!
I clicked this thinking he was going to play RuneScape
Congratulations man fr I’m so happy for u
choosing the oppenhimer song was HUGE congrats cody. god speed
you’re so inspiring cody!
Thank you for being the YouTuber that I grew up watching that I can still watch. I’m 23 now and I feel like your content has grown up with me.
This was incredible, love seeing all the vids from Cody trains come together into such a thoughtful and funny piece of work. You’re inspiring fr 🩷
Beautiful !👏🏽
so cheesy on the documentary style but it works lol
I didn’t expect to cry because of a Cody Ko video
That’s insane
This is by far my favorite Cody video so much accomplished. You are truly an old man now 🫶🏽
I'm not crying watching a Cody Ko video right now what the hell bro
Great video, was waiting for the fan footage!
Cody you are such an inspiration, arguably your best video. Thank you for constantly entertaining us and now inspiring us.
Really great video Cody. I think the dramatic headshot with the projection of popcorn really did it for me. Two thumbs up!
followed Cody Trains for a while before Iron Man and was so proud and excited watching you live out that dream. I’ve been so excited for this to come up on the main channel and the Oppenheimer music DID NOT DISAPPOINT bro! We ascend together!! Congratulations, Cody.
conclusion: cody is HIM
suzie did it better honestly, you were never morbidly obese.
so proud of you ironman Cody!!
I'm so proud of you Cody!!! Congrats on the baby, marriage, and doing the Ironman with your family.
this is amazing

Not only was this so well made but it was cool to see Cody so proud and excited like that. Well done Cody🥳
Seeing stuff like this keeps inspiring my dreams to do something great one day. Much love Cody!
Amazing video, really inspiring 💪🏼

So proud of you!! ❤
Holy shit great video. I usually don’t watch you anymore since COVID since you’re videos are ehh. But this was great. Production was great, you were as funny as your are on the podcast, and I was intrigued.  Also good shit Cody! You’re family are Iron Men and two girls.

Cody Koppenheimer

Hearing “Can You Hear the Music” gave me chills!! Congrats Cody very inspiring video
You are so inspiring I'm so happy for you congratulations !!
Just wonderful

Why am I crying
Didn’t think I would CRY when I clicked on this thanks a lot!
Can't wait for Cody to get pregnant after his sister does.
Cody I know you wanna choo choo but stay off the fuckin’ LA metros, you’re gonna get mugged.
This is so fucking sick
This honestly choked me up 😢
I'm so emotional this is so well done and just so inspiring
the race soundtrack is "Can You Hear The Music" from Oppenheimer....lfg
Congrats! I’ve been a long time watcher and it is a super amazing feat! Have a great day dude! Nice one
Dude! Great job!! I love the oppenheimer music at the end, really captured the moment
fantastic and inspiring documentary style video. here’s to hoping it gets the love it deserves. i have been pushing myself to train at the gym lately and i am tempted to try for a marathon.
I would like this a thousand times if I could. Well done, brother!
Ehh, I'm not in the mood for being inspired right now, so I'm gonna stick with your other videos.
so this is why he uploads 2 reaction videos a month.
10:40 Is that the song from Oppenheimer
Its funny part iron man wasn't part of the wedding, but DJing was.
this is so wonderful and wholesome 🥲
Why am I crying
You do many things Cody ko.  Many things
The movie soundtracks playing in the background made this such a vibe
❤️❤️❤️

Cody’s this Cody’s that, Cody is me bro, let me be me.
The people at the finish line with the “Cody Trains” signs 🥹🥹🥹
This was a awesome! Your Cody trains channel started right when I was told I was inching close to being prediabetic and you inspired me to start running! No longer anywhere near being prediabteic and I actually enjoy the pain of running for the first time in my life! This was so inspiring, I’m excited to see what you do next!
awwwwwwww
I love this
why am i CRYING the clips of cody as a child with his bike this is SO SWEET
When u cry during a cody ko video
Openheimer soundtrack made this incredible
Cody's parents are savage
This was actually really inspirational man. I'm your age, in Austin, have been pursuing some things in my life but lately having doubts because I'm getting slightly older. This fucking helped a ton. You have a healthy headspace my dude- that comment about being self serving- very on point!
I just watched a 2 hour documentary in 13 minutes. This was a really captivating video! I’m inspired
This was hilarious
thank you cody
so proud of u
This is easily your best video ever, and that’s still a compliment to your other videos. You’re killing it.
Kelsey and Cody when he finished, I can't wait to see how amazing they will be as parents
lol they put the Oppenheimer soundtrack in here
Love the Oppenheimer music
Please see this: Could you please do a detailed cost breakdown? I really wanna do one too, but money deffo is kinda an issue and it would be very interesting to see how much u spent and where one could save.
kajillionare soundtrack goes
How did you get the rights for the song? Anyways, love you.
cody made the ironman cool
CAN YOU HEAR THE MUSIC AT THE END NO WAY
COH DEE KOLOGSIGCHUS 🤌🤌🤌
love you cody
Amazing cody! You and your whole family!
You are such a huge inspiration to me. You are a living example of what can happen when you don’t limit yourself. I am always amazed that you pursue so many things, and you give every single one 100%. I want to be like you one day. Thank you.
We ascend together. Choo choo.
That Oppenheimer music hits hard on this one
this was beautiful.
I'm losing it. my dad did bike races, and I always wished I could do that, but it seems so scary to start. this was an awesome video and gave me a lot of emotions
YouTube rarely makes me cry, but watching this video I've never been more moved and motivated. you're helping create really great people in this world, what an amazing video with such amazing people

This video is fucking beautiful, thank you.
The Oppenheimer soundtrack at 10:00 goes hard.
Way to goooo🎉🎉🎉
Love the use of Oppenheimer soundtrack, makes it so much more epic
I’ve been watching your channel for years, it’s been so incredible growing up with you, watching you achieve amazing things and seeing you embrace all of the ups and downs and changes in your life. You inspire joy and gratitude in all of us.
okay so when are you running 1000 miles CODY
Cody AUSTRALIA?? Australia for your first ironman are you insane?? Or are you an inspiration??
Dude this video was so cool!!!!!! Amazing quality as always, Cody. Congrats!!
GAUR CODYY we ascend together
amazing. You are an inspiration on so many levels. This is the golden standard of living a fulfilling life: recognize your blessings, challenge yourself and dream big
Please make more biopics 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Like the Oppenheimer music during the part showing the race, banger
Cody trains helped motivate me after doing my MCL at soccer/football & then becoming a dad I wasn't training anymore, this definitely made me want to get into running and get back to where I was with my fitness. This October I'm running, 4.2km every hour, on the hour for 24 hours to total 100km for a charity event here in Australia. Going to be a big task but I'm pumped!
Cody you inspired me to sign up for my first triathlon and yesterday I finished the race. I’m 23 years old, just graduated college less than a year ago, and I’ve been a fan of your videos since you started YouTube. I love your normal videos but these are my favorites. You’ve been a really positive role model for me and many others and we’re all very happy for you. Thank you for being a continuous source of inspiration and great content and I wish you and Kelsey the best of luck with your baby on the way. I know you guys will be the best parents. Cheers!
the oppenheimer music was an exquisite choice
I wanna do an Ironman too now! Oh shit, nvm - forgot I can't swim...
not the Oppenheimer soundtrack LMAO
I didn’t know they put the year that you were born on your chest when you do an Ironman
Wait to do it , Cody.
Incredible, wow so inspiring. I wish I could do something like this but I have COPD so I like only know how to swim to save my life and can't run very far
Littlesister with the backwards cap. Runs in the family
I’m not kidding, I started crying watching this. Cody, you’re truly such an inspiring and kind person and the journey you’ve taken with so much emotion invested into it is incredible. I know that you’ll be just as good of a father to your kid/kids as your parents were to you. Keep going Cody, we love and admire you so much.
This is is beautifully made and inspiring. I love seeing this part of Cody's life and seeing him grow this way. We love you man.
This is so sick!!! Let’s go Cody!!
wathing papa Ko train every week for 8 months, my man, Loved it every week sooo much.  All the way from Belgium!   Big congrats again,  kind regards from Average Robert also!
So does this mean you're not using the grand exchange anymore?
this was truly beautiful
Can’t believe the first 2 minutes of this video made me cry. I’m also very unstable rn so there is that.
this is the most wholesome video I've seen, man. Cody and Kelsey and the family are just so awesome.
Cody made a nick bare video
It feels so satisfying to watch this video after having watched every Cody Trains video week by week since September last year. We ascend together, forever <3
so proud of you! also this video is absolute art
It's the lady desperately trying to anounce Cody's name at the end for me. Congrats on becoming an Ironman!!
got me crying on the beach rn
How much is it to register for the race?
Dude I’m crying watching this! My partner did the half Ironman in Australia and we cheered you on when you were on your last lap.. you inspire us!!! We love you ❤
Gotta love the Oppenheimer music at the end hahahahah. Seriously, dope vid.
I need a challenge like this in my life
cody you are one of the most incredible people i’ve ever seen
This was put together so beautifully! Love the hard work 💪 keep grinding Cody!
This was beautiful
Thanks for letting us stand on that rock wall for you this time, Mate. Legend
Good stuff!  But I couldn't help but think throughout the whole video... my man, you act like straight up boomer 🤣
An absolutely fantastic video!
this video was the best video you’ve ever made cody, very inspiring, cried at the end 😭
W
I can’t take this man serious
I started watching your videos when you covered the button. You and your wife make a great combo and you appeal to a wide audience. I’m almost 40 and find your content entertaining.
Nice touch with the Oppenheimer music
This made me cry, I am a little buzzed but still. Very touching
Cody using the score from The Social Network as background music for this is the most tech bro thing he’s ever done
When’re you getting the calf tattoo?
I hope you understand Cody how great of an inspiration you are
Why am I crying. What the fuck Cody.
Not going to lie I cried lol congrats Cody on being an Ironman and for becoming a dad much love
Cody using the Everything Everywhere All At Once and the Oppenheimer soundtrack in sections of this hit different
i love this man
This is so amazing and I’ve watched the whole journey
THIS VIDEO WAS FREAKING AWESOME
im crying...
Ur the best Cody!
Sad that there wasn’t a single “Choo Choo”
Honestly believe all humans have a story to tell, and this was that story for Cody. Even though he makes funny/silly content, this was that video that made sense and culminates this whole channel.
One of my biggest dreams is to meet Cody no joke
thats inspiring AF!
this made me tear up dude i've been following cody so long and this video made me feel so proud of him and what he's been able to accomplish
i could do it
🐐
IS ZADES NAME FUCKING ZADOK!?
Hearing Cody’s dad’s Canadian accent in the clips of him as a kid warmed my heart
First time ive cried in a year watching this. I dont know why. Amazing.
crazy to think i was watching you make out of focus vlogs at work a few years ago. this video was very well made, excellent work with both this vid and the race!
Next step, Cody because an IronMan... IN RUNESCAPE LETS GO BABY WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this is so sick, great job Cody 👏 i'm running in the Virginia 10 Miler for the first time this year, thank you for the inspiration!
Aw man, this video made me cry. Cody, bother, you are truly so inspiring. You have made your platform such a beautiful place to display the triumph of the human spirit, specifically your own, of course, and I can’t thank you enough for it. You make me want to be a better version, the best version of myself. God bless you Cody, you are truly an incredible person, and as a long time viewer, I’m so proud of you brother. Energy is everything.
Congrats on actually completing the ironman Cody
Now Kelsey
kinda beautiful
Did Cody really get clearance to use the song “In Motion” from the social network soundtrack?
Cody your my favorite transgender youtuber
this was such a good documentary It really shows cody’s range as a creator
MFer has the perfect life. Supportive wife & family and living in a sexy house,  I want to hate him but it's impossible.
It made me tear up. It was beautiful
dj irondad
The epitome of sibling rivalry lmaooo with a twin, myself, I totally get this 😂😂 but this is so awesome!! Congratulations!!
i love that this is exactly like Surfs Up
The Oppenheimer soundtrack at the end was such an amazing way to cap it off
Really enjoyed the video, and the story behind this ironman. Congrats Cody!
Literally in right now. That was such a beautiful video, so inspirational. Crying too bc Cody and Kelsey are expecting and I’m just so happy for him and them
LETS GO CODY
Literally started crying when you reached the goal and talked about your father. What a great family story! So much love between you guys, I'm so happy for you!❤
I'm starting to think Cody knows a lil somethin' about fitness
sick video
goodass documentary bro wholesome as fuck
I’m in tears 😢❤ beautiful super inspiring EXCELLENT piece of content
cody, we're all so proud of you!!! this was so well made and had me tearing up at the end! Choo Chooo!!!
Lmao it took him months to make this 😭💀
Cody you are such an inspiration! I followed your journey and today I signed up for a sprint marathon with the goal of doing an iron man one day! Also huge congrats with the baby 🥳
WHY AM I CRYING!!! Let's go Cody!
Remember when Cody was a just vine kid? Now he’s a YouTuber, Ironman, almost a husband and father, respected DJ, comedian, and actor. Love to see him winning 🎉
Cody looks so good in this quality
proud of you, man
Amazing job and an amazing video. The Oppenheimer track combined with A Beautiful Day at the end gave me goosebumps and also made me shed some tears.  To do something like this and to really push your mental and physical barriers is incredible, something that I believe everyone should do at some point.  Congratulations on everything, I’m happy for you!
This gave me goosebumps. Your parents seem amazing you’re lucky to have them! You will be a great dad too 🥹
Love the Oppy score there are the end. 👌🏻👌🏻
I cried watching this ✨ congrats Cody
12:22 That's pretty fitting since Cody is going to have a baby
Love the video but all i could notice was the Social Network and Oppenheimer soundtrack in the background
I love that Cody is a fitness influencer
Does ANYONE have a coin?
Social network soundtrack is BUMPING
This isn't a Runescape video I'm out of here.
DAMN the cinematography is on point ! Fantastic video and congrats on doing an Ironman, it's fantastic !
Congratulations Dharmann...              congrats for real though been following your ironman journey for a while.
The Oppenheimer music!!
this is very frictionless
The Social Network Soundtrack coming on in the background was so fitting lmao
Beautiful film
Loving the Social Network music, nice touch 😅. Amazing work, Cody!! 🎉🎉
When i saw the beginning of the video i thought it was sarcasm like a mockumentary (American vandal).   I know ofc he did an Ironman and love the story behind. Just the vibes the video gave off
Cody.... ugh I LITERALLY LOVE SUPPORTING YOU.. AS DO WE ALLL.. YOU FEEL LIKE A BESTIE!! energy IS everything cody. This was incredible and the journey.. can this FR be a documentary??? 😅😃😃 you killer it cody, you and kelsey are remarkable individuals and you're going to make even COOLER parents ❤❤❤❤
Let’s go coryyyyy
You, our friend, are nothing short of an absolute champion.  CHOO CHOO!
Frictionless
This is awesome
Not the Oppenheimer soundtrack lmao this was really amazing
My favorite part was when he said "an I am Iron Man", and then snapped
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
PETTY KING! Just did it to beat your sister, I’m weakkk 😂 all seriousness tho this was great mini doc proud of you Cody!
You are my favourite youtuber so inspiring and you keep growing and proving that you can do more congratulations 🤩🤩
That’s Cody Ko’s dad’s boy! He’s an Ironman
amazing video
I’m crying. This was so well put together but still true to you! This has been a fun journey to watch through!! Congratulations!!
our boy is an iron man ❤
Love this! Training for a Spartan Race now!
Love the Oppenheimer Soundtrack in the background
This is not only your best video, but one of the best videos on YouTube.
Wake up babe 🗣️🗣️ codyud Kopchogi documentary dropped 🗣️🗣️🗣️
you did it, i cried
Man the end of this video had me tearing up. I’ve been watching Cody’s videos for years and seeing him accomplish this goal made me so happy. Congrats and what a great freaking short film!!!
Props to the production team! Cody should make more stuff like this.
Such a good video! Thank you for sharing a slice of your past and your family with us. From someone who didn’t get to experience this kind of family life, it’s so warming to watch this and experience it with you 🥰
Why am I crying. This was beautiful ❤️ very motivating
I trained to do a 140 mile cycle June this year for ages. Halfway through I crashed, ended up with flail rib breaks and a hip fracture, around 10 breaks into total. Recovery sucks.
Needless to say mate, I'm so fucking proud of you. I'm not easily inspired, but "energy is everything" and "we ascend together" have become completely unironic parts of my boyfriend's and my vocabularies, and seeing everything you've defeated to get to this point is just incredible. Big love mate <3
I miss stairmaster Cody
7:58
Yes I cried.
Wait why did this make me cry
So cool! 🎉
Following Cody Trains and knowing how it ended, I still got emotional watching this. What a wonderful way to bring the full story to life, especially now knowing you had just found out you were going to be a dad!! GAUR CORDY!!!!!
No I’m not crying you are
netflix presents
Cody dude you literally always inspire me. Thanks for being the man.
really inspiring Cody, not sure if it’s the type of thing I would ever wanna do, but it really is a testament to the human spirit and really admirable :)
As soon as I heard "can you hear the music" from Oppenheimer at 10 mins I got chills, props to the editor for perfect music selection
Not even going to lie this is by far one of your best vids Ko. . .genuinely inspiring me to get back to my work Out routine. . .
Does anyone have a clue the name of the backing song that starts around 1:40 and goes until 2:20? I've heard it before but I can't place it and it's killing me
That honestly made me tear up towards the end when he finally became an Ironman. Huge props to Cody and his whole family! All of this makes me want to start training for a marathon or even an Ironman!
why am i crying rn 😭😭fr tho what a sick accomplishment cody 🫶🏼
This was amazing and so inspiring!! Congrats big dog
BRILLIANT video! Shoutout to the awesome production team (loved the Oppenheimer score too)! Thanks for bringing us along on your journey Cody! CHOO CHOO!
I cried.
Not you having the Oppenheimer music when the race clips start LMFAOO 😭 It’s very fitting though, this is such a wild accomplishment!
Congrats!!! This is really beautiful!!
This the first video I’ve actually taken the time to like
This was fucking brilliant content. Made me tear up. Choo mf choo, energy is everything, we ascend together🚅
I LOVE THE OPPENHEIMER EDITS HAHAHA
Okay but why did this make me cry
Editor praise! (Appreciate the Oppenheimer music too)
I wish this was like 5 times as long
The Oppenheimer tune, yes Cody
This is clearly a huge moment for you in your life and I can speak for us all when I say I am extremely proud of you.
This was good :)
Hit us with the Oppenheimer music?!?! 😭😭
great job man
This hit me over breakfast I’m tearing up rn. I have my first powerlifting in 2-3 years this weekend this just hit some motivation 😭🙌🏻
Boy did I read this title wrong. I thought Marvel made a very weird casting choice.
Beautiful
Absolutely beautiful video
This actually made me emotional, we are all so proud of you & I aspire to have your dedication in life thank you ❤
Wow Cody and Felix, two of my all time fav Youtubers, just KILLING it at the game of life recently. Both became a dad and are accomplishing huge milestones. I couldn't be more happy for them.
I’ll do one one day when I can afford a bike lol. I’ll stick to marathons for now 😅
Choo choo!!!
Amazing ❤
Easily one of the coolest Cody Ko videos. Inspiring message and beautiful editing. Congratulations!
Cody really be making me cry god damn
choochies assemble 🚂🫡
The way Cody found out he was having a son the DAY before he left for Australia 🥲🥹
CHOO CHOO
love the oppenheimer music in the background
The clips of you as a kid on your bike with your dad encouraging you are so damn wholesome man, don't know what to do with all the feels..
One of my all time favorite Cody Ko videos! Love this!
So proud of you❤
This was really amazing
I love how supportive Kelsey is ❤️❤️
We love a reminder that our entertainers have real life experiences and emotions, proud of you!!
the oppenheimer music
Why am I crying in the club
Ever since i am following you on youtube, i never commented on any viedo (even tho i love your content) but man, this video made me cry tears of joy! Congrats to you cody, you are truly inspirational for me! Your energy is everything!
lmao at the fade down to the massage gun
This was actually such a beautiful thing to watch. Cody is an IRON MAN!!
Cody casually dropping a really slick micro-documentary. Much love from a Calgarian🔥   quick edit to give props to the filmmakers in the credits :)
Bro why am I crying 😭
I think technically energy is EVERYTHING tho.
This video was so inspirational! How is it that you can become so emotionally invested in a complete stranger and his journey! So much so that after I watched this I got online to see where the nearest Ironman would be to me and its actually in my town! Sacramento, Ca. But it's in October so registration is already closed. I was soo bummed out! As soon as registration opens up for 2024, I'm all in. Butttt... they have IronKids!! So I was able to register both my kids and one parent gets to run with each child. So I'll still get to run lol. I'll run the 1/2 mile with our 3 year old son and my husband will run the mile with our 8 year old daughter. Can't wait! Thanks so much Cody. You're frictionless dedication is really inspiring 😆
I’ve been in a rut in my life recently and this is so inspiring to get out there and accomplish something
Choo choo my man!
I can confirm Cody Ko is indeed a Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist
blah blah blah where's the cut video
Move over Robert Downey Jr.
This was an awesome video brooo. Keep it pushing Cody ❤
super cool congrats!
I absolutely love how cinematic and professional this is. Congrats to not only to becoming an Ironman, but also for putting together such a great mini documentary!
his sister still did it before him
well done
I thought i was tweaking when i heard "Can You Hear the Music" from Oppenheimer in the video
Cody's editor has excellent taste in music. Everything Everywhere all at Once and Oppenheimer. I believe the first one was from Moneyball. I watched the whole video just to have a music orgasm
Absolute legend
You and Kelsey need to stop making me feel things!!
"WE ASCEND TOGETHER" Keep it up Cody, your a huge inspiration.
Cody trains - theory can only take you so far
I love this video.
seeing you change so much throughout the years has been amazing, and no change was ever bad. i have mad respect for you cody and i wish you and kelsey and your baby love and happiness and a great lifetime together
Omg I just realized how much happened in the last year :00 congrats on everything!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉 energy truly is everything
10:02 why does the Oppenheimer music fit so well lol
so proud of you cody
This is such a weird format for a Cody Ko video but amazing job man!
that was amazing
This is incredible.
My brother sister and dad are all Ironman, I feel the mockery of them as well lmao. Doing my first half Ironman in May - Victoria. Keep it up Cody me and my girlfriend have been watching you for years and it’s crazy to see what you have accomplished. Hope to meet you some day.
Funny how you'll still be remembered as the white that's cringe guy.
I, a grown ass man teared up watching another grown ass man run. Fantastic film.
What a video. 10/10
9:56 knock on wood jeez. this shit took me out
Choo, choo!!!
Praying for you bro, Ik your all about purpose and doing good. I feel God is doing work in you and you don’t even know it. I pray you come to Jesus it’s more than a stupid corny religion. I think you will find that all you have done had been for the glory of God. 🙏🙏🙏
Do the double iron man
Cody stop I did not plan on crying today
Eating this while watching Fritos, I hate Fritos but it’s the only thing my broke ass had to eat atm.
This was wonderful.
oppenheimer and social network music, very nice.
This gave me goosebumps bro.. truly inspiring your work and dedication to follow your parents.. Bravo cody!!
that sloppenheimer soundtrack
I’m so glad that cody was able to put aside his cocaine addiction to train for his ironman
idk if i’m empathetic or just chronically online but this shit made me cry fr 🥺 i’m so proud of cody
cody you're an inspiration my dude, glad to have such a positive rolemodel in today's sea of madness
Cody the new David Goggins
I rarely comment on videos but holy moly cody. This is an incredible video.
All the Cody Trains vlogs coming in clutch 🔥
Damn this video is so wholesome & inspiring can be watched as a pre workout video.
Beautiful day at the end got me a little 🥲
ITS HEREEEE🎉🎉🎉🎉
Actually very emotional watching this, been watching Cody for years and he’s changed so much. A lot of mental and physical demand to do something like this.  Well done Cody 💙
Little Cody is so adorableeee
The old clips of Cody nearly brought me to tears
Anyone else get emotional???
4:18 milf manor call back
What an inspirational, frictionless, flirty young man
where's your red ironman suit then 😹?? am i right guys?😹😹 guys?
Inspiring Cody.
8:33 I would have done the same 🤣
Top!
The Social Network score 🔥🔥🔥
the oppenheimer music really ties it together
congratulations cody
Legendary.
Oppenheimer music goes nutty
logan paul ahh video
Dude is just winning in life lately
So proud of you Cody!! You’re a good man
AND Cody & Kelsey found out she was pregnant like a few days before the race!! wtf craziness
He’s going to be the best dad ever
ironman is on my list of things to do
Absolutely beautiful video Cody and team. Brought tears to my eyes and plenty of laughs. :)
So proud of you man!
My man became Dre Drexler respect 🫡
Nice of the event organizers to use your birth year as your number. Its always good to humor the elderly.
Missed opportunity to Robert Downey Junior the title and thumbnail
As someone with a young son I can totally relate to wanting to share life achievements like this, both yours and his, with each other, and how good that feels. This was really emotional and well done.
Cody you’ve inspired me so much with this series and watching you helped me to get motivated to start running. I was diagnosed with heart failure in 2020 and gained almost 100 pounds from having to be sedentary and all the medications and surgery. Today I’ve lost 70 pounds and run almost every single day and I love it. I’m getting my health and my life back and it all started with the motivation from you man. I hope you see this and know how much of an impact you’ve made on my life. Energy is everything!!
Im crying
loved following this journey. you have motivated me in so many ways. such an awesome vid
Had a Pavlovian response to the Oppenheimer music and started wondering when he’d be in Los Alamos
just sobbed…. congrats cody!! you inspire so many 🥹🤍
Cody you inspired me to start running, ever since i saw your interview with Jeff, aswell as your videos on cody trains, i have been hooked. You're such a nice guy, and i wish to become a ironman just like you someday.
Your parents also doing the ironman to support you while they could have cheered from the sidelines ♥️ family goals
Thank you for uploading this. I don’t watch your other channel, because I simply don’t watch training channels. I guess I find it a bit confronting. Seeing this was actually inspirational! You’ve made me sign up for 21km trail run 😄 really, thank you!
You’re a lucky man to have so much love and support from your wife, parents, sister, and millions of fans. Incredible job, Cody. You made it 👏🏼🎉
didn't think I'd be crying to a Cody Ko video today
My dude joined the Avengers. Good for Cody.
So inspiring bro! Congrats on this big achievement!
Choo choo mfers
Choo Choo! Gaur Cordy!
Why am I CRYING RN !?! Congratulations 👏🎉👏 becoming an Ironman and a father !!!!!!!!
ok i cried if that's what you wanted
This probably sounds super silly from a total stranger, but GD I am proud of you man. Good job! You're an inspiration for sure.
the oppenheimer music😂 legend editing
Man as somebody who edits a lot, I KNOW finding those clips of you as a kid and seeing all those parallels must’ve felt so dang good
he did all this while finding out he was becoming a father right before leaving for australia
this was amazing
Didn't expect the Oppenheimer theme but it fits perfectly
this literally made me tear up. thank you for bringing us along for the ride. badoats forever<3
Now I gotta start training! Thanks alot man
So when is the family channel coming out?😂
i am currently training for a "tough mudder" obstacle curse thing and i dont reaaaally know what im doing but this was pretty inspiring! Thank you Cody! Awesome job!
Knee issues😅 Cody is getting old
Congratulations, Cody! This video is incredibly inspiring! I'm going to run a little further today, and the days moving forward. Cheers.
good job man
Gor Cordy!
Am I the only one tearing up?
The production value on this one was insane good fucking job to everyone who worked on this video 👍🏻
The Oppenheimer soundtrack on race day, perfect.
Currently training for my first iron man the “nehhhhhhh” of the espresso machine made me emotional. Great work king
You inspired me cody to do a marathon. I'm gonna start right now........... I mean tomorrow
Why did I cry 😂 That was such a cute and funny video
I didn't expect to cry wtf
GAUR COURDYYYY
ahhh this has me in tears🥹
That's actually sick. Live it up my dude, you're living your best life!
Its easy to tell who's an ironman      because they'll tell you
CORDY KOLO...DDD...ZI..CHEEK! Hahahaha the name at the finish line ALWAYS gets me. Congrats Cody! What a cool vid!
The train ❤️❤️❤️
Cody is so insanely dedicated and he got this shit DONE. HE DID IT. That is so impressive man. Props to you.
Cody is so insanely dedicated and he got this shit DONE. HE DID IT. That is so impressive man. Props to you.
This was such a lovely video :)
Oppenheimer sound track goes hard here
Putting the Oppenheimer theme in there just elevates this to another level lol. Congrats man! I love how you carry yourself with humor, but with also so much heart. This is awesome!
I see you with the Oppenheimer soundtrack haha. Amazing work Cody!!!
Using the Oppenheimer soundtrack was awesome
Was not expecting to cry. Thanks. Lol.
Everybody’s always saying Cody’s such a bum Cody’s this Cody’s that…I’m Cody bro. Let me be me!!!!
Proud of Cody, but this is worthy of a that’s cringe ep
This was beautiful you did such a good job  Someone was cutting onions when you finished
It’s so cool to see people like Cody who make goofy shit all the time just do something 100% earnest and raw. Never saw something with this level of vulnerability and production value coming from the guy who makes Button videos, but I love it.
yo that Oppenheimer score slaps
Hearing Cody say he hopes he can be there for someone the same way his parents were there for him after announcing his son is so sweet I cant stand it 🥺😭
This is so amazing. The fact that you can feel how much Cody cares about Ironman through this video is really something special. As well as the splicing together childhood memories. This is the truest form of art and it truly is admirable. Congratulations Cody on being an Ironman and a father (you have to say I love you 3000 to your children now). Thank you for the time & care you put into this video. Big up Cody, Austin, Matt, Thomas, Brooke, Dan and all others who worked on this for making this come to life!
Cody I sense you are having a major evolution of character, less frat boy more wholesome dad and it’s awesome man
the family home videos of Cody as a kid and his dad’s ultra Canadian, “Cody can ride it without training wheels now ya know?”
Doing the Italian Iron Man in 2025 and it’s all because of Cody! I can’t wait to see where training takes me.
this made me so happy omg
Proud of you Cody
I think if I ran that far in one go I’d never do more than a brisk walk for the rest of my life 😂 this is crazy impressive
I still dont know how to swim but i hope to do a iron man and triathlon in the near future! Gotta take some lessons
this genuinely made me tear up. i'm so happy & proud of cody
not the oppenheimer music😂
This made me laugh and cry happy tears
I'm not supposed to be this verklempt watching a damn CODY "IRONMAN" KO video 😭🥰😭🥰 now my entire equilibrium is tainted (heh), up is down, dogs & cats marrying each other what is happening
Why am I crying. Choo choo
I loved this.
A family of Ironmans is truly impressive
this made me tear up watching... cody you should feel SO proud of yourself for putting in the work and dedication into all of this!!!! not only is it about the physical ability to keep up and keep going, but its a whole mental game too. SO proud of you and happy for all the things you've accomplished!!! your son will have the coolest parents! ❤
this was so beautiful, great job to cody and everyone on the team. this video was so inspirational, wholesome and just so amazing
really good video chodester!!
f$%&NG Beautiful
From That's Cringe to being an Ironman. What a character arc. Congrats Cody!
i’ve never been more proud of someone i’ve never met.
Was so amazing to watch this journey the past year! 💗 Cody Trains has been so motivating for me.
Oppenheimer
This was adorable and inspirational!! 10/10 ❤❤❤
This is why I love Cody so much. I've been watching him since the beginning and seeing how far he has come as a man makes me want to strive for so much more. Cody, thank you for showing me that anything is possible, you are more than your setbacks, your frustrations, your rocky roads. You are exactly who you need to be for yourself in all stages of life, thank you for everything🤍
Cody never fails to make me cry when he shares anything about his fitness or his family. So much love for you dude!
❤
Oppenheimer music goes fire.
god i love this man
Amazing! you inspire to keep on training and following my goals so keep on chooing!
Beautiful video. Cody, thank you for inspiration. One day, I will also be an ironman.
crying, such a great journey, so proud of the Ko family!
cody really out here making movies now
One of the best YouTubers of our time, Cody is a role model and hilarious. His support system with Kelsey and his family is so admirable
I love this documentary style of content, love to see it in the future
not me literally crying at the end! So proud of you CODY!
Fucking crying at that ending too, so beautiful....im gonna be an iron man one day, so inspiring
Why am i crying
The cuts to the slow mo massage gun were hilarious. Nice touch
This is the sweetest freaking video and just amazing oh my gosh
You won the cool/ loving/ supportive parents lottery.
I freaking love the use of "Can You Hear The Music" from Oppenheimer. It fit it so well.
Gaur Caurdy!!
“You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain”  Never thought cody would upload something so Dre dexler like that. But props to him actually i am glad he is happy :)
Oppenheimer music was a great fit
here i am being sad that i dont have the willpower and self discipline to do anything like this... also sad because damn.. people actually remember things from before they were ten? trauma got me good
This is huge!!!
I still can’t get over the fact Cody thinks he got sick in Vegas when like 2 days before he was running and got caught in a crazy rainstorm far from home, he said it’s the coldest he’s ever been. Still what an amazing feat, what a lovely family and support system he has. Congratulations!
not me CRYING
LFG CODY!!!!!!
Ok Cody with the Netflix documentary this came out really good I love this style I kno it overly used but still it’s really good and congrats on the Ironman NOT a walk in the park for sure mentally or physically Edit: Cody please tell me u finished before you parents loo
we are all proud of you Cody.  much love to you and Kelsey, congrats on your baby boy on the way!!
My dumbass thought he meant the marvel superhero 💀(well done tho)
Incredible
Huge congratulations, not just on the Ironman, but the wedding, being able to do it with your family, everything. Not a lot of people can do what you’ve done.
Not Cody using the Oppenheimer soundtrack
12:10
WODY. W CODY.
Never though I’ll get emotional over a Cody ko video
Cody, you have gone from my favorite viner, to my favorite youtuber, and now my biggest fitness inspiration. It has been so sick seeing your life change and you finding your passions. Congratulations on everything!!!!!!!
amazing video! so happy for you
Dude used the fucking The Social Media movie montage song for his own montage what a legend
is that oppenheimer music?
the production on this video is crazy!
Training for my first marathon right now and Cody was my first inspo....it really is ups and downs...lets fkn go
the commitment, hard work and dedication its takes to fight thru physical stamina and mental barriers to complete an ironman race are absolutely no joke, especially for a  63 year old man cody you're an inspiration!
This whole thing reminded me of surfs up I love it 🐧
Congrats on the finish! Loved watching your training on Cody Trains! Choo choo!
oppenheimer music in the background, great choice.
love the "can you hear the music" choice for race day
do a cum man next
Incredible last couple of hours. First the trail video on Cody Trains now THIS! Love it
I am inspired to do an ironmain as soon as a can. I started running but learned I have some weird leg issue but once that's sorted... IRONMAN!
love you cody youre awesome
This really touched my heart.
Damn, it is absolutely insane what the human body can do. This was the perfect amount of silly and inspirational. I was tearing up at the end and I usually do not at inspirational sports videos. Proud of you Cody!
8:09 no titelcard?!
Cody pretending he meant “Coca Cola” Right
In your childhood videos your dad sounds sooo Canadian
This is so well done 👏🏻🚂
opeengheimer music so good
I cried 😭😭😭
6:03
i was so fucking proud of you when you finished the iron man, i followed your whole journey with it
I have never laughed and teared up so much in the span of 13 minutes🥲
Look at Mr. Struggle go! 😆
This made me emotional. A fantastic short documentary. Gripping story, impeccable editing, great home movie footage. Everything came together for this one man, you should submit this to a film festival or something.
Congratulations!!! 🎉🍾
What an amazing mini-doc.  Congrats cody, watching the way your whole family came together is very wholsome!
yoo a full on documentary on how cool you are. nice vids
man yall got the social network music
no way he used can you hear the music for this 😭
I want the same energy and documentary for when Kelsey gives birth cuz that’s a marathon in itself
this is so beautiful, congratulations Cody. What a wonderful gift you gave to yourself ❤
Fuck yes cody
Congratulations! Finishing the Ironman is such an impressive accomplishment!   I've never done it, but I've been to a few to help out friends, and there's something I find interesting about stuff like this. Hearing what an Ironman includes sounds difficult and impressive. But actually, seeing what an Ironman includes and watching the athletes do it in person makes you really appreciate the incredible endurance and mental strength finishing a race like this takes. I have to imagine that appreciation turns into a fundamental understanding, as soon as an athlete really starts training to do it.   Sorry for the long-ass comment! But congratulations again!
The vhs tape❤😭
This video is everything
very inspiring
The Oppenheimer ost goes crazy
Gay
This is amazing! Thanks for inspiring us all
Cody ur awesome
I wish this was ten times longer, would honestly watch a full length doc. Loved it.

I love the Oppenheimer style Ironman run, with the popcorn and the music and the dramatic looking off into the distance. 🤌

obligatory “bro think he tony stark” joke, “bro thinks he’s in the avengers”,  “bro thought he got thanos”, etc.  on a serious note, i’m very proud of you and i also have a piece of clothing that feels like it gives me superpowers. but i don’t wanna make this about me. CONGRATS CODY!!!!! energy really is everything

Don’t get me wrong, completing an ironman is an incredibly impressive achievement, but after years of constant bits I can’t take Cody seriously at all lmao
I’m not into Cody trains at all but this is making me want to cry :,) happy tears tho
This was genuinely one of the most inspiring videos Cody, congratulations!!!
Ludwig seething

Congratulations Cody 🎉
ENERGY IS EVERYTHING
I’ve always had this as a goal and this is very motivating so thank you💪🏼
WE ASCEND TOGETHER!
Congrats man ENERGY IS EVERYTHING
Absolutely cannot believe how far you've come man. To think I saw you a few years back reacting to MattySmokes and now you're married, having a kid, and fulfilling your goals. What a beautiful and inspiring story dude.
Cody, what an awesome video. Congrats on your achievements! I’ve been following Cody Trains and it’s awesome to see the progress you’ve made.  This video definitely made me a little emotional!
i need a full cody ko documentary now
Cody was there for his dads first Ironman and now Cody’s son was there for his first Ironman
So well put together, well done Cody
soo proud of you. You're going to become the best dad.
This is giving Surf’s Up

Haha that's nice Cody, when is the next let's cringe?
Yeah man your killing life lol. Dope as hell

crying so hard at Cody wanting to be the example for his son someday 😭😭😭
Where's the suit and armour??
CHOO CHOO so inspiring Cody!
I love the inclusion of Oppenheimer music in this
Fucking choo choo!!
you know what? energy is EVERYTHING!!!
ENERGY IS EVERYTHING
I wanna do one now
Watching Cody’s journey inspired me to start hitting the gym
sucha fucking dude
HUGE
GAUR CAURDYYYYY
Damn this is cheesy, and I love it
A Cody Ko video is the last place I expected to hear Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score from the Social Network, but it somehow made this video even better.
goddamn this made me emotional
Such a feel good story! Thank you for this. I needed this today. I’m so happy for y’all! A constant inspiration!! Congrats 🎉
Ok fuck Cody the film guy now
livin frictionless
One of the most frictionless men in the ironman game. Truly inspirational
Really serendipitous that I’m wearing my cody trains merch at the gym when this dropped
This actually has me tearing up 💗
This is absolutely fantastic and so motivating!
This is beautifully done, interweaving the family footage in to parallel with the struggles faced was neat.
TIL
1k like woooo
THE LITTLE BABY CODY SHOTS ARE KILLING ME 😭😭💗💗
I'm speechless... just beautiful
I remember being six years old and running the final quarter mile with my dad as he finished his Ironman in Phoenix. The picture of him and I crossing the finish line together, little kid having fun and completely exhausted dad smiling bigger than he ever has, hangs on my wall and has for over 15 years. Your ultramarathon video really got me going, as I had run my first marathon a year before that video came out. I was looking for the next thing. Recently trashed my knee and I’m starting to come back. Watching a comedian that I’ve been watching since the Vine days blossom into one of my favorite YouTubers AND have the crazy tenacity that it takes to exercise on an elite level is incredibly inspirational. Thank you. Never stop. Energy is everything
Gotta love the kind of role model Cody has been and is growing to become. Short King Energy fr
Love the social network soundtrack usage  Edit: and OPPENHEIMER
wait why am i crying lol
I normally cry hearing "It's a Beautiful Day" because my dad raised me with his love for U2, so this had me bawling in an instant. Your family is just lovely, and you are incredible Cody! Might be weird because parasocial relationships are weird, but we're all super proud of you.
Cody, don't eat off the floor on camera...
This stuff is so inspiring! Thank you for sharing Cody!
so glad to see you living up to robert downey jr's legacy!
I feel like i should have paid for this
Why am I just finding out that Cody's parents are insanely fit lmao...this is amazing!!!
Oh i been waiting for this one
it is so funny to me that the whole thing started because he didnt wanna be one upped by his sister but fr im so proud of cody like hes really achieved so many great things
That was beautiful 🥰🥰🥰congratulations Cody
incredibly inspiring!! choo choo!!
This was insanely well made, it actually got me tearing up. GAUR CORDY!!
🥲🥲🥲
LETS GO CODY! ENERGY IS EVERYTHING!
the stairmaster was an unpaid actor here
all jokes aside this is really cool
Insane video Cody!! That shit was genuinely just incredibly well made and so personal, loved it
Choo choo 🚂
Amazing
what a beautiful video. i love his reaction videos but this is such a beautiful production into cody’s life. amazing vid as always cody!
We are so proud to be Choochies. So proud Cody!!
Congratulations Iron Man Ko!
SO PROUD
this dude doesnt even burn..
epic
Wow that’s a very touching ending
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, CODY!!!!
The home videos 😭
I thought this video was going to be about OSRS
Got chills when Can You Hear the Music started playing fr
love the oppenheimer / social network (?) music
I’ve only been watching for 1 minute and I already love this NICE JOB CODY!!!!!! ❤🎉
No way he put the fucking Oppenheimer theme
okay oppenheimer score
I like seeing this content. In commentary a lot of it is just reactionary and even though its awesome with this youre really creating your own thing. Great video!
I’m so happy that you are so proud of yourself, and the hard work you’ve put into your work AND your family (existing & future) Time to Choo Choo in the Circle with Chodsters 😭🫶🏼
WE ASCEND TOGETHER!!!
WE ASCEND TOGETHER
so proud
heyyy
IRONDAD!!!!!
I'm from Bolton where the UK Ironman takes place, the landscape is a beautiful place to cycle in, the finish line in front of the beautiful Town Hall and Le Mans Cescent, is a great finish for the race. Howevee, I imagine the hills are horrible. It's funny about week before hand you see so many people around training for it, with people swimming in lakes and resavouirs and cyclists flying down hills at full speed, faster than the cars. It would be amazing to see Cody come to the UK one as well.
Damn I didnt know a single hat can have both black and green stitching. Does it change with warm water
Whoever curated the soundtrack to this popped off. The Social Network, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Oppenheimer. Unreal.
I love how serious edited this all is compared to all the lovely cute vlogs on cody trains
Cody has really done the damn thing. Congratulations Cody! We’re so proud of how far you’ve come!
I love this so much
Was waiting for this 😤😤
I had no idea how personal Ironman was to Cody, he basically grew up with it. His dedication for it makes so much sense and its so wholesome, congrats to Cody!
As someone who cycles competitively, MAJOR kudos on that first 12 weeks. And coming back from injury!!!
cody is so much stronger than i’ll ever be
Cody has just been winning in life recently. I mean getting married, becoming a dad and now becoming an Ironman. You gotta really appreciate how far he has come
let’s go codddyyy!
WE LOVE YOU CORDY
Hi

Ironman before becoming Iron Dad

Nigga talk about the day you became a dad god damn it. That's what we want to hear about 😭😭
