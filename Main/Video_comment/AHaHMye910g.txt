Check out my latest second channel upload: https://youtu.be/8rrcEp_lUGo
I remember watching hackers doing this first season and here we are 19 seasons later.. the state of competitive multiplayer gaming is frustrating to say the least
I killed this kid 15 times in control last week
I don't think the first one is a cheat lol
Pff hope you reportes
Let’s be honest that looks hella fun just imagine your 1v1 another squad and a third party with 2 dudes flying and landing near you
How the hell does easyanticheat system miss these people and dont just insta ban them???
Why even play?
pov: botw
That reminds me of those vanossgaming clips where they build momentum on the person who is it in hide and seek and then when they get released they just fly across the map
Best gaming chair
I ran into a random Bangalore on King's Canyon, she kept throwing her ultimate at me one after another before I killed her. I'm not sure if that was some sort of bug or glitch, or if it was just a hack :/
at this point it got to be the devs cheating trying piss people off there so many and they don't stop it lol
That reminds me of the old loot bin octane pad glitch
The punch fly hack kinda reminds me of the glitch where you punch the top of an opened supply box than jump on it
after seeing the guy literally floating through the air you think infinite armor swaps will surprise me?😂😂😂
Bangs new passive is kinda busted
This be a jojo reference
What about the people that on apex are doing the cheaters got a new cheat they dont fucking die bro is one shot me shoots a head shot bro still lives on ik that this has to be some form of cheating if its not impossible aim its the no hp gone in fights its madenning
I seen this one time but they sucked at cheating so I ran up on them and killed them
And this is why the game is dying. Because losers who couldnt succeed or win anything in life mist cheat to feel good about themselves.
This isn't cheats its just a player who is trying to go to his dad
I think it's more of a bug than a cheat
I’ve never came across a cheater that I knew was cheating
POV the new revenant
Its lofi
Did yall know that's on the hub don't ask how I know😏😏😏
They always can stop in mid air , and this flying thing works the same as bug which was allowing you to launch you from crates
nono thats a glitch
He's beginning to believe 😮
He wasn’t aimbotting he was using the smart pistol from titanfall2
9 4
I remember one stand from 5th JoJo
Hence why I don’t play any cheater infested games
These kids never played halo 2 and it shows
This is actually a glitch in the game. No I'm not joking I've seen a vid3o on this before.
First seconds he just had the smart pistol and then He used his veryyyyy good gaming chair
reminds me of the earlier seasons where you could punch the loot box and load up a super jump. Very similar.
Bs and he’s not banned 🤦🏾
What platform are y'all even on to be getting cheaters because I play on Xbox and there's no cheaters?
You can do the launch thing without cheats
Bro's a stand user
I love game hackers 😂 adding spicy flavor to all their lobbies, it’s always hilarious to walk across even if it means getting kinda fucked atm
EA doesn't even care about anything. They just don't care about player community. 1st. This game's inventory display & UI is the most boring one I have ever seen in any game. 2nd. Looting system & inventory system is so broken in this game. This game doesn't even show how much nades or equipments you are carrying anywhere on side. You will always have to open inventory to check & remember what items you are carrying. At time of looting death box also there is no mini display for your inventory. There should be option to show on side seperately "how much separate types of ordinance you are carrying & healing items " so that i dont have to open my bag/ healing/ nade option to see how much I should loot n what to loot.
Mf I am gonna go creative mode
He just has a better gaming chair
I get ddossed by people I dismantle.
POV: TASKMAST33R
imagine that launch with the wraith ult😭
He’s not aimbotting, respawn Finlay added the smart pistol
bro became link with that stasis
That floating thing is old. I use to see octanes take jump pad, float , and charge rifle everyone with their auto aim
Game keeps getting crazier and crazier 💀
Bros in a mw2 prestige lobby
Im not gonna lie, this cheat with horizon would be so fun
Bros using the breathe of the wild sorta mechanic
The flying thing might be a glitch where you keep your game a window mode and you right click the white board on the window and it stops your game
BOTW status rune
Average controller player in apex
At first I thought you were playing and I staid my boy you cheating right now
Gaming merchant said the exact same thing The exact same way on the exact same clip
I guarantee you if you make a brand new account and play a couple matches you'll find one or two cheaters like I'm pretty sure I play with one cause bro dropped a 26 bomb and 4k dmg and then I died to a pathfinder in another match with 15 kills and 3k dmg
He recreated the supply bin flying glitch from like season 1. That’s pretty sick
Bro add zelda ability in apex
It’s crazy people actually have fun doing this
Aim bot 6th time Shield swap 2nd time Flying hack 1st
One time I came across a hacker who made me and my friends game lag hard as shit(my internet was fine 2 seconds before the encounter). In my next game my internet was normal.
nah bro aint cheating he just got a better gaming chair
I died to a kid with ambot and watch him obliterate the whole lobby and it was so sad he was level 6 and was so bad at the game. Safe to say his aim won the game for him. I was really hoping the last team would kill him and they got him to literally 1hp and died instantly 😭.
Hol on a sec imma just fly
That’s just a good gaming chair
Insane aimbot and wallhack, shows a clip of him missing half his shots
There was a exploiter In my match he didn’t use aimbot but he flew in the are and just shot us
Lol this is a normal game in apex mobile
Dudes like legend of zelda
broo the thing with flying that so smart. it's not a cheat also btw
Would b fun a game or fire range the punch one tho
Bro has stasis from botw 💀
That’s stasis from zelda
bros got the smart pistol
Wundersphere lmfao
Never played the game tbh
dies to return to battle 💀
Nah man, they just put the smart pistol from titan fall into apex.
The freeze reminds me of right clicking outta Minecraft using whitebar at top
dude is still pissed off about them taking out the lootbin launch glitch
It’s like that one Minecraft exploit where you can press f11 then press the task bar and you freeze, and you can go flying
He ate the slow slow fruit
I'm glad I play on console
Nah he just really good
only valid way to cheat in Apex is to run the RE45Auto with aimbot because it had aimbot in OG Titanfall
Yes we all have seen these
Man's in creative
Huh guess airstuck in csgo could of been a way more interesting cheat if there was a way to build momentum
His teammate used statis on him and did the launch glitch lmao
Lore accurate re45
I just think its the re auto
He’s not cheating 😂
Cs 1.6 has a similar exploit where you can freeze your game while middair and someone else  can stack explosions to make you gain speed
He isnt cheating he just got the Titanfall 2 Smart pistol
These are devs goofing around.
He just has a good gaming chair bro🤓
I would personally want a mod to make turn into a rocket
The launch is just a glich
I swear you could do that flying thing with a supply bin in like season one
Ok this is a sorce engine things because in like gmod and things other games that use it you can build up momentum then it sends you flying so like b hops in csgo or trimping in tf2.
First for me
Same glitch from legend of zelda.
The box swap is just swap spawn item.
The jump is known as hulk jump
Floating also known as hover hack
Na man he ain’t cheating he is just a really good player
The cheat obviously freezes his position, you can punch teammates to knock them back, thus with each hit more and more momentum is gained, I assume it’s some kind of self lag switch.
Alright I think I know what's happening you can do the same in Minecraft They're not having their probably just freezing the tab And the teammate is building up momentum by punching him
Hes defo got a ping abuse along with a lag switch, even more of cringe..
Yo, that’s Zelda
Man what in the gta v are these hacks dawg
Another weird one I’ve ran into a few times where if a cheater with this cheat on gets shot everyone in the lobbies ammo just disappears
Bro literally has kraftwerk
You can use your brain to cheat but not to get better
His "float" seems to be a hack that just freezes his location. He flies from his teammate punching by building up momentum, because being punched pushes you back a bit. Smart
Bro don't tell me that he is playing  legend of zelda
bro pulled breath of the wild physics
Hes not cheating hes using smart pistol  And titanfall eject with minimap reveal
That’s some Zelda flying techniques lol
"it's not hacks it's the Titanfall smart pistol."
That is just nice to see
this is a bug u need to press on the white screen above your game when you jumped
Stasis at 3AM💀
I feel like the second one is just like links time stop hit chain to launch something
He’s just better
Ngl I saw this exact guy i died to him
OMG all the OG season 1 players will recognize  he turned himself into a supply bin and flew like the good old days.
I would be too flabbergasted to report
The first cheat is actually him disconnecting for a moment and for some reason the punches are insane. Non cheaters can do this aswell but it's useless because they can't come back straight away like the cheater can
Cheets from ohio
This dude ain’t hacking, he’s just good
Bro had the smart pistol💀
Imagine thinking this is cheating
I’ve seen the punch flying before, the person is simply freezing their game (I think) but the velocity still builds up with each punch, therefore growing to 4000+ to shoot him waaayyyy up in the air!
that cheat is called last cheat and they get banned with in 2-3 games
I saw a level 25 Bloodhound that had a Pred badge in Arenas once. Not sure if he got it from playing ranked or from an Unlock Tool, but either way, he was Using aimbot and Walls for sure so. But other than that not really. I always find Cheaters a bit Scarce in Apex and Fortnite. Warzone 2 as well surprising enough. It really took them Three years and a New Game to make an anti cheat that functions like an Anticheat and not a troll machine.
This is funny asf But if you seriously rely on cheats to win, you are an insolent buttmunch
Bro ain't cheating he has a smart pistol
Just a really good gaming chair.
Bros gaming chair is amazing
What's the name of the song from the first half of the video?
What’s that song played in the background of the first aerospace launch
Far as I can tell that’s not a cheat. On some servers if you hold your mouse over your window bar on the top while jumping in the air you will just float and do exactly as that glitch lets you do. I’ve done it a bunch in crab game and I’m no hacker. He did use aim bot tho lol.
That's like the freaking stasis mode they have in breath of the wild
Yeah cheating is bad but ngl sometimes can be entertaining. Just enjoyable to watch
What do you mean this is the beta test for Bangalore ult buff
When ur a valk main and the first guy goes for her
Hes got Breath of the Wild Stasis
He’s not cheating, he’s just using the smart pistol from titanfall 💀
he isn't hacking, he just knows how to freeze in midair, shoot people that hes not even looking at, loot death boxes really fast.
never even seen a cheater ヾ(≧▽≦*)o
There are people in tik tok who are streaming apex using cheats(found 5 people doing that in a span of 1 hour)
So the flying through the air isn’t a cheat you can do it with just about any pc or laptop and what it pretty much does is stops your game without completely turning it off if that makes any since but pretty much anything that happens while you do that will take affect after you un do it so that’s why his teammate is punching him a bunch
THAT WHEN HEE FREEZED THE CHEAT WAS CALLED LAG AIR
That punch one where he floats is actually quite easy to do
Wdym he just pressed spacebar rly hard
Hacks? No that's just the smart pistol from Titan fall
Saw a mirage early tonight 2/25/23 that jumped off an octane pad and kept boosting in mid air to go super far.
Least obvious Bangalore main
Nah I feel like this is ripped from tgm
Meanwhile in roblox...
The first one is not a hack if you press tab then your screen stop and if someone punches you when you are back in the tab it sends you flying
Yesterday i saw a bang with wallhacks and aimbot,I'll never understand why would you even want to play videogames if you are missing the purpose and the challenge of it.
Nah that pathfinder is on some breath of the wild type shit
He just has the better gaming chair
No bro hes using the smart pistol
Why does the flying move remind me of the move from zelda breath of the wild
the 45 and 301 was ridiculous
i thas somethings call laser pen that cheat can make you  flow in air and stop in mid and laser them
Yeah breath of the wild
he got the Breath of the Wild hacks😆thats some stasis lock mechanics
my enemies in ranked be like
Skill issue
Fun fact the fly across the map is not a hack, its a bug that is now fixed.
The first one was just best player to ever hip fire a RE-45, shit I can't hit a single headshot hip-fire so I can't hate him for every bullet being one. The second one is just simply The Stasis DLC from BOTW collaboration. It's a switch exclusive obviously.
Man’s really doing breath of the wild stasis
Bro is playing legend of Zelda breath of the wild
It was just aim assist
The fly cheat probably works because it like stops his momentum/freezes him in place and his teammate hitting him build up momentum which stays until he unfreezes which launches him
xedctfvgbnhjuimhyugtfrde6tfr7ghyujjjjhygtfrrgtrerfdedtgyhujjjjjuujhy777777777
jayttttt
The punch momentum cheat literally is just like breath of the wild stasis 😭😭
He’s using statis from botw
Bro, enter creative mode🤣🤣😂😂
The floating in air cheat thing exists in csgo, when I asked what it was the guy said it was something to do with fake lag (take this with a grain of salt because I have no idea xD)
Man's doing Botw physics in Apex
that thing were he fly's across the map is not a cheat...
My guy play TitanFall 2 in the first clip💀
Switching Shields immediately is having very very well Mouse control and the other is clicking up to the top freezing you in the air so your teammate will fling you all the way up and actually fly whenever you exit out of it
His in Zelda botw
The second one the shield swap a path in my game had that
That man was not cheating. He was abusing a bug in many video games where you can set the tick speed of your game to 0/0 and freeze your game and character. You're still responding and in game so it doesn't dc you, but stats like momentum, knockback, speed, healing, etc., Don't apply until you reset your tick to 60/1 or whatever it was initially, then all the stats and effects carry out in-game in the order that your PC received them.
He’s not cheating he just has a really good gaming chair 🤦
The only one that would be funny is the launching cheat
Reminiscent of halo      oh my God the nightmares
Why you pretending this is a random encounter?
Man got stasis from breath of the wild
That’s some breath of the wild type stuff
Bro activated that shit from breath of the wild
I ran in to a cheater earlier that made is shields and health go up in one heal  And no it was not a phoenix kit
Bro is goky
You gotta admit sometimes they get creative 😂
I feel like he just unplugs his internet and then goes flying
He’s playing breath of the wild but in apex
Bro got either Craft work stand or a shieka slate
BRO you should play Taiwan server it painfully
Just played apex for the first time. First game, a 2000kill mad Maggie was in the bot lobby going for a 20kill 4k. He was at 16kills after wiping us, at 3100dmg. I'm on Xbox old gen. Hackers are everywhere even in bot lobbys
Omg those two are scum did u notice the pathfinder isn't hitting him for fun it's a team work effort to get the guy launched into the sky
Its very unique
Knockback pause is hella funny
You use to be able to do that launch glitch by just disconnecting you router and reconnecting it
It seems like he had taken the idea from Zelda breath of the wild
i ran into one today he did have the hit fly one tho the Armor one yes and he died with 19 kills and 3.8k damage XD
oooooo this is a hack.... i played a ranked arenas match with 2 guys that did this punching thing i honestly thought it was a bug
Long live season 0-1 and the loot bin x punch glitch. nobody remembers it.
Smart pistol
I ran into a cheater like this back in like season 4 when I first started playing
I think I saw you in my destiny lobby yesterday lmao
The cheat is literally Kraft work😭
He turned into a rock from Breath of the Wild.
Am i seeing the smart pistol?
I think the thing where he flies is possible without cheats. If you have your game windowed and right click the white bar on top i guess you might freeze. Used to work in some games
dud if i had that sky cheat i would mess with so many ppl.
Best gaming chair I’ve ever seen
The mega jump is left over coding from other games on the engine
I saw a wraith cheat she became invincible and when I turned my back she appeared and started shooting at me and the whole time she was standing in a corner where I was looking at the whole time. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Thats just the smart pistol from titan fall
Ah yes Ruining the game for everyone.
Those aren't cheats, they are just testing the new Jack Cooper legend with the smart pistol ult and the momentum tactical
There used to be a glitch with loot bins that did the same thing, most likely has something around that code area
Minecrft
That flying tec is not a hack it's a glitch unplug your internet when you jump into the air then have your teammate punch you and then reconnect to the  match
I think he’s doing is using the unruly, smart pistol
This uses one of the old game bugs you used to be able to fly across the map by doing that to loot bins
The punch cheat reminds me of the loot bin glitch.
Bro thinks he's link
I have seen Mande and many "pros" do an insta shield swap. Can't even see death box contents.. just get a new shield.
When ur so fkn bad at apex 😆
if you play mobile, this is common. shits like gmod creative xD
I have a partial answer to the fly 'hack'. It is an exploit that you use in minecraft as well by exiting then opening your tab. Hard to do but works. Only works on pc
Why play the game
Zelda botw stasis music plays
Mf noclipped 🤣
He freezes in the air than gets hit, he flies because he takes all the knock back
This is like the most common cheats you found at Apex mobile
I seen this in apex legends mobile :/
In apex mobile always seen a cheater like that
Bro just used stasis
There was a glitch all the way back in season 2 were if you punched a loot bin multiple times then jump on top it would send you flying. Only OGs remember
Not to be a nerd but the hack ge used is called silent aim not aim bot  most people get them confused All the time
Akimbo wingman better
That interstellar soundtrack in the background 😂
The thing where he freezes in the air is similar to a cheat that existed in csgo called air stuck but it functioned in a different way
Just seems like he has a better gaming chair to me
Classic case of someone rageing for fun
The flying is a lag switch, if you dc or lag mid air and a teammate punches you you go flying when you reconnect. It's a bug.
Skill issue tbh
If I had cheats like that I would so fuck with people
To infinity, and beyond💀
Man hacked apex to become breath of the wild link, I just have to respect it
Naw this mf playing breath of the wild
Bros playing Zelda botw
Bro those are not cheats. He is on controller.
When he’s floating he’s charging a hyper jump lol
How dare u hea not cheating he just got a good mouse pad
its just the smart pistol from titan fall2
Naw just has a good gaming setup
The waffle house has found its new host.
The friend punching th hacker is to heavily defy the speed limit in the game  by his friend punching him its adding extra speed to his player so when he unfreezes it all added at once launching him
The floating is one that in the hack injector someone found the old programming that allowed you to launch off a loot bin, but it's the player obviously. I want to date I have never used cheats but I have friends who like to mess with the code. It's fun to know scummy to use.
the stuck in the air is something called airstuck. it's also common in source games (considering apex was made in source) like tf2 and csgo.
Yeah that's a normal view in Blackshot during the good old days
I’ve seen people do the same thing on halo reach mcc they can move their character while they’re floating like a chess piece
that's called no clip
So he freezes himself and use cinetic energy to throw in the air ??
He’s not cheating he’s just got a good gaming chair
Called airstuck you used to be able to do it in csgo to spawn in the opponent’s spawn
The one we’re he stops in the are is not a hake
I've seen a lot of the instant shield swapping recently.
I'm more impressed rather than upset.
What are you talking about... there are no cheaters in apex legends... you're imagining stuff... (sarcasm) Fun fact: Respawn is doing nothing to prevent those... i mean even cheaters buy skins xD
Wish i had cheats to compete with them or its not fair
He is just to good
Hes not hacking hes just playing The legend of Zelda breath of the wild
"Our game doesn't have that bad of a hacking problem"
That’s some walking AC-130 type shit from MW2 😂
Seen this in black ops 2 too many times
Not a cheat actuallly, but a bug in the game. One has to jump in the air disconnect their wifi, and let their tm8 punch them, the momentum builds up, you reconnect and boom, your across the map
The fly thing its like the knockpack multiplyes
YESTERDAY I JUST GOT INTO A MATCH IN APEX MOBILE WITH A PLAYER WITH THE SAME HACKS, TOO GREAT BUT TOTALLY UNFAIR TO ALL OTHERS...
he just went in creative mode
I’d only use that freeze cheat just to fly around the map and not play the game
I have seen this. They instantly loot ammo too, when they run by a box.
I think the launch cheat would actually fun
the punch thing is actually a glitch if they close the game and there teammates punch them they gain momentum and they go back onto apex it sends them
It's the old infinit charge rifle + fly
Bro, we on mobile are facing a god, like fr, they can fly and kill everyone 💀💀
So this explains why when I crack shields, the fucker instantly shield swaps without physically standing next to a death box. Makes me just want to say fuck it and cheat too since I lose 95 out of 100 matches.
Maybe he I'd exploiting bugs
He downloaded apex in Ohio :V
https://youtu.be/iFxcpnGah0U
the second cheat reminds me of a glitch from season 2 where you punch a opened lootbin many times then climb up the loot box sends you flying.
Nah bro if i SEE that shit on occtane i'm logging off peace
I'm so glad I don't play on pc lol I'd lose my mind with cheaters
The launch isn’t a cheat it’s a glitch, you unplug your internet then tm8 punch u until it’s plugged back in and you get sent flying
It's like the stasis in botw. Is the building up of momentum built into the game and they just take advantage of it by freezing themselves? Its super interesting
The 1st hack that causes floating is a glitch that causes hilarious grapple issure for pathfinder
That hack is a fun that you can float and a teammate punch u u fly thats just a fun cheat I would use that for fun ngl
Thank God I'm on console.
Prob a WiFi glitch
It’s like the punching charges up knockback then when he unfreezes all that momentum makes him go flying
He just has a good gameing chair
I dont think the the flying mechanic is cheats, because u can do this in Minecraft as well. When u r like not in full screen and right click the bar that the minimise, close and enlarge buttons are located it freezes your game and since it is multiplayer u r frozen for everyone and the effects that the player is experiencing will not be displayed until he unfreezes his game which is done by left clicking the game screen.
Looks fun
Ive seen the deathbox one, the freeze in mid-air is also somewhat common when it comes to infinite charge rifle people... it's like just freezing yourself client side, you can actually do this by spam alt tabbing or more interesting you can use rivatuner and cap your fps at literally 1 and you will only move each frame so every 1 second
Listen he just has a good gaming chair
They've been around since s0. Fuck Hideouts and fuck Tufi.
I'm just lagging🙄
Quite sure the freeze glitch is not a hack. Basically any game with a knockback ability and windowed mode has this bug.
He has a good gaming chair
Nah I think he just got a good gaming chair
Btw the when he get stock in the air and get bunch for momentum is actually possible without hack it’s a DC bug that make u do that 😅
I’ve seen something similar to the punch thing, it was a glitch not cheats for me tho. My teammate disconnected from the match and we were punching him to zone and when he rejoined the punching didn’t move him for a few second and just stored up energy then eventually he just got launched
I saw that in tdm last week not the  shield swap but the launching thing some guy was just flying back and forth it was pretty funny cus he got stuck on the tower thingy in artillery
Just got apex yesterday and got 2 wins is that good? 😅
That's not a hack! His teammate used stasis on him and punched him til he's red for the biggest boost! Come on, man, you learn about this right at the beginning on the Great Plateau, pay more attention to the tutorial shrines duh...
I’m pretty sure the floating one might be a glitch
Bro implemented stasis lock from breath of the wild into apex
You know..when I first started Apex I had a random teammate ask me to do him a favor and punch him over and over while he stood on some elevation...me completely oblivious as to what was going on just did it cause I thought maybe it was just a bug or something he found...we won that game and he had a ton of damage and I remember wondering if he was a hacker... this was like a year ago I wonder if its the same guy.
the cheat is last cheat pro
The floating infinite charge rifle cheat was brutal. Absolutely destroyed us in high tiered lobbies. For those who don't know, the cheater floats in the air & uses a charge rifle to actually shoot you using aimbot. Any small angle, charge rifle hits you for 75 damage.
Battlefield player: ha
Wow
It's just storing momentum and releasing it at once
Using lastcheat
When I use to still play apex I never ever ran into a hacker and I played at launch. Do cheats exist on ps4/ps5? I've never ever met anyone using them. Either that or they're just really bad ig...
It’s like the old octane jump pad glitch
Good times
if you take out ethernet cable for 1 sec and while it's reconnection and get punch it sends you flying, it's pretty funny
I thing I was in that game
bro used catch the rainbow requiem
I hade a cheater with the annilotor pistol and almost killed him it was me and my squad vs him and he killed us
Y'all must not watch Aceu or Timmy lmaoo they have the soft versions of literally all of these.
Ohio Gaming chair
I helped program this last year. Glad guy finally got it running. Yall fucked now fuck apex.
Oh god good thing I’ve never seen something like this while playing:0
well, so many use the instant death box .. Look at all the pros. NO sound going into box and no delay . Go watch any so called "pro" game.
The punch launching reminds me of punching containers and launching when octane came out in s2
I don't know where you play but these hacks have been around in Asian servers for a long time now.
I don’t think that’s cheats. I think that’s that tag freezing thing.
Hope this game dies a fiery death and EA spends all the money they made on this one and they make another one and then that one fails. This game has brought me a lot of joy. But it has also brought me much pain and sadness and feelings of meaninglessness. The grind is never ending. The players, ever sweaty. Once you become masters in this game it just doesn't even fucking matter anymore you've already spent your entire soul and multiple years of your life for nothing. For more microtransactions. For a $500 heirloom. Because EA and Respawn "care". My fucking ass. All of them can die of cancer because that's what they are to the community of people who used to be gamers, but are now just another form of consumer.
I've seen the floating one before but the hackers were using charge rifles. Haven't seen the looting one tho
Nah bro he's just got a good gaming chair 💀💀
Why does it look like from your point of view
"So for todays glitch you kinda gotta do something like this"
It's like that Gibby arm shield and andnoctance jump pad bug :O wtf
Normal day in ohio
The flaot isnt cheating if u log out mid air and your teamate punches you the knock back stacks and shoots you when u log back in
Momentum freeze, when he undoes it, all the frozen Momentum adds up and launches him. Kinda genius
Cool😮
It's like gmod
It reminds me of the glitch people used to do with the supply boxes where you would punch the box which would store the knockback the melee caused until you jumped off of it. I remember dying to it because I simply flew too far lmao
That’s just lastcheat apex pro 😅
Loz botw stasis mode
I don’t want to meet that guy in a Trios game 💀
POV that's what M&K players see controller players.
bro who put stasis in apex?
The punch jump reminds me of me and my buddies punching pillboxes for like 2 min straight then getting on top and jumping then getting launched so far.
The punch boost thing isn’t a hack, its a bug. If you jump into the air and dc from internet while in the air a teammate can keep stacking punches, then when u reconnect you get all of the punches momentum at once
The flying thing is a glitch where you unplug your internet while your mid air and let a trámate punch you when you reconnect to the game your character goes flying thanks to the multiplied knock back
You are bad at Apex and you want to
That is not actually a cheat, it is a glitch where the player disconnects after jumping and all the momentum gained from the punches of his teamate happen at once. At least im pretty sure thats how it works i never tried it just saw a vid
The filing one is just a bug
Bro has the smart pistol
The floating one is a glitch, you disconnect your internet then have your teammates punch you. Then when you reconnect all the punch knockback will be stored and you'll go flying. It's still cheating and I'm pretty sure you can get banned for it.
the floating thing is actually a glitch, if you jump then disconnect your internet while your friend punches you, then reconnect, you fly really far for some reason
The aim hacks are real, but the flying isn’t. If you disconnect your internet in the air, the person can keep punching you. Then, once you turn your internet back on, the momentum from the punches will launch you
Noclip
you have a Video of his footage meaning thats you  = when ea finds outa perma ban
There's been a couple of times I'll shoot someone cracked their Shields and somehow they had shields again I wondered how and now I know
It’s not a cheat it’s a bug if a player disconnects in the air. Other ppl can punch him and launch him.
anticheat be like: nah thats completly legit
It's a glitch dc internet mid air have a friend punch many times then reconnect
The launching thing isn't him cheating that was a weird bug where you could launch your teammates, but the floating is probably cheating
😢can u tell me how u get such good quality on apex pc
That thing of looting being close to the box is not unique, I've seen it before a couple of seasons back
The flying thing is not a cheat you can actually do it, first: disconnect, second: jump while disconnected,and third: get punched by your teammate then reconnect
Just a good gaming chair
Why is this cheating but wall bouncing and supergliding aren't cheating?
I think the first one is a bug because if you disconnect your wifi then somebody punches you and it stacks so you get launched
These were really common in Halo 2 backnin the day
The launching thing isn't a cheat it's a bug that is activated by disconnecting your internet jumping getting punched a bunch and the boost stacks from being punched he plugs the internet back in and he gets launched
Its not a cheat, the first one. He disconnects his wifi
speed hacks and instant armour swaps he froze himself mid air then his teammates punches momentum stacks since so he goes flying
That launch reminds me of the old supply bin escapes
Interesting packet/tick limit
I know the cheat when he gets flinged
His team is punching him because if you unplug your Internet and then punch them so many times they start and go flying
the first "cheat" happens when someone disconnects their internet you can use a thing called a lag switch to do it and the other player punches you and it stores the momentum from the punches then it releases once the person turns it back on.
insane wallhack :DDD
The floating isn't a hack, you just unplug ur internet when u jump
The first one in the first half it’s not a cheat, but if he jumps and he gets hit by a teammate, there’s a glitch where you get launched
Bros like the crates in the beginning of apex that could send you flying
The first one isn't a cheat it's a trick you can try yourself, jump in air, disconnect your internet, have your teamate punch you while you're reconnecting
That's the new glitch btw not a cheat bit aimbot naw
The freezing i mid air is actually a glitch anyone can do pull out thr ethernet cable when you jump then your team m8 punches you and then it saves the momentum of the punches until you reconnect the other 2 are cheats
The flying thing is apperently not cheats, and can be done by dcing your wifi
First "cheat" that launched him was a glitch anyone can do
You can do this glitch by disconnecting your internet connection mid air, getting a teammate to punch you then reconnecting
Only in Ohio
I have seen this cheat since I started playing at the end of season 13. I met a guy and I still have him in my discord :)
The out of bounds zone: Ah yes, another victim
The punch and fly kind of reminds me of the loot pill glitch from season 2 or 3
That’s how I know y’all young or have no childhood. Y’all never seen god mode
new crypto buff is insane
The music during the first ascension 🤣🤣🤣
Bro made the re-45 in the care package 🤣
bro ascended to Valhalla
That punch launch seems similar to a very early Apex Legends bug, were you punch a loot bin with a octane jump pad on it, and the punches for some reason increases the launch power of the next launch pad jump.
Second hack happened to me and I got knocked 😂😂🤦‍♂️
💤💤💤💤 seen it everyday everynight fuck em all 🖕🏾
his just really good bro, not cheating.
As disgusting as explorers are, the launch cheat is one I would use just for the memes
If nadia tried apex
That’s LC Pro Elite cheat
What pos!!!!
And this is why I would never be a PC gamer 😝
Wait this is just a theory but I reckon that hack some how goes off the old supply bin bug that's why his teammate has to punch him
zelda vibes
all mod menus are the same since ps3. different game, same cheats
But u know they say there's no cheaters
I came across a hacker like that before in a Apex mach.
Lmao imagine Having to cheat in Any video game at All Cuz they're garbage with NO skill!!💯🤦‍♂️🤣🤣
Have you ever seen somebody throw 20 tacticals at the same time
Lmao dude no cap u sound like the nerd emoji 🤓
That hackers teammate is a bro
Meanwhile GTA V cheaters: PATHETIC
Isn't this from the gaming merchant
These are old cheats bro
Yes I have but I thought they were glitches guess ive killed a few hackers but this explains a lot cus Ived died to many times to flying people as well
I'll never understand the fun of aim bot, wall hacks etc....
Autoloot and airstuck and the knockback stacks up
Nah that's just Itz Timmy
That cheat reminds me of the glitch with supply bins and respawn beacons
The one he never seen is a glitch.
The launching in the air isn’t the back he is storing momentum when he freezes in the air then he launches in the air
Damn hackers ruining my favourite game.....go harass cod or fortnite lobby's with this crap
I remember this hacker on fortnite who froze everyone we could break things shoot build and loot but we didnt fall we couldnt walk nothing and suddenly ewe could move and hed killed 30 people lol. Thats the only time no one was shot at in tilted me and this other guy both had guns and were staring at eachother like “wtf?” There were people chillin on the ground with guns like idk it was unsettling lol
Check out my latest second channel upload: https://youtu.be/8rrcEp_lUGo
That looks so fun to play 😐
It does exist, just not a ton of people using it
There was one provider I used that you were able to fly/float and get infinite plasma beams
WhatIhate most about gaming.. cheaters..
The first one is actually a bug not too long ago if i remember correctly, where youd punch the supply bin and jump ontop of it afterwards
That was me
This advanced movement hits different
Only ogs remember when you could put octanes jump pad over bins and punch to increase the fly back
old one, they used to use ziplines then freeze on top in edge to beam half the map with their spitfire
His aim it was really weird
bro used soldier 76 ult
Bro just that dr strange treatment
Lol, this is new to me… hilarious 🤣 😅
I don’t understand how hackers have fun on games
This is why I stay away from PC
Some people using cheats to just have fun. Like the good ole 90’s with cheat books hahaha. Good times
the punching one can also happen without cheats (only if you lag out)
Oh my fucking god hacker are the worst
That wasn't aimbot, he just unlocked the smart pistol.
Its called lastcheat i use it btw
Bro must’ve just got on a new gaming chair
Playing red dead in first clip
I havent just seen the man ive used them you can get them for only 10 bucks for an entire month
perfectily reasonable explination his wall hax are actually the smat pistol from titan fall 2
Anyone remember the hacker tufi In shivfps game!?
He's just got a good gaming chair
Is this the first time we've seen this tho? Cuz I def remember something like this happening
Just yesterday I saw someone            useing hacks he was shooting through the walls
Bro started playing minecraft
They call it EASY anti cheat for a reason
Yoooo who remember knock back glitch in mw2 when you would shoot the guys head and they would go flying?? Good times
https://youtu.be/cN50WUqVUSQ
With the flying glitch you used to be able to do it with loot crates lol
Ngl it looks fun
Tbh I wouldn't report because this is hilarious
the first unique cheat makes my head creat the avengers theme song over and over again ..oh god I could hear it again
I wish these people would just stop. :/
Na he just has a good gaming chair
Nah he has a good gaming chair💀
Proof fortnite is better
Og apex remember when you encounter guys like this while EA was still thinking apex was just another BR which will die in 6 months so why ban cheaters??
Apex anti cheat is the most GARBAGE in the industry. Who ever handles this should be fired at Respawn
Octane mains are drooling at that launching across the map cheat
Man said “star platinum the world”
Maybe he just unplugged his Wi-Fi and jumps
Nah mate he got rbg razor cheir
That floating cheat is there since like season 6/7
He ascended
Shinra tensei
They fly now!?!?
They gotta add auto loot for controller players I hate having to fight against a PC player that swaps his armor for the 6th time then I run out of ammo and die
It's using the kinetic energy bug that used be on loot bins. Go back and watch videos of the super jumping off lootbins. You had to push one spot on a loot bin...and then the otherwise would be supercharged with kinetic energy and launch you above the map
I remember a glitch like that in season 1. But god I didnt knew that was a thing for hackers😂🤦‍♂️ This game is so broke
when he's frozen he's storing the momentum from the punches from his teammate.
I just hate that there are so many hackers in ranked, they're lame as fk like go play trios if you're gonna ruin the game for everyone
The flying thing then his teamate pucnvhing him is a glitch with internet connection where it will freeze them where they are then if anyone punches them it will just build up the momentum and launch them with what he’s doing is freezing him self in the air so he can basically fly
My man used geppo dude sky walking on that one piece pack is he JESUS
He just has a good gaming chair
So we’re just gonna let him pass with the “it wasn’t me cheating. It was someone else”. Shit is in first person. He was cheating. 🤣
Yall dumb he just got a good gaming chair
Found a really blatant cheater yesterday name is SCVOIDTIKTK
I have seen this, a long time ago I seen a clip where there were multiple streamers in one ranked match and they got killed by a guy floating in the middle of a jump tower and killing people from across the map with a charge rifle while Wigg was spectating
The old no clip
honestly if every hacker starts using insane cheats like these I wouldn't mind if I get to spectate them
So pathetic
The interstellar music when he floated away sent me lmaooo😂😂😂
They're evolving💀
I saw a clip before with floating and infinite charge rifle. That’s the satellite weapon
No wonder apex removed aimassest
He wasn't cheating if that pistol followed them
They aren't even hiding it anymore
It reminds me of knock back mods from mw3 when it first came out you got download the files to your account off a USB and plug it in and create a custom game save with knock back that launches you, unlimited pred missiles, akimbo guns that can't be akimbo. You could also do something like this on another old game. I want to say it was another call of duty but something is telling me it was borderlands. Where you can freeze jump then you take shared damage from your team mate. When you undo the freeze jump it launched you super high. I was like 13/14 when I did this so its been over 10 years
Not gonna lie the flying cheat would be fun but aim bot and walls seriously?
People are scum. Cheating in a battle royal game is low. Just get good and hit your shots for real you fn losers!
I can't stand cheats, makes the game easy and boring. There is no actual challenge
Seen the shield on befo
Looks like fun I wouldn't even kill people I'd just bamboozle them with the magic floating
He's just valk ulting 100%
Not sure how all of it works but I can explain the supper jump thing. So when you are making games that involve jumping devs use this thing called a bool. A bool is a yes or no question and is used to ask the game either "yes, the player is touching the ground and therefore can jump." or "No the player is in the air therefore can't jump."  Now since apex use momentum-based movement the hacker wants to build that momentum in a direction. Whenever a player is punched, a force moves the player adding momentum and knocking them back. With the hacker being frozen in the air the bool in air is true meaning the momentum from the punches will keep adding up until he unfreezes and flies in the direction of the last punch.
I think the flying thing stacks the knock back ur teammates can give ya for punching you
I guess he store some kinetic energy and then wosh
Nah bro swapped to creative mode
Dude really said i must go my people need me
Imagine a cheat that is just allows you to aimbot with grenades... but they still have drop so it's just normal apex😂🤣
No he’s just got a god gaming chair
Oh no bad players from Fortnite or modern warfare finally start using cheats on apex
LMAO THAT'S ZA WARUDOOO XDDDDDD THIS MADLAD DID IT...JOJO IN A VIDEOGAME, LITERALLYYYY XDDD
So it's like stasis in botw I compare stuff to that game all the time but it's such a good game
Bro like’s my people need me
Bro’s gaming chair is supreme 💀
Y'all just bad he was clearly using the smart pistol from titan fall 2
Why are u giving attention to have? Wonder how u got the vid
I looks like a force lag or something so he doesnt send packets to the server and when they all go thru the momentum just goes brrr
Dude I kind of want to make a hacking account just so I can fuck around and make people laugh. Imagine seeing a caustic flying trough the air on a glass trap dropping infinite health packs and shields across the map
Oh boy glad im not on pc
Bro has the re 45 from titanfall the one with auto aim what aimbot?
Or is this just the modded apex
He’s legit he just has an insane gaming chair
It looks so fun tho
Bro just used time stop
omg my friend and i ran into a wattson who had that cheat w them floating in the air. we were so confused!!
i'm not even mad this is funny😂
He made Apex into MC bro went creative mode
He made Apex into MC bro went creative mode
floating has been in since like S2
It was the upgraded version of smart pistol bruh
Well would you look at this.. 😂 That’s me cheating btw lol
He's just way better
Bro jes not cheating its just the smart pistols from titanfall
nah bro it's his gaming chair
slient aim isnt rare
Sv cheats no clip
anyone else see the hackers ult had aimbot too and locked on to the player
oh my gosh this man installed the season 1 glitch where you could punch a supply bin and launch yourself across the map
Man went creative mode in a whole different game
Dam even hackers need teammate help.
Naaah thats just skill bro
Another reason to not play Apex. 😉
It reminds me of that one glitch with those orange supply box thingies back in I thiiiink… season 3? Where you could punch the shit out of them and then jump off the top and it would fling you across the map (we used it a lot to escape the ring or get over the top of firefights)
Pathy should have tried to grapple as he took off.
I’ve never seen hacks like that but I do know certain bugs in the game now cause a similar effect where your game crashes and sometimes when your teammates punch you it will store momentum and eventually send multiple times the distance it would have normally gone
Bro is doing reverse BTBs (bullet time bounces Zelda is cool)
I imagine that freeze one is a force impulse similar to the box glitch from a while ago, most likely does something similar
Dude in creative mode
Nah at the beginning he was just using the auto lock pistol from titan fall
Pretty sure the first one was airstuck same thing with tf2 tele glitch
Y’all should see the grenade aimbot 🤣 arc stars everywhere
it’s the final boss
I play on console and a few times I’ve been teammates with the person that’s constantly pinging death boxes from across the map
Bro doesn’t have aimbot. He found the smart pistol and smart rifle
Nah he just good
I have these cheats XD
Nah he has a conttroler
Bro pulled up with the sheka slate
The 2 hacks that you have never seen are basically a jojo part 5 stand
See the shield swap one quite a bit
One time I ran into someone dualweilding hop-up devos with aimbot
Man this reminds me of legend of zelda
Nah he just got a good gaming chair
Wtf
“Have you ever seen a cheat like this” Me a minecraft player: yes
I'm part of a cheating community and that first cheat is called air stuck. You can press a key and it will let you stuck in a air anytime you press that key bind. 2nd is a auto loot same as you press a key to set into a key bind you want and it will auto loot you the best armor or armor that is new and not broken. But you need to be close to a death box with the armor inside of it. Plus that aimbot is called psilent it lets you hit target inside a circle ⭕ fov of that circles on your screen. And you can change the fov you like the more fov  the more rage, you hit any target inside the fov. You dont really need to aim only it will hit your target inside the fov.
Imagine hating your life so much you have to cheat in a video game
I knew I wasn’t crazy. I played with someone and they pick up a shield from a box so fast
I seen it just forgot what it was called
I think that launch cheat would actually work as an in game ability
Those are actually pretty unique cheats
Well...When you broke a shield of an enemy.The same armor that enemy uses will come to you too
Ight
The punching one is not a hack its a glitch
How can this be remotely fun
Jojo reference?
This game is so fucked. The anti-cheat is so good at detecting standard walls and aimbot, so now the cheaters can stack punch momentum to fling themselves across the map lmao.
Store works through
Bros playing breath of the wild
Bro the pathfinder playing breath of the wild
Using a lagswitch to fly.... Damn
Bro he just has a good gaming chair 🪑
The floating one is not a cheat it’s a glitch you can do on pc I’m pretty sure
That freeze cheat is probably so he can stack velocity from the punch knock back
Kind of glad I'm not on PC
It’s all because of the gaming chair
Bro he had kenesis from breath of the wild
The freeze cheat is kinda like Zelda botw. You freeze the object, built momentum by punching and unfreeze. Huh.
A cheap mobile ripoff game of PUBG has better anti-cheating systems than these battle games with a Top of the class development team
Nah he using the smart pistol
He got that gamer chair
That's hilarious imagine being so bad at the game and half to use hacks like this skill issue I c.
Bro harnessed the power of octane jump pad
Airstuck is an exploit in some source engine games which freezes your position but your velocity gets added to every time you get punched. So it stacks
He was building up speed
The armour swapping one isnt unique almost all cheaters use that one
That flying one is a glitch but that other shit idk bout that
That flying is from the Loot bin bug
He gets locked in the air storing his velocity and when he gets punched that also gets stored so when he unlocks he flies
Mf said unique😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man entered creative mode
Bro i need his gaming chair
50% of cheaters cheat to have fun even though its fucked up
The launch isn’t cheats, its and exploit where by playing windowed and clicking and holding the X it lets you store momentum in the air, which is why his teammate was punching him. Still unfair but not cheating
People who use these deserve the worst in life. This is probably as happy as they ever feel.
So call of duty 4 had a glitch like this called the "Freeze Jump" found by [eXo] Clan.  You could put the @ symbol in your clan tag and if you were to jump and press the scoreboard button it would give you an error on your screen an freeze you in place.   Having a friendly knife you from below a bunch of times would build up a force that gets applied as soon as you would exit the error screen.  twas pretty gnarly
I remember doing glitches like this before but never seen them as a hack
Legend of zelda botw kinda stuff
Just lag
Imagine cheating at a skill based game 🤡
I’ve seen auto collect cheats wall hacks aimbots and freeze hacks where it freezes you in place and than you can unfreeze yourself launching you to god and of course if you know battlefield you can take no damage from teammates but you can launch yourself in a jeep basically same logic except a freeze hack
Ultimately he is like a god
This man's been playing too much breath of the wild lmao
This is basically as the creat glitch from I think season 0
POV:windbombs
Must be a pc thing
looks similar to the glitch back in season 0 where if u punched the inside of a loot bin and then stood on it and got sent flying
I’m console so I always chalk everything up to me being ass but idk man sometimes these r99 a lil to accurate outta nowhere from hella far 💀
Bro lei tra ley went creative mode
I ain’t even mad I’m just impressed
Nah your trippin he is just using the legend jack cooper
The floating reminds me of the bin glitch where we would punch an open bin and once done get on top, punch it and be sent off flying, me and my friends did that before season 1
I feel like the floating is a real glitch but the wallhack idk
That is not a hacker, that is one of forbiden wizards who have infine powers
Never seen it as a cheat but a glitch yeah the OG’s know what I’m talking about and I still have PTSD of that mounted Sheila on crypto’s drone it’s like I was in Afghan
I can do much more human…. proceeds to fly out the map…..
Nah he is just really good
Wholesome cheater
I have only seen the punch launch once and that was because of a bug
Cum
He switched to Creative mode
This is more evidence that this game is fucking rotting
Ok, now I need him to freeze himself for like thirty minutes with a guy just punching him over and over. That way, we can get the first apex legend to the moon
Honestly I wanna do the whole "yeet" cheat just to mess around, like I wouldn't use it for bad I'd just use it to have fun and then scream in a mickey mouse voice "it's nerf or nothing!" 🤣🤣
Not the jumping one, but one YouTuber I watch has seen the loot box one
That wasn’t hacking that was A S C E N D I N G
Bro he must have a crazy gaming chair
He stasis launches
When he flout I was like it's jesus
Man's has the Minecraft No clip
The flying one is just lag taking over
Guy really thought he downloaded Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
ive joined a match with a guy using the one where he froze in the air, the guy just said “ayo bro can you start wailing on me” the weird thing was that he didn’t seem to have the wall hacks or aim bot
My private chests are best, aimbot, triggerbot, esp. Only 3 in pack but they are undetectable now for like a year!
First of all. Imagine being so bad at the game that you have to cheat. Second it just ruins the game for everyone else. (Im taking about every cheater not the yter)
It might be a glitch for the flying one
I was able to replicate this partly without the use of hacks, a completely manual way.
It shouldn't have hackers in the first place fr boring
Skill issue
Ngl that wind up and launch hack looks kinda fun, but as a console player you’ll never get to see this type of fun
That's not aimbot, that is silent aim
Damn bro he got stasis
He made the cheats all by himself he could be using java or HTML code for the cheats it depends on what kind of code is apex
Bro was in Minecraft creative mode
Bro activated Fortnite creative mode...
Isnt that lag switching the punching one
It's like the jojo stand arts and crafts
This man is going down in history for being the first hacker in apex legends
Reminds me of when you could punch loot boxes and jump off them. 😢😢😢 bring that baaaack
I haven't  seen
Hacking in apex is getting pretty bad
yea ive seen these,  ive also seen one where you can speed up and slowndown your game and spawn and ult at any time
Hes cheating in a creative way?
These players need to be banned by their ip
bro that's awesome
I don't think I've ever seen a hacker in general
insane aimbot bro missed like 10 shots with the re 45
It ain't cheats it's a glitch
Bro got hit with that legend of Zelda stasis+
Only in mw3 custom hacked/modded lobbies
How did you get his footage you are the cheater don't put crap like this on YouTube your an  advertisement for scumbags
Nah he is just a pilot
The master Race
Wouldn't see this on console
Bro got the SmartPistol
We can do nothing but be impressed tbh. Like yea he’s a virgin but for some reason I love this guy
He literally has stasis from breath of the wild
Bro used the Breath of the Wild stasis lmao
???
Man took stasis from link
Crazy how everyone is amused by this….correction everyone on console lmao
Apesex leggings
Bro just found Jack cooopers smart pistol.
#apexlegdens
I've seen the fling thing once best part was he was just using it for fun he didn't try to win just wanted to surprise people with a fly-by
He ain’t hacking hes just got a good gaming chair
Ooouuuuuu that brothers floating in the aiirr
My guy has stasis from BOTW?!
Cheating in apex seems like the only game where cheating would be fun
Nah nah he just got a new gaming chair, it's real obvious it's the new chair.
If you cheat don't play
Feels more like a bug exploit to me... But ok...
When I was playing halo competitivly there was a very very very good hacker plaguing the ranked scene and this guy has moved on to other game titles the guy is insane at hacks I finally had a conversation with him after a ranked game he was in and I asked him why he does it and makes the game not fun for alot of people and his response was im bored........ The guy literally couldn't be stopped no matter the anit cheat put in place he would bypass it with ease...... I'm sure the dude has moved onto other games and the dude sells hacks to alot of people... Ever since I switched to Apex and have been solo queing trying to get better at apex to play on a competitive level and I have came across a couple cheaters that just scream they have got cheats from this guy and this def looks like his work
Nah just a realy gud gamer chair
I have, *once* it was so intresting I wasn't even mad I was fascinated by how intresting the cheat was
Bro now there brining breath of the wild mechanics into apex bruh
One time I saw a guy abuse a clipping glitch with a crate I believe there's a bag when the first game came out or the game first came out tongue twist I guess anyway pretty much he glitched himself in the crate and then got stuck there and that in his teammate shot him with a shotgun but since he had an immortality hack he didn't take any damage but it did build up momentum he flew straight across the island over the mountain into the ocean
I like how they perfectly capture this hackers
There used to be a glitch with supply crates where you punched the supply crate x amount of times to build up momentum then you just jump and you get launched
you literally met God
He can... He can manipulate the physics. Normally that wouldn't store momentum... That's beyond simple lag switches and the like. What the hell.
Bros using stasis😂😂😂😂
Played since season 0 never seen this season 0 the og season spitfire op that season
I think it’s more of a glitch
Nah that’s just a better gaming chair
Clearly u never watch Hal vs cheater clip...
Bro is jesus
Never seen cheats
“NaH bRo He’S jUsT gOoD aT tHe GaMe”
Nah he just lagging
Points for creativity
It's a shame nobody . That's what's up paying video games I saw my PlayStation 5 my box x it's not worth playing anymore.. I think the game industry after a while you're just going to go bankruptcy...
Legend of Zelda?
The only cheat id want to use it to not have the return to battle thing i like being up really high
Every time I see a video like this I'm glad to be a console scrub. All the cheaters seem to love PC 🥰
If you turn off your game mid jump and get hit then it stacks and you fly
Bro used botw stasis 💀
Dude and his buddy must play Legend of zelda Botw
this is the most wacky smart ass type shi ever
Ark
He just has a good gaming chair
It’s called no clip and auto hot loot
I wonder if this is even a cheat, that flying part atleast. I think its using wifi-disconnecting from the server, or sending just enough packets to leave him in the game. Would make sense right?
This is fake…
Tf1 auto aim pistol leaked lmao
You should call the cops
Why does no one aim
Neo!!!!!
This looks like more of fun than toxic
My boy has the respawn ship animation
Bro turned into link from zelda breath of the wild
Honestly apex and the newer warzones just always take me back to the old MW Lobbies. Remember in like the OG MW if you tried to jump on after a year or two of its release the only lobbies you'd find were absolutely chaotic hacked lobbies
Bro had the smart pistol in the first clip💀
It's just so sad that some people are so bad they have to cheat it's honestly such a low thing to do
I think it’s a glitch not cheats
Apex on PC will always be horrible
Imagine it was a dummy getting his revenge
EA adds fall damage, and his cheats are done
Nope it's just good
Im kind of impressed
i was rampart camping and a bloodhound just fell from the sky... in front of me and my friend on turrets, he just fell... from nowhere, he got gunned down instantly
Goofy ass cheats
I believe that for the launch he was holding minimize/ X on his game tab while his partner hit him. This saved the knockback and such to his character data but it could not execute the data til the player character synced up with the server when he  stops holding minimize/The X.
I saw someone with an invisibility hack/glitch, it was a Octane that disappeared on command so you'd shoot him and he'd disappear then Za Worldo behind you and kill you. I spectated him for the whole game and he died to a Rampart wall/Charged Rampage combo and came 2nd with like over 4k damage
Bro he has Craft works from jojos
He just has a good gaming chair
Old as fuck
Decent little superglide tho
The punch thing isn't hacking, it's a glitch
He has a smart pistol a jump kit and a loba ult 😂
Bro got that aimbot from titanfall 2
Yes
its like botw stasis
The reason why his teammate needs to punch him is because he takes zero knockback when he’s is frozen and knock back StacksMeaning that all of the knockback stored up sends him flying
Yo why were you watching me in your video
That why apex mobile is better
Stop hating, he's just cracked
This dude is cracked 🥶
That stop mid air is like the ability in legends of Zelda breath of the wild.
You can clearly tell this is a person who has no life
That who I saw flying across the map
It's floatin Hehehahahahaha It's a floater auuuuughhhhhh
Jojo reference
The launching thing is prolly a lag switch or maybe cheats
That's why PC players are trash
His float cheats looks like that one LOZ clip
Man got hover
I personnaly play on console but once i was playing on my friends pc to try out how that plays And there was this hacker who seemed to instantly regain his ult (he was playing bangalore) so i had like 8000 rolling thunders fall down on me To be honest it really wasnt the worsed cheat because i could hide inside But still a special cheat non the least
Wtf?
Its like the old deathbox glitch were you could punch it and get launched!
The RE-45 is awesome for hacks
Q&A:What game started apex???
The fly glitch works by freezing himself then letting the falling momentum of being mid air build up and his friend punches him to send him in a direction instead of straight up
Nah bro just had a good gaming chair
I've seen the looting cheat but not the floating one
You have to let it all go neo....
What a creature  💀
I love how the super jump is like what you can do in G Mod
You just need a lag switch for the punch one
Fly hack
It's just ping
They took the mechanic from what u could do to crates back in the day, nothing special
It looks like a stun lock or freeze of sorts where the knockback from the melees gets stacked up
Mans literally stole a stand from JoJo
I’ve seen the auto loot boxes but no the flying one
Man is a walking gravity cannon
It's called "Last Cheat"
I’ve seen something similar in Gmod, and botw but mainly Gmod
This glitch started in season 3, you could stand on loot crates and punch them 20-30 times to build momentum. Then you would put a jump pad on it, it would send you across the entire map
Stuff like this is why I'm glad I play on console and not PC
Also a invincibility hack from a lifeline i played with
He most likely built those cheats himself knowing that a lot of cheaters now are building their own
The flying one is possible with out cheats but to do it your internet has to cut out mid air and then if your teammates punch you and it reconnects you get launched buts extremely hard to do on purpose
He's using the pistol in the last mission from titanfall
Recently ive been seeing people who instantly loot deathboxes and people using stuff like shield batteries while full sprinting like batt swinging and stuff
so he  has Vecna cursed from stranger things 4 😂
Pc players be like with aim assist 😂 but it then goes console players complaining about pc players cause sometimes we get pooped on
he is not cheating he is just so good 😂(lol)
Tf i spectated the exact same guy in my match woth cheats
https://youtube.com/shorts/DouEMBifNh0?feature=share
Octane's jump pad but it's better or (ultra pro max)
I’ve never seen exploiters at all
Why do all these tiktokers sound identical? No chance I’m in a simulation
Pathfinder's new friend :)
I've only seen charge rifle aimbot in arenas 💀
it’s like that one stand from jojo part 5
The flying over the map looks like suspended fall which is overcharged by the punches' knockback. There were such exploits back in earlier seasons that I remember seeing and doing, but that seems new. If it's an exploit, it's not technically a hack so it may not be punishable to the same extent
The first one remind me form g mod hide and seek back in vanoss old videos they would punch the seek and it would throw him across the map
I want them now LMFAO
Gravity, is a harness.  I have harnessed the harness.
The flying punch cheat is honestly one I'll love to experience. Makes rotating look hella fun.
Oh that's just his stand: Kraft work
Do people use simple hacks? Like slightly more damage? Like 10% more or take 10% less damage?
bro is using the smart pistol😂😂
I think he just had the smart pistol
man transcended
Fuck apex they don’t do shot about cheaters
This reminds me of the octane jump pad launch glitch just without his ult
Man took the auto loot feature in Apex mobile into the main game... Amazing 😂
Ol
THOSE ARE MY IRL FRIENDS LJAAAJJAJAHAHAHAHHAHHAHA LOOLLLL I LOVE THIS
People see one video of apex hackers. Oh that's qhy I don't play that game lol stfu
Yo that was my friend it was so wierd
they have a cheap security that can be bypassed my cousin says lol he always makes new mod menus for certain players why does he do it? to see people cry lol
Honestly I think he  having fun
Lmao his using the old Source bug enhanced with cheats and his teammate punching
Filthy cheaters
Am i the only one who heard Interstellar music ??
Cyber hunter hackers be like damn y'all now got those hcks
Bro what do you mea. He just has a good gaming chair
I had that shit happen to me today
I guess He doesn't like cheating He only wanted to try creative mode
I’ve the seen the second one not done with actual cheats but lag. Homeboy was having a bad day with internet and got stuck in the area for a few seconds. A friend and I were messing around by punching him while he was suspended in mid air until we were all launched in random directions for great distances! I believe it has something to do with all the momentum being stored and built from the punches then realesed whenever desired. This fella had a hack that did that on command. portable launch cannon lmaoo
He's using the ability of Kraft Work.
You know that makes sense. . . Recently I've been seeing more and more players who seem to be hacking, one match I was in Arenas and I would shoot at this Caustic and it literally wouldn't do any damage so I thought I was dumb and couldn't aim, then I pushed in and still didn't do any damage even though I could see my bullets hit him, then he like unfroze and killed me. . . Also one match with a Wraith who seemed to be using wifi cheat or something cause everytime the Wraith pushed me my game would start to lag and rubberband really bad and he would hit all his shots when all of mine would completely miss. This need to fix Apex, I also hate how their are so many Smurfs and Bot Accounts now, takes the fun out of the game.
Honestly have u ever played pubg 😂😂
Tbh ppl who uses cheats like aimbot and others they suck at shooting or don't want to spend there time to practice and not making it fun for others, whoever uses cheats just stop and just practice bro theirs no need for it.
meet a guy that can skywalk he killed me from the air so i kept watching him the guy was running on air
I saw something similar I saw a caustic fly from one spot to another kind of like how Newcastle does with his ult
Talk about hackers I just saw him hipfire that re45 like a smart pistol
Which server has the most cheaters?
The floaty thing is called no clip lol
Bro it’s because he opened the menu that’s why he’s floating
WHAT A DAY DUDE! WHAT A DAY! You will tell your grandsons and daughters about this in a 100 years ago! Amazing! Its too crazy for me! Everything! Dude! Wtf dude! Duuuuude i mean duuude!
Apex anticheat: This looks fine
Back in season 0, if you punched a supply bin then jumped off of it you would be sent flying across the map
Hackers are wild know
I hope they fixed this
Stand user: cheater Stand name: craft work
Bro thought he was playing breath of the wild
Jesus
My man using the smart pistol
Yes and No
these are the cheats I would use, wacky and somewhat useful...not that I'd actually do it
Nah that’s just him being good at hipfire then he tap strafed but it looks likes he’s floating and he’s fast at sheild swapping
There evolving
The music just makes everything
Remind me of the loot bin launch glitch
OH NO THEY’RE EVOLVING
Lol that is why i play br and not ranked
So that just a flying hack but he’s kinda just holding it the fly hack since it doesn’t move unless he says so the punch dmg builds and then he disables flight the punch damage releases
They’re getting creative
Let me guess. PC?
Ive seen some of the auto shield swap cheat and this one where they could loot from behind doors and through objects (,sometimes) mind blowing stuff
Ohhhhhh I remember this kind back then when you punch the loot box it builds momentum it was so fun he’s doing the same thing with the freeze
There was one instance where me and my brother were playing a match and there were no respawn beacons near us and he had killed a bloodhound and as soon as he killed them they just like spontaneously respawned which didn't make sense at all.
I've seen these cheats before. I seen a loba float on the ceiling while one clipping my entire team.
Bro turned into valk
I want !!!
ngl that cheating looks fun
Bro got the smart gun in titanfall 2
PC players that do this shit must be ass in just about any game
It looks like the glitches from Apex mobile. They have the flying lag glitch and one of the functions is auto loot.
I saw someone do that and I looked at his code. Basically he gets himself at an angle and when you punch someone they move so he stopped himself, his friend punched him then he goes black panther and builds that energy so when it stopped it shoots him with all the force up in the air
Brooooo I RAN I TO SOMEONE WHO DID THIS LAST NIGHT!!!!!!
Reminds me to the bug when you were flying of bins after punching them a lot.
The jump glitch is a old glitch that use to be with the supply boxes pre much same out come just different ways to do it since he pausing lmao
I’ve seen the instant armour swaps before but the random floating reminds me of horse tilting from elder scrolls
Nah he just got a good gaming chair
Haven't seen like actually cheaters like you know hacks and everything but I came across it was the first time and it's so far been the only time I found a team teaming up in Apex it was so annoying
NA player： first time seeing this  Asia hong kong server player : First time？ Its here for a long time bro
He’s not cheating he’s just has a better gaming chair
I've seen in other games
They should add the death timer to cheaters so they can’t cheat even on ground
Lmao I know these cheats I've used them before u should subscribe to my channel for more Cheater videos
Habibi come to.PUBG MOBILE here we have all type.of hackers
Bro was playing Minecraft 💀
Dont glorify cheating it only promotes it
Last week I found a Loba that literally stole armor off my player from a black market. Literally could take anything they wanted. In ranked a couple of seasons ago I came across a Bloodhound that was moving through walls. Crazy hacks out there.
Nah bro he just has a really good gaming chair
Mans had the smart pistol
Yes I’ve seen both of them
Nah McDonald's wifi
Sv_grativy_80
I took a break from apex because I got tired of people's inhuman aim
This is why you need to upgrade to PlayStation from pc dying race.  Literally zero cheating. Its the best option! I just use my pc for strategy etc.
Fly hacking I have see a lot is common but  Inventory Looking that's new fir the books
Ngl that punch one looks fun
console cheats/mods may not be as good but the fact that they're undetectable and prevalent at Plt and above is just disheartening
This is nothing. As an Asian I run into cheaters daily, one time I get punched to death middle of the drop.
Bro playing on Singapore servers
hey bro if you're envious that he plays and shoots better than you it's not his problem stop being on fire and calling anyone who plays better than you a cheat if you don't know how to fly It's not your problem to stop crying damn girl        sarcasm to the extreme
2nd one is pretty known actually. Completely automatic. Also there is a cheat where you can spawn shields onto you. Maybe it’s a better loba ult only for yourself, but idk
“Have you ever seen cheats like this” Mine craft players 👀👀👀👀
This world shall know pain All mighty push !
Im a hacker without using hacks, thanks latinoamerica If valkirie was lore accurate.
Kraftwork stand      I think I need help
There used to be a glitch like this with the supply bins
They've ascended
He’s just super laggy with a good gaming chair
(Halo flashbacks)🤣🤣
Bros playing BOTW
So I was playing apex legends when I hired this cheater jk jk and no never obviously If I saw that they get banned
Bro was in creative
That floating one is the old loot bin glitch
the weird thing is the punch cheat actually used to be a glitch with octanes jump pad where if you punched it enough times it would send you flying to the skybox
But pc players complain about aim assist
He’s playing breath of the wild lmfao
I be seeing things like this and ppl not making this more known hackers, aim bot/aim hackers, aim assist users need to be banned
Damn that floating hack is kinda funny ngl
I haven’t seen a hacker since the mw2 days back when people had J-tags.. If there’s hackers in my lobbies now I don’t notice them at all
That’s not hacks he’s just better than you
It’s launching cheat where you pause midair and however many times you hit that guy he goes launching
cheaters are so fkn lame man like just play the game
The auto shield swap is the unbelievable part saw a vid on a cheater and it’s way to op
I saw the pathy pov on tiktok i think he was buggin and hacking
Nah He's Just Having A Good Gaming Chair No Cheatinh
*just a persian guy network
No he just has a smart pistol
This isn’t cheating. It’s FALLING…with style👽 *Buzz lightyear voice* 😆
Developer moad
https://youtu.be/WIqleyuYHCQ
ive the insta loot but not the float
That fling cheat is fucking stasis from BotW. This isn't your average cheater, this is a man who's played too much Zelda.
Na he has a good gaming carpet no hacks
I think he freezes his movement and the knock from the punches stacks
This looks like a private cheat or one he coded himself
Nah he's not cheating just has a really good gaming chair.
Be be like if link could stasis himself
The first part where he is floating is called airstuck
Future is now, old man
Meh seems legit to me
He's using stasis on himself
I don't know man he seems like a pretty normal apex player to me
Man has creative mode on
And i got banned for i dont f.cking know why . fascinating work ea
The audacity to play bloodhound while cheating😭
titanfall smart pistol mf
Oh yeah, Rainbow Six Siege has had all types of flying aim botters lol
Lmfao bro I’m just watching pathfinder punch him and him go flying. Sometimes I think a good game has to be quirky. The punching mechanics is the funniest clunkiest shit ever
Ever heard of autismgaming?
If you use a p2020 or an re45 with aimbot in apex, it’s just a better auto pistol and personally, I would just call it a feature.
He’s just using the smart pistol
Wait this was the same game that tgm was in and he got killed by this hacker
Bro that's just the smart pistol
Respawn rlly went down hill ever since they quit on titanfall
Well, in the first seconds of this video he doesn't cheat, he just uses smart pistol from titanfall
Than theirs everyone saying warzones got cheaters.
That’s old, I quit playing on pc because there’s mostly cheaters on there
There's a new hack where they can equip akimbo with anygun, anytime
I remember playing on xbox one and downed a bloodhound and instantly he self revive, downed him again and self revive again, then he finally downed me and killed me. I started to watch him and recorded a clip of that cheat. Everytime somebody downed him, he selfrevived in less than a second and kicks everybodys ass. Literally you cant kill that dude. Its time to apex to take a look on cheaters but I guess it wont happen cause microtransactions are more important.
Apex cheats are just insane these days
Old cod lobbies be like:
I wouldn’t even be mad if he killed me
Ummm saw a flying car
Hol up, mans just used stasis from breath of the wild
He just got the smart pistol from Titanfall
I've seen this kind of cheat back Combat Arms days, you could see people flying around and stabbing the air killing everyone in the server.
he is using the smart pistol from titanfall nothing wrong here
We both said wtf at the same time lol
Kick them
Apex legends looks alot like Titanfall 2
this game is a joke
Smat pistol
This is pretty common
It's funny no one is actually good at this game!!!
Long ago I used to do this thing with freezing in the air and punching with my friends in Minecraft to cover long distances. To do this you need game in window mode, jump in game or just be in the air, then hold the window of the game, people punch you a lot, you build up a momentum, then return to game and it launches you just like here.
I have but not as cheats but in a speed run of portal 2.
A type of cheater that still acceptable than aim-bot hacker
Thats just hacking with skills
Bros using the smart pistol from titanfall lmfao
Nah he just found the smart pistol dude
He’s just good
i thought it was the one playing LOL
I have never seen it be possible to cheat in apex
I fought some guy like this in arena's
That punch thing used to work on gears of War I'd fly onto of the clock tower thing
Bruh I seen this person I think
Here in Asian server, no one cares if you're a cheater or not, everyone can shoot their guns which means everyone can kill
I know the cheat he uses to fly it's a UFO mod
the first one hes just use hover perk
Nah, he ain’t cheating he just has the smart pistol from titanfall
The funniest thing about this this is the most normal cheat aswell lmaooo .
When his tm8 punches him and he launches himself . It’s like the loot bin glitch back in season 0
Guy: “How do we improve the state of the game”  Cheaters: “Just compliment us and show how cool we are”  Guy: “Ok…”
Bruh these cheaters and there hacks
He’s just better
I propose a new anticheat: apex piblically leak the IP and address of all hackers
Lololol apex players are such mid losers
"instantly loot out of loot boxes" Me:*looks at Apex Mobile players*
Yooo, he got the Garry's Mod Hide and Seek glitch as a cheat? That's dope. They should make a gun that does that.
hopefully both of them get banned. Even if the path wasn’t cheating he helped a cheater
You ara not play your dead
He has better smart pistol
They ban me for yelling at someone but they don’t ban hackers
I never understood what is the point of cheating in a multiplayer game.
Yuh my friend uses them
Players: Yo bro there are a lot of new cheats out there. Maybe wanna update the anticheat???  Respawns: *Aye mate check this cool collection event we made. Wanna spend another 120-150 dollars to get a brand-new heirloom???*
He was missing shots
That’s not aimbot
I have both cheats
Glad to see this hopefully my buddy will come back to cod 🤣
The cheater was out here playing BOTW gah damn
I hope he knows how garbage he is
The cheat is called lastcheat. It's pretty common.
The first "new" cheat reminds me of the bug in kings canyon where if you would crouch on a supply bin and punch it, it will launch you when you uncrouch
I'ma need that
It's an exploit
Well he can't play cod I gess
This reminds me of Zelda botw
that flying Cheat ...yeah everybody had one and still has one ...ill explain   in apex if you get punched you get momentum  if you are stuck and cant move in any direction the momentum builds up and gets released in the direction you start moving   back in the day you could open containers and keep punching container (container cant move therefor momentum gets saved in it) if you jumped on the container lid it would launch you insanely far (even out of the map if you punched the container Long enough)
I don't want the battlepass
Good gamingchair
Nah  he just good it’s a skill issued
LastLag 🤩
apex is becoming the new warzone
Imagine cheating in a multiplayer game. How sad you need to be :(
That motion stop thing reminds me of a stand from part 5 of jojos
movement pack suspending  seen it in csgo
The first cheat is called no clipping
No offense but these are standard cheats, these things cost like 2 bucks lol
"This player had 2 unique cheats."  Cheater: "my people need me."
Is that a Jojo reference
Then people have the audacity to say pc apex is better then conesole💀
He is using silent aim, you can see the bullets being magnetic to the enemy. The floating in the Air is called airstuck and not that rare. The Autoloot is actually a pretty standard function for clients. But it’s super obvious so I guess people tend to not use it that much
Not a cheat it’s a glitch that’s been going on for like a season already
Don’t play on pc and you won’t have these problems lol
Freeze reminds me of cod4 glitches where you'd be frozen in the air and have friendly fire to shared getting to insane heights
I think it's the first time you've seen it because the cheater has a friend. And the thing is. Most cheaters don't have friends
Yo mans is using physics as a cheat
Stop giving cheater attention
He has to build velocity by freezing and unfreezing bc the cheat engine will recognize it as flying otherwise
Mans unlocked the smart pistol
The first cheat is a momentum building cheat. but! Back in the early day of apex you could do the same by punching loot bins then jumping from them. I used to do it to drop 20s faster
Mans just got an insane gamer chair
The flying one isn’t a hack it’s just him doing something to his internet so he freezes everyone does it in crab games
Cheats but with teamwork!
Why hack if you can play any one of the legends
Nah he a admine or a game developer or something
He used the game collision frozen so then so you know how you get Knockback when you get hit
He's not hacking he just have the smart pistol from titanfall 2
Or lagg
I saw a guy punch me and made me go flying across the map
The freeze in air is like botw legend of Zelda freeze abilities where his teamate was punching him making him basically get punched 100 times
I actually wanna see a character that can yeet friend and foe.
You used to be able to launch like that from the crates in like s1-s2
Nah man he just  Has really bad internet and a really good gaming chair
I just started playing Apex on PC and I'm unsure on what sensitivity to use, can someone tell me the best
Man using stasis+
That press R to report button looks fine rn
LoZ BotW stasis:
Insane  aimbot yet he still can't beem
BRO ITS LIKE THAT ONE STAND FROM JOJO
It's season 0 all over again
Considering I don’t own apex, no, I have not
No this man was playing titan fall with the smart pistol
Bro I swear that’s the Zelda little freeze thing
S3 : floatting+invinit_lazer on charge rifle
Sub to v1nce and join the Republic failure to join will results in Mass War and the casualties of PNG tuber fans!!
Pubg be like: You new?
999 comments? Let me fix that.
This is actually a valk on controller
When warzone player come on apex
Dang
Pc lobbies bruh
Well I would just wait until round 3 then fling the bastard
He Flys then he get punched
Bruh that punch momentum cheat is an actual jojo reference 💀
Never seen those cannon cheats,although does his team mate have like super knockback? He punched him like 10 times and it launches him flaf way accross the map
Idk why game developers don't just make it so that when people are caught cheating it makes the experience living hell for that user, emotional damage is way better than a banned account and a few bucks lost. They will believe that cheating isn't worth it, and it should get Cheaters to stop. Unless they are a masochist.
he isn’t cheating he just has the smart pistol
Reminds me of whe. U would punch a loot bin and jump of of it.
Cheating is fkn boring
When he first flew and the music started playing i lost it 😂
This is cross play should have been between xbox and ps
The first one locks him in places so they can stack momentum to launch him
Niggas is playing minecraft
He's cheating! But that's really... fascinating...
This cheat works like a glitch that was around back in season 1-2 where if you crouched inside of a loot crate and punched certain areas of it and the jumped it would skyrocket you across the map
ohhhh the punch fly cheat is something from modern warfare 3 people used to use it for infection or just customs it was fun getting out of the map and looking around for stuff
That looks very similar to the exploit you, at least used to (don't know if it was patched), could do where you punch the underside of lids of the random containers then jump onto the top and get launched.
Lmao ppl using cheats aren't really gamers that have no skill what losers
See free fire you can't never guess what's going on
Mfer can't even tap strafe
Most of the cheat users in the game were Chinese...God damn it
The one where he floats and his team mate punches him to send him flying actually used to be a glitch you could do with the loot crates, you would open up the crate, punch the lid of it, the angle at which you punched it and the amount you punched it affected your trajectory when you got on the lid and simply jumped, i used to use it to cross the map in seconds
The launch is for the OG like me. It was a supply bin glitch that launched you when you punched it enough. The more you punch the farther you go
as a person who has cheated on apex i can definitely say that the anti cheat is super ass
Hatte ich auchmal nur ist er in der Luft geblieben und hat dann mit dem Elektogewehr Permanent geschossen ohne Pause dazwischen 😂
Hes not cheating hes just got a really good gaming chair
This looks like the glitch they had with the loot boxes on the map. Can't remember exactly how it went but it involved punching like they did.
The first one is no clip
Hes not hacking thats just what good aim and movement looks like. Get good noobs
The shieldswap is pretty old tho.
Hackers the only reason i dont wanna get apex on pc
I would have loved if he got return to battled
If pain were added to the game
Bro not ADS-ing. Ahh reminds me of Titanfall 2
All you’re doing is glorifying cheating when you post shit like this....
I saw some shit like that way back in season 1
That's just the smart pistol
The cheats I saw were the death box and floating thing, that "aim bot" was luck with a sniper and spray control both are much needed in the FPS genre.
Alternate title cheater gets fisted midair and goes flying.
I can see why hackers have fun with stuff like this 💀😭
This man’s playing Breath of the Wild
You use to do something like this with chest or something in the early days of apex
I've seen the floating one once and the guy was actually on my team, pretty sad he used a couple hacks but we still won.
Ok, play that game, but next time pls don't show up in my utub recommendations
The flying part makes me think of that time where you would punch lootboxes and they would launch you
Nah that looks like the smart pistol update
Who remembers punching loot bin lids and launching across the map?
There are hacker in valorant to
My man playing legend of Zelda
I remember back in the apex preseason there was a glitch where if you got inside a loot crate and punched it, the loot crate would store up all of the momentum from the punches and would just launch you across the map. Mr and my friends had one game where we did this to two boxes and whilst in a firefight we would jump in and out of the combat using the boxes. Shit was hilarious but got patched in season 1.
It’s like the lock from Zelda breath of the wild
Somebody needs to make a cheat that disables the Out of Bounds counter. Obviously cheating is bad but it would be funny
dont u know tufi, he has this cheats since s10 worlds edge
Apex with botw stasis?
He got the GTA4 moon jump cheat code on... 😂😂😂
The "yeet" cheat
Hope you band him
He freezes himself in the air and his friend punches him Bc when u punch someone they get pushed so he freezes gets punched a lot unfreezes it all registers flinging him very far
this reminds me of an old trick you could do with a teleporter in TF2
Better chair and mouse pad than you bruh
Aaand this what happens when warzone players switch to the next kind of game
The interstellar song 😭
My god their evolving
Air stuck/ Auto loot
It's like stasis in botw or smth WTF
Do you people forget that you could do the first cheat with the pill boxes back in like season 3
What kind of nen ability is this
It's a bug ..........
This is a really old source engine bug it's really easy to recreate in games like team fortress.
He's just good at the game
That’ll be sick if it was official. If only the devs cared though
It is a momentum stop and store cheat
I just ran across this. I’ve got a video of it. The guy was using the charge rifle and when he’d fire it was a never ending beam unless he wanted to stop it. He’d sit up in the air like that and just laser people to death. It was crazy.
I've had a whole team kill me from within a solid wall
Bro playing life on god mode
This mf played Legends of Zelda
You should put the illuminate meme when he would float like that and fly🤣
Fortnite hackers be like been there done that
The punch jump is a glitch not a cheat. You have to use a Crate and a teamate
900
Bro wtf
It seems like the flying thing is based on the same mechanic as the punching boxes bug back in the day
What is even the point of playing
Bro got botw stasis perk
It’s just like the punch loot bin bug that would launch you acrosss the map back in the early days of apex legends
Man is somehow cheating and using a bug, dude punches him and it builds momentum to launch himself
I have made a conclusion that he is not cheating
Activision peabrain again, they never actually focus on other games, just their stupid call of duty, which somehow exists in 40k
He just has a really good gaming chair
There was a glitch to have your friend fly by punching them when the game first came out if I remember
That interstellar music ❤️
Go deeper and research. Don't use the keywords Cheat.. try unethical hacks
The flying one seems like some form of suspended knockback, teammate punches him and builds up knockback and then releases it to fly
Bro, instant shield swap should be an actual option
Legend of Zelda breath of the wild
he turned on creative mode
Yeah, show the kids the fun of cheating. There wont come more if you do so. Great idea...
It’s called Lastcheats, look it up
Is it really a cheat tho?
Its a floater
Nah bros just lagging
Literally disgusting…
I Hate that pc players are so toxic now adays simply because you suck A$$ at the game you need to download cheats to ruin the game for people who actually spend time and hours perfecting there aim  And I'm sure they feel great sleeping at night knowing they won their games using cheats fking scumbags I miss 05-08 area when we could play fps without worrying about cheaters being in your lobby
1st one is flying and pausing knockback that's why when he turns it off he flys
The launching just could be the floating cheat collapsing because he's getting hit on a specific position, but I'm a console player so don't take what I said as truth
I made the client
Nah bro he's not cheating he has a good gaming carpet
If i get killed by a flying legend then I aint even mad. But fuck valkyrie
Dude has the shieka slate from botw
Bro doesn’t watch Dr pepp3r :(
my man had the stasis module from zelda breath of the wild
So he basically just got the smart pistol from titan fall
The stasis hack is straight outta LOZ BOTW
Bro he doesn't have aimbot he was using the smart pistol from titan fall
That's not a cheat, that's simply a bug
Flatline is popping off bro
Why when he is flying is there the End music pack from Fortnite 🤔
The fly cheat is like the old glitch where u punch a pill and climb on top then jump and it sends you flying. The reason is that the momentum of the punch is built in an Inanimate object causing any animate object that touches it to go flying
Dud the guy probably just played a lot of breath of the wild
Its not that crazy knowing cheaters can duel wield now.
That is like a stand ability, it freezes him and the knockback doesnt leave so he gets launched
Decode my story:💪👈🤔☝️👊👊👊👊🤜🤛👍
Reminds me of early Apex where you could hop into a loot crate and spam punch against the hinges while holding w and then jump after a few punches, which would make you fly insane distances.
Imagine that hack with a horizon that'd be busted
It's the smart pistol obviously
literally this is in everycheat the second is just a auto looter that picks ups shields with the highest shield level
Should I still play this game even tho there's hackers?
Your color settings please post it
speedrunning Bangalore go brrrrrr
I have seen the looting but that other one was weird.
Nah that's just the smart pistol  and he's bringing back an old glich
Imagine if the old punch 30seconds a bin and than jump to fly gets back but now you have to like disconnect your wifi teammate has to punch you and than you recommect and jump and fly
If theres an hack menu just with that one hack I wouldve gotten it. Just to fly around and die.
For a second I thought the dude was no-clipping
Jesus loves u and died on the cross for our sins and he is our lord and savior.
must be fun as heck
That’s annoying but cool
Never seen the first one but the second one is very common
He's not cheating, he just bought the battle pass.
That’s an old glitch, I remember ppl punching loot crates then open em or something an you get launched
THEY FLY NOW  They fly now
I'm curious on how he freezes himself midair, the launch is pretty explainable;he's storing momentum by freezing then he unfreeze and all that built up momentum sends him flying
Nah he just got the smart pistol
That should be a ultimate
I Had a cheater it was a lifeline using akimbo mozambique and literally no cliping and infinite mozambique here voicelines
I dont think that first one is a cheat, i think its an exploit or maybe a combination of both. Back in beta and season 1 you could do this by punching the underneath of the top of a pill box while its open and then jumping on it
Imma name this cheat "touch my butt and I go flying
Apex is trash, just another mainstream battle royale, back in the first 4 seasons the game was actually fun to play
The flying launching one used to be a really fun glitch in S0 with supply bins. There was a certain supply bin that you would stand on, and punch the bin in the direction you want to go. The more you punch, the faster/further you go! Then stand on the bin and press jump and boom your flying like 1000 metres
it's like when you could punch a supply bin and then it'd launch you
The cheat where he goes flying might relate to an old bug where, if you punch the lid of a supply crate then jump on it you could go flying.
Bro man just got stasis from Botw
He’s literally just playing Zelda. Or it’s a JoJo reference.
Literally the hack of flying when he punch him literally is like Breath of the wild mechanic XD
Holy shit. That's one of the oldest tricks in the book. You see, Apex is built on the Source engine, like Half Life 2, CSGO, and Gmod.   In Source people discovered that if you can somehow freeze in place, and then apply force to yourself, the force will save up and be released whenever you're unfrozen.   In a lot of modes on Gmod, and in other source games, you can apply force by hitting people with certain tools. Normally that would knock back the player, but when frozen it basically tallies all the force together and then sends you real good when you unfreeze.  We used to do this in some RP servers in Gmod where people would sit on someone's head, (using an animation freezes you in place), and then everyone would shove them from below for a minute. Them stand up, and you launch.  We called it Space Programming people.
I think the flying might be on a glitch with one of his hacks
The launch looks like Legends of Zelda stasis
R6 Cheaters: *”You haven’t seen SHIT.”*
Can you play with me in apex ???
I don't see a problem with the freeze launch, because it just looks like fun and I don't see how it could give any unfair advantages in an active firefight
The one where he can “fly” by his teammate punching him isn’t a cheat it’s a movement glitch. There’s alot of videos on it but idk about the other ones in the video.
Hah he has the old loot crate bug as a hack that's pretty good.
Man is his own gravity  canon😅
Nah he's not cheating bro, he was just using a smart pistol
That high fly is a jojo reference
/gamemode creative
Homie flys like “I ain’t vibe with this map”
The first one is like a stacis launch
He unlocked Stasis. 🔒
Mf ASCENDED
This cheat feels like normal. Atleast it's not autoaim or super speed
I dont remember which game was it... Wait it's the exact same concept as the loot bin glitch that was in apex in the early days. When you could punch a bin to build kinetic energy and just let it all go at the same moment and fly away
Damn that punching while floating thing is like the bug in season 3 i think when you punched inside a loot bin and then you put a jump pad on it and it would send you flying
There's an old school glitch where you could do something similar. But with the loot crates
Nah bro he just has good lag
He's got a good gameing chair
I think this is a cheat were in the game thinks you are lagging so with your team punching you it knocks you back but since you are "lagging" mid air the knock back accumulates which is them release sending him flying and since it has cause of happening it doesn't get detected for cheating but instead filed as "lagging".
Nah he just had the smart pistol
is this gameplay of breath of the wild??
It’s getting this bad on console as well, tbh why I took a multi season break from apex
I had them
Thats some breath of the wild shit right there
I want the battle pass
Still not as demonic as the cheats for mobile.
I want the battle pass pls
Octane rn: wtf
The launch glitch might not be a cheat but a glitch bug… with the gear grabbing cheat he’d have to do a constant check on the game. Now with how pathfinder works he probably glitches the grapple into a no clip bug that allows him to just not take damage after boosting off his teamate?
I remember back in like season 9 I believe there was an issue with hackers using this cheat along with a charge rifle. They would fly high up and use aimbot to literally beam people from the heavens
Nah that first one was just the smart pistol thats all
name of the song used when the guy first started to float.
Csgo
I think i was in a team with him
Just has a better gaming chair 💺 quit hatin      Jk
Nah mate that’s just the smart pistol
Angry birds apex edition
Apex legends fucking sucks
He probably made those 2, impressive yet ultra scummy.
Ok that's actually kinda awesome
gduffield
The cheat is litterally like the fight scene between Sale/Kraft Work VS Mista/Sex Pistols from jojo part 5
It builds knock back gmod style
that momentum punch thing can also be found in other source games specifically TF2, where if a Pyro/Engineer gets stuck and takes self damage can get flung once released
Yep arenas and he for some reason sent the link to the cheats I found it quite a boring and annoying game
Difference between hackers and modders
I spam report like 100 times but he didn't get ban
Bro got a co-op cheat
Ooo that brothers floating in the air
That launch hack is just like what you can do to the seeker in Gmod hide and seek
The float one is just fly hacks. He gets his team mate to punch him so it seems like a glitch
So it's kinda like the old octane and loot bin glitch
Valk mains dream of that air time
I wanna hack now
Ban plus report lol
Kinda like breath of the wild
This is why we should remove aim assist smh
I know them but the punching one is just like the box Jumping in the past, I usually see octane doing the hack though
the first one is like the old minecraft glitch
Na controller with glitches bro and you dont see the body shields man you going crazy
Fellas, if you have to use hacks to win...I've already said what needed to be said
I’m not even mad I’m actually more intrigued than anything
This guy has a cheat that makes him never lose shield health just as long as shields are around. He basically already infinite shields and he still installed an aimbot. This just shows how terrible this guy is. 🤣
Basically he freezes himself in place his mate hits him then when he unfreezes all the knock backs hit at once sending him flying
I want to try cheats but not at the same time
Weeee
He's just got good aim
The punch or “flying”? Cheat reminds me of the old bug with pills where you could punch them and then open to gain momentum and get launched
nah he just got the smart pistol in the first clip
What kind of Source engine velocity magic is this?
Yeah that octane was me
Perfect interstellar music timing
Not cheating. He just has a really REALLY good gaming chair.
The fly sort of cheat reminds me of the old crate glitch whrre if you punched it and jumps Don it you went flying
Oh it’s like breath of the wild with satis
Bro had ascended
Man has the mobile version of the bin glitch from years ago
He was using knock back that’s why his friend had to punch him in the air I remember that from modded mw3 custom lobbies 😂
The Launch Cheat looks to be inspired by Zelda: Breath of the Wild
That height hack is similar to the supply bin jump glitch
If I was to cheat I'd use that floating one but not to actually get an edge just so I can fuck around and get to high places
They are playing BoTW in apex
Can't lie that's both funny and just amazing
Mans playin zelda ong
Apex has had glitches like that where if you punched an opened crate for a while, stood on top of it, and jumped you'd be sent to outer space. I miss the old days when respawn was lazy
It kinda looks like the old loot bin trick
This isn't breath of the wild
He freezes in a fix and the punch builds up momentum
I think the cheat where it flings him brings back the old loot bin glitch where you'd punch it and jump off of it and go flying.
It's just no clipping
imagine this hack with horizon
That seems pretty simple for each one
EA Support is so cool
I think he’s just doing that thing in Breath Of The Wild with stasis and rocks, hitting it and building up force to launch himself in a direction
That ain't no cheat, that's his stand, KRAFTWERK.
This is how my enemys be like
Cheaters suck
Comment
the only weird thing is the likes hwving 69k
69 k likes nise
I’m not even mad about those cheats that’s just funny
That first one is basically valk… the most annoying legend
This is called "Airstuck", it puts your Movement on Freeze, if someone Hit you 10 Times  and turns it off all the 10 Hits with the Knockback come at once and put you in the Air
All these kids call everything cheats. But it's most exploits
I want a cheater who just uses that first cheat lol
In codm a hacker gave everyone infinite health, ergo you couldn’t die in the final circle or win so the only way out of the match was to quit, which meant losing xp
Literally like the Stasis power in TLoZ:BotW
nooooo don’t tell me this is back again
The one where he gets hit in the air is a glitch
Props to the dude to use an injector instead of a pre built script
Okay, i get cheating is bad, bad that is actually really cool. Botw style shit
That moment when his teammate punches him and that launches him into air. So, basicly, he he removes ability to get any force on him, locking in a mid-jump. Also he can save the force (Knockback) that can be stacked, then break the lock and all stacked knockback instantly hits him... There is no way this is a jojo reference right?..
What if it wasn't a cheat but a glitch or bug
The first one is called Air-Stuck and the second one idk
There is a difference between “cheats” and exploits.  Learn that.
The aimbot is ghey, but the one where you freeze in time looks pretty fun and crazy.
bro this is literally link’s stasis ability from zelda
I want the battle pass
So he is a Better Valk/Loba
My friend hacks(i dont play alex with him) and he said thats a new one
It's the same principle as punching an open loot container then jumping on it.  If you never tried it when it wasn't patched, it yeets you
Oh looks like no clip
it reminds me of that like kinetic energy big with octanes jump pad from a long time ago where you could put it on a pill punch the pill and launch yourself really far away
"I don't want the Battle Pass"
I can actually somewhat explain the flying hack he was doing. He starts off by "lagging" himself to where he's sending no packets to the server to tell how he's moving. Then his buddy starts hitting him so he can start "saving" some of those packets. Then in a singular moment he sends them all to the server at once tricking it into thinking it's all of the missing ones that were lost(this is a barbone lag compensation system) thus launching him. This is what causes rubber banding agent your actually lagging but a very controlled version
would have been cool if the Path grappled to the cheater
Like why cheat its so boring
wasnt there a stand in jjba that worked like that?
Apex got an airstuck, that is very cool.
The cheaters are just kids who cant play the game normaly bc the hackers bad at the game and dont want to practice just installing some cheat programs or a virus xd
I’m don’t support cheating but that launching cheat is actually pretty cool
A normal day in honk Kong server
Nah bruh that’s just skill
the 1st one was lagswitch i think
that’s just botw link using his stasis lmfao
My man has stasis from breath of the wild
Just like every streamer
I have seen auto looting death box's but not the other one. It reminds me of the loot crate glitch witch works the same way.
My friend did that to
If that were me I’d just be flying around and giving stuff too people and kill my self when there is only one team left
When the hacker got momentum from his teammate punching him kinda references about an old glitch with the loot bins back in season 1 or 2
Yo wtf, apex turned into Zelda botw game really quick, that link's ability tho 🥶🥶🥶  Btw, i want battlepass
Dude no clipping in apex.
I’ve seen the shield swap cheat but not the punch momentum one
I run into aim bots
He's definitely hacking for fun. Oh right uh no he's using his really good gaming chair just for fun.
I'm on switch apex, I was gonna play cross play off but apparently NOBODY plays on switch, so if I encounter anyone with a slight hack, I'm D O O O M E D
That freeze cheat surely is inspired with stasis from legend of zelda
“My planet needs me”
He would've made better use of the knockback accumulated if he knew how to strafe
Never
It's stasis from botw
Smartpistol users
"I want the battle pass"
He clearly has a really good gaming chair is sll
It is a kind of stasis cheat where as you saw they froze in the air which halts everything until it gets turned off which applies everything that happened before to the cheater in an instant
No he’s just better
BREATH OF THE WILD LOL!!!
Psilent aim spread, and stuck air cheat
Naw bro wasnt hacking he was just uhhhh lagging uhhh and he found the smart pistol attachment 👍
Man has stasis from botw
"he just had good gamer chair"
That cheat reminds me of the loot crates glitch where you used to punch the loot box and it would take all the energy from ur punch then u touch the loot crate and it launches u
Hmmm
Cheater: “ hey guy come punch me “ random “ um sure why, wait why aren’t you moving “ cheater: “ AHHH LOOK WHAT YOU DID “ flies into the sky
The ability to get launched makes him a part 5 jojo villain
That punching cheat is kinda like how back then you could launch across map by getting in a loot crate and punching
So the first one is packets holding He is holding packets so that none of them register and storing the velocity from the punches his teammate is doing,  then he releases all that stored velocity in an instant and it gives him a massive boost
The launch one is  a legend of zelda reference
This like old cod cheats
I think it’s a glitch with the launch thing and he probably just can armour swap quick not to mention at the start he missed like 3-5 shots
When I was younger I use to hack combat arms then modded but eventually lost the knowledge on how (seizures) but I remember the terms;  Floating= hover all your doing is changing an axis while walking so you fly  See through walls = chams, you could change texture pack between cover and non cover  Insta kill- one bullet/knife stab/melee attack kill   Tela kill- teleports a insta kill to random or nearest person  Phase through objects - ghost mode (has 2 different ones though one keeps your avatar still on other players screen while on yours you run around killing people)  Aimbot - lock on aiming kinda like how itztimmy plays but with 0% of missing. It's Timmy can shoot a house and with aimbot it would shoot the nearest person in his avatar viewable range even twisting 720' to make the shot.   God mode- immortal  Akimbo is new
Wtf is this botw now?
Ngl I want the stasis thing to be a new game mode, like one persons invincible but cant their attacks dont hurt anyone and the other can only move via being hit in a direction
Wow mesa prime
i think he are hacking the mfking systems or sth
Maby his lag is so good or is it bad 😂 🤣 😂 that it just works
I don't see the point in this hack when no clip is a thing
Man's got breath of the wild hacks
The jump is straight out of zelda
The freeze cheat is like playing a vr game pausing time with a mod then punching a guy 500 times then start time and he goes flying like you punched him 500 times at one time
It's the care package launch glitch!
probably builds momentum from the punches
It looks like its knockback stacking the punches from his teammate thats so weird
I remember that punching thing back in like season 1 (maybe season 0 idk). I think you had to punch an open crate and then stand on it. Hilarious glitch
airstuck isnt fixed in apex lul
This vid is literally the whole reason I don’t play apex dude is openly hacking and still takes 45 min of shooting to kill two people hellll nah Bru
That guy just want to vibe
Dude! This guy has Zelda stasis!
Imagine being so bad at a game you have to cheat to win if your not good at it put it down and play something else why ruin it for other people
Have seen it. Has been around a lot
Thought they patched that lol like back then u can do that with the crates tho it was a glitch i even did it i flew across the map with it lol
Hes floating its a floater
Breath of the wild moment lol
Yes I've used em😂
That's a Jojo reference
I have never saw a cheater in Apex XD
Wow and warzone has an anti cheat yet Apex Legends doesn't yet for some reason Apex Legends was more popular than modern warfare like what the actual f
I did had an encounter with the levitating cheater once. He used bloodhound and jumped on my octane pad. I aimed at him and i was anticipating him falling down and he never came down. Also, he used charge rifle with aimbot.
The first one is a source engine cheat called airstuck, honestly surprised to see it not fixed in apex by default. Basically, all it does is refuse to tell the server to let the player move, only just sending enough to keep you connected. The server has no idea what to do so it just freezes you in place, but knockback can still change your speed which all gets applied as soon as the cheat is turned off.
Kind reminds me of gmod hide and seek
I have seen the flying one
Look like some tarkov hacks
Cheating is actually fun asf. All you babies cry about it when you get killed. Just rescan and que another game wasting your time being mediocre lol. I’m not spending the time to get good a     Video game and waste my life away. Cheating is a blast lol.
That launch hack reminded me of tf2, teleportation stuck xd
Same energy as using a fishing rod on the bosses of battle towers in Minecraft
The flying one is not a cheat he is using a glitch from super mario
Honestly the launching into the air thing would be something i would use in like the range or something just to fly around
I just started playing apex  so i have never seen an Hacker
Breath of the wild: Apex
Lol
First i know already that cheat its called idk when he freeze and punch the kinetic energy store it inside and if unfreeze the whole energy inside push the hacker into the map
Yeah i ran into the akimbo hack a while a back. Then the charge rifle one
The dude floating then flying is a lot like in botw, where if you hit an object in “stasis” and then goes flying sometimes with you on it
Bro just went to creative mode
No clip and god mode those are old school scrips
I'm gonna be honest. If the cheater utilized this in a way to launch him literally into an enemy with no weapons just a mach speed melee. I wouldn't complain and would be the funniest shit ever
Not cheats but the punching to launch Is fairly similar to a glitch back before season one on console where if you opened a loot box punched the Inside of the lid a few times then jump  on the lid and jump at the right spot and it would send you flying....the more you punched the lid the further you would fly
I've seen these cheats from Apryze, just look up Avoxia Gaming hackers and youll see this
My man's got that Zelda Stasis cheat Jesus. Also, he didn't realise the dude is literally splitting bullets lol
The silent aim or was so obvious
😧
So the first unknown exploit was himself to freeze and his friend to punch him to stack knockbacks that can turn yourself into a cannon
That freeze cheat just abuses Melee Knockback mechanics
Bro legit asked jesus for his powers
The good old days when you get to use the loot chest as launch pads to free fly insanely high.
OP: says guy is using ambot "Cheater": Proceeds to miss most of his shots
Can’t wait till they do the same thing as cod and troll cheaters because this is just sad
This guy missed the loot bin flying glitch so much he hacked it himself
I’m pretty sure that super jump things just an exploit, I’ve seen someone do it and I think it only works on pathfinder
Imma take a wild guess that hes playing windowed, and hes holding click on the X, then he moves his mouse away and releasing cancelling the closing application making him resume connection? Im onlu guessing this cus you could do similiar cheats in other games like walking through solid walls if you held W while doing it.
The only cheaters I know use aim assist and controller. :)
That kind of reminds me of the old loot box glitch, You would punch the lid of an open loot box over and over then when you jumped on it it would fling you for miles depending on how many times you punched it, something about how the engine works.
His teammate has super punch
Who knew that getting punched forces you into a different direction.  Oh wait I played Halo.
I hope he finds a cheater who steals his account
It's just the smart pistol 😩😩
I think he can change into a Ragdoll and if your in the air as Ragdoll you build up Speed or momentum (however you wanna call it) by punching.
First one is just slow-mo cheat. Its literally same as the zipline infinite charge rifle cheat.
Smart pistol from titan fall
"I want the battle pass"
I’ve seen the instant loot one but not the floating one
He isn't cheating, he just has a really good gaming chair
These kind of cheats aren’t really sold unless you actually want a virus. Most of the time people code there own and never release to the public. I coded a few but never sold or used for online use. Training and private matches. It was a test to see how shit the anticheat is and how easy it is to code your own cheats.
The auto loot mod is called auto armor swap
Everyday
PC again no dout its players like this that make it bad for other gamers and there own players but gamers pull away from game as it's none enjoyable to play
Looks like airstuck from csgo
My man got the smart pistol
Imma nickname it 'Grave Robber'
I've seen the floating one in arenas before. Fucker was just floating with a charge rifle cheat too.
Today in asia tokyo server, I saw spitfire akimbo with infinite ammo. His teammate had devoution akimbo with infinite ammo. Both were like fu king  Anti aircraft turrets.
Mans using arts and crafts on himself
the one he pauses mid air and gets punched is is he’s stacking up all that knock back and the one he unpauses is he gets all that knock back at once and it sends them flying
Bro that's a weird way to code a cheat hahah....unless he just got then off the net....
And these people go round thinking there the best at the game when without cheats your trash
When you write your own cheats:
This is impressive I'm amazed cheaters !
He stops time for you and everytime you punch someone he gets knocked back and he Hits you a lot
That music made me laugh so hard😂
Bruh ive seen cheater using double wingman and shoot both of them at the same time
"Prepares to be God"
Pro player
Lol
Thats a glitch
That jump cheat is something similar to something I’ve seen back in MW3. On a modded map you’d crouch below them and shoot their head with a shotty and they’d launch out of map it was pretty fun/cool
Actually I saw levitation bugs and when you get punched you fly away, but I have never seen the first part being done by force
I've seen the first one since late 2021
I have a theory the flying cheat is just it stops you in the air and all the momentum he gets from heroin punched him releases at one time and send him flying
Intersteller music made it better
Bro legends of Zelda (cause the dude has to hit him for it to fly like Zelda)
Ngl thats really sick
Gta?
It's like stasis in SMO
That’s just unique
I've seen the floating one before
the flying cheat is like the zelda ability to freeeze sometging and have all the knockback to take effect at once
I've seen one hacker in apex out of 600+ games
Apex: Breath of the Wild Edition
There was glitch like this if you punched the inside of a bin and stood on it you went flying
“It’s a floater “
That's actually sickening, there better be anti cheat for this shit cos I ain't havin this
Having fun wit it
Hey if your a season 0 vet like me you definitely remember the ever so fun glitch with crates where you punch them the insides of them and you went flying so much fun while it lasted
Ok the floating Cheat works by taking advantage of a glitch and of course that glitch is if your mate is let’s say do you have a lag spike you can punch them a bunch and then when the punches finally hit them to end up getting knocked further than what they should at least that’s what I guess🐟.
the punch fly thing reminds me of an old glitch in apex where punching a supply crate over and over again then jumping on it would send you flying
if the hacker does the air cheat with horizon that would be a lot of air control
Nobody likes cheaters.....
Reminds me of the old elevator glitches from MW2
Okay I'm not going to lie he is hacking like you can obviously see that but that used to be a glitch to where you if you get stuck on a loot box your teammate constantly hit you in a few hit jump a certain way while looking the way you want to go it'll launch you
Seems so fun to cheat in games especially if it’s just stupid shit and not using it to actually get a better advantage or something
How we do know your not the cheaters. Yeah I know how that sounds. But ppl do strange things
It reminds me of Legend of Zelda speed running, cuz if I recall correctly (hopefully) in one of the games you can like, lock objects in place, hit them several times and unfreeze them, and it launches them in the direction so fast, people used it to travel around quickly. I might be wrong of course but I think I've seen it
Big brain cheater
So air stuck is back sort of
The 2st one could just be a lag switch
That hack to go super high was kinda like how you used to be able to do that with supply bins in the beginning days of apex
Must be using a Cronus, no chance he’s cheating.
He freezes himself and then his teamate hits him repeatedly and he then let's go
Fact his teammate was helping him 😐
This is why I don't play apex no more
Not even playing Horizon smh
So they basically brought back the supply crate glitch as a hack. Ngl I'd just be impressed if I saw a hacker only using that
The Insta db loot I've seen before in a gaming merchant vid he was spectating a hacker
Funny thing is ppl complain about warzone having cheaters/hackers but look at apex
One time I saw a wraith running around at mach eleven with aimbit wall hacks and I'm instant loots
Yeah cheats are getting out of hand
I found out his teammate was hacking too, he has a video on youtube labeled pathfinder new passive with him blatantly cheating on it.
“To infinity AND BEYOND”
hey, it's a cheat feature called airstuck, it exists in basically every source engine game.
They're basically playing Breath of the Wild
Is there one where the entire lobby gets slowed in time. because that’s happened twice to me
He needs to lower the fov on his aimbot because it’s targeting other people
“I want the battle pass”
Hacks are so interesting bro like they go crazy
Omfg…
I got a clip of a bang who had aimbot with their smoke launchers
I feel like I am playing with aimbot players in this game ,cause this game has lots of guns with recoil and when they far away they never miss
How didn't he take fall damage?
The first cheat was like a glitch back in season 2 of apex that whenever you were to go inside of a lootcrate and your teammate punched it you would go flying. I'm guessing this one though is using freeze frames I believe.
I want the battle pass
Its a floater
I saw ur channel 2 years ago and u had only 300 subs and I was subbed for like a month then forgot abt you but now I see your new video and you have 18000 subs!!
He just had the new gfuel where u have to snort it up ur nose
If you used to play apex like season 1 or 2 there was some glitch where you’d be frozen and if your friend psyched the shit out of you when you unfreeze you’d go flying, he’s probably an kg that misses old bugs lmao
Fake
That's just the OG loot bin boost coming back to haunt us
Obviously it was because he had a better gaming chair
I thought a stasis from breath of the wild and I’ve never played it
That's absolutely wild. When he freezes his teammate punches him so he builds momentum. And he unfreezes to release him
Reminds me of the old glitch where you could be the shit out of a supply bin and fly
at that point hes doing it cuz hes bored and wants to meme
When did smart pistol got added to Apex?
This is similar to cheats I've seen on Rust. Rust uses Easy Anti-Cheat, just like Apex. EAC needs to step up their cheat detection, from a programming perspective, this should be easy to detect.
Man's using stasis on himself
So there is smth similar in minecraft. You minimize the game and then hold the tab. You are practically frozen for that time but inputs will be stacked after unfrozen
He is acceding
Breath of the wild taking notes on that freeze hit cheat.
I think the flying thing actually uses the punches from the teammate to launch him. I think he is basically freezing his game, and exploiting the knock back from the punches and adds them together for the launch. It also might multiply them a bit. It also looked like it took less time to move the first time so it is likely like a 4 times multiplier for the punching. I am not 100% sure, but I hate cheaters in general so I find this sort of thing interesting. Kind of odd how the battle royals like apex and warzone have the most cheaters
His jump hack or whatever reminded me of when you could punch the loot boxes to stack knockback and then if you jumped off the top it would throw you across the map
The first one isn't really a cheat, it's called the freeze boost jump. You are able to do it in a lot of games
The punching and getting launched is because you can build momentum off the consecutive punches being hit with which is weird since it should reset after every hit so this is very concerning considering they built apex off of titanfall 2’s everything and look at the state of that game and what happened..
I use a config in apex mobile and it has aimbot magic bullet 90 fps and wallhacks
I didn't know they added botw to apex
That's actually really cool
Dude u ran into me noice
I’ve seen cheats like that but it wouldn’t be detectable
Don’t worry it’s just the nerfed jump pad, you can’t jump without a teammate now.
The throwing him up in the air is like the crate glitch back in the day
I got killed by a teleporting aimboter
He has a smart pistol
Cool gaming chair 👍
How the boost hack works: if you are noclipped and your team mate keeps hitting you, it will multiply the boost from the punch, when he disables noclip, its as if he got boosted from 15 punches at the same exact time
This is just a better version of the trident and octane pad glitch
The looting one exploits loba black market code, the floating one likely leverages valk code
Bro 2022 is build different on apex legend
It's like the old supply bin punch boost launch
If apex gets a flying anti cheat he would be semi safe as his zooming around in the air would actaully count as being launched but his air freezing might be detected or sense he's really close to the ground it wouldn't pick it up
There is a game braking bug that make you  fly is actually a pathfinder doing it's the bug its all over YouTube
Nah he ain't cheating it's just his gaming chair
And this is why I don’t play apex
The flying thing remind me of g mod hide and seek
its actually impressive
Mostly i saw cheater with laser non stop while floating in the sky lmao
Why do most hackers use pathfinder?
Homie playing gmod
If he didn't have aimbot and the insta loot I'd let him be lol
When someone’s so tryhard at cheating that it’s 180s to being interesting
The only one I’ve ran into was the shield swap on command one. It’s like a personal Loba Black market. I was shooting this guy, in an up close battle off drop, and cracked his shield, seen some weird shield swap out in the open (no loot box near) and then he killed me. I was so confused how I cracked him and still kept hitting shield
The punch thing is possible but requires you to lower your internet to a rate that it doesnt disconnect but it lags alot and then when your Internet is better you get launched due to the punching
this is lastcheat.
At least they are having fun with it
How is that even allowed 💀
The fly cheat is actually the loot bin super jump glitch from way back when
This is actually so hard to obtain wow
The levitation cheat has been around for a while, cheaters used to combo it with the infinite charge rifle hack.
Just better
The original Hacker deserves credit its fenominal to watch
I believe the first "new" hack is speed packets, when someone stores momentum for later use, example being this, he was storing momentum till he released it all at once.
That word punch things probably to by pass fly anti cheat
It kinda just seems like glitches not hax
It’s just skill and movement bro
He is just really good
Nah that was just the smart pistol
theres 2 ways i can think of the launch thing not being hacks maybe just bugs, first way is f11 freezing it is when you press the white tab at the top of the window in the middle of an action and it freezes you and then once enough momentum is built up just stop holding the top of the window orrr just disconect ethernet and have no normal internet
“Have you ever seen cheats like this”  Me a console player: No, I don’t think I have
I play dbd I see this daily now💀😭
He just a good gaming chair
I've never seen a hacker in apex and I've played since season one so this is new to me lol
On free fire and we can talk about your YouTube career bit
Cheats are really rare to be fair
He is the one
This reminds me of the mw3 knockback hack with the shotguns😂
Wow he has early access to the smart pistol in apex!!!!
man airstuck and autoloot are standard on any good cheat nowadays
I've seen the floating cheat before, where people have used it just as humor within the game but not that punching them several times will send then flying lol
it’s funny cause i saw a tiktok from the paths perspective
Aceu had faced a cheater he had 4 arms 2 wingman at the right an ar at the left oh yeah it also had aimbot
Owa daym
Hoestly it might be a heck but at least it not crazy heck because the fact that he has to stand still and hover and get punch a bunch of times to build up power in my eyes it a heck but knowing respawn it could be a hidden bug or something lol heck you can teleport with valk ulit if you want 🤣
this is engi's feature in tf2 lol
Ive seen a guy yhat was cheating in ranked and his sight changed every time he aimed in
I want the battle pass
Breath of the wild stasis
You gotta imagine from their perspective, thinking like what has apex not patched yet , they only have so many options so if they made it and programmed the hack themselves then I mean there literally is only so many options of hacks they can actually use underneath the admins
Fuck it creative mode
Me seeing cheaters in Apex: meh Me seeing a dragon in Apex after not playing for so long: holy dragon
i know its cheating, and thats "bad", but that legit looks fun
When you get banned for cheating do they ban your IP address from playing or just the account?
The first one is just like stasis from Breath of the wild, and insta loot is just like a magnet that swaps out bad for good.
The launch thing is a lag switch it discounts you a for a minute and you punch to build up momentum my buddy would use it in arenas to get sent yo the other teams spawn and confuse the shit out of them
Activate god mode
Cheat for fun I guess
I want the battlepass
I thought that he was getting ctrolled by the hacker at first
alots
“I want the battle pass”
“How come I’ve never seen any of these hackers/cheaters” *runs into every battle headfirst guns blazing*
I've seen the insta shield swap cheat before
Seen that way too many times
airstuck ontop
botw statsis
Nah he ain't cheating with the RE-45, simply using the Smart Pistol from TF2
I want the battle pass
BRO ITS ALWAYS THE BANGALORES.
I know this doesn’t matter and no one asked (and no this isn’t criticism just a fun fact), but what he has was not aimbot, it’s called “ghost bullets” and basically the bullets hit anyone in the general direction you’re shooting at. That’s why the bullets sort of turned away to the guy when the cheater was shooting completely away. Aimbot is full on tracking the perfect movements of a head or body, ghost bullets is Aimbot but without needing to aim at the person
Mnk players be like: all of these hacks are not actually hacks... THEYRE AIM ASSIST
Holy shit when did the end of the smart pistol form Titanfall
BRUH IN INCORPORATED TLOZ Breath of the Wild mechanics into his hacks?!?!
I truly hate that some of you guys support watching Apex Hackers… like… how is that not the most boring and annoying content lmao   Not that I’m great but damn haha
U think that's bad? Me and my friend killed a guy and his team all of a sudden both our game crashes and when we tried to join back the lobby no longer existed. meaning this guy took such a L he stopped the whole lobby
Skill issue
If valkrie. And loba had a kid
Cheats in WZ: noooo he's aim hacking, slide canceling, no recoil, perked up hacks and macros!!! Raven do something!!!!   Cheaters in Apex: aye teamate, punch me 5x and I can fly across the map.  Teammate: aight bro...
How do you make your game look like that
Tick manipulation, it was a thing in CSGO basically it makes your ping go high for a select few seconds and then lies to the system on how fast they're actually going and where are they, seems like this a thing in every source based game :/
Am I missing a joke here? This guy isn’t cheating.
I feel that there are people who use minimal hacks like the insta armor swap and walls. I’ve seen people swap fast, but everyone now and again you fight a guy who swaps shields way too fast. Impossible.
Please before anyone play apex play titanfall 2 it’s way too underrated nowadays and I think everyone should enjoy it befor wapex
I won a killed weapon hacker in battlefield with a shotgun, it was in team death match, god it felt so good T-bagging him
Reminds me of breath of the wild
Nah he’s not cheating this is all skill.
This dude just play at creative mode
I have
I never saw a cheater in this game which is weird cus all my friends see it like a couple times a season
Hear me out horizon and the first hack absolutely broken
It's like the supply bin glitch from season 1
He's got a good gaming chair damn
It's seems like they've used the coding from the loot bins back when they were bugged when you punched them then got on top of the bin and tapped the jump button just from my experience of bugs in the game since day 1
Bro he has the supply bin glitch hack, that alone makes me consider cheating.
Ok ima havker on other games that floating hack is him storing movement pakets his teammate punches him and bc of the packets being stored so is the punch momentum and thus a grav cannon bost thing this might also work with a grav cannon
Instantly loot death boxes? No he didn't lmao
The momentum one is like the box glitch from early game and the shield on is just pc players. I mean hacks.
I've seen someone dual welding wingmans
I might start using cheats but my name will be I'mcheatingbtw
my man is in creative mode
Naw man he has a good gaming chair
Or just switch to console
The auto loot i have seen
He didn’t cheat... He began to believe 😎
Happens all the time on rust.
Bro I once lost a 1v1 in the final battle from the shield swap cheat
That looks so fun
Can i have the battle pass? Ive been playing for so long and wanting to have nice skins but too broke.
Man turn into god
“I want the battle pass”
Hes believing
That looks like an exploiter not hacker to me. (taking advantage of glitches)
Lol man just yeeted himself
What the frick naw this man a whole mother breed this more insane than kimboing
"Is this the power of a god?"
Played against a hacker in ranked the other day, man didn't loot armor immediately but I'm pretty sure you can choose what loot to get out of nearby boxes because every time he'd run past one you'd hear something being looted. And he had the bullet magnetism, but guy was an actual level 8, no alt account bull, his movement was garbage and I actually ended up almost killing him because he had to start shooting himself rather than the aimbot shooting for him. I'd peek him for a split second do a ton of damage then move before he could start shooting but he had teammates that weren't cheating and they ended up killing me instead of the cheater. They started throwing after realizing their teamate was a cheater tho.
Apex physics are so good, you have to collect kinetic energy by being punched If no clipping irl was possible this would be possible lol
Man has a bulit in gravity cannon
How to become Superman in 3 steps: 1. Freeze yourself in time 2. Let teammate(s) punch you for 10 seconds 3. Unfreeze yoursef
Have you seen a cheat in Apex legends that can do a double gun?
Man's playing Valkyrie without gas
nahh hes jus built different
I was laying in bed when I found out I don’t give a shit
Why do cheaters always pick bang i never see them play anything else
Silent aim, ESP,  Airstuck and instaloot
Yeah the floating ones been around for awhile but I haven't seen the sheild one.
Chill down, its just a good gaming chair.
You can also use valk ult and freeze in air, had a guy hold me hostage cause I couldn’t leave the ult
Why I will never play pc
Stop making apex hell for us please 😭
Reminds me of the old loot bin launch glitch
Seems like he was just bored with the game
the floating thing is not a glitch if you put apex into windows mode if you jump and right click the bar above your screen you will freeze mid air
The one were hes in the iar is called airstuck
Once i met a guy that spawned NPCs lol
Looks fun ngl
Dude man’s useing stasis from Zelda
The punch thing is using code from supply bin jumping by storing the momentum of a melee attack
he has a really good gaming chair hes not cheating
And he dares to have lofi as his clan tag. I'm so disappointed.
He curve balled the thermite
How to win games: Do what this man did
That some breath of the wild shit
Bro that's like the loot bin one
He replicated the loot crate launcher bug
What guns you use?
Nah bro its not aimbot he just has a smart pistol form titanfall 2
Oh sh*t I have that cheat but I play on Mobile
I want a battle pass
The flying hack looks like the bug where you fly off using bins
Built in octane pad I guess 😅
I have this
Ive been running into alot of teams that have auto switch sheilds
Bros got the stasis from breath of the wild
I think the hack is creating a sort of launcher
It's smart pistol 2.0
Nothing to see here just a controller player and Aim assist
The launching reminds me of legend of Zelda
That float punch hack is a remake of a glitch from earlier in the game where you would punch the underside of an open look crest and then climb on top of the box and you would get launched. It’s the same thing just with added air strafe speed
Is cold creative mod
Mistas getting flashbacks from his first stand Battle
Bro's got a smart pistol in apex
Man is playing the legend of Zelda
I feel like that first one was just for fun
That Interstellar music killed me🤣🤣🤣
Flyhacking will usually end with an instant gameban on any game though
I use those cheats
That’s actually a relatively convincing aim bot compared to other cheaters I’ve seen.
It's just the crate glitch remastered
When was the smart pistol added in apex
My first though was Link's ability when he mentioned that his teammate needs to punch him to fly while in "stasis" .
Just a good gaming chair
Botw stasis be like
It's normal in minecraft bedrock
I’ve seen a cheater dual wield
dude is an AC-130 but it has aimbot
I've been playing since before season 1 and I gusse I've been lucky but I've never ran into a cheater and yes I'm on pc useing keyboard and mouse and im kinda mad I haven't seen one yet
Remind me with zelda
Hey I’m just saying if someone only use that like super jump man launch in a actual match nothing else just that cheat I wouldn’t be mad at it I’d actually fucking laugh
Nah he just lagging
oh nah i see how he does it.  the freeze is to keep him there while his friend builds momentum with punching him making him launch
Yup me and him probably use the same cheats 🤣🤣🤣
I had a glitch on apex mobile getting unlimited health while using octane  Can u tell me why??
what you talkin bout that ain’t cheating he just got the smart pistol
There is exploit similar to this in CSGO, it's called airstuck I'm not sure how it works though. The only explanation I would have for this same concept but the velocity he gets from his teammate punching all comes at once when he turns it off
The freeze-punch-launch is a reference to żelaza games, there tou froze an object, you hitted it a bunch of Times and then unfroze it And launched it
"I want battle pass"  also subbed keep it up g
It’s very similar to supply bin jumping
I think it’s just that he has a good gaming keyboard
There is nothing more when it comes to video games that I hate more is hackers they are the fucking worst
DAMN
He just has a good gaming chair
Not as weird as the infinite boat rocket cheaters in fortnite.
I want the battle pass
Zelda type movement
You got to admit he is kind of creative
The only way u can see more is to come asia servers  TW,HK,Japan
I see legend of zelda speedrun/movement tactic thing
We like to do a bit of trolling
I think That's called no gravity
It’s a bug, I’ve done it, though the armor swap probably is cheats
Me seeing this: *That’s just a pro Titanfall 2 mobility god*
The floating air punching launching is just the source engine being the source engine
Bro got the smart pistol
oh look.  Apex in creative mode :D
I've seen the loot hack. Scary. Especially since cheaters always are trash so sometimes if you 3rd party them you can kill them sometimes. This makes it 2x as hard.
Zelda stasis
The punch looked like it was “storing” momentum or smth
Hackers are evolving
How is this fun for them lol that's so sad
Something interesting about the flying cheat is back in the day this was not a cheat but a glitch with the loot crates where if you punched one repeatedly you would build a ton of force on it then when you would jump on it, it would make you fly like in this glitch all the way across the map
Yeah I've seen it plenty of times, Cheat is called lastcheats, might be the premium or pro version. I pray you never run into someone using Project Kratios.  I mean I also cheat to so....
Lmao isn’t it just like the Zelda Breath of the Wild physics?!? You can stop an object in that game and shoot it or punch, then it will launch in self like a cannon ball. Honestly cheats makers are reaching new boarders of creativity. 🤣
yy
Yo that punching thingy is like what we do in minecraft on hypixel we give ourselfs a litle demage it disables the anti cheat and the we fly like 60bps(plocks per second)
He just has a good gaming chair obv
Warzone and apex switched anti cheats the only reason why there is cheaters in apex it also explains why warzone anti cheat dropped as soon as the highest rise of cheaters in apex was shown
This game now belongs to the hackers lmfaoo
I had a cheater like that just yesterday, he was just flying around and aimboting and wallhacking
That looks like some MW2 mods 😂😂
I want the battle pass
Average controller player
Not that impressive cuh spent 30$ for a modded account
I want the battle pas
The insta shield swap should be a feature or at least a passive for a new/reworked Legend IMHO
That’s a cool anti cheat
Seen a lot of instant looting and shield swap but flying hack!? Wtf now
Valk ult on steroids
This is the only time I don’t hate a cheater.
"I want the battle pass!" Thank you!
I ran into the same cheater in the same match as this haha
"I want the battlepass"
Damnn
Please can I have the battle pass
"I want the battle pass"
"I want the battle pass"
Cheaters are trash just speaking my mind lol
"I want the battle pass"
I want the battle pass not for me, but for my friend who isn't able to get it rn :) also, I saw some of the code for the airstuck cheat on reddit a few weeks ago.
"I want the battle pass"
Sounds less like a cheat and more like a glitch/physics exploit
Holy shit that is fascinating. It freezes him, then lets him build up momentum from the punch knockback and release it on command. That's pretty wacky man
No it’s laggggg
"I want battle pass"
bruh apex needs to a new anticheat xD
