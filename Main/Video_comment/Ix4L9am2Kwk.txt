Had to drop another lil boy for similar reasons. Bro, you jobless and live in your friend's basement. No ride, no structure, no clue. BYE BOI  Ladies, don't let some dude come into your space and tell you a damn thing about anything if they ain't got shit going on themselves. Shit's sad and too real.

Fanatic song. Doja at her best. Just like the song scrubs by TLC. Women are tired of me laying up, eating for free, and not bringing nothing to the table. Vice/versa. Doja is the new female sensation.

i can't find it on SPOTIFY I WANNA LISTEN TO HER MUSIC ALL DAY!!!!
😻😻😻😻😻
God is good and Jesus ...
Reimagined Elton John's Bennie and the Jets, and Frank Ocean's Super Rich Kids... 🔥 though!
Cool
Listen, as someone that totally gets what she's saying. Someone that can't express myself in that way because if I did it would be racism (even though I've been with a black man for almost two decades and honestly that's all I like is black men lol look white but Italian American in Spanish either way)  She literally laid it all out there, and I f****** love her! Like I said everything that so many of us women can't say, because it would not be right, she did it for us. And I got told by my husband (won't go into detail but let's just say that I have really dealt with some s*** that no good woman should ever have to deal with, and I'm tired of it) that I can't listen to that song, if I do basically I'm a racist. And then he tried to push my buttons and said I bet you want to sing the word. And I said nope I'm just grateful she's putting it out there, cuz it's exactly how I feel.  And then he kept saying ...say it I know you say it, say it.... Now if that isn't gaslighting I don't know what is.  So I never heard this song, but our 16 year old daughter wanted me to hear it, because she felt like it was something that i, as her mother needed to hear.  And my daughter is so wise, wiser  than anybody that I know because I definitely needed to hear this song.   I will continue to play the song, I will listen to it every damn day, because I deserve so much more, and so much better. I don't deserve to be abused in any type of way, I don't deserve to be alienated, to feel completely alone and unloved. I don't deserve to be a secondary to everything when I put everybody else first.  Anyways, sorry for all the blabbering! The song, it literally just pulled me out of a serious depression. A place where I hate going, but go often when I'm treated so damn horribly. Let's just say, something my grandma would say, it's giving me a pep in my step!
I just love this song it's my favourite song
I waited so long for this song and She did not disappoint us and for the ppl who hate this y’all dum for hating
"Thats not cheating if I wasn't with your ass" Pfff, how many of us can relate to this?
This sounds good. Chillin' with this one
She ate this up 💋 change my mind
people saying this is dry; yall aint know FLAVOR when you taste it, full stop
This song is such a banger
2:19 why does she sound like Toad from Mario😭I can’t unhear it now🤣One of my favorite songs no disrespect.

Doja keeping sexism alive.  Holding down misandrism in 2022.
She really copied Poison Ivory
Favorite song ever now
amo la canción y el principio de la canción realmente me hace acordar mucho a real men de Mitski
Why did Doja Cat make a song about men who are useless? Is she trying to convince women to be sexist towards men?
i cant stop screaming the lyrics (obv the clean version cus yeah) this is a MASTERPIECE and NO ONE can stop me from aggressively dancing
this is hitting extra hard rn lmao🥲
I'm not gonna key yo car, I'll tell yo fuc*in mom, you should of paid my rent go get a fuggin

Don’t say omg it’s a sin(only for people that believe in god)
Don’t swear it’s a sin (only for people that believe in god)
Lyrics: Man this happened one, two, three times too much These dumb-ass niggas Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause You can say that again Niggas is square like Madison I can't even really get mad at them They fall, then I gotta facepalm Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassing Ten-page text, should've wrote a book, could've made a bag But he broke and he still waiting 'til I can chill And he really think I'ma get back to him Doing too much, relax a bit Acting like that 'cause your dad's a bitch Must be the way that the planets is Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick I'm a freak, not a masochist Should've known you had the baddest bitch Left on read and can't give head Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (your cousin) Logical thinking is just something that you lack, so What you even mad for? Looking like a stick up in your asshole I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fucking mom You should have paid my rent, go get a fucking job Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause  Edit: Please don't hate me for not organizing this.
I can practically hear the screams of other women listening to this when the song gets to  “THATS NOT CHEATING IF I WASNT WITH YO ASS YO”

Is so good
Why’s you’s quitting Doja? (ehh well she’ll never find this comment)
This song came out a while ago but i’m opinion i think it would have sounded better is she said “I shouldn’t pay your rent, go get a fu***** job”
1:05 but my dad left
so we are gonna allow doja cat to say the n word over and over shes white

#Dojacanceled
Que asco pensar que me gustabas tanto.  Primero fue lo de DrLuke y dije: son chismes. Después fue lo de su participación en los foros supremacistas y dije: es chisme. Pero lo de PARAGUAY no tiene presentación.  CANCELADA POR RACISTA, XENOFOBA, CLASISTA y por falta de Sororidad con la Kesha.
I wonder who wrote this
A
Pero Doja Cat no debería decir la Nword, si ella no es afroamericana
😟😃
Oh no I'm wayyyy too white... gotta say 'cuz they aint shit' 😂

Put the playback speed on 1.25x I promise it doesn’t disappoint
te amo, te amo Doja<33.
Are there any songs like payday by Doja Cat
what did doja put in this song- fr vibing too much 😩💅
yes
when i ask siri to play this it says “Now playing Ain’t BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP by Doja Cat”
I love doja kat and her voice is unearthly ❤❤👏👏
When this song camp up on my Spotify, I literally had to skip it because my parents were there, when we got there I put on my headphones and listened to it the whole way, I go on YouTube to loop this song because of how good it is, doja is my idle and I hope we can all enjoy her music!
Does anyone else other than me think that the chorus is kinda reminiscent of D12 - Lies & Rumors's?
QUEEN OF RAP ❤️
QUEEN OF POP 💗
This is lo-key, lo-down dirty Female-training-male sh*t. Thumbs way up, Queen.
It has become too relatable for women to be “taking care of” men who are lazy, while the women work their asses off & have children without fathers, while the men languish & reap the benefits off the backs of their women & often abusing them into silence & compliance. It’s so common, it’s in this song, and many other public eye media examples. That’s really fucking sad… wtf is wrong with men these days???
I really wish this wasn’t relatable but my kid’s dad is the absolute reason for this song (except he’s white) lol
THAT’S NOT CHEATING IF I WASN’T WITH YOUR ASS YO
esta canción es una de las mejores <3
huge hittt
Ai como eu te amo doja<3
Niggas ain’t shit
cada que te escucho me pongo troste y hot
esque tu me alegras la vida
te amo preciosa
Fell off hardddd 🗑

Man This happened one, two, three times too much These dumb-ass niggas  Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause  You can say that again Niggas is square like Madison I can't even really get mad at them They fall, then I gotta facepalm Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassing Ten-page text, should've wrote a book, could've made a bag But he broke and he still waiting 'til I can chill And he really think I'ma get back to him  Doing too much, relax a bit Acting like that 'cause your dad's a bitch Must be the way that the planets is Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick I'm a freak, not a masochist Should've known you had the baddest bitch Left on read and can't give head Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative  Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause  Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (your cousin) Logical thinking is just something that you lack, so What you even mad for? Looking like a stick up in your asshole  I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fucking mom You should have paid my rent, go get a fucking job  Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause

“That’s not cheating if I wasn’t with your ass” it’s different now that I’m on the receiving end of that message lmaoooooo
Doja Cat deserved to blow up. There's something so fresh in her music. Something we haven't had in a long time, or maybe never before.
P A G A M E   L A   R E N T A
Alright no one is hearing: 'Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends'!
I feel this song (genderbent though) Like, i've been played by women so many times I don't trust women.   So I date men  💅
Very creative song(N.A.S.). Sevyn Streeter did it first tho(2013 B.A.N.)

el unico hombre que vale la pena es jungkook
That's what girls are!
So its just cool to disrespect Black Man.  I don’t support this.
Doja Cat featuring the vocal stylings of the iconic and legendary Toad
here are some savage quotes; 1. it was a strange monster, for beneath its exterior, it was frightened and sickened by its violence. It chastised itself for its savagery. And sometimes, it had no heart for violence and rebelled against it utterly. 2. there was no other thing she could think to call it - churned and moved as it propelled itself across the ground, the living bodies of animals briefly appearing before being submerged in a sea of bugs as others rose to the surface.  3. The key to happiness is knowing you have the power of choosing what to accept and let go of.
I would do anything to hear the ig version of this song for the first time again. It still hits but but the rawness of this hit different at the time.
Doja te amo mucho, gracias por existir
0:15 ahhh

"Niggas is square like Madison" - Best line from the whole album.
The one black man she dated, this song is about him. And she is 100 percent correct. If you have never dated a nigga, you have no idea what I'm talking about.

Cuanta verdad hay en la canción ✨ la amo ❤️❤️
This song hits different to the other songs on the album
Lost my words ❤️❤️❤️
After seeing that tiktok about how doja's type is white dudes yet she's saying the n-word in this song makes this feel different lmaoo
First of all, humans have a strong need for safety and security and look for those attributes in their environment. We also look for physical comfort, such as an environment with the right temperature. In addition, we seek an environment that is psychologically comfortable: for example, environments that are familiar, but offer the right amount of stimulus.   Clean air and water, sanitation and green spaces, safe workplaces can enhance people's quality of life: reduced mortality and morbidity, healthier lifestyles, improved productivity of workers and their families, improve lives of women, children and elderly and are crucial to mental health.   Environmental hazards increase the risk of cancer, heart disease, asthma, and many other illnesses. These hazards can be physical, such as pollution, toxic chemicals, and food contaminants, or they can be social, such as dangerous work, poor housing conditions, urban sprawl, and poverty.  On the other hand, improving the physical environment can make healthcare settings less stressful, safer, and better places to work.    if we really want then why shouldn't we do it?  what would you choose this kind of environment or the lesser you cost?why not change uhu yeah   because less disease less health care cost!!!
The intro of the song sounds similar to Super Rich Kids, and I think that's beautiful!

We want companionship/a partner not a project
My song. 3 baby daddy  i never ask for them to pay my way
No this comfirm what are you beatiful
It’s like she knew what i was going through and made this song for me 😂
shit song man :( pls quit music
Inspired by a South African Nursey rhyme named Thula Sana
Dear Lyric Guy, where are you at?
!
LA MEJOR
someone pls give me some alternatives, what can I say instead of the N-word, I really wanna sing this out loud without being a racist
"ain't shit"
A very Elton John intro. Also I guess she can say nigga again?
She’s talking about a specific group of guys. Not all guys. There’s good guys out there, but to those who need to be called out, here’s your song.
she was talking about bm 😂
I feel like there should be a music video for this since its just such a badass song
Viciada nesse álbum 🇧🇷❤️❤️
I agree doj
😩I love it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💕💕💗
😈☠️🔪⚰️
Well I guess her daddy ain't sheeiit either. Oopsie.
we could say the same about girls it goes for both sex
This is a religious song, must be played at churchs. Amen GODja Cat
Wack wack wack
I heard this song a while ago but I came back to say something.  Ok, so while I was listening to this song, I was scrolling through the comments about someone talking about someone getting pissed off by someone named Nicholas. So then I started hearing ‘Nickels and Sh*t’. I questioned myself on why I was thinking that. Then the “can’t pay rent”part came. The cost of rent for some people is ridiculous and unless you have enough nickels, you can’t afford to pay rent. So now every time I hear this song this whole scenario plays on loop arguing back and forth on how this can possibly make sense.
2:04
Ok but it sounds much better in the live 😭🤚 But that does not mean that this beautiful
Cha uZandile uyashisa guys, shout out to a direct sa descendent ( those who know Yizoyizo know who).
Doja cat é a dona do meu cu sério
This is my favorite song from the album but am I the only one who thinks that kinda sounds like Bennie and the jets by Elton John?

Brazilian's love u
I can’t unhear the laugh now at 1:03 😭
1:01 anyone else hear the laugh!!
Hi
❤❤❤
Pretty angel”😂😀 ain’t shit
Why is she my spirit animal.!! Listened to this about twenty times lol putts me in my “attitude” lmao
Literally fast words spoken over three different noises . This is absolute trash
Doja has brown skin, so it is normal for her to say that word   My skin is white and I replace it with: stupid😩🤟
The visual I have when I hear this 🔥
That’s not cheating if I wasn’t with your ass yo, logical thinking is just something that you lack 😭😭❤️
MeeeEeeen, this HapPen onE, tWo, ThREE TIMES to MUCH!!!
THISSS
My biggest flex is Doja said my name on this song 😏
💘💘💘
me sweating while searching for the song by the lyrics
Nicki Minaj is the queen of rap  Doja cat is the princess of rap
💗💗 princess of rap
who's here wayv lucas incident?! LOL
A lot of people say she’s underatted. But what I think it is, is a lot of people are wary of her because of her anti-black comments not cause her music is bad
Catchy and clever
nigo zen shee lmao
DojaGod
That's weird but I can't stop laughing
Where are you all from?I'm from Florence 💕 i made at least 200 views lol
She is Nicki's daughter 😭💗
Doja but her right tiddy hair in the song👏🤪
1:01
yesss
Quem venho por causa dos story de belle
This song makes me want to kick myself out of her life
This slaps
nigga 👌👌👌🔥
As someone who is biracial like Doja I don’t think the writers should have forced her to say the N word. You can tell even how she says it it’s out of character. I don’t believe anyone who isn’t 100% black should be saying that word sorry
Bills bills bills's younger sister
I acc never get disappointed when it comes to Doja
All up in your fridge can’t pay rent  I felt that one hard
i remember I used to sleep on doja... NOW I sleep on a mattress 💅💋👀
Weeeey ¿Quien más ama el cambio de voz de doja?🤩🥰
My remix of Woman: https://youtu.be/DVywhzeZ6HU 💖

It's the meaningful lyrics for me
It's the "left on read and can't give head, really you ain't shit..need laxative" for me 😮
She never messes up
1:48
Ok but this song really hits when you sing it and feel it at the end especially when she screamed😩😩😂😂
I'm never going back to doja cats comment section ruined my mood 🤚🏼🙄
the tape looks like a bunch of ariana's videos mixed together
1:40
русские?
Am I the only one that thinks someone is knocking on their door when they hear this song with headphones??
2:19 if your looking for toads scream 😄

This is basically my favourite song 😬🤦🏾
Wait but like, if the message is that women are strong and independent, then why keep writing about men needing to pay her rent? It’s a genuine question I aint tryna be sexist in fact I’m a feminist
Here’s the lyrics:  Man This happened one, two, three times too much These dumb-ass niggas Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause You can say that again Niggas is square like Madison I can't even really get mad at them They fall, then I gotta facepalm Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassing Ten-page text, should've wrote a book, could've made a bag But he broke and he still waiting 'til I can chill And he really think I'ma get back to him Doing too much, relax a bit Acting like that 'cause your dad's a bitch Must be the way that the planets is Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick I'm a freak, not a masochist Should've known you had the baddest bitch Left on read and can't give head Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (your cousin) Logical thinking is just something that you lack, so What you even mad for? Looking like a stick up in your asshole I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fucking mom You should have paid my rent, go get a fucking job Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause  Welcome❤️.
Giving me erykah badu vibezz❤️
'You aint shit you the laxative ' my new fave insult 😭😭😭
1:48
my new wake up song
I have been waiting so long for this song!!!
I remember listening to the unreleased version everyday
Haha I can just see all the “hot girls” nodding their head lmao
Idk maybe it’s just me but this is a disappointment lol
Me being white and rapping this:💅 Me when n word comes up:😐💅
If Doja ever makes a music video for this I just hope that at 2:05 she bugs her eyes out and makes a creepy smile while singing this part 😩.

Here before The Who’s here in 2023 comments
1:48 yuhhhh
2:05 if you from tiktok
This might be my new favorite song
I love this song but I cant sing itttt
The timing of this release was impeccable. Needed this song in my life.
she finally released it😩😩
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this song slaps
garbage song
No scrub: who are you? Ain’t shit: I’m you but gen z
Sad how people are hating it after they pressured to release it, it's an amazing song I literally love it, she never disappoints
Ahhhhhhhh toad:👁👄👁
Super Rich Kids
I have already listened to this like 300 times never gets old
2:03
2:03
2:03
perfect
oh my god
Straight man and Doja got me singing bout how niggas ain't shi..
Its so sad to know some men actually got offended by this song, guess their egos and small dicks couldn't handle it😐. I truly believe the men that got offended ARE THE MEN she was talking about in this song. By the way shout out to the men that didn't get offended because they are'nt the bums here😌. I just think its so sad their egos got shattered that they didn't even listen to the whole thing, they really missed out. This song is the SHIT
"Acting like that cause your dad is a bitch" LMFAO best line
Ain't shit but its Doja
Okay so It’s an amazing song, I love it a lot But Toad screaming at 2:18 is fucking SENDING ME SJAHSHXHCHH
omg....
BOTTOM ANTHEM!!!!!!!!!
this version is not like the instagram version lol
This is new favourite songs well done Doja cat I bet this song will be so famous!
Idc what anyone says this is the best song on the ablum the lyrics are so accurate it’s not even funny
I’ve never been in a relationship but I still sing this song like I’m in one
2:01
Why is this song such a vibe it should be illegal for a song to be such a vibe 😂
can someone do “ain’t shit x super rich kids” mashup???????
"You should've payed my rent" like bruh pay your own
'that wasnt cheating if i wasnt with your ass' is literally vibe.
you can’t not feel like a bad ass bitch when you listen to this 🧝🏾‍♀️
Wait I actually love it it
Facts don’t care about your feelings, literally 💀
quem acha a música favorita do álbum antes do Tik Tok?
this song is so well structured
To good 🤯🤯😌
Shes just a straight idol.
MEU DEUS
Listening to this song like I'm not happily in a relationship
iv been waiting for this song for 2 and a half years agooo LMAOOO
2:00 the best part starts
Bills Bills Bills 🤝🏾 ain't shit

These guys ain't shit. For anyone dealing with these types of people, I really hope you leave them. Re-evaluate your worth and find someone that treats you as the King/Queen you are.

Lookin' like a stick up in your asshole I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fuckin' mom You should have paid my rent, go get a fucking job Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause

Aren't the ones hating the ones who pressured her into actually making this a real song? Lmao, stay mad. This version is literally bomb, as well as the Instagram live one. ✨
GİRLLLL SONUN DA
This is a mix of Bills, Bills, Bills, and No Scrubs 👀
Im a lesbian but I still sing my heart out with this song 💀
They should remix this it needs a tweak but the lyrics are 👍 good its still a good song
Her voice changed
ik i aint the only one who be listening to this then gotta reassure my bby that he isnt this.
didn't yall want her to release this song and now it released some of yall hate this what some of yall are ungrateful please😭
She never disappoints bruh
Me and my sister been waiting for this official audio to come ouuuutt😩😩
I hated this at first but u know it's decent after u listen to it enough times. Do miss the ad libs a bit tho
I know she wrote this from heart
doja cat recently said on an instagram live that the version she leaked on her live in 2020 is the SAME exact final version that was released in planet her, so it’s literally the same exact track doja said something along the lines that she thinks what threw people off was that in the live, she was singing along to the track and basically layering vocals, and she said she’s sorry for throwing people off but she completely understands why some are a bit underwhelmed  but tbh i love the track and it’s literally the same exact version that was leaked so i’m happy regardless 😩
ME ENCANTA
I been waiting for this one to drop since it was leaked 😌
YEEEAAHHJHSDS
This song is amazing bro she’s literally a queen 😩❤️‍🔥
Waaaaa she killed it !💎
ILYY
YESSS FINALLYYY
Why is everyone talking about the cheating line, I don't understand if it's from the man or Doja's POV ? Can someone explain it to me please ?
love love love
YESS OMG
Best female rapper (sorry Nikki)
1:48
*"Listen to your friends* *When they say...* *Niggas aint shit"*   feels very Nostalgic to me
dk why yall expected it to be the same considering she was singing over the leak.. anyways. its a bop either way
When I heard the beginning all I thought was “too many bottle of this wine we can’t pronounce.” It fit so perfectly.   But back to the MASTERPIECE. I’m not even a Doja fan and this was so good.
Ik y’all heard toad screaming LMAO
WHO hurt her 😢
this is so good what
I listened to this song when u leaked it Oml I love it .. I like the live version tho
My 13 year old should not have to hear this dumb ass song🤣 you failed doja cause this song is so stupid. But your whole talent defeat whatever fool thought you should sing this dumb shit! ❤️
I honestly love the song, the only part I didn't like was the part I was most excited about which was the one she shared on live. I just didn't like the way it sounded here. Everything else was good.
Someone tried to set her up for failure, but she talented and so it is this triple threat can’t be stopped! 😂❤️👍🏻
I want to sing along SO BAD but I can’t. I can’t say the n-word. I’m as pale as fresh fallen snow. I love this song. But I can’t sing along. Can’t even bring myself to try. 😅
1:48 “That’s not cheating!”
El "amiga date cuenta" proyectado en una canción
ATE THIS UP MAN
I broke up with my boyfriend 3 days ago. He owes me 2 months of rent. He cheated on me while living in MY appartment, eating my food,  and asking me for money  because he doesn't wan't to get a job, And told EVERYONE  he  broke up with me 1 month ago, i read that on his texts, 3 years of relationship just went away like that.  damn men ain't shit. I listened to this song for the first time 2 days ago, and while the lobby verse was playing he appeared at my appartment asking for the rest of his stuff. lol it was such a catartic moment

Honestly I loved it BUT I will say the bridge sounded better in the ig live with her singing in a lower tone as it balanced out the sound. Without the backround vocals the bridge is giving Elmo, very much recorded in Sesame St.
I've been waiting.
this better than the ig live one ngl
I'm Russian and english is my 2d language. I know English pretty good to watch movies, talk, etc. Can somone EXPLAIN this song to me? 😅 I don't understand her accent nor the songs meaning, even after  I googled the lyrics. What's going on here?

bestie i learnt this last year
Finally ‼️🥰
I didn't memorize all the lyrics from the live for no reason
im a nigga and this goes hardddddd
Trash
all I can think about when she says “that’s not cheating if I wasn’t with your ass” is Ross and Rachel 😭😭
богиня.
When I hear the beat I think of Super Rich Kids by Frank
The chunky fahrenheit previously note because scallion baly mess up following a godly gram. wonderful, ahead condor
Doja's voice and 808 hit me deep biskshshssjsgusgs
Honestly someone had to say it lmao
this song is just pure vibes
This isn’t getting out of my head so I’m giving up! 🏳️🏳️🏳️
Dojaaaaaaa momaaaaa I loveeeee uuu ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE. TURN IT UPP
1:48 is my fav verse
okaaaay am i the only one bothered by the line "you should've paid my rent, go get a fcking job" cos in my opinion it should've been "i'm not gon' pay your rent, go get a fcking job" idkkkk
Isn't the visualizer supposed to go move with the beat?   Also..  Doja..  Whenever you're ready..  I'll be the 4th time for you :).
when u heard this b4 becuz doja leaked it herself so you already know the lyrics be like:
Frank Ocean - Super Rich Kids (earl sweatshirt )
FUCK YEAH IVE BEEN WAITING 😩
Finalyyyyyyyy
I love this so much but I’m still gonna be listening to the leaked version. They’re both enjoyable for different reasons.

Me waiting for that one verse 👁👄👁…
2:13 THIS PART ITS JUST AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
Look at what you did, listen to your friends, when they say "assholes" (my version) ain't shit! Ain't that the fuckin truth! We've all been through this, ya'll know what I'm talkin about! I love how she just says it straight out like that, perfect!
She dropped this the perfect time I was waiting on these for a minute
"thats not cheating if i wasnt with yo a** tho" hit hard
Hey as a white person, what could be an alternative way to sing along to this? I can't think of a perfect word that would replace the N word and I wanna hear your thoughts! I guess "bitches ain't shit" is the closest I could get to but that changes the meaning.
Newly  released  Me *knows entire song* listening for the 10 millionth time
OHMYGOD
Ain't Shit video musica :3 a
sis ain't disappoint. I'm loving it!!! this whole album is fire!!!
SUMMER BOPPPPPPP

I don't know English but is really very nice🇨🇱
Idk if this is placebo or not, but the IG live version seems to noticeably bop way better than this version. Maybe it's due to the background vocals, or the echo, but something seems flat about this version.
Can’t wait for the video to pop off!!!!

LISTEN TO UR FRIEENDS WHEN THEY SAY BLESSED MADONNA AINT SHITTTT. she has yet to pay child support for our daughter dua lipa if she doesnt do it anytime soon i might just bring her to the courtroom ! and yes doja ill call her shes the mom of dua lipa we are both her mothers but dua grew up to be a pop icon only beacuse of my support not MADONNAS she pressed buttons all day and forgot to feed her poor daughter.. thats why shes so skinny and was anemic for years and she couldnt dance for shit. it all went well though, we are far better off from blessed madonna but my daughter wished to do a collab album with her other mother and although i refused at first, in the end it turned out to be my favorite album of all time! hits like pretty please remix made me who i am today, and in the end im thankful for that night i spent w blessed madonna and she got me pregnant. thank u dua for enlightening me u shouldve come to dua's christening ceremony it was amazing.. anyway love u boo be who you areeee for ur priiiiiiiiiiide dont hide , blessed madonna remix xoxo

FINALLY FUCKING LEYYEHSVCEG BROOO
F**ck me gusta muuuucho 😻
I been waitinggggggg 😩
I’ve literally waited a whole year for this song and god I can’t stop replaying it
I don't know how long I've waited for this...ever since her ig live
me watching white people sing this >.>
🤭🤭🤭😍😍
My favorite song with Kiss me more ⛹️‍♂️
I’m glad this finally is released 😫
I’ve been waiting😌😌......she ate
The fact that this will never play on the radio makes me laugh😭
FINALLY, I’VE BEEN WAITING!!
this sounds so different after listening to this on ig for so long
Omg finally
honestly a lil disappointed i liked the other version she has shared on Instagram the first time!
yes
Finallyyyy😭😭😭😭🔥🔥
She never disappoints😫
Hahaha HEARD IT SIS.
I'm dying from laughter!!!! 👏🏼
I loved how she was harmonizing in the live. Wish that was incorporated into the track a bit more
Ms. Cat I’ve been WAITING
i remember when everyone was cancelling her for saying the n word.
Omg she finally made this song official ❤️ I really missed this song from her earlier days
this the song for the rest of the year 😌
I been had the unreleased
OMFG ITS OUTTT OOMFGFGFG3POUPOQHPI3HRWNJG
THE PRO DIVESTERS WAS WAITINGGG FOR THIIISSS!!!😆😆😆😆😆
No cause I thought everyone was be dramatic with this song since I only heard Snips of it in tik tok but know that I listen to it…. Let me tell u chileee 😩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This resonates with my life. I wasn’t with your ass!!! It ain’t cheating dude!!! Yo ain’t shit 😂😂😂 it hit hard!!!
I don’t like her use of the N word but the accuracy of this song lets me know that she is speaking from experience so I’ll allow it
Vi a tradução e tô chocado como retrata a realidade de alguns casais q eu conheço
SHE FINNALLY RELEASED IR AFTER A YEARRRR😩.
“Niggas ain’t shit” that’s why I’m gay✨🏳️‍🌈
Dude I’ve been waiting for this 😫 LOVE YOU DOJAAAA <33333
this song sounds like that one friend who trys to comfort the friend who got heartbroken by a man or smth
WE’VE BEEN WAITING DOR THIS ONE! TURN IT UPP
please DOJAA hit me in the face with a chicken mallet <3
EVERYONE SAYS SHE ATE ...SHE SERVED but she GULPED THIS WHOLE ALBUM <3 no time for sipping or chewing. Doja gulped this shit and that's just a fact. THANK U DOJAAAAA I LOVE UUUUUUUUUU AND PLANET HER IS FIREEE. BITCH i was on doja's live yesterday. WHY R U GUYS SHITTING ON IMAGINEEEEE> it's FR one of the songs I have been streaming the most on the album recently I LOVE IT. ( i can't say favorite BECAUSE ALL OF HER SONGS ARE MY FAVORITE ) I keep "imagining" Imagine by doja X Imagine by Ariana OMG.... Also guys DONT FORGET about the rest if the albumssssssss Doja says her feelings for Planet Her are like how she felt about Hot Pink but with more uMpH but FR I dont think u can compare any of her songs because ALL OF HER SONGS are uniqueeee and they ALL SLAP. Every song by doja has a factor in it that makes each song different which I LOVE. TY doja I rlly APPRERIATE how much thought and effort u put in and o me ITS SO NOTICEABLE and Imagine is under rated. If u love imagine like me please show ur love for it so Doja can see<3 Ily doja and I love all of u fans bc we all have something in common we all STAN this QUEEN
Fuck, I don't wanna know who pissed her off.

I'm in love with all the album, and this song is a masterpiece! DOJA YOU'RE A QUEEN!
Sing it, Doja! No need to apologize! It’s about ONE guy cheating and out-of-work guy, anyway, not a group of people! ❤️🔥❤️
SHE DROPPED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FINALLY
I disliked this, who even is she?
The internet is shook by this album already... The magic this woman can do with her music
That FIRST VERSE  is absolutely INSANE!!!!!!! DOJA BE RAPPING HER ASS OFF!!!   "Left on read and can't give head Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative" (FIRE BAR!!!!)
FUCKING FINALLY
It's giving erykah badu tyrone I love it
The knotty bagel booly rely because fragrance physically trade off a smelly pancake. vengeful, flimsy hen
FINAALLLYYYY AHAHAAHA🤩
Doja has never had a bad song every song just hits
ogs know this isn't a new song
https://youtu.be/YASfcY-MARc
Love this 😀❤😅
I love you Doja Cat and music
Thought she wasn't releasing this one anymore. I kept repeating that live just so I could listened.
The "you should have paid my rent, go get a fucking job" SOUNDS SO FAMILIAR???? I've heard that style before from another song but I can't rememberrrrr
Yesss i been wait for this song
Fax
Favorite song on the album!
DOJA LOVEYA
i dont care what people say this song good
She was in her fckn bag with this one.
NO CAP IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO COME OUT
thank you doja, thank you🤍.
Tbh this album is fire 🔥 🎧🎼
This song is good but it hurts to hear  because women group all black men with these type of black dudes  when they just chose the wrong guy
She must be talking about her dad that does not claim her even though she's famous lol he ain't shit
Great ass true ass message.
Album is a flop do better
Horrible girl bye
I remember when she leaked the song on ig live and everyone was BEGGING HER to release! Now it’s here’s and people live to death! 😂😍
2:18 the scream in the background is the best part 💀
Ayeee ok Doja 🕺🏿🕺🏿
Doja is a G ❤
We have 2 sets of eyes – our natural eyes we use to see the world and our spiritual eyes we use to see the ways of God. Our access to the kingdom is through our spiritual eyes of faith, prayer, learning God’s word and relationship with our Father.   To receive from the kingdom requires you to see through your spiritual eyes and not your natural eyes. Take time to exercise your spiritual eyes. Let God teach you the dance of closing your natural eyes to let your spiritual eyes dictate your walk, ways, and response. The things your spiritual eyes can perceive can lead to creative ideas, a vital solution, guidance, peace, healing, better understanding... and so much more in our realities.    Practice closing your eyes to doubt and your understanding. Open your spiritual eyes of faith and allow yourself to rest in the ways, and leading of God. With each time your ability to walk with God gets stronger and clearer.
Unreleased version might be better una
YALL THE ALBUM IS FINALLY OUT❤❤❤❤❤

me encanta el ritmo esta canción <3
I CAN ONLY SING 1% OF THE SONG✋😭
She went off! like bruh she expose him sm
Doja girl.... you got  musical range like a mf.  You stay in your own originality lane blending genre's like you sat down and got game from some of the greats like Prince but you in your own time and space doing it only like you do.  Rock on.  I would love to see you make something happen with Alison Wonderland or even Billie Eilish because you all got distinctive styles that just might blow the lid off one of the biggest collabs to date.
FINALLY  I BEEN WAITING THIS SONG FOR SO MUCH TIME
SHE FINALLY DROPPED IT
This song is so goofy 🤣 And that’s my favorite part of how she is off mic. She’s a goofball and I love it
YES
ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaXTBgtY3b4
I done waited for you! 😂🔥🔥🔥 1:47
so nice to hear in high quality 😌
Omg how long have we all been WAITINGGGGGG YAYYAYAYAYAYAYASSASASASASTYYY
doja world domination
I’m not disappointed. This is a masterpiece.
i love the live version more, this ones good too but i feel like it was mixed weird, like at 1:47 i hear a cut and the timings off. might just be me tho
she finally released it the best song ever
BRO I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER
to the people saying this doesn’t sound like the ig version, doja literally said so herself that it is ??? she said that her singing over the track in a different way was a mistake because it gave people the wrong idea as to how the song would sound. so it really makes no sense as to why you’re all saying it sounds hella different or whatever. point is the song is the same so enjoy it as is.
HOLY SHIT- THIS SONG IS FINALLY ON AN ALBUMMM 😭😭
hearing dojas songs is like listening to doja cat ft. doja cat
I remember when she played it on her live way ago before she released it.. and it was still amazing than❤️‍🔥
SHE FINALLY RELEASED IT YAYYYY!! I've been listening to the video from her Instagram live for way too long😭

Whoever didn’t pay her rent , you got dragged 💀
the unreleased version is a lil better than this, like yk how it echos?? n the bass is a lil bit more louder hhhhh😍
There Needs To Be A Mashup of This Song As Well As A Pink Guy Song Because This Song Totally Reminds Me of One of Pink Guy Songs

Lookin' like a stick up in your asshole I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga I'm not gon' key your car, I’ll call your fuckin' mom You should have paid my rent, go get a fuckin' job  [Chorus] Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause–   don’t say the n-word if your not black

To the panini pressed BM: if it doesn't apply, let it fly, or GET A JOB! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Doja I really love the song, however I wish there was more emotion in it like how you vocalized it on the live. The energy feels off here, but I still can’t stop listening I love it 🥰
I just think every song in this album is the best song😩
Tell me why the intro reminded me of "Super Rich Kids" and "Bennie and the Jets" 😭✋🏾🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
HELP I LEARNT THE LYRICS A YEAR  AGO BUT IDC IM SO HAPPY
ᅠ                                                               ᅠ                                      ᅠ                                                                                                ᅠ

White people can publish the N word now? Even on YouTube? If they’re talking about black men it’s ok. All that black pride , Black Lives Matter, wokeism is fake if they allow this.
Thank you for dropping this while I have to drive 8 hours alone. Doja really watching over me 😚

The live version was better
About time
The psychotic explanation unprecedentedly obey because maid unusually sip over a erratic grease. upset, inquisitive stone
Jesus loves you all so much! He died on the cross for the price of our sins and 3 days later, he rose from the dead. He died for our sins so that we may have eternal life in Heaven with him and not perish in Hell. If you believe that with all your heart and confess that you are a sinner and in need of a savior, you will be saved! Come to Jesus and believe on him today! He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life! The Only Way to God!
this is sounds like some destiny’s child/TLC late 90’s/early 2000’s type shit at times, at least in my mind.
Been waiting for years for this 😍😍
The Female KENDRICK LAMAR 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
this song ain't shit
This is gotta be one of my favorite songs in the album but I have to skip like 6372837478281 of the words 😭😭✋🏼 fire song tho
💃💃💃💃
👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥
No your not getting this. I'M OBSESSED!
This is my fav song in her album
this gives me super rich kids by frank ocean and i love it now they need to collab 😩
1:45
THIS IS SO GOOD
HELLO???
I feel like this song is Doja lecturing me because of my ex
I WAS ANTICIPATING THE RELEASE OF THIS SONG FOR A YEAR
I hope this has a girl version. Girls ain't shit xD
We all have been wait for literally agess
I’ve been waiting for this one
Y'all it sounds different because she was singing over it in the live BUT THIS SHI GOOD
waiting for this for an year and god damn it was so worth it
PURRR DOJA YOU DID NOT DISSAPOINT

Aint Shit by Doja Cat ft. Elmo
Finallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
… actually fire af, ngl
I hope you find this text one day. When you went to China for "work"  and left me without money with the baby. I did some questionable things to feed me and your son.
yayayayayayasyayayyayayayyayayyaayayyayayayaayay She finally launched thiss
NOT ME BEING A BOY AND LOVING THIS SONG. WE AIN'T SHIT, GET OVER IT
1:49 no problem😆😘
I'm bout to fight the title
She can sing, she can rap, she can dance, she has a funny personality, SHE IS GOOD AT EVERYTHING
Where’s the piano reverb? Why did they remove it? Honestly, the original "leaked" version is even better than this. This kinda sounds flat compared to the OG.
I feel really uncomfortable when a woman that only dates white men is saying "niggas ain't shit"
Spent entire last night listening to the new album
OMG ITS OUT
YOU HAD NO IDEA HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN WAITING
1:02
only true fans know disfrom her lives
0:46
BRO SHE KEPT TEASING ME ON THE BIT “that ain’t cheating if I wasent with your ass”

I've been listening to doja for 5 years now, i remember saying this girl is going to blow up one day. I kept putting people on saying shes one of the best female artist I know. I so proud of her journey this girl has all the talent and she deserves every damn award possible ❤️
Tbh I love this version but I also loved the one where she added her lil alibis I hope she does and official version to that
Go get a fucking joooooobbbb!
I thought she was not gonna release this so ngl
thought the audio was getting auto paused for some reason in the intro 😭
Gonna act like I am listening to this for the first time....

1:49 my fav part :)
The dislikes are dudes who ain’t shit
The classism coming from her is excruciatingly horrific.  Such a terrible song.

But Women can't live without men. Truth.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❌😂❌🧐😲🤓
I love how she never disapoints 🤍🤩
who else thought she would never release this song but i’m happy 
This is hilarious!!  And sadly true. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Holy shit tho
Not the fact I learned this whole song a year ago whenever she sang it on her live and i screen recorded
Why this is my favorite  song 🤣
I am so happy she released this I cannot get over this for some reason
MaDlamini never disappoints😩❤️
Yesss I love it !,!
I LOVEBTHIS SHIT
Malady
The joyous experience ganguly allow because intestine firstly squeal until a tightfisted disgust. poor, mammoth meeting
Her saying nigga gives me a similar vibe to logic saying it
She finally dropped it 🥺🥺🥺❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥
Every song on the album is my fav
Omg I thought this song would become one of those unreleased song on some random channel 😭😭😭
Essa música me deu uma nostalgia, o toque no começo é muito bom
Nostálgic
I love this song
no cause you guys have been BEGGINGGG for this song to be released by doja and now you wanna bring her down Bc of the song you clearly begged for and aren’t satisfied with? Why won’t you try to make a whole song and release it to millions of people, sense you clearly have so much to say.
This is good
Yay finally
This is my fave sing on the album
This give TLC No scrubs vibes.
Who else still hears dojas live version when they listen to this lol
Who likes the Ig live version better
Ah yes the ol' "N#ggas aint shit" saying is still holding up in 2021 i see lol I remember in the 90s/ 00s when this was such a popular slang term.
I've been waiting for so long
Yayyyyyy
Yessssss finalllyyyy ❤️‍🔥
hearing this without the instagram live audio is weird 💃🏽
this is not the energy you gave in the live that day …
I love how she can carry a whole song without Ft. I hope she soars higher she deserve every bit of it.
i love u so much dojaaaa
This tight all the cadence
I’ve been waiting for this
Today I watched dojas live (6/26).. she compared this album to an everything bagel... And then she talked about this... She said that when she did the N ain't shit live some ppl said she ruined it by rapping over the track live. I disagree... She is talented!! Giving me gaga, Elton John, David Bowie and way outside space vibes!!!! She was created to scratch an itch I've had for too effing long
Remember when this was on TikTok
Fuck I love her 🫂
This is my song
FINNNALLY
I’m so glad she finally released this ❤️

OH MY DOJAAAAA
I thought she would never release it ! but I'm so happy she did !!!!
Please let me tell you about yourself, in about every female who sings Just Like You, the next time your mother should swallow, so that you would not be born with such fake bitterness, are you not following after your mother, EVE in the garden, a baby that was not Adam for over 18 years, but you reminded him at that time doing the argument, the baby's not yours anyway!!!! Now shut this site down and remove the content before I go and I mean really go off on you
SHE RELEASED THE SONG IM SO HAPPY!
Finally
Doja, this song feels like closure I never got. I dedicate this to my piece of shit ex who used me and then left me for my cousin and didn’t do a damn thing to contribute to anything while with me. I fucking love this song. ( I’m fucking dead cause he really didn’t even pay rent 💀 )
Feelin this💃

I want you all know that God loves you, Jesus loves you, and I love you all too! We’re living in the end of days and the Rapture is soon to be upon us!!! We gotta repent and be ready!!! Turn from the wicked and evil ways of the world that go against God!!  Want to be saved? You must first:   1) Understand that the lifestyle you had without Jesus was wrong and repent of your sins with a broken and contrite heart  2) Believe that Jesus died on the cross for you sins  3) Believe that God rose him from the dead and that he is coming to the world again!!  God bless you all! God loves you, Jesus loves you and I love you too!!    Any questions, Talk to the lord first then feel free to dm me. Have a blessed day.

I BEEN WAITING FIR THISNONEE TURN IT UPOO

Bro I have been waitingggggg
This album is indirectly the greatest birthday gift I will have ever received  These songs are all timeless. Doja will never be dethroned off the peak of one of music’s greatest  I’m so thankful for her genius and everyone who bring her dreams into reality  The wordplay, the flow, the beats, the quality, the graphical fidelity. “Laxative.” It’s all perfect  I’m so happy for her and always happy to return to her music I think the only way I’ll accept death is if Doja can diss me on my deathbed. Otherwise, I’m haunting all ya’ll
Been WAITING for this song for SOOO LONG!
The beat is slightly different, the live one it had a more warped sound bass beat, this is cleaner and toned down. But it’s the same same song just slightly different…. LOVE IT THO
If I’m being honest I preferred the unreleased version

John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen

Listening to this while already knowing all the lyrics 😌
Wtf is that cover🥲 Like why
I’ve been WAITING FOR THIS ONEE
Best song on the album….
Her rapping is fire and the lines hit but I wish the chorus had a little more oomph to it
Mas atração de Doja  incrível eu adoro essa garota ❤️❤️❤️😘🥰
I waited a year for this ever since i heard it on her live
this song is a vibe 😫

This instrumental is GOLD
'N-word' ain't shit! I love it
AYEE
I was waiting for this forever🥲
Waited so long
She never disappoints 😩
Damn after a year I’m so happy to see this released 🙌🏾🔥!! I thought that if it was cleaned up too much I would hate it but it’s not bad (I personally prefer the raw one where she sings over it cause of the raw emotion and beat) but this one still hits
So proud that i discovered her before she became famous and i knew that she will shine in the future , she got potential 😌
best song omg
❤️
After almost 1 year FINALLYYY
no cause doja is always servinggggggg 😌😌
im sorry but like miss doja...? the overhype was not worth it idc, the only part that was good was the "that's not cheating" part and we all literally already heard that on tik tok

FINALLYYYYY

YALL DONT MF KNOWWWW HOW LONGGG IVE BEEN WAITING
Yuhh😩
For all Doja's non-black fans out there (including me) who wanna sing along - I suggest swapping out the n word for "cheater's" - "Cheater's ain't shit" etc. Flows just as well. "Players" also works if you wanna be as close to the original song's meaning as possible, but it doesn't flow quite as well imo. Up to y'all! :D
[Intro] Man This happened one, two, three times too much These dumb-ass niggas  [Chorus] Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause  [Verse 1] You can say that again Niggas is square like Madison I can't even really get mad at them They fall, then I gotta facepalm Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassin' Ten-page text, shoulda wrote a book, coulda made a bag But he broke and he still waitin' 'til I can chill And he really think I'ma get back to him Doin' too much, relax a bit Actin' like that 'cause your dad's a bitch Must be the way that the planets is Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick I'm a freak, not a masochist Shoulda known you had the baddest bitch Left on read and can't give head Buddy, you ain't shit, need a laxative  [Chorus] Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause  [Verse 2] Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (Your cousin) Logical thinkin' is just something that you lack, so What you even mad for? Lookin' like a stick up in your asshole I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga I towed your fuckin' pickup, your shit's in the lobby, nigga I'm not gon' key your car or call your fuckin' mom You should have paid my rent, go get a fuckin' job  [Chorus] Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib All up in your fridge, can't pay rent Look at what you did, listen to your friends When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Every song in this album is best
