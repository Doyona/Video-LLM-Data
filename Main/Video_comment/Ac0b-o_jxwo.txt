Thanks for 2 million subscribers 💙
You handled Fury better than Chizora did anyway Brian....😂😂
You against Fury....you were probably right there Brian....😂😂
Geordie you’re an idiot
He is more like the Gypsy pissi . Nothing more , he coldnt even understand what pepole are talking whit him . Hh
I don’t know who this is or what happened (algorithm spat this up while working) but the argument ‘I’ve interviewed Ricky Gervais therefore I can interview anyone’ is really not a good argument. Could he interview Yuval Harari using the same skills he used with Ricky Gervais?
Brian you're a top notch interviewer, you deserve your millions of subscribers and you were a real pro talking to Tyson who behaved poorly, almost like he was determined to have a aggressive fight with you.
There was no triggering done in the questions, go all the way back ta the beginning of the video call, his attitude even before speaking was clear to see, then he rudely interrupted to point out "I've only got 40 minutes for this" kinda like yeah I'm already bored so get on with it. Someone was lacking in class right from the off and it wasn't the lad wi the Geordie accent. Fact.
Loved it bud
Nice one Geordie
7:09
Tuck em
Usyk is older then fury
Well said, always watch your YouTube vids there great! keep up the great work your doing!👍🏻
"Put the phone down...if you know how" HA!!!
Your leaching of tyson fury now your full channel is all about tyson get a grip big fella you look like a real fool
Turned him in to ronnie pickering 😂😂 you really did 👏
Can’t stand this idiot
I used the Furious method for kindling and TP
Good stuff Brian. I cant believe I missed this one a year ago. Cheers Rob
Total Nob head  hope Tyson put the shits right up ya alley
Your podcast rocks. Keep up the good work.
Usyk isnt from his era😂🤣 yet AJ is 🤣 so why did AJ and Usyk compete in the 2012 Olympics🤣
Id put my money on u m8 😅❤😊
Found myself coming back to this to remind myself of all furys b.s
Why didn’t you say this in the interview? To Tyson
An extremely insecure man whose life completely revolves around what people say and think. You just take the opposite to be true of everything he says. The deadlines are simply his exit strategy so he can keep face. He only fought Francis because he thought he couldn't box and got completely exposed.
2.3 million subscribers Geordie! Well done mate,keep up the great work,I think you did an awesome job and yes we don't need to see em to know that you do have massive balls and the brains to match!!!
A bald man calling another bald man “baldie” just shows how dense Fury is.
Your interview with Fury was brilliant. Unfortunately I think he has a lot of narcissist traits due to adversity in his childhood, which is no excuse for him acting like an idiot
True geordie,everything u said about fury is true
Here after Ngannou embarrassed him
Beard isn't an insult and tysons legit bald. He is a joker though
Trust me. Hes not watching you dude.
U sound butt hurt like Tyson fury you just contradicted yourself lol
Brian and Tyson look alike
The fact that you're bein' straight out and not holdin' back only can give big props to you & although he's a fairly good heavyweight, however his actions are showing his true colour.
👏 keep it going
Admit down the phone, not face toface! Typical thick northern puff.
Tyson Fury is the king 👏👏👏👏👑
tyson treated you like a step child. Kiss his feet
You exposed greedy belly..cherry picking his fights.Smaller boxer like Cunningham decked him .He is using contracts deadlines to duck fights
Hilarious!
ill never take anything back from Tyson with regards how far he's come and what he's achieved personally and professionally. My only issue with him (and more so his dad) they contradict themselves all the time. One minute he doesn't care about money then he's arguing over % in fight purses. Or, I dont care about boxing, then saying he is the best of all time. Its not hard to stay consistent. Just speak the truth all the time and youll always be in line
You should apologize to Tyson, he is the heavyweight champion of the world and if he doesn't want to talk about something then don't talk about it.
Why did a scarecrow win a Nobel prize? Because he was outstanding in his field.
your not annoying.   great interviewer.
He's punch drunk ffs!...What did you REALLY expect?????.....MEN!🙄🇦🇺
Tyson is the most overated fighter maybe ever
He was smiling while swearing at you , it looked like good hearted  banter to me
You make very valid points Brian! They would be more respectfully be received if you didn't attach personal insults to them.
2:00 Did Geordie almost say the most dangerous heavyweight of all time? Surly not 🤣
The absolute neck of you to disrespect a man like tyson fury and also conor mcgregor.
Dude get off the roids big red face on ya. I bet you’d do a lap and keel over
What a muppet you are dude
That was a really cool interview, ego is an amazing thing. You said that and it showed so truthfully, I think the problem is that when you reach a certain level in fame and fortune, you unfortunately become disconnected from the truth which is essentially the people. Where you come from and where you are going depends on the truth you follow and who you surround yourself with. Tyson is a great man who has come from a very hard place and has had to overcome adversity, the people who surrounded him in his early days have just supported his animal instinct to beat the very best and challenge himself every time. Unfortunately with fame and fortune, it just comes down to the yes men and money.
What I can't understand is regardless of who the big weirdo is fighting, who on earth actually pays for it?😂 I mean I'd pay for a freak show like mcgregor/mayweather but a tyson fury fight? Are you mad😂
Furys a clown . He spits his dummy out if you can’t criticize him . He’s like a spoilt brat .
Im not a fan of youra TG but I agree with you on Tyson. You won thia one
It’s a shame fury doesn’t get told to his face often enough . He needs telling he’s a joke and bringing boxing down .
Fury is a foul mouthed bully . Calls everyone out then ducks them all . He’s a clown . Calls out Jon jones the n can’t back out quick enough . It’ll be chisora again he’s frightened to get in with usyk . No balls fury .
As a 46 year old man I've watched some of the very best heavyweight  fights in the world as a lot of people my age and people who love to know a lot about great fighters have ,  I think every word that comes out your mouth is 100% correct and I respect  you a lot because  when people turn around and put there selves in the same category as some of the greatest heavy weight champions I think that that  there is a comment of disrespect to those great champions , keep telling the truth because everybody knows you are spot on true geordie. The greatest fighters will also respect what you say too ✊️👏👏👏👏
TRUE GEORDIE  your not a sheep mate.great work mate
😬😬😬 cringe!
hard to be objective when you are attached to someones nutsack... good stuff Geordie!
you conducted that interview very respectfully.
The interview was perfect. But you have to complete this interview. You HAVE TO interview Usyk now.
I went off Tyson years ago when i realised he constantly contradicts himself, doesn't mean anything he says, no integrity, no humility, no principles or morals. Everything TG says about the fury chisora fight is what ive thought.
I loved that you challenged him and he is a walking contradiction. His team are the same. I was actually pleasantly surprised when you didn’t back down from those hard questions, and you really exposes the childish bully he is.
Great interview. People need to open their eyes to fury and stop slurping his nana. He’s  used social media to hype himself up without actually fighting anyone decent, ducking any worthy opponent.
Boxing is so corrupt and controlled, it's a sport that's rife with yes men and hangers on. Geordie is right anyone asks real questions gets ostracised and thrown into the wilderness. Boxings reputation is going down the sway with these new breeds of ass wipes running the show
This guy must have balls like a blue whale.
👍🏽
Great video and hit the nail on the head
To be fair I won't pay for the Chisora Tyson fight. It will be on YouTube the next day. I would have paid for Usik
So funny
👍👍
He's basically the boxing version of prince Harry
Fury is coward and a big bitch
Absolutely spot on........ BRILLIANT 💯
I thought you were too respectful to Fury. I think you should have cut fury off half sentence and that would have got him pissed.
well, i think you got your point across quite succinctly there. absolutely agree with everything you said
The intro is legendary 😂💯💯💯💯
The wort thing about it is he was fine right up until you was ending it.
Subscribed and liked bro, stay safe 🙏
well said seems to be takin fights he knows he can win
Goddamn, this aged well....... Chisora getting totally fucked up and slurring badly stinking to high heaven of CTE after the fight, then Tyson ducking Usyk now... SUBBED.
Of course you aren't interested in fighting Tyson Fury, you know full well he would mop the floor with you with his arms tied behind his back 😂
Tyson is building up chisora to raise his own ego for when he wins and then claims he beat a champion
You burned the biggest bridge in your life personal access to a boxing living legend. And when Tyson or his father see’s you expect a hell of a smack. Btw you were disrespectful and wrong the way you were blushing was proof you knew you f’d up.
Love tyson fury but you had every right to ask those questions and show that level of concern...having watched the fight it was a pay day for both, an exhibition basically...I think he was having a bad day and mental health stuff is a bitch so I respect tyson deeply for what hes trying to do in that area also
I back you 100% g
True Jordie- You have what it takes to interview anyone on the planet 100%.  No need to defend yourself.  Continue to be true to yourself. Respect.
Geordie is one of the most real and interesting interviewers in the media rn
Major respect for not backing down and not giving a fuck what people think
You nailed it 😜🤠🤠🤠 we true people know what you mean
Shut up.
Good interview . Why should you compromise your opinion . It was honesty not malicious
All us geordies piss people off we don't back down love u TG xxx merry Christmas and happy new year mate
you never went to school.
Tyson answered you many times, when he asked you who he should fight next you only named Joyce who you should of known had just had a fight! He wants to be active until Usyk is ready, prob march which makes sense.
Interviewers ego.
Brian’s a boxing expert also never had a fight in his life 🤔
Tyson fury is a compulsive liar
TG=🛎🔚
Top Lad, everything you said is spot on mate and you are correct in saying you asked the questions that we all wanted someone to ask but never did, and you did, so well done and they the media don't like it because they couldn't unless they wanted a career change and if you never interview Tyson ever again we'll you don't need to because yours is the best ever so we'll done fella
Brilliant interview...well done
Doesn’t matter who you are, what you do, whatever.. you don’t have to know anything about boxing to know about character. Period
Well said TG 👏 I think you were very respectful, composed and objective in your interview, I've been a fan of Tyson Fury before I knew of you but you've definitely gained a new follower after the way you carried yourself mate fair play 👌
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
If only Geordie knew lol
Mate totally 💯real top man no bullshit around I fucking love that 😂😂 we fucking think like and a 1000000 millions off us
😂😂😂😂 I love this guy sooo fuck real
Well said spot on
It's known that chisora n fury are very friendly, nice pay check for his buddy, nobody wants to see this fight, usyk n josh is the fight!
Well said m8
Due to his arrogance, Tyson Fury runs the risk of becoming a joke like Steven Seagul. For a boxer to diss a non boxer because he doesn't box is as stupid as a swimmer (or any other athlete) doing same. Yes Tyson Fury could probably beat anybody in a boxing match but he would be left wanting should he fight say a sniper at his chosen sport, again just as stupid.
Ali fought Ken Norton 3 times which is sometimes forgotten. Fury did not win the first Wilder fight by being down twice and the  champion not at all
" and that`s a fight you could sell " 🤣
Facts bro!👌well said! 👊
This guy knows nothing about boxing.
😂
Every time u step in to a boxing ring it's dangerous it two every whight at the end off the day anything can happen it takes that one punch 👊
You got slaughtered.
Keep it coming lad the people who got balls voice
Speaking facts bro but only thing I definitely don’t agree with is fury being the most dangerous 😂 and the dude will never fight AJ or usyk he will not fight anyone who stands a big chance at beating him that’s also why he picked Chisora instead of someone else because even JJ said he would be ready for December 3rd but Frank wanted to say JJ was on holiday,fury is overrated until he fight the other top 5 if he beats AJ usyk JJ ect then ok he’s truly the best but till then he definitely ain’t because it’s hard enough to get him in the ring,.he don’t seem to have trouble making a fight with a C level fighter but wen it’s a Top player it becomes very difficult with deadlines to make sure it don’t happen
Ego gone way outta control with this guy, tyson was throwing you a bone doingtge interview and you totally dissed him throughout the interview 🤡
HI, i'm a new subscriber and i really respect your opinion and passion since watching you!!  You've got me hooked now...  looking forward to seeing the Jordan Peterson interview as he is one of the most fascinating people in the world and really enjoy listing to his views on life... keep up the good work!!
Well said you are on it it would be a s*** boring fight
Oh you're getting a beating god help you pal
Fury doing the smart thing tho, Usyk and Joshua will give him more trouble than Wilder. But this interview was pure bliss
Words are more powerful than brawn and on that note Fury is a prat.
Totally unfunny and a True Waster
He imposed the deadline because he had the stadium booked  No other reason  A fight was going to happen on that day even if it was against my Nana
Who"s Ronny Pickering .🤣
Haha. A day later the dudes a joke crying on the Internet.
I LOVE TYSON FURY THE CHAMP HE WAS A BIT OUT OF  ORDER BUT IT WILL GET VIEWERS 😉
Karma u can make all the fun u want but u will be in the same venue 1 day and will be held accountable for trying to mug the heavyweight champ or maybe u bump into chisora and he shows u what time it is
Agree with everything Brian says here. Only thing I'd add is that money talks, so the only way Tyson and his entourage will get the message, regarding a possible mismatch, is if sales for his fight bomb. If it sells well, Tyson will carry on his merry way.
Big up Brian lad big respect for asking the questions we all want to be asked 💙
Reactors influencers, or maybe you should fight Tyson I pay for that
Who is the dick head now! Ohhh how tables have turned 🤣
When a YouTuber thinks he has some respectable input on what the heavyweight world champion should do. Fury fought Klitschko and wilder, Joshua fought bums and got dethroned by Andy and then usyk, both guys he was supposed to beat easily. Usyk is literally the only guy fury hasn't fought apart from Joshua who is a derailed hype train.
usyk is arguably the most dangerous heavy weight as of now and arguably the most intelligent
Haha you were not talking to him like that, where was this energy then 😂😂
Don’t ever joke about religion young boy
I only heard of you the other day, as a result of the fury interview - just watched it. Finally someone challenging fury's BS instead of sucking up. Great to see, and was highly credible.
Fury’s a conundrum for me,on one hand I love his balls to go and fight anyone anywhere on the other I just see a bullshitter.
Boxing interviews by some of those is an ass kissing exercise, they are afraid of upsetting or not getting the best interviews. You showed great integrity by asking Fury questions that needed to be asked and not skirted over. Total disrespect at the end by Fury, you had him and he turned nasty.
lets see if your massive balls can hold it together when you get to meet Tyson & Chisora in real life.
Just to be clear, I am the goat.
Brilliant and absolutely bang on, fury dropped his man of the people act and we got to see the real fury
Pride comes before a fall.  Stay humble or be humbled.
agree, solid, honest points, PPV for this is a no
Are you still having a great payday??🎉🎉 🎉
True Gordie……out spoke true gypo
*Laughs in Top G*
This Aged Well😂😂😂
Brian ask away but you were kicking a dead horse over and over, unprofessional as it gets
Welp 1.99 m now considering some of us unsubscribed to your idiotic comments and remarks. Good job False Geordie
Why don't you call out your mate KSI for the embarrassing bouts he has put out
Tyson gone to America smashed a knockout king 3 times,why can't he have a few easy fights, AJ been doing it his whole career, alright fatty
WOW THIS AGED LIKE MILK 🥛🥛
I'll admit, I've never fathomed True Geordie's popularity but I have to respect him 100% for being the ONLY person with any audience whatsoever to call out Fury on this bollocks. He's won a new follower!
Geordie can't mouth off to much because he will get slapped silly 🤣😅🤣  but fury's shine is getting very dim if I'm honest, he should be fighting Joyce as he put up a better fight than Chisora
Hey dork, where you at
In a nutshell, Fury made a tit of himself. Again.
BRIAN IS THAT YOU DANCING ON THE SUN BINGO ADVERT?
Fury is a liar and a cheat. A great boxer but a much bigger con man that’s managed to attain a huge fan base.
EVERY MAN SHALL TASTE DEATH.
Well done mate
I've seen through furys bullshit now he contradicts himself all through that interview
You have to remember tyson fury is a gypsy and gypsy's have always been known for selling your one thing but receiving another they make you think your getting top service but really the tarmac was nicked out of a tarmac lorry from a road build its exactly the same thing he sells his fan's his bullshit but really it's all about money and legacy
You just showed tyson for what he is
Now it’s 1.99M lol
Thought it was a great interview, let's face it the fury fight is absolutely pointless chisora is so bang average and everyone who's a fight fan knows its a pointless fight and Tysoe knows it as well.
I hope this channel gets canceled after True Geordie's Islamaphobic comments.
Absolute muppet
I'm glad you get a kick out of yourself. You're not a bit funny., nor do you look good.
Anyone with half a brain knows Fury faked his "mental health" issues to win over the soft British public. Worked to be fair
No respect man...bye!! Ego is an amazing thing init?
This rant was spot on
TG your the legend here not fury he's mainly all talk for a champ yes he's good but wow he let's himself down repeatedly calling people names when everything you said was true he's an absolute muppet I really hope chisora does beat him lol not going to happen though lol
Ronnie Pickering killed me mate absolute legend 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fury knows what you really are and doesn't respect you.
I know boxing fans are very sensitive, but ima say it straight up, Tyson fury is a great boxer pretty much in his prime, dereck chisora wasn’t even a GOOD boxer IN his prime
100% 👏👏 Let's go Geordie 💪
Absoloutely incredible intro. Watched the interview and now 30 seconds in to this. I've subscribed.
Absolute prick milking his terrible interview for as many views as he can get.  His apology was pathetic
Fair fucks to ya big fella. Great video.
To disrespect a great sportsman like this shows your level of immaturity. The interview is what it is, fair enough,  Tyson was wound up and flustered, should have left it at that.  Now to pick apart everything he said and go in on him publicly without him here to defend himself just shows you’re a coward and need to grow the fuck up.
Too pally? You mean like the Paul brothers? 😂
Good job 🇺🇸
I agree with you on this wholeheartedly. I'd much rather watch Fury Joshua or Fury Usik
I think the reason he was like that towards you was because in the back of his mind he kept picturing you begging for dildos up your arse and when you were begging to that cam girl and wanting her to cheat on you and all that cuckold stuff. Prob made him think you were a sickly little muppet. Interesting video
Massive Tyson fan  But geordie you conducted the interview brilliantly asked the question MOST fight fan was thinking why this fight, you didn’t back down while staying classy and respectful well done mate
Say what you want to about anyone ,but someone says something antisemitic and they get cancelled ,true geordie should be cancelled
Fragile narcissistic ego.
And he calls fury arrogant...me me me...hes now shouting and swearing at anyone who questions his interview
Has to be answerable to you. He answered you several times that wasn't enough for you
You’re probably the best interviewer I have seen for a long time. You are very respectful of who you are interviewing, yet at the same time you don’t let them get away with conning us boxing fans. You, my friend, are a true pro! That’s why I have subscribed to your channel. Thank you for exposing Tyson Fury and the truth behind why he is fighting Chisora. I pay to watch a lot of fights, but his one I will definitely not bother to pay to watch it. Fury has let him, and his reputation, down badly, and he may never recover. There is only one way he can recover and that is to fight Usyk, NOT AJ and definitely not Chisora. Thank you True Geordie!! 🥊
Desperate clout chasing influencer fck. Now you got your karma. 😂 You're not a journalist, you're a unemployed fatso trying to get famous sucking off his que*r mate KSI.
Tyson's avoiding usik AJ & Ruiz ? Gives deadlines that are rediculousely short. Tyson lost it 😂 because he had no answers 🤣
💙💙💙
F***er
Geordie fucked himself up with the latest comments : that interview where’s he crying is fucking hilarious acting
Big fan of fury but he didn't answer your questions as a fan. Your not a yes man!!.  Well in mate.
All credibility out the window after ur most recent video, maybe Tyson knew what u were before he done the interview 🥴
It was a better interview than someone like that brown noser Gareth A Davies gives!
If you go on Joe Rogan
This was just a bit of banter and back and forth.  Tyson didn't kick off.
Gareth Davies was a right tosser in his interview with ifl. Its like he watched a different interview to the rest of us
Dude you act bad over a video chat. You ain't doing that to their face. Stop acting like you are about that life
Bigger balls than all the Furys. Brian you da man
Truth
Ronnie Pickering comment got me 😂😂
But this is just a rant from TG, not properly considered, and therefore quite a few of the accusations aimed at Fury are untrue. It was a good interview and he was totally right to keep at Fury on his awful match with Chisora. But TG has a massively inflated opinion of himself, to the point of cringeful. And Russell Brand and Louis Theroux are NOT intellectuals, far from it!
Mate your such a fucking legend ❤ you achieve a lot brother keep it going
Huge respect to You TG! That  Interview was spot on
You have made yourself a huge target now for being so disgusting! You are up there with Tommy Robinson now
Fight someone or close your lips
Allah will never forget your actions.
As a journalist myself, I thought you handled it very well with some strong questions. Much better viewing than the suck-up interviews that the Danny Kinehan puppet, Kugan Cassius does and has the nerve to call it 'journalism'. Speaking of Kinehan.... I know it's probably unlikely you'll interview Fury again, but if you do, he's never really fully explained his own relationship with the Kinehan crime organisation. That is something that needs clarifying as it could be his downfall (as Sonny Liston himself found out when he got involved with mobsters).
An exiled Yorkie in Calgary-well said Geordie! I love Tyson but he did have to be called out on this one. Is there REALLY nobody better to fight and probably lose to him? There must be surely! Come on Tyson.
You was right to tell him no one gives a fuck about fury v Chisora he’s only doing it so his best bud gets a pay day
Ronnie Pickering 🤣🤣🤣
Racist baldi
that one random beard hair, disobeying orders
LOVE YOU GEORDIE
W
What a chad
True geordie ignoring and deleting all the questions about his screenshots being exposed where he’s asking girls to put dildos up his ass 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You need to address the islamophobic comments from your podcasts thats all over social media now.
You should apologize for what you said about muslims.
Where does he lives ?
If all you Muslims really care stop commenting here and go message his gymshark sponsor 😂
Can you please do a tuto on how to be certified peg boy?
Fuck you Geordie, You will get what you deserve for saying that
Be a man and a say those things to our face, oversized pussy!
This guy is an islamaphobe
how’s the dildos?
Bald racist
Racist peg boy
racist
This fool needs a good hiding
dont disrespect isham
True geordie is a disgusting islamophobic pig.
Let’s see if YouTube is gonna band this guy or they just ban the good guys
I would only say this y disrespected Muslims if you don’t apologize believe me you’ll regret it
Shut up racist.
Can people unsubscribe so he loses his 2 million 💀
U islamophobic tosser
You want to disrespect us Muslims? I will pray to Allah to punish you without mercy and will never stop till death. Unless you apologise then we forgive you.   And to the people thinking that it's a simple joke, it's not bro. He is making fun of the 9/11 situation, he is making fun of all the Muslims and sadly he is making fun of the deaths related to this stereotype. It's like saying "he should pick some cotton" to a black guy. You think the black guy will just sit there? No he would get up and teach the guy a lesson. So don't say we are overreacting because it's dumb not to. I have read se comments for us Muslims to relax but nah nah nah. We ain't chilling until we get an apology.
Honestly fucked up how you can get away with I guess a form of racism or a "sterotype" against a religion
U Will regret your comments. Like u are a Good person but Why be racist, so disgusted. U need to suffer mu guy
Disrespecting Muslims yeah? you will see...
یا لثارات الحسین 🏴
I WORK OFFSHORE ME 😤🤬
You islamophobic bigot!!! You should be cancelled for the things you said
karmas real 😂 he’ll get caught on the rebound
U racist
Mate your vile joke disrespecting millions of Muslims is a reason why you will never earn respect from me.
How dare you disrespect an entire religion and make stereotypes typical jokes that aren't even funny. Not sure how someone like you even has a platform like wtf.
Racist over blown teddy
Come I will report u
Feeding into a stereotype and making fun of billions of muslims, shame on you. You should apologise.
this is how you spell Geordi’s name: R.A.C.I.S.T
This guy is a totally idiot. Disrespecting a religion is not going to go in his favor.
You would not be interviewing Tyson fury like that without getting a slap baldie cause u got grey hair
You are a roided soyboy and don't understand what Tyson means when he's talking about history
Bullshit 🤢🤢🤢
Absolutely you will learn not to mess with the Islamic people you beef head bozo
Racist against muslims what a coward
I hope I see u in public event 🔪
You have angered over 2billions people,it’s on sight!
Do you enjoy blowing yourself up you racist bald pale biggot ???
disrespectful bastard , how dare you insult them.
There’s only one TG , and it’s not you
You will learn your lesson for disrespecting us with your boyfriend mf
Imagine if he made a Jewish joke, Imagine what would happen. Shame on the media and shame on Youtube.
ur in big trouble messing with us
The fact an Islamaphobe has a platform like yours genuinely scares me
You’re really down bad
APOLOGIES!!
So blowing ourselves up is a funny thing to you?
Top G will come for you
If you want to insult a person insult him not a religion with billions of People.
I hope whoever has any affiliation with you drops you
Racist fuck
Bigot

Disappointed. Making fun of a religion billions of people follow is not acceptable 😑 😒.
Ducking racist cunt, you need to be canceled ASAP
You shouldn't have disrespected Muslims around the world you racist bigot.
Pathetic person, consider everything about yourself.
Two Geordies just got busted up in HMP cause you’re big mouth. We’re on to you bad man.
You will learn your lesson brother
What a clown 🤡
Watched you for years and years, got caught slipping in a live stream, things dont just come on your tongue for no reason, youv always been islamaphobic thats why it was so easy for you to say it. Pig like behavior
InshaAllah 🪦
You will pay your lesson
We will never let it slide... Once we see you it's on sight!  Alhamdulillah
Out here making rascist jokes is crazy
Never had true geordie down as a racist. Lost a subscriber... disappointed
You should be canceled, you fat racist !
Gordie is a racist fucking gump loser chump
Clown
He's a dirty racist dog.  Textbook bully.  Acts all aplha but when someone bigger and stronger comes along, curls up in to a ball.  The Fury interview is the perfect example.  Depsite Fury insulting him, he continued to indirectly lick his backside out of fear.  Now he thinks he'll earn some brownie points from a bunch of racists by insulting Muslims.  Fat coward.
You fucked up you messed with the wrong religion asshole
I Was Shocked At This Guys Undercover Islamaphobia.
u going to get flocked for disrespecting muslims
Your going to see your punishment by Allah(SWT)
Unsubscribed. You need to publicly appologies. And don't ever make fun of Muslims ever again.

Make sure to dont disrispect Muslims  im from France dont play with ur Life like dat
You are complete racist scum. Never take the high ground against anyone, because you are one of the lowest scum of the earth. I'm extremely disappointed you are British. Just because you don't have God in your life doesn't mean you can insult billions of people you scum bag! Honestly the world would be a much better place than have people like you spewing hatred.
You’ll regret what you said
You will learn quickly my friend that is a mistake
Big mistake for disrespecting our religion. Wait and see
Comments are about to blow up...    Which is ironic

Watched you for over 5 years, and I've always known you to be a islamaphobe
Derik will slap u around with his left hand mate
Absolute joker, he loves is up the backside 🤣
I actually think people are allowed to joke about anything and a joke doesn't reflect what you actually think. But the thing I find really infuriating is that you called BradDoesBanter a racist for making a joke about your mate Viddal and then you do the exact same thing. Fucking moron
U can't fight a butter fly mate
I used to like you and like watching you, but you insulting our religion made me hate you. I unsubscribed and wont ever support you again because you’re a racist
Dont speak nonesense about muslims, its factually false that suicide bombing is permitted. You fool
does insulting muslims take away from the fact that u love begging for dildos?
You will be held accountable for the comments about Muslims

Racist
He does want he wants when he want and no one can say a thing, imagine having that control. He’s fighting Chisora to do him a favour and give him one hell of a payday so that he wont have to do another thing for the rest of his life.he’s playing the game and he can do what he wants. Again, imagine having everything and more.
You need to apologise of your racist comments.
Apologise
You will regret every single word u‘ve said in that podcast
Racist coward
Nothing but respect
To be fair Tyson looked pissed off from the get go...

I recently became you fan  after Tyson Fury interview. But the comments you made about Muslims are  not acceptable so I'm unsubscribing. Please do better next time
We need to cancel this guy.

But you’ve just let your self down, calling Muslims bombers. How racist.

I know Fury can be a cunt, but I thought that outburst was just a joke because he said 'good man' so I don't think he was actually serious
Fury embarrassed himself and showed himself up in my opinion. They were challenging questions and asked respectfully. Thank you for asking the questions the fans want to hear being asked!
Well said 👏🏻 I’m a big fan of Tyson because of the advocate he is or mental health BUT this is an easy fight for him and I have no interest in it! He needs to fight AJ, usyk and Joyce then call it a day.  Let himself down on this one I’m afraid
Hey bud, guess who's gonna Bn up..? Maybe in days or after a few years, you'll know when the time comes
Your a racist
I’ve unsubscribed from your channel. You made Islamophobic comments, mentioning how Muslims blow themselves up. You don’t go around insulting billions of people’s religion. Extremely disappointed.
fu for insulting our faith
Cant knock one thing you said and since my best mate (who's also a great geordie) put me onto you earlier today I've seen exactly what I expected , honesty and the balls to address things others would rather run from ....all in a true geordie style , I've a feeling most of your negative comments came from people who've never been to Newcastle and have zero experience of spending any time with geordies. In all my nearly 60years Newcastle is and always will be one of the best nights out amongst some of the most polite and friendly people in England , just dont go looking for trouble as it wont end well. But hats off to ya for responding in that real geordie style , telling it like it is 👊 and hitting people with truth......love it

True geordie I’m gonna blow up your sister vagina inshallah
Boxers are a weird breed of people right? 😆  Edit: he "Tyson" actually inspired me to exercise to control my depression. And it actually works! Sad he's milking the cash cow now though 😔
You’re a sick man, inshallah one day your eyes won’t be blinded.
So you disrespect moslims becareful that you not get blown up we have f…. You money so say that you are sorry
You’re an Islamophobic bigot! Hope you get cancelled with immediate effect. Also I hope Tyson fury catches your arse and fucks you up you racist prick.👋🏼
Allahu Akbar
The fact its caused so much controversy must be good for your views.
Bigot!
Islamophobic bellend
Well said lad 👍
Good for you Brian , good man 👍 give it em.
True Geordie Vs Tyson Fury... Would be a tremendous amount of interest.
RACIST
Address the islamophobia geordie
Guys report this channel, he supposed to entertain his audience not to spread hate by mocking muslims
Ffs    change the subject .your just a fat utber   get a real job
Joke of a fight not worth 25 p
@truegeordie didn't know you were racist? What the bigotry about?
Tyson Fury needs to understand he is coming across as if he is god, well gods head I believe was never as big as Tyson Fury's head. Many people who where Fury's fans will leave his fan base he has no respect for other boxers or his fans just full of rubbish, all he cares about is his self and money and his fans are starting to see through him. Tyson Fury your a let down too all.
You Islamophobia bastard
This guys a racist islamaphobe he needs to get cancelled for what he said!
You’re a disgusting human being for insulting a religion
Didn’t think you were gonna be racist Geordie
You know nothing about boxing. Tyson Fury would murder you in less then a minute. Stick to your content creator boxing matches.
I used to love Tyson fury now I just think his a giant cock with boxing gloves on 😂
My fury books ended up in the cold conservatory 🤣 he's went down in my estimation. Ignorant Pratt. Up the Toon!  And you're right, these so called journalists are far too paly with him, asking soft ball questions so they can get an interview with him to upload to - guess what - their YouTube channels lol and be invited to his after parties. Its pathetic.
Mate fury would give u a pasting ur just hard on the internet and ppl that watch u are under 12 years old, soft as candy floss u are
Mad Feind had his bike stole by that travelling boy. 🤣
Dude your acting like your in the mix and you know all the info behind the scenes.  The closest you've been to boxing with all due respect was commentating on a fight nobody wanted to see
Saying “Good man” for Irish people can be picked up in two different ways, thats probably where Tyson was coming from hahaha. Tyson meant it as “Yeah yeah yeah good man keep it up you tosser” basically
Your right he behaved like an absolute prick because he couldn’t answer your questions truthfully,he got pissed off and turned it to insults.👍
you suck off the pauls and your a islamaphobe
Well done TG. I thought you were respectful in the interview but asked the questions that needed to be asked.
Good man TG, great response... U should've asked him the question why he's not fighting in The States anymore??? This is the most obvious question that NO ONE has asked!!! For those who don't know, Google it 🤣🤣🤣
While i agree with some of your points Brian, i don't think you would have said the same things to him if the interview was in person like the last one you did. You hid behind the camera mate. Not very admirable.
100 precent agree with true geordie
100 precent agree with true gordie
You are a racist!
You did nothing wrong and didn't cross a line what so ever- keep up what you're doing which is bringing us the entertainment
Got to subscribe now. Well done Brian.
I'd fight the lanky streak of piss for one million if ya reading comments Mr fat fury
Lennox Lewis or klitscho never went on like that that's the difference in true champions furys immature and bi polar and bi sexual always on about dick and balls. His true colors were shown
Islamaphobe
Let's be clear. All these people are great athletes/actors/singers and of course idols. But let's be clear....not everyone are good people though and we shouldn't be surprised anymore that many of these icons are assholes.
Could tell from his face that Tyson knew he'd said the wrong thing when he said "Chisora has earned this payday", making it clear as we all know that it's a mismatch and that it's more about the money than it is the competition. It's a real shame and it's tainted my view of Tyson. It's a sham that Fury's having to defend the viability of his opponent. In any real fight he'd be trying to convince us that he's the better fighter, not trying to persuade us that his opponent even stands a chance of a win..! Great interview
Tyson Benn got things in common both got popped lol
Big up Ricky
Keep it up mate Smashied it
True geordie going to be bumped off by a pikey cartel !!!!!!
Well said! You couldn't have been more fair and grounded in your interview. Valid reasons and shown respect throughout 👍🏼
I don't know why everyone is so bothered we paid paper view prices to see Anthony Joshua beat Charles Martin people just love to hate fury any reason to give him a dig
slaaay my king ! 💙
Bro you talk the talk but am pretty sure you guna have to walk the walk at somepoint after these videos 😆
TF is allowing hIs Ego to run riot forgetting were he's come from, overcoming the challenges of his mental health... He's lost sight of that and I get understanble difficult for him in his position being the World champion ect. The fact he's losing his humility will ultimately effect his MH as in the past. in time I believe he'll look back and realise the errors of he's ways just like b4 he becoming WC, and we all know how that worked out for him.. (Suicide attempt!)..Get back to basics again TF and remember who's in Charge ..AMEN.
To me it seemed like u pressed him a little to much but it also seemed he was aggravated from the start which is fine but he seemed to play at the end didn’t seem he was serious
Racist 🤬
👊🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Racist
Where is the video I saw last night of you slating the younger Fury. What was that all about?   Your fans blowing smoke up your arse, telling you how great you are,  doesn't make you right and both the Fury's wrong.  You claim you don't want conflict, that it isn't personal, and then publicly flame a 25-year-old.  You have opened the floodgates for the "I used to like Tyson but.."  mob  (who never liked Tyson) and you appear  to be relishing in the conflict you have created. In my opinion, over time, more elite boxers will decline interviews with you, because you can't be trusted.  So enjoy your five minutes in the limelight.
This was a great move by Eddie Hearn. Bravo Eddie
How is no one talking about what he said about Muslims and blowing people up! Joking about it and saying he will do it
Heavyweight intellectuals roll call = shut the gate
Love this bro 🤙
Geordie you killed it brotha , understand your argument fully
So this idiot is now trying to make a point that he is somehow better than everybody else what a hypocrite. Trashing Boxers at their own game just to justify your point of view. When nobody else is available to fight at least Tyson and Chisora are giving something to the public unlike this idiot who always have an issue and of course hes a sellout to other promotions.
To say the usyk and chisora fight was 1 sided ure on drugs that was defo usyks hardest fight at heavyweight
I just saw a clip someone shared on twitter of Brian joking about suicide and it honestly knocked me sick, disgusting bastard, crying about logan paul joking about suicide and then joking about it himself, what a fucking hypocrite, and islamophobic too, honestly never expected this from true geordie, joking about suicide like that is so fucked up I tried to find the video so I could report it but looks like he's removed it already and I'm not surprised
Racist weirdo.
The fury’s are nerds. Tyson fights bums, Tommy fights bums AND ducks Jake Paul, and god knows the names of the other ones
Fury Chisora    is  dogsh-t👎
Tommy doesn't have a leg to stand on., Brian. He's the one who thought it would be a good idea to bring Big John to another presser 🤦🏼‍♀️ Jokes on him
The only 'clown' is the guy who thought it would be a good idea to take Big John to another presser 🤦🏼‍♀️
Racist
You did fine.  I don't understand what all the criticism is about.  Honestly, it was Tyson who showed his ass in that interview.  I lost some respect for that guy over how he carried himself.  But TG, you're alright in my book 👍
Fucking hell Geordie just did a Tyson Fury. I cringed pretty hard at that
Racist rat
Your very racist towards the Muslims what do you mean by blowing myself up huh?
Racist
Until he fights AJ and Usyk he cannot claim to be the best of his generation let alone GOAT
All the fury’s contradict themselves constantly ….  Making himself the dosser he calls everyone
Mark my words! Fury will make the fight look close and most likely go to a decision then go on to call out the people and say look you dossers Derek put up a great fight
How life can slap you in your massive bald head hey? Fury making you look like a tosser ,then openly being islamaphobic and hopefully getting stopped from everything that sponsors you , disgusting
Well TG did what most of the "veteran boxing journalist" could never do with ANY fighter which is hold them accountable. Sure, each and every fighter that steps into the ring is a warrior. TG doesn't dispute that, BUT, at the end of the day, fighter's salary comes out of OUR pockets and TG clearly stated alot of people were just not interested in this fight. Good on you TG, keep doing what you do. You did what many of these "boxing experts" didn't even have the courage think about.
It seemed like Fury had an issue with TG before they actually did that video call, not sure why though...
You speak on Andrew tates mum … how your mum 😂😂😂😂😂
Mic drop 🎉
IFL-TV suck balls, if they belong to Hearn, Joshua or Fury!
Those questions needed to be put and you had the balls and subscriber loyalty to say them: I tip my hat.
When is the next football hangover episode mate? I've been waiting 6 years...
Nailed it. Perfect response.
Funking spot on.  If i wasn't already subbed, I would be hitting the subbed button.  Subbed again.
I stood next to Tyson Fury in a pub bog in Morecambe. I couldn't help but look over and he's got a small cock. That's why he's so angry.
Who is this guy and why is he trying to cuss tyson fury? Wtf? You can tell he’s proper rattled by fury the way he’s speaking , weird
Ya  had fury wobbled just talking to him 👍
Most people wouldn't ask those questions but that's what keeps journalism real, top lad, big love, Big Mike Outdoors
The question to ask Tyson is how comes he ended negotiations with aj because chisora called him out about not sending a contract when Tyson said chisora turned down £3m live on talk sport. That’s what you should asked him
To be honest TJ, I've always felt you were a ego head but this past few weeks I've seen the real man come out and must pay you respect.
U asked him the questions that we all want to ask.! I thought it was a great interview. 👍
He’s bi Polar give him a break
Fucking bang on. Agree with everything. He's a fucking bully.
Surprised your not doing a crying video about it
Is this the guy that likes dildos up his ass ??? Disgusting individual Just listening 🎧 to you is annoying 😂😂 thank God I never subscribed
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Hahaha why you on your 3rd biography when you’ve only had 1 life!🤣🤣🤣
To be fair you’d think for a man In the spotlight as much as him he’d be better guarded to ‘unreasonable’ or ‘inappropriate’ questions. Childish. Mr True Geordie you conducted it amazing we love ya ❤️🐐
Demons = negative beliefs
Don’t milk it but I thought you handled great.  Nvm he addressed it get the bag lad
Hi bro mara ak channel ha mara channel Se ap ka help ho sekata ha
pull ya head in fury
He threw all his toys out of the pram when you gave him proper questions  for a change it's that simple  !
I really think people are giving the interview far to much credit. He said Usyk wasn't available for six months, other top 15 opponents didn't want to sign. He said in this business you have to take the opportunities you're given otherwise they pass by. Very fair points, I can see why Fury would be upset when he had already explained himself and he kept asking, and insulting, Chisora.
I really agree with a lot what Brian says in this video. Talking about having integrity and not being afraid to ask tough questions is refreshing to hear. But this video could’ve been made better. Feel Brian came across frustrated in this video. If this was a 5 minute response, with a little more structure (felt like it jumped about a bit) then that looks top drawer. Proper professional. Still only my view on it, and still great vid
Milk it
Fury should be looking for people like you to interview him, it’s honest and interesting.
Fair play mate 👍🙌
none of this drama makes me wana see that 3rd fight with Homer Chisora
I don't think you need to defend yourself to a small minority of critical comments of the Fury interview ; the vast majority were complimentary and rightly so. Keep your counsel and your dignity.
Massive tyson fury fan always will be!! Massive fan of you too. Very disappointed on the way he behaved  no excuses. He wasn't interested from the start. Love your podcast mate keep up the good work. Jamie Scarborough x
AJ  would lose just like Derrick. Doesn’t Matter which one he fights
Spot on 👍👍👍
6:44 Now THATS the point. I found Fury's behaviour at the end shocking and very very disappointing ; was formerly a big fan but no more. Hopefully Usyk beats him if and when they fight.
fury way on a come down in that interview
Odds on fury dropping to the canvas on purpose, and then winning just to prove a point that Chisora is a worthy opponent
Where I stand with the Chisora fight is I don’t care who he fights in December as long as he fights for undisputed March / April next year because if that fight was signed and locked in and he didn’t fight in Dec no1 would care. But to get out for a bit of activity is important
Fury has a real problem with contradiction. Even in one interview he contradicts himself and tg was only being honest with him. He's a very perplexing character
Best boxing  interviewer keep it up
Brain shows a flaw in all of celebrity here
I thought it was a good interview just because fury had to answer proper questions…good job
True baldie
Class
I'll put it this way. TG has more credibility in the interviewing scene than most of the people over at DAZN Boxing who are there to interview & ONLY interview.
FURY VS BRIAN FOR THE WBC HMMM I'D PAY FOR THAT
It was a brilliant interview 👍
you were well within your rights to question tyson , you showed balls, god bless
Yes True Geordie! Go off mate! I love how you called out these other pussy interviewers
Deontay Wilder was right all along.
I think you were pussy footing around in that interview, under the banner of respect....not being yourself is never a good look 😏
For a "money making follow up" I thought this video was needed and good to gear your follow up thoughts on that interview. Certainly changed my mind on a couple of things. Like when you said about true journalism. Can you not try n get another interview with him 😂😂
I’m starting to dislike Tyson!  his attitude needs to change back to being humble
Spot on goerdie in everything you said 😊
Wait till February fury fighting the local ice cream man
Tyson lost this fight top man only said a few words and tyson went into the corner if words can do that then you wud  kill him in the ring
I would love ❤️  to see you on Joe Rogan xx
Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
As a massive Tyson Fury fan I am extremely disappointed that he made the Derek Chisora fight. What an absolute waste of time and I will not be buying a ticket or even tuning into watch it. Such a shame.   I agree with so much you said @true geordie in this podcast and the Tyson interview. You put across what had to be said for boxing fans, good on you.   Tyson Fury wtf man? Chisora really???
Well handled in both videos this and that one. I hope Tyson makes a point to interview with you again, maybe right before or right after the Chisora fight.
Nailed it mate 👏
Will be fun when tyson  bumps it to him haha.
I have given you so much hate in the past but bro!!! You are 100% on this! I’m glad you stuck it on him and people are seeing him for what he is.
At the moment, you've become more of a man of the people than Tyson was
Interview was great . You were 100% honest which is what we want from you . Well done
Fun fact: Derrick Chisora lost to Robert Helenius, the man who was recently knocked tf out by deontay wilder
Would love to see geordie against Chisora
Well said true Goerdie making money off this count the £££ bro
Love the reference to Gareth A Fury. Biggest Fury bum sniffer in the boxing world. We need less journalist asking political questions, and more fans asking REAL fucking questions
Tyson is not a man of the people never has been and is getting found out now. He always been like this and when he came back to boxing he had very good story line which is nonsense and all been manufactured as no one cared about him or his boxing career when he was unified champion
Spot on Geordie Take note interviewer's Stop kissing arse and ask the true questions for the true fans. Fury actually admitting he's give Chisora a pay day??? At the cost of the fans You've been caught out yet again Fury. Have you paid them millions to the homeless you promised?
It's a shame as Fury has probably lost a load of fans , by not fighting AJ . TG says everything somebody should of told Fury yrs ago .
Sounds like facts to me
Fair play, Geordie. Glad you had the courage to challenge this bullshit
You turned into fury at 12 min lol
Its refreshing somebody finally stood up to these celebrity boxer hypercritics. you have got a new fan , very impressed by your work  and your a great journalist , respect sir
Umar & Gareth Davies just got their ass handed too here. They can’t and won’t interview Tyson like this as they would generally not get an interview from him again, I think Eddie Hearn was spot on about this fight. If we hadn’t seen them fight already we would be quite happy to see this one, but the walking contradiction that is fury, well it’s about time people started to wake up to his bullshit of lies. Congrats Brian you gained a lot of fans and respect on this.
It really wasn’t that deep😂 not for me anyways who really gives a fuck
I don't know about anyone else, but seeing the muscle this guy carries and seeing him annoyed, I reckon he would flatten Fury anyway. Agree with all True Geordies points raised, especially about the boxing journalists!!
For a 'mental health advocate', Tyson really does like to throw insults about like sweets at a kids party.
Would you have done the same interview if it was face to face???
Glad you asked the questions you did, but it would have been a very different interview if it was in person.
Fury energy lollipops cost a fortune. Over £6 quid in the supermarket for 3 in a box
Great interview and great reaction video mate! Proud to be a Geordie!
This is spot on. Boxing journalists are way too pally. You did a great job. Fury is a big cry baby.
It's simple ask real questions & people crumble. Respect for having the heart to ask the hard questions. Tyson was completely in the wrong and likely back on cocaine by all accounts.
These guys are spoilt brats, and they are accountable   Tyson fury needs to watch a true professional conduct himself in and outve the ring …buzz Lennox
I agree with every you said pal 👍 fury was wrong in the interview still like him tho I'll let him off. Not guna watch chisora fight tho hes a journey man 😂
Tyson was defensive before you even asked him a question. He looked pissed off from the start.
The first video of yours I saw was the Tyson infamous Tyson interview and now this! 🤣🤣🤣 brilliant 👏
You came across a bit of a prick to be honest
I don’t agree with you on everything but boxing wise your spot on 💯
Some people just like to talk,and talk and talk. And talk some more
The smug look on Geordies face would be wiped within a second if he bumped into fury 😂 Your first two questions were pathetic and designed to wind him up. I’ve followed TG for years and used to love his content but recently I think he’s turned into an arrogant tosser!!
If we had more journalists like you True Geordie, especially when interviewing politicians, this country would be a better place for it, keep you're call and don't listen to the haters, you can never please everyone.
I'd love to come on your podcast true Geordie and have debate with you over all this
Bravo TG, keep up the good work 👏🏽
The fact that everyone’s been thinking and saying this about Fury for a long time and then Brian has actually put it to Fury is brilliant!
You poked the bear bro, what do you expect, you literally called his fight boring. And said “he won’t put you down” bro it’s a fight that’s the dumbest statement I’ve ever heard.
Love it keep up the work TG 👊🏼
Haha, double up on content! 🤣🤣
Just speaking facts 👏🏽
TG is the one of the first to hit Tyson with the right questions, good journalists ask the right questions, Sky also had his number over the relationship to the Irish cartel.  In boxing terms, Chisora is a ‘keep busy fight’ for Tyson which he is milking to the extreme,   fair play to him for that.  The Usyk fight will probably come next year…….when Tyson can’t avoid it 😂
You handled it perfectly mate, I think he realised you caught him out hence calling you "good man" then had to end it because he couldn't admit he'd lost that argument.
Legend 👏
Fury is a clown
TG, you don't have to explain yourself to those that have criticised you, loosing your rag in the process. The majority of us appreciate you and what you bring to the table. Good on you mate, keep it up.
Respect for standing up for yourself and speaking ACTUAL facts even to the heavyweight champ of the world. Boxing needs to learn a little from UFC, obviously more money on the line etc but come on... the best need to fight the best
✊😎
He said after fighting Chisora he'd be the first heavyweight champion to complete two trilogies. Ali had trilogies with Joe Frazier and Ken Norton though?
Brain ask Tyson to do a charity fight with you we would all like to see it .
Overtime, I have gotten very, very, tired of hearing Fury talk. He has a tendency to treat people like idiots and also in a disrespectful manner, when he feels like it. You didn't let him get away with it. He was triggered. I applaud you Geordie.
I watched the interview, Tyson seemed a bit unhappy right from the start  before you got onto the subject of chisora , like something was bothering him , just a gut feel I got when it first started .
easy payday lol love it
You don't have to explain yourself, you calibre as an interviewer is self evident and the main reason you are popular, but since you did explain yourself, good points actually.  It also made me realize how differently an interviewer approaches and thinks about an interview when compared to a listener.
Keep doing you Big Dog. 👊
I think everyone’s just sick of fury’s bullshit now. I hope his PPV gets the lowest number of buys in history
👏👏👏👏👏   I would have much rather seen a exhibition fight with Francis than this waste of time fight with Derrick.   Well in
TG’s face when Fury says “you’ve never had a fight in your life” cracked me up.
PS: IF i were fury....i probably would have said "  yes, i probably didnt pick the hardest opponent, and in hindsight - probably should have done things differently ....but i've done it now  .... for what its worth i can see where you are all coming from - but ....its heavyweight boxing ,anything can happen ..& chisora is no mug .....lets see shall we? I would have swallowed that as humility and an honest answer...why is it (in ALL walks of life - the art of saying i was wrong - is NEVER shown ??? No disgrace in changing your mind and being honest )
Mr geordie ....you may as well go all in on your opinion ....he's never going to be friendly with you again ...UNLESS he eats humble pie (dont mean chisora win either ) i mean ....if he dispatchs chisora quickly ...then he looks foolish ....if he "carrys " him - we will know .....its a no win i'm afraid ...i personally think it was a tune up fight -quick money and probably a good tip of the hat to his rival/buddy - which is honorable ....but sadly , none of us are feeling it !!
He's right, being from newcastle does make us legitimate champions in winding people up. Just ask my lass.
You can't expect a genuis to be rational. When you first interviewed him on your show  you didin't. I thought the original interview that you refer to now was ace, you pushed him when he needed pushing and I celebrate you for it. With this you're just kicking him for clicks. In terms of your interview with Peterson, you didn't challenge him once. Even when he was saying if a man supports women's rights then he's purely predatory, you sat and said nothing. Apparently, men only say that cos they want to sleep with the woman. You never challenged him once big man, you let that fly. So ypu can't use that impotence as a form of strength in your argumanet here. A good show would be Fury and Peterson. The academic obsessed with testosterone, and the fighter who has it all. True geordie, who lives in London. Sure mate. Git up.
Chill your men
The thumbnail 😆, always been a fan of true Geordie I think he’s a pretty down to earth chill guy tbh.
Who cares
I would say I agree with Tyson, because the man just gave everybody 3 Deontay Wilder fights, and then Dillan Whyte which Whyte deserved. Why are we still questioning him? Chisora in my opinion gives very entertaining fights, whereas I don't think Joshua will even be as competitive after his two back to back losses. Let the man go back to the drawing board, he's not ready, and Usyk didn't want to fight. I totally 100% back Tyson Fury and I love watching Chisora in recent years even more, he's learned to use his jab and he's a lot more patient looking for shots. And I also agree saying "if you don't like it, don't watch it," because when he does fight Usyk, everybody will be back. Point blank period. I think that saying "I don't care about legacy" is basically saying "im tired of this stuff" which is really the mental cycle boxers, especially world champions go through. I think if you ask questions like that, then you are going to get your response, I think just take it how it is and we all just move on.
This was kinda embarrassing. You had the upper hand, Tyson was a dick but you're not helping yourself here. That cancer joke was weird. Also, you weren't criticised for bring up KSI and Conor Benn, you were criticised for bringing them up first, before asking Tyson anything about himself. He's in camp, open it up properly to set the tone. You're saying tyson can't accept criticism and look at the way you're going on here, it's hypocrisy at its finest. Again, tyson was wrong, you came out of it well but this has tarnished that. You've just spent a whole video complaining about a situation in which you came out with the upper hand. You said you wanted to make more money off it but was this video really the best way to do that? Tyson hangs around yes men but you need to get better advice too, clearly.
keep it 💯
If you can’t handle a simple question on the minds of the many you shouldn’t agree to do an interview. My opinion of Tyson has certainly changed, for a man championing mental health and awareness of where these issues can take you, he certainly didn’t hold back when abusing TG. Good on you, he looks a bigger SH! House than you for his petulant responses. Big dosser.
This is the truth being spoken right here.
True Geordie x
@Tyson fury you got to admit this an honest video.
True Geordie, the boxing YouTuber that couldn’t name a top 15 heavyweight ….
Your questions to Tyson were fine but starting the interview with questions about Conor Benn and KSI was very odd and borderline disrespectful. Ask that at the end if at all
To be fair. You can't disagree with anything TG says here.
Pot kettle black by the way 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The interview seemed to be going ok until you were questioning Chisora's ability. That's when it turned. I think he's just sick of people saying they don't want to see him fight Chisora again. Which is fair enough on both sides.
Tyson is the GOAT - Prove me wrong.
True Geordie Kinda made that all about himself there! Bitching and moaning sick of it now seems to he getting far too above his station rhyming off these so called intellectuals hes interviewed lolol says tyson chastised him then goes and chastises Tyson for 10 minutes! Turning into an absolute bellend now.
I think there is a degree of love for Tyson in British boxing but after his trilogy fight with Wilder I think people started to see his "true colours" I mean the way he dealt with Joshua was piss poor. He had the fight agreed before the 3rd Wilder fight so it was possible and he knew it but giving stupid deadlines showed he never wanted it.........same with Usyk. When he "retired" immediately after Joshua vs Usyk he called them both out........So I think Geordies comments  regarding ego are spot on. Tyson can't keep the limelight off himself and after his retirement the spotlight move to Joshua and Usyk..........but he took that spotlight giving stupid deadlines then went nope chisora a guy he's fought twice already. Also the whole ego thing is go watch True Geordie's interview with Tyson before and watch this one.....the ego change is massive. But to end the interview surely Tyson's a big enough boy to take tough questions he spat his dummy out massively here. When Geordie asked him was it a payout for the boys which tyson himself suggested it was ridiculous the way tyson reacted. Then the laughable thing you have Tyson's baby brother , baby bottlejob saying True Georgie is a clown? He's a youtuber and hasn't had a fight in his life? Did this guy forget he was on Love Island like not long ago? Did little Tommy forget he's been pushing for a fight with a youtuber twice and pulled out twice? the guy is a joke. He needs to shut up until he fight someone notable. Also him saying "oh well 70k tickets have sold so someone must want to see it" literally copying his brother word for word in that interview. Tommy is the biggest joke in boxing next to Jake Paul.......
Wouldn't want you any other way. Fairplay to you standing your ground and asking the questions us paying fans want the answers to. Top man True Geordie
He's become an arrogant s**t talking crank
Nicely put. Youve just got a new fan
Loved your interview. Thought you were perfectly respectful and your questions were well thought out. Tyson clearly didn't want to be there from the start and was just being a dick to be a dick.  Appreciate you being the only person with the balls to ask the questions we all wanted answering.
👏 About time someone has stood up to Tyson Fury. The way Fury has hoodwinked the media, his naive followers and the general public into believing into this mental health story which has been a cover for the Nandralone ban is quite frankly laughable.
good interview pal , poor reflection on tyson , likes being intervieved with fluffy questions , well done sir
Makeing a vid to get more cash off the back of some1 with mental health issues u are a joke put a sock init as a so called boxing fan Ur ego is as big fury,s trying to make a joke out of cancer
Would he have asked the same questions had he of been in front of tyson 🤔  no he wouldn't. He would of behaved like a squirmy fan boy that he is, earning off of his idol who he models his appearance
Well done true geordie true journalism is hard questions, the problem is it dosent happen anymore,  I wasn't a fan but you showed heart and big balls with fury, a true champion should be fighting champions, that's the problem with boxing,  The wbc belt has been in the hands of two fighters I.e  Wilder fury for 8 years and never tryed to box anyone for another belt to unify the division like aj was trying, there happy to get the belt and just pick and choose easy styles to keep the belt, they should be forced so there is no question who is the best, ufc do a great job of this.
His mannerisms when he becomes uncomfortable were odd, really don’t think he is mentally well.
Out some of the boxing perverts who weren't happy with your interview
YOU CAN'T JUDGE HIM AJ DIDN'T WANT IT YOUR A DISRESPECTFUL PRICK HES CHISOSA IS TOP 10  GOOD FOR VOLUNTARY ALL YOUR DOING IS GETTING VIEWS OF TYSON BK
Utter TRUTH…. It’s Sooo Refreshing… Thankyou T.G  …… MASSSSIVE  RESPECT 💛
Start with mental health His bipolar ffs
IF FURY WASN'T ABOUT WHAT WOULD YOU BE WATCHING?? ITS A VOLUNTARY DEFENSE
Your a man with sitting on ya ass with camera  HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT A WAR IS??  YOU DON'T SHIT UP
LMAO doubling up on content; easy money.
I love Tyson fury and I am team fury all day every day …. But even though I feel like that about him I really don’t care for this fight
Hahhahhaha you are butthurt ain't you? I would love to fight you Geordie. You talk to much.
FUCKING BANG ON! Off topic but if only there was more like you during lockdowns!
Fully respect you with that interview , about time someone asked him the right questions ..big up yourself 👏🏽
Now that was a fukin speech brian well said superbly put!!! You coverd every angle on that much respect🤝👏🤜🤛
He was right about the era though. When Fury was fighting Chisora Joyce was not even pro yet. So he is right about that. He also right on Usyk. He is only an heavyweight for 2 years and started his pro carreer 6 years after Fury started as a Cruiserweight.
You were right to ask him about it. You were wrong to continue that line of questioning for ten minutes. What did you expect?
Fuckin well said
Well F-ing Done.
We have been told joshua and tyson would be made to be free....  Tyson is also wanting us to pay for a ppv To see him school derek for the third time.  This should be free. Then charge us for joshua if anything
love it xD
He might be The Gypsy King, but True Geordie speaks for the people!!  True Geordie for Prime Minister 2024!! ♥️🖤🤍🖤🤍❤️
You bald tosser, line of the year that.
I love this, fuck all the tyson bumboys
Tyson fury is the village idiot
Ooooouuuuuuuhhhhhh that got very sourcey in parts hahahaha now now lads play fair 😂😂😂
He wants to keep himself busy, and because as you said his issues, he needs to be doing something, I have no problem with that. Maybe there were no other fights available, also Derek is a mate, so he's giving him a payday. I won't be watching it. It's at best a sparring match.
Great stuff from TG !   Now, all that needs to happen to put a stop to this nonsense is for no-one ( ie boxing fans ) to buy tickets to attend or watch on pay-per-view etc.  That would concentrate minds...
Well done mate! That’s how it should be done! Keep asking them fucking questions  like you should! Don’t listen to all the nonsense!!
I liked your interview with the Gyppo King. I’m one of many who won’t be watching it the fight with chisora
kugan  Cassius should take a leaf out of your book T G .
cool but Gallium is a chemical element with the symbol Ga and atomic number 31. Discovered by French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875,[6] Gallium is in group 13 of the periodic table and is similar to the other metals of the group (aluminium, indium, and thallium). Gallium exhibits relatively less similarity with boron due to latter being small in atomic size and lacking its reach to d-orbital.  Elemental gallium is a soft, silvery metal in standard temperature and pressure. In its liquid state, it becomes silvery white. If too much force is applied, the gallium may fracture conchoidally. Since its discovery in 1875, gallium has widely been used to make alloys with low melting points. It is also used in semiconductors, as a dopant in semiconductor substrates.  The melting point of gallium is used as a temperature reference point. Gallium alloys are used in thermometers as a non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to mercury, and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury. An even lower melting point of −19 °C (−2 °F), well below the freezing point of water, is claimed for the alloy galinstan (62–⁠95% gallium, 5–⁠22% indium, and 0–⁠16% tin by weight), but that may be the freezing point with the effect of supercooling.  Gallium does not occur as a free element in nature, but as gallium(III) compounds in trace amounts in zinc ores (such as sphalerite) and in bauxite. Elemental gallium is a liquid at temperatures greater than 29.76 °C (85.57 °F), and will melt in a person's hands at normal human body temperature of 37.0 °C (98.6 °F).  Gallium is predominantly used in electronics. Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, is used in microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Semiconducting gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes and diode lasers. Gallium is also used in the production of artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry. Gallium is considered a technology-critical element by the United States National Library of Medicine and Frontiers Media.[7][8]  Gallium has no known natural role in biology. Gallium(III) behaves in a similar manner to ferric salts in biological systems and has been used in some medical applications, including pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals.
😂😂😂😂
I'm a big Fury fan, but your interview was spot on, fair play for challenging him, that's proper journalism
Anddddd Tyson needs to get some prospective of his customers. We don’t want to watch trash fights this is a fact. Why he’s taking these types of fights is tarnishing his legacy. My opinion Tyson may be the best to ever do it. No one can compare in size and his skill level mannn.
I’ll tell yuh what, I’m just now getting into listening to pods and yours is in my top 5 all day long. Don’t let any of these ignorant people get to you big guy!
legend
Well said mate he's a bully what a tit embarrassed 4him who the fuck he think he is he's the best of a bad bunch  let me name a few who would  beat him foreman  Ali Tyson Lewis   I could go on he has done nothing beat 2 average fighters ken Norton  or Larry homes would beat him  he is just a big showoff who loves the limelight liked him up 2this interview not now absolute big headed  fud
Wasn't the second fight the one where Fury fought southpaw and by the end was waving the ref in to stop it? And now, 8 years later....
Love it, intelligent rant, go my friend.
We wanted to see Fury vs Usyk. Fury didn't want it. We wanted to see Fury vs Joshua. Fury made it impossible. We don't want Fury vs Chisora. Fury's losing credibility with thus fight.
I think tyson fury should really show more respect to his elders
Defo be more interesting Gordie v Tyson. Think you myt of catched him on a bad day. And he doesn't have a PR team. U got what he is
Trying to psycho analyse 'Fury' is like trying to balance a patio slab on a daffodil. He's the master of statagems. You'll never know what he's doing or where he's going.  When you learn to take him with a pinch of salt, then and only then, will you understand its all, "Mind-games & Bullshit!"  "ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!?"
Yes brother, well done, keep up the good work
Big up TG for this video and well done for sticking up for yourself regardless of who you are interviewing. Too many dick smokers these days who don’t have the balls to ask the real questions. Well done  for sticking to what you do and not changing your style because it was Fury. Ps didn’t think I’d see the Gypsy King rattled so easily, must be insecure about the REAL questions 😂😂
He's the best of the best he can make any dead line he wants. It's his turn now. He's been hated for years. Joshua is a bottle job
What a fantastic response, your in my top three boxing/fighting commentators to listen to. Very good.
The interview was started off in disrespect - you talk about fury’s ego although this video is you licking your own
With you 100% TG
Tyson has inspired me to start taking boxing lessons and overcome my demons and mental health issues.. That being said i aggree with everything you said. He should be fighting Usyk next cmmon!! No body wants to see this fight...Geordie please don't make fun of cancer though. Its not a laughing matter..  keep up the good work bro.
Surprised his dad aint cracked you out !!
Chisora would be mad at u 😂😜
Feel like Tyson was just messing about with you. I could see him smirking,
This is brilliant 👏 Boxing is a joke. It's ruined by politics, out of control ego's and too much money. We just want to see the best fighting the best. All the back and forth is only entertaining when they actually get on with job we pay them for. Whilst I would like to see baseline fighters in The UFC get paid more at least the best have to earn their massive pay days and give the fans what they want.
I respected him..... But not anymore🙁😐🙁. Great interview mate 👍
Fury was not up for that interview from the start. Even I could tell. Brian did nothing wrong from what saw.
Man is spot on, fury surrounded in yes men that just tell him exactly what he wants to hear
Confuses me. Isn’t Tyson Fury known to be bi-polar?
No way can Fury beat Usyk
Not that you care, but I'm not your biggest fan, but Fury was an absolute tit, and I'm a massive fan
I laugh at people who say " you don't know anything  about boxing " I didn't know that there was a boxing degree or diploma or a GCSE to make people qualified  in order to discuss boxing and make valid points. . Especially  taking into account that boxing doesn't have a real governing body to supervise it like football has with FIFA.. When someone says I don't know about boxing, I just say " I was watching Hearn VS Haglar on TV in Bagdad when you was still in your dad's bag, so STFU. 😂
Hahahahahaha I fuckin LOVE this man!! Big up the True Geordie!!
Remember when we all said we did not want Fury wilder 3??
I hope that snake Umar from IFL watched this vid
A fighting man, that to my knowledge has never even had a bare Knuckle. A bear knuckle maybe.
"You fuckin sackless soft pricks" is such gold haha
Bellend
Tyson, calling brian bald, would be like me calling someone big nose. Pot, kettle.
What a brilliant publicity stunt on both sides
I got to agree with u Tyson did not want to do the interview with u from the start and he did let himself down. U obviously wanted to ask proper questions that u thought would b a good way to to connect with him I think u were nervous and that came across but Tyson should have picked up on it and made u feel comfortable well done anyway
You did a great job.
agree with everything apart from Chisora bit. he is a warrior and recently had multiple even fights with whyte, parker, pulev and even usyk (looked better than aj tbh). i would happily watch 3rd fight, previous 2 were long time ago, and both chisora and fury are different fighters now. besides all that chisora is 9th on boxrec !
Love to see the balls of this man! Not literally... But yeah. This world needs more outspoken people like this man!
you're so wrong. He was not rude. He was clearly extremely drunk and cooked up. he was pissed off from the start and you watch his mouth the whole interview he was drink and cooked up. It was so clear. sad to see. hope he's ok.. He will be sad watching this back
Don’t listen to what people say true geordie did a very good job in that interview Tyson was the one who acted like an idiot and true geordie does his job very well
true geordie your a legend  you did the right thing asking tyson fury the hard questions that most of the boxing reporters dont ask, you exposed i think a little bit of tyson furys games and he did not like it. one love
You battling fury in an eating competition but fury took your opinion way too personally
True geordie speaks facts mad respect mate
True Geordie, take over ifltv
I agree with you  Brian on every account except that Chisora is worse than before when he fought Fury.  I personally see that he’s improved since. He trains properly unlike before.
Very ironic how True Geordie has his own melt down because he also can't take criticism. Starting an interview with a world heavyweight champion by asking about your mate KSI, a boxing nobody, is a very poor way to start an interview, whatever you want to say about Tyson Fury. Two things can be true at the same time, they're not mutually exclusive.  A lot of boxing fans could knock out KSI with one punch and don't care how many fan girls bought his PPV. I've got nothing against KSI, but he sucks at boxing. Stay off his dick before you accuse others.
imagine paying to watch that.
Couldnt be anymore bang on 👊🏼 good on ya
👍
Quality, True Geordie.
Your proper milking this. I don't think Fury lost his temper really. Annoyed yes.  Who gets the heavy weight champion on for interview and talks about KSI before anything else?
100%
Tommy said your a clown
Hat’s off to you mate 👍🏼
It's making you famous, I know that much.
Your 1000% right  mate
Love your work bro
True Geordie the type of guy to do a reaction video to his own interview. Talk about milking it.
Fury is a disrespectful twat. Keep goin Brian
Getting Tyson riled, is good business 💯
You did a good job mate. Tyson needs to understand 'The customers always right'.
I'm a Sunderland lad and can remember years ago when he said Newcastle made altidore look like Didier Drogba when we played them haha it was so funny. I like the lad and was so impressed when he pressed fury. Fury made himself look a right idiot. Keep up the good stuff.
As a boxing fan I thank you once more.   The likes of these alleged journalist like Gareth a Davies are arse lickers. Show them how it's done..
Whilst I agree with the general sentiment I disagree with one point; no one is making the "Great British public" pay for the fight. If you don't want to see it, don't watch it. Or pirate it.
When he tosses the books over his shoulders PMSL
Not a subscriber but I watched the interview and now the reaction and FairPlay to ya. Every body is thinking what you said. We where being set up AJ and got DC AGAIN. He goes on about giving people chances he should of gave one to JJ that one of been a hell of a fight. Well done you, I couldn’t take my eyes off the interview.
100% agree with you mate, tyson was off on one before you even uttered a single word.. Who knows why.. Only tyson knows why.. For me waiting until next year to fight usyk would have been the best in my opinion.. Mind lookin at you.. I think you would have a chance in the ring..
Only the fury fanboys will pay for this and go to this fight,I'm a fan of fury but this bullshit is unacceptable. I won't be watching and I beg my fellow fight fans not to pay or watch this.We are hardcore boxing fans not MUGS.Keep ul the good work brian keep on keeping on.
all the boxing media are revealling how much of  tyson fury dickriders they defending him with their life.
Thought he was a prick.
Tyson fury has gone right down in my estimation the past few months I hope derick chisora shocks the world and knocks him out
U better pray u don’t drop on Fury in a dark alley 😂😂😂 fair play tho the stuff u said needed saying an I’m a Fury fan
Unfortunately I think Tyson’s caught up in the whole Kinahan US government thing, he’s been lead into dark management places and associated with the wrong people. He’s kinda been made to make the only fight he can under the certain circumstances…………He knows Chisora is a totally awful choice but it’s the easiest one for the both of them to make decent money with out the draw backs of upsetting any “higher” authorities. Hence the brashness it’s the only way he can save face with out pulling up the real issues he’s facing!
Fury's a conman
Bald by choice🤣🤣🤣 with that hairline? Lol
Brilliant fighter  No social skills..
You could make an hour long video of Fury contradicting himself. He's gradually eroding the love by making some of the stupid comments he sometimes makes.
Huge
It's about time some one said something to him. Keep going I thought you did a great job.
Fury just wants people to lick his arse
Just subscribed to your channel. How refreshing to listen to someone ask the uncomfortable questions that the other channels wouldn’t ask. Keep up the good work 👍
Best thing people can do is not pay for the fight, but all the people slagging him off will pay for the fight because they have fickle minds.
Totally agree with u bro.needed calling out  and definitely needed saying. Respect
"Double the money" fucking had me, you absolute legend. Love you mate
I saw the video Geordie, and you are right when you sayb they aere too close to Fury, to ask the kind of questions you asked and the pathetic so called journalists, who are sniping at you, are all arse licking, Tysonites
You support newcastle right? you watch them every season play the same team twice , in 10 years you may of seen the same matches over 20 times but a boxer can't fight a man 3 times ? you're missing the whole point of what Tyson Fury was trying to say. He is fighting a heavy weight boxer in the heavy weight division it is a league like any other sport. I will watch this fight because im a boxing fan and one day in 10 years time all these greats wont be fighting at all. Get yourself a drink and enjoy the fight... it's not this deep
I thought the interview was class mate. Hes had it coming but his enterage and his arse lick followers dare not upset him
at the end of the day when Joshua couldnt get the super fights he atleast fought top tier world level. Fury is not doing that with chisora a man he has already beaten twice
Damn, Tyson showed his true colors... Kinda sad seeing it as a fan, Geordie wasn't in the wrong nor had any bad intentions, he asked questions that many boxing fans want answers for, but the big fat disgusting buffalo's pride couldn't handle it 😂
This review perfectly sums up Fury. He’s a genius in his field but at the same time when challenged he’s very contradictory, dismissive, and truly baffling at times. As far as he has come, nothing gives him the right to respond to people in such a condescending manner. If he really wanted the AJ fight he wouldn’t have abruptly shouted all the deadlines, he would’ve been in camp focusing on his training and leaving the negotiations to his legal team.
No chance am I paying for Fury v Chisora. Gonna take my £20 and get a takeaway instead
Show him some more respect you sausage.
I’m sorry but Fury is not the best fighter of his generation. Not a chance. If he didn’t have his height would he really be that good?   I still am waiting for Joyce to knock his block off
Bait and switch…..simple.
Great interview and to be fair tyson may of had a bad day and his reaction may of just reflected that. All the interviews these guys do surely they can't always be pc and bubbly etc. Plus he's probably frustrated that the aj fight didn't come through.  I'd say I agree about Derek being the gatekeeper warrior that shows up etc but he is fighting better now than when he and tyson fought.  Haye helped him develop and Don Charles has got him better now also. I think tyson would have fought Joyce or another top lad if he could have but this fight helps him tick over and give they're friendship a credit, they did agree the Swan song for Derek if tyson ever did have the opportunity to give it him.  All In all, people have a bad day and sometimes there are things that wind you up and you just got him at that moment.  He does need to earn as much as he can, and this fight as a businessman makes sense for him.   I can see it from both sides and I agree we would have liked to of seen this not as ppv based on the type of fight it is.   You were respectful and your job is to ask the difficult questions 100%.  I think let him have his bad day on an interview and let him fight chisora. We all know that from there the big fights have to happen. Usyk is a masterclass and fury probably does respect him and see him as live opponent but won't say.   Be good if tyson does give you another shot at some stage and maybe you can both laugh it off.
Milking it now TG...
Exec summary: Fury is a knob
He's done a good amount of damage to his reputation & career from that interview. Used to like him but now I think he's a 🔔 🔚
You nailed it Brian, was not a fan but have gained so much respect for you, what you did and how you did it. Full full credit.
The lump you found was on your head, ITS A DICK MATE
Why woud he respect you mate? He does the thing you TALK ABOUT!
Love how you just tell it how it is with now BS💯👊🏾 Tyson just danced around the questions deflecting blame as usual with his made up deadlines😂 Part of this though is the whole set up with Boxing it takes far far to long to arrange fights due to all the different managers and rights etc. Sort of pointless following most of them as they only fight every few years nowadays. Exactly why I prefer UFC as there’s a decent full card nearly every weekend not just one half way decent fighter and 6 other bums on the undercard💯
Legacy and History mean exactly the same thing? Intelligent guy
TBH I thought he was messing about. As for ego I'm guessing it's not something you can just turn on and turn off. Let's face it you got to be nuts  do a job where you keep getting punched  in the face. I enjoyed it though just don't go down any dark alley.😂
I think more of both Geordie and Tyson after this, can see both their points and I wish more interviews were like that one.
Tyson Fury jealous of you mate? at least you  said something funny
It'll be a short conversation when TF meets TG😬
Bro loved your interview man, you were respectful with ur questioning yet not dickriding him like others, you were honest as a fan and a journalist ❤️
I never saw this channel before the Tyson interview. I think you were never disrespectful and he acted like a massive bell end. I won't be paying to watch that fight. I can easily wait a day and watch it for free. I would have paid for Joshua or Usyk.
I Believe Tyson is struggling, and we need to realise that anger and frustration is  big part of that.
Chisora is like the true gatekeeper of the heavyweight top tier. I always think to be considered one of the best modern heavyweights you have to beat Chisora. Tyson Fury being at the very top though doesn't have any business fighting him again. If he'd angled it as a tune-up fight rather than making out it's a worthy replacement for Joshua, it would've gone down a lot better with people.
watch your back a gypsy might stick one in your back they look at him like god
Fury needed telling, no reason he couldn't of thought AJ after teasing it, hope no one buys the paper view
you are a muppet you set him up
Tyson will fight anyone like his old man John fury will 😂😂maybe next yr Micky Theo ah mush
Massive respect for pressuring him during the interview, for too long people have been skirting around the utter rubbish he spouts. Let's face it he is a cracking boxer but he is brain dead when it comes to everything else.
TG is the goat when it comes to boxing interviews.. IFL TV suck off every boxer they interview cause they're scared to not get another interview.
I thought your interview was on point and I appreciated your questioning because ultimately you were saying what a LOT of people are thinking.   That being said when you look who was available and ready to fight, Chisora seemed the only one available that had some sort of box office appeal. It’s still a mismatch but it is what it is. There was nobody of calibre to fight based on what I could see.   That’s just me looking between the lines logically.
Ok great..now bring on Derek ...easy money
Fury interview was Geordie’s “You’d be surprised” moment
Fury in the right
I'm a massive advocate of fury but he's really gone down in my opinion with the way he's gone about things recently, the journalists in boxing are a joke, Gareth Davies was asked about the situation then deflected and asked the interviewer what he thought about it? JUST BE STRAIGHT! Chisora is a joke of a fight
Thibk got you did it . His mh issues were drink and drugs !! Plain! He’s a bully to most
I can't wait for you to get rushed by some travellers 🤞🤞🤞🤞
You asked him good question and he acted like a b***h
Was he joking or not?
reacting a day after its done, news must be slow
Not bad for a dosser hey lad 🤣🤣🤣 Good on you for standing up to that horror
My cat is furry check the videos out
You are too funny :D You got Tyson rattled because he knew you were right on all points that you made.
I hope Fury finds his way again before he ends up like Conor McGregor..
Joshua and Fury are just not man of the people as they once was or claimed they were, Joshua with dodging fights/ losing fights and that stint after the usyk fight.  Now fury showing his true colours with contradictory espcially with the mental health stuff he's had in the past.  Lastly, both argue and bicker like little children, so harassing for heavyweight boxing.
Great interview mate..Really good speaking up for mqny people...BUT there was no need to bring up the cancer joke,just ruined it for me.
some of the front row seats are over £4000 who would pay such prices to watch this shitshow 😂😂
Tyson can't except that Tommy ain't as good as people make him out to be
Well said mate 😂😂😂😂😂
The thing is this,if you don't want to watch this fight then don't,no body is making you watch the fight,i won't watch it,but i don't bang on about it.
You don’t need to justify yourself, it was a great interview, many people saw the real Tyson Fury for the first time as for the rest…F**k em cos you can’t fix stupid or reason with ass kissers.
Very eloquent and brave, I never liked fury for the reasons you mention, obviously huge respect for him for his courage and for what he's done in boxing but his ego is way out of control,
NPD?
Love Tyson Fury, but agree, agree, agree. You speak the Truth...
usyk beat aj on points.. but ruiz battered him..he should be fighting him the shithouse
True Geordie stop saying it’s not going to be competitive!! You’ll without a doubt backtrack if Del Boy was sat in front of you, I guarantee your balls would go. Yes Tyson will most probably win but to say it won’t be competitive is bullshit, remember Joshua didn’t sign the deadline over commercial rights, don’t forget that.
Finally,finally,someone with a platform,whose is able to get to these people,holds them accountable.
Legendary status secured 👊🏽
I have genuine compassion for both sides...Geordie had every right to hold Tyson to account for the Chisora fight, but on the other hand, I think Tyson deserves an easy fight before he fights Usyk, which will be the fight of his life. The Wilder fights must have taken a lot out of him. Let him slap Chisora round for 12 rounds before he faces the toughest opponent he will ever face: Usyk
I like how he stuck to his guns but... its not as bad a fight as we are making out and if you go look at past champions they had plenty of bums on in there primes.
Keep doing what you are doing mate, absolutely outstanding work as always 👏
I actually respect that u called him out over a bum fight most people would be brown noseing him fare play to u lad
Never thought that you were anything but respectful whilst asking the right questions. You hit the nail on the head when you say ego. It’s all about ego. I love fury like many do but he’s a walking contradiction. It’s all about the money and legacy for him and unfortunately he’ll never be considered the goat if he can’t even fight every top fighter from his era.  As for journalists like Gareth and spencer Oliver saying you asked the wrong questions in the wrong order?!  These people are lapdogs
Don't usually comment on videos, but fair play for calling out what the majority of purist boxing fans are thinking.
Fury l would say is a little unstable currently . Maby give him a bit of time and re do the interview .He mentioned he could only give you a serton amount of time .  Because he wanted to train .
Why does this bitch boy have so many fans🤣🤣🤣
tosser
If its clearly not about money for him then he should be doing it for free right? and people should be able to watch it for free........? Just a thought..............Awsome video btw m8 with some valid points addressed. Oh and for the record m8, ive always enjoyed your content but this video has earned you much respect from myself. Hats off to you!!!!!
Fury was pissed off at the beginning of the interview. He’s also bipolar!
KUDOS True Geordie!!!!! This video was important, first to set the record straight, and among several other reasons to inform the mugs who might have had a go at you for being an honest and courageous journalist, - I don't see Jordon Peterson appearing on shows by boxing pundits! WELL DONE Geordie Boy ;) Alan Price would be proud of you ! Peace, Gus from Manchester.
Mate l think your brilliant 👏
Sadly in boxing you don't get the best Vs best often unlike  in the UFC. That's why the UFC is getting more  popular and boxing is on the decline.
There are times recently when I think Tyson’s mental health has deteriorated again. In all honesty he looked higher than a pilots piece box on Charlie or some other substance. Anyway, that was a disgusting rant by Tyson. I was always a big fan but I genuinely would like to see him get knocked the fuck out in the ring. He’s forgotten his roots in my opinion , it’s a sad transition to see.
He has bipolar true geordie he dies really struggle in the head to be honest
absolutely fookin funny, fair points and questions raised, you need get yourself interviewing boxers at press's etc,  mtk global pussyfoot around the questions on fans mind too much
It was mentioned the reason Tyson  fighting on the 3rd Dec is to help his friend to good payday but Tyson has to rem he can't take the public as if their idiots. Boxing fan are a diff caliber they want to see Tyson fight the best. But it seems these  English boxers seem to  distance themselves from the Americian Boxers. AJ has just mention 2 ole dogs he want to fight. If they want big bucks they can't keep fighting bums. But when the Wilder and Ruiz completed the fight fans will get the real fights they want to see. Usyk,Tyson,Joyce, AJ and Frank Sanchez. We want to see who's the best out of this bunch of exciting heavyweights
I've got so much respect for True Geordie after this video. He's so right, Geordie exposes the tiptoeing around that goes on when these people are being interviewed in the Boxing world. 👌
Nothing but pantomime from Fury, if he was really angry you'd know about it...
the answer is "greed"
This is absolutely spot on.
What people are forgetting here is that Fury still suffers with depression and erratic behaviour. Depression never leaves you, trust me I know. Just because he's opened up about it and does a lot for the cause doesn't mean he's on the straight and narrow. This fucks with you your whole life and every day is different... Up one minute, down the next. Most 'normal' people couldn't deal with the pressure he's got on his shoulders let alone dealing with intense depression. I agree that this fight is all wrong, however, Chisora is still as capable as most out there. Fury won't go all out on him either. If the public want to pay for this, then let them. And even with the odds on this loads of people will pay. Not everyone has got your morals Geordie.  Regarding your interview, your clever buddy. You know how to push buttons like a politician.
NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION…. Speaks volumes here!  I don’t blame you for defending you stance on this!…. Tyson came across as arrogant, ill educated and basically rude….. His reaction was odd and embarrassing to watch, so much so that its put me completely off him.  Yes, he’s a good boxer…… (that is it!)…. But he’s certainly not a good human being judging by the way he interacted with you..  He was dismissive and blatantly not rating you Geordie.  I left your interaction with him feeling quite sorry for Tyson as he actually believes he can converse on any intellectual level… I think not.  Large talented fighter…. Small minded self obsolved brain.
Boring bitching about celebrities. I hate stuff like this, your man card is removed!
That whole last rant was fucken excellent and Davies kisses the ring every chance he gets (so to speak haha)
I was glad when tyson said up yours boxing world, Im helping my pal out, I thought what a coo and way to fuck the controllers off, but that interview has put me off him completely, another hero of mine that has let me down, like virtually all of them have, in all genres, sport, mysic and   so called actors, oh well, life goes on nice one TG 👋
Jordan Peterson. Is one of my favourite people, that was a great interview. I think Fury is a fantastic boxer, they way you got the answers and reaction from Fury was outstanding. Too many yes men and intimidated interviewers would have buckled when he growled a little at them.  Tyson tried to make the interview awkward, straight from the start, you turned it around and made it entertaining. Genius.
I love how you brought up boxers like Muhammad Ali and compared Tyson to him. You’re right, Tyson hasn’t fought anyone worth mentioning on his sheet. Show me an in beaten boxer, and I’ll show you an unbeaten boxer who has fought a bunch of nobodies!
respek
Fury fan here, after this interview had me thinking what kind of man he is. The questions you asked were what I wanted to know, the threats like AJ and Usyk he makes silly offers with stupid deadlines as if he wants them to turn the offers down, calling out thor and ngannou what a joke just after the money and not after what the fans want.
I loved the videos but lets remember, you don't get paid because advertisers watch your videos. You both get paid based on general bods turning up to watch you, and you made a second vid  to cash in. fair play. That's the game.
Saw the first interview,  now this one,  just subscribed.  Furyis ducking both AJ and Usyk without a doubt.
why weeeeee fucking love you 😂
its a w for tg
The anger should be directed at AJ and Usyk for not fighting Tyson Fury this December and at Gordy for disrespecting Dereck Chissora.
Im still a fan look at my name.
Ok True G - you’ve made my year - well done 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
God help you if someone else slagged you off, get over it as it gets you clicks .
AJ didn't want this fight, 3 losses and didn't want tyson to finish his career.
Almost all of what you say here is true, but one thing you said was incorrect. "Nobody wants to see Fury and Chisora" Yes there are plenty. People realise Fury will only fight a few more times and they will flock to see him. Many may be T-shirt collectors (been there etc) but there will be loads going to watch him fight.
Geordie has never liked Black people and was putting down Chisora in front of Tyson and Tyson was upset at how Geordie rates a warrior like Chisora.  What Geordie did was full and if I was Tyson, I would have been upset too.
If Chisora has to pull out I will watch Geordie Vs Fury
When he said good man THEN the insult that should have been the clue that he was having a joke with you
Np.  Thank you Brian for asking a question on all of our lips. Kudos big man. Gutless fuckers elsewhere. You abd porkies corner are the only channels regarding boxing ill watch. I know there's more out there hatman for example.
can you not fit the camera up ya nose like.
Luke Fury aka Lieson Fury.
Love tyson but , we do not want to see him fight the same dude again lol for tyson its just an easy pay check
We live in a Donald Trump in wonderland world were facts have gone upside down now.
You’re a king man
He HASNT proven hes the best of his generation. He needs to fight AJ, Sanchez, Makhmudov, Anderson, Hrgovic, Joyce, Zhang, Hunter, Bakole, Ruiz, Usyk et al.
I thought the interview was perfect. You were respectful but the BIG BABY couldnt handle being challenged.
He was triggered. He doesnt like to be challenged. Lot of contradictions in Fury. Oh I dont hate homosexuals. Thats my god . Who I WORSHIP.  I dont are about LEGACY. I want to make history with a 2nd trilogy.
Absolutely on point well said mate
Here I was thinking this was going to be a light reaction video
Respect to you Brian fuck those people giving hate
Well we know Tyson furys next fight after the chissora fight it's going to be True Geordie 😂😂😂😂
Bro been taking that D apparently
Imagine if TG pushed Fury on his "alleged" charity donations smh
Geezer
I believe you when you said you have huge balls, respect TG the goat
Thankyou for using your platform to question the bloke hes no doubt a legend but his last two fights with chisora didn’t warrant a third there’s a reason he’s been unranked by certain boxing organisations
Just on the point of asking about KSI and it pissing Tyson off: not that I think it applies so much in this instance but there are some times in podcasts where Geordie goes down a line of questioning with a guest, simply asking about another person, it can sometimes feel as though the guest is thinking ‘why does he keep asking me about someone else’.. I understand you need clips and names in the title etc. but it doesn’t always feel appropriate to do that, that would be my only slight criticism, everything said about Tyson pretty much spot on though
Can I just ask why you turn all the comments off on your social media platforms?
Can't wait till furys brother sees you I bet you change the tune very rapidly
It's hilarious that I have seen comments of people saying that was a bad interview! Bad in the sense it exposed fury for being a twat? Bad for showing up the supposed boxing journalists all these years? Hell I have also seen comments on here about "Why are you asking fury and not Eddie hearn and AJ" well 1 is probably because hearn and AJ doesn't give him interviews and 2 is because we have actually repeatedly saw those two get asked hard questions but rarely see it with the likes of tyson and Frank.
Fair play to you brother you spoke the truth and that’s it👍
Honestly you were respectful but you asked honest questions everyone was thinking. Tyson is weird sometimes he is the most likable person in the world, and other days he is a prick like we all can be sometimes. you caught him on a bad day. Keep up the great interviews huge fan boss!
Let's go champ
I think fury’s back on the bag unfortunately but if he’s not and this version is the real him he will be hated long term
Mohammad Ali had two trilogies against Ken Norton and Joe Frazier. Oops I guess Tyson Fury missed that one out of the record books! He's going to have to make it three heavyweight trilogies if he wants create history. Dillian Whyte's hopes of a rematch start to look much brighter. But then Tyson Fury isn't interested in legacies and all that. Nothing but respect for the guy and everything he's achieved but he's making a complete fool of himself. Starting to sound like the "Dosser" of old before he retired the first time. He's no mental health advocate because he's no respect for other people's mental well being - he's simply monetising his own struggles and fair play to him for that. I'd rather hear True Geordie sing "Sweet Caroline" for men's mental health charity than this virtue signalling hustler.
true geordie vs tyson fury in interview is the same one-way traffic as chisora and fury in the ring.
Does anyone think AJ would give Tyson a fight.. it's not a fight that excites me.  I doubt AJ could beat a fighting fit Ruiz, he definitely would not bt Wilder and Joe Joyce would  batter him too.  Fury v any of them is a better sell than Fury v AJ.
Brilliant. A rant maybe but done intelligently and articulately and if I've gauged Tyson Fury correctly, he will agree.
Brilliant. and spot on. Journo's like Gareth A Davies trying to dumb this down or question True Geordies interview style... can't possibly admit he simply asked Tyson Fury the questions we all want answered and they are too afraid to ask. Get in True Geordie.
Tyson pulled out AJ fight just like He did the last time.
U seem angrier than fury to me. Who u think ur talking to geordie?!
Great vid but just to correct you on one thing tyson didn't come from nothing he grew up really rich and privileged
the rush i get from watching geordie on 2x speed is amazing and needs to be experienced by everyone
You are so right. Lol
Big respect brother! You spoke for the fans!
But seriously imagine someone having a bigger ego than Brian 😂never thought I’d see the day
I was waiting for you to bring in Stephen tries
Respect for how you handled the interview but you just went in on a boxing champion, gangsters look after these guys I wouldn't go anywhere alone after this, maybe not Tyson himself but his Dad would definitely pay a few guys
Beo give Derek his money we paying tk sort Del Boy out standard
Been watching Brian since the days on the sofa with a beer and a Newcastle rant.   Come a long way, but some things never change - main one being, this guy never minces words. He’s never been afraid of saying it how it is.   That’s why we love True Geordie.
Que all the true geordie fans jump on me.... but let's be right we all know this is a tick over fight till usyek next year but tyson never gonna say that because he's not gonna disrespect chisora by saying that. And fury entitled to that ppl are nieve its funny
Go Geordie lad
Tyson has that good ring craft that he can probably make it a competitive fight and let him get close. He knows he can get up from wilder. He'll let this fight be scrappy then take the tko imo
Tyson is such a boring kid
I watched the interview and I feel the whole thing is being blown out of proportion, sure the interviewer said what people really think and let’s be honest Fury isn’t thick and knows all of this already, but he did defend his very questionable choice of opponent as he’s trying to sell the fight. The big insult laden “blow up” right at the end seemed very tongue in cheek, I’ve seen Fury say similar things to other interviewers while laughing and he was laughing at the end of this interview, yes he was insulting and it’s got everybody overreacting and talking about it, so really it’s job done by Fury. I’m still not paying for Chisora 3 however.
Fair play Geordie , Bout time someone pulled fury on this total mis match waste of time , keep up the good work
Asked the questions that are on all of our minds.  Keep it real Bri.
The reason he's getting so 'triggered' is because your stressing someone with mental health issues...Herbert
Top class pal
Keep doin your ting big man
Mate, the fact you interviewed Jordan Peterson,  makes you a top g in interviewing.
There is a reason why him and Peter no longer speak to each other. Peter is no yes man.
Wheres the newcastle content at? True sellout?
brilliant video TG… you have my respect fair play mate
Brian, your an absolute boss. Always have been always will be 👑
THE FACT THAT TRUE GEORDIE THINKS FURY IS A TRUE GREAT AND A GENIUS IS QUESTIONABLE. THIS MAN DOESNT KNOW MUCH ABOUT BOXING IF HE BELIEVES THAT. COMPARED TO USYK HIS RESUME IS PISS POOR.
Your a pervert but your honesty is 💯💯
Proper jokes, I like it
There's always two sides to a fight and from what I can see Tyson Fury wanted to fight you can only fight what's in front of you and if they don't want to fight him and nobody else wants to fight him what shall we do just sit there we all know he's going to win this fight but there's nobody else that wants to step in the Ring with him it's called being the best heavyweight in the world simple as that and because of that fact people just don't want to fight take him let's have it right AJ should have took the bone he had been thrown because he's been beat 2 times in a row and 3 times in total so he should have grab that bone and eat it I'm sure I'll have different opinions to this comment and that's the great thing about freedom of speech we're all allowed an opinion and this is mine nothing more nothing less Tyson Fury the greatest heavyweight in the world right now simple as that and proven in fact
The guy that’s only interested in real fights but has appeared multiple times in WWE 🤔 an organisation that YOUTUBE star, Logan Paul has also appeared in…
Brilliant this man might go down in history for being the best heavyweight boxer in the world never been defeated but if he wants that title of being the best heavyweight in the 2000s he needs all the belts Wembley Stadium win all the belts then retire heavyweight champion of the world
Bipolar
Props Brian. I too love boxing and recognise that Luke is the man at HW in this era. You're dead right to question why he's fighting Delboy again after beating him twice with ease. There's no way I'm spending money on ppv to see that. After Luke's come back against Wilder, losing 10st in a year, winning the fight and being awarded the draw... Then the subsequent trilogy.. What a journey that was and what an uplift I got watching it. Now, I'm really disappointed in the man for his reaction to what seems an entirely reasonable line of questioning & for his treatment and attitude towards you. It's obvious to anyone that Del, for all his bravery and value for money as a fighter, isn't on Luke's level. We've seen that proven twice. Luke has made himself look like a right muppet here. You did nothing wrong and I applaud you for taking the stance you have on this bonny lad....
Every journalist in MSM needs to see this video and learn exactly how an interview should be handled. Top class from Brian here, Fury is absolutely taking the fans for mugs and needed to be told he isn't fooling any of us.
6:39
Fucking brilliant well said 👏
Think the next step is you interviewing chisora and make your name for the coldest boxing interviewer ever
Fury is bald as well 😳
Who else is calling fury out you simpletons.. pretty obvious aj and usyk are petrified.. you know nothing about boxing you clowns
No need to apologise for anything! You were very respectful towards Fury and Chisora. You asked the questions we boxing fans all wanted to ask. Much love and respect. 👏🏾👍🏾💯
He wants peggin really.
Fucking love you man say it how it is! I rate it
Mate, you and him at greys monument........'rumble in the toon'
I love your honesty. Please do not change what you do or how you are.
Mad respect for u Brian u we’re not in the wrong all your points were spot on. Keep up the good work man
Tyson is losing a lot of fans lately. He was an inspiration but now I have personally lost a lot of respect for him. You have just told the absolute truth. Well done you.
Tyson Fury is a boxer. In a street fight does not mean that he can fight in the street. So yeah why be frightened of saying the truth to him
I thank you for putting the questions to Fury that no one else has. You are so right. Well done. He doesn’t like it does he?
Props for being a dying breed of interviewer that follows up on answers and presses the point. It's got to suck when someone you idolize and respect goes off on you like that.
Respect ✊
Me personally I feel like the interview just got off on the wrong foot from both sides, there was a bit of tension. I do agree with u with chisora but Tyson is correct that chisora has thought all the greats and will fight anyone saying that I said myself that I believe they are good friends and he giving him a pay day.
Right on brother!! Appreciate you keeping it and them real! 💪🏻
Perfect now do Eddie hearn
Gareth A Davies referenced the Peterson interview basically saying Geordie didn't say much? Why would you with Peterson? He should watch a few more podcasts and see Brian at work.
You're an excellent interviewer, love your content but Joe Rogan is the GOAT, sorry. :)
I'm with Fury on this matter. Sorry Brian.
I’d love to see the follow up if Derek tags him and knocks him out 😂
Im a fan up to his last wilder fight he has now become a cocky arse believe in his own hype
wow - Fury doesn't get the 70% cut of a champion, always derisory offers as a traveller... TG - we shouldn't even pay him properly if he (rightly) doesn't accept that racism (and stops the 7 odd years of delay by setting deadlines)... just wow
Too many ase kissers to say what most think great respect my man I concur 💪🏻👍👌
youtube boxers youtube sites  = hit monkeys.
W geordie
Fury should have given Otto Wallin the rematch, instead of fighting Chisora again, for 3 reasons:   1) Wallin is ranked #8 by the WBC whereas Chisora is ranked #14 by the WBC.  2) Wallin deserves the rematch after the first fight. Let's be honest - the fight should have been stopped due to Fury's terrible cut meaning Wallin would have won. The only reason the fight wasn't stopped is because it would have derailed the cash cow Wilder rematch. 3) Wallin is a southpaw, which would have been the perfect preparation to face Usyk, who is also a southpaw.
TG congrats on the fury interview! you sound out of breath today, you alright bud?
Pure respect for you mate. That interview was as close of a reflection of what the public wanted to hear and the problem with mainstream media is that they want to famous figures as above everyone else so that they can stay close to them and keep earning. It's so easy to see that they keep the shackles on and I love Fury, but he's been looking a bit unhinged in the last year since the 'Retirement Fight' with all of the hostile videos (Respect obviously because I wouldn't want anyone to be stuck in a bad place). The way he spoke to you surprised me a bit and probably let me down if anything. We all love the badass persona but that seemed genuinely bitter.
Well fucking said 👏👏👏👏
The Goat
Well done mate, about time someone asked that prick some proper questions
Mad respect to TG for having to balls to ask the questions everyone else was to scared to ask.
Respect but stop acting like you said it to his face.
Your a fucking living legend brother
You were spot on to call Tyson out the issues you did . I like both fighters but I’ve no interest in Fury v Chisora 3
geordie rock it better den tyson
Spot on Brian, enjoyed every minute of the interview and this analysis. Finally someone who isn’t scared to put Tyson on the spot. Fair play mate, hats off to you.
Lemons are bitter, TG. Stop it. lol
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻absolutely. The real reason the mainstream "boxing media" are doing this is to protect there future interviews with tyson. Mainstream media in anyfield dont do as they should. And your right its not real journalism.
I am sure noone in the world went “yup, a great fight” when they heard about Chisora. Everyone was like “no way, really?”
Liked the first interview, not so much this. Tyson struggles at times as he has often said, this just felt like a guy being a bit of a bully to a guy who didn’t have his best ever interview that day. Big ego indeed…
Anyone feel like this story is blowing up so much, he might take a dive to try and prove TG wrong? 😂😂
😂, he wasn’t that bad, he was just taking the piss wasn’t he? 😂🇦🇺🍻
Well done True Geordie 👍
True gordie on the cross to Tyson fury.. caught tyson on a bad day..... drinks the  bitterness cup 🥤
Really must done your head in to repost a recap lol 😆
Absolutely brilliant interviewer. I take my hat off to you, not frightened of asking the questions the fans want to hear 10/10 for that, this fight is definitely just a pay day for his friend Chisora, bit like wilder's last fight against Helenius, its just retirement money, even though Fury wouldn't admit to it🤔
Fair play to true geordie he said exactly what the true boxing fans would ask given the opportunity. Great work!
Well said, Hear Hear
I agree I won't buy that fight
Love Tyson Fury but you %💯 right
Respect to you True Geordie
Tysons really losing steam for me, he’s losing me as a fan with the way he’s acting lately
🥛🥛🥛🥛
Who are the 50,000 people who have purchased tickets ?
Love Brian saying it as it is. Keep it up bro
Fair points made with Chisora. I worry that he will get hurt. Not a mega fight sadly.
Plot twist: Derrick knocks Fury out in the 4th
Whats your credentials do you have to forward opinion on these fights in front of the public eye???
u snaked him
Thought your interview was excellent! Thought you were very respectful and just asking questions all the fans wanted to know. Started following you and looking forward to more interview from you
0:33 "if you know how" lmao
This was Fucking GOLD 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
You just said what all boxing fans are thinking big respect
Tyson is promoting. Of course he is not gonna devalue the upcoming fight
Hahaha mate you started this video off absolutely perfectly
I love Tyson but massive respect to you for the interview! These things need to be said. These questions need to be asked. World class! Also didn't know you were on the Riggs, massive respect again! Thank you from myself and the fans!
🤣🤣 quality, big G 👌 👏
Fury done what he always does, talk nonsense. The man contradicts himself all the time. It was funny watching him trying to justify taking the easy fight.
Hahah that was boss ! Fury unable to deal with an honest Frank discussion on his choice of opponent. Trying to blag his way through the interview.  Must be hard when no one wants to fight you like? Well played Geordie.
For me Tyson Fury is reverting back to the character he was before he had the period out through his drinking and mental health etc after he came back from that he was a changed man very humble and likeable, seems to be turning back into the bellend he was before
Great watching lol. I'm not sure what's going on with you or Fury . But   The start of your interview with Tyson was off. I  think he said got to train in 40 mins And looked agitated.  Mabe you've said somthing bad about him in the past lol. All good stuff though..
Be good to see aj on a podcast if not already done 🤔
Geordie did a great job of being unbiased and very respectful also brining up tough questions but watching the interview if I were Geordie after the first 30seconds I would of just told Fury “hey obviously you’re not feeling this today let’s do This another time” Hahhaa but I also understand Geordi has a business to run.
Tyson acted like a prick. Chisora is a bum and he knows it
Respected the interview. However this is just overkill and makes you look sour as fuck and look the bad one now.
This made me love TG way more
Contradictions about contradictions. Fury can't handle criticism - Proceeds to go on an even worse rant about people criticising his interview. Fury has an ego - Proceeds to list people he's interviewed like it's a reflection of his own intellect. Ali-G did a whole load of interviews with highly intelligent people. I doubt they did the interviews because they were interested in anything Ali-G had to say. Fury isn't forcing anyone to buy the PPV. It's simple, if you don't agree with the fight, simply don't watch it. Fury vs Chisora should't be PPV? Probably not. But compared it to KSI vs Logan Paul PPV and it seems good value. I don't remember the PPV criticism during the commentary on that fight.
Keep being you we love it
Am I only one who can tell that Tyson Fury was just fucking about at the end?
Geordie u legend!!
I commented last time, tyson is a massive liar and very good at it he convinced everyone he has all these  issues to sell his book. My respect for tyson is dropping and has risen massively for you.
I actually rate you so much man. You’re a fucking legend. Told those cunts strait
Who else did you want him to fight. This is a tune up for usyk in the new year
Tyson throwing his toys out the pram 😂
That was a great interview with Fury. Well done. I actually thought you were too polite with him. And I think you have him sussed out.
This whole thing was flawless, I just don't get why the cancer thing was said? I have a fucking morbid sense of humour but it was just a cheap shitty joke.
😂
Absolutely brilliant big fella ❤❤❤
Good Job m8 👍
I love tyson fury but that was the worst interview av ever hired from him 🙄
Tyson has just exposed himself as a bullshitter, used to have respect for him.
North shields 👍👍👍👍
Shocked when this fight announced who on earth wants to see or pay for this one sided beat down.
You can’t win pal personal it was great not to hear the normal licky arse questions ..nice one ..
Your speaking his fans thinking true words not interested in a 3 fight is gonna win so no point.  Full respect x
It's called his dad
Comprehensively spot on with every single point. 👏👏👏👏
Chicken Fury just looking for easy pay days. 🐔🐔
Yes Geordie 🤙
True Geordie vs Fury I would pay for that 🤣🤣
True by NAME..True By NATURE   ...!.mate what an  interview.. the most honest/truthful interview   I've seen for decades, most ppl  lick arse and say things what they wanna hear  ...or can only ask certain questions ....brilliant !
Fury is a bully..we all know now you asked the questions what we all had in our mind...great job Geordie
Well done, mate. Respect to you and your interviewing.
He's not about that money, even though he's constantly flexing his watches and cars on his social media...
tyson was just angry because u took time away from him sniffing lines
Never comment on YouTube videos but never a truer word said right there!!!!!
Tyson is defo on something in this interview!
Whilst I think most of this video is True Geordie stroking his own ego, he does make some valid points.  Boxing is a small bubble and journalists have to toe the line when interviewing boxers. It's why you seldom see boxers scrutinised.
Respect for standing up 🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
Yes
Absolutely spot on. Gypsies are good at conning ordinary people
Why are you being cheeky 😂
Icl I love TG but the ppl he name I don’t now who TF he mentioned onG😂😂
Much prefer your solo content absolutely brilliant
you know you did not deserve any of what he said to you. i used to be a tyson fan but i have seen another side to him. this fight is not a worthy fight at all.  you were too kind to him. i  kind of hope he gets smashed now
We all know Umar is the biggest Fury fan boy going
There’s a tiktok that explain Fury’s reason for picking chisora
Bald calling bald there's a joke in there somewhere 🤣
Fury the British wilder
You’ve nailed this. Class act
It's definitely a fight nobody wanted...we know they are close friends, millions involved, not great for actual boxing fans.... He likes to wear a crown but kings who are surrounded by yes people lose their grip on reality...
Oh yeah I'm gonna enjoy this
Im a new Subscriber im also a fan of tyson fury but I have to admit he pissed me of with that you haven't done half of what he's done  but we all do things they don't fucking do!! He got a problem talking like that at other people we do jobs he couldn't do better then anyone of us! He there because of us and others!. I think your a fucking brilliant interviewer told the man what he didn't want to here.
Your a legend mate. More people need to speak the truth, unfortunately the truth hurts!
He should have made the AJ fight happen. It'd be a blockbuster, even if AJ has fallen away a little now, that fight should be easy enough to make.
Well said Geordie bout time someone told fury he is full of ball💩 like his bully boy dad pair of 🃏
i love this vid, no fucks like back in the day when u had 100 followers :) been a wild ride .. keep up the good work bud :)
Bruv….. he’s sniffing too much cocaine. Is it not as obvious to everyone else??
Blown out of all portion by the Daily Mail...
You’re a good egg Brian, a real one.
He is world champion with no losses so far if you are asking, who is Tyson Fury LoL...
Go on True Geordie, give it to the Big Dosser lol
you didnt need to make this video, this video makes it look like you were in the wrong, dunno if you made it to cash in on more views but you should of left it as it was and other people would bring it up for you
You spoke for all of us FANS well done! 💥🥊
North shields 👍👍👍👍👍
i think fury is frustrated because he thought ppl would do what he wanted. eg he cant get the fights he wants and cant get the questions he wants....and yes im a fan too.....shame
Massive respect to you What a great example of true authentic expression Keep on keepin the faith!
It’s funny because you used to have a criticism of being a Tyson Fanboy
where is lawrence?? havnt seen him for time
I wouldn’t agree it’s not a contest. Chisora has learned alot since the last fight and is a high level scrapper. Thing is fury’s a high level boxer. Fury’s the heavy favourite but chisora got a punching chance. For me anything to see fury in the ring who knows how much longer he’ll be fighting 🤷🏻‍♂️
Uhhh yeah I wouldn't say Tyson fury is the most dangerous heavyweight out there right now. Maybe the fastest twitch style along with the biggest cheat, and fattest heavyweight, but not the most dangerous.
Surely if Fury wants to be classed as one of the all time greats,why wouldn’t he want to smash all big hitters like AJ Usyk etc and make those fights happen
True geordie is the GOAT
Well done Brian. I for one thought you bottled a couple of moments during the original interview, but it's good to see you address these in this video. Good work Geordie 👏
Very well said man.
Fury gave me the impression he didn’t really want to do the interview,saying at the start,just to warn you you’ve only got 40 odd minutes
Amazing interview w/ Fury! Hard to find people that will call out BS when they hear it. Keep up the great work!
As one of fury’s biggest fans. I can only take my hat off to you and agree with pretty much everything you have said regarding this whole situation! Well done sir ❤
Loved the interview,I’m guessing you’d have asked the same questions if you were face to face
Thought the interview was spot on mate and like I said on the video comments you got a lot of answers to questions we all wanted to know
Doesn’t put Fury in a good light,if he met a fan in the street and they said something he didn’t like would he react same
Chisora reported me on twitter for saying i hope they both get knocked out for putting the fight on.
If you think you were awkward, it's not the questions but how you asked them!
Been a fan for donkeys but that's me subscribed!
Your comments about cancer weren’t funny, great interview with Fury showing his real self though!!!
Listened to your interview it was very professional all questions asked to me were reasonable so I will leave it at that loved it ❤
Love it
What a perfect piece of art!  Top marks ☑️ Spot on the way you explained yourself the way you did... Bravo 👌
Rogan definitely the GOAT podcaster
shouldn't every 1 be that Chisora getting a pay day
Huge respect for Fury on his comeback and fights against Wilder .. but the fight against Chisora is a steaming mile  high stack of poop and you were spot on to question it .. fight against wilder = class world champion .. fight against chisora 3  =  absolute gypsy chancer
I'd love to watch Tyson floor you!
I do think Tyson has taken the fight because no one wants to fight him but true Geordie defo has my respect for calling him out
If this fight was a film it would be straight to DVD.
🎣🎣🎣
He was desperate for an argument from the very first question! Well done on speaking the truth and not backing down to him.
Respect
Watched the full hour and half you did with jordan peterson yesterday, absolutely brilliant, im a huge fury fan but everything you said was bang in in your interview with fury and i too even as a fury fan am tired of his bullshit
The interview was Fast and Furyious
Extremely well said Geordie. Has anyone been less deserving of a title shot in heavyweight history. Chisora is definitely on the short list thanks to the Chisora Fury bromance.
You’re a disgrace pal! Shame on you. Attacking a man who suffers with mental health issues. Everyone agreeing with you is a mug who goes along with the norm, fury can do whatever he wants.
Get AJ on your podcast lad. He’s the true people’s champion
I’ve bought tickets to watch Fury. This fight keeps him active for the bigger fights next year and couldn’t get a different fight tried with AJ. Also Dubois on the undercard he has the potential to be a future world heavyweight champion. Just personal opinion, I rate Tyson Fury as one of the best heavyweights ever in boxing so it’s worth watching him while I can.
Fury acting like a big baby... robbing TWAT LOL
First thing I thought about when Fury started was how happy Brian was when he got back up in the first fight "HE'S UPP!!" I was thinking if he talked to me or any other fan like that how upset I'd be, disappointing.
Isn't Chizora one of the monsters in the Godzilla franchise?
Tyson is surrounding himself with Yes men, sycophants who say yes to him all the time. I saw the interview you did with him I thought you were straight forward and articulate and I thought he lost it because he actually didn’t know how to answer you and furthermore he was annoyed you didn’t agree with him. well I don’t agree with him either. I think he’s a contradiction and he’s a hypocrite. It’s becoming a bit boring now deadlines and all that bullshit. Btw someone remind Tyson that he’s ALSO bald. 😂
Otto wallin deserved a rematch over chisora
It had to be December the 3rd because Usyk said he would only fight early 2023 due to his religious beliefs. AJ's camp caused that fight not to happen clear as day.  The Usyk fight is more important for his legacy than facing AJ. Chisora is the oppenent because he needs a fight before due to inactivity. If his doesn't face Usyk, the True Geordie is right, otherwise he is wrong because warm up fights are part of boxing.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Well said 💯
Well done geordie handled this very well and asked questions we all wanted an professionals boxer opinion on benn and ksi
You are well-appreciated Brian. Integrity and accountability are as important as honesty, equality and transparency. Thanks for your service.🙂
I lost so much respect for fury after your interview...
It isn't being disrespectful to Del Boy to say he's a faded fighter who doesn't deserve another title shot (having lost 3 of his last 4 fights), it's just plain fact.
Great video apart from the cancer joke
I mean after the press conference with Jake Paul and Tommy Fury, you could hear how easily frustrated someone like his dad would get. Still like Tyson but it gives you an idea of how he wants this fight to just happen without people questioning it because he himself knows its a terrible matchup and he just wants to sell the fight (Which is fair). Might aswell treat this like an exhibition fight, people still pay to see them and it makes easy money which is what this is probably going to be.
Refreshing interview of fury, i hate several channels out there with cringey intros and cock sucking content, fuck fury vs chisora!!!
Tyson Fury one of the greatest heavyweights but one of the worst champions.
You have educated boxers how to rattle Tyson fury in future press conferences 😂 fair play to you for asking these awkward questions just like Simon jordan does. Too often them smoke filled asses can’t take the heat. We pay there wages we got every right to question all within the sport. You should of reminded him the Ukrainian coming to take the green belt 😂😂😂 because in the last interview he praised Del Boy for beating Usyk 😂 the pumped up middleweight!! Oleksander called him and said he is scared and I believe the true humble champ. Keep up the great work and big respect
Baldy is mad
Top man true geordie
When Tysons got his daft head on he's unbearable and very difficult to talk to never mind make a fight with. He's like that mate you've got that's a total tit with a drink in him
You were the closet thing we will get to Porky interviewing Tyson Fury. Good work.
Tyson 'The 2 faced contradiction' Fury
You did nothing wrong brother big up yourself we need more interviewers like you 💯
Massive respect for asking questions which boxing fans want the answers to especially about the chisora fight, love chisora and what he's done but I'd rather see tyson prove the skills and the talk he does by fighting a foreigner as he so politely put it, give an unknown the rocky balboa chance of being a nobody and to fight the best ?! Promote that and fight fans will take to it more than another fight where one of them is over the hill. The Joshua fight should've happened and the deadline bollocks shouldn't have been there give the people from purists to the weekend fans what they want, possibly the biggest fight in the UK , definitely of our generations
I’m looking forward to fury Chisora interesting to see how much tickets it sells
I liked this video Baldie.
About time someone has spoken up about the debar cal  that is Tyson fury! Well said True Geordie👍👍
Well Said My Guy!!!!!
Celebrity Narcissism is very real,  but NOT everyone will suck him off🤷‍♂️ Keep up the good work & don't worry about Mr. Pillow Fist🤡Fury
hate it when brian tries tries  to be funny
How tf can Tyson fight anyone when no one wants to fight him. You literally said he did not fight anyone and thats why he got pissed off. You brought him on an interview to do a promotion of his fight and book but instead you tried to be a smartass promoter and ask him useless q's. He surely musta been blindsided and thats why he asked "What are trying to get at"
Damn right True Geordie. You do you. Fuck the haters
👏👏👏👏 much respect to you for asking the tough questions.  Keep doing what you're doing 👏👏👏👏👏
Its mental to think that tyson fury has been called out for what he does by one of his biggest fans yet gets slammed by the man himself.. not a massive fan of some of the things you say but we have to give you the respect you deserve for standing up to the real question needed to be asked 👏👏👏
Thank you for real journalism. Unlike those fury IFL nut huggers
Brilliant mate. Keep up the good work. Love your content.
Get him 😂😂😂😂
This is GOLD.
I just subscribed for keeping it real👍 Well  hope you  don't have a thousand tons of flytipping outside your house🤣 you was spot on with everything you said you got more balls than Derek nearly🫣🤣well said Geordie, A great fight would have a been a rematch with otto walin his style caused Tyson loads of trouble last time he hurt  Tyson , especially if Otto's could improve tough man  rather see that than Derek the warrior👍 Big hello from Wales🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿👍
Fuuuuucking yessssss Mate I fucking love u ❤️  It's high time someone called out his bs..  To many do not ask the questions we want answered not just with fury but with all boxers.. Just a shame I doubt u will get many more interviews with others
Positive comment
Narcissist
Staging an event is a very quick way to boost ratings and paydays for both these parties involved!  Or maybe this did acrually happen. 😆 🤣
Tell um Geordie man.
Right at the beginning when he told u have 40mins u have pissed him off and not helping urself
my man true geordie kinda looks like kratos. someone should make an edit of this man as kratos.
Dillian whyte v joshua 2 . Will he get the same interview.  Or even on his comeback.   Think lad interviewing is clueless .  And don't know boxing . Who do you think he should box . What before uysk in Feb 2023 .  Wants some good prep which is chisora .  12 rounds with uysk chisora did that mate lol .   Your embarrassing yourself.
Hey bro next time you bump into Tyson out and about be honest are you go s it yourself? Tyson taps you on the shoulder next time  your at a bout?be funny seeing your face 🤣😎😁
True Geordie my respect for you has gone up by 5 million percent. Well done for simply asking him REAL questions 👏 👍
Geordie! Send Del Boy a true geordie t shirt for the presser/weigh in!!!
Fully agree with everything you said. Perfect.
WOW , true  Geordie  finally finds his balls after he swallowed  them back down after that tongue lashing  the GK gave him , lol make sure  you get those books back outta the bin before  the bin men come  & take them  , but yeah make sure you get that insurance out marra
A man who isn't willing to get in the ring and fight should not be talking like this about men who do, seems like your very jealous becuase they have something you want but don't have. And p.s if I ever see you out and about I'll personally ko you out for your behaviour.
Idk know why ppl hating on the fight nobody wanted to sign to fight tyson none of the top guys and this just a regular tune up fight to stay active common thing
This the next set up deffo lol
We all know how it goes. Give them an easy interview and big them up so they come back again and again. I was flabbergasted by the interview. Total breath of fresh air.
Do you think during the interview, Tyson had a realisation that Geordie was right, and the way to sell the fight is to create controversy?
Great job and shame upon the cretins out there licking Fury's arse. True Geordie is up there with Hatman as the most objective in the business. IFL tv should be ashamed of themselves.
I don't care about what other people say in your comments bro. I wanna hear what you think.
Continue the great work!
His skill in the ring is his explanation, and that's what you pay to see, he doesn't owe you anything. He's that good he makes professional fighters look amateur. And you slating him like you are for money says alot more about you then tyson. Like he says if you don't like it don't watch it, but you still will. Your quick enough to put Derek down with your mouth but in reality if you said it to his face he would ko you clean out becuase that's how Derek rolls.
Fair play true geordie for putting it to Tyson an telling the truth people paying hard earned money for a fight that's a foregone conclusion chisora not at that level Tyson already beaten him twice already good man brian
I went into the interview with respect for you and Fury. Fury doesn't get to be all "Jesus teaches us this" one week then call you a cock sucker when you put him in a place that makes him uncomfortable. He looked like a 6ft9 school yard bully. Sulking as he finally didnt get his way on the playground cuz the new kid (TG) stood up to him.  Tyson, grow the fuck up man.
This is exactly what the sport of boxing needed, unbiased honest interviews!  I’ve subscribed because it’s rare in this day and age that people are prepared to stand up for what’s real when it potentially loses them money. I won’t be skipping any adds I’m here for it 🙌🫡
EH UP PAL, THIS IS THE 1ST TIME I'VE EVER FELT IT NECCESARY TO COMMENT TO ANY FUCKING THING ON SOCIAL MEDIA EVER. JUST SEEN THE INTERVIEW WITH FURY, HE WAS PISSED OFF FROM THE START OBVIOUSLY, I SAW TYSON IN MORCAMBE ON MONDAY MORNING AND HE WAS THE SAME WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN ALRIGHT WITH ME AND ON MONDAY, HE WAS A PRICK, AND I FUCKING TOLD HIM. SO I GET THAT YOU WERE IN THE SAME BOAT KIDDO
I thought It was a great interview and those that wanted to diss this are the yes men for Fury. I won’t be going or watching the fight, purely because we need to take a stand against this rubbish
You know you're legit when you react to your own videos and content.
I think u litrelly just caught him on a bad day, u could see from the start he wasn't in the mood u kinda poked the bear 🤣
Lets be honest, we all knew boxing was about the money. But now we know it REALLY is all about the money, from top to fucking bottom. A protectionist racket....
Haha he was obviously joking he wasn’t angry one bit and was smiling I just think everyone took it the wrong way
TF is a great boxer but as a man he fails in many areas as a good man!
Loved this
Well played Brian 👏👏👏
You have handled this brilliantly from start to finish, well done
True Geordie has done things which should be considered normal when interviewing an athlete, to sit there and not criticise some who in some cases need questions to be answered ie Tyson Fury. I think is ignorant to think no one will pull you up on it especially in an interview Well done TG 👏🏽
Well said big man stuff that need to be said and asked 👍, fury’s a great fighter but its becoming a fcuking soap opera watching him now. Atb WULLIE ✊🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 subbed you now to 🥊
Geordie hits the nail on the head. The problem with guerilla-journalism channels like IFL is that they are entirely dependent on having good will with their subjects and can therefore not have the level of impartiality required to get to the heart of the important issues. Partisan princes.
you have a point!!!
Fury just didn’t like that someone actually called him out on a couple legitimate points, he used to most media just nodding their heads to him! His ego is out of control lately everything is a deadline or a demand for him he said it himself he is boxing!! He said those words himself!! Needs someone bringing him back down to earth 👍🏼
Well said Brian 👍 you could see from the start of the interview that Tyson was grumpy. He's used to people blowing smoke up his arse all the time and clearly doesn't like truthful questions 🤷‍♂️ Never meet your heroes 🤔 fair play for being real 👏
Dyson Fury is on the gear again
You have right my man , Im fan off Tyson fury but he can explean but not ofend .peace out
Fury is a decent boxer..nowhere near the best of all time. Talks way too much, and contradicts himself on a daily or hourly basis. He's clearly not right in the head, but lots of Travellers have a loose connection with the truth and reality. I think the Geordie lad did a fine interview with the boy Fury..and if he upset him, so what? The Chisora fight like the Whyte fight is a joke. There are a few he could have fought...but has chosen a soft fight...and HE doesn't like being called out on it.
COKE!!
when fury returned in 2018 he showed humility and respect. he seems to have regressed to this cocky egocentric character he was before. you were straight with him and he couldn't handle it.
Well done 👍
@ True Geordie. Only Larry Merchant would have dared ask those questions. He did it with Mike Tyson and Tyson & Don King tried to have him removed from HBO. You might be a YouTuber but you're more journalist than all those sycophantic shills on the boxing channels.
As a huge Tyson fury fan I'm baffled to why he hasn't taken the AJ fight and just let it happen.
This vid had me 😂😂😂😂!!
Lol  - so funny. Proper wind up merchant, love it.
He’s a traveler, enough said
I didn’t call you baldy, baldy!
I totally agreed with you in the video and I still do , not sure you needed to make fun of tyson at the start, you were better being the better man but I get it. All I will say I. Tysons defence is his mental health can be poor and jumpy and also I really do think tyson would want to fight Joshua and doesn’t particularly want this fight but he can’t really say that, I wish you could settle it with a meet or phone call in private but I do get why your using it and you should I suppose I’m your business. I mean I like tyson but when he does this whole I hate boxing, i don’t care about this and that and what the fans want firstly it makes me feel stupid for supporting him but I don’t think he’s a terrible guy but honestly I can’t do anything but respect you mate , your interview was good, your questions were strong and respectful and you didn’t back down so there’s no way I can say you weren’t In the right. It’s made me definitely want to watch more of your stuff , I was subscribed but didn’t watch kids , purely just bcos I didn’t no too much about you it wasn’t any particular reason but I must admit my respect has really went through the roof for you. I won’t lie I’m struggling a little purely only bcos I do like tyson , I just wish he could just give us the decent tyson we’ve had for a couple of years now. That’s but your fault tho. Anyways I’m rambling pish now , I will just say thank you for doing what you did as we did need to know and I honestly think there’s no person on this planet even Tyson’s friends or the biggest journalists would privately surely admit and say there is no way this should be his next fight.
Thanks for telling Fury what he needs to hear. Not many people would have the bottle to do so
Why does every Fury fight need to be super competitive while Helenius was brought in just for Wilder to have a highlight KO?
Keep up the good work True Geordie. Huge respect to you. Everything you have said is bang on. You’ve exposed Tyson Fury for the nasty person he really is. If he had any integrity he would publicly apologise to you. Please don’t change your interview technique because it’s spot on. You had the courage to ask everything we all wanted to know! Thank you.
God you got so triggered by people pointing out why your interview sucked and the way you stroked your ego out of it was embarrassing to watch.
Aye your the man bro appreciate the content 💯 ⭐️
I’m a huge TF fan, have spent £1000’s going watch many of his fights but you were bang on in your approach and subsequent response. Please please please on a lighter note can you now go and ‘interview’ Rebecca Vardy with the exact same journalistic integrity 🥊 🔥 x
Fair play.. I Like fury but u right on!... If he does knock you out when you see him be a nice pay day
Too many yes men, pally paid for gutless interviewers out there showing embarrassing envy towards you, who wished they'd ask him the questions you did but don't have the balls to so fu*k em, it takes a real one to put it on these sports and TV stars to get the answers we all subscribe and support your channel for, congrats my man for the 2 mill subs, your as real as they come, hope the success continues 👍🏻
After his comeback Fury was my favourite character in boxing and he really seemed like a man of the people. My huge respect for him is slowly turning into just disappointment. I respect you for speaking up for all the true boxing fans, and true Fury fans who want to see him fight the best and put on those shows that we'll tell our grandkids about. Hopefully this is a wake up call for him.
That interview was uncomfortable to watch. It’s impressive how you handled that, but ultimately you stood up for us in the working class who are asking Fury to justify outrageous prices for a fight no one wants to see. We love boxing but the current politics is ruining boxing.
One word…….. classic
I really don't blame Tyson watching the interview.
Massive respect for Brian here.
legend geordie
Not always Geordies biggest fan but he’s done very well with this Fury stuff
this is why i love this guy , honest and real, one of the best on the site
Can't fault the guy. Top man.
Just illegally stream it, if they are going to try rob the public let the public rob them to bits hah, He is the best of our time (Fury) but that doesn’t give him a ticket to bend his fans over at the first opportunity
This is what journalism is all about. The uncomfortable questions are the important ones, Tyson needs to change his attitude and remove the yes-men around him otherwise he will go down a slippery slope. Respect to TG for holding his own.
🔥
2 Million subscribers enough said !!! It's a typical case of he has  been giving it to everyone for the last 10 years or more and finally Brian says it how it is, and what does he do makes himself look a complete tool and chucks the toys out of his pram !! gives it but cant take, but hey its the Tyson Fury show.
Nice one mate 👍 tell them how it is tyson is a fucking sausage. You've done amazing interviews and don't let them tyson fury cock suckers tell you different 🥊🥊
It had to be done Geordie lots of dick riders in the boxing game good man🥊
For the record Ali fought lesser fighters,many many times ,he had 2 trilogies,loads of rematches at least 4 ,Tyson had tons of easy fights against bad fighters not even close to Del Boy,he got angry because of your lack of knowledge,cmon be better than this
You’re a legend Geordie cheers from Florida. The Gypsy King does what the Gypsy King wants!
Boxing fan here, you're spot on, fair play.
This video reminds me so much of classic true Geordie! Loved it!
I'm a big Fury fan but you absolutely nailed that interview, this reaction video also class. He was rude from the get go. My question is. Is it possible that his management team pressured him to have this boring trilogy nobody wants to see? I think his not the person who answers to many people (maybe his dad), but felt like he just wants to sell this fight, get over it and call it a day.
And as for interest in this fight TG, I’ve just left an American page regarding the “Tyson Fury Eric Chisora” fight  And people are tuning in - On both sides of the pond because what you just said about fury fighting - not because he wants to fight, but because he’s scared of inactivity -  Basically American sentiment seems to run along the lines of: If he wants to win against Usyk - he needs to stay active in this fight against Eric
He’s not a thick lump is he wor Geordie, a brain and balls are a good combo
Your wrong I’m afraid,all the greats took apparently easy fights,Ali,Tyson,The Klits,rocky marciano,all of them,you showed massive disrespect,you are not a boxing historian  I do like a lot of your content,but I’m sorry this makes you look bad
Pmsl, i love this. KUDOS BUDDY
Huge respect Brian. You’ve got serious balls and prove it time and time again
Let's just assume for a second that this guy fighting Fury would make more money... take a moment to think what the reason for that might be?  "That's ironic right?" Wrong.
Used to love Tyson and hate true Geordie but now I hate Tyson and don’t mind true Geordie
Geordie your a legend!!
Brilliant interview. First one I’ve seen of yours and I was applauding you throughout the interview. Perfect questions, ones that everyone wants answered. Tyson is a great fighter but when it comes to being intellectual I’m afraid he’s a tad short. I think Tyson was frustrated because he knew he was being cornered with your questions. Reasonable question of which he had no real answers. Embarrassing really.
To be honest True Geordie would probably would have had more respect for Tyson if Tyson just said the Derek fight is just a filler to keep active and to give Derek a fighting chance, not to make this fight out to be whats its not. Huge RESPECT to True Geordie!!!
Was he not messing ? Like the bald comment is a pisstake
You’re so right on this! Tyson came across as a fucking dick
Chisora like Nate Diaz will take any fight and is a beast but not up to the top level
tyson would knock u out sis chill
Mad Respect to you, Fury showed his true colours! never have liked the bloke.
Way to make content out of content bloke
Legend mate 👏🏼
Tyson's egos so big he's the type of person to go and get knocked out on purpose to prove himself right. Watch this space...
Bookies odds on fury to beat Chisora is 1/20 on! That tells you everything you need to know
Fury and TG in a CarPark make it Happen!👊👍🤣
Absolutely spot on Geordie!
While I may be in the minority, I found the repeated badgering of Fury to be utterly frustrating. We all know that it´s a stay-busy fight, so who the hell does this guy think he is to harass the HW champ over a voluntary defence? How many "bums" did Ali defend the title against?  Fury has had three wars with Wilder in the past four years, not to mention his KO of  Whyte. Sure, he´s not active enough, but to sit and repeat the same question (only using different words every time) for 15 minutes and not expect a reaction....well, at least you got the hype. Personally, I´d rather be respectFUL to the champ thaN be respectED by a bunch of boxing fans that think the HW champ actually owes them something. Newsflash, he doesn´t. The man gets punched in the head for a living. Let him make as much money, for as little risk, as possible. Not interested in the fight? Don´t bloody pay for it, then. It´s simple. The man owes nothing to the fans and even less to a guy like this, who appears to think he´s hard cause he´s covered in tattoos or clever because he keeps repeating the point.  The Usyk and Joshua fights will happen when the timing is right. Now, clearly, is not the time. But of course, the big True Geordie feels he´s representing the people while he badgers a man for fighting a bloody tough man. Absurd.
Just spot on mate
I remember finding true’s channel thanks to Spencer back when they did a football manager series together and I’ve been subbed ever since
When you really think about it, boxers dont owe us anything as fans. We pay a fee and in exchange they put their lives on the line and we get 12 rounds of entertainment.   If you dont like the fight then yeah, just dont buy the ppv. If you buy the ppv and you dont think its worth it then it's on you - nobody is forcing you to buy it.  As a fan base we gotta stop acting like the fighters owe us something
Love Geordie
People like GAD (Gareth A. Davies) are not practicing journalism, but PR.  It's all based on being chummy with fighters, and if you get too close to these people, your ability and desire to properly critique them goes away.  Praise to TG for asking the follow-up questions that so many publicists like GAD refuse to do.  Fury's personality has become grotesque, he's surrounded by yes men and hearing anything that clashes with the fantasy world he lives in sets him off.
Still can't believe the Chisora fight is ppv
I think Tyson is fully aware of the YouTube boxing scene, not least because his brother is desperately trying to get into it. And he is upset that this new scene is more interesting than heavyweight boxing.  Others involved in boxing are embracing it, and Tyson seems to resent it. Either doesn’t know to match make, or more likely, wants to pick his opponents strategically even more than Jake Paul does.
On your side✌️🖖
FURY as seemed rattled ever since he got turned back from the U.S
McKenna’s got yer back😉👍……………way back, but fvck it✌️🖖
What a fantastic podcaster you are. 🤜🤛  Love your straightforward, honest, intelligent chat. So natural.   2 best pods I’ve watched in a long time. 👍
Yeah, pretty much agree, will I do agree with all what you said! LOL!
Easy money double up😂😂legend
Respect to you Bri, great bit of journalism
Top bants Brian ❤️ it
I can't lie mate, I thought that I was a huge Tyson Fury fan, but recently it seems his true colours are coming out. It's clear to me that his comeback story was a load of bollocks, he didn't deal with half of the things he has talked about.   He is no longer the number 1 heavyweight in my eyes, taking a fight against Chisora at this stage is just embarrasing, especially for the self claimed best heavyweight of our era. Fight the top of the new era then if you're that good. He's clearly lost his mind, and lost a lot of money in his bank account. He's 100% lost a fan, and a supporter in me and I'm sure in a lot of other people too. Embarrasing.
I think you listened to the boxing news podcast??
Spot on.
Well said
Breath of fresh air in boxing journalism, boxers will avoid the geordie!!!
Tyson needs to beat Usek imo to be the GOAT, such a different fighter to everyone else and also needs to fight AJ just to get it done
This talentless mong is going to dine out on this for the rest of his life... facts are AJ and Usyk aren't fighting anyone until next year and both turned down offers from Fury.  Wilder just fought his mate Helenius, AJ will fight Whyte for a third time next year after Fury KOd him and Chisora did better against Usyk than AJ did. Tyson deserves an easy payday after a trilogy with a man who would spark AJ out in one round. Stay salty sheeple.
Tyson is one of my favourite all time boxers I genuinely think he’s the best heavyweight ever (matter of opinion) but I can’t seem to disagree with anything true geordie states here fair play to him sticking to he’s guns first interview and coming out again to express his opinion he’s only stating what 90% of boxing fans think.
Mad respect TG
The way Tyson jumped in with "right I've only got 40 minutes so..." let me know immediately that he shouldn't be doing interviews. No blame on Brian here, it did feel like he could have backed off but I think that's more to do with what we're used to seeing from boxing journo's who want to keep it pally. Well done for maintaining integrity in a stressful, hostile situation.
I've been a huge fan of Tyson for years and a huge fan of yours for a long time. You're right about the entire situation, you showed respect but as an interviewer, you have a responsibility to ask tough questions. Tyson might have thought you would go easy on him because you're on YouTube.
I’d love another Louis Theroux podcast. That was absolute top tier content and I’ve watched it multiple times.
But is it not just the case that Tyson said he wants to be active and wants to fight in december no matter who its with and with AJ's team not being happy with the commercial side of the contract they pulled out and Usyk said he wont be ready to fight this year im sure chisora was just a stay active fight till Usyk next year ?
you come across as a really cool guy, respect for the way you handled the interview
As a South African I'm more excited to see Kevin lerena than that Tyson vs Chisora...it's a pay day fight for Tyson and Chisora
Tear him apart that fake conman TG.
I have now subscribed to your channel. Enough said. Well done man
"Making this video because its easy money" ... Fair fucking play brother, thats the kind of honesty I need in my life! TG is the GOAT, Fury should apologise
First time watching you and last time, you seem to twist a lot just to impress the little kids who follow you
Listen geordie you complete numpty. Absolute facts that the interview was horrendous because of your opening question.  Simple as that don't defend yaself because ya can't. I was cringing with embarrassment that you actually asked the big man about ksi honestly it's plucking ridiculous..
Finally someone putting that contradicting twat in his place fury talks so much 💩 and at least The big man has the balls to put it on tyson not kissing his ass 👏
FairPlay 👏👏👏👏
People want to love Tyson but it'd be easier if he wasn't hostile and high handed with people for asking him challenging questions once in a while.
Good job Brian. Keep fighting the good fight. 👍
Brilliant keep it going. Fury I a bully boy that surrounds himself with lick arses and yes men. Fury is like his old man, a compulsive liar and there noses get longer every time they open there mouth like pinnocho.  Your the best interviewer on you tube , real questions and make them answer. Respect from ireland 🇮🇪
All the combat sports world know who Tyson Fury is. Who is this other idiot? Why highlight a beef Tyson has with a nobody?
Geordie you’re the man. Agree with what you said. Well done for having the balls to ask the important questions.
Class😂😂😂😂
Tyson fury is a typical “do as u likely “
Tyson was piss off from that start of that interview when he said I only got 40 mn
Two Words: Well Said   Great interview, and great comeback video. Gained a new subscriber
This started out quite good and made me laugh.   But then you said about his ego as he mastered something in one field that you haven’t.. which i agree with. However, you then did the same thing to people leaving negative comments. Saying they don’t do podcasts or journalism… and you came across a bit like Tyson did…   By the way I didn’t leave any negative comments. I just watched the previous video and laughed.
That's why the call him TRUE GEORDIE!
this dude should rename himself to true ballsy
Congratulations on 2 mil
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Well said true geordie you got yourself a sub keep up the good work brother
Brilliant, Geordie. Keep at it brother.
Iv just started following True Geordie; honestly best interview putting Tyson on his toes & doing what journalism is all about as the existing people in the game don’t ask the questions fight fans want
I'll be impressed when you do a reaction video to the reaction video of someones reaction video
here comes the classic geordie who will milk this for all its worth
Headshot, bang, done!
Agree with you it wasn't that foul and Tyson was pretty good in that interview I got where he came from
Absolutely banging mate fully bang on with everything you’ve said hopefully this has a very low PPV sales so they then understand and he was saying about ticket sales i guarantee you there all been brought to be flipped.
Well done true Geordie!!! All Tyson fury does is contradict him self he's the KING 👑 at bullshit
Fair play true Geordie well said again
Fantastic TG. Bang on the money as usual
Love your passion!
Really hope that Fury’s reaction circulates the internet enough to be spoken about on the JRE, no such thing as bad publicity especially with how excellently TG dealt with it. Top Bloke
WOW! Fair play to you!!  MOST DEFINITELY WHAT IT SAY'S ON THE TIN!!??                    "TRUE GEORDIE!!"   LOL!!!
Nail on the head.
I don't follow boxing at all but thought it was a great interview. Tyson looked agitated from the very start of the interview and I always felt he was going to lose his temper. He looked like he thought you were beneath him
Fury is the ultimate alpha and it’s you sitting there bitching about fury loving money. He’s a G, the ego gained from a YouTube channel can’t compare to the ego and alpha status of a Tyson Fury.
Spot on
Congratulations Brian on calling out the bullshit!!!!! Fury certainly didn’t like it as he’s completely surrounded himself with yes men and is not used to people asking the awkward questions that need to be addressed.
you have been the only interviewer with the bollocks to ask what every true Boxing fan has wanted answers to for years... there is no doubting Fury's ability in a boxing ring, just a shame he doesn't have the same class outside of it... Well done True Geordie..
60 seconds in and this video is already legendary!!!
One of the culprits for criticizing you was Gareth Davies. He is a bellend mate
How come he is wearing headphones?
Love it mate and your spot on in both videos 👌
Yeah Tyson is jealous of you you muppet lol
How much of a dick are you gonna look if chisora knocks him out,
The whole podcast/youtube world is a circus,all a bunch of no lifes looking for attention due to their insignificant lives, lacking self esteem, looking for social status, no moral fibre!! But thats by the by, its the sheep, the lowest part of the food chain the rats in a cage, looking for an attachment in their lives, following FOLLOWING LIKE SHEEP! What has happened to people?? Podcast full of negativity, crime and heathenous activities, honestly you virus ridden lot make me puke! Embarrassing!!!!
Some valid points made by Brian but I don't like how angry and twisted he is.
Fury doesn't deserve respect, he's a compulsive liar who respects NO ONE. No drug cheat deserves respect
Absolutely criminal that this is on a PPV.  Also criminal that Fury bitches about AJ losing 3 fights when Chisora lost 3 in a row in the middle of his last 5.  Garbage.....thank god for free streams :p
You mentioned Ali - but he has some easier fights
Outstanding mate. Absolutely spot on. Incredibly thought out points that you can’t really argue with
Well done pal! Others ought t grow sum bollox!
You were very respectfull with Him its true, maybe even too much
Hey TRUE GEORDIE (Bri) I'm from Middlesbrough, us North easteners are the Kings at winding people up 🤣 Even though know one understands us, if we speak in our propa accents 🤣🤣
No longer a man of the people :( shame.
Tyson's sniffed up t eyeballs!
Class act mate, just to reiterate what everyone else was saying, you composed yourself very well, very well interviewed man.
Your Fury interview was very truthful and honest. Fury took it as disrespectful because he wants his way or the highway , so no he’s not a peoples person but an actual big overgrown bald bully who contradicts himself in everything he says. He’s an ego maniac who’s losing control!
Well done geordie i thought u were bamg on big kenny from scotland
You showed him up in a way hes been needing to be for a long time mate, i credit you so much for it
Gyppos don't come from nothing. Most of em r loaded
I'm new to your channel and just want to say you are 100% correct with everything.  Great vid.
I have so much respect for you not being an ass-kisser and actually asking him some real questions (even though you were still very respectful)  I am so sick of other interviewers literally licking his ass constantly. And shock horror, he can't take it. I have always been a massive fan of Fury but let's be honest, he is a total bullshitter, talks absolute nonsense all the time and tbh i don't think he actually is a decent person. He is a compulsive liar
BRILLIANT..  Good man   also a big boxing fan.. 2nd to Rugby League which needs a huge shot in the arm for exposure   you should definitely get some of the top rugby league guys on for an interview
Can't understand why tyson isn't just honest about the chisora fight. It's just a keep busy fight. It's all the lieing that people hate.
The disrespect
Isn't it is a bit hypocritical to kick off at the people who have criticized you for this interview. They're also entitled to their opinion, right? That's you're whole point around your opinion of Fury Vs Chisora.   Your opinion of their opinion might be that you don't like it, but it doesn't mean they're morons. My opinion of your opinion of their opinion of your interview tactics is that they should be allowed to say whatever they want to you, as you should to Tyson.   ... Opinion
Get off your high horse,you were right,Tyson was in the wrong.end of.
Afraid you sound like a hater and were goading Fury to obtain the clickbait. We all know about the fight, you were stating the obvious, nothing clever in your questioning, only public disrespect to the champ along with a bad tone. Fury deserves respect and has put UK heavyweight boxing on the world stage, not seen since Lennox Lewis. It's a tune up fight, get over it! Reacting to your own video and name dropping is egotistical. Enjoy your 5 minutes of fame, Tyson will be spoken about for generations along with the other boxing greats.
Fury’s team will probably reach out to you to arrange another interview before the fight to help generate some audience figures and restore fury’s image. I feel like Fury was expecting you to kiss his arse the whole interview and like he said there was around 40 minutes slot for you to chat and when the questions wasn’t what he wanted to me as a viewer he looked like he was waiting his time answering them. So Geordie is bang on the money and had the balls to call him out on it. Fair play I’m still a fury fan but as a guy who will fight any man anywhere anytime doesn’t realise he will only sugarcoat the bullshit for so long.
His body language etc showed he wasnt bothered about interview, showed little interest from from the start and didn't even attempt to give any sort of constructive reply. For a professional boxer, he showed very little control or respect and showed how easy it is to get under his skin without that even being the intention. If you dont want to answer questions that are legitimate questions, don't do a fucking interview. Did he think you were gonna sit there kissing his ass for 10 minutes telling him how great he is etc? I think he knew what he was doing. Look at the controversy its caused and the publicity hes getting cos now so many people are talking about it. Best thing you can do mate, is stop giving it your time and attention now. Its just adding to his free publicity.  You were talking to him as a fan ffs!!!
Been a big big Tyson Fury fan for over 10 years, well thats down the pan now enit? Absolute plum - im with you Geordie, keep up the good work & congrats on the milestone.
😂I stand with you i also am a Tyson fan but I won’t the fucking AJ fight we all do
Typical youtuber, getting views by putting a famous person in the title
Mate you asked the question all of us wanted asked hats off to you for it new follower now
About the genius in one field issue; this is often called “Nobel Prize Syndrome”. People with Nobel Prizes often take their identity as geniuses and think it applies to everything
The guys brain is fried. He doesn’t care about his legacy but he is fighting Chisora again to become the 1st man to have 2 trilogies 😂😂
You don't have to be a boxing expert to see that Fury is not the greatest boxer of all time, not by a mile.
Well done
Spot on, IFL and behind the gloves etc are all scared to ask the questions because they depend on a good relationship with fury to prop up their channels.  Which I totally understand tbh.  As fury will just not do any more interviews if he’s not asked the right questions and for a solely boxing based channel that’s a disaster as he’s the champ that everyone wants to hear from. So well done asking the questions 🤜💥
Brian only know how to speak facts
hope this is also number #1 trending 🔥
We have to remember though, boxing journalists it’s their full time job. They need to “keep them happy” cause a “not doing an interview with you again” takes food off their table. It’s why we needed you, cause you don’t need him.
Fury looks to me like he's been on the Peruvian snuff again. Announcing your retirement is a damn good way of making sure you don't get drug tested... It's out of your system in a matter of days too...
I liked the video as whole until the end when you turned into Ron Burgernday I’m a pretty much a big deal people know me 😂😂 I was agreeing with you all the way until the end when you started name dropping all your big name interviews. Putting yourself above people the same way you poked at Fury for doing that.  👍
Nah yeah im a massive fury fan but its really fucking hard to be a fan especially flirting with a 4th fight with wilder is just fucking ridiculous.
You can be a tosser at times Geordie but absolutely nailed this from start to finish. Fair play 👍 Agree with everything you’ve said.
“I have csncer” that killed me bruv😂
The actual interview was, or seemed, heavily edited. That makes me wonder what else was going on? I agree with others that Tyson looked well annoyed from the start, I think you sensed that and were a little harder edged than you'd normally be - to compensate, almost sensing the fight- ha. Finally, wearing just a vest to interview "the champ" gives off a certain vibe too. Overall, a great match up. Keep it coming big bro.
me me me
I have watched all the videos and still agree with Tyson. You shouldn't be able to manipulate fights YOU want out of CHAMPS even if it means undermining Pro's just because you have a platform and a Mic. Tyson did want to fight everyone but just because he won't suck balls whilst doing it, doesn't give you that right to do him dirty like that. The DISRESPECT  is insane here. Like he said if you wanna buy then buy that's fair but don't dictate to Champs what they should do. The worse part is that you don't see that at all even after rewatching your interview. Just stop the constant approval-seeking and be real for a minute bro. Still think your channel is GREAT.
Get up there lad 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Tyson is a legend .. But I've never known another boxer that contradicts himself so often and speaks so much Bullshit😆
no one wants to see you v fury, im happy chisora is getting his payday. Im sure you have had plenty of youtube boxing offers but you stuck to commentating and still got dropped from that
Tysoe is same as all boxers. Claim its an even fight but then say they know they will batter the other person and that their better than them etc lol
Cocaine is a helluva drug....
I know I wouldn’t put it on a 6”9 heavyweight champion of the world like this. Fair play! Maybe don’t sit ringside at his next fight
there was mic drop after mic drop in this video!!! bravo!!! I really appreciated your honesty, and much respect!!
Someone’s getting throttled on sight 🤣
I dont see why he is being given so much stick about this fight he wants to stay active usyk is unavailable aj fight didnt happen joyce has just fought he won't fight parker as they are mates he has beat wilder twice done whyte there really isn't anyone to fight so is he supposed to sit on his arse for 6 to 7 months
👏
It was clear from the first second fury was in a shitty mood! TG CRUSHED THIS INTERVIEW!!!
Come and advertise Life Insurance via our business mate - we can't pay you fuck all but I'll put the phone down in a timely manner
Fantastic video and fantastic podcast episode, asking the questions that boxing fans want to see. Also on a plus note congrats on 2 mill subs you deserve it.
Great interview! Good work! 👍
Big Fury fan but great video👍
The guy made you look like a straight up b****
Heavyweight boxing is a shambles at the moment, Fury is just the best of a bad bunch. A prime Mike Tyson, Lennox, Bowe, Holyfield etc. Would wipe the floor with him and any one else in that division.
Love Tyson to bits but u stood up to him asked what everyone wants to hear and he acted like a pure child good on u for sticking up for ur self he was embarrassing
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏼 Tyson talks fuckin bollocks
“ some of us ain’t afraid to talk about having an easy pay day Tyson “ 🤣😂
That interview is the exact reason why we all love and appreciate your content. Is north east lads don’t beat around the bush!
Why are most of the comments in this section from Bots? Click the profile names to see what I mean. TG is an internet master lol
Keep going lad
That's  better comedy than most stand up comedians provide , also good points
We live in a world now where, because of commercial interests, people are not asking the right questions. You only have to see how much people pussy foot around Frank Warren.  Great interview from TG. All the right questions asked. Tyson unfortunately just wants to have his cake and eat it.
Love fury but it’s about time someone put it on the walking contradiction
He has bipolar buddy....he probably knows where you live by now...,.
To be fair to Tyson, he promised Chisora a 3rd fight years ago.  No surprises it is happening.  As for December 3rd deadline, a man needs to earn money when he has mouths to feed.  If AJ won't fight, he has to fight someone.  It's business.  As for Tyson's unpredictability, anyone with any empathy would understand how his mental issues are a contributing factor.
Tysons thinking I canny  stand this guy....
TJ was on point, TF needs to fight AJ Usyk and Ruiz Jr thats it clear division and maybe go as greatest in my opinion ,you just earned a subscriber  TJ
Speaking straight facts, you're fully qualified to talk to a Fury marra. Obviously. Toon Toon, black and white army !
True Geordie don't need that c*nt.
Get yourself on the joe rogan podcast, it would be wicked! Keep up the good work 🤜
Needed to be said to Fury, seen him with White and Jordan a few times and they're so terrified to piss him off. Yes Tyson, no Tyson, three bags full Tyson...
You were very respectful to him. Fury was a disgrace. He is not a nice guy at all. And is a compulsive liar.
2m, wow, gotta be red panty night😁
The next Joe Rogan,brilliant bigman.
Brian you are a legend ! You have covered and have answered all the critics with fair justification and facts . Keep up the good work. I thought Simon Jordan was at your level with his questioning regarding Conor Benn and Hearn however  he has said nothing about your interview because it seems he is a Tyson Fury yes man
Fury & chisora are from a different era haye & klitchko we’re the champs when they came up aj , Joyce and usyk turned pro a lot later fury & chisora have just stuck around
You proper rattled him. He has been shown up to be a massive hypocritical fool
Who the hell do you think you are, to ''demand more'' from the heavyweight champ of the world? to tell him what to do, who he should fight, when & where...next you'll be telling him what time he should go to bed....shut your fookin mowthh!
Didn't realise you'd interviewed such high profile names thought it was just boxing folk! Will have a watch of all your previous vids now .. noice!
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Used to live this show till true geordie turned in to a media diva.  Would love Tyson and him to do a other face to face chat again see how smug he is then .what a prick
Spot on Brian - thanks for saying what we’re all thinking
100 percent agreed
Not bald by choice, that looks like it's tattooed on.
Not going to lie i dont know if it was but it seemed like jokingly banter
Absolutely bang on, we should be pleased someone has pushed Fury, not pissed off.
Before Deontay Wilder fight - Tyson spent the whole time convincing everyone he could beat Wilder Before Chisora fight - Tyson spent the whole time convincing everyone Chisora could beat him  Says it all
Love all your content, keep it up u legend
would you do another fifa series
👍👍👍👍
Very interesting to see how you couldn't give enough gushing praise  to him when you initially interviewed him a while back but now your going on like the rest of these clout chasing Muppets, too big for boots comes to mind, disappointing mate
Brilliant video
True Geordie, you are epic. How you interviewed Fury was spot on. He is soooo arrogant whereby he so absorbed in his own hype. He wouldn’t be in this position if he existed in the 70’s, 80’s & 90’s as fighters such as Tyson who would’ve knocked him out in 1 round in his prime. Others such as Lewis, Holyfield & Bowe would have dismantled him.  He only seems special in this era because it’s relatively poor in comparison to that time. I used to be amused by this prat’s ignorance, but like a lot of people, I’m just sick of the garbage that comes out of his mouth!
pot calling kettle black ironic by the end as it seems like you have a lot of sackless friends sucking up to you ego showed a bit. Other than that good content good man
Your loved winding him up why ask daft question did you watch ksi 😂 then asking about Connor benn come on he's not on to talk about them, you have got loads more people looking at your videos well done you 👏👏👏
The peoples champion
Unless someone dies, no one will remember this fight. It's a nothing fight - am I going to watch it? Probably. Am I going to pay for it? No.
Well done mate ballsy interview keep it up...i hope he sees it in the end for what it was... you doing your job an asking relevant and difficult questions.. it ain't always going to be nice and comfortable doing that.....respect
Go on Brian, you fucking legend!
Tyson was not his charismatic self in this interview, he was clearly being an asshole, i also have to ask though, if Usyk and AJ dont want to fight him, then who is left? Andy Ruiz maybe?  Luis Ortiz perhaps? i dunno? whatever the case, i have no interest in the Chisora fight either, i cannot believe that is being put together
"jordan peterson the heavyweight individual"
All travelers go off legacy to
The only "Brutally Honest" boxing video I've ever seen despite IFL using it as clickbait for every single interview title. You've put them to shame.
Your the fuckin man bro keep it up
Ladies and gentlemen... True fucking Geordie. A clear example of being able to defend yourself and not backing down to bullshit. I speak for everyone when I say my respect for you has grown.
You made Tyson Fury look like the tit he is.  Well done 👏 ✔️
Should have took the higher ground mate and just gave him respect. Disappointing the way you talk about the best Heavyweight on the planet for clicks.
Fury has always been a contradiction this is nothing new but let’s be honest of all the ppvs that happen these days how many are actually worth it I’d say barley any the paying fans are constantly ripped off.
geordie making jokes about cancer, hope karma comes around right
You knew he was miffed from the get go, how about dya wanna do this some other time Tyson. It was clear to see by anyone, but you still went ahead perhaps knowing the response you would get from Tyson- along with the views, etc. Tyson halo isn't glowing from this, but yours isn't either in my opinion.
Hahahaha fucking quality this mate😭 fair play
All the moaning and crying will stop when he fights Usyk in March April.. Going on like this is his last fight lol look at the bigger picture man but lovely for your £ payments from YouTube lol
Don’t flatter ya self nobody would want watch you pal go fight someone who has called you out 👀
I don’t understand why Tysons so salty about the chispra fight. Seems very out of character which leads me to agree with Geordie more
I wouldn't pay-per-view to watch any fight on TV, even if it was Godzilla V King Kong.
Thought I heard that Bald by choice argument before…. tourner de La vide
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 great job
Good luck next time you see Tyson 😂
Look, Tyson could have avoided all of this if he didn’t give us fans the prospect of the AJ fight. If he’s have just said. I’m fighting Usyk early next year, I need a warm up fight to get rid of the ring rust, I’m gonna fight Del Boy. No one would have complained.
Why didn't you ask Peterson any probing questions?  You allowed him to go on a 90 minute monologue. So you do pick and choose.
Geordie you did what other interwiers was afraid to do,simply beacuse they want interviews in the future with Fury. You did not care and you stood up for yourself.Keep doing the good work and ask the tough questions.
Would you have acted the same if it was in person? Not trying to knock you, I liked the interview and agree with everything you said.
Glad to see Fury squirming for once. Trying to justify that BULLSHIT of a fight. He’s on GMTV this morning, it’s clearly not selling tickets. We need more interviews like yours, keep it up big man 🥊🥊👍🏻👍🏻
You’re f……d
Well In mate. you tell them all. I have waited for year for someone to ask Tyson Fury these sort of questions :)
Thank you as a long time boxing fan (more than 30 yrs) it's refreshing to see a boxer surrounded by 'Yes' men being held accountable for decisions that are impacting the very people who not only pay his wages but have also opened up more opportunities in life than he ever thought his hard work would produce. We deserve a voice and your interview with Tyson was the first I recognised as an intelligent and honest interview. First thing I did during the interview was liked and subscribed.  Pat yourself on the back cause you're doing a an amazing job if all you're interviews are as engaging and honest as that one was.
Killed him with logic, 100% truth
Tyson is a nutter. He can box but that's it.  And he's a pussy. Too afraid to fight Joshua or Usyk. These self made deadlines are just excuses. These fights are large and there are tons of people involved. Each top fighter knows it.
What really enjoys me about Tyson is that he cannot pronounce the name of his own drink properly! Its 'furocity' not 'furyocity'!
He was insulting you because you were indirectly insulting him. It’s really that simple.
Hope to see you in the next Video 🥺❤️ only If Tyson doens't get you 🥺 you said the truth and it butt hurt him.
Would love to see him say it to face to face or how geordie would react around him in. Person your sus geordie
Just one thing you are wrong on. You missed him when you asked why there wasn't a deadline got Chisora he said "because Chisora agreed to everything straight away"
love to see ya face to face with people when asking those questions lol
😂😂😂 True Geordie Vs Tyson Fury I would Actually Pay For That 😂be entertaining press conference
Think your being a bit hard on derek to be fair. They fought in 2014. Derek retired in the tenth. What your saying is Derek has got worse and Tyson has got better? Neither of which I think is true.
If he and Chisora want to fight for an easy payday and to keep active, fine. What's annoying is to pretend it's a competitive fight, let alone PPV event. Especially coming from Fury.
It's wasn't a contradiction- it was poetry 😌
Agree with everything you said here except the ‘you shouldn’t charge the public for this fight’. He can do whatever he likes, and so can the public, if they don’t want to watch it because it’s a boring fight surely they won’t buy it so it won’t matter.
Yes Geordie honestly keep asking the questions man that's what we want and these reactions just show how petty both fury and other people can be keep it up you're doing an awesome job love hearing an honest opinion on things
Mate, you don’t need any validation. Your fans and listeners are your validation. You put the questions that so called ‘journalists’ are afraid to. Furthermore, you challenge answers when they need to be challenged. You are a breath of fresh air mate. And like you, I’m a boxing and therefore, Fury fan.
Haha terrorised fury there !
Boxing fan here, absolutely spot on mate. The boxing "new media" would never have asked the questions for fear of losing access to him for future interviews. He needs to fight Usyk and nobody else. This "not in my era" business is laughable, they are both holding versions of the world title at the same time ffs. Well done fella, proper bit of journalism 👏 👍
Fury gonna lose just to prove you wrong
Being pedantic... Fury sending a contract to Crisora, for the pointless fight in December 3rd, stopped negotiations for the AJ fight. Yes Matchroom stopped responding to George Warren. However, they had concrete evidence Fury wasn't interested in the fight. Deadlines and then actively making a different fight ie the Crisora. Cant blame a global company for not wanting to waste their time.
Mohammad Ali the most famous boxer of all time had 2 trilogy fights at heavyweight, ken Norton and joe frazier…. Not quite the historian he claims to be 😂
Love this
FACTS!!!!!!!
Your right to ask any questions  but you will still buy the ppv 🤣🤣🤣
how a hero can become a zero just for yt likes wow
Well said fury attitude was arrogant from first second you did a great job pal
Love you geordie you are a great interviewer and will forever be my favorite entertainer.
Shot brutha!!!👊
🎤 drop 👏🏻 well said, it’s a shame all journalists don’t approach interviews with politicians in the same way.
Tyson Fury is playing the fans and u called him out on his bs.  👍
Hindsight's a wonderful thing but the only thing missing from the interview is that you didn't go all out and roast him back at the end. It was gold but it would've been platinum.
Man of the people, Tyson Fury. its all a front! Mental health, giving 10k away. Its all bollox it really is to hide the true Tyson, Not a nice person at all and the last 5 mins of your interview with him is the true Tyson!
I’m a fury fan and I do think he’s the best heavyweight right now but since klitschko (2015) he’s fought 2 top ranked heavyweights 🤷‍♂️
Every word you just said is pure sense! I am sick and tired of so called journalists interviewing so called stars like a lap dog! Well bloody done!
Why’s this guy acting like a victim? When he showed no respect 😂😂 wat a clown 🤡
Not gonna lie I would be more excited to see TG v Fury than chisora 🤣🤣🤣
So who was he meant to fight? He wants to fight Usyk next year because Usyk said he didn’t want to fight in December, it’s now clear AJ never wanted the fight which he pretty much has stated himself….Joyce has recently fought and wouldn’t be ready in December.  Fury has picked this fight so he doesn’t build up ring rust and because the two other best boxers have declined December
Would love to see True Geordie in Tyson Fury’s shoes… would fail with those bollocks of his! 50k tickets already sold for a warm up fight says a lot… meanwhile these YouTubers would do anything to sell views… like Chisora I suppose this guy has hit the jackpot using Fury name!
I understand why you would have wanted to make this follow up, but honestly I don’t think it was needed.  The first interview spoke for itself and people will make their opinion of it.  I don’t think that opinion would have changed much with the follow up.  I personally think you did well, and I didn’t take the beef at the end to mean anything - it’s just Tyson being Tyson.  Let’s not forget that he’s in the middle of a training camp so all fired up.  I don’t think you needed to explain yourself in my view, but all good man.  Keep doing what you do 👍
Get on sky Brian tell em all truth
Geordie is  spot on. Furys come out of this a bit of a D&^%
😎👏
tyson fury bridge is on fire
You don't need to defend yourself mate, you asked everything that needed asking but others are to scared, well done
I'm on my own journey I'm fighting bkb in December give me a follow guys I have mental health nd I'm an ex addict.  Tg is a great guy love his stuff ect respect 🙏 👏 👍
Joe rogan is the best
Brian your defence of the situation fired me up this morning 😂 see you on the next one lad 👊🏽
Fury lost it mate gone down in my estimation tbf dont think i like him no more
Thanks, kugans’ crying now.
He was actually joking tho he didn’t actually go in on you
Massive fury fan but have to say u asked  the right questions hats off to you mate
🙌🙌🙌🙌 Personally I think what you said needed to be said, I think you exposed him a bit and asked the right questions. Anyone who hates fuck them let them hate. You don't need to explain yourself your doing your job. And doing it very well.
How long do yall reckon Brian would last against Tyson?
You asked stupid questions Brain
I saw Tyson purse his lips at the start of your interview.  It was an interesting mannerism. Didn't look partial to the interview from the get go
This is why Ali was so Special. The Greatest.
i just wanna see Tyson destroy the  midget with the belts
Who cares.
Only parts of this I disagreed with:  1. The argument about being ripped off with ppv for this fight. This ain’t out of the ordinary in the current landscape. DAZN is now shafting people for ppv fights regularly after Eddie said it wouldn’t happen. We also get a lot of ppv fights on sky that aren’t ppv worthy i.e £20 for AJ in a keep busy fight vs Takam ? Nah. Whyte vs Rivas a ppv fight ? Nah.   2. You went in on Fury not taking criticism well because of his yes men, then you angrily reject the tiny amount of criticism you got for the video (objectively looking some of it valid, some of it not…imo)
It’s about time someone had the balls to call fury out, he’s the biggest contradiction in world sport
I'm a huge fan of tyson fury. I think he's definitely the best of his era. But true geordie is right about everything asked. In fact I think fury himself knows Brian was right, even while throwing the insults you see fury smirking. I think it's just his way of not answering the questions and deflecting away from it.
Don't be nasty they've sold 50k tickets already!    To StubHub
Did you watch Jake vs Silva
Amazing geordie lad i like tyson but you literally put him straight and he did not like that!
Just keep doing what you are doing my man. You’ll be the one creating legacy mate 😉👊👍👌👏
Never watched your podcast but am of course aware of who you are. Subscribed and are now a big fan after your interview with Tyson and this video. Thank you so much for asking the questions no one had the balls to ask.
Tyson is generous with his time, honest as he is permitted to be,  excellent at what he does, he is a winner.
You don’t have to justify yourself Brian. You were brilliant with Tyson last week and this video just tops it. Been a fan of yours for years, keep it up bro
You acting like you are oblivious to why Tyson came into the interview with an attitude. You insulted Tommy and picked fucking KSI to win against him 🙄
True Gordie your my new best friend iv been thinking and saying that stuff about Tyson Fury for years Neva been a fan of is a Neva will. And I'm a huge boxing fan
What I find ironic is the fact he is doing a charity single for mental health and yet he goes round doing that to people 🤦🏼‍♂️😂
As a Sunderland lad I never thought I'd agree with a Geordie lol. Well done! interview was spot on sad for Tyson felt he embarrassed himself
Spot on about the ego thing geordie👌👏
I was never one of your fans true geordie but fair play to you..respect !
You loved every minute of it knowing it would go viral, your a disgrace, enjoy your dirty money
tyson should make it a charity match
Brilliant m8 👍
True Geordie your just a little pegger! 😂
Fury is a great boxer, but quite the fool. You don't need to justify yourself, they are only questions. He's a walking contradiction.
BLACK DILDOS MMMMMMMM
I honestly just saw that last bit as bants between 2 mates Honestly should see me and my mates and what we call each other.  Calm down bonnie lad . And geordies aren't aholes we're great people , honesty being the thing Which u were.
SPOT ON🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A big issue for journalism in this country is the need for access goes for both sports and politics, if a journalist goes to hard on a big name they can be blacklisted from interviewing that person (disastrous for their career). Why having someone questioning a big name is so jarring for many of these people.
Brian is the GOAT , Fury was pissy from minute 1 and u could tell he was gonna b hard work , keep doing what you do all of us here love the work 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Great exposure for you Brian, I enjyed the interview with fury, it the most any journalist or fighter has put him under pressure in and out of the ring.
well fuckin said
Fury seems stressed of late... He does suffer from mental health , he's a Boxer / fighting man so you have to consider all the media work must get on top of you after a while. I was surprised the Chizora fight popped up tbh. Obviously he was geared up for the biggest fight in British boxing history, but you could tell something was going to stop it happening. Any honest fighter should be wanting to fight Joshua at his best. Not off 2 losses with idiotic deadlines. You can't fool the public that easily it's there to see.
It’s becoming very apparent that chisora, usyk, AJ and Joyce are more “men of the people” than Tyson because they don’t kick off against there fans when a question was asked.
You asked the questions we all wanted "proper journalists" to ask.....but they didn't.  You've certainly no need to apollogise, thank you for not apollogising, you weren't in the wrong. You've shown the sports journalism up for what it is, yes men. Great interview, well done.  And as for the fight, this will be one to catch on YouTube.....we already know the result.
I am a fury fan, ONLY when he’s in the ring, however well said man, keep up the good work❤👍, Rab🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿.
Absolultly nothing to apologies about as far as i care!!
It was a great interview. And you triggered a classic narcissist, and that narc injury, as a psychologist, was very predictable.
You mentioning conor benn probably wound him up as he has had failed ped tests too even though nobody mentions it
Ive been sitting on the fence whether I like TG in the past and dont watch his podcasts..im off the fence now  and hes a fkn legend..keep up the good work man keeping it real.
True Geordie ... Well done m8 ... Fury is conning the public .. he's a wanker fuck him .... Fury Vs chisora  bullshit .....
Tyson used to be a humble guy now he’s just a prick 😂 legacy changes people 🤣
I think maybe he did it on purpose for promo , I dunno might be wrong but I didn’t  know he was fighting that dude until I saw your podcast lol
He was being a dick to you long before you even mentioned chisora
I rather see true geordie vs fury any day of the week!   I think you conducted and handled yourself well true Georgie against a vest hostile Tyson fury. I don’t know if he was playing or actually being an asshole, shame really because I really respect the man and I didn’t expect this.
I don't think I've ever agreed so much on a YouTube video since it began!
You could tell fury wasn't feeling it from the first minute of the interview
I fully back you Brian keep doing what your doing hopefully there’s some upcoming journalists that can be like you
Smashed it
New found respect for geordie after the interview with fury, someone needed the balls to say it to him.
It's a tick over fight nothing more nothing less for the usyk fight but still tyson let the mask slip abit there and I agree I don't think he is mentally right at the min ,it all made for great viewing though
A brilliant follow-up to a brilliant interview. Well done and thanks for some sanity and voice of reason
Absolutely love this guy, and he's fucking right in everything he's said, I'm a big Tyson Fury fan, love the guy for what he's done in boxing and with his mental demons overcoming it and becoming world champion and I will say undisputed when he beats usyk , but for a PPV against Derek Chisora is a piss take, that should be on fucking ITV or BBC or maybe the Cartoon Network as it's a joke of a fight, no doubt that it's a pay day probably so he can buy himself a new Ferrari for Xmas. Tyson play the fucking game and fight someone who deserves it not your pal Chisora
It's a dreadful mismatch. I think Fury will carry him like Mayweather carried logan. It's embarrassing... Tyson is a walking contradiction, like his dad. They fall over their tongues continuously.
You need to get Into boxing properly, true british boxing fans need an honest hard working loyal man of the people who can represent us fans and ask the questions we all want answers to, we want something other than IFLTV sucking eddie off
Honestly respect for TG on his interview he asked the questions that many fans felt like needed to be asked with no fear.
You have to understand luke is a looney.
Great video. First proper interview of Fury and he crumbled.
I would actually rather see  u v fury 😆
Lol you v fury   You aren’t interested because as Tyson said people like you have never been in a real fight it your life
You've took the words out of millions of people's mouths, I'm so glad you got that interview with him! It proves all these boxing journalists lick bum, it's pathetic! True geordie = true legend 🔥🔥🔥
Love it Brian 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
To see this negative press on TYSON after TG exposed him in a so many different angles.. I be very worried if I was Frank Warren 😂😂🤦‍♂️
Lol true Geordie is a gronk. Tyson give it to him and it was great
I love this
The people that said he wasn’t qualified to interview Tyson fury, did they forget he already did a full length podcast with him??
Gareth Davies is a cunt ,ignore all those haters Geordie ,interview was on the  money
Your bang on there it took u 10 mins to get to see the real Tyson , they had 10 years and not able to get it , ifltv , seconds out , I,d boxing , talk sport , and the old bastard mr Davies , keep it raw not sure
Said what 90% of us were thinking. You have pundits like Simon Jordan who suck Fury off every week on TalkSport
Yousimply  had the balls to state what we are all thinking & thank fuck to you for that!!! Not that you had to explain yourself but you explained things perfectly right here.. Kudos big man 👏👌
Top fella proper questions no holding back
You were just asking the right questions and actually constantly paid him compliments but he made himself look like a spoilt child. The BS he spouted was so obvious no-one could miss it. He basically showed his real self- a highly unpleasant individual.
Legend
Ive been a fury fan since the ch5 days but ive really turned on him in last few years. Full of contradictions, and dodging fights
Good man TG, nailed it again.  Edit: ...You baldy by choice tosser 😂
TYSON SMOKED YOU FAM
Fury will go back on drink and drugs ,sure he was coked up a few weeks ago and it was on YouTube
Yv spoke for a hell of a lot of folk there pal,,, fellow geordie (Jesmond) plus it was funny as f+:'k 🤣.. Just subscribed...
Great video.  Why has it taken me until now to find you? .  Keep up the good work 👏
100% this is how journalists should be conducting interviews !  Bravo Jordie on keeping it real and not rising to his pathetic attitude throughout the exchange. i wonder how it would have went down if he were across from the table as A) his mask slipped from the very fist take and B) I personally believe his YES men would have pulled plug WAYYY before you got into the nitty gritty and asked the obvious questions we as fans need to have answers for ... he's following the Notorious route .... allowing money fame and deluded tought's of granger take away from what we all loved his "Everyman" Image   more porps to you Brian well done matt - South Wales
I am not even a true jordie fan and I use to be a fyson fury fan    True jordie is speaking real truth and basically asked fury good real questions   Tyson fury is a fake ass bullshit bully
Big W for true Geordie tbf
Chisora and Fury will be in the ring tickling each other ,I'll watch it on the dodgy box
Saw the end of it but didn't see if he called you a dosser or not? You have made it if he did lol
Interview was perfectly fine , well handled with proper questions  Post 2020 is the limp dick world we are living in I might put 💯 quid on a chisora win just in case it’s rigged for a rematch money scoop 😂
This is brilliant
Tyson will go on Talksport and have his belly rubbed now
Never respected you more Brian. You said it how it is
Well said true geordie I respect u for having thee balls to ask hm them questions tyson fury is just a petulant child who thinks he's walking on gold he's nt thee goat and he's nt a god at all I have lost respect for tyson fury after that interview and gained more respect for the true geordie, uve gt it spot on true geordie
Ngl think he hit the nail on the head with pretty much every point then fair play
Brian blue peter badge for m8
And look at how aj went when he lost his last fight he was going mad at people and even went to fight with one guy
Yes Brian. Nailed it.
Fury has the same ‘doctor’ as Conor Benn 🤷🏻‍♂️💉
Word.
Brian, there's one thing you're overlooking with the Dec 3rd deadline and that is Usyk wants to fight him Feb/March: fighting later doesn't make sense in that respect. December 3rd is arguably too late.   Is there also a element that he was bantering with the bald comments? He does it a lot to fellow baldies: baldy
Ah bro you were putting the man down ye Tyson bet him 2times but you never know all it takes is one good hand to put a man down for 10secs
TG + money = massive wanker
I know you say you wouldn't fight Tyson but there must be a price tag you'd do it for with the right time and rounds
Well done
Well said mate you legend ive now become a fan you done a brilliant job 👏
I don’t even really like this fella but everything he’s saying here is facts  Tyson just didn’t like hearing it
Brian you were absolutely in the right in this argument with fury… but please, no cancer jokes.
you did super well in that interview
Reacting to your ‘first and definitely last’ interview with Tyson. Hahahah. Cracking interview, handled so well.
Tyson knows you’re right. Huge respect for saying it how it is
Love it brother, forget the stupid comments
Great job Brian! Would love you to go on Talksport or interview with Simon Jordan and explain how inept they are.
I think Fury probably felt betrayed by the way this guy went at him. Its boxing and half the time most of the matchups are rigged. You cannot point fingers at the athlete when there are so much BS politics involved especially with AJ and Useyk avoiding this fight for sure. Who should Fury fight then? No one wants to lol he's a fighter who needs to fight for living. Basically TG just came across as a hater. Dont like the fight dont watch it. I for sure don't care about Fury fighting Chisora but that doesn't mean im gonna hate when another man shows up to work  best of luck to both men. This bald dude needs to move to those 'intellectuals' and stop farming clicks from Fury
The “good man” line was obviously sarcasm I do that a lot. E.g your a top bloke aren’t ya ‘ ya fuckin cunt etc…
Best interview I've seen with him tbh. Fearless, Brian. Well done.
This guy has shown zero respect to Tyson, trying to act like he's some kind of hero for it.
Fury was 100% right
Someone with such intellect as you say shouldn't be talking about cancer like that its shameful. Great interview with Tyson by the way
My estimation of you has just gone up.Well said mate.
I love both you guys but you could tell Tyson was jittery before it started when he mentioned he only had 40 minutes and he had to go training. Fair enough but it was how he said it. You could tell how he was gonna be
The question to True Gordie that everyone wants answering...   Are you going to do a 'Tyson' and do a trilogy on this content?  Maybe put your next video behind a pay wall 🤷 easy money.
Love the winding up and calling out the bs. Keep it up 😆
interview was boring to listen to and painful to watch, all about you not Tyson.
It was sensational to see how he reacted when asked a question not protected by the media. Exposed himself silly. Big set of bollocks on you and I loved it😂
Very clear issue…. True geordie has zero media training, the end
Hi I’m a big boxing fan and Tyson fan as a boxer  What you did with the interview was fantastic my friend well done about time someone wasn’t pussyfooting around a diva  You’ve got another subscriber now Keep up the great work 👍
I think he was off right from the start of the interview as he knew you was going to call him out over the quality of the fight. Ok, the AJ fight aint happening. Joe Joyce is the next inline, a genuine threat to any current Heavyweight. Thats the fight "WE" the fans would like to see, not a payday for the lads.
True Geordie back in his prime
Brian you did a bloody amazing interview with Tyson, you could see he was on in a shitty from the word go. Take care wor kid
Right on the button..
Well said
Ali had 2 trilogies I'm soo surprised fury didn't no that
You handled that interview brilliantly TG. Massive respect
If you’re saying Derek vs fury is a non competitive fight then uysk vs fury is a non competitive fight, fury beats Derek 99% but there’s always a punchers chance I understand where Brian’s coming from but I think Derek is as an competitive fight as usyk is
No Tyson is such a nice guy. He gave his entire purse to the homele….  Oh wait
Why didn’t you speak up when you interviewed him, you big softy
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Well after this how can you not be a lifetime fan
You really should’ve brought up how he retired after beating Whyte, came back to ‘become Undisputed champion’ to then fight Chisora. If he really wanted to be Undisputed Champion, he wouldn’t fight someone whose 0-2 against him, even as a warm-up fight. All it shows is he took a fight he knows he will win when there are some actual fights people would want to see and would actually pose a challenge e.g. Andy Ruiz. Ruiz is the only other person to beat Joshua outside Usyk and to hold a title. He didn’t get the rematch he actually deserved against Joshua, at 1-1, even spreading the rumour Joshua took the safe method to win cause he was scared of Ruiz. That fight would bring numbers in because Ruiz brings something that Fury hasn’t really faced. If Fury took that fight, no-one would complain as it’s an interesting and exciting fight and that would be one of the best fights that has happened during this era of boxing.
I felt he was annoyed at you right from the start. Probably for something you said about him in the past, something like, I dunno, why is he fighting chisora?!
He doesn’t care about legacy but he is happy to remind us who is the lineal champ
Excellent points from True Geordie!
Journalist or not. You're a fight fan and gave a mouthpiece to all us other fans of combat sports.  Not about legacy, I want a 2nd trilogy Fury is so full of contradictions. Most probably the AJ fight fell through because Fury was a pain in the arse to deal with. Well done TG anorher great video!!!
You did a great job mate, shouldn’t have to apologise for saying it how it is…
You asked questions anyone of us would have asked talk about milking it
Agree with absolutely 100% of what you said! 👏
You conducted yourself perfectly fine in the interview. Tyson just couldn't handle hearing the questions he knew everybody wanted answering
You speak for all of us !!!
He might to be able to beat everyone else but he can't beat himself. He knows deep down the fans are right
Great content and totally agree…jeez you do look like fury now you mention it 😮
its ok TG you just got to meet the real luke fury, its good to see that peoples eyes are finally opening to that con artist fighting low ranked fighter while trying to con money out of fans
I think the fly was pissing him off more than you was
TG, you owned Fury by daring to be being truthful with a bully who is possibly bipolar and runs with the hounds and the hares. You may have done him a favour and make him ponder his contradictive behaviour and seek help. You don’t need to justify anything, you are a breath of fresh air Brian. Steam onwards n upwards that man. Respect.
Well said fury is a prick
Enjoyed the interview and recap. Your cancer references weren’t placed well though. I’m not sure how anyone thinks taking the piss out of something millions of people have had their life’s ruined by will ever land well.
Literally this whole interview is basically a next level mic 🎤 drop... awesome let's sit back and watch ⌚️
pick up a phone? tyson could pick up a skyscraper compared  to you
All this bollocks about Fury being the goat and he’s so good is bullshit. The man’s overrated as fuck. Apart from Wilder , who himself has beat absolutely no one world class, and klitchko, who has Tyson Fury actually beat that says he’s this amazing best in the world heavyweight? Yeh he’s good but he ain’t as good as people make out or give him credit for, look At his record it sucks!!!! All he’s ever done is fight bums, he uses the exact same play book as wilder!
You’re so insecure 😂😂
True Interviewer. 🎙🙌🏻  Ps. Hope this videos quick though… gotta go gym!
Guys.. Tyson Fury has mental problems. That's all what here can be said.
Get Tommy 🇬🇧 on you big dosser
You the GOAT mate! Keep the great work you doing!
Fury to used to being interviewed by the likes of the Piers Morgans of this world, tv personalities that implant tongue firmly up his jacksie. Couldn't handle a few home truths.
Your interview was superb but I do reckon he was having a bad day. Happens to the best of us. He was fuming from the jump you can tell
Top lad for not backing down and been honest !!
exhibition fight,acted out in the ring between these two..
Great video 100%on the money but ffs don't joke about cancer
Brian flippin bang on video. Well said...
Tyson is a big dosser and timeswaster
The boxing media have criticised you because you have made them look bad, so they are doubling down. You have exposed them, they care more about their credentials and access then telling the truth.
Can't wait to see Geordie reacting to his reaction video of his tyson fury interview
Why not just straight call out Gareth A Davies and Umar directly for the pussies they are! 🤣👌🏻
Tyson Fury is the best Heavyweight in the world but not the most dangerous. If Chisora needs to pack it in then it makes sense that he gets a huge payday to send him on his way.
Ahahah I fucking love Brian
Brian "You  cheeky bastard" 🤣🤣😂
Amen
We know Tyson has health issues. A cheap shot to be making money on the back of his name at the minute.
Awesome reaction mental gymnastics had me 😂 Ignore the haters they are only playing their role as bum kissers. Not everyone is on the same level in life but one thing that is difficult to have is intergrity unfortunately and that’s what you showed in that interview love and light people it’s not that deep ✌️
You are defo a journalist of sport Mate first of all and you are up there with rogan.  Best interview of the year mate
Nice week at the office. Well played
Thats why we love you geordie you are unapologetically yourself and say it how it is even when others are to scared, love your work.
Tyson Fury can fight whoever the ff he wants to. Why should he live his life for you bloodthirsty violence thirsty so called "fans" who wouldn't last 10 seconds with him in the ring. He's expecting Usyk at the end of February or somewhere in March. Why tf must he wait for Joshua for three months? Joshua clearly didn't want it otherwise they would have jumped on it. So no, he couldn't wait for three months for Joshua to sign. Fury wants undisputed and he's focusing on that. Joshua is a three time loser and would have been a quick knockdown. Chisora is a clear off ring rust/stay busy fight to keep him ready for undisputed. His life and f you all. Don't pay for it if you don't want to and get your own life.
Well said Brian, don't need to go into details of what happened, you brought him tyson fury to the level where he belongs, keep doing what you're doing mate, that's why we listen to you.
Hey man! i have new found respect for you so here's my forty indian rupees for you TG.
Oioi wor kid ya saying exactly same as me like I honestly think Fury is Fighting against a lesser opponent again nobody really wants to see this fight maybe casuals
Agreed. Rather see Fury vs True geordie + lawrence Mckenna on the same night than Derek Chisora.
This bloke is a proper bell end
Brilliant upload.  The perfect response, youre a good lad, keep your humour, itll prolong a happy life.
Its funny because you would not say any of this too his face. Thats his problem with you. And you talk about the yes men around him. Same could be said to you. Your a hypocrite
I agree with all of this. I grew up in the same town as Virgil Hill. When he showed up he'd always answer our questions. Tyson threw a bitch fit. So Brian won this.
Umar IFL Umar and Gareth the Arsehole Davies have been ripped a new one 😂😂😂   Well done TG 👏🏽
Well said
You are good at your job, try ignore them doubts
funny thing is, it would only take Goerdie 3months jujitsu training to whoop the Gypsy King
Very very well said. Tyson contradics himself so much. His excuse to not answer certain questions is to say it's non of my business what they do as he knows he'll be dragged into previous quotes he's said tripping him up. As for ifl etc saying you're style of interview was wrong, who are they to say that when all they do is nosh fighters off. Gareth Davies is the worst for noshimg tyson in an interview.  It's cringy to watch. You've come onto the scene quickly and showed then up and they don't like it. Keep up the good work.
Nailed it. You did precisely what was needed at the right time. Good on ya, Geordie.
Gareth A Davies blame shifting to your interview style is a prime example of how awful the boxing journalism is currently
This fight won’t sell lol fury is a baby an absolute baby I love his boxing been a fan of his since 2013 but he’s a crying baby
Kind of let yourself down doing this, it seems your ego is now taking control, how dare Tyson fury have a go at me...."ive now thought of what i should of said so here it is, 2nd time lucky eh...... lol
Yeah good point is he’s always talking about stuff that’s got nothing to do with him plus his dad even commented on benn saying he should be fucking banned
TG is correct - we all want Fury to fight AJ and Usyk. He has to; otherwise...
I really wish fury smokes him in real life but we all know he would run like a scared puss
Bloody hilarious! Keep doing what you're doing Brian and I hope other content creators follow suit.
Fury is full of rubbish.. he’s lost respect from so many boxing fans!
I sense Gareth A Davies watching this whilst overly puffing on his vape and running his fingers through his greasy hair.
7:33 he obviously watch ksi before he did this
You bamboozled him so hard he did nothing but contradict and embarrass himself. Ffs you bald headed baldy 🤓
I haven't seen it yet. Feel like Tysons might be on a come down so cbf. Thing is tho for every noob including Georgie, USE ALL have youtube ulll find video from 8 years or whatever back. Tysons has ALWAYS SAID if he FIGHTS HIM its his last fight... he's said this since the first and 2nd chaz fight lol
Hey there Gordy, Vinnie from Boston Mass. I've been in love with Boxing my entire life!.. Not just a fan but sparred many talented fighters from the Boston area...I know bullshit when I see it when it comes to this sport.. All I have to say is the " True" in true Gordy spoke for itself in your interview with Fury!... Don't change a thing my brother.. fantastic honest interview!!
Dil do
You don’t have to explain anything pal 👍🏼
Dil.. in the a%$ for True Geordie
One day Tysons gona retire and thought about how of a tosser he once was
Could it really be called easy, if hes job is to be punched in the face by professional boxers?
do more mma content
Yup Tyson behaved like a bellend. And I say that as a fan.
Class lol
people don’t understand geordie is saying what 80% of people are thinking and the other 20% are tyson fury fanboys that just want to see him fight and see him in the limelight
Mr. Geordie, you did a good interview with Fury, ignore the criticism from anyone. I watch that interview with Fury and from the onset I can tell Fury never liked you, even the way he was ignoring some questions tells me he don't like you. Please continue your good Job.
He probably got annoyed because he found out you are a bit of a weirdo deviant
Bro u asked the right questions but your behind a screen talking big then trying to call fighters dumb you want to be carefull its not tyson u wanna be worried about its shane his brother mate big mouth you have
‘Genuinely more people would want to see Tyson fight me’  this is the problem that YouTube boxing brings. MC /commentators think they can fight with world champion boxers lol. Not really pointed out geordie with that because it’s obviously just a piss take but that attitude is leaking out of these people.
Perfectly said 👏
Ok that intro was good
Geordie is the best you dont need to explain yourself :)
Brian why do you shave your head when you can easily grow a full head of hair?  Why would you wanna be bald?
Brave man TG. Subscribed.
Gwed TG
👏 You respectfully asked relevant questions, the irony of some of the responses from the “boxing experts” is they’re still blowing smoke up his arse
You disrespected Fury and his trilogy opponent during the interview, repeated criticisms caused the reaction, and rightfully so.  You need look no further than your intent to rile Fury up, you got what you had coming.
It's seems like if you don't agree with fury your disrespecting him,
I'm a big Tyson fan but his attitude stinks just lately, there was no need to talk to you like that,
Im of the opinion that your interview video was good, you asked him difficult questions and stood your ground. But honestly, now you overextended yourself, you're making a  mess out of the situation, I see no reason for you to be making this video creating hard feelings between you and fury. Tyson fury reacted like he reacted because that is his personality, and because of this personality that he is so much loved. I really don't think that he had anything personal with you, he was just put in a difficult interview and reacted with his swearing, but you shouldn't have taken his words so seriously.
Two narcissists meet head to head can't stand either both overrated.
well said mate. Im glad you cleared it up that youre a baldy by choice. Great response all round!!
Ronnie Fucking Pickering!!!!
this is fantastic
I agree with everything you said except that you said that Jordan Peterson is an intellectual 😆
your just a little pritty boy and i love it lol
I gained a ton of respect for how you did your job in a professional way and didn’t back down to Tyson. It’s a bit hard to hear Tyson act like suck a prick because he’s been my favorite fighter and someone I look up to. The way he acted in your interview really put me off. Regardless, I’m proud of you for doing your job and asking the hard questions in a respectful way. Shows you’ve got balls
So like I back Geordie here and I'm aware of how low he's been through social media and the comments he has received but to talk about not being great at receiving criticism and not having comments on Twitter where people can add their own criticism is a little hypocritical. Apart from that, I think it's a perfect response and has nailed Tyson to a tee. Expecting some backlash from this but think we need to be able to see both sides in a sticky situation like this.
Usyk is the main Heavyweight right now. For the people and for the sport.
Go on lad!!!! You should fucking proud of what you’ve achieved!!!
Reality of why that interview took such a turn...  Brian spoke about the Fury fight being too easy of a fight for Fury BEFORE the Fury interview, obviously Fury heard what he said and came into the interview with a head on him. And Brian was absolutely right, I'm a big Fury fan but even I won't spend my money on watching this fight and it's a fucking disgrace that it's on Box Office.
If you think Joshua is a test for fury keep on slagging mate and great job in down grading mental health,  say it to his face
Mad respect for you, you did what no one else has the balls to do.
You did good because fury said only has 40 minutes spare at beginning. And you cut interview about 20 mins lol. You got ur gold and locked him off ahahaha
Very rarely i agree with you brian. But your spot on with this one 🤙🏻🤣
I think ud have tyson. Looks like hes on beer and sniff 😃
*Tyson was correct to call you out. I lost all respect for you.* You're a pathetic lying hypocrite. You would never say any of this to Tyson's face. You keep acting tough yet you can barely hold your own in a spar against 160lbs Gib. *Go beg girls to dominate you.*
Well done TG
Tyson was having withdrawal symptoms too much bag recently lol
He is a gypo at end of day so being able to articulate himself isnt his forty
Tyson was in a rubbish mood from the off. Could tell he was defensive before a question was even asked. After Brian left it with respect for both fighters at the end Tyson should have just left it alone and gone on his way. He’s the WHC so can do what he wants but unnecessary to have a pop imo.
Well in Brian, you're brains actually out weighed Tyson! You where spot on wor kid excellent content, btw who would really pay ppv to see Del and Tyson at it again. Tyson cannot travel to USA same as Tommy, ya nar why Brian. Keep up with the quality content!  Cheers pal 🇬🇧👍
I used to like Tyson but now I can’t stand to hear him talk, would much rather listen to his dad
TG vs Fury hell in a cell match early 2023???
As a massive fan of Tyson and as someone who's been nothing but inspired by him and motivated with all he's done for mental health, I can confidently say your interview with him was bang on, it was hard to watch, but everything you said is everything we've been thinking. All I have to say is I hope once the mist of all of this clears for him he will re emerge as his true self, which I strongly believe is not who he has been this last year or so. I just try to remind myself this is a man with severe bipolar and mental health who has so much pressure and bullshit around him that he can no longer see the wood through the trees. I hope he can return to his happy, on form self and if he can give us some top tier fights along the way all the better  Eitherway massive fan of you Brian and congrats on 2mill, felt like you were stuck at 1.99 for an eternity
Umar & G.Davis getting shredded xD   Let's see them ask these questions. Wait what? Yeh not going to happen.
He’s just like his father
you had 40 minutes with him and talked about KSI no wonder he got pissed off with you
Brian, you handled everything superbly and you're a fantastic podcaster who owns the true values of the general public and isn't afraid to share them with stars. However in this case, people need to remember that Tyson Fury is in fight camp which is (from many years of being a fan of combat sports), a gruelling time. Tyson struggles with his mental health, probably somewhat physically beat up and may have done his 10th interview that same day.  I'm not defending Tyson's words against you but we all fall at times and it may not have been a true reflection of Tyson himself.  Hopefully people won't take one interview where Tyson was pissed/verbally abusive and hold it against him.  I don't necessarily think a reaction video to your interview was required as stated above, you were brilliant and have the backing of the majority of people who watched it and you don't ever need to justify your actions when you're a grown man.  You got views, he was in a bad mood, end of story in my opinion.
mate u genuinely did not need to explain urslef, fuck the idiots hating
Brian is the only reason i watch these fights. I am not a fight fan. Call me plastic whatever.
5:09 that face you make when you’re about to bust
🔥🔥🔥🔥 with you bud
Your ego is getting way too big !!
True Georgie can’t take criticism 😂😂😂 what a muppet he looks in this video
A worthy opponent. CHALLENGE!!! ✊👍
TG is a better boxing journalist than all them shills and yes men and they KNOW IT, that’s why they’re trying to discredit him but it’s obvious what they’re doing and makes them look even more like a Tyson brown nose!
Unless Chisora French kisses Tyson or his Dad while they are arguing or does something ridiculous like that, I'm not watching the fight.
All The Question We Wanted Asking Got Asked, Obviously Some Of Us Haven't Got The Platform Or Contacts To Ask Fury Ourselves So We Do It It Through People Like Yourself. I Don't Think You Said Anything Out Of Line.. As You Say Straight Off The Bat He's Not Interested In Doing The Interview In The Slightest By Saying Something Like "Right I've Gotta Be Going By This Time So We Haven't Got Long".. Also As You Say I Literally Think He's Just On The Defence Cause He Knows As Much As Anyone That Nobody Should Be Paying For This Fight Its A Full Gone Conclusion.. Fury Might Let It Go To Points Now Just To Prove Its Not An Easy Fight But Non The Less... Its A Pointless Fight.
You did the podcast equivalent of knocking him out in the 2nd round🤪😉😂😂  In all seriousness Brian, I think you did a great job of the interview, fair play.👌👌
It was GARETH THE ARSEHOLE DAVIES
Who knew True Geordie would be the first man to hand Fury his first loss lol
Keep up the good work, that’s all really F the rest
Russell Brand is not a heavyweight intellectual, Brian. He doesn't have any credentials in fact. Quantity isn't Quality. You exposed yourself there brov. Otherwise good podcast.
This was the only fight available ! He wanted Anthony Joshua! Everyone else either turned it down, or wouldn’t make a fight as big as Chisora.
I don't always agree with what you say, but you did nothing wrong in that interview. If anything you asked the questions us fans wish we had the chance to ask so don't need to explain and justify yourself to the fools who don't understand. I'm glad you also brought up all the contradictions cause I thought I was the only one who noticed them lol much respect Brian 💪
Really enjoy watching every upload you do on this and xtra, please keep it up man 🙏🏻
Big up true Geordie you say nothing but the truth you're doing amazing
I dont get why eveyones bigging Brian up, this joke of an interviews only objective was to prod Tyson to get a reaction. Nothing brave about it, self serving tabloid journalism at its worst
Ledge!
Calidad y humildad
You did well and asked him correct difficult questions that he could not or was unable to give an honest answers to! Fury actual admitted that  it’s a pay day…..
Should have just done an interview with AJ now
Anyone who is angry here with Brian's analysis of what he is talking about should search on youtube for his first video!. Tells it how it is!! Well done for being TRUE!..
This is so refreshing seeing someone calling out Fury on all his bullshit 👏👏👏
Love Fury but glad you got him told. Nd i certainly wont be buying the PPV 😂
100% agree!
Honestly props for asking the big question tho
All I hear is FACTS bro
I didn't see you interview but I think you're right fury could have found a better fight but wer ar thay and didn't he try to get a good fight on but no one will take the big doser on..thay all make excuses so del boy steps up good man.
Gareth A. Davies did a pretty great summing up of your interview - if you wanted to know how to improve your interview technique, I think it’s worth a watch
Bro this man has army’s following maybe don’t go out for a while and stop slatting him argee the fight pointless but. Don’t piss him off bloody hell
Too much talking , not enough fighting  ffs
Agree Geordie, you’re better than him at running your mouth
He was a rude ignorant pig. Boycott this rubbish fight. Boycott this rubbish fight. Finally. Boycott this rubbish fight.
I was just happy to see people in the comments of these other videos highlighting the great work you did in that interview. Keep asking the questions that people don't want to ask Brian!
The man who said he retired. Then comes back to milk his fans.
5:45  ''Who the hell are you to tell me what I need to be doing?'' Coming from a podcaster who is telling the world champ, one of the best ever, what he needs to be doing and not doing.   Love you Geordie but seriously...I think this whole thing is a battle of Egos!  Tyson said as much in his interview its to give a payday to somebody he sees deserves it.  It's not such a dishonorable thing. But hey, you make payday now too!    Weird how life goes when you follow the paper instead of your passions.
It’s not mental gymnastics his brain has just been re-wired by Wilders right hand.
Only people saying you was trying to make him mad are bitter interviewers who just say yes to everything he says & make it the same interview every time!
I became a subscriber of this channels all because of that tyson furry interview that shows furry’s real side. Lmfao
Brilliant Brian mate, top man👏🏻
You’re the man Geordie
U did nothing wrong , Tyson is being a baby
You did good in your interviewing True Geordie.  I'm worried for Derek Chisora.  He's been punched in the head so many times.  He has a lot of mileage on his clock.  His thinking and reaction times in interviews are slow.  Unless he's always been like that ?  If I was Derek's trainer, I would have advised him to get a medical clearance and/or a head scan before fighting Tyson Fury, because the power Tyson has, and that he showed in Wilder/Fury 2+3 ........... it's a worry.
Good on you man, massive W.
What a brilliant vid! 100000000% agree with you mate
Love your vids but you are going to be so caught out if Chisora spawns a KO. Unlikely yes but could happen and it would be amazing.
Legend ! Fury is a prick
Agree 99%. Jordan Peterson an intellectual heavyweight?? Lmao FOH
I agree with what TG says but the "hard earned money PPV" argument makes no sense and saying "no one wants to see" equally makes no sense because you don't have to watch it and therefore u don't have to pay and if no one wants to see it. And if no one wants to see it then why comment about the "hard earned money" if no one's watching anyway? And of course it also makes no sense because they've made shitloads of ticket sales.
@fury Charlie says _______/
Spot on again, I’ve lost all respect for fury now and shows the whole mental health ambassador stuff was all fake. The mask has slipped again on the bipolar gypsy king. Bottled AJ even tho would smash him and won’t fight usyk definitely disappointed.
I did like the interview and you could clearly see Tyson wasn’t in the right state of mind from the get go like saying ‘I’ll need to be gone in 45 mins’.. especially asking the questions fans actually want answers to Tyson was being fairly inconsiderate
Great vid mate and well said.
True G
Brian's a legend for not backing down. Best interviewer and podcaster, right next to Joe Rogan!👏🏻🙏🏻
WELL SAID
TG hasn't done anything wrong. He's been fearless and truthful. But nether has Fury, he's a fighter and he's felt disrespected by TG and that's just the way it is. No one owes anyone an apology.
Anything can happen, look at when Fury’s eye split ? One punch in this division can shake up the world!
Good job geordie!!
You did great I gotta admit but man I wish you carry the same energy when you interview one of the Paul brothers or KSI because when you do, you are exactly like he journalists you are laughing at here! You are such a kiss ass towards them tbh
Respect!!. 💪🏻
Fury seemed to have his nose out of joint with Brian from the very beginning of the interview
You did great in the interview geordie. But I reckon  just bow out now, go out on top. I don't mean quit lol I just mean leave this topic alone for a few weeks
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💯💯💯
Don’t beat yourself up Brian…some of us miss the old days with your Newcastle rants on The Football Hangover…you should go back to that…oh wait y’all slapping teams left and right..never mind
Time for you my friend get back to mma. Boxing isn't what it use to be.
Legend dosnt give a fuck
If you weren’t so busy I’d suggest getting yourself at boxing events with your camera and start interviewing people in boxing, I’ve been watching boxing content for nearly 10 years on YouTube and no one has asked questions like that to Tyson in the YouTube world (IFL, boxing social, behind the gloves, seconds out etc) I can only respect the fact you’re trying to ask proper questions that deserve an honest answer. Should have asked him about kinahan that would have really annoyed him 😂
Dead on mate
cant lie. Geordie v Fury would be great haha
Starts saying furys ego too big cant take criticism, ends by saying I'm the best interviewer ever dont criticise me lol
I’ve always liked true geordies content and humour, but he’s a f***ing girl.
I’m on your side. It’s ridiculous Fury is fighting Chisora again and not Usyk or AJ
Whahaha fucking love you geordie. Making fun of the fucking heavyweight champion like this. I’ve been boxing for 2 months and I would still back you up against this cunt. Love you Brian, you’re my absolute favorite content creator!!! One of my My goals as a musician is trying to earn a podcast with you one day. Love you you fucker❤️❤️
Look Tyson v Del Boy is just Tyson keeping busy till usyk is ready as he wasn’t or couldn’t do December Tyson is probably pissed off at the fight to mate it gutting that he couldn’t get aj or usyk in the ring in December as you said he needs to keep busy for is mental health in my eyes he a legend don’t judge him on that interview keep up the good work
He definitely let his mask slip - well done on your reaction :)
The drug reference with Connor was because of his own issues, he wasn’t angry about that just maybe a bit ashamed. He can’t excuse this fight but might have to promote it when it isn’t the best fight out there. Any fighter that gets in the ring deserves respect as the consciences that occur could be the end but the levels are so different that it is horrible that fury can get in the ring and possibly hurt Chisora to just have a fight/stay active.
You could tell Tyson had the hump from word go I thought Brian had said something previous to piss him off but no. I think when Tyson keeps contradicting himself its maybe his bipolar disorder. Keep up the good work bro.
🐐
I hope you two clear the air
People forget that after the Parker rematch most of the boxing fans were saying he should Chisora quit. I hope he finally retires after this fight before he gets hurt.
First interview was great, loved it. But you should have left it at that, would have left a better mark.
Is that t-shirt sprayed on 😂
Geordie is right here, I don't know anything about boixing mind, but Geordie is right
True georidie is a wrongen
Perfect Response.
I honestly thought the whole thing was a bit. That's unbelievable. NOw I know, I think TG did extremely well. Stayed in the pocket and on point, respectful too.
Can’t talk about Jake  and Anderson Silva fight
Brian you’re a legend
What a nice head kick though
Well said! Journalism is mostly dead.
THIS is the True Geordie I fell in love with years ago! Obviously respect the grind over the years. But this unfiltered TRUTH is what brought us to you man, seriously.
Huge respect to you Geordie
Thing is bro you basically wouldn't let it go, you gave him a bit of sht about Chisora, he answered it, then you rephrased it and gave it to him again, he answered it again, then you rephrased it and did it again, so it's hardly surprising he eventually just told you where to go
Get off Tysons Deek Geordie... Kissing his ass enough are you? How much did he pay you for this apology video? I thought you were "True" Geordie... I guess you really are "Good Geordie" PS..... Yes I am totally joking and playing the other end which is obviously not the case. Props for keeping it real!
Not really a TG fan, but fair play, fair play 👏🏻👏🏻
tyson is a mong an tommy was too scared to fight jake paul - change my mind?
Bro.. All water under the bridge. Tyson fury has maybe half a decade more of his career left. After that nobody would even care to have an interview with a retired boxer. You, meanwhile have 20 to 30 yrs of you're career left. You will still be here, still being awesome even after furys retired. Keep it going man.!
Fury lost the plot in your interview. His answers were all over the place and his thinking was erratic.
I can smell 3M subs coming True Geordies' way........
Someone keep an eye on Eddie Hearn, not being part of that list of intellectuals is gonna wreck him.
The big man speaking straight facts here
I’m a Tyson fan but I couldn’t give to shiny shites about this fight i have bigger fights with the Mrs 😂
Hi Brian, when are you interviewing Chisora to ask him whether he is on Fury's level to fight him? Maybe meet him face to face at his home for the interview?
mate your a belter podcaster, tyson is a complete helmet and you stuck it on him. Absolutely hats off you buddy!
I saw the interview and thought fury was in a mood from the begin and not his usual self. The way you were trying to deal with him clearly such respect as you can see you admire him, was done really well.   But this video is class 🤣 within the first 10 seconds making me crease. Fair play Brian, giving your opinion no matter what, even if it’s to someone you respect and admire.
Your reaction to the aftermath is unnecessary. Your questions were all BOXING related and you weren’t trying to wind him up. No need to defend the interview.
Yes
You r a real g, respect 🙏
All of this is Fury’s own fault. He calls out AJ and offers a reasonable 40% purse. This gets everyone very excited and builds expectations. Then he throws out stupid and unrealistic deadlines that was likely a deliberate attempt to collapse the negotiations. However you cut it there is something inauthentic about his behaviour and constant contradictions.
Massive respect for asking the tough questions every fan wants answered, not backing down or losing your arse when he flipped and also for this follow up video. What you did was true journalism and other so called journalists should be thanking you and showing respect. You're a credit to the industry. Keep up the good work man! 👌💯🥊
Damn right good points made
I the first wilder fight...looking at the difference in weight.... Fury tot dropped by a bantam weight....
Bit rich for Geordie to talk about ego. Ego is why you’re clapping back kid 😂 your ego can’t help but run your mouth.
Couldn’t agree more with you. As a fan of Tyson and a fan of yourself, everything you said was spot on and there’s been multiple times where Tyson has shed his kin.   Enjoy the pay day though😂
Dared to ask the Heavyweight Champion of the world questions no journo dared to. Kudos to you 👏🏽
Whether you like Geordie or not, it's hard to disagree with anything he says in this video 🤷‍♂️
Glad he pushed these questions on to Fury   But that aside Im not fussed on his style much. No offence, just comes across very desperate for likes etc. swears too much and accent is annoying 😆  Again tho, thank GOD someone asked Fury these questions. Warren next
Respect to Brian for not backing down. Asks the questions we all want to know the answer too👊
Big up TG
I’m a Fury fan and I normally defend him to the cows come home but not this time, he was not prepared for simple questions that other journalists haven’t got the balls to ask. I’m with TG on this one.
wow you are brave lad you are getting a slap if you see tyson again .
Tasteless cancer joke.
Keep doing what you’re Brain lad and fuck the lot of them. 🖤🤍  Tyson - Chisora 3 History making!it’s just laughable man and if people are paying for this fight well you’ve certainly been “Del Boyd”
As respectful as i can be... Fury only was able to get up against wilder... Because he weighs 280pounds on fight night... Lol he got dropped twice by anfighter weighing 208pounds( first wilder fight)
“ sensational “
Well said 👌
It’s irrelevant that Chisora and Fury are different fighters now. The fact remains that Fury can and will just jab his way to a points victory with very little risk.
His probably having a bad day and he gains nothing from doing these interviews outside of contract so he is doing this geeza the favour I think he got wound up because this Geeza is gaining fro having him on his podcast and in turn his trying to directly dent his and chisoras profit from the fight sales
It would be hilarious if Chisora then beat Fury.
Milking this now like 😂
Lmao ur not hard say this 2 his face
Spot on and very true True Geordie! Pun intended.
Good job...
Fury and Hearn ducked the Fury AJ fight. AJ and Queensberry were bang up for it. Chisora is a poor choice of an opponent for fury but that could have been largely forgiven had he not screwed up the the AJ negotiations.
Well said TG
In all fairness nobody has to buy the pay per view so I don’t get the charging the British public thing
You come across as triggered because ppl are triggered.  Maybe should have kept quiet and let the ppl talk.
You don’t represent anyone if you don’t like the price don’t buy the fight - shocking what you did to fury
Yes Brian!! These idiots don’t have a clue 😂 brilliant interview someone needed to put it on him..
Yes True Geordie!! Flawless execution 👌
to be honest i would want to see true geordie vs tyson fury in any sport lol
THIS......perfect
I have so much respect for this man. We’ll done geordie. You are a man of the people
You only said what we are all thinking , awkward for tyson or not we want the answers to the questions you asked.
Fantastically articulated and knowledgeable yet funny as ever. This video is another example why I watch so much of your content man. Speaking with your head and your heart and that’s something I can only applaud. Well done True Geordie 👏🏾🔥
You know what Brian, i have gone off you a lot over the last few months but i have to say that the interview was good, you had balls and you did say what everyone wanted to hear and as much as i also love Tyson, he was a fucking dick. He has taken the piss out of his loyal fans and he took the piss out of you because you had the balls to say it. I hope Tyson will redeem himself, come off his high horse, and treat you and the rest of us with some respect.
Legend ❤
Was a good interview.  Good work was done that day.
I've seen the video where Tyson says he's trying to get into heaven. Rich people don't get into heaven do they?
This guy deserves whatever tyson does when he sees him and dereck too. Give fighting men especially heavyweight champs the respect they deserve.  Chisora deserves this too btw he kills himself in the ring. Ur pouring negative energy into other mens work from behind a screen not even face 2 face.
Respect!!!
it's not your job to be a bellend you hypocrit
You should have asked Tiresome Fairy the Gypsy Queen about ;  -using PEDs to beat Vlad   and...  - if that is why he didn't want to talk about Conor Benn.  - the charity money he never donated  - his association with Kinahan.   He would have blown a gasket
What a way to reach 2 million😂😂… who will the “victim” for your 10 million 😅
The only issue is it took Tyson acting like that to you, to see his true colours. Eddie Hearn has been telling the public about Furys constant contradictions. Fury is no doubt back on the sniff and wandering down his dangerous path. Things won't end well for him. He's hasn't got the maturity to navigate these things on his own.
Excellent comments, YouTube is entertainment but we also want proper journalism
Bald by choice = oh that's ok then Bald without choice= haha baldy fuck. State of ya
I think he means it when he says he don't give a fuck you no. 👏🤣
Derek is a man of the people and you are just disrespecting him and boxing this isn't utube boxing...I'm not hating but all this is doin is disrespecting Derek and the fight don't forget Fury is in camp so what did you expect
"Why are you on your 3rd autobiography when you only have 1 life" .... I literally spat out the entire family's drinks 😂😂😂
Joking about cancer? Ha ha? 😒
Spot feckin on lad. Everything you said was spot feckin on
Spot on with every point
I think he just needs to apologise publicly and blame it on his pre workout
You sound like my girlfriend 😂
True Geordie.... Respect
Who else out there would tyson fight for that date tho ?
Gareth Davies, Ade, IFL, and all the other turnips have not the balls and intellect to challenge boxers. Well done Geordie. Always thought you were a tit but you've changed my opinion
I agree with a lot you've said but calling people morons for saying you don't have the interview pedigree after you've just said 'You're a genius at that one thing but that doesn't give you the right to treat everyone a certain way because they haven't achieved what you have in that one field '. Pot calling the kettle black?
cringe that he reacts to his own interview. really milking it. no one cares
fury didn't wanna answer the connor benn situation since he himself has failed a PED test before lmao 🤣
About 10 minutes too long this one
I’m not a regular fan of the channel but your interview was outstanding.  Well done .  Tyson was insulting the audience intelligence.
Did he come from nothing, or did he in fact go to a posh school and grow up in a big detached house his dad built in an affluent village off the back of a successful car sales business? Never actually lived on a site.
Another funny vlog. Just tell the haters to give tha heeds a wobble. Your only asking questions ffs.
👍🇺🇲🗽🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👍
Mate in two videos you've outdone what some 'boxing channels' have spent years doing. Unfiltered and real. Bravo my man.
Tbf I thought "oh my god here we go double up on your own content" then he admitted it 20 seconds in so fair play 🤣🤣🤣
Great reaction 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Spot on!!!! You have done your job the way it should be asked him the questions that we all wanted to know the answers too. Fuck Fury and he’s bullshit 😂
Massive props for the interview and your general rise to fame... As you said, you've interviewed some pretty big names! Tyson lost my respect for how he conducted that interview, big child. I used to be a big fan, it's a shame. Hes all about mental health and man of the people one minute then completely disrespecting almost everyone! Saw I recent interview where he came across as proper racist and that made me shudder now this! You were asking legitimate questions, but as he didn't like it he resorted to insults! I won't buy another fury book nor will I buy his fights again, he's a tosser!
Fucck me man. I was around when u did that first nufc rant years ago. I've watched u grow living ur dream b haters will b haters.. Keep goin bonny lad
🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥
One of my favourite fighters but He’d of gotten beaten off lennox Lewis, he’s good in the modern era but come on an old klitschko, he isn’t really among the greats, obviously the best here.
I think any producer in the world would have been telling geordie to reign it in. Massive props for holding his own influence to the standard he’d hold other media outlets to. Geordie you’re the man.
This just gets exponentially better. One of the best if not best interviewers on the internet. Agree with pretty much everything TG says.
Lost so much respect for Tyson, you asked the questions that should’ve been asked, and him saying making fun of you for being bald is just hilarious 😂😂😂
Amazing!! Thank you Brian.
The way you stood up and didn’t bottle it was admirable fair play. People of Tysons level of fame won’t often have people tell them things they don’t want to hear, he didn’t like it but needed to be called out!
Kugan has been at over 10 years. There's a rumour going around that he held an opinion once, I'm not sure when? But I've heard it happened. As for boxing social they've got a kid now 'interviewing' that they wheel out for Eddie Hearn. Half the interview is an analysis of each others outfits with the other half selling the show. They've perfected their format.
Bout Tim some one challenged him .love him as a boxer but he needed to be challenged mentally
This style of videos reminds me of his older stuff where he used to rant about Newcastle and England. Very cool
Spoke nothing but facts
🫡
Class🤣🤣🤣👌
TG was not even remotely rude to Fury. We just got a glimpse of the real Fury, and not the fake image he feeds the public.
Savage response geordie 👏
Brilliant 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
So refreshing to have someone like you in Boxing Brian! Keep doing your thing and asking the tough questions to these huge Ego's!! 🙏🙌
Your a legend mate always keep it real g
IFL Umar give this a watch 😂
Your interview was great but most of this video was cringy
Been a fury fan since before the first chisora fight.  This is fucking brilliant mate you are saying the things everyone is thinking. I backed fury to everyone who thought I was nuts before the klitschko fight then he did what he did. I'm going more for chisora and usyk these days. Chisora even against haye if you slow it down when he gets knocked out is still swinging! Love your content mate I'm not gonna lie I was a bit watery eyed watching you interview Alan shearer,that was someone living out their childhood dream.  Anyway good on you mate :)
Tyson was fuming from word go , seems to be on drugs or something
Smashed it with this response Brian. Been following you since the Football Manager days with Spencer and it's weird to say but I felt nothing but pride for you watching this video. Keep doing you mate!
Puts it how it is. Immaculately. Every time.
That was true journalism True Geordie you did a great job interviewing Tyson. You could not have shown more respect to both fighters. Tyson behaved very badly I was a fan not anymore, he doesn't care about the fans.
Absolutely nailed it. Those with access for so many years are just embarrassed you showed them up for such cowards. Totally right you’re job isn’t to accept the fist answer and low ball. They do as they’re concerned they’ll lose access.  Spot on though when you said what does that say about Fury’s character and what does that say about their professional skills. Well done sir
He was definitely on a comedown I hope he gets more help but that interview was actually hard to watch
I love you Gordie. Awesome stuff as always... P.S fuck you Tyson
Good man Geordie 👍❤️
We need shorts of this interview!!
💯 agree with everything you said 👏
Usyk is older than Fury too. Fury is the GOAT of being a blabber mouth idiot
The less said the better, the interview itself propelled you and you have my respect, however, there was no need for you to explain yourself.
Respect mate but can’t try flex on fury but aye your right mate
You forget the most important thing... You'll never get another interview with BIG JOHN FURYYYY
Bang on.
Well said sir !!🎉
Well said, you told Tyson what we would all like to tell him
Love True Geordie man. What a guy
You're as annoying as Fury tbh
the deeper you dig into tyson, you'll realise what a pos he is as a person
Brian, yet again. You did this perfectly. Had the perfect response for it. Handled it like a man. Made me laugh and made me listen. I love Tyson fury but how he acted was like a left and right hook, I’m so happy that you have handled it like this. Absolute legend
On fire here hahahahaha! Apart from the cancer joke. Been line for line perfect across them two videos but ah well.
Sounded great pal. Could have done things differently but would you have got the point across you wanted. Well done mate keep it up!
This video was facts, nothing but facts ! Honestly Geordie, well fucking done! You keep doing what you’re doing because we all enjoy you and your videos! Congratulations on 2 millions subscribers and keep doing what you’re fucking doing! Inspirational mate! x
Invite me for 1 podcast with you I know everything about boxing probably  more than him and what you said was so right chisora shouldn't even be fighting for british title he loses for a living
i think fury was being harsh you arent little lol
👏 👏 👏
I think it was mainly a bit of banter from Fury he may have been agitated a little bit but by nowhere near the same extent that people are blowing this up as . True Geordie is having the biggest egotistical w@nk parade over himself over the interview.  The way he is swimming in his own juices you would think the guy just cured cancer.
Please read this comment I'm a crazy boxing fan I live boxing and what you did is what I wanted to do but wasnt famous enough to get him. I think Tyson fury is best ever but what you said was right hes fighting an ok fighter not a world class fighter to give him Pay day an I guarantee he wont try too hurt him either points win or chisora retires in the corner probably allready sorted out
spot on
Everyone knows you the best mate!
Tyson unfortunately did not seem  in a  great mood . From the start a little unbalanced . Tyson is wonderful . I👍
I think your the only person that out talked the gypsy king before he stormed off lol , your allowed to have your say, I find it rude that he thinks he has the ability to tell people when and how to speck, and how they should act around him,  in my honestly opinion I don't think he's a  peoples champion .. i just think he's a bully whos got very lucky in life who happens to be champion you did nothing wrong.. free country after all keep have your say!.. because people still watch you
I get why True was pressing Fury but it got to the point where it felt like he was beating a dead horse. It’s like no answer Fury gave was good enough and he finally just got annoyed. He’s clearly not going to admit it’s not a great match. Could be a tune up fight to something big or he’s just done trying to fight the best who knows. Just ask something else and find out what you can instead of rewording the same question 10 times 😂
Booty juice is dining out on this storm in a tea cup. Step in the ring and fight somebody...
When sucking up goes wrong. True Geordie has been kissing Tyson Fury’s butt for a longtime thinking that will put him in Fury’s good graces. Glad this happened because it will make True Geordie more objective instead of kissing Fury’s backside.
New to your channel,  here after seeing clips of the fury interview...fury a dosser
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I don’t think Tyson actually respects anyone Brian. I do think he was in a weird mood, and was hell bent on being an a*hole. Big respect to you for doing this video and standing up for it. Also you don’t have to be in their industry to interview them, that’s the whole point of an interview. 👍🏻
12:08
You’re doing a great job dude! Love listening to your channel 😊👍🏼
Big up to you bruh... So glad that the interview went out and people can see the real fury... He is not what he says he is... However u can't have think like this like your interview was perfect... there were some things to work on... 1 thing is researching more about his potential opponents... coz he is not the boxrec champ he is wbc champ and there are a lot of names there before dereck... ie Martin Bakole or Hunter... anyway despite all of this your interview was way better than most of these so called pro interviewer's out here. Always think about growth and improvements above all👊🏿
Mad respect Geordie
I love tyson but I didn't see any issues with your interview tbh 👈 it's banter .
You had me until you called Ricky Gervais and Russell Brand 'intellectuals'... bit of a stretch
Spot on in everything in this.
Fury was pissed off before he even sat down. I think you handled him very well.
Usyk is now taunting Fury for dodgin the fight
Spot on here mate but I think Tyson is just init for the money now and that’s why he’s reacting
Think you are spot on TG. Only thing is, as someone going through cancer……its not nice to joke about it.  Keep up the good work tho
Tyson Fury's new record after the interview and this reaction video: 32-2-1.
True geordie is a little wanker
1 min im buying that fight 🤣
Fair play to you you asking fury the questions that half the media have not got the balls ask him you got my respect
honestly from the start of that video Tyson Fury didn't want to be there I think he knew what he was going to get with true Gordy. I can almost see all the people sucking Tyson Fury off just by his attitude towards true Gordy  Questions.
Disagree with Geordie on a lot, but he's totally right here. I absolutely cringed when AJ vs Fury was announced. It just seemed stupid and one-sided. Them, when that fell through, and Chisora was announced, i literally couldn't believe it. Its very hard to defend against the assumption that he's running from Usyk when he's fighting an old guy who he's already beat twice, after another fight fell through with a guy who has lost 3 out of his 4 fights.
bro well fucking said. absolutely bang on here, tyson let himself down forsure and this response was perfecto.
I have so much respect for you after that interview keep up the good work mate
You against big John ahaha
What u said is SPOT ONNNNNNNNN 🖤
Brilliant Geordie, I unsubscribed when you fell for Fury's nonsense. I've resubscribed after this. True Geordie, true legend now
Fury seems to have gone of the rails again over the past year or two
shagger
What u said 👑👑
Well handled 👏🏾
Respect for this bloke went through the roof in the last few days. Pure class.
Truest man on YT. Agree with everything you said, a lot of your opinions were opinions of normal fans out there and we appreciate that you have a platform to bring that to everyone’s attention. Big love, congrats on 2 mil ❤🙏🏻
Buddy having a mental breakdown on camera because he got hate comments
You don't need to be a boxer or punch someone to knock them out. That's why Muhammad Ali beat the best with words before he even fought them then just to rub it in he continued to do it in the ring... You sir have done many proud. Tyson Fury is a legend but far from perfect and his next fight is proper bolloks...
There’s not much more to say then the TG has unpicked him, we all love fury for the way helps the mental side of it and TG has really opened him up to show the truth
FYI, you don't need to convince anyone that you're "an annoying prick" 😂  but definitely enjoying you sticking it to Fury, AJ next please
Nailed the original interview and nailed the response too 👏👏👏
Think Tyson was on rag week bless him
Good on you True Geordie
Just can’t wait till someone drops fury
You might not be part of the "boxing media" but you asked the questions we the boxing fans actually want him to be asked because you've got more in common with the average person on the street than Gareth A Davies and all the other boxing writers
Fury criticism getting lots of claps and yet this same clown can't take his nose from out of Jake Paul's crack
Articulated perfectly, nice and clear, unlike a particular journalists tinted glasses…
I've had so much respect for this guy ever since I heard of him, absolute legend
Big fan but if I was you I would be careful what you say because you know he will slap you if he Bumps into you!.
I wouldn’t even go as far to say that Derick always gives it his all, because it’s only recently that he has been impressing the fans with his work ethic. The reason why Derick is popular is because of his style of using a high frequency of risky power punches.
Umar from @ifl TV has taken this personally, as he should. His ‘interviews’ in Frank Warrens cosy office with pre-approved questions which Frank turns up to with pages of notes. It’s not an interview, two actors doing lines…lines of scripts not the other lines…probably.
Top man for the holding him for account and also the responce  wow, this is going to go viral again cant wait for tyson repsonce, and also no we dont want the fuckin chizora fight - money for the boys load bollocks! fight dillian
Fair play TG been a fan for a while I like the Kid that supports you on the majority episodes aswell you both compliment one another. You had the minerals to ask the obvious questions that should be asked. And now to fire back post interview. Bravo. Massive Fury fan but over the past few years I genuinely believe this is a clone version replacement Fury. Something needs to be investigated. For sure. Either that or he's sold out which is a devastating notion.
Khabib Have Said Tyson Fury Is The Pound For Pound Boxer Currently TYSON ALWAYS GO FOR THE TOUGHEST CHALLENGE STUPID
Asshole Davies and umar ifl umar can do one
Wait Tyson thought he would be the first ever heavyweight to have more than one trilogy? Does the name Evander Holyfield have no meaning anymore?
True Geordie absolutely Brilliant, you did nothing wrong whatsoever, Fury vs Chisora is a joke and you have to be Blind not to see it! Frank Warren must be getting desperate to allow this to happen!!
Calm down, it ended up in a rant (you was doing so well when you started) , you've got an opinion just like Tyson Fury and other people, and while T Fury is trying to promote the fight, you seem to be doing the opposite so it's understandable T Fury would be pissed off.  D Chisora might have lost a few fights, but some was close and many thought he had won a couple of those fights, and the last fight with T Fury was 10 years ago - D Wilder was totally overwhelmed by T Fury in their second fight, but did much better in their third fight (not ten years later), and you have just to look at who D Chisora fought in the last 10 years - D Chisora is still a credibly opponent - T Fury not going to fight Usyk, J Joyce, AJ, D Dubois or J Parker in his next fight, and this probably a keep busy fight for Usyk, but D Chisora will try to bring his A-game like always, and it's a domestic fight with a good under-card so people will pay to see that, it's not for you to say if they are being ripped off or not - Mike Tyson avoided L Lewis for years, even payed step aside money, these guy's are out for the biggest payday, and Usyk is the biggest fight out there for T Fury with AJ, but that's not happening yet.
Geordie is right on this one 👍 Fury clearly wasn’t in the mood, only had 40 minutes and should have taken Joshua then Usyk.  Regardless of Tyson’s fights he is losing credibility in terms of history and not fighting the best of the best.
Decent enough interview but you shouldn't have allowed him to speak to you like that. Should have stopped him right away ask what his fucking problem is.
Geordie thinks he's the man now because of his ass licking subscribers. The man is cringe and would melt if Fury fronted him.
Personally say what you feel haha
What happened was he said good man to end off the interview - then pressed a button on the screen to cancel the call - but it did not go to plan. He then uttered the words and then had to play along.
Bald by choice is worse 😅 no excuse then!
It's so frustrating when you see these  "champions" take easy fights and the only way to voice your frustration is in a Tweet or FB post.  Thank you, TG,  for actually letting the "man of the people" know how the people actually feel. He expected you to come on and figuratively lick his balls.
mad respect you mate you acted very professional
Obviously your alittle butt hurt gordie....grow up!!!!
Belter mate 👊
Fury is too arrogant
Tyson Fury.. cooked! Gareth A Davies.. cooked! Umar IFL.. cooked! Spencer Fearon.. cooked!  Quite some ..  I cannot disagree with TG here.
Brian I couldn’t agree with you more mate. Even if he doesn’t agree with your points or doesn’t want to answer the questions that’s fine but he needs to keep things professional. Or he just doesn’t agree to any interviews.
Legend
Also cocaine plus Tampared with his gloves remember
I dnt know ur explaining so much to these dump people F them
He’s just a sniff head
Boosted your views even more mate, I'd start asking More difficult questions to Boxers, good strategy 👍😂
Should have asked him why we've never seen him drink his energy drink too 🤔🤣
Yeah Fury made himself look like a proper asshole in your interview.
The way you interviewed him was great. At the end of the day he was on YOUR podcast! So, if he doesn't want to answer questions then that's fine but it also doesn't give him the right to tell you what you can and can't ask on YOUR podcast.
My english is not good but seems you are raising the bet.. so yes, you have balls.
Brilliant video
Here’s the thing Geordie & for the record I’m a fan of yours. However with that said here are the facts. Tyson had no benefit doing this interview other than a little plug for his fight. He’s mostly doing you a favor. Although your questions were legitimate there’s a time to hold them and there’s a time to fold them. He’s taking the time to bless your channel. Why mess with the guys pockets and taint his upcoming fight. I could see asking this question once or maybe even a follow up question..but after that let it go. Because no one likes being blindsided on a interview & backed in a corner. Again, although they were legit questions you should of moved on. You’ll get the benefit of having a viral video and make some short term money but long term I believe it will hurt you and make high profile guest apprehensive to come on your show.
You got owned by Tyson 😂
Thank you for doing this Geordie Umar IFL TV and Gareth Davies embarrassing
Keep up the good work. With the size of them balls your going places. Cheers big fella . Mike g
Nailed the interview with him and nailed the response to it 👏👏👏   Please unblock me on twitter as I haven't been disrespectful to you mate. Love your show mate 👏
Your just as big headed as Fury
AJ should fight wilder and Tyson wen he had the chance and now AJ got beat by guy half he’s size you say Tyson should fight AJ the bum 😂
Why doesn't fury fight Frank sanchez, mickeal hunter, Joyce, usyk
I just think he was expected an interview about the fight. Then when you said things to mess with the fight promotion I see exactly why he got upset. You kept on about it. Aj wasted to much time and usek or however his name is spelled didn't wanna fight when he wanted to. So I get why he did this.
Bang on 👍 must o been a scaff on the rigs 🤣👍
AJ list 3 fights he got no belts he was avoiding the big fights why should Tyson the top the league fight bums wen they got nothing now
You called Fury out and proved how much of a narcissist and materialistic ego he really is. It's all about the money and fame for Tyson. He's a walking contradiction.  Keep up the good work and keep the podcasts coming 👍
Ah man whata mess. But hella justified.
Thank you! Excellent work Sir😂😂
1st man to beat Fury 🤣🤣
Watched you from the periphery for a while never really engaged too much, but this has turned you into an absolute legend in my book. Fury is deep up his own rectum, excellent journalism.
Got swallow you’re pride Tyson mugged you right of 😂
Top man Geordie we are supporting you...
tyson whas not in the right mind when he came on, the moment the interview started, he stated that he needed to 'train' , you can see his ego in that moment, he whas allready playing down the interview from the beginning..
Tyson Fury’s meltdown in that interview was way worse than AJ’s meltdown after Usyk but got half the coverage, wonder why 🤔
'If you know how'😂😂
👍
AJ was avoiding the wilder fight and Tyson but wants fight guy half he’s size and still loses
Geordie went hard at the end.. Nothing but truth. Go on lad..
Fury mentioned the double trilogy quite a while back but you have shown him how we feel about it I would rather david haye get ago
Never been a tru G fan... But I am now... I totally agree theses question's needed to be said.. And the only reason people bit is you told the truth..we live now in a day and age the truth hurts.. And again I agree tyson should not boxing dell boy.. I'm amazed you didn't point out the stadium holds 92,000 and he's only sold 56,000...i will watch the fight on strike out free sport streaming...... And still want my money back.. Well done tru G.. Words have energy and you used the right ones... Xx peace brother xx
AJ lost 3 fights and to guy half he’s size 😂 why should Tyson fight a bum
I'm Probably Gonna Watch The Fight... BUT... I Ain't Gonna Pay for It...
I don’t understand people who are bald by choice
Tyson said “good man” before he went on his rant. I don’t think he was as serious as people think
Great Podcaster
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾. Finally...This could be the best video of the year. I don't think I've seen a video like this on YouTube where every minute was full of truth, clarity and bravery. Thank you for being our mouthpiece  saying what every sane person has been screaming at those blinded by the Fury's aura..( cough Gareth A Davies). I'm so happy they have all been called out.
You still don’t get it! Who could he have fought in December who was a bigger name? Answer is No one - do some homework before you interview people - and be thankful he gave you 7 seconds of fame
You should fight Derrick if you think he can’t fight
@TrueGeordie happy to see someone doing real journalism for once. All these clown wannabe journalists handing softball questions to Fury and sucking him off so they can hopefully get a second interview is a joke. Keep doing you and remember people love hating on winners and you sir are a winner.
Well said
You Tyson be funny fight 😂
Geordies got it bang on with this one! You said what were all thinking tbh lol. He didn't like it! Shown his true colours everyone thinks and he acts as this people's person but is he really..? AJ/Usyk are actually genuinely good respectable kind athlete's at least !
You exposed the gypsy king  !
Joking about cancer scumbag
You handled yourself great and Fury overreacted. There needs to be tougher questions and less of “oh you aren’t a boxer”
Testicular cancer joke was fucking weird and forced . Coming of like a full fledged flog in this video 👎.
Anyone know the pundits that shamed TG for his interview with Tyson.
Wonder if TG will respond to Andrew tates comments about him
I love true Geordie, my inspiration
Not many have the minerals or integrity to challenge their heroes. Fair play.
Go on TG, proud of you for speaking up!
I hope Umar & Gareth A Davies take notes from True Geordie! Put them firmly in their place 👏👏👏
The only real, no nonsense, straight talking person he had in his career was his uncle Peter Fury. They’re not on speaking terms anymore. Tells you everything about Tyson and his dad
Are history and legacy really the same though? History is more what you've done, accomplishments etc. Legacy is more the impact you have had, it's a fine line but i don't think they are they same.
So many truth bombs in this… boxing journalism is none existent! Just fanboys with cameras 💯
I fucking love this guy
Stop wining, u are right Chisora should not fight Fury again, but is good for him to get a pay day
Fury was obviously on a comedown 🤣 his mood was shitty from the start.  Fair play to you Brian, I thought it was a decent interview. The questions weren't wrong, you were merely asking a boxer about what he thinks of current affairs. It's a fucking podcast.   I was a big fan of Fury, but the waffle he's put out this year has really soured it.
😂💪
✅✅✅✅👊🏾
I saw the IFL video criticising you interview... IFL interviews are dreadful, and Gareth Davies is just a Tyson fan boy. That was upset you heut Tyson feels.   Most us boxing fans have started following other boxing channels like ID boxing and even boxing social. Can't stand IFL anymore. Just a bunch of brown nosers afraid to to ask real questions.
Reeeeespect to the man that does his job properly 👍why aye man 💪
Fury said usyk wasn’t in his era but Joshua is, both turned pro and won their first world title in the same year, usyk won his first title just 10 month ls after fury
Big W, Brian. I think you’re a top interviewer :)
There’s many in boxing media (iFL TV, Boxing Social, Behind The Gloves, ESPN, BT) that haven’t asked Fury serious questions since 2018. Respect True Geordie
Almost 7,000 languages on God's green earth and Geordie decided to speak straight facts.
You're right, rather see you and him than him and chisora
Tyson is not in a good place mentally right now
You're the goat
I thought your interview was great , Tyson has so many paid ass-kissers surrounding him he's forgotton how to deal with reality.
Top man  You should get in the ring with him  Better than his next fight !
Tyson has a wonderful mechanism whereby if he doesn’t like your question he’ll say “I don’t get involved with anyone else’s business” and if your question benefits him, he’ll get involved in anyones business.   Question about Eddie Hearn, Joshua, football, you’ll get an answer.   Question about Chisora not being good enough, Daniel Kinahan, drug testing? “I don’t get involved in other peoples business”.
One of the reasons Tyson has been so successful is that he is willing to take easy/warm-up/tick-over fights and then step up and take big fights when the time is right. Unlike AJ, who had hard fights back-to-back, pleasing fans but ultimately losing and losing his air of invincibility. But, in my opinion, if you're going to take an easy fight, just be honest. Don't try and fool the public.
It looked staged to me.
Nothing but love for this interview!!! Finally showed Tysons true colors. Mental Health, more like covering up a steroid ban  :)
Class mate well said
Fury looked from minute 1 he didn't want to be there clearly frustrated. He's the man but fleecing the public like this with a complete mis match is a joke i've lost a bit of respect for fury as a result of his reaction what a shame 🤷🏻‍♂ Brian keep up the great content love your interviews and your humour 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Tyson looks like he’s back on the sniff
Yeah that head kick was crazy
true geordie the goat no cap
Sooner he said I got be out here to the gym so can’t be long with this …that told you he not want be there for the interview. TG people who moaned about you probably works for Sky and TalkSPORT lol
I'm liking true geordie again 🙏 amazing job 👏👌
Respect TG, it was a very revealing interview and that's rare for an interview with Fury for all the reasons you mentioned. The paying public needed this considering all of the bs around the sport of boxing lately. Keep doing what you're doing sir!
Hit the nail on the head with this whole saga Brian. Good to see someone have the balls to challenge the guy. Nobody is above being questioned respectfully which is exactly what you did.
Real G!
You were honest with him and called him out, not many interviewers have the balls to do that big respect to go TG 👊❤
I predict a Wilder podcast in the future. lol
I hope Gareth A. Davies watched this. if you know, you know
Amazing interview, tyson was being a prick to be fair
You asked the fans questions and we love you for it mate! Great interviewer you’ve got something there no fucks given and your real questions don’t change and you don’t budge, massive respect! Not many people do if any go about it like you do. Can’t wait for the next one try and get Connor Benn for an interview you’ll respect him.
Can't speak for the rest but I'll not be paying to watch Fury vs Chisora 3. The fight makes no sense to me, apart from a decent pay day for Chisora!
This whole video was filled with the biggest of facts from begining to end but i am still surprised someone with such a big platform is being so honest about stuff like this, its refeshing to see the BS getting called out with Fury just trying to dupe boxing fans with this garbage fight that is just a free cash grab fight against an old, broken, damaged fighter
Tbf don't joke about cancer , it's not on 👎🏻
this is class
True Geordie has balls…..but is right tho! He speaks for the people, he’s only saying what people all over the country are saying. As Geordie says, celebrities take the public’s money but don’t ever want to answer to the public. Celebrity status aside we are all just people and none of us are beyond Criticism
Spot on mate. Good man. Very good man here
Can you imagine how mortified the fury Dan boys are going to be after this one😂, smashed it again Brian mate 👍
Nice rant man, nothing but facts. Respect.
Excellent work here Geord - straight talking and fair play - top man
You've upset the top G and now the top gypsy 😂😭🤣
Tg you’re the man! Well done!
I'm a big fan of Tyson Fury & I enjoy the unpredictability of some of his interviews but your bang, on cos he constantly contridicts himself.  Tyson says whatever he wants & too many sycophants let him away with it.  Well done for asking him the questions about the Chisora fight, I wouldn't pay a £1 to watch it
You did a very good enterview
Massive respect for you mate, you r one of the very few ppl witch I agree with almost 100% no matter the topic and who truly speaks his mind without any bs. Keep it up :)
True Geordie other so call "boxing journalist"  ar afraid to ask the questions you asked BC they lick up his ass knowing if they ask what the fans want to know they know he will never get another interview with him. You politely put him on the spot just because he's the heavyweight champion doesn't mean you're below him in anyway that was one of the best interviews we're an interviewer challenged Tyson Fury on his bulshit and he couldn't handle the criticism that taken the Dereck Chisora fight was a fight that nobody wanted to see for the so called people champion he really let himself down in that interview you are nothing but being honest and respectable to him even telling him that you were one of his biggest fans you would think he would have been nice to you but it just shows his true colours they always say, you never meet your hero they will always disappoint you I used to be a fury fan but I got sick of all his he lies all the time the way he was going on about Joe Joyce /usyk saying they were not in his generation & him saying that they were changing their nappies when he was winning World titles what the man does not realise that they are older than him I'm wearing the amateurs all their life we're Fury was turned professional and was only fighting bums until he bet Klitschko then he went on a bender for 3 years he cam back and don't exactly what he done in all his career took warm up fights had a trilogy with Wilder and now he's back doing the same but when you say it to him he cannot hack it he cannot take any criticism and that's why I think usyk will beat him that's if and that's a big if he fights him brilliant interview glad it went viral👍🥊🥊
And yet his takes the loss about cancer trying to be funny yet someone talks “jokes” about mental health and you start throwing you’re toys out the pram 🤷🏻‍♂️
To come at TF's recent antics from a different angle, he setting up a unification with AU with himself as a black gloves fighter.
I’d pay to watch the True Geordie vs the Gypsy King because I’m fairly certain the true Geordie loose but he has cannon arms. 😂 But other than that, this is just Tyson helping out a mate, he shouldn’t do it we know he will finish Chisora or he will take the loss and get a cousin of a cousin to make a massive bet for him to loose and make a f*ck load of money and come back destroy Chisora in the rematch, hopefully he goes for top 15 heavyweights.
Thank you 👍👍
Damn
Good stuff Geordie the man of the people
IFL are on the Matchroom payroll.. they don't dare press Eddie. It's obvious
Fair play I'm a big fury fan but he's slowly showing us his true colours glad someone finally asked the awkward questions that no one else would 🥊🥊🥊
Good stuff Geordie the man of the people
Who do you want him to fight next? Don't say AJ! He just threw away a chance he clearly did not deserve..That ship has sailed.AJ is now Wilder fodder.
Spot on from TG. Even if they had the balls the YouTube boxing interviewers can’t put it on Fury or anyone else because they would be banned.  99.9% of the time fury interviews are meaningless. He’s a walking contradiction. It’s would be good to see him give TG a proper interview face to face.  He is still by far the best heavyweight in the ring
Best UK podcaster by a million miles, there will always be criticism when youre as known as you are and ik you are grown enough to take it with a pinch of salt. Keep doing you and dont change for anyone. This is why we watch you. True is in the name. Thanks for all you do for us <3
Class mate
🔥👍
Absolute respect to you. You do indeed have big balls
The fuckern boyyyy, said it word for word lad. You shouldn’t have to explain any of this, class play 👏🏼
Well done TG. Nail on head!!!
The little boxing circle are so stingy towards you for asking him questions lol fuck them man.
Yet again quality video and spot on
Well said!
Love tyson fury but I thought it was a brilliant interview asked the hard questions  tyson just spat his dummy out made tyson look bad not brian
Good reasonable interview. Fury wasn't in the right mood to sit down, I think. It's just all a big shame. Good to see some good come out of it.
Could've edited the normal final question quite nicely for this one   'how would you like to be remembered?'  'T0sspot. Bearded, bald-headed t0sser'
Brian doesn't need to justify himself, but has the integrity to offer his fans an insight into the Fury interview. I like Brian's interview style, it's open and honest and he's built a platform on those same virtues. Well done, great content 👏.
Respect for keeping it real. Tyson is the best heavyweight. But I'm just sick of his circus act.. He's ruining his reputation. So props for calling him out on it.
TG 100% legend born and bred. And that’s coming from a Mackem. Every thing he said on this video was spot on. For me the main reason Fury spat his dummy out was because his ego took a verbal slap from Brian. Well done lad! 👍🏻
Spot on lad and as for that muppet Gareth A Davies he’s so far up fury arse he’s got a brown moustache keep smashing it mate
7:21 😭😭😭
Legendddd
It's a bit mad how on point he is
Ifl TV, Gareth A Davies etc called out to fuck on here. Professional dick riders. They all suck Eddie Hearn off aswell
He's speaking straight facts
Tbh I think he’s back on the gear
Well said
Full ratings to you True Geordie and this video is spot on as a follow up
👊🏻
I don't know that much about you or your "origin story" but having watched the full interview, I don't think the questions you asked were disrespectful to either fighter and were quite on point with regards to the PPV issue. Fury is an emotional guy like so many fighters of the past and he just didn't want any of that on that day. He is an intelligent guy though - very intelligent - so he'll know that he did you bad there and I'm very confident that he'll send you a kitkat chunky and a 6 pack of McEwans by way of apology very shortly.
7:20 That caught me off guard, amazing.
Dude you were right to say the other reporters are angry and shown up...  you asked the questions they should of!
💯 on everything you just said 👍🏼
He should have waited for AJ fight
He was also asking for 500 million for a fight then said he’d only fight if it was free to watch now it’s on PPV🤣😂
You interviewed the undertaker not many people can say that, fury couldn’t handle your questions that others didn’t have the balls to ask. Love it geordie!
Spot on mate!  You did the job that "boxing journalists" should have been doing for years.  Fans have endured this sewage of a sport for too long.  Well done Geordie!!!
Oh and well said mate.. love ya work
Fury is smart, a coward and a fake sure, but smart, he knows Usyk and AJ are much bigger threats than Wilder ever was, so he's just doing whatever he can to avoid them.
I'm a fury fan but totally with Brian on this one. Tyson wasn't on the right frame off mind for that interview
TG dont get angry over the bullshit from the Fury fanboys. theyre fking delusional and also believe all the bullshit that comes out of Furys mouth
"Jumped on the scene and boom, put it on him" Lol
As much as I love Tyson Fury and what he represents, I must say more and more cracks are starting to appear lately. I hope he sorts it out while it’s not too late. Personally I don’t think Geordie did anything out of order.
I have got tickets to Tyson be chisora, so easy to get, usually good fights sell out in minutes, no problem this time even a day after they went out on sale
Woosah Geordie😆
At this point you’re lucky Tyson don’t slap you lol you wouldn’t say any of this to his face 😂
Brian coming in with the heat as always. Your interviews are fantastic  so let the crabs sit in their barrel mate.
Used to be a big fury fan but really want to see USYK beat him now
This is as good as the original interview. All reasonable points well made 👏
Facts. All FACTS 🤷🙌
I beg Brian doesn't get in trouble for those cancer jokes, bloody hilarious 😂
Brilliant Synopsis of the whole interview 👍🏻
True Geordie for prime minister!
Yes lad.
Would've been an absolute blast if geordie had interviewed Alex Ferguson 10 years ago 😄
I very well said fella, the big balls bit nearly fell of the chair laughing. Please keep asking the questions others are scared to ask great work..
nah
Lol don't do this Brian its cringe as fuck.  Accept the L.  You loosing my respect man.  Edit: after watching video...meh I'm actually on the fence. Lost some respect for you both, mostly you. This video is a bad look... Very petty stuff.
You made your point in a respectful way in the first interview, but when he answered you you should have moved on. No point of trying to make him agree with you. And this video was bullshit. But I like your content so keep working
Gareth Davies will be on suicide watch right now 😭😭😭
this man is the most respectable journalist on any platform. i stand by that.
He's a gypsy.  They tell tales.  It's in his DNA.  As for retirement, all that does is get him out of the testing pool so he can party hard.  That's McGregor's trick.
Most journalists just suck off the person that there interviewing I have a lot of respect for Brian for asking the questions that me and others wanted to here
Also well done for standing up for yourself
Most journalists just suck off the person that there interviewing I have a lot of respect for Brian for asking the questions that me and others wanted to here
Still waiting for your video about ufc 280.
T.G that was legendary, spoke for all us boxing fans,  this fight is a piss take
Tyson is fast turning himself into something know wants in boxing. Your interview showed what we were all thinking. Much respect
If fury EVER  talks about people fighting bums and tomatoe cans… well pot kettle black!
Broke it down brilliantly. One of my biggest frustrations in life is interviewer’s not asking the questions that they should. Always the same with Fury or Warren, anything they don’t quite like, they get theirs backs up go all defensive, so interviewers go easy on them. Umar pussy foots around them and asks them safe questions that were probably vetted before rolling, whereas when he interviews Eddie he lets him have because he knows that Eddie will talk to anyone. Every point you made in the Fury interview was valid and he knew it!
You couldn’t have said it any better mate you wasn’t in the wrong a single bit. To many journalists pussyfoot around these big time fighters/celebs but not you. Good on you keep it up you’ll only get better and better 👌🙏
LEGEND!!!! TG success deserved!!!
Brilliant, loved how you wound him up. However 1 thing I would disagree with is that Del has more fight in him now than he did in their second fight. Dels second half of his career he's been a much better fighter and trained far better. I do though agree this fight is pointless but I'm happy Chisora will get a nice big juicy payday and he can go off into the sunset as he deserves it for the great memories and wars he's gave us.
I agree with all of this except for calling Ricky Gervais and Jordan Peterson heavyweight intellectuals.
You’ve had plenty of pats on the back and here’s another one. You represent us fans much more so than the so called journalists in the sport. Hats off to you fella
I saw Gareth Davies with IFL both criticising your questioning. Absolute BS for them of all people. The kinds of questions you hear THEM ask and they have the gall to criticise you??? We've all seen when Tyson's got one on him, he doesn't exactly play ball, when he's like "I'm not interested in that, next question" it's fucking rude, but it's not like you're the only one he's done that with. You handled it excellently and dug deeper than any other boxing journalist without being rude. I think Gareth Davies and IFL could learn a lot from you!
How you reacting to your own interview LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Smashed it georgie, big up you for sticking to your guns
Need TG to replace 99% of these rimmer boxing interviewers
Just watch out for Furry bodyguard, Gareth A Davies! He will blow you away with his cherry vape!
Proper questioning. Salute and a breath of fresh air.  Hold him to account. Keep it up TG
Legend ! You've got some bollox which is fukin rare these days fair play 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️
You simply done your job professionally. As normal Tysons naricisstic demon cant control itself and lashed out like a spoiled child. Even to the extent he called you badly ffs, but tysons hypocritical nature is nothing new.. I feel tyson has skeletons in his boxing closet,like his association with Daniel Kinahan etc showed. He's simply giving his friend an easy payday and being greedy himself.He totally embarrassed himself and he knows it. And he's far from one of the greatest IMO.
True Jaw-Ache dining out of this. The lineal champ will keep preparing for WaR and has forgotten about this bum and his lack of respect.
The questions asked were the questions I wanted him to be asked, the boxing youtube channels won't ask them coz they'll just get blanked forever. The fights a farce, and Fury knows it.
Absolutely bang on buddy ☺️😉👍🏻
grow up man
Anyone know why darek said tyson slapped a gag order on him for this fight?
Tyson’s rant is evidence that he has mental issues yet again… maybe Chisora can catch him by surprise
Everything you said was true Brian. We're  all behind you.
You asked all the questions people are really wanting to ask.  Good on you mate.
You're saying facts.. fury is one sensitive prick
Hottest topic on all the boxing channels.. The notion you're supposed to ask questions in a certain order.. Says who? You're your own man!
became a sub and a true geordie fan after the Fury interview.   really happy that your not an 'access journalist' you ask the question we want answered even though you may not get another interview with him
Pushing his own fans away with his bs
You're a topman
Ignore the fury bum lickers. I didn't know of you before this interview so well done, and thanks
IFL TV on blast!
Not only is the fight not worth the PPV, To then charge £100+ for the majority of the seats actually at the fight is ridiculous
Brian you don’t need to explain yourself or justify yourself to the doubters that’s their problem. I’ve followed boxing all my life and I’m nearly 60 now. You hit the nail on the head mate and as much as I’m a Fury fan he was out of order that day. I was one of the people that didn’t like him at first but warmed to him when he came back. I wanted him to be the champion he’s supposed to be, hopefully he will be big enough to reach out to you and say fair cop …
We all knew the interview was going this way from the very second he spoke. Didn't really want to be there having questions put to him
Spot on mate. That interview was a breath of fresh air. Don't change! 👊
Muhammad Ali the only people's champion there was, was more humble in life, then Tyson will ever be
Belter 👊
Opened up with questions about KSI and Conor Benn, it was a set up, it was the plan all along for him to snap
It was a great interview, you did your job well and gain my respect as well as a lot of others
I think we’ve finally found TF’s boogeymen lol I’m TF’s fanboy but 1:0 for True Geordie on this one
You can milk this again tomorrow
"The people's champ"  How much is the ppv?  Cost of living and food banks being a thing, people champ my arse.
So refreshing to hear somebody question fury. Fury sits there with gareth a davies and says black is white, white is black, yadayadayads bullshit this, lie that and all gareth does is sit there saying yahhh yahhhh yahhhh and then takes him at his word every time despite his biploar nature
Not wrong.! I would pay to see you vs fury! No way I’ll be paying to watch fury murder Chisora again!
GET ANTHONY JOSHUA INTERVIEWED
Lol Fury saying it sold out is load of bollocks, pretty sure you can still get tickets.
True Geordie
You did an amazing job TG! Nothing you said was disrespectful so if he wants to go crazy that’s his bag
Who the hell are you to tell furry who he should be fighting? idiot... It’s not fury fault that his greatness makes for uncompetitive fights.. Chisora almost beat usyk.. Usyk destroyed AJ.. Yet you wanna say chisora isn’t good?? AJ vs fury wouldn’t be competitive would be a first round knock out for fury...The second wilder fight was a complete domination yet everyone asked for a third and wilder got dominated again..Ajs lost three of his last five fights same as chisora..
Haha all those crappy boxing journalists swipe to 14m 50secs.  Never really listed to true geordie before the fury interview.well done for keeping it real!
Brian this video is unnecessary, you're a fantastic interviewer.
Honestly Tyson looked like it was on sniff in that interview
I wish you had asked him about his "donations" to charity. You would have seen a real flip out then. Kugan asked him after years of pressure from fans and Fury nearly killed him and it was never mentioned again
Great interview BUT I must say …there is only ONE KING FROM THESE SHORES and that’s the Lion Lennox Lewis ….. he fought many like TF and AJ … beat them all, ducked NOBODY BUT…… TF and AJ has NEVER EVER faced a TRUE WORLD CLASS BOXER like Lennox Lewis ….. Lennox Lewis beat everyone of his era PLUS beat VK who reigned for a DECADE after LL retired …… THATS an Undisputed HW Champion……
Well done brian 💪
Introducing the reigning, defending, undisputed YouTube heavyweight champion of the world...True Geordie!!!....and his opponent. tyson fury.....that's the equivalent of him berating u for not being boxing champ..great interview loved fury but now he's lost 2 the True Geordie he's history 😉
fury defo likes the limelight, great boxer tho
FIGHT HIM IN MMA
Well said TG...well f*cking said. Integrity at it's best
Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall fury that is 😂
Well said TG❤️
Disrespecting the heavy weight champion of the world. Showing your true colours. Sad click bait twat.
Fury looked foolish and petulant during that whole interview and tbh Wilder put a serious dent in him across that trilogy so it wouldn’t totally surprise me if Del did put him over.
Agree with everything you've said
love you bri bri, made fury embarrass himself, always a quality interviewer, never in doubt
Good for you Geordie. These fighters are too used to having their arse licked by the boxing media.
Fuckin eh buddy! Well said
Using people and negativity for clout and fame again lol Used a mans suicide to make a career now wanna use insults at a pro boxer for views... What a pos
It's ironic how you speak of tysons ego... Be very careful with how you handle this wave of support mate, it could be your downfall.
It was a fantastic interview and you were spot on. Tyson could simply walk into something like WWE after he’s done with boxing.
Fury couldn't get a top opponent for Dec 3rd and got who he could. He valued his timescale more than fighting to other fighters timescales. True Geordie is an opportunist to wind up Fury who has a few screws lose to get an angry reaction out of him. It was well planned by True Geordie and to get his podcast more views.
You were perfectly polite.
I love Tyson but damn I lost a lot of respect for him. I think you handled it perfectly. Good stuff mate.
Well said wor kid , your doing some good work, fury interview was brilliant
He must of been on a comedown.  Disclaimer: I don't want to fight you Tyson you're a great fighter but you still treat people with respect.
U good
You dont even need to justify yourself to the trolls and haters. You are an amazing interviewer and have it in you to ask the right questions. Dont waste your time criticising these oxygen thieves your smashing it.
I love that interview with Tyson  Absolutely legend true Geordie
Top lad Gordy
Massive respect for you bro
Hey Geordie. I know a few people that are promoting the fight and I have been told that they haven’t sold enough tickets and the fight is now going to be postponed till next year. I have been told one of the fighters will come out with a miraculous injury nearer the date, giving them more time to hype and sell the fight. If you don’t believe me come back to this comment in a few weeks.
Gareth Davies is stressed rn 😭😭😭
Clearly dont understand boxing, fury will fight any man he is offered. The promoters and agents deal with the buisness side. to confront a fighter about something he cant control is stupid. This isnt ufc, stop being a karen and let the man do what he does best and fight!
Geordie just hitting them with the facts, fair play man
Brian you were awesome you asked the right questions, I look up to you so much. A idol for being a true man, being respectful and standing up for yourself
Love it 😂 ye mad thing Geordie love from Ireland 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Geordie you a legend. Ignore the clowns how many of your haters or even fans have 2m subs...they're all deserved. Respect.
Great video get rid of the cancer bit though yeah.
This is why you're in my top 5 all time favorite YouTouber's man!
Brilliant!
Well done Brian 👏
Cant stop laughing at the thought of Fury smashing his phone
Communication is not what you said but how? Your interview approach was wrong. Fury was patient enough to wait. He should have ended it early enough and moved on from the start.   I don't condone his  insults, but @TrueGeodie, you have low knowledge of boxing and how to articulate questions, especially to a heavyweight champ. You must respect them!   People may praise you hear but your approach was wrong.   I have watched the interview for over and you have fo listen to your questioning techniques.   Timing is important. He is in camp and gave you his time. You don't do that. You should have done this before camp or after camp. You are not a fighting man to understand this..  The approach may lose use a great audience from boxing greats if you don't learn how to structure interviews. Only boxing casuals will rate your interview approach because they don't understand boxing.
Big respect Geordie 👌👌
Tyson Fury's nose is getting too close to his ahole he thinks his shlt doesn't stick I am a big fan of Fury he is one of the greatest heavyweights of all time but he is becoming annoying and he needs to wind his neck in because he is going to start losing fans.
He knows this fight is a sham he was just embarrassed
Ok so this is the video that made me subscribe
Two big men with two big egos. But fair play to the geordie asking him questions that I've been wondering for a long period of time.  Anytime anyone says any criticism to the Furys they seem to get really offended by it. I like the Furys and think Tyson is the best heavyweight of his era.   Heavyweight boxing has got so many contenders but it's dying with champions fighting once or twice a year and the best not meeting the best.
Pervert loses it at webcam girl when she refuses his sick demands.
Completely agree Geordie, was a massive fan of fury until I saw that interview. Straight away thought he was a prick
I'm a boxing fan for years and the way boxing has gone and this interview has made me subscribe....fair play mush
You pushed it too far. Tyson explained himself 3 or 4 times and this dude kept pushing back even after Tyson pointed out his hypocrisy when he admitted he'd be more excited for 4th fight with Wilder. He was done after that. Checkmate. He should've digressed from there and we could've had a fun rest of the interview.
These bams saying you’re not qualified is hilarious. When I ask someone for directions in the street I don’t expect them to have a degree in geography, just some sort of knowledge. So you can ask whatever the fuck you want.
Just glad people are finally waking up to Fury’s bollox.
Turned him into Ronnie Pickering😂😂
Well done trueG great questions...top man
I will turn up to your address email me it gimp
Was so refreshing to see him get properly questioned on his bs
You are a delight 👏
We love you TG ❤
Come on man. You knew what you were doing and fair play, did it well. But from the start you tried to push his buttons and knee the reaction you'd get from both him and then the public afterwards. At least have the balls to admit it man 😂.  You did it well and knew exactly how that was going to play out from the start and gradually pushing that button the more reaction got back, was text book interview to get a viral vid 😂
Good on you mate glad you came back with this follow up.Tyson came across like a bully and nobody like a bully..Good thing you put him back in his box 📦
Blah blah blah stop it stop telling us how you think tyson thinks , stop hating we can see the hate in your eyes fool.
Talking about Egos while showing a mad ego lol still love ya Geordie keep up the good work, subscribe from me fella
Side note, jesus hes lost so much weight, looking good true geordie
Can't fault you tg  you hit his nerve it showed he knows himself chisora ain't the fight anyone wants, over past few months even with the aj bollocks it's tarnished him in my opinion, if u want 2 b the best in any sport u gotta face the best and chisora is not world class level
Fury is Fury and that's that. Ultimately he's going to do what he wants to do even if it's disrespectful to boxing or its fans.
"I am from Newcastle I have a seventh Dan in pissing people off" hahaha
The fact that he has to explain that is terrible the guy simply asked questions even the veteran boxing ‘fans’ have thought give the bloke a break
Love or hate true geordie you have to respect him 👊🏼
needed this
he was pissed off from the beginning and looked like he was on the gear
Is right lad said it how it is and he didn’t like it
<3
You have no experience of fighting for a living. He deserves more respect imo
So, Deontay Wilder helps get his career back on track and then he puts on a clinic in the second match to behave like this? He should be more civil given where he was with his demons and coming out from their grip.
Class interview big lad. Never back down
Brian handled the whole situation brilliantly and you could tell from the first minute when Tyson said he had to go to the gym that he was on edge about something. About the trilogy thing sure didn't Ali not have two trilogies with Fraizer and Norton.
It's always obvious when a boxer is taking an easy fight as they'll talk up their opponent as a credible challenger. Contrast that with when fury fought the likes of klitshko and wilder and his entire approach to promoting the fight is to talk them down, call them a bum and a dosser and make it out like they're fighting a nobody. Fury has always made grand predictions ahead of proper fights "I'm gunner knock im owt in the sixth round" whereas he isn't saying this about Chisora as he needs to make it sound like an even contest. It's like the equivalent of Man City playing against QPR and Pep desperately promoting it like it's going to be a real battle of two evenly balanced contenders
ok lets get something straight you bald bearded dosser.. you got 10 x more triggered than fury in this video!!!!!  lol
What a response 👏 You are so right man,really enjoy your videos. Great work
Couldn't agree more with you Brian. I'm as big a fan of Tyson as you can find. His mental health journey was a huge inspiration to me to try and over come my own demons. But watching him turn into a big man child all because he didn't like the being told what most boxing fans think of this fight was super disappointing
embarrassing t shirt
Third biography Only one life  Lmfao
Tg is the Goat. Big balls. That was a great and  honest interview. B blessed !
They are literally billing the fight as "never say never". Enough said.
Spot on trueG
Good on you for your views you have right to opinion like everyone else… however I think you was too disrespectful especially saying about his legacy… the guy has beat wilder 3 times the guy with the most vicious right hand who no one would fight but up stepped fury! I just think overall it was a bad interview I mean fury did say a few choice words which I don’t condone but at the same time I feel anyway you could have been a bit more respectful and knowledgeable as I thought you was wrong but look that’s my opinion… I love your podcasts I’ve always watched you but I think you was very poor on this occasion
Brian speaking straight facts. Held himself well throughout. Good job mate.
13:40 correct True Geordie !
Lol you’re a nobody and he definitely isn’t jealous of you 😂. It illustrates two things,  delusion and being a charlatan. Your boxing knowledge is limited to a bunch of YouTubers. We all know the rumours of your sordid and predatory behaviour around young men.  You can label anyone with names who doesn’t agree you. You’re not mates, nor are you chased with the likes of Louis Theroux and other people your name dropping. The only accurate thing you’ve said is you’re making money by using his name. Stick to rubbing up against YouTubers in your sordid and sick way.
You’re the man!! Be proud my man, Walker boy here, you know ❤
I like the "if you have a lot of wars, you're gonna get warn (worn) out"
All good Brother you doing fucking nice job... I'm respect your content and love your bought YouTube channels 👍🥃🥃
Brian you are absolutely right. Good man.
Fury wasn't serious in his rand, I think... Just before he started calling him names, he said "good man", right? And I believe Geordie knows that (why he was laughing) but he is exploiting it very well.
Next video, can you say ‘aaahh Geoff maan!!’. And maybe a ‘SPOOGIE!!’
Huge respect to TG! ❤️
Nobody likes a spotlights on them when they’re taking a dump.
💯🥊💯
You did big man well played and who is going to buy that fight well said and balls to you for it 👍
That is some achievement for an Individual to have 2 million subscribers on You Tube. I have now subscribed to send you on your way to 3 million.
Amazing video, amazing interview and earned the respect of everyone with half a brain
All good except the mention of cancer , that was not good. My opinion, we all have one
Fair play mate, fair play
Well said,your right the Chisora fight didn't excite me either.
I don't understand how ppl most fury fanboys would buy the 2nd never mind the 3rd autobiography as not only is he only halfway through his life as it is so obvious he insults the intelligence of his fans which can't be that high if they buy 3 of furys books which are going to be exactly the same just the wording rearranged, and fury says he respects his fans an is a man of the ppl yet milks them for all he can an yet they just don't seem to see the bigger picture.
Geordie definitely milking this one.
Subbed. We need more people calling our these jackass fighters that refuse to fight the best possible opposition
Mate, you questioned him like a bloke. No pandering to him. I love him as a boxer and you as a YouTuber but you went up in my estimations and I’m down sadly!
This is such a W video
Tyson embarrassed himself. He defintely was having a bad day though, as from the start you could tell he wasn’t happy
Calling Jordan Peterson an 'intellectual' is quite a stretch.
To be fair that was a great rant from a great interview I’m sure you are marmite to some people I’m a single 43 year old father of 4 from wales my two sport loves are liverpool and ufc I for one have gone off the boxing with all the behind the scenes bullshit and fair play for trying i for one have been helped a lot by you through mental illness without you even knowing for that I would like to thank you
Geordie gassed coz he got a few pats on the back for the interview
Fair play Geordie , Fight is a farce. Boycott !
Well said
May your happiness be large and your bills be small.
Well done geordie great questions
Vibratorgate?
I do believe what you said is correct but I do think the way you went about it in this clip made you also sound a bit of a bell 🔔
Amazing amount of subscribers & finally someone just spoke the truth to fury. He used to be a man of the people until he sold out. Total liar these days.
Rare fury L
You better no get to cocky bro your going to end up running into him and he's the number 1 heavyweight in boxing by a country mile and will be surrounded by gypsys
Fury always has been and always will be a nasty piece of work just like his Dad.
Holy 💩, You’re drinking your own Koolaid.  I’m embarrassed for you Peggy
This is True Geordie back to his original best. Shades of the Nile Ranger rant.
Brian the GOAT
HOWEVER I CANT TRUTH BE TOLD say I DIDNT FIND VIDEO FUNNY AS FUCK . but lets not pretend . geordie isnt a dumb bloke . HE WAS GRILLING TYSON LOL .
Absolutely legend 🐐
It was a good interview. There's too many guys on TV who just ask the 'safe' questions.
Handled it with class, made him look like a muppet which he isn’t used to, his ego is massive, love him as a fighter but out of the ring he can fuck off
Fight tommy fury he's a ponce
Good man
It didn't seem to me that Tyson was beaing very serious. That's just how mates talk to each other when they don't agree
My respect for Tyson fury dropped after the interview because of his attitude to TG. Brian did a great job and Tyson made himself so poor.
To think people would rather see tg fight fury as opposed to chisora shows how arrogant and deluded tg now is..
It’s clear and obvious that Tyson was dodging AJ from day one. Great work true Geordie
This is far too bait, think credibility as a boxing critic/fan goes with a video like this. The last one sort of gave you that credibility but this one isn’t it I’m afraid
Good lad TG, holding Fury to account
Skills.  Enjoyable rant, well owned.
He’s human he’s not perfect!! Those who claim to be and accuse others, highlight their faults have demons speaking threw them
Damn have the Usman comments finally stopped? Thang god.
I've got to agree with everything you've just said there! Especially about interviewer's being scared to ask questions incase they dont get another interview!
Fury back on the sniff .
geordie your referred to conner ben towards  tysons past . i watched the video .
Well said 👏
The truth hurts that's all there is to it.
Been a TG fan for years but this has to be up there with one of the best interviews I've seen on YouTube. Keep the amazing work up TG.
Ballsy, I love it Brian!!
The moment Brian said “hey how you doing” Tyson was hostile. He was defensive the entire interview
Totally on your side big fella 👍
Didn’t no you but now I do what a Interview great work hundred percent right about time someone had the balls to pull him up! 👍🏻
Guy bangs on about mental health then runs you down big man keep up the good work mr true G
Brian is so much more likeable without Lawrence sat next to him
Well said, Brian, mate
You got my subscription 🙌  brilliant.
I didn’t call you baldy… baldy
Get wilder on !
Respect brother YNWA
Why would you mess with another mans pay day though? Unless it was immoral, illegal, out right scandalous or whatever? Okay yeah he's taken a few pay day fights, but then on the other hand he's blessed us with some of the greatest fights in recent memory. Like, why isn't he allowed to to pay day fights? Who are you to call that out and say it's wrong? Especially when you're talking about one of the best boxers to come out of Britain. It's like the Eddy Hearn thing, talk about burning bridges, it's a dangerous game to play imo, I respect it to a degree cause it takes balls but there's defo better ways of going about it, life tends to come around in full circles.
Fucking brilliant.. subbed
You've come a long way since your rants about the FCB mate....loved you then, love you more now....well done.
All facts
Has youtube been unsubscribing people from your channel? Just noticed I was unsubscribed but I know I should be subscribed
Im a fan of True Geordie .....and most of the questions asked were good. That said, the interview style was a bit off....I could see why Tyson was pissed off right from the off. No matter what you think of Chisora, the man is a beast and I genuinely believe he would flatten AJ now. In terms of styles, Tyson v Usyk doesnt work for me....Tyson would batter him. I think AJ is shot to bits and Chisora would smash him to pieces so given Usyk couldnt fight this year, who else was there for Tyson to fight? And he needs a fight. Total disrespect of Chisora who is an elite fighter who will give Tyson a better fight than both Usyk and AJ in my opinion. As for Joyce, Id like to see that fight but Tyson would definately win so doesnt want to put that stain on his friends record....rightly or wrongly that's the reality. True Geordie, I love you mate but don't start bad mouthing Fury who will go down in history as one of the most gifted fighters to ever grace the planet. Fury doesnt actually need to fight anyone, he has already done more than anyone in boxing in the last few decades
while i get geordie . he was annoying him over factime lol .THATS WHAT GOT TYSONS BACK UP . He agreed to video call interview for bald tosser to grill him pmsl . both as bad
True Geordie is the certified goat for this
honestly i think the reaction from fury was very unprofessional and disrespectful towards constructive critisism
Legend
7:00 fury disrespected tf out of wilder then got mad wilder ignored him after the fight
Legend big man. A man of integrity. Stay true to yourself and long-term you are the winner.
Fury, knows that you get views and most of us are boxing fans and this is free advertising for this fight and its gone full Ronnie Pickering
Amazing interview Brian, so much respect for you!
cmon my ladd <3
Nobody has to buy the fight don't know why anyone's crying about it
More than fair point
What the heck was wrong with fury
You are the man true geordie we boxing fans love you. You schooled the connman, liar champ.
Here here! Well done mate!
I think people are still in the mindset that YouTube is still an amateur style of content. For years youtube has brushed with elite and professional standards of content and some people can’t handle that every day it moves closer and closer to overtaking the professional sector. The amount of interviews Brian has done and the caliber of interviews have grown every time.
I've been a  boxing fan for about 30 years and I have to say hats off to you. You've earned another subscriber 👍
funny asf how he called you baldy yet you have more hair than him lmao
Lovin all the armchair assassins on here 😆🤣  Fairplay to TG for actually holdin Luke up to rights, pushin him for answers and not playin his meat flute like a LOT of the c*ck-snoggers out there!  Jab back, TG, Jab back!
Respect for standing your ground mate. His not use to that. It was a great interview.
Can't believe I actually thought you were sound. You're just as bad ya clout chasing horrible twat
goat
Brian, love you and the interview was crazy, but to me, Tyson is amazing fighter and for me.his what happened during the interview appeared to be a way of selling the fight and maybe played   into his game! Love yer bro
TG probs wont see this but few points. I love his videos but annoying when he chose conor over khabib 🤣 but he was perfect in his interview, fury was a pr***! TG, quick think my man, all these 'boxers' slating you, atleast you had the cajones to say something straight up big guy! Well done. Never seen a person who has absolutely 100 percent positive feedback!
well said mate
With fury its all about legacy. He can deny it. But your trying to compare with some of greats. What they had in common. They fought all world champions. You dont get that done, furys legacy is a myth. Look at Ali. Liston champion frasier champion when he fought. Foreman champion, he fought them all and new comers. Fury has to do the same. He retires not fighting usyk joshua and  joe joyce, then its a travesty
How are we paying a fortune for this fight its not ppv
Brian's a really good man, and a bald tw-
Haha you uneducated fools. Fact is. Chisora gave Tyson a better effort than Dillian did hahahaha. They trying to build the Dillian AJ fight. Dillian Whyte might have beaten chisora..  but most recently he was made the look like a child against tyson... Dillian got KOd with a push for gods sake. Matchroom casuals. Tyson burns my head out as well.. bur facts are facts. Dillian is a waste man. Chisora is a harder fight.
You should fight him lol
Oh and the interview...... Was greeeeeeat 🤟
Fury is still GK and great video well said
Keep smashing Brian and asking the questions no-one else will ask 😂🙌
Abit below the belt the cancer joke bro
Bang on mate, those who criticised you are all cork suckers and don't have the integrity or self worth to ask the straight questions for fear of not getting that next interview. They are all on the Tyson fury band wagon and fighting for the scraps like vultures from the fury table. Well done wor kid  keep up the good work, Respect 👍
Top man.
Sticking up for yourself V being stuck up yourself is way different.  I fucking loved the interview and your right, keep your distance and take those risky jabs that other ballbag interviewers don't take 🤣👍
You’ve earned a new fan.
Absolutely love how your like yip this video is easy money, honest no bullshit how it should be. Good on you my man. And the fury interview was epic, saw him in a different manner to be honest
You are good at what you do but boxers are different aren't they? You have to stay onside to keep getting interviews.
Brian you started the vid fine. You were witty, composed and talking sense.   You then switched to an aggressive rant, insults and became guilty of the exact same of what you were criticising Fury over in regards calling those who criticised you being "you're a f***ing moron!" and listing off big names you've interviewed that chased after you to be interviewed to prove your worth, and prove how smart you are and prove how stupid they are, outlining what you've achieved compared to them and almost beneath you those critics are...  So I guess just like Tyson saying "well if you don't like it don't watch it!", you're attitude is to tell me the exact same thing?(Not that I criticised you before now)
Geordie.. I've been waiting years for someone to do what you did.  Get in there pal. Gareth Davies and Umar in tears all week. Hahahaha
Fury is a knobhead
Didn't think there would be a true geordie and tyson fury beef at the start of this year
True geordie absolutely folding tyson over, spreading his rectum and inserting his geordie tool into that bum dossers chocolate pipe sack deep. Fury biting down on that bullgag absolutely seething now like a right little bum dosser
Easy money 😂
A True Geordie ...means BEING A TRUE GEORDIE...!!!! Tyson tried to piss down everyone's back and tell us its raining..over a mates retirement pay day, making mugs outta the gullible who are going to pay for the literal sht show its going to be. Well done bonnie lad ...you held his feet to the fire and he got burned...Brian we all know you did a real interview kidda ..not some arse licking PR stunt for Tysons ego.
Fury about to uno reverse Geordie by throwing the Chisora fight
You told him like it is. Lost respect for Fury.. I always rooted for him but it seems hes ducking Usyk. Maybe Usyk beats him. Chisora couldnt beat the local bouncer in a bar of a 500 populated town
Well said
Geordie just speaking facts. Respect 🙏
Not justifying Fury’s response, and TG absolutely asked the right questions, but the interview wasn’t handled well.  Sure, question him about the fight. Don’t even take his first answer- you should challenge him and dig deeper. But you spent literally 15 minutes just repeating the exact same points and exact same criticism, going round in circles to the point anyone would get bored and irritated. Sometimes know when to let a point go if it isn’t going anywhere…
I miss your old content geordie and don’t keep up with you as much these days however that interview with fury and this follow up has been fantastic and has shown the likes of IFL Gareth Davies up and made them look like amateurs I think you should of called out that little rat umar as he seems to be having digs at you trying to tell you how to do a interview which is hilarious 😂 yeah fantastic exposing fury for what he really is 👏🏻👏🏻
Fury starting to act more n more like his father
This fights a massive dissapointment , wouldnt be to botherd if i missed it.
I used to love Fury but let’s be honest he’s turning into a right nob and I couldn’t care anymore about watching him he even had a go at Kugan and it got really heated and really shook Kugan up over nothing
Shouldn't have to defend yourself for asking questions most boxing fans want answering
My advice would be to just pipe down at this point mate, honestly. You are running your mouth with the wrong ones kid.
Get in TG. Spitting straight facts
Tyson Fury won a lot of people over with his heart and his perspective on life. But he has slowly turned into an absolute douchebag and a hypocrite. But because so many people connected with his "working class" roots, and his struggles with depression - it was really hard for some to reconcile with what he's become. I think Geordie did everyone a big favor by exposing it. And if anything, Tyson himself should be thanking him - for not being a yes man and telling him how people really feel about him.  I really hope that Tyson gets his act together because we all know the demons he's struggled with. NO ONE wants to see him go through that phase again. But it's so disappointing and tragic how he's been acting lately, and Geordie just put a spotlight on something that many of us have been feeling, but didn't want to admit it.
We are boycotting the fight Who wins? Who cares!
Wouldn’t even waste the energy on IFL and Gareth Anal Davies. Troughing Fury’s hoop the lot of them
Best interview EVER💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
F the true geordie
Tyson Fury Trigger😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bri ave u gotta a death wish or something! Well it was nice watching your content 😂😂😂😂 fair play for saying what the media are unwilling too 😎👏✌️
That interview has given you worldwide exposure
Don't really care for your Podcast.. But definitely like the Tyson interview
I watched the interview and I thought you done a very good job and asking the right questions. Tyson Fury is a bully and you didn’t get bullied by him. Good for you mate
FLAT EARTHERs next thing you will be saying is that the sun is a corn flake
I remember subbiing to you back when you used to film yourself on an iPhone and now here you are after having all these amazing guests and now holding your own in an interview with Tyson Fury and people have the gall to say you're not qualified.
Very well said TG 👌
talksport suck up to him so hard they could probably suckhim up to the 17th floor of the news building through a curly straw
Anyone else love to be with fury whilst he watches this? Because I don’t even think he can argue with these facts🤣
The interview doesn’t need any justification. It was exactly what needed to be said and exactly what the mainstream media wouldn’t say. You asked the questions every fight fan wanted to be asked and the ones that ifl, behind the gloves talk sport etc wouldn’t! Great job Brian keep it up
Well said mate 👏
Yes Brian! Get them fucking told big man! You always try your fucking best and we love ya mate.
Savagery🤣🤣🤣
Tyson probably wants to go back on Talksport and have Jim White and Simon Jordan kiss his ass 😂😂😂
I fucking love this video.
Calling anyone in the heavyweight division at their level an easy fight is massively disrespectful to them, their opponent and the sport.
Im the biggest Tyson Fury fan but TG is 100% right on this.
LeOOOOOnOOL   Brilliant points made!!!
Why did ppl pay to see ksi fight his fat friend and the skinny none skilled Mexican boy ?
The opening jokes to this were brilliant Brian bang on point 🤣
I said it in the last video but I'll say it again... @IFLTV Kugan and Umar, take note. That is how you put the questions the people want to know the answers to. Try it, instead of just sucking Tyson and Frank off. Well done TG 👏 If you get bored of the podcasts then boxing journalism would be an easy transition for you.
You live your life precariously through others achievements and or failures and just talk about them, don't you think you should be a bit respectful🤔
Who has the biggest "ego "- True Geordie or Tyson Fury - only one bloke deserves that -True Geordie !
Put the phone down if you no how 😂🤣
Well said. All those who tried to make excuses for Fury are the same journalists too afraid to hold his feet to the fire. They're afraid of not getting another interview again. About time someone called Fury out for his BS.
True Tyson fury shows his colours
I absolutely love this. Perspective and narrating reality - there's little more entertaining than the truth.
5:43 “who the hell are you to tell me what I need to be doing?” You’re literally doing the same thing, telling Tyson he needs to fight Usyk.
Tyson "the gypsy hoover" fury ❄️ will be at home throwing furniture around with white powder all over his nostrils absolutely raging at this
Great video brian, tyson finally getting called out for his ballshit
Mate the great British public ain't paying for any fights we've all got iptv 🥊
So how does this effect Leon's legacy
This is why people like AJ.. he may not agree with your view on him but he always respect your opinion and behaves like a champ
Great bit of work from TG.
True Geordie is a legend period
Guy is milking it
TF went right down in my estimations following that interview
Ffs finally someone that understands the fans. How can you not agree
True honest from the heart opinions you cant beat it! - keep on calling them out pal 🙌
No mention of the apparent 60k ticket sales. Tyson is delusional if he thinks they have ended up in boxing fans hands. Most snapped up by ticket agencies to sell on (good luck with that).
your interviews are some of the best in modern day, you helped inspire me to interview people from fields which i am passionate about, keep up the amazing work Brian!
Fury fought wilder chisora and Whyte as his first title defences. All you cry babies talking as if Geordie asked some important difficult questions should get you heads checked. It’s fighting, it don’t pay the bills, if you don’t like the fight don’t pay for it 🙄 snowflakes.
Hatman, blue collar sports,and gman all praised you
I was losing respect for true Georgie for slagging boxers and promoters off on YouTube after being friendly in an interview with them but this has proven he’s real ✊
Because you're so angry about Fury selling his fight on ppv I'm looking forward to you asking your mate Jake Paul the same questions about screwing fans with ppv for his 'boxing' matches
Go on lad
Just pure class as always, can't believe he's ruining his reputation
I'd love to see what you think about AJ
Brilliant top job
Geordie is king! King of the North! Tyson couldn’t handle it!
True Geordie vs Tyson fury slap competition 🔥
Considering Tyson was being a miserable twat before he even said anything, I thought you handled the interview very well lol kept it on track and didnt get into arguments or start acting worried and acting sorry trying to please his ego. The guy acted like a melt from start to finish and it's a shame really as I thought Tyson was someone who carried himself a bit better than that
What happens when someone like true geordie speaks the truth and asks questions on what the fans want to hear and people like tyson fury who are babies with criticism and feel like they are better than everyone just because he owns a belt tyson fury needs to get a grip and fight the people who his fans recommend and want to see I used to be a fan of his but I just feel like he's a scared big fat c***
Knew Tyson was going to be in a crappy mood when started the interview by telling Brian that he has to go to gym I'm 40 minutes. He was always going to have an attitude like that unfortunately
But the tickets for fury vs delboy is sold out
Is this wise😂 what if you run into him one day 🤣
I am a fury fan but Brian made him look like a clown. I am getting sick of Fury's bullshit. Well done for asking the questions the fans want to hear
U tell em pal
talk about trying to milk it
Said everything i thought, cant lie
He's linked to a drug cartel fury no respect to him
If Tyson Fury is NOT willing to be tested, by fighting the very best in the division .. the BIG fights, that bring some "Jeapardy" and danger that the public wants to see.. then I would say he should GIVE UP the belts!! Because he will always have unanswered questions over WHO actually WAS the GOAT 🐐!!!
you legend True Geordie!!!
Honestly I thought he was just joking around at the end of the interview when he was cussing out Brian.
Well done pal
Well done Brian mate you stood up to him you done nothing wrong keep the vids up there amazing 💪🏽👍🏻👍🏻🔥🔥💥
Done well with this one again 👍
Respect 👊🏽
True Geordie is not afraid of him.
Don't worry about the weapons that critique you Brian. You are a top guy and your interview with Tyson was not only Top Quality content but it shined a light on questions that some pussy ass journalists would be afraid to ask. Mental how it took for one interview to achieve what some journalists have been trying to achieve their entire careers. I'd buy you a drink if we ever met 😅
Tyson fury’s a champion but that’s not an attitude of a champion
Badass True Geordie. Been there since the bomb shelter days💪🏻
The saddest part for me was comparing the first interview Brian did eith Tyson to this one. In the first one there was a mutual sense kf respect between both
You gained respect he lost some love the way you kept composure and as a paying customer you have the right and the balls to ask what many wouldn't well done
Fair play
WELL DONE FOR TAKING ON THE CON ARTIST FURY
Well said mate🇦🇺
Don’t explain yourself so much, u did your thing relax a bit
Well done Geordie, great interview.  Tyson just wants to cherry pick his way to greatness 😆 Not my era, He was too scared to mention Usyk name like USYK is a fighter who wasn’t born yet .
Ifl have their head up furys backside, fair play TG said what most boxing people were thinking
Very bizarre comments made in this video
Yesss the big lad
Geordie you did a good job and handled it well... For Tyson Fury he is triggered and  to echo Rick James words: "Cocaine is  a hell of a drug" dude is back on it. Compare Tyson's demeanor to Conor Mcgregor's during the build up fight against Khabib. They are both the same and Conor was on it (allegedly)
TG you are NUMBER 1 interviewer. Please don't change. You have earn the people respect.
probably the best boxing interview ive ever seen
Now u can respect how aj takes alll the tough fights
Fair play Brian, spoke eloquently and true, you are the True Geordie.
Usyk is older than fury
Have always been a fan of Tyson fury but in this case he was out of order and spoke down to Brian from the get go of interview.  You might be brilliant at boxing but Ur a human being like everyone else
Handled it well, good on you. Made him look a clown.
Tyson is the man of the people!! He's just not a man to sit and listen to innocent boys like yourself! 😂 😂
Passion
SPOT ON!❤️
How dare you question why he couldn't fight ruiz,ortiz,bakole,hunter,hrgovic,Dubois,sanchez,makhmudov,the cheek!!!!
Fuckin spot on mate this video was so perfect for a response to all the little winnets hanging out of Tyson’s arse hole. Big up TG❤️
True geordie your the peoples champ you say what is on everyone’s mind and aren’t afraid to say it absolute legend love your content thank you 🙏
Geordie is a GOAT 🐐 ❤
Naaa mate don't put yourself down brother! You can see form the start Tyson was not into the interview with the comment "you have to make it quick because 14min Gim session".
Loved your journey TG, well done for saying true to yourself and authentic even when interviewing the big dogs
Water off a ducks bollock
Funny how he's criticising Tyson for exactly what he's doing in this video
Loved the interview TG the best i have seen in years!
Can't say fairer than that. Tbh, I think you came across very well. You're right - I wish all journalists had those balls.
Good video. I don’t blame you making this video for a pay day though 😂😂
Hoe much did Eddie pay you ?
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏Bravo!! 🤣
Big man making jokes about tyson online in the safety of your gafe u big potato! 😂 😂... I always thought it is hilarious u talking about boxing and mma when u literally been in 1 fight in your whole life! Lol if even!!! 😂 😂 😂 💀... Tyson called u out on it 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻... You be better giving your opinion on subjects u know about like weights or eating or being an innocent boy! Leave the opinions about fighting to people who actually can fight and have also been in real fights u nob-jocky
This video is even better than the interview! Tyson is a walking contradiction and you've called him out on it 👍👍👍 it's always about money and legacy, always.
beg
👏 👏 👏 well said!
he is back on the sniff
Just putting it straight… you are good bud but not on mr rogans levels
Tg is an og he had balls to do that 😂
I thought you did well , you’re a good interviewer. Tyson showed himself up , obviously got out the wrong side of the bed that day 😂
Fair play for asking the questions we were all thinking.
You could see Tyson was pissed even before the interview started
Absolutely Brilliant come back this after all the coverage your interview got, take a bow Brian 👏👊👍
The  best part  about it  was   Geordie  said  it all as a Tyson Fury'  fan        fury  still found  a way  To make  himself look  like a  DOSSER    he ain't  got respect  for boxing  He just  Cares about  the money 💩🏠
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Your brilliant mate 😂👍
Respect your honesty.
Tyson is just after money and pushing agendas .. and his  mental illness comes from not feeling good enough from childhood..
You saved boxing   to an extant
I love every interview. Logical and intelligent
2:38  Tyson doesn't care about legacy. (So is named after Mike Tyson).😄
Brilliant! Kindest regards, Richard U.K
Dunno why you're acting all tough. You wouldnt say any of this to his face. He would beat you to a pulp if he saw you but I guess ego makes us arrogant and stupid.
Top man
just nailed it
Well fuckin said, stand your ground Geordie!
I’d like to see you press AJ with tough questions
you did good job
very tru
Can't fault anything you've said here Geordie. Agree with it all... and you got a viral clip out of it congrats
True Geordie the type of bloke to start a fight then phone the police when he gets beat up 🤣🤣🤣🤣
your an absolute ego monster bring your self back down to earth wayyy to big for your boots you can’t talk about tyson’s ego when yours is through the fucking roof you are an annoying prick you’ll never read this but if you do you’ll probably be thinking well don’t watch my videos
As a young geordie lad brian mate from elswick knowing your story deep sea diving and how well u have done for yourself should  be proud mate just a rough and ready down to earth geordie lad who done well for himself ignore the hate brian mate well done
You was tounge punching his fart box when he was on ya podcast , leave him be
Geordie doing standup?¿ 🤔
He’s literally calling out the whole of IFL tv, Kugan, Umar etc.  TG bang on the money
Great stuff TG!!
This whole thing has bought the best out of you mate. Keep it up 👍🥊
I have been waiting weeks for some one with big balls to ask him these very questions .Thank you .At last someone with real guts and not a pleaser .
Yom fuckin class mate 👊👊👊
Love you Brian keep up the amazing work
You vs Fury would be worth a shot surely? Imagine becoming heavyweight champion 😄
it was a brilliant interview Fury got exposed
No justification needed.  You bossed.
Let’s face it Fury is a bit of a prick. Thinks himself as cleaver and witty. He is anything but.
Go for it lad! Much respect! Keep on keeping on brother!
tyson fury has a energy drink
• I recently saw a clip of Fury being interviewed impromptu and he was high as a kite (cocaine or something).  It was a bummer to watch.  Hopefully he'll rest in grace and ride these recent compulsions & mistakes out in kind.   • Misc:  I expect he will own this meltdown sooner than later, and move forward recognizing that he had no control at the time...   • I have a heart for Fury, he is an embattled soul with unimaginable levels of temptation and millions of eyes on him to boot... • He's one of the greatest fighters of all time, and I will continue to root for him whether he ever laces em up again or not. • I hope Tyson isn't continuing to fight to fulfill some spiritual agreement he previously made with insideous types behind the scenes.  If so, hopefully the Chisora fight is his last payment due to them.
Simon jordan asked him the same questions, even more thorough and investigative aswell and fury answered them fine, its thw annoying goading way you asked them
You bald t*sser
Put some respect on Brian’s name !!!!
Geordie cashin in
Hit the nail on the head with this one mate fuck everyone else. people that can’t see that are brain dead mate you did what the people wanted he just made himself look terrible there mate x
Good man Brian , well said, funny man , well in your rights
Passive aggressive interviewer who dildos his own arse slags off Tyson? Not your brain cells mate so why  you care.
Why haven’t you covered the jake Paul vs Anderson fight? Usually you live stream it
7:40 I'm actually crying ahaha
top response
You should try and do this with other world class sports athletes in their class? But you’re a big fan of boxing, this is your sport, so makes sense you’d pick a champion heavy weight of the era. What a moment and opportunity you’ve had .. historic really!
Fair play TG 😊
Best part of this is the dig at the journos in the sport.  Good man!  -T.Fury
More people need to be held account like this tg! Get some political guests on and give them the tg treatment!
I couldn't watch after this guy said he's not interested in a fight with Fury, like who the F** are you ?? getting hype off of other peoples shoulders and making videos. That's the epitome of a loser even if you end up making a lot of money. These days a decent girl can show her monkey and get money doesn't mean she has any value.
Outstanding work... 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
TMZ tomorrow "Tyson Fury calls out YouTuber for YouTube boxing match" 🤣🤣🤣 but seriously Brian lad you keep doing you! The geordie king swept the floor with the gypsy King
Why dont u interview tommy robinson?? Sponsors dont like it hey.... bottle job. Thinking of ya pocket rather than actual free speech. Puppet
I’d piss myself laughing if Chisora won. I know it won’t happen.
My man True Geordie fair play for putting your neck out there. You said what we we’re all thinking
Mr Steam Locomotive, please don't be in the same city as Mr Fury from this point onwards.
Fury won't be fighting AJ or any difficult opponents, egoistic beyond belief. He's no way near the top 10 heavyweights never mind the goat.
Well in lad 😂💪🏻
Amazing mate 💪💪💪💪👍
When he said "good man" he touched his phone. I think he thought he had hung up when he started letting out his real thoughts but then realised he hadn't when you laughed.
Fury was hostile from the start whilst you was being as respectful as possible. He was 100% in the wrong
True geordie biggest muppet about
Truth bombs throughout from TG
You baiting him into that interview. You wont get one again, enjoy the one off payday from The stream
Funny someone pointing out things for years and we can see it.. he's turning into Khan with his delusion he was like this
Ha ha well said mate . There idoits out there . My take on the interview Tyson . Already looked mad B4 ANZ questions .
Absolutely correct.  Fury is a fuckin diva mate and he always has been. Good boxer but become a nob
I suppose it’s true , never meet your hero . I wouldn’t get downhearted with it you did the best you could. It appears his mask slipped after strangely he champions mental health but then goes to personally attack your looks. You suit a bald head 👍.
TG absolutely killed it in this response. Anyone who doesn’t understand where he’s coming from will never understand what it means to stand up for yourself
Lets not forget a overweight  and not on it like he is now chisora got proper robbed by helenious.   Wilders just slept him n apparently Wilders back etc etc . Its fucking bollocks. Leave fury be , judge him on his not opponent
Bro, imagine if Fury somehow loses and then he's like "see, I told you!"
Nice to see some proper journalism (as opposed to straight up arse kissing) from a boxing channel. Consider me subscribed 👍🏻
Well said
Come on all but 5-4 Tyson fights been against bums an cans like tommys record 🤣 an Tyson got no demons he just went on one then used that excuse not too get banned when he got popped for steroids
That interview proved you are  100%  Real    not controled
Was TG in this video? Couldn't see behind THOSE MASSIVE BOLLOCKS!
Yeah Fury vs Chisora is not the fight anyone wants, but the fights everyone wants were not made, and Fury wanted both Usyk and Joshua, it's just not a great time for the heavyweight division, next year it will get better I hope.
Everyone thinks theyre ripping into Fury by criticizing this fight. But all theyre doing is denigrating Chisora.  The casual and seemingly unconscious disrespect shown towards Chisora in this is disgusting. Take a second to think about it...
Fair play to you. And tbh I've seen so many other outlets acting as if Chisora is the only possible person he could of fought lmao. Spineless the lot of them.  My only criticism of the interview is not necessarily the questions or the order. It's more that you never addressed tysons very clear foul mood and attitude. Now don't get me wrong he's the fucking heavyweight champ and an intimidating alpha male. But was clear at least to me he had a problem with you. And that problem was over your critique of the upcoming fight.   I'm no interviewer so could be fucking miles off. But you could of just said stopped and said do you have an issue would you like to have it out? And discuss it? That may of gone very poorly ill admit. But would of saved all of the none answers he gave to your first bunch of questions.
PleaSe everyone screanshot this fury will take a dive to make this fight interesting and try a justify this fight. Wilder and chisora have different power so just wait and see.
Geordie gets rattled way too much man.
True Geordie 🐐🐐
Tyson Fights with his fists and True Geordie fights with his mouth and you guys back this man 😂 How is this real life 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Glad to see people showing Geordie the respect he deserves. Speaks facts and asks for the truth.
better see no haters after this one
Reaction even better than the interview. Hilarious
Grrrr Please stop these out of context statements. AJ and his team have a history of dragging on negotiations when they have 0 intention of making the fight. How do you deal with that team? You give them a deadline. While Chisora is a yes or no man. Ie balls. For picking Chisora, who else except Joe Joyce will cause real problems for Fury? People for years had Whyte has a proper challenge and we saw what happened. Fury losing his temper, only shows the character that made him achieve what he did.
Where the hell is true news
Pure comedy 😂😂😂😂 Tyson punching the air rn
Totally agreed. I like to see the passion about the topic.  Well fucking said!
It’s because Brian Tyson couldn’t out do you and you nailed him and called him out
Love u mate cheers
I thought it was a joke 😂
Don’t mind these clout chasers Brian. Keep doing you, there’s no one like you on YouTube and twitch. We need it, you don’t realise the impact you have on a lot of us because you’re so down to earth but trust me, it means a lot. ❤
You called him out... Back in the 80's and 90' the Heavyweights fought all that were out there, Now they pic and choose! If Tyson REALLY wanted to fight AJ he would of worked something out to get the fight on... Bottomline!
He was named Luke
Lets judge on next fight , please 🙏
Ehhhh
Tryna seep every view out of the situation how do you react to a interview you literally did 🤡
The interview has completely changed my opinion on Fury. Well done Geordie for standing up on your end, I am a Tyson Fury fan but this was completely unnacceptable and just wasn't called for at all. I hope he learns from the back lash from this.
I love true geordie, he's always having youtube boxing's back
Dubois is on the bill, yet Fury is fighting Chisora.  At least that would have been something new.
I seriously think Fury is back on a bad path, and he is making the fight with Chisora as a strategy to try say clean and healthy minded. I’ve seen an interview on YouTube shorts where he looks absolutely off his bean and the fact he was really irritable with you shows he may be back in a bad place. Just a thought
TYSON FURY put a deadline with AJ fight because his drug cycle was wearing off.
TG best in the game.
Geordie is the BMF of journalists
Yes Geordie. You're absolutely right. You are the GOAT
Brian, from what I saw, literally everyone supported you in the comments after that interview. I didn't see a negative one against you. But you blew up in this video talking about the people who talked negatively about you from said interview. Stop focussing on what they say and focus on the positive that so many thought out of that interview.
Tbf, no-one is being forced to watch the fight. We want him v Usyck, but that's not happening just yet, so just ignore the Chissy fight.
Regarding the first to complete two trilogies, Fury means being the first to *successfully* complete two trilogies as winner
True geordie vs Tyson fury bald on bald crime book it
Most of sports have people who have high school level education, people with unfortunate backgrounds that use sports as an exit of their situation. People need to stop admiring this guy's and just be entertained by them.
I'm soo glad the fury bum train is falling apart. He's a fake. He's a drug cheat who got caught and blamed everything on mental health whilst slagging everyone off for no reason. Best ability fakest personality in boxing
Your point about been successful at one thing doesnt make you better than other people was great and i think alot of celebrities need to hear that when they think they are better than us ‘normal civilians’ 🙌🏼
lol, your right but i wouldnt have had the nads to upload this video,
First minute was so funny man haha
Spot on
I like Geordie but he does let comments get under his skin.
That was even better than the interview lad
Inspiration. thanks fuck the youth are getting exposed to such a real genuine person included myself. Continue shining ✨
This guy needs a smack
YOU DONT WANT TO WATCH THE FIGHT , SPEAK FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR DUMB FOE WHO THINK LIKE YOU . AND DONT WATCH ANY FUTURE FIGHTS WITH FURY AGAIN > END OF
Well, you've got a new follower in me. 👍🏻
TG don't worry, your subscribers have got your back!.. and you'll be here long after Tyson Fury has retired and gone off into the sunset.
If you knew someone with well documented mental health problems was getting wound up why didn't you have some empathy  for someone  that was clearly struggling.  You were pressing him when  it was obvious  he wasn't doing great , yes a good journalist  has  to ask the right questions  but they also have to realise  when some one is suffering  and you end in a car crash situation.  I mean would you have pressed it so hard if he was sat across the table no you wouldn't you would have realised something  was wrong. And it's easy giving it the big un when the guys not in the room yes Tyson didn't respond well but for God's sake learn to read the body language of someone he didn't want to be there  the whole interview
Well done for speaking up and standing your ground. You just earned thousands of new fans in the process
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
IFL is shorthand for Irrelevant (if you’re a bit sloppy with acronyms). Thanks Brian. Called out what needed to be said. Pro Boxing is becoming IFL.. Do the Math..
I don't think Brian realizes why he's such a good interviewer. He's genuinely intelligent but also has a lot of life experience.... His appearance, accent and everything make a lot of these guys completely underestimate him.... When they realize what they actually facing they get agitated. Still don't like the other broke though..
True G sub and view count 2x because he's stuck to his opinion and asked the questions he's wanted. Media is moving on. Well done sir 👏👏👏👏
STOP joking about having cancer man!!!!
YOU FOOL! YOU WAS THE ONE  THAT SAW NO APPEAL FOR A 3rd WILDER AND FURY FIGHT BECAUSE TYSON WINS 10 OUT OF 10. SO WHY YOU GOING IN ON A FURY FIGHT WITH CHISORA? BE GRATEFUL.... AND ENJOY YOUR CHRISTMAS YOU CLOWN
True Geordie has some lethal journalistic integrity. Do the same with politicians lmao
I’ll be SO SCARED if I was True Geordie. Imagine seeing Fury in person 😂😂
can see both sides of the coin here, you're jeopardising tyson's pay per view potential by encouraging the idea that the fight won't be entertaining thus angering him, however you have every right to question him as a sports fan about his fights (its an interview). Tyson gave indignation and rude comments when it completely was not necessary. Tyson may be afraid to admit he is doing this to stay in the spotlight and potentially fix some ring rust. no hate or anything btw lol
Keep smashing these interviews ya big bold cunt, we love ya!
Big Brian doesn't shy away from topics that can make his guests uncomfortable or, in Tyson's case, completely livid.  Keep it up!
Way better than any ‘boxing journalist’.. you don’t need to justify yourself to people who are levels below in the same trade !
The sooner fury retires the better.  Fights once a year and its always the fight nobody wants to see.  He fought klitchsko in 2015, klitchsko was long past his best. Then ran from the rematch, then he gets banned for drugs.  Comes back, spends 3 years fighting wilder. Then retires. Now he's fighting chisora 😂 He's a joke
Superb response TG. Your only crime was putting these other (so called) boxing journalist to shame.
Why does it have to be December 3rd? Same doctor as Connor benn? Geordie insinuating Fury has come off his cycle and needs to fight within that specific time? Hmmmm
Lmao i was gonna comment you really milking this situation but fair play I would too
True Geordie I believe that Fury is a chicken burger
Top man Brian. Forget the haters, ignore the fan boys. But rich IFL fan boys and naff promoters suggesting you aren’t worthy to interview a boxer who couldn’t keep it together for ten mins is ludicrous. The people who does this for a living are scared of not getting interviews again….
You know it's a weak match up when Fury has to fight for the honor of his opponent. Most fighters talk down their opposition.
I’ve read both; It was first British heavyweight to complete 2 trilogies  And “first heavyweight champion to complete 2 trilogies”
Respect to u geordie for not backing down love the interviews I was dying laughing at the end of the last one 🤣
Respect 🐐
Like so many boxing fans, gone right off Fury over the last year or so. Was very entertaining to watch TG put Tyson in his place, and wind him up in the process.
"True Geordie calls boxers idiots in viral online rant"
Tbf aj called out fruy fury called out aj simple they interviews to watch
I know a lot of people back Brian but I think his interview was short sighted. He probed and probed on something Fury had already answered to him and if we're being honest you have to understand that he's still got to promote his fight. Like 70% of the interview was asking the same question that Fury answered a number of ways.
Ffs the world is gone soft
So Tyson came back from retirement to fight Chizora? Really?  BS...
Fury just wants to be active ! And chisora got the balls
Umar's interview with Gareth Davies (iFL TV) about this was fu*cking disgraceful.   Fury ring-lickers the both of them.
Are people only just starting to realise how much of an attention seeking spanner Tyson Fury is?
In truth - and charismatic star though he undoubtedly is - Fury displays a worrying degree of anxiety mania and neurosis. It's not rocket science to observe that he clearly has a dual nature, being both very brave but also a very fragile individual constantly living on the edge. As such he has chin of stone and an ego of glass. I would worry for him once his boxing career is finally over. Very funny end to the interview by the way. But of course he wouldn't have reacted in that way unless you had touched a raw nerve of truth. 😎
Was good content to be fair always helped by genuine disagreement/animosity. Now go celebrate by putting a carrot up your backside 😂
Respect mate you showed big balls mate fuck em there a bunch of wanabies cock suckers
This is quality 💪💪💪
Klitschko just a 1 2 got nothing  Wilder big stiff idiot  Whyte dosser  Chisora formidable opponent
TG handled this so well that his comment section went back to normal
Spot on.
That was a terrible interview
Much love and respect to you man, keep it up 💯
Haha this is fucking brilliant. Fury over Brian in boxing, but, a logical argument? No fucking chance! Go on Geordie! X
TG speaks facts fuck Tyson fury he’s a walking contradiction,it’s not about money then mentions money it’s not about legacy then mentions legacy,uysk is not on my level then avoids uysk, aj isn’t willing to fight me then sets a 10 day dead line for the biggest fight in history,he’s not a good champion how many of the top ten boxers has he fought?
It'd the best fight out there for him at this point! At such short notice!
Seemed as if Tyson was in a bad mood from the get go. TG caught him on the wrong day and got him to slip up on how he actually is.
I miss this True Geordie
You're a bellend 😂just like fury 🙄
He'll spank Chisora, destroy his full legacy with some horrific post fight interviews and then retire. He's cashed in so who does he need to impress now? At this point I'd imagine fury will be want to be left alone and this is a great way to isolate and reduce an overwhelming fan base.  Cancer joke is a bit wank mind, boring actually.
If you don't wanna watch don't eatch
I hope you bump into Tyson ,his bothers and dad john . Hope that gets caught on camera . Won’t be so cocky geordie then lmao 😂
i worked with you . tiny balls 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Legend Brian ❤
Oh Brian mate, you didn't need to say anything off the back of that interview. You handled it well, don't get pissed off now post interview. He showed himself up for what he is, you don't need to bang a final nail in the coffin. In a KO you just move on, no more to say pal.
100% correct to many you tubers kissing these boxers arses .
Ronnie Pickering 😂
Thanks Brian for being a true geordie and fuck the arse bandit fury bend overs
The important question is:  When's the podcast with The People's Uncle, Chael P. Sonnen?
I don't mean to offend you, but you sound Welsh to me.
keep doing what you are doing, you are right,!!!  Keep growing your balls....
You sit in front of a microphone for a living .fury gets in to a boxing ring and fights to put food on the table
Legend
It's about time someone asked the questions the majority of boxing fans want to see 👏  IFL/Boxing Social/Talk Sport etc all pander and stroke ego whilst TG is a fan and interviews as a fan. Fair play mate it's about time someone called him out on his bullshit 👍
Great what you did but fuck the cancer jokes off just not funny
Keep doing what you’re doing True Geordie.
ur bald
One things you’re wrong about- Derek is far better now than he was then but is still gonna get slaughtered
Mad to think Brian never had a pro mma /boxing fight in his life . Yet be the best analysis out there on both
You spoke the truth aj vs fury is the only fight in British boxing as a Brit we need to know who’s the best of Britain
Keep it real mate and stay humble!
TG, you are my favourite YouTuber, honestly mate, you're like one of my mates 🤣🍻 cheers brah
I liked the first interview there was nothing wrong with it but this was over the top and not needed.
Spot on here Geordie.  U hit the nail on the head
I've been watching brian for a while and I'm glad people can see that hes a great interviewer and someone that's true to his word
He was just annoyed half of the interview you was asking about other fighters. He's a busy man and you're a busy man I'm sure he thought it should of been more about him and you.... You're both hero's and I hope you see this eventually as disrespect. You're calling a legend make it all about the legend.... If I interview you I won't ask you about shaun attwood or other YouTubers. I make it about you brother
Spot on my friend.. im a fury fan..but u are right on every point ..and fury came across as a bully...
proper milking this lol
Get in there geordie keep up the good work mate
Clout tail piece
If Tyson just came out and said “I need to fight on this date, nobody else was available” it would have been good enough. He’s earned it. He’s beaten wilder and his top contender Whyte and having pursued AJ he’s still entitled to a gimmie.
geordie boss
🤣🤣🤣💯👊🏾 an you did better than ifltv
To be fair I reckon you were spot on and you could tell tyson knows it with how twitchy he was getting with his body language. He wasn't comfortable as he knew you were right and didn't like it.
Used to like fury a lot, respect Gordie so much for not backing down to him!
Tyson is a bully that loves gaslighting people, of course he has yes men around him. when your bipolar af, people around u automatically walk on eggshells not to set it off. AND RIGHT, his "just" the King in Boxing, not every fkn thing else in life. i lost a lot of respect for Tyson, his become the biggest hypocrite. King Hypocrite is his new name. ALSO, I'd bet my paycheck his cokin it up as well.
Balls of Steel, Legend.
Much love bro, you don't need to keep trying, you DO. Tyson and chisora pay day. End of, complete waste of time and money
If you weren’t a household name before. You are now brother
Furys bit of a dickhead icl
Well said big lad 👏👍
Just saying I’ve only got 40 minutes 😂
Jesus Brian, I like this channel. But I don't know how entertaining you gonna be when you can't move. May God protec you 🤣
Tysons job for this fight with chisora will not be to just dominate, it will be to forcefully prove people wrong by maybe dragging out the fight longer and possibly feigning a knockdown, obviously he will get hit by chisora at times even though the huge differences in level chisora will still hit him and he will use this to fake a knockdown, and be all like “see? He was worthy all you lot know nothing” if I was a betting man I’d bet Tyson fury to be knocked down and win in rounds 9-12 that will be his plan, coz if he just performs his best and chisora gets no vital shots on fury and stopped inside 6 then everyone’s opinion on the fight will be proved correct and the dislike for fury will be just, so for that reason I think it will be fury’s job to make chisora look good while still getting a stoppage victory and for that I say fury to be knocked down and win 9-12, maybe 7-12 to be safe but yeah, he has a job to prove people wrong he benefits more by making chisora looking good than himself looking good
Did like true Geordie until now..
💯 there were things needed  saying and you said them mate. Made him look like a Egotistical Dimlo
TG with a great breakdown of the interview & exposing Tysons bullshit. TG BRASS BALLS 💪 Congrats on the 2 million subs. You thoroughly deserve it!
I agree with you but don't add Jordan Peterson to your resume.
I'm not even a fan of True Geordie but he's spot on when it comes to Fury the fella is a pure bluffer
Amen Geordie - well bloody said
Lol this is vintage True Geordie
I just don’t think I can take you seriously anymore after you revealed you like girls to dump on you
Spot on!  LEGEND 👏
Im just wishing someone brings up the clip where Tyson says on the TG podcast that it's not worth fighting Andy Ruiz because he's just like Chisora and how, with Chisora, he was able to close his eyes and win easily
The "Not in my Era" comment Fury made absolutely no sense to me...  imagine Klitschko choosing to not fight Fury or AJ because they were "Not in his Era"
@True Geordie Gone back to your roots with this video👍, I wonder if he used his iPhone and ironing board to record it 🤔😂
You tell em gee 👏 💯 % facts
You held Tyson to account, and you did it with class, Brian.
Tyson was likable during his comeback and Wilder fights but not now. I wouldn't even follow him into battle if it was the end of the world. Tyson probably in a massive grump cause he's signed up to a fight that finicially will make peanuts !
Tyson had a point his 10 of men like you
What it is, people want the truth but they don’t like it when the truth is handed to them point blank 🤷🏻‍♂️  Is a crazy f@ckin world we live in. I say fairplay to ya for stickin to your guns big man.
If I want to see sequels and trilogies I'll go to the cinema. I can tell you that 9 times outta 10 they're never better than the original anyway. Beat a man, move on, it's not Hollywood. Boxings already becoming as laughable as Wrestling and doesn't seem to care what fans want to see. Fans finance boxing, people forget that. Arguably the same goes for football. True Geordie, keep being true to us, yourself and whatever clown is trying to tell you otherwise. It's all about the kerching-a-ching! Peace!
To see where you were a few years ago (mental/physical health) and where you are now and how you handle negativity, whether it comes from comments or Tyson Fookin' Fury, it truly makes me proud to be a fan. I am inspired by your growth and I think anyone with half a brain should be too.
Tyson did have his head up his ass from the start.
Spot on! We’ll played
I don't think I've commented on a yt video before but this is one of the best video's I've ever watched you sir fucking nailed this 👏
You made valid points, when people reply with anger, they have merely validated  your points.
Once again it's a common case that we put Sports people on a podium and that's it they're god. They're average people usually with low intelligence as they devoted themselves to it
True story mate , interview was on point , this vid too , you were spot on in both
Brian told Fury exactly what he needed to hear. And Fury showed himself in a very bad light.
Fury is a great fighter but we need more interviewers like you you’re not scared to ask the questions that all the other pussy ass interviewers are much respect bro 💯
Mate you're winding your sen up. Fuck the haters, don't let them get to you. You're a normal relatable guy with intellect and personality who asks the questions we want
Your a legend Brian!
Great to have the Someone ask and say what everyone is thinking.  Also interesting to see the public facade/mask slip and we see the real person
As a Fury fan it's obvious Fury's mood was off from the get go. Credit to you Brian for asking the hard questions on behalf of the boxing public. I'm sure Fury knows he didn't represent himself as good as he should have, he came across as prickly, fragile to the slightest critique and quick to anger.
According to Tyson, Christian Hammer and Klitschko were his era lmao and steve cunningham
TG your a real don, Respect for just saying it how it is, If people don't like  it then that's their problem👍
I think you might be pushing it.
TG is a legend, brilliant interviewer and asks what fans want and isn’t afraid to do so! 👏👏👌
The whole world has become wimps! Nice to see someone holding people to a standard and not just yes men around them all the time!
Brian great response, but i have to say I'm mad you didn't mention brodie tv when naming the heavyweight intellectuals
Bravo bravo you tell it as it is I like it 👊
Well said 👏
Top man
Fury-'you bald dosser' Geordie- 'I've got cancer, thanks alot' Imagine hahaha savage
I wonder if Daniel thinks Geordie is taking a liberty?.
What happens if chisora gets the first round knock out 😂
The way he turned on a big fan for simply questioning why furys expecting people to give his mate a payday showed his true colours...
You make a joke about how you'd be a bigger draw as an opponent than Chisora, but then immediately say you want no part of it? Then why make that comment? As big as you are, you'd fold if you barely get touched. You need a Nate Diaz slap
Put some respect on his fucking name. True Geordie is a G!
i work offshore and mate its so true😂😂😂everyone winds eachother up
Been waiting for years for someone to have the balls to ask fury this, if every journalist had the same balls to do this with our government and hold them accountable for there actions, maybe we wouldn’t be in this fucking crisis we are in now. Well done, hats off, keep up the good work 👏
Brilliant.... Fair play Brian. The truth......thats all.

The whole closing exchange was just golden. Funniest thing I've seen online this whole year 😂😂
Someone had to tell Tyson at some point 🍻
🐐
Hit on a good point about other people too scared to ask questions from fear of been blacklisted mate 👍👌 I'd say your interview is far more positively viewed by the fans as a whole and that's all that matters .
fuckin faaacccttsss🤝🏻
Fury is a clown now .
Spot on TG. You did nothing wrong in the interview and your response is equally as good. Keep punching.
A part of me really wants fury to lose
You the man Geordie!!!!
Fair play, Brian. Good breakdown of the interview and also some of the muppets having a pop at you since then! We all know who you mean.....
Perfectly said
Thanks for 2 million subscribers 💙
I don't get why you're trying to go at him so much..  just look like an idiot
So much credit to you mate. Finally someone raising and asking the questions everyone wants answers too. Shame a person who claims to have mental health issues speak to someone like that. Laughable. Keep up the great work my man 💪🏼
Brian, you are a fucking king brother, I respect so much that you aren’t backing down, in a cesspool of a platform full of spineless cowards, you are clearly one of the real ones ♥️
facts straight facts.
I love Tyson as a fighter, but like TG said the way Tyson started the interview, dis interested, agitated, and then he’s just unable to take any form of criticism. “The peoples champ” doesn’t seem so much for the people.
Provoking a reaction out of Tyson Fury for attention on youtube. You're a very sad man TG.
Fight sells no more than 100k ppv
I love watching true Geordie , he has worked so hard to get in the position he's in and I agree with pretty much everything he says. I also love the fact he doesn't give a fuck . Keep it up @Truegeordie
❤️👊🏾
Massive props you have the balls to say what IFL don't. You Sir are a proper interviewer
Wow let’s goooo respect brotha
You need to teach other journalists because no one has the balls to question a lot of things, especially governments but i reckon you would
I love it the more I watch it. Let's be honest, the average person gets pulled up on multiple things EVERY DAY. If we all reacted like that, there would be P45s floating around the whole of the UK.EVERYBODY was thinking the same thing, you asked it @truegeordie and it was respected by 99.99% of the viewers.
Hopefully Tyson offers an apology as he made himself look like a complete pillock.
The definition of a True Geordie
I have a feeling this isn’t the end of all this😅
A True Geordie for real
the upload we've all been waiting for 🙏🏼
Reacting to your roasting? You seem like someone who really loves the smell of his own farts. The ultimate narcissist. No wonder a respectful humble man like Tyson Fury thinks you're a weak little ho.
GIVE RESPECT TO THE YB. BIG UP YB
Fair play 👌🏼
And tbh TG, with a bit of training, i reckon you'd beat Chisora lol
He needs to fight Joyce, AJ and Usyk to even be in the 🐐 convo. Respect for asking him the questions everyone in the mainstream media were too shook to ask him.
This was better than the first vid🙏 Any sane human being will be of the same mindset and just glad someone with a platform speaks what we all want to say 🙏
Offering to suck another mans jizz out of you girls asre, I'm outta here simp.
“I’ve won the “Ring heavyweight title twice. Who else do I stand beside?  I’m on a quest for greatness – not f***ing mediocre!  I vacated The Ring title and I’ll now become a three-time Ring champion.  I’m here to do well. I’m not here to be mediocre. Ali stands on his own with those three Ring Magazine belts and I’ll equal that when I get the middleweight (Usyk) in the ring.” - Tyson Fury
I thought this was an Apology video I guess not 😂😂😂😂
Ha ha...Loved the interview and this reaction. Been a long time since i saw a good TG rant since Mike Ashley left us alone :D Tyson was not in a good place from the start of the interview. He's winding down now and putting cash in his families piggy bank...Cant blame him for that. But it is not a good match up, and billing it as a big fight is just wrong...Its just a money boosted exhibition fight.
Put the phone down 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love your work, I thought your questioning of Tyson was entirely fair..  I don’t like the way you’ve come across in this video though.. I can see why you’ve felt the need to “defend” yourself, I just feel you let the people/fans you’ve got do it for you. Other than ‘quick views’ I’m not sure what this does to further you.
You're the TRUE geordie for a reason. respect to you for asking the right questions and handling the situation well. You're good at what you do, dont let fickle dickriders tell you otherwise.
I'm a massive fan of Tyson Fury and do you know what. Everything you said TG was bang on the money. Well done for providing perfect interview 👏
Wow
I felt that inteview was an amazing tyson interview. I loved how you didnt just suck him off and boost his ego. Loved that you asked the hard questions Its hard journalism and Geordie nailed it here.
I'll be honest I'm a Fury fan but Tyson really lowered his standards on the podcast.
The true geordie is class, ❤️👌 xx
So glad you made this follow-up video Brian, you deserve a standing ovation for that epic rant. All facts my friend! Let's see if iFL clip any of your latest video? I f*****g doubt it! Listening to Umar shill for Fury & criticise your questions was laughable and needed calling out.
Changing the game. We're all sick of sanitised BS interviews and you nailed it
About fucking time someone said this to Fury, couldn’t of handled it better, he was having an attitude before you even spoke , he’s only a prick
Gareth A Davies pissed me off the most with his response to your interview!
I am not paying to watch Tyson Fury fight a man who lost to Agit Kabayel, sorry.  Well done Geordie for calling him out on this.
Dereck recently beat Usyk in many peoples eyes, done Pulev in his last fight, Listen, this is a 50/50 fight
Tyson Fury sounded like an arrogant prick in the interview Geordie you came out of that interview looking like a complete professional
i think like you said Fury needed to fight now hes desperate cause he has alot of bad demons in hes head no wonder hes heavyweight champion 😅
I find it funny and disappointing that's he's all about mens mental health yet he continues to throw insults to people
There two irony's to this whole thing. The first being that true geordie has now sold the fight to everyone. And secondly it'll come to fruition that it's not going to be a competitive fight and he sold us out for his pal. It's a shame for boxing.
Couldn't get a better interview 👍 surprised he didn't call you a dosser though
Tyson made himself look like a right tit and I was watching the interview and I think he thought that last part was gonna be cut out and his mask slipped. TG i agree with ya and i love what ur doing. keep going man and dont let anything stop u.
Nailed it pal!
The Tyson Fury fans have gained a lot of respect for you Brian. 👏
Maybe have some more respect for the heavyweight champion of the world, and talk to him exactly how you would face to face.
You could tell he was getting rattled from the first 30 seconds 😂
I love absolutely everything about what you’ve just said so refreshing to finally come across someone who’s got the balls to confront these massive egos
Careful Geordie, Tyson gonna throw a dolly through that back window one of these days
Great man, great interviewer. Enjoy the bag from these videos
Fury got called out on his bullshit.
I think he has done this as a favour to Chisora, for Chisora's last fight
all im saying is Youtubers would have been annoying shopkeepers back in the days before youtube
I think, True Geordie Brian could take, Tyson Fury out in 5 rounds. Yep! I'd rather see that, more than, Tyson Vs Derrick. Lol 👀
Brian… you’re a bloody legend! Don’t ever stop being real! P.S. I LOVED you’re detailed analysis of Leon’s KO win! 👏
😂 go on Geordie 😂👊
all love and respect for you
He handled the interview perfectly Tyson Fury was just being a massive bellend
TG vs Gypsy King 😂
Congrats on 2million! 🎉
Well done
TG handled the interview perfectly
I've got a blk belt in origami... 🤣😂🤣
Mate he said it with a smile - it was practically banter, how are you still crying about this days later.
Loved your Jordan Peterson interview
TRUE GEORDIE FOR PRIME MINISTER
If you want to heel on fury. Just call him luke.
All I have to say true geordie is 🙌🏼🙌🏼 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Tyson is not a youtube fighter, Tyson was out jogging as a young lad at 5am on icy cold Winter mornings when Jake paul was tucked up in bed wearing pyjamas watching dysney
Right on
You are the real media Brian the media of today just do what there told no real journalism anymore
Great video mate, nailing it
Fair play Geordie. You are the goat 🐐
I felt like you were hitting him with negativity right from the start of the interview
Fury came across as off in that interview straight away. He’s got an unbelievably fragile ego for being the heavyweight champion. Saying that as a Fury fan.
I still think Tyson was just being Tyson. Didn’t think it was serious at all.
Announce TG Vs TF!!!
maybe he was just hungrey
You were spot on Brian, this is an easy payday for Tyson and he knows it, waste of a fight
Well done Geordie! Put it on Fury and the others are jealous trying to berate your interviewing skills when most of them wouldn't put anyone to task
Bald by choice 😂😂
This guy needs to stick to UFC. Doesn’t have a scooby what he’s talking about. Oh yes let’s risk the unification fight 😂
Legend
Bet Geordie is glad that the Fury interview shifted the Edward comments away 😂😅
The jokes are killing me 😂
Haven't caught up to the first interview coz i usually delay the fight stuff coz im not a boxing/mma fan, just leaving ya with the sweet algorithm comment, will watch this tonight after i catchup on the fury interview. Hilarious to hear tho you must've rattled him 😂 if you called him out on something he probably wasnt ready to sensibly defend thats when people tend to go into rant mode. Im assuming that is since i aint actually watched the fury interview yet. Keep up the great work.
You annoy me with your football opinions but I do think you’re a quality guy. Respect how you handled that mate
I reckon you intimidated him. I watched Cokey Mcfury on Mike Tyson podcast, came across likeable, but that was then.
True Geordie vs Tyson Fury is already better than Fury vs Chisora
Brilliant response Geordie 🤑
Loving your work, keeping going.
07:23 im crying 😂😂😂
💯
Been a Fury fan for ages, but this fight has annoyed me..
0:20 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I cancelled my pre order for his new autobiography after the video came out. Just didn’t like his attitude
Great video Brian
Geordie you can get 1000 good comments and just 1 bad one and the bad one will always stand out. Anyone with any emotional intelligence can see Fury was in a bad frame of mind from the start. Keep it up big man 💪🏼
Usyk is older than him too.
"found a lump, turned out I have massive balls" fucking luv it 🤣🤣🤣. You did brilliant Brian it was a great interview
Awesome job Brian, you needed to be the spectators voice. Tyson the big dosser not a fan when he acted the way he did towards you. Maybe he will blame his mental illness and instability who knows still no need for the way he was with you all the way through bud. Stay strong marra
That wasn't ego, it was shame.
Interview got ya to 2M subscribers, bro. Well done 🎉
Derek chisora is the Tony Ferguson of boxing ultimate BMF
Legend
Well we can all say that he’s the realist YouTuber in uk
I think the few fights he might have left will be easy ones just so he stays unbeaten
Yeah Tyson ' half a billy ' Fury certainly isnt interested in money 🤣🤣🤣🤣 As you can see by the comments Brian, you asked the questions and told him, what we are all thinking. Respect for not backing down.
It was about time someone called Fury out on his BS
You're a big enough guy to clip the loudmouth prick on the chin....Bout time too.
This is a great reaction to a feint jab into a headkick.
Sad
Spot on Geordie, glad you had the balls to ask the questions we all want to hear answered. Most journos like Gareth Davies lick Furys ass, this from a Fury fan.
Now it’s Conor mgregors turn to get a reality check within an interview
Now it’s Conor mgregors turn to get a reality check within an interview
I felt fury was just agitated off the bat before he even asked a question
Why don’t we start talking about boxing being corrupt and ran by money ffs   We’ve been asking for years for fury vs AJ and we can’t have it ?   Fury gives a mate a pay day and that’s wrong  But yet it’s okay for fighters to hang around all year for 1 fight ?   British boxings fucked atm
Well done TG. You absolutely smashed it and did what outlets like IFL are afraid to do and ask proper questions.
Yeah have the brawl Geordie wants it will sell like hot cakes... Get it done have the fight
Only 1 min in and you've destroyed him..again🤣
To be fair to you Geordie, sometimes you just have to put your hands up and say what a 3rd   Round knockout for Tyson Fury
You have nothing to be sorry about I agree with you 100%
Just confirming what fury said here ! Low blow again ! Can’t wait for you to bump in to them without cameras on
To call this fight non competitive is crazy
Ye Tyson is a bellend with unrealistic deadlines an games ... I like Big John though, his interview with you I was in stitches.
Is it just me or did it seem like Tyson was joking about cuz he said ‘good man’ before
i though tyson was on a bad mood from the begining... i like tyson but maybe just one of those days for him
Love it🤣
Me still sad that my favourite fighter lost but atleast we got see him in ufc watch his best moments ! Silva is the goat ! And I hope to learn from him and become silva for the next generation I'm doing mauy thai like how he did In the North East and hope to do mma and become a ufc fighter!
Balls of steel mate lol. You just kept going 💀💀💀😂😂
Fury is annoyed because he knew Geordie was asking all the right questions
Goat of youtube
Do u reckon he will say anything?
Sad to see your favorite fighter and favorite YouTuber beefing
I would love to watch that fight
I think you could beat him  bro
KSI question was misplaced .. awful question to start with
Glad you’re getting respect for doing what you did fury has really lost it and I’m glad people are noticing
TG handled Fury perfectly and said everything most fans have been thinking.  Most people would have melted in his presence but massive respect to TG for speaking the truth, even if he has blackballed you now 🤣
Get the at bag king
wheres the jake paul reaction brah
I think it was all set up just for the likes
Antony Joshua next TG
True gerodie vs tyson fury 2024
I loved Tysons reaction it's so fun but I don't think there's bad blood.
I wouldn’t worry mate, probably caught him on a bad day.
You have handled yourself perfectly, really embarrassing for Tyson...
Oh yeah!
Your a legend after that interview🥊
