Matt is a BEAST! This was crazy, fun and Epic all at the same time! Check out his video https://youtu.be/6IKvuvAiHSM
The pieces on the floor were worth millions
Guga ...... 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤
Matt is now 10% cow! This has to be a world record too for how many are broken in one collab!
Looks sooo good
Matt? You should do a video with Beard Meets Food, he has class! And no speed eating, set a 30 minute limit!
Guga I'd love to see you collab with beardmeetsfood
Do it again... but have Joel Hanson and one of his eating buddies go head to head. Max can help you cook...
Excuse me ,but with all the respect, this is not a proper charcoal fire. The coal has to heat up, not just catch fire. It can be seen clearly how that the procedure was pressured in order to save time, at the cost of quality. Whoever set the fires made the 2nd world record so much harder and uncontrollable. Well done to the cook who managed it.
im happy for these guys
I love your videos Guga. My rwinbrother is a meat freak and im a vegetarian but still love to watch.  I just want to warm about the risk of burning your cornea in your eye. Happened to me, im nearly blind since about 9 years ago.
2st world record lol
Guga looks like a more competitive eater lol
im glad i watched this
This is epic beyond scale!  What a collab.  Incredible video and thank you for putting this on!!!
This dude is gonna be so backed up downstairs 😅
Matt sent me
guga said this video didnt have enough views! help the brother out ;)
I can see why Guga doesn't have any hair
i am getting the meat sweats just watching this video
Absolute madness  This is what happens when a mad food scientists meet a food gobbler.  Awesome collab
Who else came here from Sonny’s video where Guga said they prepared 6 months for this video but still didn’t get to million views? Look at it now, already at 1.4million.
I love guga and Matt 😆 best collab ever!!!
This video is underrated
This is gonna go down in history as one of the best and greatest things in the world
You need to cook one of the rocks cheat day 😂😂
Guga is literally standing in the middle of a tornado of fire to cook the worlds most delicious steaks. Someone please make this anime lol
My dude just ate a whole F150
When is Guga going on Iron Chef ?!?!....
Cooking and Eating both are awesome!!!!! Thumbs up to you Guga and Matt
the only reason hugs was able to achieve this record is due to the insane barrier of entry of even attempting something like this. Truly a rich man’s world record
Guga, you're one beautiful, crazy man
Fire Lord Guga 🔥
Do you still have eyebrows?
Dose anyone no the name of the grill ?
I think deer taste better
GUGA vs max the meat guy
Dude that steak at the 0:29 mark… wow
Even playing Overcooked stresses me out!
Step one to beating this world record: have 30k to burn
This vid is so sweet you guys need to do more collabs! Also editing is 🔥🔥
im here because of Uncle Roger ang Guga collab. hahaha
Ok... 22,000+ calories in 5 minutes... So... How much liquid/solid Butter of the Gods adds up to 22,000+ calories and how fast can he drink/eat it?
Guga!  I would uproot my whole life for a chance to come and cook with you! I watch your videos everyday. I absolutley love cooking and experimenting with different  methods and flavors. Steak above all of course. and your a man of my own heart on seasoning ( salt, pepper, garlic powder).  The only place ive noticed we differ is on spicy as we all know your pallet is a baby for spicy.
I love competitive eating. I love Matt stone! I love Guga! So much! But it definitely hurts a little to watch him devour the wagyu… it seems like such a waste of the most decadent and expensive meat
This is terrible!  To have all this food, and see someone consume the food in such a demeaning way, is just disappointing!
Guga & Matt is to cool for skool awesome...😊

I can here because best ever food review show.
Some people have drug dealers, guga has meat dealers. I’ve seen it all
Bro matt must have a gut of steel to process all that steak.
Guga food is the only youtube channel I hit like before I even watch the video. 🤣🤣🤣👍
Wow, crazy stuff! Epically entertaining! What a cool idea!
thank god you wore your mask's outside.. who knows what could've happen if you didnt
Guga you are putting out content that belongs on a tv channel man
guga you’re crazy… “exactly” 😂
These steaks look so good!
Have you tried smoke steamed breaded steak? Put honey Sriracha and BBQ sauce in with the egg wash and bacon bites in with the dry, put your seasoning on the bacon bites and in the dry. Make sure to double batter!! Use tallow for the fry material and only fry to 75%, don't look for proper crispness just yet; lightly dust with brown sugar and place in smoker. For first half of smoking, place pineapple juice mixed with remaining tallow in a bottle and lightly spray every few minutes,  Allow to come to temperature, rest and enjoy.
I think the people who watch your channel don’t care to see some guy stuff his face with thousands of dollars of premium steak.  We subscribe to you for the crazy experiments, elite cooking skills and beautiful side dishes 👌🏾
Something about watching guga surrounded by fire, wearing flame resistant gloves and his face mask makes it look primal to me.
The forced eating at the end was an insult, this is the most expensive beef in the world and you have someone just Stuffing his face with it??? DISGUSTING!
2st?
as some one who at one point (stoned and post workout) who ate 9 steaks in a sitting i do not envy matt stonies's meat sweats and the bathroom trip after. Great work yall!
Vegan warning: This video may contain Flavor and normal human being
Wasted steak imo
oh my god. I was looking for Ward to all the fire and grills. but it's a cook up of the highest quality meat for a speed eater. enough for 50 people to try meat they have never eaten before. kick the cow in the balls just before hand. so disrespectful to Wagyu.
Here to help Guga get more views lol
Did you have to specify Olive Wagyu? Are there already better general Wagyu records?
That was a intimating intro lol
Guga try to make kobe beef biryani 😬😬😬😬
I refuse to watch this.
why do i keep watching these types of videos despite me knowing damn well i know i cant cook these foods
@4:59 “And I know what a lot of you’re thinking: ‘Guga, you crazy!’…   Absoluteleh!”  You are an absolute gem, Guga. Never change.
Why passing the steaks you ve cuted?
Matt stonie is the good version of nikocado
That vegan teacher would love this
How many collabs: Matt "Yes"
I really enjoy your content normally but this is the opposite of honouring the animals and the great food we enjoy in rich countries. Its spitting in the face of all the people dying of hunger in this world.
Dry age in yeast extract
I live in the Yaeyama archipelago, which is one of the major producer of black Wagyu. If you can put your hands on it, I recommend trying sashimi Wagyu. Thin slices of raw beef, with a pinch of  non-industrial salt and drops of sudachi or yuzu.
Dude
Matt doesn't look like a kid anymore
I'm so sorry, but I hate with a passion your voice.  (Bald guy) but I love your videos
I cringe when I watch Matt eat that wonderful food that fast. I would saver every bite of that.
Home Screen on the Phone
I couldn't tell which grill was being used in this video.  It didn't look like the weber grill linked in the description.
The video feels rushed. I’m sure that we miss so much more interesting content in between that I would love to have seen.  In other words, we always want more of Guga!
E
I loved it.
I’m following you my fellow Floridian 🌴
You should dry age steak in tomato sauce
Can you dry age with garam masala
i think im going to attempt to beat this grilling record. lemme go buy some wagyu real quick
What a waste of steak. Not chewing enjoying the taste of each bite. Just inhale it...... smh  thats the problum with food eating competition, it's timed. You should be able to compete as long as you eat it all.  No chewing equals choking
Wow I am so late but this is extremely crazy
Try aging in wasabi, Japanese mirin, or sechuan peppers
"My meat dealer" Sounds like this is a black market operation. 🤣
Hi there, fellow countryman (more or less, I think you're by now more American than Brazilian 😋)! Just here to say I love and salivate over your channel and suggest you support Chef Brian Tsao's desire to have a collaboration video with you. I just saw him reviewing your yeast dry-aging experiment video and he literally fell in love with your channel. He's a very good chef who does great food review/reaction videos and I for one think your mutual collab would be great. Anyway, just trying to help. Thank you!
Let me question something do you know where you will go after you die? If not let me say you can have a choice to either go to hell or heaven see 2000 years ago there was this man named Jesus who died on the cross for our sins and rose alive 3 days later all because he truly loved us he died for us so I question you now do you truly believe in Jesus or do you live for the world turn to Jesus Christ trust in him Christ has way much more to give than the world he loves us turn to Christ!!
I didnt realiza that wagyu beef have that many flare, because anyvideo that cooked beef wagyu cook wthout charcoal
The crust on those steaks! Guga is the man!
Guga can you do the coffee experiment with maple syrup? Control, dry brine, slurry and dry aged. And maybe no garlic powder for this one?
From mate
Before I die I would like to know how good wagu taste like !! Matt stone you lucky !!
Beast~Mode!
One eats a lot quickly for a living the other one cooks for a living. There is a difference between the difficulty I'll say that much
DRY AGE STEAKS IN MASHED POTATOES
Damn guga u the charcoal,fire,meat master lol I love it
M2   A 1
Guga is the best 👌❤🔥
Such a waste. This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Hotdogs are one thing,  but waygu? That's just a crime against humanity.
My car was $22,000 that slab of beef is worth as much as my car wtf 💀
Welcome Gugajiii
That's great..... Gugajiii....😘😘😘
Watching that rat boy eat is enough to make u puke!
Wow You Guy's Got Me Back 💥💯😎👍
Great accent. Anyone know where he's from
Wagyu a5 dry aged in cooked bone marrow butter
Sapi
The world's best beef consumed like they're in a hot dog eating competition. That hurt to watch.
Hey Guga can you please dry a steak in open pit barbecue sauce❤️.
saludos desde Oaxaca México
The music & cinematography added to the epic viewing experience.
up so we get more views
Hater
Speed, and premium beef,  Who cares? Other than telenovela youtube reality TV show drama? love your stuff Guga, but minus a lot, major for respect for this. Literal gluttony + the best beef in the world?  It will probably generate way more money than catering to people like me though, Have fun....  Are you still having fun Guga? Are you sure? Really sure?
Yoooo
Imagine not being able to savor the wagyu because you have to chug it down real quick.
hi guga. Kindly attempt this project after withdrawing from your paypal account and send over some 1000 kgs of the waygu dry aged at Tankard along Ngong road in nairobi. Here is $2,000,000 for the project. $14,000 per kg, your costs at $5,000 and profit at $3,000. When they come dry aged I will sell 1 kg at $25,000 for a 20% profit.
Your name is not guga  your name is Fire man
I a great fan of your channel but I don't have dollars to join your channel, membership perks. My bad. Thanks!
matt stonie is the man
Hook me up with this Emilio guy!
Hi Guga please use Georgian sparkling water “Borjomi” to marinade the steak 🍀🥩
This was a dumb video and break of "records".....from, somewhere.
I can eat more Wagyu than Matt, Gugs. Gimme a chance!
Wow Guga x Stonie, what a great video guy’s, i myself feel i am a combination of both these gentlemen. I am a never ending pit like matt, and a nice kind caring meat lover like Guga, oh and everything in between.
Shoulda had randy santel eat
That’s a insult to the steak, eating it so fast
Next NickDigiovani will be a part of 6 world records in 1 video
Can I ask why you cut on that side of the steak,it seems awkward. Is there a technical reason?
Song name at 5:42 pls
Guga looks badass cooking those steaks imo
Guga, what product do you use for the wireless digital read thermometer? I’m looking to get one and need a recommendation.
Guga makes me want steak every time I watch his videos
Guga: "I'm going to chop as much as I can in a min"     Matt's mind: "he is trying to kill me on camera"
Guga...you like black pepper. you like garlic powder try dry age with either and both. love from Trinidad & Tobago
Hey Guga,  I have this great question that I think you are the only one to answer  Can you make an experiment and compare bone marrows from 3 different beef  American Wagyu Bone Marrow Angus beef Bone Marrow Japanese Kobe Beef Bone Marrow  Do they taste the same or will the Kobe Beef Bone Marrow win it all?
Hey man, I know this video is old, but just found you. You're one of the most wholesome people out there. I really respect your craft/admiration and especially how you treat other people. You're a good dude.
My guy is going to have the tastiest meat-sweat.
He wasted that wagyu!!!
Chugging premium meat with soda,  MURICA at its finest
How did Matt Stoney do this
I wonder how much time matt spent in the bathroom afterwards
6:53 7:12 the b-roll shots were hilarious they did all that with the grills just to get the shot of Guga an and Matt standing in the middle of it.😂
Guga you forget that MattStonie was popular before you were even a channel?
Wholly crapp
You probably will never see this but I have to ask what kind of grills you used they are Awsome
Change the title, put matt stonie in it.
Watched: 22-4-12-22-00
Imagine doing all of these and the video file gets corrupted or got lost😭 Anyways, this was an epic adventure to watch. You guys are awesome!
Imagine looking back at your WR attempt years later and realizing what a doofus you were for wearing a mask that doesn’t work, for an artificially inflated fear. Wait — too soon?
Gaga was and mat were in there element
neither of these guys will make it to 65 lol
Guga is the most formidable, o churrasqueiro dos churrasqueiros
I love how nicks comment got more likes the comment of the for the vid lol
"THREE WORLD RECORDS in ONE vid". This is a master  piece!!!
They both seem like the nicest people
Your best is real in the world is the worst
What a show I saw Both videos obviously
Guga, are you using Adrenaline Barbecue Company SnS Grills 22" Cooking grate? My default weber grill the handles are welded below the circular frame so I can't get the spinny spin you do on my grate. I had to grind them down to do that.  Congrats on the records. i still don't understand how he was able to eat 8lbs of waygu
I'm here because you mentioned  in your vid with sonny that this is not doing too well
Just watch how Matt devours $8,000 worth of wagyu A5 in 5 mins that guga prepared for hours
We should bring matt to eat an entirely dry age angel
Gross
Hi Guga this is Moloko from Pretoria South Africa please do a video whereby u do Biltong with a Wagyu steak. So Biltong is a South African snack whereby its beef meet that is dried for a couple of days and it's than cut into pieces and ready to be eaten but don't forget to season the meat before drying but you need to Google the process of drying it because it is totally different from the way you do it.
Competition eating makes me never, ever want to eat whatever they are eating ever again.
so much wagyu fat  how did he do it
You 100% would've gotten more views if you put Matt Stonie in the title. I came from the $300 vs $1600 Steak video
Watching this 6000 times so Guga hits 1M
As I commented on Matt's video, this is the Hummer SUV of food videos.  I generally like Guga's videos, but this is kind of over the top.  This is Roman Vomitorium level stuff.  How much decadence and depravity can we stuff into a video?  I might be making more of it than is actually there, but for me, watching someone stuff $4000 worth of food into their face is just pure gluttony.
Man that was cool you were a beast with that knife. I can't believe he eat like 8 pounds of meat. That's one of my goals in life to try A5 waygu stake, Australian waygu and American waygu. Keep the awsome films going.
What is the blue drink?
Watch out for that fresh air it’ll kill ya 😷
Only is the  audience got to taste
This guy just ate more wagyu in 5 minutes than I will ever get to eat in my life.
Guga........ your a monster 👻 out of this world 👽, you can tell you put alot of thought into this! Congratulations!
What kind of charcoal is being used?
What is wrong with Americans? That was really a disgusting spectacle...
I saw you talking abt how this video took U months of prep yet didn't do well in terms of views. Long time follower let me tell U why honestly: Ur channel is about the food and cooking methods. Yes we get attached to your persona but in the end we want to see food and cooking. This video for example focus too much on the people and some sort of record we don't care or even know about. Taking focus away on your main channel theme is always disastrous. Hope it helps
Please, try lemon pepper steak so good 🤪🤪🤪🤪
I think if you added Matts name in the title, would def gain more attention.  Stumbled on this by accident b/c I love Matt Stonie and follow his page and saw it.  But great video! love your content!
Man what a waste of steak
what truck u driving mr guga
guga is really really a nice guy
Matt: it’s a challenge not to savor 😅
there was no like button on the initial video, you have to find the video manually to get the like button...
i just found this channel and i'm obsessed
I’m so hungry now
What a waste of prime steaks! I bet he did not taste a thing.
Sir, What if animal extinct?  Would you use other organism? Like penguins? Well, dolphins are human communicator. You should be vegan.
Came here from sonny’s collab, was nottt disappointed. Letz let this vid to a millionn
I have a request if that's okay! Could you dry age steak with Whataburger's limited edition spicy ketchup sauce, please? ^^ I would definitely love to observe if the steak becomes enhanced or not! Thank you for reading! :D
The cinematography and editing makes it feel like a huge coming of age, great accomplishment documentary, shoutout to your camera man. I'd definitely watch an hour of your preparation to accomplish this feat
I had a full 1lb wagyu once, however u spell it, and my stomach was in pain
Guga, do Pesto dry-age!! Cheers from Italy :)
This feels like an insult to cooking. Maybe i just dont get it because im not american, but this just feels crass and tacky.
A car or a piece of steak?
I can smell the Brazilian bbq from here hehe
All vegans died
bought all the stuff today. My Gringo soninlaw who I LOVE so much found your video.  We will cook this weekend. Might even get the Komodo grill. will let you know and post a photo.
Guga, could you do an experiment with different charcoals to see which one is the best??
“And I know allot of you thinking guga you crazy. Absolutely ” 😂😂😂
AMAZING, thought your meat dealer worked out of a back of a truck in an alley at 2AM..
Wow no one wanna be in the or on the  toilet after matt stonie
Pow Guga, agora tem que fazer uma colab com o Corbucci ein kkkk
YouTube premium right here.
How do you make cooking look so cool
Awesome video!! I can't be the only one cheering Guga on while he sliced those steaks🤣😅🔥🔥
1:38 and this is how you stab a man
Hopefully Stonie remembered to take aspirin beforehand.
wow that makes me hungry! looked amazing!
I miss your Dry aged experiments.... Can you dry age beef shank?
Collab of the century
Damn, Guga lives like a king
wow buy 1 get two free
And this is why gugas bauld
Nice dalstrong been using them and shun knifes as a line cook and love them
7:13 is the most epic scene and probably best moments of Gugas Food legacy
I'm all on board for the world record, but what are the judging parameters? Did someone judge thickness? Consistency? Was there a restriction on what knife could be used? I'm very confused as to why this a WR when it's just a well made youtube video.
Awesome!
Man I love all these colabs
Most steaks I’ve cooked in 1 night was a steak fundraiser (350 New York strip in 3 hours) not a single steak was over or under cooked (most I’ve had on the grill at one time that night was 42 steaks from rare to well done)
So is it Wagyu or KOBE ?   Wagyu “at least here in Texas” is a black angus bred to a Kobe cow “from Japan”. Great marble and can be very impressive.   If anyone can clarify Id appreciate it. Cheers 🍻
The amount of fat that was consumed made me obese
Mano, Guga. Teus vídeos são foda. Te acompanho desde uns milhares de seguidores. Tu é amazing!
May help to make a metal cutting board and freeze it to keep the fat from breaking down when your cutting
Is noone really gonna talk about how epic looking that shot of Guga and Matt at 7:14 is? Music is also perfect for the moment
Great production too
That is TRULY THE MEAT SWEATS!!😄🤤🤯
His voice sounds like jar jar Binks from Star wars
What grills are those?
Is it just me or what but Guga really looks like Dana white from ufc 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Came here from matts’s video...this is crazy
This has to be the most delicious record
I would like to see you opening a restaurant
Subscribed @matt!!! Go Guga foods!!! Best video ever!
Stonie directed me to your channel and glad he did you my friend are a legend of the food world
This channel is going places. I remember it being way smaller than what it is now. Proud to one of the early subscribers
Guga send me some wagu foods
hi Guga i really loved youre show its is tremendously good and i like character as a crazy but kind hearted human  keep on experimenting it really open my eyes and whole lot of new cooking youre influence around the world really a source of inspiration this pandemic period and  i believe youre legacy as a chef cook really captivate the heart of foodlovers like im wondering someday i want to have my own restaurant name guga foods because of you and whenever i hear or everyone hear the name of guga or gustavo tosta  im sure  they will smile beacuse they will remember youre love and inspiration in cooking good foods,😍❤️❤️❤️ love from the Phillipipines
Wagyu birra tacos vs beef birra tacos!!!!!
The steak looks so good but omg Matt is asking for a heart attack 😭😭
Love your stuff, not a fan of competitive eating. Upvote, subscribed, but competitive eating is a garbage sport.
Meat dealer
I would love to have you on my podcast. Talk yo iSHH. I’m in Florida but I would come to you.
Did I just hear Guga say "this is a regular steak" lol
this record probably won't be broken in a long time because of how expensive it is
vegns:NO Stop that think of all the poor animals Guga:haha meat go brrr
But are the records official? Lol
You're Brazilian, not crazy lol!
He can eat his own body weight, figuratively pound for pound 😂😂
Guga! I am a HUGE fan, PLEASE do an experiment where you dry age a steak in preserved lemon!
Lowkey he pissed me off with how he ate that😒😒
I am waiting to see guga Matt nick d and lynja
That's a waste of good wagyu
You guys could pass as being relatives lmao
If that was 8 ponds of steak and matt is 134 pounds that means that after he ate that he was 5.63 percent steak
What a mad lad
you need to learn how we Argentinians grill.......you burn the meet in the fire, for us that's it a sin!! :)
What a waste of money... just for another ridiculous video challenge.
Guga and Matt Stonie make a perfect combination.  Love the video!
Two heroes unite, remarkable scenes.
Guga starts god mode
You are extremely talented👏🙌🏻👏please get this proper air time💕it’s epic
That Wagyu was ruined on the grill .. no way it should be cooked on an open flame
This speed eating thing is so cringe and wrong
a duo i never knew i needed
this video makes me so mad, this guy just wastes all that wagyu on a challenge? And i know i'll never even try a steak that good? Shame...
To each their own. I think this one was over the top. Olive Wagyu steaks is some of the highest quality in the world and seeing it being treated like this makes me a bit sad. Would feel similar if it was a drinking contest with a person trying to finish as much Domaine de La Romanee Conti wine in 5 minutes.. Kinda wasteful.
so he started from freezing stage, to hot burning stage. The shift haha
You should do a deep fried burger ;) literally deep fry the whole burger!
Guga in middle of all those grills looks a final boss of a dark souls game
Legends.
tu as le même sourire qu'un pote d'enfance : )
Nice job that was amazing
What a show!! seeing the Charcoal Pit Overlord work up his fiery magic in such serene settings. Some place you got there Guga.
How's the alligator going?
7:13 awsome  <3
he definitely had a really bad time late in the restroom. no doubt in my mind.
Congratz on 3m subscriber guga
What an epic video...!
What skills
You should have cut 12.....I am disappointed.
You should do lotteri of your followers and the winner get a trip to your place (trip, living all 1 week payed for, from the the whole world), and the winner have a lifetime food experience!
7:14 now thats a thumbnail! very nice :D
Haha,great vid guys
I'm here coz of matt😃
man matts toilet must hold a lot of grudges.
I’m actually positive that I’ll never have the opportunity to try a wagyu steak. And it’s absolutely depressing! 😭😭😭
It pains me, makes me SICK, to see Wagyu cut into tiny strips as if it's skirt steak. I don't care what the challenge is. It's sacrilege.
I was watching matt  and he said check out your video so here I am
I'm just suprised Guga wasn't worried about cutting his fingers off     This man has some of the sharpest knives
Eat the most Lobsters 🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞
the fat dripping from matt’s hands
HI
I watch both these dudes never thought I'd see a vid together lul epic
Im proud of you Guga! Im glad ive been here for a long time
7:19 this is such a glourious moment
Why would you eat wagyu that fast? 😩 It’s so frustrating.
9:04 the most sincere laugh I’ve ever heard from Guga
This was fun to see from your perspective. It must have been a challenge in itself that you learned or practiced slicing in the walk in freezer but executing the challenge outside in the heat. Butchering is such an art. Well done.
Wanna see Matt eat the whole cow to bone.
Awesome 👍
Amazing mashup i love it!!!!
Guga, Grats to you and how far you have come. I remember subscribing to your channel sous vide everything when your maybe had 20k subscribing. Your hard work, dedication and talents are proof that you can do it if you really want to in a great country like we are privileged to live in.  Keep living the dream!!!!
I know it's for records and all that, but seeing this much Wagyu eaten like it's at a hot dog eating contest just hurts my soul. What a waste of Wagyu.
This was an awesome video!
Wow wagyu a5 steak out of this world man
This is sooo cool! I love Matts performance!
Guga you been on a diet?
my man became spongebob for this video
“Your crazy”!!!!!!  Absolutely!!🤙🏿🤙🏿🤙🏿🤙🏿
7:13 that was a sweet shot of all the grills around you guys. Just amazing
Amazing
Only one word to describe this Collab - Epic! Well done guys! 🥩🥩🥩
A pro bowling ball weighs 15 to 16 Ibs can you cook it?
Make Matt Stonie a bowling ball burger 🍔
What is this an Avengers level team up?
Guga training to cut all that meat is like the anime we need but don't deserve
That was disgusting, such a waist of Wagyu steaks..
Honestly, I'm disgusted by the "most eat"-part of the video, in more ways than one.  I wholeheartedly am happy for your success and that you have the means to cooperate with people on stuff on this scale, still, this video...urgh.  Where is the respect you usually show for the meat, Guga? Is the wagyu you praise so much not worth much more if it's really savored instead of forced down as fast as possible?  Then there is the respect for those of your viewers who can't even affort a single wagyu steak.  Here's an idea: Make a social media-event. Everyone who participates, sends a video to you why they would like to try wagyu once. For every steak cut in this video, you pick a winner and send them an olive wagyu steak. Have them record how they enjoy it, make a compilation of those vids and load it up here.
This guy s usin a massive a5 wagyu for demo(-_-) 4:13
The steaks are just completely melting and showering over is hands, but he needs water. loll
WHOA! Guga is looking slim here.
This is insane! this video is definitely more intense!! Hats off to you Guga
This was a dumb challenge and huge waste. All burnt steaks also smh
I know it might be hard to get, might even require travel. But I would love to see you try out Hanwoo Korean beef A++ Perfectly marbled but just short of Wagyu so you can eat more of it
I thought I was already subbed to Guga, well now its official!
Disgusting
Guga.  For your Filipino fans.  Please make any dish Filipino.  And I with other pinoys would be incredibly happy!
Vegan teacher left the chat
Next one
When the fire comes out form the steak it’s like hell but VERY AMAZING
Really liked the video but did y’all see all them beautiful females!😍💯😂
The quality of these videos are insane!
OMG
I came here from Matt Stonie's YouTube vidoe Mr. Guga. I'm pleased to be a new subscriber of yours!
Two of my favorite YouTubers!!! That's awesome!! 👍👍
Bro this is fire 🔥 content sheeesh.

So what happened to Matt afterwards?
Where the vegan bishes at
Guga is the flame grill steak king. Firelord Guga!
Hello new subscriber sent from Matt great to be here 😉🤟

Legendary
Guga makes me feel like I’m in a movie every time😂💯
Centrist championships
Okay this is just wrong

The title of master butcher is so cool

how do you not die fo,e eating all that meet your going to get a hart attack matt sorry I thought this was mats channel I watched both videos you and his
Guga this is the first video of you which I really disliked and I shall explain why.  First of I am familiar with both of you and I like the both of you very much.  the reason I dislike this video is because I see wagyu meat as a delicatese, a art form, something to be throughly enjoyed. this isnt some super market meat that can be used to be butchered in a contest. to be honest I felt disgusted when I saw the meat being butchered in just pushed down the throat and to be fair I think this goes against your whole channel which I normally love to watch with joy.  even the fact that there are alot of people here enjoying such expensive meat when they may not be able to purchase it on them own to see a man just forcing it down his throat without even enjoying ever bit op taste there is to it..  I have no words for it. I hope I may never see a video like this on your channel.
6:38 it says “2st” in the text
He eat it in close to 8mins. How much it cost from butcher, and how much it can cost in restaurant?
You gotta say it man, that thumbnail looks incredible. Proud of you Guga!
The Collab we did not expect but needed, thank you gentlemen both, my favourite eating channel and favourite barbecue channel
Guga please dry age an eye round in beef tallow! The eye round doest have enough fat so when toy dry aged it it’s just dried up
Guga just milking wagyu content is the reason I unsubscribed. Boring and not appetizing.
1. where did the rendered fat go? bet it would have made awesome gravy. 2. were those steaks cooked well done? was that by matt’s request? 3. makes me want to try wagyu for sure, but rare
Yum
guga lookin handsome
Baba booey
Im so stoked to see you guys do a collab. Just finished watching Matt inhale 8 steaks in 5 minuets and now going to enjoy the art of how you cook. 🔥 🥩   (ALSO youtubes broken system unsubbed me despite me watching you all the time)
Us: Guga you crazy  Guga: Absolutely  Together: Let's do it!
This feels epic. Thanks for the good content
Mmmm, I just can’t see the point of that waste, other than the fun.
No respect for the wagyu! That meat came from an animal that was raised with care! In a matter of minutes the craze for more views, clicks and likes just discarded everything that makes that meat special!  Maybe just try to make quality videos rather than quantity! This one was just pitiful!
0:04 Guga is preparing to commit a hate crime
Me when I see the amount of wagyu right there: HOLY CRAP THAT LOOKS SO GOOD  Guga: I cut some steaks
Never in my life, I've seen such an epic montage of a man cooking Wagyu Steaks
Porra, Guga. Tem que chamar o Corbucci pra umas doideiras dessas!
Awesome video man 👍
@guga foods can you do a bistecca fiorentina with the chianina beef vs the same cut in wagyu?
Make food from One Piece!
wearing masks to not spread covid at the grill when lighting them. Like it matters when blazing hot fire is burning.
Dude ur a beast I thought u were fat
My favorite chef on YouTube and my favorite competitive eater 😩😩 amazing video!!!
Guga! Try magnesium to tenderize the meat!
Now we just need Guga to cook some food (doesn't need to be Wagyu =P) for Mr Beast Philanthropy that will be a hell of a way to end the year!
My idols in one frame 💕
if salt bae is the king of steaks,then guga is the one who created steak
This hurts....
😕
Can we see Guga’s stuffed peppers?
And the think people in Haiti eating clay. 🤷
Matt’s Stomach is in pain while Guga’s Heart is in pain
Youtube now can see comments on fullscreen mode. Nice
I already know angél was hating from the sidelines 😂
I’d die for a bite of one of those lol
Guga you are the greatest!!
Really said you might  think I’m crazy “ absolutely “
I always love how the music makes it seem like the steak grilling is some epic battle of the gods.  The imagery helped a lot too with this one! Guga... You're the coolest uncle of all time. Dos Equis should take you as a mascot.
I have never eaten tasted it
Only americans could do something like that. This is a prestigious type of meat that Japanese people treat with regard and respect. Here you can see the brutality of America that has to make things “extra”, big and in large scale every time.  PS. I don’t care, it is just a thought of mine, the thing is: I think you won’t ever see a Japanese person do something like that. They have a totally different mentality
That was great Guga!!! I hope to see more things like it. Congratulation on your world record!
"Guga ur crazy"  Guga: yes
all that olive wagyu matt eats cost a house
8:55 damn what's the @ of that chick in the back tho?
Who's here because of Matt? Im craving!!!
Let man stoni eat
Bald man cook now or get poop
Guga is our poop in bangladesh
I never ate a buttery steak before, when i become wealthy i will definitely eat one.
“You must be thinking Guga is crazy. Absolutely.”
I am the one this time: Angel vs. Mamao Steak battle with their own side dish. Guga is the Judge. LETS DO IT!
Emilio's butcher: I can beat that record. Guga: Lesdoit!
Matt eat a lot but he is skinny bro why
rip vegans
The master of cooking and the master of world eating records.
Why does it look like guga does the eating and matt does the cooking 😭 ily both btw
That meat should be shared and savoured, not wasted like this. Poor animal died in vain.
Guga. When you are experiencing difference between normal steak and A5 steak, your face reaction is like that master chef guy.
Those 🥩 shots tho!!! 😋
Estou amando esse canal, Love you Guga 🥰😍
Guga can you dryage whole cow? 😁
best video i have seen for the past year. love the collab. just wow
7:13 is a deadly shot
Barf 😂
Angel gonna be jealous youre cooking for somebody else
I didn't know guga lives in mansion...
Stonie sent me
What two legend performance
@Guga Foods What’s the name of the meat dealer?
Sick Vid!
my two heroes!!
That was just amaizing and different to watch than usuall Guga Foods videos.. 3 World Records what a Epic day you guys have there love ur videos keep those coming have a great day byee <3
THIS VIDEO WAS NUTS DUDE OMG
I need a Guga Compound tour. His place looks baller.
Wasteful??? 🤔
Theres nothing like watching tuber millionaires cook and eat Meat you will NEVER have the honours of smelling never mind eating and were all just making them RICHER
You don’t cut a beautiful Japanese waygu with a cheap Chinese Dalstrong knife. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Seen Matt's video 1st and was immediately drawn to you. I seen 11 or 2 of your videos but this made me Subscribe. Thanks for the entertainment.
YES! Guga and Stonie collab!
YES! guga and stonie collan
6:35 2st WR
Two of my favorite YouTube food stars
Epic.
That little pause where Matt and Guga were together in between all the grills was honestly awesome
cringe
Guys! Shows us how to make a select ribeye amazing
Hey Guga, thanks for your great videos. After watching your videos, I have three requests for future videos: - Please try some other cattle breeds than wagyu and American beef. - How do you clean all your pans and other cooking ustensils so they continue to be so shiny ? - Please cook a foie gras in a terrine using sous vide. And yes I'll repeat those requests often. ;)
I really wish Emilio would let you try beef from other countries.
Beautiful, amazing & epic! Awesome collab! ❤️
thats crazy!
Mans cooking wagyu like its fast food 😅
Hey Guga, this is for you: 👑 The steak king!
Guga, normally I love your videos. But what was the point here? To waste as much money as possible? Let Matt eat 100 Big Macs, or whatever. But eating the world's most premium steak so quickly that he cannot taste it or enjoy it seems stupid. I'm no vegetarian; I enjoy steak. But why did some cow in Japan need to die for this circus stunt? Like I said, I enjoy steak -- ENJOY being the operative word. You can't tell me that anyone can really enjoy a steak by eating it in ten seconds. What a waste. Sorry, I can't watch it all.
Here from Matt's channel!  Subbed!!!  I was like hey that's the guy that ages steak in salt and butter!!!!
I’m extremely happy you’re doing what you love your a very cool guy and there’s not much things better then getting paid to eat awesome food  love you man
Me who’s only had low grade prime.
a collab i never knew i needed. my faves !!!
Based on principle on line he shouldnt let the human dumpster eat all of those steaks..so dumb.
I would die to eat one bite of these staks and Matt is eating them like its rice…
Guga should do a mini podcast in this place where he invites ppl to try the most amazing steaks he has ever done and ask em some questions like 20 mim videos
Guga is a rich man 😭😭😫🙏
So wasteful, at a time when so many struggle to just get by. Maybe something more relatable might not be the most popular. But it might be the right thing .  No shade on guga just my 2 cents
Guga you come up with a lot of goodness my3 my friend  !
5454654
Hey  Off topic but how about you dry age only with black pepper ??  Would be interesting
Guga can you do a WAGYU BIRRIA TACO recipe??? 🤔😁😁😁😁
Incredible
You're not suppose to cook Wagyu on the BBQ grill or smoke em....that's just wasting the precious expensive ass meat
More videos like that please
it is a sad thing to see such a wonderful steaks eaten in that way. Who did try this before anyways?
Is this okay to be called decadence?
2st
“ Guga your crazy “ absolutely -guga -😎
The YouTube food gods
Well that was the coolest meat challenge I've ever witnessed!!
This is the greates colab ever
Dry age meat with bone marrow is it possible??
Wtflol is this comment section? Nice collab looking forward to more xD
Please do something with BeardMeatsFood, Sorry Matt your a legend but the beard is best.
2st?
Feels good that 2 of my favourite "food channels" found each other
Ssssshhh
Should have used binchotan charcoal because it doesn't flame up at all.
bro, dry age in compound butter
Guga, don't you ever let anyone eat wagyu like that again. Poor wagyu, they need to be enjoyed not swallowed. Let Matt Stoney swallow brocolli instead.
dry aged wagyu brisket plez
what a waste of money,wagyu should be eaten slowly and enjoy the taste of the beef,if u want to do chalennge just use prime
That's some epic content right here, the editing, music, camera focus and mmoves and of course the content !! Impressive !
I love your channel mate, but that seems like a lot of wasted premium steak. Not how the farmer would appreciate it being eaten, and it is unlikely that anyone will remember the past, current or future record setter in this category. Thumbs down for me!
I can only imagine what charcoal seared a5 wagyu tastes like... T_T damn it looks amazing and your knife skills ON POINT
That was so fun to watch and dang Guga, you look like you’ve lost a good amount of weight!
Weaning mommas can easily beat that. Rawr!!!
Dude, your driving footage looks like a staged driving inside a studio with a background video haha that's some stable cameraman tho
That juicy wagyu drippin wet
I´ve never seen somethin more american
New Subscriber here! 😁 bcuz of matt stonie 🤟🏼👌🏻
waste of wagyu. you are clearly going dry on ideas for videos...
DO MATTS NEXT VIDEO, that expensive blue fin tuna sashimi.
Guga your channel before is better
6:35 secost
Yeah, I did think that Guga's meat dealer was just one guy with really good contacts.  Now Guga has just broken that fantasy for me. Thanks Guga!
Is it just me or did anyone else went to this video right before Matt started eating in his video?
I don’t get it. Cutting and eating Wagyu as fast as you can is just stupid.
matt stonie: "i eat for a living and you cook for a living". new viewers: are you sure its not the other way around???
Title should have been the creator and devourer
Incredible video!
I'd love to see more collabs with Matt Stonie
all well done?
now this is a collab
What a collab!
Beastt !
How many competitive eaters stay thin amaze me
I haven't watched the video but if this dude eats Wagyu as fast as possible, I'm disliking this video and every single video you make from this day forward.
0:43 guess which guy cooks the food and which guy eats the food
I always knew guga was from Kendall but WOW what a estate!
Is this gugas place like it wasnt rented
This was epic!!!!
The way he closes his eyes while he stuffs his face make me wanna vomit For him lol 😂😂😂
Man literally has a stomach that is worth more than my car.
non for the people sitting around?
What a waste 🤦🏾‍♂️
they really do be carrying youtube rn
Guga, bone marrow from a wagyu has a different taste from the bone marrow from cheaper breeds?
I didn't even watch the rest of the video but this is a waste of food to be scarfing down high quality meat like that. Wasteful.
why so thin? i wanna see a thick cut
Man just ate a 2016 car cash price I was looking at.
Man, just cutting $30/lb tenderloin makes me nervous, i can only imagine the nerves i would get cutting wagyu.
Guga lost some weight.
Wish all theses fantastic steaks were served to homeless peoples instead of being waisted to a useless Guinness record.. that would of been the best video you could of made…
Meh. Not for me - enjoy your vids generally but not this.
Im so jealous. That steak looks so good.
Guga, I love your videos.  You're an inspiration!  A couple of questions - was the Kobe roast you cut at GW frozen? Can you thaw a wagyu roast in the refrigerator, cut it into steaks, then vacuum seal and refreeze them?
This is the collab we food lovers have dreamed of
Me: Savoring every bite of a $10 NY strip steak I bought at Costco and cooked myself. Matt: Devouring $5000 worth of wagyu cooked by Guga without chewing. Me: Damn, life ain't fair!
Matt Matt Matt. Thanks for giving Matt such a good beef collab ❤️
There is no way that small guy eats all that rich wagyu! No effing way!
Hold up I’d I’m seeing this right Matt and gugs in one video together
I'm sorry, but all I can think of is what a WASTE it was for him to just gobble down those wagyu steaks...
👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
Go big or go home. Said no one ever like this till Guga and Matt
Now this is good content! Just subscribed!!
2 princes stood in front of the king that is wagyu...
You should invite more guest this was cooL bro.
cute girl in the background
Matt brought me here
No offense, Guga, but I like you better as a cook and 'neighbor' steak-enthusiast, than a celebrity performer.
WHAT A GREAT COLLAB 🥵🥵❤️💜🖤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
so whats the purpose of this aside wasting money
I felt the pressure for real as if I was the one cooking em up hahahahahaha amazing video, Guga!
Just saw matt his video and damn i didnt know thst guga was that rich. Makes me wonder what he did before he made his channels
Eat wagyu like that is a crime...
We cant eat one of them they slice an eat a few haundred of them , very sad
Lowkey died inside when he ate the wagyu like that but it's speed-eating so whatever.
Big video !!
As i commented on Matts channel,  Matt and Guga Collab, dream come true!! man I watch both your channels a lot,  had a blast with both videos! great stuff.
The collab I didn’t know I needed
That's was so crazy
This was a partnership of the ages, epic....
Cookie monster Matt :P
This video is monument to beefsmithery. Those steaks forged in the flames of flavour.
What a f ing waste of ingerdients and money. How much did those wagyu steaks cost? How about spending that money on feeding the poor? Of course, never gonna happen... because that would not generate the same number of  views.
Damn I’m surprised peta didn’t make an appearance 😂
i like you guga, but this is wrong on so many ways 😞
This collab is really great, keep it up, Guga!
Can you do a review of wagyu bacon and make it in different forms ex: pizza, sandwich, burgers?
That's fatty and so overkill lmao
instead of wasting this food on some UNHUMAN record, U could have fed it to the poor or starving people.
guga must be rich😂
I feel like Guga could've squeezed out number 12 at the end
Guga is like Soma Yukihira in omelette suf-le episode
@Guga....Amazin Music while cutting. :)
would you like to come to turkey for cooking whole buffalo or something ? i can handle the adjustments and management
And now I know, why it's so difficult to have wagyu... I feel like the farmer, who produces it, will have murder thought if he sees this video : how to completely destroy all the pleasure and hard work of everybody, that as contribute to make this wagyu. :(
Guga, vc deveria fazer uma Collab com o Ricardo Corbucci (Canal Corbucci Eats) eles está nos EUA e daria para fazer um desafio de carnes com dois Brasileiros 🍖🇧🇷
you look and sounds like Dana White
That thumbnail better than super hero landing scene 🔥🔥🔥
Freeze your eyebrows, burn your eyebrows you just can't decide can you?
This is just an exercise in obscenity.  Anybody who takes part in 'professional eating competitions', arranges, or attends them is just delusional and out of touch with the world.  Every time Guga makes an A5 Wagyu steak he is like "this is not something you want to eat a whole steak of, it's too rich, it's an "experience steak"", and now?  Now he is actively cooking A5 Wagyu for someone so they can eat 5 kgs of it, worth $15,000, in a few minutes.  Pure trash and obscenity.  Followed Guga for years now, but this is just ugly.  And the funniest thing?  Calling these "world records"?  LOLWAT?  These categories (most OLIVE WAGYU steaks cut, cooked, or eaten) don't even exist, so any number you do will be a "world record".  SMH.
Ok that's it !!        I'm heading to Outback now 😬
"I eat for a living." Only in America. I wish I could block these channels. I never want to see this again.
I'd ask who has money for a 450$ steak but parents are getting 300$/stupid kid these days for the next year.
He’s going to 💩himself
Guga's right arm been training his whole life for this moment 🥵
This is just a sin and the greatest disrespect of the animal and the product. Never thought i would be so disgusted by a Guga-video. Subsciption ended and i will never watch a single video on this channel. Decadence in its purest form. Shame on you.
The thumbnail is rly badass
Not enjoying this quality meat, it’s a pity really and I cannot see the point
dont like that waste of food :/ but everything else cool video
The collab we didn’t ask but definitely needed!
cant believe you'd disrespect waygu like that just shoving it down your throat. it's a delicacy no?
Anyone else slightly annoyed that the video says 2st instead of 2nd at the bottom 😅
Sees video.* MINDBLOWING.
One cook for living other one is eat for living, what a perfect match lol
YES GUGA THIS IS THE VIDEO WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR
Sick collab
2 of my favorite youtuber
Why do the steaks look over cooked
That’s Disgusting to watch
unsubbed, shamed for humanity to see what this Matt guy is doing. Cannot believe this :-(
Awesome collab!💯👏🏾
Something about this felt a little disrespectful to the beef
Bruh people complaining that the steaks shouldn't be eaten this way or that they should be savored are just wack man. There's hardly a better way to appreciate the value and quality of the meat than to use it for multiple world records and a crazy collab between two of the biggest food Youtubers. Guga's wagyu videos, this one definitely not excluded, likely have contributed to the overall consumption/appreciation of wagyu beef. I didn't even know it existed before finding Guga a couple years ago and now it's my most desired food to try.
Guga is always leveling up
7:12 looks like japanese warrior and his sensei vibes damn!
If we try really hard, we could make this a world record of most watched YouTube in one week/day/month or something.
So many Weber kettles!!! 🥩🍻🍺🥂🍷🥃🚬
The grilling of da a5 wagyu was crazy epic Guga!!! 😊
"______ amount of time until 2st WR" 😆
Oh wow!!! Go Guga!!! Go Matt!!! FOR DA A5 WAGYU!!! 🖤
2st? Lol
My wish came true
Wagyu deserves respect ! Painful to watch 🥲
You dont have to reason
Remember when Guga tried wagyu for the first time?  Look at him now, dude is an actual beast and a legend, you are amazing Guga
I wonder if Gordon Ramsay would like his food
What a waste.
Matt's stomach must be suffering from too much flavor cuz wagyu is very strong lol
2 legends
so awesome, I'm starving...  thanks for the content
One wagyu steak alone is hard to eat. I couldn’t imagine all of that
I'm here for the collab. Thanks for putting me on this channel!!
Guga is doing quite well for himself. Beautiful place
Love you guga, keep on the good work my mans and keep being you! 😁
I can’t be the only person that sees that guga has been hittin the gym. Good for you guga
I’ve never clicked on a video so quickly in my life
SO BAD ASS!
does Guinness recognize these "records"?
Dont ever do this again. I'm not saying this in a funny way either, I'm literally straight faced saying that. This was a new low and I don't understand why you would do this.
waste of Wagyu....you're supposed to eat it slowly so you enjoy it.
Here from matts video
Love what you do guga
Wasteful and disrespectful(to the meat)... Just for the views.. no other gains
*@**4:57** I know a lot of you are thinking Guga, you're crazy!* *Guga: Absolutely!*
Guga I just want a dinner with you man...
Matt send me
Wagyu needs to be eaten slowly and appreciated not wolfing down! A big waste of good steaks!
Dry aging in raw papaya paste just like u did with pineapple
Bro this should have been at least a 30min video! Theres so much more that i want to see in this one..
Guga looks like a mini Brian Shaw haha
have a like lmao
Too bad Matt didn't put that water on the steaks and make high quality 'sloppy steaks from Giovanni's'
MORE collabs like this, not like the previous one
Guga is the Thanos of youtube
Lmao watching this I can’t help but think back to all the times Guga has said “this steak isn’t meant to be eaten in large amounts, it’s an experience”. Awesome collab though
What a waste of meat. America
One time that I had Matt over my home. He ate all of my food.
Wow minde blown
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. GUGA AND MATT STONIE 😱😱😱😱
Haha, what a wild video!
Guga looks like you've been working out or dieting. Good for you!
This is so cool
Crossover that blew my mind now!
New house?
Man I love to see these colabs
Excuse me, is this the vegan channel??
2 of the most humbe people.
I….I think… I think I could beat Matt’s time if you wanna cook me a wagyu guga 😂
I've asked you to give me a slice or 1 steak with no reply, but stoney gets to munch on so many without savouring the flavor
Mattstonie has incredible videos, but let me just say, your cinematography is on another level. Matt's challenge looks so insane through your video
Love my Bay Area boy Matt Stonie
This is the most expensive yet the most entertaining collab with Guga and Matt! Hope to see more collabs in the future! This is EPIC
im so mad there is no legendary quote
"Until 2st WR" ← what is 2st?
Lol why the face diapers??? Are u scared of the flu
bruhh no wayy
Who is here because of Matt’s vid?
it’s crazy seeing literally hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of meat in that one place that’s crazy
and here i am at home eating cheesit's
wow came from matt's video and I'm really happy knowing you exist
h
Good job Guga!!!
I cant afford one steak and i see this guy eat a rack with a tear in my eye. Lol 😢
2 words.... Randy Santel
guga lost 50 pounds from cutting and cooking steaks in this video
I thought my eyes were deceiving me. Clicked hella fast!
I love you both
😆Hey you, wherever you are in the world, if you’re reading this  … be BLESSED by the Creator of all that is  x 1,000,000 😊😊💛💛🙏🙏 😊😊💛💛🙏🙏😊😊💛💛🙏🙏😊😊💛💛🙏🙏😊😊💛💛🙏🙏😊😊💛💛🙏🙏😊😊💛
Finally one video that doesn't end with "and this happened"
Great combo!!!! 🤙
why do you talk like that weirdo
26k likes in a day. Guga es una maquina.
Guga reminds me of Fred Flintstone please say yaba daba doo in your next video
Enough talking; let's dooooo it!
Just let me grill my world famous Fajita del Valle. And kaboom.!!!!
Any chance I can buy one of those SNS grills off you guga? You don’t need that many right? They’re just a little pricey but always wanted one
Leviticus 23:26-32 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God. For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people. Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath. Enjoy the upcoming Day of Attonement. Shalom.
7:16 that picture is amazing
This is taking STEAK VIDEOS to the MOON  What's next BRO !?!?
Screw the meat, I'd be scared to cut my fingers lol. But this is some GOOD content 100%
What a waste.
Total waste for others,i guess it worth it for youtube.(no hard feelings) :)
This is a mix of decadence and stupidity
Speed eating Wagyu is like a frat bro chugging a bottle of 50 year old scotch just to try and impress a 16 year old girl who already has a boyfriend.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
Guga using Matt for views how kosher
Guga! You're an absolute maniac!
cool
fillet mignon : i taste good  Matt : nah Wagyu : hold my fat
Well here i am thinking about ecological responsibility and the waste of Animal Life… i love meat but this is just gross…
Man that looks so delicious. Can you invite to comeover and just eat all the steaks you practiced with? I don’t care rare, medium or well done
We poor are getting satisfied just by watching 🙂
This is probably the coolest collab ive seen in months in years, loved every bit of it
I'm sure you crazy guys had fun.  However, this is not how you eat Wagyu, and even cooking it felt like a fast-food commercial.  Although you picked a nice location for shooting this and I wish I were there.
Why no mask, no social distancing.   Everyone in world gonna die now
Please don't use Wagyu for eating contest.  It looked unappetizing watching a fist full of meat with fatty oil drippings from his hand.
Guga. Broooo. I’ve been watching you for years. So happy and proud of how far you’ve come. Look at you now bro. Collabing with other famous youtubers like Matt and Nick. Seeing things like this makes me super happy for all of you. I had been watching Matt forever too so it’s so cool to see the both of you in the same video! Amazing content. This is definitely one for the books! Saludos desde Chicago. God bless
Best collaboration ever. This is so epic you never fail us guga
Guga, you're a Marvel Superhero.  The shot of you in the center of all the grills going...EPIC!!
Not only is his videes getting better but getting more EPIC as well.
La cara de gaga lo dice todo 08:39 🤣🤣🤣
Damm Guga this was epic much respect saludos🇲🇽🇲🇽
That poor toilet is about to flush a world record
killing it with that Dalstrong man.
He just ate $20.000
Emilio gets $1000/lb for Olive Wagyu?!? I purchased an entire 11lb A5 Miyazaki ribeye (not olive, but still) for $1000 not more than 3 months ago. Hard to believe its a 1000% upcharge for Olive.
Two of my favorite youtubers in one video?!
Guga... The King of Wagyu... The Sultan of Steaks... The Master of Meats!!! All Hail Guga!!!!!!
Next lets wipe our @sses with Gold Leaf.
Speed eating Steaks is absolute Bullshit ...
So sad. I am a meat lover. To see something so great go to waste is just heart breaking. Wasted for some yourube likes. Guga i used to respect you....
We had so much fun practicing with Guga for this event!! Epic video & collaboration with Matt!!
6:35 "Until 2st world record" lmao
Unbelievable
I'm disappointed at the length of this video where's the full video? Where's the other 20/30 minutes?  I would appreciate a longer video for such a title
Congrats on the new records guys!
Guga looks like Bane when he was surrounded by the grills
Gugaaaaaa
I want to see Angel do both challenges
Thanks matt for letting me know about this great channel!! 😍❤️ Good work both.
Its so upsetting to watch somebody do that to such beautiful steak :(
why are these even world records?
Matt Stonie sent me here =)
Collab of the Titans
Диз рекллама гребень)
My boi MATT
Eating competitions are moronic but this is next level  What a waste , when  some dudes are bursting their stomach with cheap processed meat is kinda sad but with Wagyu it’s so absurd it make you think that we might have reach a point of no return as a species
Not going to lie, seeing all these other people eating copious amounts of wagyu makes me mad :(
Looking slim brotha
What an awesome video man - Matt is such a cool dude have watched him for years !!!
His eye brows were punished in this video
This should've been a full fledged documentary my man.
Wish Matt could enjoy those delicious wagyus instead of shoving down his colon. Such a waste.
I can hardly imagine a bigger waist of wagyu
7:15 my eye in tears. That legendary bro 🔥
Anyone else give the thumbs up before watching gugas videos
I am having steak craving lol
I'm sorry Olive Wagyu deserves to be savored and enjoyed.
Next level editing
Looks like you are playing flaming Taiko drums! lol
Awesome colab since I've watching both channels for years!!!  I started watching Matt on his original channel so many years ago and Guga on both of his channels pretty much since the begging!
How’s his heart doing tho?
Matt army ❤️
To think a cow died to go out like that...
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS COLLAB FOR YEARS AND I WAKE HO OUT IF NOWHERE AND SEE IT
One of the worlds greatest combinations, Matt Stonie(A guy who eats alot of food) and Guga(A guy who makes alot of food).
Looked like a lot of fun!
This must be why all the olive wagyu steaks I wanted were sold out, glad that someone scarfed them down as fast as possible without enjoying them.
Stonie and Guga?  Hell yeah!  Careful Guga, Matt might eat you out of house n home, lol
This video is even worse than the one from some days ago, where Guga made wagyu for thos rich kids who fed it to their dog. In fact it might be the worst bbq video ever. Hahaha, funny how this peace of meat costs more than a car, so why not serve it to a guy who just guzzles it in the most ugly way you can imagine without having respect for the meat nor pleasure to eat it. Most people will never be able to eat something like that and that therefor is a slap in their face in my opinion. Why don't you establish a new world record by serving this out to 11 homeless people? I don't think this channel is going the right direction anymore, sensation mongering over the top. I have been watching Guga since many years and liked him actually a lot btw.
guga what do you do for living, narcos? ;>)
Back2Back with Matt!
It’s not the collaboration we wanted, but it’s the collaboration we NEEDED.
Man Guga I absolutely love your videos.  Thanks for doing what you do man.
Nice crossover with matt, that little man can eat so much its insane!
This is too awesome!
I’m in shock nice change of pace and insanely fun to watch
Guga, are you crazy? Absolutely…..!!!💪💪💪👏👏👏
guga is level up the content,love to see it,lesgoooo!
feed my Gugu with your *MEAT*
Interesting channel pivot -- much better than the last one with uhhh, i can't even remember that - bad comment redacted - name.  Edit: After watching Matt's video, and getting perspective on Guga's 'compound' -- I had no idea he lived like Pablo Escobar.
Who would have thought that dana white can slice and cook wagyu for matt stonie..?😅
Madlads did it omg One of the most awaited crossovers
The collaboration I never knew I anticipated.   Felt like I was watching a documentary
Wagyu Olympics
Time for a show on Netflix 😉
Why is he drinking windex?
Yessss!! Love your videos guga. You are one of the coolest people on youtube.
No man, we surely not think that you are crazy. We just love you man. :)
Whoa did not expect this
This was awesome. High quality content!
You should do a Bison steak vs a Guga steak.
This is history right here guys
Man of all the youtubers you could choose you had to go with Matt? He inhales his food.
Awesome!
Dude - I love your channel. But to be honest, thumbs down. This is a complete waste of food and resources. I always assumed your biggest trait is quality.
Two of my fav food channels together
Is angel or mauma (apologizes for spelling) doing the camera shots, they did an amazing job! Top quality content!
I first started watching you in 2018 glad I found your Channel again
What a waste.  1st video i disliked from Guga. And I thought I would see similar comments to mine.  But apparently not.
Guga after watching a lot of Mr.Beast videos
Wow,Guga is just stepping up with every single video!
This is such a stupid video. I don't know why i love it so much!
Watching someone eat olive wagyu like that is a damn shame.
7:16 you guys look like brothers
What location was this filmed? Looks like a beautiful property.
Anyone spotted them baddies? 🥵  Amazing video btw, good work Guga! 😂
You would have thought Guga was the one that does the eating challenge part
no matter what you are doing......YOU ARE ALWAYS HAVING FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now that is what I call a ring of fire
the amount of fat just flowing from the steak 8:32
Hello guys, hey Guga you could've taken Angel to break that steak eating record, hopefully his not mad at you for giving Matt the steaks😂😂😂😂😂😂, awesome videos my brother much love from 🇵🇷
Congrats on 3 million subs guga!
THATS THE MOST STUPID THING I EVER WATCHED *..... MURIKA I GUESS... YALL SO UNHUMAN
I had been subscribed both Guga and Matt Stonie before the collaboration happened.
you tried to look epic but it's nothing epic cutting meat... come on and that waste of wagyu ...
Dude, you’re making wagyu eating disgusting… I am a fan of your channel but this feeding frenzy on the King of all beefs is outrages.. You need to threat it with more respect otherwise the wagyu Gods will come after you;)
Guga try to make cyprus souvla
I came from Matt's channel. Dude's amazing in eating, Guga is Master in what he does. 👊
Everyone watching there must have hoped they could get a bite of wagyu
I still loves when guga tell about his meat dealer than use a word butcher it always put smile on my face and make me laugh 😂
This is soul-crushing…
Fun to but also very painful to watch man.. especially during the eating part..
Matt literally looks like he ate himself into a close coma! xD
Dang guga looked like a complete badass in the middle of all that fire
I like how even though this is a complete different setting, the video clearly shows the bits of the usual theme elements of Guga's videos
The moment when guga was surrounded by flames, looking all serious and badass made me realize how cool guga really is
Must be nice to waste food like that.
Two great channels!
What a waste...
Best combination !!!
Guga took care of that beef better than my parents did of me
I did not expect this crossover.
This is one of the best collaboration ever!
Sooo much drrooollll absolutely amazing congratulations to both of you
This is the only time, i feel waygu look nasty to eat
Straight up waste of food. But I guess consumerism is a cultural issue...
Two of my most favorite people in 1 video, thanks
Now this is a good collab
YEEEEES!!! The collab I didn’t know I needed, but yes, I definitely needed it!
Came here when I saw Matt's video. Props to you sir! Thanks for making this happen.
😛😛😛😛😛😛😛
Timestamp for the epic shot:  7:12
Wow this is my favourite channel. The content is always quality! 😍
Two masters, one wagyu.
I’m going to dislike your video for the first time. Sure you’ve bought the meat and you have a right to do anything you want with it but it hurts watching the best meat in the world gets waisted.
awesome collab :) love the content from both of you guys !
Amazing Collab!
Epic video!
Am i allowed one please??
you're a great guy, New Subscriber here
I still remember your olive wagyu steak that you tried for the first time.. And how much of a disappointment it was.  Hopefully you've tried it again.. And can give us a better review
The collab that I didn't know I needed
this is so mouthwatering
Yessssssss
this is offensive, I cant even afford a single one!!!
this is fked guga, not a good video idea. such a waste of fabulous meat
High level competitive eating is such a disgusting sport.
GUGA, Really good episode. Maybe we'll see you on  the national scene soon. Chef Guga!!! Sounds good!
That was mouth watering on the edge of your seat type stuff. Well worth pausing the movie.
Muchhhh better than the last colab
It be Great for you to invite ''Mikey Chan'' from ''Strictly Dumpling''  for a cook up!
The cutting and grilling was impressive. But what a waste eating them so fast. THEY SHOULD BE ENJOYED AND SAVORED.
Bro I was watching a movie then this popped up, so now the movie is on pause. It's Guga time!
Week 59 of asking Guga to make a steak dry age in bone marrow
Congrats on the World Record Guga
Here from Matt's channel 👋 Awesome footage!
This feels ilegal to watch
Guga content super as always but watching someone eating like that makes me want to vomit it's so gross
So epic!! You and Matt are amazing 😍
man guga, you lost a lot of weight, looking good!
Ah yes the 2st record
It's a SAVAGE 👌🔥🔥🔥🔥👌
Guga can I trade you my two pinkies for a piece of fat off the wagyu?
Been waiting for this video to drop! It was an honor to meet you in La!
Didn't wanna dislike but the number came to 569. I had to🤣
mmann this is the most craziest video ever🔥
Awesome!
A once enjoyable channel that taught great ways to enhance the tastes of affordable foods has evolved into a vulgar display of wasting money and butt kissing of 'influencers'.
@Guga Foods 7:23 is one of best frames i can imagine for steak lovers, for sure best single frame i can imagine. Printing that and puting ona  big canvas for my kichen. Much love.
disgusting, sub deleted
2 Beasts in one video
Guga you are an absolute maniac 3 WORLD RECORDS in ONE video Bro your a legend
The collab of the year
you and matt are both amazing..wonderful work.....i sub to you and i also came from matt's channel..thank you for picking matt
Matt Stonie the hall of famer
Damn, all my favourite Youtubers coming together. WHAT A TREAT Youtube.
This was awesome
This feels disrespectful
What a waste of such a rare and expensive product... there are still millions of people who just have not enough to eat every day and you pressing thousands of dollars in your stomach, to throw it all out a few Moments alter. Disgusting
💥💩
Guga is the Goat!!!
GUGA x MATT STONIE yuhhhh
I'm here on behalf of Matt
Hopefully this video gets suggested to a vegan
I always thought guga was fat.. He looks buff on the thumbnail
Sorry, much love guga but cant watch this one, disturbing lol
The crossover I never expected
Collaboration we’ve been waiting for 😂
If I didn't knew these two, my first guess would be "that smaller guy is the one who sliced the most". That is what it means to never judge a book by its cover.
This is epic!
2 of 3 of my favourite food youtubers together in one video and I loved it.
Guga Food restaurant when? I'm gonna come over from europe to try.
But it’s gray and full of water!
Ok, everything about this challenge was simply epic, both yours and Matt's videos are a solid 10 from me.
0:00
One thing I like about grand western steaks, is that they are cut nice and thick.
Here from Matt’s channel
I am really glad you had the chance to cook all thoses delicious steaks, but i am kinda sad because they where not eaten and enjoyed as they where supposed to be... I mean, it is an enjoyablenpiece of meat that get even better when you share it, because the most important seasoning during a dinner is the smile of your family and / friends  or whohover you are sharing the food with. Thoses 8 steaks where destroyed (amazing performance, don t get me wrong), and so i kinda feel bad for the steaks...
Guga, long time subscriber here. As always, this is an experiment.. to me, it really doesn't seem in-line with the life of the animal, and the amazing things we get from them. Still looking forward to your next videos. Thanks very much!
..give me some
Him cutting steaks looked so unimpressive until I tried to trim a steak “just cut the fat off” and it look me 8 minutes to do 1😭😭😭
I could never .....
Woah you know this collab is gonna be a BANGER!
I don't understand the part about not using charcoal. If you build a high enough grill, the flare ups from the wagyu fat could be high enough to barely reach it and cook it with no problems.
WOW....
This video was so stupid. Should have had a dollar counter ticking while Matt was eating the steak. I loved the video though lol
Awsome, this is epic
what's crazy is that same size of wagyu A5 cut can be found in OK MART, Tokyo (any of their locations) for around $150-$200 only.
What was the cook on them?? They looked medium well
Cant matt eat oit normally ? Like cut it
AMAZING!!!!!
The money shot is in the true essence of the most expensive flames😎
New subscriber ..matt stonia
crossover of the year
I wish I could afford to attempt this record.
Damn 20k grand?
My 2 idols in this one video, making a world record this collab is amazing!!
Finally some fresh content.
my name is Victor
I heard boss music
IMHO freezing your wood board b4 the WR would have helped you cut 3 more steaks.
I ate for a living nice bruh! :)
So Wagyu has finally arrived in the United States, I see.
came here from matts channel to tell you that you are awesome wow that cook looks insane!!!!
Bro this is the most badass thumbnail of history, im 100% sure that if this was a poster id get it
Nice 👍
As awesome as this is seeing Matt not savor the wagyu really hurt my soul 😭😅
Mmm pass me the ranch
Feeding wagyu to this bloke is worthless. He definitely not going to enjoy the texture or flavor.
Guga froze his eyebrows and burnt them in one video
Collab of the century
I love you Guga - I made a comment awhile ago asking for more youtuber collabs like Matt Stonie and you deliver!!! Ty!!! And I see Nick commented on this video - Love it!
This is GOOD content
noooo sorry but you can't do this. i love your channels, i love matt, but this is just insulting to wagyu 😭😭
Top 10 Crossovers in History
Nice
Matt sent me here! New sub!!
great collab
Your content is getting crazy good
THIS IS A COLAB I NEVER KNEW I WANTED!!!
The crossover event I didn't know I needed. This was EPIC!
When will Guga visit Kobe, Japan?
Next video, “most dry aged steaks cooked at once”
Coming from Matt's channel, subbed it
"Sometimes I don't know how it fits in there" that's what she said!!!
Guga's laugh at 9:03 kills me 😭
Guga looked badass on those grills
What a waste of good meat for eating it fast 😅
Guga, you're crazy
Getting close to three mil 👀
And then matt stonie obliterated 8 of those 1lb wagyu steaks in 5 minutes
Be honest when you have a delicious food you search food channels am I right
Matt brought me here. This is dope!
This is the king of meat
This video has to blow up.
If your wrist hurt then you’re doing it all wrong. Gotta let the knife do the work.
The Most Amazing Collab Ever
2st world record  lol
Not gonna lie seeing Matt shovel down meat like that was a like unsettling
Absolutely digging the compilations!
angel vs matt steak eating contest
The thumbnail is 🔥🔥
Guga in the circle of expensive flares, Best cooking shot ever!! Matt is a beast, like literally a beast
that man got to experience something noone ever will
Lol gugas face seeing stonie not even taste the steak and gulping it down is priceless lol
From Matt video and subscribed too
Guga: "im gonna bring a few knives"        *brought a machete*
these guys are like the avengers getting together haha good collab
Wait, Guga actually has legs? Sam The Cooking Guy said Guga had no legs, lol.
a friend saw this and thought guga was the eater and matt was the cook xD
Mattttt
Go Matt!
My dream is to try Guga's Wagyu steaks!
Damn Guga Foods and Matt Stonie dream collab!
Bro your collabs are going crazy lately
Look how far guga have become. So proud of you G
This is Guga’s home!? What’s that place with the normal backyard he’s usually at?
How will you TOP this?
Whoa dude, two of my favorite YouTubers collaborating 🤩
Hope they had a cardiologist on hand...
🔥🔥🔥
damn.
My two favorite food related YouTubers/food people!!
Someone got to eat that much wagyu just to see how fast they could do it. I bet Angel is big mad 🤣
Can I get one of those used SNS grills please
Guga is stepping up his content
Great collab
3:15 from the freezer practicing to slice to the grill to cook.
such a waste of good meat when the eating isn't enjoyed
Hey Guga. Love your channels. But this was gratuitous.  I mean...there was no respect for the ingredients.  This is not the Guga/Sous Vide style. Stay classy my man.
Matt and Guga. Best collab this year!!! This is great!!
What a legend
I love you Guga
The collab we didn't ask but it's worth it
Matt had to be so sick after that! Waygu is so rich
Me: Guga you crazy Guga: Absolutly
Guga, you are awesome!
Now all he has to do is make a  Most Sous Vide or Most Dry Age World Record and it would be perfect
yo like if you would like to see a guga and Gordan Ramsay collab
Guga... are you losing weight? You look like you are. I think that challenge made you skinnier.😆    Great job & congratulations on those new world records, amazing!! 👊👏🏼👍🏼
Let's  go
That's a actually some sick moment, surrounding urself with cooking wagyus
Guga making fun of his obedient serfs yet again - Avec Couleur
This has to hit like 500 mill views
If there's anyone who can set these world records, it's the king of wagyu himself. Congratulations.
🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🤤
Guga this is one of your best video....i mean those flare shots are so freaking awesome... have to.say it hurt in my soul seen those steaks been eaten like that .. its like adding cola to blue label...  You should colab with Pitmaster x
Matt Stonie and wagyu steaks? That is one extremely expensive restaurant tab.
Open a restaurant, Guga Steakhouse!
Guga lost weight nice
Hell yeah!!  Emilio hooked me up with a discount code on one of the $999 A5 picanha's that took about $150 off!!!  Have only eaten 3 of the 10 steaks I got from it, (with friends& or family of course) got five 1-1½" steaks from the thicker side and five ¾-1" steaks towards the tip, then scraps from trimming for burgers or whatever.  one of the best purchases I've ever made lol
Guga has been kicking it with a few youtubers lately. Will we see a collab with a certain Canadian?  "Order 69, orders up my guy."
this is so stupid
put Guga on that new forged in meat History channel contest show, the butcher or whatever.
What a great video collaboration!!! Loved this, two favorites together
CIRCLE OF FIRE !!!     TEAM SNS
Oh my ghad
This is why Terrorists hate us…
What a waste of good food being barbarically consumed
It looks like guga is cooking for ancent army at war
U A MAD MAN GUGA
*Here after watching matt*
Came from Matt Stonie😂
I really like Guga, but this video passing as entertainment is just over the top bad taste.
The Bum Azz Leech Nephew Angel must be foaming from his mouth right now
Now this is the type of guga collab I've been waiting to see! No more collabs with fools feeding their dog wagyu!
Way to go Guga well deserved brother
2 leyendas!!!! Y ahora que??? Cr7 y Messi jugarán en el mismo equipo???🤯🤯🤯🤯
Oh my god this is like a dream come true, like my two fav YouTubers
This is just you practicing for when you open your restaurant
They were world records because they are too expensive for any challengers lol
Matt brewing a 10,000 dollar turd and wondering what is about to happen to his body. “Uncharted territory.” Hilarious.
He must have gotten so sick!!! Wagyu has such a high fat content. I had a some in Tokyo and had bad poops later! All the fat can mess you up! Looks delicious tho. Congested Guga!
Like, respect to you both, but I feel like steaks like these shouldn't even be eaten like that. Shoving olive wagyu doesn't sit well with me if I'm honest.
life isn't fair
Man guga’s been hitting us up with some great content lately
A one hundred dollar piece of A5, takes my family of four and I about a half hour to consume. This is insane lmao
Me wondering when u and matt going to collab again
MATT STONIE SENT ME ")
Freaking awesome
Guga is my mentor , i learn to cook a steak because of him
15k like? come on guys give him more
8:28 its literally as if hes munching down on 1 steak like a caveman
I never knew I needed these two to collaborate, this is great.
If there had been 10 minutes on the clock instead of 5.. I think Matt would have finished off all 14 steaks! But 8 rich af Olive Wagyu in 5 minutes was still beyond epic! Great collab.
Nice
He ate a whole wagu cow
The first two I get, but the third seems like a waste
I couldn't help but notice that Angel and Maumau weren't there. Are they being dry aged for your next video?
a combo i never seen coming but quite the amazing duo
I don’t like any of this.
Guga... you are insane, Bro !!! AND Matt is an eating machine... WTF !!!
:0
4:58 the summary
Amazing Collab ❤️❤️❤️ my two favorite channels in one video, AMAZING 🥰
Guga after 1 bite of wagyu. *stop for a while to express the richness and tenderness of the meat.  Matt: ......... start the timer.
He ate a house
Coming from Matt's this was awesome
this video was insane proportions, i wish it was longer and showed BTS
This video better go crazy viral
Hurts to see wagyu eaten like this 🥲
probably the most badass guga has looked in a video
Sorry guys, this seems like an overly decadent challenge given the carbon footprint of the meat industry and how many people will never be able to taste such cuts.
Yo Guga seriously is an absolute beast of an uncle.
Guga the GOAT
This collab was awesome!! Im always happy to see familiar faces collab with each otther, especially when I love guest persons channel too. For ex. like the one you did with chef Hiro, this made my day too! wish you all the best
This is the best collab 😁
Love thw Collab! Matt and guga a match made in heaven!
Me when guga buys the rarest steak and inflate the price buy 200%
A video with homard bleu(blue lobster) would be cool to see
These collab videos have been absolutely amazing Guga ur the best creator and possibly the greatest steak cooker alive
Noo wayy this is a video I HAD TO WATCH. 2 of my favourite youtube dudes ❤
By far my favorite video you brought in the most underappreciated eater. Yeah Stonie!!!
love you guga
AMAZINGGGGGG
this is the first time i saw guga driving a car
This is the collab we need
Hopefully 1 day I will be able to afford a bite of one of these :'(
Guga is doing some EpicMealTime 2.0 stuff.
Wagyu is so rich. How Matt ate all that wagyu meat is beyond me.
Just sous vide the steaks then they can all be don't at once lol
I think....come on!!! This is so so so so stupid....why they have to do this? Why are this even legal it is just like suicide contest. And Guga I think you're better than this...come on man...
The tenderness I’m sure helped Matt a lot
It looks like a battle scene when you were cooking the steak
This was an awesome video, Guga is a monster, and matt is also a beast. Probably the most expensive youtube video ever uploaded
What a damn collab
Great collab. Love seeing Matt doing stuff and it’s mindblowing that you cut $60,000 in prep alone
Wagyu Fu
I got some of the A4 ms 5+ and I’m ngl, it was awesome. I can’t even eat normal steak anymore. Next time I’m getting A5, keep up the good work Guga!
The Guga vid I had to close midway during breakfast, remembering who Matt was 😂.
Love this channel but sometimes fame makes you foolish. Everyone of your subs watch your channel for the experience to watch you cook and eat a meat that not many can afford. I am one of them. but thats ok still enjoy you. I have been subscribed since before you had sponsors and the lord knows everybody usually cancels subs when that happens. My point is, to see you do what you do, and one other famous youtuber solo eating all that food and money to set a record makes me sad. Most of us can't afford to buy wagyu. I prob could spring for some but I would share it with my family like you do. But today just rubbed me the wrong way. The world is hungry for food not fame and money,, only the Greedy want that. but money and ads and sponsors make the world go round. Live long and Prosper YouTube.
Not surw which part is harder.
This is the unexpected anime crossover. 🤯
💪🏼❤Congrats gugaaa on your world records!! And matt stonie definently a beast!💪🏼
Seeing Matt eating those steaks that way almost made me cry...
Why do I feel Salt Bae had all 3 previous world records.
The collab we all didn’t know we needed.🔥🔥
cool vid man
Pro Tip: cut from right to left
What a feast to watch 👍❤️
Merica!
Now this was a colab sorry but that last one.......... F.
I love Guga but this was an extreme waste of food.
Matt Stone is going to be pooping good….
I want one of those grills 🤤🔥
I like your SNS barbecues. You have a lot of them.  I need to get me one.
Where can I taste the incredible quality of authentic wagyu? I would love to try it one day but have no idea where to get it .. somewhere that cooks it for you of course lol (in the USA)
Love this! Just wish it was longer lol
came from matt stonie's channel, now I'm a fan <3
All-in-one epic video it is
Came from stonies channel, awesome videos here
Oh wow so awesome! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
First uncool Guga video. I love how he cooks  steaks to perfection and tastes them. But this is video is abomination of cooking and waste of great meat. What’s next, speed drinking 100 year old Bordeaux wine?
Great content even greater steaks 🥩
Legendary collab
Matt Stone brought me here 😂 ✌️
Both of gugas channels are my top favorite hes the real deal you can't get enough of it haha
That's insane 👏!!
Matt sent me.
are they sns grills
You started from humble beginnings and look how far you have come. Congrats Guga!
Disgusting and what a waste of waygu. Could have fed a bunch of homeless hungry people.
7:18 What Benihana chefs dream of becoming on their day off.
The biggest crossover of all time.
I felt like I was watching survivor 💀
Nice collaboration!!👍👍😁
what the hell am I watching!?!? this is amazing
Damn bro, me and my buddy were just mimicking guga last night on the phone while throwing back some beers 🍻  "LeTs dO iT" 😂 🤘🙌✌ congratulations on the records brother 👌
I love this collab, the world records are amazing. Probably many don't have the skills nor money to break them XD
THIS IS LEGENDARY!
It's really cool to see Guga doing more collabs! Can we get a Sam the Cooking Guy x Guga collab? 🙏
Masks while you were grilling? Then eat very expensive steak like and pig that so few can even afford.  sorry - ah, no thumbs down
Did not expect this collab, but tbh its makes alot of sense
Absolutely Beautiful👍
Disgusting! What’s the point of “respecting” the steaks by cutting them properly if you’re gonna have a pig chug them down!? Might as well use a fukn axe!
I had a big smile watching two of my favorite Youtubers.  Wish this was an hour long.
The crossover we didn't know we needed
Damn my 2 favorite youtubers in one vid.,, This is lit🔥
The collab we never asked for, but the one we needed
I watched Matt stonie's video first. Gugas is amazing
Guga: oh no all my meats are expiring  Matt: say no more
Matt stonie isn't an emo weirdo anymore, still can't stand him so won't be watching the video
Congrats Guga, amazing job!
Yess!! finally the collaboration I have been wanting to see!!!
angel pov : Man i wish a was matt
Guga get your health into check brother you are gaining weight and I don't think it is healthy.
Aw man.  guga still the champ but what a waste and that was gross hard too watch
Sana all
The collab we didnt even know we needed
Ridiculous
Guga is finally going across the country, and showing prefesionalism, that he perfected in the comfort of his home.
Getting worse and worse… Please come back to special recipe… Don’t waste Wagyu…
I like content like this occasionally. It actually shows that other high profile parties are taking notice of Guga which gives him credibility. I don't think this this was the case with Guga but anyone can make a video of themselves making some food and tell their family/friends "ok say this is REALLY good to the camera". This kinda stuff goes to show that Guga really is legit
Guga, this was gluttonous and wasteful. That meat is meant to be enjoyed and savored
AWESOME COLLAB GUGA
Nice! I'll bet Angel is pissed... lol!
Matt's belly and bowels are going to be bugging him for days after this
coolest guy in the world! seems down to earth and always positive.  Been watching since couple thousand subs and it just gets better. Wishing you all the best in life!
Guga and Matt on the same team... This is the colab I didn't know I needed and it's so good. Cooking for a living and Eating for a living on the same team... this should be a thing!
Guga is like the Dana White of steaks
EPIC.
It should absolutely be a CRIME to cook a5 like that.    Look at 'em! Theyre all curled up, lots of burn spots, way over cooked.   Congrats on the record but please dont do that again guga  :)
I’ve never seen Guga so focused !!!!
The collab we never knew we needed
What a waste of beautiful steaks.
O maaaan what a experience! New subscriber I liked tons!
Those are three really expensive world records lmao
It's disrespectful to eat Wagyu that way.
~~Man Guga, it would've been more like 20 had you just continued cutting w/o having to hand-off each one?
That's such a waste of a good wagyu...
An unexpected collab, but a welcome one.
Yoooo Guga! Love how much your channel is growing, all the collaborations, and most of all, love to see all the food! Noice! Also The cinematic of the steaks being cooked is one of the best things i have ever seen in my life, brings a tear to ones eye.
Matt Stonie sent me here. You got a new subscriber.
Better than avengers 4
The moment he started eating the steaks- so epic 😅
bruh moment
Mfs in these comments acting like wagyu is their religion and this video is sacrilege.
What a feature my god!
"Infinity war is the most ambitious crossover event in history" Guga: hold my dry age bag
Worst guga video ever!!! Steaks looked horrible!!!! Guga trying to colab to try and get more viewers is ruining his style of cooking and the content of his channel! Keep it classy brother
Wtf is a 2st
Two of my favorite youtubers greatest collab in recent memory
This video insults me on a personal level. Guga's portion was fantastic, but wasting such precious meat like that? Deplorable.
E.P.I.C.
I’m so sorry. I had to stop watching as soon as he started eating them… I just can’t watch those stakes get pulverized like that…
Hahaha I never expected to see you doing a colab. Awesome.
This is the dumbest video we've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
holy shii the collab i waited ;-;
Is unbelievable seeing you two together! Its a mega powers level union!
Man I with that amount of money I could afford to go to college for a whole year and a half
What a legendary collaboration of two amazing channels as well as people!!
Incredible focus, and performance
Hxjff
Guga's taking the tittle "god of barbeque"
Yay, an actually good collaboration
Instant like @5:01
This feels illegal..
This is realll epicccccc🔥🔥🔥 congratssss from vietnam
Been waiting for this colab for yearsss <33
Wagyu is so rich in flavor, it's absolute insanity to eat so much in one go.  Way to go on a truly epic video 🙏💕
Two of my favorite Food-Tubers in one video? Hell yeah!
Matt is a legend! And the luckiest guy alive on that day! I would kill for one of those steaks
Yes the collaboration I was waiting for
Awe man I felt my cholesterol go up watching this .
From cooking sous vide in his regular work office to cooking for multi-millionaire  youtubers and beating world records. I think I can say I speak for all of us when I say we are so proud of you Guga! So happy your years of efforts lead you to this! Hopefully, this is just the start!
The amount of fat matt just ate. His stomach must have killed him
who else came here from Matt's channel?
Watching Matt just destroy like 20g's worth of Wagyu, honestly just hurt my soul. More so because i dont believe i will ever have the chance of tasting wagyu :(
Awesome collab! Been a big fan of Matt & you for a while now. Great job 👍🏼
I don't imagine there's been many people to ever try to do any of this specifically with wagyu. I guess you could say the steaks aren't that high.
Waste of wagyu
Would like to a run off of steak cutting with Guga and The Bearded Butcher!
Guga looked like Bane
Matt just ate more wagyu beef in a few mins than most of us will in our entire lifetime.
Yo bro! Proud yiu guys can meet together!!! I watch Matt so many times and so guga too!!! Thank you so much
If you can't eat to enjoy, especially something like Wagyu, don't bother.  Not giving this waste of wagyu a like.
Didn't know Guga was a SpaceX  fan, his wall looks like Starship TPT.
Great recipes, enjoy the art of cooking whit family and friend, bring to them the best of the market because you love them. But hey, how much expensive mest you can cut? How much 1 person can eat? Thars ridicoulus. Anoying. Not the way.
Guga should invite Furious Pete. He would eat that little guy...
Dry Age the A5 brisket
hell yes
W T F.
Definition of gluttony
Absolutely amazing.
Not a fan of wasting food like that tbh
Awesome stuff Guga
I came from the Matt Stonie channel
Bro, he was stacking up that Wagyu A5 like carne asada  o.o
Day 1 of asking for wagyu tartare       pls respond
This is so wholesome and cute the intro with Matt is killing me.
Fun to watch but a waste. I like my steak at 1.5 to 2 inches.
*cries*
Finally the moment they both together 💕💕💕
I love Matt, peace ✌
Man the glow up is insane 💪💪💪
Not watching. This is disgusting. Wagyu commands more respect. Leave this to normal steaks.
sheeeesh
Guga you have to do a collaboration with deer meat for dinner!!!!!
why does he look like a villain 3:54
Crazy collab
Crazy how mat just ate 20k like nothing lmao
What a waste of awesome meat 🤦‍♂️
Waste of money.... SMH
That was crazy! Awesome video
THIS is the kind of Collab I will thumbs up!
Damn Guga you've been callabing alot
Never a fan of such kind of eating, waste of food, no good to the body neither
How is this not trending?
Soooooo…how many did he eat?
Now THIS is premium stuff
Loved this collab a lot!!!!
Man.... us folks on this channel would die for just one of those steaks, it feels like a waste watching this.
2 legends in one video
🔥
I love that ur doing collabs now Guga, please hit up William Osman and do Guga vs the BBQ Bot or something. I would love to see u and the tech youtubers do something it would be EPIC!
Ngl great colab! This video had a certain "Epicness" about it. Loved it!
Premium Content. Just the title got he hyped.
That was an expensive challange
Guga went home and cried after watching Matt eat the steaks like that
Found your channel from recommendations when watching Stonies a couple months back. Awesome Collab, instantly clicked! Would love to see some more world records by you guys!
I'd tear up eating/swallowing that wagyu so fast T-T
I absolutely love this
Came here from mattstonie, insane collab keep up the great work
This is movie quality!!!!!!  Legends
I love that you're finally collaborating with other big channels! Keep growing, you deserve it!
This is dope.  I bet guga had a blast learning all these new techniques and handling so much expensive meat.
Huge Matt stonie fan and huge guga foods fan to!!
only people who ever went to be the designated BBQer at a neighborhood event with 100+ visitors know how this feels it's hard work! the bonus you are the first taster! I once multi grill at my exposal served 1000 folks!
lets be real, who could've possibly gotten these world records other than guga and matt
Revolting.
That's quite a specific world record...
Guga will be a legend to his grandkids man you already are a legend but imagine the stories people will tell!
Food wars moment
8:23 is me when the waiter pulling up with my food
Just acknowledge the amount of money that this challenge cost. It should be a world record for the most costly food eaten too
guga is not mentioning those steaks are half frozen!
Just came from Matt's video. I was already subcribed to both of you but i came here immediately to see how this challenge was prepared.
What’s with all the masks
Matt could eat Guga and still look like Matt. Wut dis men made of?
are these guiness world records?
You should have heated your knife before cutting wagyu steaks
My type of challange is to not die of hunger untill my mom comes home
when you showed wagyu could be not only safe to consume raw when you have a good dealer I went mad with it. my cousin is a butcher and importer of great products including wagyu of all grades for local restaurants to richer individuals he delivers but, sometimes a deal does not go through or is faulty well, yeah! then there's leftover meat! and I get to try some!...lucky me!
Gordon Ramsay: "THAT IS BURNT"
Stonie and Guga is EPIC!
Fala, Guga! Poderia aproveitar que o Corbucci esta por ai para fazer colab com ele tb, o conteudo de churrasco ta crescendo pra caramba no Brasil graças ao tiktok!! Abraços <3
Please guys. Not worth it. Not at all. I love ur channels stonie and guga. But this time u dont respect the animal, the quality of the meat and I liked every of ur videos but this is a rude and shameless clickbait. I am sorry guys. Dont delete this comment plz
Love this colab!!!
Matt's eating a brand new car now
Am I the only one who feel offended as a human being by this video?
Matt Stonie and Guga… Two of my favorite food you tubers collaborating. I love it.
The only 2 food channels(3 if you count gugas second channel) that I regularly follow joined up. Well done guys.
Epic Collab!
Finally
I love the is video style 🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
Really cool!
Pfft if Guga is gonna do speed-eating videos he should just launch a new channel called "Guga Chews"
Do a house tour guga
That was nuts. If it were me I would have eaten that steak like a gentleman. Just saying I'd love to have it but its sooooo expensive. Great video, i'm jealous.
That's the biggest waste of waygu I've ever seen.  It was awesome but I'm sad that I can't get waygu where I live in Canada.
Did not expect this kind of vid, and im not disappointed.
These colabs are insane! Keep it going.
guga lookinf straight like a badass sumtimes
Here from Stonie!!!
Guga was crazy when he dry aged beef in MSG, this is a whole new level of craziness :)
Matt looks like a mushroom and guga looks like an egg
one of the best collabs ever. you both killed it!
thank GOD Guga you had that mask on , with all that heat around you COVID would kill you FOR SURE
Watching someone stuffing their face with food and someone judging them . And im watching it…
Top 10 anime crossovers
I feel like I could watch a whole movie about Guga and Matt winning these challenges
Guga and Matt are making history right there!
matt should try and cook a perfect steak and guga will try to finish it fast like under 40 sec
Hank Hill does not approve. Taste the meat, not the heat my dude.
YESSIR
guga i thought u guys did web design before youtube wtf u got a mansion 👀👀 youtube payin well or what
Let’s go guga drives a ram
Matt Stonie, Guga and Nick in the comments.... this is crazy🤯
To me this's all an execuse to ritual summon the legendary Wagyu A6. Poor Matty bout to get dry-Angeled...🙏😬
Best collaboration this year. Congratulations on your records!
I’m so pumped for all these collabs guga’s been doing lately
I wish I was the local mutt living in that park!
Hey look it’s Joey chestnuts sidekick
very kool saw matts video congrats to you both on where you gotten in life...............
this is so epic
Literally my 2 favorite channels
the best..!
You are crazy, in a good way!!👍💪
This is an epic feature Guga. Keep up the videos man. Can definitely get behind having more features in the guga foods series.
3:52 what an epic shot of guga!
When Guga stood in the middle of all the grills, he truly became the KING Of All STEAKS!! (As if he wasn't already)
This man guga was having the time of his life watching matt down those steaks🧐😂😭
That was awesome!
Dropped a follow coming over from Matt’s Channel 👇🏼
Matt's stomach will be feeling sick the next day.😥That is just way too much fat to consume in one sitting.
My favs
here from matt stone
It is desecration to eat those steaks like this.
11 wow. 😳
do you live in a giant mansion!??!
What a wasted of good steak....
When a waggu cow sees guga. It hides.
I don’t know why but seeing Matt eating the steaks like that hurt me.
Nooooooooo!
This was collab I should have seen coming but never even considered. Today is a great day.
Awesome Collab! Matt is insane!
Guga has a nice Compound!
Best collab!
Unsubbing for this one. Not interested in watching a massive amount of money invested in a video like this while people are struggling to feed there families. Best of luck in the future.
Congratulaciones
Two legends🥲
This was so epic OMG
I feel like im watching avengers after years of solo flim we have the aliens invading   Thats how epic it is after years of guga experimenting in his office or house to meeting up with others in epic style
Yessssssssss
i dont know bro... i eat steak for pleasure not like that
🤤
❤️
a good way to waste wagyu, saying with no respect, I am mad when watch this video
This video and was epic and collab was legendary!!! Made my day.
I'm subbed to both of you. I wasn't expecting this! This is awesome!
This is obscene.
wow the production that goes into this! Cant believe this is just a youtube video. looks like a freaking documentary on the TV
THREE world records in ONE video. This is YouTube premium people.
This is a waste of good Steak, i dont like it
Here from Matt Stonies page, wow LOVED this video! You both rock! 🔥🔥🤙🤙
One of these days ( I Hope ) I'll get a chance to try Wagyu. Amazing collab, would love to see a Matt Stonie vs Guga family eat off. Like most steak ounces consumed Matt vs Guga Family lol.
NO WAY!  GUGA AND MATT !!! MY DAY IS MADE!
e se voce tivesse cortando em um tapete com pregos pra evitar escorregaçao
An eating contest is the first step in a shitting contest!
Been subbed to both channels this was definitely bound to happen 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Awesome collab with two of my fav youtubers!
MATT ARMYS HERE..❣
I’m sorry but this is a gross miss use of olive Wagyu. It’s not something to just throw down your gullet and mow down on like it’s a piece of regular meat. This is why when the Japanese cook it in the homeland they treat it with so much care and are very attentive while cooking. If this is truly what you claim it to be then I would not just be feeding it to a dude who won’t even get to really enjoy it.   But we always had to Americanize everything and make it stupid. I wish the Japanese kept their prizes  to meet in their homeland. Face palm
My man literally played Overcooked irl
Guga, do blueberry dry aged meat
I have to ask why do you have the knife and your left had so close together when you are cutting a steak? Why not hold the bulk side?
meanwhile im over here eating a burger king patty :/
Amagine The Meat Sweats After That . 🤣
You see this? This is guga’s career peaking
I could never eat that much Wagyu in one sitting. Four oz. is enough to send my digestive system into a full-on freakout. So much fat. Delicious, delicious fat.
I watch both these channels like every day. Did NOT SEE THIS COMING BUT I'M SO GLAD ITS HAPPENING.
Guga has to be dying inside seeing how this guy eats a expensive cut and good as wagyu A5
we want an angel vs mao mao  HAHAHAAHA
Matt is a LEGEND! I've seen that man eat many times, he's insane
Tremendo crossover papá!!!
Dude those steaks are not cut like they are in restraunts. The fat needs to be cut off. You also didn’t mention how were they cooked. Medium? Medium rare or well done.
Your videos are getting crazier and crazier. So entertaining.
That whole neighborhood is going to smell like Wagyu for weeks
I'm gonna send this to all the vegans out there
Yes! This collab was needed!
Nice collab.
I don't want be friend with Matt and pay $8,000 for dinner :D
Guga did you make a new World Record with your cuts?
I couldn’t ask for a better collab
Great collab, love you both
Cross over of the century!
Ffff
For 3 million followers, do a house tour!
Dude these collab videos are absolutely incredeble! Keep doing it.
Me: What a waste of Wagyu Beef  Sponsors and Youtube clicks per video algorithm : Shut up
2 of my favourites.... Collabing  PORRA CARALHO 🙏✊🏽🙏🏼💪🏽
🤯🥳🤩❤️‍🔥
This is a master piece!!!
Guga goated
The Steak God and Eating God TOGETHER
damn
Dudes challenge.
I just realized why Guga constantly says his steaks are hard to get. It's because he buys up the entire supply.
Such a waste
Video was fire but you could’ve done 12 in one minute you quit!!
Me: Likely never going to be able to afford eating a Wagyu steak.  Whoever The Hell Matt Stone Is:  Double-fisting Wagyu like it's happy hour at a Buffalo Wild Wings.
Cooked nearly 2 steaks a minute, holy cow..
Day 283 of the comment section trying to get guga to have angel and maumau to have a steak cook off
Great job Matt! 🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩 Also good job Gaga Foods!
came from matts channel. Cook for the gods this guy is
Guga as a kid: *walks down street* Meat Dealer: Hey kid, you want some A5 Olive Wagyu Steak?
Best video Guga has ever uploaded?
The King of eating and the King of grilling
2st
This man is a beast
Not the collaboration we expected, but the collaboration we needed
Amazing collab!!!
*Gets to Emilio's Location*  (Slams on the desk) "Give me Emilio." (Goes to the back room) "Emilio, my brother, *scratches hand* you got what I need?" (Emilio looks to the sides) *Slides him Wagyu stakes*
Wow nice job Guga!
Dam Guga i can barely handle 1 grill when im cooking some Diesmillo asada! You are a beast bro! Great video man!
Say Whaaaaaaaat! My two FAVOURITE channels collaborating. Awesome video guys! Much Love from New Zealand
Saw NOTHING,  only one bite.
So nice to see those guys collab...
😋🤙
I liked this colab so much better than the last one. The last one felt like Guga was just hired by a bunch of rich kids to make them steak and he made a cringe video of it.
What a waste
I think guga is done with the main quest for steaks and just doing side quest lol
2st
From cooking Turkey in an office to breaking world records with Wagyu. That's channel growth.
So when is Guga's pop-up opening? Supper clubs are all the rage these days.
Here from matts channel. Legendary  collaboration
New subscriber Matt sent me over here
I really liked your channels. But i have to say goodbye. Don‘t enjoy that kind of content.
What a waste of quality food :(
clicked fast lmao
I'd say grilling would be the worst way to cook that steak...gentle sear on flat top is best for the fats. Crazy!
Guga your biggest challenge cook Kangaroo meat!
matt
Guga's face when Matt was chomping on the steaks. His face was like "wagyu isn't supposed to be eaten that way".
Guga is a beast at cooking
Pure crazy. My mind is blown. So rich is right. Coming from a guy that only has money to buy choice chuck meat for dinners. I just want to cry. 😥
This colab makes me so happy
Man that's one expensive video
Next session with furious Pete!
Disrespectful to the waygu to shuv it down the throat
Angel can eat faster than that.
This video hurts my soul, waste of good wagyu steaks
Nice
A video like this should be unedited. Let us see everything even if it takes a couple hours.
Speed-eating wagyu feels like it should be a crime.
oh meeen.... this is LEGEND.. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wagyu and Matt stone is like straight up cash getting burned by a lava pit
Okay
Guga reminds me of Majin Buu as a baby.  Just always happy.
This was better than the last video. I actually wanted more time with the western butcher to learn more about wagyu. Cool collab and it was Elmore about food that your last one. Not my type of content but it looks fun.
All that protein is making guga look jacked
I’m loving the collabs lately
who paid for all this?
GARDEN. TOUR.
This was a great collab!  Two of my favorite youtubers in one video!
We didn’t ask for this but im not complaining this is one of his best videos
Ever since Guga signed with Matt’s social media management company, I knew this was coming. Great work 👍
Well done you guys!!!😀😀😀
that's just disgusting how he eats such a special meat.
Cool record but man , eating this stuff this fast is a sin
Bro you have to do a Collab with Corbucci Eats.
Épico, me suscribo.
I'm out. No ill will to you for your success. I just have grown tired of the constant product promotions.
Title says three world records. Ide like to correct that, it's actually 4. The fourth is Matt will take the most expensive dump ever.
That challenge's cost could buy a freaking house.
What kind of Kettle is that??? Doesn't look like a Weber? Anyone know please let me know
What a waste and disrespectfull use of steak.
This video is beyone legendary.
Amazing video Guga. Keep it up!!!
Irr after matt vid 👍🏾
Guga vids always pop up when I'm hungry af...thank alot lol 😆
Wagyu Flex 💪
Direct came here after  Matt stonie's video
Noo way!!!
Hahahah. “I know a lot of you are thinking Guga you’re crazy.” Guga: “Absolutely “.
💪🏼🔥
Amazing collab!
Trust me, American Wagyu beef is really good.  American Wagyu is excellent as a cheap alternative to Japanese Wagyu.   American Wagyu is 50% Wagyu genetics and 50% US beef
Your vids lately...bad.  Imagine being a Wagyu Cow that is raised with care just to be friggin huffed down by some YT comp. eater??? and not savored. This is really, very Sad. The channel is changing for the worse.
What a stupid waste. This is so american
Here from the collab Guga looks like a awesome guy Think I’m gonna like this chabnel
NOW THIS is some effing Guga content and that's why I have internet. Jesus I can't  believe the dude ate more money converted to meat in 5 minutes than I have in my entire life. Just to put into perspective, if you were in Brazil you could eat 1kg (a little more than 2 pounds) a day of picanha for almost 3 years.
Insanee!
That's not the way to eat wagyu....
Man the filming and editing was so good. Love the slow mo of you two standing with all the fire from the grills around you. Makes it look so cool when it must have been so hectic lol.
Wow
I wasn’t expecting this collab but damn this was nice
This video was freaking epic...
More in the future please. You and matt are my two favourite food content creators
This has nothing to do with properly cooking up prized food and enjoying it. Disgusting.
1:15  Guga: *started from the bottom now we way up*
Who came after matt's video 😍
Guga also holds the world record for most legendary chef
8:39 Gugas face says it all
i dont know whats more crazy, guga grilling all the steaks at the same time or matt stonie eating 8 steaks in 5 min
To be honest, what a waste of wagyu. Matt didn’t even taste the damn thing, wagyu is to be enjoyed, not scarfed down into oblivion like that. It’s nothing but First World gluttony. Anyway. Who paid the bill? Matt or Mr Guga?
When 2 giants collab..... pure beauty  Seriously though amazing work. That's a small fortunes worth of waygu and to be able to cook all of that at once perfectly is worth the sub alone. Great job to both of you!
Day 4 of asking guga to do the most expensive meatball sub
Yes
Feels great when I see different YouTubers collaborating for videos
Great video colab! I love it! Although it hurt me to watch him eat it so fast. 😭
midem bulandı ya
Guga hands down respect!!! Good job done and congratulations on your records 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Here from Matt’s channel. Never heard of this channel but I’m glad I know now! New subn
Why do you have to do this with wagyu ? 😐
Alot wagyu!!🔥😋🤤🤤
Not the collab we deserved but one we needed
How is it possible that ive never ran across this channel before this collab. Insta sub'd.
Matty got biceps on his cheek even bigger than my biceps 😎
NO WAY,  A COLLAB WITH TWO OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS!
How can you let someone disrespect wagyu like that Sad
Speed eating is disgusting 🤢
W
Who's here after matt stonie is vid?
Jesus loves yall so much
When do we get the Babish Collab?
To see him eating wagyu like this makes me really really really (...) sad, it's even more sad that you took on this challenge cause you sometimes talk about responsibility and sustainability and then we watch this.. sorry bro but i just can do the thumbs down on this one cause i never thought you would do something like this - i'm really really really (...) disappointed.
Epic!!!! The back to back shot with Matt and you looking out from inside the circle of grills was awesome.
Wagyu should be eaten slowly and enjoyed. Speed eating it is pointless.
This is some MrBeast level content 💖
Biggest and unexpected collab ever no cap.
The thumbnail is insane though lol. I thought the mikey chen/matt stonie collab was epic, but this... 😍🔥👏🏻
Legendary collab right here!!
YES! Way better collaboration than last time!
Can you dry age a wagyu a5 brisket and then cook it in a microwave
Guga is all about that fancy youtuber life now
6 steaks wasn't it? how much in money is that???
Legit
This could easily have been a 40min documentary.
This was like watching Ferraris compete in a demolition derby 😆
There aint much competition in the wagyu steak cutting championships :D Wish i could participate
Waste...
GUGASTONIE!! My dream came true!!
What a waste
Guga's cameraman needs some appreciation
Htf did that happen??? My brain just stopped working 🤯🤯🤯 Please keep that combo up!!!
Ok this collaboration makes up for the one with those cringe frat boys who I believe were called team rar
This man legit controls the wagyu market, making all of those stakes made the price go up by 2 times probably 🤣
Matt is lucky to eat the best meat in the world, which he envies LOL
Collab with Joel Hensen
Whaaaaaaat. Stonie!
Watching this as a butcher is interesting, the way he cut the rib eyes that is . Love this guy pushing himself in uncomfortable situations. That's why he is successful.
Gotta love it when Youtubers Collab
Guga ur too good
Guga, did you use Fogo?👍
im sorry thats just a waste of wagu lol
YOOO GUGA WAS FLYING IN THAT FIRST DRIVING CLIP🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Horrible waste :(
PLAYA' , Thats Hella Cool Man 😁🤙
i first watched matts video, and now i am watching this.. This is A5 production quality.. great vid. like this comment to make guga invite me for some Wagyu
I am most concerned about why anyone has a mask on
Man, it hurts seing all that A5 wagyu being inhaled and accompanied by water straight in the stomach... Seriously? :-)
that was so WRONG!
When not broke
Guga, when you break another world Record... better just feed the Crowd!
This is a collab
One thing that you might not notice is that it's much harder to cut the wagyu out in the open, away from the freezer, because wagyu fat starts to melt at room temperature, so huge props to guga for being able to remain steady and composed during that record
sup guga
This is a bro vid, and that is not a complement. Sorry, Guga, I know we are all bored and restless, but this is not fun, entertaining, or educational.
Guga surrounded by all the flames makes him look like the final Villain from an Anime 😂
Epic collab, I watched both your channels!
When you will release your own MERCHANDISE
Holy Moly 🙀
why? whats the point?
Last time I was this early Angel was not dry aged yet
This video feels like a serious documentary
This is America summed up 😂
Fire👏
i like the car saab 900
Dry age the Guinness world book of records!!!
This is taking STEAK VIDEOS to the MOON 🚀🚀🚀 What's next BRO !?!?
This video, fire content after the last special
Yooo this is a crazy collab lol
Heretical waste of good meat, potential and actual
Guga and Matt Stonie together in one video? This is gonna be awesome!
watching all of this great meat being eaten like this just annoys me for some reason
Ohhhhh is that unckle roger
Most of us came from Matt Stonie about the collaboration.
i remember watching matt stonies videos
Sausage
Its a damn waste. You make great steaks and then a lizard person just downs them on a timer without even enjoying the food.
Finally, we have a collab between my favorite YouTube food cooker, and my favorite YouTube food eater
The intro 🔥🔥
hi
Finally a worthy opponent to watch and eat to this video.
Been waiting for this colab for YEARS
Am I the only one who thinks Guga lost a lot of weight?
video quality is great man 👌👌👌
Great job👻😎
GUGA THIS WAS AWESOME
Guga making collabs of the century
Well that’s something that you don’t see everyday
Guga blessing us with the insane montages
Two of my faves together…sweet and savory!!
Embarrassment of Riches.  What a f’ing waste.  Shame.
Here from matt gonna sub (yes.)
Damn, this hurt my soul to watch lol
Collab with Strictly Dumpling in the future pls! :)
guga..this was epic
This is a wonderful collab :)
I've been a three-year paid member on the other channel and a fan from the very start.  This is the first time I've ever given a video a thumbs down.  there has been some wasted meat on this channel in the past, but that was always in the pursuit of knowledge.  like the one-month brisket.  This was just a complete waste.  I felt sick watching it.  I know this is a business and your new marketing company is behind a lot of this.  But it's just not what this channel was built on.
Lowkey looks and sounds like the professor
Guga looks like version of Matt in which he actually gained weight after eating all that much
Nice collaboration  Greetings from Germany to everyone stay healthy and fit for gugafoods🔥👍
and finally my dream come true.. Two of my fav youtubers 😘😘😘  Collabe of the century
im sorry but this video was horrible. hella people that would die to try wagyu once in their life...and THIS is what people with wagyu do with it?
my boi matt stonie
Why the upload now? I was just done eating... Now im starving again
Price of dalstrong knives are gonna go up lol
Ironic that Matt is the one trying to set the eating record when Guga looks like he could eat Matt.
WOWOW
A challenge from me is how about smoke it first and then dry age it how about that?
Isn't he going to get mad diarrhea?
Try waygu milk
angel prob got a heartattack from watching all this wagyu disappear
It feels like the Gladiator in the Arena against 7 enemys 💪💪
Damn, you’re just making steaks in bulk now. Respect.
WOW I never knew how much I wanted this collab until it happened!
The best collab ever. Loved it❤
just watched the video on Matt's channel now I am here to support you
try pineapple tenderizing on wagyu and cooking rice in beef tallow
Now we go to the collab of post10 and Drain Addict to unclog Matt Stonie's toilet drain.
It's illegal to see wagyu with burnt crust But damn it looks more delicious tbh😨
Epic collab
guga i challenge you make lemang!
Who's here after watching matt stonies video
Guga's literally just going for the achievements at this point haha  Love it!
Incredible collab didnt see this one coming!
Just came from stonies video!
THE COLLAB WE DIDNT KNOW WE NEEDED!
Good content guga
The slow mo shots with Guga surrounded by the flaming pits looked so epic 🤩
Thumbnail was ☄️
I clicked the like button right after seeing the thumbnail. Amazing absolutely beautiful.
LESGO MY 2 FAVOURITE EAT YOUTUBERS COLLAB
This collab is lit fam!!!
Guga’s feeling like: my precious meat is getting slaughtered
Guga: "Wagyu is not something you eat everyday"  Also Guga: *uploads Wagyu world records, 15000$ Wagyu cooking video and a Wagyu filet mignon in the span of 3 weeks*
YASSSSSSSA
Damn Guga has lost a bunch of weight! Looking good man!
5:01 "absolutely" LMAOOOOOO
It looked like water was falling out of Matts hands while he ate
lets goooo
Total waste of food! Absolutely disrespectful to the meat producer, the cows who died for the food and everyone who would love to ENJOY this beef!
You didn't want ANGEL doing that challenge? coulda eat so much wagyu
The best collaboration ever
This collab is a W
THE COLLABS ARE CRAZY
