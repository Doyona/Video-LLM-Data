she is gorgeous and sweet
she has the most amazingly beautiful eyes
She has the teevairas
They are into scientology.
She's an actor.
Shut up Meg!
I like how she tries not to waste food. She didn't grow up with a lot of money.
Welcome to Holly weird she is so high she can barely hold her eyes open they're so dark and glassy if she drove a car she get a DUI no telling how much she drinks not to count the drugs she does on a daily basis way to go you're an excellent role model for children
I've seen Silk oatmilk creamer, the oatmeal cookie flavor at the store I work at. It looks really delicious. I've always wanted to try it lol
She's the reason why I got Poppy cuz I never heard of it until I was just for you and now I'm addicted even though it's expensive
She doesn't have a second for lunch. I hate when people say this. Shut up. There is yogurt anything bia come on. She's trying to come across as not a diva. Not working honey....
Coffee makes cigarettes amazing ❤
She's so real lmao
I like how she describes her day compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's weird eating😊
😂❤ cool!
Boring and also lies. She never cooks.
The most humble Hollywood person.. I like her
BORING
She seems so normal and down to earth, so rare in her profession and obvious beauty
She seems super authentic something that is super hard to find in Hollywood.
I've been to sonny's once it was bomb
9:34 ice cream & McDonald’s soft srrve
I got it. Goin opposite. Little sample enough  Don't waste resources. Breath stops for 1k trillion yrs
Basically she doesn't cook. She likes order or let her mom cook.😊
Everyone is praising her for not wasting food, but how about she teaches her kids to finish what they ask for?  I’m not talking about forcing them to clean their plates full of food we dish out to them them (like our parents did), just maybe teach THEM not to waste food, and portion control at the same time.
She has a very down to earth normal kinda vibe. Then it struck me shes a good actor. Celebrity IMPOSTER!!!!!! I kid. Shes awesome. More people like her in the world will make the world a more wholesome place.
I always had must goes on Friday night. Everything I made all week must go!
Thrifty’s rocky road fresh from the drug store ice cream parlor is the best!
Lovely woman. Not sure she needed to bring russia in conversation knowing that Ukraine is going through hell
Love that your real my daughter loves ice-cream as well !!!!🧡
Now fled the country because Ashton is apart of the P-diddy scam.
I like her!
Ok I like her but just say PEE. Tinkle is super annoying. I said what I said.
I'm sorry what is this accent/voice she's doing?
Who knew that Mila and I eat our avocados exactly the same. Simple and perfect.
no ukranian left in her…so sad
I like her
Definitely frothing!  I make my our bread Easy once to get into it..simple/ Good coffee: peerless/ hawaain..pressed:) yum Avocados.  My Aged Avocado tree  Produces lots/ lots throughout the year. Thanks for sharing! I grew up in a big family, have nine children  4 brothers 4 sisters   Give me some potatoes, rice, oatmeal flour, I can make everything throw in a few eggs or flaxseed, some veggies, etc. i can create whatever
My favourite Ukrainian 😂 😊😊😊😊😊
I can’t get Meg Griffin outta my head, like at all
I have planet oat creamer -vanilla and I love it! Also, it takes me an hour or two to eat.
Shut up Meg.
OK this was boring
Shes so sexy 😍
In my 70 years on this planet, I have never seen a more beautiful woman than Mila Kunis. And she is a sweetie too.
Oh mo “shut up, Jackie!”
Thanks Mila knowing ur kid is a pescatarian makes me wanna try my best to be one! 😊
I just love her!!!
😂😂😂 I’m right with you on the creamer it’s the only one I like. Too funny, but hey we are the smart ones right?
marxist nova
theres a chair cp24
how was the 12 stories lol
WHAT HAPPENED TO TIFF
Everything has dill ❤
Russians or Ukrainians? Mila, what are you talking about? Ukrainians is not  russians.
Borsch is a Ukrainian dish, not russian.
Russian food??? Mila is ukrainian, isn't she? Again - russian borsh??? Really?🤨
I love dill-укроп. My husband asked to not put dill at least in a cake 😅.  I guess it is our culture to add dill in almost  everything. ❤
I’m indian but i basically grew up in the states and i asked my mom for indian food recipes and she did the same thing! “a little bit of this and a bit of that” 😅😅😅
She’s sooo relatable
she is amazing
Mila, you’re not russian, you’re Ukrainian. And those dishes are Ukrainian dishes
This was so 9:14 chaotic, but that’s what makes it real. Most of the other celebrities’ “What I eat in a day” are so incredibly planned and unrealistic that it’s obviously not true.
Was this before or after she defended Danny Masterson?
I LOVE!!!
Very cool. Can't believe I never seen this before. ❤❤
Shut up Meg !
Coffee made with Silk oat milk creamer sounds delicious! Now I want to try it! 😋
Pescatarians do eat meat. Cold blooded meat.
"I don't even know what to call myself, Russian or Ukrainian" , no self-respecting Russian, Ukrainian, German, French, Georgian or anyone would say that. Imagine Irish person saying: "I don't know whether I should call myself Irish or English", or German person saying: "I don't know whether I am French or German".  I can imagine that someone from occupied North Caucasus region, such as Dagestani would say that they are Russian and it's sad, what's wrong with her 🤦If she doesn't identify herself as an Ukrainian, why can't she stop talking about her origin...
Seriously y we interested in what people eat 🙄
Why isn't her husband cooking? Embarrasing how the "family head" does nothing. Only thing men can is cheating
Where does she get them eyes from?! I was trying to look at her mom or dad and I couldn’t see it though they are both adorable
Mila must go to Saffron and Rose on Westwood Blvd in LA...my favorite place every time I visit UCLA. I always go to Naab for a Salmon Kabob and Saffron and Rose for Persian ice cream mmmm!
Mila and Ashton still together...wow...🥰🙏
she is giving me off vibes. sorry.
😬😬😬
she is Made it up she a Real Lier how she eats just like me She Copying me like From Breakfast and Dinner in everyday she made it up and  Copying me she is a real Lier she is a Boyfriend Stealer
Mila ❤❤❤ much love and thanks for sharing
Who cares what she eats ??? 🤢
She's full of Bologna except I totally agree with her about McDonald's
She is freaking real. She just doesn’t care about the haters!
In a bit a trouble now.
My grandma is czech. Slot of it is stuff like she made
Big fan of Mila and her work!! Love this video, and hearing a little more about her and her life
She makes it sound like she has a 9 to 5 remote
Omg my dad did that every Friday after work I love ice cream every flavor except black sesame but chocolate,butter pecan, coffee, chunky monkey strawberry but on a diet just the one tiny trader Joe chocolate on a tiny cone with a banana, I’m a mushroom olive pizza .. I love fish broiled platter… I hate breakfast lol I eat avocado toast but twice toasted with drizzle honey hot pepper chile flakes and an egg on top poached or over easy in olive oil. Sushi the fish on my sushi has to be cooked . I love smoothies never have time to make but when I was a kid skim milk banana n cinnamon was my smoothie… I have to start green juice. I do t like meat often but a good steak yay!! I want to try borscht because I love beets! I love pickles … poppi is great n kevita
So down to earth and real ❤
The most insipid couple on earth☹️
Those eyes...........madness❤❤
I am using this video for my English lesson now to teach my students morning routine vocabulary. Honestly, it looks as though the video was created for English lessons, with all the accompanying photos and images. And the way Mila speaks so clearly makes it a very valuable source for English language learners! Can anyone explain about the word “tinkle”? How common is it in English. Is it used more with kids?
Why don't they still make these?
Hey lovely beautiful  Mila kunis😮 thanks alot,for these Video sharing to us
Love that feeling! Mila Kunis my all time fave! ❤❤❤
Thrifty 😂😂😂 Core memory. I LOVE mint chip.
Shut up meg
She’ll always be my favorite
Sad that she names all these russian meals implying that she is russian...she was born in Chernivtsi which is a Ukrainian city…It took russia to attack Ukraine, kill thousands of Ukrainian people for everyone to understand that Ukraine is a separate, independent country! ... and Borshch is a Ukrainian soup!!! Hope she does not want to be associated with russia anymore!
All I hear is meg
The kar jenners should watch this Mila and Ashton are famous actors and they dont need a chef to slice a cucumber!
Wait I die that she does non dairy milk but loves ice cream lol
TF about she doesn't know what to call herself in "this time". I can help? whether she is dump AF or I don't know how the person who knows about ongoing w@r in Ukraine, yes Mila the w@r is still here and no, we are still Ukrainians here. And we always will be. I can present her a history book or at least send a link to news in Ukraine.
Eastern European, Russian, whatever…their chicken broth is like spring water when their done.  So pure and fine…and tasty!!! How to Eastern European craft service partner who insisted on going out to get a whole chicken one night for soup lol. Was the bomb!. So good.
I LOVE everything about this video ❤
Not a good person?
I have watched this video so many times since it came out. I love it haha
💞🫂
she fits her role in bad moms perfectly 🤣🤣 she's so humble and genuinely unintentionally relatable, love that about her ❤
Yes, I’m Russian in US  and dill goes with everything.    My kids used to say” ma, just a reminder, dill is a garnish not a side dish” 😂
Who cares
Dude at Sonny's just became a bit more profitable haha!
"My kid is a pescatarian.!"Not an astronaut?
Uuumm...like UM wo cares.  God lord, all that money and you can't be bothered to learn how to speak concisely in interviews?????????????
Mila kunis is one of the fallen angels/ demons that got kick out from heaven for their rebellion. A lot of them are in this generation ( celebrities, politicians, scientists) Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon🙏🏼❤️🕊Repent , believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again
Lol she is adorable. 😂
‘I’m not a restaurant’ 😂😂😂
Mila, you don’t know what to call yourself?!! rus?! Borsch for your information is a Ukrainian dish!!!! Shame on you Mila so disappointed;(((
She’s a human ❤
Kunis is so cool and relatable ❤. Probably one of the most down to earth celebrities today .
Mila is still Gorgeous, wow ! Thrifty ICECREAM oh he'll yeah   Thrifty's black cherry and Pecan Praline 😋 Damn so Good. Love u Mila 😂
1000% they have a personal chef. She hasn’t cooked a day in her life, and she is right
Thrifty Brand Ice Cream is AMAZING
Omggg LOL...acting like she's so "BUSY".  Like seriously, wtf could you possibly be busy doing?!
This is Ukrainian food, not russians!!!
Asschin ketcher even hates ice cream
I 100% related to the ice cream thing. Its bloody delicious
"I'm not a restaurant" is something my mom has reminded us multiple time throughout our lives
Shut up meg
She’s beautiful and funny!
I eat exactly the same as mila 🇨🇦
What kind of an actor works from home?
Mila, are you kidding me? You were born in Ukraine, and now you say you don’t know how to call yourself??? And did you call Borcht russian soupy thing? Damn, girl, shame on you….
she made this all up to be relatable.
Borsch is ukranian dish
Love how real she is haha
Who wants to see Mama Kunis making her chicken soup?  C'mon Mila, make it happen!
Girl doesn’t know she’s in fact Ukrainian. Sad.
Basic non exciting
fish is meat
Literally how I make my avocado toast.
wow dude, your husband cheated on his wife w/o a condom & pretends he doesn't see that his date has been murdered when he goes to pick her up. sorry for the association, but stay away - please
Had no clue she was Russian tell me an adorable woman still all I see is rich people live finely then others
why does she say Russian, Ukrainian. mehh its kinda weird.  This is not an old Video.  Context is everything.
As a mother this was the most relatable one of these I’ve seen. She even used the same brands that we do. Love it!
Damn she is not only pretty but also such a fun person i love her
She creeps me out
Alpukat dan protein dan vitamin adalah kunci
We don't really care
When she said "we work from home", I didn't know she has other jobs than acting haha
I knew avocado toast, "bowls", quiona and protein smoothies would be mentioned in here.
Who cares?
borshch is a Ukrainian dish and not Russian as she said, but if Mila thinks of herself as Russian than for them everything is just russian
Brushes teeth. Skips shower 🧼 🚿
she eats at 9:30 cause theres no time for us to eat when we are getting kiddos ready
Gotta love her <3
Mila is just so cool, funny & authentic, I would love to be friends with her, she seems like she would be so much fun! I think she’s secretly thinking, what I eat in a day videos are just so lame! 😂 Ice cream is my favourite food group too and my husbands 😜
I heard she LOVES pizza 😂
Her describing the russian cooking, especially the chicken soup and the dill, I get it. I never figured out how my grandma is doing the magic chicken broth. I did it once with her and she just put something together
Love her so much! She's authentic ❤
6:00 I tried russian pickled 🍉 it wasn't delish 😅
Does she seem weirdly more russian in the interview??
Her diet: “we try.” 😂
she is absolutely perfect. all women should have to look exactly like her.
She's similar with Vanessa
GET TO THE FOOD PART
I bet a lot of vodka and borsjt?
As they would say in england  may I go my  love mila  why should u know my game ❤❤😂😂
Shut up Meg
I can see her sneaking off after she drops her kids to school and getting a Popeyes chicken sandwich
Mila, you are amazing!
I always loved her eyes
She eats sausage all day and that’s all folks
But WHAT does she use on her hair? It’s amazing
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ashton is one lucky guy
I just hear meg griffin. Cant help it.
I love you on this episode, OMGosh! You are so relatable to a lot but me personally. Your demeanor is so inviting and nonchalant. Honest! Real! Almost like you’re not rich and been famous for so long. Mom’s are so awesome! Congrats!
She is like a beautifull human owl..
‘Everything but the kitchen sink meal’ honestly my dad gets everything the rest of us can’t finish. Men have black holes for stomachs! But my parents also hate wasting food. If it can be frozen or refrigerated, it will be. Anything else is sent to the compost
Absolutely no one cares.
evil woman
hahah my mom is master pickler as well😀
I have Misfits too, Mila!!!  She's just as cute as a button!!!
PUT "DAVES KILLER BREAD'" IN YOUR CUPBOARD FOR 3 MONTHS.  WHEN YOU CHECK BACK IN WITH IT, YOU'LL SEE IT LOOKS LIKE NEW.  THAT'S THE PRESERVITIVES in it.
We don't care!  Dont ya just loathe people that protect evil because the evil wasn't inflicted on them?  There are 2 women who were raped by your buddy you evil person. You guys shot yourself in the feet.  Glad you drink coffee because it destroys the adrenils.
WHO Cares 🙄🥱
These days she’s eating her own foot.
Anyone who doesn’t know what “everything but the bagel” seasoning is sucks at life 😂
Anyone here after the letters?
Always felt she is two faced or just stupid.  Once she was pretending to be supporting Ukraine, crying from happiness when her child said she was Ukrainian…or my god ..how touching. And here we go , here she she lives at a time when she doesn’t know how to call herself anymore. Russian cuisine Borsch? Er? What? Vereniki also Russian ? Really ? Can anyone find her a teacher to explain things finally
We eat so similarly it’s eery. Even more eery because she’s been my doppelgänger my entire life 😆
Will you & Ashton visit Danny Masterson in prison?
I am a drip coffee girlie myself. Went to target and found the creamer she mentioned and I am in love! Shout out to Mila ❤😂
Good diet, Meg. 👍🏼
Who cares???????
I really don't understand the 'we're living in times when I don't know what to call myself anymore' part. Like, really? Russians invaded your country girl! You should stand by Ukrainians!
Wow, Mila is so "authentic". Saying "oh, I finally discovered that I'm Ukrainian" wheb the war in Ukraine started and being russian wasn't cool anymore. Now, when the war in Ukraine is a bit off the headlines, she can say "russian/Ukrainian or whatever I am, I don't see the diffrence". Hypocrite 🤮
One of the most down to earth actresses.  Im Ukrainian too.
Such a down to earth interview.  And by the way, I did watch you in THE LUCKIEST GIRL ALIVE.  YOU WERE AMAZING!
So ug. )LY)
Mila is so down to earth ❤love that she doesn’t pretend about anything and they eat leftovers  and we do the same Friday dinner is all the leftovers from the week (buffet dinner lol )🙌🏼We love ice cream we always have like 5 different flavors 😊
Dill- the king of herbs in Eastern Europe.
Thanks for talking about real food.
Omg we live the same life except she’s a lot skinnier
I love her.
No one cares
we need your  mom's cookbook!!
Leftovers 😅😂😂
So good to see someone down to earth giving normal answers to these questions. She doesn’t drink seaweed juice and hasn’t used the word cleanse even once. That’s Mila kunis, so greatttttt!!!!!
this is so real i love her omg
Making mistakes about countries… it’s a shame in this situation
You know how you can just tell someone is a good person? I get that feeling from Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher both every time I watch one of their interviews.
She's just a typical mum like the rest of us. She's so real and down to earth. ❤
Love to listen to this woman. She makes me smile.
See horses
Dear @Mila Kunis,  The dishes you mentioned belong to Ukrainian cuisine, not Russian. Our distinct cultures set us apart as separate nations. It's time to clarify your stance and identity.
It is so unexpected that Mila calls herself Russian. C'mon. She is from Chernivtsi. And varenyky and borsch is Ukrainian food.
My mom also still cooks for 6 and she's only with my dad 😂
Some of the so called famous and rich people forget fast where they came from and always talk about fancy things but Mila is relatable very consious about not wasting food and buying good organic but imperfect veggies. Very down to earth person.
She is the complete opposite of Gwenyth Paltrow, so relatable and based, unlike Paltrow who is bizarre and unrelatable.
Ok but that chocolate malted crunch from thrifty’s is my all time favorite ice cream 😭😮‍💨
I love how she weights 90 pounds and thinks ice cream is a food group.
She seems authentic. It is very relatable ❤
She publicly supports Ukraine after full-scale war starts and then she says she doesn’t know how to call her anymore. With all due respect dear Mila you describe Ukrainian cuisine cause your parents are from Ukraine and only in here people cook something named borsch
This is 1 of the best I've seen. Kudos to Mila 👍
Thriftys Chocolate Malted Crunch is my favorite too!!
Mila ❤
Dont forget Ashton is a billionaire and Mila is an A list actress. The income they bring in can live like a king! Suprisingly they do everything for themselves and eat like normal people! 😂😂
She is such a good storyteller. I literally click on her clips because she just puts so much personality into videos
She can just tell the truth and say that she has someone cooking for her. There is no way she does not have a chef/cook with all the money that she has.
She. Sounds and looks different
Your mum sounds like my punjabi mother can cook everything and anything.
I just love her. She is SO real and down to earth. What a gem!
She is at the peak of her beauty. Just stunning.
Shut Up Megg
Love Mila ❤
If you date a Russian woman, high chance you are going to love chicken soup. I am married to an Italian guy and they don't really eat soups in general but he is obsessed with chicken soup, especially when he is sick. And borsch, of course :)
I am wondering where her necklace is from its so beautiful
The most realistic food diary so far 🫨
Meg?
Love Mila. She's someone I would love to have a conversation with.
Mila!!! I love love love this interview! So honest and mommy😄I can relate and appreciate all of it! Also chocolate malted crunch is my favorite ice cream as well🙃you're the best!
Chocolate malted crunch ice cream is very good!
I wish I could eat pizza and ice cream, and stay thin like Mila.
That's not a good choice mita
anyone know a dupe of the smoothies shes talking ab?
Another interesting fact.. everyone going on how great she is cause of these awful food choices, her and her husband support their friend Danny Masterson who’s on trial for many r*pe crimes against innocent women he took advantage of. They were literally just seen not too long ago hanging out with him. It’s truly disgusting what Danny did and they always supported him
I find it hilarious when people say they don’t eat meat and then they turn around and eat meat. Do they think that a fish is a vegetable? Or is it that there’s this strange belief that a fish is not an animal? I mean why eat fish if you’re not gonna eat meat there must be a reason why they’re not eating meat? I mean I don’t eat meat I don’t eat dairy because I don’t eat dead animals. I don’t either secretions and I don’t eat their unfertilized eggs, because the cruelty that goes on in the Animal industry and I mean I wasn’t always vegan so I understand why people eat these things but I mean if you’re not going to eat some thing because you’re a vegan because you don’t want to contribute to Animal cruelty then why eat the fish?
I just hear Meg griffin lol
That is the most realistic thing that I saw like ever 😂😂😂
Beautiful mila
My son would like me to write that he wants your mom's pickles. He loves pickled foods. 🥒🥒
I just love her
Pretty sure she eats verrry little each day.
My favorite interview of this series so far. Her diet is related and she’s down to earth. Also Dave’s killer bread is SO good with avocado, egg, and black pepper. I could eat it every day.
Yummy! Great coffee idea! 🤩
Would like to mention, that borsch is for sure Ukrainian dish) please do not say it as it is the same… it like to say that tacos are American food.
1111111111111111111111111
Mila is so normal
I really like how she says "my husband" instead of his name and assuming that everybody know who he is. They both seem very humble with who they are and what the have acconplished in their carreers. 😊
Doll to Russians is like cilantro to us Mexicans I see 😅
She eats her avocado toast like me!
OOOhhh, lots of her food is how I eat, but I do need to eat more pickled things. I've had some over the years but just need to eat more. I heard it's great for the digestive system.
Very interesting.
Everyone is obsessed with , relatability, noted!
No more guys in hollywood
So since hollywood thinks im gone there getting a little carried away be carfull
When you where a kid you wanted to be a boy so bad you would run from yourself for having cooteys
what a cool person....I like her.
👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
Pickled peaches, sounds weird but it's so good!  Mila is such a genuine person.
Angelina Jolie is waiting for you
It’s crazy because no matter how beautiful this woman is…. All I hear is Meg griffin
shut up meg
What is tinkle?
Listen get out doesn't mean go to a different house of mine if u need a box I can help
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I really like it, like her ❤
Very interesting, especially the parts about authentic Russian/Ukrainian food and going around to all the ice cream places.  The one thing that all the celebrities in this video has in common that I have watched is that they all really like ice cream. My favorite ice cream is mint chocolate chip.
I am here❤
I love that she clean the fridge and don't waste food. I love that she wants leftovers, like all of us. They stayed down to earth. I come from her neighboring culture and we also don't waste food and share her cultural tradițions. This is by far the most relateble food diary
I am easter european, we also eat bros and pickels watermelon all the time!
So the life hack is to live close to mom and have food delivery.
Mila, te amooo!
I love Mila and her work. She is amazing down to earth person and her support for Ukraine was tremendous and me as Ukrainian appreciate it a lot but please don’t mix russia and Ukraine, it’s more than just food and traditions. It’s easy to know what to call yourself if you know what you stand for❤
I use to be so obsessed with this videos and then I realized that was because I had a lot of eating desorders jaja everything is alright now tho. And now I just enjoy when they talk about their life
Shut up Meg.
She's amazing! She didn't try to do too much or make it look like she has it all together.... in the normal chaos we call life, I think this was perfect. Very relatable, and honestly, it sounds like a very fulfilling life ❤
Isn’t it strange that she called borscht Russian? It’s a Ukrainian soup, and Mila is Ukrainian as well…..
It’s so sad u can hear how woke stuff affect her
This seemed kinda fake where she doesn’t even eat anything haha
So u brush ur teeth and wash it down with coffee that wud ruin my mouth haha
Shout out to Mila Kunis for having the most relatable diet ever
I honestly hope Ashton and Mila have a life long amazing happy marriage. You can just see how much they love each other and their children when they speak of each other or look at each other.
wow great job meg
she is so cute and i now can hear her accent in this. she covers it well for her roles...
Best eat in a day ever Mila First time I've heard of the expression tinkle 😀
Jackie is so bubbly :) Shes great !
I just want to taste her mom's broth and stroganoff...
Misfits? I have used them for years! Am I a movie star now? Haha  what a doll!
Refreshingly real. What a balanced and confident human being 🙂
A person that consider ice cream as a food group and says that's her favorite food group, that my type of person.
I love this beautiful gal
“When I first wake up in the morning…” Me: “Shut up, Meg”
Mila would go crazy here in Argentina, the ice cream is heavenly
We love a frugal queen!
Isn’t she the one who wouldn’t even taste an Oreo on “The Real”?
I always watch this like legit everyday and I don’t know why😅
Ice cream = best food group
She’s fabulous - Cut the terrible b-roll and either get her real footage or just show her
HollyWierd
8:01 Everything was fine and beautiful until this moment 😂 Still love Mila and her family though ❤
See she’s just like us guys I like regular pot coffee to lol
This is by far the most authentic and/or real Everything I Eat in a Day Video. I loved it! 💕
Borsch is Ukrainian dish, not russian. Borsch soup in Ukraine added to Unesco endangered heritage list.
Bless her
To marry someone with that personality and that good looking most be like winning the lottery and I don't even believe marriage is a thing.
I love the fact that Mila says you’ll never get e measurement from her moms…..I could totally relate….my mom is the same…you ask for measurements and portions and she says “a lil bit of this…a lil bit of that”
Love her and love Ashton. One of my fav celeb couples
Nothing inspiring
McDonald’s does have damn good soft serve 😂
😁😂 молодца, верим 😁 and in reality count every calorie and no sugar, no gluten 😁
borscht 😋
Good video!!
Such a gorgeous soul 😊
Love her ❤
Silk Oat Creamer is the bomb! I like their soy creamer as well. Very creamy. They understood the assignment.
I just love her
GHARR SE GHICH LUNGAA KOI KU6 NAHII BOL PAAYEGAA..🥳🥳🥳
9:24 "it's my favorite food... group" 😆🙈👏
To suggest that there is no difference between Russian and Ukrainian culture and food, particularly in the context of the Russian war in Ukraine, is dismissive of the cultural identity and sovereignty of the Ukrainian people. It's important to recognize and respect the unique cultural heritage of every nation. Mila should know geography and her own roots better.  Furthermore, as a public figure with a significant following, Mila Kunis has a responsibility to be mindful of the impact of her words and actions on her fans and the broader community. During war, where tensions are high and emotions are raw because of thousands Ukrainians, who now are dying because of Russia,  it's important to be sensitive and thoughtful about what we you and do.
Seriously McDonald’s soft serve.. try Häagen Dazs vanilla that is bomb!
That smoothie delivery sounds like a scam, how easy is it to make your own smoothie!
California eating is sooooo different than eating in the south 😂😂😂😂
Shuddup Meg
Fun insight into her life and dietary habits.  Dill is a huge staple in my Mediterranean family as well.  Adds so much to a meal.
When did she go full Hollywood? She used to be cool and now she sounds like a typical vacuous California girl
Was happy until... "Russian, Ukrainian, we are living in a time when I do not know how to call myself anymore." Growing up in CHERNIVTSY, this woman does not know that she was actually VERY Ukrainian... Meh, sad.
Borsch is originally Ukrainian traditional soup. Just as Ukrainians and russians are completely different nations.
Can I live with them?
Everything in this daily eating plan sounds completely reasonable and delicious! A very respectable diet.
So she has dairy free throughout the day then Dairy Ice cream at night, how does that make logical sense?
Why Russian food - she’s Ukrainian
Mila (Ashton), one of the best ice creams, is a Texas legend Blue Bell. You need to see if you can find it in CA... or wherever you live. It's brand logo has a farmer walking a cow.   All Blue Bell flavors are incredibly Delicious and savory. My all-time favorite is the Strawberry & Homemade Vanilla. You'll find GIGANTIC pieces of strawberry in the ice cream.  The Rocky Road will make you feel HEAVENLY.  Blue Bell isn't necessarily sold in every state.   If you can't find any near you - give me a shout, and I'll send you a couple of half gallons! I am being serious... No I'm not affiliated with the Blue Bell company.
Hello from Ukraine 🇺🇦, Mila ❤️
All I hear is Meg from Family Guy.
I will always remember her from the movie The Black Swan :)
I remember seeing her and Ashton grocery shopping with their kids when I lived in LA. Ashton is taller than I thought and both are gorgeous in person!
So pretty much she does nothing.  She gets food delivery and her mom drops off food 🤷🏻‍♀️
I love Mila and honestly think she’d be such a fun friend. Lol eating kids leftovers and eating dessert after they’re in bed😂 love her she’s so real.
Мила - прекрасна ☺️👍
❤Mila! I love your down to earth attitude ☕️
She is so awesome
"They sent me like ice cream of the month club" WHOS THEY 💀
"i also have a mom that lives   15 min away" as opposed to " My mom lives 15 min away" see the difference it is a bit strange.
so relatable, so REAL and so precise hahaha. i often skip breakfast(not intentionally), sometimes im anxious , getting indecisive of what to eat.....
What does tinkle mean? I couldn't find the meaning. Thanks!
Silk Oatmeal Cookie is my favorite creamer ever 🤤
She is living my life. Stars are just like us 😂
What a gem
Ukrainian is what you are called  when you were  born in Chetnivtsi
It's great you talk of your cultural food. It's more authentic and very healthy, like pickles, borch 🤩
My family would spend hours on a Saturday making pelmeni. If by rare chance we had leftovers, my grandma pan fried it. Goodness
She manages her money well :) She’s wonderful❤
O
What has happened in the world that the most important thing to talk about is what someone else eats in a day.REALLY REALLY
Borsch is Ukrainian national dish not russian. Mila you should know the difference between the two. You call yourself Ukrainian, shame on you   Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
The moment she said Thrifty’s chocolate malted crunch, she won me over.
She's a Russian Jew, although she comes from USSR - Ukrain which was part of Russia for centuries.  Russians in general not very picky people, very down to Earth and simplistic...
she’s cool
Why do I so badly want to see this acted out while mila narrates? Lol
Now i just need to have 3 abortions to be as slim as her
did u pickle the smoked herring im confused thanks, love the vid
I’m fanstruck: I from now on worship Mila and her Mom. DILL is my favorite herb.
I LOVE MILA SHES DOWN TO EARTH SHES GREAT ON THAT 70s SHOW ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF ALL TIME SHES BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT GOD BLESS HER ❤️✌️
She’s such a mood
Awesome!!! 😀 ❤
I could watch her talk all day. So genuine and confident
Love this ❤
I relate so much to her love for Ice Cream and I love the nighttime tradition of her and Ashton going into there freezer and pulling out ice cream to enjoy after they have put there kids to bed. Ice cream of the month clubs that sounds like the perfect clubs to join.
Боже какая ужасная диета у  вас милая 🤦‍♀️😂
Good product of good parents, and her children will benefit from this. Love the normality within the showbiz. Respect for keeping it real.
I like creamers because it's easier on stomach
"I don't cook separate meals because I'm not a restaurant"  - Every mom ever
Coffee shouldn’t be sweet. It should be bitter to stimulate the liver. Americans and their ghastly coffee and ghastly creamers!!
So happy she did a shout out to Sonny’s Icecream! Amazing LA secret, small business, the best!
Borshch is not russian, it's Ukrainian dish.
Borsch - a very russian soup???!!!! And you tell it during the ongoing war in Ukraine???? The war that russia started? Guys, just for information, borsch - is a traditional UKRAINIAN meal! Please, remember and don’t do such a outrageous mistake!
She's so normal I have no other way of commenting. Not that she's dull I doubt that very much but NORMAL.  That's it!
Other than the ice cream, everything she mentioned sounds so healthy. Yumm! She is certainly something.
Does anyone know where she got her blazer? I need it!!!
Why am I not believing she actually eats ice cream? Loves it -- but can't name a type she likes. Makes total sense.
It is too offensive for Ukrainians to hear that our national dishes somebody called russian. That's not true. Borshch, varenyky and salted (pickled) watermelon are Ukrainian dishes. Poland has pyrogy. russia has shchi and kulebyaka. But the world don't like those russian dishes.  During more than 5 centuries Ukrainians fight for freedom. During more than 5 centuries russians try to destroy Ukrainian language, culture and Ukrainians. But we survive and we don't let russians to kill us or stole our culture. That's enough! Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
In other words…. Mila doesn’t cook 😂 Love her!❤
What a normal family
I have a theory that if your mother makes chicken soup or some sort of chicken soup, you will not be able to replicate the broth. 🤭
i would thinks such rich folks have their cook or someone wjo cooks and cleans for them!?!! i defo would have lol if i had that much money! what!? you earn that much and you dont even have proper lunch lol, no thanks
Shut up Meg 😂
how can she eat ice cream every night and be so thin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why I cant🥲
Omg that was my mom I would ask her how much I put of salt or seasoning and she would say just taste it, never had any recipes it was all in her head. I miss her.
Ice cream is my favorite food group too :)
My girl loves her pickles and I love her!!!!!
Mila, you were born in Ukrainian city Chernivtsi. This is not russia. This is Ukraine. And borscht is a Ukrainian national dish. And yes, it’s important.
Mila…….Check out “ice cream bar” in San Francisco….best ice cream I’ve ever had!
Borscht is a Ukrainian soup, and has always been. Mila should definitely learn some history, especially because she claims to be Ukrainian. Such a shame :(
Тот самый русский комментарий, который ты искал (а) =) Приятно было услышать про борщи и пельмени от Милы !
Always loved her!
OHHHH MEG!
Don’t drink coffee first thing ladies it runs your cortisol way up
Borsch is a traditional Ukrainian beet soup.
Love this. So relatable. I also love to order out or order off the menu a dish I can’t make. It’s my thing. If I can make it, I’ll make it at home. So love that!
So I am Russian (adopted) living in an Italian family - and the one MAJOR thing I found between finding my bio family in Russia and having friends in Slavic countries is that Russians/Ukrainians/ Slavs in general have an INCREDIBLE ability to do a hell of a lot with very little food. I eat just about the same amount - maybe without lunch - but that’s all my body really needs 🤷🏼‍♀️ my Slavic friends and family are the same way - Italian family? HELL NO. ALL THE FOOD ALL THE TIME
Lmfao when she shaded McDonalds, “Yes most of the time their machines are broken” lol it’s so true though.
This food diary is literally all of us. So freaking normal. Prep meals, leftover, takeaways. The best.
Чи бачив  Клопотенко це відео?
She doesn’t know whether to call herself Russian or Ukrainian?
Fish is meat. It’s animal flesh which is meat.
Love this. Same Ukranian/Russian American here so relate to this all! 😅💞💞💞
I got air sall cans and cigarette box 7-Eleven Pizza in p*** and maybe a couple of BB gun air cartridges hanging around.
So she almost doesnt eat and when she does is salad and fish 💀
Well, everything that her mom makes sounds very Slavic or, let’s say, post USSR. I’m Russian and that’s a big part of what we eat. It’s very accurate and you wouldn’t really know about it unless you’ve lived in a Slavic reality
*Can we just stop for a second to think how sweet it is that Ashton is a Pescatarian because his daughter decided to be one? I love the parental support. My parents would've smacked me for even thinking of doing something like that*
Why does she always say "russian food" when she always states that she is ukrainian? Borscht and Varenyky are ukrainian dishes
Isn't she Ukrainian? It's really sad and frankly annoying that everything she describes her mom making she calls Russian. I'm Ukrainian and we would consider these Ukrainian recipes... Besides that she seems very down to earth and sweet.
Yup...moms eat their kids leftovers....🫡
Borsch is UNESCO official national culture Ukrainian heritage!!!  Not Russian.🇺🇦🙏🏽
It’s not a russian dish!🤦🏻‍♀️ everything that she’s described is from Ukrainian cuisine.
There’s an oatmeal cookie creamer?! Time to book a shopping trip to the USA!
She's beautiful
shut up meg
This girl looooves her mum ❤
6:26 Oh my god that is super relatable, my mama never gives me the exact measurements she always says you just feel it 😂😂😂😂 The sad truth I have never felt it 🤓
I got i so n so Al No crew
Meg Griffin
Dill 😍😍😍
She is beyond adorable
I'm Ukrainian and I say the same about my mom's chicken broth. So much flavor!!
Mila seems like she'd be such a fun and chill person to hang out with.
It’s so weird hearing Megs voice
Oh my but the thing is, this is the reality of a busy home life! "I'm not a restaurant" is so on point. Leftovers here and there, missed lunches, homecooked food from other house. It's a miracle we all get by at the end of the day!
I really loved the tip to make the best use of your leftovers— make it a “leftovers” on Fridays.
yeeess, Eastern European foods are amazing, i am from Latvia and the foods she described made sense.  USSR time moms know how to make a good soup and a good broth from scratch
This woman is so annoying!
wondering why she does dairy free creamer and then loads of ice cream later lol
Not long time ago I came across the video on internet where this bad actress was telling a story how her daughter made her crying by asking her whether she had Ukrainian roots and that she identified herself as a Ukrainian… This miserable actress said in that video that she was so proud that she related to Ukrainian people and that she’d been always feeling as a Ukrainian and so on. And what I hear in this video??? That she doesn’t know who she is and how to call herself!!! It’s unbelievable what a cynical liar this cheap actress is! It’s disgusting! It means she doesn’t have any clear understanding of who she is and she has not any opinion and position or self-identity but pretending having it when it’s benefited in front of the camera. What a shame! And Borshch is authentic Ukrainian meal and has never been russian one. What a russian bch!
I love it! “I am not a restaurant!” AMEN!
You don’t know what to call your self  Really….  I thought you were born in Ukraine  Right now is the time to stand up for us.  The reason I clicked off the video.  Very disappointed
That was my fav childhood ice cream as  well 🙌🏻
Love Mila's energy and practicality. And Russian food cooked by mom? Nothing better. My family is from Latvia and Lithuania, I grew up eating many of the foods she mentioned. My husband (his family is from Macau, he's Russian, Chinese, and Portuguese) share many of the same food culture. His Pelmeni are WAY better than mine any day of the week.
Shes so simple and beautiful and very nice person ❤🙏🫶
A few days ago I found That 70's Show streaming on Peacock. Thank goodness because I'm not someone that gets into new shows. I have watched a handful of new stuff. Love "Wednesday." Emily in Paris is cool, very "Sex and the City" vibes. I'm just busy and don't have time to watch things I have to pay attention too.  I've listened/watched Friends, The Simpsons, and Will & Grace Soooooo many times. I love that I finally found That 70s Show streaming. 😄🙃💖
She is so private loved getting a glimpse into her life.
OMG so Russians eat the same like Polish, I thought barszcz was polish only ( beetroot soup)
Mila, Beautiful, Nice and Smart Woman!
Shut up meg
what a sad life, she has all this money, but she eats like she is lower class, leftovers, mon cooking for her, etc
I love Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher.
She is very simple and humble being. Very rare trait in celebrities
😂 “I’m not a restaurant “ I felt that.
not a fan of poppi, but i am obsessed with ollipop lately.
She talks super fast and it gives me life
She's such a sweetheart. So beautiful and funny, she's comfortable being herself, which is admirable. I could see us being best friends (not that any one else cares 😂) Watching more interviews of her recently. God bless you me Mila in Jesus's mighty name 🥰
“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Mathew 6:25
Megan griffin 😭😭😭😭
Coz Russian food is the best food. ukraine doesn’t exist, no such thing like ukraine cuisine. Remember it
I'm so grateful that Eastern Europeans have some representation through her. Love the Ukrainian food she mentioned, and more people need to give it a chance ! it's so delicious!!
Russians or Ukrainians???... Mila really? What a ignorant you are! Russians are Russians and Ukrainians are Ukrainians!
Yo pensaba k das era un charlatán por Travis cartwra
Bamos haser  los suit grocery yo la Cree para ti y para mi esa línea
She don’t ever cook .
She’s so lovable
Yikes! Verbose and vexing.
I feel sorry for little Tommy Who got scolded by his parents for watching family guy while watching this 🥺🥲
“If you don’t like beets.. don’t eat it 😏” lol she so cool 😎
Andrechrome!
Shutup meggg
Longest ive heard meg talk
Sounds great...
Mom of two here and yup, that's pretty much how I eat too lol
She is so down to earth and very relatable
If you lived in a Soviet union and you lost your identity and you don't know what to call yourself anymore so that is your issue but if you are a big media influencer and you do such mistakes it's crucial. People should understand the basics and have more information about the topic they want to speak , don't come up with a videos showing how incompetent they are .Ukrainian people fought for centuries for the independence and still fighting and don't want to call their food Russian! Lots of People who lived in Soviet Union still  there in their minds , they don't differentiate nationalities /food/cultural differences and it's very offensive. I personally can't stand people who don't understand and don't want to discover who they are, their identity , nationality , culture, history , food and do on
I don't know if Mila did it to bring attention to her and just for the views but it's VERY OFFENSIVE TO NAME DISHES RUSSIAN WHEN THEY ARE NOT !  ITS LIKE SAYING THAT PASTA IS NOT ITALIAN OR BAKLAVA IS GREEK WHEN ITS NOT
IT'S SO OFFENSIVE to hear that Mila doesn't understand that the dishes she mentioned are not Russian originally and that Russian people stealing for centuries Ukrainian food and culture and try to put as it's their food . Mostly people will say that they don't care . If you don't know the exact origin of a dish so just call it Slavic , at least it won't offend people who fought for centuries for their independence and trying to be  understood by people that RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN ARE NOT THE SAME AND NEVER WERE !!!
why has mila kunis such sharp features and her parents r so bland ?
girls don't pee they tinkle
Omg, really, borsch is a Russian food?? Since when? Mila is from Chernivtsi, Ukraine, she definitely ,as Ukrainian , knows , that is specifically Ukrainian dish, and this was recognized by UNESCO , btw. So it’s very convenient to be proud Ukrainian , while talking about your foundation , but in interviews like this to be diplomatically mercurial whether you more Russian or Ukrainian . We’re fighting on information fields , too, for world to know and recognize our big difference and identity from russians. That was very disappointing
My Polish mum also makes extraordinary broth and beetroot soup and pierogi ♡♡♡
She’s so authentic . I love her energy ❤
when the war started i saw her many times talking about Ukraine and her daughter being proud to have some heritage there and now she calls all mentioned meals "russian" when they're not. like im sorry?
She seems so relatable despite being an acclaimed film and TV star! Love her
Fire sign… feel like i’m listening to my self talk😂
That's probably why people love you Molina cuz you have a touch of Latina looks in you and people love you because of that even though you're Jewish but the reason people are drawn to you is because you have a touch of Puerto Rican or Latina looks in you
Molina I love you so much I'm Latino Dominican and you remind me of one of my cousins that's probably why I've become such a big fan of yours now I'm like a new fan of yours I've just been drawn in by you recently some years back but I love you so much
Борщ - це борщ!❤ Це не рашн суп!
She's like all of us, basically. I love that she doesn't waste food and she won't let her kids eat more dessert than dinner!
Years ago she said she is american and doesnt want to be associated with ukraine, when war started she suddenly realised she will teach her children that they are half ukrainian and proud of it and heritage etc, started raising money to help etc, now she says she doesnt know who she is anymore and like ukraine or russian doest matter. Get your story straight. And if she was such a proud ukrainian she would never say smth like this...so just stick to being russian, Mila🤢
All of those home made dishes aren't exclusive 'Russian'. Would have been more correct to say 'Eastern European food'.
Borscht is Ukrainian.
I meet few people who enjoy fish as much as I do. I love salmon and Chilean sea bass is absolutely fantastic. I also love Brussels sprouts, another that few people I know will touch. I do eat meat, but I try to stick to lean meats. Fruit is important, I enjoy smoothies with yogurt and fresh fruit.
Wow she’s so normal. We eat the same things 😅 now I’m a Mila Kunis fan.
Mila, check out Fosselmann's Ice Cream! It's in Alhambra
Borscht isn't a russian soup with beets ....      Mila Kunis: "You can be born in Ukraine, collect 30 million dollars of aid for Ukraine, but still not understand the difference between Russians and Ukrainians"; "Damn, it's so sad";       Borsch (beetroot soup) is not just a traditional Ukrainian daily meal, it’s a symbol of unity - the basis of the culinary tradition of Ukraine, which is stronger than any modern experiments and overseas borrowings.  Borsch is a dish with a national character. It is primarily associated with Ukraine. This “association” smells delicious and promises warmth, comfort, fullness, and, thus, a sense of peace. When Ukrainians choose to cook borsch as their everyday main dish - their express their patriotism and show their love for Ukraine.
5:34
Who cares 😁 (
She seems so lovely and down to earth 🥰
Did she just call borscht russian? does she call herself Ukrainian after that?
All I think is “shut up meg” lmao
Love how she so detailed. First I wake up and roll over 😍
It's a pity that, having Ukrainian roots, she still does not understand the context. And speaks to a large audience about the fact that she doesn't know what to call herself: russian or Ukrainian. As follows mixing two completely different nations, with two different cultures (if russian's culture can be called a culture) and traditions. To be honest, it is very noticeable that she is more in a russian context, and does not know Ukrainian one at all. It would be nice for her to change that. Then she wouldn't say such nonsense. By the way, varenyky and borsch are dishes of Ukrainian cuisine.
Воно так і не зрозуміло українка вона чи руска ? Тварюка. Борщ вже офіційно визнали нашим, а воно далі транслює лайно що ми однакові. Фу
I'm sorry, Mila, but borsch is not a russian soup. It's a UKRAINIAN national dish. As well as varenyky.
From morning coffee rituals to ice cream at night, I think Mila and I could be perfect roomies.  Healthy eating with balance for the entire family. Great interview!
she will always be one of my favorite celebrities. you can tell she’s authentic and not just putting on a mask for show. I would love to shake her hand and tell her how badass she is
У американцев есть айфон, у русских есть космическая ракета Союз, а у украинцев настолько ничего нет, что они пытаются доказать всем что борщ это их блюдо, и это якобы повод для гордости 🤣  А почему молчите о сале и горилке ? Правильно, потому что кроме вас эту ху_т никто не ест и не пьет.
I am Ukrainian American. Everything she described as her eating habits clicks. Even the dip sauce on a piece of bread 😅
Nobody says that borscht isn’t Ukrainian but Russian. All I’m saying that it’s both. The word itself is derived from the word borshevik (hogweed), also existing in both languages. Plus, Ukraine and Russia are very intertwined. Should I remind you that Ukraine is a former Russian province. Ironically, Zelensky welcomes European and American high-ranking officials in the Mariinsky Palace in Kiev which was constructed by command of the Russian Empress Elizaveta Petrovna in 1744 during the Russian Empire era.
Russian cuisine is so delicious. 🥰 BTW I enjoy rewatching videos of Mila speaking Russian, especially the one when she’s standing up for Justin Timberlake during a press-conference in Moscow. So hilarious.
This is a snippet from the UNESCO web-site. I highlighted the main parts in which UNESCO clarifies that borscht isn’t an exclusively Ukrainian dish.  *The preparation of borscht is also practiced in communities throughout the region,* and while the inclusion recognizes the social and cultural significance of the preparation of borscht among Ukrainians, the listing of an intangible cultural heritage element under the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage *does not imply exclusivity or ownership of the respective heritage.*
Borsch and vareniki are not russian food, it's Ukrainian traditional dishes! Why again that disinformation everywhere, even on popular channels were so many subscribers? Don't you try to check the info before posting it or saying it?
I love Russian borscht. 🇷🇺🪆
Russian cuisine consists of many soups like borscht, shchi, okroshka, rassolnik, svekolnik, solyanka, ukha and so on. But my favourite Russian dishes are kholodets/meat jelly and bliny with caviar.
Read what UNESCO says exactly in its statement. That it protects UKRAINIAN borscht (meaning Ukrainian variation of it) and it’s ridiculous in and of itself. But then it proceeds that there are other variations of this dish and borscht isn’t exclusively Ukrainian. Oopsie.
Borscht is both Russian and Ukrainian. 🇷🇺🪆🇷🇺🪆🇷🇺🪆
Red borscht with beats is traditional UKRAINIAN sup🇺🇦!!!! not russian. There are some variations of borscht  with no beats in it,  originated in other countries of Estern Europe. But don't mix Ukrainian and russian traditions. Details matter
sad to hear from the person that lived in Ukraine, supported in every way, does not know about Ukrainian dishes, and nationality, so Russia oppresses our history. It seems that this person did not fully understand the problem of war and Russian Interference in the history of Ukraine. Borscht and verenyki have long been a tradition of Ukrainian cuisine, but Russia has pressed our history so much that even a countryman does not know about his country.
For the most part, she eats like normal people. I was expecting her to say she has a chef at home. And the way she talks about her mom's food makes me want to try Russian/Ukrainian food. Sounds yummy 😋. If she doesn't learn her mom's recipes, she's going to regret it.
❤❤❤⬜🟦🟥❤❤❤⬜🟦🟥
Borshch is UKRAINIAN soup. It never been Russian soup😡. Did you forgot that you born in Ukraine? Didn’t you?
Borscht is a UKRAINEAN dish 🤦‍♀️ Dumplings is a chinese dish
Having Ukrainian roots, Mila for some reason does not separate Russians and Ukrainians. Having moved to America at the age of eight, she did not get rid of the concept of "Soviet Union" in her mind. And to call Ukrainian borsch "Russian soup with beets" is the height of cynicism when your former compatriots are killed by Russians... 😡😡😡
Ukrainians really appreciate Mila's help, but for every normal Ukrainian the question of their national and cultural heritage and assets is very important. Because russia has been stealing everything from us all its life, passing it off as its own and trying to destroy the Ukrainian identity throughout its entire existence. Now they even got to the borsch. Its  very sad that the Soviet thinking of some people hasnt yet erased from their heads and they dont know elementary things, while broadcasting to a large audience and once again driving Ukrainians and russians under the sign of equality. We are absolutely two different nations, were and are.  Borsch is a traditional Ukrainian dish, and russians have cabbage soup. You should know that.
I love her 😂
Finally Mila says it about Borsch, Vareniki & Pelmeni. 😍 Yes, they are Russian dishes.
Thumbs up, Mila! Na Zdorovie!
Borsch is a Ukrainian  soup!!!
ХУМУС РУССКАЕ БЛЮДО!!!
There are so many idiots debating whether borsh is a Russian or Ukrainian dish. Who cares??? This is like the endless debates if baklava is Greek or Turkish. LOL
call borscht and vareniki Russian dishes ☠️☠️☠️
Ёп вашу мать, борщ не поделили!  По мне так с говядиной - русский, со свининой и галушками - украинский. Мне однажды борщ приготовила украинка, ничего общего с русским борщом!
Borsch is Ukrainian, not russian🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
I don't belive she cooks, she has people to do it, it s so fake
There is a huge difference between russians and Ukrainians!
Borscht is UKRAINIAN dish !
She is American, born in USSR. You don’t have to identify with someone to help them get through difficult times. She’s a woman of a great heart and generosity. God bless Mila and her family.
Borsch is literally a Ukrainian traditional meal, a protected Ukrainian heritage, it is not russian. she is interchanging “russian” and “ukrainian” as if those are the same thing which they are NOT. different countries, different nations, different cultures. for her to be making such a comment at a time of russia’s horrible war in Ukraine is literally absurd, considering how much her and her husband have done for Ukraine. back in spring she enjoyed talking about being Ukrainian, what happened now? is it out of style already?
Mila, borsch and varenyky are Ukrainian dishes!
Girl u should decide already whether u are russian or ukrainian. it's killing me
What's wrong with you, Mila? You were born in Ukraine. How dare you get confused about Ukrainians and russians? Moreover, nowadays when russian's terrorist state started the war against Ukraine, killing our civilians and destroying our homes. Your motherland, Mila...
ПОЗОР ЧЕРНІВЧАНЦІ!!!!!!!!!!!!не знати що борщ,вареники-це УКРАЇНСЬКА  страва?!??????!!!
Borsh is also russian dish:) Learn history and you will never forget it:)
Очень правильно называть это русским. Это определяет реальную глубину этой культуры!
Конечно борщ русское блюдо. Когда его стали есть, были только русские ) Малороссов, великороссов, белоруссов всех называли русскими! И везде готовили борщ. Есть нынешний украинский вариант борщ с салом и фасолью и без поджарок, а есть русский классический борщ без сала и фасоли. Кому как нравится ) Это как плов, нельзя его монополизировать только одной нации.
"we are living in times when I don't know how to call myself anymore"  Honestly? What is the identity problem?
That's sooo weird that Mila and her husband helps Ukrainians and raises funds for Ukraine, because of russian invasion. And still she doesn't know who is she russian or Ukrainian and she forgets that beetroot soup from her childhood is Ukrainian national dish🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Ukrainian or russian? She doesn’t know how to call herself anymore? What? How can she not know the difference after 9 months of war…
BORSCH and VARENYKY are UKRAINIAN! And so are you Mila!
C'mon guys! Borsch is a belorusian national dish, not ukrainian or russian 😂
Mila, the ninth month of the war, and you still continue to promote the idea that Russians and Ukrainians are "братскіє народи" with a common culture and history.  Нundreds of Ukrainians die every day, because Russia still believes that it is saving Ukrainians
Borscht is a Ukrainian national dish, not a Russian one. It is disgusting to hear when, during Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the mass genocide of Ukrainians by the hands of Russians, someone attributes a Ukrainian national dish to the Russians who are killing Ukrainians.
Im dissapointed( Living in a time when you dont know how to call yourself? Seriously? For the starters, dont help russia to steal our culture, no more!
Borshch is UKRAINIAN soup. It never been Russian soup😡. Did you forgot that you born in Ukraine? Didn’t you?
How can a person be so confused about her heritage ? She was born in Ukraine and she seemed to realize that and now she's confused again? That's an insult to all Ukrainians who's loved ones were slaughtered by terrorussians.
Ukraine=Russia common 🥱
Why she identifies borsch as Russian dish?? It's Ukrainian. Wtf? Can she identify herself finally 😐
Ridiculous! She start calling herself Ukrainian just because of russian attack. To difficult for her to remember what nationality she is? !
She supported Ukraine at the beginning of the war but it is strange that she does not know how to identify herself. And borsch is traditional Ukrainian dish, not russian, learn it already
If she is not aware of her ethnic identity, it does not mean that Ukraine and Russia should be mixed up.
If you don't know what to call yourself, it's not a plausible thing to put Ukrainians and russians together. And one more thing. Borscht isn't "very russian" and is not russian at all. Borscht belongs to Ukranian cultural heritage. If one is not into digging up the truth, etc., just don't annihilate the sense the Ukranians have been building up and are still giving their lives for.
Borshch and varenyky are national Ukrainian cuisine!
borscht is not russian, stop being such maloroska
"Russian or Ukrainians, I know we're living in a time where I don't even know what to call myself anymore" WTF????? Mila, have you lost your mind?? I wonder if she even thinks before she says something...
Borshch is Ukrainian🤡 Americans
Borscht is Ukrainian authentic soup. ( Russian is schi@soup- is not a similar). Vareniki is authentic Ukrainian food. Pelmeni is Chinese food. Mila isn’t educated person. She was born in a Jewish family  in Ukraine and doesn’t know who is she?
Borsch is Ukrainian food. Not russian. It's silly for an adult person still not to understand who she is
not funny.  mancourt
All Ukraine is furious with such words!
UNESCO includes Ukrainian borscht in the list of intangible cultural heritage. It's a shame that you, as if you're a Ukrainian woman, talk such nonsense about Ukrainian food, calling it russian.
'varenyky and borsch - russian meals'.. OMG...borsch in the brain
russians steal everything, they are only good at terrorism. And while Ukraine is shelled and left without an energy system, it is strange to talk about stolen "russian" cuisine
I love how low IQ celebs are calling Ukrainian cuisine ‘Russian’ and are pretending they know what they are talking about. Cultureless americans who are pretending they have roots should educate a bit at the very least
Kunis and Cunnilingus are  different things?
Borscht is an exclusively Ukrainian dish, in russia it is shchi
Shut up, Meg!
Did she say Dihi? She meant Dahi?
You were born in Ukraine but you don't know whether you are russian or Ukrainian. You could at least bother to not say it in public in such a difficult for all Ukrainians time. That's just pathetic
Mila was born in Ukraine and raised Jewish… and now she tells about Russian food. Actually Chernovtsy where she was born is Ukrainian city where people speak Ukrainian. But she is not Ukrainian and like all Jews in Ukraine she learned only Russian and ate “Russian food” as they always thought. They even never thought about the difference between Ukrainian und Russian traditions. For Jews everything was only Russian and they were proud of it.
Mila thinks like all Russian, every meal from east is Russian. She even doesn’t know that Borscht is Ukrainian and sour Shchi is Russian. She was born in Ukraine and knows nothing about this country. She wanted to show how cool she is, but indeed she has no idea. Go on eating Russian food, Mila. It suits to you
She is real russian. Not Ukrainian.
Borshch is a traditional Ukrainian soup, as well as dumplings (varenyky). Very disappointed with you Mila if you can't SEE the difference between Ukrainian and Russian food, as well as history, language and other peculiarities. I recommend to investigate more about your roots, Mila and finally decide how you can call yourself Ukrainian or Russian. Good luck!
Are you crazy, Mila? As a Ukrainian native you should know that Borsh and Vareniki are DEFINITELY NoT RUZZIAN food, at least they're SLAVIC BUT NOT RUS, AND PROBABLY YOU SHOULD ASK BAZAAR TO DELETE THIS KIND OF BULSHIT, COS MOST OF THESE FOOD - UKRAINIAN!!!!!!!
Russian Borsh is something like Russian pizza.
Exept that these few dishes are not russian and have never been a part of russian cuisine. Borshch and varenyky are national Ukrainian cuisine. well she s Ukrainian (she said that before as well)
It's better not to talk about things you know nothing about not to look stupid. russian dishes are shchi, kulibiaka and kulich. Almost everything else is stolen from others
I love her energy
Dear Mila, as a Ukrainian I’m super grateful for all your help before… but the message you send here is horrible… there is no grey zone in the area of war… you are either Ukrainian and support Ukraine as any civilized person in the world or you are russian and then well go live in russia and join some other celebrities who are supporting that horrible country in their desire to destroy Ukraine and kill every Ukrainian
How to show that you are stupid, cynical and far from real life? To say everything that russians say. №2 alina kabayeva is similar.
Цинічна любителька долларів.
-> Doesn't know if she's russian or Ukrainian -> Proceeds to name 5 Ukrainian dishes and 1 russian  Really, so hard to know.   If you're Jewish - say you're Jewish and be proud of that. Saying you can't draw a line between russians and Ukrainians only serves russians and no one else.
so you are hyping on being ukrainian, and then say that you do not know how to call yourself? lol calling ukrainian national cusine russian is digusting. How could you hype on being ukrainian, "support ukraine" in this war and then say something like this? Ridiculous.
Please, Help Mila to differ Ukrainians from russians. Shame on you.
this video triggered my russophobia
this is NOT RUSSIAN DISHES
I’m just curious how many more Ukrainians should die before you finally start see the difference between us? Borsh is Ukrainian dish that is recognized as Ukrainian heritage by UNESCO.
she cannot distinguish Russian from Ukrainian... calls Ukrainian dishes Russian. now I know that for her Ukrainian origin is just another way to promote herself  disappointment
Borshch and vareniki is only a Ukrainian cuisine, with russia trying to steal them to their culture as they want to occupy Ukraine because of their imperialsts nature.
Borscht is a Ukrainian cousin, and Pelmeni is russian, as simple as that!
Borscht is a Ukrainian national dish which was appropriated but Russians and Mila apparently doesn’t see the difference between the two nations.
So strange that after 8 months of full scale war you still promote Russian food and say that borscht is Russian, although it’s Ukrainian!
I can’t bear the cringe when she can’t tell russian from Ukrainian.
Did she say “russian borscht”? “russian varenyky”? What a dumb. How come you can be born in Ukraine and still do not differentiate between Ukrainian and russian? Stop this planet.
Sorry, is she dumb or what? She is Ukrainian and call herself Russian? Talks about Russian food when what she says is specifically Ukrainian meals? What the damn hell was that?
Why does she call Ukrainian food “russian”. She is from Ukraine, and borshch is Ukrainian as well.. There’s a big difference nowadays, we need to emphasise those things now to prevent Ukrainian culture appropriation by russians which lasts for centuries.
I remember them dating years ago prior to their last serious relationships. Yet i cant find much on it.. well other than the few who talked about remembering the same thing, that i came across on the mandela reddit.  Anyone else remember her dating ashton before he was w demi moore? Because they say its their first and only time as a couple. And im positive that's not true. (Atleast in one timeline.) (Oh that timeline.. 😍 how i miss you.)
Chocolate malted crunch is my favorite too!
Great Seeing Jackie look this good Seeing shes from the 70s.
She just sounds like a regular every day people.
I hear Meg Griffin.
I closed my eyes and i could visualize meg 😅
She is annoying unfortunately
Story of all moms
so boring!
Can anyone tell me where she got her brown blazer, please? @harperbazar
She’ll never be an asshole to me. Love her way too much 💜😍
Ukrainian food , not russian.
Borscht is not a russian dish ! You just absolutely don't deserve to call yourself a Ukrainian.
Borscht is not a russian dish ! You just absolutely don't deserve to call yourself a Ukrainian.
Borscht is not a russian dish ! You just absolutely don't deserve to call yourself a Ukrainian.
People don’t drink coffee first thing when you wake up.  Your body is dehydrated and needs pure water.  Drink a glass or 2 of water, wait, then have coffee.   P.S.  Dave’s Killer Bread is garbage.
Cant focus! She's too pretty lol
What a refreshing woman
@abbeysharp
Totally agree… McDonalds cones are good but machine is often broken! Lol.  Here in Nova Scotia I swear we hear  that more often than we eat the ice cream!
You shouldn't forget that you are from Ukraine, not from Russia. That ashame you don't know it Mila. We are frustrated.
is it just me does it seem like shes saying a lot without really saying much..
🤣🤣 I love the way she says "the 1st thing I EAT when I wake up is COFFEE" 🤣🤣
she just like me fr
I wonder if Ashton ever makes the kids breakfast and/or takes them to school..
I just love her personality. She’s a fantastic actress, and she seems like a great mother. Oh, and the raspberry rose flavored Poppi is amazing.
She sounds like selena gomez
Ukrainian foods especially from Ukrainian mom this is something from heaven!💛
All the dishes she called Russian are actually Ukrainian. And she came from Ukraine.
Mila is my soul sister.
Borsch is the ukrainian soup not russian. and Mila, you are from Ukraine.
MILAAAAAAAA, its my FAVORITE FOOD GROUP… I feel so seen right now
It's sad that as a parent she allows her children to run the show. They should have ZERO say in what is made and what the rest of the family is having for dinner. Every child should get only 2 choices, take it or leave it. Parents are in charge of the household and not the children. Outside of that, she is pretty awesome.
...my honest beverage of choice is wine 😆
I just love Mila. I think like most I had the wrong impression of her. But so nice to see her talking about her culture and the food. Lots of people lack culture these days. Also love that she's not strict about her diet. Makes her very relatable
I’m the same as Mila with my coffee. Traditional dark roast pour over or drip. Also I use the EXACT same creamer. Vanilla gal all the way!
What a beautiful, blessed, wholesome family! Can I come over for dinner?! ❤
Finally someone we can all relate to that doesn’t start her day with “lemon water and detox tea”
How are you that rich and NOT have a private chef 😂
Super likable
Wow After all these months After all these killed civilians After all the funds that Mila and her husband raised for Ukraine... MILA STILL DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER SHE WOULD CALL HERSELF russian OR UKRAINIAN?? Whoah What a seashell...
I watched when she redid her parents house. I know her mom is using that kitchen UP!!!!!   This girls the real deal and I’ve always loved her
Sonny's just got a huge boost in traffic and they have no idea why😆
homeless me: everything I don't eat in a day
0:27 that’s me right there, just 5 more mins because I don’t want to get out of bed yet lol
I don’t cook two meals because I’m not a restaurant. LOVE IT. Gosh I love her!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
fish is meat. they arent plants. just fyi
Y'all literally think she's giving the real story?!?!😂 She's got a chef, nanny, maid and MILLIONS of reasons to act all humble!!
I love that Mila loves ice cream and has it every night. Me too. And, guilty pleasure is McDonald’s soft serve: right size, right price, and hits the spot.
She's so naturally funny 😂 and incredibly real and relatable
How tall r u
she does not eat that much be honest
Borstch is a Ukrainian dish. And you are Ukrainian. There is a huge difference. Learn it.
God, only Ukrainians go crazy about borsch and vareniki, where it’s completely not relatable… Mila said so many beautiful things about her mother, nobody cares about whether this cousine Russian or Ukrainian, only Ukrainians, why do you keep looking for a chance to yell about yourself and put your flags around? Have some self-respect and limits, wake up!
Yes, the machines are often broken!  Truer words have never been spoken!
Сколько рекламы сделала Мила🤪
borsch is a Ukrainian dish! 🇺🇦
She's such a cutie!
She is so real… like our coffee and our breakfast is so similar… like that coffee creamer is bomb
No one cares what Meg eats in a day
💗💗💗Mila
Thank you for sharing your food choices! 😊
So cliche. A celebrity in CA that eats avocado toast, smoothies, and barely any meat. 🙄
Mila: I get food from my mom every week.  Why is this so relatable.. girl same.
How have I never noticed how much of an accent she has lol
Love her she's so relatable and humble
Varenyky and borscht are Ukrainian national dish! 🇺🇦  Very russian soup made of beets? Do you mean very Ukrainian borscht? It’s not russian food! It’ UKRAINIAN. And it’s not the same!
Borscht is a traditional Ukrainian dish. Russians stole it. This is what they do. I vividly remember the video where Mila says that her daughter is proud to be a Ukrainian and she is really proud as well. Here she can't even say where she comes from. That's weird.
Wow!! I love this girl!! REAL life! Kids and character! I bet their kids will turn out great!
I like her
I like her, but oh man, this diet looks like a typical 20 somethings youtubers diet! The coffee for breakfast, the protein smoothie for lunch or skipping lunch, and then an Instagram type of bowl for dinner.  I bet it has raw broccoli in it too. Thankfully she orders food sometimes 😂
I LOooooooOoOOVE her! Always
I can relate so much to her! She’s so down to earth. And we love Poppi too lol
Mila you are the luckiest girl alive.
I love the dill comment, the magic herb 😂 in my house oregano is the magic herb. It goes in everything lol
What does she mean work? In front of a computer? Isn’t she an actress??? What “work” does she get paid for besides acting????
She is just so humble and relatable xx
You could tell her talking about her moms cooking was taking her back. ❤
Mila is like fine wine...better as she gets older
I love how, even spending the most of her life and her entire motherhood in the US, she still gives off strong post-soviet momma vibes. For me, a Russian, she feels super relatable :D
How awesome would it be if her mom made cooking videos! I live for a good good broth. 🥰
Are you insane?! Borshch is totally Ukrainian dish, stollen by russia.  Milla who has born in Ukraine should know that!
omg Meg griffin
Has she always had this accent?
What a shame to call borshch russian dish🥲
MILA SILK OAK MILK CREAMER NOW HAS BROWN MAPLE SUGAR, PUMPKIN SPICE Too oh and egg nog! Omg drop coffee and that silk creamer is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Actually, we live in the time when you should exectly know who you are: russian or ukrainian. Sad to hear that from you
she's getting overexposed. enough already.
Mila is Ukrainian. And this video is obviously was shot before russian invasion of Ukraine. Now she’s crying and screaming for "her Ukrainian people". Good to know who she is🤥😡 Claiming everything Ukrainian as russian🤡
She is so normal, whatever’ that is. .  I love it.  ❤🎉🎉 I love Rocky road.
if youre like me and have never liked super grainy wheat bread try Dave’s killer bread 🤤 it’s the only one I like from the store, it’s so satiating
My ingredient for everything is basil. It's my catnip.
I watched Julliane Houghs before this, this cured my depression. Thanks Mila.
How can she still say Russians food when she names mostly Ukrainian dishes.
Well, Mila Kunis being herself from Ukraine should know better then calling borscht russian soup. Come on Mila, it’s the most important Ukrainian dish!
I agree with the McDonald's soft serve, they are simple and delicious. She's a real one the fact that she knows how their ice-cream machine is often broken.
Thrifty ice cream is/was the best!
Mila always used her hands a Lot to communicate
Fish is meat, ffs.
I didn’t think it was possible to love her more. She’s so authentic
I love how humble she is! ❤
Mila is so down to earth. Her parents did a great job! I also love that her parents never wanted anything from Mila's success. Even when Mila insists on treating them, they never allow it. It's just refreshing to see what a parent's unconditional love does to a person
Mila does not know that there is a difference between Russians and Ukrainians? (05:40) Interesting. And "borshch" is actually a Ukrainian dish, as well as "varenyky"...  What nonsense.
Mila has a fantastic personality
Mila, borscht is an authentic Ukrainian dish. Russians have щи.
Native American English speakers, does Mila have an accent? I thought she was born in the US.
To whoever is reading this Jesus loves you and he’s coming soon!! All you need to do to be saved is believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins was buried and came back to life on the 3rd day confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and you’ll be saved!! I hope to see you in the clouds! God bless!!!
This girl is so humble it's very impressive ❤ I'm from Poland and everything she said about her mom doing it's the same way polish people do. I'm how's Hollywood didn't change this girl love her ❤
I’d love to know how she regulates her health/stays healthy, her and Ashton both look great since that 70s show. I like eating sweets too, but it does not help keep my stomach flat. I wonder how they combat that!
I don’t wanna sound like an ass but why is getting the kids ready and making their lunch etc all on her when there’s two parents…
This is the video that I love. really who has time!? Also, as a mom, can relate so much to the coffee thing in the morning, yeap, its something I am looking forward to
She seems pretty down-to-earth.
Thrifty ice cream! When I was a kid in the Valley three scopes cost .15 cents.
RUSSIAN soup? really?
She doesn't like wasting food because she grew up poor. She gets it. And pineapple on pizza? That means she's not fuzzy, easy to work with, and is just overall chill. Love her!
McDonald’s soft serve yessss
Just came here to drop a "Shut up Meg!"
Yes! the smoked herring with boiled potatoes and fresh onions is so good!! Pickled watermelon is delicious and people who never tried it are grossed out but it is worth the try.
How come she doesn't have a nanny or help ?
Megatron
Love this, Mila is so humble and down to earth!   One thing I don’t get is why she calls food Russian when she and her family are Ukrainian.   Ukrainian heritage, food and culture has gone through centuries of appropriation by Russia and I just wish celebrities like Mila would use their voice to break this vicious circle. ❤️🙌🏼
So, Russian or Ukrainian you call yourself and your mom's food? Pick a side and stick to it
She’s my favorite person cuz she loves ice cream just as much as I do 😍😍
why did I never realise how sweet mila is!!!
Exactly how she makes her coffee, is how I make my coffee. Wth, you go mama.  Sorry no the more I get into the interview, we are plenty alike. What in the world.
Lmao! My measurements are the same. I hate it when someone asks me for a recipe. Lol!!
SHUT UP MEG
OMG, YES ! Thrifty's has the best ice cream love chocolate malted crunch and their mint chip!
Video could be 60 sec long………
If they did not show Ashton, it is like she is not the wife of Ashton. She never mentioned her famous husband's name. Just said "husband". Then the way she described work, one might think that she and her "husband" are just working somewhere. She genuinely sounds veryd down to earth.
We are aduly  we can have icecream..u r not adult so u cant have..best line
So fake. Pls Read the various books by Hollywood nannies. None of these people are hands on. They have a legion of staff including housekeeper , cook, nanny , personal assistant and one person who overseas the entire staff.
This is really down to earth. Even the ice cream part. This is mostly my life.
Please don't say Russians :)) Ukrainians is what we are ;)
My mom is like that too. I can never recreate the taste of her food. And she’s always missing one ingredient and it still taste great!
I grab bread that I have… wow. What a concept 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Best what I eat in a day, EVER
Just watched “Luckiest Girl Alive” - fantastic movie! Mila was amazing!
Dude she’s so relatable. Always have thought she’s awesome but this was just icing on the cake.
How you dare to say such things about russia and Ukraine, after russian invasion in Ukraine? It's not a joke
I love that even though she has riches and fame, she still cherishes all food and is truly grateful for everything she is fortunate enough to eat.
How could she go behind demi! Yuck! Yucky!
She is so gorgeous and down to earth.  We have same exact tastes but she must eat small portions or she is blessed with a great metabolism.  Well...she's my daughters age so maybe that is why she is so slim.   I also order only takeout of things that I don't prepare.   Great eat in a day!!
Seriously sooooo muchhhhhh seriously sorrryyyyyy?????????
Funny how she's Ukrainian and is talking about "Russian meals like borscht", which by the way is officially recognised by UNESCO as a Ukrainian dish. Such a pity to see that even amidst full-scale war against Ukraine started by Russia, Mila(of Ukrainian descent), would rather identify herself with something Russian. "I don't even know what to call myself anymore" - well don't you dare call yourself Ukrainian then.
You can not have ice cream because you are kids-my kids have ice cream;  a walking contradiction. I can see the conflicts between them and how they don’t have a great relationship. They have an ok relationship but being business relationship in Socionics they don’t seem to complement each other well.
Fish is meat...it bleeds its meat
I'm sorry, but you still dunno who are you Russian or Ukrainian :( after the war hits I thought there will be no dunno
shut up meg
Mom and good service to the rescue.
love seeing her mom life
haha I always eat left over of my kids.. love it..  and super fine with it I dont force them to eat if they dont want to but then it goes to me... so they cant come later with "im hungry"
Shes such a good vibe
Oh, I love Mila! My favorite person in Hollywood! Thank you for the video :)
Sonic has the best fast food soft serve 🍦
Borscht is Ukrainian not russian.
Oh my word we love the same ice cream!!!!WTF?!?! 👯twinsies!!
My nursing degrees advise is :    Do not eat anything????!!!!’nnn  coffffeeee is ttto acid forrrr ur pearly       Teeeeth yeah🤬
No one beats mom's cooking💚💚💚💚
I love Mila, don't get me wrong, but is it me, or does she have an accent she doesn't have in her movies, and it's kinda like that exaggerated accent some people use around little kids? Weird cuz I've watched many of her movies and never heard this accent of hers?
This says probiotics so its healthy 😂
she's dope <3
Oh this has got to be a parody.
Красотка наша ❤
Somebody who don’t wash their ass everyday can’t tell nobody nothing
she is so likable ..:-)
Ah Mila é tão fofa e graciosa RS 💖
Gosh I love her so real and beautiful
Pelmeni is Russian, varenyky and borscht are Ukrainian. Dill in everything is 1000% Ukrainian.
Yay! She’s normal. I eat like Mila 😆
She reminds me of a Midwesterner which explains why Ashton married her. She’s a gem ❤
Why did I already know before watching, that she will be quirky, relatable, down to earth, girl next door in this video? Like already the fake laughing in the beggining was cringey. There are so many actresses who feel the need to be always so cheerful, and it seems so fake that I am waiting for Caitlin Reilly to make a video of this trope.
Her voice... so raspy   ... has she a own life or only kids and husband?
Here you can see how  NON russians dishes become russian. This is a product of their propaganda.  They steal from other nations all the time
Borsch is a Ukrainian traditional food, confirmed by UNESCO
So she likes ice cream 🍨 is what I got from this. She should do a follow up and takes us around to the best ice cream shops 😂
That avocado toast SLAPS
My girl! I grew up on Thrifty Ice Cream!!
She literally came alive when she started talking about Russian food and her mom! Love it!
Her mom is literally my mom. I don't understand why it didn't pass down to me genetically lol. I wish I had her talent to do "a little bit of this" & a "little bit of that" & create an amazing Russian/Ukrainian meal.
Why all american people brush their teeth before breakfast?? It suppose to be after the food 🤣
Really enjoyed this interview.
Lol I’m married to a Latvian his grandmother taught me how to cook lol !! the herring and the dill lol so true!
Stunning
Your kom shd start a cooking channel
Mila you still don’t know who you are - Ukrainian or russian??
She’s soooo cute I can’t !
Shut up Meg hehehehe
“yes i know the machines are often broken” 😂😂😂
I love how Mila is so down to earth being a celeb she doesn't  act all uppity notice she keeps say I'm fortunate to get this or that now that is a humble person .
Does she get like 10 kinds of food delivery services? Couldnt keep count. Guess never goes into a grocery store.
When she mention her mother pickling everthing, including watermelon, I had flashbacks of my Lithuanian grandma pickling watermelon rinds! Delicious ans sweet, like candy!
Having ice cream watching this video rn lol 😂
Why is Mika Kunis all of a sudden identifying as a Russian who eats Russian food when she listed Ukrainian food (vareneky, borsch) and has spent the last eight months of Russia’s war supporting Ukraine because as she says she is Ukrainian and as far as everyone is concerned she is????
dude you’re so right about McDonals ice cream! And I forgot all about Thrifty’s ice cream as a kid!! I loved mocha almond fudge, pecan praline and pistachio!
why she keeps calling those russian meals when they technically are not? also, didn't ukraine claim sole rights over borsch? hope this is an old interview that just got posted.
Russian food or Ukrainian?! Seriously?!!! Boh
I love her
So they don't have a personal chef, or nanny, does she actually do all these things? Why am I so 🧐🤔 skeptical? 😂
I like her！She is so authentic and lovely. When she says she doesn’t waste food and mentions that her husband eats all the leftovers for Friday night, I was like that’s my life and many mommy’s life too! It’s just so down to earth. She is more like anyone else we know around us than a famous star!❤❤
She just made millions with this video 😮 all ads 😅
I love this women!
I loved her! Its like talking to a real person  and its so awkward but so culture each and lovely and authentic at the same time! Love her! 💗
I love how she’s letting us know what she sees in her head when she’s describing all of them right then & there❤
Urgh, borscht is not russian, but of course someone that doesn’t know what to call herself anymore wouldn’t know.
Gotta love a LEO!! ❤
Now we can all relate to this celebrity,right Moms? Unlike some celebrities, who has a bunch of nannies! 😂
what supplements do you take
Varenyky and Borsh are not Russian food!!! It's Ukrainian🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
How many times does she also use the toilet? Who really cares what she eats either 😂
When she said the McDonald’s ice-cream machines are often broken.. New Zealanders can relate almost every maccas you drive or go into here the ice cream machines are always broken 😂😂😂😂
So charming.  Seems she is keeping Ashton grounded
I love her Lmao
The silk oatmeal cookie creamer is my favorite ❤
Borsch is Ukrainian, not russian, what a shame!!!
So, the take away here is she barely eats....lol cool
Don’t know why but it makes me proud she’s Ukrainian like me
Those aren’t russian dishes. They always been Ukrainian dishes that russians appropriated/stole. Also her saying she doesn’t know if she’s Ukrainian or Russian? Uhm just say you’re russian its okay, embrace it lol don’t tryna say you’re Ukrainian after 30 years of being russian or however old she is. Weird asf.
5:45 she doesn’t know if she’s Ukrainian or Russian? As a Ukrainian living in states there’s nothing I can relate less to than what she just said. Like huh? It’s like saying idk if i’m Dominican or Puerto Rican these days, its just so hard to differentiate….
This is the most real, “What I eat in a Day” I have ever watched!
🤔
So cute. Tinkle. Coffee. Love her
She is so cute
Pickled watermelon is the bomb
Your mom has to make her chicken soup for us!
I love the oatmeal creamer!
Mila, you was born in UKRAINE. And russia right now kills your fellow Ukrainians in this bloody war. How dare you calling yourself russian and then saying there’s no difference… and btw, BORSHCH IS A UKRAINIAN DISH. That’s official info by UNESCO
sushi, Thai, Indian.....my top 3 food choices too!!! I knew there was a connection......lol
she's the best
You should do one with Kate beckinsale
the fact she gets her kids ready and packs there lunches is a big thing , and surprised she doesnt have a nanny
I love Mila but why did she put so much botox and filler in her face????
Refreshing! I like that you admit yo eating icecream every night, like a real human!
this format is lame.  it would be much more interesting if celebrities’s speech would be accompanied by the real shooting of their real food.  and you just steal video from the internet.  this format doesn’t fit the scale of your fabulous magazine
Who cares if it’s not organic! Just enjoy what you like.
Same on the creamer girl!!!!
So she identifies with Russia, and not Ukraine 😏
She looks so much like her Mom to me. She is so sassy, funny, and authentic.... I love her! ❤️
" 'Cause I'm not a restaurant ."  Word !
Well that was boring haha
The Jewish are famous for chicken soup my mum calls it the Jewish penesilin especially if your under the weather it’s great
So Russian or Ukrainian?
When she was talking about her mom’s chicken soup/broth 😭🤤
Also… Mila is crying because of the war in Ukraine on TV and says “ I don’t even know what to call myself anymore”…..It’s unbelievable
What’s the heck? You are Ukrainian and support Ukraine , says that your mum cooks Russian food ?!
I went to Georgia on holiday. They also have dille on everything 😂
Please invite BP members🖤💖
Borshch is ukrainian
LOVEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD THIS!
My mum's a master pickler 😄
I love that she’s actually her bad moms character 😂
Shame on her prorussian talking, such a shame to throw that even in something as trivial as food interwiev. Mila, you are expected to be ambassador of free Ukraine, not giving an examples of ignorance towards your birthland - always UKRAINE
How does a child choose to be a pescatarian ? Is there an actual meat allergy?
I love the fact that she is soooo normal ❤❤❤❤❤😊
LOVE HER❤
Weirdly relatable, with drops of "I have money" for convenience.  But very family orientated. Love it
She is a only celebrity who sounds just like normal people.Respect to her and her genuinity.
Why is Meg suddenly beautiful and likeable
I'm hungry!! Lol loved this
Great, maybe she can explain why her husband felt he didn't have enough money and had to go with his techbro buddy and scam my entire state with Covid tests that didn't work when we really needed surveillance and track-and-trace that was meaningful. All these people running around trying to get tests and having incredible lab delays only to be told that the test was inconclusive, or later finding out that lots of the results were just garbage.
She’s so amazing ❤
This is so chaotic in the best way lol I love her.
It sounds like she works out everyday 😅
It is the best creamer on the market.
Love her! ❤
My god I love her, she'll forever be my celebrity crush for every reason.
I love her soo much... would LOVE a pickling guide from her mom🖤🖤
I love that Ashton and Mila ended up together.
I love when celebrities are relatable in their food choices. This series often showcases food that the average person can’t spend the money or time making, so hearing she eats her kids leftovers and likes Thrifty/Rite-Aid ice cream is a win.
Leftover day = Mustgo night.. everything that Must go.
she's royalty for me! lady said she loves ice-cream as i do i,.. plus, she's just awesome!!!!
Hands down the most realistic one of these I've seen.  She doesn't pretend to be a master chef, or talk about her complicated Hollywood diet plan.  Love her!
This is the saddest meal day. I’m so sorry.
i cant believe this millonaire people dont have a  chef at home
Mila, borsch is not Russian soup! And you, as women with Ukrainian roots, know it very good. It was even inscribed on UNESCO's List of Intangible Cultural Heritage as Ukrainian
Fun fact I used to work at an ice cream store and was turning ppl away cuz we were closed incl Ashton and Mila they pulled a complete Karen on us he yelled at me and I cried for an hour ❤️ literally every word out of their mouths gave do you know who I am I hope they’re embarrassed
What an amazing person you are ❤
Als ich das Thumbnail sah, dachte ich es geht um Nilam^^
Why did she say that “vareniky”, “borshch” is russian meal? Obviously these ones are part of Ukrainian cuisine.
Let’s go Meg griffin
Looking like Angelina Jolie
How does she eats ice cream everyday and still be so fit 😩
She's so down to earth, real, and relatable. No sense of "I'm a celebrity" what so ever.
She's sounding exactly like my sis who is a software engineer !
Mila and Ashton eating icecream every night is iconic
Just ❤ her !! Humble, authentic and relatable ❤❤❤
Hello Mila Kunis thanks for sharing awesome and the routine cute kids amazing mother and very good and television i remember the 70 show you was so young ok sweetie blessing
Yep.. BUT BORSH is UKRAINIAN food  Peace ✌️
Wait what work do you do from home?
Borscht was recognized as an object of the intangible cultural heritage of Ukrainians by UNESCO. So it’s officially a Ukrainian dish.  Don’t blame in overreacting, now the recognition of certain things by Ukrainians is a matter of principle.
Russian killing all Ukrainian. So how are you, Mila?
Wow, very bad timing to mix russian and Ukrainian culture and ethnicity. BTW, borsch is recognized as 100% Ukrainian dish by UNESKO. It’s important to educate yourself even if you are a celebrity.
Silk almond milk creamer yes , Dave’s killer bread yes
I had a lot of respect for her and Ashton when they were raising money to help Ukraine. She was very vocal about that. What changed?? Since when Ukraine and terrorist russia became the same? She calls herself here russian, then remembers herself and slips in 'ukrainian' in there, only to quickly correct herself and say they are the same thing! Ukraine is NOT russia! Ukraine is suffering and fighting for its independence while russia is shamelessly annihilating the entire nation! Borscht is Ukrainian, vareniki are Ukrainian, pelmeni are russian and so are you! Please do NOT call yourself a Ukrainian again. Call yourself russian since it is the same to you. Did not like this.
I'm sorry Mila  but borscht is not a typical russian soup!!! It's a traditional Ukrainian dish. OMG😵‍💫 'I don't know what to call myself anymore today'. Then don't. Don't make yourself even more pathetic. If you don't know that Chernivtsi is a Ukrainian city, then I feel sorry for you. Of course, for a little jewish girl, who once moved with her family to America, there's no difference between Ukraine and russia. But for Ukrainian people it is a huge one. Especially now.  So just don't even try to do it. Don't try to make people believe that first you were russian, then you were a 'proud Ukrainian' and now you 'don't know what to call yourself. Because you will never understand what it's like when somebody is constantly trying to steal your ethnicity and identity for centuries. Although I thought you, having jewish roots, like no one  other should. You have regained your popularity because of the war now. But earlier, you didn't even wanted to be asked about the Revolution of Dignity or russian attacks in Crimea and Donbass. That's how duplicitous you are. Never liked you, never believed in your sincerity and never will.
Mila and Ashton are like the most humble and authentic celebrity couple ever. They could be eating out at restaurants every night or hire a personal chef to cook for them everyday if they wanted to. Love how real they are.
Yuuuuum!! Thrifty ice cream is the best!
I've always loved Mila, but love her even more now that I know she grew up loving Thrifty's Chocolate Malted Crunch!  😍 Always ordered that as a kid and still get that to this day!
She seems so down to earth. And that she gets how odd this series is lol. She seems so fun.
She sounds different
Love her. ❤🎉
I feel like you can toast ur bread while getting the avocado ready
She knows what’s up
Mila is so fun
borshch is not russian, it's officially Ukrainian one!
Borscht and varenyky it is UKRAINIAN food!!!
I love Mila, but the middle of this video just killed me. Crying in one video and telling that she is Ukrainian and now she says the oppisite, she does not even know what to call herself. After everything Russia did to Ukraine still calling her native food russian, girl just stop it. Just stop mentioning these two nations together and get yourself sorted.
Love her but Fishes wrong English, I’m not American but this is an example of lack of education in celebs .
What is tinkle?
Still looks amazing
Please don’t call yourself russian, we are Ukrainians! ❤ wish you love
“Russian or Ukrainian, whatever “…. is she serious?
Borsch is a traditional Ukrainian dish. You mention a lot of Ukrainian dishes but call it Russian.
Borsch is Ukrainian soup!!!! It's National dish!
Mila awesome 😁
Borscht and vareniki are Ukrainian food!!! Not Russian
don't eat mickey d's soft serve...made with cheap seed oil...get the yogurt parfait instead...it's real dairy...just sayin'...lol
Lmao her mom is such a Ukranian baba hahaha
She is from Kyiv that’s being bombed daily right now and she doesn’t know whether to call herself Russian or Ukrainian? Borscht is Russian? That’s embarrassing.
Her eyes! They look like they were drawn by a Disney animator- she is so lovely all around.
You don't understand, she's from Ukraine. Of course the food is amazing. Americans you don't understand.
I wonder if she took a  shower today.
Had no idea she's cool like that. Love. Absolutely
OMG!!!
This so relatable and affirming! What a breath of fresh air!!!
When she starts talking about her mom and the food she makes😂 that part is soo reliable. My parents are russian and I can confirm that all russian moms are the same! Dill and pickled is what I grew up on. Pelmeni are bomb and I make them for my American husband and he loves them too!
Mila is one of my favorite role models, love her!
למה את שוכחת שאת יהודייה? מילא התבוללת עם גוי, אבל לפחות תשמרי על הילדים יהודים. תעלו לארץ.
You are Ukrainian. Strange to hear "I don`t know what to call myself anymore". Borcht is also a UKRANIAN soup.
Plzz ask this to selena gomej....
Does she have kids
This is the realest what I eat in a day that I’ve seen ❤❤❤
Now i need her workout routine, because we share the same eating habits, but not the same body! 🤣🤣🤣
mila kunis is an abso icon!
America is a great country for immigrants. Her family immigrated from Ukraine, and were able to create a great life for themselves.
👏❤️i loved the movie 🎥 luckiest girl alive! Great interview Mila...(oh boy hope your kids don't find out soon your little ice cream secret 😉😂😂😂 )love your work, u are an adorable superwoman ❤️
Gisele Bundchen needs to do this omg I would be so happy
She won me over with the Thrifty ice cream name drop
Director: " how much detail do you want in this interview?"  Mila: "yes."
My dad and I bound over our love for ice cream too😂😊
soo coffee, kids' breakfast leftovers, a protein shake, a salad and 2 bites of ice cream. got it.
Privelage. Be humble. It makes me sad.
Dietitian here! I love this FDOE and approve of the protein smoothie ❤😉
I want her mum's chicken broth recipe!
I love it that she's just an ordinary mum doing ordinary mum stuff :)
Silk creamer is so good! I hope she knows about the seasonal flavors (brown sugar maple and dark peppermint mocha)
Thrifty ice cream 🍨 is the best store bought ice cream! Pistachio and rocky road are my go-to's.
Balkan moms are like her mom. I have been trying to recreate my mom's chicken broth for a while also
Greetings from Ukraine🥰 💙💛 We are using dill everywhere 🤪
Та й0баный свет какой na)(yй рашани суп….
Watching these western people's food and cuisine makes me appreciate my Indian food so much. I mean what even is this..all their food is just a mix up of bread eggs veggies. That's just sad life.
The cousin tells this tale so you will imagine her nekkid, wet and soapy, prancing through her lllarge bathroom...
Poppi from shark tank
Born and raised in Chernivtsi, which is the West of Ukraine. Donates millions for Ukraine because of russian war. Calls every Ukrainian traditional meal “russian”. Doesn’t know what to call herself anymore. I have a tip for you: you’re ignorant in your privilege and have no political position. Stop embarrassing yourself.
Love Mila. She hustles and stays humble.
You know you are a mom when you start eating the lefovers 🤣🤣🤣
the borshch is an Ukrainian dish! remember that 🫶🏼
Could literally listen to a whole podcast on what she eats everyday.
Omg,Mila eats just pretty much what I eat in general. Just alike. And, all I love her!!! She's amazing in all around!
Omg ❤️ her !
When I did my vegan stint as a kid, my dad did too, even though he was known as the steak master in the extended family (my mom incidentally did not join us). I love a supportive dad.
Умница и красавица❤️
omg why do I feel like we could be really good friends lol
Chocolate malted crunch has been my favorite since childhood too!
She could have kids and she was younger
I love how she says she like her coffee all vanilla oh wee
If you love ice cream, try Jeni’s. They’re totally great.
She’s adorable.
fish is meat tho
russians or Ukrainians I don't know what to call myself anymore?????? Mila,you must be kidding me.... If you haven't figured it out yet then I think I already know the answer
Love this! Ice cream is also my favourite food! Unfortunately, I associate it with summer so I rarely eat it during other seasons. Or maybe fortunately, for my figure.
Wow.. she's so relatable..I love how often she mentioned leftovers
Yawn.
I love Mila, she is such an honest, humble, authentic queen!
It`s not russian food! It`s Ukrainian and between UA and ru is a very huge difference!
Yes girl… oat milk creamer all the way!
So nice to see a celebrity eat a balanced diet. She seems like an awesome person too!
What a beautiful women... seems to be really down to earth
Mila is such a human person, so authentic and real and lovely through and through.
Everything she said was so relatable! My MIL always brings me Ukrainian food and literally saves my week. The mommy breakfast of coffee and leftovers is the realest thing ever
Mila is so refreshing and down to earth and balanced! love it 🙂 or shall we say: her ;)
How is your alarm set at 7:00am but you have your morning coffee at 6:30am 😂
Ugh why do I feel like she’s controlled to sound relateable as possible. Imo ofcourse, she’s just been giving me that vibe ever since she’s been w her husband. Eeehhhh
You are one of my favorite actresses of all time thank you for your honesty
Dill is in almost every meal in my house, LOL. I guess this is just Russian thing
McDonald's ice cream machine isn't broken they just don't want to clean it
That's the polish way lol...dill in everything
Mila is so relatable! Love her!
Gorgeous!!
Why call yourself Russian. You are Ukrainian no ? Considering what russia is doing to ukraine you should stick to the Ukrainian roots …. 😮😢
Well she’s just a peach❤
So sad for fish, they are not seen as animals with less value and emotions.
She doesn't know what to call herself....? "times that we're living in" oh you mean the war? not tone deaf af at all Mila, sounds like you need to figure out what you want to call yourself...
… and then she told that borscht is a “russian” food🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
And now that creamer is sold out everywhere
Angelina Jolie vibes - the face
SHUT UP MEG!
Come on, Mila,  Borscht is not russian.  Not now, not ever and especially not now. They have their "szhi"
Love the advert for the Ice cream shops. Keep it 100%! You are completely rocking it.
This is my favorite one!!
This video was everywhere….I LOVE IT
I'm the same at home I like just regular drip coffee from a coffee pot it's so soothing and delicious!
Bro has nannies and all and still tries to be "relatable" like the rest of us lmao
It's a pity that you don't feel a deference between Ukrainians and russians. You don’t remember where you were born?
Random history & geography lesson, from a Romanian who loves her: Mila was born in Chernivtsi, Bukovina region. Part of the Romanian Kingdom for the first half of the 20th century, it became part of the USSR later, also at the time when she was born, and is now in Ukraine. Bonus fun facts, Natalie Portman, Fran Drescher & Lauren Bacall also have Romanian origins. And of course, we pride with our national treasure, Sebastian Stan.
💖❤️‍🔥
Went from Kutcher to my husband
BORSCHT IS UKRAINIAN!
She’s so likable ♥️
So the McDonald's in Hollywood, their ice cream machine doesn't work half the time either.😂😂😂
Beyond obsessed with her
She’s so beautiful
I will always say that Mila's eyes are the most beautiful I have ever seen. She is amazing and with that personality, pff a complete package. Precious. 💛
Who cares!
Shes too much
Sonny is going to be happy after this
I love her omg 💛
I am not sure how she is handling the days when she is on a film schedule. She must have someone who helps her with the kids at least.
Celebs do not take their own kids to school. All of them have nannies. Their PR advises them to say to the public  they do the school run but it’s rubbish. You’ll never see the likes of Mila Kunis doing the school run. Sometimes they do it like once a year so they get photographed by the paparazzi so they can perpetuate this myth that they normal ordinary parents.
Amazing
I love her M.R
I go to sleep 5 more min   Me :10
She's awesome 🥰
I love how she talks about her mama
Omg so cool to hear a celebrity talk about eating foods that are traditional in your country! I'm from Lithuania and we eat pretty much the same stuff as Ukrainians and Russians ☺️
Loving these videos 🎉❤
Borsch is Russian??😳🤕 all  life it was a Ukrainian dish. Now it is really matter
So its's non-dairy milk, non-dairy milk, but then once dinner is over - ice cream!!! Haha
my favorite drink beverage other than water is wine hahaha moood
Loveeeee her We have the same bday and born an hour apart ironically i m just like her i eat coffee too lol and i love icecream
MY GIRL!! Thrifty brand ice cream Double Malted Crunch is my childhood favorite as well!! I’m the only one in my household who likes it so I get it all to myself!💕
Bowl Night is such a legit yet underrated meal idea!
Borsch and varenyky are totally Ukrainian dishes guys ❤ It’s never been russian
silk lol sponsor her
Pickled watermelon?! How did I not think about that 🤯😍
Haha! Eating the kids leftovers and hitting that snooze alarm really hit home with this mom. She seems so cool, tries to do the best for her kids but likes to have fun with her food too. So relatable, love her spirit 💃🏾🙌🏾🤗❤️❤️❤️
This is so REAL LIFE AUTHENTIC it sounds like my life. Eating leftovers from the kids, zoom calls, and mom (in law) dropping off pierogies, soup, and SLAVIC goodness for the kids! The eating of ice cream after kids was a good touch, but in our case it's chips :D
You don't know what to call yourself anymore???!! WTF!! Oh btw, food mentioned is UKRAINIAN traditional food.
Love her! She’s so delightful 🤩
Poppi is so good!! Love that she shouts out smaller companies
So cute ! I do have the frothing device , is almost a year now , and never use it ! But your coffee sounds delish 🙂
She was paid for the advertising, clearly lol
I've always thought she's Ukrainian. Now she's Russian? Does she even know who she is? lol
Why would she call all these dishes russian??
I'm loving how relatable this is!!  💚
Is it me or is something about her speech different?! I'm not sure if I'm imagining it or not haha
Her voice is so annoying
My mother is from Ukraine, and my grandmother is Belarusian and taught my mom some authentic dishes. So as a child I had the best from different cousins 😁
Let’s get this straight.   Borsch (борщ) — is a national Ukrainian soup (btw, Borsch was included in the list of the intangible cultural heritage of UNESCO in 2022, as a Ukrainian national dish ☺).  Secondly, Mila was born in 1983 in Chernivtsi (Чернівці), which is a Ukrainian city, for sure 🇺🇦 As well as her parents, who lived and worked in Chernivtsi till 1991, when they emigrated to the USA all as a family. And later Mila says that she doesn’t know, how to call herself and her nationality anymore. Why? What has changed?  Well, yes. We are living in a time when difference matter. Ukraine is not russia.
Wow she has similar food routine as me. I also hate wasting food and make sure I eat everything in my fridge before I buy or order more food.
Without a doubt... the most REAL and relatable episode from What I Eat in a Day 👏 Finally!!
Women can’t look like “her” lol she is a MTF
She has aged so well. More gorgeous now than 15 years ago!
I love her and her husband. And I love these videos. ❤️👍🏻
I’m polish and yes…dill is a magical herb 😂
I don’t know what I was expecting when I clicked on this, but it was so refreshing to hear everything she had to say. I love that she is conscientious about not wasting food, and is honest about just eating like an average person – no pretension.
DILL ❤
Ну от ляпнула про російську їжу, думаючи що це то саме що українська, і всі в коментарях почали обговорювати саме російську їжу. Ну скільки можна.
This is why it bugs me when people say Jennifer Lawrence is ‘relatable’. JL WANTS to be this and forces it. Mila is the real deal
My god I hadn’t seen much of Mila until her recent ‘career timeline’ video and this and sacs to say I LOVE her
Love her voice and so beautiful face😍
"We are living in a time where idk what to call myself anymore" YES. Someone from Hollywood gets the insanity lol
This is weird but I love how she doesn't name drop her husband. Like they're such a couple next door married couple even though they're Hollywood, she just refers to him as her husband and not like "Ashton" . That's just my weird brain but it's refreshing lol
She's such a Leo, love her
This is the absolute best one yet
The first thing I eat when I wake up, is coffee                                           -Mila Kunis
Disgusting and extremely wannabe healthy ...sooo fake shit
🤣🤣 so maccas ice cream machines are always broken in the states too? Thought it was just in australia haha
SHUT UP MEG
The gainful loan italy obtain because condor histomorphometrically desert worth a overjoyed viola. hollow,  far-flung crab
😁❣️
Omg that’s my favorite coffee creamer!!
These are so good! Love Mika. Luckiest girl alive was traumatizing! Too much stimulation on these young minds
Tells what type of pizza everyone likes but herself lol
We are a silk oat milk vanilla house too! It is just the best
Little dill? Woman don’t be lying we like all the dill in the world and all the pickled herring 😂
Varenyky and borscht are Ukrainian meals. Anyway, a nice video.
OMG SOOOOOOOOOOO BORING 🙄
Immigrant/refugee moms make the best broth bc there’s a tradition of actually making broth in many cultures
Doesn't she own slaves? strange?!
Because i am not a restaurant lol totally relatable
I love Mila so sweet and down to earth awesome personality i can see why Ashton married her and loves her.
i love her i love her personality she's so relatable
The first thing she really eats when she wakes up is the Ashton D
Mila is the cutest thing ever it’s inevitable not to love her 😂❤️
Poppi beverages are tasty as a treat (because of cost)
Omg 😭I’m obsessed with the same creamer 🙏😋
She is just so cute like how she explains it I am like “yeah that is how I feed myself & family”
She’s absolutely adorable 😆 I love her ❤
Ugh I adore her
The movie needs a trigger warning
Bless her. As a fellow mom I can pinpoint EXACTLY when she stopped eating breakfast early. When the kids started going to school 😂. Me too girl! I used to eat breakfast and now I dont have time 😂
I wanna be her friend so bad. Like how can you not love Mila? 😊
Close your eyes and you can literally hear Megatron
As a person who was born in Ukraine, you should know that borsch is a Ukrainian dish and not a Russian one.. it's a shame that you don't know such facts..
So what exactly is the point of doing dairy free if you eat ice cream every night? Lol
love how realistic she and that she doesn't like to waste food even with all that money!
Mila is the only person outside of my family that knows what pickled watermelon is! Awesome
I'm so grateful that Eastern Europeans have some representation through her. Love the Ukrainian food she mentioned, and more people need to give it a chance ! it's so yummy
Lol she seems like a normal relatable celbs most of celbs would be talking about some fancy expensive stuff lol
She's so highly likable ❤️❤️❤️
She brushes her teeth and then has coffee. 😆
As a Russian,yes our food is bomb
Sounds like she doesn't really eat lol just "sometimes"
I love her! She’s hilarious! Just because your famous didn’t mean your not human.
She gave a Thrifty shout out! That's some CA pride right there. I wonder if she has the scoop?
Ha! My family is from Ukraine there is dill in Every. Single. Meal. It makes me smile.
Thank you for supporting WILD CAUGHT ALASKAN SALMON!!!
She's so funny and relatable
I love Dave’s Killer Bread. Had to stop buying it when I found out the owners are huge Trump supporters. Sometimes you have to sacrifice in order to not be a hypocrite. My few dollars each week won’t shut them down, but at least I’m not supporting them either.
She's my spirit animal.  We eat the exact same breakfast.
I swear to god .. she’s the most relatable😂 literally a regular mom😊
❤
Thrifty ice cream is da best!!❤
my russian mom ist the same, puts dill in everything 😭
I love her so much! 🤭🤭 she’s adorable x
Mila,it’s strange that you told that you are Russian in nowadays situation.
I love the part where she says mommy and daddy can and you can not and that's okay !
Mostly cause we had winters.    Ooh smoke herring.  I can tell  this is my heritage top.
How sweet and authentic she is!
My mom is exactly that, lol . Her chicken broth is outstanding and its a little this a little that....😆. Luv this girl!!
Funny how rich ass celebrities act like they are so busy and cook everything for the kids, lol not like they have a bunch of help 😂😂😂
8:40 On Poppi soda: No, it is not good for you. Fruit juice from concentrate and "Natural Flavors" (which are never natural), processed stevia. Just learn to read ingredients and what they mean, you will be able to discern what is good for you and not. In general, eat whole foods that nature created, not food that was produced in a factory, your body will treat you better and you'll deter cancer and autoimmune disease.
I just love her. I’ve loved her since that 70’s show.
Hello harper bazaar i am from Singapore i am 40 years old. Honestly Mila Kunis is 1 of my favourite actress. I like her as Lily in the black swan. Thank u so much for sharing with us Mila Kunis daily dining routine
Astons nuts.....
Who cares what celebrities eat in a day? There are people in the world that have nothing to eat for the next week! The world is sick.
I love that for millionaires she and her husband are so normal
i love you mila kunis ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Mila Kunis is just amazing!
Do Uncle Rodger / Nigel Ng
Mila, you should know more about Ukrainian food and culture and don't name it russian.
Can tell she eats a little
Shut up Meg
@andrewlowe ready for u to do this one
My pizza choice is the same as Milas daughter haha. Pineapple and Olives. I thought I was alone!
Dill is amazing!!
I could listen to Mila talk about anything. So enthusiastic and passionate about everything haha. I just love her!
Loved luckiest girl alive and love mila she’s so wonderful!
Omg meg eats all these things?
I TaKe food tp myndaughter always!
shut up meg
This was genuinely the only one of these that I have ever watched through to the end 😅
So she basically can cook an egg, cut an avocado, make a salad, sometimes make toast, have her mom cook, or order a delivery service. 😂 I still like her though I can't relate.
Ukrainian pickled tomatoes were my GoTo when I was pregnant and I’m not Ukrainian or Russian!
3:32 I legit thought it was Demi Moore 😬
' Ukraines only mistake was showing r*****a the world and the world to r******a' they are Kyivan Rus. Her upbringing must have been very different to mine. Nazis and communists were joint enemy for work camp survivors who'd just come out of the holodomor
I'm Ukrainian background. We've NEVER said we're orcs. Not even for quickness of explanation. Closest my family do is saying Poland as it's where our elders left from post WW2
They sell the thrifty brand ice cream scoop like they used in the store on amazon
I want to know how she stays so slim with all the ice cream!😂
Definitely this video was shot before Feb 24th.
So she just goes downstairs makes breakfast and lunch for her kids? You mean to tell me she has no help no nanny
I absolutely loved producing Mila in this video! How real is she?! Hope you all love it!
So what I gathered is that Mila Kunis eats leftovers
I use the exact same creamer!  I'm specific about it too 🙂
I’m not even fully done through the video and she’s talking about all the food her mom makes and I’m sitting here hungry now.  Can her and her mom please make a YouTube channel or cooking show for her mom to show us how all these things are done
She’s authentic but all the ads dropped in casually 😂
Borsch and vareniki are not Russian food, it's Ukrainian cuisine.
I think we eat the EXACT same things!! 😄🙌🏻
This was breath of fresh air and so authentic!  very relatable.  💜
I enjoyed this. I love detailed she was. I thought they would be more Hollywood so it's refreshing their lives sound some what normal. Rich but normal. I know they have a fricken amazing house and so they should but I still imagined them having a chef or at least a cook who precooks their favourite foods for them and leaves them all prepared in the fridge or a food service which she did mention but only two nights a week. That's surprising, I fully expected 7 days not 2. And I imagined them having someone who does their groceries for them and keeps there cupboards stocked. They sound super normal and a good team. I really enjoyed this. Hopefully more celebrities do these food diaries and as honest as mila described.
Dear Russian and Ukrainian guys,  According Wikipedia Mila Kunis comes from a Jewish family and has cited antisemitism in the Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family's move to the United States. She has stated that her parents "raised Jewish as much as they could".  She is nothing to do with your culinary definition
She is absolutely gorgeous , everything about her
So I love that what I eat is the same as Mila.. I’m good. 👍🤣
She eats real food wow, I thought she had a chef at home nope.... thrifty ice cream so fancy. 😊 I love her.
crossing my fingers andrew lowe follows her tutorial lol
Peter and Lois raised you well 😂
Totally agree…McDonald’s 🍦❤️🙌
Even Mila Kunis knows McDonald’s ice cream machine is always broken 😂 Dang McDonalds. You gotta get your life together!
Thank you for being freakin normal!! ❤
Does anyone know where her blazer is from?
Love
I love her
I like that she made herself seem like a diva with her coffee order and all it was was that she liked a specific creamer. I was expecting her to have like multiple ingredients, prepared in a certain way or something but she was like nah got a frother on Amazon and that's it. 😂
This is the best I’ve seen in this series yet!
Best food video ever. So real.
Borshch isn’t russian soup, it’s Ukrainian national dish
Like it
6:09 that is meme material
5:47 “Russian… Or Ukrainian. We’re living in a time where I don’t even know what to call myself”. Being born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, and knowing there is a war of Russia against Ukraine happening - that is a very weird comment Mila made in this video.
What’s with the cartoons on the side? Please ✋
She said she's living in a time where she dosent know what to call herself🤣 totally relatable.
She’s extremely beautiful and sexy.  Она очень красивая и сексуальная. 😁 🇺🇦
Pickled watermelon it’s amazing😍
Ukrainian food: just put dill on it🤨
So down to earth and normal..  wastes nothing
Mila Kunis is everything
Did she just call Hummus a dip 🥴🥴
5:48 we're living in a time when russians commit genocide of Ukrainians, killing and raping civilians, bombing peaceful cities every day — for almost 8 months — precisely because Ukrainians want to remain Ukrainians and develop their democratic country. When russia is a terrorist state, nothing more. Shame on you, Mila, and the editors of this video for broadcasting such a message.
I love that her favorite food is ice cream-and that she actually eats it every day. We love a relatable queen!
I love ice cream too. It can be freezing out and I still want to eat ice cream 🍦 🍨
Hah ..I'm From Thailand and when I heard she said about Thai foods 🇹🇭 ❤️ I knew it
I just love how real she is. She isn’t trying to sound “healthy” and I eat amazingly. It’s just so realistic and I love that
Where she from?
omg mila is so down to earth and fun. LOVE 😍
So Mila Kunis likes Indian food.❤️
My take away is she is a really cool person and her family is grounded. I like that they eat the bruised banana and eat what is already in the fridge and most of all I love that their family's personal chef is grandma. That is immensely traditional and really awesome as a kid to grow up knowing and loving
Russian or Ukrainian.. she doesn't know which world we living in... can i send you some pictures or videos where children are dying so you can decide in wich world we livin in.. shame on you Mila Kunis!!! 😡
As a mother, eating your kids' leftovers is very relatable, so is the "I don't make two meals, I'm not a restaurant" :)
Ohhhh Mila Borsht is a Ukrainian UNESCO heritage! Nothing about “Very russian soup”💛💙
Ааааааа Міла Борщ це українська спадщина «ЮНЕСКО», який  там «вері рашн суп» ?!
She got me at thrifty rocky road. That’s the shiz
thrifty chocolate malted crunch! 🙌
Love herrrrr she’s the sister I never had 🥰
I love how chaotic this video is
Yes Sonny’s ice cream!!! So good it’s in Sherman Oaks
This literally is the best interview!she is not a restaurant..lol..I hear yuh!neither am I!I cook you wat it or starve!lol
Borsch is a UKRAINIAN DISH!!!🇺🇦  While Russia attacked Ukraine, it matters!!!
Thrifty's chocolate malted crunch if for real the goat
Love her authentic self and honesty
This is so ridiculous. Millions of cows spend their days watching what some illiterate Hollywood preschool dropouts without any sense of ethics eat or wear. Of course, what else can humans do with their lives?
Chocolate Malted and Rocky Road are my favorites too. Mila is the most beautiful woman in the world.
i can feel the happy family vibes, wish them the best, also didn't know she is from russia
Such a relatable down to earth person!  Healthy eating, not wasteful AND ice cream every night!  She's the coolest!
She is so down to earth. Love how genuine and relatable she is :) I love thrifty ice cream too! The same exact flavors!
I’m a dietitian and I approve of your smoothie for lunch. 😋
I just watched "Luckiest Girl Alive" , its a sexual violence based movie but its so different from the rest of the this kind .
Your so beautiful and down to earth.  Love you both. 🐾🖤🐾🐾🐾
"Borscht is a Russian soup". What? O_o
What’s up with the Russian food. Mila, please, don’t do this. You yourself said that you are from Ukraine, and all the food you mentioned is very much Ukrainian 😢
She is so relatable and I bet she’s a wonderful person IRL
Film your mother making that broth. You’ll continue that tradition. Pass it onto your kids. Keep it in your family.
This video is about what you eat, I don't think anybody really cares about your bathroom habits. I wonder if that's nervousness or just narcissism?
Wow! She's my food soul mate.
She is so adorable and relatable.
Finally a normal day in the life. You can tell she's good a healthy physical, mental and family life. I really hope they appreciate each other
I love the fact that she eats like a normal person!
We can be friends she’s not Extra she’s normal and relatable ❤
EVERYTHING BUT THE BAGEL!
ICE CREAM IS MY FAVORITE FOOD GROUP!
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL!
MILA IS SO RELATABLE!
Calling herself Ukrainian right after the invasion to be trendier and later calling many of her national dishes "Russiany" shows how phony all her previous claims were.
Mila, you would LOVE Costco’s soft serve ice cream, even better than McDonald’s (and a better value)!! 🍦
Thrifty’s chocolate malted crunch is my all time childhood favorite as well!!
I just saw her new Netflix movie. Very good. Respectfully, am imagining that there is something going with her cheekbones? Maybe it's the lighting plus makeup? But after watching the Johnny and amber case, I'm wondering if it's a new Hollywood "procedure?" I'm just curious. No offense.
The US media never gave two shakes about Mila K but I guess theyll milk her now cos she was born in Ukraine. You Americans are so predictable with your propaganda I'm amazed why your own people still havnt figured out your cheap shots at attention. Each war in the past 100 years has been initiated by US and its allies in NATO. Go on Mila tell us all how bad the Russians are and how well you are being paid to sing praises of your corrupt nature nation and the one who fostered you to-date. Bloody degenerate
I love Mila...she is so down to earth   and is such a beautiful soul💗
I like ole skool drip coffee too. K cups suck!
i love that she loves chocolate malted crunch from Thrifty's
She’s not real Ukrainian  The hell Russian borsch??? That’s offensive Mila
????? Why
Im not buying it. She's on a strict diet, highest quality ingredients
Omggg, I love the same Thrifty's ice cream!!! 🥰
Vareniki ❤️❤️❤️
So Sexy ❤❤❤
Mila: “everything she makes has dill in it” Me: I need to go to mila’s mom’s house for dinner
Hahaha soooo relatable!!😂
Like her
lol that was quite detailed
I’m here for poppi and oli pop
I love how honest she is!😄 I adore her!
This is what I've always wanted 🥲
Shut up meg
I just love her. That lady managed to stay REAL throughout the years in Hollywood. Huge respect and love for her
Mila Kunis being Ukrainian and her stories just reminds me of my mother ❤️
I was sure they had food related habits as a family that do not generate enourmous amounts of waste and co2 emissions! Dissapointed.
Oh wow let's all sht our pants.
Watch dominion on YouTube to see the truth about your food
Yes the thrifty brand Rocky road! Childhood flavor yummy 😋 there’s nothing like it.
What does Ashton does in all this? If she does the child caretaking and the cooking?
"I don't cook two separate meals because I'm not a restaurant." I felt that.
I lovedddd luckiest girl alive it was sooo good❤
Wow the fact this is a whole feature
I love this video. She is just to relatable. I am her mom cooking, little this and lot of that. Then here you go. Then someone says that's good. What's the recipe? Well.....
That’s so frustrating that in this video, Mila says that “varenyky” and “borscht” are russian meals!!! They’re not russian! They’re Ukrainian! And Mila knows this for sure! Because she is from Chernivtsi, a city in the western Ukraine! And in the other videos, Milan’s always that proud that she’s Ukrainian - so what’s wrong with you here? At what f*cking point borscht has become russian meal????
The fallacious crib covalently amuse because command individually need afore a brave egg. rambunctious, brown sphere
Guys, are You even serious? Do You know, that there is a war in Ukraine right now because of russia? This video is Your voice! “I don’t know what to call myself”? “russian or ukrainian”? There is a huge difference, You know. It just hurts. And борщ is not a russian dish! It is ukrainian national dish and it always was.
And she manages her kitchen by herself?? No house help??
I adore her so much
I wonder if she uses Hello Fresh? Like, what's that meal delivery service she's talking ab
Dang she lives all middle class!
its water….😃
By the way, dumplings and borscht are not russian. It's disgusting to hear this, especially after she said that she's proud to be Ukrainian.
She has adhd 😂
Witch.
I love anything made from oats.
Mila ❤️
When she mentioned Leftover Fridays, it made me think of Malcolm in the Middle where Lois makes Leftover Parfait, and how she throws all of the leftovers from the week into a bake and Malcolm looks at it and says "It finally happened.  The 5th level of this week's Leftover Parfait is last week's Leftover Parfait."
A glass of wine is also my beverage of choice Mila. You're my people for eating leftovers also. Bloody love you ❤️😘
When my daughter was 4 I heard her little feet coming towards the kitchen And it was too late to hide anything! I knew I was caught And she came running around the corner As I turned around with something sweet (can remember now I think ice cream)  And she threw her hands on her hips and said “WELL, well, well- what do we have here?!” She’s a teenager now but I think about it often and laugh
Would love to know her  workout routine too
this is the most realistic one I have watched
So basically she rarely cooks anything. She either has protein shakes, take outs, her mom’s food, Friday is leftover day and she sometimes makes vegetables with an occasional fish. Which is fine, too.
The Old Country chicken soup from my gram is the absolute best…when she talked about her mothers chicken soup, it made me smile
This is by far the best food diaries Harper's has ever done. Mila is so real!
Hollywood diet is goddawful; always oat meals, avocados and smoothies. I'd rather be chunky.
IMHO: noone! espeacially not now! should have the right to call themselfs "ukrainian" if they grew up eating "russian food"
I love Thrifty/Rite Aid, Chocolate Malted Crunch! I, haven't had in 30 years or so though now living in Oklahoma but glad it's still being made.
Hearing her talk about her mom’s meals ❤
So pretty and humble lady...Very down to earth 💕
Old school drip coffee such a vibe ❤
She likes all the food I like! Crazy!
I love this woman with my whole heart.
You don't know what to name yourself anymore???
I find it odd calling herself Russian. I thought she was Ukrainian?  I like how relatable she seems.
oh No! a true ukrainian would never call themselves russian LOL
😁
At the end of the day she is a typical Jewish mom lol
10 mins in and she’s the rare celeb who hasn’t forgotten who they are. A human. We have all eaten our kids leftover food, not to waste it.
Shut up Meg....          Love u Mila! 💓
Omg I LOVE pineapple and olives on my pizza too. My husband thinks it’s disgusting but I love it. It’s sweet & salty.
My mom's go to green would be Cilantro,  and I try to follow in her footsteps 👣 ......... not very successfully 😄lol.
she is beautiful.  Inside and out . aw.
Damnit, Mila, we need Elvira's chicken soup recipe.
YES! Thrifty ice cream! Chocolate Malted Crunch!!! I have such memories of that!
I admire this type of lifestyle more than people bragging about their exclusive experiences like the Kardashians do.
Thrift yes Chocolate Malted Crunch is my favorite too!!!
That exact creamer will make my whole morning, Mila just gets it
I just love her…What a woman.
someone tell me where I can find this blazer!!!!!
With all due respect to her because she seems like a lovely person, no tea no shade. But she eats like I would imagine a celebrity would eat if they were a mom.
Silk forever, baby.
Really enjoyed this....definitely doesn't try to be something she's not.
This may have been the best one yet!
Thrifty chocolate malted crunch is the best
did she just say "russians? ukranians? i don't know what to call myself these days....?" just me who heard that?
She's adorable.
She is the most non-celebrity celebrity I’ve seen on one these and I’m here for it
Mila you are so down to earth and relatable I love you ♥️
It says brat instead of broth in the text 😂
She sounds like every other mom! I no longer feel guilty 👋
Wow that was more interesting than I thought it would be
Eating your kids’ leftovers 😂 !!! You can tell when someone was born low-income by little things like this lol
We need to see the Broth recipe 😩💖
“I don’t cook 2 separate meals. I am not a restaurant” 😂 neither do I !
This feels so relatable being a Ukrainian myself 😂 I love Mila haha
She expects us to believe that she has no people for making food? Usually rich actors have their own house staff.
we love you Mila! 💙💛 (though varenyky and borscht are Ukrainian dishes 😉)
Why can’t the kids have ice cream ??? 🫤
=))) Так рада слышать, что она до сих пор ест и любит благодаря маме русско-украинскую кухню=) Кайф! Yeeah, russian-ukrainian cousine is so delicious and healthy!
My boyfriend used to go to school with her he said he wasn't popular at all and was a nerd that no one talked to lol
my kid is a pescetarian. your kid is 8.
RIP Sonny’s
This is the REALIST celebrity what I eat in a day lol
Finally someone relatable 😅
Dear HB, time to retire what I eat in a day, what an anachronism of bullhonkey. We literally no new truth about anyone. She seems as cool as possible as she she either is eating as relatable, or eats super healthy as the only two options. But do love this acress
Nothing fancy here, she has leftovers because she doesn't like to waste food. I love her!
Oatmeal cookie my fave girl that's how I keep myself from getting starbucks I seriously thought she was going to recommended an organic ass coffee lol
typical man of east europe - we call it "by the eye"- never been able to recreate also haha
"Cause I'm not a restaurant" Yeah, she's a mom.
I love her!
Sorry but Borsch it’s ukranian dish! Not russhian!!!
The silk soy creamer is my jam. I almost can't drink coffee anywhere else or any other way. So good!
Love her ❤
I really like Mila. She’s a good actress she she soo pretty to me.
The movie is great and so does she...😍
I’m sorry what?  She sometimes tinkles and sometimes brushes her teeth? Gross
she already told us what she eats on the luckiest girl alive
I loved pelmeni when I was a kid! My mom always ads a shot of vodka. Later on, she told me technically she could just use water but prefers the alcohol. 😅
I love how she said she’s fortunate and grateful for the things she has.
@abbeysharp, this looks like a new video 😍
What does she do for work day to day when not filming? Anyone know?
I, as a Ukrainian, am very interested: what should happen to Mila Kunis and her inferiority complex, so that she remembers the difference between Russians and Ukrainians and stops calling us Russians as if it's okay. It does not. And borscht is a Ukrainian dish. Shame.
“Excuse me Miss, where did you get those nachos? They look soooo good!” - Mila Kunis approaching me once at a baseball game . My husband almost died 🤣
I love how she mentioned mcdonalds icecream/shakes machines are often broken 😂
She seems like the most down to earth, respectful and well spoken person
Did she just say “russians, Ukrainians, I don’t know what to call myself!” ?????????????? 😳 Wrong Mila, wrong.  Now next thing: “borsh is a very russian soup”. WHAT’??!!!!!! 😵‍💫 Varenyky and borsh are Ukrainian meals.  And there is a difference, Mila!
I'm sooo happy Meg is living her life!
We don’t deserve her. She’s soooo relatable! We love you Meg!
I love how relatable she is  She's so cool<3
"i dont cook two separte meals, coz im not a restaurant" hahaha i cackle
wait I LOVE Her
With all due respect, "Russian" and "Ukrainian" are so far from "interchangeable" now (in regard to Mila mentioning Ukrainian dishes like borsch and varenyky). It is pretty clear what she meant and all love to her, but we all gotta learn at some point. 🙏
Mila is sooo great
A REAL human. Not an ounce of pretension to be found. Totally relate to this diet. Totally relate to her. 🤝
Why is she talking so fast
My mom is exactly the same when it comes to recipes. No measurements just ingredients eyeballed lol
All I hear is Meg from family guy
Rocky road and Pistachios sorbet....yeeeaah...
I love smoked herring!!!
That was beyond normal 😅 loved this. Mom life is eating AFTER the kids leave
Fantastic food choices, gorgeous as always, but why refer to the food as Russian in the light of what is happening right now
She's so cool.
Her face is so symmetrical, its kinda insane 😍
All cool, but... Wtf, borshch not russian soup, but Ukrainian.  And what was that : " I know we are loving in the time where I don't know even how to call myself'😳😳😳 what was that?
How are Mila and Ashton working from home? Like aren't you guys actors don't you need to be on set?
Every time I hear Americans talk about eating habits it's so different from Spain jajaja (from Mediterranean countries I should say).  Also spanish eating times are veeeery different from the rest of the world, you should see what we have for lunch 🤣🤣🤣  Every time I travel I have to remember, "kitchens might be closed at 2 pm (lunch) or at 10 pm (dinner)"
Narcissist much?
I thought she was gonna say the first thing I eat when I enter the kitchen is... some of my money... lol.. ( just cause she rich af)
YES! I live near Sonny’s and I agree with her, so so good!!
i love her!
Damn I wasn’t expecting this to be completely relatable down to the McDonald’s soft serve
She is soooo cute!!
she seems so down to earth and authentic. ive loved her since that 70s show!
😍
I love how relatable she is ---  drip coffee with creamer and leftover food from her kids' breakfast. This is what a hands on, on-the-go Mom is. I'm also against wasting food so I just eat the leftovers. 😁
She’s probably one of those more realistic food diaries…something i would do also
1:31 whatever gets you through that morning/school Run chaos girl😂 I’m same a coffee, 10mins of my book then kids up, breakfasts, packed lunch, “mum mum mum” then out the door 🏃🏼‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️
i would rather have her talk about ice cream for 10 mins
thriftyyyyyyyyyy
Lawd. I'd be ashamed to go on this channel 😄 I'd be like...well I'm a server..so the earliest I ever have to be at work is 11am but that's just weekends so...   durin the week I sleep until at least noon & wake up & grab a coke to drink. I'm addicted to caffeine & will have horrid withdrawal headaches so that's how I start my day...  Then later I'll go to work & drink a coke while  im there...  I get home from work anywhere between 8:30pm-11:30pm. It takes me an hour or 2 after work to finally  get hungry & so I'll go get fast food that's open late or just try and find somethin at the house. Sometimes I just crave candy! So I'll go to the gas station & get a sour/chewy candy & a chocolate candy!    Lol I used to drink like 3 or 4 cokes a day BUT the past week or 2 I've gotten down to just 1 or 2 MAX and been drinkin lots of water!
Why is she talking about Russian food if she is from Ukraine? and borsch is Ukrainian dish.
Looks like she was forced to shower for this interview!
Wait! Mila is Russian!?? I'm not sure why I find that such a Surprise! I Polish and  loving this episode.
We have the same favorite Thrifty ice cream flavors 🥹❤️❤️❤️
thank you for bringing back the old editor :-)
Loveeee her
Oh I thought I was eating slightly healthy. She’s eating SO much healthier
😂❤ Mila is awesome!
She made this so fun, felt like talking to a friend.
My favorite way to drink my drip coffee too with that specific creamer! 😭
*To anyone seeing this:* I know this sounds really irritating and shameless but me and my family are literally down to our last cent. If any of you here have any extra blessings to share, even if its just a few cents, I would greatly appreciate some help. Only if you can and if you want to. I took my advance pay from my little jobs to pay bills and rent, so that we cant go homeless again, so now I dont have any receivables. Wont get paid till mid-November. I have no other intention but just to feed my family and buy pappa's meds. No, Im not from US, we dont have food banks and a good healthcare program. Im just really out of options and too desperate.  So forgive me for having you read all of this. I honestly just really need help.
The movie was great Mila!
I’ve always loved mila kunis. I love how real and relatable she is. Thanks to mila this is the first what I eat in a day that’s not annoying. Great video !! Thank you
She looks very skinny specially her face
A glass if water for breakfast and a breath of fresh air for lunch
Me: I have matured enough to see what this incredible actress eats.  3 seconds later: shut up meg
I think we all just witnessed what Ashton always saw in Mila. She's authentic, humble and appreciates the little things in life. What a gem.
I hope to be like Mila’s mom in the future with my daughter. Making food for her and her family would be a delight.  Great food diary and so the way I cook for us.
Real moms eat the damn leftovers 😅
I believe every word she says. Her honesty has won her my respect
No hate but Ukrainians/Russians she doesn't even know what to call it these days? Ukraine is still a country... and always will be.
She is honest and cute as heck! I never not watch an interview of her
I feel like she should have been catwoman instead of Ann Hathaway. Also she's great just generally
bloody love her ❤
The fact that they are normal outside of being super rich is so good to hear
ok but how can she say "russians or ucrainians, i dont even know what to call myself anymore" ?! WTF
Well I didn't really know much about her life but now I really like her. Alarmingly normal lol
Another hollyweird self entitled leftist demoncrat trying to be relevant.get this right..most just don't care what you do on a daily basis.we are too busy trying to get by
They don't eat meat  yet have fish, HELLO GORMLESS FISH IS A LIVING CREATURE JUST LIKE COW, PIGS AND CHICKENS. If you eat fish your eating a dead animal.
Rocky Road 🔥
You have a good Mom!
The way she’s yelling the whole time speaks to me. Love that.
I don't give two shats what she does
Чем хвастаться если еда в usa  одна химия  одно блаблабла😭😭😭😭😭😭😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Oh thank all the gods & goddesses!!! Most of these “harper’s bazaar food diaries” are so stupid, tone-deaf, arrogant, & entitled. I love her & how normal they are!!! They need to do more like Milla!!!!!
How do you eat ice cream every night and stay so tiny?
Who cares dummy
This is sad
I have already seen Luckiest Girl Alive. Love Mila
I would love to eat...
MEGGGG
She is a treasure❤
SO WHAT TIME SHE GET A SHOWER?🤣🤣😂😂
this is the most relatable one i’ve seen so far. i literally love mila😂
W T F did she do to her face?
Це справді незрозуміло, росіянка ви чи українка? 🤨
i don't cook two separate meals cause i'm not a restaurent 😂🤣
shut up meg
i cant stop my ear from hearing Meg
I love her
Sounds like you need more meat which BTW is healthier than vegetables, especially if it's wild game. Vegetable oils of any type are hidden killer's and vegetables in general aren't as full of nutrients and vitamins as everyone thinks. It's in soil science.

Clicked on this video to comment.  I’m so over the idea of “celebrities” and our cultures weird obsession with certain people. Honestly, it’s completely absurd. I’ve never thought about what “Mika Kunis” eats in a day because I don’t care.
I love this. These meals are so attainable with some cost accommodations for sure. And all so relatable
I think this is an old video, I don't think that Mila Kunis would call herself Russian now, now she knows for sure that she is Ukrainian😊
🥳🎓👽🛸
Love her 🥰She’s so relatable 😊
Not buying it. A true ice cream connoisseur would know their brand and they would also know Hagen Daz is the best
Also the same person with the ice cream! haha me and my husband have an unhealthy obsession as well.
It’s sad that Mila doesn’t know if she is russian or ukrainian. I believe that all her life she told to everyone that she is russian and when war started she checked her birth certificate and found there Ukraine
Haha I love that your daughter is a pescatarian. Y’all eat healthy!
Wow we are the same person! haha with the coffee and the breakfast.
💫 magic time 💫 so relatable!
wow i love her so much, even more after watching this
I would love to see Mila and Ashton on a cooking show 🤩🤩🤩
THE WORST EPISODE I HAVE SEEN SO FAR. IF U DONT COOK OR CARE FOR FOOD STAY OFF THIS
We love a realistic queen!
i was so happy to hear that her food habits are basically EXACTLY the same as my family's - as a child of russian immigrants it was literally like one or two russian dishes for the whole week and leftovers for the rest of the time:) i only started getting take out into my 20s bc my parents just did not believe in that lol
bla bla bla bla
She's no vegan?
the beet soup is so good! I love how you can hear her accent thru her english
She gets more beautiful by the minute 😫🤌🏼✨
Please don't copy this. Fish is like the most toxic food u can eat. Once a month is completely enough. All the waste of the world is dropping in the oceans and the toxic fish are the result of that 🐠😬
Пиздец как интересно 🤣🤣🤣🤪🤪
What does she do for work if she’s not acting?
Practical even down to her meals. Not too far removed. Always been pretty grounded to me.
i didnt realise she has a slight speech impediment it’s SO cute 🥹
Mila, for your information Borsch and Varenyky aren't russian dishes. IT'S UKRAINIAN. How can't you know that if you are from Ukraine, like you said in the video which was out around 10 days ago?
She is so real and down to earth. Thank you for being so real!! Loved it!!
So refreshing to hear a celebrity talk about minimising food waste!
I could eat Mila Kunis all day
Do megan fox!!
Very healthy
this bish does not eat lmao she was going around in circles to finally say she makes ashton "make his own bowl" with the vague "leftovers"
This is the least pretentious meal plan I have ever seen on this channel. Love her. What makes it even better is that they are really rich and not just Hollywood rich. They have invested in very profitable start ups.
I love how people say they know nothing of code or coding! How am I not surprised here! God bless, lovely people! Awesome life
Mila Kunis: Suddenly, I’m awake
They don't eat meat? Good god. No wonder Ashtons been looking super sickly and gaunt. Blink twice for help!
Listening to Mila talk about food is a breath of fresh air! I'm also Russian, and this resonated with me :-)
She’s delightful
no one cares Meg
How come bortsch is “very Russian soup”???? Why is she eating Ukrainian dishes and calling them “Russian”?? Wtf
Thrifty's Chocolate Malted Crunch is ELITE.
Icecream!! Love it too😋
I lived in LA many years ago. I would stand in line to get a Thrifty's triplex scoop ice cream cones for maybe $1.00. I think it was 0.25 a scoop!
I love you to the moon and back. :)
I'm obsessed with her! the "I'm not a restaurant" comment sent me lmfao <333
Are you sure that's the superstar Mila Kunis and not my mom? Cuz I promise that's exactly my mom, my sister, my boyfriend's mom and our neighbors.
This woman. The more you get to know her, the lovelier she gets ♥️
I really dont see the change
she got adhd like me
She is gorgeous 😍
The best.
My husband is Russian and her diet and how she talks about her mom reminds me so much of my other half’s family :) Love it
Every time I hear her voice I wonder where her hat and glasses have gone ...." shut it Meg " 🤭😂
God, she's a breath of fresh air...down to earth, relatable and honest. She's lovely and funny too.
I guess Kunis has decided to do a Musk and stub Ukraine in the back when the country is fighting for its life.  Not cool. Disappointed with her.
Love the tzaziki and hummus for breakfast idea 💡 and I love you Mila!!
"I love ice cream - it's my favorite food group" ♥️I just found my new best friend 😁
It is weird to hear Mila saying in one of her interviews how proud her daughter is to be half Ukrainian, and hear her not knowing whether to call herself Russian or Ukrainian in this video. Also, Borsch is not a "Russian soup" , it is a Ukrainian national dish. Now it is very important not to mix russian and Ukrainian cultures as for a very long period of time russia has been trying to steal the territories, history, traditions, cuisine and so many other things from Ukraine. And now it is stealing the lives of our people. That's why I am writing this comment and emphasizing that Ukrainian is different than Russian.
Her Russian accent like an American learned Russian, not the opposite !
Borsch is not Russian, it’s Ukrainian. C’mon Mila🙄 Even UNESCO has recognized borsch as being Ukrainian. You call yourself Ukrainian now, and your mom’s Ukrainian. You really should learn more about your culture, especially now, considering the circumstances and with your huge fan following.
About time we have another food diary. She’s so refreshing!
Mom life ❤️
Thrifty Chocolate Malted Crunch is an absolute core memory from my childhood! When I go back to my home-town I still stop by the ice cream counter for scoops! I remember walking into a Rite Aid on the NorCal coast and being gutted because they didn't have an ice cream counter!
This. Was.  Awesome.  Mila gets it.  She really gets it.  You get the sense she didn’t prepare anything for this.  She showed up, put on whatever clothes were waiting for her, sat down, and we saw in real time her walking through a typical day in her mind and just narrating for us what she saw in her head as she did so.  “I don’t prepare two meals because I’m not a restaurant.” Hahah.   I don’t know what the prize is but Mila wins it, hands down.  Most relatable celebrity interview on any subject ever.
I really love how real she always is
I knew Mila wouldn't let me down with this one. Love her.
Why does she call herself russian if she is Ukrainian?
Thrifty's 🍦 is absolutely nasty!
A girl from Chernivtsi is calling borshch r*ussian... What a shame 🤦🏼‍♀️
Although the video is fun, but one thing rises a question and another needs to be clarified.  I’ll start with clarification. Borch is an UKRAINIAN nation soup, not russian, they have shchi which is not even remotely good as UKRAINIAN borch.  And the phrase “I don’t know how to call myself anymore - Ukrainian or russian” is pretty weird, especially when Mila said in another interview, with tears in her eyes, that she is Ukrainian and her daughter is half Ukrainian. Really??? Was it just an act? 😢
You are so bzautiful to the point that i dont like you
Go take a shower sis
That creamer is the best in my opinion.
Please do not associate Ukraine with Russia. I understand that it is confusing, since we were part of the USSR, but right now it is an extremely painful comparison/association for Ukrainians, as it discredits our fight for freedom, peace and democracy. As a Ukrainian, I would really appreciate everyone’s understanding on this subject ❤ we are not ok with being compared to those who kill us and commit genocide against our nation.
💜💜
she does not age I swear
She’s a beautiful and wonderful mother 🤍🥺
This was the most relatable food diaries ever 😂😍😍 love her 💕
Yo girl, borsht is Ukrainian and you are Ukrainian.
Jeeez, the audacity to call Ukrainian traditional dishes ruzziaan? Borshch is a Ukrainian dish as well as a half of other she mentioned. What a shame and disappointment.
Shout out to the editor who complemented Mila’s storytelling so beautifully with the pictures on the right side of the screen.
she's so sweet, really love that she told us the details  😭😭😭💗
“i don’t cook seperate meals because i’m not a restaurant” A word 🤌🏽🙌🏽
she's a delight. so down to earth.
I thought she was Ukrainian….
"I don't cook two separate meals, becouse I'm not a restaurant." Yaassss sisss!!!
really? you don’t understand what is the difference between russian and Ukrainian?
Omg I'm Russian and my mom is exactly the same haha From the cooking to the dill in everything haha
Yes I'm Russian and I eat all those Russian foods. Russian food rocks!
Drink everytime she says my husband lol
I have always loved her and now I love her more!
she all around good
Okay what on earth is she doing on the computer working? Does she have another job other than acting?
russia is a terrorist state. Borsch and varenyky are ukrainian dishes. And Mila Kunis knows nothing about ukrainian culture and that ukrainians and russians are two completely different nations. Repeating appropriative imperialistic narratives is very harmful.
excuse me, but when Borcht become russian soup? It is clearly Ukrainian and it is UNESCO verified. No offence)
I love that she mentioned thrifty ice cream it's the best
guys this is so fake - she by no means eats ice cream every night.
thi is sooo fake
No pizza though!  😄
Yesterday Mila Kunis said that her daughter so happy to be half ukrainian. And today she doesn't know how to call herself russian, ukrainian, whatever?? There is a huge difference between russians and ukrainians
БОРЩ IT’S TRADITIONAL UKRAINIAN SOUP MILA
Boring
Meg ❤
russia- TERRORIST state
everyone's favorite food is Ice cream, including mine
Looovveeee mila kunis shes so down to earth!! Keeps it simple and just lives life… i will watch anything she is in well done on luckiest girl alive.. 😊😊
She's captivating! Her beauty and confidence shine through
She it beyond cute!! Love her
“Ice cream is my favourite food…group!” I’m gonna keep that information safe in my brain for always😆
You are so sweet!! Beautiful woman! Love how normal you are and love the movie! 👌
I love how she is so famous and she acts like she isn’t, she’s so humble and it’s very refreshing and that’s what I have always loved about her
No way, dude. I about flipped my computer desk. Thrifty brand Chocolate Malted Crunch has been my favorite ice cream flavor since I was a child. It's so weirdly specific I've never met someone else who even knows that brand. This is mind blowing.
The way she says 'my husband' each time 😍 As a That 70's show fan I love how Jackie finally got her Michael ❤️
and yes mcdonalds , well i love their hot fudge sundae lol, with soft serve the best.  :D
I didn’t know I could love her MORE
im laughing....i feel like the main thing Mila eats and lives for is ice cream LMAO that was her most enthusiastic part :D I got that and avacado toast lmao!
Sonny’s Sherman Oaks!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Dear Mila. You're from Chernivtsi, Ukraine. No need to identify yourself with ruzzians. I cringed while I watched you talking about ruzzian borsch and you not knowing how to identify yourself, especially after your interview where you speak about your daughter who identifies herself as Ukrainian
I bet Sonney’s no longer a snall unknown ice cream place
I love how money & fame hasn’t corrupted her. She grew up pretty poor and clearly doesn’t take anything for granted. Love her realness, I wish more celebs were like this
I will be her assistant to help her toast her bread
It’s funny how she likes her coffee the same way I do ! Lol and I actually have the same creamer but in the bottle instead of carton lol.  My boyfriend doesn’t get it, but he also only loves my coffees haha
I think that dill and parsley are most estern- European herbs ever, like of course we know basil and other mixed we'd call Italian or French , but dill , parsley, chives and this magical thing called garlic (but specific mix of garlic and some other herbs, I'm Polish so we call it "staropolski" which means "old polish garlic mix", but I'm sure other countries in the region know that too), so when you smell those you know where you are. Also Christmas smell is a mix of fish, cooked cabbage (cooked not cooking so there is a difference), cinnamon (and cardamon like for the gingerbread mix) , oranges and mushroom and it's the best thing ever. People in our region love to forage for wild mushrooms, herbs and berries. It's funny because she is from Russian - Ukrainian  culture and in Poland we have type of pierogi called Ruthenian , because old ruthenia used to be a part of Poland and it's now in Ukraine and these are dumplings with potato and quark cheese. Sometimes sprinkled with bits of bacon on top.
isnt she just adorable ? I do not know how she stays so slim and healthy looking with her non fuss habits.
I’m just now realizing Russian food (what she says she eats) is very similar to “Swedish” cuisine. Never heard anyone outside of Sweden mention stroganoff and the pickled herring with dill? So so so common here. All in all Mila is great, very authentic too!
I looove how she has very down to earth, relatable food related habits/stories. And the fact that Mila and her kids are close and get to have the ethnic dishes too is amazing. 😭❤️
OMG do I relate to this one! thank you Mila!
At least she is being realistic about it like I eat leftovers of my kids' meals etc. There's excitement when she's talking about the variety of food that she is eating. Alot of the celebrities I have seen are like repeating the same old measly food variations they have and the quantity is like a snack per meal.
I love how she pronounced hummus. As an Arab, I appreciate this effort! 😍
😍💕😊
I wanna try that broth!!!
So cute she is
I love you for having her 💪✨🌹🥢🥪🥟🥟🌭🥫🌮🥫🌮🥫🥧🥩🥡🥣🥡🥣🥧🥩🥫🌯🌮🥨🌭🥨🥨🥟
This is my favorite episode! Love her and love this! She’s def a mom bc she gives great advice! ❤❤❤😊👏🏽
Ukrainian immigrant. Showers only one in a week!
I like a nice papi too, I mean Popi
She's lazyyyy
I love the fact that I’ve seen her wearing the same blazer for other interviews ! It’s like “I’m a relatable woman who has her wardrobe and use it multiple time as normal people do “  Love her❤
I love this woman!
I am Polish and to be honest I have never heard of Russian borscht in my entire life. In Poland we call it Ukrainian borscht, as it should be called because it is Ukrainian. This is really confusing to me, just a few days ago she was saying how important being Ukrainian is for her, now she is confused again...Soviet occupation and forced russification doesn't change the fact that the land has always been Ukraine...I really like Mila but this a little bit disappoining, if you can't make up your mind about something it's better not to talk at all.
Gorgeous!
She seems so real I love her <33
We have the same routine lol 😂
Chocolate malted crunch 😋
Mila always seems so engaged and passionate in any interview she’s in. So humble and down to earth!
she’s literally the most relatable human being ever. like i aspire to be like her
I love how honest she is
love this - so smart - all the diet gurus gonna slam this and get more views nice work! Oh and great Netflix btw! Honestly Mila the world WOULD be dull without you!!
As a Ukrainian American, this resonated with me so much <3. Ukrainian mamas cook incredibly. My mama cooks the same things. Made me feel so good watching this.
I adore her
This Is me with My kids
Yep, chocolate malted crunch. In the freezer now.
She is sooooo lively and realistic  Love her
*allergic to dairy* I’d break the law for some oat milk ice cream
She's just so down to earth. I like that she's such a good mom
People are so stupid believing everything celebrities say.
OMG Yes!! Russian food, pelmeni, pickles, borshct! Yum yum. And of course ice cream. Best what I eat in a day ever!!!
did you shower before you came?
Just watched the movie ❤
i love her!!!
Love her ❤
I FREAKIN LOVE POPPI TOO but only the raspberry flavor. the rest are trash
You know they have Jeni's in the freezer, she just didn't want to sound snobby. It truly is worth every cent.
God bless!! 🙏🏼🤍
I’ve never noticed her accent until this video 😮
I just adore her. I think she’s funny and enjoyable to listen to/watch.
Damn she didnt say she takes a shower
I never noticed she has a slight accent until her recent interviews!!
Great video. She is so relatable! I want to know what smoothie and meal companies she uses!
Hilarious & relatable
Omg she's the most relatable celebrity
WE HAVE THE SAME FAVORITE ICE CREAM FLAVOR!!
please od videos with your moms soup and anything please!
"You can not. And that's okay " 👍 well said.
Her netflix movie was fantastic so surprised really really good
She's so cute
A thrifty ice cream lady!
The vanilla almond creamer is my fav that's so funny.
This lady is barely surviving 😆 she's just eating left overs and eating bread
Borscht is Ukrainian not Russian
Borsch is Ukrainian. And she used to call herself Ukrainian too. Curious when it became confusing…
I love how real she seems!
Mila you should know varenyky and borscht are Ukrainian foods not of russian origin. It might not feel like a big deal to some, but this is an element of colonization and the erasure of Ukrainian culture to claim our indigenous foods and recipes as russian. Do better.
Luckiest girl alive is totally different,  awsome work
Baku girl here, all of this is super accurate for us Russians/Ukrainians. Love it!
i love how you can tell she’s replaying her daily routine through her head as she speaks, feels more genuine
"I don't cook two meals, because I'm not a restaurant" 😂
my mom is so similar! her polish mom taught her to took "with her heart" and its just amazing food always
That's my favorite ice cream, too! The memories!
Ugh I just love her !!!💕💕💕💕 I also love Dave’s Killer bread 🍞
It’s the mcdonalds ice cream machine for me 😂 often broken 😂
Dope
I love her!
Why does each interview start with the first thing they do when they wake up? Why not start with the first thing they eat when they wake up? I just think it’s a weird way to start these videos.
Why is she yelling
I honestly love anything about her
She eats like such a normal person
Everyone just says what they do … it’s never about food lol
I like her but calling Borscht a Russian dish then not being sure if she should call herself a Russian or a Ukrainian was bit ridiculous tbh, especially with the current invasion of Ukraine by Russia. I'm Polish but I was legit offended for Ukraine listening to this...
The opposite of a bad mom
Yes! Thrifty’s malted ice cream all day
☺️🤩😍
Love that she’s doesn’t waste food, I’m that way too
Just watched Luckiest Girl Alive..amazing piece..  I wanna know where they got that pizza in the movie! 🍕🍕🍕
Literally thought no one knew what green da e killers bread was
omg yesss I've been waiting on this
She’s so down to earth and relatable
idk why, because at the end of the day i know celebrities are still human, but it's weird to hear them talk about doing things like taking their kids to school lol
the actual title of this video should be "what mila kunis' children eat in a day" 😄
The nightmare before Christmas is never going to be on Instagram You are not even worth calling evil or demented you are at the point of realization reincarnation as your path of choice. Enjoy the tunnel of sleep
Ooh this is the detail I like to hear in a what I eat in a day hahaha. Still short but descriptive
( the luckiest girl alive ) is actually a good film.......she looks great in it
It is such a pleasant surprise to see how down to earth and relatable she is.
Why do all these Hollywood “stars” look like Vampires?
Cutest couple ever!!!!!
Russian soup? Can she settle?
She is so authentic! You can feel she is not faking so people can relatated!
I am LIVING for this!!! This is the most relatable celebrity diet recap I’ve ever seen… Moms unite over leftovers from their kids, and eating dessert after the kids are in bed! YASSSSS!!!!
I love it how she doesn’t waste food she is so down to earth too
Considering she could go out to the best place to eat she prefers her Mom's cooking & her cooking & she does it all with her family & kids, I truly Love Mila
I love that she is so family oriented! Very refreshing to see a celebrity enjoy her family so much!
The Coffee is probably the most relatable thing ever.  Drip coffee maker, Oatmilk creamer done lol
Now when does she bathe 🤭
I saw luckiest girl alive and the progress of her on bad moms amazing she’s going places loved that movie great representation of our society!!!
This is 100% my favorite one of these!
I don’t think she eats. I’ve seen her to go grocery stores in la with Ashton and not get anything
It’s weird how she detaches herself from her moms heritage and goes that’s her heritage you come from the same blood
You ruined your eyebrows. Just because a trend is in you shouldn’t just follow it. Your eyebrows don’t match your face. Can you go back to your natural brows or is this a tattoo
We loveee herrr❤❤❤❤
she was so clearly a ukrainian refugee or whatever
Borsch is Ukrainian, not Russian.
she's so personable
"Cause I'm not a restaurant" lol I love her
I love how her where she has of her privilege, every time she says we’re lucky enough to…
You described what a teenager eats what I was expecting green goddess salads and beet juice 😮
Love that her and Ashton enjoy the same things! Like ice cream which I personally also LOVE. Love them so much as a couple and as people. 😊
Okay I know I'm probably jealous of her freezer size if she can store tons of ice cream and frozen fish in it for months.
Ngl, that was very relatable. I was worried it was going to be a Kardashian situation with chefs and giant salads. (I dont watch the show but i do sometimes watch a woman on youtube that parodies them so thats where i get my kardashian knowledge 😂)
Laid back relatable and beautiful ♥ Ashton a lucky guy
I love her so much 🥹
Ummm, Mila thanks for being normal AF. ❤
❤
she just ruined that video by saying "ruzzian people".. darn!! did you not say you are from Ukraine? Make up your mind!
What a breath of fresh air in a world full of Kardashian fakeness. 💛
❤ ✿❧🌿❧✿ ❤
MORE WHAT I EAT IN A DAY!!! can you do the Rock for Black Adam? Or like....that hot guy from 365 days?
With all the hundreds or thousands million of dollars that she have and she never waste food or hardly spends money is very weird hahaha  Give some to us 😂
As a Mila, I can relate ❤️‍🔥🍴 gotta love her
You can tell she s not really a foodie 😂
Yum I love dill … her mom’s food sounds so tasty
I love Mila!!   I’d also love to see Selena Gomez on this series!! 💛
Hey Harpers Bazaar and Mila Kunis! Don’t you think it’s not appropriate to call Ukrainians and Russians as “whatever, one nation” in the time of genocide? Ukranians are totally different nation, Russians stole our history, our achievements, our songs and part of our culture, they did a good job fooling the whole world and you are a great example of the russian propaganda effects. You still think borsch is russian even though it’s protected by UNESCO as Ukrainian national dish? Shame and shame. We need to work together now to cancel Russia and relearn everything we know about it
Everything she says you know is completely authentic, she doesn't put on this annoying persona for the cameras. She's obviously so beautiful as it is but her realness and humility make her that much more attractive. Love her!
This video is brought to you by Hello Fresh.
When this video was recorded? Mila would definitely not say that she doesn’t know who she is nowadays..Ukrainian or russian..wtf.. also saying that Borscht is a russian dish.. what in the hell?
She doesn't know to call herself anymore? russian or Ukrainian? A total disrespect for  all Ukrainians, especially saying all of that after russian full-scale invasion!
She doesn't take dairy in her coffee, but she loves ice cream LOL!!  I find it so hard to believe that she takes her kids to school and that she doesn't have at least 1 or 2 maids in her house helping with all the cooking/cleaning etc.  You know, it would be refreshing if actors/actress would give credit to the people who help them run their household.
Lol I love her realness! Best and most honest food diary. If you got kids you felt this 😂❤
I truly appreciate the specifics in this vid because she explains everything which is awesome
Love her, I like the silk oatmeal cookie creamer more lol agree to disagree Mila!
I thought she's a Ukranian...
I love her she’s so real. I feel the same way about Poppi!!! 🤣
Thanks mila now I want McDonald’s cone!!!😂😂😂 they are the bomb. Yes their machine is always broken. I agree.
I’ve been rewatching that 70 show and omg she still looks so good how
Imagine having enough money to eat what u actually like😒😅 rice and bread are my favourite loool
Mom life….. I eat whatever we have. “I don’t cook two different meals because I’m not a restaurant”……. How many of us have said that! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish she truly started accepting her legacy since calling Ukrainian dishes russian (which they aren’t) is very offensive and frankly speaking nowadays just quite irresponsible. With all gratitude for what she’s been doing for Ukraine I hope she drops this habit and the sense of inferiority
I love this! Very relatable especially as a mom Eating their leftovers for breakfast before you make your own food  And sneaking junk food with the hubs after the kids are asleep 😂 same girl same
I really wish she was vegan
You are Ukrainian, Mila. Do not call Ukrainian food Russian. You have donated for Ukraine …. Why you say like that? Russians kill Ukrainian people just because they are Ukrainian. WTF people, how you see this satiation from America?
I guess I’m gonna buy a pot of ice cream tomorrow cause I’ll be craving it all weekend now!!!
Loved this!
She is my spirit human. 🤍✨
By far the most realistic
I'm half Polish and half off our DNA is dill 😂 and the other half is pierogi!
She's great, love her :)
Ok, so @Harpers Bazaar is blocking my comment, because they don’t like the truth. Mila Kunis doesn’t know who she is and that is totally fine up to that point when she is blurring the borders between Ukrainians and russians. We are two completely different nations! And what is also important borsch is a 100% Ukrainian dish.
Her voice sounds different from what I remember. I often treat myself to Poppi's Raspberry Rose on Friday nights. In my mind it's a healthier pop alternative - who know if that's actually true.
I have Russian friends and as she was describing her moms cooking it was spot on to my friends cooking. AND ITS SO GOOD. Unless you hate dill 😂
I love her! Also, love that she’s plugging some of Ashtons investments😅 misfit market
omg the coffee thing is me 1000p
Shut up Meg 🤣 Kidding I love her 😅💓
Calculate the cost of this, it's about $80 per person per week. No excuse to not eat healthy! It's special doable!
I don’t understand how she mixes up Russian and Ukranian when she was born in Ukraine
get Andrew Lowe in here, stat!
We like the same creamer! Besties🤗
Oh god, Mila keeps giving me reasons to love her even more (I thought it was impossible) but she loves ice cream as much as me :')
« I’m not a restaurant »
Best one so far. 👏
Ice cream is my favorite food...group.  Relatable 😂
Luv her so much! 💜 💜 💜
I’ve loved her since she was on that 70’s show!❤️❤️❤️❤️
She's the best and an authentic person. Great food diary.
Love this womannn
just a bite for her kids LMFAO
Oddly enough, despite the source being a celebrity this video is inspiring me to save money and eat more at home and not waste any food 🙏🏼
Anyone like Menchie 's frozen yogurt?! It's good. Sometimes I have that or Blue Bell's Bride Cake...
I looooooooove her ! Like 4 real, I’m such a fan, love from Mexico City 💜💜💜
i love the food her mom cooks i grew up eating  home cooked food
normally i cant stand these what i eat in a day but this is by far the best one purely for Mila's personality and wit
I love her honesty. I tend to skip lunch too. It never seems tk work with my schedule
I was always wondering what does it mean when actor says' I am working from home '...?
💙💛
jeez so she's talking about ukraine now everywhere and yet it's been almost 8 months of war and she doesn't know what to call herself: ukrainian or russian gosh what a woman..
“It’s not even organic” lmao
HOW HAS SHE NOT AGED
I love how down to earth and super chilled she is
Okay but that’s the first celeb what I eat in a day where I don’t fell like unaesthetic shit after 😂
HER CHEEK IMPLANTS LOOK GOOD 👍👍
You're kidding? Ukrainian is talking about her specific oatmealvanillacreamblablabla when people in Ukraine have nothing to eat because of russia's terrorism? Awful!!
She sounds like she realizes the slight ridiculousness of this series :) Love her.
I’m honored to be this early to the queens video
God bless Mila for having the most relatable food diary I’ve seen so far. 🙏🏼 Like I swear this literally sounds like a day in my life.
this is the first time ive ever seen someone share my fondness for pineapple + olive pizza i feel seen
I also eat ice cream everyday ^^
One time for Poppi and Ollipop 🎉
This made me happy!
I love her!
Very natural like non celebrities do in a typical day .I hateto hear all organic that we cannot even afford lol.
It's very heartbreaking  to hear that she don't know is she ukrainian or russian...
We love her because she is so real and doesn’t try to be fake for the cameras. S/O to all the parents out there ❤
is this nilam farooq?
You can tell she spends time with her kids by saying what they like to eat too :)
thrifty ice cream was always my fav
I loved this food diares so honest😂
Don't know why I feel that this is a 'politically correct' food video. Don't get me wrong, I love Mila and her work. But everything she says in this video is to try to appear normal, from calling herself an asshole when she has specific coffee requirements to mcdonalds soft serve, and mention the fish boxes from her dad is not expensive. What a strange strange world we live in that even personal preferences about food, how we eat and what we eat, have to be the same as everyone else and acceptable for everyone.
She is very relatable.
She's giving me "Bad Moms" vibes I love it
I love this girl 💓😍 she is always such a sweet and very funny presence 🤣😂 my kids are the alarm ⏰🚨
Good God, I love this woman. She's just pure fun!
Great video and I love Mila Kunis she is a great actress.😄
This is the realest one yet
I like that she takes us through her whole morning routine. Not just what she eats, but her “tinkle” routine too!🤣
When I don't look directly at the screen I just can't get rid of the thought that it's Meg Griffin's food diary and not Mila Kunis
Good job sweet girl 💚👍
